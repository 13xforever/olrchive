9929	14011	Former PlayStation executive Sean Layden says that the console power arms race has plateaued.
14251	20595	As quoted by Video Games Chronicle, Sean states, If you're playing your game and sunlight is coming through your window onto your TV, you're not seeing any ray tracing.
20735	21956	It has to be super optimal.
22116	24777	You have to have an 8K monitor in a dark room to see these things.
25077	27739	Are details you can't see worth the higher power requirements?
28379	29840	This is the Prognostication Intro.
30040	34643	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, James Somerson, Loki, to tell you more about what he said in the rest of the week's gaming news.
34863	36924	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice...
39403	41885	Well, hello, my friends out there on the internet.
41925	46788	Welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
47869	52432	We are here to talk about video games, video gaming, gamer lifestyle, all that good stuff.
52552	58316	Myself, Rob Roberts, here with you as always, and my co-host, the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
59277	59577	Hey.
59877	60458	Hello, hello.
60518	60898	How are you?
63917	89013	are you dressed irritated is your vtuber oh well i want to get into that but i also want to ask is your vtuber dressed in an aperture laboratories outfit like portal or something yes like shelly yes it is a chill costume that's it i love it because i have to have costumes i think last year i did uh one of the ada wong outfits so we'll see what costume i do next time who knows
89833	90193	I love it.
90234	92096	It is that time of year for costumes.
92296	92576	Love it.
92897	94058	I know you have a rant in you.
94118	96961	I want to get to it, but I don't want to make Techmaster Loki wait.
96981	97822	So I want to say hi, Loki.
97862	98142	How are you?
98953	99733	Hello, pretty good.
99974	111219	I am so curious what this is playing behind you as we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.
112100	116502	And you've got some very... Is this like MineCon or something that's playing behind you?
116702	117322	No, no, no.
117422	123806	So this is the new... I don't even know if it's open yet, but this is the Minecraft experience.
123886	125446	It's a villager rescue.
125506	126367	It's a live...
126927	154401	experience that they put together in Dallas, Texas where you go and you play in these physical rooms that are projected with stuff and you interact with everything on the walls I don't want to talk too much about people who aren't here but a streamer I watch I'm almost positive was saying something about going on the road soon to be behind the scenes type of work at that event so that's kind of funny I forgot that was a thing until now you're saying I'm like oh it actually looks really neat though
155168	183612	yeah it looks pretty cool apparently the whole game is like built in Unreal Engine and stuff and you know based off of like some of the stuff I've watched you know it looks pretty involved so it'd be fun apparently it's going on the road at some point but right now it's in Dallas I ain't flying out there for that but it's still cool you drive to SF for it San Francisco right or maybe even LA maybe I would go to that in San Francisco
183772	184252	It looks better.
184272	184633	Yeah, I know.
184693	185973	I would go to that in San Francisco too.
186594	188015	I'm not even the Minecraft fan, Loki.
188295	199942	I think, DarkSakura, you and I just need to shove Loki in a burlap sack and take him to San Francisco for like an unbirthday present or something if this thing shows up in San Francisco because I'm like, I actually want to go.
200022	200942	This looks kind of fun.
201002	203124	Rob, are you suggesting that we have a team building?
203784	205105	A team building event?
205305	206166	A team building event.
206886	229772	so that'd be a lot more fun than what like my work wants to do for team building my work for team building they're like hey you know how you like work your remote what if we just didn't do that for three days three days that's right three days um and and for our team building we're just gonna have meetings and we're gonna work in the office and uh that's it fun it's like
231260	232621	You just don't get it, do you?
233541	241526	When people voted whether they wanted to work in the office or not, there was one person who was like, I miss everybody, I want to go in the office, and that person quit.
242907	244628	Nobody wants to work in the office.
245589	251532	It's only us that are local to the main office that are so lucky to participate in this.
251612	256035	Everybody else gets a pass because they're actually further out remote.
257436	259317	My work just went to a hybrid thing.
260799	266582	I'm going to refrain from comment on this because there's an element of this that touches my job and I don't like to cross the stream, so to speak.
266622	276546	But I will say as far as team building goes, I have gotten to in the past do an escape room with my team members.
276626	277886	And that's actually a lot of fun.
277926	281688	But the funny thing is my like our ultra competitive sides all come out.
282769	289515	It's really funny because I learned that I'm not the only hyper-competitive person in my workplace.
289715	291236	There are plenty of other people.
291336	298202	I worry if anybody ever suggests we do Survivor or something really cutthroat for a team-building event.
298283	301545	I think I'm going to sit this one out because this is going to be dangerous.
301646	305029	I will be fired if we do this as a team-building event.
305809	307871	And see, I like cooperative stuff.
308132	309453	I don't like competitive stuff.
309493	310394	I like cooperative stuff.
310414	312436	And the escape room is cooperative, to be fair.
312456	314598	The only hyper-competitiveness is against the puzzle.
314958	315699	So it's fine.
316379	316620	Yeah.
317400	317481	Um...
318482	319183	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
337364	338505	I kind of missed it.
338785	343669	We got rid of the FUs of the Week some time ago because gaming culture is unfortunately angry enough.
344089	351515	But once in a while, once in a while, there's something that necessitates a special revival of the FUs of the Week segment.
351535	355258	So, DarkSakura, by all means, do you have an FU of the Week you'd like to give out?
356354	356714	I do.
357715	363337	And it is to my experience on Dead by Daylight as of late.
363437	368499	And I'm not specifically saying that it's for behavior or G-Force or whatever.
369019	378243	I'm saying it's toward my experience because I'm sure that there are things that are out of people's hands, but there's been just things that have been distasteful to me.
378563	381744	I think distasteful is a good way to phrase it, right?
381845	384766	I think I need more to drink also before I go on this, but anyway.
385846	393874	So, after the update that happened on last Tuesday, that's the 8th, isn't it?
396056	405644	Every time I load into a match with my friends, so I will henceforth be referring to this as a SWIFT or survive with friends.
408206	412809	As soon as we get past loading perks, my game freezes and boots me out.
413129	416011	Granted, I play on the GeForce experience.
416051	420333	I pay for the highest tier and the best of all of the stuff, so I get a great experience.
421554	426437	I'm using Steam in GeForce to play Dead by Daylight.
426957	429018	Okay, there's the thing.
429559	433681	I play on a Mac Studio 64-bit M2 Ultra.
434022	436083	So my machine is no slouch.
436904	439405	All right, we're going to be now going back to the situation.
439505	440686	So this has been happening.
441367	446410	And me, being a tech person, I have gone through so many different ways.
446430	447631	Like, I've tried it with...
448891	454635	SoloQ, I've tried Killer, I've tried Custom Matches, I've done this and that.
454875	457757	I can play Killer, sometimes it still boots me out.
459258	465242	I could not do SoloQ at all for a while, and then I was able to do SoloQ for a little bit.
465342	467684	You know, it still is problematic.
469045	472487	I have gone through and checked that the appropriate...
474328	477790	ports necessary for GeForce are open, and they are.
478530	480631	I have gone through all of my network utilities.
480751	482271	I have changed nothing.
482691	488934	My connection with GeForce is probably double what their recommended settings are.
489014	491035	I have come out exceptional in all things.
491895	496558	So I started off with behavior and I said, this is what's going on.
496698	497879	I cannot give you logs.
497939	499280	I play through this method.
499920	501802	I have VODs of this happening.
501842	502702	I have screenshots.
502742	505784	I have timestamps because again, I'm a tech.
506224	506485	Okay.
507565	530286	and and so I went through all the things like okay well we consider this this closed you go talk to GeForce now and I was like and first of all I also made sure no VPNs no nothing and I I also want to take a step aside that if anyone tries to give me tech support please bear with me if I get irritated at it because it's what I do I've done everything trust me
531107	531988	I know my computer.
532168	534849	And PC Advice as a little bearing for a Mac.
534889	537491	So to be clear, you did turn it off and then on again.
538431	538791	Rob.
540412	540932	I had to.
541193	541653	I had to.
541773	542073	Come on.
543174	543754	Several times.
543934	544234	Okay.
544414	545315	Yes.
545935	546235	Anyway.
546355	553680	Oh, I even went so far as to go into my activity monitor and disable all of the background elements related to GeForce and then completely reboot it in system.
554240	555881	So yeah.
557061	557822	Anyway, anyway, anyway.
558602	558882	So...
560632	564354	Things started to work for a little bit and then it just went right back to it again.
569778	575121	And then I got another error this time for their anti-cheat that they use.
575401	576842	What is it called again that they use?
576902	577563	Easy anti-cheat?
578467	585732	I got an error this time that popped up that said that it detected something and that it crashed because of that.
585752	587774	I saved that screenshot.
590036	595219	So they're like, I'm sorry the issue came back while you're playing.
595319	599022	In this case, I'll ask you to kindly reach out to GeForce, blah, blah, blah.
599082	600543	We consider this closed, blah, blah, blah.
600603	600823	Okay.
601084	601404	So I said...
601624	603405	I don't consider this solved.
603505	607066	All of my other games connected perfectly to GeForce on my Steam accounts.
607486	609607	The issue has been isolated to Dead by Daylight only.
609727	611488	I'm not going to go into where I work.
612648	614029	I understand the back end quite a bit.
614889	624733	What I don't understand is if all other multiplayer experiences work in other games using both Steam and GeForce, why would Dead by Daylight be the outlier and then specifically in Swift Matches?
625473	627934	Secondly, this came about with the update from 10.8.24.
628034	630896	Third, GeForce reported no connection issues.
631296	634138	Fourth, the last error I received was specific to easy anti-cheat.
634418	636279	I have screenshots and timestamps if it helps.
636619	637980	I would like my case to be escalated.
638700	645304	I did, however, go through GeForce as well and let them know all of the things.
645884	651707	And finally, I did get a reply from Behavior that says, we'll be investigating this to the best of our abilities.
651807	654729	We are going to be, you know, essentially, they're escalating the case.
655109	656289	We're paying attention to you.
656349	656869	Congrats.
657570	659210	GeForce is doing the same thing.
660370	664652	And yes, Ranma, I know you do.
664752	665872	I knew you would feel it.
665932	666692	And I feel it.
667032	670433	I work on the side that escalates this shit.
671353	672334	I gather the logs.
672514	673294	I do the stuff.
673334	677555	That's why I need to do all this shit to try to make their jobs as easy as I could.
680036	682776	I respect what my fellow techs do.
683257	683897	And I also
685037	698470	I do understand that sometimes it's easy to say, oh, well, it can't be this, it has to be this, when you do not put aside any aspect of it just in case.
700052	701473	The answer to this isn't in my book.
703348	703588	Right.
704008	723640	So, and for me, like, what I'll even do is, like, even if I know something, you know, in my heart, in my gut, just isn't necessarily the right thing, I will still do the escalation to check with the people who know the coding better than I do to check that for me and be a thousand percent positive that I am not just dismissing this.
724520	725721	Out of hand, you know?
726341	728282	It also seems obvious to me.
728822	732584	You've been playing, streaming Dead by Daylight without issue all this time.
732964	735025	You didn't change anything on your end.
735045	736265	It was the update.
736285	737166	Yeah, the update.
737246	740968	A patch goes out by Dead by Daylight, and then all of a sudden it's broken.
741288	745730	A patch, by the way, which made major changes to surviving, right?
745770	750352	Because it has the whole, the mores that happen at the end automatically now and all this stuff, right?
750392	752773	So there's very clearly changes happening.
753053	758379	And I was getting booted out of the occasional killer match on top of it.
760221	762504	I could do a kill your friends match.
762864	766428	I could not be a survivor in a custom match with my friends.
766708	770613	I mean, it seems pretty obvious to me that the problem is this patch.
772364	784626	and specifically the way it's working with uh with uh specific networking like when you've got multiple people going into one instead of just a mass queue right so um
786635	788095	I'm following the channels.
788235	789376	I'm doing all the things.
789696	794177	I can play Dead by Daylight on stream with some difficulty.
796157	797377	My friends have been great.
797417	800978	They've been hanging out in my chat while I play killer matches and everything.
801038	802858	And I've had fun doing Kill Your Friends.
803158	809539	I can certainly do a few things to gather other content for other things.
809859	812100	But it is very frustrating.
812900	828786	and I mean and I flat out was like I hate to be that person but I've spent a lot of money on this game okay I spent a lot of money on the services I have been pretty hardcore loyal since I started you know and to have this happen you know
829466	833349	And I've been, you know, I've been pretty, pretty upfront too.
833369	843076	It's like, I will be discussing this in, in, you know, on my podcast, on my, on my forums, on my social media, all of it.
843136	856566	I'm going to be public about this because, you know, I'm not going to be like a, you know, a stupid Karen about it, but I am going to be a concerned person that wants to get my, what I'm paying for, you know, and keep...
858108	865116	The question I have is that you can't be the only person on planet Earth using GeForce Now to play Dead by Daylight or that wouldn't be in there.
866257	869161	So I'm kind of curious, where are the other people maybe having issues?
869381	871464	I've seen a few reports here and there.
871624	872545	Okay, because I'm like...
873005	877788	We're not really a major market.
878269	881471	Isn't GeForce now something that has a free tier?
881671	883152	I still don't remember I've used it in the past.
883172	883492	It does.
883512	885453	It's like an hour that you get to play.
885554	887495	It's ridiculous and not very good.
887655	890197	I wonder if I should try to log in and see if Dead by Daylight works.
890877	892438	Or file a ticket and help.
893019	894820	I'll file a ticket too.
895080	900183	But the thing is that you would need to do a Swift match to test it specifically the way that I'm doing it.
901204	902225	And you are on a PC.
903145	903325	Yeah.
903626	903986	That's it.
904847	905427	I'm on a Mac.
906468	908950	But on top of that, like, I have... I have a Mac.
910311	912753	Yeah, but your Mac won't run it very well.
913754	915295	I can tell you that right now.
915495	916336	Even though it's cloud?
916356	917376	I thought because it was cloud.
917857	918117	Oh, well.
918832	924693	No, no, because you still have to have the RAM allocation to run other stuff.
924993	925894	All right.
926134	928594	But at any rate, well, and add another thing on there.
928634	933796	Now, I noticed that my Wi-Fi was on and I normally play hardwired.
933836	936056	So I switched my Wi-Fi off and switched to hardwire.
936796	938657	And oh, yay, a match worked.
938897	942238	And then I played on stream and no, it didn't.
942998	945038	So I was like, the fuck, man.
945798	946679	So, yeah.
950278	952319	PodCulture, you could probably get away with it.
952359	953820	It depends on your RAM.
953860	960505	Your processor isn't going to be as... If you've got 16 or more, you should be able to test it just fine.
961866	967669	I was playing on an M1 Mac before, and now Dan has that Mac, and I'm playing on an M2 Mac.
968610	969831	It's M2 Ultra, M2 Pro.
969871	970632	I have to look again.
971032	974495	But my Mac Studio is more than capable of it.
975335	980839	And I would also like to throw in that there is that pop-up that happened with the easy anti-cheat.
980900	983842	I'm saving every screenshot and every piece of documentation.
984302	993469	Just because, you know, I've learned in my line of business that this is what you need to do when you're dealing with shit like this.
993509	995511	So it sounds like the anti-cheat might also be
995851	996713	Part of the problem.
996774	999782	Like somehow the way the patch interfaces the anti-cheat.
1000584	1001145	And you know what?
1001225	1003812	If it wasn't for their anti-cheat, I could play with whiskey.
1005987	1032960	which I've gone over what Whiskey is before for anyone who knows Linux and Mac OS and Unix systems Wine is a Windows sort of emulator for applications and this uses a combination of the game porting kit built into Mac OS and Wine to play games I played, well I mean now since it's out of beta
1036750	1040514	Um, they, uh, what's the word I was gonna say?
1040815	1042316	Um, I can talk about it.
1042496	1045299	So, I could run Project T, no problem.
1045360	1047422	I can play What the Fog, no problem.
1047962	1050045	I can play Hooked on You, no problem.
1051086	1055891	Um, well, yeah, it is an emulator, exactly, Bobby.
1056411	1058113	Um, but, um...
1060254	1089311	I would say almost more like a virtual environment simulator, emulator, blah blah blah and so I also want to point out and this is a rewind back they did ask the question can you simulate this can you play on another device and I was like I have no other device in which to play this I do not own a PC that is functional right now I don't play on console what's the point
1090206	1092267	I have my working copy of the game.
1092627	1094307	I don't need to be able to play it on anything else.
1095408	1098389	So I was flat out up front.
1098769	1105851	Now maybe it might be worth it for me to get a PS4 version or something cheap and test it out.
1105931	1106391	I don't know.
1106411	1108372	That's a no, you shouldn't have to.
1109494	1111196	I shouldn't have to pay anything to do that.
1111656	1113698	It reminds me of when my Final Fantasy was broken.
1113738	1116821	It had the sound issues and I did end up having to go buy it.
1116841	1127052	It was right when Endwalker came out and I knew it was related to that and I had to end up buying the PS4 version of the game just so I could finish the freaking story before all the spoilers hit the internet and that was really annoying.
1128007	1130369	I'm sure I can find the PS4 version.
1130449	1134732	And I think now that they have the cross-play enabled... Yeah, you'll have everything.
1135052	1135352	You will.
1135633	1137254	Yeah, I can bring all my stuff back.
1137294	1139455	But I hate playing Dead by Daylight with a controller.
1139836	1141837	Yeah, I get it.
1141997	1143518	I'm a keyboard mouse person.
1143599	1145120	I know how I play.
1145920	1148142	Maybe I can actually look behind me when I run.
1148840	1149100	You know?
1150221	1152521	But still.
1153182	1155603	So that's what I've been dealing with with Dead by Daylight.
1155643	1163465	And that's why my streams have been, for anyone who is watching, have been named what they are.
1163485	1164986	I'm playing a lot more Palia lately.
1167527	1172149	So it's frustrating for me because...
1173249	1194034	I see some of the same, and this is now going into a little bit more about being tech support and working in tech support and having that knowledge is that we kind of do have a tendency to dismiss the layperson or to assume that anyone who is messaging us is a layperson, especially in games, I've noticed.
1195034	1197155	And I think the best thing...
1198115	1208813	and this is now why like here out usually when I do have to open a ticket or call in for something I specify I work in tech and this is where I work
1209989	1215694	And typically when they find out where I work, they're like, oh shit, okay, we know you know what you're doing, right?
1215995	1220539	Well, it's also, I feel very Comcast when I used to call them because the internet was down.
1220639	1222201	Yes, I've turned it off and on again.
1222621	1225884	Yes, I've done, like, it's the same thing.
1225904	1228707	Oh no, all I have to do is tell them where I work and they escalate me.
1229107	1231890	I don't have any more, so.
1233908	1238550	I'm still with them, but we got a great... We're on Gigabit here.
1240030	1250334	But anyway, so the big thing is that it's all going to be the channels you take.
1250374	1256996	You have to know, when you are on the consumer side, you have to understand that...
1259142	1266724	Elimination, narrowing it down to the right item, will point you in the direction of the channel that you need to go to.
1267184	1269225	Now, I did do both channels.
1269385	1272786	It could very well be related to both items working in tandem.
1272906	1279568	So that's why I accepted to contact GeForce as well as continue my work with Behavior Tech Support.
1280308	1287530	I've also sent them like five different misspellings and grammatical corrections to make in Dead by Daylight stuff.
1287910	1288030	So...
1289396	1295597	Oh yeah, some of the cosmetic descriptions are just like completely poorly written.
1296197	1297758	Like bad grammar, bad spelling, all of that.
1298078	1299878	You don't put out a... Yeah.
1300378	1300578	Anyway.
1300638	1300938	Anyway.
1302739	1304239	But yeah, that's what I'm dealing with right now.
1304779	1308780	Alright, well, sorry to hear it, but that is kind of interesting.
1308800	1316241	And I think to kind of the point you made at the end there, I think is worth kind of revisiting and kind of underscoring a little bit.
1316301	1318402	That sometimes we kind of write off
1318962	1326508	A lot of these concerns pretty quickly, especially in the gaming space, so that we make assumptions that the person on the other end of the line doesn't know what they're talking about, type of thing.
1326528	1327949	Like, there often is an assumption there.
1328649	1330631	And you're right, that happens a lot in the gaming space, too.
1330811	1336595	And so I think it's, I think it's just, I don't know if there's, like, something we sit here and say, we gotta do it, but we gotta do it.
1336655	1339657	But it's like, knowing is half the battle, as G.I.
1339697	1340138	Joe said.
1340518	1341679	Now you know, and knowing is half the battle.
1341699	1341839	Yeah.
1342239	1344101	There is one piece of advice I'd like to throw out there.
1344201	1347085	Please.
1347886	1348967	This is consumer side.
1348987	1360741	When you are working with tech support and they have referred you to another party, ask them their process of elimination that led to that and what do you ask the other party.
1361872	1362312	DarkSakura.com
1386267	1391449	that you have to ask the questions and understand how that conclusion was reached.
1391589	1403934	And not only does that give you more ammunition to seek the answer in the right place, but it also teaches you how your system's going to work so you can learn something to prevent it from happening next time.
1404494	1407455	And learn how to read your manual.
1408195	1409255	Read your user guides.
1409555	1410456	Read your instructions.
1410596	1412236	Look for online knowledge bases.
1413056	1416777	Knowing this information will save you a headache in the future.
1417237	1417678	The end.
1418178	1418538	All right.
1419578	1423999	Let's get into some news from the week, which admittedly is a little slower this week.
1424099	1426580	So that's why we have the space to talk a little more about this stuff.
1426660	1428160	But we do have some headlines to cover.
1428600	1434242	And Loki, I think you have one to start us off this week about what happened in Microsoft's world.
1435151	1444960	Yeah, so Microsoft did a kind of a partner showcase showing some of the more like, not necessarily like indie stuff, but like third party.
1445220	1451906	A lot of it is focused kind of on indie, but it was, yeah, their partner showcase, which had a bunch of trailers with it.
1452686	1456569	So we got some new trailers and some other further confirmations.
1456669	1467157	So there was another trailer for, of course, Alan Wake 2's Lake House DLC, which I think we saw before with the PlayStation showcase event.
1467217	1471260	So they confirmed that's now going to be coming on all platforms October 22nd.
1473982	1484005	And then, of course, we got a look at Bloober Team's new horror game, right off the back of Silent Hill 2 Remake, called Kronos, The New Dawn.
1484945	1486166	And it looks creepy.
1489166	1490627	It's not creepy, it's Halloween!
1492284	1497206	Yeah, we got a new announcement for a game called Blindfire.
1497586	1511710	It's a game by Double Eleven, whose artwork reminds me a bit too much of Cyberpunk, but it is kind of a Cyberpunk-ish style shooter, so it looks kind of cool.
1513340	1526067	and that's supposed to be coming out early access already actually right after the announcement on the Xbox Series X and S and PC then we of course had
1530075	1534638	I don't know if this is a crazy announcement, but it seems in line with the series.
1535218	1539020	So we have Like a Dragon, Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii.
1541682	1544964	It sounds crazy, but it's awesome.
1545244	1548926	I mean, those games have a lot of over-the-top shit in it, so why not?
1549066	1549586	Why not?
1549726	1551707	Pirate Ship, Hawaii, why not?
1552168	1552508	Why not?
1554228	1556452	It looks pretty awesome.
1556953	1559157	I am not really sure what to think of it, but...
1559981	1584922	I think it's cool could this be the next big pirate game I guess we'll find out uh will there be DLC for Sea of Thieves as a tie-in we will see I don't know it looks absolutely amazing though you know what's interesting though the game I did not realize this but Bobby uh you know we tape after he does and um he's a big Yakuza fan you know um and uh he mentioned they moved it a week up because of Monster Hunter
1585402	1587903	is coming out, was originally going to be that same day in February.
1588223	1595625	So they bumped it up to get out of the way of Monster Hunter, which, of course, you know, is fairly, I mean, it does well here, but it's huge.
1596045	1597425	It's event media in Japan.
1598645	1609508	Well, I can tell you, out of the two games, I'm more excited about the Like a Dragon Pirate game than I am Monster Hunter, so I will actually probably want to check that out.
1609868	1613489	It looks really... It just looks so crazy, it's like I have to
1613629	1629192	Monster Hunter mainline games I love the cell phone one the mainline ones are hard but I'll probably still try it I'll have space for this after I beat the other Like A Dragon games someday write it into my busy schedule
1629733	1651881	although this is um being a spinoff it's it's a guided adventure so it's not it's not like you're getting like a full like 50 70 hour game it's you know gonna be less than 20 but still pretty extensive no can't wait for those pirate takes of the old Sega classics right I think for for like oh WTF kind of parody like I think that's perfect for this actually so I think it'll be cool
1653158	1663892	Another game I've been kind of keeping my eye on ever since they kind of saw the work in progress visuals for it, but now actually having a subtitle to it, Mouse EI for Hire.
1664453	1665854	It's a black and white...
1668352	1668872	and DarkSakura.
1694564	1698147	on pretty much all consoles, so I'm definitely picking that up.
1698167	1702530	What's going public domain next year that we're going to have to suffer through horror adaptations of?
1702910	1705872	Well, it's not, yeah, I mean, it's not a horror game.
1705892	1717840	No, I'm just saying, sorry, I'm on the public domain thing now, and you know I do a lot in the horror space, and you know, anytime something goes public domain, somebody's doing some fucking movie about it, because now they can, so...
1719229	1724732	You know, because they did do a... Didn't they do a... They did a Steamboat Willie horror movie, but it was called something else.
1724812	1726373	But it was... And then, of course, Winnie the Pooh.
1726753	1727354	We all know that.
1727714	1728635	You know, and all that stuff.
1728675	1732857	So, like, as these go public domain, somebody's going to make a fucking horror movie out of it.
1732917	1734538	So, I'm just kind of curious what's next year.
1735078	1735499	But, sure.
1735839	1737540	Video games, Cuphead, cute.
1737840	1738640	I like that style.
1738700	1741382	Like, I'm not going to hate on it just because it's Steamboat Willie.
1741582	1742903	But, like...
1746562	1757206	If you're going to hate that we get all of these adaptations of Call of Duty Call of Duty this, Call of Duty that Call of Duty, Modern Warfare this, Modern Warfare that Then you know what, Steamboat Willie?
1757766	1758806	We have to get the same treatment.
1758926	1759207	Enough!
1760867	1765309	Yeah, so let's see What is entering the public domain next year?
1766089	1770591	Different creators I don't even know and I'm going to tell you how they're going to make a horror movie out of it
1772533	1800323	a lot of it is like composers and singers and stuff like that horror movie soundtracks they'll turn them into creepy versions that play in the trailers I mean these would be really old dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun this is like really obscure but there is a cartoon called Mutton Jeff I don't know what that is I know what Mutton Jeff is yeah so there's that uh
1802877	1805178	Marmatone is another cartoon.
1806119	1806900	Italian cartoon.
1810342	1812244	Alright, this is a rock I wish I hadn't looked under.
1812324	1813565	Go back to the Xbox.
1813605	1814325	A Dog's Life.
1814605	1815006	There you go.
1815066	1816066	A Dog's Life.
1816147	1817187	It's a 1914 movie.
1817287	1820530	Can't wait to see the horror version of that.
1820570	1822411	The dog inhales cocaine and kills people.
1822711	1823492	That's how they make a horror movie.
1823512	1824113	Cocaine Dog.
1824433	1825754	It's been derivative, but I can see it.
1825774	1826254	Cocaine Dog's Life.
1828756	1830037	Cocaine Dog's Life.
1831317	1832238	Isn't that a family guy?
1832858	1838342	Anyways, we had a trailer for Subnautica 2, and that's pretty exciting.
1838362	1840224	I know a lot of Subnautica fans.
1840704	1845207	It's coming out on Game Pass, Xbox, and PC.
1847689	1848429	Let's see, what else?
1848909	1851931	Animal Well, now coming to Xbox as well.
1851992	1853553	That was already on PC.
1854713	1859837	Eden's Zero confirmed it'll be coming to Xbox as well.
1860948	1887393	uh let's see uh Eternal Strands it's uh from the former creative director of Dragon Age and uh supposed to be also coming to Game Pass I remember this whole thing yeah yeah yeah yeah the folks uh yeah they say it looks like uh Breath of the Wild or like Phoenix uh Phoenix Rising or something like that so kind of open world RPG which in itself was also Breath of the Wild so yeah I get it
1889209	1914311	Miss Fall Hunter was announced a third person PvPVE extraction RPG set in a dark mysterious Nordic inspired continent coming next year on PC and Xbox Wheel World it's some bike racing sci-fi game I think this was called something else before and they renamed it but I just don't remember the original name
1915083	1915884	I don't know, looks neat.
1916904	1918405	It's interesting.
1918726	1923029	Phasmophobia is coming to consoles.
1923449	1929053	It's also going to be making its way to PlayStation 5 as well for the PSVR 2.
1930754	1932976	And it is coming out in the week.
1933296	1933997	So October 29th.
1934457	1935698	What else do you need?
1961078	1962099	It's a big fluffy dog.
1962119	1963479	Very large, fluffy dog's life.
1963539	1967021	It's so large that the main protagonist rides the dog.
1967441	1968022	And I love it.
1968862	1969983	The dog better not die.
1970003	1970983	I swear to God.
1972064	1972444	You're right.
1972544	1973805	The dog better not fucking die.
1975305	1976606	That should be the name of the game.
1976646	1977887	The dog better fucking not die.
1979268	1980568	It sounds like the never-ending story.
1980908	1982109	I'm thinking of that scene.
1983810	1988833	Anyways, Wu-Chang Fallen Feathers is a Souls-like action RPG.
1989853	1991835	Totally unique concept there.
1992175	1994977	Yeah, never heard of a Souls-like clone.
1995357	1996058	Never heard of that.
1996158	1997599	Never.
1997639	1998220	You know what?
1998460	2006326	I think back to the days of Street Fighter clones and Doom clones and... Ah, we miss those days.
2007567	2009048	It's now Souls-like clones.
2009088	2010369	Now bring back Street Fighter clones.
2011250	2012251	I miss Stick Fighter.
2013419	2014520	Stickfire is good, yeah.
2015720	2017281	FBC Firebreak.
2017481	2026306	It is a Left 4 Dead-style co-op shooter in the same universe as Control, and it looks pretty crazy.
2027146	2027786	Interesting.
2027886	2031488	So that means it's also the Alan Wake and the whole Remedy universe, right?
2032869	2033409	I guess, yeah.
2033449	2038692	It's a three-player co-op, and yeah, it looks pretty neat.
2042194	2042994	And that's pretty much it.
2044275	2065838	well that's you know for an October event that's uh that's pretty cool not bad yeah not bad interesting stuff in there so it's nice to see Xbox still kind of you know putting things out and you know has their plan and you know to stay competitive with everything else so making Game Pass something people want to have and all that good stuff so good for them all right
2066445	2068346	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2095371	2121243	uh was uh yeah i mean it's just the usual there you know i'm gonna play more dead by daylight tonight hopefully and i tried to play some fortnight so yeah fortnight i've been playing palio with with uh brad oh that's fun yeah i need to check that game out and marissa marissa plays love her oh if that's how i have to talk to her i'll install it i will i miss marissa great
2122577	2123657	All right.
2123717	2124537	Loki, we'll go to you then.
2124557	2125238	How was your gaming week?
2126238	2129138	My gaming week was pretty much Minecraft.
2129378	2134259	And then I'm playing Blue Sky, the app.
2135280	2139820	Actually, I'm glad you brought that up because Bobby went a little bit in depth on his show tonight.
2139920	2142201	But like, yeah, like a lot of people are leaving.
2143761	2147002	You know, OK, so now I have a tangent to the tangent.
2147978	2153239	I know that it's fine to deadname X and call it Twitter and everyone still calls it Twitter.
2153679	2161501	There's a part of me that wonders maybe that's the wrong mentality and we should call it X. And the reason why I say that is because Twitter died.
2161901	2162501	Twitter's gone.
2162941	2166682	Twitter got taken out to pasture and shot.
2167602	2168462	There is no more Twitter.
2169243	2174964	And so there's a part of me that's like, maybe we ought to call it X to make sure we remind ourselves Twitter is gone, right?
2175464	2175664	But
2176184	2200997	Whatever you want to call it, thanks to some of the changes that the idiot in charge made this week With the blocks, you can no longer With the block feature and AI Yeah, the AI thing is huge for artists I mean, a lot of people are talking about the blocks, but I think the AI thing is really pissing off artists But however you want to slice it, people are saying it's time to get off the boat And kind of like
2201517	2203059	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2220014	2221375	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2244465	2249267	If you want a feed for everything about DragonCon, for example, Bobby made a feed for that.
2250067	2253208	If you want a feed about everything Minecraft, I'm sure that's out there.
2254089	2255449	You just have to search the feeds for that.
2256770	2259411	Probably bumps that up to the top and so forth.
2259771	2264853	They also have what's called Starter Packs on Blue Sky.
2265033	2269214	Our pal Bobby Blackwolf actually made one of these over on Blue Sky.
2269635	2272696	If you go to the official VOG Network account, which...
2275039	2277860	The interesting thing about Blue Sky is that there's no check marks, right?
2277900	2279321	There's no verified badge.
2279401	2282542	But what you do is you verify your domain.
2282982	2287865	So there's a way you set it up where your username becomes your domain.
2288365	2295789	So for example, if I go to Blue Sky and I go to the VOG account, it's actually at vognetwork.com is that.
2295949	2296489	Whereas like
2296849	2301350	Most normie users like me, I'm like robroberts.bsky.social.
2301410	2303131	You know, most people have the .bsky.social.
2303451	2311753	You can actually pretty much authenticate yourself and prove who you are by tying yourself to your domain, which I actually think is a pretty clever way to do it, to be quite honest.
2312193	2317275	But if you go to our Blue Sky feed, which is at vognetwork.com, OLR doesn't have a separate Blue Sky account.
2318275	2321136	I guess now's the time to make one, so maybe I'll get on that.
2321196	2330079	But for now, if you go to atvognetwork.com, you can actually see there's a little starter pack, a Voice of Geeks Network pack, and you can actually follow all of us fun personalities.
2330400	2339403	There's me, there's Loki, there's Jamie, and even some of our host emeritus, such as Critical Myth, Pod Culture, and some of our just...
2340163	2365191	community members that really get involved like Mish love me some Mish and so forth so like community members that are just super involved we also have in the starter pack if you want to be in this if you're here every week and you want to be in the starter pack just give us a holler and we'll get you in the starter pack or give Bobby a holler I shouldn't say that but honestly I've been on there for a long time you know like I I I
2367239	2367799	I've loved it.
2368059	2369600	It's been a great experience for me.
2370260	2378484	And on top of that, since the TWAT site has become an anti-Semitic hotbed, it's very refreshing to be here.
2378704	2379765	Yeah.
2379885	2381845	And I will say this about Blue Sky, too.
2381925	2383046	I mean, it's not without look.
2383126	2384707	I'm not going to say, oh, it's perfect.
2385007	2385987	You'll think I'm on their payroll.
2386427	2392450	There are no pictures and DMs, and they've been promising that for a while, and I'm not sure what's been stopping them.
2392870	2394471	You can't upload your own DMs.
2394671	2395771	and Detaching Quoted Posts.
2420040	2422901	Yeah, the fact when you can remove yourself from a quote post.
2423221	2426021	And the fact when you block somebody, it's a hard fucking block.
2426601	2434963	And they cannot... Not only does it delete everything in the conversation you are having with that person, but they can't see you pretty much at all.
2435343	2440344	And you can actually set your account so that only people who are logged in can see your account.
2440844	2442784	You cannot have a private account.
2442944	2444585	And that is a deal breaker for some people.
2445045	2446225	And I think that's just because, again...
2447125	2449949	Blue Sky was not built to be a Twitter replacement.
2451091	2458422	It was built to be an open source protocol and they sort of had different things in their vision and their things that they were going to accomplish.
2458923	2459464	And then...
2460393	2461293	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2484122	2487343	And plus it has the kind of like some people really police their domains.
2488784	2491144	The policing that happens on Mastodon is a bit much sometimes.
2492545	2493445	It ruins the vibe there.
2493885	2495826	So that's all I'm going to say about my experience there.
2495846	2501348	It almost sounds like IRC vibes with some of those domains and everything.
2501448	2501908	Actually...
2502707	2503287	You're not wrong.
2503447	2503907	You're not wrong.
2504188	2505108	You're really not wrong.
2505288	2505508	Yeah.
2506128	2514691	So, but again, like, I'm not, like, again, if somebody tells me, hey, I got rid of X and I went to Mastodon, I'm still going to say, good for you.
2514851	2515271	Good for you.
2515291	2515991	That was a good choice.
2516511	2518292	So, you know, I'm not here to hate on Mastodon.
2519252	2524334	I still have my account on the twats, is what I'm calling it.
2525414	2528315	Only because that's where I repost when I go live.
2528335	2528775	Mm-hmm.
2530020	2538403	I do keep up with a couple of people, but I really, really, really haven't been paying as much attention to it.
2538503	2540744	It's fading the way that I faded on Facebook.
2541404	2550027	I would say, though, one of the things I did find when I was starting up or building up my account is there's a...
2551548	2561451	An extension you can get for Chrome called Sky Follower Bridge that allows you to find people that you follow on X on Blue Sky.
2561491	2566733	And it's not perfect, but it does help you find a lot of people that you're following.
2566813	2568193	And that is a good way to start.
2568493	2571654	And then just, you know, go in those people and find who they're following.
2571734	2574315	And, you know, you may find everybody you're looking for.
2575436	2579157	There's another thing I've been using less of is things in Google's ecosystem.
2579577	2579697	Yeah.
2582493	2597097	Sky Follower Bridge, DJ Ranma S in chat who asked what's the name of that extension again and actually the official Blue Sky account actually I almost said tweeted the official Blue Sky account actually bleated about we need to get rid of the skeet thing
2598117	2599398	Posted?
2599438	2599939	Yeah, posted.
2600199	2601300	You know everybody calls us skeets.
2601320	2602661	And I'm like, we're not 12 years old, people.
2603521	2611267	And I'm like, if you want actual celebrities to come over to this site, but I think there are a lot of people perfectly happy with that not happening.
2611768	2613069	So I do kind of respect that.
2613109	2616571	But I'm also like, if you want to have Barack Obama
2617492	2620433	on this website, you're not going to be able to call it Skeets.
2620993	2623993	You need to have a name that works a little more professionally.
2624413	2631254	I like Bleat because it has the elements and it makes me think of the fun pinball killer in Dead by Daylight, the Bleat.
2636095	2637535	There's a few celebrities here and there.
2637595	2639296	Tiger Class says James Gunn is on Blue Sky.
2639356	2642616	Yeah, some of the Star Trek people.
2643736	2644777	The one that played Shaw.
2644997	2645257	No.
2645797	2645937	Todd
2647923	2671316	Dashwick Dashwick is on Blue Sky and Jerry Ryan is on Blue Sky that's a cool dude yeah and Jerry Ryan's like been very approachable on Blue Sky I think she's great so anyway don't if you're gonna go to Blue Sky though just don't fucking ruin the vibes don't ruin the vibes don't quote people that dunk on them just block them block them when I heard that
2672426	2674427	A certain... I'll just say Laura Loomer.
2674507	2677229	When I heard Laura Loomer showed up on Blue Sky, I just proactively blocked her.
2677610	2678810	I do not want to see her shit.
2679050	2680692	I don't care what she has to say.
2680812	2681432	I do not care.
2681512	2682133	I don't want to see it.
2682493	2683954	Nobody is owed engagement.
2684354	2684634	Done.
2684754	2685115	Blocked.
2685415	2686435	I won't ever have to see it.
2687516	2691019	Should the wizard book lady ever show up, I will be blocking her immediately.
2691419	2692099	Immediately.
2692179	2694281	I have no interest in anything that woman has to say.
2695447	2698129	until she offers a very meaty apology.
2698329	2698889	Meaningful.
2699650	2700470	Financial apology.
2700490	2701411	Like that's going to happen.
2701491	2701931	It's not.
2701991	2703973	That's why I'm okay with blocking her in a millisecond.
2704453	2705834	Anyway, yeah, don't ruin the vibes.
2705934	2706755	This is a joke when I'm mad.
2706795	2708896	Do not go to Blue Sky to ruin the vibes.
2709156	2711778	And if you are like, Blue Sky is a leftist haven.
2712038	2712559	You know what?
2712699	2713059	Great.
2713139	2713699	Stay where you are.
2714200	2714600	Great.
2715240	2716001	Glad we agree.
2716161	2716961	Bye.
2717242	2718783	I'm not saying Blue Sky is a leftist haven.
2719043	2723366	I'm just saying maybe you shouldn't be there then.
2725598	2727999	Anyway, we'll enjoy this while it lasts.
2728019	2729259	Something will fuck it all up.
2729399	2730099	It always does.
2730199	2731480	Something's going to fuck it all up.
2731980	2733300	But we survived.
2733920	2734280	You know what?
2734361	2739942	If you are of a certain age on the internet, you survived LiveJournal going away, RIP LiveJournal.
2740602	2742503	You survived Myspace going away.
2743103	2744803	You survived Friendster going away.
2746344	2749585	If you're in my rainbow clan, you survived Gay.com going away.
2749605	2749685	Okay.
2751551	2756855	You will survive X, Twitter, whatever going away as well.
2757216	2758236	We will rebuild.
2759738	2760018	All right.
2761479	2762500	Anyway, let's move on.
2762580	2763661	Oh, I should talk about my gaming week.
2763681	2765062	Loki, did you finish your gaming week?
2765482	2768504	I know you talked about Blue Sky turned into a 10-minute tangent or whatever.
2768585	2769205	Yes, I did.
2769605	2769805	Good.
2770866	2771547	My gaming week.
2772007	2773969	I've been playing Diablo 4 because, of course, I have.
2774029	2775610	And I've been enjoying the variety of activities.
2775650	2776531	I feel like I'm not bored.
2776551	2778372	Like, there's so many things to do in endgame.
2779013	2779813	And I've been enjoying it.
2779913	2780094	Yeah.
2780714	2782136	Diablo 4 Beauty and the Beast
2801977	2802478	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2818755	2825001	Watch the Beauty and the Beast one because something really funny happens halfway through and it was really fucking enraging at the time.
2825461	2827623	But it is really funny in retrospect.
2827663	2831767	So check that out and learn about the sensitivity of the Intellivision disc controller.
2831827	2836531	It is something to behold.
2837011	2842536	And then my Friday video, I played the original Metroid and I streamed that on Thursday night.
2842877	2843517	So here's the thing.
2844554	2851556	I was going to stream the original Super Mario Brothers and then I was going to do like a Mario Marathon, Mario 1, 2, and 3.
2852536	2861739	I severely underestimated how rough Super Mario 1 was going to go because I said, well, I'm going to do this without warping.
2862079	2865740	I'm going to make this look, because if I do, I'll beat this in less than 10 minutes if I use warp.
2866000	2867581	So I'm going to beat this without warping.
2868241	2871582	I forgot that you only have three lives in the game.
2872262	2876745	I have not perfected the 99 lives turtle staircase trick over the years.
2877065	2878906	Maybe that's something I need to practice.
2879126	2879806	I think I do.
2881167	2882868	And there's that.
2882948	2891893	And so I died in world three, which is fine because chat reminded me, oh, if you hit A and continue, you start at the beginning of the same world.
2892273	2892893	Not so bad.
2892973	2893274	Cool.
2893634	2897076	So then we kept going and I got to world five and I died again.
2897836	2899777	and I forgot to hit a continue.
2899937	2902997	My brain just reflexed and said, all right, back up an atom.
2903017	2905158	And I just hit start with it, how ending a continue.
2905638	2909419	And I was all the way back at the beginning and I was pissed.
2909599	2911400	And I was like, well, video's done.
2912200	2915000	And you might be thinking, Rob, why don't you just use a save state?
2915361	2916561	Why don't you just rewind?
2917481	2920362	Because my ego...
2922080	2949625	when we talk about using retro achievements has to use something called hardcore mode where those features are not available and if you turn hardcore mode on those features are not available and so those features were not available now do I need to go back and maybe turn that off and try Super Mario again yes perhaps I will humble myself a little bit and perhaps that is how we will do the game next time um
2950836	2951636	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2976266	2977246	DeathWarp DeathWarp
2997592	3005995	and there is another tunnel all the way up to the right and you basically just have to use the respawning block trick to get all the way to the top.
3006155	3008376	That's how you're like supposed to do it.
3010236	3018559	But despite those problems and then dying once at Mother Brain, actually I died twice at Mother Brain, but despite all this, I beat the game.
3018739	3024301	I beat the game in one stream and it actually clocked in at under three hours, which means I got swimsuit Samus.
3025385	3027926	Now, I got one-piece swimsuit Samus.
3028387	3034229	You actually have to beat the game in under an hour to get two-piece bikini Samus.
3034830	3039752	So, at some point, I will need to go back and try harder to beat the game in under an hour.
3040112	3045715	But now that I know better some of the pathing, I really should have gotten the Screw Attack a lot sooner.
3045975	3049257	Because I only used a Nintendo Power kind of map.
3049617	3070727	I did not use like an entire guide or anything to sort of like tell me what to get when and all that I was just kind of like went based off muscle memory and I really should have got the screw attack when I got the high jump boots and I think if I'd done that it probably would have gone a little smoother for me um and now that I know I don't have to death port in once I beat Kraid that'll make it easier too so I might actually try it again sometime we'll see
3072091	3076015	Yeah, Tiger Claw says the Justin Bailey code unlocks Swimsuit Samus and all the power-ups and weapons.
3076415	3083744	I do know that, and that is something I guess I could use, but I think to get that... I don't know who doesn't know that.
3084204	3089731	To get the actual achievement in Retro Achievements, I think you have to do it without passcodes.
3091075	3093316	I think the achievement actually locks out passcodes.
3093336	3095997	You have to play it basically in one sitting or with save states.
3096597	3098238	So anyway, original Metroid.
3098938	3102059	That was really cool that like I could still beat it in under three hours.
3102099	3108942	I kind of wasn't expecting to get the next, you know, I think there's four different endings and I would have gotten the second best one.
3109022	3110222	So that was kind of surprising to me.
3110322	3111143	So I was like, okay, cool.
3111163	3111543	I'll take it.
3112850	3116394	It wasn't a 100% run either, but not far off.
3116454	3118396	I think I had 215 missiles.
3119177	3120999	So I think I collected most missiles.
3122601	3122861	All right.
3122921	3127366	Anyway, let's move on and we're going to talk about other things going on in gaming news.
3127466	3129188	We're going to kick it over to Loki.
3130515	3130875	All right.
3132615	3139757	So we saw this article with Shawn Layden talking about the collapse of the game industry.
3140597	3145518	Shawn Layden, for those who don't remember, is the former SIE Worldwide Studios chairman.
3146618	3153300	And, you know, of course, working with Sony as part of their PlayStation brand.
3154692	3173219	and uh based off the article in Game Industry Biz uh said you know if we're going to rely or if we're just going to rely on blockbusters to get us through I think that's a death sentence um basically saying that you know there's a large cost to making these blockbuster games and if they don't
3174181	3177803	Succeed, then you're going to lose a ton of revenue.
3178264	3191192	So you're looking at sequels, you're looking at copycats because the finance guy who draws the line says, well, if Fortnite made this much money in the amount of time, my Fortnite knockoff can make this much money in that amount of time.
3191632	3200718	And we're seeing a collapse of creativity in games with studio consolidation and the high cost of production.
3201478	3210047	A lot of the focus seems to be on how we're monetizing a game versus what is the game going to be and how is it unique and how is it going to draw players.
3210968	3212629	He says it's plateaued.
3212669	3215052	We're at a stage of hardware development that I call
3216713	3218214	Only dogs can hear the difference.
3218254	3223837	If you're playing your game and the sunlight is coming through your window on your TV, you're not going to see any ray tracing.
3223857	3225157	It has to be super optimal.
3225177	3228919	You're going to have to have an 8K monitor in a dark room to see these things.
3229460	3242546	And I kind of agree, especially when we were seeing the side-by-side comparison with the PlayStation 5 and the PlayStation 5 Pro, it was pretty hard to see the difference.
3242626	3246028	If they didn't zoom in to point out what the differences were,
3247685	3272189	it's almost undiscernible at that point um and yeah i mean i think that we could be you know a lot of this lack of innovating is hurting the industry i mean we just saw that with um you know some of the games coming out from these different uh publishers you know sony just had a massive flop on their hands um
3273911	3278495	Yeah, I think they do have to innovate, and that's why some of these indies are doing really well as well.
3280717	3291045	Questbuster in chat says, to add to this, Layden was also quoted at another event from a few months ago for saying that the rising cost of AAA games was becoming unsustainable.
3291065	3291946	Yeah.
3292467	3294228	ZenMonkey says, yeah, gaming is cooked.
3294308	3295529	They need to do something new.
3297251	3299532	It's a really tricky sort of dance, isn't it?
3299593	3300093	Because...
3302013	3318787	for sure like I was gonna say like I think the hard part about it is the fact that they're just trying to justify more expensive games and they're trying to do it in a sense it's almost like in a bubble like yes I understand that better visuals may take more time to develop and stuff like that
3320029	3345889	but at the same time when you're raising the price of your game then the expectation of those games rises as well and I gotta say like whether even games are $69 or $59 to release a game and then have it be in such a state that you have to release your roadmap on how you're going to fix the game that's unacceptable at any price point I believe like unless it's a free-to-play game
3346952	3376318	it's not really like you're basically saying hey yeah we know we released it in this broken state and your finished game may never come to you like you may never get a working version of the game depends on how much we sell it and honestly like then put your game in early access then if you know the game is in this state then release the game as early access make it very upfront saying hey we know that we messed up because a lot of times they try to pretend and they try to hide it and then on top of that that's assuming that in a bubble that you know
3377386	3378127	Thanks for watching!
3397628	3398089	DarkSakura.com
3409028	3413070	Better at all than something that came before it for a quarter of the price.
3413791	3415172	It's just it doesn't make sense.
3416473	3425658	You know, I think there's like one quote from Sean Layden in this whole piece that I'm like, yes, this because I feel like we have been saying that on this program for quite some time.
3426158	3426639	It's this.
3427279	3433183	Well, if Fortnite made this much money in this amount of time, my Fortnite knockoff can make this in that amount of time.
3434039	3434479	No, it can't.
3434739	3435160	No, it can't.
3436260	3440662	You cannot force something to go viral in the way that certain games do.
3440763	3447526	It's like people that think, oh, if I do this certain dance on TikTok that's very popular right now, I'm going to get all these followers and all this stuff.
3448246	3454870	That sort of community is a very hard thing to grow organically and you're not going to do it from ripping someone else off.
3455310	3462474	And in a way, the gaming industry is almost a victim of its own success because the problem is Fortnite doesn't fucking end.
3464145	3488670	especially like Battle Royale in particular because now we could also go down the road that Fortnite is actually a platform at this point that now there's other games in that so that you are still always playing the Fortnite ecosystem you are always playing that and once again like just because you clone something doesn't mean it's going to be successful because once again like why would I play your clone when I can play the real thing
3489758	3491980	for, you know, essentially cheaper.
3492040	3494441	Like, you know, perfect example, Fortnite and Concord.
3495722	3498304	I mean, Concord's more of a hero shooter, so Overwatch, I guess.
3498985	3501927	So Overwatch 2, you know, free to play game.
3503408	3517858	I could play that, or you want me to pay into this thing that is not even finished, and then you pull the plug on it a week later, because it was clearly, you know, everyone was telling you this doesn't look good.
3518319	3547360	and you're like nope full speed ahead you know we didn't learn anything we're just charging forward we're gonna make as much money off this as we can and hope for the best and it's just like didn't you do any market research like what kind of market research did you do beforehand like do you not have people telling you like that yeah because this is popular doesn't mean that you're going to make something equally popular you have to have a unique take on it that draws in players if you just go yeah we're doing what they do but maybe not as good
3548934	3549794	No one's going to buy it.
3551475	3554375	I'm going to a chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
3554695	3562496	SGO100Matt says, instead of trying to make the next blockbuster game clone based off a successful indie title, maybe take chances and support these indie titles.
3562877	3566537	Yeah, there are, you know, again, it's the diamond in the rough.
3566637	3569198	It's that random thing that goes viral on TikTok.
3569658	3573838	But, you know, there are a lot of indie games that really do take over the industry, right?
3573878	3575279	Among Us is a great example.
3575439	3577099	And not even necessarily indie games.
3577719	3604241	yeah like look at look at like just for example let's just take um what Sony's done recently so Sony released Astro Bot and you look at their platform like look at the Sony PlayStation 5 what is it lacking it's lacking a lot of those family-friendly platformer games that you can find on like say the Switch and stuff you know back in the PlayStation 2 era you had a lot of those Jack and Daxter um Ratchet and Clank you know that type of stuff
3605261	3633683	even I guess even going back to oh gosh Crash Bandicoot stuff like that and now you don't really have a lot of those and so when you have this title come in that's extremely polished and it fills that void that was on your platform like that's what makes a successful game something that people are craving for if you just give them hey here's another hero shooter you know looter game you know
3633903	3634564	There you go.
3636006	3638109	That will continue to take your money.
3638149	3639351	Which I think is very important too.
3639891	3642174	Astro Bot does not continue to take your money.
3642675	3642875	Right.
3643076	3644277	Concord was set up to do that.
3645120	3672061	so so it's it's just like you put it out there and it fills a void and something people were looking for and not only that it strengthens your platform altogether because now you have something you know whereas if I was looking for a specific console like say I didn't have any consoles and it's like well man I really like platformer games well Switch has a lot of those and uh well PlayStation doesn't really have a lot of those and Xbox doesn't really have a lot of those so I guess I'm buying a Switch you know it
3672641	3674182	It helps drive that.
3674723	3677685	So I don't know why they wouldn't look at that.
3677925	3681228	And I understand that there's certain... I mean, it's about money.
3681268	3683609	They look at how much money this made.
3684510	3685851	I want to make that kind of money.
3685971	3687592	And so they try to copy it and...
3688433	3689634	Yeah, and some businesses that works.
3689654	3690294	Look at YouTube.
3690414	3695017	I mean, copying other people works just fine, and there's no repercussions for that.
3695497	3709925	So it's hard to say, but when we're talking about a billion-dollar, many-billion-dollar industry, trillion-dollar industry probably at this point, yeah, you can't be doing that anymore.
3710740	3711661	I'm looking at some other comments.
3711701	3720027	QuestBuster says, to build on what Rob has said, that's what Ubisoft has been trying to do for the past few years, chasing trends in the hopes that they can replicate the same success of their rivals.
3720348	3723310	Well, that's why Ubisoft is – we've talked about this before.
3723350	3736841	It's a horribly mismanaged company, and Ubisoft really deserves to – I hate to say it because there's a lot of hardworking people on the front lines of Ubisoft, but the problem is when your CEO is also part owner –
3737895	3738775	What are you going to be able to do?
3739315	3742456	Anyway, we have more coming up on Ubisoft later, so I don't want to get too far into it.
3743136	3750977	Yes, Ubisoft is a problem, and the problem is the CEO who's chasing this bullshit and is getting exactly what he deserves in that sense.
3750997	3754398	What's funny there is they're competing with themselves and they're losing.
3754458	3755338	How do you do that?
3755558	3761179	They put out a game that had pirate ships in it and piracy, and it's worse than their new pirate game.
3761679	3762580	How do you do that?
3762740	3764420	You've got the mechanics, just...
3765120	3767101	Bring that into a new game and make it better.
3767181	3769661	Why are you just like, oh, hold on, let's ruin it all too.
3769761	3772242	Like, it doesn't make any sense.
3772602	3773482	Yeah, that's for sure.
3774523	3776663	ZenMonkey11 says you have to fault gamers too.
3776703	3781725	There was a time that they tried new stuff and gamers shat on it saying they wanted sequels and remakes.
3783086	3801792	well yeah but you know no no like they want to blame the industry they want to blame the gamers and I get it that they go with trends but also they try to drive trends because if it was just what gamers wanted then we probably wouldn't be complaining because we'd be getting what we wanted it's not that it is just uh
3802518	3806379	And it could be that they even try different things, but those different things are awful.
3806479	3814962	Like, for example, it's not really different, but Suicide Squad, they tried something different than what they normally were making, and it was awful.
3815542	3816862	So, I don't know.
3816962	3818463	I hate to blame...
3820204	3821486	It's the consumer that's wrong.
3821826	3822788	No, it's not.
3823088	3826553	The consumer is right in the sense that they know what they want.
3826813	3830238	They put a lot of bullshit in Suicide Squad I didn't need, too.
3830278	3832240	Forever making money.
3832260	3836887	To say that phrase properly, the customer is always right in matters of taste.
3837802	3849134	Right, and what I'm trying to say, not necessarily that they only want sequels, but it's more like we want that good thing that was in this game, and we want that to be in other games, but also make it better.
3849474	3853418	Not, hey, we just want 50 sequels for this game, like Assassin's Creed.
3853458	3853699	We don't...
3855220	3863689	We like the original Assassin's Creed or the few original games, but we think that would be really cool in this setting.
3864009	3869655	But instead, they're like, okay, and we're going to add mythological creatures and magic and all sorts of other nonsense.
3870116	3872938	It's like, well, no, I don't want that.
3873159	3873259	Yeah.
3874121	3877064	I don't like that part.
3878405	3879406	I like Saints Row.
3879526	3894958	I like the original Saints Row, a couple of games, but then when it started getting too stupid, I did like that because I liked certain elements of the game, but that didn't mean that I wanted them to keep making sequels to the point where it was just a completely different game at that point.
3895178	3895318	Yeah.
3896076	3899777	Bonds006 with a great comment here in chat saying, we did not ask for NFT.
3900117	3901418	That's a great fucking point.
3901698	3907539	You know, a lot of times the industry is like shoving these things down our face that it just says, well, this is what the consumers told us.
3907799	3908980	No, nobody fucking told you that.
3909560	3910500	Analysts told you that.
3910680	3912741	Money motivated people told you that.
3913081	3917802	Nobody actually playing the video games told you they wanted to go spend more money on this meaningless shit.
3918402	3919502	and look at how well it went.
3919562	3934106	And now I would argue the same thing is starting to happen with AI to some extent because look, look at the backlash that X is getting now because of the AI picking up and all this stuff and now people are leaving for another social media platform.
3934426	3936607	How many people are fucking pissed off that Google
3937287	3965758	they didn't fucking ask for the AI results they just show up by default or Facebook when you go to say something like you know I want to find like it just like meta AI again in your fucking face I didn't fucking ask for the AI this is a big problem that I think a lot of people have and before you go labeling me anti anti AI I'm not because I understand that it has its usages in other places it's a good tool in some places it's a good conversation starter for lack of a better term
3966118	3985735	it's a good thing when that's the thing you want but I don't know who fucking told these game developers that like AI art and shit was stuff that we wanted to pay $70 for yeah well they're trying to instead of using it as a tool to aid yeah trying to use it as a replacement right
3986315	3988076	Yeah, they're trying to take the shortcut.
4006460	4009203	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4029844	4044000	AI is a tool for art AI is not a replacement for art there's a very clear difference between those two things and I think you are seeing the population is really starting to push back when you
4044781	4045781	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4063806	4064146	I don't wanna...
4092518	4108216	support this game in good faith only I want to make sure this is a polished game that has the value of $70 I want to get my hands on this game before I totally throw my weight behind it but if this is a polished product and a good game we need to support it
4109960	4121187	because Baldur's Gate 3 is an excellent example of that game did phenomenally well and a lot of it is because it gave gamers what they really want.
4121787	4135135	A good fucking story, a good experience, all in one package without any DLC, season pass, extra bullshit for the price they were asking for it and it was a great experience.
4136574	4160767	and if Expedition 33 is going to go along those same lines which god I hope it does then I and I hope it's good I hope it does successful because that's good if you want to show it's good if you want to show game developers I want more turn-based RPGs here you go hopefully it's got to be good it's got to be good before I can say you know I don't know yet I'm not going to base that off a trailer but hopefully it's good I'm rooting for it I really am so
4162372	4164014	Alright, let's move on.
4165136	4166357	Good topic though, good discussion.
4166397	4172766	Let's talk a little bit about what's going on at Riot because unfortunately it is some not so great news, I hate to say.
4172886	4176611	And that is that Riot unfortunately has done some more layoffs.
4177792	4183177	That happened this week where, and earlier this year, Riot already laid off a pretty significant number of people.
4184057	4193205	But this week, Riot laid off 32 employees, 27 of them active League of Legends developers and five more from the publishing division at Riot.
4194266	4200931	And of course, there was a statement talking about, it's making sure we have the right expertise so League continues to be great for another 15 years to be on.
4201171	4203433	This isn't about reducing headcount to save money.
4203793	4205755	We're not slowing down work on the game you love.
4206115	4211556	We're investing heavily in solving today's challenges faster while also building for the future.
4211716	4214977	I have no idea what the fuck that means.
4215437	4216637	What the fuck does that mean?
4219117	4224718	Anyway, that's just like... It means these are some words to distract so we don't actually have to answer the question.
4224838	4230619	This is me trying to make you feel better about these people's jobs by telling you don't worry, the game isn't going to suck.
4231019	4232860	That's all I'm getting out of that.
4233380	4234760	That says nothing about...
4237076	4239679	This isn't about reducing headcount to save money.
4241821	4243122	Then what the fuck was it?
4245565	4250430	The bullshit smell is so strong I can smell it all the way from LA.
4250750	4251991	And that's not just Koalinga.
4252372	4255375	I can smell it from this person's mouth all the way from LA where Riot is at.
4257597	4264079	Anyway, they are giving staff a six-month severance, so an annual bonus, health coverage, job placement assistance.
4264759	4270600	So, I mean, at least hooray to it being somewhat humane, but this is still very frustrating shit to hear about.
4272101	4273621	Riot, of course, League of Legends.
4274041	4284604	There is also an MMO they're apparently working on, but I guess the rumor is that things were reset on that because the MMO was feeling too much like League of Legends itself.
4285627	4290603	So I don't know how much that plays into this whole thing, but yeah, interesting.
4291462	4293103	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4321809	4325073	and all I'm going to say is roll up the windows and turn your air on circulate in your car.
4325113	4326235	There's a reason I take 99.
4327716	4334465	Yeah, or take 99, which unfortunately is a great option from Sacramento, not a great option from San Francisco.
4335666	4339111	So most people are stuck doing the five from SF or Bay Area in general.
4339878	4340818	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4362566	4365089	I know, I know, and I'm the worst at remembering.
4365129	4368693	So why don't we just go on to the present, the new, the shiny, DarkSakura, what's new and shiny this week?
4381124	4383666	So Unity has launched Unity 6.
4384447	4396757	So it has native Windows ARM support, which is, hey, ARM, you know, for people who work on tablet systems or might be emulating from a PC.
4399079	4400621	An Apple Silicon device.
4402202	4410949	But at any rate, the good thing about that is that it actually can run really well now on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
4413051	4415493	It's supposed to be...
4417134	4424758	Also coming with an updated AI library, which I mean, this is, I think, more of an assistive AI.
4424998	4428440	I'd have to look a little bit more into that, but it also has improved graphics performance.
4430501	4437444	And yeah, so this is basically the AI tool in here is for response from camera, microphone, and sensors in game.
4438545	4438685	And
4440262	4452196	you can also adjust the user interface it looks like a little bit more on the fly they allow you to use ProBuilder and Cinemachine and they are also
4454572	4458815	Putting in that arm support as well for people who use the Snapdragon X computers.
4459616	4461998	So I think this is going to be pretty good.
4462118	4466802	And for me, I've actually just started a development in Unity course myself.
4466922	4473087	So I'd really like to see if the course I'm taking actually starts moving on to doing their stuff for Unity 6.
4473147	4474108	I think that would be really cool.
4474649	4478312	But it also does offer...
4479933	4482934	A little bit more, of course, the better computer that you have.
4484455	4495980	They have compatibility with Maya, the Creative Cloud apps, but those, of course, do not run on Snapdragon X. So just a little quick one out there for our game dev friends.
4497081	4499362	and people who like making VTubers.
4499802	4503444	I know Unity had a lot of shit that was going on last year.
4503604	4513048	I think it is important to note because a lot of times we say it should be the people at the top that are the ones to pay the price for when things go wrong.
4513488	4514669	I will say this.
4514709	4523753	Again, everybody needs to make their own decision about what platform works for them, but if you look at who's running Unity now versus who was running Unity a year ago, it has changed nearly completely.
4525213	4525934	For what it's worth,
4527583	4530285	That's what we say ought to happen in those types of situations.
4530926	4531947	It has happened at Unity.
4532248	4539916	So maybe if that helps clear up some of the issues you were having with Unity, I think it might be worth looking into.
4541049	4546135	So and I think it's on us to let you know about those types of things, too, because we ask for those things.
4546376	4548158	And I don't think that has been very well reported.
4548498	4550280	I know it was reported John Riccatello left.
4550340	4554666	I'm not sure it's been reported that 90% of the rest of the higher ups also have moved on.
4555166	4557930	So worth considering.
4558430	4558851	All right, Loki.
4560922	4561342	All right.
4562843	4568267	So we've got some more games coming to Game Pass, and these are Activision games.
4569287	4571489	So Activision games coming.
4571729	4575291	We've got actually some pretty big ones, actually.
4575872	4577133	The Call of Duty games.
4578414	4593707	StarCraft and of course South Park as well we're getting some games there so South Park the Fractured But Whole coming to Game Pass actually already came to Game Pass Donut Country and Ashen those are all out this month
4594608	4600210	and then that's for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, so basically console and PC.
4600951	4609855	On the PC side and Ultimate, we've got MechWarrior 5 Clans, Call of Duty Black Ops 6,
4611075	4633563	Dead Island 2, StarCraft Remastered, and StarCraft 2 Campaign Collection and those are going to be out between now and November 5th and then for Game Pass Ultimate on console only we have Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 on the cloud and then of course Call of Duty Warzone also on the cloud those are both on the 25th
4637285	4638366	Lots and lots of things.
4638466	4643029	Well, yeah, they need to be adding stuff to Game Pass because they've been taking a lot out of there.
4643049	4644170	And you know what else they're taking out?
4644410	4645231	The dollar trial.
4645491	4649174	I think that was reported on before, but it's... I think they've done that before, though.
4649434	4658861	But it's going away, so, you know, if you... But, I mean, there's so many ways to, like, get trials of Game Pass, but they are going to make it harder with some of their big, big, big games coming to it.
4658961	4660322	So, you know, just...
4661022	4688367	just sign up for a month cancel it right away so it doesn't renew and then see if you like it and judge from there that would be what I would suggest if you're trying to test the waters on that alright let's talk about a game that I think would do very well on Game Pass but even without Game Pass I think a lot of people are going to be checking out Hades 2 when it eventually releases but right now it is still in early access and Hades 2 got a big major update this week
4688947	4692450	Supergiant Games is calling this the Olympic update.
4693231	4696074	Nice little pun intended with what the game is all about.
4696874	4700798	There is a new region with this that will be set, of course, in the mountains of Olympus.
4701238	4704041	And new story elements, which means hours of new dialogue.
4704301	4705962	There are also two new allies.
4706523	4710607	We don't know who they are, but we did see Ben Starr make a post on...
4711187	4712228	Hades 2 is one of them.
4726964	4745239	There also is going to be a new main weapon, two new animal companions, new cosmetic items, quality of life improvements, and DarkSakura max support natively for Hades 2 Early Access, as long as there is an Apple M1 chip or later required to run the game.
4745259	4745780	As it should be.
4746040	4748002	Yeah, so... They're basically new machines.
4748642	4749403	Newer Machines
4763718	4766560	People were, you know, the first Hades did very well.
4766960	4769441	This second one, I've played it.
4769561	4770022	It's great.
4770102	4771662	If you like the first one, you're going to love this one.
4773143	4777205	And I think it's going to also do very well when it ultimately finally releases in its final form too.
4777906	4780227	And maybe, maybe they're onto something over a super giant.
4780387	4780727	I don't know.
4781368	4782949	But props to them for that.
4783689	4789113	Doing this the right way, you know, or I don't know if I should say early access is the right way.
4789553	4793696	But, you know, if you're going to put a half-baked product out there, then yes, early access is the right way.
4794516	4797558	If you're going to fully bake it and then release it, just make sure it's fully baked.
4799139	4801441	Yeah, and that Apple logo is on there officially now.
4801681	4801841	Yep.
4802722	4803302	So there you go.
4803462	4803763	Yep.
4803803	4804043	Cool.
4804950	4808694	As Joan Hunter-Matt says, the thirst will be real when Ben Starr's character is revealed.
4808834	4813479	It's already been revealed, but I don't know if we know what the name is yet.
4813539	4821367	But there's some concept art and stuff over on The Bad Place where most, to be fair, most celebrities and voice actors are still maintaining a presence, at least for now.
4822878	4824780	Alright, well, let's move on.
4825301	4832991	Loki, or sorry, no, we're to DarkSakura because, sorry, I think you're actually going to follow up on something we started to get into earlier.
4833131	4835394	And then I said, well, let's hold that thought for a minute.
4836343	4837963	So it's about striking.
4839484	4844905	And there is a French Game Workers Union called STJV.
4845145	4861989	It's Syndicat de Travail et Travail de Jeu Video, which just translates to Video Game Workers Union, have stated that they have walked out on a three-day strike.
4862309	4863449	700 Ubisoft France workers.
4864730	4869988	Um, and they said that, you know, they had, uh,
4871647	4879553	called the strike when Ubisoft management did not respond to their complaints that they be in the office at least three days a week.
4879733	4882275	They said that, which is actually kind of funny.
4884957	4886018	That's funny on a personal level.
4886038	4886759	I'll go to that later.
4887239	4896466	But anyway, they told the French press that the company had reneged on promises for homeworking
4897767	4901990	and quote, calls into question the way they organize their lives.
4902570	4903030	Interesting.
4903790	4915577	So they thought that, Ubisoft that is, thought that they thought a three-day requirement would boost creativity and teamwork and still respect individual circumstances.
4916337	4937983	sounds a lot like something that my work said um but this was the workers clearly disagreed um and of course you know they're still dealing with uh with the fallout from the the stock drop and everything so now to add to this Ubisoft Milan has joined in for one day um
4939352	4947275	with one of their union leads saying that it is not economically sustainable and it's unfair on a human level.
4948035	4954177	So their branch of Fion's, is it Sigil Union?
4955397	4956618	Also are pretty much...
4958660	4961784	I'll just read the quote on here to add to that.
4961984	4962125	So, um...
4975512	4979737	Yeah, they are really pushing for that.
4979797	4984903	The other thing, too, is another quote from the STJV group.
4985804	4994555	The consequence of this decision will be the loss of our colleagues' jobs, the disorganization of many game projects, and the drastic increase in psychological risk for those who remain.
4997048	5006754	So there is so much going on, not to mention a class action lawsuit as well for sharing customer data on meta.
5008775	5010897	Yeah, that's a new one too.
5011477	5016300	So yay, the lawsuit was filed on October 3rd.
5017581	5021423	I feel like the tide against Yves Guillemin, it just gets bigger and bigger.
5021903	5023524	And I'm sorry, not sorry.
5023564	5024225	You love to see it.
5025751	5026171	Um, yeah.
5055453	5080573	and there really isn't a comment from Ubisoft yet so we'll see all right stay tuned yep all right now we can go over to Loki for our next story Loki oh SSJ100 Matt says it great when asked for comment Eve Skimmel said wait I'm supposed to care about how my employees feel how does one do that kind of an important part of taking on that role all right Loki what do you have for us
5082176	5087098	Another console that we're probably not going to be able to buy because it'll be sold out, I'm guessing, since it is analog.
5087478	5092159	Analog 3D is a brand new console that they are producing for $250.
5092299	5096321	It is an FPGA Nintendo 64.
5097701	5102803	And, of course, it has all the bells and whistles that we expect with an analog console.
5102863	5103643	4K output.
5104103	5106724	Also couldn't do the standard.
5107204	5109645	I think it can also do composite as well.
5110665	5134732	um but yes it's it's got a fancy a wireless controller as well which unfortunately doesn't retain the original look of the um Nintendo 64 but a little bit more like I'd say the GameCube if you know the GameCube were just a ripoff of the Xbox 360 controller but um you know a little bit more modern
5135559	5141763	And yeah, those are going to be, it's pre-orders are going to be starting tomorrow, October 21st.
5141803	5146406	And they're going to go faster than Taylor Swift or Beyonce tickets.
5146546	5147247	They will be gone instantly.
5147267	5150469	They are going to start shipping first quarter of 2025.
5151029	5154131	Be available in black or white.
5154292	5158454	But I think that's just going to be not available because good luck.
5158654	5160115	May the odds be ever in your favor.
5161376	5161656	Mm hmm.
5162037	5162277	Mm hmm.
5163852	5164112	All right.
5164132	5168334	Well, I think it's neat, though, that we're starting to see the hardware for this stuff pop up.
5168394	5171975	And I'm sure Analog is not going to be the only one that puts out something in 64.
5172655	5175676	We'll kind of start to see more as the hardware patents expire.
5175696	5178377	We're going to see more companies kind of doing their own versions of this.
5178417	5184719	So it'll be interesting to see what all comes out with that for people that love to enjoy retro stuff like me.
5186841	5191403	Alright, speaking of retro things, and unfortunately this is a little bit of sad news.
5191423	5196585	We kind of knew it was coming, but it's still a little sad to hear it as definitively as this.
5197126	5204709	But Nobuo Uematsu has announced that he is retiring from composing video game music as in he's done.
5204829	5209031	Like, Fantasian Neo Dimension is his final project.
5209251	5209831	Done, done, done.
5210271	5211112	Now, it was...
5212132	5216337	Later clarified and amended to basically be on social media.
5216898	5223486	Uematsu went and actually said, not like retiring completely, but I will not be doing any more full soundtracks.
5223546	5229453	He says, I'm going to cut back a bit on my video game music work because I want to have more time to make the music I want to make.
5230054	5258861	it would be difficult for me to take on the entire soundtrack of a video game because the time commitment for composing would be too long but I would like to continue work on jobs such as one theme song so I kind of take that to mean he'll probably still contribute to future Final Fantasy games whether they be 14 expansions or the inevitable Final Fantasy 17 whenever they're ready to reveal that I would assume he will still be working on those and perhaps other role playing games where he'll contribute one song but he's done
5259381	5287571	and honestly when you think about everything the man's given to our childhoods and the games we love and enjoy let the man enjoy his fucking retirement yes yes it's sad news but he earned it let him enjoy his I don't think it's sad I'm happy for him he's leaving us with a wonderful body of work and he gets to chill that's right well and I thought what was actually the most and I don't know if this is a translation issue or what so I'm trying not to read too much into this but he says I'm gonna cut back on my video game work because I want to have more time to make the music I want to make
5288231	5308096	and so I wonder if he isn't expanding and he's going to make like an album that just has nothing to do with games that's like whether it's a pop album or a classic album he's going solo Rob yeah I mean like he's just making a different it sounds like he might release a CD of some sort that is music or he's just making music to make music
5308816	5319004	or maybe he's going to make music that nobody's ever going to hear I make a bunch of music that no one ever hears and I have no intention of putting out an album or anything it's just fun to make music
5320554	5322096	Although I am working on something for us.
5322476	5324158	Bobby Blackwell says metal album.
5324198	5324899	He's a metalhead.
5324979	5326000	Hey, you never know.
5326280	5327882	Garth Brooks did that rock album.
5328202	5331746	There's that whole thing about Mariah Carey apparently had a Grunge Girl album in the 90s.
5331786	5332607	It was never released.
5333087	5336010	So you never know.
5336190	5337251	You never know what will happen.
5337852	5338573	Oh, you know what?
5339093	5341335	D'Artagnan says he was part of the Black Mages.
5342156	5342877	That was that.
5343217	5344858	So yeah, you're right.
5345078	5346619	He really is maybe a metal guy.
5346639	5348020	Maybe he's going to make something like that.
5348060	5348400	Who knows?
5348460	5348760	Who knows?
5349881	5353303	But at the same time, he doesn't owe you anything at the end of the day.
5354344	5357025	So we'll wish him a happy retirement and have that be that.
5357305	5361968	But yeah, Fantasian, the new one coming out to a lot more consoles.
5362649	5367752	I'm assuming they have changed the touch mechanic to something a little different to make that work.
5368112	5369813	But I'm excited to check it out.
5370934	5371154	All right.
5371912	5377306	Well, I guess this makes a good segue to talking about our classic game of the week.
5377446	5378388	So let's roll the bumper.
5389235	5396523	and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5396984	5399606	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5400447	5401769	Is it a classic though?
5402510	5403551	DarkSakura?
5404131	5406093	It's a game that people should be aware of.
5406214	5407235	Okay, alright.
5407275	5408256	What is the classic of the week?
5408715	5414639	For the record, the Mariah Carey album was one she sung backup on and it was by a band called Chick and called Someone's Ugly Daughter.
5415340	5417662	Okay, I knew it existed, but anyway.
5418162	5421044	And one of the copies that exists out there is selling for $300.
5422285	5422605	Wow.
5423486	5425267	Yeah, because I looked this shit up.
5425788	5434875	Anyway, the game is called Superman The New Superman Adventures or as we all know it, Superman 64.
5437016	5437937	Hot garbage, right?
5438723	5439023	Right.
5440044	5456633	But it's worth saying something about because this game has been so ingrained as what a bad game is that it had to eventually show up on the list, right?
5456653	5456733	Yeah.
5457739	5466483	So anyway, it's an action-adventure game that was published by Titus Interactive for Nintendo 64 that was based off of the Superman the Animated Series.
5467804	5471346	It was released in North America on May 29, 1999, in Europe on July 23, and is the first 3D Superman game.
5471386	5471486	So...
5478800	5506028	it is a game where everyone is trapped in this virtual environment and Superman has to go rescue his people so yeah it's got all kinds of the classic bad guys in it I'm not going to go into that but there was a lot of issues with its development a lot of restrictions being put on the developer and just DC and Warner Brothers having
5507674	5508616	having some crap.
5508676	5512182	And also an attempted remake of it to make it better.
5513004	5515909	So... Anyway...
5518223	5543759	you have to go and do these different tasks and go through puzzles and he can walk and fly and punch and do all of this stuff but apparently his powers are supposed to be super diminished in this world I'll get into that later so there are if you attack a civilian character or do uh
5544942	5549524	You lose all your health points or different things go on.
5549564	5552826	You can lose a level and it just says Lex wins.
5554407	5557288	But there are 14 levels with outdoor and indoor environments.
5557408	5560530	You've got combat and exploration, battling villains.
5561850	5565172	And then you've got three difficulty levels, easy, normal, and Superman.
5565812	5570475	So in easy mode, you don't need to fly through rings during ride stages.
5571155	5591982	apparently there's some stuff of that but there's also multiplayer modes where there's a racing mode and a battle mode that can play up to four people and you have to defeat your opponents by throwing weapons and items at them and then in racing modes you control a spaceship while rings are shot at your opponents
5592921	5611031	so yeah not great anyway um so Eric Kane who is one of the founders of Titus Interactive uh got the rights uh from Warner Brothers licensing to do a Superman game during the animated series era and so um when uh
5612586	5617368	When he learned about it, he got the license and no other company was really into it.
5618168	5625172	And he said that Warner Brothers asked him three times if he was sure of what he was doing.
5625572	5632675	So he signed a license deal in 97 with Warner Brothers to develop the game, to do it for Nintendo 64, PlayStation, and Game Boy.
5634330	5639114	and each port consisted of two programmers and six to nine artists.
5640135	5643938	The Game Boy version was completed and released by the end of that year.
5644638	5648361	The Nintendo 64 version development lasted for two years.
5648522	5650643	They wanted it to be more like a
5651664	5659806	Tomb Raider, 3D open world type of thing, real-time strategy, and behave like a superhero.
5659906	5669208	And he said, and this is a quote, it would stretch the Nintendo 64 to its limits, feature Superman's ability to fly and fight and include all of the superpowers.
5669288	5670649	But it was a little bit too ambitious.
5671609	5675910	So only about 10% of the original design made it into the final game.
5677491	5698593	and then after the deal was finalized where the Warner Brothers licensing went through a bit of a change the group turned on Titus in the project and tried to halt its development so they wanted to turn it into a SimCity style game where he acts as the Superman acts as the mayor and yeah and
5699660	5715155	and basically there's just a lot of back and forth and wanting to make changes and then finally there were some changes that was made so that the character would be portrayed positively
5716178	5719520	by limiting his power and removing destructible architecture.
5719720	5724844	And then that's why they put it in the virtual world to prevent from harming, quote, real people.
5726025	5730708	The rings were meant to be tutorials, but they ended up being a permanent part of the game.
5732449	5736391	And it was just taking months and months to get characters approved.
5737652	5744136	Not being able to address bugs because they really couldn't test anything because they didn't have characters
5747639	5772277	they couldn't actually get characters approved so they couldn't incorporate more of the work into it so it was showcased at E3 in 97, 98 and 99 and there were even then publications were calling it Superman 64 since 1997's coverage they didn't really talk about the virtual world in there they
5773258	5783713	were going into a few misrepresenting what the story was, highlighting powers that really were more of a minor.
5784615	5787519	And a lot of people were saying that the game looked...
5789163	5803159	for a fan the game looked great but for anybody else the game looked really bad some people said that the 3D environments were stunning and the fight levels were great but it got delayed after 1997
5805340	5813303	In March 98, it was about 85-95% complete, but there were further delays after criticism at E3.
5815223	5825226	On August 24, the character models and map sheets were released, and GamePro said that it was a showstopper and looked good.
5826209	5837673	but keep going further you know there was a lot of enthusiasm for the game they really just tried to put out like the best there was of it and it was even some people said it would elevate the Nintendo 64 even more
5841145	5857222	um but now if we fast forward quite a bit we have a scheduled release for November 16th 1988 that was announced in a press release with a huge promotional campaign and it was one of only five Nintendo 64 games shown at the 1999 Tokyo Game Show but um
5862543	5863304	Yeah, failure.
5863784	5864144	It failed.
5864605	5865225	It was not good.
5865426	5866086	It was not great.
5866326	5869169	It had lots of bad stuff going on.
5869289	5879498	However, Titus did entrust Blue Sky Software to redesign the game for the PlayStation, and the game did get approval from Sony, but the Warner Bros.
5879538	5884262	license expired, and Titus couldn't get a new one, so the game was canceled in 2000.
5885403	5889626	So that basically, because of Warner Bros., the PlayStation version was killed.
5890984	5914735	however there was a game build that was dated June 22nd 2000 that did eventually get linked to MediaFire and there's also apparently still out there archived on Internet Archive so there you go maybe you can find it so anyway
5916716	5926565	it was a top seller in America the week of June 1999 in July of the same year it had become the third best-selling game from Nintendo 64 over 500,000 units were sold but
5932363	5937589	People were giving it some good feedback, but they were the target audience.
5938490	5946538	However, the contemporary critical reception of it, it was considered to be one of the worst games of all times.
5948239	5955526	In IGN, it was published that the game was executed so poorly that it would harm the character's reputation.
5956607	5960070	and that it had a rushed, careless feel to the game.
5961991	5965213	The controls were confusing and difficult to use.
5965513	5968635	It was just really not great.
5968655	5970737	There were foggy, empty levels.
5971297	5973118	The indoor levels seemed out of place.
5974079	5978822	We're talking like Next Generation gave it a 1 out of 5 stars as did Allgame.
5978922	5980643	EGM gave it an 8 out of 40.
5981824	5982685	It was 23% in game rankings.
5986487	6009412	N64 Magazine gave it a 14% uh yeah it just it was abysmal abysmal IGN gave it a 3.4 out of 10 so GameSpot 1.3 out of 10 Game Revolution gave it an F Game Informer 1.25 out of 10 so yeah it was panned this is not great
6010618	6019499	and so but I think it is oh also it tells a Guinness World Record for lowest rated superhero game of all time
6020506	6021267	How about that?
6021307	6022768	Is that in the 2025 edition, maybe?
6024929	6026010	This is 2017.
6028011	6041101	But at any rate, though, I think that this is another example of how other factors can go into the destruction of what could have been a decent game.
6041241	6047926	There were a lot of plans for it, but I think it's something that would have been worth holding off for a later-gen console.
6049526	6077675	and and maybe not doing it just because you had access to the franchise you know but Warner Brothers I think had a lot to do with its failure and I think that not all of the the blame needs to be put on Titus I think that it was a bunch of stuff that went on behind the backs of people that no one really knew about at the time and yeah that's the game
6078871	6106305	that is a game and I mean and you can see where like there could have been potential it could have been good you know but I understand that what those limitations probably did I mean I think also again it was really ambitious for what it was this is not the kind of game that would easily work on Nintendo 64 and that's it
6109664	6112767	Yeah, it kind of reminds me in some ways of E.T., how like if E.T.
6112787	6116209	had had more time to bake, there's actually a good game in there, right?
6116289	6117450	But it's just the nature of the rest production.
6117470	6117710	Yeah, but E.T.
6117730	6118170	didn't have...
6119161	6121942	The License Holder, like, working against the developer.
6121962	6122843	True, true, true.
6122943	6124624	It is a different scenario, but I don't know why.
6124664	6128646	I'm kind of like, I guess it's the whole, like, there's a good game in there somewhere element of it, you know?
6129406	6131907	So, all right, well, there it is, your classic?
6132428	6134849	No, it is a classic, but just- It's a classic.
6134869	6138431	It's a classic for different reasons than most classics here.
6138531	6140111	Superman64.
6141052	6144974	TigerClaw in chat asks, do you think we need a new Superman game?
6144994	6146354	The last one was on the Xbox 360.
6146394	6146495	Okay.
6148125	6148766	You want to know what?
6149326	6150967	I don't give two shits about Superman.
6152449	6154670	You know, a good game is a good game.
6155111	6156612	I'm not a DC fan.
6156812	6169021	Well, whether it's Superman or a legally distinct super person with a cape flying around, you know, type of thing, a good game is a good game.
6169942	6173044	I don't need it to be Superman as much as I need it to be good.
6173785	6176467	I think this is better served in the Injustice games.
6177762	6193511	yeah Injustice was kind of a fun series so I thought they were I liked the comics for Injustice those were pretty good yeah all right well let's continue on and talk about some other headlines quickly in a segment we call Rapid Fire News Loki what do you got for us
6194695	6204138	We've got some other superhero news talking about Spider-Man 2 coming to the PC very soon.
6204199	6212822	So January 2025 is coming to PC, and it will require a PlayStation Network login.
6213622	6215903	It's like they don't learn, do they?
6215923	6216703	Yeah.
6217850	6228659	Yeah, and rather quickly too, considering that the original game came out just 15 months ago, or 15 months from when it will be released on PC.
6229579	6236805	Along with that, Insomniac has confirmed that no plans for story DLC for the game as well.
6237306	6244251	So if you were expecting some expansion to the story, nah, they're working on Wolverine, so sorry.
6246073	6246213	And,
6247190	6252371	Out of nowhere, exciting news, a brand new Tron game, Tron Catalyst.
6252872	6265515	It's an isometric action game that was being shown by Devolver Digital's big fan games publishing label and looks pretty cool, actually.
6266895	6276498	It's apparently continuing the story of Arc Grid, which was introduced in the visual novel game Tron Identity.
6277930	6280211	Which I did not play, but it looks cool.
6281311	6286333	Yeah, the gaming, the kind of like action-y sequences in this game do look kind of interesting.
6287713	6288594	I'm kind of down.
6288734	6293295	It's not what I expected a Tron game to look like, but I'm kind of into it.
6293375	6294015	I could be into it.
6294696	6298517	So I do love me some Tron, as you see behind me every week when I do this show.
6298637	6302978	So I'm very worried about this upcoming movie, but I'm going to try.
6303539	6305859	I'm going to go in with an open mind.
6306019	6306660	Yes, I am.
6307797	6308478	I'm going to try.
6309538	6309799	All right.
6309819	6310559	We'll see how that goes.
6311360	6311680	All right.
6313161	6313701	Let's move on.
6313721	6314202	DarkSakura.
6315583	6321327	So Gamestone Quick has raised over $45,000 for hurricane relief.
6322207	6325930	And that is wonderful and heartwarming.
6325990	6328592	It's going to go directly to the disaster relief charity.
6331189	6359653	that is great I actually I did get to see one of the speedruns from this in full one of my friends loves GDQ and speedruns and always wants to like when we hang out wants to watch a speedrun or two which is fine we watched the one for the Nintendo World Championships game where the speedrunner they were playing all of the little mini games back to back to back to back and it took them about an hour and 15 minutes I think the part time was an hour and a half it took about an hour and 15 minutes to get through the whole thing
6359753	6361494	Skybills, according to Bobby.
6389629	6414111	which actually gives you more air and gets you further in that direction you have to do a dance between forward and backwards with the tilting to do better and I was like oh I just want to like but I don't want to be that guy like I want to send him a message and be like you can improve your excite bike times if you tilt forward as well as backwards but it's like don't be that guy don't be that guy oh I'm not so instead I'm saying it on my podcast where it'll never be heard by anyone
6415106	6443658	but Excitebike is a hard game and you know what, so is Ice Climber and to be able to clear some of those tasks in time is a very, very tricky skill so there's that alright anyway let's move on, we'll travel oh wait, no, just kidding I have the story to talk about this is interesting, now I don't y'all know how I feel about Kickstarters I don't like to talk about Kickstarters unless there's like a final project that is ready
6444218	6445278	This one's a little different.
6445358	6448439	I'm going to roll with it because they've already met their goal, which is nice.
6448839	6452441	A lot of our listeners have been talking about it, which tells me I should talk about it here.
6453061	6457562	And the original media holder is actually wanting to see this happen.
6457622	6463264	And it is EGM Media, who own the magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly and its entire archive.
6463664	6469966	They're going to be doing a book and digital archive project to honor the legacy of this print publication.
6471046	6472067	So they are...
6473800	6474881	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6493078	6494339	and the legacy of the magazine.
6494419	6495981	It will also have long form articles.
6496561	6497922	If you want to get it digitally, it's $15.
6498042	6500425	If you want to get a hardcover version, it's going to be $50.
6502046	6506530	There are also some other tiers that can get you additional things, which is kind of neat.
6507230	6511054	It did meet its goal already, and they're looking to have that delivered by February 2025.
6511114	6513316	So I'm sure there's people that are going to be all over that.
6513496	6515958	And yeah, you know, again,
6517796	6518797	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6532816	6533416	Although it helps.
6533897	6536878	The Guinness book feels like a magazine in many ways.
6536918	6537519	Yeah, it kind of does.
6537539	6539740	It really has that magazine look and feel.
6539780	6543782	And I don't know if that's just trying to get a younger audience or whatever because it is about games.
6544302	6547924	But I liked the Guinness book because it feels like a magazine.
6548324	6559651	And so I feel like, all right, if you want to show folks that there still is a demand there for print media from some of the people who really brought it to us for years and years, then maybe I ought to just shut up and back this thing, which I think I'm going to do, honestly.
6559811	6561552	I wouldn't mind the book, to be quite honest.
6561592	6562212	I think I'm going to do that.
6562372	6565075	Too bad they couldn't have done this with Game Informer.
6566897	6569099	They took the archives and they're like, bye-bye.
6569520	6578489	Well, and maybe we should show them it was a mistake, but not that I really want GameStop to... I don't know that I would have backed it if it was GameStop doing it.
6578870	6582533	If GameStop sold the rights to somebody else and they were doing it,
6583359	6584360	Then I'd feel differently.
6584880	6589262	Especially if that person was an employee of the magazine at one point.
6589702	6591944	And that's why there's a lot of things about this that I like.
6592144	6593825	Original creator is involved.
6595025	6598908	A lot of people that were involved are backing it, which I think is really neat.
6599088	6600889	So sure, why not?
6600989	6601469	I'll back it.
6602309	6608593	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some things you can back off the retail or digital shelf very soon.

6648150	6649750	Please don't be another King Kong game.
6650790	6661094	Isn't that the one, the big flop that's been being worked on for, I don't know, I guess it wouldn't be a flop unless it's already been, I thought there was a King Kong game recently that like looked horrific.
6662842	6675400	uh no not that one i don't i don't think it was that one um maybe just we need to stop using kong unless it is sandwiched by the words donkey country i think we need to start from the word kong
6676514	6700075	or it's referring to animal snack products no this doesn't look like this is not that other game this actually looks decent unfortunately unlike the movies in which the focus should be on the monster it's on people so take that as you will thank you for clearing it up nevertheless

7189300	7191181	But first, we have a headline from Loki.
7193021	7196783	Yeah, so apparently Tekken 8 had a...
7198864	7226423	a level that was supposed to be included in the $110 deluxe version of the game but it wasn't included in that instead the level was going to be sold for an additional $5 and so of course the community took that with you know they took it very well they praised you know Namco and Namco Bandai for you know
7227506	7228692	being strong and innovative.
7228793	7229376	No, of course not.
7229436	7229577	They...
7232213	7233854	Review Bomb the hell out of the game.
7234454	7245258	And as such, Bandai Namco has walked back the whole DLC and gave the players $5 worth of free Tekken coins.
7246559	7257323	It says, we apologize for not meeting the community's expectation for the playable character Year One Pass and the Gemaji Temple DLC release method.
7258722	7267704	After some thorough discussion, the feedback, the tech and project team has decided on the following measures and they released all that stuff.
7268085	7282468	So, yeah, it says that the playable character, a year one pass edition says that it will, pass owners will now have access to it instead of having to pay an additional $5 on top of the year one pass.
7283088	7284529	And on top of that, they're also going to give you $5
7286277	7305622	dollars in coins you know so that you have to buy more coins in order to get more things I'm sure so good on them but once again this goes back to the original discussion that we had with monetization in games and how it kind of ruins it yep yeah there you go
7307912	7320054	they weren't content on having a season pass they had to sell additional things on top of that stuff that would normally be included in the regular game this is what you get
7322110	7322971	Discord Discord.com
7344130	7345251	Discord, Final Fantasy XI
7357789	7380418	This and an interview with Famitsu where Discord creator Stanislav Vinshevisky I hope I said that right Discussed the origins of the platform saying that he played a lot of Final Fantasy XI And actually made a prototype to use while playing And I remember when Loki and I would play Final Fantasy XI I think Jamie did for a little bit too We were using Ventrilo to talk to each other, right?
7380438	7384220	Because there were these pay services you could use to talk to each other They were, you know
7385427	7387148	They worked at the time, but you had to pay for them.
7387589	7389310	People didn't really like that either.
7391531	7396955	But yeah, then he developed a prototype to Discord so that he and his friends could talk.
7397416	7408544	And then when he moved to California and joined GREE, the mobile game developer, he met Jason Citron and they actually fleshed out what Discord eventually became.
7409845	7417691	and, you know, throughout the interview, it was asked, why do you think that Discord is successful when Skype was already a thing at the time for voice chat?
7417751	7422414	I know a lot of us laugh at Skype now, but again, way back in the history of this show, we took calls via Skype.
7423275	7426337	That's, you know, before Skype just became basically what's Microsoft Teams today.
7427358	7430140	You know, we used to take calls on Skype and a lot of people use Skype to talk.
7432915	7437738	The creator said that it's probably the simplicity of Discord that made it so popular.
7438078	7442141	The vision was a, quote, living room where you can spend time with your friends.
7442641	7445183	I think that's what made Discord so special.
7445963	7453708	And if you are wondering, yes, Stanislav now plays Final Fantasy XIV and is currently underway playing Dawn Trail.
7455868	7459114	and probably using Discord to talk to his friends while he plays.
7459434	7461338	But that is just a lucky guess.
7461979	7462099	So.
7463497	7465117	DJ Ranma S says, still use Skype.
7465298	7467298	I thought Skype got folded into Microsoft Teams.
7467358	7468518	I didn't know that it was still a thing.
7468538	7469119	That's kind of cool.
7469879	7471739	I never did enjoy Skype.
7471759	7474280	Final Fantasy XI is still going on.
7474360	7474860	Yes, it is.
7474940	7475700	There's like private.
7476020	7489984	In fact, I found out through retro achievements about a big one called Horizon because somebody patched achievements into Final Fantasy XI, which you have to be playing on this Horizon server, which is the old Final Fantasy XIV, or excuse me, Final Fantasy XI.
7490584	7511853	meaning the cap is 75 there's no books so you have to party in Valkyrim Dunes it's the old school uh but I think that's because they stopped developing for the PlayStation 2 when all that extra shit came out so this is kind of frozen with the Chains of Barathea expansion because all the other stuff was after they stopped PS2 development so kind of interesting
7513783	7517244	but that is not one I'll be probably playing live anytime soon but also never say never.
7517684	7518344	Never say never.
7518524	7519745	I do miss 11 some days.
7519965	7520545	It's good times.
7522025	7526687	And DJ Ranma S says Skype for business that was rebranded into Microsoft Teams.
7527067	7527467	Gotcha.
7528787	7529087	All right.
7530648	7533649	That's it for our stories but we welcome your calls.
7533769	7536569	If you want to join our Discord server in the green room we can take calls.
7537470	7539590	We would usually go to the mailbag at this point.
7539630	7541391	I don't think there was anything in there, right?
7541991	7542231	No.
7542351	7542511	Yep.

7549458	7556224	Okay, I've decided during the show, and I hope my co-hosts will support me, I think we need to make an OLR account on Blue Sky.
7557184	7561828	If everybody is making their way to Blue Sky, people have a way to interact with us on Blue Sky.
7561868	7562349	What do y'all think?
7562509	7562809	I could've!
7562829	7563110	I could've!
7582887	7584808	Anyway, so we'll get on that.
7584848	7586989	I'll figure out how to do the domain verification.
7587029	7589851	I was trying to look that up when somebody else was talking.
7589911	7592933	It doesn't look, it looks, it looks simple enough that even I can do it.
7593453	7596595	So I'm hoping we will just be orange laundry.com on blue sky.
7597235	7598276	So, yeah.
7599520	7599800	I do not.
7599820	7600760	What?
7629311	7637895	SG100 Matt says blue sky question of the week you know you know we might don't threaten me with a good time
7639008	7641809	Alright, that is going to do it.
7642209	7643909	That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
7643949	7645310	Thank you all for listening to our show tonight.
7645330	7645990	We appreciate it.
7646350	7647250	Thank you for being here.
7647671	7651692	We'll be back in seven days to do it all over again just before we head into Halloween week.
7651812	7658794	I know it's going to be Halloween weekend for many of you because I know Rocky Horror for me is next weekend and a lot of people have Halloween parties and events.
7659174	7662055	My ballet studio is doing a time warp.
7662295	7663055	Oh, that's cute.
7663555	7666256	I opted not to participate because I like my Fridays.
7666704	7669707	Yeah, but Halloween being a Wednesday is just a really weird day this year.
7669827	7672350	So yeah, people are doing things on the weekend and stuff.
7672410	7673391	So yeah.
7674012	7676655	SGO100Matt says, slow news week, but finished usual time.
7676675	7679498	Well, DarkSakura had some stuff to say at the top of the show.
7680539	7680879	I did.
7682060	7682501	Did I not?
7682781	7683362	Yeah, no, you did.
7683502	7683762	You did.
7684483	7684703	All right.
7685063	7686605	Oh, happy early birthday, Mike Deft.
7686945	7689188	I hope you have a good time celebrating whatever it is you do.
7690168	7691069	Happy Birthday!
7715988	7733019	and I think I would actually I would be willing to have like one lane that is the full feed with repost and another one that's without that's why I need to force myself to use Blue Sky to manage multiple decks at once because then I can have the OLR deck in there too that might be something I do so we'll see we'll see
7733902	7736845	Alright, but thank you as always for listening to our show.
7736865	7737365	We appreciate it.
7737405	7740047	If you enjoyed what you heard here, tell a friend or two about the show.
7740087	7744771	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.
7745372	7749455	A nice rebleat or whatever it is you want about our show goes an awful long way.
7749776	7753879	A nice five-star review on iTunes, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you found this show.
7754240	7755300	We will take that as well.
7755461	7756161	Thank you very much.
7757542	7761326	Yes, SGO100Matt says register to vote and vote early if your state is letting you.
7761406	7762607	I think that is great advice.
7763307	7765409	Obviously, there's the big election everybody's talking about.
7765529	7772095	That is important, especially if you are in the state of Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, you know the ones.
7772475	7772735	But
7773456	7775737	Every election, don't forget, school board elections.
7775877	7776757	They're important too.
7777678	7778418	Always vote.
7778518	7778718	Yeah.
7779118	7782340	Know at least if the people are assholes or not.
7782900	7797406	Or, you know, like in the case of the mayor here locally, because I was like, I don't, to be honest, I didn't know much about the candidates, but I went onto the Facebook pages and all the worst people I know on Facebook are dunking, like are just going off on the comments on this one candidate.
7797686	7803048	So I said, oh, she must be the one I'm going to vote for them because all the, the enemy of, the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
7804091	7804651	Not always.
7805392	7806272	Not always, but in this case.
7806292	7807052	Do your research, people.
7807272	7808253	Not always, but in this case.
7810033	7816296	But I would also just like to point out that also be sure that you're voting for someone with a functional brain cell.
7817276	7818677	That is important.
7819417	7819917	Trust me.
7820578	7825920	As somebody who dated a politician, before I was with Alan, I was dating a politician.
7828002	7834224	and if there's one thing I learned from that whole experience, it is any idiot can run for office.
7834645	7835045	Anybody.
7835605	7837366	You can run for office.
7837426	7837986	You can do it.
7838046	7840207	We've already seen an idiot run for office.
7840627	7847049	Well, we're seeing it in real time certainly on a national scale but let me tell you, I definitely have seen it on a local scale
7848815	7849255	as well.
7849575	7851416	And let's just all be thankful he didn't win.
7852136	7852476	Anyway.
7852576	7852796	Yeah.
7853316	7858617	But he got more votes than anybody with his party had in the long very scary prospect.
7858737	7858977	Anyway.
7859697	7859957	Yeah.
7860997	7862698	Anybody can have office.
7862978	7863638	So, alright.
7865478	7867019	DarkSakura, let's get to your final thought.
7867059	7870679	I know you're gonna be trying to stream some Dead by Daylight, but maybe ultimately something else.
7870799	7872380	But do you have some final thoughts for us tonight?
7874040	7874140	Um...
7875854	7887496	just, no I don't have any thoughts, I just hope the game works alright, fingers and toes crossed for you alright, later taters bye Loki, that takes us to you, what is your final thought tonight?
7888905	7906516	um yeah it's just you know I'm busy on uh you know content creation stuff go like me or go follow me on blue sky if you don't I guess yeah there you go probably I think everybody that's listening does already I think yeah most people you never know it's hard to know who's out there on the podcast feed because uh you know we don't see them right in front of our face and
7907196	7935220	I beg for emails we don't always get them but I understand some of you are commuting or you're busy at work and all that stuff so it's fine but yes we appreciate follows there and all that good stuff let's see my final thought tonight is I have a very busy weekend next weekend with show hosting I was very happy to do a show last night Aurelio Voltaire was here and did an amazing job a lot of fun always puts on a fun show we had so many local artists that were also doing incredible jobs so it was called the Sinister Soiree because it's
7935680	7937141	Sinister Creature Compost Party was great.
7937161	7937761	I had a lot of fun.
7938021	7940203	We're doing some shows next weekend, including Cabaret Macabre.
7940603	7943164	We have some performers from Dragula, the Belay Brothers, Dragula.
7943184	7943785	They're going to be there.
7944125	7944685	Really excited.
7944765	7950708	And then Rocky Horror Picture Show is going to be here next Saturday.
7951729	7952549	Very excited about that.
7952649	7953270	It is sold out.
7953510	7954631	So if you don't have tickets, you can't come.
7954851	7955111	Sorry.
7955471	7955951	It's sold out.
7956051	7957332	You'll have to wait until February for the next show.
7957652	7958453	And yes, Fifth Dream.
7959193	7960714	He used to go by just Voltaire, but
7961274	7962635	due to reasons and things, etc.
7962675	7963575	He uses his full name.
7964896	7969078	And he taught me a mnemonic on how to say his name, which it's Aurelio.
7969419	7971640	So you just say Aurelio is how you say his name.
7971680	7975282	So Aurelio Valtere is his full name that he goes by now.
7975522	7976582	And yeah, great performer.
7977243	7977703	Great guy.
7977743	7980164	Happy that he came all the way out to little old Sacramento.
7981205	7981505	All right.
7982365	7983946	On that note, we're going to wrap it up.
