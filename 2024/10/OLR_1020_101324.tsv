9949	15012	With Airsack Boy's last numbered mainline console release, you have only but a few short weeks left to live.
15412	22696	LittleBigPlanet 1 was one of my first personal forays into YouTube content creation, and the videos are still accessible from 15 years ago.
23697	26618	Please allow me to take this moment of silence from my youth and naivete.
27779	30100	This is the weekly reminder that now you're older than you ever have been.
30361	35563	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about LittleBigPlanet 3 and the rest of the week's gaming news.
35603	37625	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
40174	43296	And now you're even older from when Jason started that intro.
43716	45717	I mean, hello, my friends out there on the internet.
45737	50519	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
50679	61325	It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again here with episode number 1020 of our show for tonight, October the 13th.
62245	63087	Hello, hello, how are you?
77222	77943	It is what it is.
79464	82347	I'm still dealing with the dermatitis.
82687	85910	Oh yeah, and that whole thing you talked about last week.
87071	90214	I spent a day not wearing my watch, which feels weird.
90314	92096	I rely on my Apple Watch for a lot of stuff.
92977	99783	But I think it was acting as a heat source because a lot of the bumps on my arm are going away.
101667	103829	Basically, I'm itchy wherever I'm warm.
104169	105049	You're reminding me.
105410	107651	I needed to check where I was at with my stand hours.
107792	109913	Ooh, I'm barely cutting it right now.
110173	113656	My Apple Watch is good for nagging me to get up off my ass, literally.
114397	116399	Well, I've been leaning back on ice packs.
117040	120164	I have used, I have prescription hydrocortisone.
120805	123368	I have this steroid cream.
124249	126892	And even a week later, I'm still dealing with it.
126932	129915	Although, you know, contact dermatitis can take a while.
129975	131217	It's a histamine reaction.
131277	132418	It's immunoresponse.
132579	132899	So...
134102	134822	It's still annoying.
134862	136183	I'm going to ballet tomorrow anyway.
136684	140146	Well, I'm glad you're at least improving from where you were at last week.
141026	141766	Yeah, it's a lot better.
142007	142987	Hardcore drugs.
143087	143507	No, I'm just kidding.
143728	145288	Well, it's not on my face anymore.
145489	148570	Now I'm just having to repair all the damage that it did to my face.
148830	152593	But I do, with your fake face, I do love your VTuber.
152633	155895	Your VTuber's in a very casual Halloween sort of outfit.
155995	157495	And I think I'm liking it.
157856	158196	It's cute.
159178	167200	I'm still working on the ferret body, so I just took off the ferret shading because there's a weird place where it cuts off on the arms.
167740	170040	But I'm getting into the spirit, you know.
170200	177422	It's not Friday, but it is the 13th, so in the spirit of things, I'm all skellified up.
177962	178822	Alright, perfect.
179042	181523	And if you are not here with us live, sorry about it.
182352	193160	All right, well, we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.
193220	201827	And when you're here live with us, you can chat along with us where Mike Deft came up with a new tagline for the show based on what we were saying, where every gamer has a voice and is old.
202868	203588	That is correct.
204329	207972	As 2100 Matt follows that up going, where we all belong in a museum.
208032	208912	Yes, yes.
210793	213534	We're the vintage podcast.
213574	214775	The best damn wine.
215335	216475	The best damn wine.
216855	219776	Meaning, wine, why?
219876	221957	Why won't Nintendo announce a new console?
222017	224738	Why can't I get a sequel to The Guardian Legend?
224818	225398	Why?
226098	229779	I tried to play, but my carpal tunnel kept me from playing.
231100	232700	Sorry, carpal tunnel syndrome.
233000	235801	Everyone has a carpal tunnel, but not everyone has the syndrome.
237321	237702	All right.
238082	238743	Yes, that's true.
238823	241766	Bobby Blackwell points out Nintendo did announce a new console.
241826	242307	They did.
242407	242788	They did.
242828	244089	We're going to talk about that in just a minute.
244129	247173	But first, we have to say hello to Tech Master Loki.
247193	248554	Who else is going to bring us the news about it?
248614	249075	Hi, Loki.
249776	250056	Hello.
250276	250857	How are you doing?
251558	251978	I'm pretty good.
252139	252359	Yeah.
252439	254281	Enjoying some racing games I see behind you.
254401	256424	Although that's that's a newer indie game, right?
257168	258168	Yeah, it's Victory Heat Rally.
258208	258748	That's it.
258808	259229	That's it.
260309	263950	Is that a game you've actually been playing or just one you're like, no, of course I don't play games.
264010	264750	We talk about this.
264990	265470	Yes, you do.
265951	268011	You play one game and a lot of it.
268131	268511	One game.
268731	269112	Yeah.
270692	273153	But I saw you put out a new video for fun.
273533	274273	It's all work.
274533	275633	I saw you put out a new video.
276794	277054	Yeah.
277234	277434	Yeah.
278646	279126	Yeah, I did.
279887	281847	It was on just a shop.
281927	283388	I was trying to kill time.
283808	287570	Well, not kill time, but I was trying to put an episode while I'm still working on other things.
287650	293693	So I have a major part of the park that's the theme park that I'm building is being worked on right now.
293753	297214	So I'm still not ready to put that out yet.
297254	300036	So in the meantime, I was bored, so I built a shop.
300436	302937	And so I put that out as an episode.
304898	307519	Yeah, just to reset that clock to keep my sanity.
307850	308671	No, that's okay.
308951	313977	It's probably good to put out the little filler content now and then between the big project that you're working on.
314237	315478	Out of curiosity, do you do shorts?
315698	316359	The YouTube shorts?
317260	322966	Not often, just because it's hard for me to keep stuff within that one minute time frame.
323086	326290	Now that they've extended it to three minutes, I will probably use it a lot more.
326310	327150	Oh, I didn't know that.
328192	334635	Yeah, it's either this week or soon that they're updating it to three minutes.
334655	335656	That's a game changer.
336256	340278	Yeah, so that'll help a lot because a lot of my time lapses fit within that time frame.
340598	344260	There's a lot more clips that I can fit within that time frame that'll be a lot easier.
344280	350564	It's trying to condense stuff down to one minute was just really hard on a lot of these builds and things.
350604	357227	It also makes it a lot easier to cross-promote and cross- post with other similar things like TikTok and Instagram, so that's pretty cool.
357307	358976	Yeah, TikTok sucks for me too.
359016	360021	Like, I've tried that and...
361132	362033	Yeah, it's nothing.
363033	365915	I don't get a lot of... Maybe it's just the algorithm.
366015	368176	I don't get a lot of video gaming content on there at all.
368896	373279	And maybe that's just because... You have to follow more gamers.
373399	374259	I guess, yeah.
374620	379102	Actually, now that those words have left my mouth, you know what I do get all of the time?
379182	380463	Dead by Daylight people.
380863	382644	I get a lot of Dead by Daylight clips.
382944	385165	But I found some very interesting people on there.
385506	386046	There's this one.
386106	387347	I think she's one of the best...
388107	412279	uh explaining how she's playing the game of course I don't remember her name in the moment isn't Mish I want to say her name was not to be confused with our own chatter um but she does like explanations as she's looping killers and stuff it's probably one of the best at like multitasking explaining her logic while she's playing the game I was very impressed I missed LC doing that LC was really good at that too yeah they were they were
412879	439381	but I understand you know streaming is a hobby and people come and people go and that is what it is so um let's see Bobby Blackwell says you don't necessarily need to follow people but if you search out gaming videos and like some of them it will show more of all the social media algorithms I find TikToks to be the best to actually respecting what you like as well as respecting what you mark as not interested oh that's true I do love the not interested button because I've gotten a few of those where I'm like please don't ever show me this again so
440535	440955	Interesting.
441075	441335	All right.
441536	441896	Good to know.
441916	442256	Good to know.
443196	448339	Well, let's get into not just social media, but talking about what is going on in the gaming world.
448419	452041	And as we mentioned, Nintendo did announce new hardware this week.
452141	455843	Loki, do you want to tell us about what was not the Switch 2, unfortunately?
456723	458944	This is in the Switch too.
458984	460164	Remember all those leaks?
460484	463825	Get your clown makeup, everybody, that fell for this.
465005	467185	How many people are making up leaks?
467225	470766	But they were like, oh yeah, they're going to announce the Switch successor on October 10th.
470906	471386	It's coming.
471506	472287	No, they're not.
472347	473867	They were never going to do that.
474107	480728	But it's funny as hell that they announced this instead, I believe, on October 10th, if my math is right.
480768	481949	So they were half right.
482129	482709	Womp womp.
483840	488504	Yeah, it was actually Thursday, I believe, when they launched.
488664	489465	Which was the 10th!
490546	491366	Yeah.
491486	494028	No, Thursday would have been... I'm sorry.
494869	495430	It was Wednesday.
495470	496070	It was the 9th.
496190	497491	So it was the 9th, not the 10th.
497671	498072	My mistake.
499233	500554	But, whatever.
500894	502776	They announced Alarmo.
504177	504677	Alarmo.
504757	505738	It's the clock.
506178	507700	It's a clock that is...
509448	509768	DarkSakura.com
529113	529613	Yeah, it's neat.
529653	530973	What about cats?
531354	532394	That's what I want to know.
532454	534314	Or cats, yeah, cats could set it up.
534554	536855	I'm the first one to get up, always.
537075	543316	So that part wouldn't really bother me, but it's the cats, that part I'm concerned about.
543436	547557	Because the cats get on and off the bed all frickin' night.
548237	550038	So that's the part where I'm like, hmm.
551058	566251	Yeah, so you can buy this at physical Nintendo World locations, or for people that are subscribed to Switch Online, you can pre-order it, which I think it's sold out already, and that'll be shipping 2025.
566331	574598	It's got 35 scenes taken from different Nintendo games, and they have different wake-up modes, like gentle or steady.
575019	576160	So as, like...
577543	578063	Hey, listen!
578083	578223	Hey!
578303	578503	Listen!
578523	578663	Hey!
578723	578783	Hey!
578803	578863	Hey!
598550	605573	Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild, Animal Crossing, New Horizons, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, stuff like that.
605593	608374	They said there's going to be more free updates later on.
609955	611476	Update your alarm clock via Wi-Fi.
611496	611676	That's $100.
611776	612456	That's what we do now.
612536	613497	It's $100.
615548	617810	Um, so, neat?
618230	619171	I mean, I don't know.
619191	621193	You want that Nintendo nostalgia, everybody?
621213	622534	You better get up and pay.
623295	624015	I think it's neat.
624135	624616	I don't know.
624636	628819	It just... Sorry, SG100 Matt.
629039	630841	SG100 Matt in chat, brilliant comment.
630981	633062	Animal Crossing, where Mr. Resetti yells at you.
633243	633563	Yes.
634443	639247	Even if Mr. Resetti never really had a voice, per se, I would still just like the really loud... ...
643951	645312	That would be incredible.
646914	647154	I do.
647214	648595	I want to motor a Resetti LZU.
648635	649616	Future DLC, please.
652018	654180	Dark Tetsuya says at least the DLC is free.
654300	659765	I didn't even consider that they could charge for Alarm Clock DLC and that's the hellscape we'd be living in in 2024.
659805	659946	I mean...
665588	666288	Tiger Claw.
666348	669429	Nothing says that there isn't going to be paid DLC down the road.
671170	673991	Tiger Claw in chat says, how good is the sleep tracking?
674291	680353	Because you want more than just how many hours you were in the bed.
680653	683494	Does it track any of the other stuff like the sleep cycle?
683974	690816	It did not occur to me until Tiger Claw made that comment that Nintendo and its affiliates are obsessed with watching you sleep.
691616	693057	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
706621	717347	But I'm not going to sit here with the phone in the bed or this separate device that's really awkward to have in the bed with me and the cats and all that stuff and have this separate device to track my sleep.
717867	723891	If it were to integrate with the sleep tracking that already occurs on my watch, maybe I would be interested.
724031	726372	Well, call my bluff.
726432	728854	Guess what Pokemon sleep patched in in the last couple weeks?
729654	731394	It now will import tracking from your watch.
731815	734255	Well, there's always been Chinese, but it will now do Apple.
734375	735255	It does Apple Health.
736376	739856	It's syncing with Apple Health and I assume whatever the Google equivalent is.
740477	741557	And so your watch.
741737	743597	So it does Apple Watch sleep tracking now.
744078	749539	So you just don't get the random sound effects.
749559	756280	You can't hear yourself fart in the middle of the night because the device isn't randomly recording that, which really is a blessing.
756340	758021	Or in my case, it was always the cats.
759282	764749	Whatever it would record, you'd just hear like... That's what you were hearing recorded.
764970	767493	Oh, it's if I don't hear that enough at 4 a.m.
767913	769355	So, anyway.
769836	771799	But I'm just saying, Nintendo's obsessed...
773274	773554	I don't know.
773574	773834	I mean...
800353	800893	I'm just saying.
800913	801353	Who knows?
801674	803654	Nintendo is now in your bedroom watching you sleep.
805375	814099	I just, yeah, I worry that, you know, having something that's based off of motion tracking, yeah, do they know cats exist?
814259	815940	I mean, or animals exist?
816300	818661	Dogs are worse in that department, as I understand it.
818761	819902	I'm not a dog owner, but.
820962	822763	Yeah, I just can't imagine that that would be
825072	832975	I hope they have a manual mode where it's like, okay, I have to hit the light on top to shut the alarm off or something like that so that it's not motion-sensitive.
833575	845220	And then also, going to the sleep tracking, that's really the only thing I could see that they would be tracking is just your movement, which, I mean, I can't imagine that it'd be very accurate at all.
846875	847916	I will say this much.
848136	858679	As much as I think a lot of us can look at this and go, LOL, a clock, I think there's that part of me that sort of understands that Nintendo is without new hardware this year, right?
858739	860780	We know the Switch 2 is not happening this year.
861815	862895	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
881741	882882	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
907274	919864	Um, I, I, I see that like Nintendo's kind of cashing in on that nostalgia so that their financials can be boosted a bit this year, because let's be real, they're probably going to sell Switch systems, but they're not going to sell as many as they have in previous years.
920504	925508	They'll still sell some, and maybe there'll be like a new bundle this year to try to get people's attention.
925568	932853	You know, they'll, they'll, they'll do like a Mario Party bundle that has that new Jamboree or whatever it's called, you know, to just try to get more people in.
932894	934595	But that's, that's, that's where that ends.
935509	936949	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
957314	958574	I know, right?
958834	960795	Or an advanced class or something.
960835	962875	You want to talk about selling like hotcakes.
963056	967097	Yeah, I don't know why they're resistant to do that, but maybe it's one of those.
967137	968057	That's expensive to me.
968097	980040	I'm like, the Nintendo hard, like I understand the whole it's hard to make, it's expensive, but I'm like the track record should show that like Nintendo could make it and it's not going to flop.
980760	981600	It's not going to flop.
981620	984681	Basically, it would be essentially the same hardware.
984861	988183	I mean, yeah, it would be slightly more expensive because there would be a screen involved.
988763	992704	But, like, how expensive really is a small LCD screen?
992744	994925	Like, it can be very expensive.
994945	995905	Well, there's one on the clock!
997906	998646	Right, exactly.
998726	999687	There's one on the clock.
999747	1000627	Perfect example.
1000727	1001847	So, you sell the system for $100.
1001887	1001927	Um...
1005071	1010493	I mean, you could essentially have... I mean, even like the Game & Watch.
1010833	1014875	The Game & Watch things that they had, they were $50 at a really small LCD screen.
1014895	1016275	That's all you'd probably need.
1016336	1017396	Maybe something slightly bigger.
1017936	1018756	Not that expensive.
1018957	1026820	And the hardware to run it is essentially the same thing that you had with those classic consoles or whatever.
1027260	1030741	I suppose making it run off a battery would be extra expensive.
1031642	1032122	I mean, they could...
1033151	1033852	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1053021	1054022	It's been a while.
1054082	1054462	I don't know.
1072156	1074277	And here's my reasoning behind that.
1074637	1078200	After so many years, there'd be a new audience for that.
1078220	1080421	And hell, half the people that wanted to buy it couldn't anyway.
1080781	1082362	Remember, those things were impossible to get.
1083363	1086064	Yeah, Bobby's talking about buying them off the treasure truck.
1086084	1087305	Those things are very hard to find.
1087665	1089626	So I think a second printing of those would do very well.
1089906	1090687	And here's the thing.
1090847	1096750	All you have to do, this would piss people off, but five years, six years after the fact, they're going to be less angry about it.
1097070	1099072	You do things with it you didn't do the first time.
1099372	1100012	And there's two...
1101713	1110737	Three, now that I think about it, three things they could easily do, easily do that would make this thing, people would buy it all over again.
1110837	1113779	Number one, add internet play to it.
1115391	1118553	Just like the Switch, Switch Online does internet play on their games.
1118933	1123035	In fact, it would be even cooler if you could do internet play with Switch Online, but I'm not going to go that far.
1123095	1130539	I'm not going to, but just add online so I could play Classic at home with, you know, Loki or DarkSakura, the Classic at their house.
1130679	1131859	That's number one thing they could do.
1131920	1134161	Number two, just add five more games.
1134901	1156832	just add five more games like you know get get get the right licensing you could even get Konami is like bargain basementing their entire archive right now like look at all the like new Castlevania stuff that's come out partner up with Konami to add like five or ten classic additional games to the archive do it right there or number three and here's the one they would never do
1157392	1159013	They would never do it.
1159393	1160594	But I'm going to say it anyway.
1160614	1162175	I'm going to be ridiculous and say it anyway.
1162215	1165597	Because what did the Atari flashback do?
1165957	1170220	Which, by the way, there's been like fucking nine Atari flashbacks.
1170440	1170900	Nine.
1171461	1175243	And they finally finished the flashback, per se.
1175563	1181286	But they're still cranking out Ataris every year with something.
1182267	1185709	And how did they get to nine flashback consoles?
1186209	1186650	Homebrew.
1187725	1192908	They embraced the homebrew community and started adding homebrew games to it and that whole type of thing.
1193389	1195170	Loki, what do you think?
1195650	1199773	Pixel poops number two as if Nintendo would ever embrace a game with that title.
1199793	1200333	They would never.
1200353	1202014	Sorry, but let's imagine.
1202355	1205937	Let's put on the hat of ludicrousness.
1206057	1208379	Let's put on the hat of ludicrousness for a minute.
1208399	1208899	The hat of ludicrousness.
1209660	1228722	and just imagine Nintendo puts Pixel Poops number two on the NES classic number two and actually embraces the homebrew community and then like oh my god all these new NES games people would eat that shit up they literally and they would they would love it so
1230430	1234895	Anyway, no, what's funny, Bobby, no, I did not watch the Atari 50 DLC yet.
1235375	1240741	I literally am thinking about how the flashback was put out nine times.
1241762	1244004	So, yeah.
1244044	1245726	Did it have it coming?
1246507	1246927	It had it.
1248249	1249350	It ran into my target.
1249690	1251332	It ran into my target nine times.
1252580	1282195	well and like I understand like that they may be worried I guess that it would cannibalize like the value of the any the Nintendo online service which I don't think so because I think people would buy that stuff especially if we were talking like a Game Boy or something like that people would still buy that even if they had a Switch already they would just buy everything that Nintendo puts out for a lot of the stuff so I don't know if that would necessarily cannibalize a lot of things I don't know
1283315	1283836	Yeah, we'll see.
1284377	1285518	Probably not ever going to happen.
1285798	1288581	Bobby's talking about the flashback embracing homebrew in the DLC videos.
1288621	1296930	Yes, you know what actually is probably bringing it front of mind is that I've been on this retro gaming kick that's the whole YouTube thing I'm building and all that stuff lately.
1297530	1300954	And what is interesting is that retro achievements actually...
1301414	1302535	I don't know what you're talking about.
1323230	1326772	But at the same time, I understand homebrew has got a big community.
1327433	1331095	So I don't want to poo-poo on the homebrew stuff because they do good work.
1331175	1334596	But maybe that's what had homebrew in front of mind for me a little bit too.
1335157	1336277	But yeah.
1336798	1343001	Anyway, no matter how I got there, I still say the NES Classics could sell 50 million more of them.
1343902	1349845	Another number I just made up by including homebrew as one of the three easy fucking changes they can make.
1350265	1351566	Easy fucking changes they can make.
1353451	1359136	SG-100 Matt also points out if Nintendo cared about game preservation, these classic systems are the easiest thing they can do.
1359316	1360236	Just saying.
1360356	1366661	Well, I don't know if the first part of your statement is a truthful statement when it comes to Nintendo, unfortunately.
1366781	1368643	But we'll debate that another day.
1368703	1371345	In the meantime, we'll get into our gaming weeks and the types of games.
1371385	1372486	They care about preservation.
1372506	1373646	That's why they have a museum.
1373706	1375108	Now all of you are going to get sued.
1375148	1375568	There you go.
1375748	1376268	Yeah, that's right.
1376288	1380392	They have the museum where you can pay an admission fee to care about preservation.
1380412	1380572	Yes.
1380672	1380892	All right.
1380972	1386737	Anyway, let's get in and talk about preserving our gaming weeks for all time here on the archive of this program.
1387098	1388399	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1388699	1389920	What video games you've been playing this week?
1393323	1397526	I think DarkSakura may have... Oh, I just got texted audio problems.
1397947	1401069	So we'll just come back to DarkSakura in a minute when I know she's back.
1401690	1402370	So we'll go to Loki.
1402410	1403051	How was your gaming week?
1404178	1406961	My gaming week was Minecraft as usual.
1407021	1413387	So I've been working on the next big expansion to my theme park, which is the boardwalk.
1414448	1421575	And as part of that, I've been working on creating functional midway attractions.
1421716	1423077	So I have...
1425788	1443000	it's I guess I don't know what you call it I guess it's like the pop the balloon game thing like the clowns that you squirt the water in the mouse except obviously you can't do that in Minecraft so the equivalent is throwing snowballs at a target to light up lights um arrows would have been my guess but okay yeah
1443140	1443900	Yeah, something like that.
1443940	1447981	So I have that created already.
1448121	1449561	I'm also working on one now.
1449801	1456463	It's one of those horse racing games where you dunk baskets and it makes the little horse move along.
1458563	1462644	And so I'm actually getting that pretty far along as well.
1462944	1464124	So I'm going to be adding those in.
1464224	1470005	I added a roller coaster based off of the West Coaster at the Santa Monica Pier.
1473911	1474631	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1493433	1494694	Out the top of it and stuff.
1494714	1495475	It looks really cool.
1495515	1503541	Kind of like one of those big inflatable gorillas that you see on the top of car dealerships or something like that.
1503561	1505363	It looks really cool.
1505383	1508966	The next episode is going to be pretty big because there's a lot of stuff to do.
1508986	1516272	Like I said, still trying to work on timing and everything because I have a lot to do before the end of the season.
1516292	1521056	I've got a couple weeks off in November to work exclusively on that stuff.
1521356	1521776	And then...
1523067	1525789	Yeah, I think it's coming along, so it should be pretty exciting.
1525809	1526589	Look for that very soon.
1526749	1534534	I hate you're taking a vacation from work to do more work, but at the same time, I guess Thanksgiving, we all like doing that work better than work work, you know?
1534574	1539717	It's like, I don't know, they're having us come into the office for three days for funsies.
1540137	1541718	It's like, okay.
1541818	1542258	Thanks.
1543178	1550323	Which, by the way, speaking of Thanksgiving, before I forget, because I will forget, happy Canadian Thanksgiving to our friends up north tomorrow, if I remember right.
1551550	1552593	Yay Canada!
1553796	1555761	Which we hear DarkSakura again, so I know you're back.
1555802	1557366	Hello, hello, how was your gaming week, DarkSakura?
1558325	1558805	SoloQ SoloQ
1584472	1584913	Swift.
1586175	1590141	It works in a custom match with, well, one other person anyway.
1591062	1592625	And I can play killer.
1593907	1595629	I got a 5k on pig.
1596471	1597192	Not even trying.
1598820	1599861	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1617751	1625135	My glider doesn't show up all the time so it just looks like I've got my hands over my head with big O hands and that's kind of weird.
1625995	1633379	I went back to playing Sailor Moon Another Story for Super Famicom which is my retro game I've been playing.
1634560	1657138	and I finished Sailor Mars's story I will be starting on Sailor Jupiter's story next week of course I did not do my normal polya stream on Friday because it was the start of Yom Kippur so I was massively incommunicado until sundown last night so um
1658810	1660392	I'm going to say this right now, people.
1660792	1663934	Don't wish someone a happy Yom Kippur, okay?
1664755	1667277	Just wish them a good holiday.
1668558	1668878	Yeah.
1669579	1671000	Anyway.
1671901	1674703	I also played around with some other games.
1675844	1683170	I was going to start one of the Berserk games, but it's not playing right.
1683210	1687533	I may actually just have to bust out my Dreamcast and play through the Japanese version again.
1688995	1709697	you know just doing a few things here and there playing some Klonoa I love Klonoa but it's so depressing and yeah and the Suika game of course because I'm kind of stupidly addicted to that torture alright good times yeah SSJ100 Matt agrees not a happy holiday
1711145	1712986	My gaming week has kind of been in two bits.
1713606	1716547	I am still trucking along with my retro thing for YouTube.
1717267	1718648	I did a thing for two weeks.
1718788	1719068	Yay.
1719108	1720448	I haven't broke my streak yet.
1720548	1725250	So I've made more videos than the last time I tried to do something like this, which was like 10 years ago.
1725750	1730772	So this week I put some more videos up on two Atari 2600 games.
1730852	1736674	I did H-E-R-O for the 2600, which is a fun little helicopter rescue game that I remember from when I was younger.
1737474	1763253	and then we did a game called Frostbite which is kind of like it's like Frogger but a little bit different so we did that and then we did the original Mario Brothers not Super but original Mario Brothers with the pipes and everything for the Nintendo Entertainment System I did videos on all those for this week so you can check that out on my YouTube channel which is Rob Roberts Plays over on YouTube don't go to just Rob Roberts because he makes guns apparently is the other Rob Roberts so Rob Roberts Plays is where you would go to see those videos
1764914	1790868	and then pretty much all of my gaming week as far as newer games go Diablo 4 because and with good reason this isn't just Rob plays the same thing over and over I mean it is a little bit but it's also we got an expansion this week so Vessel of Hatred was out this week and so I've been playing with the new expansion and all of that still not through the main story yet I think I'm getting close but I'm not done with the main story yet but yeah they added I mean
1791548	1799307	I will say for as much shit as the Diablo 4 team was getting for putting out an expansion a year after the game came out...
1800805	1828738	I will admit they must have a ton of developers on this game because the expansion is pretty stacked with additional content like it's not just the fact they have a whole new story in it but they have these whole new systems like there's this undercity dungeon which is a way to get you know it's kind of like leveling of a different type where you get certain types of gear rewards at the end with that they have the whole dark citadel is a new thing I haven't touched yet you know they have so they and that they'd be rebalancing a lot of skills and jobs and classes and things so there's there's a lot of
1829859	1831988	There's a lot of that going on so far.
1833945	1836387	Where there's like just all these different systems and things to get into.
1836787	1838748	Yeah, QuestBuster says, I've been enjoying it so far.
1838829	1840590	The Spiritborn class is pretty fun.
1841110	1848135	I've only touched Spiritborn a little bit because the other day, Grandpa Warcraft crashed my stream.
1848175	1855780	I was streaming it one day this week and Grandpa Warcraft came in and crashed my stream, which I haven't talked to him in a while, like live on stream.
1856221	1859983	And he really wanted to play Diablo with me, but I'm like, do you own the expansion?
1860043	1861885	He's like, no, but we can still play, right?
1861905	1862905	And I was like, okay, okay.
1863766	1865508	Here's the best way for me to play with Matt.
1866308	1868130	We're going to play hardcore mode.
1868730	1872854	So hardcore mode in Diablo 4 is if you die in the game, you die in real life.
1873134	1875396	No, that's not really what it is, but that's why I keep joking it is.
1875856	1878559	Hardcore mode is if you die in the game, that's it.
1878919	1882002	Character deleted, gone, deleted.
1882402	1887827	So I think it would be the funniest thing to get him killed in a hardcore mode.
1889758	1894561	But we only got to about level 5 until I had to end the stream because dinner was done.
1894921	1897722	But I started as Spiritborn so I could play that.
1897822	1903205	And he rolled a freaking Sorcerer, which is like the squishiest of all of the characters.
1903626	1907068	So that's going to be really funny when we pick that stream up again.
1907428	1908769	He will die before level 15.
1909429	1909989	Guarantee.
1910489	1911130	Guarantee.
1912190	1912671	So we'll...
1914352	1915372	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1937981	1944044	are characters that are mumbling in what sounds like a made-up language.
1944184	1953888	I don't know if it's supposed to be Latin or Armaic or some really, really ancient type of language sort of thing in these cutscenes, but it sounds made up.
1954608	1962432	I don't want to say it's a made-up language and then find out it actually is a real language and I'm just too uneducated to know what it is.
1962972	1992105	but I would say there's a lot of scenes where characters are doing various incantations you know because Diablo 4 is about hell it's all these like demon summoning things that are going on all the time or like stopping demon summonings or summoning something else that's not a demon but probably is a demon anyway there's way too much of that happening in various cutscenes so I would say that is probably the best criticism of Diablo 4 I've seen yet is way too much mumbling of demonic incantations
1992805	2019160	so that's that's where I am with that ambiance Rob ambiance yeah but it's sort of it's like if if a character's doing it in the background that's ambiance but if you happen to listen to somebody go on and on for 30 seconds every five minutes yeah it gets to be a lot I just thought of a drag name what I'm Beyonce I'm Beyonce I thought you were gonna say Amber Amber aunts I don't know no I'm Beyonce
2020362	2023148	Who could probably hang out with my friends to lingerie.
2023289	2025313	What about Amber Unce?
2025353	2025393	No.
2025594	2026776	On Beyoncé.
2026796	2026997	Fine.
2027017	2028480	It's on Beyoncé.
2031055	2053363	Questbuster in chat says it's like some kind of themed language and yes there's quite a bit of it I'm like I get it Narelle you're chanting yes exactly it's not just her like at least three characters what's their job in the game demonic chants what it's constant noise that doesn't stop as a murmur that's hell while you're standing in line
2056090	2057891	for a ride that breaks down when you get to the front.
2058992	2059172	Right.
2059632	2059912	All right.
2060633	2060973	Anyway.
2061873	2064215	Only to find out that you have to draw a number for the next line.
2065755	2066336	Let's move on.
2066496	2069077	Let's get into the rest of the gaming news this week.
2069577	2073340	Usually I would say housekeeping, show schedule, things like that.
2073420	2074520	I don't have a lot to say right now.
2074580	2075941	So let's just get into the next story.
2076001	2076301	Loki.
2078042	2080083	Well, got to leak them all.
2080503	2080724	So...
2082389	2088593	Apparently, Game Freak has been hacked and a bunch of their data has been leaked out.
2088853	2093256	What people are calling a giga leak or terra leak or whatever the case may be.
2093316	2095217	It's a lot of data that's been leaked.
2095858	2097499	Hold on real quick.
2098139	2098840	Is it a leak?
2100140	2104042	I was getting into this at the end of Bobby's show tonight when he did the toss call.
2104263	2108105	Is it a leak when somebody purposely drilled a hole in the wall?
2108205	2109986	Because this information was stolen.
2110046	2111747	Let's call it what it is.
2112147	2113548	This information was stolen.
2114268	2117790	It sounds like through some sort of phishing thing, this whole thing was stolen.
2117850	2121452	Is that really a leak or is that a giga theft at this point?
2122612	2131477	It's a leak of information because it is bypassed the threshold for which they had put in place.
2132438	2139622	If you have someone sabotaging a boat by poking a hole in it, it's still a leak.
2140495	2140975	I guess.
2141416	2141716	I guess.
2141776	2142076	I don't know.
2142096	2145138	It just seems the terminology is a little weird to me, but that's fine.
2145578	2152163	Anyway, I also want to say this because some people would frown on us giving this light of day because it is stolen information.
2152723	2153524	Here's the reality.
2153744	2158287	We're a talk show about video games, gaming culture, and gaming lifestyle.
2158347	2161989	And gaming culture is that people steal things.
2162069	2162730	No, that's not it.
2162790	2164531	Unfortunately, maybe there's some truth in that.
2164651	2169955	But the reality is people on social media are talking about this a lot.
2170975	2178797	Y'all know my buddy Shane, who's been on the show many times, loves Pokemon, and has been blowing up my phone all weekend with stuff coming out of this, which has been interesting.
2179337	2182898	I don't mean that in a negative way, because it's been interesting, some of the stuff that's coming out of this.
2183318	2186879	I invited him on the show tonight, by the way, to talk about this.
2186939	2189179	I was like, can I get a Pokemon expert, please, to come on the show?
2189539	2195281	And I was declined, so that he could go raid in Final Fantasy XIV, because that's what friendship is.
2196081	2204868	But, I will just say, I did invite a real expert to come on and talk tonight, but I will do my best with Loki and DarkSakura to get through what is out there.
2204908	2211953	So anyway, yeah, exactly, PrincePeachFuzz, I haven't seen that name in a while, hihi, says in chat, saying it's already out on the internet.
2212053	2212533	Exactly.
2213034	2220819	Like, however the leak was done, whether it was accidental or, you know, not so much, it's out there.
2221460	2222220	So, I...
2223361	2228747	I'm not going to show you pictures or video because we're just not going to do that.
2228828	2230269	But if you want to go find it, it's out there.
2230589	2231370	Anyway, sorry, Loki.
2231390	2234193	I just wanted to address that up front before the comments come in.
2234954	2235615	No, no worries.
2236236	2239760	Yeah, so, I mean, a lot of it is just kind of...
2240967	2246589	basic information that's not necessarily super important, like, you know, code names and stuff like that.
2247189	2253572	So apparently, though, there is some stuff that has leaked out, some source code that's leaked out.
2253612	2259494	So the fifth generation games like HeartGold and SoulSilver have had their source leaked.
2260455	2262375	Wow, you just made PowWorld's job easier.
2262715	2263436	Ba-dum-bum-psh.
2265577	2268738	We have apparently the code name for the
2269611	2272633	the new console that Nintendo's working on called Ounce.
2274013	2274674	Amber Ounce!
2277035	2279837	Take that with an ounce of salt, I guess.
2280957	2289022	And then apparently there's also some mention or references to a codename Gaia.
2290783	2292304	Also, you know,
2293479	2294880	I believe that's Gen 10.
2295040	2296541	Gaia's Generation 10, I believe.
2297021	2299742	Gen 10, and then also something called Synapse.
2300603	2301864	So there's all your code names.
2301924	2304225	I'm sure it's spoiled so many things for you.
2305566	2309668	Wait, you mean they're making a new mainline Pokemon game?
2309948	2310208	What?
2310768	2312629	And it's gonna be on the successor to the Switch?
2312749	2312909	What?
2312929	2314911	It's gonna be spin-off games too?
2314951	2315091	What?
2316644	2316984	what?
2318545	2344393	apparently there's also they said that there's been leaked details about the upcoming anime series, the live action spinoffs including plot details for the second Detective Pikachu film I'm sure that the spoilers for the next Detective Pikachu film will be that Ryan Reynolds does things and then let's see, also potentially a live action movie codenamed Game Boy
2346894	2373086	all these codenames man learning so much okay okay but now you know why now you know why they use codenames because this is a wonderful case and point why they use codenames because even though all of this got out it still doesn't tell us that much food for thought anyway yeah
2374722	2381205	Yeah, and then as I mentioned, HeartGold and SoulSilver leaked, as well as the code for Black 2 and White 2.
2383586	2401854	So yeah, and then of course, the Pokemon Company has released a statement saying that, you know, over 2,000 pieces of employee data were subject to unauthorized access by a third party, and it says we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience and concern this may have caused to all concerned.
2403534	2406735	As I understand it, I just want to point out, because this is very interesting to me.
2407716	2413257	This is the part I'm not sure a lot of people are going to lay up and frame, and I just kind of want to shine a light on this.
2413437	2423200	I think this is very interesting that when Game Freak acknowledges the hack, they talk about the leak of the employee data, which is a very negative thing.
2423700	2424761	kind of thing, right?
2424802	2426223	That's like a big no-no.
2427284	2440176	There may have been acknowledgement or something about the game data, but they are quick to put a light on the employee data that was stolen because that's probably the part where if they ever wanted to prosecute the people that did this, they would want to focus on that.
2440597	2447203	But there's been some really weird, and again, I'm going to openly admit, I'm not sure how this all works because I am not in the
2447643	2448504	and DarkSakura.com
2476756	2491531	There is nothing about, like, so it confirms this stuff about Gen 10 being on Switchu, but apparently there is further information about Gen 10, and most importantly, Pokemon Legends Z to A apparently has a lot of stuff.
2492412	2496096	The hackers are not publishing anything about that.
2496716	2498158	They are keeping that under wraps.
2499161	2503102	which I find fascinating to have the complete lack of ethics.
2503202	2512045	In fact, the opposite of ethics to do what they did and then at the same time have the ethics to say, but we're not going to put out the employee data.
2512726	2513846	That's not what this is about.
2515246	2521328	But Game Freak in their announcement, in spite of that, still says 2,000 employees had their data stolen.
2521769	2525670	That is a layup for wanting to go after this later on in court.
2526889	2528370	That's the only thing I want to spotlight.
2528510	2533672	Even though the leakers are not going to put that data out there, Game Freak wants you to know it was stolen.
2535013	2536173	I just thought that was interesting.
2536213	2536533	That's all.
2539154	2545477	Here's another interesting thing that's apparently happening during this leak is that some information is now... Now, here's the thing.
2545557	2551620	Now that we know it's on the internet, I know this is going to shock you, but some people...
2553618	2554078	Wait for it.
2554118	2554499	Wait for it.
2554999	2557641	Some people on the internet lie.
2558542	2559203	I'm really sorry.
2559223	2559823	I know.
2559963	2560244	I know.
2561525	2563566	Some people on the internet lie.
2563666	2567710	Some people, they get out of bed in the morning and they say, you know what?
2567770	2572013	Today, I am going to spread misinformation on the internet.
2574335	2577098	And that misinformation might actually be about...
2578408	2579909	Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time.
2601738	2602599	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2624844	2650849	very interesting I would almost I don't know if you would call that the white hat white hat hacking or the the counter leak leaks but now people are making shit up that sounds here comes the word everybody get your shot glass everybody that sounds plausible and mixing it in with the real like leak data so that way the leaks will ultimately get proven to be fake
2652011	2654032	because fake data got mixed in with the real data.
2654652	2656653	I think that's really interesting.
2657994	2661576	I guess it's actually not interesting at all, but it's like that.
2661696	2664097	It's that human behavior element of it.
2664218	2672282	And just like, you know, again, people waking up in the morning and saying, I'm going to go lie to people on the internet today, but I'm doing it for a good reason.
2673749	2682652	Because what I'm doing is I'm helping the Pokemon company from all this, you know, leak or game freak, I should say specifically because those are separate entities.
2682973	2686214	But I'm helping game freak from what's going on in this situation.
2687894	2688675	It's just interesting.
2688695	2691856	Of course, the chat room is lighting up with, wait, people on the internet lie?
2691916	2692336	What do you do?
2692376	2692636	What?
2694077	2694237	So.
2695939	2699502	I think that part of it is, yeah, that's something.
2700143	2707509	But now you have to take all this stuff that you're seeing out of the leaks with a grain of salt because people are amplifying lies to mix in with the regular leaks.
2710792	2714856	So what at the end of the day does the Giga leak really tell us?
2715953	2716513	Not a lot.
2716533	2718314	Those are people who can't think of a new name.
2719535	2725639	Well, and the source code stuff is pretty serious, but they are dated games at this point.
2726440	2733304	It will affect the homebrew community probably because that'll be huge for making clone games and things of that sort and hacks and stuff like that.
2733324	2739267	But at that point, again, it's not like new copies of Black and White 2 are being sold.
2739327	2744751	I mean, those are the next games in line for a remake, but they'll remake them and they'll still sell because they're remakes.
2745171	2748772	So, I mean, the source code to all that stuff getting leaked is kind of a whatever.
2749352	2757394	There's like a map editor that I know was found as part of like the official Pokemon map editor for I think Gen 3 or something was in this.
2757894	2760895	But again, if you're in the homebrew community, awesome.
2761315	2764356	If not, that doesn't really change anything.
2764716	2766776	These are games that are very, very old at this point.
2767977	2772278	And it's an interesting look behind the scene at all of these Pokemon.
2772918	2773723	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2777179	2783323	Any game that has ever been made probably had things cut from it that you never got to see.
2784164	2788086	That's why that one website, it's Cutting Room Floor, is that the name of it?
2788767	2789367	I think so.
2789387	2803377	Yeah, that website is fascinating because that website collects all that type of stuff and puts it out there like, hey, here's how the demo of the ROM changed to the real thing and the music they subbed out and all that stuff.
2803417	2805738	So that part, yeah, it's interesting.
2805798	2806539	But beyond that,
2807540	2810002	You know, and again, I'm not... I want to make sure I'm clear.
2810042	2818651	I'm not trying to minimize what these fishers did because they did a fucked up thing that should not be rewarded or applauded or any of that stuff.
2819492	2820693	So I do not want to...
2822623	2824926	There's a reason that information security exists.
2843072	2851037	Yes, and there's a reason why probably any company you've ever worked for has some form of anti-phishing awareness.
2851437	2861904	If your company is on the internet, you probably take some sort of information security or anti-phishing thing to try to teach you how to not fall for these types of emails.
2862264	2866306	But my understanding is this is getting worse.
2866466	2868047	And you know why it's getting worse?
2868428	2871109	You know what is really fucking up phishing for everybody?
2871750	2871990	AI.
2873427	2873547	Yeah.
2873647	2873767	Yeah.
2899656	2900016	Yeah, Tiberi!
2900036	2900356	Fuck yeah!
2923797	2925899	Oh, is there just a... Holy smokes.
2925999	2932184	Okay, usually because we're taping a podcast, I don't stop to acknowledge every donation live on Twitch.
2932704	2939510	But when somebody dumps 10 gift subs like Sia Tabiri just did, I have to stop and say thank you very much.
2939670	2941011	That's really incredible.
2941071	2941532	Thank you all.
2941572	2944814	You guys... You guys... Thank you, everyone.
2944834	2945995	We love you too.
2946696	2947296	Thank you so much.
2947376	2948077	You guys are the best.
2948497	2948938	Bobby!
2950933	2951233	All right.
2951894	2952434	Thank you, Bobby.
2952514	2953375	All right, let's move on.
2953435	2963643	Let's talk about what is going on with Steam because this is a direct result of some things that have happened in the legal world within the past couple weeks.
2964083	2978254	You know, there was a new California law that was signed into law that basically will mandate that companies that sell you things online, sell you a license to things online, will now have to tell you that this is a license and it can be revoked at any time.
2978374	2978674	It's AB 2426.
2981076	2987461	So you won't see buy and purchase games because you're not really buying and purchasing games that they can take away from you.
2988002	2996469	We talked about this whole thing like, wow, you know Ubisoft fucked up really bad when they're passing a law so that it makes it harder for them to do that in the future.
2996829	3000952	Well, the first company has come into compliance with this law real quick, and that's Steam.
3001513	3006757	So in the Steam store now, you will see a notice in the bottom right that says when you're going to
3007177	3030380	continue to payment instead of buy you continue to payment it says a purchase of a digital product grants a license for the product on Steam and then it says for full terms and conditions please see the Steam subscriber agreement so so Steam is essentially already moving things into place for that even though technically it doesn't have to be until next year um
3031516	3036199	But I think, you know, when you're Steam, you sort of see the writing on the wall.
3036619	3041442	You realize it's not just the actual court that is moving this direction, meaning California.
3041622	3046705	And, you know, there will be other states that pass similar laws in the coming year, guarantee it.
3047126	3055631	But at the same time, because California passed it and it's very hard to tell on the Internet where somebody is actually coming in from.
3055871	3056311	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3072883	3079409	They should have to say this type of thing, that you are only licensing the content because companies are taking things away.
3079650	3081551	And maybe, you know, that's a real issue.
3081591	3085495	This is why physical media is still superior for a lot of people.
3086035	3094944	Even though physical media is getting harder and harder to find as more retail stores are no longer having them on the shelves because people aren't buying them.
3096665	3096905	So...
3098619	3107945	It's interesting that Steam has made this change so early, but I think on one hand, when they know that the court of public opinion is swaying this way, they're just doing it.
3108425	3112908	And do you really think Steam is going to sell any less games because of this?
3114435	3114615	No.
3114996	3115776	No, they won't.
3116096	3119158	Steam is still going to be the behemoth in the PC gaming space.
3120199	3124141	Goggle get to throw some shade and do their thing and maybe get a couple new customers.
3124161	3124801	Which they have.
3124821	3125402	Which they have.
3125762	3130765	And I'm sure there are some people reevaluating, hmm, what platform should... And maybe they have gotten a few customers from it.
3131165	3133407	But on the wider picture...
3134167	3136968	This probably is not going to affect things tremendously.
3137449	3145012	So yeah, S2100Matt says, might as well get ahead of it before someone in their basement in New Mexico sues you in a class action suit.
3145152	3145673	Exactly.
3146193	3148414	Like just avoid the legal thing later.
3149214	3149935	Add the statement.
3150195	3151115	It's not a big deal.
3151575	3154697	People are talking about it this week and next week they will have forgotten.
3156072	3156472	DarkSakura
3182728	3188652	Yeah, so another bit to the Humble Games saga.
3189573	3199359	We know that they laid off their entire staff, but now they're bringing in another third party to help support the...
3200820	3225116	operations and restructuring so they are working with Good Games Group which is a new indie publisher that was set up by Alan Patmore and Mark Nash who were former Humble Games leaders to quote further support previously released titles end quote and this is going along with their partnership with the Powell Group that took over their publishing operations so um
3226316	3226436	So, I...
3248030	3258737	I don't know how this is going to plan out or what it's going to look like for developers working with them or for any of the current things.
3258897	3264380	But this seems like it's very poorly executed.
3265421	3271424	I hate having anyone laid off and I hate to see a company that I once believed in flounder.
3272545	3277248	But at the same time, this is... It's unsurprising.
3278564	3301618	well it's it almost feels like it's like outsourcing the entire company is what this boils down to which is well what company really is there left yeah right you know they they it's like cutting off your legs and expecting to run a marathon you got to get that outside help to get you to to get down the path right yeah
3302796	3308258	Well, while people are evaluating what stores they shop from this week, this is something to consider.
3308338	3313760	Although, to be fair, Humble Games still raises money for charity, which is important.
3314000	3317441	That's why I was sad.
3317461	3328224	I kind of believed in what they were doing, and now I'm not so sure if they're going to function like any other big profit company in that respect.
3328404	3329245	Yeah, fair.
3329485	3329865	Totally fair.
3331489	3332824	Alright, well let's move on, Loki.
3334264	3362424	Alright So Game Pass is getting an update here pretty soon which is actually coming back to a promise that they had made a while ago saying that eventually you'll be able to play the games that you own through xCloud and now that is a thing that is going to be going into I guess testing in November for Insiders so that's going to be a thing that they're going to be adding to the Game Pass Ultimate members
3363602	3392238	and that'll be pretty cool that you'll be able to play your library that you have um but stream it and not just limited to the stuff that's available in xCloud um very cool I don't know uh they said yeah we're excited to share later this year it's our intent to roll out the ability for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members to play from the cloud select games that they already own or purchase outside of the Game Pass library um
3394761	3395022	Neat.
3396106	3396467	I don't know.
3396848	3397551	That's exciting.
3399795	3409522	Yeah, I seem to remember when they were advertising this before, it was like, oh, this sounds like it could be very interesting that you could play a game that basically is on your Xbox from anywhere else.
3410283	3413005	I thought that was really interesting, but then it just didn't happen.
3413065	3416307	And there was a part of me that was going, well, maybe I misunderstood what they were trying to do.
3416727	3420390	So it is kind of nice to see like, oh, no, they are still going that direction.
3421090	3428396	But I am very curious if some games are going to end up magically excluded from this because of some weird licensing issues.
3428976	3434558	which again, getting your game playable on more screens should be a good thing.
3434778	3445163	I can't think of why a company would not want to cut off from the screen and get additional sales unless there is some strange exclusive agreement, I guess could be a thing that suddenly magically shows up.
3445683	3464382	but um yeah I'll be I I'll check this out when it rolls out you know I I just got a shiny new phone so you know why although I don't think playing games on a touch screen is very fun it's pretty easy now to hook up a bluetooth controller to your phone and do things that way so that might be kind of fun when traveling and things like that so
3466528	3489587	E3BL says worried about latency issues so yeah it's not going to work for every game but maybe something that's a little bit more of a slower pace like we had a joke in the opening tonight about Bellatro that might be a perfect game for something like this the latency is not a huge issue and there's a lot of games that are paced at a slower rate where that might work pretty well to play through the cloud on that
3490458	3491839	What is that, Civ 7?
3492119	3492879	Is that the new one?
3492979	3494079	Oh yeah, Civ 7's coming.
3494120	3495860	Yep, good example as well.
3496761	3500302	So there's some games where it's not as big of a deal where I'd be very curious about that.
3500322	3504444	Yeah, I wouldn't try to play music games or even fighting games.
3504464	3505044	Street Fighter 6.
3505184	3506665	Yeah, would be very difficult.
3506785	3509586	Although the technology's getting better and better.
3509666	3516649	They do that whole... Now they're using AI predictive stuff to try to... Basically like...
3517489	3532066	it's generating three things that can happen based on what you could do at a certain moment and then it reacts to whatever it is you just did like that weird type of thing is what they do now to make the cloud streaming even better so it'll be interesting to see how that develops
3533103	3533343	All right.
3533784	3534605	Well, here's the game.
3534645	3540451	I'm not sure how well this would play on the cloud, but Tomb Raider is getting more remasters.
3540892	3549421	Tomb Raider 4, 5, and 6 are getting updated graphics and controls to bring them into modern world.
3549782	3552084	That will be on February 14th, 2025 when this is coming out.
3553866	3555847	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3578513	3584597	Also, if you are a trophy whore, you can get 150 trophies on the PlayStation version of the game.
3585097	3587219	I'm sure Xbox would have an equivalent thing.
3588620	3595464	Actually, no, this is only... Actually, now I see Tomb Raider 4, 5, 6 Remastered is actually only announced right now for PS4 and PS5.
3596065	3600708	So I'm not sure why Xbox is being cut out, which is weird, but okay.
3601008	3603830	Maybe it's just not confirmed for that platform yet.
3604651	3606252	But 150 trophies will be in this.
3606412	3608213	Nods to iconic moments from the series.
3608693	3613575	If you enjoyed the photo mode in the Tomb Raider 1 through 3 remastered, that will be back as well.
3617056	3629761	Also, one reason maybe why I do not recall there ever being a Tomb Raider 6 is because these games were originally released as Tomb Raider The Last Revelation, Tomb Raider Chronicles, and Tomb Raider The Angel of Darkness.
3629821	3633303	Well, to be fair, I don't remember any of those games either, so there is that.
3636429	3645253	It does seem like we're getting all these new Tomb Raider games lately, but perhaps that has something to do with the Netflix show Tomb Raider The Legend of Lara Croft.
3647013	3654216	There is also a Lara Croft live show with Phoebe Waller-Bridge, you might remember, who is cast in the role that's being made for Prime Video.
3654796	3663740	So, Lara Croft is famous again, like it's 20 years ago all over again, but I think it's a good character to be coming back.
3663780	3664080	Why not?
3664660	3664940	Why not?
3666459	3668581	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3687794	3689435	It's on their Twatter account.
3690496	3691376	They have said so.
3691637	3693318	I am so looking forward to this.
3693758	3696620	And I think it's a really good time to put on an announcement like this.
3696820	3701483	If you saw Alien Romulus, I don't really want to spoil anything for people.
3701603	3702844	It's a very good movie.
3702984	3703885	Definitely go see it.
3705246	3710509	But there are scenes when they're inside this vessel, I'm just going to say.
3710529	3711850	Okay.
3715072	3724683	and it looks like the scenes were taken right out of Alien Isolation and even the director said he was quite a bit influenced by the game.
3726165	3731691	And I thought it handled the retrofuturism quite nicely and the character for...
3734262	3740084	Amanda Ripley had been so popular that she made it into a couple of comic series and I think a novel.
3741764	3747365	And so I'm really hoping to see more of her story.
3747806	3749106	I really think this is going to be great.
3749866	3755928	So there have been, of course, releases on mobile and on Switch.
3758440	3783949	but I mean and if you haven't played the first game or if you have trouble playing those kinds of games at least watch a playthrough of it it's really good really good and even to me like even watching the game is like watching a movie it's very very cinematic and if they can capture even half of that in a sequel hell yeah sign me the fuck up
3785034	3789677	A lot of people really enjoyed that game, and I'm kind of surprised it's taken them this long to confirm a sequel.
3789737	3791658	But yeah, that is exciting news, to be honest.
3792418	3803905	Well, I think, though, with the relationship the game has with Alien Romulus, the fact that there is actually an Alien TV series, either is it already out yet or is it still in the works?
3804446	3811290	But at any rate, I think that this is a prime time, especially since we just got the Xenomorph, what, last year for Dead by Daylight?
3812888	3821299	and there are a lot more uh just you know aliens really I think being done justice lately and I think this is a a good
3823228	3824949	A good time to have this out.
3825290	3833216	And honestly enough, I try to make my brain forget that Prometheus and its sequel exist because they're stupid.
3835197	3847026	And on top of that, it totally just borked the whole retrofuturism style of the first movie and for Aliens and then some of the other in-universe things.
3848327	3850029	Romulus really nails...
3850829	3854270	what that technology looked like in universe for that time.
3855690	3859391	But yeah, but I think they're going to do it right.
3859611	3860511	I think it's going to be great.
3861131	3865752	I have nothing but positive feelings toward this whole announcement.
3865852	3866612	So let's do it.
3866772	3867173	Let's get it.
3867533	3867953	Let's make it.
3868013	3868853	Let's make it work, people.
3869173	3870273	I also think it's very interesting.
3870313	3877255	I just kind of realized, you know, coming, you know, I didn't intend to pair these things up, but I just talked about Lara Croft and Tomb Raider.
3877355	3878555	And now you're talking about Alien.
3879075	3903056	and both those series are enjoying a bit of a renaissance right now particularly through what's happening in the outside media as you pointed out with Alien and we were talking about the Netflix show for Lara Croft and the Prime show that they're doing as well and then you mentioned Dead by Daylight and I went and who came out who came out like six months after Xenomorph Lara Croft yeah it's kind of it's just funny it's interesting so
3903939	3904680	There's the cop?
3925843	3926764	Oh, I think so.
3927065	3927505	I think so.
3927686	3933413	Yeah, she's who I have as my skin for Alan Wake, but I don't really enjoy playing anybody but Meg.
3933633	3937738	Well, and then Castlevania, Jesus, they added a ton of alts for... But I mean...
3938658	3942702	Well, no, there's not really a lot.
3942802	3945105	They just did the Soma Cruz outfit.
3945645	3950990	And on the rift, if you make it into the deep rift, you get the evil Soma.
3951010	3958578	There's actually an Easter egg in there to unlock a badge for him that's like his Dracula-possessed form.
3958778	3958978	Mm-hmm.
3959939	3987519	um polyester did a video on that one recently but you have uh you have one for Simon you have one you have the the Trevor one uh you have Alucard as well and then Soma it must it must be in the agreement between Konami and Dead by Daylight that you have to release a ton of alt skins because I swear the character that had the most alts before that was Cheryl because Cheryl has you know James um
3987819	3988739	I saw the dark ending.
4012286	4014146	Oh no, I forgot that that was in there.
4014206	4014867	That's so funny.
4014927	4015947	I need to see that.
4016227	4017167	I want to play it though at some point.
4017187	4017547	It's so cute.
4017907	4018687	It's so cute.
4019147	4022668	And I ended up just like, I'm not going to get the game anytime soon.
4023768	4025909	Because, you know, I'm saving up for stuff.
4026669	4028569	So I just went ahead and watched all the endings.
4028609	4032750	They're very well done, very in the spirit of the originals.
4033530	4036311	And I will tell you this, the UFO ending is different.
4036371	4036791	Yeah.
4037331	4037892	Interesting.
4037972	4038152	All right.
4038192	4039433	I'll check that.
4039533	4041134	I do want to check it out at some point.
4041154	4041955	It is great.
4041995	4042315	Yeah.
4042415	4043576	I'm hearing a lot of good things.
4043596	4050021	And the reason why I say surprisingly is because people haven't had a lot of great faith in Konami the last 10 years.
4050141	4051161	And they earned it.
4051742	4053063	They earned it.
4053123	4054084	They're having a nice run.
4054104	4055545	The Castlevania collections have been really good.
4055785	4059347	Konami's been doing a really good job letting other people handle their shit.
4059508	4061269	And I think that's probably the right direction for them.
4061609	4065572	It'll be very interesting to see how this Suikoden thing turns out next year because I believe that...
4067953	4072935	Watch them do Metal Gear as a DLC for Dead by Daylight in the future.
4073135	4075916	You joke, but... I'm not joking, really.
4076476	4081979	I'm like, there is a Metal Gear collection that is coming, a Metal Gear Solid collection at some point.
4082819	4086320	We know that's a thing, and I think you're right on the money.
4086540	4088281	I think Snake becomes the survivor.
4089021	4090102	Why wouldn't Konami do that?
4091182	4092603	That's the most logical character to add.
4092623	4092943	I want them...
4094085	4095766	I absolutely want them to give me Richter.
4097988	4101010	Oh, by the way, can I take a quick detour on the Dead by Daylight front?
4101390	4101931	I guess.
4103152	4104473	It's also Orange Lounge Studio.
4104593	4105353	It is Halloween.
4107115	4112479	So, they had a partnership with, what is it, Madrinas?
4113019	4118183	It's like an energy, coffee, instant drink sort of company.
4119544	4119664	And
4120299	4129504	I got the Dead by Daylight collection drink that they did, and I don't like it.
4130344	4134827	It's supposed to be like a chocolate-covered orange flavor.
4137958	4139118	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
4167709	4175694	I mean, I'm not going to say it's not delicious, but it's just weird and I'm just trying to finish it up so I can put the container back in my collector's box.
4175754	4176735	I did get the shaker with it.
4177075	4179077	And I have a code for cosmetics that I already own.
4179737	4180798	Alright, fair.
4181508	4183971	Yeah, I wanted to get that out of the way since that whole thing had gone down.
4203749	4205710	Yeah, and I want to go check it out.
4205891	4207512	Because Bobby was sending me pictures.
4208032	4214837	Him and his wife, he went to one of the sushi places, the same chain out there that's doing like a limited edition.
4215257	4220340	I guess the actual sushi restaurant is a node in the game that gives you a special thing.
4220661	4223322	You can get special seedlings, I guess, like collectible ones.
4223743	4226725	And then there actually is like themed collectible stuff.
4227025	4230747	So it's interesting to see how this game stuff goes out in the real world.
4230787	4232809	But that's, you know, going back to the top.
4233149	4234610	Talk about Nintendo and Alarmo.
4234690	4237791	That's, you know, the characters.
4238271	4242073	AVIL, this is not an instant coffee.
4242113	4243034	This is a drink mix.
4243494	4243614	Mm-hmm.
4244999	4246800	Like an energy drink mix or something.
4246840	4247420	It's a powder.
4247600	4248721	It's not an instant coffee.
4249241	4256224	It doesn't really have... I've had some good instant coffees, especially some of the Japanese and Korean brands are actually really good.
4257764	4263847	This just is like chocolate-covered orange beverage with some weird coffee aftertaste.
4264647	4265027	Interesting.
4265928	4266168	Yeah.
4266748	4267028	Alright.
4267308	4270109	And it froths up when you blend it.
4270410	4271270	It's very frothy.
4272051	4272992	And Bobby corrects me.
4273032	4275074	I guess the seedling is not collectible.
4275154	4280741	It's just what they call a gold seedling, which means you only have to walk 100 steps to grow it versus 10,000.
4280841	4284645	So that's kind of disappointing because I think I have most of the sushi ones at this point.
4284745	4286166	I'll still go and check it out at some point.
4286909	4289612	Will you walk 10,000 steps and then walk 10,000 more?
4290353	4293797	I walked 10,000 steps yesterday, but I don't think I'll walk 10,000 more today.
4294438	4295499	I don't know.
4295519	4297481	I have to see how our team's doing on the challenge.
4297521	4300685	I might need to carry us again this week and go walk 4,000 after the show.
4300705	4301746	I was doing the song.
4302327	4304049	I know you were, but I took it literally.
4304229	4304429	Anyway.
4305951	4307232	That's supposed to be my problem.
4308833	4311434	I sent you a picture of the frothy drink.
4311474	4312695	I'll put it where people can see it.
4312995	4313455	Oh, good job.
4313495	4314796	Bobby finished the challenge for us.
4314836	4315156	Good job.
4315196	4315436	All right.
4316456	4321279	Loki, why don't you tell us about this very interesting thing happening on the Nintendo front?
4322096	4324098	Hey, you want to test something for Nintendo?
4324238	4326180	We're not going to tell you what it is, but you can do it.
4326360	4327081	You can test it.
4327782	4329823	Does that sound interesting to you?
4330004	4331926	Well, if so, it's too late because it's already full.
4333347	4339953	But yeah, Nintendo apparently opened up a performance test for Nintendo Switch Online Playtest program.
4340974	4345318	It's related to a new feature that's going to be coming for the Nintendo Switch Online service.
4347693	4357416	and the requirements were that you have to be over 18, have a registered Nintendo account, and active Nintendo Switch Online and Expansion Pack subscription service.
4358416	4359076	And that's it.
4359876	4364417	You don't know what it is until it leaks out later on, which it probably will.
4365537	4373219	It's supposed to be happening during the week of the 21st is when it's going live on October 23rd.
4376601	4378063	Yeah, they're all under NDA.
4378144	4381369	If you got in on that, you're under an NDA, but that's not going to stop shit.
4381429	4382811	That's not going to stop shit.
4383312	4385355	It's going to get out on that day what it is.
4386503	4410968	immediately yeah because somebody will tell their friend that's not going to tell anybody and then they'll immediately log on to social media until everybody yeah they'll just anonymously on social media and just say oh here's what it was you know screenshots or something like that I don't know why and maybe it's just because this is where my narrow focus has been recently but I feel like maybe finally all this time later maybe it's some sort of achievement system maybe
4412333	4412973	GameCubeGames
4435524	4437506	Oh, maybe like a whole other system of games?
4437626	4437946	Maybe.
4438326	4438587	Yeah.
4438747	4439107	I don't know.
4439668	4444151	I mean, that's pretty much at the limit of what the Switch can probably do.
4445713	4452999	But yeah, Wii games are possible because Wii games ran on the Chinese, the Nvidia Shield thing that they had in China.
4453059	4453939	That was kind of similar.
4454860	4455761	Ran Wii games.
4455781	4456081	Interesting.
4457342	4460104	and so that's probably the extent of it.
4460384	4462205	So maybe GameCube or Wii games.
4462265	4463746	Oh, Melee with online play.
4464306	4465407	Part of a GameCube pack.
4465547	4466587	Uh-oh, that could be huge.
4467388	4467748	We'll see.
4467768	4469229	Yeah, we'll see.
4469749	4470049	All right.
4470409	4473251	Well, stay tuned because on October 23rd, it will leak out.
4474592	4475012	Yeah, I mean, 100%.
4475052	4475452	Yeah, for sure.
4477302	4495075	All right, and before we get to the classic game of the week, again, talking about video game culture a little bit and the impact that games have on society, it's important to mention that the Harris-Walls campaign, of course, presidential campaign, Kamala Harris, Tim Walz, have launched an official Twitch channel.
4495235	4502160	Now, the fact that politicians have a Twitch channel is actually not new information because Biden's team has a Twitch channel.
4502941	4505782	In the interest of fairness, I will mention that Trump's team has a Twitch channel.
4505822	4511143	If you want to watch him ramble on and on and on at those dumb rallies, you can watch that on Twitch if you want.
4511463	4512163	They stream that there.
4512243	4513403	Actually, although he was banned.
4513443	4516744	Do you know he was banned from Twitch after January 6th and everything that happened then?
4516804	4516944	Good.
4517384	4519705	But then he was unbanned in July of this year.
4520005	4520645	Probably.
4520665	4521185	That's stupid.
4521345	4525266	I agree, but probably having to do with the fact that now he is the presidential candidate.
4525846	4526607	I'm not going to go there.
4526627	4527647	You can still ban him.
4527687	4528247	It shouldn't matter.
4528627	4535096	I don't disagree, but I'm going to go back and focus on Harrison Walls because, and it's look
4536114	4541158	I did watch some of the rally streaming for them.
4559631	4564857	And I don't believe these folks are perfect, but I believe they're the best thing we've got right now.
4565398	4568581	Especially being an LGBTQIA plus person in this country.
4569082	4573146	I'm voting for Conway Harris and Tim Walz because I believe that's the best way for my rights to be protected.
4573206	4574308	Because I can't.
4574748	4574988	I mean...
4575729	4586076	And I know there's a lot of talk right now about certain Democratic politicians and some of the frownies that they are causing with some of the things they have had to say about trans issues and so forth.
4586596	4598304	However, I believe that the Democratic tickets have been able to be swayed, petitioned, protested, and kind of come around to the right thing eventually.
4598985	4604468	Case in point, there was a time when Barack Obama did not support gay marriage.
4604748	4605449	That changed.
4606289	4609590	So my point really is that... Do not politically support.
4609610	4611291	Yeah, do not politically support.
4611311	4619754	But anyway, my point is, if Trump is elected president again, these protections are going to be actively taken away.
4619854	4626116	And it's not just the scary shit that will happen to trans people, which has happened before from Trump.
4626656	4627616	Let's just be clear.
4627917	4634379	Trump took away the right for trans people to be in the military, which is... I mean...
4636203	4646217	there's no reason to do it, none, none reason to do it, none reason to do it except to be a hateful bitch from a numbers point of view that fully weakens our military yes
4647469	4672546	but now what additionally worries me is all of this talk about drag queen brunches and you know this is now the new hot thing that republicans just want to strike down is drag brunches and i why why do they hate brunch they just don't want people to have fun that's it they want to control every everything and not let anyone enjoy life in a way that's meaningful to them it's
4674227	4676429	and I'm not standing for that shit.
4676629	4678170	That is what Trump does.
4678290	4681733	He gets up there and he just hates, hates, hates.
4682113	4685656	He's a fucking hater and I'm not voting for it.
4685796	4693542	I'm voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz because that is the option where you can actually see that there might be progress in those departments.
4693602	4695144	Again, perfect candidate?
4695224	4700548	No, because I know I'm going to get the email that says, well, Kamala is problematic for the following reasons, blah, blah, blah, blah.
4700588	4701068	Believe me,
4701829	4702529	I'm well aware.
4702770	4703550	I'm well aware.
4704170	4706692	But third party, not going to fucking happen.
4707032	4708593	She's on a felon.
4709993	4715736	The list of problematics that I have with Jill Stein is actually far longer than what I have with Kamala Harris.
4716457	4718518	I find Jill Stein to be incredibly problematic.
4718838	4725862	But what it really boils down to on that front is that when you're a third party, you do not go directly to the White House.
4726710	4736035	if the Green Party wants to be taken seriously in this country and I fully support there should be more than two political parties but you don't start at the White House you start with
4737000	4741383	A senator, a house of representative, like maybe like one lone representative.
4741403	4742424	Even smaller than that.
4742524	4743125	Or a mayor.
4743145	4745366	Let's start with mayoral races, governors.
4745927	4748229	Well, there might be a mayor somewhere.
4748249	4751431	I just don't want to get corrected on that fact, but there might be a mayor somewhere in some small town.
4751451	4752312	Why is there only one?
4752432	4752892	Yeah, exactly.
4752912	4753433	There are a few.
4753473	4758036	My point is, that is a movement that has to grow outside of a presidential year.
4758056	4766383	And as far as Jill Stein's concerned, when you don't update your Instagram between 2020 and 2024, that says a lot right there about where your priorities lie.
4767492	4771074	So I am not buying what that lady's selling, period.
4771434	4776056	So we go back to, you know what, Kamala Harris, that's it.
4776116	4777637	And I like Tim Walz a lot.
4777777	4780258	The more he, the more, you know, yeah, anyway.
4780858	4786041	I only say that because I realize I'm not, we don't have a very large audience.
4787568	4789769	or whatever, you know, we just have this little podcast.
4790109	4798493	But I do feel some type of responsibility to use this teeny tiny little soapbox that we have to say, please register to vote.
4799153	4801955	And please consider what I'm saying.
4802575	4805516	Even if I'm not going to sway your vote, just consider it.
4806136	4813760	Just consider the fact that when you are talking against drag brunches, that's actually something that I'm involved with.
4814400	4816001	Not as a drag performer.
4816741	4826551	Not brunch, but I host variety shows that have drag kings, drag queens, and drag in-betweens, what we call our non-binary pals that do drag.
4827672	4830855	I host shows that do drags of all those different types of things.
4831716	4835739	They want to get rid of that stuff, and I'm telling you, we're not out to target children.
4836877	4837717	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4856078	4858220	Oh yes, Harris and Walls and their new Twitch channel.
4858941	4865486	So what makes this one unique is that they actually were playing video games on the stream.
4865906	4870030	No, sorry, it wasn't Kamala Harris and Tim Walls playing Mario Kart or something like that.
4870390	4876896	They, of course, teamed up with Preheat, who is a Twitch content creator who is actually playing World of Warcraft on stream.
4877476	4881519	while a Tim Walz speech was occurring in Arizona.
4881659	4883340	So it was actually side by side.
4883660	4887122	You had kind of what was essentially like the vertical TikTok feed, if you will.
4887382	4888463	The subway surfers.
4888603	4890865	Yeah, of Tim Walz.
4890925	4892986	And then you had World of Warcraft going on.
4893026	4893626	And you know what?
4894127	4897389	Whatever can help reach more people, it's worth trying.
4897809	4899670	So that's true.
4899930	4903752	DarkSakura does say Tim Walz did own a Dreamcast.
4903833	4904333	That is true.
4905333	4905734	That is true.
4906584	4906844	You know what?
4906924	4910627	I want a modern political candidate that owns a modern console.
4910667	4913569	I want Tim Walz to be like, hey man, I got a PlayStation 5.
4916871	4920333	He has his own episode of Pimp My PC or something.
4921334	4921934	Pimp My PC.
4922054	4925977	He's got one of those silent systems with the water cooler and everything.
4927918	4932690	Alright, well let's travel back to a time when political campaigns were not streaming on the internet.
4932710	4935416	They were in like, I guess, IDK newspapers and stuff.
4935457	4937061	It's the classic game of the week.
4947702	4954987	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4955448	4958070	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4960251	4962593	And DarkSakura, what did you pick for the classic game tonight?
4963574	4964614	I picked Ark the Lad.
4966110	4979415	So this was a series of tactical roleplay games that were created by Tsuchida Toshiro and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment, though originally developed by G-Craft.
4981135	4987397	Each of the games has reoccurring characters and locations and an always constant timeline.
4987957	4992179	But we are going to start with the first game.
4992979	4999928	So it came out in 1995, developed by G-Craft and published, like I said, by Sony Computer Entertainment for PlayStation.
5000388	5002331	It only came out in Japan.
5003260	5011247	But eventually there was a release outside of Japan when Arc the Lad Collection came out.
5012168	5016191	I actually did import this and just never got around to playing it.
5018613	5024939	So you have an area where each of your character can go, like Final Fantasy Tactics or Tactics Over.
5026560	5051416	and you have blue tiles that you can move on that put you in range of melee attacks or distance attacks depending on what you can do but unlike something like Final Fantasy Tactics it's not isometric so you have all the tiles of the same size and shape and to use Fire Emblem as another example these are
5052739	5057544	These use fewer characters at once in a battle rather than a whole army of characters.
5059505	5064950	So outside of the battles, you have areas on the map that you access.
5066232	5074139	You have to go through and choose where you're going to go, and then you get the map of that place, and then you have to go into a highlighted area.
5075180	5076301	They prompt you to save.
5078023	5094345	you really can't select a town in this only dungeons and fields and whatnot so it was for fans of tactics games this is a good one this is one of the games that made me realize I don't like tactics games but it's a very important one
5096527	5124009	so anyway at the end of the game you can save after you beat the final boss but this save clears save data that you would do you would bring to a new game in Arc the Lad 2 so you transfer over your character stuff with your save file and I'm not going to get too much into the story
5125044	5140102	um but it's it was intentionally designed to be short um you could only access a few of the continents in this one but it expands in Ark the Lad too so they build on each other you know and uh
5142303	5145965	It's supposed to just go completely in this order.
5147306	5152409	The music in here was actually recorded by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.
5154090	5156692	The tracks in the game are sequenced
5158923	5163329	But the orchestrated pieces and the ending are streamed music.
5165171	5169576	As far as its release, Famicom Tsushin scored this a 31 out of 40.
5170958	5177126	Next Generation gave it a 4 out of 5 stars, saying that it has a deeply involved storyline and highly attractive graphics.
5177708	5179709	They're highly attractive.
5180310	5184132	And a soundtrack, quote, which rivals any big budget Hollywood production.
5185052	5189495	So in Japan, it sold 697,000 units in 1995, which made it the ninth best-selling game of the year.
5195158	5200583	The budget we released got a gold prize from Sony in May 1998, and its sales went above 500,000 units.
5200643	5203866	So overall, the game has sold over 1,587,000 units in Japan.
5216416	5219179	So in North America, you know, we wanted this.
5219759	5220259	We tried.
5220860	5223182	Two different third-party publishers in the U.S.
5224082	5232249	offered to translate and publish the game, but Sony Computer Entertainment of America refused to license the game in North America.
5232969	5237993	And there were so many write-ins, so many letters.
5238814	5244398	Finally, in 1996, they caved in and announced the game for North America for fourth quarter 1996.
5247630	5261681	and then it was you know as the date was coming on there were insiders saying that it would have both Arc the Lad and Arc the Lad 2 with the end of game save being used to unlock the second game and then the release was cancelled
5262628	5268673	but it did eventually come out as Ark the Lad Collection in April 2002 for PS1.
5269013	5276980	This is a year and a half after the PS2's October release and
5278441	5279802	The game was mostly unchanged.
5280762	5289026	The color was updated from 16-bit to 24-bit color in movie sequences, and they added DualShock Vibration.
5289527	5294709	The localization changes had them westernize a lot of names, which is kind of stupid.
5295910	5300252	Sumeria became Seria, Ramada became Amidar.
5301218	5328801	and Alibarsha became Zaraban and it sold decently it sold 51,665 units by 2003 and that's the game, Mark the Lad I have to admit it's a game that I kind of always wanted to play and then like never got around to but yeah I like that at least they're short if I ever want to play them compared to most RPGs so
5329531	5352498	well they're they're meant to I think this is like one of the early earlier examples of full-on episodic content yeah that's my thought on this without actually calling it such true true all right but you know it's it's a game that really sparked a lot of a lot of attention and a lot of desire that I think was highly mishandled if Sony had put it out when you know
5353257	5358901	When people were offering to translate and localize it, they would have made a lot more money off of it in the U.S.
5359141	5360362	Yeah, for sure.
5361703	5361983	All right.
5362043	5362343	There it is.
5362363	5364785	Your classic game of the week.
5364965	5365706	Thank you very much.
5366066	5366346	All right.
5366486	5372531	Let's move on to some rapid fire news and hit on some other headlines going on around the gaming world.
5372691	5372931	Loki.
5374005	5390043	Well, Sony just let us know that LittleBigPlanet 3 is going to be basically discontinued and delisted off of the Sony PlayStation Storefront for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4.
5391344	5393807	I guess the PlayStation 3 version is probably already gone already.
5394347	5400313	The PlayStation 4 version and the DLC for it is going to be delisted on October 31st.
5400413	5407079	So if you want to purchase that, now is the time to do that because you won't be able to otherwise.
5407620	5414806	That's kind of sad because the first two days disappeared overnight practically and that wasn't that long ago, all things considered.
5414907	5415687	So it's sad.
5415707	5415827	Yeah.
5417728	5426813	And then we got word that Goat Simulator 3 is going to be ported to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on October 24th.
5427053	5430335	So you'll be able to play those on slightly older systems.
5431456	5433537	Alright.
5433577	5434597	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
5436799	5438359	Oh, I have this and that.
5439080	5439160	Um...
5440703	5445284	So there are some layoffs happening because no one's surprised.
5445884	5451705	Cryptic Studios is laying off some staff at the end of this month.
5452325	5460667	It had already done a bunch of layoffs, but now after October 31st, there'll be more people.
5462608	5468969	I hate saying let go because they're just really being just fired because they can't afford them.
5469750	5471570	I mean, because of their own failure as a company.
5472631	5485213	So one of the character artists, Amelia March, said that she and many coworkers have been impacted by the most recent layoff and wishes the best for fellow Kryptonians.
5486994	5490435	And several people have put that they're leaving at the end of the month.
5490495	5496336	A lot of artists, they're not really saying how many,
5497216	5502064	But, I mean, this is the company that owns Neverwinter and Star Trek Online.
5503546	5504828	So, yeah.
5506570	5506891	Unhappy.
5508973	5509273	All right.
5509373	5515378	Well, in, I guess, happier news, hopefully, we have a pretty cool collection coming up from Digital Eclipse.
5515438	5519262	It's Tetris Forever, which is their Gold Master Series number three game.
5520243	5522585	And we know this is coming at some point this year.
5522625	5527469	I don't know if we have a specific date, but it's coming to pretty much all the consoles and PC later this year.
5527629	5528890	It's Tetris Forever.
5529050	5532873	And now we know exactly what Tetris games will be included.
5532933	5533334	They are...
5533874	5536775	The original Tetris from the Electronica 60 in 1984.
5537956	5540857	Tetris from the Apple II in 1988 by Spectrum Holobyte.
5541917	5546279	Tetris the NES version or the Famicom version from 1988 in bulletproof software.
5546719	5550620	Hatris on the Famicom from 1990, bulletproof software.
5551021	5555782	Tetris II Bomb Bliss, bulletproof software in 1990 on the Famicom.
5556122	5560484	We have two other versions of Hatris, Game Boy and the Nintendo Entertainment System.
5560684	5562405	Note that's different from Famicom.
5563325	5584470	Then we also have Super Tetris 2 and Bomb Bliss from the Super Famicom, Tetris Battle Gaiden from the Super Famicom, Super Tetris 2 and Bomb Bliss Genteban came out on the Super Famicom as well, Super Tetris 3 from the Super Famicom, Super Bomb Bliss on the Game Boy, Super Bomb Bliss on the Super Famicom, and Super Bomb Bliss DX 1998.
5586630	5587271	on the Game Boy.
5587611	5593298	There also is a brand new Tetris Time Warp that will let you warp through different eras of Tetris.
5593378	5596683	It looks a little bit like Tetranet, and that's what makes me excited.
5597263	5598124	Oh, Tetranet.
5598224	5598965	I know, right?
5599046	5599506	I miss you.
5599566	5601749	But it doesn't have the letters, so I don't know.
5601769	5603992	But it has that four-player well look to it, so...
5604652	5606253	Still, it looks pretty cool.
5606394	5607254	I'm very excited about it.
5607274	5617462	Of course, it's all that documentary stuff that Digital Eclipse has gotten really good at through the Atari 50 and making of Karateka and all the era they've been going through with that engine.
5617542	5620984	So I'm pretty sure the Tetris for Everything is going to be pretty sweet whenever it comes out.
5621064	5621845	I look forward to playing it.
5623166	5627269	Let's travel around the world and check out some games I'll be playing a lot sooner with world release dates.
5627369	5628410	Loki, what's coming out in the U.S.?
5628450	5629851	There are so many things.
5630251	5631452	It's that time of year, right?
5631472	5631552	Yeah.

5686043	5689145	Squirrel with a Gun on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.
5689165	5689785	Just skip it.
5689865	5690345	It's awful.
5690886	5691946	I tried to like it.
5692186	5693927	It was... It controls so badly.
5694047	5695988	The controls are so awful.
5696749	5698350	The camera... So bad.
5698610	5698750	The...
5699211	5702029	It's all bad I really wanted to like it
5702935	5705116	Like, if Coffee Stain made the game, it would be good.
5705796	5710219	Whoever made this game absolutely did not... Did you playtest the game?
5710339	5710919	It's awful.
5711199	5712320	It's just so bad.
5712720	5717122	Anyways, Wizardry, Variance, Daphne on iOS and Android.
5717322	5724606	We have 8-Bit Adventures 2 on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

5848473	5849554	Enough games, Loki.
5849634	5850014	Damn.
5850174	5850475	All right.
5850495	5851295	Just kidding.
5851556	5852196	It's that time of year.
5852757	5853417	Let's go to Japan.
5853597	5854578	Let's check out what's happening there.
5854638	5856320	Nintendo Switch on the 15th of October.
5856400	5857981	Just Dance 2025 Edition.
5858021	5860083	But it's just a code in a box.
5860243	5861724	It's literally the code in a box edition.
5861744	5862985	Just a code in a box.
5863045	5863226	Just...
5864286	5866529	I'm just a code in a box.
5866669	5866929	All right.
5867409	5869892	On the 17th, not so much a code in a box.
5869952	5871313	Super Mario Party Jamboree.
5871353	5873495	Of course, that's a worldwide release, so no surprise there.
5874316	5876698	Recklet, also out on the 17th of October.
5877759	5881402	If you want some new charging stands, there's one of those being released on the 17th as well.
5881763	5883504	That is actually it on the Switch.
5883544	5884365	That's kind of surprising.
5884385	5887108	A little slower in Japan compared to what Loki just read off.
5887648	5888348	DarkSakura, how about Europe?
5909798	5928673	so on the 15th for PC, PS5, Xboxes is New World Aeternium for the metas on the 15th as well as Just Dance VR for PS5 and Xbox also on the 15th is Girl with a Gun I wish they would just fix this it could be so good
5930395	5934417	Also, PC, Switch, PS5, Xbox Series is Neva.
5936259	5940181	Also for the same ones is Just Dance 2025 Edition.
5941062	5948387	This is the last one on the 15th is Nico Danico, The Magical World on Switch, PS5, Xbox.
5948867	5951349	On the 16th for Switch and PS4 is Crow Country.
5951889	5954912	On the 17th is Super Mario Party Jamboree.
5955772	5960475	Also in the 17th is A Quiet Place The Road Ahead for PC, PS5, Xbox.

5962977	5968881	On the 18th for PC, PS4, PS5, Xboxes is Unknown Nine Awakening.
5969521	5973484	And finally on PC, Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, etc.
5974425	5977867	On the 18th is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Mutants Unleashed.
5978367	5985392	I reckon they stopped calling them Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles like a while back.
5985995	5988088	I think they did officially finally stop calling him that.
5989468	5992349	Well, nice to get that dick out of your ass.
5993769	5999571	I think it's kind of like, you know, at some point they finally admitted the Final Fantasy games were numbered differently here in the States.
5999851	6002392	You know what Contra was, right?
6002552	6003392	Probotector?
6003652	6004653	Oh, yeah, that's right.
6005653	6008994	It sounds like what aliens do when they kidnap you.
6010254	6012455	Sorry, we need to probotect the human.
6012695	6013896	Let's go strap them down.
6014176	6018437	This is, of course, what aliens sound like translated into English with the universal translator.
6019730	6020030	All right.
6021072	6024496	Let's do a couple more news stories for you, and then we're going to get to the listener roundtable.
6024556	6025918	I think we actually have an email tonight.
6025958	6026558	I'm so excited.
6027339	6027940	Oh, yeah.
6027960	6028120	Yay!
6028180	6028841	We have one.
6029121	6030363	But we have some headlines.
6030563	6031204	Hey, I'll take it.
6031344	6031905	One's better than none.
6032325	6034228	Loki, we got a headline first from you.
6035407	6042671	Yes, so all those rumors about Red Dead Redemption coming to PC eventually finally come true.
6044072	6054058	So Rockstar Games has announced that the original Red Dead Redemption will hit PC at the end of October along with Undead Nightmare.
6054398	6058820	It's gonna have native 4K resolution up to 144Hz refresh and a bunch of other stuff.
6063661	6075846	The caveat here, and if you may remember recent reports, it's Rockstar Games is not the one doing the PC port.
6077106	6080668	It's a collaboration with Double Eleven.
6082048	6083249	I don't know who they are.
6083969	6092192	So let's just wait for the game to come out and see how good it is or if they decided to go the route of Grove Street Games and just...
6093018	6097742	Hey ChatGPT, can you like port this over to PC for me, please?
6098282	6098542	You know?
6099903	6100204	Thanks.
6102125	6102505	Oh dear.
6102666	6103026	I don't know.
6103726	6108530	I'm not in any hurry to play the older game, but it's neat that they're putting it out, I guess.
6109331	6109471	Yeah.
6111266	6111666	All right.
6111767	6118613	Well, on one final note, I guess in the spirit of the Halloween season, we can talk about the movie Terrifier.
6118693	6122296	Terrifier is, you know, I guess a newer franchise in the horror world.
6122376	6125479	Actually, I know, you know, obviously I run with a lot of horror crowds.
6125539	6126800	I know quite a bit about Terrifier.
6126960	6129042	I know these movies are not for me.
6129443	6130504	They are not for me.
6131124	6133987	I can enjoy horror movies and say I don't
6134147	6136068	Do not want to see the Terrifier movies.
6136348	6138089	They are too much for me.
6138429	6140450	Too much gore and all that type of stuff.
6140510	6141611	These get pretty intense.
6142211	6146933	But the interesting thing about Terrifier, I don't know if you all know, but the box office numbers just came out.
6147334	6149935	Terrifier 3 beat Joker this week.
6150015	6150655	Fully adieu.
6151235	6153697	That's not a high bar to clear.
6154917	6158139	I've heard stories about the intent behind that Joker movie.
6159093	6188962	yeah so and so well the Joker movie is not doing well Terrifier obviously has its fans there are people that love their gore movies and that's fine I'm not I'm never here to tell somebody they can't have what they like as long as they're not hurting anybody and movies are fake they're not hurting anybody so you know have fun I just will not be there but this could be a little more my jam because this takes Terrifier and now puts it in a pixelated video game that looks like Scott Pilgrim that
6189062	6189842	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6212353	6215995	It is, you know, an old school beat-em-up type of thing.
6217156	6224280	And Select-A-Play is the game publisher that's going to be making Terrifier the arcade game, because the character's name is Art, get it?
6225140	6228062	Being made by indie studio Relevo.
6228842	6230643	And of course, it is a classic beat-em-up.
6230783	6232404	It's got other characters.
6232464	6235366	I think Veronica is probably one of them and some of the other characters in the movie.
6236348	6243085	It's going to be out on PC, PS5, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox at some point in 2025 where I would assume at this point
6244005	6269770	They're gonna be well underway on Terrifier 4 because it's yeah that first movie was made for like a nickel and it did it didn't make a ton of money but it made enough it made its budget back tenfold then that second movie because of how disgusting it is everybody was talking about it and it just made it like the must-see most in picture so I think Terrifier 2 maybe only made like 10 million at the box office but that was on like a two million dollar budget
6270470	6283801	and now I think Terrifier 3 has like a five million dollar budget and now it's is it number one at the box office this weekend it might have been number one if Joker wasn't I think there was a lot of movies afraid to go up against Joker so that's wild
6287063	6290586	I'm more excited for the Rocky Horror Picture Show game.
6290626	6291366	Yes, me too.
6293488	6295149	Camp is my kind of horror.
6295209	6295830	I like camp.
6295890	6298411	I like Sleepaway Camp, Elvira.
6299152	6300133	That's my kind of horror.
6300153	6301634	Not so much Terrifier.
6303455	6308379	But I think it's fun that that exists and have fun if that's your thing.
6309690	6321677	Although there's still people who are screaming to have art in Dead by Daylight There were mock-ups and everything that people did trying to...
6323859	6348497	They've had that whole creative team here in Sacramento at that convention Because again, those movies took a while to become very popular And so you could get a picture with the guy in his full-ass costume and makeup if you wanted And I know people that did And now it's funny to think that now that Terrifier is a big thing He probably doesn't do that as much anymore So it's pretty wild
6348917	6352220	I mean, think about the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise.
6352740	6353120	True.
6353621	6364829	You know, as I was researching games, because I'm trying to figure out what games I want to do for my YouTube series, and I was thinking I might want to do some, you know, for Halloween week, I want to do some, you know, there's a Texas Chainsaw Massacre game on Atari 2600.
6365050	6366631	I completely forgot that that was a thing.
6366791	6367331	That costs $800.
6367371	6369813	Yeah, it's really rare.
6370053	6370594	It's really rare.
6371034	6371615	I saw one.
6371995	6373156	I took a picture of it.
6373376	6378540	It was at that and the Halloween game.
6379572	6381933	Oh, yeah, yeah, there was a Halloween game on the Atari as well.
6381953	6382793	I forgot about that.
6383294	6385615	Yeah, so I'm gonna, I'm gonna probably play some scary classics.
6386235	6389856	I will probably do the Friday the 13th NES game because I'm a defender of that game.
6390296	6395399	I think Friday the 13th NES is better than people say it is, but it has its problems, but it's better than people say it is.
6396639	6396919	All right.
6397039	6397479	Oh, God.
6397499	6402822	SS2100Matt says he apparently wants to play the next Joker, the actor that plays Art.
6403562	6404282	You know what, though?
6404902	6405923	He'd be better than Jared Leto.
6406345	6409890	Alright, let's get to the Lister Roundtable.
6410130	6411753	Once again, not a high bar to clear.
6414608	6416708	And from what I understand, the guy is really cool.
6416828	6422369	Like, you know, obviously his character is a fucking terror paralysis night demon, but it's acting.
6423009	6425690	The guy behind him is actually really cool from what I understand, what I've heard.
6425830	6426790	So, all right.
6426810	6430431	Anyway, let's get to the list of round table and you guys interacting with us.
6430711	6435012	If you have questions, you can certainly put those in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
6435332	6436772	You can also email us every week.
6436852	6439472	Participate at orange.com is our email address.
6439852	6442733	And as I teased earlier, I think we have an email, don't we, DarkSakra?
6443533	6444133	We do.
6444913	6445693	Hello, peoples.
6446294	6451795	About Alarmo, am I the only one whose deal breaker when it comes to alarm clocks is that it must be a clock radio?
6452515	6458076	I've woken up to my local radio morning show since high school and would very much like to continue doing so.
6458596	6461077	Alarmo doesn't have this feature, so I'm not interested in it.
6461597	6468678	Also, I don't like that the motion sensing feature is always on because I always feel like someone's watching me and I have no privacy.
6468758	6471619	I always feel like somebody's watching me.
6472759	6489729	Staycare Redertainment I see no point in it because I have a sunrise clock and I have an Apple Watch and I have my iPhone my system is perfect the light comes on it's like dawn in my face so yes
6492013	6492393	Don't need it.
6492433	6493654	Don't want it.
6494175	6500678	I understand there is an audience for Alarmo, and I think it certainly is random.
6500758	6501879	I don't think anybody could predict.
6501919	6507783	With all the hot takes from Nintendo, nobody predicted they're going to make an alarm clock was on their list of 2024 predictions.
6508263	6513046	But I don't hate it for people that, yeah, that works for their lifestyle.
6513086	6514587	But I'm kind of with Jamie.
6514687	6516348	I have my system that works for me.
6517829	6519570	I have my phone alarm in the watch.
6519630	6520110	And I like...
6521556	6525059	I will say this, with the watch, I like the subtle little tapping it does.
6525260	6534528	I don't know if you've noticed this, Jamie, or if yours does the same thing, but when the alarm first goes off, the watch is like, hey, hey, tap, tap, tap, tap, get up, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
6534568	6541495	It just lightly taps on your wrist for a little bit, and then the tapping gets a little more intense, and then the music kicks in if you're still not moving.
6541995	6543817	But I like that subtle wake up.
6543917	6545098	So that's, yeah, that's...
6545839	6573073	that's the system that works for me just like you have a system of entertainment with the AM radio and that's to be fair that's that's the attitude radio stations locally love to hear because radio stations have been hurting with everything on the internet and you know satellite not just satellite but internet radio and Spotify and all this that you know you can wake up to podcasts and all that now it's a weird thought to think somebody out there in the world might be waking up to this show but um more power to you if you are um
6574591	6576753	But local AM radio loves to hear that.
6576933	6585479	And to be fair, or AM or FM, sorry, whatever radio, it is kind of nice to get the traffic updates, the weather updates.
6585559	6589802	It is kind of nice to wake up and know, oh, it's going to be a jacket or hoodie day.
6589962	6593584	Or, oh, there's a 17-car pileup on the way to work.
6593645	6596727	I probably should leave early and that sort of thing.
6597327	6599309	And there are many people in chat saying,
6600089	6602110	Cats, dogs, that's the alarm.
6602630	6603790	The pets are the alarm.
6604750	6608091	And PrincePeachFuzz in chat says, do you not have phones?
6609952	6610792	Don't you all have phones?
6611832	6614193	Some people like to have an alarm clock, you know?
6614453	6616854	Yeah, it's just how it is.
6617854	6625016	You know, to each their own, or to use the whole quote as my grandma would say, to each their own, to the woman as she kissed the cow.
6627369	6633751	Yeah, S2100 Matt says, remember all the hate mail you'd get, Rob, for not getting the podcast up right away because folks needed the show for their commute Monday?
6633871	6634531	Yeah, seriously.
6635031	6638892	In fact, if I'm too late on Sunday night, I may get a call.
6638912	6644134	I don't get angry emails from the British folks overseas or anybody across the pond.
6644354	6651376	I don't get angry emails, but I will get the, oh, well, I was a little concerned because I didn't see the podcast up on the feed, so I thought maybe there wasn't a show this week.
6651456	6654037	You know, like a much more polite complaint.
6654057	6654257	Yeah.
6657461	6664023	So yeah, if I don't get the show up by midnight, my time, then I'll miss the deadline for people getting up over there.
6664163	6665323	So this is funny.
6666363	6666663	All right.
6666703	6667483	Thank you for the email.
6667503	6668544	I appreciate that.
6668584	6671764	Participate at orangelawandtrader.com is the place to send those emails.
6672825	6678386	With that, we're getting towards the end of the show, but I will check in with Loki to see if there's any last minute emails.
6679629	6703573	uh yeah i did have one thing um real quick that uh apparently limited run games has announced that they're going to be doing re-releases of all of the mainline yakuza games from zero to six and they're going to have fancy special editions i guess so pre-orders are open now or people have been getting into it since like a dragon i guess that makes sense so yeah yeah
6704811	6709053	Um, E3VL with a comment in our chat saying you should update the Twitch schedule if there's no show.
6709113	6709853	That's a good idea.
6710013	6716255	I think it's like, it's like set up as a reoccurring right now because it would be a lot to go in there and set it up one by one.
6716716	6717636	That is a good call out.
6717736	6719137	I will say, I will encourage.
6719857	6725159	This is difficult because I don't use social media or I don't use X particularly.
6725939	6726800	Um, so...
6728160	6728881	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6748724	6751726	Unless it's a... No, I don't think we've ever pinged people on the Discord.
6751766	6755808	I was going to say an exception, unless it's a dire emergency, but even then, I don't think we've done it.
6756289	6761572	So, vognetwork.com slash Discord, and if we're ever going to miss a show, we'll tell you on there.
6761672	6763553	You'll be the first to know on our Discord server.
6764133	6773859	And then, of course, if you are listening live, we would encourage you to listen to Mr. Blackwolf, who's on before us, and even if you're only able to catch the last 10 minutes of his show, he will always let you know there's no OLR on tonight for the
6780675	6791721	I think that's all I can think of for now if there's no other last minute stories to answer chat PrincePeachFuzz have you tried the new Red Bull flavors?
6792061	6802186	I don't try anything other than the regular Red Bull there's so many flavors I have no interest to try any of them I don't know, I like what I like
6803149	6803989	It's piss colored.
6804089	6805210	Yeah, piss Red Bull.
6805470	6806190	Original piss.
6806550	6807451	I don't look at it.
6807491	6808231	It's in a can.
6808251	6809331	It's in my mouth.
6809391	6810292	I don't, like, watch it.
6810572	6812413	It'll taste gross, too.
6812773	6818655	When I was in my 20s, and this is very much a when I was in my 20s story, because I don't know how the fuck I did this.
6818735	6821496	When Rob was a young warthog.
6821516	6825838	When I was in my 20s, I used to drink Red Bull and vodka.
6826738	6845562	and I don't know how like looking back I was taking literal speed ups and slow downs at the same time what was I doing to myself it's like accelerating and braking at the same time you're just peeling out it's the lesser form of taking Valium and Adderall burnout
6846735	6849676	I'll try this at home I'll tell you what I did I had a thing of the little cans and that was it
6868416	6879451	I did have, now this is like way behind the curve here, but I did finally try the video because apparently in W the fast food chain has
6881124	6902755	Captain Crunch milkshakes which don't try them they're just vanilla milkshakes with some Captain Crunch in them that's lame but what they apparently have and I did not realize that they had this probably forever now was root beer freezes which is essentially a root beer float that they blend together those are fantastic that you absolutely need to have I don't like root beer floats
6903697	6910242	PrincePeachFuzz is asking me, and I'm assuming this is a mixed drink, how many black Supermans have you had back when?
6910302	6911122	I've never heard of that drink.
6911283	6911843	What is that?
6911883	6912303	What is it?
6914685	6915866	I am looking this up.
6915906	6928775	There's a drink I used to have that, in retrospect, I think has a really inappropriate name, but it's a glass of Guinness, and you drop a shot of something on fire.
6929556	6930016	Wow!
6930076	6930597	What was it?
6931377	6933999	I mean, this sounds tasty, but very alcoholy.
6934039	6934560	What is it?
6934920	6945249	A half ounce vodka, half ounce Cointreau, half ounce gin, half ounce white rum, half ounce blue croissant, one half ounce Chambord, and two ounces of sweet and sour mix.
6947330	6951434	That sounds like an adios, but somehow worse.
6952615	6953816	And here's the thing.
6954616	6956238	I have all but two of the ingredients.
6959125	6976213	I love Chambord and I love Cointreau and I honestly think though with those flavors the gin that I have the Aoyuki gin would be really good in that too it's a strawberry gin uh so Prince Peach Fuzz I've never had that drink but I will say there is a little bar uh
6976793	6980476	Family Rainbow Bar here that I used to go to a lot more often than I do these days.
6981096	6983278	And they would sell adios pretty cheap.
6983418	6985579	I think you get adios for seven or eight bucks.
6986320	6987861	Do you remember that night I had two of them?
6988121	6988962	Oh, yeah.
6990215	6991756	Two is all you need and it's over.
6992036	6992736	It is a good night.
6992776	6995717	No, I had other drinks too, but then I had two of them and then we went back.
6995937	6997958	Were you there when we went back to Tia's apartment?
6999578	7000039	Yes.
7001139	7002159	Or maybe I was with Jessica.
7002519	7004040	No, because, okay, no, no.
7004060	7008161	Because I ate fried chicken in Tia's bed and then the smell of pot made me nauseous.
7008181	7008802	That was it.
7008882	7011823	I was going to say that was the night when everybody was smoking.
7011843	7018625	Well, not everybody, but a lot of people were smoking weed and it made me so sick and that was the night I thought I was allergic to marijuana.
7020895	7022477	I am allergic to the smoke.
7022757	7024418	The smoke will set off nausea in me.
7025539	7032886	And pod culture, the Adios motherfucker will beat a warp core breach into the ground.
7034227	7038671	And I have drunk two full warp core breaches by myself in my prime.
7039230	7041791	The first time I ever got drunk... You were there for one, Rob.
7041831	7046074	This is well documented by Travis Donovan on his old program, Under Station Live.
7046334	7052037	The first time I ever got drunk was at the Star Trek experience at the Las Vegas Hilton off of Warp Corps Breach.
7052517	7055519	So I have had both, and I will say on audios, fuck me up faster.
7056661	7083337	yeah yeah but a warp core is good we're not gonna we're not gonna say warp cores are bad because they're not it was a good drink I miss the start that is the biggest crime of humanity one of the one of the biggest crimes of humanity is the Star Trek experience no longer exists in any shape or form they could do so much with it now with Discovery and you know it's a fucking crime like put it in a universal park or something even though it's a paramount all we were missing were Morn and some drunk Klingons
7085379	7088760	Yeah, well, the Merc is still the place to get cheap things.
7089020	7090240	I forgot you were local.
7090661	7091421	That was the place.
7091661	7094922	That was the place I would go to in my 20s and get an Adios cheap.
7096222	7103024	I stopped going to the Merc when it became a little bit more... It's a tourist bar now.
7104065	7104905	Yeah...
7106451	7111914	But at least, like, you'll get a good hookup if you're not a tourist.
7113315	7116676	Once I hit a certain age, I just said, well, I guess I'm going to the bowl.
7116736	7118157	Amaretto Sours in a pint glass.
7122039	7126862	I used to go there all the time with sister stuff, but we just sort of, like, the vibe there just got worse and worse.
7126882	7130504	I was going to say, I never see them there, which is probably for the best, because...
7132593	7148440	The local group is very misogynist too Not that I should be doxing myself on air, but I go out, I do things, I'm a human being I have a drink on a Friday night sometimes Do they still have that Simpsons pinball party there?
7149566	7149966	Yes, it is.
7150146	7151327	It is Simpsons Pinball Parade still.
7152187	7153307	It needs work.
7153327	7155408	That machine needs love.
7155568	7155788	Yeah.
7156348	7156548	Yeah.
7156888	7157148	Anyway.
7157328	7157548	All right.
7157568	7158228	We should end the show.
7159829	7160369	Let's wrap it up.
7160709	7161989	Thank you so much for listening to our show.
7162029	7165510	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell a friend or two about the show.
7165550	7170151	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put on air.
7170852	7176373	A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, or YouTube, wherever you found this show.
7176753	7204723	they go an awful long way and super appreciate that let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts DarkSakura we'll start with you because I'm sure you are off to stream I am going to try Dead by Daylight tonight I don't know if I can load survivor matches if I can then I will gladly do open lobbies if not then I will be playing killer so we'll see what happens wish me luck and let's hope it doesn't fuck it up luck
7206294	7229982	alright, bye bye let's see, Loki, we're off to you, your final thought I'm forgetting to mention it for the last few weeks, but I noticed that on X or whatever that the Game Over podcast found our tweets or whatever and made comments, but they're all in Spanish so I don't understand what they're saying
7230748	7232349	I don't know if it's positive or negative.
7232429	7235189	I'm assuming positive, but we'll see.
7235309	7239711	Not if they maybe take issue with some of the things we said on the show, but it is what it is.
7239771	7240511	I'll go look it up later.
7240531	7242232	No, it was just announcing the stuff.
7242632	7244613	It didn't seem negative, but I don't know.
7246113	7247794	Okay, I'll go look it up.
7247854	7248614	Yeah, Google Translate.
7248654	7249894	I'm surprised you just didn't.
7249954	7251955	Doesn't Twitter even have the Translate thing built into it?
7252668	7256550	It does, but I didn't want to just go by whatever they said, you know.
7257010	7257231	Okay.
7257871	7258151	All right.
7258992	7269798	Then my final thought will be... My final thought is, well, number one, I should have shouted out Bear Dive as a local spot earlier because they are a great little joint here locally.
7269838	7271318	So I need to make sure they get their shout out.
7271699	7275361	And then my other shout out will be congratulations to the winner of Big Brother.
7276121	7279104	A show that I hate to admit that I like, but I do.
7279304	7281546	I won't spoil it for people that haven't watched it yet.
7281586	7286150	But it's the person that won I kind of thought was going to win for quite some time.
7286310	7287411	So congrats.
7287572	7287852	All right.
7288713	7289353	That's it.
7289814	7290374	We're done.
7290454	7291415	We're out of here for the night.
