10006	11167	And that's how time works.
39298	41799	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
41839	46520	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46700	48961	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
49021	57904	We are live tonight, October the 27th of 2024, with episode number 1022 of our show.
58744	66126	Totally not with a false opening, as we do tape live at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vognetwork.com.
66547	71874	Every Sunday night live, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show.
71954	77903	And we are here, myself, Rob Roberts, and my co-hosts, starting off with the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
79252	80112	I have a new costume.
80312	80992	You did.
81012	82773	You had a little Star Trek red shirt thing.
82813	89895	I was lightly, I don't even want to say making fun, but I was poking fun before the show because I was like, well, you don't want to die on the show tonight.
89935	90615	Don't be a red shirt.
90635	97676	But I was thinking original, but then I turned out that that was actually one of the squirts from the later series.
97736	98777	So I was like, no.
98817	104758	Because then it would have been like science bath soap.
105174	106855	Now you've changed to a different type of red shirt.
106875	107496	Actually, no, I take that back.
107596	112239	TNG would have been... It's not the red shirts in TNG.
112279	112979	It was the yellow.
114180	115661	Yes, starting with Tasha Yar, yeah.
116061	117863	So, but... Well, no.
118303	120124	She was not the first yellow shirt to die.
120144	120644	No, she wasn't.
120684	130291	But anyway, I was going to say, now your VTuber is wearing a different red shirt of sorts where you kind of look like somebody that went to Rocky Horror Picture Show last night that I was hosting.
130691	132132	You look like one of my audience members last night.
132152	133393	It's an 801 Resident Evil 6.
133533	134334	Is it really?
135459	136540	I wouldn't have guessed that.
137140	137561	Okay.
138121	138662	Interesting.
138722	143766	I mean, I have a Rebecca, but there's something a little bit wrong with the model, so I changed.
144326	145467	I wouldn't play that one.
145867	149931	And I have a Jill, but it's like Resident Evil 3 boring Jill.
151432	152132	It's a good outfit.
152212	154754	It's kind of giving college goth girl vibes a little bit.
154955	155335	I like it.
157012	158954	Well, that was absolutely not the vibe I was going for.
159955	160736	But I liked it.
162057	162397	All right.
162838	164239	It's Halloween after all.
165520	168063	And I hope everybody had a good Halloween weekend celebrating.
168183	169564	Actually, I want to ask you about this, Jamie.
169604	176611	Didn't you say something about you were going to the coin-op downtown this weekend and you were going to wear a costume?
176751	178653	I thought I saw this on Blue Sky somewhere or something.
178673	180074	I drank too much.
181415	182517	Aw, you changed your outfit.
182537	184979	I didn't mean to go that far.
185099	186441	Well, it's okay.
186501	187202	I have my kitties.
187482	187662	Yeah.
189274	192396	Anyway, I went to Coin Op.
192576	195217	I went dressed as Amanda from Saw.
195938	197279	As in the first movie outfit.
197639	202763	Because it was already part of the special cosmetic that came with the crown and everything.
203503	213029	So I just left off the DVD stuff and went there and I was like, what do I have that's red that I can just rip all over the front of this?
213450	217793	And I drew on little marks for having the trap and the mouth and everything.
218873	238311	and and it was it was good and then I found someone who was dressed as Carrie and so I got the red makeup all over my arms and I was like well that's actually okay um but we we had a good time and I'll get to the games I played later all right sounds good well then we'll head on over to Tech Master Loki hey Loki
239141	239321	Blue.
262308	271571	I was looking into how to get it so that our domain shows up, but I'm just going to leave it as it's complicated and I probably need Jason's help in order to do it.
272631	276312	Because I think I could have done it in my... Here's the funny thing.
276452	283294	Our registrar has me... I have had this orangeonstrater.com so freaking long.
284278	291959	that the registrar actually has my old email address on my custom domain, which was Sky, a name I don't even use anymore.
292059	294920	Sky.cx used to be my custom domain forever.
294980	296920	And I don't even know if they sell CX domains anymore.
296960	300741	It was like, you know, the alternatives to .com and stuff like Christmas Islands, I think it was CX.
301121	303061	So I used to have this domain years ago.
303441	305602	I haven't had that domain in at least a decade.
305842	308602	But unfortunately, my registrar says, oh, you want to reset your password?
308622	309543	I'm going to send the email here.
310123	311363	So I'm like, oh, son of a...
312063	325483	Even though, like, it's weird because I actually set it within my registrar's system that has my correct and current address, but because orangetonsradio.com is tied to my sky.cx address...
326266	327027	I can't change it.
327627	328968	I'm sure there's a way to do that.
329008	338435	Yeah, I probably just have to email support and just be like, yo, it's me, I'm the logged in customer, clearly, but I can't change the email address and I no longer have access to this domain.
338795	339155	Help.
339796	340576	So, we'll see.
341517	341817	Anyway.
342437	343158	We'll figure it out.
344179	344259	Um...
345416	346377	But what was I going to say?
346457	351262	Oh, yes, since you are on Blue Sky, I saw... Did one of your kids dress up as, like, an inflatable chicken?
351462	352503	Like, what was that all about?
353084	356327	Yeah, it was their Harvest Festival thing that they do at school.
356607	362634	So he dressed up like... He wanted to dress up like a giant chicken because...
363254	367198	Well, first he wanted to dress up like Skivity Toilet, and we said no.
368279	374284	And then, so he dressed up like a giant chicken, because other kids in his class were also doing similar things.
374324	384754	So, one of his friends did a giant flavor rubber chicken, and then there was another kid, I think there was also another giant chicken, and then somebody dressed up like chicken nuggets.
385254	385595	I don't know.
385855	386636	They were all themed.
387336	388457	So, we did that.
388477	388898	Okay, sure.
390472	391873	Did you dress up at all?
392153	392333	No.
392754	394995	Do you plan to for Halloween this week?
395796	396336	Probably not.
397677	402080	It's a bummer your Sackboy costume from Little Big Planet is no more.
402100	403421	Oh yeah, I threw that away.
403681	405782	I threw that away, unfortunately.
405822	407624	Who knows how many spiders were in that thing?
407704	409285	It was in the garage for a while.
409625	412467	There's probably all of the spiders in that.
412927	413768	Little Spiderboy.
413788	416790	It is just not worth...
417802	418983	Show me that on my face.
419463	422686	No, you have to have a lot of raid to make that safe again.
423407	435516	Yeah, so, and then, yeah, no, unfortunately I'm celebrating this week by my day job asking me, or forcing me, to come into the office for three days for literally nothing.
436897	440100	It's such a waste of time, so I get to do that this week.
440280	440881	Fun!
441161	442001	Well, have fun with that.
442021	442622	Yeah.
446162	450526	Let's get into tonight's kickoff topic and talk about what is going on in games.
451167	455410	And lots of people talking about this because this is some unfortunate, sad news.
455570	457072	Jason kind of referenced it in the intro.
457112	460975	It's an unfortunate side effect of working in the gaming industry as we have yet more.
460995	464819	Well, they're not saying layoffs this time, but we're hearing about a team that got disbanded.
465439	466940	Loki, can you give us more insight?
467020	470282	What is going on at Ubisoft this time?
470602	493697	The Prince of Persia Lost Crown team unfortunately the game apparently didn't meet sales expectations and so they disbanded the team and are moving them to work on other projects so one of those projects hinted at right now looks like it could be a Rayman game
494611	500876	of some sort, but apparently no sequels to this game, which I think has actually got reviewed pretty well.
501417	503699	I just don't know what they were expecting
505807	506868	How it to sell.
506928	513872	I mean, like, I don't know what they were expecting either, because I don't know if y'all know out there listening and so forth.
513932	519996	But this game was not available on Steam when it came out, which is the largest, you know, PC platform.
520396	522417	I'm not even sure it was on Epic Games.
522457	523518	It might have been on Epic Games.
523758	524478	I don't remember.
524899	531703	But basically, Ubisoft wanted you to have the subscription to their platform to get this game.
531723	531883	Yeah.
533103	534944	So they kneecapped it from the beginning.
534964	535545	Yes, they did.
535845	536625	Yes, they did.
537086	541168	And so this is yet another case of the developer didn't do anything wrong.
541208	543269	It was the publisher that made all the mistakes.
543489	546271	And we've unfortunately seen this a lot in the industry.
546671	549833	And I'm thinking back to Mass Effect Andromeda.
550733	569027	I'm still a little salty over that because remember that game got absolutely hosed because EA insisted on charging, overcharging for the early access and the people that got into early access were a bunch of the clout chasers that were seeking the bugs to put the bugs on full display so that way people cancelled their pre-orders of the game saying it's a buggy mess.
569795	579418	when, yeah, the game did have issues, and I'm not excusing the fact that those games had issues, but the game should have not come out for another six months.
579498	592123	I'm not arguing that point, but the game would have done a lot better if, A, the publisher hadn't forced the original release date, B, sold the early access so all the warts could be on full display, and it just goes on and on.
592623	621364	and the sell early access is kind of dumb anyways especially in this day and age because we're very I mean we shouldn't expect it but it is the reality that a lot of these games get pushed out without like the proper day one patches or just with like a lot of stuff that needs to be fixed because they are rushing them out for a lot of whatever sales numbers you know they're trying to hit their quarterly numbers or whatever the case may be
622217	649069	and I don't know I was thinking about this earlier today gaming has become too corporate is really kind of what it comes down to it's like you know all these discussions that we have with like studios being disbanded layoffs and all the monetization and stuff it's just too corporate it's not like you know where oh this game got reviewed bad it was just it's now it's like well it got reviewed well it's just you know it didn't make the
649844	657110	Billion of dollars that Ubisoft wanted or they didn't get people to sign up for their stupid subscription plan that no one wants.
657230	658912	I don't know.
659332	660053	It's really dumb.
661464	667066	Record WN in chat says, I got it on sale from Best Buy for $35 within a couple months of release.
667086	669266	That might have been a better price for most to take a chance.
669886	671347	Thank you for highlighting another issue.
671387	675908	The game was too damn expensive for what... Are they selling it for $70?
676808	679629	I don't know if it was that high, but I think it was at least $50.
680629	684190	You know, for the type of game that there's many alternatives available for $19.99.
685470	687751	Game pricing is another really weird point.
688191	689772	Yeah, it's hard to figure.
689792	691632	I mean, I'll admit it's not an easy.
691672	692673	Okay, record confirms it was 50.
692753	696154	I admit this is a hard thing to figure out.
696274	698875	What game should be worth 70 and what game should be worth 20?
698915	706318	This is not an easy issue to figure out, but I'm going to tell you not every game is 70 like some publishers want it to be.
706679	711781	There's a lot of nickel and diamond a lot more out of that game to get your 70 eventually.
713359	727206	The $70 should be like... We should see a mark... The level of quality of the game needs to be miles better than a $60 game.
727526	729407	And same with other stuff.
729527	733449	And I don't think... I think it's whatever that it'll sell as, obviously.
733669	733989	Because...
735401	740302	I don't know, like, there's a lot of games, though, like, you and Madden and stuff, where they're charging $70 for that.
740682	742262	That game wasn't worth $70, it wasn't worth $60.
743623	747583	And, but they're doing it because they're like, oh, well, it's so expensive to make these games.
748023	749784	Yeah, that's not really true.
749844	758825	I mean, yeah, it's expensive to produce it, but you're also making, you know, you want everybody to forget about the billions of dollars that you're making off of DLC and microtransactions.
758865	761666	Like, it's like, oh, we're so poor, you know, but it
762990	791085	you're not like it's it's just it's very they just want more money because you know infinite growth and you know that's totally realistic I just I don't know and it's unfortunate but you know what I think is good about this at least it doesn't sound like people were laid off and if they were if some layoffs were to happen like later on you know hopefully a talented team like this could pivot this into you know
791385	797571	Well, it should be the publishing team that made the decision to... Nobody should get laid off.
797871	799212	The blame is never in the right place.
799673	801194	Yeah, let's be realistic here.
801254	803296	They're never going to take the blame for their mistakes.
803677	805698	That's corporate.
806039	808281	They can make all the mistakes that they want.
809022	810022	And, you know, the...
810703	811503	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
833351	859142	it's probably going to happen just because they're corporate and they are going to try to make their investors happy and that's all they care about they don't care about you the the end user of said product they don't care about the development teams they want their investors to be happy and unfortunately it's just it you know you just have to vote with your wallet and you know if you want lost crown just get it on deep discount um
860367	887861	because I mean there's no sequel anyways but like what I was saying earlier though is if those layoffs eventually happen you know hopefully a team like this could pivot this into something like you know a game that's without the Prince of Persia IP and maybe an independent a new IP that has the same type of gameplay you know a la the you know Castlevania's and the Mega Bands you know maybe not my number nine but you know what I mean
888784	892186	Fifth Dream in chat says, it makes me appreciate indies even more.
892306	897028	Like when I was on Blue Sky praising a game and the dev found it and thanked me.
897508	910995	Yeah, I mean, I know I've talked a lot about Blue Sky on this show, but humor me because I'm going to talk about it a little more because it really is feeling like some of the older days of cool social media because I'm having the same experience where the devs are very accessible to me.
911175	926218	and as long as you're not a total a-hole which you know most people that are you know fleeing over to blue sky are pretty cool um as long as you're not an a-hole and you treat people worse but you probably will get some interactions especially with some indie devs i had the same thing happen so the um
927139	929860	The Rocky Horror Show game came out this week, right?
930360	930961	Oh yeah, yeah.
931041	936263	Yeah, so it came out on Steam and I think Itch and Nintendo Switch.
937003	938024	Itch and Switch, Itch and Switch.
938364	941485	But it did not come out on PlayStation yet, which is kind of what I've been waiting for.
941565	943306	So no, I'm sorry to say I haven't played it yet.
943406	947368	However, I posted some type of bleat that was like, I'm...
947808	949690	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
969383	982475	The developer of the Rocky Horror Show game replies to that bleep and goes, Seeing that gif makes me think I really want to do a Showgirls game next, but that IP is probably impossible to get.
983336	987740	And I was like, you don't know unless you try.
987760	989142	Did you see the sequel?
989682	997227	Now I'm like, number one, you're cool as fuck for not taking my thing personally and actually responding with my dream game right there.
997567	999428	And so I was like, well, you don't know unless you try.
1000049	1001009	You got to go for it.
1001129	1004452	And I want my game to push F to throw french fries dramatically.
1005012	1006553	And we ended up having a little back and forth.
1007033	1008254	And now we follow each other.
1009095	1012817	And I'm like, that's the cool part about Blue Sky right now.
1012897	1018621	Again, your big devs aren't going to be on there, but some of your indie devs are on there and probably enjoying
1019634	1022677	Not having a bunch of dickheads coming into their replies on everything they write.
1023438	1026521	There were some big names already on there when it was still invite.
1027041	1028723	Yeah.
1028903	1031185	A few of the Star Trek people got in, I noticed.
1031506	1033748	I think they passed invites around to themselves.
1034308	1040735	Jerry Ryan, Stashwick, LeVar Burton has an account too, but some of them haven't used it in a long time.
1041095	1044359	I don't think LeVar Burton uses this account since he first established it.
1044399	1053269	One of the things that sucks, and I'm assuming it's the same with other fandoms as well, is there was a lot of Minecraft creators that on Blue Sky people were...
1055378	1059902	They were holding their domains, you know, just in case they came.
1059922	1061023	They didn't want anybody taking them.
1061063	1063565	But then there's also people like, yeah, you can have back for 50 bucks.
1064365	1066947	It's like, that's the worst.
1067047	1068188	I hate that kind of thing.
1068288	1068868	That's terrible.
1068989	1069269	Yeah.
1069289	1069589	Domain.
1069609	1072971	There's a big reason why DarkSakura.com is never going anywhere.
1073031	1073552	Just saying.
1074366	1076467	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1104786	1106728	And on Instagram, I don't even know who has it.
1106768	1112552	I think an actual person has it on Instagram, but some people also use the same nickname, so it is what it is.
1113453	1115054	But on Blue Sky, I got it.
1115494	1116895	And Linktree, I got it.
1116955	1120758	So some websites, if I'm fast enough, I'm able to be the first Rob Roberts, which is nice.
1122898	1123178	All right.
1124638	1128019	Anyhow, it's a bummer to hear that that team disbanded.
1128179	1129299	I think they got a raw deal.
1129419	1132260	But yeah, like you said, I'm glad it's not layoffs.
1132360	1137641	And I really hope that doesn't mean it's not layoffs until next week, which would be really shitty and terrible.
1139142	1139462	But yeah.
1139842	1145103	Well, no, it sounds like they were reassigned to other projects because they needed help on other projects.
1145143	1148784	So being that they're not greenlighting a sequel...
1150069	1151110	which is understandable.
1151150	1155553	I mean, the the the company has a choice to not make a sequel to something.
1156234	1162838	And they always reevaluate that later on to, you know, that at least they're working on something else.
1162978	1166381	And it sounds like it could be like a Rayman game, which is also cool, you know?
1166641	1183189	but it also shows that the game did not like even if they were to invest and do a different thing with that same group in that same vein or you know whatever it's still it's a lack of faith from Ubisoft at the top that what they're going to make next is going to sell because Prince of Persia didn't sell and that has nothing to do with the developers
1184113	1191379	and everything to do with that bone-in choice to put the game on the Ubisoft streaming or the Ubisoft subscription thing, which nobody cares.
1191660	1193942	Nobody cares about Ubisoft's subscription.
1194122	1194742	Nobody cares.
1194782	1197485	That's also like a January release too, I think.
1197645	1199486	It came out like a while ago, so.
1199586	1202969	I don't think that, I don't think the calendar hurts that much.
1203510	1205552	Maybe a little bit, but I don't think it hurts that much.
1205592	1207874	There's been games that have come out in January that have done just fine.
1209724	1214574	Alright, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and what games we have been playing this week.
1214975	1216959	DarkSakura, you were teasing us a little bit with your trip.
1218036	1219157	Oh, I played a lot.
1220839	1221460	Let's see.
1221480	1229448	Well, of course I played Dead by Daylight now that it's working again and have just been basically memeing around and encouraging others to do the same.
1229688	1231770	Is it working again because of your ticket?
1231810	1235314	Like, did they do another patch or did they just never really respond to you and suddenly it works?
1235334	1237796	I have no idea what it was, but it works.
1238317	1240539	Because keep in mind, I never see updates anymore.
1242921	1267616	updates are all done on their virtual server that makes sense you don't ever have to wait for a patch that makes sense okay yep all right and so um but i've been i've been enjoying that um making friends you know taming killers that kind of thing um and uh i i think i've been doing nothing but dead by daylight this week because of the twitch fright fest
1270226	1275550	Um, I've also been playing a Suika game.
1276871	1282494	I also went to Coinop, which is our local barcade.
1283295	1293041	And in this house, we feel a certain way about how they treated a friend of ours who supplied pinball tables and did other things.
1293722	1296124	Oh, is this why they don't have as much pinball as they used to?
1296184	1297985	Because I noticed that last time I was there.
1298760	1300002	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1316125	1340145	um I played also uh Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles the four player Konami classic with Danielle and um I played some crane games and some skeeball I was like on my skeeball game I got like the five thousand dollar like high one like four times in a row and I was like
1341116	1342217	When was I this good?
1342237	1346159	I think I've always been decent at skee-ball, but that was on my game for some reason.
1349260	1350221	What else did I play?
1350241	1359145	I think that was about... Oh, and Giant Jenga, if we play the semi-Giant Jenga, which I'm apparently really good at when I'm really intoxicated, so go Fig.
1361567	1361947	And then...
1364511	1390065	that's what I remember playing but there were some good costumes also there was a Ryu and a Chun-Li we had Speed Racer we had a horde of Mandalorians come in like of just different characters um I'm trying to yeah it was just really really fun um
1391772	1392693	That's what I played.
1393433	1394274	Sounds like fun.
1394394	1398317	You had Halloween costumes and video games combining and alcohol.
1398918	1399558	Responsibly.
1399839	1400199	Important.
1401780	1403702	So it sounds like you had a winning combination there.
1404803	1405183	Yep.
1405984	1407084	Alright, well we'll go over to you, Loki.
1407125	1407685	How was your gaming week?
1408636	1423779	it's all minecraft again yeah um so this week uh we had uh we did like a little bit of a halloween thing i didn't stream it but i participated in it so it was like a halloween event a little bit smaller than what we normally did uh so we did like a
1425606	1431908	They had different games that they were playing in the beginning, which I didn't really get to participate in a lot of because I had family stuff going on at the same time.
1432508	1442031	But then we did a Halloween trivia game that was kind of... Or Halloween trivia, like quiz... I don't know.
1442331	1445092	It was similar to what we did at Christmas last year.
1445992	1448693	And that was put on by Justix, and it was...
1449393	1449733	Awesome.
1450933	1451754	So a lot of fun.
1451794	1459595	We had some guests from the Unorthoblock server, and we had RusticDragon from Autocraft, so that was pretty cool.
1461456	1463796	And then, yeah, I've been working on the theme park stuff.
1463816	1471137	So I have the boardwalk pretty much... It's all designed... A lot of it's designed.
1471197	1473538	I'd say it's like 85% done.
1474138	1478659	And then two Redstone minigames that are completely...
1479776	1480083	Built.
1481486	1482026	Design.
1482086	1488171	So I'm rebuilding them now on our actual survival server.
1489211	1496317	And I've been working on just kind of rebuilding everything I designed on the creative server on the survival server and filming that and stuff.
1496337	1500040	So just working on getting an episode out hopefully this week.
1500100	1503242	I was trying to get it done last week, but it took a little bit longer.
1503682	1508146	Redstone recreating, especially those minigames, takes a lot of time.
1508826	1509147	And then...
1510984	1514087	Yeah, so I'm hopefully going to get that out later this week.
1515168	1527300	And yeah, it's like two attractions and two rides because there's also a merry-go-round that's functional and an alright roller coaster.
1527360	1527981	It's basically a
1530231	1530592	and more.
1543137	1569432	now I could be reading into this wrong but I feel like you've been kind of leaning more into like the amusement park ride thing in Minecraft in the last couple months is this because those videos seem to be gaining more traction it might be kind of like oh no it's my theme this season no no my my channel growth is flat if not negative I thought you were getting uh some good views on some of your no no the algorithm hates me uh it's fine it's just what it is um but no it's
1570272	1598286	it's just uh you know it's not getting traction or anything so that's not why I'm doing it it's just the the theme I've yeah it should be fun most of all right yeah yeah and and it's it's nor nor am I trained to like so uh one like big creator comparison is uh Scar uh Good Times of Scar from Hermitcraft who did uh Scarland which is essentially like Disneyland it's his take on that and so he did like a Main Street and then he had like uh
1600000	1600800	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1617186	1622150	The castle, while really nice, isn't necessarily a ride.
1622170	1627153	It's not functional in the sense that you can do anything there other than look at it.
1627654	1632837	And so I decided to take the approach of making the park much smaller.
1632917	1636900	Kind of think of a regional theme park.
1637981	1644485	Aside from Disneyland, which has a ton of attractions, your average small theme park...
1645649	1646590	Thanks for watching!
1665305	1694100	that uh I guess it's like a midway carnival game the one where you roll the balls into they have like a bunch of holes and then you're racing there's like a race horse going across yeah I used to love that one yeah yeah yeah but skeeball yeah it's sort of it's not quite skeeball but it's like skeeball yeah um I crossed that with a basketball game it's like it's Plinko skeeball sort of yeah yeah it's so it's if you get it into on that one if you get it into like a a
1695216	1696217	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1709622	1710722	Thank you for watching!
1726688	1730930	Each basket you sink moves your horse across until it gets to the end.
1731510	1733591	And then whoever wins, you know, wins, obviously.
1734391	1735912	So that's one of the games I have.
1735972	1744796	And it sounds like simple, but like to build the system so it all doesn't break and it, you know, doesn't like have two winners or something like that.
1744996	1749117	It's quite complicated to keep it that small.
1749277	1751538	And so I built that, which was really cool.
1751858	1755280	And then I have another game that's kind of like that.
1756788	1759251	Pop the balloon out of the clown type thing.
1759791	1762794	But there's no balloons, obviously, in Minecraft.
1762814	1765336	So instead, you're throwing snowballs at a target.
1765816	1770500	The more centered to the target you are, the faster the lights go up.
1770580	1776345	And so the trick is you're constantly throwing snowballs and having to manage, you know, because you only have 16 in a stack.
1776846	1781550	You have to manage, you know, switching between your different slots and keeping that cursor centered.
1782210	1806930	and then whoever gets to the end then you know first wins and so there's it's kind of a similar type of gameplay so those are the two mini games I have and then you know a working merry-go-round which surprisingly was harder to do than I thought because minecarts don't like to cooperate and then yeah then the roller coaster is just it's kind of like the last roller coaster I built but yeah we got a the drop tower ride was also fun too
1807861	1808482	DarkSakura.com
1819850	1823853	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1848637	1854759	My gaming week, of course, like usual, I've been playing way too much Diablo 4, but I'm just so it's so good.
1854839	1857699	Like, I really like the balance of endgame activities in this expansion.
1858480	1859740	There's no shortage of things to do.
1859860	1860820	I've been really enjoying it.
1860880	1864621	So I'm up to like, I think I'm at Paragon level 135 now.
1865101	1868442	So, you know, that any indication how much I've been playing.
1868462	1871843	I mean, some Twitch streamers I watch are well into the 200s at this point.
1872223	1874244	So I don't play that much, but I've been playing enough.
1874924	1897442	so I've been playing that and then of course continuing on my retro gaming adventures so I thought this week I would get my revenge on Mario because last week did not go well for me on stream and I forgot to use A and continue and I lost all my progress guess what happened this week I started playing Mario 3 because I was like alright I'll just start at 3 and go backwards I started playing Mario 3 and I fat fingered
1898223	1903106	Using the warp whistle, even though I was intending to play the game completely through.
1903267	1904808	And at that point, I was screwed.
1904908	1908390	Because when you warp from World 3, you can only pick 5, 6, or 7.
1908670	1912273	And I was in hardcore mode, so there's no save states or anything.
1912773	1916375	So I did a reset, and I did it the quick way.
1916475	1917196	I warped to World 8.
1918257	1920858	And when I say quick way, it still took me an hour.
1920938	1923580	Because, man, was I suffering in World 8.
1923620	1923680	But...
1924901	1948506	I got through it eventually and I beat it so that's that was kind of fun so I did that and that YouTube's up and then I did some other um retro look back to my channel I played a game called was Cosmic Ark this week I think it was I think I did Cosmic Ark this week on the Atari 2600 which is an interesting um like two board game where you have like the up down left right uh to destroy the meteors and then you go abduct aliens off the planet it's a really cool concept
1949166	1950067	Yars Revenge for the 2600
1969534	1970655	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1990993	2001277	Yeah, the Excitebike, I actually, you know, even if I didn't quote-unquote beat Excitebike because I couldn't beat the part-time on the last stage, I felt like on those first few stages, I was flying through.
2001317	2004338	I was like, I'm muscle-memoring my way through Excitebike.
2004358	2005398	This game is fun as fuck.
2005478	2008499	Like, once I can remember, like, what I'm doing, it's pretty, pretty cool.
2008660	2009220	So, well, thank you.
2009240	2012861	Yeah, DarkSakura is saying, Rob's definitely better at Excitebike than I am.
2012881	2013361	Well, thank you.
2013441	2016803	I don't always feel good at video games, even if I comment on them a lot.
2017203	2017503	But, like,
2018604	2035301	Well, it's funny because I was watching someone else play Excitebike, and I'm going to be very vague because I'm not trying to be that guy, but in my head I was like, I really want to tell this person that they could improve their scores if they would lean the bike forward and not lean the bike backward.
2036182	2037664	and I don't want to be that guy.
2037965	2044212	So I just, you know what, I'm going to go play the game myself and say, well, okay, Hotshot, if you think you're so good at the video game, go play it.
2044512	2045113	And so I did.
2045193	2051120	And I, you know, again, the leaning forward was working for me on the earlier tracks, but when we got to track five,
2051761	2054003	I can't figure out a way to get the part time.
2054183	2059289	I'm going to have to memorize that track's layout so I can optimize using the heat strips and all that stuff.
2059349	2064294	But everything else I breezed through is just the very last stage, which also, by the way, is gray on gray.
2064794	2071180	So it's like you have a light gray track and you have dark gray puddles and dark gray things.
2071561	2075345	And somebody in chat, I think it was Bobby, said something that is probably true.
2075905	2079247	The effect was probably not as bad on CRT televisions.
2079667	2083169	But when you're playing it in an... Yeah, he said it again in chat there at VOG Network.
2083709	2093834	But when you're playing it on an emulator or on your PC or on a more modern monitor, it's very difficult to see the obstacles on the track.
2094395	2096516	But yeah, on a CRT, it probably looked fine.
2096976	2102839	So it's one of those interesting sorts of... Sometimes technology makes the old games harder.
2103059	2103560	It really does.
2103880	2104000	So...
2105700	2108375	I'm figuring out what game, what retro game I'm going to take on this week.
2108476	2109039	I think...
2110216	2112018	This might finally be the week for the Guardian Legend.
2112218	2113259	I'm ready to take that one on.
2113639	2115561	So I think I'm going to do Guardian Legend on stream this week.
2115861	2120466	Because, I mean, like, I can't not play the Guardian Legend.
2120486	2123308	Like, it is one of my favorite Nintendo games of all time.
2123368	2125150	And, of course, I'm going to sit here and go, it's my favorite.
2125190	2125490	I love it.
2125530	2126551	And then I'm going to stream it.
2126892	2128834	And I'm going to be such shit at it.
2128874	2129975	Don't cry to me.
2130155	2132697	I'm going to be such shit at that game.
2133078	2133638	But it's fine.
2134319	2135099	Because you know what?
2136260	2138321	Sometimes it's just about going there.
2138581	2140122	I was also thinking an RPG.
2140182	2142903	Like, I'm kind of itching to do Dragon Warrior.
2143563	2146384	You know, Dragon Quest when it was new as Dragon Warrior.
2147585	2147925	We'll see.
2148285	2148585	We'll see.
2148745	2149505	Maybe I'll do that next.
2150066	2150306	All right.
2151946	2155588	Let's move on with what else is going on in gaming news.
2156268	2157468	This one made me laugh, Loki.
2158949	2160210	I mean, I don't know.
2160250	2163151	Maybe this is the team that they got transferred to, but...
2165632	2170461	Yeah, so Ubisoft, there's more news regarding Beyond Good and Evil 2.
2171262	2172845	Apparently the game is still...
2174107	2175527	Happening, I guess.
2176808	2183130	So the last thing that we heard was that the creative director, Emil Morrell, passed away back in June 2023.
2184830	2189632	And since then, they hadn't had a person fill that role of creative director for the game.
2189752	2192092	However, now they have.
2192372	2196954	So announced on his LinkedIn page, Fozzy
2197774	2203158	Mesmar has taken over the creative director role on that game.
2203538	2209983	Says I've been working with those peeps for years now on this ambitious game and witnessed their talent firsthand.
2210364	2214947	I'm standing on the shoulders of creative giants that supported the team before me.
2215087	2219531	I look forward to continuing to craft a game that is truly unique for players to enjoy.
2220391	2232620	He has worked at Ubisoft for a bit and on some pretty big games, so including the Mario and Rabbids Sparks of Hope, Star Wars Outlaws, and the Beyond Good and Evil 20th Anniversary Edition.
2233381	2241606	So, um... I'm just still surprised that the game's alive and still going, considering that, what, first down is 2009, and then...
2244540	2265648	reintroduced again like kind of like hey it's not dead uh back i'm not dead yet 17 it's just it's uh is this another duke i mean yeah it's doing forever and it's a longer cycle about like not meeting expectations i don't understand how this could possibly meet expectations after
2266668	2294358	and essentially 16 years of development well and here's the thing like every other game that's been in a 10 plus year development cycle beyond good and evils is that what this really is this is an announcement that has been rebooted i know they're i know they're not saying it i know they're not but this is an announcement that they've restarted development at some point you know maybe not like necessarily today but at some point last year or so they have restarted development because obviously how many different fucking systems have they targeted throughout this
2294858	2316944	so I mean it's been a while look at Final Fantasy 15 very clearly a game that restarted development two years before the end Duke Nukem Forever clearly restarted development I mean that's a that's not even a secret they've said they restarted development several times during the cycle that I mean that would have been start it would have started off like you know Xbox 360 PlayStation 3 era
2320022	2325210	and if, yeah, yeah, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 era.
2325511	2326933	So it might make PlayStation 5.
2326973	2327815	Two generations.
2327995	2328216	Yeah.
2330128	2330508	Maybe.
2330528	2332949	It's been several generations already.
2333189	2334230	Good point by SSJ100.
2334590	2337352	Matt, Metroid Prime 4 was restarted at least once.
2337552	2347877	Yes, and I fully believe that teaser was to kind of shut people up and that they're hiding a lot because there's going to be things with the next Nintendo console in Metroid Prime 4.
2347937	2348598	There has to be.
2348918	2349478	There has to be.
2351394	2359081	There's... Without fail, every Sunday, I get past some story about rumor of Nintendo announcement coming this week.
2359141	2365626	And there's another one that they're saying, like, these sites in Brazil that have a good track... I'm over it.
2365746	2367127	Like, it'll happen when it happens.
2367848	2369249	Yeah, when there's an announcement, there's an announcement.
2369269	2371351	I don't need to know when there's going to be an announcement.
2371451	2372612	Like, that's not news.
2372812	2374974	Unless it's Nintendo themselves.
2375054	2377436	If Nintendo themselves says...
2378337	2382929	We're putting it on the table on October 31st or whatever, then great.
2383209	2384392	That is news.
2385558	2385978	Finally.
2386659	2386899	All right.
2387279	2389901	Well, speaking of Nintendo, why don't we move on to this story?
2389961	2391181	Because this is really funny.
2391261	2399607	Because, you know, remember when everybody had to apply to be in that beta test and it sold out in seconds and you couldn't apply to be in it?
2399807	2404790	But you had to sign an NDA or agree to an NDA or something to be able to get into this?
2404810	2406211	I don't even think they have an NDA yet.
2406251	2407251	No, it was under NDA.
2407291	2410993	You were under an agreement and Nintendo can basically...
2412028	2439889	cancel your account or whatever if you catch you but we're like that's not going to stop the minute this thing hits we're all going to know what it is and you know what actually the surprising thing was it didn't happen the minute the software hit it happened before because it was data mined once people were able to download it what the hell is going on with this so the Nintendo Mystery Project is apparently what they're calling a Minecraft like MMO
2440889	2461273	so I don't know if that perks your ears up Loki a little bit but I don't think it's like literally but apparently the goal is you work with others to develop a expansive planet by using creativity and farmed resources as you progress you get new lands, new enemies, and new resources for your journey isn't that Dreamlight Valley?
2462179	2465342	Potentially, you know what this, well, let me get back to it.
2465362	2466063	Let me read the rest of this.
2466083	2466943	I'll tell you what I think this is.
2467564	2468945	You get tools called beacons.
2469326	2472428	The beacons do a healing light that purify and develop the land.
2472769	2475712	The higher you put your beacon up, the wider area purifies.
2476552	2479975	When you're in your beacon zone, you can move, lift, and edit items.
2480396	2486722	And then in that zone, you can create platforms, stairs, Minecraft-like blocks, trees, and other items.
2487082	2488322	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2516495	2516796	Okay.
2517676	2519878	And then you have what's called your DPS.
2519978	2521780	Not a GPS, but a DPS.
2522140	2524042	Your Development Positioning System.
2524543	2531209	Of course, in a Nintendo creative Minecraft-like game, I'm sure DPS is going to be dicks per second that get drawn in that world.
2533519	2550331	but fine, DPS Development Positioning System is a special skill and it allows you to see the development status of the planet and the position of other players you can create content for the game but you have to get a UGC license to do so essentially to prove you're not going to start drying dicks everywhere
2550851	2552132	to create UGC.
2552172	2560959	You must obtain a UGC license by taking a test in the game to show that you understand the importance of respectful communication.
2561259	2568664	So, not only does it sound like they're ripping off so many things, and I hope lawsuits come their way, just, you know, just out of karma's sake, you know.
2569425	2571206	Um... It...
2573092	2574153	No, you know what this is?
2574573	2575514	No, I don't want to.
2575654	2576595	I'm going to tell you what this is.
2578176	2578716	I disagree.
2578856	2583600	I think it's exciting that Nintendo is finally getting into this because this isn't Minecraft, it's Fortnite.
2584280	2596329	I think this is Nintendo's foray into realizing that there are all these, finally realizing there's all these always online, always present systems and they are not in on that.
2596369	2597870	This is Nintendo's version of Fortnite.
2598610	2600232	and do not misunderstand me.
2600612	2604456	I am not saying this is Nintendo's version of Fortnite Battle Royale.
2605036	2607519	What I am saying is this is Nintendo's version of Fortnite.
2607679	2608420	There's a difference.
2609641	2612023	Fortnite creative mode?
2612143	2620451	I guess you could say that way but this is them wanting to create that because you bet if this thing and it's probably not in the game yet but there will be
2621192	2626575	Things akin to Battle Passes, especially when you hear like mini games to help you level up in this other world.
2626675	2628837	They're trying to create that always online thing.
2629037	2630138	This is Nintendo Fortnite.
2631598	2635321	It's just... It didn't make sense when I first heard it.
2635421	2640024	I was like, when I first heard it, I was like, I don't know what this is going for.
2640124	2642405	And then when I read it again, I was like, oh, aha.
2642905	2646788	Nintendo is testing the waters on their own Fortnite without using Mario yet.
2648223	2656369	Like, I understand, like, okay, so I understand, you know, taking the test and getting a license or some stupid thing like that.
2656409	2657690	Well, it's not going to stop anything.
2657730	2658910	It's not going to stop anything.
2658950	2661592	It's not going to stop anything.
2661792	2670138	And also, it's just, it sounds to me like, it's like, okay, you don't have a very good content moderation system.
2670738	2673821	Like, because you could just put that in the terms of service or something like that.
2673881	2675722	And so it's like, you know, you know that
2676260	2682805	You know, little Billy, that it's inappropriate to draw genitalia out of blocks in this block game, right?
2683986	2684747	It's like, no kidding.
2684767	2686328	They know that it's inappropriate.
2686348	2687910	They're not going to be like, oh, please?
2687970	2688830	You know, like, I'm sorry.
2688850	2691012	You're not going to be educating a person on this.
2691593	2695196	I just think it's... Okay, sure.
2695596	2696857	Sure, let's see them do this.
2697457	2699599	But then again, I swear, if it gets...
2700765	2701846	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2719779	2725442	But when it comes to the content, because I do think they should, I think they should have gone after Palwar a long time ago, quite frankly.
2725903	2733167	But when it comes to, and because, and to be clear, specifically on the fact that those are Pokemon and Palwar.
2733207	2733787	On the models.
2734107	2735448	Like, you're not going to convince me otherwise.
2735488	2736268	Those are Pokemon and Palwar.
2736288	2742252	The monster models or something like that, not because they're like, well, we own the rights to capture things in a ball.
2742632	2743472	I'm sorry, no.
2743633	2745514	Here's where I'm going to agree with you, Loki.
2745814	2746014	So...
2746655	2747175	Hold your breath.
2747576	2752784	So here's where I'm going to agree with you because I do think this is the type of thing.
2753044	2755208	Why did Fortnite get popular?
2756590	2757591	Content creators.
2758493	2758893	Twitch.
2759861	2785655	YouTube that's why for and why did Minecraft get popular content and I get I get that if Nintendo does not learn how to treat content creators and to foster that environment this game is going to backfire and they're going to wonder why are we not getting success with this game because you're not allowing people to create content for it the way they want to create content I will agree that is going to be a challenge for Nintendo that I'm not sure they're ready to meet
2786812	2805947	I just don't trust that they will because aside from just suing people for different things like playing their games on there they have that whole system where they're like, yeah, you should pay us to play our games we should get a portion of your content revenue it's like, excuse me?
2806327	2806988	I'm sorry?
2807788	2808128	No.
2808608	2809349	No, you shouldn't.
2809749	2812329	Like, that is such a backwards approach to it.
2812430	2816091	And I don't trust them to do the right thing.
2816491	2819252	Because I don't think they've learned their lesson.
2819292	2820872	It doesn't sound like they've learned the lesson.
2820952	2823113	Nothing makes me think that they're going to learn their lesson.
2824022	2840228	Now here's, and I haven't even gotten to the part where I disagree with you, and it goes with a comment in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network where SGO100Matt says, This sounds like a strange swap mix of every trendy top game of the past five to ten years, and I'm going to say it doesn't matter.
2840768	2841348	and DarkSakura.com.
2865589	2866009	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2880731	2885497	But Nintendo sure perfected the platforming genre, and every platformer aspires to be a Nintendo game.
2885897	2892765	So all I'm saying is, I think until we see a little more, I mean, we'll see how liberally it's borrowing from other games.
2892785	2896289	You're going to need a lot of faith in this to be like, I'm...
2897430	2913760	I feel Nintendo's track record speaks for itself and I'm willing to wait and see their track record in embracing current technology nope and then again the content creation part and being able to be always online and on the internet that part does concern me um so in that way it's a test
2914660	2923445	But I'm not going to write it off just because it's inspired by all these other things because Nintendo is going to put Nintendo's, you know, nice shiny coat on it.
2923765	2926667	And I think people are going to be there.
2927087	2927607	Well, we'll see.
2927668	2928028	We'll see.
2929068	2929288	It is.
2929509	2930529	I will say this, Loki.
2931790	2932450	It's interesting.
2932490	2933511	They're testing it at all.
2934031	2934972	Nintendo doesn't do this.
2936130	2949809	and this is why Nintendo doesn't do this because now we all know about it but Nintendo doesn't do this and so it's very interesting we'll see I'm very curious not super excited about it
2951612	2955375	Bobby says, I like how we're all like Nintendo keeps doing the same thing over and over.
2955436	2956496	We want something new from them.
2956857	2960900	And now we're like, we hope you get sued for doing something different than anything else you've done before.
2961240	2962121	It's not though.
2962601	2965243	It's not that they're doing something different than they've done before.
2965283	2968366	It's they're doing something that basically everybody is doing already.
2968506	2969307	Like that's the problem.
2969647	2972369	It's not like they came up with this brand new original concept.
2972389	2976072	They're like, hey, let's take this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, and just mash it all together.
2976592	2977293	And yeah, sure.
2977553	2979515	I hope that it's successful for them.
2979835	2986659	But also at the same time, I kind of hope that maybe there is a lawsuit thrown their way because they have been so litigious against everybody else.
2986779	2988240	It's a little bit of karma payback.
2988520	2996905	Like, once again, Nintendo only tries when they get their comeuppance, and they haven't had their comeuppance in a while.
2997245	2998485	So it's about time.
2999666	3004809	I'm just saying, love them, but they're not innovative until they're pushed, and pushed by failing.
3007303	3009724	I just don't see where that is going to be the issue here.
3010144	3010625	I just don't.
3010845	3014948	I think it's going to, especially because they're testing it, it's going to be polished.
3015088	3016048	Everything's going to be fine.
3016509	3024194	Yeah, the ingredients might be inspired, but sometimes you can make a lot of things with flour, eggs, and the basics.
3024894	3027096	And it just depends on how you blend them and how you put them together.
3027216	3031579	And I'm not worried that Nintendo's final product is probably not going to be something interesting.
3031779	3036162	But again, if the part is that they're leaning into something online,
3036782	3061782	that's the part that Nintendo's track record and how they deal with online communities and how they deal with online products at all not good so that's the part where I'm like I don't know right because if they can't execute on that well they're not going to replicate what happened with Fortnite or what happened with Minecraft because they're going to alienate the content creators that's it we'll see what they put up all right uh let's move on we got another story this is another huge story going on in gaming DarkSakura
3063166	3066188	Yeah, um, this.
3069350	3077056	I have ever been so much at a loss for reading something that you still don't know how to verbalize it.
3079682	3080682	Emails from my ex.
3082283	3084084	Mom, this is less hilarious.
3084244	3086765	Okay.
3088945	3105831	The US Copyright Office basically proved that they're very well swayed by money and that the industry is working against game preservation in its entirety.
3106972	3107072	Um...
3108720	3122024	Basically, the preservationist groups have lost their campaign for right to study vintage video games that are in U.S.
3122144	3122724	libraries.
3123284	3123824	Remotely.
3124584	3130986	Like how you would get an e-book for research purposes for free through certain education channels, right?
3134107	3134447	They...
3135945	3142988	I mean, but they're saying that this is going to violate copyrights.
3144629	3154253	Basically, the Video Game History Foundation and Software Preservation Network have been fighting this for three years to get an exemption to the rule regarding old video games.
3155814	3159956	They said that they should be able to access emulated copies of their games remotely.
3161497	3162457	The same like ebooks.
3163037	3163738	But...
3166148	3170270	I'm just going to read the quote directly, if you don't mind.
3170930	3172090	This is from their statement.
3173451	3178713	Lobbying efforts by rights holder groups, and they added in that one among that is the ESA.
3181324	3182344	were behind all this.
3182964	3183665	So here's the quote.
3183745	3195530	During our hearing with the Copyright Office, the Entertainment Software Association declared that they would never support remote game access for research purposes under any conditions.
3196190	3204054	The game industry's absolutist position, which the ESA's own members have declined to go on the record to support,
3204614	3213901	forces research to explore extra-legal methods to access the vast majority of out-of-print video games that are otherwise unavailable.
3217344	3222869	And we are dealing with an endangered market of games.
3223829	3229954	Many already completely lost to time and unavailability, right?
3231616	3231896	So...
3234005	3238989	I'm just... Number one... Go ahead.
3240070	3245093	I was just going to say that like Commodore 64, Rob?
3245694	3246014	Of course.
3246334	3249817	Only 4.5% of its libraries are still in print.
3253376	3273385	87% of games released before 2010 are in that category if you're looking at Game Boy games 5.87% of Game Boy titles are still officially available yeah only 13% of classic games are available to be played but are they cool with that?
3273545	3273685	no
3275959	3277159	Delusional
3304210	3304650	Delusional.
3304710	3305050	Delusional.
3330259	3340061	So you have asked them to turn to piracy because as Jamie just pointed out with the numbers from the study, there is no other way to find 95% of Commodore 64 games.
3340321	3342602	You must pirate them at this point.
3342782	3343902	I have two words.
3345002	3345903	Civil disobedience.
3346903	3348903	Well, I get it.
3348923	3351324	So every time I pirate a game as an act of civil disobedience.
3351524	3352704	It's an act of protest.
3352884	3353444	Here's the thing.
3354064	3355985	And I want to draw a very clear line.
3357423	3360065	I don't support pirating new games at all.
3360606	3362407	I don't support pirating modern games.
3362808	3365570	I don't support pirating things that are available on the market.
3366031	3366971	Do I emulate?
3367011	3370775	So this week I did a thing on Yars Revenge, right?
3370815	3372096	And I used an emulator to do it.
3372196	3373357	I'm happy to say that.
3373777	3377280	Do you know how many times I have bought Yars Revenge legitimately?
3377661	3378221	How many times?
3378261	3379682	Because I support Atari.
3380183	3381044	I bought Atari 50.
3381804	3402249	I have one of those Atari 2600 consoles I you know like so yeah if I want to play the game on an emulator I'm gonna fucking do it because I know I also support the legitimate releases of these titles at darn near every opportunity for these types of things like when I was playing uh Dracula X for uh for um
3404299	3415991	I have the game the translation was based off, I have the voice acting in that game, I also have the original Japanese version, and I have two PlayStation copies.
3417755	3427420	Let me finish my thought before, Loki, you jump in here, because what I want to say about the whole piracy and all this, I say there is no other choice but to pirate those games.
3427960	3432982	Technically, because I'll get corrected on it by an email if I don't say it, you can still go.
3433042	3436124	You can travel to the physical library and go do it there.
3436384	3437865	So hooray, you can do that.
3438705	3439886	But do you think students...
3440606	3442308	Who are the most likely audience for this?
3442328	3447753	Do you think students are going to have it in their budget to go hop on a plane to go visit a place for a couple days to go work on their paper?
3447993	3449174	No, this is not realistic.
3449474	3454799	What pisses me off about it is that video games, as an art form, are being treated differently
3455620	3456040	DarkSakura.com
3485684	3486224	It's money.
3486565	3496951	It pisses me off as a gaming fan time and time again that people are this obtuse on the whole situation, including the worthless ESA.
3497811	3500853	Sorry, Loki, but I needed to finish my thought or I was going to burst.
3500973	3502794	So, Loki, what would you have to say?
3502814	3510959	I was going to say, in the case of playing The Guardian Legend or something like that, I could essentially loan you my copy that I actually have a physical copy of.
3511019	3511640	I have a physical.
3511660	3514101	I bought a physical copy of it when I was in New York City for 30 bucks.
3514321	3518104	So I feel no shame about playing that particular game.
3518545	3522868	But if you think I'm going to spend hundreds of dollars to play, no, I'm going to pirate it.
3523149	3523869	There comes a point.
3524149	3527993	And with the Guardian Legends specifically, it's something about that particular game.
3529251	3538558	Any other problem you deal with is that for people who don't have older TVs or any of the proper conversions, you're dealing with things like input lag.
3538578	3541461	You're not getting the same experience playing off of the original hardware.
3541721	3542421	Hold that.
3542642	3543943	Underline that.
3544383	3547245	What did I just say about SightBike like 10 minutes ago?
3547785	3548506	What did I just say?
3548946	3551248	It's different now on an emulator because it's not the same.
3551288	3552089	It's not a CRT.
3552889	3553130	Yes.
3553490	3554170	Yes to all of that.
3554290	3554411	No.
3555293	3583397	some of us have CRTs and can hook up to that but anyone would be hard pressed to find one what am I going to do if the tube blows I'm sure I could find someone but I don't know who can repair it I can get myself a record player but I can't get myself a CRT TV my Astro City is like that right now plus I want to point something else out too if you're telling me Rob if you want to play these games on emulators you should go get the legitimate copy let me ask this
3584704	3589606	How much money did Broderbund... You already know where this is going.
3589786	3592408	How much money did Broderbund get when I bought that cartridge?
3593048	3596690	How much money did the publisher and the developers get when I bought that cartridge secondhand?
3597350	3599911	The only money they got was the original purchase of it.
3599951	3604313	That's right.
3604333	3611957	Which was why a lot of places were trying... Some companies were trying to stop the resale trade as well.
3611977	3612357	Mm-hmm.
3613544	3622329	even though for some companies that's how they make their money I mean I think that's pretty much where GameStop was making their money was the resale market yeah
3623789	3642848	So obviously, I'm glad this isn't permanent and it can be re-approached in three years because hopefully as government employees retire and new ones come in who have maybe grown up around video games, maybe we'll get some sense in there.
3643749	3645230	It's interesting because politically...
3645851	3666511	Today, AOC, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, did a stream with Governor Walz, who obviously is running for vice president, and they played some Madden, and they played, kind of like a joke, at the end, they leaned into the Tim Walz Dreamcast memes, and Tim Walz played Crazy Taxi.
3667091	3667211	Yay!
3697111	3704755	If Sega didn't re-release Crazy Taxi on Xbox or PC or whatever, because I think he was complaining about the controller.
3704795	3707276	He's like, well, the Xbox controller is different than the Dreamcast one.
3707456	3708817	Because he wasn't doing very well.
3709337	3715380	It's almost like he hadn't played the game since 1999, you know, or whenever he last touched a Dreamcast.
3717061	3723684	So, but, you know, if Sega hadn't had a version of that available...
3724622	3726603	They wouldn't have been able to play that at all.
3726683	3733466	They wouldn't have been able to lean in that meme because you're not going to catch a vice presidential candidate using emulators and all that stuff.
3733566	3738108	But thankfully, Sega re-releases their old games.
3739309	3739569	Anyway.
3741910	3743611	I did think that was really cool, by the way.
3743731	3745652	And it is always nice to see
3747405	3752388	Um, politicians playing video games, you know, and I've said this many times on the show.
3752528	3756810	I learned this a very difficult way by having an ex who was a politician.
3757170	3761172	And that rule is any fucking idiot can be a politician.
3761472	3764954	Trust, trust anybody.
3765014	3769136	You sitting there listening to this, you have exactly what it takes to get into politics.
3769516	3770056	Trust me.
3770656	3771037	Trust me.
3771137	3774478	Someone way more clueless than you has run for office.
3775159	3775679	I dated them.
3781672	3800705	so I just hope the right people start getting into the right positions to start making changes but you know at least this is something that can be re-approached in three years but three years seems like a long time how many games will be pirated yo ho ho by students ESA good job on that anyway moving on Loki maybe some more pleasant news for us
3802131	3815882	Yeah, we can talk about Sakurai and his YouTube channel, which is now, he's kind of done with his video series and basically saying that, hey, guess what?
3816342	3822047	It was mostly pre-recorded, which I guess is surprising to some people.
3822487	3827611	What I was surprised with is how much he said it costs to produce the content on his channel, which was $600,000.
3827651	3828092	That seems a bit...
3831818	3859111	I don't know I mean I understand you gotta pay salaries of people who are editing and working on the videos and all that stuff I guess some of those licensing costs almost feel like that might have been exploitative that seems awfully high you know as someone who licenses music on the regular and stuff it seems awfully high yeah
3859764	3871332	Anyways, the other surprise is that he's actually been pitching a new project back when the channel first started, and he is able to move forward with it.
3871352	3883059	He says, I received a request to write a game proposal, which I finished at lightning speed, and I'm sorry I can't share more about this project, but assuming that we're able to get it made, it should be announced sooner or later.
3885101	3885221	So...
3886212	3890213	I wonder if people are going to jump to conclusions that it'll be with the new Nintendo system announcement.
3890413	3891894	Because this is oddly timed.
3892574	3895435	Or is it the game that you're beta testing right now?
3895895	3896415	Is that it?
3897296	3898656	Is that Sakurai's game?
3898816	3899996	I doubt that that's Sakurai's game.
3900177	3903158	That feels too experimental to be his game.
3903318	3904278	Almost too experimental.
3904838	3906499	I'd love to be wrong, but I don't think so.
3907419	3907499	Um...
3908888	3910229	whatever he wants and we will support it
3938801	3943344	In fact, go help pay for all those people that worked on the videos.
3943584	3946185	I'm sure he's made a lot of that back already.
3947106	3952629	He has millions of subscribers across his two channels and over 80 million views.
3952869	3953250	That's good.
3954911	3958593	I think he's probably recouped a lot of that.
3958713	3958873	Yeah.
3960592	3960972	Let's see.
3961192	3961873	I wanted to go back.
3961933	3967955	Sorry not to belabor the emulation story too much, but this is a really good comment in chat that I missed when we were talking about it.
3967975	3968675	I want to read it now.
3969276	3981080	So Questbuster in chat said, as someone that has used emulation to research extremely old titles from the early 80s and even the late 70s, it's an extremely important tool for accessibility.
3981580	3988583	I don't have my own access to a Plato environment, but thanks to an emulated terminal, I can get to one maintained by volunteers.
3989483	3990404	I mean, case in point.
3991044	3998728	You know, emulation is not just about downloading, you know, old school 8-bit Nintendo and Sega games.
3998888	4000489	I mean, yeah, sure, to some extent.
4000950	4010715	But it's about even systems you can't play anymore because most of the systems don't even work or malfunction or have ceased to, you know, they've disappeared.
4011676	4013236	So I think that's a very excellent point.
4014297	4015718	You can't even research old systems.
4017319	4017559	Silly.
4019636	4020897	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4037967	4044449	Konami in the last year or two feels very different than Konami five years ago, or I guess I should say pre-COVID Konami.
4044869	4048650	It really feels like they've evaluated some things and they're in a different place.
4048670	4049690	Figured out some stuff.
4049750	4052111	Yeah, and they're licensing some things appropriately.
4052411	4057953	And we kind of knew already, like, okay, Konami's not going to go after vampire survivors because they licensed Contra to it.
4062955	4066137	Vampire Survivors is getting the Ode to Castlevania.
4066497	4069399	It is going to launch appropriately on October 31st.
4069419	4070739	Over 20 new characters.
4074381	4083905	all of the Belmonts, Simon, Richter, Trevor, Sonya, the Belmonts, Sypha, Yoko, Charlotte, Aline, Maria, Renard, all in it.
4084305	4088947	Other heroes, Jonathan Morris and John Morris, both in the game.
4089428	4093950	New weapons, whips, spells, projectiles, more whips, glyphs,
4096499	4114851	and a lot of really cool 8-bit sounding classics like Vampire Killer, Bloody Tears but these are remixes that are done by Vampire Survivor composers Danielle Zandara and Filippo Virarelli and some fan favorites as well so this is really cool
4116607	4118069	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4131687	4157203	but um I may have to check out this Castlevania DLC I'm really uh I'm really excited to check it out so you know what good on Konami and I still haven't played the Silent Hill 2 remake yet sorry I do I do want to get around to it um maybe in the next couple weeks appropriately for the season but then of course you know then we get the Suikoden remaster next year which I I hope is going to be good and maybe dare I say Konami is back dare I say
4158547	4164148	By the way, speaking of old school Konami, you could tell during the intro tonight that Jason was on the road, right?
4164168	4165928	Because you could tell he was on his muffled microphone.
4166569	4171310	And we appreciate that Jason is that dedicated to do that shit even when he's on the road.
4171890	4174950	He does not like to fly, so he drives to a lot of different places that he goes to.
4175570	4176871	And he sent me pictures.
4176971	4187813	I had no idea that this was a thing going on, but he sent me pictures of Naoki, yes, that Naoki from the DDR days, DJing some sort of dance or rave.
4188573	4190514	And I was like, is that Naoki?
4190554	4204459	And he said, yep, in Vegas And so it looks like there was some sort of thing called Red Note Because I can see all the merchandise in the background that has arrows on it So I guess there was some sort of DDR convention, tournament, get-together type of thing called Red Note Or is that the arcade?
4205179	4209120	Is that the arcade in Vegas?
4209240	4212722	Weren't they going to open a music game arcade there in Vegas?
4212762	4216023	It was off the strip That sounds cool if they were going to I didn't know anything about that
4217012	4217513	Oh, it is.
4218213	4219274	Oh, it's not a convention.
4219314	4220375	It's the actual space.
4220715	4222857	Holy shit, they must have gotten Naoki to DJ there.
4222957	4223757	That's incredible.
4224138	4229502	Yeah, so that was the... Okay, so I remember this coming up on the show a couple years ago, so I guess they opened now.
4229842	4233725	I went to their website, rednotelv.com.
4234185	4239670	5,000 square foot arcade facility dedicated to playing rhythm and music games located in Las Vegas.
4239850	4241131	I know it's not on the strip.
4241971	4242071	Um...
4243252	4244332	I don't know where this is at.
4245913	4248413	I'm trying to figure this out relative to the strip.
4252974	4254094	Oh, it's nowhere.
4254634	4256034	Well, it's to the west.
4256875	4261015	It's way to the west of the stratosphere down Oki Boulevard.
4261375	4262536	So like way over there.
4263116	4266576	So way, way over there is this place.
4266676	4268937	And I guess Naoki must have been DJing there.
4268977	4270457	I'm trying to look at their calendar real quick.
4271843	4277687	Red October 2024, the premier Step Maniacs competition held at Red Note.
4277807	4279809	Aha, that's what it is.
4279929	4281530	Oh yeah, I played that too.
4281650	4284412	Yeah, Naoki's been doing all that collaboration with Step Maniacs.
4284452	4286914	In fact, I think the latest pack that came out was like all his stuff.
4287254	4288435	So that doesn't surprise me at all.
4288995	4289596	That's awesome.
4289696	4290436	Yeah, that's great.
4290456	4291637	Glad to see that game's doing well.
4291757	4292838	Yeah, how'd you like it?
4292858	4294439	I had that at coin-op.
4294799	4297081	I couldn't hear any of the music, but I did really well.
4297421	4298042	Hey, good job.
4298963	4301645	I mean, for having several drinks in me.
4302787	4303507	Yeah, and the music.
4303527	4305189	And breaking into new pair of Doc Martens.
4305349	4305970	Yeah, yeah.
4306570	4308412	Yeah, Matt says that is a ways away from the Stratosphere.
4308432	4313678	Yeah, like, I know I said, like, it's west of the Stratosphere, but I mean, like, miles west of the Stratosphere.
4313778	4317061	Because, yeah, you have to go way down the road there.
4318072	4322475	Alright, so I guess that's where Jason went, was to go to that Step Maniacs competition.
4322515	4323956	That's rad, though.
4324517	4326898	The photos of Naoki, I was like, fuck yeah, that's awesome.
4327499	4327879	That's cool.
4327919	4331502	I'm glad to see he's still making music and having a good time, so good for him.
4332102	4335665	Alright, let's move on to people having less of a good time.
4336745	4337306	Are we on Loki?
4338086	4338647	No, we're on Jamie.
4338687	4339007	I'm sorry.
4339848	4340208	Are we?
4340728	4341128	Yes, we are.
4341469	4343890	I get to say something.
4343951	4344711	Well, okay.
4344831	4345832	You can say something any time.
4347063	4369360	anything remember everybody has a voice that's right you just have to use it well except me when I woke up this morning anyway um so you know the whole thing how Netflix was gonna make money uh by making their own games and they took back a bunch of their licenses and everything remember that it failed
4370529	4371110	And you know what?
4371812	4379508	The studio known as Team Blue that was supposed to
4382407	4386009	Go in and really turn things around.
4387791	4400079	They had some ideas for doing these huge multi-device games and being ambitious and focused on their mobile units.
4401459	4404241	They made some really big hires and everything.
4405582	4407343	Including, like in 2022, they got...
4410285	4417911	They were trying to get Chaco Sunny, the Overwatch executive producer, and did.
4419653	4423916	He also worked on Call of Duty and Santa Monica before that.
4427018	4431782	But this Team Blue is no more.
4433363	4433984	They got shut down.
4435509	4461901	that's unfortunate but you know it's well and those hires those big names that they got they were already gone oh so they had already left and so maybe there wasn't the glue there to hold the rest together I get the impression that's what happened it could be that they just didn't stay for their positions at Netflix interesting
4463092	4488766	I wonder if Netflix wasn't giving it the proper I mean there's so many angles you can sort of read into this and you know it's all just trying to guess it's all crystal balling but you gotta wonder if Netflix just wasn't giving it an appropriate amount of resources maybe they thought oh we can hire these big names and they'll just come in and presto change-o they're gonna make a game but if they weren't supported appropriately then they probably got fed up and left or if they were facing the wrong type of resistance and all that stuff
4489880	4519135	well I mean they got the other people mentioned in this is Joseph Statton who was the creative lead on the Halo franchise and he was supposed to be a creative director for one of those big games they were thinking of and then they also had Raphael Grassetti as art director who also again worked with Sony Santa Monica and he was the God of War art director
4520724	4528132	Those are some really big names from really big talents and then to just fuck it up, you know, say, okay, we're not doing this anymore.
4528233	4529854	I mean, I'm sure it was a longer time coming.
4530575	4540446	I got the thought that it was going to be eventually shut down when Dead by Daylight got the Stranger Things license back.
4542955	4546698	and it proved they never took out Larry's.
4547098	4547519	Not Larry's.
4547539	4548259	Why did I say Larry's?
4548559	4550621	The Hawkins map.
4550821	4551522	Hawkins map, yeah.
4553763	4558867	Alright, well I always thought they'd just reskin the Hawkins map to not be Hawkins, but hey, glad they got the license back.
4560909	4561870	That makes one of us.
4563071	4563951	I'm kidding.
4564131	4567814	I'm glad they got the license back, but Hawkins is still a pain in the ass map.
4567874	4568495	But not that map.
4568675	4568935	Alright.
4570096	4570957	Loki, what do you got for us?
4571786	4573628	I got some fantastic news for you.
4574189	4574610	Can't wait.
4574650	4576352	See what I did there.
4576692	4577473	Fantastic.
4577733	4578374	Remember them?
4578635	4584262	Last year they released a game, if you will, called The Day Before.
4585209	4610815	um in which you know it flopped for being a bait and switch and an absolute waste of money and then everybody got refunded and all that stuff and it yeah and it was bad and they didn't pay people and all that fun stuff well uh then you may remember they came back with a kickstarter for a game called escape factory which looked like fall guys um
4611809	4611969	Oh, yeah.
4636231	4640513	Yeah, and so also along with that, they've wiped their X account.
4640993	4642174	I'm sorry, I'm going to call it Twitter.
4642374	4644996	We're not calling it X. Or maybe we should call it.
4645176	4645496	Who cares?
4645576	4645936	No one cares.
4646777	4651380	They wiped their social media accounts so they can move everything to Discord.
4651400	4657243	They also removed their apology that was on there as well.
4659625	4661606	And yeah, a lot of the other information about the games.
4663373	4664333	Why won't they just die?
4664653	4667694	All I have to say about... I have one thing to say about this.
4667994	4668114	One.
4668594	4669394	Stick to crypto.
4671895	4681797	Yeah, and honestly, at this point, if you're going to trust this studio any further, you're just asking to be ripped off at this point.
4681817	4684038	With all the scams that they've tried to pull recently.
4685178	4685678	Just don't.
4685838	4686598	Take it from me.
4686898	4690439	I was dumb enough to back the Amico, and even I'm not dumb enough to back this.
4693440	4695281	Sure the Amico's coming out someday.
4696142	4697042	Actually came to pass.
4698884	4705368	There was the Hatoful Boyfriend plushies and the Dead by Daylight board game.
4705729	4708431	There was a lot of great Kickstarters that I backed.
4708691	4712654	The Shadowgate remake, GamerX when it was, you know, a thing.
4714135	4714976	Every year.
4716236	4722221	Got some Marble Run things from the company that bought my wooden pinball machine.
4724690	4753989	but unfortunately due to the success of those Kickstarters then everybody else started getting on board because they were like oh it's a way to get money and not have to actually do anything so now I don't I haven't backed a Kickstarter in a very long time and I probably won't again oh yeah the EGM one I gotta get on that before it closes that one I might break my streak for that that does look really cool and I do want to support the print media books because again we talked about this before but I do love the Guinness book and not just because we're in it like I love that it's a recent piece of gaming media so pretty cool
4755580	4766808	I wanted to mention this real quick before I get into this next story and then ultimately the classic game of the week, but I was talking about the arcade that Jason was at, so I was texting him and he just, I was like, well, how was that arcade?
4766848	4767329	I'm curious.
4767749	4775955	And so he messaged me back and he said, spacious given the sheer number of dance game setups they have, and then a little interior room for all the tapping games.
4776655	4784141	Three Step Maniacs machines and two Dance Rush machines in the front, a circle of four or five more ITG and DDR setups in the back.
4784981	4791743	It is a purpose-built arcade, music games, and mentions that there's other ones saying it makes for a good third place.
4791944	4798406	And I think that refers to that kind of phenomenon you might have heard about with Starbucks, really aims to be that third place.
4798786	4802607	You go to home, you go to work, and then you have that third place that you hang out at.
4802787	4803488	So, yeah.
4804588	4832442	interesting um interesting concept there but uh the ballet studio yeah this is probably the colonial theater for me but uh but yeah um neat um insight there I I actually I did I have not said this in about a year I kind of want to go to Vegas I haven't said that in a year because last time I went to Vegas but now TwitchCon this yeah it was TwitchCon and all that madness oh that was not good but
4833546	4837410	Now that I'm reading that, I'm like, oh, I kind of want to go to Vegas.
4838811	4839011	See?
4839291	4842314	I think what it is, I want to go to Vegas and not the Strip.
4844276	4844896	That's what it is.
4846057	4846337	All right.
4847238	4852783	I don't think I need to ever go shopping at Caesar's Palace again.
4853003	4853584	No, yeah.
4853724	4855245	It just made me sad.
4855425	4857567	Yeah, I just want to not go to the Strip.
4858147	4858328	So...
4859554	4860434	Alright, we'll see.
4860474	4861915	Oh, there's places I want to go.
4862115	4865316	Like, I can go shoot a crossbow at, you know, Excalibur.
4865356	4866816	Yeah, there's a lot of cool shit.
4866896	4869217	I wouldn't mind going back to Area 15 and all that.
4869277	4869857	That was pretty fun.
4869877	4870578	Yeah, that too.
4870798	4878360	But I also, you know, like how very badly I violated the crane game at Circus Circus last time I was there.
4880521	4887223	It was... I... For what they had in there, I managed to leave with half of it.
4889417	4899980	Alright, let's move on to this story, which is a very interesting piece of gaming history that crossed under my eyes this week, and I thought we'd talk about it.
4900340	4905001	So it is a rare VHS from a monumental court case.
4905681	4909022	So a VHS that was created for the court...
4909782	4910263	and DarkSakura.
4926044	4934714	Props to BlueSky because it was a BlueSky user, Molly Penn, over on BlueSky, wrote a bleat that said, Holy fuck, I think I found it.
4935375	4943605	It being GameFan's copy of one of the exhibit tapes that Data East produced for Capcom's lawsuit against them over Fighter's history.
4944425	4964120	and so sure enough within a day they got the tape created and now it's on YouTube and you can actually watch it and it's a 16 minute video and it is Data East side of the case so they actually start to outline I watched a good chunk of it and I have to say I was you know with as much as when I played Fighters History I was like yeah this is a Street Fighter clone
4965333	4966034	and DarkSakura.com
4984807	4990849	It's just what they never talk about, at least in that video, is the movesets and how they are very similar.
4991309	4995730	But does Capcom own the concept of a fireball or a sonic boom?
4996350	4999651	And that's ultimately what the court case kind of came down to.
4999691	5005513	I should state there was a second video that talked about the moves, but it was not on this particular tape.
5005853	5008314	But who knows, maybe that too will be found someday.
5008694	5011775	But I found the tape to be very interesting.
5013042	5014743	So I would highly recommend giving it a watch.
5015263	5018105	I actually put it up on our Blue Sky account.
5018165	5019846	Hey, look at me using social media.
5020906	5027590	And if you want to, check out our page over at orangeloungeradio.bsky.social.
5028030	5030891	I also did something I haven't done in a long time.
5031532	5033453	I asked the listeners, what do you think?
5034153	5041495	And Darktoseer responded over on Blue Sky saying, Personally, I thought most of the characters were different enough that you could tell the difference at a glance.
5041955	5052379	But Capcom claiming copyright on the various archetypes, Shoto characters with fireballs, Chinese kung fu fighter, thigh kickboxers, big slow grappler, etc.
5052739	5054139	seemed a bit of a reach.
5054679	5056620	So, I thought that was very...
5058365	5066294	If things turned out differently, we could have had a Street Fighter X Fighters History game.
5066735	5068597	I would still love to see...
5070438	5070678	Go ahead.
5093696	5101441	I never realized until I watched the video that there were things flashing on the opponents that were supposed to denote weak points.
5101922	5104323	That was Fighter's History's big difference from Street Fighter.
5104684	5105865	The weak points would flash.
5107045	5109647	I never realized that until I watched that video.
5109687	5110408	I was like, they did?
5111028	5111629	I remember that.
5113362	5114362	Barely remember that.
5114542	5114722	Yeah.
5115203	5117323	Anyway, very interesting piece of gaming history.
5117383	5119084	I just thought that was very cool.
5120704	5129887	Some folks saying that Dynamite, DarkTitsy in chat saying there are fans of the sequel and OrangeRite says, Fighter's history, Dynamite, or Karnov's Revenge is great.
5130187	5130407	Yeah.
5130587	5131208	Okay, man.
5131248	5132148	It's fair.
5132268	5133428	Karnov's Revenge was a little better.
5134048	5134349	All right.
5134449	5138910	Well, while we're on the topic of retro games, what a perfect time for our next segment.
5149675	5156980	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5157441	5160102	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5161323	5161964	Sorry about that.
5162024	5167267	A little audio bled through there, but DarkSakura, what did you pick for the classic game this week?
5168393	5197013	Pio Pio Da which I was so excited to get this game and then so disappointed when I played it but it's worth mentioning just for one of those quirky early Dreamcast games you know the name was Pio Pio Da featuring Atlanta System and it is a dancing game from 1999 that came out in the arcade and on the Dreamcast it was only released
5197825	5208953	in Japan, and it was an adaptation of another compile DiskStation games, Broadway Legend Elena.
5210074	5214737	So, basically, you're playing as Arl Nadja,
5217189	5240216	and they she and her friends are gonna take some time off of doing that whole appeal thing and have people dance with them so it's got different dance stages kind of like Parappa-ish I guess and then it has this thing called the Elena system so it uses that to render the game and
5242897	5253386	brings in a new original character named Elena Stevens who is the protagonist of Broadway legend Elena featuring Park Ji-young.
5255568	5258730	But you can play as one or two characters and you listen to
5259511	5286814	kind of J-pop-ish tunes more stuff that's like remixes of Puyo Puyo stuff or original tunes and then depending on how well you copy the moves that are put across you this is the part that gets into Parappa then you can drop nuisance Puyos on your opponent and if their bar drops to zero then it's over
5289023	5296628	But this one, this is one of the rare Puyo Puyo games that actually got mostly negative reviews.
5297349	5308057	GameSpot said it was 2.3 and the quote says it's a terrible rating and said you can't pick up Puyo Puyo Da and be
5308883	5310723	completely fed up within an hour.
5311304	5314604	And I mean, I got frustrated with it.
5314764	5316024	I thought it was cute.
5316064	5317825	I thought that the concept was great.
5317865	5324186	The music was... The dancing went on a little long, especially if you and the other player were really good at the game.
5325326	5327587	So you'd have a lot of repetition in it.
5327767	5338489	But overall, I thought that it was a fun venture into the, you know, pure story without actually, you know,
5339554	5341575	being a literal peel-peel game.
5343356	5347578	But it came out, like I said, in the arcade.
5348618	5351399	And the Dreamcast release was a...
5354602	5356463	Okay, so I should switch to showing the arcade version then.
5356483	5356944	Let's do that.
5356964	5358185	And it was, of course, a Naomi game.
5358205	5359806	So, that's all I have to say about it.
5378317	5378697	All right.
5379317	5383478	I somehow never played this at all, as much as I loved music games and all of that.
5383518	5385699	I thought I had you over when I got this.
5386479	5387019	Maybe?
5387259	5388339	I do not remember it.
5388559	5389079	I really don't.
5389199	5394960	I think I got this and Rainbow Cotton close to the same time.
5395521	5396081	Interesting.
5396861	5398141	I love this character, though.
5398301	5402102	It looks like a cheap, cheap fish in a ballerina suit.
5402182	5402482	Tara?
5402502	5402582	Yeah.
5403537	5407080	oh yeah I like to like in normal P.O.P.O.
5407100	5428595	when you play against them it's just fish but yeah that's that's just like the series of splash screens from the arcade version but the music in the game is really is really cute you know but um I think one of these games I might have to do the series that Arla came from all right
5429827	5453952	well for now we'll leave it that it's your classic game of the week okay let's get back into some gaming news we have release dates coming up as well and maybe some of your calls coming up on air here from the green room a little later but first we have some rapid fire news we're going to talk about some other headlines quite quickly I need to go AFK real quick but I will be back
5455984	5463428	So, Star Wars Outlaws has a brand new patch on the PlayStation 5 that patches in screen tearing.
5463728	5465089	Love that screen tearing.
5466530	5478617	Yeah, apparently they were improving stealth, NPC AI, and other things, but it somehow also affected the screen updating.
5479517	5480818	And along with that, it says...
5482580	5483781	Yooka-Yooka-Replay?
5483821	5484101	Yooka-Laylee?
5510111	5514612	It's Yooka-Laylee, but it's Yooka Replay-Laylee.
5514672	5516292	They're playing words there.
5517332	5523194	So it's a remaster of Yooka-Laylee that is going to be headed to the Nintendo Switch.
5524234	5533296	This is actually going to be coming, I don't know when, but it was just announced at the MCM EGX event in London.
5534716	5535336	And it looks nice.
5535356	5539037	They're going to have remastered art and animation.
5540464	5560472	New Improved Challenges, a new Collectible Currency, they're going to have revised controls and camera, and a dreamy orchestral soundtrack that's being done by the video game composers for Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong Country.
5562693	5567375	Dr. C in the chat is saying, actually, they said Nintendo platforms, so maybe Switch 2?
5567876	5568396	Question mark?
5568656	5568876	Maybe.
5570619	5572559	I mean, I would assume if it's being announced now.
5573400	5576320	It didn't say specific, but we'll see.
5576940	5577320	We'll see.
5577900	5579081	I think that's a safe bet to me.
5579181	5581841	Or maybe it's going to be playable on both, probably.
5582741	5585942	Because we expect that the Switch 2 will be backwards compatible.
5586502	5589662	The question is, hopefully we're making a right assumption there.
5589682	5593343	I would be extremely disappointed if it's not.
5595023	5599304	But the question is, will games play better or will they play differently?
5601080	5606343	on a Switch 2, but Nintendo's just going to have to answer that someday, whenever they feel like it, I guess.
5607384	5607944	We'll see.
5608604	5610005	Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
5613193	5625322	I have a classic game that not many people might know about called Metamorphic Force, which is a 1993 Konami game.
5625923	5631987	The beat-em-up is this week's Arcade Archives release.
5633228	5658416	it will be released in Japan or it's already out in Japan and then we're supposed to get it over here not too far later but it uses the same hardware that Mystic Warriors uses and it's a fun game I've played it I think I have it on my Evercade but yeah it would be a good thing to pick up okay
5660280	5663322	By the way, the folks should know about this game here at Orange Sounds Radio.
5663342	5666784	You picked this as your classic game somewhere around like 993 or something.
5667284	5671326	So it was pointed out by Dark Tetsuya that you've done this as a classic game.
5672387	5672607	It's fun.
5673868	5675329	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5704088	5706170	Why would I be offended by them being obscure?
5731711	5739636	Peepees and Beebees from 1991, Snow Bros 2 from 1994, and Skyshark, the 8-bit version.
5740356	5741497	Fucking love Skyshark.
5742198	5742878	So there you go.
5743919	5746000	Pretty cool that that is going to be happening.
5746040	5747841	Yeah, very excited to see that.
5747901	5749302	I need to get some more Evercade cartridges.
5749362	5750042	I only have a few.
5750102	5753364	I never really went hog and bought a lot more, but I need to.
5754795	5759719	All right, well, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games that are coming out very soon.
5759999	5761340	So, Loki, we'll start in the U.S.

5775151	5775411	Yes.
5775571	5776192	Oh, that's cool.
5776572	5777633	Yes, it is.
5777673	5780635	I believe it's the remaster of the original game.

5903754	5905015	Is it about cheese?
5906096	5908198	It is about farming and magic.
5908498	5911761	So farm... Oh, I thought you said formagia.
5911781	5912962	Formagia.
5913162	5915664	I mean, it could be about cheese.
5915965	5916805	Formagia.
5917286	5917826	There we go.
5918267	5923451	It looks like it's like beasts and farming.
5923952	5925934	And what is your magical discipline?
5926434	5926935	Cheese!
5929789	5935633	I mean, honestly, if I'm looking at the screenshots and judging based on that, I barely see any farming.
5936294	5938656	But then I do see farming, so I don't know.
5941038	5941278	Maybe.
5942463	5971988	Alright, well I'm gonna travel to Japan I was looking up that Clock Tower and it is, like it's I have to remember the one we got on Playstation was Clock Tower 3, this is the actual original one from the Super Famicom, is like a remake on the Switch, that's pretty cool so, anyway cause I don't think that that one's ever been released outside of Japan, officially I think there's been like fan transfers I have an English version of Clock Tower that I was considering playing for Retro Night Oh, which, oh, well

6143418	6147441	I don't think we do, but I will always ask for them as I have been.
6148422	6149083	Loki, we'll go to you.
6150063	6153065	And it's quest to become more like Overwatch 1.
6153205	6162432	Overwatch 2 has now announced that... Well, they already announced that they're going to be returning to its 6v6 format.
6163152	6163993	But it's coming soon.
6164093	6166154	Next season, actually, is when that's coming out.
6166274	6168676	And they're actually doing testing for it right now.
6169336	6173099	So they're going to start holding two separate tests for the return to 6v6.
6174720	6201517	it's going to take place with the new season starting December 10th however instead of returning to the 2-2-2 role spread it is actually going to they're requiring one hero of each role and then the three other people can just do whatever they want and then also they're going to be tweaking the 5v5 format a new variation for it that allows basically two heroes per role
6203228	6204890	and then I guess the third person is just whatever.
6206552	6206952	Cool.
6207753	6208815	I, yeah.
6209716	6212018	It's like, is this even Overwatch 2 at this point?
6212118	6216063	Like, has it, if we're going back to everything that Overwatch 1 was?
6216263	6218906	Well, it's kind of what the fans asked for to be honest.
6219107	6222050	It was, I mean, but also, like,
6223936	6225057	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6242955	6247219	They're not really going back to what people had before which was the 2-2-2 system.
6247819	6253084	I'm assuming they are doing that because queue times got really bad in original Overwatch.
6253124	6256787	They had to come up with these creative ways because not enough people were queuing for tanks.
6257227	6265815	So I'm not sure that they want to just go back to that old system because it's probably going to cause a lot of problems with queuing.
6265835	6266496	That makes sense.
6267176	6271037	in both those modes, you have a lot of flexibility in a lot of those roles.
6271097	6271977	So that'll be interesting.
6272458	6274138	And Deft brings up a very good point.
6274558	6277039	Maps now are designed to be five versus five.
6277099	6279800	This is why we don't have two point maps like Hanamura.
6280320	6284661	So, yeah, I'll be interested to see what it changes to the game.
6285121	6290042	But I also sort of think like maybe Blizzard ought to think about what is next for Overwatch.
6290082	6291223	Bring all the old maps back.
6291963	6292463	DarkSakura,
6313194	6314476	People are just gonna scream.
6314636	6322667	And to be fair, probably for no reason because Blizzard is now in a different place than it was when Overwatch 2 happened.
6323067	6324930	Bobby Kotick is no longer in the picture.
6325671	6330617	Him and Mike Morhaime are not actively having creative differences over Blizzard games anymore.
6331218	6335120	So I do want to, you know, and the Overwatch team lead is different, right?
6335160	6335840	The other guy left.
6336221	6342584	So Overwatch has the potential to be in a very different place and maybe take some of the best for one and two and kind of put it in.
6343004	6348407	So I don't think we should necessarily react if we're going to hear Overwatch 3, but everybody's going to.
6349948	6353169	But I also think maybe Overwatch 3 is not a great branding.
6353570	6356011	I think it's time to, I honestly think.
6357199	6357639	What do I know?
6357659	6357900	Alright.
6373119	6378866	One more story, and I thought this one was funny, so I would save this for last, but it is an actual accessory.
6378986	6380188	This isn't even a joke.
6380868	6387676	It's an actual, I mean, the Xbox mini fridge, which is really a mini cooler, which really doesn't cool shit, but okay.
6387997	6390419	That ended up being real, so why not this?
6391040	6393142	Southern comfort of all companies.
6394241	6394702	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6409284	6413067	It's something you can get in a giveaway, but you can also buy it for $50.
6413287	6418392	It went on sale Friday, so I don't know if it's already sold out or what.
6419192	6422035	Let's see, I'm actual... Why couldn't we have that with a good drink?
6423036	6424837	It's out of stock, so sorry.
6424857	6427960	It's a little bottle, so maybe you can find something with the same form factor, I guess.
6428140	6432224	If you didn't buy it already, you're probably screwed because it's out of stock, which is not surprising at all.
6433145	6441332	But the SoConsole is the only gaming console cover in the world that can store and dispense shooters of the SoCo sour straight to gamers age 21 and up.
6441773	6448399	This innovative device is part gaming accessory, part celebration, offering fans an epic way to upgrade their gaming experience.
6449420	6451702	They keep emphasizing this is for adults only.
6452322	6479134	that would be more of a downgrade if I was playing they call it an upgrade but it doesn't even fry chicken I mean so I just I can't really follow that yeah I mean like if there was a pizza oven you know that would just make me a pizza in the middle of the game when I don't want to get up and make one although I guess to be fair it wasn't a fryer it was a chicken warmer but whatever you know what no chicken involved no fried chicken
6480359	6506441	denied plus it looks like you it doesn't actually like dispense shots out of a nozzle it looks like you put the little bottles in the top and then when you hit the bottom one of them pops out and the greatest part about that is like you actually look at the the like the close-up shots that they have and it's all 3d printed too it's like oh no wonder it's so cheap how cheap we can cheap this you know it's it's
6507421	6507882	Whatever.
6508462	6513307	Is someone really that big of a fan of this?
6513928	6515470	I'm only talking about it for the lols.
6516331	6517252	But it's sold out.
6517392	6519054	Even the remote's 3D printed.
6519294	6520615	Yeah, all of it's 3D printed.
6521296	6526182	As Joe100Matt says, speaking of which, did you see the Atari whiskey decanter in the shape of a joystick?
6526342	6527943	I did not, but that doesn't surprise me.
6528764	6552132	to be honest that I would buy yeah just because I feel like whiskey whiskey decanters are things I see like I they had one at Dragon Con that was like official and everything so um I mean if you want like a good tie-in product that's unnecessary but at least has the most functionality I would say probably that the uh the Deadpool butt controllers would wait what
6553414	6554415	Yeah, haven't you seen those?
6554735	6561239	They're Xbox controllers with a little additional... Junk in the trunk.
6561619	6561840	Sorry.
6561880	6564501	Junk in the trunk ergonomics, I guess.
6565202	6572206	I'm just... I'm left... So I have these photos up on stream of the actual Atari joystick decanter, and I'm laughing because they have all these stock photos, right?
6572566	6576489	And then this very last photo is like, aw, honey, you shouldn't have.
6576529	6579991	They're so happy that they got their Atari whiskey set.
6580532	6580712	Like...
6582993	6586535	Honestly, that would be considered romance in my house, I'm just saying.
6586695	6589556	Yeah, they should serve those at the Atari Hotel.
6589956	6591277	Did that ever become a thing?
6591557	6592557	I don't think it did.
6592637	6595379	I don't know if that was COVID or what that stopped that, but yeah.
6595419	6595979	Too bad, man.
6595999	6596659	Yeah, it's too bad.
6596919	6600861	I was into the idea of an Atari Hotel, but I guess it was just us.
6601281	6601962	Nobody else in the world.
6602902	6608785	I guess also romantic in my house would be, hey, I made chicken tenders instead of chicken nuggets.
6610005	6610986	Well, I like them both.
6611046	6611446	Thank you.
6612051	6614993	All right, well, we're to that point in the show with the listener roundtable.
6615053	6623740	So I'd like to invite, if anybody wants to call, the green room is open over at vognetwork.com slash discord is the place to join our discord server and talk to us.
6624380	6627322	If you want to join the green room, I'm going to check if there's any emails.
6627402	6628703	Participate at orangelaundry.com.
6629824	6631025	Well, so much for that.
6631365	6632746	Well, hey, but good news.
6633566	6636568	We're now back on a social network that I like using.
6636708	6641150	So if you want to message us throughout the week on short form, Blue Sky is the place to do it.
6641271	6644352	Orangeloungeradio.bsky.social until further notice.
6645273	6647174	I will try to get that changed to our domain.
6647474	6651076	But until that happens, orangeloungeradio.bsky.social is the place to do it.
6651316	6652157	So check that out.
6652377	6658901	And you can send us messages and we will start including those in this segment so it doesn't feel so empty when there's no emails.
6660203	6662544	Um, but otherwise I think that's it.
6663365	6664985	I think we, we're out of stuff.
6665646	6666046	We're done.
6666746	6667246	That's all right.
6667486	6667726	Oops.
6668047	6668427	It's fine.
6668867	6673089	I have some errands to catch up on because I was very busy this weekend with it being Halloween weekend.
6673109	6674770	I hosted a show Friday night and Saturday night.
6675110	6675730	Both were fun.
6675770	6677991	I had a great time, but yeah, good stuff.
6678257	6691708	Jamie, you need to look up, I was looking, trying to find news stories, but I saw there was something, it was an article, or not an article, a forum post on NeoGAF talking about, I want fake 3D graphic games to come back.
6692048	6697272	And they were showing trailers, obviously, Victory Heat Rally is the first one that comes to mind as of recent.
6697793	6703858	But they showed, it's a video that was on X for Mirage Feathers.
6704946	6717658	that looks right up your alley it looks very awesome if you can find me the link I would love to checketh that outeth I will link the post to you thank you nice
6719848	6721770	Alright, you know what I'm trying to look around for?
6721890	6725413	I'm trying to find some fun new hoodies because hoodie weather is coming up again.
6725753	6729397	And you know I love my Atari hoodie that actually has like the wood grain.
6729697	6735782	But the thing is that thing's getting kind of old now and I want like some new like gaming hoodies that aren't just like a logo on a hoodie.
6736082	6744970	And I feel like whenever I search for things online like all I get are like every fucking printing shop in the world that just slaps a logo that they probably don't even have the rights to on a hoodie.
6745330	6745831	I don't want that.
6745851	6746752	Like I want something legit.
6747552	6749634	Oh, they had a Steam Next demo for it.
6750675	6751175	For a hoodie?
6752236	6754998	No, for this game I was talking about.
6755718	6764645	But yeah, if you guys have good suggestions for gamer hoodies, I'd love to be sent those on Blue Sky or on my personal or the Orange Lounge, whatever works for you.
6765986	6767307	Loki, you mentioned Last Minute Stories.
6767327	6767968	You got anything for us?
6769153	6792018	No, there's nothing out there I don't want to say it's been a slow news week because I feel like there were some heavy hitters but I feel like we got through it all and that's all there is to say about that I mean, I guess this is something it's very small allegedly there's a leak that was saying there's a company of Virtuos is going to be porting Elden Ring Definitive Edition to whatever the next Nintendo console is next year
6794105	6807410	I'm not surprised to hear we're gonna get a lot of ports on the next Nintendo console that's gonna catch us up on some of the latest and greatest stuff but I'm just gonna caution and I hope Nintendo knows this by now
6810646	6814307	The last time they did that, that was the Wii U's launch lineup.
6814467	6815808	It did not go well for them.
6817008	6823931	I guess, long story short, do not expect Elden Ring to replace new games.
6825001	6852860	that's not going to launch the system that won't sell that system it's a nice thing to buoy and to create a nice archive and there will be people that are very strictly Nintendo systems that probably did not buy Elden Ring otherwise I'm not saying it's not worth releasing on Nintendo but I need Nintendo to learn their lesson from the Wii U and don't trust some third party person to leave you at the altar like EA did because they'll do it in a heartbeat
6854850	6856711	Anyway, because they're not going to sell like they were new.
6858811	6860392	I hope they know that by now.
6860532	6862873	But you know what we'll probably get?
6863273	6864913	We'll probably get another version of Skyrim.
6865093	6868515	That's what we deserve is another version of Skyrim.
6870455	6870775	Anyway.
6872176	6872496	All right.
6873496	6876797	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought and we'll wrap it up for tonight.
6877097	6879318	DarkSakura, I imagine you are streaming.
6879358	6881919	Are you back on Halloween-y Dead by Daylight tonight?
6882879	6887204	Yeah, I don't know how long I'm going to play because I'm still pretty, like, tired from last night.
6887725	6894133	I mean, when I got home, it was, like, almost three in the morning.
6894934	6895314	Oh, boy.
6895555	6896276	You got late.
6896316	6898298	I had Rocky Horror and you were later than I was.
6899139	6901582	Dan got up and watched some videos and I...
6902717	6903678	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6930382	6938270	Pocket Camp completes releasing on December 3rd for $10 until the end of January.
6938370	6938830	Then it goes up to $20.
6942403	6943943	Alright, well, have a good stream, DarkSakura.
6943963	6944903	I'm going to play some Debbie.
6945143	6946384	Alright, we'll see you in a minute.
6946684	6948164	Bye!
6948304	6953125	Then, I forgot to do this spiel about, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please help us spread the word.
6953185	6955845	We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.
6956205	6960546	So, a nice five-star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, YouTube, wherever it is that you found this show.
6960846	6963187	It goes an awful long way, and we really appreciate it.
6964007	6965547	So, with that, Loki, your final thought.
6967087	6968387	Hopefully, I'll have an episode out this week.
6968487	6971868	I was hoping they'd have it done last week, but at least I'm well...
6972671	6975277	into it now, so hopefully this week.
6976485	6983791	My final thought is I learned the hard way that even though apparently YouTube shorts are three minutes, they are not automatically processing as shorts yet.
6983811	6988756	And I'm still waiting on YouTube to get on that because I was... Do you have to do the hashtag shorts thing still?
6988996	6989336	I don't know.
6989376	6990217	Does that even work?
6990357	6990697	I don't know.
6990737	6996202	Like I tried in studio to upload like a three minute vertical video or it was like two minutes, 15 seconds.
6996682	6998724	And it's still put in my regular gallery.
6998784	7000586	So I don't know if it actually, it pushed just a short.
7000926	7002267	I didn't know I could hashtag it though.
7002547	7003008	Interesting.
7003208	7031865	yeah that's it used to be the thing like you'd have to you put in the title and it would do it or title and the body of this description as well apparently YouTube's working on that but yeah otherwise I've got some videos with some more retro games this week and yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna play something on stream I'm thinking tomorrow I want to do retro stuff early this week because there's a very high chance I'm gonna pick up Dragon Age when it comes out and then that'll kind of take over for a little bit so
7033407	7033687	All right.
7034367	7034947	Well, that's it.
7035187	7036888	Y'all have a great week, everybody.
7036928	7042529	We will see you back here in seven days to talk about Dragon Age, Halloween, whatever else is going on.
7042969	7044629	I agree with Matt's earlier comment.
7044749	7045489	Please vote.
7047730	7050950	We'll beat this in again next week when it's really close to Election Day.
7051010	7055131	But as early voting is a thing almost everywhere, please go vote if you are able to.
7056771	7058111	It's so important right now.
7058751	7061352	And I already told you where I stand on that.
7062032	7090380	so I think y'all know what we're thinking and that is that we want to see this country go forward and not backwards and there's only one ticket that's going to do that and here's a hint it's not the one that's having rallies at Madison Square Garden on that thought we're going to close out and we will see you next week bye everybody thank you you've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios
7092202	7092903	See you next week.
