9520	15862	Yesterday I was telling some friends about Mother 3, and today I'm learning about a Japanese-only F-Zero release I either didn't know about or had forgotten about.
15962	19883	I don't have any memory of F-Zero's non-console nor arcade releases, so it's probably the former.
19983	23124	The import titles we get via Nintendo Switch Online have been an interesting drip feed.
23264	27865	Mother 3 may never reach the West officially, but to experience two F-Zero games I've never previously had is a boon.
28085	29906	Import hipsters, radio condescending sneers.
30146	34807	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.
35047	37128	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice...
39178	41600	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
41640	46404	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46524	61917	It is Orange Lounge Radio live once again on our world record long run here with episode number 1019 for tonight on October the 6th of 2024.
62417	68002	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as they do every week, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
73171	74071	Hello, how are you?
76353	76754	Swollen.
77954	79456	That does not sound fun.
81277	82258	Yeah, it is not.
82278	94006	Let's just say that, well, stuff can continue to ferment when you start making sangria, and opening a sealed bottle after two months can be explosive.
94827	95988	That sounds so scary.
96028	99731	I'm sorry to hear that that happened, but I hope you're feeling better.
101004	102765	Well, enough drugs will make anyone feel better.
103125	104766	Well, let me give you something to look forward to.
104886	109027	Did I correctly see on your husband's Facebook, I think that's where I saw it, that Pentagogo's next weekend?
110008	110328	It is.
111588	113029	I don't go to Pentagogo anymore.
113169	113709	Oh, you don't?
113789	114749	Is it bad or something?
115590	117891	No, it's because Cornfield.
119471	119671	Oh.
120052	128415	And after the allergic reaction that I'm having from last night's event, and I will elaborate later on my own time,
129891	132353	I don't need any more allergic reactions to anything.
132773	133113	Fair.
133273	136535	I must admit, I'm kind of tempted because I don't think I've ever been to that show.
136575	142799	I feel like I'm always doing something in October when they have it, but I'm actually kind of free next weekend, so I might go check that out.
142899	145381	I don't think the facility is air-conditioned.
145741	145861	Oh.
146141	148422	Well, we're finally going to break this.
148742	152223	It's 100 degrees here in Sacramento, California, where we're all based.
152803	156644	And it's early October, and it's still 100 freaking degrees.
157344	159445	But I think that streak finally breaks next weekend.
159465	162846	I think it's going to be a much more sensible 74 degrees.
162906	165787	No, I think it's like low 80s, but still, I'll take it versus this.
166707	171630	Also, and I'll just say this, I don't know what Dan posts on Facebook because I don't go on Facebook.
171810	172730	Oh, right, right, right.
172910	174991	Well, I'm pretty sure that's where I saw it.
175451	178052	But, well, speaking of pinball... I'll ask him.
178933	185136	I did think of you because I was in Old Town, Sak, and there's a new pinball place down there.
186076	186877	Yeah, it's weird.
215896	215976	Yeah.
216036	216116	Yeah.
244284	249768	Anyway, let's say hello as well, of course, as we do every week to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
250588	250868	Hello.
250988	251429	Hi, Loki.
251449	251829	How are you?
252609	252910	I'm fine.
253710	254551	Good, good, good.
255251	257573	What game is that running behind you tonight?
257713	258874	I'm trying to see what it is.
260014	261295	Well, what's it look like?
261775	262756	There's meat.
263056	264797	Attack the enemy by swinging the whip controller.
264857	266038	It's some type of Castlevania.
266058	267079	Is it the Castlevania arcade game?
267813	268954	It's Castlevania the arcade game.
269814	270334	I got it!
270554	271015	I got it!
271695	272155	I won!
272235	272696	I win!
273276	273956	That's fun.
274016	275217	What made you decide to pick that?
276057	276758	I don't know.
277218	278839	I'm trying to pick games I've never picked before.
278859	281940	I'm like, ah... I sat here for like five minutes going, I don't know.
282000	283221	And I was like, ah, October.
283241	285362	Okay, let's think of like spooky game.
285402	286503	Okay, Castlevania.
287043	290385	And then that was something I saw that I was like, oh, I don't recognize that.
290445	294207	Or like, I actually wonder like, is there an arcade game other than Haunted Mansion?
295227	296048	And yep, there was.
297253	301816	Yeah, I was like, I feel like I've seen Castlevania references everywhere this last week.
301956	307099	There's, of course, you know, Dracula and half the Belmonts are in Dead by Daylight now.
308040	309141	But no Richter.
309781	315004	No, no Richter yet, but aren't there like five alt skins now for Trevor?
315084	319787	Yeah, they're doing... Who was the last Belmont from that last game?
320888	321909	Or not Belmont, but...
323362	324803	I guess he's a Belmont technically.
325143	330125	But yeah, there's all the alt characters.
330385	334206	Which is funny because Silent Hill has a bunch of alt characters too.
334527	335767	Cheryl has a ton of alts.
335827	342650	And now, of course, Silent Hill 2, I'm sure some of you are aware, just early access released last night.
343170	347412	So the new remake of Silent Hill, as well as Until Dawn.
347452	349793	So it's definitely October because all the scary stuff's coming out.
350493	377891	um just both released apparently uh feedback for both of those is pretty good uh I watched I've been hearing some different stuff about the Until Dawn one like the ray tracing is broken I I did hear at the beginning so something that a friend of mine was telling me about is that at the beginning it looked like it was like AI and it was a big like red flag like oh no was this an AI done job or something but I guess it gets better as the game goes on and I was watching one of my buddies stream the ending last night
380553	384236	I don't... It didn't look as good as I would have expected it to look.
384296	386238	I will say that, for what it's worth.
386258	390382	But I guess if I'd never played the series before, maybe I'd be really into it.
390422	392083	But the Silent Hill 2 looks great.
393144	396727	And apparently they've made some subtle... Shane was, of course, texting me all day about it.
397428	398809	And... Not really, once or twice.
398909	402812	But he's been telling me that there's been some subtle changes.
402832	404434	And obviously I don't want to go too much into that.
404474	406916	But that they've definitely gone back and re-evaluated...
407276	413922	What Makes Sense in 2024, or maybe even What Is It We Want to Do Different in 2024 versus the original Silent Hill.
413942	415864	And I think that's very interesting, quite frankly.
418306	427454	Anyway, going to our chat, because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific.
427814	429356	Right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
429736	434560	And DarkTetsuya, referencing the intro tonight, says, I did buy the Guinness Book Gamers Edition 2025.
434661	436122	Well, thank you.
436182	437884	I'm sure the Guinness people are happy to have your money.
438904	447532	Actually, I had an IRL friend buy it once they heard my, because I had posted on Facebook about it in the little picture that Matt had early on before I had my copy.
448173	451556	And one of my IRL friends saw the book on the shelf somewhere and just picked it up.
451656	452617	Was like, oh, my friend Romson does.
452657	453258	I'm going to buy this.
453678	454698	I thought that was really cool.
454718	455819	I was like, oh, that's really sweet.
456259	457059	So, yeah.
457200	467284	I don't know if you guys know more people that have bought it, but I feel like maybe we should have had, if we were smarter, we would have had an Amazon affiliate link or something to get a little kickback.
468624	468964	Oh, well.
469185	469465	Oh, well.
470505	470965	You know what?
471846	472806	I'm happy we're in it.
472926	473706	I think it's great.
473746	475127	We talked about that all a couple weeks ago.
475247	477068	I'm still waiting to hear back, though.
478168	481930	Yeah, because you're still trying to get the official, official certificate, right?
482731	486754	Yeah, I mean, I wonder, have you ever emailed the contact?
487594	488175	You know what?
488515	492958	No, I was supposed to, and I was out doing stuff, and you know me, out of sight, out of mind.
493058	496060	So remind me after tonight's show, and I'll send a quick email.
496681	500663	It does seem like that maybe this side of the house doesn't talk to that side of the house.
500783	502505	I feel like there's a little bit of that going on.
503025	508068	Or they'll be like, oh, you're in the book, but you didn't pay, so we're not going to give you certificate.
508449	510410	They might contract out some of these sub-editions.
510990	511711	That's my thought.
512981	513643	But we'll figure out.
513663	514646	We'll get to the bottom of this.
514706	515187	Yes, we will.
515649	515869	Anyway...
518726	523929	OG Happy Dude in chat says, was it 2025 or last year's that has Billy Mitchell's record redacted?
524470	528893	I haven't read the rest of the book, but I don't think they would really advertise a redaction.
529233	535517	And besides, at least as far as Donkey Kong goes, other people have had that record for a long time, right?
535557	537458	He hasn't had that anymore for a long time, I think.
538119	541541	Granted, he had some other old school records, so I know it's not just that.
541601	547025	But yeah, I don't know what Guinness did to him because honestly, when it comes to that guy,
548245	558892	I just don't care anymore I just don't care anymore I did meet him at DragonCon one year pre-pandemic so it was a while ago and I will say this
560353	563276	People have said that, oh, it's all a persona.
563376	565798	It's all a show that he puts on and all that, right?
566238	571903	And I would say from my experience when I interacted with him at DragonCon, I would find that to be true.
572284	584915	That I was there with a friend who had another relationship with him and they were having a casual conversation and I was like, okay, that whole bit about he's putting on an act for a lot of people, I believe that that's true, 100%. 100%.
587116	592398	So, uh, PodCulture talking about the book says it's $14.95 on Amazon right now for those interested.
592438	595679	Yeah, it's actually not that expensive, um, all things considered.
595739	600681	It's, it's, it feels a little more like a magazine to me, um, but I actually like it.
600881	604463	It's, it's very, um, it's very loud, like in a good way, so.
605403	610305	OG Happy Dude also says, speed running records are more impressive than high score records anyway.
610765	613526	I'm just wanting to hear about the Jotz and Mitchell lawsuit.
613566	616107	Well, here's the thing.
617788	623550	I think high scores are neat, but I really love when they find ways to break games.
624130	626652	Like the 256 board bug in Pac-Man?
627032	627733	Fascinating.
628013	632696	And all that stuff, like the way they kind of like find those hidden exploits and all these old and old games.
633037	635859	But speedrunning also brings a lot of that up.
635919	638901	You know, you watch any speedrun and as long as it's, you know...
640282	642544	Not 100%, no, what do they call that?
642644	644606	No hacking or no cheating or whatever.
645006	650010	Like, you will see a bunch of exploits that they do to get the speedruns done.
650050	652272	And that stuff is very, very fascinating to me.
653733	656015	I'm just like, points are good.
656675	657536	Achievements are good.
658037	658837	Have you ever had pizza?
660458	663541	But have you ever had pizza while getting achievements?
664362	665683	It's an achievement within itself.
665863	666884	Pepperoni unlocked.
666904	667104	What?
667890	670913	Alright, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight.
671494	673116	I think this is one of the biggest, like...
675347	682832	Obviously, sorts of stories, but we should talk about this a little bit anyway because I think this leads to a bigger problem in the games industry right now.
683152	690076	Loki, would you mind starting us off with tonight's story, which, by the way, was posted in our Discord server, vognetwork.com slash Discord.
690096	702203	I encourage you to join our Discord server and talk with us throughout the week because sometimes y'all post stories, and I don't know if Loki stole it from Discord, but he found the exact same story, and we like to talk about him on air because y'all find some neat stuff.
702263	703484	So, Loki, what's...
704144	704844	Where are we starting tonight?
705604	724390	Yeah, so Game Industry Biz reported on a survey done by Media Research that was basically pulling different gamers from around the world and asking them what type of gaming do you like doing?
724470	725110	Is it, you know,
725290	729731	PvE, PvP, Couch Co-op, Single Player, that type of stuff.
730532	742856	And they broke it up across all the different age brackets and come to find out 53% of gamers actually prefer to play games offline or a single player game.
743956	744976	Gasp, no.
745516	746797	I know, it's so crazy.
746957	749918	It does also trend upwards as you get older.
750418	753739	Probably because, you know, as a lot of folks are
754873	765179	In the 9-5, you know, day-to-day, it's hard to stay competitive in online games when a lot of, like, younger people have a lot more free time to do that stuff.
765259	768982	And so it can kind of dissuade you from wanting to do that type of thing.
769002	776526	Well, and a lot of us over the age of 30 and 40 don't like to log on to voice chat just to be called a slur, something misogynistic.
776646	779088	Like, I think a lot of us are just kind of over that.
780128	780589	Yeah, yeah.
781249	784091	Especially when it's like a 14-year-old that's saying it.
784891	790474	I flashback all the way to episode one of Orange Lounge Radio.
791115	798219	Orange Lounge Radio episode one, when DarkSakura was ranting about a mother who was changing her baby's diaper on a keyboard mania machine.
799860	801001	Yeah.
801301	802361	Where is your mother?
802842	804723	I will find her and I will talk to her.
806104	811108	Yeah, 74% of folks over the age of 55 prefer single-player gaming.
811368	815711	Also, 58% of mobile gamers prefer single-player titles as well.
816752	817972	Which is very interesting.
817992	819293	That is very interesting.
819574	823396	But, I mean, you know, there's a reason things like, like, I would say Candy Crush is single-player.
823416	824757	It's probably, like, more casual.
824857	833183	Like, you're just, like, you don't want the hassle or you don't have the internet infrastructure or you don't want to play a competitive game on a device that has no controller.
833243	833604	Like, it's
835088	837230	I could see a lot of reasons why you wouldn't want to do that.
837410	840992	Well, where would something like, let's say, Pokemon Go or Monster Hunter now?
841012	842993	Because you all know I'm obsessed with AR games.
843033	843874	I've talked about it a bunch.
844334	852099	Would a game like Pokemon Go, I mean, technically it's multiplayer, but I think for most people that's a very single-player experience until I'm ready to raid.
852219	855261	Like, it's a very incidental thing.
855481	859724	I think it's more like a single-player game with some online co-op
860504	878865	or PVP elements to it so it's even though it is an online game you're playing most of the game single player until you do like a raid or you fight you know you battle somebody or something like that but otherwise it's pretty much just a solo game yeah
879873	889658	or even like Pikmin, which, you know, again, another one I love is a very solo game, but like it's solo, but like you get to share stats with friends in meaningful ways.
889838	892239	Like that's, that's about how multiplayer that game gets.
892559	892900	So it's.
893040	893360	Yeah.
893460	894681	And I think that's good.
894781	900924	I mean, honestly, like if the question is, well, well, gamers prefer single player.
901004	903705	Why, why are they pushing for multiplayer money?
903965	904606	It's always money.
904726	909268	It's because they make so much money on online game, live service games.
910404	912526	that are successful, because there's a lot that aren't.
912586	913527	It's quite the gamble.
914447	921973	But if you do have a successful online live service game, then you rake in tons of money.
922034	923875	I mean, look at Grand Theft Auto Online.
923975	925396	Look at, you know, Fortnite.
925436	927618	Look at Overwatch.
928139	931121	Lots of perfect examples of making lots of money.
931441	932762	Look at Conquered.
933002	934804	Look at Babylon's Fall.
935184	937866	Look at, you know, the problem...
938887	941328	Look at Foam Stars having to make a big change.
941348	941968	We'll talk about this later.
942208	945869	There's only so much space in that box.
946669	951670	There's a finite number of players and a finite number of time that those players can play those games.
951910	961912	And it's just, if you're not putting out a compelling game or an argument to play your game, then people won't play your game and you'll get shut down really fast.
961972	964913	And also why companies are scared as hell to make new IPs.
966291	972314	Well, I mean, new IPs in the live service area, yeah, they should be scared.
972454	984699	Because it's just, it's very, you're relying on... Unless you're pulling in Disney, Speedstorm, Marvel, the Overwatch thingy, whatever it's called, I can't even remember now.
984779	987280	Unless you're pulling in something else that's recognizable, right?
987681	989982	Or Fortnite, pulling in literally everything.
991282	992683	I just, I mean...
994557	994917	I don't know.
995077	997518	I don't really like those types of games.
998978	1003140	Granted, if there was something that was really interesting, maybe I would play that.
1003360	1011962	But a lot of the stuff that comes out, especially when you start talking about all the monetization and stuff with it, it just really doesn't sound good.
1012062	1018984	Especially when you're having companies essentially try to adopt the mobile free-to-play model with a game that costs $80.
1019024	1019145	Like...
1021577	1049478	no you can't have it both ways I mean sure you could try but like it's it just screams very just greed driven and I'm sorry like if the argument is well our game is too expensive to make and we need to do all this to be sustainable then go back to the drawing board and think of something smaller like do something less crazy I mean go look at Among Us look at like you know um
1050697	1052258	Fall Guys, you know, stuff like that.
1052278	1055420	I mean, sure, those games didn't cost millions and millions of dollars to make.
1055560	1060684	And a lot of these things too, they're like spending a ton of money in game promotion.
1061284	1065167	And I think that's almost unnecessary if you have a pretty solid title.
1067267	1067888	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1085124	1114284	OG Happy Dude is bringing up Fortnite in chat kind of talking about the other way around remember it was supposed to be a single player game and Battle Royale was going to be like an extra thing and then Battle Royale just took the fuck over and OG Happy Dude in chat is asking where the hell is the single player co-op save the world experience that we were supposed to get in Fortnite I believe it's I believe it came out some time ago but it's like it's very de-emphasized like it's there in the shop you can buy it for like 10 bucks or however much but they very de-emphasized
1115104	1118046	Um, not something that's like front and center.
1118706	1126591	Uh, but I'm pretty sure it's there, but you know, now Fortnite, you know, again, Fortnite is now a platform and we've talked about this several months ago on the show.
1126971	1133815	Fortnite is no longer a game battle Royale or Fortnite colon battle Royale is the game.
1135114	1141220	Fortnite is now a platform because Fortnite also has Lego Fortnite, Rock Band 5.
1141921	1144884	Oh, excuse me, Lego Festival or whatever the hell they call that.
1144944	1145805	Fortnite Festival, that's it.
1146526	1147667	The racing game.
1147707	1149269	And there's going to be more things like that.
1149349	1151651	Fortnite is now a multi...
1152796	1170249	console platform of its own it's a virtual platform of its own and that's exactly where Fortnite I think wanted to be this whole time and it's it's that is really a thing of its own that's that and there's really not space for a lot of other things like it I think to be honest so
1172537	1174499	Yeah, OG Happy Dude says, that's dumb.
1174619	1179823	A free online, very toxic player base only to pay for the single player co-op experience?
1180123	1180543	F that.
1181224	1182164	Well, here's the thing.
1182365	1184907	The multiplayer experience really isn't free either.
1185087	1186468	I mean, sure.
1187048	1191992	You can play a lot for free and you can get through, but they're going to entice you with that battle pass.
1192653	1194674	Don't you want an Ariana Grande skin?
1195675	1196796	I got suckered in the Aria.
1196816	1198157	Don't you want a Tron skin?
1198177	1200639	Okay, I maybe got suckered in the Tron skin too.
1201020	1204762	Eventually, there's going to be something that's going to get you.
1206084	1233610	they're gonna get you unless you are very strong-willed or really really casual in your gameplay and that stuff really does not matter to you because of course I could sit here and say it's it's impossible to and someone's always gonna speak up and say I didn't do it of course of course you can you can be very strong-willed and get through that stuff without ever spending a dime but they make it very difficult they make it very very okay gotcha yeah sorry even OG happy dude says in chat the Ryu and Chun-Li skins got me sigh see see
1236175	1236655	We agree.
1239197	1239717	That's funny.
1240497	1241478	But no, you're not alone.
1241498	1241978	You're not alone.
1241998	1245740	There's something, even DarkSakura, you even bought something in Fortnite, didn't you?
1245840	1246320	Didn't you buy?
1246340	1246420	Yeah.
1247100	1247381	Yeah.
1247901	1251643	I got the Ariana Grande skins and I got Emma Frost.
1252703	1253544	Oh, yeah, yeah.
1253604	1256625	So there's, they get you eventually.
1256685	1257125	Goddess.
1257646	1257886	You know.
1260526	1265890	Also, I got the Master of Puppets emote because it's absolutely hilarious to watch Ariana Grande doing Master of Puppets.
1266410	1270673	I love Fortnite Festival with Ariana Grande when you can do like a death metal song with her on vocals.
1270953	1271173	Fun.
1271673	1277437	Anyway, here's, I guess, maybe like the point and what I wanted to get to with this.
1277497	1283361	So yeah, there's, it's, I mean, 53% is also not a big majority.
1284002	1286283	53% sounds like a poll in the presidential election right now.
1286343	1288925	We know how like disgustingly close this presidential election is.
1289645	1291206	Which shouldn't be, but that's another topic.
1291827	1295329	It is, and 53 is still pretty close.
1295529	1306235	But the way the industry operates sometimes, and especially with a lot of these companies you look at that are failing, it really looks like they're putting all of their eggs in one half of the basket.
1307504	1308085	and so on.
1330267	1330788	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1347105	1363807	Mass Effect 3 for me was like that perfect balance and I know a lot of people hated the multiplayer of Mass Effect 3 so people are going to disagree with me and that's fine but I think Mass Effect 3 was that perfect balance of like there is a full ass fucking rounded single player awesome experience here
1364528	1388336	and then there's a little multiplayer experience you can get in there and teehee with your friends and it really was to be played with your friends because it was a horde mode, PvE type of game that you can go do on the side and I actually found that really rewarding in that experience and that's where I think game design is best when it's really a single player focused game and multiplayer is something that's kind of added there a little bit after the fact
1389076	1394399	Not necessarily a hard and fast rule because, sure, I enjoy Dead by Daylight as well, which has no single-player mode.
1395039	1400282	They are starting to contract with other companies to make single-player experiences, like the casting of Frank Stone.
1400342	1401302	That's a single-player game.
1401883	1403643	But bye-bye, Dark...
1405954	1407517	Dead by Daylight is a multiplayer game.
1408198	1412145	Not every game is going to be that either, even in the horror space.
1412566	1418836	Like, I feel like a lot of games that try to be in that same asymmetrical space have kind of...
1421179	1438104	Texas Chainsaw Massacre it's still there actually Alan really still loves Texas Chainsaw Massacre and plays it but they don't they're not able to get that same constant support and it's kind of killer clowns I feel like hit really fast and then although I'm shocked that they got the Elvira that's a game I wouldn't mind seeing die well
1438724	1439826	For personal reasons.
1440086	1441327	I know, but they got the Elvira.
1441367	1445772	When you put the clownophobia aside, the Elvira license is huge.
1446313	1447294	I'm kind of shocked.
1447554	1449536	We didn't talk about that last week, I don't think.
1449876	1452559	But they got Elvira licensed, which I was like, what?
1453260	1453460	What?
1454332	1456253	That's not to say Elvira can't be in other games.
1456273	1458695	That's still not enough to get me over that game.
1458995	1459716	No, I understand.
1460536	1461057	And then what else?
1461677	1468041	Obviously Friday the 13th came before Dead by Daylight, but Friday the 13th I think kind of imploded for a lot of other reasons.
1468081	1471224	I don't think it had anything to do, because I think that team actually made Killer Clowns.
1471764	1473885	So they're still kind of doing their thing.
1473925	1474346	And then what else?
1474366	1478188	There's another asymmetrical game that was being streamed for a hot minute that came out.
1478228	1478949	What was the one
1481328	1482849	Our buddy Isoco loved to stream it.
1482869	1484010	It was the schoolhouse game.
1484430	1486032	They were in the high school running around.
1486752	1488213	The little puppet, the doll master.
1488293	1488814	VHS.
1488854	1489294	That's it.
1489514	1490055	There was that.
1490135	1490915	That one came and went.
1491876	1494118	So... Anyways, I just...
1496124	1498706	OG HappyDude says, Elvira in Dead by Daylight?
1498906	1499406	I wish.
1499566	1504330	That's where I'd like to see her, but she's actually just getting added to Killer Clowns from Outer Space.
1506692	1509434	DarkSakura has said it on the show before.
1509514	1513417	She does not care for clowns, which is a very common kind of phobia.
1513437	1520782	There's a lot of people that probably are not going to ever play that game unless they do something like what they do with the spiders in...
1521863	1524868	Grounded, and you can turn them into blobs with eyes.
1525048	1530517	That's the only way some people are going to be able to play that game is killer blobs or whatever.
1531278	1534383	There's another game that turns all the spiders into...
1536818	1539602	It turns them into like a... It's the word spider.
1539662	1540923	I've seen that one before.
1541123	1546310	There was another game recently that also had a mode where you actually turned them into another creature.
1546670	1550615	It turned them into like squirrels or something.
1550995	1552637	There was one that turned them into cats.
1552738	1553278	Interesting.
1553759	1555301	And I think that may have been...
1558531	1559852	God, I think that was Grounded.
1560113	1563175	Well, no, Grounded was the one that turned the spiders into blobs.
1563636	1565057	But there was another one recently.
1565077	1566478	Yeah, they're just little blobs with eyes.
1566498	1567419	There was another one recently.
1567439	1568180	I can't think of it.
1568220	1568540	It's okay.
1568840	1569201	It's okay.
1569561	1576467	Oh, it's... No, it turned... The cat one is from Satisfactory.
1576547	1577488	That's what that one is.
1577728	1580010	Mike Deft says Lethal Company does that.
1580070	1583073	Loki turns the spiders into the word spiders.
1583213	1583473	Spiders.
1584614	1587876	I know I've seen a bunch of different things like that.
1588117	1595242	Yeah, recently I saw on a Let's Game It Out video the spiders turned into cats on Satisfactory.
1595623	1596463	Just cat heads.
1597344	1598145	But that's worse.
1598205	1599145	I don't want to hurt cats.
1599385	1599586	That's...
1600305	1602327	Yeah, because they meow when you kill them, too.
1602908	1604349	Oh, that's horrible!
1605150	1606251	That's horrible!
1607072	1608233	It's not really a spider.
1608453	1609834	Or it's not really cats, it's spiders.
1609854	1612597	I'd rather do the spiders, to be quite honest.
1612757	1613578	So, there's that.
1613678	1614319	Alright, anyway.
1618374	1627117	The other point I'm really trying to make with this is that we've talked about how the industry is almost feeling like it's in a soft crash right now.
1627857	1631658	It's not a crash as hard as 1983, 1984 when they basically took the consoles out with it and all that.
1636792	1638852	I don't think we're in that hard of a crash right now.
1639253	1643353	We're definitely in a soft crash, and that's evidenced by all the layoffs we see going on.
1643914	1653016	And I think it's because too many companies are putting too many eggs in the multiplayer basket, and there's not enough people that really want that.
1653636	1660597	And I would say case in point is probably Sony's whole... Remember when Sony said they were working on, what was it, 12 live service games?
1660697	1663118	And then they came out and said, nope, just kidding, we're working on six.
1663658	1671063	and now one of them has flopped like there's really no other way to put it you know it really kind of damages everything
1673646	1695180	I just hope the industry is hearing this, but unfortunately, these boobs at the top that often run these things and make these types of calls only see the dollar signs that things like Fortnite and Dead by Daylight and the leaders of the game make thinking, oh, we take that template, we put it on our game, and profit.
1696058	1702480	or they just do short-term profits so that the CEO's like, okay, how can I get as much money as possible?
1702520	1706061	Not thinking about the company, it's just for themselves.
1706481	1712984	And so they'll make all sorts of bad decisions or whatever to make sure that they hit their target so they get their bonuses.
1713044	1717765	And then if people hate them, they just get fired and then move to the next company and do the same thing.
1718465	1723147	Because that's how corporations work nowadays, apparently.
1724330	1729773	FifthDream in chat says, the amount of trash junk games that come out these days feels so much like the 80s Crash.
1729973	1733574	Just, yeah, I mean, it just, it's big games, too.
1733814	1741798	Ubisoft, really stupid for putting the whole word of, you know, quadruple A studio in everybody's brains because...
1742438	1742538	Yeah.
1742558	1742698	Yeah.
1764606	1767168	I mean, the sales that they got are deserved.
1767208	1783799	They deserve the lack of sales that they got, and I hope there's a lot of refunds too, because honestly, I understand that there's teams and stuff that are working on this, but someone needs to be held accountable, and unfortunately it's not going to be the CEOs or the managers or whatever, but they are the ones accountable.
1783839	1786201	They knew the state that the game was in when they released it.
1786241	1790364	They did it anyways because they want to hit their metrics so they get their money.
1790404	1792345	They don't care about everybody else, and then that's it.
1792765	1795686	Let me get a couple other comments in chat and then I want to get into our gaming weeks here.
1795726	1799407	But y'all are on fire in chat tonight over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
1799847	1809911	SheHulk10 says, I think the crash is happening because there are too many great games and people that can normally afford to buy the games are not buying them because of the backlog of great games.
1810091	1813672	Well, yeah, and it's also the fact when you try to make one game last forever...
1814252	1817395	That's where your gaming time is going, is to that one game.
1817835	1819356	And, you know, that's followed up with some comments.
1819637	1821958	FifthDream says, my main game is Fallout 76.
1822299	1823159	It's that old now.
1823860	1828764	QuestBuster says, there's only so much time and money people can spread out on so many games.
1828864	1837651	A few months ago, there was that research report that noted 60% of time spent gaming was games six or more years old, like Fortnite with QuestBuster there.
1838052	1838893	Look at Loki.
1839453	1840094	Look at Loki.
1840734	1841875	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1841895	1842756	What did you play this week?
1843036	1843876	Oh, Minecraft?
1844157	1844917	You don't say!
1845998	1851582	And I'm just giving you shit, but it is also an obvious, like, that game is old!
1851902	1854524	That game is the classic game of the week at this point!
1854965	1857367	But it's still... There's a lot of new code in there.
1857387	1865573	Yes, yes, but that's still an example of a game that is getting those constant updates to keep the money kind of coming in and people hooked.
1865953	1868475	And it keeps people from playing other games.
1871109	1900073	and it's no different DarkSakura and Dead by Daylight myself and Diablo 4 and Final Fantasy 14 about evenly we've all got our vice somewhere like it's that's the nature of this industry that we're in right now and Bobby Blackwolf I'm going to add the final say on this because I think this is on point broken games are what you get when you rely too much on chat GPT yes
1905230	1927444	I would never encourage the vandalizing of gaming studios I would never encourage that but in a video game like let's say I was playing Jet Set Future in a video game if I had a thing of graffiti I would want to write that on the wall of where the CEO works broken games are what you get when you rely too much on chat GBT
1929192	1929472	Print.
1929753	1931074	Put that on the back of the box.
1931575	1932976	Put that on the back of the industry.
1933236	1934918	Tattoo it on the industry's ass.
1937881	1939643	On that note, let's talk about our gaming weeks.
1940945	1943067	What did you play this week, broken or not?
1943107	1944669	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1945982	1947102	It was kind of minimal.
1947583	1963109	I played Pollya, I played Dead by Daylight, but I didn't really play much of anything else because Rosh Hashanah happened, and then, you know, Fuck It Friday happened, and then...
1965473	1967214	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1983858	2010102	um so I I haven't really felt like because most of the stuff I play is on stream so I haven't really felt like putting on my headphones and I'm on Benadryl so I haven't really felt like playing anything but um you know just just doing the usual maybe a couple of um like easy SNES games I've been playing too and of course a Suika game so nice all right Loki how was your gaming week
2011181	2026649	um well as you said it was just Minecraft but there were some things I did I promise I'm not being shady you do you do actually you play Minecraft a lot because you are a multimedia Minecraft producer and you do great stuff so of course you spend a lot of time playing it
2027349	2029171	This week, yeah, I was testing out.
2029491	2033534	They released the snapshot for the new update, so I was checking out some of that stuff.
2034375	2035476	Not much to really say there.
2035496	2036436	It's still very early.
2036817	2038798	But the main thing this week was KubeCon.
2038858	2043722	So KubeCon is a virtual convention for Minecraft that's in Minecraft.
2044603	2048246	And they hold it about once a year around October, around this time.
2048626	2049787	And so we had a booth there.
2049867	2053490	And so we were kind of supporting that for charity, for the...
2054771	2057072	I'm trying to remember what the charity now is called.
2057653	2061916	It's the CubeCon charity though, but they raised like $16,000 for all that.
2062636	2063617	Oh wow, I love that though.
2064277	2065278	Yeah, yeah, that's pretty fun.
2065318	2068781	So we have like a virtual booth so you can visit, they have like talks.
2069081	2071282	That's so fucking adorable, like I love that.
2071442	2077567	Like what a very, how very 2020, but I also love, like I just love that concept.
2078339	2087882	Yeah, and they build, like, they have a virtual hall and everything, and, like, you can actually, like, get a hotel room and hold parties there if you want and stuff like that.
2088062	2089042	Can you trash it?
2090383	2094404	I mean, yeah, you can kind of break stuff and, like, redesign everything.
2094464	2095885	So, in a sense, yes, you can.
2095905	2096885	Um...
2098531	2099452	and what else?
2099472	2107435	Yeah, so we did that for like three days and met a lot of people and just, you know, hung out and played some of the games that they had there and stuff.
2107995	2109176	But yeah, it was all right.
2109856	2110416	That sounds fun.
2111137	2112437	All right.
2112477	2119260	Well, if that's it for your gaming week, we'll go to my gaming week, which was quite a bit of Diablo 4 because the expansion is out on Tuesday.
2119921	2123923	If you can believe it, it's already here and the current season ends tomorrow.
2125143	2127164	And I, I'm really...
2127564	2128826	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2147166	2151529	and some of the companion builds you can do in that game where like, you know, the dogs are doing all the fighting for you.
2151629	2162076	So like, you know, Druid kind of has something like that, but boy, Druids get squishy towards the end game and I'm getting one hit killed and it is frustrating the hell out of me.
2162556	2164138	But I'm finally kind of
2164918	2166240	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2181238	2183740	Let's play a mode where if I die, it's over.
2184381	2188144	So I played Hardcore, which is the first time I've done in Diablo 4 actually this entire time.
2188164	2193629	But I did a Barbarian and I'm specifically doing like a Thorns build that makes it very hard for you to die.
2194529	2195791	So that's been kind of fun.
2195811	2202676	But I only got that up to about level 35 before I just decided I was just going to suck it up with the Druid and finish off the season.
2204038	2206219	But yeah, the expansion is out this week and I'm very excited about it.
2207340	2209281	The other thing I've been doing is retro games.
2209762	2213664	I made good on my promise last week to dive into playing and streaming some retro games.
2214645	2217887	I was kind of being a little sly about what was the game I was going to do first.
2218227	2229494	It was Balloon Fight was the game I played first, which was, of course, a reason why I love to pick that game first is because that was the game that Iwata worked on before he was the CEO of Nintendo.
2230294	2236418	And so I love that concept of like a lot of the great names you know from Nintendo's history were kind of involved in
2236878	2238779	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2253226	2257069	It actually shows you what rank you are on the leaderboard as you play and I was never able to get to one.
2257129	2258430	I got to one when we were on stream.
2258790	2261352	So I played that and then I let the chat vote on what we did next.
2261372	2265475	So we played Pimbot, the 8-bit version of Pimbot, for better or for worse.
2265875	2267897	There's some things that that translation did very well.
2267937	2269358	There's some things that translation did kind of...
2269958	2270979	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2285675	2312825	I played start to finish in one stream it took me about four and a half hours and I shit you not probably the last hour and a half of that was me struggling on level nine because I could not remember where anything was and that level is nasty because there's like essentially warps all over or like those rooms where it's like oh if you go down this ladder and go up that you turn out in a completely different place it just took me forever to find my way around that but I got there eventually and beat it
2313365	2336852	so that felt really good so yeah if you want to see the archives I'm trying to build up YouTube again with some of the archives so Rob Roberts Plays on YouTube Rob Roberts Plays just Rob Roberts on Twitch but Rob Roberts Plays on YouTube alright that was pretty much it for my gaming week next week Diablo 4 expansion and more retro I can already tell you I know what games I want to play next
2337772	2364886	um let's get into some more gaming news I don't have anything else to talk about here at the top of the show so let's get into some more gaming news Loki you want to start us off yes so Microsoft is now uh turned to asking game devs why don't you like us why won't you make Xbox games come on guys we're cool why won't you do that um so they're actually now um trying to uh
2365566	2372928	I guess I send out surveys to different developers asking them, hey, if you're making video games, we're interested in hearing from you.
2375529	2377949	If you aren't on Xbox, we'd love to know why.
2377989	2383171	And honestly, if you're using our competitors' products, you probably have a great perspective we could learn from.
2384371	2388094	They're hoping to gain fresh perspectives and avoid becoming an echo chamber.
2389014	2392177	It's a bit like testing players who play games like yours.
2392617	2401283	They're your target audience and you want to hear fresh perspectives because their expectations may differ from folks who are deep in your community.
2402644	2408508	But, of course, there are some obvious possible answers for that.
2409148	2410429	One being that, you know,
2412067	2421451	Game Pass isn't really promoting players to basically buy Xbox hardware but not games.
2422071	2423332	Low hardware sales.
2424772	2431475	Also requiring games to be released on both the Xbox Series S and X might pose a problem as well.
2432155	2432415	So...
2434196	2441305	I guess we'll have to wait and see what comes out of this if we ever hear anything because, I mean, Microsoft's going to be getting the information.
2441705	2442906	I doubt they'll be sharing it.
2443267	2446711	Hey guys, we found out the devs don't like us because our consoles suck.
2446771	2448413	Here's the list of top 10 reasons.
2448813	2451637	We asked 100 people and the top 7 are on the board.
2454125	2463370	They really like the ray tracing that's on the Sony PlayStation 5, and they really like the wireless motion controls of the Switch controller.
2463390	2465711	Yeah, they're not going to come out and say all that stuff.
2465751	2467012	I'm sorry, that's not going to happen.
2468013	2471795	Basically, it does come off as a little bit desperate, but at the same time,
2472910	2473010	Yeah.
2473050	2473170	Yeah.
2495862	2496743	What do you think it is?
2496963	2499685	I think the Xbox Series S is a serious thing.
2500126	2501667	Yeah, I think it's that.
2501767	2505350	And I've heard people say they should just drop support for that, but here's the thing.
2505790	2510714	The Series S is a big part of the reason why Microsoft is doing as well as they are right now.
2510915	2519982	It does make an attractive budget console to allow people to play next-gen games without necessarily having to drop $700 on a PS5 Pro in order to do it.
2522644	2530667	Then they may just have to stream it, like have it so that the Xbox Series S supports these games, but only in streaming.
2530687	2539531	The problem is, though, that that communication to players, it's going to be a little bit convoluted, I guess, and there could be a lot of confusion on the consumer side.
2539631	2549895	I'm also very much of the mindset, if you're making games for the Switch still, you can make a game for the Xbox Series S. Like, the S is still more powerful than a Nintendo Switch, which is still...
2550515	2554778	You know, going all this time later, we still do not have a Switch successor.
2554798	2556980	I think a lot of development is on the Switch successor now.
2557020	2561484	I think that is the worst kept secret of all the trust me bro people out there.
2561564	2567789	That said though, like the Switch successor probably going to be about as powerful as an Xbox Series S, I would imagine.
2567949	2569390	Actually, that's a very good point.
2569650	2570691	That's a very good point.
2571292	2574835	So, and we know, we already know the Nintendo Switch successor is...
2575595	2593157	is very likely to sell oodles and oodles like they're gonna have to like really have a screwy price or like fuck this up colossally somehow I just don't see that happening I really don't like we're not gonna have a Wii U situation there's a reason everybody's calling this the Switch 2
2594378	2598980	Nintendo, even though that's probably not going to be the name, Nintendo knows the formula that works now.
2599380	2602922	And if you think about it, the Wii U was really the first step in that direction.
2603242	2604883	It just wasn't there yet.
2605483	2608765	So Nintendo knows the formula now and they're not going to deviate from it.
2610230	2614532	Yeah, Mike Deft says people are buying a Series S not because they want the greatest graphics.
2614952	2616832	They want it to be able to play games.
2617193	2619053	Yeah, and that's it at the end of the day.
2619353	2629137	DJ Ranma S has some other suggestions in chat here talking about get rid of the Series S or at least make it with the same specs as the X with half the memory and storage.
2629637	2633538	I get that, and you could probably do that to an extent with how technology is getting cheaper.
2633598	2639100	You could probably release a stronger version of the Xbox Series S. What about all the people that already have one?
2640984	2654965	that's that's where you start to walk a slippery slope and I again I'm gonna say if you're developing for Nintendo you can develop for a Series S but you know yeah once you get past a certain point it gets harder and harder that's for sure um
2656090	2658071	No more day one releases of games.
2658271	2662892	Stagger the release of first party games to get people and buy an Xbox.
2663312	2667514	Let the Xbox team actually work and do what works and upper management should let them be.
2667554	2668874	Well, that I will agree with.
2669314	2671335	Number three, that's for sure.
2671795	2676796	The day one releases of games, that's a tricky one because they really want Game Pass.
2677216	2679537	They really want Game Pass to be a thing.
2680017	2681338	But I would agree...
2682358	2704666	to an extent they ought to try a little more the movie formula and let something cook for a little while maybe six months on the market before they move it on to game pass but I fully understand the game pass is going to lose a lot of value if you do that and it's going to be harder to justify these price increases for game pass so they need to get more old shit on game pass
2705578	2727866	right and that's why they're pushing the highest tier now is where you can get those day one games not any of the lower tiers so that's why they're doing that still it's because of the additional revenue that they're going to get from that and yeah some games aren't day one on Game Pass and then they eventually come to that later on but I think they have to do it that way right now
2728870	2730531	Actually, I have a question about Game Pass.
2730551	2732012	It was a while ago in chat.
2732533	2734634	SheHulk, sorry, this was like 20 minutes ago.
2734694	2740018	SheHulk10 said a while ago, Starfield is a great single player game.
2740558	2743900	And that did make me think about that expansion for Starfield that came out.
2743940	2746322	You may or may not be aware, Starfield got an expansion.
2746722	2756208	And my understanding is Bethesda is trying to respond to some of the criticism Starfield got about the, yeah, it has a thousand planets, but it's a thousand soulless planets.
2756749	2758250	I'm generalizing the criticism.
2759271	2765756	What they tried to do with this expansion is they handmade one planet.
2766457	2767738	There's an intent behind that, Loki.
2767838	2777607	It's to make it feel like a Fallout or Elder Scrolls type of game because it's designed with intent so the exploration feels a little more meaningful.
2778307	2795400	it's almost like they didn't need all those extra planets is what it sounds like that's exactly what I'm saying is the main criticism of the game as it was but they're trying to shift things a little bit I have heard good things about the expansion but my curiosity is did they put the expansion on Game Pass or no?
2795800	2802666	because I'm thinking they didn't I might get a discount but yeah, I don't know interesting
2803746	2804086	I don't know
2830835	2834039	SheHulk10 says the graphics race is over now.
2834199	2836142	It's time to make great games.
2838986	2840608	I agree mostly.
2841678	2846220	It's going to be very interesting to see how the PlayStation 5 Pro ultimately does.
2846280	2855763	Because I really feel like gaming media, a lot of sites, the big sites online, they keep pushing this whole, oh, the PS5 Pro is up to supporting 60 games now.
2856083	2857864	Look at all this stuff the PS5 Pro can do.
2857884	2863126	And I'm still kind of sitting here going, I don't think that's going to necessarily translate into sales.
2864673	2878416	I still feel like that bar is way too high on the PlayStation 5 Pro to really... But if that system does sell well, then that's going to say, yeah, people do still really care about graphics.
2879416	2890219	But you look at a lot of shit that's popular today, Minecraft, Among Us, Vampire Survivor, none of these games are known for their graphics.
2890239	2890359	Right?
2892279	2896761	As long as the gameplay is rock fucking solid, people are gonna show up.
2897582	2899483	But again, I think it's a little bit of both.
2899643	2903324	I think a really pretty game can draw people to your game.
2903465	2913189	I think that's why Final Fantasies are still a mainstay of the JRPG genre, even when they do games that are quite mediocre, quite frankly, like XV.
2914910	2916991	Some would argue XVI is kind of mediocre too.
2917431	2917571	XVI...
2919318	2921419	16 is a little more upset.
2921459	2922279	It's Peaks and Valleys.
2922480	2924741	16 is a little more of a case of Peaks and Valleys for me.
2925581	2932284	The opening, the demo, I'm telling you, if you've never played the first three hours of 16, there's a demo on PS5.
2932404	2934165	That same demo is now on PC.
2934545	2936166	That is a peak for 16.
2936947	2940208	Play that because that's about as high of a peak as that game gets.
2940828	2946131	Not that the rest is bad, but there's some really good parts still, but it kind of goes Peaks and Valleys, Peaks and Valleys, Peaks and Valleys.
2949540	2950220	I'm reading more.
2950260	2952861	SheHulk says Shattered Space DLC is beautiful.
2952921	2955762	I have heard it is a very good looking game.
2956662	2963123	Mike Def says Game Pass opens the door for someone trying something new and that they probably wouldn't get otherwise.
2964223	2963123	100%.
2964823	2972085	That way, like you're saying, interest will decrease and either you buy the game day one because you really want it or like I said, just wait for a sale at that point.
2973185	3000878	uh DJ Ranma S says interest isn't going to wane let's be real if Microsoft said they were going to release their titles to Game Pass 30 days after release it's not going to be an issue at all what happens with a game now this was not a Microsoft game but what happens with a game like Concord a game that flops in seven days but see Concord's biggest problem is it should have been a Game Pass game I know wrong company you all know I understand but let's be real Concord should have been a Game Pass game
3002639	3005984	Concord should have been a Sony Game Pass game for Microsoft.
3006524	3007826	Okay, that makes no sense.
3007946	3008307	I get it.
3008387	3009068	It makes no sense.
3009348	3011811	But that's what that is.
3012312	3014435	So it should have been a PlayStation Plus giveaway game.
3014495	3014956	We'll say that.
3016172	3017773	All right, let's move on.
3018133	3019253	Let's talk about Nintendo.
3037481	3043604	So you can go and watch those games, but spoiler alert, if you're going to go looking for these speedruns, be prepared.
3043704	3044724	Spoiler, spoiler, spoilers.
3045404	3052367	Apparently, a Twitch streamer by the name of OnakuTV got through the game in 52 minutes and 51 seconds.
3053768	3056669	And apparently, a sub-50 is within reach.
3056809	3061111	And the article I'm peeking at is from Wednesday, so for all I know, they've already gotten under 50.
3061912	3064113	That's pretty impressive for a game that just came out.
3064233	3064533	But...
3065353	3090737	apparently it also doesn't surprise me because apparently some of the things people are saying about echoes of wisdom is that certain echoes like break the game like certain echoes are like like um it's even coming across my TikTok I saw a TikTok that was like if you get the spider in the first area that spider thing lets you go anywhere you can climb up walls and do like whatever and it's very and then apparently the bed is the most powerful item in the entire game that's what I'm hearing
3091377	3092938	So but it's it's interesting.
3092978	3107284	I mean, and honestly, it's not out of character with the more recent big budgets or big budget looking Zelda games, because I feel like a lot of those other they're they're easily solvable with certain tricks with the magnets and the things that are available in that game, too.
3107404	3110605	So, you know, it's it's on it's on theme.
3112473	3139061	apparently also contributing to why this game is getting by so quick there is a sequence breaking warp glitch and if you want to know more about that it is on reddit in rspeedrun but warning that will involve visiting reddit in its current form but you do you do I don't know how much I want to say but you summon a particular echo after completing the first dungeon and you do a warp mechanic that takes you right to the end so you know
3140387	3142748	Hey, is that any different from Super Mario Bros.
3143068	3143929	3 and the warp whistles?
3144049	3144489	Not really.
3144909	3146410	So it's just a different way of doing it.
3146550	3149491	So check that out if you want.
3150151	3158815	Also on the Zelda Echoes of Wisdom front, apparently there is a way that you can actually exploit a glitch.
3159255	3163938	So you could be cloaked Link in the very beginning of Echoes of Wisdom.
3164238	3166819	So minor spoiler, but it is the very beginning.
3167319	3168960	You get to play as Cloak Link.
3169540	3173924	Well, of course, somebody figured out here's how to play the entire game as Cloaked Link.
3174364	3179168	And basically, once you get through the first dungeon, you do a very similar type of glitch.
3179949	3193200	And once you get to the game over screen, you restart the game as Link rather than Zelda, which, you know, kind of ruins the whole purpose because now you have Link's weapons, the sword, the shield, arrows, bombs.
3193880	3196102	Your progress is completely reset, but, you know,
3197223	3197563	and DarkSakura.
3223072	3228977	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3246983	3255605	Oh yeah, so there's a lot more going on with Ubisoft and their stock in particular.
3256125	3261246	Their shares have jumped more than 30% as of this past Friday.
3262326	3274208	This is following some reports that Tencent and the Gamalt family are considering doing a full buyout.
3276449	3285557	Right now they are minority stakeholders and they've been working on trying to stabilize the company after, of course, it lost half of its market share.
3287498	3292042	And so right now their shares have surged up 33.5% to $15.57 a share.
3300669	3328020	now they've been trying to reach out for comment Ubisoft and Tencent did not say anything but I don't know I think that this is them trying to prevent the company leaving the family which means we'd be stuck with Gimel forever ever but I mean
3329645	3331826	It's just a little bit more to add to it.
3331906	3332707	We'll see what happens.
3333788	3336629	It is very interesting that this is on the table.
3336769	3344694	I mean, as much as I hate it, from their perspective, they're meaning the Gimans, it is the very logical counter move here.
3344874	3351979	But it also shows that there is some very, like, there is credibility to this notion that people...
3352839	3353679	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3383283	3384143	I would want to save it.
3386344	3389445	You know, I'm just going to throw that little bit out there.
3389865	3392146	Yeah, again, from their perspective, I get it.
3392606	3394026	You know, it's it is a lot.
3394066	3401929	But I just I'm surprised that this that what's going on is serious enough that they are considering that countermeasure.
3402029	3407491	That's just kind of surprising, because I think last week when we were talking about it was kind of like, oh, you know, it's an activist.
3407531	3408751	He's only got 10 percent.
3408791	3409211	It's interesting.
3409251	3411132	It's happening, but it's probably not going to go anywhere.
3412162	3412302	Yeah.
3412322	3412582	We'll see.
3412622	3412842	And maybe...
3434702	3460335	as much as I keep saying he needs to be done maybe the solution is that they do take Ubisoft and then Ubisoft can rot that's it like and that sucks I'm sorry for the people that work there there's a lot of hard-working people you know that just but it's just one of those at that point I just don't know that I would ever be able to buy a game from them ever again yeah I mean
3460851	3464274	I can't think of anything that I've really purchased from them in a while.
3464474	3466535	Which I don't think will be hard to do.
3469337	3469738	Apparently.
3470018	3470899	Actually, that's a boycott.
3470939	3473701	I think I played an Assassin's Creed game on Game Pass.
3474021	3476122	I played Assassin's Creed Odyssey on Game Pass.
3476523	3478704	That was the last Ubisoft game I think I actually played.
3479825	3482207	Avatar game that I had already paid for.
3484709	3486390	Honestly, I super love it.
3487451	3488051	I'm not going to lie.
3488091	3488692	It's a great game.
3490033	3490213	But
3492577	3492857	All right.
3493658	3494379	Well, let's move on.
3494499	3497742	Let's talk about maybe things happening to smaller labels.
3497802	3498022	Loki.
3499551	3508194	Yep, so Devolver Digital has launched a big fan games label for indie developed licensed games.
3508334	3514697	When it comes to licensed games, they say we think there's room for a new approach, one where indie developers get to make the call.
3516037	3519358	So that could be a variety of properties.
3520179	3528562	They said from a team that Dune, Star Wars, Blade Runner, Lord of the Rings, Hellboy, Evil Dead, John Wick, Blair Witch, Power Rangers, and more.
3529542	3553398	um that sounds interesting I'd be curious to see like some smaller indie studios take on some of these titles that said however not all indie studios producing licensed games works out great like Golem or uh that King Kong game that came out
3555592	3581663	King Kong Skull Island so they're not all going to be winners but I would assume that Devolver Digital has a lot more quality control than say some of these other studios so I would trust them a little more than somebody can step in and say yo a King Kong game in 2024 probably not it somebody can step in and say maybe you shouldn't alright yeah
3582771	3584553	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3601252	3621853	I'll play with y'all He still owes me a game of Dead by Daylight I'm going to have to cash that in because I think I bought it for him on Steam it was like $6 or $7 during a sale and I was like now you have no excuse but I played Foam Stars on the street and again the game's not bad where the mistake was made was charging money up front for it once it was off it's
3622654	3623555	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3651721	3658010	the industry spoke loud and clear and I think Foamstar's initial I don't want to say flop but initial kind of
3659506	3666790	Soft Floop on the Pillow in regards to what it made in the marketplace is a testament to that.
3667170	3669932	Well, now Foam Stars is officially free to play.
3670532	3675755	So if you want to go in there and check it out now on PlayStation 4 and 5, you can go in.
3675815	3679937	That also means you do not need PlayStation Plus, which is another huge change.
3680297	3685020	Being that it is now in the free-to-play category, you actually don't need PS Plus to be able to play it online.
3685060	3686901	That could be a huge game changer for some people.
3687601	3698892	If you did buy the game originally, you get a legacy gift with 12 color variant Bubble Beastie skins, whatever that is, a new slideboard design, and a legacy title in the game.
3699593	3701995	Those are all available to people who had the game originally.
3702435	3705518	So now that is open to all.
3705538	3708921	And of course, Foam Stars was kind of like Splatoon, but...
3709562	3710984	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3733366	3758557	but I would say it's worth a look especially now that it's free to play so this is a good call for the game we'll just see if it's too little too late because I'm not sure there's going to be a lot of people talking about Foam Stars after this week it needs to build up the community it needs to build up the streams and all that type of stuff for people to give a hoot about Foam Stars so we'll see what happens in the next week DarkSakura, what do you have next for us?
3760120	3761001	Oh, this and that.
3761681	3769666	Predominantly, apparently something wanting me to sell all of my stuff to them.
3771227	3781633	Anyway, there is going to be an unofficial Genesis or Mega Drive port of Ladder House.
3784335	3806608	Monster Bath Games that did Death Wish Enforcers and Guard Grave have been putting aside their own stuff to do a fan-made port of Splatterhouse and they were going to be using the Scorpion engine to bring the arcade version over
3808929	3811952	So, I think it'll be interesting.
3811992	3816175	Yeah, the only thing that came out for Mega Drive was Splatterhouse 2 and Splatterhouse 3.
3816355	3817797	Those did get official releases.
3818397	3819858	I think it's going to be pretty fun.
3819978	3822581	I hope no one, you know, sends them a C&D.
3823642	3825683	But, yeah, Splatterhouse.
3827305	3831908	Yeah, an appropriate piece of news for October, that's for sure.
3831928	3833950	Go ahead.
3837226	3842459	Apparently, Splatterhouse also got a release for Analog Pocket.
3844124	3844545	Really?
3845327	3845607	Yeah.
3846656	3847276	I missed that.
3848437	3850417	So, let's see.
3850698	3853999	DarkTetsuya in chat says, it's definitely impressive the little bit I saw of it.
3854079	3856520	Surprised it never made it to Genesis or Mega Drive.
3856600	3856840	Yeah.
3857920	3862422	I'm assuming that was a licensing or system rights holder related reason why.
3862862	3866884	Because 2 and 3 would have been after the TurboGrafx was kind of off the market, right?
3867904	3868624	Yeah.
3870445	3871105	Yeah.
3871986	3872686	So maybe that's why.
3874042	3874382	All right.
3874702	3881006	Well, going from ports to other things that we know companies don't like, right, Loki?
3881986	3882727	Well, yeah.
3883387	3887289	So Nintendo has gone after yet another Switch emulator.
3887809	3896454	So Ryujinx is now actually CCing to offer their emulator downloads.
3897394	3901276	and have removed the code along with that.
3901996	3915481	It says, yesterday, GDK Chan, who is the Ryu Jinx creator, was contacted by Nintendo and offered an agreement to stop working on the project, remove the organization and all related assets he's in control of.
3917955	3934690	as well as while waiting confirmation on whether he would take this agreement the organization has been removed I think it's safe to say we know what the outcome is so basically they said take it down or we're going to sue you essentially I think and so not wanting to fight a lawsuit you know
3937557	3939541	Yeah, once on the internet, always on the internet, right?
3939782	3940663	True, true.
3940764	3948580	But, you know, it's not going to be getting any more updates or anything like that unless, you know, someone forks the code for that or backed up all that stuff, which they may have.
3948780	3949001	Yeah.
3949605	3951786	Yeah, so it'll be interesting to see.
3974921	3997793	but the tricky part is when it comes to new games like yes we can talk about games preservation that's important and yes we can talk about homebrew that's important but the reality is when Nintendo is actively selling Switch stuff including like Echoes of Wisdom right and other things that are going to be their major holiday titles and how Nintendo is making its money this holiday season Nintendo is going to actively shut this shit down especially when they see whether
3999694	4008681	Intentional or not, it goes back to that whole rule of sometimes the truth doesn't matter, it's what's perceived that matters.
4009261	4016626	And when you have that emulator next to Echoes of Wisdom, ready to download now, that perception?
4017247	4018268	Not good.
4019423	4045035	and Nintendo's gonna go after that because they see that as an attack on their wallet and their rights and all that stuff which I mean when it comes to like stuff that they kind of have a right to do that you know I want to support emulators and again I stand by everything I said on the last video like modders have done so and I put emulator designers in with like the modder community and this have done so much for the community especially when it comes to game preservation and playing these games that would otherwise be lost to time
4045635	4074120	but maybe you just kind of have to keep that a little bit close to your chest until Nintendo moves on to the next system which to be fair Nintendo has waited way too long to do and I think that's what's made this very interesting well people would say well Rob the Switch is still selling and I would say you have a point but yeah what's making this very interesting is that of course the Switch is being emulated it's been on the market for nine fucking years
4074680	4077963	9 years and also the hardware wasn't very powerful to begin with.
4078023	4086329	So like, for example, now they have, you know, with the developer was working on iOS ports of the emulator.
4086389	4089572	They had an Android port that's already running Mario Kart 8.
4089792	4090332	Wow.
4090413	4093455	So like the fact that you can run Mario Kart 8 on a phone.
4095862	4098704	Oh yeah, Nintendo hates that.
4099424	4101345	So yeah, they're going to shut it down.
4103247	4112913	But I think it's also a sign that this is why Nintendo needs to step it up on their hardware and get to the next system because this is not going away for them.
4113354	4121059	I mean, yeah, they're going to get it taken down publicly, but I guarantee, I guarantee, A, that code has been forked.
4121499	4139772	B, there are Discord servers running underground where people are still editing, updating, changing, and making that code work so that when the day comes when Nintendo moves on to the next system and they don't have their eyes on the Switch original anymore, they're going to go put that a little more out there.
4139792	4140293	Hey, look at this.
4140313	4141133	Yeah, hey, look at this.
4143315	4143475	So...
4145154	4152186	or actually when it'll be when the support for the original Switch gets pulled.
4153117	4154117	Which will happen someday.
4154657	4156738	Look at Wii U. Look at 3DS.
4157338	4158418	It'll happen someday.
4159019	4165420	And when the Switch support inevitably gets pulled, here's the emulator we've been working on in secret this whole time.
4165720	4170262	And at that point, they're going to be heroes in every regard because, yay, game preservation.
4170322	4170802	You did it.
4171122	4179224	You made it so that all these... I mean, maybe the Switch 2 will be backwards compatible with all the Switch stuff so it will feel like less of a need.
4180168	4205392	but um there's still gonna be you know there's gonna be games that just for whatever reason the online servers get pulled or whatever let's say something like Mario Maker 2 the online servers get pulled or whatever and they're lost to time if it's not for emulators and other ways of uh running these types of things all right anyway let's move on DarkSakura so um
4208693	4209795	Wait, no, it's me.
4209875	4210415	Just kidding.
4212678	4213358	You know what's funny?
4213919	4217983	I originally had given you this story, and then I was like, I think she'd like the Splatterhouse one better.
4218984	4221086	Yeah, I do like the Splatterhouse one.
4221106	4221447	Thank you.
4222548	4223929	Originally, you had this one, though.
4223949	4225651	That's why my brain was like, you're talking about it.
4225671	4226232	But no, you're not.
4226352	4226592	I am.
4227053	4228955	I was like, shouldn't I be talking about...
4230563	4232566	Something that never came to pass?
4232626	4234129	Yes, we will get to that shortly.
4234169	4238475	But first, let's talk about something that is coming to pass, whether you like it or not.
4238576	4243984	It's a new arcade one-up machine, like the ones I have behind me as we're broadcasting live.
4244044	4245366	Except this one is not a game.
4246347	4247227	in the traditional sense.
4247908	4250848	Arcade 1-Up is putting out a claw machine.
4251349	4252269	Yes, they are.
4252749	4255730	Well, I guess you know what to get your husband for Christmas.
4255750	4256870	I already joked with him.
4256950	4259931	I said, Alan, do I need to get you a claw machine for Christmas?
4259991	4261972	And his reaction was, absolutely not.
4262932	4264092	Dan knows what to get me.
4264132	4267513	What are you talking about?
4267553	4269134	We just don't have the room in this place.
4269374	4270234	If we had a different place.
4270254	4270894	Well, not that I do either.
4271294	4272095	Yeah, but...
4273736	4277658	Arcade1Up is actually going to be putting out a claw machine.
4278019	4280140	It's going to be a 66 inch high machine.
4280200	4284522	It's going to cost $499 and pre-sales have begun.
4286043	4288405	The claw machine actually has different modes.
4288805	4292507	There is easy mode, normal mode, and scam mode.
4293047	4293568	Gotcha pun.
4309665	4336127	yeah but that for like the claw machine it actually comes with 12 of those so if you if you have parties regularly this is the type of thing that like a party like people that host corporate parties and stuff should have one of these on the dolly because that would be a really fun thing I think people would be into for parties do that do I need one in my house I don't know about that but no I do no I no I certainly do not and I'll just come over and play it all the time
4337876	4339716	Jokes on you, I set mine to scam mode.
4343438	4345239	And every time you play, I say, give me a dollar.
4346019	4349381	And when you open the capsule, there's a piece of paper in it.
4349521	4352883	And then when you open the piece of paper, it says F-U-K-U.
4357685	4359086	Just so you can open it up and be like, Rab!
4361519	4361839	Rob.
4362540	4363260	This is crap.
4363280	4366902	Mine's just going to be nothing but a mile long sheet.
4367042	4376167	It's going to be a CVS receipt piece of paper that's just covered in... You know what I would really put in those prize capsules?
4376647	4381730	I would put the fucking plushies that Alan wins from playing, or has won, but I think he stopped playing as much.
4382010	4388794	But I would put the plushies that Alan actually won from playing these claw machines on whatever website he would
4389874	4391275	He used to stream it when he was streaming.
4391315	4392495	He had a website.
4392515	4394315	I need to look at that website again.
4394395	4396036	I've spent an age.
4396876	4398056	I don't remember what it is.
4398416	4400557	I don't remember either, and it's probably for the best that I don't.
4401357	4403878	But anyway, check that out.
4404018	4408519	If you are that into claw machines, you can now have your very own.
4408599	4410320	I do think it's really funny, to be honest.
4412314	4415496	Pod Culture says $500 and it doesn't even have prizes.
4416016	4418758	The prizes were the friends we lost along the way.
4422460	4422860	All right.
4423120	4427603	Well, let's move back to a simpler time and a time when things didn't even happen.
4427643	4436048	You know, we're going to do the segment called the Classic Game of the Week, but once a month in the year 2024, DarkSakura tells us about a game that actually never happened.
4436088	4438009	It's a figment of your imagination.
4438629	4439530	So let's get to the bumper.
4450310	4457595	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4458076	4460618	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4462581	4466243	DarkSakura, what did you pick for the cancelled game of the month?
4467164	4486476	I picked Sonic Xtreme Yep, Sonic Xtreme It was a platformer that was developed by Sega Technical Institute starting in 1994 until it was cancelled in 1996 It was initially supposed to be the first fully 3D Sonic the Hedgehog game
4487116	4489998	to bring Sonic into the modern era.
4490439	4496964	And it was the only original, sorry, the first original Sonic game for Sega Saturn.
4498305	4509394	You basically were following Sonic on his ship to keep Eggman from stealing six magic rings from a character literally called Tiara Bubowski.
4509855	4510895	Boob-owski.
4511276	4511756	And her father.
4512597	4513037	Bubowski.
4513077	4513317	Love it.
4514898	4537808	you had open levels that rotated around a fixed sphere center area and you could get rings and it was supposed to be pretty fast but it was initially conceived as a side-scrolling game for the Genesis that was supposed to succeed Sonic & Knuckles and then Sega did their little shifteroo to the 32X and the game came with it
4538308	4562169	and then they worked on it for Saturn in Windows and then it got completely redesigned again to be intended to be released for the 1996 holiday season but you know stuff happens and there was a a visit by the Japanese Sega executives there were problems with game engines
4563918	4577553	including using one that came from Sonic Team that was used in Nights and finally with the designer and main programmer becoming sick
4578772	4580933	It actually was cancelled.
4581013	4585214	There was even a film tie-in with MGM Studios, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.
4586575	4599659	So instead what happened is Sega released a port of Sonic 3D Blast, a Genesis game, but there was not another original Sonic game until Sonic Adventure came out on the Dreamcast.
4601570	4601730	and, uh,
4632934	4633386	it uh
4635371	4641675	A lot of the factors in here really seem like they made it into Sonic Adventure a little bit later.
4642235	4658884	It was very similar to playing Bug on Saturn, but that you had basically free roam, you had no linear path, and it used a fisheye camera system called the Reflex Lens that gives you a wide-angle view that moves around Sonic.
4660044	4663106	The levels rotate around the center so that you could run up
4663566	4664526	and so on.
4691974	4719783	and so there were four stages that were developed before the game was cancelled like the Jade Gully, Red Sands, Galaxy Fortress and Crystal Frost there were four characters that were modeled and textured their designs were over 50 enemies and an hour of music created Fang the Sniper and Metal Sonic were considered to be for bosses
4722395	4737848	all kinds of stuff there were even promotional materials that were created that involved Miss Bubowski and her father Gazebo Bubowski interesting and then of course Eggman himself
4738909	4761266	um so just to go a little bit more into the background uh Yuji Naka and some of the Japanese staff moved to California for the Sega Technical Institute um that wanted to combine elements and philosophy of American and Japanese game design um they worked on Sonic the Hedgehog 2 uh
4763488	4788393	there were language barriers though and there was a bit of a rift that developed but a few people came and left and so the American staff did Sonic Spinball and the Japanese staff did Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles they had experimented with 3D graphics for Sonic 3 but could not implement them because the Genesis just couldn't knock it
4789533	4792917	Yuji Naka returned to Japan to work on Nights with Sonic Team.
4794939	4798763	And then, you know, things kind of just went downhill.
4799644	4804669	You know, there was even a statement that the Sega president...
4808540	4831159	Nakayama Hayao had really pushed hard on the American executives and thought that there were some bad decisions being made and things got really political after the PlayStation came out and people were pushing blame here and there and just sort of fell apart in the aftermath but
4833584	4839946	There were, I mean, there were game, just aspects of this that just went all the way through so many different revisions.
4840006	4844187	So I think it also fell into that area of developmental hell.
4844847	4856930	Apparently, when they were working on the development of Extreme, Naka came to visit and just said, good luck.
4858274	4886276	so the game was originally developed with two different game engines and they were using tools that were used in Panzer Dragoons Vi and some tools that had just been taken from a couple different other games and then they worked on making enemies and pre-rendered sprites and like I said, a lot of shifting around, a lot of idea changing and then
4890117	4893400	There was the dispute going on within Sega.
4893560	4895042	Like I said, there's just a lot of drama.
4895062	4898145	I'm not going to go full into the background of all of it.
4898805	4904891	There was a playable demo in May 1996 at E3.
4906092	4911978	And it used the engine that was created a lot later in there by...
4916764	4924796	One of the programmers and then they had actually taken that particular engine and decided that they were going to run with that instead.
4925577	4927720	So that's what this version was built around.
4930382	4955392	they were losing people left and right they were getting a lot of turnover and Coffin who developed that engine like I said earlier became really sick he had walking pneumonia and personally after having walking pneumonia myself yeah and the other one who became so sick they said that he had six months to live
4956653	4972069	but he recovered, I mean he's still alive but basically because the teams were just so just in such a state after all of that was going on that the decision was made to cancel the game
4973370	4980976	Um, now, um, it was announced in 1997 that it had been canceled.
4981016	4989342	So Sega put more focus on, uh, Nights into Dreams and the port of Sonic 3D Blast by Traveler's Tales.
4991744	4998149	Sonic Extreme was meant to be worked into bonus stages for 3D Blast, but they really couldn't do it.
4998189	5000771	They couldn't transfer Sonic's model over.
5001751	5009277	And then they worked on a version of this for the Dreamcast that did eventually become Sonic Adventure.
5009857	5014320	There are remnants of the prototype that can be seen in the game Sonic Jam.
5015641	5017703	Which, honestly, I'm kind of a fan of Sonic Jam.
5017723	5018203	It's just fun.
5018704	5018904	You know,
5019384	5047539	like a play around little game so like I said there was a film that was supposed to go with it and it was supposed to be live action and animation that was based on the world of Sonic and it was supposed to be called Sonic Wonders of the World there was a treatment that had been released that had Sonic and Robotnik escaping that world into the real world where have we seen that?
5051092	5077781	but like I said they had released the port of Sonic 3D Blast and we never really saw anything from it again except that all we had for a while was the different screenshots and then there was a copy of the early test engine that was sold in 2006 and someone put out like an animated gif of the gameplay
5078761	5104458	and then finally they had worked to try to buy the disc from that collector and the disc image was leaked online July 17, 2007 and then there was a site that was built around what they were able to get from there too and then I'm trying to find where the rest of this person's name is
5107873	5137422	it was another Sonic collector there's a lot on here but at any rate he wanted to actually complete the game himself but that didn't happen so there was a site in 2015, Sonic Retro that got the extreme source code and created a playable version that featured the levels that were shown in the E3 demo and then
5140726	5151518	It was pushed forward into a homebrew Saturn game that was based on Xtreme called Zonic Z-Stream in March 2017.
5154842	5159467	It's not listed here, but one of the ones that I found some video for was a Unity rebuild.
5160954	5163635	and it looked pretty neat.
5164456	5177641	But going back to ZStream, they took parts of Xtreme and his ideas and then played on them a little bit and got some really good nods for creativity and trying to do what they could with it.
5178581	5179101	But there you go.
5179362	5185664	This is the Unity rebuild now playing on the stream for those watching live so you can kind of see the difference.
5185724	5187525	It looks a little sharper, obviously, but yeah.
5189402	5199591	There's still a lot of the pop-in, which I think gives the game quite a number of opportunities of leaps of faith.
5200432	5202874	And yeah, I agree with Bonds006.
5202914	5204175	It looks pretty floaty.
5205536	5212562	I've played the older demo that had been released, and it was...
5214427	5215868	It's a little bit hard for me.
5216088	5220451	Pop-up kind of screws with my head, and it really did have that in abundance.
5221572	5221912	All right.
5222653	5223474	Well, there you have it.
5223994	5228317	Your classic cancelled game of the month.
5228497	5231879	Even Sonic is not immune to being cancelled, that's for sure.
5231940	5236162	But Sonic Extreme, your classically cancelled game.
5237231	5238372	of the month.
5238972	5239273	All right.
5240213	5246698	We are going to move on and cover some other headlines here real fast with some rapid fire news.
5247279	5249340	Loki, what else has been happening in gaming this week?
5250341	5260709	Parabonk Game Studio has confirmed that Saber Interactive is going to be working on a AAA RPG based off of Avatar The Last Airbender.
5261909	5267792	So it is, I'm assuming, targeting next year.
5267993	5273596	And they said they're calling it Avatar Legends or the Avatar Legends Universe.
5275217	5275977	It'll be cool to see.
5278159	5278579	And then...
5280069	5284131	Halo Infinite is getting a third person mode apparently next month.
5284931	5290134	This is coming from 343 Industries and they announced the update.
5290694	5305761	Didn't make the show roll because it is literally a last minute story but 343 Studios has been renamed to Halo Studios and they've just announced that they're going to be working on multiple Halo titles using the Unreal 5 engine.
5306101	5317129	and they showcased some of the graphics looks a lot better than when they first showed off Halo Infinite I'm going to tell you that much so look forward to more news on that coming soon
5318087	5334713	I know this is rapid fire, but I just wanted to dive a little bit in this because I found the third person mode thing fascinating because I think back, you know, DarkSakura, I know you don't tend to like to play games in first person because of motion sickness, although I guess EBD Killer kind of broke the mold for whatever reason.
5334813	5337935	But I still my first couple of games is killer.
5337975	5338835	I'm a little motion sick.
5339375	5368160	but I'm curious we joke about your relationship with Halo here in this game but you have to kind of look at this and go well that's kind of neat right like does this third person mode for Halo Infinite make you go I think it maybe could target like maybe it could target like people that play Fortnite a lot more because you know that's the same type of perspective that you have in like Fortnite I didn't think about that that's a good call out you're right it is maybe it's to like you know
5369091	5370192	I don't know, that's maybe a stretch.
5370232	5375194	Or just people that don't like, you know, there's a lot of people that don't like first-person pure.
5375675	5377276	And a lot of games have an option.
5377916	5380497	You know, like Mass Effect's another one that pops to mind.
5380517	5382238	You can play either way, if I remember right.
5382678	5383279	You can do either way.
5383919	5387941	I know the Bethesda games are one as well.
5388402	5391103	So most people play those in first-person, but you don't have to.
5391143	5392544	There's third-person available there, too.
5392604	5394945	So I just think it's interesting.
5394985	5397006	It's an interesting development for that.
5397046	5397186	But I...
5398447	5398707	DarkSakura
5416554	5431119	So there is a Games Done Quick fundraiser that will be helping the folks who are affected by Hurricane Helena on October 11th, starting at 6pm, and it will conclude on October 13th.
5435585	5458794	I know people personally who were affected by it so having that level of disaster relief will be the assistance will be really good for them the donations will be going directly to disaster I cannot make words happen it's the Benadryl it will go directly to the disaster relief
5459934	5488297	and I'm pretty pretty excited about it um I hope everyone tunes in and contributes whatever you can to help out yeah they're putting this together real fast too because I think the speedruns uh submissions are due in like an hour I guess I better work on my Zelda speedrun no but I think in all seriousness the speedrun submissions are due in an hour um and you know I you know we know Games Done Quick can do virtual stuff now so it is night because pretty infamously um
5489798	5493419	You know, Gamestone Quick really only does the two major marathons a year.
5493479	5501261	They do other things on their own channel, you know, but pretty infamously when it comes to the fundraisers and their charities are set in stone.
5501621	5506662	They always do Doctors Without Borders and they always do the Prevent Cancer Foundation.
5506962	5508662	Two very worthy causes.
5508742	5510883	I don't think any of us want to see those taken away from.
5511243	5516104	So it is really cool that the organization is doing this kind of like bonus stage, if you will.
5516864	5517665	for something necessary.
5517925	5521708	Now that I'm thinking about it, I'm like, oh, but they do the one at Twitch, and I think they do a charity for that.
5522008	5533336	So there are little other things that come up here and there, but for the most part... Oh, Bob Blackwell says, GDQ is doing a charity marathon this weekend for something else, so they started doing these little ones.
5533396	5537779	Well, that's cool, but obviously the Hurricane Helene...
5538559	5538899	Sucks.
5539160	5543084	So people, we need a lot of support for that one.
5543124	5547289	So hopefully some big names get in on that speed running.
5548490	5554316	DJ Ranma S says, my friend Jamie who lives in Asheville where it was hit the hardest is safe in Myrtle Beach.
5554496	5555577	She didn't lose everything.
5555597	5555798	Well, I'm
5556258	5556799	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5574682	5575583	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5593652	5601419	You know, obviously it sounds like a lot of the problem was that Hurricane Helene was doing some of its most damage in like mountainy areas and areas, not beach towns.
5601519	5605903	I mean, it damaged beach towns, but these beach towns are kind of used to hurricanes.
5605923	5606884	They're more prepared for it.
5607265	5610728	It was these other areas that weren't so prepared for it that were hit really hard.
5610748	5613250	It makes me think of a lot of like stuff we went through.
5613270	5614591	I mean, I shouldn't equate it.
5614631	5618075	One of my Florida friends sent me a picture of a boarded up Waffle House.
5618695	5620436	Yeah, that's when you know shit's real, right?
5620856	5622376	The Walthouse Index is real.
5622857	5625018	I will fully admit I shouldn't equate it.
5625178	5639343	And my point with this is that climate change is a bitch, but I can't help but think of some of these West Coast storms that we were getting close to home here last year that had the 70 miles an hour winds, which I know for you East Coasters is nothing.
5639403	5643705	But again, our infrastructure is not built for this kind of shit.
5644225	5658105	and it was wreaking a lot of havoc here too with all of the downed trees last year and that type of stuff so um climate change sucks um well I even commented on it myself that I thought it was not not far off
5662290	5664671	Anyway, let's move on.
5664731	5666812	Let's talk about F-Zero.
5667233	5674236	Jason mentioned this in the intro, and I will admit, Jason, I was not aware, and I love F-Zero, and I was not aware, or I forgot.
5674296	5679959	I think I was aware, but it just kind of like one of those, well, we'll never play it, that there was an F-Zero title in Japan.
5679979	5681300	It was F-Zero Climax.
5681320	5682020	Well, guess what?
5682481	5689965	We are going to get to play F-Zero Climax here, legally, as all things considered, through Nintendo Switch Online.
5691266	5693469	It is coming out this week on October 11th.
5693930	5699960	If you have Nintendo Switch Online and Expansion Pack, so you have to have the, you know, Super version of Nintendo Switch Online because...
5700319	5700799	F-Zero Climax
5722449	5725971	are getting another hurrah here in the States.
5726191	5727051	So very cool.
5727171	5727791	Love to see that.
5728091	5731052	So check that out on Nintendo Switch Online this week.
5732193	5739576	If Nintendo Switch Online is not your cup of tea, perhaps there is another game up your alley as we travel around and check out some world release dates.
5740096	5741156	Loki, what's coming out in the U.S.?
5742137	5742477	All right.
5742597	5743357	So in the U.S.

5878584	5880286	All right, traveling to Japan.
5880606	5884089	Not quite as busy of a week for whatever reason, but we do still have some titles coming out.
5884129	5884990	It's not completely empty.
5885650	5891215	On the Nintendo Switch this week in Japan, we have Sunsoft is Back, retro game selection.
5891295	5897160	But these are not, I think here in the States you might associate Sunsoft with like Blaster Master and Fester's Quest.
5897661	5898521	Not those games.
5898862	5901564	These games are, I believe they were all Japanese exclusives.
5902285	5903426	The Wing of Medulla.
5904226	5922314	Firework Throw at Kantaro's 53 Stations of the Tukaido yes that was the full name of the game is in that collection and Ripple Island those are the three games that make off the Sunsoft is Back collection and that is out on the Switch this week in Japan they actually have a limited edition of that coming out as well which I think just comes with like
5923254	5924115	Some extra crap.
5925035	5929518	If you love physical edition stuff, it just has some extra collectible crap.
5930438	5931379	Do you like crap?
5931459	5932039	Here you go.
5932300	5935181	Nothing that really changes otherwise with the games made up of.
5935742	5941745	And on the PlayStation 5 this week, of course, the Silent Hill 2 remake I think is getting a lot of attention.
5941785	5943086	That is coming out in Japan as well.
5943106	5944507	It looks like a worldwide release.
5945567	5951749	and otherwise we have Dragon Ball Sparking Zero also hitting Japan on the PlayStation 5 this week.
5952589	5965032	Metaphor ReFantasio is also out in Japan this week in a regular and of course a 35th anniversary edition limited edition because we love our limited editions in Japan.
5965272	5966293	But that's pretty much it.
5966593	5969834	Silent Hill 2 Remake obviously seems to be the tentpole this week.
5970674	5972054	So check that out or don't.
5972234	5972834	It's your money.
5973495	5974615	DarkSakura, how about Europe?

6020223	6030851	Transformers Galactic Trials also on October 11th Starship Troopers, Extermination Europa for PC and Switch and that is it
6032362	6040328	Alright, we have a few more stories for you, and then we'll see if any of you want to call in tonight in our green room over on our Discord server, vognetwork.com.
6040789	6043711	But we do have a couple stories to get to first, starting with Loki.
6044892	6056041	Yeah, so Epic Games has now filed a lawsuit against Samsung over their tech essentially discouraging the installation of third-party software, which is...
6057165	6057485	DarkSakura,
6082991	6111456	and apparently they have a way to disable the autoblocker that's laid out on Epic's site but you have to go through this whole process be somewhat tech savvy to be able to actually do that to your device to get this to install it's just a big old hassle right now they haven't really proven what kind of damages they're I guess seeking but they are right now trying to at least get that so that it allows them to easily install it
6115405	6132675	but I don't know they won against Google so maybe interesting this is only going to get messier but you know again this just goes back to Epic Epic wants Fortnite as a platform on every screen every screen every screen
6133996	6140441	Anyway, unfortunately some sad news to take us out tonight with our last scheduled story.
6140901	6144925	That has to do with a developer stepping down from Bloodstained 2.
6145905	6156434	Chutaro Aida, who is a veteran designer on Castlevania, was also working on Bloodstained Ritual of the Night, has stepped down and it's unfortunately due to a cancer diagnosis.
6157274	6172845	so a hearty fuck cancer from all of us here this was a decision that was announced on social media and even though he's been involved with coming up with ideas for the game and so on he's going to be going through treatment and Koji Igarashi who of course
6173385	6178308	You know him from being the long, long time producer of Castlevania series, him and his amazing cowboy hat.
6178889	6179629	The man in the hat.
6179729	6189035	Yep, moved on to Bloodstained, and he also reposted the message on his official Twitter account, talking about his own sadness and wishing a quick recovery.
6189956	6199602	If you want to translate that into English, the message said, up until now, the DS series, meaning Castlevania series, and Bloodstained have been produced primarily by director Shataro.
6200522	6229690	they can truly be called his works it is a great blow that he is stepping away from the project but we all do our best to make up for this we hope that he will recover soon so that we can work together again yeah that is the worst to hear about and I'm sorry to hear it but that's what you have to do step away from work so you can heal up and hopefully he will heal up fast alright with that you gotta do it if you're not yeah
6230029	6230530	Feeling great.
6230830	6230990	Yep.
6231832	6232112	All right.
6232232	6233975	That takes us to the listener roundtable.
6234135	6239183	So we invite your calls in the green room, but we also invite your emails here every week on the show.
6239203	6240364	I just don't know if we have any.
6240425	6244591	I think, unfortunately, we have another dry week over at participate at orange.com.
6247317	6247658	Nope.
6248478	6250980	Honestly, I forgot to open it.
6251981	6252322	That's fine.
6252362	6253803	I'm almost positive there's nothing there.
6253843	6261329	But while you double check, we need to come up with a way where people can text message us or something.
6262550	6269516	Because again, I don't use Twitter and I don't want to use Twitter and I don't want to encourage people and I don't think there's enough people on any of the alternatives yet.
6269876	6273497	For me to say, oh, send us a message on Mastodon or Blue Sky or anything like that.
6273957	6278698	So I am open to ideas, especially from the podcast crowd.
6278778	6283500	Like if you listen to us throughout the week, only on the podcast, you're not here live Sunday night.
6284100	6286781	I'm very, or on YouTube or wherever it is you find this show.
6286821	6287561	I'm very curious.
6288241	6293082	What would, what's an easy way, what would be an easy way for you to say, say hey to us?
6293642	6295923	Because right now I'm thinking like a text message thing would be cool.
6296710	6301293	Yeah, Spotify I think has commenting on like podcasts too.
6301313	6301834	It does.
6302194	6306437	I will admit I'm not very good at checking it because I don't think it emails us.
6307558	6310820	And also I also realize, you know, not everybody's on Spotify.
6310900	6311981	Yeah, that's true.
6312121	6314563	I have seen a YouTube comment or two come in.
6315384	6318367	Um, so I guess people are starting to find us there.
6318507	6322451	And that's something that when Google Podcasts went away, it was like, oh, yeah, YouTube.
6322652	6323092	Okay, thank you.
6323372	6325275	YouTube has a whole baked in thing over there.
6325335	6326596	So we're happy to be there on YouTube.
6326936	6331862	But then iTunes, iTunes also has the review thing.
6332182	6334024	But that's, that's a little different from commenting.
6334965	6340151	Um, you know, if you just want to send us a note saying, hey, I've been playing this game or hey, you guys should check this out or whatever.
6340832	6344275	Um, I'm really open to how we can encourage more of that.
6344896	6346537	Bobby Blackwell says WhatsApp.
6346638	6348399	Don't you have to, isn't that kind of like tied?
6348980	6350221	I, I'm gonna, I'm gonna be honest.
6351022	6352704	I associate WhatsApp with scams.
6352925	6361536	And I know that people use it to chat with family overseas and stuff, but I associate WhatsApp with scams.
6361757	6364200	And I know not a lot of people will use it because it's Facebook owned.
6364781	6368185	And I feel like, again, that's a thing where...
6369409	6373130	Some people use WhatsApp, some people use Telegram, some people use Signal.
6373570	6380932	And if I were to say, oh, we're taking messages on Telegram, well, then everybody who uses WhatsApp and Signal would be like, well, fuck me, right?
6380972	6382012	Because I'm on the wrong app.
6385073	6385773	Yeah, I don't know.
6386893	6388934	Good question, though, about threads.
6389174	6390414	I didn't think of that one, but...
6392322	6393222	Remember to post there.
6394563	6395643	I feel like Threads has it.
6396123	6397523	I guess more people are on Threads.
6397923	6399944	Fifth Dream says, let's go back to ICQ.
6400024	6400584	Truly.
6400664	6403785	I think ICQ finally is gone, though.
6404645	6406065	I don't think ICQ is around anymore.
6406085	6408186	I think they finally, finally went away.
6409646	6413307	Folks can text a Google voice number and you can get emails.
6413407	6414607	Maybe that's what we have to do.
6414907	6415247	I don't know.
6415788	6416848	I'll have to look into that.
6417408	6417808	We'll see.
6417888	6418688	Maybe in the future.
6420669	6421089	Alright.
6423703	6429688	Okay, that is going to do it for, well, let me go over to last minute stories from Loki.
6429748	6430408	Do you have anything else?
6430448	6431929	You got a good one a minute ago.
6432249	6433570	Yeah, just not much.
6434191	6442617	Essentially that Bloober team has teased that they could be working on more Konami projects after Silent Hill 2 because Konami is happy with the work the team has done.
6443518	6445139	And the reception that Silent Hill 2 is getting.
6445179	6447541	It better be Silent Hill 3!
6447581	6447821	Maybe.
6448502	6449302	We'll know.
6449462	6450263	Soon enough.
6450904	6451404	We'll find out.
6452905	6454206	Whatever happened to Silent Hill F?
6454847	6457789	The original one, the Konami, or I'm assuming Konami Contractor.
6457829	6458650	Didn't that already come out?
6459991	6462393	No, that's the TV show one came out.
6462554	6468038	Remember the one that showed like the, it was like the ancient Japan looking thing or the, like that?
6468078	6469460	Yeah, I remember that one.
6469500	6471001	Yeah, that was the new Silent Hill game.
6472547	6487935	I don't know it's F for fuck no Orange Rite says it is still upcoming if I recall correctly I don't think you're wrong we just haven't heard anything on it in a long time but yeah different company though yeah
6490069	6491912	FifthDream suggests IRC.
6492613	6495318	We could take comments on IRC the way we used to.
6495698	6502129	And was asking if the All Games channel was still around because, you know, for a while we were... No, we never did merge with that chat.
6502249	6503912	Our chats were always separate, weren't they?
6505404	6506905	We never did merge with that chat.
6507546	6510028	The radio shows did, but the chats never did.
6510628	6511749	I don't know why that was.
6512690	6515852	Now that all these years later, I'm not sure why that was, but don't ask me.
6516072	6517093	It made sense at the time.
6517133	6518134	It doesn't make sense now.
6518194	6518594	Don't ask.
6520456	6525000	But no, well, All Games Radio went to heaven a few years ago, I believe.
6525120	6529083	So I don't think, well, maybe the IRC channel is still kicking.
6530686	6531986	Is Bobby still lurking there?
6532206	6534107	Bobby's the one that would still be lurking on IRS.
6534187	6537288	Actually, no, I think he finally left that channel some time ago.
6538188	6538788	Tigerclaw.
6539548	6540468	Where's Tigerclaw at?
6541269	6545150	Oh, Tigerclaw's probably... Tigerclaw, I hope he's not in the way of the hurricane.
6547930	6549791	Yeah, OrangeRite says RIP co-host.
6549911	6550571	They had promise.
6552755	6557617	Bobby says I had to shut off my BSD machine and that logged me out of all my IRC channels.
6558077	6561039	Is anyone still in Orange Lounge on Game Surge?
6563340	6564860	No, I'm not.
6564880	6567541	I bet somebody's got to be holding down the fort there.
6568082	6568522	Hello.
6568942	6570823	Oh, shout out to Game Surge IRC.
6574504	6574905	All right.
6574965	6575225	All right.
6575465	6575685	Anyway.
6577011	6578212	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6595531	6623014	uh let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts uh DarkSakura oh wait first uh thank you as always for listening to Orange Launch Radio if you enjoyed what you heard here tonight tell a friend or two about the show help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice but we need more voices to put out on air so uh tell a friend or two or five we appreciate it a nice five-star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, uh YouTube all that goes a very long way thank you so much um all right uh DarkSakura your final thought tonight
6624385	6630210	I'm not streaming tonight because my eye is still threatening to swell itself shut.
6630230	6633012	I just took a second round of Benadryl.
6633673	6638017	But hopefully the one I have chosen will be acceptable.
6638737	6639017	Alright.
6640298	6640859	We'll feel better.
6642100	6643261	Loki, your final thought tonight?
6644522	6648465	My final thought is hopefully this week we'll get a new episode out.
6648585	6650807	I've been working on stuff for a very long time.
6650827	6652829	It's just still being worked on.
6653814	6654495	All right, you can do it.
6655375	6661320	And my final thought is later tonight, I'm trying to keep a Monday, Wednesday, Friday thing up for my retro videos.
6661340	6664263	So I'm going to do some recordings in advance tonight off stream.
6664883	6668927	And although I guess I could have done it on if I knew you weren't going to be streaming Dark Sakura.
6669427	6670528	Oh, well, it doesn't matter now.
6670788	6671969	I didn't know I wasn't going to be.
6672109	6672430	I know.
6672550	6672830	I know.
6672950	6674411	I thought I would feel better by tonight.
6674651	6678515	But apparently dust mites have other decisions for my skin.
6678835	6680276	That's all right, because I have some errands to run.
6680356	6681998	It still looks pretty bad, doesn't it?
6682538	6687540	Yeah, you sent me some pictures and I was like, oh gosh, I'm sorry to hear it.
6687880	6688400	That's no fun.
6689080	6693601	Alright, well that's going to do it for another episode here at Orange Lounge Radio.
6695582	6696782	Yeah, that's it.
6697683	6698203	Bye everybody.
6698263	6698683	Have a good night.
