00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:14,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Former PlayStation executive Sean Layden says that the console power arms race has plateaued.

2
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:20,595
[SPEAKER_06]: As quoted by Video Games Chronicle, Sean states, If you're playing your game and sunlight is coming through your window onto your TV, you're not seeing any ray tracing.

3
00:00:20,735 --> 00:00:21,956
[SPEAKER_06]: It has to be super optimal.

4
00:00:22,116 --> 00:00:24,777
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to have an 8K monitor in a dark room to see these things.

5
00:00:25,077 --> 00:00:27,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Are details you can't see worth the higher power requirements?

6
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:29,840
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the Prognostication Intro.

7
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, James Somerson, Loki, to tell you more about what he said in the rest of the week's gaming news.

8
00:00:34,863 --> 00:00:36,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice...

9
00:00:39,403 --> 00:00:41,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hello, my friends out there on the internet.

10
00:00:41,925 --> 00:00:46,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

11
00:00:47,869 --> 00:00:52,432
[SPEAKER_02]: We are here to talk about video games, video gaming, gamer lifestyle, all that good stuff.

12
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:58,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Myself, Rob Roberts, here with you as always, and my co-host, the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

13
00:00:59,277 --> 00:00:59,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey.

14
00:00:59,877 --> 00:01:00,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, hello.

15
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:00,898
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?

16
00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:29,013

17
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:30,193
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

18
00:01:30,234 --> 00:01:32,096
[SPEAKER_02]: It is that time of year for costumes.

19
00:01:32,296 --> 00:01:32,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it.

20
00:01:32,897 --> 00:01:34,058
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you have a rant in you.

21
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:36,961
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get to it, but I don't want to make Techmaster Loki wait.

22
00:01:36,981 --> 00:01:37,822
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to say hi, Loki.

23
00:01:37,862 --> 00:01:38,142
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?

24
00:01:38,953 --> 00:01:39,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, pretty good.

25
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:51,219
[SPEAKER_02]: I am so curious what this is playing behind you as we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.

26
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:56,502
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've got some very... Is this like MineCon or something that's playing behind you?

27
00:01:56,702 --> 00:01:57,322
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.

28
00:01:57,422 --> 00:02:03,806
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the new... I don't even know if it's open yet, but this is the Minecraft experience.

29
00:02:03,886 --> 00:02:05,446
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a villager rescue.

30
00:02:05,506 --> 00:02:06,367
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a live...

31
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:34,401
[SPEAKER_02]: experience that they put together in Dallas, Texas where you go and you play in these physical rooms that are projected with stuff and you interact with everything on the walls I don't want to talk too much about people who aren't here but a streamer I watch I'm almost positive was saying something about going on the road soon to be behind the scenes type of work at that event so that's kind of funny I forgot that was a thing until now you're saying I'm like oh it actually looks really neat though

32
00:02:35,168 --> 00:03:03,612
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah it looks pretty cool apparently the whole game is like built in Unreal Engine and stuff and you know based off of like some of the stuff I've watched you know it looks pretty involved so it'd be fun apparently it's going on the road at some point but right now it's in Dallas I ain't flying out there for that but it's still cool you drive to SF for it San Francisco right or maybe even LA maybe I would go to that in San Francisco

33
00:03:03,772 --> 00:03:04,252
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks better.

34
00:03:04,272 --> 00:03:04,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.

35
00:03:04,693 --> 00:03:05,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I would go to that in San Francisco too.

36
00:03:06,594 --> 00:03:08,015
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even the Minecraft fan, Loki.

37
00:03:08,295 --> 00:03:19,942
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, DarkSakura, you and I just need to shove Loki in a burlap sack and take him to San Francisco for like an unbirthday present or something if this thing shows up in San Francisco because I'm like, I actually want to go.

38
00:03:20,022 --> 00:03:20,942
[SPEAKER_02]: This looks kind of fun.

39
00:03:21,002 --> 00:03:23,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob, are you suggesting that we have a team building?

40
00:03:23,784 --> 00:03:25,105
[SPEAKER_01]: A team building event?

41
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,166
[SPEAKER_01]: A team building event.

42
00:03:26,886 --> 00:03:49,772
[SPEAKER_05]: so that'd be a lot more fun than what like my work wants to do for team building my work for team building they're like hey you know how you like work your remote what if we just didn't do that for three days three days that's right three days um and and for our team building we're just gonna have meetings and we're gonna work in the office and uh that's it fun it's like

43
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,621
[SPEAKER_05]: You just don't get it, do you?

44
00:03:53,541 --> 00:04:01,526
[SPEAKER_05]: When people voted whether they wanted to work in the office or not, there was one person who was like, I miss everybody, I want to go in the office, and that person quit.

45
00:04:02,907 --> 00:04:04,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody wants to work in the office.

46
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:11,532
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only us that are local to the main office that are so lucky to participate in this.

47
00:04:11,612 --> 00:04:16,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody else gets a pass because they're actually further out remote.

48
00:04:17,436 --> 00:04:19,317
[SPEAKER_01]: My work just went to a hybrid thing.

49
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:26,582
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to refrain from comment on this because there's an element of this that touches my job and I don't like to cross the stream, so to speak.

50
00:04:26,622 --> 00:04:36,546
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will say as far as team building goes, I have gotten to in the past do an escape room with my team members.

51
00:04:36,626 --> 00:04:37,886
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's actually a lot of fun.

52
00:04:37,926 --> 00:04:41,688
[SPEAKER_02]: But the funny thing is my like our ultra competitive sides all come out.

53
00:04:42,769 --> 00:04:49,515
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really funny because I learned that I'm not the only hyper-competitive person in my workplace.

54
00:04:49,715 --> 00:04:51,236
[SPEAKER_02]: There are plenty of other people.

55
00:04:51,336 --> 00:04:58,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I worry if anybody ever suggests we do Survivor or something really cutthroat for a team-building event.

56
00:04:58,283 --> 00:05:01,545
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm going to sit this one out because this is going to be dangerous.

57
00:05:01,646 --> 00:05:05,029
[SPEAKER_02]: I will be fired if we do this as a team-building event.

58
00:05:05,809 --> 00:05:07,871
[SPEAKER_01]: And see, I like cooperative stuff.

59
00:05:08,132 --> 00:05:09,453
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like competitive stuff.

60
00:05:09,493 --> 00:05:10,394
[SPEAKER_01]: I like cooperative stuff.

61
00:05:10,414 --> 00:05:12,436
[SPEAKER_02]: And the escape room is cooperative, to be fair.

62
00:05:12,456 --> 00:05:14,598
[SPEAKER_02]: The only hyper-competitiveness is against the puzzle.

63
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:15,699
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's fine.

64
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:16,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

65
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:17,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

66
00:05:18,482 --> 00:05:19,183
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

67
00:05:37,364 --> 00:05:38,505
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of missed it.

68
00:05:38,785 --> 00:05:43,669
[SPEAKER_02]: We got rid of the FUs of the Week some time ago because gaming culture is unfortunately angry enough.

69
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:51,515
[SPEAKER_02]: But once in a while, once in a while, there's something that necessitates a special revival of the FUs of the Week segment.

70
00:05:51,535 --> 00:05:55,258
[SPEAKER_02]: So, DarkSakura, by all means, do you have an FU of the Week you'd like to give out?

71
00:05:56,354 --> 00:05:56,714
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.

72
00:05:57,715 --> 00:06:03,337
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is to my experience on Dead by Daylight as of late.

73
00:06:03,437 --> 00:06:08,499
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not specifically saying that it's for behavior or G-Force or whatever.

74
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:18,243
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying it's toward my experience because I'm sure that there are things that are out of people's hands, but there's been just things that have been distasteful to me.

75
00:06:18,563 --> 00:06:21,744
[SPEAKER_01]: I think distasteful is a good way to phrase it, right?

76
00:06:21,845 --> 00:06:24,766
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I need more to drink also before I go on this, but anyway.

77
00:06:25,846 --> 00:06:33,874
[SPEAKER_01]: So, after the update that happened on last Tuesday, that's the 8th, isn't it?

78
00:06:36,056 --> 00:06:45,644
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I load into a match with my friends, so I will henceforth be referring to this as a SWIFT or survive with friends.

79
00:06:48,206 --> 00:06:52,809
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as we get past loading perks, my game freezes and boots me out.

80
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:56,011
[SPEAKER_01]: Granted, I play on the GeForce experience.

81
00:06:56,051 --> 00:07:00,333
[SPEAKER_01]: I pay for the highest tier and the best of all of the stuff, so I get a great experience.

82
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:06,437
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using Steam in GeForce to play Dead by Daylight.

83
00:07:06,957 --> 00:07:09,018
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, there's the thing.

84
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:13,681
[SPEAKER_01]: I play on a Mac Studio 64-bit M2 Ultra.

85
00:07:14,022 --> 00:07:16,083
[SPEAKER_01]: So my machine is no slouch.

86
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:19,405
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we're going to be now going back to the situation.

87
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:20,686
[SPEAKER_01]: So this has been happening.

88
00:07:21,367 --> 00:07:26,410
[SPEAKER_01]: And me, being a tech person, I have gone through so many different ways.

89
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I've tried it with...

90
00:07:28,891 --> 00:07:34,635
[SPEAKER_01]: SoloQ, I've tried Killer, I've tried Custom Matches, I've done this and that.

91
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:37,757
[SPEAKER_01]: I can play Killer, sometimes it still boots me out.

92
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:45,242
[SPEAKER_01]: I could not do SoloQ at all for a while, and then I was able to do SoloQ for a little bit.

93
00:07:45,342 --> 00:07:47,684
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it still is problematic.

94
00:07:49,045 --> 00:07:52,487
[SPEAKER_01]: I have gone through and checked that the appropriate...

95
00:07:54,328 --> 00:07:57,790
[SPEAKER_01]: ports necessary for GeForce are open, and they are.

96
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,631
[SPEAKER_01]: I have gone through all of my network utilities.

97
00:08:00,751 --> 00:08:02,271
[SPEAKER_01]: I have changed nothing.

98
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:08,934
[SPEAKER_01]: My connection with GeForce is probably double what their recommended settings are.

99
00:08:09,014 --> 00:08:11,035
[SPEAKER_01]: I have come out exceptional in all things.

100
00:08:11,895 --> 00:08:16,558
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started off with behavior and I said, this is what's going on.

101
00:08:16,698 --> 00:08:17,879
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot give you logs.

102
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:19,280
[SPEAKER_01]: I play through this method.

103
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,802
[SPEAKER_01]: I have VODs of this happening.

104
00:08:21,842 --> 00:08:22,702
[SPEAKER_01]: I have screenshots.

105
00:08:22,742 --> 00:08:25,784
[SPEAKER_01]: I have timestamps because again, I'm a tech.

106
00:08:26,224 --> 00:08:26,485
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

107
00:08:27,565 --> 00:08:50,286
[SPEAKER_01]: and and so I went through all the things like okay well we consider this this closed you go talk to GeForce now and I was like and first of all I also made sure no VPNs no nothing and I I also want to take a step aside that if anyone tries to give me tech support please bear with me if I get irritated at it because it's what I do I've done everything trust me

108
00:08:51,107 --> 00:08:51,988
[SPEAKER_01]: I know my computer.

109
00:08:52,168 --> 00:08:54,849
[SPEAKER_01]: And PC Advice as a little bearing for a Mac.

110
00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:57,491
[SPEAKER_02]: So to be clear, you did turn it off and then on again.

111
00:08:58,431 --> 00:08:58,791
Rob.

112
00:09:00,412 --> 00:09:00,932
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to.

113
00:09:01,193 --> 00:09:01,653
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to.

114
00:09:01,773 --> 00:09:02,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.

115
00:09:03,174 --> 00:09:03,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Several times.

116
00:09:03,934 --> 00:09:04,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

117
00:09:04,414 --> 00:09:05,315
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

118
00:09:05,935 --> 00:09:06,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

119
00:09:06,355 --> 00:09:13,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I even went so far as to go into my activity monitor and disable all of the background elements related to GeForce and then completely reboot it in system.

120
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,881
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.

121
00:09:17,061 --> 00:09:17,822
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, anyway, anyway.

122
00:09:18,602 --> 00:09:18,882
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

123
00:09:20,632 --> 00:09:24,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Things started to work for a little bit and then it just went right back to it again.

124
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:35,121
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got another error this time for their anti-cheat that they use.

125
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:36,842
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it called again that they use?

126
00:09:36,902 --> 00:09:37,563
[SPEAKER_01]: Easy anti-cheat?

127
00:09:38,467 --> 00:09:45,732
[SPEAKER_01]: I got an error this time that popped up that said that it detected something and that it crashed because of that.

128
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,774
[SPEAKER_01]: I saved that screenshot.

129
00:09:50,036 --> 00:09:55,219
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're like, I'm sorry the issue came back while you're playing.

130
00:09:55,319 --> 00:09:59,022
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, I'll ask you to kindly reach out to GeForce, blah, blah, blah.

131
00:09:59,082 --> 00:10:00,543
[SPEAKER_01]: We consider this closed, blah, blah, blah.

132
00:10:00,603 --> 00:10:00,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

133
00:10:01,084 --> 00:10:01,404
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said...

134
00:10:01,624 --> 00:10:03,405
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't consider this solved.

135
00:10:03,505 --> 00:10:07,066
[SPEAKER_01]: All of my other games connected perfectly to GeForce on my Steam accounts.

136
00:10:07,486 --> 00:10:09,607
[SPEAKER_01]: The issue has been isolated to Dead by Daylight only.

137
00:10:09,727 --> 00:10:11,488
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to go into where I work.

138
00:10:12,648 --> 00:10:14,029
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand the back end quite a bit.

139
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:24,733
[SPEAKER_01]: What I don't understand is if all other multiplayer experiences work in other games using both Steam and GeForce, why would Dead by Daylight be the outlier and then specifically in Swift Matches?

140
00:10:25,473 --> 00:10:27,934
[SPEAKER_01]: Secondly, this came about with the update from 10.8.24.

141
00:10:28,034 --> 00:10:30,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Third, GeForce reported no connection issues.

142
00:10:31,296 --> 00:10:34,138
[SPEAKER_01]: Fourth, the last error I received was specific to easy anti-cheat.

143
00:10:34,418 --> 00:10:36,279
[SPEAKER_01]: I have screenshots and timestamps if it helps.

144
00:10:36,619 --> 00:10:37,980
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like my case to be escalated.

145
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:45,304
[SPEAKER_01]: I did, however, go through GeForce as well and let them know all of the things.

146
00:10:45,884 --> 00:10:51,707
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, I did get a reply from Behavior that says, we'll be investigating this to the best of our abilities.

147
00:10:51,807 --> 00:10:54,729
[SPEAKER_01]: We are going to be, you know, essentially, they're escalating the case.

148
00:10:55,109 --> 00:10:56,289
[SPEAKER_01]: We're paying attention to you.

149
00:10:56,349 --> 00:10:56,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Congrats.

150
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,210
[SPEAKER_01]: GeForce is doing the same thing.

151
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:04,652
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, Ranma, I know you do.

152
00:11:04,752 --> 00:11:05,872
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew you would feel it.

153
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:06,692
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel it.

154
00:11:07,032 --> 00:11:10,433
[SPEAKER_01]: I work on the side that escalates this shit.

155
00:11:11,353 --> 00:11:12,334
[SPEAKER_01]: I gather the logs.

156
00:11:12,514 --> 00:11:13,294
[SPEAKER_01]: I do the stuff.

157
00:11:13,334 --> 00:11:17,555
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I need to do all this shit to try to make their jobs as easy as I could.

158
00:11:20,036 --> 00:11:22,776
[SPEAKER_01]: I respect what my fellow techs do.

159
00:11:23,257 --> 00:11:23,897
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also

160
00:11:25,037 --> 00:11:38,470
[SPEAKER_01]: I do understand that sometimes it's easy to say, oh, well, it can't be this, it has to be this, when you do not put aside any aspect of it just in case.

161
00:11:40,052 --> 00:11:41,473
[SPEAKER_02]: The answer to this isn't in my book.

162
00:11:43,348 --> 00:11:43,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

163
00:11:44,008 --> 00:12:03,640
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and for me, like, what I'll even do is, like, even if I know something, you know, in my heart, in my gut, just isn't necessarily the right thing, I will still do the escalation to check with the people who know the coding better than I do to check that for me and be a thousand percent positive that I am not just dismissing this.

164
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of hand, you know?

165
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:08,282
[SPEAKER_02]: It also seems obvious to me.

166
00:12:08,822 --> 00:12:12,584
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been playing, streaming Dead by Daylight without issue all this time.

167
00:12:12,964 --> 00:12:15,025
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't change anything on your end.

168
00:12:15,045 --> 00:12:16,265
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the update.

169
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:17,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the update.

170
00:12:17,246 --> 00:12:20,968
[SPEAKER_02]: A patch goes out by Dead by Daylight, and then all of a sudden it's broken.

171
00:12:21,288 --> 00:12:25,730
[SPEAKER_02]: A patch, by the way, which made major changes to surviving, right?

172
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:30,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it has the whole, the mores that happen at the end automatically now and all this stuff, right?

173
00:12:30,392 --> 00:12:32,773
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's very clearly changes happening.

174
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:38,379
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was getting booted out of the occasional killer match on top of it.

175
00:12:40,221 --> 00:12:42,504
[SPEAKER_01]: I could do a kill your friends match.

176
00:12:42,864 --> 00:12:46,428
[SPEAKER_01]: I could not be a survivor in a custom match with my friends.

177
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:50,613
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it seems pretty obvious to me that the problem is this patch.

178
00:12:52,364 --> 00:13:04,626
[SPEAKER_01]: and specifically the way it's working with uh with uh specific networking like when you've got multiple people going into one instead of just a mass queue right so um

179
00:13:06,635 --> 00:13:08,095
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm following the channels.

180
00:13:08,235 --> 00:13:09,376
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing all the things.

181
00:13:09,696 --> 00:13:14,177
[SPEAKER_01]: I can play Dead by Daylight on stream with some difficulty.

182
00:13:16,157 --> 00:13:17,377
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends have been great.

183
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:20,978
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been hanging out in my chat while I play killer matches and everything.

184
00:13:21,038 --> 00:13:22,858
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've had fun doing Kill Your Friends.

185
00:13:23,158 --> 00:13:29,539
[SPEAKER_01]: I can certainly do a few things to gather other content for other things.

186
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:32,100
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is very frustrating.

187
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:48,786
[SPEAKER_01]: and I mean and I flat out was like I hate to be that person but I've spent a lot of money on this game okay I spent a lot of money on the services I have been pretty hardcore loyal since I started you know and to have this happen you know

188
00:13:49,466 --> 00:13:53,349
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been, you know, I've been pretty, pretty upfront too.

189
00:13:53,369 --> 00:14:03,076
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I will be discussing this in, in, you know, on my podcast, on my, on my forums, on my social media, all of it.

190
00:14:03,136 --> 00:14:16,566
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be public about this because, you know, I'm not going to be like a, you know, a stupid Karen about it, but I am going to be a concerned person that wants to get my, what I'm paying for, you know, and keep...

191
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:25,116
[SPEAKER_02]: The question I have is that you can't be the only person on planet Earth using GeForce Now to play Dead by Daylight or that wouldn't be in there.

192
00:14:26,257 --> 00:14:29,161
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm kind of curious, where are the other people maybe having issues?

193
00:14:29,381 --> 00:14:31,464
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a few reports here and there.

194
00:14:31,624 --> 00:14:32,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, because I'm like...

195
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:37,788
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not really a major market.

196
00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:41,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't GeForce now something that has a free tier?

197
00:14:41,671 --> 00:14:43,152
[SPEAKER_02]: I still don't remember I've used it in the past.

198
00:14:43,172 --> 00:14:43,492
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.

199
00:14:43,512 --> 00:14:45,453
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like an hour that you get to play.

200
00:14:45,554 --> 00:14:47,495
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ridiculous and not very good.

201
00:14:47,655 --> 00:14:50,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if I should try to log in and see if Dead by Daylight works.

202
00:14:50,877 --> 00:14:52,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Or file a ticket and help.

203
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:54,820
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll file a ticket too.

204
00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:00,183
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is that you would need to do a Swift match to test it specifically the way that I'm doing it.

205
00:15:01,204 --> 00:15:02,225
[SPEAKER_01]: And you are on a PC.

206
00:15:03,145 --> 00:15:03,325
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

207
00:15:03,626 --> 00:15:03,986
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

208
00:15:04,847 --> 00:15:05,427
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on a Mac.

209
00:15:06,468 --> 00:15:08,950
[SPEAKER_02]: But on top of that, like, I have... I have a Mac.

210
00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:12,753
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but your Mac won't run it very well.

211
00:15:13,754 --> 00:15:15,295
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you that right now.

212
00:15:15,495 --> 00:15:16,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though it's cloud?

213
00:15:16,356 --> 00:15:17,376
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought because it was cloud.

214
00:15:17,857 --> 00:15:18,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well.

215
00:15:18,832 --> 00:15:24,693
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, because you still have to have the RAM allocation to run other stuff.

216
00:15:24,993 --> 00:15:25,894
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

217
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,594
[SPEAKER_01]: But at any rate, well, and add another thing on there.

218
00:15:28,634 --> 00:15:33,796
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I noticed that my Wi-Fi was on and I normally play hardwired.

219
00:15:33,836 --> 00:15:36,056
[SPEAKER_01]: So I switched my Wi-Fi off and switched to hardwire.

220
00:15:36,796 --> 00:15:38,657
[SPEAKER_01]: And oh, yay, a match worked.

221
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:42,238
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I played on stream and no, it didn't.

222
00:15:42,998 --> 00:15:45,038
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, the fuck, man.

223
00:15:45,798 --> 00:15:46,679
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.

224
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:52,319
[SPEAKER_01]: PodCulture, you could probably get away with it.

225
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:53,820
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on your RAM.

226
00:15:53,860 --> 00:16:00,505
[SPEAKER_01]: Your processor isn't going to be as... If you've got 16 or more, you should be able to test it just fine.

227
00:16:01,866 --> 00:16:07,669
[SPEAKER_01]: I was playing on an M1 Mac before, and now Dan has that Mac, and I'm playing on an M2 Mac.

228
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,831
[SPEAKER_01]: It's M2 Ultra, M2 Pro.

229
00:16:09,871 --> 00:16:10,632
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to look again.

230
00:16:11,032 --> 00:16:14,495
[SPEAKER_01]: But my Mac Studio is more than capable of it.

231
00:16:15,335 --> 00:16:20,839
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would also like to throw in that there is that pop-up that happened with the easy anti-cheat.

232
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,842
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saving every screenshot and every piece of documentation.

233
00:16:24,302 --> 00:16:33,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because, you know, I've learned in my line of business that this is what you need to do when you're dealing with shit like this.

234
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:35,511
[SPEAKER_02]: So it sounds like the anti-cheat might also be

235
00:16:35,851 --> 00:16:36,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of the problem.

236
00:16:36,774 --> 00:16:39,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Like somehow the way the patch interfaces the anti-cheat.

237
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:41,145
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?

238
00:16:41,225 --> 00:16:43,812
[SPEAKER_01]: If it wasn't for their anti-cheat, I could play with whiskey.

239
00:16:45,987 --> 00:17:12,960
[SPEAKER_01]: which I've gone over what Whiskey is before for anyone who knows Linux and Mac OS and Unix systems Wine is a Windows sort of emulator for applications and this uses a combination of the game porting kit built into Mac OS and Wine to play games I played, well I mean now since it's out of beta

240
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:20,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they, uh, what's the word I was gonna say?

241
00:17:20,815 --> 00:17:22,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I can talk about it.

242
00:17:22,496 --> 00:17:25,299
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I could run Project T, no problem.

243
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,422
[SPEAKER_01]: I can play What the Fog, no problem.

244
00:17:27,962 --> 00:17:30,045
[SPEAKER_01]: I can play Hooked on You, no problem.

245
00:17:31,086 --> 00:17:35,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well, yeah, it is an emulator, exactly, Bobby.

246
00:17:36,411 --> 00:17:38,113
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, um...

247
00:17:40,254 --> 00:18:09,311
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say almost more like a virtual environment simulator, emulator, blah blah blah and so I also want to point out and this is a rewind back they did ask the question can you simulate this can you play on another device and I was like I have no other device in which to play this I do not own a PC that is functional right now I don't play on console what's the point

248
00:18:10,206 --> 00:18:12,267
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my working copy of the game.

249
00:18:12,627 --> 00:18:14,307
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to be able to play it on anything else.

250
00:18:15,408 --> 00:18:18,389
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was flat out up front.

251
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:25,851
[SPEAKER_01]: Now maybe it might be worth it for me to get a PS4 version or something cheap and test it out.

252
00:18:25,931 --> 00:18:26,391
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

253
00:18:26,411 --> 00:18:28,372
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a no, you shouldn't have to.

254
00:18:29,494 --> 00:18:31,196
[SPEAKER_01]: I shouldn't have to pay anything to do that.

255
00:18:31,656 --> 00:18:33,698
[SPEAKER_02]: It reminds me of when my Final Fantasy was broken.

256
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:36,821
[SPEAKER_02]: It had the sound issues and I did end up having to go buy it.

257
00:18:36,841 --> 00:18:47,052
[SPEAKER_02]: It was right when Endwalker came out and I knew it was related to that and I had to end up buying the PS4 version of the game just so I could finish the freaking story before all the spoilers hit the internet and that was really annoying.

258
00:18:48,007 --> 00:18:50,369
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure I can find the PS4 version.

259
00:18:50,449 --> 00:18:54,732
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think now that they have the cross-play enabled... Yeah, you'll have everything.

260
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:55,352
[SPEAKER_02]: You will.

261
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:57,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can bring all my stuff back.

262
00:18:57,294 --> 00:18:59,455
[SPEAKER_01]: But I hate playing Dead by Daylight with a controller.

263
00:18:59,836 --> 00:19:01,837
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I get it.

264
00:19:01,997 --> 00:19:03,518
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a keyboard mouse person.

265
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:05,120
[SPEAKER_01]: I know how I play.

266
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,142
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I can actually look behind me when I run.

267
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,100
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?

268
00:19:10,221 --> 00:19:12,521
[SPEAKER_01]: But still.

269
00:19:13,182 --> 00:19:15,603
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I've been dealing with with Dead by Daylight.

270
00:19:15,643 --> 00:19:23,465
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why my streams have been, for anyone who is watching, have been named what they are.

271
00:19:23,485 --> 00:19:24,986
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm playing a lot more Palia lately.

272
00:19:27,527 --> 00:19:32,149
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's frustrating for me because...

273
00:19:33,249 --> 00:19:54,034
[SPEAKER_01]: I see some of the same, and this is now going into a little bit more about being tech support and working in tech support and having that knowledge is that we kind of do have a tendency to dismiss the layperson or to assume that anyone who is messaging us is a layperson, especially in games, I've noticed.

274
00:19:55,034 --> 00:19:57,155
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the best thing...

275
00:19:58,115 --> 00:20:08,813
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is now why like here out usually when I do have to open a ticket or call in for something I specify I work in tech and this is where I work

276
00:20:09,989 --> 00:20:15,694
[SPEAKER_01]: And typically when they find out where I work, they're like, oh shit, okay, we know you know what you're doing, right?

277
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:20,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's also, I feel very Comcast when I used to call them because the internet was down.

278
00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:22,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I've turned it off and on again.

279
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:25,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I've done, like, it's the same thing.

280
00:20:25,904 --> 00:20:28,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, all I have to do is tell them where I work and they escalate me.

281
00:20:29,107 --> 00:20:31,890
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have any more, so.

282
00:20:33,908 --> 00:20:38,550
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still with them, but we got a great... We're on Gigabit here.

283
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:50,334
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, so the big thing is that it's all going to be the channels you take.

284
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:56,996
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to know, when you are on the consumer side, you have to understand that...

285
00:20:59,142 --> 00:21:06,724
[SPEAKER_01]: Elimination, narrowing it down to the right item, will point you in the direction of the channel that you need to go to.

286
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:09,225
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I did do both channels.

287
00:21:09,385 --> 00:21:12,786
[SPEAKER_01]: It could very well be related to both items working in tandem.

288
00:21:12,906 --> 00:21:19,568
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I accepted to contact GeForce as well as continue my work with Behavior Tech Support.

289
00:21:20,308 --> 00:21:27,530
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also sent them like five different misspellings and grammatical corrections to make in Dead by Daylight stuff.

290
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:28,030
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

291
00:21:29,396 --> 00:21:35,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, some of the cosmetic descriptions are just like completely poorly written.

292
00:21:36,197 --> 00:21:37,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Like bad grammar, bad spelling, all of that.

293
00:21:38,078 --> 00:21:39,878
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't put out a... Yeah.

294
00:21:40,378 --> 00:21:40,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

295
00:21:40,638 --> 00:21:40,938
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

296
00:21:42,739 --> 00:21:44,239
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's what I'm dealing with right now.

297
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:48,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, sorry to hear it, but that is kind of interesting.

298
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:56,241
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think to kind of the point you made at the end there, I think is worth kind of revisiting and kind of underscoring a little bit.

299
00:21:56,301 --> 00:21:58,402
[SPEAKER_02]: That sometimes we kind of write off

300
00:21:58,962 --> 00:22:06,508
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of these concerns pretty quickly, especially in the gaming space, so that we make assumptions that the person on the other end of the line doesn't know what they're talking about, type of thing.

301
00:22:06,528 --> 00:22:07,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, there often is an assumption there.

302
00:22:08,649 --> 00:22:10,631
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're right, that happens a lot in the gaming space, too.

303
00:22:10,811 --> 00:22:16,595
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think it's, I think it's just, I don't know if there's, like, something we sit here and say, we gotta do it, but we gotta do it.

304
00:22:16,655 --> 00:22:19,657
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like, knowing is half the battle, as G.I.

305
00:22:19,697 --> 00:22:20,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Joe said.

306
00:22:20,518 --> 00:22:21,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you know, and knowing is half the battle.

307
00:22:21,699 --> 00:22:21,839
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

308
00:22:22,239 --> 00:22:24,101
[SPEAKER_01]: There is one piece of advice I'd like to throw out there.

309
00:22:24,201 --> 00:22:27,085
[SPEAKER_01]: Please.

310
00:22:27,886 --> 00:22:28,967
[SPEAKER_01]: This is consumer side.

311
00:22:28,987 --> 00:22:40,741
[SPEAKER_01]: When you are working with tech support and they have referred you to another party, ask them their process of elimination that led to that and what do you ask the other party.

312
00:22:41,872 --> 00:22:42,312
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura.com

313
00:23:06,267 --> 00:23:11,449
[SPEAKER_01]: that you have to ask the questions and understand how that conclusion was reached.

314
00:23:11,589 --> 00:23:23,934
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only does that give you more ammunition to seek the answer in the right place, but it also teaches you how your system's going to work so you can learn something to prevent it from happening next time.

315
00:23:24,494 --> 00:23:27,455
[SPEAKER_01]: And learn how to read your manual.

316
00:23:28,195 --> 00:23:29,255
[SPEAKER_01]: Read your user guides.

317
00:23:29,555 --> 00:23:30,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Read your instructions.

318
00:23:30,596 --> 00:23:32,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Look for online knowledge bases.

319
00:23:33,056 --> 00:23:36,777
[SPEAKER_01]: Knowing this information will save you a headache in the future.

320
00:23:37,237 --> 00:23:37,678
[SPEAKER_01]: The end.

321
00:23:38,178 --> 00:23:38,538
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

322
00:23:39,578 --> 00:23:43,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into some news from the week, which admittedly is a little slower this week.

323
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:46,580
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why we have the space to talk a little more about this stuff.

324
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,160
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do have some headlines to cover.

325
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:54,242
[SPEAKER_02]: And Loki, I think you have one to start us off this week about what happened in Microsoft's world.

326
00:23:55,151 --> 00:24:04,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so Microsoft did a kind of a partner showcase showing some of the more like, not necessarily like indie stuff, but like third party.

327
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:11,906
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of it is focused kind of on indie, but it was, yeah, their partner showcase, which had a bunch of trailers with it.

328
00:24:12,686 --> 00:24:16,569
[SPEAKER_05]: So we got some new trailers and some other further confirmations.

329
00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:27,157
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was another trailer for, of course, Alan Wake 2's Lake House DLC, which I think we saw before with the PlayStation showcase event.

330
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:31,260
[SPEAKER_05]: So they confirmed that's now going to be coming on all platforms October 22nd.

331
00:24:33,982 --> 00:24:44,005
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, we got a look at Bloober Team's new horror game, right off the back of Silent Hill 2 Remake, called Kronos, The New Dawn.

332
00:24:44,945 --> 00:24:46,166
[SPEAKER_05]: And it looks creepy.

333
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:50,627
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not creepy, it's Halloween!

334
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:57,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we got a new announcement for a game called Blindfire.

335
00:24:57,586 --> 00:25:11,710
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a game by Double Eleven, whose artwork reminds me a bit too much of Cyberpunk, but it is kind of a Cyberpunk-ish style shooter, so it looks kind of cool.

336
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:26,067
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's supposed to be coming out early access already actually right after the announcement on the Xbox Series X and S and PC then we of course had

337
00:25:30,075 --> 00:25:34,638
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if this is a crazy announcement, but it seems in line with the series.

338
00:25:35,218 --> 00:25:39,020
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have Like a Dragon, Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii.

339
00:25:41,682 --> 00:25:44,964
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds crazy, but it's awesome.

340
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:48,926
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, those games have a lot of over-the-top shit in it, so why not?

341
00:25:49,066 --> 00:25:49,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

342
00:25:49,726 --> 00:25:51,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Pirate Ship, Hawaii, why not?

343
00:25:52,168 --> 00:25:52,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

344
00:25:54,228 --> 00:25:56,452
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks pretty awesome.

345
00:25:56,953 --> 00:25:59,157
[SPEAKER_05]: I am not really sure what to think of it, but...

346
00:25:59,981 --> 00:26:24,922
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's cool could this be the next big pirate game I guess we'll find out uh will there be DLC for Sea of Thieves as a tie-in we will see I don't know it looks absolutely amazing though you know what's interesting though the game I did not realize this but Bobby uh you know we tape after he does and um he's a big Yakuza fan you know um and uh he mentioned they moved it a week up because of Monster Hunter

347
00:26:25,402 --> 00:26:27,903
[SPEAKER_02]: is coming out, was originally going to be that same day in February.

348
00:26:28,223 --> 00:26:35,625
[SPEAKER_02]: So they bumped it up to get out of the way of Monster Hunter, which, of course, you know, is fairly, I mean, it does well here, but it's huge.

349
00:26:36,045 --> 00:26:37,425
[SPEAKER_02]: It's event media in Japan.

350
00:26:38,645 --> 00:26:49,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I can tell you, out of the two games, I'm more excited about the Like a Dragon Pirate game than I am Monster Hunter, so I will actually probably want to check that out.

351
00:26:49,868 --> 00:26:53,489
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks really... It just looks so crazy, it's like I have to

352
00:26:53,629 --> 00:27:09,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Monster Hunter mainline games I love the cell phone one the mainline ones are hard but I'll probably still try it I'll have space for this after I beat the other Like A Dragon games someday write it into my busy schedule

353
00:27:09,733 --> 00:27:31,881
[SPEAKER_02]: although this is um being a spinoff it's it's a guided adventure so it's not it's not like you're getting like a full like 50 70 hour game it's you know gonna be less than 20 but still pretty extensive no can't wait for those pirate takes of the old Sega classics right I think for for like oh WTF kind of parody like I think that's perfect for this actually so I think it'll be cool

354
00:27:33,158 --> 00:27:43,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Another game I've been kind of keeping my eye on ever since they kind of saw the work in progress visuals for it, but now actually having a subtitle to it, Mouse EI for Hire.

355
00:27:44,453 --> 00:27:45,854
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a black and white...

356
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:48,872
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.

357
00:28:14,564 --> 00:28:18,147
[SPEAKER_05]: on pretty much all consoles, so I'm definitely picking that up.

358
00:28:18,167 --> 00:28:22,530
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going public domain next year that we're going to have to suffer through horror adaptations of?

359
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's not, yeah, I mean, it's not a horror game.

360
00:28:25,892 --> 00:28:37,840
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just saying, sorry, I'm on the public domain thing now, and you know I do a lot in the horror space, and you know, anytime something goes public domain, somebody's doing some fucking movie about it, because now they can, so...

361
00:28:39,229 --> 00:28:44,732
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, because they did do a... Didn't they do a... They did a Steamboat Willie horror movie, but it was called something else.

362
00:28:44,812 --> 00:28:46,373
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was... And then, of course, Winnie the Pooh.

363
00:28:46,753 --> 00:28:47,354
[SPEAKER_02]: We all know that.

364
00:28:47,714 --> 00:28:48,635
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and all that stuff.

365
00:28:48,675 --> 00:28:52,857
[SPEAKER_02]: So, like, as these go public domain, somebody's going to make a fucking horror movie out of it.

366
00:28:52,917 --> 00:28:54,538
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'm just kind of curious what's next year.

367
00:28:55,078 --> 00:28:55,499
[SPEAKER_02]: But, sure.

368
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:57,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Video games, Cuphead, cute.

369
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,640
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that style.

370
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I'm not going to hate on it just because it's Steamboat Willie.

371
00:29:01,582 --> 00:29:02,903
[SPEAKER_02]: But, like...

372
00:29:06,562 --> 00:29:17,206
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to hate that we get all of these adaptations of Call of Duty Call of Duty this, Call of Duty that Call of Duty, Modern Warfare this, Modern Warfare that Then you know what, Steamboat Willie?

373
00:29:17,766 --> 00:29:18,806
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to get the same treatment.

374
00:29:18,926 --> 00:29:19,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Enough!

375
00:29:20,867 --> 00:29:25,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so let's see What is entering the public domain next year?

376
00:29:26,089 --> 00:29:30,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Different creators I don't even know and I'm going to tell you how they're going to make a horror movie out of it

377
00:29:32,533 --> 00:30:00,323
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of it is like composers and singers and stuff like that horror movie soundtracks they'll turn them into creepy versions that play in the trailers I mean these would be really old dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun this is like really obscure but there is a cartoon called Mutton Jeff I don't know what that is I know what Mutton Jeff is yeah so there's that uh

378
00:30:02,877 --> 00:30:05,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Marmatone is another cartoon.

379
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:06,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Italian cartoon.

380
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:12,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, this is a rock I wish I hadn't looked under.

381
00:30:12,324 --> 00:30:13,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Go back to the Xbox.

382
00:30:13,605 --> 00:30:14,325
[SPEAKER_02]: A Dog's Life.

383
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:15,006
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

384
00:30:15,066 --> 00:30:16,066
[SPEAKER_05]: A Dog's Life.

385
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,187
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a 1914 movie.

386
00:30:17,287 --> 00:30:20,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't wait to see the horror version of that.

387
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,411
[SPEAKER_02]: The dog inhales cocaine and kills people.

388
00:30:22,711 --> 00:30:23,492
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how they make a horror movie.

389
00:30:23,512 --> 00:30:24,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Cocaine Dog.

390
00:30:24,433 --> 00:30:25,754
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been derivative, but I can see it.

391
00:30:25,774 --> 00:30:26,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Cocaine Dog's Life.

392
00:30:28,756 --> 00:30:30,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Cocaine Dog's Life.

393
00:30:31,317 --> 00:30:32,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that a family guy?

394
00:30:32,858 --> 00:30:38,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, we had a trailer for Subnautica 2, and that's pretty exciting.

395
00:30:38,362 --> 00:30:40,224
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a lot of Subnautica fans.

00:32:52,064 --> 00:32:52,444
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.

417
00:32:52,544 --> 00:32:53,805
[SPEAKER_02]: The dog better not fucking die.

418
00:32:55,305 --> 00:32:56,606
[SPEAKER_02]: That should be the name of the game.

419
00:32:56,646 --> 00:32:57,887
[SPEAKER_02]: The dog better fucking not die.

420
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:00,568
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like the never-ending story.

421
00:33:00,908 --> 00:33:02,109
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking of that scene.

422
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:08,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, Wu-Chang Fallen Feathers is a Souls-like action RPG.

423
00:33:09,853 --> 00:33:11,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally unique concept there.

424
00:33:12,175 --> 00:33:14,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, never heard of a Souls-like clone.

425
00:33:15,357 --> 00:33:16,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Never heard of that.

426
00:33:16,158 --> 00:33:17,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Never.

427
00:33:17,639 --> 00:33:18,220
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

428
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:26,326
[SPEAKER_05]: I think back to the days of Street Fighter clones and Doom clones and... Ah, we miss those days.

429
00:33:27,567 --> 00:33:29,048
[SPEAKER_05]: It's now Souls-like clones.

430
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Now bring back Street Fighter clones.

431
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,251
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss Stick Fighter.

432
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:34,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Stickfire is good, yeah.

433
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,281
[SPEAKER_05]: FBC Firebreak.

434
00:33:37,481 --> 00:33:46,306
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a Left 4 Dead-style co-op shooter in the same universe as Control, and it looks pretty crazy.

435
00:33:47,146 --> 00:33:47,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

436
00:33:47,886 --> 00:33:51,488
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means it's also the Alan Wake and the whole Remedy universe, right?

437
00:33:52,869 --> 00:33:53,409
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess, yeah.

438
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:58,692
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a three-player co-op, and yeah, it looks pretty neat.

439
00:34:02,194 --> 00:34:02,994
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's pretty much it.

440
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:25,838
[SPEAKER_02]: well that's you know for an October event that's uh that's pretty cool not bad yeah not bad interesting stuff in there so it's nice to see Xbox still kind of you know putting things out and you know has their plan and you know to stay competitive with everything else so making Game Pass something people want to have and all that good stuff so good for them all right

441
00:34:26,445 --> 00:34:28,346
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

442
00:34:55,371 --> 00:35:21,243
[SPEAKER_01]: uh was uh yeah i mean it's just the usual there you know i'm gonna play more dead by daylight tonight hopefully and i tried to play some fortnight so yeah fortnight i've been playing palio with with uh brad oh that's fun yeah i need to check that game out and marissa marissa plays love her oh if that's how i have to talk to her i'll install it i will i miss marissa great

443
00:35:22,577 --> 00:35:23,657
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

444
00:35:23,717 --> 00:35:24,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, we'll go to you then.

445
00:35:24,557 --> 00:35:25,238
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your gaming week?

446
00:35:26,238 --> 00:35:29,138
[SPEAKER_05]: My gaming week was pretty much Minecraft.

447
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:34,259
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'm playing Blue Sky, the app.

448
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I'm glad you brought that up because Bobby went a little bit in depth on his show tonight.

449
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,201
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, yeah, like a lot of people are leaving.

450
00:35:43,761 --> 00:35:47,002
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, OK, so now I have a tangent to the tangent.

451
00:35:47,978 --> 00:35:53,239
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that it's fine to deadname X and call it Twitter and everyone still calls it Twitter.

452
00:35:53,679 --> 00:36:01,501
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a part of me that wonders maybe that's the wrong mentality and we should call it X. And the reason why I say that is because Twitter died.

453
00:36:01,901 --> 00:36:02,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter's gone.

454
00:36:02,941 --> 00:36:06,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter got taken out to pasture and shot.

455
00:36:07,602 --> 00:36:08,462
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no more Twitter.

456
00:36:09,243 --> 00:36:14,964
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's a part of me that's like, maybe we ought to call it X to make sure we remind ourselves Twitter is gone, right?

457
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:15,664
[SPEAKER_02]: But

458
00:36:16,184 --> 00:36:40,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever you want to call it, thanks to some of the changes that the idiot in charge made this week With the blocks, you can no longer With the block feature and AI Yeah, the AI thing is huge for artists I mean, a lot of people are talking about the blocks, but I think the AI thing is really pissing off artists But however you want to slice it, people are saying it's time to get off the boat And kind of like

459
00:36:41,517 --> 00:36:43,059
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

460
00:37:00,014 --> 00:37:01,375
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

461
00:37:24,465 --> 00:37:29,267
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want a feed for everything about DragonCon, for example, Bobby made a feed for that.

462
00:37:30,067 --> 00:37:33,208
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want a feed about everything Minecraft, I'm sure that's out there.

463
00:37:34,089 --> 00:37:35,449
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to search the feeds for that.

464
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:39,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably bumps that up to the top and so forth.

465
00:37:39,771 --> 00:37:44,853
[SPEAKER_02]: They also have what's called Starter Packs on Blue Sky.

466
00:37:45,033 --> 00:37:49,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Our pal Bobby Blackwolf actually made one of these over on Blue Sky.

467
00:37:49,635 --> 00:37:52,696
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go to the official VOG Network account, which...

468
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:57,860
[SPEAKER_02]: The interesting thing about Blue Sky is that there's no check marks, right?

469
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,321
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no verified badge.

470
00:37:59,401 --> 00:38:02,542
[SPEAKER_02]: But what you do is you verify your domain.

471
00:38:02,982 --> 00:38:07,865
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a way you set it up where your username becomes your domain.

472
00:38:08,365 --> 00:38:15,789
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, if I go to Blue Sky and I go to the VOG account, it's actually at vognetwork.com is that.

473
00:38:15,949 --> 00:38:16,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas like

474
00:38:16,849 --> 00:38:21,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Most normie users like me, I'm like robroberts.bsky.social.

475
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:23,131
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, most people have the .bsky.social.

476
00:38:23,451 --> 00:38:31,753
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually pretty much authenticate yourself and prove who you are by tying yourself to your domain, which I actually think is a pretty clever way to do it, to be quite honest.

477
00:38:32,193 --> 00:38:37,275
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you go to our Blue Sky feed, which is at vognetwork.com, OLR doesn't have a separate Blue Sky account.

478
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:41,136
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess now's the time to make one, so maybe I'll get on that.

479
00:38:41,196 --> 00:38:50,079
[SPEAKER_02]: But for now, if you go to atvognetwork.com, you can actually see there's a little starter pack, a Voice of Geeks Network pack, and you can actually follow all of us fun personalities.

480
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:59,403
[SPEAKER_02]: There's me, there's Loki, there's Jamie, and even some of our host emeritus, such as Critical Myth, Pod Culture, and some of our just...

481
00:39:00,163 --> 00:39:25,191
[SPEAKER_02]: community members that really get involved like Mish love me some Mish and so forth so like community members that are just super involved we also have in the starter pack if you want to be in this if you're here every week and you want to be in the starter pack just give us a holler and we'll get you in the starter pack or give Bobby a holler I shouldn't say that but honestly I've been on there for a long time you know like I I I

482
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:27,799
[SPEAKER_01]: I've loved it.

483
00:39:28,059 --> 00:39:29,600
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a great experience for me.

484
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:38,484
[SPEAKER_01]: And on top of that, since the TWAT site has become an anti-Semitic hotbed, it's very refreshing to be here.

485
00:39:38,704 --> 00:39:39,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

486
00:39:39,885 --> 00:39:41,845
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will say this about Blue Sky, too.

487
00:39:41,925 --> 00:39:43,046
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not without look.

488
00:39:43,126 --> 00:39:44,707
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to say, oh, it's perfect.

489
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:45,987
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll think I'm on their payroll.

490
00:39:46,427 --> 00:39:52,450
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no pictures and DMs, and they've been promising that for a while, and I'm not sure what's been stopping them.

491
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:54,471
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't upload your own DMs.

492
00:39:54,671 --> 00:39:55,771
[SPEAKER_02]: and Detaching Quoted Posts.

493
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the fact when you can remove yourself from a quote post.

494
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:26,021
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fact when you block somebody, it's a hard fucking block.

495
00:40:26,601 --> 00:40:34,963
[SPEAKER_02]: And they cannot... Not only does it delete everything in the conversation you are having with that person, but they can't see you pretty much at all.

496
00:40:35,343 --> 00:40:40,344
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can actually set your account so that only people who are logged in can see your account.

497
00:40:40,844 --> 00:40:42,784
[SPEAKER_02]: You cannot have a private account.

498
00:40:42,944 --> 00:40:44,585
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is a deal breaker for some people.

499
00:40:45,045 --> 00:40:46,225
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's just because, again...

500
00:40:47,125 --> 00:40:49,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue Sky was not built to be a Twitter replacement.

501
00:40:51,091 --> 00:40:58,422
[SPEAKER_02]: It was built to be an open source protocol and they sort of had different things in their vision and their things that they were going to accomplish.

502
00:40:58,923 --> 00:40:59,464
[SPEAKER_02]: And then...

503
00:41:00,393 --> 00:41:01,293
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

504
00:41:24,122 --> 00:41:27,343
[SPEAKER_02]: And plus it has the kind of like some people really police their domains.

505
00:41:28,784 --> 00:41:31,144
[SPEAKER_02]: The policing that happens on Mastodon is a bit much sometimes.

506
00:41:32,545 --> 00:41:33,445
[SPEAKER_02]: It ruins the vibe there.

507
00:41:33,885 --> 00:41:35,826
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's all I'm going to say about my experience there.

508
00:41:35,846 --> 00:41:41,348
[SPEAKER_05]: It almost sounds like IRC vibes with some of those domains and everything.

509
00:41:41,448 --> 00:41:41,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually...

510
00:41:42,707 --> 00:41:43,287
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not wrong.

511
00:41:43,447 --> 00:41:43,907
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not wrong.

512
00:41:44,188 --> 00:41:45,108
[SPEAKER_01]: You're really not wrong.

513
00:41:45,288 --> 00:41:45,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

514
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:54,691
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but again, like, I'm not, like, again, if somebody tells me, hey, I got rid of X and I went to Mastodon, I'm still going to say, good for you.

515
00:41:54,851 --> 00:41:55,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for you.

516
00:41:55,291 --> 00:41:55,991
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a good choice.

517
00:41:56,511 --> 00:41:58,292
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I'm not here to hate on Mastodon.

518
00:41:59,252 --> 00:42:04,334
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have my account on the twats, is what I'm calling it.

519
00:42:05,414 --> 00:42:08,315
[SPEAKER_01]: Only because that's where I repost when I go live.

520
00:42:08,335 --> 00:42:08,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

521
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:18,403
[SPEAKER_01]: I do keep up with a couple of people, but I really, really, really haven't been paying as much attention to it.

522
00:42:18,503 --> 00:42:20,744
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fading the way that I faded on Facebook.

523
00:42:21,404 --> 00:42:30,027
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say, though, one of the things I did find when I was starting up or building up my account is there's a...

524
00:42:31,548 --> 00:42:41,451
[SPEAKER_05]: An extension you can get for Chrome called Sky Follower Bridge that allows you to find people that you follow on X on Blue Sky.

525
00:42:41,491 --> 00:42:46,733
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not perfect, but it does help you find a lot of people that you're following.

526
00:42:46,813 --> 00:42:48,193
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is a good way to start.

527
00:42:48,493 --> 00:42:51,654
[SPEAKER_05]: And then just, you know, go in those people and find who they're following.

528
00:42:51,734 --> 00:42:54,315
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, you may find everybody you're looking for.

529
00:42:55,436 --> 00:42:59,157
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another thing I've been using less of is things in Google's ecosystem.

530
00:42:59,577 --> 00:42:59,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

531
00:43:02,493 --> 00:43:17,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Sky Follower Bridge, DJ Ranma S in chat who asked what's the name of that extension again and actually the official Blue Sky account actually I almost said tweeted the official Blue Sky account actually bleated about we need to get rid of the skeet thing

532
00:43:18,117 --> 00:43:19,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Posted?

533
00:43:19,438 --> 00:43:19,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, posted.

534
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:21,300
[SPEAKER_02]: You know everybody calls us skeets.

535
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,661
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, we're not 12 years old, people.

536
00:43:23,521 --> 00:43:31,267
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, if you want actual celebrities to come over to this site, but I think there are a lot of people perfectly happy with that not happening.

537
00:43:31,768 --> 00:43:33,069
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do kind of respect that.

538
00:43:33,109 --> 00:43:36,571
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm also like, if you want to have Barack Obama

539
00:43:37,492 --> 00:43:40,433
[SPEAKER_02]: on this website, you're not going to be able to call it Skeets.

540
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:43,993
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to have a name that works a little more professionally.

541
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:51,254
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Bleat because it has the elements and it makes me think of the fun pinball killer in Dead by Daylight, the Bleat.

542
00:43:56,095 --> 00:43:57,535
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a few celebrities here and there.

543
00:43:57,595 --> 00:43:59,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Tiger Class says James Gunn is on Blue Sky.

544
00:43:59,356 --> 00:44:02,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, some of the Star Trek people.

545
00:44:03,736 --> 00:44:04,777
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that played Shaw.

546
00:44:04,997 --> 00:44:05,257
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

547
00:44:05,797 --> 00:44:05,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Todd

548
00:44:07,923 --> 00:44:31,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Dashwick Dashwick is on Blue Sky and Jerry Ryan is on Blue Sky that's a cool dude yeah and Jerry Ryan's like been very approachable on Blue Sky I think she's great so anyway don't if you're gonna go to Blue Sky though just don't fucking ruin the vibes don't ruin the vibes don't quote people that dunk on them just block them block them when I heard that

549
00:44:32,426 --> 00:44:34,427
[SPEAKER_02]: A certain... I'll just say Laura Loomer.

550
00:44:34,507 --> 00:44:37,229
[SPEAKER_02]: When I heard Laura Loomer showed up on Blue Sky, I just proactively blocked her.

551
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:38,810
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not want to see her shit.

552
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:40,692
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care what she has to say.

553
00:44:40,812 --> 00:44:41,432
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not care.

554
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:42,133
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to see it.

555
00:44:42,493 --> 00:44:43,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody is owed engagement.

556
00:44:44,354 --> 00:44:44,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Done.

557
00:44:44,754 --> 00:44:45,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Blocked.

558
00:44:45,415 --> 00:44:46,435
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't ever have to see it.

559
00:44:47,516 --> 00:44:51,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Should the wizard book lady ever show up, I will be blocking her immediately.

560
00:44:51,419 --> 00:44:52,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Immediately.

561
00:44:52,179 --> 00:44:54,281
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no interest in anything that woman has to say.

562
00:44:55,447 --> 00:44:58,129
[SPEAKER_02]: until she offers a very meaty apology.

563
00:44:58,329 --> 00:44:58,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaningful.

564
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:00,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Financial apology.

565
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:01,411
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's going to happen.

566
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:01,931
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not.

567
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:03,973
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I'm okay with blocking her in a millisecond.

568
00:45:04,453 --> 00:45:05,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, yeah, don't ruin the vibes.

569
00:45:05,934 --> 00:45:06,755
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a joke when I'm mad.

570
00:45:06,795 --> 00:45:08,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not go to Blue Sky to ruin the vibes.

571
00:45:09,156 --> 00:45:11,778
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you are like, Blue Sky is a leftist haven.

572
00:45:12,038 --> 00:45:12,559
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

573
00:45:12,699 --> 00:45:13,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

574
00:45:13,139 --> 00:45:13,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay where you are.

575
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:14,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

576
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Glad we agree.

577
00:45:16,161 --> 00:45:16,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

578
00:45:17,242 --> 00:45:18,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying Blue Sky is a leftist haven.

579
00:45:19,043 --> 00:45:23,366
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying maybe you shouldn't be there then.

580
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:27,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, we'll enjoy this while it lasts.

581
00:45:28,019 --> 00:45:29,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Something will fuck it all up.

582
00:45:29,399 --> 00:45:30,099
[SPEAKER_02]: It always does.

583
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:31,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Something's going to fuck it all up.

584
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,300
[SPEAKER_02]: But we survived.

585
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:34,280
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

586
00:45:34,361 --> 00:45:39,942
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are of a certain age on the internet, you survived LiveJournal going away, RIP LiveJournal.

587
00:45:40,602 --> 00:45:42,503
[SPEAKER_02]: You survived Myspace going away.

588
00:45:43,103 --> 00:45:44,803
[SPEAKER_02]: You survived Friendster going away.

589
00:45:46,344 --> 00:45:49,585
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in my rainbow clan, you survived Gay.com going away.

590
00:45:49,605 --> 00:45:49,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

591
00:45:51,551 --> 00:45:56,855
[SPEAKER_02]: You will survive X, Twitter, whatever going away as well.

592
00:45:57,216 --> 00:45:58,236
[SPEAKER_02]: We will rebuild.

593
00:45:59,738 --> 00:46:00,018
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

594
00:46:01,479 --> 00:46:02,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, let's move on.

595
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:03,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I should talk about my gaming week.

596
00:46:03,681 --> 00:46:05,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, did you finish your gaming week?

597
00:46:05,482 --> 00:46:08,504
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you talked about Blue Sky turned into a 10-minute tangent or whatever.

598
00:46:08,585 --> 00:46:09,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I did.

599
00:46:09,605 --> 00:46:09,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

600
00:46:10,866 --> 00:46:11,547
[SPEAKER_02]: My gaming week.

601
00:46:12,007 --> 00:46:13,969
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing Diablo 4 because, of course, I have.

602
00:46:14,029 --> 00:46:15,610
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been enjoying the variety of activities.

603
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:16,531
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I'm not bored.

604
00:46:16,551 --> 00:46:18,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, there's so many things to do in endgame.

605
00:46:19,013 --> 00:46:19,813
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been enjoying it.

606
00:46:19,913 --> 00:46:20,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

607
00:46:20,714 --> 00:46:22,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Diablo 4 Beauty and the Beast

608
00:46:41,977 --> 00:46:42,478
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

609
00:46:58,755 --> 00:47:05,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch the Beauty and the Beast one because something really funny happens halfway through and it was really fucking enraging at the time.

610
00:47:05,461 --> 00:47:07,623
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is really funny in retrospect.

611
00:47:07,663 --> 00:47:11,767
[SPEAKER_02]: So check that out and learn about the sensitivity of the Intellivision disc controller.

612
00:47:11,827 --> 00:47:16,531
[SPEAKER_02]: It is something to behold.

613
00:47:17,011 --> 00:47:22,536
[SPEAKER_02]: And then my Friday video, I played the original Metroid and I streamed that on Thursday night.

614
00:47:22,877 --> 00:47:23,517
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the thing.

615
00:47:24,554 --> 00:47:31,556
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to stream the original Super Mario Brothers and then I was going to do like a Mario Marathon, Mario 1, 2, and 3.

616
00:47:32,536 --> 00:47:41,739
[SPEAKER_02]: I severely underestimated how rough Super Mario 1 was going to go because I said, well, I'm going to do this without warping.

617
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:45,740
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to make this look, because if I do, I'll beat this in less than 10 minutes if I use warp.

618
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,581
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to beat this without warping.

619
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:51,582
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot that you only have three lives in the game.

620
00:47:52,262 --> 00:47:56,745
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not perfected the 99 lives turtle staircase trick over the years.

621
00:47:57,065 --> 00:47:58,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's something I need to practice.

622
00:47:59,126 --> 00:47:59,806
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I do.

623
00:48:01,167 --> 00:48:02,868
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's that.

624
00:48:02,948 --> 00:48:11,893
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I died in world three, which is fine because chat reminded me, oh, if you hit A and continue, you start at the beginning of the same world.

625
00:48:12,273 --> 00:48:12,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so bad.

626
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:13,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

627
00:48:13,634 --> 00:48:17,076
[SPEAKER_02]: So then we kept going and I got to world five and I died again.

628
00:48:17,836 --> 00:48:19,777
[SPEAKER_02]: and I forgot to hit a continue.

629
00:48:19,937 --> 00:48:22,997
[SPEAKER_02]: My brain just reflexed and said, all right, back up an atom.

630
00:48:23,017 --> 00:48:25,158
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just hit start with it, how ending a continue.

631
00:48:25,638 --> 00:48:29,419
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was all the way back at the beginning and I was pissed.

632
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,400
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, well, video's done.

633
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,000
[SPEAKER_02]: And you might be thinking, Rob, why don't you just use a save state?

634
00:48:35,361 --> 00:48:36,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you just rewind?

635
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:40,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Because my ego...

636
00:48:42,080 --> 00:49:09,625
[SPEAKER_02]: when we talk about using retro achievements has to use something called hardcore mode where those features are not available and if you turn hardcore mode on those features are not available and so those features were not available now do I need to go back and maybe turn that off and try Super Mario again yes perhaps I will humble myself a little bit and perhaps that is how we will do the game next time um

637
00:49:10,836 --> 00:49:11,636
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

638
00:49:36,266 --> 00:49:37,246
[SPEAKER_02]: DeathWarp DeathWarp

639
00:49:57,592 --> 00:50:05,995
[SPEAKER_02]: and there is another tunnel all the way up to the right and you basically just have to use the respawning block trick to get all the way to the top.

640
00:50:06,155 --> 00:50:08,376
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how you're like supposed to do it.

641
00:50:10,236 --> 00:50:18,559
[SPEAKER_02]: But despite those problems and then dying once at Mother Brain, actually I died twice at Mother Brain, but despite all this, I beat the game.

642
00:50:18,739 --> 00:50:24,301
[SPEAKER_02]: I beat the game in one stream and it actually clocked in at under three hours, which means I got swimsuit Samus.

643
00:50:25,385 --> 00:50:27,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I got one-piece swimsuit Samus.

644
00:50:28,387 --> 00:50:34,229
[SPEAKER_02]: You actually have to beat the game in under an hour to get two-piece bikini Samus.

645
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:39,752
[SPEAKER_02]: So, at some point, I will need to go back and try harder to beat the game in under an hour.

646
00:50:40,112 --> 00:50:45,715
[SPEAKER_02]: But now that I know better some of the pathing, I really should have gotten the Screw Attack a lot sooner.

647
00:50:45,975 --> 00:50:49,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I only used a Nintendo Power kind of map.

648
00:50:49,617 --> 00:51:10,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not use like an entire guide or anything to sort of like tell me what to get when and all that I was just kind of like went based off muscle memory and I really should have got the screw attack when I got the high jump boots and I think if I'd done that it probably would have gone a little smoother for me um and now that I know I don't have to death port in once I beat Kraid that'll make it easier too so I might actually try it again sometime we'll see

649
00:51:12,091 --> 00:51:16,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Tiger Claw says the Justin Bailey code unlocks Swimsuit Samus and all the power-ups and weapons.

650
00:51:16,415 --> 00:51:23,744
[SPEAKER_02]: I do know that, and that is something I guess I could use, but I think to get that... I don't know who doesn't know that.

651
00:51:24,204 --> 00:51:29,731
[SPEAKER_02]: To get the actual achievement in Retro Achievements, I think you have to do it without passcodes.

652
00:51:31,075 --> 00:51:33,316
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the achievement actually locks out passcodes.

653
00:51:33,336 --> 00:51:35,997
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to play it basically in one sitting or with save states.

654
00:51:36,597 --> 00:51:38,238
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, original Metroid.

655
00:51:38,938 --> 00:51:42,059
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really cool that like I could still beat it in under three hours.

656
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:48,942
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of wasn't expecting to get the next, you know, I think there's four different endings and I would have gotten the second best one.

657
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:50,222
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was kind of surprising to me.

658
00:51:50,322 --> 00:51:51,143
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, okay, cool.

659
00:51:51,163 --> 00:51:51,543
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take it.

660
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:56,394
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't a 100% run either, but not far off.

661
00:51:56,454 --> 00:51:58,396
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I had 215 missiles.

662
00:51:59,177 --> 00:52:00,999
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think I collected most missiles.

663
00:52:02,601 --> 00:52:02,861
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

664
00:52:02,921 --> 00:52:07,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, let's move on and we're going to talk about other things going on in gaming news.

665
00:52:07,466 --> 00:52:09,188
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to kick it over to Loki.

666
00:52:10,515 --> 00:52:10,875
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

667
00:52:12,615 --> 00:52:19,757
[SPEAKER_05]: So we saw this article with Shawn Layden talking about the collapse of the game industry.

668
00:52:20,597 --> 00:52:25,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Shawn Layden, for those who don't remember, is the former SIE Worldwide Studios chairman.

669
00:52:26,618 --> 00:52:33,300
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, of course, working with Sony as part of their PlayStation brand.

670
00:52:34,692 --> 00:52:53,219
[SPEAKER_05]: and uh based off the article in Game Industry Biz uh said you know if we're going to rely or if we're just going to rely on blockbusters to get us through I think that's a death sentence um basically saying that you know there's a large cost to making these blockbuster games and if they don't

671
00:52:54,181 --> 00:52:57,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Succeed, then you're going to lose a ton of revenue.

672
00:52:58,264 --> 00:53:11,192
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're looking at sequels, you're looking at copycats because the finance guy who draws the line says, well, if Fortnite made this much money in the amount of time, my Fortnite knockoff can make this much money in that amount of time.

673
00:53:11,632 --> 00:53:20,718
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're seeing a collapse of creativity in games with studio consolidation and the high cost of production.

674
00:53:21,478 --> 00:53:30,047
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the focus seems to be on how we're monetizing a game versus what is the game going to be and how is it unique and how is it going to draw players.

675
00:53:30,968 --> 00:53:32,629
[SPEAKER_05]: He says it's plateaued.

676
00:53:32,669 --> 00:53:35,052
[SPEAKER_05]: We're at a stage of hardware development that I call

677
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Only dogs can hear the difference.

678
00:53:38,254 --> 00:53:43,837
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're playing your game and the sunlight is coming through your window on your TV, you're not going to see any ray tracing.

679
00:53:43,857 --> 00:53:45,157
[SPEAKER_05]: It has to be super optimal.

680
00:53:45,177 --> 00:53:48,919
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to have to have an 8K monitor in a dark room to see these things.

681
00:53:49,460 --> 00:54:02,546
[SPEAKER_05]: And I kind of agree, especially when we were seeing the side-by-side comparison with the PlayStation 5 and the PlayStation 5 Pro, it was pretty hard to see the difference.

682
00:54:02,626 --> 00:54:06,028
[SPEAKER_05]: If they didn't zoom in to point out what the differences were,

683
00:54:07,685 --> 00:54:32,189
[SPEAKER_05]: it's almost undiscernible at that point um and yeah i mean i think that we could be you know a lot of this lack of innovating is hurting the industry i mean we just saw that with um you know some of the games coming out from these different uh publishers you know sony just had a massive flop on their hands um

684
00:54:33,911 --> 00:54:38,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think they do have to innovate, and that's why some of these indies are doing really well as well.

685
00:54:40,717 --> 00:54:51,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Questbuster in chat says, to add to this, Layden was also quoted at another event from a few months ago for saying that the rising cost of AAA games was becoming unsustainable.

686
00:54:51,065 --> 00:54:51,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

687
00:54:52,467 --> 00:54:54,228
[SPEAKER_02]: ZenMonkey says, yeah, gaming is cooked.

688
00:54:54,308 --> 00:54:55,529
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to do something new.

689
00:54:57,251 --> 00:54:59,532
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really tricky sort of dance, isn't it?

690
00:54:59,593 --> 00:55:00,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Because...

691
00:55:02,013 --> 00:55:18,787
[SPEAKER_05]: for sure like I was gonna say like I think the hard part about it is the fact that they're just trying to justify more expensive games and they're trying to do it in a sense it's almost like in a bubble like yes I understand that better visuals may take more time to develop and stuff like that

692
00:55:20,029 --> 00:55:45,889
[SPEAKER_05]: but at the same time when you're raising the price of your game then the expectation of those games rises as well and I gotta say like whether even games are $69 or $59 to release a game and then have it be in such a state that you have to release your roadmap on how you're going to fix the game that's unacceptable at any price point I believe like unless it's a free-to-play game

693
00:55:46,952 --> 00:56:16,318
[SPEAKER_05]: it's not really like you're basically saying hey yeah we know we released it in this broken state and your finished game may never come to you like you may never get a working version of the game depends on how much we sell it and honestly like then put your game in early access then if you know the game is in this state then release the game as early access make it very upfront saying hey we know that we messed up because a lot of times they try to pretend and they try to hide it and then on top of that that's assuming that in a bubble that you know

694
00:56:17,386 --> 00:56:18,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

695
00:56:37,628 --> 00:56:38,089
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

696
00:56:49,028 --> 00:56:53,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Better at all than something that came before it for a quarter of the price.

697
00:56:53,791 --> 00:56:55,172
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just it doesn't make sense.

698
00:56:56,473 --> 00:57:05,658
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think there's like one quote from Sean Layden in this whole piece that I'm like, yes, this because I feel like we have been saying that on this program for quite some time.

699
00:57:06,158 --> 00:57:06,639
[SPEAKER_02]: It's this.

700
00:57:07,279 --> 00:57:13,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if Fortnite made this much money in this amount of time, my Fortnite knockoff can make this in that amount of time.

701
00:57:14,039 --> 00:57:14,479
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it can't.

702
00:57:14,739 --> 00:57:15,160
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it can't.

703
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:20,662
[SPEAKER_02]: You cannot force something to go viral in the way that certain games do.

704
00:57:20,763 --> 00:57:27,526
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like people that think, oh, if I do this certain dance on TikTok that's very popular right now, I'm going to get all these followers and all this stuff.

705
00:57:28,246 --> 00:57:34,870
[SPEAKER_02]: That sort of community is a very hard thing to grow organically and you're not going to do it from ripping someone else off.

706
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:42,474
[SPEAKER_02]: And in a way, the gaming industry is almost a victim of its own success because the problem is Fortnite doesn't fucking end.

707
00:57:44,145 --> 00:58:08,670
[SPEAKER_02]: especially like Battle Royale in particular because now we could also go down the road that Fortnite is actually a platform at this point that now there's other games in that so that you are still always playing the Fortnite ecosystem you are always playing that and once again like just because you clone something doesn't mean it's going to be successful because once again like why would I play your clone when I can play the real thing

708
00:58:09,758 --> 00:58:11,980
[SPEAKER_05]: for, you know, essentially cheaper.

709
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:14,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, perfect example, Fortnite and Concord.

710
00:58:15,722 --> 00:58:18,304
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Concord's more of a hero shooter, so Overwatch, I guess.

711
00:58:18,985 --> 00:58:21,927
[SPEAKER_05]: So Overwatch 2, you know, free to play game.

712
00:58:23,408 --> 00:58:37,858
[SPEAKER_05]: I could play that, or you want me to pay into this thing that is not even finished, and then you pull the plug on it a week later, because it was clearly, you know, everyone was telling you this doesn't look good.

713
00:58:38,319 --> 00:59:07,360
[SPEAKER_05]: and you're like nope full speed ahead you know we didn't learn anything we're just charging forward we're gonna make as much money off this as we can and hope for the best and it's just like didn't you do any market research like what kind of market research did you do beforehand like do you not have people telling you like that yeah because this is popular doesn't mean that you're going to make something equally popular you have to have a unique take on it that draws in players if you just go yeah we're doing what they do but maybe not as good

714
00:59:08,934 --> 00:59:09,794
[SPEAKER_05]: No one's going to buy it.

715
00:59:11,475 --> 00:59:14,375
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to a chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

716
00:59:14,695 --> 00:59:22,496
[SPEAKER_02]: SGO100Matt says, instead of trying to make the next blockbuster game clone based off a successful indie title, maybe take chances and support these indie titles.

717
00:59:22,877 --> 00:59:26,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there are, you know, again, it's the diamond in the rough.

718
00:59:26,637 --> 00:59:29,198
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that random thing that goes viral on TikTok.

719
00:59:29,658 --> 00:59:33,838
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, there are a lot of indie games that really do take over the industry, right?

720
00:59:33,878 --> 00:59:35,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Among Us is a great example.

721
00:59:35,439 --> 00:59:37,099
[SPEAKER_02]: And not even necessarily indie games.

722
00:59:37,719 --> 01:00:04,241
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah like look at look at like just for example let's just take um what Sony's done recently so Sony released Astro Bot and you look at their platform like look at the Sony PlayStation 5 what is it lacking it's lacking a lot of those family-friendly platformer games that you can find on like say the Switch and stuff you know back in the PlayStation 2 era you had a lot of those Jack and Daxter um Ratchet and Clank you know that type of stuff

723
01:00:05,261 --> 01:00:33,683
[SPEAKER_05]: even I guess even going back to oh gosh Crash Bandicoot stuff like that and now you don't really have a lot of those and so when you have this title come in that's extremely polished and it fills that void that was on your platform like that's what makes a successful game something that people are craving for if you just give them hey here's another hero shooter you know looter game you know

724
01:00:33,903 --> 01:00:34,564
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

725
01:00:36,006 --> 01:00:38,109
[SPEAKER_02]: That will continue to take your money.

726
01:00:38,149 --> 01:00:39,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I think is very important too.

727
01:00:39,891 --> 01:00:42,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Astro Bot does not continue to take your money.

728
01:00:42,675 --> 01:00:42,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

729
01:00:43,076 --> 01:00:44,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Concord was set up to do that.

730
01:00:45,120 --> 01:01:12,061
[SPEAKER_05]: so so it's it's just like you put it out there and it fills a void and something people were looking for and not only that it strengthens your platform altogether because now you have something you know whereas if I was looking for a specific console like say I didn't have any consoles and it's like well man I really like platformer games well Switch has a lot of those and uh well PlayStation doesn't really have a lot of those and Xbox doesn't really have a lot of those so I guess I'm buying a Switch you know it

731
01:01:12,641 --> 01:01:14,182
[SPEAKER_05]: It helps drive that.

732
01:01:14,723 --> 01:01:17,685
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know why they wouldn't look at that.

733
01:01:17,925 --> 01:01:21,228
[SPEAKER_05]: And I understand that there's certain... I mean, it's about money.

734
01:01:21,268 --> 01:01:23,609
[SPEAKER_05]: They look at how much money this made.

735
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:25,851
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to make that kind of money.

736
01:01:25,971 --> 01:01:27,592
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they try to copy it and...

737
01:01:28,433 --> 01:01:29,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and some businesses that works.

738
01:01:29,654 --> 01:01:30,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at YouTube.

739
01:01:30,414 --> 01:01:35,017
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, copying other people works just fine, and there's no repercussions for that.

740
01:01:35,497 --> 01:01:49,925
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's hard to say, but when we're talking about a billion-dollar, many-billion-dollar industry, trillion-dollar industry probably at this point, yeah, you can't be doing that anymore.

741
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:51,661
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at some other comments.

742
01:01:51,701 --> 01:02:00,027
[SPEAKER_02]: QuestBuster says, to build on what Rob has said, that's what Ubisoft has been trying to do for the past few years, chasing trends in the hopes that they can replicate the same success of their rivals.

743
01:02:00,348 --> 01:02:03,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's why Ubisoft is – we've talked about this before.

744
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:16,841
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a horribly mismanaged company, and Ubisoft really deserves to – I hate to say it because there's a lot of hardworking people on the front lines of Ubisoft, but the problem is when your CEO is also part owner –

745
01:02:17,895 --> 01:02:18,775
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you going to be able to do?

746
01:02:19,315 --> 01:02:22,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, we have more coming up on Ubisoft later, so I don't want to get too far into it.

747
01:02:23,136 --> 01:02:30,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Ubisoft is a problem, and the problem is the CEO who's chasing this bullshit and is getting exactly what he deserves in that sense.

748
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:34,398
[SPEAKER_05]: What's funny there is they're competing with themselves and they're losing.

749
01:02:34,458 --> 01:02:35,338
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you do that?

750
01:02:35,558 --> 01:02:41,179
[SPEAKER_05]: They put out a game that had pirate ships in it and piracy, and it's worse than their new pirate game.

751
01:02:41,679 --> 01:02:42,580
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you do that?

752
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:44,420
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got the mechanics, just...

753
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:47,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Bring that into a new game and make it better.

754
01:02:47,181 --> 01:02:49,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are you just like, oh, hold on, let's ruin it all too.

755
01:02:49,761 --> 01:02:52,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it doesn't make any sense.

756
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:53,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's for sure.

757
01:02:54,523 --> 01:02:56,663
[SPEAKER_02]: ZenMonkey11 says you have to fault gamers too.

758
01:02:56,703 --> 01:03:01,725
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a time that they tried new stuff and gamers shat on it saying they wanted sequels and remakes.

759
01:03:03,086 --> 01:03:21,792
[SPEAKER_05]: well yeah but you know no no like they want to blame the industry they want to blame the gamers and I get it that they go with trends but also they try to drive trends because if it was just what gamers wanted then we probably wouldn't be complaining because we'd be getting what we wanted it's not that it is just uh

760
01:03:22,518 --> 01:03:26,379
[SPEAKER_05]: And it could be that they even try different things, but those different things are awful.

761
01:03:26,479 --> 01:03:34,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, for example, it's not really different, but Suicide Squad, they tried something different than what they normally were making, and it was awful.

762
01:03:35,542 --> 01:03:36,862
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

763
01:03:36,962 --> 01:03:38,463
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate to blame...

764
01:03:40,204 --> 01:03:41,486
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the consumer that's wrong.

765
01:03:41,826 --> 01:03:42,788
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's not.

766
01:03:43,088 --> 01:03:46,553
[SPEAKER_05]: The consumer is right in the sense that they know what they want.

767
01:03:46,813 --> 01:03:50,238
[SPEAKER_02]: They put a lot of bullshit in Suicide Squad I didn't need, too.

768
01:03:50,278 --> 01:03:52,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Forever making money.

769
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:56,887
[SPEAKER_01]: To say that phrase properly, the customer is always right in matters of taste.

770
01:03:57,802 --> 01:04:09,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, and what I'm trying to say, not necessarily that they only want sequels, but it's more like we want that good thing that was in this game, and we want that to be in other games, but also make it better.

771
01:04:09,474 --> 01:04:13,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Not, hey, we just want 50 sequels for this game, like Assassin's Creed.

772
01:04:13,458 --> 01:04:13,699
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't...

773
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:23,689
[SPEAKER_05]: We like the original Assassin's Creed or the few original games, but we think that would be really cool in this setting.

774
01:04:24,009 --> 01:04:29,655
[SPEAKER_05]: But instead, they're like, okay, and we're going to add mythological creatures and magic and all sorts of other nonsense.

775
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:32,938
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, well, no, I don't want that.

776
01:04:33,159 --> 01:04:33,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

777
01:04:34,121 --> 01:04:37,064
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like that part.

778
01:04:38,405 --> 01:04:39,406
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Saints Row.

779
01:04:39,526 --> 01:04:54,958
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the original Saints Row, a couple of games, but then when it started getting too stupid, I did like that because I liked certain elements of the game, but that didn't mean that I wanted them to keep making sequels to the point where it was just a completely different game at that point.

780
01:04:55,178 --> 01:04:55,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

781
01:04:56,076 --> 01:04:59,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Bonds006 with a great comment here in chat saying, we did not ask for NFT.

782
01:05:00,117 --> 01:05:01,418
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great fucking point.

783
01:05:01,698 --> 01:05:07,539
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of times the industry is like shoving these things down our face that it just says, well, this is what the consumers told us.

784
01:05:07,799 --> 01:05:08,980
[SPEAKER_02]: No, nobody fucking told you that.

785
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:10,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Analysts told you that.

786
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Money motivated people told you that.

787
01:05:13,081 --> 01:05:17,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody actually playing the video games told you they wanted to go spend more money on this meaningless shit.

788
01:05:18,402 --> 01:05:19,502
[SPEAKER_02]: and look at how well it went.

789
01:05:19,562 --> 01:05:34,106
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I would argue the same thing is starting to happen with AI to some extent because look, look at the backlash that X is getting now because of the AI picking up and all this stuff and now people are leaving for another social media platform.

790
01:05:34,426 --> 01:05:36,607
[SPEAKER_02]: How many people are fucking pissed off that Google

791
01:05:37,287 --> 01:06:05,758
[SPEAKER_02]: they didn't fucking ask for the AI results they just show up by default or Facebook when you go to say something like you know I want to find like it just like meta AI again in your fucking face I didn't fucking ask for the AI this is a big problem that I think a lot of people have and before you go labeling me anti anti AI I'm not because I understand that it has its usages in other places it's a good tool in some places it's a good conversation starter for lack of a better term

792
01:06:06,118 --> 01:06:25,735
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a good thing when that's the thing you want but I don't know who fucking told these game developers that like AI art and shit was stuff that we wanted to pay $70 for yeah well they're trying to instead of using it as a tool to aid yeah trying to use it as a replacement right

793
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:28,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they're trying to take the shortcut.

794
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:49,203
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

795
01:07:09,844 --> 01:07:24,000
[SPEAKER_02]: AI is a tool for art AI is not a replacement for art there's a very clear difference between those two things and I think you are seeing the population is really starting to push back when you

796
01:07:24,781 --> 01:07:25,781
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

797
01:07:43,806 --> 01:07:44,146
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't wanna...

798
01:08:12,518 --> 01:08:28,216
[SPEAKER_02]: support this game in good faith only I want to make sure this is a polished game that has the value of $70 I want to get my hands on this game before I totally throw my weight behind it but if this is a polished product and a good game we need to support it

799
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:41,187
[SPEAKER_02]: because Baldur's Gate 3 is an excellent example of that game did phenomenally well and a lot of it is because it gave gamers what they really want.

800
01:08:41,787 --> 01:08:55,135
[SPEAKER_02]: A good fucking story, a good experience, all in one package without any DLC, season pass, extra bullshit for the price they were asking for it and it was a great experience.

801
01:08:56,574 --> 01:09:20,767
[SPEAKER_02]: and if Expedition 33 is going to go along those same lines which god I hope it does then I and I hope it's good I hope it does successful because that's good if you want to show it's good if you want to show game developers I want more turn-based RPGs here you go hopefully it's got to be good it's got to be good before I can say you know I don't know yet I'm not going to base that off a trailer but hopefully it's good I'm rooting for it I really am so

802
01:09:22,372 --> 01:09:24,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's move on.

803
01:09:25,136 --> 01:09:26,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Good topic though, good discussion.

804
01:09:26,397 --> 01:09:32,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk a little bit about what's going on at Riot because unfortunately it is some not so great news, I hate to say.

805
01:09:32,886 --> 01:09:36,611
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is that Riot unfortunately has done some more layoffs.

806
01:09:37,792 --> 01:09:43,177
[SPEAKER_02]: That happened this week where, and earlier this year, Riot already laid off a pretty significant number of people.

807
01:09:44,057 --> 01:09:53,205
[SPEAKER_02]: But this week, Riot laid off 32 employees, 27 of them active League of Legends developers and five more from the publishing division at Riot.

808
01:09:54,266 --> 01:10:00,931
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, there was a statement talking about, it's making sure we have the right expertise so League continues to be great for another 15 years to be on.

809
01:10:01,171 --> 01:10:03,433
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't about reducing headcount to save money.

810
01:10:03,793 --> 01:10:05,755
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not slowing down work on the game you love.

811
01:10:06,115 --> 01:10:11,556
[SPEAKER_02]: We're investing heavily in solving today's challenges faster while also building for the future.

812
01:10:11,716 --> 01:10:14,977
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea what the fuck that means.

813
01:10:15,437 --> 01:10:16,637
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck does that mean?

814
01:10:19,117 --> 01:10:24,718
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, that's just like... It means these are some words to distract so we don't actually have to answer the question.

815
01:10:24,838 --> 01:10:30,619
[SPEAKER_02]: This is me trying to make you feel better about these people's jobs by telling you don't worry, the game isn't going to suck.

816
01:10:31,019 --> 01:10:32,860
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I'm getting out of that.

817
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:34,760
[SPEAKER_02]: That says nothing about...

818
01:10:37,076 --> 01:10:39,679
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't about reducing headcount to save money.

819
01:10:41,821 --> 01:10:43,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Then what the fuck was it?

820
01:10:45,565 --> 01:10:50,430
[SPEAKER_02]: The bullshit smell is so strong I can smell it all the way from LA.

821
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:51,991
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not just Koalinga.

822
01:10:52,372 --> 01:10:55,375
[SPEAKER_02]: I can smell it from this person's mouth all the way from LA where Riot is at.

823
01:10:57,597 --> 01:11:04,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, they are giving staff a six-month severance, so an annual bonus, health coverage, job placement assistance.

824
01:11:04,759 --> 01:11:10,600
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, at least hooray to it being somewhat humane, but this is still very frustrating shit to hear about.

825
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:13,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Riot, of course, League of Legends.

826
01:11:14,041 --> 01:11:24,604
[SPEAKER_02]: There is also an MMO they're apparently working on, but I guess the rumor is that things were reset on that because the MMO was feeling too much like League of Legends itself.

827
01:11:25,627 --> 01:11:30,603
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know how much that plays into this whole thing, but yeah, interesting.

828
01:11:31,462 --> 01:11:33,103
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

829
01:12:01,809 --> 01:12:05,073
[SPEAKER_02]: and all I'm going to say is roll up the windows and turn your air on circulate in your car.

830
01:12:05,113 --> 01:12:06,235
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a reason I take 99.

831
01:12:07,716 --> 01:12:14,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, or take 99, which unfortunately is a great option from Sacramento, not a great option from San Francisco.

832
01:12:15,666 --> 01:12:19,111
[SPEAKER_02]: So most people are stuck doing the five from SF or Bay Area in general.

833
01:12:19,878 --> 01:12:20,818
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

834
01:12:42,566 --> 01:12:45,089
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know, and I'm the worst at remembering.

835
01:12:45,129 --> 01:12:48,693
[SPEAKER_02]: So why don't we just go on to the present, the new, the shiny, DarkSakura, what's new and shiny this week?

836
01:13:01,124 --> 01:13:03,666
[SPEAKER_01]: So Unity has launched Unity 6.

837
01:13:04,447 --> 01:13:16,757
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has native Windows ARM support, which is, hey, ARM, you know, for people who work on tablet systems or might be emulating from a PC.

838
01:13:19,079 --> 01:13:20,621
[SPEAKER_01]: An Apple Silicon device.

839
01:13:22,202 --> 01:13:30,949
[SPEAKER_01]: But at any rate, the good thing about that is that it actually can run really well now on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

840
01:13:33,051 --> 01:13:35,493
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supposed to be...

841
01:13:37,134 --> 01:13:44,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Also coming with an updated AI library, which I mean, this is, I think, more of an assistive AI.

842
01:13:44,998 --> 01:13:48,440
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to look a little bit more into that, but it also has improved graphics performance.

843
01:13:50,501 --> 01:13:57,444
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so this is basically the AI tool in here is for response from camera, microphone, and sensors in game.

844
01:13:58,545 --> 01:13:58,685
[SPEAKER_01]: And

845
01:14:00,262 --> 01:14:12,196
[SPEAKER_01]: you can also adjust the user interface it looks like a little bit more on the fly they allow you to use ProBuilder and Cinemachine and they are also

846
01:14:14,572 --> 01:14:18,815
[SPEAKER_01]: Putting in that arm support as well for people who use the Snapdragon X computers.

847
01:14:19,616 --> 01:14:21,998
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this is going to be pretty good.

848
01:14:22,118 --> 01:14:26,802
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, I've actually just started a development in Unity course myself.

849
01:14:26,922 --> 01:14:33,087
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd really like to see if the course I'm taking actually starts moving on to doing their stuff for Unity 6.

850
01:14:33,147 --> 01:14:34,108
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be really cool.

851
01:14:34,649 --> 01:14:38,312
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also does offer...

852
01:14:39,933 --> 01:14:42,934
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit more, of course, the better computer that you have.

853
01:14:44,455 --> 01:14:55,980
[SPEAKER_01]: They have compatibility with Maya, the Creative Cloud apps, but those, of course, do not run on Snapdragon X. So just a little quick one out there for our game dev friends.

854
01:14:57,081 --> 01:14:59,362
[SPEAKER_01]: and people who like making VTubers.

855
01:14:59,802 --> 01:15:03,444
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Unity had a lot of shit that was going on last year.

856
01:15:03,604 --> 01:15:13,048
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it is important to note because a lot of times we say it should be the people at the top that are the ones to pay the price for when things go wrong.

857
01:15:13,488 --> 01:15:14,669
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say this.

858
01:15:14,709 --> 01:15:23,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, everybody needs to make their own decision about what platform works for them, but if you look at who's running Unity now versus who was running Unity a year ago, it has changed nearly completely.

859
01:15:25,213 --> 01:15:25,934
[SPEAKER_02]: For what it's worth,

860
01:15:27,583 --> 01:15:30,285
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we say ought to happen in those types of situations.

861
01:15:30,926 --> 01:15:31,947
[SPEAKER_02]: It has happened at Unity.

862
01:15:32,248 --> 01:15:39,916
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe if that helps clear up some of the issues you were having with Unity, I think it might be worth looking into.

863
01:15:41,049 --> 01:15:46,135
[SPEAKER_02]: So and I think it's on us to let you know about those types of things, too, because we ask for those things.

864
01:15:46,376 --> 01:15:48,158
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think that has been very well reported.

865
01:15:48,498 --> 01:15:50,280
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it was reported John Riccatello left.

866
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:54,666
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure it's been reported that 90% of the rest of the higher ups also have moved on.

867
01:15:55,166 --> 01:15:57,930
[SPEAKER_02]: So worth considering.

868
01:15:58,430 --> 01:15:58,851
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Loki.

869
01:16:00,922 --> 01:16:01,342
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

870
01:16:02,843 --> 01:16:08,267
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've got some more games coming to Game Pass, and these are Activision games.

871
01:16:09,287 --> 01:16:11,489
[SPEAKER_05]: So Activision games coming.

872
01:16:11,729 --> 01:16:15,291
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got actually some pretty big ones, actually.

873
01:16:15,872 --> 01:16:17,133
[SPEAKER_05]: The Call of Duty games.

874
01:16:18,414 --> 01:16:33,707
[SPEAKER_05]: StarCraft and of course South Park as well we're getting some games there so South Park the Fractured But Whole coming to Game Pass actually already came to Game Pass Donut Country and Ashen those are all out this month

875
01:16:34,608 --> 01:16:40,210
[SPEAKER_05]: and then that's for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, so basically console and PC.

876
01:16:40,951 --> 01:16:49,855
[SPEAKER_05]: On the PC side and Ultimate, we've got MechWarrior 5 Clans, Call of Duty Black Ops 6,

877
01:16:51,075 --> 01:17:13,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Dead Island 2, StarCraft Remastered, and StarCraft 2 Campaign Collection and those are going to be out between now and November 5th and then for Game Pass Ultimate on console only we have Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 on the cloud and then of course Call of Duty Warzone also on the cloud those are both on the 25th

878
01:17:17,285 --> 01:17:18,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots and lots of things.

879
01:17:18,466 --> 01:17:23,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, they need to be adding stuff to Game Pass because they've been taking a lot out of there.

880
01:17:23,049 --> 01:17:24,170
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what else they're taking out?

881
01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:25,231
[SPEAKER_02]: The dollar trial.

882
01:17:25,491 --> 01:17:29,174
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was reported on before, but it's... I think they've done that before, though.

883
01:17:29,434 --> 01:17:38,861
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's going away, so, you know, if you... But, I mean, there's so many ways to, like, get trials of Game Pass, but they are going to make it harder with some of their big, big, big games coming to it.

884
01:17:38,961 --> 01:17:40,322
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, just...

885
01:17:41,022 --> 01:18:08,367
[SPEAKER_02]: just sign up for a month cancel it right away so it doesn't renew and then see if you like it and judge from there that would be what I would suggest if you're trying to test the waters on that alright let's talk about a game that I think would do very well on Game Pass but even without Game Pass I think a lot of people are going to be checking out Hades 2 when it eventually releases but right now it is still in early access and Hades 2 got a big major update this week

886
01:18:08,947 --> 01:18:12,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Supergiant Games is calling this the Olympic update.

887
01:18:13,231 --> 01:18:16,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice little pun intended with what the game is all about.

888
01:18:16,874 --> 01:18:20,798
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a new region with this that will be set, of course, in the mountains of Olympus.

889
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:24,041
[SPEAKER_02]: And new story elements, which means hours of new dialogue.

890
01:18:24,301 --> 01:18:25,962
[SPEAKER_02]: There are also two new allies.

891
01:18:26,523 --> 01:18:30,607
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know who they are, but we did see Ben Starr make a post on...

892
01:18:31,187 --> 01:18:32,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Hades 2 is one of them.

893
01:18:46,964 --> 01:19:05,239
[SPEAKER_02]: There also is going to be a new main weapon, two new animal companions, new cosmetic items, quality of life improvements, and DarkSakura max support natively for Hades 2 Early Access, as long as there is an Apple M1 chip or later required to run the game.

894
01:19:05,259 --> 01:19:05,780
[SPEAKER_01]: As it should be.

895
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:08,002
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so... They're basically new machines.

896
01:19:08,642 --> 01:19:09,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Newer Machines

897
01:19:23,718 --> 01:19:26,560
[SPEAKER_02]: People were, you know, the first Hades did very well.

898
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:29,441
[SPEAKER_02]: This second one, I've played it.

899
01:19:29,561 --> 01:19:30,022
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.

900
01:19:30,102 --> 01:19:31,662
[SPEAKER_02]: If you like the first one, you're going to love this one.

901
01:19:33,143 --> 01:19:37,205
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's going to also do very well when it ultimately finally releases in its final form too.

902
01:19:37,906 --> 01:19:40,227
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe, maybe they're onto something over a super giant.

903
01:19:40,387 --> 01:19:40,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

904
01:19:41,368 --> 01:19:42,949
[SPEAKER_02]: But props to them for that.

905
01:19:43,689 --> 01:19:49,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing this the right way, you know, or I don't know if I should say early access is the right way.

906
01:19:49,553 --> 01:19:53,696
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, if you're going to put a half-baked product out there, then yes, early access is the right way.

907
01:19:54,516 --> 01:19:57,558
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to fully bake it and then release it, just make sure it's fully baked.

908
01:19:59,139 --> 01:20:01,441
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and that Apple logo is on there officially now.

909
01:20:01,681 --> 01:20:01,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

910
01:20:02,722 --> 01:20:03,302
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

911
01:20:03,462 --> 01:20:03,763
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

912
01:20:03,803 --> 01:20:04,043
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.

913
01:20:04,950 --> 01:20:08,694
[SPEAKER_02]: As Joan Hunter-Matt says, the thirst will be real when Ben Starr's character is revealed.

914
01:20:08,834 --> 01:20:13,479
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already been revealed, but I don't know if we know what the name is yet.

915
01:20:13,539 --> 01:20:21,367
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's some concept art and stuff over on The Bad Place where most, to be fair, most celebrities and voice actors are still maintaining a presence, at least for now.

916
01:20:22,878 --> 01:20:24,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, let's move on.

917
01:20:25,301 --> 01:20:32,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, or sorry, no, we're to DarkSakura because, sorry, I think you're actually going to follow up on something we started to get into earlier.

918
01:20:33,131 --> 01:20:35,394
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I said, well, let's hold that thought for a minute.

919
01:20:36,343 --> 01:20:37,963
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's about striking.

920
01:20:39,484 --> 01:20:44,905
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a French Game Workers Union called STJV.

921
01:20:45,145 --> 01:21:01,989
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Syndicat de Travail et Travail de Jeu Video, which just translates to Video Game Workers Union, have stated that they have walked out on a three-day strike.

922
01:21:02,309 --> 01:21:03,449
[SPEAKER_01]: 700 Ubisoft France workers.

923
01:21:04,730 --> 01:21:09,988
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and they said that, you know, they had, uh,

924
01:21:11,647 --> 01:21:19,553
[SPEAKER_01]: called the strike when Ubisoft management did not respond to their complaints that they be in the office at least three days a week.

925
01:21:19,733 --> 01:21:22,275
[SPEAKER_01]: They said that, which is actually kind of funny.

926
01:21:24,957 --> 01:21:26,018
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny on a personal level.

927
01:21:26,038 --> 01:21:26,759
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go to that later.

928
01:21:27,239 --> 01:21:36,466
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, they told the French press that the company had reneged on promises for homeworking

929
01:21:37,767 --> 01:21:41,990
[SPEAKER_01]: and quote, calls into question the way they organize their lives.

930
01:21:42,570 --> 01:21:43,030
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

931
01:21:43,790 --> 01:21:55,577
[SPEAKER_01]: So they thought that, Ubisoft that is, thought that they thought a three-day requirement would boost creativity and teamwork and still respect individual circumstances.

932
01:21:56,337 --> 01:22:17,983
[SPEAKER_01]: sounds a lot like something that my work said um but this was the workers clearly disagreed um and of course you know they're still dealing with uh with the fallout from the the stock drop and everything so now to add to this Ubisoft Milan has joined in for one day um

933
01:22:19,352 --> 01:22:27,275
[SPEAKER_01]: with one of their union leads saying that it is not economically sustainable and it's unfair on a human level.

934
01:22:28,035 --> 01:22:34,177
[SPEAKER_01]: So their branch of Fion's, is it Sigil Union?

935
01:22:35,397 --> 01:22:36,618
[SPEAKER_01]: Also are pretty much...

936
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:41,784
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just read the quote on here to add to that.

937
01:22:41,984 --> 01:22:42,125
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um...

938
01:22:55,512 --> 01:22:59,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they are really pushing for that.

939
01:22:59,797 --> 01:23:04,903
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing, too, is another quote from the STJV group.

940
01:23:05,804 --> 01:23:14,555
[SPEAKER_01]: The consequence of this decision will be the loss of our colleagues' jobs, the disorganization of many game projects, and the drastic increase in psychological risk for those who remain.

941
01:23:17,048 --> 01:23:26,754
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is so much going on, not to mention a class action lawsuit as well for sharing customer data on meta.

942
01:23:28,775 --> 01:23:30,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a new one too.

943
01:23:31,477 --> 01:23:36,300
[SPEAKER_01]: So yay, the lawsuit was filed on October 3rd.

944
01:23:37,581 --> 01:23:41,423
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like the tide against Yves Guillemin, it just gets bigger and bigger.

945
01:23:41,903 --> 01:23:43,524
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sorry, not sorry.

946
01:23:43,564 --> 01:23:44,225
[SPEAKER_02]: You love to see it.

947
01:23:45,751 --> 01:23:46,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah.

948
01:24:15,453 --> 01:24:40,573
[SPEAKER_01]: and there really isn't a comment from Ubisoft yet so we'll see all right stay tuned yep all right now we can go over to Loki for our next story Loki oh SSJ100 Matt says it great when asked for comment Eve Skimmel said wait I'm supposed to care about how my employees feel how does one do that kind of an important part of taking on that role all right Loki what do you have for us

949
01:24:42,176 --> 01:24:47,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Another console that we're probably not going to be able to buy because it'll be sold out, I'm guessing, since it is analog.

950
01:24:47,478 --> 01:24:52,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Analog 3D is a brand new console that they are producing for $250.

951
01:24:52,299 --> 01:24:56,321
[SPEAKER_05]: It is an FPGA Nintendo 64.

952
01:24:57,701 --> 01:25:02,803
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, it has all the bells and whistles that we expect with an analog console.

953
01:25:02,863 --> 01:25:03,643
[SPEAKER_05]: 4K output.

954
01:25:04,103 --> 01:25:06,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Also couldn't do the standard.

955
01:25:07,204 --> 01:25:09,645
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it can also do composite as well.

956
01:25:10,665 --> 01:25:34,732
[SPEAKER_05]: um but yes it's it's got a fancy a wireless controller as well which unfortunately doesn't retain the original look of the um Nintendo 64 but a little bit more like I'd say the GameCube if you know the GameCube were just a ripoff of the Xbox 360 controller but um you know a little bit more modern

957
01:25:35,559 --> 01:25:41,763
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, those are going to be, it's pre-orders are going to be starting tomorrow, October 21st.

958
01:25:41,803 --> 01:25:46,406
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to go faster than Taylor Swift or Beyonce tickets.

959
01:25:46,546 --> 01:25:47,247
[SPEAKER_02]: They will be gone instantly.

960
01:25:47,267 --> 01:25:50,469
[SPEAKER_05]: They are going to start shipping first quarter of 2025.

961
01:25:51,029 --> 01:25:54,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Be available in black or white.

962
01:25:54,292 --> 01:25:58,454
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that's just going to be not available because good luck.

963
01:25:58,654 --> 01:26:00,115
[SPEAKER_02]: May the odds be ever in your favor.

964
01:26:01,376 --> 01:26:01,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm hmm.

965
01:26:02,037 --> 01:26:02,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm hmm.

966
01:26:03,852 --> 01:26:04,112
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

967
01:26:04,132 --> 01:26:08,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think it's neat, though, that we're starting to see the hardware for this stuff pop up.

968
01:26:08,394 --> 01:26:11,975
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure Analog is not going to be the only one that puts out something in 64.

969
01:26:12,655 --> 01:26:15,676
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll kind of start to see more as the hardware patents expire.

970
01:26:15,696 --> 01:26:18,377
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to see more companies kind of doing their own versions of this.

971
01:26:18,417 --> 01:26:24,719
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll be interesting to see what all comes out with that for people that love to enjoy retro stuff like me.

972
01:26:26,841 --> 01:26:31,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, speaking of retro things, and unfortunately this is a little bit of sad news.

973
01:26:31,423 --> 01:26:36,585
[SPEAKER_02]: We kind of knew it was coming, but it's still a little sad to hear it as definitively as this.

974
01:26:37,126 --> 01:26:44,709
[SPEAKER_02]: But Nobuo Uematsu has announced that he is retiring from composing video game music as in he's done.

975
01:26:44,829 --> 01:26:49,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Fantasian Neo Dimension is his final project.

976
01:26:49,251 --> 01:26:49,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Done, done, done.

977
01:26:50,271 --> 01:26:51,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, it was...

978
01:26:52,132 --> 01:26:56,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Later clarified and amended to basically be on social media.

979
01:26:56,898 --> 01:27:03,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Uematsu went and actually said, not like retiring completely, but I will not be doing any more full soundtracks.

980
01:27:03,546 --> 01:27:09,453
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, I'm going to cut back a bit on my video game music work because I want to have more time to make the music I want to make.

981
01:27:10,054 --> 01:27:38,861
[SPEAKER_02]: it would be difficult for me to take on the entire soundtrack of a video game because the time commitment for composing would be too long but I would like to continue work on jobs such as one theme song so I kind of take that to mean he'll probably still contribute to future Final Fantasy games whether they be 14 expansions or the inevitable Final Fantasy 17 whenever they're ready to reveal that I would assume he will still be working on those and perhaps other role playing games where he'll contribute one song but he's done

982
01:27:39,381 --> 01:28:07,571
[SPEAKER_02]: and honestly when you think about everything the man's given to our childhoods and the games we love and enjoy let the man enjoy his fucking retirement yes yes it's sad news but he earned it let him enjoy his I don't think it's sad I'm happy for him he's leaving us with a wonderful body of work and he gets to chill that's right well and I thought what was actually the most and I don't know if this is a translation issue or what so I'm trying not to read too much into this but he says I'm gonna cut back on my video game work because I want to have more time to make the music I want to make

983
01:28:08,231 --> 01:28:28,096
[SPEAKER_02]: and so I wonder if he isn't expanding and he's going to make like an album that just has nothing to do with games that's like whether it's a pop album or a classic album he's going solo Rob yeah I mean like he's just making a different it sounds like he might release a CD of some sort that is music or he's just making music to make music

984
01:28:28,816 --> 01:28:39,004
[SPEAKER_01]: or maybe he's going to make music that nobody's ever going to hear I make a bunch of music that no one ever hears and I have no intention of putting out an album or anything it's just fun to make music

985
01:28:40,554 --> 01:28:42,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I am working on something for us.

986
01:28:42,476 --> 01:28:44,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby Blackwell says metal album.

987
01:28:44,198 --> 01:28:44,899
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a metalhead.

988
01:28:44,979 --> 01:28:46,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you never know.

989
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:47,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Garth Brooks did that rock album.

990
01:28:48,202 --> 01:28:51,746
[SPEAKER_02]: There's that whole thing about Mariah Carey apparently had a Grunge Girl album in the 90s.

991
01:28:51,786 --> 01:28:52,607
[SPEAKER_02]: It was never released.

992
01:28:53,087 --> 01:28:56,010
[SPEAKER_02]: So you never know.

993
01:28:56,190 --> 01:28:57,251
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know what will happen.

994
01:28:57,852 --> 01:28:58,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you know what?

995
01:28:59,093 --> 01:29:01,335
[SPEAKER_02]: D'Artagnan says he was part of the Black Mages.

996
01:29:02,156 --> 01:29:02,877
[SPEAKER_02]: That was that.

997
01:29:03,217 --> 01:29:04,858
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, you're right.

998
01:29:05,078 --> 01:29:06,619
[SPEAKER_02]: He really is maybe a metal guy.

999
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:08,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe he's going to make something like that.

1000
01:29:08,060 --> 01:29:08,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

1001
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:08,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

1002
01:29:09,881 --> 01:29:13,303
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, he doesn't owe you anything at the end of the day.

1003
01:29:14,344 --> 01:29:17,025
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll wish him a happy retirement and have that be that.

1004
01:29:17,305 --> 01:29:21,968
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, Fantasian, the new one coming out to a lot more consoles.

1005
01:29:22,649 --> 01:29:27,752
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm assuming they have changed the touch mechanic to something a little different to make that work.

1006
01:29:28,112 --> 01:29:29,813
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm excited to check it out.

1007
01:29:30,934 --> 01:29:31,154
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1008
01:29:31,912 --> 01:29:37,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess this makes a good segue to talking about our classic game of the week.

1009
01:29:37,446 --> 01:29:38,388
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's roll the bumper.

1010
01:29:49,235 --> 01:29:56,523
[SPEAKER_00]: and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1011
01:29:56,984 --> 01:29:59,606
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

1012
01:30:00,447 --> 01:30:01,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a classic though?

1013
01:30:02,510 --> 01:30:03,551
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura?

1014
01:30:04,131 --> 01:30:06,093
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a game that people should be aware of.

1015
01:30:06,214 --> 01:30:07,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, alright.

1016
01:30:07,275 --> 01:30:08,256
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the classic of the week?

1017
01:30:08,715 --> 01:30:14,639
[SPEAKER_01]: For the record, the Mariah Carey album was one she sung backup on and it was by a band called Chick and called Someone's Ugly Daughter.

1018
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:17,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I knew it existed, but anyway.

1019
01:30:18,162 --> 01:30:21,044
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the copies that exists out there is selling for $300.

1020
01:30:22,285 --> 01:30:22,605
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

1021
01:30:23,486 --> 01:30:25,267
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because I looked this shit up.

1022
01:30:25,788 --> 01:30:34,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, the game is called Superman The New Superman Adventures or as we all know it, Superman 64.

1023
01:30:37,016 --> 01:30:37,937
[SPEAKER_01]: Hot garbage, right?

1024
01:30:38,723 --> 01:30:39,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

1025
01:30:40,044 --> 01:30:56,633
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's worth saying something about because this game has been so ingrained as what a bad game is that it had to eventually show up on the list, right?

1026
01:30:56,653 --> 01:30:56,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1027
01:30:57,739 --> 01:31:06,483
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, it's an action-adventure game that was published by Titus Interactive for Nintendo 64 that was based off of the Superman the Animated Series.

1028
01:31:07,804 --> 01:31:11,346
[SPEAKER_01]: It was released in North America on May 29, 1999, in Europe on July 23, and is the first 3D Superman game.

1029
01:31:11,386 --> 01:31:11,486
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

1030
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:46,028
[SPEAKER_01]: it is a game where everyone is trapped in this virtual environment and Superman has to go rescue his people so yeah it's got all kinds of the classic bad guys in it I'm not going to go into that but there was a lot of issues with its development a lot of restrictions being put on the developer and just DC and Warner Brothers having

1031
01:31:47,674 --> 01:31:48,616
[SPEAKER_01]: having some crap.

1032
01:31:48,676 --> 01:31:52,182
[SPEAKER_01]: And also an attempted remake of it to make it better.

1033
01:31:53,004 --> 01:31:55,909
[SPEAKER_01]: So... Anyway...

1034
01:31:58,223 --> 01:32:23,759
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to go and do these different tasks and go through puzzles and he can walk and fly and punch and do all of this stuff but apparently his powers are supposed to be super diminished in this world I'll get into that later so there are if you attack a civilian character or do uh

1035
01:32:24,942 --> 01:32:29,524
[SPEAKER_01]: You lose all your health points or different things go on.

1036
01:32:29,564 --> 01:32:32,826
[SPEAKER_01]: You can lose a level and it just says Lex wins.

1037
01:32:34,407 --> 01:32:37,288
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are 14 levels with outdoor and indoor environments.

1038
01:32:37,408 --> 01:32:40,530
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got combat and exploration, battling villains.

1039
01:32:41,850 --> 01:32:45,172
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got three difficulty levels, easy, normal, and Superman.

1040
01:32:45,812 --> 01:32:50,475
[SPEAKER_01]: So in easy mode, you don't need to fly through rings during ride stages.

1041
01:32:51,155 --> 01:33:11,982
[SPEAKER_01]: apparently there's some stuff of that but there's also multiplayer modes where there's a racing mode and a battle mode that can play up to four people and you have to defeat your opponents by throwing weapons and items at them and then in racing modes you control a spaceship while rings are shot at your opponents

1042
01:33:12,921 --> 01:33:31,031
[SPEAKER_01]: so yeah not great anyway um so Eric Kane who is one of the founders of Titus Interactive uh got the rights uh from Warner Brothers licensing to do a Superman game during the animated series era and so um when uh

1043
01:33:32,586 --> 01:33:37,368
[SPEAKER_01]: When he learned about it, he got the license and no other company was really into it.

1044
01:33:38,168 --> 01:33:45,172
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said that Warner Brothers asked him three times if he was sure of what he was doing.

1045
01:33:45,572 --> 01:33:52,675
[SPEAKER_01]: So he signed a license deal in 97 with Warner Brothers to develop the game, to do it for Nintendo 64, PlayStation, and Game Boy.

1046
01:33:54,330 --> 01:33:59,114
[SPEAKER_01]: and each port consisted of two programmers and six to nine artists.

1047
01:34:00,135 --> 01:34:03,938
[SPEAKER_01]: The Game Boy version was completed and released by the end of that year.

1048
01:34:04,638 --> 01:34:08,361
[SPEAKER_01]: The Nintendo 64 version development lasted for two years.

1049
01:34:08,522 --> 01:34:10,643
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted it to be more like a

1050
01:34:11,664 --> 01:34:19,806
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomb Raider, 3D open world type of thing, real-time strategy, and behave like a superhero.

1051
01:34:19,906 --> 01:34:29,208
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, and this is a quote, it would stretch the Nintendo 64 to its limits, feature Superman's ability to fly and fight and include all of the superpowers.

1052
01:34:29,288 --> 01:34:30,649
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was a little bit too ambitious.

1053
01:34:31,609 --> 01:34:35,910
[SPEAKER_01]: So only about 10% of the original design made it into the final game.

1054
01:34:37,491 --> 01:34:58,593
[SPEAKER_01]: and then after the deal was finalized where the Warner Brothers licensing went through a bit of a change the group turned on Titus in the project and tried to halt its development so they wanted to turn it into a SimCity style game where he acts as the Superman acts as the mayor and yeah and

1055
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:15,155
[SPEAKER_01]: and basically there's just a lot of back and forth and wanting to make changes and then finally there were some changes that was made so that the character would be portrayed positively

1056
01:35:16,178 --> 01:35:19,520
[SPEAKER_01]: by limiting his power and removing destructible architecture.

1057
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:24,844
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's why they put it in the virtual world to prevent from harming, quote, real people.

1058
01:35:26,025 --> 01:35:30,708
[SPEAKER_01]: The rings were meant to be tutorials, but they ended up being a permanent part of the game.

1059
01:35:32,449 --> 01:35:36,391
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just taking months and months to get characters approved.

1060
01:35:37,652 --> 01:35:44,136
[SPEAKER_01]: Not being able to address bugs because they really couldn't test anything because they didn't have characters

1061
01:35:47,639 --> 01:36:12,277
[SPEAKER_01]: they couldn't actually get characters approved so they couldn't incorporate more of the work into it so it was showcased at E3 in 97, 98 and 99 and there were even then publications were calling it Superman 64 since 1997's coverage they didn't really talk about the virtual world in there they

1062
01:36:13,258 --> 01:36:23,713
[SPEAKER_01]: were going into a few misrepresenting what the story was, highlighting powers that really were more of a minor.

1063
01:36:24,615 --> 01:36:27,519
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people were saying that the game looked...

1064
01:36:29,163 --> 01:36:43,159
[SPEAKER_01]: for a fan the game looked great but for anybody else the game looked really bad some people said that the 3D environments were stunning and the fight levels were great but it got delayed after 1997

1065
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:53,303
[SPEAKER_01]: In March 98, it was about 85-95% complete, but there were further delays after criticism at E3.

1066
01:36:55,223 --> 01:37:05,226
[SPEAKER_01]: On August 24, the character models and map sheets were released, and GamePro said that it was a showstopper and looked good.

1067
01:37:06,209 --> 01:37:17,673
[SPEAKER_01]: but keep going further you know there was a lot of enthusiasm for the game they really just tried to put out like the best there was of it and it was even some people said it would elevate the Nintendo 64 even more

1068
01:37:21,145 --> 01:37:37,222
[SPEAKER_01]: um but now if we fast forward quite a bit we have a scheduled release for November 16th 1988 that was announced in a press release with a huge promotional campaign and it was one of only five Nintendo 64 games shown at the 1999 Tokyo Game Show but um

1069
01:37:42,543 --> 01:37:43,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, failure.

1070
01:37:43,784 --> 01:37:44,144
[SPEAKER_01]: It failed.

1071
01:37:44,605 --> 01:37:45,225
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not good.

1072
01:37:45,426 --> 01:37:46,086
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not great.

1073
01:37:46,326 --> 01:37:49,169
[SPEAKER_01]: It had lots of bad stuff going on.

1074
01:37:49,289 --> 01:37:59,498
[SPEAKER_01]: However, Titus did entrust Blue Sky Software to redesign the game for the PlayStation, and the game did get approval from Sony, but the Warner Bros.

1075
01:37:59,538 --> 01:38:04,262
[SPEAKER_01]: license expired, and Titus couldn't get a new one, so the game was canceled in 2000.

1076
01:38:05,403 --> 01:38:09,626
[SPEAKER_01]: So that basically, because of Warner Bros., the PlayStation version was killed.

1077
01:38:10,984 --> 01:38:34,735
[SPEAKER_01]: however there was a game build that was dated June 22nd 2000 that did eventually get linked to MediaFire and there's also apparently still out there archived on Internet Archive so there you go maybe you can find it so anyway

1078
01:38:36,716 --> 01:38:46,565
[SPEAKER_01]: it was a top seller in America the week of June 1999 in July of the same year it had become the third best-selling game from Nintendo 64 over 500,000 units were sold but

1079
01:38:52,363 --> 01:38:57,589
[SPEAKER_01]: People were giving it some good feedback, but they were the target audience.

1080
01:38:58,490 --> 01:39:06,538
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the contemporary critical reception of it, it was considered to be one of the worst games of all times.

1081
01:39:08,239 --> 01:39:15,526
[SPEAKER_01]: In IGN, it was published that the game was executed so poorly that it would harm the character's reputation.

1082
01:39:16,607 --> 01:39:20,070
[SPEAKER_01]: and that it had a rushed, careless feel to the game.

1083
01:39:21,991 --> 01:39:25,213
[SPEAKER_01]: The controls were confusing and difficult to use.

1084
01:39:25,513 --> 01:39:28,635
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just really not great.

1085
01:39:28,655 --> 01:39:30,737
[SPEAKER_01]: There were foggy, empty levels.

1086
01:39:31,297 --> 01:39:33,118
[SPEAKER_01]: The indoor levels seemed out of place.

1087
01:39:34,079 --> 01:39:38,822
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking like Next Generation gave it a 1 out of 5 stars as did Allgame.

1088
01:39:38,922 --> 01:39:40,643
[SPEAKER_01]: EGM gave it an 8 out of 40.

1089
01:39:41,824 --> 01:39:42,685
[SPEAKER_01]: It was 23% in game rankings.

1090
01:39:46,487 --> 01:40:09,412
[SPEAKER_01]: N64 Magazine gave it a 14% uh yeah it just it was abysmal abysmal IGN gave it a 3.4 out of 10 so GameSpot 1.3 out of 10 Game Revolution gave it an F Game Informer 1.25 out of 10 so yeah it was panned this is not great

1091
01:40:10,618 --> 01:40:19,499
[SPEAKER_01]: and so but I think it is oh also it tells a Guinness World Record for lowest rated superhero game of all time

1092
01:40:20,506 --> 01:40:21,267
[SPEAKER_02]: How about that?

1093
01:40:21,307 --> 01:40:22,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that in the 2025 edition, maybe?

1094
01:40:24,929 --> 01:40:26,010
[SPEAKER_02]: This is 2017.

1095
01:40:28,011 --> 01:40:41,101
[SPEAKER_01]: But at any rate, though, I think that this is another example of how other factors can go into the destruction of what could have been a decent game.

1096
01:40:41,241 --> 01:40:47,926
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a lot of plans for it, but I think it's something that would have been worth holding off for a later-gen console.

1097
01:40:49,526 --> 01:41:17,675
[SPEAKER_01]: and and maybe not doing it just because you had access to the franchise you know but Warner Brothers I think had a lot to do with its failure and I think that not all of the the blame needs to be put on Titus I think that it was a bunch of stuff that went on behind the backs of people that no one really knew about at the time and yeah that's the game

1098
01:41:18,871 --> 01:41:46,305
[SPEAKER_01]: that is a game and I mean and you can see where like there could have been potential it could have been good you know but I understand that what those limitations probably did I mean I think also again it was really ambitious for what it was this is not the kind of game that would easily work on Nintendo 64 and that's it

1099
01:41:49,664 --> 01:41:52,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it kind of reminds me in some ways of E.T., how like if E.T.

1100
01:41:52,787 --> 01:41:56,209
[SPEAKER_02]: had had more time to bake, there's actually a good game in there, right?

1101
01:41:56,289 --> 01:41:57,450
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just the nature of the rest production.

1102
01:41:57,470 --> 01:41:57,710
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but E.T.

1103
01:41:57,730 --> 01:41:58,170
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't have...

1104
01:41:59,161 --> 01:42:01,942
[SPEAKER_01]: The License Holder, like, working against the developer.

1105
01:42:01,962 --> 01:42:02,843
[SPEAKER_02]: True, true, true.

1106
01:42:02,943 --> 01:42:04,624
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a different scenario, but I don't know why.

1107
01:42:04,664 --> 01:42:08,646
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of like, I guess it's the whole, like, there's a good game in there somewhere element of it, you know?

1108
01:42:09,406 --> 01:42:11,907
[SPEAKER_02]: So, all right, well, there it is, your classic?

1109
01:42:12,428 --> 01:42:14,849
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it is a classic, but just- It's a classic.

1110
01:42:14,869 --> 01:42:18,431
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a classic for different reasons than most classics here.

1111
01:42:18,531 --> 01:42:20,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Superman64.

1112
01:42:21,052 --> 01:42:24,974
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw in chat asks, do you think we need a new Superman game?

1113
01:42:24,994 --> 01:42:26,354
[SPEAKER_02]: The last one was on the Xbox 360.

1114
01:42:26,394 --> 01:42:26,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1115
01:42:28,125 --> 01:42:28,766
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to know what?

1116
01:42:29,326 --> 01:42:30,967
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't give two shits about Superman.

1117
01:42:32,449 --> 01:42:34,670
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a good game is a good game.

1118
01:42:35,111 --> 01:42:36,612
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a DC fan.

1119
01:42:36,812 --> 01:42:49,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, whether it's Superman or a legally distinct super person with a cape flying around, you know, type of thing, a good game is a good game.

1120
01:42:49,942 --> 01:42:53,044
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need it to be Superman as much as I need it to be good.

1121
01:42:53,785 --> 01:42:56,467
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is better served in the Injustice games.

1122
01:42:57,762 --> 01:43:13,511
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah Injustice was kind of a fun series so I thought they were I liked the comics for Injustice those were pretty good yeah all right well let's continue on and talk about some other headlines quickly in a segment we call Rapid Fire News Loki what do you got for us

1123
01:43:14,695 --> 01:43:24,138
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got some other superhero news talking about Spider-Man 2 coming to the PC very soon.

1124
01:43:24,199 --> 01:43:32,822
[SPEAKER_05]: So January 2025 is coming to PC, and it will require a PlayStation Network login.

1125
01:43:33,622 --> 01:43:35,903
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like they don't learn, do they?

1126
01:43:35,923 --> 01:43:36,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1127
01:43:37,850 --> 01:43:48,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and rather quickly too, considering that the original game came out just 15 months ago, or 15 months from when it will be released on PC.

1128
01:43:49,579 --> 01:43:56,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Along with that, Insomniac has confirmed that no plans for story DLC for the game as well.

1129
01:43:57,306 --> 01:44:04,251
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you were expecting some expansion to the story, nah, they're working on Wolverine, so sorry.

1130
01:44:06,073 --> 01:44:06,213
[SPEAKER_05]: And,

1131
01:44:07,190 --> 01:44:12,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Out of nowhere, exciting news, a brand new Tron game, Tron Catalyst.

1132
01:44:12,872 --> 01:44:25,515
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an isometric action game that was being shown by Devolver Digital's big fan games publishing label and looks pretty cool, actually.

1133
01:44:26,895 --> 01:44:36,498
[SPEAKER_05]: It's apparently continuing the story of Arc Grid, which was introduced in the visual novel game Tron Identity.

1134
01:44:37,930 --> 01:44:40,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Which I did not play, but it looks cool.

1135
01:44:41,311 --> 01:44:46,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the gaming, the kind of like action-y sequences in this game do look kind of interesting.

1136
01:44:47,713 --> 01:44:48,594
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of down.

1137
01:44:48,734 --> 01:44:53,295
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not what I expected a Tron game to look like, but I'm kind of into it.

1138
01:44:53,375 --> 01:44:54,015
[SPEAKER_02]: I could be into it.

1139
01:44:54,696 --> 01:44:58,517
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do love me some Tron, as you see behind me every week when I do this show.

1140
01:44:58,637 --> 01:45:02,978
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm very worried about this upcoming movie, but I'm going to try.

1141
01:45:03,539 --> 01:45:05,859
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go in with an open mind.

1142
01:45:06,019 --> 01:45:06,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I am.

1143
01:45:07,797 --> 01:45:08,478
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try.

1144
01:45:09,538 --> 01:45:09,799
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1145
01:45:09,819 --> 01:45:10,559
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see how that goes.

1146
01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:11,680
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1147
01:45:13,161 --> 01:45:13,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on.

1148
01:45:13,721 --> 01:45:14,202
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.

1149
01:45:15,583 --> 01:45:21,327
[SPEAKER_01]: So Gamestone Quick has raised over $45,000 for hurricane relief.

1150
01:45:22,207 --> 01:45:25,930
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is wonderful and heartwarming.

1151
01:45:25,990 --> 01:45:28,592
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to go directly to the disaster relief charity.

1152
01:45:31,189 --> 01:45:59,653
[SPEAKER_02]: that is great I actually I did get to see one of the speedruns from this in full one of my friends loves GDQ and speedruns and always wants to like when we hang out wants to watch a speedrun or two which is fine we watched the one for the Nintendo World Championships game where the speedrunner they were playing all of the little mini games back to back to back to back and it took them about an hour and 15 minutes I think the part time was an hour and a half it took about an hour and 15 minutes to get through the whole thing

1153
01:45:59,753 --> 01:46:01,494
[SPEAKER_01]: Skybills, according to Bobby.

1154
01:46:29,629 --> 01:46:54,111
[SPEAKER_02]: which actually gives you more air and gets you further in that direction you have to do a dance between forward and backwards with the tilting to do better and I was like oh I just want to like but I don't want to be that guy like I want to send him a message and be like you can improve your excite bike times if you tilt forward as well as backwards but it's like don't be that guy don't be that guy oh I'm not so instead I'm saying it on my podcast where it'll never be heard by anyone

1155
01:46:55,106 --> 01:47:23,658
[SPEAKER_02]: but Excitebike is a hard game and you know what, so is Ice Climber and to be able to clear some of those tasks in time is a very, very tricky skill so there's that alright anyway let's move on, we'll travel oh wait, no, just kidding I have the story to talk about this is interesting, now I don't y'all know how I feel about Kickstarters I don't like to talk about Kickstarters unless there's like a final project that is ready

1156
01:47:24,218 --> 01:47:25,278
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's a little different.

1157
01:47:25,358 --> 01:47:28,439
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to roll with it because they've already met their goal, which is nice.

1158
01:47:28,839 --> 01:47:32,441
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of our listeners have been talking about it, which tells me I should talk about it here.

1159
01:47:33,061 --> 01:47:37,562
[SPEAKER_02]: And the original media holder is actually wanting to see this happen.

1160
01:47:37,622 --> 01:47:43,264
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is EGM Media, who own the magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly and its entire archive.

1161
01:47:43,664 --> 01:47:49,966
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be doing a book and digital archive project to honor the legacy of this print publication.

1162
01:47:51,046 --> 01:47:52,067
[SPEAKER_02]: So they are...

1163
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:54,881
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1164
01:48:13,078 --> 01:48:14,339
[SPEAKER_02]: and the legacy of the magazine.

1165
01:48:14,419 --> 01:48:15,981
[SPEAKER_02]: It will also have long form articles.

1166
01:48:16,561 --> 01:48:17,922
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to get it digitally, it's $15.

1167
01:48:18,042 --> 01:48:20,425
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to get a hardcover version, it's going to be $50.

1168
01:48:22,046 --> 01:48:26,530
[SPEAKER_02]: There are also some other tiers that can get you additional things, which is kind of neat.

1169
01:48:27,230 --> 01:48:31,054
[SPEAKER_02]: It did meet its goal already, and they're looking to have that delivered by February 2025.

1170
01:48:31,114 --> 01:48:33,316
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sure there's people that are going to be all over that.

1171
01:48:33,496 --> 01:48:35,958
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, you know, again,

1172
01:48:37,796 --> 01:48:38,797
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1173
01:48:52,816 --> 01:48:53,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it helps.

1174
01:48:53,897 --> 01:48:56,878
[SPEAKER_02]: The Guinness book feels like a magazine in many ways.

1175
01:48:56,918 --> 01:48:57,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it kind of does.

1176
01:48:57,539 --> 01:48:59,740
[SPEAKER_02]: It really has that magazine look and feel.

1177
01:48:59,780 --> 01:49:03,782
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if that's just trying to get a younger audience or whatever because it is about games.

1178
01:49:04,302 --> 01:49:07,924
[SPEAKER_02]: But I liked the Guinness book because it feels like a magazine.

1179
01:49:08,324 --> 01:49:19,651
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I feel like, all right, if you want to show folks that there still is a demand there for print media from some of the people who really brought it to us for years and years, then maybe I ought to just shut up and back this thing, which I think I'm going to do, honestly.

1180
01:49:19,811 --> 01:49:21,552
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't mind the book, to be quite honest.

1181
01:49:21,592 --> 01:49:22,212
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm going to do that.

1182
01:49:22,372 --> 01:49:25,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Too bad they couldn't have done this with Game Informer.

1183
01:49:26,897 --> 01:49:29,099
[SPEAKER_02]: They took the archives and they're like, bye-bye.

1184
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:38,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and maybe we should show them it was a mistake, but not that I really want GameStop to... I don't know that I would have backed it if it was GameStop doing it.

1185
01:49:38,870 --> 01:49:42,533
[SPEAKER_02]: If GameStop sold the rights to somebody else and they were doing it,

1186
01:49:43,359 --> 01:49:44,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'd feel differently.

1187
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:49,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially if that person was an employee of the magazine at one point.

1188
01:49:49,702 --> 01:49:51,944
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why there's a lot of things about this that I like.

1189
01:49:52,144 --> 01:49:53,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Original creator is involved.

1190
01:49:55,025 --> 01:49:58,908
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people that were involved are backing it, which I think is really neat.

1191
01:49:59,088 --> 01:50:00,889
[SPEAKER_02]: So sure, why not?

1192
01:50:00,989 --> 01:50:01,469
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll back it.

1193
01:50:02,309 --> 01:50:08,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some things you can back off the retail or digital shelf very soon.

1194
01:50:09,690 --> 01:50:11,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to Loki in the US.

1195
01:50:11,331 --> 01:50:12,072
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot.

1196
01:50:12,892 --> 01:50:15,994
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot, because, you know, fourth quarter and all.

1197
01:50:16,835 --> 01:50:20,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Amanda, The Adventurer 2 on PC.

1198
01:50:21,317 --> 01:50:24,880
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Awaken Astral Blade on PC and PlayStation 5.

1199
01:50:24,980 --> 01:50:30,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Fey Farm on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

1200
01:50:32,304 --> 01:50:41,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Fear the Spotlight on PC, Mac, and Linux, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

1201
01:50:42,108 --> 01:50:45,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Kong Survivor Instinct.

[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that the one, the big flop that's been being worked on for, I don't know, I guess it wouldn't be a flop unless it's already been, I thought there was a King Kong game recently that like looked horrific.

1205
01:51:02,842 --> 01:51:15,400
[SPEAKER_02]: uh no not that one i don't i don't think it was that one um maybe just we need to stop using kong unless it is sandwiched by the words donkey country i think we need to start from the word kong

1261
01:59:49,300 --> 01:59:51,181
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, we have a headline from Loki.

1262
01:59:53,021 --> 01:59:56,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so apparently Tekken 8 had a...

1263
01:59:58,864 --> 02:00:26,423
[SPEAKER_05]: a level that was supposed to be included in the $110 deluxe version of the game but it wasn't included in that instead the level was going to be sold for an additional $5 and so of course the community took that with you know they took it very well they praised you know Namco and Namco Bandai for you know

1264
02:00:27,506 --> 02:00:28,692
[SPEAKER_05]: being strong and innovative.

1265
02:00:28,793 --> 02:00:29,376
[SPEAKER_05]: No, of course not.

1266
02:00:29,436 --> 02:00:29,577
[SPEAKER_05]: They...

1267
02:00:32,213 --> 02:00:33,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Review Bomb the hell out of the game.

1268
02:00:34,454 --> 02:00:45,258
[SPEAKER_05]: And as such, Bandai Namco has walked back the whole DLC and gave the players $5 worth of free Tekken coins.

1269
02:00:46,559 --> 02:00:57,323
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, we apologize for not meeting the community's expectation for the playable character Year One Pass and the Gemaji Temple DLC release method.

1270
02:00:58,722 --> 02:01:07,704
[SPEAKER_05]: After some thorough discussion, the feedback, the tech and project team has decided on the following measures and they released all that stuff.

1271
02:01:08,085 --> 02:01:22,468
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, it says that the playable character, a year one pass edition says that it will, pass owners will now have access to it instead of having to pay an additional $5 on top of the year one pass.

1272
02:01:23,088 --> 02:01:24,529
[SPEAKER_05]: And on top of that, they're also going to give you $5

1273
02:01:26,277 --> 02:01:45,622
[SPEAKER_05]: dollars in coins you know so that you have to buy more coins in order to get more things I'm sure so good on them but once again this goes back to the original discussion that we had with monetization in games and how it kind of ruins it yep yeah there you go

1274
02:01:47,912 --> 02:02:00,054
[SPEAKER_05]: they weren't content on having a season pass they had to sell additional things on top of that stuff that would normally be included in the regular game this is what you get

1275
02:02:02,110 --> 02:02:02,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Discord Discord.com

1276
02:02:24,130 --> 02:02:25,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Discord, Final Fantasy XI

1277
02:02:37,789 --> 02:03:00,418
[SPEAKER_02]: This and an interview with Famitsu where Discord creator Stanislav Vinshevisky I hope I said that right Discussed the origins of the platform saying that he played a lot of Final Fantasy XI And actually made a prototype to use while playing And I remember when Loki and I would play Final Fantasy XI I think Jamie did for a little bit too We were using Ventrilo to talk to each other, right?

1278
02:03:00,438 --> 02:03:04,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there were these pay services you could use to talk to each other They were, you know

1279
02:03:05,427 --> 02:03:07,148
[SPEAKER_02]: They worked at the time, but you had to pay for them.

1280
02:03:07,589 --> 02:03:09,310
[SPEAKER_02]: People didn't really like that either.

1281
02:03:11,531 --> 02:03:16,955
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, then he developed a prototype to Discord so that he and his friends could talk.

1282
02:03:17,416 --> 02:03:28,544
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when he moved to California and joined GREE, the mobile game developer, he met Jason Citron and they actually fleshed out what Discord eventually became.

1283
02:03:29,845 --> 02:03:37,691
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, throughout the interview, it was asked, why do you think that Discord is successful when Skype was already a thing at the time for voice chat?

1284
02:03:37,751 --> 02:03:42,414
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of us laugh at Skype now, but again, way back in the history of this show, we took calls via Skype.

1285
02:03:43,275 --> 02:03:46,337
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, you know, before Skype just became basically what's Microsoft Teams today.

1286
02:03:47,358 --> 02:03:50,140
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we used to take calls on Skype and a lot of people use Skype to talk.

1287
02:03:52,915 --> 02:03:57,738
[SPEAKER_02]: The creator said that it's probably the simplicity of Discord that made it so popular.

1288
02:03:58,078 --> 02:04:02,141
[SPEAKER_02]: The vision was a, quote, living room where you can spend time with your friends.

1289
02:04:02,641 --> 02:04:05,183
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what made Discord so special.

1290
02:04:05,963 --> 02:04:13,708
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you are wondering, yes, Stanislav now plays Final Fantasy XIV and is currently underway playing Dawn Trail.

1291
02:04:15,868 --> 02:04:19,114
[SPEAKER_02]: and probably using Discord to talk to his friends while he plays.

1292
02:04:19,434 --> 02:04:21,338
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is just a lucky guess.

1293
02:04:21,979 --> 02:04:22,099
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

1294
02:04:23,497 --> 02:04:25,117
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S says, still use Skype.

1295
02:04:25,298 --> 02:04:27,298
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought Skype got folded into Microsoft Teams.

1296
02:04:27,358 --> 02:04:28,518
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that it was still a thing.

1297
02:04:28,538 --> 02:04:29,119
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of cool.

1298
02:04:29,879 --> 02:04:31,739
[SPEAKER_02]: I never did enjoy Skype.

1299
02:04:31,759 --> 02:04:34,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XI is still going on.

1300
02:04:34,360 --> 02:04:34,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is.

1301
02:04:34,940 --> 02:04:35,700
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like private.

1302
02:04:36,020 --> 02:04:49,984
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I found out through retro achievements about a big one called Horizon because somebody patched achievements into Final Fantasy XI, which you have to be playing on this Horizon server, which is the old Final Fantasy XIV, or excuse me, Final Fantasy XI.

1303
02:04:50,584 --> 02:05:11,853
[SPEAKER_02]: meaning the cap is 75 there's no books so you have to party in Valkyrim Dunes it's the old school uh but I think that's because they stopped developing for the PlayStation 2 when all that extra shit came out so this is kind of frozen with the Chains of Barathea expansion because all the other stuff was after they stopped PS2 development so kind of interesting

1304
02:05:13,783 --> 02:05:17,244
[SPEAKER_02]: but that is not one I'll be probably playing live anytime soon but also never say never.

1305
02:05:17,684 --> 02:05:18,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Never say never.

1306
02:05:18,524 --> 02:05:19,745
[SPEAKER_02]: I do miss 11 some days.

1307
02:05:19,965 --> 02:05:20,545
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good times.

1308
02:05:22,025 --> 02:05:26,687
[SPEAKER_02]: And DJ Ranma S says Skype for business that was rebranded into Microsoft Teams.

1309
02:05:27,067 --> 02:05:27,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.

1310
02:05:28,787 --> 02:05:29,087
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1311
02:05:30,648 --> 02:05:33,649
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it for our stories but we welcome your calls.

1312
02:05:33,769 --> 02:05:36,569
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to join our Discord server in the green room we can take calls.

1313
02:05:37,470 --> 02:05:39,590
[SPEAKER_02]: We would usually go to the mailbag at this point.

1314
02:05:39,630 --> 02:05:41,391
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there was anything in there, right?

1315
02:05:41,991 --> 02:05:42,231
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1316
02:05:42,351 --> 02:05:42,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1317
02:05:43,052 --> 02:05:49,237
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you want to send something in the mailbag, participate at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to email us.

1318
02:05:49,458 --> 02:05:56,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I've decided during the show, and I hope my co-hosts will support me, I think we need to make an OLR account on Blue Sky.

1319
02:05:57,184 --> 02:06:01,828
[SPEAKER_02]: If everybody is making their way to Blue Sky, people have a way to interact with us on Blue Sky.

1320
02:06:01,868 --> 02:06:02,349
[SPEAKER_02]: What do y'all think?

1321
02:06:02,509 --> 02:06:02,809
[SPEAKER_01]: I could've!

1322
02:06:02,829 --> 02:06:03,110
[SPEAKER_01]: I could've!

1323
02:06:22,887 --> 02:06:24,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so we'll get on that.

1324
02:06:24,848 --> 02:06:26,989
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll figure out how to do the domain verification.

1325
02:06:27,029 --> 02:06:29,851
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to look that up when somebody else was talking.

1326
02:06:29,911 --> 02:06:32,933
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't look, it looks, it looks simple enough that even I can do it.

1327
02:06:33,453 --> 02:06:36,595
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm hoping we will just be orange laundry.com on blue sky.

1328
02:06:37,235 --> 02:06:38,276
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

1329
02:06:39,520 --> 02:06:39,800
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not.

1330
02:06:39,820 --> 02:06:40,760
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1331
02:07:09,311 --> 02:07:17,895
[SPEAKER_02]: SG100 Matt says blue sky question of the week you know you know we might don't threaten me with a good time

1332
02:07:19,008 --> 02:07:21,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that is going to do it.

1333
02:07:22,209 --> 02:07:23,909
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

1334
02:07:23,949 --> 02:07:25,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all for listening to our show tonight.

1335
02:07:25,330 --> 02:07:25,990
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate it.

1336
02:07:26,350 --> 02:07:27,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for being here.

1337
02:07:27,671 --> 02:07:31,692
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back in seven days to do it all over again just before we head into Halloween week.

1338
02:07:31,812 --> 02:07:38,794
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's going to be Halloween weekend for many of you because I know Rocky Horror for me is next weekend and a lot of people have Halloween parties and events.

1339
02:07:39,174 --> 02:07:42,055
[SPEAKER_01]: My ballet studio is doing a time warp.

1340
02:07:42,295 --> 02:07:43,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's cute.

1341
02:07:43,555 --> 02:07:46,256
[SPEAKER_01]: I opted not to participate because I like my Fridays.

1342
02:07:46,704 --> 02:07:49,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but Halloween being a Wednesday is just a really weird day this year.

1343
02:07:49,827 --> 02:07:52,350
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, people are doing things on the weekend and stuff.

1344
02:07:52,410 --> 02:07:53,391
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.

1345
02:07:54,012 --> 02:07:56,655
[SPEAKER_02]: SGO100Matt says, slow news week, but finished usual time.

1346
02:07:56,675 --> 02:07:59,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, DarkSakura had some stuff to say at the top of the show.

1347
02:08:00,539 --> 02:08:00,879
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.

1348
02:08:02,060 --> 02:08:02,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I not?

1349
02:08:02,781 --> 02:08:03,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, you did.

1350
02:08:03,502 --> 02:08:03,762
[SPEAKER_01]: You did.

1351
02:08:04,483 --> 02:08:04,703
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1352
02:08:05,063 --> 02:08:06,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, happy early birthday, Mike Deft.

1353
02:08:06,945 --> 02:08:09,188
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you have a good time celebrating whatever it is you do.

1354
02:08:10,168 --> 02:08:11,069
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy Birthday!

1355
02:08:35,988 --> 02:08:53,019
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think I would actually I would be willing to have like one lane that is the full feed with repost and another one that's without that's why I need to force myself to use Blue Sky to manage multiple decks at once because then I can have the OLR deck in there too that might be something I do so we'll see we'll see

1356
02:08:53,902 --> 02:08:56,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, but thank you as always for listening to our show.

1357
02:08:56,865 --> 02:08:57,365
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate it.

1358
02:08:57,405 --> 02:09:00,047
[SPEAKER_02]: If you enjoyed what you heard here, tell a friend or two about the show.

1359
02:09:00,087 --> 02:09:04,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.

1360
02:09:05,372 --> 02:09:09,455
[SPEAKER_02]: A nice rebleat or whatever it is you want about our show goes an awful long way.

1361
02:09:09,776 --> 02:09:13,879
[SPEAKER_02]: A nice five-star review on iTunes, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you found this show.

1362
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:15,300
[SPEAKER_02]: We will take that as well.

1363
02:09:15,461 --> 02:09:16,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

1364
02:09:17,542 --> 02:09:21,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, SGO100Matt says register to vote and vote early if your state is letting you.

1365
02:09:21,406 --> 02:09:22,607
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that is great advice.

1366
02:09:23,307 --> 02:09:25,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, there's the big election everybody's talking about.

1367
02:09:25,529 --> 02:09:32,095
[SPEAKER_02]: That is important, especially if you are in the state of Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, you know the ones.

1368
02:09:32,475 --> 02:09:32,735
[SPEAKER_02]: But

1369
02:09:33,456 --> 02:09:35,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Every election, don't forget, school board elections.

1370
02:09:35,877 --> 02:09:36,757
[SPEAKER_02]: They're important too.

1371
02:09:37,678 --> 02:09:38,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Always vote.

1372
02:09:38,518 --> 02:09:38,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1373
02:09:39,118 --> 02:09:42,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Know at least if the people are assholes or not.

1374
02:09:42,900 --> 02:09:57,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, like in the case of the mayor here locally, because I was like, I don't, to be honest, I didn't know much about the candidates, but I went onto the Facebook pages and all the worst people I know on Facebook are dunking, like are just going off on the comments on this one candidate.

1375
02:09:57,686 --> 02:10:03,048
[SPEAKER_02]: So I said, oh, she must be the one I'm going to vote for them because all the, the enemy of, the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

1376
02:10:04,091 --> 02:10:04,651
[SPEAKER_01]: Not always.

1377
02:10:05,392 --> 02:10:06,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Not always, but in this case.

1378
02:10:06,292 --> 02:10:07,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Do your research, people.

1379
02:10:07,272 --> 02:10:08,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Not always, but in this case.

1380
02:10:10,033 --> 02:10:16,296
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would also just like to point out that also be sure that you're voting for someone with a functional brain cell.

1381
02:10:17,276 --> 02:10:18,677
[SPEAKER_02]: That is important.

1382
02:10:19,417 --> 02:10:19,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me.

1383
02:10:20,578 --> 02:10:25,920
[SPEAKER_02]: As somebody who dated a politician, before I was with Alan, I was dating a politician.

1384
02:10:28,002 --> 02:10:34,224
[SPEAKER_02]: and if there's one thing I learned from that whole experience, it is any idiot can run for office.

1385
02:10:34,645 --> 02:10:35,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody.

1386
02:10:35,605 --> 02:10:37,366
[SPEAKER_02]: You can run for office.

1387
02:10:37,426 --> 02:10:37,986
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do it.

1388
02:10:38,046 --> 02:10:40,207
[SPEAKER_01]: We've already seen an idiot run for office.

1389
02:10:40,627 --> 02:10:47,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're seeing it in real time certainly on a national scale but let me tell you, I definitely have seen it on a local scale

1390
02:10:48,815 --> 02:10:49,255
[SPEAKER_02]: as well.

1391
02:10:49,575 --> 02:10:51,416
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's just all be thankful he didn't win.

1392
02:10:52,136 --> 02:10:52,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1393
02:10:52,576 --> 02:10:52,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1394
02:10:53,316 --> 02:10:58,617
[SPEAKER_02]: But he got more votes than anybody with his party had in the long very scary prospect.

1395
02:10:58,737 --> 02:10:58,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1396
02:10:59,697 --> 02:10:59,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1397
02:11:00,997 --> 02:11:02,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody can have office.

1398
02:11:02,978 --> 02:11:03,638
[SPEAKER_02]: So, alright.

1399
02:11:05,478 --> 02:11:07,019
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, let's get to your final thought.

1400
02:11:07,059 --> 02:11:10,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're gonna be trying to stream some Dead by Daylight, but maybe ultimately something else.

1401
02:11:10,799 --> 02:11:12,380
[SPEAKER_02]: But do you have some final thoughts for us tonight?

1402
02:11:14,040 --> 02:11:14,140
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

1403
02:11:15,854 --> 02:11:27,496

1404
02:11:28,905 --> 02:11:46,516
[SPEAKER_05]: um yeah it's just you know I'm busy on uh you know content creation stuff go like me or go follow me on blue sky if you don't I guess yeah there you go probably I think everybody that's listening does already I think yeah most people you never know it's hard to know who's out there on the podcast feed because uh you know we don't see them right in front of our face and

1405
02:11:47,196 --> 02:12:15,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I beg for emails we don't always get them but I understand some of you are commuting or you're busy at work and all that stuff so it's fine but yes we appreciate follows there and all that good stuff let's see my final thought tonight is I have a very busy weekend next weekend with show hosting I was very happy to do a show last night Aurelio Voltaire was here and did an amazing job a lot of fun always puts on a fun show we had so many local artists that were also doing incredible jobs so it was called the Sinister Soiree because it's

1406
02:12:15,680 --> 02:12:17,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Sinister Creature Compost Party was great.

1407
02:12:17,161 --> 02:12:17,761
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a lot of fun.

1408
02:12:18,021 --> 02:12:20,203
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing some shows next weekend, including Cabaret Macabre.

[SPEAKER_02]: Really excited.

[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, Fifth Dream.

1420
02:12:39,193 --> 02:12:40,714
[SPEAKER_02]: He used to go by just Voltaire, but

1421
02:12:41,274 --> 02:12:42,635
[SPEAKER_02]: due to reasons and things, etc.

1422
02:12:42,675 --> 02:12:43,575
[SPEAKER_02]: He uses his full name.

1423
02:12:44,896 --> 02:12:49,078
[SPEAKER_02]: And he taught me a mnemonic on how to say his name, which it's Aurelio.

1424
02:12:49,419 --> 02:12:51,640
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just say Aurelio is how you say his name.

1425
02:12:51,680 --> 02:12:55,282
[SPEAKER_02]: So Aurelio Valtere is his full name that he goes by now.

1426
02:12:55,522 --> 02:12:56,582
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, great performer.

1427
02:12:57,243 --> 02:12:57,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Great guy.

1428
02:12:57,743 --> 02:13:00,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy that he came all the way out to little old Sacramento.

1429
02:13:01,205 --> 02:13:01,505
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1430
02:13:02,365 --> 02:13:03,946
[SPEAKER_02]: On that note, we're going to wrap it up.
