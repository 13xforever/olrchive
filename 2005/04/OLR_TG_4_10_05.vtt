You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
Your podcast calls for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
Yes, that's right.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
A little new sound there, a little bit of a new intro there.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
The Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
I know we changed things up a little bit around here.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.240
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky. Joining me as always, my awesome co-host

00:33.240 --> 00:36.920
here with me to talk about video games that don't suck. Say hello to

00:36.920 --> 00:41.640
Jamie, also known as DarkSakura. There's plenty of games out there that suck.

00:41.640 --> 00:47.160
Avoid them, please. Please, we beg you to. Don't give them any more money.

00:47.160 --> 00:50.600
And also with us, as always, say hello to Loki.

00:50.600 --> 00:53.880
Hi, I'm here again. Yes, you are. Yes.

00:53.880 --> 00:56.600
All right, so you notice we kind of changed things a little bit there in the

00:56.600 --> 01:02.240
intro you know I'm sure as a lot of you have noticed we haven't been talking a

01:02.240 --> 01:05.560
whole lot about rhythm and music games here on the podcast so we kind of

01:05.560 --> 01:09.640
thought we'd refocus ourselves a little bit and you know tell you guys what we're

01:09.640 --> 01:13.720
really all about and that's just kind of general video gaming what gamers really

01:13.720 --> 01:18.360
want to know about so now if you're a DDR fan you know don't get upset because

01:18.360 --> 01:21.560
we're still going to talk about rhythm and music games plenty on this show when

01:21.560 --> 01:25.280
we find out you know that a lot of stuff is going on new stuff in the world we

01:25.280 --> 01:28.900
We will bring it to you as soon as we find out, but for now, we're going to talk about

01:28.900 --> 01:30.220
other types of video games.

01:30.220 --> 01:33.400
For instance, the types of games we've been playing this week.

01:33.400 --> 01:34.400
Start off with Dark Sakura.

01:34.400 --> 01:35.920
How's your gaming week been?

01:35.920 --> 01:42.600
Um, other than the typical, you know, widescreen pong, not much, really.

01:42.600 --> 01:43.600
I don't know.

01:43.600 --> 01:46.720
I play with my new phone a bit, my new phone that angers me so much.

01:46.720 --> 01:47.720
Like cell phone gaming?

01:47.720 --> 01:51.280
No, I don't, I usually delete all the stupid games off of my cell phone.

01:51.280 --> 01:54.120
Have you seen some of those games you can download on the cell phone, though?

01:54.120 --> 01:55.400
I have Bejeweled on my phone.

01:55.400 --> 01:57.120
And I know we were talking about this a little bit last week.

01:57.120 --> 02:00.680
Remember we were talking about in the last podcast about the Chinese cell phone games

02:00.680 --> 02:03.540
that you can get that are just like, you can get Life Force?

02:03.540 --> 02:04.540
You can get them in Japan.

02:04.540 --> 02:05.540
Yeah.

02:05.540 --> 02:07.040
Like, I want that Final Fantasy VII game.

02:07.040 --> 02:08.040
Heck yeah.

02:08.040 --> 02:09.040
The Turks game.

02:09.040 --> 02:10.040
Heck yeah.

02:10.040 --> 02:14.040
But, you know, the best thing we get, you know, I have Impossible Mission, which was,

02:14.040 --> 02:18.040
don't get me wrong, one of the greatest Commodore 64 games of all time, but it sucks on the

02:18.040 --> 02:19.040
cell phone.

02:19.040 --> 02:20.040
You can't even see the room.

02:20.040 --> 02:23.600
They do have Gradius for the US phone, I found out, but it's not for anything I think that

02:23.600 --> 02:30.360
we have and they shoot there was a game that I was thinking when you said

02:30.360 --> 02:36.240
impossible mission I think they should put incredible crisis that'd be cool I

02:36.240 --> 02:41.040
don't have all the music on there though but who knows what technology is so any

02:41.040 --> 02:44.640
other games that's it just cell phones that's really it all right fair enough

02:44.640 --> 02:49.640
Loki what do you been up to I've been playing my PSP then what I do I was

02:49.640 --> 02:56.060
Was mainly playing Wipeout Pure only because my boss was borrowing the Twisted Metal head

02:56.060 --> 03:00.640
on because he doesn't have any games for his so I felt bad for him so I loaned him that

03:00.640 --> 03:02.240
for a few days.

03:02.240 --> 03:05.040
So I've been playing Wipeout Pure and it's pretty fun.

03:05.040 --> 03:12.080
I actually hated Wipeout and I don't know, it's nice right now while I have one game.

03:12.080 --> 03:17.040
I'm getting more games coming down on Monday so I'll have Luminous and Ridge Racer finally

03:17.040 --> 03:23.880
and then 512 megabyte memory sticks so I can put all my pirated episodes of Robot Chicken

03:23.880 --> 03:30.160
on there. That's my favorite. Then the other game I got was Zookeeper for the DS and I

03:30.160 --> 03:35.220
can see why I didn't get it before because it's kind of annoying. Like I actually had

03:35.220 --> 03:39.940
to turn the background music off on it because it was that annoying. Just repeated like every

03:39.940 --> 03:45.920
five seconds and it's just awful. Now I've been checking out Zookeeper too since you

03:45.920 --> 03:51.720
picked it up which basically zookeepers just bejeweled on the DS like one minor

03:51.720 --> 03:55.560
change that's the animal theme and that's about it so it's basically bejeweled

03:55.560 --> 04:00.640
doesn't it feel like one of those games that was really rushed to come out just

04:00.640 --> 04:04.360
because there are no other games out on the DS so yeah people would buy it yes

04:04.360 --> 04:07.760
exactly it's what it is because there's like no depth to it it's just like ooh

04:07.760 --> 04:11.800
it's a game I can pick up play for a little bit and I'm done actually I

04:11.800 --> 04:15.880
honestly I got it for my fiance because she wanted a game that she can

04:15.880 --> 04:21.520
play that's easy so I see how it is so I got her that so she'd stop bitching so

04:21.520 --> 04:25.720
yeah it's been that that in Final Fantasy 11 of course and played a little

04:25.720 --> 04:29.640
Katamari Damacy today just it just because I was listening to the

04:29.640 --> 04:32.920
soundtrack and it's like oh okay I'll play that again because you know they're

04:32.920 --> 04:36.760
working on all well they announced you know obviously the release date for

04:36.760 --> 04:41.660
Katamari Damacy 2 in Japan in Japan yeah but I'm sure it'll make its way over

04:41.660 --> 04:48.260
over here. Damn well better. And so I just had to play it just for fun. So I did that.

04:48.260 --> 04:53.380
Right on. Yeah. My gaming week, I was also playing the zookeeper on the DS and I was

04:53.380 --> 04:56.460
kind of meh. I think I played it for about five minutes and I was like I've played this

04:56.460 --> 05:00.980
game before. Bejeweled 2 is cooler than zookeeper. Why don't they put Bejeweled 2 on the DS?

05:00.980 --> 05:05.100
At least you got like the super jewels and things like that. And it's got like a better

05:05.100 --> 05:09.500
theme where a zookeeper gets eh eh eh. You know the bleeps and bloops. It sounds like

05:09.500 --> 05:13.140
Atari 2600. It's hella annoying. The other game I got to check out this week, thanks

05:13.140 --> 05:18.740
to Loki actually, managed to snag me a copy of Doom 3 on the Xbox, which, you know, I

05:18.740 --> 05:23.700
have to admit, I wasn't really interested in Doom 3 at all. I mean, I guess it's hard

05:23.700 --> 05:28.380
because I really liked Doom and Doom 2 when they were out years ago. You remember how

05:28.380 --> 05:33.180
they were like the first, like, first person games? They were kind of like this sequel

05:33.180 --> 05:37.500
to Wolfenstein in a way, in a way, not really, but they were kind of like the next evolution

05:37.500 --> 05:41.500
It was Wolfenstein with ramps. Well, not really ramps, actually.

05:41.500 --> 05:43.500
Well, and then multiplayer, which was really cool.

05:43.500 --> 05:48.500
Well, you remember, like, if you ever created your own maps in Wolfenstein, it's very 2D.

05:48.500 --> 05:52.500
Wolfenstein is really, it's like you take a 2D level and you put yourself in it.

05:52.500 --> 05:53.500
I remember doing that.

05:53.500 --> 05:56.500
But Doom was very 3D. That's where it was coming from.

05:56.500 --> 05:58.500
And it had the Wolfenstein level.

05:58.500 --> 05:59.500
It did. It did.

05:59.500 --> 06:05.500
It had to do the level skip code, but you could get there. I believe it was level 40-something?

06:05.500 --> 06:10.940
It was one of the levels that was actually Wolfenstein was actually in Doom, it was cool.

06:10.940 --> 06:16.180
But I don't know, for some reason now I'm kind of jaded by this over amount of first

06:16.180 --> 06:19.780
person shooters and I'm kind of like, sure I'll play Halo once in a while because it's

06:19.780 --> 06:22.300
a good game, but I don't get into a whole lot of others.

06:22.300 --> 06:26.060
So I have to admit I was kind of like, it seems a little late for Doom 3, I'm not that

06:26.060 --> 06:30.580
excited about it, but I was actually pleasantly surprised with Doom 3.

06:30.580 --> 06:33.220
It's quite more to it than I thought.

06:33.220 --> 06:36.140
It's not like the other Dooms where you just jump in, start shooting.

06:36.140 --> 06:37.300
Even Halo's a lot like that.

06:37.300 --> 06:41.860
Sure, Halo has its big cinematic opening, but it's kind of really just jump in, start

06:41.860 --> 06:42.860
shooting.

06:42.860 --> 06:48.180
But Halo also has, Halo 2 anyway, has where you can take the vehicles and completely abandon

06:48.180 --> 06:50.980
the game and fly around and go places you're not supposed to go.

06:50.980 --> 06:53.660
There's plenty of differences between Halo 2 and Doom 3.

06:53.660 --> 06:56.460
I'm not going to try and compare the two, but I'm just kind of, you know, I think a

06:56.460 --> 06:59.740
lot of times because they're first person shooters, we kind of inadvertently compare

06:59.740 --> 07:00.740
them.

07:00.740 --> 07:05.340
it wasn't just jump in and go, it was kind of like a, you know, move around, talk to

07:05.340 --> 07:11.060
people, almost like a quest in the beginning, and then you start killing things and zombies

07:11.060 --> 07:13.660
and stuff, and it gets really scary too.

07:13.660 --> 07:17.760
Like I remember the way you would get scared with Doom 2 is that, you know, you'd have

07:17.760 --> 07:22.020
to play with all the lights off, and then with the headphones on, and like the pixelated

07:22.020 --> 07:26.340
monster jumps out from behind you, but now with Doom 3, it's really scary, there's like

07:26.340 --> 07:30.900
bodies hanging from ceilings and zombies that jump up from the floor and stuff, it's pretty

07:30.900 --> 07:31.900
freaky.

07:31.900 --> 07:32.900
I need to see this.

07:32.900 --> 07:33.900
I really do.

07:33.900 --> 07:34.900
I'm going to have to show this to you.

07:34.900 --> 07:35.900
It's pretty cool.

07:35.900 --> 07:36.900
Wasn't it on PC as well?

07:36.900 --> 07:37.900
Yes.

07:37.900 --> 07:38.900
It actually started on PC, but Xbox has...

07:38.900 --> 07:40.600
I think I have it somewhere hanging around my house.

07:40.600 --> 07:44.060
The cool thing about Doom 3 on Xbox is it has the Xbox Live stuff in it, although I

07:44.060 --> 07:46.300
don't know anybody else with the game, so I can't play anybody yet.

07:46.300 --> 07:50.300
And yeah, and they'll see the other thing is that it runs on your console without having

07:50.300 --> 07:53.300
to buy a new graphics card, new processor...

07:53.300 --> 07:54.300
Exactly.

07:54.300 --> 07:55.800
It's built for the Xbox.

07:55.800 --> 07:57.840
And it actually looks pretty damn good.

07:57.840 --> 08:02.740
One thing I really like about Doom 3 is that it's got an incredible detail level.

08:02.740 --> 08:07.620
Like when you want to look at the access panel to a door, okay in most games it's just like

08:07.620 --> 08:11.360
a little green light or a red light and it turns green, but like in this one you can

08:11.360 --> 08:16.680
actually walk up to it and then zoom in and it seamlessly is zooming in and you actually

08:16.680 --> 08:20.720
can see like a number pad that you have to punch in an access code to get through the

08:20.720 --> 08:21.720
door.

08:21.720 --> 08:22.720
It's crazy.

08:22.720 --> 08:23.720
Pretty insane.

08:23.720 --> 08:24.720
Yeah.

08:24.720 --> 08:27.580
it anyway so that's pretty much my game

08:27.580 --> 08:28.980
well that and there's like these panels

08:28.980 --> 08:30.260
that you walk around that like have

08:30.260 --> 08:32.900
video playing it's like an actual like

08:32.900 --> 08:34.980
video talking about the whole facility

08:34.980 --> 08:37.180
that welcome to Mars and don't get

08:37.180 --> 08:42.020
killed welcome to recall alright let's

08:42.020 --> 08:43.300
start off with some gaming news tonight

08:43.300 --> 08:44.620
I'll actually talk about another game

08:44.620 --> 08:47.820
that's on its way towards Xbox this is

08:47.820 --> 08:50.520
an update for an old classic comic strip

08:50.520 --> 08:52.100
and this was a game of one time as well

08:52.100 --> 08:53.540
I remember this one you remember spy

08:53.540 --> 08:59.460
versus Spy. Oh my god I have Spy vs. Spy comics in my bathroom. Exactly you had

08:59.460 --> 09:02.780
Mad Magazine right and then it you know spun off but it was an old-school

09:02.780 --> 09:07.060
Commodore 64 game too. It came out on the NES. Yeah it was on the NES as well I remember there were like

09:07.060 --> 09:11.740
three versions on the Commodore it was an awesome game. Well now it's out on the Xbox and of

09:11.740 --> 09:16.180
course Spy vs. Spy being based on the comic slapstick humor and all that you

09:16.180 --> 09:20.140
get the white spy versus the black spy so in the game you are going to become a

09:20.140 --> 09:24.860
spy obviously and you attempt to outwit up to three opponents so I don't know

09:24.860 --> 09:29.340
how that really works blue spy red spy I guess I don't know you go across the

09:29.340 --> 09:33.540
game's 12 levels there's weapons booby traps and gadgets it's kind of sounds

09:33.540 --> 09:37.420
very similar to the other one the other cool thing about spy versus spy though

09:37.420 --> 09:41.140
and I always like it when game companies do this it's a 1999 title so they're

09:41.140 --> 09:45.420
starting this off as a budget and there's a reason why it's 1999 cuz you

09:45.420 --> 09:51.340
get what you pay for people. Hey we paid $19.99 for Katamari Damacy. That's right. Yeah that's

09:51.340 --> 09:55.420
right but you know what that was one of those exceptions to the rule okay. I thought Technic

09:55.420 --> 10:00.420
Beat which came out the same time was very cool as well. Maybe a $29 game. Come on Rup

10:00.420 --> 10:06.020
this is Spy vs Spy. Spy vs Spy for the NES suck. I have a fond place in my heart for

10:06.020 --> 10:10.500
the Spy vs Spy Commodore games because I was a kid when those were out and it was great.

10:10.500 --> 10:13.980
Horrible reviews. I don't even think anyone actually wanted to review this game. Well

10:13.980 --> 10:16.560
I'll tell you though well here's the thing that might make you go kind of

10:16.560 --> 10:20.640
maybe this is a crappy game don't know yet though PlayStation 2 version got

10:20.640 --> 10:27.200
canceled they decide not to do it seems very interesting yeah I think I would

10:27.200 --> 10:32.320
have to get spy versus by just because yeah I know it's gonna be the just

10:32.320 --> 10:35.800
because factor and that not get it for 30% off someone should send me a free

10:35.800 --> 10:40.500
one I like that idea I'll just get it for cheap if you have a free copy spy

10:40.500 --> 10:44.580
versus spy you want to send us to go t-o-g-o at orange launch radio.com in

10:44.580 --> 10:47.420
fact you could really write us about anything well we'll read whatever emails

10:47.420 --> 10:52.800
you got to send us um let's talk old-school consoles for a minute I

10:52.800 --> 10:57.660
think this is really cool this story it talks about the Atari 2600 can you

10:57.660 --> 11:01.620
believe there's still new Atari 2600 news after all these years hey people

11:01.620 --> 11:08.020
are still making ROMs for the 2600 well you got it here it is retro redo it was

11:08.020 --> 11:13.960
a 24-hour video game programming contest held last weekend in New York and so

11:13.960 --> 11:16.640
there were nine teams that were doing this and they were all making new games

11:16.640 --> 11:20.620
and they were given away these awards for the best visuals, most innovative, the

11:20.620 --> 11:25.560
best sound. You want to know the name of the game that won it all? Do tell. Ninja

11:25.560 --> 11:31.540
Garden. What? Ninja Garden. Okay. This is the game that won it all but here's the

11:31.540 --> 11:35.520
cool thing as a prize you know how they have those Atari flashback consoles now

11:35.520 --> 11:36.520
I've seen that.

11:36.520 --> 11:37.520
It's like 50 bucks!

11:37.520 --> 11:38.520
But, okay, whatever.

11:38.520 --> 11:53.520
The prize is, is that this game, Ninja Garden, is going to be included in the next version

11:53.520 --> 11:54.520
of that.

11:54.520 --> 11:55.520
Huh, pretty cool.

11:55.520 --> 11:57.080
It's kind of the, you know, new, secret game.

11:57.080 --> 12:00.040
Truth be told, people, you could actually probably pull a chip out of one of those that

12:00.040 --> 12:03.840
actually flash any ROMs you want on there, but whatever.

12:03.840 --> 12:06.440
that we encourage you to break your warranty and do that.

12:06.440 --> 12:08.600
Oh, come on, a warranty on a $20 item.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.280
Woo, got to replace that one.

12:10.280 --> 12:13.280
Are they releasing that thing with the wood paneling?

12:13.280 --> 12:14.720
No, it's not.

12:14.720 --> 12:17.240
You know it's not the old wood panel style

12:17.240 --> 12:18.360
we had way back in the day.

12:18.360 --> 12:18.920
It's the kind that I have.

12:18.920 --> 12:20.320
It's a cheap, cheap plastic.

12:20.320 --> 12:21.600
The third release one, right?

12:21.600 --> 12:22.480
Exactly.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.120
Well, I don't even know if it exactly

12:24.120 --> 12:27.680
looks like one of those, but.

12:27.680 --> 12:31.760
From old system to very new system, PSP, a lot of folks

12:31.760 --> 12:33.320
were saying, oh, it sold great.

12:33.320 --> 12:38.240
the best system ever in sales and some people were saying at disappointing well

12:38.240 --> 12:43.720
the first week sales figures are out now and the PSP sold six hundred thousand

12:43.720 --> 12:48.520
units in its first week you know what that oh yeah you know what that equates

12:48.520 --> 12:52.400
to about a hundred and fifty million dollars good then so you'll be able to

12:52.400 --> 12:59.720
pay that ninety million dollars off yeah we'll see we'll see about that one all

12:59.720 --> 13:06.400
Alright, also in other handheld gaming news, Nintendo's got this DS, you might have heard

13:06.400 --> 13:10.560
of this new game on the way for the DS, it's called Electroplankton, I've never heard about

13:10.560 --> 13:11.720
this at all.

13:11.720 --> 13:16.080
They have like, I thought there was like a website for this or something, yeah they do

13:16.080 --> 13:20.740
have a website out there for it, but it's kind of like a, it's one of those things they're

13:20.740 --> 13:26.680
saying it's not really a game, but it's one of those like music type drawing and you get

13:26.680 --> 13:30.800
the music beats, and I don't really know how to describe this until I play it, but I know

13:30.800 --> 13:33.460
it's getting a lot of buzz around it.

13:33.460 --> 13:36.080
But they're doing an interesting promotion here, Nintendo is.

13:36.080 --> 13:39.920
What they're going to be doing, they're actually going to have an aquarium exhibition hall

13:39.920 --> 13:44.200
at this Tokyo show from April 8th to 14th.

13:44.200 --> 13:47.240
Entrance is free, and you get to see the whole thing.

13:47.240 --> 13:53.160
And the cool thing about this is Nintendo's going to be giving away only 10 limited edition

13:53.160 --> 13:57.640
electroplankton ds units should be interesting

13:57.640 --> 14:01.840
and by the looks of it I am it pretty much looks exactly like a normal ds

14:01.840 --> 14:04.200
except there's this whole sticker on it

14:04.200 --> 14:07.800
it might be an engraving though you know engraving whatever it

14:07.800 --> 14:11.240
at sliding but anyways it's just

14:11.240 --> 14:14.240
it's actually actually what that is it is an engraving it's the original

14:14.240 --> 14:16.840
electroplankton artwork

14:16.840 --> 14:19.920
so whoever's gonna get that they're gonna put it on friggin eBay it's gonna sell

14:19.920 --> 14:20.520
for a lot

14:20.520 --> 14:23.680
Yeah, we'll see, we'll see. Speaking of Nintendo,

14:23.680 --> 14:27.160
you know how we have in San Francisco, now we, you know, we based our show out of

14:27.160 --> 14:29.580
Sacramento, so San Francisco's just a drive up the road,

14:29.580 --> 14:33.180
and in San Francisco they have the official Sony PlayStation Store at the

14:33.180 --> 14:34.740
Sony Metron. You've been there before, right?

14:34.740 --> 14:39.660
Yeah. It's fun, huh? It's a big geek place. Oh yeah. The whole Metron is just geek central.

14:39.660 --> 14:43.460
It's cool. And with overpriced games. And overpriced food. But still, it's fun,

14:43.460 --> 14:46.580
you know. Well, if you're on the other coast,

14:46.580 --> 14:49.700
there's a gaming company that's going to be doing something similar for you guys.

14:49.700 --> 14:59.200
in New York City, Rockefeller Center will soon be home to the Nintendo World Store,

14:59.200 --> 15:06.640
a two story complex, Mario, Zelda, Nintendo, you think of it, also the location will host

15:06.640 --> 15:13.960
the brand-new Pokemon Center joy joy joy can we like leave our kids there put

15:13.960 --> 15:17.080
them in pokeball just like people are gonna do that anyway you know it's gonna

15:17.080 --> 15:25.800
happen I'm really surprised doing it in Seattle since the Nintendo headquarters

15:25.800 --> 15:31.160
is just north of Tacoma that is kind of surprising to me but you know it's fun

15:31.160 --> 15:33.900
to try stuff on the other coast too I mean we get spoiled here on the west

15:33.900 --> 15:38.060
coast sometimes with all these technology things so you know I grew up

15:38.060 --> 15:43.420
in Alabama I'm not complaining I was gonna say you know it's also over well

15:43.420 --> 15:47.380
not exactly on the East Coast with the West Coast by the you know Microsoft you

15:47.380 --> 15:51.620
know they've got to have their you know yeah so this is thing okay if Sony has

15:51.620 --> 15:56.900
chosen San Francisco and Nintendo has chosen New York where's Microsoft gonna

15:56.900 --> 16:08.180
go hopefully Alaska no I'm kidding I'm kidding the South Pole probably LA who

16:08.180 --> 16:14.240
knows we'll see now Jamie I know you're a big fan of Namco the company right why

16:14.240 --> 16:18.040
are you such a fan of Namco I worked for them oh so you saw a lot of company

16:18.040 --> 16:23.720
loyalty I had the coolest uniform shirt ever it was red and black and had

16:23.720 --> 16:30.040
Pac-Man on it. What's the coolest thing about Namco? Anything Tekken related.

16:30.040 --> 16:36.220
Alright, well what's actually coming out on the PlayStation 2 is NAMM collection.

16:36.220 --> 16:40.600
They've actually pushed this back though. It's gonna come out in Japan on June 2nd

16:40.600 --> 16:44.160
but it actually got pushed back a little bit. What is the NAMM collection? It's gonna

16:44.160 --> 16:49.760
be five classic PlayStation games. It's gonna be Ridge Racer, Ace Combat 2,

16:49.760 --> 17:06.440
The compilation is also going to have a gallery mode and movies with tips and tricks on how

17:06.440 --> 17:08.440
to get through the game.

17:08.440 --> 17:14.600
You remember on the old Playstation they had the NAMCO, it sounds like they are doing that

17:14.600 --> 17:18.680
all over again but now for the newer games because Playstation, believe it or not, is

17:18.680 --> 17:25.520
getting to be like 10 years old it's kind of sad you know this sounds like a

17:25.520 --> 17:31.040
desperate attempt at money well isn't isn't everything come on if you want to

17:31.040 --> 17:34.760
play Tekken go buy Tekken 5 I mean because you have no Tekken in there

17:34.760 --> 17:39.680
that's true but it's just like okay it's like how Nintendo released those retro

17:39.680 --> 17:43.600
games that are available on the advance and one of the games you can buy is

17:43.600 --> 17:48.600
Metroid but hello spend ten more dollars and you could get Metroid zero mission

18:18.600 --> 18:22.260
to talk about games all the time because you know if we talked about games all

18:22.260 --> 18:27.980
the time we'd have no time to go clubbing so what we're here to do as

18:27.980 --> 18:31.440
well is we're here to better your life and who better to give you some advice

18:31.440 --> 18:35.640
on how to better your life than our very own dark Sakura with her advice column

18:35.640 --> 18:43.860
and Jamie what are you gonna tell the kids about tonight well this one I think

18:43.860 --> 18:48.860
think is very, very useful. One that everybody needs to know.

18:48.860 --> 18:51.860
And what's this? How to treat a bullet or knife wound.

18:51.860 --> 18:56.860
Ah, okay. Because you know, it always happens when you get in one of those heated,

18:56.860 --> 19:01.860
soul-calor battles where someone ends up getting cut in the end.

19:01.860 --> 19:05.860
So this is good to know. Well, you ready?

19:05.860 --> 19:10.860
Of course. Number one, do not immediately pull out any impaled objects.

19:10.860 --> 19:16.860
The object may be pressed against an artery or other vital internal structure and may actually be helping to reduce the bleeding.

19:40.860 --> 19:46.620
Now I know why that doesn't happen precisely. I learned something today. Anyway, sorry number two

19:47.140 --> 19:54.220
Control the bleeding by using a combination of direct pressure limb elevation pressure points and tourniquets in that order

19:54.580 --> 20:00.940
three and mobilize the injured area using splints and dressings to immobilize an injured area helps protect the

20:01.060 --> 20:07.340
From further injury and maintain clots that have begun to form for dress the wound and strive to prevent infection

20:07.340 --> 20:13.700
infection doesn't say how. That means dump a bottle of vodka on their legs. Um, five,

20:13.700 --> 20:16.860
get medical attention as soon as possible. But of course, you know what I always say

20:16.860 --> 20:24.440
in the end? Yes? Don't get shot, stupid duck! Thank you very much for that lovely piece

20:24.440 --> 20:30.700
of advice. Well, it's, people, if bullets are flying, freaking hide. If somebody runs

20:30.700 --> 20:35.460
a gun, or if somebody pulls a gun, you run, like a little bitch. Exactly. Of course, you

20:35.460 --> 20:38.500
usually end up getting shot in the back.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.580
You won't care!

20:40.580 --> 20:42.180
Be careful.

20:42.180 --> 20:46.540
Speaking of getting shot, you remember how the Godfather, the movie, had a game come

20:46.540 --> 20:48.180
out pretty recently?

20:48.180 --> 20:50.100
They made, like, the Godfather game.

20:50.100 --> 20:54.980
Well, did you know that the Godfather game did not have everybody's blessing in coming

20:54.980 --> 20:55.980
out?

20:55.980 --> 20:58.280
In fact, some people are quite irritated about this game coming out.

20:58.280 --> 21:01.620
You know who one of the folks is that's pretty irritated about it?

21:01.620 --> 21:07.580
Francis Ford Coppola, who made the damn movies, is not happy about this.

21:07.580 --> 21:17.000
So he's expressed his displeasure with Paramount Pictures because they ended up selling the

21:17.000 --> 21:18.440
rights out.

21:18.440 --> 21:23.380
He's actually going to talk about this on an AMC show called Sunday Morning Shootout.

21:23.380 --> 21:25.840
This is what he says, I knew nothing about it.

21:25.840 --> 21:28.220
They never asked me if I thought it was a good idea.

21:28.220 --> 21:31.820
They use the characters, everyone knows, and then for the next hour they shoot and kill

21:31.820 --> 21:32.820
each other.

21:32.820 --> 21:35.260
I had absolutely nothing to do with this game, and I disapprove.

21:35.260 --> 21:41.100
Well yeah, that's why they didn't tell you about it, because it's going to suck.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.820
Like you'd actually approve that.

21:43.820 --> 21:46.940
That's the whole point, I mean, it's never going to work out.

21:46.940 --> 21:52.700
But hey, that's alright, we'll have a nice Grand Theft Auto clone.

21:52.700 --> 21:54.100
Phantasy Star.

21:54.100 --> 21:57.380
Some of you guys have played this out there, I know you used to play this a while ago,

21:57.380 --> 22:01.380
Sakura I've played it on and off it seems like I can never keep going with

22:01.380 --> 22:05.940
Phantasy Star online enough to go past like level 10 or 11 but maybe I'll get

22:05.940 --> 22:09.620
my chance when Phantasy Star universe comes out because it did just get

22:09.620 --> 22:14.220
confirmed for the US and it's gonna be out spring of 2006 it's gonna be out on

22:14.220 --> 22:23.700
the PC and the PlayStation 2 notice not Xbox not GameCube at least initially so

22:23.700 --> 22:27.140
you know you might have been wondering if this game was gonna come over but it

22:27.140 --> 22:31.820
definitely is of course this is being developed by Sega and it's only gonna be

22:31.820 --> 22:37.660
out though on the PlayStation 2 and the PC so hopefully it will have nothing to

22:37.660 --> 22:43.180
do with Phantasy Star Online volume 3 which was like the card game which was

22:43.180 --> 22:48.620
the suck hopefully it'll go back to the regular one we need blue burst the

22:48.620 --> 22:52.540
single-player campaign is expected to clock in at roughly 40 hours of play

22:52.540 --> 22:57.500
with three planets to explore and new enemies to fight gamers no longer have

22:57.500 --> 23:00.260
to go around on foot because there's actually gonna be vehicles in the game

23:00.260 --> 23:07.420
and of course there's going to be the online mode of course has to be you know

23:07.420 --> 23:11.340
I never really got into the old-school fantasy star games I really wish I had

23:11.340 --> 23:14.860
because I'm curious does fantasy star online actually have anything in common

23:14.860 --> 23:20.580
with the old older fantasy stars there's some things but there's like the the

23:20.580 --> 23:26.780
newman class or race there's the meseta is all the currency.

23:26.780 --> 23:28.860
So, some little things.

23:28.860 --> 23:30.820
It's got some things, yeah.

23:30.820 --> 23:36.900
But you know they released the Sega Ages collection in the states, right?

23:36.900 --> 23:37.900
Oh, really?

23:37.900 --> 23:39.620
And it had the fantasy star.

23:39.620 --> 23:41.660
You know the one that I brought over that was all the Japanese?

23:41.660 --> 23:42.660
Yeah, I remember that.

23:42.660 --> 23:45.500
It was the Fantasy Zone you brought over, right?

23:45.500 --> 23:51.580
our fantasy zone is Space Harrier but we also have a fantasy star.

23:51.580 --> 23:55.980
Oh very cool and they have this in the US now? Yeah. I was not aware. But it's like a collection now that

23:55.980 --> 23:57.420
you can get for like 30 bucks.

23:57.420 --> 24:00.700
Very cool. Instead of how I had to buy them which was all separate

24:00.700 --> 24:04.180
for the sake of ages. So you can get like fantasy, you can get it all on one disc?

24:04.180 --> 24:07.460
Pretty much. But you don't have to pick this up. Yeah. Dang. Very cool.

24:07.460 --> 24:10.660
Well from one role-playing series to another we have

24:10.660 --> 24:14.500
Final Fantasy VII Advent Children and

24:14.500 --> 24:17.700
you know there was actually a little bit a question is this going to come out in

24:17.700 --> 24:20.620
the US are we gonna have to import it what's going on well

24:20.620 --> 24:24.280
it's definitely coming out in the US because they have launched the North

24:24.280 --> 24:28.180
American website for Final Fantasy 7 Advent Children it's

24:28.180 --> 24:32.180
na.square-enix.com

24:32.180 --> 24:35.240
DVD slash FF7

24:35.240 --> 24:39.460
AC so it's coming out you can actually download the US trailer on here

24:39.460 --> 24:42.820
and it's definitely going to be coming out here's the interesting thing

24:42.820 --> 24:46.180
not just out on DVD but also will be coming out

24:46.180 --> 24:49.420
UMD. UMD, yep. Very interesting.

24:49.420 --> 24:52.980
Also announced, I'm not sure if you're gonna cover this, but... Go for it.

24:52.980 --> 24:56.900
Crysis Corps, which is another, it's gonna be a PSP

24:56.900 --> 25:00.820
game that's gonna be tying in with the whole, I forget what they're calling it,

25:00.820 --> 25:05.220
like the whole series of Final Fantasy VII stuff. Very cool. Is that the one with Vincent?

25:05.220 --> 25:08.500
No, that's something else. There's so many of them now, it's like

25:08.500 --> 25:13.340
For forever, people were saying, you know, oh there needs to be a sequel to Final Fantasy VII.

25:13.340 --> 25:15.860
Oh, there needs to be. And now suddenly, it's like, we're getting too many.

25:15.860 --> 25:17.340
I can't keep track of them all.

25:19.740 --> 25:22.340
Alright, so hopefully soon we'll be seeing this. Of course,

25:22.340 --> 25:26.020
not going to have a theatrical release. It's only going to be a DVD and UMD release.

25:26.020 --> 25:30.100
But, what is interesting about this is that they actually announced in Japan,

25:30.100 --> 25:35.300
Squeenix announced that they're going to be doing a special limited edition version.

25:35.300 --> 25:38.620
of course that's the way to go you know you release the regular one in the

25:38.620 --> 25:42.980
release a special edition for 20 bucks more course they haven't really said

25:42.980 --> 25:45.420
what's going to be in this special edition it's just

25:45.420 --> 25:49.580
bonus merchandise not available in the normal edition

25:49.580 --> 25:53.380
so wow how I don't know specific yeah

25:53.380 --> 25:57.060
hopefully we'll get more details on that in the next few weeks

25:57.060 --> 26:01.180
and lastly tonight I thought we could close on a story

26:01.180 --> 26:04.940
funny enough even though I said we're not going to be putting the rhythm music

26:04.940 --> 26:08.220
games in our podcast intro anymore, because we talk about all sorts of other stuff. I

26:08.220 --> 26:13.500
actually have a DDR story to talk about at the end here. Isn't that ironic?

26:13.500 --> 26:21.100
A little too ironic. It's like rain. Okay. West Virginia, they've

26:21.100 --> 26:27.020
got the Public Employees Insurance Agency. What they're doing, they've recruited 85 children

26:27.020 --> 26:33.320
to take part in a study aimed at reducing costs associated with covering obesity claims

26:33.320 --> 26:38.360
for its clients. What the study is doing is it's using DDR and it's trying to see

26:38.360 --> 26:44.040
if there's a possibility to encourage weight loss via DDR at an early age.

26:44.040 --> 26:49.400
Interesting. PEIA health promotions manager Nydia Henderson says

26:49.400 --> 26:54.320
today's kids are tomorrow's members. Obesity claims last year cost us 77

26:54.320 --> 26:59.880
million. We have to curtail these costs. The study is budgeted at $60,000 and hey

26:59.880 --> 27:04.520
guess what if you're one of the 85 fat kids in this program you get a free copy

27:04.520 --> 27:11.240
of a game system DDR and a DDR dance pad all complimentary for this but as a

27:11.240 --> 27:14.640
trade-off if you're in the six-month program you will have to play the game

27:14.640 --> 27:18.900
for a certain amount of time every day and you have to wear a meter and do all

27:18.900 --> 27:23.400
these reports and stuff as well and you also have to sell your soul just you

27:23.400 --> 27:28.520
know small text there to the Konami gods the insurance agency is also going to be

27:28.520 --> 27:35.360
using $10,000 to try the game out at 20 public schools very interesting all this

27:35.360 --> 27:39.480
DDR news about how you know it's just taken off out there and people use it

27:39.480 --> 27:43.240
for all these weight loss things and yet still no new arcade mix still not

27:43.240 --> 27:46.880
happening oh darn I think they're just forgetting something aren't they yeah

27:46.880 --> 27:50.560
it's just like something something's forgotten it seems like that whole fan

27:50.560 --> 27:53.880
base that helped DDR get big in the first place just suddenly you know

27:53.880 --> 27:59.180
forgotten oh well we do get the whole mixes with the eye toy and all that yeah

27:59.180 --> 28:03.000
but you know no new arcade things for you and your arcade makes it get me

28:03.000 --> 28:05.840
totally back in the arcade I'll be there in a heartbeat especially if it was by

28:05.840 --> 28:09.060
the folks that did ultra mix 2 which is by far the best DDR home release they've

28:09.060 --> 28:14.020
done in my opinion but what do I know I'm just some dumb podcast guy on the

28:14.020 --> 28:19.440
internet so from all us dumb internet celebrities from all us internet

28:19.440 --> 28:23.340
celebrity podcasters to you guys that's gonna do it for another episode of

28:23.340 --> 28:25.160
Orange Launch Radio to go.

28:25.160 --> 28:28.720
DarkSakura, your closing thought for us tonight.

28:28.720 --> 28:31.840
If you can't be an athlete, be an athletic supporter.

28:31.840 --> 28:32.840
Loki.

28:32.840 --> 28:34.960
I know there was something here.

28:34.960 --> 28:37.800
I was trying to find the goddamn website.

28:37.800 --> 28:46.480
Supposedly there's an ARG, Alternate Reality Gaming, a viral campaign for the XBox 2, 360,

28:46.480 --> 28:48.120
whatever the hell they're calling it.

28:48.120 --> 28:51.880
I thought it was called Colonies, because I actually looked at it at work.

28:51.880 --> 28:56.920
I've heard about this, but basically it's turning into a giant penis-waving competition

28:56.920 --> 29:03.320
because PlayStation 3 bumped up their showing of the console to beat Xbox and Nintendo at

29:03.320 --> 29:04.320
E3.

29:04.320 --> 29:07.120
It's just, and now Xbox signed up with a marketing campaign.

29:07.120 --> 29:09.360
It's just, they're all trying to one-up each other.

29:09.360 --> 29:10.360
We'll see what happens.

29:10.360 --> 29:11.360
Yeah.

29:11.360 --> 29:12.360
All right.

29:12.360 --> 29:13.360
Anyways.

29:13.360 --> 29:18.680
And my final thought is the Froger contains potassium benzoate.

29:18.680 --> 29:19.680
Special.

29:19.680 --> 29:20.680
All right.

29:20.680 --> 29:24.680
Alright, that's going to do it. See you guys next time here on the Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

29:24.680 --> 29:28.680
That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.
