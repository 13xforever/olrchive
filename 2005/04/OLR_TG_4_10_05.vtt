00:00.445 --> 00:03.667
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of April 11th, 2005.

00:04.007 --> 00:14.512
[SPEAKER_01]: You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

00:14.793 --> 00:18.314
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

00:19.515 --> 00:20.696
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's right.

00:21.676 --> 00:23.957
[SPEAKER_02]: A little new sound there, a little bit of a new intro there.

00:24.918 --> 00:26.239
[SPEAKER_02]: The Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition.

00:26.259 --> 00:28.700
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought we'd change things up a little bit around here.

00:29.212 --> 00:30.953
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

00:30.993 --> 00:35.654
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me as always, my awesome co-host here with me to talk about video games that don't suck.

00:36.014 --> 00:38.315
[SPEAKER_02]: Say hello to Jamie, also known as DarkSakura.

00:39.375 --> 00:41.336
[SPEAKER_03]: There's plenty of games out there that suck.

00:41.756 --> 00:43.136
[SPEAKER_03]: Avoid them, please.

00:43.777 --> 00:44.857
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, we beg you to.

00:44.957 --> 00:46.217
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't give them any more money.

00:47.378 --> 00:49.979
[SPEAKER_02]: And also with us, as always, say hello to Loki.

00:50.699 --> 00:52.019
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm here again.

00:52.419 --> 00:52.979
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you are.

00:53.380 --> 00:53.580
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

00:54.060 --> 00:57.181
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so you notice we kind of changed things a little bit there in the intro.

00:57.281 --> 00:57.601
[SPEAKER_02]: You know...

00:58.863 --> 01:14.389
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure as a lot of you have noticed, we haven't been talking a whole lot about rhythm and music games here on the podcast, so we kind of thought we'd refocus ourselves a little bit and tell you guys what we're really all about, and that's just kind of general video gaming, what gamers really want to know about.

01:15.749 --> 01:21.452
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you're a DDR fan, don't get upset, because we're still going to talk about rhythm and music games plenty on this show.

01:21.492 --> 01:26.934
[SPEAKER_02]: When we find out that a lot of stuff is going on, new stuff in the world, we will bring it to you as soon as we find out.

01:26.974 --> 01:27.394
[SPEAKER_02]: But for now...

01:28.106 --> 01:28.627
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:47.816 --> 01:48.517
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't.

01:48.697 --> 01:50.859
[SPEAKER_03]: I usually delete all the stupid games off of my cell phone.

01:51.199 --> 01:54.041
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen some of those games you can download on the cell phone, though?

01:54.161 --> 01:55.122
[SPEAKER_03]: I have Bejeweled on my phone.

01:55.643 --> 01:57.144
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we were talking about this a little bit last week.

01:57.164 --> 02:01.007
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember we were talking about it on the last podcast about the Chinese cell phone games that you can get?

02:01.027 --> 02:02.408
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just like, you can get Life Force.

02:03.409 --> 02:04.490
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can get them in Japan.

02:05.160 --> 02:06.921
[SPEAKER_03]: I want that Final Fantasy VII game.

02:07.341 --> 02:07.702
[SPEAKER_02]: Heck yeah.

02:07.742 --> 02:08.722
[SPEAKER_03]: The Turks game.

02:08.762 --> 02:09.263
[SPEAKER_02]: Heck yeah.

02:09.583 --> 02:16.688
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, the best thing we get, you know, I have Impossible Mission, which was, don't get me wrong, one of the greatest Commodore 64 games of all time.

02:17.068 --> 02:18.569
[SPEAKER_02]: But it sucks on the cell phone.

02:18.609 --> 02:19.529
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't even see the room.

02:19.549 --> 02:21.571
[SPEAKER_03]: They do have Gradius for the US phone, I found out.

02:21.631 --> 02:24.032
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not for anything, I think, that we have.

02:24.733 --> 02:27.655
[SPEAKER_03]: And they, um... Shoot, there was, uh...

02:28.880 --> 02:31.641
[SPEAKER_03]: A game that I was thinking when you said Impossible Mission.

02:31.661 --> 02:35.163
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking they should put Incredible Crisis on the cell phone.

02:35.483 --> 02:36.083
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be cool.

02:36.223 --> 02:38.224
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it would have all the music on there, though.

02:38.784 --> 02:40.025
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows what technology is.

02:40.505 --> 02:41.485
[SPEAKER_02]: So, any other games?

02:41.665 --> 02:41.946
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it?

02:41.986 --> 02:42.466
[SPEAKER_02]: Just cell phones?

02:43.006 --> 02:43.586
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really it.

02:43.986 --> 02:44.227
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

02:44.507 --> 02:44.807
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair enough.

02:44.887 --> 02:45.727
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what have you been up to?

02:46.027 --> 02:47.428
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been playing my PSP.

02:48.849 --> 02:49.329
[SPEAKER_00]: What did I do?

02:49.489 --> 02:49.709
[SPEAKER_00]: I was...

02:50.285 --> 03:01.249
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly playing Wipeout Pure only because my boss was borrowing the Twisted Metal head-on because he doesn't have any games for his, so I felt bad for him, so I loaned him that for a few days.

03:02.189 --> 03:04.130
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been playing Wipeout Pure, and it's pretty fun.

03:05.430 --> 03:08.771
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I hated Wipeout, and I don't know.

03:09.852 --> 03:12.073
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice right now while I have one game.

03:12.113 --> 03:16.314
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting more games coming in on Monday, so I'll have Luminous and Ridge Racer finally.

03:17.556 --> 03:24.242
[SPEAKER_00]: and then 512 megabyte memory sticks so I can put all my pirated episodes of Robot Chicken on there.

03:24.823 --> 03:25.603
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my favorite.

03:27.064 --> 03:34.391
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the other game I got was Zookeeper for the DS and I can see why I didn't get it before because it's kind of annoying.

03:34.611 --> 03:38.954
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I actually had to turn the background music off on it because it was that annoying.

03:38.974 --> 03:40.716
[SPEAKER_00]: It just repeated like every five seconds.

03:40.796 --> 03:41.837
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just awful.

03:42.805 --> 03:49.447
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I've been checking out Zookeepers, too, since you picked it up, which basically, Zookeeper is just bejeweled on the DS.

03:49.867 --> 03:50.748
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's pretty.

03:51.008 --> 03:54.249
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, one minor change, the animal theme, and that's about it.

03:54.749 --> 03:55.609
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's basically bejeweled.

03:55.949 --> 04:03.932
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't it feel like one of those games that was really rushed to come out just because there are no other games out on the DS, so they know people would buy it?

04:04.272 --> 04:04.972
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, exactly.

04:04.992 --> 04:05.432
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it is.

04:05.612 --> 04:07.153
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's, like, no depth to it.

04:07.173 --> 04:10.734
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, ooh, it's a game I can pick up, play for a little bit, and I'm done.

04:11.557 --> 04:12.337
[SPEAKER_00]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

04:32.793 --> 04:34.315
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

04:54.397 --> 04:56.999
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I played it for about five minutes, and I was like, I've played this game before.

04:57.359 --> 04:59.181
[SPEAKER_02]: Bejeweled 2 is cooler than Zookeeper.

04:59.441 --> 05:01.082
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't they put Bejeweled 2 on the DS?

05:01.142 --> 05:03.244
[SPEAKER_02]: At least you got, like, the super jewels and things like that.

05:03.804 --> 05:09.129
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's got, like, a better theme, whereas Zookeeper gets... You know, the bleeps and bloops.

05:09.169 --> 05:10.230
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like Atari 2600.

05:10.510 --> 05:11.070
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hella annoying.

05:11.511 --> 05:17.235
[SPEAKER_02]: The other game I got to check out this week, thanks to Loki, actually, managed to snag me a copy of Doom 3 on the Xbox.

05:17.856 --> 05:21.559
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, you know, I have to admit, I wasn't really interested in Doom 3 at all.

05:21.739 --> 05:21.939
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

05:22.600 --> 05:27.543
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's hard because I really liked Doom and Doom 2 when they were out years ago.

05:27.883 --> 05:31.264
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember how they were like the first, like, first-person games?

05:31.284 --> 05:34.546
[SPEAKER_02]: They were kind of like this sequel to Wolfenstein in a way.

05:34.666 --> 05:37.768
[SPEAKER_02]: In a way, not really, but they were kind of like the next evolution of Wolfenstein.

05:37.828 --> 05:39.589
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Wolfenstein with ramps.

05:40.129 --> 05:41.089
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not really ramps, actually.

05:41.109 --> 05:41.990
[SPEAKER_02]: And then multiplayer.

05:42.657 --> 05:43.558
[SPEAKER_02]: Which was really cool.

05:43.998 --> 05:48.542
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you remember, if you ever created your own maps in Wolfenstein, it's very 2D.

05:48.882 --> 05:52.324
[SPEAKER_02]: Wolfenstein is really, it's like you take a 2D level and you put yourself in it.

05:52.685 --> 05:53.545
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember doing that.

05:53.966 --> 05:55.507
[SPEAKER_02]: Doom was very 3D.

05:55.587 --> 05:57.548
[SPEAKER_03]: And it had the Wolfenstein level.

05:58.529 --> 05:58.889
[SPEAKER_02]: It did.

05:58.909 --> 06:00.931
[SPEAKER_03]: You had to do the level skip code, but you could get there.

06:00.951 --> 06:05.014
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it was level 40-something.

06:05.174 --> 06:05.634
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember.

06:05.654 --> 06:08.857
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of the levels that Wolfenstein was actually in Doom.

06:08.897 --> 06:09.337
[SPEAKER_02]: It was cool.

06:09.457 --> 06:09.597
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.100
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

06:27.782 --> 06:29.684
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually pleasantly surprised with Doom 3.

06:30.505 --> 06:33.027
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quite more to it than I thought.

06:33.147 --> 06:35.809
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like the other Dooms where you just jump in, start shooting.

06:36.029 --> 06:37.130
[SPEAKER_02]: Even Halo is a lot like that.

06:37.190 --> 06:42.215
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, Halo has its big cinematic opening, but it's kind of really just jump in, start shooting.

06:43.444 --> 06:50.686
[SPEAKER_03]: But Halo 2, anyway, has where you can take the vehicles and completely abandon the game and fly around and go places you're not supposed to go.

06:50.806 --> 06:53.467
[SPEAKER_02]: There's plenty of differences between Halo 2 and Doom 3.

06:53.667 --> 06:59.789
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to try and compare the two, but I'm just kind of, you know, I think a lot of times because they're first-person shooters, we kind of inadvertently compare them.

07:00.149 --> 07:00.790
[SPEAKER_02]: Doom 3 Doom 2 Doom 3

07:25.214 --> 07:26.054
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really scary.

07:26.074 --> 07:30.356
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like bodies hanging from ceilings and zombies that jump up from the floor and stuff.

07:30.396 --> 07:31.416
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty freaky.

07:31.736 --> 07:32.696
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to see this.

07:32.776 --> 07:33.356
[SPEAKER_03]: I really do.

07:33.376 --> 07:34.317
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to show it to you.

07:34.337 --> 07:34.657
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty cool.

07:34.677 --> 07:35.877
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't it on PC as well?

07:36.077 --> 07:36.157
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

07:36.197 --> 07:40.338
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually started on PC, but Xbox has... I think I have it somewhere hanging around my house.

07:40.538 --> 07:43.599
[SPEAKER_02]: The cool thing about Doom 3 on Xbox is it has the Xbox Live stuff in it.

07:43.779 --> 07:46.100
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I don't know anybody else with the game, so I can't play anybody yet.

07:46.140 --> 07:48.901
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and they'll see the other thing is that it runs on your...

07:49.361 --> 07:50.061
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

08:10.467 --> 08:40.113
[SPEAKER_02]: but like in this one you can actually walk up to it and then zoom in and it seamlessly is zooming in and you actually can see like a number pad that you have to punch in an access code to get through the door it's crazy pretty insane yeah it's a high level of detail I like it anyway so that's pretty much my gaming well that and there's like these panels that you walk around that like have video playing it's like an actual like video talking about the whole facility welcome to Mars and don't get killed welcome to Recall

08:41.417 --> 08:43.358
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's start off with some gaming news tonight.

08:43.378 --> 08:46.881
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll actually talk about another game that's on its way towards Xbox.

08:47.521 --> 08:52.124
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an update for an old classic comic strip, and this was a game of one time as well.

08:52.144 --> 08:52.724
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember this one.

08:52.945 --> 08:54.365
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember Spy vs. Spy?

08:55.666 --> 08:58.688
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, I have Spy vs. Spy comics in my bathroom.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.509
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, Mad Magazine, right?

09:00.529 --> 09:01.530
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it spun off.

09:01.750 --> 09:04.372
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was an old school Commodore 64 game too.

09:04.392 --> 09:05.232
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it came out on the NES.

09:05.252 --> 09:06.433
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was on the NES as well.

09:06.513 --> 09:08.334
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember there were like three versions on the Commodore.

09:08.354 --> 09:09.035
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an awesome game.

09:09.577 --> 09:10.257
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

09:28.664 --> 09:30.265
[SPEAKER_02]: You go across the games, 12 levels.

09:30.626 --> 09:32.627
[SPEAKER_02]: There's weapons, booby traps, and gadgets.

09:32.687 --> 09:35.289
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of sounds very similar to the other one.

09:35.689 --> 09:39.752
[SPEAKER_02]: The other cool thing about Spy vs. Spy, though, and I always like it when game companies do this, it's a $19.99 title.

09:39.792 --> 09:42.655
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're starting this off as a budget title.

09:42.675 --> 09:46.577
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a reason why it's $19.99, because you get what you pay for, people.

09:46.898 --> 09:49.760
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, we paid $19.99 for Katamari Damacy.

09:49.800 --> 09:50.901
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.

09:51.041 --> 09:51.661
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's right.

09:51.761 --> 09:52.402
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what?

09:52.422 --> 09:54.763
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of those exceptions to the rule, okay?

09:54.844 --> 09:57.826
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought Technic Beat, which came out at the same time, was very cool as well.

09:58.286 --> 09:59.327
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a 29 game.

09:59.987 --> 10:00.467
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, Rob.

10:00.487 --> 10:02.188
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Spy vs. Spy, okay?

10:02.388 --> 10:04.229
[SPEAKER_00]: Spy vs. Spy for the NES sucked.

10:04.389 --> 10:10.212
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a fond place in my heart for the Spy vs. Spy Commodore games, because I was a kid when those were out, and it was great.

10:10.472 --> 10:11.413
[SPEAKER_00]: Horrible reviews.

10:11.613 --> 10:13.814
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even think anyone actually wanted to review this game.

10:13.874 --> 10:14.694
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll tell you, though.

10:14.734 --> 10:18.236
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's the thing that might make you go kind of, uh, maybe this is a crappy game.

10:18.276 --> 10:18.837
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't know yet, though.

10:19.217 --> 10:21.138
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 2 version got canceled.

10:21.918 --> 10:22.699
[SPEAKER_02]: They decided not to do it.

10:24.339 --> 10:25.340
[SPEAKER_02]: Seems very interesting, hmm?

10:26.736 --> 10:29.638
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I would have to get Spy vs. Spy just because.

10:29.658 --> 10:31.299
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.

10:31.339 --> 10:34.880
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be the just because factor, and I'd get it for 30% off anyway.

10:34.900 --> 10:36.021
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone should send me a free one.

10:36.401 --> 10:37.001
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that idea.

10:37.262 --> 10:38.302
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just get it for cheap.

10:38.742 --> 10:44.505
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a free copy of Spy vs. Spy you want to send us, togo, T-O-G-O, at orangelaunchradio.com.

10:44.525 --> 10:46.206
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, you could really write us about anything.

10:46.506 --> 10:48.087
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll read whatever emails you've got to send us.

10:51.027 --> 10:52.728
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk old school consoles for a minute.

10:52.788 --> 10:54.408
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is really cool, this story.

10:54.428 --> 10:56.509
[SPEAKER_02]: It talks about the Atari 2600.

10:57.489 --> 11:00.570
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you believe there's still new Atari 2600 news after all these years?

11:01.110 --> 11:05.331
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, people are still making ROMs for the 2600.

11:05.411 --> 11:06.091
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you got it.

11:06.191 --> 11:06.692
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it is.

11:06.852 --> 11:07.772
[SPEAKER_02]: Retro Redo.

11:07.852 --> 11:11.393
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a 24-hour video game programming contest held...

11:11.809 --> 11:12.870
[SPEAKER_02]: Ninja Garden Ninja Garden

11:29.989 --> 11:30.850
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

11:47.443 --> 11:48.323
[SPEAKER_02]: But, okay, whatever.

11:49.444 --> 11:53.746
[SPEAKER_02]: The prize is that this game, Ninja Garden, is going to be included in the next version of that.

11:54.026 --> 11:54.526
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, pretty cool.

11:54.546 --> 11:56.707
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of the, you know, new secret game.

11:56.988 --> 12:03.651
[SPEAKER_00]: Truth be told, people, you could actually probably pull a chip out of one of those and actually flash any ROMs you want on there, but... Whatever.

12:03.711 --> 12:06.412
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that we encourage you to break your warranty and do that.

12:06.472 --> 12:08.593
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, come on, I'm working on a $20 item.

12:08.633 --> 12:09.153
[SPEAKER_02]: Woo!

12:09.173 --> 12:10.074
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta replace that one.

12:10.314 --> 12:12.275
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they releasing that thing with the whip handling?

12:13.408 --> 12:14.429
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not.

12:14.769 --> 12:18.231
[SPEAKER_02]: You know it's not the old wood panel style we had way back in the day.

12:18.251 --> 12:19.152
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the kind that I have.

12:19.192 --> 12:20.273
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the cheap plastic.

12:20.313 --> 12:21.574
[SPEAKER_03]: The third release one, right?

12:21.614 --> 12:21.914
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

12:22.534 --> 12:24.796
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't even know if it exactly looks like one of those.

12:27.758 --> 12:30.680
[SPEAKER_02]: From old system to very new system, PSP.

12:31.140 --> 12:33.302
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of folks were saying, oh, it sold great.

12:33.322 --> 12:35.163
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the best system ever in sales.

12:35.223 --> 12:37.405
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people were saying, disappointing.

12:38.129 --> 12:45.336
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the first week sales figures are out now, and the PSP sold 600,000 units in its first week.

12:46.838 --> 12:48.880
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what that equates to?

12:49.000 --> 12:50.722
[SPEAKER_02]: About $150 million.

12:51.362 --> 12:53.905
[SPEAKER_03]: Good, then Sony will be able to pay that $90 million off.

12:54.606 --> 12:56.768
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, in that lawsuit we were talking about.

12:57.549 --> 12:58.790
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see, we'll see about that one.

12:59.711 --> 12:59.971
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

13:01.393 --> 13:05.755
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, in other handheld gaming news, Nintendo's got this DS.

13:06.015 --> 13:07.936
[SPEAKER_02]: You might have heard of this new game on the way for the DS.

13:07.976 --> 13:09.177
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Electroplankton.

13:09.717 --> 13:10.958
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you've heard about this at all.

13:11.698 --> 13:12.239
[SPEAKER_00]: They have like...

13:13.632 --> 13:15.233
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought there was a website for this or something.

13:33.368 --> 13:35.950
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're doing an interesting promotion here, Nintendo is.

13:35.990 --> 13:43.757
[SPEAKER_02]: What they're going to be doing, they're actually going to have like an aquarium exhibition hall at this Tokyo show from April 8th to 14th.

13:44.177 --> 13:46.420
[SPEAKER_02]: Entrance is free and you get to see the whole thing.

13:47.060 --> 13:54.947
[SPEAKER_02]: And the cool thing about this is Nintendo's going to be giving away only 10 limited edition electroplankton DS units.

13:55.948 --> 13:56.649
[SPEAKER_02]: Should be interesting.

13:57.734 --> 14:03.436
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the looks of it, it pretty much looks exactly like a normal DS, except there's this little sticker on it.

14:04.277 --> 14:05.377
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be an engraving, though.

14:05.617 --> 14:06.858
[SPEAKER_00]: An engraving, whatever.

14:07.098 --> 14:08.519
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the lighting.

14:08.619 --> 14:12.480
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyways, it's just... It's actually what that is.

14:12.520 --> 14:13.401
[SPEAKER_02]: It is an engraving.

14:13.461 --> 14:15.582
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the original electroplankton artwork.

14:16.162 --> 14:16.282
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

14:16.946 --> 14:20.468
[SPEAKER_02]: So whoever's going to get that, they're going to put it on friggin' eBay, and it's going to sell for a lot.

14:20.488 --> 14:20.849
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

14:21.069 --> 14:21.469
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

14:21.849 --> 14:22.209
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

14:22.610 --> 14:29.494
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of Nintendo, you know how we have in San Francisco, now we, you know, we based our show out of Sacramento, so San Francisco's just a drive up the road.

14:29.934 --> 14:33.897
[SPEAKER_02]: And in San Francisco, they have the official Sony PlayStation Store at the Sony Metron.

14:33.917 --> 14:35.158
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been there before, right, DarkSakura?

14:35.338 --> 14:35.878
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

14:35.938 --> 14:36.519
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun, huh?

14:36.559 --> 14:37.419
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big geek place.

14:37.659 --> 14:38.040
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

14:38.060 --> 14:39.561
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole Metron is just geek central.

14:39.761 --> 14:39.961
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.

14:39.981 --> 14:40.821
[SPEAKER_03]: And with overpriced games.

14:41.142 --> 14:41.922
[SPEAKER_02]: And overpriced food.

14:42.282 --> 14:44.024
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, it's fun, you know.

14:44.364 --> 14:44.564
[SPEAKER_02]: Well...

14:45.262 --> 14:49.665
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're on the other coast, there's a gaming company that's going to be doing something similar for you guys.

14:49.825 --> 14:52.808
[SPEAKER_02]: In New York City, New York City!

14:53.268 --> 14:53.808
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a rope!

14:54.149 --> 14:58.832
[SPEAKER_02]: Rockefeller Center will soon be home to the Nintendo World Store.

14:59.332 --> 15:04.396
[SPEAKER_02]: A two-story complex, Mario, Zelda, Nintendo, you think of it.

15:04.536 --> 15:08.559
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the location will host the brand new Pokemon Center.

15:10.020 --> 15:10.961
[SPEAKER_02]: Joy, joy, joy.

15:12.145 --> 15:14.966
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we leave our kids there, put them in Pokeball?

15:15.346 --> 15:16.406
[SPEAKER_03]: People are going to do that anyway.

15:16.566 --> 15:17.426
[SPEAKER_00]: You know it's going to happen.

15:18.187 --> 15:19.227
[SPEAKER_03]: Go play, kid!

15:19.767 --> 15:27.269
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really surprised they're not doing it in Seattle since the Nintendo headquarters is just north of Tacoma.

15:27.329 --> 15:28.970
[SPEAKER_02]: That is kind of surprising to me.

15:29.090 --> 15:32.431
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it's fun to try stuff on the other coast, too.

15:32.471 --> 15:35.692
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we get spoiled here on the West Coast sometimes with all these technology things.

15:36.272 --> 15:37.352
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not complaining.

15:37.712 --> 15:38.952
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew up in Alabama.

15:39.273 --> 15:40.093
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not complaining.

15:41.718 --> 15:42.398
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say, you know what?

15:42.418 --> 15:47.241
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also over, well, not exactly on the East Coast, but the West Coast by the, you know, Microsoft.

15:47.261 --> 15:49.143
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they've got to have their, you know.

15:49.203 --> 15:49.683
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

15:49.903 --> 15:50.543
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the thing.

15:50.603 --> 15:57.168
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, if Sony has chosen San Francisco and Nintendo has chosen New York, where's Microsoft going to go?

15:58.849 --> 15:59.829
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully Alaska.

15:59.849 --> 16:00.610
[SPEAKER_02]: Seattle.

16:00.890 --> 16:02.191
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully Alaska.

16:02.311 --> 16:02.791
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm kidding.

16:03.171 --> 16:03.531
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kidding.

16:04.832 --> 16:05.553
[SPEAKER_03]: The South Pole.

16:05.913 --> 16:06.854
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably L.A.

16:06.874 --> 16:07.874
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

16:08.114 --> 16:08.495
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

16:08.835 --> 16:09.195
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

16:10.556 --> 16:10.736
[SPEAKER_02]: Now,

16:11.092 --> 16:13.853
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, I know you're a big fan of Namco, the company, right?

16:14.194 --> 16:15.474
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you such a fan of Namco?

16:15.534 --> 16:16.195
[SPEAKER_03]: I worked for them.

16:16.755 --> 16:18.476
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so you still have a lot of company loyalty?

16:19.496 --> 16:21.898
[SPEAKER_03]: I had the coolest uniform shirt ever.

16:22.338 --> 16:24.519
[SPEAKER_03]: It was red and black and had Pac-Man on it.

16:26.540 --> 16:27.681
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the coolest thing about Namco?

16:28.921 --> 16:30.002
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything Tekken related.

16:30.322 --> 16:30.602
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

16:31.342 --> 16:36.145
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what's actually coming out on the PlayStation 2 is Nam Collection.

16:37.129 --> 16:38.510
[SPEAKER_02]: They've actually pushed this back, though.

16:38.530 --> 16:42.232
[SPEAKER_02]: It was going to come out in Japan on June 2nd, but it actually got pushed back a little bit.

16:42.613 --> 16:43.753
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the NAMM collection?

16:43.813 --> 16:46.695
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be five classic PlayStation games.

16:46.996 --> 16:53.820
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be Ridge Racer, Ace Combat 2, Kelowna, Mr. Driller, and Tekken.

16:54.560 --> 16:55.241
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

16:55.461 --> 16:56.021
[SPEAKER_03]: Klonoa.

16:56.542 --> 16:57.182
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, Klonoa.

16:57.642 --> 16:59.844
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is like one of the most awesome platformers ever.

16:59.984 --> 17:00.164
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

17:01.134 --> 17:08.059
[SPEAKER_02]: The compilation is also going to have a gallery mode and movies with tips and tricks on how to get through the game.

17:08.380 --> 17:13.323
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember on the old PlayStation they had the N-A-M-C-O, all that libraries.

17:13.784 --> 17:17.046
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like they're doing that all over again, but now for the newer games.

17:17.086 --> 17:20.569
[SPEAKER_02]: Because PlayStation, believe it or not, is getting to be like 10 years old.

17:21.229 --> 17:22.030
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of sad.

17:22.050 --> 17:27.354
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this sounds like a desperate attempt at money.

17:28.240 --> 17:29.581
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, isn't everything?

17:29.601 --> 17:30.141
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, come on.

17:30.501 --> 17:32.522
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to play Tekken, go buy Tekken 5.

17:32.742 --> 17:34.803
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, because you have no Tekken in there.

17:34.983 --> 17:35.364
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

17:35.644 --> 17:41.867
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just like, okay, it's like how Nintendo released those retro games that are available on the Advance.

17:42.187 --> 17:44.228
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the games you can buy is Metroid.

17:45.074 --> 18:10.784
[SPEAKER_00]: But hello, spend ten more dollars and you could get Metroid Zero Mission Which has Metroid in it Yeah And is a great game outside of that Or all those other like classic games that you could actually download via Animal Crossing That too, a lot of games that you could just get on Animal Crossing It's just ridiculous, but hey folks that buy, you know, the Nintendo products They like to shell out money for the same thing over and over and over again, so why not?

18:11.824 --> 18:14.425
[SPEAKER_02]: Retro holds a place in many people's hearts though, it really does

18:15.967 --> 18:40.477
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio to go to show we're not here just to talk about games all the time because you know if we talked about games all the time we'd have no time to go clubbing so what we're here to do as well as we're here to better your life and who better to give you some advice on how to better your life than our very own Dark Sakura with her advice column and Jamie what are you going to tell the kids about tonight

18:42.549 --> 18:46.171
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this one I think is very, very useful.

18:46.911 --> 18:48.672
[SPEAKER_03]: One that everybody needs to know.

18:49.592 --> 18:50.072
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's this?

18:50.472 --> 18:51.913
[SPEAKER_03]: How to treat a bullet or knife wound.

18:52.233 --> 18:52.733
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, okay.

18:53.374 --> 19:01.857
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, it always happens when you get in one of those heated soul caliber battles where someone ends up getting cut in the end.

19:02.477 --> 19:03.518
[SPEAKER_02]: So, this is good to know.

19:04.638 --> 19:06.019
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you ready?

19:06.619 --> 19:06.999
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

19:07.700 --> 19:11.021
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one, do not immediately pull out any impaled objects.

19:11.724 --> 19:12.486
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

19:22.745 --> 19:23.605
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, unfortunately.

19:47.216 --> 19:55.123
[SPEAKER_03]: Control the bleeding by using a combination of direct pressure, limb elevation, pressure points, and tourniquets in that order.

19:55.644 --> 19:56.945
[SPEAKER_03]: Immobilize the injured area.

19:57.485 --> 20:05.112
[SPEAKER_03]: Using splints and dressings to immobilize an injured area helps protect from further injury and maintain clots that have begun to form.

20:05.212 --> 20:08.815
[SPEAKER_03]: Dress the wound and strive to prevent infection.

20:09.696 --> 20:11.598
[SPEAKER_03]: That means dump a bottle of vodka on their legs.

20:12.757 --> 20:15.238
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, five, get medical attention as soon as possible.

20:15.638 --> 20:17.358
[SPEAKER_03]: But of course, you know what I always say in the end.

20:17.498 --> 20:17.718
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes?

20:17.979 --> 20:19.479
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get shot, stupid!

20:20.079 --> 20:20.439
[SPEAKER_03]: Duck!

20:23.020 --> 20:24.941
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much for that lovely piece of advice.

20:25.081 --> 20:28.962
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's, people, if bullets are flying, freaking hide.

20:30.022 --> 20:33.023
[SPEAKER_02]: If somebody runs a gun, or if somebody pulls a gun, you run!

20:33.323 --> 20:33.903
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a little bitch.

20:34.143 --> 20:34.723
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

20:34.923 --> 20:36.484
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, you could usually end up getting shot in the back.

20:38.384 --> 20:39.245
[SPEAKER_02]: You won't care!

20:39.265 --> 20:40.485
[SPEAKER_02]: Be careful.

20:42.116 --> 20:47.400
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of getting shot, you remember how the Godfather, the movie, had a game come out pretty recently?

20:48.140 --> 20:49.721
[SPEAKER_02]: They made like the Godfather game.

20:50.501 --> 20:55.244
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, did you know that the Godfather game did not have everybody's blessing in coming out?

20:55.304 --> 20:57.866
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, some people are quite irritated about this game coming out.

20:58.186 --> 21:00.507
[SPEAKER_02]: You know who one of the folks is that's pretty irritated about it?

21:01.548 --> 21:06.131
[SPEAKER_02]: Francis Ford Coppola, who made the damn movies, is not happy about this.

21:07.515 --> 21:17.618
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, he's actually expressed his displeasure with Paramount Pictures because they ended up selling the rights out.

21:18.378 --> 21:23.280
[SPEAKER_02]: He's actually going to talk about this on an AMC show called Sunday Morning Shootout.

21:23.300 --> 21:24.000
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what he says.

21:24.600 --> 21:25.500
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew nothing about it.

21:25.780 --> 21:27.841
[SPEAKER_02]: They never asked me if I thought it was a good idea.

21:28.181 --> 21:29.141
[SPEAKER_02]: They use the characters.

21:29.321 --> 21:29.981
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone knows.

21:30.262 --> 21:32.262
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for the next hour, they shoot and kill each other.

21:32.362 --> 21:35.283
[SPEAKER_02]: I had absolutely nothing to do with this game, and I disapprove.

21:36.218 --> 21:38.980
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, that's why they didn't tell you about it, because it's going to suck.

21:39.461 --> 21:39.901
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

21:41.002 --> 21:42.403
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you'd actually approve that.

21:43.704 --> 21:44.364
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the whole point.

21:44.384 --> 21:46.266
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's never going to work out.

21:46.846 --> 21:47.767
[SPEAKER_00]: But, hey, that's all right.

21:47.847 --> 21:49.689
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have a nice Grand Theft Auto clone.

21:52.271 --> 21:53.211
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Phantasy Star.

21:54.032 --> 21:55.473
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of you guys have played this out there.

21:55.493 --> 21:57.815
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you used to play this a while ago, DarkSakura.

21:58.075 --> 21:58.355
[SPEAKER_02]: A bit.

21:58.435 --> 21:59.456
[SPEAKER_02]: I've played it on and off.

21:59.496 --> 22:03.619
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like I can never keep going with Phantasy Star online enough to go past, like, level 10 or 11.

22:05.134 --> 22:05.934
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

22:35.467 --> 22:42.051
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully it will have nothing to do with Phantasy Star Online Volume 3, which was like the card game.

22:42.811 --> 22:43.792
[SPEAKER_03]: Which was the suck.

22:44.012 --> 22:46.313
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully it'll go back to the regular one.

22:46.353 --> 22:47.213
[SPEAKER_03]: We need Blue Burst.

22:48.534 --> 22:56.018
[SPEAKER_02]: The single player campaign is expected to clock in at roughly 40 hours of play with three planets to explore and new enemies to fight.

22:56.398 --> 23:00.220
[SPEAKER_02]: Gamers no longer have to go around on foot because there's actually going to be vehicles in the game.

23:01.861 --> 23:03.622
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course there's going to be the online mode.

23:03.882 --> 23:04.243
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

23:04.623 --> 23:04.963
[SPEAKER_02]: Has to be.

23:07.196 --> 23:10.237
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I never really got into the old school Phantasy Star games.

23:10.297 --> 23:11.257
[SPEAKER_02]: I really wish I had.

23:11.597 --> 23:16.299
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm curious, does Phantasy Star Online actually have anything in common with the older Phantasy Stars?

23:17.119 --> 23:22.861
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some things, but there's like the Newman class, you know, or race.

23:22.941 --> 23:26.802
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the Meseta, there's all the, you know, currency.

23:26.942 --> 23:28.363
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so some little things.

23:28.783 --> 23:30.023
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got some things, yeah.

23:30.603 --> 23:32.264
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know...

23:33.473 --> 23:36.914
[SPEAKER_03]: They released the Sega Ages Collection in the States, right?

23:37.294 --> 23:37.774
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?

23:37.994 --> 23:39.574
[SPEAKER_03]: And it had the Phantasy Star.

23:39.594 --> 23:41.655
[SPEAKER_03]: You know the one that I brought over that was all in Japanese?

23:41.675 --> 23:42.175
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I remember that.

23:42.195 --> 23:45.476
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the Fantasy Zone you brought over, right?

23:45.516 --> 23:51.437
[SPEAKER_03]: I brought over Fantasy Zone and Space Harrier, but we also have Phantasy Star.

23:51.957 --> 23:52.477
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, very cool.

23:52.517 --> 23:53.377
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have this in the U.S.

23:53.417 --> 23:53.557
[SPEAKER_02]: now.

23:53.777 --> 23:53.977
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

23:54.097 --> 23:54.597
[SPEAKER_02]: I was not aware.

23:54.697 --> 23:56.738
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's like a collection now that you can get for like $30.

23:56.778 --> 23:56.878
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

23:57.731 --> 23:58.931
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

24:21.167 --> 24:22.649
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely coming out in the U.S.

24:22.690 --> 24:27.898
[SPEAKER_02]: because they have launched the North American website for Final Fantasy VII Advent Children.

24:27.958 --> 24:31.143
[SPEAKER_02]: It's na.square-enix.com DVD FF7AC

24:36.471 --> 24:41.892
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's coming out, and you can actually download the US trailer on here, and it's definitely going to be coming out.

24:41.932 --> 24:42.712
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the interesting thing.

24:43.072 --> 24:47.033
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just out on DVD, but also will be coming out UMD.

24:47.353 --> 24:47.953
[SPEAKER_00]: UMD, yep.

24:48.693 --> 24:49.373
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.

24:49.593 --> 25:03.496
[SPEAKER_00]: Also announced, I'm not sure if you're going to cover this, but Crisis Core, which is another, it's going to be a PSP game that's going to be tying in with the whole, I forget what they're calling it, like the whole series of Final Fantasy VII stuff.

25:03.976 --> 25:04.376
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

25:04.416 --> 25:05.156
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the one with Vincent?

25:05.899 --> 25:07.240
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's something else.

25:07.280 --> 25:08.221
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many of them now.

25:08.241 --> 25:13.286
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like for forever, people were saying, you know, oh, there needs to be a sequel to Final Fantasy VII.

25:13.326 --> 25:13.826
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there needs to be.

25:13.866 --> 25:15.587
[SPEAKER_02]: And now suddenly it's like we're getting too many.

25:16.028 --> 25:17.129
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't keep track of them all.

25:19.815 --> 25:21.777
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so hopefully soon we'll be seeing this.

25:21.817 --> 25:23.998
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, not going to have a theatrical release.

25:24.058 --> 25:26.000
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only going to be a DVD and UMD release.

25:26.080 --> 25:35.167
[SPEAKER_02]: But what is interesting about this is that they actually announced in Japan, Squeenix announced that they're going to be doing a special limited edition version.

25:35.587 --> 25:36.868
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, that's the way to go.

25:36.928 --> 25:40.851
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you release the regular one and they release a special edition for $20 more.

25:40.871 --> 25:44.795
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, they haven't really said what's going to be in this special edition.

25:44.835 --> 25:45.235
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just...

25:45.856 --> 25:49.359
[SPEAKER_02]: Bonus merchandise not available in the normal edition.

25:50.580 --> 25:53.302
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, how specific.

25:54.123 --> 25:56.865
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully we'll get more details on that in the next few weeks.

25:58.706 --> 26:01.028
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly tonight, I thought we could close on a story.

26:01.589 --> 26:10.936
[SPEAKER_02]: Funny enough, even though I said we're not going to be putting the rhythm of music games in our podcast intro anymore because we talk about all sorts of other stuff, I actually have a DDR story to talk about at the end here.

26:10.976 --> 26:11.697
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that ironic?

26:13.538 --> 26:14.479
[SPEAKER_03]: A little too ironic.

26:15.342 --> 26:16.202
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like rain.

26:16.382 --> 26:17.603
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

26:18.083 --> 26:19.183
[SPEAKER_02]: West Virginia.

26:20.064 --> 26:23.885
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got the Public Employees Insurance Agency.

26:24.545 --> 26:34.209
[SPEAKER_02]: What they're doing, they've recruited 85 children to take part in a study aimed at reducing costs associated with covering obesity claims for its clients.

26:35.249 --> 26:42.872
[SPEAKER_02]: What the study is doing is it's using DDR and it's trying to see if there's a possibility to encourage weight loss via DDR at an early age.

26:44.607 --> 26:45.508
[SPEAKER_02]: P.E.I.A.

26:46.749 --> 26:51.632
[SPEAKER_02]: Health Promotions Manager Nydia Henderson says, Today's kids are tomorrow's members.

26:51.792 --> 26:54.794
[SPEAKER_02]: Obesity claims last year cost us $77 million.

26:55.174 --> 26:56.715
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to curtail these costs.

26:57.255 --> 26:58.336
[SPEAKER_02]: The study is budgeted at $60,000.

26:58.977 --> 27:00.257
[SPEAKER_02]: And hey, guess what?

27:00.277 --> 27:05.641
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're one of the 85 fat kids in this program, you get a free copy of a game system.

27:06.283 --> 27:08.945
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR, and a DDR dance pad.

27:09.105 --> 27:10.166
[SPEAKER_02]: All complimentary for this.

27:10.887 --> 27:20.394
[SPEAKER_02]: But, as a trade-off, if you're in the six-month program, you will have to play the game for a certain amount of time every day, and you have to wear a meter and do all these reports and stuff as well.

27:20.514 --> 27:21.715
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also have to sell your soul.

27:22.956 --> 27:24.878
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, you know, small text there.

27:24.958 --> 27:25.859
[SPEAKER_02]: To the Konami gods.

27:27.120 --> 27:32.264
[SPEAKER_02]: The insurance agency is also going to be using $10,000 to try the game out at 20 public schools.

27:33.164 --> 27:33.785
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.

27:35.074 --> 27:42.476
[SPEAKER_02]: All this DDR news about how, you know, it's just taken off out there and people are using it for all these weight loss things and yet, still no new arcade mix.

27:42.936 --> 27:43.597
[SPEAKER_02]: Still not happening.

27:44.217 --> 27:44.797
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, darn.

27:44.817 --> 27:46.678
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're just forgetting something, aren't they?

27:46.778 --> 27:48.698
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's just like something's forgotten.

27:48.758 --> 27:54.580
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like that whole fan base that helped DDR get big in the first place just suddenly, you know, forgotten.

27:55.100 --> 27:57.861
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, we do get the home mixes with the eye toy and all that.

27:57.921 --> 27:58.921
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that, yeah.

27:59.041 --> 28:00.722
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but, you know, no new arcade things for you.

28:01.851 --> 28:04.214
[SPEAKER_03]: And the arcade mix would get me totally back in the arcade.

28:04.254 --> 28:10.219
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be there in a heartbeat, especially if it was by the folks that did Ultramix 2, which is by far the best DDR home release they've done, in my opinion.

28:10.920 --> 28:11.520
[SPEAKER_02]: But what do I know?

28:11.560 --> 28:14.363
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just some dumb podcast guy on the internet.

28:15.384 --> 28:17.566
[SPEAKER_02]: We're internet celebrities!

28:18.307 --> 28:24.452
[SPEAKER_02]: From all us internet celebrity podcasters to you guys, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio To Go.

28:25.033 --> 28:27.275
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Sakura, your closing thought for us tonight.

28:28.675 --> 28:31.438
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can't be an athlete, be an athletic supporter.

28:43.373 --> 28:44.933
[SPEAKER_00]: And now Xbox signed up with a marketing campaign.

28:44.953 --> 28:47.454
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, you know, they're all trying to one-up each other.

28:47.474 --> 28:48.214
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what happens.

28:48.234 --> 28:48.594
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

29:10.598 --> 29:12.359
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyways.

29:12.540 --> 29:18.324
[SPEAKER_02]: And my final thought is the Froger contains potassium benzoate.

29:20.065 --> 29:20.466
[SPEAKER_03]: Special.

29:20.846 --> 29:21.927
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's going to do it.

29:21.967 --> 29:24.569
[SPEAKER_02]: See you guys next time here on the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition.

29:25.630 --> 29:29.212
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition.

29:29.513 --> 29:36.498
[SPEAKER_01]: This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com See you next update.
