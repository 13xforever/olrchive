Why am I a pirate?

05:12.140 --> 05:16.300
Arrrrr! I don't know, because you pirate-like things. Because you're always chasing the booty.

05:16.300 --> 05:19.540
That's why.

found the sound clip we wanted to play very badly for you guys last week we

06:10.100 --> 06:14.280
played it about a year ago which is a little bit of a hint as to what it is

06:14.280 --> 06:18.260
we were talking about a little something something last week and we finally found

06:18.260 --> 06:22.300
the sound clip of it to play tonight so it's it's wonderful so we're gonna play

06:22.300 --> 06:26.860
it doesn't have me saying anything you know no it's actually not a sound clip

06:26.860 --> 06:31.140
of you. It's a sound clip of somebody not even on this show, but that's what makes it

06:31.140 --> 06:37.060
funny. We'll discuss what that is in a little bit, don't worry. I'll give you a hint during

06:37.060 --> 06:45.060
break. Alright, speaking of break, let's get to it. In this break, some random music. We'll

06:45.060 --> 06:50.060
start it off with a little bit of French counting. So if you want to learn how to count to three,

06:50.060 --> 06:54.060
just listen very carefully to the lyrics of the song. We'll be back after this with more

06:54.060 --> 06:56.060
Orange Lounge Radio. Enjoy!

07:24.060 --> 07:41.060
Can you be your fantasy, give me ecstasy

09:13.060 --> 09:15.060
Tell me why

09:22.060 --> 09:27.060
Let me go, let me go Let me go, let me go

09:27.060 --> 09:29.060
There's only one

10:27.060 --> 10:39.060
I see it all day, and they make me wonder

10:39.060 --> 10:41.060
It's overloaded

10:41.060 --> 10:55.060
Good, good, baddle, baddle, bitch, I move out

10:55.060 --> 10:55.560
C'mon

11:55.060 --> 12:12.380
Don't don't sleep on me, please Don't don't sleep on me

12:12.380 --> 12:19.380
I'm gonna take you away And let it show you the way

12:19.380 --> 12:26.380
We didn't go in the skyline With the speed

12:26.380 --> 12:33.380
Fly away, fly away I'm gonna take you away

12:33.380 --> 12:40.900
And even though it's not love, it's just fear

12:40.900 --> 12:49.460
Fly away from the sea, feeling love instantly

12:49.460 --> 12:54.020
Until we reach eternity

12:54.020 --> 13:23.060
Hi Ho, Karmit D. Fogg here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is

13:23.060 --> 13:27.060
Brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

13:27.060 --> 13:32.060
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

13:32.060 --> 13:37.060
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 138.

13:37.060 --> 13:40.060
In progress here on this lovely April night.

13:40.060 --> 13:43.060
Hope you guys had an interesting April Fool's Day.

13:43.060 --> 13:46.060
I know there were a lot of interesting pranks that were played out there by some various websites.

13:46.060 --> 13:51.060
Of course, one of the biggest sites I'm sure most of us who listen to this program visit once in a while,

13:51.060 --> 13:56.540
in a while the DDR freak did a joke but it wasn't really a joke which was kind

13:56.540 --> 14:01.500
of funny they went in the groove for a day they're gonna turn to in the groove

14:01.500 --> 14:05.360
freak but it frickin wasn't a joke like they actually added an in the groove

14:05.360 --> 14:08.820
section so I thought that was kind of funny like kind of with the jokes on you

14:08.820 --> 14:12.180
type thing but that made me giggle how long did you know that you guys were

14:12.180 --> 14:14.580
doing that because you're a moderator over there so you get special privileges

14:14.580 --> 14:19.200
huh you know given the why am I so loud I don't know you're given the issue with

14:19.200 --> 14:24.120
last year. I just sort of sat back and let everybody else do their thing and I was like

14:24.120 --> 14:29.520
yeah I'm not even gonna. Seriously like last year was a lot and I couldn't believe some

14:29.520 --> 14:33.880
of the response the joke was getting on DDR4 because people were like oh this is this sucks

14:33.880 --> 14:39.600
compared to last year. Last year was funny. And I'm going like okay last year was like

14:39.600 --> 14:44.920
too much. I'm like you cannot outdo what they did last year because what happened last year

14:44.920 --> 14:51.640
was over the top. Last year, the best part about it was actually getting everything that

14:51.640 --> 14:59.640
led up to April Fool's Day. Because we were all becoming power hungry, egomaniac. It was

14:59.640 --> 15:07.560
basically wrestling drama. Basically. It was like you all got to be WWE members for a minute.

15:07.560 --> 15:12.840
We were all like, screw y'all. We are all admins and we are going to just take over

15:12.840 --> 15:21.840
the whole page. And then, all chaos broke loose on New Year's.

15:21.840 --> 15:26.840
See, my brain's all, I swear it's Daylight Savings Time if I can win my head.

15:26.840 --> 15:29.840
Oh, I have a lot to say about Daylight Savings Time in a little bit.

15:29.840 --> 15:35.840
But seriously though, last year was so much fun this year, I'm like, nothing will ever

15:35.840 --> 15:40.840
be what last year was, so I just sat back and let it happen. Like, this is your puppy.

15:40.840 --> 15:45.200
Well, here's the thing, everybody's saying that, you know, it doesn't top last year and

15:45.200 --> 15:49.600
it wasn't funny and it wasn't creative and it was too obvious, but I think what people

15:49.600 --> 15:55.820
don't get is that the actual joke was not the fact that DDR Freak was going to turn

15:55.820 --> 15:57.080
into In The Groove Freak.

15:57.080 --> 16:02.000
The joke was is that it was something that they really were going to add to the site

16:02.000 --> 16:05.640
and keep, so it was kind of like one of those not a joke jokes.

16:05.640 --> 16:06.640
Gotcha twice!

16:06.640 --> 16:07.640
Kinda.

16:07.640 --> 16:08.640
I don't know how to put it.

16:08.640 --> 16:09.640
Yeah.

16:09.640 --> 16:13.920
Now, everybody knows I was a very vocal critic of last year's joke.

16:13.920 --> 16:15.320
I did not enjoy last year's joke.

16:15.320 --> 16:19.000
I thought it was way over the top, not necessary.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.960
So I much prefer this year's joke.

16:21.960 --> 16:26.360
I'll tell you what, part of the joke was getting the angry reactions, though.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.440
That was part of the good thing.

16:28.440 --> 16:29.440
No offense.

16:29.440 --> 16:31.960
No, that's all right.

16:31.960 --> 16:36.040
But last year's joke was stupid, so I'm glad that this year's joke was a little more tame

16:36.040 --> 16:37.040
and kind of funny.

16:37.040 --> 16:38.040
Yeah, good thing we didn't do anything.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.040
Yeah, I know.

16:39.040 --> 16:42.000
We decided to stay out of the April Fools thing, because you know, I don't think April

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Fools is that funny at all.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
No.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Exactly.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
Boy caught it.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Uh-huh.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
So anyway, where was I?

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Oh, yes.

16:50.000 --> 16:54.320
Oh, we're going to play that, because we might have some new people listening to the show.

16:54.320 --> 16:58.720
You're going to hear us repeat a lot of this stuff through the month of April, because

16:58.720 --> 17:02.160
we got that nomination for Broadcaster of the Year for the Best of Life 365.

17:02.160 --> 17:06.720
So thank you, hugs and kisses to Life 365, thank you.

17:06.720 --> 17:12.440
We feel very honored and, frankly, somewhat surprised that we got nominated for that,

17:12.440 --> 17:13.440
you know?

17:13.440 --> 17:14.440
Most unlike...

17:14.440 --> 17:15.440
I'm not surprised at all.

17:15.440 --> 17:16.440
I mean, after all...

17:16.440 --> 17:17.440
What?

17:17.440 --> 17:18.440
No, seriously.

17:18.440 --> 17:19.440
You've got...

17:19.440 --> 17:23.060
You have my gorgeous voice.

17:23.060 --> 17:28.160
We have our violent and angry young man here.

17:28.160 --> 17:29.680
And then we have you.

17:29.680 --> 17:33.160
Yeah, and then there's the gay.

17:33.160 --> 17:36.200
And then we have the gay.

17:36.200 --> 17:41.520
I don't know, I'm not surprised at all. We put enough work into this, we deserve our

17:41.520 --> 17:49.520
kudos, dammit. Well thank you for being so humble about everything, I appreciate it.

17:49.520 --> 17:56.800
We are fucking celebrities. Okay, the internet loves us.

17:56.800 --> 18:01.560
Well in all reality I'm going to come down to, you know, planet earth here. I don't know

18:01.560 --> 18:04.800
where Jamie's at right now. I'm going to come down to planet earth here.

18:04.800 --> 18:13.360
you guys but it's just funny to see everybody that's nominated for

18:13.360 --> 18:17.200
broadcaster the year and you've got some really frickin fantabulous stations

18:17.200 --> 18:21.160
folks that are probably I don't know this for sure I'm speculating here but

18:21.160 --> 18:24.960
I'm guessing there's one at least one or two stations in there where that is what

18:24.960 --> 18:32.120
they do is like 365 so to be nominated amongst that is like awesome I don't

18:32.120 --> 18:34.760
even know how to put it and it's our listeners who helped us get there so you

18:34.760 --> 18:39.160
know kisses to you guys you know I have to make a mention to the chat room yes

18:39.160 --> 18:45.320
no we are not going to have Roberto or Jaime thank you yes no we are not going

18:45.320 --> 18:51.360
to be an espanol we will be in Esperanto now if now if we wanted to do the April

18:51.360 --> 18:55.480
Fool's thing which we don't having the station in Spanish one day would have

18:55.480 --> 19:00.720
been pretty funny so we got to write these down for next year if we wish is

19:00.720 --> 19:06.080
incredibly funny because I don't speak any Spanish except for el telefono es

19:06.080 --> 19:13.200
en fuego which translates to the telephone is on fire don de esta el

19:13.200 --> 19:17.360
bano that's the only one I know where is the bathroom because you know if you're

19:17.360 --> 19:20.400

19:20.400 --> 19:27.080
Tijuana that's a phrase you need to know all right anyway well that back to the

19:27.080 --> 19:30.400
sound clip. I was going to play this. Ah, screw the clip. You might remember we were

19:30.400 --> 19:35.160
actually nominated for Best of the Life 365 last year in the category of Most Unlikely

19:35.160 --> 19:40.120
to Hear on AM-FM radio, which we got nominated in again this year, which is very cool. So

19:40.120 --> 19:46.080
there's, you know, two places to nominate us. However, something very funny happened.

19:46.080 --> 19:50.240
Three of us, all three of them, myself, Dark Sakura, and Loki, we all went to the awards

19:50.240 --> 19:56.940

got Pokemon right okay that's all we need screw orange line screw I plan to

20:51.760 --> 20:58.140
sit at I plan okay this is my plan for the award ceremony this year this year

20:58.140 --> 21:03.540
uh-huh it's sitting at the damn table with a bottle of tequila doing shots

21:03.540 --> 21:07.420
through the whole thing okay now listen though very careful I'm

21:07.420 --> 21:10.860
going to play a little clip of this again listen very carefully after they

21:10.860 --> 21:14.700
announced Pokemon radio which was the last one they read they start to open

21:14.700 --> 21:20.680
the envelope listen very carefully to what happens in the background radio PIRN

21:20.680 --> 21:30.080
in that I you distinctly hear Loki back there going hey hey this doesn't fly hey

21:30.080 --> 21:37.640
lady I wasted a tank of gas to get here I'm drunk

21:37.640 --> 21:45.440
say my name bitch say my name I think you and I were the only ones who drank

21:45.440 --> 21:50.400
no I think Loki didn't you kick back a beer or two no you were driving you had

21:50.400 --> 21:55.720
to drive. Somebody had to be responsible. Well I don't know why Loki was saying hey,

21:55.720 --> 22:02.060
he wasn't driving. I think I had like a Sapporo, a Heineken, and Guinness. I'm like, let's

22:02.060 --> 22:11.600
have the international alcohol today. So then of course, just as a reminder. Oh yeah, Orange

22:11.600 --> 22:17.040
Lounge was nominated as well. They didn't make it to the envelope, sorry about that.

22:17.040 --> 22:28.400
we we printed them separately so they might have. I had no idea what that excuse was. And the winner goes to Fluffertracks, Vanyavich. Yay, hooray for the porno radio station.

22:28.400 --> 22:33.240
Hooray for them. Okay, yeah, great. So just as a reminder, we didn't win last year,

22:33.240 --> 22:39.200
so we'd really appreciate your vote this year. So head on over to www.orangetownstrator.com

22:39.200 --> 22:43.080
and it has a link so you can go to the ballot on line 365 and vote. So I hope you

22:43.080 --> 22:47.960
all take a second to do that. And maybe this year we will be remembered on the envelope.

22:47.960 --> 22:55.440
This year, we need to make a scene. They need to realize that it is stations like us who

22:55.440 --> 22:59.220
make the money for them. Oh wait, you're up, oh I'm sorry, Planet

22:59.220 --> 23:04.800
Earth's down here and you're up here again. No seriously, if it wasn't for us and the

23:04.800 --> 23:09.080
fact that people keep wanting to listen to us and we have to pay them more money to enable

23:09.080 --> 23:14.360
our listeners to enjoy us do you think that maybe the fact that we somehow

23:14.360 --> 23:18.040
actually got nominated broadcaster years a little bit of an apology for that last

23:18.040 --> 23:24.520
year like oh shit we better make it up to them somehow they better have a table

23:24.520 --> 23:32.680
separated for us well but this is a weird thing with rose petals and like

23:32.680 --> 23:45.580
some nice champagne and waffles I demand waffles here's the crazy thing we

23:45.580 --> 23:48.700
actually have quite a few listeners in the Bay Area where this show's award

23:48.700 --> 23:52.780
ceremony is going to take place a lot of people have been asking me if they can

23:52.780 --> 23:58.540
go we have totally have got to carry the totally have to make up the choreography

23:58.540 --> 24:03.380
for, um, yeah, choreography for, like, something, something sort of, like, you know, the West

24:03.380 --> 24:08.860
Side Story, just come in, just start, just like, all just, like, come in and just, like,

24:08.860 --> 24:11.420
you know, prance around you, that'd be fucking hilarious.

24:11.420 --> 24:15.620
Actually, we will be taking official sign-ups on our website pretty soon for the official

24:15.620 --> 24:20.340
Orange Lounge Radio Entourage. The folks that will be going with us to the award show, they

24:20.340 --> 24:23.340
have to have 20 bucks, because it costs 20 bucks to go to the show, and you have to have

24:23.340 --> 24:27.660
your own way over there or something, fine, because we, we don't have a big van or anything,

24:27.660 --> 24:31.260
make sure you can find a ride to the hotel where this is gonna be at and I

24:31.260 --> 24:35.520
forget where it is I'll look it up later in the show and give it to you guys but

24:35.520 --> 24:38.840
we do need people to actually be carrying the red carpet so that when

24:38.840 --> 24:43.480
Jamie, Loki, myself arrive they can roll it out so we can walk on it and walk in

24:43.480 --> 24:50.720
that is awesome and it needs to be crushed velvet do you think I'm kidding

24:50.720 --> 24:55.800
the sad thing is ladies and gentlemen she's not alright anyway so more to come

24:55.800 --> 25:06.960
on that a little later so I don't want to keep dragging this segment out for now

25:06.960 --> 25:12.720
I'm going to return to this because life 365 now we know you're listening yeah we

25:12.720 --> 25:17.840
know there's you snubbed us last year now that we are really huge and we are

25:17.840 --> 25:24.800
bigger this year we are we are bigger than we have play on DDR free radio yeah

25:24.800 --> 25:28.200
And I'd say we're bigger than the Pope, but that would be in very poor taste this week,

25:28.200 --> 25:29.600
so we're not bigger than that right now.

25:29.600 --> 25:35.080
But we're bigger than, um, um...

25:35.080 --> 25:36.080
We are bigger than Goatsee.

25:36.080 --> 25:37.840
Yeah, we're bigger than Goatsee.

25:37.840 --> 25:38.840
I agree.

25:38.840 --> 25:39.840
We are.

25:39.840 --> 25:41.680
We are bigger than big.

25:41.680 --> 25:46.200
And so you have, you better get out the chapstick because you're going to be kissing our ass

25:46.200 --> 25:48.200
so much this year.

25:48.200 --> 25:53.100
Oh my gosh, you know how much, do you know how many fellow broadcasters are listening

25:53.100 --> 26:00.100
to this for the first time going, what a bunch of stuck up bitches. See if they get our vote.

26:00.480 --> 26:05.360
Jamie really is a polite individual. If you meet her in person, she's a big fluffy hug

26:05.360 --> 26:11.280
monster when you meet her. She just, you know. I really am cute and adorable, aren't I? Don't

26:11.280 --> 26:16.960
push it. Alright, anyway. Seriously, I'm glad we got the nominations this year. Yes, I'm

26:16.960 --> 26:22.400
very glad too. I was surprised. I'm not bitter at all about last year. It's an excuse for

26:22.400 --> 26:28.020
me to drink more expensive alcohol and have a good time.

26:28.020 --> 26:33.380
Encouraging our fellow broadcasters to continue to give the finger to conventional radio.

26:33.380 --> 26:34.380
Exactly.

26:34.380 --> 26:36.380
That's what this is really all about, is giving the finger to conventional radio.

26:36.380 --> 26:42.260
We're about protecting our first amendment rights and saying, hey, regular radio, y'all

26:42.260 --> 26:43.260
can kiss my ass.

26:43.260 --> 26:44.260
That's right.

26:44.260 --> 26:48.300
We are about, we want to be able to say fucking shit on the air and we are all about, you

26:48.300 --> 26:50.700
know, our right to, you know, say whatever we want.

26:50.700 --> 26:53.820
If we want to tell dick and fart jokes for three hours, that's what we're going to do.

26:53.820 --> 26:55.100
That's practically what we do anyway.

26:55.100 --> 26:56.100
I know.

26:56.100 --> 26:57.100
Anyway.

26:57.100 --> 27:02.020
And we've been doing this for two and a half years.

27:02.020 --> 27:03.260
Moving on.

27:03.260 --> 27:06.620
Let's start off tonight's show, but outside of that little rant, we usually start off

27:06.620 --> 27:10.620
the show with a little bit of, how was your week, how was your day, so let's back up a

27:10.620 --> 27:11.620
little bit.

27:11.620 --> 27:13.580
DarkStalker, how was your week, how was your day?

27:13.580 --> 27:16.820
Busy as all get out, oh my god.

27:16.820 --> 27:22.900
know the week before was spring break so now that spring break's over my ass is

27:22.900 --> 27:27.900
back in having to do all this crap for school and my teachers have actually

27:27.900 --> 27:32.360
taken a bit of mercy on us although I did skip my art class on Wednesday

27:32.360 --> 27:37.380
because I was just worn out from running at the gym but I'm full swing in my

27:37.380 --> 27:42.500
training schedule as well training for the mud run so I can get all dirty and

27:42.500 --> 27:51.200
icky and ogle at the Marines, hurr. So I ran Monday and Wednesday, worked out a

27:51.200 --> 27:58.580
little bit elsewhere in the week, did a lot of shopping. We paid off all of our

27:58.580 --> 28:07.920
bills, hahaha, such a good feeling. Really this week's just been me either going to

28:07.920 --> 28:14.340
work, going to the gym, or doing school crap, or working on my fan project, or working on

28:14.340 --> 28:20.300
stuff for the radio station, which I've actually been coming up with a few ideas.

28:20.300 --> 28:23.980
I'm going to be coming up with a few more.

28:23.980 --> 28:27.060
And Lemon Lime Jump, that's cool that your sister's a Marine, my little brother's a Marine

28:27.060 --> 28:29.860
too.

28:29.860 --> 28:37.700
So it's just really been pretty busy.

28:37.700 --> 28:42.340
Oh, yeah, I did though hang out yesterday with iguana girl and Tia

28:43.060 --> 28:46.020
We went shopping. We did girly stuff all day

28:47.880 --> 28:51.260
Did y'all go get makeovers and pedicures and you know what no

28:53.140 --> 28:55.140
Baby and tried on jeans, okay

28:55.780 --> 28:58.420
For like an hour and a half. Yeah, I could do that and I'm not a girl. I

28:59.300 --> 29:01.300
like clothes and

29:01.340 --> 29:07.380
It's just it's very frustrating right now because I'm in between sizes. So nothing I try on fit worth a damn

29:07.380 --> 29:12.420
I have a question. Why is it that pants sizes for, you know, for girls, um, they're always

29:12.420 --> 29:20.420
like, you know, 14, 16, 18, where are the juniors? Oh, I never knew that. So that means

29:20.420 --> 29:24.820
I could go to Target. This is cool. I can actually shop in the junior section at Target

29:24.820 --> 29:30.780
now. That makes me very happy because then I can get stuff cheap now and I can go to

29:30.780 --> 29:36.620
thrift stores too. Thrift store shopping is awesome. I went to thrift store the other

29:36.620 --> 29:38.540
They had a bunch of crap.

29:38.540 --> 29:41.380
I almost bought some vinyl pants though.

29:41.380 --> 29:42.380
That's awesome.

29:42.380 --> 29:45.380
But they were cut really funny.

29:45.380 --> 29:52.560
And then I went today, because it was a stupid daylight savings time, my ass was up until

29:52.560 --> 29:57.880
4 o'clock, which I was up until 5.30 on Friday, so it's all good.

29:57.880 --> 30:04.740
And then I went out to lunch with Dan, and we went to the Eastern buffet because I had

30:04.740 --> 30:09.320
a free meal over there. Which is a Chinese food buffet, right? Yeah, it used to be really

30:09.320 --> 30:13.320
gross but they were pretty good today. That's good. I had a good dim sum. And then I went

30:13.320 --> 30:19.540
to, we went to Dimple, which is, it's a local record store chain used in new stuff. They

30:19.540 --> 30:27.540
usually overprice all their old DVDs. Excuse me. But we found like the motherload of Atari

30:27.540 --> 30:32.860
games. It was awesome. In fact, I've got a list here of what we found. For anyone who

30:32.860 --> 30:44.540
is a classic gaming nut like me and my man are. We got the Star Trek Star Fleet Academy

30:44.540 --> 30:55.000
thing that was on the Atari 2600 back in the day. And we also picked up, you know I have

30:55.000 --> 31:00.040
it right in front of me can't believe them okay we also picked up junior

31:00.040 --> 31:05.920
pac-man frog or two and journey escape which was actually the band journey now

31:05.920 --> 31:10.360
I remember the journey video game in the arcades like back in the 80s it was

31:10.360 --> 31:14.400
awesome because it actually had like MIDI style don't stop believing and open

31:14.400 --> 31:17.800
arms and stuff that played in the background but what is journey escape on

31:17.800 --> 31:21.240
the Atari was it the same thing you haven't even played it in but it's one

31:21.240 --> 31:24.200
of the rare you need to check it out because I want to know if it's just like

31:24.200 --> 31:29.160
the arcade game or if it's like a whole different adventure well I also was

31:29.160 --> 31:35.040
digging around for to replace some CDs that I've since lost and I was off

31:35.040 --> 31:40.540
looking for actually specifically today I was looking for blur CDs but as I was

31:40.540 --> 31:47.280
walking down to the register this tape caught my eye from the side and it

31:47.280 --> 31:51.560
turned out to be a gorillas promo DVD I'm not DVD but a VHS and gorillas is

31:51.560 --> 31:56.440
band you've really been getting into lately right yes and and what is don't

31:56.440 --> 32:00.320
give me that no no I'm just let me give you let me warm up my eyes a little bit

32:00.320 --> 32:06.520
Oh precious dark sacro what is the charm of the gorillas no I seriously what is

32:06.520 --> 32:12.260
it because it's like it's like half art half music half fandom which is three

32:12.260 --> 32:16.120
halves but I don't really indescribable just go to the website and you will be

32:16.120 --> 32:23.500
lost for hours digging through the studio. All right. I don't have enough

32:23.500 --> 32:29.680
time in the show to go into it so I won't. Just read my live journal. All

32:29.680 --> 32:33.320
right, fair enough. Speaking of live journal, we have a Orange Lounge live

32:33.320 --> 32:37.120
journal community. It's www.livejournal.com slash users slash

32:37.120 --> 32:41.800
Orange Lounge. All one word. Nice plug. No problem. And I haven't really plugged our

32:41.800 --> 32:45.320
chat room tonight either so let me give that a shout out. www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com

32:45.320 --> 32:53.000
click on chat. Loki, how was your week? How was your day? My week's been all over

32:53.000 --> 32:59.880
the place. Well, let's see, starting with Monday. Monday was kind of eh, it didn't

32:59.880 --> 33:04.840
really do anything. Tuesday, they finally announced that I got the job at my

33:04.840 --> 33:09.080
company, so now I'm actually game sales now with a nice bonus and pay raise, so

33:09.080 --> 33:14.120
that was cool. Congratulations. And so now I'll be selling games and that kind of

33:14.120 --> 33:21.100
stuff so that'd be cool then also let's see what else happened then Wednesday

33:21.100 --> 33:26.100
nothing really much actually you fast forward to about Friday Friday went saw

33:26.100 --> 33:38.100
Sin City that was awesome then yesterday I went and got a PSP because I just have

33:38.100 --> 33:42.080
to have a PSP to mess around with so that was kind of cool got wiped out pure

33:42.080 --> 33:48.600
and twisted metal head on and then I hit a car and that sucked that was kind of

33:48.600 --> 33:52.360
the down point of the day it didn't do any damage to the car really I mean

33:52.360 --> 33:56.600
other than some paint scrapes I looked at my car there's a little bit of a bent

33:56.600 --> 34:00.560
part on next to the headlight but I mean it didn't even break the headlight or

34:00.560 --> 34:05.240
anything and the bent parts just like ever so slightly and I mean you

34:05.240 --> 34:09.800
honestly looking at it you wouldn't even notice and so you know I had to call my

34:09.800 --> 34:13.400
insurance company and do all that crap so that's just suck but honestly I don't

34:13.400 --> 34:16.320
think anything's gonna happen cuz I mean they've been lowering my insurance you

34:16.320 --> 34:22.080
know for like the last I don't even know how many years and you know didn't do

34:22.080 --> 34:29.440
any damage to my car so now we're all good and then what else then yesterday

34:29.440 --> 34:36.960
played some clue because that's awesome and today after you know a short recess

34:36.960 --> 34:42.600
of you know not having them for a while I got the Sunday headache again but it's

34:42.600 --> 34:46.920
kind of fun though today with my PSP because I'm actually researching for the

34:46.920 --> 34:51.360
future for our website PSP access you know special page IRC that kind of crap

34:51.360 --> 34:55.440
so I actually got on well of course no one in our chats can be able to see it

34:55.440 --> 34:59.700
because it's in our mod for us but I got on and actually made a post on orange

34:59.700 --> 35:03.960
lounge radio with a PSP that's kind of amazing and the way now for those who

35:03.960 --> 35:09.120
don't know the way this has been done is there's actually on wipeout pure that

35:09.120 --> 35:15.280
game there's a downloadable content link on the actual main menu there and what's

35:15.280 --> 35:18.880
gonna happen later on once they activate it is you're gonna be able to download

35:18.880 --> 35:24.680
new maps new textures etc but that's not available right now so you know because

35:24.680 --> 35:29.280
the big community that buys PSPs you know a lot of them are geeks they went

35:29.280 --> 35:34.360
and packet sniffed the web page so they found out how it was connecting or where it was

35:34.360 --> 35:40.440
connecting to. And so now all you do in your PSP when you set it up is you actually set

35:40.440 --> 35:44.400
up a proxy server so basically you put an IP address that you want to connect to and

35:44.400 --> 35:50.180
it will connect to that certain directory or whatever. And so basically you can make

35:50.180 --> 35:54.960
a web page that has a bunch of links on it and like a browser input thing and you can

35:54.960 --> 35:58.920
actually connected to websites that way and I mean this is being covered on

35:58.920 --> 36:02.800
slashdot and gadget a bunch of different websites so you can find out more about

36:02.800 --> 36:06.920
it on there but the new thing that they just started with PSP IRC and that you

36:06.920 --> 36:11.200
actually can connect to IRC right now it's only one channel they can connect

36:11.200 --> 36:14.900
to but they've got like a little mini keyboard on there so it's pretty cool so

36:14.900 --> 36:20.320
you're gonna see a lot happening with this probably even before e3 but I'm

36:20.320 --> 36:25.960
sure they're going to release a browser for it eventually. Now, I've been hearing a lot

36:25.960 --> 36:29.360
of folks that are picking up a PSP. What they're actually doing with it is they're using the

36:29.360 --> 36:35.200
memory stick to actually put other things onto their PSP, such as pornography, but in

36:35.200 --> 36:39.640
more practical senses, their MP3 collections and things of this sort, so they can actually

36:39.640 --> 36:44.420
use their PSP as kind of like an iPod replacement, basically. A lot of people are now saying,

36:44.420 --> 36:49.800
F the iPod, because I can pick up a PSP and play MP3s on the go, correct? Correct, and

36:49.800 --> 36:55.800
And hell, if you're spending 250 bucks on a PSV, you might as well fucking get your money's worth, that's what I say.

36:55.800 --> 37:03.800
Cause, I mean, honestly, when I was looking for games and stuff, I was like, eh, you know, Wipeout, the other Wipeout games I've really hated.

37:03.800 --> 37:07.800
I mean, I honestly hate Wipeout, and the only reason I bought Wipeout is connected to the internet.

37:07.800 --> 37:11.800
Now, I do, I have been playing Wipeout, and I actually kind of like it now.

37:11.800 --> 37:14.800
But, I don't know, there's a few gripes I have.

37:14.800 --> 37:20.240
First off, I don't have any dead pixels, so that's all good.

37:20.240 --> 37:23.200
Second thing, my background's pink.

37:23.200 --> 37:27.160
And now I realize that all the ones I've seen on the internet

37:27.160 --> 37:28.440
have been blue or green.

37:28.440 --> 37:31.840
Well, I read online today, they change with the months.

37:31.840 --> 37:32.880
They change colors.

37:32.880 --> 37:35.400
So that's why it's pink.

37:35.400 --> 37:36.320
I couldn't figure it out.

37:36.320 --> 37:38.320
I thought it was special or something, but apparently not.

37:38.320 --> 37:43.680
April is the month of the Cherry Tree Viewing Festival in Japan.

37:43.680 --> 37:47.760
I thought they were just trying to say that, you know, that I got girly PSP.

37:47.760 --> 37:52.000
Anyways, so, um, yeah, I got that in Twisted Metal head-on.

37:52.000 --> 37:57.720
Twisted Metal head-on is exactly like Twisted Metal 2, just a little, you know, graphic upgrade.

37:57.720 --> 38:01.040
Now, I like the PSP, the only thing that bugs me is the analog stick.

38:01.040 --> 38:05.280
That thing is so uncomfortable, it just, it doesn't work for me.

38:05.280 --> 38:09.640
I mean, it would've been nice if they had it above the, um, crosspad.

38:09.640 --> 38:12.520
But other than that, it's been pretty cool.

38:12.520 --> 38:15.400
I'm actually hoping to get some more games for it later on.

38:18.400 --> 38:22.920
I've also had fun finding open Wi-Fi networks by my house.

38:22.920 --> 38:25.000
Apparently, there's some neighbors of ours that don't

38:25.000 --> 38:29.080
like to password protect their internet, so I just jumped.

38:29.080 --> 38:31.720
The only problem is I can only jump on it outside because the

38:31.720 --> 38:33.000
signal's not that strong.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.760
So I've been browsing the web out on our porch in the cold

38:36.760 --> 38:44.640
and rain, but it's quite fun. So, all you folks out there, be sure to password protect

38:44.640 --> 38:48.240
your internet or else you're going to have people jumping on with their PSPs.

38:48.240 --> 38:52.140
Now, a question I was going to ask you before you were kind of talking about how folks are

38:52.140 --> 38:57.120
accessing the PSP networks and everything. What is the probability, since folks are loading

38:57.120 --> 39:00.440
MP3s and videos and stuff, of us, and I know you're kind of looking into this, but I'm

39:00.440 --> 39:04.160
kind of curious how far away we are from seeing this, you know how we do our podcasts we do

39:04.160 --> 39:09.200
every week where we have the 25 to 30 minute extra show that we do via the podcast. It's

39:09.200 --> 39:12.600
not rehashed material, it's a whole separate thing, so if you want to check that out, just

39:12.600 --> 39:17.480
go to orangehouseradio.com, click on it to go. But, what is the possibility of folks

39:17.480 --> 39:23.560
being able to download that directly onto their PSP? Do we know yet?

39:23.560 --> 39:27.460
Right now, I haven't been able, I haven't tried downloading anything. I don't think

39:27.460 --> 39:33.640
you can. I would imagine it's probably possible you might not be able to download it, maybe

39:33.640 --> 39:39.240
you view it. PSP browsing is kind of slow. I mean, it's actually pretty slow. That's

39:39.240 --> 39:45.520
the only problem. If you want to get any good, you know, speed out of it, you need to disable

39:45.520 --> 39:50.100
the, there's a Wi-Fi power save mode on there, and you need to go under your power save options

39:50.100 --> 39:54.340
and actually disable that, and it will browse the internet faster. But, man, if you stream,

39:54.340 --> 39:59.400
like, if you try to download some of the other things, it's going to take forever. I mean,

39:59.400 --> 40:04.640
I don't think you can do it. Maybe streaming media like our website, or not our website,

40:04.640 --> 40:11.400
but our actual like live station they might be able to pick up. But I don't think downloading

40:11.400 --> 40:16.240
a podcast would work. The live station might be kind of difficult too because you have

40:16.240 --> 40:22.180
to have that extra hurdle of accessing Live 365 and all that. I don't know. I don't know.

40:22.180 --> 40:25.000
Hopefully they'll find something because that would be neat to have Orange Lounge on your

40:25.000 --> 40:28.720
PSP I don't know if I had a PSP I think it's pretty cool but we can create a

40:28.720 --> 40:32.740
special edition of our podcast that's like a really really low bit rate or

40:32.740 --> 40:36.280
something we didn't think of something you know I haven't tried connecting to

40:36.280 --> 40:42.000
live 365 that might be interesting to try out because it's all Java I think so

40:42.000 --> 40:46.480
the only thing that really doesn't work on it is frames and I know if you've

40:46.480 --> 40:51.280
visited our website you've seen how on the side there there's a little like a

40:51.280 --> 40:55.840
forum you know topics the most recent topics that have been posted and they

40:55.840 --> 41:00.480
kind of scroll up along the PSP they scroll left so it's a little weird you

41:00.480 --> 41:03.800
know I don't think life is if I would work is because the player when you

41:03.800 --> 41:07.480
actually launch the station and I think most you guys are listening to station

41:07.480 --> 41:11.640
probably have this it actually pops up in a new window so and I don't think PSP

41:11.640 --> 41:14.840
supports pop-ups at least I hope it doesn't or you know you could get

41:14.840 --> 41:17.800
pop-ups from almost any side out there and suddenly you'll have spyware all

41:17.800 --> 41:22.440
over your PSP. But because the player is in a pop-up, I don't know if it's gonna be possible.

41:22.440 --> 41:27.360
Now there is the direct access URL you can use, but I think you have, you can only use

41:27.360 --> 41:31.840
it like, I don't remember 365's official rules, but I think you can only use it three times

41:31.840 --> 41:34.600
and then they make you log in. I don't remember, it's been a long time since I've looked at

41:34.600 --> 41:37.960
the rules on that, but.

41:37.960 --> 41:41.880
I'm sure there'll be a work around for it. Yep, already. Here's the other thing that

41:41.880 --> 41:47.680
they do have already that you can do that people are doing, is they call it PSP casting.

41:47.680 --> 41:52.000
It's where you do video, and you set it up with RSS, and then you can download the video

41:52.000 --> 41:58.840
straight to your PSP. That's the other thing. But, so, I mean, hey, right now you can download

41:58.840 --> 42:04.440
the podcast on your home internet and just load it on there. Take a few minutes, you

42:04.440 --> 42:09.200
know. It's probably a lot better anyways. I guess that's something you can do for now.

42:09.200 --> 42:14.480
All right, well, I want to wrap this segment up, so get quickly to me and Angel's weekend

42:14.480 --> 42:18.640
my week and my day were pretty pretty good I had actually really really good

42:18.640 --> 42:22.840
weekend so I'm just very happy went out with some buddies last night we just

42:22.840 --> 42:26.760
kind of went out the club and all that stuff actually played some DDR today at

42:26.760 --> 42:30.720
home several different yeah I was showing DDR to somebody who had not

42:30.720 --> 42:35.520
seen the Xbox mixes yet so double gasps I got to you know play some ultra mix too

42:35.520 --> 42:39.160
I actually worked out I played some 9s I was working up a sweat or something

42:39.160 --> 42:43.640
else that's good exercise other than that you might remember that earlier

42:43.640 --> 42:47.000
this week I don't know if you listen Thursday night show but on Thursday

42:47.000 --> 42:50.640
night's program we were talking about Yoshi's touch and go on the DS which is

42:50.640 --> 42:54.640
a game that I picked up earlier this week because I don't want to spend $300

42:54.640 --> 43:00.240
on a PSP and I don't want to spend $150 on night style just yet but I want to

43:00.240 --> 43:04.960
buy a game to hold me over until I have more money so I decided I'd go to Game

43:04.960 --> 43:08.200
Stop and I was just randomly gonna buy myself a new DS game well the problem

43:08.200 --> 43:12.040
with a Nintendo DS right now although the technology is excellent the DS has

43:12.040 --> 43:17.080
a lot of potential. I would say about 1% of the DS potential is actually being used right

43:17.080 --> 43:21.120
now because there's what, like 12 games out there for the DS right now? So there's really

43:21.120 --> 43:25.580
not a lot. So when I said I wanted to buy a DS game, my choices were pretty limited.

43:25.580 --> 43:29.080
So I finally ended up deciding to pick up this game, Yoshi's Touch and Go, which on

43:29.080 --> 43:32.520
Thursday night's show I just slammed because I did not like the game at all. I thought

43:32.520 --> 43:36.580
it was hard to get into. I thought it was the same, repetitive. But this is the weird

43:36.580 --> 43:41.540
thing. I still have not been able to put this game down. And I don't know if it's because

43:41.540 --> 43:46.220
it's the only DS game that I haven't worn out yet or what but I've still been

43:46.220 --> 43:50.500
playing this game it's very very odd and I like the fact that you can search for

43:50.500 --> 43:53.980
picto chat rooms like I've been just like I was my friend was driving to the

43:53.980 --> 43:56.780
club last night I was actually playing Yoshi's touch-and-go in the car searching

43:56.780 --> 44:00.060
for picto chat rooms trying to see if I could pick up like little kids doing

44:00.060 --> 44:03.220
picto chat in the backseat of a car so I could hop on there and go you know you

44:03.220 --> 44:09.100
suck you know or something but it didn't work so I've been playing Yoshi's touch

44:09.100 --> 44:15.100
And I've also been playing a little bit of Final Fantasy XI, but not so much. I'm trying to cut short the eviction.

44:15.100 --> 44:17.100
I didn't play it all this week.

44:17.100 --> 44:19.100
Well, aren't you special?

44:19.100 --> 44:22.100
I need to help me level.

44:22.100 --> 44:26.100
Well, you're at the point, though, where you gotta party to level.

44:26.100 --> 44:31.100
I do party! I am a party girl! Nobody parties like I do, okay?

44:31.100 --> 44:34.100
Alright, sorry. You gonna party like it's level 99?

44:34.100 --> 45:00.100
I found my Chains of Promothea Discs, which means I'm back on the game.

45:00.100 --> 45:11.700
Anyway, so that was like, uhh, Thursday I guess, um, Tuesday however, I went to school

45:11.700 --> 45:18.900
and went to my class, but only six people showed up, so obviously it got cancelled,

45:18.900 --> 45:24.420
and that sucks, so I'm gonna wait till August and take it all over again, but it's all good.

45:24.420 --> 45:26.860
I can wait, I am patient.

45:26.860 --> 45:36.620
Other than that, I played some DDR this week, yay, met some people over at the place I usually

45:36.620 --> 45:44.420
play at that I hadn't seen in a while, so that was cool, and not much yesterday, went

45:44.420 --> 45:53.540
out and met some people from a game called there, I've talked about this many times over,

45:53.540 --> 46:01.500
But I actually got to meet the people behind their avatar, so it's cool.

46:01.500 --> 46:06.860
I just had a really good weekend, and a really good week.

46:06.860 --> 46:11.580
Not too much to complain about, not too much to talk about really.

46:11.580 --> 46:12.580
Pretty boring.

46:12.580 --> 46:17.980
But hey, at least I can play Final Fantasy XI and a couple other games I've been playing.

46:17.980 --> 46:27.540
Half-Life 2, Cough, Hack, and uh, other stuff, so uh, I guess that's it. Oh, I got Ultra

46:27.540 --> 46:35.820
Mix 2 this week. Hehehe, we must play. What do you think of the DDR Ultra Mix 2? I don't

46:35.820 --> 46:41.980
know why, but uh, my load time sucks. Now, I don't know if that's everyone's cartridge

46:41.980 --> 46:47.420
or just mine. I mean, not cartridge, but disc, rather. I don't know if... You know what I've

46:47.420 --> 46:52.740
noticed is that booting up DDR Ultramix 2 takes forever but once you finally get

46:52.740 --> 46:56.500
in there it's not so bad but it's just the boot up takes a long time it's like

46:56.500 --> 47:01.920
trying to play something on the PSP well I actually thought it was me because you

47:01.920 --> 47:07.660
know Andrew was like why is taking so long what's going on it's not supposed

47:07.660 --> 47:11.580
to be taking this long I'm like oh should we take it back he goes no no I'm

47:11.580 --> 47:15.980
like okay you know not he's not giving me a straight answer so I'm like well

47:15.980 --> 47:20.300
maybe I'll just ask Rob when I get here tomorrow which I'm doing now so that's

47:20.300 --> 47:28.180
cool but I think I do need to get a dual platform pad because it's the converter

47:28.180 --> 47:34.220
I'm using is kind of glitchy yuck I figured I'd try the converter first and

47:34.220 --> 47:39.940
if that didn't work well I would get a dual platform so here we go I'm gonna

47:39.940 --> 47:48.500
have to invest in a dual platform now. Alrighty. What we're gonna do now, let's go to a break,

47:48.500 --> 47:52.860
we'll do some break, we're gonna do some new Beatmania 2DX music, like from 10th and 11th

47:52.860 --> 47:58.980
style on this break, so we're gonna do some music from that. I have a request. I think

47:58.980 --> 48:03.300
I know what you want and it's already in there. That's happy joy stuff. Alright, so we'll

48:03.300 --> 48:08.700
get that. What else are we gonna have when we come back? Skypline! We'll open that up,

48:08.700 --> 48:12.700
So go to www.orangelandsradio.com, click on interact with us if you have something you want to talk about.

48:12.700 --> 48:17.700
We had a request from the chat room to talk about a video game related tour going on this summer.

48:17.700 --> 48:19.700
So we'll talk about that because it's worth mentioning.

48:19.700 --> 48:22.700
And other gaming news when we come back.

48:22.700 --> 48:26.700
So we will be back after this with more Orange Launch Radio.

48:26.700 --> 48:29.700
We're going to start it off with a track from BeatMania 2DX11 style.

48:29.700 --> 48:31.700
This is injection of love

48:59.700 --> 49:01.700
I'm so sad to die

49:01.700 --> 49:04.700
I can't tell you please

49:04.700 --> 49:08.700
I will be playing the other way

49:09.700 --> 49:13.700

55:16.740 --> 55:18.740
Dont be afraid

55:18.740 --> 55:20.740
I know

55:20.740 --> 55:22.740
I know

55:22.740 --> 55:24.740
I know

55:24.740 --> 55:26.740
I know

55:26.740 --> 55:28.740
I know

56:28.740 --> 56:33.740
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting

56:33.740 --> 56:38.740
as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

56:38.740 --> 56:43.740
Um, Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bamani Music and More program. Can we talk about that?

56:43.740 --> 56:46.740
No subject will ever be taboo.

56:46.740 --> 56:50.740
Well, I was thinking maybe we should move, pump up the volume from Tuesday nights?

56:50.740 --> 56:53.740
Except, of course, the subject that was just under discussion.

56:53.740 --> 56:59.740
Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the attack music we play on the station?

56:59.740 --> 57:01.740
I collect your fucking head.

57:02.740 --> 57:04.740
Just like this fucker here.

57:06.740 --> 57:13.740
Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki? The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

57:13.740 --> 57:20.740
Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

57:20.740 --> 57:25.740
Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

57:50.740 --> 57:56.100
And of course, because Jamie had to hear it, Gradius Full Speed by Mr. T in that break

57:56.100 --> 58:01.700
as well, starting it off injection of love.

58:01.700 --> 58:04.900
You know we have a little bit of competition going on tonight with Orange Launch Radio.

58:04.900 --> 58:10.960
Folks are torn between whether they want to listen to Orange Launch Radio or watch WrestleMania.

58:10.960 --> 58:11.960
You know what?

58:11.960 --> 58:12.960
Or watch baseball.

58:12.960 --> 58:13.960
Guilty, guilty, guilty.

58:13.960 --> 58:19.900
Had I had a way to the Bay Area today, I'd be watching WrestleMania.

58:19.900 --> 58:27.000
I don't watch wrestling all year anymore, but WrestleMania is like, wow, it's WrestleMania.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.720
Get to see my hot, sweaty men's in their drama.

58:29.720 --> 58:30.720
Men's?

58:30.720 --> 58:31.720
My men's.

58:31.720 --> 58:32.720
You're men's?

58:32.720 --> 58:33.720
What about the women?

58:33.720 --> 58:34.720
There's women wrestlers too, right?

58:34.720 --> 58:35.720
Don't they get anything?

58:35.720 --> 58:36.720
Yeah, but they're all hoochies now.

58:36.720 --> 58:37.720
They used to...

58:37.720 --> 58:42.280
WrestleMania 19 was the last one that had women that could actually wrestle.

58:42.280 --> 58:43.480
Just because of the one with Trish Stratus.

58:43.480 --> 58:47.360
I just remember Chyna, because who doesn't remember Chyna, especially with real life

58:47.360 --> 58:48.360
and everything.

58:48.360 --> 58:52.360
and then got her butt booted from TNA as all washed up.

58:52.360 --> 58:56.360
I mean, okay, she's really awesome, and I think if she got her, you know, got her shit together,

58:56.360 --> 59:00.360
she'd be all, you know, really cool, but

59:00.360 --> 59:04.360
her time's passed unless she can grab it again.

59:04.360 --> 59:08.360
It's just not the same, and we need, we need more roid girls.

59:08.360 --> 59:12.360
Speaking of surreal life, have you heard about the new season of surreal life?

59:12.360 --> 59:16.360
I mock reality TV.

59:16.360 --> 59:18.660
Come on, didn't you watch the previous one a little bit?

59:18.660 --> 59:19.160
No.

59:19.160 --> 59:19.960
Okay, well...

59:19.960 --> 59:20.460
I...

59:20.460 --> 59:20.960
You should.

59:20.960 --> 59:22.460
It had China in it, and Mini-Me.

59:22.460 --> 59:25.460
I watched the one where they were ranting cattle.

59:25.460 --> 59:27.360
Okay, there you go. So you watched at least one episode.

59:27.360 --> 59:28.660
So you kinda know what the show's about.

59:29.160 --> 59:32.360
And I did watch one episode before the first episode,

59:32.360 --> 59:33.760
because I got to see Flava Flav.

59:33.760 --> 59:36.360
Okay, so you watched, like, season three, or two or three.

59:36.360 --> 59:36.960
I don't remember what it was.

59:36.960 --> 59:37.960
I watched episodes.

59:37.960 --> 59:38.560
Okay.

59:38.560 --> 59:39.760
I can count them on one hand.

59:39.760 --> 59:41.760
Well, the new season's gonna be good,

59:41.760 --> 59:44.160
because they're gonna have Amorosa, who now...

59:44.160 --> 59:45.360
Oh, I know you're happy.

59:45.360 --> 59:46.560
Wasn't she your hero?

59:46.560 --> 59:49.200
I loved that woman. She was on The Apprentice.

59:49.200 --> 59:52.280
And I didn't love her because like I actually

59:52.280 --> 59:55.360
thought she was cool, but I loved to hate her.

59:55.360 --> 59:59.040
No, I don't think... Anyway.

59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.960
Also what I love is

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:05.600
Balke from Perfect Strangers is supposed to be on surreal life five and that is

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:06.640
just so cool to me.

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:10.720
Because what the heck has Balke done since Perfect Strangers?

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:14.400
B movie. He's in a B movie, I have it. I'm gonna

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.080
I'll be bringing it home soon, actually.

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:20.160
He needs to do Old Navy commercials now, just like the other washed-up actors.

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:25.520
Well, either you, you know, either you, uh, do Old Navy commercials or you, you know,

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:26.800
join this real-life cast.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.240
What happened to the other guy that was on Perfect Strangers?

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:32.000
They said bring back Perfect Strangers.

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:35.600
That's not a bad, that's not a bad idea.

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:37.120
I mean, they're not doing anything.

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:38.800
I mean, no one knows them for anything.

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:39.520
Bring it back.

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:41.200
I mean, it can't be worse than Joey.

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:46.200
All right. Julie, get your butt over here and say hi.

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:51.200
Oh, we have a special guest that just came in studio. Get your butt over. Has Julie ever been on the show before?

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:56.200
She's as webcam shy as I am. No, Julie hasn't been on the show before.

01:00:56.200 --> 01:01:01.200
Well, hi, Julie. Say hello. Hi, audience.

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:06.200
This is Julie, also known on the web, the big internet monster as

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:13.080
19 who never updates her live journal except once every six months. They can't

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:17.800
hear what you say if you don't talk into the microphone as you know.

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:23.800
It's been about nine months. I'm horrible. Here's Rob. PSO addict. Oh PSO is a good

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:26.960
game though. Actually somebody in chat room was just asking me about that. The

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:31.080
people in chat were like the people in the people in chat were asking me about

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:36.120
PSO you know saying you know does anybody actually play PSO anymore?

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:40.120
And I'm like, well, actually, yeah, if you go on Xbox, you can get shit-talked by so many people.

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:42.120
I play some TSOs sometimes.

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:43.120
Once in a while.

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:45.120
Julie still needs to give me my Oppa Oppa.

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:50.120
Alright, uh, let's see, moving on.

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:56.120
That was enough pop culture news. Let's talk about some actual Bomani news going on out there in the scene.

01:01:56.120 --> 01:02:04.120
Actually, surprisingly not a whole heck of a lot, with the exception of some follow-up to the earlier announcement about 2DX Happy Sky.

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:08.900
you know you hear this 2d x12 style is gonna be called happy sky happy happy

01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:16.420
happy brain twitch I know I know some very interesting things they are they

01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:21.940
are just changing things upside down now all this you know is kind of coming off

01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:27.280
test location data so it could be subject to change high speed is going to

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:30.700
be in there now but it's going to be in halves as well like so you can play you

01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:33.580
know one speed two speed you could kind of do that before but now you can have

01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:41.100
half 1.5 2.5 I think that's kind of cool they're supposed to be also on hidden

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:48.620
plus and sudden plus available in there s random mode as well the sudden plus

01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:53.780
and hidden plus they're also they have adjustable hidden sudden areas so where

01:02:53.780 --> 01:03:00.180
you can pretty much decide where the notes appear or they disappear etc now

01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:04.900
Now here's the other very interesting thing, instead of light, normal, another, now it's

01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:08.260
going to be normal, hyper, another.

01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:12.340
And this being probably, I think, some of the biggest news, the ratings are all changing

01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:15.220
because now anothers are going to be ranked.

01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:19.400
So now instead of being like one through eight with flashing eights, which is the way it

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:24.180
is now, for a lot of folks that are on home versions, you might only have seen one through

01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:28.420
seven with flashing sevens, but in the arcades now it's one through eight with flashing eights.

01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:36.020
Now it's going to be 1 through 12, and one of the reported level 12 songs, V-Another,

01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:38.420
which you know, if you've ever seen V-Another, not a problem.

01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:41.900
Yeah, and I would think that Sakura would be up there.

01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:43.100
Oh, I don't know.

01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:47.580
They're saying right now that that is the only level 12 one.

01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:54.040
I think that as far as the DJ Lisu videos, that was the only one he had to do with using

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:57.040
two hands.

01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:59.920
Some scary stuff.

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:04.320
And then some pictures are available if you visit our website, www.orangelandrado.com.

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:07.900
And of course, some of the news, and I think we might have touched on this a little bit

01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:13.480
last week, I don't remember, but there is a crossover artist showing up from DDR Ultra

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:15.480
Mix 2.

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:18.200
Big idea, who did the song Toe Jam?

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:24.640
Toe Jam is going to be in Happy Sky, which is really weird that a USA artist is crossing

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:25.640
over into 2DX.

01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:32.880
it's kind of neat though. Well, there's good talent all over the world. There is, but when

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:39.240
I think of all the possible DDR songs in history that were created for DDR that should cross

01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:44.400
over into Beatmania 2DX, ToeJam isn't really the first one that comes to my mind. It's

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:51.920
not a bad start, just, you know, it could be better. Well, they've gotten European artists.

01:04:51.920 --> 01:05:00.160
I guess that's true. Some other artists coming back as well. Twin Amadeus,

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:04.640
Platonic X, a lot of folks you know. Ryu of course going to be back. Ryu kind of

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:08.200
just started all of a sudden showing up all the time. Terra, all those folks. So

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:13.240
check that out. That will be location testing currently and hopefully coming

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:20.760
to an arcade near you pretty soon. So I guess that's pretty much the biggest

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:24.660
is going on right now. I can think of some local Bomani news going on. I want to touch

01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:29.080
on this and then we'll open up the spotlight. In Sacramento, two things, jack and shit.

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:33.000
Well actually no, there's a pretty big story going on right now. But it's at an arcade

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:38.840
we don't really go to a whole lot, Roseville Golf Land. Now, understandably we are an international

01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:42.400
radio program, so we have folks that listen all over, but sometimes we talk about our

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:46.800
neck of the woods, which is Sacramento. And we have this arcade here, it's a beautiful

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:51.900
It's a two story, huge arcade with a fancy water park.

01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:52.900
It's ghetto.

01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:53.900
It's ghetto as hell.

01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:58.500
Because parents drop their children off there and just leave them there to wreak havoc on

01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:00.900
the whole place and so they break machines and everything.

01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:07.740
Well here's the great news, Roseville Golfland got Guitar Freaks and Drummania V, the brand

01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:09.540
new ones.

01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:10.820
I have a reason to go again.

01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:12.300
Already the hi-hat is broken.

01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:18.380
Okay, why does that crap not surprise me whatsoever?

01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:22.020
And the green button on the left guitar is broken as well.

01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:25.640
At least some woman didn't try to change her baby's diaper on it like on the little keyboard

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:26.640
mania.

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:27.640
Although...

01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:29.380
Probably would have if there was a platform to do so.

01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:33.260
Yeah, I caught somebody doing that one.

01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:34.740
So you know, that's great.

01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:38.820
We're all excited because we're getting the new Guitar Freaks Drummania V and it's very

01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:41.380
interesting because I was talking to one of our listeners before the show who lives in

01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:45.660
Vegas and they're all excited because they just got 2DX red and guitar freaks

01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:50.100
and drum mania V and I'm like yeah we got it too except you know 2DX red

01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:53.700
doesn't work it's just a frame without a monitor right now and guitar freaks

01:06:53.700 --> 01:07:00.420
drum mania V both broken haha you know what they should let me run

01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:07.380
gothland first of all there would be absolutely none of those retards that

01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:11.820
piss me off allowed. Would there actually be a sign on the door that says no retards

01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:16.820
that piss me off? Exactly. And I'll have a list of the people that I've actually had

01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:23.160
kicked out so that they would know specifically that they are not allowed in. And then I would

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:28.500
have to have some type of scanning device I think. Maybe, maybe we would be like the,

01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:34.340
you remember the Studio 54? Yes, I do remember, yes. We would be the Studio 54 of the 21st

01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:38.820
I like that idea. Except with no cocaine bar in the back room.

01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:42.420
How about a heroin bar? Can we have that instead?

01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:45.940
Okay, we can have heroin, but we'll have to move to the Netherlands.

01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:51.220
Okay, so I just want to kind of catch you up on that, that, you know, we're all

01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:53.900
excited to have Guitar Freaks and Drummania V in town,

01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:58.260
and I would give you my full review, however, shit's broken,

01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:03.580
so I can't, so sorry guys. Maybe we'll go take some pictures of the broken stuff, we'll see.

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:07.500
Anyway, we are going to open up the Skype line if you guys want to call in and interact

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:08.500
with our program.

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:13.460
You have something you want to comment on, such as possibly the new 2DX Happy Sky, something

01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:15.140
that's going on in your neck of the woods.

01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:19.300
I know there were a couple DDR tournaments that went on pretty recently.

01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:20.300
We'll open up the Skype line.

01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:22.260
In fact, we're already getting a call, so let's go to it.

01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:24.180
Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:29.500
Emerging from the shadows of Bimani style, here's your resident 2DX bastard, Darkline

01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:30.500
XVI.

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:31.500
Hey, Sky, sit here.

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:33.060
Wow, you've got quite a...

01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:37.740
I should get a fanfare to play when he introduces a doo-doo-doo-doo!

01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:39.660
Alright, what's on your mind, buddy?

01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:41.140
Well, yeah, you...

01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:43.120
and yeah, I already told you that uh...

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:48.180
Vegas has officially gone VN Red. We have GITADORA VN and 2DX Red

01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:51.740
as of last Thursday. Yeah, so you were the person I was mentioning a little bit earlier.

01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:54.100
Tell me about going on... what's going on in Vegas.

01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:57.180
Now, did you hear what I was just saying about Roseville Golf Lands got all that

01:08:57.180 --> 01:08:59.340
too, except none of it works? Yeah, okay.

01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:01.100
Yeah, we're lucky here.

01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:09.600
Oh, and about 2DX12, Happy Sky, I have to mention to you the songs that are 12 stars on single.

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:13.300
Oh, is there more than just V another? I only had heard of V another. What else is there?

01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:26.600
Uh, there's Ace, Double Ace, Colors Radio Edit, Time, Genocide, Gigadelic, Innocent Walls, Moon Child, One More Lovely, Please Don't Go,

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:35.000
And Piano Kyousou Kyoku Daichi-ban Sasori, AKA PF Conchato Achiares, Sakura, and...

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.900
Ah, so Sakura is? It's 12.

01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:40.800
I told you. Didn't I tell you?

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:42.700
And Setsugetaka.

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:48.900
So there are quite a few Anothers. Okay, that's good. Good difficulty there for the folks that can actually do that stuff.

01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:50.100
More power to you.

01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:54.400
I'm lucky if I can pass an 8, especially considering I haven't played in quite some time.

01:09:54.400 --> 01:10:06.400
But I'm really excited about the Anothers actually having rankings now, because, you know, I follow 2DX, but I'm not, like, super obsessed, like, I don't study note charts, like, I have friends that do this, and that's cool.

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:08.400
I don't, you know, that's cool if that's what they're into.

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:21.400
But, like, if I'm gonna play an Another, I wanna instantly be able to know which Another is in my range, because you know how, like, Holic was, like, a 6, but the Another for Holic is frickin' insane?

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:27.000
Like you know, so I want to know about where the another stand whereas like dual control another from what I remember

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.120
It was not that much harder than the original. So

01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:31.760
It's just you know, I want to know where they stand on the scale

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:34.480
So that's going to be very helpful to somebody like me. So I'm excited about that

01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:40.440
Yeah, and then the singles for 11 stars are it's already listed here on this website

01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:47.020
Mm-hmm. I got to mention it there this one there are the Reds are gonna be in another so first samurai

01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:54.880
Andromeda, Blox, Checking You Out, Click Again, Daddy Daddy, Faith Time Hyper, G2,

01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:28.380
And those are all the 11's? Yeah, the 11's are ours. Interesting, wow. Stoick, Stoick

01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:33.060
another is not a 12, it's an 11? Well, I guess I could see that though. Compared to like

01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:38.980
Moon Child another, I guess I could see that. Alright. So what else is going on besides

01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:46.260
that 2DX update. I just sent you a private message about the videos for the location

01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:52.260
test on 2DX 12 Happy Sky. I'm going to post it on the chat room. Yeah, post us a link

01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:56.020
there in the chat room at orangehomesradio.com, click on chat. And for those who are listening,

01:11:56.020 --> 01:12:02.180
it's at xenon.sub.jp. Okay, cool. So post that link in our chat room and then folks

01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:06.700
can check out the Happy Sky test location videos. Can you actually hear any of the music

01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:11.980
at all in some of this? It's very clear! Oh good! The first video that I checked out is

01:12:11.980 --> 01:12:18.980
100% Minimoog by Sota Fujimori. Oh okay, cool. How's the song sound? It's really fast. It's

01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:25.900
at 252 BPM. Well I'll have to check that out a little later. If it's clear enough, maybe

01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:31.380
we'll play some on the show a little later. It's really clear. Very cool. Alright. Anything

01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:35.460
else you want to share with us tonight, Ziggy? Well, last thing I want to say is quit calling

01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:42.420
by its styles you always keep on calling 11 styles i know but it's just i i i don't know how to

01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:48.260
explain it it's just uh it's like a style thing it's just yeah it's like you know i'm the 10th

01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:52.820
style and then it just seems logical the next 2dx because they haven't changed the hardware or

01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:57.460
anything they've only changed they really haven't changed much than what they changed going from

01:12:57.460 --> 01:13:03.700
fifth to sixth and sixth to seventh and so on so yeah i just naturally called 11 i know it's red

01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:08.900
and happy sky but seriously do you expect me to call this new 2dx happy sky and keep a straight face

01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:14.900
i know yeah everybody can't tell you're gonna call it 12 style yeah and speaking of 12 star

01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:23.860
there is such a song called 12 style huh there's a in in happy sky there's gonna be a song called 12

01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:32.180
style yeah that's pretty cool so maybe it's okay then that i call it 12 style yeah all right all

01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:35.180
Alright, well thank you for the pronunciation update, I appreciate it.

01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:39.180
Not so much pronunciation, but you know, like referring to.

01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:42.180
I gotta mention the videos on the Sinon subs that they have.

01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:48.180
The first one is Captivate Joka, which means purify.

01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:52.180
Second video they have is Gekko, which is moonlight.

01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:54.180
And then the third one is Green Eyes.

01:13:54.180 --> 01:14:01.180
And then the last one is the video that I mentioned is 100% Minimoog.

01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:04.020
I'm gonna have to check that out because I want to hear some of those songs. I want to hear what they sound like

01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:10.140
So I'll definitely be looking at that. Yeah. All right. All right. Well, thanks for the call bud. You have a good one later

01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:12.140
All right later

01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:16.860
Resident 2dx bastard Siggy we always like hearing from him. Let's go to another call

01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:19.620
Hello, you are on orange launch radio

01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:23.660
Greetings is Ron Masato me one more time. How you guys doing? Good. How are you doing?

01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:27.760
Somewhat tired. I want you to know that I am a devoted fan of the show

01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:33.760
I went to Boston this weekend, and I arranged my trip so I could come back in time to catch the show.

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:38.760
That's hardcore. Yes, it is. That's very hardcore. You didn't have to do that for us.

01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:43.760
I mean, heck, if I was going to Boston, I wouldn't have rearranged my trip to come back for this show.

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:48.760
But we adore you for it. You are awesome and fabulous. Yes, you are awesome and fabulous.

01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:53.760
Well, I do try. Alright, right on. What else is on your mind? What's been going on in your game and world this week?

01:14:53.760 --> 01:15:01.760
Oh, not much. I've been playing some of my old PS2 games recently. Right now I'm trying to work through Musashi. I'm in love with it.

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:05.760
Oh, the brand new one on PlayStation?

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:07.760
Yeah, the new one on PS2.

01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:08.760
Right on.

01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:16.760
I've been playing through Anamusha 2. I'm off for the next three days. I have stacks of anime box sets I have to plow through.

01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:21.760
And I just picked up the season box set to 21 Jump Street.

01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:25.760
Hahaha, that's awesome. I try.

01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:29.760
I'm surprised you're not a big 21 Jump Street fan, DarkSakura. 21 Jump Street?

01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:33.760
I watched it a bit when it came on TV, but I wasn't

01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:37.760
so not into Johnny Depp at the time. It was all River Phoenix.

01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:41.760
Okay, alright. But maybe now you'd have more respect for it? I don't know.

01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:45.760
Not really. Okay, sorry.

01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:49.760
Oh, by the way, guess what, Ranma. Yeah, what's up?

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:55.760

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:24.840
well i don't want to talk to you

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:28.320
but let me add to that

01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:31.840
you have to cost a little child where he's a she got to you know i've been

01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:36.420

i can't wait by can one

01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:45.160

01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:48.940
there's one on fans view back in the day and then there was one of me as mad

01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:51.260
hatter for angel sanctuary

01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:55.020
okay i'm gonna have to go dig it through that and ask kevin if he can send it to me

01:16:55.020 --> 01:16:57.020
i'll see if i have it somewhere

01:16:57.020 --> 01:17:02.020
it's horrible, it was like sixty pounds heavier in it

01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:04.280
but you're probably still a cop anyway

01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:07.280
that is so sweet

01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:09.380
oh fluster, eager fluster

01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:12.940
yeah she's already living on another planet tonight we don't need to yell

01:17:12.940 --> 01:17:14.940
Hey, I am a celebrity!

01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:16.940
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:18.940
You just watch it.

01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:21.940
Just for that, I'll eat a bag of M&M's just for you.

01:17:21.940 --> 01:17:23.940
Aww.

01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:27.940
Alright, any other ass you want to kiss while you're on the line here, Ronma?

01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:32.940
I love you, Sky, because you're still a devoted fan of the DS.

01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:35.940
I am. I have faith in the DS. Right now, it's very-

01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:37.940
Well, I appreciate that. Thank you, Rob.

01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:41.940
Not that DS.

01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:44.500
Every time somebody says DS, Dark Soccer goes, hee hee, that's me.

01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:45.980
Well, why wouldn't they think about me?

01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:46.980
I know.

01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:50.140
But no, it's hard for me to be a fan of the DS right now, because we're in a little bit

01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:53.320
of the slump, but I am still a fan of the DS.

01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:58.940
You know, and I think it's okay for me to say I am a fan of both the DS and the PSP.

01:17:58.940 --> 01:17:59.940
There's nothing wrong with that.

01:17:59.940 --> 01:18:00.940
I like them both.

01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:01.940
I agree.

01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:06.220
I'm going to buy a PSP once Sony fixes all the kinks, and I'll wait for a second or third

01:18:06.220 --> 01:18:07.220
generation unit.

01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:11.060
I'm just not a fan of the price of the PSP, but I'll get over it.

01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:14.380
I'll get over it eventually.

01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:18.660
Two hundred and fifty bucks please. We couldn't even buy them when they came out.

01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:22.420
If it came with Luminous packed in, that would so be worth it.

01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:24.100
We'll see.

01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:26.400
Alright, well I'm going to let you go. Have a good one, buddy.

01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:28.780
You too. Enjoy the rest of the week. Thank you. Have a good...

01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:31.820
Thanks for calling. Have a good week. Bye.

01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:35.660
Let's see if we can get in one more call at least. Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:39.860
Hey, SSJ100 Matt here. Hello, SSJ100 Matt. What's on your mind?

01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:45.120
nothing um... i guess i was going to be true punches can talk about the

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:46.560
dear friends uh...

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:49.520
car yeah that's right you would want to send that to me yes i was going to i was

01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:52.260
gonna make a mention of this after the statement but that's okay

01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:56.120
all right well what what what side going on with the dear friends with the snooze

01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:57.960
you found out about your friends

01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:02.220
or just uh... fan about this earlier uh... this weekend um...

01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:06.060
it turns out that the dear friends uh... fall fancy constant coming to the east

01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:07.480
coast

01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:12.080
So, and like we're not talking Chicago, which to some of us in California, Chicago counts

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:15.200
as East Coast, but not really to the rest of America.

01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:20.360
So now it's actually going to be in an East Coast state, so some of you guys are going

01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:21.360
to be able to catch this.

01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:26.080
So, you have some of the details you want to tell our listeners?

01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:28.960
They're going to kind of not be like in the major cities, they're going to kind of be

01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:32.300
in like corners of the East Coast.

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:36.520
First one is going to be on May 20th in Hartford, Connecticut.

01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:39.880
on. I have friends who live in Connecticut. They'll be happy about that information.

01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:46.000
Yeah, and in June 24th and the 25th Atlanta, Georgia is going to have it.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:53.760
Okay, so some southeast fun there, okay. And then for some reason they put in San

01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:59.840
Diego for East Coast touring, but you know. San Diego, North Carolina! No, it's

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:05.040
San Diego, California is getting another show, so there you go. So for those of you

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:09.640
that maybe missed out on the previous L.A. show. Here's your chance. You can go to San Diego.

01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:12.240
That's going to be July 14th and then

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:16.800
July 23rd and the 24th, they're going to have it in Detroit, so...

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:19.880
Very cool. Try not to get shot at that concert, by the way.

01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:23.040
Well, I won't go to that one. I'll go to the Hartford one. Okay, very cool.

01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:25.400
I have friends in Connecticut who would be interested in going.

01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:28.680
If I had time off work, I would go, but I won't.

01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:29.560
And the money.

01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:31.920
And money, yeah. Absolutely.

01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:35.200
I'm looking forward, though, to the More Friends concert that's going to be happening in L.A.

01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:38.400
I do have tickets, so I'm very excited about that, so we'll see what happens.

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:42.240
But... yep, um...

01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:45.440
Ad here, I'm waiting for In The Groove to finally come.

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:50.000
I mean, it's been sitting in a DDR 4th Mix case for about two months.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:54.160
And this is not working, or...? No, they just had...

01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:58.160
they have, like, the logo for In The Groove and everything on it,

01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:01.520
and they still just have 4th Mix playing on it.

01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:04.720
somebody's too lazy to get in there and switch it over

01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:08.120
I mean it's Goughland, you guys have a good time

01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:11.360
okay, okay, wait I didn't know Goughland existed on the east coast

01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:15.600
No, it's Arizona, no, I'm from the east coast but I'm going to school in Arizona

01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:18.600
gotcha, okay I'm sorry, okay gotcha, huh

01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:23.360
that's kinda, okay, so they've got in the groove just sitting there waiting to go

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:24.320
okay well

01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:27.800
in the groove you know it's, for me there's good things about it

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:30.480
there's bad things about it, I've said this just about every week

01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:37.480
I find it very interesting what's going on on The Freak right now, over on DDR Freak, about their April Fools post.

01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:45.480
Just, they've turned into these huge In The Groove vs DDR messes, and I'm just kinda like, can't we all just get along?

01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:51.480
You know, there's things to like and things to not like about both games. Everybody can improve a little bit.

01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:58.480
I just, I really don't like that attitude, though, when folks, you know, I guess this is the one thing I will say kind of against In The Groove,

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:03.080
but it's not really the game itself so much as the fan base, but I really hate it when

01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:10.040
people come on and go, ah, DDR's dead, time to move on. Well, okay, didn't they just release

01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:14.820
a press release in January that said DDR sold a million copies? Yeah, DDR is like really

01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:20.440
dead. Maybe DDR is dead in the arcades, but that's only because, you know, Konami's stupid,

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:25.360
for lack of a better term. But as far as the home releases go, DDR is far from dead. And

01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:31.040
And I firmly believe that DDR will continue to own In the Groove on the home releases.

01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:35.340
But In the Groove is going to pick up the arcade stuff if DDR doesn't do anything.

01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:39.400
So it's going to be interesting.

01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:43.280
I'm just anxious to try it, that's it, because everyone's talking about it.

01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:47.160
I'm just wondering if the hype's what it is.

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:52.320
You have to let us know what you think once you get a chance to try it out.

01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:56.320
Yep, I'm watching the Yankee game and listening to you guys, so...

01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:58.320
All right, sounds good.

01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:02.320
All right, well enjoy the game, and I guess we'll talk to you another time, all right?

01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:03.320
Yep, take it easy.

01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:05.320
All right, have a good one. Bye-bye.

01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:08.320
Watching the game, having a bud.

01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:09.320
Sitting back.

01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:10.320
Wasabi!

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:12.320
Smoking a bud. No, I'm kidding.

01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:15.320
All right.

01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:17.320
Wasabi!

01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:22.320
Pretty much the sushi restaurant version of What's Up last night.

01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:24.320
Oh, really?

01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:25.600
Yeah.

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:28.280
Was that on the internet for download?

01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:33.580
We were, when I was at Iguana Girls last night, we were going through some of her old discs

01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:37.800
and it was one of the things on there too along with Tokyo Breakfast.

01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:44.840
Tokyo Breakfast is like a one punchline joke, but it's still kind of amusing.

01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:52.000
the edited picture of Quasimodo now that was posted on iguana girls journal

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:59.400
earlier which made me laugh because that was an old joke yeah but funny nobody

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:03.680
knows what the hell we're talking about so forget it let's just move on to we're

01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:06.080

We are facing the fire together

01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:43.680
If we don't move, I'll be apart

01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:46.680
Save your tears for the day

01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:50.680
When nothing is far behind

01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:53.680
On your knees, how do you feel?

01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:56.680
Fear of sound and light

01:25:56.680 --> 01:26:03.680
Set your fears, take your place, save them for the judgment's sake

01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:11.680
Let them dream, follow me, and to make the sacrifice

01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:16.680
Will you rise or fall?

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:33.040
Okay, that was a clip of song number one, that was Yoko Kanno with Rise.

01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:38.920
Alright, we're gonna go into my song for tonight's cage match, and what we're gonna do tonight

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:44.020
is um I've decided that I'm going to declare war on the listeners because I'm

01:27:44.020 --> 01:27:48.980
a little pissed off at how poorly received Kelly Clarkson was last week so

01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:58.980
I've decided screw you guys I'm putting in Britney Spears song number two for me

01:27:58.980 --> 01:28:05.580
to you with love Britney Spears with every time the Valentine remix

01:28:28.980 --> 01:28:38.980
But for me, strength is when I'll scroll

01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:42.980
Why can't we all fall asleep?

01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:48.980
Learning from the fact that I fall without my wings

01:28:48.980 --> 01:28:53.980
I feel so small, cause I need you baby

01:28:53.980 --> 01:28:55.980
You're a human, I see

01:28:55.980 --> 01:28:57.980
You've ruined my dreams

01:28:57.980 --> 01:29:01.980
I see your face is haunting me

01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:04.980
I guess I need you baby

01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:06.980
Baby

01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:08.980
Baby

01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:21.980
Baby

01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:29.980
I make believe that you are here

01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:36.980
Ain't no mistake, I be clear

01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:39.980
What have I done?

01:29:39.980 --> 01:29:44.980
You seem to know what we need

01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:46.980
Every time you try

01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:49.980
Just like I fall without my wings

01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:54.980
I've been so small I guess I need you, baby

01:29:54.980 --> 01:29:58.980
And every time I see You've been my dream

01:29:58.980 --> 01:30:02.980

01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:05.980
I guess I need you, baby

01:30:09.980 --> 01:30:16.980
I may have made a break Please look at me

01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:20.980
My weakness calls your face

01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:27.980
And my soul falls so free

01:30:27.980 --> 01:30:29.980
And every thunderstorm

01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:33.980
Just like I fall without my wings

01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:35.980
I feel so small

01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:42.980
I guess I need you, baby, baby

01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:44.980
And let it don't miss me

01:30:44.980 --> 01:30:50.620
You and my dream, I see your face, you're haunting me

01:30:50.620 --> 01:30:53.740
I guess I need you, baby

01:30:53.740 --> 01:30:59.480
And every time I try, I fall without my wings

01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:01.680
I feel so small

01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:04.680
I guess I need you, baby

01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:12.400
And every time I see, you and my dream, I see your face, you're haunting me

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:15.400
And I can't help me do it again

01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:21.400
I may have made a break, break, break

01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:40.400
Minus 57

01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:47.640
Because it's Britney Spears. I don't know. The music was okay. It was just like, hi, I'm cookie cutter pop, and

01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:50.680
it made me feel nauseous.

01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:58.160
So much that not even a coconut cream pie would bring back my appetite. I'm sorry, Rob. That was...

01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:01.780
That's all right. I'm not going to take it personally tonight. Just awful. All right.

01:32:01.780 --> 01:32:08.060
beyond awful all right Julie right this thing negative 57 from Dark Sakura let

01:32:08.060 --> 01:32:11.500
me go to Loki then we'll get to Julie Loki you know that didn't even really

01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:15.620
sound like Britney Spears to me I I don't I don't know it just didn't sound

01:32:15.620 --> 01:32:21.920
like it to me but I hate her because she ruined my prerogative so amen you know

01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:27.460
she gets a minus one I'm not gonna go as far as 57 cuz that's just ridiculous all

01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:31.660
right Julie I go with minus 58 I just had to be the word given her the lowest

01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:45.620
score of all all right fair enough angel no no you ruined my something or others

01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:57.620
God negative infinity Oh Loki's gonna change his vote my vote is going to be

01:32:57.620 --> 01:33:06.740
158 plus infinity so it's an even zero so that song shut up all right um me

01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:10.380
personally I will be the only one to give it a positive score obviously I'm

01:33:10.380 --> 01:33:15.100
the one to put that in there I give that song a seven because you know it's not

01:33:15.100 --> 01:33:20.980
that bad. It's a dance remix and like Loki said, it barely sounds like Britney at all.

01:33:20.980 --> 01:33:26.820
And you know what, you guys earned it. Taints of evil, Rob, taints of evil. You earned it.

01:33:26.820 --> 01:33:31.540
And you know what, it was worth it alone for the chat room's reaction, honestly. I should

01:33:31.540 --> 01:33:39.540
do that more often, thank you for the encouragement. Alright, let's get into song number 3. Loki.

01:33:39.540 --> 01:34:09.520
Okay, um, now this song, I made it for a couple reasons. One, uh, well, first off, the song I made, okay, um, this is, basically, I found this Max remix on Bamani Style by this guy named DJ Pato, he's like some Spanish guy, and he really sucks at making remixes, and he made this song called Max Extension, which is retarded, but it has this really cool, um, song in the background in it, and I was like, you know, hey, that'd be a pretty cool song to make a Max remix out of, so that's what I did.

01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:23.540
So, um, adding to my next installment of, you know, the Legend of Trance series, um, this is also, this was supposed to be because my original thought for the, uh, April Fool's joke was going to be Max 300 radio and this was going to debut at the end.

01:34:23.540 --> 01:34:36.540
Well, that didn't happen, so, um, and it's, well, this would, this song would be called Legend of Techno, but that's just retarded, and since I already have, you know, Legend of Trance and Legend of Trance 2004, this is Legend of Trance 2005,

01:34:36.540 --> 01:34:43.540
with the new synonym, Maximum GX, and you know, the song is remixed from F-Zero GX, so, enjoy!

01:34:44.540 --> 01:34:46.540
Here it is, Loki's putting in...

01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:50.540
And I know you guys hate Max remixes, but, lives.

01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:56.940
All right, here it is. Loki is putting in his own creation. It's a Max remix. It's

01:34:56.940 --> 01:35:03.940
Maximum GX with Legend of Trance 2005. Here it is, song number three.

01:37:26.940 --> 01:37:45.220
Song number three, Legend of Trance 2005.

01:37:45.220 --> 01:37:48.860
Let's see what they thought of it, Dark Sakura.

01:37:48.860 --> 01:37:51.700
My head hurts.

01:37:51.700 --> 01:37:52.700
Okay.

01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:57.380
Okay, um, it was, I'm sorry, it was Max.

01:37:57.380 --> 01:37:59.340
It made my head hurt.

01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:01.580
I twitched.

01:38:01.580 --> 01:38:05.380
But it's not Britney Spears, so it gets a seven.

01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:07.900
Alright, Loki.

01:38:07.900 --> 01:38:09.140
It's okay.

01:38:09.140 --> 01:38:10.980
I, I tried.

01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:14.860
I really don't care, just, just gonna play the song later anyways, so...

01:38:14.860 --> 01:38:18.820
It gets a nine, because I made it.

01:38:18.820 --> 01:38:24.020
julie got a mic, can julie give it a rank there?

01:38:24.020 --> 01:38:26.780
here comes julie

01:38:26.780 --> 01:38:29.340
i give that song

01:38:29.340 --> 01:38:31.980
a two, i really wasn't paying much attention though, i'm sorry

01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:34.060
alright, that's alright

01:38:34.060 --> 01:38:37.180
uh... i give it

01:38:37.180 --> 01:38:41.140
i don't know i'm torn because it's a good remix there's a lot of stuff

01:38:41.140 --> 01:38:42.760
going on with it but

01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:47.380
i fucking can't take max anymore i really really cannot take max anymore

01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:53.520
I'm done I'm sorry Loki I'm so done with that song so like I would normally give

01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:57.220
it like a nine but I'm taking three points off because it's a max remix so

01:38:57.220 --> 01:39:04.180
it gets six angel by the way I'd like to give the whole initial D soundtrack a

01:39:04.180 --> 01:39:12.740
big fat zero because you're a beat sucks ass now now don't get angry just because

01:39:12.740 --> 01:39:19.740
you to enter to max remix angel good beats and stuff in there um but it's max and i'm

01:39:20.980 --> 01:39:27.980
not i don't know i just i can't deal with regular max or whatever so uh i'll be nice

01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:35.700
and give it a seven you know if you wanted to make a good mix you could do like legend

01:39:35.700 --> 01:39:41.700
of butt or something i love i love the fact that three of us said it's a good remix but

01:39:41.700 --> 01:39:49.020
it's max you know you people you suck I mean honestly yeah it's been overdone

01:39:49.020 --> 01:39:52.580
but that's because it's a hard song and people like remixing it oh actually

01:39:52.580 --> 01:39:56.660
people like putting other things on top of it and calling it a remix or speeding

01:39:56.660 --> 01:40:01.020
it up or reversing it or god knows what else I just the only reason I made this

01:40:01.020 --> 01:40:04.780
song is because that song by DJ pedo sucked and I thought I could make it

01:40:04.780 --> 01:40:09.340
better and I did whether it be trust me you want you want to hear the original

01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:15.580
the original sucked ass okay let me just go that far i have no doubt you made a better

01:40:15.580 --> 01:40:22.700
remix than this other guy but i want max i want you know what you know what we should do i i want

01:40:22.700 --> 01:40:28.540
to get dj paranoia on the show and i think we could arrange it and i want him to say on air

01:40:28.540 --> 01:40:33.260
that they will ban max remixes from the stepmania catalog i don't know what we have to do to him to

01:40:33.260 --> 01:40:37.500
get him to do that but i think we need that to happen can we do you think that's possible

01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:43.800
that if the name max is in the title of the song it's banned we have to put a

01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:47.980
but have to curse them want to do something I'm gonna talk I'm gonna see

01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:51.100
if I can get a hold of them because I I don't know what we have to bribe him

01:40:51.100 --> 01:40:56.060
with but I want it done I want my dream put to a stop ice cream is that a winner

01:40:56.060 --> 01:41:00.620
I can send him lots of ice cream lots of ice cream and even my song will still be

01:41:00.620 --> 01:41:02.620
And girl scout cookies.

01:41:02.620 --> 01:41:04.620
There's no max in the title at all.

01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:06.620
We'll send, uh, girl scout cookies.

01:41:06.620 --> 01:41:08.620
To Boaz. That always happens.

01:41:08.620 --> 01:41:10.620
I'm seriously going to get in touch with him.

01:41:10.620 --> 01:41:12.620
We'll see.

01:41:12.620 --> 01:41:14.620
We'll send him girl scouts to serve us then.

01:42:31.820 --> 01:42:37.460
op team. Your ops will help you out. All right, let's get to this. This is usually a part

01:42:37.460 --> 01:42:40.700
of the show where I ask Loki what the hell's going on in the sim scene besides unnecessary

01:42:40.700 --> 01:42:44.860
Max remixes, but I know there's quite a bit going on this week. There's some very colorful

01:42:44.860 --> 01:42:47.940
things going on, so what's up?

01:42:47.940 --> 01:42:52.780
Well, first off, I'd like to mention there's a common thing under DJ Pato's new remix,

01:42:52.780 --> 01:42:59.020
which is Max Life Superior Cancer Mix. I don't know what the fuck that is, but I love his

01:42:59.020 --> 01:43:04.860
comment. This is the best, like, comment right here. It says, Alex Calderia and Badass, they

01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:11.160
must meet to eat shit. I don't know what that means, but the whole quote, they must meet

01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:19.400
to eat shit, is funny. I don't know. But anyways, I digress. No, but April Fool's Day. You're

01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:23.700
only a fool if you didn't download these packs, because there are so many being released,

01:43:23.700 --> 01:43:29.820
it's not even funny. We have the release of D3 Mix 2, which is just another DDR, like,

01:43:29.820 --> 01:43:40.260
you know food mix type thing. One nice little 186 meg file there. We had LFT mix which was

01:43:40.260 --> 01:43:46.680
also released that day. Strawberry Steps which was also released that day. All of these are

01:43:46.680 --> 01:43:51.980
just like Food Mix. Strawberry Steps actually has the videos just like Food Mix. All really

01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:56.560
good stuff to download, to at least play while you're waiting for Food Mix 2 to come out.

01:43:56.560 --> 01:44:01.780
So check this out, if you're looking for links, there's a whole thread on Bomani style under

01:44:01.780 --> 01:44:09.920
the DDR simulation form there, and that's Japanese DDR fan mix in parentheses like food

01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:14.420
mix watch, and check page 3 and there's your download links right there.

01:44:14.420 --> 01:44:21.880
And supposedly coming out on the 15th is DDRXX mix, and so look for those to be coming out,

01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:26.780
of good stuff they're constantly updating this thread with you know

01:44:26.780 --> 01:44:31.300
everything that's coming out apparently the Japanese scenes look a lot better

01:44:31.300 --> 01:44:38.140
than ours like most everything else that's gone oh and DDR UK I mentioned

01:44:38.140 --> 01:44:41.820
they were coming up April 1st there was an April Fool's joke sort of they're

01:44:41.820 --> 01:44:48.420
coming up they're actually launching Monday so look for DDR UK the coming

01:44:48.420 --> 01:44:52.740
back when they're April Fool's joke something about who Konami supports us

01:44:52.740 --> 01:44:56.340
now like any of us would believe that no they're actually April Fool's joke was

01:44:56.340 --> 01:45:01.500
they're gonna be dancing all right dancing stage fusion UK or something

01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:06.740
like that it was for a little bit it was really stupid but um so that was up

01:45:06.740 --> 01:45:10.460
there um but my self as far as I'm aware they didn't do an April Fool's thing

01:45:10.460 --> 01:45:15.780
probably because last year is kind of retarded but um I don't know so yeah

01:45:15.780 --> 01:45:19.780
Yeah, DDRUK is coming up tomorrow, supposedly.

01:45:19.780 --> 01:45:26.780
Well, at least their joke wasn't something, like, really stupid, like, getting bought by, like, another media corporation or something, because that would just be stupid.

01:45:26.780 --> 01:45:29.780
So, at least it was Konami, so...

01:45:29.780 --> 01:45:34.780
Yeah. Yeah, that would suck.

01:45:34.780 --> 01:45:40.780
So, yeah, nothing really going on in the sim scene other than, you know, more max remixes that suck.

01:45:40.780 --> 01:45:44.780
But, you know, I've got to put a new one out every now and then just because, you know, I...

01:45:44.780 --> 01:45:50.780
I don't know. I've been trying to make some other stuff, but, you know, this song...

01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:56.780
Usually when I make stuff, it's usually to make something that's better than someone else's stuff, so...

01:45:56.780 --> 01:46:01.780
Blame it on them. If they wouldn't put the stupid sim files out, I wouldn't get inspiration to make another max remix.

01:46:01.780 --> 01:46:03.780
It's all their fault.

01:46:03.780 --> 01:46:08.680
I swear I'm gonna write him an email as soon as this show's over and and say we

01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:12.720
want to interview you we want to talk to you about a very serious issue facing

01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:16.520
the Bahmani community and then and then spring it that we're we want to ban max

01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:21.800
remixes and we need his help because that site only perpetuates it encourages

01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:26.880
people to make max remixes about paranoia remixes you know what I haven't

01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:30.360
had my limit of that yet although I'm getting very close I you know in a

01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:36.240
perfect world we would ban max remixes paranoia remixes and there's another one

01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:45.040
huh drop no not drop out there's another one that needs to be stopped maybe

01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:49.400
Sakura well Sakura is kind of another version of max 300 though so but but it's

01:46:49.400 --> 01:46:55.000
Sakura is awesome the original yeah but not remixes I haven't really heard too

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:59.380
many remixes but nothing could you know I can't really consider Sakura a version

01:46:59.380 --> 01:47:05.420
Max 300 just because it's so awesome on its own but only because it shares an

01:47:05.420 --> 01:47:11.740
entire baseline for max 300 but it has the other that makes it instantly cool

01:47:11.740 --> 01:47:15.540
now whatever they're gonna make banjo 300 or something like that and they'll

01:47:15.540 --> 01:47:20.620
just have a banjo over the that would be awesome banjo 300 I thought of it a bag

01:47:20.620 --> 01:47:24.500
now you don't get a whole lot of bag remixes but people that try to remix it

01:47:24.500 --> 01:47:29.020
try to be funny and usually it's like bag survivor anything was survivor

01:47:29.020 --> 01:47:34.720
in the title that's it anything was survivor unless it's the destiny's child

01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:37.420
song and even then I think somebody already did it so we don't need anymore

01:47:37.420 --> 01:47:41.920
so that's it unless maybe you're gonna do like I have a tiger I don't know if

01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:46.320
anybody's done that that might be okay but I want like all like your cowgirl

01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:51.160
survivor the seven jump survivor let them move survivor I want that shit

01:47:51.160 --> 01:48:03.100
stopped. Let me just point out, and to further Rob's argument about bad Max remixes, let

01:48:03.100 --> 01:48:09.820
me just read to you the latest Max remixes that are being released right now. We have

01:48:09.820 --> 01:48:17.040
Max Borg Assimilation, Max Life Superior Cancer Mix, The Legend of Max OTLK Version, Max Unlimited,

01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:23.040
Sakura Max Unlimited 300, Max Fantasia Version 3, meaning there has been two more before that,

01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:30.040
Max 300 The Wacko Reflex Remix, Paranora Survivor Max, Max Energy High Voltage Remix,

01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:36.040
Unlimited Legends of Max Version 2, Max Extension, 2 Max 330, and that...

01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:40.040
Now, I'm gonna cut you off right there, because that is just in the past week.

01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:42.040
That's just in the past week!

01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:47.040
Fuckin' stop, people! Seriously!

01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:52.040
And then like you go into the week before, Love Love Shine Survivor Max.

01:48:52.040 --> 01:48:56.040
Yeah, just what we needed. Ass.

01:48:56.040 --> 01:49:00.040
We'll get to the cage match winner in a little bit, but first we're gonna go to a quickie break.

01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:05.040
And in this break, Max remixes! No, just kidding.

01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:10.040
We're gonna do, uh, I don't know. I wanna do a song that really doesn't suck.

01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:14.040
What's a song like that just doesn't suck?

01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:16.040
From what?

01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:18.040
How about the original song? We can do the original.

01:49:18.040 --> 01:49:20.040
Yeah, play Sakura.

01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:23.040
Even though it's kind of Max, but you're right.

01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:25.040
It's got the extra something something that makes it a little better.

01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:26.040
How about Xenon?

01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:28.040
We'll do Xenon. I like that.

01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:30.040
Okay, I'm liking these ideas.

01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:33.040
So, we will be back after this.

01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:37.040
I'm having trouble locating the Sakura file.

01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:39.040
I know I have it somewhere.

01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:44.440
doo-doo-doo-doo. Don't forget you can visit our website. We have the webcam over at www.orangeloungeradio.com.

01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:49.540
Of course, there's not a whole lot interesting on webcam tonight, because we don't have quite a full studio, as we sometimes do.

01:49:49.540 --> 01:49:53.740
But you'll catch one of us dancing in front of it once in a while, so it's definitely worth checking out.

01:49:53.740 --> 01:49:56.340
Also, the chat room, of course.

01:49:56.340 --> 01:50:02.840
Alright, we'll be back after this, with more Orange Lounge Radio, and we got the FUs of the Week coming up at some point.

01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:07.040
And we might have to do some kind of game tonight. We'll have to do some type of game or something as well.

01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:09.040
So we'll be back after this

01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:44.040
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:38.040
Uh-huh

01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:39.040
Uh-huh

01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:55.040
Uh-huh, uh-huh Uh-huh, uh-huh

01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:43.040
The

01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:47.040
The

01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:51.040
The

01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:55.040
The

01:55:55.040 --> 01:55:59.040
The

01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:03.040
The

01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:07.040
The

01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:46.820
For them practice!

01:56:46.820 --> 01:56:51.400
Save it!

01:56:51.400 --> 01:56:56.440
Save it!

01:56:56.440 --> 01:57:21.160
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio and that break you heard a little bit of Sakura

01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:25.960
followed by Xenon, R3 and Innocent Walls both by request from the chat.

01:57:25.960 --> 01:57:29.960
Actually, the chat just said, play something Taku, so I picked one for you and played for a while.

01:57:29.960 --> 01:57:31.960
Taku makes me all flush.

01:57:31.960 --> 01:57:33.960
Or as you said in the chat room, Taku is sex.

01:57:33.960 --> 01:57:34.960
Yes.

01:57:34.960 --> 01:57:36.960
Which is funny because then someone said, you know what, Jaime?

01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:39.960
You always come in here and you just say something is sex, and then you leave.

01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:42.960
I am not obsessed.

01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:48.960
No, you're not necessarily saying Taku is sex, but you go in there and you'll be like, gorillas are sex.

01:57:48.960 --> 01:57:51.960
Or, you know, like, Orange House Radio is sex.

01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:54.960
Or, you know, Splenda is sex.

01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:59.160
So Splenda is sweet. Splenda is sweet. But you know, you go in there,

01:57:59.160 --> 01:58:03.760
oh my God, that's sex. You know, it's like me and that's hot. Like, you know.

01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:05.640
That hot. That's hot.

01:58:05.640 --> 01:58:08.720
We need to tell them the story of that hot. Julie.

01:58:08.720 --> 01:58:10.360
That hot. Can we get Julie and Mike?

01:58:10.360 --> 01:58:12.280
Does Mike work? Oh yes, it does.

01:58:12.280 --> 01:58:17.400
Okay. The story of that hot. There was a gentleman on Fantasy Star Online, well, I'm saying that

01:58:17.400 --> 01:58:22.600
nicely about him, who would always, he kept trying to say that's hot. He's not originally

01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:26.040
an English speaker, and it was very obvious that he would refer to everything as that

01:58:26.040 --> 01:58:32.280
hot. And the phrase just kept carrying on and carrying on. He's a very unique individual.

01:58:32.280 --> 01:58:36.920
His name is Guan Li, and he lives somewhere in Minnesota. I don't know exactly where,

01:58:36.920 --> 01:58:41.720
but I know he's in Minnesota. Minnesota? Alrighty, back to the video on the show. Okay, that

01:58:41.720 --> 01:58:48.320
hot, that hot. That's awesome. I might have to start saying that, that hot, ouch, that,

01:58:48.320 --> 01:58:52.360
somebody in the chair of that out that hot

01:58:52.360 --> 01:58:54.120
that's great

01:58:54.120 --> 01:58:55.720
okay let's find out who

01:58:55.720 --> 01:58:58.900
uh... one tonight's cage match

01:58:58.900 --> 01:59:02.520
ready to find out when the cage match wasn't going to anyone

01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:03.920
i'm fabulous

01:59:03.920 --> 01:59:05.580
and it is only here it is

01:59:05.580 --> 01:59:09.240
the winner of tonight's cage match

01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:13.240
three weeks

01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:18.300
yoko kano with the rise you know that means was girls next week yoko kano

01:59:18.300 --> 01:59:24.160
is going for retirement. That'll only be, if it gets retired next week, it'll be the

01:59:24.160 --> 01:59:27.300
third track in Orange Lounge history to get retired

01:59:27.300 --> 01:59:31.560
behind Echo Image with Comeback and Gwen Stefani with Whatchu Waitin' For.

01:59:31.560 --> 01:59:36.640
This is Yoko Kano is awesome. How Gwen Stefani made it four weeks with a bunch of top

01:59:36.640 --> 01:59:39.280
40 haters I will never understand, but it really did.

01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:42.720
People had no taste and voted for the sellout.

01:59:42.720 --> 01:59:46.120
Alright, so there it is, Yoko Kano with Rise.

01:59:46.120 --> 01:59:51.120
Next week is the retirement week, so Loki, you and I are gonna have to bring out the big guns.

01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:54.120
Oh man, I have to bring girls back.

01:59:54.120 --> 01:59:56.120
Oh wait, that's not the big guns.

01:59:56.120 --> 01:59:57.120
Dear God, no.

01:59:57.120 --> 01:59:59.120
Great, so it's all gonna come down to me, apparently.

01:59:59.120 --> 02:00:03.120
So, I will have to find the perfect song.

02:00:03.120 --> 02:00:08.120
I know something that they'll vote for every time, so I'll bring it next week.

02:00:08.120 --> 02:00:12.120
I'm like, what echo image do I have that we haven't put in yet? Let's see.

02:00:12.120 --> 02:00:16.820
No, it comes down to one name, Ayumi Hamasaki.

02:00:16.820 --> 02:00:22.020
Oh, Ayumi, that's what we should do. Let's just make this, you know, we're gonna have to make them choose between like,

02:00:22.020 --> 02:00:25.820
Yogo, Ayumi, and then I'll do Utada. And then we'll just like...

02:00:25.820 --> 02:00:28.120
As long as it's not Easy Breezy.

02:00:28.120 --> 02:00:30.320
Aw, but I like Easy Breezy.

02:00:30.320 --> 02:00:31.720
And also Japaneasy.

02:00:31.720 --> 02:00:37.220
I actually see the Easy Breezy video at the gay club once in a while, because I don't know, like,

02:00:37.220 --> 02:00:41.420
Utada apparently has a gay following or something, who knew? Who knew?

02:00:41.420 --> 02:00:44.780
but they actually show the easy breezy video there and like whenever it comes

02:00:44.780 --> 02:00:48.300
on i'm the only person that kind of starts like smiling and kind of dancing

02:00:48.300 --> 02:00:53.500
like you know and then all my friends are like oh god it's this song oh god

02:00:53.500 --> 02:00:59.100
rob god you know what what i need to um

02:00:59.100 --> 02:01:05.820
to send you one of her and uh shoot who was it it's it's some rapper

02:01:05.820 --> 02:01:09.900
chick it was off of the uh rush hour 2 soundtrack

02:01:09.900 --> 02:01:12.080
blow my whistle

02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:12.880
uh...

02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:16.660
blow my whistle? I don't know who it was. Missy Elliott or something?

02:01:16.660 --> 02:01:20.480
No, I don't think so, but it was one of her first English ones.

02:01:20.480 --> 02:01:22.680
Oh, okay. Oh, it's a Japanese.

02:01:22.680 --> 02:01:23.780
I'm sorry.

02:01:23.780 --> 02:01:26.880
I thought you just said it. It's a tarehikaru.

02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:27.960
Oh, I didn't know it was her.

02:01:27.960 --> 02:01:32.500
Yeah, I'll find it. It's one of her early all-English ones.

02:01:32.500 --> 02:01:36.060
Oh, I'll have to find it.

02:01:36.060 --> 02:01:37.520
uh...

02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:38.800
Moving on.

02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:46.500
I thought we could get into the DDR Freak post of the week, because of course, you know,

02:01:46.500 --> 02:01:49.920
we have a lot of respect for our buddies over at DDR Freak, because of course, you know,

02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:53.960
well Jamie happens to be on the staff over there, and the fact that, not just that, but

02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:59.340
we also have the replays that happen on DDR Freak Radio every Friday night.

02:01:59.340 --> 02:02:03.380
So if you actually should miss an episode of Orange Lounge Radio, shame on you, but

02:02:03.380 --> 02:02:07.520
you know, if you have a trip to Boston or something, just so you know, you don't have

02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:10.080
to screw up your vacation just so you can come home and listen to Orange on the Radio.

02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:15.200
You can catch it. We appreciate your loyalty. Yeah, you can catch it the week after on DDR

02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:20.080
Freak. When I say the week after, I mean this Friday's show will actually be last Sunday's

02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:23.640
show. It's kind of like a week gap, and that's just, I don't know why it is that way, but

02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:27.320
it just is. I think that's to give us a little bit of a buffer should we miss a week or something.

02:02:27.320 --> 02:02:32.500
It's to save our butt a little bit, so we'll see. Anyway, let's get into the DDR Freak

02:02:32.500 --> 02:02:41.140
post of the week. Uh, I have a tie for the DDR Freak post of the week this week because

02:02:41.140 --> 02:02:46.580
there's two really, really good ones. So we're going to start off with this one. It's a thread

02:02:46.580 --> 02:02:52.620
and it was created in DDR Chit Chat, which is the home of great DDR Freak posts of the

02:02:52.620 --> 02:03:00.620
week. We love our spam. This post was by a basic member and the subject is New Religion

02:03:00.620 --> 02:03:09.480
anti-DDR forever and the post reads join my friends new religion anti-DDR

02:03:09.480 --> 02:03:16.480
forever it's Christian based but it says that DDR is a sin he has added an extra

02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:21.760
commandment no DDR by the way commandment was spelled without a D so he

02:03:21.760 --> 02:03:25.700
added it was posted by an illiterate five-year-old he added an extra

02:03:25.700 --> 02:03:34.040
commandment no DDR that's the post it's Christian based but they've added an

02:03:34.040 --> 02:03:43.560
extra commandment they should meet Rob that that earns a yay he's a demo Beth

02:03:43.560 --> 02:03:48.440
he's a demo now no but this is the funny thing this is what makes the post more

02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:53.960
hilarious than anything is the signature says here this is the guy's signature

02:03:53.960 --> 02:04:05.360
I'm single and it sucks who didn't think that like seriously I would like to know

02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:09.160
was there anybody in the chat room when I said I'm single and it sucks is this

02:04:09.160 --> 02:04:12.480
guy's signature is there anybody in the chair anybody out there listening that

02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:17.840
didn't think I wonder why I have to know

02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:26.680
The third post down, oh yes. Somebody above it said WTF you're either a

02:04:26.680 --> 02:04:30.040
complete idiot or just a terrible troll I'm guessing the latter and then the

02:04:30.040 --> 02:04:34.920
next person said I'm guessing both and then this is great somebody else jumps

02:04:34.920 --> 02:04:38.800
in there says ah and using the Lord's name in vain like you did in one of your

02:04:38.800 --> 02:04:46.080
other posts is not a sin. Oh snap. Okay. Somebody totally served that guy. I need this thread

02:04:46.080 --> 02:04:51.320
though cuz I have to look at something on it actually it was locked I'd oh

02:04:51.320 --> 02:04:57.720
okay I I will link deal me like link the whole chat room to that or just you

02:04:57.720 --> 02:05:01.280
yeah link the chair into that go have fun with that you guys although the

02:05:01.280 --> 02:05:06.600
post is locked you can't follow up on that anymore so all right um let's see

02:05:06.600 --> 02:05:11.720
one other post because one DDR free post of the week is just not enough there

02:05:11.720 --> 02:05:17.040
were too many good posts this week so we have another one here and it's actually

02:05:17.040 --> 02:05:23.320
not a brand new topic but it was posted in an existing thread and it's in the

02:05:23.320 --> 02:05:31.600
red octane ignition version 2.0 thread and this is post number 182 and this is

02:05:31.600 --> 02:05:35.640
what's great is that you get to see what happens when DDR freak filters take over

02:05:35.640 --> 02:05:42.060
here's the post looks like after Frick two weeks of use this pad is already

02:05:42.060 --> 02:05:46.620
starting to give out here come the Frick random goods on seven footers Frick

Frick poopy. I love the filters. I really do love the filters on DDR Freak.

02:06:21.300 --> 02:06:27.540
That makes the whole post right there. Don't frick, buy this red octane, can frick, suck

02:06:27.540 --> 02:06:31.740
my penis, then vomit and eat that too.

02:06:31.740 --> 02:06:36.300
It's like a really bad version of like DDR Mad Libs or something.

02:06:36.300 --> 02:06:41.740
Oh man, go to the filters, that's funny.

02:06:41.740 --> 02:06:44.740
Frick you all, frick you all!

02:06:44.740 --> 02:06:51.540
Man, DDR freak people post a bunch of freaking, freaking garbage.

02:06:51.540 --> 02:06:52.540
What's that?

02:06:52.540 --> 02:06:55.300
I don't stand for censorship in the chat room.

02:06:55.300 --> 02:06:56.300
Oh.

02:06:56.300 --> 02:06:57.300
Alright.

02:06:57.300 --> 02:07:03.220
If you have a suggestion for DDR Freak post of the week, you can always send me a private

02:07:03.220 --> 02:07:07.760
message on DDR Freak. My name is Skye, S-K-I-E. And actually some folks have done that. We

02:07:07.760 --> 02:07:11.980
actually had, I think last week, or two weeks ago, was a user submitted post of the week.

02:07:11.980 --> 02:07:17.780
So send those over. But please remember, if you see mental retardation going on on DDR

02:07:17.780 --> 02:07:21.580
Freak, and it's not somebody who is actually mentally retarded, because that would be okay.

02:07:21.580 --> 02:07:25.740
That's okay if somebody actually is mentally retarded. But if somebody is acting mentally

02:07:25.740 --> 02:07:30.840
retarded you need to PM a moderator so they can lock the thread yes look you

02:07:30.840 --> 02:07:36.240
know one hi send me a private message I can I'll make sure you're taken care of

02:07:36.240 --> 02:07:41.740

02:07:41.740 --> 02:07:48.680
vomit to one uh I'll find it guys I'll post it in chat oh I found it there it

02:07:48.680 --> 02:07:54.420
is remember guys it's post 182 in the thread it's a very large thread so have

02:07:54.420 --> 02:08:01.580
fun with that all right you know there is a way you can get around those

02:08:01.580 --> 02:08:04.580
filters if you're smart yeah but we're not gonna tell you yeah I'm not gonna

02:08:04.580 --> 02:08:08.860
tell you but it's not that hard to figure out just you know you just have

02:08:08.860 --> 02:08:12.300
to be bold about doing it that's all

02:08:12.220 --> 02:08:22.140
what what what all right anyway what it wasn't funny when I read it it's all

02:08:22.140 --> 02:08:24.780
No, but it made me laugh again the second time.

02:08:24.780 --> 02:08:28.220
Because of all the caps and stuff, like it goes from caps to lower the caps.

02:08:28.220 --> 02:08:29.660
It's just funny.

02:08:29.660 --> 02:08:36.540
And I quote, poopy buttocks frick.

02:08:36.540 --> 02:08:41.740
All right.

02:08:41.740 --> 02:08:45.220
Let's see, what else are we going to get into here in NewsWise?

02:08:45.220 --> 02:08:49.820
I thought there was some other news that needed some talking about here this week.

02:08:49.820 --> 02:08:57.460
something going on you know we've got our podcast that goes on and you can

02:08:57.460 --> 02:09:01.620
download that from our website www.orangelinerator.com and click on to go

02:09:01.620 --> 02:09:05.320
and that's where you can figure out what's going on with the rest of the

02:09:05.320 --> 02:09:08.820
gaming world we've kind of started to expand to talk a little bit more about

02:09:08.820 --> 02:09:14.460
the general gaming world here on this program but you know we talk a lot about

02:09:14.460 --> 02:09:18.320
other stuff on the other program you know somebody was asking in the chat

02:09:18.320 --> 02:09:24.520
room earlier what happened with DDR featuring Mario and that was a good

02:09:24.520 --> 02:09:28.080
question because we haven't heard a whole lot about DER featuring Mario

02:09:28.080 --> 02:09:31.960
lately so I kind of decided hey as long as I'm on DER Freak making fun of people

02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:38.480
maybe I'll go and actually get a useful thread and I went to check out what's

02:09:38.480 --> 02:09:42.880
going on on the DDR GameCube thread and there's really not a whole lot going on

02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:48.940
right now apparently there might be screenshots in GMR magazine but there's

02:09:48.940 --> 02:09:55.560
nothing really super official that has been announced yet so and then rumor is

02:09:55.560 --> 02:10:02.240
that screenshots for the pad have come out recently but nothing super duper

02:10:02.240 --> 02:10:07.300
official that we haven't already seen as of yet so there's that answers the DDR

02:10:07.300 --> 02:10:12.540
featuring Mario question as well um I guess what we're gonna do now is we're

02:10:12.540 --> 02:10:15.640
gonna go ahead and get a little bit angsty so if you guys want to go ahead

02:10:15.640 --> 02:10:21.240
and submit some F use of the week to my private inbox there in the chat room

02:10:21.240 --> 02:10:26.000
just send me a private message we will start to get angsty with a little

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:29.240
segment we call the F use of the week and Jamie why is it that we have to do

02:10:29.240 --> 02:10:33.040
the FUs of the week every single freaking week.

02:10:33.040 --> 02:10:40.040
Because the world sucks! This world is bullshit!

02:10:50.940 --> 02:10:55.660
A FU to my busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, did I say busy?

02:10:55.660 --> 02:10:58.960
Schedule. Okay.

02:10:58.960 --> 02:11:03.400
work all the damn time. I go to the gym, I go to school,

02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:07.300
and then by the time I get home I'm too damn tired to do anything else

02:11:07.300 --> 02:11:10.240
except work on, you know,

02:11:10.240 --> 02:11:13.120
whatever projects I happen to have going on.

02:11:13.120 --> 02:11:17.320
A big F.U. to, uh,

02:11:17.320 --> 02:11:20.640
putting a lot of hard work into something and then

02:11:20.640 --> 02:11:22.920
not having it recognized.

02:11:22.920 --> 02:11:29.400
And that's happened several times over the past week, so I've been kind of eh.

02:11:29.400 --> 02:11:35.040
F you to my driver's side window for randomly becoming detached from the mechanism that

02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:39.160
holds it up and rolling itself down, creating a loud whistling noise not unlike that heard

02:11:39.160 --> 02:11:40.160
in a hurricane.

02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:43.520
It's really aggravating when I'm trying to listen to my good music really, really loud

02:11:43.520 --> 02:11:47.800
in my little, you know, 93 treble.

02:11:47.800 --> 02:11:51.360
My speakers are bad enough as it is.

02:11:51.360 --> 02:11:56.080
F.U. to the person who was going 10 miles under the speed limit when I'm trying to go 20 over.

02:11:56.080 --> 02:12:00.760
I hope that no CHP people are listening to that.

02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:05.840
And a big F.U. to myself for not being able to decide on what my next hair color should be.

02:12:05.840 --> 02:12:12.000
Maybe I should leave that to the chat room. Find me a haircut and find me a hair color because I'm getting

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:17.320
damn tired of what I have now. And a big F.U. toward

02:12:17.320 --> 02:12:20.840
having people not recognize how

02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:22.840
Much of a fabulous celebrity I am.

02:12:22.840 --> 02:12:23.840
I'm done.

02:12:23.840 --> 02:12:26.720
said

02:12:26.720 --> 02:12:30.520
low-key it's all you

02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:34.600
okay first off fuck you to god damn

02:12:34.600 --> 02:12:39.720
me hitting a car that fucking sucked and you know that just totally

02:12:39.720 --> 02:12:43.520
put a big huge roadblock in my perfect weekend

02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:47.280
so fuck you that um also

02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:53.120
um fuck the fact that uh Mitch Hedberg had to die because he was touring with

02:12:53.120 --> 02:12:55.620
steven clinton out of an awesome to see

02:12:55.620 --> 02:12:58.620
now i think that the people in

02:12:58.620 --> 02:13:00.180
uh...

02:13:00.180 --> 02:13:02.120
and uh...

02:13:02.120 --> 02:13:06.160
but he did the pope for not dying fast enough for me to make a joke about it on

02:13:06.160 --> 02:13:07.520
april fool's day

02:13:07.520 --> 02:13:11.780
god damn it you know he's clean-to-life you just need to die

02:13:11.780 --> 02:13:15.200
die quickly and he was going there and read about the right to tell it

02:13:15.200 --> 02:13:18.440
okay yet we're just waiting for them separated okay

02:13:18.440 --> 02:13:22.380
and i mean they weren't even try and he was just like you know dying

02:13:22.380 --> 02:13:29.220
the hell with him and um also um i know i had some other ones oh once again fuck you

02:13:29.220 --> 02:13:34.420
to me for hitting that car um only because the car was an SUV being driven by women and

02:13:34.420 --> 02:13:40.820
you know how i say women drivers women who drive SUVs fucking suck there's a big you

02:13:40.820 --> 02:13:47.980
know bit of irony for me so um oh well i i live it last accident been it was like seven

02:13:47.980 --> 02:13:51.860
years ago anyways so and this is like not even doesn't even really even

02:13:51.860 --> 02:13:59.420
qualify as an accident since I did no damage to my car so whatever um and I

02:13:59.420 --> 02:14:02.780
think that's finally it fuck you to me for having this goddamn headache and it

02:14:02.780 --> 02:14:07.460
really sucks so yeah for some reason I feel really hot right now too I think I

02:14:07.460 --> 02:14:11.460
to turn the air on. That's it. That's all for now.

02:14:19.460 --> 02:14:23.460
F you to the fact that there's been so much death in the media lately,

02:14:23.460 --> 02:14:27.460
like between that chick in Florida and the Pope. I'm sick of hearing about people dying.

02:14:27.460 --> 02:14:31.460
Let's hear about something happy once in a while. I want to hear about Disneyland

02:14:31.460 --> 02:14:35.460
getting a new ride or something. So just, God, find

02:14:35.460 --> 02:14:42.420
find something happy to report on once in a while you guys dang um an f you to

02:14:42.420 --> 02:14:47.940
um damn there's something else goes around in my tongue I asked you to

02:14:47.940 --> 02:14:52.840
PSPs for costing so much money an f you to work drama I had on Friday nothing

02:14:52.840 --> 02:14:57.300
terrible but just I was an angsty little man on Friday and I didn't participate

02:14:57.300 --> 02:15:01.740
in April Fool's Day really as much as I wanted to because of things that were

02:15:01.740 --> 02:15:05.440
going on on Friday and it just I hate it when things put me the bad mood like

02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:14.700
that bar so and then F you to the fact that I think my car needs repairs because

02:15:14.700 --> 02:15:17.700
I don't like having to pay for that stuff that's all right it's not your

02:15:17.700 --> 02:15:21.600
fault unless you were the one that broke my car then it is your fault no I didn't

02:15:21.600 --> 02:15:28.160
all right and then I also F you lastly F you to the house of wax for having

02:15:28.160 --> 02:15:30.160
Paris Hilton in it. That's not hot.

02:15:30.160 --> 02:15:32.160
Hey, what if she dies?

02:15:32.160 --> 02:15:36.320
You know what? That's what I was saying. Since she doesn't have top billing, she's likely

02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:40.160
to be an extra character that gets offed in the movie. So that would be worth seeing.

02:15:40.160 --> 02:15:45.160
I noticed in the trailer the first thing that they show her is making a sex tape.

02:15:45.160 --> 02:15:50.160
Oh, but I'm sure that's supposed to be funny. Nope. Sorry.

02:15:50.160 --> 02:15:56.660
Comedy. Let's go to the rest of the room here and get their FUs. Starting off with DDR Angel

02:15:56.660 --> 02:15:57.660
and then over to Julie.

02:16:26.660 --> 02:16:28.660
But, nobody else did, so that's kind of sad.

02:16:29.660 --> 02:16:31.660
And, let's see.

02:16:32.660 --> 02:16:33.660
I think that's it.

02:16:33.660 --> 02:16:34.660
Oh yeah.

02:16:34.660 --> 02:16:38.660
And uh, F you to, uh, Ultra Mix 2's load time.

02:16:38.660 --> 02:16:39.660
Cause that's sad.

02:16:41.660 --> 02:16:42.660
Alright, Julie!

02:16:43.660 --> 02:16:48.660
F you to the stupid person who on the way here tried to cut me off and made me go all the way around.

02:16:48.660 --> 02:16:51.660
Um, F you to my schedule, I agree with that.

02:16:51.660 --> 02:16:55.860
with that and f you I agree with all the people dying though the Pope got on the

02:16:55.860 --> 02:17:00.940
anniversary of my cat's death which is kind of interesting and by the way at

02:17:00.940 --> 02:17:04.020
Disneyland there is something happy going on on May 5th they're doing their

02:17:04.020 --> 02:17:07.140
big anniversary celebration that needs to be in the news I'm sick of all the

02:17:07.140 --> 02:17:11.240
death too there we go see I want to hear about happy children partying at

02:17:11.240 --> 02:17:15.940
Disneyland and then getting blown away with bombs no I'm saying I'm kidding I'm

02:17:15.940 --> 02:17:24.220
not that sadistic. Alrighty, and I guess that's the end of my F.U. for today. Alright. I do

02:17:24.220 --> 02:17:27.660
like what the chat room is saying though, they're suggesting that there be a Kingdom

02:17:27.660 --> 02:17:37.460
Hearts ride added at Disneyland. That would be hot. That hot. That hot. That hot. Great,

02:17:37.460 --> 02:17:42.700
you can tell Gwan that he's infected Orange Lounge Radio now. I will let Gwan know. We're

02:17:42.700 --> 02:17:45.480
We're gonna get a shirt with all our new catchphrases that we have invented.

02:17:45.480 --> 02:17:46.480
Demub-ass?

02:17:46.480 --> 02:17:47.480
That-hot?

02:17:47.480 --> 02:17:48.480
What else do we have?

02:17:48.480 --> 02:17:49.480
Death cake?

02:17:49.480 --> 02:17:50.480
Death cake?

02:17:50.480 --> 02:17:51.480
We'll see.

02:17:51.480 --> 02:17:54.680
You will have tea and cake with the vicar or you will die!

02:17:54.680 --> 02:18:01.480
The new one, um, they need to meet and eat poop, or eat shit.

02:18:01.480 --> 02:18:05.160
The one that was from DJ Pito's thing.

02:18:05.160 --> 02:18:08.040
I still go with poopy buttocks frick.

02:18:08.040 --> 02:18:13.560
Frick poopy eat my penis and vomit too or whatever the hell that said.

02:18:13.560 --> 02:18:14.560
You know what our shirt should be?

02:18:14.560 --> 02:18:16.640
It should just be a bunch of DDR freak posts.

02:18:16.640 --> 02:18:21.760
No, we just need this shirt that says OLR that hot.

02:18:21.760 --> 02:18:25.600
OLR that hot.

02:18:25.600 --> 02:18:27.200
That would be just fabulous.

02:18:27.200 --> 02:18:28.200
I like that idea.

02:18:28.200 --> 02:18:29.200
We'll have to see.

02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:30.200
Okay.

02:18:30.200 --> 02:18:35.000
Anyway, let's get to the chatroom FUs, shall we?

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:41.080
Thank you, Captain Jack, who's going to be walking us through the chatroom FUs.

02:18:41.080 --> 02:18:44.640
I don't think you can pronounce this all one word, and if I...

02:18:44.640 --> 02:18:45.640
Is this...

02:18:45.640 --> 02:18:46.640
I don't know.

02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:47.640
Lxldoobs.

02:18:47.640 --> 02:18:48.640
We'll say that, Lxldoobs.

02:18:48.640 --> 02:18:49.640
Lxldoobs?

02:18:49.640 --> 02:18:50.640
I don't know.

02:18:50.640 --> 02:18:58.520
Lxldoobs says, I need to send an FU to Resident Evil 4 for making me kill Spanish-speaking

02:18:58.520 --> 02:18:59.520
monsters.

02:18:59.520 --> 02:19:00.520
What's next?

02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:02.520
Lawn mowing aliens?

02:19:02.520 --> 02:19:08.560
illusion says f you to myself for falling asleep before robot chicken last

02:19:08.560 --> 02:19:12.720
week and torrent box for not having the file up for me to download fuck the cunt

02:19:12.720 --> 02:19:22.200
of Russia oh and here's me oh and here's me plugging www.cynictaxi.co.nr

02:19:22.200 --> 02:19:27.160
cynical articles and general wackiness the search for robot chicken torrents

02:19:27.160 --> 02:19:29.080
It's not on torrentbox, but I found it.

02:19:29.080 --> 02:19:29.880
So it's out there.

02:19:33.160 --> 02:19:36.760
DJ Tyrant says, F you to having to play 11

02:19:36.760 --> 02:19:38.720
in the first round of RGC.

02:19:38.720 --> 02:19:39.680
F you to school.

02:19:39.680 --> 02:19:43.000
F you to the in-the-groove screen at Electric Avenue.

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.360
John Field says, F you to running out of space

02:19:45.360 --> 02:19:46.760
again in my computer.

02:19:46.760 --> 02:19:47.600
I can't believe it.

02:19:47.600 --> 02:19:50.840
I'm at 773.17 gigabytes, and I've

02:19:50.840 --> 02:19:53.880
used almost all of it up again.

02:19:53.880 --> 02:19:54.380
Yes.

02:19:54.380 --> 02:19:55.200
I win.

02:19:55.200 --> 02:19:57.200
I just bought that 400 gig,

02:19:57.200 --> 02:20:00.100
I just bought that 400 gig hard drive in January.

02:20:00.100 --> 02:20:02.640
I really need cheap terabyte drives.

02:20:02.640 --> 02:20:04.860
Also, F you to this stupid raid card

02:20:04.860 --> 02:20:08.080
that crashes my computer randomly and unrecoverably.

02:20:08.080 --> 02:20:11.180
F you to turning my room into the pigsty that it is now.

02:20:11.180 --> 02:20:12.980
F you to not enough hours in the week.

02:20:12.980 --> 02:20:14.980
Oh, and F you to daylight savings time.

02:20:14.980 --> 02:20:16.620
Why does this exist?

02:20:16.620 --> 02:20:19.780
Thank you, oh my God, I completely forgot.

02:20:19.780 --> 02:20:23.200
A giant F you to daylight savings time.

02:20:23.200 --> 02:20:24.380
Because of daylight savings time,

02:20:24.380 --> 02:20:30.260
I didn't get to bed until 6 in the morning today. That's bad. I mean, 5 in the morning

02:20:30.260 --> 02:20:34.820
is pretty bad. 6 in the morning, really bad. So, you know, just F you to Daylight Savings

02:20:34.820 --> 02:20:38.700
Time. I hate you. Please die. Why do we have Daylight Savings Time? Somebody told me it's

02:20:38.700 --> 02:20:43.140
a farmer's thing. That they did it so that farmers could get up at a reasonable hour

02:20:43.140 --> 02:20:49.500
and tend to the crops. You know what? Julie? Yeah, it was due because there was some votes

02:20:49.500 --> 02:20:53.460
and actually there's some areas of the United States that don't actually observe it. It's

02:20:53.460 --> 02:20:58.820
because they were mad parents were having their kids walk to school while it was dark.

02:20:58.820 --> 02:21:01.100
The farm thing I'm not doubting is true as well.

02:21:01.100 --> 02:21:02.100
Get the kid a flashlight.

02:21:02.100 --> 02:21:03.100
I agree.

02:21:03.100 --> 02:21:04.100
Get the kid a gun.

02:21:04.100 --> 02:21:05.100
I totally agree with that.

02:21:05.100 --> 02:21:09.580
I dig daylight savings time though because then I get to drive to work in the dark again.

02:21:09.580 --> 02:21:10.580
It weirds me out.

02:21:10.580 --> 02:21:13.060
Because I get to drive to work at 6am in the morning.

02:21:13.060 --> 02:21:16.100
Unless our kids walk to school anyways.

02:21:16.100 --> 02:21:32.100
Honestly, I mean, buses pick up any kids that are, like, one mile, you know, further away. I mean, who gives a shit? Most people don't walk anyways, and the people that do walk, oh no. Yeah, because you know all those muggers out there that want to steal their kids' lunch money.

02:21:32.100 --> 02:21:43.100
Woo! Seriously, in this part of town where I'm from, like, you know, all the 16-year-olds have SUVs anyway, and they're all driving to school, so, whatever. Anyway, sorry. Let's get back to the FUs.

02:21:43.100 --> 02:21:51.180
Rama says, fuck you to the city of Boston for not having beer.

02:21:51.180 --> 02:21:52.180
Argh!

02:21:52.180 --> 02:21:56.820
We had to travel out in the suburbs for it, and the liquor stores closed at 9.

02:21:56.820 --> 02:21:59.040
Fuck this nonsensical period in bullshit.

02:21:59.040 --> 02:22:00.040
Fuck Boston.

02:22:00.040 --> 02:22:01.280
Oh yeah, fuck Red Sox.

02:22:01.280 --> 02:22:02.280
Go Yanks.

02:22:02.280 --> 02:22:04.180
Oh God, he's going to start that on this show.

02:22:04.180 --> 02:22:08.260
SSJ100Matt says, F you to DVD Studio Pro.

02:22:08.260 --> 02:22:12.940
The programs keep crashing in my class, thus taking forever to finish my final project.

02:22:12.940 --> 02:22:19.700
FU to me for taking forever to get out of the 7 and 8 step range in DDR, 3 to 5 months

02:22:19.700 --> 02:22:21.940
and counting.

02:22:21.940 --> 02:22:27.860
FU to the Farley brothers and Jimmy Fallon for making the Boston Red Sox movie.

02:22:27.860 --> 02:22:33.420
Nintz says FU to the place I ordered my PS2 flip top from, it's 2 weeks late and I can't

02:23:46.180 --> 02:23:48.860
little bit of a break. We're gonna come back from this break and open up the

02:23:48.860 --> 02:23:54.340
lines for some Ask Orange Lounge. Oh yes, one of your favorite segments. And if we

02:23:54.340 --> 02:23:57.280
don't start getting some questions for Ask Orange Lounge, we will start, you know,

02:23:57.280 --> 02:24:00.400
showing you some other stuff that's going on. Yeah, we'll have Paris Hilton

02:24:00.400 --> 02:24:03.400
No, we have some other stuff from around the internet. We won't talk to you guys about it, so.

02:24:03.400 --> 02:24:04.400
We'll make Loki sing.

02:24:04.400 --> 02:24:07.400
No, we'll have something fun to talk about.

02:24:07.400 --> 02:24:12.400
We need more of your karaoke revolution skills.

02:24:12.400 --> 02:24:14.400
Oh, come on, be our diva.

02:24:14.400 --> 02:24:21.400
By the way, I gotta bring that to work, actually, karaoke revolution and DDR, because apparently the Blockbuster...

02:24:21.400 --> 02:24:27.620
And these look like this blockbuster sort of, I don't really want to say the convention,

02:24:27.620 --> 02:24:30.840
like sales conference type thing that's in Texas.

02:24:30.840 --> 02:24:35.760
And they're bringing DDR and Curiosity Revolution to play.

02:24:35.760 --> 02:24:38.800
So they want to try it out here to see what it is.

02:24:38.800 --> 02:24:39.800
So I gotta bring it in.

02:24:39.800 --> 02:24:40.800
Yay me.

02:24:40.800 --> 02:24:45.320
Alright, we'll be back after this break.

02:24:45.320 --> 02:24:48.280
And just so you guys know I ain't screwing with ya, I'm starting off this break with

02:24:48.280 --> 02:24:51.400
some erotic so we better start seeing some good questions for ask orange

02:24:51.400 --> 02:24:53.400
We'll be back after this.

02:25:51.400 --> 02:25:56.400
Gonna take your fear away, flyin' like a snow-ed dove out of the temple of love

02:25:57.400 --> 02:26:04.400
Come into the temple of love, together we'll rage through the heavens above

02:26:04.400 --> 02:26:07.400
Come to the temple of the heart of your soul

02:26:07.400 --> 02:26:11.400
We can join the devil's measure

02:28:37.400 --> 02:28:39.400
Why do

02:29:37.400 --> 02:29:50.400
Come on, come on, do the locomotion with me

02:29:50.400 --> 02:29:53.400
Come on, you got the notion

02:29:53.400 --> 02:29:56.400
Do it back, yeah

02:29:56.400 --> 02:30:00.400
Everybody's doing a brand new dance now

02:30:00.400 --> 02:30:03.400
Come on, baby, do the locomotion

02:30:03.400 --> 02:30:07.400
I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now

02:30:07.400 --> 02:30:10.400
Come on baby, do the love, come on

02:30:10.400 --> 02:30:14.400
My little baby says it's you and me

02:30:14.400 --> 02:30:17.400
It's easy to love if you're everything

02:30:17.400 --> 02:30:22.400
So come on, come on, do the love, come on, share with me

02:30:22.400 --> 02:30:26.400
We gotta swing our heads round

02:30:26.400 --> 02:30:31.400
Come on baby, do the love, come on, do the love

02:30:31.400 --> 02:30:42.400
Now that you can do it, we'll make a treat Now, come on baby, we'll do it, do it, do it

02:30:42.400 --> 02:30:46.400
Now, just turn the motion like the way we treat

02:30:46.400 --> 02:30:54.400
Now, come on baby, do it, do it, do it Now we're losing control, a little bit of

02:30:54.400 --> 02:31:01.400
Hi, this is Mel B of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute of my girls, I'm going to

02:31:24.400 --> 02:31:27.400
and Melvie can join us on all the fun together.

02:31:27.400 --> 02:31:32.400
Hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to

02:31:32.400 --> 02:31:36.400
and still the fun is just as great. It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

02:31:36.400 --> 02:31:41.400
Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

02:31:41.400 --> 02:31:46.400
Here we are back on Orange Lounge Radio and I'm surprised we didn't get a lot of comment from the chat room.

02:31:46.400 --> 02:31:53.400
Usually they give us some shit there when we play like, you know, songs that are kind of weird

02:31:53.400 --> 02:31:57.060
and we played the locomotion there from dance maniacs nobody said anything about

02:31:57.060 --> 02:32:00.280
it or at least maybe I missed it they might have said it but I missed it

02:32:00.280 --> 02:32:07.960
anyway let's get into some ask orange lounge we got some time to fill here

02:32:07.960 --> 02:32:15.680
tonight so we're gonna get into this and then I might try to do a little bit of

02:32:15.680 --> 02:32:18.480
news too if we kind of run out of questions but it looks like a lot of you

02:32:18.480 --> 02:32:22.800
guys have some questions you've got to know the answer to so we'll get into

02:32:22.800 --> 02:32:34.440
that? Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question. What will we find out this week?

02:32:34.440 --> 02:32:40.560
On Orange Lounge Radio, you can tell that we need to fill a little time. Thirty minutes

02:32:40.560 --> 02:32:50.800
to be exact. So I hope this segment is long tonight. Slow news week, what can we say?

02:32:50.800 --> 02:32:52.640
Illusion says, question.

02:32:53.640 --> 02:32:55.440
Here is a question for Sky.

02:32:55.440 --> 02:32:57.080
Oh God, I should have known this subject

02:32:57.080 --> 02:32:58.640
would come up tonight.

02:32:58.640 --> 02:33:02.880
How could you not absolutely love Sin City with a passion?

02:33:02.880 --> 02:33:05.300
He's referencing a live journal post I made earlier

02:33:05.300 --> 02:33:08.560
this week that said simply, Sin City,

02:33:08.560 --> 02:33:11.560
all style, little substance.

02:33:11.560 --> 02:33:13.520
First to give the points tonight,

02:33:13.520 --> 02:33:15.420
we'll do a little point counterpoint.

02:33:15.420 --> 02:33:17.560
I will let Loki gush about Sin City.

02:33:17.560 --> 02:33:31.560
Since it was awesome. First of all, it's very stylistic. It did have substance. It had much substance. Very, very much substance.

02:33:31.560 --> 02:33:39.560
Anyways, it was basically the best adaptation of a comic book that's ever been made. They actually didn't even make a screenplay for it. It was done straight from the comic book.

02:33:39.560 --> 02:33:52.560
Um, I loved it, actually, um, my favorite parts were those of, um, I believe it was, the big fat kill was pretty good. I, I liked that with all the, um, horrors with guns. Gotta love that.

02:33:52.560 --> 02:34:08.560
Um, I especially loved, uh, I believe her name was Miho or something like that. She was badass. I mean, that, that, that's something that Jamie would like because, I mean, totally Battle Royale-ish. It's very awesome. You would just be like, this chick kicks ass.

02:34:08.560 --> 02:34:09.560
Okay.

02:34:09.560 --> 02:34:12.560
I would recommend Katie do this movie.

02:34:12.560 --> 02:34:16.560
Because honestly, Miho, she's up there.

02:34:16.560 --> 02:34:17.560
She's up there pretty high.

02:34:17.560 --> 02:34:20.560
Well, I do have a thing for violence, so...

02:34:20.560 --> 02:34:27.560
I mean, she's just like this whore who has samurai swords and protects all the other ones.

02:34:27.560 --> 02:34:30.560
Obviously, but she's just like, you know...

02:34:30.560 --> 02:34:32.560
So she's a good lady that kicks ass?

02:34:32.560 --> 02:34:33.560
Something like that.

02:34:33.560 --> 02:34:37.340
stars and she's chopping off people's limbs and stuff like that and just

02:34:37.340 --> 02:34:44.020
completely badass. Okay. And then then you have Elijah Wood. I've never thought

02:34:44.020 --> 02:34:50.700
I'd see Elijah Wood as creepy as he was. He was a cannibal and just like crazy

02:34:50.700 --> 02:34:54.680
it's just like it almost reminds me of Spider-Man if Spider-Man were a cannibal.

02:34:54.680 --> 02:35:01.660
That's pretty much what Elijah Wood was. Frodo eating the other hobbits. Frodo plus

02:35:01.660 --> 02:35:05.660
Plus Harry Potter equals scare, seriously, because it looked like Harry Potter.

02:35:31.660 --> 02:35:36.660
Why do you bring your kids to see this movie? It's a rated R movie, it's not meant for kids. Why do you bring your kids?

02:35:36.660 --> 02:35:38.660
Because they're stupid and don't read up on stuff to begin with.

02:35:38.660 --> 02:35:47.660
And then later on you're gonna say, well I think it's all about Sin City, so that's why they ripped off Mommy's arm, and now I'm suing, you know, um, Miramax.

02:35:49.660 --> 02:35:50.660
Fuck that.

02:35:50.660 --> 02:35:53.660
It's the world of people who can't think for themselves.

02:35:53.660 --> 02:35:59.780
Alright, my turn. I did not dislike Sin City, so I don't want to be labeled as a Sin City

02:35:59.780 --> 02:36:04.100
hater, because I did enjoy the movie, but I also do not believe that this, like, I have

02:36:04.100 --> 02:36:08.580
seen at least three different people declare this the best movie ever made, and I definitely

02:36:08.580 --> 02:36:12.300
don't think it's the best movie ever made. I think I'll see a better movie this year.

02:36:12.300 --> 02:36:15.820
But it's a good movie still! I don't really want to see it again, but I thought it was

02:36:15.820 --> 02:36:19.420
a good movie, and I just recommended it to Jamie, so, you know, I don't have bad things

02:36:19.420 --> 02:36:23.820
to say about the movie but here were my issue with it it was very stylistic like

02:36:23.820 --> 02:36:30.060
it looked so sexy the look was so great the acting really ruined some of it for

02:36:30.060 --> 02:36:36.420
me because you had some people that were acting one way like kind of that I don't

02:36:36.420 --> 02:36:40.460
know that element of the 30s you know noir style and some folks that just

02:36:40.460 --> 02:36:45.460
couldn't act like we're trying to take the comic book lines like really

02:36:45.460 --> 02:36:50.840
literally I think and we're kind of almost camping, campy with it. And I would put probably

02:36:50.840 --> 02:36:57.740
Britney Murphy in that category and the chick that played Goldie or whatever and the other,

02:36:57.740 --> 02:37:03.140
I don't know, there's that Goldie chick. It's basically most of the women except for the

02:37:03.140 --> 02:37:07.260
one who played like the queen whore, like she was like queen of the whores. She was

02:37:07.260 --> 02:37:12.140
bad ass, okay? She was pretty cool. But a lot of the acting just kind of didn't do it

02:37:12.140 --> 02:37:16.800
for me so that was just me and you know I just thought it went on like really

02:37:16.800 --> 02:37:19.980
really really long and I kind of would have thought a comic book movie would

02:37:19.980 --> 02:37:22.740
have been a little more fast-paced like there were some scenes in movie that

02:37:22.740 --> 02:37:26.220
were very fast-paced I was like when it was like really fast-paced I enjoyed it

02:37:26.220 --> 02:37:30.620
but a lot of it was just very like but don't get me wrong I didn't think it was

02:37:30.620 --> 02:37:36.660
bad I just didn't think it was like big oh my god greatest thing ever anyway um

02:37:36.660 --> 02:37:47.540
Let's see. More questions. We do have more questions. You can still ask questions if

02:37:47.540 --> 02:37:53.140
you want you guys. Let's see. Dark Knight wanted to follow up to something he was

02:37:53.140 --> 02:37:56.180
saying in his F.U. earlier. He said something about an employee stealing

02:37:56.180 --> 02:38:00.340
from the store. Someone got caught last night, ended up only being two cashiers

02:38:00.340 --> 02:38:06.300
that night, and I had to work in women's, so not fun. And he's asking,

02:38:06.300 --> 02:38:09.520
So are we having a slow cam night? Yeah, we are having a slow cam night. Sorry guys

02:38:09.520 --> 02:38:15.800
That's because our special guest is hiding from the cam. She's stealing my stick. I you will we're gonna

02:38:15.800 --> 02:38:18.100
I'm supposed to be the mysterious

02:38:18.900 --> 02:38:24.380
Co-host here's the interesting thing. Is that in about two or three weeks now?

02:38:24.380 --> 02:38:27.100
We're not that far away Orange Lounge radio studio is moving

02:38:27.100 --> 02:38:31.900
So in the new studio, the webcam will be set up completely differently. So that's my head

02:38:31.900 --> 02:38:36.500
you know it'll be interesting to see what we set it up in the new studio but

02:38:36.500 --> 02:38:39.420
on my head and have the Sakura cam well the weird thing is we're not gonna be

02:38:39.420 --> 02:38:43.460
able to do the itoy cam either so I'll have to get creative who cares I have

02:38:43.460 --> 02:38:47.340
another webcam I just don't use it because I didn't like it I haven't

02:38:47.340 --> 02:38:52.820
really thought the logistics of the webcam out yet so we'll see anyway

02:38:52.820 --> 02:38:58.660
question from LXL doobs why haven't we gotten orange lounge radio t-shirts yet

02:38:58.660 --> 02:39:06.300
pay for them the problem with t-shirts is that in order to get t-shirts you

02:39:06.300 --> 02:39:11.100
have to buy a bunch of them up front and if you're not able to sell them then you

02:39:11.100 --> 02:39:14.440
have to take a loss and none of us are financially able to take a loss right

02:39:14.440 --> 02:39:18.420
now what we may do I do want to do t-shirts I think we have enough of a

02:39:18.420 --> 02:39:22.100
following where we could get enough small t-shirts but it would be the type

02:39:22.100 --> 02:39:25.420
of thing where it's like pre-order and I know a lot of folks don't like the

02:39:25.420 --> 02:39:29.260
pre-order thing but that's just so that we wouldn't lose any money you know and

02:39:29.260 --> 02:39:32.580
we'd only order enough shirts for those that would pre-order it so if we do do

02:39:32.580 --> 02:39:36.400
shirts in the future which we are wanting to do before e3 so you may see

02:39:36.400 --> 02:39:40.100
this coming in the next month it would probably be something where it's

02:39:40.100 --> 02:39:46.540
pre-order only but we'll post more deals details to the website when we know more

02:39:46.540 --> 02:39:50.820
information and we also have to get some shirt designs we don't know exactly what

02:39:50.820 --> 02:40:00.320
we want right now olr that hot that's pretty good that hot we'll see excuse me

02:40:00.320 --> 02:40:05.760
mpq wants to know what should I do if my beatmania 2dx arrives before my flip-top

02:40:05.760 --> 02:40:12.480
drive does or flip-top ps2 does wait longer you shouldn't have bought a

02:40:12.480 --> 02:40:22.140
a modded ps2 to begin with that's pretty stupid only buy the real thing um look

02:40:22.140 --> 02:40:25.100
at the manual and look how pretty the manual does try to translate the

02:40:25.100 --> 02:40:28.360
Japanese in the manual that'll be fun and see those of us who actually have a

02:40:28.360 --> 02:40:35.040
jps2 will be enjoying their 2dx because we bought a jps2 oh we just had our

02:40:35.040 --> 02:40:39.560
typo of the night in the chat room somebody was trying to say this dark

02:40:39.560 --> 02:40:46.560
Night said orange lounge radio is almost classified as a klut meant to say cult but say klut.

02:40:49.840 --> 02:40:56.840
We just need t-shirts with typos on them. Shut up klut. Lemon Lime Jump says I plan

02:41:02.420 --> 02:41:08.060
on gathering up a posse to get a DDR machine put in at my college. What's a good mix to

02:41:08.060 --> 02:41:12.740
get I guess everyone I guess everyone will have a different opinion but what

02:41:12.740 --> 02:41:17.660
does everyone in the studio think um my opinion is that extreme is kind of

02:41:17.660 --> 02:41:22.060
hoard like you can go almost everywhere and find an extreme so really for me

02:41:22.060 --> 02:41:26.140
it's all about the retro at this point so I think a good DDR mix it would be

02:41:26.140 --> 02:41:30.420
fun to have retro so either fourth plus I think fourth plus is definitely a

02:41:30.420 --> 02:41:37.340
great one to have fifth mix or third Korean both plus third plus third plus

02:41:37.340 --> 02:41:40.520
is a kind of expensive the third mix third Koreans you get pretty cheap can't

02:41:40.520 --> 02:41:46.280
you second mix was fun yeah second mix had step battle in it and nothing is as

02:41:46.280 --> 02:41:50.120
cool as step battle I would urge you to do just whatever is cheap and affordable

02:41:50.120 --> 02:41:54.560
for your college which I believe third Koreans the cheapest um so that or fourth

02:41:54.560 --> 02:41:57.680
plus a fifth mix would be a good deal too because there were a lot of songs in

02:41:57.680 --> 02:42:02.000
fifth mix that didn't show up anywhere else so I think fifth mix is definitely

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:06.840
something good to check out um but don't get I mean if you of course you could

02:42:06.840 --> 02:42:10.680
always get an extreme but the thing is is that everybody has an extreme so it

02:42:10.680 --> 02:42:14.000
really depends and I don't know what kind of area you live in but check out

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:18.800
DDR freak machine locations put in your zip code and see what kind of machines

02:42:18.800 --> 02:42:22.800
are in your area and if you have three or four extreme machines within ten

02:42:22.800 --> 02:42:26.880
miles well then go for something different and that'll kind of lure

02:42:26.880 --> 02:42:29.780
people to the college it'll lure the people to play those extreme machines

02:42:29.780 --> 02:42:35.140
to you know old stuff is new again I'm actually surprised nobody in our chat

02:42:35.140 --> 02:42:40.500
room said F that get in the groove which really would be another option honestly

02:42:40.500 --> 02:42:43.980
that might be something you might want to see if there's interest in I'm not

02:42:43.980 --> 02:42:48.460
gonna dog on in the group but you know lemon lime jump just wants to clarify

02:42:48.460 --> 02:42:52.260
this is Pensacola unfortunately I don't know the Pensacola area I wasn't what

02:42:52.260 --> 02:42:56.900
school I've been to Florida once I don't I lived an hour from Pensacola what

02:42:56.900 --> 02:43:01.020
school I don't know I'm wait I'll wait for lemon lime jump first I'll talk to

02:43:01.020 --> 02:43:04.900
lemon line jump just PME okay but here's the thing I've been in Florida for a

02:43:04.900 --> 02:43:08.900
a whopping one hour in my life and it was a layover when I was seven years old.

02:43:08.900 --> 02:43:12.900
Alright, anyway.

02:43:12.900 --> 02:43:16.900
Flaronay says, do you guys still have the

02:43:16.900 --> 02:43:20.900
Let Them Move MP3? If so, can you play it at the end of this show

02:43:20.900 --> 02:43:24.900
please? Do you have that? Loki, wasn't that your thing

02:43:24.900 --> 02:43:28.900
to let them move the cow doing the Let Them Move? Do you remember that?

02:43:28.900 --> 02:43:32.900
Do you have that? Can you find it? Can you see if you still have it so I can

02:43:32.900 --> 02:43:37.780
play it okay see if you have that we can fit that in for you Florina it's pretty

02:43:37.780 --> 02:43:43.340
funny and we haven't done that joke in months Rama says seriously are we gonna

02:43:43.340 --> 02:43:49.260
see some orange on his radio t-shirts yes we want to do the t-shirts I we will

02:43:49.260 --> 02:43:53.380
have something up within the next couple weeks we just need a shirt design so we

02:43:53.380 --> 02:43:58.820
need some folks to design a shirt for us hint hint hint maybe we'll do a contest

02:43:58.820 --> 02:44:02.820
we have CDs to give away we could do a contest we don't we have anime

02:44:02.820 --> 02:44:06.460
screeners to that have to get given away we got the apple seed prize pack still

02:44:06.460 --> 02:44:10.660
we got to give away at some point huh I mean we'll do a we'll do a contest that

02:44:10.660 --> 02:44:13.060
might be fun

02:44:17.020 --> 02:44:21.820
lemon-lime jump just wanted to clarify it's UWF is the school she goes to

02:44:21.820 --> 02:44:29.700
University of West Florida. I guess, yeah. RPGKing7 says question, how are you guys able

02:44:29.700 --> 02:44:37.220
to get into E3? DDRFreak. DDRFreak is a registered business, so Dark Soccer is able to get in

02:44:37.220 --> 02:44:45.420
that way. Loki? I'm a game, I do game sales at my company. I mean, I don't think you can

02:44:45.420 --> 02:44:51.300
get any more in the business than that. Unfortunately that leaves me out in the cold this year.

02:44:51.300 --> 02:44:55.120
year I had some buddies at a particular gaming company that we talked an awful

02:44:55.120 --> 02:45:00.440
lot about on this station that helped me get into e3 and helped Loki get in as

02:45:00.440 --> 02:45:03.200
well unfortunately I don't have that luxury this year so I'm kind of on my

02:45:03.200 --> 02:45:07.800
own so I don't know if I'm going to e3 this year I will find out this week so

02:45:07.800 --> 02:45:11.320
we'll have something on that on Sunday cuz I'm gonna send in the paperwork this

02:45:11.320 --> 02:45:15.360
week so we'll see what happens but actually if I do get into e3 it'll be

02:45:15.360 --> 02:45:18.540
strictly because of orange launch radio which is kind of cool but we are an

02:45:18.540 --> 02:45:30.780
official business as well now, too, so. Anyway. SSJ100Matt. Which are better video game movies

02:45:30.780 --> 02:45:36.500
or comic book based movies? By the way, you've got to play Girls Butts. Girls Butts is so

02:45:36.500 --> 02:45:43.060
two weeks ago. Well, we'll see. We'll see about the Girls Butts thing. What are better

02:45:43.060 --> 02:45:49.660
video game- oh, which is better? Video game based movies, or comic book based movies?

02:45:49.660 --> 02:45:53.180
On the whole, I would say comic book based movies have been better.

02:45:53.180 --> 02:46:03.180
I would definitely second that. That's like comparing a BB gun with a thermonuclear

02:46:03.180 --> 02:46:11.480
warhead. There's no comparison. I mean, when you look at the old school Batman,

02:46:11.480 --> 02:46:16.240
I mean, that alone, right there. And then maybe, um, what else? The Spider-Man was really

02:46:16.240 --> 02:46:21.520
good. It's comic book movies are awesome. And, unfortunately, um, you know, the, uh,

02:46:21.520 --> 02:46:27.600
um, of course there have been bad comic book movies, Catwoman.

02:46:27.600 --> 02:46:31.880
You know, that wasn't, that wasn't the comic book's fault, that was the director's fault.

02:46:31.880 --> 02:46:37.680
And we know who that director is, and we are trying to stop them as we speak, you know.

02:46:37.680 --> 02:46:41.400
That wasn't Uwe Boll, the directed Catwoman, was it?

02:46:41.400 --> 02:46:43.400
I think it was.

02:46:43.400 --> 02:46:46.480
You sh- oh. You sure?

02:46:46.480 --> 02:46:48.960
Let me check. I'm gonna check.

02:46:48.960 --> 02:46:51.480
I'm almost positive.

02:46:51.480 --> 02:46:54.520
You do that. You check.

02:46:54.520 --> 02:46:55.520
Go to the database.

02:46:55.520 --> 02:46:58.080
But find the let them move thing first.

02:46:58.080 --> 02:47:01.440
We need that.

02:47:01.440 --> 02:47:06.440
I can't is not a term I understand.

02:47:06.440 --> 02:47:13.760
Alright, we're running out of questions here, no more questions at least I see for Ask Orange

02:47:13.760 --> 02:47:16.380
Lounge unless I missed something, I don't think so.

02:47:16.380 --> 02:47:20.000
So we're going to go ahead and close up the old mailbag there and what we're going to

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:23.560
do now is we're going to take a quick break, just a quick two song break and we're going

02:47:23.560 --> 02:47:27.200
to come back and a couple of quick other little stories and notes and then we're going to

02:47:27.200 --> 02:47:28.200
end tonight's show.

02:47:28.200 --> 02:47:34.240
So we will be back after this featuring a very, very old DDR song and a very, very new

02:47:34.240 --> 02:47:36.240
DDR song.

02:47:36.240 --> 02:47:43.240
We'll be back after this.

02:48:06.240 --> 02:48:08.240
Wai-ai-ai-ai

02:48:08.240 --> 02:48:11.740
You keep a pocket full of green, green dollars

02:48:11.740 --> 02:48:14.240
I love you, boy, it's the time

02:48:15.240 --> 02:48:18.740
You're very hard, you snooze like a young fella

02:48:18.740 --> 02:48:22.240
Take me overnight

02:48:22.240 --> 02:48:24.240
Boom, boom, boom, boom

02:48:24.240 --> 02:48:25.740
Something like a boom-boom

02:48:25.740 --> 02:48:27.740
Boom, boom, boom, boom

02:48:27.740 --> 02:48:29.240
Back to order

02:48:29.240 --> 02:48:31.240
Boom, boom, boom, boom

02:48:31.240 --> 02:48:32.740
Pushing all the buttons

02:50:32.740 --> 02:50:50.820
I don't even know if anyone gets that promo anymore.

02:50:50.820 --> 02:50:54.700
That was when we were at the house for the show.

02:50:54.700 --> 02:50:56.460
Uh huh, that was the first studio.

02:50:56.460 --> 02:51:02.140
And they were watching Hentai on the main TV, and I walk into the room and the first

02:51:02.140 --> 02:51:08.920
thing I see is animated ass all over the screen like oh ass and then we made the

02:51:08.920 --> 02:51:14.800
problem suddenly it was a promo yeah all right um just so you guys know we

02:51:14.800 --> 02:51:18.400
actually found something that we promised we would play so we're gonna do

02:51:18.400 --> 02:51:22.840
one other song here for you guys so enjoy this you should get a kick out of

02:51:22.840 --> 02:51:31.360
this or not this is NMR featuring Jack Jack Jackazid Jackazid enjoy

02:51:52.840 --> 02:52:00.840
The money jacker, throw to the sideline, the mic's a dead line, but case they rewind, use them as guidelines.

02:52:00.840 --> 02:52:02.840
A hip raffle like the way you do it, what you do with it?

02:52:02.840 --> 02:52:04.840
It ain't lookin' like a toothpick.

02:52:04.840 --> 02:52:06.840
Can't get with instrumental record power.

02:52:06.840 --> 02:52:08.840
My lyrical tongue will be like Cinderella's power.

02:52:08.840 --> 02:52:37.260
That sounds like a dying cow at the end.

02:52:37.260 --> 02:52:41.740
Oh Wilber, it's just a sprain, although that's a horse, but whatever.

02:52:41.740 --> 02:52:44.700
That was an old fortune cookie.

02:52:44.700 --> 02:52:45.700
Like years ago.

02:52:45.700 --> 02:52:48.780
That was like from episode 4.

02:52:48.780 --> 02:52:51.100
That feels weird, like, I don't think it's that old, but...

02:52:51.100 --> 02:52:55.860
Oh yeah, it is that old, because this was when I was still not eating beef.

02:52:55.860 --> 02:53:04.180
And we went to, um, we were going to Panda Express, and I had that nasty eggplant crap,

02:53:04.180 --> 02:53:06.700
and then we were trying to think of what we were going to do, and I was like, this eggplant

02:53:06.700 --> 02:53:11.020
makes me think of dead horse because it was all rubber. Oh, oh, the Wilbur thing. Yeah,

02:53:11.020 --> 02:53:13.940
yeah, yeah. That was an old-ass Portuguese. That was an old Portuguese. I thought you

02:53:13.940 --> 02:53:22.240
meant the let them move thing. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. The, the horse thing. I always

02:53:22.240 --> 02:53:26.020
love doing this. We bring this up once every couple months or so, and since the, you know,

02:53:26.020 --> 02:53:30.420
the show's gotten some additional new listeners lately, we'll do this one more time here.

02:53:30.420 --> 02:53:34.460
We used to do these, but they kind of took a lot of work, so we don't really do them

02:53:34.460 --> 02:53:41.460
so much anymore, but we used to do these little flashback promos, they're hilarious.

02:53:41.460 --> 02:53:47.460
Take a look back at episode number one.

02:53:47.460 --> 02:53:50.460
Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:53:50.460 --> 02:53:52.460
Attention to parents at Golf Land.

02:53:52.460 --> 02:53:54.460
This goes for not just Roseland Golf Land, but any golf land.

02:53:54.460 --> 02:53:55.460
Any arcade.

02:53:55.460 --> 02:53:57.460
Jamie circulates a lot.

02:53:57.460 --> 02:53:58.460
She gets around, Jamie.

02:53:58.460 --> 02:54:00.460
Oh yeah, baby.

02:54:00.460 --> 02:54:05.460
If you don't mother your child, Jamie will.

02:54:05.460 --> 02:54:07.460
Yes, I will spank your child.

02:54:07.460 --> 02:54:09.460
If you're not going to do your job, God damn it, I will.

02:54:09.460 --> 02:54:13.960
Join us every Sunday night from 7 o'clock until 9 o'clock.

02:54:13.960 --> 02:54:16.960
Yeah, you see how old that is? That's when we were on this old schedule there.

02:54:16.960 --> 02:54:18.960
So, very interesting there.

02:54:18.960 --> 02:54:21.960
Listen to how horrible our microphones were, too.

02:54:21.960 --> 02:54:23.460
I was using the headset.

02:54:23.460 --> 02:54:26.460
You could hear Irene in the background. She sounded like she was in a tin can.

02:54:26.460 --> 02:54:27.460
You know, like,

02:54:27.460 --> 02:54:29.960
What is going on, you guys?

02:54:29.960 --> 02:54:35.960
I was using the headset and I ended up with like a migraine by the end of the show.

02:54:35.960 --> 02:54:38.960
Remember I passed out in the show?

02:54:38.960 --> 02:54:42.960
That was terrible. We were in the front. We were in the living room.

02:54:42.960 --> 02:54:46.960
That was certainly fun. And then I went to L.A.

02:54:46.960 --> 02:54:50.960
You did. So you were gone for a couple weeks. Let's do one more flashback.

02:54:50.960 --> 02:54:54.960
These are kind of fun. I like the flashbacks.

02:54:54.960 --> 02:54:58.960
So you guys can respect the roots of Orange Lounge Radio. Let's do a flashback from episode...

02:54:58.960 --> 02:55:02.960
1, 2, 3, 4. Let's do a flashback from episode 4.

02:55:02.960 --> 02:55:12.960
Next week on the show we're going to have our very first special guest.

02:55:12.960 --> 02:55:18.460
We're actually having over Melody and Mel B and they're going to be our guests on the

02:55:18.460 --> 02:55:22.960
show and I get to clean house all week to be ready for them.

02:55:22.960 --> 02:55:23.960
Oh God.

02:55:23.960 --> 02:55:27.120
I have to move everything out and deliver because this room is cramped as it is when

02:55:27.120 --> 02:55:28.120
we do the show here.

02:55:28.120 --> 02:55:32.060
I'd have to do so and they're quite tricky and moist.

02:55:32.060 --> 02:55:34.060
How are you feeling a little moist tonight, Jamie?

02:55:34.060 --> 02:55:36.060
Oh, every night on the show.

02:55:36.060 --> 02:55:41.060
As Irene makes his face.

02:55:41.060 --> 02:55:44.060
Orange Lounge Radio makes you moist as a snake.

02:55:44.060 --> 02:55:51.060
Join us every Sunday night from 7 p.m. until 9 p.m. Pacific Standard Time for the Orange Lounge.

02:55:51.060 --> 02:55:53.060
Jamie was moist.

02:55:55.060 --> 02:55:57.060
And I still am!

02:55:57.060 --> 02:55:59.060
I remember she got pissed off about that one too.

02:55:59.060 --> 02:56:00.060
I did.

02:56:00.060 --> 02:56:05.660
she's like, DON'T PUT THAT IN THE BOWBO, YOU CAN'T, WHY DID YOU DO THAT, ROB, WHY?

02:56:06.020 --> 02:56:09.020
But now she goes over that, and I, I...

02:56:09.020 --> 02:56:12.320
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob...

02:56:14.100 --> 02:56:14.600
Rob!

02:56:14.840 --> 02:56:15.340
Yes?

02:56:15.740 --> 02:56:18.540
RrrooooOOOoooOOoRrrooooooRrreEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEe figured

02:56:18.540 --> 02:56:23.280
Loki, before we finish up the show, give us some more, uh, PSP hacking news,

02:56:23.280 --> 02:56:25.460
because this is what you're all about ever since you got a PSP,

02:56:25.460 --> 02:56:28.120
I noticed you were watching a video earlier, yeah, tell us about that too.

02:56:28.120 --> 02:56:34.060
That was the great game launcher you honestly have to like seriously twist a PSP to get to launch a game

02:56:34.060 --> 02:56:38.420
And I don't know about you, but who twists a fucking you know console system wipeout

02:56:39.340 --> 02:56:44.100
You need to twist the damn game for wipeout. I don't twist it when I play wipeout

02:56:44.100 --> 02:56:49.580
This isn't like some sort of jog con type thing. This is you know a game system

02:56:49.580 --> 02:56:51.820
You don't try to twist it of course. It's gonna break

02:56:52.340 --> 02:56:54.340
Not meant to twist

02:56:54.340 --> 02:56:56.340
Yeah, people are retarded.

02:56:56.340 --> 02:57:03.340
Anyways, no, um, so yeah, apparently the, um, PSP IRC thing has been slashdotted, so that went that site.

02:57:03.340 --> 02:57:09.340
And same with the PSP browser, that has been slashdotted as well, so that site's down.

02:57:11.340 --> 02:57:12.340
What's this?

02:57:14.340 --> 02:57:16.340
Haha, funny.

02:57:16.340 --> 02:57:24.340
oh man honestly who the hell does this kind of stuff is what I want to know

02:57:24.340 --> 02:57:33.020
um in other news though I will be reporting this later it has been done in

02:57:33.020 --> 02:57:38.980
the first alpha will be coming up next month that's right Linux is on the DS go

02:57:38.980 --> 02:57:43.940
Linux if it runs with electricity there will be Linux on it

02:57:43.940 --> 02:57:47.860
Linux for the toaster. I want Linux for the toaster.

02:57:47.860 --> 02:57:51.780
And from what I read, iTunes. iTunes for the PSP.

02:57:51.780 --> 02:57:58.980
I will never understand what the charm is about being able to install Linux

02:57:58.980 --> 02:58:05.040
on insert system here. I don't understand, like what is that just because people

02:58:05.040 --> 02:58:08.620
think they're gonna be able to run all the Linux programs on it and everything

02:58:08.620 --> 02:58:12.180
so I don't understand. Why do people try to install Linux on like

02:58:12.180 --> 02:58:15.740
you know what was the one we had that the fish on the wall had a

02:58:15.740 --> 02:58:19.940
Linux installed on it? What the hell is that? You know what I want to do?

02:58:19.940 --> 02:58:24.060
And I realized this the other day when I was looking at my PSP. I'm like what the hell is this

02:58:24.060 --> 02:58:24.620
button?

02:58:24.620 --> 02:58:27.860
What is this thing? What is this little thing on the top here?

02:58:27.860 --> 02:58:31.740
It's an infrared port. So you know what you can do? You can use this as a remote.

02:58:31.740 --> 02:58:35.260
I want a program on here where I can turn off TVs with the PSP.

02:58:35.260 --> 02:58:40.100
So you can walk around Walmart

02:58:40.100 --> 02:58:44.020
just you know getting electronics out oh i'm just i'm trying out a psp

02:58:44.020 --> 02:58:46.420
click click click click all the tvs are going off

02:58:46.420 --> 02:58:48.580
actually i want to get what didn't you order one of those keychains i thought

02:58:48.580 --> 02:58:51.140
you're going to order the keychain that shuts them all off

02:58:51.140 --> 02:58:54.260
no i never got around to that damn we need to get one and we need to figure

02:58:54.260 --> 02:58:58.100
out how to increase the strength of this and go in the best buy

02:58:58.100 --> 02:59:00.820
watch the magic

02:59:01.780 --> 02:59:07.220
like an emp i don't remember i don't remember what it does but it's

02:59:07.220 --> 02:59:09.860
like a little little thing that you put on your keychain and what it does is

02:59:09.860 --> 02:59:14.760
basically cycles through like a hundred different popular televisions and their

02:59:14.760 --> 02:59:19.880
power off signal that's awesome I want one so you can like go in if the TV's

02:59:19.880 --> 02:59:23.360
too loud at a restaurant or whatever you just get out your little keychain and if

02:59:23.360 --> 02:59:27.420
you hold it for 15 seconds eventually the TV will turn off I still want the

02:59:27.420 --> 02:59:31.820
the portable EMP so I can aim it at people's cell phones while they're

02:59:31.820 --> 02:59:39.040
driving I was thinking I need to find the the actual Wi-Fi thing in here and I

02:59:39.040 --> 02:59:43.080
it's been taken apart before and find the Wi-Fi but I want to like make a

02:59:43.080 --> 02:59:47.160
little me satellite dish so go with this you know except on a tripod so I can

02:59:47.160 --> 02:59:51.000
connect you know it's a hot spots there like a mile away or something that'd be

02:59:51.000 --> 02:59:55.880
fun this is great though I mean honestly I didn't know that some people had

02:59:55.880 --> 02:59:59.120
unprotected networks and all I did is walk around outside today you know kept

02:59:59.120 --> 03:00:03.640
hitting you know scan scan and I get like I found three different networks

03:00:03.640 --> 03:00:09.340
one with the password on it. Well, actually two with passwords, one that's not. So, you

03:00:09.340 --> 03:00:16.900
know, it's sort of like, you know, a dumb person's version of, you know, I forget, war

03:00:16.900 --> 03:00:21.260
driving. You should walk around the complex and just, you just look like you're playing

03:00:21.260 --> 03:00:26.540
your PSP and scan. But can you download files from the networks? No, not on the PSP yet.

03:00:26.540 --> 03:00:31.540
Not yet, but I was reading some other things today on the site. There's a cord out there

03:01:01.540 --> 03:01:10.220
on my PSP. Alright, anyway, more PSP pirating and hacking news to come later on Orange Lounge

03:01:10.220 --> 03:01:15.420
Radio, but for now, that's it, three hours are up. Tune into the podcast if you want

03:01:15.420 --> 03:01:19.620

03:01:19.620 --> 03:01:27.380
thought. Angel, your final thought. I need to recharge my PSP, er, not PSP, DS. Yeah,

03:01:27.380 --> 03:01:36.100
brain's not working. Bye. Julie. I want to kill some Sims. It's fun. Killing Sims is

03:01:36.100 --> 03:01:45.180
fun. Uh, Loki. Now do you have the, um, the, uh, what was it, the college update for, um,

I've eaten meatballs in Sweden And pork chops in Peru

03:03:24.940 --> 03:03:31.940

03:04:10.940 --> 03:04:24.540
Alright, that's going to do it for tonight's show everybody, thanks a lot for listening

03:04:24.540 --> 03:04:27.280
and supporting us as always, we appreciate your support.

03:04:27.280 --> 03:04:30.900
We are going to go from our basic broadcast, or I'm sorry, back from our live broadcast

03:04:30.900 --> 03:04:33.860
mode to our basic broadcast, so you're going to get disconnected, but just reconnect to

03:04:33.860 --> 03:04:38.940
the stream in about 15 seconds to resume listening to all your favorite ER, 2DX, and Dance Mania

03:04:38.940 --> 03:04:39.940
favorites.

03:04:39.940 --> 03:04:45.760
you guys. In the studio we have actually a clock here that actually shows us the

03:04:45.760 --> 03:04:49.360
time and it's like a bar clock and it lights up this like neon blue it's very

03:04:49.360 --> 03:04:52.180
pretty and when all lights are off it makes everything shine blue which is

03:04:52.180 --> 03:04:56.480
very nice but the clock was always an hour ahead so whenever we would look at

03:04:56.480 --> 03:05:01.120
it we'd have to go okay well it says you know the show actually ends at 10 30 but

03:05:01.120 --> 03:05:05.160
now thanks to Daylight Savings Time we didn't we didn't have to get up there

03:05:05.160 --> 03:05:11.960
and change the clock. The clock's right now. Laziness prevails again. And on that

03:05:11.960 --> 03:05:15.920
thought, have a great night everybody. We'll see you next week. Reconnect in 15

03:05:15.920 --> 03:05:18.200
seconds
