The following live program is a special presentation of Orange Lounge Radio
Orange Lounge Radio is presented in the TMI sound format.
Oh, God.
Call me Daddy.
Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.
Orange Lounge may contain plenty of... Just kidding.
Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.
Well, isn't that special?
Orange Lounge Radio Live is a fully interactive program via our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com And now, here are your hosts for Orange Lounge Radio Live, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
We are live!
This is episode number 138 for this, April the 3rd of 2005.
You're tuned in to the B-Mani Scene's most sexy radio station of all things video gaming and B-Mani.
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.
In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm,
Miss Jamie Summers, you might know her as DarkSakura.
I have a mouth full of nuts.
Hot!
Macadamia.
Oh, not hot.
Not hot.
But yummy.
But yummy, very yummy.
Yes, very yummy.
Sweet and not too salty.
Great.
Also in this corner, say hello to our tech massa slash the official, I'm giving him a new title tonight, the official Orange Lounge pirate.
Arrrr!
Loki.
Why am I a pirate?
Arrrr!
I don't know, because you do pirate-like things.
Because you're always chasing the booty, that's why.
Okay.
How are you, sir?
I'm fine.
Also say hello to a regular guest, DDR Angel.
Hello.
who's feeling as angel as always, I guess, I don't know, and brought me taffy, which is awesome.
You want some, too?
Better hurry up and eat some, because I'm, like, porking through all this taffy, I'm like, food, candy, sugar, it's yummy.
It's okay, Magus decided to steal some last night while I went to bed anyway.
I'm like, okay, I'm going to bed, next thing you know, I, uh, yesterday, or, I mean, this morning, I looked in the bag, I'm like, damn it, half of it's gone!
That's what happens when you put taffy in front of people.
It disappears because taffy is yummy.
Anywho, we should have a heck of a show for you guys tonight.
We found the sound clip we wanted to play very badly for you guys last week.
We played it about a year ago, which is a little bit of a hint as to what it is.
We were talking about a little something something last week, and we finally found the sound clip of it to play tonight.
So it's wonderful.
So we're going to play it for you.
I hope it doesn't have me saying anything, you know.
No, it's actually not a sound clip of you.
It's a sound clip of somebody not even on this show, but that's what makes it funny.
We'll discuss what that is in a little bit, don't worry.
Okay.
I'll give you a hint during break.
Alright.
Speaking of break, let's get to it.
In this break, some random music.
We'll start it off with a little bit of French counting.
So if you want to learn how to count to three, just listen very carefully to the lyrics of the song.
We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
Enjoy!
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
Thanks for watching!

Fly away, to fantasy, spinning round, instantly, a day will wait.
Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 138, in progress here on this lovely April night.
Hope you guys had an interesting April Fool's Day.
I know there were a lot of interesting pranks that were played out there by some various websites.
Of course, one of the biggest sites I'm sure most of us who listen to this program visit once in a while, the DDR Freak.
Thanks for watching!
You know, given the, why am I so loud?
I don't know.
Given the issue with last year, I just sort of sat back and let everybody else do their thing, and I was like, I'm not even gonna.
Seriously, like, last year was a lot, and I couldn't believe some of the response the joke was getting on DDR Freak, because people were like, oh, this is, this sucks compared to last year.
Last year was funny, blah, blah, blah.
And I'm going like, okay, last year was like too much.
I'm like, you cannot outdo what they did last year.
Because what happened last year was like over the top.
Last year, the best part about it was actually getting everything that led up to April Fool's Day.
Because we were all going, becoming power hungry, egomaniac.
It was basically wrestling drama.
Yeah.
Basically, it was like you all got to be WWE members for a minute.
We were all like, screw y'all, we are all admins and we are going to just take over the whole page.
And then all chaos broke loose on New Year's.
The new revolution, oh yeah!
I swear it's Daylight Savings Time if I can win my head.
Oh, I have a lot to say about Daylight Savings Time in a little bit.
But seriously though, last year was so much fun.
This year I'm like, nothing will ever be what last year was.
So I just sat back and let it happen.
This is your puppy.
You can put it in town if you want.
Everybody's saying that it doesn't top last year and it wasn't funny and it wasn't creative and it was too obvious.
But I think what people don't get is that the actual joke was not the fact that DDR Freak was going to turn into In The Groove Freak.
The joke was that...
It was something that they really were going to add to the site and keep.
So it was kind of like one of those not a joke jokes.
Got you twice.
Kind of.
I don't know how to put it.
I thought it was funny.
Now everybody knows I was a very vocal critic of last year's joke.
I did not enjoy last year's joke.
I thought it was way over the top and not necessary.
So I much preferred this year's joke.
I'll tell you what, part of the joke was getting the angry reactions.
That was part of the good thing.
No offense.
No, it's alright.
But last year's joke was stupid.
So I'm glad that this year's joke was a little more tame and kind of funny.
Good thing we didn't do anything.
Yeah, I know.
I'm glad we decided to stay out of the April Fool's thing.
Because, you know, I don't think April Fool's is that funny at all.
No.
Yeah, exactly.
Boycott it.
Uh-huh.
So anyway, where was I?
Oh, yes.
I'm not surprised at all.
I mean, after all.
What?
No, seriously.
You've got... You have my...
Gorgeous voice.
We have our violent and angry young man here.
And then we have you.
Yeah, and then there's the gay.
Yeah, and then we have the gay.
But, I don't know, I'm not surprised at all.
We put enough work into this.
We deserve our kudos, damn it.
Well, thank you for being so humble about everything.
I appreciate it.
We are fucking celebrities.
Okay, the internet loves us.
Well, in all reality, I'm going to come down to, you know, planet Earth here.
I don't know where Jamie's at right now.
I'm going to come down to planet Earth here.
The Earth is beneath me.
I am on the moon now.
Screw you guys.
But it's just funny to see everybody that's nominated for Broadcaster of the Year.
And you've got some really freaking fantabulous stations.
Folks that are probably... I don't know this for sure.
I'm speculating here.
But I'm guessing there's at least one or two stations in there where that is what they do is like 365.
So to be nominated amongst that is like awesome.
I don't even know how to put it.
And it's our listeners who helped us get there.
So, you know, kisses to you guys.
You know what?
I have to make a mention to the chat room.
Yes.
No, we are not going to have Roberto or Jaime.
Thank you.
Yes, no.
We are not going to be in Espanol.
We will be in Esperanto.
Now, if we wanted to do the April Fool's thing, which we don't, having the station in Spanish one day would have been pretty funny.
So we've got to write these down for next year.
Which is incredibly funny because I don't speak any Spanish except for El Telefono Es En Fuego.
Which translates to, the telephone is on fire.
Donde esta el ba√±o?
That's the only one I know.
Where is the bathroom?
Because, you know, if you're going to go visit... We should do this show in Japanese.
If you're going to go visit, like, Tijuana, that's a phrase you need to know.
All right, anyway.
Well, back to the sound clip.
I was going to play this.
Ah, screw the clip.
You might remember we were actually nominated for Best of Life 365 last year in the category of Most Unlikely to Hear on AM FM Radio, which we got nominated in again this year, which is very cool.
So there's two places to nominate us.
However, something very funny happened.
Three of us, all three of us, myself, DarkSakura, and Loki, we all went to the awards ceremony, and this is what happened when we got there.
Okay, most unlikely to hear on AM FM radio.
Is that where we are?
Yes.
Unnamed stream, fluffer tracks, Apollo 11, or Pern Pokemon Radio, P-I-R-N.
Oh, yeah.
Orange Lounge was nominated as well.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, crap.
Oh, yes.
Those guys.
Oh, damn.
What happened to that?
Yeah, this is that Orange Lounge radio crap.
Let me scrape off my shoes so we can get a nomination.
Let's see.
Okay, I can just imagine us getting ready to leave the office.
And I'm half drunk by the time they get to us.
Okay, now, you guys remembered.
We got the fluffer station, the porn station.
We got Pokemon, right?
Okay, that's all we need.
Screw Orange Lounge.
Screw them.
I plan to sit at... I plan... Okay, this is my plan for the awards ceremony.
This year?
This year.
Uh-huh.
Is sitting at the damn table with a bottle of tequila.
Doing shots through the whole thing.
Okay, now.
Listen, though, very carefully.
I'm going to play a little clip of this again.
Listen very carefully.
After they announce Pokemon Radio, which was the last one they read, they start to open the envelope.
Listen very carefully to what happens in the background.
Radio, PIRN.
You distinctly hear Loki back there going, Hey!
Hey!
No!
This doesn't fly.
Hey, lady!
I wasted a tank of gas to get here!
I'm drunk!
Say my name, bitch!
Say my name!
I think you and I were the only ones who drank.
Loki, didn't you kick back a beer or two?
No.
You were driving.
Yeah, because you had to drive.
Somebody had to be responsible.
Well, I don't know why Loki was saying hey.
He wasn't driving.
I think it had like a Sapporo, a Heineken, and Guinness.
I'm like, let's have the international alcohol today.
So then, of course, just as a reminder.
Oh, yeah.
Orange Lounge was nominated as well.
They didn't make it to the envelope.
Sorry about that.
Well, we reprinted them separately, so they might have.
I had no idea what that excuse was.
And the winner goes to Fluffertracks, Vanevich.
Yay, hooray for the porno radio station.
Hooray for them!
Okay, yeah, great.
So just as a reminder, we didn't win last year, so we'd really appreciate your vote this year.
So head on over to www.orangehoundstrater.com, and it has a link so you can go to the ballot on 9th and 65th and vote!
So I hope you all take a second to do that.
And maybe this year we will be remembered on the envelope.
This year?
We need to make a scene.
They need to realize that it is stations like us who make the money for them.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Planet Earth's down here and you're up here again.
No, seriously.
If it wasn't for us and the fact that people keep wanting to listen to us and we have to pay them more money to enable our listeners to enjoy us.
Do you think that maybe the fact that we somehow actually got nominated Broadcaster of the Year is a little bit of an apology for that last year?
Like, oh shit, we better make it up to them somehow.
They better have a table separated for us.
No, but this is a weird thing.
With rose petals.
And, like, some nice champagne.
And waffles.
Because I like waffles.
I demand waffles!
Waffle!
Here's the crazy thing.
We actually have quite a few listeners in the Bay Area where this show's award ceremony is going to take place.
A lot of people have been asking me if they can go.
We have totally, have got to carry, totally have to make up the choreography for, um, yeah, choreography for, like, something sort of like, you know, the West Side Story, just come in, just start...
Just, like, all just, like, come in and just, like, you know, prance around and shit.
That'd be fucking hilarious.
Actually, we will be taking official sign-ups on our website pretty soon for the official Orange Lounge Radio Entourage.
The folks that will be going with us to the awards show, they have to have 20 bucks, because it costs 20 bucks to go to the show, and you have to have your own way over there or something, because we don't have a big van or anything, so make sure you can find a ride to the hotel where this is going to be at, and I forget where it is.
I'll look it up later in the show and give it to you guys.
Um...
But we do need people to actually be carrying the red carpet so that when Jamie, Loki, and myself arrive, they can roll it out so we can walk on it and walk in.
That is awesome.
And it needs to be crushed velvet.
You think I'm kidding.
The sad thing is, ladies and gentlemen, she's not.
All right.
Anyway, so more to come on that a little later.
So I don't want to keep dragging this segment out.
See, I'm...
No, forget it.
I've said my piece.
You sure?
For now.
Okay.
But I'm going to return to this.
Live 365, now we know you're listening.
Yeah, we know.
You snubbed us last year.
Now that we are really huge international celebrities.
We are bigger this year.
We are bigger than... We have play on DDR Freak Radio.
I'd say we're bigger than the Pope, but that would be in very poor taste this week.
So we're not bigger than that right now.
But we're bigger than... We are bigger than Goatsey.
Yeah, we're bigger than Goatsey.
I agree.
We are bigger than big.
And so you better get out the chapstick because you're going to be kissing our ass so much this year.
Oh my God.
Do you know how many fellow broadcasters are listening to this for the first time going, what a bunch of stuck up bitches.
See if they get our vote.
Jamie really is a polite individual.
If you meet her in person, she's a big fluffy hug monster when you meet her.
I really am cute and adorable, aren't I?
Don't push it.
Seriously, I'm glad we got the nominations this year.
Yes, I'm very glad too.
I was surprised.
I'm not bitter at all about last year.
It's an excuse for me to drink more expensive alcohol.
And have a good time encouraging our fellow broadcasters to
Continue to give the finger to conventional radio.
Exactly.
That's what this is really all about, is giving the finger to conventional radio.
We're about protecting our First Amendment rights and saying, Hey, regular radio, y'all can kiss my ass.
That's right.
We want to be able to say fucking shit on the air, and we're all about our right to say whatever we want.
If we want to tell dick and fart jokes for three hours, that's what we're going to do.
That's practically what we do anyway.
I know.
Anyway.
And we've been doing this for two and a half years.
Moving on.
Let's start off tonight's show, but outside of that little rant, we usually start off the show with a little bit of, how was your week, how was your day?
So let's back up a little bit.
DarkSakura, how was your week, how was your day?
Busy as all get out.
Oh my god.
You know, the week before was spring break.
So now that spring break's over, my ass is back in having to do all this crap for school.
And my teachers have actually taken a bit of mercy on us.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I'm going to be coming up with a few more.
And Lemon Lime Jump, that's cool that your sister's a Marine, my little brother's a Marine too.
So, it's just really been pretty busy.
Oh yeah, I did hang out yesterday with Iguana Girl and Tia.
We went shopping, we did girly stuff all day.
Thank you for watching!
It's just, it's very frustrating right now because I'm in between sizes, so nothing I try on fits worth a damn.
I have a question.
Why is it that pant sizes for, you know, for girls, they're always like, you know, 14, 16, 18.
I'd say they're juniors.
Oh, I never knew that.
So that means I could go to Target.
This is cool.
I can actually shop in the junior section at Target now.
That makes me very happy because I can get stuff cheap now.
And I can go to thrift stores too.
Thrift store shopping is awesome.
I went to a thrift store the other day.
They had a bunch of crap.
I almost bought some vinyl pants, though.
That's awesome.
But they were cut really funny.
And then I went today.
Because of the stupid daylight savings time, my ass was up until 4 o'clock, which I was up until 5.30 on Friday, so it's all good.
And then I went out to lunch with Dan.
We found the motherlode of Atari games.
It was awesome.
Um, in fact, I've got a list here of what we found.
For anyone who is a classic gaming nut like me and my man are, um, we got, uh, the, uh, Star Trek, uh, Starfleet Academy thing that was on the Atari 2600 back in the day.
And, uh,
We also picked up Junior Pac-Man, Frogger 2, and Journey Escape.
Now, I remember the Journey video game in the arcades like back in the 80s.
It was awesome because it actually had like MIDI style Don't Stop Believin' and open arms and stuff that played in the background.
But what is Journey Escape on the Atari?
Was it the same thing?
We haven't even played it in, but it's one of the rarer Atari games.
You need to check it out because I want to know if it's just like the arcade game or if it's like a whole different adventure.
Well, I also was digging around to replace some CDs that I've since lost and
I was off looking for, actually, specifically today I was looking for Blur CDs.
But as I was walking down to the register, this tape caught my eye from the side, and it turned out to be a Gorillaz promo DVD.
Not a DVD, but a VHS.
And Gorillaz is this band you've really been getting into lately, right?
Yes.
Don't give me that look.
Let me warm up my eyes a little bit.
Oh, precious DarkSakura, what is the charm of the gorillas?
No, seriously, what is it?
Because it's like half art, half music, half fandom, which is three halves, but I don't know how it works.
Completely indescribable, just go to the website and you will be lost for hours digging through the studio.
Alright.
I don't have enough time in the show to go into it, so I won't.
Just read my live journal.
Alright, fair enough.
Speaking of LiveJournal, we have an Orange Lounge LiveJournal community.
It's www.livejournal.com slash users slash Orange Lounge.
All one word.
Nice plug.
No problem.
And I haven't really plugged our chat room tonight either, so let me give that a shout out.
www.orangeloungeradio.com.
Click on chat.
Loki, how was your week?
How was your day?
My week's been all over the place.
Oh, let's see.
Starting with Monday.
Monday was kind of eh.
It didn't really do anything.
Tuesday, they finally announced that I got the job at my company.
So now I'm actually game sales now with a nice bonus and nice pay raise.
So that was cool.
And so now I'll be selling games and that kind of stuff.
So that'll be cool.
Then also, let's see what else happened.
Then Wednesday, nothing really much.
Actually, fast forward to about Friday.
Friday went and saw Sin City.
That was awesome.
Then yesterday, I went and got a PSP because I just had to have a PSP to mess around with.
So that was kind of cool.
I got Wipeout Pure and Twisted Metal head on.
And then I hit a car, and that sucked.
That was kind of the down point of the day.
It didn't do any damage to the car, really, I mean, other than some paint scrapes.
I looked at my car, there's a little bit of a bent part on, next to the, uh, headlight, but I mean, it didn't even break the headlight or anything, and the bent part's just like, ever so slightly.
And, I mean, honestly, looking at it, you wouldn't even notice.
Um, and...
So, you know, I had to call my insurance company and deal with all that crap, so that's just sucked.
But, honestly, I don't think anything's going to happen, because, I mean, they've been lowering my insurance, you know, for like the last... I don't even know how many years, and, you know...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But it was kind of fun though today with my PSP because I'm actually researching for the future for our website, PSP Access, special page, IRC, that kind of crap.
So I actually got on, well of course no one in our chat is going to be able to see it because it's in our mod forms, but I got on and actually made a post on Orange Lounge Radio with a PSP.
That's kind of amazing.
Now for those who don't know, the way this has been done is there's actually on Wipeout Pure,
There's a downloadable content link on the actual main menu there.
What's going to happen later on, once they activate it, is you're going to be able to download new maps, new textures, etc.
But that's not available right now.
The big community that buys PSPs, a lot of them are geeks.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
and so basically you can make a web page that has a bunch of links on it and like a browser input thing and you can actually connect to different websites that way and I mean this is being covered on Slashdot and Gadget a bunch of different websites so you can find out more about it on there but the new thing that they just started was PSP IRC and you actually can connect to IRC right now it's only one channel
DarkSakura.com
Now, I've been hearing a lot of folks that are picking up a PSP, what they're actually doing with it is they're using the memory stick to actually put other things onto their PSP, such as pornography, but in more practical senses, their MP3 collections and things of this sort, so they can actually use their PSP as kind of like an iPod replacement, basically.
A lot of people are now saying, F the iPod, because I can pick up a PSP and play MP3s on the go, correct?
Wipeout Wipeout Wipeout
Now, I do, I have been playing Wipeout, and I actually kind of like it now.
But, I don't know, there's a few gripes I have.
First off, I don't have any dead pixels, so that's all good.
Second thing, my background's pink.
And now I realize that all the ones I've seen on the internet have been blue or green.
Well, I read online today...
They change with the months.
They change colors.
So, that's why it's pink.
I couldn't figure it out.
I thought it was special or something, but apparently not.
April is the month of the Cherry Tree Viewing Festival in Japan.
I thought they were just trying to say that, you know, that I got girly PSP.
Anyways, so, yeah, I got that in Twisted Metal Head-On.
Twisted Metal Head-On is exactly like Twisted Metal 2, just a little graphic upgrade.
Now, I like the PSP, the only thing that bugs me is the analog stick.
That thing is so uncomfortable.
It just, it doesn't work for me.
I mean, it would have been nice if they had it above the crosspad.
But, other than that, it's been pretty cool.
I'm actually hoping to get some more games for it later on.
I've also had fun finding open Wi-Fi networks by my house.
Apparently there's some neighbors of ours that don't like to password protect their internet.
So I just jumped, the only problem is I can only jump on it outside because the signal's not that strong.
So I've been browsing the web out on our porch in the cold and rain.
But it's quite fun.
So all you folks out there, be sure to password check your internet or else you're going to have people jumping on with their PSPs.
Now a question I was going to ask you before you were kind of talking about how folks are accessing the PSP networks and everything.
What is the probability, since folks are loading MP3s and videos and stuff, of us, and I know you're kind of looking into this, but I'm kind of curious how far away we are from seeing this,
You know how we do our podcast we do every week where we have the 25 to 30 minute extra show that we do via the podcast.
It's not rehashed material.
It's a whole separate thing.
So if you want to check that out, just go to orangehawnsradio.com, click on to go.
But what is the possibility of folks being able to download that directly onto their PSP?
Do we know yet?
Right now, I haven't been able... I haven't tried downloading anything.
I don't think you can.
Um...
I would imagine it's probably possible you might not be able to download it, maybe view it.
PSP browsing is kind of slow.
I mean, it's actually pretty slow.
That's the only problem.
If you want to get any good speed out of it, you need to disable the... There's a Wi-Fi power save mode on there, and you need to go under your power save options and actually disable that.
It'll browse the internet faster.
But, man, if you stream... If you try to download something, it's going to take forever.
I mean, I don't think you can do it.
Maybe streaming media like our website... Not our website, but our...
Our actual live station they might be able to pick up, but I don't think downloading a podcast would work.
The live station might be kind of difficult too because you have to have that extra hurdle of accessing Live365 and all that.
I don't know.
Hopefully they'll find something because that would be neat to have Orange Lounge on your PSP.
I don't know.
If I had a PSP, I think it's pretty cool.
Maybe we can create a special edition of our podcast that's like a really, really low bitrate or something.
We can think of something.
You know, I haven't tried connecting to Live365.
That might be interesting to try out because it's all Java, I think.
So...
The only thing that really doesn't work on it is frames, and I know if you've visited our website, you've seen how on the side there, there's a little forum, the most recent topics that have been posted, and they kind of scroll up, while on the PSP they scroll left, so it's a little weird.
You know why I don't think Live 365 would work is because the player, when you actually launch the station, and I think most of you guys who are listening to the station probably have this, it actually pops up in a new window.
And I don't think PSP supports pop-ups.
At least I hope it doesn't, or you could get pop-ups from almost any site out there and suddenly you'll have spyware all over your PSP.
But because the player is in a pop-up, I don't know if it's going to be possible.
Now there is the direct access URL you can use, but...
I think you can only use it like, I don't remember, 365's official rules, but I think you can only use it three times and then they make you log in.
It's been a long time since I've looked at the rules on that.
I'm sure there'll be a workaround for it.
Already, here's the other thing that they do have already that you can do that people are doing.
PSP Casting
Thanks for watching!
I actually played some DDR today at home, several different mixes.
I was showing DDR to somebody who had not seen the Xbox mixes yet, so I got to play some Ultramix 2.
I actually worked out, I played some 9s, I was working up a sweat, it was something else.
That's good exercise.
Other than that, you might remember that earlier this week, I don't know if you listened to Thursday Night Show, but on Thursday Night's program we were talking about Yoshi's Touch and Go on the DS, which is a game that I picked up earlier this week because I don't want to spend $300 on a PSP, and I don't want to spend $150 on Night Style just yet, but I want to buy a game to hold me over until I have more money.
So I decided I'd go to GameStop and I was just randomly going to buy myself a new DS game.
Well the problem with the Nintendo DS right now, although the technology is excellent and the DS has a lot of potential, I would say about 1% of the DS potential is actually being used right now.
Because there's what, like 12 games out there for the DS right now?
So there's really not a lot.
So when I said I wanted to buy a DS game, my choices were pretty limited.
So I finally ended up deciding to pick up this game, Yoshi's Touch and Go, which on Thursday Night Show I just slammed because I did not like the game at all.
I thought it was hard to get into.
I thought it was the same, repetitive.
But this is the weird thing.
I still have not been able to put this game down.
And I don't know if it's because it's the only DS game that I haven't worn out yet or what, but...
I've still been playing this game, it's very, very odd.
And I like the fact that you can search for PictoChat rooms, like I've been just, like I was, my friend was driving to the club last night and I was actually playing Yoshi's Touch and Go in the car, searching for PictoChat rooms, trying to see if I could pick up, like, little kids doing PictoChat in the backseat of a car so I could hop on there and go, you know, you suck!
You know, or something, but...
I didn't play it all this week.
You need to help me level.
I do party!
I am a party girl!
Nobody parties like I do, okay?
Alright, sorry.
You gonna party like it's level 99?
What's the damn ferret?
Oh, I just got a ferret thrown at me.
Anyway, um, no, this is mine now.
This is mine, it's in my yard.
It's mine.
Uh, anyway, I guess that's it for my week and my day.
I don't want to drag this out.
So, Angel.
I found my chains of Prometheus, which means I'm back on the game.
Yay.
Okay.
Anyway, so that was like Thursday, I guess.
Tuesday, however, I went to school and went to my class, but only six people showed up, so obviously it got cancelled, and that sucks.
So I'm going to wait until August and take it all over again, but it's all good.
I can wait.
I am patient.
Other than that, I played some DDR this week.
Yay.
Met some people over at the place I usually play at that I hadn't seen in a while, so that was cool.
And not much yesterday.
Went out and met some people from...
Game Called There, I've talked about this many times over, but I actually got to meet the people behind their avatars, so it's cool.
Yeah, I just had a really good weekend, and you know.
and a really good week, so not too much to complain about, not too much to talk about, really.
Pretty boring.
But, hey, at least I can play Final Fantasy XI and a couple other games I've been playing.
Half-Life 2, Koff, Hack, and other stuff.
I guess that's it.
Oh, I got Ultramix 2 this week.
We must play.
What do you think of the DDR Ultramix 2?
I don't know why, but my load time sucks.
Now, I don't know if that's everyone's cartridge or just mine.
I mean, not cartridge, but disc, rather.
I don't know if... You know what I've noticed is that booting up DDR Ultramix 2 takes forever, but once you finally get in there, it's not so bad.
But it's just the boot up takes a long time.
It's like trying to play something on the PSP.
Well, I actually thought it was me because, you know, Andrew was like, why is it taking so long?
What's going on?
It's not supposed to be taking this long.
I'm like, I don't know.
Should we take it back?
He goes, no, no, no.
I'm like, okay.
You know, he's not giving me a straight answer, so I'm like, well, maybe I'll just ask Rob when I get here tomorrow, which I'm doing now, so that's cool.
But I think I do need to get a dual platform pad because the converter I'm using is kind of glitchy.
Yuck.
All righty.
I have a request.
That's happy joy stuff.
What else are we going to have when we come back?
Skyblind, we'll open that up.
So go to www.orangelongeradio.com, click on interact with us if you have something you want to talk about.
We had a request from the chat room to talk about a video game related tour going on this summer.
So we'll talk about that because it's worth mentioning.
And other gaming news when we come back.
So we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
We're going to start it off with a track from Beatmania 2DX11 style.
This is Injection of Love.
Injection of Love.
Thank you for watching!
Thank you.
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Thank you for watching!
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.
Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.
Can we talk about that?
No subject will ever be taboo.
Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.
Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.
Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?
I collect your fucking head.
Just like this fucker here.
Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?
The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!
Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!
Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.
That's right, you guys are going to get a say in this next segment.
We are going to turn on the Skype line very soon.
If you want more information about what the Skype line is all about, www.orangeloungerator.com.
Click on Interact With Us.
In that break, you heard a variety of music there.
Wrapping it up from 11th Style, Don't Be Afraid Myself, before that Wall 5 with EVO 66.
And of course, because Jamie had to hear it, Gradius Full Speed by Mr. T in that break as well.
Starting it off, Injection of Love.
You know, we have a little bit of competition going on tonight with Orange Launch Radio.
Folks are torn between whether they want to listen to Orange Launch Radio or watch WrestleMania.
You know what?
Or watch baseball.
Guilty, guilty, guilty.
Had I had a way to the Bay Area today, I'd be watching WrestleMania.
You know what?
I don't watch wrestling all year anymore, but WrestleMania is like, wow, it's WrestleMania.
Get to see my hot, sweaty men's and their drama.
Men's.
Men's.
You're men's.
What about the women?
There's women wrestlers too, right?
Don't they get into it?
Yeah, but they're all hoochies now.
They used to... WrestleMania 19 was the last one that had women that could actually wrestle.
Uh-huh.
Just because of the one with Trish Shadis.
I just remember Chyna.
Because who doesn't remember Chyna?
Especially when it's the real life and everything.
Yeah, and then she got into TNA and then got her booted from TNA and was all washed up.
I mean, okay, she's really awesome and I think if she got her shit together she'd be all, you know, really cool, but...
Her time's passed unless she can grab it again.
It's just not the same.
We need more Roid Girls.
Speaking of Surreal Life, have you heard about the new season of Surreal Life?
New season of Surreal Life is supposed to have... I mock reality TV.
You know what, though?
But you know you love the Surreal Life.
Come on, didn't you watch the previous one a little bit?
No.
Well, you should.
It had Jaina in it and Mini-Me.
I watched the one where they were branding cattle.
Okay, there you go.
So you watched at least one episode.
So you kind of know what the show's about.
and I did watch one episode before the first episode because I got to see Flava Flav.
Okay, so you watched like season three or two or three, I don't remember what it was.
I watched episodes.
Okay.
I can count them on one hand.
Well, the new season is going to be good because they're going to have Omarosa who now... Oh, I know you're happy.
Wasn't she your hero?
I loved that woman.
She was on The Apprentice and I didn't love her because I actually thought she was cool but I loved to hate her.
No, I don't think... Anyway.
Nope.
Also what I love is Balki from Perfect Strangers is supposed to be on Surreal Life 5.
And that is just so cool to me.
Because what the heck has Balki done since Perfect Strangers?
He's in a B-movie.
I have it.
I'm going to be bringing it home soon, actually.
He needs to do Old Navy commercials now, just like the other washed-up actors.
Well, either you do Old Navy commercials or you join the Surreal Life cast.
What happened to the other guy that was on Perfect Strangers?
They said bring back Perfect Strangers.
That's not a bad idea.
I mean, they're not doing anything.
I mean, no one knows them for anything.
Bring it back.
I mean, it can't be worse than Joey.
Julie, get your butt over here and say hi.
Oh, we have a special guest that just came in the studio.
Get your butt over.
Has Julie ever been on the show before?
She's as webcam shy as I am.
No, Julie hasn't been on the show before.
Well, hi, Julie.
Say hello.
Hi, audience!
This is Julie, also known on DaWeb, the big internet monster as Kasumi19, who never updates her live journal, except once every six months.
They can't hear what you say if you don't talk into the microphone, as you know.
Actually, it's been about nine months.
I'm horrible.
Here's Rob.
PSO addict.
I play some PSO sometimes.
Julie still needs to give me my Opa Opa.
Alright, let's see, moving on.
That was enough pop culture news.
Let's talk about some actual Bomani news going on out there in the scene.
Actually, surprisingly, not a whole heck of a lot, with the exception of some follow-up to the earlier announcement about 2DX Happy Sky.
You know, you hear this?
2DX 12th Style is going to be called Happy Sky.
Happy, happy, happy!
Brain twitch.
I know, I know.
Some very interesting things.
They are just changing things upside down.
Now all this is kind of coming off test location data, so it could be subject to change.
High speed is going to be in there now, but it's going to be in halves as well.
So you can play one speed, two speed.
You could kind of do that before, but now you can have half, 1.5, 2.5.
I think that's kind of cool.
They're supposed to be also hidden plus and sudden plus available in there.
S random mode as well.
With the sudden plus and hidden plus, they're also, they have adjustable hidden sudden areas to where you can pretty much decide where the notes appear or they disappear, etc.
Now here's the other very interesting thing.
Instead of Light, Normal, Another, now it's going to be Normal, Hyper, Another.
And this being probably, I think, some of the biggest news, the ratings are all changing because now Another's are going to be ranked.
So now instead of being like 1 through 8 with flashing 8s, which is the way it is now, for a lot of folks that are on home versions, you might only have seen 1 through 7 with flashing 7s, but in the arcades now it's 1 through 8 with flashing 8s.
Now it's going to be 1 through 12.
About damn time.
One of the reported level 12 songs, V Another, which, you know, if you've ever seen V Another.
Yeah, and I would think that Sakura would be up there.
I don't know.
They're saying right now that that is the only level 12 one.
I think that as far as the DJ Lee Su videos, that was the only one he had to do with using two hands.
It's some scary stuff.
And then some pictures are available if you visit our website, www.orangelandredo.com.
And of course, some of the news, I think we might have touched on this a little bit last week, I don't remember, but there is a crossover artist showing up from DDR Ultramix 2.
Big Idea, who did the song Toe Jam.
Toe Jam is going to be in Happy Sky, which is really weird that a USA artist is crossing over into 2DX.
That's kind of neat, though.
Well, there's good talent all over the world.
There is, there is, but when I think of all the possible DDR songs in history that were created for DDR that should cross over into Beatmania 2DX, Toe Jam isn't really the first one that comes to my mind.
It's not a bad start, just, you know, it could be better.
Well, they've gotten European artists.
I guess that's true.
Some other artists coming back as well, Twin Amadeus, Platonic X, a lot of folks you know.
Ryu, of course, going to be back.
Ryu kind of just started all of a sudden showing up all the time.
Terra, all those folks.
Check that out, that will be...
Location testing currently and hopefully coming to an arcade near you pretty soon.
I guess that's pretty much the biggest Bomani news going on right now.
I can think of some local Bomani news going on.
I want to touch on this, and then we'll open up the skyline.
In Sacramento, two things, jack and shit.
Well, actually, no, there's a pretty big story going on right now.
But it's at an arcade we don't really go to a whole lot, Roseville Golf Land.
Now, understandably, we are an international radio program, so we have folks that listen all over.
But sometimes we talk about our neck of the woods, which is Sacramento.
And we have this arcade here.
It's a beautiful arcade.
It's a two-story arcade.
Huge arcade with a fancy water park.
It's ghetto.
It's ghetto as hell.
Because parents drop their children off there and just leave them there to wreak havoc on the whole place and so they break machines and everything.
Well, here's the great news.
Roseville Golf Land got Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania V. The brand new ones.
I have a reason to go again.
Already the hi-hat is broken.
Okay, why does that crap not surprise me whatsoever?
and the green button on the left guitar is broken as well.
At least some woman didn't try to change her baby's diaper on it like on Little Keyboard Mania.
Probably would have if there was a platform to do so.
So, you know, that's great.
We're all excited because we're getting the new Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania V. And it's very interesting because I was talking to one of our listeners before the show who lives in Vegas.
And they're all excited because they just got 2DX Red and Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania V. And I'm like, yeah, we got it too, except, you know, 2DX Red doesn't work.
It's just a frame without a monitor right now.
And Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania V, both broken.
You know what?
They should let me run Golf Land.
First of all, there would be absolutely none of those retards that piss me off allowed.
Would there actually be a sign on the door that says no retards that piss me off?
Exactly.
And I'll have a list of the people that I've actually had kicked out so that they would know specifically that they are not allowed in.
And then I would have to have some type of scanning device, I think.
Maybe we would be like the, you remember the Studio 54?
Yes, I do.
We would be the Studio 54 of the 21st century.
I like that idea.
Except with no cocaine bar in the back room.
How about a heroin bar?
Can we have that instead?
Okay, we can have heroin, but we have to move to the Netherlands.
All right.
Okay, so I just want to kind of catch you up on that, that we're all excited to have Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania V in town.
And I would give you my full review, however, that shit's broken, so I can't.
So sorry, guys.
Maybe we'll go take some pictures of the broken stuff.
We'll see.
Anyway, we are going to open up the Skype line.
If you guys want to call in and interact with our program, you have something you want to comment on, such as possibly the new 2DX Happy Sky, something that's going on in your neck of the woods.
I know there were a couple DDR tournaments that went on pretty recently.
We'll open up the Skype line.
In fact, we're already getting a call, so let's go to it.
Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
Emerging from the shadows of Bimani style, here's your resident 2DX bastard, DarkLionXVI.
Hey Sky, sit here.
Wow, you've got quite a... I should get a fanfare to play when he introduces... Alright, what's on your mind, buddy?
Well, yeah, I already told you that Vegas has officially gone V and Red.
We have Guitadora V and 2DX Red as of last Thursday.
Yeah, so you were the person I was mentioning a little bit earlier that was telling me about what's going on in Vegas.
Now, did you hear what I was just saying about Roseville Golf Lands got all that too, except none of it works?
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, we're lucky here.
Oh, and about 2DX 12, Happy Sky, I have to mention to you the...
songs that are 12 stars on single oh dude is there more than just be another I only had heard of be another what else is there uh there's a ace double ace
Colors Radio Edit, Time, Genocide, Gigadelic, Innocent Walls, Moonchild, One More Lovely, Please Don't Go, and Piano Kyousokyoku Dai Ichiban Sasoribi, a.k.a.
P.F.
Concerto Artiaris, Sakura, and Setsugekka,
So there are quite a few Anothers.
Okay, that's good.
Good difficulty there for the folks that can actually do that stuff.
More power to ya.
I'm lucky if I can pass an 8, especially considering I haven't played in quite some time.
But I'm really excited about the Anothers actually having rankings now.
Because, you know, I follow 2DX, but I'm not, like, super obsessed.
Like, I don't study note charts.
Like, I have friends that do this, and that's cool.
I don't, you know, that's cool.
That's what they're into.
Um...
But, like, if I'm going to play in Another, I want to instantly be able to know which Another is in my range.
Because you know how, like, Holic was like a 6, but the Another for Holic is freaking insane?
Like, you know, so I want to know about where the Another's stand.
Whereas, like, Dual Control Another, from what I remember, was not that much harder than the original.
So, it's just, you know, I want to know where they stand on the scale.
So that's going to be very helpful to somebody like me.
So I'm excited about that.
And then the singles for 11 stars, it's already listed here on this website.
I got to mention it, the reds are going to be in another.
First, Samurai, Andromeda, Blox, checking you out, click again, Daddy Daddy,
FakeTimeHyper, G2, GigadelicHyper, Judeka, GreenEyes, HalfwayOfPromise, Holic, InnocentWallsHyper, Kechak, Key, LowerWorld, Lucy, LoveToMeUchisEdition, Murmurtwins, Nemesis, Number13, WarnoR8, Quasar, R5, RainbowFlyer, RainbowRainbow, SecretOfLove, SpaceFight, Spyka, SpiralGalaxy, Stoic, TakeItEasy, WonderBullFighter, and Xenon.
And those are all the 11s?
Yeah, the 11s are.
Interesting, wow.
Stoic Another's not a 12, it's an 11?
Well, I guess I could see that, though.
Compared to, like, Moonchild Another, I guess I could see that.
Alright.
So what else is going on besides that 2DX update?
I just sent you a private message about the videos for the location test on the 2DX 12 Happy Sky.
And I'm gonna post it on the chat room.
Yeah, post us a link there in the chatroom at orangezonesradio.com, click on chat.
And for those who are listening, it's at xenon.sub.jp.
Okay, cool.
So post that link in our chatroom and then folks can check out the Happy Sky test location videos.
Can you actually hear any of the music at all in some of this?
It's very clear.
Oh, good.
The first video that I checked out is 100% Minimoog by Sota Fujimori.
Oh, okay, cool.
How's the song sound?
It's really fast.
It's at 252 BPM.
Well, I'll have to check that out a little later.
If it's clear enough, maybe we'll play some on the show a little later.
Really clear.
Very cool.
All right.
Anything else you want to share with us tonight, Siggy?
Well, last thing I want to say is quit calling it bad styles.
You always keep on calling it 11th style.
I know, but it's just... I don't know how to explain it.
It's just... It's the style thing.
It's just, yeah, it's like, you know, 10th style and then it just seems logical the next 2DX because they haven't changed the hardware or anything.
They've only changed... They really haven't changed much than what they changed going from 5th to 6th and 6th to 7th and so on.
So, yeah, I just...
Naturally call it Eleven.
I know it's Red and Happy Sky.
But seriously, do you expect me to call this new 2DX Happy Sky and keep a straight face?
I know you... Everybody can tell you're gonna call it Twelfth Style.
And speaking of Twelfth Style, there is such a song called Twelfth Style.
Huh.
In Happy Sky, there's gonna be a song called Twelfth Style?
Yeah.
That's pretty cool.
So maybe it's okay, then, that I call it Twelfth Style.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Alright, well thank you for the pronunciation update, I appreciate it.
Well, not so much pronunciation, but you know, like referring to, anyway.
I gotta mention the videos on the Sinon subs that they have.
The first one is Captivate Joker, which means Purify.
Second video they have is Get Cool, which is Moonlight.
And then the third one is Green Eyes.
And then the last one is the video that I mentioned is 100% Minimoog.
Okay.
I might have to check that out because I want to hear some of those songs.
I want to hear what they sound like, so I'll definitely be looking at that.
Yeah.
All right.
All right.
Well, thanks for the call, bud.
You have a good one.
Later.
All right, later.
Resident 2DX Bastard Siggy.
We always like hearing from him.
Let's go to another call.
Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
Greetings, it's Ranma South.
Tell me one more time, how are you guys doing?
Good, how are you doing?
Somewhat tired.
I want you to know that I am a devoted fan of the show.
I went to Boston this weekend, and I arranged my trip so I can come back in time to catch the show.
That's hardcore.
Yes, it is.
That's very hardcore.
You didn't have to do that for us.
I mean, heck, if I was going to Boston, I wouldn't have rearranged my trip to come back for this show.
But we adore you for it.
You are awesome and fabulous.
Yes, you are awesome and fabulous.
Well, I do try.
Alright, right on.
What else is on your mind?
What's been going on in your gaming world this week?
Not much.
I've been playing some of my old PS2 games recently.
Right now I'm trying to work through Musashi.
I'm in love with it.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I watched it a bit when it came on TV, but I was so not into Johnny Depp at the time.
It was all River Phoenix.
Okay, alright.
But maybe now you'd have more respect for it?
I don't know.
Not really.
Okay, sorry.
Oh, by the way, guess what?
Ranma?
Yeah, what's up?
I found a doco CD at the used record store today.
First or second?
Actually, it was one of the later ones.
You know, my fianc√©, when I moved in with him, had something like 22 Ranma CDs.
Yeah.
I also found the Fighting Karuta there, too.
I had that, and I lost it.
Well, you know what?
Why don't I set a little time aside in the week?
If it's still there, I will grab you the Fighting Karuta.
Sweet.
I appreciate that.
Because it has the Okonomiyaki song on it.
Awesome.
Wow.
That's really awesome.
Okonomiyaki.
I can't do it anymore.
Okonomiyaki.
You have to cosplay Ucchan one of these days, you got to.
You know, I've been working and working on that, and I keep saying that I'll do it, and I never do.
Half the fun is walking around with a giant spatula.
I cosplayed Baiken once.
Sweet.
I don't think I've seen pictures of that.
There's one on FansView back in the day, and then there was one of me as Mad Hatter for Angel Sanctuary.
Okay, I'm going to have to go digging through that.
I'm going to have to ask Kevin if he can send it to me.
I'll see if I have it somewhere.
It's horrible.
It was like 60 pounds heavier in it.
But you probably still look hot anyway.
That is so sweet.
Oh my, oh my.
Oh, fluster.
Ego fluster.
Yeah, she's already living on another planet tonight.
We don't need to, you know.
Hey, I am a celebrity.
Yeah, exactly, exactly.
You just watch it.
Just for that, I'll eat a bag of M&M's just for you.
Aww.
Alright, any other ass you want to kiss while you're on the line here, Ranma?
I love you, Sky, because you're still a devoted fan of the DS.
I am.
I have faith in the DS.
Well, I appreciate that.
Thank you, Rob.
Not that DS.
Every time somebody says DS, DarkSakura goes, hee hee, that's me.
Well, why wouldn't they think about me?
I know.
But no, it's hard for me to be a fan of the DS right now because we're in a little bit of a slump.
But I am still a fan of the DS.
You know, and I think it's okay for me to say I am a fan of both the DS and the PSP.
There's nothing wrong with that.
I like them both.
I agree.
I'm going to buy a PSP once Sony fixes all the kinks, and I'll wait for a second or third generation unit.
I'm just not a fan of the price of the PSP, but I'll get over it.
I'll get over it eventually.
$250, please.
We couldn't even buy them when they came out.
If it came with Luminous packed in, that would so be worth it.
We'll see.
Yeah.
Alright, well I'm going to let you go.
Have a good one, buddy.
You too.
Enjoy the rest of the week.
Thanks for calling.
Have a good week.
Bye.
Let's see if we can get in one more call at least.
Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
Hey, SSJ100 Matt here.
Hello, SSJ100 Matt.
What's on your mind?
Nothing.
I guess I was going to beat you to the punch.
I was going to talk about the Dear Friends.
Ah, yes, that's right.
You were the one that sent that to me.
Yes, I was going to make a mention of this after the segment, but that's okay.
All right.
What's going on with the Dear Friends?
What's this news you found out about Dear Friends?
Well, I just found out about this earlier this weekend.
It turns out that the Dear Friends Fallen Fantasy concert is coming to the East Coast.
So, and like, we're not talking Chicago, which to some of us in California, Chicago counts as East Coast, but not really to the rest of America.
So, you know, now it's actually going to be in an East Coast state, so some of you guys are going to be able to catch this.
So, you have some of the details you want to tell our listeners?
Um...
They're going to not be in the major cities.
They're going to be in corners of the East Coast.
First one is going to be on May 20th in Hartford, Connecticut.
Right on.
I have friends who live in Connecticut.
They'll be happy about that information.
Yeah.
And in June 24th and the 25th, Atlanta, Georgia is going to have it.
Okay, so some Southeast fun there.
Okay.
And then for some reason they put in San Diego for East Coast touring.
San Diego, North Carolina.
No, it's San Diego, California is getting another show.
So there you go.
So for those of you that maybe missed out on a previous L.A.
show, here's your chance.
You can go to San Diego.
It's up.
That's going to be July 14th.
And then July 23rd and the 24th, they're going to have it in Detroit.
Very cool.
Try not to get shot at that concert, by the way.
Well, I won't go to that one.
I'll go to the Hartford one.
Very cool.
I have friends in Connecticut who would be interested in going.
If I had time off work, I would go, but I won't.
And the money.
And money, yeah, absolutely.
I'm looking forward, though, to the More Friends concert that's going to be happening in L.A.
I do have tickets, so I'm very excited about that.
So we'll see what happens.
But, yep, um, ad here, I'm waiting for In The Groove to finally come I mean, it's been sitting in a DDR4th Mix case for about two months And it's just not working, or?
No, they just have, they have, like, the logo for In The Groove and everything on it And they still just have 4th Mix playing on it Somebody's too lazy to get in there and switch it over
I mean, it's Golfland.
You guys know what I'm talking about.
Ah, okay, okay.
Wait, I didn't know Golfland existed on the East Coast.
No, it's Arizona.
No, I'm from the East Coast, but I'm going to school in Arizona.
Gotcha.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Okay, gotcha.
Huh.
That's kind of... Okay.
So they've got in the groove just sitting there waiting to go.
Okay, well...
In the Groove, you know, for me, there's good things about it and there's bad things about it.
I've said this just about every week.
I find it very interesting what's going on on the Freak right now, over on DDR Freak, about their April Fool's post.
They've turned into these huge In the Groove vs. DDR messes, and I'm just kind of like, can't we all just get along?
You know, there's things to like and things to not like about both games.
Everybody can improve a little bit.
I just, I really don't like that attitude, though, when folks, you know, I guess this is the one thing I will say kind of against in the group, but it's not really the game itself so much as the fan base.
But I really hate it when people come on and go, ah, DDR's dead, time to move on.
Well, okay, didn't they just release a press release in January that said DDR sold a million copies?
Yeah, DDR is like really dead.
Maybe DDR is dead in the arcades, but that's only because, you know, Konami's stupid, for lack of a better term.
But as far as the home releases go, DDR is far from dead.
And I firmly believe that DDR will continue to own In the Groove on the home releases.
But In the Groove is going to pick up the arcade stuff if DDR doesn't do anything, so it's going to be interesting.
No, I'm just anxious to try it.
That's it.
Because everyone's talking about it.
So I'm just wondering if the hype's what it is.
Well, you'll have to let us know what you think once you get a chance to try it out.
Yeah.
Alright.
Yep, I'm watching the Yankee game and listening to you guys.
Alright, sounds good.
Alright, well enjoy the game and I guess we'll talk to you another time.
Alright?
Yep, take it easy.
Alright, have a good one.
Bye-bye.
Watching the game, having a bud.
Sitting back.
Wasabi!
Smoking a bud.
No, I'm kidding.
Alright.
Wasabi!
I watched the sushi restaurant version of the What's Up last night.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
Was that on the internet for download?
When I was at Iguana Girls last night, we were going through some of her old discs, and it was one of the things on there, too, along with Tokyo Breakfast.
And the edited picture of Quasimodo.
Now, that was posted on Iguana Girls Journal earlier, which made me laugh, because... That was an old DDR freak joke.
That was an old-ass joke, yeah.
But funny.
Nobody knows what the hell we're talking about, so forget it.
Let's just move on to... We're going to go ahead and close up the skyline for now.
If you didn't get through, try again later, okay?
What we're going to do now, though, is we're going to move on to the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match!
Woo-hoo!
Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio cage match, we had a champion for two weeks in a row.
Yoko Kanno went into the second week of victory with Rise.
So will she be able to make it three weeks?
We shall find out.
The way the cage match works, for those of you guys who haven't listened before, we do three songs against each other.
Each host picks a song and it does battle.
You guys are the ones that ultimately vote for the winner, so you have to be in our chat room to participate.
www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat.
You only get to hear a clip of last week's winner, because you already heard it last week.
So here it is, a clip of last week's winner, song number one, Yoko Kanno with Rise.
Enjoy.
Thank you for watching!
I'm a little pissed off at how poorly received Kelly Clarkson was last week.
So I've decided...
Screw you guys, I'm putting in Britney Spears.
So here it is, song number two, from me to you with love, Britney Spears with Every Time, the Valentin remix.
I feel so small, I guess I need you, baby I'm running from the deep, moving my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you, baby Baby, baby Baby
You make my dreams, I see your face, your heart is in me, I guess I need you baby I may have made a mistake, please look at me, my weakness caused your pain
And every time I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small
Thank you for watching!
All right, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.
Britney Spears!
Every time, can't wait to hear the votes on this one.
Let's go around, start it off with DarkSakura.
Minus 57, because it's Britney Spears.
I don't know, the music was okay, it was just like, hi, I'm Clicky Cutter Pop.
And it made me feel nauseous.
So much that not even a coconut cream pie would bring back my appetite.
I'm sorry, Rob.
That was... That's alright.
I'm not going to take it personally tonight.
Just awful.
Alright.
Beyond awful.
Alright.
Here, Julie, rate this thing.
Negative 57 from DarkSakura.
Let me go to Loki, then we'll get to Julie.
Loki!
You know, that didn't even really sound like Britney Spears to me.
I don't know, it just didn't sound like it to me.
But I hate her because she ruined my prerogatives, so... Amen!
You know, she gets a minus one.
I'm not going to go as far as 57 because that's just ridiculous.
Alright, Julie!
I go with minus 58.
I just had to be the one giving her the lowest score of all.
Alright.
Because it's just fitting.
Fair enough.
Angel!
No.
Just no.
You ruined my something or other.
God, just, um, negative infinity.
Oh, Loki's going to change his vote.
My vote is going to be 158 plus infinity, so it's an even zero for that song.
Shut up!
Alright, um...
Me, personally, I will be the only one to give it a positive score.
Obviously, I'm the one to put that in there.
I give that song a 7, because, you know, it's not that bad.
It's a dance remix, and like Loki said, it barely sounds like Britney at all.
And you know what?
You guys earned it.
Taint of evil, Rob.
Taint of evil.
You earned it.
And you know what?
It was worth it alone for the chatroom's reaction, honestly.
I should do that more often.
Thank you for the encouragement.
Alright, uh...
Let's get into song number three, Loki!
Okay, um, now this song, I made it for a couple reasons.
One, uh, well, first off, the song I made, okay, um, this is, basically, I found this Max remix on Barmani Style by this guy named DJ Pato, he's like some Spanish guy, and he really sucks at making remixes, and he made this song called Max Extension, which is retarded,
But it had this really cool song in the background in it, and I was like, you know, hey, that'd be a pretty cool song to make a Max remix out of, so that's what I did.
So, adding to my next installment of, you know, the Legend of Trance series, this is also, this was supposed to be because my original thought for the April Fool's joke was going to be Max 300 Radio, and this was going to debut at the end.
Well, that didn't happen, so... Um, and it's... Well, this would... The song would be called Legend of Techno, but that's just retarded, and since I already have, you know, Legend of Trance and Legend of Trance 2004, this is Legend of Trance 2005 with the new synonym Maximum GX, and, you know, the song's remixed from F-Zero TX, so... Enjoy!
Here it is, Loki's putting in... And I know you guys hate Max remixes, but... Livs.
All right, here it is.
Loki is putting in his own creation.
It's a Max remix.
It's Maximum GX with Legend of Trance 2005.
Here it is, song number three.
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Song number three, Legend of Trance, 2005.
Let's see what they thought of it.
DarkSakura.
My head hurts!
Okay.
Um, it was, I'm sorry, it was Max.
It made my head hurt.
I twitched.
But it's not Britney Spears, so it gets a seven.
Alright, Loki.
It's okay.
I, I tried.
I really don't care, just gonna play the song later anyway, so... It gets a 9, because I made it.
Is Julie got a mic?
Can Julie give it a rank there?
Let's... Here comes Julie.
I give that song... Hmm... A 2.
I really wasn't paying much attention though.
I'm sorry.
Alright, that's alright.
Uh, I give it...
Angel
By the way, I'd like to give the whole, um, Initial D soundtrack a big fat zero because your beat sucks ass!
Now, now.
Now, now.
Don't get angry just because you entered a Max Remix.
Angel!
Good beats and stuff in there, but it's Max, and I'm not... I don't know.
I just... I can't deal with regular Max or whatever, so... I'll be nice and give it a 7.
You know, if you wanted to make a good mix, you could do, like, Legend of Butt or something.
I love the fact that three of us said, it's a good remix, but it's Max.
You know, you people...
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, Drew, Carameldansen
I have no doubt you made a better remix than this other guy, but I want Max... I want... You know what?
You know what we should do?
I want to get DJ Paranoia on the show, and I think we could arrange it.
And I want him to say on air that they will ban Max remixes from the Stepmania catalog.
I don't know what we have to do to him to get him to do that, but I think we need that to happen.
Do you think that's possible?
That if the name Max is in the title of the song, it's banned.
We have to curse him.
We'll have to do something.
I'm going to see if I can get a hold of him.
I don't know what we have to bribe him with, but I want it done.
Ice cream!
Ice cream is a winner.
We can send him lots of ice cream.
Lots of ice cream.
It means my song will still be on there because it's named Legend of Trance.
There's no Max in the title at all.
We'll send Girl Scout cookies to Boaz.
I'm seriously going to get in touch with him.
We'll see.
We'll send him Girl Scouts to service him.
All right, let's recap the songs you can vote for tonight.
Song number one, Yoko Kono.
Sorry, I almost said like Yoko Ono.
Yoko Kono.
Yoko Kono with Rise.
Song number two, Britney Spears, Every Time, the Valentin remix.
And song number three you can vote for tonight is Maximum GX with The Legend of Trance, 2005.
Maximum GX
Place vote now!
Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote for song number one, song number two, or song number three.
So, um, send a private message.
Remember, if you post your, um, vote publicly in the chat room, that's great.
You'll be trying to swear, uh, swear, swear,
Sway other people to vote the way you would.
However, it doesn't count unless I get it in private message.
So if you're not sure how to send a private message, just ask nicely and somebody in the chatroom will fill you in.
That's why we have a whole little op team.
Your ops will help you out.
Alright, this is usually the part of the show where I ask Loki what the hell's going on in the sim scene besides unnecessary Max remixes.
But I know there's quite a bit going on this week.
There's some very colorful things going on.
So what's up?
Well, first off, I'd like to mention there's a comment thing under DJ Pato's new remix, which is Max Life Superior Cancer Mix.
I don't know what the fuck that is, but I love his comment.
This is the best, like, comment right here.
It says, Alex Calderia and Badass, they must meet to eat shit.
I don't know what that means, but the whole quote, they must meet to eat shit, is funny.
I don't know.
But anyways, um...
I digress.
No, but April Fool's Day.
You're only a fool if you didn't download these packs because there are so many being released it's not even funny.
We have the release of D3 Mix 2, which is just another DDR, like, you know, food mix type thing.
Nice little 186 meg file there.
We had LFT Mix 2.
All of these are just like Food Mix.
Strawberry Steps actually has the videos just like Food Mix.
All really good stuff to download to at least play while you're waiting for Food Mix 2 to come out.
So, check those out.
If you're looking for links, there's a whole thread on Bomani Style under the
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
A lot better than ours, like most everything else.
So that's what's going on.
Oh, and DDRUK, I mentioned they were coming up April 1st.
There was an April Fool's joke, sort of.
They're coming up.
They're actually launching Monday.
So look for DDRUK to come in back.
Wasn't their April Fool's joke something about, oh, Konami supports us now, like any of us would believe that?
No, their actual April Fool's joke was they were going to be Dancing Stage Fusion UK or something like that.
It was for a little bit.
It was really stupid.
So that was up there.
But as far as I'm aware, they didn't do an April Fool's thing.
Probably because last year was kind of retarded, but I don't know.
So yeah, DDRUK is coming up tomorrow, supposedly.
Well, at least their joke wasn't something really stupid like getting bought by another media corporation or something.
That would just be stupid.
So at least it was Konami.
Yeah, that would suck.
So, yeah, nothing really going on in the sim scene other than, you know, more Max remixes that suck.
But, you know, I've got to put a new one out every now and then just because, you know, I... I don't know.
I've been trying to make some other stuff, but, you know, this song... Usually, when I make stuff, it's usually to make something that's better than someone else's stuff, so... Blame it on them.
If they wouldn't put the stupid sim files out, I wouldn't get inspiration to make another Max remix.
It's all their fault.
I'm going to write him an email as soon as this show's over and say, we want to interview you, we want to talk to you about a very serious issue facing the Mimani community and then spring it that we want to ban Max Remixes.
And we need his help because that site only perpetuates, encourages people to make Max Remixes.
What about Paranoia remixes?
You know what?
I haven't had my limit of that yet, although I'm getting very close.
You know, in a perfect world, we would ban Max remixes, Paranoia remixes, and there's another one.
Huh?
Drop?
No, not Dropout.
There's another one that needs to be stopped.
Sakura?
Sakura.
Well, Sakura's kind of another version of Max 300, though.
But Sakura is awesome.
The original?
Yes.
But not remixes.
I haven't really heard too many remixes, but nothing could... You know, I can't really consider Sakura a version of Max 300 just because it's so awesome on its own, but... Only because it shares an entire bass line for Max 300?
But it has the other... that makes it instantly cool.
Ah, whatever.
They're gonna make Banjo 300 or something like that, and they'll just have a banjo over the... That would be awesome!
Banjo 300!
I thought of it.
Bag.
Now, you don't hear a whole lot of bag remixes, but people that try to remix it try to be funny.
Usually it's like Bag Survivor.
Anything with Survivor in the title.
That's it.
Anything with Survivor.
Unless it's the Destiny's Child song.
And even then, I think somebody already did it, so we don't need any more.
So, that's it.
Unless maybe you're going to do Eye of the Tiger.
I don't know if anybody's done that.
That might be okay.
But I want all cowgirl Survivor.
TheSevenJump, Survivor, LetThemMove, Survivor, I want that shit stopped.
Let me just point out, and to further...
Rob's argument about bad Max remixes.
Let me just read to you the latest Max remixes that are being released right now.
We have Max Borg Assimilation, Max Life Superior Cancer Mix, The Legend of Max OTLK Version, Max Unlimited, Sakura Max Unlimited 300, Max Fantasia Version 3, meaning there's been two more before that.
Max 300, The Wacko Reflex Remix, Paranoid Survivor Max, Max Energy High Voltage Remix,
Unlimited Legends of Max Version 2, Max Extension, 2 Max 330 And that, now I'm going to cut you off right there because that is just in the past week.
That's just in the past week.
Fucking stop, people.
Seriously.
And then like you go into the week before, Love Love Shine Survivor Max.
Yeah, just what we needed.
Ass.
We'll get to the cage match winner in a little bit, but first we're going to go to a quickie break.
And in this break, Max remixes!
No, just kidding.
We're going to do, I don't know, I want to do a song that really doesn't suck.
What's a song like that just doesn't suck?
From what?
How about the original Sakura?
We can do the original.
Yeah, play Sakura.
Alright, we'll do that.
Even though it's kind of Max, but you're right, it's got the extra something something that makes it a little better.
We'll do Zenon.
I like that.
Okay, I'm liking these ideas.
So, we will be back after this.
I'm having trouble locating the Sakura file.
I know I have it somewhere.
Don't forget you can visit our website.
We have the webcam over at www.orangeonline.com.
Of course, there's not a whole lot interesting on webcam tonight because we don't have quite a full studio as we sometimes do.
But you'll catch one of us dancing in front of it once in a while, so it's definitely worth checking out.
Also, the chat room, of course.
Alright, we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio and we got the FUs of the week coming up at some point and we might have to do some kind of game tonight.
We'll have to do some type of game or something as well.
So we'll be back after this.
Thanks for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thank you for watching!
From the Step Squad to Orange Lab, this PDR sucks!
Holla!
P-T-P-O
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
In that break, you heard a little bit of Sakura, followed by Zenon, R3, and Innocent Walls, both by request from the chat.
Actually, the chat just said, play something Taku, so I picked one we hadn't played in a while.
Taku makes me all flush.
Or as you said in the chat room, Taku is sex.
Yes.
Which is funny because then someone said, you know what, Jamie, you always come in here and you just say something is sex, and then you leave.
I am not obsessed.
No, you're not necessarily saying taco sex, but you go in there and you'll be like, gorillas are sex.
Or, you know, like, Orange Sounds Radio is sex.
Or, you know, Splenda is sex.
I don't know what... Splenda is sweet.
Splenda is sweet.
But, you know, you'll go in there, oh my god, that's sex.
You know, it's like me and that's hot.
Like, you know... That hot.
That's hot.
We need to tell them the story of that hot.
The story of That Hot, there was a gentleman on Phantasy Star Online, well, I'm saying that nicely about him, who would always, he kept trying to say That's Hot, and he's not originally an English speaker, and it was very obvious, so he would refer to everything as That Hot.
And the phrase just kept carrying on and carrying on.
He's a very unique individual.
His name is Guan Li, and he lives somewhere in Minnesota.
I don't know exactly where, but I know he's in Minnesota.
Minnesota.
Alrighty, back to... Okay, that hot, that hot.
That's awesome.
I might have to start saying that, that hot, ouch, that... Or somebody in the chatroom said, ouch, that hot.
That's great.
Okay, let's find out who won tonight's cage match.
You ready to find out who won the cage match, boys and girls?
I don't care who won.
I'm fabulous.
Okay, now tell me.
Well, here it is.
The winner of tonight's cage match.
Three weeks in a row.
Woohoo!
Yoko Kanno with Rise.
You know what that means, boys and girls.
Next week, Yoko Kanno is going for retirement.
That'll only be, if it gets retired next week, it'll be the third track in Orange Lounge history to get retired.
Behind Echo Image with Comeback and Gwen Stefani with What You Waitin' For.
Yoko Kanno is awesome.
How Gwen Stefani made it four weeks with a bunch of top 40 haters, I will never understand, but it really did.
People had no taste and voted for the sellout.
Alright, so there it is, Yoko Kanno with Rise.
Next week is the retirement week, so Loki, you and I are going to have to bring out the big guns.
Oh, man, I have to bring girls back.
Oh, wait, that sounds like big guns.
Dear God, no.
Great, so it's all going to come down to me, apparently.
I will have to find the perfect song.
I know something that they'll vote for every time, so I'll bring it.
I'm like, what echo image do I have that we haven't put in yet?
Let's see.
AYUMI HOMOSAKI
EZ Breezy
You know what?
What?
I need to send you one of her and... Shoot, who was it?
It's some rapper chick.
It was off of the Rush Hour 2 soundtrack.
Blow My Whistle.
Uh, uh, blow my whistle, I don't know who did that.
It's like one of her... Missy Elliot or something, or, I don't know.
No, I don't think so, but it was one of her first English ones.
Oh, okay, oh, it's a Japanese.
I'm sorry.
I thought you just said it.
Yeah, it's Itada Hikaru.
Oh!
Oh, I didn't know it was her.
Yeah, I'll find it.
It's one of her early all-English ones.
Oh, I'll have to find it.
Alright.
Um...
Moving on, I thought we could get into the DDR Freak Post of the Week.
We appreciate your loyalty.
You can catch it the week after on DDR Freak.
When I say the week after, I mean this Friday's show will actually be last Sunday's show.
It's kind of like a week gap.
I don't know why it is that way, but it just is.
I think that's to give us a little bit of a buffer should we miss a week or something.
It's to save our butt a little bit, so we'll see.
Anyway, let's get into the DDR Freak post of the week.
I have a tie for the DDR Freak Post of the Week this week, because there's two really, really good ones.
So we're going to start off with this one.
It's a thread, and it was created in DDR Chit Chat, which is the home of great DDR Freak Posts of the Week.
We love our spam.
This post was by a BASIC member, and the subject is New Religion, Anti-DDR Forever.
And the post reads, join my friends, new religion, anti-DDR forever.
It's Christian based, but it says that DDR is a sin.
He has added an extra commandment, no DDR.
By the way, commandment was spelled without a D. So he added an extra commandment, no DDR.
That's the post.
It's Christian-based!
But they've added an extra commandment.
They should meet... Rob, that earns a yay.
He's a demo bass.
He's a demo mouse.
No, but this is the funny thing.
This is what makes the post more hilarious than anything.
Is the signature says... This is the guy's signature.
I'm single and it sucks.
I wonder why!
Who didn't think that?
Like, seriously, I would like to know, was there anybody in the chatroom when I said, I'm single and it sucks, is this guy's signature?
Is there anybody in the chatroom, anybody out there listening that didn't think, I wonder why?
I have to know.
Probably the third post down.
Uh, the third post down, oh yes.
Four is amazing.
Somebody above it said, WTF, you're either a complete idiot or just a terrible troll.
I'm guessing the latter.
And then the next person said, I'm guessing both.
And then this is great.
Somebody else jumps in there and says, Ah, and using the Lord's name in vain like you did in one of your other posts is not a sin?
Oh, snap.
Somebody totally served that guy.
I need this thread, though, because I have to look at something on it.
Actually, it was locked.
I...
Oh, okay.
Do you want me to link the whole chatroom to that, or just you?
Yeah, link the chatroom to that.
There you go.
Have fun with that, you guys, although the post is locked.
You can't follow up on that anymore.
Alright.
Let's see.
One other post, because one DDR Freak post of the week is just not enough.
There were too many good posts this week, so we have another one here.
Um...
and it's actually not a brand new topic but it was posted in an existing thread and it's in the red octane ignition version 2.0 thread and this is post number 182 and this is what's great is that you get to see what happens when DDR Freak filters take over here's the post
Looks like after Frick two weeks of use, this pad is already starting to give out.
Here come the Frick random goods on 7-footers.
Frick worthless piece of $100 garbage poopy buttocks Frick.
After a frustrating B-score on A-heavy, I threw the Frick pad on the floor and punched the living Frick out of it, and then I grabbed the cord and smacked it on across my wall, breaking the Xbox piece off.
Frick, piece of garbage poopy, don't Frick buy this red-ock tank and Frick suck my penis, then vomit and eat that too.
I love the filters.
I really do love the filters on DDR Freak.
That, you know, that makes the whole post right there.
Don't frick buy this red octane, can frick suck my penis and vomit and eat that too.
It's like a really bad version of DDR Mad Libs or something.
Oh man, go the filters, that's funny.
I don't stand for censorship in the chat room.
All right.
If you have a suggestion for DDR Freak Post of the Week, you can always send me a private message on DDR Freak.
My name is Sky, S-K-I-E.
And actually, some folks have done that.
We actually had, I think last week or two weeks ago, was a user-submitted Post of the Week.
So send those over.
But please remember...
If you see mental retardation going on on DDR Freak, and it's not somebody who is actually mentally retarded, because that would be okay.
That's okay if somebody actually is mentally retarded.
But if somebody is acting mentally retarded, you need to PM a moderator so they can lock the thread.
Yes.
Look, you know one.
Hi.
Send me a private message.
I'll make sure you're taken care of.
Oh, I'm sorry.
They wanted a link to that post as well with the Frick Eat My Vomit 2 one.
I'll find it, guys.
I'll post it in chat.
Oh, I found it.
There it is.
Remember, guys, it's post 182 in the thread.
It's a very large thread.
So have fun with that.
All right.
You know, there is a way you can get around those filters if you're smart.
Yeah, but we're not going to tell you.
Yeah, I'm not going to tell you, but it's not that hard to figure out, just, you know.
You just have to be bold about doing it, that's all.
Wah, wah, wah!
Alright, anyway.
What, it wasn't funny when I read it?
No, but it made me laugh again the second time.
Because of all the caps and stuff, like it goes from caps to lower the caps, it's just funny.
and I quote, Poopy Buttocks Frick.
Alright.
Let's see, what else are we going to get into here news-wise?
I thought there was some other news that needed some talking about here this week.
There's something going on.
You know, we've got our podcast that goes on, and you can download that from our website, www.orangelandtrader.com, and click on To Go, and that's where you can figure out what's going on with the rest of the gaming world.
We've kind of started to expand to talk a little bit more about the general gaming world here on this program, but, you know, we talk a lot about other stuff on the other program.
You know, somebody was asking in the chat room earlier, what happened with DDR featuring Mario?
And that was a good question because we haven't heard a whole lot about DDR featuring Mario lately.
So I kind of decided, hey, as long as I'm on DDR Freak making fun of people, maybe I'll go and actually get a useful thread.
And...
I went to check out what's going on on the DDR GameCube thread, and there's really not a whole lot going on right now.
Apparently there might be screenshots in GMR magazine, but there's nothing really super official that has been announced yet.
And then rumor is that screenshots for the pad have come out recently, but nothing super duper official that we haven't already seen as of yet.
That answers the DDR Featuring Mario question as well.
I guess what we're going to do now is we're going to go ahead and get a little bit angsty.
So if you guys want to go ahead and submit some FUs of the week to my private inbox there in the chatroom, just send me a private message, we will start to get angsty with a little segment we call the FUs of the week.
And Jamie, why is it that we have to do the FUs of the week every single freaking week?
Because the world sucks!
This world is bullshit!
Oh, this is bad.
Here is justice.
Here is punishment.
Here is... This is fucked up!
I F you to my busy, busy, busy, busy, busy... Did I say busy?
Schedule.
Okay?
I work all the damn time.
I go to the gym, I go to school, and then by the time I get home, I'm too damn tired to do anything else.
Except work on, you know, whatever projects I happen to have going on.
Big F you to putting a lot of hard work into something and then not having it recognized.
And that's happened several times over the past week, so I've been kind of, eh.
F you to my driver's side window for randomly becoming detached from the mechanism that holds it up and rolling itself down.
Creating a loud whistling noise not unlike that heard in a hurricane.
Really aggravating.
When I'm trying to listen to my good music really, really loud in my little, you know, 93 Tercel, my speakers are bad enough as it is.
F you to the person who was going 10 miles under the speed limit when I'm trying to go 20 over.
I hope that no CHP people are listening to that.
And a big F you to myself for not being able to decide on what my next hair color should be.
Maybe I should leave that to the chat room.
Find me a haircut and find me a hair color because I'm getting damn tired of what I have now.
And a big F you toward...
Having people not recognize how much of a fabulous celebrity I am.
I'm done.
Thanks.
Loki, it's all you.
Okay, first off, fuck you to goddamn me hitting a car.
That fucking sucked.
And you know, that just totally put a big, huge roadblock in my perfect weekend.
So, fuck you to that.
Also, fuck the fact that Mitch Hedberg had to die because he was touring with Stephen Lynch and that would have been an awesome show to see.
Now I just have to settle for Stephen Lynch.
Oh well.
And fuck you to the Pope for not dying fast enough for me to make a joke about him on April Fool's Day.
God damn it, you know, he was just clinging to life and he just needed to die.
Just die quick.
We knew he was going.
They already read him his last rites.
It was kind of like, okay, yep, we're just waiting for him to stop breathing.
Okay.
I mean, they weren't even trying.
He was just like, you know, dying.
So, to hell with him.
And, um...
Also, um, I know I had some other ones.
Oh, once again, fuck you to me for hitting that car, um, only because the car was an SUV being driven by women.
And you know how I say women drivers, women who drive SUVs fucking suck.
There's a big, you know, bit of irony for me, so, um, oh well.
I, I live, last accident I've been in was like seven years ago anyway, so, and this is like, not even, doesn't even really even qualify as an accident, so it's,
All things just keep getting better
Uh, F you to the fact that there's been so much death in the media lately, like between that chicken Florida and the Pope.
I'm sick of hearing about people dying.
Let's hear about something happy once in a while.
I want to hear about Disneyland getting a new ride or something.
So, just, God, find something happy to report on once in a while, you guys.
Dang.
Um...
An F you to PSPs for costing so much money.
An F you to work drama I had on Friday.
Nothing terrible.
I was an angsty little man on Friday.
And I didn't participate in April Fool's Day as much as I wanted to because of things that were going on on Friday.
I hate it when things put me in a bad mood like that.
and then F you to the fact that I think my car needs repairs because I don't like having to pay for that stuff.
I'm sorry.
That's alright, it's not your fault.
Unless you were the one that broke my car, then it is your fault.
No, I didn't.
Alright, that's good.
And then also F you, lastly, F you to the House of Wax for having Paris Hilton in it.
That's not hot.
Hey, what if she dies?
You know what, and that's what I was saying, since she doesn't have top billing, she's likely to be an extra character that gets offed in the movie, so that would be worth seeing.
And notice in the trailer, the first thing that they show her is making a sex tape.
Oh, but I'm sure that's supposed to be funny!
Nope, sorry.
Comedy.
Let's go to the rest of the room here and get their FUs, starting off with DDR Angel, and then over to Julie.
I've been to myself not finding the change of Kalathia disc sooner because, uh, yeah, I, I, uh, inadvertently jinxed Sky over here to, uh...
Let Me Borrow His, but then he couldn't find his either, so that was kind of weird.
Um, yeah, so I found him, whatever.
Um, I viewed that class getting canceled on Tuesday because I really wanted that one to work out, but hey, I guess rules are rules, and I showed up, but nobody else did, so that's kind of sad.
And, let's see.
F you to the stupid person who on the way here tried to cut me off and made me go all the way around.
FU to my schedule, I agree with that.
And FU, I agree with all the people dying.
There was a poke out on the anniversary of my cat's death, which was kind of interesting.
And, by the way, at Disneyland, there is something happy going on on May 5th.
They're doing their big anniversary celebration.
That needs to be in the news.
I'm sick of all the death, too.
There we go.
See, I want to hear about happy children partying at Disneyland.
And then getting blown away with bombs.
No, I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.
I'm not that sadistic.
All righty, and I guess that's the end of my FU for today.
All right.
I do like what the chat room is saying, though.
They're suggesting that there be a Kingdom Hearts ride added at Disneyland.
That would be hot.
That hot.
That hot.
That hot.
Great, you can tell Guan that he's infected Orange Lounge Radio now.
I will let Guan know.
We're going to get a shirt with all our new catchphrases that we have invented.
DaMubAss, ThatHot, what else do we have?
Deathcake.
Deathcake.
We'll see.
You will have tea and cake with the vicar or you will die!
The new one.
They need to meet and eat poop.
Or eat shit.
The one that was from DJ Pato's thing.
I still go with Poopy Buttocks Frick Frick Poopy Eat My Penis and Vomit 2 or whatever the hell that said You know what our shirt should be?
It should just be a bunch of DDR Freak posts No, we just need the shirt that says OLR That Hot OLR That Hot That would be just fabulous I like that idea, we'll have to see Anyway, let's get to the chatroom FUs, shall we?
Thank you, Captain Jack, who's going to be walking us through the chatroom FUs.
I don't think you can pronounce this all one word, and if I... Is this... I don't know.
Lxldubes, we'll say that.
Lxldubes.
Lixldubes?
I don't know.
Lxldubes says, I need to send an FU to Resident Evil 4 for making me kill Spanish-speaking monsters.
What's next?
Lawn-mowing aliens?
Illusion says, F you to myself for falling asleep before Robot Chicken last week and TorrentBox for not having the file up for me to download.
Fuck the cunt of Russia.
Oh, and here's me plugging www.cynictaxi.co.nr.
Cynical articles and general wackiness.
Just search for Robot Chicken Torrents.
It's not on TorrentBox, but I found it, so it's out there.
DJ Tyrant says, F you to having to play Levin in the first round of RGC F you to school, F you to the in the group screen at Electric Avenue
John Field says, F you to running out of space again in my computer.
I can't believe it.
I'm at 773.17 gigabytes and I've used almost all of it up again.
I just bought that 400 gig hard drive in January.
I really need cheap terabyte drives.
Also, F you to this stupid RAID card that crashes my computer randomly and unrecoverably.
F you to turning my room into the pigsty that it is now.
F you to not enough hours in the week.
Oh, and F you to daylight savings time.
Why does this exist?
Thank you.
Oh, my God.
I completely forgot.
A giant F you to daylight savings time.
Because of daylight savings time, I didn't get to bed until 6 in the morning today.
That's bad.
I mean, five in the morning is pretty bad.
Six in the morning, really bad.
So, you know, just F you to daylight savings time.
I hate you.
Please die.
Why do we have daylight savings time?
Somebody told me it's a farmer's thing.
That they did it so that farmers could get up at a reasonable hour and tend to the crops.
You know what?
Julie?
Yeah, it was due because there was some votes and actually there's some areas in the United States that don't actually observe it.
It's because they were mad that parents were having their kids walk to school while it was dark.
The farm thing I'm not doubting is true as well.
Get the kid a flashlight.
I agree.
Get the kid a gun.
I totally agree with that.
I dig daylight savings time, though, because then I get to drive to work in the dark again.
It weirds me out.
Because I get to drive to work at 6 a.m.
in the morning.
Who lets their kids walk to school anyways?
Honestly, I mean, buses pick up any kids that are, like, one mile, you know, further away, I mean.
Who gives a shit?
Most people don't walk anyways, and the people that do walk, oh no.
Yeah, because you know all those muggers out there that want to steal their kids' lunch money.
Woo!
Seriously, and in this part of town where I'm from, like, you know, all the 16-year-olds have SUVs anyway, and they're all driving to school, so, whatever.
Anyway, sorry.
Let's get back to the FUs.
Ranma says, fuck you to the city of Boston for not having beer.
ARG, we had to travel out in the suburbs for it, and the liquor stores close at 9.
Fuck this nonsensical Puritan bullshit.
Fuck Boston.
Oh yeah, fuck Red Sox, go Yanks.
Oh god, he's gonna start that on this show.
SSJ100Matt says, F you to DVD Studio Pro.
The programs keep crashing in my class, thus taking forever to finish my final project.
F you to me for taking forever to get out of the 7 and 8 step range in DDR.
3 to 5 months and counting.
FU to the Farley Brothers and Jimmy Fallon for making the Boston Red Sox movie.
Ninst says, FU to the place I ordered my PS2 flip-top from.
It's two weeks late and I can't get a hold of anyone from the company.
I want to play 2DX already.
Enjoy the disputed charge.
FU two of the guys I work with.
They are complete idiots and they never shut the hell up.
FU to Snow in April.
Dark Knight says, my FU goes to the screw up my job did when I got paid this weekend instead of taking 40 bucks out of my check to help me pay my taxes off from 01.
They took the whole amount that I owe, which leaves me with nothing for two whole weeks.
An FU to employees who don't know when to keep their hands to themselves, especially when they try to steal from the store.
Genius.
RPGKing7 says, my two FUs of the week are FU to not being able to get some alone time with my girlfriend and FU to missing my best friend of seven years who left for the Canadian Navy.
Oh, and fuck you to the end of the Beck Mongolian Chop Squad anime.
It should go on forever.
And lastly, Flerone, FU to Dizzy from Guilty Gear XX not having an insta-kill.
Boss I know with heal without an insta-kill?
No thanks.
That's it.
The end.
Thank you for playing the FUs of the Week.
We'll have something fun to talk about.
We need more of your karaoke revolution skills.
Oh, come on, be our diva.
By the way, I've got to bring that to work, actually, karaoke revolution and DDR, because apparently the blockbuster, and they don't do this blockbuster sort of...
I don't really want to say the convention, like sales conference type thing that's in Texas.
And they're bringing DDR and Kuroki Revolution to play.
So they want to try it out here to see what it is.
So I got to bring it in.
Yay me.
All right, we'll be back after this break.
And just so you guys know, I ain't screwing with you.
I'm starting off this break with some erotic.
So we better start seeing some good questions for Ask Orange Lounge.
We'll be back after this.
You hear the priest that's trying to keep this god asleep Love's shining eternally, love will make you feel so free Come on girl, it's okay for satisfaction You must break the flame of passion In the blood that's shining in the temple of love
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Come on, come on, do the locomotion with me.
Locomotion, come on, you got the notion.
Locomotion, do it back, yeah.
Everybody's doing a brand new dance now.
Come on, baby, do the locomotion.
I know you'll get to like it if you give it a try.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.
And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.
Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free
Let's get into some Ask Orange Lounge.
We've got some time to fill here tonight, so we're going to get into this.
And then we might try to do a little bit of news, too, if we kind of run out of questions.
But it looks like a lot of you guys have some questions you've got to know the answer to.
So we'll get into that.
Let's Ask Orange Lounge, Some Stupid Question, What Will We Find Out This Week?
On Orange Lounge Radio, you can tell that we need to fill a little time, 30 minutes to be exact.
So I hope this segment is long tonight.
It's a slow news week, what can we say?
Illusion says question.
Here is a question for Sky.
Oh God, I should have known this subject would come up tonight.
How could you not absolutely love Sin City with a passion?
He's referencing a live journal post I made earlier this week that said simply, Sin City, all style, little substance.
First, to give the point tonight, we'll do a little point counterpoint.
I will let Loki gush about Sin City.
Um.
Since it was awesome, I mean, first of all, it's very, um, stylistic.
It did have substance, it had much substance, very, very much substance.
Anyways, um, it was basically the best adaptation of a comic book that's ever been made.
They actually didn't even make a screenplay for it, it was done straight from the comic book.
Um, I loved it, actually, um...
My favorite parts were those of, I believe it was, the big fat kill was pretty good.
I liked that with all the whores with guns.
Gotta love that.
I especially loved, I believe her name was Miho or something like that.
She was badass.
I mean, that's something that Jamie would like because, I mean, totally Battle Royale-ish.
It's very awesome.
You would just be like, this chick kicks ass.
Okay.
I would recommend Jamie.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Frodo eating the other hobbits
Frodo plus Harry Potter equals scare, seriously, because you look like Harry Potter.
Yeah, Harry Potter and Spider-Man crossed.
And, you know, throw in a little bit of cannibalism.
That would pretty much what you'd have Elijah Wood's character.
And then, Bruce Willis stuff is pretty good, too.
It's ultra-violent, very gruesome.
There were people actually walking out because they didn't realize how gruesome it was.
They saw people that were retarded, because you're always going to get the retarded people coming in.
They're bringing their kids to see this movie.
Why do you bring your kids to see this movie?
It's a rated R movie.
It's not meant for kids.
Why do you bring your kids?
Because they're stupid and don't read up on stuff to begin with.
And then later on you're going to say, Well, I think it's all about Sin City, so that's why they ripped off Mommy's arm.
And now I'm suing, you know, Miramax.
Fuck them.
It's the world of people who can't think for themselves.
All right, my turn.
I did not dislike Sin City, so I don't want to be labeled as a Sin City hater, because I did enjoy the movie, but I also do not believe that this... Like, I have seen at least three different people declare this the best movie ever made, and I definitely don't think it's the best movie ever made.
I think I'll see a better movie this year.
But it's a good movie still.
I don't really want to see it again, but I thought it was a good movie and I just recommended it to Jamie.
So, you know, I don't have bad things to say about the movie, but here were my issue with it.
It was very stylistic.
Like, it looked so sexy.
The look was so great.
The acting really ruined some of it for me.
Because you had some people that were acting one way, like kind of that, I don't know, that element of the 30s, you know, noir style.
And then some folks that just...
And I would put probably Brittany Murphy in that category.
And the chick that played...
Goldie or whatever, and the other, I don't know, there's that Goldie chick, and then, it's basically most of the women, except for the one who played like the queen whore, like she was like queen of the whores, she was badass, okay, she was pretty cool, but a lot of the acting just kind of didn't do it for me, so, that was just me.
and you know I just thought it went on like really really really long and I kinda would have thought a comic book movie would have been a little more fast-paced like there were some scenes in the movie that were very fast-paced and I was like when it was like really fast-paced I enjoyed it but a lot of it was just very like but don't get me wrong I didn't think it was bad I just didn't think it was like the oh my god greatest thing ever anyway um let's see more questions we do have more questions
You can still ask questions if you want, you guys.
Let's see.
Dark Knight wanted to follow up to something he was saying in his FU earlier.
He said something about an employee stealing from the store.
Someone got caught last night, ended up only being two cashiers that night, and I had to work in women's, so not fun.
And he's asking, so are we having a slow cam night?
Yeah, we are having a slow cam night.
Sorry, guys.
That's because our special guest is hiding from the cam.
She's stealing my shtick.
I'm supposed to be the mysterious co-host.
Here's the interesting thing is that in about two or three weeks now, we're not that far away, Orange Lounge Radio Studio is moving.
So in the new studio, the webcam will be set up completely differently.
Above my head.
It'll be interesting to see how we set it up in the new studio.
You can put it on my head and have the Sakura cam.
Well, the weird thing is we're not going to be able to do the iToy cam either, so we'll have to get creative.
Who cares?
I have another webcam.
I just don't use it because I didn't like it.
I haven't really thought the logistics of the webcam out yet, so we'll see.
Anyway, question from LXLDubes.
Why haven't we gotten Orange Lounge Radio t-shirts yet?
Pay for them.
The problem with t-shirts is that...
In order to get t-shirts, you have to buy a bunch of them up front.
And if you're not able to sell them, then you have to take a loss.
And none of us are financially able to take a loss right now.
What we may do, I do want to do t-shirts.
I think we have enough of a following where we could get enough small t-shirts.
But it would be the type of thing where it's like pre-order, and I know a lot of folks don't like the pre-order thing, but that's just so that we wouldn't lose any money, you know, and we'd only order enough shirts for those that would pre-order it.
So if we do do shirts in the future, which we are wanting to do before E3, so you may see this coming in the next month, it would probably be something where it's pre-order only.
But we'll post more details to the website when we know more information.
We also have to get some shirt designs.
We don't know exactly what we want right now.
OLR that hot?
That's pretty good.
That hot.
We'll see.
Excuse me.
MPQ wants to know, What should I do if my Beatmania 2DX arrives before my flip-top PS2 does?
Wait longer.
You shouldn't have bought a modded PS2 to begin with.
That's pretty stupid.
Only buy the real thing.
Look at the manual and look how pretty the manual is.
Try to translate the Japanese in the manual.
That would be fun.
And see, those of us who actually have a JPS2 will be enjoying their 2DX because we bought a JPS2.
Oh, we just had our typo of the night in the chat room.
Somebody was trying to say this.
Dark Knight said, Orange Lounge Radio is almost classified as a clut.
Meant to say cult, but say clut.
We just need t-shirts with typos on them.
Shut up, clut.
LemonLimeJump says, I plan on gathering up a posse to get a DDR machine put in at my college.
What's a good mix to get?
I guess everyone will have a different opinion, but what does everyone in the studio think?
My opinion is that extreme is kind of horrid.
You can go almost everywhere and find an extreme.
So really, for me, it's all about the retro at this point.
So I think a good DDR mix, it would be fun to have retro.
So either Fourth Plus, I think Fourth Plus is definitely a great one to have, Fifth Mix, or Third Korean.
Fourth Plus, Third Plus.
3rd Plus is kind of expensive, though.
3rd Koreans you can get pretty cheap, can't you?
2nd Mix was fun, because 2nd Mix had step battle in it, and nothing is as cool as step battle.
I would urge you to do just whatever's cheap and affordable for your college, which I believe 3rd Korean's the cheapest, so that or 4th Plus.
5th Mix would be a good deal, too, because there were a lot of songs in 5th Mix that didn't show up anywhere else.
So, I think Fifth Mix is definitely something good to check out.
But don't get, I mean, if you, of course you could always get an extreme, but the thing is that everybody has an extreme.
So it really depends, and I don't know what kind of area you live in, but check out DDR Freak machine locations, put in your zip code, and see what kind of machines are in your area.
And if you have three or four extreme machines within ten miles, well...
then go for something different and that'll kind of lure people to the college.
It'll lure the people to play those extreme machines to, you know, old stuff is new again.
I'm actually surprised nobody in our chat room said, F that, get in the groove!
Which really would be another option, honestly.
That might be something you might want to see if there's interest in.
I'm not going to dog on in the groove, but you know.
LemonLimeJump just wants to clarify, this is Pensacola.
Unfortunately, I don't know the Pensacola area.
What school?
I've been to Florida one time.
I don't know.
I lived an hour from Pensacola.
What school?
I don't know.
I'll wait for Lemon Lime Jump to respond.
I'll talk to Lemon Lime Jump.
Just PM me.
Okay.
But here's the thing.
I've been in Florida for a whopping one hour in my life and it was a layover when I was seven years old.
Alright, anyway.
Uh, Flaronay says, do you guys still have the Let Them Move MP3?
If so, can you play it at the end of the show, please?
Um, do you have that, Loki?
Wasn't that your thing to let them move the cow?
Doing the Let Them Move?
You remember that?
Do you have that?
Can you find it?
Can you see if you still have it so I can play it?
Okay, see if you have that.
We can fit that in for you, Flaronay.
It's pretty funny and we haven't done that joke in months.
Ranma says, seriously, are we going to see some Orange Launch Radio t-shirts?
Yes, we want to do the t-shirts.
We will have something up within the next couple weeks.
We just need a shirt designed, so we need some folks to design a shirt for us.
Hint, hint.
Hint!
Maybe we'll do a contest.
We have CDs to give away.
We could do a contest.
Don't we have anime screeners, too, that have to get given away?
We got the Appleseed prize pack still we got to give away at some point, huh?
Maybe we'll do a contest.
That might be fun.
LemonLimeJump, just wanted to clarify, it's UWF is the school she goes to.
University of West Florida.
I guess, yeah.
RPGKing7 says, question, how are you guys able to get into E3?
DDRFreak.
DDRFreak is a registered business, so DarkSakura is able to get in that way.
Loki?
I do game sales at my company.
I don't think you can get any more in the business than that.
Unfortunately, that leaves me out in the cold this year.
Last year I had some buddies at a particular gaming company that we talk an awful lot about on this station that helped me get into E3 and helped Loki get in as well.
Unfortunately, I don't have that luxury this year, so I'm kind of on my own.
So I don't know if I'm going to E3 this year.
I will find out this week.
So we'll have something on that on Sunday because I'm going to send in the paperwork this week, so we'll see what happens.
But actually, if I do get into E3, it'll be strictly because of Orange Lounge Radio.
Which is kind of cool, but we are an official business as well now too, so... Anyway, um... SSJ100Matt Which are better video game movies or comic book based movies?
By the way, you gotta play Girls Butts.
Girls Butts is so two weeks ago, we'll see.
We'll see about the Girls Butts thing.
Um...
What are better video game... Oh, which is better?
Video game based movies or comic book based movies?
On the whole, I would say comic book based movies have been better.
I would definitely second that.
That's like comparing a BB gun with a thermonuclear warhead.
There's no comparison.
I mean, when you look at, like, the old school Batman, I mean, that alone, right there, and then maybe, um, what else, Spider-Man was really good, it's comic book movies are awesome, and, unfortunately, um, you know, the, uh, um, of course, there have been bad comic book movies, Catwoman.
You know, that wasn't, that wasn't the comic book's fault, that was the director's fault, and we know who that director is, and we are trying to stop them as we speak, you know?
That wasn't you, Ebol, that directed Catwoman, was it?
I think... You sure?
Let me check.
I'm gonna check.
I'm almost positive.
You do that.
You check.
Go to the database.
But find the let them move thing first.
We need that.
I can't is not a term I understand.
All right.
Alright, we're running out of questions here.
No more questions, at least I see, for Ask Orange Lounge, unless I missed something.
I don't think so.
So we're going to go ahead and close up the old mailbag there.
And what we're going to do now is we're going to take a quick break, just a quick two-song break, and we're going to come back and a couple quick other little stories and notes, and then we're going to end tonight's show.
So we will be back after this, featuring a very, very old DDR song and a very, very new DDR song.
So we'll be back after this.
Boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob
Thank you for watching.
See you next time.
Thank you for watching!
Oh, Ash!
This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.
I don't even know if anyone gets that promo anymore.
That was when we were at the house for the show.
That was the first studio.
And they were watching Hentai on the main TV.
And I walk into the room and the first thing I see is animated ass all over the screen.
So like, oh, ass.
And then we made the promo.
And suddenly it was a promo.
All right, just so you guys know, we actually found something that we promised we would play.
So we're going to do one other song here for you guys.
So enjoy this.
You should get a kick out of this or not.
This is NMR featuring Jackazid.
Enjoy.
The money's a jaffa, so is the sideline, the mic's a deadline, but take the rewind, use them as guidelines, and it's wobble, wobble, wobble, wobble, wobble, wobble, wobble, wobble, wobble,
Sounds like a dying cow at the end.
No, Wilbert's just a spring, although that's a horse, but whatever.
That was an old fortune cookie.
Like years ago.
That was like from episode 4.
That feels weird.
I don't think it's that old.
Oh yeah, it is that old because this was when I was still not eating beef.
And we went to, we were going to Panda Express.
And I had that nasty eggplant crap.
And then we were trying to think of what we were going to do.
I was like, this eggplant makes me think of Dead Horse.
Thanks for watching!
I always love doing this.
We bring this up once every couple months or so.
And since the show's gotten some additional new listeners lately, we'll do this one more time here.
We used to do these, but they kind of took a lot of work, so we don't really do them so much anymore.
But we used to do these little flashback promos.
They're hilarious.
Listen to this.
Take a look back at episode number one.
Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.
Join us every Sunday night from 7 o'clock until 9 o'clock.
Yeah, you see how old that is?
That's when we were on this old schedule there.
So, very interesting there.
Listen to how horrible our microphones were, too.
I was using the headset.
You could hear Irene in the background.
She sounded like she was in a tin can.
You know, like, what is going on, you guys?
I'm on Orange Lounge.
I was using the headset and I ended up with like a migraine by the end of the show.
Remember I passed out in the show?
That was terrible.
We were in the front.
We were in the living room.
That was certainly fun.
And then I went to LA.
You did.
So you were gone for a couple weeks.
Let's do one more flashback.
These are kind of fun.
I like the flashbacks.
So you guys can respect the roots of Orange Lingerie.
Let's do a flashback from episode... Let's do a flashback from episode four.
on Orange Lounge Radio.
Oh, every night on the show.
As Irene makes his face.
Orange Lounge Radio makes you moist as a snake.
Join us every Sunday night from 7 p.m.
until 9 p.m.
Pacific Standard Time for the Orange Lounge.
Jamie was moist.
and I still am.
I remember she got pissed off about that one too.
I did.
She's like, don't put that in the promo.
You can't.
Why did you do that?
Rob, why?
Rob.
But now she can laugh about it.
Rob.
I said.
Rob.
What?
Rob.
What?
Rob.
Yes.
Ah.
Loki, before we finish up the show, give us some more PSP hacking news, because this is what you're all about ever since you got a PSP.
I noticed you were watching a video earlier.
Yeah, tell us about that, too.
That was the great game launcher.
You honestly have to, like, seriously twist a PSP to get it to launch a game.
And I don't know about you, but who twists a fucking, you know, console system?
Wipeout!
You don't need to twist a damn game for Wipeout!
I don't twist it when I play Wipeout.
This isn't, like, some sort of JogCon type thing.
This is, you know, a game system.
You don't try to twist it.
Of course it's gonna break.
It's not meant to twist.
God, people are retarded.
Anyways, so yeah, apparently the PSP IRC thing has been slash dotted, so that went that site.
And same with the PSP browser, that has been slash dotted as well, so that site's down.
What's this?
Haha, funny.
Oh man, honestly, who the hell does this kind of stuff is what I want to know.
Another news, though.
We'll be reporting this later.
It has been done, and the first alpha will be coming out next month.
That's right, Linux is on the DS.
Go Linux.
If it runs with electricity, there will be Linux on it.
Linux for the toaster.
I want Linux for a toaster.
And from what I read, iTunes.
iTunes for the PSP.
I will never understand what the charm is about being able to install Linux on insert system here.
I don't understand.
Is that just because people think they're going to be able to run all the Linux programs on it and everything?
I don't understand.
Why do people try to install Linux on, like, what was the one we had?
The fish on the wall had Linux installed on it?
What the hell is that?
You know what I want to do?
And I realized this the other day when I was looking at my PSP.
I'm like, what the hell is this button?
What is this thing?
What is this little thing on the top here?
It's an infrared port.
So you know what you can do?
You can use this as a remote.
I want a program on here where I can turn off TVs with the PSP.
So you can walk around Walmart just, you know, getting the electronics out.
Oh, I'm just, I'm trying out a PSP.
Click, click, click, click, all the TVs are going off.
Actually, I want to get one.
Didn't you order one of those keychains?
I thought you were going to order the keychain that shuts them all off.
No, I never got around to that.
Damn.
We need to get one and we need to figure out how to increase the strength of this.
And go in the Best Buy.
Watch the magic.
Like an EMP?
I don't remember.
I don't remember what it does, but it's like a little thing that you put on your keychain.
And what it does is it basically cycles through like a hundred different popular televisions and their power off signal.
That's awesome, I want one.
So you can like go in, if the TV's too loud at a restaurant or whatever, you just get out your little keychain, boop, and if you hold it for 15 seconds, eventually the TV will turn off.
I still want the portable EMP, so I can aim it at people's cell phones while they're driving.
I was thinking, I need to find the...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I found three different networks.
One with the password on it.
Well, actually, two with passwords.
One that's not.
So, you know, it's sort of like, you know, a dumb person's version of, you know, I forget, War Driving.
You should walk around the complex and you just look like you're playing your PSP.
But can you download files from the networks?
No, not on the PSP yet.
Not yet, but I was reading some other things today on the site.
There's a cord out there for the Mini-B, which is this little mini-USB port.
This is a proprietary thing, of course, to Sony, their Mini-B.
It's USB-A, which is your standard USB, the female part, so you can actually plug in USB devices to the Mini-B port.
So, in theory, you could put flash drives or whatever, USB flash drives, hook it up to the PSP via this...
or, like I was thinking, a portable hard drive.
Imagine, 160 gigs on my PSP.
Anyway, more PSP pirating and hacking news to come later on Orange Lounge Radio.
But for now, that's it.
Three hours are up.
Tune into the podcast if you want to know more.
Time to go around and get everybody's final thought.
Angel, your final thought.
I need to recharge my PSP, er, not PSP, DS.
Yeah, my brain's not working.
Bye.
Julie.
I want to kill some Sims.
It's fun.
Killing Sims is fun.
Uh, Loki!
Now, do you have the, um, the, uh, what was it, the college update for, um, Sims 2?
Not yet, but I want to get that.
Then I can kill more of them.
Okay.
and my final thought is I like money.
DarkSakura, your final thought.
Reject false icons.
Last word of the show.
One word to sum it all up.
I'm going to give it to Julie tonight.
One word to sum everything up and it's the final word of the show.
Good night, everybody.
See you next week.
Thanks for listening.
And the word of the day is cat.
Mashed Potatoes!
Hey, Sweet Potatoes, Baked Potatoes, Potato Chips, Whoa, Smoked Sausage, Fried Chicken, Pepperoni Pizza, and Deluxe Dips.
Nobody can make a donut, do the things you do.
Believe me baby, believe me baby, I've tried what I feel, I've eaten meatballs in Sweden, and pork chops in Peru, but all I did, all I did, all I did, all I did, all I did was remind me of you baby, and your mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, oh baby, mashed butter.
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
All right, that's going to do it for tonight's show, everybody.
Thanks a lot for listening and supporting us, as always.
We appreciate your support.
We are going to go from our live broadcast mode to our basic broadcast, so you're going to get disconnected.
We'll just reconnect to the stream in about 15 seconds to resume listening to all your favorite EDR, 2DX, and Dance Mania favorites.
But first, a thought for you guys.
In the studio, we have actually a clock.
Laziness prevails again.
And on that thought, have a great night everybody.
We'll see you next week.
Reconnect in 15 seconds.
