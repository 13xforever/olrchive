552	4054	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of April 4th, 2005.
5615	8757	And now, the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition.
9057	15561	Your internet radio home for discussion on rhythm and music gaming and all the news on video games that don't suck.
16001	20343	And now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
21404	23665	Hello everybody on the internet.
24766	27968	Welcome to another edition of the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition.
29717	31458	What's going on in the video gaming world?
32239	39303	And with you is myself, my name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky, and my lovely co-host Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.
39683	40843	I am such a celebrity.
41824	44825	And our other third wheel, say hello to Loki.
45906	46426	Hello.
47367	47707	All right.
48362	58931	So we're going to talk about some gaming news going on in the world, and of course, tons of PSP stuff, because, you know, this PSP has been this gigantic, like, Katamari Dimash-y ball just rolling down a hill.
59652	61013	It's what's popular this week.
61073	61814	It's the big thing.
62134	65917	So we'll talk about some PSP news, but first, what's going on in your gaming world, DarkSakura?
67198	75205	I've been playing a lot of the games on the Gorillas.com site, like Widescreen Pong and Helidrop.
76178	77018	It's been pretty fun.
77218	79039	So no, like, consoles or anything?
80140	81741	I looked at Final Fantasy XI.
82041	83261	I didn't actually play it, though.
83281	83801	You looked at it.
83821	84482	You just checked it out.
84502	86002	I moved my play online icon.
87663	88664	I've been too busy.
88824	89944	I've been doing other stuff.
90204	92145	And, of course, being a famous internet celebrity.
92765	94586	Did you move it to the recycle bin?
94626	95827	Or where did you move the icon?
97027	97428	Elsewhere.
97968	98588	Oh, okay.
100069	100529	So that's it?
100569	101109	Not a lot of games anymore?
101129	102950	I can't be bothered with that kind of thing anymore.
103390	104711	I'm a famous internet celebrity.
104731	104891	Okay.
105282	106303	I forgot, I'm so sorry.
107524	107844	That's it?
109326	110246	I'm busy being famous.
111307	112869	Loki!
113409	115011	I bought a PSP.
115491	116092	Sucker!
116592	117613	No, that's cool.
117913	119354	If I could afford it, I'd buy one too.
119535	120455	I'm with the trends.
121556	123318	No, I got a PSP and I got two games.
123338	125460	I got the Wipeout Pure just because...
126631	128151	I like to hack my PSP.
128612	129632	You bought Wipeout, period.
129652	132793	It has nothing to do with the fact that you like Wipeout.
132833	136374	I distinctly remember you saying you were disappointed with the Wipeout series.
136914	138294	I hated Wipeout, actually.
138474	143096	But you just wanted to buy it because you know it's the game that allows people to hack their PSPs.
143676	144476	Yep.
144576	146797	But I like Wipeout now because I've been playing it.
146917	147797	It's actually pretty fun.
148217	148717	I don't know.
148917	151998	I tried Wipeout 3 a while back and I tried Wipeout XL.
152018	153038	I just didn't get into it.
154459	155159	Now, you know what?
155563	157949	I need to bring over my pair of Negcons.
157969	160375	I need to play Wipeout with a Negcon.
162280	162761	What is that?
163625	166346	Namco Controller, the twisty one.
166906	169007	And then the one with the little dial is the JogCon.
169707	171688	I have a JogCon that's completely useless.
171708	172848	I have like three JogCons.
173588	178950	So yeah, I got Wipeout Pure and I got Twisted Metal head-on, I think.
179690	180950	I love Twisted Metal.
181230	184451	I mean, Twisted Metal head-on, though, is exactly like Twisted Metal 2.
184671	185192	That's all it is.
185552	191453	But, hey, if you're going to make a remake of one of the original games, Twisted Metal 2 would be the one to do it, because that was one of the best.
191774	192934	Why didn't you get Luminous?
193444	196305	because they weren't selling Luminous and I can only afford two games.
196465	198705	So, you know, those were the two.
198965	202346	It was either that or, you know, I get, like, some stupid NFL game or something.
203146	211347	It's like, no thank you, I will take Twisted Metal Black, or not Black, Head On, and the White Belt here.
212808	214128	But, um, so I've been playing those.
214288	214648	They're fun.
215268	218969	And, um, I do not like, um,
219952	222653	I'm not a huge fan of Darkstalkers.
222673	225034	But it's really neat on the PSP.
225074	226154	I'll take your word for it.
226274	226774	I don't know.
226794	227135	I'm just like
249129	260115	The other reason I got one, though, work-related, because my boss just got one, and I figured, you know, it'd be kind of cool to just, you know, play against him during, like, a break or something, or just to be able to actually play some of the games.
260435	266218	Also, I want to drag it with me to E3, because you know they're going to have Wi-Fi hotspots there, and you know there's going to be, like, PSP crap there.
266779	269280	So, might as well drag my portable systems with me.
269460	270961	Brown-nosing with a PSP.
271121	271561	Very nice.
272142	272622	Exactly.
272842	273762	Alright, great.
274822	281944	As far as what's going on in my gaming world, I was, you know, obviously, since Loki's my roommate, I was checking out his PSP a little bit, so I played a little bit of Wipeout as well.
282264	283804	I suck at Wipeout, though, so forget it.
285105	287885	But I kind of want a PSP, but I'm going to wait for some later games.
287965	292927	I really, really want Luminous, but it's not enough for me to justify spending so much money on a system at this point.
293527	293947	Maybe later.
294127	298708	The one I want is actually, they have that cool one where you disable bombs.
298728	299388	That looked kind of neat.
300032	301354	I don't remember the name of that one offhand.
303196	303396	Oh well.
303796	305158	Anyway, so I'll get a PSP eventually.
305218	306099	But it's very pretty.
306159	311145	I was watching Spider-Man, even though I've already seen Spider-Man 2 twice and didn't really want to watch it again.
311185	312767	I just wanted to see what the video looked like on there.
312787	313708	I was quite impressed.
314215	315715	I have to admit, it's pretty nice looking.
315735	318956	You can also, though, download video from your computer.
319897	322478	I was telling Loki he needs to put some pornography on there.
322518	325859	GameStop's going to be carrying the one gigabyte cards coming up soon.
326779	331040	Now, in order to download that stuff, I've got to buy an additional piece of crap that's got to go with it.
331060	334041	You can just bring our cable over and you can borrow it.
334538	337599	I need to get me a 1 gig stick.
337679	340340	Actually, I'm not even... Because I don't know how much those 1 gig sticks are.
340400	342280	What, they're like 200 some dollars or something?
342300	342540	Yikes!
342780	343860	Not necessarily.
344020	347001	I think Best Buy was having them for about $130 something.
347141	349362	Okay, fuck that, because you know what?
349662	357684	You can actually go out there and buy... There's a USB to Mini-B, which is the USB thing that's on top of the PSP.
358833	361814	Adaptor for $13 and then hook up your wonderful flash drives.
361854	362174	Guess what?
362194	364554	My flash drive is like, you know, 128 megs right there.
365054	365754	And what, I bought that for $20?
366035	367055	Fuck that.
367095	371416	Why the hell would I go spend, you know, tons of money to buy this, you know, proprietary crap?
371656	372796	It's a good idea in theory.
372856	373516	I just hope it works.
373536	373776	In theory.
374016	374636	I hope it works.
375136	377317	But, you know, I'm just interested.
377377	382778	Right now I've been like jumping on the Wi-Fi spots, you know, people that are neighbors and stuff that,
383237	386221	Have internet and then they put wireless routers without passwords on them.
386361	387342	Hey, this is my gaming week.
387943	388143	Sorry.
388383	388723	That's alright.
390153	393015	So instead I picked up a new DS game.
393315	396777	I was like, you know, I didn't want to spend $300 on a PSP, but I had to spend money.
396837	400959	Like, you know, that money was burning a hole in my pocket because I just did my taxes and I'm getting money back and all that.
401419	404701	So I instead decided to go out and buy a new game for the DS.
404801	408263	The unfortunate thing is that the DS really doesn't have a whole lot of games on it.
408683	413305	And so, you know, I already have Mario 64 and I already have WarioWare Touch.
413325	414146	So what does that leave?
414286	414926	Not a whole lot.
415226	416349	I already have Field of Magic.
416810	421399	So it was pretty much, it came down between Sprung and this other title, Yoshi Touch and Go.
421479	422862	So I picked up Yoshi Touch and Go.
424486	425087	Not impressed.
426089	426570	Not impressed.
427486	430048	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
456092	457753	Touch and bye, as far as I'm concerned.
459194	460535	Let's get into some gaming news.
460615	463256	Loki found some fun little customizable things.
463416	465237	One's for the Xbox and one's for the PSP.
465278	467079	What did you find, Loki, for the Xbox?
467179	470240	Well, if you happen to love Hello Kitty, like we all do.
470260	470801	Yay!
471337	486726	Okay, no, we all don't, but, you know, what a way to ruin a perfectly good Crystal, you know, Xbox case by shoving some stupid Hello Kitty crap on it for Hello Kitty Mission Rescue, the special edition Crystal console that you can get.
487706	500053	It's basically... So, wait, wait, I just want to clarify, this isn't like a giant sticker you put on your existing Crystal console, which you can't even get in this country anyway, but it's a brand new Xbox that they're selling that is specifically Hello Kitty Mission Rescue.
500073	500153	Yeah.
500253	502535	Yep, with this crappy crystal... Cute!
502735	507639	It's a crystal console, which is, like, really awesome, but... I don't know.
507739	518487	Anyway, so, you know, before they had a pink Xbox, why you would buy an X... Yeah, because, you know, I've been really waiting for the Hello Kitty game to come out for me to buy an Xbox.
518507	520629	That's been the game that'll do it for me.
521169	525933	But anyways, so they have this, you know, Hello Kitty crystal Xbox console that you can get.
525993	526093	It's...
527148	531730	It comes with a crystal controller, which hopefully doesn't have this pink crap on it.
532110	534330	And the Mission Rescue game for $99.
536091	539272	With the purchase of a selected Samsung LCD TV.
539832	541293	And you can only get it in Singapore.
541713	542693	Or on eBay.
543833	545394	Where people would be selling it from Singapore.
547115	547695	So there's that.
548295	551136	Then, if you are the wonderful celebrity...
551894	557377	They've been doing Simmons Jeweler Company made some accessories for the Sony PSP.
558077	569383	They debuted this at March 14th at the Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood, dubbed the Pret-A-PSP, whatever that's supposed to mean.
569984	578168	And it says that brought together some of the hottest names in fashion, other well-known designers, including Marc Jacobs, Diane... Wait, wait, wait, wait.
578800	580762	This was a fashion show for PSPs.
581302	582043	Am I correct here?
582664	583865	Yes, I believe you're correct.
583885	584826	Wow.
584846	585607	That's stupid.
588354	593957	The top models including Maggie Reiser, Kirstie Hume, and people we don't care about.
593997	595738	Come on, no gamer cares about these people.
596019	601662	Anyway, so showed off the newest trend in fashion by wearing the sexy, sleek PSP accessories with the latest looks and fall.
601722	605564	What I love about this is that it's bling for your PSP is really what it is.
605624	606465	It's bling bling.
606505	607045	Like, look at this.
607385	613369	You've got this gold PSP and there's a whole other joke that can be made there about the golden PSP if anybody watches South Park.
613929	618913	You can get the gold PSP and you get these bling, bling chains that hang from it.
619954	620755	It's tacky.
620915	627360	And you want to know what... And you want to know how much this costs, folks?
627440	627841	Oh, God.
628822	631043	Because this isn't going to be for the average user.
631464	634146	I don't know why you'd want to buy one in the first place unless you're like some
634611	636012	Overpaid rapper with no taste.
637153	637714	It would be $35,000.
639115	642577	Woo!
643158	645740	$35,000 to make your PSP look like crap?
646200	654107	Okay, if I wanted to make the PSP look like crap, I could go to the craft store and buy, you know, sculpty plastic.
654927	655327	And paint it.
655388	658470	It says A-list celebrities showed up to this.
658970	660031	This is A-list...
661192	662712	I don't know how I know that, I just do.
662732	663333	Sorry guys.
686158	691323	And I don't know who bought this, but I know that David Arquette was there, and I know he's a big gamer, so he might have bought this.
691424	691764	I don't know.
691804	692525	You know what, though?
693005	696869	He was one that bought one of those pimped out DSs, I remember that.
697029	699011	So, who knows?
699272	700072	More power to him.
700253	701314	Pimp my game system.
702715	704977	In other news... Yeah, let's hear some DS news.
705097	709222	In other news in the DS, the other portable game world, we've been saying this is going to happen.
710446	719973	It says the PassMe, which for those who don't know, it's this device that's actually made to be able to port your own code using the Game Boy code thingy.
720193	722255	And what websites is this all being documented on?
723581	724982	on DSLinux.org.
725002	728245	That's right, they ported Linux to the DS.
728705	731547	The first alpha for it should be coming out in about a month, they say.
731847	732688	It's only a matter of time.
733349	734650	Oh, why, why, why?
734710	736471	And of course, it's got a computer chip in it.
736551	737832	Linux can be installed on it.
737972	744017	And as you could probably guess, they're already attempting to port Linux to the PSP.
744297	745798	Of course.
746159	749021	I'm personally porting Linux to my toaster oven.
749580	753522	Honestly, if Linux is so popular, why is it not outselling Windows?
758125	761587	In other DS news, you know they did the new colored DSs in Japan?
761627	763908	They have graphite black and pure white.
764248	771052	And I know we sit here and sometimes joke like, haha, Nintendo, you know, they just re-released the system in new colors to try and drive up sales.
771072	774694	But what kind of idiots actually buy the system all over again just for a new color?
775182	777383	Well, let me put this in a little bit of perspective for you guys.
778423	785286	Sales for the week of March 21st to the March 27th, when these new colors debuted, 54,000 units in Japan.
786166	787207	The previous week was only 21,000.
788327	791328	More than doubled the sales just by rolling out two new colors.
793329	800392	You know, and this kind of matches with that bling PSP story that there are people out there that will buy the gaming system to match their purse.
801138	810606	You know what's sad is people don't realize that you can actually go and find the mods yourself and do this for like a lot cheaper than buying a brand new system or paying $35,000.
811586	813027	We'll see what happens April 20th.
813128	819413	Yeah, for $35,000 I can make an all-in-one gaming unit with its own built-in like keg or something, you know.
820013	820513	Why pay $35?
820854	822615	I would pay for that.
822695	826838	I mean, why pay $35,000 for like a golden PSP?
826979	828520	A gaming system with a keg.
829111	833874	Which as soon as you drop it will be $35,000 wasted.
834655	836396	A gaming system with a keg?
836696	839077	One day we'll be famous and spending that kind of money on gaming systems.
839097	840038	I'm already famous!
840839	841719	Oh, I forgot, sorry.
842860	850685	We will see what happens to the sales of Japan's DS units on April 21st when Turquoise Blue and Candy Pink roll out.
851511	866202	and then Barf Green you know there's people out there that want a candy pink DS just you wait for the transparent crystal DS to be coming out and then they'll have crystal pink and crystal blue and then there's baby shit yellow green look, moving on
873999	874959	Here's some interesting news.
875039	877220	You know the Four Swords that was out on GameCube?
877460	877900	No, I'm sorry.
877920	878601	I don't know about it.
878681	879581	Zelda Four Swords?
879721	880421	Certainly you've heard of this.
880441	881362	Come on.
881442	882462	Give me a break.
882502	888824	Well, not a lot of people really played this game because in order to do it, you had to have the link cables.
889225	893826	If you really wanted to get four people in on the fun, you had to have the link cables so everybody could be their own link.
895067	895847	We did that at my house.
896467	900929	Yeah, okay, but only the hardcore gaming nerds like yourself could really participate in this.
902093	902713	Who knows?
902774	904195	Something we'll see at E3 probably.
904215	904535	Who knows?
932513	938138	April Fool's was this past week and of course a lot of websites rolled out their own ha ha funny stuff.
938498	939800	Not that we would ever do this.
939820	941061	We didn't participate at all.
941081	942582	No, we don't believe in April Fool's Day.
942602	944745	We didn't do anything on the site, nothing in LiveJournal.
944765	945926	Absolutely nothing.
946346	949890	We would never make up stories about being bought or anything like that.
949930	950490	We'd never do that.
950530	952032	Why would we ever sell out anyway?
952052	952532	Yeah, exactly.
952572	953233	We would never sell out.
956434	958775	Here's some popular April Fools jokes you might have seen.
959095	960375	These are all jokes, by the way.
960495	962256	Epic Games announcing Unreal 3.
962836	963156	Sorry.
963997	964737	This was funny.
965017	971139	Slashdot said that online support for the PlayStation 2 version of Final Fantasy XI is going to be discontinued.
971599	973840	Just to piss off the people who spent $99 on the hard drive.
974821	977261	That's beautiful, and actually that would be a dream come true.
977601	982283	World of Warcraft is going to incorporate, and this was announced on World of Warcraft's site.
982323	984464	They are incorporating Slash Panda.
985754	992355	So you can get deliveries from Pandaren Express, and it comes delivered to you with a guy dressed in costume.
993876	999157	This is an April Fool's joke, mind you, not a reality, but the pictures were so cute, because it actually had a little panda in the game.
999537	1000057	So cute.
1002717	1009219	Let's see, also, other stories that were going on, we had OC Remix announcing a partnership with EA.
1010783	1017085	and let's see, computer and video games announcing that Shrek 2 characters will be in the GameCube release of Soul Calibur 3.
1019645	1020205	Barf.
1020826	1022026	That would be hilarious.
1022106	1023286	I play this as the dragon.
1023606	1026107	What I thought was really funny is something that GameSpot did.
1026127	1036010	They actually ran an article saying that John Woo had actually bought the rights to the Katamari Damacy movie and it was going to star The Rock as the Prince of All Cosmos.
1036790	1037590	That's great.
1038951	1040252	I would actually pay to see that.
1040312	1046875	So I'm going to bestow the winner to the best April Fool's prank on GameSpot for the Katamari Damacy starring The Rock.
1047155	1057960	Other really crappy nominations would go to Alakazam for saying that Final Fantasy XI and World of Warcraft merged, which fooled no one.
1058240	1058460	And...
1062324	1068228	Yeah, Slashdot really sucked because they had a ton of, all the articles on April 1st were all fake, so that's too bad.
1068288	1071871	I still never checked GameFacts.com because they do something every year.
1072251	1076674	Like one year they did, this was a few years ago, they did Xbox Facts.
1076694	1079676	That's the one I remember, that they got bought by Microsoft or something.
1080336	1088122	I think somebody was telling me all the mods banned themselves or something, but if you're not a member of the community, you may not have seen it, I don't know, so we'll see.
1088562	1093883	Anyway, Orange Lounge Radio, we're not just here to talk about video games all the time.
1093923	1099964	Because if you live, eat, breathe, sleep video games, you're never going to get laid.
1100844	1103985	So we're here also to give you advice on how to better your life.
1104025	1111326	And who better than, I believe you could be, DarkSakura, the only podcast video game female.
1111526	1113466	I could be wrong, but you may be.
1113947	1116367	So she's here to give you her little bit of advice.
1117466	1119227	So what is the advice you're going to give tonight?
1122628	1125449	Today's bit of advice is how to survive a nuclear explosion.
1127250	1134633	In the event of a nuclear war or explosion, get to a safe shelter as quickly as possible and remain inside for four to six days after the last explosion.
1137694	1143716	An underground shelter covered by one meter or more of earth will provide the best protection against nuclear explosion and fallout radiation.
1144514	1149396	If you must emerge, limit your surface exposure to no more than 30 minutes a day for 13 days following the explosion.
1150677	1154159	If you have been exposed to radiation, immediately wash your body thoroughly with soap and water.
1154459	1156760	This will remove most of the radiation particles, but not all.
1157541	1166305	Water can be safely obtained from underground sources , that undergo natural filtration, or from pipes in houses or stores.
1167062	1172165	Healthy looking wild animals are a safe food source if other food sources are not available.
1172565	1175147	Avoid any meat close to the bones and joints.
1175507	1178049	An animal skeleton holds more than 90% of the radioactivity.
1179690	1180990	Any last pieces of advice?
1181451	1181791	Yeah.
1182371	1183412	Don't live in Iraq.
1186494	1186794	Alright.
1187901	1188441	Moving on.
1188721	1192262	We talked briefly about an April Fool's joke that involves Soul Calibur 3.
1192302	1193763	Well, here's something that's not a joke.
1193843	1196783	Some recent details being announced on Soul Calibur 3.
1197744	1203365	Interview with a games producer revealed on the official Japanese Soul Calibur 3 site.
1203385	1204946	Some official things revealed.
1205386	1210307	They will not be doing guest characters on PlayStation 2, although they have received offers.
1211207	1215649	They've received offers, but the policy is we don't do the same thing twice.
1216209	1217169	Crash Bandicoot.
1218072	1219174	Please no, please no.
1219575	1220296	God, no.
1222160	1225245	I like the idea of having the prince of all cosmos, you know, just roll people over.
1225506	1227209	What about Sonic?
1227734	1229015	Nope, not gonna happen, sorry.
1229095	1230396	There was already Sonic Fighters.
1230616	1238683	Here's the other bummer, a lot of people had their hopes up about this, but it was confirmed by the game's producer, no online play.
1238763	1241104	You can go online, the PS2, who'd have thunk it?
1242045	1250392	The official reason here, at the current time, the online infrastructure is extremely different between countries, and there's people that can't enjoy network gaming.
1250712	1254575	We've decided to concentrate on improving the game's offline content,
1254935	1258403	and its characters so that people all over the world will be able to have fun.
1259525	1260446	That was nice of them.
1260706	1264848	Well, it seems like just kind of a, to me it's more of like a, you know, cheap.
1264948	1270051	Well, we didn't want to do the online thing because we want to make offline better.
1270131	1272373	Well, of course we want to make offline better.
1272713	1275435	The idea is to do both really well, but whatever.
1275715	1282499	We've been holding off on doing online because we're worried about how Tekken 5 is going to beat our ass senseless.
1283159	1284200	But it's all Namco.
1284660	1285621	It's all Namco either way.
1286889	1288330	They're getting the money.
1288771	1290072	Oh, no!
1290332	1291473	You just got game served.
1295217	1295557	Let's see.
1295617	1296078	Moving on.
1296158	1301423	Capcom doing a little bit of ego inflation this week with a press release talking about their game sales.
1302646	1306369	Talking about their series, how successful their game series are.
1306689	1307329	What would you think?
1307810	1308350	Just asking.
1308370	1310892	Now, you're reading, Loki, so you can't guess.
1310912	1314354	But if you had to guess, what is Capcom's number one series of all time?
1314374	1315615	What would you guess, DarkSakura?
1315635	1316075	Street Fighter.
1316356	1316916	Street Fighter.
1317276	1318897	Street Fighter is number two.
1321139	1322700	They're on the sales chart.
1322720	1326843	24 million cumulative units over 53 different titles.
1327663	1328204	Breath of Fire.
1328885	1335106	Breath of Fire is number 10 on the list.
1335606	1337407	13 titles, 3 million units.
1337507	1339147	What the fuck else did Capcom do?
1343608	1345709	Mega Man would be number 3 on the list.
1347389	1348149	95 games.
1348369	1349509	Strider!
1349729	1350389	22.9 million units.
1350409	1351390	Strider not on the list.
1351610	1352530	Strider's awesome.
1353810	1354410	I'll give you a hint.
1355531	1357571	It was a series so huge they made movies out of it.
1359534	1364117	Well, they made Street Fighter movies too, but we don't deny the existence of that.
1364458	1366799	If you don't get this right, you're going to end up in a Jamie's sandwich.
1373945	1374985	Resident Evil!
1375446	1377307	Resident Evil is the number one!
1377467	1378668	Okay, you know what?
1378748	1380830	Remember the dialogue in the first one?
1380970	1381770	Jill's sandwich!
1381790	1383232	You don't want to end up in a Jill's sandwich.
1383692	1384873	Shut up, Barry, you bitch!
1386600	1388643	26 million units with 38 titles.
1388683	1389604	Other titles on the list.
1389644	1391146	Number 4, Disney titles.
1391226	1391847	Various titles.
1392207	1393389	Number 5, Onimusha.
1393850	1394671	6, Devil May Cry.
1394691	1395872	7, Dino Crisis.
1396012	1396974	8, Ghosts and Goblins.
1397815	1398856	9, Final Fight.
1398876	1399958	Devil May Cry.
1400198	1401620	Dude, I have every Final Fight game.
1402657	1404258	That would be all eight titles?
1404598	1405239	There's eight titles?
1405359	1408341	I have... Okay, well you don't need to... The first three I have it on Sega CD.
1408501	1409742	I have Mighty Final Fight.
1410342	1411503	I have Final Fight Guy.
1411923	1412424	That's it.
1412444	1416307	That's... Wow, having Final Fight Guy and some of the other stuff, those were rare titles.
1417167	1417487	Anyway.
1417988	1418188	Yeah.
1418368	1418588	Okay.
1418688	1419168	Anyway, sorry.
1419969	1420409	Moving on.
1421329	1422950	Doom 3 is coming out this week.
1423210	1424310	You want to pick it up at midnight?
1424731	1425551	Blockbuster.
1425651	1427892	They have that gaming division called Game Rush.
1427952	1429192	They're going to be doing a midnight sale.
1429552	1430752	Monday, April 4th.
1431013	1434414	So by the time some of you guys hear this, you may already have your copy of Doom 3.
1434914	1436734	Remember, this is the Xbox version, of course.
1437795	1444297	And if you are so lucky as to live near the Game Rush on Hillcrest Avenue in Dallas...
1445287	1450592	There will actually be some folks from ID Software there in person to give autographs because I guess they're famous.
1451673	1452854	But not as famous as we are.
1453134	1454135	We're internet celebrities.
1454355	1455136	You know what I heard?
1455356	1455536	What?
1455777	1457338	And this is not an April Fool's joke.
1458539	1460581	It's about games coming out and stuff.
1461542	1462102	Take two.
1462823	1465626	They have the rights now to Duke Nukem Forever.
1465846	1466907	It's supposed to be coming out.
1468051	1471452	Wow, that would be something else to finally see that damn game.
1471472	1475473	And Take-Two, I mean, I imagine they'd be able to be on top of that stuff.
1476474	1480135	We might actually see this before the turn of the next millennia.
1480435	1481515	We'll see, we'll see.
1482315	1484796	Alright, couple quick stories to finish out on Squeenix.
1484816	1486837	We haven't talked a whole lot about Squeenix tonight, of course.
1487217	1489357	Squenix, or Squareenix, whatever you want to say.
1489517	1490758	We like to call him Squeenix.
1490818	1491298	Squeenix!
1493004	1495785	Squeenix is doing a brand new role-playing game.
1496945	1506408	It's Code Age Commanders is the name of this, and it's going to be an action role-playing game set on a futuristic, post-apocalyptic planet.
1506788	1508569	I love that word, post-apocalyptic.
1509489	1510049	Aren't they all?
1510410	1512071	Squeenix doing an RPG?
1512151	1512811	Who would have thought?
1513432	1513912	No.
1514833	1522738	A game is being produced by Naora Yusuki, who worked as an artist for many of Squeenix's games, including Final Fantasy X and Unlimited Saga.
1523118	1526200	Very, very good Squeenix game and a very, very shitty Squeenix game.
1526280	1527381	I hate the Saga series.
1528262	1528962	It's no secret.
1529042	1530383	A bunch of people really like them.
1530683	1531144	I hate it.
1531364	1532906	Why don't they... Screw other people!
1533046	1539212	Why don't they, I don't know, direct their attention to, maybe, say, Einhänder 2?
1539673	1540974	No, we need Dew Prism 2.
1541795	1542235	Screw that.
1542275	1544618	How about getting Final Fantasy 12 out in a timely manner?
1545612	1547773	Just some suggestions if any folks from Squeenix are listening.
1551435	1551876	Let's see.
1552096	1558699	Also, by the way, Code H Commander, 50% complete, slated for release this year sometime in Japan.
1559260	1561381	Real quick note before we get into our last story tonight.
1561501	1566884	If you have any feedback for us, you can reach us via email to go at orangeloungeradio.com.
1567164	1569045	And we haven't done a mailbag section in a little while.
1569065	1573668	We haven't really gotten any letters that you folks want read on air, any questions that we can respond to.
1573748	1573848	So,
1574308	1575429	Definitely would like to see some of those.
1575469	1576889	Togo, all one word, T-O-G-O.
1576929	1579350	Why shouldn't they want their questions answered by us?
1579490	1580251	We're famous.
1582492	1584012	Thank you for the reminder, I forgot.
1584673	1586433	I can't let you forget, we are famous.
1586514	1590455	We have a social responsibility as internet superstars.
1590555	1593176	This is just community service, this program here, really.
1593196	1595217	You know, mentioning Togo makes me want a sandwich.
1596218	1596758	Togo!
1596878	1597818	Not Togo, it's Togo.
1597878	1598839	I think of Sana.
1600795	1601855	You want a Sana Witch?
1603917	1615986	Lastly, speaking of Konami, because we're talking about some of their artists there with Togo and Sana from the Beatmania series and various other Bomani series, Konami is going to be releasing mobile games in China.
1617967	1619008	But this is the interesting thing.
1619789	1624072	They're going to be releasing 30 games annually, they say, starting with
1624968	1629691	3 classic 1980s titles at 2 yuan per download.
1629851	1633334	By the way, that equivalents to 24 cents.
1634294	1634654	24 cents!
1635055	1638257	Contra, Antarctic Adventure, and Life Force.
1638925	1640406	Dude, Life Force Encontra!
1640426	1642287	Why don't we get anything this cool in the US?
1642327	1643027	That's what I want to know.
1643067	1645809	Because cell phone technology is like a million years better in Asia.
1646009	1651512	I just spent $5 on a brand new download that Sprint had, because Sprint's my cell phone company.
1651552	1654814	They have downloads for games too, and they sometimes have retro titles in there.
1654874	1657455	I deleted the games off of my cell phone because they sucked ass.
1657475	1659737	Well, I downloaded Impossible Mission.
1660037	1660437	Who knew?
1660497	1662378	They ported Impossible Mission to cell phones.
1662418	1664439	I was like, oh my gosh, that's the coolest thing ever.
1664459	1666220	It was like the best Commodore 64 game.
1666600	1666961	Cool.
1667061	1667761	On the cell phone.
1668394	1668774	Sucks.
1669334	1669795	Balls.
1670335	1672215	Yeah, waste of money.
1672936	1676717	Just so people can die of, you know, what do people die of in that game?
1676737	1677257	Die of death.
1677277	1680798	You caught diphtheria.
1680818	1681858	Diphtheria, thank you.
1681898	1683699	Anyways, trying to remember why people die, yes.
1684459	1686140	Wolves ate you.
1687260	1695703	Have you seen the commercial for Jamster where they're selling the, what was it, it was Rainbow Six for the cell phone?
1696516	1696856	Crap.
1697056	1699757	No, I don't pay attention to Jamster commercials because they're the devil.
1714799	1716100	Thanks for watching!
1737549	1741010	Will somebody just bring the cool shit over here from the other companies?
1741630	1744971	I will sign up with you guys so quick if I can get light force on my phone.
1744991	1750552	If I find out that if I go to Japan and buy a Kei Tai and it freaking works in the States, if my sim will work on it.
1750592	1751373	I don't think it will.
1751873	1755254	I'm still wanting to get one because you can get cell phones dirt cheap.
1757054	1759855	Alright, that's going to do it for this edition of the podcast.
1759895	1763056	Let's go around and see what everybody's final thoughts are.
1763136	1763856	Starting off with Loki.
1764838	1768800	My final thought is I hope I get paid soon because I need more games.
1770240	1772641	My final thought is DS, good game.
1773081	1773381	Now.
1774942	1775422	DarkSakura.
1775963	1776903	Reject false icons.
