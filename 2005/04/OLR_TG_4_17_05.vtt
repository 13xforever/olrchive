that you were pretty tired this week moving sucks for those of you guys who

are listening to the Sunday night show the three-hour program it was kind of a

01:03.040 --> 01:08.980
sappy show this week because full of pants well it was it was our um kind of

01:08.980 --> 01:13.580
goodbye to this studio as we evolve orange lounge radio is kind of evolving

01:13.580 --> 01:17.500
this podcast is a big part of that we're taking orange lounge radio our internet

01:17.500 --> 01:23.220
station we do on life 365 best of life 365 nominated broadcaster the year we're

01:23.220 --> 01:26.300
very excited about that those awards happen in a couple weeks so excited

01:26.300 --> 01:28.980
that we're taking our station on life is

01:28.980 --> 01:31.260
five and kind of revamping it to be a

01:31.260 --> 01:33.340
general video gaming station this

01:33.340 --> 01:35.780
podcast is big part of that again DDR

01:35.780 --> 01:37.700
fans shouldn't be too upset we're still

01:37.700 --> 01:39.540
going to have rhythm music games be a

01:39.540 --> 01:41.940
big big part of that but I believe dark

01:41.940 --> 01:43.140
sacri you said this a couple weeks ago

01:43.140 --> 01:44.260
and I think it describes this whole

01:44.260 --> 01:47.260
thing best we are gamer fans first DDR

01:47.260 --> 01:49.820
fans second yeah that's pretty much it

01:49.820 --> 01:52.380
because DDR fan DDR is a game so we're

01:52.380 --> 01:53.980
we're gamer fans before anything else

01:53.980 --> 02:02.800
else ddr is a subcategory of the gamer so this podcast we do is kind of the

02:02.800 --> 02:06.580
kickoff of that dedicated to other gaming things and we're all here all

02:06.580 --> 02:10.360
three of us are here live in person in studio somebody had asked a question a

02:10.360 --> 02:13.400
while back do you Skype in any of your clothes actually we don't we are all

02:13.400 --> 02:16.780
here live in the flesh so we can interact with each other I'm actually an

02:16.780 --> 02:23.880
artificial intelligent program here that just acts like me all right anyway let's

02:23.880 --> 02:26.880
Let's get to it. What's your game of the week been like? Dark Sakura?

02:26.880 --> 02:27.880
I ain't played shit.

02:27.880 --> 02:28.880
Really?

02:28.880 --> 02:33.880
No, um, actually I did play something, now that I think about it. I played the Jeep Simulator

02:33.880 --> 02:35.880
on the Gorillaz site.

02:35.880 --> 02:37.880
You and your web games?

02:37.880 --> 02:45.880
It's fun! Because if anyone has seen the 19-2000 video, they're on this big stretch of a highway

02:45.880 --> 02:52.880
being chased by aliens and salvation and things like that. And you can actually drive the whole freeway

02:52.880 --> 02:56.720
on. Okay, promise me this week you'll tear yourself on the website to play another game.

02:56.720 --> 03:01.560
You've got a house full of games. I played Legos too. Oh yeah, you can play the Lego

03:01.560 --> 03:06.080
game. I played the Star Wars Lego game and it was really cool because we got enough money

03:06.080 --> 03:11.360
in the game to unlock General Grievous and the next Star Wars movie he's supposed to

03:11.360 --> 03:16.280
kill like these four Jedi and uses their light sabers as his damn weapons and he's got four

03:16.280 --> 03:20.600
arms. It's really rad. So he's like kicking ass all the time and I'm over there using

03:20.600 --> 03:30.400
like Anakin all right hi I'm evil no spoilers hi I'm Vader all right anything

03:30.400 --> 03:35.000
else just the Lego game that's kind of it yeah well I'm glad you were able to

03:35.000 --> 03:37.840
tear yourself away to at least give that a try I'm curious I've been busy with

03:37.840 --> 03:42.480
school I had a lot of crap up I'm not huge on Star Wars I respect the films

03:42.480 --> 03:48.720
but I'm not like oh my god you know they're cool games there's some good

03:48.720 --> 03:52.240
games that come out of the series so I'm curious about this Lego star I think

03:52.240 --> 03:55.160
it's kind of hilarious the whole concept Lego meets Star Wars I think is the

03:55.160 --> 03:59.840
dumbest thing I've ever seen it was really stupid looking but it was fun it

03:59.840 --> 04:03.800
was really fun is what games are all about though okay good make a fun game

04:03.800 --> 04:07.800
that could be Star Wars not featuring Legos intelligent cube was a stupid

04:07.800 --> 04:10.520
looking game because I was like all of these falling cubes but it's it's one of

04:10.520 --> 04:14.000
the most brilliant PlayStation games they ever did squadron was fun this is

04:14.000 --> 04:17.280
why you don't see tickle me Elmo the game I mean that would be stupid but

04:17.280 --> 04:20.280
But that still doesn't stop them from putting Mary-Kate and Ashley games out.

04:20.280 --> 04:22.280
Loki, what's your game of the week been like?

04:22.280 --> 04:25.280
I played Luminous and I played Ridge Racer for the PSV.

04:25.280 --> 04:30.280
And they're fun. Lots of fun.

04:30.280 --> 04:39.280
Ridge Racer's pretty cool because it's like a throwback to the old R4, which is the best one I think that was available for the original PlayStation.

04:39.280 --> 04:44.280
And then they have R5 tracks in there as well. Those are pretty good.

04:44.280 --> 04:49.560
And then, you know, I guess you could unlock the intros for both of those games as well.

04:49.560 --> 04:51.040
It's just a lot of fun.

04:51.040 --> 04:54.680
Gotta play it against my boss, kicked his ass by 10 seconds.

04:54.680 --> 04:58.200
Just, I had never actually played the game when I played him, and

04:58.200 --> 05:01.320
I mean, he's not that much. I mean, he's a gamer, but

05:01.320 --> 05:05.240
he's probably just not as hardcore as I am, so.

05:05.240 --> 05:09.480
Oh well. And then, Luminous is

05:09.480 --> 05:13.120
interesting. It's like, so simple, but you can kinda

05:13.120 --> 05:18.820
screw yourself up pretty easy on it. So, it's interesting. It's just something you gotta play, I guess.

05:18.820 --> 05:22.820
And then I also put Robot Chicken, five episodes of it, on my PSP.

05:22.820 --> 05:25.120
Doing the hacksaw thing? Elite hacksawing?

05:25.120 --> 05:29.120
Not really. I mean, it's a feature of the PSP. They put video on it. So, that's what I did.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.120
Alright.

05:30.120 --> 05:37.120
Um, you know, my gaming week was kind of similar, where, um, I actually played Donkey Konga this week over at, uh, my buddy's house.

05:37.120 --> 05:41.620
We were playing Donkey Konga, and I haven't played Donkey Konga a whole lot. Like, maybe this is like my second or third time playing it.

05:41.620 --> 05:47.300
But I was playing all the crazy songs. It's kind of like how Loki was kicking ass at Ridge Racer his first time playing it

05:47.300 --> 05:53.580
Just because I've played so many of the rhythm beat games and since I'd played Taiko no Tatujin before which is Taiko drum master

05:53.580 --> 05:57.460
Which is basically the same thing as Donkey Konga just in a different setup

05:57.460 --> 06:02.540
I had no problem clearing the difficult song so they were going like how are you doing that you second time playing?

06:02.540 --> 06:04.540
Oh my god. What's wrong?

06:05.240 --> 06:11.020
Also during my gaming week. I also played a little bit of luminous which wow that game is just it really is

06:11.020 --> 06:16.120
this amazing as everybody says it is so addicting it's seizure inducing at times

06:16.120 --> 06:20.360
but once you get the hang of it there are some very good I would highly

06:20.360 --> 06:26.520
recommend over on game facts calm game faqs calm they have some luminous facts

06:26.520 --> 06:29.980
and you wouldn't think that a puzzle game would need it but when you read it

06:29.980 --> 06:33.800
it really improved my game I was not able to get past the second skin but

06:33.800 --> 06:39.280
then when I read the FAQs I was up to like skin number 10 on my next game so I

06:39.280 --> 06:42.880
I highly recommend checking that out and I have not been able to get the song shining out of my head

06:42.880 --> 06:47.560
That's the song that plays in the first stage the mono groso song you beat shiny

06:48.360 --> 06:53.760
The songs are addicting you get stuck in your head. So big props to luminous and of course Final Fantasy 11

06:53.760 --> 06:56.840
I've been getting sucked back into that. What can I say? I'm an addict

06:57.960 --> 07:01.920
Alright, let's get into some gaming news. Did you you had another thought a minute ago Dark Sakura?

07:01.920 --> 07:04.840
I want to make sure if I did I forgot what it was. No biggie

07:04.840 --> 07:09.680
Speaking of leaked hack-soring of the PSP, we're going to start off tonight with a story

07:09.680 --> 07:11.960
on the PSP.

07:11.960 --> 07:17.600
This is posted on psphacks.blogspot.com.

07:17.600 --> 07:24.520
It's the PSP Home Control Version 1.0, and it's actually a way that you can control your

07:24.520 --> 07:28.420
DVD player, TiVo, and high-definition television, all from your PSP.

07:28.420 --> 07:30.400
It's what some guy did.

07:30.400 --> 07:34.120
He made graphics in Photoshop and everything crazy.

07:34.120 --> 07:39.220
actually controlling devices using his PSP not something for everybody of

07:39.220 --> 07:42.380
course it's using the wipeout hacks to be able to do this not something for

07:42.380 --> 07:47.900
everybody but certainly shows the potential the PSP has as a device if it

07:47.900 --> 07:50.740
can do this with a little bit of tweaking it's only a matter of time

07:50.740 --> 07:53.420
before some of these features come into the mainstream so this is kind of neat

07:53.420 --> 07:57.100
one of the things that's actually pretty cool that's coming out later on is a

07:57.100 --> 08:01.500
game where you can actually make your own game sort of the memory cards and

08:01.500 --> 08:03.900
and then probably upload it to the internet and all that wonderful stuff.

08:03.900 --> 08:07.300
Oh, that's going to unleash a whole other community upon itself.

08:07.300 --> 08:08.100
That's going to be interesting.

08:08.100 --> 08:10.100
Like the RPG makers or fighter makers?

08:10.100 --> 08:12.100
Or ZZT if you want to get really old school.

08:12.100 --> 08:14.100
But... oh my god.

08:14.100 --> 08:16.100
Port that to the...

08:16.100 --> 08:20.700
Oh, please somebody stop porting Linux and start porting ZZT.

08:20.700 --> 08:21.200
Why the hell...

08:21.200 --> 08:25.700
If you have any idea what I'm talking about, please port ZZT to the PSP.

08:25.700 --> 08:26.700
Too many acronyms, I know.

08:26.700 --> 08:29.700
Eh, put Linux on your toaster.

08:29.700 --> 08:34.700
Anyway, if you want to check that out again, it's psphacks, all one word,.blogspot.com.

08:34.700 --> 08:37.700
Moving on, Halo 2 is going to be getting a big update this week.

08:37.700 --> 08:42.700
This Monday, Bungie's putting out a brand new patch for Halo 2.

08:42.700 --> 08:46.700
This is going to be pretty big because they're actually going to alter the way some of the weapons work.

08:46.700 --> 08:49.700
They're going to be doing some changes with the melee damage,

08:49.700 --> 08:52.700
they're going to be changing the way grenades work a little bit,

08:52.700 --> 08:54.700
the fuse timer's going to be tightened up a little bit,

08:54.700 --> 08:57.700
and the damage caused is going to be increased.

08:57.700 --> 09:01.540
they're just changing some other things here and there there's a whole FAQ

09:01.540 --> 09:04.700
available in the news section at Bungie.net but of course you will be

09:04.700 --> 09:09.660
forced to auto update on Monday when this patch rolls out what else I think

09:09.660 --> 09:14.060
is kind of interesting about this is in the FAQs it actually says that they will

09:14.060 --> 09:19.340
be resetting the leaderboards when this auto update is rolled out and the reason

09:19.340 --> 09:22.860
why they're saying they're doing this too many hacks out there right now too

09:22.860 --> 09:27.540
many people taking abuse of the glitches that are on there right now the default

09:27.540 --> 09:31.420
the leaderboards kind of one it's one aspect is a pretty big answer here I'd

09:31.420 --> 09:36.220
urge you guys to check it out if you're a halo fan over at bungee net but

09:36.220 --> 09:39.380
they're basically gonna reset to kind of give everyone a fair shot since they are

09:39.380 --> 09:43.060
tweaking the rules although they say to the casual player which would be me I

09:43.060 --> 09:46.760
think I fall in this category because I suck at halo you won't even notice the

09:46.760 --> 09:49.860
difference something the hardcore players are gonna notice the difference

09:49.860 --> 09:54.840
in I bet neither of you care because you don't play halo at all do you halo makes

09:54.840 --> 10:00.060
me throw up. I like Halo. I like Halo, but it makes me motion sick. Ah, so it's not,

10:00.060 --> 10:03.820
you don't throw up because you hate the game. I literally get so motion sick that I would

10:03.820 --> 10:08.440
like to, you know, remove the contents of my lunch from my stomach and offer it to the

10:08.440 --> 10:15.440
porcelain goddess on my knees. Loki, you're just not, eh, eh. I mean, I don't own the

10:16.220 --> 10:22.700
game, I don't own Xbox. Yay. Alright, then let's talk about a story I do know you would

10:22.700 --> 10:24.020
know something about Loki.

10:24.020 --> 10:26.640
Final Fantasy XI had some news this week

10:26.640 --> 10:29.300
because they are under attack.

10:29.300 --> 10:31.820
Somebody is DDoSing them.

10:31.820 --> 10:35.260
This is also known as the denial of service attacks

10:35.260 --> 10:37.660
where basically somebody is trying to overload

10:37.660 --> 10:38.880
the servers with information

10:38.880 --> 10:40.780
so that they effectively shut down.

10:40.780 --> 10:42.220
And I can personally attest to this.

10:42.220 --> 10:43.740
I had problems logging in on,

10:43.740 --> 10:44.860
I think it was like Tuesday night,

10:44.860 --> 10:45.920
I was trying to log in.

10:45.920 --> 10:47.700
Remember, you were playing and I was gonna try

10:47.700 --> 10:49.620
to join you in a party, Loki.

10:49.620 --> 10:50.780
I couldn't get in, this is why.

10:50.780 --> 10:53.000
somebody who was DDOSing the servers.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.840
Squeenix, as we fondly refer to them here on this show,

10:56.840 --> 10:59.100
they're putting the smack down.

10:59.100 --> 11:00.600
They're saying that they have notified

11:00.600 --> 11:02.680
law enforcement authorities in Japan,

11:02.680 --> 11:04.720
the United States, and Europe.

11:04.720 --> 11:06.440
The attack started April 9th,

11:06.440 --> 11:08.040
and as of the taping of this podcast,

11:08.040 --> 11:10.280
they're still ongoing as far as we know,

11:10.280 --> 11:12.620
causing latency and screwy servers.

11:12.620 --> 11:15.040
So they're not happy about that, and...

11:15.040 --> 11:17.200
Is this just some World of Warcraft person

11:17.200 --> 11:19.480
that's just pissed off or something?

11:19.480 --> 11:20.320
Who would do this?

11:20.320 --> 11:22.520
people that got banned for selling Gil on eBay.

11:22.520 --> 11:23.820
Yeah, I was gonna say, who would do this?

11:23.820 --> 11:26.520
Who would have the motive to DDoS Final Fantasy 11?

11:26.520 --> 11:29.360
Because honestly, how many servers are there

11:29.360 --> 11:30.200
for Final Fantasy 11?

11:30.200 --> 11:31.960
There's like at least 20.

11:31.960 --> 11:33.760
You're not gonna shut the whole game down.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.720
You would have to have the entire force of America Online

11:36.720 --> 11:39.160
DDoSing these people to shut it down.

11:39.160 --> 11:40.040
That's not gonna happen.

11:40.040 --> 11:42.640
So what do people have to gain from this, you think?

11:42.640 --> 11:44.440
And also each server's just,

11:44.440 --> 11:46.840
it's server's not necessarily one computer either.

11:46.840 --> 11:47.760
It's true.

11:47.760 --> 11:50.000
It's like a cluster of them, so.

11:50.000 --> 11:55.400
It's that's why that's why you'll see like a group of people drop and not everybody kind of like

11:56.000 --> 12:03.920
IRC type of thing what do you think this is disgruntled gill seller world of warcraft fan base or kid that's trying to like I don't know

12:06.200 --> 12:11.620
Rose online well stop screwing up my game. That's what I have to say um

12:12.960 --> 12:14.360
moving on

12:14.360 --> 12:19.600
Kind of along the same lines as halo. We were talking about a minute ago another first-person shooter

12:19.600 --> 12:24.180
that's insanely popular Doom 3 they're making a movie out of the Doom

12:24.180 --> 12:27.920
franchise but it got pushed back it's not coming out in June after all it's

12:27.920 --> 12:32.680
actually being pushed back to October 21st is it gonna bite as much as House

12:32.680 --> 12:37.280
of the Dead I hope not it's coming out October 21st from Universal Pictures

12:37.280 --> 12:44.120
it's not being directed by Uwe Boll so this movie has a shot but it's starring

12:44.120 --> 12:49.380
The Rock yes it is starring The Rock that's cool and Carl Urban who is in

12:49.380 --> 12:54.220
Lord of the Rings, Return of the King, and Bourne's Supremacy. The director of this movie,

12:54.220 --> 12:59.340
Andruge Bartekwek, I hope I, I know I totally mispronounced that, so I apologize, but he

12:59.340 --> 13:03.940
directed the movies Cradle to the Grave and Exit Wounds. So, it should be interesting.

13:03.940 --> 13:08.300
Oh, God. We, like, have, like, some, you know, we're, we're the hip-hop artists in this movie.

13:08.300 --> 13:12.460
Yeah, I was gonna say, didn't both those, didn't both those movies star, like, hip-hop

13:12.460 --> 13:17.100
stars? I know one of them, Star 50 Cent, yeah. We're getting thug-doomed, that's it. And

13:17.100 --> 13:20.280
then they're gonna be like having you know like some hip-hop interlude action

13:20.280 --> 13:27.000
sequence or something like that do me oh um this is cool if you're into art

13:27.000 --> 13:30.760
modern art especially and gaming and I know you're this is one that might hit

13:30.760 --> 13:36.080
home for you dark Sakura they're gonna be doing an 8-bit art exhibit it's gonna

13:36.080 --> 13:41.280
open April 19th that's this week on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood it's a

13:41.280 --> 13:48.760
Gallery 1988 and the expo is running April 19th through May 20th and that is

13:48.760 --> 13:53.960
perfectly timed up so that's running through the last day of e3 very cool yes

13:53.960 --> 13:58.640
and so basically they're gonna be hosting a party for e3 attendees as well

13:58.640 --> 14:04.640
on May 18th it's game related art from more than a hundred artists the gallery

14:04.640 --> 14:11.200
is called I am 8-bit I bet there's got to be some Amano art there this is what's

14:11.200 --> 14:19.000
about it. The opening will be hosted by Gerardo, also known as Rico Suave.

14:19.000 --> 14:26.080
I find it very funny because he wasn't using that as a name at all. It means rich and smooth.

14:26.080 --> 14:32.160
Bartended by the Suicide Girls, which is one of those burlesque groups. Also, 8-Bit Weapon.

14:32.160 --> 14:33.720
Cool, I like 8-Bit Weapon.

14:33.720 --> 14:34.960
We saw those guys at Classic Gaming Airspoke.

14:34.960 --> 14:38.000
I bought one of their albums and played a marathon on my show.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
They're going to be there.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.760
So check that out.

14:40.760 --> 14:44.920
The art will be based on games Pac-Man, Street Fighter II, Dig Dug.

14:44.920 --> 14:48.000
They've got digital prints, paintings, sculpture.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.800
This is going to be just awesome.

14:49.800 --> 14:56.480
Let's see, one of the exhibits will be The Mourning of the Princess by Ryan Bubniss and

14:56.480 --> 15:02.800
it depicts an unshaven chain smoking Link from The Legend of Zelda.

15:02.800 --> 15:09.120
Tim Tomkinson made an artwork called Duck Hunter S. Thompson, which will feature the

15:09.120 --> 15:13.040
author Hunter S. Thompson, who made Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, wrote that original

15:13.040 --> 15:18.260
story, over a backdrop of the NES light gun classic.

15:18.260 --> 15:19.260
Very interesting.

15:19.260 --> 15:22.800
I am actually, I want to check this out when I'm down in LA for E3.

15:22.800 --> 15:23.800
Definitely have to.

15:23.800 --> 15:25.320
Yeah, we gotta plan a trip to that.

15:25.320 --> 15:26.320
That's gonna be cool.

15:26.320 --> 15:31.320
All right, speaking of E3, Ubisoft has revealed some of the titles they are going to be showing

15:31.320 --> 15:36.300

16:42.040 --> 16:44.040
We're just gonna be like yeah

16:47.520 --> 16:53.040
You know like we're gonna do a a cool like shooter blah blah blah blah and then do nothing with it

16:53.040 --> 16:59.540
I just want to see more original games like Katamari Damacy. I just want to see original stuff

17:00.360 --> 17:03.960
Use this fancy new next-gen technology. You're developing to make something new

17:04.720 --> 17:06.160
games

17:06.160 --> 17:12.980
Treasure games are pirate hunting. No treasure brought us. Oh our heroes. Oh the company treasure million twist

17:13.800 --> 17:15.800
They freaking brought us

17:16.120 --> 17:18.120
silhouette Mirage

17:18.120 --> 17:22.120
We need more treasure games, because treasure is awesome.

17:22.120 --> 17:25.120
Or as my friend says, Treshar.

17:25.120 --> 17:28.120
Well, do you know what gaming company is cool?

17:28.120 --> 17:30.120
At least according to themselves.

17:30.120 --> 17:36.120
Majesco, creators of the game Phantom Dust on Xbox, among other things.

17:36.120 --> 17:39.120
They are changing their NASDAQ stock symbol.

17:39.120 --> 17:40.120
This would be the stock exchange.

17:40.120 --> 17:46.120
They're changing it from MJES to COOL.

17:46.120 --> 17:47.120
Oh, funny.

17:47.120 --> 17:55.480
funny. So Majesco just wants everybody to know, they're cool. Aren't they special? I

17:55.480 --> 18:00.640
think that's kind of interesting. They're not as cool as Namco! Or several other gaming

18:00.640 --> 18:06.520
companies I can think of. One of them being Konami, one of our favorites. Konami just

18:06.520 --> 18:12.960
picked up another gaming publisher, Hudson Soft Konami has picked up. Bomberman! Yep,

18:12.960 --> 18:16.400
the makers of Bomberman, the games with the B's.

18:16.400 --> 18:17.960
You may also know Hudson Soft as,

18:17.960 --> 18:20.320
they made what, Adventure Island back in the day?

18:20.320 --> 18:21.160
Yeah.

18:21.160 --> 18:22.160
I'm not sure what they've done recently

18:22.160 --> 18:24.400
outside of Bomberman, I have to admit.

18:24.400 --> 18:27.360
But Konami and Hudson, they issued a joint statement

18:27.360 --> 18:29.880
saying that the April 27th,

18:29.880 --> 18:32.120
Konami is going to purchase three million shares

18:32.120 --> 18:35.720
of Hudson's stock, this means that Konami

18:35.720 --> 18:38.080
will become the majority stakeholder.

18:38.080 --> 18:41.800
So they're not quite fusing, per se, but.

18:41.800 --> 18:42.640
It's a takeover.

18:42.640 --> 18:48.560
but pretty much you know it's heading in that direction all right orange lounge

18:48.560 --> 18:52.440
radio we're not just here to fill you in on the latest and greatest in gaming

18:52.440 --> 18:57.480
news but we're also here to better your life because you know if all we did is

18:57.480 --> 19:02.920
played video games all day we wouldn't have any time to go out and you know get

19:02.920 --> 19:09.520
some culture see art shows so so we encourage you to get out once in a while

19:09.520 --> 19:15.280
and to help you do that Dark Sakura brings you her advice column every

19:15.280 --> 19:19.840
single week and Dark Sakura what are you gonna be talking about tonight how to

19:19.840 --> 19:27.460
navigate a minefield number one keep your eyes on your feet to freeze do not

19:27.460 --> 19:33.880
move any farther three look for spikes detonators wires bumps or discoloration

19:33.880 --> 19:38.660
in the ground around you four avoid wires bumps or discoloration on the

19:38.660 --> 19:45.200
and back up slowly in your own footsteps do not turn around walk backwards but

19:45.200 --> 19:49.800
you know what I always say in situations like that what don't freakin go to

19:49.800 --> 19:57.620
Eastern Europe avoid those minefields all together indeed all right moving on

19:57.620 --> 20:00.680
in gaming news you know there's a big movie coming out this summer the

20:00.680 --> 20:04.340
Fantastic Four they're adapting that comic book you a fan of the Fantastic

20:04.340 --> 20:07.740
Four I was at one time yeah I was like I remember the Fantastic Four like in the

20:07.740 --> 20:13.200
80s last movie that came out well Activision is actually making a

20:13.200 --> 20:18.760
Fantastic Four game and they've actually been recruiting some musicians to be on

20:18.760 --> 20:23.200
the soundtrack we're gonna have the explosion with a song called I'm on fire

20:23.200 --> 20:26.720
this is not the soundtrack to the movie this is the soundtrack to the game okay

20:26.720 --> 20:32.400
Jurassic five with a song called clobber in time go Betty go it's an all-girl punk

20:32.400 --> 20:36.800
rock band if you don't know who they are everywhere and mod rockers taking back

20:36.800 --> 20:44.220
Sunday will be bringing up error operator now the interesting thing is is that the songs all kind of go with one of the

20:44.220 --> 20:50.140
Characters error operator for mr. Fantastic the girl punk rock group everywhere for the invisible woman

20:50.640 --> 20:56.040
Jurassic five doing the song for the thing and I'm on fire of course the human torch

20:57.440 --> 21:02.020
You know clobbering time not be for the thing. I don't know. I don't know

21:02.020 --> 21:06.160
that's his catchphrase so that's just kind of cool that they've got like

21:06.160 --> 21:10.540
little songs to go with each character that's that's just cute there's really

21:10.540 --> 21:16.060
no other way I can describe that I'm sorry Pac-Man's coming back Pac-Man is

21:16.060 --> 21:19.460
going to be on the DS it seems like we get a new Pac-Man game of some type

21:19.460 --> 21:22.880
every year just something crazy this is actually not the pack picks game though

21:22.880 --> 21:26.180
this is something different it's called pack enroll and it's coming out on the

21:26.180 --> 21:29.220
DS so I for one I'm impressed that there's actually a new game coming out

21:29.220 --> 21:33.540
DS. Is this that one that I was crazy about at the E3 demo? No, that was the PacPix one.

21:33.540 --> 21:37.260
This is a little bit different. This is Pac and Roll. And what Pac and Roll does is that

21:37.260 --> 21:42.660
you basically, you play a rounded Pac-Man and you go around colorful worlds. You use

21:42.660 --> 21:48.020
the DS touch screen and stylus. So it's kind of like you're running Pac-Man through 3D

21:48.020 --> 21:52.860
worlds. So that's kind of neat. So Pac and Roll will be using, of course, the stylus.

21:52.860 --> 21:56.180
You kind of roll it around there with that. This was kind of like the trackball thing.

21:56.180 --> 21:58.900
That's the one I was wanting. Oh, was it? Oh, I thought you were talking about the one

21:58.900 --> 22:04.340
you actually draw the pac-man oh my bad all about the marble madness looking game

22:04.340 --> 22:08.820
now when you went and saw the DS at e3 did you get to go remember e3 last year

22:08.820 --> 22:12.900
they had the cool line like random people got to go in the cool line that

22:12.900 --> 22:15.960
would see like all the games and some people got to go in the not so cool line

22:15.960 --> 22:20.020
where they only saw like WarioWare that was the one I ended up being in oh you

22:20.020 --> 22:23.540
snuck over so that's how you saw this because I didn't see this I saw the pack

22:23.540 --> 22:33.200
picks though. And I also saw a picture that someone snuck. Ooh, scandalous. Alright, very

22:33.200 --> 22:38.320
interesting. Pac and Roll will include the original Pac-Man arcade game, just, you know,

22:38.320 --> 22:42.000
for the heck of it. Because, you know, just like Linux, Pac-Man has to show up on every

22:42.000 --> 22:49.860
system available out there. Indeed. What can you say? It's the granddaddy of video games.

22:49.860 --> 22:50.860
One of the grand daddies.

22:50.860 --> 22:55.080
Or just the Gradius game that we saw at friggin' E3 last year for the DS.

22:55.080 --> 22:56.080
That's what I wanna know.

22:56.080 --> 22:57.220
Seriously, I wanna see that too.

22:57.220 --> 22:58.720
You know what we need?

22:58.720 --> 23:01.260
What the whole Gradius series needs?

23:01.260 --> 23:02.260
A new Parodius.

23:02.260 --> 23:04.820
Oh, that'd be great.

23:04.820 --> 23:06.780
Or like, KO Flying Squadron 2.

23:06.780 --> 23:08.520
Actually, there was one.

23:08.520 --> 23:10.700
We need, like, a new KO Flying Squadron.

23:10.700 --> 23:13.440
Or a new Cotton Game.

23:13.440 --> 23:18.100
We have some news tonight, lastly, about the, actually, no, not lastly, almost lastly, uh,

23:18.100 --> 23:23.940
next-gen Xbox a couple stories here one of these stories has to do with Tetsuya

23:23.940 --> 23:31.100
Mitsugishi okay he's the guy who helped out with Space Channel five and rez okay

23:31.100 --> 23:35.300
he didn't just tell Bob he actually produced these games so he actually

23:35.300 --> 23:39.620
announced recently that he's gonna be doing games for the next-gen Xbox but

23:39.620 --> 23:44.300
here's the thing they will not be music-oriented titles that's a big title

23:44.300 --> 23:46.540
coming out this week that's kind of a surprise when you consider the Space

23:46.540 --> 23:52.860
channel 5 and rez are right there probably the two most underrated music

23:52.860 --> 23:57.300
titles of all time rez had the vibrator thingy rez he's going trans vibrator all

23:57.300 --> 24:04.060
the way so hopefully whatever he does will be with the vibration still huh he

24:04.060 --> 24:08.020
has commented in a recent interview that he sees the next generation consoles not

24:08.020 --> 24:13.220
just new machines but as the point of a major shift in gaming history he says I

24:13.220 --> 24:17.220
believe that we are at a historical turning point in gaming we were to look

24:17.220 --> 24:19.940
back at today in the not-too-distant future I believe that we will be saying

24:19.940 --> 24:24.260
to ourselves ah so that was the first step that led to the major major changes

24:24.260 --> 24:31.660
this time the Xbox will fit not four but six family members inside of it now you

24:31.660 --> 24:38.100
have you been following the what's that called that Xbox paying the online ARG

24:38.100 --> 24:41.900
yes ARG in it reality yeah have you been following that at all the colony is that

24:41.900 --> 24:46.460
what they're calling it? Yeah, the colony.net or something like that. Yeah, I have this

24:46.460 --> 24:53.960
wonderful web board that I read called nonfiction.com. They do all the work for me, and I just watch

24:53.960 --> 24:58.940
it from afar, kind of like what I did with Metacortex. I watched it from afar, and that's

24:58.940 --> 25:05.060
what I'm doing now. So they showed, what was it, first we found out that the official name

25:05.060 --> 25:09.960
for it is going to be the Xbox 360, that it has a really retarded looking white controller

25:09.960 --> 25:14.240
for it that's all like shiny and it's got some stupid ball on it looks like a

25:14.240 --> 25:19.040
trackball it's pure and virginal yeah whatever anyways and then also the

25:19.040 --> 25:24.600
console systems rumored to look like one of those stupid like pillows that you

25:24.600 --> 25:29.240
would use for your head if you've got bad neck support because it's like it's

25:29.240 --> 25:33.880
some it looks really ugly and that's just the rumor right now it's just a

25:33.880 --> 25:38.840
rumor but I have a bad feeling it's gonna look like a really rejected how

25:38.840 --> 25:41.040
How much you wanna bet they just took the Phantom?

25:41.040 --> 25:45.520
The Phantom's like, hmm, you know we need to get rid of these console systems, the Xbox

25:45.520 --> 25:49.440
is like, hey, we can stick our Xbox inside of those things, and boom, there you go.

25:49.440 --> 25:51.520
I'm still getting email for the Phantom.

25:51.520 --> 25:52.520
Whatever happened to the Phantom?

25:52.520 --> 25:53.520
I thought the Phantom was supposed to be out by now.

25:53.520 --> 25:54.520
I'm still getting email for them.

25:54.520 --> 25:55.520
Oh, it's coming out.

25:55.520 --> 25:57.560
And you know what this title game's gonna be?

25:57.560 --> 25:58.560
Duke Nukem Forever.

25:58.560 --> 25:59.560
No, just kidding.

25:59.560 --> 26:00.560
Oh, it's a joke.

26:00.560 --> 26:01.560
Oh, I get it.

26:01.560 --> 26:02.560
It was a funny joke.

26:02.560 --> 26:05.560
Because they're both never gonna ever come out, ever.

26:05.560 --> 26:07.560
Yeah, I get it, I get it.

26:07.560 --> 26:15.120
speaking of the Xbox 360s analysts are saying three million Xboxes could

26:15.120 --> 26:18.760
possibly be shipped by Christmas especially if the system is targeted

26:18.760 --> 26:22.760
under $300 which is where they are targeting this new system to be out will

26:22.760 --> 26:28.440
be priced around $249 to $299 they're also saying that the system will be out

26:28.440 --> 26:33.500
October or November and they're analyzing their three million this is

26:33.500 --> 26:37.180
coming from Goldman Sachs investment firm.

26:37.180 --> 26:39.140
I have a big problem with this system.

26:39.140 --> 26:40.260
Why is that?

26:40.260 --> 26:42.820
They're rumored talking about portable hard drive

26:42.820 --> 26:46.120
for it to kind of be like a sort of an MP3 player type thing.

26:46.120 --> 26:47.500
I don't like that one bit.

26:47.500 --> 26:51.220
I mean, I buy an Xbox system for gaming.

26:51.220 --> 26:52.880
I don't buy it for a media player.

26:52.880 --> 26:55.380
I don't buy it for all this crap.

26:55.380 --> 26:57.840
There's going to be a lot of gimmicky things with this kind

26:57.840 --> 26:58.340
of stuff.

26:58.340 --> 27:01.020
It's like really how many media players.

27:01.020 --> 27:01.520
I don't know.

27:01.520 --> 27:04.400
I sort of see the Xbox as more of a hardcore console system

27:04.400 --> 27:06.520
and where people that would have an Xbox

27:06.520 --> 27:11.520
would have these like an iPod or a media type thing.

27:12.440 --> 27:15.480
I don't really see, it's gonna be very gimmicky

27:15.480 --> 27:17.960
and I think they've made a lot of bad decisions with this.

27:17.960 --> 27:19.360
But we'll see, we'll see.

27:19.360 --> 27:20.200
And we don't know yet,

27:20.200 --> 27:22.580
we only have rumors to go off of right now.

27:22.580 --> 27:25.360
All right, if you have any opinions or thoughts, feedback,

27:25.360 --> 27:29.880
send us an email to go at orangeloungeradio.com.

27:29.880 --> 27:31.440
You've been checking that email over there?

27:31.440 --> 27:32.440
I have.

27:32.440 --> 27:34.240
I've been chatting with a couple of people.

27:34.240 --> 27:36.240
Heard from anybody interesting?

27:36.240 --> 27:40.840
There's one of our UK listeners, his name is Matthew.

27:40.840 --> 27:41.840
Right on.

27:41.840 --> 27:42.840
He'd like to say hi.

27:42.840 --> 27:51.480
He actually was interested in our PSP commentary, although the PSP isn't really out there yet.

27:51.480 --> 27:52.480
Okay.

27:52.480 --> 27:53.480
So that's cool.

27:53.480 --> 27:56.800
We'll try to keep making mentions on progress in the UK.

27:56.800 --> 28:02.000
Well you know one of my full side projects I'm still working on is some sort of PSP integration

28:02.000 --> 28:08.880
for our website eventually. I'm working on it. I have to get my internet up and stuff.

28:08.880 --> 28:11.680
Sounds good. By the way, speaking of Orange Launch Radio and our website,

28:11.680 --> 28:15.440
we did mention on the show tonight, we've had this theme going on of,

28:15.440 --> 28:19.520
we are starting over. May 1st is going to bring a lot of changes to OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

28:19.520 --> 28:23.600
This podcast really isn't going to be changing so much, but our 24 hour,

28:23.600 --> 28:27.440
seven-day weeks live streaming station we have on life 365 is going to be

28:27.440 --> 28:31.480
changing a little bit for the better we think gonna be more of a broad gaming so

28:31.480 --> 28:37.440
those you guys listen this podcast have something to look forward to anyway one

28:37.440 --> 28:42.680
more story here tonight this is interesting here games could possibly

28:42.680 --> 28:48.080
soon be losing their voice online trade magazines are stating that the

28:48.080 --> 28:53.080
negotiations between the Screen Actors Guild and game publishers to renew voice

28:53.080 --> 28:58.440
acting contracts are kind of on the bubble right now so this could possibly

28:58.440 --> 29:04.480
lead to a future strike who knows well how could this affect things well let's

29:04.480 --> 29:09.260
look at this Charlize Theron what is lending her voice to Majesco's a on flux

29:09.260 --> 29:14.800
David Duchovny Marilyn Manson are doing voices in Midway's area 51 Sean Connery

29:14.800 --> 29:19.320
is doing some voice acting for from Russia with love from EA very cool

29:19.320 --> 29:24.680
Marlon Brando did some voice acting as you may remember for the Godfather game

29:24.680 --> 29:31.880
before it came out very interesting variety.com making this report hmm so who

29:31.880 --> 29:35.800
knows would you be all torn up if actors famous actors had to leave video games

29:35.800 --> 29:41.560
to me it the type of games I play it doesn't really matter to me sometimes

29:41.560 --> 29:45.960
though they make the game sometimes you know like the Buffy game you know how

29:45.960 --> 29:51.360
crazy I was over that. They had everybody except Sir Michelle Geller. That just sort

29:51.360 --> 29:53.680
of axed it for me.

29:53.680 --> 29:58.860
Aw. I know, but look at a game like Final Fantasy X. I mean, some pretty decent voice

29:58.860 --> 30:04.320
acting in that game from basically folks who, maybe they're big on the anime dubbing, but

30:04.320 --> 30:08.060
no screen actors really in that group, and they're all pretty good.

30:08.060 --> 30:11.820
But the thing is, is that for The Godfather, you expect Marlon Brando.

30:11.820 --> 30:12.960
That is, okay, that is true.

30:12.960 --> 30:17.040
For Bond, you expect Sean Connery, especially since he's playing Bond in the new movie.

30:17.040 --> 30:19.360
Because it's supposed to be an older Bond.

30:19.360 --> 30:20.360
Interesting.

30:20.360 --> 30:21.360
I haven't heard that one.

30:21.360 --> 30:22.360
Yeah.

30:22.360 --> 30:23.360
That's a stretch.

30:23.360 --> 30:24.360
I don't think so.

30:24.360 --> 30:25.360
I don't know about that.

30:25.360 --> 30:26.360
I don't know where you heard that one.

30:26.360 --> 30:27.360
Uh, Premiere Magazine.

30:27.360 --> 30:28.360
Hmm.

30:28.360 --> 30:29.360
Sounds like a rumor to me.

30:29.360 --> 30:30.360
Sounds like a rumor to me.

30:30.360 --> 30:31.360
We'll see.

30:31.360 --> 30:32.360
I've heard something completely different.

30:32.360 --> 30:35.120
It's based off of one of the original Bond novels that featured him as a retiree.

30:35.120 --> 30:37.900
That I heard, but I heard like Pierce Brosnan was coming back and then I heard they got

30:37.900 --> 30:39.160
some new guy.

30:39.160 --> 30:41.320
We won't know anything until they release the official press release.

30:41.320 --> 30:42.320
It's all speculation.

30:42.320 --> 30:43.320
Who cares?

30:43.320 --> 30:47.000
Because it's Sean Connery, he could be a quadruple amputee and still be hot.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.840
You know, he should go back to doing Bond movies.

30:48.840 --> 30:49.840
What else has he done lately?

30:49.840 --> 30:50.840
He did the, uh...

30:50.840 --> 30:51.840
The Avengers?

30:51.840 --> 30:52.840
Yeah.

30:52.840 --> 30:53.840
Hey, the Avengers had Eddie Izzard in it.

30:53.840 --> 30:54.840
What was the other one?

30:54.840 --> 30:55.840
The, uh, uh...

30:55.840 --> 30:56.840
League of Extraordinary Gentlemen?

30:56.840 --> 30:57.840
No, thank you.

30:57.840 --> 30:59.000
I needed to see that.

30:59.000 --> 31:03.160
How about they just have the wonderful movie Sean Connery Kicks Ass, and that's, that's

31:03.160 --> 31:04.160
what it is.

31:04.160 --> 31:07.960
It's just him punching one person after another, you know, the end.

31:07.960 --> 31:12.160
Alright, before we turn into movie chat, I think it's time to end Orange Lounge Radio

31:12.160 --> 31:13.160
for this week.

31:13.160 --> 31:14.760
We'll be back next week, though.

31:14.760 --> 31:16.580
Final thoughts, Loki?

31:16.580 --> 31:21.200
I hate moving.

31:21.200 --> 31:22.560
Dark Sakura?

31:22.560 --> 31:24.420
Reject false icons.

31:24.420 --> 31:25.420
My final thought?

31:25.420 --> 31:28.280
I've got so much laundry to do.

31:28.280 --> 31:29.280
Thanks for listening, everybody.

31:29.280 --> 31:33.320
We'll see you next time on the Orange Lounge Radio To-Go Edition.

31:33.320 --> 31:37.080
