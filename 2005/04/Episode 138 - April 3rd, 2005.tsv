299791	308334	Also in this corner, say hello to our tech massa slash the official, I'm giving him a new title tonight, the official Orange Lounge pirate.
308834	309194	Arrrr!
309994	310294	Loki.
310954	311835	Why am I a pirate?
312215	312695	Arrrr!
312835	314395	I don't know, because you do pirate-like things.
314415	316816	Because you're always chasing the booty, that's why.
318036	318336	Okay.
319557	320217	How are you, sir?
321037	321477	I'm fine.
322638	325599	Also say hello to a regular guest, DDR Angel.
326539	326799	Hello.
328823	333684	who's feeling as angel as always, I guess, I don't know, and brought me taffy, which is awesome.
333704	336345	You want some, too?
336945	342006	Better hurry up and eat some, because I'm, like, porking through all this taffy, I'm like, food, candy, sugar, it's yummy.
342386	345846	It's okay, Magus decided to steal some last night while I went to bed anyway.
346327	353548	I'm like, okay, I'm going to bed, next thing you know, I, uh, yesterday, or, I mean, this morning, I looked in the bag, I'm like, damn it, half of it's gone!
355182	357311	That's what happens when you put taffy in front of people.
357371	359319	It disappears because taffy is yummy.
361917	364478	Anywho, we should have a heck of a show for you guys tonight.
365839	370021	We found the sound clip we wanted to play very badly for you guys last week.
370041	374364	We played it about a year ago, which is a little bit of a hint as to what it is.
374764	380007	We were talking about a little something something last week, and we finally found the sound clip of it to play tonight.
380507	381648	So it's wonderful.
381668	382548	So we're going to play it for you.
382568	384949	I hope it doesn't have me saying anything, you know.
385390	387271	No, it's actually not a sound clip of you.
388311	391373	It's a sound clip of somebody not even on this show, but that's what makes it funny.
392982	394604	We'll discuss what that is in a little bit, don't worry.
395725	396025	Okay.
396125	397086	I'll give you a hint during break.
397907	398207	Alright.
399408	401070	Speaking of break, let's get to it.
402071	404893	In this break, some random music.
404913	407756	We'll start it off with a little bit of French counting.
408297	412060	So if you want to learn how to count to three, just listen very carefully to the lyrics of the song.
412821	415323	We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
415423	415784	Enjoy!
446992	448013	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
475029	475630	Thanks for watching!
701149	702130	DarkSakura.com
761541	766125	Fly away, to fantasy, spinning round, instantly, a day will wait.
790645	806360	Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.
806460	810904	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to
812583	819828	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 138, in progress here on this lovely April night.
820628	822910	Hope you guys had an interesting April Fool's Day.
822970	826212	I know there were a lot of interesting pranks that were played out there by some various websites.
826712	833257	Of course, one of the biggest sites I'm sure most of us who listen to this program visit once in a while, the DDR Freak.
833897	834397	Thanks for watching!
855563	857604	You know, given the, why am I so loud?
857824	858185	I don't know.
858445	865349	Given the issue with last year, I just sort of sat back and let everybody else do their thing, and I was like, I'm not even gonna.
865809	874995	Seriously, like, last year was a lot, and I couldn't believe some of the response the joke was getting on DDR Freak, because people were like, oh, this is, this sucks compared to last year.
875395	876876	Last year was funny, blah, blah, blah.
877182	880103	And I'm going like, okay, last year was like too much.
880604	882805	I'm like, you cannot outdo what they did last year.
883585	886426	Because what happened last year was like over the top.
886586	893409	Last year, the best part about it was actually getting everything that led up to April Fool's Day.
893950	898972	Because we were all going, becoming power hungry, egomaniac.
899352	902053	It was basically wrestling drama.
902073	902954	Yeah.
903570	907493	Basically, it was like you all got to be WWE members for a minute.
907513	913577	We were all like, screw y'all, we are all admins and we are going to just take over the whole page.
914437	922122	And then all chaos broke loose on New Year's.
922542	924203	The new revolution, oh yeah!
924464	926345	I swear it's Daylight Savings Time if I can win my head.
927446	929487	Oh, I have a lot to say about Daylight Savings Time in a little bit.
930354	933395	But seriously though, last year was so much fun.
933435	937316	This year I'm like, nothing will ever be what last year was.
937416	939057	So I just sat back and let it happen.
939517	940517	This is your puppy.
941178	942278	You can put it in town if you want.
942318	947780	Everybody's saying that it doesn't top last year and it wasn't funny and it wasn't creative and it was too obvious.
947820	957002	But I think what people don't get is that the actual joke was not the fact that DDR Freak was going to turn into In The Groove Freak.
957042	958543	The joke was that...
959412	962633	It was something that they really were going to add to the site and keep.
963373	965513	So it was kind of like one of those not a joke jokes.
965533	966234	Got you twice.
966554	966994	Kind of.
967034	967734	I don't know how to put it.
968714	969494	I thought it was funny.
970775	973875	Now everybody knows I was a very vocal critic of last year's joke.
973995	975396	I did not enjoy last year's joke.
975436	977576	I thought it was way over the top and not necessary.
978957	980677	So I much preferred this year's joke.
981997	986058	I'll tell you what, part of the joke was getting the angry reactions.
986278	987839	That was part of the good thing.
988379	988979	No offense.
989306	989726	No, it's alright.
991827	993227	But last year's joke was stupid.
993588	996809	So I'm glad that this year's joke was a little more tame and kind of funny.
996829	997849	Good thing we didn't do anything.
997869	998569	Yeah, I know.
998609	1001090	I'm glad we decided to stay out of the April Fool's thing.
1001110	1002931	Because, you know, I don't think April Fool's is that funny at all.
1003211	1003471	No.
1003531	1004392	Yeah, exactly.
1004472	1005052	Boycott it.
1005292	1006112	Uh-huh.
1007253	1008373	So anyway, where was I?
1008553	1008833	Oh, yes.
1010974	1011595	I'm not surprised at all.
1011615	1011995	I mean, after all.
1012015	1012115	What?
1012135	1012475	No, seriously.
1012495	1013176	You've got... You have my...
1041005	1042006	Gorgeous voice.
1043026	1047689	We have our violent and angry young man here.
1048089	1049130	And then we have you.
1049790	1051711	Yeah, and then there's the gay.
1052352	1054273	Yeah, and then we have the gay.
1056074	1058776	But, I don't know, I'm not surprised at all.
1058796	1060036	We put enough work into this.
1060817	1062758	We deserve our kudos, damn it.
1064642	1068745	Well, thank you for being so humble about everything.
1068805	1069526	I appreciate it.
1069546	1070767	We are fucking celebrities.
1072168	1073569	Okay, the internet loves us.
1076651	1081294	Well, in all reality, I'm going to come down to, you know, planet Earth here.
1081334	1082395	I don't know where Jamie's at right now.
1082415	1083896	I'm going to come down to planet Earth here.
1084737	1085818	The Earth is beneath me.
1087039	1087899	I am on the moon now.
1087919	1090081	Screw you guys.
1091024	1094127	But it's just funny to see everybody that's nominated for Broadcaster of the Year.
1094147	1097249	And you've got some really freaking fantabulous stations.
1097329	1099992	Folks that are probably... I don't know this for sure.
1100032	1101053	I'm speculating here.
1101073	1107238	But I'm guessing there's at least one or two stations in there where that is what they do is like 365.
1107518	1111281	So to be nominated amongst that is like awesome.
1111942	1112943	I don't even know how to put it.
1113023	1114524	And it's our listeners who helped us get there.
1114564	1116166	So, you know, kisses to you guys.
1116406	1116786	You know what?
1116866	1118327	I have to make a mention to the chat room.
1118528	1118688	Yes.
1120040	1122562	No, we are not going to have Roberto or Jaime.
1122802	1123323	Thank you.
1123783	1124504	Yes, no.
1124744	1126486	We are not going to be in Espanol.
1126846	1128327	We will be in Esperanto.
1128707	1136094	Now, if we wanted to do the April Fool's thing, which we don't, having the station in Spanish one day would have been pretty funny.
1137415	1139076	So we've got to write these down for next year.
1140237	1146643	Which is incredibly funny because I don't speak any Spanish except for El Telefono Es En Fuego.
1148991	1150912	Which translates to, the telephone is on fire.
1152173	1153914	Donde esta el baño?
1154654	1155555	That's the only one I know.
1155795	1156675	Where is the bathroom?
1156715	1159196	Because, you know, if you're going to go visit... We should do this show in Japanese.
1159457	1161938	If you're going to go visit, like, Tijuana, that's a phrase you need to know.
1165216	1165736	All right, anyway.
1166397	1167638	Well, back to the sound clip.
1167778	1168539	I was going to play this.
1168779	1169539	Ah, screw the clip.
1169559	1179887	You might remember we were actually nominated for Best of Life 365 last year in the category of Most Unlikely to Hear on AM FM Radio, which we got nominated in again this year, which is very cool.
1180067	1182069	So there's two places to nominate us.
1182429	1185071	However, something very funny happened.
1185892	1193978	Three of us, all three of us, myself, DarkSakura, and Loki, we all went to the awards ceremony, and this is what happened when we got there.
1194932	1198053	Okay, most unlikely to hear on AM FM radio.
1198073	1199534	Is that where we are?
1199594	1200474	Yes.
1200634	1208297	Unnamed stream, fluffer tracks, Apollo 11, or Pern Pokemon Radio, P-I-R-N.
1212178	1212558	Oh, yeah.
1213118	1214499	Orange Lounge was nominated as well.
1216340	1217920	Oh, yeah.
1218020	1218620	Oh, crap.
1218840	1219281	Oh, yes.
1219601	1220281	Those guys.
1220621	1221281	Oh, damn.
1222082	1222862	What happened to that?
1225259	1227120	Yeah, this is that Orange Lounge radio crap.
1228041	1230903	Let me scrape off my shoes so we can get a nomination.
1232425	1232785	Let's see.
1233806	1237048	Okay, I can just imagine us getting ready to leave the office.
1237128	1239070	And I'm half drunk by the time they get to us.
1239850	1241532	Okay, now, you guys remembered.
1241572	1244334	We got the fluffer station, the porn station.
1244534	1245895	We got Pokemon, right?
1246435	1247756	Okay, that's all we need.
1248317	1249037	Screw Orange Lounge.
1249137	1249418	Screw them.
1250077	1255981	I plan to sit at... I plan... Okay, this is my plan for the awards ceremony.
1257122	1257522	This year?
1257982	1258422	This year.
1258442	1258923	Uh-huh.
1259643	1262045	Is sitting at the damn table with a bottle of tequila.
1262965	1264386	Doing shots through the whole thing.
1265147	1265607	Okay, now.
1266147	1267348	Listen, though, very carefully.
1267368	1268689	I'm going to play a little clip of this again.
1268749	1270010	Listen very carefully.
1270510	1275273	After they announce Pokemon Radio, which was the last one they read, they start to open the envelope.
1275333	1277815	Listen very carefully to what happens in the background.
1279432	1280933	Radio, PIRN.
1283794	1285916	You distinctly hear Loki back there going, Hey!
1287076	1287376	Hey!
1287877	1288837	No!
1288897	1289918	This doesn't fly.
1289998	1290818	Hey, lady!
1291239	1293560	I wasted a tank of gas to get here!
1295961	1297382	I'm drunk!
1298022	1299463	Say my name, bitch!
1300784	1301644	Say my name!
1303565	1306727	I think you and I were the only ones who drank.
1306787	1308148	Loki, didn't you kick back a beer or two?
1309082	1309282	No.
1309602	1309982	You were driving.
1310002	1310843	Yeah, because you had to drive.
1310883	1312784	Somebody had to be responsible.
1312884	1315625	Well, I don't know why Loki was saying hey.
1315665	1316225	He wasn't driving.
1316285	1320848	I think it had like a Sapporo, a Heineken, and Guinness.
1321348	1324029	I'm like, let's have the international alcohol today.
1327051	1328751	So then, of course, just as a reminder.
1330412	1330832	Oh, yeah.
1331353	1332733	Orange Lounge was nominated as well.
1333454	1334854	They didn't make it to the envelope.
1334894	1335475	Sorry about that.
1336775	1339742	Well, we reprinted them separately, so they might have.
1339822	1340944	I had no idea what that excuse was.
1340964	1343550	And the winner goes to Fluffertracks, Vanevich.
1344371	1347238	Yay, hooray for the porno radio station.
1349178	1350099	Hooray for them!
1350179	1351140	Okay, yeah, great.
1351420	1355463	So just as a reminder, we didn't win last year, so we'd really appreciate your vote this year.
1355623	1362269	So head on over to www.orangehoundstrater.com, and it has a link so you can go to the ballot on 9th and 65th and vote!
1362669	1364310	So I hope you all take a second to do that.
1365211	1367813	And maybe this year we will be remembered on the envelope.
1367833	1368354	This year?
1369615	1370996	We need to make a scene.
1371056	1377460	They need to realize that it is stations like us who make the money for them.
1378181	1378941	Oh, I'm sorry.
1378981	1380583	Planet Earth's down here and you're up here again.
1380603	1381303	No, seriously.
1382684	1390670	If it wasn't for us and the fact that people keep wanting to listen to us and we have to pay them more money to enable our listeners to enjoy us.
1392182	1398286	Do you think that maybe the fact that we somehow actually got nominated Broadcaster of the Year is a little bit of an apology for that last year?
1398346	1400527	Like, oh shit, we better make it up to them somehow.
1401788	1405631	They better have a table separated for us.
1407071	1408072	No, but this is a weird thing.
1408292	1409413	With rose petals.
1412055	1415177	And, like, some nice champagne.
1416537	1417178	And waffles.
1417858	1418719	Because I like waffles.
1420026	1421307	I demand waffles!
1421607	1422207	Waffle!
1423588	1424788	Here's the crazy thing.
1425489	1429871	We actually have quite a few listeners in the Bay Area where this show's award ceremony is going to take place.
1430551	1433112	A lot of people have been asking me if they can go.
1433873	1444578	We have totally, have got to carry, totally have to make up the choreography for, um, yeah, choreography for, like, something sort of like, you know, the West Side Story, just come in, just start...
1446880	1450082	Just, like, all just, like, come in and just, like, you know, prance around and shit.
1450102	1451282	That'd be fucking hilarious.
1452003	1457545	Actually, we will be taking official sign-ups on our website pretty soon for the official Orange Lounge Radio Entourage.
1457966	1471932	The folks that will be going with us to the awards show, they have to have 20 bucks, because it costs 20 bucks to go to the show, and you have to have your own way over there or something, because we don't have a big van or anything, so make sure you can find a ride to the hotel where this is going to be at, and I forget where it is.
1472213	1473853	I'll look it up later in the show and give it to you guys.
1474474	1474554	Um...
1475374	1483499	But we do need people to actually be carrying the red carpet so that when Jamie, Loki, and myself arrive, they can roll it out so we can walk on it and walk in.
1484320	1485321	That is awesome.
1485461	1487002	And it needs to be crushed velvet.
1489343	1490064	You think I'm kidding.
1491625	1493626	The sad thing is, ladies and gentlemen, she's not.
1494166	1494406	All right.
1494446	1496748	Anyway, so more to come on that a little later.
1496848	1499069	So I don't want to keep dragging this segment out.
1499109	1499490	See, I'm...
1501428	1502009	No, forget it.
1502350	1503092	I've said my piece.
1503112	1504414	You sure?
1505336	1505797	For now.
1506739	1507019	Okay.
1507039	1508142	But I'm going to return to this.
1509568	1511869	Live 365, now we know you're listening.
1512469	1512989	Yeah, we know.
1513009	1514909	You snubbed us last year.
1515390	1518550	Now that we are really huge international celebrities.
1518570	1519731	We are bigger this year.
1520331	1524672	We are bigger than... We have play on DDR Freak Radio.
1524992	1528113	I'd say we're bigger than the Pope, but that would be in very poor taste this week.
1528153	1529493	So we're not bigger than that right now.
1529753	1536174	But we're bigger than... We are bigger than Goatsey.
1536555	1537575	Yeah, we're bigger than Goatsey.
1538135	1538435	I agree.
1539936	1541037	We are bigger than big.
1541617	1547079	And so you better get out the chapstick because you're going to be kissing our ass so much this year.
1549640	1550220	Oh my God.
1550240	1557203	Do you know how many fellow broadcasters are listening to this for the first time going, what a bunch of stuck up bitches.
1557263	1558924	See if they get our vote.
1560509	1562149	Jamie really is a polite individual.
1562189	1566630	If you meet her in person, she's a big fluffy hug monster when you meet her.
1567931	1569771	I really am cute and adorable, aren't I?
1571132	1571612	Don't push it.
1572152	1576213	Seriously, I'm glad we got the nominations this year.
1576573	1577573	Yes, I'm very glad too.
1577693	1578593	I was surprised.
1578733	1580674	I'm not bitter at all about last year.
1581694	1584195	It's an excuse for me to drink more expensive alcohol.
1584455	1590076	And have a good time encouraging our fellow broadcasters to
1590802	1593244	Continue to give the finger to conventional radio.
1593344	1593784	Exactly.
1593824	1596226	That's what this is really all about, is giving the finger to conventional radio.
1596246	1603091	We're about protecting our First Amendment rights and saying, Hey, regular radio, y'all can kiss my ass.
1603171	1604332	That's right.
1604452	1610556	We want to be able to say fucking shit on the air, and we're all about our right to say whatever we want.
1610636	1613698	If we want to tell dick and fart jokes for three hours, that's what we're going to do.
1613718	1615059	That's practically what we do anyway.
1615079	1615460	I know.
1616941	1617181	Anyway.
1617281	1619863	And we've been doing this for two and a half years.
1621718	1622298	Moving on.
1623078	1629660	Let's start off tonight's show, but outside of that little rant, we usually start off the show with a little bit of, how was your week, how was your day?
1629720	1631000	So let's back up a little bit.
1631801	1633021	DarkSakura, how was your week, how was your day?
1633241	1635101	Busy as all get out.
1635281	1636042	Oh my god.
1636722	1639543	You know, the week before was spring break.
1640643	1646684	So now that spring break's over, my ass is back in having to do all this crap for school.
1647004	1649345	And my teachers have actually taken a bit of mercy on us.
1649704	1651746	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1674093	1678076	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1700479	1703541	I'm going to be coming up with a few more.
1703901	1707203	And Lemon Lime Jump, that's cool that your sister's a Marine, my little brother's a Marine too.
1709804	1717128	So, it's just really been pretty busy.
1717768	1722451	Oh yeah, I did hang out yesterday with Iguana Girl and Tia.
1723511	1726353	We went shopping, we did girly stuff all day.
1728268	1728889	Thank you for watching!
1741792	1747516	It's just, it's very frustrating right now because I'm in between sizes, so nothing I try on fits worth a damn.
1747576	1748316	I have a question.
1748396	1752959	Why is it that pant sizes for, you know, for girls, they're always like, you know, 14, 16, 18.
1753340	1756482	I'd say they're juniors.
1758583	1759904	Oh, I never knew that.
1760124	1761205	So that means I could go to Target.
1761625	1762206	This is cool.
1762326	1765008	I can actually shop in the junior section at Target now.
1766388	1769090	That makes me very happy because I can get stuff cheap now.
1770311	1771552	And I can go to thrift stores too.
1774551	1775692	Thrift store shopping is awesome.
1775732	1776712	I went to a thrift store the other day.
1776993	1777793	They had a bunch of crap.
1778674	1780075	I almost bought some vinyl pants, though.
1781235	1781796	That's awesome.
1781836	1784418	But they were cut really funny.
1785298	1787159	And then I went today.
1787740	1795645	Because of the stupid daylight savings time, my ass was up until 4 o'clock, which I was up until 5.30 on Friday, so it's all good.
1797806	1801629	And then I went out to lunch with Dan.
1802623	1804545	We found the motherlode of Atari games.
1804565	1805325	It was awesome.
1829671	1832273	Um, in fact, I've got a list here of what we found.
1832313	1847225	For anyone who is a classic gaming nut like me and my man are, um, we got, uh, the, uh, Star Trek, uh, Starfleet Academy thing that was on the Atari 2600 back in the day.
1849627	1850107	And, uh,
1851314	1856398	We also picked up Junior Pac-Man, Frogger 2, and Journey Escape.
1865859	1869783	Now, I remember the Journey video game in the arcades like back in the 80s.
1870203	1876148	It was awesome because it actually had like MIDI style Don't Stop Believin' and open arms and stuff that played in the background.
1876568	1878230	But what is Journey Escape on the Atari?
1878270	1879131	Was it the same thing?
1879371	1882193	We haven't even played it in, but it's one of the rarer Atari games.
1882233	1886757	You need to check it out because I want to know if it's just like the arcade game or if it's like a whole different adventure.
1887398	1893003	Well, I also was digging around to replace some CDs that I've since lost and
1893544	1898947	I was off looking for, actually, specifically today I was looking for Blur CDs.
1899868	1909473	But as I was walking down to the register, this tape caught my eye from the side, and it turned out to be a Gorillaz promo DVD.
1909794	1910894	Not a DVD, but a VHS.
1910974	1913656	And Gorillaz is this band you've really been getting into lately, right?
1914717	1914977	Yes.
1915457	1918959	Don't give me that look.
1918979	1920360	Let me warm up my eyes a little bit.
1921514	1925296	Oh, precious DarkSakura, what is the charm of the gorillas?
1925376	1926676	No, seriously, what is it?
1926976	1933318	Because it's like half art, half music, half fandom, which is three halves, but I don't know how it works.
1933338	1938180	Completely indescribable, just go to the website and you will be lost for hours digging through the studio.
1939821	1940101	Alright.
1942762	1946203	I don't have enough time in the show to go into it, so I won't.
1948244	1949144	Just read my live journal.
1949665	1950545	Alright, fair enough.
1951431	1953954	Speaking of LiveJournal, we have an Orange Lounge LiveJournal community.
1954014	1958099	It's www.livejournal.com slash users slash Orange Lounge.
1958199	1958640	All one word.
1958800	1959681	Nice plug.
1959882	1960362	No problem.
1960622	1963546	And I haven't really plugged our chat room tonight either, so let me give that a shout out.
1963786	1965448	www.orangeloungeradio.com.
1965769	1967972	Click on chat.
1968112	1969473	Loki, how was your week?
1969513	1969854	How was your day?
1972061	1973462	My week's been all over the place.
1973802	1975262	Oh, let's see.
1975322	1978143	Starting with Monday.
1978243	1979144	Monday was kind of eh.
1979524	1980524	It didn't really do anything.
1980704	1985286	Tuesday, they finally announced that I got the job at my company.
1985306	1988947	So now I'm actually game sales now with a nice bonus and nice pay raise.
1988987	1989948	So that was cool.
1990668	1994329	And so now I'll be selling games and that kind of stuff.
1994730	1995250	So that'll be cool.
1996954	1999777	Then also, let's see what else happened.
1999857	2002679	Then Wednesday, nothing really much.
2002839	2005041	Actually, fast forward to about Friday.
2005441	2006783	Friday went and saw Sin City.
2006823	2007583	That was awesome.
2009745	2020254	Then yesterday, I went and got a PSP because I just had to have a PSP to mess around with.
2020274	2021195	So that was kind of cool.
2021215	2024618	I got Wipeout Pure and Twisted Metal head on.
2025226	2027647	And then I hit a car, and that sucked.
2028108	2029889	That was kind of the down point of the day.
2029929	2033931	It didn't do any damage to the car, really, I mean, other than some paint scrapes.
2033991	2043716	I looked at my car, there's a little bit of a bent part on, next to the, uh, headlight, but I mean, it didn't even break the headlight or anything, and the bent part's just like, ever so slightly.
2044677	2046998	And, I mean, honestly, looking at it, you wouldn't even notice.
2047519	2047819	Um, and...
2048439	2052567	So, you know, I had to call my insurance company and deal with all that crap, so that's just sucked.
2052607	2060323	But, honestly, I don't think anything's going to happen, because, I mean, they've been lowering my insurance, you know, for like the last... I don't even know how many years, and, you know...
2061713	2062354	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2082381	2091405	But it was kind of fun though today with my PSP because I'm actually researching for the future for our website, PSP Access, special page, IRC, that kind of crap.
2091745	2101069	So I actually got on, well of course no one in our chat is going to be able to see it because it's in our mod forms, but I got on and actually made a post on Orange Lounge Radio with a PSP.
2101769	2102630	That's kind of amazing.
2102650	2108312	Now for those who don't know, the way this has been done is there's actually on Wipeout Pure,
2109383	2114128	There's a downloadable content link on the actual main menu there.
2115109	2120956	What's going to happen later on, once they activate it, is you're going to be able to download new maps, new textures, etc.
2122517	2124399	But that's not available right now.
2125080	2128164	The big community that buys PSPs, a lot of them are geeks.
2128524	2129945	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2147900	2169691	and so basically you can make a web page that has a bunch of links on it and like a browser input thing and you can actually connect to different websites that way and I mean this is being covered on Slashdot and Gadget a bunch of different websites so you can find out more about it on there but the new thing that they just started was PSP IRC and you actually can connect to IRC right now it's only one channel
2170372	2171032	DarkSakura.com
2184173	2202790	Now, I've been hearing a lot of folks that are picking up a PSP, what they're actually doing with it is they're using the memory stick to actually put other things onto their PSP, such as pornography, but in more practical senses, their MP3 collections and things of this sort, so they can actually use their PSP as kind of like an iPod replacement, basically.
2202810	2208495	A lot of people are now saying, F the iPod, because I can pick up a PSP and play MP3s on the go, correct?
2209471	2210352	Wipeout Wipeout Wipeout
2228331	2231292	Now, I do, I have been playing Wipeout, and I actually kind of like it now.
2231752	2234833	But, I don't know, there's a few gripes I have.
2234913	2238574	First off, I don't have any dead pixels, so that's all good.
2240314	2242935	Second thing, my background's pink.
2243355	2248377	And now I realize that all the ones I've seen on the internet have been blue or green.
2248477	2249757	Well, I read online today...
2250617	2251778	They change with the months.
2251898	2252659	They change colors.
2253019	2255321	So, that's why it's pink.
2255541	2256302	I couldn't figure it out.
2256322	2258303	I thought it was special or something, but apparently not.
2258383	2263147	April is the month of the Cherry Tree Viewing Festival in Japan.
2263768	2267150	I thought they were just trying to say that, you know, that I got girly PSP.
2267971	2271954	Anyways, so, yeah, I got that in Twisted Metal Head-On.
2272074	2276237	Twisted Metal Head-On is exactly like Twisted Metal 2, just a little graphic upgrade.
2277858	2280939	Now, I like the PSP, the only thing that bugs me is the analog stick.
2281099	2282459	That thing is so uncomfortable.
2283160	2284440	It just, it doesn't work for me.
2285380	2288961	I mean, it would have been nice if they had it above the crosspad.
2289701	2291682	But, other than that, it's been pretty cool.
2292662	2295303	I'm actually hoping to get some more games for it later on.
2298464	2302625	I've also had fun finding open Wi-Fi networks by my house.
2303006	2307447	Apparently there's some neighbors of ours that don't like to password protect their internet.
2307867	2312789	So I just jumped, the only problem is I can only jump on it outside because the signal's not that strong.
2313129	2317011	So I've been browsing the web out on our porch in the cold and rain.
2318263	2320024	But it's quite fun.
2320645	2327289	So all you folks out there, be sure to password check your internet or else you're going to have people jumping on with their PSPs.
2329430	2333933	Now a question I was going to ask you before you were kind of talking about how folks are accessing the PSP networks and everything.
2335174	2342318	What is the probability, since folks are loading MP3s and videos and stuff, of us, and I know you're kind of looking into this, but I'm kind of curious how far away we are from seeing this,
2342622	2349045	You know how we do our podcast we do every week where we have the 25 to 30 minute extra show that we do via the podcast.
2349105	2350526	It's not rehashed material.
2350586	2351666	It's a whole separate thing.
2351686	2354428	So if you want to check that out, just go to orangehawnsradio.com, click on to go.
2356169	2360171	But what is the possibility of folks being able to download that directly onto their PSP?
2360991	2362812	Do we know yet?
2363472	2366894	Right now, I haven't been able... I haven't tried downloading anything.
2367034	2367994	I don't think you can.
2368875	2368955	Um...
2370251	2374078	I would imagine it's probably possible you might not be able to download it, maybe view it.
2374499	2376082	PSP browsing is kind of slow.
2376463	2377926	I mean, it's actually pretty slow.
2379093	2379933	That's the only problem.
2380273	2391157	If you want to get any good speed out of it, you need to disable the... There's a Wi-Fi power save mode on there, and you need to go under your power save options and actually disable that.
2391577	2392998	It'll browse the internet faster.
2393038	2397759	But, man, if you stream... If you try to download something, it's going to take forever.
2398300	2400981	I mean, I don't think you can do it.
2401141	2404922	Maybe streaming media like our website... Not our website, but our...
2405623	2412397	Our actual live station they might be able to pick up, but I don't think downloading a podcast would work.
2414161	2419444	The live station might be kind of difficult too because you have to have that extra hurdle of accessing Live365 and all that.
2419504	2420785	I don't know.
2421945	2425487	Hopefully they'll find something because that would be neat to have Orange Lounge on your PSP.
2425607	2425928	I don't know.
2426428	2427829	If I had a PSP, I think it's pretty cool.
2428049	2433132	Maybe we can create a special edition of our podcast that's like a really, really low bitrate or something.
2433212	2433852	We can think of something.
2434833	2437974	You know, I haven't tried connecting to Live365.
2438014	2441677	That might be interesting to try out because it's all Java, I think.
2441857	2442077	So...
2442937	2459675	The only thing that really doesn't work on it is frames, and I know if you've visited our website, you've seen how on the side there, there's a little forum, the most recent topics that have been posted, and they kind of scroll up, while on the PSP they scroll left, so it's a little weird.
2460373	2469898	You know why I don't think Live 365 would work is because the player, when you actually launch the station, and I think most of you guys who are listening to the station probably have this, it actually pops up in a new window.
2470779	2472480	And I don't think PSP supports pop-ups.
2472580	2478463	At least I hope it doesn't, or you could get pop-ups from almost any site out there and suddenly you'll have spyware all over your PSP.
2478943	2482445	But because the player is in a pop-up, I don't know if it's going to be possible.
2482485	2485127	Now there is the direct access URL you can use, but...
2485587	2492895	I think you can only use it like, I don't remember, 365's official rules, but I think you can only use it three times and then they make you log in.
2493276	2496759	It's been a long time since I've looked at the rules on that.
2497961	2499603	I'm sure there'll be a workaround for it.
2500363	2504488	Already, here's the other thing that they do have already that you can do that people are doing.
2505066	2505927	PSP Casting
2527723	2528304	Thanks for watching!
2544917	2548638	I actually played some DDR today at home, several different mixes.
2548818	2555401	I was showing DDR to somebody who had not seen the Xbox mixes yet, so I got to play some Ultramix 2.
2555881	2559402	I actually worked out, I played some 9s, I was working up a sweat, it was something else.
2559702	2560683	That's good exercise.
2561424	2583224	Other than that, you might remember that earlier this week, I don't know if you listened to Thursday Night Show, but on Thursday Night's program we were talking about Yoshi's Touch and Go on the DS, which is a game that I picked up earlier this week because I don't want to spend $300 on a PSP, and I don't want to spend $150 on Night Style just yet, but I want to buy a game to hold me over until I have more money.
2583604	2587706	So I decided I'd go to GameStop and I was just randomly going to buy myself a new DS game.
2587726	2597332	Well the problem with the Nintendo DS right now, although the technology is excellent and the DS has a lot of potential, I would say about 1% of the DS potential is actually being used right now.
2597612	2600093	Because there's what, like 12 games out there for the DS right now?
2600573	2601634	So there's really not a lot.
2601674	2604956	So when I said I wanted to buy a DS game, my choices were pretty limited.
2605516	2612264	So I finally ended up deciding to pick up this game, Yoshi's Touch and Go, which on Thursday Night Show I just slammed because I did not like the game at all.
2612304	2613626	I thought it was hard to get into.
2613646	2615388	I thought it was the same, repetitive.
2615929	2616870	But this is the weird thing.
2617450	2619793	I still have not been able to put this game down.
2620534	2625180	And I don't know if it's because it's the only DS game that I haven't worn out yet or what, but...
2625640	2628781	I've still been playing this game, it's very, very odd.
2629301	2644207	And I like the fact that you can search for PictoChat rooms, like I've been just, like I was, my friend was driving to the club last night and I was actually playing Yoshi's Touch and Go in the car, searching for PictoChat rooms, trying to see if I could pick up, like, little kids doing PictoChat in the backseat of a car so I could hop on there and go, you know, you suck!
2644567	2645267	You know, or something, but...
2646809	2648490	I didn't play it all this week.
2648590	2649150	You need to help me level.
2649170	2649610	I do party!
2649630	2650050	I am a party girl!
2669585	2671226	Nobody parties like I do, okay?
2671306	2671867	Alright, sorry.
2672527	2673728	You gonna party like it's level 99?
2673788	2678291	What's the damn ferret?
2680253	2681434	Oh, I just got a ferret thrown at me.
2683335	2685217	Anyway, um, no, this is mine now.
2685377	2686297	This is mine, it's in my yard.
2686377	2687558	It's mine.
2688859	2690340	Uh, anyway, I guess that's it for my week and my day.
2690480	2691321	I don't want to drag this out.
2691361	2691821	So, Angel.
2693563	2697245	I found my chains of Prometheus, which means I'm back on the game.
2697866	2697946	Yay.
2698006	2698086	Okay.
2699969	2704573	Anyway, so that was like Thursday, I guess.
2708075	2719423	Tuesday, however, I went to school and went to my class, but only six people showed up, so obviously it got cancelled, and that sucks.
2720064	2723686	So I'm going to wait until August and take it all over again, but it's all good.
2724587	2725067	I can wait.
2725467	2726068	I am patient.
2728823	2731864	Other than that, I played some DDR this week.
2732324	2732604	Yay.
2733064	2739626	Met some people over at the place I usually play at that I hadn't seen in a while, so that was cool.
2741626	2744087	And not much yesterday.
2744307	2747728	Went out and met some people from...
2750098	2759727	Game Called There, I've talked about this many times over, but I actually got to meet the people behind their avatars, so it's cool.
2761249	2763811	Yeah, I just had a really good weekend, and you know.
2764830	2770693	and a really good week, so not too much to complain about, not too much to talk about, really.
2771434	2772014	Pretty boring.
2772334	2777537	But, hey, at least I can play Final Fantasy XI and a couple other games I've been playing.
2777957	2782380	Half-Life 2, Koff, Hack, and other stuff.
2784961	2785561	I guess that's it.
2786082	2788343	Oh, I got Ultramix 2 this week.
2791184	2791905	We must play.
2791925	2793806	What do you think of the DDR Ultramix 2?
2795549	2798290	I don't know why, but my load time sucks.
2799070	2802612	Now, I don't know if that's everyone's cartridge or just mine.
2802712	2804733	I mean, not cartridge, but disc, rather.
2805273	2813636	I don't know if... You know what I've noticed is that booting up DDR Ultramix 2 takes forever, but once you finally get in there, it's not so bad.
2813756	2816257	But it's just the boot up takes a long time.
2816297	2817638	It's like trying to play something on the PSP.
2820188	2825549	Well, I actually thought it was me because, you know, Andrew was like, why is it taking so long?
2825969	2826789	What's going on?
2827109	2828590	It's not supposed to be taking this long.
2828630	2829690	I'm like, I don't know.
2829930	2830750	Should we take it back?
2830810	2831490	He goes, no, no, no.
2831550	2833071	I'm like, okay.
2833291	2840552	You know, he's not giving me a straight answer, so I'm like, well, maybe I'll just ask Rob when I get here tomorrow, which I'm doing now, so that's cool.
2841212	2849394	But I think I do need to get a dual platform pad because the converter I'm using is kind of glitchy.
2849594	2849814	Yuck.
2852011	2852552	All righty.
2866800	2867581	I have a request.
2867621	2868141	That's happy joy stuff.
2885654	2886995	What else are we going to have when we come back?
2887455	2888736	Skyblind, we'll open that up.
2888776	2893019	So go to www.orangelongeradio.com, click on interact with us if you have something you want to talk about.
2893079	2897863	We had a request from the chat room to talk about a video game related tour going on this summer.
2897983	2899785	So we'll talk about that because it's worth mentioning.
2900485	2902647	And other gaming news when we come back.
2903127	2906670	So we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
2906690	2909853	We're going to start it off with a track from Beatmania 2DX11 style.
2909893	2911454	This is Injection of Love.
2912214	2912895	Injection of Love.
2958611	2960114	Thank you for watching!
3064283	3064603	Thank you.
3118517	3119077	Thanks for watching!
3157902	3158967	Thanks for watching!
3197109	3197890	Thanks for watching!
3226997	3227598	Thanks for watching!
3318086	3319449	Thank you for watching!
3353059	3353944	Thank you for watching!
3389039	3398399	And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.
3399148	3403230	Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.
3403250	3404230	Can we talk about that?
3404490	3406852	No subject will ever be taboo.
3407132	3410773	Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.
3411293	3413835	Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.
3414335	3419677	Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?
3420237	3421518	I collect your fucking head.
3423487	3424988	Just like this fucker here.
3426069	3429751	Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?
3430051	3433413	The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!
3434354	3440798	Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!
3442038	3445741	Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.
3450270	3452711	That's right, you guys are going to get a say in this next segment.
3452731	3454632	We are going to turn on the Skype line very soon.
3455012	3459334	If you want more information about what the Skype line is all about, www.orangeloungerator.com.
3459374	3460795	Click on Interact With Us.
3461655	3463576	In that break, you heard a variety of music there.
3464617	3469839	Wrapping it up from 11th Style, Don't Be Afraid Myself, before that Wall 5 with EVO 66.
3471160	3476562	And of course, because Jamie had to hear it, Gradius Full Speed by Mr. T in that break as well.
3476622	3477883	Starting it off, Injection of Love.
3481647	3484949	You know, we have a little bit of competition going on tonight with Orange Launch Radio.
3485289	3490110	Folks are torn between whether they want to listen to Orange Launch Radio or watch WrestleMania.
3490891	3491511	You know what?
3491851	3493031	Or watch baseball.
3493131	3494152	Guilty, guilty, guilty.
3495412	3499594	Had I had a way to the Bay Area today, I'd be watching WrestleMania.
3499874	3500414	You know what?
3500434	3505556	I don't watch wrestling all year anymore, but WrestleMania is like, wow, it's WrestleMania.
3506916	3509277	Get to see my hot, sweaty men's and their drama.
3510914	3511354	Men's.
3511374	3511854	Men's.
3511934	3512355	You're men's.
3512395	3513055	What about the women?
3513075	3514555	There's women wrestlers too, right?
3514595	3515055	Don't they get into it?
3515075	3516136	Yeah, but they're all hoochies now.
3516156	3520857	They used to... WrestleMania 19 was the last one that had women that could actually wrestle.
3521058	3521358	Uh-huh.
3522118	3523658	Just because of the one with Trish Shadis.
3523698	3524819	I just remember Chyna.
3524839	3526359	Because who doesn't remember Chyna?
3526379	3527780	Especially when it's the real life and everything.
3527800	3532161	Yeah, and then she got into TNA and then got her booted from TNA and was all washed up.
3532241	3539584	I mean, okay, she's really awesome and I think if she got her shit together she'd be all, you know, really cool, but...
3540979	3543121	Her time's passed unless she can grab it again.
3543141	3546663	It's just not the same.
3546743	3547864	We need more Roid Girls.
3548225	3550626	Speaking of Surreal Life, have you heard about the new season of Surreal Life?
3551407	3553969	New season of Surreal Life is supposed to have... I mock reality TV.
3554469	3555050	You know what, though?
3555070	3556391	But you know you love the Surreal Life.
3556631	3558572	Come on, didn't you watch the previous one a little bit?
3558913	3559153	No.
3559633	3560914	Well, you should.
3561074	3562475	It had Jaina in it and Mini-Me.
3562575	3565397	I watched the one where they were branding cattle.
3565638	3566218	Okay, there you go.
3566278	3567459	So you watched at least one episode.
3567499	3568640	So you kind of know what the show's about.
3569326	3573628	and I did watch one episode before the first episode because I got to see Flava Flav.
3573908	3577009	Okay, so you watched like season three or two or three, I don't remember what it was.
3577029	3577869	I watched episodes.
3578089	3578349	Okay.
3578730	3579850	I can count them on one hand.
3579910	3585512	Well, the new season is going to be good because they're going to have Omarosa who now... Oh, I know you're happy.
3585572	3586452	Wasn't she your hero?
3587233	3588193	I loved that woman.
3588233	3595296	She was on The Apprentice and I didn't love her because I actually thought she was cool but I loved to hate her.
3595436	3596936	No, I don't think... Anyway.
3598397	3598517	Nope.
3600083	3605266	Also what I love is Balki from Perfect Strangers is supposed to be on Surreal Life 5.
3605306	3606506	And that is just so cool to me.
3606767	3610549	Because what the heck has Balki done since Perfect Strangers?
3612730	3613530	He's in a B-movie.
3613570	3613970	I have it.
3613990	3615951	I'm going to be bringing it home soon, actually.
3616251	3619573	He needs to do Old Navy commercials now, just like the other washed-up actors.
3620334	3626797	Well, either you do Old Navy commercials or you join the Surreal Life cast.
3628191	3630313	What happened to the other guy that was on Perfect Strangers?
3630353	3634716	They said bring back Perfect Strangers.
3634896	3635656	That's not a bad idea.
3635676	3637117	I mean, they're not doing anything.
3637217	3638818	I mean, no one knows them for anything.
3638918	3639479	Bring it back.
3639499	3641300	I mean, it can't be worse than Joey.
3644642	3646083	Julie, get your butt over here and say hi.
3647344	3649066	Oh, we have a special guest that just came in the studio.
3649086	3649886	Get your butt over.
3649926	3651327	Has Julie ever been on the show before?
3651968	3653709	She's as webcam shy as I am.
3654189	3655690	No, Julie hasn't been on the show before.
3655710	3656371	Well, hi, Julie.
3656551	3656851	Say hello.
3658188	3658928	Hi, audience!
3660609	3670976	This is Julie, also known on DaWeb, the big internet monster as Kasumi19, who never updates her live journal, except once every six months.
3672737	3675718	They can't hear what you say if you don't talk into the microphone, as you know.
3675738	3678760	Actually, it's been about nine months.
3679040	3679561	I'm horrible.
3680281	3680781	Here's Rob.
3680941	3681822	PSO addict.
3682861	3683501	I play some PSO sometimes.
3683521	3685282	Julie still needs to give me my Opa Opa.
3707859	3709700	Alright, let's see, moving on.
3710160	3711501	That was enough pop culture news.
3711561	3715543	Let's talk about some actual Bomani news going on out there in the scene.
3716063	3724068	Actually, surprisingly, not a whole heck of a lot, with the exception of some follow-up to the earlier announcement about 2DX Happy Sky.
3724768	3725568	You know, you hear this?
3725588	3727890	2DX 12th Style is going to be called Happy Sky.
3728290	3729330	Happy, happy, happy!
3730551	3731271	Brain twitch.
3731512	3732092	I know, I know.
3733985	3735887	Some very interesting things.
3736347	3738529	They are just changing things upside down.
3740170	3745034	Now all this is kind of coming off test location data, so it could be subject to change.
3746175	3749678	High speed is going to be in there now, but it's going to be in halves as well.
3749938	3752019	So you can play one speed, two speed.
3752059	3754301	You could kind of do that before, but now you can have half, 1.5, 2.5.
3754622	3755522	I think that's kind of cool.
3759205	3763468	They're supposed to be also hidden plus and sudden plus available in there.
3764228	3765749	S random mode as well.
3765769	3778237	With the sudden plus and hidden plus, they're also, they have adjustable hidden sudden areas to where you can pretty much decide where the notes appear or they disappear, etc.
3780151	3781453	Now here's the other very interesting thing.
3781513	3788122	Instead of Light, Normal, Another, now it's going to be Normal, Hyper, Another.
3788182	3794730	And this being probably, I think, some of the biggest news, the ratings are all changing because now Another's are going to be ranked.
3795151	3808035	So now instead of being like 1 through 8 with flashing 8s, which is the way it is now, for a lot of folks that are on home versions, you might only have seen 1 through 7 with flashing 7s, but in the arcades now it's 1 through 8 with flashing 8s.
3808355	3809636	Now it's going to be 1 through 12.
3811056	3812197	About damn time.
3812357	3817779	One of the reported level 12 songs, V Another, which, you know, if you've ever seen V Another.
3818179	3821660	Yeah, and I would think that Sakura would be up there.
3822284	3822704	I don't know.
3822965	3825590	They're saying right now that that is the only level 12 one.
3827648	3834513	I think that as far as the DJ Lee Su videos, that was the only one he had to do with using two hands.
3836894	3837795	It's some scary stuff.
3839916	3844299	And then some pictures are available if you visit our website, www.orangelandredo.com.
3844339	3853845	And of course, some of the news, I think we might have touched on this a little bit last week, I don't remember, but there is a crossover artist showing up from DDR Ultramix 2.
3855386	3857827	Big Idea, who did the song Toe Jam.
3858168	3865771	Toe Jam is going to be in Happy Sky, which is really weird that a USA artist is crossing over into 2DX.
3865811	3866572	That's kind of neat, though.
3867392	3871114	Well, there's good talent all over the world.
3871134	3883380	There is, there is, but when I think of all the possible DDR songs in history that were created for DDR that should cross over into Beatmania 2DX, Toe Jam isn't really the first one that comes to my mind.
3884269	3888250	It's not a bad start, just, you know, it could be better.
3888650	3891671	Well, they've gotten European artists.
3891691	3893891	I guess that's true.
3896352	3902673	Some other artists coming back as well, Twin Amadeus, Platonic X, a lot of folks you know.
3902773	3904074	Ryu, of course, going to be back.
3904154	3906194	Ryu kind of just started all of a sudden showing up all the time.
3906494	3907774	Terra, all those folks.
3909035	3910055	Check that out, that will be...
3911252	3915578	Location testing currently and hopefully coming to an arcade near you pretty soon.
3919491	3922093	I guess that's pretty much the biggest Bomani news going on right now.
3922133	3923954	I can think of some local Bomani news going on.
3924014	3926336	I want to touch on this, and then we'll open up the skyline.
3926356	3928878	In Sacramento, two things, jack and shit.
3929279	3931700	Well, actually, no, there's a pretty big story going on right now.
3932041	3935683	But it's at an arcade we don't really go to a whole lot, Roseville Golf Land.
3936544	3941308	Now, understandably, we are an international radio program, so we have folks that listen all over.
3941348	3943770	But sometimes we talk about our neck of the woods, which is Sacramento.
3944190	3945231	And we have this arcade here.
3945251	3946852	It's a beautiful arcade.
3946892	3948273	It's a two-story arcade.
3948733	3951195	Huge arcade with a fancy water park.
3951836	3952296	It's ghetto.
3952457	3953137	It's ghetto as hell.
3953417	3960543	Because parents drop their children off there and just leave them there to wreak havoc on the whole place and so they break machines and everything.
3960844	3961724	Well, here's the great news.
3962085	3968210	Roseville Golf Land got Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania V. The brand new ones.
3969591	3970592	I have a reason to go again.
3970792	3972073	Already the hi-hat is broken.
3973414	3976197	Okay, why does that crap not surprise me whatsoever?
3978291	3981358	and the green button on the left guitar is broken as well.
3981979	3986067	At least some woman didn't try to change her baby's diaper on it like on Little Keyboard Mania.
3987109	3989013	Probably would have if there was a platform to do so.
3993197	3994638	So, you know, that's great.
3994658	4001844	We're all excited because we're getting the new Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania V. And it's very interesting because I was talking to one of our listeners before the show who lives in Vegas.
4002244	4011111	And they're all excited because they just got 2DX Red and Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania V. And I'm like, yeah, we got it too, except, you know, 2DX Red doesn't work.
4011171	4012932	It's just a frame without a monitor right now.
4013172	4015634	And Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania V, both broken.
4018236	4018756	You know what?
4019597	4020898	They should let me run Golf Land.
4023001	4028435	First of all, there would be absolutely none of those retards that piss me off allowed.
4029577	4032385	Would there actually be a sign on the door that says no retards that piss me off?
4032907	4033407	Exactly.
4034167	4041749	And I'll have a list of the people that I've actually had kicked out so that they would know specifically that they are not allowed in.
4042510	4045610	And then I would have to have some type of scanning device, I think.
4045871	4049592	Maybe we would be like the, you remember the Studio 54?
4049652	4050132	Yes, I do.
4050152	4054593	We would be the Studio 54 of the 21st century.
4056113	4056713	I like that idea.
4057054	4058654	Except with no cocaine bar in the back room.
4060865	4061606	How about a heroin bar?
4061646	4062326	Can we have that instead?
4062907	4065089	Okay, we can have heroin, but we have to move to the Netherlands.
4065530	4067432	All right.
4067792	4073838	Okay, so I just want to kind of catch you up on that, that we're all excited to have Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania V in town.
4074178	4078823	And I would give you my full review, however, that shit's broken, so I can't.
4078923	4079564	So sorry, guys.
4081085	4083107	Maybe we'll go take some pictures of the broken stuff.
4083127	4083468	We'll see.
4084128	4085970	Anyway, we are going to open up the Skype line.
4086010	4095136	If you guys want to call in and interact with our program, you have something you want to comment on, such as possibly the new 2DX Happy Sky, something that's going on in your neck of the woods.
4095197	4097818	I know there were a couple DDR tournaments that went on pretty recently.
4099220	4100180	We'll open up the Skype line.
4100200	4102142	In fact, we're already getting a call, so let's go to it.
4102202	4103523	Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
4104181	4110170	Emerging from the shadows of Bimani style, here's your resident 2DX bastard, DarkLionXVI.
4110190	4110971	Hey Sky, sit here.
4111492	4119024	Wow, you've got quite a... I should get a fanfare to play when he introduces... Alright, what's on your mind, buddy?
4119721	4125303	Well, yeah, I already told you that Vegas has officially gone V and Red.
4125343	4129265	We have Guitadora V and 2DX Red as of last Thursday.
4129305	4133846	Yeah, so you were the person I was mentioning a little bit earlier that was telling me about what's going on in Vegas.
4134187	4138248	Now, did you hear what I was just saying about Roseville Golf Lands got all that too, except none of it works?
4138448	4138928	Yeah, okay.
4139429	4140149	Yeah, we're lucky here.
4141229	4145511	Oh, and about 2DX 12, Happy Sky, I have to mention to you the...
4146272	4155778	songs that are 12 stars on single oh dude is there more than just be another I only had heard of be another what else is there uh there's a ace double ace
4156782	4170272	Colors Radio Edit, Time, Genocide, Gigadelic, Innocent Walls, Moonchild, One More Lovely, Please Don't Go, and Piano Kyousokyoku Dai Ichiban Sasoribi, a.k.a.
4170312	4171033	P.F.
4171093	4175576	Concerto Artiaris, Sakura, and Setsugekka,
4182816	4184196	So there are quite a few Anothers.
4184257	4185397	Okay, that's good.
4185717	4188518	Good difficulty there for the folks that can actually do that stuff.
4188898	4189718	More power to ya.
4190219	4194160	I'm lucky if I can pass an 8, especially considering I haven't played in quite some time.
4194440	4198481	But I'm really excited about the Anothers actually having rankings now.
4198921	4203343	Because, you know, I follow 2DX, but I'm not, like, super obsessed.
4203363	4204563	Like, I don't study note charts.
4204583	4206364	Like, I have friends that do this, and that's cool.
4206684	4207664	I don't, you know, that's cool.
4207684	4208305	That's what they're into.
4208745	4208825	Um...
4209765	4215810	But, like, if I'm going to play in Another, I want to instantly be able to know which Another is in my range.
4215850	4221335	Because you know how, like, Holic was like a 6, but the Another for Holic is freaking insane?
4221796	4224518	Like, you know, so I want to know about where the Another's stand.
4224558	4228682	Whereas, like, Dual Control Another, from what I remember, was not that much harder than the original.
4229062	4231884	So, it's just, you know, I want to know where they stand on the scale.
4231925	4233666	So that's going to be very helpful to somebody like me.
4233746	4234627	So I'm excited about that.
4236617	4240480	And then the singles for 11 stars, it's already listed here on this website.
4242062	4245764	I got to mention it, the reds are going to be in another.
4246265	4252370	First, Samurai, Andromeda, Blox, checking you out, click again, Daddy Daddy,
4252950	4282043	FakeTimeHyper, G2, GigadelicHyper, Judeka, GreenEyes, HalfwayOfPromise, Holic, InnocentWallsHyper, Kechak, Key, LowerWorld, Lucy, LoveToMeUchisEdition, Murmurtwins, Nemesis, Number13, WarnoR8, Quasar, R5, RainbowFlyer, RainbowRainbow, SecretOfLove, SpaceFight, Spyka, SpiralGalaxy, Stoic, TakeItEasy, WonderBullFighter, and Xenon.
4282483	4283684	And those are all the 11s?
4284364	4285765	Yeah, the 11s are.
4286005	4286806	Interesting, wow.
4287486	4289627	Stoic Another's not a 12, it's an 11?
4289727	4291548	Well, I guess I could see that, though.
4292489	4294730	Compared to, like, Moonchild Another, I guess I could see that.
4295971	4296291	Alright.
4296992	4300253	So what else is going on besides that 2DX update?
4300754	4308178	I just sent you a private message about the videos for the location test on the 2DX 12 Happy Sky.
4308418	4311180	And I'm gonna post it on the chat room.
4311434	4314616	Yeah, post us a link there in the chatroom at orangezonesradio.com, click on chat.
4315016	4318498	And for those who are listening, it's at xenon.sub.jp.
4319158	4319679	Okay, cool.
4320019	4324901	So post that link in our chatroom and then folks can check out the Happy Sky test location videos.
4325182	4327643	Can you actually hear any of the music at all in some of this?
4327683	4328403	It's very clear.
4328683	4329084	Oh, good.
4329624	4334987	The first video that I checked out is 100% Minimoog by Sota Fujimori.
4335267	4336007	Oh, okay, cool.
4336067	4336848	How's the song sound?
4337663	4338564	It's really fast.
4338705	4341708	It's at 252 BPM.
4342690	4344231	Well, I'll have to check that out a little later.
4344632	4347455	If it's clear enough, maybe we'll play some on the show a little later.
4347496	4348717	Really clear.
4348937	4349478	Very cool.
4350219	4350639	All right.
4351160	4352542	Anything else you want to share with us tonight, Siggy?
4353123	4356904	Well, last thing I want to say is quit calling it bad styles.
4356964	4358964	You always keep on calling it 11th style.
4359265	4363065	I know, but it's just... I don't know how to explain it.
4363105	4365846	It's just... It's the style thing.
4366346	4373248	It's just, yeah, it's like, you know, 10th style and then it just seems logical the next 2DX because they haven't changed the hardware or anything.
4373268	4379810	They've only changed... They really haven't changed much than what they changed going from 5th to 6th and 6th to 7th and so on.
4380230	4381490	So, yeah, I just...
4382150	4383151	Naturally call it Eleven.
4383171	4384492	I know it's Red and Happy Sky.
4384772	4388974	But seriously, do you expect me to call this new 2DX Happy Sky and keep a straight face?
4389955	4393397	I know you... Everybody can tell you're gonna call it Twelfth Style.
4394097	4396979	And speaking of Twelfth Style, there is such a song called Twelfth Style.
4397759	4398019	Huh.
4401521	4404223	In Happy Sky, there's gonna be a song called Twelfth Style?
4404663	4404903	Yeah.
4405383	4405963	That's pretty cool.
4407224	4409365	So maybe it's okay, then, that I call it Twelfth Style.
4409866	4409966	Yeah.
4409986	4410186	Yeah.
4410709	4414992	Alright, well thank you for the pronunciation update, I appreciate it.
4415512	4418914	Well, not so much pronunciation, but you know, like referring to, anyway.
4419254	4422056	I gotta mention the videos on the Sinon subs that they have.
4422836	4427339	The first one is Captivate Joker, which means Purify.
4428080	4431202	Second video they have is Get Cool, which is Moonlight.
4432242	4433703	And then the third one is Green Eyes.
4434363	4437585	And then the last one is the video that I mentioned is 100% Minimoog.
4437605	4437685	Okay.
4441324	4443185	I might have to check that out because I want to hear some of those songs.
4443225	4445406	I want to hear what they sound like, so I'll definitely be looking at that.
4445946	4446146	Yeah.
4446446	4446726	All right.
4447347	4447587	All right.
4447747	4448627	Well, thanks for the call, bud.
4448827	4449328	You have a good one.
4450028	4450248	Later.
4450348	4450768	All right, later.
4452529	4454270	Resident 2DX Bastard Siggy.
4454310	4455490	We always like hearing from him.
4455550	4457091	Let's go to another call.
4457932	4459252	Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
4459952	4461233	Greetings, it's Ranma South.
4461253	4462873	Tell me one more time, how are you guys doing?
4462953	4463713	Good, how are you doing?
4464553	4465373	Somewhat tired.
4465573	4467874	I want you to know that I am a devoted fan of the show.
4468374	4474235	I went to Boston this weekend, and I arranged my trip so I can come back in time to catch the show.
4474375	4475235	That's hardcore.
4475675	4475975	Yes, it is.
4475995	4477056	That's very hardcore.
4477576	4479076	You didn't have to do that for us.
4479156	4484237	I mean, heck, if I was going to Boston, I wouldn't have rearranged my trip to come back for this show.
4484557	4485838	But we adore you for it.
4485858	4487138	You are awesome and fabulous.
4487158	4488459	Yes, you are awesome and fabulous.
4488859	4489799	Well, I do try.
4490160	4491040	Alright, right on.
4491500	4492241	What else is on your mind?
4492601	4494281	What's been going on in your gaming world this week?
4495102	4495642	Not much.
4496062	4498984	I've been playing some of my old PS2 games recently.
4499664	4501085	Right now I'm trying to work through Musashi.
4501125	4501845	I'm in love with it.
4503410	4505071	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4530760	4535343	I watched it a bit when it came on TV, but I was so not into Johnny Depp at the time.
4535403	4536404	It was all River Phoenix.
4537524	4538385	Okay, alright.
4538865	4541327	But maybe now you'd have more respect for it?
4541347	4541767	I don't know.
4543008	4543408	Not really.
4543568	4544889	Okay, sorry.
4545209	4546350	Oh, by the way, guess what?
4546810	4547150	Ranma?
4547751	4548171	Yeah, what's up?
4548591	4552393	I found a doco CD at the used record store today.
4553014	4553834	First or second?
4555035	4556336	Actually, it was one of the later ones.
4557179	4561802	You know, my fiancé, when I moved in with him, had something like 22 Ranma CDs.
4562262	4562563	Yeah.
4562763	4564524	I also found the Fighting Karuta there, too.
4564544	4567886	I had that, and I lost it.
4568046	4568767	Well, you know what?
4569507	4571909	Why don't I set a little time aside in the week?
4571949	4573910	If it's still there, I will grab you the Fighting Karuta.
4574631	4575051	Sweet.
4575131	4575491	I appreciate that.
4575531	4577272	Because it has the Okonomiyaki song on it.
4578053	4578633	Awesome.
4579894	4580094	Wow.
4580114	4580875	That's really awesome.
4580975	4582096	Okonomiyaki.
4582796	4583517	I can't do it anymore.
4585098	4585798	Okonomiyaki.
4588345	4591007	You have to cosplay Ucchan one of these days, you got to.
4591347	4595369	You know, I've been working and working on that, and I keep saying that I'll do it, and I never do.
4596470	4598691	Half the fun is walking around with a giant spatula.
4600632	4601773	I cosplayed Baiken once.
4602553	4603033	Sweet.
4603253	4604774	I don't think I've seen pictures of that.
4605455	4610578	There's one on FansView back in the day, and then there was one of me as Mad Hatter for Angel Sanctuary.
4610598	4612839	Okay, I'm going to have to go digging through that.
4612859	4614740	I'm going to have to ask Kevin if he can send it to me.
4615089	4616450	I'll see if I have it somewhere.
4617090	4617611	It's horrible.
4618011	4619772	It was like 60 pounds heavier in it.
4622094	4623415	But you probably still look hot anyway.
4624275	4625136	That is so sweet.
4625156	4625856	Oh my, oh my.
4626777	4627798	Oh, fluster.
4628158	4629359	Ego fluster.
4629399	4631880	Yeah, she's already living on another planet tonight.
4631900	4632841	We don't need to, you know.
4632861	4634402	Hey, I am a celebrity.
4634962	4636363	Yeah, exactly, exactly.
4636383	4637504	You just watch it.
4638945	4641067	Just for that, I'll eat a bag of M&M's just for you.
4642748	4642848	Aww.
4644207	4647711	Alright, any other ass you want to kiss while you're on the line here, Ranma?
4648733	4651917	I love you, Sky, because you're still a devoted fan of the DS.
4653058	4653419	I am.
4653779	4655021	I have faith in the DS.
4655361	4656502	Well, I appreciate that.
4656542	4657123	Thank you, Rob.
4659051	4660172	Not that DS.
4661814	4664457	Every time somebody says DS, DarkSakura goes, hee hee, that's me.
4664477	4665758	Well, why wouldn't they think about me?
4665859	4666139	I know.
4666599	4670744	But no, it's hard for me to be a fan of the DS right now because we're in a little bit of a slump.
4671304	4673006	But I am still a fan of the DS.
4673267	4678412	You know, and I think it's okay for me to say I am a fan of both the DS and the PSP.
4678813	4679714	There's nothing wrong with that.
4679874	4680494	I like them both.
4681155	4681575	I agree.
4681675	4687079	I'm going to buy a PSP once Sony fixes all the kinks, and I'll wait for a second or third generation unit.
4687279	4691002	I'm just not a fan of the price of the PSP, but I'll get over it.
4691082	4694825	I'll get over it eventually.
4695105	4695845	$250, please.
4697026	4698587	We couldn't even buy them when they came out.
4698727	4701850	If it came with Luminous packed in, that would so be worth it.
4702410	4702770	We'll see.
4703411	4703611	Yeah.
4704173	4705195	Alright, well I'm going to let you go.
4705256	4705877	Have a good one, buddy.
4706438	4706739	You too.
4706799	4707521	Enjoy the rest of the week.
4707541	4709304	Thanks for calling.
4709324	4710467	Have a good week.
4710627	4710828	Bye.
4711810	4713333	Let's see if we can get in one more call at least.
4713413	4714877	Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
4715663	4716984	Hey, SSJ100 Matt here.
4717144	4718345	Hello, SSJ100 Matt.
4718365	4718945	What's on your mind?
4720026	4720746	Nothing.
4721467	4722808	I guess I was going to beat you to the punch.
4722828	4726090	I was going to talk about the Dear Friends.
4726890	4727571	Ah, yes, that's right.
4727591	4728531	You were the one that sent that to me.
4728551	4731733	Yes, I was going to make a mention of this after the segment, but that's okay.
4732354	4732694	All right.
4733174	4735376	What's going on with the Dear Friends?
4735556	4737497	What's this news you found out about Dear Friends?
4738018	4741559	Well, I just found out about this earlier this weekend.
4742279	4746500	It turns out that the Dear Friends Fallen Fantasy concert is coming to the East Coast.
4747540	4754781	So, and like, we're not talking Chicago, which to some of us in California, Chicago counts as East Coast, but not really to the rest of America.
4755161	4761222	So, you know, now it's actually going to be in an East Coast state, so some of you guys are going to be able to catch this.
4761302	4763583	So, you have some of the details you want to tell our listeners?
4764423	4764523	Um...
4766004	4768066	They're going to not be in the major cities.
4768086	4771170	They're going to be in corners of the East Coast.
4772011	4775295	First one is going to be on May 20th in Hartford, Connecticut.
4776416	4776796	Right on.
4777197	4778398	I have friends who live in Connecticut.
4778498	4779860	They'll be happy about that information.
4780273	4780473	Yeah.
4781374	4786038	And in June 24th and the 25th, Atlanta, Georgia is going to have it.
4786358	4788199	Okay, so some Southeast fun there.
4788299	4788640	Okay.
4789560	4796266	And then for some reason they put in San Diego for East Coast touring.
4796706	4798347	San Diego, North Carolina.
4799548	4802191	No, it's San Diego, California is getting another show.
4802231	4803492	So there you go.
4803552	4806934	So for those of you that maybe missed out on a previous L.A.
4806954	4807855	show, here's your chance.
4807875	4808756	You can go to San Diego.
4808776	4808916	It's up.
4809557	4810857	That's going to be July 14th.
4810897	4815899	And then July 23rd and the 24th, they're going to have it in Detroit.
4816839	4817319	Very cool.
4817399	4819379	Try not to get shot at that concert, by the way.
4819920	4820780	Well, I won't go to that one.
4820800	4822180	I'll go to the Hartford one.
4822220	4822640	Very cool.
4823120	4825041	I have friends in Connecticut who would be interested in going.
4825501	4828021	If I had time off work, I would go, but I won't.
4828742	4829222	And the money.
4829662	4831082	And money, yeah, absolutely.
4832022	4835263	I'm looking forward, though, to the More Friends concert that's going to be happening in L.A.
4835303	4837584	I do have tickets, so I'm very excited about that.
4837644	4838324	So we'll see what happens.
4839517	4852582	But, yep, um, ad here, I'm waiting for In The Groove to finally come I mean, it's been sitting in a DDR4th Mix case for about two months And it's just not working, or?
4853322	4864587	No, they just have, they have, like, the logo for In The Groove and everything on it And they still just have 4th Mix playing on it Somebody's too lazy to get in there and switch it over
4865307	4866288	I mean, it's Golfland.
4866308	4867549	You guys know what I'm talking about.
4867569	4868549	Ah, okay, okay.
4868950	4870991	Wait, I didn't know Golfland existed on the East Coast.
4871431	4872612	No, it's Arizona.
4872712	4875534	No, I'm from the East Coast, but I'm going to school in Arizona.
4875714	4876194	Gotcha.
4876275	4876875	Okay, I'm sorry.
4876935	4877555	Okay, gotcha.
4878256	4878556	Huh.
4879477	4880457	That's kind of... Okay.
4880898	4883559	So they've got in the groove just sitting there waiting to go.
4883660	4884200	Okay, well...
4884591	4888792	In the Groove, you know, for me, there's good things about it and there's bad things about it.
4888832	4890113	I've said this just about every week.
4890233	4897275	I find it very interesting what's going on on the Freak right now, over on DDR Freak, about their April Fool's post.
4897895	4904897	They've turned into these huge In the Groove vs. DDR messes, and I'm just kind of like, can't we all just get along?
4906958	4910221	You know, there's things to like and things to not like about both games.
4910341	4911662	Everybody can improve a little bit.
4912042	4921008	I just, I really don't like that attitude, though, when folks, you know, I guess this is the one thing I will say kind of against in the group, but it's not really the game itself so much as the fan base.
4921369	4926713	But I really hate it when people come on and go, ah, DDR's dead, time to move on.
4927639	4933442	Well, okay, didn't they just release a press release in January that said DDR sold a million copies?
4933722	4935143	Yeah, DDR is like really dead.
4935543	4941466	Maybe DDR is dead in the arcades, but that's only because, you know, Konami's stupid, for lack of a better term.
4942026	4944527	But as far as the home releases go, DDR is far from dead.
4945268	4950130	And I firmly believe that DDR will continue to own In the Groove on the home releases.
4950810	4956513	But In the Groove is going to pick up the arcade stuff if DDR doesn't do anything, so it's going to be interesting.
4959326	4960988	No, I'm just anxious to try it.
4961028	4961668	That's it.
4961688	4963050	Because everyone's talking about it.
4963150	4966314	So I'm just wondering if the hype's what it is.
4966955	4969277	Well, you'll have to let us know what you think once you get a chance to try it out.
4969638	4969978	Yeah.
4970278	4970659	Alright.
4972225	4975447	Yep, I'm watching the Yankee game and listening to you guys.
4976008	4977009	Alright, sounds good.
4978030	4981393	Alright, well enjoy the game and I guess we'll talk to you another time.
4981513	4981793	Alright?
4982374	4982954	Yep, take it easy.
4983014	4983575	Alright, have a good one.
4983835	4984155	Bye-bye.
4985176	4986938	Watching the game, having a bud.
4988560	4989300	Sitting back.
4989320	4990281	Wasabi!
4990321	4991102	Smoking a bud.
4991142	4991622	No, I'm kidding.
4992743	4993244	Alright.
4995306	4996086	Wasabi!
4997640	5001762	I watched the sushi restaurant version of the What's Up last night.
5003062	5003463	Oh, really?
5003723	5004083	Yeah.
5005463	5008565	Was that on the internet for download?
5009205	5016228	When I was at Iguana Girls last night, we were going through some of her old discs, and it was one of the things on there, too, along with Tokyo Breakfast.
5017725	5019769	And the edited picture of Quasimodo.
5029392	5035654	Now, that was posted on Iguana Girls Journal earlier, which made me laugh, because... That was an old DDR freak joke.
5035674	5036915	That was an old-ass joke, yeah.
5037175	5037635	But funny.
5039156	5040916	Nobody knows what the hell we're talking about, so forget it.
5041497	5045338	Let's just move on to... We're going to go ahead and close up the skyline for now.
5045358	5047679	If you didn't get through, try again later, okay?
5049320	5053902	What we're going to do now, though, is we're going to move on to the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match!
5054682	5054922	Woo-hoo!
5059850	5065898	Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio cage match, we had a champion for two weeks in a row.
5066819	5070524	Yoko Kanno went into the second week of victory with Rise.
5070965	5073028	So will she be able to make it three weeks?
5073188	5074129	We shall find out.
5075303	5080806	The way the cage match works, for those of you guys who haven't listened before, we do three songs against each other.
5080866	5083107	Each host picks a song and it does battle.
5083527	5087589	You guys are the ones that ultimately vote for the winner, so you have to be in our chat room to participate.
5088129	5092011	www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat.
5092291	5097134	You only get to hear a clip of last week's winner, because you already heard it last week.
5097594	5103777	So here it is, a clip of last week's winner, song number one, Yoko Kanno with Rise.
5103837	5104097	Enjoy.
5214776	5218618	Thank you for watching!
5248445	5253230	I'm a little pissed off at how poorly received Kelly Clarkson was last week.
5253250	5254150	So I've decided...
5271015	5273818	Screw you guys, I'm putting in Britney Spears.
5275039	5283588	So here it is, song number two, from me to you with love, Britney Spears with Every Time, the Valentin remix.
5329288	5346613	I feel so small, I guess I need you, baby I'm running from the deep, moving my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you, baby Baby, baby Baby
5398030	5412055	You make my dreams, I see your face, your heart is in me, I guess I need you baby I may have made a mistake, please look at me, my weakness caused your pain
5428729	5435994	And every time I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small
5460015	5462359	Thank you for watching!
5485777	5488900	All right, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.
5489480	5490401	Britney Spears!
5491302	5493705	Every time, can't wait to hear the votes on this one.
5493745	5496628	Let's go around, start it off with DarkSakura.
5498309	5501973	Minus 57, because it's Britney Spears.
5501993	5507399	I don't know, the music was okay, it was just like, hi, I'm Clicky Cutter Pop.
5508985	5510726	And it made me feel nauseous.
5511926	5515968	So much that not even a coconut cream pie would bring back my appetite.
5516508	5517249	I'm sorry, Rob.
5517869	5519450	That was... That's alright.
5519490	5520910	I'm not going to take it personally tonight.
5520930	5521410	Just awful.
5521590	5521871	Alright.
5522931	5523651	Beyond awful.
5523851	5524071	Alright.
5524091	5524952	Here, Julie, rate this thing.
5525292	5527613	Negative 57 from DarkSakura.
5527973	5529274	Let me go to Loki, then we'll get to Julie.
5529334	5529594	Loki!
5530495	5533036	You know, that didn't even really sound like Britney Spears to me.
5533596	5536416	I don't know, it just didn't sound like it to me.
5536816	5541257	But I hate her because she ruined my prerogatives, so... Amen!
5541618	5543338	You know, she gets a minus one.
5543498	5545798	I'm not going to go as far as 57 because that's just ridiculous.
5547419	5548139	Alright, Julie!
5548839	5549519	I go with minus 58.
5549939	5552500	I just had to be the one giving her the lowest score of all.
5553480	5553840	Alright.
5553860	5554700	Because it's just fitting.
5555461	5555881	Fair enough.
5556561	5556801	Angel!
5559392	5559772	No.
5560513	5561694	Just no.
5562975	5565637	You ruined my something or other.
5566178	5572363	God, just, um, negative infinity.
5574925	5576326	Oh, Loki's going to change his vote.
5576827	5581430	My vote is going to be 158 plus infinity, so it's an even zero for that song.
5583892	5584393	Shut up!
5584633	5585234	Alright, um...
5586627	5589769	Me, personally, I will be the only one to give it a positive score.
5589889	5591330	Obviously, I'm the one to put that in there.
5591750	5595953	I give that song a 7, because, you know, it's not that bad.
5597093	5600275	It's a dance remix, and like Loki said, it barely sounds like Britney at all.
5600915	5601476	And you know what?
5601516	5602476	You guys earned it.
5603037	5604478	Taint of evil, Rob.
5604498	5605478	Taint of evil.
5605618	5606339	You earned it.
5606759	5607279	And you know what?
5607359	5610901	It was worth it alone for the chatroom's reaction, honestly.
5611322	5612742	I should do that more often.
5612802	5613943	Thank you for the encouragement.
5614423	5615064	Alright, uh...
5616209	5618051	Let's get into song number three, Loki!
5619952	5623455	Okay, um, now this song, I made it for a couple reasons.
5624156	5641772	One, uh, well, first off, the song I made, okay, um, this is, basically, I found this Max remix on Barmani Style by this guy named DJ Pato, he's like some Spanish guy, and he really sucks at making remixes, and he made this song called Max Extension, which is retarded,
5642412	5649614	But it had this really cool song in the background in it, and I was like, you know, hey, that'd be a pretty cool song to make a Max remix out of, so that's what I did.
5649934	5662778	So, adding to my next installment of, you know, the Legend of Trance series, this is also, this was supposed to be because my original thought for the April Fool's joke was going to be Max 300 Radio, and this was going to debut at the end.
5663738	5683504	Well, that didn't happen, so... Um, and it's... Well, this would... The song would be called Legend of Techno, but that's just retarded, and since I already have, you know, Legend of Trance and Legend of Trance 2004, this is Legend of Trance 2005 with the new synonym Maximum GX, and, you know, the song's remixed from F-Zero TX, so... Enjoy!
5685384	5690386	Here it is, Loki's putting in... And I know you guys hate Max remixes, but... Livs.
5691573	5692375	All right, here it is.
5692575	5694959	Loki is putting in his own creation.
5695460	5696782	It's a Max remix.
5696882	5700508	It's Maximum GX with Legend of Trance 2005.
5700669	5701751	Here it is, song number three.
5755976	5756844	Thanks for watching!
5791167	5791929	Thanks for watching!
5861786	5864927	Song number three, Legend of Trance, 2005.
5865067	5866288	Let's see what they thought of it.
5866328	5867328	DarkSakura.
5868848	5870829	My head hurts!
5872790	5873050	Okay.
5873770	5875831	Um, it was, I'm sorry, it was Max.
5877431	5878292	It made my head hurt.
5879392	5879912	I twitched.
5881713	5883714	But it's not Britney Spears, so it gets a seven.
5883734	5886095	Alright, Loki.
5887995	5888635	It's okay.
5889296	5890116	I, I tried.
5891027	5897213	I really don't care, just gonna play the song later anyway, so... It gets a 9, because I made it.
5899215	5900276	Is Julie got a mic?
5900356	5901337	Can Julie give it a rank there?
5902278	5904880	Let's... Here comes Julie.
5906842	5909484	I give that song... Hmm... A 2.
5909645	5911186	I really wasn't paying much attention though.
5911346	5911827	I'm sorry.
5912427	5913508	Alright, that's alright.
5914429	5915310	Uh, I give it...
5917296	5917396	Angel
5939929	5947160	By the way, I'd like to give the whole, um, Initial D soundtrack a big fat zero because your beat sucks ass!
5948723	5949303	Now, now.
5950345	5950886	Now, now.
5951587	5954011	Don't get angry just because you entered a Max Remix.
5954231	5954511	Angel!
5956420	5962782	Good beats and stuff in there, but it's Max, and I'm not... I don't know.
5962962	5969644	I just... I can't deal with regular Max or whatever, so... I'll be nice and give it a 7.
5970524	5977006	You know, if you wanted to make a good mix, you could do, like, Legend of Butt or something.
5977306	5982248	I love the fact that three of us said, it's a good remix, but it's Max.
5983848	5984849	You know, you people...
5985669	5988531	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, Drew, Carameldansen
6013783	6019665	I have no doubt you made a better remix than this other guy, but I want Max... I want... You know what?
6020925	6021705	You know what we should do?
6022345	6025626	I want to get DJ Paranoia on the show, and I think we could arrange it.
6026526	6031487	And I want him to say on air that they will ban Max remixes from the Stepmania catalog.
6032148	6035288	I don't know what we have to do to him to get him to do that, but I think we need that to happen.
6036689	6037569	Do you think that's possible?
6038569	6041310	That if the name Max is in the title of the song, it's banned.
6042009	6045152	We have to curse him.
6045833	6046733	We'll have to do something.
6047054	6048715	I'm going to see if I can get a hold of him.
6049416	6052779	I don't know what we have to bribe him with, but I want it done.
6052939	6054721	Ice cream!
6054921	6056202	Ice cream is a winner.
6056222	6057523	We can send him lots of ice cream.
6057824	6058624	Lots of ice cream.
6059205	6062288	It means my song will still be on there because it's named Legend of Trance.
6062808	6064390	There's no Max in the title at all.
6065428	6069389	We'll send Girl Scout cookies to Boaz.
6069409	6070809	I'm seriously going to get in touch with him.
6071429	6071910	We'll see.
6071930	6073890	We'll send him Girl Scouts to service him.
6074310	6077531	All right, let's recap the songs you can vote for tonight.
6077611	6079871	Song number one, Yoko Kono.
6080351	6082172	Sorry, I almost said like Yoko Ono.
6082632	6084432	Yoko Kono.
6085293	6086933	Yoko Kono with Rise.
6094457	6097960	Song number two, Britney Spears, Every Time, the Valentin remix.
6106586	6111030	And song number three you can vote for tonight is Maximum GX with The Legend of Trance, 2005.
6111090	6111330	Maximum GX
6120558	6123061	Place vote now!
6123221	6132550	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote for song number one, song number two, or song number three.
6133171	6134852	So, um, send a private message.
6134892	6138916	Remember, if you post your, um, vote publicly in the chat room, that's great.
6138977	6141179	You'll be trying to swear, uh, swear, swear,
6141559	6143421	Sway other people to vote the way you would.
6143921	6146303	However, it doesn't count unless I get it in private message.
6146323	6150848	So if you're not sure how to send a private message, just ask nicely and somebody in the chatroom will fill you in.
6150868	6152429	That's why we have a whole little op team.
6152829	6153890	Your ops will help you out.
6154371	6161477	Alright, this is usually the part of the show where I ask Loki what the hell's going on in the sim scene besides unnecessary Max remixes.
6161918	6163399	But I know there's quite a bit going on this week.
6163419	6165661	There's some very colorful things going on.
6165701	6166302	So what's up?
6167785	6175771	Well, first off, I'd like to mention there's a comment thing under DJ Pato's new remix, which is Max Life Superior Cancer Mix.
6176191	6179453	I don't know what the fuck that is, but I love his comment.
6179493	6181215	This is the best, like, comment right here.
6181595	6186458	It says, Alex Calderia and Badass, they must meet to eat shit.
6188199	6192743	I don't know what that means, but the whole quote, they must meet to eat shit, is funny.
6193083	6193403	I don't know.
6193603	6194544	But anyways, um...
6195552	6196072	I digress.
6196813	6198133	No, but April Fool's Day.
6199274	6204497	You're only a fool if you didn't download these packs because there are so many being released it's not even funny.
6205097	6211321	We have the release of D3 Mix 2, which is just another DDR, like, you know, food mix type thing.
6211341	6213002	Nice little 186 meg file there.
6213022	6213342	We had LFT Mix 2.
6220246	6228371	All of these are just like Food Mix.
6228391	6230913	Strawberry Steps actually has the videos just like Food Mix.
6231593	6236357	All really good stuff to download to at least play while you're waiting for Food Mix 2 to come out.
6236517	6237718	So, check those out.
6237738	6242061	If you're looking for links, there's a whole thread on Bomani Style under the
6242681	6253509	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6270911	6274094	A lot better than ours, like most everything else.
6274114	6276696	So that's what's going on.
6276956	6279278	Oh, and DDRUK, I mentioned they were coming up April 1st.
6279819	6281580	There was an April Fool's joke, sort of.
6281720	6282261	They're coming up.
6283181	6285463	They're actually launching Monday.
6285924	6288706	So look for DDRUK to come in back.
6289887	6294191	Wasn't their April Fool's joke something about, oh, Konami supports us now, like any of us would believe that?
6294881	6301944	No, their actual April Fool's joke was they were going to be Dancing Stage Fusion UK or something like that.
6302624	6303505	It was for a little bit.
6303585	6304305	It was really stupid.
6306006	6307106	So that was up there.
6307606	6310588	But as far as I'm aware, they didn't do an April Fool's thing.
6310868	6314029	Probably because last year was kind of retarded, but I don't know.
6315029	6318751	So yeah, DDRUK is coming up tomorrow, supposedly.
6319844	6325390	Well, at least their joke wasn't something really stupid like getting bought by another media corporation or something.
6325410	6326411	That would just be stupid.
6326531	6327972	So at least it was Konami.
6330014	6332537	Yeah, that would suck.
6335599	6340102	So, yeah, nothing really going on in the sim scene other than, you know, more Max remixes that suck.
6340722	6345564	But, you know, I've got to put a new one out every now and then just because, you know, I... I don't know.
6346304	6357790	I've been trying to make some other stuff, but, you know, this song... Usually, when I make stuff, it's usually to make something that's better than someone else's stuff, so... Blame it on them.
6357830	6361471	If they wouldn't put the stupid sim files out, I wouldn't get inspiration to make another Max remix.
6362352	6362952	It's all their fault.
6364957	6377065	I'm going to write him an email as soon as this show's over and say, we want to interview you, we want to talk to you about a very serious issue facing the Mimani community and then spring it that we want to ban Max Remixes.
6377986	6382849	And we need his help because that site only perpetuates, encourages people to make Max Remixes.
6383558	6384798	What about Paranoia remixes?
6385939	6386419	You know what?
6386479	6389880	I haven't had my limit of that yet, although I'm getting very close.
6389960	6396262	You know, in a perfect world, we would ban Max remixes, Paranoia remixes, and there's another one.
6396642	6396842	Huh?
6397122	6397402	Drop?
6397542	6398282	No, not Dropout.
6398302	6399703	There's another one that needs to be stopped.
6400543	6405184	Sakura?
6405225	6405665	Sakura.
6406125	6408786	Well, Sakura's kind of another version of Max 300, though.
6409026	6410606	But Sakura is awesome.
6411466	6412067	The original?
6412547	6412727	Yes.
6412747	6413407	But not remixes.
6414284	6426893	I haven't really heard too many remixes, but nothing could... You know, I can't really consider Sakura a version of Max 300 just because it's so awesome on its own, but... Only because it shares an entire bass line for Max 300?
6427894	6431856	But it has the other... that makes it instantly cool.
6431876	6432757	Ah, whatever.
6433117	6437901	They're gonna make Banjo 300 or something like that, and they'll just have a banjo over the... That would be awesome!
6437981	6438381	Banjo 300!
6438421	6439302	I thought of it.
6439322	6439502	Bag.
6441576	6445539	Now, you don't hear a whole lot of bag remixes, but people that try to remix it try to be funny.
6445639	6446860	Usually it's like Bag Survivor.
6447960	6450022	Anything with Survivor in the title.
6450262	6450722	That's it.
6451323	6452504	Anything with Survivor.
6453364	6455125	Unless it's the Destiny's Child song.
6455145	6457607	And even then, I think somebody already did it, so we don't need any more.
6457727	6458648	So, that's it.
6459769	6461470	Unless maybe you're going to do Eye of the Tiger.
6461590	6462591	I don't know if anybody's done that.
6462851	6463691	That might be okay.
6464172	6466994	But I want all cowgirl Survivor.
6467998	6471545	TheSevenJump, Survivor, LetThemMove, Survivor, I want that shit stopped.
6476855	6479501	Let me just point out, and to further...
6480836	6482978	Rob's argument about bad Max remixes.
6482998	6489183	Let me just read to you the latest Max remixes that are being released right now.
6489203	6502754	We have Max Borg Assimilation, Max Life Superior Cancer Mix, The Legend of Max OTLK Version, Max Unlimited, Sakura Max Unlimited 300, Max Fantasia Version 3, meaning there's been two more before that.
6503174	6509660	Max 300, The Wacko Reflex Remix, Paranoid Survivor Max, Max Energy High Voltage Remix,
6510680	6519848	Unlimited Legends of Max Version 2, Max Extension, 2 Max 330 And that, now I'm going to cut you off right there because that is just in the past week.
6520468	6521689	That's just in the past week.
6523491	6524972	Fucking stop, people.
6526213	6526853	Seriously.
6528535	6531917	And then like you go into the week before, Love Love Shine Survivor Max.
6531957	6532918	Yeah, just what we needed.
6533539	6533659	Ass.
6536727	6539931	We'll get to the cage match winner in a little bit, but first we're going to go to a quickie break.
6541493	6543716	And in this break, Max remixes!
6544157	6544798	No, just kidding.
6545419	6549965	We're going to do, I don't know, I want to do a song that really doesn't suck.
6550065	6552889	What's a song like that just doesn't suck?
6554161	6554741	From what?
6556203	6557223	How about the original Sakura?
6557263	6557804	We can do the original.
6557824	6558324	Yeah, play Sakura.
6558344	6559085	Alright, we'll do that.
6560286	6565750	Even though it's kind of Max, but you're right, it's got the extra something something that makes it a little better.
6566390	6567071	We'll do Zenon.
6567551	6567971	I like that.
6568031	6569132	Okay, I'm liking these ideas.
6570073	6571554	So, we will be back after this.
6573764	6577088	I'm having trouble locating the Sakura file.
6577128	6579751	I know I have it somewhere.
6580531	6581773	Don't forget you can visit our website.
6581793	6584476	We have the webcam over at www.orangeonline.com.
6584496	6589261	Of course, there's not a whole lot interesting on webcam tonight because we don't have quite a full studio as we sometimes do.
6589641	6593325	But you'll catch one of us dancing in front of it once in a while, so it's definitely worth checking out.
6594206	6595387	Also, the chat room, of course.
6596508	6604943	Alright, we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio and we got the FUs of the week coming up at some point and we might have to do some kind of game tonight.
6605424	6607106	We'll have to do some type of game or something as well.
6607167	6608389	So we'll be back after this.
6653947	6654480	Thanks for watching!
6710242	6711624	Thank you for watching!
6764852	6765674	Thanks for watching!
6824645	6825487	Thank you for watching!
7022757	7027645	From the Step Squad to Orange Lab, this PDR sucks!
7027705	7028226	Holla!
7028246	7028426	P-T-P-O
7036618	7039120	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
7039180	7045885	In that break, you heard a little bit of Sakura, followed by Zenon, R3, and Innocent Walls, both by request from the chat.
7046185	7049808	Actually, the chat just said, play something Taku, so I picked one we hadn't played in a while.
7049828	7052170	Taku makes me all flush.
7052250	7054211	Or as you said in the chat room, Taku is sex.
7054651	7054872	Yes.
7054952	7059675	Which is funny because then someone said, you know what, Jamie, you always come in here and you just say something is sex, and then you leave.
7061737	7062978	I am not obsessed.
7064318	7068821	No, you're not necessarily saying taco sex, but you go in there and you'll be like, gorillas are sex.
7069062	7071643	Or, you know, like, Orange Sounds Radio is sex.
7071984	7074566	Or, you know, Splenda is sex.
7074586	7076727	I don't know what... Splenda is sweet.
7077107	7077808	Splenda is sweet.
7078248	7080110	But, you know, you'll go in there, oh my god, that's sex.
7080410	7082071	You know, it's like me and that's hot.
7082632	7084133	Like, you know... That hot.
7084693	7085113	That's hot.
7085133	7087135	We need to tell them the story of that hot.
7088487	7106412	The story of That Hot, there was a gentleman on Phantasy Star Online, well, I'm saying that nicely about him, who would always, he kept trying to say That's Hot, and he's not originally an English speaker, and it was very obvious, so he would refer to everything as That Hot.
7106973	7109813	And the phrase just kept carrying on and carrying on.
7110354	7111714	He's a very unique individual.
7112199	7115380	His name is Guan Li, and he lives somewhere in Minnesota.
7115720	7118021	I don't know exactly where, but I know he's in Minnesota.
7118081	7118741	Minnesota.
7119922	7122803	Alrighty, back to... Okay, that hot, that hot.
7124763	7125264	That's awesome.
7125924	7130325	I might have to start saying that, that hot, ouch, that... Or somebody in the chatroom said, ouch, that hot.
7132346	7132926	That's great.
7134227	7137968	Okay, let's find out who won tonight's cage match.
7138899	7140841	You ready to find out who won the cage match, boys and girls?
7140881	7141982	I don't care who won.
7142622	7143403	I'm fabulous.
7143963	7144524	Okay, now tell me.
7144544	7145184	Well, here it is.
7145585	7146906	The winner of tonight's cage match.
7149188	7150529	Three weeks in a row.
7150569	7151510	Woohoo!
7153251	7155253	Yoko Kanno with Rise.
7155353	7156494	You know what that means, boys and girls.
7156614	7160918	Next week, Yoko Kanno is going for retirement.
7161479	7167163	That'll only be, if it gets retired next week, it'll be the third track in Orange Lounge history to get retired.
7167503	7171466	Behind Echo Image with Comeback and Gwen Stefani with What You Waitin' For.
7171647	7172988	Yoko Kanno is awesome.
7173028	7179172	How Gwen Stefani made it four weeks with a bunch of top 40 haters, I will never understand, but it really did.
7179532	7181654	People had no taste and voted for the sellout.
7183395	7185997	Alright, so there it is, Yoko Kanno with Rise.
7186518	7190941	Next week is the retirement week, so Loki, you and I are going to have to bring out the big guns.
7192555	7193836	Oh, man, I have to bring girls back.
7195236	7196097	Oh, wait, that sounds like big guns.
7196737	7197418	Dear God, no.
7197478	7199459	Great, so it's all going to come down to me, apparently.
7200499	7202920	I will have to find the perfect song.
7204101	7206962	I know something that they'll vote for every time, so I'll bring it.
7208863	7211445	I'm like, what echo image do I have that we haven't put in yet?
7211485	7211785	Let's see.
7212998	7213659	AYUMI HOMOSAKI
7225908	7226308	EZ Breezy
7255968	7256569	You know what?
7256929	7257109	What?
7257149	7263854	I need to send you one of her and... Shoot, who was it?
7264154	7266136	It's some rapper chick.
7266176	7269118	It was off of the Rush Hour 2 soundtrack.
7270018	7270719	Blow My Whistle.
7272156	7274157	Uh, uh, blow my whistle, I don't know who did that.
7274177	7276418	It's like one of her... Missy Elliot or something, or, I don't know.
7276818	7279419	No, I don't think so, but it was one of her first English ones.
7279699	7281960	Oh, okay, oh, it's a Japanese.
7282700	7283100	I'm sorry.
7283821	7284461	I thought you just said it.
7284501	7285601	Yeah, it's Itada Hikaru.
7286082	7286202	Oh!
7286942	7287702	Oh, I didn't know it was her.
7288002	7288723	Yeah, I'll find it.
7288943	7291644	It's one of her early all-English ones.
7291984	7293124	Oh, I'll have to find it.
7294005	7294205	Alright.
7296426	7296526	Um...
7297580	7303525	Moving on, I thought we could get into the DDR Freak Post of the Week.
7305421	7306201	We appreciate your loyalty.
7332057	7335538	You can catch it the week after on DDR Freak.
7335558	7340339	When I say the week after, I mean this Friday's show will actually be last Sunday's show.
7340379	7342379	It's kind of like a week gap.
7342519	7344080	I don't know why it is that way, but it just is.
7344400	7347341	I think that's to give us a little bit of a buffer should we miss a week or something.
7347401	7349641	It's to save our butt a little bit, so we'll see.
7350321	7353142	Anyway, let's get into the DDR Freak post of the week.
7357911	7363375	I have a tie for the DDR Freak Post of the Week this week, because there's two really, really good ones.
7363896	7365377	So we're going to start off with this one.
7365417	7372942	It's a thread, and it was created in DDR Chit Chat, which is the home of great DDR Freak Posts of the Week.
7373002	7373943	We love our spam.
7375344	7382550	This post was by a BASIC member, and the subject is New Religion, Anti-DDR Forever.
7383868	7390193	And the post reads, join my friends, new religion, anti-DDR forever.
7390813	7394696	It's Christian based, but it says that DDR is a sin.
7395216	7398298	He has added an extra commandment, no DDR.
7398359	7403102	By the way, commandment was spelled without a D. So he added an extra commandment, no DDR.
7409264	7410005	That's the post.
7410505	7411786	It's Christian-based!
7413127	7415128	But they've added an extra commandment.
7417409	7422733	They should meet... Rob, that earns a yay.
7422773	7423673	He's a demo bass.
7424094	7425234	He's a demo mouse.
7425775	7427116	No, but this is the funny thing.
7427156	7429857	This is what makes the post more hilarious than anything.
7430738	7433980	Is the signature says... This is the guy's signature.
7435121	7436762	I'm single and it sucks.
7438528	7440409	I wonder why!
7440429	7443792	Who didn't think that?
7443952	7449918	Like, seriously, I would like to know, was there anybody in the chatroom when I said, I'm single and it sucks, is this guy's signature?
7449958	7454602	Is there anybody in the chatroom, anybody out there listening that didn't think, I wonder why?
7455282	7455943	I have to know.
7457124	7460787	Probably the third post down.
7460807	7462428	Uh, the third post down, oh yes.
7462448	7462829	Four is amazing.
7464388	7468570	Somebody above it said, WTF, you're either a complete idiot or just a terrible troll.
7468610	7469411	I'm guessing the latter.
7469771	7471592	And then the next person said, I'm guessing both.
7473053	7473794	And then this is great.
7474194	7480318	Somebody else jumps in there and says, Ah, and using the Lord's name in vain like you did in one of your other posts is not a sin?
7481599	7482120	Oh, snap.
7484021	7485442	Somebody totally served that guy.
7485482	7487743	I need this thread, though, because I have to look at something on it.
7488204	7489224	Actually, it was locked.
7490025	7490045	I...
7491929	7495091	Oh, okay.
7495111	7497733	Do you want me to link the whole chatroom to that, or just you?
7497773	7499054	Yeah, link the chatroom to that.
7499395	7499915	There you go.
7499935	7501996	Have fun with that, you guys, although the post is locked.
7502016	7503297	You can't follow up on that anymore.
7504738	7505019	Alright.
7506360	7506660	Let's see.
7506820	7511604	One other post, because one DDR Freak post of the week is just not enough.
7511624	7513885	There were too many good posts this week, so we have another one here.
7514786	7514886	Um...
7516630	7536617	and it's actually not a brand new topic but it was posted in an existing thread and it's in the red octane ignition version 2.0 thread and this is post number 182 and this is what's great is that you get to see what happens when DDR Freak filters take over here's the post
7538197	7543124	Looks like after Frick two weeks of use, this pad is already starting to give out.
7543425	7546249	Here come the Frick random goods on 7-footers.
7546389	7550014	Frick worthless piece of $100 garbage poopy buttocks Frick.
7550982	7562547	After a frustrating B-score on A-heavy, I threw the Frick pad on the floor and punched the living Frick out of it, and then I grabbed the cord and smacked it on across my wall, breaking the Xbox piece off.
7562888	7569751	Frick, piece of garbage poopy, don't Frick buy this red-ock tank and Frick suck my penis, then vomit and eat that too.
7577821	7578821	I love the filters.
7578941	7580941	I really do love the filters on DDR Freak.
7581061	7584822	That, you know, that makes the whole post right there.
7584942	7589763	Don't frick buy this red octane, can frick suck my penis and vomit and eat that too.
7591643	7595684	It's like a really bad version of DDR Mad Libs or something.
7596464	7599365	Oh man, go the filters, that's funny.
7601758	7605339	I don't stand for censorship in the chat room.
7617125	7617445	All right.
7619287	7624250	If you have a suggestion for DDR Freak Post of the Week, you can always send me a private message on DDR Freak.
7624290	7625912	My name is Sky, S-K-I-E.
7626252	7627673	And actually, some folks have done that.
7627713	7631536	We actually had, I think last week or two weeks ago, was a user-submitted Post of the Week.
7631936	7632677	So send those over.
7632937	7633878	But please remember...
7634598	7641504	If you see mental retardation going on on DDR Freak, and it's not somebody who is actually mentally retarded, because that would be okay.
7641584	7643746	That's okay if somebody actually is mentally retarded.
7644146	7648710	But if somebody is acting mentally retarded, you need to PM a moderator so they can lock the thread.
7649030	7649310	Yes.
7650291	7651612	Look, you know one.
7651732	7652232	Hi.
7652493	7653654	Send me a private message.
7653714	7656416	I'll make sure you're taken care of.
7657451	7657972	Oh, I'm sorry.
7657992	7663016	They wanted a link to that post as well with the Frick Eat My Vomit 2 one.
7664077	7664817	I'll find it, guys.
7664877	7665858	I'll post it in chat.
7668000	7668480	Oh, I found it.
7668500	7668781	There it is.
7669061	7672243	Remember, guys, it's post 182 in the thread.
7672283	7673364	It's a very large thread.
7673785	7674945	So have fun with that.
7675606	7675886	All right.
7679789	7682672	You know, there is a way you can get around those filters if you're smart.
7683280	7684200	Yeah, but we're not going to tell you.
7684220	7687641	Yeah, I'm not going to tell you, but it's not that hard to figure out, just, you know.
7688501	7690381	You just have to be bold about doing it, that's all.
7693082	7694002	Wah, wah, wah!
7694262	7694802	Alright, anyway.
7700183	7701824	What, it wasn't funny when I read it?
7701924	7704564	No, but it made me laugh again the second time.
7704604	7708705	Because of all the caps and stuff, like it goes from caps to lower the caps, it's just funny.
7709523	7713887	and I quote, Poopy Buttocks Frick.
7716489	7716789	Alright.
7721634	7724836	Let's see, what else are we going to get into here news-wise?
7725277	7728780	I thought there was some other news that needed some talking about here this week.
7730922	7732323	There's something going on.
7733806	7745929	You know, we've got our podcast that goes on, and you can download that from our website, www.orangelandtrader.com, and click on To Go, and that's where you can figure out what's going on with the rest of the gaming world.
7746269	7756032	We've kind of started to expand to talk a little bit more about the general gaming world here on this program, but, you know, we talk a lot about other stuff on the other program.
7756852	7763016	You know, somebody was asking in the chat room earlier, what happened with DDR featuring Mario?
7763937	7768500	And that was a good question because we haven't heard a whole lot about DDR featuring Mario lately.
7768880	7775025	So I kind of decided, hey, as long as I'm on DDR Freak making fun of people, maybe I'll go and actually get a useful thread.
7775705	7775845	And...
7777415	7783420	I went to check out what's going on on the DDR GameCube thread, and there's really not a whole lot going on right now.
7784341	7792047	Apparently there might be screenshots in GMR magazine, but there's nothing really super official that has been announced yet.
7794529	7804077	And then rumor is that screenshots for the pad have come out recently, but nothing super duper official that we haven't already seen as of yet.
7806259	7808461	That answers the DDR Featuring Mario question as well.
7811403	7814165	I guess what we're going to do now is we're going to go ahead and get a little bit angsty.
7814626	7827677	So if you guys want to go ahead and submit some FUs of the week to my private inbox there in the chatroom, just send me a private message, we will start to get angsty with a little segment we call the FUs of the week.
7827757	7831921	And Jamie, why is it that we have to do the FUs of the week every single freaking week?
7833066	7834507	Because the world sucks!
7834527	7835829	This world is bullshit!
7840774	7842956	Oh, this is bad.
7843016	7844658	Here is justice.
7844698	7846139	Here is punishment.
7846319	7849442	Here is... This is fucked up!
7851044	7855568	I F you to my busy, busy, busy, busy, busy... Did I say busy?
7855628	7856229	Schedule.
7856629	7856950	Okay?
7858448	7860329	I work all the damn time.
7860549	7866813	I go to the gym, I go to school, and then by the time I get home, I'm too damn tired to do anything else.
7867433	7872436	Except work on, you know, whatever projects I happen to have going on.
7873277	7882022	Big F you to putting a lot of hard work into something and then not having it recognized.
7882990	7887814	And that's happened several times over the past week, so I've been kind of, eh.
7887834	7896803	F you to my driver's side window for randomly becoming detached from the mechanism that holds it up and rolling itself down.
7897103	7899745	Creating a loud whistling noise not unlike that heard in a hurricane.
7900226	7900926	Really aggravating.
7900946	7909294	When I'm trying to listen to my good music really, really loud in my little, you know, 93 Tercel, my speakers are bad enough as it is.
7911558	7915980	F you to the person who was going 10 miles under the speed limit when I'm trying to go 20 over.
7916000	7920741	I hope that no CHP people are listening to that.
7921501	7925783	And a big F you to myself for not being able to decide on what my next hair color should be.
7926023	7927423	Maybe I should leave that to the chat room.
7929244	7933425	Find me a haircut and find me a hair color because I'm getting damn tired of what I have now.
7934985	7936706	And a big F you toward...
7939173	7942414	Having people not recognize how much of a fabulous celebrity I am.
7943414	7943755	I'm done.
7944455	7945195	Thanks.
7946776	7947996	Loki, it's all you.
7950797	7955738	Okay, first off, fuck you to goddamn me hitting a car.
7955939	7957179	That fucking sucked.
7958259	7963461	And you know, that just totally put a big, huge roadblock in my perfect weekend.
7964161	7965401	So, fuck you to that.
7966722	7975165	Also, fuck the fact that Mitch Hedberg had to die because he was touring with Stephen Lynch and that would have been an awesome show to see.
7975725	7977246	Now I just have to settle for Stephen Lynch.
7977746	7978046	Oh well.
7980667	7987069	And fuck you to the Pope for not dying fast enough for me to make a joke about him on April Fool's Day.
7987577	7990798	God damn it, you know, he was just clinging to life and he just needed to die.
7991279	7992319	Just die quick.
7992339	7993179	We knew he was going.
7993199	7994460	They already read him his last rites.
7994520	7997201	It was kind of like, okay, yep, we're just waiting for him to stop breathing.
7997361	7997741	Okay.
7998522	7999742	I mean, they weren't even trying.
7999802	8001223	He was just like, you know, dying.
8001763	8003044	So, to hell with him.
8003244	8003604	And, um...
8004704	8007406	Also, um, I know I had some other ones.
8007807	8014211	Oh, once again, fuck you to me for hitting that car, um, only because the car was an SUV being driven by women.
8014351	8018834	And you know how I say women drivers, women who drive SUVs fucking suck.
8019715	8024638	There's a big, you know, bit of irony for me, so, um, oh well.
8025539	8033244	I, I live, last accident I've been in was like seven years ago anyway, so, and this is like, not even, doesn't even really even qualify as an accident, so it's,
8033484	8034985	All things just keep getting better
8059183	8065769	Uh, F you to the fact that there's been so much death in the media lately, like between that chicken Florida and the Pope.
8066070	8067711	I'm sick of hearing about people dying.
8068252	8070554	Let's hear about something happy once in a while.
8070634	8073296	I want to hear about Disneyland getting a new ride or something.
8074017	8078521	So, just, God, find something happy to report on once in a while, you guys.
8078701	8079142	Dang.
8080123	8080223	Um...
8081855	8089617	An F you to PSPs for costing so much money.
8090298	8092498	An F you to work drama I had on Friday.
8092518	8093399	Nothing terrible.
8094139	8096259	I was an angsty little man on Friday.
8096599	8103021	And I didn't participate in April Fool's Day as much as I wanted to because of things that were going on on Friday.
8103582	8105782	I hate it when things put me in a bad mood like that.
8109104	8116009	and then F you to the fact that I think my car needs repairs because I don't like having to pay for that stuff.
8116289	8116810	I'm sorry.
8117010	8117991	That's alright, it's not your fault.
8118051	8119932	Unless you were the one that broke my car, then it is your fault.
8120913	8121634	No, I didn't.
8121894	8122754	Alright, that's good.
8123695	8128959	And then also F you, lastly, F you to the House of Wax for having Paris Hilton in it.
8129139	8129680	That's not hot.
8131206	8131986	Hey, what if she dies?
8132487	8139990	You know what, and that's what I was saying, since she doesn't have top billing, she's likely to be an extra character that gets offed in the movie, so that would be worth seeing.
8140491	8144733	And notice in the trailer, the first thing that they show her is making a sex tape.
8145513	8146954	Oh, but I'm sure that's supposed to be funny!
8147234	8148194	Nope, sorry.
8150115	8150716	Comedy.
8151956	8157459	Let's go to the rest of the room here and get their FUs, starting off with DDR Angel, and then over to Julie.
8159608	8169729	I've been to myself not finding the change of Kalathia disc sooner because, uh, yeah, I, I, uh, inadvertently jinxed Sky over here to, uh...
8170532	8173374	Let Me Borrow His, but then he couldn't find his either, so that was kind of weird.
8174715	8176757	Um, yeah, so I found him, whatever.
8177257	8188626	Um, I viewed that class getting canceled on Tuesday because I really wanted that one to work out, but hey, I guess rules are rules, and I showed up, but nobody else did, so that's kind of sad.
8190647	8191148	And, let's see.
8193101	8200144	F you to the stupid person who on the way here tried to cut me off and made me go all the way around.
8210337	8212218	FU to my schedule, I agree with that.
8212659	8215120	And FU, I agree with all the people dying.
8215140	8218381	There was a poke out on the anniversary of my cat's death, which was kind of interesting.
8219462	8223544	And, by the way, at Disneyland, there is something happy going on on May 5th.
8223564	8225485	They're doing their big anniversary celebration.
8225525	8226485	That needs to be in the news.
8226525	8227726	I'm sick of all the death, too.
8227866	8228466	There we go.
8228566	8232088	See, I want to hear about happy children partying at Disneyland.
8232928	8234749	And then getting blown away with bombs.
8234809	8235289	No, I'm kidding.
8235509	8235869	I'm kidding.
8235909	8236770	I'm not that sadistic.
8238858	8240999	All righty, and I guess that's the end of my FU for today.
8241279	8241619	All right.
8244080	8245621	I do like what the chat room is saying, though.
8245661	8249743	They're suggesting that there be a Kingdom Hearts ride added at Disneyland.
8249763	8250983	That would be hot.
8252044	8252684	That hot.
8253865	8254425	That hot.
8254765	8255145	That hot.
8257133	8261177	Great, you can tell Guan that he's infected Orange Lounge Radio now.
8261677	8262578	I will let Guan know.
8262598	8265320	We're going to get a shirt with all our new catchphrases that we have invented.
8265420	8267822	DaMubAss, ThatHot, what else do we have?
8268163	8268623	Deathcake.
8269104	8269604	Deathcake.
8271005	8271406	We'll see.
8272286	8274328	You will have tea and cake with the vicar or you will die!
8275549	8276130	The new one.
8277231	8278852	They need to meet and eat poop.
8279192	8279873	Or eat shit.
8281454	8283156	The one that was from DJ Pato's thing.
8285325	8294491	I still go with Poopy Buttocks Frick Frick Poopy Eat My Penis and Vomit 2 or whatever the hell that said You know what our shirt should be?
8294531	8312163	It should just be a bunch of DDR Freak posts No, we just need the shirt that says OLR That Hot OLR That Hot That would be just fabulous I like that idea, we'll have to see Anyway, let's get to the chatroom FUs, shall we?
8314844	8318367	Thank you, Captain Jack, who's going to be walking us through the chatroom FUs.
8321310	8325773	I don't think you can pronounce this all one word, and if I... Is this... I don't know.
8326374	8329797	Lxldubes, we'll say that.
8329937	8330798	Lxldubes.
8331658	8332359	Lixldubes?
8332419	8332719	I don't know.
8332819	8339105	Lxldubes says, I need to send an FU to Resident Evil 4 for making me kill Spanish-speaking monsters.
8339605	8340226	What's next?
8340326	8341367	Lawn-mowing aliens?
8344139	8351724	Illusion says, F you to myself for falling asleep before Robot Chicken last week and TorrentBox for not having the file up for me to download.
8352145	8353426	Fuck the cunt of Russia.
8355987	8362372	Oh, and here's me plugging www.cynictaxi.co.nr.
8362752	8364733	Cynical articles and general wackiness.
8365514	8367255	Just search for Robot Chicken Torrents.
8367355	8369857	It's not on TorrentBox, but I found it, so it's out there.
8373197	8381847	DJ Tyrant says, F you to having to play Levin in the first round of RGC F you to school, F you to the in the group screen at Electric Avenue
8383049	8386231	John Field says, F you to running out of space again in my computer.
8386792	8387552	I can't believe it.
8387632	8392516	I'm at 773.17 gigabytes and I've used almost all of it up again.
8395258	8399741	I just bought that 400 gig hard drive in January.
8400161	8402203	I really need cheap terabyte drives.
8402723	8407287	Also, F you to this stupid RAID card that crashes my computer randomly and unrecoverably.
8408207	8410808	F you to turning my room into the pigsty that it is now.
8411328	8412849	F you to not enough hours in the week.
8413009	8414890	Oh, and F you to daylight savings time.
8414950	8415990	Why does this exist?
8416610	8417191	Thank you.
8417371	8417891	Oh, my God.
8417971	8419371	I completely forgot.
8419772	8423133	A giant F you to daylight savings time.
8423153	8426354	Because of daylight savings time, I didn't get to bed until 6 in the morning today.
8427475	8428035	That's bad.
8429451	8430672	I mean, five in the morning is pretty bad.
8430692	8431732	Six in the morning, really bad.
8431992	8435054	So, you know, just F you to daylight savings time.
8435434	8435874	I hate you.
8436154	8436554	Please die.
8436875	8438135	Why do we have daylight savings time?
8438155	8439536	Somebody told me it's a farmer's thing.
8439936	8444158	That they did it so that farmers could get up at a reasonable hour and tend to the crops.
8445119	8445559	You know what?
8446519	8446799	Julie?
8447340	8452362	Yeah, it was due because there was some votes and actually there's some areas in the United States that don't actually observe it.
8453303	8458145	It's because they were mad that parents were having their kids walk to school while it was dark.
8458769	8460711	The farm thing I'm not doubting is true as well.
8460991	8462032	Get the kid a flashlight.
8462593	8463093	I agree.
8463153	8463814	Get the kid a gun.
8463834	8464735	I totally agree with that.
8464875	8468418	I dig daylight savings time, though, because then I get to drive to work in the dark again.
8469580	8470160	It weirds me out.
8470180	8472422	Because I get to drive to work at 6 a.m.
8472462	8473003	in the morning.
8473443	8475365	Who lets their kids walk to school anyways?
8476887	8483293	Honestly, I mean, buses pick up any kids that are, like, one mile, you know, further away, I mean.
8484542	8485422	Who gives a shit?
8485502	8488483	Most people don't walk anyways, and the people that do walk, oh no.
8488803	8492205	Yeah, because you know all those muggers out there that want to steal their kids' lunch money.
8492765	8493205	Woo!
8493925	8501168	Seriously, and in this part of town where I'm from, like, you know, all the 16-year-olds have SUVs anyway, and they're all driving to school, so, whatever.
8501288	8501808	Anyway, sorry.
8501948	8502848	Let's get back to the FUs.
8505029	8510191	Ranma says, fuck you to the city of Boston for not having beer.
8511389	8515692	ARG, we had to travel out in the suburbs for it, and the liquor stores close at 9.
8516612	8518813	Fuck this nonsensical Puritan bullshit.
8518873	8519654	Fuck Boston.
8520054	8521715	Oh yeah, fuck Red Sox, go Yanks.
8522015	8523536	Oh god, he's gonna start that on this show.
8524717	8527859	SSJ100Matt says, F you to DVD Studio Pro.
8528199	8532281	The programs keep crashing in my class, thus taking forever to finish my final project.
8532942	8538445	F you to me for taking forever to get out of the 7 and 8 step range in DDR.
8538465	8540286	3 to 5 months and counting.
8541949	8545732	FU to the Farley Brothers and Jimmy Fallon for making the Boston Red Sox movie.
8547873	8551836	Ninst says, FU to the place I ordered my PS2 flip-top from.
8552216	8554738	It's two weeks late and I can't get a hold of anyone from the company.
8555098	8556439	I want to play 2DX already.
8556519	8557920	Enjoy the disputed charge.
8558960	8560582	FU two of the guys I work with.
8560602	8562743	They are complete idiots and they never shut the hell up.
8562943	8563924	FU to Snow in April.
8565543	8574769	Dark Knight says, my FU goes to the screw up my job did when I got paid this weekend instead of taking 40 bucks out of my check to help me pay my taxes off from 01.
8575630	8580053	They took the whole amount that I owe, which leaves me with nothing for two whole weeks.
8580973	8586477	An FU to employees who don't know when to keep their hands to themselves, especially when they try to steal from the store.
8587258	8587638	Genius.
8589119	8598946	RPGKing7 says, my two FUs of the week are FU to not being able to get some alone time with my girlfriend and FU to missing my best friend of seven years who left for the Canadian Navy.
8599466	8603970	Oh, and fuck you to the end of the Beck Mongolian Chop Squad anime.
8604050	8605190	It should go on forever.
8605751	8611215	And lastly, Flerone, FU to Dizzy from Guilty Gear XX not having an insta-kill.
8611755	8614977	Boss I know with heal without an insta-kill?
8615498	8615878	No thanks.
8617591	8617931	That's it.
8619212	8619593	The end.
8620594	8623016	Thank you for playing the FUs of the Week.
8645694	8647636	We'll have something fun to talk about.
8647696	8651621	We need more of your karaoke revolution skills.
8653643	8654844	Oh, come on, be our diva.
8654904	8664274	By the way, I've got to bring that to work, actually, karaoke revolution and DDR, because apparently the blockbuster, and they don't do this blockbuster sort of...
8666184	8669807	I don't really want to say the convention, like sales conference type thing that's in Texas.
8670727	8675270	And they're bringing DDR and Kuroki Revolution to play.
8675711	8677972	So they want to try it out here to see what it is.
8678733	8679653	So I got to bring it in.
8680594	8680934	Yay me.
8683396	8684917	All right, we'll be back after this break.
8685217	8687038	And just so you guys know, I ain't screwing with you.
8687238	8689040	I'm starting off this break with some erotic.
8689320	8691621	So we better start seeing some good questions for Ask Orange Lounge.
8691641	8692582	We'll be back after this.
8700711	8714129	You hear the priest that's trying to keep this god asleep Love's shining eternally, love will make you feel so free Come on girl, it's okay for satisfaction You must break the flame of passion In the blood that's shining in the temple of love

8867822	8868786	Thanks for watching!
8899103	8900226	Thanks for watching!
8956776	8957404	Thanks for watching!
8986618	8990199	Come on, come on, do the locomotion with me.
8990219	8993761	Locomotion, come on, you got the notion.
8993901	8997062	Locomotion, do it back, yeah.
8997362	9000644	Everybody's doing a brand new dance now.
9000664	9002604	Come on, baby, do the locomotion.
9002624	9006186	I know you'll get to like it if you give it a try.
9027052	9028873	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
9067736	9082061	Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.
9082402	9087283	And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.
9088164	9094106	Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.
9094477	9101861	It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free
9124685	9126606	Let's get into some Ask Orange Lounge.
9126626	9132688	We've got some time to fill here tonight, so we're going to get into this.
9132708	9137710	And then we might try to do a little bit of news, too, if we kind of run out of questions.
9137750	9140791	But it looks like a lot of you guys have some questions you've got to know the answer to.
9142111	9142952	So we'll get into that.
9149318	9154280	Let's Ask Orange Lounge, Some Stupid Question, What Will We Find Out This Week?
9154400	9161503	On Orange Lounge Radio, you can tell that we need to fill a little time, 30 minutes to be exact.
9161523	9163344	So I hope this segment is long tonight.
9165485	9167006	It's a slow news week, what can we say?
9170767	9172248	Illusion says question.
9173652	9175314	Here is a question for Sky.
9175474	9177676	Oh God, I should have known this subject would come up tonight.
9178637	9182800	How could you not absolutely love Sin City with a passion?
9182880	9190427	He's referencing a live journal post I made earlier this week that said simply, Sin City, all style, little substance.
9191548	9195131	First, to give the point tonight, we'll do a little point counterpoint.
9195512	9197293	I will let Loki gush about Sin City.
9200016	9200136	Um.
9200714	9206137	Since it was awesome, I mean, first of all, it's very, um, stylistic.
9207058	9211661	It did have substance, it had much substance, very, very much substance.
9211681	9216404	Anyways, um, it was basically the best adaptation of a comic book that's ever been made.
9216444	9219526	They actually didn't even make a screenplay for it, it was done straight from the comic book.
9220306	9223128	Um, I loved it, actually, um...
9223939	9228762	My favorite parts were those of, I believe it was, the big fat kill was pretty good.
9229102	9231903	I liked that with all the whores with guns.
9232224	9232744	Gotta love that.
9234685	9237787	I especially loved, I believe her name was Miho or something like that.
9238247	9239107	She was badass.
9239187	9244550	I mean, that's something that Jamie would like because, I mean, totally Battle Royale-ish.
9244730	9245971	It's very awesome.
9246071	9248613	You would just be like, this chick kicks ass.
9248813	9249053	Okay.
9249073	9251114	I would recommend Jamie.
9253188	9254910	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9272509	9273690	Frodo eating the other hobbits
9300845	9305399	Frodo plus Harry Potter equals scare, seriously, because you look like Harry Potter.
9306141	9308944	Yeah, Harry Potter and Spider-Man crossed.
9309384	9311266	And, you know, throw in a little bit of cannibalism.
9311486	9313668	That would pretty much what you'd have Elijah Wood's character.
9315529	9319393	And then, Bruce Willis stuff is pretty good, too.
9320474	9322836	It's ultra-violent, very gruesome.
9322856	9325799	There were people actually walking out because they didn't realize how gruesome it was.
9325999	9329182	They saw people that were retarded, because you're always going to get the retarded people coming in.
9329542	9331564	They're bringing their kids to see this movie.
9332375	9334356	Why do you bring your kids to see this movie?
9334376	9335357	It's a rated R movie.
9335377	9336117	It's not meant for kids.
9336197	9336977	Why do you bring your kids?
9337137	9339339	Because they're stupid and don't read up on stuff to begin with.
9339359	9344381	And then later on you're going to say, Well, I think it's all about Sin City, so that's why they ripped off Mommy's arm.
9344741	9348143	And now I'm suing, you know, Miramax.
9350244	9350624	Fuck them.
9351185	9353406	It's the world of people who can't think for themselves.
9354238	9355119	All right, my turn.
9356041	9369800	I did not dislike Sin City, so I don't want to be labeled as a Sin City hater, because I did enjoy the movie, but I also do not believe that this... Like, I have seen at least three different people declare this the best movie ever made, and I definitely don't think it's the best movie ever made.
9369820	9371081	I think I'll see a better movie this year.
9372162	9373443	But it's a good movie still.
9373623	9377504	I don't really want to see it again, but I thought it was a good movie and I just recommended it to Jamie.
9377584	9381086	So, you know, I don't have bad things to say about the movie, but here were my issue with it.
9381646	9383667	It was very stylistic.
9383747	9385368	Like, it looked so sexy.
9385688	9386709	The look was so great.
9387409	9390210	The acting really ruined some of it for me.
9390290	9399234	Because you had some people that were acting one way, like kind of that, I don't know, that element of the 30s, you know, noir style.
9399254	9400435	And then some folks that just...
9401118	9403261	And I would put probably Brittany Murphy in that category.
9403281	9404903	And the chick that played...
9415287	9434103	Goldie or whatever, and the other, I don't know, there's that Goldie chick, and then, it's basically most of the women, except for the one who played like the queen whore, like she was like queen of the whores, she was badass, okay, she was pretty cool, but a lot of the acting just kind of didn't do it for me, so, that was just me.
9434523	9461552	and you know I just thought it went on like really really really long and I kinda would have thought a comic book movie would have been a little more fast-paced like there were some scenes in the movie that were very fast-paced and I was like when it was like really fast-paced I enjoyed it but a lot of it was just very like but don't get me wrong I didn't think it was bad I just didn't think it was like the oh my god greatest thing ever anyway um let's see more questions we do have more questions
9466410	9468091	You can still ask questions if you want, you guys.
9469652	9470113	Let's see.
9471414	9474317	Dark Knight wanted to follow up to something he was saying in his FU earlier.
9474357	9476759	He said something about an employee stealing from the store.
9477179	9484866	Someone got caught last night, ended up only being two cashiers that night, and I had to work in women's, so not fun.
9485727	9487828	And he's asking, so are we having a slow cam night?
9487949	9489210	Yeah, we are having a slow cam night.
9489230	9489550	Sorry, guys.
9489758	9492440	That's because our special guest is hiding from the cam.
9492480	9493922	She's stealing my shtick.
9496024	9499527	I'm supposed to be the mysterious co-host.
9500083	9507126	Here's the interesting thing is that in about two or three weeks now, we're not that far away, Orange Lounge Radio Studio is moving.
9507527	9510568	So in the new studio, the webcam will be set up completely differently.
9511268	9511989	Above my head.
9512909	9516291	It'll be interesting to see how we set it up in the new studio.
9516311	9518292	You can put it on my head and have the Sakura cam.
9518332	9521874	Well, the weird thing is we're not going to be able to do the iToy cam either, so we'll have to get creative.
9522914	9523234	Who cares?
9523294	9524375	I have another webcam.
9524435	9526136	I just don't use it because I didn't like it.
9527077	9530859	I haven't really thought the logistics of the webcam out yet, so we'll see.
9531960	9535222	Anyway, question from LXLDubes.
9536123	9538384	Why haven't we gotten Orange Lounge Radio t-shirts yet?
9539545	9540086	Pay for them.
9540966	9543368	The problem with t-shirts is that...
9544548	9548591	In order to get t-shirts, you have to buy a bunch of them up front.
9549091	9552073	And if you're not able to sell them, then you have to take a loss.
9552414	9554675	And none of us are financially able to take a loss right now.
9555076	9557517	What we may do, I do want to do t-shirts.
9557597	9561000	I think we have enough of a following where we could get enough small t-shirts.
9561380	9571547	But it would be the type of thing where it's like pre-order, and I know a lot of folks don't like the pre-order thing, but that's just so that we wouldn't lose any money, you know, and we'd only order enough shirts for those that would pre-order it.
9571827	9581094	So if we do do shirts in the future, which we are wanting to do before E3, so you may see this coming in the next month, it would probably be something where it's pre-order only.
9581534	9587058	But we'll post more details to the website when we know more information.
9588600	9590081	We also have to get some shirt designs.
9590141	9591462	We don't know exactly what we want right now.
9591602	9592663	OLR that hot?
9592723	9593343	That's pretty good.
9593524	9594124	That hot.
9595345	9595705	We'll see.
9600028	9600348	Excuse me.
9600448	9609254	MPQ wants to know, What should I do if my Beatmania 2DX arrives before my flip-top PS2 does?
9610575	9611175	Wait longer.
9611816	9614017	You shouldn't have bought a modded PS2 to begin with.
9614477	9615238	That's pretty stupid.
9617032	9618713	Only buy the real thing.
9622034	9624174	Look at the manual and look how pretty the manual is.
9624214	9626175	Try to translate the Japanese in the manual.
9626235	9626755	That would be fun.
9626975	9633377	And see, those of us who actually have a JPS2 will be enjoying their 2DX because we bought a JPS2.
9634377	9636518	Oh, we just had our typo of the night in the chat room.
9637901	9638942	Somebody was trying to say this.
9639362	9642845	Dark Knight said, Orange Lounge Radio is almost classified as a clut.
9644726	9646548	Meant to say cult, but say clut.
9649810	9651571	We just need t-shirts with typos on them.
9651611	9652232	Shut up, clut.
9660683	9666524	LemonLimeJump says, I plan on gathering up a posse to get a DDR machine put in at my college.
9667044	9668465	What's a good mix to get?
9669085	9674246	I guess everyone will have a different opinion, but what does everyone in the studio think?
9675506	9678387	My opinion is that extreme is kind of horrid.
9678407	9680728	You can go almost everywhere and find an extreme.
9681108	9684328	So really, for me, it's all about the retro at this point.
9684368	9687129	So I think a good DDR mix, it would be fun to have retro.
9687509	9693940	So either Fourth Plus, I think Fourth Plus is definitely a great one to have, Fifth Mix, or Third Korean.
9694161	9695643	Fourth Plus, Third Plus.
9697026	9699027	3rd Plus is kind of expensive, though.
9699067	9700709	3rd Koreans you can get pretty cheap, can't you?
9701389	9707093	2nd Mix was fun, because 2nd Mix had step battle in it, and nothing is as cool as step battle.
9707313	9714938	I would urge you to do just whatever's cheap and affordable for your college, which I believe 3rd Korean's the cheapest, so that or 4th Plus.
9715318	9719621	5th Mix would be a good deal, too, because there were a lot of songs in 5th Mix that didn't show up anywhere else.
9720121	9722983	So, I think Fifth Mix is definitely something good to check out.
9724044	9730108	But don't get, I mean, if you, of course you could always get an extreme, but the thing is that everybody has an extreme.
9730448	9739655	So it really depends, and I don't know what kind of area you live in, but check out DDR Freak machine locations, put in your zip code, and see what kind of machines are in your area.
9739735	9743658	And if you have three or four extreme machines within ten miles, well...
9744600	9747902	then go for something different and that'll kind of lure people to the college.
9747922	9752365	It'll lure the people to play those extreme machines to, you know, old stuff is new again.
9753666	9757408	I'm actually surprised nobody in our chat room said, F that, get in the groove!
9758389	9760550	Which really would be another option, honestly.
9761291	9763432	That might be something you might want to see if there's interest in.
9763812	9765814	I'm not going to dog on in the groove, but you know.
9767214	9769416	LemonLimeJump just wants to clarify, this is Pensacola.
9769836	9771857	Unfortunately, I don't know the Pensacola area.
9772178	9772558	What school?
9773618	9775179	I've been to Florida one time.
9775199	9775479	I don't know.
9775499	9776779	I lived an hour from Pensacola.
9776799	9777160	What school?
9778540	9778820	I don't know.
9779101	9780681	I'll wait for Lemon Lime Jump to respond.
9780701	9781622	I'll talk to Lemon Lime Jump.
9781642	9782122	Just PM me.
9782242	9783002	Okay.
9783262	9783743	But here's the thing.
9783803	9788945	I've been in Florida for a whopping one hour in my life and it was a layover when I was seven years old.
9788965	9790906	Alright, anyway.
9794293	9799157	Uh, Flaronay says, do you guys still have the Let Them Move MP3?
9799297	9801498	If so, can you play it at the end of the show, please?
9802159	9804280	Um, do you have that, Loki?
9804320	9806262	Wasn't that your thing to let them move the cow?
9806602	9807423	Doing the Let Them Move?
9807563	9808083	You remember that?
9809024	9809664	Do you have that?
9810645	9811425	Can you find it?
9811646	9813207	Can you see if you still have it so I can play it?
9813887	9814768	Okay, see if you have that.
9815668	9817009	We can fit that in for you, Flaronay.
9817430	9819291	It's pretty funny and we haven't done that joke in months.
9821713	9824834	Ranma says, seriously, are we going to see some Orange Launch Radio t-shirts?
9825595	9827456	Yes, we want to do the t-shirts.
9828976	9831177	We will have something up within the next couple weeks.
9831517	9835299	We just need a shirt designed, so we need some folks to design a shirt for us.
9835879	9836299	Hint, hint.
9836520	9836780	Hint!
9837840	9838841	Maybe we'll do a contest.
9839241	9840241	We have CDs to give away.
9840261	9841122	We could do a contest.
9842022	9844203	Don't we have anime screeners, too, that have to get given away?
9844803	9847604	We got the Appleseed prize pack still we got to give away at some point, huh?
9848905	9850526	Maybe we'll do a contest.
9850546	9851046	That might be fun.
9857767	9861290	LemonLimeJump, just wanted to clarify, it's UWF is the school she goes to.
9862451	9863332	University of West Florida.
9863692	9866054	I guess, yeah.
9866294	9870979	RPGKing7 says, question, how are you guys able to get into E3?
9872200	9872900	DDRFreak.
9873461	9877565	DDRFreak is a registered business, so DarkSakura is able to get in that way.
9877825	9879326	Loki?
9880167	9883310	I do game sales at my company.
9883976	9887042	I don't think you can get any more in the business than that.
9888604	9890905	Unfortunately, that leaves me out in the cold this year.
9891026	9900672	Last year I had some buddies at a particular gaming company that we talk an awful lot about on this station that helped me get into E3 and helped Loki get in as well.
9900752	9903473	Unfortunately, I don't have that luxury this year, so I'm kind of on my own.
9904334	9906215	So I don't know if I'm going to E3 this year.
9906375	9907456	I will find out this week.
9907696	9912439	So we'll have something on that on Sunday because I'm going to send in the paperwork this week, so we'll see what happens.
9913079	9916762	But actually, if I do get into E3, it'll be strictly because of Orange Lounge Radio.
9917402	9932306	Which is kind of cool, but we are an official business as well now too, so... Anyway, um... SSJ100Matt Which are better video game movies or comic book based movies?
9932906	9934466	By the way, you gotta play Girls Butts.
9935707	9938107	Girls Butts is so two weeks ago, we'll see.
9938707	9939908	We'll see about the Girls Butts thing.
9940908	9941028	Um...
9942449	9945311	What are better video game... Oh, which is better?
9945511	9948473	Video game based movies or comic book based movies?
9949614	9952656	On the whole, I would say comic book based movies have been better.
9953197	9954938	I would definitely second that.
9956319	9963524	That's like comparing a BB gun with a thermonuclear warhead.
9965185	9966026	There's no comparison.
9968519	9984726	I mean, when you look at, like, the old school Batman, I mean, that alone, right there, and then maybe, um, what else, Spider-Man was really good, it's comic book movies are awesome, and, unfortunately, um, you know, the, uh, um, of course, there have been bad comic book movies, Catwoman.
9987547	9996211	You know, that wasn't, that wasn't the comic book's fault, that was the director's fault, and we know who that director is, and we are trying to stop them as we speak, you know?
9997591	9999952	That wasn't you, Ebol, that directed Catwoman, was it?
10001412	10005513	I think... You sure?
10006454	10006874	Let me check.
10007034	10007494	I'm gonna check.
10008935	10011635	I'm almost positive.
10011675	10012216	You do that.
10012256	10012756	You check.
10014596	10015336	Go to the database.
10015557	10017497	But find the let them move thing first.
10018137	10018678	We need that.
10021558	10023459	I can't is not a term I understand.
10025159	10026720	All right.
10029053	10031334	Alright, we're running out of questions here.
10031354	10035095	No more questions, at least I see, for Ask Orange Lounge, unless I missed something.
10035115	10035675	I don't think so.
10036276	10038336	So we're going to go ahead and close up the old mailbag there.
10039397	10047780	And what we're going to do now is we're going to take a quick break, just a quick two-song break, and we're going to come back and a couple quick other little stories and notes, and then we're going to end tonight's show.
10047860	10055222	So we will be back after this, featuring a very, very old DDR song and a very, very new DDR song.
10056123	10057083	So we'll be back after this.
10062915	10068496	Boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob
10085805	10086925	Thank you for watching.
10086946	10088226	See you next time.
10119366	10121072	Thank you for watching!
10237416	10242001	Oh, Ash!
10242522	10245185	This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.
10248089	10250251	I don't even know if anyone gets that promo anymore.
10250631	10254674	That was when we were at the house for the show.
10255074	10255955	That was the first studio.
10256295	10260138	And they were watching Hentai on the main TV.
10260879	10265282	And I walk into the room and the first thing I see is animated ass all over the screen.
10265622	10267083	So like, oh, ass.
10268384	10269085	And then we made the promo.
10269105	10270026	And suddenly it was a promo.
10272928	10277432	All right, just so you guys know, we actually found something that we promised we would play.
10277552	10279974	So we're going to do one other song here for you guys.
10280074	10281095	So enjoy this.
10281775	10283637	You should get a kick out of this or not.
10283977	10287580	This is NMR featuring Jackazid.
10287600	10288261	Enjoy.
10305982	10319691	The money's a jaffa, so is the sideline, the mic's a deadline, but take the rewind, use them as guidelines, and it's wobble, wobble, wobble, wobble, wobble, wobble, wobble, wobble, wobble,
10353171	10355195	Sounds like a dying cow at the end.
10357198	10360123	No, Wilbert's just a spring, although that's a horse, but whatever.
10361486	10363890	That was an old fortune cookie.
10364588	10365729	Like years ago.
10365849	10367910	That was like from episode 4.
10368570	10369691	That feels weird.
10369791	10370831	I don't think it's that old.
10370971	10374093	Oh yeah, it is that old because this was when I was still not eating beef.
10375754	10379035	And we went to, we were going to Panda Express.
10380916	10382657	And I had that nasty eggplant crap.
10384078	10385879	And then we were trying to think of what we were going to do.
10385899	10387860	I was like, this eggplant makes me think of Dead Horse.
10389031	10389793	Thanks for watching!
10401997	10402818	I always love doing this.
10403038	10405259	We bring this up once every couple months or so.
10405319	10410002	And since the show's gotten some additional new listeners lately, we'll do this one more time here.
10410362	10415165	We used to do these, but they kind of took a lot of work, so we don't really do them so much anymore.
10415585	10419348	But we used to do these little flashback promos.
10419628	10420268	They're hilarious.
10420708	10421969	Listen to this.
10422309	10424891	Take a look back at episode number one.
10427569	10430231	Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.
10450188	10453730	Join us every Sunday night from 7 o'clock until 9 o'clock.
10453750	10455051	Yeah, you see how old that is?
10455091	10456812	That's when we were on this old schedule there.
10456892	10459014	So, very interesting there.
10459414	10461815	Listen to how horrible our microphones were, too.
10461835	10463336	I was using the headset.
10463396	10464897	You could hear Irene in the background.
10464917	10466498	She sounded like she was in a tin can.
10466718	10469440	You know, like, what is going on, you guys?
10470261	10472142	I'm on Orange Lounge.
10472542	10475904	I was using the headset and I ended up with like a migraine by the end of the show.
10476505	10478306	Remember I passed out in the show?
10479927	10480688	That was terrible.
10480708	10481328	We were in the front.
10481368	10482309	We were in the living room.
10484890	10486091	That was certainly fun.
10486231	10487372	And then I went to LA.
10488072	10488413	You did.
10488473	10489713	So you were gone for a couple weeks.
10490514	10491655	Let's do one more flashback.
10491855	10492455	These are kind of fun.
10492475	10493336	I like the flashbacks.
10494036	10496258	So you guys can respect the roots of Orange Lingerie.
10496278	10503062	Let's do a flashback from episode... Let's do a flashback from episode four.
10506460	10508080	on Orange Lounge Radio.
10534460	10535642	Oh, every night on the show.
10539306	10540788	As Irene makes his face.
10541268	10544212	Orange Lounge Radio makes you moist as a snake.
10544272	10547156	Join us every Sunday night from 7 p.m.
10547216	10548237	until 9 p.m.
10548257	10550980	Pacific Standard Time for the Orange Lounge.
10551801	10552963	Jamie was moist.
10555573	10556794	and I still am.
10556975	10559437	I remember she got pissed off about that one too.
10559577	10559877	I did.
10559897	10562340	She's like, don't put that in the promo.
10562380	10562800	You can't.
10562940	10564101	Why did you do that?
10564161	10565182	Rob, why?
10566604	10566844	Rob.
10566884	10568085	But now she can laugh about it.
10568165	10568405	Rob.
10568646	10569046	I said.
10569066	10569186	Rob.
10569386	10569667	What?
10569747	10570007	Rob.
10570067	10570267	What?
10570287	10570487	Rob.
10570567	10570667	Yes.
10570728	10570788	Ah.
10578979	10585374	Loki, before we finish up the show, give us some more PSP hacking news, because this is what you're all about ever since you got a PSP.
10585394	10587038	I noticed you were watching a video earlier.
10587058	10587920	Yeah, tell us about that, too.
10588493	10590514	That was the great game launcher.
10590594	10594115	You honestly have to, like, seriously twist a PSP to get it to launch a game.
10594575	10597737	And I don't know about you, but who twists a fucking, you know, console system?
10598077	10598497	Wipeout!
10599758	10602138	You don't need to twist a damn game for Wipeout!
10602619	10604159	I don't twist it when I play Wipeout.
10604459	10607120	This isn't, like, some sort of JogCon type thing.
10607601	10609561	This is, you know, a game system.
10609601	10610702	You don't try to twist it.
10610802	10611942	Of course it's gonna break.
10612683	10613623	It's not meant to twist.
10614764	10615864	God, people are retarded.
10616468	10623111	Anyways, so yeah, apparently the PSP IRC thing has been slash dotted, so that went that site.
10623692	10629054	And same with the PSP browser, that has been slash dotted as well, so that site's down.
10631476	10634577	What's this?
10634637	10636158	Haha, funny.
10639299	10644382	Oh man, honestly, who the hell does this kind of stuff is what I want to know.
10646221	10647062	Another news, though.
10648964	10650205	We'll be reporting this later.
10651986	10655149	It has been done, and the first alpha will be coming out next month.
10655429	10657451	That's right, Linux is on the DS.
10658872	10659633	Go Linux.
10660714	10663836	If it runs with electricity, there will be Linux on it.
10664737	10665778	Linux for the toaster.
10666478	10667740	I want Linux for a toaster.
10668740	10670202	And from what I read, iTunes.
10670722	10671603	iTunes for the PSP.
10674275	10681940	I will never understand what the charm is about being able to install Linux on insert system here.
10682301	10682961	I don't understand.
10683562	10688745	Is that just because people think they're going to be able to run all the Linux programs on it and everything?
10689526	10690266	I don't understand.
10690346	10693568	Why do people try to install Linux on, like, what was the one we had?
10693829	10696851	The fish on the wall had Linux installed on it?
10697291	10698132	What the hell is that?
10699056	10699796	You know what I want to do?
10700177	10702978	And I realized this the other day when I was looking at my PSP.
10702998	10704499	I'm like, what the hell is this button?
10704939	10705919	What is this thing?
10706299	10707700	What is this little thing on the top here?
10708080	10708921	It's an infrared port.
10709681	10710461	So you know what you can do?
10710642	10711662	You can use this as a remote.
10711982	10715144	I want a program on here where I can turn off TVs with the PSP.
10718605	10721487	So you can walk around Walmart just, you know, getting the electronics out.
10721547	10723568	Oh, I'm just, I'm trying out a PSP.
10724168	10725849	Click, click, click, click, all the TVs are going off.
10726573	10727314	Actually, I want to get one.
10727334	10728354	Didn't you order one of those keychains?
10728374	10730236	I thought you were going to order the keychain that shuts them all off.
10731277	10732257	No, I never got around to that.
10732698	10733038	Damn.
10733218	10735540	We need to get one and we need to figure out how to increase the strength of this.
10735980	10736861	And go in the Best Buy.
10738202	10739363	Watch the magic.
10741924	10742745	Like an EMP?
10742765	10744727	I don't remember.
10744747	10749250	I don't remember what it does, but it's like a little thing that you put on your keychain.
10749270	10755795	And what it does is it basically cycles through like a hundred different popular televisions and their power off signal.
10756280	10757721	That's awesome, I want one.
10758162	10765868	So you can like go in, if the TV's too loud at a restaurant or whatever, you just get out your little keychain, boop, and if you hold it for 15 seconds, eventually the TV will turn off.
10766488	10772093	I still want the portable EMP, so I can aim it at people's cell phones while they're driving.
10772854	10775496	I was thinking, I need to find the...
10776823	10778004	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10802407	10803728	I found three different networks.
10803989	10804949	One with the password on it.
10805090	10806371	Well, actually, two with passwords.
10806451	10807031	One that's not.
10808533	10817320	So, you know, it's sort of like, you know, a dumb person's version of, you know, I forget, War Driving.
10818802	10822285	You should walk around the complex and you just look like you're playing your PSP.
10822505	10824567	But can you download files from the networks?
10824687	10825728	No, not on the PSP yet.
10826562	10829684	Not yet, but I was reading some other things today on the site.
10830104	10835026	There's a cord out there for the Mini-B, which is this little mini-USB port.
10835186	10839189	This is a proprietary thing, of course, to Sony, their Mini-B.
10840549	10848173	It's USB-A, which is your standard USB, the female part, so you can actually plug in USB devices to the Mini-B port.
10848693	10855157	So, in theory, you could put flash drives or whatever, USB flash drives, hook it up to the PSP via this...
10855957	10858678	or, like I was thinking, a portable hard drive.
10859978	10862379	Imagine, 160 gigs on my PSP.
10865240	10870482	Anyway, more PSP pirating and hacking news to come later on Orange Lounge Radio.
10870522	10871942	But for now, that's it.
10872002	10872662	Three hours are up.
10873903	10877224	Tune into the podcast if you want to know more.
10878244	10880085	Time to go around and get everybody's final thought.
10880245	10881105	Angel, your final thought.
10883260	10886503	I need to recharge my PSP, er, not PSP, DS.
10886983	10888084	Yeah, my brain's not working.
10888144	10888424	Bye.
10891146	10891447	Julie.
10891767	10892988	I want to kill some Sims.
10893748	10894289	It's fun.
10895490	10896330	Killing Sims is fun.
10896791	10897291	Uh, Loki!
10898832	10905498	Now, do you have the, um, the, uh, what was it, the college update for, um, Sims 2?
10907099	10908440	Not yet, but I want to get that.
10908500	10909681	Then I can kill more of them.
10910362	10910602	Okay.
10912362	10916323	and my final thought is I like money.
10918044	10919124	DarkSakura, your final thought.
10919524	10920565	Reject false icons.
10922445	10923626	Last word of the show.
10923786	10925026	One word to sum it all up.
10925486	10926727	I'm going to give it to Julie tonight.
10926987	10929228	One word to sum everything up and it's the final word of the show.
10929268	10929828	Good night, everybody.
10929848	10930428	See you next week.
10930468	10931088	Thanks for listening.
10931928	10933469	And the word of the day is cat.
10934685	10935366	Mashed Potatoes!
10962833	10984650	Hey, Sweet Potatoes, Baked Potatoes, Potato Chips, Whoa, Smoked Sausage, Fried Chicken, Pepperoni Pizza, and Deluxe Dips.
10986052	10991056	Nobody can make a donut, do the things you do.
10992333	11019849	Believe me baby, believe me baby, I've tried what I feel, I've eaten meatballs in Sweden, and pork chops in Peru, but all I did, all I did, all I did, all I did, all I did was remind me of you baby, and your mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, oh baby, mashed butter.
11022586	11026097	Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
11061443	11063404	All right, that's going to do it for tonight's show, everybody.
11063544	11065905	Thanks a lot for listening and supporting us, as always.
11065925	11066845	We appreciate your support.
11067205	11072847	We are going to go from our live broadcast mode to our basic broadcast, so you're going to get disconnected.
11073147	11078989	We'll just reconnect to the stream in about 15 seconds to resume listening to all your favorite EDR, 2DX, and Dance Mania favorites.
11079029	11080350	But first, a thought for you guys.
11081710	11083831	In the studio, we have actually a clock.
11084278	11085059	Laziness prevails again.
11111567	11113571	And on that thought, have a great night everybody.
11113591	11114513	We'll see you next week.
11115114	11116236	Reconnect in 15 seconds.
