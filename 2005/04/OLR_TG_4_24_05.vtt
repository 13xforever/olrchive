Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition week of April 25th, 2005.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition,

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Skye and Logan.

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
Hello, good morning, afternoon or evening to you, whatever the case may be.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
That's kind of the neat thing about podcasts is that you can listen to them whenever you feel like it.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Well, you are listening to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition,

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
your home for gamer chat and what gamers really want to know when you talk about games that don't suck.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
A couple that do sometimes.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Skye.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Joining me as always, my awesome co-hosts.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Say hello to Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Woo!

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Woo!

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Exciting. Exciting day, isn't it?

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Old.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Also with us, say hello to Loki.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Hello.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Hi, how you doing?

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
I'm good.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Alright.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
This is an interesting show because we're actually taping earlier in the week than we usually do.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
We usually tape these podcasts on Sunday nights, but actually we're on Friday night right now.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
This is the very last thing that we're recording in the old studio, so it should be very interesting.

01:15.000 --> 01:23.000
It's kind of freaky right now because the walls are bare and pretty much all that's left is DarkSakura's chair and all the microphones.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
I'm actually packing during the show.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
It's amazing.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Yes, we're being evicted as we speak. No.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I'm maintaining my current position.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
The same position I always keep during the show, which is in this big comfy green thing.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
In your big comfy green chair.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Yeah.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
Alright. Anyway, let's start off talking about our own gaming week and then we'll get into some gaming news.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
We've got a lot of interesting news tonight.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Starting off though, how was your gaming week?

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
What kind of games have you been playing this week, DarkSakura?

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
I finally played Luminous.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Ooh, what'd you think?

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
It was pretty fun. I like the music.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
I did the single player mode, which I got to level 13 on.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
Because you start off picking your skin, so that's all I did.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
So you didn't play the mode where you progressed through the different skins, you just stuck with one.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
Yeah, I picked one skin and got to level 13.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
That's cool.

02:08.000 --> 02:15.000
Now, I'll tell you, the weird thing about Luminous when you're playing that skin mode the first time where you're going through the different skins is you kind of don't expect it.

02:15.000 --> 02:22.000
So you're playing and then suddenly all the colors change and you're like, what the hell did I do? What did I do? Why is everything changing color?

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
It's kind of freaky.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
It does sound pretty freaky.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Yeah.

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
Apart from that, it was more widescreen pong and not a lot much else.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
The usual webby games.

02:31.000 --> 02:37.000
Yeah, I avoided the jeep simulator again because it really made me motion sick.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
Is it just me or are we kind of a little bit of a dry spell right now?

02:41.000 --> 02:47.000
I mean, sure, there's some games, but we're kind of in a dry spell right now until E3. That's going to be like the big boom.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
I'm pissed off because Dan traded my copy of Dark Stalkers for stupid Midnight Club.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
What's Midnight Club? I don't even know.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Racing.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
Dub edition. I think that's one of those games we don't talk about on the show usually.

02:57.000 --> 03:12.000
The last Midnight Club that I played, I cheated the hell out of it and we basically got this jet car type thing where we're just driving super fast around for no reason.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
Well, how was your gaming week since we're on you anyway?

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
Ridge Racer. PSP. That is it.

03:19.000 --> 03:26.000
Yeah, because you're in the middle of moving right now, so you're probably like me because when you hear about how my gaming week was, it's very similar.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
No consoles this week really.

03:28.000 --> 03:37.000
I played Final Fantasy for all of one minute to log in to get the update and then, well obviously I didn't take a minute, but you know, logged in, said hi, and then logged out and that was it.

03:37.000 --> 03:44.000
And just now that Comcast is down, I can't play my online game.

03:44.000 --> 03:54.000
No, so I've been playing a lot of PSP because I bring my PSP to work in my Tashi case, so it looks like I have a briefcase walking in, but it's actually my PSP.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
And then I play that during breaks and during lunch and whatnot.

03:58.000 --> 04:05.000
And so I've been playing a race here, race there, unlocking cars as I go along, and I'm actually pretty good at the game.

04:05.000 --> 04:11.000
I kind of have fishtail every now and then, but I'm getting the drifting down pretty good.

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
Apparently I drift a lot because that's how you get the nitros in the game, so I get a lot of nitros.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
It's pretty cool and I like how they have all the old tracks in it.

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
Very cool. Have you heard about any new hacks on the PSP lately?

04:25.000 --> 04:33.000
What isn't there? Let's see, there's the hack where you can control your iTunes with your PSP.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Oh, I read about that one too, I read about that.

04:35.000 --> 04:43.000
There's the hack where you can control your house with the PSP, assuming you have a wired house, which all of five people have.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
How many people our age have wired houses like that?

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
I want one.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
Anyways, want and have are different things though.

04:50.000 --> 04:58.000
PSP Tetris, but it's just online Tetris. All of them revolve around the browser hack and it's just all web applets, so it's really stupid.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
Suddenly, sales of Wipeout are incredibly popular.

05:01.000 --> 05:11.000
MSN, or was it, yeah, Microsoft, their messenger is on PSP now, you can do that.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Isn't that ironic?

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
However, I did see some pretty cool DS hacks that were kind of funny.

05:17.000 --> 05:25.000
There's one where they ported, it's an actual emulator for your DS that emulates the TI-85.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Like the graphing calculator?

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
Uh-huh, the graphing calculator, and you use the touch screen to push the buttons and everything and it graphs and it's a calculator.

05:33.000 --> 05:43.000
But what I think would be fun is to put the assembly programs for the graphing calculator onto the DS emulator and that's just way too complicated.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
You're talking about emulating an emulator, basically.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Uh-huh.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
You're crazy.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
That would be fun.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
But no, those are still coming out right now.

05:53.000 --> 06:01.000
They're supposedly doing this thing on Engadget where they're supposed to be the best DS hack versus the best PSP hack.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
The PSP hacks so far have been pretty stupid, to be honest.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
I mean, there hasn't been really anything cool.

06:07.000 --> 06:23.000
There's been one that I saw that was kind of neat where you can put an external antenna on your Wi-Fi because I guess there's a little cord inside there that's actually just a Wi-Fi antenna and you can just hook up a new antenna to the outside and extend your range for the Wi-Fi.

06:23.000 --> 06:34.000
But if you want to go crazy, you can do all the word driving stuff where you put a satellite dish attached to it and you can communicate with things thousands of feet away.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
Okay, that's a little much. I think you're going a little crazy there, people.

06:38.000 --> 06:51.000
See, today I was locked out of my house for a little bit and I actually almost jumped on my neighbor's network to post online that I was locked out of my house on a live journal or something.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
But then my fiancÃ© got there at the key, so I didn't get to.

06:55.000 --> 07:03.000
Alright. My gaming week was kind of very similar to yours because I'm also in the process of moving right now, obviously.

07:03.000 --> 07:13.000
So I don't really have any consoles hooked up right now, which is too bad because I wanted to check out how Halo 2 was going to be after the patches and I wanted to check out the brand new song pack that just came out for DDR UltraMix 2.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
What new song pack?

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
Yeah, there was a new song pack that came out out of nowhere on UltraMix 2.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
What songs do they have in that?

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
Waver-er and Love This Feelin' and I don't know.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Waver-er?

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
It's like an old school song.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Waver-er's from Silent Hill.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Yeah.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Huh?

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Silent Hill 3.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Yeah.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Why don't we talk about this on the normal show?

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
I totally forgot.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Oh.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
I didn't even know what songs that came out. I haven't really been surprised.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Exclusive podcast material.

07:40.000 --> 07:50.000
Exclusive, yeah. You know, it's funny, ever since we made that change to saying we're not going to talk about rhythm and games, rhythm and music games so much on the podcast, it seems to be we get a story every week now.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Oh well.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
Yeah, song pack 10's out. Go check it out. A few UltraMix 2 bands.

07:54.000 --> 08:00.000
But okay, so I've been wanting to play consoles, but I really just, you know, everything's in a box. I don't want to, you know, hook it up and play.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
So I've been playing DS. Instead of PSP, I've been playing DS.

08:03.000 --> 08:11.000
Mr. Driller. I strangely, for some reason when I first got my DS, I kind of plugged in the Metroid demo and then I went eh and put it away.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
I lost my demo.

08:12.000 --> 08:18.000
I put it back in and I'm playing the Metroid demo again. It's pretty cool. I'm looking forward to the full game.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
I've lost my demo.

08:19.000 --> 08:27.000
Which is weird. It's weird because I wasn't into Metroid first person on the GameCube, but for some reason on the DS, it doesn't bug me at all.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
I don't know if it's just because the controls are different.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
It hurts the hell out of my hand.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Weird. I don't know.

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
My hand cramps up from playing that game. It's just because you have to hold it all weird and stuff.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Yeah.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
I just don't like it.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
Alright, let's get into some gaming news, shall we?

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
Actually, I think what we'll do is start off with a Nintendo story.

08:45.000 --> 08:50.000
It's actually a follow up to something we were talking about a few weeks ago on a previous podcast.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
Do you remember how I mentioned that an official Nintendo store is going to be opening up in New York City?

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Yeah.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
Alright, well they set a date for that. It's going to be opening on May 14th.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
And as a reminder, that's going to be at Rockefeller Plaza in Midtown Manhattan.

09:03.000 --> 09:09.000
And basically what they're going to be doing, they're going to be having a huge party the opening day and giving away prizes.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
So if you're in the New York area, you might want to go check that out.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
That's Saturday, May 14th.

09:12.000 --> 09:18.000
And of course, the facility will also be the home of the Pokemon Trading Card Game League.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Okay, that'll keep me away from that.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
That and the fact that it's on the other side.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
Well, there'll be plenty more to do than just Pokemon. That's just one aspect of it.

09:26.000 --> 09:32.000
You'll walk in, you'll walk into the store, doo doo doo doo, seizure fever! Woo!

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
Porygon!

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
Moving on to news, something going on with the PSP.

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
You know how we've been getting a lot of UMD movies here. It's starting to kind of pick up the format a little bit.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
Now, Bokeh, you're somebody who actually works in the distribution industry.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Yeah.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Do you think UMDs are going to catch on?

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
They say they are.

09:51.000 --> 09:58.000
I think it's stupid, to be honest. I mean, I don't spend my money on fucking buying a portable system to bring games.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
Or, you know, if you're buying the games, why do you need the UMDs?

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
I mean, you're never sitting down long enough to watch a whole freaking movie.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
And by the time you do, your battery's spent.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
Give me an idea of some new UMDs that are coming out pretty soon.

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
Like, they have the House of Flying Daggers. They've got Triple X just came out.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
There was Kill Bill Volume 1.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
That's cool.

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
Now, that was an exclusive, though. They oversold on that, actually, so we couldn't buy any.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
But Kill Bill Volume 1 is out there. Hellboy's coming out, I think.

10:28.000 --> 10:35.000
See, now, what all these movies have in common is they're kind of like action and, you know, very action-oriented and blow-em-up kind of big films, right?

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Sort of.

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
Well, the story I wanted to read for you guys is that actually in Japan, they're going to be getting some new UMD movies.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
What kind of American movies do you think are coming out in Japan?

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Kill Bill?

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Hitch.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
Alright, here they are. Here's the movies that are coming out in Japan.

10:49.000 --> 10:54.000
On June 22, Sony Pictures Entertainment is going to be releasing 13 Ghosts.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
You remember that movie? Had the chick from American Pie in it? Yeah, exactly.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
13 Ghosts, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
That's a good movie.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
And Charlie's Angels.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
I'm sorry.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
I can see where that would fly.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Now, not the sequel, but the first one. Charlie's Angels, the first one.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
The sequel sucked.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
Hey, get this. Get this.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
You got served.

11:14.000 --> 11:21.000
And that's exactly what I'm saying to the Japanese PSP audience right now with that release.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
They're importing American games.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Yeah, isn't that weird?

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
Because there's games here that aren't out there.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
Of course, they have packed picks already on DS.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Yeah, differences.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Eh, eh.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Alright, I just thought I'd share that.

11:36.000 --> 11:41.000
So, if you think the movies we're getting here are a little weird, just remember in Japan, they're getting You Got Served.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
I'm still waiting for Smart Bomb to come out.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
What's that?

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
It's a puzzle game for the PSP.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
There's a lot of puzzle games coming out.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
You got pushed back, though.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
It's pretty cool. It's sort of like, uh, I don't really know how to describe it.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
It's just a bunch of different puzzles.

11:54.000 --> 12:01.000
Maybe, like, if you slowed down WarioWare and had each puzzle last, like, a little longer.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
It's like that.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
We are getting so many puzzle games in the different handhelds.

12:05.000 --> 12:14.000
On the PSP, Mercury just came out recently, Luminous, Colon, I might be mispronouncing that, but there's a new game coming out.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
That's a puzzle game.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
Sticky Balls is another game that's coming out on PSP.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Puzzle game.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Smart Bomb.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
And that's the one you just mentioned.

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
And then on the DS, we're getting Electroplankton, Meteos.

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
Now, Electroplankton is not really a game.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
It's just like, stuff happens.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
I'm going to have Electroplankton.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
I'm sorry.

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
I actually, the early reviews I'm reading on it say that it might be a little bit overrated.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
It's kind of interesting.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
We don't know yet.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
I want to, I still want to see it myself.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
I played Seaman, okay?

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
She played Seaman.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
I used the American name, thank you.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
Moving on.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
This was a really big story earlier this week.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
This just happened the same day that our podcast went on the net.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
I'm kind of sad we didn't hit on it last week, but it's definitely worth mentioning.

13:03.000 --> 13:09.000
If you haven't heard yet, GameStop just bought EB Games early this week.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
It was a big announcement that they made to the investors on Monday.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
Very interesting.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
What do you think this is going to mean for the future?

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Basically the reason why they're doing this.

13:20.000 --> 13:25.000
A lot of people see it as GameStop is buying their biggest competitor, but you have to think of it this way.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
The biggest competitor, really, is Walmart.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
That's their biggest competitor.

13:30.000 --> 13:36.000
So what's happening is that GameStop and EB are kind of teaming up to take on Walmart, which I think is very interesting.

13:36.000 --> 13:41.000
And those very big super vendors, Best Buys and Targets, things like that as well.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
What do you think of this?

13:42.000 --> 13:47.000
When evil has purchased the greater evil.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
And in other news, service still sucks.

13:51.000 --> 13:59.000
What's interesting, if you take polls, if you go to different internet forums, because every gaming forum is lit up on this topic.

13:59.000 --> 14:06.000
It's like, it depends on the area you live, whether the EB store is better or the GameStop store is better.

14:06.000 --> 14:11.000
And I think somebody was joking on the three hour show this week that it's like the red states and the blue states.

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
It just depends on your neck of the woods, which store is better.

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
So people are very, you know, it's almost like half and half.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Yeah.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
They both suck.

14:26.000 --> 14:34.000
They really, they both do. I mean, I went to the mall, Arden mall, and they had like, you know, you know, I asked, do you have any PSPs?

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
No, you're never going to find one.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Yeah.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
And went to GameStop, you know, they gave me the same spiel with the Best Buy.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Oh, look, there's a pile of them.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Yeah, they've got them at Dan's store.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
There you go.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
So I said, fuck you people, you suck.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
It's because you went to the mall.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
I know, I was over there.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
All right. The Nintendo DS.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
This is no surprise. What new story?

15:00.000 --> 15:06.000
If I said Nintendo was launching a brand new peripheral, what do you think it is?

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Here in the US, finally.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
They already had it in Japan.

15:10.000 --> 15:15.000
Is it something that you can buy over and over and over again and still be suckered into buying another?

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Yes, yes.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
Would it be a new color?

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
Yes, a new color to the Nintendo DS.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
Dude, I want that graphite colored one. That one's cool.

15:26.000 --> 15:32.000
Well, this is the interesting thing. Here in the US, we're only getting the blue one right now.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
Yeah.

15:33.000 --> 15:39.000
So, we do have the titanium one as well, but there's going to be the blue one coming out.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
People, I just want you to know something.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
There's actually a website out there. Now, I don't remember the exact website URL.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Well, what a useful tip this is.

15:48.000 --> 15:55.000
Oh, shut up. Anyways, you know, it's basically you can get your Xbox, your PlayStation 2,

15:55.000 --> 16:03.000
your, you know, DS or your, you know, Game Boy SP or whatever in any color you want.

16:03.000 --> 16:09.000
You don't have to buy from Nintendo. You don't have to wait for them to come out with another color.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Those crappy stickers that you put on?

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
No. Custom paint jobs.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
Oh, gosh. Pimp my DS. Is that what this is?

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Dude, maybe I can have camo.

16:18.000 --> 16:26.000
But you can design, you can select which color. Like, for the Xbox and PS2 systems, they come with controllers that match.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
But, it's like, seriously, people, you don't have to...

16:28.000 --> 16:33.000
This is something I would be expecting, like, you know, Paris Hilton to buy a system to match her purse or something.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
She did buy a PSP.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Oh, shut up.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
She probably went and had that gem-crusting done to it, too.

16:40.000 --> 16:47.000
Um, also in June, when the blue DS comes out, Nintendo's gonna be putting out some DS games! Yay!

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Some pretty neat ones at that.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
Meteos. Meteos is one of them coming out in June.

16:51.000 --> 16:58.000
And Kirby Canvas Curse, which, you know, implies it's gonna be a Kirby game that uses a stylus.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Big surprise, huh?

17:00.000 --> 17:05.000
When are we getting Mario Paint DS?

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
I don't know. I don't know.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
That's what I want.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
That would make sense.

17:09.000 --> 17:15.000
Alright, well, there's the game in WarioWare, the mini-game.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Yeah, I know it's not the same.

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
Yeah, but nothing beats a gelatin game.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
The gelatin game is the best.

17:23.000 --> 17:30.000
Alright, Orange Lounge Radio, we're not just here to talk about games, because if we talked about games all day long,

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
we'd have no time to go terrorize children at the local arcade.

17:33.000 --> 17:43.000
So, we're here to better your life, and what way to better your life than to allow our very own Dark Sakura to give you her advice column?

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Oh, joy.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
She's enthused about her own column.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
What advice do you have for us tonight, Dark Sakura?

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
I don't think enthused is a word.

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
Whatever. Way to go, Grammar.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
Alright, thank you for that advice column!

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
We'll just end that segment.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
You know what? I have a ferret.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Alright, what's the advice column about tonight?

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
How to foil a UFO abduction.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
Number one, do not panic.

18:12.000 --> 18:20.000
The extraterrestrial biological entity, or EBE, may sense your fear and act rashly.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Two, control your thoughts.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Do not think of anything violent or upsetting.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
The EBE may have the ability to read your mind.

18:27.000 --> 18:32.000
Try to avoid mental images of abduction, boarding the saucer, or anal probes.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Such images may encourage you to...

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
I knew anal probe would come up somewhere in this.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Three, resist verbally.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
Firmly tell the EBE to leave you alone.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Four, resist...

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
No means no!

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Resist mentally.

18:47.000 --> 18:52.000
Picture yourself enveloped in a protective shield of white light, or in a safe place.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
Telepathic EBEs may get the message.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Five, resist physically.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
Physical resistance should only be used as a last resort.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
Go for the EBE's eyes if it has any.

19:03.000 --> 19:08.000
You will not know what its other, more sensitive areas are.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
But my final advice?

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Yes.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Don't live in the Midwest.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
Alright, my final advice is, holy shit, if there's a fucking alien coming after you,

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
honestly, poking in the eye is gonna piss the fucker off.

19:20.000 --> 19:25.000
And if I were the alien, and because basically the aliens would look at us like bugs,

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
I would throw you across the fucking room, smash you into a wall or something.

19:29.000 --> 19:34.000
I mean, seriously, they could probably just crack you in half, I mean...

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
Besides, we know that there's no such thing as aliens.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Those are just weather balloons in tinfoil.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Swamp gas.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
You got a real potty mouth tonight, you know that?

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
What's your point?

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Moving on.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
In fact, I feel like I need to cleanse this with something pure.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
So we're gonna talk about a pure story for a minute.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
Honestly, if they wanna abduct someone, we have plenty of people in Hollywood that are

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
completely useless.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Just take them.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
We have plenty of people in Washington, D.C. that are completely useless.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Oh!

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
There you go!

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
It's one on each coast.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Alright, anyway.

20:02.000 --> 20:08.000
I feel like we need to cleanse Loki's potty mouth with a nice, pure, family-friendly story.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
So...

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Grand Theft Auto?

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
No.

20:11.000 --> 20:17.000
Namco, home tech, bought the rights to a very famous comic strip this week.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Any thoughts?

20:18.000 --> 20:23.000
When I say wholesome and pure comic strip, what do you think?

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Blondie?

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
No.

20:25.000 --> 20:30.000
No, they've bought the rights to the Peanuts.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Oh, that's right.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
The Charlie Brown gang.

20:32.000 --> 20:37.000
Well, Snoopy's really big and Sanrio has a license for them, you know.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Yeah, well.

20:38.000 --> 20:43.000
Namco home tech announced that they are in agreement with United Media to create and

20:43.000 --> 20:49.000
publish games featuring characters from the Peanuts comic strip and all the other properties

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
that go with that.

20:50.000 --> 20:55.000
The deal will be good through 2009.

20:55.000 --> 21:00.000
No details revealed yet about any possible games that are coming out, but can you imagine

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
some of the games that could come out for this?

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
The Great Pumpkin.

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
This year, The Great Pumpkin's gonna visit me!

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
I'm gonna wait here.

21:11.000 --> 21:17.000
What kind of Charlie Brown games would you like to see on a console?

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
It's your video game, Charlie Brown!

21:20.000 --> 21:25.000
I want to see a football game where Charlie Brown finally gets to stick it to Lucy and

21:25.000 --> 21:30.000
just beat her ass, because you know how she would never let him kick the damn football?

21:30.000 --> 21:35.000
Stick it to Lucy and beat her ass.

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
That sounds like a whole different game to me.

21:39.000 --> 21:45.000
In fact, that might tie into our next story.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
Dark Sakura knows what's coming up.

21:48.000 --> 21:55.000
A very famous website is creating content specifically for viewing on your PSP.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
The website?

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Playboy.com.

21:59.000 --> 22:07.000
We'll be offering a science fiction themed pictorial of Amy Sue Cooper, who is the Playboy

22:07.000 --> 22:11.000
Cyber Girl of the Year 2005.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
Cyber Girl of the Year.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
This is content specifically for your PSP.

22:17.000 --> 22:25.000
Two non-nude galleries and a video are gonna be available on Playboy.com.

22:25.000 --> 22:33.000
However, the nude content will only be available exclusively through the Cyber Club program.

22:33.000 --> 22:37.000
Is any nerd out there gonna actually pay for porn?

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
Come on, there's so much free porn out there that you can simply down-

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
People had free porn on their PSP the first day.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Exactly, they all need Playboy.

22:46.000 --> 22:53.000
See, this is just like that stupid iPod crap with the iPod picture or whatever the hell it's called.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
iPod photo or whatever.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
Really, people?

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
It's just so pointless.

22:59.000 --> 23:04.000
Why do you need to download something you can see on your computer to your PSP?

23:04.000 --> 23:09.000
I mean, they're like, well, we're releasing PSP formatted video.

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
Yeah, you have to download the video from your computer to your PSP to watch it.

23:13.000 --> 23:20.000
Because sometimes masturbation is not always something you do at the computer.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
Don't you want those pictures to go?

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
No.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
I don't know.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
If you're into that.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
There's better things to download.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
Assuming you're into that.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
Not that we endorse that.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
There's better things to download than your PSP.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Oh, man.

23:33.000 --> 23:43.000
I'm sorry, but first off, folks, I mean, you're gonna have to buy a larger memory card if you're gonna want to do any of this crap to your PSP.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
Really, why waste the time?

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
I mean, honestly, there's free porn out there.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
It's all over the damn place.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
I mean, you really don't need to look far.

23:55.000 --> 24:01.000
Alright, DarkSakura says our PSP space is better spent on other downloads from the internet. Like what?

24:01.000 --> 24:10.000
Like if you go to fans.gorillas.com on the news link, there is a little phrase there for the most recent update.

24:10.000 --> 24:16.000
It says, for those of you with Sony PSPs, look for a very exclusive Gorillas download in the next 24 hours on this site.

24:16.000 --> 24:24.000
So that means by Saturday, which I don't know when people are gonna listen to this, but Saturday there's going to be...

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
Maybe a couple days early, so Saturday will have already passed by the time people hear this.

24:28.000 --> 24:33.000
There's downloadable content. I would think that it would be either linked from the news site or from the multimedia link.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
So if you're a fan of that music group, the Gorillas, who have a new album coming out soon, yes?

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Next month.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
Alright, very cool.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Demon Days.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
Fangirl. Fangirl.

24:40.000 --> 24:46.000
Hopefully it will not suck like the Def Punk album did or the Prodigy album.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
Ah, the tracks I've heard so far are pretty good.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Or the Crystal Method album.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
I've heard the entire thing and it's brilliant.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
Or the Michael Jackson album.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
Hey, it has Dennis Hopper speaking on it. How cool is that?

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
And that song is freaking awesome.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Dennis Hopper? Dude, that guy's awesome.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
See?

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
He was in a movie called... wait, Dennis Hopper. Yeah, that's the same Dennis Hopper.

25:05.000 --> 25:10.000
He was in a movie called Space Truckers. I actually watched that movie. It was boring.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Hello, gamer chat. Hello.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Dennis Hopper's awesome.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
Alright.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
Space Truckers.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Moving on, moving back.

25:17.000 --> 25:22.000
Halo 2. A story you guys always love to talk about, so I'll make this quick.

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
Halo 2 is going to have their brand new maps up on April 25th.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
So by the time most of you guys hear this, you'll be able to get this.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
Two free maps are going to be available for download.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Containment and Warlock.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Containment is a snow-based level.

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
Warlock is influenced by the original Halo map, Wizard.

25:40.000 --> 25:45.000
And then you can download two more maps called Turf and Sanctuary.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
It's going to be six bucks.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
Other maps are going to come on June 28th.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
So for those of you guys playing Halo online, this is kind of cool.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
This is something, you know, kind of mixed up a little bit.

25:54.000 --> 25:58.000
So between the patch they just rolled out and this, you know, keeps Halo 2 fresh.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
So good for them.

25:59.000 --> 26:08.000
Hopefully none of those maps will suck as bad as the Battle Mode maps in the latest Mario Kart game.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
Including the wonderful map that was a square.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
Another map that was, like, almost a square. Mario shaped square.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
And some other crappy ones.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Sorry.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
That's alright.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
And I hope when their game patches, it patches better than Final Fantasy XI did this week.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Because, oh my gosh.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
Crap.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
I got so frustrated.

26:26.000 --> 26:30.000
I don't know if it has to do with those Denial of Service attacks that have been going on.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
But it took me two days to patch.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
It was horrible.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
I connected, I started in the morning.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
It didn't work.

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
I logged on later on at, like, 10 p.m.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
And it was still backed up there.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
I was like, what the hell?

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
This is retarded.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
Finally downloaded, and guess what?

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
It's more crap that I can't use yet.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
Here's something else that's kind of interesting.

26:54.000 --> 26:59.000
Sony Online Entertainment is going to be doing a new service called the Station Exchange.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
And this is only rolling out for EverQuest 2.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
But what it is, this is very, very controversial.

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
Because the Station Exchange, this is something officially sanctioned by Sony.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
And guess what you do?

27:09.000 --> 27:13.000
You can trade your items for real live money.

27:13.000 --> 27:18.000
So it's basically endorsing trading items for money in-game.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
But they want to control it.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
Exactly.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
They want to control it.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
They probably have a way to make a profit on it.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
Oh, exactly.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
I'm sure there's got to be.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
So it's interesting, though.

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
This is the very first time something like this has happened.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
What do you guys think?

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
Is this, should the company be endorsing this kind of behavior?

27:35.000 --> 27:40.000
They're doing it to combat it, the eBay-type sales.

27:40.000 --> 27:45.000
It's probably not going to do much good, but we'll see.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
It'll never work.

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
Well, the interesting thing is that they want to,

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
and I think this is kind of clever,

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
is that they're going to put the people who want to participate in this

27:54.000 --> 27:58.000
on separate servers than the people who don't want to participate in this.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
So I think that's kind of interesting.

28:00.000 --> 28:06.000
I don't know if that's going to work, but it's interesting nonetheless.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Interesting is a good word for it, yeah.

28:08.000 --> 28:12.000
I have my issues with games like EverQuest 2 and World of Warcraft

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
where you have like 90 billion servers out there.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Some of these servers have player kills.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Some of these servers are all-out war.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
Some of these servers are fun.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
Some of these servers have auction, blah, blah, blah.

28:24.000 --> 28:28.000
It's like really, I mean, stop trying to appease everyone

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
because there's people going to be pissed off no matter what.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
Just make a game that works.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
That's one thing I do kind of.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Some of these people are so lazy they need a type of command

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
to order online pizza.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
That's kind of why I kind of like Final Fantasy XI

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
because it's like who cares if you and the Japanese guy

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
speak different languages.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
You play together and you play nice.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Seriously, it needs to be like that.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
Well, back in the days of Ragnarok Online

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
when I was playing on the Korean servers

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
and I couldn't talk to anybody because,

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
oh, I'm sorry, my laptop doesn't handle Korean.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Well, not my laptop, but my keyboard.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
I was like, please speak English, please.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
And then now you type in emotes and everything.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
And then when I was playing on the American server,

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
well, the international server for a while though,

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
they have like the every other country server now

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
and you had to be a bit tolerant

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
because you'd be dealing with people from all over the world.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
Exactly.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
And they had really weird food items in that game

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
being at a Korean game.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
Moving on.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
Back in the Rock was cool.

29:31.000 --> 29:36.000
Except for all the hell please spelled H-L-P-L-S.

29:36.000 --> 29:40.000
Hell please, port please, P-L-Z.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
I hung out with this one priest

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
who was really kind of pissy about the whole thing.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
God, you make it sound like real life.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
Okay, who was talking about it?

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
Yeah, I was hanging out with this priest.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
We were questing together.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
We were like going out.

29:54.000 --> 29:58.000
We were clubbing and then we walked into a bar.

29:58.000 --> 30:02.000
There was this one person who was following us around the whole time

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
warped to Alberta or something.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Like Canada?

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Yeah, like Canada.

30:09.000 --> 30:13.000
So finally, fine, here, opened a warp

30:13.000 --> 30:19.000
and the person walked in, warped into the haunted place.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
Gas time.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Not the haunted place.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
Yeah.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
Mexico?

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
Anyway.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
No.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Moving on.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
If you guys ever have a comment on our show,

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
we'd love to hear from you guys.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Also, if you have any questions you want to ask us on the podcast,

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
hey, why not?

30:34.000 --> 30:39.000
Our email address, togo, T-O-G-O at orangeloungeradio.com.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
All one word there.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
This is our website where you're at at orangeloungeradio.com.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
Exactly.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
We never get that much mail

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
and I try to piss them off every week

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
and no one says they hate mail.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
I know.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
No one loves us.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
I'm really starting to wonder.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
And I know people are listening to this show

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
because I've looked at the stats.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
More people listen to this than listen to our live station.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
So, we know you're out there.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
That's scary.

30:58.000 --> 31:02.000
This is going to be used against me if I run for president.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Oh, that's funny.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
People with iPods.

31:05.000 --> 31:09.000
I'm saving one of our best stories here for the end.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
New Zelda details.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
The new Zelda game that's coming out on the Nintendo GameCube,

31:14.000 --> 31:18.000
which makes all the fanboys squee with glee about this one.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
And girls.

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
Spanish games publication, Jabi Consolas,

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
has leaked some information about the new Zelda,

31:27.000 --> 31:31.000
or at least, you know, is putting information in their magazine.

31:31.000 --> 31:36.000
They're basically saying that it's going to be a 70-hour game.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
That's a long time.

31:38.000 --> 31:42.000
It's supposed to be a world that's even bigger than Ocarina of Time.

31:42.000 --> 31:47.000
Supposedly, it's supposed to be about two or three times larger, in fact.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
Very interesting.

31:48.000 --> 31:53.000
And some of the new outfits include Link being, like, a peasant style.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
And then they even have some screenshots,

31:55.000 --> 32:02.000
one showing, like, a Triforce that's kind of tattooed or emblazed on his hand.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
So, very interesting.

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
Well, that's because the Triforce was tattooed on his hand.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
But just that amount of detail is very, you know, very cool.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
And he also becomes a ninja.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Curse you, Trogdor.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
I mean, Ganon.

32:17.000 --> 32:21.000
There's some villages that are, like, several zones big as well.

32:21.000 --> 32:26.000
There was another demo where Link battles a horde of monsters

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
while riding the horse.

32:28.000 --> 32:32.000
You can choose between Link's sword or Link's bow to take down the riders.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
So, it's kind of neat.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
And the bow no longer has an infinite range.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
It only has a limited range on it.

32:38.000 --> 32:42.000
So, interesting.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
The Z-targeting is back for the enemies.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
They did mention that.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
That's awesome.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
So, we shall see.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
Except now, since GameCube doesn't really have a Z-trigger,

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
it's now L-targeting.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
It's the L button.

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
Lastly, for you guys tonight,

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
a story about another GameCube game,

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
and I know you guys are excited about this.

33:03.000 --> 33:07.000
Namco has announced, for the GameCube,

33:07.000 --> 33:11.000
Hello Kitty Roller Rescue.

33:11.000 --> 33:15.000
Does she show me the 42 pressure points of death?

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
I don't think so.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
However, she will be rendered in full 3D

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
along with her Sanrio character friends.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
In Roller Rescue, Hello Kitty and her friends

33:24.000 --> 33:28.000
must save Sanrio Town from an alien invasion

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
because the king of the block planet, Blocko,

33:31.000 --> 33:35.000
is going to send troops to Earth to liberate.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Stop. Stop. Hold on a second.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
Blocko, wasn't that from Gumby?

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
I don't know. I don't know.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
Those were the block heads.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Whatever. It's all the same.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
Hello Kitty will be joined by 20 other Sanrio characters,

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
including my favorite, that's Maru, and Karopi.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
You know, I bet if they're going to be aliens

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
then we're going to have the twin stars.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
This is interesting because if you think about it now,

33:57.000 --> 34:03.000
Namco has Gumby, Popeye, Peanuts, and Hello Kitty.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
Yeah, but Sanrio already had licenses to do.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
Oh my god. They need to do like a Super Smash Brothers

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
with all these characters.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
I got it right now.

34:10.000 --> 34:13.000
Franchise fighting revolution.

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
You know what, we're going to get another Super Robot Wars

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
starring Hello Kitty.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
Oh my god, they need to remake that game that was by Sega

34:20.000 --> 34:24.000
where you had like the Daytona car fighting a cactus fighting.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
Fighters Megamix.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Yeah, Fighters Megamix.

34:27.000 --> 34:32.000
It was all about playing with the two random Sonic fighters people.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
Alright.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
I actually have Fighters Megamix.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
That's cool.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Alright, that's going to do it for another podcast.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Final thought, Loki.

34:41.000 --> 34:46.000
I don't want to pack anymore.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
Shut up.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
Packing, huh?

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
I'm packing boxes, I need to, you know,

34:51.000 --> 34:57.000
fill them full of my wonderful computer parts and junk.

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
My final thought is beef.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
Dark Sakura.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
Reject false icons.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
Set Britney Spears on fire.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
We will see you guys next time.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
Thanks for listening.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
Thanks for listening, you guys.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
We do appreciate your guys' support.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
We'll see you next time.

35:14.000 --> 35:17.000
Watch Robot Chicken.

35:17.000 --> 35:21.000
That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

35:21.000 --> 35:27.000
