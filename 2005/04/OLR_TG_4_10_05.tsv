445	3667	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of April 11th, 2005.
4007	14512	You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
14793	18314	Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
19515	20696	Yes, that's right.
21676	23957	A little new sound there, a little bit of a new intro there.
24918	26239	The Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition.
26259	28700	I thought we'd change things up a little bit around here.
29212	30953	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
30993	35654	Joining me as always, my awesome co-host here with me to talk about video games that don't suck.
36014	38315	Say hello to Jamie, also known as DarkSakura.
39375	41336	There's plenty of games out there that suck.
41756	43136	Avoid them, please.
43777	44857	Please, we beg you to.
44957	46217	Don't give them any more money.
47378	49979	And also with us, as always, say hello to Loki.
50699	52019	Hi, I'm here again.
52419	52979	Yes, you are.
53380	53580	Yes.
54060	57181	Alright, so you notice we kind of changed things a little bit there in the intro.
57281	57601	You know...
58863	74389	I'm sure as a lot of you have noticed, we haven't been talking a whole lot about rhythm and music games here on the podcast, so we kind of thought we'd refocus ourselves a little bit and tell you guys what we're really all about, and that's just kind of general video gaming, what gamers really want to know about.
75749	81452	Now, if you're a DDR fan, don't get upset, because we're still going to talk about rhythm and music games plenty on this show.
81492	86934	When we find out that a lot of stuff is going on, new stuff in the world, we will bring it to you as soon as we find out.
86974	87394	But for now...
88106	88627	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
107816	108517	No, I don't.
108697	110859	I usually delete all the stupid games off of my cell phone.
111199	114041	Have you seen some of those games you can download on the cell phone, though?
114161	115122	I have Bejeweled on my phone.
115643	117144	I know we were talking about this a little bit last week.
117164	121007	Remember we were talking about it on the last podcast about the Chinese cell phone games that you can get?
121027	122408	They're just like, you can get Life Force.
123409	124490	And you can get them in Japan.
125160	126921	I want that Final Fantasy VII game.
127341	127702	Heck yeah.
127742	128722	The Turks game.
128762	129263	Heck yeah.
129583	136688	But, you know, the best thing we get, you know, I have Impossible Mission, which was, don't get me wrong, one of the greatest Commodore 64 games of all time.
137068	138569	But it sucks on the cell phone.
138609	139529	You can't even see the room.
139549	141571	They do have Gradius for the US phone, I found out.
141631	144032	But it's not for anything, I think, that we have.
144733	147655	And they, um... Shoot, there was, uh...
148880	151641	A game that I was thinking when you said Impossible Mission.
151661	155163	I was thinking they should put Incredible Crisis on the cell phone.
155483	156083	That would be cool.
156223	158224	I don't know if it would have all the music on there, though.
158784	160025	Who knows what technology is.
160505	161485	So, any other games?
161665	161946	That's it?
161986	162466	Just cell phones?
163006	163586	That's really it.
163986	164227	All right.
164507	164807	Fair enough.
164887	165727	Loki, what have you been up to?
166027	167428	I've been playing my PSP.
168849	169329	What did I do?
169489	169709	I was...
170285	181249	Mainly playing Wipeout Pure only because my boss was borrowing the Twisted Metal head-on because he doesn't have any games for his, so I felt bad for him, so I loaned him that for a few days.
182189	184130	So I've been playing Wipeout Pure, and it's pretty fun.
185430	188771	Actually, I hated Wipeout, and I don't know.
189852	192073	It's nice right now while I have one game.
192113	196314	I'm getting more games coming in on Monday, so I'll have Luminous and Ridge Racer finally.
197556	204242	and then 512 megabyte memory sticks so I can put all my pirated episodes of Robot Chicken on there.
204823	205603	That's my favorite.
207064	214391	Then the other game I got was Zookeeper for the DS and I can see why I didn't get it before because it's kind of annoying.
214611	218954	Like I actually had to turn the background music off on it because it was that annoying.
218974	220716	It just repeated like every five seconds.
220796	221837	It's just awful.
222805	229447	Now, I've been checking out Zookeepers, too, since you picked it up, which basically, Zookeeper is just bejeweled on the DS.
229867	230748	Yeah, it's pretty.
231008	234249	Like, one minor change, the animal theme, and that's about it.
234749	235609	So it's basically bejeweled.
235949	243932	Doesn't it feel like one of those games that was really rushed to come out just because there are no other games out on the DS, so they know people would buy it?
244272	244972	Yes, exactly.
244992	245432	That's what it is.
245612	247153	Because there's, like, no depth to it.
247173	250734	It's just like, ooh, it's a game I can pick up, play for a little bit, and I'm done.
251557	252337	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
272793	274315	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
294397	296999	I think I played it for about five minutes, and I was like, I've played this game before.
297359	299181	Bejeweled 2 is cooler than Zookeeper.
299441	301082	Why don't they put Bejeweled 2 on the DS?
301142	303244	At least you got, like, the super jewels and things like that.
303804	309129	And it's got, like, a better theme, whereas Zookeeper gets... You know, the bleeps and bloops.
309169	310230	It sounds like Atari 2600.
310510	311070	It's hella annoying.
311511	317235	The other game I got to check out this week, thanks to Loki, actually, managed to snag me a copy of Doom 3 on the Xbox.
317856	321559	Which, you know, I have to admit, I wasn't really interested in Doom 3 at all.
321739	321939	I mean...
322600	327543	I guess it's hard because I really liked Doom and Doom 2 when they were out years ago.
327883	331264	You remember how they were like the first, like, first-person games?
331284	334546	They were kind of like this sequel to Wolfenstein in a way.
334666	337768	In a way, not really, but they were kind of like the next evolution of Wolfenstein.
337828	339589	It was Wolfenstein with ramps.
340129	341089	Well, not really ramps, actually.
341109	341990	And then multiplayer.
342657	343558	Which was really cool.
343998	348542	Well, you remember, if you ever created your own maps in Wolfenstein, it's very 2D.
348882	352324	Wolfenstein is really, it's like you take a 2D level and you put yourself in it.
352685	353545	I remember doing that.
353966	355507	Doom was very 3D.
355587	357548	And it had the Wolfenstein level.
358529	358889	It did.
358909	360931	You had to do the level skip code, but you could get there.
360951	365014	I believe it was level 40-something.
365174	365634	I remember.
365654	368857	It was one of the levels that Wolfenstein was actually in Doom.
368897	369337	It was cool.
369457	369597	Yep.
371079	372100	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
387782	389684	I was actually pleasantly surprised with Doom 3.
390505	393027	It's quite more to it than I thought.
393147	395809	It's not like the other Dooms where you just jump in, start shooting.
396029	397130	Even Halo is a lot like that.
397190	402215	Sure, Halo has its big cinematic opening, but it's kind of really just jump in, start shooting.
403444	410686	But Halo 2, anyway, has where you can take the vehicles and completely abandon the game and fly around and go places you're not supposed to go.
410806	413467	There's plenty of differences between Halo 2 and Doom 3.
413667	419789	I'm not going to try and compare the two, but I'm just kind of, you know, I think a lot of times because they're first-person shooters, we kind of inadvertently compare them.
420149	420790	Doom 3 Doom 2 Doom 3
445214	446054	It's really scary.
446074	450356	There's like bodies hanging from ceilings and zombies that jump up from the floor and stuff.
450396	451416	It's pretty freaky.
451736	452696	I need to see this.
452776	453356	I really do.
453376	454317	I'm going to have to show it to you.
454337	454657	It's pretty cool.
454677	455877	Wasn't it on PC as well?
456077	456157	Yes.
456197	460338	It actually started on PC, but Xbox has... I think I have it somewhere hanging around my house.
460538	463599	The cool thing about Doom 3 on Xbox is it has the Xbox Live stuff in it.
463779	466100	Although I don't know anybody else with the game, so I can't play anybody yet.
466140	468901	Yeah, and they'll see the other thing is that it runs on your...
469361	470061	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
490467	520113	but like in this one you can actually walk up to it and then zoom in and it seamlessly is zooming in and you actually can see like a number pad that you have to punch in an access code to get through the door it's crazy pretty insane yeah it's a high level of detail I like it anyway so that's pretty much my gaming well that and there's like these panels that you walk around that like have video playing it's like an actual like video talking about the whole facility welcome to Mars and don't get killed welcome to Recall
521417	523358	Alright, let's start off with some gaming news tonight.
523378	526881	We'll actually talk about another game that's on its way towards Xbox.
527521	532124	This is an update for an old classic comic strip, and this was a game of one time as well.
532144	532724	I remember this one.
532945	534365	You remember Spy vs. Spy?
535666	538688	Oh my god, I have Spy vs. Spy comics in my bathroom.
538788	540509	Exactly, Mad Magazine, right?
540529	541530	And then it spun off.
541750	544372	But it was an old school Commodore 64 game too.
544392	545232	Yeah, it came out on the NES.
545252	546433	Yeah, it was on the NES as well.
546513	548334	I remember there were like three versions on the Commodore.
548354	549035	It was an awesome game.
549577	550257	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
568664	570265	You go across the games, 12 levels.
570626	572627	There's weapons, booby traps, and gadgets.
572687	575289	It kind of sounds very similar to the other one.
575689	579752	The other cool thing about Spy vs. Spy, though, and I always like it when game companies do this, it's a $19.99 title.
579792	582655	So they're starting this off as a budget title.
582675	586577	And there's a reason why it's $19.99, because you get what you pay for, people.
586898	589760	Hey, we paid $19.99 for Katamari Damacy.
589800	590901	That's right.
591041	591661	Yeah, that's right.
591761	592402	But you know what?
592422	594763	That was one of those exceptions to the rule, okay?
594844	597826	I thought Technic Beat, which came out at the same time, was very cool as well.
598286	599327	Maybe a 29 game.
599987	600467	Come on, Rob.
600487	602188	This is Spy vs. Spy, okay?
602388	604229	Spy vs. Spy for the NES sucked.
604389	610212	I have a fond place in my heart for the Spy vs. Spy Commodore games, because I was a kid when those were out, and it was great.
610472	611413	Horrible reviews.
611613	613814	I don't even think anyone actually wanted to review this game.
613874	614694	Well, I'll tell you, though.
614734	618236	Well, here's the thing that might make you go kind of, uh, maybe this is a crappy game.
618276	618837	Don't know yet, though.
619217	621138	PlayStation 2 version got canceled.
621918	622699	They decided not to do it.
624339	625340	Seems very interesting, hmm?
626736	629638	I think I would have to get Spy vs. Spy just because.
629658	631299	Yeah, I know.
631339	634880	It'd be the just because factor, and I'd get it for 30% off anyway.
634900	636021	Someone should send me a free one.
636401	637001	I like that idea.
637262	638302	I'll just get it for cheap.
638742	644505	If you have a free copy of Spy vs. Spy you want to send us, togo, T-O-G-O, at orangelaunchradio.com.
644525	646206	In fact, you could really write us about anything.
646506	648087	We'll read whatever emails you've got to send us.
651027	652728	Let's talk old school consoles for a minute.
652788	654408	I think this is really cool, this story.
654428	656509	It talks about the Atari 2600.
657489	660570	Can you believe there's still new Atari 2600 news after all these years?
661110	665331	Hey, people are still making ROMs for the 2600.
665411	666091	Well, you got it.
666191	666692	Here it is.
666852	667772	Retro Redo.
667852	671393	It was a 24-hour video game programming contest held...
671809	672870	Ninja Garden Ninja Garden
689989	690850	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
707443	708323	But, okay, whatever.
709444	713746	The prize is that this game, Ninja Garden, is going to be included in the next version of that.
714026	714526	Ah, pretty cool.
714546	716707	That's kind of the, you know, new secret game.
716988	723651	Truth be told, people, you could actually probably pull a chip out of one of those and actually flash any ROMs you want on there, but... Whatever.
723711	726412	Not that we encourage you to break your warranty and do that.
726472	728593	Oh, come on, I'm working on a $20 item.
728633	729153	Woo!
729173	730074	Gotta replace that one.
730314	732275	Are they releasing that thing with the whip handling?
733408	734429	No, it's not.
734769	738231	You know it's not the old wood panel style we had way back in the day.
738251	739152	It's the kind that I have.
739192	740273	It's the cheap plastic.
740313	741574	The third release one, right?
741614	741914	Exactly.
742534	744796	Well, I don't even know if it exactly looks like one of those.
747758	750680	From old system to very new system, PSP.
751140	753302	A lot of folks were saying, oh, it sold great.
753322	755163	It's the best system ever in sales.
755223	757405	And some people were saying, disappointing.
758129	765336	Well, the first week sales figures are out now, and the PSP sold 600,000 units in its first week.
766838	768880	You know what that equates to?
769000	770722	About $150 million.
771362	773905	Good, then Sony will be able to pay that $90 million off.
774606	776768	Yeah, in that lawsuit we were talking about.
777549	778790	We'll see, we'll see about that one.
779711	779971	All right.
781393	785755	Also, in other handheld gaming news, Nintendo's got this DS.
786015	787936	You might have heard of this new game on the way for the DS.
787976	789177	It's called Electroplankton.
789717	790958	I don't know if you've heard about this at all.
791698	792239	They have like...
793632	795233	I thought there was a website for this or something.
813368	815950	But they're doing an interesting promotion here, Nintendo is.
815990	823757	What they're going to be doing, they're actually going to have like an aquarium exhibition hall at this Tokyo show from April 8th to 14th.
824177	826420	Entrance is free and you get to see the whole thing.
827060	834947	And the cool thing about this is Nintendo's going to be giving away only 10 limited edition electroplankton DS units.
835948	836649	Should be interesting.
837734	843436	And by the looks of it, it pretty much looks exactly like a normal DS, except there's this little sticker on it.
844277	845377	It might be an engraving, though.
845617	846858	An engraving, whatever.
847098	848519	That's the lighting.
848619	852480	But anyways, it's just... It's actually what that is.
852520	853401	It is an engraving.
853461	855582	It's the original electroplankton artwork.
856162	856282	So...
856946	860468	So whoever's going to get that, they're going to put it on friggin' eBay, and it's going to sell for a lot.
860488	860849	Yay.
861069	861469	We'll see.
861849	862209	We'll see.
862610	869494	Speaking of Nintendo, you know how we have in San Francisco, now we, you know, we based our show out of Sacramento, so San Francisco's just a drive up the road.
869934	873897	And in San Francisco, they have the official Sony PlayStation Store at the Sony Metron.
873917	875158	You've been there before, right, DarkSakura?
875338	875878	Yeah.
875938	876519	It's fun, huh?
876559	877419	It's a big geek place.
877659	878040	Oh, yeah.
878060	879561	The whole Metron is just geek central.
879761	879961	It's cool.
879981	880821	And with overpriced games.
881142	881922	And overpriced food.
882282	884024	But still, it's fun, you know.
884364	884564	Well...
885262	889665	If you're on the other coast, there's a gaming company that's going to be doing something similar for you guys.
889825	892808	In New York City, New York City!
893268	893808	Get a rope!
894149	898832	Rockefeller Center will soon be home to the Nintendo World Store.
899332	904396	A two-story complex, Mario, Zelda, Nintendo, you think of it.
904536	908559	Also, the location will host the brand new Pokemon Center.
910020	910961	Joy, joy, joy.
912145	914966	Can we leave our kids there, put them in Pokeball?
915346	916406	People are going to do that anyway.
916566	917426	You know it's going to happen.
918187	919227	Go play, kid!
919767	927269	I'm really surprised they're not doing it in Seattle since the Nintendo headquarters is just north of Tacoma.
927329	928970	That is kind of surprising to me.
929090	932431	But, you know, it's fun to try stuff on the other coast, too.
932471	935692	I mean, we get spoiled here on the West Coast sometimes with all these technology things.
936272	937352	I'm not complaining.
937712	938952	I grew up in Alabama.
939273	940093	I'm not complaining.
941718	942398	I was going to say, you know what?
942418	947241	It's also over, well, not exactly on the East Coast, but the West Coast by the, you know, Microsoft.
947261	949143	You know, they've got to have their, you know.
949203	949683	Yeah.
949903	950543	So this is the thing.
950603	957168	Okay, if Sony has chosen San Francisco and Nintendo has chosen New York, where's Microsoft going to go?
958849	959829	Hopefully Alaska.
959849	960610	Seattle.
960890	962191	Hopefully Alaska.
962311	962791	No, I'm kidding.
963171	963531	I'm kidding.
964832	965553	The South Pole.
965913	966854	Probably L.A.
966874	967874	Yeah.
968114	968495	Who knows?
968835	969195	We'll see.
970556	970736	Now,
971092	973853	Jamie, I know you're a big fan of Namco, the company, right?
974194	975474	Why are you such a fan of Namco?
975534	976195	I worked for them.
976755	978476	Oh, so you still have a lot of company loyalty?
979496	981898	I had the coolest uniform shirt ever.
982338	984519	It was red and black and had Pac-Man on it.
986540	987681	What's the coolest thing about Namco?
988921	990002	Anything Tekken related.
990322	990602	All right.
991342	996145	Well, what's actually coming out on the PlayStation 2 is Nam Collection.
997129	998510	They've actually pushed this back, though.
998530	1002232	It was going to come out in Japan on June 2nd, but it actually got pushed back a little bit.
1002613	1003753	What is the NAMM collection?
1003813	1006695	It's going to be five classic PlayStation games.
1006996	1013820	It's going to be Ridge Racer, Ace Combat 2, Kelowna, Mr. Driller, and Tekken.
1014560	1015241	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
1015461	1016021	Klonoa.
1016542	1017182	Sorry, Klonoa.
1017642	1019844	Well, this is like one of the most awesome platformers ever.
1019984	1020164	Yes.
1021134	1028059	The compilation is also going to have a gallery mode and movies with tips and tricks on how to get through the game.
1028380	1033323	You remember on the old PlayStation they had the N-A-M-C-O, all that libraries.
1033784	1037046	It sounds like they're doing that all over again, but now for the newer games.
1037086	1040569	Because PlayStation, believe it or not, is getting to be like 10 years old.
1041229	1042030	It's kind of sad.
1042050	1047354	You know, this sounds like a desperate attempt at money.
1048240	1049581	Well, isn't everything?
1049601	1050141	I mean, come on.
1050501	1052522	If you want to play Tekken, go buy Tekken 5.
1052742	1054803	I mean, because you have no Tekken in there.
1054983	1055364	That's true.
1055644	1061867	But it's just like, okay, it's like how Nintendo released those retro games that are available on the Advance.
1062187	1064228	And one of the games you can buy is Metroid.
1065074	1090784	But hello, spend ten more dollars and you could get Metroid Zero Mission Which has Metroid in it Yeah And is a great game outside of that Or all those other like classic games that you could actually download via Animal Crossing That too, a lot of games that you could just get on Animal Crossing It's just ridiculous, but hey folks that buy, you know, the Nintendo products They like to shell out money for the same thing over and over and over again, so why not?
1091824	1094425	Retro holds a place in many people's hearts though, it really does
1095967	1120477	Orange Lounge Radio to go to show we're not here just to talk about games all the time because you know if we talked about games all the time we'd have no time to go clubbing so what we're here to do as well as we're here to better your life and who better to give you some advice on how to better your life than our very own Dark Sakura with her advice column and Jamie what are you going to tell the kids about tonight
1122549	1126171	Well, this one I think is very, very useful.
1126911	1128672	One that everybody needs to know.
1129592	1130072	And what's this?
1130472	1131913	How to treat a bullet or knife wound.
1132233	1132733	Ah, okay.
1133374	1141857	Because, you know, it always happens when you get in one of those heated soul caliber battles where someone ends up getting cut in the end.
1142477	1143518	So, this is good to know.
1144638	1146019	Well, you ready?
1146619	1146999	Of course.
1147700	1151021	Number one, do not immediately pull out any impaled objects.
1151724	1152486	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1162745	1163605	Oh, unfortunately.
1187216	1195123	Control the bleeding by using a combination of direct pressure, limb elevation, pressure points, and tourniquets in that order.
1195644	1196945	Immobilize the injured area.
1197485	1205112	Using splints and dressings to immobilize an injured area helps protect from further injury and maintain clots that have begun to form.
1205212	1208815	Dress the wound and strive to prevent infection.
1209696	1211598	That means dump a bottle of vodka on their legs.
1212757	1215238	Um, five, get medical attention as soon as possible.
1215638	1217358	But of course, you know what I always say in the end.
1217498	1217718	Yes?
1217979	1219479	Don't get shot, stupid!
1220079	1220439	Duck!
1223020	1224941	Thank you very much for that lovely piece of advice.
1225081	1228962	Well, it's, people, if bullets are flying, freaking hide.
1230022	1233023	If somebody runs a gun, or if somebody pulls a gun, you run!
1233323	1233903	Like a little bitch.
1234143	1234723	Exactly.
1234923	1236484	Of course, you could usually end up getting shot in the back.
1238384	1239245	You won't care!
1239265	1240485	Be careful.
1242116	1247400	Speaking of getting shot, you remember how the Godfather, the movie, had a game come out pretty recently?
1248140	1249721	They made like the Godfather game.
1250501	1255244	Well, did you know that the Godfather game did not have everybody's blessing in coming out?
1255304	1257866	In fact, some people are quite irritated about this game coming out.
1258186	1260507	You know who one of the folks is that's pretty irritated about it?
1261548	1266131	Francis Ford Coppola, who made the damn movies, is not happy about this.
1267515	1277618	So, you know, he's actually expressed his displeasure with Paramount Pictures because they ended up selling the rights out.
1278378	1283280	He's actually going to talk about this on an AMC show called Sunday Morning Shootout.
1283300	1284000	This is what he says.
1284600	1285500	I knew nothing about it.
1285780	1287841	They never asked me if I thought it was a good idea.
1288181	1289141	They use the characters.
1289321	1289981	Everyone knows.
1290262	1292262	And then for the next hour, they shoot and kill each other.
1292362	1295283	I had absolutely nothing to do with this game, and I disapprove.
1296218	1298980	Well, yeah, that's why they didn't tell you about it, because it's going to suck.
1299461	1299901	Sure.
1301002	1302403	Like, you'd actually approve that.
1303704	1304364	That's the whole point.
1304384	1306266	I mean, it's never going to work out.
1306846	1307767	But, hey, that's all right.
1307847	1309689	We'll have a nice Grand Theft Auto clone.
1312271	1313211	Uh, Phantasy Star.
1314032	1315473	Some of you guys have played this out there.
1315493	1317815	I know you used to play this a while ago, DarkSakura.
1318075	1318355	A bit.
1318435	1319456	I've played it on and off.
1319496	1323619	It seems like I can never keep going with Phantasy Star online enough to go past, like, level 10 or 11.
1325134	1325934	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1355467	1362051	So hopefully it will have nothing to do with Phantasy Star Online Volume 3, which was like the card game.
1362811	1363792	Which was the suck.
1364012	1366313	Hopefully it'll go back to the regular one.
1366353	1367213	We need Blue Burst.
1368534	1376018	The single player campaign is expected to clock in at roughly 40 hours of play with three planets to explore and new enemies to fight.
1376398	1380220	Gamers no longer have to go around on foot because there's actually going to be vehicles in the game.
1381861	1383622	And of course there's going to be the online mode.
1383882	1384243	Of course.
1384623	1384963	Has to be.
1387196	1390237	You know, I never really got into the old school Phantasy Star games.
1390297	1391257	I really wish I had.
1391597	1396299	Because I'm curious, does Phantasy Star Online actually have anything in common with the older Phantasy Stars?
1397119	1402861	There's some things, but there's like the Newman class, you know, or race.
1402941	1406802	There's the Meseta, there's all the, you know, currency.
1406942	1408363	Okay, so some little things.
1408783	1410023	It's got some things, yeah.
1410603	1412264	But, you know...
1413473	1416914	They released the Sega Ages Collection in the States, right?
1417294	1417774	Oh, really?
1417994	1419574	And it had the Phantasy Star.
1419594	1421655	You know the one that I brought over that was all in Japanese?
1421675	1422175	Yeah, I remember that.
1422195	1425476	It was the Fantasy Zone you brought over, right?
1425516	1431437	I brought over Fantasy Zone and Space Harrier, but we also have Phantasy Star.
1431957	1432477	Oh, very cool.
1432517	1433377	And they have this in the U.S.
1433417	1433557	now.
1433777	1433977	Yeah.
1434097	1434597	I was not aware.
1434697	1436738	But it's like a collection now that you can get for like $30.
1436778	1436878	Yeah.
1437731	1438931	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1461167	1462649	It's definitely coming out in the U.S.
1462690	1467898	because they have launched the North American website for Final Fantasy VII Advent Children.
1467958	1471143	It's na.square-enix.com DVD FF7AC
1476471	1481892	So it's coming out, and you can actually download the US trailer on here, and it's definitely going to be coming out.
1481932	1482712	Here's the interesting thing.
1483072	1487033	Not just out on DVD, but also will be coming out UMD.
1487353	1487953	UMD, yep.
1488693	1489373	Very interesting.
1489593	1503496	Also announced, I'm not sure if you're going to cover this, but Crisis Core, which is another, it's going to be a PSP game that's going to be tying in with the whole, I forget what they're calling it, like the whole series of Final Fantasy VII stuff.
1503976	1504376	Very cool.
1504416	1505156	Is that the one with Vincent?
1505899	1507240	No, that's something else.
1507280	1508221	There's so many of them now.
1508241	1513286	It's like for forever, people were saying, you know, oh, there needs to be a sequel to Final Fantasy VII.
1513326	1513826	Oh, there needs to be.
1513866	1515587	And now suddenly it's like we're getting too many.
1516028	1517129	I can't keep track of them all.
1519815	1521777	All right, so hopefully soon we'll be seeing this.
1521817	1523998	Of course, not going to have a theatrical release.
1524058	1526000	It's only going to be a DVD and UMD release.
1526080	1535167	But what is interesting about this is that they actually announced in Japan, Squeenix announced that they're going to be doing a special limited edition version.
1535587	1536868	Of course, that's the way to go.
1536928	1540851	You know, you release the regular one and they release a special edition for $20 more.
1540871	1544795	Of course, they haven't really said what's going to be in this special edition.
1544835	1545235	It's just...
1545856	1549359	Bonus merchandise not available in the normal edition.
1550580	1553302	Wow, how specific.
1554123	1556865	Hopefully we'll get more details on that in the next few weeks.
1558706	1561028	And lastly tonight, I thought we could close on a story.
1561589	1570936	Funny enough, even though I said we're not going to be putting the rhythm of music games in our podcast intro anymore because we talk about all sorts of other stuff, I actually have a DDR story to talk about at the end here.
1570976	1571697	Isn't that ironic?
1573538	1574479	A little too ironic.
1575342	1576202	It's like rain.
1576382	1577603	Okay.
1578083	1579183	West Virginia.
1580064	1583885	They've got the Public Employees Insurance Agency.
1584545	1594209	What they're doing, they've recruited 85 children to take part in a study aimed at reducing costs associated with covering obesity claims for its clients.
1595249	1602872	What the study is doing is it's using DDR and it's trying to see if there's a possibility to encourage weight loss via DDR at an early age.
1604607	1605508	P.E.I.A.
1606749	1611632	Health Promotions Manager Nydia Henderson says, Today's kids are tomorrow's members.
1611792	1614794	Obesity claims last year cost us $77 million.
1615174	1616715	We have to curtail these costs.
1617255	1618336	The study is budgeted at $60,000.
1618977	1620257	And hey, guess what?
1620277	1625641	If you're one of the 85 fat kids in this program, you get a free copy of a game system.
1626283	1628945	DDR, and a DDR dance pad.
1629105	1630166	All complimentary for this.
1630887	1640394	But, as a trade-off, if you're in the six-month program, you will have to play the game for a certain amount of time every day, and you have to wear a meter and do all these reports and stuff as well.
1640514	1641715	And you also have to sell your soul.
1642956	1644878	Just, you know, small text there.
1644958	1645859	To the Konami gods.
1647120	1652264	The insurance agency is also going to be using $10,000 to try the game out at 20 public schools.
1653164	1653785	Very interesting.
1655074	1662476	All this DDR news about how, you know, it's just taken off out there and people are using it for all these weight loss things and yet, still no new arcade mix.
1662936	1663597	Still not happening.
1664217	1664797	Oh, darn.
1664817	1666678	I think they're just forgetting something, aren't they?
1666778	1668698	Yeah, it's just like something's forgotten.
1668758	1674580	It seems like that whole fan base that helped DDR get big in the first place just suddenly, you know, forgotten.
1675100	1677861	Oh, well, we do get the home mixes with the eye toy and all that.
1677921	1678921	Oh, that, yeah.
1679041	1680722	Yeah, but, you know, no new arcade things for you.
1681851	1684214	And the arcade mix would get me totally back in the arcade.
1684254	1690219	I would be there in a heartbeat, especially if it was by the folks that did Ultramix 2, which is by far the best DDR home release they've done, in my opinion.
1690920	1691520	But what do I know?
1691560	1694363	I'm just some dumb podcast guy on the internet.
1695384	1697566	We're internet celebrities!
1698307	1704452	From all us internet celebrity podcasters to you guys, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio To Go.
1705033	1707275	Dark Sakura, your closing thought for us tonight.
1708675	1711438	If you can't be an athlete, be an athletic supporter.
1723373	1724933	And now Xbox signed up with a marketing campaign.
1724953	1727454	It's just, you know, they're all trying to one-up each other.
1727474	1728214	We'll see what happens.
1728234	1728594	Yeah.
1750598	1752359	Alright, anyways.
1752540	1758324	And my final thought is the Froger contains potassium benzoate.
1760065	1760466	Special.
1760846	1761927	Alright, that's going to do it.
1761967	1764569	See you guys next time here on the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition.
1765630	1769212	That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition.
1769513	1776498	This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com See you next update.
