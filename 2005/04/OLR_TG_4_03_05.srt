00:00:00,552 --> 00:00:04,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of April 4th, 2005.

2
00:00:05,615 --> 00:00:08,757
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition.

3
00:00:09,057 --> 00:00:15,561
[SPEAKER_00]: Your internet radio home for discussion on rhythm and music gaming and all the news on video games that don't suck.

4
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:20,343
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

5
00:00:21,404 --> 00:00:23,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everybody on the internet.

6
00:00:24,766 --> 00:00:27,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to another edition of the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition.

7
00:00:29,717 --> 00:00:31,458
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on in the video gaming world?

8
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:39,303
[SPEAKER_02]: And with you is myself, my name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky, and my lovely co-host Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.

9
00:00:39,683 --> 00:00:40,843
[SPEAKER_03]: I am such a celebrity.

10
00:00:41,824 --> 00:00:44,825
[SPEAKER_02]: And our other third wheel, say hello to Loki.

11
00:00:45,906 --> 00:00:46,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

12
00:00:47,367 --> 00:00:47,707
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

13
00:00:48,362 --> 00:00:58,931
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to talk about some gaming news going on in the world, and of course, tons of PSP stuff, because, you know, this PSP has been this gigantic, like, Katamari Dimash-y ball just rolling down a hill.

14
00:00:59,652 --> 00:01:01,013
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what's popular this week.

15
00:01:01,073 --> 00:01:01,814
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the big thing.

16
00:01:02,134 --> 00:01:05,917
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll talk about some PSP news, but first, what's going on in your gaming world, DarkSakura?

17
00:01:07,198 --> 00:01:15,205
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing a lot of the games on the Gorillas.com site, like Widescreen Pong and Helidrop.

18
00:01:16,178 --> 00:01:17,018
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been pretty fun.

19
00:01:17,218 --> 00:01:19,039
[SPEAKER_02]: So no, like, consoles or anything?

20
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,741
[SPEAKER_03]: I looked at Final Fantasy XI.

21
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:23,261
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't actually play it, though.

22
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:23,801
[SPEAKER_02]: You looked at it.

23
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:24,482
[SPEAKER_02]: You just checked it out.

24
00:01:24,502 --> 00:01:26,002
[SPEAKER_03]: I moved my play online icon.

25
00:01:27,663 --> 00:01:28,664
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been too busy.

26
00:01:28,824 --> 00:01:29,944
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been doing other stuff.

27
00:01:30,204 --> 00:01:32,145
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, being a famous internet celebrity.

28
00:01:32,765 --> 00:01:34,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you move it to the recycle bin?

29
00:01:34,626 --> 00:01:35,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Or where did you move the icon?

30
00:01:37,027 --> 00:01:37,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Elsewhere.

31
00:01:37,968 --> 00:01:38,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

32
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,529
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's it?

33
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:41,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a lot of games anymore?

34
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:42,950
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't be bothered with that kind of thing anymore.

35
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,711
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a famous internet celebrity.

36
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:44,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

37
00:01:45,282 --> 00:01:46,303
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot, I'm so sorry.

38
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:47,844
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it?

39
00:01:49,326 --> 00:01:50,246
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm busy being famous.

40
00:01:51,307 --> 00:01:52,869
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki!

41
00:01:53,409 --> 00:01:55,011
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought a PSP.

42
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:56,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Sucker!

43
00:01:56,592 --> 00:01:57,613
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's cool.

44
00:01:57,913 --> 00:01:59,354
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could afford it, I'd buy one too.

45
00:01:59,535 --> 00:02:00,455
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm with the trends.

46
00:02:01,556 --> 00:02:03,318
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I got a PSP and I got two games.

47
00:02:03,338 --> 00:02:05,460
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the Wipeout Pure just because...

48
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:08,151
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to hack my PSP.

49
00:02:08,612 --> 00:02:09,632
[SPEAKER_02]: You bought Wipeout, period.

50
00:02:09,652 --> 00:02:12,793
[SPEAKER_02]: It has nothing to do with the fact that you like Wipeout.

51
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:16,374
[SPEAKER_02]: I distinctly remember you saying you were disappointed with the Wipeout series.

52
00:02:16,914 --> 00:02:18,294
[SPEAKER_01]: I hated Wipeout, actually.

53
00:02:18,474 --> 00:02:23,096
[SPEAKER_02]: But you just wanted to buy it because you know it's the game that allows people to hack their PSPs.

54
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:24,476
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

55
00:02:24,576 --> 00:02:26,797
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like Wipeout now because I've been playing it.

56
00:02:26,917 --> 00:02:27,797
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually pretty fun.

57
00:02:28,217 --> 00:02:28,717
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

58
00:02:28,917 --> 00:02:31,998
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried Wipeout 3 a while back and I tried Wipeout XL.

59
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:33,038
[SPEAKER_01]: I just didn't get into it.

60
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:35,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, you know what?

61
00:02:35,563 --> 00:02:37,949
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to bring over my pair of Negcons.

62
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:40,375
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to play Wipeout with a Negcon.

63
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,761
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that?

64
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:46,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Namco Controller, the twisty one.

65
00:02:46,906 --> 00:02:49,007
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the one with the little dial is the JogCon.

66
00:02:49,707 --> 00:02:51,688
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a JogCon that's completely useless.

67
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:52,848
[SPEAKER_01]: I have like three JogCons.

68
00:02:53,588 --> 00:02:58,950
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I got Wipeout Pure and I got Twisted Metal head-on, I think.

69
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,950
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Twisted Metal.

70
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:04,451
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Twisted Metal head-on, though, is exactly like Twisted Metal 2.

71
00:03:04,671 --> 00:03:05,192
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all it is.

72
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:11,453
[SPEAKER_01]: But, hey, if you're going to make a remake of one of the original games, Twisted Metal 2 would be the one to do it, because that was one of the best.

73
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:12,934
[SPEAKER_01]: Why didn't you get Luminous?

74
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:16,305
[SPEAKER_01]: because they weren't selling Luminous and I can only afford two games.

75
00:03:16,465 --> 00:03:18,705
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, those were the two.

76
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:22,346
[SPEAKER_01]: It was either that or, you know, I get, like, some stupid NFL game or something.

77
00:03:23,146 --> 00:03:31,347
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, no thank you, I will take Twisted Metal Black, or not Black, Head On, and the White Belt here.

78
00:03:32,808 --> 00:03:34,128
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, so I've been playing those.

79
00:03:34,288 --> 00:03:34,648
[SPEAKER_01]: They're fun.

80
00:03:35,268 --> 00:03:38,969
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I do not like, um,

81
00:03:39,952 --> 00:03:42,653
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a huge fan of Darkstalkers.

82
00:03:42,673 --> 00:03:45,034
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really neat on the PSP.

83
00:03:45,074 --> 00:03:46,154
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take your word for it.

84
00:03:46,274 --> 00:03:46,774
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

85
00:03:46,794 --> 00:03:47,135
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like

86
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:20,115
[SPEAKER_01]: The other reason I got one, though, work-related, because my boss just got one, and I figured, you know, it'd be kind of cool to just, you know, play against him during, like, a break or something, or just to be able to actually play some of the games.

87
00:04:20,435 --> 00:04:26,218
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I want to drag it with me to E3, because you know they're going to have Wi-Fi hotspots there, and you know there's going to be, like, PSP crap there.

88
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:29,280
[SPEAKER_01]: So, might as well drag my portable systems with me.

89
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Brown-nosing with a PSP.

90
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:31,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.

91
00:04:32,142 --> 00:04:32,622
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

92
00:04:32,842 --> 00:04:33,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, great.

93
00:04:34,822 --> 00:04:41,944
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as what's going on in my gaming world, I was, you know, obviously, since Loki's my roommate, I was checking out his PSP a little bit, so I played a little bit of Wipeout as well.

94
00:04:42,264 --> 00:04:43,804
[SPEAKER_02]: I suck at Wipeout, though, so forget it.

95
00:04:45,105 --> 00:04:47,885
[SPEAKER_02]: But I kind of want a PSP, but I'm going to wait for some later games.

96
00:04:47,965 --> 00:04:52,927
[SPEAKER_02]: I really, really want Luminous, but it's not enough for me to justify spending so much money on a system at this point.

97
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:53,947
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe later.

98
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:58,708
[SPEAKER_01]: The one I want is actually, they have that cool one where you disable bombs.

99
00:04:58,728 --> 00:04:59,388
[SPEAKER_01]: That looked kind of neat.

100
00:05:00,032 --> 00:05:01,354
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember the name of that one offhand.

101
00:05:03,196 --> 00:05:03,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh well.

102
00:05:03,796 --> 00:05:05,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so I'll get a PSP eventually.

103
00:05:05,218 --> 00:05:06,099
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's very pretty.

104
00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:11,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I was watching Spider-Man, even though I've already seen Spider-Man 2 twice and didn't really want to watch it again.

105
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,767
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to see what the video looked like on there.

106
00:05:12,787 --> 00:05:13,708
[SPEAKER_02]: I was quite impressed.

107
00:05:14,215 --> 00:05:15,715
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to admit, it's pretty nice looking.

108
00:05:15,735 --> 00:05:18,956
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also, though, download video from your computer.

109
00:05:19,897 --> 00:05:22,478
[SPEAKER_02]: I was telling Loki he needs to put some pornography on there.

110
00:05:22,518 --> 00:05:25,859
[SPEAKER_03]: GameStop's going to be carrying the one gigabyte cards coming up soon.

111
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:31,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in order to download that stuff, I've got to buy an additional piece of crap that's got to go with it.

112
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,041
[SPEAKER_03]: You can just bring our cable over and you can borrow it.

113
00:05:34,538 --> 00:05:37,599
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to get me a 1 gig stick.

114
00:05:37,679 --> 00:05:40,340
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I'm not even... Because I don't know how much those 1 gig sticks are.

115
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,280
[SPEAKER_01]: What, they're like 200 some dollars or something?

116
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:42,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Yikes!

117
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Not necessarily.

118
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,001
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Best Buy was having them for about $130 something.

119
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:49,362
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, fuck that, because you know what?

120
00:05:49,662 --> 00:05:57,684
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually go out there and buy... There's a USB to Mini-B, which is the USB thing that's on top of the PSP.

121
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,814
[SPEAKER_01]: Adaptor for $13 and then hook up your wonderful flash drives.

122
00:06:01,854 --> 00:06:02,174
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what?

123
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:04,554
[SPEAKER_01]: My flash drive is like, you know, 128 megs right there.

124
00:06:05,054 --> 00:06:05,754
[SPEAKER_01]: And what, I bought that for $20?

125
00:06:06,035 --> 00:06:07,055
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck that.

126
00:06:07,095 --> 00:06:11,416
[SPEAKER_01]: Why the hell would I go spend, you know, tons of money to buy this, you know, proprietary crap?

127
00:06:11,656 --> 00:06:12,796
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good idea in theory.

128
00:06:12,856 --> 00:06:13,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I just hope it works.

129
00:06:13,536 --> 00:06:13,776
[SPEAKER_01]: In theory.

130
00:06:14,016 --> 00:06:14,636
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it works.

131
00:06:15,136 --> 00:06:17,317
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I'm just interested.

132
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:22,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now I've been like jumping on the Wi-Fi spots, you know, people that are neighbors and stuff that,

133
00:06:23,237 --> 00:06:26,221
[SPEAKER_01]: Have internet and then they put wireless routers without passwords on them.

134
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:27,342
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, this is my gaming week.

135
00:06:27,943 --> 00:06:28,143
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

136
00:06:28,383 --> 00:06:28,723
[SPEAKER_01]: That's alright.

137
00:06:30,153 --> 00:06:33,015
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead I picked up a new DS game.

138
00:06:33,315 --> 00:06:36,777
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, you know, I didn't want to spend $300 on a PSP, but I had to spend money.

139
00:06:36,837 --> 00:06:40,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, that money was burning a hole in my pocket because I just did my taxes and I'm getting money back and all that.

140
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:44,701
[SPEAKER_02]: So I instead decided to go out and buy a new game for the DS.

141
00:06:44,801 --> 00:06:48,263
[SPEAKER_02]: The unfortunate thing is that the DS really doesn't have a whole lot of games on it.

142
00:06:48,683 --> 00:06:53,305
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, I already have Mario 64 and I already have WarioWare Touch.

143
00:06:53,325 --> 00:06:54,146
[SPEAKER_02]: So what does that leave?

144
00:06:54,286 --> 00:06:54,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a whole lot.

145
00:06:55,226 --> 00:06:56,349
[SPEAKER_02]: I already have Field of Magic.

146
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:01,399
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was pretty much, it came down between Sprung and this other title, Yoshi Touch and Go.

147
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:02,862
[SPEAKER_02]: So I picked up Yoshi Touch and Go.

148
00:07:04,486 --> 00:07:05,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Not impressed.

149
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:06,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Not impressed.

150
00:07:07,486 --> 00:07:10,048
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

151
00:07:36,092 --> 00:07:37,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Touch and bye, as far as I'm concerned.

152
00:07:39,194 --> 00:07:40,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into some gaming news.

153
00:07:40,615 --> 00:07:43,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki found some fun little customizable things.

154
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,237
[SPEAKER_02]: One's for the Xbox and one's for the PSP.

155
00:07:45,278 --> 00:07:47,079
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you find, Loki, for the Xbox?

156
00:07:47,179 --> 00:07:50,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you happen to love Hello Kitty, like we all do.

157
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:50,801
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay!

158
00:07:51,337 --> 00:08:06,726
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, no, we all don't, but, you know, what a way to ruin a perfectly good Crystal, you know, Xbox case by shoving some stupid Hello Kitty crap on it for Hello Kitty Mission Rescue, the special edition Crystal console that you can get.

159
00:08:07,706 --> 00:08:20,053
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically... So, wait, wait, I just want to clarify, this isn't like a giant sticker you put on your existing Crystal console, which you can't even get in this country anyway, but it's a brand new Xbox that they're selling that is specifically Hello Kitty Mission Rescue.

160
00:08:20,073 --> 00:08:20,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

161
00:08:20,253 --> 00:08:22,535
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, with this crappy crystal... Cute!

162
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:27,639
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a crystal console, which is, like, really awesome, but... I don't know.

163
00:08:27,739 --> 00:08:38,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so, you know, before they had a pink Xbox, why you would buy an X... Yeah, because, you know, I've been really waiting for the Hello Kitty game to come out for me to buy an Xbox.

164
00:08:38,507 --> 00:08:40,629
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been the game that'll do it for me.

165
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:45,933
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, so they have this, you know, Hello Kitty crystal Xbox console that you can get.

166
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:46,093
[SPEAKER_01]: It's...

167
00:08:47,148 --> 00:08:51,730
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes with a crystal controller, which hopefully doesn't have this pink crap on it.

168
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,330
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Mission Rescue game for $99.

169
00:08:56,091 --> 00:08:59,272
[SPEAKER_01]: With the purchase of a selected Samsung LCD TV.

170
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:01,293
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can only get it in Singapore.

171
00:09:01,713 --> 00:09:02,693
[SPEAKER_01]: Or on eBay.

172
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Where people would be selling it from Singapore.

173
00:09:07,115 --> 00:09:07,695
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's that.

174
00:09:08,295 --> 00:09:11,136
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, if you are the wonderful celebrity...

175
00:09:11,894 --> 00:09:17,377
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been doing Simmons Jeweler Company made some accessories for the Sony PSP.

176
00:09:18,077 --> 00:09:29,383
[SPEAKER_01]: They debuted this at March 14th at the Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood, dubbed the Pret-A-PSP, whatever that's supposed to mean.

177
00:09:29,984 --> 00:09:38,168
[SPEAKER_01]: And it says that brought together some of the hottest names in fashion, other well-known designers, including Marc Jacobs, Diane... Wait, wait, wait, wait.

178
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,762
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a fashion show for PSPs.

179
00:09:41,302 --> 00:09:42,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I correct here?

180
00:09:42,664 --> 00:09:43,865
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I believe you're correct.

181
00:09:43,885 --> 00:09:44,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

182
00:09:44,846 --> 00:09:45,607
[SPEAKER_01]: That's stupid.

183
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:53,957
[SPEAKER_01]: The top models including Maggie Reiser, Kirstie Hume, and people we don't care about.

184
00:09:53,997 --> 00:09:55,738
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, no gamer cares about these people.

185
00:09:56,019 --> 00:10:01,662
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so showed off the newest trend in fashion by wearing the sexy, sleek PSP accessories with the latest looks and fall.

186
00:10:01,722 --> 00:10:05,564
[SPEAKER_02]: What I love about this is that it's bling for your PSP is really what it is.

187
00:10:05,624 --> 00:10:06,465
[SPEAKER_02]: It's bling bling.

188
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:07,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, look at this.

189
00:10:07,385 --> 00:10:13,369
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got this gold PSP and there's a whole other joke that can be made there about the golden PSP if anybody watches South Park.

190
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:18,913
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get the gold PSP and you get these bling, bling chains that hang from it.

191
00:10:19,954 --> 00:10:20,755
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tacky.

192
00:10:20,915 --> 00:10:27,360
[SPEAKER_03]: And you want to know what... And you want to know how much this costs, folks?

193
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:27,841
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, God.

194
00:10:28,822 --> 00:10:31,043
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this isn't going to be for the average user.

195
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,146
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why you'd want to buy one in the first place unless you're like some

196
00:10:34,611 --> 00:10:36,012
[SPEAKER_01]: Overpaid rapper with no taste.

197
00:10:37,153 --> 00:10:37,714
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be $35,000.

198
00:10:39,115 --> 00:10:42,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Woo!

199
00:10:43,158 --> 00:10:45,740
[SPEAKER_02]: $35,000 to make your PSP look like crap?

200
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:54,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, if I wanted to make the PSP look like crap, I could go to the craft store and buy, you know, sculpty plastic.

201
00:10:54,927 --> 00:10:55,327
[SPEAKER_01]: And paint it.

202
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:58,470
[SPEAKER_01]: It says A-list celebrities showed up to this.

203
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,031
[SPEAKER_01]: This is A-list...

204
00:11:01,192 --> 00:11:02,712
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how I know that, I just do.

205
00:11:02,732 --> 00:11:03,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry guys.

206
00:11:26,158 --> 00:11:31,323
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know who bought this, but I know that David Arquette was there, and I know he's a big gamer, so he might have bought this.

207
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:31,764
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

208
00:11:31,804 --> 00:11:32,525
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, though?

209
00:11:33,005 --> 00:11:36,869
[SPEAKER_01]: He was one that bought one of those pimped out DSs, I remember that.

210
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,011
[SPEAKER_01]: So, who knows?

211
00:11:39,272 --> 00:11:40,072
[SPEAKER_01]: More power to him.

212
00:11:40,253 --> 00:11:41,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Pimp my game system.

213
00:11:42,715 --> 00:11:44,977
[SPEAKER_01]: In other news... Yeah, let's hear some DS news.

214
00:11:45,097 --> 00:11:49,222
[SPEAKER_01]: In other news in the DS, the other portable game world, we've been saying this is going to happen.

215
00:11:50,446 --> 00:11:59,973
[SPEAKER_01]: It says the PassMe, which for those who don't know, it's this device that's actually made to be able to port your own code using the Game Boy code thingy.

216
00:12:00,193 --> 00:12:02,255
[SPEAKER_02]: And what websites is this all being documented on?

217
00:12:03,581 --> 00:12:04,982
[SPEAKER_01]: on DSLinux.org.

218
00:12:05,002 --> 00:12:08,245
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, they ported Linux to the DS.

219
00:12:08,705 --> 00:12:11,547
[SPEAKER_01]: The first alpha for it should be coming out in about a month, they say.

220
00:12:11,847 --> 00:12:12,688
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only a matter of time.

221
00:12:13,349 --> 00:12:14,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, why, why, why?

222
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,471
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, it's got a computer chip in it.

223
00:12:16,551 --> 00:12:17,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Linux can be installed on it.

224
00:12:17,972 --> 00:12:24,017
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you could probably guess, they're already attempting to port Linux to the PSP.

225
00:12:24,297 --> 00:12:25,798
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.

226
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm personally porting Linux to my toaster oven.

227
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:33,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, if Linux is so popular, why is it not outselling Windows?

228
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:41,587
[SPEAKER_02]: In other DS news, you know they did the new colored DSs in Japan?

229
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,908
[SPEAKER_02]: They have graphite black and pure white.

230
00:12:44,248 --> 00:12:51,052
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know we sit here and sometimes joke like, haha, Nintendo, you know, they just re-released the system in new colors to try and drive up sales.

231
00:12:51,072 --> 00:12:54,694
[SPEAKER_02]: But what kind of idiots actually buy the system all over again just for a new color?

232
00:12:55,182 --> 00:12:57,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let me put this in a little bit of perspective for you guys.

233
00:12:58,423 --> 00:13:05,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Sales for the week of March 21st to the March 27th, when these new colors debuted, 54,000 units in Japan.

234
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,207
[SPEAKER_02]: The previous week was only 21,000.

235
00:13:08,327 --> 00:13:11,328
[SPEAKER_02]: More than doubled the sales just by rolling out two new colors.

236
00:13:13,329 --> 00:13:20,392
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and this kind of matches with that bling PSP story that there are people out there that will buy the gaming system to match their purse.

237
00:13:21,138 --> 00:13:30,606
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what's sad is people don't realize that you can actually go and find the mods yourself and do this for like a lot cheaper than buying a brand new system or paying $35,000.

238
00:13:31,586 --> 00:13:33,027
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see what happens April 20th.

239
00:13:33,128 --> 00:13:39,413
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for $35,000 I can make an all-in-one gaming unit with its own built-in like keg or something, you know.

240
00:13:40,013 --> 00:13:40,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Why pay $35?

241
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:42,615
[SPEAKER_01]: I would pay for that.

242
00:13:42,695 --> 00:13:46,838
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, why pay $35,000 for like a golden PSP?

243
00:13:46,979 --> 00:13:48,520
[SPEAKER_03]: A gaming system with a keg.

244
00:13:49,111 --> 00:13:53,874
[SPEAKER_01]: Which as soon as you drop it will be $35,000 wasted.

245
00:13:54,655 --> 00:13:56,396
[SPEAKER_03]: A gaming system with a keg?

246
00:13:56,696 --> 00:13:59,077
[SPEAKER_02]: One day we'll be famous and spending that kind of money on gaming systems.

247
00:13:59,097 --> 00:14:00,038
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm already famous!

248
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:01,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I forgot, sorry.

249
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:10,685
[SPEAKER_02]: We will see what happens to the sales of Japan's DS units on April 21st when Turquoise Blue and Candy Pink roll out.

250
00:14:11,511 --> 00:14:26,202
[SPEAKER_01]: and then Barf Green you know there's people out there that want a candy pink DS just you wait for the transparent crystal DS to be coming out and then they'll have crystal pink and crystal blue and then there's baby shit yellow green look, moving on

251
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:34,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's some interesting news.

252
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:37,220
[SPEAKER_02]: You know the Four Swords that was out on GameCube?

253
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:37,900
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm sorry.

254
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,601
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about it.

255
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:39,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Zelda Four Swords?

256
00:14:39,721 --> 00:14:40,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly you've heard of this.

257
00:14:40,441 --> 00:14:41,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.

258
00:14:41,442 --> 00:14:42,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me a break.

259
00:14:42,502 --> 00:14:48,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not a lot of people really played this game because in order to do it, you had to have the link cables.

260
00:14:49,225 --> 00:14:53,826
[SPEAKER_02]: If you really wanted to get four people in on the fun, you had to have the link cables so everybody could be their own link.

261
00:14:55,067 --> 00:14:55,847
[SPEAKER_03]: We did that at my house.

262
00:14:56,467 --> 00:15:00,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay, but only the hardcore gaming nerds like yourself could really participate in this.

263
00:15:02,093 --> 00:15:02,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

264
00:15:02,774 --> 00:15:04,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Something we'll see at E3 probably.

265
00:15:04,215 --> 00:15:04,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

266
00:15:32,513 --> 00:15:38,138
[SPEAKER_02]: April Fool's was this past week and of course a lot of websites rolled out their own ha ha funny stuff.

267
00:15:38,498 --> 00:15:39,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that we would ever do this.

268
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,061
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't participate at all.

269
00:15:41,081 --> 00:15:42,582
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we don't believe in April Fool's Day.

270
00:15:42,602 --> 00:15:44,745
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't do anything on the site, nothing in LiveJournal.

271
00:15:44,765 --> 00:15:45,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely nothing.

272
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:49,890
[SPEAKER_02]: We would never make up stories about being bought or anything like that.

273
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:50,490
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd never do that.

274
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would we ever sell out anyway?

275
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:52,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

276
00:15:52,572 --> 00:15:53,233
[SPEAKER_02]: We would never sell out.

277
00:15:56,434 --> 00:15:58,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's some popular April Fools jokes you might have seen.

278
00:15:59,095 --> 00:16:00,375
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all jokes, by the way.

279
00:16:00,495 --> 00:16:02,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Epic Games announcing Unreal 3.

280
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:03,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

281
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:04,737
[SPEAKER_02]: This was funny.

282
00:16:05,017 --> 00:16:11,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Slashdot said that online support for the PlayStation 2 version of Final Fantasy XI is going to be discontinued.

283
00:16:11,599 --> 00:16:13,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to piss off the people who spent $99 on the hard drive.

284
00:16:14,821 --> 00:16:17,261
[SPEAKER_03]: That's beautiful, and actually that would be a dream come true.

285
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:22,283
[SPEAKER_02]: World of Warcraft is going to incorporate, and this was announced on World of Warcraft's site.

286
00:16:22,323 --> 00:16:24,464
[SPEAKER_02]: They are incorporating Slash Panda.

287
00:16:25,754 --> 00:16:32,355
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can get deliveries from Pandaren Express, and it comes delivered to you with a guy dressed in costume.

288
00:16:33,876 --> 00:16:39,157
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an April Fool's joke, mind you, not a reality, but the pictures were so cute, because it actually had a little panda in the game.

289
00:16:39,537 --> 00:16:40,057
[SPEAKER_02]: So cute.

290
00:16:42,717 --> 00:16:49,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, also, other stories that were going on, we had OC Remix announcing a partnership with EA.

291
00:16:50,783 --> 00:16:57,085
[SPEAKER_02]: and let's see, computer and video games announcing that Shrek 2 characters will be in the GameCube release of Soul Calibur 3.

292
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:00,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Barf.

293
00:17:00,826 --> 00:17:02,026
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be hilarious.

294
00:17:02,106 --> 00:17:03,286
[SPEAKER_03]: I play this as the dragon.

295
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:06,107
[SPEAKER_02]: What I thought was really funny is something that GameSpot did.

296
00:17:06,127 --> 00:17:16,010
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually ran an article saying that John Woo had actually bought the rights to the Katamari Damacy movie and it was going to star The Rock as the Prince of All Cosmos.

297
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,590
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

298
00:17:18,951 --> 00:17:20,252
[SPEAKER_03]: I would actually pay to see that.

299
00:17:20,312 --> 00:17:26,875
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to bestow the winner to the best April Fool's prank on GameSpot for the Katamari Damacy starring The Rock.

300
00:17:27,155 --> 00:17:37,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Other really crappy nominations would go to Alakazam for saying that Final Fantasy XI and World of Warcraft merged, which fooled no one.

301
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:38,460
[SPEAKER_01]: And...

302
00:17:42,324 --> 00:17:48,228
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Slashdot really sucked because they had a ton of, all the articles on April 1st were all fake, so that's too bad.

303
00:17:48,288 --> 00:17:51,871
[SPEAKER_03]: I still never checked GameFacts.com because they do something every year.

304
00:17:52,251 --> 00:17:56,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Like one year they did, this was a few years ago, they did Xbox Facts.

305
00:17:56,694 --> 00:17:59,676
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one I remember, that they got bought by Microsoft or something.

306
00:18:00,336 --> 00:18:08,122
[SPEAKER_02]: I think somebody was telling me all the mods banned themselves or something, but if you're not a member of the community, you may not have seen it, I don't know, so we'll see.

307
00:18:08,562 --> 00:18:13,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, Orange Lounge Radio, we're not just here to talk about video games all the time.

308
00:18:13,923 --> 00:18:19,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you live, eat, breathe, sleep video games, you're never going to get laid.

309
00:18:20,844 --> 00:18:23,985
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're here also to give you advice on how to better your life.

310
00:18:24,025 --> 00:18:31,326
[SPEAKER_02]: And who better than, I believe you could be, DarkSakura, the only podcast video game female.

311
00:18:31,526 --> 00:18:33,466
[SPEAKER_02]: I could be wrong, but you may be.

312
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:36,367
[SPEAKER_02]: So she's here to give you her little bit of advice.

313
00:18:37,466 --> 00:18:39,227
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is the advice you're going to give tonight?

314
00:18:42,628 --> 00:18:45,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Today's bit of advice is how to survive a nuclear explosion.

315
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:54,633
[SPEAKER_03]: In the event of a nuclear war or explosion, get to a safe shelter as quickly as possible and remain inside for four to six days after the last explosion.

316
00:18:57,694 --> 00:19:03,716
[SPEAKER_03]: An underground shelter covered by one meter or more of earth will provide the best protection against nuclear explosion and fallout radiation.

317
00:19:04,514 --> 00:19:09,396
[SPEAKER_03]: If you must emerge, limit your surface exposure to no more than 30 minutes a day for 13 days following the explosion.

318
00:19:10,677 --> 00:19:14,159
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have been exposed to radiation, immediately wash your body thoroughly with soap and water.

319
00:19:14,459 --> 00:19:16,760
[SPEAKER_03]: This will remove most of the radiation particles, but not all.

320
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:26,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Water can be safely obtained from underground sources , that undergo natural filtration, or from pipes in houses or stores.

321
00:19:27,062 --> 00:19:32,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Healthy looking wild animals are a safe food source if other food sources are not available.

322
00:19:32,565 --> 00:19:35,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Avoid any meat close to the bones and joints.

323
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,049
[SPEAKER_03]: An animal skeleton holds more than 90% of the radioactivity.

324
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:40,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Any last pieces of advice?

325
00:19:41,451 --> 00:19:41,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

326
00:19:42,371 --> 00:19:43,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't live in Iraq.

327
00:19:46,494 --> 00:19:46,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

328
00:19:47,901 --> 00:19:48,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

329
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:52,262
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked briefly about an April Fool's joke that involves Soul Calibur 3.

330
00:19:52,302 --> 00:19:53,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's something that's not a joke.

331
00:19:53,843 --> 00:19:56,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Some recent details being announced on Soul Calibur 3.

332
00:19:57,744 --> 00:20:03,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Interview with a games producer revealed on the official Japanese Soul Calibur 3 site.

333
00:20:03,385 --> 00:20:04,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Some official things revealed.

334
00:20:05,386 --> 00:20:10,307
[SPEAKER_02]: They will not be doing guest characters on PlayStation 2, although they have received offers.

335
00:20:11,207 --> 00:20:15,649
[SPEAKER_02]: They've received offers, but the policy is we don't do the same thing twice.

336
00:20:16,209 --> 00:20:17,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Crash Bandicoot.

337
00:20:18,072 --> 00:20:19,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Please no, please no.

338
00:20:19,575 --> 00:20:20,296
[SPEAKER_02]: God, no.

339
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,245
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the idea of having the prince of all cosmos, you know, just roll people over.

340
00:20:25,506 --> 00:20:27,209
[SPEAKER_01]: What about Sonic?

341
00:20:27,734 --> 00:20:29,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope, not gonna happen, sorry.

342
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:30,396
[SPEAKER_03]: There was already Sonic Fighters.

343
00:20:30,616 --> 00:20:38,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the other bummer, a lot of people had their hopes up about this, but it was confirmed by the game's producer, no online play.

344
00:20:38,763 --> 00:20:41,104
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go online, the PS2, who'd have thunk it?

345
00:20:42,045 --> 00:20:50,392
[SPEAKER_02]: The official reason here, at the current time, the online infrastructure is extremely different between countries, and there's people that can't enjoy network gaming.

346
00:20:50,712 --> 00:20:54,575
[SPEAKER_02]: We've decided to concentrate on improving the game's offline content,

347
00:20:54,935 --> 00:20:58,403
[SPEAKER_02]: and its characters so that people all over the world will be able to have fun.

348
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:00,446
[SPEAKER_03]: That was nice of them.

349
00:21:00,706 --> 00:21:04,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it seems like just kind of a, to me it's more of like a, you know, cheap.

350
00:21:04,948 --> 00:21:10,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we didn't want to do the online thing because we want to make offline better.

351
00:21:10,131 --> 00:21:12,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, of course we want to make offline better.

352
00:21:12,713 --> 00:21:15,435
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea is to do both really well, but whatever.

353
00:21:15,715 --> 00:21:22,499
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been holding off on doing online because we're worried about how Tekken 5 is going to beat our ass senseless.

354
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:24,200
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's all Namco.

355
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,621
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all Namco either way.

356
00:21:26,889 --> 00:21:28,330
[SPEAKER_03]: They're getting the money.

357
00:21:28,771 --> 00:21:30,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no!

358
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:31,473
[SPEAKER_02]: You just got game served.

359
00:21:35,217 --> 00:21:35,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

360
00:21:35,617 --> 00:21:36,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

361
00:21:36,158 --> 00:21:41,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Capcom doing a little bit of ego inflation this week with a press release talking about their game sales.

362
00:21:42,646 --> 00:21:46,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Talking about their series, how successful their game series are.

363
00:21:46,689 --> 00:21:47,329
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you think?

364
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:48,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Just asking.

365
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you're reading, Loki, so you can't guess.

366
00:21:50,912 --> 00:21:54,354
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you had to guess, what is Capcom's number one series of all time?

367
00:21:54,374 --> 00:21:55,615
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you guess, DarkSakura?

368
00:21:55,635 --> 00:21:56,075
[SPEAKER_01]: Street Fighter.

369
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:56,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Street Fighter.

370
00:21:57,276 --> 00:21:58,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Street Fighter is number two.

371
00:22:01,139 --> 00:22:02,700
[SPEAKER_02]: They're on the sales chart.

372
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,843
[SPEAKER_02]: 24 million cumulative units over 53 different titles.

373
00:22:07,663 --> 00:22:08,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Breath of Fire.

374
00:22:08,885 --> 00:22:15,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Breath of Fire is number 10 on the list.

375
00:22:15,606 --> 00:22:17,407
[SPEAKER_02]: 13 titles, 3 million units.

376
00:22:17,507 --> 00:22:19,147
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck else did Capcom do?

377
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Mega Man would be number 3 on the list.

378
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:28,149
[SPEAKER_02]: 95 games.

379
00:22:28,369 --> 00:22:29,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Strider!

380
00:22:29,729 --> 00:22:30,389
[SPEAKER_02]: 22.9 million units.

381
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:31,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Strider not on the list.

382
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:32,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Strider's awesome.

383
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:34,410
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you a hint.

384
00:22:35,531 --> 00:22:37,571
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a series so huge they made movies out of it.

385
00:22:39,534 --> 00:22:44,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they made Street Fighter movies too, but we don't deny the existence of that.

386
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:46,799
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't get this right, you're going to end up in a Jamie's sandwich.

387
00:22:53,945 --> 00:22:54,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Resident Evil!

388
00:22:55,446 --> 00:22:57,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Resident Evil is the number one!

389
00:22:57,467 --> 00:22:58,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you know what?

390
00:22:58,748 --> 00:23:00,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember the dialogue in the first one?

391
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:01,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Jill's sandwich!

392
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,232
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to end up in a Jill's sandwich.

393
00:23:03,692 --> 00:23:04,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up, Barry, you bitch!

394
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,643
[SPEAKER_02]: 26 million units with 38 titles.

395
00:23:08,683 --> 00:23:09,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Other titles on the list.

00:23:09,644 --> 00:23:11,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Number 4, Disney titles.

397
00:23:11,226 --> 00:23:11,847

[SPEAKER_02]: 7, Dino Crisis.

00:23:16,012 --> 00:23:16,974
[SPEAKER_02]: 8, Ghosts and Goblins.

402
00:23:17,815 --> 00:23:18,856
[SPEAKER_02]: 9, Final Fight.

403
00:23:18,876 --> 00:23:19,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Devil May Cry.

404
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:21,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I have every Final Fight game.

405
00:23:22,657 --> 00:23:24,258
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be all eight titles?

406
00:23:24,598 --> 00:23:25,239
[SPEAKER_02]: There's eight titles?

407
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:28,341
[SPEAKER_03]: I have... Okay, well you don't need to... The first three I have it on Sega CD.

408
00:23:28,501 --> 00:23:29,742
[SPEAKER_03]: I have Mighty Final Fight.

409
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:31,503
[SPEAKER_03]: I have Final Fight Guy.

410
00:23:31,923 --> 00:23:32,424
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

411
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:36,307
[SPEAKER_02]: That's... Wow, having Final Fight Guy and some of the other stuff, those were rare titles.

412
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:37,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

413
00:23:37,988 --> 00:23:38,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

414
00:23:38,368 --> 00:23:38,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

415
00:23:38,688 --> 00:23:39,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, sorry.

416
00:23:39,969 --> 00:23:40,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

417
00:23:41,329 --> 00:23:42,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Doom 3 is coming out this week.

418
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,310
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to pick it up at midnight?

419
00:23:44,731 --> 00:23:45,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Blockbuster.

420
00:23:45,651 --> 00:23:47,892
[SPEAKER_02]: They have that gaming division called Game Rush.

421
00:23:47,952 --> 00:23:49,192
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be doing a midnight sale.

422
00:23:49,552 --> 00:23:50,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Monday, April 4th.

423
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:54,414
[SPEAKER_02]: So by the time some of you guys hear this, you may already have your copy of Doom 3.

424
00:23:54,914 --> 00:23:56,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, this is the Xbox version, of course.

425
00:23:57,795 --> 00:24:04,297
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you are so lucky as to live near the Game Rush on Hillcrest Avenue in Dallas...

426
00:24:05,287 --> 00:24:10,592
[SPEAKER_02]: There will actually be some folks from ID Software there in person to give autographs because I guess they're famous.

427
00:24:11,673 --> 00:24:12,854
[SPEAKER_03]: But not as famous as we are.

428
00:24:13,134 --> 00:24:14,135
[SPEAKER_03]: We're internet celebrities.

429
00:24:14,355 --> 00:24:15,136
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I heard?

430
00:24:15,356 --> 00:24:15,536
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

431
00:24:15,777 --> 00:24:17,338
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is not an April Fool's joke.

432
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:20,581
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about games coming out and stuff.

433
00:24:21,542 --> 00:24:22,102
[SPEAKER_01]: Take two.

434
00:24:22,823 --> 00:24:25,626
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the rights now to Duke Nukem Forever.

435
00:24:25,846 --> 00:24:26,907
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supposed to be coming out.

436
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:31,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that would be something else to finally see that damn game.

437
00:24:31,472 --> 00:24:35,473
[SPEAKER_01]: And Take-Two, I mean, I imagine they'd be able to be on top of that stuff.

438
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:40,135
[SPEAKER_01]: We might actually see this before the turn of the next millennia.

439
00:24:40,435 --> 00:24:41,515
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see, we'll see.

440
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:44,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, couple quick stories to finish out on Squeenix.

441
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,837
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't talked a whole lot about Squeenix tonight, of course.

442
00:24:47,217 --> 00:24:49,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Squenix, or Squareenix, whatever you want to say.

443
00:24:49,517 --> 00:24:50,758
[SPEAKER_02]: We like to call him Squeenix.

444
00:24:50,818 --> 00:24:51,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Squeenix!

445
00:24:53,004 --> 00:24:55,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Squeenix is doing a brand new role-playing game.

446
00:24:56,945 --> 00:25:06,408
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Code Age Commanders is the name of this, and it's going to be an action role-playing game set on a futuristic, post-apocalyptic planet.

447
00:25:06,788 --> 00:25:08,569
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that word, post-apocalyptic.

448
00:25:09,489 --> 00:25:10,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Aren't they all?

449
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Squeenix doing an RPG?

450
00:25:12,151 --> 00:25:12,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Who would have thought?

451
00:25:13,432 --> 00:25:13,912
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

452
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:22,738
[SPEAKER_02]: A game is being produced by Naora Yusuki, who worked as an artist for many of Squeenix's games, including Final Fantasy X and Unlimited Saga.

453
00:25:23,118 --> 00:25:26,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very good Squeenix game and a very, very shitty Squeenix game.

454
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,381
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate the Saga series.

455
00:25:28,262 --> 00:25:28,962
[SPEAKER_02]: It's no secret.

456
00:25:29,042 --> 00:25:30,383
[SPEAKER_03]: A bunch of people really like them.

457
00:25:30,683 --> 00:25:31,144
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate it.

458
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:32,906
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't they... Screw other people!

459
00:25:33,046 --> 00:25:39,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't they, I don't know, direct their attention to, maybe, say, Einhänder 2?

460
00:25:39,673 --> 00:25:40,974
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we need Dew Prism 2.

461
00:25:41,795 --> 00:25:42,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Screw that.

462
00:25:42,275 --> 00:25:44,618
[SPEAKER_02]: How about getting Final Fantasy 12 out in a timely manner?

463
00:25:45,612 --> 00:25:47,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Just some suggestions if any folks from Squeenix are listening.

464
00:25:51,435 --> 00:25:51,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

465
00:25:52,096 --> 00:25:58,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, by the way, Code H Commander, 50% complete, slated for release this year sometime in Japan.

466
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Real quick note before we get into our last story tonight.

467
00:26:01,501 --> 00:26:06,884
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have any feedback for us, you can reach us via email to go at orangeloungeradio.com.

468
00:26:07,164 --> 00:26:09,045
[SPEAKER_02]: And we haven't done a mailbag section in a little while.

469
00:26:09,065 --> 00:26:13,668
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't really gotten any letters that you folks want read on air, any questions that we can respond to.

470
00:26:13,748 --> 00:26:13,848
[SPEAKER_02]: So,

471
00:26:14,308 --> 00:26:15,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely would like to see some of those.

472
00:26:15,469 --> 00:26:16,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Togo, all one word, T-O-G-O.

473
00:26:16,929 --> 00:26:19,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Why shouldn't they want their questions answered by us?

474
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:20,251
[SPEAKER_03]: We're famous.

475
00:26:22,492 --> 00:26:24,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the reminder, I forgot.

476
00:26:24,673 --> 00:26:26,433
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't let you forget, we are famous.

477
00:26:26,514 --> 00:26:30,455
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a social responsibility as internet superstars.

478
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:33,176
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just community service, this program here, really.

479
00:26:33,196 --> 00:26:35,217
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, mentioning Togo makes me want a sandwich.

480
00:26:36,218 --> 00:26:36,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Togo!

481
00:26:36,878 --> 00:26:37,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Not Togo, it's Togo.

482
00:26:37,878 --> 00:26:38,839
[SPEAKER_03]: I think of Sana.

483
00:26:40,795 --> 00:26:41,855
[SPEAKER_02]: You want a Sana Witch?

484
00:26:43,917 --> 00:26:55,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Lastly, speaking of Konami, because we're talking about some of their artists there with Togo and Sana from the Beatmania series and various other Bomani series, Konami is going to be releasing mobile games in China.

485
00:26:57,967 --> 00:26:59,008
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is the interesting thing.

486
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:04,072
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be releasing 30 games annually, they say, starting with

487
00:27:04,968 --> 00:27:09,691
[SPEAKER_02]: 3 classic 1980s titles at 2 yuan per download.

488
00:27:09,851 --> 00:27:13,334
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, that equivalents to 24 cents.

489
00:27:14,294 --> 00:27:14,654
[SPEAKER_02]: 24 cents!

490
00:27:15,055 --> 00:27:18,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Contra, Antarctic Adventure, and Life Force.

491
00:27:18,925 --> 00:27:20,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, Life Force Encontra!

492
00:27:20,426 --> 00:27:22,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't we get anything this cool in the US?

493
00:27:22,327 --> 00:27:23,027
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want to know.

494
00:27:23,067 --> 00:27:25,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Because cell phone technology is like a million years better in Asia.

495
00:27:26,009 --> 00:27:31,512
[SPEAKER_02]: I just spent $5 on a brand new download that Sprint had, because Sprint's my cell phone company.

496
00:27:31,552 --> 00:27:34,814
[SPEAKER_02]: They have downloads for games too, and they sometimes have retro titles in there.

497
00:27:34,874 --> 00:27:37,455
[SPEAKER_03]: I deleted the games off of my cell phone because they sucked ass.

498
00:27:37,475 --> 00:27:39,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I downloaded Impossible Mission.

499
00:27:40,037 --> 00:27:40,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knew?

500
00:27:40,497 --> 00:27:42,378
[SPEAKER_02]: They ported Impossible Mission to cell phones.

501
00:27:42,418 --> 00:27:44,439
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh my gosh, that's the coolest thing ever.

502
00:27:44,459 --> 00:27:46,220
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like the best Commodore 64 game.

503
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:46,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

504
00:27:47,061 --> 00:27:47,761
[SPEAKER_02]: On the cell phone.

505
00:27:48,394 --> 00:27:48,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Sucks.

506
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:49,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Balls.

507
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, waste of money.

508
00:27:52,936 --> 00:27:56,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so people can die of, you know, what do people die of in that game?

509
00:27:56,737 --> 00:27:57,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Die of death.

510
00:27:57,277 --> 00:28:00,798
[SPEAKER_02]: You caught diphtheria.

511
00:28:00,818 --> 00:28:01,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Diphtheria, thank you.

512
00:28:01,898 --> 00:28:03,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, trying to remember why people die, yes.

513
00:28:04,459 --> 00:28:06,140
[SPEAKER_01]: Wolves ate you.

514
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:15,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you seen the commercial for Jamster where they're selling the, what was it, it was Rainbow Six for the cell phone?

515
00:28:16,516 --> 00:28:16,856
[SPEAKER_01]: Crap.

516
00:28:17,056 --> 00:28:19,757
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't pay attention to Jamster commercials because they're the devil.

517
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,100
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

518
00:28:57,549 --> 00:29:01,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Will somebody just bring the cool shit over here from the other companies?

519
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:04,971
[SPEAKER_02]: I will sign up with you guys so quick if I can get light force on my phone.

520
00:29:04,991 --> 00:29:10,552
[SPEAKER_03]: If I find out that if I go to Japan and buy a Kei Tai and it freaking works in the States, if my sim will work on it.

521
00:29:10,592 --> 00:29:11,373
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it will.

522
00:29:11,873 --> 00:29:15,254
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still wanting to get one because you can get cell phones dirt cheap.

523
00:29:17,054 --> 00:29:19,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's going to do it for this edition of the podcast.

524
00:29:19,895 --> 00:29:23,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go around and see what everybody's final thoughts are.

525
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:23,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting off with Loki.

526
00:29:24,838 --> 00:29:28,800
[SPEAKER_01]: My final thought is I hope I get paid soon because I need more games.

527
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,641
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is DS, good game.

528
00:29:33,081 --> 00:29:33,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Now.

529
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:35,422
