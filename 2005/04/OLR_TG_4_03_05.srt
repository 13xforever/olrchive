12
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,360
news going on in the world and of course tons of PSP stuff because you know this

13
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,880
PSP has been this gigantic, like, Katamari Damacy ball just rolling down a hill.

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,120
It's what's popular this week. It's the big thing, so we'll talk about some PSP

15
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,520
news, but first, what's going on in your gaming world? Dark Sakura. I've been

16
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,320
playing a lot of the games on the Gorillaz.com site, like Widescreen Pong

17
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:20,720
and HeliDrop. It's been pretty fun. So no, like, consoles or anything? I looked at

18
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:28,200
Final Fantasy 11 I didn't actually play it though. You looked at it, you just checked it out. I moved my play online icon. I've been too

19
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,680
busy I've been doing other stuff and of course being a famous internet

20
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,400
celebrity. Did you move it to the recycle bin or where did you move the icon?

21
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,400
Elsewhere. Oh okay so that's it not a lot of gaming? I can't be bothered with that kind of

22
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,480
thing anymore I'm a famous internet celebrity. I forgot I'm so sorry and

23
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,080
that's it so this is just the I'm busy being famous all right all right

24
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:58,800
Loki I bought a PSP sucker no that's cool sucker I if I could afford it I'd

25
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,560
buy one too I'm with the trends no no I got a PSP and I got two games I got the

26
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:09,840
wipeout pure just because I like the hack yes you bought wipeout pure it has

27
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,640
nothing to do with the fact that you like wipeout because I think I think I

28
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,600
distinctly remember you saying you were disappointed with the wipeout series I

29
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,400
I hated Wipeout, actually.

30
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,100
But you just wanted to buy it because you know it's the game that allows people to hack their PSPs, so...

31
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,600
Yup.

32
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,500
Yeah, that's what I thought.

33
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,100
But I like Wipeout now, because I've been playing it. It's actually pretty fun.

34
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:33,900
I don't know. I tried Wipeout 3 a while back, and I tried Wipeout XL. I just didn't get into it.

35
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,400
Um...

36
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,000
Nah, you know what? I need to bring over my pair of Negcons.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,200
I need to play Wipeout with a Negcon.

38
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,300
Uh... what is that?

39
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,800
It's a Namco controller.

40
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,600
Oh...

41
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,400
The twisty one.

42
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,900
Okay, okay. And then the one with the little dial is the Jog Con. I've seen those. I have a Jog Con that's completely useless. I have like three Jog Cons.

43
00:02:52,900 --> 00:03:05,400
Um, anyway. Anyways. So yeah, I got Wipeout Pure and I got Twisted Metal Face On, or Head On, I think. And I like, I love Twisted Metal. I mean, Twisted Metal Head On, though, is exactly like Twisted Metal 2, that's all it is.

44
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,400
But, hey, if you're gonna make a remake of one of the original games, Twisted Metal 2 would be the one to do it, because that was, like, one of the best.

45
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,240
Why didn't you get luminous because they weren't selling luminous and I can only afford two games

46
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:22,340
So, you know those were the two it was either that or you know, I get like some stupid NFL game or something

47
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:28,080
It's like no. Thank you. I will take twisted metal black or not black head-on and

48
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,840
The white belt pier

49
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,680
but um, so I've been playing those they're fun and I

50
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,200
Do not like

51
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,920
the analog controller on the PSP

52
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,640
it's just not working for me. I think it's cute. I think it could differ, I love it. I think it's cute. It's actually pretty easy.

53
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,800
I don't know it's just it I guess I gotta get used to it but I've been using the

54
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,960
digital stuff for now

55
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,680
and it works just fine for me. Whatever I mean.

56
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,680
I'll need to bring over Darkstalkers.

57
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,240
I'm not a huge fan of Darkstalkers. But it's really neat on the PSP.

58
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,440
I'll take your word for it. I don't know I'm

59
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,020
I'm just like... The other reason I got one though, work related, because my boss just

60
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:17,700
got one and I figured it'd be kinda cool to just play against him during a break or something

61
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,420
or just to be able to actually play some of the games. Also, I want to drag it with me

62
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,900
to E3 because you know they're going to have WiFi hotspots there and you know there's going

63
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:29,300
to be PSP crap there. So, might as well drag my portable systems with me.

64
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,100
Brown nosing with a PSP. Very nice.

65
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:32,700
Exactly.

66
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:38,080
Alright, great. As far as what's going on in my gaming world, I was, you know, obviously,

67
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,000
since Loki's my roommate, I was checking out his PSP a little bit, so I played a little

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,520
bit of Wipeout as well. I suck at Wipeout, though, so forget it. But I kinda want a PSP,

69
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,580
but I'm gonna wait for some later games. I really, really want Luminous, but it's not

70
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:54,000
enough for me to justify spending so much money on a system at this point. Maybe later.

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,640
The one I want is actually, they have that cool one with the, where you disable bombs.

72
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,800
That looked kinda neat.

73
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,340
I don't remember the name of that one offhand, but, hmm.

74
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,580
Oh well.

75
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,080
Anyway, so I'll get a PSP eventually, but it's very pretty, I was watching Spider-Man,

76
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,080
like, even though I've already seen Spider-Man 2, like, twice, and didn't really want to watch it again,

77
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,840
I just wanted to see what video looked like on there, I was quite impressed.

78
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,680
I have to admit, it's pretty nice looking.

79
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,080
You can also, though, download video from your computer.

80
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,120
And actually-

81
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,320
I was telling Loki he needs to put some pornography on there, but-

82
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,960
GameStop's gonna be carrying the 1GB cards coming up soon.

83
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,960
Now, in order to download that stuff, I gotta buy an additional piece of crap that's gotta go with it.

84
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,460
Alright.

85
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:31,960
Buy the cable.

86
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,960
Then I can just bring our cable over and you can borrow it.

87
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,460
I need to get me, um, a 1 gig stick.

88
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,460
Actually, I'm not even gonna...

89
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,960
Cuz I don't know how much those 1 gig sticks are, what, they're like 200 some dollars or something?

90
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,460
Yikes!

91
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,960
Not necessarily. I think Best Buy was having them for about 130 something.

92
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,960
That's still scary!

93
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:54,920
Fuck that, cause you know what, you can actually go out there and buy, there's a USB to Mini-B,

94
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:00,440
which is the like USB thing that's on top of the PSP adapter for $13, and then hook

95
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,120
up your wonderful flash drives, guess what, my flash drive is like, you know, 128 megs

96
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,820
right there, and what, I bought that for 20 bucks?

97
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,400
Fuck that, why the hell would I go spend, you know, tons of money to buy this, you know,

98
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,400
proprietary crap?

99
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,880
It's a good idea in theory, I just hope it works.

100
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,880
I hope it works.

101
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,460
But, you know, I'm just interested.

102
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:23,720
I've been like jumping on the Wi-Fi spots, you know people that are neighbors and stuff that have internet

103
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,700
And then they put wireless routers without passwords on them. Hey, this is my gaming week. Sorry. That's right

104
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,900
So I instead I picked up a new DS game

105
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,660
I was like, you know, I didn't want to spend $300 on a PSP

106
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,140
But I had to spend money like you know

107
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,940
That money was burning a hole in my pocket because I just did my taxes and I'm getting money back and all that

108
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,580
So I instead decided to go out and buy a new game for the DS

109
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,740
The unfortunate thing is that the DS really doesn't have a whole lot of games on it, and

110
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:53,580
so, you know, I already have Mario 64 and I already have WarioWare Touch, so what does

111
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,580
that leave?

112
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,580
Not a whole lot.

113
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,700
I already have Feel the Magic, so it was pretty much, it came down between Sprung and this

114
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:04,540
other title, Yoshi Touch and Go, so I picked up Yoshi Touch and Go.

115
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,100
Not impressed.

116
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,100
Not impressed.

117
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,720
It's just very repetitive to me, and it's very frustrating.

118
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,240
The difficulty bar is set very high, it's something that in some reviews out there on

119
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,760
the internet they were calling this a kids game.

120
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,960
Oh my gosh, I guess kids are smarter than I am because I'm getting so frustrated with

121
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,800
this game trying to beat some of the records you have to beat to unlock new stages.

122
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,220
So I'm pretty much getting sick of this.

123
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,640
So as soon as something better catches my eye, this thing's going, getting sold back

124
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,640
or something.

125
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,160
I just was not impressed with Yoshi Touch and Go.

126
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,280
So Touch and Buy as far as I'm concerned.

127
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,760
Let's get into some gaming news.

128
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,600
found some fun little customizable things ones for the Xbox and ones for

129
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,640
the PSP what'd you find Loki for the Xbox well if you happen to love Hello

130
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:54,840
Kitty like we all do okay no we all don't but you know what a way to ruin a

131
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,960
perfectly good crystal you know Xbox case by shoving some stupid Hello Kitty

132
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:05,440
crap on it for Hello Kitty mission rescue the special edition crystal

133
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,760
console that you can get it's basically wait wait I just want clever this isn't

134
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,280
like a giant sticker you put on your existing crystal console, which you can't even get

135
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,800
in this country anyway. But it's a brand new Xbox that they're selling that is specifically

136
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,160
Hello Kitty Mission Rescue.

137
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,080
Yup, with this crappy crystal console. It's a crystal console, which is like really awesome,

138
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:32,080
but... I don't know. Anyways, so, before they had a pink Xbox, why would you buy an Xbox?

139
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,360
Yeah, because you know, I've been really waiting for the Hello Kitty game to come out for me

140
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,960
to buy an Xbox. That's been the game that will do it for me. But anyways, so they have

141
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:49,240
this Hello Kitty Crystal Xbox console that you can get. It comes with a crystal controller,

142
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:56,120
which hopefully doesn't have this pink crap on it, and the Mission Rescue game for $99

143
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:02,160
with the purchase of a selected Samsung LCD TV, and you can only get it in Singapore on

144
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:08,760
eBay where people would be selling it from Singapore so there's that then if

145
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:14,800
you are the wonderful celebrity they've been doing Simmons jeweler company made

146
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,720
some accessories for the Sony PSP they debuted this at the March 14th or at

147
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,560
March 14th at the Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood dubbed the print that

148
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,480
print a PSP whatever that's supposed to mean and it says that brought together

149
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:38,200
There's some of the hottest names in fashion other well-known designers including Marc Jacobs and will it wait wait

150
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,800
This was a fashion show for PSP's and I correct here. Ah, yes, I believe you're correct

151
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,400
It's now this isn't

152
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,340
It's the top models including Maggie Riser

153
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,200
Kirstie Hume and people we don't care about come on

154
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,880
No gamer cares about the people.

155
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,400
Anyways, so showed off the newest trend in fashion by wearing the sexy, sleek PSP accessories

156
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,720
with the latest looks and fall.

157
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,640
What I love about this is that it's bling for your PSP is really what it is.

158
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,640
It's bling bling.

159
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,640
Like, look at this.

160
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,180
You've got this gold PSP and there's a whole nother joke that can be made there about the

161
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,600
golden PSP if anybody watches South Park.

162
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:20,020
But you can get the gold PSP and you get these bling, bling chains that hang from it.

163
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,020
It's tacky.

164
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:25,820
And you want to know what the gemstones on their cell phones and shit.

165
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,980
And you want to know how much this costs, folks?

166
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,020
Oh god.

167
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,740
Because this isn't going to be for the average user, I don't know why you'd want to buy one

168
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:37,180
in the first place unless you're like some overpaid rapper with no taste.

169
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,820
It would be $35,000.

170
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,820
Whoo!

171
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:45,660
$35,000 to make your PSP look like crap?

172
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:50,060
okay if I wanted to make the PSP look like crap I could go to like the craft

173
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:57,660
store and buy you know sculpty plastic and says it says a list celebrities and

174
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:04,020
showed up to this and this is a list yeah very moderately a list celebrities

175
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:09,380
Hillary Duff Haley Duff is Haley Duff even popular Haley who is Haley Duff I

176
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,380
I imagine Hilary Dove's sister maybe?

177
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,380
Or lover or something.

178
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,380
Nicole Ritchie and fiancé DJ AM and...

179
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,280
Nicole Ritchie, who you book when he can't get Paris Hilton.

180
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,500
And Michael Vartan, whoever he is.

181
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,500
And apparently I guess...

182
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,500
He's on Alias.

183
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,500
Oh.

184
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,500
I don't know how I know that, I just do.

185
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,500
Sorry guys.

186
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,500
Okay.

187
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,380
And I don't know who bought this, but I know that David Arquette was there and I know he's

188
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,340
a big gamer, so he might have bought this.

189
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,340
I don't know.

190
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,340
You know what though?

191
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:38,580
He was one that bought one of those pimped out DS's, I remember that, so...

192
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,580
Who knows?

193
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,580
More power to them.

194
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,700
Pimp my game system.

195
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,700
In other news...

196
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,400
Yeah, let's hear some DS news.

197
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,860
Another news in the DS, the other portable game world events, saying this is going to

198
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,860
happen.

199
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,300
It says Pass Me, which for those who don't know, it's this device that's actually made

200
00:11:54,300 --> 00:12:00,020
to be able to port your own code using the Game Boy code thingy.

201
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,620
And what websites is this all being documented on?

202
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,140
On dslinux.org.

203
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,740
That's right, they ported Linux to the DS.

204
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,900
The first alpha for it should be coming out in about a month, they say.

205
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,900
It's only a matter of time.

206
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,900
Oh, why, why, why?

207
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,900
And of course...

208
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,220
If it's got a computer chip in it, Linux can be installed on it.

209
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,460
As you could probably guess, Linux is already being...

210
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:25,300
They're already attempting to port Linux to the PSP, so...

211
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,300
Of course.

212
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,300
Yay.

213
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,620
I'm personally porting Linux to my toaster oven.

214
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:34,980
Honestly, if Linux is so popular, why is it not outselling Windows?

215
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:42,980
In other DS news, you know they did the new color DS's in Japan, they have graphite black

216
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:47,540
and pure white, and I know we sit here and sometimes joke like, haha Nintendo, you know

217
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:51,560
they just re-release the system in new colors to try and drive up sales, but what kind of

218
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,780
idiots actually buy the system all over again just for a new color?

219
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:58,740
Well let me put this in a little bit of perspective for you guys.

220
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:04,740
Sales for the week of March 21st to the March 27th when these new colors debuted, 54,000

221
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,900
in Japan the previous week was only 21,000 more than double the sales just

222
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:14,900
by rolling out two new colors hmm you know and this kind of matches with that

223
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:19,020
bling PSP story that there are people out there that will buy the gaming

224
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,700
system to match their purse you know what's sad is people don't realize that

225
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:27,240
you can actually go and find the mods yourself and do this for like a lot

226
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,220
cheaper than buying a brand new system or paying $35,000 we'll see what happens

227
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:38,300
Yeah, for $35,000, I can make an all-in-one gaming unit with its own built-in, like, keg

228
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,060
or something, you know?

229
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,360
Why pay $35?

230
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,660
I would pay for that.

231
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,860
I mean, why pay $35,000 for, like, a golden PSP?

232
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,220
A gaming system with a keg.

233
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:54,560
Which as soon as you drop it, will be $35,000 wasted.

234
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,740
A gaming system with a keg?

235
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,220
One day we'll be famous and spending that kind of money on games.

236
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,220
I'm already famous.

237
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,820
I oh I forgot sorry we will see what happens to the sales

238
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:09,940
of Japan's DS units on April 21st when turquoise blue and candy pink

239
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:13,100
roll out. And then barf green

240
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,420
you know there's people out there the one at candy pink DS

241
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,620
just you wait for the transparent

242
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:24,500
crystal DS to be coming out and then they'll have crystal pink and crystal blue

243
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:29,300
exactly alright alright anyway. And then there's baby shit yellow green

244
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,300
Look moving on

245
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:37,140
Here's some interesting news, you know the four swords that was out on GameCube

246
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,780
Zelda four swords certainly for to this. Come on. Give me a break. Well, not a lot of people

247
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,220
Not a lot of people really played this game because you in order to do it

248
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,300
You had to have the link cables if you really wanted to get four people in on the fun

249
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,780
You had to have the link cable. So everybody could be their own link

250
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:59,700
yeah okay but only the hardcore gaming nerds like yourself could really

251
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:04,740
participate in this okay so what now they're gonna make this game a little

252
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:10,380
more accessible by rolling it out on the DS so because the DS is wireless they're

253
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:16,180
gonna be doing this so according this is according to retail sources now Nintendo

254
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:21,640
has announced this in Japan no release dates nothing yet but I logically I

255
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,600
I would say if this game comes out in Japan, it's only a matter of time before it's out

256
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,360
in the U.S. Probably something we'll see by year's end. Who knows?

257
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,360
Something we'll see in 83, probably. Who knows?

258
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:37,560
April Fools was this past week, and of course a lot of websites rolled out their own haha

259
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,920
funny stuff. Not that we would ever do this. We didn't participate at all.

260
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,140
No, we don't believe in April Fools Day. We didn't do anything on the site, nothing

261
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,760
in LiveJournal. Absolutely nothing. We would never, you know,

262
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,880
make up stories about being bought or anything like that. We'd never do that. We're bigger

263
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:57,480
we ever sell out yeah exactly we would never sell out here's some popular April

264
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,920
Fool's jokes you might have seen these are all jokes by the way epic games

265
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:07,320
announcing unreal 3 sorry this was funny a slash dot said that online support for

266
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,720
the PlayStation 2 version of Final Fantasy 11 is gonna be discontinued just

267
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,080
to piss off the people who spent $99 that's beautiful and actually that

268
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,000
would be a dream come true world of Warcraft is going to incorporate and

269
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,780
And this was announced on World of Warcraft site, they are incorporating slash panda,

270
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:31,600
so you can get deliveries from Pandaren Express, and it comes delivered to you with a guy dressed

271
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,960
in costume.

272
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,440
This is an April Fools joke mind you, not a reality, but the pictures were so cute because

273
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,820
it actually had a little panda in the game, so cute.

274
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:48,980
Let's see, also other stories that were going on, we had OC Remix announcing a partnership

275
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:54,940
with EA, and uh, let's see, Computer and Video Games announcing that Shrek 2 characters will

276
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,180
be in the GameCube release of Soulcalibur 3.

277
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,180
Hahahaha.

278
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,180
Barf.

279
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,780
That would be hilarious.

280
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,780
But this was a really...

281
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,780
I play this the dragon.

282
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:07,240
What I thought was really funny is something that GameSpot did, they actually ran an article

283
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,740
saying that John Woo had actually bought the rights to the Katamari Damacy movie, and it

284
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,980
was gonna star The Rock as the prince of all cosmos.

285
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,820
That's great.

286
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,340
I would actually pay to see that.

287
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:25,280
So I'm going to bestow the winner to the best April Fools prank on GameSpot for the Katamari

288
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,300
Damacy starring The Rock.

289
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:35,500
Other really crappy nominations would go to Alakazam for saying that Final Fantasy XI

290
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,900
and World of Warcraft merged, which fooled no one.

291
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,940
And um, yeah.

292
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:46,740
Slashdot really sucked because they had a ton of, all the articles on April 1st were

293
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,740
all fake, so.

294
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,740
That's too bad.

295
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,820
checked game facts.com because they do something every year like one year they

296
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:58,000
did this is a few years ago they did Xbox that's the one I remember that they

297
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,340
got bought by Microsoft or something I don't I think somebody was telling me

298
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:05,400
all the mods got but all the mods banned themselves or something but if you're

299
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,960
not a member of the community you may not have seen it I don't know so we'll

300
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:13,240
see anyway um orange launch radio we're not just here to talk about video games

301
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:18,360
all the time because if you live eat breathe sleep video games you're never

302
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,960
to get out of the damn house. You're never going to get laid. No. So we're here also

303
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:27,560
to give you advice on how to better your life. And who better than I believe you could be

304
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:33,980
Daruk Sakura, the only podcast video game female. I could be wrong, but you may be.

305
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,660
So she's here to give you her little bit of advice. So what is the advice you're going

306
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:47,360
to give tonight? Today's bit of advice is how to survive a nuclear explosion. In the

307
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:55,360
In the event of a nuclear war or explosion, get to a safe shelter as quickly as possible and remain inside for four to six days after the last explosion.

308
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:04,360
An underground shelter covered by one meter or more of earth will provide the best protection against nuclear explosion and fallout radiation.

309
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:10,360
If you must submerge, limit your surface exposure to no more than 30 minutes a day for 13 days following the explosion.

310
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,360
If you have been exposed to radiation immediately, wash your body thoroughly with soap and water.

311
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,360
This will remove most of the radiation particles, but not all.

312
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,360
Water can be safely obtained from underground sources, springs and wells for example,

313
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:27,360
that undergo natural filtration, or from pipes in houses or stores.

314
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,360
Healthy looking wild animals are a safe food source if other food sources are not available.

315
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,360
Avoid any meat close to the bones and joints.

316
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,360
An animal skeleton holds more than 90% of the radioactivity.

317
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,360
Any last pieces of advice?

318
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,360
Yeah, don't live in Iraq!

319
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,360
Alright, moving on.

320
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,360
We talked briefly about an April Fool's joke that involves Soul Calibur 3.

321
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:57,360
Well, here's something that's not a joke. Some recent details being announced on Soul Calibur 3.

322
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:05,360
Interview with the game's producer revealed on the official Japanese Soul Calibur 3 site, some official things revealed.

323
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,660
They will not be doing guest characters on PlayStation 2, although they have received offers.

324
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:16,160
As soon as they've received offers, but the policy is, we don't do the same thing twice.

325
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,960
Crash Bandicoot?

326
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,560
Please no, please no.

327
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,060
God no.

328
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:25,460
I like the idea of having the prince of all cosmos, you know, just roll people over.

329
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,660
What about Sonic?

330
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,060
Nope, not gonna happen, sorry.

331
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,560
There's already Sonic fighters.

332
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,480
Here's the other bummer, a lot of people had their hopes up about this but it was

333
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,080
confirmed by the games producer

334
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,560
no online play. You can go online, the PS2?

335
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:44,640
Who'd have thunk it? The official reason here, at the current time the online

336
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,840
infrastructure is extremely different between countries

337
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,000
and there's people that can't enjoy network gaming. We've decided to

338
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,960
concentrate on improving the game's offline content and its characters

339
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,440
so that people all over the world will be able to have fun.

340
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,040
that was nice of them that well that seems like just kind of a to me it's

341
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,540
more of like a you know

342
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,640
cheap well

343
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:10,320
we didn't want to do the online thing cuz we want to make offline better one

344
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,060
course well i want to make offline better we've been idea is to do both

345
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,760
really well but whatever

346
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,940
we've been holding off on doing online because we're worried about how tech in

347
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:23,020
five is going to beat our ass senseless i

348
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,640
i don't know it's all namco

349
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,920
it's all namco either way

350
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,920
They're getting the money.

351
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,920
Who burned?

352
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,920
Got you.

353
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,920
Oh no.

354
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:35,320
You just got game served.

355
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,320
Let's see.

356
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,320
Moving on.

357
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,240
Capcom, doing a little bit of ego inflation this week with a press release, talking about

358
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:46,740
their game sales, talking about their series, how successful their game series are.

359
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,920
What would you think?

360
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,920
Just asking.

361
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,720
Now, you're reading, Loki, so you can't guess, but if you had to guess, what is Capcom's

362
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,400
number one series of all time?

363
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,400
What would you guess?

364
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,400
Dark Sakura.

365
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:03,240
Street Fighter, Street Fighter is number two with, they're on the sales chart, 24 million

366
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,720
cumulative units over 53 different titles.

367
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,960
Breath of Fire?

368
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:16,840
Breath of Fire is number, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, number 10 on the list, 13 titles, 3

369
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,840
million units.

370
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,560
Oh, what the fuck else did Capcom do?

371
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:30,060
Um, Mega Man. Mega Man would be number three on the list. 95 games. Strider! 22.9 million

372
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:36,040
units. Strider not on the list. Strider is awesome. I'll give you a hint. It was a series

373
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:41,440
so huge they made movies out of it. Oh, they made Street Fighter movies too, but we don't

374
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,340
deny the existence of that. If you don't get this right, you're going to end up in a Jamie

Planet. I love that word. Post-apocalyptic. Aren't they all?

404
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:14,160
Squeenix doing an RPG? Who would have thought? Seriously.

405
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,720
Game is being produced by Naora Yusuke,

406
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,600
who worked as an artist for many of Squeenix's games, including Final Fantasy X

407
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,840
and Unlimited Saga.

408
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,680
Very, very good Squeenix game and a very, very shitty Squeenix game. I hate the

409
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,560
Saga series.

410
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:31,240
It's no secret. A bunch of people really like them. I hate it.

411
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,920
Why don't they- Screw other people! Why don't they, I don't know, direct

412
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:42,340
their attention to maybe I'll say Einhänder 2? No, we need Do Prism 2. Screw that, how

447
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:30,060

00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:34,620
worms and it doesn't play well it has only one level no customization it's

449
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:39,140
crap cell phone games are crap that's why seriously could also games in

450
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:45,220
in America are crap. Yeah, seriously, what do we get, cage? Ooh, I'd rather play life

451
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:49,100
force. In Japan they have freakin' Gradius on the damn cell phone. Seriously, with all

452
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,380
this cell phone competition going on in the United States right now, too, you know, everybody's

453
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:56,580
buying each other out, Sprint, Nextel, Singular, ATT, all this competition that T-Mobile's

454
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:01,580

I will buy, I will sign up with you guys so quick if I could get life force on my phone.

456
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:10,380
If I go to Japan and buy a Keitai and it freaking works in the States, if my sim will work on

457
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,380
it...

458
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,380
I don't think it will, but...

459
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:15,820
I'm still wanting to get one, because you can get cell phones dirt cheap.

460
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:20,820
Alright, that's going to do it for this edition of the podcast, let's go around and see what

461
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:24,820
everybody's final thoughts are, starting off with Loki.

462
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:30,260
My final thought is, I hope I get paid soon because I need more games.

463
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,020
My final thought is, D.S.

464
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,020
Good game.

465
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,020
