284324	285904	Yay, I'm regular?
286765	287005	Yeah.
287585	287885	Anyway.
290047	290387	I don't know.
290407	291707	That's a personal question, honey.
291767	292508	I can't answer that.
292888	293528	Shut up.
294789	296450	I'm sure she keeps up with plenty of fiber.
297020	301601	Also joining us tonight, we have another special guest who just walked into the studio here.
302381	310663	Say hello to our resident... I don't know, he's our resident... We need a title for him, I don't know.
311223	311803	Pepsi Bringer.
312223	313083	Okay, Pepsi Bringer.
313163	320605	And he's a staff member over on the DDR Freak and a well-known community member, long-time player.
320645	321445	Say hello to Islander.
321665	321985	Hello.
322005	322105	Hello.
322708	323329	How you doing, sir?
323549	324590	I'm doing just fine, yourself?
324850	325150	Good!
325791	335238	I am a little sad, though, because as you have heard, the rumors are true, tonight is the last episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
336599	337340	From this studio.
338000	343005	So... I was about to say, all the more reason I'm here, but alright.
343605	346988	So, yeah, we are starting over.
349069	349530	Actually...
350359	362085	This is, yeah, actually that's kind of the theme of tonight, is we are starting over, because we're saying goodbye to this studio that served us well for the past two years of the show, and we're going to be moving into a new studio in two weeks.
362345	364887	We're actually not going to be here next week, we'll talk about that a little more in a little bit.
366768	371430	But this place right now is, I would say it's empty, but it's really not.
371490	375252	It looks like the remnants of a tsunami in this place, to be honest.
375472	376673	I don't know how else to explain it.
376733	377013	Loki...
379102	381864	It looks like any house that you would see on Cops.
383585	384725	That's a good way of putting it.
385306	386366	With wires everywhere.
386947	389168	And a hidden stash of heroin in Loki's room.
391429	394751	My room literally has a pile of crap on top of the bed.
394831	400795	It's just like this giant pile of clothes and records and God, who knows what.
401095	407399	I instantly was, I knew better because I've actually known someone who has a pile of real crap on his bed from his cat.
409389	410269	It was very gross.
411010	412470	It's a friend of mine's ex-boyfriend.
414011	421854	Anyway, so our webcam tonight, unfortunately, because of the move going on, we're actually missing... The arcade cabinet is no longer here in the studio.
421954	423955	The couch is no longer here in the studio.
424235	426096	We tried to hook up the Shamu cam.
426556	427657	It was the coffee table.
427857	431238	So we're... There's no computer to run a webcam.
431378	433559	I think the PlayStation 2 is not even here anymore.
433599	436681	No, the computer is in the...
437870	439411	The kitchen, for some reason.
442272	443933	It's toasting something, apparently.
444013	444493	I don't know.
444994	447315	My other computer is over here next to the chair.
447495	449376	It's an Amiga, suddenly, and it wants toast.
449516	452437	The metal dance pads are in the bathroom.
454479	457040	I went in to take a shower today, and I'm like, what the fuck?
457180	459201	There's a dance pad on the floor.
461882	462423	It's a mess.
462723	466205	Anyway, so we would love to show this to you guys on webcam, but we have no way to do it.
466585	466965	Yes, we do.
467850	469891	I have the transfer cable and my telephone.
473011	478113	Okay, so maybe we'll figure something out, but for now... I really am too lazy to do that.
478153	481234	For now, we're patching in the Sacramento webcam.
481834	483494	So you can see the town where we live.
485355	490256	All I need is an STP program or someone to put it up somewhere for me.
490636	492897	But I'll take pictures with my cell phone.
493864	494985	Watch Desperate House what?
495025	497667	Actually don't, because that's on right now.
497687	498547	Watch... What other shows are on ABC?
521733	527058	Watch Lost Wednesday night at some time on News 10.
527718	530100	Unless you're not in Sacramento, then I guess you're screwed.
530921	532302	Followed by Temple of Butt.
532643	533003	Alright.
534644	537267	Yes, watch The Bachelorette because nobody else is.
538628	539889	Speaking of Temple of Butt...
541605	542767	We'll be back after this.
577674	580196	Thank you for watching
616241	617302	Disperse Disperse
646991	648012	Thank you for watching!
681841	682874	Thanks for watching!
709148	710150	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
738072	739672	I like the way it's a dudley
774242	774991	Thanks for watching!
907785	908265	and DarkSakura.
934057	934938	Oh, man.
936219	937180	All is good in the world.
937260	937840	All is good.
938121	938421	Sounds good.
938441	939262	For the most part.
940262	940863	For the most part.
941604	942765	That's why we have F.E.s later.
942785	944266	Well, yeah, we'll hear about the other half during F.E.s.
944486	947308	And also joining us, of course, where there's Mel B, there's Shark Skrull.
947649	948429	Hi, guys.
948529	949350	How you doing, hon?
950091	951772	I brought Lumines for you to ogle.
953153	954114	He actually has it, too.
954214	955335	I've already played it.
955635	957016	But you guys should do the wireless thing.
957036	957497	That might be fun.
957517	960800	Hey, at least you're not going to be, like, obsessing over me just for my PSP.
961934	963994	You have to tell that story on the air because it's too funny.
964455	965235	I'll make you tell that later.
965655	968375	So, you should go check out his games.
968395	969095	He's got quite a few.
969436	972336	So, anyway.
972596	975437	Dude!
976177	976697	What the hell?
976737	978597	Is that a Genesis portable thing?
978777	979698	A Nomad?
980858	981818	I have one of those, too.
982758	986679	And you know that you can use the Game Gear battery pack on this, too.
988314	992016	This is like portable gaming convention in the tsunami zone tonight here.
993277	1001542	I'm just checking out Moonwalker on the Nomad, and all I gotta say is, man, in times like these, who better of a superhero than a psychotic pedophile?
1004864	1007906	Anyway, in that break...
1009497	1015839	In that break, we heard Jesper Kidd with the Tengoku remix, or as some folks call it, .59.
1016600	1019741	Before that, Akira Yamaoka, 250 BPM.
1020261	1022262	Before that, DJ Naguro, Lin, 1999.
1022322	1023662	And starting us off, DJ Simon, 321 Stars.
1026503	1030507	All songs with numbers in them that break, because we're just stretching for themes tonight.
1031888	1035791	Anyway, this is the final night here in this studio.
1035811	1041536	We're going to be moving to a brand new studio in the next town over, Rancho Cambodia.
1041796	1042957	Or, I'm sorry, Rancho Cordova.
1042977	1045059	Okay.
1047284	1048144	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1068413	1070453	Look forward to that in future episodes and future webcams.
1070714	1073235	Again, though, the webcam tonight, not working.
1073795	1078977	Instead, we've patched through the Channel 10's Sacramento webcam, so you can just check out the river.
1081138	1081839	Did you really?
1081859	1083259	I was there earlier today.
1083359	1085020	And watch it slowly get darker.
1086261	1087241	Wow.
1087601	1088662	I know, isn't it fascinating?
1089042	1092584	It's about as exciting as our usual webcam when there's no guests here.
1094204	1095605	Where you get to watch the couch all night.
1096779	1100201	and then you can see it slowly get darker outside anyway
1102884	1108468	Since we won't be in this new studio technically for two weeks, we are not going to be here next week.
1109068	1111370	We are going to run a pre-tape show, though.
1111430	1113131	We're going to be partying next week.
1113191	1116914	So there will be a new episode of Orange Launch Radio, but it will be kind of different.
1116974	1121838	It's going to be kind of the way for us to kind of close the chapter on this.
1122018	1127462	Because really what's happening is that we're kind of, as I said, the theme is we are starting over.
1128632	1129113	DarkSakura.com
1147991	1150893	Orange Lounge Radio, What Gamers Really Want to Know
1169153	1172956	A lot of work and a lot of going to the gym and a lot of school.
1173617	1175619	I finished my retarded color wheel.
1175819	1177420	Pictures of it abound on the internet.
1180783	1182505	It's just really been a whole bunch of nothing.
1182705	1185267	I didn't get to play any Silent Hill, which I'm kind of disappointed about.
1185307	1192613	Although I did play Lego Star Wars on Xbox, which was actually pretty funny.
1193034	1196817	And you can play as General Grievous from the next movie.
1197833	1199274	Is it worth the buy just to laugh at?
1200515	1202516	It's entertaining but kind of frustrating.
1202796	1205138	I would recommend it to kids except there's a couple of hard levels.
1206019	1209821	But it's still kind of funny seeing a Lego mace.
1210342	1216566	The only reason I wanted to interrupt and ask is because my friend actually bought me Lego racers on the old 64 and that was pretty funny.
1217987	1219048	This one's just funny.
1221029	1226353	But yesterday I hung out with Julie all day shopping.
1227481	1229242	Ooh, Trader Joe's.
1229262	1230563	Girls going shopping.
1230603	1231164	Who would have thought?
1231184	1231604	For groceries.
1232124	1232885	Oh, hey.
1235607	1236808	Girls going shopping!
1239530	1241111	We did make fun of Paris Hilton a lot.
1242252	1242732	That's hot.
1246495	1256302	And I thought, there was this girl who, we were at the J Street Mall today, and there was this girl who was absolutely slutted up, wearing one of those little skirts that look like, you know, a lampshade cover.
1257370	1258751	and this halter thing.
1259051	1262813	And I wanted to stop her and ask her, say, I'm doing interviews of prostitutes.
1262853	1264033	What's it like living on the streets?
1268936	1270096	But I didn't feel too bitchy.
1271217	1271977	That's a first.
1272057	1273658	Because I had lunch at Hard Rock Cafe.
1273678	1274698	Oh, okay.
1275339	1276739	Do they have the Guinness burger?
1277980	1279040	They have a Guinness burger?
1279060	1280261	The buns are made with Guinness.
1280941	1281602	It's awesome.
1283082	1284503	I was like, carbs, yay.
1284763	1285844	I'm going to eat me this bun.
1288171	1290232	The buns are made with Guinness.
1290632	1290932	Wow.
1292633	1294154	And, oh, Thursday.
1294674	1298115	Because there was no karaoke because someone decided to go to something.
1298795	1299055	Sorry.
1301036	1303197	I went to Streets of London and had fish and chips and Guinness.
1303357	1303897	No, that's fun.
1304197	1304818	That made me happy.
1304838	1306298	And they had real football on TV.
1306458	1306999	That's right.
1307159	1310920	Streets of London is like... I'm sure every big town has something like this.
1311300	1313801	It's a British import pub, basically.
1313821	1314482	It is a pub.
1314702	1315482	Yeah, they basically...
1316162	1322367	They've kind of taken it on a giant crane and craned it over here to the United States and set it down in major cities.
1322788	1326811	And you can actually order cheaps the way they should be, the potatoes, you know.
1327171	1329813	And then you get to watch rugby and real football.
1330133	1332375	Real football because American football is crap.
1333456	1333896	I'm sorry.
1334037	1336699	Rugby is what you need to be watching because those men get bloody.
1338360	1340722	They have padding on their head and that's about it.
1341892	1345935	You know, because they have to, you know, have, you know, brain function, not like, what's-her-face.
1347056	1355062	Anyway, um, I went to the Crocker Museum today, just to look at stuff, because I had to do it for my art class.
1355482	1356663	There's some pretty cool stuff.
1356683	1359105	Now, what is, what is the Crocker Museum, for those not in the area?
1359165	1362828	It's an art museum, downtown SAC, in this really old house.
1363368	1367811	It made me think of a lot of the old houses in downtown Mobile, so it's sort of like, whoa, this is cool.
1368272	1370253	It's kind of a Victorian-style house, kind of.
1371134	1371274	Like,
1372602	1373662	The house itself was awesome.
1373682	1382508	They had a gallery for this Japanese artist there who did a lot of the representations of the old Kabuki actors.
1382728	1383088	Very cool.
1383128	1383568	It's pretty cool.
1384769	1387030	And then did things on the Genji story.
1387551	1388171	It was pretty cool.
1389312	1393715	And then I went to this one exhibit, though.
1394155	1397477	I swear the sculptures in that were like right out of Silent Hill.
1400242	1401643	I was like, this is pretty awesome.
1403343	1409465	And then I had to pick a picture that I really, really liked, and then I had to pick something that I hated and say why I hated it.
1409905	1415427	And the one I picked that I hated was called, like, Angels a la Mode or something.
1416728	1421469	It was this ceramic, shiny lady with this big poofy hair and little angels hanging all over her.
1421870	1422870	I was like, this is ugly.
1424090	1426351	That is a really odd comment to come back in.
1426431	1428512	I just start hearing about a ceramic lady with angels.
1430256	1431137	I went to the museum today.
1435519	1441222	And then the picture that I really liked, when you walk into the gallery, it's humongous, it takes up almost this whole piece of wall.
1442143	1450927	It's this old man who sort of looks like Patrick Stewart, sort of, but really, you know, shaggy beard, shaggy hair, laying down like he's dying.
1451548	1453689	But he looks really aware of himself.
1454489	1456971	But as you approach the picture... Sounds kind of erotic.
1458427	1461008	There's these pastel figures all scattered about it.
1461329	1471134	And for a moment I thought that this might be, it's called a glique, which is a giclee, that's what it's called, which is a digital... Wasn't that a movie with Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez?
1471254	1471534	No.
1471554	1471994	A giclee?
1474636	1475636	Just teasing.
1476757	1480399	But what that is is a digital image that's transferred to canvas.
1481659	1486342	And this was actually all done in acrylics on canvas, on this massive canvas.
1486667	1487207	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1517406	1518486	Your laundry's going crazy.
1518666	1520507	Yeah, I better go rescue my laundry from your machine.
1520527	1522788	What I was going to say is the washer walking off.
1523608	1524989	It's like, that's it, I quit.
1527150	1527730	I guess so.
1527830	1528690	I don't know what happened there.
1529170	1529450	Anyway.
1530571	1531431	Wow, that's a first.
1531551	1533732	Okay, anyway, moving on with how was your week, how was your day.
1533832	1541535	So hopefully if DarkSakura can get some pictures of her artistic day, she can post those up on the forums and you guys can check that out.
1542150	1544792	Alright, moving on with how was your week, how was your day?
1544813	1547235	Let's just go Shark Scroll, you got a mic next to you, why not?
1547375	1547695	What's up?
1548976	1553981	Well, obviously my day involved coming here, just for the heck of it.
1554021	1557784	I was like, yesterday I'm like, it's the last episode of Orange Lounge in that studio.
1558125	1558645	You wanna go?
1558665	1561408	And that was that.
1561488	1562669	Very cool.
1563209	1565912	So, I got a new job, new job is
1566457	1567297	Really quite nice.
1567517	1570518	It's a temp for a few months, so I get paid weekly, which is nifty.
1571218	1576319	And it's nice to work at a place where you don't feel like everyone's going to backstab you at any given second.
1576719	1578719	And you actually enjoy working with your coworkers.
1578819	1580600	So I've been very mellow lately.
1580620	1581740	So that's a good thing.
1581760	1582120	That's good.
1582200	1582540	That's good.
1582900	1584720	Yeah, so I'm kind of boring, but that's okay.
1584960	1585401	No, it's all right.
1585901	1586621	New jobs are fun.
1587361	1588861	And new jobs with lots of money are fun, too.
1589261	1589861	Yes, they are.
1590201	1590361	Yes.
1591282	1591682	Anything else?
1592322	1592362	No.
1592402	1593182	Any gaming stuff?
1593740	1599263	I've just been playing, like, Luminez, and I alternate between Luminez on the PSP and Zookeeper on DS.
1601504	1604505	Now, you and Loki outside, was he showing you how to hack your PSP?
1604545	1608047	Is that what he was doing outside, trying to hack into the neighbor's wireless internet?
1608267	1608807	Oh, he did!
1612009	1614070	It was not only tried, it was succeeded.
1614450	1616191	Do you have Wipeout on your PSP?
1616291	1617171	Yes, I have Wipeout.
1617191	1619492	I don't have it with me, but I have Wipeout, so I was finding out how to do it.
1619633	1620113	Oh, okay.
1620373	1621974	So learning from the best, I guess.
1622014	1622554	That's right.
1623154	1626856	So now you can drive around the neighborhood and see what wireless internet you can hack into.
1626896	1631958	Well, I have wireless at my house, so if I'm feeling lazy and just don't want to get on my laptop, you know, there you go.
1632318	1632699	There you go.
1633239	1633639	Absolutely.
1634539	1636040	Alright, moving on.
1636080	1639062	Now, Mr. Mel B, how was your week?
1639082	1639442	How was your day?
1640562	1641583	Week was pretty interesting.
1641603	1652188	I actually started a new job myself on Monday, working as an editor at this one place that actually does a lot of assessment and standards for kids, so like grades 5 through 11, I'd be
1653607	1659410	Basically editing and proofing a bunch of assessment tests, something like CTBS, SAT type stuff.
1659970	1664692	So it's kind of a cool job to get paid a good amount of money to tell people they're wrong.
1668334	1671355	Did Jamie just yell for a job application from the back?
1671395	1674236	I'm sorry.
1677458	1679699	For those who didn't hear that, Jamie said, I'll do that for free.
1681048	1692198	Yeah, it's good times, aside from the commute, being in, like, San Francisco, and I'm in, like, Redwood City, it's about, like, half hour and plus parking, and the city ain't always that great, but it's all good, but, uh, get a nice view.
1692618	1701285	Everything is pretty cool, I mean, it's, like, one of the most kickback jobs, like, it's eight hours, but I get my stuff done by one o'clock, and then I try to go to my boss's office to find something, you know, like, what to do.
1701666	1705209	She's stuck in meetings till, like, four o'clock, so I got three hours of dead time.
1705768	1709570	So, you know, it's all good, and I get to listen to Orange Lounge all day, so hey.
1709770	1710430	Alright!
1710790	1711131	You know?
1711151	1711551	Like that.
1712131	1713512	So, I'm feeling that.
1714912	1715973	Other crazy stuff.
1717134	1722876	Actually, it was funny, it was something mentioned on, I guess it was, yeah, DDR Freak a couple weeks ago.
1723236	1728119	Someone had put up, like, an unofficial, like, top 50 freestyle routines of all time in, like, North America.
1728739	1730060	And me and my boys, like...
1730987	1736288	We started coming up with this idea, like, maybe we should get a couple people, like, all together, get some ideas around it.
1736308	1745931	We actually wanted to put up a list of, like, top 100, you know, freestyles of, like, North American history, like, coming from a freestyler's perspective, coming from, like, someone who's just an avid fan.
1746031	1749492	And it's something that we're going to do, like, probably in a month or two.
1750112	1750792	I got it right now.
1750812	1757994	The first annual DDR freestyle history, I don't know, they can do some sort of, like, award show for that.
1758598	1760780	You know, have best improv routine.
1761140	1764763	Well, just do I Love the Freestyle and get House Sparks.
1764963	1765484	No, thank you.
1765524	1766404	That was my idea.
1766444	1768566	We'll get House Sparks to comment on everything.
1768626	1770668	I mean, yeah, we can start it off in like 1999.
1770728	1777534	And then we can go through every year who the big names were in 2000, 2001, all the way until now.
1777894	1780456	Like, yo, 2001, hand slaps and knee drops.
1780576	1782257	Yo, that was ill, man.
1782297	1783559	That was the greatest.
1783859	1784900	Post-18 videos.
1787998	1792421	You know, I was actually considering walking around with my Turnaroshi trophy, like Owen Hart.
1795542	1797604	That's right, I totally forgot you had one.
1797624	1798564	Wow.
1798604	1804888	But it's just some stuff like that, and we actually want to do something with Spot sometime when we can actually get, like, our database back in order.
1804908	1806749	I was going to say, Spot is going to be working again.
1807209	1812212	Yeah, right now, the thing is, like, our webmaster, you know, got our hands on our back end is in China right now, so...
1815134	1817757	That sucks when your website goes to China.
1818538	1820100	That's no fun at all.
1822542	1823603	But you know, we want to do something like that.
1823623	1825846	We actually want to get videos back up and all that kind of stuff.
1825906	1830111	It's like, because a lot of people, they've only seen stuff maybe 2002, 2005, you know.
1830151	1833054	It'd just be something because there's really nothing better to do.
1833683	1839725	I mean... Since there's no new arcade mixes or anything, we'll just reminisce about old arcade mixes.
1840305	1844166	Yeah, the longer we live, the more we remember DDR used to be good.
1846667	1853649	But speaking of that, I actually also posted up an article... If this is about what I think it is, I want to talk about this in more detail later.
1853969	1856330	Okay, yeah, well... Don't blow it just yet.
1856350	1859971	As a teaser, there was something that I posted up that will probably be talked about later.
1860231	1861612	Yes, definitely.
1863264	1865687	I'm like, we have three hours to fill, don't blow it all now.
1869370	1882343	See, other than that, just been kicking back for now, waiting for my E3 guest passes to come in next week, and all of a sudden I'm realizing there's a lot of friends I never knew I had, you know?
1884265	1887528	You know how that goes, it's like, I don't know, the way I see it, it's
1888106	1893428	You know, people usually offer, you know, if you get me into E3, I'll get you, you know, this, this, and this.
1893448	1895929	Man, what I gotta do is just get this stuff on eBay.
1895969	1899310	Like, I got Dutch Auction 10, you know, passes right here.
1899410	1900051	Everyone bids.
1900071	1901471	You're like, I'll get you dinner.
1901611	1902772	Reserve not yet met.
1905272	1911675	So, you know, it's just interesting to see how everyone becomes all chummy like a month before it happens.
1911755	1912775	But, you know, it's all good.
1913175	1914416	It's the price of fame, you know.
1914966	1919410	It'll be even more interesting to see how chummy people get with me when they see I have a media pass and can get fun goodies.
1921852	1924394	But, you know, that's pretty much the week in general.
1924434	1925675	Everything's been pretty cool.
1926496	1932081	As far as gaming, when I get a chance, I steal Luminous from Shark's Girl.
1932101	1937246	Other than that, I've just been like, I pretty much kill time playing San Andreas for the hell of it.
1937886	1940589	Because there's like so many, because I already beat the game like once.
1940629	1941389	I'm just trying to go for 100%.
1943072	1947413	So it's good times and that's basically the week in a nutshell.
1948273	1948633	Alright.
1949814	1953775	Mr. Islander, how was your week?
1953835	1954815	How was your day?
1954875	1955535	Week's been alright.
1956735	1957195	Let's see.
1957696	1959416	Work is pretty much there.
1960136	1964797	The only thing that I've been playing all week was actually Leisure Suit Larry Magna Cum Laude.
1967838	1968838	Any particular reason why?
1969839	1971399	I wanted it and it was on sale for like
1972649	1972909	30 bucks.
1973430	1974210	So I was like, alright, cool.
1974370	1974851	I'll pick that up.
1975451	1979934	Finished it in like, I don't know, maybe seven hours.
1982496	1986058	And aside from that, not really a whole lot of too much.
1987419	1990181	I actually went and played P.I.U.
1990201	1992562	today for the first time in like ages.
1992802	1994744	And to the non-hipsters, that's Pump It Up.
1995484	1996385	P.I.U., Pump It Up.
1999687	2001328	Yes, and I actually did play that song, actually.
2002614	2009035	But yeah, it was just pretty interesting just to go to a place that had video games and you put a dollar in the machine and it actually gave out quarters.
2010376	2011016	It's like, wow.
2011036	2012676	It's like I had to use it somewhere else.
2015357	2017377	I can get laundry money from a pump-it-up machine?
2017937	2018457	Yeah, really.
2018477	2019437	It was hot.
2019537	2020498	You have no idea.
2021718	2022938	But no, let's see.
2023318	2025239	Oh, I went to Denio's, walked around for a bit.
2025779	2027659	I found the greatest Eddie Guerrero shirts.
2028979	2029799	It was hell.
2029919	2030860	It was all hell.
2031020	2031260	It sucked.
2031580	2034961	This entire week sucked.
2051398	2055441	I started off with, I got, okay, first I started my new job, game sales.
2055761	2057763	That's all good, you know, starting to train and stuff.
2058984	2060285	And, you know, it's just grueling.
2060305	2068931	It's just very, they're having me, I'm fighting with this stupid person in Dallas because they think they know everything about, you know, certain games that are coming out.
2069111	2071012	I've been doing this for 18 years!
2071072	2077497	So, you know, first she, I'm like, she gives me this thing that says, you know, our new releases are coming up in May.
2077597	2079939	And the first thing that's on there is Ape Escape for the PSP.
2080839	2083980	I'm like, I think the state's wrong because it's in stores right now.
2084300	2085200	It was one of the launch titles.
2085700	2087020	No, it got pushed back to me.
2087461	2088181	No, it's in the stores.
2088261	2094162	I picked it up with my hand, thought about buying it, saw it sucked, and then put it back down.
2094942	2100004	And then she's like, there's this other title on there that was, what was it?
2100764	2103644	Hey Arnold, the movie, the game for the GBA.
2103884	2105145	I'm like, hold on, hold on.
2105965	2109226	Hey Arnold, the movie, the game.
2109906	2110446	Exactly.
2111667	2119009	Okay, and that game came out three years ago, when the movie came out, and she still insists it's a new release.
2119049	2123150	I'm like, okay, so that's when I had to get my boss involved.
2123471	2130513	He saw the emails go back and forth, and he joked with me, because he actually has a, he's understanding, so he's like, so you're trying to piss off, you know, the neighbor?
2131633	2133053	What the fuck is that kid doing right there?
2133794	2134874	Oh, giant paper airplane.
2137148	2138768	Fucking kids, stop distracting me!
2139249	2148211	Anyway, you're trying to piss off the Dallas people, but anyways, I'm trying to piss off the neighbor throwing the giant paper airplane.
2150672	2151712	What the hell is wrong?
2152532	2155173	What kind of inbred people do we have living around here, I swear?
2155777	2158418	Anyways, back to... I don't think we were in Mississippi.
2159058	2160219	Back to the story, okay.
2160799	2162219	So yeah, this has been going on all week.
2162279	2170783	What's kind of cool, though, is they're actually kind of serious about the game side of everything, so they're going to convert our conference room into a game room with a giant plasma screen TV, so that's kind of cool.
2172532	2173433	So I've been doing that.
2173753	2177937	And then this week, this weekend, I got to move!
2178517	2179338	Yay!
2179438	2181340	So this entire week was packing.
2181920	2184683	And then today and yesterday was moving.
2185223	2186444	And that sucked.
2187065	2188826	And I still have tons more left.
2189126	2191388	Let me just put it this way.
2191789	2194791	That arcade cabinet, I think, was never meant to move at all.
2195152	2196893	Because, you know, I tried moving it today.
2196993	2200116	First thing that happened, the wheels pushed through the bottom on the front.
2200540	2203002	So I was like, ah shit, that sucks, now it won't roll.
2203382	2210988	So then we sat here, leaned the cabinet back on its back wheels for a while, and I tried to reinforce the bottom with screws.
2211388	2214230	Set it back down, got it to the door, and it busted through the bottom again.
2214250	2215391	I was like, ah, fuck this.
2215892	2217373	So we finally got everything going.
2218514	2221096	Man, these kids are old school paper airplanes.
2221636	2222297	I swear to God.
2222657	2223237	Anyways, so we...
2225834	2227275	You know what?
2227375	2232359	When it comes down, when the battle is said and done, DS versus PSP, the winner, paper airplanes.
2234561	2235121	Thank you.
2237163	2237603	Oh, God.
2237643	2245309	Anyway, so finally, we got the cabinet to the house, and we had to wheel it around and finally got it in there.
2245349	2248051	We had to dodge this light that was by my door, and
2248889	2253551	The Fire Extinguisher in its glass case, you know, I had to dodge all that stuff.
2254532	2255352	Barely fit through.
2255372	2257013	And then you should have seen the couch yesterday.
2257033	2264096	Because, see, the way our apartment is set up, you've kind of got the two apartments right there and there's like a walkway that goes in front of both of them.
2264356	2269218	And then the apartment next to me has the sidewalk that's actually coming, you know, away from the apartment.
2269919	2275801	And for me, all I've got is this hole between the bush that's just about enough, you know, wide enough to fit the couch.
2276422	2276722	Just barely.
2276742	2276942	Barely.
2278186	2279907	The fuck is my phone ringing for?
2280607	2281327	God damn it.
2282447	2282807	Anyways.
2286829	2287129	Hello?
2288349	2289830	Did you forget you were trying to do a show?
2292311	2294931	This is why cell phones need to be turned off during the show.
2295712	2298032	Should we start playing the Jeopardy theme or something?
2299593	2300933	No, start making orgasm noises.
2301774	2303674	Okay, what that was, that was Nelly.
2304494	2305895	I'm going to get into this too, okay?
2306616	2318560	She was asking if I needed pants, because... Because you see... Because you see, yesterday, while moving... Hold on, hold on.
2318740	2320180	Let me just... Okay, let me think about this.
2321241	2328243	Mellie knows that you do a radio show on the internet that is nominated for Broadcaster of the Year.
2329383	2329743	Okay?
2330164	2333265	So we are one of five stations nominated Broadcaster of the Year.
2333385	2334325	So she understands...
2335149	2338192	What kind of commitment you put in Sunday nights.
2338793	2343837	She calls you, interrupts the show to ask you if you have pants.
2344678	2346160	Rob, I'm getting to that.
2346280	2347020	Okay, gosh.
2347180	2349182	I was the one that asked her, okay?
2349463	2354007	She was nice enough to go, to offer to get me pants at Walmart because the, you know.
2354946	2355787	Thanks for watching!
2371428	2381535	So basically, I had busted pants, you know, I have one pair of pants left that I'm not really sure if I have, so just to be on the safe side, I got a backup pair of pants just to make sure.
2381855	2382916	No!
2383537	2385838	Are you having problems with your ass?
2387259	2398107	So anyways, that is why she called, because she wanted me to, I was supposed to check to see if I had the pants in the dryer, and I didn't quite get to do that before the show, so...
2398968	2399588	Thanks for watching!
2418246	2424790	So then I had to go next door and drop the car off so, you know, I could see what's wrong because the check engine light's like, SOMETHING'S WRONG!
2425050	2426130	But I'm not telling you what.
2426531	2427311	SOMETHING'S WRONG!
2427591	2431213	It could be as little as the gas cap, or it could be your engine's falling apart.
2431693	2434235	But we're not gonna tell you, I'm just gonna turn on the light.
2435035	2439538	And you gotta take it down to the shop so they can laugh at you if it's something stupid, you know.
2439918	2445821	Which I checked the gas, you know, cap three times, all my fluids are fine, so it's nothing I did to the car.
2446368	2447529	It's just the car falling apart.
2447549	2448610	Your fluids are fine.
2448750	2450351	Does the car need pants?
2452233	2453353	The car does not need pants.
2453934	2455755	But yeah, last week... Give me pants!
2456556	2464322	Yeah, last week... Yes, I've seen... Yeah, that's true.
2464462	2470426	Anyway, so, pants, car, moving stuff aside, it's been an okay week.
2470486	2475230	It's just, it's one hell of a hectic week, and it's not going to get any better this week, so...
2475974	2476634	Um, oh well.
2476955	2481036	Our chat room, which I haven't plugged yet, www.orangeontrainer.com, click on chat.
2481056	2482317	There's already a ton of people in there.
2482357	2486199	I don't need to plug it because it's a party in there already, but hopefully some of you guys will want to join it.
2487459	2491121	We don't have the chat room, unfortunately, on the TV studio cam today.
2491241	2493022	Only I and DarkSakura can see it.
2493302	2499704	But we will pass along the messages, such as Firebomber has an explanation for why Loki is ripping all his pants.
2500805	2502786	Firebomber is suggesting you're getting fat, fatty.
2504427	2510071	I'm, okay, I'm not getting fat, it's actually not my ass that's ripping, it's the fucking crotch that's ripped out.
2510411	2512513	My nuts are too big for the pants.
2512853	2516135	Hold on, and then it goes on to say, Fatty McTubbs might have to lose some tons.
2517637	2522840	Hey, I've fucking got tons of exercise this week, lifting the goddamn couch and moving the cabinet and shit.
2523141	2525903	I've lifted enough boxes and done enough exercise this week.
2526363	2530326	And there was sex involved too, so goddammit, I've had my fill of exercise.
2535017	2535598	I'm finished.
2537039	2538220	Well, look, now you've done it.
2538280	2539301	Rob is speechless.
2540362	2541123	Angel, how was your week?
2541163	2541723	How was your day?
2543965	2545526	How the hell am I going to top that?
2545647	2545927	Wait.
2548109	2549030	That's what Nellie asked.
2556076	2558058	Whole new meaning to the term Swellhead.
2558818	2560200	She wasn't complaining this morning.
2564895	2566716	You're listening to KTMI.
2566796	2568538	Too much information all the time.
2572441	2574602	We're experiencing technical difficulties right now.
2577144	2578105	The host is speechless.
2578765	2580126	We've got big balls.
2580507	2581788	He's got big balls.
2582088	2583389	Let's try this again.
2584309	2585751	Angel, how was your week?
2585811	2586491	How was your day?
2586891	2587172	Pants.
2590914	2591595	Anyway, um...
2592634	2600856	Just, uh, working on school stuff, and, uh, work, and yada yada, and... Okay, guys!
2602717	2604817	Working on school and pets.
2607018	2609219	My pants are probably fine, thank you very much!
2613300	2620982	It could be a fortune cookie, I don't know, that's up to, uh... Instead of, like, adding in bed to your fortune, you add with pants?
2623608	2624068	Oh, no.
2626229	2626809	That could work.
2627049	2627389	Hmm.
2627969	2628609	No, no, no, no, no.
2628629	2629530	Don't make me think about that.
2631230	2632070	Um, yeah.
2632590	2635671	Just, um, I actually found time to play Final Fantasy XI this week.
2636251	2636671	Hmm.
2637952	2638392	Not really.
2638452	2640692	Not if I just picked it up this week.
2641352	2642193	All the time, anyway.
2644113	2647354	Yeah, okay.
2647374	2647974	That's it.
2648214	2648614	I'm done.
2649214	2651975	And, um, for the record, getting MPK just kind of
2653078	2654960	Wrong and interesting at the same time.
2656481	2661986	And I'm going to let Rob maybe fill in that blank because I'm not going to sit there and explain it again.
2663167	2664488	MPK and Final Fantasy XI.
2664528	2667290	Basically, she got scary monsters trained on top of her.
2667610	2668811	And it's no fun at all.
2669832	2672675	You should call GM on that guy.
2672915	2673175	Anyway.
2674116	2675937	Yeah, right.
2676138	2676498	Moving on.
2677246	2679267	My week and my day was pretty cool.
2679347	2682449	I can't top the pants thing, though, honestly, so I don't really know what I can say.
2683010	2684370	You can't top pants.
2685891	2693115	I did see Margaret Cho on Thursday, which was pretty cool, except it was a lot of recycled stuff from the last tour, which was kind of sad.
2694756	2695757	Oh, did you find pants?
2696377	2697538	Loki found pants, everybody.
2698378	2701180	Anyway, what else is going on?
2701360	2701740	Oh, I...
2706616	2707496	Did you say that on mic?
2707817	2719183	Okay, now yes, he did find pants, but for the record, he is currently wearing shorts, so it's not like he's completely bottomless here.
2721024	2723185	Something to note here.
2724686	2727627	And then I've also kind of been moving a little bit as well.
2727927	2729628	As I said, you know, got the keys to the new place.
2729688	2732390	My big move stuff comes next Sunday though, so I'm still here.
2732430	2735091	I was going to say, for having move stuff, there sure is a
2738492	2742374	I'm not moving until Sunday, but I kind of checked out the new place and that's about it.
2742454	2743974	Nothing big.
2744795	2745215	Let's see.
2746275	2746836	That's about it.
2747376	2749797	I really can't top the other stuff going on.
2751657	2753078	You know, we weren't here last week.
2754098	2756119	Everybody kind of had their own thing going on last weekend.
2756159	2759540	I went and saw Garbage, the band, in San Francisco, so that was cool.
2761521	2762362	They're not garbage.
2762462	2763282	They're actually pretty good.
2764520	2766841	Blah to you, I say, but I can top you.
2766942	2769103	I got to see Garbage and it was open for Alanis Morissette.
2769303	2770384	I hate you.
2771224	2773205	Anyway, all right, let's go to a break.
2773225	2774306	We definitely need a break here.
2774386	2778649	When we come back, more antics here on Orange Launch Radio, including some Bomani news.
2778669	2781090	There's actually been quite a bit in the past two weeks.
2781130	2783432	So the thing that Mel hinted at earlier, we'll get to.
2783932	2787354	Also, Politary says something relevant.
2787654	2788275	It's amazing.
2788775	2790576	We will get to that in a little bit.
2790896	2791497	In this break...
2792771	2795411	We're going to play Bomani songs with three-word titles.
2796192	2797852	I just wanted an excuse to play Temple of Love.
2797872	2798692	We'll be back after this.
2799252	2800032	More Orange Lounge Radio.
2849802	2862579	is all the power, helping you through the midnight hour, the secret of love and peace, soul and heart it will release, so, for your head and pray, it's gonna take you, be awake, flying like a snow dove, out, to the temple of love.
2986694	2988895	Turn around, look at what you see
3021517	3022693	All of the phages
3081618	3086402	Follow the sound, follow the sound, leaving the rain behind.
3087082	3092306	Together we'll be in harmony, taking the time we will find out.
3178729	3187891	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 139, the last episode of Orange Lounge Radio from our current studio.
3188031	3190531	This DDR sucks pants!
3204875	3206658	Let the joke die.
3206918	3208260	Step away from the joke.
3208280	3214088	Hey, if Deathgate could live into Final Fantasy XI this long, I can have pants joy.
3214869	3215230	Thank you.
3216147	3223391	I remembered something during How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day I wanted to talk about that I didn't get a chance to because I got sidetracked by pants.
3224972	3228454	I went to an antique store yesterday with my mom because my mom loves shopping for antiques.
3229194	3229595	Go figure.
3230555	3237279	And I was looking around and I actually saw these antique cactus jars and when I looked at them...
3237899	3239301	I could only think of one thing.
3239361	3240742	I thought of DDR.
3241002	3247409	And I'm going to post this link in the chat room there, so you guys can pull up that picture yourself if you want to look, because I took that picture on my cell phone.
3247789	3252994	Now, when you look at this, does anyone else think Gomlanda Couple right here?
3254476	3257399	This whole set, you want to know how much they wanted for this three-piece set?
3257419	3257399	$55.
3257439	3258940	I wanted it, though.
3263350	3267912	I was thinking about it, just to have that sad little Gumball and the Couple joke.
3267932	3268693	Wouldn't that have been funny?
3270034	3270314	Anyway.
3273916	3274336	Moving on.
3275097	3278699	We're going to open up our Skype line in a little bit, but first I want to talk about some DDR news going on right now.
3279219	3284963	Did you know, boys and girls, that there is a brand new DDR game coming out?
3286267	3289149	It's probably something you'll never ever ever be able to afford.
3289589	3292771	It's actually a DDR fitness game.
3293071	3298615	So Mel, if you don't mind, I'm sorry, you're having a psych conversation there, I'm totally interrupting.
3299896	3302717	Tell us a little more about the DDR fitness project.
3302757	3303298	What's going on here?
3303478	3307680	Alright, well just to give a quick background on how it all came about and such.
3308361	3315105	There was a convention about two or three weeks ago called the URSA, which is like the International Health Racquetball Conference.
3315435	3339689	Sports Association, I know there's like an international racquetball association out there but that said they have like an expo every year and it usually showcases a lot of stuff in fitness so there's often a lot of like fitness equipment like treadmills, exercise machines, they have a lot of people like GNC they go out there and they promote their vitamins that kind of stuff so basically the whole thing is a bunch of people running around in spandex that's what the convention is.
3340450	3344415	No, but see, the thing is, you might think that's bad, but you're thinking, you know, from an anime con standpoint.
3344575	3347279	These people work out and take care of themselves.
3347599	3348761	It's not a bad thing.
3348961	3349922	Send in more Manfei.
3352005	3352446	Essentially.
3352706	3354889	But Konami actually had a booth there.
3355780	3360083	And Konami's booth was actually Konami Tokyo's sports division.
3360644	3365707	And they actually do stuff like tread, they actually, Konami does a sports line of equipment.
3365727	3368489	They do treadmills, they do like weight machine stuff.
3368549	3370350	It's actually kind of neat just, you know, shortly.
3370731	3372172	They do stuff that's like computerized.
3372192	3378116	So like if you have a treadmill, you can actually like have a screen in front of you where you can like surf the web, you can like watch satellite TV.
3378596	3390943	There's really neat things that it actually has a computer chip that you wear around your wrist where you can go around like all bunch of different machines in one gym and it'll actually track how many calories you've been burning along the way with all the different machines.
3391284	3392945	Konami does a lot more than people think.
3392985	3395406	Konami is not just about, you know, DDR and Castlevania.
3395466	3396967	There's a lot more to Konami.
3396987	3405992	They actually, and when I go to the casino, I always see slot machines that were done by Konami and that just trips me out because I always think of Konami as, oh, you know, DDR and Gradius, right?
3406373	3406493	But...
3407823	3436581	Konami does a lot more than people think sometimes so yeah sports is like their big thing over in Japan and well getting more towards relevant stuff I guess they were actually showcasing something called DDR Studio which is basically sort of like what DDR could be in a fitness club type atmosphere obviously there are limitations with a home console whereas like Xbox you can only play up to four people you know well what if like you want to have a whole bunch of people going out there
3437113	3464866	so there's this program that they showed and how it worked was you have like wireless pads and you can play up to like eight players you know on this demo and what it is is you have like one instructor up front kind of like in any other aerobics class they'd be giving you like showing off the routine so there would be a game of DDR going but more so instead of paying attention to the screen and looking at the arrows and you know timing your steps like we all do just because we're
3465734	3493861	like all conditioned for DDR they actually take you through a routine which is almost like for all intents and purposes it's like freestyle only they're teaching it to you along the way and they do all different types of programs with it's really neat they do stuff like stretching programs like there's one that's like yoga tai chi type stuff where you go into like different poses and you hold freezes and such and then they do stuff that's a little more advanced like you do like a Muay Thai kickboxing type thing so in a way it's almost sort of like martial beat only like a lot less weird
3494941	3496482	I thought that was interesting.
3497002	3502866	The story that you posted over on DDR Freak kind of talks about a little, and if people want to see the story, of course, head on over to DDRFreak.com.
3502886	3504226	They have more information there.
3504266	3505247	It's their top story right now.
3506548	3510810	It talks about that there's actually additional symbols, like there's stars and stuff that are used.
3511510	3520076	In addition, the way the graphic interface is set up is you basically have the step gauge in the center of the screen and onto the sides of it.
3520457	3528743	They have players one through eight, one through the odds on one side, the evens on the other, and it tracks how many calories you burn, just like in workout mode in DDR.
3529703	3531445	On top of that, what it does is...
3532677	3538219	The additional symbols you have is a fist that you see coming up, and the fist will either say LOR.
3538619	3543560	So when that comes up to the step gauge, that's your, the step zone, that's your cue to throw a left punch or a right punch.
3544040	3545761	It's variant, of course, obviously by the routine.
3545781	3547781	Sometimes there'll be a jab, sometimes there'll be an uppercut.
3548101	3551362	It's dictated by the actual workout routine itself.
3551622	3556384	And then there's one that's a star that tells you, prompts you to do a kicking type motion.
3556684	3560125	So it could either be like a knee thrust or it could be like a forward lunge kick or a side kick.
3561775	3567917	So it's really trying to take this DDR being a fitness thing and taking it one step further, really.
3568717	3569458	Ninjas!
3569678	3571278	They're creating ninjas, people!
3571318	3572179	Don't you see?
3572759	3573199	Ninjas!
3573459	3575140	Kicking and punching, what more do we need?
3575160	3575740	They're ninjas!
3575760	3583182	24-hour ninjas coming soon to a 24-hour fitness near you.
3584063	3586743	Wow, that's like eight times three ninjas to movie, man.
3589604	3590105	Wow, wow.
3592289	3596732	No, but I mean, I guess a lot of people, I mean, that's the basic premise of it.
3596992	3608600	The cool thing I noticed about like the hardware is, you know, I said they're using wireless pads, but the pads that you see out there aren't really like the consumer ones you see, which are like kind of, you know, the vinyl over and then that, you know, the foldable soft pads.
3608940	3611422	They actually use a somewhat semi-hard pad.
3611742	3616365	What it is, it's sort of like they use a hard rubber, which is kind of like what they use in car floor mats.
3616905	3619547	So it's pretty rubbery and it's very durable actually.
3620240	3626765	and I don't think they, they said that it wasn't necessarily wireless, it was more like a Bluetooth type infrared type technology that they used.
3627366	3629427	So, I mean, that was just another tidbit of that.
3630808	3635612	And they actually work with PS2s, so if there was a way I could ever actually get my hands on that, I'd so be there.
3638359	3646505	But the thing about, I guess, what a lot of people are commenting is, you know, a lot of people, especially in the just online community, are saying like, great, where's our arcade mix?
3646786	3647826	Boohoo, no one cares.
3647866	3649127	You're like, this is fitness.
3649267	3650528	The last thing we need to see is this.
3650569	3661417	It's like, the way I see it right now, if Konami's arcade division does not want to go in the route of, you know, Dance Dance Revolution, and obviously they don't want to do something in America, this is their only alternate route.
3661457	3666581	Because if they keep targeting the same gamers, you know, like on the consumer level,
3667233	3669074	I do think Loki's got a comment.
3669114	3672296	Let's hope to God that they have these pads at E3 instead of the crappy soft pads.
3687012	3687973	All mentioned at the Jason.
3706840	3708481	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
3719164	3724849	By bringing it into a gym, it kind of legitimizes it a little bit versus that crazy game that all the gamers play.
3724889	3729793	It's like, oh, hey, it's something that other people who may not play games for any other reason can go and do.
3730053	3737699	So it kind of makes it less of a bastard stepchild in a way and brings it back into the forefront and can definitely bring some new people into it.
3739601	3742263	I mean, they're going for the right target audience right now.
3742944	3745926	Like I said, you're going for a whole new audience, bringing them into DDR.
3745946	3748088	You're bringing people who are fitness goers because, like,
3748459	3748819	DarkSakura.com
3774276	3779278	That doesn't have children, you probably have never heard of DDR, honestly.
3779578	3786081	Because either your kids showed you what DDR was, or you're a gamer adult, like most of us are here, and you found DDR on your own.
3786361	3790763	But if you're a non-gamer adult, I can totally see how you've never heard of DDR, honestly.
3791063	3794765	Especially if you're a gym bunny, and you don't have time to go to the arcades.
3795145	3795985	So, it makes sense.
3796365	3796905	No comment.
3800219	3803060	But DDR50 Studio, it's actually a pretty fun game.
3803100	3804400	I actually got to try it out myself.
3805261	3811443	When you go through a whole DDR studio, like the demo that they did, it was about like 25 minutes straight of DDR, of like working out.
3812003	3820105	And it was a lot of, it was pretty hectic and nothing says like strenuous like boxing the Kakumei.
3823246	3824087	I gotta see this.
3824127	3826707	I'm really curious if anybody in this area is gonna get it.
3826727	3827568	I wanna see it.
3827688	3828708	It sounds kinda neat.
3829472	3830632	Can we expect to see pictures?
3830653	3832113	Are they going to do a website for it or anything?
3832133	3832393	Any promos?
3832413	3833954	What songs do they have on there?
3833994	3841116	A lot of songs I noticed were from, like, there were actually, I think most of them I caught were, like, from Beatmania type of songs.
3841756	3845698	But, like, the one I definitely remembered was, um, was all Kakumei.
3845738	3850519	I think one was, like, something from, I think it was Beatmania 6th, actually.
3851160	3853940	Wait, are there songs in this that have not been in DDR yet?
3854321	3857682	Um, yeah, there are some that are, like, yeah, pretty, like, just new, new.
3857942	3858282	Huh.
3859356	3875489	I'm trying to get a bunch of stuff from Jason about it, but the thing is, it's like, you know, Konami's not going to be willing to give us any video footage, so I'm just trying to get either a press release or just get some stills, because I know they were doing stills that day, and I would have brought my DigiCam, but...
3875990	3877991	You know, I wasn't able to get it.
3878071	3879232	That's very surprising.
3879332	3885556	I just assumed that they had taken, like, Max 2 and converted it for this with all those same songs.
3885596	3886577	That's very surprising that there's new stuff.
3886597	3889538	I'm wondering if there will be a home release at some point of something like this.
3889859	3892360	Because, you know, you're going to get people who are like, hey, this is kind of fun.
3892580	3894081	Oh, hey, I can do this at home, too.
3894762	3895022	You know?
3896162	3897623	I'm sure that's the direction they want to go.
3897643	3900205	It would be a pretty smart marketing round, definitely.
3900560	3907845	The other interesting thing to see on that line would be if they make it like, you know how they have those Atari things where you just plug in a joystick and it's like all the old school Atari games?
3908205	3914449	Because adults who aren't gamers don't have any other reason to get a PlayStation or Xbox, and that just makes the system a heck of a lot more expensive.
3914809	3918472	Maybe just like some sort of standalone thing where you plug it in and plug the pad in and you're ready to go.
3918663	3919784	That's actually a really smart idea.
3920644	3921945	You've seen those DDR.
3921985	3922905	You can see these at the mall.
3923165	3924246	They suck.
3924286	3925506	They're shitty little things.
3925826	3929628	They're like MIDI songs.
3930649	3931069	They're horrible.
3931089	3932530	My sister bought that for my nephew.
3933470	3935891	Wasn't the one that has Survivor by Destiny's Child?
3935911	3937892	That was basically it, yes.
3937992	3940213	It's basically playing DDR on the Game Boy.
3951513	3963437	Well, it'll be interesting to see what develops with this.
3963697	3971120	Now you've got me all interested with that song list because it makes me think, hmm, could the songs they're using in this be something we see in the next home release?
3972297	3973558	I don't know.
3973938	3977261	I'll keep talking to the contacts and get what I can.
3977621	3978081	Sounds good.
3978342	3982184	Does this have an official name yet?
3982485	3983465	It's called DDR Studio.
3983505	3985086	Basically, it's out in Japan.
3985467	3990550	Right now, it's patent pending in America right now because essentially that's what we were doing at the convention.
3990570	3996234	We were pitching the idea to a bunch of people who were managers of fitness clubs and such.
3996815	4000998	Essentially, if they garner enough interest, then it's something they'll move forward with.
4001587	4008048	So it's strictly conceptual on this side of the world, but it's very much reality elsewhere.
4009729	4013430	You know, if this does show up at my local gym, I am definitely going a lot more.
4013970	4014510	Oh, hell yeah.
4015630	4017831	I would go much more as well, so it'd be interesting.
4020071	4022632	Might be motivation for me to get my fat ass up and exercise.
4022952	4025532	And Loki, good excuse for you to ruin more pants.
4028490	4029891	What the hell is going on here?
4030171	4032551	Jonas just showed up and he brought a PSP as well.
4032732	4033592	And he brought us dinner.
4033712	4036913	It's only because he came last week when we were doing the show.
4036973	4038594	Yeah, that's kind of sad.
4038854	4042355	Don't you feel like the odd child left out that doesn't have a PSP?
4042475	4043295	You're so not cool.
4043315	4043735	I do.
4043895	4045156	I am not cool, actually.
4046105	4049727	We're going to open up the Skype line in a little bit, but first a couple of quick things.
4050668	4059393	Shark Scroll, I actually, speaking of PSP, you have an interesting story about how the PSP can sometimes take your place.
4060654	4063115	The PSP, the DS, anything?
4064096	4065736	Did you want to talk about, you don't have to talk about this.
4065757	4067057	Do we want to have the story now?
4067137	4067938	Yes, have the story now.
4068238	4070859	Okay, so I have a friend.
4070899	4071640	What are you doing?
4072984	4074444	I gotta stop you for real quick here.
4074704	4079745	Jonas just walked in with a lovin' lamb and a ball gag.
4081145	4083886	An inflatable sex lamb and a ball gag.
4083946	4085546	Jonas, Jonas, hi Jonas.
4086006	4088527	Jonas, come here, come here, get on the mic, Jonas.
4090007	4097308	I'm sorry, Sharks girl, but when inflatable lambs and ball gags are brought into play, I don't give a shit about your PSP story anymore.
4097328	4098228	I hope you'll understand.
4098949	4100349	Alright, love ya.
4102816	4109037	Jonas, now, remind me, you went 40 days with no boner for Lent, right?
4109317	4109557	Yeah.
4109717	4116219	Okay, how do you go from no boner for 40 days to bringing... Yes, I survived.
4116319	4124680	How do you go from the... Islanders just finding this out for the first time.
4125721	4131902	Jonas, how do you go from being Mr. No Boner, for lack of a better term,
4133112	4141496	to bringing to this show, which has nothing to do with sex last time I checked, an inflatable lamb and a ball gag.
4142310	4142950	Please explain.
4143351	4143851	Okay.
4144271	4146172	For those who don't notice, I just turned 22 yesterday.
4146192	4146792	Happy birthday!
4149654	4154337	And a lot of people gave me some sex stuff, so... So why did you bring it here?
4154717	4157358	Did you think that we... Did you think... Oh, God!
4157778	4160220	You know, it's the last episode of Orange Lounge in that studio.
4160480	4161621	Let's all fuck a sheep!
4161781	4162381	Let's do it!
4170638	4171238	You know what?
4171338	4174760	If DarkSakura gets too angsty tonight, we'll just shove this ball in her mouth.
4174780	4176481	You know what?
4176761	4177301	Fuck that.
4184665	4187426	Jonas, I don't know what to do with you sometimes.
4188527	4190148	Alright, anyway, back to Sharks Girl.
4191568	4192829	Yes, please, back to Sharks Girl.
4193874	4195895	I'm sorry, Shark Skrull, but I had to go there.
4195915	4199377	And you know what's funny is that's just like so par for the course for this story.
4200857	4203339	Better than being hijacked by Loki's pants.
4205099	4209662	Anyway, please, your story about the DS, PSP, etc.
4209682	4213944	Okay, I have a friend who is not of any of the circles that anyone knows.
4214004	4214544	He moved away.
4214584	4215064	He moved back.
4215104	4215504	Long story.
4215584	4216685	Anyway, so...
4217287	4217547	Islander.
4217567	4217747	Harass.
4249172	4251334	Anyway, sorry.
4251714	4256478	Anyway, so I'm known for being a bit of the gadget junkie.
4256538	4259080	If it's cool and a new toy, I want it.
4259360	4262423	So I have the iPod.
4262483	4264785	I almost ended up with a second iPod last weekend.
4264985	4265785	I have the PSP.
4265805	4266306	I have the DS.
4266326	4267187	I have all the fun little things.
4267407	4268407	Your Veruca game.
4268748	4270369	I want it, and I want it now, Daddy.
4272771	4273672	Yeah, pretty much.
4274052	4275093	She is a consumer whore.
4275113	4276114	And how.
4276294	4276794	And how.
4276834	4277274	Anyway, sorry.
4277294	4277895	I keep interrupting.
4278581	4284183	So I meet up with said friend and show him, oh, look, I got this nifty new Nintendo DS.
4284303	4288225	He has proceeded to yell at me if I don't bring the DS with me every time I see him now.
4289546	4293167	So then he told me not to get a PSP and I ignored him and got a PSP anyway.
4294288	4296149	And so I said, oh, look what I got a PSP.
4296329	4298309	And now all he wants to do is play the PSP.
4298389	4306353	So yes, my friends, I have gone from being seen for just, you know, my loving, charming self as an excuse to
4306980	4308141	Get to play a DS and a PSP.
4308181	4309502	And he gets pissed off when I don't bring him.
4309562	4314487	So, I've decided to screw that, especially when he destroyed two of my games, I found out, when I tried to sell them.
4314647	4315068	Whoa.
4315628	4318511	Yeah, I lent him two... What did I lend him?
4318551	4324757	Two PS2 games, and they were perfect, pristine, and now they're scratched to the point that the place won't buy them back.
4325597	4327759	So, I'm being used for video games.
4327799	4328480	Isn't that fun?
4328960	4332724	I'm not even rich, and I don't really have all the new stuff, but...
4333490	4334410	Thank you for watching!
4359435	4360958	And of course, you show it to me and what do I do?
4360978	4362119	Oh, I already played that.
4367247	4370152	So yes, lesson of the story, don't use your friends for their video games.
4370192	4370693	It's not cool.
4371113	4371434	Alright.
4373116	4373777	Anyway, um...
4375359	4381322	We are going to open up the Skype line so you guys can call in because I'm sure you guys have plenty of comments here on this show going on so far.
4382142	4384183	But first, a couple quick announcements.
4384424	4389326	Today is the last day that you can vote for the Live365 Awards.
4389366	4398190	They are closing the polls at midnight, so please, please, please, please, if you haven't yet already, please head on over to Live365.com.
4398270	4401532	Actually, head on over to OrangeLoungeRadio.com and right at the top...
4401992	4406577	Underneath the webcam, which by the way, the sun is starting to set here in Sacramento, as you can see on the webcam.
4408932	4415456	You can actually see right underneath the webcam, there's a little box that says, Thank you Live365 and Orange Lounge Radio listeners, a little logo.
4416036	4418818	Vote for us in the best of Live365 2005.
4419618	4432245	There's a link right there, www.live365.com slash broadcast slash bcawards.live Since you're listening to this station, you're already a registered Live365 member.
4432305	4435227	So, please, go to the website and vote.
4435567	4447878	Now, I'm hearing a rumor that they're only counting VIP and other broadcasters, but from what I'm hearing, anybody can see the ballot, so I'm encouraging everybody to go vote.
4448159	4452202	Even if they are not going to count your vote for whatever reason, at least show your support.
4452303	4455525	At least make them go, gosh, we have to throw out all these votes for Orange Lounge.
4455566	4457147	What a bunch of bastard people we must be.
4459249	4462570	Let's forget him again this year.
4463170	4464631	Should I play that little reminder there?
4464711	4466171	Oh, I just got booted from IRC.
4466211	4466751	That's not good.
4468252	4469592	Is the monitor stream still going?
4469612	4471173	Yes.
4471193	4475274	The router and cable modem is fine.
4475294	4478355	Yes, the internet's still up, but for whatever reason... And it's still setting.
4478935	4480636	The sun is still setting in Sacramento.
4481954	4487459	For whatever reason, we just got the boot from IRC, so we will make our way back into the chat room shortly here.
4488020	4489761	Well, shoot, I was going to post that link in chat.
4491123	4492304	All right, we'll get back in IRC.
4492684	4495026	I guess in the meantime, we could go ahead and open up the Skype line.
4495066	4495627	How's that sound?
4496748	4497348	Boy, oh boy.
4498269	4499871	Let's open up the Skype line.
4500811	4502572	Remember to call into our show.
4502652	4507034	All you have to do is head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com.
4507194	4512596	Click on Interact With Us, and you can download a little program called Skype that you can use to interact with us.
4512676	4517778	Please, guys, tonight, try to keep the calls kind of brief because we're expecting a lot of people want to get in tonight.
4517838	4519358	So we'll start it off with our first caller.
4519378	4520639	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4521482	4522403	My Dennis Akum here.
4522803	4523364	Yes, my friend.
4523384	4523904	What's on your mind?
4525566	4526166	Let me see.
4526246	4529849	Just the comments and how, you know, DDR is taking a new path.
4530950	4537115	Just basically, instead of focusing on more of the gameplay, just focusing on the exercise.
4537336	4539377	It's a step in another direction.
4539678	4540238	Exactly.
4540278	4540879	That's what I said.
4540959	4542620	It's kind of like another branch in the road.
4543161	4543381	Okay.
4543401	4543481	Okay.
4544381	4554183	And so, I mean, I still have hopes that they're going to make another arcade mix, but I don't expect that, you know, I'm not so fixated on the fact that it is.
4554844	4556544	But in reality, it might be possible.
4558024	4560105	I'm trying not to lose hope over it.
4560385	4561505	No, but think about it.
4561545	4565106	Logistically, it's possible because they could do it through a third party.
4565586	4570007	Like, as you know, Betson is their official distributor.
4570027	4570427	Okay.
4570447	4570548	Okay.
4573283	4580847	So if they ever wanted to make a mix in America and they needed to bring it out there, they could use them to distribute.
4582328	4583469	An idea.
4583669	4590052	I mean, we're not presidents of Konami Distribution or anything, so we would know, but you never know.
4590913	4591813	It's an option.
4592874	4602539	Yeah, it's right there in place because even though they shut down their American operations, they can still make the cabinets in Japan and ship them over here, assuming they have a distributor.
4604741	4625738	Yeah, but you know, I'm just, you know, I don't know, I mean, this whole DDR Studio thing, yeah, it sounds promising, I just hope that, you know, it could just make DDR, you know, not something that would overkill the exposure, but just something that would make it known to almost the average Joe.
4626767	4629691	because Average Joe Sixpack won't even know what DDR makes.
4629711	4641024	Well, yeah, as you were saying earlier, you can't complain about DDR Studio because, of course, like what, the third reply in that thread was, fuck this game, we want new Konami arcade stuff.
4641244	4641625	You can't...
4642125	4644286	I want it in the green studio!
4645327	4646848	Don't even let me go there yet.
4647928	4652851	But any new DDR is going to be good for the scene as a whole because it's more exposure.
4653732	4654933	Exactly.
4655033	4657734	Konami's probably playing it both ways.
4658154	4669161	Trying to appease the scene that pretty much built DDR in this country and then trying to do their own thing by trying to branch out and focus on one aspect of DDR.
4672344	4674005	It's kind of like that.
4674025	4675046	They're playing both ways.
4675106	4679290	That's pretty much what Konami's doing.
4679450	4685555	We don't even know whether or not there's going to be another mix in the fall or something like that, or in the near future.
4685575	4690139	Well, we do know that there is one thing that's going to be shown at E3 this year, for sure.
4690199	4693742	DDR with Mario is definitely going to be shown at E3.
4693862	4695663	IGN leaked that one earlier this week.
4695683	4696524	We know about that, so...
4697285	4700288	But what is Konami going to do to follow up Xtreme and Ultramix 2?
4700668	4701108	Tell me that.
4701188	4703971	Well, the assumption is something is coming.
4704011	4713140	They can't just leave us hanging with that, but... They could, I don't know, I could just throw it out there and they probably could port Party Collection to this country and then basically, you know, shoot themselves in the foot.
4713240	4714561	Well, nah, I... Because...
4716713	4720938	DDR Extreme was such a radical departure from DDR Extreme in Japan.
4721359	4723902	Wouldn't you logically think that we're going to get something brand new?
4724142	4725303	They're not going to port us something over?
4725323	4726385	We're going to get something new?
4727706	4731831	I don't even know what the Japanese, whatever's left of the DDR scene over there...
4732811	4739317	You know, the whole, whoever still plays there actually thinks of the new songs that were actually made for Ultramix, you know, and Ultramix 2.
4740158	4747564	It's really hard to see what they think and how, you know, this is based, you know, on how Ultramix 2 and how we managed to make our own mix.
4747984	4750687	Something that, you know, American DDR players could call their own.
4751597	4752938	Oh yeah, I agree.
4752998	4756860	The recent US mixes have far surpassed their Japanese.
4757220	4763843	Song list arguments aside, I mean, Big Boo Hoo, Cartoon Heroes hasn't been released in the US now.
4764644	4768366	The games themselves have surpassed Big Boo Hoo.
4769166	4776490	What they lacked in popular songs from DDR Extreme, they made up for with brand new ones from 2DX and other Bomani.
4777364	4787133	So you can't argue with that, that they're actually branching out into 2DX and really, you know, really, they're branching out into Bomani that these DDR players are most likely to play.
4787293	4789355	Alright, someone who's been on the inside wants to comment.
4789375	4790616	Hold on, hold on, Taku, hold on.
4791851	4799235	I was just, I mean, I might be a minute or two behind, but I was hearing something about how, like, the US can break it out into their own as far as, like, DDR goes.
4799676	4807740	I think that's what was the intention of when Konami of Hawaii was basically assigned to do Ultramix and basically the whole Xbox series.
4808461	4810362	It's probably, I mean, the reason why I think Ultramix 2...
4811175	4822119	You know, was the way it was, was because it was essentially, there was a lot of feedback from the American audience, from, you know, Right, hell, we even made the steps for the songs.
4822499	4822959	Who's we?
4822979	4825920	Yo, wait a minute, Saku, you didn't do it!
4826440	4835043	No, I mean, we as DDR players, I mean, you know, as a DDR player, Well, you know, if you're saying that, you know, someone like me represents everyone of you.
4835223	4836744	Let the man finish, Saku, let the man finish.
4836984	4837784	I mean, you know, it's...
4838955	4845181	It's something, but to say that's going to be the end of it, I don't think that's necessarily true.
4845322	4850427	Obviously, we're not going to let you telegraph what we're doing six months down the road or whatever.
4850867	4854171	In all fairness, I don't even work for the company anymore.
4854291	4858175	But I just want to trip.
4858235	4858776	I mean, it's like...
4859286	4867535	If you really want to basically have power as far as dictate what Konami does, buy 51% of their stock.
4867555	4872600	I don't even know if that's available, but at $20 a pop, that's a lot, man.
4872860	4876024	Saku, we've got to let you go because other people are trying to get in, but thank you so much for calling.
4876044	4876444	Have a good one.
4878695	4884517	Alright, so, you know, again, to sum that one up, any exposure for DDR is going to be a good thing.
4885278	4885998	And the U.S.
4886098	4894101	definitely breaking out into their own with Ultramix 2 and DDR Extreme being so radically different from its Japanese counterpart this year.
4894141	4894841	Let's take another call.
4895261	4896202	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4897202	4898502	Hey, Sky, it's Al Mullet.
4898562	4899163	Hello, Al Mullet.
4899183	4899763	What's on your mind, buddy?
4901843	4904688	This is one hell of a show you got going on right now.
4905390	4912405	It's always these shows where we come in, and honestly, I'm going to be honest, like five minutes before the show started tonight, I was just going...
4913337	4915077	Let's just get this over with.
4915177	4916158	I have a headache.
4916358	4918858	I want to get through this show so I can go back to bed.
4919438	4925740	And now it's like, why is it whenever I approach the show with that attitude, the shows end up being just chaotic funness?
4926280	4929100	Well, I'm glad you approach things with a bland attitude, Skye.
4929140	4931661	It makes it greater for the rest of us.
4931901	4937842	Aren't the rest of you so comfortable knowing that, you know, I approach this show with such a positive attitude?
4939883	4940803	Oh, yeah, let's do this again.
4940843	4941803	All right, what's on your mind, Emily?
4942828	4947591	I recently came into Beatmania 2DX 9th style and I've been having a ball with that.
4948172	4950353	I don't know if that's good to do to a machine, but okay.
4951334	4952915	Just stop it, Loki.
4952935	4953596	Just stop it.
4953736	4955557	Loki, you already lost this show.
4955657	4961041	Don't go for two.
4962702	4963463	I'm sorry, Elmo.
4963563	4965144	I apologize for Loki's behavior.
4965985	4966545	No, don't.
4966585	4969567	At least I get to burn on him once before you go to your next studio.
4969987	4970908	We're not dying.
4971108	4972129	We are starting over.
4973894	4974454	Good for you.
4974494	4975035	It's new.
4975795	4976135	All right.
4979117	4979397	All right.
4979657	4980718	So what else is on your mind now, Mullet?
4981738	4982539	You got Nine Style.
4982979	4988842	I got Nine Style, and I do have a PSP now, and I do have Luminous for it.
4989582	4993364	And I do have a couple other games that are currently collecting dust.
4993584	4999768	I would like to make a note that currently there are at least three or four PSPs in this room, and I think at least three of them are playing Luminous.
5001489	5002109	As they should.
5004797	5013026	It's the one game that I can honestly say is the only reason right now that a PSP should be bought right now.
5013087	5020815	Well, I'm kind of waiting for PopCap to rip it off like they do all the other puzzle games so that I can play Luminous online.
5020975	5022457	But they'll probably call it, you know...
5023328	5025891	Force or Magic Squares or, you know.
5026412	5027373	Musical Squares.
5027413	5029135	Musical Squares or something, you know.
5029315	5033420	You know, PopCap.com, they rip off all the good puzzle games and make their own version.
5033440	5034341	I'm going to tell them that name.
5034381	5037946	I'm going to go to PopCap and say, I have a title for your Luminous ripoff.
5038326	5038927	There you go.
5039107	5039848	Give me money.
5041149	5041450	All right.
5042922	5047085	and we could call it Puzzle Pants as some folks in the chat room are... Oh boy.
5047726	5047946	Anyway.
5049467	5053511	What do you think about the whole DDR stuff at E3 this year?
5053531	5054431	What do you think we're going to see?
5054491	5063819	We know that we're going to be seeing DDR with Mario per the earlier Orange Entree report that said IGN blew the lid on that and that we are going to see DDR with Mario at E3.
5064139	5066101	What do you think else is in store for us at E3?
5066961	5069964	I think we're going to see PS2 and Xbox generations.
5070405	5074449	We didn't know it was coming in 2002 when DDR Max was announced.
5074509	5081296	We didn't know anything was coming in 2003 when Max 2... Well, we knew Max 2 was coming, but we didn't know Ultra Mix was coming.
5082225	5086468	We didn't know Ultramix 2 was coming, even though we knew Extreme was coming in 2004.
5087088	5090530	We don't know anything outside of DDR with Mario for right now.
5090630	5093432	We can rest assured we're going to see some new iterations.
5093512	5097815	I stake my career on it, as in quasi-internet celebrity.
5098435	5099235	Ooh, okay.
5100016	5100916	You heard it here first.
5101897	5105899	If you don't see any new PS2 or Xbox games, I will retire forever.
5106940	5108441	Wow, that's some strong words there.
5109346	5111687	You better hope I lose this archive if that does turn out to be true.
5111727	5112868	No, I am actually with you.
5113248	5120851	I'm not going to stake my internet celebrity on it because I don't have much to wager, but I do think we are going to see new PS2 and Xbox Mrs. I think it's inevitable.
5120871	5124633	Well, I don't have much to wager either, but there are people that want to see me retire, I'm sure.
5125433	5127254	Your website, El Mullet.
5127354	5128695	InsidePulse.com.
5129555	5129955	Visit it.
5130015	5130215	Love it.
5130235	5131456	You haven't had a new column in a while.
5132443	5133103	That's true.
5133483	5134704	School's been getting in the way.
5134744	5136224	I've been taking on some new duties.
5136304	5144087	I'm the news editor now, which means I have full control over the news board, which is why our news board is so kick-ass right now.
5145267	5148388	And I might be coming into some more... I've actually been working on a feature.
5149228	5152069	And believe it or not, it's an In the Groove related feature.
5152870	5153270	Shock!
5155570	5160252	I'm very curious to see what happens, because I know your feelings on In the Groove, and I'm just kind of...
5161196	5168981	My feelings aside, this is more of a quasi-promotional piece, let's say, because I got an interview with someone in Red Octane.
5169021	5171642	They were nice enough to answer some questions I had.
5172943	5176425	And I'm doing an official ignition pad review.
5176485	5184449	They were nice enough to supply me with a pad, considering that's going to be the basic controller they're offering for this game.
5184789	5185770	So how does it hold up?
5187098	5187439	We'll see.
5187479	5190861	We'll have to check that out when the article comes out.
5190901	5192983	So keep an eye on InsidePulse.com.
5193403	5199688	It should be out sometime this week if everything goes well, everything's on time and such.
5199888	5200148	All right.
5200188	5202790	Well, Mullen, I'm going to let you go so I can take another call, but thanks so much for calling in.
5202830	5203470	Have a good one, okay?
5203771	5204191	No problem.
5204211	5204491	You too.
5204611	5204811	Later.
5206893	5207073	Yes?
5207594	5212397	You know, I always expect El Mullen to come in with a guitar strum like El Cabong's.
5212617	5212897	Hold on.
5212917	5214899	We're going to go to another call here.
5214939	5216220	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5217096	5217817	We'll see.
5217877	5219218	We'll have to check that out.
5219538	5221079	Oh, turn down your volume there.
5221159	5224522	First rule of radio, turn down the volume because we're hearing ourselves there.
5225663	5226084	Hello.
5226964	5227285	Are you there?
5232727	5233728	Can't hear him.
5233888	5236390	I can hear myself, though, and I must say I sound sexy.
5237692	5238793	You got to check your mic, buddy.
5238813	5239393	We can't hear you.
5239413	5239853	Sorry.
5240434	5241215	Sorry, my friend.
5241315	5242035	Sorry, sorry, sorry.
5242196	5244418	Oops, I just hung up on somebody else.
5244458	5245338	I meant to hang up on that one.
5247901	5248481	Is somebody there?
5248881	5249322	Oh, we got him.
5249342	5249642	Hi.
5249802	5250463	You're on Orange Sounds Radio.
5250868	5256092	This is RPGKing7, coming to you from Canada Oh, Canada, what's that about?
5256292	5260315	Oh, not much, you know, weather's been really nice Alright, what's on your mind?
5260896	5265559	For this time of year What's on your mind, buddy?
5268701	5269002	Hello?
5269822	5270363	Did we lose him?
5271564	5273865	Sorry, I gotta keep the mic turned down Okay
5275299	5279262	No real news or anything, you know, I'm a bit new to this.
5280083	5285047	Well, not to DDR, I've been doing DDR for a year and a half, two years now.
5285387	5289210	Just want to thank you guys for doing the show, it's really awesome.
5289470	5290131	Oh, no problem, thank you.
5290151	5292093	I thought you guys, I'd have nothing to do on Sunday night.
5292753	5296656	Well, there's always Desperate Housewives, but it kind of sucks.
5298478	5300119	Do you get Desperate Housewives in Canada?
5300379	5300900	I hope you don't.
5302301	5304102	Nothing else I can really think of.
5304543	5307285	You guys are quite awesome.
5307785	5309807	Just keep up with us and good luck with the move and everything.
5310047	5311248	Alright, no problem.
5311268	5312489	Thank you for calling in.
5313329	5315111	Thanks for being a cool listener.
5315231	5317232	Yes, we like compliments and inflate our ego.
5317412	5320235	By the way, Rob, I love the fact how you're waving goodbye.
5320255	5321736	Thanks, I'll sign off now.
5321756	5322616	Keep going with it.
5322716	5323377	Alright, later.
5324438	5326259	Wow, I think he couldn't hear us.
5326419	5327400	We're big in Canada.
5328061	5329862	Alright, yeah, it's nice to know we're big in Canada.
5329902	5331243	We have an international following.
5332461	5334161	I need to visit Canada again.
5334201	5335602	It's been a little while since I've been to Canada.
5335762	5336582	I'd like to go back and visit.
5336602	5338243	Alright, let's go to another call.
5338283	5339183	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
5339743	5341823	Just so you know, Sky, you have a great voice.
5341924	5342344	I love it.
5342464	5343264	Oh, thank you.
5343344	5344044	That's so nice.
5345805	5347005	You don't think it's too faggy?
5347245	5348305	You don't think it's too faggy?
5349045	5351466	Because a lot of people say I'm too faggy.
5352966	5354387	Nah, I don't think so.
5354467	5354767	Alright.
5355347	5356607	It's just the way I am, dammit.
5357468	5358748	So what if I'm a little nasally?
5360051	5360891	We love you for it.
5360932	5361532	That's just it.
5361712	5362052	Thank you.
5362092	5362672	I appreciate it.
5363792	5366173	Sam Kinison got his career forever with that.
5368374	5369855	Who was one of my favorite comedians?
5371215	5371955	That explains it there.
5372315	5372956	What's on your mind, buddy?
5373576	5374036	Not much.
5374116	5375496	I got a couple of stories for you.
5376257	5377777	I know I told Jamie this one.
5378197	5380438	I call it the PSP to hell.
5383459	5386380	What happened was a guy came to return on the PSP.
5387901	5389041	This is brilliant.
5390208	5390388	Uh oh.
5418570	5421451	The screen was cracked into pieces.
5425813	5426113	Ouch.
5426934	5429595	Now I've heard about a couple burnt out pixels or two.
5429755	5430495	Stupid.
5431496	5432956	Stupid, stupid, stupid.
5433076	5433997	So what ended up happening?
5434857	5437598	General Manager told him, can I give you a refund now?
5437778	5439439	And he took a swing at the General Manager.
5440700	5442600	Oh, I hope you had that boy escorted out.
5443861	5444701	By the police, yeah.
5445081	5445722	By the police.
5446960	5451521	But what happened was the general manager ducked and hit him right in the face and he went out.
5452862	5453762	Oh my gosh.
5454502	5456243	Drama at a game store.
5456303	5457063	What the heck?
5458424	5463005	Best part is, the general manager was a six foot two tall girl.
5464746	5465846	That is awesome.
5465926	5466526	Wait a minute.
5466566	5471068	So this guy went to take a swing at a girl over a PSP which he broke himself.
5471648	5471888	Yes.
5472668	5474229	Stupid, stupid, stupid.
5474329	5474709	Huh.
5477199	5477879	Interesting.
5477959	5479300	Let us know when he's out of jail, okay?
5480280	5481960	Well, yeah, I'll be sure of that.
5482480	5486321	If we can get his picture, we'll post it on the website as our loser of the month.
5487262	5487862	I'll try.
5488202	5488542	Okay.
5489442	5490242	All right, sounds good.
5490582	5491883	Thank you so much for the call and the story.
5491903	5492623	Anything else on your mind?
5493223	5493563	Not really.
5493583	5495644	I'm just watching a backlash of drama and shit.
5495684	5496604	I'll just leave it at that.
5497244	5497544	Okay.
5497664	5498264	All right, have fun.
5498844	5499144	You too.
5499224	5499605	Take care.
5499725	5500245	Later, you too.

5596910	5597150	Hey.
5597430	5597830	Hey, what's up?
5598650	5599951	Ah, it's about damn time.
5600151	5601331	I know, it's crazy.
5601851	5603932	I apologize to those of you guys not getting through tonight.
5603972	5604893	It's lit up like hell.
5605653	5606933	It's my fault as well.
5606953	5609434	It's my fault too because, you know, I got a little bit late.
5610495	5611075	You lucked out.
5611095	5612516	The last guy didn't have his mic up.
5612556	5614116	What's on your mind, buddy?
5614637	5619879	Yeah, just helping you out with some Happy Sky song lists that are in Japanese.
5620479	5620799	All right.
5621283	5622984	I'm gonna tell it, you know, tell it to you.
5623104	5623865	And here it is.
5624085	5627828	The genre is disco, and the artist is a dance man featuring disco.
5628229	5629730	And this is kind of a tongue twister.
5630190	5633212	The tongue twister is, we are Disco Yotsutatsu Inochi.
5634794	5635114	Wow.
5635794	5636615	That's a mouthful there.
5636995	5638657	By the way, your mic is a little bit quiet.
5638697	5640979	Anything you can do to make yourself louder would be appreciated by our listeners.
5641719	5642820	Alright, now it's closer.
5642880	5643320	There you go.
5645217	5649320	I am beat mania, you are what mania?
5649620	5652543	Ore is a masculine way of saying I. Huh.
5673169	5674931	I am Beatmania, you are what mania?
5675652	5676573	You are what mania?
5677814	5681158	I am Beatmania, you are what?
5681218	5681799	No, you didn't.
5682359	5683180	I am Beatmania.
5684161	5685463	Sorry, couldn't help myself.
5688406	5693351	And then there's a hard dance, you know, which is a remix of Got Ticey or Strong Yega.
5694192	5694673	Ooh, okay.
5696141	5714510	and then there's, you know, and then a synthetic, oh, I forgot another, the genre is natural sound and it's by Twin Amadeus, Altaturka on Passion, you know, WN, I cannot pronounce it as UN, and it's very interesting that Altaturka on Passion is the remix of the Turkish March.
5715548	5716108	Oh, okay.
5716128	5718529	Yeah, the twin armadillos version of the Turkish March.
5718589	5720410	Ooh, that should be interesting, the old classic song.
5720950	5723451	Now, you've been checking out some of the videos, right, from Happy Sky?
5723911	5724131	Yeah.
5724231	5725491	In fact, I'm going to play a little clip.
5725511	5729873	You actually sent me one of Eden, one of the new songs from 12th Cell.
5729933	5731913	It's my very favorite Terra song.
5731933	5737175	So you can hear a little bit there of what Eden sounds like, the new Terra song.
5741797	5742957	Lots of double notes in that.
5748530	5750731	What else can we look forward to in the Happy Sky videos?
5750751	5753712	What else is in those videos that you think is worth sharing with our listeners?
5753732	5755492	Well, you already saw ToeJam.
5755732	5756992	Yeah, I saw the ToeJam video.
5757012	5757633	That was pretty cool.
5758153	5759693	Yeah, I really like the song.
5759733	5760914	It's the first time I ever heard it.
5761794	5767455	You know, while I was listening to the song, I just yelled, Yeehaw!
5773617	5774938	This is coming from the video there.
5774958	5775018	Yep.
5777088	5781770	Of course, tempo changes like hell, but that's what you'd expect from ToeJam.
5781950	5785731	It goes from 103 to 160 BPM.
5786672	5790013	Yeah, the 160 BPM is the fastest.
5790613	5790913	Alright.
5791574	5794115	Anything else in the videos that looks pretty cool?
5794135	5798016	Well, there's, whatchamacallit... Yeah, I didn't like the song, It's too plain.
5803593	5806415	I noticed it looks like a lot of the videos have generics.
5806575	5808496	I'm hoping that changes before the final release.
5808836	5812718	They will have actual videos when the final product's been released.
5813198	5814999	Just like the same thing happened to Be Quiet.
5815699	5816339	That's very true.
5816359	5820602	Alright.
5821690	5825871	Okay, well, we're going to go ahead and let you go because our Skype line is on fire tonight, but thanks for the 2DX update.
5826011	5833032	And the borrowing of your Japanese accent is always appreciated as well from this very white host.
5833872	5837773	And so, let me get my catchphrase first.
5838273	5842674	And so this resident 2DX bastard walks back to the shadows of Bimani style.
5843214	5843974	Thank you, my friend.
5844054	5844534	Have a good one.
5845034	5845694	All right, later.
5847014	5849135	I like our callers that have their own taglines.
5849175	5849735	That's pretty funny.
5850120	5853243	Alright, maybe we can squeeze in one more call.
5853603	5854544	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
5858347	5860108	It's this guy whose mic wasn't working earlier.
5860148	5861329	Can you hear us, buddy?
5862030	5862450	Hello?
5864452	5865233	I know we still can't hear him.
5865253	5866033	We still can't hear you.
5866114	5867575	Turn your mic up or something.
5869116	5870077	Give him a few more seconds.
5872859	5873159	Don't!
5873980	5874721	Let's try another call.
5876122	5877243	Alright, hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
5877263	5877363	Hello?
5878240	5879841	Hey, it's me, it's LemonLimeJump.
5879921	5881221	Hello, LemonLimeJump, how are you?
5882261	5884902	Hey, I'm, uh, uh, yeah, I'm here.
5885962	5887423	I don't know if there, is that better?
5887823	5888903	Yes, we can hear you, what's up?
5889123	5891244	Okay, um, alright.
5892044	5896186	I just wanted to say, yeah, I don't know why, but for some reason I was up early enough yesterday.
5896206	5896506	Hello?
5896966	5897566	Hi, we can hear you.
5898406	5902448	Oh, okay, um... We're just eagerly anticipating your every word.
5902968	5903828	Oh, okay, I'm just...
5904386	5905586	I need to turn off the radio.
5905767	5906127	Oh, okay.
5906147	5908788	Yeah, definitely turn down the radio because it'll throw you off there a little bit.
5909148	5909588	I've got it.
5910128	5910528	All right.
5912809	5921632	So I was actually tuned into the Today Show yesterday, and I guess you probably heard they had that DDR thing on it yesterday.
5921672	5923413	It was just like a little five-minute segment.
5923593	5925734	No, I actually didn't hear about DDR on the Today Show.
5926014	5926474	What happened?
5926494	5933677	Yeah, I guess they were touting it for its fitness qualities.
5934468	5937329	They had some fitness expert come in and try to show it off.
5937389	5942750	I think they had a couple of Cobalt Flux pads plugged into a PS2 or an Xbox or something.
5943710	5954672	And the thing I found... Okay, one thing I found interesting was that the song that they used for demonstration was Mobile Moga.
5954772	5958012	And I was thinking, Orange Lounge, Orange Lounge, where you going?
5958132	5958933	Oh, that's too cute.
5959933	5960193	And then...
5961829	5962869	Yeah, my brain works funny.
5963029	5963569	I don't know why.
5964950	5965790	I have to interrupt real fast.
5965810	5968151	Shark Skrull has got this funny look on her face.
5968191	5969011	You have to share this.
5969471	5971292	Oh my god, I think you're my voice twin.
5972992	5975173	Shark Skrull and Lemon Lime Jump do sound very similar.
5975213	5975933	It's kind of scary.
5976193	5978073	Same mannerisms, same voice, same everything.
5978113	5978654	It's freaky.
5980374	5982055	Everybody says I sound like my sister, though.
5982775	5986176	Except I don't... Well, now there's three of you.
5986416	5988716	Because you've got a twin on the West Coast.
5988856	5991077	Actually, there's five, because my family sounds like me, too.
5991878	5993018	Wow, that's crazy.
5993119	5993419	Wow.
5993999	5998260	I'm sorry, you were into another thought there before I let Sharks Girl cut you off there?
5999081	6000481	That's right.
6001302	6006564	But it was one thing that irritated me, and I guess, I don't know, because they needed something for the cameras to focus on.
6006924	6011966	Anyway, they demonstrated for like 30 seconds trying to play, and then they had the two guys...
6013482	6023005	Talking, and they still had the camera focused and they weren't even playing anymore, so it basically had the camera going boo, or the camera focused on the two TV screens going boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.
6023305	6024906	You too can be a DDR expert!
6027147	6030628	And I'm thinking, what choice of camera shots was that?
6030908	6031648	I'm not quite sure.
6031708	6033049	You know what I say to that director?
6033729	6034129	FIRED!
6036630	6038811	Yeah, it's a little, yeah.
6045117	6048219	Thanks for the update because I had no idea that DDR was on the Today Show.
6048259	6049520	I somehow completely missed that.
6049580	6053063	I wish that somebody would send a little clip somehow so we could see that.
6054033	6057015	Well, hopefully that somebody got that and we can check that out later.
6057335	6063139	And of course, if we can find a clip of the Today Show, we will do, in the great Orange Lounge tradition, we will play it and make fun of it.
6064761	6065741	Drew Kucky?
6067503	6070044	Hopefully not in the Today Show, but we'll see.
6070204	6070625	You never know.
6071165	6072126	They are desperate for ratings.
6072746	6074247	It just made me think of, yeah, NBC.
6074367	6075828	I know, I know.
6076789	6079751	Also, this is, yeah, your last show in the studio.
6079771	6083114	I'm not quite sure how the broadcasting works, but...
6087454	6095960	I don't know if I'd be broadcasting a show on my birthday, but I just want to say two days ahead of time, I want to say happy birthday to DarkSakura.
6096501	6097421	We got the same birthday.
6098382	6099162	Do you guys really?
6099703	6100844	Yeah, I looked it up.
6101044	6105607	You and DarkSakura and LemonLimeJump have the same birthday, and she's saying happy birthday to you.
6105627	6106668	Happy birthday to us!
6107749	6110170	Because we are so freaking awesome.
6110571	6111091	Happy birthday!
6114383	6114703	You're on.
6114803	6115083	Yay.
6115183	6115303	Oh.
6115944	6117504	From my left hand, I turned off the microphone.
6117584	6117744	No.
6118584	6119665	Arigato.
6121485	6122025	All right.
6122105	6123406	Well, you girls have a good birthday.
6123666	6128427	I'm imagining DarkSakura is the lushier of the two of you, so you probably won't be drinking.
6129028	6131889	I'm going to be boozing like a... Are you a big drinker, LemonLimeJump?
6133289	6133829	Not yet.
6133949	6135650	Give me about three years and two days.
6136070	6137770	Oh, she's underage.
6138251	6138831	My bad.
6138851	6139411	She's underage.
6139431	6142152	When you're 21, we're going to have to go hunt you down.
6142572	6142752	I've...
6144443	6145204	No, I'm good with it.
6145584	6146625	I've got a good composure.
6146725	6147766	This stuff doesn't bother me.
6148927	6150468	You hear worse on cable TV anyway.
6150488	6154812	I mean, not the cursing, but like... Okay, never mind.
6154832	6155592	I'm just taking a bigger hold.
6155632	6156253	Okay, it's alright.
6156273	6156633	It's alright.
6157314	6162037	Yeah, it's all about Loki's pants.
6163439	6169303	For a couple last words I wanted to say, I just wanted a few last words to say.
6169704	6169984	Of course.
6171025	6171305	Okay.
6171325	6171405	Okay.
6172577	6186921	Legs, clothing, baggies, bell bottoms, bells, bermudas, bloomers, boxer shorts, breeches, beefs, britches, chaps, chinos, clam jiggers, cords, corduroys, zenims, drawers, stone grease, jeans, jodipers, knickers, longies, overalls, pantaloons, panties, pedal pushers, pegs, shorts, slacks, trousers, and underpants.
6187442	6187902	And now you know.
6189246	6189767	They're pants.
6191828	6194731	Mel had a confused look on his face.
6194771	6196713	He's got one of those looks like he's mid-eating.
6196773	6198314	He's about to shove some cake in his mouth.
6198715	6199976	And then he's like, huh?
6200416	6201617	What is this chick saying?
6201958	6203039	I'm like, it's pants, Mel.
6203079	6203419	It's pants.
6204180	6205741	Thank you for sharing.
6205821	6208083	I think I'm done with pants for the night.
6208404	6209685	Good evening to you all.
6209745	6210766	Thanks for calling in, hon.
6211286	6211767	Have a good one.
6213869	6214730	Our listeners are so funny.
6216138	6218419	Maybe we can let one more call sneak in here.
6218479	6219819	I'm liking the sky plane tonight.
6219839	6220599	Everybody's getting in.
6222379	6223960	So we'll see if anybody else gets in.
6224020	6229741	Again, one more time, please take a second, vote for our podcast.
6229781	6231381	We would totally appreciate that.
6231421	6233121	It's podcastalley.com.
6233981	6235482	And then just do a search for Orange Lounge.
6235562	6238642	Or better yet, I'll just post the link right there in the chat room and you guys can vote.
6238922	6239402	How's that sound?
6239723	6240963	All right, let's go ahead and take this call.
6241483	6242303	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
6243584	6248306	Hey, what do you call a binary star system that distributes energy from one star into the other?
6248826	6249006	What?
6249026	6249426	Algal.
6249846	6251767	It's John Fields, your fan.
6252227	6253008	What's on your mind?
6253988	6260150	Well, I was thinking about the upcoming E3, and, you know, it's been quite a while since we've been hit with an arcade release of DDR.
6261011	6263612	So I'm wondering if they might actually spring that on us.
6264352	6270954	So John thinks that a possible arcade release could be something that would be shown at E3.
6270974	6271014	Um...
6273476	6278404	I would have to say, unfortunately, it's very doubtful because E3 is typically a consumer electronic show.
6278564	6283972	A new arcade mix would be something more for something like, what's the big arcade show they do in Vegas every year?
6284313	6285474	Coin-Op, something?
6289119	6291760	CES, Consumer Electronics Show, but they show arcade games there.
6291780	6292420	That makes no sense.
6292720	6301383	Alright, well, okay, but I did once, though, it's not unheard of, because I did see last year, and Amira was showing off, of all people.
6301463	6303584	It wasn't a pump-it-up game, but they were showing off an arcade game.
6303604	6304404	That game was cool.
6304424	6306564	That Korean tank, was it a tank game?
6306584	6307365	It was a shooting game.
6307425	6308305	It was like a shooting game?
6308465	6312106	And you had your controls on your gun, and then you had your fire buttons on your gun.
6312506	6314987	So I'm not going to say can't happen.
6315487	6317769	But very, very unlikely.
6317829	6319070	But boy, wouldn't that be nice.
6319291	6320311	Yeah, it would.
6322553	6330260	I guess also, since I am going to plug this anytime I can, I'll give you a little more information on Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst.
6330480	6331301	Okay, sure, why not?
6332482	6335505	This game has been confirmed for the USA and Europe now.
6337005	6341349	I heard about the new, there was like a Phantasy Star Universe that was coming, but that's a different thing, right?
6341870	6344433	Yeah, that is actually the next incarnation of the game.
6344553	6349058	Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst is basically the next Phantasy Star Online.
6349198	6354444	It's going to have Episode 4 and all that sort of stuff on it, plus a bunch of new chat options.
6355025	6356467	And it's slated for a June 2005 release.
6357972	6358392	Very cool.
6358432	6359192	I'm looking forward to it.
6359432	6360533	I do like Fancy Star.
6361073	6362473	I'm glad to see they're still sticking with it.
6363133	6363374	Yep.
6364154	6366214	Yuji Naka is not going to let this thing die.
6366494	6366774	Good.
6367855	6368435	Don't let it die.
6369875	6370696	I'll talk to you later.
6370716	6370896	All right.
6370916	6371496	Have a good one, buddy.
6371976	6372216	All right.
6372296	6372576	Later.
6373636	6374036	All right.
6374116	6382279	Boy, we should... I feel bad because there's still people trying to get in, but I'm like, we kind of need to move on.
6383679	6384219	Why don't we do this?
6384359	6384539	Huh?
6385380	6385720	One more?
6385900	6386680	Okay, one more.
6387230	6387891	One more call.
6389572	6392013	We're going to do one more call, so please hurry up, get in.
6393214	6399178	www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on Interact With Us, and you can get in on the Skype line.
6399259	6406384	Skype is a program that you download, and it allows you to call our show so that we don't have to shell out the money for an 800 number because we don't really want to do that.
6409426	6412808	What's interesting is that in the next studio, we're not going to have a landline.
6413989	6415850	Anyway, let's go to one more call.
6415910	6416891	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
6421479	6422760	Hello, can you hear us?
6424861	6425922	I heard a little fart noise.
6426062	6426962	That was about it.
6428543	6430624	Hello, everybody.
6432225	6433766	This is Stan Peel.
6435147	6435988	How are you?
6438629	6439290	Hello.
6441511	6442351	Can you hear me?
6442611	6443432	Yes, I can.
6444372	6445533	I can hear myself, too.
6447034	6448435	It's me, Stan Peel.
6448475	6450036	How are you doing, everybody?
6455260	6458380	I just gotta say, I love this DDR stuff, man.
6458780	6460541	It's great for picking up the youngins.
6462961	6465381	Is that what you wanted to call in tonight?
6465902	6468562	Turn down the audio because we're hearing ourselves.
6471363	6472583	I love that DDR.
6472603	6473443	Can you hear me now?
6473563	6474263	Yeah, I can hear you.
6474623	6475503	But I can hear myself.
6475603	6476203	That's the problem.
6477764	6479564	Oh no, you shouldn't be able to hear yourself.
6481206	6481786	That's bad.
6481906	6483808	You hear yourself, that means you're talking in your head.
6488090	6488490	It's me.
6488590	6489251	I'm back, man.
6489271	6490171	I love that DDR.
6490191	6491892	It's great for picking up the young ones.
6497476	6502218	Are you related to Michael Jackson?
6502238	6507482	Well, that's not very nice to say.
6507962	6509823	How dare you insult me like that?
6511843	6512844	Call me a pedophile.
6512864	6513844	I'm not a pedophile.
6513924	6516185	I'm just a connoisseur of the young flesh.
6522488	6525210	Why are you calling in to the show?
6526430	6527411	Why am I calling in?
6527431	6528932	I'll tell you why I'm calling in.
6529872	6531913	I like to say hello.
6532373	6535555	Congratulations to Orange Lounge Radio.
6535575	6539717	Because you guys are doing a wonderful service.
6542110	6542550	Well, thank you.
6542570	6543251	We appreciate it.
6545432	6549375	You make it easy for us to pick up on the onions.
6550076	6552618	Are you in our chat room right now picking up on the onions again?
6553859	6556681	Who says I'm in your chat room?
6558742	6560223	Well, I was going to invite you in.
6560283	6562305	Just head on over to OrangeLinesRadio.com.
6564614	6566796	You don't know who's in there.
6567516	6572560	I could be standing right next to you in the chat room looking at you going, that's your precious young thing.
6577423	6578524	I'm speechless.
6581085	6582266	Well, that's a first.
6585208	6587590	Hey-oh, Rob is speechless, everybody.
6590956	6592737	Is that wonderful Jamie there?
6593177	6594018	Yes, Jamie's here.
6594478	6598100	Jamie, Sam wants to talk to you.
6598500	6601682	I have Crayola sketches of your boobies.
6604623	6607564	I like using the peach because it's realistic.
6615048	6616569	Uh-oh, I got company.
6619181	6620442	I got somebody here with me.
6620722	6621143	I'm Ms.
6621183	6621623	Cleo.
6622144	6622864	Oh, hello.
6624586	6625747	Hello, how are you today?
6625987	6626648	Oh, I'm good.
6626708	6627368	How are you?
6628569	6629430	I'm hearing things.
6629510	6629931	Are you?
6632453	6633114	How's Ms.
6633134	6633514	Cleo doing?
6633534	6633974	Pardon me?
6640492	6641753	Does Riz Khalil play DDR?
6641813	6648318	I'm hearing an echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo.
6651180	6652021	Give me a minute.
6652081	6653482	Let me try something here.
6653922	6658185	I think having two phones connected together is kind of screwing it all up.
6663849	6666271	Jeez, Rob, don't cry till you pee your pants.
6667873	6669514	I'll leave that to you, Stan.
6669854	6671475	You sound like you're getting a little there.
6671555	6673155	You might be getting to that point.
6676217	6677837	Jesus, you sound like a freaking harpy.
6677857	6679118	What the hell is going on?
6680038	6680899	I don't know, Stan.
6680939	6682179	It's your fault.
6684140	6685081	Pardon me?
6688242	6691023	My god, things have all gone kooky-kooky-dooky.
6695425	6696085	Oh, there we go.
6696566	6697306	Oh, no, that didn't work.
6700087	6707952	Stan, before this echo kills us all, any final words you want to say on this call?
6709813	6712335	Well, well, well, God, I can't even do that for real.
6712355	6713076	That's just freaky.
6714877	6722502	All I got to say is to all you youngins playing DDR, hello, there we are, just remember one thing.
6723911	6728472	You don't know who's watching behind you.
6728572	6730513	Thank you, Stan.
6730733	6731833	Peace out, everybody.
6732073	6732954	Peace out, Stan.
6736595	6738455	I had to send my ninjas after that picture.
6739335	6739795	Wow.
6743136	6744957	Did I suggest taking one more call?
6744997	6745537	I'm sorry.
6745577	6747618	Yeah, that was you that said take one more call.
6747758	6749498	I was ready to move on to the next segment.
6756889	6783759	Crayola sketches of your boobies DarkSakura you know what and right there hey fellow broadcasters and VIPs listening tonight there's your consideration clip for most unlikely to hear on AM FM radio thank you this has been an Orange Lounge presentation oh hell
6784284	6786826	Alright, we're going to close the Skype line for now, but we will come back later.
6787166	6792671	I was going to go to another break, but we're actually kind of starting to run behind in show, so I think we ought to just go into the next segment, which is kind of weird.
6793752	6798076	But we're going to go into the Orange Lounge Cage Match, because we need a break, because my face hurts from laughing.
6798636	6799156	Seriously.
6799637	6802279	And some of our folks in our chat room are saying that too, that they haven't laughed.
6802299	6804401	Do you need pants for your face so you can be a butthead?
6806583	6807163	Listen, you.
6809605	6810246	Alright, um...
6814324	6815925	I'm sorry to those of you guys that didn't get through.
6816806	6824690	We will open up the Skype line at the end of the show if we have more time, which I'm thinking we will, if we can go ahead and move on to our next segment, which is the Cage Match.
6824810	6837218	Alright, in tonight's Cage Match... We have a very interesting scenario in tonight's Cage Match, because we have a song going for a five-week victory tonight.
6838012	6840374	I tried coming in last week.
6858801	6859641	Thanks for watching!
6874827	6877649	All right, so, again, a reminder of the way the cage match works.
6877929	6879410	We play three songs for you guys.
6879570	6881151	Last week's winner and two new songs.
6881171	6884253	We play a clip of last week's winner, two new songs in their entirety.
6884313	6889697	You guys vote for your favorites, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio.
6890097	6893259	Doesn't have to be a Bomani song, doesn't have to have anything to do with Bomani.
6893499	6895601	They're just songs that we think are cool.
6896001	6897102	But, you know what?
6897162	6900704	This cage match, we do have a way of setting trends, because may I remind you...
6901463	6905084	What songs have we played in the cage match previously that went on to win?
6906025	6912247	Lava, Wherever You Are, Delirium, After All, Jason Nevins, I'm In Heaven With You.
6912767	6914148	Where did all these songs end up?
6914588	6919490	Hmm, DDR, so you never know what might come of the Orange Lounge Radio cage match.
6919530	6923692	So here it is going for its very, maybe, last win and retirement.
6923992	6926473	Yoko Kanno, song number one with Rise.
6926633	6926933	Enjoy.
6957839	6958260	S, Actdeft,
6999518	7000282	Thanks for watching!
7038522	7055098	I want to stand in this waking hell I am With nothing more than I can confuse Pray myself please don't forget Life betrayed and the oppressed Please give me the strength to be at home
7090248	7094171	Alright, that was a clip of song number one, Yoko Kanno, Rise.
7094311	7099815	Possibly the third song in Orange Lounge history to be retired tonight, but it's gotta be two competitors.
7100275	7104698	It has to win, just like every other cage match retiree has done four weeks in a row.
7105158	7111963	Alright, so the first competitor tonight is my choice, and I'm choosing somebody with kind of a college spin.
7112303	7113204	I'm choosing Beck.
7113877	7125261	There's a reason why I'm choosing Beck tonight, because Beck's latest EP, he actually did all these 8-bit style remixes of songs from his latest album.
7125561	7129442	And some of it is just way too cool, I had to put one in the cage match.
7129742	7138666	So here it is, song number two, this is Beck with a song called Ghetto Chip Malfunction, and it's actually a song called Hell Yes, remixed by 8-Bit.
7138966	7139826	Enjoy, song number two.
7144866	7145167	Yes.
7153306	7179938	Looking for my place on the summary lines, fake prizes rising out of the bomb holes Skeleton boys hyped up and purple, smoke rings come from across the disco Banknotes burn like broken equipment, looking for shelter, readjust your position Thought control goes with a confession, two dimensions Dumb your head down, duck, don't look now Company missiles, powers rot, you and the cops are watching Make your dreams out of paper mache
7180458	7207315	Cliché, wasted, hate taste, that's hell Hell yes, now I'm moving this way, I'm doing this thing Hell yes, now I'm turning it on, now I'm working my legs Hell yes, now I'm calling you out, I'm switching my plates Hell yes, now I'm cleaning the floor, my beat is correct Hell yes, yeah that's it, yeah that's it, yeah that's it
7209068	7209768	Yeah, that's it.
7224352	7250659	Pointless, fools anointed to the following stand fair Look for the common, not superficial Cold, red, cold, I woke up home in a crisis For fuck every idols, rewriting the bibles For magic, markers running out of the ink Lives in white out, turn the lights out Fact machine anthems, get your damn hands up Hell yes, now I'm moving this way, I'm doing this thing Hell yes, now I'm turning it on, I'm working my legs
7251992	7263265	Hell yes, now I'm calling you out, I'm switching my place Hell yes, now I'm clearing the floor, my beat is great Yes, yes, hi, hi, hi
7273234	7273834	Outro Music
7308584	7311465	Nevermind that guitar riff there, that accidentally went into the next song there.
7311745	7314866	That was song number two, Ghetto Chip Malfunction by Beck.
7314966	7316186	Let's see what everybody thought of that.
7316647	7317387	DarkSakura.
7318607	7319508	That was pretty cool.
7319608	7324649	It would give me a headache if I listened to it on repeat, which I would probably do.
7325409	7326470	So I give it a nine.
7326970	7328170	A very solid nine.
7328230	7333172	The EP actually has four songs on it, all in that same style, so it's kind of cool.
7333212	7336473	I've been listening to very diverse things lately, that's right up my alley, so yeah.
7336906	7337346	Very cool.
7337726	7339707	All right, let's see who's next.
7339727	7340487	Who else has got a mic?
7340507	7341167	Who's got a mic over there?
7341187	7341487	Jonas.
7341987	7342368	Let's see.
7342848	7344208	Orgasmic Nostalgia.
7344628	7345308	It's pretty good.
7345969	7346989	I like it.
7347189	7347509	A nine.
7347689	7348149	A nine.
7348449	7348729	All right.
7349229	7349730	Shark Skrull.
7351550	7353631	That was pretty nifty, and I don't normally like that.
7354251	7358472	So I think the remix part of it made it really kind of cool, and I liked the hell yes at the end.
7358512	7359352	I was like, oh, nifty.
7359892	7360092	So 9.3759.
7360513	7361813	Okay.
7361853	7362273	Islander.
7367924	7369944	Angel It's back, it's a 9
7396392	7398813	I actually don't typically care for Beck a whole lot.
7398853	7401834	I mean, he's okay, but again, the 8-bit thing does it for me.
7401934	7402394	I love it.
7402514	7403214	Please enjoy.
7403234	7403214	9.
7404235	7404535	All right.
7405255	7409536	Let's see if song number 3 is going to win tonight.
7409636	7411257	And song number 3 is Loki's pick.
7411357	7412877	Loki, what did you pick for us tonight?
7414798	7416158	My computer's down right now.
7416218	7416919	It's in pieces.
7417359	7419960	Please don't let it be Papa Smurf lick my ass.
7420520	7423401	I already submitted that one, so that doesn't work.
7424021	7424101	Ah.
7424600	7433547	No, um, this song, I had Jamie find me a song real quick, and that's right, folks.
7434107	7434848	It's girls!
7435328	7435849	Enjoy!
7613135	7614937	Thanks for watching!
7654321	7665323	Okay, so how appropriate that the last show at this studio will have Prodigy with Girls, the still shot mix this time in the cage match.
7665623	7667123	What did we think of the still shot mix?
7667483	7668123	DarkSakura?
7668303	7672144	It's a mix of that song that doesn't completely suck donkey ass.
7673044	7674965	Which is double ass if you think about it.
7676125	7676965	So it gets an 8.
7678765	7679045	Get it?
7679065	7679645	Donkey ass?
7679745	7680165	Ass ass?
7680986	7681986	8 from DarkSakura.
7682326	7682646	Jonas!
7685259	7686220	Sorry, I was trying to go in the same order.
7686660	7692305	I have to agree, the remix is very great, so... I like the big beat into it, so I'll give it a 9.
7692465	7694667	Alright, uh, Shark Skrull.
7695888	7698229	I'm feeling generous in that freaking own 10.
7698950	7699871	Ooh, Islander.
7701272	7702293	Don't I have a mouthful of cake?
7702313	7702593	I'll say 9.
7704735	7707217	Mel B. I was feeling that beat, man.
7707257	7713762	It's like a throwback to, like, the early 80s Afro-Bambada type, you know, hip-hop, like, old-school, like, breakbeat type stuff.
7714307	7716908	If I had more room here, I'd do a head spin, so I'd give it a nice 10.
7718289	7719310	Alright, Loki.
7720570	7724732	It gets a 9, and that belt gets a 10.
7728514	7730395	Alright, and you know what?
7730535	7734157	I hate to be the party pooper, but I was only feeling that song for about the first minute.
7734357	7736418	And once the vocals came in, it kind of lost me.
7736519	7737619	So I can only really give it like a 6.5.
7738540	7738780	Angel.
7739720	7741221	For the beat, I'd give it a 7.
7741401	7741681	Alright.
7742762	7743142	Alright.
7743894	7748098	Very tough decision tonight you guys, but here it is, the three songs you get to vote for.
7748558	7751460	Song number one, Yoko Kanno with Rise.
7753882	7755303	That's a bad clip, let me try another clip.
7763210	7767934	Alright, song number two you can vote for tonight is Beck with Ghetto Chip Malfunction.
7775560	7780561	And song number three you can vote for tonight is Prodigy with Girls, the Still Shot Mix.
7789203	7791384	All right, place, vote.
7798254	7799535	Sorry we had a bit of dead air there for a minute.
7799555	7799995	Sorry about that.
7800035	7801496	Place vote now.
7801576	7803997	You must be in the chat room to place your vote.
7804617	7807699	www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on chat.
7808579	7810380	Send a private message to Sky with your vote.
7810420	7811601	Song number one, Yoko Kanno.
7811661	7812561	Song number two, Beck.
7812641	7815323	Song number three, Prodigy.
7815563	7816123	My butt.
7816563	7817664	I mean, Prodigy.
7818144	7818404	Alright.
7820763	7829458	Now, Loki, I know you've had kind of a dramatic week and a lot of stuff going on, but you know I have to ask, this is the point of the show where I always want to know, what's going on in the sim scene?
7829898	7831681	Well, there's a few things, actually.
7833382	7836703	There was XX Mix came out.
7837083	7839583	It's another Japanese fan mix type thing.
7839783	7840323	It's kind of cool.
7840363	7842004	They've got some pretty interesting songs in there.
7842324	7847044	They have a really good remix of 501, a really shitty remix of Celebrate Night, so it kind of evens out.
7847625	7857546	You can find a link for that on Bomae Style under the wonderful Japanese fan mix, like food mix thread, and that's in there.
7857566	7860827	And then also there was, oh man, what the...
7861280	7863062	Siberia Style 2.5 came out.
7863082	7864544	That's also Step Mania skin.
7865324	7866686	Sort of resembles Techno Fiend.
7866726	7867326	It's pretty good.
7867607	7872712	I haven't really noticed any differences between the 2.5 and 2, but I downloaded it anyways.
7872752	7873213	It's pretty good.
7874394	7875275	That's pretty much it for now.
7876436	7877838	Oh, and DDRUK is back up.
7879179	7880480	But, eh, whatever.
7883907	7889491	Wow, this is tough because I'm trying to tally votes from tonight's cage match here, so somebody's got to help me fill time.
7890492	7892253	DarkSakura, tell them about some of the other features.
7892273	7893735	I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts.
7894375	7899519	Tell them about some of the lovely... What am I supposed to tell people about?
7899579	7901461	Some of the other lovely programming we have on Orange Laundry.
7901521	7903142	Oh yeah, we do other shows.
7903202	7905584	Do we still do Diversion on Monday?
7905925	7906345	Yes, we are.
7906725	7910048	Okay, there's Diversion on Monday, and it starts whenever the hell it feels like playing it.
7910861	7916323	And then on Tuesday, I do Pump Up the Volume, which is actually Gorilla's Marathon.
7916363	7916663	I'm sorry.
7917443	7922484	Which is actually whatever I feel like playing at the time, or whatever the chat room requests.
7922544	7928066	It's really supposed to be a request show, but no one ever requests anything except for really bizarre shit I don't have.
7929326	7931527	Although I do have a bunch of bizarre stuff.
7931827	7937109	Pre-show starts at a quarter to seven, the show starts at 7.30 to 10.30, or whenever the hell I feel like passing out.
7938269	7938369	Um...
7939238	7942660	This Tuesday, by the way, I will not be doing the show on Tuesday.
7943380	7944681	I will be doing it another night.
7945621	7947582	Because my ass is taking a night off on my birthday.
7947662	7948943	So, fuck that.
7950744	7956466	So, you can check our Orange Lounge Live Journal community for the information on when the show will be rescheduled for.
7956486	7958607	Eh, responsible bullshit.
7959408	7962389	Next up is Rob's show, Outside the Box.
7963029	7966231	Yes, but Outside the Box is actually on hiatus until the station relaunch in May.
7966391	7968352	So, it comes on eventually.
7968789	7969450	Yes, eventually.
7969470	7970590	You have to look forward to that.
7970770	7975694	Well, maybe we'll have to make some type of arrangement.
7975774	7978276	I will be doing my show just on a different night.
7979577	7980117	All right.
7981838	7984780	And then we do the repeat thingy.
7986262	7987542	On DDR Freak, actually.
7987562	7988183	That's indeed right.
7988203	7989264	I just wanted to make a mention.
7989284	7989604	Mm-hmm.
7990609	8003939	and we actually have a lot of people that listen over on DDR Freak and so as kind of a thank you to you guys over on DDR Freak for making us kind of a popular little spin-off over on DDR Freak Radio, we actually now are on same week rotation.
8004439	8010443	So because of the fact that we didn't have a show last week, we used it as a chance to clean the gap there on DDR Freak.
8010463	8015207	So now you are hearing, when you hear this show, this is the show that we did that same Sunday.
8015247	8016468	You don't have to wait a week anymore.
8016528	8018249	You're actually getting the show the same week we did it.
8018369	8019590	And you'll be hearing it
8021520	8025322	in like full MP3 Pro quality.
8025362	8026763	Yes, yes.
8026803	8030485	Because they have very good quality over there at DDR Freak Radio, so you get a good quality.
8030505	8034227	Yeah, I'd say it's a pretty nice operation run over there.
8034307	8034547	Yeah.
8035908	8038189	And then we have our new spin-off, Ferret Radio.
8039650	8049495	Actually, when we relaunch in May and kind of things take over again, we're going to be kind of looking for new talent to do some new shows, so...
8050670	8053731	Maybe we need to be doing Orange Lounge Idol.
8054431	8055591	Yeah, so we'll see what happens.
8056391	8063313	So if you want to be a part of the best of 2005 nominated Orange Lounge Radio, we're going to have opportunities coming up.
8063793	8065533	And it doesn't have to be about Bobani.
8066013	8069554	Anything gaming related in the slightest, we're going to take.
8069894	8071815	So we'll have more details on that coming soon.
8073275	8077736	And don't forget about the Kick the Ultracade photobomb.
8077756	8078656	Oh yes, we have that too.
8079275	8084857	Yes, we need more pictures of people kicking Ultracade machines because those bids are trying to steal the MAME.
8086817	8090238	I think some of that got settled and that's not happening, but it's still funny.
8090758	8098460	The fact that the dude tried and he was such a complete retard because MAME was already registered and already somebody else's invention.
8099020	8104362	So yeah, kick an Ultracade machine out of Love for Orange Lounge and send me the picture.
8105859	8106099	All right.
8106600	8106920	Sounds good.
8107160	8110243	And only one person has voted for us on Podcast Alley tonight.
8110463	8114606	So I hope that maybe some of the rest of you guys are just waiting on those email confirmations.
8115087	8116008	They won't spam you.
8116208	8120251	There is completely nothing to vote for us over on Podcast Alley.
8120291	8120792	Please do.
8121132	8121772	We'd appreciate it.
8123033	8123314	All right.
8123354	8123774	Let's hear it.
8123794	8125335	You guys want to hear tonight's winner, the cage match?
8125936	8126176	Sure.
8126316	8126596	All right.
8126797	8127797	Now, here's the interesting thing.
8128938	8132321	More votes tonight than any other cage match in Orange Lounge Radio history.
8132962	8133102	Ooh.
8133682	8141246	So this was now, and somebody in the chat room actually called me on it and said, Sky, you say it every week that the cage match is a hard one to decide.
8141546	8144347	Tonight definitely is the case because of so many votes.
8144768	8147069	More votes tonight than any other night.
8147449	8148329	What is the winner?
8152631	8155733	Yoko Okano goes into retirement with a
8156357	8156697	I'm in history.
8156717	8158119	Because they said suck, see?
8158139	8159039	Is that necessarily a good thing?
8180932	8182393	It deserves to be retired!
8205349	8209891	and yeah, DarkSakura has now had one song retired with Yoko Kanno with Rise.
8209951	8215174	So we've all had one song retired and so when we come back on May 1st
8216440	8217581	Cage Match starts over.
8217701	8218481	Cage Match starts new.
8218601	8220162	Three brand new songs are going to be in it.
8220222	8221163	So it'll be interesting.
8221383	8222784	We're going to have to change up the theme.
8223004	8223784	We'll have to do something.
8223804	8225285	We'll have to work on that over the next couple of weeks.
8225445	8226206	Change up the theme.
8226706	8234450	Oh, and by the way, since I made a mention of this to Rob and Loki earlier, I do want to actually give a shout out to some of our listeners.
8234751	8236572	Those who are some of our UK listeners.
8237452	8237632	Hi.
8238833	8239713	Yes, actually, I...
8241149	8241849	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
8259943	8261824	We've gotten some listeners in Japan, too.
8262144	8264825	Japan is actually one of our biggest country representations.
8264845	8266265	I believe our third most listened country.
8266506	8267866	I think number three behind U.S.
8267886	8268786	and Canada, actually.
8268967	8272668	I think England itself is actually number four.
8275589	8287954	I wanted to stop and make that mention to our listeners in non-United States countries, because even though we go off on everything happening over here, we're still thinking of you guys, so thank you for listening to us.
8288857	8289578	Thank you for watching!
8309662	8311083	So there's two choices we can do for that.
8311123	8318387	We can do A, the ultimate cage match with all the retired songs and choose a victor between all three of those retired songs.
8318547	8320548	Of course, then it wouldn't be a surprise what you're going to hear.
8321569	8329053	Or choice number two, and the chat room has been begging us to do this for about 70 weeks now, reverse cage match number two.
8329954	8330414	What do you think?
8332895	8337378	It would be good to end season four with the retirees.
8337518	8337718	Mm-hmm.
8338923	8340644	We have three retirees now, right?
8340684	8340864	Yep.
8344005	8345726	Why not do both?
8346206	8347787	Alright, we're going to do both next week.
8347827	8348827	So there'll be two cage matches.
8348847	8349667	Because we love you guys.
8349707	8352469	Double ultimate secret cage match.
8352489	8359531	So we'll do the retirees to end season four, and we'll do the reverse cage match to start season five.
8359711	8362072	Actually, this is season five that's ending right now.
8362112	8363193	Well, it's season six.
8363553	8365195	The Season of Satan!
8381936	8388298	In the last reverse cage match, which took place on episode 69... Oh my god, if anyone plays girls, I will kill you.
8389138	8394919	It was Complicated from DanceMania Speed 9 was banned from the station forever.
8395760	8399261	So the speed mix of Complicated was banned from the station forever.
8399601	8400321	We will not play it.
8400381	8404582	So, both coming back next week.
8404662	8406402	It's going to be a two cage match week.
8407343	8408583	Alright, so look for that.
8410839	8411219	All right.
8411619	8413821	I think we need to go to a break.
8415402	8416322	I need a break or something.
8416622	8417363	Yeah, we need a break.
8417383	8421385	When we come back, we're going to have the FUs of the week and maybe a couple more Skype calls.
8422425	8423206	Ask Orange Lounge.
8423346	8425027	We have to do one more of those in the studio.
8425507	8428149	And whatever else we think of.
8428309	8430310	So we'll be back after this.
8430870	8435072	In this break, what's a fun theme to do for this break?
8438154	8438374	Let's see.
8438394	8439515	I'm digging through the old songs.
8439912	8442414	Just play Maximizer three times in a row or something like that.
8442434	8444757	No, we're not going to do Max.
8445277	8449321	But we can do songs that start with M. Let's do that.
8449341	8453305	We're going to do songs that start with M. So we'll be back after this break.
8453726	8455247	Started off with some Matsuri Japan.
8455327	8456128	We'll be back after this.
8519631	8521038	Thanks for watching!
8577956	8578376	and many more.
8625268	8626513	Thank you for watching!
8653260	8654804	Thanks for watching!
8679589	8682210	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
8744754	8748677	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8790700	8794762	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8825248	8831452	Gaming Radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
8833933	8835274	Orange Lounge Radio.
8838676	8841617	Alright, we are back here with Orange Lounge Radio.
8842357	8848721	Currently, radio dedicated to all things Bomani and then some, but in two weeks, what gamers really want to know.
8849835	8853377	The live show here, what we've got going on in this three-hour program, it's not going to really change.
8853437	8858801	We still are going to be the source, the premier internet radio source for DDR and other music and rhythm game news.
8858821	8860542	We're not going to change what we're doing Sunday nights.
8860882	8869827	It's just the change is going to affect the podcast, which has kind of already happened if you listened to this week's episode, and it also is going to affect the rest of what you hear on the station.
8869847	8871908	We're going to be looking for new shows to kind of expand.
8872289	8876211	We want to be the video gaming internet radio station.
8876611	8877572	The station.
8878152	8880193	So we're kind of excited about it, so we're looking forward to it.
8881353	8884235	We are going to have the biggest adjective ever.
8885355	8888856	And we know that the only way we're going to achieve this is with your guys' help.
8889857	8891317	Because we have an awesome listening base.
8891517	8897780	There is no way in hell we would ever have been nominated for the Best in Life 365 Awards without our listening base and all these other things we do.
8898080	8899161	You guys rock.
8899561	8900161	Love you guys.
8901081	8901441	Kisses.
8901742	8902042	All right.
8902422	8907604	So, with that being said, let's go from the lovey-dovey chat to the angst and hatred.
8909102	8910924	chat that you guys have come to know and love.
8912765	8915168	And hopefully this won't be directed at the listeners tonight.
8916048	8917590	I think we might want to leave on a good note here.
8917670	8922755	So, DarkSakura, why is it that we always do these FUs of the week every single week?
8923035	8924176	Grr, argh.
8941974	8942955	Okay.
8943816	8948799	Big F you to people who drive 10 miles under the speed limit when I'm driving 20 over.
8952682	8959807	An F you to my driver's side window that keeps rolling down and the sap that fell all over my car windows in a sticky manner that has stayed put.
8960568	8963910	Little droplets all over my window.
8963930	8966472	F you to being...
8967324	8971387	Bored by just about everything since the semester is almost over.
8972248	8977092	School has gotten into the really boring yet really hectic phase where, Oh my god, I gotta get all this shit done!
8978033	8978293	You know.
8979434	8982817	Um, F you to my allergies and springtime in general.
8984578	8992124	And, uh, F you to, uh, living in my crappy apartment with my, uh, interesting neighbors.
8993205	8996948	And I mean, by interesting, I mean totally sucky.
9000521	9002421	No, my neighbors think they're all thug gangsters.
9004782	9005042	Yeah.
9008082	9011003	And I mean the really wannabe thinking they are.
9012003	9012983	The really annoying kind.
9014023	9019504	If they really were, I'd think, oh, well, that's kind of awesome, but no.
9019944	9022685	Yeah, and I want to go back to Alabama.
9022705	9024665	Because I need grit.
9026265	9026585	I'm done.
9028606	9029726	Alright, Loki!
9032389	9034991	Fuck you to moving, I hate moving.
9035351	9036752	Moving sucks.
9037452	9041435	Honestly, I mean, let's see, let's start off with people that drive slow.
9041975	9046838	Every single person, old person, person in a truck, always driving goddamn slow.
9046878	9051721	And I'm doing, honestly, I'm doing like the speed limit because I don't want to go crazy with my car and stuff.
9051741	9056743	Especially when I've got a ton of, you know, boxes in and stuff I can't see out the back window or anything like that.
9057364	9059365	So, you know, I've been doing pretty good, you know.
9059705	9061026	But these guys are going like...
9062363	9086310	20, and a goddamn 50, okay, stuff like that, it's so awful, um, then, also, the fact that I have just so much crap to pack, that just really sucks, fuck you to my apartment for having a air conditioning unit right next to the bedroom, um, that sounds like a jet engine, you know, firing up, um, in the middle of the night when some bastard upstairs wants his air,
9086866	9093868	I mean, it's not that hot outside, and you just fucking turn on the air conditioning and it's just all... Oh my god!
9094848	9095608	Jet engine!
9096569	9106611	Anyways, I can sleep through that because I can sleep through anything, but, you know, my, you know, fiancé cannot, and she, you know, didn't like that too much.
9108372	9114374	Also, fuck you to the fact that my car's check engine light came on.
9115114	9115514	Why...
9116195	9117255	Why now?
9117575	9120056	Especially now that moving costs money.
9121176	9123496	Fixing a car is not exactly on the agenda.
9124917	9126217	Things are pretty tight as it is.
9126537	9129538	Hope nothing majorly wrong is with my car.
9131138	9134919	If it's something really bad, I can take it to the dealership and they'll fix it.
9135859	9138799	Because I've got that extended warranty that, thank God, I bought.
9138819	9141660	I don't know, it's just...
9142099	9144641	We comprise our TV of solid lead and spent uranium
9171693	9175615	It's like, I don't understand why that TV's gotta be so damn heavy, but it is.
9176796	9178937	And then, um, let's see what else.
9180297	9187701	Oh, fuck you, the, um, mutated, ugly, um, bitch next door that, um, rented me my U-Haul truck because, um,
9188669	9191690	I rented it online, you know, I reserved a 14-foot truck.
9191710	9196791	I get there, I've been trying to call you, and I couldn't get a hold of you.
9197132	9200893	Well, I had, you know, I gave, you know, my work number and my home number.
9201153	9202673	I never heard a call over here.
9202853	9204174	Now I've been sitting here packing.
9204914	9208035	She's like, we don't have a 14-foot truck.
9208115	9209275	You don't have to take 10.
9209955	9211696	I'm like, okay, fine, I'll take the 10-foot truck.
9211976	9213476	Are you going to be driving at night?
9213756	9215477	Because they don't got one headlight.
9216181	9218922	I'm like, okay, fine, I'll take the GIMP truck.
9219462	9221723	So then I take the GIMP truck, drive it around.
9222083	9225585	The fucking, um, you know, everything's breaking on this thing.
9225605	9230787	It's like, oh my god, let's get this packed and done with, you know, before the truck falls apart.
9231067	9232168	We can get it back to her.
9232508	9235269	And honestly, we drove a total of seven miles.
9236302	9260754	7 miles, the gas gauge is full, it's still on full, we get there, you only drove 7 miles, you probably didn't even fill it up, I'm charging you $3 for gas, for 7 miles, I mean, granted, I understand, you know, this might be like an SUV, but, you know, I don't think I used $7 for the gas driving 7 miles, or, you know, $3 for the gas, whatever it is, I mean, shit,
9262262	9268226	Oh, and not to mention that the truck cost me, um, $19.99 to start off with, $1.19 a mile.
9268546	9280253	$7 for the goddamn dolly, and then $5 for convenience fee for on- What the fuck, I got charged $5 for convenience fee online, not to get the same truck I want, instead I get a gimp truck.
9280493	9281414	What the fuck is that?
9281634	9286016	Where's Jamie when you need her, because she would be yelling at you, she would be filing a complaint for you right now.
9287477	9288078	Here she comes!
9290629	9292330	Fuck you to the chair for eating the microphone.
9293530	9294211	Okay, what did I miss?
9294231	9295151	Because I was pulling my laundry.
9296072	9298033	Run by the bill again and why you got charged.
9298693	9303215	Anyways, so ugly, you know, inbred bitch next door.
9304115	9315901	She, oh, might I add, she, for anyone that's out there that's seen Men in Black, okay, you know there's a point in the movie where this evil alien thing takes over a human host body and kind of
9317034	9320537	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9343519	9350306	Talk to your manager, write the Better Business Bureau, send a copy of the letter CCA to her, CCA, you know, send it to the Better Business Bureau, and keep a damn copy.
9351307	9357132	That's why I love having her around, because she'll just, she'll tell you how to fuck with somebody.
9359114	9361236	I live to prove people wrong.
9362498	9366622	Oh, and then to top it off, at the very end of when I got done dealing with her,
9367469	9372537	Do you know I need high schoolers that might want to work here on the weekend with me?
9373018	9377486	I'm like, no one that I would want to subject you to.
9378147	9379289	Anyways, that's all.
9379870	9380591	Alright, moving on.
9386292	9387293	No, they just keep getting worse.
9388393	9391655	Actually, I made this quick because I know we've got a lot of chat FUs and stuff.
9392035	9397498	I just want to give a really quick FU to having to move because I hate packing stuff up and all that stuff.
9397978	9407623	And just an FU to Final Fantasy XI for pissing me off the past couple days and just having really bad parties.
9408364	9409064	So that's really all.
9409544	9410445	Otherwise, I'm fine.
9410585	9410845	What?
9411245	9411865	Except for today.
9411905	9412446	Today was great.
9413848	9419250	Goddamn you fucking link shell members and doing your fucking, you know, JSA stuff.
9419550	9421111	I fucking, or JSE stuff.
9421691	9426713	Goddamn you people and your artifact armor not helping me out but doing everybody else's in the link shell.
9427073	9428394	I'm gonna hunt you down and kill you.
9428734	9431335	Alright, let's move on to the in-studio FUs.
9431375	9432655	Guys, please keep them short tonight.
9432675	9433415	We're running out of time.
9433576	9433836	Angel.
9435376	9442439	Um, FU to the stupid radio stations has decided to take over the bowling alley in which I decided to play DDR every week.
9443510	9444330	Mmm, yeah.
9445771	9450212	And, uh, because they stopped us at the door and they were like, you need to pay 50 bucks to get in.
9450252	9450892	We're like, huh?
9451912	9453493	You need to pay 50 bucks to get in.
9453553	9456614	Please turn around and leave if you're not gonna... And I'm like, huh?
9456814	9457114	What?
9457274	9457554	Who?
9457954	9467757	Of course, uh, I didn't... So, um, I was just like, whatever.
9467997	9470998	So we turn around and leave and, like, went to go play DDR somewhere else.
9471570	9477052	and I'm not telling you where, at least on the air, because that's just an embarrassment even to me.
9477732	9491998	But I found out later through Lab Journal that the only reason that they were charging $50 to get into the place was the fact that they had some basketball player there that was signing autographs.
9492638	9494539	I'm going, the hell?
9494919	9496560	Alright, whatever.
9497556	9507508	I'm not even going to go on about how that's weird, because I'm like, what, are the League people going to have to pay $50 too?
9508630	9510732	Don't answer that.
9510752	9517300	If you feel that person that MPK'd us, because that sucks on Final Fantasy XI, you don't just leave like, you know,
9518707	9522669	3, no, 4 monsters that are like way beyond a party's level and then just teleport out.
9522709	9523429	Like, what the?
9523809	9524730	Oh, great, we're dead.
9526931	9527451	Anyways, bye.
9528551	9528851	Mal.
9529892	9530732	Uh, keep them quick.
9531352	9533353	Um, F you to the gas prices right now.
9533373	9536555	I'm having to pay at least $2.60 for a gallon.
9536635	9542337	I mean, up in Sacto, I saw like $2.53 for the cheapest unleaded and I thought, wow, that is cheap.
9543988	9547850	You know, meanwhile, back in my, you know, neck of the woods, it's like, it's in the mid-260s.
9547890	9549151	That's just gotta go, man.
9550751	9557435	And, um, I guess the other F you would be to, uh, ugly chicks who wear those shirts that say hottie or cutie or something.
9557575	9561838	I don't know, I mean, look, I ain't trying to hate or nothing.
9562078	9564439	I know, you know, beauty is cutie and all that kind of good stuff.
9564519	9568381	It's like, I can understand if you wear a shirt that says, like, angel or princess.
9568441	9571683	I know you're somebody's, you know, little toy, but you know what?
9572527	9575348	I just, you know, a word of, just, you know, a little rule of thumb.
9575808	9579149	If your shirt is 4XL, you do not deserve to wear cutie on it.
9581849	9582850	Okay, Shark's Girl.
9584370	9588451	I'm very mellow, so I don't really have anything, which is unusual for me.
9589031	9589852	So I'm just quiet.
9590472	9591232	Yay, happy.
9591652	9593132	Well, F you not being angsty.
9593613	9594333	Well, F you.
9594413	9595133	There you go.
9595233	9595953	Now you happy?
9596293	9596933	Yes, very.
9597053	9597313	All right.
9597994	9598414	Islander.
9599214	9599294	Uh,
9600069	9608914	Just F you to EA Sports Online because I refuse to play my favorite game, my NBA Live, until the rosters are updated from all the major stuff that went down two months ago.
9611856	9613297	Explicit.
9616359	9619481	I want to give an F you to the Cheesecake Factor for charging me $420 on the whole meal.
9619501	9619481	$420!
9619521	9620962	$420!
9619581	9620962	Let's see, there's 32 people.
9630720	9636921	After counting... Okay, including the... Damn, that's a lot of cheesecake.
9636981	9639802	You're going to need one of those 4XL cutie shirts after that.
9643503	9644263	Okay, okay, okay.
9644683	9655125	Anyways, in a serious note, I understand that $60 went to the gratuity and $30 went to tax, but how the hell were we fucking $160 deficits?
9656066	9657246	Someone didn't pay for their meal and...
9657802	9662023	If I find out who the hell did not pay for their meals, I'm going to be pissed off and beat the living shit out of them.
9662944	9665824	I know that 32 people came in, but I know someone's lying on paying their meals.
9666885	9667225	Okay.
9668445	9675247	If it is one girl who bitch slapped me because she thinks I poked her with my penis on the bed... What?
9677428	9679168	Wait, slow down, buddy.
9679208	9679448	What?
9680189	9680529	Okay.
9680929	9681529	I'd like to give you...
9683088	9684789	I mean, make it quick, we gotta wrap this up.
9684809	9692895	Alright, I have to go through this one girl who bitch slapped me because she thought I poked her with a penis on her butt cheek.
9695097	9696117	But you don't get boners.
9698659	9701401	Okay, first of all, that was a point, that was a racket.
9702442	9704063	That was a pointy part of the racket.
9704123	9706825	It's a flat, it's not round, it's not warm.
9706885	9708586	Is that what the kids are calling it these days?
9709944	9712486	Oh, it's just, you want to see my pointy part of the racket?
9712787	9714228	You weren't just happy to see her, right?
9714368	9717090	Honestly, how are you around poking people with their penis anyways?
9717171	9720073	I mean, it was a Reddit place, how do you know who that girl is?
9722896	9728721	F you to all this drama ruckus all over DDR, goddammit, pick your goddamn people wisely.
9728861	9732804	Don't say, ooh, I love this person, I love this, but I feel happiness for this.
9733305	9736908	Blah, blah, blah, you're picking your drama all over me, saying I'm supposed to be
9737942	9739022	The God of Relationships.
9739383	9742924	I can't solve everyone's relationships each and every fucking time.
9745664	9746665	Okay, do be continued.
9747085	9747705	But I can.
9747745	9748705	It's called cyanide.
9749105	9751306	Jamie, one quick one before we get chatroom interviews.
9752727	9753887	I forgot what it was.
9754187	9755247	Remind us later.
9755287	9755567	All right.
9756028	9758188	Guys, if they're long, they're getting cut short tonight.
9758228	9758488	Sorry.
9759309	9759769	Ram.
9760569	9761569	R-H-A-Y-A-M.
9761609	9762289	I think it's Ram.
9763590	9763990	I could have.
9764434	9767957	Sworn, I had this problem last week, or I wasn't sure how to pronounce this, but I think it's Ram.
9768677	9772880	Says, F you to freaking long winter that wreak havoc with my sinuses.
9774582	9779625	SSJ100Matt says, F you to my tire blowing out at the worst time possible on the highway.
9779886	9780046	Ouch.
9780706	9782428	F you to the Yankees losing streak.
9782528	9783068	Go Yanks.
9784489	9790634	LemonLimeJump says, F you to my interweb connection crapping out on me so I couldn't listen to Pump Up the Volume on Tuesday night.
9791975	9792295	Sniff.
9792921	9795702	Elmullet says, F you to company and console fanboys.
9796003	9799724	Can't you have fun with your games and systems without sucking out the enjoyment of others?
9800045	9803366	I'm looking at you, Sony fanboys, and you too, Nintendo fanboys.
9804447	9805687	How about both systems suck?
9806348	9807088	Can I be on that side?
9807128	9807588	No, I'm kidding.
9807708	9808769	They're actually both really good.
9809069	9809990	In their own special way.
9810810	9814592	Blarg says, F you to getting banned from a bar for sneaking in booze.
9817108	9819851	Well, you do know the purpose of a bar, right?
9820051	9821092	Alright, whatever.
9821632	9826757	He also says, F you to getting banned from 4chan.
9829900	9838649	Fireboma says, my F you is to the assholes at EB Games for selling out of PSPs too quickly and then not getting another shipment in for another couple of weeks.
9839679	9841081	Yeah, but they hardly control that.
9841561	9846466	Illusion says F you to not being able to go to the bowling alley on Friday because Larry was busy ice skating.
9846666	9847267	Ice skating!
9847868	9848288	Come on.
9849469	9857898	F you to hardly anyone showing up for karaoke on Saturday night and F you to myself for coming up with such lame-ass F yous to be on the last episode in that studio.
9857978	9858359	Don't worry.
9859200	9860161	We are starting over.
9861149	9867975	Toshin says F you to cheap arcade owners who can buy a 12K gun game but not a 2DX machine.
9868475	9870517	Hmm, sounds like what happened at Scandia.
9874139	9877162	Dork says F you to my English teacher for being totally anal.
9877542	9883167	If the paper is good and the content is good, why the hell are you going to put an F on my paper for a stupid title?
9884817	9887779	MPQ says, I just took up 2DX and I have one FU.
9887919	9892782	Fuck the Safari, fuck Stoic, and fuck all the 2DX bullshit running through those songs.
9892842	9894082	I used to like those songs, too.
9895503	9897884	That got a nice big word from our studio there.
9899025	9903407	LXLDubes says, my FU also goes to fake thug gangstas.
9903868	9909831	The next time I see a nerd white boy walking in my school with shorts down to his ankles, I'm gonna commit suicide.
9910871	9915133	Another FU to Sin City for making me stay up until 2 in the morning at Muviko?
9915413	9916374	I'm sorry if I mispronounced that.
9917114	9921056	I played a game of DDR in their arcade after the movie and almost fell asleep while playing.
9921637	9923918	FU to parents for not believing me when I tell the truth.
9924418	9926479	FU to myself for sucking at life so bad.
9926559	9930021	Oh, and another FU to staying home alone, because I can't think of any better FUs.
9931822	9939105	Legend of Zaku says, FU to New York State University Police for being the pigs that they are by holding the students down when they want to make noise at 3 a.m.
9939125	9939766	in the morning.
9942102	9943563	Don't you know people are trying to study?
9945664	9949007	F you to still not being able to buy a Konami 2DX controller for hella cheap.
9949187	9954891	F you to my lame ass, ant infested, beater of an apartment that I was sent to this year by my campus.
9956652	9961315	Dark Knight says my F you for this week goes to work for being such evil ass hats.
9961775	9964257	And an F you to me for being a broke ass negro.
9965118	9965698	That's his words.
9966579	9968520	DDArchaholic, last one.
9969494	9973015	Daniel, D-Arcoholics passing along one for Daniel.
9973375	9976936	Daniel says, F you to my ex-wife for making my life a living hell.
9977476	9980617	And I think that's a good one to end the F you segment on.
9980757	9981357	Two more.
9981897	9982677	Two really quick ones.
9983517	9983858	Alright.
9983878	9984178	Okay.
9984558	9989439	And F you goes to taxes for being a bitch for not sending me my refunds yet.
9990119	9992720	I filed my taxes like two months ago and still haven't got my refund.
9993880	9994700	Okay, I'll check that out.
9995280	9997261	And F you did his dog for pissing on my tires.
9997381	9997581	This is...
10000492	10007195	I have no pity for the people who haven't gotten their tax money yet.
10007215	10012797	Sorry, Jonas, because I did mine like three months ago, and I got my money two months ago.
10014418	10018940	If you hop on it right when you get it and tele-file, you get your money awfully fast.
10028310	10031592	I would also like to say that I now have no credit, we have no credit card debt.
10057797	10058738	I'm so happy.
10061800	10062400	All right, guys.
10062560	10065842	I could have had a larger refund if fucking golf lane had fucked me over.
10068604	10068924	All right.
10070225	10072006	Ten more minutes left in the show, you guys.
10072366	10077609	And it's kind of the end of the season, the end of a big chapter here in the Orange Lounge radio book.
10078070	10079931	Of course, you know, we've got a little bit of time left.
10079971	10083113	And what do we always do when we have a little time left at the end of the show?
10084173	10086495	Let's ask the Orange Lounge a question.
10090879	10092600	Can I ax you a question?
10092901	10095923	Let's ax Orange Lounge some stupid question.
10096384	10099606	What will we find out tonight on Orange Lounge Radio?
10099967	10103389	Will they ax about the studio since last week we are here?
10103710	10107132	Or will they ax a question about the new place where we're gonna be?
10107273	10108774	Or will they ax something else?
10113257	10116180	Excuse me, I want to ax you a few questions.
10117964	10130570	L. Mullet, assuming Orange Lounge, the band, ever sued you and made you change your name, what would you call your station in its place?
10131390	10136513	I've researched that they can't sue us, ha ha ha, because it's not registered in the United States.
10136533	10137493	Yes, it'll never happen.
10137513	10139234	He says, yes, it'll never happen, but what if?
10140168	10143469	Purple Lounge Radio I was thinking after the store that Dan owned, Game On
10164136	10165237	That would be a good one, too.
10165297	10169121	We haven't really ever sat down and talked about this, but Jamie actually... Jamie's gonna kick your ass!
10169181	10174465	Jamie researched a trademark, and since Orange Lounge actually isn't trademarked in the U.S., we can have it.
10174605	10177508	But Konami knows what we're doing, and they don't care.
10177848	10181011	We'll do what Kentucky Fried Chicken does and just call ourselves OLR.
10181952	10184694	That's possible as well, so... Alright, anyway.
10185895	10186296	Let's see...
10189987	10191868	They're giving us all these Spanish names in the chatroom.
10191888	10192849	I don't know what that is about.
10193009	10193990	El Pantalon.
10194590	10198773	Fireboma says, how many licks does it take to get to the center of Loki's pants?
10201996	10207080	Well, hey, you know, when there's a giant gaping hole in them, one.
10208741	10210562	That's not a question you need to be asking us.
10210602	10211323	Yeah, honestly.
10211843	10215806	We will give you his girlfriend's email address, and you can just ask her directly.
10216227	10217868	Why you want to know this, I don't know.
10220154	10220994	DJ Morpheus
10249713	10250054	Indeed.
10250715	10251716	See, Travis?
10252056	10253338	You can't bullshit me anymore.
10253538	10254800	I just, uh, yeah.
10255041	10256242	I just gave you a shout-out, so there, bye.
10257865	10258145	Alright.
10259206	10260729	Uh, LXLDubes.
10262193	10265074	Why does everyone hate Stoic, Safari, etc.
10265194	10266535	after the new 2DX?
10266675	10268656	I don't hate Stoic, it's Taku.
10268856	10271217	I'm sorry, I don't really follow 2DX.
10271377	10274559	The Safari was never meant to be 150 BPM, that's why.
10274619	10278841	That is actually a big reason why people have a beef with the Safari and the song Get On Beat.
10279121	10283823	When they originally appeared in 3rd and 4th style respectively, they were about 40 BPM.
10284523	10285724	About 130-ish.
10285864	10289946	I've come close to actually beating them, and now I can't and never will.
10290266	10299571	For some reason, and we have no idea why, but when 6th style came out, they sped them up to 160 BPM, and speeding up a song makes it harder in 2DX.
10299611	10302752	You have to hit more keys in a minute, it just automatically makes the song harder.
10303072	10308435	In fact, there was another I was playing in 9th style the other day, the another is just the same damn song sped up.
10309329	10309849	It's crazy.
10310630	10311650	I can't even remember what it was, though.
10311670	10313271	I think it's Distress, I want to say.
10313351	10314271	I think it's Distress, another.
10314371	10314952	It's just sped up.
10315592	10321295	I know that there was one, I don't remember what it was, that had freezes in it, or where it stopped.
10321795	10324496	But in the another, it speeds up or something.
10324817	10325617	I don't remember what song it was.
10325677	10326597	I think it was on 4th style.
10327558	10328598	Oh, I know what you're talking about.
10328638	10329039	Get On Beat?
10329399	10330459	No, it wasn't Get On Beat.
10330479	10331640	No, Checking You Out.
10332020	10332800	Oh, Taku?
10333321	10336002	Checking You Out was faster on... But it did it both ways.
10337142	10337463	It was...
10339418	10340159	Radical Faith?
10341140	10342041	No, it was Radical Faith.
10342081	10344524	I thought it was one of the Tucker songs.
10345385	10345645	Maybe.
10346206	10347947	MPQ has a suggestion in our chatroom.
10347967	10351111	He says they hate them because the note charts are total bullshit!
10353144	10353685	and Hal.
10354045	10356767	But I actually like the Safari, the song.
10357267	10358488	Oh yeah, the songs are great.
10358548	10359769	I mean, 2DX songs are sexy.
10359789	10367476	Well, Get On Beat Wildstyle makes me want to barf up, but... Although, sadly, I think like 5th, 6th, 7th for me was about the peak of 2DX music.
10367596	10368737	I haven't been so into new ones.
10368997	10370058	I think there's good stuff, though.
10370478	10372700	I miss the 4th style booty dancers.
10373981	10376022	We need more 4th style booty dancers.
10377183	10380266	We need the chick in the bandana to come back and we need that weird looking guy.
10381229	10387251	LXL Doobs also is asking, why didn't anybody have sex with the blow-up lamb that Jonas brought tonight?
10388151	10389952	Because... Islanders going for it.
10390032	10390792	Islanders going for it.
10392193	10394654	Because some of us don't need to fake it.
10394694	10395854	Some of us get it for real.
10396674	10397615	Oh!
10397855	10398455	Oh!
10399675	10400876	You can quote her on that one.
10400896	10401836	Oh, Islanders leaving.
10402616	10403797	Officially violated.
10404117	10404617	Wow.
10407458	10407858	All right.
10411189	10416752	You can still buy Pineapple Crush in the ghetto.
10437555	10439036	Go down to Del Paso.
10439096	10441657	I need to go because I miss Pineapple Crush.
10441677	10442177	It was the best.
10442497	10443578	I do still like Pineapple Crush.
10444058	10445439	She says her favorite is Melon Soda.
10445719	10448881	I am developing a fond likeness for Chocolate Soda, though.
10449161	10449541	Ramune.
10450609	10451310	www.DarkSakura.com
10467706	10469808	about two years ago now.
10469848	10470329	It's been a while.
10470369	10471269	Damn, it's really been that long.
10471309	10472691	It was about two years ago I gave up soda.
10473571	10475653	So pineapple's the only thing that would get me to drink regular soda.
10475693	10476894	Otherwise, I stick with pretty much diets.
10477675	10480657	Diet cream soda is the best, though, because it tastes like regular cream soda.
10480677	10481078	It really does.
10481198	10482299	You know what I should do one day?
10482979	10490986	Get some pineapple sugar-free Torani and some half-and-half and some soda water and make pineapple Italian cream soda.
10491246	10491807	I would love you.
10492608	10493048	I would love you.
10493587	10495688	Okay, we got, oh, we only got a little bit of show left.
10495708	10497349	I got to make sure we get some of these other questions here.
10497910	10499771	Illusion, I think this is a good one here.
10500712	10503774	What is your favorite memory of all time in this studio?
10506195	10506695	I'll start.
10507736	10510218	The night we got Karaoke Revolution and played it on air.
10512259	10513900	Honestly, that was some funny shit.
10513980	10514480	It really was.
10515021	10516982	Favorite memory, yeah, Loki sighing.
10517856	10519178	Favorite memory in the studio?
10519218	10519798	Anybody else have one?
10520098	10525084	Also, I would say a few weeks ago, just recently, we had the paparazzi in the studio.
10525124	10525805	That was really cool.
10525825	10527747	That was pretty cool, but they made me play DDR.
10527787	10528567	I'm like, eh.
10529328	10530830	And that article still hasn't run yet.
10530870	10532372	We've been kind of waiting to see when that's going to show up.
10532392	10533172	Towards the end of the month, though.
10533192	10533873	Towards the end of the month?
10533993	10535315	Okay, so we'll see when it shows up.
10535615	10536296	Hopefully this week.
10536956	10538338	Entire episode 69, that's all I've got to say.
10538358	10539459	That was just messed up.
10539479	10540040	I wasn't here.
10557792	10560414	You heard episode 69 though, eventually, didn't you?
10560474	10562255	Yeah, I heard I'm staying in.
10562675	10564896	Yeah, I mean that was that whole karaoke revolution.
10564916	10565656	I mean it was episode 69.
10566617	10567217	What do you expect?
10568238	10570639	I think I was in San Diego staying in the Gay Fry House.
10571239	10572040	You were, you were.
10572740	10574241	We're not going to have that much fun on the show again.
10574261	10575121	In the Harry Potter closet.
10575441	10579063	The next time we will have that much fun on the show will be either episode 187 or episode 420.
10579103	10580404	If we make it that far.
10585342	10586023	You know we will.
10586543	10590306	We are here to stay because my ego will not let us quit.
10592628	10600634	You know, I think that I have fun every week, so every week is a shining star in my memory.
10603997	10605578	Firebomba asked a follow-up question.
10605918	10607900	Do I like Dr. Pepper, Cherry, Vanilla?
10608861	10610442	Unfortunately, no, I do not.
10612643	10613965	That was so my fault, but no.
10615325	10617687	Dr. Pepper, it sounds great.
10617747	10619288	Dr. Pepper, awesome.
10619428	10620789	Cherry Soda, awesome.
10620829	10621630	Vanilla, awesome.
10621770	10622430	And it's diet.
10622650	10627133	I warned you when I went to Alabama and tried that shit there because it wasn't out here yet.
10627154	10629195	And I was like, okay, I'll try something new.
10629875	10635860	I drank probably an ounce of my 20-ounce bottle and threw it away.
10636340	10638842	I didn't even pour it out because the poor plants would have died.
10640825	10645528	Legend of Zaku wants to know, will the ferrets have their own bar and lovemaking pad in the new place?
10648970	10652453	We'll try to think of something special for the ferrets, but we don't have any plans yet.
10653473	10655275	I guess that's the best answer I have for that, sorry.
10656175	10664341	You know, I'm so disappointed that my evil gateway to hell machine is so broken right now.
10665521	10667963	What the hell are you doing?
10669867	10678014	Alright, and Dark Knight, last question, the last Ask Orange Lounge question in this studio.
10678594	10682918	I keep feeling like we're having a final episode of the whole thing, but we're really not.
10682958	10696689	We are coming back, it's just going to be a new chapter, but the final Ask Orange Lounge of this studio is going to Dark Knight, and Dark Knight wants to know, Sky, can you take the webcam and show the studio one more time before the show ends?
10698746	10700708	I took pictures.
10701009	10703211	I don't have an FTP thing on here.
10703651	10710178	If someone will let me email it, I will send it to somebody if they'll put it up on the thing for me.
10710218	10713021	We'll make a gallery on Orange Lounge Radio.
10713101	10714563	We'll get Jamie's pictures and Melody's.
10714623	10716365	Uh-oh, I'm disconnected, I think.
10717466	10718127	Keep going.
10718347	10718767	No, you're there.
10718827	10719308	You're still on.
10720140	10721181	You were talking and it was still on.
10721982	10722883	Oh, my headphones came out.
10722903	10723424	That's what happened.
10724064	10724324	Sorry.
10726667	10727748	His headphones turned gay!
10728329	10728869	Oh, my God!
10730131	10730491	Wow!
10731072	10736197	That right there is my favorite part of Orange Lodge Radio ever in the studio with his headphones turning gay.
10736978	10737418	Shut up.
10737498	10737799	Oh, my God!
10737819	10739240	They're coming onto the mixing board!
10739580	10739941	Woo!
10740582	10741763	All right, my headphones are back.
10741803	10742784	The show sounds okay again.
10744457	10747099	If you could take pictures too, because you've got a camera, and then we'll put them on our website.
10747199	10747899	Yeah, that would be great.
10748699	10749179	The studio.
10749199	10749620	The studio.
10750040	10757303	And none of me, because I'm never... Okay, I'm going to take one picture after the show, but this is going to sound completely dirty.
10757964	10759144	We all have to cram into the kitchen.
10759964	10763826	No, I won't be in any pictures, because I'm not supposed to be.
10764066	10765867	I am mysterious, goddammit.
10767748	10769589	Okay, anyway, so that's it.
10770395	10772339	and thus is the end of episode 139.
10773381	10776928	When we come back, season 6, episode 140.
10778459	10779439	We are starting over.
10779959	10782200	New studio, new sound for the station.
10782800	10784300	Orange Launch Radio, what gamers really want.
10784941	10788041	Should I be disturbed that Jonas can put his entire fist in his mouth?
10789302	10790522	I don't know.
10791282	10794663	Once again, to end the show on a sappy note, thank you guys to the listeners.
10796223	10797324	We do this because of you guys.
10797784	10799864	You guys rock, honestly.
10800244	10802845	Some of you guys have been supporting the station since episode one.
10803625	10806567	Some of you guys, I know, like, just there's folks that have been listening since episode one.
10806587	10807748	Some of you guys haven't been listening.
10808229	10811611	A lot of guys didn't come on board until, remember when we had the Uran premiere?
10811651	10813132	We got a lot of new people that night.
10813372	10814193	That was very awesome.
10814213	10818136	So thanks again to Mel B for helping hook us up with that.
10818176	10819637	You totally pimped our ride.
10819717	10820357	Miklatov.
10822059	10823099	Miklatov as well.
10823119	10823800	Damn right.
10823840	10825241	That really expanded our fan base.
10825859	10834525	Big thank you to DDR Freak Radio, who we've been doing more work with in the past year, showing that two stations with similar interests can work together for the common good.
10835245	10844131	And also a big thank you to Under Sedation Live, for which none of this, if Under Sedation Live did not exist, probably none of this would exist either.
10844211	10845192	We love you.
10845272	10847754	So, anything else?
10848194	10851256	Since we're not going to get to do an acceptance speech at the Best of Awards, probably.
10851496	10852837	This world is bullshit!
10854018	10855599	Go with yourself, just go with yourself.
10861421	10863282	We will be here next week with a show.
10863342	10866223	It'll just be a tape show, but it'll be kind of a bookend show.
10866263	10867883	It'll just be something to tie this week together.
10868464	10870984	In two weeks, May 1st, Orange Lounge Radio version 2.0.
10872205	10873325	What gamers really want to know.
10876486	10878307	And now, final thoughts.
10878547	10880668	And Mel B, you've got the mic, so you've got to start us off, buddy.
10882387	10882867	Oh, man.
10882967	10888230	Well, I just hope that in this next place that we have, we'll actually have some furniture set up.
10889070	10896094	You know what sucks is the next studio is actually smaller, but it's just for, like, computers and Orange Lounge, so that's kind of the trade-off.
10896474	10901016	But, you know, it was a lot more fun at the old house where we all had to be on top of each other.
10901036	10901917	It's going to be that again.
10901977	10902697	It's going to be that again.
10903197	10906319	Okay, just for that, you've got to, like, mount some twister mats on the bottom of the floor.
10906539	10908040	But with better ventilation.
10909794	10911577	There's a window right there.
10911657	10912257	It's going to be nice.
10912598	10916823	But yeah, for going five seasons strong, I got to say, man, this is a pretty cool setup.
10917043	10922229	And I mean, on behalf of DDR Spot, I want to give you lots of props for keeping this thing going.
10922842	10925344	I mean, you probably do a hell of a lot better than we do on the upkeep.
10925384	10933509	But hey, anything we can do, like they say, as far as from Spot's standpoint, if we can't win the race, we'll help the people in front of us break the record.
10934170	10934630	Thank you, buddy.
10934650	10935230	I appreciate that.
10935250	10935711	Thank you.
10935731	10936031	Thank you.
10936051	10936691	That's so sweet.
10936771	10941214	And, you know, Mel has not only done a lot for the station, but he's also helped me out a lot personally as well.
10941274	10942595	He did our first promo.
10942896	10943236	He did.
10943556	10944817	He was our first celebrity promo.
10944837	10947899	And we've been running that promo ever since.
10948199	10949640	He's our first celebrity promo.
10950681	10950941	Wow.
10951610	10952731	Sharks Girl, final thought.
10953451	10961818	Well, it's been fun in here, and when I heard you guys were doing the last show in this studio and I had nothing to do, I was like, I have to go up there just to harass them.
10961858	10964100	I'm not going to tell anybody I'm showing up.
10965401	10970264	You've been a very frequent guest that has to drive a long way to get here, and we appreciate that.
10970284	10971405	About two hours at a time.
10971445	10972786	That is hella dedication.
10972826	10974147	We totally appreciate that, Sharks Girl.
10974167	10980492	It's always, always fun, and just hoping to best wishes for the new studio and as many good memories there are as we've had here.
10981334	10981614	All right.
10981974	10983395	And Jonas.
10984455	10984795	Jonas.
10987196	10989916	Well, it's been one hell of a ride, I got to say.
10990076	10992777	Now, you do know, no show next week, right?
10992817	10993837	So don't come here.
10993957	10995758	I'm going to be busy anyway, so.
10995918	10997158	Oh, okay.
10997198	10998719	Bitch is not a eulogy.
11000839	11006141	But anyway, I'm hoping the new move will be a great move and stuff, and hopefully things turn out pretty well.
11007181	11010682	I'm looking forward to see the next Orange Lounge, the next week for Orange Lounge Radio.
11011127	11011367	Angel
11040295	11069584	Although I haven't been listening since episode 1, I have been listening since episode 26 Been good times since then, been good times at this place And hope to continue it when we get to the new studio Good times to come, here we go Loki I'll be honest, this studio is a big hole Okay, the whole apartment is falling apart I mean, there's mold in my room I mean, the window's falling off The peephole goddamn shot out at me today Well, no, not today, but the other day
11070199	11071600	DarkSakura, you want me to go?
11099842	11101691	They have a request to hear the grudge sound real fast.
11105049	11106430	Thank you.
11106450	11108391	You know, I'm going to have to show this to you.
11108471	11115036	In the new place, in my new roommate, who, by the way, has never been on this show and has no idea what to expect, my new roommate.
11115817	11116497	He's a gamer, though.
11116517	11117438	He likes Donkey Konga.
11117638	11118339	He loves that game.
11118899	11119619	So we'll see what happens.
11119960	11120480	My new roommate.
11121281	11123442	In his bedroom, he has the master bedroom in the new place.
11123742	11127925	In his bedroom, there's actually a little cutout that goes to the attic type thing.
11128406	11129486	And I did that the other night.
11129547	11130968	I started going, uh.
11131088	11132188	And now he says he can't sleep.
11132208	11132629	You know...
11134190	11142297	One of Dan's assistant managers at GameStop said that that sound is made by the vocal cords that control your high pitch and your low pitch.
11142757	11146000	That if you can make that noise, it means you have a very good vocal capacity.
11147801	11149242	Still ain't gonna get me to sing karaoke.
11149923	11155147	Alright, my final thought is, again guys, I know this is sounding like a last show, but it is not over.
11155748	11157209	We are starting over.
11159572	11161933	I'm going to go with what I've been going with lately.
11162113	11163274	Reject false icons.
11163374	11164194	Think for yourself.
11164234	11165034	Decide what you like.
11165835	11166135	All right.
11167295	11167575	Islander?
11171097	11172717	Angels fly because they take themselves lightly.
11174098	11174478	All right.
11175459	11176059	All right, guys.
