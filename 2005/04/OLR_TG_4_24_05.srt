00:00:00,623 --> 00:00:03,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of April 25th, 2005.

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:14,573
[SPEAKER_00]: You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

3
00:00:14,853 --> 00:00:18,355
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

4
00:00:21,537 --> 00:00:25,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, good morning, afternoon, or evening to you, whatever the case may be.

5
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,763
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's kind of the neat thing about podcasts, is that you can listen to them whenever you feel like it.

6
00:00:30,598 --> 00:00:39,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you are listening to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your home for gamer chat and what gamers really want to know when you talk about games that don't suck.

7
00:00:40,266 --> 00:00:41,467
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple that do, sometimes.

8
00:00:42,248 --> 00:00:43,789
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

9
00:00:43,849 --> 00:00:48,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me as always, my awesome co-host, say hello to Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.

10
00:00:49,514 --> 00:00:50,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Woo!

11
00:00:50,775 --> 00:00:51,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Woo!

12
00:00:52,216 --> 00:00:52,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Exciting.

13
00:00:52,977 --> 00:00:53,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Exciting day, isn't it?

14
00:00:54,278 --> 00:00:54,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Old.

15
00:00:54,918 --> 00:00:57,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Also with us, say hello to Loki.

16
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

17
00:00:58,581 --> 00:00:59,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, how you doing?

18
00:01:00,487 --> 00:01:00,947
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

19
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:34,688
[SPEAKER_03]: The same position I always keep during the show, which is in this big comfy green thing.

20
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:35,889
[SPEAKER_02]: In your big comfy green chair.

21
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:36,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

22
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:41,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyway, let's start off talking about our own gaming week and then we'll get into some gaming news.

23
00:01:41,312 --> 00:01:42,752
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a lot of interesting news tonight.

24
00:01:43,253 --> 00:01:44,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting off though, how was your gaming week?

25
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:46,334
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of games have you been playing this week, DarkSakura?

26
00:01:46,354 --> 00:01:47,415
[SPEAKER_03]: I finally played Luminous.

27
00:01:48,015 --> 00:01:48,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, what'd you think?

28
00:01:49,756 --> 00:01:50,657
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty fun.

29
00:01:50,697 --> 00:01:51,237
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked the music.

30
00:01:51,257 --> 00:01:55,299
[SPEAKER_03]: I did the single player mode, which I got to level 13 on.

31
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:59,161
[SPEAKER_03]: You start off picking your skin, so that's all I did.

32
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:03,558
[SPEAKER_02]: So you didn't play the mode where you progressed through the different skins.

33
00:02:03,598 --> 00:02:04,619
[SPEAKER_02]: You just stuck with one.

34
00:02:05,139 --> 00:02:06,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I picked one skin and got to level 13.

35
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,981
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

36
00:02:08,521 --> 00:02:15,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I'll tell you, the weird thing about Luminous when you're playing that skin mode the first time where you're going through the different skins is you kind of don't expect it.

37
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:18,649
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're playing and then suddenly all the colors change.

38
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:20,370
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, what the hell did I do?

39
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is everything changing color?

40
00:02:22,252 --> 00:02:22,892
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of freaky.

41
00:02:23,272 --> 00:02:24,193
[SPEAKER_03]: It does sound pretty freaky.

42
00:02:25,334 --> 00:02:28,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Apart from that, it was more widescreen pong and...

43
00:02:29,201 --> 00:02:30,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a lot much else.

44
00:02:30,281 --> 00:02:31,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Usual webby games.

45
00:02:31,922 --> 00:02:37,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I avoided the Jeep simulator again because it really made me motion sick.

46
00:02:37,483 --> 00:02:41,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just me or are we kind of a little bit of a dry spell right now?

47
00:02:41,063 --> 00:02:45,224
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, sure, there's some games, but we're kind of in a dry spell right now until E3.

48
00:02:45,284 --> 00:02:46,645
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be like the big boom.

49
00:02:46,825 --> 00:02:51,726
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pissed off because Dan traded my copy of Darkstalkers for stupid Midnight Club.

50
00:02:52,026 --> 00:02:52,966
[SPEAKER_02]: What's Midnight Club?

51
00:02:53,026 --> 00:02:53,666
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know.

52
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:54,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Dub Edition.

53
00:02:54,566 --> 00:02:56,647
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's one of those games we don't talk about on this show usually.

54
00:02:58,329 --> 00:03:12,132
[SPEAKER_01]: The last Midnight Club that I played, I cheated the hell out of it and we basically got this jet car type thing where we're just driving super fast around for no reason.

55
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well how was your gaming week since we're on you anyway?

56
00:03:16,754 --> 00:03:17,954
[SPEAKER_01]: Ridge Racer, PSP.

57
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:19,572
[SPEAKER_02]: That is it.

58
00:03:19,872 --> 00:03:26,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because you're in the middle of moving right now, so you're probably like me, because when you hear about how my gaming week was, it's very similar.

59
00:03:26,698 --> 00:03:27,739
[SPEAKER_02]: No consoles this week, really.

60
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:37,307
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Final Fantasy for all of one minute to log in to get the update, and then, well, obviously I didn't take a minute, but, you know, logged in, said hi, and then logged out, and that was it.

61
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:44,854
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, just now that Comcast is down, um, I can't play my online game, um,

62
00:03:45,509 --> 00:04:05,326
[SPEAKER_01]: No, so I've been playing a lot of PSP because I bring my PSP to work in my Tashi case so it looks like I have a briefcase walking in but it's actually my PSP and I play that during breaks and during lunch and whatnot and so I've been like playing a race here, a race there, unlocking cars as I go along and I'm actually pretty good at the game.

63
00:04:07,048 --> 00:04:11,592
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of, I have fishtail every now and then but I'm getting the drifting down pretty good and apparently I

64
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,699
[SPEAKER_01]: I drift a lot because that's how you get the nitros in the game.

65
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:17,679
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a lot of nitros.

66
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:18,999
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty cool.

67
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,599
[SPEAKER_01]: I like how they have all the old tracks in it.

68
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:21,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

69
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,481
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you heard about any new hacks on the PSP lately?

70
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:27,621
[SPEAKER_01]: What isn't there?

71
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:29,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

72
00:04:29,401 --> 00:04:33,682
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the hack where you can control your iTunes with your PSP.

73
00:04:33,742 --> 00:04:34,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I read about that one too.

74
00:04:36,222 --> 00:04:40,363
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the hack where you can control your house with the PSP assuming you have a wired house, which

75
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,541
[SPEAKER_01]: All of five people have.

76
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:45,901
[SPEAKER_02]: How many people our age have wired houses like that?

77
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:48,342
[SPEAKER_02]: I want one.

78
00:04:48,442 --> 00:04:50,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Want and have are different things, though.

79
00:04:50,283 --> 00:04:52,363
[SPEAKER_01]: PSP Tetris, but it's just online Tetris.

80
00:04:53,163 --> 00:04:55,884
[SPEAKER_01]: All of them revolve around the browser hacking.

81
00:04:55,924 --> 00:04:58,145
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just all web applets, so it's really stupid.

82
00:04:58,485 --> 00:05:00,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Suddenly, sales of Wipeout are incredibly popular.

83
00:05:00,946 --> 00:05:08,708
[SPEAKER_01]: MSN, or was it... Yeah, Microsoft, their messenger...

84
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,421
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

85
00:05:34,113 --> 00:05:35,234
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

86
00:06:01,497 --> 00:06:04,741
[SPEAKER_01]: The PSP hacks so far have been pretty stupid, to be honest.

87
00:06:04,842 --> 00:06:07,485
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there hasn't been really anything cool.

88
00:06:07,525 --> 00:06:18,239
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been one that I saw that was kind of neat where you can put an external antenna on your Wi-Fi because I guess there's a little cord inside there that's actually just a Wi-Fi antenna and you can just

89
00:06:18,888 --> 00:06:20,228
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

90
00:06:49,697 --> 00:06:55,225
[SPEAKER_01]: on a live journal or something, but then my fiance got there at the key, so I didn't get to.

91
00:06:56,046 --> 00:06:56,407
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

92
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:03,391
[SPEAKER_02]: My gaming week was kind of very similar to yours because I'm also in the process of moving right now, obviously.

93
00:07:04,052 --> 00:07:09,173
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't really have any consoles hooked up right now, which is too bad because I wanted to check out how Halo 2 was going to be after the patches.

94
00:07:09,193 --> 00:07:13,474
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to check out the brand new song pack that just came out for DDR Ultramix 2.

95
00:07:14,414 --> 00:07:15,574
[SPEAKER_02]: What new song pack?

96
00:07:15,594 --> 00:07:18,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there was a new song pack that came out out of nowhere on Ultramix 2.

97
00:07:18,495 --> 00:07:19,555
[SPEAKER_02]: What songs do they have in that?

98
00:07:19,995 --> 00:07:22,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Waverer and Love This Feelin'.

99
00:07:23,496 --> 00:07:24,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Waverer?

100
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:26,097
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like an old school song.

101
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Waivers from Silent Hill.

102
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:29,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

103
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:30,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?

104
00:07:30,582 --> 00:07:31,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, crazy, huh?

105
00:07:31,982 --> 00:07:33,663
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are we talking about this on a normal show?

106
00:07:33,823 --> 00:07:35,023
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally forgot.

107
00:07:35,603 --> 00:07:35,944
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.

108
00:07:36,324 --> 00:07:37,944
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even know the songs that came out.

109
00:07:37,984 --> 00:07:40,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Exclusive podcast material.

110
00:07:40,285 --> 00:07:41,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Exclusive, yeah.

111
00:07:41,626 --> 00:07:49,969
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's funny, ever since we made that change to saying we're not going to talk about rhythm and music games so much on the podcast, it seems to be we get a story every week now.

112
00:07:50,908 --> 00:07:51,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well.

113
00:07:51,648 --> 00:07:53,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's on Pac-10, so go check it out.

114
00:07:54,249 --> 00:07:57,550
[SPEAKER_02]: But, okay, so I've been wanting to play consoles, but I really just, you know, everything's in a box.

115
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,671
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to, you know, hook it up and play.

116
00:08:00,071 --> 00:08:01,291
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been playing DS.

117
00:08:01,711 --> 00:08:02,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of PSP, I've been playing DS.

118
00:08:03,272 --> 00:08:03,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Driller.

119
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:11,454
[SPEAKER_02]: I strangely, for some reason, when I first got my DS, I kind of plugged in the Metroid demo, and then I went, eh, and put it away.

120
00:08:11,634 --> 00:08:12,614
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost my demo.

121
00:08:12,754 --> 00:08:15,135
[SPEAKER_02]: I put it back in, and I'm playing the Metroid demo again.

122
00:08:15,735 --> 00:08:16,396
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty cool.

123
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,417
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to the full game.

124
00:08:19,017 --> 00:08:19,618
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is weird.

125
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:25,081
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird because I wasn't into Metroid First Person on the GameCube.

126
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:27,403
[SPEAKER_02]: But for some reason on the DS it doesn't bug me at all.

127
00:08:27,783 --> 00:08:29,164
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's just because the controls are different.

128
00:08:29,184 --> 00:08:30,745
[SPEAKER_01]: It hurts the hell out of my hand.

129
00:08:31,365 --> 00:08:31,666
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm weird.

130
00:08:31,986 --> 00:08:32,466
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

131
00:08:32,506 --> 00:08:34,207
[SPEAKER_01]: My hand cramps up from playing that game.

132
00:08:34,267 --> 00:08:37,109
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just because you have to hold it all weird and stuff.

133
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:37,369
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

134
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,190
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't like it.

135
00:08:39,731 --> 00:08:39,991
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

136
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:40,527
[SPEAKER_02]: May 14th

137
00:08:59,674 --> 00:09:03,437
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a reminder, that's going to be at Rockefeller Plaza in Midtown Manhattan.

138
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:09,121
[SPEAKER_02]: And based on what they're going to be doing, they're going to be having a huge party the opening day and giving away prizes.

139
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:11,043
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're in the New York area, you might want to go check that out.

140
00:09:11,063 --> 00:09:12,324
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Saturday, May 14th.

141
00:09:12,964 --> 00:09:18,348
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, the facility will also be the home of the Pokemon Trading Card Game League.

142
00:09:18,368 --> 00:09:19,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that'll keep me away from that.

143
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,691
[SPEAKER_01]: That and the fact that it's on the other side.

144
00:09:21,711 --> 00:09:24,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there'll be plenty more to do than just Pokemon.

145
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:25,834
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just one aspect of it.

146
00:09:26,014 --> 00:09:26,534
[SPEAKER_01]: Walk in.

147
00:09:26,574 --> 00:09:28,676
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to walk into the store.

148
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:30,136
[SPEAKER_01]: Doot, doot, doot, doot.

149
00:09:30,156 --> 00:09:31,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Seizure fever!

150
00:09:31,397 --> 00:09:31,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Woo!

151
00:09:33,037 --> 00:09:34,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Porygon!

152
00:09:35,758 --> 00:09:38,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to a news, something going on with the PSP.

153
00:09:38,598 --> 00:09:41,219
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how we've been getting a lot of UMD movies here?

154
00:09:41,239 --> 00:09:43,259
[SPEAKER_02]: It's starting to kind of pick up the format a little bit.

155
00:09:43,659 --> 00:09:46,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Loki, you're somebody who actually works in the distribution industry.

156
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:47,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

157
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think UMDs are going to catch on?

158
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:50,181
[SPEAKER_01]: They say they are.

159
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,862
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's stupid, to be honest.

160
00:09:52,922 --> 00:09:58,229
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't spend my money on fucking buying a portable system to bring games.

161
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,292
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're buying the games, why do you need the UMDs?

162
00:10:01,413 --> 00:10:07,480
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're never sitting down long enough to watch a whole friggin' movie, and by the time you do, your battery's spent.

163
00:10:08,151 --> 00:10:09,451
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

164
00:10:35,621 --> 00:10:35,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of.

165
00:10:36,181 --> 00:10:41,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the story I wanted to read for you guys is that actually in Japan, they're going to be getting some new UMD movies.

166
00:10:41,244 --> 00:10:43,405
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of American movies do you think are coming out in Japan?

167
00:10:44,646 --> 00:10:45,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Kill Bill?

168
00:10:45,526 --> 00:10:45,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Hitch?

169
00:10:46,467 --> 00:10:47,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, here they are.

170
00:10:47,127 --> 00:10:48,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the movies that are coming out in Japan.

171
00:10:48,868 --> 00:10:53,631
[SPEAKER_02]: On June 22nd, Sony Pictures Entertainment is going to be releasing 13 Ghosts.

172
00:10:54,231 --> 00:10:55,052
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember that movie?

173
00:10:55,552 --> 00:10:57,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Had the chick from American Pie in it?

174
00:10:57,193 --> 00:10:57,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

175
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:01,695
[SPEAKER_02]: 13 Ghosts, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.

176
00:11:01,855 --> 00:11:02,516
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good movie.

177
00:11:03,436 --> 00:11:04,737
[SPEAKER_02]: And Charlie's Angels.

178
00:11:05,327 --> 00:11:05,787
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

179
00:11:06,488 --> 00:11:07,529
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see where that would fly.

180
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:09,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, not the sequel, but the first one.

181
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Charlie's Angels, the first one.

182
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Get this, get this.

183
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:13,654
[SPEAKER_02]: You got served.

184
00:11:15,095 --> 00:11:21,080
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's exactly what I'm saying to the Japanese PSP audience right now with that release.

185
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,681
[SPEAKER_03]: They're importing American games.

186
00:11:23,622 --> 00:11:24,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, isn't that weird?

187
00:11:24,282 --> 00:11:27,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's games here that aren't out there.

188
00:11:27,525 --> 00:11:28,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, they have pack picks already.

189
00:11:29,747 --> 00:11:30,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, differences.

190
00:11:32,689 --> 00:11:32,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh.

191
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:33,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh.

192
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:36,189
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I just thought I'd share that.

193
00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:41,130
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you think the movies we're getting here are a little weird, just remember, in Japan, they're getting You Got Served.

194
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,011
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still waiting for Smart Bomb to come out.

195
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,631
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

196
00:11:44,191 --> 00:11:45,751
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a puzzle game for the PSP.

197
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:47,992
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of puzzle games coming out for different systems.

198
00:11:48,012 --> 00:11:48,672
[SPEAKER_01]: It got pushed back, though.

199
00:11:48,772 --> 00:11:49,472
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty cool.

200
00:11:49,512 --> 00:11:52,213
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of like... I don't really know how to describe it.

201
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:53,253
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a bunch of different puzzles.

202
00:11:54,753 --> 00:11:56,714
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be like if you slowed down...

203
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:01,294
[SPEAKER_01]: WarioWare, and have each puzzle last a little longer.

204
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:02,335
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like that.

205
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:05,317
[SPEAKER_02]: We are getting so many puzzle games in the different handhelds.

206
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:09,741
[SPEAKER_02]: On the PSP, Mercury just came out recently, Luminous,

207
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I might be mispronouncing that, but there's a new game coming out.

208
00:12:14,242 --> 00:12:14,942
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a puzzle game.

209
00:12:15,283 --> 00:12:18,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Sticky Balls is another game that's coming out on BSP.

210
00:12:18,425 --> 00:12:18,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Puzzle game.

211
00:12:19,286 --> 00:12:20,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Smart Bomb.

212
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:21,228
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the one you just mentioned.

213
00:12:21,468 --> 00:12:27,533
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the DS, we're getting Electroplankton, Meteos, Polarium.

214
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,055
[SPEAKER_01]: Electroplankton's not even really a game.

215
00:12:30,115 --> 00:12:32,557
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like stuff happens.

216
00:12:33,017 --> 00:12:34,438
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have Electroplankton.

217
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:34,819
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

218
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, the early reviews I'm reading on it say that it might be a little bit overrated.

219
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:42,700
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know yet.

220
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:43,921
[SPEAKER_02]: I still want to see it.

221
00:12:43,941 --> 00:12:45,283
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Seaman, okay?

222
00:12:48,106 --> 00:12:49,127
[SPEAKER_02]: She played Seaman.

223
00:12:49,148 --> 00:12:52,251
[SPEAKER_03]: I used the American name, thank you.

224
00:12:54,934 --> 00:12:55,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

225
00:12:56,115 --> 00:12:56,715
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

226
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,450
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think this is going to mean for the future?

227
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:25,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, the reason why they're doing this, a lot of people see it as GameStop is buying their biggest competitor, but you have to think of it this way.

228
00:13:25,552 --> 00:13:28,273
[SPEAKER_02]: The biggest competitor, really, is Walmart.

229
00:13:29,213 --> 00:13:30,473
[SPEAKER_02]: That's their biggest competitor.

230
00:13:30,573 --> 00:13:40,476
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's happening is that GameStop and EB are kind of teaming up to take on Walmart, which I think is very interesting, and those very big super vendors, Best Buys and Targets, things like that as well.

231
00:13:41,116 --> 00:13:41,757
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think of this?

232
00:13:42,117 --> 00:13:44,237
[SPEAKER_03]: When evil has purchased the greater evil.

233
00:13:47,463 --> 00:13:49,323
[SPEAKER_02]: And in other news, service still sucks.

234
00:13:51,584 --> 00:14:05,726
[SPEAKER_02]: What's interesting, if you take polls, if you go to different internet forums, because every gaming forum is lit up on this topic, it's like, it depends on the area you live, whether the EB store is better or the GameStop store is better.

235
00:14:06,026 --> 00:14:10,647
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think somebody was joking on the three-hour show this week that it's like the red states and the blue states.

236
00:14:11,687 --> 00:14:14,688
[SPEAKER_02]: It just depends on your neck of the woods, which store is better.

237
00:14:15,028 --> 00:14:16,188
[SPEAKER_02]: So people are very...

238
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,401
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's almost like half and half.

239
00:14:20,822 --> 00:14:23,144
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

240
00:14:23,364 --> 00:14:23,684
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

241
00:14:24,585 --> 00:14:25,226
[SPEAKER_01]: They both suck.

242
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:27,908
[SPEAKER_01]: They really, they both do.

243
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:34,233
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I went to the mall, Arden Mall, and they had like, you know, I asked, do you have any PSP's?

244
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,215
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're never gonna find one.

245
00:14:36,495 --> 00:14:37,095
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah!

246
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:41,559
[SPEAKER_01]: And went to GameStop, you know, they gave me the same spiel, but the best part, oh look, there's a pile of them.

247
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,681
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got them at Dan's store.

248
00:14:44,021 --> 00:14:44,762
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

249
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:46,263
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said,

250
00:14:46,618 --> 00:14:47,578
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck you, people.

251
00:14:48,119 --> 00:14:49,099
[SPEAKER_01]: You suck.

252
00:14:49,479 --> 00:14:50,820
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because you went to the mall.

253
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:51,941
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

254
00:14:52,121 --> 00:14:52,621
[SPEAKER_01]: I was over there.

255
00:14:54,002 --> 00:14:54,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

256
00:14:55,422 --> 00:14:56,383
[SPEAKER_02]: The Nintendo DS.

257
00:14:57,243 --> 00:14:58,604
[SPEAKER_02]: This is no surprise.

258
00:14:58,864 --> 00:14:59,924
[SPEAKER_02]: What new story?

259
00:14:59,964 --> 00:15:05,147
[SPEAKER_02]: If I said Nintendo was launching a brand new peripheral, what do you think it is?

260
00:15:06,207 --> 00:15:07,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Here in the US, finally.

261
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:09,289
[SPEAKER_02]: They already had it in Japan.

262
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:15,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it something that you can buy over and over and over again and still be suckered into buying another one?

263
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:15,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

264
00:15:15,712 --> 00:15:15,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

265
00:15:17,304 --> 00:15:19,967
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to let you know something.

266
00:15:42,266 --> 00:15:43,506
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually a website out there.

267
00:15:43,806 --> 00:15:46,327
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I don't remember the exact website URL.

268
00:15:46,347 --> 00:15:48,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what a useful tip this is.

269
00:15:48,827 --> 00:15:49,168
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut up.

270
00:15:49,248 --> 00:16:02,650
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, it's basically you can get your Xbox, your PlayStation 2, your DS, or your Game Boy SP or whatever in any color you want.

271
00:16:03,651 --> 00:16:05,571
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to buy from Nintendo.

272
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:05,631
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

273
00:16:06,024 --> 00:16:08,965
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to wait for them to come out with another color.

274
00:16:09,045 --> 00:16:10,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Those crappy stickers that you put on?

275
00:16:10,865 --> 00:16:12,165
[SPEAKER_02]: No, custom paint jobs.

276
00:16:12,785 --> 00:16:13,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, gosh.

277
00:16:13,826 --> 00:16:15,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Pimp my DS, is that what this is?

278
00:16:16,306 --> 00:16:19,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, maybe I can have camo.

279
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,407
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can select which color.

280
00:16:20,707 --> 00:16:24,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, for the Xbox and PS2 systems, they come with controllers that match.

281
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:33,170
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like, seriously, people, you don't have to... This is something I would be expecting, like, you know, Paris Hilton to buy a system to match her purse or something.

282
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,290
[SPEAKER_01]: She did buy a PSP.

283
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, shut up.

284
00:16:36,021 --> 00:16:38,622
[SPEAKER_03]: She probably went and had that gem crusting done to it, too.

285
00:16:40,643 --> 00:16:45,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Also in June, when the blue DS comes out, Nintendo's going to be putting out some DS games.

286
00:16:46,104 --> 00:16:46,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

287
00:16:47,045 --> 00:16:48,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Some pretty neat ones at that.

288
00:16:48,225 --> 00:16:48,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Meteos.

289
00:16:48,985 --> 00:16:50,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Meteos is one of them coming out in June.

290
00:16:51,006 --> 00:16:57,528
[SPEAKER_02]: And Kirby Canvas Curse, which implies it's going to be a Kirby game that uses a stylus.

291
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:58,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Big surprise, huh?

292
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:02,950
[SPEAKER_01]: When are we getting Mario Paint DS?

293
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:03,170
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

294
00:17:05,934 --> 00:17:06,234
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

295
00:17:06,814 --> 00:17:07,475
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want.

296
00:17:07,515 --> 00:17:08,295
[SPEAKER_03]: That would make sense.

297
00:17:08,315 --> 00:17:08,795
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be cool.

298
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:10,235
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

299
00:17:10,355 --> 00:17:14,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's the game in WarioWare, the mini game.

300
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:15,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.

301
00:17:15,397 --> 00:17:15,957
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the same.

302
00:17:18,118 --> 00:17:20,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but nothing beats the gelatin game.

303
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:23,259
[SPEAKER_02]: The gelatin game is the best.

304
00:17:23,769 --> 00:17:33,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Orange Lounge Radio, we're not just here to talk about games, because if we talked about games all day long, we'd have no time to go terrorize children at the local arcade.

305
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:43,043
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we're here to better your life, and what way better your life than to allow our very own DarkSakura to give you her advice column.

306
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:44,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, joy.

307
00:17:46,085 --> 00:17:47,766
[SPEAKER_02]: She's enthused about her own column.

308
00:17:48,327 --> 00:17:50,448
[SPEAKER_02]: What advice do you have for us tonight, DarkSakura?

309
00:17:51,129 --> 00:17:52,690
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think enthused is a word.

310
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:54,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

311
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Way to go, Grammarly.

312
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, thank you for that advice column.

313
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,531
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just end that segment.

314
00:18:00,971 --> 00:18:01,471
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

315
00:18:01,551 --> 00:18:02,291
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a favorite.

316
00:18:03,952 --> 00:18:05,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, what's the advice column about tonight?

317
00:18:06,112 --> 00:18:08,153
[SPEAKER_03]: How to foil a UFO abduction.

318
00:18:09,493 --> 00:18:11,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one, do not panic.

319
00:18:11,994 --> 00:18:18,755
[SPEAKER_03]: The extraterrestrial biological entity, or EBE, may sense your fear and act rashly.

320
00:18:19,836 --> 00:18:21,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Two, control your thoughts.

321
00:18:22,008 --> 00:18:23,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not think of anything violent or upsetting.

322
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:26,929
[SPEAKER_03]: The EBE may have the ability to read your mind.

323
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:31,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to avoid mental images of abduction, boarding the saucer, or anal probes.

324
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:36,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Such images may encourage... I knew an anal probe would come up somewhere in this.

325
00:18:38,012 --> 00:18:38,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Resist verbally.

326
00:18:39,373 --> 00:18:43,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Firmly tell the EBE to leave you alone.

327
00:18:43,534 --> 00:18:44,614
[SPEAKER_02]: No means no!

328
00:18:45,595 --> 00:18:46,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Resist mentally.

329
00:18:47,435 --> 00:18:50,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Picture yourself enveloped in a protective shield of white light.

330
00:18:51,187 --> 00:18:52,268
[SPEAKER_03]: or in a safe place.

331
00:18:52,488 --> 00:18:55,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Telepathic EBEs may get the message.

332
00:18:55,391 --> 00:18:55,371
5.

333
00:18:55,811 --> 00:18:56,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Resist physically.

334
00:18:57,013 --> 00:19:00,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Physical resistance should only be used as a last resort.

335
00:19:00,296 --> 00:19:02,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Go for the EBE's eyes if it has any.

336
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:06,702
[SPEAKER_03]: You will not know what its other more sensitive areas are.

337
00:19:08,243 --> 00:19:09,705
[SPEAKER_03]: But my final advice?

338
00:19:09,905 --> 00:19:10,165
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

339
00:19:10,786 --> 00:19:11,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't live in the Midwest.

340
00:19:12,367 --> 00:19:12,768
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

341
00:19:12,808 --> 00:19:16,171
[SPEAKER_01]: My final advice is, holy shit, if there's a fucking alien coming after you,

342
00:19:16,773 --> 00:19:19,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, poking the eye is going to piss the fucker off.

343
00:19:20,655 --> 00:19:29,219
[SPEAKER_01]: If I were the alien, because basically the aliens would look at us like bugs, I would throw you across the fucking room, smash you into a wall or something.

344
00:19:29,659 --> 00:19:32,501
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, seriously, they could probably just crack you in half.

345
00:19:34,909 --> 00:19:37,169
[SPEAKER_01]: Besides, we know that there's no such thing as aliens.

346
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,210
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are just weather balloons in tinfoil.

347
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:40,130
[SPEAKER_01]: Swamp gas.

348
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,950
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a real potty mouth tonight, you know that?

349
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,411
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your point?

350
00:19:44,311 --> 00:19:44,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

351
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:48,231
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I feel like I need to cleanse this with something pure.

352
00:19:48,251 --> 00:19:49,532
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to talk about a pure story for a minute.

353
00:19:49,552 --> 00:19:54,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, if they want to abduct someone, we have plenty of people in Hollywood that are completely useless.

354
00:19:54,553 --> 00:19:55,213
[SPEAKER_01]: Just take them.

355
00:19:55,813 --> 00:19:57,433
[SPEAKER_02]: We have plenty of people in Washington, D.C.

356
00:19:57,453 --> 00:19:58,393
[SPEAKER_02]: that are completely useless.

357
00:19:58,713 --> 00:19:58,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh!

358
00:19:59,214 --> 00:19:59,674
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

359
00:19:59,734 --> 00:20:00,754
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one on each coast.

360
00:20:00,974 --> 00:20:01,274
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

361
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:01,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

362
00:20:02,313 --> 00:20:07,754
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we need to cleanse Loki's potty mouth with a nice, pure, family-friendly story.

363
00:20:07,814 --> 00:20:08,894
[SPEAKER_02]: So... Grand Theft Auto?

364
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:09,315
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

365
00:20:11,215 --> 00:20:16,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Namco, Home Tech, bought the rights to a very famous comic strip this week.

366
00:20:17,736 --> 00:20:18,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Any thoughts?

367
00:20:18,737 --> 00:20:20,977
[SPEAKER_02]: When I say wholesome and pure comic strip, what do you think?

368
00:20:23,157 --> 00:20:23,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Blondie?

369
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:25,438
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

370
00:20:27,438 --> 00:20:30,019
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they bought the rights to The Peanuts.

371
00:20:30,752 --> 00:20:31,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's right.

372
00:20:31,752 --> 00:20:32,933
[SPEAKER_02]: The Charlie Brown gang.

373
00:20:33,153 --> 00:20:34,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Snoopy's really big.

374
00:20:35,074 --> 00:20:36,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Sanrio has a license for them, you know.

375
00:20:37,155 --> 00:20:50,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, Namco Home Tech announced that they are in agreement with United Media to create and publish games featuring characters from the Peanuts comic strip and all the other properties that go with that.

376
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,021
[SPEAKER_02]: The deal will be good through 2009.

377
00:20:52,141 --> 00:20:53,621
[SPEAKER_02]: No details revealed yet.

378
00:20:57,699 --> 00:20:59,560
[SPEAKER_02]: about any possible games that are coming out.

379
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,320
[SPEAKER_02]: But can you imagine some of the games that could come out for this?

380
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:04,681
[SPEAKER_02]: The Great Pumpkin.

381
00:21:05,962 --> 00:21:08,162
[SPEAKER_03]: This year, the Great Pumpkin's gonna visit me.

382
00:21:09,823 --> 00:21:11,203
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna wait here.

383
00:21:11,263 --> 00:21:17,085
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of Charlie Brown games would you like to see on a console?

384
00:21:17,465 --> 00:21:19,046
[SPEAKER_03]: It's your video game, Charlie Brown.

385
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:26,768
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see a football game where Charlie Brown finally gets to stick it to Lucy and just beat her ass.

386
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,332
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura knows what's coming up.

387
00:21:28,352 --> 00:21:33,073
[SPEAKER_02]: A very famous website is creating content specifically for viewing on your PSP.

388
00:21:35,134 --> 00:21:35,614
[SPEAKER_01]: The website...

389
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:08,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Playboy.com We'll be offering a science fiction themed pictorial of Amy Sue Cooper, who is the Playboy Cyber Girl of the Year 2005.

390
00:22:10,845 --> 00:22:12,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Cyber Girl of the Year.

391
00:22:13,726 --> 00:22:16,347
[SPEAKER_02]: This is content specifically for your PSP.

392
00:22:17,248 --> 00:22:20,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Two non-nude galleries and a video.

393
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:32,157
[SPEAKER_02]: are going to be available on Playboy.com however the nude content will only be available exclusively through the Cyber Club program

394
00:22:40,447 --> 00:22:41,148
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

395
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:58,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Really people, do you, it's just so pointless.

396
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:04,043
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, why do you need to download something you can see on your computer to your PSP?

397
00:23:04,403 --> 00:23:09,086
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's like, you know, they're like, well, we're releasing, you know, PSP formatted video.

398
00:23:09,406 --> 00:23:12,887
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you have to download the video from your computer to your PSP to watch it.

399
00:23:13,067 --> 00:23:19,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Because sometimes masturbation is not always something you do at the computer.

400
00:23:20,731 --> 00:23:22,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you want those pictures to go?

401
00:23:23,692 --> 00:23:24,033
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

402
00:23:24,193 --> 00:23:24,553
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

403
00:23:25,491 --> 00:23:26,352
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're into that.

404
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:28,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Assuming you're into that.

405
00:23:29,635 --> 00:23:30,756
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that we endorse that.

406
00:23:31,696 --> 00:23:32,477
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.

407
00:23:34,218 --> 00:23:41,704
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, but first off, folks, you're going to have to buy a larger memory card if you're going to want to do any of this crap to your PSP.

408
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:45,767
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, why waste the time?

409
00:23:46,028 --> 00:23:49,190
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, honestly, there's free porn out there.

410
00:23:49,771 --> 00:23:52,193
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all over the damn place.

411
00:23:52,373 --> 00:23:52,653
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean,

412
00:23:53,311 --> 00:23:54,912
[SPEAKER_01]: You really don't need to look far.

413
00:23:55,192 --> 00:23:59,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, DarkSakura says our PSP space is better spent on other downloads from the internet.

414
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:00,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what?

415
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:09,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you go to fans.gorillas.com on the news link, there is a little phrase there for the most recent update.

416
00:24:10,156 --> 00:24:15,978
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, for those of you with Sony PSPs, look for a very exclusive Gorillas download in the next 24 hours on this site.

417
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:19,339
[SPEAKER_03]: So that means by Saturday, which...

418
00:24:19,969 --> 00:24:23,652
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know when people are going to listen to this.

419
00:24:23,692 --> 00:24:27,495
[SPEAKER_02]: We're taping a couple days early, so Saturday will have already passed by the time people hear this.

420
00:24:27,515 --> 00:24:28,876
[SPEAKER_03]: There's downloadable content.

421
00:24:28,936 --> 00:24:32,759
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think that it would be either linked from the news site or from the multimedia link.

422
00:24:32,819 --> 00:24:36,062
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're a fan of that music group, The Gorillaz, who have a new album coming out soon, yes?

423
00:24:36,302 --> 00:24:36,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Next month.

424
00:24:36,762 --> 00:24:37,563
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, very cool.

425
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:38,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Demon Days.

426
00:24:38,203 --> 00:24:38,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Fangirl.

427
00:24:39,204 --> 00:24:39,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Fangirl.

428
00:24:39,885 --> 00:24:42,727
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully it will not suck like the Daft Punk.

429
00:24:43,512 --> 00:24:46,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Album Did, Prodigy, Crystal Method, Michael Jackson, Space Truckers

430
00:25:10,762 --> 00:25:15,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Halo 2 is going to have their brand new maps up on April 25th, so by the time most of you guys hear this, you'll be able to get this.

431
00:25:15,924 --> 00:25:20,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Two free maps are going to be available for download, Containment and Warlock.

432
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:36,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Containment is a snow-based level.

433
00:25:37,146 --> 00:25:40,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Warlock is influenced by the original Halo map, Wizard.

434
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:45,090
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can download two more maps called Turf and Sanctuary.

435
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:45,570
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be $6.

436
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:48,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Other maps are going to come on June 28th.

437
00:25:48,772 --> 00:25:51,893
[SPEAKER_02]: So for those of you guys playing Halo Online, this is kind of cool.

438
00:25:51,913 --> 00:25:54,054
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something, you know, kind of mixed up a little bit.

439
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:57,876
[SPEAKER_02]: So between the patch they just rolled out and this, you know, keeps Halo 2 fresh.

440
00:25:57,956 --> 00:25:58,537
[SPEAKER_02]: So good for them.

441
00:26:00,418 --> 00:26:03,419
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully none of those maps will suck as bad as the patch.

442
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:16,413
[SPEAKER_01]: Battle mode maps in the latest Mario Kart game, including the wonderful map that was a square, another map that was almost a square, Mario shaped square, and some other crappy ones.

443
00:26:17,714 --> 00:26:17,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

444
00:26:17,874 --> 00:26:18,454
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, that's alright.

445
00:26:18,754 --> 00:26:24,059
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope when their game patches, it patches better than Final Fantasy XI did this week, because oh my gosh.

446
00:26:24,239 --> 00:26:24,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Crap.

447
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,181
[SPEAKER_02]: I got so frustrated.

448
00:26:26,241 --> 00:26:31,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it has to do with those denial of service attacks that have been going on, but it took me

449
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:33,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

450
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's something else that's kind of interesting.

451
00:26:54,445 --> 00:26:59,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony Online Entertainment is going to be doing a new service called the Station Exchange.

452
00:27:00,029 --> 00:27:09,535
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is only rolling out for EverQuest 2, but what it is, this is very, very controversial, because the Station Exchange, this is something officially sanctioned by Sony, and guess what you do?

453
00:27:10,036 --> 00:27:13,138
[SPEAKER_02]: You can trade your items for real live money.

454
00:27:13,658 --> 00:27:15,960
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's basically endorsing...

455
00:27:16,897 --> 00:27:18,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Trading items for money in-game.

456
00:27:18,317 --> 00:27:20,258
[SPEAKER_03]: But they want to control it.

457
00:27:20,838 --> 00:27:21,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

458
00:27:21,358 --> 00:27:21,898
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to control it.

459
00:27:21,918 --> 00:27:23,378
[SPEAKER_03]: They probably have a way to make a profit on it.

460
00:27:23,838 --> 00:27:24,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, exactly.

461
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:25,279
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there's got to be.

462
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:27,119
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's interesting, though.

463
00:27:27,199 --> 00:27:30,780
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the very first time something like this has happened.

464
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,500
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think?

465
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Should the company be endorsing this kind of behavior?

466
00:27:35,761 --> 00:27:37,301
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing it to combat it.

467
00:27:38,061 --> 00:27:39,722
[SPEAKER_03]: The eBay-type sales.

468
00:27:41,222 --> 00:27:44,663
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably not going to do much good, but we'll see.

469
00:27:45,043 --> 00:27:45,583
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll never work.

470
00:27:45,922 --> 00:27:57,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the interesting thing is that they want to, and I think this is kind of clever, is that they're going to put the people who want to participate in this on separate servers than the people who don't want to participate in this.

471
00:27:58,207 --> 00:27:59,748
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's kind of interesting.

472
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:03,610
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's going to work, but it's interesting nonetheless.

473
00:28:06,571 --> 00:28:08,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting is a good word for it, yeah.

474
00:28:08,492 --> 00:28:12,114
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my issues with games like EverQuest 2 and World of Warcraft.

475
00:28:12,134 --> 00:28:12,494
[SPEAKER_01]: Please share.

476
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:15,467
[SPEAKER_01]: where you have like 90 billion servers out there.

477
00:28:16,308 --> 00:28:18,289
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these servers have player kills.

478
00:28:18,349 --> 00:28:20,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these servers are all-out war.

479
00:28:20,171 --> 00:28:21,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these servers are fun.

480
00:28:21,452 --> 00:28:24,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these servers have, you know, auction, blah, blah, blah.

481
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:25,616
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, really, I mean...

482
00:28:26,478 --> 00:28:30,080
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop trying to appease everyone, because there's people who are going to be pissed off no matter what.

483
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,421
[SPEAKER_01]: Just make a game that works.

484
00:28:33,022 --> 00:28:37,864
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these people are so lazy, they need a type of command to order online pizza!

485
00:28:38,185 --> 00:28:44,648
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of why I kind of like Final Fantasy XI, because it's like, who cares if you and the Japanese guy speak different languages?

486
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,349
[SPEAKER_02]: You play together, and you play nice.

487
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, it needs to be like that.

488
00:28:49,591 --> 00:28:55,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, back in the days of Ragnarok Online, when I was playing on the Korean servers, when I couldn't talk to anybody...

489
00:28:56,345 --> 00:28:59,427
[SPEAKER_03]: because, oh, I'm sorry, my laptop doesn't handle Korean.

490
00:29:00,327 --> 00:29:01,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not my laptop, but my keyboard.

491
00:29:01,868 --> 00:29:02,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

492
00:29:02,349 --> 00:29:04,730
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I was like, please speak English, please.

493
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:07,652
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I had to type in emotes and everything.

494
00:29:08,092 --> 00:29:15,537
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when I was playing on the American server, well, the international server for a while, though, they have, like, the every other country server now.

495
00:29:16,658 --> 00:29:21,100
[SPEAKER_03]: And you had to be a bit tolerant because you'd be dealing with people from all over the world.

496
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:21,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

497
00:29:21,981 --> 00:29:25,463
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had really weird food items in that game being a Korean game.

498
00:29:27,085 --> 00:29:27,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

499
00:29:28,085 --> 00:29:29,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to Rock was cool.

500
00:29:31,327 --> 00:29:34,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Except for all the... Help, please!

501
00:29:34,808 --> 00:29:36,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Spelled H-L-P-L-S.

502
00:29:36,089 --> 00:29:36,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all, please.

503
00:29:37,029 --> 00:29:37,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Port, please.

504
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:39,230
[SPEAKER_02]: P-L-Z.

505
00:29:40,991 --> 00:29:44,972
[SPEAKER_03]: I was hung out with this one priest who was really kind of pissy about the whole thing.

506
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:46,333
[SPEAKER_02]: God, you make it sound like real life.

507
00:29:47,794 --> 00:29:49,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, who's talking?

508
00:29:49,174 --> 00:29:50,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was hanging out with this priest.

509
00:29:51,866 --> 00:29:56,948
[SPEAKER_02]: We were questing together, we were like going out, we were clubbing, and then we walked into a bar.

510
00:29:58,668 --> 00:30:04,330
[SPEAKER_03]: There was this one person who was following us around the whole time, warped to Alberta or something.

511
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Canada?

512
00:30:07,251 --> 00:30:08,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like Canada.

513
00:30:08,791 --> 00:30:18,494
[SPEAKER_03]: So finally, the vine here opened a warp, and the person walked in, warped him to the haunted place.

514
00:30:19,674 --> 00:30:20,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Gas time.

515
00:30:20,435 --> 00:30:21,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the haunted place.

516
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:22,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

517
00:30:22,831 --> 00:30:23,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Mexico?

518
00:30:24,813 --> 00:30:25,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

519
00:30:25,734 --> 00:30:26,075
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

520
00:30:27,096 --> 00:30:27,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

521
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:31,161
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys ever have a comment on our show, we'd love to hear from you guys.

522
00:30:31,221 --> 00:30:34,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if you have any questions you want to ask us on the podcast, hey, why not?

523
00:30:34,464 --> 00:30:39,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Our email address, togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeloungeradio.com, all one word there.

524
00:30:40,031 --> 00:30:41,693
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our website where you're at it, orangeloungeradio.com.

525
00:30:42,914 --> 00:30:43,274
[SPEAKER_01]: That's scary.

526
00:30:43,354 --> 00:30:45,335
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be used against me if I run for president.

527
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:45,655
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.

528
00:30:45,675 --> 00:30:47,115
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saving one of our best stories here for the end.

529
00:31:09,947 --> 00:31:11,808
[SPEAKER_02]: New Zelda details.

530
00:31:11,888 --> 00:31:18,392
[SPEAKER_02]: The new Zelda game that's coming out on the Nintendo GameCube, which makes all the fanboys squee with glee about this one.

531
00:31:18,873 --> 00:31:19,253
[SPEAKER_02]: And girls.

532
00:31:21,454 --> 00:31:30,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Spanish games publication Javi Consolas has leaked some information about the new Zelda, or at least is putting information in their magazine.

533
00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:36,041
[SPEAKER_02]: They're basically saying that it's going to be a 70-hour game.

534
00:31:36,441 --> 00:31:37,281
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a long time.

535
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:41,383
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to be a world that's even bigger than Ocarina of Time.

536
00:31:42,543 --> 00:31:46,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Supposedly it's supposed to be about two or three times larger, in fact.

537
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:47,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.

538
00:31:47,945 --> 00:31:52,087
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the new outfits include Link being like a peasant style.

539
00:31:53,530 --> 00:32:01,732
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they even have some screenshots, one showing a Triforce that's kind of tattooed or emblazed on his hand.

540
00:32:02,072 --> 00:32:02,853
[SPEAKER_02]: So very interesting.

541
00:32:02,873 --> 00:32:05,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's because the Triforce was tattooed on his hand.

542
00:32:05,933 --> 00:32:08,694
[SPEAKER_02]: But just that amount of detail is very cool.

543
00:32:09,854 --> 00:32:11,055
[SPEAKER_01]: And he also becomes a ninja.

544
00:32:12,695 --> 00:32:14,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Curse you, Trogdor!

545
00:32:14,476 --> 00:32:15,516
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Ganon!

546
00:32:16,995 --> 00:32:21,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's, um, some villages that are like several zones big as well.

547
00:32:21,758 --> 00:32:27,482
[SPEAKER_02]: There was another demo where Link, uh, battles a horde of monsters while riding the horse.

548
00:32:28,062 --> 00:32:32,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you can choose between Link's sword or Link's bow to take down the riders.

549
00:32:32,625 --> 00:32:34,046
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, it's kind of neat.

550
00:32:34,106 --> 00:32:36,628
[SPEAKER_02]: And the bow no longer has an infinite range.

551
00:32:36,868 --> 00:32:38,309
[SPEAKER_02]: It only has a limited range on it.

552
00:32:38,349 --> 00:32:39,710
[SPEAKER_02]: So, interesting.

553
00:32:42,071 --> 00:32:44,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the Z targeting is back for the enemies.

554
00:32:44,413 --> 00:32:45,013
[SPEAKER_02]: They did mention that.

555
00:32:45,053 --> 00:32:45,694
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

556
00:32:46,154 --> 00:32:46,234
[SPEAKER_02]: So,

557
00:32:47,188 --> 00:32:47,708
[SPEAKER_02]: We shall see.

558
00:32:47,788 --> 00:32:52,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Except now, since GameCube doesn't really have a Z trigger, it's now L targeting.

559
00:32:52,729 --> 00:32:53,250
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the L button.

560
00:32:55,090 --> 00:33:02,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Lastly, for you guys tonight, a story about another GameCube game, and I know you guys are excited about this.

561
00:33:03,472 --> 00:33:08,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Namco has announced for the GameCube Hello Kitty Roller Rescue.

562
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:14,155
[SPEAKER_01]: Does she show me the 42 pressure points of death?

563
00:33:14,895 --> 00:33:15,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

564
00:33:15,675 --> 00:33:21,498
[SPEAKER_02]: However, she will be rendered in full 3D along with her Sanrio character friends.

565
00:33:21,978 --> 00:33:34,705
[SPEAKER_02]: In Roller Rescue, Hello Kitty and her friends must save Sanrio Town from an alien invasion because the king of the block planet, Blocko, is going to send troops to Earth to liberate.

566
00:33:34,725 --> 00:33:36,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop, stop, hold on a second.

567
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,706
[SPEAKER_01]: Blocko, wasn't that from Gumby?

568
00:33:39,327 --> 00:33:40,267
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, I don't know.

569
00:33:40,627 --> 00:33:41,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Those were the block heads.

570
00:33:42,233 --> 00:33:44,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Gumbi, Popeye, Peanuts, Hello Kitty

571
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:05,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but Sanrio already had licenses to... Oh my god.

572
00:34:05,917 --> 00:34:09,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, they need to do like a Super Smash Brothers with all these characters.

573
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,380
[SPEAKER_02]: I got it right now.

574
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,702
[SPEAKER_01]: Franchise fighting revolution.

575
00:34:12,942 --> 00:34:13,762
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you know what?

576
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:17,165
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get another Super Robot Wars starring Hello Kitty.

577
00:34:17,185 --> 00:34:25,691
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, they need to remake that game that was by Sega where you had like, you know, the Daytona car fighting a cactus fighting... Fighters Mega Mix.

578
00:34:25,751 --> 00:34:27,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Fighters Mega Mix.

579
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:27,772
[SPEAKER_01]: It was awesome.

580
00:34:27,872 --> 00:34:32,075
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all about playing with the two random Sonic fighters people.

581
00:34:33,261 --> 00:34:35,002
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have Fighters Megamix.

582
00:34:35,663 --> 00:34:36,083
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

583
00:34:37,124 --> 00:34:39,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's going to do it for another podcast.

584
00:34:39,065 --> 00:34:40,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Final thought, Loki?

585
00:34:41,406 --> 00:34:43,628
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to pack anymore.

586
00:34:46,009 --> 00:34:46,290
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut up.

587
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Packing, huh?

588
00:34:47,911 --> 00:34:49,272
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm packing boxes.

589
00:34:49,332 --> 00:34:56,316
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to fill them full of my wonderful computer parts and junk.

590
00:34:56,836 --> 00:34:58,778
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is beef.

591
00:35:00,179 --> 00:35:00,719
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.

592
00:35:01,423 --> 00:35:03,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Reject false icons.

593
00:35:04,264 --> 00:35:05,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Set Britney Spears on fire!

594
00:35:06,825 --> 00:35:09,105
[SPEAKER_02]: We will see you guys next time.

595
00:35:09,145 --> 00:35:10,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for listening.

596
00:35:10,466 --> 00:35:11,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for listening, guys.

597
00:35:11,366 --> 00:35:12,826
[SPEAKER_02]: We do appreciate you guys' support.

598
00:35:13,267 --> 00:35:15,307
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you next time on the Podcast.
