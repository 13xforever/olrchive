00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition week of April 25th, 2005.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Skye and Logan.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hello, good morning, afternoon or evening to you, whatever the case may be.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That's kind of the neat thing about podcasts is that you can listen to them whenever you feel like it.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Well, you are listening to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition,

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
your home for gamer chat and what gamers really want to know when you talk about games that don't suck.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
A couple that do sometimes.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Skye.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Joining me as always, my awesome co-hosts.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Say hello to Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Woo!

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Woo!

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Exciting. Exciting day, isn't it?

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Old.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Also with us, say hello to Loki.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hello.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hi, how you doing?

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm good.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Alright.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This is an interesting show because we're actually taping earlier in the week than we usually do.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We usually tape these podcasts on Sunday nights, but actually we're on Friday night right now.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This is the very last thing that we're recording in the old studio, so it should be very interesting.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's kind of freaky right now because the walls are bare and pretty much all that's left is DarkSakura's chair and all the microphones.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm actually packing during the show.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's amazing.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yes, we're being evicted as we speak. No.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm maintaining my current position.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The same position I always keep during the show, which is in this big comfy green thing.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
In your big comfy green chair.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yeah.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Alright. Anyway, let's start off talking about our own gaming week and then we'll get into some gaming news.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We've got a lot of interesting news tonight.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Starting off though, how was your gaming week?

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What kind of games have you been playing this week, DarkSakura?

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I finally played Luminous.

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Ooh, what'd you think?

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It was pretty fun. I like the music.

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I did the single player mode, which I got to level 13 on.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Because you start off picking your skin, so that's all I did.

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So you didn't play the mode where you progressed through the different skins, you just stuck with one.

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yeah, I picked one skin and got to level 13.

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That's cool.

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Now, I'll tell you, the weird thing about Luminous when you're playing that skin mode the first time where you're going through the different skins is you kind of don't expect it.

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So you're playing and then suddenly all the colors change and you're like, what the hell did I do? What did I do? Why is everything changing color?

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's kind of freaky.

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It does sound pretty freaky.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yeah.

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Apart from that, it was more widescreen pong and not a lot much else.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The usual webby games.

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yeah, I avoided the jeep simulator again because it really made me motion sick.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Is it just me or are we kind of a little bit of a dry spell right now?

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I mean, sure, there's some games, but we're kind of in a dry spell right now until E3. That's going to be like the big boom.

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm pissed off because Dan traded my copy of Dark Stalkers for stupid Midnight Club.

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What's Midnight Club? I don't even know.

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Racing.

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Dub edition. I think that's one of those games we don't talk about on the show usually.

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The last Midnight Club that I played, I cheated the hell out of it and we basically got this jet car type thing where we're just driving super fast around for no reason.

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Well, how was your gaming week since we're on you anyway?

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Ridge Racer. PSP. That is it.

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yeah, because you're in the middle of moving right now, so you're probably like me because when you hear about how my gaming week was, it's very similar.

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
No consoles this week really.

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I played Final Fantasy for all of one minute to log in to get the update and then, well obviously I didn't take a minute, but you know, logged in, said hi, and then logged out and that was it.

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And just now that Comcast is down, I can't play my online game.

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:54,000
No, so I've been playing a lot of PSP because I bring my PSP to work in my Tashi case, so it looks like I have a briefcase walking in, but it's actually my PSP.

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And then I play that during breaks and during lunch and whatnot.

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And so I've been playing a race here, race there, unlocking cars as I go along, and I'm actually pretty good at the game.

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I kind of have fishtail every now and then, but I'm getting the drifting down pretty good.

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Apparently I drift a lot because that's how you get the nitros in the game, so I get a lot of nitros.

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's pretty cool and I like how they have all the old tracks in it.

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Very cool. Have you heard about any new hacks on the PSP lately?

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What isn't there? Let's see, there's the hack where you can control your iTunes with your PSP.

74
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Oh, I read about that one too, I read about that.

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,000
There's the hack where you can control your house with the PSP, assuming you have a wired house, which all of five people have.

76
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
How many people our age have wired houses like that?

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I want one.

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Anyways, want and have are different things though.

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,000
PSP Tetris, but it's just online Tetris. All of them revolve around the browser hack and it's just all web applets, so it's really stupid.

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Suddenly, sales of Wipeout are incredibly popular.

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:11,000
MSN, or was it, yeah, Microsoft, their messenger is on PSP now, you can do that.

82
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Isn't that ironic?

83
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
However, I did see some pretty cool DS hacks that were kind of funny.

84
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:25,000
There's one where they ported, it's an actual emulator for your DS that emulates the TI-85.

85
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Like the graphing calculator?

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Uh-huh, the graphing calculator, and you use the touch screen to push the buttons and everything and it graphs and it's a calculator.

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:43,000
But what I think would be fun is to put the assembly programs for the graphing calculator onto the DS emulator and that's just way too complicated.

88
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You're talking about emulating an emulator, basically.

89
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Uh-huh.

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You're crazy.

91
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
That would be fun.

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But no, those are still coming out right now.

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:01,000
They're supposedly doing this thing on Engadget where they're supposed to be the best DS hack versus the best PSP hack.

94
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The PSP hacks so far have been pretty stupid, to be honest.

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I mean, there hasn't been really anything cool.

96
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:23,000
There's been one that I saw that was kind of neat where you can put an external antenna on your Wi-Fi because I guess there's a little cord inside there that's actually just a Wi-Fi antenna and you can just hook up a new antenna to the outside and extend your range for the Wi-Fi.

97
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But if you want to go crazy, you can do all the word driving stuff where you put a satellite dish attached to it and you can communicate with things thousands of feet away.

98
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Okay, that's a little much. I think you're going a little crazy there, people.

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:51,000
See, today I was locked out of my house for a little bit and I actually almost jumped on my neighbor's network to post online that I was locked out of my house on a live journal or something.

100
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But then my fiancé got there at the key, so I didn't get to.

101
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Alright. My gaming week was kind of very similar to yours because I'm also in the process of moving right now, obviously.

102
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So I don't really have any consoles hooked up right now, which is too bad because I wanted to check out how Halo 2 was going to be after the patches and I wanted to check out the brand new song pack that just came out for DDR UltraMix 2.

103
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What new song pack?

104
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yeah, there was a new song pack that came out out of nowhere on UltraMix 2.

105
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
What songs do they have in that?

106
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Waver-er and Love This Feelin' and I don't know.

107
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Waver-er?

108
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's like an old school song.

109
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Waver-er's from Silent Hill.

110
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yeah.

111
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Huh?

112
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Silent Hill 3.

113
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yeah.

114
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Why don't we talk about this on the normal show?

115
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I totally forgot.

116
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Oh.

117
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I didn't even know what songs that came out. I haven't really been surprised.

118
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Exclusive podcast material.

119
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Exclusive, yeah. You know, it's funny, ever since we made that change to saying we're not going to talk about rhythm and games, rhythm and music games so much on the podcast, it seems to be we get a story every week now.

120
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Oh well.

121
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yeah, song pack 10's out. Go check it out. A few UltraMix 2 bands.

122
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
But okay, so I've been wanting to play consoles, but I really just, you know, everything's in a box. I don't want to, you know, hook it up and play.

123
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So I've been playing DS. Instead of PSP, I've been playing DS.

124
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Mr. Driller. I strangely, for some reason when I first got my DS, I kind of plugged in the Metroid demo and then I went eh and put it away.

125
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I lost my demo.

126
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I put it back in and I'm playing the Metroid demo again. It's pretty cool. I'm looking forward to the full game.

127
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I've lost my demo.

128
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Which is weird. It's weird because I wasn't into Metroid first person on the GameCube, but for some reason on the DS, it doesn't bug me at all.

129
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I don't know if it's just because the controls are different.

130
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It hurts the hell out of my hand.

131
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Weird. I don't know.

132
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
My hand cramps up from playing that game. It's just because you have to hold it all weird and stuff.

133
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yeah.

134
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I just don't like it.

135
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Alright, let's get into some gaming news, shall we?

136
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Actually, I think what we'll do is start off with a Nintendo story.

137
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's actually a follow up to something we were talking about a few weeks ago on a previous podcast.

138
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Do you remember how I mentioned that an official Nintendo store is going to be opening up in New York City?

139
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yeah.

140
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Alright, well they set a date for that. It's going to be opening on May 14th.

141
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And as a reminder, that's going to be at Rockefeller Plaza in Midtown Manhattan.

142
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And basically what they're going to be doing, they're going to be having a huge party the opening day and giving away prizes.

143
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So if you're in the New York area, you might want to go check that out.

144
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That's Saturday, May 14th.

145
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And of course, the facility will also be the home of the Pokemon Trading Card Game League.

146
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Okay, that'll keep me away from that.

147
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
That and the fact that it's on the other side.

148
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Well, there'll be plenty more to do than just Pokemon. That's just one aspect of it.

149
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You'll walk in, you'll walk into the store, doo doo doo doo, seizure fever! Woo!

150
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Porygon!

151
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Moving on to news, something going on with the PSP.

152
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You know how we've been getting a lot of UMD movies here. It's starting to kind of pick up the format a little bit.

153
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Now, Bokeh, you're somebody who actually works in the distribution industry.

154
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yeah.

155
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Do you think UMDs are going to catch on?

156
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
They say they are.

157
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I think it's stupid, to be honest. I mean, I don't spend my money on fucking buying a portable system to bring games.

158
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Or, you know, if you're buying the games, why do you need the UMDs?

159
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I mean, you're never sitting down long enough to watch a whole freaking movie.

160
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And by the time you do, your battery's spent.

161
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Give me an idea of some new UMDs that are coming out pretty soon.

162
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Like, they have the House of Flying Daggers. They've got Triple X just came out.

163
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
There was Kill Bill Volume 1.

164
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
That's cool.

165
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Now, that was an exclusive, though. They oversold on that, actually, so we couldn't buy any.

166
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But Kill Bill Volume 1 is out there. Hellboy's coming out, I think.

167
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
See, now, what all these movies have in common is they're kind of like action and, you know, very action-oriented and blow-em-up kind of big films, right?

168
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Sort of.

169
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Well, the story I wanted to read for you guys is that actually in Japan, they're going to be getting some new UMD movies.

170
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
What kind of American movies do you think are coming out in Japan?

171
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Kill Bill?

172
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Hitch.

173
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Alright, here they are. Here's the movies that are coming out in Japan.

174
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
On June 22, Sony Pictures Entertainment is going to be releasing 13 Ghosts.

175
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You remember that movie? Had the chick from American Pie in it? Yeah, exactly.

176
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
13 Ghosts, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.

177
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
That's a good movie.

178
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And Charlie's Angels.

179
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm sorry.

180
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I can see where that would fly.

181
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Now, not the sequel, but the first one. Charlie's Angels, the first one.

182
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
The sequel sucked.

183
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Hey, get this. Get this.

184
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You got served.

185
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And that's exactly what I'm saying to the Japanese PSP audience right now with that release.

186
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
They're importing American games.

187
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yeah, isn't that weird?

188
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Because there's games here that aren't out there.

189
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Of course, they have packed picks already on DS.

190
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yeah, differences.

191
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Eh, eh.

192
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Alright, I just thought I'd share that.

193
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So, if you think the movies we're getting here are a little weird, just remember in Japan, they're getting You Got Served.

194
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm still waiting for Smart Bomb to come out.

195
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
What's that?

196
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's a puzzle game for the PSP.

197
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
There's a lot of puzzle games coming out.

198
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You got pushed back, though.

199
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's pretty cool. It's sort of like, uh, I don't really know how to describe it.

200
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's just a bunch of different puzzles.

201
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Maybe, like, if you slowed down WarioWare and had each puzzle last, like, a little longer.

202
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's like that.

203
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
We are getting so many puzzle games in the different handhelds.

204
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:14,000
On the PSP, Mercury just came out recently, Luminous, Colon, I might be mispronouncing that, but there's a new game coming out.

205
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
That's a puzzle game.

206
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Sticky Balls is another game that's coming out on PSP.

207
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Puzzle game.

208
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Smart Bomb.

209
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And that's the one you just mentioned.

210
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And then on the DS, we're getting Electroplankton, Meteos.

211
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Now, Electroplankton is not really a game.

212
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's just like, stuff happens.

213
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm going to have Electroplankton.

214
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm sorry.

215
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I actually, the early reviews I'm reading on it say that it might be a little bit overrated.

216
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's kind of interesting.

217
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
We don't know yet.

218
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I want to, I still want to see it myself.

219
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I played Seaman, okay?

220
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
She played Seaman.

221
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I used the American name, thank you.

222
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Moving on.

223
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
This was a really big story earlier this week.

224
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
This just happened the same day that our podcast went on the net.

225
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm kind of sad we didn't hit on it last week, but it's definitely worth mentioning.

226
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
If you haven't heard yet, GameStop just bought EB Games early this week.

227
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It was a big announcement that they made to the investors on Monday.

228
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Very interesting.

229
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
What do you think this is going to mean for the future?

230
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Basically the reason why they're doing this.

231
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
A lot of people see it as GameStop is buying their biggest competitor, but you have to think of it this way.

232
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
The biggest competitor, really, is Walmart.

233
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
That's their biggest competitor.

234
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So what's happening is that GameStop and EB are kind of teaming up to take on Walmart, which I think is very interesting.

235
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And those very big super vendors, Best Buys and Targets, things like that as well.

236
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
What do you think of this?

237
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
When evil has purchased the greater evil.

238
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And in other news, service still sucks.

239
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:59,000
What's interesting, if you take polls, if you go to different internet forums, because every gaming forum is lit up on this topic.

240
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's like, it depends on the area you live, whether the EB store is better or the GameStop store is better.

241
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And I think somebody was joking on the three hour show this week that it's like the red states and the blue states.

242
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It just depends on your neck of the woods, which store is better.

243
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
So people are very, you know, it's almost like half and half.

244
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Yeah.

245
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
They both suck.

246
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:34,000
They really, they both do. I mean, I went to the mall, Arden mall, and they had like, you know, you know, I asked, do you have any PSPs?

247
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
No, you're never going to find one.

248
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yeah.

249
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And went to GameStop, you know, they gave me the same spiel with the Best Buy.

250
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Oh, look, there's a pile of them.

251
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Yeah, they've got them at Dan's store.

252
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
There you go.

253
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So I said, fuck you people, you suck.

254
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's because you went to the mall.

255
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I know, I was over there.

256
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
All right. The Nintendo DS.

257
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
This is no surprise. What new story?

258
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
If I said Nintendo was launching a brand new peripheral, what do you think it is?

259
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Here in the US, finally.

260
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
They already had it in Japan.

261
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Is it something that you can buy over and over and over again and still be suckered into buying another?

262
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yes, yes.

263
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Would it be a new color?

264
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Yes, a new color to the Nintendo DS.

265
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Dude, I want that graphite colored one. That one's cool.

266
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Well, this is the interesting thing. Here in the US, we're only getting the blue one right now.

267
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Yeah.

268
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
So, we do have the titanium one as well, but there's going to be the blue one coming out.

269
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
People, I just want you to know something.

270
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
There's actually a website out there. Now, I don't remember the exact website URL.

271
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Well, what a useful tip this is.

272
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Oh, shut up. Anyways, you know, it's basically you can get your Xbox, your PlayStation 2,

273
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:03,000
your, you know, DS or your, you know, Game Boy SP or whatever in any color you want.

274
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You don't have to buy from Nintendo. You don't have to wait for them to come out with another color.

275
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Those crappy stickers that you put on?

276
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
No. Custom paint jobs.

277
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Oh, gosh. Pimp my DS. Is that what this is?

278
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Dude, maybe I can have camo.

279
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:26,000
But you can design, you can select which color. Like, for the Xbox and PS2 systems, they come with controllers that match.

280
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
But, it's like, seriously, people, you don't have to...

281
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
This is something I would be expecting, like, you know, Paris Hilton to buy a system to match her purse or something.

282
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
She did buy a PSP.

283
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Oh, shut up.

284
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
She probably went and had that gem-crusting done to it, too.

285
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Um, also in June, when the blue DS comes out, Nintendo's gonna be putting out some DS games! Yay!

286
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Some pretty neat ones at that.

287
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Meteos. Meteos is one of them coming out in June.

288
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And Kirby Canvas Curse, which, you know, implies it's gonna be a Kirby game that uses a stylus.

289
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Big surprise, huh?

290
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
When are we getting Mario Paint DS?

291
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I don't know. I don't know.

292
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
That's what I want.

293
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
That would make sense.

294
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Alright, well, there's the game in WarioWare, the mini-game.

295
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Yeah, I know it's not the same.

296
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Yeah, but nothing beats a gelatin game.

297
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
The gelatin game is the best.

298
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Alright, Orange Lounge Radio, we're not just here to talk about games, because if we talked about games all day long,

299
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
we'd have no time to go terrorize children at the local arcade.

300
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:43,000
So, we're here to better your life, and what way to better your life than to allow our very own Dark Sakura to give you her advice column?

301
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Oh, joy.

302
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
She's enthused about her own column.

303
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
What advice do you have for us tonight, Dark Sakura?

304
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I don't think enthused is a word.

305
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Whatever. Way to go, Grammar.

306
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Alright, thank you for that advice column!

307
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
We'll just end that segment.

308
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You know what? I have a ferret.

309
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Alright, what's the advice column about tonight?

310
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
How to foil a UFO abduction.

311
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Number one, do not panic.

312
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:20,000
The extraterrestrial biological entity, or EBE, may sense your fear and act rashly.

313
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Two, control your thoughts.

314
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Do not think of anything violent or upsetting.

315
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
The EBE may have the ability to read your mind.

316
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Try to avoid mental images of abduction, boarding the saucer, or anal probes.

317
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Such images may encourage you to...

318
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I knew anal probe would come up somewhere in this.

319
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Three, resist verbally.

320
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Firmly tell the EBE to leave you alone.

321
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Four, resist...

322
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
No means no!

323
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Resist mentally.

324
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Picture yourself enveloped in a protective shield of white light, or in a safe place.

325
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Telepathic EBEs may get the message.

326
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Five, resist physically.

327
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Physical resistance should only be used as a last resort.

328
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Go for the EBE's eyes if it has any.

329
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You will not know what its other, more sensitive areas are.

330
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
But my final advice?

331
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Yes.

332
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Don't live in the Midwest.

333
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Alright, my final advice is, holy shit, if there's a fucking alien coming after you,

334
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
honestly, poking in the eye is gonna piss the fucker off.

335
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And if I were the alien, and because basically the aliens would look at us like bugs,

336
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I would throw you across the fucking room, smash you into a wall or something.

337
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I mean, seriously, they could probably just crack you in half, I mean...

338
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Besides, we know that there's no such thing as aliens.

339
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Those are just weather balloons in tinfoil.

340
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Swamp gas.

341
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You got a real potty mouth tonight, you know that?

342
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
What's your point?

343
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Moving on.

344
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
In fact, I feel like I need to cleanse this with something pure.

345
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
So we're gonna talk about a pure story for a minute.

346
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Honestly, if they wanna abduct someone, we have plenty of people in Hollywood that are

347
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
completely useless.

348
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Just take them.

349
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
We have plenty of people in Washington, D.C. that are completely useless.

350
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Oh!

351
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
There you go!

352
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's one on each coast.

353
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Alright, anyway.

354
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I feel like we need to cleanse Loki's potty mouth with a nice, pure, family-friendly story.

355
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
So...

356
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Grand Theft Auto?

357
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
No.

358
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Namco, home tech, bought the rights to a very famous comic strip this week.

359
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Any thoughts?

360
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
When I say wholesome and pure comic strip, what do you think?

361
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Blondie?

362
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
No.

363
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
No, they've bought the rights to the Peanuts.

364
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Oh, that's right.

365
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
The Charlie Brown gang.

366
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Well, Snoopy's really big and Sanrio has a license for them, you know.

367
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Yeah, well.

368
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Namco home tech announced that they are in agreement with United Media to create and

369
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
publish games featuring characters from the Peanuts comic strip and all the other properties

370
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
that go with that.

371
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
The deal will be good through 2009.

372
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
No details revealed yet about any possible games that are coming out, but can you imagine

373
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
some of the games that could come out for this?

374
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
The Great Pumpkin.

375
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
This year, The Great Pumpkin's gonna visit me!

376
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm gonna wait here.

377
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,000
What kind of Charlie Brown games would you like to see on a console?

378
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It's your video game, Charlie Brown!

379
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I want to see a football game where Charlie Brown finally gets to stick it to Lucy and

380
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
just beat her ass, because you know how she would never let him kick the damn football?

381
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Stick it to Lucy and beat her ass.

382
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
That sounds like a whole different game to me.

383
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,000
In fact, that might tie into our next story.

384
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Dark Sakura knows what's coming up.

385
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:55,000
A very famous website is creating content specifically for viewing on your PSP.

386
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
The website?

387
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Playboy.com.

388
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:07,000
We'll be offering a science fiction themed pictorial of Amy Sue Cooper, who is the Playboy

389
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Cyber Girl of the Year 2005.

390
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Cyber Girl of the Year.

391
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
This is content specifically for your PSP.

392
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Two non-nude galleries and a video are gonna be available on Playboy.com.

393
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:33,000
However, the nude content will only be available exclusively through the Cyber Club program.

394
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Is any nerd out there gonna actually pay for porn?

395
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Come on, there's so much free porn out there that you can simply down-

396
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
People had free porn on their PSP the first day.

397
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Exactly, they all need Playboy.

398
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:53,000
See, this is just like that stupid iPod crap with the iPod picture or whatever the hell it's called.

399
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
iPod photo or whatever.

400
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Really, people?

401
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
It's just so pointless.

402
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Why do you need to download something you can see on your computer to your PSP?

403
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I mean, they're like, well, we're releasing PSP formatted video.

404
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Yeah, you have to download the video from your computer to your PSP to watch it.

405
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Because sometimes masturbation is not always something you do at the computer.

406
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Don't you want those pictures to go?

407
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
No.

408
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I don't know.

409
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
If you're into that.

410
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
There's better things to download.

411
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Assuming you're into that.

412
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Not that we endorse that.

413
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
There's better things to download than your PSP.

414
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Oh, man.

415
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I'm sorry, but first off, folks, I mean, you're gonna have to buy a larger memory card if you're gonna want to do any of this crap to your PSP.

416
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Really, why waste the time?

417
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I mean, honestly, there's free porn out there.

418
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It's all over the damn place.

419
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I mean, you really don't need to look far.

420
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Alright, DarkSakura says our PSP space is better spent on other downloads from the internet. Like what?

421
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Like if you go to fans.gorillas.com on the news link, there is a little phrase there for the most recent update.

422
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
It says, for those of you with Sony PSPs, look for a very exclusive Gorillas download in the next 24 hours on this site.

423
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:24,000
So that means by Saturday, which I don't know when people are gonna listen to this, but Saturday there's going to be...

424
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Maybe a couple days early, so Saturday will have already passed by the time people hear this.

425
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
There's downloadable content. I would think that it would be either linked from the news site or from the multimedia link.

426
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
So if you're a fan of that music group, the Gorillas, who have a new album coming out soon, yes?

427
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Next month.

428
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Alright, very cool.

429
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Demon Days.

430
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Fangirl. Fangirl.

431
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Hopefully it will not suck like the Def Punk album did or the Prodigy album.

432
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Ah, the tracks I've heard so far are pretty good.

433
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Or the Crystal Method album.

434
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I've heard the entire thing and it's brilliant.

435
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Or the Michael Jackson album.

436
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Hey, it has Dennis Hopper speaking on it. How cool is that?

437
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
And that song is freaking awesome.

438
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Dennis Hopper? Dude, that guy's awesome.

439
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
See?

440
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
He was in a movie called... wait, Dennis Hopper. Yeah, that's the same Dennis Hopper.

441
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
He was in a movie called Space Truckers. I actually watched that movie. It was boring.

442
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Hello, gamer chat. Hello.

443
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Dennis Hopper's awesome.

444
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Alright.

445
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Space Truckers.

446
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Moving on, moving back.

447
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Halo 2. A story you guys always love to talk about, so I'll make this quick.

448
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Halo 2 is going to have their brand new maps up on April 25th.

449
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
So by the time most of you guys hear this, you'll be able to get this.

450
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Two free maps are going to be available for download.

451
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Containment and Warlock.

452
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Containment is a snow-based level.

453
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Warlock is influenced by the original Halo map, Wizard.

454
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
And then you can download two more maps called Turf and Sanctuary.

455
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
It's going to be six bucks.

456
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Other maps are going to come on June 28th.

457
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
So for those of you guys playing Halo online, this is kind of cool.

458
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
This is something, you know, kind of mixed up a little bit.

459
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
So between the patch they just rolled out and this, you know, keeps Halo 2 fresh.

460
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
So good for them.

461
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Hopefully none of those maps will suck as bad as the Battle Mode maps in the latest Mario Kart game.

462
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Including the wonderful map that was a square.

463
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Another map that was, like, almost a square. Mario shaped square.

464
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
And some other crappy ones.

465
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Sorry.

466
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
That's alright.

467
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And I hope when their game patches, it patches better than Final Fantasy XI did this week.

468
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Because, oh my gosh.

469
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Crap.

470
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I got so frustrated.

471
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I don't know if it has to do with those Denial of Service attacks that have been going on.

472
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
But it took me two days to patch.

473
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It was horrible.

474
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I connected, I started in the morning.

475
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
It didn't work.

476
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I logged on later on at, like, 10 p.m.

477
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
And it was still backed up there.

478
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I was like, what the hell?

479
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
This is retarded.

480
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Finally downloaded, and guess what?

481
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
It's more crap that I can't use yet.

482
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Here's something else that's kind of interesting.

483
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Sony Online Entertainment is going to be doing a new service called the Station Exchange.

484
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And this is only rolling out for EverQuest 2.

485
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
But what it is, this is very, very controversial.

486
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Because the Station Exchange, this is something officially sanctioned by Sony.

487
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And guess what you do?

488
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
You can trade your items for real live money.

489
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
So it's basically endorsing trading items for money in-game.

490
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
But they want to control it.

491
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Exactly.

492
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
They want to control it.

493
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
They probably have a way to make a profit on it.

494
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Oh, exactly.

495
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I'm sure there's got to be.

496
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
So it's interesting, though.

497
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
This is the very first time something like this has happened.

498
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
What do you guys think?

499
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Is this, should the company be endorsing this kind of behavior?

500
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
They're doing it to combat it, the eBay-type sales.

501
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
It's probably not going to do much good, but we'll see.

502
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
It'll never work.

503
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Well, the interesting thing is that they want to,

504
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
and I think this is kind of clever,

505
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
is that they're going to put the people who want to participate in this

506
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
on separate servers than the people who don't want to participate in this.

507
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
So I think that's kind of interesting.

508
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I don't know if that's going to work, but it's interesting nonetheless.

509
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Interesting is a good word for it, yeah.

510
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I have my issues with games like EverQuest 2 and World of Warcraft

511
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
where you have like 90 billion servers out there.

512
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Some of these servers have player kills.

513
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Some of these servers are all-out war.

514
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Some of these servers are fun.

515
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Some of these servers have auction, blah, blah, blah.

516
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
It's like really, I mean, stop trying to appease everyone

517
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
because there's people going to be pissed off no matter what.

518
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Just make a game that works.

519
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
That's one thing I do kind of.

520
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Some of these people are so lazy they need a type of command

521
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
to order online pizza.

522
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
That's kind of why I kind of like Final Fantasy XI

523
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
because it's like who cares if you and the Japanese guy

524
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
speak different languages.

525
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
You play together and you play nice.

526
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Seriously, it needs to be like that.

527
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Well, back in the days of Ragnarok Online

528
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
when I was playing on the Korean servers

529
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
and I couldn't talk to anybody because,

530
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
oh, I'm sorry, my laptop doesn't handle Korean.

531
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Well, not my laptop, but my keyboard.

532
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I was like, please speak English, please.

533
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And then now you type in emotes and everything.

534
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
And then when I was playing on the American server,

535
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
well, the international server for a while though,

536
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
they have like the every other country server now

537
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
and you had to be a bit tolerant

538
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
because you'd be dealing with people from all over the world.

539
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Exactly.

540
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And they had really weird food items in that game

541
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
being at a Korean game.

542
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Moving on.

543
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Back in the Rock was cool.

544
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Except for all the hell please spelled H-L-P-L-S.

545
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Hell please, port please, P-L-Z.

546
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I hung out with this one priest

547
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
who was really kind of pissy about the whole thing.

548
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
God, you make it sound like real life.

549
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Okay, who was talking about it?

550
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Yeah, I was hanging out with this priest.

551
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
We were questing together.

552
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
We were like going out.

553
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
We were clubbing and then we walked into a bar.

554
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
There was this one person who was following us around the whole time

555
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
warped to Alberta or something.

556
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Like Canada?

557
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Yeah, like Canada.

558
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
So finally, fine, here, opened a warp

559
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,000
and the person walked in, warped into the haunted place.

560
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Gas time.

561
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Not the haunted place.

562
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Yeah.

563
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Mexico?

564
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Anyway.

565
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
No.

566
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Moving on.

567
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
If you guys ever have a comment on our show,

568
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
we'd love to hear from you guys.

569
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Also, if you have any questions you want to ask us on the podcast,

570
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
hey, why not?

571
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Our email address, togo, T-O-G-O at orangeloungeradio.com.

572
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
All one word there.

573
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
This is our website where you're at at orangeloungeradio.com.

574
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Exactly.

575
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
We never get that much mail

576
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
and I try to piss them off every week

577
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
and no one says they hate mail.

578
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I know.

579
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
No one loves us.

580
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I'm really starting to wonder.

581
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
And I know people are listening to this show

582
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
because I've looked at the stats.

583
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
More people listen to this than listen to our live station.

584
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
So, we know you're out there.

585
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
That's scary.

586
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
This is going to be used against me if I run for president.

587
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Oh, that's funny.

588
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
People with iPods.

589
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I'm saving one of our best stories here for the end.

590
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
New Zelda details.

591
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
The new Zelda game that's coming out on the Nintendo GameCube,

592
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
which makes all the fanboys squee with glee about this one.

593
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
And girls.

594
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Spanish games publication, Jabi Consolas,

595
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
has leaked some information about the new Zelda,

596
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
or at least, you know, is putting information in their magazine.

597
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
They're basically saying that it's going to be a 70-hour game.

598
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
That's a long time.

599
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
It's supposed to be a world that's even bigger than Ocarina of Time.

600
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Supposedly, it's supposed to be about two or three times larger, in fact.

601
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Very interesting.

602
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
And some of the new outfits include Link being, like, a peasant style.

603
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
And then they even have some screenshots,

604
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:02,000
one showing, like, a Triforce that's kind of tattooed or emblazed on his hand.

605
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
So, very interesting.

606
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Well, that's because the Triforce was tattooed on his hand.

607
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
But just that amount of detail is very, you know, very cool.

608
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
And he also becomes a ninja.

609
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Curse you, Trogdor.

610
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I mean, Ganon.

611
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
There's some villages that are, like, several zones big as well.

612
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
There was another demo where Link battles a horde of monsters

613
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
while riding the horse.

614
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
You can choose between Link's sword or Link's bow to take down the riders.

615
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
So, it's kind of neat.

616
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
And the bow no longer has an infinite range.

617
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
It only has a limited range on it.

618
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
So, interesting.

619
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
The Z-targeting is back for the enemies.

620
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
They did mention that.

621
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
That's awesome.

622
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
So, we shall see.

623
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Except now, since GameCube doesn't really have a Z-trigger,

624
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
it's now L-targeting.

625
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
It's the L button.

626
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Lastly, for you guys tonight,

627
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
a story about another GameCube game,

628
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
and I know you guys are excited about this.

629
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Namco has announced, for the GameCube,

630
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Hello Kitty Roller Rescue.

631
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Does she show me the 42 pressure points of death?

632
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I don't think so.

633
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
However, she will be rendered in full 3D

634
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
along with her Sanrio character friends.

635
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
In Roller Rescue, Hello Kitty and her friends

636
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
must save Sanrio Town from an alien invasion

637
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
because the king of the block planet, Blocko,

638
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
is going to send troops to Earth to liberate.

639
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Stop. Stop. Hold on a second.

640
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Blocko, wasn't that from Gumby?

641
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I don't know. I don't know.

642
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Those were the block heads.

643
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Whatever. It's all the same.

644
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Hello Kitty will be joined by 20 other Sanrio characters,

645
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
including my favorite, that's Maru, and Karopi.

646
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
You know, I bet if they're going to be aliens

647
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
then we're going to have the twin stars.

648
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
This is interesting because if you think about it now,

649
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Namco has Gumby, Popeye, Peanuts, and Hello Kitty.

650
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Yeah, but Sanrio already had licenses to do.

651
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Oh my god. They need to do like a Super Smash Brothers

652
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
with all these characters.

653
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I got it right now.

654
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Franchise fighting revolution.

655
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
You know what, we're going to get another Super Robot Wars

656
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
starring Hello Kitty.

657
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Oh my god, they need to remake that game that was by Sega

658
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
where you had like the Daytona car fighting a cactus fighting.

659
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Fighters Megamix.

660
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Yeah, Fighters Megamix.

661
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
It was all about playing with the two random Sonic fighters people.

662
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Alright.

663
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I actually have Fighters Megamix.

664
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
That's cool.

665
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000

00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Final thought, Loki.

667
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I don't want to pack anymore.

668
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Shut up.

669
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Packing, huh?

670
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I'm packing boxes, I need to, you know,

671
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:57,000
fill them full of my wonderful computer parts and junk.

672
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
My final thought is beef.

673
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Dark Sakura.

674
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Reject false icons.

675
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Set Britney Spears on fire.

676
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000

Watch Robot Chicken.

682
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.
