[SPEAKER_04]: Arrrr!

36
00:05:12,835 --> 00:05:14,395
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, because you do pirate-like things.

37
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:16,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you're always chasing the booty, that's why.

38
00:05:18,036 --> 00:05:18,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

39
00:05:19,557 --> 00:05:20,217

00:05:21,037 --> 00:05:21,477

43
00:05:28,823 --> 00:05:33,684
[SPEAKER_04]: who's feeling as angel as always, I guess, I don't know, and brought me taffy, which is awesome.

44
00:05:33,704 --> 00:05:36,345
[SPEAKER_13]: You want some, too?

45
00:05:36,945 --> 00:05:42,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Better hurry up and eat some, because I'm, like, porking through all this taffy, I'm like, food, candy, sugar, it's yummy.

46
00:05:42,386 --> 00:05:45,846
[SPEAKER_19]: It's okay, Magus decided to steal some last night while I went to bed anyway.

47
00:05:46,327 --> 00:05:53,548
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm like, okay, I'm going to bed, next thing you know, I, uh, yesterday, or, I mean, this morning, I looked in the bag, I'm like, damn it, half of it's gone!

48
00:05:55,182 --> 00:05:57,311
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what happens when you put taffy in front of people.

49
00:05:57,371 --> 00:05:59,319
[SPEAKER_04]: It disappears because taffy is yummy.

50
00:06:01,917 --> 00:06:04,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Anywho, we should have a heck of a show for you guys tonight.

51
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:10,021
[SPEAKER_04]: We found the sound clip we wanted to play very badly for you guys last week.

52
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:14,364
[SPEAKER_04]: We played it about a year ago, which is a little bit of a hint as to what it is.

53
00:06:14,764 --> 00:06:20,007
[SPEAKER_04]: We were talking about a little something something last week, and we finally found the sound clip of it to play tonight.

54
00:06:20,507 --> 00:06:21,648
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's wonderful.

55
00:06:21,668 --> 00:06:22,548
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to play it for you.

56
00:06:22,568 --> 00:06:24,949
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope it doesn't have me saying anything, you know.

57
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,271
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's actually not a sound clip of you.

58
00:06:28,311 --> 00:06:31,373
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a sound clip of somebody not even on this show, but that's what makes it funny.

59
00:06:32,982 --> 00:06:34,604
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll discuss what that is in a little bit, don't worry.

60
00:06:35,725 --> 00:06:36,025
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

61
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,086
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you a hint during break.

62
00:06:37,907 --> 00:06:38,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

63
00:06:39,408 --> 00:06:41,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of break, let's get to it.

64
00:06:42,071 --> 00:06:44,893
[SPEAKER_04]: In this break, some random music.

65
00:06:44,913 --> 00:06:47,756
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start it off with a little bit of French counting.

66
00:06:48,297 --> 00:06:52,060
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to learn how to count to three, just listen very carefully to the lyrics of the song.

67
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:55,323
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

68
00:06:55,423 --> 00:06:55,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy!

69
00:07:26,992 --> 00:07:28,013

Thanks for watching!

71
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:42,130
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura.com

72
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:46,125
[SPEAKER_13]: Fly away, to fantasy, spinning round, instantly, a day will wait.

73
00:13:10,645 --> 00:13:26,360
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.

74
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:30,904
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to

75
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:39,828
[SPEAKER_04]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 138, in progress here on this lovely April night.

76
00:13:40,628 --> 00:13:42,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Hope you guys had an interesting April Fool's Day.

77
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,212
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there were a lot of interesting pranks that were played out there by some various websites.

78
00:13:46,712 --> 00:13:53,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, one of the biggest sites I'm sure most of us who listen to this program visit once in a while, the DDR Freak.

79
00:13:53,897 --> 00:13:54,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

80
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,604
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, given the, why am I so loud?

81
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:18,185
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

82
00:14:18,445 --> 00:14:25,349
[SPEAKER_21]: Given the issue with last year, I just sort of sat back and let everybody else do their thing, and I was like, I'm not even gonna.

83
00:14:25,809 --> 00:14:34,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, like, last year was a lot, and I couldn't believe some of the response the joke was getting on DDR Freak, because people were like, oh, this is, this sucks compared to last year.

84
00:14:35,395 --> 00:14:36,876
[SPEAKER_34]: Last year was funny, blah, blah, blah.

85
00:14:37,182 --> 00:14:40,103
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going like, okay, last year was like too much.

86
00:14:40,604 --> 00:14:42,805
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, you cannot outdo what they did last year.

87
00:14:43,585 --> 00:14:46,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what happened last year was like over the top.

88
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:53,409
[SPEAKER_21]: Last year, the best part about it was actually getting everything that led up to April Fool's Day.

89
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:58,972
[SPEAKER_21]: Because we were all going, becoming power hungry, egomaniac.

90
00:14:59,352 --> 00:15:02,053
[SPEAKER_04]: It was basically wrestling drama.

91
00:15:02,073 --> 00:15:02,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

92
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:07,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, it was like you all got to be WWE members for a minute.

93
00:15:07,513 --> 00:15:13,577
[SPEAKER_21]: We were all like, screw y'all, we are all admins and we are going to just take over the whole page.

94
00:15:14,437 --> 00:15:22,122
[SPEAKER_21]: And then all chaos broke loose on New Year's.

95
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:24,203
[SPEAKER_21]: The new revolution, oh yeah!

96
00:15:24,464 --> 00:15:26,345
[SPEAKER_21]: I swear it's Daylight Savings Time if I can win my head.

97
00:15:27,446 --> 00:15:29,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I have a lot to say about Daylight Savings Time in a little bit.

98
00:15:30,354 --> 00:15:33,395
[SPEAKER_21]: But seriously though, last year was so much fun.

99
00:15:33,435 --> 00:15:37,316
[SPEAKER_21]: This year I'm like, nothing will ever be what last year was.

100
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,057
[SPEAKER_21]: So I just sat back and let it happen.

101
00:15:39,517 --> 00:15:40,517
[SPEAKER_21]: This is your puppy.

102
00:15:41,178 --> 00:15:42,278
[SPEAKER_21]: You can put it in town if you want.

103
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:47,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's saying that it doesn't top last year and it wasn't funny and it wasn't creative and it was too obvious.

104
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:57,002
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think what people don't get is that the actual joke was not the fact that DDR Freak was going to turn into In The Groove Freak.

105
00:15:57,042 --> 00:15:58,543
[SPEAKER_04]: The joke was that...

106
00:15:59,412 --> 00:16:02,633
[SPEAKER_04]: It was something that they really were going to add to the site and keep.

107
00:16:03,373 --> 00:16:05,513
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was kind of like one of those not a joke jokes.

108
00:16:05,533 --> 00:16:06,234
[SPEAKER_13]: Got you twice.

109
00:16:06,554 --> 00:16:06,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of.

110
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:07,734
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how to put it.

111
00:16:08,714 --> 00:16:09,494
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was funny.

112
00:16:10,775 --> 00:16:13,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Now everybody knows I was a very vocal critic of last year's joke.

113
00:16:13,995 --> 00:16:15,396
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not enjoy last year's joke.

114
00:16:15,436 --> 00:16:17,576
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was way over the top and not necessary.

115
00:16:18,957 --> 00:16:20,677
[SPEAKER_04]: So I much preferred this year's joke.

116
00:16:21,997 --> 00:16:26,058
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll tell you what, part of the joke was getting the angry reactions.

117
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:27,839
[SPEAKER_21]: That was part of the good thing.

118
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:28,979
[SPEAKER_21]: No offense.

119
00:16:29,306 --> 00:16:29,726
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's alright.

120
00:16:31,827 --> 00:16:33,227
[SPEAKER_04]: But last year's joke was stupid.

121
00:16:33,588 --> 00:16:36,809
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm glad that this year's joke was a little more tame and kind of funny.

122
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:37,849
[SPEAKER_21]: Good thing we didn't do anything.

123
00:16:37,869 --> 00:16:38,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

124
00:16:38,609 --> 00:16:41,090
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad we decided to stay out of the April Fool's thing.

125
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, I don't think April Fool's is that funny at all.

126
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:43,471
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

127
00:16:43,531 --> 00:16:44,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.

128
00:16:44,472 --> 00:16:45,052
[SPEAKER_21]: Boycott it.

129
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:46,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh.

130
00:16:47,253 --> 00:16:48,373
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, where was I?

131
00:16:48,553 --> 00:16:48,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.

132
00:16:50,974 --> 00:16:51,595
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not surprised at all.

133
00:16:51,615 --> 00:16:51,995
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, after all.

134
00:16:52,015 --> 00:16:52,115
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

135
00:16:52,135 --> 00:16:52,475
[SPEAKER_04]: No, seriously.

136
00:16:52,495 --> 00:16:53,176
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got... You have my...

137
00:17:21,005 --> 00:17:22,006
[SPEAKER_21]: Gorgeous voice.

138
00:17:23,026 --> 00:17:27,689
[SPEAKER_21]: We have our violent and angry young man here.

139
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,130
[SPEAKER_21]: And then we have you.

140
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and then there's the gay.

141
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:34,273
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, and then we have the gay.

142
00:17:36,074 --> 00:17:38,776
[SPEAKER_21]: But, I don't know, I'm not surprised at all.

143
00:17:38,796 --> 00:17:40,036
[SPEAKER_21]: We put enough work into this.

144
00:17:40,817 --> 00:17:42,758
[SPEAKER_21]: We deserve our kudos, damn it.

145
00:17:44,642 --> 00:17:48,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you for being so humble about everything.

146
00:17:48,805 --> 00:17:49,526
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.

147
00:17:49,546 --> 00:17:50,767
[SPEAKER_21]: We are fucking celebrities.

148
00:17:52,168 --> 00:17:53,569
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, the internet loves us.

149
00:17:56,651 --> 00:18:01,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, in all reality, I'm going to come down to, you know, planet Earth here.

150
00:18:01,334 --> 00:18:02,395
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know where Jamie's at right now.

151
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:03,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to come down to planet Earth here.

152
00:18:04,737 --> 00:18:05,818
[SPEAKER_07]: The Earth is beneath me.

153
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:07,899
[SPEAKER_07]: I am on the moon now.

154
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Screw you guys.

155
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:14,127
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's just funny to see everybody that's nominated for Broadcaster of the Year.

156
00:18:14,147 --> 00:18:17,249
[SPEAKER_04]: And you've got some really freaking fantabulous stations.

157
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Folks that are probably... I don't know this for sure.

158
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,053
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm speculating here.

159
00:18:21,073 --> 00:18:27,238
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm guessing there's at least one or two stations in there where that is what they do is like 365.

160
00:18:27,518 --> 00:18:31,281
[SPEAKER_04]: So to be nominated amongst that is like awesome.

161
00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:32,943
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know how to put it.

162
00:18:33,023 --> 00:18:34,524
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's our listeners who helped us get there.

163
00:18:34,564 --> 00:18:36,166
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, kisses to you guys.

164
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:36,786
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what?

165
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,327
[SPEAKER_21]: I have to make a mention to the chat room.

166
00:18:38,528 --> 00:18:38,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

167
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,562
[SPEAKER_21]: No, we are not going to have Roberto or Jaime.

168
00:18:42,802 --> 00:18:43,323
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

169
00:18:43,783 --> 00:18:44,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, no.

170
00:18:44,744 --> 00:18:46,486
[SPEAKER_21]: We are not going to be in Espanol.

171
00:18:46,846 --> 00:18:48,327
[SPEAKER_21]: We will be in Esperanto.

172
00:18:48,707 --> 00:18:56,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if we wanted to do the April Fool's thing, which we don't, having the station in Spanish one day would have been pretty funny.

173
00:18:57,415 --> 00:18:59,076
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got to write these down for next year.

174
00:19:00,237 --> 00:19:06,643
[SPEAKER_21]: Which is incredibly funny because I don't speak any Spanish except for El Telefono Es En Fuego.

175
00:19:08,991 --> 00:19:10,912
[SPEAKER_21]: Which translates to, the telephone is on fire.

176
00:19:12,173 --> 00:19:13,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Donde esta el baño?

177
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:15,555
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only one I know.

178
00:19:15,795 --> 00:19:16,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is the bathroom?

179
00:19:16,715 --> 00:19:19,196
[SPEAKER_21]: Because, you know, if you're going to go visit... We should do this show in Japanese.

180
00:19:19,457 --> 00:19:21,938
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to go visit, like, Tijuana, that's a phrase you need to know.

181
00:19:25,216 --> 00:19:25,736
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyway.

182
00:19:26,397 --> 00:19:27,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, back to the sound clip.

183
00:19:27,778 --> 00:19:28,539
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to play this.

184
00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:29,539
[SPEAKER_17]: Ah, screw the clip.

185
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:39,887
[SPEAKER_04]: You might remember we were actually nominated for Best of Life 365 last year in the category of Most Unlikely to Hear on AM FM Radio, which we got nominated in again this year, which is very cool.

186
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:42,069
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's two places to nominate us.

187
00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:45,071
[SPEAKER_04]: However, something very funny happened.

188
00:19:45,892 --> 00:19:53,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Three of us, all three of us, myself, DarkSakura, and Loki, we all went to the awards ceremony, and this is what happened when we got there.

189
00:19:54,932 --> 00:19:58,053
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, most unlikely to hear on AM FM radio.

190
00:19:58,073 --> 00:19:59,534
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that where we are?

191
00:19:59,594 --> 00:20:00,474
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

192
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:08,297
[SPEAKER_00]: Unnamed stream, fluffer tracks, Apollo 11, or Pern Pokemon Radio, P-I-R-N.

193
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:12,558
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.

194
00:20:13,118 --> 00:20:14,499
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Lounge was nominated as well.

195
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

196
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:18,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, crap.

197
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.

198
00:20:19,601 --> 00:20:20,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Those guys.

199
00:20:20,621 --> 00:20:21,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, damn.

200
00:20:22,082 --> 00:20:22,862
[SPEAKER_04]: What happened to that?

201
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:27,120
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, this is that Orange Lounge radio crap.

202
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:30,903
[SPEAKER_21]: Let me scrape off my shoes so we can get a nomination.

203
00:20:32,425 --> 00:20:32,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

204
00:20:33,806 --> 00:20:37,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I can just imagine us getting ready to leave the office.

205
00:20:37,128 --> 00:20:39,070
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm half drunk by the time they get to us.

206
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now, you guys remembered.

207
00:20:41,572 --> 00:20:44,334
[SPEAKER_04]: We got the fluffer station, the porn station.

208
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:45,895
[SPEAKER_04]: We got Pokemon, right?

209
00:20:46,435 --> 00:20:47,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's all we need.

210
00:20:48,317 --> 00:20:49,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Screw Orange Lounge.

211
00:20:49,137 --> 00:20:49,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Screw them.

212
00:20:50,077 --> 00:20:55,981
[SPEAKER_21]: I plan to sit at... I plan... Okay, this is my plan for the awards ceremony.

213
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:57,522
[SPEAKER_04]: This year?

214
00:20:57,982 --> 00:20:58,422
[SPEAKER_21]: This year.

215
00:20:58,442 --> 00:20:58,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh.

216
00:20:59,643 --> 00:21:02,045
[SPEAKER_21]: Is sitting at the damn table with a bottle of tequila.

217
00:21:02,965 --> 00:21:04,386
[SPEAKER_21]: Doing shots through the whole thing.

218
00:21:05,147 --> 00:21:05,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now.

219
00:21:06,147 --> 00:21:07,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen, though, very carefully.

220
00:21:07,368 --> 00:21:08,689
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to play a little clip of this again.

221
00:21:08,749 --> 00:21:10,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen very carefully.

222
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:15,273
[SPEAKER_04]: After they announce Pokemon Radio, which was the last one they read, they start to open the envelope.

223
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen very carefully to what happens in the background.

224
00:21:19,432 --> 00:21:20,933
[SPEAKER_00]: Radio, PIRN.

225
00:21:23,794 --> 00:21:25,916
[SPEAKER_04]: You distinctly hear Loki back there going, Hey!

226
00:21:27,076 --> 00:21:27,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey!

227
00:21:27,877 --> 00:21:28,837
[SPEAKER_21]: No!

228
00:21:28,897 --> 00:21:29,918
[SPEAKER_21]: This doesn't fly.

229
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:30,818
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, lady!

230
00:21:31,239 --> 00:21:33,560
[SPEAKER_10]: I wasted a tank of gas to get here!

231
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,382
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm drunk!

232
00:21:38,022 --> 00:21:39,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Say my name, bitch!

233
00:21:40,784 --> 00:21:41,644
[SPEAKER_18]: Say my name!

234
00:21:43,565 --> 00:21:46,727
[SPEAKER_18]: I think you and I were the only ones who drank.

235
00:21:46,787 --> 00:21:48,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, didn't you kick back a beer or two?

236
00:21:49,082 --> 00:21:49,282
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

237
00:21:49,602 --> 00:21:49,982
[SPEAKER_21]: You were driving.

238
00:21:50,002 --> 00:21:50,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because you had to drive.

239
00:21:50,883 --> 00:21:52,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody had to be responsible.

240
00:21:52,884 --> 00:21:55,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know why Loki was saying hey.

241
00:21:55,665 --> 00:21:56,225
[SPEAKER_04]: He wasn't driving.

242
00:21:56,285 --> 00:22:00,848
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it had like a Sapporo, a Heineken, and Guinness.

243
00:22:01,348 --> 00:22:04,029
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm like, let's have the international alcohol today.

244
00:22:07,051 --> 00:22:08,751
[SPEAKER_04]: So then, of course, just as a reminder.

245
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:10,832
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.

246
00:22:11,353 --> 00:22:12,733
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Lounge was nominated as well.

247
00:22:13,454 --> 00:22:14,854
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't make it to the envelope.

248
00:22:14,894 --> 00:22:15,475
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about that.

249
00:22:16,775 --> 00:22:19,742
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we reprinted them separately, so they might have.

250
00:22:19,822 --> 00:22:20,944
[SPEAKER_04]: I had no idea what that excuse was.

251
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:23,550
[SPEAKER_00]: And the winner goes to Fluffertracks, Vanevich.

252
00:22:24,371 --> 00:22:27,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay, hooray for the porno radio station.

253
00:22:29,178 --> 00:22:30,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray for them!

254
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:31,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, yeah, great.

255
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:35,463
[SPEAKER_04]: So just as a reminder, we didn't win last year, so we'd really appreciate your vote this year.

256
00:22:35,623 --> 00:22:42,269
[SPEAKER_04]: So head on over to www.orangehoundstrater.com, and it has a link so you can go to the ballot on 9th and 65th and vote!

257
00:22:42,669 --> 00:22:44,310
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope you all take a second to do that.

258
00:22:45,211 --> 00:22:47,813
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe this year we will be remembered on the envelope.

259
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:48,354
[SPEAKER_21]: This year?

260
00:22:49,615 --> 00:22:50,996
[SPEAKER_21]: We need to make a scene.

261
00:22:51,056 --> 00:22:57,460
[SPEAKER_21]: They need to realize that it is stations like us who make the money for them.

262
00:22:58,181 --> 00:22:58,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

263
00:22:58,981 --> 00:23:00,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Planet Earth's down here and you're up here again.

264
00:23:00,603 --> 00:23:01,303
[SPEAKER_21]: No, seriously.

265
00:23:02,684 --> 00:23:10,670
[SPEAKER_21]: If it wasn't for us and the fact that people keep wanting to listen to us and we have to pay them more money to enable our listeners to enjoy us.

266
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:18,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that maybe the fact that we somehow actually got nominated Broadcaster of the Year is a little bit of an apology for that last year?

267
00:23:18,346 --> 00:23:20,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, oh shit, we better make it up to them somehow.

268
00:23:21,788 --> 00:23:25,631
[SPEAKER_21]: They better have a table separated for us.

269
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:28,072
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but this is a weird thing.

270
00:23:28,292 --> 00:23:29,413
[SPEAKER_21]: With rose petals.

271
00:23:32,055 --> 00:23:35,177
[SPEAKER_21]: And, like, some nice champagne.

272
00:23:36,537 --> 00:23:37,178
[SPEAKER_21]: And waffles.

273
00:23:37,858 --> 00:23:38,719
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I like waffles.

274
00:23:40,026 --> 00:23:41,307
[SPEAKER_21]: I demand waffles!

275
00:23:41,607 --> 00:23:42,207
[SPEAKER_14]: Waffle!

276
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the crazy thing.

277
00:23:45,489 --> 00:23:49,871
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually have quite a few listeners in the Bay Area where this show's award ceremony is going to take place.

278
00:23:50,551 --> 00:23:53,112
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people have been asking me if they can go.

279
00:23:53,873 --> 00:24:04,578
[SPEAKER_05]: We have totally, have got to carry, totally have to make up the choreography for, um, yeah, choreography for, like, something sort of like, you know, the West Side Story, just come in, just start...

280
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Just, like, all just, like, come in and just, like, you know, prance around and shit.

281
00:24:10,102 --> 00:24:11,282
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be fucking hilarious.

282
00:24:12,003 --> 00:24:17,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, we will be taking official sign-ups on our website pretty soon for the official Orange Lounge Radio Entourage.

283
00:24:17,966 --> 00:24:31,932
[SPEAKER_04]: The folks that will be going with us to the awards show, they have to have 20 bucks, because it costs 20 bucks to go to the show, and you have to have your own way over there or something, because we don't have a big van or anything, so make sure you can find a ride to the hotel where this is going to be at, and I forget where it is.

284
00:24:32,213 --> 00:24:33,853
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll look it up later in the show and give it to you guys.

285
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:34,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

286
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:43,499
[SPEAKER_04]: But we do need people to actually be carrying the red carpet so that when Jamie, Loki, and myself arrive, they can roll it out so we can walk on it and walk in.

287
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,321
[SPEAKER_21]: That is awesome.

288
00:24:45,461 --> 00:24:47,002
[SPEAKER_21]: And it needs to be crushed velvet.

289
00:24:49,343 --> 00:24:50,064
[SPEAKER_21]: You think I'm kidding.

290
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:53,626
[SPEAKER_04]: The sad thing is, ladies and gentlemen, she's not.

291
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:54,406
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

292
00:24:54,446 --> 00:24:56,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so more to come on that a little later.

293
00:24:56,848 --> 00:24:59,069
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't want to keep dragging this segment out.

294
00:24:59,109 --> 00:24:59,490
[SPEAKER_21]: See, I'm...

295
00:25:01,428 --> 00:25:02,009
[SPEAKER_21]: No, forget it.

296
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,092
[SPEAKER_21]: I've said my piece.

297
00:25:03,112 --> 00:25:04,414
[SPEAKER_04]: You sure?

298
00:25:05,336 --> 00:25:05,797
[SPEAKER_21]: For now.

299
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:07,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

300
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,142
[SPEAKER_21]: But I'm going to return to this.

301
00:25:09,568 --> 00:25:11,869
[SPEAKER_21]: Live 365, now we know you're listening.

302
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:12,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we know.

303
00:25:13,009 --> 00:25:14,909
[SPEAKER_21]: You snubbed us last year.

304
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:18,550
[SPEAKER_21]: Now that we are really huge international celebrities.

305
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:19,731
[SPEAKER_04]: We are bigger this year.

306
00:25:20,331 --> 00:25:24,672
[SPEAKER_21]: We are bigger than... We have play on DDR Freak Radio.

307
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:28,113
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd say we're bigger than the Pope, but that would be in very poor taste this week.

308
00:25:28,153 --> 00:25:29,493
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're not bigger than that right now.

309
00:25:29,753 --> 00:25:36,174
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're bigger than... We are bigger than Goatsey.

310
00:25:36,555 --> 00:25:37,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're bigger than Goatsey.

311
00:25:38,135 --> 00:25:38,435
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

312
00:25:39,936 --> 00:25:41,037
[SPEAKER_21]: We are bigger than big.

313
00:25:41,617 --> 00:25:47,079
[SPEAKER_21]: And so you better get out the chapstick because you're going to be kissing our ass so much this year.

314
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.

315
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:57,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know how many fellow broadcasters are listening to this for the first time going, what a bunch of stuck up bitches.

316
00:25:57,263 --> 00:25:58,924
[SPEAKER_04]: See if they get our vote.

317
00:26:00,509 --> 00:26:02,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie really is a polite individual.

318
00:26:02,189 --> 00:26:06,630
[SPEAKER_04]: If you meet her in person, she's a big fluffy hug monster when you meet her.

319
00:26:07,931 --> 00:26:09,771
[SPEAKER_21]: I really am cute and adorable, aren't I?

320
00:26:11,132 --> 00:26:11,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't push it.

321
00:26:12,152 --> 00:26:16,213
[SPEAKER_21]: Seriously, I'm glad we got the nominations this year.

322
00:26:16,573 --> 00:26:17,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I'm very glad too.

323
00:26:17,693 --> 00:26:18,593
[SPEAKER_04]: I was surprised.

324
00:26:18,733 --> 00:26:20,674
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not bitter at all about last year.

325
00:26:21,694 --> 00:26:24,195
[SPEAKER_21]: It's an excuse for me to drink more expensive alcohol.

326
00:26:24,455 --> 00:26:30,076
[SPEAKER_21]: And have a good time encouraging our fellow broadcasters to

327
00:26:30,802 --> 00:26:33,244
[SPEAKER_21]: Continue to give the finger to conventional radio.

328
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:33,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

329
00:26:33,824 --> 00:26:36,226
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what this is really all about, is giving the finger to conventional radio.

330
00:26:36,246 --> 00:26:43,091
[SPEAKER_21]: We're about protecting our First Amendment rights and saying, Hey, regular radio, y'all can kiss my ass.

331
00:26:43,171 --> 00:26:44,332
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

332
00:26:44,452 --> 00:26:50,556
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to be able to say fucking shit on the air, and we're all about our right to say whatever we want.

333
00:26:50,636 --> 00:26:53,698
[SPEAKER_04]: If we want to tell dick and fart jokes for three hours, that's what we're going to do.

334
00:26:53,718 --> 00:26:55,059
[SPEAKER_21]: That's practically what we do anyway.

335
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:55,460
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

336
00:26:56,941 --> 00:26:57,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

337
00:26:57,281 --> 00:26:59,863
[SPEAKER_21]: And we've been doing this for two and a half years.

338
00:27:01,718 --> 00:27:02,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

339
00:27:03,078 --> 00:27:09,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start off tonight's show, but outside of that little rant, we usually start off the show with a little bit of, how was your week, how was your day?

340
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,000
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's back up a little bit.

341
00:27:11,801 --> 00:27:13,021
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, how was your week, how was your day?

342
00:27:13,241 --> 00:27:15,101
[SPEAKER_21]: Busy as all get out.

343
00:27:15,281 --> 00:27:16,042
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh my god.

344
00:27:16,722 --> 00:27:19,543
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, the week before was spring break.

345
00:27:20,643 --> 00:27:26,684
[SPEAKER_21]: So now that spring break's over, my ass is back in having to do all this crap for school.

346
00:27:27,004 --> 00:27:29,345
[SPEAKER_21]: And my teachers have actually taken a bit of mercy on us.

347
00:27:29,704 --> 00:27:31,746
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

348
00:27:54,093 --> 00:27:58,076
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

349
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:23,541
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to be coming up with a few more.

350
00:28:23,901 --> 00:28:27,203
[SPEAKER_21]: And Lemon Lime Jump, that's cool that your sister's a Marine, my little brother's a Marine too.

351
00:28:29,804 --> 00:28:37,128
[SPEAKER_21]: So, it's just really been pretty busy.

352
00:28:37,768 --> 00:28:42,451
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah, I did hang out yesterday with Iguana Girl and Tia.

353
00:28:43,511 --> 00:28:46,353
[SPEAKER_21]: We went shopping, we did girly stuff all day.

354
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:48,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

355
00:29:01,792 --> 00:29:07,516
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just, it's very frustrating right now because I'm in between sizes, so nothing I try on fits worth a damn.

356
00:29:07,576 --> 00:29:08,316
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question.

357
00:29:08,396 --> 00:29:12,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is it that pant sizes for, you know, for girls, they're always like, you know, 14, 16, 18.

358
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:16,482
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd say they're juniors.

359
00:29:18,583 --> 00:29:19,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I never knew that.

360
00:29:20,124 --> 00:29:21,205
[SPEAKER_21]: So that means I could go to Target.

361
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:22,206
[SPEAKER_21]: This is cool.

362
00:29:22,326 --> 00:29:25,008
[SPEAKER_21]: I can actually shop in the junior section at Target now.

363
00:29:26,388 --> 00:29:29,090
[SPEAKER_21]: That makes me very happy because I can get stuff cheap now.

364
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:31,552
[SPEAKER_21]: And I can go to thrift stores too.

365
00:29:34,551 --> 00:29:35,692
[SPEAKER_21]: Thrift store shopping is awesome.

366
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:36,712
[SPEAKER_21]: I went to a thrift store the other day.

367
00:29:36,993 --> 00:29:37,793
[SPEAKER_21]: They had a bunch of crap.

368
00:29:38,674 --> 00:29:40,075
[SPEAKER_21]: I almost bought some vinyl pants, though.

369
00:29:41,235 --> 00:29:41,796
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

370
00:29:41,836 --> 00:29:44,418
[SPEAKER_21]: But they were cut really funny.

371
00:29:45,298 --> 00:29:47,159
[SPEAKER_21]: And then I went today.

372
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:55,645
[SPEAKER_21]: Because of the stupid daylight savings time, my ass was up until 4 o'clock, which I was up until 5.30 on Friday, so it's all good.

373
00:29:57,806 --> 00:30:01,629
[SPEAKER_21]: And then I went out to lunch with Dan.

374
00:30:02,623 --> 00:30:04,545
[SPEAKER_21]: We found the motherlode of Atari games.

375
00:30:04,565 --> 00:30:05,325
[SPEAKER_21]: It was awesome.

376
00:30:29,671 --> 00:30:32,273
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, in fact, I've got a list here of what we found.

377
00:30:32,313 --> 00:30:47,225
[SPEAKER_21]: For anyone who is a classic gaming nut like me and my man are, um, we got, uh, the, uh, Star Trek, uh, Starfleet Academy thing that was on the Atari 2600 back in the day.

378
00:30:49,627 --> 00:30:50,107
[SPEAKER_21]: And, uh,

379
00:30:51,314 --> 00:30:56,398
[SPEAKER_21]: We also picked up Junior Pac-Man, Frogger 2, and Journey Escape.

380
00:31:05,859 --> 00:31:09,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I remember the Journey video game in the arcades like back in the 80s.

381
00:31:10,203 --> 00:31:16,148
[SPEAKER_04]: It was awesome because it actually had like MIDI style Don't Stop Believin' and open arms and stuff that played in the background.

382
00:31:16,568 --> 00:31:18,230
[SPEAKER_04]: But what is Journey Escape on the Atari?

383
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it the same thing?

384
00:31:19,371 --> 00:31:22,193
[SPEAKER_21]: We haven't even played it in, but it's one of the rarer Atari games.

385
00:31:22,233 --> 00:31:26,757
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to check it out because I want to know if it's just like the arcade game or if it's like a whole different adventure.

386
00:31:27,398 --> 00:31:33,003
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I also was digging around to replace some CDs that I've since lost and

387
00:31:33,544 --> 00:31:38,947
[SPEAKER_21]: I was off looking for, actually, specifically today I was looking for Blur CDs.

388
00:31:39,868 --> 00:31:49,473
[SPEAKER_21]: But as I was walking down to the register, this tape caught my eye from the side, and it turned out to be a Gorillaz promo DVD.

389
00:31:49,794 --> 00:31:50,894
[SPEAKER_21]: Not a DVD, but a VHS.

390
00:31:50,974 --> 00:31:53,656
[SPEAKER_04]: And Gorillaz is this band you've really been getting into lately, right?

391
00:31:54,717 --> 00:31:54,977
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

392
00:31:55,457 --> 00:31:58,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't give me that look.

393
00:31:58,979 --> 00:32:00,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me warm up my eyes a little bit.

394
00:32:01,514 --> 00:32:05,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, precious DarkSakura, what is the charm of the gorillas?

395
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,676
[SPEAKER_04]: No, seriously, what is it?

396
00:32:06,976 --> 00:32:13,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's like half art, half music, half fandom, which is three halves, but I don't know how it works.

397
00:32:13,338 --> 00:32:18,180
[SPEAKER_21]: Completely indescribable, just go to the website and you will be lost for hours digging through the studio.

398
00:32:19,821 --> 00:32:20,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

399
00:32:22,762 --> 00:32:26,203
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't have enough time in the show to go into it, so I won't.

400
00:32:28,244 --> 00:32:29,144
[SPEAKER_21]: Just read my live journal.

401
00:32:29,665 --> 00:32:30,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, fair enough.

402
00:32:31,431 --> 00:32:33,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of LiveJournal, we have an Orange Lounge LiveJournal community.

403
00:32:34,014 --> 00:32:38,099
[SPEAKER_04]: It's www.livejournal.com slash users slash Orange Lounge.

404
00:32:38,199 --> 00:32:38,640
[SPEAKER_04]: All one word.

405
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,681
[SPEAKER_21]: Nice plug.

406
00:32:39,882 --> 00:32:40,362
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.

407
00:32:40,622 --> 00:32:43,546
[SPEAKER_04]: And I haven't really plugged our chat room tonight either, so let me give that a shout out.

408
00:32:43,786 --> 00:32:45,448
[SPEAKER_04]: www.orangeloungeradio.com.

409
00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:47,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Click on chat.

410
00:32:48,112 --> 00:32:49,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, how was your week?

411
00:32:49,513 --> 00:32:49,854
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your day?

412
00:32:52,061 --> 00:32:53,462
[SPEAKER_05]: My week's been all over the place.

413
00:32:53,802 --> 00:32:55,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, let's see.

414
00:32:55,322 --> 00:32:58,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Starting with Monday.

415
00:32:58,243 --> 00:32:59,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Monday was kind of eh.

416
00:32:59,524 --> 00:33:00,524
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't really do anything.

417
00:33:00,704 --> 00:33:05,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Tuesday, they finally announced that I got the job at my company.

418
00:33:05,306 --> 00:33:08,947
[SPEAKER_05]: So now I'm actually game sales now with a nice bonus and nice pay raise.

419
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:09,948
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was cool.

420
00:33:10,668 --> 00:33:14,329
[SPEAKER_05]: And so now I'll be selling games and that kind of stuff.

421
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:15,250
[SPEAKER_05]: So that'll be cool.

422
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:19,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Then also, let's see what else happened.

423
00:33:19,857 --> 00:33:22,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Then Wednesday, nothing really much.

424
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:25,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, fast forward to about Friday.

425
00:33:25,441 --> 00:33:26,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Friday went and saw Sin City.

426
00:33:26,823 --> 00:33:27,583
[SPEAKER_05]: That was awesome.

427
00:33:29,745 --> 00:33:40,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Then yesterday, I went and got a PSP because I just had to have a PSP to mess around with.

428
00:33:40,274 --> 00:33:41,195
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was kind of cool.

429
00:33:41,215 --> 00:33:44,618
[SPEAKER_05]: I got Wipeout Pure and Twisted Metal head on.

430
00:33:45,226 --> 00:33:47,647
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I hit a car, and that sucked.

431
00:33:48,108 --> 00:33:49,889
[SPEAKER_05]: That was kind of the down point of the day.

432
00:33:49,929 --> 00:33:53,931
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't do any damage to the car, really, I mean, other than some paint scrapes.

433
00:33:53,991 --> 00:34:03,716
[SPEAKER_05]: I looked at my car, there's a little bit of a bent part on, next to the, uh, headlight, but I mean, it didn't even break the headlight or anything, and the bent part's just like, ever so slightly.

434
00:34:04,677 --> 00:34:06,998
[SPEAKER_05]: And, I mean, honestly, looking at it, you wouldn't even notice.

435
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:07,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and...

436
00:34:08,439 --> 00:34:12,567
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I had to call my insurance company and deal with all that crap, so that's just sucked.

437
00:34:12,607 --> 00:34:20,323
[SPEAKER_05]: But, honestly, I don't think anything's going to happen, because, I mean, they've been lowering my insurance, you know, for like the last... I don't even know how many years, and, you know...

438
00:34:21,713 --> 00:34:22,354
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

439
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:51,405
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was kind of fun though today with my PSP because I'm actually researching for the future for our website, PSP Access, special page, IRC, that kind of crap.

440
00:34:51,745 --> 00:35:01,069
[SPEAKER_05]: So I actually got on, well of course no one in our chat is going to be able to see it because it's in our mod forms, but I got on and actually made a post on Orange Lounge Radio with a PSP.

441
00:35:01,769 --> 00:35:02,630
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of amazing.

442
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:08,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Now for those who don't know, the way this has been done is there's actually on Wipeout Pure,

443
00:35:09,383 --> 00:35:14,128
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a downloadable content link on the actual main menu there.

444
00:35:15,109 --> 00:35:20,956
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going to happen later on, once they activate it, is you're going to be able to download new maps, new textures, etc.

445
00:35:22,517 --> 00:35:24,399
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's not available right now.

446
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,164
[SPEAKER_05]: The big community that buys PSPs, a lot of them are geeks.

447
00:35:28,524 --> 00:35:29,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

448
00:35:47,900 --> 00:36:09,691
[SPEAKER_05]: and so basically you can make a web page that has a bunch of links on it and like a browser input thing and you can actually connect to different websites that way and I mean this is being covered on Slashdot and Gadget a bunch of different websites so you can find out more about it on there but the new thing that they just started was PSP IRC and you actually can connect to IRC right now it's only one channel

449
00:36:10,372 --> 00:36:11,032
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

450
00:36:24,173 --> 00:36:42,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I've been hearing a lot of folks that are picking up a PSP, what they're actually doing with it is they're using the memory stick to actually put other things onto their PSP, such as pornography, but in more practical senses, their MP3 collections and things of this sort, so they can actually use their PSP as kind of like an iPod replacement, basically.

451
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:48,495
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people are now saying, F the iPod, because I can pick up a PSP and play MP3s on the go, correct?

452
00:36:49,471 --> 00:36:50,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Wipeout Wipeout Wipeout

453
00:37:08,331 --> 00:37:11,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I do, I have been playing Wipeout, and I actually kind of like it now.

454
00:37:11,752 --> 00:37:14,833
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I don't know, there's a few gripes I have.

455
00:37:14,913 --> 00:37:18,574
[SPEAKER_05]: First off, I don't have any dead pixels, so that's all good.

456
00:37:20,314 --> 00:37:22,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Second thing, my background's pink.

457
00:37:23,355 --> 00:37:28,377
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I realize that all the ones I've seen on the internet have been blue or green.

458
00:37:28,477 --> 00:37:29,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I read online today...

459
00:37:30,617 --> 00:37:31,778
[SPEAKER_05]: They change with the months.

460
00:37:31,898 --> 00:37:32,659
[SPEAKER_05]: They change colors.

461
00:37:33,019 --> 00:37:35,321
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that's why it's pink.

462
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:36,302
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't figure it out.

463
00:37:36,322 --> 00:37:38,303
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was special or something, but apparently not.

464
00:37:38,383 --> 00:37:43,147
[SPEAKER_21]: April is the month of the Cherry Tree Viewing Festival in Japan.

465
00:37:43,768 --> 00:37:47,150
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought they were just trying to say that, you know, that I got girly PSP.

466
00:37:47,971 --> 00:37:51,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, so, yeah, I got that in Twisted Metal Head-On.

467
00:37:52,074 --> 00:37:56,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Twisted Metal Head-On is exactly like Twisted Metal 2, just a little graphic upgrade.

468
00:37:57,858 --> 00:38:00,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I like the PSP, the only thing that bugs me is the analog stick.

469
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:02,459
[SPEAKER_05]: That thing is so uncomfortable.

470
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,440
[SPEAKER_05]: It just, it doesn't work for me.

471
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:08,961
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it would have been nice if they had it above the crosspad.

472
00:38:09,701 --> 00:38:11,682
[SPEAKER_05]: But, other than that, it's been pretty cool.

473
00:38:12,662 --> 00:38:15,303
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually hoping to get some more games for it later on.

474
00:38:18,464 --> 00:38:22,625
[SPEAKER_05]: I've also had fun finding open Wi-Fi networks by my house.

475
00:38:23,006 --> 00:38:27,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently there's some neighbors of ours that don't like to password protect their internet.

476
00:38:27,867 --> 00:38:32,789
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just jumped, the only problem is I can only jump on it outside because the signal's not that strong.

477
00:38:33,129 --> 00:38:37,011
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've been browsing the web out on our porch in the cold and rain.

478
00:38:38,263 --> 00:38:40,024
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's quite fun.

479
00:38:40,645 --> 00:38:47,289
[SPEAKER_05]: So all you folks out there, be sure to password check your internet or else you're going to have people jumping on with their PSPs.

480
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:53,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Now a question I was going to ask you before you were kind of talking about how folks are accessing the PSP networks and everything.

481
00:38:55,174 --> 00:39:02,318
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the probability, since folks are loading MP3s and videos and stuff, of us, and I know you're kind of looking into this, but I'm kind of curious how far away we are from seeing this,

482
00:39:02,622 --> 00:39:09,045
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how we do our podcast we do every week where we have the 25 to 30 minute extra show that we do via the podcast.

483
00:39:09,105 --> 00:39:10,526
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not rehashed material.

484
00:39:10,586 --> 00:39:11,666
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a whole separate thing.

485
00:39:11,686 --> 00:39:14,428
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to check that out, just go to orangehawnsradio.com, click on to go.

486
00:39:16,169 --> 00:39:20,171
[SPEAKER_04]: But what is the possibility of folks being able to download that directly onto their PSP?

487
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:22,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we know yet?

488
00:39:23,472 --> 00:39:26,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, I haven't been able... I haven't tried downloading anything.

489
00:39:27,034 --> 00:39:27,994
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think you can.

490
00:39:28,875 --> 00:39:28,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

491
00:39:30,251 --> 00:39:34,078
[SPEAKER_05]: I would imagine it's probably possible you might not be able to download it, maybe view it.

492
00:39:34,499 --> 00:39:36,082
[SPEAKER_05]: PSP browsing is kind of slow.

493
00:39:36,463 --> 00:39:37,926
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's actually pretty slow.

494
00:39:39,093 --> 00:39:39,933
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the only problem.

495
00:39:40,273 --> 00:39:51,157
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to get any good speed out of it, you need to disable the... There's a Wi-Fi power save mode on there, and you need to go under your power save options and actually disable that.

496
00:39:51,577 --> 00:39:52,998
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll browse the internet faster.

497
00:39:53,038 --> 00:39:57,759
[SPEAKER_05]: But, man, if you stream... If you try to download something, it's going to take forever.

498
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,981
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't think you can do it.

499
00:40:01,141 --> 00:40:04,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe streaming media like our website... Not our website, but our...

500
00:40:05,623 --> 00:40:12,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Our actual live station they might be able to pick up, but I don't think downloading a podcast would work.

501
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:19,444
[SPEAKER_04]: The live station might be kind of difficult too because you have to have that extra hurdle of accessing Live365 and all that.

502
00:40:19,504 --> 00:40:20,785
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

503
00:40:21,945 --> 00:40:25,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully they'll find something because that would be neat to have Orange Lounge on your PSP.

504
00:40:25,607 --> 00:40:25,928
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

505
00:40:26,428 --> 00:40:27,829
[SPEAKER_04]: If I had a PSP, I think it's pretty cool.

506
00:40:28,049 --> 00:40:33,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we can create a special edition of our podcast that's like a really, really low bitrate or something.

507
00:40:33,212 --> 00:40:33,852
[SPEAKER_04]: We can think of something.

508
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:37,974
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I haven't tried connecting to Live365.

509
00:40:38,014 --> 00:40:41,677
[SPEAKER_05]: That might be interesting to try out because it's all Java, I think.

510
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:42,077
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

511
00:40:42,937 --> 00:40:59,675
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing that really doesn't work on it is frames, and I know if you've visited our website, you've seen how on the side there, there's a little forum, the most recent topics that have been posted, and they kind of scroll up, while on the PSP they scroll left, so it's a little weird.

512
00:41:00,373 --> 00:41:09,898
[SPEAKER_04]: You know why I don't think Live 365 would work is because the player, when you actually launch the station, and I think most of you guys who are listening to the station probably have this, it actually pops up in a new window.

513
00:41:10,779 --> 00:41:12,480
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think PSP supports pop-ups.

514
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:18,463
[SPEAKER_04]: At least I hope it doesn't, or you could get pop-ups from almost any site out there and suddenly you'll have spyware all over your PSP.

515
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:22,445
[SPEAKER_04]: But because the player is in a pop-up, I don't know if it's going to be possible.

516
00:41:22,485 --> 00:41:25,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Now there is the direct access URL you can use, but...

517
00:41:25,587 --> 00:41:32,895
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you can only use it like, I don't remember, 365's official rules, but I think you can only use it three times and then they make you log in.

518
00:41:33,276 --> 00:41:36,759
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a long time since I've looked at the rules on that.

519
00:41:37,961 --> 00:41:39,603
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure there'll be a workaround for it.

520
00:41:40,363 --> 00:41:44,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Already, here's the other thing that they do have already that you can do that people are doing.

521
00:41:45,066 --> 00:41:45,927
[SPEAKER_05]: PSP Casting

522
00:42:07,723 --> 00:42:08,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

523
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:28,638
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually played some DDR today at home, several different mixes.

524
00:42:28,818 --> 00:42:35,401
[SPEAKER_04]: I was showing DDR to somebody who had not seen the Xbox mixes yet, so I got to play some Ultramix 2.

525
00:42:35,881 --> 00:42:39,402
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually worked out, I played some 9s, I was working up a sweat, it was something else.

526
00:42:39,702 --> 00:42:40,683
[SPEAKER_21]: That's good exercise.

527
00:42:41,424 --> 00:43:03,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, you might remember that earlier this week, I don't know if you listened to Thursday Night Show, but on Thursday Night's program we were talking about Yoshi's Touch and Go on the DS, which is a game that I picked up earlier this week because I don't want to spend $300 on a PSP, and I don't want to spend $150 on Night Style just yet, but I want to buy a game to hold me over until I have more money.

528
00:43:03,604 --> 00:43:07,706
[SPEAKER_04]: So I decided I'd go to GameStop and I was just randomly going to buy myself a new DS game.

529
00:43:07,726 --> 00:43:17,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Well the problem with the Nintendo DS right now, although the technology is excellent and the DS has a lot of potential, I would say about 1% of the DS potential is actually being used right now.

530
00:43:17,612 --> 00:43:20,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's what, like 12 games out there for the DS right now?

531
00:43:20,573 --> 00:43:21,634
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's really not a lot.

532
00:43:21,674 --> 00:43:24,956
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I said I wanted to buy a DS game, my choices were pretty limited.

533
00:43:25,516 --> 00:43:32,264
[SPEAKER_04]: So I finally ended up deciding to pick up this game, Yoshi's Touch and Go, which on Thursday Night Show I just slammed because I did not like the game at all.

534
00:43:32,304 --> 00:43:33,626
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was hard to get into.

535
00:43:33,646 --> 00:43:35,388
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was the same, repetitive.

536
00:43:35,929 --> 00:43:36,870
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is the weird thing.

537
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:39,793
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have not been able to put this game down.

538
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:45,180
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know if it's because it's the only DS game that I haven't worn out yet or what, but...

539
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,781
[SPEAKER_04]: I've still been playing this game, it's very, very odd.

540
00:43:49,301 --> 00:44:04,207
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like the fact that you can search for PictoChat rooms, like I've been just, like I was, my friend was driving to the club last night and I was actually playing Yoshi's Touch and Go in the car, searching for PictoChat rooms, trying to see if I could pick up, like, little kids doing PictoChat in the backseat of a car so I could hop on there and go, you know, you suck!

541
00:44:04,567 --> 00:44:05,267
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, or something, but...

542
00:44:06,809 --> 00:44:08,490
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't play it all this week.

543
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:09,150
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to help me level.

544
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:09,610
[SPEAKER_04]: I do party!

545
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:10,050
[SPEAKER_04]: I am a party girl!

546
00:44:29,585 --> 00:44:31,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody parties like I do, okay?

547
00:44:31,306 --> 00:44:31,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, sorry.

548
00:44:32,527 --> 00:44:33,728
[SPEAKER_04]: You gonna party like it's level 99?

549
00:44:33,788 --> 00:44:38,291
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the damn ferret?

550
00:44:40,253 --> 00:44:41,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I just got a ferret thrown at me.

551
00:44:43,335 --> 00:44:45,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, um, no, this is mine now.

552
00:44:45,377 --> 00:44:46,297
[SPEAKER_04]: This is mine, it's in my yard.

553
00:44:46,377 --> 00:44:47,558
[SPEAKER_21]: It's mine.

554
00:44:48,859 --> 00:44:50,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, anyway, I guess that's it for my week and my day.

555
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,321
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to drag this out.

556
00:44:51,361 --> 00:44:51,821
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Angel.

557
00:44:53,563 --> 00:44:57,245
[SPEAKER_19]: I found my chains of Prometheus, which means I'm back on the game.

558
00:44:57,866 --> 00:44:57,946
[SPEAKER_19]: Yay.

559
00:44:58,006 --> 00:44:58,086
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

560
00:44:59,969 --> 00:45:04,573
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, so that was like Thursday, I guess.

561
00:45:08,075 --> 00:45:19,423
[SPEAKER_19]: Tuesday, however, I went to school and went to my class, but only six people showed up, so obviously it got cancelled, and that sucks.

562
00:45:20,064 --> 00:45:23,686
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm going to wait until August and take it all over again, but it's all good.

563
00:45:24,587 --> 00:45:25,067
[SPEAKER_19]: I can wait.

564
00:45:25,467 --> 00:45:26,068
[SPEAKER_19]: I am patient.

565
00:45:28,823 --> 00:45:31,864
[SPEAKER_19]: Other than that, I played some DDR this week.

566
00:45:32,324 --> 00:45:32,604
[SPEAKER_19]: Yay.

567
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:39,626
[SPEAKER_19]: Met some people over at the place I usually play at that I hadn't seen in a while, so that was cool.

568
00:45:41,626 --> 00:45:44,087
[SPEAKER_19]: And not much yesterday.

569
00:45:44,307 --> 00:45:47,728
[SPEAKER_19]: Went out and met some people from...

570
00:45:50,098 --> 00:45:59,727
[SPEAKER_19]: Game Called There, I've talked about this many times over, but I actually got to meet the people behind their avatars, so it's cool.

571
00:46:01,249 --> 00:46:03,811
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I just had a really good weekend, and you know.

572
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:10,693
[SPEAKER_19]: and a really good week, so not too much to complain about, not too much to talk about, really.

573
00:46:11,434 --> 00:46:12,014
[SPEAKER_19]: Pretty boring.

574
00:46:12,334 --> 00:46:17,537
[SPEAKER_19]: But, hey, at least I can play Final Fantasy XI and a couple other games I've been playing.

575
00:46:17,957 --> 00:46:22,380
[SPEAKER_19]: Half-Life 2, Koff, Hack, and other stuff.

576
00:46:24,961 --> 00:46:25,561
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess that's it.

577
00:46:26,082 --> 00:46:28,343
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, I got Ultramix 2 this week.

578
00:46:31,184 --> 00:46:31,905
[SPEAKER_19]: We must play.

579
00:46:31,925 --> 00:46:33,806
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think of the DDR Ultramix 2?

580
00:46:35,549 --> 00:46:38,290
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know why, but my load time sucks.

581
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:42,612
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, I don't know if that's everyone's cartridge or just mine.

582
00:46:42,712 --> 00:46:44,733
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, not cartridge, but disc, rather.

583
00:46:45,273 --> 00:46:53,636
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if... You know what I've noticed is that booting up DDR Ultramix 2 takes forever, but once you finally get in there, it's not so bad.

584
00:46:53,756 --> 00:46:56,257
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's just the boot up takes a long time.

585
00:46:56,297 --> 00:46:57,638
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like trying to play something on the PSP.

586
00:47:00,188 --> 00:47:05,549
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I actually thought it was me because, you know, Andrew was like, why is it taking so long?

587
00:47:05,969 --> 00:47:06,789
[SPEAKER_19]: What's going on?

588
00:47:07,109 --> 00:47:08,590
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not supposed to be taking this long.

589
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:09,690
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm like, I don't know.

590
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:10,750
[SPEAKER_19]: Should we take it back?

591
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:11,490
[SPEAKER_19]: He goes, no, no, no.

592
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:13,071
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm like, okay.

593
00:47:13,291 --> 00:47:20,552
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, he's not giving me a straight answer, so I'm like, well, maybe I'll just ask Rob when I get here tomorrow, which I'm doing now, so that's cool.

594
00:47:21,212 --> 00:47:29,394
[SPEAKER_19]: But I think I do need to get a dual platform pad because the converter I'm using is kind of glitchy.

595
00:47:29,594 --> 00:47:29,814
[SPEAKER_19]: Yuck.

596
00:47:32,011 --> 00:47:32,552
[SPEAKER_19]: All righty.

597
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:47,581
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a request.

598
00:47:47,621 --> 00:47:48,141
[SPEAKER_04]: That's happy joy stuff.

599
00:48:05,654 --> 00:48:06,995
[SPEAKER_04]: What else are we going to have when we come back?

600
00:48:07,455 --> 00:48:08,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Skyblind, we'll open that up.

601
00:48:08,776 --> 00:48:13,019
[SPEAKER_04]: So go to www.orangelongeradio.com, click on interact with us if you have something you want to talk about.

602
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:17,863
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a request from the chat room to talk about a video game related tour going on this summer.

603
00:48:17,983 --> 00:48:19,785
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll talk about that because it's worth mentioning.

604
00:48:20,485 --> 00:48:22,647
[SPEAKER_04]: And other gaming news when we come back.

605
00:48:23,127 --> 00:48:26,670
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

606
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:29,853
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to start it off with a track from Beatmania 2DX11 style.

607
00:48:29,893 --> 00:48:31,454
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Injection of Love.

608
00:48:32,214 --> 00:48:32,895
[SPEAKER_13]: Injection of Love.

609
00:49:18,611 --> 00:49:20,114
Thank you for watching!

610
00:51:04,283 --> 00:51:04,603
Thank you.

611
00:51:58,517 --> 00:51:59,077
Thanks for watching!

612
00:52:37,902 --> 00:52:38,967
Thanks for watching!

613
00:53:17,109 --> 00:53:17,890
Thanks for watching!

614
00:53:46,997 --> 00:53:47,598
Thanks for watching!

615
00:55:18,086 --> 00:55:19,449
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

616
00:55:53,059 --> 00:55:53,944
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

617
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:38,399
[SPEAKER_30]: And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

618
00:56:39,148 --> 00:56:43,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.

619
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:44,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we talk about that?

620
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:46,852
[SPEAKER_09]: No subject will ever be taboo.

621
00:56:47,132 --> 00:56:50,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.

622
00:56:51,293 --> 00:56:53,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.

623
00:56:54,335 --> 00:56:59,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

624
00:57:00,237 --> 00:57:01,518
[SPEAKER_09]: I collect your fucking head.

625
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:04,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like this fucker here.

626
00:57:06,069 --> 00:57:09,751
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?

627
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:13,413
[SPEAKER_12]: The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

628
00:57:14,354 --> 00:57:20,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

629
00:57:22,038 --> 00:57:25,741
[SPEAKER_30]: Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

630
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:32,711
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, you guys are going to get a say in this next segment.

631
00:57:32,731 --> 00:57:34,632
[SPEAKER_03]: We are going to turn on the Skype line very soon.

632
00:57:35,012 --> 00:57:39,334
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want more information about what the Skype line is all about, www.orangeloungerator.com.

633
00:57:39,374 --> 00:57:40,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Click on Interact With Us.

634
00:57:41,655 --> 00:57:43,576
[SPEAKER_04]: In that break, you heard a variety of music there.

635
00:57:44,617 --> 00:57:49,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Wrapping it up from 11th Style, Don't Be Afraid Myself, before that Wall 5 with EVO 66.

636
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:56,562
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, because Jamie had to hear it, Gradius Full Speed by Mr. T in that break as well.

637
00:57:56,622 --> 00:57:57,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting it off, Injection of Love.

638
00:58:01,647 --> 00:58:04,949
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we have a little bit of competition going on tonight with Orange Launch Radio.

639
00:58:05,289 --> 00:58:10,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Folks are torn between whether they want to listen to Orange Launch Radio or watch WrestleMania.

640
00:58:10,891 --> 00:58:11,511
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what?

641
00:58:11,851 --> 00:58:13,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Or watch baseball.

642
00:58:13,131 --> 00:58:14,152
[SPEAKER_21]: Guilty, guilty, guilty.

643
00:58:15,412 --> 00:58:19,594
[SPEAKER_21]: Had I had a way to the Bay Area today, I'd be watching WrestleMania.

644
00:58:19,874 --> 00:58:20,414
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

645
00:58:20,434 --> 00:58:25,556
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't watch wrestling all year anymore, but WrestleMania is like, wow, it's WrestleMania.

646
00:58:26,916 --> 00:58:29,277
[SPEAKER_21]: Get to see my hot, sweaty men's and their drama.

647
00:58:30,914 --> 00:58:31,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Men's.

648
00:58:31,374 --> 00:58:31,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Men's.

649
00:58:31,934 --> 00:58:32,355
[SPEAKER_04]: You're men's.

650
00:58:32,395 --> 00:58:33,055
[SPEAKER_04]: What about the women?

651
00:58:33,075 --> 00:58:34,555
[SPEAKER_04]: There's women wrestlers too, right?

652
00:58:34,595 --> 00:58:35,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't they get into it?

653
00:58:35,075 --> 00:58:36,136
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, but they're all hoochies now.

654
00:58:36,156 --> 00:58:40,857
[SPEAKER_21]: They used to... WrestleMania 19 was the last one that had women that could actually wrestle.

655
00:58:41,058 --> 00:58:41,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh.

656
00:58:42,118 --> 00:58:43,658
[SPEAKER_21]: Just because of the one with Trish Shadis.

657
00:58:43,698 --> 00:58:44,819
[SPEAKER_04]: I just remember Chyna.

658
00:58:44,839 --> 00:58:46,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Because who doesn't remember Chyna?

659
00:58:46,379 --> 00:58:47,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially when it's the real life and everything.

660
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:52,161
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, and then she got into TNA and then got her booted from TNA and was all washed up.

661
00:58:52,241 --> 00:58:59,584
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, okay, she's really awesome and I think if she got her shit together she'd be all, you know, really cool, but...

662
00:59:00,979 --> 00:59:03,121
[SPEAKER_21]: Her time's passed unless she can grab it again.

663
00:59:03,141 --> 00:59:06,663
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just not the same.

664
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:07,864
[SPEAKER_21]: We need more Roid Girls.

665
00:59:08,225 --> 00:59:10,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of Surreal Life, have you heard about the new season of Surreal Life?

666
00:59:11,407 --> 00:59:13,969
[SPEAKER_04]: New season of Surreal Life is supposed to have... I mock reality TV.

667
00:59:14,469 --> 00:59:15,050
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, though?

668
00:59:15,070 --> 00:59:16,391
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know you love the Surreal Life.

669
00:59:16,631 --> 00:59:18,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, didn't you watch the previous one a little bit?

670
00:59:18,913 --> 00:59:19,153
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

671
00:59:19,633 --> 00:59:20,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you should.

672
00:59:21,074 --> 00:59:22,475
[SPEAKER_04]: It had Jaina in it and Mini-Me.

673
00:59:22,575 --> 00:59:25,397
[SPEAKER_21]: I watched the one where they were branding cattle.

674
00:59:25,638 --> 00:59:26,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, there you go.

675
00:59:26,278 --> 00:59:27,459
[SPEAKER_04]: So you watched at least one episode.

676
00:59:27,499 --> 00:59:28,640
[SPEAKER_04]: So you kind of know what the show's about.

677
00:59:29,326 --> 00:59:33,628
[SPEAKER_21]: and I did watch one episode before the first episode because I got to see Flava Flav.

678
00:59:33,908 --> 00:59:37,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so you watched like season three or two or three, I don't remember what it was.

679
00:59:37,029 --> 00:59:37,869
[SPEAKER_21]: I watched episodes.

680
00:59:38,089 --> 00:59:38,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

681
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:39,850
[SPEAKER_21]: I can count them on one hand.

682
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:45,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the new season is going to be good because they're going to have Omarosa who now... Oh, I know you're happy.

683
00:59:45,572 --> 00:59:46,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Wasn't she your hero?

684
00:59:47,233 --> 00:59:48,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I loved that woman.

685
00:59:48,233 --> 00:59:55,296
[SPEAKER_04]: She was on The Apprentice and I didn't love her because I actually thought she was cool but I loved to hate her.

686
00:59:55,436 --> 00:59:56,936
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't think... Anyway.

687
00:59:58,397 --> 00:59:58,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

688
01:00:00,083 --> 01:00:05,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Also what I love is Balki from Perfect Strangers is supposed to be on Surreal Life 5.

689
01:00:05,306 --> 01:00:06,506
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is just so cool to me.

690
01:00:06,767 --> 01:00:10,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what the heck has Balki done since Perfect Strangers?

691
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:13,530
[SPEAKER_05]: He's in a B-movie.

692
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:13,970
[SPEAKER_05]: I have it.

693
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:15,951
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be bringing it home soon, actually.

694
01:00:16,251 --> 01:00:19,573
[SPEAKER_21]: He needs to do Old Navy commercials now, just like the other washed-up actors.

695
01:00:20,334 --> 01:00:26,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, either you do Old Navy commercials or you join the Surreal Life cast.

696
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:30,313
[SPEAKER_05]: What happened to the other guy that was on Perfect Strangers?

697
01:00:30,353 --> 01:00:34,716
[SPEAKER_05]: They said bring back Perfect Strangers.

698
01:00:34,896 --> 01:00:35,656
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a bad idea.

699
01:00:35,676 --> 01:00:37,117
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they're not doing anything.

700
01:00:37,217 --> 01:00:38,818
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, no one knows them for anything.

701
01:00:38,918 --> 01:00:39,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Bring it back.

702
01:00:39,499 --> 01:00:41,300
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it can't be worse than Joey.

703
01:00:44,642 --> 01:00:46,083
[SPEAKER_21]: Julie, get your butt over here and say hi.

704
01:00:47,344 --> 01:00:49,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we have a special guest that just came in the studio.

705
01:00:49,086 --> 01:00:49,886
[SPEAKER_21]: Get your butt over.

706
01:00:49,926 --> 01:00:51,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Has Julie ever been on the show before?

707
01:00:51,968 --> 01:00:53,709
[SPEAKER_21]: She's as webcam shy as I am.

708
01:00:54,189 --> 01:00:55,690
[SPEAKER_21]: No, Julie hasn't been on the show before.

709
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:56,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hi, Julie.

710
01:00:56,551 --> 01:00:56,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello.

711
01:00:58,188 --> 01:00:58,928
[SPEAKER_26]: Hi, audience!

712
01:01:00,609 --> 01:01:10,976
[SPEAKER_21]: This is Julie, also known on DaWeb, the big internet monster as Kasumi19, who never updates her live journal, except once every six months.

713
01:01:12,737 --> 01:01:15,718
[SPEAKER_21]: They can't hear what you say if you don't talk into the microphone, as you know.

714
01:01:15,738 --> 01:01:18,760
[SPEAKER_26]: Actually, it's been about nine months.

715
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:19,561
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm horrible.

716
01:01:20,281 --> 01:01:20,781
[SPEAKER_26]: Here's Rob.

717
01:01:20,941 --> 01:01:21,822
[SPEAKER_17]: PSO addict.

718
01:01:22,861 --> 01:01:23,501
[SPEAKER_04]: I play some PSO sometimes.

719
01:01:23,521 --> 01:01:25,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Julie still needs to give me my Opa Opa.

720
01:01:47,859 --> 01:01:49,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's see, moving on.

721
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,501
[SPEAKER_04]: That was enough pop culture news.

722
01:01:51,561 --> 01:01:55,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about some actual Bomani news going on out there in the scene.

723
01:01:56,063 --> 01:02:04,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, surprisingly, not a whole heck of a lot, with the exception of some follow-up to the earlier announcement about 2DX Happy Sky.

724
01:02:04,768 --> 01:02:05,568
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you hear this?

725
01:02:05,588 --> 01:02:07,890
[SPEAKER_04]: 2DX 12th Style is going to be called Happy Sky.

726
01:02:08,290 --> 01:02:09,330
[SPEAKER_21]: Happy, happy, happy!

727
01:02:10,551 --> 01:02:11,271
[SPEAKER_21]: Brain twitch.

728
01:02:11,512 --> 01:02:12,092
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I know.

729
01:02:13,985 --> 01:02:15,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Some very interesting things.

730
01:02:16,347 --> 01:02:18,529
[SPEAKER_04]: They are just changing things upside down.

731
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:25,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Now all this is kind of coming off test location data, so it could be subject to change.

732
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:29,678
[SPEAKER_04]: High speed is going to be in there now, but it's going to be in halves as well.

733
01:02:29,938 --> 01:02:32,019
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can play one speed, two speed.

734
01:02:32,059 --> 01:02:34,301
[SPEAKER_04]: You could kind of do that before, but now you can have half, 1.5, 2.5.

735
01:02:34,622 --> 01:02:35,522
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's kind of cool.

736
01:02:39,205 --> 01:02:43,468
[SPEAKER_04]: They're supposed to be also hidden plus and sudden plus available in there.

737
01:02:44,228 --> 01:02:45,749
[SPEAKER_04]: S random mode as well.

738
01:02:45,769 --> 01:02:58,237
[SPEAKER_05]: With the sudden plus and hidden plus, they're also, they have adjustable hidden sudden areas to where you can pretty much decide where the notes appear or they disappear, etc.

739
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:01,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Now here's the other very interesting thing.

740
01:03:01,513 --> 01:03:08,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of Light, Normal, Another, now it's going to be Normal, Hyper, Another.

741
01:03:08,182 --> 01:03:14,730
[SPEAKER_04]: And this being probably, I think, some of the biggest news, the ratings are all changing because now Another's are going to be ranked.

742
01:03:15,151 --> 01:03:28,035
[SPEAKER_04]: So now instead of being like 1 through 8 with flashing 8s, which is the way it is now, for a lot of folks that are on home versions, you might only have seen 1 through 7 with flashing 7s, but in the arcades now it's 1 through 8 with flashing 8s.

743
01:03:28,355 --> 01:03:29,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's going to be 1 through 12.

744
01:03:31,056 --> 01:03:32,197
[SPEAKER_21]: About damn time.

745
01:03:32,357 --> 01:03:37,779
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the reported level 12 songs, V Another, which, you know, if you've ever seen V Another.

746
01:03:38,179 --> 01:03:41,660
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, and I would think that Sakura would be up there.

747
01:03:42,284 --> 01:03:42,704
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

748
01:03:42,965 --> 01:03:45,590
[SPEAKER_04]: They're saying right now that that is the only level 12 one.

749
01:03:47,648 --> 01:03:54,513
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that as far as the DJ Lee Su videos, that was the only one he had to do with using two hands.

750
01:03:56,894 --> 01:03:57,795
[SPEAKER_04]: It's some scary stuff.

751
01:03:59,916 --> 01:04:04,299
[SPEAKER_04]: And then some pictures are available if you visit our website, www.orangelandredo.com.

752
01:04:04,339 --> 01:04:13,845
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, some of the news, I think we might have touched on this a little bit last week, I don't remember, but there is a crossover artist showing up from DDR Ultramix 2.

753
01:04:15,386 --> 01:04:17,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Big Idea, who did the song Toe Jam.

754
01:04:18,168 --> 01:04:25,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Toe Jam is going to be in Happy Sky, which is really weird that a USA artist is crossing over into 2DX.

755
01:04:25,811 --> 01:04:26,572
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of neat, though.

756
01:04:27,392 --> 01:04:31,114
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, there's good talent all over the world.

757
01:04:31,134 --> 01:04:43,380
[SPEAKER_04]: There is, there is, but when I think of all the possible DDR songs in history that were created for DDR that should cross over into Beatmania 2DX, Toe Jam isn't really the first one that comes to my mind.

758
01:04:44,269 --> 01:04:48,250
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a bad start, just, you know, it could be better.

759
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:51,671
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, they've gotten European artists.

760
01:04:51,691 --> 01:04:53,891
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's true.

761
01:04:56,352 --> 01:05:02,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Some other artists coming back as well, Twin Amadeus, Platonic X, a lot of folks you know.

762
01:05:02,773 --> 01:05:04,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Ryu, of course, going to be back.

763
01:05:04,154 --> 01:05:06,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Ryu kind of just started all of a sudden showing up all the time.

764
01:05:06,494 --> 01:05:07,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Terra, all those folks.

765
01:05:09,035 --> 01:05:10,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Check that out, that will be...

766
01:05:11,252 --> 01:05:15,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Location testing currently and hopefully coming to an arcade near you pretty soon.

767
01:05:19,491 --> 01:05:22,093
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's pretty much the biggest Bomani news going on right now.

768
01:05:22,133 --> 01:05:23,954
[SPEAKER_04]: I can think of some local Bomani news going on.

769
01:05:24,014 --> 01:05:26,336
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to touch on this, and then we'll open up the skyline.

770
01:05:26,356 --> 01:05:28,878
[SPEAKER_21]: In Sacramento, two things, jack and shit.

771
01:05:29,279 --> 01:05:31,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually, no, there's a pretty big story going on right now.

772
01:05:32,041 --> 01:05:35,683
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's at an arcade we don't really go to a whole lot, Roseville Golf Land.

773
01:05:36,544 --> 01:05:41,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, understandably, we are an international radio program, so we have folks that listen all over.

774
01:05:41,348 --> 01:05:43,770
[SPEAKER_04]: But sometimes we talk about our neck of the woods, which is Sacramento.

775
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:45,231
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have this arcade here.

776
01:05:45,251 --> 01:05:46,852
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a beautiful arcade.

777
01:05:46,892 --> 01:05:48,273
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a two-story arcade.

778
01:05:48,733 --> 01:05:51,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Huge arcade with a fancy water park.

779
01:05:51,836 --> 01:05:52,296
[SPEAKER_04]: It's ghetto.

780
01:05:52,457 --> 01:05:53,137
[SPEAKER_04]: It's ghetto as hell.

781
01:05:53,417 --> 01:06:00,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Because parents drop their children off there and just leave them there to wreak havoc on the whole place and so they break machines and everything.

782
01:06:00,844 --> 01:06:01,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's the great news.

783
01:06:02,085 --> 01:06:08,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Roseville Golf Land got Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania V. The brand new ones.

784
01:06:09,591 --> 01:06:10,592
[SPEAKER_21]: I have a reason to go again.

785
01:06:10,792 --> 01:06:12,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Already the hi-hat is broken.

786
01:06:13,414 --> 01:06:16,197
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, why does that crap not surprise me whatsoever?

787
01:06:18,291 --> 01:06:21,358
[SPEAKER_05]: and the green button on the left guitar is broken as well.

788
01:06:21,979 --> 01:06:26,067
[SPEAKER_21]: At least some woman didn't try to change her baby's diaper on it like on Little Keyboard Mania.

789
01:06:27,109 --> 01:06:29,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably would have if there was a platform to do so.

790
01:06:33,197 --> 01:06:34,638
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, that's great.

791
01:06:34,658 --> 01:06:41,844
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all excited because we're getting the new Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania V. And it's very interesting because I was talking to one of our listeners before the show who lives in Vegas.

792
01:06:42,244 --> 01:06:51,111
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're all excited because they just got 2DX Red and Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania V. And I'm like, yeah, we got it too, except, you know, 2DX Red doesn't work.

793
01:06:51,171 --> 01:06:52,932
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a frame without a monitor right now.

794
01:06:53,172 --> 01:06:55,634
[SPEAKER_04]: And Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania V, both broken.

795
01:06:58,236 --> 01:06:58,756
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what?

796
01:06:59,597 --> 01:07:00,898
[SPEAKER_21]: They should let me run Golf Land.

797
01:07:03,001 --> 01:07:08,435
[SPEAKER_21]: First of all, there would be absolutely none of those retards that piss me off allowed.

798
01:07:09,577 --> 01:07:12,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Would there actually be a sign on the door that says no retards that piss me off?

799
01:07:12,907 --> 01:07:13,407
[SPEAKER_21]: Exactly.

800
01:07:14,167 --> 01:07:21,749
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'll have a list of the people that I've actually had kicked out so that they would know specifically that they are not allowed in.

801
01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:25,610
[SPEAKER_21]: And then I would have to have some type of scanning device, I think.

802
01:07:25,871 --> 01:07:29,592
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe we would be like the, you remember the Studio 54?

803
01:07:29,652 --> 01:07:30,132
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I do.

804
01:07:30,152 --> 01:07:34,593
[SPEAKER_21]: We would be the Studio 54 of the 21st century.

805
01:07:36,113 --> 01:07:36,713
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that idea.

806
01:07:37,054 --> 01:07:38,654
[SPEAKER_21]: Except with no cocaine bar in the back room.

807
01:07:40,865 --> 01:07:41,606
[SPEAKER_04]: How about a heroin bar?

808
01:07:41,646 --> 01:07:42,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we have that instead?

809
01:07:42,907 --> 01:07:45,089
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, we can have heroin, but we have to move to the Netherlands.

810
01:07:45,530 --> 01:07:47,432
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

811
01:07:47,792 --> 01:07:53,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so I just want to kind of catch you up on that, that we're all excited to have Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania V in town.

812
01:07:54,178 --> 01:07:58,823
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would give you my full review, however, that shit's broken, so I can't.

813
01:07:58,923 --> 01:07:59,564
[SPEAKER_04]: So sorry, guys.

814
01:08:01,085 --> 01:08:03,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we'll go take some pictures of the broken stuff.

815
01:08:03,127 --> 01:08:03,468
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

816
01:08:04,128 --> 01:08:05,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we are going to open up the Skype line.

817
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:15,136
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys want to call in and interact with our program, you have something you want to comment on, such as possibly the new 2DX Happy Sky, something that's going on in your neck of the woods.

818
01:08:15,197 --> 01:08:17,818
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there were a couple DDR tournaments that went on pretty recently.

819
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:20,180
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll open up the Skype line.

820
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,142
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, we're already getting a call, so let's go to it.

821
01:08:22,202 --> 01:08:23,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

822
01:08:24,181 --> 01:08:30,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Emerging from the shadows of Bimani style, here's your resident 2DX bastard, DarkLionXVI.

823
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:30,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey Sky, sit here.

824
01:08:31,492 --> 01:08:39,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, you've got quite a... I should get a fanfare to play when he introduces... Alright, what's on your mind, buddy?

825
01:08:39,721 --> 01:08:45,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, I already told you that Vegas has officially gone V and Red.

826
01:08:45,343 --> 01:08:49,265
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Guitadora V and 2DX Red as of last Thursday.

827
01:08:49,305 --> 01:08:53,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so you were the person I was mentioning a little bit earlier that was telling me about what's going on in Vegas.

828
01:08:54,187 --> 01:08:58,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, did you hear what I was just saying about Roseville Golf Lands got all that too, except none of it works?

829
01:08:58,448 --> 01:08:58,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, okay.

830
01:08:59,429 --> 01:09:00,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're lucky here.

831
01:09:01,229 --> 01:09:05,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and about 2DX 12, Happy Sky, I have to mention to you the...

832
01:09:06,272 --> 01:09:15,778
[SPEAKER_06]: songs that are 12 stars on single oh dude is there more than just be another I only had heard of be another what else is there uh there's a ace double ace

833
01:09:16,782 --> 01:09:30,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Colors Radio Edit, Time, Genocide, Gigadelic, Innocent Walls, Moonchild, One More Lovely, Please Don't Go, and Piano Kyousokyoku Dai Ichiban Sasoribi, a.k.a.

834
01:09:30,312 --> 01:09:31,033
[SPEAKER_06]: P.F.

835
01:09:31,093 --> 01:09:35,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Concerto Artiaris, Sakura, and Setsugekka,

836
01:09:42,816 --> 01:09:44,196
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are quite a few Anothers.

837
01:09:44,257 --> 01:09:45,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's good.

838
01:09:45,717 --> 01:09:48,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Good difficulty there for the folks that can actually do that stuff.

839
01:09:48,898 --> 01:09:49,718
[SPEAKER_04]: More power to ya.

840
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:54,160
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm lucky if I can pass an 8, especially considering I haven't played in quite some time.

841
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:58,481
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm really excited about the Anothers actually having rankings now.

842
01:09:58,921 --> 01:10:03,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, I follow 2DX, but I'm not, like, super obsessed.

843
01:10:03,363 --> 01:10:04,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't study note charts.

844
01:10:04,583 --> 01:10:06,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I have friends that do this, and that's cool.

845
01:10:06,684 --> 01:10:07,664
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, you know, that's cool.

846
01:10:07,684 --> 01:10:08,305
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they're into.

847
01:10:08,745 --> 01:10:08,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

848
01:10:09,765 --> 01:10:15,810
[SPEAKER_04]: But, like, if I'm going to play in Another, I want to instantly be able to know which Another is in my range.

849
01:10:15,850 --> 01:10:21,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you know how, like, Holic was like a 6, but the Another for Holic is freaking insane?

850
01:10:21,796 --> 01:10:24,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, so I want to know about where the Another's stand.

851
01:10:24,558 --> 01:10:28,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas, like, Dual Control Another, from what I remember, was not that much harder than the original.

852
01:10:29,062 --> 01:10:31,884
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's just, you know, I want to know where they stand on the scale.

853
01:10:31,925 --> 01:10:33,666
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's going to be very helpful to somebody like me.

854
01:10:33,746 --> 01:10:34,627
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm excited about that.

855
01:10:36,617 --> 01:10:40,480
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the singles for 11 stars, it's already listed here on this website.

856
01:10:42,062 --> 01:10:45,764
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to mention it, the reds are going to be in another.

857
01:10:46,265 --> 01:10:52,370
[SPEAKER_06]: First, Samurai, Andromeda, Blox, checking you out, click again, Daddy Daddy,

858
01:10:52,950 --> 01:11:22,043
[SPEAKER_06]: FakeTimeHyper, G2, GigadelicHyper, Judeka, GreenEyes, HalfwayOfPromise, Holic, InnocentWallsHyper, Kechak, Key, LowerWorld, Lucy, LoveToMeUchisEdition, Murmurtwins, Nemesis, Number13, WarnoR8, Quasar, R5, RainbowFlyer, RainbowRainbow, SecretOfLove, SpaceFight, Spyka, SpiralGalaxy, Stoic, TakeItEasy, WonderBullFighter, and Xenon.

859
01:11:22,483 --> 01:11:23,684
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are all the 11s?

860
01:11:24,364 --> 01:11:25,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the 11s are.

861
01:11:26,005 --> 01:11:26,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting, wow.

862
01:11:27,486 --> 01:11:29,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Stoic Another's not a 12, it's an 11?

863
01:11:29,727 --> 01:11:31,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess I could see that, though.

864
01:11:32,489 --> 01:11:34,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Compared to, like, Moonchild Another, I guess I could see that.

865
01:11:35,971 --> 01:11:36,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

866
01:11:36,992 --> 01:11:40,253
[SPEAKER_04]: So what else is going on besides that 2DX update?

867
01:11:40,754 --> 01:11:48,178
[SPEAKER_06]: I just sent you a private message about the videos for the location test on the 2DX 12 Happy Sky.

868
01:11:48,418 --> 01:11:51,180
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm gonna post it on the chat room.

869
01:11:51,434 --> 01:11:54,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, post us a link there in the chatroom at orangezonesradio.com, click on chat.

870
01:11:55,016 --> 01:11:58,498
[SPEAKER_06]: And for those who are listening, it's at xenon.sub.jp.

871
01:11:59,158 --> 01:11:59,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, cool.

872
01:12:00,019 --> 01:12:04,901
[SPEAKER_04]: So post that link in our chatroom and then folks can check out the Happy Sky test location videos.

873
01:12:05,182 --> 01:12:07,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you actually hear any of the music at all in some of this?

874
01:12:07,683 --> 01:12:08,403
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very clear.

875
01:12:08,683 --> 01:12:09,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, good.

876
01:12:09,624 --> 01:12:14,987
[SPEAKER_06]: The first video that I checked out is 100% Minimoog by Sota Fujimori.

877
01:12:15,267 --> 01:12:16,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay, cool.

878
01:12:16,067 --> 01:12:16,848
[SPEAKER_04]: How's the song sound?

879
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:18,564
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really fast.

880
01:12:18,705 --> 01:12:21,708
[SPEAKER_06]: It's at 252 BPM.

881
01:12:22,690 --> 01:12:24,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'll have to check that out a little later.

882
01:12:24,632 --> 01:12:27,455
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's clear enough, maybe we'll play some on the show a little later.

883
01:12:27,496 --> 01:12:28,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Really clear.

884
01:12:28,937 --> 01:12:29,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

885
01:12:30,219 --> 01:12:30,639
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

886
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:32,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you want to share with us tonight, Siggy?

887
01:12:33,123 --> 01:12:36,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, last thing I want to say is quit calling it bad styles.

888
01:12:36,964 --> 01:12:38,964
[SPEAKER_06]: You always keep on calling it 11th style.

889
01:12:39,265 --> 01:12:43,065
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, but it's just... I don't know how to explain it.

890
01:12:43,105 --> 01:12:45,846
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just... It's the style thing.

891
01:12:46,346 --> 01:12:53,248
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, yeah, it's like, you know, 10th style and then it just seems logical the next 2DX because they haven't changed the hardware or anything.

892
01:12:53,268 --> 01:12:59,810
[SPEAKER_04]: They've only changed... They really haven't changed much than what they changed going from 5th to 6th and 6th to 7th and so on.

893
01:13:00,230 --> 01:13:01,490
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I just...

894
01:13:02,150 --> 01:13:03,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Naturally call it Eleven.

895
01:13:03,171 --> 01:13:04,492
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's Red and Happy Sky.

896
01:13:04,772 --> 01:13:08,974
[SPEAKER_04]: But seriously, do you expect me to call this new 2DX Happy Sky and keep a straight face?

897
01:13:09,955 --> 01:13:13,397
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you... Everybody can tell you're gonna call it Twelfth Style.

898
01:13:14,097 --> 01:13:16,979
[SPEAKER_06]: And speaking of Twelfth Style, there is such a song called Twelfth Style.

899
01:13:17,759 --> 01:13:18,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

900
01:13:21,521 --> 01:13:24,223
[SPEAKER_04]: In Happy Sky, there's gonna be a song called Twelfth Style?

901
01:13:24,663 --> 01:13:24,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

902
01:13:25,383 --> 01:13:25,963
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.

903
01:13:27,224 --> 01:13:29,365
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe it's okay, then, that I call it Twelfth Style.

904
01:13:29,866 --> 01:13:29,966
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

905
01:13:29,986 --> 01:13:30,186
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

906
01:13:30,709 --> 01:13:34,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well thank you for the pronunciation update, I appreciate it.

907
01:13:35,512 --> 01:13:38,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not so much pronunciation, but you know, like referring to, anyway.

908
01:13:39,254 --> 01:13:42,056
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta mention the videos on the Sinon subs that they have.

909
01:13:42,836 --> 01:13:47,339
[SPEAKER_06]: The first one is Captivate Joker, which means Purify.

910
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:51,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Second video they have is Get Cool, which is Moonlight.

911
01:13:52,242 --> 01:13:53,703
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the third one is Green Eyes.

912
01:13:54,363 --> 01:13:57,585
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the last one is the video that I mentioned is 100% Minimoog.

913
01:13:57,605 --> 01:13:57,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

914
01:14:01,324 --> 01:14:03,185
[SPEAKER_04]: I might have to check that out because I want to hear some of those songs.

915
01:14:03,225 --> 01:14:05,406
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to hear what they sound like, so I'll definitely be looking at that.

916
01:14:05,946 --> 01:14:06,146
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

917
01:14:06,446 --> 01:14:06,726
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

918
01:14:07,347 --> 01:14:07,587
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

919
01:14:07,747 --> 01:14:08,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thanks for the call, bud.

920
01:14:08,827 --> 01:14:09,328
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a good one.

921
01:14:10,028 --> 01:14:10,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

922
01:14:10,348 --> 01:14:10,768
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, later.

923
01:14:12,529 --> 01:14:14,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Resident 2DX Bastard Siggy.

924
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:15,490
[SPEAKER_04]: We always like hearing from him.

925
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:17,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to another call.

926
01:14:17,932 --> 01:14:19,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

927
01:14:19,952 --> 01:14:21,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Greetings, it's Ranma South.

928
01:14:21,253 --> 01:14:22,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me one more time, how are you guys doing?

929
01:14:22,953 --> 01:14:23,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, how are you doing?

930
01:14:24,553 --> 01:14:25,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Somewhat tired.

931
01:14:25,573 --> 01:14:27,874
[SPEAKER_02]: I want you to know that I am a devoted fan of the show.

932
01:14:28,374 --> 01:14:34,235
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to Boston this weekend, and I arranged my trip so I can come back in time to catch the show.

933
01:14:34,375 --> 01:14:35,235
[SPEAKER_04]: That's hardcore.

934
01:14:35,675 --> 01:14:35,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it is.

935
01:14:35,995 --> 01:14:37,056
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very hardcore.

936
01:14:37,576 --> 01:14:39,076
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't have to do that for us.

937
01:14:39,156 --> 01:14:44,237
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, heck, if I was going to Boston, I wouldn't have rearranged my trip to come back for this show.

938
01:14:44,557 --> 01:14:45,838
[SPEAKER_21]: But we adore you for it.

939
01:14:45,858 --> 01:14:47,138
[SPEAKER_21]: You are awesome and fabulous.

940
01:14:47,158 --> 01:14:48,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you are awesome and fabulous.

941
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:49,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I do try.

942
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:51,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, right on.

943
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:52,241
[SPEAKER_04]: What else is on your mind?

944
01:14:52,601 --> 01:14:54,281
[SPEAKER_04]: What's been going on in your gaming world this week?

945
01:14:55,102 --> 01:14:55,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Not much.

946
01:14:56,062 --> 01:14:58,984
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing some of my old PS2 games recently.

947
01:14:59,664 --> 01:15:01,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now I'm trying to work through Musashi.

948
01:15:01,125 --> 01:15:01,845
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in love with it.

949
01:15:03,410 --> 01:15:05,071
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

950
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:35,343
[SPEAKER_21]: I watched it a bit when it came on TV, but I was so not into Johnny Depp at the time.

951
01:15:35,403 --> 01:15:36,404
[SPEAKER_21]: It was all River Phoenix.

952
01:15:37,524 --> 01:15:38,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, alright.

953
01:15:38,865 --> 01:15:41,327
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe now you'd have more respect for it?

954
01:15:41,347 --> 01:15:41,767
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

955
01:15:43,008 --> 01:15:43,408
[SPEAKER_21]: Not really.

956
01:15:43,568 --> 01:15:44,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, sorry.

957
01:15:45,209 --> 01:15:46,350
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, by the way, guess what?

958
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:47,150
[SPEAKER_21]: Ranma?

959
01:15:47,751 --> 01:15:48,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what's up?

960
01:15:48,591 --> 01:15:52,393
[SPEAKER_21]: I found a doco CD at the used record store today.

961
01:15:53,014 --> 01:15:53,834
[SPEAKER_02]: First or second?

962
01:15:55,035 --> 01:15:56,336
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, it was one of the later ones.

963
01:15:57,179 --> 01:16:01,802
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, my fiancé, when I moved in with him, had something like 22 Ranma CDs.

964
01:16:02,262 --> 01:16:02,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

965
01:16:02,763 --> 01:16:04,524
[SPEAKER_21]: I also found the Fighting Karuta there, too.

966
01:16:04,544 --> 01:16:07,886
[SPEAKER_02]: I had that, and I lost it.

967
01:16:08,046 --> 01:16:08,767
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, you know what?

968
01:16:09,507 --> 01:16:11,909
[SPEAKER_21]: Why don't I set a little time aside in the week?

969
01:16:11,949 --> 01:16:13,910
[SPEAKER_21]: If it's still there, I will grab you the Fighting Karuta.

970
01:16:14,631 --> 01:16:15,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.

971
01:16:15,131 --> 01:16:15,491
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.

972
01:16:15,531 --> 01:16:17,272
[SPEAKER_21]: Because it has the Okonomiyaki song on it.

973
01:16:18,053 --> 01:16:18,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

974
01:16:19,894 --> 01:16:20,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

975
01:16:20,114 --> 01:16:20,875
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really awesome.

976
01:16:20,975 --> 01:16:22,096
[SPEAKER_21]: Okonomiyaki.

977
01:16:22,796 --> 01:16:23,517
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't do it anymore.

978
01:16:25,098 --> 01:16:25,798
[SPEAKER_21]: Okonomiyaki.

979
01:16:28,345 --> 01:16:31,007
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to cosplay Ucchan one of these days, you got to.

980
01:16:31,347 --> 01:16:35,369
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I've been working and working on that, and I keep saying that I'll do it, and I never do.

981
01:16:36,470 --> 01:16:38,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Half the fun is walking around with a giant spatula.

982
01:16:40,632 --> 01:16:41,773
[SPEAKER_21]: I cosplayed Baiken once.

983
01:16:42,553 --> 01:16:43,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.

984
01:16:43,253 --> 01:16:44,774
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think I've seen pictures of that.

985
01:16:45,455 --> 01:16:50,578
[SPEAKER_21]: There's one on FansView back in the day, and then there was one of me as Mad Hatter for Angel Sanctuary.

986
01:16:50,598 --> 01:16:52,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm going to have to go digging through that.

987
01:16:52,859 --> 01:16:54,740
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to ask Kevin if he can send it to me.

988
01:16:55,089 --> 01:16:56,450
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll see if I have it somewhere.

989
01:16:57,090 --> 01:16:57,611
[SPEAKER_21]: It's horrible.

990
01:16:58,011 --> 01:16:59,772
[SPEAKER_21]: It was like 60 pounds heavier in it.

991
01:17:02,094 --> 01:17:03,415
[SPEAKER_02]: But you probably still look hot anyway.

992
01:17:04,275 --> 01:17:05,136
[SPEAKER_21]: That is so sweet.

993
01:17:05,156 --> 01:17:05,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my, oh my.

994
01:17:06,777 --> 01:17:07,798
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, fluster.

995
01:17:08,158 --> 01:17:09,359
[SPEAKER_21]: Ego fluster.

996
01:17:09,399 --> 01:17:11,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, she's already living on another planet tonight.

997
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:12,841
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't need to, you know.

998
01:17:12,861 --> 01:17:14,402
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, I am a celebrity.

999
01:17:14,962 --> 01:17:16,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly, exactly.

1000
01:17:16,383 --> 01:17:17,504
[SPEAKER_21]: You just watch it.

1001
01:17:18,945 --> 01:17:21,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for that, I'll eat a bag of M&M's just for you.

1002
01:17:22,748 --> 01:17:22,848
[SPEAKER_19]: Aww.

1003
01:17:24,207 --> 01:17:27,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, any other ass you want to kiss while you're on the line here, Ranma?

1004
01:17:28,733 --> 01:17:31,917
[SPEAKER_04]: I love you, Sky, because you're still a devoted fan of the DS.

1005
01:17:33,058 --> 01:17:33,419
[SPEAKER_04]: I am.

1006
01:17:33,779 --> 01:17:35,021
[SPEAKER_04]: I have faith in the DS.

1007
01:17:35,361 --> 01:17:36,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I appreciate that.

1008
01:17:36,542 --> 01:17:37,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Rob.

1009
01:17:39,051 --> 01:17:40,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that DS.

1010
01:17:41,814 --> 01:17:44,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time somebody says DS, DarkSakura goes, hee hee, that's me.

1011
01:17:44,477 --> 01:17:45,758
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, why wouldn't they think about me?

1012
01:17:45,859 --> 01:17:46,139
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1013
01:17:46,599 --> 01:17:50,744
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, it's hard for me to be a fan of the DS right now because we're in a little bit of a slump.

1014
01:17:51,304 --> 01:17:53,006
[SPEAKER_04]: But I am still a fan of the DS.

1015
01:17:53,267 --> 01:17:58,412
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and I think it's okay for me to say I am a fan of both the DS and the PSP.

1016
01:17:58,813 --> 01:17:59,714
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing wrong with that.

1017
01:17:59,874 --> 01:18:00,494
[SPEAKER_02]: I like them both.

1018
01:18:01,155 --> 01:18:01,575
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.

1019
01:18:01,675 --> 01:18:07,079
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to buy a PSP once Sony fixes all the kinks, and I'll wait for a second or third generation unit.

1020
01:18:07,279 --> 01:18:11,002
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just not a fan of the price of the PSP, but I'll get over it.

1021
01:18:11,082 --> 01:18:14,825
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll get over it eventually.

1022
01:18:15,105 --> 01:18:15,845
[SPEAKER_04]: $250, please.

1023
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:18,587
[SPEAKER_02]: We couldn't even buy them when they came out.

1024
01:18:18,727 --> 01:18:21,850
[SPEAKER_04]: If it came with Luminous packed in, that would so be worth it.

1025
01:18:22,410 --> 01:18:22,770
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1026
01:18:23,411 --> 01:18:23,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1027
01:18:24,173 --> 01:18:25,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well I'm going to let you go.

1028
01:18:25,256 --> 01:18:25,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one, buddy.

1029
01:18:26,438 --> 01:18:26,739
[SPEAKER_04]: You too.

1030
01:18:26,799 --> 01:18:27,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy the rest of the week.

1031
01:18:27,541 --> 01:18:29,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for calling.

1032
01:18:29,324 --> 01:18:30,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good week.

1033
01:18:30,627 --> 01:18:30,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

1034
01:18:31,810 --> 01:18:33,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see if we can get in one more call at least.

1035
01:18:33,413 --> 01:18:34,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

1036
01:18:35,663 --> 01:18:36,984
[SPEAKER_25]: Hey, SSJ100 Matt here.

1037
01:18:37,144 --> 01:18:38,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, SSJ100 Matt.

1038
01:18:38,365 --> 01:18:38,945
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind?

1039
01:18:40,026 --> 01:18:40,746
[SPEAKER_25]: Nothing.

1040
01:18:41,467 --> 01:18:42,808
[SPEAKER_25]: I guess I was going to beat you to the punch.

1041
01:18:42,828 --> 01:18:46,090
[SPEAKER_25]: I was going to talk about the Dear Friends.

1042
01:18:46,890 --> 01:18:47,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, yes, that's right.

1043
01:18:47,591 --> 01:18:48,531
[SPEAKER_04]: You were the one that sent that to me.

1044
01:18:48,551 --> 01:18:51,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I was going to make a mention of this after the segment, but that's okay.

1045
01:18:52,354 --> 01:18:52,694
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1046
01:18:53,174 --> 01:18:55,376
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on with the Dear Friends?

1047
01:18:55,556 --> 01:18:57,497
[SPEAKER_04]: What's this news you found out about Dear Friends?

1048
01:18:58,018 --> 01:19:01,559
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I just found out about this earlier this weekend.

1049
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:06,500
[SPEAKER_25]: It turns out that the Dear Friends Fallen Fantasy concert is coming to the East Coast.

1050
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:14,781
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and like, we're not talking Chicago, which to some of us in California, Chicago counts as East Coast, but not really to the rest of America.

1051
01:19:15,161 --> 01:19:21,222
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, now it's actually going to be in an East Coast state, so some of you guys are going to be able to catch this.

1052
01:19:21,302 --> 01:19:23,583
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you have some of the details you want to tell our listeners?

1053
01:19:24,423 --> 01:19:24,523
[SPEAKER_25]: Um...

1054
01:19:26,004 --> 01:19:28,066
[SPEAKER_25]: They're going to not be in the major cities.

1055
01:19:28,086 --> 01:19:31,170
[SPEAKER_25]: They're going to be in corners of the East Coast.

1056
01:19:32,011 --> 01:19:35,295
[SPEAKER_25]: First one is going to be on May 20th in Hartford, Connecticut.

1057
01:19:36,416 --> 01:19:36,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.

1058
01:19:37,197 --> 01:19:38,398
[SPEAKER_04]: I have friends who live in Connecticut.

1059
01:19:38,498 --> 01:19:39,860
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll be happy about that information.

1060
01:19:40,273 --> 01:19:40,473
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

1061
01:19:41,374 --> 01:19:46,038
[SPEAKER_25]: And in June 24th and the 25th, Atlanta, Georgia is going to have it.

1062
01:19:46,358 --> 01:19:48,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so some Southeast fun there.

1063
01:19:48,299 --> 01:19:48,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1064
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:56,266
[SPEAKER_25]: And then for some reason they put in San Diego for East Coast touring.

1065
01:19:56,706 --> 01:19:58,347
[SPEAKER_07]: San Diego, North Carolina.

1066
01:19:59,548 --> 01:20:02,191
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's San Diego, California is getting another show.

1067
01:20:02,231 --> 01:20:03,492
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

1068
01:20:03,552 --> 01:20:06,934
[SPEAKER_04]: So for those of you that maybe missed out on a previous L.A.

1069
01:20:06,954 --> 01:20:07,855
[SPEAKER_04]: show, here's your chance.

1070
01:20:07,875 --> 01:20:08,756
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go to San Diego.

1071
01:20:08,776 --> 01:20:08,916
[SPEAKER_25]: It's up.

1072
01:20:09,557 --> 01:20:10,857
[SPEAKER_25]: That's going to be July 14th.

1073
01:20:10,897 --> 01:20:15,899
[SPEAKER_25]: And then July 23rd and the 24th, they're going to have it in Detroit.

1074
01:20:16,839 --> 01:20:17,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

1075
01:20:17,399 --> 01:20:19,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Try not to get shot at that concert, by the way.

1076
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:20,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I won't go to that one.

1077
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,180
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll go to the Hartford one.

1078
01:20:22,220 --> 01:20:22,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

1079
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:25,041
[SPEAKER_04]: I have friends in Connecticut who would be interested in going.

1080
01:20:25,501 --> 01:20:28,021
[SPEAKER_04]: If I had time off work, I would go, but I won't.

1081
01:20:28,742 --> 01:20:29,222
[SPEAKER_25]: And the money.

1082
01:20:29,662 --> 01:20:31,082
[SPEAKER_04]: And money, yeah, absolutely.

1083
01:20:32,022 --> 01:20:35,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking forward, though, to the More Friends concert that's going to be happening in L.A.

1084
01:20:35,303 --> 01:20:37,584
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have tickets, so I'm very excited about that.

1085
01:20:37,644 --> 01:20:38,324
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see what happens.

1086
01:20:39,517 --> 01:20:52,582
[SPEAKER_25]: But, yep, um, ad here, I'm waiting for In The Groove to finally come I mean, it's been sitting in a DDR4th Mix case for about two months And it's just not working, or?

1087
01:20:53,322 --> 01:21:04,587
[SPEAKER_25]: No, they just have, they have, like, the logo for In The Groove and everything on it And they still just have 4th Mix playing on it Somebody's too lazy to get in there and switch it over

1088
01:21:05,307 --> 01:21:06,288
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, it's Golfland.

1089
01:21:06,308 --> 01:21:07,549
[SPEAKER_25]: You guys know what I'm talking about.

1090
01:21:07,569 --> 01:21:08,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, okay, okay.

1091
01:21:08,950 --> 01:21:10,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, I didn't know Golfland existed on the East Coast.

1092
01:21:11,431 --> 01:21:12,612
[SPEAKER_25]: No, it's Arizona.

1093
01:21:12,712 --> 01:21:15,534
[SPEAKER_25]: No, I'm from the East Coast, but I'm going to school in Arizona.

1094
01:21:15,714 --> 01:21:16,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotcha.

1095
01:21:16,275 --> 01:21:16,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm sorry.

1096
01:21:16,935 --> 01:21:17,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, gotcha.

1097
01:21:18,256 --> 01:21:18,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

1098
01:21:19,477 --> 01:21:20,457
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of... Okay.

1099
01:21:20,898 --> 01:21:23,559
[SPEAKER_04]: So they've got in the groove just sitting there waiting to go.

1100
01:21:23,660 --> 01:21:24,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well...

1101
01:21:24,591 --> 01:21:28,792
[SPEAKER_04]: In the Groove, you know, for me, there's good things about it and there's bad things about it.

1102
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:30,113
[SPEAKER_04]: I've said this just about every week.

1103
01:21:30,233 --> 01:21:37,275
[SPEAKER_04]: I find it very interesting what's going on on the Freak right now, over on DDR Freak, about their April Fool's post.

1104
01:21:37,895 --> 01:21:44,897
[SPEAKER_04]: They've turned into these huge In the Groove vs. DDR messes, and I'm just kind of like, can't we all just get along?

1105
01:21:46,958 --> 01:21:50,221
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's things to like and things to not like about both games.

1106
01:21:50,341 --> 01:21:51,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody can improve a little bit.

1107
01:21:52,042 --> 01:22:01,008
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I really don't like that attitude, though, when folks, you know, I guess this is the one thing I will say kind of against in the group, but it's not really the game itself so much as the fan base.

1108
01:22:01,369 --> 01:22:06,713
[SPEAKER_04]: But I really hate it when people come on and go, ah, DDR's dead, time to move on.

1109
01:22:07,639 --> 01:22:13,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, okay, didn't they just release a press release in January that said DDR sold a million copies?

1110
01:22:13,722 --> 01:22:15,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, DDR is like really dead.

1111
01:22:15,543 --> 01:22:21,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe DDR is dead in the arcades, but that's only because, you know, Konami's stupid, for lack of a better term.

1112
01:22:22,026 --> 01:22:24,527
[SPEAKER_04]: But as far as the home releases go, DDR is far from dead.

1113
01:22:25,268 --> 01:22:30,130
[SPEAKER_04]: And I firmly believe that DDR will continue to own In the Groove on the home releases.

1114
01:22:30,810 --> 01:22:36,513
[SPEAKER_04]: But In the Groove is going to pick up the arcade stuff if DDR doesn't do anything, so it's going to be interesting.

1115
01:22:39,326 --> 01:22:40,988
[SPEAKER_25]: No, I'm just anxious to try it.

1116
01:22:41,028 --> 01:22:41,668
[SPEAKER_25]: That's it.

1117
01:22:41,688 --> 01:22:43,050
[SPEAKER_25]: Because everyone's talking about it.

1118
01:22:43,150 --> 01:22:46,314
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'm just wondering if the hype's what it is.

1119
01:22:46,955 --> 01:22:49,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you'll have to let us know what you think once you get a chance to try it out.

1120
01:22:49,638 --> 01:22:49,978
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

1121
01:22:50,278 --> 01:22:50,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1122
01:22:52,225 --> 01:22:55,447
[SPEAKER_25]: Yep, I'm watching the Yankee game and listening to you guys.

1123
01:22:56,008 --> 01:22:57,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, sounds good.

1124
01:22:58,030 --> 01:23:01,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well enjoy the game and I guess we'll talk to you another time.

1125
01:23:01,513 --> 01:23:01,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright?

1126
01:23:02,374 --> 01:23:02,954
[SPEAKER_25]: Yep, take it easy.

1127
01:23:03,014 --> 01:23:03,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, have a good one.

1128
01:23:03,835 --> 01:23:04,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye.

1129
01:23:05,176 --> 01:23:06,938
[SPEAKER_21]: Watching the game, having a bud.

1130
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:09,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Sitting back.

1131
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:10,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasabi!

1132
01:23:10,321 --> 01:23:11,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Smoking a bud.

1133
01:23:11,142 --> 01:23:11,622
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm kidding.

1134
01:23:12,743 --> 01:23:13,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1135
01:23:15,306 --> 01:23:16,086
[SPEAKER_21]: Wasabi!

1136
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:21,762
[SPEAKER_21]: I watched the sushi restaurant version of the What's Up last night.

1137
01:23:23,062 --> 01:23:23,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, really?

1138
01:23:23,723 --> 01:23:24,083
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1139
01:23:25,463 --> 01:23:28,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that on the internet for download?

1140
01:23:29,205 --> 01:23:36,228
[SPEAKER_21]: When I was at Iguana Girls last night, we were going through some of her old discs, and it was one of the things on there, too, along with Tokyo Breakfast.

1141
01:23:37,725 --> 01:23:39,769
[SPEAKER_04]: And the edited picture of Quasimodo.

1142
01:23:49,392 --> 01:23:55,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, that was posted on Iguana Girls Journal earlier, which made me laugh, because... That was an old DDR freak joke.

1143
01:23:55,674 --> 01:23:56,915
[SPEAKER_04]: That was an old-ass joke, yeah.

1144
01:23:57,175 --> 01:23:57,635
[SPEAKER_04]: But funny.

1145
01:23:59,156 --> 01:24:00,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody knows what the hell we're talking about, so forget it.

1146
01:24:01,497 --> 01:24:05,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just move on to... We're going to go ahead and close up the skyline for now.

1147
01:24:05,358 --> 01:24:07,679
[SPEAKER_04]: If you didn't get through, try again later, okay?

1148
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:13,902
[SPEAKER_04]: What we're going to do now, though, is we're going to move on to the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match!

1149
01:24:14,682 --> 01:24:14,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo-hoo!

1150
01:24:19,850 --> 01:24:25,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio cage match, we had a champion for two weeks in a row.

1151
01:24:26,819 --> 01:24:30,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Yoko Kanno went into the second week of victory with Rise.

1152
01:24:30,965 --> 01:24:33,028
[SPEAKER_04]: So will she be able to make it three weeks?

1153
01:24:33,188 --> 01:24:34,129
[SPEAKER_04]: We shall find out.

1154
01:24:35,303 --> 01:24:40,806
[SPEAKER_04]: The way the cage match works, for those of you guys who haven't listened before, we do three songs against each other.

1155
01:24:40,866 --> 01:24:43,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Each host picks a song and it does battle.

1156
01:24:43,527 --> 01:24:47,589
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are the ones that ultimately vote for the winner, so you have to be in our chat room to participate.

1157
01:24:48,129 --> 01:24:52,011
[SPEAKER_04]: www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat.

1158
01:24:52,291 --> 01:24:57,134
[SPEAKER_04]: You only get to hear a clip of last week's winner, because you already heard it last week.

1159
01:24:57,594 --> 01:25:03,777
[SPEAKER_04]: So here it is, a clip of last week's winner, song number one, Yoko Kanno with Rise.

1160
01:25:03,837 --> 01:25:04,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy.

1161
01:26:54,776 --> 01:26:58,618
Thank you for watching!

1162
01:27:28,445 --> 01:27:33,230
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a little pissed off at how poorly received Kelly Clarkson was last week.

1163
01:27:33,250 --> 01:27:34,150
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've decided...

1164
01:27:51,015 --> 01:27:53,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Screw you guys, I'm putting in Britney Spears.

1165
01:27:55,039 --> 01:28:03,588
[SPEAKER_04]: So here it is, song number two, from me to you with love, Britney Spears with Every Time, the Valentin remix.

1166
01:28:49,288 --> 01:29:06,613
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel so small, I guess I need you, baby I'm running from the deep, moving my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you, baby Baby, baby Baby

1167
01:29:58,030 --> 01:30:12,055
[SPEAKER_13]: You make my dreams, I see your face, your heart is in me, I guess I need you baby I may have made a mistake, please look at me, my weakness caused your pain

1168
01:30:28,729 --> 01:30:35,994
[SPEAKER_13]: And every time I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small

1169
01:31:00,015 --> 01:31:02,359
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

1170
01:31:25,777 --> 01:31:28,900
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.

1171
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:30,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Britney Spears!

1172
01:31:31,302 --> 01:31:33,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time, can't wait to hear the votes on this one.

1173
01:31:33,745 --> 01:31:36,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go around, start it off with DarkSakura.

1174
01:31:38,309 --> 01:31:41,973
[SPEAKER_21]: Minus 57, because it's Britney Spears.

1175
01:31:41,993 --> 01:31:47,399
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know, the music was okay, it was just like, hi, I'm Clicky Cutter Pop.

1176
01:31:48,985 --> 01:31:50,726
[SPEAKER_21]: And it made me feel nauseous.

1177
01:31:51,926 --> 01:31:55,968
[SPEAKER_21]: So much that not even a coconut cream pie would bring back my appetite.

1178
01:31:56,508 --> 01:31:57,249
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry, Rob.

1179
01:31:57,869 --> 01:31:59,450
[SPEAKER_04]: That was... That's alright.

1180
01:31:59,490 --> 01:32:00,910
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to take it personally tonight.

1181
01:32:00,930 --> 01:32:01,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Just awful.

1182
01:32:01,590 --> 01:32:01,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1183
01:32:02,931 --> 01:32:03,651
[SPEAKER_21]: Beyond awful.

1184
01:32:03,851 --> 01:32:04,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1185
01:32:04,091 --> 01:32:04,952
[SPEAKER_21]: Here, Julie, rate this thing.

1186
01:32:05,292 --> 01:32:07,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Negative 57 from DarkSakura.

1187
01:32:07,973 --> 01:32:09,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me go to Loki, then we'll get to Julie.

1188
01:32:09,334 --> 01:32:09,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki!

1189
01:32:10,495 --> 01:32:13,036
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that didn't even really sound like Britney Spears to me.

1190
01:32:13,596 --> 01:32:16,416
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, it just didn't sound like it to me.

1191
01:32:16,816 --> 01:32:21,257
[SPEAKER_05]: But I hate her because she ruined my prerogatives, so... Amen!

1192
01:32:21,618 --> 01:32:23,338
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, she gets a minus one.

1193
01:32:23,498 --> 01:32:25,798
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to go as far as 57 because that's just ridiculous.

1194
01:32:27,419 --> 01:32:28,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Julie!

1195
01:32:28,839 --> 01:32:29,519
[SPEAKER_26]: I go with minus 58.

1196
01:32:29,939 --> 01:32:32,500
[SPEAKER_26]: I just had to be the one giving her the lowest score of all.

1197
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:33,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1198
01:32:33,860 --> 01:32:34,700
[SPEAKER_26]: Because it's just fitting.

1199
01:32:35,461 --> 01:32:35,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.

1200
01:32:36,561 --> 01:32:36,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Angel!

1201
01:32:39,392 --> 01:32:39,772
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

1202
01:32:40,513 --> 01:32:41,694
[SPEAKER_19]: Just no.

1203
01:32:42,975 --> 01:32:45,637
[SPEAKER_19]: You ruined my something or other.

1204
01:32:46,178 --> 01:32:52,363
[SPEAKER_19]: God, just, um, negative infinity.

1205
01:32:54,925 --> 01:32:56,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Loki's going to change his vote.

1206
01:32:56,827 --> 01:33:01,430
[SPEAKER_05]: My vote is going to be 158 plus infinity, so it's an even zero for that song.

1207
01:33:03,892 --> 01:33:04,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up!

1208
01:33:04,633 --> 01:33:05,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, um...

1209
01:33:06,627 --> 01:33:09,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Me, personally, I will be the only one to give it a positive score.

1210
01:33:09,889 --> 01:33:11,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, I'm the one to put that in there.

1211
01:33:11,750 --> 01:33:15,953
[SPEAKER_04]: I give that song a 7, because, you know, it's not that bad.

1212
01:33:17,093 --> 01:33:20,275
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a dance remix, and like Loki said, it barely sounds like Britney at all.

1213
01:33:20,915 --> 01:33:21,476
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?

1214
01:33:21,516 --> 01:33:22,476
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys earned it.

1215
01:33:23,037 --> 01:33:24,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Taint of evil, Rob.

1216
01:33:24,498 --> 01:33:25,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Taint of evil.

1217
01:33:25,618 --> 01:33:26,339
[SPEAKER_04]: You earned it.

1218
01:33:26,759 --> 01:33:27,279
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?

1219
01:33:27,359 --> 01:33:30,901
[SPEAKER_04]: It was worth it alone for the chatroom's reaction, honestly.

1220
01:33:31,322 --> 01:33:32,742
[SPEAKER_04]: I should do that more often.

1221
01:33:32,802 --> 01:33:33,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the encouragement.

1222
01:33:34,423 --> 01:33:35,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, uh...

1223
01:33:36,209 --> 01:33:38,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into song number three, Loki!

1224
01:33:39,952 --> 01:33:43,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, um, now this song, I made it for a couple reasons.

1225
01:33:44,156 --> 01:34:01,772
[SPEAKER_05]: One, uh, well, first off, the song I made, okay, um, this is, basically, I found this Max remix on Barmani Style by this guy named DJ Pato, he's like some Spanish guy, and he really sucks at making remixes, and he made this song called Max Extension, which is retarded,

1226
01:34:02,412 --> 01:34:09,614
[SPEAKER_05]: But it had this really cool song in the background in it, and I was like, you know, hey, that'd be a pretty cool song to make a Max remix out of, so that's what I did.

1227
01:34:09,934 --> 01:34:22,778
[SPEAKER_05]: So, adding to my next installment of, you know, the Legend of Trance series, this is also, this was supposed to be because my original thought for the April Fool's joke was going to be Max 300 Radio, and this was going to debut at the end.

1228
01:34:23,738 --> 01:34:43,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that didn't happen, so... Um, and it's... Well, this would... The song would be called Legend of Techno, but that's just retarded, and since I already have, you know, Legend of Trance and Legend of Trance 2004, this is Legend of Trance 2005 with the new synonym Maximum GX, and, you know, the song's remixed from F-Zero TX, so... Enjoy!

1229
01:34:45,384 --> 01:34:50,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Here it is, Loki's putting in... And I know you guys hate Max remixes, but... Livs.

1230
01:34:51,573 --> 01:34:52,375
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, here it is.

1231
01:34:52,575 --> 01:34:54,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki is putting in his own creation.

1232
01:34:55,460 --> 01:34:56,782
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Max remix.

1233
01:34:56,882 --> 01:35:00,508
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Maximum GX with Legend of Trance 2005.

1234
01:35:00,669 --> 01:35:01,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is, song number three.

1235
01:35:55,976 --> 01:35:56,844
Thanks for watching!

1236
01:36:31,167 --> 01:36:31,929
Thanks for watching!

1237
01:37:41,786 --> 01:37:44,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number three, Legend of Trance, 2005.

1238
01:37:45,067 --> 01:37:46,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what they thought of it.

1239
01:37:46,328 --> 01:37:47,328
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

1240
01:37:48,848 --> 01:37:50,829
[SPEAKER_21]: My head hurts!

1241
01:37:52,790 --> 01:37:53,050
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1242
01:37:53,770 --> 01:37:55,831
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, it was, I'm sorry, it was Max.

1243
01:37:57,431 --> 01:37:58,292
[SPEAKER_21]: It made my head hurt.

1244
01:37:59,392 --> 01:37:59,912
[SPEAKER_21]: I twitched.

1245
01:38:01,713 --> 01:38:03,714
[SPEAKER_21]: But it's not Britney Spears, so it gets a seven.

1246
01:38:03,734 --> 01:38:06,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Loki.

1247
01:38:07,995 --> 01:38:08,635
[SPEAKER_05]: It's okay.

1248
01:38:09,296 --> 01:38:10,116
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I tried.

1249
01:38:11,027 --> 01:38:17,213
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't care, just gonna play the song later anyway, so... It gets a 9, because I made it.

1250
01:38:19,215 --> 01:38:20,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Is Julie got a mic?

1251
01:38:20,356 --> 01:38:21,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Can Julie give it a rank there?

1252
01:38:22,278 --> 01:38:24,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's... Here comes Julie.

1253
01:38:26,842 --> 01:38:29,484
[SPEAKER_27]: I give that song... Hmm... A 2.

1254
01:38:29,645 --> 01:38:31,186
[SPEAKER_27]: I really wasn't paying much attention though.

1255
01:38:31,346 --> 01:38:31,827
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sorry.

1256
01:38:32,427 --> 01:38:33,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's alright.

1257
01:38:34,429 --> 01:38:35,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I give it...

1258
01:38:37,296 --> 01:38:37,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Angel

1259
01:38:59,929 --> 01:39:07,160
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, I'd like to give the whole, um, Initial D soundtrack a big fat zero because your beat sucks ass!

1260
01:39:08,723 --> 01:39:09,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, now.

1261
01:39:10,345 --> 01:39:10,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, now.

1262
01:39:11,587 --> 01:39:14,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get angry just because you entered a Max Remix.

1263
01:39:14,231 --> 01:39:14,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Angel!

1264
01:39:16,420 --> 01:39:22,782
[SPEAKER_19]: Good beats and stuff in there, but it's Max, and I'm not... I don't know.

1265
01:39:22,962 --> 01:39:29,644
[SPEAKER_19]: I just... I can't deal with regular Max or whatever, so... I'll be nice and give it a 7.

1266
01:39:30,524 --> 01:39:37,006
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, if you wanted to make a good mix, you could do, like, Legend of Butt or something.

1267
01:39:37,306 --> 01:39:42,248
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the fact that three of us said, it's a good remix, but it's Max.

1268
01:39:43,848 --> 01:39:44,849
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you people...

1269
01:39:45,669 --> 01:39:48,531
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, Drew, Carameldansen

1270
01:40:13,783 --> 01:40:19,665
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no doubt you made a better remix than this other guy, but I want Max... I want... You know what?

1271
01:40:20,925 --> 01:40:21,705
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what we should do?

1272
01:40:22,345 --> 01:40:25,626
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to get DJ Paranoia on the show, and I think we could arrange it.

1273
01:40:26,526 --> 01:40:31,487
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want him to say on air that they will ban Max remixes from the Stepmania catalog.

1274
01:40:32,148 --> 01:40:35,288
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what we have to do to him to get him to do that, but I think we need that to happen.

1275
01:40:36,689 --> 01:40:37,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that's possible?

1276
01:40:38,569 --> 01:40:41,310
[SPEAKER_04]: That if the name Max is in the title of the song, it's banned.

1277
01:40:42,009 --> 01:40:45,152
[SPEAKER_20]: We have to curse him.

1278
01:40:45,833 --> 01:40:46,733
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have to do something.

1279
01:40:47,054 --> 01:40:48,715
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to see if I can get a hold of him.

1280
01:40:49,416 --> 01:40:52,779
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what we have to bribe him with, but I want it done.

1281
01:40:52,939 --> 01:40:54,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Ice cream!

1282
01:40:54,921 --> 01:40:56,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Ice cream is a winner.

1283
01:40:56,222 --> 01:40:57,523
[SPEAKER_04]: We can send him lots of ice cream.

1284
01:40:57,824 --> 01:40:58,624
[SPEAKER_21]: Lots of ice cream.

1285
01:40:59,205 --> 01:41:02,288
[SPEAKER_05]: It means my song will still be on there because it's named Legend of Trance.

1286
01:41:02,808 --> 01:41:04,390
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no Max in the title at all.

1287
01:41:05,428 --> 01:41:09,389
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll send Girl Scout cookies to Boaz.

1288
01:41:09,409 --> 01:41:10,809
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm seriously going to get in touch with him.

1289
01:41:11,429 --> 01:41:11,910
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1290
01:41:11,930 --> 01:41:13,890
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll send him Girl Scouts to service him.

1291
01:41:14,310 --> 01:41:17,531
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's recap the songs you can vote for tonight.

1292
01:41:17,611 --> 01:41:19,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number one, Yoko Kono.

1293
01:41:20,351 --> 01:41:22,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I almost said like Yoko Ono.

1294
01:41:22,632 --> 01:41:24,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Yoko Kono.

1295
01:41:25,293 --> 01:41:26,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Yoko Kono with Rise.

1296
01:41:34,457 --> 01:41:37,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number two, Britney Spears, Every Time, the Valentin remix.

1297
01:41:46,586 --> 01:41:51,030
[SPEAKER_04]: And song number three you can vote for tonight is Maximum GX with The Legend of Trance, 2005.

1298
01:41:51,090 --> 01:41:51,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Maximum GX

1299
01:42:00,558 --> 01:42:03,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Place vote now!

1300
01:42:03,221 --> 01:42:12,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote for song number one, song number two, or song number three.

1301
01:42:13,171 --> 01:42:14,852
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, send a private message.

1302
01:42:14,892 --> 01:42:18,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, if you post your, um, vote publicly in the chat room, that's great.

1303
01:42:18,977 --> 01:42:21,179
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll be trying to swear, uh, swear, swear,

1304
01:42:21,559 --> 01:42:23,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Sway other people to vote the way you would.

1305
01:42:23,921 --> 01:42:26,303
[SPEAKER_04]: However, it doesn't count unless I get it in private message.

1306
01:42:26,323 --> 01:42:30,848
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're not sure how to send a private message, just ask nicely and somebody in the chatroom will fill you in.

1307
01:42:30,868 --> 01:42:32,429
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we have a whole little op team.

1308
01:42:32,829 --> 01:42:33,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Your ops will help you out.

1309
01:42:34,371 --> 01:42:41,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, this is usually the part of the show where I ask Loki what the hell's going on in the sim scene besides unnecessary Max remixes.

1310
01:42:41,918 --> 01:42:43,399
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know there's quite a bit going on this week.

1311
01:42:43,419 --> 01:42:45,661
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some very colorful things going on.

1312
01:42:45,701 --> 01:42:46,302
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's up?

1313
01:42:47,785 --> 01:42:55,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, first off, I'd like to mention there's a comment thing under DJ Pato's new remix, which is Max Life Superior Cancer Mix.

1314
01:42:56,191 --> 01:42:59,453
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what the fuck that is, but I love his comment.

1315
01:42:59,493 --> 01:43:01,215
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the best, like, comment right here.

1316
01:43:01,595 --> 01:43:06,458
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, Alex Calderia and Badass, they must meet to eat shit.

1317
01:43:08,199 --> 01:43:12,743
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what that means, but the whole quote, they must meet to eat shit, is funny.

1318
01:43:13,083 --> 01:43:13,403
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1319
01:43:13,603 --> 01:43:14,544
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyways, um...

1320
01:43:15,552 --> 01:43:16,072
[SPEAKER_05]: I digress.

1321
01:43:16,813 --> 01:43:18,133
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but April Fool's Day.

1322
01:43:19,274 --> 01:43:24,497
[SPEAKER_05]: You're only a fool if you didn't download these packs because there are so many being released it's not even funny.

1323
01:43:25,097 --> 01:43:31,321
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the release of D3 Mix 2, which is just another DDR, like, you know, food mix type thing.

1324
01:43:31,341 --> 01:43:33,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice little 186 meg file there.

1325
01:43:33,022 --> 01:43:33,342
[SPEAKER_05]: We had LFT Mix 2.

1326
01:43:40,246 --> 01:43:48,371
[SPEAKER_05]: All of these are just like Food Mix.

1327
01:43:48,391 --> 01:43:50,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Strawberry Steps actually has the videos just like Food Mix.

1328
01:43:51,593 --> 01:43:56,357
[SPEAKER_05]: All really good stuff to download to at least play while you're waiting for Food Mix 2 to come out.

1329
01:43:56,517 --> 01:43:57,718
[SPEAKER_05]: So, check those out.

1330
01:43:57,738 --> 01:44:02,061
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're looking for links, there's a whole thread on Bomani Style under the

1331
01:44:02,681 --> 01:44:13,509
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1332
01:44:30,911 --> 01:44:34,094
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot better than ours, like most everything else.

1333
01:44:34,114 --> 01:44:36,696
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what's going on.

1334
01:44:36,956 --> 01:44:39,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and DDRUK, I mentioned they were coming up April 1st.

1335
01:44:39,819 --> 01:44:41,580
[SPEAKER_05]: There was an April Fool's joke, sort of.

1336
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:42,261
[SPEAKER_05]: They're coming up.

1337
01:44:43,181 --> 01:44:45,463
[SPEAKER_05]: They're actually launching Monday.

1338
01:44:45,924 --> 01:44:48,706
[SPEAKER_05]: So look for DDRUK to come in back.

1339
01:44:49,887 --> 01:44:54,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't their April Fool's joke something about, oh, Konami supports us now, like any of us would believe that?

1340
01:44:54,881 --> 01:45:01,944
[SPEAKER_05]: No, their actual April Fool's joke was they were going to be Dancing Stage Fusion UK or something like that.

1341
01:45:02,624 --> 01:45:03,505
[SPEAKER_05]: It was for a little bit.

1342
01:45:03,585 --> 01:45:04,305
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really stupid.

1343
01:45:06,006 --> 01:45:07,106
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was up there.

1344
01:45:07,606 --> 01:45:10,588
[SPEAKER_05]: But as far as I'm aware, they didn't do an April Fool's thing.

1345
01:45:10,868 --> 01:45:14,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably because last year was kind of retarded, but I don't know.

1346
01:45:15,029 --> 01:45:18,751
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, DDRUK is coming up tomorrow, supposedly.

1347
01:45:19,844 --> 01:45:25,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, at least their joke wasn't something really stupid like getting bought by another media corporation or something.

1348
01:45:25,410 --> 01:45:26,411
[SPEAKER_04]: That would just be stupid.

1349
01:45:26,531 --> 01:45:27,972
[SPEAKER_04]: So at least it was Konami.

1350
01:45:30,014 --> 01:45:32,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that would suck.

1351
01:45:35,599 --> 01:45:40,102
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, nothing really going on in the sim scene other than, you know, more Max remixes that suck.

1352
01:45:40,722 --> 01:45:45,564
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I've got to put a new one out every now and then just because, you know, I... I don't know.

1353
01:45:46,304 --> 01:45:57,790
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been trying to make some other stuff, but, you know, this song... Usually, when I make stuff, it's usually to make something that's better than someone else's stuff, so... Blame it on them.

1354
01:45:57,830 --> 01:46:01,471
[SPEAKER_05]: If they wouldn't put the stupid sim files out, I wouldn't get inspiration to make another Max remix.

1355
01:46:02,352 --> 01:46:02,952
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all their fault.

1356
01:46:04,957 --> 01:46:17,065
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to write him an email as soon as this show's over and say, we want to interview you, we want to talk to you about a very serious issue facing the Mimani community and then spring it that we want to ban Max Remixes.

1357
01:46:17,986 --> 01:46:22,849
[SPEAKER_04]: And we need his help because that site only perpetuates, encourages people to make Max Remixes.

1358
01:46:23,558 --> 01:46:24,798
[SPEAKER_05]: What about Paranoia remixes?

1359
01:46:25,939 --> 01:46:26,419
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1360
01:46:26,479 --> 01:46:29,880
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't had my limit of that yet, although I'm getting very close.

1361
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:36,262
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, in a perfect world, we would ban Max remixes, Paranoia remixes, and there's another one.

1362
01:46:36,642 --> 01:46:36,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

1363
01:46:37,122 --> 01:46:37,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Drop?

1364
01:46:37,542 --> 01:46:38,282
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not Dropout.

1365
01:46:38,302 --> 01:46:39,703
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another one that needs to be stopped.

1366
01:46:40,543 --> 01:46:45,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Sakura?

1367
01:46:45,225 --> 01:46:45,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Sakura.

1368
01:46:46,125 --> 01:46:48,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Sakura's kind of another version of Max 300, though.

1369
01:46:49,026 --> 01:46:50,606
[SPEAKER_21]: But Sakura is awesome.

1370
01:46:51,466 --> 01:46:52,067
[SPEAKER_04]: The original?

1371
01:46:52,547 --> 01:46:52,727
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1372
01:46:52,747 --> 01:46:53,407
[SPEAKER_04]: But not remixes.

1373
01:46:54,284 --> 01:47:06,893
[SPEAKER_21]: I haven't really heard too many remixes, but nothing could... You know, I can't really consider Sakura a version of Max 300 just because it's so awesome on its own, but... Only because it shares an entire bass line for Max 300?

1374
01:47:07,894 --> 01:47:11,856
[SPEAKER_21]: But it has the other... that makes it instantly cool.

1375
01:47:11,876 --> 01:47:12,757
[SPEAKER_21]: Ah, whatever.

1376
01:47:13,117 --> 01:47:17,901
[SPEAKER_05]: They're gonna make Banjo 300 or something like that, and they'll just have a banjo over the... That would be awesome!

1377
01:47:17,981 --> 01:47:18,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Banjo 300!

1378
01:47:18,421 --> 01:47:19,302
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought of it.

1379
01:47:19,322 --> 01:47:19,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Bag.

1380
01:47:21,576 --> 01:47:25,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, you don't hear a whole lot of bag remixes, but people that try to remix it try to be funny.

1381
01:47:25,639 --> 01:47:26,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually it's like Bag Survivor.

1382
01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:30,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything with Survivor in the title.

1383
01:47:30,262 --> 01:47:30,722
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

1384
01:47:31,323 --> 01:47:32,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything with Survivor.

1385
01:47:33,364 --> 01:47:35,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless it's the Destiny's Child song.

1386
01:47:35,145 --> 01:47:37,607
[SPEAKER_04]: And even then, I think somebody already did it, so we don't need any more.

1387
01:47:37,727 --> 01:47:38,648
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that's it.

1388
01:47:39,769 --> 01:47:41,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless maybe you're going to do Eye of the Tiger.

1389
01:47:41,590 --> 01:47:42,591
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if anybody's done that.

1390
01:47:42,851 --> 01:47:43,691
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be okay.

1391
01:47:44,172 --> 01:47:46,994
[SPEAKER_04]: But I want all cowgirl Survivor.

1392
01:47:47,998 --> 01:47:51,545
[SPEAKER_04]: TheSevenJump, Survivor, LetThemMove, Survivor, I want that shit stopped.

1393
01:47:56,855 --> 01:47:59,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just point out, and to further...

1394
01:48:00,836 --> 01:48:02,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob's argument about bad Max remixes.

1395
01:48:02,998 --> 01:48:09,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just read to you the latest Max remixes that are being released right now.

1396
01:48:09,203 --> 01:48:22,754
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Max Borg Assimilation, Max Life Superior Cancer Mix, The Legend of Max OTLK Version, Max Unlimited, Sakura Max Unlimited 300, Max Fantasia Version 3, meaning there's been two more before that.

1397
01:48:23,174 --> 01:48:29,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Max 300, The Wacko Reflex Remix, Paranoid Survivor Max, Max Energy High Voltage Remix,

1398
01:48:30,680 --> 01:48:39,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Unlimited Legends of Max Version 2, Max Extension, 2 Max 330 And that, now I'm going to cut you off right there because that is just in the past week.

1399
01:48:40,468 --> 01:48:41,689
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just in the past week.

1400
01:48:43,491 --> 01:48:44,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking stop, people.

1401
01:48:46,213 --> 01:48:46,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

1402
01:48:48,535 --> 01:48:51,917
[SPEAKER_04]: And then like you go into the week before, Love Love Shine Survivor Max.

1403
01:48:51,957 --> 01:48:52,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just what we needed.

1404
01:48:53,539 --> 01:48:53,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Ass.

1405
01:48:56,727 --> 01:48:59,931
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get to the cage match winner in a little bit, but first we're going to go to a quickie break.

1406
01:49:01,493 --> 01:49:03,716
[SPEAKER_04]: And in this break, Max remixes!

1407
01:49:04,157 --> 01:49:04,798
[SPEAKER_04]: No, just kidding.

1408
01:49:05,419 --> 01:49:09,965
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do, I don't know, I want to do a song that really doesn't suck.

1409
01:49:10,065 --> 01:49:12,889
[SPEAKER_04]: What's a song like that just doesn't suck?

1410
01:49:14,161 --> 01:49:14,741
[SPEAKER_21]: From what?

1411
01:49:16,203 --> 01:49:17,223
[SPEAKER_04]: How about the original Sakura?

1412
01:49:17,263 --> 01:49:17,804
[SPEAKER_04]: We can do the original.

1413
01:49:17,824 --> 01:49:18,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, play Sakura.

1414
01:49:18,344 --> 01:49:19,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we'll do that.

1415
01:49:20,286 --> 01:49:25,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though it's kind of Max, but you're right, it's got the extra something something that makes it a little better.

1416
01:49:26,390 --> 01:49:27,071
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do Zenon.

1417
01:49:27,551 --> 01:49:27,971
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.

1418
01:49:28,031 --> 01:49:29,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm liking these ideas.

1419
01:49:30,073 --> 01:49:31,554
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we will be back after this.

1420
01:49:33,764 --> 01:49:37,088
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm having trouble locating the Sakura file.

1421
01:49:37,128 --> 01:49:39,751
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I have it somewhere.

1422
01:49:40,531 --> 01:49:41,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't forget you can visit our website.

1423
01:49:41,793 --> 01:49:44,476
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the webcam over at www.orangeonline.com.

1424
01:49:44,496 --> 01:49:49,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, there's not a whole lot interesting on webcam tonight because we don't have quite a full studio as we sometimes do.

1425
01:49:49,641 --> 01:49:53,325
[SPEAKER_04]: But you'll catch one of us dancing in front of it once in a while, so it's definitely worth checking out.

1426
01:49:54,206 --> 01:49:55,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, the chat room, of course.

1427
01:49:56,508 --> 01:50:04,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio and we got the FUs of the week coming up at some point and we might have to do some kind of game tonight.

1428
01:50:05,424 --> 01:50:07,106
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have to do some type of game or something as well.

1429
01:50:07,167 --> 01:50:08,389
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll be back after this.

1430
01:50:53,947 --> 01:50:54,480
Thanks for watching!

1431
01:51:50,242 --> 01:51:51,624
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

1432
01:52:44,852 --> 01:52:45,674
Thanks for watching!

1433
01:53:44,645 --> 01:53:45,487
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

1434
01:57:02,757 --> 01:57:07,645
[SPEAKER_13]: From the Step Squad to Orange Lab, this PDR sucks!

1435
01:57:07,705 --> 01:57:08,226
[SPEAKER_13]: Holla!

1436
01:57:08,246 --> 01:57:08,426
[SPEAKER_13]: P-T-P-O

1437
01:57:16,618 --> 01:57:19,120
[SPEAKER_04]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1438
01:57:19,180 --> 01:57:25,885
[SPEAKER_04]: In that break, you heard a little bit of Sakura, followed by Zenon, R3, and Innocent Walls, both by request from the chat.

1439
01:57:26,185 --> 01:57:29,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, the chat just said, play something Taku, so I picked one we hadn't played in a while.

1440
01:57:29,828 --> 01:57:32,170
[SPEAKER_21]: Taku makes me all flush.

1441
01:57:32,250 --> 01:57:34,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Or as you said in the chat room, Taku is sex.

1442
01:57:34,651 --> 01:57:34,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1443
01:57:34,952 --> 01:57:39,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is funny because then someone said, you know what, Jamie, you always come in here and you just say something is sex, and then you leave.

1444
01:57:41,737 --> 01:57:42,978
[SPEAKER_07]: I am not obsessed.

1445
01:57:44,318 --> 01:57:48,821
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you're not necessarily saying taco sex, but you go in there and you'll be like, gorillas are sex.

1446
01:57:49,062 --> 01:57:51,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, you know, like, Orange Sounds Radio is sex.

1447
01:57:51,984 --> 01:57:54,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, you know, Splenda is sex.

1448
01:57:54,586 --> 01:57:56,727
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what... Splenda is sweet.

1449
01:57:57,107 --> 01:57:57,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Splenda is sweet.

1450
01:57:58,248 --> 01:58:00,110
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, you'll go in there, oh my god, that's sex.

1451
01:58:00,410 --> 01:58:02,071
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like me and that's hot.

1452
01:58:02,632 --> 01:58:04,133
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, you know... That hot.

1453
01:58:04,693 --> 01:58:05,113
[SPEAKER_04]: That's hot.

1454
01:58:05,133 --> 01:58:07,135
[SPEAKER_21]: We need to tell them the story of that hot.

1455
01:58:08,487 --> 01:58:26,412
[SPEAKER_26]: The story of That Hot, there was a gentleman on Phantasy Star Online, well, I'm saying that nicely about him, who would always, he kept trying to say That's Hot, and he's not originally an English speaker, and it was very obvious, so he would refer to everything as That Hot.

1456
01:58:26,973 --> 01:58:29,813
[SPEAKER_26]: And the phrase just kept carrying on and carrying on.

1457
01:58:30,354 --> 01:58:31,714
[SPEAKER_26]: He's a very unique individual.

1458
01:58:32,199 --> 01:58:35,380
[SPEAKER_26]: His name is Guan Li, and he lives somewhere in Minnesota.

1459
01:58:35,720 --> 01:58:38,021
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know exactly where, but I know he's in Minnesota.

1460
01:58:38,081 --> 01:58:38,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Minnesota.

1461
01:58:39,922 --> 01:58:42,803
[SPEAKER_26]: Alrighty, back to... Okay, that hot, that hot.

1462
01:58:44,763 --> 01:58:45,264
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

1463
01:58:45,924 --> 01:58:50,325
[SPEAKER_04]: I might have to start saying that, that hot, ouch, that... Or somebody in the chatroom said, ouch, that hot.

1464
01:58:52,346 --> 01:58:52,926
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

1465
01:58:54,227 --> 01:58:57,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let's find out who won tonight's cage match.

1466
01:58:58,899 --> 01:59:00,841
[SPEAKER_04]: You ready to find out who won the cage match, boys and girls?

1467
01:59:00,881 --> 01:59:01,982
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't care who won.

1468
01:59:02,622 --> 01:59:03,403
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm fabulous.

1469
01:59:03,963 --> 01:59:04,524
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, now tell me.

1470
01:59:04,544 --> 01:59:05,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here it is.

1471
01:59:05,585 --> 01:59:06,906
[SPEAKER_04]: The winner of tonight's cage match.

1472
01:59:09,188 --> 01:59:10,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Three weeks in a row.

1473
01:59:10,569 --> 01:59:11,510
[SPEAKER_13]: Woohoo!

1474
01:59:13,251 --> 01:59:15,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Yoko Kanno with Rise.

1475
01:59:15,353 --> 01:59:16,494
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what that means, boys and girls.

1476
01:59:16,614 --> 01:59:20,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Next week, Yoko Kanno is going for retirement.

1477
01:59:21,479 --> 01:59:27,163
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll only be, if it gets retired next week, it'll be the third track in Orange Lounge history to get retired.

1478
01:59:27,503 --> 01:59:31,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Behind Echo Image with Comeback and Gwen Stefani with What You Waitin' For.

1479
01:59:31,647 --> 01:59:32,988
[SPEAKER_18]: Yoko Kanno is awesome.

1480
01:59:33,028 --> 01:59:39,172
[SPEAKER_04]: How Gwen Stefani made it four weeks with a bunch of top 40 haters, I will never understand, but it really did.

1481
01:59:39,532 --> 01:59:41,654
[SPEAKER_21]: People had no taste and voted for the sellout.

1482
01:59:43,395 --> 01:59:45,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so there it is, Yoko Kanno with Rise.

1483
01:59:46,518 --> 01:59:50,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Next week is the retirement week, so Loki, you and I are going to have to bring out the big guns.

1484
01:59:52,555 --> 01:59:53,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, man, I have to bring girls back.

1485
01:59:55,236 --> 01:59:56,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wait, that sounds like big guns.

1486
01:59:56,737 --> 01:59:57,418
[SPEAKER_18]: Dear God, no.

1487
01:59:57,478 --> 01:59:59,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, so it's all going to come down to me, apparently.

1488
02:00:00,499 --> 02:00:02,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I will have to find the perfect song.

1489
02:00:04,101 --> 02:00:06,962
[SPEAKER_05]: I know something that they'll vote for every time, so I'll bring it.

1490
02:00:08,863 --> 02:00:11,445
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, what echo image do I have that we haven't put in yet?

1491
02:00:11,485 --> 02:00:11,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1492
02:00:12,998 --> 02:00:13,659
[SPEAKER_05]: AYUMI HOMOSAKI

1493
02:00:25,908 --> 02:00:26,308
[SPEAKER_21]: EZ Breezy

1494
02:00:55,968 --> 02:00:56,569
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what?

1495
02:00:56,929 --> 02:00:57,109
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

1496
02:00:57,149 --> 02:01:03,854
[SPEAKER_21]: I need to send you one of her and... Shoot, who was it?

1497
02:01:04,154 --> 02:01:06,136
[SPEAKER_21]: It's some rapper chick.

1498
02:01:06,176 --> 02:01:09,118
[SPEAKER_21]: It was off of the Rush Hour 2 soundtrack.

1499
02:01:10,018 --> 02:01:10,719
[SPEAKER_21]: Blow My Whistle.

1500
02:01:12,156 --> 02:01:14,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, uh, blow my whistle, I don't know who did that.

1501
02:01:14,177 --> 02:01:16,418
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like one of her... Missy Elliot or something, or, I don't know.

1502
02:01:16,818 --> 02:01:19,419
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I don't think so, but it was one of her first English ones.

1503
02:01:19,699 --> 02:01:21,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay, oh, it's a Japanese.

1504
02:01:22,700 --> 02:01:23,100
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1505
02:01:23,821 --> 02:01:24,461
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you just said it.

1506
02:01:24,501 --> 02:01:25,601
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, it's Itada Hikaru.

1507
02:01:26,082 --> 02:01:26,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh!

1508
02:01:26,942 --> 02:01:27,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I didn't know it was her.

1509
02:01:28,002 --> 02:01:28,723
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I'll find it.

1510
02:01:28,943 --> 02:01:31,644
[SPEAKER_21]: It's one of her early all-English ones.

1511
02:01:31,984 --> 02:01:33,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'll have to find it.

1512
02:01:34,005 --> 02:01:34,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1513
02:01:36,426 --> 02:01:36,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1514
02:01:37,580 --> 02:01:43,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on, I thought we could get into the DDR Freak Post of the Week.

1515
02:01:45,421 --> 02:01:46,201
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate your loyalty.

1516
02:02:12,057 --> 02:02:15,538
[SPEAKER_04]: You can catch it the week after on DDR Freak.

1517
02:02:15,558 --> 02:02:20,339
[SPEAKER_04]: When I say the week after, I mean this Friday's show will actually be last Sunday's show.

1518
02:02:20,379 --> 02:02:22,379
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like a week gap.

1519
02:02:22,519 --> 02:02:24,080
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why it is that way, but it just is.

1520
02:02:24,400 --> 02:02:27,341
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's to give us a little bit of a buffer should we miss a week or something.

1521
02:02:27,401 --> 02:02:29,641
[SPEAKER_04]: It's to save our butt a little bit, so we'll see.

1522
02:02:30,321 --> 02:02:33,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, let's get into the DDR Freak post of the week.

1523
02:02:37,911 --> 02:02:43,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a tie for the DDR Freak Post of the Week this week, because there's two really, really good ones.

1524
02:02:43,896 --> 02:02:45,377
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to start off with this one.

1525
02:02:45,417 --> 02:02:52,942
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a thread, and it was created in DDR Chit Chat, which is the home of great DDR Freak Posts of the Week.

1526
02:02:53,002 --> 02:02:53,943
[SPEAKER_04]: We love our spam.

1527
02:02:55,344 --> 02:03:02,550
[SPEAKER_04]: This post was by a BASIC member, and the subject is New Religion, Anti-DDR Forever.

1528
02:03:03,868 --> 02:03:10,193
[SPEAKER_04]: And the post reads, join my friends, new religion, anti-DDR forever.

1529
02:03:10,813 --> 02:03:14,696
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Christian based, but it says that DDR is a sin.

1530
02:03:15,216 --> 02:03:18,298
[SPEAKER_04]: He has added an extra commandment, no DDR.

1531
02:03:18,359 --> 02:03:23,102
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, commandment was spelled without a D. So he added an extra commandment, no DDR.

1532
02:03:29,264 --> 02:03:30,005
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the post.

1533
02:03:30,505 --> 02:03:31,786
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Christian-based!

1534
02:03:33,127 --> 02:03:35,128
[SPEAKER_04]: But they've added an extra commandment.

1535
02:03:37,409 --> 02:03:42,733
[SPEAKER_05]: They should meet... Rob, that earns a yay.

1536
02:03:42,773 --> 02:03:43,673
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a demo bass.

1537
02:03:44,094 --> 02:03:45,234
[SPEAKER_18]: He's a demo mouse.

1538
02:03:45,775 --> 02:03:47,116
[SPEAKER_12]: No, but this is the funny thing.

1539
02:03:47,156 --> 02:03:49,857
[SPEAKER_12]: This is what makes the post more hilarious than anything.

1540
02:03:50,738 --> 02:03:53,980
[SPEAKER_12]: Is the signature says... This is the guy's signature.

1541
02:03:55,121 --> 02:03:56,762
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm single and it sucks.

1542
02:03:58,528 --> 02:04:00,409
[SPEAKER_12]: I wonder why!

1543
02:04:00,429 --> 02:04:03,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Who didn't think that?

1544
02:04:03,952 --> 02:04:09,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, seriously, I would like to know, was there anybody in the chatroom when I said, I'm single and it sucks, is this guy's signature?

1545
02:04:09,958 --> 02:04:14,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anybody in the chatroom, anybody out there listening that didn't think, I wonder why?

1546
02:04:15,282 --> 02:04:15,943
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to know.

1547
02:04:17,124 --> 02:04:20,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably the third post down.

1548
02:04:20,807 --> 02:04:22,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, the third post down, oh yes.

1549
02:04:22,448 --> 02:04:22,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Four is amazing.

1550
02:04:24,388 --> 02:04:28,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody above it said, WTF, you're either a complete idiot or just a terrible troll.

1551
02:04:28,610 --> 02:04:29,411
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm guessing the latter.

1552
02:04:29,771 --> 02:04:31,592
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the next person said, I'm guessing both.

1553
02:04:33,053 --> 02:04:33,794
[SPEAKER_04]: And then this is great.

1554
02:04:34,194 --> 02:04:40,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody else jumps in there and says, Ah, and using the Lord's name in vain like you did in one of your other posts is not a sin?

1555
02:04:41,599 --> 02:04:42,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, snap.

1556
02:04:44,021 --> 02:04:45,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody totally served that guy.

1557
02:04:45,482 --> 02:04:47,743
[SPEAKER_21]: I need this thread, though, because I have to look at something on it.

1558
02:04:48,204 --> 02:04:49,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, it was locked.

1559
02:04:50,025 --> 02:04:50,045
[SPEAKER_21]: I...

1560
02:04:51,929 --> 02:04:55,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

1561
02:04:55,111 --> 02:04:57,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want me to link the whole chatroom to that, or just you?

1562
02:04:57,773 --> 02:04:59,054
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, link the chatroom to that.

1563
02:04:59,395 --> 02:04:59,915
[SPEAKER_21]: There you go.

1564
02:04:59,935 --> 02:05:01,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Have fun with that, you guys, although the post is locked.

1565
02:05:02,016 --> 02:05:03,297
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't follow up on that anymore.

1566
02:05:04,738 --> 02:05:05,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1567
02:05:06,360 --> 02:05:06,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1568
02:05:06,820 --> 02:05:11,604
[SPEAKER_04]: One other post, because one DDR Freak post of the week is just not enough.

1569
02:05:11,624 --> 02:05:13,885
[SPEAKER_04]: There were too many good posts this week, so we have another one here.

1570
02:05:14,786 --> 02:05:14,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1571
02:05:16,630 --> 02:05:36,617
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's actually not a brand new topic but it was posted in an existing thread and it's in the red octane ignition version 2.0 thread and this is post number 182 and this is what's great is that you get to see what happens when DDR Freak filters take over here's the post

1572
02:05:38,197 --> 02:05:43,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like after Frick two weeks of use, this pad is already starting to give out.

1573
02:05:43,425 --> 02:05:46,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Here come the Frick random goods on 7-footers.

1574
02:05:46,389 --> 02:05:50,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Frick worthless piece of $100 garbage poopy buttocks Frick.

1575
02:05:50,982 --> 02:06:02,547
[SPEAKER_04]: After a frustrating B-score on A-heavy, I threw the Frick pad on the floor and punched the living Frick out of it, and then I grabbed the cord and smacked it on across my wall, breaking the Xbox piece off.

1576
02:06:02,888 --> 02:06:09,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Frick, piece of garbage poopy, don't Frick buy this red-ock tank and Frick suck my penis, then vomit and eat that too.

1577
02:06:17,821 --> 02:06:18,821
[SPEAKER_21]: I love the filters.

1578
02:06:18,941 --> 02:06:20,941
[SPEAKER_21]: I really do love the filters on DDR Freak.

1579
02:06:21,061 --> 02:06:24,822
[SPEAKER_04]: That, you know, that makes the whole post right there.

1580
02:06:24,942 --> 02:06:29,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't frick buy this red octane, can frick suck my penis and vomit and eat that too.

1581
02:06:31,643 --> 02:06:35,684
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like a really bad version of DDR Mad Libs or something.

1582
02:06:36,464 --> 02:06:39,365
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh man, go the filters, that's funny.

1583
02:06:41,758 --> 02:06:45,339
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't stand for censorship in the chat room.

1584
02:06:57,125 --> 02:06:57,445
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1585
02:06:59,287 --> 02:07:04,250
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have a suggestion for DDR Freak Post of the Week, you can always send me a private message on DDR Freak.

1586
02:07:04,290 --> 02:07:05,912
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Sky, S-K-I-E.

1587
02:07:06,252 --> 02:07:07,673
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, some folks have done that.

1588
02:07:07,713 --> 02:07:11,536
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually had, I think last week or two weeks ago, was a user-submitted Post of the Week.

1589
02:07:11,936 --> 02:07:12,677
[SPEAKER_04]: So send those over.

1590
02:07:12,937 --> 02:07:13,878
[SPEAKER_04]: But please remember...

1591
02:07:14,598 --> 02:07:21,504
[SPEAKER_04]: If you see mental retardation going on on DDR Freak, and it's not somebody who is actually mentally retarded, because that would be okay.

1592
02:07:21,584 --> 02:07:23,746
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay if somebody actually is mentally retarded.

1593
02:07:24,146 --> 02:07:28,710
[SPEAKER_04]: But if somebody is acting mentally retarded, you need to PM a moderator so they can lock the thread.

1594
02:07:29,030 --> 02:07:29,310
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1595
02:07:30,291 --> 02:07:31,612
[SPEAKER_21]: Look, you know one.

1596
02:07:31,732 --> 02:07:32,232
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi.

1597
02:07:32,493 --> 02:07:33,654
[SPEAKER_21]: Send me a private message.

1598
02:07:33,714 --> 02:07:36,416
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll make sure you're taken care of.

1599
02:07:37,451 --> 02:07:37,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1600
02:07:37,992 --> 02:07:43,016
[SPEAKER_04]: They wanted a link to that post as well with the Frick Eat My Vomit 2 one.

1601
02:07:44,077 --> 02:07:44,817
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll find it, guys.

1602
02:07:44,877 --> 02:07:45,858
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll post it in chat.

1603
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:48,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I found it.

1604
02:07:48,500 --> 02:07:48,781
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.

1605
02:07:49,061 --> 02:07:52,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, guys, it's post 182 in the thread.

1606
02:07:52,283 --> 02:07:53,364
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very large thread.

1607
02:07:53,785 --> 02:07:54,945
[SPEAKER_04]: So have fun with that.

1608
02:07:55,606 --> 02:07:55,886
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1609
02:07:59,789 --> 02:08:02,672
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there is a way you can get around those filters if you're smart.

1610
02:08:03,280 --> 02:08:04,200
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, but we're not going to tell you.

1611
02:08:04,220 --> 02:08:07,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm not going to tell you, but it's not that hard to figure out, just, you know.

1612
02:08:08,501 --> 02:08:10,381
[SPEAKER_04]: You just have to be bold about doing it, that's all.

1613
02:08:13,082 --> 02:08:14,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Wah, wah, wah!

1614
02:08:14,262 --> 02:08:14,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyway.

1615
02:08:20,183 --> 02:08:21,824
[SPEAKER_04]: What, it wasn't funny when I read it?

1616
02:08:21,924 --> 02:08:24,564
[SPEAKER_21]: No, but it made me laugh again the second time.

1617
02:08:24,604 --> 02:08:28,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Because of all the caps and stuff, like it goes from caps to lower the caps, it's just funny.

1618
02:08:29,523 --> 02:08:33,887
[SPEAKER_21]: and I quote, Poopy Buttocks Frick.

1619
02:08:36,489 --> 02:08:36,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1620
02:08:41,634 --> 02:08:44,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, what else are we going to get into here news-wise?

1621
02:08:45,277 --> 02:08:48,780
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought there was some other news that needed some talking about here this week.

1622
02:08:50,922 --> 02:08:52,323
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something going on.

1623
02:08:53,806 --> 02:09:05,929
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we've got our podcast that goes on, and you can download that from our website, www.orangelandtrader.com, and click on To Go, and that's where you can figure out what's going on with the rest of the gaming world.

1624
02:09:06,269 --> 02:09:16,032
[SPEAKER_04]: We've kind of started to expand to talk a little bit more about the general gaming world here on this program, but, you know, we talk a lot about other stuff on the other program.

1625
02:09:16,852 --> 02:09:23,016
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, somebody was asking in the chat room earlier, what happened with DDR featuring Mario?

1626
02:09:23,937 --> 02:09:28,500
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was a good question because we haven't heard a whole lot about DDR featuring Mario lately.

1627
02:09:28,880 --> 02:09:35,025
[SPEAKER_04]: So I kind of decided, hey, as long as I'm on DDR Freak making fun of people, maybe I'll go and actually get a useful thread.

1628
02:09:35,705 --> 02:09:35,845
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

1629
02:09:37,415 --> 02:09:43,420
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to check out what's going on on the DDR GameCube thread, and there's really not a whole lot going on right now.

1630
02:09:44,341 --> 02:09:52,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently there might be screenshots in GMR magazine, but there's nothing really super official that has been announced yet.

1631
02:09:54,529 --> 02:10:04,077
[SPEAKER_04]: And then rumor is that screenshots for the pad have come out recently, but nothing super duper official that we haven't already seen as of yet.

1632
02:10:06,259 --> 02:10:08,461
[SPEAKER_04]: That answers the DDR Featuring Mario question as well.

1633
02:10:11,403 --> 02:10:14,165
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess what we're going to do now is we're going to go ahead and get a little bit angsty.

1634
02:10:14,626 --> 02:10:27,677
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you guys want to go ahead and submit some FUs of the week to my private inbox there in the chatroom, just send me a private message, we will start to get angsty with a little segment we call the FUs of the week.

1635
02:10:27,757 --> 02:10:31,921
[SPEAKER_04]: And Jamie, why is it that we have to do the FUs of the week every single freaking week?

1636
02:10:33,066 --> 02:10:34,507
[SPEAKER_14]: Because the world sucks!

1637
02:10:34,527 --> 02:10:35,829
[SPEAKER_14]: This world is bullshit!

1638
02:10:40,774 --> 02:10:42,956
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, this is bad.

1639
02:10:43,016 --> 02:10:44,658
[SPEAKER_28]: Here is justice.

1640
02:10:44,698 --> 02:10:46,139
[SPEAKER_28]: Here is punishment.

1641
02:10:46,319 --> 02:10:49,442
[SPEAKER_11]: Here is... This is fucked up!

1642
02:10:51,044 --> 02:10:55,568
[SPEAKER_21]: I F you to my busy, busy, busy, busy, busy... Did I say busy?

1643
02:10:55,628 --> 02:10:56,229
[SPEAKER_21]: Schedule.

1644
02:10:56,629 --> 02:10:56,950
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay?

1645
02:10:58,448 --> 02:11:00,329
[SPEAKER_21]: I work all the damn time.

1646
02:11:00,549 --> 02:11:06,813
[SPEAKER_21]: I go to the gym, I go to school, and then by the time I get home, I'm too damn tired to do anything else.

1647
02:11:07,433 --> 02:11:12,436
[SPEAKER_21]: Except work on, you know, whatever projects I happen to have going on.

1648
02:11:13,277 --> 02:11:22,022
[SPEAKER_21]: Big F you to putting a lot of hard work into something and then not having it recognized.

1649
02:11:22,990 --> 02:11:27,814
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's happened several times over the past week, so I've been kind of, eh.

1650
02:11:27,834 --> 02:11:36,803
[SPEAKER_21]: F you to my driver's side window for randomly becoming detached from the mechanism that holds it up and rolling itself down.

1651
02:11:37,103 --> 02:11:39,745
[SPEAKER_21]: Creating a loud whistling noise not unlike that heard in a hurricane.

1652
02:11:40,226 --> 02:11:40,926
[SPEAKER_21]: Really aggravating.

1653
02:11:40,946 --> 02:11:49,294
[SPEAKER_21]: When I'm trying to listen to my good music really, really loud in my little, you know, 93 Tercel, my speakers are bad enough as it is.

1654
02:11:51,558 --> 02:11:55,980
[SPEAKER_21]: F you to the person who was going 10 miles under the speed limit when I'm trying to go 20 over.

1655
02:11:56,000 --> 02:12:00,741
[SPEAKER_21]: I hope that no CHP people are listening to that.

1656
02:12:01,501 --> 02:12:05,783
[SPEAKER_21]: And a big F you to myself for not being able to decide on what my next hair color should be.

1657
02:12:06,023 --> 02:12:07,423
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe I should leave that to the chat room.

1658
02:12:09,244 --> 02:12:13,425
[SPEAKER_21]: Find me a haircut and find me a hair color because I'm getting damn tired of what I have now.

1659
02:12:14,985 --> 02:12:16,706
[SPEAKER_21]: And a big F you toward...

1660
02:12:19,173 --> 02:12:22,414
[SPEAKER_21]: Having people not recognize how much of a fabulous celebrity I am.

1661
02:12:23,414 --> 02:12:23,755
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm done.

1662
02:12:24,455 --> 02:12:25,195
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks.

1663
02:12:26,776 --> 02:12:27,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, it's all you.

1664
02:12:30,797 --> 02:12:35,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, first off, fuck you to goddamn me hitting a car.

1665
02:12:35,939 --> 02:12:37,179
[SPEAKER_05]: That fucking sucked.

1666
02:12:38,259 --> 02:12:43,461
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, that just totally put a big, huge roadblock in my perfect weekend.

1667
02:12:44,161 --> 02:12:45,401
[SPEAKER_05]: So, fuck you to that.

1668
02:12:46,722 --> 02:12:55,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, fuck the fact that Mitch Hedberg had to die because he was touring with Stephen Lynch and that would have been an awesome show to see.

1669
02:12:55,725 --> 02:12:57,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I just have to settle for Stephen Lynch.

1670
02:12:57,746 --> 02:12:58,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh well.

1671
02:13:00,667 --> 02:13:07,069
[SPEAKER_05]: And fuck you to the Pope for not dying fast enough for me to make a joke about him on April Fool's Day.

1672
02:13:07,577 --> 02:13:10,798
[SPEAKER_05]: God damn it, you know, he was just clinging to life and he just needed to die.

1673
02:13:11,279 --> 02:13:12,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Just die quick.

1674
02:13:12,339 --> 02:13:13,179
[SPEAKER_05]: We knew he was going.

1675
02:13:13,199 --> 02:13:14,460
[SPEAKER_05]: They already read him his last rites.

1676
02:13:14,520 --> 02:13:17,201
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of like, okay, yep, we're just waiting for him to stop breathing.

1677
02:13:17,361 --> 02:13:17,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1678
02:13:18,522 --> 02:13:19,742
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they weren't even trying.

1679
02:13:19,802 --> 02:13:21,223
[SPEAKER_05]: He was just like, you know, dying.

1680
02:13:21,763 --> 02:13:23,044
[SPEAKER_05]: So, to hell with him.

1681
02:13:23,244 --> 02:13:23,604
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um...

1682
02:13:24,704 --> 02:13:27,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, um, I know I had some other ones.

1683
02:13:27,807 --> 02:13:34,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, once again, fuck you to me for hitting that car, um, only because the car was an SUV being driven by women.

1684
02:13:34,351 --> 02:13:38,834
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know how I say women drivers, women who drive SUVs fucking suck.

1685
02:13:39,715 --> 02:13:44,638
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a big, you know, bit of irony for me, so, um, oh well.

1686
02:13:45,539 --> 02:13:53,244
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I live, last accident I've been in was like seven years ago anyway, so, and this is like, not even, doesn't even really even qualify as an accident, so it's,

1687
02:13:53,484 --> 02:13:54,985
[SPEAKER_05]: All things just keep getting better

1688
02:14:19,183 --> 02:14:25,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, F you to the fact that there's been so much death in the media lately, like between that chicken Florida and the Pope.

1689
02:14:26,070 --> 02:14:27,711
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sick of hearing about people dying.

1690
02:14:28,252 --> 02:14:30,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hear about something happy once in a while.

1691
02:14:30,634 --> 02:14:33,296
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to hear about Disneyland getting a new ride or something.

1692
02:14:34,017 --> 02:14:38,521
[SPEAKER_04]: So, just, God, find something happy to report on once in a while, you guys.

1693
02:14:38,701 --> 02:14:39,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Dang.

1694
02:14:40,123 --> 02:14:40,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1695
02:14:41,855 --> 02:14:49,617
[SPEAKER_04]: An F you to PSPs for costing so much money.

1696
02:14:50,298 --> 02:14:52,498
[SPEAKER_04]: An F you to work drama I had on Friday.

1697
02:14:52,518 --> 02:14:53,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing terrible.

1698
02:14:54,139 --> 02:14:56,259
[SPEAKER_04]: I was an angsty little man on Friday.

1699
02:14:56,599 --> 02:15:03,021
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't participate in April Fool's Day as much as I wanted to because of things that were going on on Friday.

1700
02:15:03,582 --> 02:15:05,782
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate it when things put me in a bad mood like that.

1701
02:15:09,104 --> 02:15:16,009
[SPEAKER_04]: and then F you to the fact that I think my car needs repairs because I don't like having to pay for that stuff.

1702
02:15:16,289 --> 02:15:16,810
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1703
02:15:17,010 --> 02:15:17,991
[SPEAKER_04]: That's alright, it's not your fault.

1704
02:15:18,051 --> 02:15:19,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you were the one that broke my car, then it is your fault.

1705
02:15:20,913 --> 02:15:21,634
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I didn't.

1706
02:15:21,894 --> 02:15:22,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's good.

1707
02:15:23,695 --> 02:15:28,959
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also F you, lastly, F you to the House of Wax for having Paris Hilton in it.

1708
02:15:29,139 --> 02:15:29,680
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not hot.

1709
02:15:31,206 --> 02:15:31,986
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, what if she dies?

1710
02:15:32,487 --> 02:15:39,990
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, and that's what I was saying, since she doesn't have top billing, she's likely to be an extra character that gets offed in the movie, so that would be worth seeing.

1711
02:15:40,491 --> 02:15:44,733
[SPEAKER_05]: And notice in the trailer, the first thing that they show her is making a sex tape.

1712
02:15:45,513 --> 02:15:46,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, but I'm sure that's supposed to be funny!

1713
02:15:47,234 --> 02:15:48,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope, sorry.

1714
02:15:50,115 --> 02:15:50,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Comedy.

1715
02:15:51,956 --> 02:15:57,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the rest of the room here and get their FUs, starting off with DDR Angel, and then over to Julie.

1716
02:15:59,608 --> 02:16:09,729
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been to myself not finding the change of Kalathia disc sooner because, uh, yeah, I, I, uh, inadvertently jinxed Sky over here to, uh...

1717
02:16:10,532 --> 02:16:13,374
[SPEAKER_19]: Let Me Borrow His, but then he couldn't find his either, so that was kind of weird.

1718
02:16:14,715 --> 02:16:16,757
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, yeah, so I found him, whatever.

1719
02:16:17,257 --> 02:16:28,626
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I viewed that class getting canceled on Tuesday because I really wanted that one to work out, but hey, I guess rules are rules, and I showed up, but nobody else did, so that's kind of sad.

1720
02:16:30,647 --> 02:16:31,148
[SPEAKER_19]: And, let's see.

1721
02:16:33,101 --> 02:16:40,144
[SPEAKER_19]: F you to the stupid person who on the way here tried to cut me off and made me go all the way around.

1722
02:16:50,337 --> 02:16:52,218
[SPEAKER_26]: FU to my schedule, I agree with that.

1723
02:16:52,659 --> 02:16:55,120
[SPEAKER_26]: And FU, I agree with all the people dying.

1724
02:16:55,140 --> 02:16:58,381
[SPEAKER_26]: There was a poke out on the anniversary of my cat's death, which was kind of interesting.

1725
02:16:59,462 --> 02:17:03,544
[SPEAKER_26]: And, by the way, at Disneyland, there is something happy going on on May 5th.

1726
02:17:03,564 --> 02:17:05,485
[SPEAKER_26]: They're doing their big anniversary celebration.

1727
02:17:05,525 --> 02:17:06,485
[SPEAKER_26]: That needs to be in the news.

1728
02:17:06,525 --> 02:17:07,726
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm sick of all the death, too.

1729
02:17:07,866 --> 02:17:08,466
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.

1730
02:17:08,566 --> 02:17:12,088
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I want to hear about happy children partying at Disneyland.

1731
02:17:12,928 --> 02:17:14,749
[SPEAKER_04]: And then getting blown away with bombs.

1732
02:17:14,809 --> 02:17:15,289
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm kidding.

1733
02:17:15,509 --> 02:17:15,869
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kidding.

1734
02:17:15,909 --> 02:17:16,770
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not that sadistic.

1735
02:17:18,858 --> 02:17:20,999
[SPEAKER_26]: All righty, and I guess that's the end of my FU for today.

1736
02:17:21,279 --> 02:17:21,619
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1737
02:17:24,080 --> 02:17:25,621
[SPEAKER_04]: I do like what the chat room is saying, though.

1738
02:17:25,661 --> 02:17:29,743
[SPEAKER_04]: They're suggesting that there be a Kingdom Hearts ride added at Disneyland.

1739
02:17:29,763 --> 02:17:30,983
[SPEAKER_21]: That would be hot.

1740
02:17:32,044 --> 02:17:32,684
That hot.

1741
02:17:33,865 --> 02:17:34,425
[SPEAKER_04]: That hot.

02:17:34,765 --> 02:17:35,145
[SPEAKER_04]: That hot.

1743
02:17:37,133 --> 02:17:41,177
[SPEAKER_21]: Great, you can tell Guan that he's infected Orange Lounge Radio now.

02:17:41,677 --> 02:17:42,578
[SPEAKER_21]: I will let Guan know.

1745
02:17:42,598 --> 02:17:45,320

[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1763
02:18:52,819 --> 02:18:59,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Lxldubes says, I need to send an FU to Resident Evil 4 for making me kill Spanish-speaking monsters.

[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and here's me plugging www.cynictaxi.co.nr.

1769
02:19:22,752 --> 02:19:24,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Cynical articles and general wackiness.

1770
02:19:25,514 --> 02:19:27,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Just search for Robot Chicken Torrents.

1771
02:19:27,355 --> 02:19:29,857
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not on TorrentBox, but I found it, so it's out there.

02:19:46,792 --> 02:19:47,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe it.

1775
02:19:47,632 --> 02:19:52,516
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm at 773.17 gigabytes and I've used almost all of it up again.

1776
02:19:55,258 --> 02:19:59,741
[SPEAKER_04]: I just bought that 400 gig hard drive in January.

1777
02:20:00,161 --> 02:20:02,203
[SPEAKER_04]: I really need cheap terabyte drives.

1781
02:20:13,009 --> 02:20:14,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and F you to daylight savings time.

1782
02:20:14,950 --> 02:20:15,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Why does this exist?

1783
02:20:16,610 --> 02:20:17,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1784
02:20:17,371 --> 02:20:17,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.

1785
02:20:17,971 --> 02:20:19,371
[SPEAKER_04]: I completely forgot.

1786
02:20:19,772 --> 02:20:23,133
[SPEAKER_04]: A giant F you to daylight savings time.

1787
02:20:23,153 --> 02:20:26,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Because of daylight savings time, I didn't get to bed until 6 in the morning today.

1788
02:20:27,475 --> 02:20:28,035
[SPEAKER_04]: That's bad.

1789
02:20:29,451 --> 02:20:30,672
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, five in the morning is pretty bad.

1790
02:20:30,692 --> 02:20:31,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Six in the morning, really bad.

1791
02:20:31,992 --> 02:20:35,054
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, just F you to daylight savings time.

1792
02:20:35,434 --> 02:20:35,874
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate you.

1793
02:20:36,154 --> 02:20:36,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Please die.

1794
02:20:36,875 --> 02:20:38,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do we have daylight savings time?

1795
02:20:38,155 --> 02:20:39,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody told me it's a farmer's thing.

1796
02:20:39,936 --> 02:20:44,158
[SPEAKER_04]: That they did it so that farmers could get up at a reasonable hour and tend to the crops.

1797
02:20:45,119 --> 02:20:45,559
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1798
02:20:46,519 --> 02:20:46,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Julie?

1799
02:20:47,340 --> 02:20:52,362
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, it was due because there was some votes and actually there's some areas in the United States that don't actually observe it.

1800
02:20:53,303 --> 02:20:58,145
[SPEAKER_26]: It's because they were mad that parents were having their kids walk to school while it was dark.

1801
02:20:58,769 --> 02:21:00,711
[SPEAKER_26]: The farm thing I'm not doubting is true as well.

1802
02:21:00,991 --> 02:21:02,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Get the kid a flashlight.

1803
02:21:02,593 --> 02:21:03,093
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

1804
02:21:03,153 --> 02:21:03,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Get the kid a gun.

1805
02:21:03,834 --> 02:21:04,735
[SPEAKER_26]: I totally agree with that.

1806
02:21:04,875 --> 02:21:08,418
[SPEAKER_21]: I dig daylight savings time, though, because then I get to drive to work in the dark again.

1807
02:21:09,580 --> 02:21:10,160
[SPEAKER_04]: It weirds me out.

1808
02:21:10,180 --> 02:21:12,422
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I get to drive to work at 6 a.m.

1809
02:21:12,462 --> 02:21:13,003
[SPEAKER_21]: in the morning.

1810
02:21:13,443 --> 02:21:15,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Who lets their kids walk to school anyways?

1811
02:21:16,887 --> 02:21:23,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, I mean, buses pick up any kids that are, like, one mile, you know, further away, I mean.

1812
02:21:24,542 --> 02:21:25,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Who gives a shit?

1813
02:21:25,502 --> 02:21:28,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Most people don't walk anyways, and the people that do walk, oh no.

1814
02:21:28,803 --> 02:21:32,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because you know all those muggers out there that want to steal their kids' lunch money.

1815
02:21:32,765 --> 02:21:33,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo!

1816
02:21:33,925 --> 02:21:41,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, and in this part of town where I'm from, like, you know, all the 16-year-olds have SUVs anyway, and they're all driving to school, so, whatever.

1817
02:21:41,288 --> 02:21:41,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, sorry.

1818
02:21:41,948 --> 02:21:42,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get back to the FUs.

1819
02:21:45,029 --> 02:21:50,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Ranma says, fuck you to the city of Boston for not having beer.

1820
02:21:51,389 --> 02:21:55,692
[SPEAKER_04]: ARG, we had to travel out in the suburbs for it, and the liquor stores close at 9.

1821
02:21:56,612 --> 02:21:58,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck this nonsensical Puritan bullshit.

1822
02:21:58,873 --> 02:21:59,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck Boston.

1823
02:22:00,054 --> 02:22:01,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, fuck Red Sox, go Yanks.

1824
02:22:02,015 --> 02:22:03,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh god, he's gonna start that on this show.

1825
02:22:04,717 --> 02:22:07,859
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100Matt says, F you to DVD Studio Pro.

1826
02:22:08,199 --> 02:22:12,281
[SPEAKER_04]: The programs keep crashing in my class, thus taking forever to finish my final project.

1827
02:22:12,942 --> 02:22:18,445
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to me for taking forever to get out of the 7 and 8 step range in DDR.

1828
02:22:18,465 --> 02:22:20,286
[SPEAKER_04]: 3 to 5 months and counting.

1829
02:22:21,949 --> 02:22:25,732
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to the Farley Brothers and Jimmy Fallon for making the Boston Red Sox movie.

1830
02:22:27,873 --> 02:22:31,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Ninst says, FU to the place I ordered my PS2 flip-top from.

1831
02:22:32,216 --> 02:22:34,738
[SPEAKER_04]: It's two weeks late and I can't get a hold of anyone from the company.

1832
02:22:35,098 --> 02:22:36,439
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to play 2DX already.

1833
02:22:36,519 --> 02:22:37,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy the disputed charge.

1834
02:22:38,960 --> 02:22:40,582
[SPEAKER_04]: FU two of the guys I work with.

1835
02:22:40,602 --> 02:22:42,743
[SPEAKER_04]: They are complete idiots and they never shut the hell up.

1836
02:22:42,943 --> 02:22:43,924
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to Snow in April.

1837
02:22:45,543 --> 02:22:54,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Knight says, my FU goes to the screw up my job did when I got paid this weekend instead of taking 40 bucks out of my check to help me pay my taxes off from 01.

1838
02:22:55,630 --> 02:23:00,053
[SPEAKER_04]: They took the whole amount that I owe, which leaves me with nothing for two whole weeks.

1839
02:23:00,973 --> 02:23:06,477
[SPEAKER_04]: An FU to employees who don't know when to keep their hands to themselves, especially when they try to steal from the store.

1840
02:23:07,258 --> 02:23:07,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Genius.

1841
02:23:09,119 --> 02:23:18,946
[SPEAKER_04]: RPGKing7 says, my two FUs of the week are FU to not being able to get some alone time with my girlfriend and FU to missing my best friend of seven years who left for the Canadian Navy.

1842
02:23:19,466 --> 02:23:23,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and fuck you to the end of the Beck Mongolian Chop Squad anime.

1843
02:23:24,050 --> 02:23:25,190
[SPEAKER_04]: It should go on forever.

1844
02:23:25,751 --> 02:23:31,215
[SPEAKER_04]: And lastly, Flerone, FU to Dizzy from Guilty Gear XX not having an insta-kill.

[SPEAKER_04]: The end.

1854
02:24:26,184 --> 02:24:29,807
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really want to say the convention, like sales conference type thing that's in Texas.

1855
02:24:30,727 --> 02:24:35,270
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're bringing DDR and Kuroki Revolution to play.

1856
02:24:35,711 --> 02:24:37,972
[SPEAKER_05]: So they want to try it out here to see what it is.

02:30:02,624 --> 02:30:06,186
[SPEAKER_13]: I know you'll get to like it if you give it a try.

1875
02:30:27,052 --> 02:30:28,873
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

1876
02:31:07,736 --> 02:31:22,061
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.

1877
02:31:22,402 --> 02:31:27,283
[SPEAKER_22]: And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.

1878
02:31:28,164 --> 02:31:34,106
[SPEAKER_24]: Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

1879
02:31:34,477 --> 02:31:41,861
[SPEAKER_24]: It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free

1880
02:32:04,685 --> 02:32:06,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into some Ask Orange Lounge.

1881
02:32:06,626 --> 02:32:12,688
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got some time to fill here tonight, so we're going to get into this.

1882
02:32:12,708 --> 02:32:17,710
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we might try to do a little bit of news, too, if we kind of run out of questions.

1883
02:32:17,750 --> 02:32:20,791
[SPEAKER_04]: But it looks like a lot of you guys have some questions you've got to know the answer to.

1884
02:32:22,111 --> 02:32:22,952
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll get into that.

1885
02:32:29,318 --> 02:32:34,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's Ask Orange Lounge, Some Stupid Question, What Will We Find Out This Week?

1886
02:32:34,400 --> 02:32:41,503
[SPEAKER_04]: On Orange Lounge Radio, you can tell that we need to fill a little time, 30 minutes to be exact.

1887
02:32:41,523 --> 02:32:43,344
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope this segment is long tonight.

1888
02:32:45,485 --> 02:32:47,006
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a slow news week, what can we say?

1889
02:32:50,767 --> 02:32:52,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Illusion says question.

1890
02:32:53,652 --> 02:32:55,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Here is a question for Sky.

1891
02:32:55,474 --> 02:32:57,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh God, I should have known this subject would come up tonight.

1892
02:32:58,637 --> 02:33:02,800
[SPEAKER_04]: How could you not absolutely love Sin City with a passion?

1893
02:33:02,880 --> 02:33:10,427
[SPEAKER_04]: He's referencing a live journal post I made earlier this week that said simply, Sin City, all style, little substance.

1894
02:33:11,548 --> 02:33:15,131
[SPEAKER_04]: First, to give the point tonight, we'll do a little point counterpoint.

1895
02:33:15,512 --> 02:33:17,293
[SPEAKER_04]: I will let Loki gush about Sin City.

1896
02:33:20,016 --> 02:33:20,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Um.

1897
02:33:20,714 --> 02:33:26,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Since it was awesome, I mean, first of all, it's very, um, stylistic.

1898
02:33:27,058 --> 02:33:31,661
[SPEAKER_05]: It did have substance, it had much substance, very, very much substance.

1899
02:33:31,681 --> 02:33:36,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, um, it was basically the best adaptation of a comic book that's ever been made.

1900
02:33:36,444 --> 02:33:39,526
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually didn't even make a screenplay for it, it was done straight from the comic book.

1901
02:33:40,306 --> 02:33:43,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I loved it, actually, um...

1902
02:33:43,939 --> 02:33:48,762
[SPEAKER_05]: My favorite parts were those of, I believe it was, the big fat kill was pretty good.

1903
02:33:49,102 --> 02:33:51,903
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked that with all the whores with guns.

1904
02:33:52,224 --> 02:33:52,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotta love that.

1905
02:33:54,685 --> 02:33:57,787
[SPEAKER_05]: I especially loved, I believe her name was Miho or something like that.

1906
02:33:58,247 --> 02:33:59,107
[SPEAKER_05]: She was badass.

1907
02:33:59,187 --> 02:34:04,550
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's something that Jamie would like because, I mean, totally Battle Royale-ish.

1908
02:34:04,730 --> 02:34:05,971
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very awesome.

1909
02:34:06,071 --> 02:34:08,613
[SPEAKER_05]: You would just be like, this chick kicks ass.

1910
02:34:08,813 --> 02:34:09,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1911
02:34:09,073 --> 02:34:11,114
[SPEAKER_05]: I would recommend Jamie.

1912
02:34:13,188 --> 02:34:14,910
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1913
02:34:32,509 --> 02:34:33,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Frodo eating the other hobbits

1914
02:35:00,845 --> 02:35:05,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Frodo plus Harry Potter equals scare, seriously, because you look like Harry Potter.

1915
02:35:06,141 --> 02:35:08,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Harry Potter and Spider-Man crossed.

1916
02:35:09,384 --> 02:35:11,266
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, throw in a little bit of cannibalism.

1917
02:35:11,486 --> 02:35:13,668
[SPEAKER_05]: That would pretty much what you'd have Elijah Wood's character.

1918
02:35:15,529 --> 02:35:19,393
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, Bruce Willis stuff is pretty good, too.

1919
02:35:20,474 --> 02:35:22,836
[SPEAKER_05]: It's ultra-violent, very gruesome.

1920
02:35:22,856 --> 02:35:25,799
[SPEAKER_05]: There were people actually walking out because they didn't realize how gruesome it was.

1921
02:35:25,999 --> 02:35:29,182
[SPEAKER_05]: They saw people that were retarded, because you're always going to get the retarded people coming in.

1922
02:35:29,542 --> 02:35:31,564
[SPEAKER_05]: They're bringing their kids to see this movie.

1923
02:35:32,375 --> 02:35:34,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do you bring your kids to see this movie?

1924
02:35:34,376 --> 02:35:35,357
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a rated R movie.

1925
02:35:35,377 --> 02:35:36,117
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not meant for kids.

1926
02:35:36,197 --> 02:35:36,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do you bring your kids?

1927
02:35:37,137 --> 02:35:39,339
[SPEAKER_21]: Because they're stupid and don't read up on stuff to begin with.

1928
02:35:39,359 --> 02:35:44,381
[SPEAKER_05]: And then later on you're going to say, Well, I think it's all about Sin City, so that's why they ripped off Mommy's arm.

1929
02:35:44,741 --> 02:35:48,143
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I'm suing, you know, Miramax.

1930
02:35:50,244 --> 02:35:50,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck them.

1931
02:35:51,185 --> 02:35:53,406
[SPEAKER_21]: It's the world of people who can't think for themselves.

1932
02:35:54,238 --> 02:35:55,119
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, my turn.

1933
02:35:56,041 --> 02:36:09,800
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not dislike Sin City, so I don't want to be labeled as a Sin City hater, because I did enjoy the movie, but I also do not believe that this... Like, I have seen at least three different people declare this the best movie ever made, and I definitely don't think it's the best movie ever made.

1934
02:36:09,820 --> 02:36:11,081
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'll see a better movie this year.

1935
02:36:12,162 --> 02:36:13,443
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a good movie still.

1936
02:36:13,623 --> 02:36:17,504
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really want to see it again, but I thought it was a good movie and I just recommended it to Jamie.

1937
02:36:17,584 --> 02:36:21,086
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I don't have bad things to say about the movie, but here were my issue with it.

1938
02:36:21,646 --> 02:36:23,667
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very stylistic.

1939
02:36:23,747 --> 02:36:25,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it looked so sexy.

1940
02:36:25,688 --> 02:36:26,709
[SPEAKER_04]: The look was so great.

1941
02:36:27,409 --> 02:36:30,210
[SPEAKER_04]: The acting really ruined some of it for me.

1942
02:36:30,290 --> 02:36:39,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you had some people that were acting one way, like kind of that, I don't know, that element of the 30s, you know, noir style.

1943
02:36:39,254 --> 02:36:40,435
[SPEAKER_04]: And then some folks that just...

1944
02:36:41,118 --> 02:36:43,261
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would put probably Brittany Murphy in that category.

1945
02:36:43,281 --> 02:36:44,903
[SPEAKER_04]: And the chick that played...

1946
02:36:55,287 --> 02:37:14,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Goldie or whatever, and the other, I don't know, there's that Goldie chick, and then, it's basically most of the women, except for the one who played like the queen whore, like she was like queen of the whores, she was badass, okay, she was pretty cool, but a lot of the acting just kind of didn't do it for me, so, that was just me.

1947
02:37:14,523 --> 02:37:41,552
[SPEAKER_04]: and you know I just thought it went on like really really really long and I kinda would have thought a comic book movie would have been a little more fast-paced like there were some scenes in the movie that were very fast-paced and I was like when it was like really fast-paced I enjoyed it but a lot of it was just very like but don't get me wrong I didn't think it was bad I just didn't think it was like the oh my god greatest thing ever anyway um let's see more questions we do have more questions

1948
02:37:46,410 --> 02:37:48,091
[SPEAKER_04]: You can still ask questions if you want, you guys.

1949
02:37:49,652 --> 02:37:50,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1950
02:37:51,414 --> 02:37:54,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Knight wanted to follow up to something he was saying in his FU earlier.

1951
02:37:54,357 --> 02:37:56,759
[SPEAKER_04]: He said something about an employee stealing from the store.

1952
02:37:57,179 --> 02:38:04,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone got caught last night, ended up only being two cashiers that night, and I had to work in women's, so not fun.

1953
02:38:05,727 --> 02:38:07,828
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's asking, so are we having a slow cam night?

1954
02:38:07,949 --> 02:38:09,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we are having a slow cam night.

1955
02:38:09,230 --> 02:38:09,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, guys.

1956
02:38:09,758 --> 02:38:12,440
[SPEAKER_21]: That's because our special guest is hiding from the cam.

1957
02:38:12,480 --> 02:38:13,922
[SPEAKER_21]: She's stealing my shtick.

1958
02:38:16,024 --> 02:38:19,527
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm supposed to be the mysterious co-host.

1959
02:38:20,083 --> 02:38:27,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the interesting thing is that in about two or three weeks now, we're not that far away, Orange Lounge Radio Studio is moving.

1960
02:38:27,527 --> 02:38:30,568
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the new studio, the webcam will be set up completely differently.

1961
02:38:31,268 --> 02:38:31,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Above my head.

1962
02:38:32,909 --> 02:38:36,291
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be interesting to see how we set it up in the new studio.

1963
02:38:36,311 --> 02:38:38,292
[SPEAKER_21]: You can put it on my head and have the Sakura cam.

1964
02:38:38,332 --> 02:38:41,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the weird thing is we're not going to be able to do the iToy cam either, so we'll have to get creative.

1965
02:38:42,914 --> 02:38:43,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares?

1966
02:38:43,294 --> 02:38:44,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I have another webcam.

1967
02:38:44,435 --> 02:38:46,136
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't use it because I didn't like it.

1968
02:38:47,077 --> 02:38:50,859
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't really thought the logistics of the webcam out yet, so we'll see.

1969
02:38:51,960 --> 02:38:55,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, question from LXLDubes.

1970
02:38:56,123 --> 02:38:58,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Why haven't we gotten Orange Lounge Radio t-shirts yet?

1971
02:38:59,545 --> 02:39:00,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Pay for them.

1972
02:39:00,966 --> 02:39:03,368
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem with t-shirts is that...

1973
02:39:04,548 --> 02:39:08,591
[SPEAKER_04]: In order to get t-shirts, you have to buy a bunch of them up front.

1974
02:39:09,091 --> 02:39:12,073
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're not able to sell them, then you have to take a loss.

1975
02:39:12,414 --> 02:39:14,675
[SPEAKER_04]: And none of us are financially able to take a loss right now.

1976
02:39:15,076 --> 02:39:17,517
[SPEAKER_04]: What we may do, I do want to do t-shirts.

1977
02:39:17,597 --> 02:39:21,000
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have enough of a following where we could get enough small t-shirts.

1978
02:39:21,380 --> 02:39:31,547
[SPEAKER_04]: But it would be the type of thing where it's like pre-order, and I know a lot of folks don't like the pre-order thing, but that's just so that we wouldn't lose any money, you know, and we'd only order enough shirts for those that would pre-order it.

1979
02:39:31,827 --> 02:39:41,094
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we do do shirts in the future, which we are wanting to do before E3, so you may see this coming in the next month, it would probably be something where it's pre-order only.

1980
02:39:41,534 --> 02:39:47,058
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll post more details to the website when we know more information.

1981
02:39:48,600 --> 02:39:50,081
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have to get some shirt designs.

1982
02:39:50,141 --> 02:39:51,462
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know exactly what we want right now.

1983
02:39:51,602 --> 02:39:52,663
[SPEAKER_04]: OLR that hot?

1984
02:39:52,723 --> 02:39:53,343
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty good.

1985
02:39:53,524 --> 02:39:54,124
[SPEAKER_18]: That hot.

1986
02:39:55,345 --> 02:39:55,705
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1987
02:40:00,028 --> 02:40:00,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me.

1988
02:40:00,448 --> 02:40:09,254
[SPEAKER_04]: MPQ wants to know, What should I do if my Beatmania 2DX arrives before my flip-top PS2 does?

1989
02:40:10,575 --> 02:40:11,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait longer.

1990
02:40:11,816 --> 02:40:14,017
[SPEAKER_21]: You shouldn't have bought a modded PS2 to begin with.

1991
02:40:14,477 --> 02:40:15,238
[SPEAKER_21]: That's pretty stupid.

1992
02:40:17,032 --> 02:40:18,713
[SPEAKER_21]: Only buy the real thing.

1993
02:40:22,034 --> 02:40:24,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at the manual and look how pretty the manual is.

1994
02:40:24,214 --> 02:40:26,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Try to translate the Japanese in the manual.

1995
02:40:26,235 --> 02:40:26,755
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be fun.

1996
02:40:26,975 --> 02:40:33,377
[SPEAKER_21]: And see, those of us who actually have a JPS2 will be enjoying their 2DX because we bought a JPS2.

1997
02:40:34,377 --> 02:40:36,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we just had our typo of the night in the chat room.

1998
02:40:37,901 --> 02:40:38,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody was trying to say this.

1999
02:40:39,362 --> 02:40:42,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Knight said, Orange Lounge Radio is almost classified as a clut.

2000
02:40:44,726 --> 02:40:46,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Meant to say cult, but say clut.

2001
02:40:49,810 --> 02:40:51,571
[SPEAKER_21]: We just need t-shirts with typos on them.

2002
02:40:51,611 --> 02:40:52,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up, clut.

2003
02:41:00,683 --> 02:41:06,524
[SPEAKER_04]: LemonLimeJump says, I plan on gathering up a posse to get a DDR machine put in at my college.

2004
02:41:07,044 --> 02:41:08,465
[SPEAKER_04]: What's a good mix to get?

2005
02:41:09,085 --> 02:41:14,246
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess everyone will have a different opinion, but what does everyone in the studio think?

2006
02:41:15,506 --> 02:41:18,387
[SPEAKER_04]: My opinion is that extreme is kind of horrid.

2007
02:41:18,407 --> 02:41:20,728
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go almost everywhere and find an extreme.

2008
02:41:21,108 --> 02:41:24,328
[SPEAKER_04]: So really, for me, it's all about the retro at this point.

2009
02:41:24,368 --> 02:41:27,129
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think a good DDR mix, it would be fun to have retro.

2010
02:41:27,509 --> 02:41:33,940
[SPEAKER_04]: So either Fourth Plus, I think Fourth Plus is definitely a great one to have, Fifth Mix, or Third Korean.

2011
02:41:34,161 --> 02:41:35,643
[SPEAKER_21]: Fourth Plus, Third Plus.

2012
02:41:37,026 --> 02:41:39,027
[SPEAKER_04]: 3rd Plus is kind of expensive, though.

2013
02:41:39,067 --> 02:41:40,709
[SPEAKER_04]: 3rd Koreans you can get pretty cheap, can't you?

2014
02:41:41,389 --> 02:41:47,093
[SPEAKER_21]: 2nd Mix was fun, because 2nd Mix had step battle in it, and nothing is as cool as step battle.

2015
02:41:47,313 --> 02:41:54,938
[SPEAKER_04]: I would urge you to do just whatever's cheap and affordable for your college, which I believe 3rd Korean's the cheapest, so that or 4th Plus.

2016
02:41:55,318 --> 02:41:59,621
[SPEAKER_04]: 5th Mix would be a good deal, too, because there were a lot of songs in 5th Mix that didn't show up anywhere else.

2017
02:42:00,121 --> 02:42:02,983
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I think Fifth Mix is definitely something good to check out.

2018
02:42:04,044 --> 02:42:10,108
[SPEAKER_04]: But don't get, I mean, if you, of course you could always get an extreme, but the thing is that everybody has an extreme.

2019
02:42:10,448 --> 02:42:19,655
[SPEAKER_04]: So it really depends, and I don't know what kind of area you live in, but check out DDR Freak machine locations, put in your zip code, and see what kind of machines are in your area.

2020
02:42:19,735 --> 02:42:23,658
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you have three or four extreme machines within ten miles, well...

2021
02:42:24,600 --> 02:42:27,902
[SPEAKER_04]: then go for something different and that'll kind of lure people to the college.

2022
02:42:27,922 --> 02:42:32,365
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll lure the people to play those extreme machines to, you know, old stuff is new again.

2023
02:42:33,666 --> 02:42:37,408
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually surprised nobody in our chat room said, F that, get in the groove!

2024
02:42:38,389 --> 02:42:40,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Which really would be another option, honestly.

2025
02:42:41,291 --> 02:42:43,432
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be something you might want to see if there's interest in.

2026
02:42:43,812 --> 02:42:45,814
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to dog on in the groove, but you know.

2027
02:42:47,214 --> 02:42:49,416
[SPEAKER_04]: LemonLimeJump just wants to clarify, this is Pensacola.

2028
02:42:49,836 --> 02:42:51,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, I don't know the Pensacola area.

2029
02:42:52,178 --> 02:42:52,558
[SPEAKER_21]: What school?

2030
02:42:53,618 --> 02:42:55,179
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been to Florida one time.

2031
02:42:55,199 --> 02:42:55,479
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2032
02:42:55,499 --> 02:42:56,779
[SPEAKER_21]: I lived an hour from Pensacola.

2033
02:42:56,799 --> 02:42:57,160
[SPEAKER_21]: What school?

2034
02:42:58,540 --> 02:42:58,820
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2035
02:42:59,101 --> 02:43:00,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll wait for Lemon Lime Jump to respond.

2036
02:43:00,701 --> 02:43:01,622
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll talk to Lemon Lime Jump.

2037
02:43:01,642 --> 02:43:02,122
[SPEAKER_21]: Just PM me.

2038
02:43:02,242 --> 02:43:03,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2039
02:43:03,262 --> 02:43:03,743
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the thing.

2040
02:43:03,803 --> 02:43:08,945
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been in Florida for a whopping one hour in my life and it was a layover when I was seven years old.

2041
02:43:08,965 --> 02:43:10,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyway.

2042
02:43:14,293 --> 02:43:19,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Flaronay says, do you guys still have the Let Them Move MP3?

2043
02:43:19,297 --> 02:43:21,498
[SPEAKER_04]: If so, can you play it at the end of the show, please?

2044
02:43:22,159 --> 02:43:24,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, do you have that, Loki?

2045
02:43:24,320 --> 02:43:26,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't that your thing to let them move the cow?

2046
02:43:26,602 --> 02:43:27,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing the Let Them Move?

2047
02:43:27,563 --> 02:43:28,083
[SPEAKER_04]: You remember that?

2048
02:43:29,024 --> 02:43:29,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have that?

2049
02:43:30,645 --> 02:43:31,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you find it?

2050
02:43:31,646 --> 02:43:33,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you see if you still have it so I can play it?

2051
02:43:33,887 --> 02:43:34,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, see if you have that.

2052
02:43:35,668 --> 02:43:37,009
[SPEAKER_04]: We can fit that in for you, Flaronay.

2053
02:43:37,430 --> 02:43:39,291
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty funny and we haven't done that joke in months.

2054
02:43:41,713 --> 02:43:44,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Ranma says, seriously, are we going to see some Orange Launch Radio t-shirts?

2055
02:43:45,595 --> 02:43:47,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we want to do the t-shirts.

2056
02:43:48,976 --> 02:43:51,177
[SPEAKER_04]: We will have something up within the next couple weeks.

2057
02:43:51,517 --> 02:43:55,299
[SPEAKER_04]: We just need a shirt designed, so we need some folks to design a shirt for us.

2058
02:43:55,879 --> 02:43:56,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Hint, hint.

2059
02:43:56,520 --> 02:43:56,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Hint!

2060
02:43:57,840 --> 02:43:58,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we'll do a contest.

2061
02:43:59,241 --> 02:44:00,241
[SPEAKER_04]: We have CDs to give away.

2062
02:44:00,261 --> 02:44:01,122
[SPEAKER_04]: We could do a contest.

2063
02:44:02,022 --> 02:44:04,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't we have anime screeners, too, that have to get given away?

2064
02:44:04,803 --> 02:44:07,604
[SPEAKER_04]: We got the Appleseed prize pack still we got to give away at some point, huh?

2065
02:44:08,905 --> 02:44:10,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we'll do a contest.

2066
02:44:10,546 --> 02:44:11,046
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be fun.

2067
02:44:17,767 --> 02:44:21,290
[SPEAKER_04]: LemonLimeJump, just wanted to clarify, it's UWF is the school she goes to.

2068
02:44:22,451 --> 02:44:23,332
[SPEAKER_21]: University of West Florida.

2069
02:44:23,692 --> 02:44:26,054
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess, yeah.

2070
02:44:26,294 --> 02:44:30,979
[SPEAKER_04]: RPGKing7 says, question, how are you guys able to get into E3?

2071
02:44:32,200 --> 02:44:32,900
[SPEAKER_17]: DDRFreak.

2072
02:44:33,461 --> 02:44:37,565
[SPEAKER_04]: DDRFreak is a registered business, so DarkSakura is able to get in that way.

2073
02:44:37,825 --> 02:44:39,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki?

2074
02:44:40,167 --> 02:44:43,310
[SPEAKER_05]: I do game sales at my company.

2075
02:44:43,976 --> 02:44:47,042
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think you can get any more in the business than that.

2076
02:44:48,604 --> 02:44:50,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, that leaves me out in the cold this year.

2077
02:44:51,026 --> 02:45:00,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Last year I had some buddies at a particular gaming company that we talk an awful lot about on this station that helped me get into E3 and helped Loki get in as well.

2078
02:45:00,752 --> 02:45:03,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, I don't have that luxury this year, so I'm kind of on my own.

2079
02:45:04,334 --> 02:45:06,215
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know if I'm going to E3 this year.

2080
02:45:06,375 --> 02:45:07,456
[SPEAKER_04]: I will find out this week.

2081
02:45:07,696 --> 02:45:12,439
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll have something on that on Sunday because I'm going to send in the paperwork this week, so we'll see what happens.

2082
02:45:13,079 --> 02:45:16,762
[SPEAKER_04]: But actually, if I do get into E3, it'll be strictly because of Orange Lounge Radio.

2083
02:45:17,402 --> 02:45:32,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is kind of cool, but we are an official business as well now too, so... Anyway, um... SSJ100Matt Which are better video game movies or comic book based movies?

2084
02:45:32,906 --> 02:45:34,466
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, you gotta play Girls Butts.

2085
02:45:35,707 --> 02:45:38,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Girls Butts is so two weeks ago, we'll see.

2086
02:45:38,707 --> 02:45:39,908
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see about the Girls Butts thing.

2087
02:45:40,908 --> 02:45:41,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

2088
02:45:42,449 --> 02:45:45,311
[SPEAKER_04]: What are better video game... Oh, which is better?

2089
02:45:45,511 --> 02:45:48,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Video game based movies or comic book based movies?

2090
02:45:49,614 --> 02:45:52,656
[SPEAKER_04]: On the whole, I would say comic book based movies have been better.

2091
02:45:53,197 --> 02:45:54,938
[SPEAKER_21]: I would definitely second that.

2092
02:45:56,319 --> 02:46:03,524
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like comparing a BB gun with a thermonuclear warhead.

2093
02:46:05,185 --> 02:46:06,026
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no comparison.

2094
02:46:08,519 --> 02:46:24,726
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, when you look at, like, the old school Batman, I mean, that alone, right there, and then maybe, um, what else, Spider-Man was really good, it's comic book movies are awesome, and, unfortunately, um, you know, the, uh, um, of course, there have been bad comic book movies, Catwoman.

2095
02:46:27,547 --> 02:46:36,211
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that wasn't, that wasn't the comic book's fault, that was the director's fault, and we know who that director is, and we are trying to stop them as we speak, you know?

2096
02:46:37,591 --> 02:46:39,952
[SPEAKER_04]: That wasn't you, Ebol, that directed Catwoman, was it?

2097
02:46:41,412 --> 02:46:45,513
[SPEAKER_05]: I think... You sure?

2098
02:46:46,454 --> 02:46:46,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me check.

2099
02:46:47,034 --> 02:46:47,494
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna check.

2100
02:46:48,935 --> 02:46:51,635
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm almost positive.

2101
02:46:51,675 --> 02:46:52,216
[SPEAKER_04]: You do that.

2102
02:46:52,256 --> 02:46:52,756
[SPEAKER_04]: You check.

2103
02:46:54,596 --> 02:46:55,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to the database.

2104
02:46:55,557 --> 02:46:57,497
[SPEAKER_04]: But find the let them move thing first.

2105
02:46:58,137 --> 02:46:58,678
[SPEAKER_04]: We need that.

2106
02:47:01,558 --> 02:47:03,459
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't is not a term I understand.

2107
02:47:05,159 --> 02:47:06,720
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2108
02:47:09,053 --> 02:47:11,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we're running out of questions here.

2109
02:47:11,354 --> 02:47:15,095
[SPEAKER_04]: No more questions, at least I see, for Ask Orange Lounge, unless I missed something.

2110
02:47:15,115 --> 02:47:15,675
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

2111
02:47:16,276 --> 02:47:18,336
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to go ahead and close up the old mailbag there.

2112
02:47:19,397 --> 02:47:27,780
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we're going to do now is we're going to take a quick break, just a quick two-song break, and we're going to come back and a couple quick other little stories and notes, and then we're going to end tonight's show.

2113
02:47:27,860 --> 02:47:35,222
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will be back after this, featuring a very, very old DDR song and a very, very new DDR song.

2114
02:47:36,123 --> 02:47:37,083
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll be back after this.

2115
02:47:42,915 --> 02:47:48,496
[SPEAKER_28]: Boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob

2116
02:48:05,805 --> 02:48:06,925
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching.

2117
02:48:06,946 --> 02:48:08,226
[SPEAKER_13]: See you next time.

2118
02:48:39,366 --> 02:48:41,072
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

2119
02:50:37,416 --> 02:50:42,001
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Ash!

2120
02:50:42,522 --> 02:50:45,185
[SPEAKER_22]: This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.

2121
02:50:48,089 --> 02:50:50,251
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know if anyone gets that promo anymore.

2122
02:50:50,631 --> 02:50:54,674
[SPEAKER_21]: That was when we were at the house for the show.

2123
02:50:55,074 --> 02:50:55,955
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the first studio.

2124
02:50:56,295 --> 02:51:00,138
[SPEAKER_21]: And they were watching Hentai on the main TV.

2125
02:51:00,879 --> 02:51:05,282
[SPEAKER_21]: And I walk into the room and the first thing I see is animated ass all over the screen.

2126
02:51:05,622 --> 02:51:07,083
[SPEAKER_21]: So like, oh, ass.

2127
02:51:08,384 --> 02:51:09,085
[SPEAKER_21]: And then we made the promo.

2128
02:51:09,105 --> 02:51:10,026
[SPEAKER_04]: And suddenly it was a promo.

2129
02:51:12,928 --> 02:51:17,432
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, just so you guys know, we actually found something that we promised we would play.

2130
02:51:17,552 --> 02:51:19,974
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to do one other song here for you guys.

2131
02:51:20,074 --> 02:51:21,095
[SPEAKER_04]: So enjoy this.

2132
02:51:21,775 --> 02:51:23,637
[SPEAKER_04]: You should get a kick out of this or not.

2133
02:51:23,977 --> 02:51:27,580
[SPEAKER_04]: This is NMR featuring Jackazid.

2134
02:51:27,600 --> 02:51:28,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy.

2135
02:51:45,982 --> 02:51:59,691
[SPEAKER_08]: The money's a jaffa, so is the sideline, the mic's a deadline, but take the rewind, use them as guidelines, and it's wobble, wobble, wobble, wobble, wobble, wobble, wobble, wobble, wobble,

2136
02:52:33,171 --> 02:52:35,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like a dying cow at the end.

2137
02:52:37,198 --> 02:52:40,123
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Wilbert's just a spring, although that's a horse, but whatever.

2138
02:52:41,486 --> 02:52:43,890
[SPEAKER_21]: That was an old fortune cookie.

2139
02:52:44,588 --> 02:52:45,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Like years ago.

2140
02:52:45,849 --> 02:52:47,910
[SPEAKER_21]: That was like from episode 4.

2141
02:52:48,570 --> 02:52:49,691
[SPEAKER_04]: That feels weird.

2142
02:52:49,791 --> 02:52:50,831
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's that old.

2143
02:52:50,971 --> 02:52:54,093
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah, it is that old because this was when I was still not eating beef.

2144
02:52:55,754 --> 02:52:59,035
[SPEAKER_21]: And we went to, we were going to Panda Express.

2145
02:53:00,916 --> 02:53:02,657
[SPEAKER_21]: And I had that nasty eggplant crap.

2146
02:53:04,078 --> 02:53:05,879
[SPEAKER_21]: And then we were trying to think of what we were going to do.

2147
02:53:05,899 --> 02:53:07,860
[SPEAKER_21]: I was like, this eggplant makes me think of Dead Horse.

2148
02:53:09,031 --> 02:53:09,793
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks for watching!

2149
02:53:21,997 --> 02:53:22,818
[SPEAKER_04]: I always love doing this.

2150
02:53:23,038 --> 02:53:25,259
[SPEAKER_04]: We bring this up once every couple months or so.

2151
02:53:25,319 --> 02:53:30,002
[SPEAKER_04]: And since the show's gotten some additional new listeners lately, we'll do this one more time here.

2152
02:53:30,362 --> 02:53:35,165
[SPEAKER_04]: We used to do these, but they kind of took a lot of work, so we don't really do them so much anymore.

2153
02:53:35,585 --> 02:53:39,348
[SPEAKER_04]: But we used to do these little flashback promos.

2154
02:53:39,628 --> 02:53:40,268
[SPEAKER_04]: They're hilarious.

2155
02:53:40,708 --> 02:53:41,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen to this.

2156
02:53:42,309 --> 02:53:44,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Take a look back at episode number one.

2157
02:53:47,569 --> 02:53:50,231
[SPEAKER_32]: Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.

2158
02:54:10,188 --> 02:54:13,730
[SPEAKER_29]: Join us every Sunday night from 7 o'clock until 9 o'clock.

2159
02:54:13,750 --> 02:54:15,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you see how old that is?

2160
02:54:15,091 --> 02:54:16,812
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when we were on this old schedule there.

2161
02:54:16,892 --> 02:54:19,014
[SPEAKER_04]: So, very interesting there.

2162
02:54:19,414 --> 02:54:21,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen to how horrible our microphones were, too.

2163
02:54:21,835 --> 02:54:23,336
[SPEAKER_04]: I was using the headset.

2164
02:54:23,396 --> 02:54:24,897
[SPEAKER_04]: You could hear Irene in the background.

2165
02:54:24,917 --> 02:54:26,498
[SPEAKER_04]: She sounded like she was in a tin can.

2166
02:54:26,718 --> 02:54:29,440
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like, what is going on, you guys?

2167
02:54:30,261 --> 02:54:32,142
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm on Orange Lounge.

2168
02:54:32,542 --> 02:54:35,904
[SPEAKER_21]: I was using the headset and I ended up with like a migraine by the end of the show.

2169
02:54:36,505 --> 02:54:38,306
[SPEAKER_21]: Remember I passed out in the show?

2170
02:54:39,927 --> 02:54:40,688
[SPEAKER_21]: That was terrible.

2171
02:54:40,708 --> 02:54:41,328
[SPEAKER_21]: We were in the front.

2172
02:54:41,368 --> 02:54:42,309
[SPEAKER_21]: We were in the living room.

2173
02:54:44,890 --> 02:54:46,091
[SPEAKER_21]: That was certainly fun.

2174
02:54:46,231 --> 02:54:47,372
[SPEAKER_21]: And then I went to LA.

2175
02:54:48,072 --> 02:54:48,413
[SPEAKER_04]: You did.

2176
02:54:48,473 --> 02:54:49,713
[SPEAKER_04]: So you were gone for a couple weeks.

2177
02:54:50,514 --> 02:54:51,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do one more flashback.

2178
02:54:51,855 --> 02:54:52,455
[SPEAKER_04]: These are kind of fun.

2179
02:54:52,475 --> 02:54:53,336
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the flashbacks.

2180
02:54:54,036 --> 02:54:56,258
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys can respect the roots of Orange Lingerie.

2181
02:54:56,278 --> 02:55:03,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do a flashback from episode... Let's do a flashback from episode four.

2182
02:55:06,460 --> 02:55:08,080
[SPEAKER_04]: on Orange Lounge Radio.

2183
02:55:34,460 --> 02:55:35,642
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, every night on the show.

2184
02:55:39,306 --> 02:55:40,788
[SPEAKER_21]: As Irene makes his face.

2185
02:55:41,268 --> 02:55:44,212
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge Radio makes you moist as a snake.

2186
02:55:44,272 --> 02:55:47,156
[SPEAKER_32]: Join us every Sunday night from 7 p.m.

2187
02:55:47,216 --> 02:55:48,237
[SPEAKER_32]: until 9 p.m.

2188
02:55:48,257 --> 02:55:50,980
[SPEAKER_32]: Pacific Standard Time for the Orange Lounge.

2189
02:55:51,801 --> 02:55:52,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie was moist.

2190
02:55:55,573 --> 02:55:56,794
[SPEAKER_07]: and I still am.

2191
02:55:56,975 --> 02:55:59,437
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember she got pissed off about that one too.

2192
02:55:59,577 --> 02:55:59,877
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.

2193
02:55:59,897 --> 02:56:02,340
[SPEAKER_13]: She's like, don't put that in the promo.

2194
02:56:02,380 --> 02:56:02,800
[SPEAKER_13]: You can't.

2195
02:56:02,940 --> 02:56:04,101
[SPEAKER_13]: Why did you do that?

2196
02:56:04,161 --> 02:56:05,182
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob, why?

2197
02:56:06,604 --> 02:56:06,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

2198
02:56:06,884 --> 02:56:08,085
[SPEAKER_04]: But now she can laugh about it.

2199
02:56:08,165 --> 02:56:08,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

2200
02:56:08,646 --> 02:56:09,046
[SPEAKER_04]: I said.

2201
02:56:09,066 --> 02:56:09,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

2202
02:56:09,386 --> 02:56:09,667
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

2203
02:56:09,747 --> 02:56:10,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

2204
02:56:10,067 --> 02:56:10,267
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

2205
02:56:10,287 --> 02:56:10,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

2206
02:56:10,567 --> 02:56:10,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2207
02:56:10,728 --> 02:56:10,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah.

2208
02:56:18,979 --> 02:56:25,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, before we finish up the show, give us some more PSP hacking news, because this is what you're all about ever since you got a PSP.

2209
02:56:25,394 --> 02:56:27,038
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed you were watching a video earlier.

2210
02:56:27,058 --> 02:56:27,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, tell us about that, too.

2211
02:56:28,493 --> 02:56:30,514
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the great game launcher.

2212
02:56:30,594 --> 02:56:34,115
[SPEAKER_05]: You honestly have to, like, seriously twist a PSP to get it to launch a game.

2213
02:56:34,575 --> 02:56:37,737
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know about you, but who twists a fucking, you know, console system?

2214
02:56:38,077 --> 02:56:38,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Wipeout!

2215
02:56:39,758 --> 02:56:42,138
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't need to twist a damn game for Wipeout!

2216
02:56:42,619 --> 02:56:44,159
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't twist it when I play Wipeout.

2217
02:56:44,459 --> 02:56:47,120
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't, like, some sort of JogCon type thing.

2218
02:56:47,601 --> 02:56:49,561
[SPEAKER_05]: This is, you know, a game system.

2219
02:56:49,601 --> 02:56:50,702
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't try to twist it.

2220
02:56:50,802 --> 02:56:51,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course it's gonna break.

2221
02:56:52,683 --> 02:56:53,623
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not meant to twist.

2222
02:56:54,764 --> 02:56:55,864
[SPEAKER_05]: God, people are retarded.

2223
02:56:56,468 --> 02:57:03,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, so yeah, apparently the PSP IRC thing has been slash dotted, so that went that site.

2224
02:57:03,692 --> 02:57:09,054
[SPEAKER_05]: And same with the PSP browser, that has been slash dotted as well, so that site's down.

2225
02:57:11,476 --> 02:57:14,577
[SPEAKER_05]: What's this?

2226
02:57:14,637 --> 02:57:16,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Haha, funny.

2227
02:57:19,299 --> 02:57:24,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man, honestly, who the hell does this kind of stuff is what I want to know.

2228
02:57:26,221 --> 02:57:27,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Another news, though.

2229
02:57:28,964 --> 02:57:30,205
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be reporting this later.

2230
02:57:31,986 --> 02:57:35,149
[SPEAKER_05]: It has been done, and the first alpha will be coming out next month.

2231
02:57:35,429 --> 02:57:37,451
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, Linux is on the DS.

2232
02:57:38,872 --> 02:57:39,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Go Linux.

2233
02:57:40,714 --> 02:57:43,836
[SPEAKER_05]: If it runs with electricity, there will be Linux on it.

2234
02:57:44,737 --> 02:57:45,778
[SPEAKER_20]: Linux for the toaster.

2235
02:57:46,478 --> 02:57:47,740
[SPEAKER_05]: I want Linux for a toaster.

2236
02:57:48,740 --> 02:57:50,202
[SPEAKER_05]: And from what I read, iTunes.

2237
02:57:50,722 --> 02:57:51,603
[SPEAKER_05]: iTunes for the PSP.

2238
02:57:54,275 --> 02:58:01,940
[SPEAKER_04]: I will never understand what the charm is about being able to install Linux on insert system here.

2239
02:58:02,301 --> 02:58:02,961
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand.

2240
02:58:03,562 --> 02:58:08,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that just because people think they're going to be able to run all the Linux programs on it and everything?

2241
02:58:09,526 --> 02:58:10,266
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand.

2242
02:58:10,346 --> 02:58:13,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do people try to install Linux on, like, what was the one we had?

2243
02:58:13,829 --> 02:58:16,851
[SPEAKER_04]: The fish on the wall had Linux installed on it?

2244
02:58:17,291 --> 02:58:18,132
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell is that?

2245
02:58:19,056 --> 02:58:19,796
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I want to do?

2246
02:58:20,177 --> 02:58:22,978
[SPEAKER_05]: And I realized this the other day when I was looking at my PSP.

2247
02:58:22,998 --> 02:58:24,499
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, what the hell is this button?

2248
02:58:24,939 --> 02:58:25,919
[SPEAKER_05]: What is this thing?

2249
02:58:26,299 --> 02:58:27,700
[SPEAKER_05]: What is this little thing on the top here?

2250
02:58:28,080 --> 02:58:28,921
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an infrared port.

2251
02:58:29,681 --> 02:58:30,461
[SPEAKER_05]: So you know what you can do?

2252
02:58:30,642 --> 02:58:31,662
[SPEAKER_05]: You can use this as a remote.

2253
02:58:31,982 --> 02:58:35,144
[SPEAKER_05]: I want a program on here where I can turn off TVs with the PSP.

2254
02:58:38,605 --> 02:58:41,487
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can walk around Walmart just, you know, getting the electronics out.

2255
02:58:41,547 --> 02:58:43,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm just, I'm trying out a PSP.

2256
02:58:44,168 --> 02:58:45,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Click, click, click, click, all the TVs are going off.

2257
02:58:46,573 --> 02:58:47,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I want to get one.

2258
02:58:47,334 --> 02:58:48,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't you order one of those keychains?

2259
02:58:48,374 --> 02:58:50,236
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you were going to order the keychain that shuts them all off.

2260
02:58:51,277 --> 02:58:52,257
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I never got around to that.

2261
02:58:52,698 --> 02:58:53,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn.

2262
02:58:53,218 --> 02:58:55,540
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to get one and we need to figure out how to increase the strength of this.

2263
02:58:55,980 --> 02:58:56,861
[SPEAKER_04]: And go in the Best Buy.

2264
02:58:58,202 --> 02:58:59,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch the magic.

2265
02:59:01,924 --> 02:59:02,745
[SPEAKER_21]: Like an EMP?

2266
02:59:02,765 --> 02:59:04,727
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.

2267
02:59:04,747 --> 02:59:09,250
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember what it does, but it's like a little thing that you put on your keychain.

2268
02:59:09,270 --> 02:59:15,795
[SPEAKER_04]: And what it does is it basically cycles through like a hundred different popular televisions and their power off signal.

2269
02:59:16,280 --> 02:59:17,721
[SPEAKER_21]: That's awesome, I want one.

2270
02:59:18,162 --> 02:59:25,868
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can like go in, if the TV's too loud at a restaurant or whatever, you just get out your little keychain, boop, and if you hold it for 15 seconds, eventually the TV will turn off.

2271
02:59:26,488 --> 02:59:32,093
[SPEAKER_21]: I still want the portable EMP, so I can aim it at people's cell phones while they're driving.

2272
02:59:32,854 --> 02:59:35,496
[SPEAKER_05]: I was thinking, I need to find the...

2273
02:59:36,823 --> 02:59:38,004
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2274
03:00:02,407 --> 03:00:03,728
[SPEAKER_05]: I found three different networks.

2275
03:00:03,989 --> 03:00:04,949
[SPEAKER_05]: One with the password on it.

2276
03:00:05,090 --> 03:00:06,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, actually, two with passwords.

2277
03:00:06,451 --> 03:00:07,031
[SPEAKER_05]: One that's not.

2278
03:00:08,533 --> 03:00:17,320
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, it's sort of like, you know, a dumb person's version of, you know, I forget, War Driving.

2279
03:00:18,802 --> 03:00:22,285
[SPEAKER_04]: You should walk around the complex and you just look like you're playing your PSP.

2280
03:00:22,505 --> 03:00:24,567
[SPEAKER_04]: But can you download files from the networks?

2281
03:00:24,687 --> 03:00:25,728
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not on the PSP yet.

2282
03:00:26,562 --> 03:00:29,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Not yet, but I was reading some other things today on the site.

2283
03:00:30,104 --> 03:00:35,026
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a cord out there for the Mini-B, which is this little mini-USB port.

2284
03:00:35,186 --> 03:00:39,189
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a proprietary thing, of course, to Sony, their Mini-B.

2285
03:00:40,549 --> 03:00:48,173
[SPEAKER_05]: It's USB-A, which is your standard USB, the female part, so you can actually plug in USB devices to the Mini-B port.

2286
03:00:48,693 --> 03:00:55,157
[SPEAKER_05]: So, in theory, you could put flash drives or whatever, USB flash drives, hook it up to the PSP via this...

2287
03:00:55,957 --> 03:00:58,678
[SPEAKER_05]: or, like I was thinking, a portable hard drive.

2288
03:00:59,978 --> 03:01:02,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Imagine, 160 gigs on my PSP.

2289
03:01:05,240 --> 03:01:10,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, more PSP pirating and hacking news to come later on Orange Lounge Radio.

2290
03:01:10,522 --> 03:01:11,942
[SPEAKER_04]: But for now, that's it.

2291
03:01:12,002 --> 03:01:12,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Three hours are up.

2292
03:01:13,903 --> 03:01:17,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Tune into the podcast if you want to know more.

2293
03:01:18,244 --> 03:01:20,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Time to go around and get everybody's final thought.

2294
03:01:20,245 --> 03:01:21,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Angel, your final thought.

2295
03:01:23,260 --> 03:01:26,503
[SPEAKER_19]: I need to recharge my PSP, er, not PSP, DS.

2296
03:01:26,983 --> 03:01:28,084
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, my brain's not working.

2297
03:01:28,144 --> 03:01:28,424
[SPEAKER_19]: Bye.

2298
03:01:31,146 --> 03:01:31,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Julie.

2299
03:01:31,767 --> 03:01:32,988
[SPEAKER_26]: I want to kill some Sims.

2300
03:01:33,748 --> 03:01:34,289
[SPEAKER_26]: It's fun.

2301
03:01:35,490 --> 03:01:36,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Killing Sims is fun.

2302

03:01:38,832 --> 03:01:45,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, do you have the, um, the, uh, what was it, the college update for, um, Sims 2?

2304
03:01:47,099 --> 03:01:48,440
[SPEAKER_26]: Not yet, but I want to get that.

2305
03:01:48,500 --> 03:01:49,681
[SPEAKER_26]: Then I can kill more of them.

2306
03:01:50,362 --> 03:01:50,602
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

2307
03:01:52,362 --> 03:01:56,323

03:01:58,044 --> 03:01:59,124
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

2309
03:01:59,524 --> 03:02:00,565

03:02:02,445 --> 03:02:03,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Last word of the show.

2311
03:02:03,786 --> 03:02:05,026
[SPEAKER_04]: One word to sum it all up.

2312
03:02:05,486 --> 03:02:06,727
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to give it to Julie tonight.

2313
03:02:06,987 --> 03:02:09,228
[SPEAKER_04]: One word to sum everything up and it's the final word of the show.

2314
03:02:09,268 --> 03:02:09,828

[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Sweet Potatoes, Baked Potatoes, Potato Chips, Whoa, Smoked Sausage, Fried Chicken, Pepperoni Pizza, and Deluxe Dips.

2320
03:03:06,052 --> 03:03:11,056
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody can make a donut, do the things you do.

2321
03:03:12,333 --> 03:03:39,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Believe me baby, believe me baby, I've tried what I feel, I've eaten meatballs in Sweden, and pork chops in Peru, but all I did, all I did, all I did, all I did, all I did was remind me of you baby, and your mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, oh baby, mashed butter.

03:04:27,205 --> 03:04:32,847

[SPEAKER_04]: We'll just reconnect to the stream in about 15 seconds to resume listening to all your favorite EDR, 2DX, and Dance Mania favorites.

03:04:41,710 --> 03:04:43,831
[SPEAKER_04]: In the studio, we have actually a clock.

2330
03:04:44,278 --> 03:04:45,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Laziness prevails again.

2331
03:05:11,567 --> 03:05:13,571
[SPEAKER_04]: And on that thought, have a great night everybody.
