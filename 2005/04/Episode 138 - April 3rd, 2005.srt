00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,720

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,720
She'll be fighting captain for this baby watching travel day.

77
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,100
found the sound clip we wanted to play very badly for you guys last week we

78
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,280
played it about a year ago which is a little bit of a hint as to what it is

79
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,260
we were talking about a little something something last week and we finally found

80
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:22,300
the sound clip of it to play tonight so it's it's wonderful so we're gonna play

81
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,860
it doesn't have me saying anything you know no it's actually not a sound clip

82
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,140
of you. It's a sound clip of somebody not even on this show, but that's what makes it

83
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:37,060
funny. We'll discuss what that is in a little bit, don't worry. I'll give you a hint during

84
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:45,060
break. Alright, speaking of break, let's get to it. In this break, some random music. We'll

85
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:50,060
start it off with a little bit of French counting. So if you want to learn how to count to three,

86
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:54,060
just listen very carefully to the lyrics of the song. We'll be back after this with more

87
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,060
Orange Lounge Radio. Enjoy!

88
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:41,060
Can you be your fantasy, give me ecstasy

89
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,060
Now tell me why

90
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,060
Tell me why

91
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,060
Now tell me why

92
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:27,060
Let me go, let me go Let me go, let me go

93
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,060
There's only one

94
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:39,060
I see it all day, and they make me wonder

95
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,060
It's overloaded

96
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:55,060
Good, good, baddle, baddle, bitch, I move out

97
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:55,560
C'mon

98
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:12,380
Don't don't sleep on me, please Don't don't sleep on me

99
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:19,380
I'm gonna take you away And let it show you the way

100
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:26,380
We didn't go in the skyline With the speed

101
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:33,380
Fly away, fly away I'm gonna take you away

102
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:40,900
And even though it's not love, it's just fear

103
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:49,460
Fly away from the sea, feeling love instantly

104
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:54,020
Until we reach eternity

105
00:12:54,020 --> 00:13:23,060
Hi Ho, Karmit D. Fogg here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is

106
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:27,060
Brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

107
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:32,060
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

108
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:37,060
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 138.

109
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,060
In progress here on this lovely April night.

110
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,060
Hope you guys had an interesting April Fool's Day.

111
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:46,060
I know there were a lot of interesting pranks that were played out there by some various websites.

112
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:51,060
Of course, one of the biggest sites I'm sure most of us who listen to this program visit once in a while,

113
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:56,540
in a while the DDR freak did a joke but it wasn't really a joke which was kind

114
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:01,500
of funny they went in the groove for a day they're gonna turn to in the groove

115
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,360
freak but it frickin wasn't a joke like they actually added an in the groove

116
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,820
section so I thought that was kind of funny like kind of with the jokes on you

117
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,180
type thing but that made me giggle how long did you know that you guys were

118
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,580
doing that because you're a moderator over there so you get special privileges

119
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:19,200
huh you know given the why am I so loud I don't know you're given the issue with

120
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,120
last year. I just sort of sat back and let everybody else do their thing and I was like

121
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,520
yeah I'm not even gonna. Seriously like last year was a lot and I couldn't believe some

122
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,880
of the response the joke was getting on DDR4 because people were like oh this is this sucks

123
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:39,600
compared to last year. Last year was funny. And I'm going like okay last year was like

124
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,920
too much. I'm like you cannot outdo what they did last year because what happened last year

125
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:51,640
was over the top. Last year, the best part about it was actually getting everything that

126
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:59,640
led up to April Fool's Day. Because we were all becoming power hungry, egomaniac. It was

127
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:07,560
basically wrestling drama. Basically. It was like you all got to be WWE members for a minute.

128
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:12,840
We were all like, screw y'all. We are all admins and we are going to just take over

129
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:21,840
the whole page. And then, all chaos broke loose on New Year's.

130
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:26,840
See, my brain's all, I swear it's Daylight Savings Time if I can win my head.

131
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,840
Oh, I have a lot to say about Daylight Savings Time in a little bit.

132
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:35,840
But seriously though, last year was so much fun this year, I'm like, nothing will ever

133
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,840
be what last year was, so I just sat back and let it happen. Like, this is your puppy.

134
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:45,200
Well, here's the thing, everybody's saying that, you know, it doesn't top last year and

135
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,600
it wasn't funny and it wasn't creative and it was too obvious, but I think what people

136
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:55,820
don't get is that the actual joke was not the fact that DDR Freak was going to turn

137
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,080
into In The Groove Freak.

138
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:02,000
The joke was is that it was something that they really were going to add to the site

139
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,640
and keep, so it was kind of like one of those not a joke jokes.

140
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,640
Gotcha twice!

141
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,640
Kinda.

142
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,640
I don't know how to put it.

143
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,640
Yeah.

144
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,920
Now, everybody knows I was a very vocal critic of last year's joke.

145
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,320
I did not enjoy last year's joke.

146
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,000
I thought it was way over the top, not necessary.

147
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,960
So I much prefer this year's joke.

148
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,360
I'll tell you what, part of the joke was getting the angry reactions, though.

149
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,440
That was part of the good thing.

150
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,440
No offense.

151
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,960
No, that's all right.

152
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:36,040
But last year's joke was stupid, so I'm glad that this year's joke was a little more tame

153
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,040
and kind of funny.

154
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,040
Yeah, good thing we didn't do anything.

155
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,040
Yeah, I know.

156
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,000
We decided to stay out of the April Fools thing, because you know, I don't think April

157
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Fools is that funny at all.

158
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
No.

159
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Exactly.

160
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Boy caught it.

161
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Uh-huh.

162
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
So anyway, where was I?

163
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Oh, yes.

164
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,320
Oh, we're going to play that, because we might have some new people listening to the show.

165
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,720
You're going to hear us repeat a lot of this stuff through the month of April, because

166
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,160
we got that nomination for Broadcaster of the Year for the Best of Life 365.

167
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,720
So thank you, hugs and kisses to Life 365, thank you.

168
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:12,440
We feel very honored and, frankly, somewhat surprised that we got nominated for that,

169
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,440
you know?

170
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,440
Most unlike...

171
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,440
I'm not surprised at all.

172
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,440
I mean, after all...

173
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,440
What?

174
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,440
No, seriously.

175
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,440
You've got...

176
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,060
You have my gorgeous voice.

177
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:28,160
We have our violent and angry young man here.

178
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,680
And then we have you.

179
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,160
Yeah, and then there's the gay.

180
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,200
And then we have the gay.

181
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,520
I don't know, I'm not surprised at all. We put enough work into this, we deserve our

182
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:49,520
kudos, dammit. Well thank you for being so humble about everything, I appreciate it.

183
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:56,800
We are fucking celebrities. Okay, the internet loves us.

184
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,560
Well in all reality I'm going to come down to, you know, planet earth here. I don't know

185
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,800
where Jamie's at right now. I'm going to come down to planet earth here.

186
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:13,360
you guys but it's just funny to see everybody that's nominated for

187
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,200
broadcaster the year and you've got some really frickin fantabulous stations

188
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,160
folks that are probably I don't know this for sure I'm speculating here but

189
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,960
I'm guessing there's one at least one or two stations in there where that is what

190
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:32,120
they do is like 365 so to be nominated amongst that is like awesome I don't

191
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,760
even know how to put it and it's our listeners who helped us get there so you

192
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:39,160
know kisses to you guys you know I have to make a mention to the chat room yes

193
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:45,320
no we are not going to have Roberto or Jaime thank you yes no we are not going

194
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:51,360
to be an espanol we will be in Esperanto now if now if we wanted to do the April

195
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,480
Fool's thing which we don't having the station in Spanish one day would have

196
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,720
been pretty funny so we got to write these down for next year if we wish is

197
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,080
incredibly funny because I don't speak any Spanish except for el telefono es

198
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:13,200
en fuego which translates to the telephone is on fire don de esta el

199
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,360
bano that's the only one I know where is the bathroom because you know if you're

200
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,400

202
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,400

203
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,160
actually nominated for Best of the Life 365 last year in the category of Most Unlikely

204
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:40,120
to Hear on AM-FM radio, which we got nominated in again this year, which is very cool. So

205
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:46,080
there's, you know, two places to nominate us. However, something very funny happened.

206
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,240
Three of us, all three of them, myself, Dark Sakura, and Loki, we all went to the awards

207
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:56,940
ceremony, and this is what happened when we got there. Okay, Most Unlikely to Hear on

217
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:07,420
through the whole thing okay now listen though very careful I'm

218
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,860
going to play a little clip of this again listen very carefully after they

219
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:14,700
announced Pokemon radio which was the last one they read they start to open

220
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:20,680
the envelope listen very carefully to what happens in the background radio PIRN

221
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:30,080
in that I you distinctly hear Loki back there going hey hey this doesn't fly hey

222
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:37,640
lady I wasted a tank of gas to get here I'm drunk

223
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:45,440
say my name bitch say my name I think you and I were the only ones who drank

224
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,400
no I think Loki didn't you kick back a beer or two no you were driving you had

225
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,720
to drive. Somebody had to be responsible. Well I don't know why Loki was saying hey,

226
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:02,060
he wasn't driving. I think I had like a Sapporo, a Heineken, and Guinness. I'm like, let's

227
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:11,600
have the international alcohol today. So then of course, just as a reminder. Oh yeah, Orange

228
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:17,040
Lounge was nominated as well. They didn't make it to the envelope, sorry about that.

229
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:28,400
we we printed them separately so they might have. I had no idea what that excuse was. And the winner goes to Fluffertracks, Vanyavich. Yay, hooray for the porno radio station.

230
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,240
Hooray for them. Okay, yeah, great. So just as a reminder, we didn't win last year,

231
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:39,200
so we'd really appreciate your vote this year. So head on over to www.orangetownstrator.com

232
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,080
and it has a link so you can go to the ballot on line 365 and vote. So I hope you

233
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:47,960
all take a second to do that. And maybe this year we will be remembered on the envelope.

234
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:55,440
This year, we need to make a scene. They need to realize that it is stations like us who

235
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,220
make the money for them. Oh wait, you're up, oh I'm sorry, Planet

236
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:04,800
Earth's down here and you're up here again. No seriously, if it wasn't for us and the

237
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,080
fact that people keep wanting to listen to us and we have to pay them more money to enable

238
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:14,360
our listeners to enjoy us do you think that maybe the fact that we somehow

239
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,040
actually got nominated broadcaster years a little bit of an apology for that last

240
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:24,520
year like oh shit we better make it up to them somehow they better have a table

241
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:32,680
separated for us well but this is a weird thing with rose petals and like

242
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:45,580
some nice champagne and waffles I demand waffles here's the crazy thing we

243
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:48,700
actually have quite a few listeners in the Bay Area where this show's award

244
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:52,780
ceremony is going to take place a lot of people have been asking me if they can

245
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:58,540
go we have totally have got to carry the totally have to make up the choreography

246
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:03,380
for, um, yeah, choreography for, like, something, something sort of, like, you know, the West

247
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:08,860
Side Story, just come in, just start, just like, all just, like, come in and just, like,

248
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,420
you know, prance around you, that'd be fucking hilarious.

249
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:15,620
Actually, we will be taking official sign-ups on our website pretty soon for the official

250
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:20,340
Orange Lounge Radio Entourage. The folks that will be going with us to the award show, they

251
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:23,340
have to have 20 bucks, because it costs 20 bucks to go to the show, and you have to have

252
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:27,660
your own way over there or something, fine, because we, we don't have a big van or anything,

253
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:31,260
make sure you can find a ride to the hotel where this is gonna be at and I

254
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:35,520
forget where it is I'll look it up later in the show and give it to you guys but

255
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,840
we do need people to actually be carrying the red carpet so that when

256
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:43,480
Jamie, Loki, myself arrive they can roll it out so we can walk on it and walk in

257
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:50,720
that is awesome and it needs to be crushed velvet do you think I'm kidding

258
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,800
the sad thing is ladies and gentlemen she's not alright anyway so more to come

259
00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:06,960
on that a little later so I don't want to keep dragging this segment out for now

260
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,720
I'm going to return to this because life 365 now we know you're listening yeah we

261
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,840
know there's you snubbed us last year now that we are really huge and we are

262
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:24,800
bigger this year we are we are bigger than we have play on DDR free radio yeah

263
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,200
And I'd say we're bigger than the Pope, but that would be in very poor taste this week,

264
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,600
so we're not bigger than that right now.

265
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:35,080
But we're bigger than, um, um...

266
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,080
We are bigger than Goatsee.

267
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,840
Yeah, we're bigger than Goatsee.

268
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,840
I agree.

269
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,840
We are.

270
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,680
We are bigger than big.

271
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:46,200
And so you have, you better get out the chapstick because you're going to be kissing our ass

272
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,200
so much this year.

273
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:53,100
Oh my gosh, you know how much, do you know how many fellow broadcasters are listening

274
00:25:53,100 --> 00:26:00,100
to this for the first time going, what a bunch of stuck up bitches. See if they get our vote.

275
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,360
Jamie really is a polite individual. If you meet her in person, she's a big fluffy hug

276
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:11,280
monster when you meet her. She just, you know. I really am cute and adorable, aren't I? Don't

277
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:16,960
push it. Alright, anyway. Seriously, I'm glad we got the nominations this year. Yes, I'm

278
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,400
very glad too. I was surprised. I'm not bitter at all about last year. It's an excuse for

279
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:28,020
me to drink more expensive alcohol and have a good time.

280
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:33,380
Encouraging our fellow broadcasters to continue to give the finger to conventional radio.

281
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,380
Exactly.

282
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,380
That's what this is really all about, is giving the finger to conventional radio.

283
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:42,260
We're about protecting our first amendment rights and saying, hey, regular radio, y'all

284
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,260
can kiss my ass.

285
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,260
That's right.

286
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:48,300
We are about, we want to be able to say fucking shit on the air and we are all about, you

287
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,700
know, our right to, you know, say whatever we want.

288
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,820
If we want to tell dick and fart jokes for three hours, that's what we're going to do.

289
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,100
That's practically what we do anyway.

290
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,100
I know.

291
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,100
Anyway.

292
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:02,020
And we've been doing this for two and a half years.

293
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,260
Moving on.

294
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:06,620
Let's start off tonight's show, but outside of that little rant, we usually start off

295
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,620
the show with a little bit of, how was your week, how was your day, so let's back up a

296
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,620
little bit.

297
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,580
DarkStalker, how was your week, how was your day?

298
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:16,820
Busy as all get out, oh my god.

299
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:22,900
know the week before was spring break so now that spring break's over my ass is

300
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:27,900
back in having to do all this crap for school and my teachers have actually

301
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:32,360
taken a bit of mercy on us although I did skip my art class on Wednesday

302
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:37,380
because I was just worn out from running at the gym but I'm full swing in my

303
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:42,500
training schedule as well training for the mud run so I can get all dirty and

304
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:51,200
icky and ogle at the Marines, hurr. So I ran Monday and Wednesday, worked out a

305
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:58,580
little bit elsewhere in the week, did a lot of shopping. We paid off all of our

306
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:07,920
bills, hahaha, such a good feeling. Really this week's just been me either going to

307
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:14,340
work, going to the gym, or doing school crap, or working on my fan project, or working on

308
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:20,300
stuff for the radio station, which I've actually been coming up with a few ideas.

309
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,980
I'm going to be coming up with a few more.

310
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:27,060
And Lemon Lime Jump, that's cool that your sister's a Marine, my little brother's a Marine

311
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:29,860
too.

312
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:37,700
So it's just really been pretty busy.

313
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:42,340
Oh, yeah, I did though hang out yesterday with iguana girl and Tia

314
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:46,020
We went shopping. We did girly stuff all day

315
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,260
Did y'all go get makeovers and pedicures and you know what no

316
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,140
Baby and tried on jeans, okay

317
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:58,420
For like an hour and a half. Yeah, I could do that and I'm not a girl. I

318
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,300
like clothes and

319
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:07,380
It's just it's very frustrating right now because I'm in between sizes. So nothing I try on fit worth a damn

320
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:12,420
I have a question. Why is it that pants sizes for, you know, for girls, um, they're always

321
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:20,420
like, you know, 14, 16, 18, where are the juniors? Oh, I never knew that. So that means

322
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:24,820
I could go to Target. This is cool. I can actually shop in the junior section at Target

323
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:30,780
now. That makes me very happy because then I can get stuff cheap now and I can go to

324
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:36,620
thrift stores too. Thrift store shopping is awesome. I went to thrift store the other

325
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,540
They had a bunch of crap.

326
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:41,380
I almost bought some vinyl pants though.

327
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,380
That's awesome.

328
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,380
But they were cut really funny.

329
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:52,560
And then I went today, because it was a stupid daylight savings time, my ass was up until

330
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:57,880
4 o'clock, which I was up until 5.30 on Friday, so it's all good.

331
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:04,740
And then I went out to lunch with Dan, and we went to the Eastern buffet because I had

332
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:09,320
a free meal over there. Which is a Chinese food buffet, right? Yeah, it used to be really

333
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:13,320
gross but they were pretty good today. That's good. I had a good dim sum. And then I went

334
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:19,540
to, we went to Dimple, which is, it's a local record store chain used in new stuff. They

335
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:27,540
usually overprice all their old DVDs. Excuse me. But we found like the motherload of Atari

336
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:32,860
games. It was awesome. In fact, I've got a list here of what we found. For anyone who

337
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:44,540
is a classic gaming nut like me and my man are. We got the Star Trek Star Fleet Academy

338
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:55,000
thing that was on the Atari 2600 back in the day. And we also picked up, you know I have

339
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,040
it right in front of me can't believe them okay we also picked up junior

340
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:05,920
pac-man frog or two and journey escape which was actually the band journey now

341
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:10,360
I remember the journey video game in the arcades like back in the 80s it was

342
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:14,400
awesome because it actually had like MIDI style don't stop believing and open

343
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,800
arms and stuff that played in the background but what is journey escape on

344
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,240
the Atari was it the same thing you haven't even played it in but it's one

345
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,200
of the rare you need to check it out because I want to know if it's just like

346
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:29,160
the arcade game or if it's like a whole different adventure well I also was

347
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:35,040
digging around for to replace some CDs that I've since lost and I was off

348
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:40,540
looking for actually specifically today I was looking for blur CDs but as I was

349
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:47,280
walking down to the register this tape caught my eye from the side and it

350
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:51,560
turned out to be a gorillas promo DVD I'm not DVD but a VHS and gorillas is

351
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:56,440
band you've really been getting into lately right yes and and what is don't

352
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,320
give me that no no I'm just let me give you let me warm up my eyes a little bit

353
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:06,520
Oh precious dark sacro what is the charm of the gorillas no I seriously what is

354
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:12,260
it because it's like it's like half art half music half fandom which is three

355
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:16,120
halves but I don't really indescribable just go to the website and you will be

356
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:23,500
lost for hours digging through the studio. All right. I don't have enough

357
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:29,680
time in the show to go into it so I won't. Just read my live journal. All

358
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,320
right, fair enough. Speaking of live journal, we have a Orange Lounge live

359
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:37,120
journal community. It's www.livejournal.com slash users slash

360
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:41,800
Orange Lounge. All one word. Nice plug. No problem. And I haven't really plugged our

361
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,320
chat room tonight either so let me give that a shout out. www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com

362
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:53,000
click on chat. Loki, how was your week? How was your day? My week's been all over

363
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,880
the place. Well, let's see, starting with Monday. Monday was kind of eh, it didn't

364
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,840
really do anything. Tuesday, they finally announced that I got the job at my

365
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:09,080
company, so now I'm actually game sales now with a nice bonus and pay raise, so

366
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:14,120
that was cool. Congratulations. And so now I'll be selling games and that kind of

367
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:21,100
stuff so that'd be cool then also let's see what else happened then Wednesday

368
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:26,100
nothing really much actually you fast forward to about Friday Friday went saw

369
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:38,100
Sin City that was awesome then yesterday I went and got a PSP because I just have

370
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:42,080
to have a PSP to mess around with so that was kind of cool got wiped out pure

371
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:48,600
and twisted metal head on and then I hit a car and that sucked that was kind of

372
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,360
the down point of the day it didn't do any damage to the car really I mean

373
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:56,600
other than some paint scrapes I looked at my car there's a little bit of a bent

374
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,560
part on next to the headlight but I mean it didn't even break the headlight or

375
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:05,240
anything and the bent parts just like ever so slightly and I mean you

376
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:09,800
honestly looking at it you wouldn't even notice and so you know I had to call my

377
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,400
insurance company and do all that crap so that's just suck but honestly I don't

378
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,320
think anything's gonna happen cuz I mean they've been lowering my insurance you

379
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:22,080
know for like the last I don't even know how many years and you know didn't do

380
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:29,440
any damage to my car so now we're all good and then what else then yesterday

381
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:36,960
played some clue because that's awesome and today after you know a short recess

382
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,600
of you know not having them for a while I got the Sunday headache again but it's

383
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,920
kind of fun though today with my PSP because I'm actually researching for the

384
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:51,360
future for our website PSP access you know special page IRC that kind of crap

385
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:55,440
so I actually got on well of course no one in our chats can be able to see it

386
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,700
because it's in our mod for us but I got on and actually made a post on orange

387
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,960
lounge radio with a PSP that's kind of amazing and the way now for those who

388
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:09,120
don't know the way this has been done is there's actually on wipeout pure that

389
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:15,280
game there's a downloadable content link on the actual main menu there and what's

390
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,880
gonna happen later on once they activate it is you're gonna be able to download

391
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:24,680
new maps new textures etc but that's not available right now so you know because

392
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:29,280
the big community that buys PSPs you know a lot of them are geeks they went

393
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,360
and packet sniffed the web page so they found out how it was connecting or where it was

394
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:40,440
connecting to. And so now all you do in your PSP when you set it up is you actually set

395
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,400
up a proxy server so basically you put an IP address that you want to connect to and

396
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:50,180
it will connect to that certain directory or whatever. And so basically you can make

397
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:54,960
a web page that has a bunch of links on it and like a browser input thing and you can

398
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,920
actually connected to websites that way and I mean this is being covered on

399
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,800
slashdot and gadget a bunch of different websites so you can find out more about

400
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,920
it on there but the new thing that they just started with PSP IRC and that you

401
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:11,200
actually can connect to IRC right now it's only one channel they can connect

402
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,900
to but they've got like a little mini keyboard on there so it's pretty cool so

403
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:20,320
you're gonna see a lot happening with this probably even before e3 but I'm

404
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:25,960
sure they're going to release a browser for it eventually. Now, I've been hearing a lot

405
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,360
of folks that are picking up a PSP. What they're actually doing with it is they're using the

406
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:35,200
memory stick to actually put other things onto their PSP, such as pornography, but in

407
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,640
more practical senses, their MP3 collections and things of this sort, so they can actually

408
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:44,420
use their PSP as kind of like an iPod replacement, basically. A lot of people are now saying,

409
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:49,800
F the iPod, because I can pick up a PSP and play MP3s on the go, correct? Correct, and

410
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:55,800
And hell, if you're spending 250 bucks on a PSV, you might as well fucking get your money's worth, that's what I say.

411
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:03,800
Cause, I mean, honestly, when I was looking for games and stuff, I was like, eh, you know, Wipeout, the other Wipeout games I've really hated.

412
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,800
I mean, I honestly hate Wipeout, and the only reason I bought Wipeout is connected to the internet.

413
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,800
Now, I do, I have been playing Wipeout, and I actually kind of like it now.

414
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,800
But, I don't know, there's a few gripes I have.

415
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:20,240
First off, I don't have any dead pixels, so that's all good.

416
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,200
Second thing, my background's pink.

417
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,160
And now I realize that all the ones I've seen on the internet

418
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,440
have been blue or green.

419
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,840
Well, I read online today, they change with the months.

420
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,880
They change colors.

421
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,400
So that's why it's pink.

422
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,320
I couldn't figure it out.

423
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,320
I thought it was special or something, but apparently not.

424
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:43,680
April is the month of the Cherry Tree Viewing Festival in Japan.

425
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,760
I thought they were just trying to say that, you know, that I got girly PSP.

426
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,000
Anyways, so, um, yeah, I got that in Twisted Metal head-on.

427
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,720
Twisted Metal head-on is exactly like Twisted Metal 2, just a little, you know, graphic upgrade.

428
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:01,040
Now, I like the PSP, the only thing that bugs me is the analog stick.

429
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,280
That thing is so uncomfortable, it just, it doesn't work for me.

430
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,640
I mean, it would've been nice if they had it above the, um, crosspad.

431
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,520
But other than that, it's been pretty cool.

432
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,400
I'm actually hoping to get some more games for it later on.

433
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,920
I've also had fun finding open Wi-Fi networks by my house.

434
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,000
Apparently, there's some neighbors of ours that don't

435
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,080
like to password protect their internet, so I just jumped.

436
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,720
The only problem is I can only jump on it outside because the

437
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,000
signal's not that strong.

438
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,760
So I've been browsing the web out on our porch in the cold

439
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:44,640
and rain, but it's quite fun. So, all you folks out there, be sure to password protect

440
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,240
your internet or else you're going to have people jumping on with their PSPs.

441
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,140
Now, a question I was going to ask you before you were kind of talking about how folks are

442
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:57,120
accessing the PSP networks and everything. What is the probability, since folks are loading

443
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,440
MP3s and videos and stuff, of us, and I know you're kind of looking into this, but I'm

444
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:04,160
kind of curious how far away we are from seeing this, you know how we do our podcasts we do

445
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:09,200
every week where we have the 25 to 30 minute extra show that we do via the podcast. It's

446
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,600
not rehashed material, it's a whole separate thing, so if you want to check that out, just

447
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:17,480
go to orangehouseradio.com, click on it to go. But, what is the possibility of folks

448
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:23,560
being able to download that directly onto their PSP? Do we know yet?

449
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,460
Right now, I haven't been able, I haven't tried downloading anything. I don't think

450
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:33,640
you can. I would imagine it's probably possible you might not be able to download it, maybe

451
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:39,240
you view it. PSP browsing is kind of slow. I mean, it's actually pretty slow. That's

452
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:45,520
the only problem. If you want to get any good, you know, speed out of it, you need to disable

453
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:50,100
the, there's a Wi-Fi power save mode on there, and you need to go under your power save options

454
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:54,340
and actually disable that, and it will browse the internet faster. But, man, if you stream,

455
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:59,400
like, if you try to download some of the other things, it's going to take forever. I mean,

456
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:04,640
I don't think you can do it. Maybe streaming media like our website, or not our website,

457
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:11,400
but our actual like live station they might be able to pick up. But I don't think downloading

458
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:16,240
a podcast would work. The live station might be kind of difficult too because you have

459
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:22,180
to have that extra hurdle of accessing Live 365 and all that. I don't know. I don't know.

460
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:25,000
Hopefully they'll find something because that would be neat to have Orange Lounge on your

461
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,720
PSP I don't know if I had a PSP I think it's pretty cool but we can create a

462
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,740
special edition of our podcast that's like a really really low bit rate or

463
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:36,280
something we didn't think of something you know I haven't tried connecting to

464
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:42,000
live 365 that might be interesting to try out because it's all Java I think so

465
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,480
the only thing that really doesn't work on it is frames and I know if you've

466
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:51,280
visited our website you've seen how on the side there there's a little like a

467
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,840
forum you know topics the most recent topics that have been posted and they

468
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:00,480
kind of scroll up along the PSP they scroll left so it's a little weird you

469
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,800
know I don't think life is if I would work is because the player when you

470
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,480
actually launch the station and I think most you guys are listening to station

471
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:11,640
probably have this it actually pops up in a new window so and I don't think PSP

472
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,840
supports pop-ups at least I hope it doesn't or you know you could get

473
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,800
pop-ups from almost any side out there and suddenly you'll have spyware all

474
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:22,440
over your PSP. But because the player is in a pop-up, I don't know if it's gonna be possible.

475
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:27,360
Now there is the direct access URL you can use, but I think you have, you can only use

476
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:31,840
it like, I don't remember 365's official rules, but I think you can only use it three times

477
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,600
and then they make you log in. I don't remember, it's been a long time since I've looked at

478
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,960
the rules on that, but.

479
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:41,880
I'm sure there'll be a work around for it. Yep, already. Here's the other thing that

480
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:47,680
they do have already that you can do that people are doing, is they call it PSP casting.

481
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:52,000
It's where you do video, and you set it up with RSS, and then you can download the video

482
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,840
straight to your PSP. That's the other thing. But, so, I mean, hey, right now you can download

483
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:04,440
the podcast on your home internet and just load it on there. Take a few minutes, you

484
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:09,200
know. It's probably a lot better anyways. I guess that's something you can do for now.

485
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:14,480
All right, well, I want to wrap this segment up, so get quickly to me and Angel's weekend

486
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,640
my week and my day were pretty pretty good I had actually really really good

487
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:22,840
weekend so I'm just very happy went out with some buddies last night we just

488
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:26,760
kind of went out the club and all that stuff actually played some DDR today at

489
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:30,720
home several different yeah I was showing DDR to somebody who had not

490
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:35,520
seen the Xbox mixes yet so double gasps I got to you know play some ultra mix too

491
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,160
I actually worked out I played some 9s I was working up a sweat or something

492
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:43,640
else that's good exercise other than that you might remember that earlier

493
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,000
this week I don't know if you listen Thursday night show but on Thursday

494
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,640
night's program we were talking about Yoshi's touch and go on the DS which is

495
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:54,640
a game that I picked up earlier this week because I don't want to spend $300

496
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:00,240
on a PSP and I don't want to spend $150 on night style just yet but I want to

497
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,960
buy a game to hold me over until I have more money so I decided I'd go to Game

498
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,200
Stop and I was just randomly gonna buy myself a new DS game well the problem

499
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:12,040
with a Nintendo DS right now although the technology is excellent the DS has

500
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:17,080
a lot of potential. I would say about 1% of the DS potential is actually being used right

501
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:21,120
now because there's what, like 12 games out there for the DS right now? So there's really

502
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:25,580
not a lot. So when I said I wanted to buy a DS game, my choices were pretty limited.

503
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:29,080
So I finally ended up deciding to pick up this game, Yoshi's Touch and Go, which on

504
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:32,520
Thursday night's show I just slammed because I did not like the game at all. I thought

505
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:36,580
it was hard to get into. I thought it was the same, repetitive. But this is the weird

506
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:41,540
thing. I still have not been able to put this game down. And I don't know if it's because

507
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:46,220
it's the only DS game that I haven't worn out yet or what but I've still been

508
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:50,500
playing this game it's very very odd and I like the fact that you can search for

509
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,980
picto chat rooms like I've been just like I was my friend was driving to the

510
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:56,780
club last night I was actually playing Yoshi's touch-and-go in the car searching

511
00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:00,060
for picto chat rooms trying to see if I could pick up like little kids doing

512
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:03,220
picto chat in the backseat of a car so I could hop on there and go you know you

513
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:09,100
suck you know or something but it didn't work so I've been playing Yoshi's touch

514
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:15,100
And I've also been playing a little bit of Final Fantasy XI, but not so much. I'm trying to cut short the eviction.

515
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,100
I didn't play it all this week.

516
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,100
Well, aren't you special?

517
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,100
I need to help me level.

518
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:26,100
Well, you're at the point, though, where you gotta party to level.

519
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:31,100
I do party! I am a party girl! Nobody parties like I do, okay?

520
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:34,100
Alright, sorry. You gonna party like it's level 99?

521
00:44:34,100 --> 00:45:00,100
I found my Chains of Promothea Discs, which means I'm back on the game.

522
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:11,700
Anyway, so that was like, uhh, Thursday I guess, um, Tuesday however, I went to school

523
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:18,900
and went to my class, but only six people showed up, so obviously it got cancelled,

524
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:24,420
and that sucks, so I'm gonna wait till August and take it all over again, but it's all good.

525
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:26,860
I can wait, I am patient.

526
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:36,620
Other than that, I played some DDR this week, yay, met some people over at the place I usually

527
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:44,420
play at that I hadn't seen in a while, so that was cool, and not much yesterday, went

528
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:53,540
out and met some people from a game called there, I've talked about this many times over,

529
00:45:53,540 --> 00:46:01,500
But I actually got to meet the people behind their avatar, so it's cool.

530
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:06,860
I just had a really good weekend, and a really good week.

531
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:11,580
Not too much to complain about, not too much to talk about really.

532
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:12,580
Pretty boring.

533
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:17,980
But hey, at least I can play Final Fantasy XI and a couple other games I've been playing.

534
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:27,540
Half-Life 2, Cough, Hack, and uh, other stuff, so uh, I guess that's it. Oh, I got Ultra

535
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:35,820
Mix 2 this week. Hehehe, we must play. What do you think of the DDR Ultra Mix 2? I don't

536
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:41,980
know why, but uh, my load time sucks. Now, I don't know if that's everyone's cartridge

537
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:47,420
or just mine. I mean, not cartridge, but disc, rather. I don't know if... You know what I've

538
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:52,740
noticed is that booting up DDR Ultramix 2 takes forever but once you finally get

539
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:56,500
in there it's not so bad but it's just the boot up takes a long time it's like

540
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:01,920
trying to play something on the PSP well I actually thought it was me because you

541
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:07,660
know Andrew was like why is taking so long what's going on it's not supposed

542
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:11,580
to be taking this long I'm like oh should we take it back he goes no no I'm

543
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:15,980
like okay you know not he's not giving me a straight answer so I'm like well

544
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:20,300
maybe I'll just ask Rob when I get here tomorrow which I'm doing now so that's

545
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:28,180
cool but I think I do need to get a dual platform pad because it's the converter

546
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:34,220
I'm using is kind of glitchy yuck I figured I'd try the converter first and

547
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:39,940
if that didn't work well I would get a dual platform so here we go I'm gonna

548
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:48,500
have to invest in a dual platform now. Alrighty. What we're gonna do now, let's go to a break,

549
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:52,860
we'll do some break, we're gonna do some new Beatmania 2DX music, like from 10th and 11th

550
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:58,980
style on this break, so we're gonna do some music from that. I have a request. I think

551
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:03,300
I know what you want and it's already in there. That's happy joy stuff. Alright, so we'll

552
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:08,700
get that. What else are we gonna have when we come back? Skypline! We'll open that up,

553
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:12,700
So go to www.orangelandsradio.com, click on interact with us if you have something you want to talk about.

554
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:17,700
We had a request from the chat room to talk about a video game related tour going on this summer.

555
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,700
So we'll talk about that because it's worth mentioning.

556
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:22,700
And other gaming news when we come back.

557
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:26,700
So we will be back after this with more Orange Launch Radio.

558
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:29,700
We're going to start it off with a track from BeatMania 2DX11 style.

559
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,700
This is injection of love

560
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:01,700
I'm so sad to die

561
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:04,700
I can't tell you please

562
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:08,700
I will be playing the other way

563
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:13,700
I'm so sad to die

564
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,700

All she can do is love you more

574

Dont be afraid

605
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:20,740
I know

606
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:22,740
I know

607
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:24,740
I know

608
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:26,740
I know

609
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,740
I know

610
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:33,740
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting

611
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:38,740
as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

612
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:43,740
Um, Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bamani Music and More program. Can we talk about that?

613
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:46,740
No subject will ever be taboo.

614
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:50,740
Well, I was thinking maybe we should move, pump up the volume from Tuesday nights?

615
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,740
Except, of course, the subject that was just under discussion.

616
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:59,740
Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the attack music we play on the station?

617
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:01,740
I collect your fucking head.

618
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:04,740
Just like this fucker here.

619
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:13,740
Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki? The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

620
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:20,740
Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

621
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:25,740
Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

622
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:56,100
And of course, because Jamie had to hear it, Gradius Full Speed by Mr. T in that break

623
00:57:56,100 --> 00:58:01,700
as well, starting it off injection of love.

624
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:04,900
You know we have a little bit of competition going on tonight with Orange Launch Radio.

625
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:10,960
Folks are torn between whether they want to listen to Orange Launch Radio or watch WrestleMania.

626
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:11,960
You know what?

627
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:12,960
Or watch baseball.

628
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:13,960
Guilty, guilty, guilty.

629
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:19,900
Had I had a way to the Bay Area today, I'd be watching WrestleMania.

630
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:27,000
I don't watch wrestling all year anymore, but WrestleMania is like, wow, it's WrestleMania.

631
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,720
Get to see my hot, sweaty men's in their drama.

632
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:30,720
Men's?

633
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:31,720
My men's.

634
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:32,720
You're men's?

635
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,720
What about the women?

636
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:34,720
There's women wrestlers too, right?

637
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:35,720
Don't they get anything?

638
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:36,720
Yeah, but they're all hoochies now.

639
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:37,720
They used to...

640
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:42,280
WrestleMania 19 was the last one that had women that could actually wrestle.

641
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:43,480
Just because of the one with Trish Stratus.

642
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:47,360
I just remember Chyna, because who doesn't remember Chyna, especially with real life

643
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:48,360
and everything.

644
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:52,360
and then got her butt booted from TNA as all washed up.

645
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:56,360
I mean, okay, she's really awesome, and I think if she got her, you know, got her shit together,

646
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:00,360
she'd be all, you know, really cool, but

647
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:04,360
her time's passed unless she can grab it again.

648
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:08,360
It's just not the same, and we need, we need more roid girls.

649
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:12,360
Speaking of surreal life, have you heard about the new season of surreal life?

650
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:16,360
I mock reality TV.

651
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:18,660
Come on, didn't you watch the previous one a little bit?

652
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:19,160
No.

653
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:19,960
Okay, well...

654
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:20,460
I...

655
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:20,960
You should.

656
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,460
It had China in it, and Mini-Me.

657
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:25,460
I watched the one where they were ranting cattle.

658
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:27,360
Okay, there you go. So you watched at least one episode.

659
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,660
So you kinda know what the show's about.

660
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:32,360
And I did watch one episode before the first episode,

661
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,760
because I got to see Flava Flav.

662
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:36,360
Okay, so you watched, like, season three, or two or three.

663
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:36,960
I don't remember what it was.

664
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:37,960
I watched episodes.

665
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:38,560
Okay.

666
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:39,760
I can count them on one hand.

667
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:41,760
Well, the new season's gonna be good,

668
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,160
because they're gonna have Amorosa, who now...

669
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,360
Oh, I know you're happy.

670
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:46,560
Wasn't she your hero?

671
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:49,200
I loved that woman. She was on The Apprentice.

672
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,280
And I didn't love her because like I actually

673
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,360
thought she was cool, but I loved to hate her.

674
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:59,040
No, I don't think... Anyway.

675
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,960
Also what I love is

676
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:05,600
Balke from Perfect Strangers is supposed to be on surreal life five and that is

677
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:06,640
just so cool to me.

678
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:10,720
Because what the heck has Balke done since Perfect Strangers?

679
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:14,400
B movie. He's in a B movie, I have it. I'm gonna

680
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,080
I'll be bringing it home soon, actually.

681
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:20,160
He needs to do Old Navy commercials now, just like the other washed-up actors.

682
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:25,520
Well, either you, you know, either you, uh, do Old Navy commercials or you, you know,

683
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:26,800
join this real-life cast.

684
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,240
What happened to the other guy that was on Perfect Strangers?

685
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,000
They said bring back Perfect Strangers.

686
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,600
That's not a bad, that's not a bad idea.

687
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,120
I mean, they're not doing anything.

688
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,800
I mean, no one knows them for anything.

689
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:39,520
Bring it back.

690
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:41,200
I mean, it can't be worse than Joey.

691
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:46,200
All right. Julie, get your butt over here and say hi.

692
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:51,200
Oh, we have a special guest that just came in studio. Get your butt over. Has Julie ever been on the show before?

693
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:56,200
She's as webcam shy as I am. No, Julie hasn't been on the show before.

694
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:01,200
Well, hi, Julie. Say hello. Hi, audience.

695
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:06,200
This is Julie, also known on the web, the big internet monster as

696
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:13,080
19 who never updates her live journal except once every six months. They can't

697
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:17,800
hear what you say if you don't talk into the microphone as you know.

698
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:23,800
It's been about nine months. I'm horrible. Here's Rob. PSO addict. Oh PSO is a good

699
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,960
game though. Actually somebody in chat room was just asking me about that. The

700
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:31,080
people in chat were like the people in the people in chat were asking me about

701
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:36,120
PSO you know saying you know does anybody actually play PSO anymore?

702
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:40,120
And I'm like, well, actually, yeah, if you go on Xbox, you can get shit-talked by so many people.

703
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,120
I play some TSOs sometimes.

704
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:43,120
Once in a while.

705
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:45,120
Julie still needs to give me my Oppa Oppa.

706
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:50,120
Alright, uh, let's see, moving on.

707
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:56,120
That was enough pop culture news. Let's talk about some actual Bomani news going on out there in the scene.

708
01:01:56,120 --> 01:02:04,120
Actually, surprisingly not a whole heck of a lot, with the exception of some follow-up to the earlier announcement about 2DX Happy Sky.

709
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:08,900
you know you hear this 2d x12 style is gonna be called happy sky happy happy

710
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:16,420
happy brain twitch I know I know some very interesting things they are they

711
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:21,940
are just changing things upside down now all this you know is kind of coming off

712
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:27,280
test location data so it could be subject to change high speed is going to

713
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,700
be in there now but it's going to be in halves as well like so you can play you

714
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:33,580
know one speed two speed you could kind of do that before but now you can have

715
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:41,100
half 1.5 2.5 I think that's kind of cool they're supposed to be also on hidden

716
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:48,620
plus and sudden plus available in there s random mode as well the sudden plus

717
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:53,780
and hidden plus they're also they have adjustable hidden sudden areas so where

718
01:02:53,780 --> 01:03:00,180
you can pretty much decide where the notes appear or they disappear etc now

719
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:04,900
Now here's the other very interesting thing, instead of light, normal, another, now it's

720
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:08,260
going to be normal, hyper, another.

721
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:12,340
And this being probably, I think, some of the biggest news, the ratings are all changing

722
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:15,220
because now anothers are going to be ranked.

723
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:19,400
So now instead of being like one through eight with flashing eights, which is the way it

724
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:24,180
is now, for a lot of folks that are on home versions, you might only have seen one through

725
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:28,420
seven with flashing sevens, but in the arcades now it's one through eight with flashing eights.

726
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:36,020
Now it's going to be 1 through 12, and one of the reported level 12 songs, V-Another,

727
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:38,420
which you know, if you've ever seen V-Another, not a problem.

728
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:41,900
Yeah, and I would think that Sakura would be up there.

729
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:43,100
Oh, I don't know.

730
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:47,580
They're saying right now that that is the only level 12 one.

731
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:54,040
I think that as far as the DJ Lisu videos, that was the only one he had to do with using

732
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:57,040
two hands.

733
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:59,920
Some scary stuff.

734
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:04,320
And then some pictures are available if you visit our website, www.orangelandrado.com.

735
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:07,900
And of course, some of the news, and I think we might have touched on this a little bit

736
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:13,480
last week, I don't remember, but there is a crossover artist showing up from DDR Ultra

737
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:15,480
Mix 2.

738
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:18,200
Big idea, who did the song Toe Jam?

739
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:24,640
Toe Jam is going to be in Happy Sky, which is really weird that a USA artist is crossing

740
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:25,640
over into 2DX.

741
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:32,880
it's kind of neat though. Well, there's good talent all over the world. There is, but when

742
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:39,240
I think of all the possible DDR songs in history that were created for DDR that should cross

743
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:44,400
over into Beatmania 2DX, ToeJam isn't really the first one that comes to my mind. It's

744
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:51,920
not a bad start, just, you know, it could be better. Well, they've gotten European artists.

745
01:04:51,920 --> 01:05:00,160
I guess that's true. Some other artists coming back as well. Twin Amadeus,

746
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:04,640
Platonic X, a lot of folks you know. Ryu of course going to be back. Ryu kind of

747
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:08,200
just started all of a sudden showing up all the time. Terra, all those folks. So

748
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:13,240
check that out. That will be location testing currently and hopefully coming

749
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:20,760
to an arcade near you pretty soon. So I guess that's pretty much the biggest

750
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:24,660
is going on right now. I can think of some local Bomani news going on. I want to touch

751
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:29,080
on this and then we'll open up the spotlight. In Sacramento, two things, jack and shit.

752
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:33,000
Well actually no, there's a pretty big story going on right now. But it's at an arcade

753
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:38,840
we don't really go to a whole lot, Roseville Golf Land. Now, understandably we are an international

754
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:42,400
radio program, so we have folks that listen all over, but sometimes we talk about our

755
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:46,800
neck of the woods, which is Sacramento. And we have this arcade here, it's a beautiful

756
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:51,900
It's a two story, huge arcade with a fancy water park.

757
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:52,900
It's ghetto.

758
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:53,900
It's ghetto as hell.

759
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:58,500
Because parents drop their children off there and just leave them there to wreak havoc on

760
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,900
the whole place and so they break machines and everything.

761
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:07,740
Well here's the great news, Roseville Golfland got Guitar Freaks and Drummania V, the brand

762
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:09,540
new ones.

763
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:10,820
I have a reason to go again.

764
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:12,300
Already the hi-hat is broken.

765
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:18,380
Okay, why does that crap not surprise me whatsoever?

766
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:22,020
And the green button on the left guitar is broken as well.

767
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:25,640
At least some woman didn't try to change her baby's diaper on it like on the little keyboard

768
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:26,640
mania.

769
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:27,640
Although...

770
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,380
Probably would have if there was a platform to do so.

771
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:33,260
Yeah, I caught somebody doing that one.

772
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:34,740
So you know, that's great.

773
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:38,820
We're all excited because we're getting the new Guitar Freaks Drummania V and it's very

774
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:41,380
interesting because I was talking to one of our listeners before the show who lives in

775
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:45,660
Vegas and they're all excited because they just got 2DX red and guitar freaks

776
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:50,100
and drum mania V and I'm like yeah we got it too except you know 2DX red

777
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:53,700
doesn't work it's just a frame without a monitor right now and guitar freaks

778
01:06:53,700 --> 01:07:00,420
drum mania V both broken haha you know what they should let me run

779
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:07,380
gothland first of all there would be absolutely none of those retards that

780
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:11,820
piss me off allowed. Would there actually be a sign on the door that says no retards

781
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:16,820
that piss me off? Exactly. And I'll have a list of the people that I've actually had

782
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:23,160
kicked out so that they would know specifically that they are not allowed in. And then I would

783
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:28,500
have to have some type of scanning device I think. Maybe, maybe we would be like the,

784
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:34,340
you remember the Studio 54? Yes, I do remember, yes. We would be the Studio 54 of the 21st

785
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:38,820
I like that idea. Except with no cocaine bar in the back room.

786
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:42,420
How about a heroin bar? Can we have that instead?

787
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:45,940
Okay, we can have heroin, but we'll have to move to the Netherlands.

788
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:51,220
Okay, so I just want to kind of catch you up on that, that, you know, we're all

789
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:53,900
excited to have Guitar Freaks and Drummania V in town,

790
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:58,260
and I would give you my full review, however, shit's broken,

791
01:07:58,260 --> 01:08:03,580
so I can't, so sorry guys. Maybe we'll go take some pictures of the broken stuff, we'll see.

792
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:07,500
Anyway, we are going to open up the Skype line if you guys want to call in and interact

793
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,500
with our program.

794
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:13,460
You have something you want to comment on, such as possibly the new 2DX Happy Sky, something

795
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:15,140
that's going on in your neck of the woods.

796
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:19,300
I know there were a couple DDR tournaments that went on pretty recently.

797
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:20,300
We'll open up the Skype line.

798
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:22,260
In fact, we're already getting a call, so let's go to it.

799
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:24,180
Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

800
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:29,500
Emerging from the shadows of Bimani style, here's your resident 2DX bastard, Darkline

801
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:30,500
XVI.

802
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:31,500
Hey, Sky, sit here.

803
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:33,060
Wow, you've got quite a...

804
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:37,740
I should get a fanfare to play when he introduces a doo-doo-doo-doo!

805
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:39,660
Alright, what's on your mind, buddy?

806
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:41,140
Well, yeah, you...

807
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:43,120
and yeah, I already told you that uh...

808
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:48,180
Vegas has officially gone VN Red. We have GITADORA VN and 2DX Red

809
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:51,740
as of last Thursday. Yeah, so you were the person I was mentioning a little bit earlier.

810
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:54,100
Tell me about going on... what's going on in Vegas.

811
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:57,180
Now, did you hear what I was just saying about Roseville Golf Lands got all that

812
01:08:57,180 --> 01:08:59,340
too, except none of it works? Yeah, okay.

813
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:01,100
Yeah, we're lucky here.

814
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:09,600
Oh, and about 2DX12, Happy Sky, I have to mention to you the songs that are 12 stars on single.

815
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:13,300
Oh, is there more than just V another? I only had heard of V another. What else is there?

816
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:26,600
Uh, there's Ace, Double Ace, Colors Radio Edit, Time, Genocide, Gigadelic, Innocent Walls, Moon Child, One More Lovely, Please Don't Go,

817
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:35,000
And Piano Kyousou Kyoku Daichi-ban Sasori, AKA PF Conchato Achiares, Sakura, and...

818
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,900
Ah, so Sakura is? It's 12.

819
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:40,800
I told you. Didn't I tell you?

820
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,700
And Setsugetaka.

821
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:48,900
So there are quite a few Anothers. Okay, that's good. Good difficulty there for the folks that can actually do that stuff.

822
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:50,100
More power to you.

823
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:54,400
I'm lucky if I can pass an 8, especially considering I haven't played in quite some time.

824
01:09:54,400 --> 01:10:06,400
But I'm really excited about the Anothers actually having rankings now, because, you know, I follow 2DX, but I'm not, like, super obsessed, like, I don't study note charts, like, I have friends that do this, and that's cool.

825
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,400
I don't, you know, that's cool if that's what they're into.

826
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:21,400
But, like, if I'm gonna play an Another, I wanna instantly be able to know which Another is in my range, because you know how, like, Holic was, like, a 6, but the Another for Holic is frickin' insane?

827
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:27,000
Like you know, so I want to know about where the another stand whereas like dual control another from what I remember

828
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,120
It was not that much harder than the original. So

829
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:31,760
It's just you know, I want to know where they stand on the scale

830
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,480
So that's going to be very helpful to somebody like me. So I'm excited about that

831
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:40,440
Yeah, and then the singles for 11 stars are it's already listed here on this website

832
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:47,020

839
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:33,060
another is not a 12, it's an 11? Well, I guess I could see that though. Compared to like

840
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:38,980
Moon Child another, I guess I could see that. Alright. So what else is going on besides

841
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:46,260
that 2DX update. I just sent you a private message about the videos for the location

842

846
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:11,980
at all in some of this? It's very clear! Oh good! The first video that I checked out is

847
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:18,980
100% Minimoog by Sota Fujimori. Oh okay, cool. How's the song sound? It's really fast. It's

848
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:25,900
at 252 BPM. Well I'll have to check that out a little later. If it's clear enough, maybe

849
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:31,380
we'll play some on the show a little later. It's really clear. Very cool. Alright. Anything

850
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:35,460
else you want to share with us tonight, Ziggy? Well, last thing I want to say is quit calling

851
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:42,420
by its styles you always keep on calling 11 styles i know but it's just i i i don't know how to

852
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:48,260
explain it it's just uh it's like a style thing it's just yeah it's like you know i'm the 10th

853
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:52,820
style and then it just seems logical the next 2dx because they haven't changed the hardware or

854
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:57,460
anything they've only changed they really haven't changed much than what they changed going from

855
01:12:57,460 --> 01:13:03,700
fifth to sixth and sixth to seventh and so on so yeah i just naturally called 11 i know it's red

856
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:08,900
and happy sky but seriously do you expect me to call this new 2dx happy sky and keep a straight face

857
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:14,900
i know yeah everybody can't tell you're gonna call it 12 style yeah and speaking of 12 star

858
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:23,860
there is such a song called 12 style huh there's a in in happy sky there's gonna be a song called 12

859
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:32,180
style yeah that's pretty cool so maybe it's okay then that i call it 12 style yeah all right all

860
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:35,180
Alright, well thank you for the pronunciation update, I appreciate it.

861
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:39,180
Not so much pronunciation, but you know, like referring to.

862
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:42,180
I gotta mention the videos on the Sinon subs that they have.

863
01:13:42,180 --> 01:13:48,180
The first one is Captivate Joka, which means purify.

864
01:13:48,180 --> 01:13:52,180
Second video they have is Gekko, which is moonlight.

865
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:54,180
And then the third one is Green Eyes.

866
01:13:54,180 --> 01:14:01,180
And then the last one is the video that I mentioned is 100% Minimoog.

867
01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:04,020
I'm gonna have to check that out because I want to hear some of those songs. I want to hear what they sound like

868
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:10,140
So I'll definitely be looking at that. Yeah. All right. All right. Well, thanks for the call bud. You have a good one later

869
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:12,140
All right later

870
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:16,860
Resident 2dx bastard Siggy we always like hearing from him. Let's go to another call

871
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:19,620
Hello, you are on orange launch radio

872
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:23,660
Greetings is Ron Masato me one more time. How you guys doing? Good. How are you doing?

873
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:27,760
Somewhat tired. I want you to know that I am a devoted fan of the show

874
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:33,760
I went to Boston this weekend, and I arranged my trip so I could come back in time to catch the show.

875
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:38,760
That's hardcore. Yes, it is. That's very hardcore. You didn't have to do that for us.

876
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:43,760
I mean, heck, if I was going to Boston, I wouldn't have rearranged my trip to come back for this show.

877
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:48,760
But we adore you for it. You are awesome and fabulous. Yes, you are awesome and fabulous.

878
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:53,760
Well, I do try. Alright, right on. What else is on your mind? What's been going on in your game and world this week?

879
01:14:53,760 --> 01:15:01,760
Oh, not much. I've been playing some of my old PS2 games recently. Right now I'm trying to work through Musashi. I'm in love with it.

880
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:05,760
Oh, the brand new one on PlayStation?

881
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,760
Yeah, the new one on PS2.

882
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:08,760
Right on.

883
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:16,760
I've been playing through Anamusha 2. I'm off for the next three days. I have stacks of anime box sets I have to plow through.

884
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:21,760
And I just picked up the season box set to 21 Jump Street.

885
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:25,760
Hahaha, that's awesome. I try.

886
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:29,760
I'm surprised you're not a big 21 Jump Street fan, DarkSakura. 21 Jump Street?

887
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:33,760
I watched it a bit when it came on TV, but I wasn't

888
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:37,760
so not into Johnny Depp at the time. It was all River Phoenix.

889
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:41,760
Okay, alright. But maybe now you'd have more respect for it? I don't know.

890
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:45,760
Not really. Okay, sorry.

891
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:49,760
Oh, by the way, guess what, Ranma. Yeah, what's up?

well i don't want to talk to you

900
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:28,320
but let me add to that

901
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:31,840
you have to cost a little child where he's a she got to you know i've been

902
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:36,420
working and working on that and keep saying that i'll do it and i never do

01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:40,600

906
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:48,940
there's one on fans view back in the day and then there was one of me as mad

907
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:51,260

908
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:55,020

909
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:57,020
i'll see if i have it somewhere

910
01:16:57,020 --> 01:17:02,020
it's horrible, it was like sixty pounds heavier in it

911
01:17:02,020 --> 01:17:04,280
but you're probably still a cop anyway

912
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:07,280
that is so sweet

913
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,380
oh fluster, eager fluster

914
01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:12,940
yeah she's already living on another planet tonight we don't need to yell

915
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:14,940
Hey, I am a celebrity!

916
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:16,940
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

917
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:18,940
You just watch it.

918
01:17:18,940 --> 01:17:21,940
Just for that, I'll eat a bag of M&M's just for you.

919
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:23,940
Aww.

920
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:27,940
Alright, any other ass you want to kiss while you're on the line here, Ronma?

921
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:32,940
I love you, Sky, because you're still a devoted fan of the DS.

922
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:35,940
I am. I have faith in the DS. Right now, it's very-

923
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:37,940
Well, I appreciate that. Thank you, Rob.

924
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:41,940
Not that DS.

925
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:44,500
Every time somebody says DS, Dark Soccer goes, hee hee, that's me.

926
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:45,980
Well, why wouldn't they think about me?

927
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:46,980
I know.

928
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:50,140
But no, it's hard for me to be a fan of the DS right now, because we're in a little bit

929
01:17:50,140 --> 01:17:53,320
of the slump, but I am still a fan of the DS.

930
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:58,940
You know, and I think it's okay for me to say I am a fan of both the DS and the PSP.

931
01:17:58,940 --> 01:17:59,940
There's nothing wrong with that.

932
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:00,940
I like them both.

933
01:18:00,940 --> 01:18:01,940
I agree.

934
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:06,220
I'm going to buy a PSP once Sony fixes all the kinks, and I'll wait for a second or third

935
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:07,220
generation unit.

936
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:11,060
I'm just not a fan of the price of the PSP, but I'll get over it.

937
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:14,380
I'll get over it eventually.

938
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:18,660
Two hundred and fifty bucks please. We couldn't even buy them when they came out.

939
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:22,420
If it came with Luminous packed in, that would so be worth it.

940
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:24,100
We'll see.

941
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:26,400
Alright, well I'm going to let you go. Have a good one, buddy.

942
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,780
You too. Enjoy the rest of the week. Thank you. Have a good...

943
01:18:28,780 --> 01:18:31,820
Thanks for calling. Have a good week. Bye.

944
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:35,660
Let's see if we can get in one more call at least. Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

945
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:39,860
Hey, SSJ100 Matt here. Hello, SSJ100 Matt. What's on your mind?

946
01:18:39,860 --> 01:18:45,120
nothing um... i guess i was going to be true punches can talk about the

947
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:46,560
dear friends uh...

948
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:49,520
car yeah that's right you would want to send that to me yes i was going to i was

949
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:52,260
gonna make a mention of this after the statement but that's okay

950
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:56,120
all right well what what what side going on with the dear friends with the snooze

951
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:57,960
you found out about your friends

952
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:02,220
or just uh... fan about this earlier uh... this weekend um...

953
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:06,060
it turns out that the dear friends uh... fall fancy constant coming to the east

954
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:07,480
coast

955
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:12,080
So, and like we're not talking Chicago, which to some of us in California, Chicago counts

956
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:15,200
as East Coast, but not really to the rest of America.

957
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:20,360
So now it's actually going to be in an East Coast state, so some of you guys are going

958
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:21,360
to be able to catch this.

959
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:26,080
So, you have some of the details you want to tell our listeners?

960
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:28,960
They're going to kind of not be like in the major cities, they're going to kind of be

961
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:32,300
in like corners of the East Coast.

962
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:36,520
First one is going to be on May 20th in Hartford, Connecticut.

963
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:39,880
on. I have friends who live in Connecticut. They'll be happy about that information.

964
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:46,000
Yeah, and in June 24th and the 25th Atlanta, Georgia is going to have it.

965
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:53,760
Okay, so some southeast fun there, okay. And then for some reason they put in San

966
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:59,840
Diego for East Coast touring, but you know. San Diego, North Carolina! No, it's

967
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:05,040
San Diego, California is getting another show, so there you go. So for those of you

968
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:09,640
that maybe missed out on the previous L.A. show. Here's your chance. You can go to San Diego.

969
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:12,240
That's going to be July 14th and then

970
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:16,800
July 23rd and the 24th, they're going to have it in Detroit, so...

971
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:19,880
Very cool. Try not to get shot at that concert, by the way.

972
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:23,040
Well, I won't go to that one. I'll go to the Hartford one. Okay, very cool.

973
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,400
I have friends in Connecticut who would be interested in going.

974
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:28,680
If I had time off work, I would go, but I won't.

975
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:29,560
And the money.

976
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:31,920
And money, yeah. Absolutely.

977
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:35,200
I'm looking forward, though, to the More Friends concert that's going to be happening in L.A.

978
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:38,400
I do have tickets, so I'm very excited about that, so we'll see what happens.

979
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:42,240
But... yep, um...

980
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:45,440
Ad here, I'm waiting for In The Groove to finally come.

981
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:50,000
I mean, it's been sitting in a DDR 4th Mix case for about two months.

982
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:54,160
And this is not working, or...? No, they just had...

983
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:58,160
they have, like, the logo for In The Groove and everything on it,

984
01:20:58,160 --> 01:21:01,520
and they still just have 4th Mix playing on it.

985
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:04,720
somebody's too lazy to get in there and switch it over

986
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:08,120
I mean it's Goughland, you guys have a good time

987
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:11,360
okay, okay, wait I didn't know Goughland existed on the east coast

988
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:15,600
No, it's Arizona, no, I'm from the east coast but I'm going to school in Arizona

989
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:18,600
gotcha, okay I'm sorry, okay gotcha, huh

990
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:23,360
that's kinda, okay, so they've got in the groove just sitting there waiting to go

991
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:24,320
okay well

992
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:27,800
in the groove you know it's, for me there's good things about it

993
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:30,480
there's bad things about it, I've said this just about every week

994
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:37,480
I find it very interesting what's going on on The Freak right now, over on DDR Freak, about their April Fools post.

995
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:45,480
Just, they've turned into these huge In The Groove vs DDR messes, and I'm just kinda like, can't we all just get along?

996
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:51,480
You know, there's things to like and things to not like about both games. Everybody can improve a little bit.

997
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:58,480
I just, I really don't like that attitude, though, when folks, you know, I guess this is the one thing I will say kind of against In The Groove,

998
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:03,080
but it's not really the game itself so much as the fan base, but I really hate it when

999
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:10,040
people come on and go, ah, DDR's dead, time to move on. Well, okay, didn't they just release

1000
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:14,820
a press release in January that said DDR sold a million copies? Yeah, DDR is like really

1001
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:20,440
dead. Maybe DDR is dead in the arcades, but that's only because, you know, Konami's stupid,

1002
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:25,360
for lack of a better term. But as far as the home releases go, DDR is far from dead. And

1003
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:31,040
And I firmly believe that DDR will continue to own In the Groove on the home releases.

1004
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:35,340
But In the Groove is going to pick up the arcade stuff if DDR doesn't do anything.

1005
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:39,400
So it's going to be interesting.

1006
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:43,280
I'm just anxious to try it, that's it, because everyone's talking about it.

1007
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:47,160
I'm just wondering if the hype's what it is.

1008
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:52,320
You have to let us know what you think once you get a chance to try it out.

1009
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:56,320
Yep, I'm watching the Yankee game and listening to you guys, so...

1010
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:58,320
All right, sounds good.

1011
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:02,320
All right, well enjoy the game, and I guess we'll talk to you another time, all right?

1012
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:03,320
Yep, take it easy.

1013
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:05,320
All right, have a good one. Bye-bye.

1014
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:08,320
Watching the game, having a bud.

1015
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:09,320
Sitting back.

1016
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:10,320
Wasabi!

1017
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:12,320
Smoking a bud. No, I'm kidding.

1018
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:15,320
All right.

1019
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:17,320
Wasabi!

1020
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:22,320
Pretty much the sushi restaurant version of What's Up last night.

1021
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:24,320
Oh, really?

1022
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:25,600
Yeah.

1023
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:28,280
Was that on the internet for download?

1024
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:33,580
We were, when I was at Iguana Girls last night, we were going through some of her old discs

1025
01:23:33,580 --> 01:23:37,800
and it was one of the things on there too along with Tokyo Breakfast.

1026
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:44,840
Tokyo Breakfast is like a one punchline joke, but it's still kind of amusing.

1027
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:52,000
the edited picture of Quasimodo now that was posted on iguana girls journal

1028
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:59,400
earlier which made me laugh because that was an old joke yeah but funny nobody

1029
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:03,680
knows what the hell we're talking about so forget it let's just move on to we're

We are facing the fire together

If we don't move, I'll be apart

1044
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:46,680
Save your tears for the day

1045
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:50,680
When nothing is far behind

1046
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:53,680
On your knees, how do you feel?

1047
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:56,680
Fear of sound and light

1048
01:25:56,680 --> 01:26:03,680
Set your fears, take your place, save them for the judgment's sake

1049
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:11,680
Let them dream, follow me, and to make the sacrifice

1050
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:16,680
Will you rise or fall?

1051
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:33,040
Okay, that was a clip of song number one, that was Yoko Kanno with Rise.

1052
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:38,920
Alright, we're gonna go into my song for tonight's cage match, and what we're gonna do tonight

1053
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:44,020
is um I've decided that I'm going to declare war on the listeners because I'm

1054
01:27:44,020 --> 01:27:48,980
a little pissed off at how poorly received Kelly Clarkson was last week so

1055
01:27:48,980 --> 01:27:58,980
I've decided screw you guys I'm putting in Britney Spears song number two for me

1056
01:27:58,980 --> 01:28:05,580
to you with love Britney Spears with every time the Valentine remix

1057
01:28:28,980 --> 01:28:38,980
But for me, strength is when I'll scroll

1058
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:42,980
Why can't we all fall asleep?

1059
01:28:42,980 --> 01:28:48,980
Learning from the fact that I fall without my wings

1060
01:28:48,980 --> 01:28:53,980
I feel so small, cause I need you baby

1061
01:28:53,980 --> 01:28:55,980
You're a human, I see

1062
01:28:55,980 --> 01:28:57,980
You've ruined my dreams

1063
01:28:57,980 --> 01:29:01,980
I see your face is haunting me

1064
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:04,980
I guess I need you baby

1065
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:06,980
Baby

1066
01:29:06,980 --> 01:29:08,980
Baby

01:29:21,980 --> 01:29:29,980
I make believe that you are here

1069

Ain't no mistake, I be clear

1070
01:29:36,980 --> 01:29:39,980
What have I done?

1071
01:29:39,980 --> 01:29:44,980
You seem to know what we need

1072
01:29:44,980 --> 01:29:46,980
Every time you try

1073
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:49,980

I may have made a break Please look at me

1079
01:30:16,980 --> 01:30:20,980
My weakness calls your face

1080
01:30:20,980 --> 01:30:27,980
And my soul falls so free

1081
01:30:27,980 --> 01:30:29,980
And every thunderstorm

1082
01:30:29,980 --> 01:30:33,980
Just like I fall without my wings

01:30:35,980 --> 01:30:42,980
I guess I need you, baby, baby

01:30:42,980 --> 01:30:44,980
And let it don't miss me

You and my dream, I see your face, you're haunting me

1087
01:30:50,620 --> 01:30:53,740
I guess I need you, baby

1088
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:59,480
And every time I try, I fall without my wings

1089
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:01,680
I feel so small

1090
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:04,680
I guess I need you, baby

1091
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:12,400
And every time I see, you and my dream, I see your face, you're haunting me

1092
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:15,400
And I can't help me do it again

1093
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:21,400
I may have made a break, break, break

1094
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,400
Minus 57

1095
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:47,640
Because it's Britney Spears. I don't know. The music was okay. It was just like, hi, I'm cookie cutter pop, and

1096
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:50,680
it made me feel nauseous.

1097
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:58,160
So much that not even a coconut cream pie would bring back my appetite. I'm sorry, Rob. That was...

1098
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:01,780
That's all right. I'm not going to take it personally tonight. Just awful. All right.

1099
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:08,060
beyond awful all right Julie right this thing negative 57 from Dark Sakura let

1100
01:32:08,060 --> 01:32:11,500
me go to Loki then we'll get to Julie Loki you know that didn't even really

1101
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:15,620
sound like Britney Spears to me I I don't I don't know it just didn't sound

1102
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:21,920
like it to me but I hate her because she ruined my prerogative so amen you know

1103
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:27,460
she gets a minus one I'm not gonna go as far as 57 cuz that's just ridiculous all

1104
01:32:27,460 --> 01:32:31,660
right Julie I go with minus 58 I just had to be the word given her the lowest

1105
01:32:31,660 --> 01:32:45,620
score of all all right fair enough angel no no you ruined my something or others

1106
01:32:45,620 --> 01:32:57,620
God negative infinity Oh Loki's gonna change his vote my vote is going to be

1107
01:32:57,620 --> 01:33:06,740
158 plus infinity so it's an even zero so that song shut up all right um me

1108
01:33:06,740 --> 01:33:10,380
personally I will be the only one to give it a positive score obviously I'm

1109
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:15,100
the one to put that in there I give that song a seven because you know it's not

1110
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:20,980
that bad. It's a dance remix and like Loki said, it barely sounds like Britney at all.

1111
01:33:20,980 --> 01:33:26,820
And you know what, you guys earned it. Taints of evil, Rob, taints of evil. You earned it.

1112
01:33:26,820 --> 01:33:31,540
And you know what, it was worth it alone for the chat room's reaction, honestly. I should

1113
01:33:31,540 --> 01:33:39,540
do that more often, thank you for the encouragement. Alright, let's get into song number 3. Loki.

1114
01:33:39,540 --> 01:34:09,520
Okay, um, now this song, I made it for a couple reasons. One, uh, well, first off, the song I made, okay, um, this is, basically, I found this Max remix on Bamani Style by this guy named DJ Pato, he's like some Spanish guy, and he really sucks at making remixes, and he made this song called Max Extension, which is retarded, but it has this really cool, um, song in the background in it, and I was like, you know, hey, that'd be a pretty cool song to make a Max remix out of, so that's what I did.

1115
01:34:09,540 --> 01:34:23,540
So, um, adding to my next installment of, you know, the Legend of Trance series, um, this is also, this was supposed to be because my original thought for the, uh, April Fool's joke was going to be Max 300 radio and this was going to debut at the end.

1116
01:34:23,540 --> 01:34:36,540
Well, that didn't happen, so, um, and it's, well, this would, this song would be called Legend of Techno, but that's just retarded, and since I already have, you know, Legend of Trance and Legend of Trance 2004, this is Legend of Trance 2005,

1117
01:34:36,540 --> 01:34:43,540
with the new synonym, Maximum GX, and you know, the song is remixed from F-Zero GX, so, enjoy!

1118
01:34:44,540 --> 01:34:46,540
Here it is, Loki's putting in...

1119
01:34:47,540 --> 01:34:50,540
And I know you guys hate Max remixes, but, lives.

1120
01:34:50,540 --> 01:34:56,940
All right, here it is. Loki is putting in his own creation. It's a Max remix. It's

1121
01:34:56,940 --> 01:35:03,940
Maximum GX with Legend of Trance 2005. Here it is, song number three.

1122
01:37:26,940 --> 01:37:45,220
Song number three, Legend of Trance 2005.

1123
01:37:45,220 --> 01:37:48,860
Let's see what they thought of it, Dark Sakura.

1124
01:37:48,860 --> 01:37:51,700
My head hurts.

1125
01:37:51,700 --> 01:37:52,700
Okay.

1126
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:57,380
Okay, um, it was, I'm sorry, it was Max.

1127
01:37:57,380 --> 01:37:59,340
It made my head hurt.

1128
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:01,580
I twitched.

1129
01:38:01,580 --> 01:38:05,380
But it's not Britney Spears, so it gets a seven.

1130
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:07,900
Alright, Loki.

1131
01:38:07,900 --> 01:38:09,140
It's okay.

1132
01:38:09,140 --> 01:38:10,980
I, I tried.

1133
01:38:10,980 --> 01:38:14,860
I really don't care, just, just gonna play the song later anyways, so...

1134
01:38:14,860 --> 01:38:18,820
It gets a nine, because I made it.

1135
01:38:18,820 --> 01:38:24,020
julie got a mic, can julie give it a rank there?

1136
01:38:24,020 --> 01:38:26,780
here comes julie

1137
01:38:26,780 --> 01:38:29,340
i give that song

1138
01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:31,980
a two, i really wasn't paying much attention though, i'm sorry

1139
01:38:31,980 --> 01:38:34,060
alright, that's alright

1140
01:38:34,060 --> 01:38:37,180
uh... i give it

1141
01:38:37,180 --> 01:38:41,140
i don't know i'm torn because it's a good remix there's a lot of stuff

1142
01:38:41,140 --> 01:38:42,760
going on with it but

1143
01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:47,380
i fucking can't take max anymore i really really cannot take max anymore

1144
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:53,520
I'm done I'm sorry Loki I'm so done with that song so like I would normally give

1145
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:57,220
it like a nine but I'm taking three points off because it's a max remix so

1146
01:38:57,220 --> 01:39:04,180
it gets six angel by the way I'd like to give the whole initial D soundtrack a

1147
01:39:04,180 --> 01:39:12,740
big fat zero because you're a beat sucks ass now now don't get angry just because

1148
01:39:12,740 --> 01:39:19,740
you to enter to max remix angel good beats and stuff in there um but it's max and i'm

1149
01:39:20,980 --> 01:39:27,980
not i don't know i just i can't deal with regular max or whatever so uh i'll be nice

1150
01:39:29,220 --> 01:39:35,700
and give it a seven you know if you wanted to make a good mix you could do like legend

1151
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:41,700
of butt or something i love i love the fact that three of us said it's a good remix but

1152
01:39:41,700 --> 01:39:49,020
it's max you know you people you suck I mean honestly yeah it's been overdone

1153
01:39:49,020 --> 01:39:52,580
but that's because it's a hard song and people like remixing it oh actually

1154
01:39:52,580 --> 01:39:56,660
people like putting other things on top of it and calling it a remix or speeding

1155
01:39:56,660 --> 01:40:01,020
it up or reversing it or god knows what else I just the only reason I made this

1156
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:04,780
song is because that song by DJ pedo sucked and I thought I could make it

1157
01:40:04,780 --> 01:40:09,340
better and I did whether it be trust me you want you want to hear the original

1158
01:40:09,340 --> 01:40:15,580
the original sucked ass okay let me just go that far i have no doubt you made a better

1159
01:40:15,580 --> 01:40:22,700
remix than this other guy but i want max i want you know what you know what we should do i i want

1160
01:40:22,700 --> 01:40:28,540
to get dj paranoia on the show and i think we could arrange it and i want him to say on air

1161
01:40:28,540 --> 01:40:33,260
that they will ban max remixes from the stepmania catalog i don't know what we have to do to him to

1162
01:40:33,260 --> 01:40:37,500
get him to do that but i think we need that to happen can we do you think that's possible

1163
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:43,800
that if the name max is in the title of the song it's banned we have to put a

1164
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:47,980
but have to curse them want to do something I'm gonna talk I'm gonna see

1165
01:40:47,980 --> 01:40:51,100
if I can get a hold of them because I I don't know what we have to bribe him

1166
01:40:51,100 --> 01:40:56,060
with but I want it done I want my dream put to a stop ice cream is that a winner

1167
01:40:56,060 --> 01:41:00,620
I can send him lots of ice cream lots of ice cream and even my song will still be

1168
01:41:00,620 --> 01:41:02,620
And girl scout cookies.

1169
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:04,620
There's no max in the title at all.

1170
01:41:04,620 --> 01:41:06,620
We'll send, uh, girl scout cookies.

1171
01:41:06,620 --> 01:41:08,620
To Boaz. That always happens.

1172
01:41:08,620 --> 01:41:10,620
I'm seriously going to get in touch with him.

1173
01:41:10,620 --> 01:41:12,620
We'll see.

1174
01:41:12,620 --> 01:41:14,620
We'll send him girl scouts to serve us then.

1175
01:41:14,620 --> 01:41:16,620

1180
01:41:24,620 --> 01:41:26,620

1191
01:42:31,820 --> 01:42:37,460
op team. Your ops will help you out. All right, let's get to this. This is usually a part

1192
01:42:37,460 --> 01:42:40,700
of the show where I ask Loki what the hell's going on in the sim scene besides unnecessary

1193
01:42:40,700 --> 01:42:44,860
Max remixes, but I know there's quite a bit going on this week. There's some very colorful

1194
01:42:44,860 --> 01:42:47,940
things going on, so what's up?

1195
01:42:47,940 --> 01:42:52,780
Well, first off, I'd like to mention there's a common thing under DJ Pato's new remix,

1196
01:42:52,780 --> 01:42:59,020
which is Max Life Superior Cancer Mix. I don't know what the fuck that is, but I love his

1197
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:04,860
comment. This is the best, like, comment right here. It says, Alex Calderia and Badass, they

1198
01:43:04,860 --> 01:43:11,160
must meet to eat shit. I don't know what that means, but the whole quote, they must meet

1199
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:19,400
to eat shit, is funny. I don't know. But anyways, I digress. No, but April Fool's Day. You're

1200
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:23,700
only a fool if you didn't download these packs, because there are so many being released,

1201
01:43:23,700 --> 01:43:29,820
it's not even funny. We have the release of D3 Mix 2, which is just another DDR, like,

1202
01:43:29,820 --> 01:43:40,260
you know food mix type thing. One nice little 186 meg file there. We had LFT mix which was

1203
01:43:40,260 --> 01:43:46,680
also released that day. Strawberry Steps which was also released that day. All of these are

1204
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:51,980
just like Food Mix. Strawberry Steps actually has the videos just like Food Mix. All really

1205
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:56,560
good stuff to download, to at least play while you're waiting for Food Mix 2 to come out.

1206
01:43:56,560 --> 01:44:01,780
So check this out, if you're looking for links, there's a whole thread on Bomani style under

1207
01:44:01,780 --> 01:44:09,920
the DDR simulation form there, and that's Japanese DDR fan mix in parentheses like food

1208
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:14,420
mix watch, and check page 3 and there's your download links right there.

1209
01:44:14,420 --> 01:44:21,880
And supposedly coming out on the 15th is DDRXX mix, and so look for those to be coming out,

1210
01:44:21,880 --> 01:44:26,780
of good stuff they're constantly updating this thread with you know

1211
01:44:26,780 --> 01:44:31,300
everything that's coming out apparently the Japanese scenes look a lot better

1212
01:44:31,300 --> 01:44:38,140
than ours like most everything else that's gone oh and DDR UK I mentioned

1213
01:44:38,140 --> 01:44:41,820
they were coming up April 1st there was an April Fool's joke sort of they're

1214
01:44:41,820 --> 01:44:48,420
coming up they're actually launching Monday so look for DDR UK the coming

1215
01:44:48,420 --> 01:44:52,740
back when they're April Fool's joke something about who Konami supports us

1216
01:44:52,740 --> 01:44:56,340
now like any of us would believe that no they're actually April Fool's joke was

1217
01:44:56,340 --> 01:45:01,500
they're gonna be dancing all right dancing stage fusion UK or something

1218
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:06,740
like that it was for a little bit it was really stupid but um so that was up

1219
01:45:06,740 --> 01:45:10,460
there um but my self as far as I'm aware they didn't do an April Fool's thing

1220
01:45:10,460 --> 01:45:15,780
probably because last year is kind of retarded but um I don't know so yeah

1221
01:45:15,780 --> 01:45:19,780
Yeah, DDRUK is coming up tomorrow, supposedly.

1222
01:45:19,780 --> 01:45:26,780
Well, at least their joke wasn't something, like, really stupid, like, getting bought by, like, another media corporation or something, because that would just be stupid.

1223
01:45:26,780 --> 01:45:29,780
So, at least it was Konami, so...

1224
01:45:29,780 --> 01:45:34,780
Yeah. Yeah, that would suck.

1225
01:45:34,780 --> 01:45:40,780
So, yeah, nothing really going on in the sim scene other than, you know, more max remixes that suck.

1226
01:45:40,780 --> 01:45:44,780
But, you know, I've got to put a new one out every now and then just because, you know, I...

1227
01:45:44,780 --> 01:45:50,780
I don't know. I've been trying to make some other stuff, but, you know, this song...

1228
01:45:50,780 --> 01:45:56,780
Usually when I make stuff, it's usually to make something that's better than someone else's stuff, so...

1229
01:45:56,780 --> 01:46:01,780
Blame it on them. If they wouldn't put the stupid sim files out, I wouldn't get inspiration to make another max remix.

1230
01:46:01,780 --> 01:46:03,780
It's all their fault.

1231
01:46:03,780 --> 01:46:08,680
I swear I'm gonna write him an email as soon as this show's over and and say we

1232
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:12,720
want to interview you we want to talk to you about a very serious issue facing

1233
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:16,520
the Bahmani community and then and then spring it that we're we want to ban max

1234
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:21,800
remixes and we need his help because that site only perpetuates it encourages

1235
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:26,880
people to make max remixes about paranoia remixes you know what I haven't

1236
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:30,360
had my limit of that yet although I'm getting very close I you know in a

1237
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:36,240
perfect world we would ban max remixes paranoia remixes and there's another one

1238
01:46:36,240 --> 01:46:45,040
huh drop no not drop out there's another one that needs to be stopped maybe

1239
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:49,400
Sakura well Sakura is kind of another version of max 300 though so but but it's

1240
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:55,000
Sakura is awesome the original yeah but not remixes I haven't really heard too

1241
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:59,380
many remixes but nothing could you know I can't really consider Sakura a version

1242
01:46:59,380 --> 01:47:05,420
Max 300 just because it's so awesome on its own but only because it shares an

1243
01:47:05,420 --> 01:47:11,740
entire baseline for max 300 but it has the other that makes it instantly cool

1244
01:47:11,740 --> 01:47:15,540
now whatever they're gonna make banjo 300 or something like that and they'll

1245
01:47:15,540 --> 01:47:20,620
just have a banjo over the that would be awesome banjo 300 I thought of it a bag

1246
01:47:20,620 --> 01:47:24,500
now you don't get a whole lot of bag remixes but people that try to remix it

1247
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:29,020
try to be funny and usually it's like bag survivor anything was survivor

1248
01:47:29,020 --> 01:47:34,720
in the title that's it anything was survivor unless it's the destiny's child

1249
01:47:34,720 --> 01:47:37,420
song and even then I think somebody already did it so we don't need anymore

1250
01:47:37,420 --> 01:47:41,920
so that's it unless maybe you're gonna do like I have a tiger I don't know if

1251
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:46,320
anybody's done that that might be okay but I want like all like your cowgirl

1252
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:51,160
survivor the seven jump survivor let them move survivor I want that shit

1253
01:47:51,160 --> 01:48:03,100
stopped. Let me just point out, and to further Rob's argument about bad Max remixes, let

1254
01:48:03,100 --> 01:48:09,820
me just read to you the latest Max remixes that are being released right now. We have

1255

Max Borg Assimilation, Max Life Superior Cancer Mix, The Legend of Max OTLK Version, Max Unlimited,

1256
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:23,040
Sakura Max Unlimited 300, Max Fantasia Version 3, meaning there has been two more before that,

1257
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:30,040
Max 300 The Wacko Reflex Remix, Paranora Survivor Max, Max Energy High Voltage Remix,

1258
01:48:30,040 --> 01:48:36,040
Unlimited Legends of Max Version 2, Max Extension, 2 Max 330, and that...

1259
01:48:36,040 --> 01:48:40,040
Now, I'm gonna cut you off right there, because that is just in the past week.

1260
01:48:40,040 --> 01:48:42,040
That's just in the past week!

1261
01:48:42,040 --> 01:48:47,040
Fuckin' stop, people! Seriously!

1262
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:52,040
And then like you go into the week before, Love Love Shine Survivor Max.

1263
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:56,040
Yeah, just what we needed. Ass.

1264
01:48:56,040 --> 01:49:00,040
We'll get to the cage match winner in a little bit, but first we're gonna go to a quickie break.

1265
01:49:00,040 --> 01:49:05,040
And in this break, Max remixes! No, just kidding.

1266
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:10,040
We're gonna do, uh, I don't know. I wanna do a song that really doesn't suck.

1267
01:49:10,040 --> 01:49:14,040
What's a song like that just doesn't suck?

1268
01:49:14,040 --> 01:49:16,040
From what?

1269
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:18,040
How about the original song? We can do the original.

1270
01:49:18,040 --> 01:49:20,040
Yeah, play Sakura.

1271
01:49:20,040 --> 01:49:23,040
Even though it's kind of Max, but you're right.

1272
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:25,040
It's got the extra something something that makes it a little better.

1273
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:26,040
How about Xenon?

1274
01:49:26,040 --> 01:49:28,040
We'll do Xenon. I like that.

1275
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:30,040
Okay, I'm liking these ideas.

1276
01:49:30,040 --> 01:49:33,040
So, we will be back after this.

1277
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:37,040
I'm having trouble locating the Sakura file.

1278
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:39,040
I know I have it somewhere.

1279
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:44,440
doo-doo-doo-doo. Don't forget you can visit our website. We have the webcam over at www.orangeloungeradio.com.

1280
01:49:44,440 --> 01:49:49,540
Of course, there's not a whole lot interesting on webcam tonight, because we don't have quite a full studio, as we sometimes do.

1281
01:49:49,540 --> 01:49:53,740
But you'll catch one of us dancing in front of it once in a while, so it's definitely worth checking out.

1282
01:49:53,740 --> 01:49:56,340
Also, the chat room, of course.

1283
01:49:56,340 --> 01:50:02,840
Alright, we'll be back after this, with more Orange Lounge Radio, and we got the FUs of the Week coming up at some point.

1284
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:07,040
And we might have to do some kind of game tonight. We'll have to do some type of game or something as well.

1285
01:50:07,040 --> 01:50:09,040
So we'll be back after this

1286
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:44,040
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!

1287
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:38,040
Uh-huh

1288
01:54:38,040 --> 01:54:39,040
Uh-huh

1289
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:55,040
Uh-huh, uh-huh Uh-huh, uh-huh

1290
01:55:39,040 --> 01:55:43,040
The

1291
01:55:43,040 --> 01:55:47,040
The

1292
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:51,040
The

1293
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:55,040
The

1294
01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:59,040
The

1295
01:55:59,040 --> 01:56:03,040
The

1296
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:07,040
The

1297
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:46,820
For them practice!

1298
01:56:46,820 --> 01:56:51,400
Save it!

1299
01:56:51,400 --> 01:56:56,440
Save it!

1300
01:56:56,440 --> 01:57:21,160
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio and that break you heard a little bit of Sakura

1301
01:57:21,160 --> 01:57:25,960
followed by Xenon, R3 and Innocent Walls both by request from the chat.

1302
01:57:25,960 --> 01:57:29,960
Actually, the chat just said, play something Taku, so I picked one for you and played for a while.

1303
01:57:29,960 --> 01:57:31,960
Taku makes me all flush.

1304
01:57:31,960 --> 01:57:33,960
Or as you said in the chat room, Taku is sex.

1305
01:57:33,960 --> 01:57:34,960
Yes.

1306
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:36,960
Which is funny because then someone said, you know what, Jaime?

1307
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:39,960
You always come in here and you just say something is sex, and then you leave.

1308
01:57:39,960 --> 01:57:42,960
I am not obsessed.

1309
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:48,960
No, you're not necessarily saying Taku is sex, but you go in there and you'll be like, gorillas are sex.

1310
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:51,960
Or, you know, like, Orange House Radio is sex.

1311
01:57:51,960 --> 01:57:54,960
Or, you know, Splenda is sex.

1312
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:59,160
So Splenda is sweet. Splenda is sweet. But you know, you go in there,

1313
01:57:59,160 --> 01:58:03,760
oh my God, that's sex. You know, it's like me and that's hot. Like, you know.

1314
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:05,640
That hot. That's hot.

1315
01:58:05,640 --> 01:58:08,720
We need to tell them the story of that hot. Julie.

1316
01:58:08,720 --> 01:58:10,360
That hot. Can we get Julie and Mike?

1317
01:58:10,360 --> 01:58:12,280
Does Mike work? Oh yes, it does.

1318
01:58:12,280 --> 01:58:17,400
Okay. The story of that hot. There was a gentleman on Fantasy Star Online, well, I'm saying that

1319
01:58:17,400 --> 01:58:22,600
nicely about him, who would always, he kept trying to say that's hot. He's not originally

1320
01:58:22,600 --> 01:58:26,040
an English speaker, and it was very obvious that he would refer to everything as that

1321
01:58:26,040 --> 01:58:32,280
hot. And the phrase just kept carrying on and carrying on. He's a very unique individual.

1322
01:58:32,280 --> 01:58:36,920
His name is Guan Li, and he lives somewhere in Minnesota. I don't know exactly where,

1323
01:58:36,920 --> 01:58:41,720
but I know he's in Minnesota. Minnesota? Alrighty, back to the video on the show. Okay, that

1324
01:58:41,720 --> 01:58:48,320
hot, that hot. That's awesome. I might have to start saying that, that hot, ouch, that,

1325
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:52,360
somebody in the chair of that out that hot

1326
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:54,120
that's great

1327
01:58:54,120 --> 01:58:55,720
okay let's find out who

1328
01:58:55,720 --> 01:58:58,900
uh... one tonight's cage match

1329
01:58:58,900 --> 01:59:02,520
ready to find out when the cage match wasn't going to anyone

1330
01:59:02,520 --> 01:59:03,920
i'm fabulous

1331
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:05,580
and it is only here it is

1332
01:59:05,580 --> 01:59:09,240
the winner of tonight's cage match

1333
01:59:09,240 --> 01:59:13,240
three weeks

1334
01:59:13,240 --> 01:59:18,300
yoko kano with the rise you know that means was girls next week yoko kano

1335
01:59:18,300 --> 01:59:24,160
is going for retirement. That'll only be, if it gets retired next week, it'll be the

1336
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:27,300
third track in Orange Lounge history to get retired

1337
01:59:27,300 --> 01:59:31,560
behind Echo Image with Comeback and Gwen Stefani with Whatchu Waitin' For.

1338
01:59:31,560 --> 01:59:36,640
This is Yoko Kano is awesome. How Gwen Stefani made it four weeks with a bunch of top

1339
01:59:36,640 --> 01:59:39,280
40 haters I will never understand, but it really did.

1340
01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:42,720
People had no taste and voted for the sellout.

1341
01:59:42,720 --> 01:59:46,120
Alright, so there it is, Yoko Kano with Rise.

1342
01:59:46,120 --> 01:59:51,120
Next week is the retirement week, so Loki, you and I are gonna have to bring out the big guns.

1343
01:59:51,120 --> 01:59:54,120
Oh man, I have to bring girls back.

1344
01:59:54,120 --> 01:59:56,120
Oh wait, that's not the big guns.

1345
01:59:56,120 --> 01:59:57,120
Dear God, no.

1346
01:59:57,120 --> 01:59:59,120
Great, so it's all gonna come down to me, apparently.

1347
01:59:59,120 --> 02:00:03,120
So, I will have to find the perfect song.

1348
02:00:03,120 --> 02:00:08,120
I know something that they'll vote for every time, so I'll bring it next week.

1349
02:00:08,120 --> 02:00:12,120
I'm like, what echo image do I have that we haven't put in yet? Let's see.

1350
02:00:12,120 --> 02:00:16,820
No, it comes down to one name, Ayumi Hamasaki.

1351
02:00:16,820 --> 02:00:22,020
Oh, Ayumi, that's what we should do. Let's just make this, you know, we're gonna have to make them choose between like,

1352
02:00:22,020 --> 02:00:25,820
Yogo, Ayumi, and then I'll do Utada. And then we'll just like...

1353
02:00:25,820 --> 02:00:28,120
As long as it's not Easy Breezy.

1354
02:00:28,120 --> 02:00:30,320
Aw, but I like Easy Breezy.

1355
02:00:30,320 --> 02:00:31,720
And also Japaneasy.

1356
02:00:31,720 --> 02:00:37,220
I actually see the Easy Breezy video at the gay club once in a while, because I don't know, like,

1357
02:00:37,220 --> 02:00:41,420
Utada apparently has a gay following or something, who knew? Who knew?

1358
02:00:41,420 --> 02:00:44,780
but they actually show the easy breezy video there and like whenever it comes

1359
02:00:44,780 --> 02:00:48,300
on i'm the only person that kind of starts like smiling and kind of dancing

1360
02:00:48,300 --> 02:00:53,500
like you know and then all my friends are like oh god it's this song oh god

1361
02:00:53,500 --> 02:00:59,100
rob god you know what what i need to um

1362
02:00:59,100 --> 02:01:05,820
to send you one of her and uh shoot who was it it's it's some rapper

1363
02:01:05,820 --> 02:01:09,900
chick it was off of the uh rush hour 2 soundtrack

1364
02:01:09,900 --> 02:01:12,080
blow my whistle

1365
02:01:12,080 --> 02:01:12,880
uh...

1366
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:16,660
blow my whistle? I don't know who it was. Missy Elliott or something?

1367
02:01:16,660 --> 02:01:20,480
No, I don't think so, but it was one of her first English ones.

1368
02:01:20,480 --> 02:01:22,680
Oh, okay. Oh, it's a Japanese.

1369
02:01:22,680 --> 02:01:23,780
I'm sorry.

1370
02:01:23,780 --> 02:01:26,880
I thought you just said it. It's a tarehikaru.

1371
02:01:26,880 --> 02:01:27,960
Oh, I didn't know it was her.

1372
02:01:27,960 --> 02:01:32,500
Yeah, I'll find it. It's one of her early all-English ones.

1373
02:01:32,500 --> 02:01:36,060
Oh, I'll have to find it.

1374
02:01:36,060 --> 02:01:37,520
uh...

1375
02:01:37,520 --> 02:01:38,800
Moving on.

1376
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:46,500
I thought we could get into the DDR Freak post of the week, because of course, you know,

1377
02:01:46,500 --> 02:01:49,920
we have a lot of respect for our buddies over at DDR Freak, because of course, you know,

1378
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:53,960
well Jamie happens to be on the staff over there, and the fact that, not just that, but

1379
02:01:53,960 --> 02:01:59,340
we also have the replays that happen on DDR Freak Radio every Friday night.

1380
02:01:59,340 --> 02:02:03,380
So if you actually should miss an episode of Orange Lounge Radio, shame on you, but

1381
02:02:03,380 --> 02:02:07,520
you know, if you have a trip to Boston or something, just so you know, you don't have

1382
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:10,080
to screw up your vacation just so you can come home and listen to Orange on the Radio.

1383
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:15,200
You can catch it. We appreciate your loyalty. Yeah, you can catch it the week after on DDR

1384
02:02:15,200 --> 02:02:20,080
Freak. When I say the week after, I mean this Friday's show will actually be last Sunday's

1385
02:02:20,080 --> 02:02:23,640
show. It's kind of like a week gap, and that's just, I don't know why it is that way, but

1386
02:02:23,640 --> 02:02:27,320
it just is. I think that's to give us a little bit of a buffer should we miss a week or something.

1387
02:02:27,320 --> 02:02:32,500
It's to save our butt a little bit, so we'll see. Anyway, let's get into the DDR Freak

1388
02:02:32,500 --> 02:02:41,140
post of the week. Uh, I have a tie for the DDR Freak post of the week this week because

1389
02:02:41,140 --> 02:02:46,580
there's two really, really good ones. So we're going to start off with this one. It's a thread

1390
02:02:46,580 --> 02:02:52,620
and it was created in DDR Chit Chat, which is the home of great DDR Freak posts of the

1391
02:02:52,620 --> 02:03:00,620
week. We love our spam. This post was by a basic member and the subject is New Religion

1392
02:03:00,620 --> 02:03:09,480
anti-DDR forever and the post reads join my friends new religion anti-DDR

1393
02:03:09,480 --> 02:03:16,480
forever it's Christian based but it says that DDR is a sin he has added an extra

1394
02:03:16,480 --> 02:03:21,760
commandment no DDR by the way commandment was spelled without a D so he

1395
02:03:21,760 --> 02:03:25,700
added it was posted by an illiterate five-year-old he added an extra

1396
02:03:25,700 --> 02:03:34,040
commandment no DDR that's the post it's Christian based but they've added an

1397
02:03:34,040 --> 02:03:43,560
extra commandment they should meet Rob that that earns a yay he's a demo Beth

1398
02:03:43,560 --> 02:03:48,440
he's a demo now no but this is the funny thing this is what makes the post more

1399
02:03:48,440 --> 02:03:53,960
hilarious than anything is the signature says here this is the guy's signature

1400
02:03:53,960 --> 02:04:05,360
I'm single and it sucks who didn't think that like seriously I would like to know

1401
02:04:05,360 --> 02:04:09,160
was there anybody in the chat room when I said I'm single and it sucks is this

1402
02:04:09,160 --> 02:04:12,480
guy's signature is there anybody in the chair anybody out there listening that

1403
02:04:12,480 --> 02:04:17,840
didn't think I wonder why I have to know

1404
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:26,680
The third post down, oh yes. Somebody above it said WTF you're either a

1405
02:04:26,680 --> 02:04:30,040
complete idiot or just a terrible troll I'm guessing the latter and then the

1406
02:04:30,040 --> 02:04:34,920
next person said I'm guessing both and then this is great somebody else jumps

1407
02:04:34,920 --> 02:04:38,800
in there says ah and using the Lord's name in vain like you did in one of your

1408
02:04:38,800 --> 02:04:46,080
other posts is not a sin. Oh snap. Okay. Somebody totally served that guy. I need this thread

1409
02:04:46,080 --> 02:04:51,320

1413
02:05:06,600 --> 02:05:11,720
one other post because one DDR free post of the week is just not enough there

1414
02:05:11,720 --> 02:05:17,040
were too many good posts this week so we have another one here and it's actually

1415
02:05:17,040 --> 02:05:23,320
not a brand new topic but it was posted in an existing thread and it's in the

1416
02:05:23,320 --> 02:05:31,600
red octane ignition version 2.0 thread and this is post number 182 and this is

1417
02:05:31,600 --> 02:05:35,640
what's great is that you get to see what happens when DDR freak filters take over

1418
02:05:35,640 --> 02:05:42,060
here's the post looks like after Frick two weeks of use this pad is already

1419
02:05:42,060 --> 02:05:46,620
starting to give out here come the Frick random goods on seven footers Frick

02:05:46,620 --> 02:05:51,180
worthless piece of a hundred dollar garbage poopy buttocks Frick after a

1421
02:05:51,180 --> 02:05:55,980
frustrating B score on a heavy I threw the Frick pad on the floor and punch the

1422
02:05:55,980 --> 02:05:59,340
living Frick out of it and then I grabbed the cord and smacked it on

1423
02:05:59,340 --> 02:06:04,860

Don't frick, buy this red octane, can frick, suck my penis, then vomit and eat that too.

1425
02:06:13,340 --> 02:06:20,340
Frick poopy. I love the filters. I really do love the filters on DDR Freak.

1426
02:06:21,300 --> 02:06:27,540
That makes the whole post right there. Don't frick, buy this red octane, can frick, suck

1427
02:06:27,540 --> 02:06:31,740
my penis, then vomit and eat that too.

1428
02:06:31,740 --> 02:06:36,300
It's like a really bad version of like DDR Mad Libs or something.

1429
02:06:36,300 --> 02:06:41,740
Oh man, go to the filters, that's funny.

1430
02:06:41,740 --> 02:06:44,740
Frick you all, frick you all!

1431
02:06:44,740 --> 02:06:51,540
Man, DDR freak people post a bunch of freaking, freaking garbage.

1432
02:06:51,540 --> 02:06:52,540
What's that?

1433
02:06:52,540 --> 02:06:55,300
I don't stand for censorship in the chat room.

1434
02:06:55,300 --> 02:06:56,300
Oh.

1435
02:06:56,300 --> 02:06:57,300
Alright.

1436
02:06:57,300 --> 02:07:03,220
If you have a suggestion for DDR Freak post of the week, you can always send me a private

1437
02:07:03,220 --> 02:07:07,760
message on DDR Freak. My name is Skye, S-K-I-E. And actually some folks have done that. We

1438
02:07:07,760 --> 02:07:11,980
actually had, I think last week, or two weeks ago, was a user submitted post of the week.

1439
02:07:11,980 --> 02:07:17,780
So send those over. But please remember, if you see mental retardation going on on DDR

1440
02:07:17,780 --> 02:07:21,580
Freak, and it's not somebody who is actually mentally retarded, because that would be okay.

1441
02:07:21,580 --> 02:07:25,740
That's okay if somebody actually is mentally retarded. But if somebody is acting mentally

1442
02:07:25,740 --> 02:07:30,840
retarded you need to PM a moderator so they can lock the thread yes look you

1443
02:07:30,840 --> 02:07:36,240
know one hi send me a private message I can I'll make sure you're taken care of

1444
02:07:36,240 --> 02:07:41,740
yeah oh I'm sorry they wanted a link to that post as well with the Frick eat my

1445
02:07:41,740 --> 02:07:48,680

1446
02:07:48,680 --> 02:07:54,420
is remember guys it's post 182 in the thread it's a very large thread so have

1447
02:07:54,420 --> 02:08:01,580
fun with that all right you know there is a way you can get around those

1448
02:08:01,580 --> 02:08:04,580
filters if you're smart yeah but we're not gonna tell you yeah I'm not gonna

1449
02:08:04,580 --> 02:08:08,860
tell you but it's not that hard to figure out just you know you just have

1450
02:08:08,860 --> 02:08:12,300
to be bold about doing it that's all

1451
02:08:12,220 --> 02:08:22,140
what what what all right anyway what it wasn't funny when I read it it's all

1452
02:08:22,140 --> 02:08:24,780
No, but it made me laugh again the second time.

1453
02:08:24,780 --> 02:08:28,220
Because of all the caps and stuff, like it goes from caps to lower the caps.

1454
02:08:28,220 --> 02:08:29,660
It's just funny.

1455
02:08:29,660 --> 02:08:36,540
And I quote, poopy buttocks frick.

1456
02:08:36,540 --> 02:08:41,740
All right.

1457
02:08:41,740 --> 02:08:45,220
Let's see, what else are we going to get into here in NewsWise?

1458
02:08:45,220 --> 02:08:49,820
I thought there was some other news that needed some talking about here this week.

1459
02:08:49,820 --> 02:08:57,460
something going on you know we've got our podcast that goes on and you can

1460
02:08:57,460 --> 02:09:01,620
download that from our website www.orangelinerator.com and click on to go

1461
02:09:01,620 --> 02:09:05,320
and that's where you can figure out what's going on with the rest of the

1462
02:09:05,320 --> 02:09:08,820
gaming world we've kind of started to expand to talk a little bit more about

1463
02:09:08,820 --> 02:09:14,460
the general gaming world here on this program but you know we talk a lot about

1464
02:09:14,460 --> 02:09:18,320
other stuff on the other program you know somebody was asking in the chat

1465
02:09:18,320 --> 02:09:24,520
room earlier what happened with DDR featuring Mario and that was a good

1466
02:09:24,520 --> 02:09:28,080
question because we haven't heard a whole lot about DER featuring Mario

1467
02:09:28,080 --> 02:09:31,960
lately so I kind of decided hey as long as I'm on DER Freak making fun of people

1468
02:09:31,960 --> 02:09:38,480
maybe I'll go and actually get a useful thread and I went to check out what's

1469
02:09:38,480 --> 02:09:42,880
going on on the DDR GameCube thread and there's really not a whole lot going on

1470
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:48,940
right now apparently there might be screenshots in GMR magazine but there's

1471
02:09:48,940 --> 02:09:55,560
nothing really super official that has been announced yet so and then rumor is

1472
02:09:55,560 --> 02:10:02,240
that screenshots for the pad have come out recently but nothing super duper

1473
02:10:02,240 --> 02:10:07,300
official that we haven't already seen as of yet so there's that answers the DDR

1474
02:10:07,300 --> 02:10:12,540
featuring Mario question as well um I guess what we're gonna do now is we're

1475
02:10:12,540 --> 02:10:15,640
gonna go ahead and get a little bit angsty so if you guys want to go ahead

1476
02:10:15,640 --> 02:10:21,240
and submit some F use of the week to my private inbox there in the chat room

1477
02:10:21,240 --> 02:10:26,000
just send me a private message we will start to get angsty with a little

1478
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:29,240
segment we call the F use of the week and Jamie why is it that we have to do

1479
02:10:29,240 --> 02:10:33,040
the FUs of the week every single freaking week.

1480
02:10:33,040 --> 02:10:40,040
Because the world sucks! This world is bullshit!

1481
02:10:50,940 --> 02:10:55,660
A FU to my busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, did I say busy?

1482
02:10:55,660 --> 02:10:58,960
Schedule. Okay.

1483
02:10:58,960 --> 02:11:03,400
work all the damn time. I go to the gym, I go to school,

1484
02:11:03,400 --> 02:11:07,300
and then by the time I get home I'm too damn tired to do anything else

1485
02:11:07,300 --> 02:11:10,240
except work on, you know,

1486
02:11:10,240 --> 02:11:13,120
whatever projects I happen to have going on.

1487
02:11:13,120 --> 02:11:17,320
A big F.U. to, uh,

1488
02:11:17,320 --> 02:11:20,640
putting a lot of hard work into something and then

1489
02:11:20,640 --> 02:11:22,920
not having it recognized.

1490
02:11:22,920 --> 02:11:29,400
And that's happened several times over the past week, so I've been kind of eh.

1491
02:11:29,400 --> 02:11:35,040
F you to my driver's side window for randomly becoming detached from the mechanism that

1492
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:39,160
holds it up and rolling itself down, creating a loud whistling noise not unlike that heard

1493
02:11:39,160 --> 02:11:40,160
in a hurricane.

1494
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:43,520
It's really aggravating when I'm trying to listen to my good music really, really loud

1495
02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:47,800
in my little, you know, 93 treble.

1496
02:11:47,800 --> 02:11:51,360
My speakers are bad enough as it is.

1497
02:11:51,360 --> 02:11:56,080
F.U. to the person who was going 10 miles under the speed limit when I'm trying to go 20 over.

1498
02:11:56,080 --> 02:12:00,760
I hope that no CHP people are listening to that.

1499
02:12:00,760 --> 02:12:05,840
And a big F.U. to myself for not being able to decide on what my next hair color should be.

1500
02:12:05,840 --> 02:12:12,000
Maybe I should leave that to the chat room. Find me a haircut and find me a hair color because I'm getting

1501
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:17,320
damn tired of what I have now. And a big F.U. toward

1502
02:12:17,320 --> 02:12:20,840
having people not recognize how

1503
02:12:20,840 --> 02:12:22,840
Much of a fabulous celebrity I am.

1504
02:12:22,840 --> 02:12:23,840
I'm done.

1505
02:12:23,840 --> 02:12:26,720
said

1506
02:12:26,720 --> 02:12:30,520
low-key it's all you

1507
02:12:30,520 --> 02:12:34,600
okay first off fuck you to god damn

1508
02:12:34,600 --> 02:12:39,720
me hitting a car that fucking sucked and you know that just totally

1509
02:12:39,720 --> 02:12:43,520
put a big huge roadblock in my perfect weekend

1510
02:12:43,520 --> 02:12:47,280
so fuck you that um also

1511
02:12:47,280 --> 02:12:53,120
um fuck the fact that uh Mitch Hedberg had to die because he was touring with

1512
02:12:53,120 --> 02:12:55,620
steven clinton out of an awesome to see

1513
02:12:55,620 --> 02:12:58,620
now i think that the people in

1514
02:12:58,620 --> 02:13:00,180
uh...

1515
02:13:00,180 --> 02:13:02,120
and uh...

1516
02:13:02,120 --> 02:13:06,160
but he did the pope for not dying fast enough for me to make a joke about it on

1517
02:13:06,160 --> 02:13:07,520
april fool's day

1518
02:13:07,520 --> 02:13:11,780
god damn it you know he's clean-to-life you just need to die

1519
02:13:11,780 --> 02:13:15,200
die quickly and he was going there and read about the right to tell it

1520
02:13:15,200 --> 02:13:18,440
okay yet we're just waiting for them separated okay

1521
02:13:18,440 --> 02:13:22,380
and i mean they weren't even try and he was just like you know dying

1522
02:13:22,380 --> 02:13:29,220
the hell with him and um also um i know i had some other ones oh once again fuck you

1523
02:13:29,220 --> 02:13:34,420
to me for hitting that car um only because the car was an SUV being driven by women and

1524
02:13:34,420 --> 02:13:40,820
you know how i say women drivers women who drive SUVs fucking suck there's a big you

1525
02:13:40,820 --> 02:13:47,980
know bit of irony for me so um oh well i i live it last accident been it was like seven

1526
02:13:47,980 --> 02:13:51,860
years ago anyways so and this is like not even doesn't even really even

1527
02:13:51,860 --> 02:13:59,420
qualify as an accident since I did no damage to my car so whatever um and I

1528
02:13:59,420 --> 02:14:02,780
think that's finally it fuck you to me for having this goddamn headache and it

1529
02:14:02,780 --> 02:14:07,460
really sucks so yeah for some reason I feel really hot right now too I think I

1530
02:14:07,460 --> 02:14:11,460
to turn the air on. That's it. That's all for now.

1531
02:14:19,460 --> 02:14:23,460
F you to the fact that there's been so much death in the media lately,

1532
02:14:23,460 --> 02:14:27,460
like between that chick in Florida and the Pope. I'm sick of hearing about people dying.

1533
02:14:27,460 --> 02:14:31,460
Let's hear about something happy once in a while. I want to hear about Disneyland

1534
02:14:31,460 --> 02:14:35,460
getting a new ride or something. So just, God, find

1535
02:14:35,460 --> 02:14:42,420
find something happy to report on once in a while you guys dang um an f you to

1536
02:14:42,420 --> 02:14:47,940
um damn there's something else goes around in my tongue I asked you to

1537
02:14:47,940 --> 02:14:52,840
PSPs for costing so much money an f you to work drama I had on Friday nothing

1538
02:14:52,840 --> 02:14:57,300
terrible but just I was an angsty little man on Friday and I didn't participate

1539
02:14:57,300 --> 02:15:01,740
in April Fool's Day really as much as I wanted to because of things that were

1540
02:15:01,740 --> 02:15:05,440
going on on Friday and it just I hate it when things put me the bad mood like

1541
02:15:05,440 --> 02:15:14,700
that bar so and then F you to the fact that I think my car needs repairs because

1542
02:15:14,700 --> 02:15:17,700
I don't like having to pay for that stuff that's all right it's not your

1543
02:15:17,700 --> 02:15:21,600
fault unless you were the one that broke my car then it is your fault no I didn't

1544
02:15:21,600 --> 02:15:28,160
all right and then I also F you lastly F you to the house of wax for having

1545
02:15:28,160 --> 02:15:30,160
Paris Hilton in it. That's not hot.

1546
02:15:30,160 --> 02:15:32,160
Hey, what if she dies?

1547
02:15:32,160 --> 02:15:36,320
You know what? That's what I was saying. Since she doesn't have top billing, she's likely

1548
02:15:36,320 --> 02:15:40,160
to be an extra character that gets offed in the movie. So that would be worth seeing.

1549
02:15:40,160 --> 02:15:45,160
I noticed in the trailer the first thing that they show her is making a sex tape.

1550
02:15:45,160 --> 02:15:50,160
Oh, but I'm sure that's supposed to be funny. Nope. Sorry.

1551
02:15:50,160 --> 02:15:56,660
Comedy. Let's go to the rest of the room here and get their FUs. Starting off with DDR Angel

1552
02:15:56,660 --> 02:15:57,660
and then over to Julie.

1553
02:16:26,660 --> 02:16:28,660
But, nobody else did, so that's kind of sad.

1554
02:16:29,660 --> 02:16:31,660
And, let's see.

1555
02:16:32,660 --> 02:16:33,660
I think that's it.

1556
02:16:33,660 --> 02:16:34,660
Oh yeah.

1557
02:16:34,660 --> 02:16:38,660
And uh, F you to, uh, Ultra Mix 2's load time.

1558
02:16:38,660 --> 02:16:39,660
Cause that's sad.

1559
02:16:41,660 --> 02:16:42,660
Alright, Julie!

1560
02:16:43,660 --> 02:16:48,660
F you to the stupid person who on the way here tried to cut me off and made me go all the way around.

1561
02:16:48,660 --> 02:16:51,660
Um, F you to my schedule, I agree with that.

1562
02:16:51,660 --> 02:16:55,860
with that and f you I agree with all the people dying though the Pope got on the

1563
02:16:55,860 --> 02:17:00,940
anniversary of my cat's death which is kind of interesting and by the way at

1564
02:17:00,940 --> 02:17:04,020
Disneyland there is something happy going on on May 5th they're doing their

1565
02:17:04,020 --> 02:17:07,140
big anniversary celebration that needs to be in the news I'm sick of all the

1566
02:17:07,140 --> 02:17:11,240
death too there we go see I want to hear about happy children partying at

1567
02:17:11,240 --> 02:17:15,940
Disneyland and then getting blown away with bombs no I'm saying I'm kidding I'm

1568
02:17:15,940 --> 02:17:24,220
not that sadistic. Alrighty, and I guess that's the end of my F.U. for today. Alright. I do

1569
02:17:24,220 --> 02:17:27,660
like what the chat room is saying though, they're suggesting that there be a Kingdom

1570
02:17:27,660 --> 02:17:37,460
Hearts ride added at Disneyland. That would be hot. That hot. That hot. That hot. Great,

1571
02:17:37,460 --> 02:17:42,700
you can tell Gwan that he's infected Orange Lounge Radio now. I will let Gwan know. We're

1572
02:17:42,700 --> 02:17:45,480
We're gonna get a shirt with all our new catchphrases that we have invented.

1573
02:17:45,480 --> 02:17:46,480
Demub-ass?

1574
02:17:46,480 --> 02:17:47,480
That-hot?

1575
02:17:47,480 --> 02:17:48,480
What else do we have?

1576
02:17:48,480 --> 02:17:49,480
Death cake?

1577
02:17:49,480 --> 02:17:50,480
Death cake?

1578
02:17:50,480 --> 02:17:51,480
We'll see.

1579
02:17:51,480 --> 02:17:54,680
You will have tea and cake with the vicar or you will die!

1580
02:17:54,680 --> 02:18:01,480
The new one, um, they need to meet and eat poop, or eat shit.

1581
02:18:01,480 --> 02:18:05,160
The one that was from DJ Pito's thing.

1582
02:18:05,160 --> 02:18:08,040
I still go with poopy buttocks frick.

1583
02:18:08,040 --> 02:18:13,560
Frick poopy eat my penis and vomit too or whatever the hell that said.

1584
02:18:13,560 --> 02:18:14,560
You know what our shirt should be?

1585
02:18:14,560 --> 02:18:16,640
It should just be a bunch of DDR freak posts.

1586
02:18:16,640 --> 02:18:21,760
No, we just need this shirt that says OLR that hot.

1587
02:18:21,760 --> 02:18:25,600
OLR that hot.

1588
02:18:25,600 --> 02:18:27,200
That would be just fabulous.

1589
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:28,200
I like that idea.

1590
02:18:28,200 --> 02:18:29,200
We'll have to see.

1591
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:30,200
Okay.

1592
02:18:30,200 --> 02:18:35,000
Anyway, let's get to the chatroom FUs, shall we?

1593
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:41,080
Thank you, Captain Jack, who's going to be walking us through the chatroom FUs.

1594
02:18:41,080 --> 02:18:44,640
I don't think you can pronounce this all one word, and if I...

1595
02:18:44,640 --> 02:18:45,640

1596
02:18:45,640 --> 02:18:46,640

02:18:46,640 --> 02:18:47,640
Lxldoobs.

1598
02:18:47,640 --> 02:18:48,640
We'll say that, Lxldoobs.

1599
02:18:48,640 --> 02:18:49,640
Lxldoobs?

1600
02:18:49,640 --> 02:18:50,640
I don't know.

1601
02:18:50,640 --> 02:18:58,520
Lxldoobs says, I need to send an FU to Resident Evil 4 for making me kill Spanish-speaking

1602
02:18:58,520 --> 02:18:59,520
monsters.

1603
02:18:59,520 --> 02:19:00,520
What's next?

1604
02:19:00,520 --> 02:19:02,520
Lawn mowing aliens?

1605
02:19:02,520 --> 02:19:08,560
illusion says f you to myself for falling asleep before robot chicken last

1609
02:19:27,160 --> 02:19:29,080
It's not on torrentbox, but I found it.

1610
02:19:29,080 --> 02:19:29,880
So it's out there.

1611
02:19:33,160 --> 02:19:36,760
DJ Tyrant says, F you to having to play 11

1612
02:19:36,760 --> 02:19:38,720

1613

John Field says, F you to running out of space

1616
02:19:45,360 --> 02:19:46,760
again in my computer.

1617
02:19:46,760 --> 02:19:47,600
I can't believe it.

1618
02:19:47,600 --> 02:19:50,840
I'm at 773.17 gigabytes, and I've

1619
02:19:50,840 --> 02:19:53,880
used almost all of it up again.

1620
02:19:53,880 --> 02:19:54,380
Yes.

1621
02:19:54,380 --> 02:19:55,200
I win.

1622
02:19:55,200 --> 02:19:57,200
I just bought that 400 gig,

1623
02:19:57,200 --> 02:20:00,100
I just bought that 400 gig hard drive in January.

1624
02:20:00,100 --> 02:20:02,640
I really need cheap terabyte drives.

1625
02:20:02,640 --> 02:20:04,860
Also, F you to this stupid raid card

1626
02:20:04,860 --> 02:20:08,080
that crashes my computer randomly and unrecoverably.

1627
02:20:08,080 --> 02:20:11,180
F you to turning my room into the pigsty that it is now.

1628
02:20:11,180 --> 02:20:12,980
F you to not enough hours in the week.

1629
02:20:12,980 --> 02:20:14,980
Oh, and F you to daylight savings time.

1630
02:20:14,980 --> 02:20:16,620
Why does this exist?

1631
02:20:16,620 --> 02:20:19,780
Thank you, oh my God, I completely forgot.

1632
02:20:19,780 --> 02:20:23,200
A giant F you to daylight savings time.

1633
02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:24,380
Because of daylight savings time,

1634
02:20:24,380 --> 02:20:30,260
I didn't get to bed until 6 in the morning today. That's bad. I mean, 5 in the morning

1635
02:20:30,260 --> 02:20:34,820
is pretty bad. 6 in the morning, really bad. So, you know, just F you to Daylight Savings

1636
02:20:34,820 --> 02:20:38,700
Time. I hate you. Please die. Why do we have Daylight Savings Time? Somebody told me it's

1637
02:20:38,700 --> 02:20:43,140
a farmer's thing. That they did it so that farmers could get up at a reasonable hour

1638
02:20:43,140 --> 02:20:49,500
and tend to the crops. You know what? Julie? Yeah, it was due because there was some votes

1639
02:20:49,500 --> 02:20:53,460
and actually there's some areas of the United States that don't actually observe it. It's

1640
02:20:53,460 --> 02:20:58,820
because they were mad parents were having their kids walk to school while it was dark.

1641
02:20:58,820 --> 02:21:01,100
The farm thing I'm not doubting is true as well.

1642
02:21:01,100 --> 02:21:02,100
Get the kid a flashlight.

1643
02:21:02,100 --> 02:21:03,100
I agree.

1644
02:21:03,100 --> 02:21:04,100
Get the kid a gun.

1645
02:21:04,100 --> 02:21:05,100
I totally agree with that.

1646
02:21:05,100 --> 02:21:09,580
I dig daylight savings time though because then I get to drive to work in the dark again.

1647
02:21:09,580 --> 02:21:10,580
It weirds me out.

1648
02:21:10,580 --> 02:21:13,060
Because I get to drive to work at 6am in the morning.

1649
02:21:13,060 --> 02:21:16,100
Unless our kids walk to school anyways.

1650
02:21:16,100 --> 02:21:32,100
Honestly, I mean, buses pick up any kids that are, like, one mile, you know, further away. I mean, who gives a shit? Most people don't walk anyways, and the people that do walk, oh no. Yeah, because you know all those muggers out there that want to steal their kids' lunch money.

1651
02:21:32,100 --> 02:21:43,100
Woo! Seriously, in this part of town where I'm from, like, you know, all the 16-year-olds have SUVs anyway, and they're all driving to school, so, whatever. Anyway, sorry. Let's get back to the FUs.

1652
02:21:43,100 --> 02:21:51,180
Rama says, fuck you to the city of Boston for not having beer.

1653
02:21:51,180 --> 02:21:52,180
Argh!

1654
02:21:52,180 --> 02:21:56,820
We had to travel out in the suburbs for it, and the liquor stores closed at 9.

1655
02:21:56,820 --> 02:21:59,040
Fuck this nonsensical period in bullshit.

1656
02:21:59,040 --> 02:22:00,040
Fuck Boston.

1657
02:22:00,040 --> 02:22:01,280
Oh yeah, fuck Red Sox.

The programs keep crashing in my class, thus taking forever to finish my final project.

FU to the Farley brothers and Jimmy Fallon for making the Boston Red Sox movie.

1665
02:22:27,860 --> 02:22:33,420
Nintz says FU to the place I ordered my PS2 flip top from, it's 2 weeks late and I can't

little bit of a break. We're gonna come back from this break and open up the

1682

lines for some Ask Orange Lounge. Oh yes, one of your favorite segments. And if we

1683
02:23:54,340 --> 02:23:57,280

02:24:03,400 --> 02:24:04,400
We'll make Loki sing.

No, we'll have something fun to talk about.

1688

02:24:21,400 --> 02:24:27,620
And these look like this blockbuster sort of, I don't really want to say the convention,

1692
02:24:27,620 --> 02:24:30,840
like sales conference type thing that's in Texas.

1693
02:24:30,840 --> 02:24:35,760
And they're bringing DDR and Curiosity Revolution to play.

1694
02:24:35,760 --> 02:24:38,800
So they want to try it out here to see what it is.

1695
02:24:38,800 --> 02:24:39,800
So I gotta bring it in.

1696
02:24:39,800 --> 02:24:40,800
Yay me.

02:24:40,800 --> 02:24:45,320

02:24:51,400 --> 02:24:53,400
We'll be back after this.

1701
02:25:51,400 --> 02:25:56,400
Gonna take your fear away, flyin' like a snow-ed dove out of the temple of love

1702
02:25:57,400 --> 02:26:04,400
Come into the temple of love, together we'll rage through the heavens above

1703
02:26:04,400 --> 02:26:07,400
Come to the temple of the heart of your soul

1704
02:26:07,400 --> 02:26:11,400
We can join the devil's measure

1705
02:28:37,400 --> 02:28:39,400
Why do

1706
02:29:37,400 --> 02:29:50,400
Come on, come on, do the locomotion with me

1707
02:29:50,400 --> 02:29:53,400
Come on, you got the notion

1708
02:29:53,400 --> 02:29:56,400
Do it back, yeah

1709
02:29:56,400 --> 02:30:00,400
Everybody's doing a brand new dance now

1710
02:30:00,400 --> 02:30:03,400
Come on, baby, do the locomotion

1711
02:30:03,400 --> 02:30:07,400
I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now

1712
02:30:07,400 --> 02:30:10,400
Come on baby, do the love, come on

1713
02:30:10,400 --> 02:30:14,400
My little baby says it's you and me

1714
02:30:14,400 --> 02:30:17,400
It's easy to love if you're everything

1715
02:30:17,400 --> 02:30:22,400
So come on, come on, do the love, come on, share with me

1716
02:30:22,400 --> 02:30:26,400
We gotta swing our heads round

1717
02:30:26,400 --> 02:30:31,400
Come on baby, do the love, come on, do the love

1718
02:30:31,400 --> 02:30:42,400
Now that you can do it, we'll make a treat Now, come on baby, we'll do it, do it, do it

1719
02:30:42,400 --> 02:30:46,400
Now, just turn the motion like the way we treat

1720
02:30:46,400 --> 02:30:54,400
Now, come on baby, do it, do it, do it Now we're losing control, a little bit of

1721
02:30:54,400 --> 02:31:01,400
Hi, this is Mel B of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute of my girls, I'm going to

1722
02:31:24,400 --> 02:31:27,400
and Melvie can join us on all the fun together.

1723
02:31:27,400 --> 02:31:32,400
Hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to

1724
02:31:32,400 --> 02:31:36,400
and still the fun is just as great. It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

1725
02:31:36,400 --> 02:31:41,400
Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

1726
02:31:41,400 --> 02:31:46,400
Here we are back on Orange Lounge Radio and I'm surprised we didn't get a lot of comment from the chat room.

1727
02:31:46,400 --> 02:31:53,400
Usually they give us some shit there when we play like, you know, songs that are kind of weird

1728
02:31:53,400 --> 02:31:57,060
and we played the locomotion there from dance maniacs nobody said anything about

1729
02:31:57,060 --> 02:32:00,280
it or at least maybe I missed it they might have said it but I missed it

1730
02:32:00,280 --> 02:32:07,960
anyway let's get into some ask orange lounge we got some time to fill here

1731
02:32:07,960 --> 02:32:15,680
tonight so we're gonna get into this and then I might try to do a little bit of

1732
02:32:15,680 --> 02:32:18,480
news too if we kind of run out of questions but it looks like a lot of you

1733
02:32:18,480 --> 02:32:22,800
guys have some questions you've got to know the answer to so we'll get into

1734
02:32:22,800 --> 02:32:34,440
that? Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question. What will we find out this week?

1735
02:32:34,440 --> 02:32:40,560
On Orange Lounge Radio, you can tell that we need to fill a little time. Thirty minutes

1736
02:32:40,560 --> 02:32:50,800
to be exact. So I hope this segment is long tonight. Slow news week, what can we say?

1737
02:32:50,800 --> 02:32:52,640
Illusion says, question.

1738
02:32:53,640 --> 02:32:55,440
Here is a question for Sky.

1739
02:32:55,440 --> 02:32:57,080
Oh God, I should have known this subject

1740
02:32:57,080 --> 02:32:58,640
would come up tonight.

1741
02:32:58,640 --> 02:33:02,880
How could you not absolutely love Sin City with a passion?

1742
02:33:02,880 --> 02:33:05,300
He's referencing a live journal post I made earlier

1743
02:33:05,300 --> 02:33:08,560
this week that said simply, Sin City,

1744
02:33:08,560 --> 02:33:11,560
all style, little substance.

1745
02:33:11,560 --> 02:33:13,520
First to give the points tonight,

1746
02:33:13,520 --> 02:33:15,420
we'll do a little point counterpoint.

1747
02:33:15,420 --> 02:33:17,560
I will let Loki gush about Sin City.

1748
02:33:17,560 --> 02:33:31,560
Since it was awesome. First of all, it's very stylistic. It did have substance. It had much substance. Very, very much substance.

1749
02:33:31,560 --> 02:33:39,560
Anyways, it was basically the best adaptation of a comic book that's ever been made. They actually didn't even make a screenplay for it. It was done straight from the comic book.

1750
02:33:39,560 --> 02:33:52,560
Um, I loved it, actually, um, my favorite parts were those of, um, I believe it was, the big fat kill was pretty good. I, I liked that with all the, um, horrors with guns. Gotta love that.

1751
02:33:52,560 --> 02:34:08,560
Um, I especially loved, uh, I believe her name was Miho or something like that. She was badass. I mean, that, that, that's something that Jamie would like because, I mean, totally Battle Royale-ish. It's very awesome. You would just be like, this chick kicks ass.

1752
02:34:08,560 --> 02:34:09,560
Okay.

1753
02:34:09,560 --> 02:34:12,560
I would recommend Katie do this movie.

1754
02:34:12,560 --> 02:34:16,560
Because honestly, Miho, she's up there.

1755
02:34:16,560 --> 02:34:17,560
She's up there pretty high.

1756
02:34:17,560 --> 02:34:20,560
Well, I do have a thing for violence, so...

1757
02:34:20,560 --> 02:34:27,560
I mean, she's just like this whore who has samurai swords and protects all the other ones.

1758
02:34:27,560 --> 02:34:30,560
Obviously, but she's just like, you know...

1759
02:34:30,560 --> 02:34:32,560
So she's a good lady that kicks ass?

1760
02:34:32,560 --> 02:34:33,560
Something like that.

1761
02:34:33,560 --> 02:34:37,340
stars and she's chopping off people's limbs and stuff like that and just

1762
02:34:37,340 --> 02:34:44,020
completely badass. Okay. And then then you have Elijah Wood. I've never thought

1763
02:34:44,020 --> 02:34:50,700
I'd see Elijah Wood as creepy as he was. He was a cannibal and just like crazy

1764
02:34:50,700 --> 02:34:54,680
it's just like it almost reminds me of Spider-Man if Spider-Man were a cannibal.

1765
02:34:54,680 --> 02:35:01,660
That's pretty much what Elijah Wood was. Frodo eating the other hobbits. Frodo plus

1766
02:35:01,660 --> 02:35:05,660
Plus Harry Potter equals scare, seriously, because it looked like Harry Potter.

1767
02:35:31,660 --> 02:35:36,660
Why do you bring your kids to see this movie? It's a rated R movie, it's not meant for kids. Why do you bring your kids?

1768
02:35:36,660 --> 02:35:38,660
Because they're stupid and don't read up on stuff to begin with.

1769
02:35:38,660 --> 02:35:47,660
And then later on you're gonna say, well I think it's all about Sin City, so that's why they ripped off Mommy's arm, and now I'm suing, you know, um, Miramax.

1770
02:35:49,660 --> 02:35:50,660
Fuck that.

1771
02:35:50,660 --> 02:35:53,660
It's the world of people who can't think for themselves.

1772
02:35:53,660 --> 02:35:59,780
Alright, my turn. I did not dislike Sin City, so I don't want to be labeled as a Sin City

1773
02:35:59,780 --> 02:36:04,100
hater, because I did enjoy the movie, but I also do not believe that this, like, I have

1774
02:36:04,100 --> 02:36:08,580
seen at least three different people declare this the best movie ever made, and I definitely

1775
02:36:08,580 --> 02:36:12,300
don't think it's the best movie ever made. I think I'll see a better movie this year.

1776
02:36:12,300 --> 02:36:15,820
But it's a good movie still! I don't really want to see it again, but I thought it was

1777
02:36:15,820 --> 02:36:19,420
a good movie, and I just recommended it to Jamie, so, you know, I don't have bad things

1778
02:36:19,420 --> 02:36:23,820
to say about the movie but here were my issue with it it was very stylistic like

1779
02:36:23,820 --> 02:36:30,060
it looked so sexy the look was so great the acting really ruined some of it for

1780
02:36:30,060 --> 02:36:36,420
me because you had some people that were acting one way like kind of that I don't

1781
02:36:36,420 --> 02:36:40,460
know that element of the 30s you know noir style and some folks that just

1782
02:36:40,460 --> 02:36:45,460
couldn't act like we're trying to take the comic book lines like really

1783
02:36:45,460 --> 02:36:50,840
literally I think and we're kind of almost camping, campy with it. And I would put probably

1784
02:36:50,840 --> 02:36:57,740
Britney Murphy in that category and the chick that played Goldie or whatever and the other,

1785
02:36:57,740 --> 02:37:03,140
I don't know, there's that Goldie chick. It's basically most of the women except for the

1786
02:37:03,140 --> 02:37:07,260
one who played like the queen whore, like she was like queen of the whores. She was

1787
02:37:07,260 --> 02:37:12,140
bad ass, okay? She was pretty cool. But a lot of the acting just kind of didn't do it

1788
02:37:12,140 --> 02:37:16,800
for me so that was just me and you know I just thought it went on like really

1789
02:37:16,800 --> 02:37:19,980
really really long and I kind of would have thought a comic book movie would

1790
02:37:19,980 --> 02:37:22,740
have been a little more fast-paced like there were some scenes in movie that

1791
02:37:22,740 --> 02:37:26,220
were very fast-paced I was like when it was like really fast-paced I enjoyed it

1792
02:37:26,220 --> 02:37:30,620
but a lot of it was just very like but don't get me wrong I didn't think it was

1793
02:37:30,620 --> 02:37:36,660
bad I just didn't think it was like big oh my god greatest thing ever anyway um

1794
02:37:36,660 --> 02:37:47,540
Let's see. More questions. We do have more questions. You can still ask questions if

1795
02:37:47,540 --> 02:37:53,140
you want you guys. Let's see. Dark Knight wanted to follow up to something he was

1796
02:37:53,140 --> 02:37:56,180
saying in his F.U. earlier. He said something about an employee stealing

1797
02:37:56,180 --> 02:38:00,340
from the store. Someone got caught last night, ended up only being two cashiers

1798
02:38:00,340 --> 02:38:06,300
that night, and I had to work in women's, so not fun. And he's asking,

1799
02:38:06,300 --> 02:38:09,520
So are we having a slow cam night? Yeah, we are having a slow cam night. Sorry guys

1800
02:38:09,520 --> 02:38:15,800
That's because our special guest is hiding from the cam. She's stealing my stick. I you will we're gonna

1801
02:38:15,800 --> 02:38:18,100
I'm supposed to be the mysterious

1802
02:38:18,900 --> 02:38:24,380
Co-host here's the interesting thing. Is that in about two or three weeks now?

1803
02:38:24,380 --> 02:38:27,100
We're not that far away Orange Lounge radio studio is moving

1804
02:38:27,100 --> 02:38:31,900
So in the new studio, the webcam will be set up completely differently. So that's my head

1805
02:38:31,900 --> 02:38:36,500
you know it'll be interesting to see what we set it up in the new studio but

1806
02:38:36,500 --> 02:38:39,420
on my head and have the Sakura cam well the weird thing is we're not gonna be

1807
02:38:39,420 --> 02:38:43,460
able to do the itoy cam either so I'll have to get creative who cares I have

1808
02:38:43,460 --> 02:38:47,340
another webcam I just don't use it because I didn't like it I haven't

1809
02:38:47,340 --> 02:38:52,820
really thought the logistics of the webcam out yet so we'll see anyway

1810
02:38:52,820 --> 02:38:58,660
question from LXL doobs why haven't we gotten orange lounge radio t-shirts yet

1811
02:38:58,660 --> 02:39:06,300
pay for them the problem with t-shirts is that in order to get t-shirts you

1812
02:39:06,300 --> 02:39:11,100
have to buy a bunch of them up front and if you're not able to sell them then you

1813
02:39:11,100 --> 02:39:14,440
have to take a loss and none of us are financially able to take a loss right

1814
02:39:14,440 --> 02:39:18,420
now what we may do I do want to do t-shirts I think we have enough of a

1815
02:39:18,420 --> 02:39:22,100
following where we could get enough small t-shirts but it would be the type

1816
02:39:22,100 --> 02:39:25,420
of thing where it's like pre-order and I know a lot of folks don't like the

1817
02:39:25,420 --> 02:39:29,260
pre-order thing but that's just so that we wouldn't lose any money you know and

1818
02:39:29,260 --> 02:39:32,580
we'd only order enough shirts for those that would pre-order it so if we do do

1819
02:39:32,580 --> 02:39:36,400
shirts in the future which we are wanting to do before e3 so you may see

1820
02:39:36,400 --> 02:39:40,100
this coming in the next month it would probably be something where it's

1821
02:39:40,100 --> 02:39:46,540
pre-order only but we'll post more deals details to the website when we know more

1822
02:39:46,540 --> 02:39:50,820
information and we also have to get some shirt designs we don't know exactly what

1823
02:39:50,820 --> 02:40:00,320
we want right now olr that hot that's pretty good that hot we'll see excuse me

1824
02:40:00,320 --> 02:40:05,760
mpq wants to know what should I do if my beatmania 2dx arrives before my flip-top

1825
02:40:05,760 --> 02:40:12,480
drive does or flip-top ps2 does wait longer you shouldn't have bought a

1826
02:40:12,480 --> 02:40:22,140
a modded ps2 to begin with that's pretty stupid only buy the real thing um look

1827
02:40:22,140 --> 02:40:25,100
at the manual and look how pretty the manual does try to translate the

1828
02:40:25,100 --> 02:40:28,360
Japanese in the manual that'll be fun and see those of us who actually have a

1829
02:40:28,360 --> 02:40:35,040
jps2 will be enjoying their 2dx because we bought a jps2 oh we just had our

1830
02:40:35,040 --> 02:40:39,560
typo of the night in the chat room somebody was trying to say this dark

1831
02:40:39,560 --> 02:40:46,560
Night said orange lounge radio is almost classified as a klut meant to say cult but say klut.

1832
02:40:49,840 --> 02:40:56,840
We just need t-shirts with typos on them. Shut up klut. Lemon Lime Jump says I plan

1833
02:41:02,420 --> 02:41:08,060
on gathering up a posse to get a DDR machine put in at my college. What's a good mix to

1834
02:41:08,060 --> 02:41:12,740
get I guess everyone I guess everyone will have a different opinion but what

1835
02:41:12,740 --> 02:41:17,660
does everyone in the studio think um my opinion is that extreme is kind of

1836
02:41:17,660 --> 02:41:22,060
hoard like you can go almost everywhere and find an extreme so really for me

1837
02:41:22,060 --> 02:41:26,140
it's all about the retro at this point so I think a good DDR mix it would be

1838
02:41:26,140 --> 02:41:30,420
fun to have retro so either fourth plus I think fourth plus is definitely a

1839
02:41:30,420 --> 02:41:37,340
great one to have fifth mix or third Korean both plus third plus third plus

1840
02:41:37,340 --> 02:41:40,520
is a kind of expensive the third mix third Koreans you get pretty cheap can't

1841
02:41:40,520 --> 02:41:46,280
you second mix was fun yeah second mix had step battle in it and nothing is as

1842
02:41:46,280 --> 02:41:50,120
cool as step battle I would urge you to do just whatever is cheap and affordable

1843
02:41:50,120 --> 02:41:54,560
for your college which I believe third Koreans the cheapest um so that or fourth

1844
02:41:54,560 --> 02:41:57,680
plus a fifth mix would be a good deal too because there were a lot of songs in

1845
02:41:57,680 --> 02:42:02,000
fifth mix that didn't show up anywhere else so I think fifth mix is definitely

1846
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:06,840
something good to check out um but don't get I mean if you of course you could

1847
02:42:06,840 --> 02:42:10,680
always get an extreme but the thing is is that everybody has an extreme so it

1848
02:42:10,680 --> 02:42:14,000
really depends and I don't know what kind of area you live in but check out

1849
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:18,800
DDR freak machine locations put in your zip code and see what kind of machines

1850
02:42:18,800 --> 02:42:22,800
are in your area and if you have three or four extreme machines within ten

1851
02:42:22,800 --> 02:42:26,880
miles well then go for something different and that'll kind of lure

1852
02:42:26,880 --> 02:42:29,780
people to the college it'll lure the people to play those extreme machines

1853
02:42:29,780 --> 02:42:35,140
to you know old stuff is new again I'm actually surprised nobody in our chat

1854
02:42:35,140 --> 02:42:40,500
room said F that get in the groove which really would be another option honestly

1855
02:42:40,500 --> 02:42:43,980
that might be something you might want to see if there's interest in I'm not

1856
02:42:43,980 --> 02:42:48,460
gonna dog on in the group but you know lemon lime jump just wants to clarify

1857
02:42:48,460 --> 02:42:52,260
this is Pensacola unfortunately I don't know the Pensacola area I wasn't what

1858
02:42:52,260 --> 02:42:56,900
school I've been to Florida once I don't I lived an hour from Pensacola what

1859
02:42:56,900 --> 02:43:01,020
school I don't know I'm wait I'll wait for lemon lime jump first I'll talk to

1860
02:43:01,020 --> 02:43:04,900
lemon line jump just PME okay but here's the thing I've been in Florida for a

1861
02:43:04,900 --> 02:43:08,900
a whopping one hour in my life and it was a layover when I was seven years old.

1862
02:43:08,900 --> 02:43:12,900
Alright, anyway.

1863
02:43:12,900 --> 02:43:16,900
Flaronay says, do you guys still have the

1864
02:43:16,900 --> 02:43:20,900
Let Them Move MP3? If so, can you play it at the end of this show

1865
02:43:20,900 --> 02:43:24,900
please? Do you have that? Loki, wasn't that your thing

1866
02:43:24,900 --> 02:43:28,900
to let them move the cow doing the Let Them Move? Do you remember that?

1867
02:43:28,900 --> 02:43:32,900
Do you have that? Can you find it? Can you see if you still have it so I can

1868
02:43:32,900 --> 02:43:37,780
play it okay see if you have that we can fit that in for you Florina it's pretty

1869
02:43:37,780 --> 02:43:43,340
funny and we haven't done that joke in months Rama says seriously are we gonna

1870
02:43:43,340 --> 02:43:49,260
see some orange on his radio t-shirts yes we want to do the t-shirts I we will

1871
02:43:49,260 --> 02:43:53,380
have something up within the next couple weeks we just need a shirt design so we

1872
02:43:53,380 --> 02:43:58,820
need some folks to design a shirt for us hint hint hint maybe we'll do a contest

1873
02:43:58,820 --> 02:44:02,820
we have CDs to give away we could do a contest we don't we have anime

1874
02:44:02,820 --> 02:44:06,460
screeners to that have to get given away we got the apple seed prize pack still

1875
02:44:06,460 --> 02:44:10,660
we got to give away at some point huh I mean we'll do a we'll do a contest that

1876
02:44:10,660 --> 02:44:13,060
might be fun

1877
02:44:17,020 --> 02:44:21,820
lemon-lime jump just wanted to clarify it's UWF is the school she goes to

1878
02:44:21,820 --> 02:44:29,700
University of West Florida. I guess, yeah. RPGKing7 says question, how are you guys able

1879
02:44:29,700 --> 02:44:37,220
to get into E3? DDRFreak. DDRFreak is a registered business, so Dark Soccer is able to get in

1880
02:44:37,220 --> 02:44:45,420
that way. Loki? I'm a game, I do game sales at my company. I mean, I don't think you can

1881
02:44:45,420 --> 02:44:51,300
get any more in the business than that. Unfortunately that leaves me out in the cold this year.

1882
02:44:51,300 --> 02:44:55,120
year I had some buddies at a particular gaming company that we talked an awful

1883
02:44:55,120 --> 02:45:00,440
lot about on this station that helped me get into e3 and helped Loki get in as

1884
02:45:00,440 --> 02:45:03,200
well unfortunately I don't have that luxury this year so I'm kind of on my

1885
02:45:03,200 --> 02:45:07,800
own so I don't know if I'm going to e3 this year I will find out this week so

1886
02:45:07,800 --> 02:45:11,320
we'll have something on that on Sunday cuz I'm gonna send in the paperwork this

1887
02:45:11,320 --> 02:45:15,360
week so we'll see what happens but actually if I do get into e3 it'll be

1888
02:45:15,360 --> 02:45:18,540
strictly because of orange launch radio which is kind of cool but we are an

1889
02:45:18,540 --> 02:45:30,780
official business as well now, too, so. Anyway. SSJ100Matt. Which are better video game movies

1890
02:45:30,780 --> 02:45:36,500
or comic book based movies? By the way, you've got to play Girls Butts. Girls Butts is so

1891
02:45:36,500 --> 02:45:43,060
two weeks ago. Well, we'll see. We'll see about the Girls Butts thing. What are better

1892
02:45:43,060 --> 02:45:49,660
video game- oh, which is better? Video game based movies, or comic book based movies?

1893
02:45:49,660 --> 02:45:53,180
On the whole, I would say comic book based movies have been better.

1894
02:45:53,180 --> 02:46:03,180
I would definitely second that. That's like comparing a BB gun with a thermonuclear

1895
02:46:03,180 --> 02:46:11,480
warhead. There's no comparison. I mean, when you look at the old school Batman,

1896
02:46:11,480 --> 02:46:16,240
I mean, that alone, right there. And then maybe, um, what else? The Spider-Man was really

1897
02:46:16,240 --> 02:46:21,520
good. It's comic book movies are awesome. And, unfortunately, um, you know, the, uh,

1898
02:46:21,520 --> 02:46:27,600
um, of course there have been bad comic book movies, Catwoman.

1899
02:46:27,600 --> 02:46:31,880
You know, that wasn't, that wasn't the comic book's fault, that was the director's fault.

1900
02:46:31,880 --> 02:46:37,680
And we know who that director is, and we are trying to stop them as we speak, you know.

1901
02:46:37,680 --> 02:46:41,400
That wasn't Uwe Boll, the directed Catwoman, was it?

1902
02:46:41,400 --> 02:46:43,400
I think it was.

1903
02:46:43,400 --> 02:46:46,480
You sh- oh. You sure?

1904
02:46:46,480 --> 02:46:48,960
Let me check. I'm gonna check.

1905
02:46:48,960 --> 02:46:51,480
I'm almost positive.

1906
02:46:51,480 --> 02:46:54,520
You do that. You check.

1907
02:46:54,520 --> 02:46:55,520
Go to the database.

1908
02:46:55,520 --> 02:46:58,080
But find the let them move thing first.

1909
02:46:58,080 --> 02:47:01,440
We need that.

1910
02:47:01,440 --> 02:47:06,440
I can't is not a term I understand.

1911
02:47:06,440 --> 02:47:13,760
Alright, we're running out of questions here, no more questions at least I see for Ask Orange

1912
02:47:13,760 --> 02:47:16,380
Lounge unless I missed something, I don't think so.

1913
02:47:16,380 --> 02:47:20,000
So we're going to go ahead and close up the old mailbag there and what we're going to

1914
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:23,560
do now is we're going to take a quick break, just a quick two song break and we're going

1915
02:47:23,560 --> 02:47:27,200
to come back and a couple of quick other little stories and notes and then we're going to

1916
02:47:27,200 --> 02:47:28,200
end tonight's show.

1917
02:47:28,200 --> 02:47:34,240
So we will be back after this featuring a very, very old DDR song and a very, very new

1918
02:47:34,240 --> 02:47:36,240
DDR song.

1919
02:47:36,240 --> 02:47:43,240
We'll be back after this.

1920
02:48:06,240 --> 02:48:08,240
Wai-ai-ai-ai

1921
02:48:08,240 --> 02:48:11,740
You keep a pocket full of green, green dollars

1922
02:48:11,740 --> 02:48:14,240
I love you, boy, it's the time

1923
02:48:15,240 --> 02:48:18,740
You're very hard, you snooze like a young fella

1924
02:48:18,740 --> 02:48:22,240
Take me overnight

1925
02:48:22,240 --> 02:48:24,240
Boom, boom, boom, boom

1926
02:48:24,240 --> 02:48:25,740
Something like a boom-boom

1927
02:48:25,740 --> 02:48:27,740
Boom, boom, boom, boom

1928
02:48:27,740 --> 02:48:29,240
Back to order

1929
02:48:29,240 --> 02:48:31,240
Boom, boom, boom, boom

1930
02:48:31,240 --> 02:48:32,740
Pushing all the buttons

1931
02:50:32,740 --> 02:50:50,820
I don't even know if anyone gets that promo anymore.

1932
02:50:50,820 --> 02:50:54,700
That was when we were at the house for the show.

1933
02:50:54,700 --> 02:50:56,460
Uh huh, that was the first studio.

1934
02:50:56,460 --> 02:51:02,140
And they were watching Hentai on the main TV, and I walk into the room and the first

1935
02:51:02,140 --> 02:51:08,920
thing I see is animated ass all over the screen like oh ass and then we made the

1936
02:51:08,920 --> 02:51:14,800
problem suddenly it was a promo yeah all right um just so you guys know we

1937
02:51:14,800 --> 02:51:18,400
actually found something that we promised we would play so we're gonna do

1938
02:51:18,400 --> 02:51:22,840
one other song here for you guys so enjoy this you should get a kick out of

1939
02:51:22,840 --> 02:51:31,360
this or not this is NMR featuring Jack Jack Jackazid Jackazid enjoy

1940
02:51:52,840 --> 02:52:00,840
The money jacker, throw to the sideline, the mic's a dead line, but case they rewind, use them as guidelines.

1941
02:52:00,840 --> 02:52:02,840
A hip raffle like the way you do it, what you do with it?

1942
02:52:02,840 --> 02:52:04,840
It ain't lookin' like a toothpick.

1943
02:52:04,840 --> 02:52:06,840
Can't get with instrumental record power.

1944
02:52:06,840 --> 02:52:08,840
My lyrical tongue will be like Cinderella's power.

1945
02:52:08,840 --> 02:52:37,260
That sounds like a dying cow at the end.

1946
02:52:37,260 --> 02:52:41,740
Oh Wilber, it's just a sprain, although that's a horse, but whatever.

1947
02:52:41,740 --> 02:52:44,700
That was an old fortune cookie.

1948
02:52:44,700 --> 02:52:45,700
Like years ago.

1949
02:52:45,700 --> 02:52:48,780
That was like from episode 4.

1950
02:52:48,780 --> 02:52:51,100
That feels weird, like, I don't think it's that old, but...

1951
02:52:51,100 --> 02:52:55,860
Oh yeah, it is that old, because this was when I was still not eating beef.

1952
02:52:55,860 --> 02:53:04,180
And we went to, um, we were going to Panda Express, and I had that nasty eggplant crap,

1953
02:53:04,180 --> 02:53:06,700
and then we were trying to think of what we were going to do, and I was like, this eggplant

1954
02:53:06,700 --> 02:53:11,020
makes me think of dead horse because it was all rubber. Oh, oh, the Wilbur thing. Yeah,

1955
02:53:11,020 --> 02:53:13,940
yeah, yeah. That was an old-ass Portuguese. That was an old Portuguese. I thought you

1956
02:53:13,940 --> 02:53:22,240
meant the let them move thing. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. The, the horse thing. I always

1957
02:53:22,240 --> 02:53:26,020
love doing this. We bring this up once every couple months or so, and since the, you know,

1958
02:53:26,020 --> 02:53:30,420
the show's gotten some additional new listeners lately, we'll do this one more time here.

1959
02:53:30,420 --> 02:53:34,460
We used to do these, but they kind of took a lot of work, so we don't really do them

1960
02:53:34,460 --> 02:53:41,460
so much anymore, but we used to do these little flashback promos, they're hilarious.

1961
02:53:41,460 --> 02:53:47,460
Take a look back at episode number one.

1962
02:53:47,460 --> 02:53:50,460
Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.

1963
02:53:50,460 --> 02:53:52,460
Attention to parents at Golf Land.

1964
02:53:52,460 --> 02:53:54,460
This goes for not just Roseland Golf Land, but any golf land.

1965
02:53:54,460 --> 02:53:55,460
Any arcade.

1966
02:53:55,460 --> 02:53:57,460
Jamie circulates a lot.

1967
02:53:57,460 --> 02:53:58,460
She gets around, Jamie.

1968
02:53:58,460 --> 02:54:00,460
Oh yeah, baby.

1969
02:54:00,460 --> 02:54:05,460
If you don't mother your child, Jamie will.

1970
02:54:05,460 --> 02:54:07,460
Yes, I will spank your child.

1971
02:54:07,460 --> 02:54:09,460
If you're not going to do your job, God damn it, I will.

1972
02:54:09,460 --> 02:54:13,960
Join us every Sunday night from 7 o'clock until 9 o'clock.

1973
02:54:13,960 --> 02:54:16,960
Yeah, you see how old that is? That's when we were on this old schedule there.

1974
02:54:16,960 --> 02:54:18,960
So, very interesting there.

1975
02:54:18,960 --> 02:54:21,960
Listen to how horrible our microphones were, too.

1976
02:54:21,960 --> 02:54:23,460
I was using the headset.

1977
02:54:23,460 --> 02:54:26,460
You could hear Irene in the background. She sounded like she was in a tin can.

1978
02:54:26,460 --> 02:54:27,460
You know, like,

1979
02:54:27,460 --> 02:54:29,960
What is going on, you guys?

1980
02:54:29,960 --> 02:54:35,960
I was using the headset and I ended up with like a migraine by the end of the show.

1981
02:54:35,960 --> 02:54:38,960
Remember I passed out in the show?

1982
02:54:38,960 --> 02:54:42,960
That was terrible. We were in the front. We were in the living room.

1983
02:54:42,960 --> 02:54:46,960
That was certainly fun. And then I went to L.A.

1984
02:54:46,960 --> 02:54:50,960
You did. So you were gone for a couple weeks. Let's do one more flashback.

1985
02:54:50,960 --> 02:54:54,960
These are kind of fun. I like the flashbacks.

1986
02:54:54,960 --> 02:54:58,960
So you guys can respect the roots of Orange Lounge Radio. Let's do a flashback from episode...

1987
02:54:58,960 --> 02:55:02,960
1, 2, 3, 4. Let's do a flashback from episode 4.

1988
02:55:02,960 --> 02:55:12,960
Next week on the show we're going to have our very first special guest.

1989
02:55:12,960 --> 02:55:18,460
We're actually having over Melody and Mel B and they're going to be our guests on the

1990
02:55:18,460 --> 02:55:22,960
show and I get to clean house all week to be ready for them.

1991
02:55:22,960 --> 02:55:23,960
Oh God.

1992
02:55:23,960 --> 02:55:27,120
I have to move everything out and deliver because this room is cramped as it is when

1993
02:55:27,120 --> 02:55:28,120
we do the show here.

1994
02:55:28,120 --> 02:55:32,060
I'd have to do so and they're quite tricky and moist.

1995
02:55:32,060 --> 02:55:34,060
How are you feeling a little moist tonight, Jamie?

1996
02:55:34,060 --> 02:55:36,060
Oh, every night on the show.

1997
02:55:36,060 --> 02:55:41,060
As Irene makes his face.

1998
02:55:41,060 --> 02:55:44,060
Orange Lounge Radio makes you moist as a snake.

1999
02:55:44,060 --> 02:55:51,060
Join us every Sunday night from 7 p.m. until 9 p.m. Pacific Standard Time for the Orange Lounge.

2000
02:55:51,060 --> 02:55:53,060
Jamie was moist.

2001
02:55:55,060 --> 02:55:57,060
And I still am!

2002
02:55:57,060 --> 02:55:59,060
I remember she got pissed off about that one too.

2003
02:55:59,060 --> 02:56:00,060
I did.

2004
02:56:00,060 --> 02:56:05,660
she's like, DON'T PUT THAT IN THE BOWBO, YOU CAN'T, WHY DID YOU DO THAT, ROB, WHY?

2005
02:56:06,020 --> 02:56:09,020
But now she goes over that, and I, I...

2006
02:56:09,020 --> 02:56:12,320
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob...

2007
02:56:14,100 --> 02:56:14,600
Rob!

2008
02:56:14,840 --> 02:56:15,340
Yes?

2009
02:56:15,740 --> 02:56:18,540
RrrooooOOOoooOOoRrrooooooRrreEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEe figured

2010
02:56:18,540 --> 02:56:23,280
Loki, before we finish up the show, give us some more, uh, PSP hacking news,

2011
02:56:23,280 --> 02:56:25,460
because this is what you're all about ever since you got a PSP,

2012
02:56:25,460 --> 02:56:28,120
I noticed you were watching a video earlier, yeah, tell us about that too.

2013
02:56:28,120 --> 02:56:34,060
That was the great game launcher you honestly have to like seriously twist a PSP to get to launch a game

2014
02:56:34,060 --> 02:56:38,420
And I don't know about you, but who twists a fucking you know console system wipeout

2015
02:56:39,340 --> 02:56:44,100
You need to twist the damn game for wipeout. I don't twist it when I play wipeout

2016
02:56:44,100 --> 02:56:49,580
This isn't like some sort of jog con type thing. This is you know a game system

2017
02:56:49,580 --> 02:56:51,820
You don't try to twist it of course. It's gonna break

2018
02:56:52,340 --> 02:56:54,340
Not meant to twist

2019
02:56:54,340 --> 02:56:56,340
Yeah, people are retarded.

2020
02:56:56,340 --> 02:57:03,340
Anyways, no, um, so yeah, apparently the, um, PSP IRC thing has been slashdotted, so that went that site.

2021
02:57:03,340 --> 02:57:09,340
And same with the PSP browser, that has been slashdotted as well, so that site's down.

2022
02:57:11,340 --> 02:57:12,340
What's this?

2023
02:57:14,340 --> 02:57:16,340
Haha, funny.

2024
02:57:16,340 --> 02:57:24,340
oh man honestly who the hell does this kind of stuff is what I want to know

2025
02:57:24,340 --> 02:57:33,020
um in other news though I will be reporting this later it has been done in

2026
02:57:33,020 --> 02:57:38,980
the first alpha will be coming up next month that's right Linux is on the DS go

2027
02:57:38,980 --> 02:57:43,940
Linux if it runs with electricity there will be Linux on it

2028
02:57:43,940 --> 02:57:47,860
Linux for the toaster. I want Linux for the toaster.

2029
02:57:47,860 --> 02:57:51,780
And from what I read, iTunes. iTunes for the PSP.

2030
02:57:51,780 --> 02:57:58,980
I will never understand what the charm is about being able to install Linux

2031
02:57:58,980 --> 02:58:05,040
on insert system here. I don't understand, like what is that just because people

2032
02:58:05,040 --> 02:58:08,620
think they're gonna be able to run all the Linux programs on it and everything

2033
02:58:08,620 --> 02:58:12,180
so I don't understand. Why do people try to install Linux on like

2034
02:58:12,180 --> 02:58:15,740
you know what was the one we had that the fish on the wall had a

2035
02:58:15,740 --> 02:58:19,940
Linux installed on it? What the hell is that? You know what I want to do?

2036
02:58:19,940 --> 02:58:24,060
And I realized this the other day when I was looking at my PSP. I'm like what the hell is this

2037
02:58:24,060 --> 02:58:24,620
button?

2038
02:58:24,620 --> 02:58:27,860
What is this thing? What is this little thing on the top here?

2039
02:58:27,860 --> 02:58:31,740
It's an infrared port. So you know what you can do? You can use this as a remote.

2040
02:58:31,740 --> 02:58:35,260
I want a program on here where I can turn off TVs with the PSP.

2041
02:58:35,260 --> 02:58:40,100
So you can walk around Walmart

2042
02:58:40,100 --> 02:58:44,020
just you know getting electronics out oh i'm just i'm trying out a psp

2043
02:58:44,020 --> 02:58:46,420
click click click click all the tvs are going off

2044
02:58:46,420 --> 02:58:48,580
actually i want to get what didn't you order one of those keychains i thought

2045
02:58:48,580 --> 02:58:51,140
you're going to order the keychain that shuts them all off

2046
02:58:51,140 --> 02:58:54,260
no i never got around to that damn we need to get one and we need to figure

2047
02:58:54,260 --> 02:58:58,100
out how to increase the strength of this and go in the best buy

2048
02:58:58,100 --> 02:59:00,820
watch the magic

2049
02:59:01,780 --> 02:59:07,220
like an emp i don't remember i don't remember what it does but it's

2050
02:59:07,220 --> 02:59:09,860
like a little little thing that you put on your keychain and what it does is

2051
02:59:09,860 --> 02:59:14,760
basically cycles through like a hundred different popular televisions and their

2052
02:59:14,760 --> 02:59:19,880
power off signal that's awesome I want one so you can like go in if the TV's

2053
02:59:19,880 --> 02:59:23,360
too loud at a restaurant or whatever you just get out your little keychain and if

2054
02:59:23,360 --> 02:59:27,420
you hold it for 15 seconds eventually the TV will turn off I still want the

2055
02:59:27,420 --> 02:59:31,820
the portable EMP so I can aim it at people's cell phones while they're

2056
02:59:31,820 --> 02:59:39,040
driving I was thinking I need to find the the actual Wi-Fi thing in here and I

2057
02:59:39,040 --> 02:59:43,080
it's been taken apart before and find the Wi-Fi but I want to like make a

2058
02:59:43,080 --> 02:59:47,160
little me satellite dish so go with this you know except on a tripod so I can

2059
02:59:47,160 --> 02:59:51,000
connect you know it's a hot spots there like a mile away or something that'd be

2060
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:55,880
fun this is great though I mean honestly I didn't know that some people had

2061
02:59:55,880 --> 02:59:59,120
unprotected networks and all I did is walk around outside today you know kept

2062
02:59:59,120 --> 03:00:03,640
hitting you know scan scan and I get like I found three different networks

2063
03:00:03,640 --> 03:00:09,340
one with the password on it. Well, actually two with passwords, one that's not. So, you

2064
03:00:09,340 --> 03:00:16,900
know, it's sort of like, you know, a dumb person's version of, you know, I forget, war

2065
03:00:16,900 --> 03:00:21,260
driving. You should walk around the complex and just, you just look like you're playing

2066
03:00:21,260 --> 03:00:26,540
your PSP and scan. But can you download files from the networks? No, not on the PSP yet.

2067
03:00:26,540 --> 03:00:31,540
Not yet, but I was reading some other things today on the site. There's a cord out there

2068
03:01:01,540 --> 03:01:10,220
on my PSP. Alright, anyway, more PSP pirating and hacking news to come later on Orange Lounge

2069

Radio, but for now, that's it, three hours are up. Tune into the podcast if you want

2070
03:01:15,420 --> 03:01:19,620

2072
03:01:27,380 --> 03:01:36,100
brain's not working. Bye. Julie. I want to kill some Sims. It's fun. Killing Sims is

2073
03:01:36,100 --> 03:01:45,180
fun. Uh, Loki. Now do you have the, um, the, uh, what was it, the college update for, um,

Reject false icons. Last word of the show, one word to sum it

final word of the show. Good night everybody, see you next week. Thanks for listening.

Pepperoni, Pizza and Delores dip Nobody can make a donut do the things you do

2084
03:03:11,940 --> 03:03:18,940
Believe me baby, believe me baby I've tried one or two

2085
03:03:18,940 --> 03:03:24,940
I've eaten meatballs in Sweden And pork chops in Peru

2086
03:03:24,940 --> 03:03:31,940
But all it did, all it did, all it did, all it did, all it did was remind me of you, baby.

2087
03:03:31,940 --> 03:03:34,940
And your mashed potatoes.

2088
03:03:34,940 --> 03:03:36,940

2090
03:03:38,940 --> 03:03:40,940
Patch of butter.

Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2092
03:04:10,940 --> 03:04:24,540
Alright, that's going to do it for tonight's show everybody, thanks a lot for listening

2093
03:04:24,540 --> 03:04:27,280
and supporting us as always, we appreciate your support.

2094
03:04:27,280 --> 03:04:30,900
We are going to go from our basic broadcast, or I'm sorry, back from our live broadcast

2095
03:04:30,900 --> 03:04:33,860
mode to our basic broadcast, so you're going to get disconnected, but just reconnect to

2096
03:04:33,860 --> 03:04:38,940
the stream in about 15 seconds to resume listening to all your favorite ER, 2DX, and Dance Mania

2097
03:04:38,940 --> 03:04:39,940
favorites.

2098
03:04:39,940 --> 03:04:45,760
you guys. In the studio we have actually a clock here that actually shows us the

2099
03:04:45,760 --> 03:04:49,360
time and it's like a bar clock and it lights up this like neon blue it's very

2100
03:04:49,360 --> 03:04:52,180
pretty and when all lights are off it makes everything shine blue which is

2101
03:04:52,180 --> 03:04:56,480
very nice but the clock was always an hour ahead so whenever we would look at

2102
03:04:56,480 --> 03:05:01,120
it we'd have to go okay well it says you know the show actually ends at 10 30 but

2103
03:05:01,120 --> 03:05:05,160
now thanks to Daylight Savings Time we didn't we didn't have to get up there

2104
03:05:05,160 --> 03:05:11,960
and change the clock. The clock's right now. Laziness prevails again. And on that

2105
03:05:11,960 --> 03:05:15,920
thought, have a great night everybody. We'll see you next week. Reconnect in 15

2106
03:05:15,920 --> 03:05:18,200
seconds
