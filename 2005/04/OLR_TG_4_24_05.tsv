623	3425	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of April 25th, 2005.
3545	14573	You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
14853	18355	Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
21537	25960	Hello, good morning, afternoon, or evening to you, whatever the case may be.
26220	29763	See, that's kind of the neat thing about podcasts, is that you can listen to them whenever you feel like it.
30598	39626	Well, you are listening to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your home for gamer chat and what gamers really want to know when you talk about games that don't suck.
40266	41467	A couple that do, sometimes.
42248	43789	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
43849	48953	Joining me as always, my awesome co-host, say hello to Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.
49514	50034	Woo!
50775	51275	Woo!
52216	52736	Exciting.
52977	53777	Exciting day, isn't it?
54278	54458	Old.
54918	57540	Also with us, say hello to Loki.
57560	58561	Hello.
58581	59562	Hi, how you doing?
60487	60947	DarkSakura.com
90666	94688	The same position I always keep during the show, which is in this big comfy green thing.
94708	95889	In your big comfy green chair.
96149	96409	Yeah.
96549	101292	Alright, anyway, let's start off talking about our own gaming week and then we'll get into some gaming news.
101312	102752	We've got a lot of interesting news tonight.
103253	104713	Starting off though, how was your gaming week?
104733	106334	What kind of games have you been playing this week, DarkSakura?
106354	107415	I finally played Luminous.
108015	108615	Ooh, what'd you think?
109756	110657	It was pretty fun.
110697	111237	I liked the music.
111257	115299	I did the single player mode, which I got to level 13 on.
116199	119161	You start off picking your skin, so that's all I did.
120576	123558	So you didn't play the mode where you progressed through the different skins.
123598	124619	You just stuck with one.
125139	126560	Yeah, I picked one skin and got to level 13.
126600	127981	That's cool.
128521	135246	Now, I'll tell you, the weird thing about Luminous when you're playing that skin mode the first time where you're going through the different skins is you kind of don't expect it.
135767	138649	So you're playing and then suddenly all the colors change.
138669	140370	You're like, what the hell did I do?
140430	141411	Why is everything changing color?
142252	142892	It's kind of freaky.
143272	144193	It does sound pretty freaky.
145334	148036	Apart from that, it was more widescreen pong and...
149201	150181	Not a lot much else.
150281	151261	Usual webby games.
151922	157243	Yeah, I avoided the Jeep simulator again because it really made me motion sick.
157483	161023	Is it just me or are we kind of a little bit of a dry spell right now?
161063	165224	I mean, sure, there's some games, but we're kind of in a dry spell right now until E3.
165284	166645	That's going to be like the big boom.
166825	171726	I'm pissed off because Dan traded my copy of Darkstalkers for stupid Midnight Club.
172026	172966	What's Midnight Club?
173026	173666	I don't even know.
173706	174366	Dub Edition.
174566	176647	I think that's one of those games we don't talk about on this show usually.
178329	192132	The last Midnight Club that I played, I cheated the hell out of it and we basically got this jet car type thing where we're just driving super fast around for no reason.
192693	194993	Alright, well how was your gaming week since we're on you anyway?
196754	197954	Ridge Racer, PSP.
198971	199572	That is it.
199872	206057	Yeah, because you're in the middle of moving right now, so you're probably like me, because when you hear about how my gaming week was, it's very similar.
206698	207739	No consoles this week, really.
207759	217307	I played Final Fantasy for all of one minute to log in to get the update, and then, well, obviously I didn't take a minute, but, you know, logged in, said hi, and then logged out, and that was it.
217868	224854	And, um, just now that Comcast is down, um, I can't play my online game, um,
225509	245326	No, so I've been playing a lot of PSP because I bring my PSP to work in my Tashi case so it looks like I have a briefcase walking in but it's actually my PSP and I play that during breaks and during lunch and whatnot and so I've been like playing a race here, a race there, unlocking cars as I go along and I'm actually pretty good at the game.
247048	251592	I kind of, I have fishtail every now and then but I'm getting the drifting down pretty good and apparently I
252418	255699	I drift a lot because that's how you get the nitros in the game.
256739	257679	I get a lot of nitros.
258379	258999	It's pretty cool.
259019	260599	I like how they have all the old tracks in it.
261220	261600	Very cool.
263940	266481	Have you heard about any new hacks on the PSP lately?
266981	267621	What isn't there?
269061	269361	Let's see.
269401	273682	There's the hack where you can control your iTunes with your PSP.
273742	274902	Oh, I read about that one too.
276222	280363	There's the hack where you can control your house with the PSP assuming you have a wired house, which
282280	283541	All of five people have.
283601	285901	How many people our age have wired houses like that?
285941	288342	I want one.
288442	290243	Want and have are different things, though.
290283	292363	PSP Tetris, but it's just online Tetris.
293163	295884	All of them revolve around the browser hacking.
295924	298145	It's just all web applets, so it's really stupid.
298485	300826	Suddenly, sales of Wipeout are incredibly popular.
300946	308708	MSN, or was it... Yeah, Microsoft, their messenger...
309420	310421	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
334113	335234	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
361497	364741	The PSP hacks so far have been pretty stupid, to be honest.
364842	367485	I mean, there hasn't been really anything cool.
367525	378239	There's been one that I saw that was kind of neat where you can put an external antenna on your Wi-Fi because I guess there's a little cord inside there that's actually just a Wi-Fi antenna and you can just
378888	380228	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
409697	415225	on a live journal or something, but then my fiance got there at the key, so I didn't get to.
416046	416407	All right.
417810	423391	My gaming week was kind of very similar to yours because I'm also in the process of moving right now, obviously.
424052	429173	So I don't really have any consoles hooked up right now, which is too bad because I wanted to check out how Halo 2 was going to be after the patches.
429193	433474	And I wanted to check out the brand new song pack that just came out for DDR Ultramix 2.
434414	435574	What new song pack?
435594	438275	Yeah, there was a new song pack that came out out of nowhere on Ultramix 2.
438495	439555	What songs do they have in that?
439995	442596	Waverer and Love This Feelin'.
443496	444237	Waverer?
444577	446097	It's like an old school song.
446380	448521	Waivers from Silent Hill.
449081	449381	Yeah.
449981	450181	Huh?
450582	451442	Yeah, crazy, huh?
451982	453663	Why are we talking about this on a normal show?
453823	455023	I totally forgot.
455603	455944	Oh.
456324	457944	I didn't even know the songs that came out.
457984	460245	Exclusive podcast material.
460285	461306	Exclusive, yeah.
461626	469969	You know, it's funny, ever since we made that change to saying we're not going to talk about rhythm and music games so much on the podcast, it seems to be we get a story every week now.
470908	471168	Oh, well.
471648	473869	Yeah, it's on Pac-10, so go check it out.
474249	477550	But, okay, so I've been wanting to play consoles, but I really just, you know, everything's in a box.
477570	479671	I don't want to, you know, hook it up and play.
480071	481291	So I've been playing DS.
481711	482991	Instead of PSP, I've been playing DS.
483272	483952	Mr. Driller.
485452	491454	I strangely, for some reason, when I first got my DS, I kind of plugged in the Metroid demo, and then I went, eh, and put it away.
491634	492614	I lost my demo.
492754	495135	I put it back in, and I'm playing the Metroid demo again.
495735	496396	It's pretty cool.
496696	498417	I'm looking forward to the full game.
499017	499618	Which is weird.
500038	505081	It's weird because I wasn't into Metroid First Person on the GameCube.
505401	507403	But for some reason on the DS it doesn't bug me at all.
507783	509164	I don't know if it's just because the controls are different.
509184	510745	It hurts the hell out of my hand.
511365	511666	I'm weird.
511986	512466	I don't know.
512506	514207	My hand cramps up from playing that game.
514267	517109	It's just because you have to hold it all weird and stuff.
517149	517369	Yeah.
518510	519190	I just don't like it.
519731	519991	All right.
520387	520527	May 14th
539674	543437	And as a reminder, that's going to be at Rockefeller Plaza in Midtown Manhattan.
544077	549121	And based on what they're going to be doing, they're going to be having a huge party the opening day and giving away prizes.
549181	551043	So if you're in the New York area, you might want to go check that out.
551063	552324	That's Saturday, May 14th.
552964	558348	And, of course, the facility will also be the home of the Pokemon Trading Card Game League.
558368	559729	Okay, that'll keep me away from that.
560450	561691	That and the fact that it's on the other side.
561711	564152	Well, there'll be plenty more to do than just Pokemon.
564172	565834	That's just one aspect of it.
566014	566534	Walk in.
566574	568676	You're going to walk into the store.
569136	570136	Doot, doot, doot, doot.
570156	571237	Seizure fever!
571397	571977	Woo!
573037	574157	Porygon!
575758	578258	Moving on to a news, something going on with the PSP.
578598	581219	You know how we've been getting a lot of UMD movies here?
581239	583259	It's starting to kind of pick up the format a little bit.
583659	586740	Now, Loki, you're somebody who actually works in the distribution industry.
586940	587300	Yeah.
587400	589141	Do you think UMDs are going to catch on?
589321	590181	They say they are.
591280	592862	I think it's stupid, to be honest.
592922	598229	I mean, I don't spend my money on fucking buying a portable system to bring games.
599170	601292	If you're buying the games, why do you need the UMDs?
601413	607480	I mean, you're never sitting down long enough to watch a whole friggin' movie, and by the time you do, your battery's spent.
608151	609451	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
635621	635981	Sort of.
636181	641164	Well, the story I wanted to read for you guys is that actually in Japan, they're going to be getting some new UMD movies.
641244	643405	What kind of American movies do you think are coming out in Japan?
644646	645106	Kill Bill?
645526	645787	Hitch?
646467	647067	Alright, here they are.
647127	648468	Here's the movies that are coming out in Japan.
648868	653631	On June 22nd, Sony Pictures Entertainment is going to be releasing 13 Ghosts.
654231	655052	You remember that movie?
655552	657173	Had the chick from American Pie in it?
657193	657793	Yeah, exactly.
658534	661695	13 Ghosts, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.
661855	662516	That's a good movie.
663436	664737	And Charlie's Angels.
665327	665787	I'm sorry.
666488	667529	I can see where that would fly.
667649	669090	Now, not the sequel, but the first one.
669130	670751	Charlie's Angels, the first one.
671212	672052	Get this, get this.
672773	673654	You got served.
675095	681080	And that's exactly what I'm saying to the Japanese PSP audience right now with that release.
681180	682681	They're importing American games.
683622	684242	Yeah, isn't that weird?
684282	687225	Because there's games here that aren't out there.
687525	688906	Of course, they have pack picks already.
689747	690707	Yeah, differences.
692689	692789	Eh.
693870	693930	Eh.
694929	696189	All right, I just thought I'd share that.
696289	701130	So if you think the movies we're getting here are a little weird, just remember, in Japan, they're getting You Got Served.
701150	703011	I'm still waiting for Smart Bomb to come out.
703231	703631	What's that?
704191	705751	It's a puzzle game for the PSP.
705771	707992	There's a lot of puzzle games coming out for different systems.
708012	708672	It got pushed back, though.
708772	709472	It's pretty cool.
709512	712213	It's sort of like... I don't really know how to describe it.
712233	713253	It's just a bunch of different puzzles.
714753	716714	It'd be like if you slowed down...
718092	721294	WarioWare, and have each puzzle last a little longer.
721755	722335	It was like that.
722856	725317	We are getting so many puzzle games in the different handhelds.
725858	729741	On the PSP, Mercury just came out recently, Luminous,
731740	734202	I might be mispronouncing that, but there's a new game coming out.
734242	734942	That's a puzzle game.
735283	738105	Sticky Balls is another game that's coming out on BSP.
738425	738866	Puzzle game.
739286	740007	Smart Bomb.
740307	741228	And that's the one you just mentioned.
741468	747533	And then on the DS, we're getting Electroplankton, Meteos, Polarium.
748013	750055	Electroplankton's not even really a game.
750115	752557	It's just like stuff happens.
753017	754438	I'm going to have Electroplankton.
754458	754819	I'm sorry.
755880	759843	Actually, the early reviews I'm reading on it say that it might be a little bit overrated.
761759	762700	We don't know yet.
763181	763921	I still want to see it.
763941	765283	I played Seaman, okay?
768106	769127	She played Seaman.
769148	772251	I used the American name, thank you.
774934	775435	Moving on.
776115	776715	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
796829	798450	What do you think this is going to mean for the future?
798710	805512	Basically, the reason why they're doing this, a lot of people see it as GameStop is buying their biggest competitor, but you have to think of it this way.
805552	808273	The biggest competitor, really, is Walmart.
809213	810473	That's their biggest competitor.
810573	820476	So what's happening is that GameStop and EB are kind of teaming up to take on Walmart, which I think is very interesting, and those very big super vendors, Best Buys and Targets, things like that as well.
821116	821757	What do you think of this?
822117	824237	When evil has purchased the greater evil.
827463	829323	And in other news, service still sucks.
831584	845726	What's interesting, if you take polls, if you go to different internet forums, because every gaming forum is lit up on this topic, it's like, it depends on the area you live, whether the EB store is better or the GameStop store is better.
846026	850647	And I think somebody was joking on the three-hour show this week that it's like the red states and the blue states.
851687	854688	It just depends on your neck of the woods, which store is better.
855028	856188	So people are very...
857199	859401	You know, it's almost like half and half.
860822	863144	Yeah.
863364	863684	Yeah.
864585	865226	They both suck.
866867	867908	They really, they both do.
867968	874233	I mean, I went to the mall, Arden Mall, and they had like, you know, I asked, do you have any PSP's?
874373	876215	No, you're never gonna find one.
876495	877095	Yeah!
877416	881559	And went to GameStop, you know, they gave me the same spiel, but the best part, oh look, there's a pile of them.
882600	883681	They've got them at Dan's store.
884021	884762	There you go.
885843	886263	So I said,
886618	887578	Fuck you, people.
888119	889099	You suck.
889479	890820	It's because you went to the mall.
891380	891941	I know.
892121	892621	I was over there.
894002	894842	Alright.
895422	896383	The Nintendo DS.
897243	898604	This is no surprise.
898864	899924	What new story?
899964	905147	If I said Nintendo was launching a brand new peripheral, what do you think it is?
906207	907488	Here in the US, finally.
908108	909289	They already had it in Japan.
910109	915352	Is it something that you can buy over and over and over again and still be suckered into buying another one?
915372	915432	Yes.
915712	915952	Yes.
917304	919967	I just wanted to let you know something.
942266	943506	There's actually a website out there.
943806	946327	Now, I don't remember the exact website URL.
946347	948407	Well, what a useful tip this is.
948827	949168	Shut up.
949248	962650	Anyways, it's basically you can get your Xbox, your PlayStation 2, your DS, or your Game Boy SP or whatever in any color you want.
963651	965571	You don't have to buy from Nintendo.
965591	965631	No.
966024	968965	You don't have to wait for them to come out with another color.
969045	970825	Those crappy stickers that you put on?
970865	972165	No, custom paint jobs.
972785	973406	Oh, gosh.
973826	975626	Pimp my DS, is that what this is?
976306	979167	Dude, maybe I can have camo.
979187	980407	But you can select which color.
980707	984548	Like, for the Xbox and PS2 systems, they come with controllers that match.
986208	993170	But it's like, seriously, people, you don't have to... This is something I would be expecting, like, you know, Paris Hilton to buy a system to match her purse or something.
993210	994290	She did buy a PSP.
994550	995190	Oh, shut up.
996021	998622	She probably went and had that gem crusting done to it, too.
1000643	1005544	Also in June, when the blue DS comes out, Nintendo's going to be putting out some DS games.
1006104	1006464	Yay.
1007045	1008165	Some pretty neat ones at that.
1008225	1008705	Meteos.
1008985	1010346	Meteos is one of them coming out in June.
1011006	1017528	And Kirby Canvas Curse, which implies it's going to be a Kirby game that uses a stylus.
1017808	1018508	Big surprise, huh?
1020049	1022950	When are we getting Mario Paint DS?
1022970	1023170	Yes.
1025934	1026234	I don't know.
1026814	1027475	That's what I want.
1027515	1028295	That would make sense.
1028315	1028795	That would be cool.
1029895	1030235	All right.
1030355	1034837	Well, there's the game in WarioWare, the mini game.
1035077	1035377	Yeah, I know.
1035397	1035957	It's not the same.
1038118	1040678	Yeah, but nothing beats the gelatin game.
1042279	1043259	The gelatin game is the best.
1043769	1053056	Alright, Orange Lounge Radio, we're not just here to talk about games, because if we talked about games all day long, we'd have no time to go terrorize children at the local arcade.
1053636	1063043	So, we're here to better your life, and what way better your life than to allow our very own DarkSakura to give you her advice column.
1063663	1064124	Oh, joy.
1066085	1067766	She's enthused about her own column.
1068327	1070448	What advice do you have for us tonight, DarkSakura?
1071129	1072690	I don't think enthused is a word.
1073809	1074389	Whatever.
1075850	1077090	Way to go, Grammarly.
1077110	1079270	Alright, thank you for that advice column.
1079310	1080531	We'll just end that segment.
1080971	1081471	You know what?
1081551	1082291	I have a favorite.
1083952	1085672	Alright, what's the advice column about tonight?
1086112	1088153	How to foil a UFO abduction.
1089493	1091513	Number one, do not panic.
1091994	1098755	The extraterrestrial biological entity, or EBE, may sense your fear and act rashly.
1099836	1101436	Two, control your thoughts.
1102008	1103929	Do not think of anything violent or upsetting.
1104009	1106929	The EBE may have the ability to read your mind.
1107570	1111411	Try to avoid mental images of abduction, boarding the saucer, or anal probes.
1112511	1116392	Such images may encourage... I knew an anal probe would come up somewhere in this.
1118012	1118953	Resist verbally.
1119373	1123374	Firmly tell the EBE to leave you alone.
1123534	1124614	No means no!
1125595	1126755	Resist mentally.
1127435	1130656	Picture yourself enveloped in a protective shield of white light.
1131187	1132268	or in a safe place.
1132488	1135371	Telepathic EBEs may get the message.
1135391	1135371	5.
1135811	1136672	Resist physically.
1137013	1140236	Physical resistance should only be used as a last resort.
1140296	1142218	Go for the EBE's eyes if it has any.
1142798	1146702	You will not know what its other more sensitive areas are.
1148243	1149705	But my final advice?
1149905	1150165	Yes.
1150786	1151727	Don't live in the Midwest.
1152367	1152768	Alright.
1152808	1156171	My final advice is, holy shit, if there's a fucking alien coming after you,
1156773	1159915	Honestly, poking the eye is going to piss the fucker off.
1160655	1169219	If I were the alien, because basically the aliens would look at us like bugs, I would throw you across the fucking room, smash you into a wall or something.
1169659	1172501	I mean, seriously, they could probably just crack you in half.
1174909	1177169	Besides, we know that there's no such thing as aliens.
1177209	1179210	Those are just weather balloons in tinfoil.
1179650	1180130	Swamp gas.
1180310	1181950	You got a real potty mouth tonight, you know that?
1182270	1183411	What's your point?
1184311	1184951	Moving on.
1185251	1188231	In fact, I feel like I need to cleanse this with something pure.
1188251	1189532	So we're going to talk about a pure story for a minute.
1189552	1194033	Honestly, if they want to abduct someone, we have plenty of people in Hollywood that are completely useless.
1194553	1195213	Just take them.
1195813	1197433	We have plenty of people in Washington, D.C.
1197453	1198393	that are completely useless.
1198713	1198893	Oh!
1199214	1199674	There you go.
1199734	1200754	It's one on each coast.
1200974	1201274	All right.
1201334	1201594	Anyway.
1202313	1207754	I feel like we need to cleanse Loki's potty mouth with a nice, pure, family-friendly story.
1207814	1208894	So... Grand Theft Auto?
1209174	1209315	No.
1211215	1216376	Namco, Home Tech, bought the rights to a very famous comic strip this week.
1217736	1218236	Any thoughts?
1218737	1220977	When I say wholesome and pure comic strip, what do you think?
1223157	1223718	Blondie?
1225258	1225438	No.
1227438	1230019	No, they bought the rights to The Peanuts.
1230752	1231512	Oh, that's right.
1231752	1232933	The Charlie Brown gang.
1233153	1234734	Well, Snoopy's really big.
1235074	1236955	Sanrio has a license for them, you know.
1237155	1250280	Yeah, well, Namco Home Tech announced that they are in agreement with United Media to create and publish games featuring characters from the Peanuts comic strip and all the other properties that go with that.
1250840	1252021	The deal will be good through 2009.
1252141	1253621	No details revealed yet.
1257699	1259560	about any possible games that are coming out.
1259640	1262320	But can you imagine some of the games that could come out for this?
1263241	1264681	The Great Pumpkin.
1265962	1268162	This year, the Great Pumpkin's gonna visit me.
1269823	1271203	I'm gonna wait here.
1271263	1277085	What kind of Charlie Brown games would you like to see on a console?
1277465	1279046	It's your video game, Charlie Brown.
1280746	1286768	I want to see a football game where Charlie Brown finally gets to stick it to Lucy and just beat her ass.
1287452	1288332	DarkSakura knows what's coming up.
1288352	1293073	A very famous website is creating content specifically for viewing on your PSP.
1295134	1295614	The website...
1316360	1328304	Playboy.com We'll be offering a science fiction themed pictorial of Amy Sue Cooper, who is the Playboy Cyber Girl of the Year 2005.
1330845	1332066	Cyber Girl of the Year.
1333726	1336347	This is content specifically for your PSP.
1337248	1340329	Two non-nude galleries and a video.
1341425	1352157	are going to be available on Playboy.com however the nude content will only be available exclusively through the Cyber Club program
1360447	1361148	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1375459	1378220	Really people, do you, it's just so pointless.
1378320	1384043	It's like, why do you need to download something you can see on your computer to your PSP?
1384403	1389086	I mean, there's like, you know, they're like, well, we're releasing, you know, PSP formatted video.
1389406	1392887	Yeah, you have to download the video from your computer to your PSP to watch it.
1393067	1399010	Because sometimes masturbation is not always something you do at the computer.
1400731	1402532	Don't you want those pictures to go?
1403692	1404033	No.
1404193	1404553	I don't know.
1405491	1406352	If you're into that.
1407373	1408414	Assuming you're into that.
1409635	1410756	Not that we endorse that.
1411696	1412477	Oh, man.
1414218	1421704	I'm sorry, but first off, folks, you're going to have to buy a larger memory card if you're going to want to do any of this crap to your PSP.
1423506	1425767	Really, why waste the time?
1426028	1429190	I mean, honestly, there's free porn out there.
1429771	1432193	It's all over the damn place.
1432373	1432653	I mean,
1433311	1434912	You really don't need to look far.
1435192	1439833	Alright, DarkSakura says our PSP space is better spent on other downloads from the internet.
1439873	1440293	Like what?
1440873	1449596	Like if you go to fans.gorillas.com on the news link, there is a little phrase there for the most recent update.
1450156	1455978	It says, for those of you with Sony PSPs, look for a very exclusive Gorillas download in the next 24 hours on this site.
1456558	1459339	So that means by Saturday, which...
1459969	1463652	I don't know when people are going to listen to this.
1463692	1467495	We're taping a couple days early, so Saturday will have already passed by the time people hear this.
1467515	1468876	There's downloadable content.
1468936	1472759	I would think that it would be either linked from the news site or from the multimedia link.
1472819	1476062	So if you're a fan of that music group, The Gorillaz, who have a new album coming out soon, yes?
1476302	1476742	Next month.
1476762	1477563	All right, very cool.
1477643	1478103	Demon Days.
1478203	1478724	Fangirl.
1479204	1479665	Fangirl.
1479885	1482727	Hopefully it will not suck like the Daft Punk.
1483512	1486794	Album Did, Prodigy, Crystal Method, Michael Jackson, Space Truckers
1510762	1515904	Halo 2 is going to have their brand new maps up on April 25th, so by the time most of you guys hear this, you'll be able to get this.
1515924	1520927	Two free maps are going to be available for download, Containment and Warlock.
1534825	1536786	Containment is a snow-based level.
1537146	1540528	Warlock is influenced by the original Halo map, Wizard.
1541208	1545090	And then you can download two more maps called Turf and Sanctuary.
1545170	1545570	It's going to be $6.
1547171	1548752	Other maps are going to come on June 28th.
1548772	1551893	So for those of you guys playing Halo Online, this is kind of cool.
1551913	1554054	This is something, you know, kind of mixed up a little bit.
1554094	1557876	So between the patch they just rolled out and this, you know, keeps Halo 2 fresh.
1557956	1558537	So good for them.
1560418	1563419	Hopefully none of those maps will suck as bad as the patch.
1564162	1576413	Battle mode maps in the latest Mario Kart game, including the wonderful map that was a square, another map that was almost a square, Mario shaped square, and some other crappy ones.
1577714	1577854	Sorry.
1577874	1578454	No, no, that's alright.
1578754	1584059	And I hope when their game patches, it patches better than Final Fantasy XI did this week, because oh my gosh.
1584239	1584940	Crap.
1584960	1586181	I got so frustrated.
1586241	1591145	I don't know if it has to do with those denial of service attacks that have been going on, but it took me
1591909	1593510	Thanks for watching!
1611943	1613964	Here's something else that's kind of interesting.
1614445	1619628	Sony Online Entertainment is going to be doing a new service called the Station Exchange.
1620029	1629535	And this is only rolling out for EverQuest 2, but what it is, this is very, very controversial, because the Station Exchange, this is something officially sanctioned by Sony, and guess what you do?
1630036	1633138	You can trade your items for real live money.
1633658	1635960	So it's basically endorsing...
1636897	1638297	Trading items for money in-game.
1638317	1640258	But they want to control it.
1640838	1641298	Exactly.
1641358	1641898	They want to control it.
1641918	1643378	They probably have a way to make a profit on it.
1643838	1644379	Oh, exactly.
1644419	1645279	I'm sure there's got to be.
1645839	1647119	So, it's interesting, though.
1647199	1650780	This is the very first time something like this has happened.
1651160	1652500	What do you guys think?
1653060	1655661	Should the company be endorsing this kind of behavior?
1655761	1657301	They're doing it to combat it.
1658061	1659722	The eBay-type sales.
1661222	1664663	It's probably not going to do much good, but we'll see.
1665043	1665583	That'll never work.
1665922	1677527	Well, the interesting thing is that they want to, and I think this is kind of clever, is that they're going to put the people who want to participate in this on separate servers than the people who don't want to participate in this.
1678207	1679748	So I think that's kind of interesting.
1680128	1683610	I don't know if that's going to work, but it's interesting nonetheless.
1686571	1688332	Interesting is a good word for it, yeah.
1688492	1692114	I have my issues with games like EverQuest 2 and World of Warcraft.
1692134	1692494	Please share.
1693325	1695467	where you have like 90 billion servers out there.
1696308	1698289	Some of these servers have player kills.
1698349	1700111	Some of these servers are all-out war.
1700171	1701412	Some of these servers are fun.
1701452	1704195	Some of these servers have, you know, auction, blah, blah, blah.
1704375	1705616	It's like, really, I mean...
1706478	1710080	Stop trying to appease everyone, because there's people who are going to be pissed off no matter what.
1710480	1712421	Just make a game that works.
1713022	1717864	Some of these people are so lazy, they need a type of command to order online pizza!
1718185	1724648	That's kind of why I kind of like Final Fantasy XI, because it's like, who cares if you and the Japanese guy speak different languages?
1724848	1726349	You play together, and you play nice.
1727810	1729270	Seriously, it needs to be like that.
1729591	1735674	Well, back in the days of Ragnarok Online, when I was playing on the Korean servers, when I couldn't talk to anybody...
1736345	1739427	because, oh, I'm sorry, my laptop doesn't handle Korean.
1740327	1741668	Well, not my laptop, but my keyboard.
1741868	1742089	Right.
1742349	1744730	You know, I was like, please speak English, please.
1745611	1747652	And then I had to type in emotes and everything.
1748092	1755537	And then when I was playing on the American server, well, the international server for a while, though, they have, like, the every other country server now.
1756658	1761100	And you had to be a bit tolerant because you'd be dealing with people from all over the world.
1761140	1761741	Exactly.
1761981	1765463	And they had really weird food items in that game being a Korean game.
1767085	1767565	Moving on.
1768085	1769166	Back to Rock was cool.
1771327	1774148	Except for all the... Help, please!
1774808	1776049	Spelled H-L-P-L-S.
1776089	1776809	Y'all, please.
1777029	1777809	Port, please.
1778730	1779230	P-L-Z.
1780991	1784972	I was hung out with this one priest who was really kind of pissy about the whole thing.
1784992	1786333	God, you make it sound like real life.
1787794	1789154	Okay, who's talking?
1789174	1790855	Yeah, I was hanging out with this priest.
1791866	1796948	We were questing together, we were like going out, we were clubbing, and then we walked into a bar.
1798668	1804330	There was this one person who was following us around the whole time, warped to Alberta or something.
1805670	1806430	Like Canada?
1807251	1808011	Yeah, like Canada.
1808791	1818494	So finally, the vine here opened a warp, and the person walked in, warped him to the haunted place.
1819674	1820155	Gas time.
1820435	1821555	Not the haunted place.
1822410	1822691	Yeah.
1822831	1823231	Mexico?
1824813	1825334	Anyway.
1825734	1826075	No.
1827096	1827917	Moving on.
1828077	1831161	If you guys ever have a comment on our show, we'd love to hear from you guys.
1831221	1834104	Also, if you have any questions you want to ask us on the podcast, hey, why not?
1834464	1839831	Our email address, togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeloungeradio.com, all one word there.
1840031	1841693	This is our website where you're at it, orangeloungeradio.com.
1842914	1843274	That's scary.
1843354	1845335	This is going to be used against me if I run for president.
1845375	1845655	That's funny.
1845675	1847115	I'm saving one of our best stories here for the end.
1869947	1871808	New Zelda details.
1871888	1878392	The new Zelda game that's coming out on the Nintendo GameCube, which makes all the fanboys squee with glee about this one.
1878873	1879253	And girls.
1881454	1890460	Spanish games publication Javi Consolas has leaked some information about the new Zelda, or at least is putting information in their magazine.
1891259	1896041	They're basically saying that it's going to be a 70-hour game.
1896441	1897281	That's a long time.
1898062	1901383	It's supposed to be a world that's even bigger than Ocarina of Time.
1902543	1906005	Supposedly it's supposed to be about two or three times larger, in fact.
1907105	1907865	Very interesting.
1907945	1912087	And some of the new outfits include Link being like a peasant style.
1913530	1921732	And then they even have some screenshots, one showing a Triforce that's kind of tattooed or emblazed on his hand.
1922072	1922853	So very interesting.
1922873	1925913	Well, that's because the Triforce was tattooed on his hand.
1925933	1928694	But just that amount of detail is very cool.
1929854	1931055	And he also becomes a ninja.
1932695	1934376	Curse you, Trogdor!
1934476	1935516	I mean, Ganon!
1936995	1941738	Um, there's, um, some villages that are like several zones big as well.
1941758	1947482	There was another demo where Link, uh, battles a horde of monsters while riding the horse.
1948062	1952145	Um, you can choose between Link's sword or Link's bow to take down the riders.
1952625	1954046	So, uh, it's kind of neat.
1954106	1956628	And the bow no longer has an infinite range.
1956868	1958309	It only has a limited range on it.
1958349	1959710	So, interesting.
1962071	1964273	Uh, the Z targeting is back for the enemies.
1964413	1965013	They did mention that.
1965053	1965694	That's awesome.
1966154	1966234	So,
1967188	1967708	We shall see.
1967788	1972569	Except now, since GameCube doesn't really have a Z trigger, it's now L targeting.
1972729	1973250	It's the L button.
1975090	1982452	Lastly, for you guys tonight, a story about another GameCube game, and I know you guys are excited about this.
1983472	1988854	Namco has announced for the GameCube Hello Kitty Roller Rescue.
1991114	1994155	Does she show me the 42 pressure points of death?
1994895	1995595	I don't think so.
1995675	2001498	However, she will be rendered in full 3D along with her Sanrio character friends.
2001978	2014705	In Roller Rescue, Hello Kitty and her friends must save Sanrio Town from an alien invasion because the king of the block planet, Blocko, is going to send troops to Earth to liberate.
2014725	2016405	Stop, stop, hold on a second.
2016806	2018706	Blocko, wasn't that from Gumby?
2019327	2020267	I don't know, I don't know.
2020627	2021868	Those were the block heads.
2022233	2024375	Gumbi, Popeye, Peanuts, Hello Kitty
2042915	2045897	Yeah, but Sanrio already had licenses to... Oh my god.
2045917	2049339	Dude, they need to do like a Super Smash Brothers with all these characters.
2049540	2050380	I got it right now.
2050580	2052702	Franchise fighting revolution.
2052942	2053762	No, you know what?
2053802	2057165	We're going to get another Super Robot Wars starring Hello Kitty.
2057185	2065691	Oh my god, they need to remake that game that was by Sega where you had like, you know, the Daytona car fighting a cactus fighting... Fighters Mega Mix.
2065751	2067111	Yeah, Fighters Mega Mix.
2067131	2067772	It was awesome.
2067872	2072075	It was all about playing with the two random Sonic fighters people.
2073261	2075002	I actually have Fighters Megamix.
2075663	2076083	That's cool.
2077124	2079025	Alright, that's going to do it for another podcast.
2079065	2080006	Final thought, Loki?
2081406	2083628	I don't want to pack anymore.
2086009	2086290	Shut up.
2086670	2087350	Packing, huh?
2087911	2089272	I'm packing boxes.
2089332	2096316	I need to fill them full of my wonderful computer parts and junk.
2096836	2098778	My final thought is beef.
2100179	2100719	DarkSakura.
2101423	2103584	Reject false icons.
2104264	2105564	Set Britney Spears on fire!
