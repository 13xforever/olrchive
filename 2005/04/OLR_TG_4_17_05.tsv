3525	14276	You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
14536	18039	Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
19881	22604	Yes, here we are again for another edition of...
23786	51466	The Orange Lounge Radio To Go Podcast Where we talk about what's going on in the gaming world This is a podcast dedicated to what gamers really want to know about So we don't talk about games that suck Well, okay, sometimes they come up occasionally NASCAR 2005 My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky The voice you hear over there is the lovely Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers Ego++ And of course joining us as always is Loki
52110	52790	Hi.
53150	53450	Hello.
53711	55091	You're very tired, aren't you, Loki?
55191	56031	Very tired.
56051	57572	And why is it that you're pretty tired this week?
57812	58312	Moving.
58812	59613	Sucks.
59653	65975	For those of you guys who are listening to the Sunday night show, the three-hour program, it was kind of a sappy show this week because... It was full of pants.
66535	71677	Well, it was our kind of goodbye to the studio as we evolve.
72057	73598	Orange Lounge Radio is kind of evolving.
73618	75198	This podcast is a big part of that.
75539	78520	We're taking Orange Lounge Radio, our internet station we do on Live365...
79904	83045	Best of Live 365 Nominated Broadcaster of the Year.
83125	84325	We're very excited about that.
84365	85665	Those awards happen in a couple weeks.
85985	86625	So we're excited about that.
87725	93266	We're taking our station on Live 365 and kind of revamping it to be a general video gaming station.
93326	94867	This podcast is a big part of that.
95167	97327	Again, DDR fans shouldn't be too upset.
97387	100868	We're still going to have Rhythm of Music Games be a big part of that.
101488	104848	But I believe, DarkSakura, you said this a couple weeks ago, and I think it describes this whole thing best.
105229	107949	We are gamer fans first, DDR fans second.
108772	109895	Yeah, that's pretty much it.
109935	114086	Because DDR is a game, so we're gamer fans before anything else.
114366	120610	DDR is a subcategory of the gamer thing.
121051	126334	So this podcast we do is kind of the kickoff of that, dedicated to other gaming things, and we're all here.
126615	129296	All three of us are here live in person in studio.
129356	132058	Somebody had asked a question a while back, do you Skype in any of your co-hosts?
132318	132799	Actually, we don't.
132859	135901	We are all here live in the flesh so we can interact with each other.
136061	140124	I'm actually an artificial intelligent program here that just acts like me.
140944	142305	We've nicknamed him Simone.
142746	143026	All right.
143386	144307	Anyway, let's get to it.
144347	146649	What's your game of the week been like, DarkSakura?
146669	147569	I ain't played shit.
148190	148510	Really?
149031	152593	No, actually, I did play something, now that I think about it.
152654	155216	I played the Jeep Simulator on the Gorillaz site.
155716	157097	You and your web games.
157177	169367	It's fun, because if anyone has seen the 19-2000 video, they're on this big stretch of a highway being chased by aliens and salvation and things like that.
170067	173168	and you can actually drive the whole freeway that they're on.
173388	176470	Okay, promise me this week you'll tarry yourself on the website to play another game.
176610	178090	You've got a house full of games.
178370	180371	I played Legos too.
180651	181852	Oh yeah, you played the Lego game.
181912	196678	I played the Star Wars Lego game and it was really cool because we got enough money in the game to unlock General Grievous and the next Star Wars movie he's supposed to have killed these four Jedi and uses their lightsabers as his damn weapons and he's got four arms.
196758	197398	It's really rad.
197418	197818	Yeah.
198263	201844	So he's like kicking ass all the time and I'm over there using like Anakin.
203045	203585	All right.
203665	205365	Hi, I'm evil.
205465	206026	No spoilers.
206466	207346	Hi, I'm Vader.
208907	209207	All right.
210187	210607	Anything else?
210707	211327	Just the Lego game?
212108	213468	That's kind of it.
213848	214128	Yeah.
214148	216549	Well, I'm glad you were able to tear yourself away to at least give that a try.
216609	217029	I'm curious.
217069	218230	I've been busy with school.
218270	219190	I had a lot of crap up.
219410	221411	I'm not huge on Star Wars.
221471	225432	I respect the films, but I'm not like, oh my God, I wet my pants, Revenge of the Sith.
226752	227592	You know, they're cool games.
228333	234498	There's some good games that come out of the series, so I'm curious about this Lego... I think it's kind of hilarious, the whole concept, Lego meets Star Wars.
234738	236840	I think it's the dumbest thing I've ever seen.
237140	239622	It was really stupid-looking, but it was fun.
240283	242344	Fun is what games are all about, though.
242424	242905	Okay, good.
242925	246167	Make a fun game that could be Star Wars, not featuring Legos.
246287	252072	Intelligent Cube was a stupid-looking game, because it was like, oh, these falling cubes, but it's one of the most brilliant PlayStation games they ever did.
252092	253133	Rogue Squadron was fun.
253733	255714	This is why you don't see Tickle Me Elmo the game.
255734	256894	I mean, that would be stupid.
257174	259655	But that still doesn't stop them from putting Mary-Kate and Ashley games out.
259775	260035	Uh-huh.
260415	261595	Loki, what's your game of the week been like?
262496	264976	I played Luminous, and I played Ridge Racer for the PSP.
266617	269077	And they're fun.
269738	270238	Lots of fun.
270298	278660	Ridge Racer's pretty cool because it's like a throwback to the old R4, which is the best one, I think, that was available for the original PlayStation.
279212	282415	and then they have R5 tracks in there as well.
282756	285238	Those are pretty good.
285278	289442	I guess you can unlock the intros for both of those games as well.
290203	290884	It's just a lot of fun.
291304	292585	Got to play it against my boss.
293186	294547	Kicked his ass by 10 seconds.
295849	297791	I had never actually played the game when I played him.
299292	300033	He's not that much.
300053	301194	I mean, he's a gamer, but
302174	304775	He's probably just not as hardcore as I am.
305615	305895	Oh well.
306155	310015	And then Luminous is interesting.
310216	315396	It's so simple, but you can kind of screw yourself up pretty easy on it.
315977	317097	So it's interesting.
317117	318697	It's just something you've got to play, I guess.
319197	322638	And then I also put Robot Chicken, five episodes of it, on my PSP.
323178	324398	Doing the hacksaw thing?
324578	325218	Lead hacksawing?
325238	325758	Not really.
325898	328839	I mean, it's a feature of the PSP to put video on it, so that's what I did.
329744	331124	All right.
331444	337386	You know, my gaming week was kind of similar, where I actually played Donkey Konga this week over at my buddy's house.
337406	339887	We were playing Donkey Konga, and I haven't played Donkey Konga a whole lot.
339947	341647	Like, maybe this is like my second or third time playing it.
342007	343908	But I was playing all the crazy songs.
344028	347269	It's kind of like how Loki was kicking ass at Ridge Racer his first time playing it.
347569	357572	Just because I've played so many of the rhythm beat games, and since I'd played Taiko no Tatsujin before, which is Taiko Drum Master, which is basically the same thing as Donkey Konga, just in a different setup.
358112	361554	I had no problem clearing the difficult songs, so they were going like, how are you doing that?
361594	362635	Your second time playing?
362675	363975	Oh my god, what's wrong?
365516	372540	Also during my gaming week, I also played a little bit of Luminous, which, wow, that game is just, it really is as amazing as everybody says it is.
372620	373941	It's so addicting.
374802	382966	It's seizure-inducing at times, but once you get the hang of it, there's some very good, I would highly recommend over on GameFacts.com, GameFAQs.com,
384647	391670	They have some luminous facts, and you wouldn't think that a puzzle game would need it, but when you read it, it really improved my game.
391770	398453	I was not able to get past the second skin, but then when I read the FAQs, I was up to, like, skin number 10 on my next game.
398533	400554	So I highly recommend checking that out.
400594	402975	And I have not been able to get the song Shinin' out of my head.
403035	406377	That's the song that plays in the first stage, the Mato Grosso song.
406997	408458	You'll be shinin' to do...
409438	410199	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
431812	437097	This is posted on PSPHacks.blogspot.com.
437537	439599	It's the PSP Home Control version 1.0.
441180	448326	And it's actually a way that you can control your DVD player, TiVo, and high-definition television all from your PSP.
448386	449467	It's what some guy did.
450408	452670	He made graphics in Photoshop and everything.
453311	453911	Crazy.
454051	456492	He's actually controlling devices using his PSP.
457932	459153	Not something for everybody.
459173	461273	Of course, it's using the wipeout hacks to be able to do this.
461653	467615	Not something for everybody, but certainly shows the potential the PSP has as a device.
467715	472656	If it can do this with a little bit of tweaking, it's only a matter of time before some of these features come into the mainstream.
472676	473496	So this is kind of neat.
474296	479398	One of the things that's actually pretty cool that's coming out later on is a game where you can actually make your own game.
479938	480398	Sort of the
480865	484007	Memory cards and then probably upload it to the internet and all that wonderful fun stuff.
484027	487290	Oh, that's going to unleash a whole other community upon itself.
487330	487950	That's going to be interesting.
487990	489992	It's like the RPG makers or fighter makers.
490072	492054	Or ZZT if you want to get really old school.
492094	493495	But, oh my god.
494195	497258	Port that to the... Oh, please somebody.
497858	500680	Stop porting Linux and start porting ZZT.
500720	505004	Why the hell... If you have any idea what I'm talking about, please port ZZT to the PSP.
505664	506585	Too many acronyms, I know.
506705	507866	Eh, put Linux on your toaster.
509884	517567	Anyway, if you want to check that out again, it's psphacks.blogspot.com Moving on, Halo 2 is going to be getting a big update this week.
517667	521969	This Monday, Bungie is putting out a brand new patch for Halo 2.
522029	526911	This is going to be pretty big because they're actually going to alter the way some of the weapons work.
526931	529692	They're going to be doing some changes with the melee damage.
529892	532453	They're going to be changing the way grenades work a little bit.
532513	537695	The fuse timer is going to be tightened up a little bit and the damage caused is going to be increased.
538295	540077	They're just changing some other things here and there.
560697	562077	Too many hacks out there right now.
562717	569298	Too many people taking abuse of the glitches that are on there right now that have falsified the leaderboards.
569358	570059	It's one aspect.
570119	571319	It's a pretty big answer here.
571359	574119	I'd urge you guys to check it out if you're a Halo fan over at Bungie.net.
576120	580200	But they're basically going to reset to give everyone a fair shot since they are tweaking the rules.
580240	587061	Although they say to the casual player, which would be me, I think I fall in this category because I suck at Halo, you won't even notice the difference.
587562	590022	Something the hardcore players are going to notice the difference in.
591428	593890	I bet neither of you care because you don't play Halo at all, do you?
594350	595491	Halo makes me throw up.
595811	596552	I like Halo.
596632	598513	I like Halo, but it makes me motion sick.
599154	601255	Ah, so you don't throw up because you hate the game.
601315	609841	I literally get so motion sick that I would like to, you know, remove the contents of my lunch from my stomach and offer it to the porcelain goddess on my knees.
612023	613764	Loki, you're just not, eh.
615045	617567	I mean, I don't own the game, I don't own Xbox.
619068	619488	Yay!
619709	623993	Alright, then let's talk about a story I do know you would know something about, Loki.
624093	628577	Final Fantasy XI had some news this week because they are under attack!
629381	631762	Somebody is DDoSing them.
631822	640605	This is also known as the denial of service attacks, where basically somebody is trying to overload the servers with information so that they effectively shut down.
640905	642166	And I can personally attest to this.
642266	645647	I had problems logging in on, I think it was like Tuesday night, I was trying to log in.
645967	648648	Remember, you were playing and I was going to try to join you in a party.
649368	650169	Loki, I couldn't get in.
650189	650709	This is why.
650829	652309	Somebody was DDoSing the servers.
653070	653570	Squeenix!
654503	658665	As we fondly refer to them here on the show, they're putting the smack down.
659145	664368	They're saying that they have notified law enforcement authorities in Japan, the United States, and Europe.
664755	672339	The attack started April 9th, and as of the taping of this podcast, they're still ongoing as far as we know, causing latency and screwy servers.
672679	674380	So they're not happy about that.
674581	679443	Is this just some World of Warcraft person that's just pissed off or something?
679563	682325	Probably one of those people that got banned for selling Gil on eBay.
682525	683766	Yeah, I was going to say, who would do this?
683826	686507	Who would have the motive to DDOS Final Fantasy XI?
686547	690009	Because honestly, how many servers are there for Final Fantasy XI?
690029	691350	There's at least 20 servers.
692117	693718	You're not going to shut the whole game down.
693758	699101	You would have to have the entire force of America Online DDoSing these people to shut it down.
699121	700001	That's not going to happen.
700061	702602	So what do people have to gain from this, do you think?
702662	706785	And also each server is just... A server is not necessarily one computer either.
706805	707665	That's true.
707845	708966	It's like a cluster of them.
710667	715009	That's why you'll see a group of people drop and not everybody...
716155	717416	IRC, you know, type of thing.
717536	718156	What do you think this is?
718196	719596	Disgruntled gill seller?
719956	720817	World of Warcraft fan base?
720837	725378	It's just some loser kid that's trying to, like, I don't know, feel special.
725398	727279	Someone who's playing Rose Online.
728099	729340	Well, stop screwing up my game.
730320	731060	That's what I have to say.
733221	733861	Moving on.
734722	735002	Kind of...
735615	735795	But... But...
763542	764903	It's starring The Rock.
765063	766243	Yes, it is starring The Rock.
766263	767124	Dude, that's cool.
767544	771786	And Carl Urban, who is in Lord of the Rings, Return of the King, and Born Supremacy.
772107	778690	The director of this movie, Andrzej Bartokwek, I hope I... I know I totally mispronounced that, so I apologize.
779190	782172	But he directed the movies Cradle to the Grave and Exit Wounds.
782652	783953	So, should be interesting.
784013	786074	We, like, have, like, some, you know...
786874	788775	We're the hip-hop artists in this movie.
788795	792636	Yeah, I was going to say, didn't both those movies star hip-hop stars?
792676	794177	I know one of them starred 50 Cent.
794197	796638	We're getting thug-doomed, that's it.
796998	801580	And then they're going to be having some hip-hop interlude action sequence or something like that.
801620	802120	Doom, yo.
804731	809073	This is cool if you're into art, modern art especially, and gaming.
809113	811754	And I know this is one that might hit home for you, DarkSakura.
812694	815496	They're going to be doing an 8-bit art exhibit.
815856	817837	It's going to open April 19th.
817937	821058	That's this week on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood.
821098	821859	It's at Gallery 1988.
821979	828122	And the expo is running April 19th through May 20th.
828202	831683	And that is perfectly timed up so that it's running through the last day of E3.
831864	832704	It's opening on my birthday.
833191	833972	Very cool, yes.
834452	839775	And so basically they're going to be hosting a party for E3 attendees as well on May 18th.
840196	843778	It's game-related art from more than 100 artists.
843898	847000	The gallery is called I Am 8-Bit.
848421	850542	I bet there's got to be some Amano art there.
850722	851683	This is what's cool about it.
851723	857467	The opening will be hosted by Gerardo, also known as Rico Suave.
859053	859574	8-Bit Weapon
873707	875048	We saw those guys at Classic Gaming Expo.
875068	877868	I bought one of their albums and did a marathon on my show.
877948	878609	They're going to be there.
878949	879809	So check that out.
880769	884610	The art will be based on games Pac-Man, Street Fighter 2, Dig Dug.
884890	887331	They've got digital prints, paintings, sculpture.
887931	890752	This is going to be just awesome.
890872	900074	One of the exhibits will be The Mourning of the Princess by Ryan Bubness and it depicts an unshaven chain-smoking link from The Legend of Zelda.
902015	902095	Um
902788	916698	Tim Tomkinson made an artwork called Duck Hunter S. Thompson, which will feature the author, Hunter S. Thompson, who made Fear and Loathing Las Vegas, wrote that original story, over a backdrop of the NES light gun classic.
918119	919059	Very interesting.
919500	922261	I want to check this out when I'm down in LA for E3.
922301	923322	Definitely have to.
923582	925223	Yeah, we've got to plan a trip to that.
925284	925824	That's going to be cool.
926815	934417	All right, speaking of E3, Ubisoft has revealed some of the titles they are going to be showing at E3, which includes some next-gen.
934817	935657	So that's very cool.
935697	942638	Some of the next-gen games are going to be showing Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon 3 and Peter Jackson's King Kong.
942658	944799	You know how they're remaking King Kong this year?
944839	946319	Peter Jackson, the guy who did Lord of the Rings.
946339	949960	They're going to be making games, and they will be on the next-gen systems.
950040	955781	So we're finally starting to see... Now, they haven't said which next-gen systems, but a next-gen system, so...
956420	958363	We're finally starting to hear some of the games that are coming out.
958663	961246	What kind of games do you guys hope make it to the next-gen systems?
963289	964050	More Tekken.
965071	965511	Tekken.
965692	966413	Next-gen Tekken.
967194	967394	Loki?
969185	974467	Um, next gen systems, next gen, next gen.
974847	977647	How about, well, we know Grand Theft Auto is going to be there.
977727	979268	We need more Katamari Damacy.
979748	986269	Oh, I want to see, I want to see, even though I really want Silent Hill 5, I want to see that.
987030	989790	I want to see more original stuff like Katamari Damacy.
989810	992471	I hope that all these special next gen things will...
993672	997115	I just wanna see more original games like Katamari Damacy.
997135	998356	I just wanna see original stuff.
1020867	1024110	Use this fancy new next-gen technology you're developing to make something new.
1024150	1025471	We need more treasure games.
1026331	1026912	Treasure games?
1027252	1028293	Our pirate hunting games?
1028313	1030915	No, Treasure brought us Gunstar Heroes.
1031035	1032356	Oh, the company treasure.
1032376	1033277	Chameleon Twist.
1034197	1037260	They freaking brought us Silhouette Mirage.
1038761	1041623	We need more treasure games, because treasure is awesome.
1042819	1044519	Or as my friend says, Treshar.
1045140	1047680	Well, do you know what gaming company is cool?
1048280	1049780	At least according to themselves.
1050321	1055982	Majesco, creators of the game Phantom Dust on Xbox, among other things.
1056422	1059342	They are changing their NASDAQ stock symbol.
1059362	1060463	This would be the stock exchange.
1060483	1065444	They're changing it from M-J-E-S to C-O-O-L.
1066664	1067464	Oh, funny.
1068384	1071745	So Majesco just wants everybody to know they're cool.
1072498	1073258	Aren't they special?
1075519	1076520	I just think that's kind of interesting.
1076540	1079561	They're not as cool as Namco!
1079581	1081402	Or several other gaming companies I can think of.
1081842	1084103	One of them being Konami, one of our favorites.
1085324	1089046	Konami just picked up another gaming publisher.
1089586	1091607	Hudson Soft, Konami has picked up.
1091667	1092547	Bomberman!
1092607	1094068	Yep, the makers of Bomberman.
1094428	1095529	The games with the Bs.
1096349	1097730	You may also know Hudson Soft as.
1097890	1100011	They made, what, Adventure Island back in the day?
1100251	1100631	Yeah, yeah.
1100919	1103560	I'm not sure what they've done recently outside of Bomberman, I have to admit.
1104340	1113945	But Konami and Hudson, they issued a joint statement saying that April 27th, Konami is going to purchase 3 million shares of Hudson's stock.
1114325	1117966	This means that Konami will become the majority stakeholder.
1118026	1122428	So they're not quite fusing per se, but... It's a takeover.
1122488	1123309	Yeah, pretty much.
1124909	1126470	You know it's heading in that direction.
1127330	1129111	Alright, Orange Lounge Radio.
1129151	1135073	We're not just here to fill you in on the latest and greatest in gaming news, but we're also here to better your life.
1135133	1143436	Because, you know, if all we did is played video games all day, we wouldn't have any time to go out and, you know, get some culture.
1144417	1144997	See art shows.
1145657	1146878	Hey, I did that today.
1147578	1150059	So we encourage you to get out once in a while and...
1151736	1155899	Dark Sakura brings you her advice column every single week.
1156059	1157880	Dark Sakura, what are you going to be talking about tonight?
1159342	1161663	How to navigate a minefield.
1163405	1161663	1.
1164045	1166107	Keep your eyes on your feet.
1166127	1166107	2.
1166627	1167088	Freeze.
1167228	1168569	Do not move any farther.
1169570	1168569	3.
1170090	1174814	Look for spikes, detonators, wires, bumps, or discoloration in the ground around you. 4.
1176576	1181518	Avoid wires, bumps, or discoloration on the ground, and back up slowly in your own footsteps.
1181778	1183159	Do not turn around.
1183359	1184319	Walk backwards.
1185100	1187120	But you know what I always say in situations like that?
1187380	1187641	What?
1188641	1190642	Don't freaking go to Eastern Europe.
1192903	1194303	Avoid those minefields altogether.
1195044	1195424	Indeed.
1195824	1196064	All right.
1197315	1201916	Moving on in gaming news, you know there's a big movie coming out this summer, The Fantastic Four.
1202216	1203297	They're adapting that comic book.
1203317	1204557	Are you a fan of The Fantastic Four?
1204757	1205637	I was at one time.
1206298	1207658	I remember The Fantastic Four in the 80s.
1207678	1209518	I remember the last movie that came out.
1211599	1214780	Well, Activision is actually making a Fantastic Four game.
1215593	1219336	And they've actually been recruiting some musicians to be on the soundtrack.
1219656	1223279	We're going to have The Explosion with a song called I'm On Fire.
1223319	1224580	This is not the soundtrack to the movie.
1224600	1225981	This is the soundtrack to the game.
1226921	1229723	Jurassic 5 with a song called Clobberin' Time.
1230504	1231464	Go Betty Go.
1231545	1233486	It's an all-girl punk rock band if you don't know who they are.
1233906	1239487	Everywhere, and ModRockers Taking Back Sunday will be bringing up Error Operator.
1239787	1244768	Now, the interesting thing is that the songs all kind of go with one of the characters.
1245188	1256151	Error Operator for Mr. Fantastic, the girl punk rock group Everywhere for the Invisible Woman, Jurassic 5 doing the song for The Thing, and I'm on Fire, of course, the Human Torch.
1256491	1260231	But how can a song called Clobber in Time not be for The Thing?
1261352	1262072	I don't know, I don't know.
1262312	1263452	That's his catchphrase.
1264446	1268055	So that's just kind of cool that they've got little songs to go with each character.
1268115	1269138	That's just cute.
1270200	1272065	There's really no other way I can describe that, I'm sorry.
1274363	1275343	Pac-Man's coming back.
1275463	1277484	Pac-Man is going to be on the DS.
1277524	1280865	It seems like we get a new Pac-Man game of some type every year, just something crazy.
1281125	1282886	This is actually not the Pac-Pix game, though.
1282906	1283566	This is something different.
1283586	1286627	It's called Pac-N-Roll, and it's coming out on the DS.
1286687	1289709	So I, for one, am impressed that there's actually a new game coming out on the DS.
1289889	1292229	Is this that one that I was crazy about at the E3 demo?
1292309	1293490	No, that was the Pac-Pix one.
1293510	1294270	This is a little bit different.
1294290	1301893	This is Pac-N-Roll, and what Pac-N-Roll does is that you basically play a rounded Pac-Man, and you go around colorful worlds.
1302313	1308140	You use the DS touchscreen and stylus, so it's kind of like you're running Pac-Man through 3D worlds.
1308720	1309441	So that's kind of neat.
1310362	1312765	So pack and roll, we'll be using, of course, the stylus.
1312865	1314387	You kind of roll it around there with that.
1314487	1315929	So it's kind of like the trackball thing.
1316089	1317190	That's the one I was wanting.
1317558	1320601	Oh, I thought you were talking about the one where you actually draw the Pac-Man.
1320661	1322102	Oh, my bad, my bad.
1322142	1324444	I was all about the Marble Madness looking game.
1324584	1337394	Now, when you went and saw the DS at E3, did you get to go... Remember E3 last year, they had the cool line, like random people got to go in the cool line that would see all the games, and some people got to go in the not-so-cool line where they only saw WarioWare?
1337634	1338755	That was the one I ended up being in.
1338775	1339716	I sort of snuck over.
1339876	1340597	Oh, you snuck over?
1340697	1342378	So that's how you saw this, because I didn't see this.
1343119	1344139	I saw the Pac-Pix, though.
1344300	1345380	And I also saw a...
1346773	1348994	A picture that someone snuck.
1350815	1351235	Scandalous.
1351476	1351796	All right.
1353036	1353897	Very interesting.
1353997	1358839	Pack and Roll will include the original Pac-Man arcade game, just for the heck of it.
1359340	1363442	Because just like Linux, Pac-Man has to show up on every system available out there.
1363962	1364522	Indeed.
1365603	1366183	What can you say?
1366243	1368224	It's the granddaddy of video games.
1369801	1370422	One of the granddaddies.
1370442	1374805	Where's the Gradius game that we saw at friggin' E3 last year for the DS?
1374945	1375826	That's what I wanna know.
1376006	1377247	Seriously, I wanna see that too.
1377267	1378087	You know what we need?
1378608	1380649	What the whole Gradius series needs?
1381370	1382431	A new Parodius.
1383452	1384452	Oh, that'd be great.
1384813	1386174	Or like KO Flying Squadron 2.
1387635	1388455	Actually, there was one.
1388516	1390057	We need like a new KO Flying Squadron.
1390677	1391578	Or a new Cotton game.
1393396	1399481	We have some news tonight, lastly, about the, actually, no, not lastly, almost lastly, Next Gen Xbox.
1400602	1401643	It's a couple stories here.
1401963	1405326	One of these stories has to do with Tetsuya Mitsugushi.
1406106	1410350	He's the guy who helped out with Space Channel 5 and Rez.
1411891	1414293	He didn't just help out, he actually produced these games.
1414894	1419117	He actually announced recently that he's going to be doing games for the Next Gen Xbox.
1419517	1420298	But here's the thing.
1420865	1423207	They will not be music-oriented titles.
1423768	1424849	That's a big title coming out this week.
1424869	1433718	That's kind of a surprise when you consider that Space Channel 5 and Rez are right there, probably the two most underrated music titles of all time.
1434098	1435400	Rez had the vibrator thingy.
1435560	1437702	Yeah, he's going trans-vibrator all the way.
1438863	1441726	So hopefully whatever he does will be with the vibration still, huh?
1444316	1452483	He has commented in a recent interview that he sees the next generation consoles not just new machines, but as the point of a major shift in gaming history.
1452823	1456386	He says, I believe that we are at a historical turning point in gaming.
1456787	1464313	If we were to look back at today and the not too distant future, I believe that we will be saying to ourselves, ah, so that was the first step that led to the major changes.
1464934	1470459	This time, the Xbox will fit not four, but six family members inside of it.
1472016	1477278	Have you been following the, what's that called, that Xbox thing, the online?
1477298	1478178	The ARG.
1478298	1478778	Yes, the ARG.
1478918	1479779	The alternate reality game.
1479799	1481139	Yeah, have you been following that at all?
1481159	1482399	The Colony, is that what they're calling it?
1482820	1485541	Yeah, thecolony.net or something like that.
1485861	1491382	Yeah, I have this wonderful web board that I read called nonfiction.com.
1492063	1494964	They do all the work for me, and I just watch it from afar.
1495444	1496924	Kind of like what I do with Metacortex.
1497284	1499425	I watched it from afar, and that's what I'm doing now.
1500029	1507134	So they showed, what was it, first we found out that the official name for it is going to be the Xbox 360.
1507854	1513878	That it has a really retarded looking white controller for it that's all shiny and it's got some stupid ball on it.
1513898	1514879	It looks like a trackball.
1515019	1516060	It's pure and virginal.
1516960	1517440	Yeah, whatever.
1517521	1522124	Anyways, then also the console system is rumored to look like one of those stupid...
1523399	1524500	Thanks for watching!
1542334	1545055	You know, we need to get rid of these console systems.
1545235	1548376	Xbox is like, hey, we can stick our Xbox inside of those things.
1548436	1549777	And boom, there you go.
1549817	1551277	I'm still getting email for the Phantom.
1551338	1552378	Whatever happened to the Phantom?
1552398	1553498	I thought the Phantom was supposed to be out by now.
1553518	1554459	I'm still getting email for them.
1554659	1555459	Oh, it's coming out.
1555779	1557160	And you know what the title game is going to be?
1557520	1558500	Duke Nukem Forever.
1558520	1560821	No, I'm just kidding.
1561081	1561721	Oh, it's a joke.
1561801	1562302	Oh, I get it.
1562902	1563522	It was a funny joke.
1563682	1565703	Because they're both never going to ever come out.
1565743	1566103	I get it.
1567504	1571045	Well, speaking of the Xbox 360s, analysts are saying...
1572147	1582592	3 million Xboxes could possibly be shipped by Christmas, especially if the system is targeted under $300, which is where they are targeting this new system to be at.
1582612	1584733	It will be priced around $249 to $299.
1586473	1593256	They're also saying that the system will be out October or November, and they're analyzing there are 3 million.
1593276	1596818	This is coming from Goldman Sachs Investment Firm.
1597178	1598959	I have a big problem with this system.
1599139	1599499	Why is that?
1600246	1605550	They're rumored talking about a portable hard drive for it to kind of be like sort of an MP3 player type thing.
1606150	1607291	I don't like that one bit.
1607511	1610813	I mean, I buy an Xbox system for gaming.
1611214	1612855	I don't buy it for a media player.
1612895	1614576	I don't buy it for, you know, all this crap.
1615397	1618138	There's going to be a lot of gimmicky things with this kind of stuff.
1618178	1621381	It's like, really, how many media players... I don't know.
1621401	1624643	I sort of see the Xbox as more of a hardcore console system and where...
1625023	1632347	People that would have an Xbox would have these like an iPod or a media type thing.
1632467	1637550	I don't really see – it's going to be very gimmicky, and I think they've made a lot of bad decisions with this.
1637950	1638551	But we'll see.
1638791	1639291	We'll see.
1639371	1640052	We don't know yet.
1640132	1641613	We only have rumors to go off of right now.
1642533	1642773	All right.
1643153	1649277	If you have any opinions or thoughts, feedback, send us an email to go at orangeloungeradio.com.
1649317	1651058	Have you been checking that email over there?
1651542	1652263	I have.
1652303	1653784	I've been chatting with a couple people.
1653865	1655066	Heard from anybody interesting?
1655987	1658249	There's one of our UK listeners.
1658810	1660211	His name is Matthew.
1660792	1662974	Right on.
1663074	1671103	He actually was interested in our PSP commentary, although the PSP isn't really out there yet.
1671773	1672153	Oh, okay.
1672413	1673073	So that's cool.
1673093	1676754	We'll try to keep making mentions on progress in the UK.
1676974	1683816	Well, you know, one of my full side projects I'm still working on is some sort of PSP integration for our website eventually.
1684436	1685756	I'm working on it.
1685956	1688877	I have to get my internet up and stuff.
1689037	1689357	Sounds good.
1689397	1695198	By the way, speaking of Orange Launch Radio and our website, we did mention on the show tonight we've had this theme going on of...
1695620	1696660	We are starting over.
1696780	1699422	May 1st is going to bring a lot of changes to OrangeLawsRadio.com.
1699702	1709545	This podcast really isn't going to be changing so much, but our 24-hour, 7-day-a-week live streaming station we have on Live 365 is going to be changing a little bit for the better, we think.
1709766	1711346	It's going to be more of a broad gaming.
1711406	1714227	So those of you guys that listen to this podcast have something to look forward to.
1715788	1718529	Anyway, one more story here tonight.
1720086	1721127	This is interesting here.
1721307	1724751	Games could possibly soon be losing their voice.
1725312	1736303	Online trade magazines are stating that the negotiations between the Screen Actors Guild and game publishers to renew voice acting contracts are kind of on the bubble right now.
1736864	1739407	So this could possibly lead to...
1740327	1741168	A future strike?
1741448	1741848	Who knows?
1742969	1743989	How could this affect things?
1744089	1744910	Well, let's look at this.
1745230	1749393	Charlize Theron is lending her voice to Majesco's Aeon Flux.
1749793	1752835	David Duchovny, Marilyn Manson are doing voices in Midway's Area 51.
1753996	1758258	Sean Connery is doing some voice acting from Russia With Love from EA.
1758659	1759899	Very cool.
1759980	1765423	Marlon Brando did some voice acting, as you may remember, for the Godfather game before it came out.
1766213	1766973	Very interesting.
1767033	1769154	Variety.com making this report.
1770494	1772215	So, who knows?
1772275	1775876	Would you be all torn up if actors, famous actors, had to leave video games?
1776376	1780697	To me, the type of games I play, it doesn't really matter to me.
1781217	1782717	Sometimes, though, they make the game.
1783557	1784038	Sometimes.
1784178	1785478	You know, like, the Buffy game?
1785698	1787138	You know how crazy I was over that?
1787678	1793040	They had everybody except Sir Michelle Gellar, and that just sort of axed it for me.
1793580	1793660	Aww.
1794954	1807261	I know, but look at a game like Final Fantasy X. I mean, some pretty decent voice acting in that game from basically folks who maybe they're big on the anime dubbing, but no screen actors really in that group and they're all pretty good.
1807887	1811708	But the thing is, is that for The Godfather, you expect Marlon Brando.
1811728	1812168	That is true.
1812208	1813009	Okay, that is true.
1813029	1816750	For Bond, you expect Sean Connery, especially since he's playing Bond in the new movie.
1816770	1817650	Why?
1817670	1818871	Because it's supposed to be an older Bond.
1819611	1820211	Interesting.
1820291	1821411	I haven't heard that one.
1821471	1822012	Yeah.
1822032	1822972	That's a stretch.
1823072	1823672	I don't think so.
1823732	1824292	I don't know about that.
1824312	1825313	I don't know where you heard that one.
1825533	1826313	Premier Magazine.
1826653	1828794	The Avengers had Eddie Izzard in it.
1829094	1830094	League of Extraordinary Gentlemen?
1856857	1857197	No, thank you.
1857217	1858098	I needed to see that.
1858938	1863621	How about they just have the wonderful movie Sean Connery Kicks Ass, and that's what it is.
1863701	1867883	It's just him punching one person after another, you know, the end.
1868063	1872886	All right, before we turn into movie chat, I think it's time to end Orange Lounge Radio for this week.
1873206	1874507	We'll be back next week, though.
1874607	1875467	Final thoughts, Loki?
1877088	1879270	I hate moving.
1881091	1881731	Dark Sakura?
1882591	1883532	Reject false icons.
1884437	1886798	My final thought, I've got so much laundry to do.
1888178	1889199	Thanks for listening, everybody.
1889219	1891219	We'll see you next time on the Orange Lounge Radio To-Go Edition.
1893140	1896701	That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To-Go Edition.
1897001	1902563	This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com.
