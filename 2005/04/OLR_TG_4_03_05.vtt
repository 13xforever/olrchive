Summers also known as Dark Sakura I am such a celebrity and our other third

00:43.400 --> 00:49.480
wheel say hello to Loki hello all right so we're going to talk about some gaming

00:49.480 --> 00:54.360
news going on in the world and of course tons of PSP stuff because you know this

00:54.360 --> 00:58.880
PSP has been this gigantic, like, Katamari Damacy ball just rolling down a hill.

00:58.880 --> 01:03.120
It's what's popular this week. It's the big thing, so we'll talk about some PSP

01:03.120 --> 01:07.520
news, but first, what's going on in your gaming world? Dark Sakura. I've been

01:07.520 --> 01:13.320
playing a lot of the games on the Gorillaz.com site, like Widescreen Pong

01:13.320 --> 01:20.720
and HeliDrop. It's been pretty fun. So no, like, consoles or anything? I looked at

01:20.720 --> 01:28.200
Final Fantasy 11 I didn't actually play it though. You looked at it, you just checked it out. I moved my play online icon. I've been too

01:28.200 --> 01:31.680
busy I've been doing other stuff and of course being a famous internet

01:31.680 --> 01:36.400
celebrity. Did you move it to the recycle bin or where did you move the icon?

01:36.400 --> 01:42.400
Elsewhere. Oh okay so that's it not a lot of gaming? I can't be bothered with that kind of

01:42.400 --> 01:47.480
thing anymore I'm a famous internet celebrity. I forgot I'm so sorry and

01:47.480 --> 01:51.080
that's it so this is just the I'm busy being famous all right all right

01:51.080 --> 01:58.800
Loki I bought a PSP sucker no that's cool sucker I if I could afford it I'd

01:58.800 --> 02:03.560
buy one too I'm with the trends no no I got a PSP and I got two games I got the

02:03.560 --> 02:09.840
wipeout pure just because I like the hack yes you bought wipeout pure it has

02:09.840 --> 02:13.640
nothing to do with the fact that you like wipeout because I think I think I

02:13.640 --> 02:16.600
distinctly remember you saying you were disappointed with the wipeout series I

02:16.600 --> 02:18.400
I hated Wipeout, actually.

02:18.400 --> 02:23.100
But you just wanted to buy it because you know it's the game that allows people to hack their PSPs, so...

02:23.100 --> 02:23.600
Yup.

02:23.600 --> 02:24.500
Yeah, that's what I thought.

02:24.500 --> 02:28.100
But I like Wipeout now, because I've been playing it. It's actually pretty fun.

02:28.100 --> 02:33.900
I don't know. I tried Wipeout 3 a while back, and I tried Wipeout XL. I just didn't get into it.

02:33.900 --> 02:34.400
Um...

02:34.400 --> 02:39.000
Nah, you know what? I need to bring over my pair of Negcons.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.200
I need to play Wipeout with a Negcon.

02:41.200 --> 02:43.300
Uh... what is that?

02:43.300 --> 02:44.800
It's a Namco controller.

02:44.800 --> 02:45.600
Oh...

02:45.600 --> 02:46.400
The twisty one.

02:46.400 --> 02:52.900
Okay, okay. And then the one with the little dial is the Jog Con. I've seen those. I have a Jog Con that's completely useless. I have like three Jog Cons.

02:52.900 --> 03:05.400
Um, anyway. Anyways. So yeah, I got Wipeout Pure and I got Twisted Metal Face On, or Head On, I think. And I like, I love Twisted Metal. I mean, Twisted Metal Head On, though, is exactly like Twisted Metal 2, that's all it is.

03:05.400 --> 03:11.400
But, hey, if you're gonna make a remake of one of the original games, Twisted Metal 2 would be the one to do it, because that was, like, one of the best.

03:11.400 --> 03:16.240
Why didn't you get luminous because they weren't selling luminous and I can only afford two games

03:16.240 --> 03:22.340
So, you know those were the two it was either that or you know, I get like some stupid NFL game or something

03:22.760 --> 03:28.080
It's like no. Thank you. I will take twisted metal black or not black head-on and

03:29.840 --> 03:31.840
The white belt pier

03:32.440 --> 03:35.680
but um, so I've been playing those they're fun and I

03:37.200 --> 03:39.200
Do not like

03:39.200 --> 03:42.920
the analog controller on the PSP

03:42.920 --> 03:47.640
it's just not working for me. I think it's cute. I think it could differ, I love it. I think it's cute. It's actually pretty easy.

03:47.640 --> 03:51.800
I don't know it's just it I guess I gotta get used to it but I've been using the

03:51.800 --> 03:52.960
digital stuff for now

03:52.960 --> 03:56.680
and it works just fine for me. Whatever I mean.

03:56.680 --> 04:00.680
I'll need to bring over Darkstalkers.

04:00.680 --> 04:04.240
I'm not a huge fan of Darkstalkers. But it's really neat on the PSP.

04:04.240 --> 04:07.440
I'll take your word for it. I don't know I'm

04:07.440 --> 04:12.020
I'm just like... The other reason I got one though, work related, because my boss just

04:12.020 --> 04:17.700
got one and I figured it'd be kinda cool to just play against him during a break or something

04:17.700 --> 04:21.420
or just to be able to actually play some of the games. Also, I want to drag it with me

04:21.420 --> 04:24.900
to E3 because you know they're going to have WiFi hotspots there and you know there's going

04:24.900 --> 04:29.300
to be PSP crap there. So, might as well drag my portable systems with me.

04:29.300 --> 04:32.100
Brown nosing with a PSP. Very nice.

04:32.100 --> 04:32.700
Exactly.

04:32.700 --> 04:38.080
Alright, great. As far as what's going on in my gaming world, I was, you know, obviously,

04:38.080 --> 04:41.000
since Loki's my roommate, I was checking out his PSP a little bit, so I played a little

04:41.000 --> 04:46.520
bit of Wipeout as well. I suck at Wipeout, though, so forget it. But I kinda want a PSP,

04:46.520 --> 04:49.580
but I'm gonna wait for some later games. I really, really want Luminous, but it's not

04:49.580 --> 04:54.000
enough for me to justify spending so much money on a system at this point. Maybe later.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.640
The one I want is actually, they have that cool one with the, where you disable bombs.

04:58.640 --> 04:59.800
That looked kinda neat.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.340
I don't remember the name of that one offhand, but, hmm.

05:03.080 --> 05:03.580
Oh well.

05:03.580 --> 05:07.080
Anyway, so I'll get a PSP eventually, but it's very pretty, I was watching Spider-Man,

05:07.080 --> 05:11.080
like, even though I've already seen Spider-Man 2, like, twice, and didn't really want to watch it again,

05:11.080 --> 05:13.840
I just wanted to see what video looked like on there, I was quite impressed.

05:14.120 --> 05:15.680
I have to admit, it's pretty nice looking.

05:15.680 --> 05:19.080
You can also, though, download video from your computer.

05:19.620 --> 05:20.120
And actually-

05:20.120 --> 05:22.320
I was telling Loki he needs to put some pornography on there, but-

05:22.320 --> 05:25.960
GameStop's gonna be carrying the 1GB cards coming up soon.

05:25.960 --> 05:30.960
Now, in order to download that stuff, I gotta buy an additional piece of crap that's gotta go with it.

05:30.960 --> 05:31.460
Alright.

05:31.460 --> 05:31.960
Buy the cable.

05:31.960 --> 05:33.960
Then I can just bring our cable over and you can borrow it.

05:33.960 --> 05:37.460
I need to get me, um, a 1 gig stick.

05:37.460 --> 05:38.460
Actually, I'm not even gonna...

05:38.460 --> 05:41.960
Cuz I don't know how much those 1 gig sticks are, what, they're like 200 some dollars or something?

05:41.960 --> 05:42.460
Yikes!

05:42.460 --> 05:46.960
Not necessarily. I think Best Buy was having them for about 130 something.

05:46.960 --> 05:47.960
That's still scary!

05:47.960 --> 05:54.920
Fuck that, cause you know what, you can actually go out there and buy, there's a USB to Mini-B,

05:54.920 --> 06:00.440
which is the like USB thing that's on top of the PSP adapter for $13, and then hook

06:00.440 --> 06:04.120
up your wonderful flash drives, guess what, my flash drive is like, you know, 128 megs

06:04.120 --> 06:06.820
right there, and what, I bought that for 20 bucks?

06:06.820 --> 06:10.400
Fuck that, why the hell would I go spend, you know, tons of money to buy this, you know,

06:10.400 --> 06:11.400
proprietary crap?

06:11.400 --> 06:13.880
It's a good idea in theory, I just hope it works.

06:13.880 --> 06:14.880
I hope it works.

06:14.880 --> 06:17.460
But, you know, I'm just interested.

06:17.460 --> 06:23.720
I've been like jumping on the Wi-Fi spots, you know people that are neighbors and stuff that have internet

06:23.720 --> 06:28.700
And then they put wireless routers without passwords on them. Hey, this is my gaming week. Sorry. That's right

06:29.740 --> 06:32.900
So I instead I picked up a new DS game

06:32.900 --> 06:35.660
I was like, you know, I didn't want to spend $300 on a PSP

06:35.660 --> 06:37.140
But I had to spend money like you know

06:37.140 --> 06:40.940
That money was burning a hole in my pocket because I just did my taxes and I'm getting money back and all that

06:40.980 --> 06:44.580
So I instead decided to go out and buy a new game for the DS

06:44.580 --> 06:48.740
The unfortunate thing is that the DS really doesn't have a whole lot of games on it, and

06:48.740 --> 06:53.580
so, you know, I already have Mario 64 and I already have WarioWare Touch, so what does

06:53.580 --> 06:54.580
that leave?

06:54.580 --> 06:55.580
Not a whole lot.

06:55.580 --> 06:59.700
I already have Feel the Magic, so it was pretty much, it came down between Sprung and this

06:59.700 --> 07:04.540
other title, Yoshi Touch and Go, so I picked up Yoshi Touch and Go.

07:04.540 --> 07:06.100
Not impressed.

07:06.100 --> 07:07.100
Not impressed.

07:07.100 --> 07:11.720
It's just very repetitive to me, and it's very frustrating.

07:11.720 --> 07:16.240
The difficulty bar is set very high, it's something that in some reviews out there on

07:16.240 --> 07:18.760
the internet they were calling this a kids game.

07:18.760 --> 07:22.960
Oh my gosh, I guess kids are smarter than I am because I'm getting so frustrated with

07:22.960 --> 07:27.800
this game trying to beat some of the records you have to beat to unlock new stages.

07:27.800 --> 07:29.220
So I'm pretty much getting sick of this.

07:29.220 --> 07:32.640
So as soon as something better catches my eye, this thing's going, getting sold back

07:32.640 --> 07:33.640
or something.

07:33.640 --> 07:35.160
I just was not impressed with Yoshi Touch and Go.

07:35.160 --> 07:39.280
So Touch and Buy as far as I'm concerned.

07:39.280 --> 07:40.760
Let's get into some gaming news.

07:40.760 --> 07:44.600
found some fun little customizable things ones for the Xbox and ones for

07:44.600 --> 07:48.640
the PSP what'd you find Loki for the Xbox well if you happen to love Hello

07:48.640 --> 07:54.840
Kitty like we all do okay no we all don't but you know what a way to ruin a

07:54.840 --> 07:59.960
perfectly good crystal you know Xbox case by shoving some stupid Hello Kitty

07:59.960 --> 08:05.440
crap on it for Hello Kitty mission rescue the special edition crystal

08:05.440 --> 08:09.760
console that you can get it's basically wait wait I just want clever this isn't

08:09.760 --> 08:13.280
like a giant sticker you put on your existing crystal console, which you can't even get

08:13.280 --> 08:18.800
in this country anyway. But it's a brand new Xbox that they're selling that is specifically

08:18.800 --> 08:20.160
Hello Kitty Mission Rescue.

08:20.160 --> 08:25.080
Yup, with this crappy crystal console. It's a crystal console, which is like really awesome,

08:25.080 --> 08:32.080
but... I don't know. Anyways, so, before they had a pink Xbox, why would you buy an Xbox?

08:33.400 --> 08:37.360
Yeah, because you know, I've been really waiting for the Hello Kitty game to come out for me

08:37.360 --> 08:42.960
to buy an Xbox. That's been the game that will do it for me. But anyways, so they have

08:42.960 --> 08:49.240
this Hello Kitty Crystal Xbox console that you can get. It comes with a crystal controller,

08:49.240 --> 08:56.120
which hopefully doesn't have this pink crap on it, and the Mission Rescue game for $99

08:56.120 --> 09:02.160
with the purchase of a selected Samsung LCD TV, and you can only get it in Singapore on

09:02.160 --> 09:08.760
eBay where people would be selling it from Singapore so there's that then if

09:08.760 --> 09:14.800
you are the wonderful celebrity they've been doing Simmons jeweler company made

09:14.800 --> 09:20.720
some accessories for the Sony PSP they debuted this at the March 14th or at

09:20.720 --> 09:26.560
March 14th at the Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood dubbed the print that

09:26.560 --> 09:31.480
print a PSP whatever that's supposed to mean and it says that brought together

09:31.480 --> 09:38.200
There's some of the hottest names in fashion other well-known designers including Marc Jacobs and will it wait wait

09:38.400 --> 09:43.800
This was a fashion show for PSP's and I correct here. Ah, yes, I believe you're correct

09:44.400 --> 09:46.400
It's now this isn't

09:47.800 --> 09:50.340
It's the top models including Maggie Riser

09:51.400 --> 09:54.200
Kirstie Hume and people we don't care about come on

09:54.200 --> 09:55.880
No gamer cares about the people.

09:55.880 --> 10:00.400
Anyways, so showed off the newest trend in fashion by wearing the sexy, sleek PSP accessories

10:00.400 --> 10:01.720
with the latest looks and fall.

10:01.720 --> 10:05.640
What I love about this is that it's bling for your PSP is really what it is.

10:05.640 --> 10:06.640
It's bling bling.

10:06.640 --> 10:07.640
Like, look at this.

10:07.640 --> 10:11.180
You've got this gold PSP and there's a whole nother joke that can be made there about the

10:11.180 --> 10:13.600
golden PSP if anybody watches South Park.

10:13.600 --> 10:20.020
But you can get the gold PSP and you get these bling, bling chains that hang from it.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.020
It's tacky.

10:21.020 --> 10:25.820
And you want to know what the gemstones on their cell phones and shit.

10:25.820 --> 10:27.980
And you want to know how much this costs, folks?

10:27.980 --> 10:29.020
Oh god.

10:29.020 --> 10:32.740
Because this isn't going to be for the average user, I don't know why you'd want to buy one

10:32.740 --> 10:37.180
in the first place unless you're like some overpaid rapper with no taste.

10:37.180 --> 10:38.820
It would be $35,000.

10:38.820 --> 10:39.820
Whoo!

10:39.820 --> 10:45.660
$35,000 to make your PSP look like crap?

10:45.660 --> 10:50.060
okay if I wanted to make the PSP look like crap I could go to like the craft

10:50.060 --> 10:57.660
store and buy you know sculpty plastic and says it says a list celebrities and

10:57.660 --> 11:04.020
showed up to this and this is a list yeah very moderately a list celebrities

11:04.020 --> 11:09.380
Hillary Duff Haley Duff is Haley Duff even popular Haley who is Haley Duff I

11:09.380 --> 11:12.380
I imagine Hilary Dove's sister maybe?

11:12.380 --> 11:13.380
Or lover or something.

11:13.380 --> 11:16.380
Nicole Ritchie and fiancé DJ AM and...

11:16.380 --> 11:19.280
Nicole Ritchie, who you book when he can't get Paris Hilton.

11:19.280 --> 11:21.500
And Michael Vartan, whoever he is.

11:21.500 --> 11:22.500
And apparently I guess...

11:22.500 --> 11:23.500
He's on Alias.

11:23.500 --> 11:24.500
Oh.

11:24.500 --> 11:25.500
I don't know how I know that, I just do.

11:25.500 --> 11:26.500
Sorry guys.

11:26.500 --> 11:27.500
Okay.

11:27.500 --> 11:29.380
And I don't know who bought this, but I know that David Arquette was there and I know he's

11:29.380 --> 11:31.340
a big gamer, so he might have bought this.

11:31.340 --> 11:32.340
I don't know.

11:32.340 --> 11:33.340
You know what though?

11:33.340 --> 11:38.580
He was one that bought one of those pimped out DS's, I remember that, so...

11:38.580 --> 11:39.580
Who knows?

11:39.580 --> 11:40.580
More power to them.

11:40.580 --> 11:42.700
Pimp my game system.

11:42.700 --> 11:43.700
In other news...

11:43.700 --> 11:45.400
Yeah, let's hear some DS news.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.860
Another news in the DS, the other portable game world events, saying this is going to

11:48.860 --> 11:49.860
happen.

11:49.860 --> 11:54.300
It says Pass Me, which for those who don't know, it's this device that's actually made

11:54.300 --> 12:00.020
to be able to port your own code using the Game Boy code thingy.

12:00.020 --> 12:03.620
And what websites is this all being documented on?

12:03.620 --> 12:05.140
On dslinux.org.

12:05.140 --> 12:08.740
That's right, they ported Linux to the DS.

12:08.740 --> 12:11.900
The first alpha for it should be coming out in about a month, they say.

12:11.900 --> 12:12.900
It's only a matter of time.

12:12.900 --> 12:13.900
Oh, why, why, why?

12:13.900 --> 12:14.900
And of course...

12:14.900 --> 12:18.220
If it's got a computer chip in it, Linux can be installed on it.

12:18.220 --> 12:21.460
As you could probably guess, Linux is already being...

12:21.460 --> 12:25.300
They're already attempting to port Linux to the PSP, so...

12:25.300 --> 12:26.300
Of course.

12:26.300 --> 12:27.300
Yay.

12:27.300 --> 12:29.620
I'm personally porting Linux to my toaster oven.

12:29.620 --> 12:34.980
Honestly, if Linux is so popular, why is it not outselling Windows?

12:34.980 --> 12:42.980
In other DS news, you know they did the new color DS's in Japan, they have graphite black

12:42.980 --> 12:47.540
and pure white, and I know we sit here and sometimes joke like, haha Nintendo, you know

12:47.540 --> 12:51.560
they just re-release the system in new colors to try and drive up sales, but what kind of

12:51.560 --> 12:54.780
idiots actually buy the system all over again just for a new color?

12:54.780 --> 12:58.740
Well let me put this in a little bit of perspective for you guys.

12:58.740 --> 13:04.740
Sales for the week of March 21st to the March 27th when these new colors debuted, 54,000

13:04.740 --> 13:09.900
in Japan the previous week was only 21,000 more than double the sales just

13:09.900 --> 13:14.900
by rolling out two new colors hmm you know and this kind of matches with that

13:14.900 --> 13:19.020
bling PSP story that there are people out there that will buy the gaming

13:19.020 --> 13:22.700
system to match their purse you know what's sad is people don't realize that

13:22.700 --> 13:27.240
you can actually go and find the mods yourself and do this for like a lot

13:27.240 --> 13:32.220
cheaper than buying a brand new system or paying $35,000 we'll see what happens

13:32.220 --> 13:38.300
Yeah, for $35,000, I can make an all-in-one gaming unit with its own built-in, like, keg

13:38.300 --> 13:40.060
or something, you know?

13:40.060 --> 13:41.360
Why pay $35?

13:41.360 --> 13:42.660
I would pay for that.

13:42.660 --> 13:46.860
I mean, why pay $35,000 for, like, a golden PSP?

13:46.860 --> 13:49.220
A gaming system with a keg.

13:49.220 --> 13:54.560
Which as soon as you drop it, will be $35,000 wasted.

13:54.560 --> 13:56.740
A gaming system with a keg?

13:56.740 --> 13:59.220
One day we'll be famous and spending that kind of money on games.

13:59.220 --> 14:00.220
I'm already famous.

14:00.220 --> 14:04.820
I oh I forgot sorry we will see what happens to the sales

14:04.820 --> 14:09.940
of Japan's DS units on April 21st when turquoise blue and candy pink

14:09.940 --> 14:13.100
roll out. And then barf green

14:13.100 --> 14:16.420
you know there's people out there the one at candy pink DS

14:16.420 --> 14:19.620
just you wait for the transparent

14:19.620 --> 14:24.500
crystal DS to be coming out and then they'll have crystal pink and crystal blue

14:24.500 --> 14:29.300
exactly alright alright anyway. And then there's baby shit yellow green

14:29.300 --> 14:31.300
Look moving on

14:33.620 --> 14:37.140
Here's some interesting news, you know the four swords that was out on GameCube

14:38.560 --> 14:42.780
Zelda four swords certainly for to this. Come on. Give me a break. Well, not a lot of people

14:43.860 --> 14:47.220
Not a lot of people really played this game because you in order to do it

14:47.220 --> 14:51.300
You had to have the link cables if you really wanted to get four people in on the fun

14:51.300 --> 14:53.780
You had to have the link cable. So everybody could be their own link

14:53.780 --> 14:59.700
yeah okay but only the hardcore gaming nerds like yourself could really

14:59.700 --> 15:04.740
participate in this okay so what now they're gonna make this game a little

15:04.740 --> 15:10.380
more accessible by rolling it out on the DS so because the DS is wireless they're

15:10.380 --> 15:16.180
gonna be doing this so according this is according to retail sources now Nintendo

15:16.180 --> 15:21.640
has announced this in Japan no release dates nothing yet but I logically I

15:21.640 --> 15:24.600
I would say if this game comes out in Japan, it's only a matter of time before it's out

15:24.600 --> 15:28.360
in the U.S. Probably something we'll see by year's end. Who knows?

15:28.360 --> 15:32.360
Something we'll see in 83, probably. Who knows?

15:32.360 --> 15:37.560
April Fools was this past week, and of course a lot of websites rolled out their own haha

15:37.560 --> 15:40.920
funny stuff. Not that we would ever do this. We didn't participate at all.

15:40.920 --> 15:44.140
No, we don't believe in April Fools Day. We didn't do anything on the site, nothing

15:44.140 --> 15:47.760
in LiveJournal. Absolutely nothing. We would never, you know,

15:47.760 --> 15:50.880
make up stories about being bought or anything like that. We'd never do that. We're bigger

15:50.880 --> 15:57.480
we ever sell out yeah exactly we would never sell out here's some popular April

15:57.480 --> 16:00.920
Fool's jokes you might have seen these are all jokes by the way epic games

16:00.920 --> 16:07.320
announcing unreal 3 sorry this was funny a slash dot said that online support for

16:07.320 --> 16:11.720
the PlayStation 2 version of Final Fantasy 11 is gonna be discontinued just

16:11.720 --> 16:16.080
to piss off the people who spent $99 that's beautiful and actually that

16:16.080 --> 16:20.000
would be a dream come true world of Warcraft is going to incorporate and

16:20.000 --> 16:25.780
And this was announced on World of Warcraft site, they are incorporating slash panda,

16:25.780 --> 16:31.600
so you can get deliveries from Pandaren Express, and it comes delivered to you with a guy dressed

16:31.600 --> 16:33.960
in costume.

16:33.960 --> 16:37.440
This is an April Fools joke mind you, not a reality, but the pictures were so cute because

16:37.440 --> 16:42.820
it actually had a little panda in the game, so cute.

16:42.820 --> 16:48.980
Let's see, also other stories that were going on, we had OC Remix announcing a partnership

16:48.980 --> 16:54.940
with EA, and uh, let's see, Computer and Video Games announcing that Shrek 2 characters will

16:54.940 --> 16:57.180
be in the GameCube release of Soulcalibur 3.

16:57.180 --> 16:58.180
Hahahaha.

16:58.180 --> 16:59.180
Barf.

16:59.180 --> 17:01.780
That would be hilarious.

17:01.780 --> 17:02.780
But this was a really...

17:02.780 --> 17:03.780
I play this the dragon.

17:03.780 --> 17:07.240
What I thought was really funny is something that GameSpot did, they actually ran an article

17:07.240 --> 17:12.740
saying that John Woo had actually bought the rights to the Katamari Damacy movie, and it

17:12.740 --> 17:16.980
was gonna star The Rock as the prince of all cosmos.

17:16.980 --> 17:18.820
That's great.

17:18.820 --> 17:20.340
I would actually pay to see that.

17:20.340 --> 17:25.280
So I'm going to bestow the winner to the best April Fools prank on GameSpot for the Katamari

17:25.280 --> 17:27.300
Damacy starring The Rock.

17:27.300 --> 17:35.500
Other really crappy nominations would go to Alakazam for saying that Final Fantasy XI

17:35.500 --> 17:39.900
and World of Warcraft merged, which fooled no one.

17:39.900 --> 17:42.940
And um, yeah.

17:42.940 --> 17:46.740
Slashdot really sucked because they had a ton of, all the articles on April 1st were

17:46.740 --> 17:47.740
all fake, so.

17:47.740 --> 17:48.740
That's too bad.

17:48.740 --> 17:52.820
checked game facts.com because they do something every year like one year they

17:52.820 --> 17:58.000
did this is a few years ago they did Xbox that's the one I remember that they

17:58.000 --> 18:01.340
got bought by Microsoft or something I don't I think somebody was telling me

18:01.340 --> 18:05.400
all the mods got but all the mods banned themselves or something but if you're

18:05.400 --> 18:07.960
not a member of the community you may not have seen it I don't know so we'll

18:07.960 --> 18:13.240
see anyway um orange launch radio we're not just here to talk about video games

18:13.240 --> 18:18.360
all the time because if you live eat breathe sleep video games you're never

18:18.360 --> 18:21.960
to get out of the damn house. You're never going to get laid. No. So we're here also

18:21.960 --> 18:27.560
to give you advice on how to better your life. And who better than I believe you could be

18:27.560 --> 18:33.980
Daruk Sakura, the only podcast video game female. I could be wrong, but you may be.

18:33.980 --> 18:38.660
So she's here to give you her little bit of advice. So what is the advice you're going

18:38.660 --> 18:47.360
to give tonight? Today's bit of advice is how to survive a nuclear explosion. In the

18:47.360 --> 18:55.360
In the event of a nuclear war or explosion, get to a safe shelter as quickly as possible and remain inside for four to six days after the last explosion.

18:55.360 --> 19:04.360
An underground shelter covered by one meter or more of earth will provide the best protection against nuclear explosion and fallout radiation.

19:04.360 --> 19:10.360
If you must submerge, limit your surface exposure to no more than 30 minutes a day for 13 days following the explosion.

19:10.360 --> 19:14.360
If you have been exposed to radiation immediately, wash your body thoroughly with soap and water.

19:14.360 --> 19:17.360
This will remove most of the radiation particles, but not all.

19:17.360 --> 19:22.360
Water can be safely obtained from underground sources, springs and wells for example,

19:22.360 --> 19:27.360
that undergo natural filtration, or from pipes in houses or stores.

19:27.360 --> 19:32.360
Healthy looking wild animals are a safe food source if other food sources are not available.

19:32.360 --> 19:35.360
Avoid any meat close to the bones and joints.

19:35.360 --> 19:39.360
An animal skeleton holds more than 90% of the radioactivity.

19:39.360 --> 19:41.360
Any last pieces of advice?

19:41.360 --> 19:43.360
Yeah, don't live in Iraq!

19:46.360 --> 19:48.360
Alright, moving on.

19:48.360 --> 19:52.360
We talked briefly about an April Fool's joke that involves Soul Calibur 3.

19:52.360 --> 19:57.360
Well, here's something that's not a joke. Some recent details being announced on Soul Calibur 3.

19:57.360 --> 20:05.360
Interview with the game's producer revealed on the official Japanese Soul Calibur 3 site, some official things revealed.

20:05.360 --> 20:10.660
They will not be doing guest characters on PlayStation 2, although they have received offers.

20:10.660 --> 20:16.160
As soon as they've received offers, but the policy is, we don't do the same thing twice.

20:16.160 --> 20:17.960
Crash Bandicoot?

20:17.960 --> 20:19.560
Please no, please no.

20:19.560 --> 20:22.060
God no.

20:22.060 --> 20:25.460
I like the idea of having the prince of all cosmos, you know, just roll people over.

20:25.460 --> 20:27.660
What about Sonic?

20:27.660 --> 20:29.060
Nope, not gonna happen, sorry.

20:29.060 --> 20:30.560
There's already Sonic fighters.

20:30.560 --> 20:34.480
Here's the other bummer, a lot of people had their hopes up about this but it was

20:34.480 --> 20:37.080
confirmed by the games producer

20:37.080 --> 20:40.560
no online play. You can go online, the PS2?

20:40.560 --> 20:44.640
Who'd have thunk it? The official reason here, at the current time the online

20:44.640 --> 20:47.840
infrastructure is extremely different between countries

20:47.840 --> 20:52.000
and there's people that can't enjoy network gaming. We've decided to

20:52.000 --> 20:55.960
concentrate on improving the game's offline content and its characters

20:55.960 --> 20:59.440
so that people all over the world will be able to have fun.

20:59.440 --> 21:03.040
that was nice of them that well that seems like just kind of a to me it's

21:03.040 --> 21:04.540
more of like a you know

21:04.540 --> 21:05.640
cheap well

21:05.640 --> 21:10.320
we didn't want to do the online thing cuz we want to make offline better one

21:10.320 --> 21:14.060
course well i want to make offline better we've been idea is to do both

21:14.060 --> 21:15.760
really well but whatever

21:15.760 --> 21:19.940
we've been holding off on doing online because we're worried about how tech in

21:19.940 --> 21:23.020
five is going to beat our ass senseless i

21:23.020 --> 21:24.640
i don't know it's all namco

21:24.640 --> 21:26.920
it's all namco either way

21:26.920 --> 21:27.920
They're getting the money.

21:27.920 --> 21:28.920
Who burned?

21:28.920 --> 21:29.920
Got you.

21:29.920 --> 21:30.920
Oh no.

21:30.920 --> 21:35.320
You just got game served.

21:35.320 --> 21:36.320
Let's see.

21:36.320 --> 21:37.320
Moving on.

21:37.320 --> 21:40.240
Capcom, doing a little bit of ego inflation this week with a press release, talking about

21:40.240 --> 21:46.740
their game sales, talking about their series, how successful their game series are.

21:46.740 --> 21:47.920
What would you think?

21:47.920 --> 21:48.920
Just asking.

21:48.920 --> 21:52.720
Now, you're reading, Loki, so you can't guess, but if you had to guess, what is Capcom's

21:52.720 --> 21:54.400
number one series of all time?

21:54.400 --> 21:55.400
What would you guess?

21:55.400 --> 21:56.400
Dark Sakura.

21:56.400 --> 22:03.240
Street Fighter, Street Fighter is number two with, they're on the sales chart, 24 million

22:03.240 --> 22:07.720
cumulative units over 53 different titles.

22:07.720 --> 22:08.960
Breath of Fire?

22:08.960 --> 22:16.840
Breath of Fire is number, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, number 10 on the list, 13 titles, 3

22:16.840 --> 22:17.840
million units.

22:17.840 --> 22:20.560
Oh, what the fuck else did Capcom do?

22:20.560 --> 22:30.060
Um, Mega Man. Mega Man would be number three on the list. 95 games. Strider! 22.9 million

22:30.060 --> 22:36.040
units. Strider not on the list. Strider is awesome. I'll give you a hint. It was a series

22:36.040 --> 22:41.440
so huge they made movies out of it. Oh, they made Street Fighter movies too, but we don't

22:41.440 --> 22:46.340
deny the existence of that. If you don't get this right, you're going to end up in a Jamie

22:46.340 --> 22:58.520
sandwich resident evil resident evil is the number one okay you know what

22:58.520 --> 23:02.720

23:27.680 --> 23:34.200
CD I have mighty final fight. I have final fight guy. That's it. That's Wow having final fight guy

23:34.200 --> 23:36.300

23:36.880 --> 23:40.280
Anyway, yeah. Okay. Anyway, sorry moving on

23:40.280 --> 23:45.360
Doom 3 is coming out this week. You want to pick it up at midnight? Blockbuster.

23:45.360 --> 23:48.500
They have that gaming division called Game Rush. They're gonna be doing a

23:48.500 --> 23:53.240
midnight sale Monday April 4th so by the time some of you guys hear this you may

23:53.240 --> 23:56.400

24:03.260 --> 24:08.080
Avenue in Dallas there will actually be some folks from ID Software there in

24:08.080 --> 24:11.920

as famous as we are you know internet celebrities you know what I heard what

24:15.520 --> 24:20.320

24:20.320 --> 24:26.320

25:00.600 --> 25:05.760
going to be an action role-playing game set on a futuristic post-apocalyptic

25:05.760 --> 25:10.160
Planet. I love that word. Post-apocalyptic. Aren't they all?

25:10.160 --> 25:14.160
Squeenix doing an RPG? Who would have thought? Seriously.

25:14.160 --> 25:17.720
Game is being produced by Naora Yusuke,

25:17.720 --> 25:21.600
who worked as an artist for many of Squeenix's games, including Final Fantasy X

25:21.600 --> 25:22.840
and Unlimited Saga.

25:22.840 --> 25:26.680
Very, very good Squeenix game and a very, very shitty Squeenix game. I hate the

25:26.680 --> 25:27.560
Saga series.

28:34.620 --> 28:39.140
