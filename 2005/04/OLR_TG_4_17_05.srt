00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:52,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

7
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:53,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

8
00:00:53,711 --> 00:00:55,091
[SPEAKER_02]: You're very tired, aren't you, Loki?

9
00:00:55,191 --> 00:00:56,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Very tired.

10
00:00:56,051 --> 00:00:57,572
[SPEAKER_02]: And why is it that you're pretty tired this week?

11
00:00:57,812 --> 00:00:58,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving.

12
00:00:58,812 --> 00:00:59,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Sucks.

13
00:00:59,653 --> 00:01:05,975
[SPEAKER_02]: For those of you guys who are listening to the Sunday night show, the three-hour program, it was kind of a sappy show this week because... It was full of pants.

14
00:01:06,535 --> 00:01:11,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it was our kind of goodbye to the studio as we evolve.

15
00:01:12,057 --> 00:01:13,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio is kind of evolving.

16
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:15,198
[SPEAKER_02]: This podcast is a big part of that.

17
00:01:15,539 --> 00:01:18,520
[SPEAKER_02]: We're taking Orange Lounge Radio, our internet station we do on Live365...

18
00:01:19,904 --> 00:01:23,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Best of Live 365 Nominated Broadcaster of the Year.

19
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,325
[SPEAKER_02]: We're very excited about that.

20
00:01:24,365 --> 00:01:25,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Those awards happen in a couple weeks.

21
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:26,625
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're excited about that.

22
00:01:27,725 --> 00:01:33,266
[SPEAKER_02]: We're taking our station on Live 365 and kind of revamping it to be a general video gaming station.

23
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:34,867
[SPEAKER_02]: This podcast is a big part of that.

24
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:37,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, DDR fans shouldn't be too upset.

25
00:01:37,387 --> 00:01:40,868
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still going to have Rhythm of Music Games be a big part of that.

26
00:01:41,488 --> 00:01:44,848
[SPEAKER_02]: But I believe, DarkSakura, you said this a couple weeks ago, and I think it describes this whole thing best.

27
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:47,949
[SPEAKER_02]: We are gamer fans first, DDR fans second.

28
00:01:48,772 --> 00:01:49,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

29
00:01:49,935 --> 00:01:54,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Because DDR is a game, so we're gamer fans before anything else.

30
00:01:54,366 --> 00:02:00,610
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR is a subcategory of the gamer thing.

31
00:02:01,051 --> 00:02:06,334
[SPEAKER_02]: So this podcast we do is kind of the kickoff of that, dedicated to other gaming things, and we're all here.

32
00:02:06,615 --> 00:02:09,296
[SPEAKER_02]: All three of us are here live in person in studio.

33
00:02:09,356 --> 00:02:12,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody had asked a question a while back, do you Skype in any of your co-hosts?

34
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:12,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, we don't.

35
00:02:12,859 --> 00:02:15,901
[SPEAKER_02]: We are all here live in the flesh so we can interact with each other.

36
00:02:16,061 --> 00:02:20,124
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually an artificial intelligent program here that just acts like me.

37
00:02:20,944 --> 00:02:22,305
[SPEAKER_03]: We've nicknamed him Simone.

38
00:02:22,746 --> 00:02:23,026
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

39
00:02:23,386 --> 00:02:24,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, let's get to it.

40
00:02:24,347 --> 00:02:26,649
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your game of the week been like, DarkSakura?

41
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:27,569
[SPEAKER_03]: I ain't played shit.

42
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:28,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

43
00:02:29,031 --> 00:02:32,593
[SPEAKER_03]: No, actually, I did play something, now that I think about it.

44
00:02:32,654 --> 00:02:35,216
[SPEAKER_03]: I played the Jeep Simulator on the Gorillaz site.

45
00:02:35,716 --> 00:02:37,097
[SPEAKER_02]: You and your web games.

46
00:02:37,177 --> 00:02:49,367
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun, because if anyone has seen the 19-2000 video, they're on this big stretch of a highway being chased by aliens and salvation and things like that.

47
00:02:50,067 --> 00:02:53,168
[SPEAKER_03]: and you can actually drive the whole freeway that they're on.

48
00:02:53,388 --> 00:02:56,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, promise me this week you'll tarry yourself on the website to play another game.

49
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,090
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a house full of games.

50
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,371
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Legos too.

51
00:03:00,651 --> 00:03:01,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, you played the Lego game.

52
00:03:01,912 --> 00:03:16,678
[SPEAKER_03]: I played the Star Wars Lego game and it was really cool because we got enough money in the game to unlock General Grievous and the next Star Wars movie he's supposed to have killed these four Jedi and uses their lightsabers as his damn weapons and he's got four arms.

53
00:03:16,758 --> 00:03:17,398
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really rad.

54
00:03:17,418 --> 00:03:17,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

55
00:03:18,263 --> 00:03:21,844
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's like kicking ass all the time and I'm over there using like Anakin.

56
00:03:23,045 --> 00:03:23,585
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

57
00:03:23,665 --> 00:03:25,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, I'm evil.

58
00:03:25,465 --> 00:03:26,026
[SPEAKER_03]: No spoilers.

59
00:03:26,466 --> 00:03:27,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, I'm Vader.

60
00:03:28,907 --> 00:03:29,207
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

61
00:03:30,187 --> 00:03:30,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else?

62
00:03:30,707 --> 00:03:31,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the Lego game?

63
00:03:32,108 --> 00:03:33,468
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of it.

64
00:03:33,848 --> 00:03:34,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

65
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:36,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm glad you were able to tear yourself away to at least give that a try.

66
00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:37,029
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious.

67
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:38,230
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been busy with school.

68
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,190
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a lot of crap up.

69
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,411
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not huge on Star Wars.

70
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:45,432
[SPEAKER_02]: I respect the films, but I'm not like, oh my God, I wet my pants, Revenge of the Sith.

71
00:03:46,752 --> 00:03:47,592
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're cool games.

72
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:54,498
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some good games that come out of the series, so I'm curious about this Lego... I think it's kind of hilarious, the whole concept, Lego meets Star Wars.

73
00:03:54,738 --> 00:03:56,840
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's the dumbest thing I've ever seen.

74
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,622
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really stupid-looking, but it was fun.

75
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:02,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Fun is what games are all about, though.

76
00:04:02,424 --> 00:04:02,905
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, good.

77
00:04:02,925 --> 00:04:06,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Make a fun game that could be Star Wars, not featuring Legos.

78
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:12,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Intelligent Cube was a stupid-looking game, because it was like, oh, these falling cubes, but it's one of the most brilliant PlayStation games they ever did.

79
00:04:12,092 --> 00:04:13,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Rogue Squadron was fun.

80
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:15,714
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why you don't see Tickle Me Elmo the game.

81
00:04:15,734 --> 00:04:16,894
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that would be stupid.

82
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:19,655
[SPEAKER_03]: But that still doesn't stop them from putting Mary-Kate and Ashley games out.

83
00:04:19,775 --> 00:04:20,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh-huh.

84
00:04:20,415 --> 00:04:21,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what's your game of the week been like?

85
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:24,976
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Luminous, and I played Ridge Racer for the PSP.

86
00:04:26,617 --> 00:04:29,077
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're fun.

87
00:04:29,738 --> 00:04:30,238
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of fun.

88
00:04:30,298 --> 00:04:38,660
[SPEAKER_01]: Ridge Racer's pretty cool because it's like a throwback to the old R4, which is the best one, I think, that was available for the original PlayStation.

89
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:42,415
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they have R5 tracks in there as well.

90
00:04:42,756 --> 00:04:45,238
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are pretty good.

91
00:04:45,278 --> 00:04:49,442
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess you can unlock the intros for both of those games as well.

92
00:04:50,203 --> 00:04:50,884
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a lot of fun.

93
00:04:51,304 --> 00:04:52,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to play it against my boss.

94
00:04:53,186 --> 00:04:54,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Kicked his ass by 10 seconds.

95
00:04:55,849 --> 00:04:57,791
[SPEAKER_01]: I had never actually played the game when I played him.

96
00:04:59,292 --> 00:05:00,033
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not that much.

97
00:05:00,053 --> 00:05:01,194
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he's a gamer, but

98
00:05:02,174 --> 00:05:04,775
[SPEAKER_01]: He's probably just not as hardcore as I am.

99
00:05:05,615 --> 00:05:05,895
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh well.

100
00:05:06,155 --> 00:05:10,015
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Luminous is interesting.

101
00:05:10,216 --> 00:05:15,396
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so simple, but you can kind of screw yourself up pretty easy on it.

102
00:05:15,977 --> 00:05:17,097
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's interesting.

103
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:18,697
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just something you've got to play, I guess.

104
00:05:19,197 --> 00:05:22,638
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also put Robot Chicken, five episodes of it, on my PSP.

105
00:05:23,178 --> 00:05:24,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing the hacksaw thing?

106
00:05:24,578 --> 00:05:25,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Lead hacksawing?

107
00:05:25,238 --> 00:05:25,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really.

108
00:05:25,898 --> 00:05:28,839
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's a feature of the PSP to put video on it, so that's what I did.

109
00:05:29,744 --> 00:05:31,124
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

110
00:05:31,444 --> 00:05:37,386
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, my gaming week was kind of similar, where I actually played Donkey Konga this week over at my buddy's house.

111
00:05:37,406 --> 00:05:39,887
[SPEAKER_02]: We were playing Donkey Konga, and I haven't played Donkey Konga a whole lot.

112
00:05:39,947 --> 00:05:41,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, maybe this is like my second or third time playing it.

113
00:05:42,007 --> 00:05:43,908
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was playing all the crazy songs.

114
00:05:44,028 --> 00:05:47,269
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like how Loki was kicking ass at Ridge Racer his first time playing it.

115
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:57,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because I've played so many of the rhythm beat games, and since I'd played Taiko no Tatsujin before, which is Taiko Drum Master, which is basically the same thing as Donkey Konga, just in a different setup.

116
00:05:58,112 --> 00:06:01,554
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no problem clearing the difficult songs, so they were going like, how are you doing that?

117
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:02,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Your second time playing?

118
00:06:02,675 --> 00:06:03,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, what's wrong?

119
00:06:05,516 --> 00:06:12,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Also during my gaming week, I also played a little bit of Luminous, which, wow, that game is just, it really is as amazing as everybody says it is.

120
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,941
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so addicting.

121
00:06:14,802 --> 00:06:22,966
[SPEAKER_02]: It's seizure-inducing at times, but once you get the hang of it, there's some very good, I would highly recommend over on GameFacts.com, GameFAQs.com,

122
00:06:24,647 --> 00:06:31,670
[SPEAKER_02]: They have some luminous facts, and you wouldn't think that a puzzle game would need it, but when you read it, it really improved my game.

123
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:38,453
[SPEAKER_02]: I was not able to get past the second skin, but then when I read the FAQs, I was up to, like, skin number 10 on my next game.

124
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:40,554
[SPEAKER_02]: So I highly recommend checking that out.

125
00:06:40,594 --> 00:06:42,975
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have not been able to get the song Shinin' out of my head.

126
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:46,377
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the song that plays in the first stage, the Mato Grosso song.

127
00:06:46,997 --> 00:06:48,458
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be shinin' to do...

128
00:06:49,438 --> 00:06:50,199
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

129
00:07:11,812 --> 00:07:17,097
[SPEAKER_02]: This is posted on PSPHacks.blogspot.com.

130
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,599
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the PSP Home Control version 1.0.

131
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:28,326
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's actually a way that you can control your DVD player, TiVo, and high-definition television all from your PSP.

132
00:07:28,386 --> 00:07:29,467
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what some guy did.

133
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,670
[SPEAKER_02]: He made graphics in Photoshop and everything.

134
00:07:33,311 --> 00:07:33,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Crazy.

135
00:07:34,051 --> 00:07:36,492
[SPEAKER_02]: He's actually controlling devices using his PSP.

136
00:07:37,932 --> 00:07:39,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Not something for everybody.

137
00:07:39,173 --> 00:07:41,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, it's using the wipeout hacks to be able to do this.

138
00:07:41,653 --> 00:07:47,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Not something for everybody, but certainly shows the potential the PSP has as a device.

139
00:07:47,715 --> 00:07:52,656
[SPEAKER_02]: If it can do this with a little bit of tweaking, it's only a matter of time before some of these features come into the mainstream.

140
00:07:52,676 --> 00:07:53,496
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is kind of neat.

141
00:07:54,296 --> 00:07:59,398
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that's actually pretty cool that's coming out later on is a game where you can actually make your own game.

142
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:00,398
[SPEAKER_01]: Sort of the

143
00:08:00,865 --> 00:08:04,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Memory cards and then probably upload it to the internet and all that wonderful fun stuff.

144
00:08:04,027 --> 00:08:07,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's going to unleash a whole other community upon itself.

145
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:07,950
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be interesting.

146
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,992
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the RPG makers or fighter makers.

147
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:12,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Or ZZT if you want to get really old school.

148
00:08:12,094 --> 00:08:13,495
[SPEAKER_02]: But, oh my god.

149
00:08:14,195 --> 00:08:17,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Port that to the... Oh, please somebody.

150
00:08:17,858 --> 00:08:20,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop porting Linux and start porting ZZT.

151
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Why the hell... If you have any idea what I'm talking about, please port ZZT to the PSP.

152
00:08:25,664 --> 00:08:26,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Too many acronyms, I know.

153
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:27,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Eh, put Linux on your toaster.

154
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:37,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, if you want to check that out again, it's psphacks.blogspot.com Moving on, Halo 2 is going to be getting a big update this week.

155
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:41,969
[SPEAKER_02]: This Monday, Bungie is putting out a brand new patch for Halo 2.

156
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:46,911
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be pretty big because they're actually going to alter the way some of the weapons work.

157
00:08:46,931 --> 00:08:49,692
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be doing some changes with the melee damage.

158
00:08:49,892 --> 00:08:52,453
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be changing the way grenades work a little bit.

159
00:08:52,513 --> 00:08:57,695
[SPEAKER_02]: The fuse timer is going to be tightened up a little bit and the damage caused is going to be increased.

160
00:08:58,295 --> 00:09:00,077
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just changing some other things here and there.

161
00:09:20,697 --> 00:09:22,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Too many hacks out there right now.

162
00:09:22,717 --> 00:09:29,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Too many people taking abuse of the glitches that are on there right now that have falsified the leaderboards.

163
00:09:29,358 --> 00:09:30,059
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one aspect.

164
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:31,319
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pretty big answer here.

165
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:34,119
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd urge you guys to check it out if you're a Halo fan over at Bungie.net.

166
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,200
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're basically going to reset to give everyone a fair shot since they are tweaking the rules.

167
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:47,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Although they say to the casual player, which would be me, I think I fall in this category because I suck at Halo, you won't even notice the difference.

168
00:09:47,562 --> 00:09:50,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Something the hardcore players are going to notice the difference in.

169
00:09:51,428 --> 00:09:53,890
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet neither of you care because you don't play Halo at all, do you?

170
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Halo makes me throw up.

171
00:09:55,811 --> 00:09:56,552
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Halo.

172
00:09:56,632 --> 00:09:58,513
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Halo, but it makes me motion sick.

173
00:09:59,154 --> 00:10:01,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, so you don't throw up because you hate the game.

174
00:10:01,315 --> 00:10:09,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I literally get so motion sick that I would like to, you know, remove the contents of my lunch from my stomach and offer it to the porcelain goddess on my knees.

175
00:10:12,023 --> 00:10:13,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, you're just not, eh.

176
00:10:15,045 --> 00:10:17,567
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't own the game, I don't own Xbox.

177
00:10:19,068 --> 00:10:19,488
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay!

178
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:23,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, then let's talk about a story I do know you would know something about, Loki.

179
00:10:24,093 --> 00:10:28,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XI had some news this week because they are under attack!

180
00:10:29,381 --> 00:10:31,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody is DDoSing them.

181
00:10:31,822 --> 00:10:40,605
[SPEAKER_02]: This is also known as the denial of service attacks, where basically somebody is trying to overload the servers with information so that they effectively shut down.

182
00:10:40,905 --> 00:10:42,166
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can personally attest to this.

183
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:45,647
[SPEAKER_02]: I had problems logging in on, I think it was like Tuesday night, I was trying to log in.

184
00:10:45,967 --> 00:10:48,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, you were playing and I was going to try to join you in a party.

185
00:10:49,368 --> 00:10:50,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, I couldn't get in.

186
00:10:50,189 --> 00:10:50,709
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why.

187
00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:52,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody was DDoSing the servers.

188
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:53,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Squeenix!

189
00:10:54,503 --> 00:10:58,665
[SPEAKER_02]: As we fondly refer to them here on the show, they're putting the smack down.

190
00:10:59,145 --> 00:11:04,368
[SPEAKER_02]: They're saying that they have notified law enforcement authorities in Japan, the United States, and Europe.

191
00:11:04,755 --> 00:11:12,339
[SPEAKER_02]: The attack started April 9th, and as of the taping of this podcast, they're still ongoing as far as we know, causing latency and screwy servers.

192
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:14,380
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not happy about that.

193
00:11:14,581 --> 00:11:19,443
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this just some World of Warcraft person that's just pissed off or something?

194
00:11:19,563 --> 00:11:22,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably one of those people that got banned for selling Gil on eBay.

195
00:11:22,525 --> 00:11:23,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was going to say, who would do this?

196
00:11:23,826 --> 00:11:26,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Who would have the motive to DDOS Final Fantasy XI?

197
00:11:26,547 --> 00:11:30,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Because honestly, how many servers are there for Final Fantasy XI?

198
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:31,350
[SPEAKER_02]: There's at least 20 servers.

199
00:11:32,117 --> 00:11:33,718
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to shut the whole game down.

200
00:11:33,758 --> 00:11:39,101
[SPEAKER_02]: You would have to have the entire force of America Online DDoSing these people to shut it down.

201
00:11:39,121 --> 00:11:40,001
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not going to happen.

202
00:11:40,061 --> 00:11:42,602
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do people have to gain from this, do you think?

203
00:11:42,662 --> 00:11:46,785
[SPEAKER_01]: And also each server is just... A server is not necessarily one computer either.

204
00:11:46,805 --> 00:11:47,665
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.

205
00:11:47,845 --> 00:11:48,966
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a cluster of them.

206
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:55,009
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you'll see a group of people drop and not everybody...

207
00:11:56,155 --> 00:11:57,416
[SPEAKER_01]: IRC, you know, type of thing.

208
00:11:57,536 --> 00:11:58,156
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think this is?

209
00:11:58,196 --> 00:11:59,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Disgruntled gill seller?

210
00:11:59,956 --> 00:12:00,817
[SPEAKER_02]: World of Warcraft fan base?

211
00:12:00,837 --> 00:12:05,378
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just some loser kid that's trying to, like, I don't know, feel special.

212
00:12:05,398 --> 00:12:07,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone who's playing Rose Online.

213
00:12:08,099 --> 00:12:09,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, stop screwing up my game.

214
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,060
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I have to say.

215
00:12:13,221 --> 00:12:13,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

216
00:12:14,722 --> 00:12:15,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of...

217
00:12:15,615 --> 00:12:15,795
[SPEAKER_02]: But... But...

218
00:12:43,542 --> 00:12:44,903
[SPEAKER_02]: It's starring The Rock.

219
00:12:45,063 --> 00:12:46,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is starring The Rock.

220
00:12:46,263 --> 00:12:47,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, that's cool.

221
00:12:47,544 --> 00:12:51,786
[SPEAKER_02]: And Carl Urban, who is in Lord of the Rings, Return of the King, and Born Supremacy.

222
00:12:52,107 --> 00:12:58,690
[SPEAKER_02]: The director of this movie, Andrzej Bartokwek, I hope I... I know I totally mispronounced that, so I apologize.

223
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:02,172
[SPEAKER_02]: But he directed the movies Cradle to the Grave and Exit Wounds.

224
00:13:02,652 --> 00:13:03,953
[SPEAKER_02]: So, should be interesting.

225
00:13:04,013 --> 00:13:06,074
[SPEAKER_01]: We, like, have, like, some, you know...

226
00:13:06,874 --> 00:13:08,775
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the hip-hop artists in this movie.

227
00:13:08,795 --> 00:13:12,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was going to say, didn't both those movies star hip-hop stars?

228
00:13:12,676 --> 00:13:14,177
[SPEAKER_02]: I know one of them starred 50 Cent.

229
00:13:14,197 --> 00:13:16,638
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting thug-doomed, that's it.

230
00:13:16,998 --> 00:13:21,580
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're going to be having some hip-hop interlude action sequence or something like that.

231
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Doom, yo.

232
00:13:24,731 --> 00:13:29,073
[SPEAKER_02]: This is cool if you're into art, modern art especially, and gaming.

233
00:13:29,113 --> 00:13:31,754
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know this is one that might hit home for you, DarkSakura.

234
00:13:32,694 --> 00:13:35,496
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be doing an 8-bit art exhibit.

235
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,837
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to open April 19th.

236
00:13:37,937 --> 00:13:41,058
[SPEAKER_02]: That's this week on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood.

237
00:13:41,098 --> 00:13:41,859
[SPEAKER_02]: It's at Gallery 1988.

238
00:13:41,979 --> 00:13:48,122
[SPEAKER_02]: And the expo is running April 19th through May 20th.

239
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:51,683
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is perfectly timed up so that it's running through the last day of E3.

240
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:52,704
[SPEAKER_03]: It's opening on my birthday.

241
00:13:53,191 --> 00:13:53,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool, yes.

242
00:13:54,452 --> 00:13:59,775
[SPEAKER_02]: And so basically they're going to be hosting a party for E3 attendees as well on May 18th.

243
00:14:00,196 --> 00:14:03,778
[SPEAKER_02]: It's game-related art from more than 100 artists.

244
00:14:03,898 --> 00:14:07,000
[SPEAKER_02]: The gallery is called I Am 8-Bit.

245
00:14:08,421 --> 00:14:10,542
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet there's got to be some Amano art there.

246
00:14:10,722 --> 00:14:11,683
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what's cool about it.

247
00:14:11,723 --> 00:14:17,467
[SPEAKER_02]: The opening will be hosted by Gerardo, also known as Rico Suave.

248
00:14:19,053 --> 00:14:19,574
[SPEAKER_03]: 8-Bit Weapon

249
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,048
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw those guys at Classic Gaming Expo.

250
00:14:35,068 --> 00:14:37,868
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought one of their albums and did a marathon on my show.

251
00:14:37,948 --> 00:14:38,609
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be there.

252
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:39,809
[SPEAKER_02]: So check that out.

253
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:44,610
[SPEAKER_02]: The art will be based on games Pac-Man, Street Fighter 2, Dig Dug.

254
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,331
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got digital prints, paintings, sculpture.

255
00:14:47,931 --> 00:14:50,752
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be just awesome.

256
00:14:50,872 --> 00:15:00,074
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the exhibits will be The Mourning of the Princess by Ryan Bubness and it depicts an unshaven chain-smoking link from The Legend of Zelda.

257
00:15:02,015 --> 00:15:02,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Um

258
00:15:02,788 --> 00:15:16,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Tim Tomkinson made an artwork called Duck Hunter S. Thompson, which will feature the author, Hunter S. Thompson, who made Fear and Loathing Las Vegas, wrote that original story, over a backdrop of the NES light gun classic.

259
00:15:18,119 --> 00:15:19,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.

260
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,261
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to check this out when I'm down in LA for E3.

261
00:15:22,301 --> 00:15:23,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely have to.

262
00:15:23,582 --> 00:15:25,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we've got to plan a trip to that.

263
00:15:25,284 --> 00:15:25,824
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be cool.

264
00:15:26,815 --> 00:15:34,417
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, speaking of E3, Ubisoft has revealed some of the titles they are going to be showing at E3, which includes some next-gen.

265
00:15:34,817 --> 00:15:35,657
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's very cool.

266
00:15:35,697 --> 00:15:42,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the next-gen games are going to be showing Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon 3 and Peter Jackson's King Kong.

267
00:15:42,658 --> 00:15:44,799
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how they're remaking King Kong this year?

268
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:46,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter Jackson, the guy who did Lord of the Rings.

269
00:15:46,339 --> 00:15:49,960
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be making games, and they will be on the next-gen systems.

270
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:55,781
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're finally starting to see... Now, they haven't said which next-gen systems, but a next-gen system, so...

271
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,363
[SPEAKER_02]: We're finally starting to hear some of the games that are coming out.

272
00:15:58,663 --> 00:16:01,246
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of games do you guys hope make it to the next-gen systems?

273
00:16:03,289 --> 00:16:04,050
[SPEAKER_03]: More Tekken.

274
00:16:05,071 --> 00:16:05,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Tekken.

275
00:16:05,692 --> 00:16:06,413
[SPEAKER_01]: Next-gen Tekken.

276
00:16:07,194 --> 00:16:07,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki?

277
00:16:09,185 --> 00:16:14,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, next gen systems, next gen, next gen.

278
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,647
[SPEAKER_01]: How about, well, we know Grand Theft Auto is going to be there.

279
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,268
[SPEAKER_03]: We need more Katamari Damacy.

280
00:16:19,748 --> 00:16:26,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I want to see, I want to see, even though I really want Silent Hill 5, I want to see that.

281
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,790
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see more original stuff like Katamari Damacy.

282
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:32,471
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that all these special next gen things will...

283
00:16:33,672 --> 00:16:37,115
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanna see more original games like Katamari Damacy.

284
00:16:37,135 --> 00:16:38,356
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanna see original stuff.

285
00:17:00,867 --> 00:17:04,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Use this fancy new next-gen technology you're developing to make something new.

286
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,471
[SPEAKER_03]: We need more treasure games.

287
00:17:06,331 --> 00:17:06,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Treasure games?

288
00:17:07,252 --> 00:17:08,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Our pirate hunting games?

289
00:17:08,313 --> 00:17:10,915
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Treasure brought us Gunstar Heroes.

290
00:17:11,035 --> 00:17:12,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the company treasure.

291
00:17:12,376 --> 00:17:13,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Chameleon Twist.

292
00:17:14,197 --> 00:17:17,260
[SPEAKER_03]: They freaking brought us Silhouette Mirage.

293
00:17:18,761 --> 00:17:21,623
[SPEAKER_03]: We need more treasure games, because treasure is awesome.

294
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:24,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Or as my friend says, Treshar.

295
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, do you know what gaming company is cool?

296
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,780
[SPEAKER_02]: At least according to themselves.

297
00:17:30,321 --> 00:17:35,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Majesco, creators of the game Phantom Dust on Xbox, among other things.

298
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:39,342
[SPEAKER_02]: They are changing their NASDAQ stock symbol.

299
00:17:39,362 --> 00:17:40,463
[SPEAKER_02]: This would be the stock exchange.

300
00:17:40,483 --> 00:17:45,444
[SPEAKER_02]: They're changing it from M-J-E-S to C-O-O-L.

301
00:17:46,664 --> 00:17:47,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, funny.

302
00:17:48,384 --> 00:17:51,745
[SPEAKER_02]: So Majesco just wants everybody to know they're cool.

303
00:17:52,498 --> 00:17:53,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Aren't they special?

304
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:56,520
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think that's kind of interesting.

305
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,561
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not as cool as Namco!

306
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:01,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Or several other gaming companies I can think of.

307
00:18:01,842 --> 00:18:04,103
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them being Konami, one of our favorites.

308
00:18:05,324 --> 00:18:09,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Konami just picked up another gaming publisher.

309
00:18:09,586 --> 00:18:11,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Hudson Soft, Konami has picked up.

310
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:12,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Bomberman!

311
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, the makers of Bomberman.

312
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:15,529
[SPEAKER_02]: The games with the Bs.

313
00:18:16,349 --> 00:18:17,730
[SPEAKER_02]: You may also know Hudson Soft as.

314
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,011
[SPEAKER_02]: They made, what, Adventure Island back in the day?

315
00:18:20,251 --> 00:18:20,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.

316
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:23,560
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure what they've done recently outside of Bomberman, I have to admit.

317
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:33,945
[SPEAKER_02]: But Konami and Hudson, they issued a joint statement saying that April 27th, Konami is going to purchase 3 million shares of Hudson's stock.

318
00:18:34,325 --> 00:18:37,966
[SPEAKER_02]: This means that Konami will become the majority stakeholder.

319
00:18:38,026 --> 00:18:42,428
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not quite fusing per se, but... It's a takeover.

320
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:43,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, pretty much.

321
00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:46,470
[SPEAKER_02]: You know it's heading in that direction.

322
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Orange Lounge Radio.

323
00:18:49,151 --> 00:18:55,073
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not just here to fill you in on the latest and greatest in gaming news, but we're also here to better your life.

324
00:18:55,133 --> 00:19:03,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, if all we did is played video games all day, we wouldn't have any time to go out and, you know, get some culture.

325
00:19:04,417 --> 00:19:04,997
[SPEAKER_02]: See art shows.

326
00:19:05,657 --> 00:19:06,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I did that today.

327
00:19:07,578 --> 00:19:10,059
[SPEAKER_02]: So we encourage you to get out once in a while and...

328
00:19:11,736 --> 00:19:15,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Sakura brings you her advice column every single week.

329
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:17,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Sakura, what are you going to be talking about tonight?

330
00:19:19,342 --> 00:19:21,663
[SPEAKER_03]: How to navigate a minefield.

331
00:19:23,405 --> 00:19:21,663
1.

332
00:19:24,045 --> 00:19:26,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep your eyes on your feet.

333
00:19:26,127 --> 00:19:26,107
2.

334
00:19:26,627 --> 00:19:27,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Freeze.

335
00:19:27,228 --> 00:19:28,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not move any farther.

336
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:28,569
3.

337
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:34,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Look for spikes, detonators, wires, bumps, or discoloration in the ground around you. 4.

338
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:41,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Avoid wires, bumps, or discoloration on the ground, and back up slowly in your own footsteps.

339
00:19:41,778 --> 00:19:43,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not turn around.

340
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:44,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Walk backwards.

341
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,120
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what I always say in situations like that?

342
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:47,641
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

343
00:19:48,641 --> 00:19:50,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't freaking go to Eastern Europe.

344
00:19:52,903 --> 00:19:54,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Avoid those minefields altogether.

345
00:19:55,044 --> 00:19:55,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Indeed.

346
00:19:55,824 --> 00:19:56,064
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

347
00:19:57,315 --> 00:20:01,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on in gaming news, you know there's a big movie coming out this summer, The Fantastic Four.

348
00:20:02,216 --> 00:20:03,297
[SPEAKER_02]: They're adapting that comic book.

349
00:20:03,317 --> 00:20:04,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you a fan of The Fantastic Four?

350
00:20:04,757 --> 00:20:05,637
[SPEAKER_03]: I was at one time.

351
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:07,658
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember The Fantastic Four in the 80s.

352
00:20:07,678 --> 00:20:09,518
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember the last movie that came out.

353
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:14,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Activision is actually making a Fantastic Four game.

354
00:20:15,593 --> 00:20:19,336
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've actually been recruiting some musicians to be on the soundtrack.

355
00:20:19,656 --> 00:20:23,279
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have The Explosion with a song called I'm On Fire.

356
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:24,580
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not the soundtrack to the movie.

357
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,981
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the soundtrack to the game.

358
00:20:26,921 --> 00:20:29,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Jurassic 5 with a song called Clobberin' Time.

359
00:20:30,504 --> 00:20:31,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Go Betty Go.

360
00:20:31,545 --> 00:20:33,486
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an all-girl punk rock band if you don't know who they are.

361
00:20:33,906 --> 00:20:39,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Everywhere, and ModRockers Taking Back Sunday will be bringing up Error Operator.

362
00:20:39,787 --> 00:20:44,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the interesting thing is that the songs all kind of go with one of the characters.

363
00:20:45,188 --> 00:20:56,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Error Operator for Mr. Fantastic, the girl punk rock group Everywhere for the Invisible Woman, Jurassic 5 doing the song for The Thing, and I'm on Fire, of course, the Human Torch.

364
00:20:56,491 --> 00:21:00,231
[SPEAKER_03]: But how can a song called Clobber in Time not be for The Thing?

365
00:21:01,352 --> 00:21:02,072
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I don't know.

366
00:21:02,312 --> 00:21:03,452
[SPEAKER_03]: That's his catchphrase.

367
00:21:04,446 --> 00:21:08,055
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just kind of cool that they've got little songs to go with each character.

368
00:21:08,115 --> 00:21:09,138
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just cute.

369
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,065
[SPEAKER_02]: There's really no other way I can describe that, I'm sorry.

370
00:21:14,363 --> 00:21:15,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Pac-Man's coming back.

371
00:21:15,463 --> 00:21:17,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Pac-Man is going to be on the DS.

372
00:21:17,524 --> 00:21:20,865
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like we get a new Pac-Man game of some type every year, just something crazy.

373
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,886
[SPEAKER_02]: This is actually not the Pac-Pix game, though.

374
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:23,566
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something different.

375
00:21:23,586 --> 00:21:26,627
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Pac-N-Roll, and it's coming out on the DS.

376
00:21:26,687 --> 00:21:29,709
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, for one, am impressed that there's actually a new game coming out on the DS.

377
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:32,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this that one that I was crazy about at the E3 demo?

378
00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:33,490
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that was the Pac-Pix one.

379
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,270
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a little bit different.

380
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:41,893
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Pac-N-Roll, and what Pac-N-Roll does is that you basically play a rounded Pac-Man, and you go around colorful worlds.

381
00:21:42,313 --> 00:21:48,140
[SPEAKER_02]: You use the DS touchscreen and stylus, so it's kind of like you're running Pac-Man through 3D worlds.

382
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,441
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of neat.

383
00:21:50,362 --> 00:21:52,765
[SPEAKER_02]: So pack and roll, we'll be using, of course, the stylus.

384
00:21:52,865 --> 00:21:54,387
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of roll it around there with that.

385
00:21:54,487 --> 00:21:55,929
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of like the trackball thing.

386
00:21:56,089 --> 00:21:57,190
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one I was wanting.

387
00:21:57,558 --> 00:22:00,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I thought you were talking about the one where you actually draw the Pac-Man.

388
00:22:00,661 --> 00:22:02,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my bad, my bad.

389
00:22:02,142 --> 00:22:04,444
[SPEAKER_03]: I was all about the Marble Madness looking game.

390
00:22:04,584 --> 00:22:17,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when you went and saw the DS at E3, did you get to go... Remember E3 last year, they had the cool line, like random people got to go in the cool line that would see all the games, and some people got to go in the not-so-cool line where they only saw WarioWare?

391
00:22:17,634 --> 00:22:18,755
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the one I ended up being in.

392
00:22:18,775 --> 00:22:19,716
[SPEAKER_02]: I sort of snuck over.

393
00:22:19,876 --> 00:22:20,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you snuck over?

394
00:22:20,697 --> 00:22:22,378
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how you saw this, because I didn't see this.

395
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:24,139
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the Pac-Pix, though.

396
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,380
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also saw a...

397
00:22:26,773 --> 00:22:28,994
[SPEAKER_03]: A picture that someone snuck.

398
00:22:30,815 --> 00:22:31,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Scandalous.

399
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:31,796
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

400
00:22:33,036 --> 00:22:33,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.

401
00:22:33,997 --> 00:22:38,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Pack and Roll will include the original Pac-Man arcade game, just for the heck of it.

402
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:43,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Because just like Linux, Pac-Man has to show up on every system available out there.

403
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:44,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Indeed.

404
00:22:45,603 --> 00:22:46,183
[SPEAKER_02]: What can you say?

405
00:22:46,243 --> 00:22:48,224
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the granddaddy of video games.

406
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:50,422
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the granddaddies.

407
00:22:50,442 --> 00:22:54,805
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's the Gradius game that we saw at friggin' E3 last year for the DS?

408
00:22:54,945 --> 00:22:55,826
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I wanna know.

409
00:22:56,006 --> 00:22:57,247
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, I wanna see that too.

410
00:22:57,267 --> 00:22:58,087
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what we need?

411
00:22:58,608 --> 00:23:00,649
[SPEAKER_03]: What the whole Gradius series needs?

412
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:02,431
[SPEAKER_03]: A new Parodius.

413
00:23:03,452 --> 00:23:04,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that'd be great.

414
00:23:04,813 --> 00:23:06,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Or like KO Flying Squadron 2.

415
00:23:07,635 --> 00:23:08,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, there was one.

416
00:23:08,516 --> 00:23:10,057
[SPEAKER_03]: We need like a new KO Flying Squadron.

417
00:23:10,677 --> 00:23:11,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Or a new Cotton game.

418
00:23:13,396 --> 00:23:19,481
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some news tonight, lastly, about the, actually, no, not lastly, almost lastly, Next Gen Xbox.

419
00:23:20,602 --> 00:23:21,643
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a couple stories here.

420
00:23:21,963 --> 00:23:25,326
[SPEAKER_02]: One of these stories has to do with Tetsuya Mitsugushi.

421
00:23:26,106 --> 00:23:30,350
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the guy who helped out with Space Channel 5 and Rez.

422
00:23:31,891 --> 00:23:34,293
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't just help out, he actually produced these games.

423
00:23:34,894 --> 00:23:39,117
[SPEAKER_02]: He actually announced recently that he's going to be doing games for the Next Gen Xbox.

424
00:23:39,517 --> 00:23:40,298
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the thing.

425
00:23:40,865 --> 00:23:43,207
[SPEAKER_02]: They will not be music-oriented titles.

426
00:23:43,768 --> 00:23:44,849
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big title coming out this week.

427
00:23:44,869 --> 00:23:53,718
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of a surprise when you consider that Space Channel 5 and Rez are right there, probably the two most underrated music titles of all time.

428
00:23:54,098 --> 00:23:55,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Rez had the vibrator thingy.

429
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's going trans-vibrator all the way.

430
00:23:58,863 --> 00:24:01,726
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully whatever he does will be with the vibration still, huh?

431
00:24:04,316 --> 00:24:12,483
[SPEAKER_02]: He has commented in a recent interview that he sees the next generation consoles not just new machines, but as the point of a major shift in gaming history.

432
00:24:12,823 --> 00:24:16,386
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, I believe that we are at a historical turning point in gaming.

433
00:24:16,787 --> 00:24:24,313
[SPEAKER_02]: If we were to look back at today and the not too distant future, I believe that we will be saying to ourselves, ah, so that was the first step that led to the major changes.

434
00:24:24,934 --> 00:24:30,459
[SPEAKER_01]: This time, the Xbox will fit not four, but six family members inside of it.

435
00:24:32,016 --> 00:24:37,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you been following the, what's that called, that Xbox thing, the online?

436
00:24:37,298 --> 00:24:38,178
[SPEAKER_01]: The ARG.

437
00:24:38,298 --> 00:24:38,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the ARG.

438
00:24:38,918 --> 00:24:39,779
[SPEAKER_01]: The alternate reality game.

439
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:41,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, have you been following that at all?

440
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:42,399
[SPEAKER_02]: The Colony, is that what they're calling it?

441
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:45,541
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thecolony.net or something like that.

442
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:51,382
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have this wonderful web board that I read called nonfiction.com.

443
00:24:52,063 --> 00:24:54,964
[SPEAKER_01]: They do all the work for me, and I just watch it from afar.

444
00:24:55,444 --> 00:24:56,924
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of like what I do with Metacortex.

445
00:24:57,284 --> 00:24:59,425
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched it from afar, and that's what I'm doing now.

446
00:25:00,029 --> 00:25:07,134
[SPEAKER_01]: So they showed, what was it, first we found out that the official name for it is going to be the Xbox 360.

447
00:25:07,854 --> 00:25:13,878
[SPEAKER_01]: That it has a really retarded looking white controller for it that's all shiny and it's got some stupid ball on it.

448
00:25:13,898 --> 00:25:14,879
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a trackball.

449
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:16,060
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pure and virginal.

450
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, whatever.

451
00:25:17,521 --> 00:25:22,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, then also the console system is rumored to look like one of those stupid...

452
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:24,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

453
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:45,055
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we need to get rid of these console systems.

454
00:25:45,235 --> 00:25:48,376
[SPEAKER_01]: Xbox is like, hey, we can stick our Xbox inside of those things.

455
00:25:48,436 --> 00:25:49,777
[SPEAKER_01]: And boom, there you go.

456
00:25:49,817 --> 00:25:51,277
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still getting email for the Phantom.

457
00:25:51,338 --> 00:25:52,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever happened to the Phantom?

458
00:25:52,398 --> 00:25:53,498
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought the Phantom was supposed to be out by now.

459
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:54,459
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still getting email for them.

460
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:55,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's coming out.

461
00:25:55,779 --> 00:25:57,160
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what the title game is going to be?

462
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Duke Nukem Forever.

463
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,821
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm just kidding.

464
00:26:01,081 --> 00:26:01,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's a joke.

465
00:26:01,801 --> 00:26:02,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I get it.

466
00:26:02,902 --> 00:26:03,522
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a funny joke.

467
00:26:03,682 --> 00:26:05,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're both never going to ever come out.

468
00:26:05,743 --> 00:26:06,103
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.

469
00:26:07,504 --> 00:26:11,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, speaking of the Xbox 360s, analysts are saying...

470
00:26:12,147 --> 00:26:22,592
[SPEAKER_02]: 3 million Xboxes could possibly be shipped by Christmas, especially if the system is targeted under $300, which is where they are targeting this new system to be at.

471
00:26:22,612 --> 00:26:24,733
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be priced around $249 to $299.

472
00:26:26,473 --> 00:26:33,256
[SPEAKER_02]: They're also saying that the system will be out October or November, and they're analyzing there are 3 million.

473
00:26:33,276 --> 00:26:36,818
[SPEAKER_02]: This is coming from Goldman Sachs Investment Firm.

474
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,959
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a big problem with this system.

475
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:39,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is that?

476
00:26:40,246 --> 00:26:45,550
[SPEAKER_01]: They're rumored talking about a portable hard drive for it to kind of be like sort of an MP3 player type thing.

477
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,291
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like that one bit.

478
00:26:47,511 --> 00:26:50,813
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I buy an Xbox system for gaming.

479
00:26:51,214 --> 00:26:52,855
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't buy it for a media player.

480
00:26:52,895 --> 00:26:54,576
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't buy it for, you know, all this crap.

481
00:26:55,397 --> 00:26:58,138
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be a lot of gimmicky things with this kind of stuff.

482
00:26:58,178 --> 00:27:01,381
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, really, how many media players... I don't know.

483
00:27:01,401 --> 00:27:04,643
[SPEAKER_01]: I sort of see the Xbox as more of a hardcore console system and where...

484
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:12,347
[SPEAKER_01]: People that would have an Xbox would have these like an iPod or a media type thing.

485
00:27:12,467 --> 00:27:17,550
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really see – it's going to be very gimmicky, and I think they've made a lot of bad decisions with this.

486
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:18,551
[SPEAKER_01]: But we'll see.

487
00:27:18,791 --> 00:27:19,291
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

488
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:20,052
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know yet.

489
00:27:20,132 --> 00:27:21,613
[SPEAKER_02]: We only have rumors to go off of right now.

490
00:27:22,533 --> 00:27:22,773
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

491
00:27:23,153 --> 00:27:29,277
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have any opinions or thoughts, feedback, send us an email to go at orangeloungeradio.com.

492
00:27:29,317 --> 00:27:31,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you been checking that email over there?

493
00:27:31,542 --> 00:27:32,263
[SPEAKER_03]: I have.

494
00:27:32,303 --> 00:27:33,784
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been chatting with a couple people.

495
00:27:33,865 --> 00:27:35,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Heard from anybody interesting?

496
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,249
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one of our UK listeners.

497
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:40,211
[SPEAKER_03]: His name is Matthew.

498
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:42,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.

499
00:27:43,074 --> 00:27:51,103
[SPEAKER_03]: He actually was interested in our PSP commentary, although the PSP isn't really out there yet.

500
00:27:51,773 --> 00:27:52,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.

501
00:27:52,413 --> 00:27:53,073
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's cool.

502
00:27:53,093 --> 00:27:56,754
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll try to keep making mentions on progress in the UK.

503
00:27:56,974 --> 00:28:03,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, one of my full side projects I'm still working on is some sort of PSP integration for our website eventually.

504
00:28:04,436 --> 00:28:05,756
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working on it.

505
00:28:05,956 --> 00:28:08,877
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to get my internet up and stuff.

506
00:28:09,037 --> 00:28:09,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good.

507
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:15,198
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, speaking of Orange Launch Radio and our website, we did mention on the show tonight we've had this theme going on of...

508
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,660
[SPEAKER_02]: We are starting over.

509
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,422
[SPEAKER_02]: May 1st is going to bring a lot of changes to OrangeLawsRadio.com.

510
00:28:19,702 --> 00:28:29,545
[SPEAKER_02]: This podcast really isn't going to be changing so much, but our 24-hour, 7-day-a-week live streaming station we have on Live 365 is going to be changing a little bit for the better, we think.

511
00:28:29,766 --> 00:28:31,346
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be more of a broad gaming.

512
00:28:31,406 --> 00:28:34,227
[SPEAKER_02]: So those of you guys that listen to this podcast have something to look forward to.

513
00:28:35,788 --> 00:28:38,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, one more story here tonight.

514
00:28:40,086 --> 00:28:41,127
[SPEAKER_02]: This is interesting here.

515
00:28:41,307 --> 00:28:44,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Games could possibly soon be losing their voice.

516
00:28:45,312 --> 00:28:56,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Online trade magazines are stating that the negotiations between the Screen Actors Guild and game publishers to renew voice acting contracts are kind of on the bubble right now.

517
00:28:56,864 --> 00:28:59,407
[SPEAKER_02]: So this could possibly lead to...

518
00:29:00,327 --> 00:29:01,168
[SPEAKER_02]: A future strike?

519
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:01,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

520
00:29:02,969 --> 00:29:03,989
[SPEAKER_02]: How could this affect things?

521
00:29:04,089 --> 00:29:04,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's look at this.

522
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:09,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Charlize Theron is lending her voice to Majesco's Aeon Flux.

523
00:29:09,793 --> 00:29:12,835
[SPEAKER_02]: David Duchovny, Marilyn Manson are doing voices in Midway's Area 51.

524
00:29:13,996 --> 00:29:18,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Sean Connery is doing some voice acting from Russia With Love from EA.

525
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:19,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

526
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:25,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Marlon Brando did some voice acting, as you may remember, for the Godfather game before it came out.

527
00:29:26,213 --> 00:29:26,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.

528
00:29:27,033 --> 00:29:29,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Variety.com making this report.

529
00:29:30,494 --> 00:29:32,215
[SPEAKER_02]: So, who knows?

530
00:29:32,275 --> 00:29:35,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you be all torn up if actors, famous actors, had to leave video games?

531
00:29:36,376 --> 00:29:40,697
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, the type of games I play, it doesn't really matter to me.

532
00:29:41,217 --> 00:29:42,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes, though, they make the game.

533
00:29:43,557 --> 00:29:44,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes.

534
00:29:44,178 --> 00:29:45,478
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, the Buffy game?

535
00:29:45,698 --> 00:29:47,138
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how crazy I was over that?

536
00:29:47,678 --> 00:29:53,040
[SPEAKER_03]: They had everybody except Sir Michelle Gellar, and that just sort of axed it for me.

537
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:53,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Aww.

538
00:29:54,954 --> 00:30:07,261
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but look at a game like Final Fantasy X. I mean, some pretty decent voice acting in that game from basically folks who maybe they're big on the anime dubbing, but no screen actors really in that group and they're all pretty good.

539
00:30:07,887 --> 00:30:11,708
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing is, is that for The Godfather, you expect Marlon Brando.

540
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:12,168
[SPEAKER_02]: That is true.

541
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:13,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that is true.

542
00:30:13,029 --> 00:30:16,750
[SPEAKER_03]: For Bond, you expect Sean Connery, especially since he's playing Bond in the new movie.

543
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:17,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

544
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:18,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's supposed to be an older Bond.

545
00:30:19,611 --> 00:30:20,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

546
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:21,411
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't heard that one.

547
00:30:21,471 --> 00:30:22,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

548
00:30:22,032 --> 00:30:22,972
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a stretch.

549
00:30:23,072 --> 00:30:23,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

550
00:30:23,732 --> 00:30:24,292
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about that.

551
00:30:24,312 --> 00:30:25,313
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where you heard that one.

552
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:26,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Premier Magazine.

553
00:30:26,653 --> 00:30:28,794
[SPEAKER_01]: The Avengers had Eddie Izzard in it.

554
00:30:29,094 --> 00:30:30,094
[SPEAKER_01]: League of Extraordinary Gentlemen?

555
00:30:56,857 --> 00:30:57,197
[SPEAKER_03]: No, thank you.

556
00:30:57,217 --> 00:30:58,098
[SPEAKER_03]: I needed to see that.

557
00:30:58,938 --> 00:31:03,621
[SPEAKER_01]: How about they just have the wonderful movie Sean Connery Kicks Ass, and that's what it is.

558
00:31:03,701 --> 00:31:07,883
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just him punching one person after another, you know, the end.

559
00:31:08,063 --> 00:31:12,886
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, before we turn into movie chat, I think it's time to end Orange Lounge Radio for this week.

560
00:31:13,206 --> 00:31:14,507
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back next week, though.

561
00:31:14,607 --> 00:31:15,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Final thoughts, Loki?

562
00:31:17,088 --> 00:31:19,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate moving.

563
00:31:21,091 --> 00:31:21,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Sakura?

564
00:31:22,591 --> 00:31:23,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Reject false icons.

565
00:31:24,437 --> 00:31:26,798
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought, I've got so much laundry to do.

566
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:29,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for listening, everybody.

567
00:31:29,219 --> 00:31:31,219
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you next time on the Orange Lounge Radio To-Go Edition.

568
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:36,701
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To-Go Edition.

569
00:31:37,001 --> 00:31:42,563
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com.

570
00:31:43,024 --> 00:31:44,004
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next update.
