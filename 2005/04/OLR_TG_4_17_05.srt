sappy show this week because full of pants well it was it was our um kind of

15
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,580
goodbye to this studio as we evolve orange lounge radio is kind of evolving

16
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:17,500
this podcast is a big part of that we're taking orange lounge radio our internet

17
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:23,220
station we do on life 365 best of life 365 nominated broadcaster the year we're

18
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,300
very excited about that those awards happen in a couple weeks so excited

19
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,980
that we're taking our station on life is

20
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,260
five and kind of revamping it to be a

21
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,340
general video gaming station this

22
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,780
podcast is big part of that again DDR

23
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,700
fans shouldn't be too upset we're still

24
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,540
going to have rhythm music games be a

25
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,940
big big part of that but I believe dark

26
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,140
sacri you said this a couple weeks ago

27
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,260
and I think it describes this whole

28
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,260
thing best we are gamer fans first DDR

29
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,820
fans second yeah that's pretty much it

30
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,380
because DDR fan DDR is a game so we're

31
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,980
we're gamer fans before anything else

32
00:01:53,980 --> 00:02:02,800
else ddr is a subcategory of the gamer so this podcast we do is kind of the

33
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,580
kickoff of that dedicated to other gaming things and we're all here all

34
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,360
three of us are here live in person in studio somebody had asked a question a

35
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,400
while back do you Skype in any of your clothes actually we don't we are all

36
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,780
here live in the flesh so we can interact with each other I'm actually an

37
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:23,880
artificial intelligent program here that just acts like me all right anyway let's

38
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,880
Let's get to it. What's your game of the week been like? Dark Sakura?

39
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,880
I ain't played shit.

40
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,880
Really?

41
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,880
No, um, actually I did play something, now that I think about it. I played the Jeep Simulator

42
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,880
on the Gorillaz site.

43
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,880
You and your web games?

44
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:45,880
It's fun! Because if anyone has seen the 19-2000 video, they're on this big stretch of a highway

45
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:52,880
being chased by aliens and salvation and things like that. And you can actually drive the whole freeway

46
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,720
on. Okay, promise me this week you'll tear yourself on the website to play another game.

47
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,560
You've got a house full of games. I played Legos too. Oh yeah, you can play the Lego

48
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,080
game. I played the Star Wars Lego game and it was really cool because we got enough money

49
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,360
in the game to unlock General Grievous and the next Star Wars movie he's supposed to

50
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,280
kill like these four Jedi and uses their light sabers as his damn weapons and he's got four

51
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,600
arms. It's really rad. So he's like kicking ass all the time and I'm over there using

52
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:30,400
like Anakin all right hi I'm evil no spoilers hi I'm Vader all right anything

53
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,000
else just the Lego game that's kind of it yeah well I'm glad you were able to

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,840
tear yourself away to at least give that a try I'm curious I've been busy with

55
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,480
school I had a lot of crap up I'm not huge on Star Wars I respect the films

56
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,720
but I'm not like oh my god you know they're cool games there's some good

57
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,240
games that come out of the series so I'm curious about this Lego star I think

58
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,160
it's kind of hilarious the whole concept Lego meets Star Wars I think is the

59
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,840
dumbest thing I've ever seen it was really stupid looking but it was fun it

60
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,800
was really fun is what games are all about though okay good make a fun game

61
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,800
that could be Star Wars not featuring Legos intelligent cube was a stupid

62
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,520
looking game because I was like all of these falling cubes but it's it's one of

63
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,000
the most brilliant PlayStation games they ever did squadron was fun this is

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,280
why you don't see tickle me Elmo the game I mean that would be stupid but

65
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,280
But that still doesn't stop them from putting Mary-Kate and Ashley games out.

66
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,280
Loki, what's your game of the week been like?

67
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,280
I played Luminous and I played Ridge Racer for the PSV.

68
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,280
And they're fun. Lots of fun.

69
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:39,280
Ridge Racer's pretty cool because it's like a throwback to the old R4, which is the best one I think that was available for the original PlayStation.

70
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,280
And then they have R5 tracks in there as well. Those are pretty good.

71
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,560
And then, you know, I guess you could unlock the intros for both of those games as well.

72
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,040
It's just a lot of fun.

73
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,680
Gotta play it against my boss, kicked his ass by 10 seconds.

74
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,200
Just, I had never actually played the game when I played him, and

75
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,320
I mean, he's not that much. I mean, he's a gamer, but

76
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,240
he's probably just not as hardcore as I am, so.

77
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,480
Oh well. And then, Luminous is

78
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,120
interesting. It's like, so simple, but you can kinda

79
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,820
screw yourself up pretty easy on it. So, it's interesting. It's just something you gotta play, I guess.

80
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,820
And then I also put Robot Chicken, five episodes of it, on my PSP.

81
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,120
Doing the hacksaw thing? Elite hacksawing?

82
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,120
Not really. I mean, it's a feature of the PSP. They put video on it. So, that's what I did.

83
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,120
Alright.

84
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:37,120
Um, you know, my gaming week was kind of similar, where, um, I actually played Donkey Konga this week over at, uh, my buddy's house.

85
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,620
We were playing Donkey Konga, and I haven't played Donkey Konga a whole lot. Like, maybe this is like my second or third time playing it.

86
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:47,300
But I was playing all the crazy songs. It's kind of like how Loki was kicking ass at Ridge Racer his first time playing it

87
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:53,580
Just because I've played so many of the rhythm beat games and since I'd played Taiko no Tatujin before which is Taiko drum master

88
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,460
Which is basically the same thing as Donkey Konga just in a different setup

89
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:02,540
I had no problem clearing the difficult song so they were going like how are you doing that you second time playing?

90
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,540
Oh my god. What's wrong?

91
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:11,020
Also during my gaming week. I also played a little bit of luminous which wow that game is just it really is

92
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:16,120
this amazing as everybody says it is so addicting it's seizure inducing at times

93
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,360
but once you get the hang of it there are some very good I would highly

94
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:26,520
recommend over on game facts calm game faqs calm they have some luminous facts

95
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,980
and you wouldn't think that a puzzle game would need it but when you read it

96
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:33,800
it really improved my game I was not able to get past the second skin but

97
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:39,280
then when I read the FAQs I was up to like skin number 10 on my next game so I

98
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,880
I highly recommend checking that out and I have not been able to get the song shining out of my head

99
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,560
That's the song that plays in the first stage the mono groso song you beat shiny

100
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,760
The songs are addicting you get stuck in your head. So big props to luminous and of course Final Fantasy 11

101
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,840
I've been getting sucked back into that. What can I say? I'm an addict

102
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,920
Alright, let's get into some gaming news. Did you you had another thought a minute ago Dark Sakura?

103
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,840
I want to make sure if I did I forgot what it was. No biggie

104
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,680
Speaking of leaked hack-soring of the PSP, we're going to start off tonight with a story

105
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,960
on the PSP.

106
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:17,600
This is posted on psphacks.blogspot.com.

107
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:24,520
It's the PSP Home Control Version 1.0, and it's actually a way that you can control your

108
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,420
DVD player, TiVo, and high-definition television, all from your PSP.

109
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,400
It's what some guy did.

110
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,120
He made graphics in Photoshop and everything crazy.

111
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,220
actually controlling devices using his PSP not something for everybody of

112
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,380
course it's using the wipeout hacks to be able to do this not something for

113
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:47,900
everybody but certainly shows the potential the PSP has as a device if it

114
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,740
can do this with a little bit of tweaking it's only a matter of time

115
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,420
before some of these features come into the mainstream so this is kind of neat

116
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:57,100
one of the things that's actually pretty cool that's coming out later on is a

117
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,500
game where you can actually make your own game sort of the memory cards and

118
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,900
and then probably upload it to the internet and all that wonderful stuff.

119
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,300
Oh, that's going to unleash a whole other community upon itself.

120
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,100
That's going to be interesting.

121
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,100
Like the RPG makers or fighter makers?

122
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,100
Or ZZT if you want to get really old school.

123
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,100
But... oh my god.

124
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,100
Port that to the...

125
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:20,700
Oh, please somebody stop porting Linux and start porting ZZT.

126
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,200
Why the hell...

127
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,700
If you have any idea what I'm talking about, please port ZZT to the PSP.

128
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,700
Too many acronyms, I know.

129
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,700
Eh, put Linux on your toaster.

130
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:34,700
Anyway, if you want to check that out again, it's psphacks, all one word,.blogspot.com.

131
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,700
Moving on, Halo 2 is going to be getting a big update this week.

132
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:42,700
This Monday, Bungie's putting out a brand new patch for Halo 2.

133
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,700
This is going to be pretty big because they're actually going to alter the way some of the weapons work.

134
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,700
They're going to be doing some changes with the melee damage,

135
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,700
they're going to be changing the way grenades work a little bit,

136
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,700
the fuse timer's going to be tightened up a little bit,

137
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,700
and the damage caused is going to be increased.

138
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,540
they're just changing some other things here and there there's a whole FAQ

139
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,700
available in the news section at Bungie.net but of course you will be

140
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:09,660
forced to auto update on Monday when this patch rolls out what else I think

141
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:14,060
is kind of interesting about this is in the FAQs it actually says that they will

142
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:19,340
be resetting the leaderboards when this auto update is rolled out and the reason

143
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:22,860
why they're saying they're doing this too many hacks out there right now too

144
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,540
many people taking abuse of the glitches that are on there right now the default

145
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,420
the leaderboards kind of one it's one aspect is a pretty big answer here I'd

146
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:36,220
urge you guys to check it out if you're a halo fan over at bungee net but

147
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,380
they're basically gonna reset to kind of give everyone a fair shot since they are

148
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:43,060
tweaking the rules although they say to the casual player which would be me I

149
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:46,760
think I fall in this category because I suck at halo you won't even notice the

150
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,860
difference something the hardcore players are gonna notice the difference

151
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,840
in I bet neither of you care because you don't play halo at all do you halo makes

152
00:09:54,840 --> 00:10:00,060
me throw up. I like Halo. I like Halo, but it makes me motion sick. Ah, so it's not,

153
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,820
you don't throw up because you hate the game. I literally get so motion sick that I would

154
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:08,440
like to, you know, remove the contents of my lunch from my stomach and offer it to the

155
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:15,440
porcelain goddess on my knees. Loki, you're just not, eh, eh. I mean, I don't own the

156
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:22,700
game, I don't own Xbox. Yay. Alright, then let's talk about a story I do know you would

157
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,020
know something about Loki.

158
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,640
Final Fantasy XI had some news this week

159
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,300
because they are under attack.

160
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,820
Somebody is DDoSing them.

161
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,260
This is also known as the denial of service attacks

162
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,660
where basically somebody is trying to overload

163
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,880
the servers with information

164
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,780
so that they effectively shut down.

165
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,220
And I can personally attest to this.

166
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,740
I had problems logging in on,

167
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,860
I think it was like Tuesday night,

168
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,920
I was trying to log in.

169
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,700
Remember, you were playing and I was gonna try

170
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,620
to join you in a party, Loki.

171
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,780
I couldn't get in, this is why.

172
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,000
somebody who was DDOSing the servers.

173
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,840
Squeenix, as we fondly refer to them here on this show,

174
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,100
they're putting the smack down.

175
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,600
They're saying that they have notified

176
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,680
law enforcement authorities in Japan,

177
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,720
the United States, and Europe.

178
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,440
The attack started April 9th,

179
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,040
and as of the taping of this podcast,

180
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,280
they're still ongoing as far as we know,

181
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,620
causing latency and screwy servers.

182
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,040
So they're not happy about that, and...

183
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,200
Is this just some World of Warcraft person

184
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,480
that's just pissed off or something?

185
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,320
Who would do this?

186
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,520
people that got banned for selling Gil on eBay.

187
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,820
Yeah, I was gonna say, who would do this?

188
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,520
Who would have the motive to DDoS Final Fantasy 11?

189
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,360
Because honestly, how many servers are there

190
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,200
for Final Fantasy 11?

191
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,960
There's like at least 20.

192
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,760
You're not gonna shut the whole game down.

193
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,720
You would have to have the entire force of America Online

194
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,160
DDoSing these people to shut it down.

195
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,040
That's not gonna happen.

196
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,640
So what do people have to gain from this, you think?

197
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,440
And also each server's just,

198
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,840
it's server's not necessarily one computer either.

199
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,760
It's true.

200
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,000
It's like a cluster of them, so.

201
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,400
It's that's why that's why you'll see like a group of people drop and not everybody kind of like

202
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,920
IRC type of thing what do you think this is disgruntled gill seller world of warcraft fan base or kid that's trying to like I don't know

203
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:11,620
Rose online well stop screwing up my game. That's what I have to say um

204
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,360
moving on

205
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,600
Kind of along the same lines as halo. We were talking about a minute ago another first-person shooter

206
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,180
that's insanely popular Doom 3 they're making a movie out of the Doom

207
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,920
franchise but it got pushed back it's not coming out in June after all it's

208
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,680
actually being pushed back to October 21st is it gonna bite as much as House

209
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,280
of the Dead I hope not it's coming out October 21st from Universal Pictures

210
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:44,120
it's not being directed by Uwe Boll so this movie has a shot but it's starring

211
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:49,380
The Rock yes it is starring The Rock that's cool and Carl Urban who is in

212
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:54,220
Lord of the Rings, Return of the King, and Bourne's Supremacy. The director of this movie,

213
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:59,340
Andruge Bartekwek, I hope I, I know I totally mispronounced that, so I apologize, but he

214
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:03,940
directed the movies Cradle to the Grave and Exit Wounds. So, it should be interesting.

215
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:08,300
Oh, God. We, like, have, like, some, you know, we're, we're the hip-hop artists in this movie.

216
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:12,460
Yeah, I was gonna say, didn't both those, didn't both those movies star, like, hip-hop

217
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:17,100
stars? I know one of them, Star 50 Cent, yeah. We're getting thug-doomed, that's it. And

218
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,280
then they're gonna be like having you know like some hip-hop interlude action

219
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:27,000
sequence or something like that do me oh um this is cool if you're into art

220
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,760
modern art especially and gaming and I know you're this is one that might hit

221
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:36,080
home for you dark Sakura they're gonna be doing an 8-bit art exhibit it's gonna

222
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:41,280
open April 19th that's this week on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood it's a

223
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:48,760
Gallery 1988 and the expo is running April 19th through May 20th and that is

224
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:53,960
perfectly timed up so that's running through the last day of e3 very cool yes

225
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:58,640
and so basically they're gonna be hosting a party for e3 attendees as well

226
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:04,640
on May 18th it's game related art from more than a hundred artists the gallery

227
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:11,200
is called I am 8-bit I bet there's got to be some Amano art there this is what's

228
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:19,000
about it. The opening will be hosted by Gerardo, also known as Rico Suave.

229
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,080
I find it very funny because he wasn't using that as a name at all. It means rich and smooth.

230
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:32,160
Bartended by the Suicide Girls, which is one of those burlesque groups. Also, 8-Bit Weapon.

231
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,720
Cool, I like 8-Bit Weapon.

232
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,960
We saw those guys at Classic Gaming Airspoke.

233
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,000
I bought one of their albums and played a marathon on my show.

234
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
They're going to be there.

235
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,760
So check that out.

236
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,920
The art will be based on games Pac-Man, Street Fighter II, Dig Dug.

237
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,000
They've got digital prints, paintings, sculpture.

238
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,800
This is going to be just awesome.

239
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:56,480
Let's see, one of the exhibits will be The Mourning of the Princess by Ryan Bubniss and

240
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,800
it depicts an unshaven chain smoking Link from The Legend of Zelda.

241
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:09,120
Tim Tomkinson made an artwork called Duck Hunter S. Thompson, which will feature the

242
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,040
author Hunter S. Thompson, who made Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, wrote that original

243
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,260
story, over a backdrop of the NES light gun classic.

244
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,260
Very interesting.

245
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,800
I am actually, I want to check this out when I'm down in LA for E3.

246
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,800

00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,320
Yeah, we gotta plan a trip to that.

248
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,320
That's gonna be cool.

249
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,320
All right, speaking of E3, Ubisoft has revealed some of the titles they are going to be showing

250
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:36,300

You know like we're gonna do a a cool like shooter blah blah blah blah and then do nothing with it

I just want to see more original games like Katamari Damacy. I just want to see original stuff

268
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,960
Use this fancy new next-gen technology. You're developing to make something new

269
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,160
games

270
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,980
Treasure games are pirate hunting. No treasure brought us. Oh our heroes. Oh the company treasure million twist

271
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,800
They freaking brought us

272
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,120
silhouette Mirage

273
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,120
We need more treasure games, because treasure is awesome.

274
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,120
Or as my friend says, Treshar.

275
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,120
Well, do you know what gaming company is cool?

276
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,120
At least according to themselves.

277
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:36,120
Majesco, creators of the game Phantom Dust on Xbox, among other things.

278
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,120
They are changing their NASDAQ stock symbol.

279
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,120
This would be the stock exchange.

280
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:46,120
They're changing it from MJES to COOL.

281
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,120
Oh, funny.

282
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:55,480
funny. So Majesco just wants everybody to know, they're cool. Aren't they special? I

283
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:00,640
think that's kind of interesting. They're not as cool as Namco! Or several other gaming

284
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:06,520
companies I can think of. One of them being Konami, one of our favorites. Konami just

285
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:12,960
picked up another gaming publisher, Hudson Soft Konami has picked up. Bomberman! Yep,

286
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,400
the makers of Bomberman, the games with the B's.

287
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,960
You may also know Hudson Soft as,

288
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,320
they made what, Adventure Island back in the day?

289
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,160
Yeah.

290
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,160
I'm not sure what they've done recently

291
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,400
outside of Bomberman, I have to admit.

292
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,360
But Konami and Hudson, they issued a joint statement

293
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,880
saying that the April 27th,

294
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,120
Konami is going to purchase three million shares

295
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,720
of Hudson's stock, this means that Konami

296
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,080
will become the majority stakeholder.

297
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,800
So they're not quite fusing, per se, but.

298
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,640
It's a takeover.

299
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:48,560
but pretty much you know it's heading in that direction all right orange lounge

00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:23,200
the soundtrack we're gonna have the explosion with a song called I'm on fire

318
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,720
this is not the soundtrack to the movie this is the soundtrack to the game okay

319
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,400
Jurassic five with a song called clobber in time go Betty go it's an all-girl punk

320
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,800
rock band if you don't know who they are everywhere and mod rockers taking back

321
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:44,220
Sunday will be bringing up error operator now the interesting thing is is that the songs all kind of go with one of the

322
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:50,140
Characters error operator for mr. Fantastic the girl punk rock group everywhere for the invisible woman

323
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,040
Jurassic five doing the song for the thing and I'm on fire of course the human torch

324
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,020
You know clobbering time not be for the thing. I don't know. I don't know

325
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:06,160
that's his catchphrase so that's just kind of cool that they've got like

326
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:10,540
little songs to go with each character that's that's just cute there's really

327
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:16,060
no other way I can describe that I'm sorry Pac-Man's coming back Pac-Man is

328
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:19,460
going to be on the DS it seems like we get a new Pac-Man game of some type

329
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,880
every year just something crazy this is actually not the pack picks game though

330
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,180
this is something different it's called pack enroll and it's coming out on the

331
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,220
DS so I for one I'm impressed that there's actually a new game coming out

332
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,540
DS. Is this that one that I was crazy about at the E3 demo? No, that was the PacPix one.

333
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:37,260
This is a little bit different. This is Pac and Roll. And what Pac and Roll does is that

334
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:42,660
you basically, you play a rounded Pac-Man and you go around colorful worlds. You use

335
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:48,020
the DS touch screen and stylus. So it's kind of like you're running Pac-Man through 3D

336
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:52,860
worlds. So that's kind of neat. So Pac and Roll will be using, of course, the stylus.

337
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,180
You kind of roll it around there with that. This was kind of like the trackball thing.

338
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,900
That's the one I was wanting. Oh, was it? Oh, I thought you were talking about the one

339
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:04,340
you actually draw the pac-man oh my bad all about the marble madness looking game

340
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:08,820
now when you went and saw the DS at e3 did you get to go remember e3 last year

341
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,900
they had the cool line like random people got to go in the cool line that

342
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,960
would see like all the games and some people got to go in the not so cool line

343
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,020
where they only saw like WarioWare that was the one I ended up being in oh you

344
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:23,540
snuck over so that's how you saw this because I didn't see this I saw the pack

345
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:33,200
picks though. And I also saw a picture that someone snuck. Ooh, scandalous. Alright, very

346
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,320
interesting. Pac and Roll will include the original Pac-Man arcade game, just, you know,

347
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,000
for the heck of it. Because, you know, just like Linux, Pac-Man has to show up on every

348
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:49,860
system available out there. Indeed. What can you say? It's the granddaddy of video games.

349
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,860
One of the grand daddies.

350
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:55,080
Or just the Gradius game that we saw at friggin' E3 last year for the DS.

351
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,080
That's what I wanna know.

352
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,220
Seriously, I wanna see that too.

353
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,720
You know what we need?

354
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,260
What the whole Gradius series needs?

355
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,260
A new Parodius.

356
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,820
Oh, that'd be great.

357
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,780
Or like, KO Flying Squadron 2.

358
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,520
Actually, there was one.

359
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,700
We need, like, a new KO Flying Squadron.

360
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,440
Or a new Cotton Game.

361
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,100
We have some news tonight, lastly, about the, actually, no, not lastly, almost lastly, uh,

362
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:23,940
next-gen Xbox a couple stories here one of these stories has to do with Tetsuya

363
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:31,100
Mitsugishi okay he's the guy who helped out with Space Channel five and rez okay

364
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:35,300
he didn't just tell Bob he actually produced these games so he actually

365
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:39,620
announced recently that he's gonna be doing games for the next-gen Xbox but

366
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:44,300
here's the thing they will not be music-oriented titles that's a big title

367
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,540
coming out this week that's kind of a surprise when you consider the Space

368
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:52,860
channel 5 and rez are right there probably the two most underrated music

369
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:57,300
titles of all time rez had the vibrator thingy rez he's going trans vibrator all

370
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:04,060
the way so hopefully whatever he does will be with the vibration still huh he

371
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:08,020
has commented in a recent interview that he sees the next generation consoles not

372
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:13,220
just new machines but as the point of a major shift in gaming history he says I

373
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:17,220
believe that we are at a historical turning point in gaming we were to look

374
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,940
back at today in the not-too-distant future I believe that we will be saying

375
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:24,260
to ourselves ah so that was the first step that led to the major major changes

376
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:31,660
this time the Xbox will fit not four but six family members inside of it now you

377
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:38,100
have you been following the what's that called that Xbox paying the online ARG

378
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,900
yes ARG in it reality yeah have you been following that at all the colony is that

379
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:46,460
what they're calling it? Yeah, the colony.net or something like that. Yeah, I have this

380
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:53,960
wonderful web board that I read called nonfiction.com. They do all the work for me, and I just watch

381
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,940
it from afar, kind of like what I did with Metacortex. I watched it from afar, and that's

382
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:05,060
what I'm doing now. So they showed, what was it, first we found out that the official name

383
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:09,960
for it is going to be the Xbox 360, that it has a really retarded looking white controller

384
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,240
for it that's all like shiny and it's got some stupid ball on it looks like a

385
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,040
trackball it's pure and virginal yeah whatever anyways and then also the

386
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:24,600
console systems rumored to look like one of those stupid like pillows that you

387
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,240
would use for your head if you've got bad neck support because it's like it's

388
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,880
some it looks really ugly and that's just the rumor right now it's just a

389
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:38,840
rumor but I have a bad feeling it's gonna look like a really rejected how

390
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,040
How much you wanna bet they just took the Phantom?

391
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:45,520
The Phantom's like, hmm, you know we need to get rid of these console systems, the Xbox

392
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,440
is like, hey, we can stick our Xbox inside of those things, and boom, there you go.

393
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,520
I'm still getting email for the Phantom.

394
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,520
Whatever happened to the Phantom?

395
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,520
I thought the Phantom was supposed to be out by now.

396
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,520
I'm still getting email for them.

397
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,520
Oh, it's coming out.

398
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,560
And you know what this title game's gonna be?

399
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,560
Duke Nukem Forever.

400
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,560
No, just kidding.

401
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,560
Oh, it's a joke.

402
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,560
Oh, I get it.

403
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,560
It was a funny joke.

404
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,560
Because they're both never gonna ever come out, ever.

405
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,560
Yeah, I get it, I get it.

406
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:15,120
speaking of the Xbox 360s analysts are saying three million Xboxes could

407
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,760
possibly be shipped by Christmas especially if the system is targeted

408
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:22,760
under $300 which is where they are targeting this new system to be out will

409
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:28,440
be priced around $249 to $299 they're also saying that the system will be out

410
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:33,500
October or November and they're analyzing their three million this is

411
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,180
coming from Goldman Sachs investment firm.

412
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,140
I have a big problem with this system.

413
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,260
Why is that?

414
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,820
They're rumored talking about portable hard drive

415
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:46,120
for it to kind of be like a sort of an MP3 player type thing.

416
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,500
I don't like that one bit.

417
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:51,220
I mean, I buy an Xbox system for gaming.

418
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,880
I don't buy it for a media player.

419
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,380
I don't buy it for all this crap.

420
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,840
There's going to be a lot of gimmicky things with this kind

421
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,340
of stuff.

422
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:01,020
It's like really how many media players.

423
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:01,520
I don't know.

424
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,400
I sort of see the Xbox as more of a hardcore console system

425
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,520
and where people that would have an Xbox

426
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:11,520
would have these like an iPod or a media type thing.

427
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,480
I don't really see, it's gonna be very gimmicky

428
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,960
and I think they've made a lot of bad decisions with this.

429
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,360
But we'll see, we'll see.

430
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,200
And we don't know yet,

431
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,580
we only have rumors to go off of right now.

432
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:25,360
All right, if you have any opinions or thoughts, feedback,

433
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,880
send us an email to go at orangeloungeradio.com.

434
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,440
You've been checking that email over there?

435
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,440
I have.

436
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,240
I've been chatting with a couple of people.

437
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,240
Heard from anybody interesting?

438
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,840
There's one of our UK listeners, his name is Matthew.

439
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,840
Right on.

440
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,840
He'd like to say hi.

441
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:51,480
He actually was interested in our PSP commentary, although the PSP isn't really out there yet.

442
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,480
Okay.

443
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,480
So that's cool.

444
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,800
We'll try to keep making mentions on progress in the UK.

445
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:02,000
Well you know one of my full side projects I'm still working on is some sort of PSP integration

446
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,880
for our website eventually. I'm working on it. I have to get my internet up and stuff.

447
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,680
Sounds good. By the way, speaking of Orange Launch Radio and our website,

448
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,440
we did mention on the show tonight, we've had this theme going on of,

449
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,520
we are starting over. May 1st is going to bring a lot of changes to OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

450
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,600
This podcast really isn't going to be changing so much, but our 24 hour,

451
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,440
seven-day weeks live streaming station we have on life 365 is going to be

452
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,480
changing a little bit for the better we think gonna be more of a broad gaming so

453
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:37,440
those you guys listen this podcast have something to look forward to anyway one

454
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,680
more story here tonight this is interesting here games could possibly

455
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:48,080
soon be losing their voice online trade magazines are stating that the

456
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:53,080
negotiations between the Screen Actors Guild and game publishers to renew voice

457
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:58,440
acting contracts are kind of on the bubble right now so this could possibly

458
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:04,480
lead to a future strike who knows well how could this affect things well let's

459
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,260
look at this Charlize Theron what is lending her voice to Majesco's a on flux

460
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:14,800
David Duchovny Marilyn Manson are doing voices in Midway's area 51 Sean Connery

461
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:19,320
is doing some voice acting for from Russia with love from EA very cool

462
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:24,680
Marlon Brando did some voice acting as you may remember for the Godfather game

463
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:31,880
before it came out very interesting variety.com making this report hmm so who

464
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,800
knows would you be all torn up if actors famous actors had to leave video games

465
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:41,560
to me it the type of games I play it doesn't really matter to me sometimes

466
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,960
though they make the game sometimes you know like the Buffy game you know how

467
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:51,360
crazy I was over that. They had everybody except Sir Michelle Geller. That just sort

468
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,680
of axed it for me.

469
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:58,860
Aw. I know, but look at a game like Final Fantasy X. I mean, some pretty decent voice

470
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:04,320
acting in that game from basically folks who, maybe they're big on the anime dubbing, but

471
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,060
no screen actors really in that group, and they're all pretty good.

472
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:11,820
But the thing is, is that for The Godfather, you expect Marlon Brando.

473
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,960
That is, okay, that is true.

474
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,040
For Bond, you expect Sean Connery, especially since he's playing Bond in the new movie.

475
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,360
Because it's supposed to be an older Bond.

476
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,360
Interesting.

477
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,360
I haven't heard that one.

478
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,360
Yeah.

479
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,360
That's a stretch.

480
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,360
I don't think so.

481
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,360
I don't know about that.

482
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,360
I don't know where you heard that one.

483
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,360
Uh, Premiere Magazine.

484
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,360
Hmm.

485
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,360
Sounds like a rumor to me.

486
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,360
Sounds like a rumor to me.

487
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,360
We'll see.

488
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,360
I've heard something completely different.

489
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,120
It's based off of one of the original Bond novels that featured him as a retiree.

490
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,900
That I heard, but I heard like Pierce Brosnan was coming back and then I heard they got

491
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,160
some new guy.

492
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,320
We won't know anything until they release the official press release.

493
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,320
It's all speculation.

494
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,320
Who cares?

495
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,000
Because it's Sean Connery, he could be a quadruple amputee and still be hot.

496
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,840
You know, he should go back to doing Bond movies.

497
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,840
What else has he done lately?

498
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,840
He did the, uh...

499
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,840
The Avengers?

500
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,840
Yeah.

501
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,840
Hey, the Avengers had Eddie Izzard in it.

502
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,840
What was the other one?

503
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,840
The, uh, uh...

504
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,840
League of Extraordinary Gentlemen?

505
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,840
No, thank you.

506
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,000
I needed to see that.

507
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,160
How about they just have the wonderful movie Sean Connery Kicks Ass, and that's, that's

508
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,160
what it is.

509
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,960
It's just him punching one person after another, you know, the end.

510
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:12,160
Alright, before we turn into movie chat, I think it's time to end Orange Lounge Radio

511
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,160
for this week.

512
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,760
We'll be back next week, though.

513
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,580
Final thoughts, Loki?

514
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:21,200
I hate moving.

515
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,560
Dark Sakura?

516
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,420
Reject false icons.

517
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,420
My final thought?

518
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:28,280
I've got so much laundry to do.

519
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,280
Thanks for listening, everybody.

520
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,320
We'll see you next time on the Orange Lounge Radio To-Go Edition.

521
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:37,080
That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To-Go Edition.

522
