[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

04:47.585 --> 04:47.885
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway.

04:50.047 --> 04:50.387
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

04:50.407 --> 04:51.707
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a personal question, honey.

04:51.767 --> 04:52.508
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't answer that.

04:52.888 --> 04:53.528
[SPEAKER_15]: Shut up.

04:54.789 --> 04:56.450
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure she keeps up with plenty of fiber.

04:57.020 --> 05:01.601
[SPEAKER_06]: Also joining us tonight, we have another special guest who just walked into the studio here.

05:02.381 --> 05:10.663
[SPEAKER_07]: Say hello to our resident... I don't know, he's our resident... We need a title for him, I don't know.

[SPEAKER_15]: Pepsi Bringer.

05:12.223 --> 05:13.083
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Pepsi Bringer.

05:13.163 --> 05:20.605
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's a staff member over on the DDR Freak and a well-known community member, long-time player.

05:20.645 --> 05:21.445
[SPEAKER_07]: Say hello to Islander.

05:21.665 --> 05:21.985
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

05:22.005 --> 05:22.105
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

05:22.708 --> 05:23.329
[SPEAKER_07]: How you doing, sir?

05:23.549 --> 05:24.590
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing just fine, yourself?

05:24.850 --> 05:25.150
[SPEAKER_06]: Good!

05:25.791 --> 05:35.238
[SPEAKER_07]: I am a little sad, though, because as you have heard, the rumors are true, tonight is the last episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

05:36.599 --> 05:37.340
[SPEAKER_07]: From this studio.

05:38.000 --> 05:43.005
[SPEAKER_36]: So... I was about to say, all the more reason I'm here, but alright.

05:43.605 --> 05:46.988
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, we are starting over.

05:49.069 --> 05:49.530
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually...

05:50.359 --> 06:02.085
[SPEAKER_07]: This is, yeah, actually that's kind of the theme of tonight, is we are starting over, because we're saying goodbye to this studio that served us well for the past two years of the show, and we're going to be moving into a new studio in two weeks.

06:02.345 --> 06:04.887
[SPEAKER_07]: We're actually not going to be here next week, we'll talk about that a little more in a little bit.

06:06.768 --> 06:11.430
[SPEAKER_07]: But this place right now is, I would say it's empty, but it's really not.

06:11.490 --> 06:15.252
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like the remnants of a tsunami in this place, to be honest.

06:15.472 --> 06:16.673
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how else to explain it.

06:16.733 --> 06:17.013
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki...

06:19.102 --> 06:21.864
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like any house that you would see on Cops.

06:23.585 --> 06:24.725
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good way of putting it.

06:25.306 --> 06:26.366
[SPEAKER_15]: With wires everywhere.

06:26.947 --> 06:29.168
[SPEAKER_15]: And a hidden stash of heroin in Loki's room.

06:31.429 --> 06:34.751
[SPEAKER_03]: My room literally has a pile of crap on top of the bed.

06:34.831 --> 06:40.795
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like this giant pile of clothes and records and God, who knows what.

06:41.095 --> 06:47.399
[SPEAKER_15]: I instantly was, I knew better because I've actually known someone who has a pile of real crap on his bed from his cat.

06:49.389 --> 06:50.269
[SPEAKER_15]: It was very gross.

06:51.010 --> 06:52.470
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a friend of mine's ex-boyfriend.

06:54.011 --> 07:01.854
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, so our webcam tonight, unfortunately, because of the move going on, we're actually missing... The arcade cabinet is no longer here in the studio.

07:01.954 --> 07:03.955
[SPEAKER_07]: The couch is no longer here in the studio.

07:04.235 --> 07:06.096
[SPEAKER_15]: We tried to hook up the Shamu cam.

07:06.556 --> 07:07.657
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the coffee table.

07:07.857 --> 07:11.238
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're... There's no computer to run a webcam.

07:11.378 --> 07:13.559
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the PlayStation 2 is not even here anymore.

07:13.599 --> 07:16.681
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the computer is in the...

07:17.870 --> 07:19.411
[SPEAKER_03]: The kitchen, for some reason.

07:22.272 --> 07:23.933
[SPEAKER_07]: It's toasting something, apparently.

07:24.013 --> 07:24.493
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

07:24.994 --> 07:27.315
[SPEAKER_03]: My other computer is over here next to the chair.

07:27.495 --> 07:29.376
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an Amiga, suddenly, and it wants toast.

07:29.516 --> 07:32.437
[SPEAKER_07]: The metal dance pads are in the bathroom.

07:34.479 --> 07:37.040
[SPEAKER_07]: I went in to take a shower today, and I'm like, what the fuck?

07:37.180 --> 07:39.201
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a dance pad on the floor.

07:41.882 --> 07:42.423
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a mess.

07:42.723 --> 07:46.205
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, so we would love to show this to you guys on webcam, but we have no way to do it.

07:46.585 --> 07:46.965
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, we do.

07:47.850 --> 07:49.891
[SPEAKER_15]: I have the transfer cable and my telephone.

07:53.011 --> 07:58.113
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so maybe we'll figure something out, but for now... I really am too lazy to do that.

07:58.153 --> 08:01.234
[SPEAKER_07]: For now, we're patching in the Sacramento webcam.

08:01.834 --> 08:03.494
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can see the town where we live.

08:05.355 --> 08:10.256
[SPEAKER_15]: All I need is an STP program or someone to put it up somewhere for me.

08:10.636 --> 08:12.897
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'll take pictures with my cell phone.

08:13.864 --> 08:14.985
[SPEAKER_07]: Watch Desperate House what?

08:15.025 --> 08:17.667
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually don't, because that's on right now.

08:17.687 --> 08:18.547
[SPEAKER_07]: Watch... What other shows are on ABC?

08:41.733 --> 08:47.058
[SPEAKER_07]: Watch Lost Wednesday night at some time on News 10.

08:47.718 --> 08:50.100
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless you're not in Sacramento, then I guess you're screwed.

08:50.921 --> 08:52.302
[SPEAKER_15]: Followed by Temple of Butt.

08:52.643 --> 08:53.003
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

08:54.644 --> 08:57.267
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, watch The Bachelorette because nobody else is.

08:58.628 --> 08:59.889
[SPEAKER_15]: Speaking of Temple of Butt...

09:01.605 --> 09:02.767
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be back after this.

09:37.674 --> 09:40.196
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for watching

10:16.241 --> 10:17.302
Disperse Disperse

10:46.991 --> 10:48.012
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for watching!

11:21.841 --> 11:22.874
Thanks for watching!

11:49.148 --> 11:50.150
[SPEAKER_24]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

12:18.072 --> 12:19.672
I like the way it's a dudley

12:54.242 --> 12:54.991
Thanks for watching!

15:07.785 --> 15:08.265
[SPEAKER_35]: and DarkSakura.

15:34.057 --> 15:34.938
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, man.

15:36.219 --> 15:37.180
[SPEAKER_27]: All is good in the world.

15:37.260 --> 15:37.840
[SPEAKER_27]: All is good.

15:38.121 --> 15:38.421
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds good.

15:38.441 --> 15:39.262
[SPEAKER_27]: For the most part.

15:40.262 --> 15:40.863
[SPEAKER_07]: For the most part.

15:41.604 --> 15:42.765
[SPEAKER_27]: That's why we have F.E.s later.

15:42.785 --> 15:44.266
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, we'll hear about the other half during F.E.s.

15:44.486 --> 15:47.308
[SPEAKER_07]: And also joining us, of course, where there's Mel B, there's Shark Skrull.

15:47.649 --> 15:48.429
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, guys.

15:48.529 --> 15:49.350
[SPEAKER_07]: How you doing, hon?

15:50.091 --> 15:51.772
[SPEAKER_16]: I brought Lumines for you to ogle.

15:53.153 --> 15:54.114
[SPEAKER_07]: He actually has it, too.

15:54.214 --> 15:55.335
[SPEAKER_07]: I've already played it.

15:55.635 --> 15:57.016
[SPEAKER_07]: But you guys should do the wireless thing.

15:57.036 --> 15:57.497
[SPEAKER_07]: That might be fun.

15:57.517 --> 16:00.800
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, at least you're not going to be, like, obsessing over me just for my PSP.

16:01.934 --> 16:03.994
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to tell that story on the air because it's too funny.

16:04.455 --> 16:05.235
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll make you tell that later.

16:05.655 --> 16:08.375
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you should go check out his games.

16:08.395 --> 16:09.095
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got quite a few.

16:09.436 --> 16:12.336
[SPEAKER_16]: So, anyway.

16:12.596 --> 16:15.437
[SPEAKER_16]: Dude!

16:16.177 --> 16:16.697
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell?

16:16.737 --> 16:18.597
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that a Genesis portable thing?

16:18.777 --> 16:19.698
[SPEAKER_15]: A Nomad?

16:20.858 --> 16:21.818
[SPEAKER_15]: I have one of those, too.

16:22.758 --> 16:26.679
[SPEAKER_15]: And you know that you can use the Game Gear battery pack on this, too.

16:28.314 --> 16:32.016
[SPEAKER_07]: This is like portable gaming convention in the tsunami zone tonight here.

16:33.277 --> 16:41.542
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm just checking out Moonwalker on the Nomad, and all I gotta say is, man, in times like these, who better of a superhero than a psychotic pedophile?

16:44.864 --> 16:47.906
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, in that break...

16:49.497 --> 16:55.839
[SPEAKER_07]: In that break, we heard Jesper Kidd with the Tengoku remix, or as some folks call it, .59.

16:56.600 --> 16:59.741
[SPEAKER_07]: Before that, Akira Yamaoka, 250 BPM.

17:00.261 --> 17:02.262
[SPEAKER_07]: Before that, DJ Naguro, Lin, 1999.

17:02.322 --> 17:03.662
[SPEAKER_07]: And starting us off, DJ Simon, 321 Stars.

17:06.503 --> 17:10.507
[SPEAKER_07]: All songs with numbers in them that break, because we're just stretching for themes tonight.

17:11.888 --> 17:15.791
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, this is the final night here in this studio.

17:15.811 --> 17:21.536
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be moving to a brand new studio in the next town over, Rancho Cambodia.

17:21.796 --> 17:22.957
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, I'm sorry, Rancho Cordova.

17:22.977 --> 17:25.059
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

17:27.284 --> 17:28.144
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

17:48.413 --> 17:50.453
[SPEAKER_07]: Look forward to that in future episodes and future webcams.

17:50.714 --> 17:53.235
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, though, the webcam tonight, not working.

17:53.795 --> 17:58.977
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead, we've patched through the Channel 10's Sacramento webcam, so you can just check out the river.

18:01.138 --> 18:01.839
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you really?

18:01.859 --> 18:03.259
[SPEAKER_07]: I was there earlier today.

18:03.359 --> 18:05.020
[SPEAKER_07]: And watch it slowly get darker.

18:06.261 --> 18:07.241
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.

18:07.601 --> 18:08.662
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, isn't it fascinating?

18:09.042 --> 18:12.584
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about as exciting as our usual webcam when there's no guests here.

18:14.204 --> 18:15.605
[SPEAKER_07]: Where you get to watch the couch all night.

18:16.779 --> 18:20.201
[SPEAKER_07]: and then you can see it slowly get darker outside anyway

18:22.884 --> 18:28.468
[SPEAKER_07]: Since we won't be in this new studio technically for two weeks, we are not going to be here next week.

18:29.068 --> 18:31.370
[SPEAKER_07]: We are going to run a pre-tape show, though.

18:31.430 --> 18:33.131
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be partying next week.

18:33.191 --> 18:36.914
[SPEAKER_07]: So there will be a new episode of Orange Launch Radio, but it will be kind of different.

18:36.974 --> 18:41.838
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be kind of the way for us to kind of close the chapter on this.

18:42.018 --> 18:47.462
[SPEAKER_07]: Because really what's happening is that we're kind of, as I said, the theme is we are starting over.

18:48.632 --> 18:49.113
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

19:07.991 --> 19:10.893
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Radio, What Gamers Really Want to Know

19:29.153 --> 19:32.956
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of work and a lot of going to the gym and a lot of school.

19:33.617 --> 19:35.619
[SPEAKER_15]: I finished my retarded color wheel.

19:35.819 --> 19:37.420
[SPEAKER_15]: Pictures of it abound on the internet.

19:40.783 --> 19:42.505
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just really been a whole bunch of nothing.

19:42.705 --> 19:45.267
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't get to play any Silent Hill, which I'm kind of disappointed about.

19:45.307 --> 19:52.613
[SPEAKER_15]: Although I did play Lego Star Wars on Xbox, which was actually pretty funny.

19:53.034 --> 19:56.817
[SPEAKER_15]: And you can play as General Grievous from the next movie.

19:57.833 --> 19:59.274
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it worth the buy just to laugh at?

20:00.515 --> 20:02.516
[SPEAKER_15]: It's entertaining but kind of frustrating.

20:02.796 --> 20:05.138
[SPEAKER_15]: I would recommend it to kids except there's a couple of hard levels.

20:06.019 --> 20:09.821
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's still kind of funny seeing a Lego mace.

20:10.342 --> 20:16.566
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reason I wanted to interrupt and ask is because my friend actually bought me Lego racers on the old 64 and that was pretty funny.

20:17.987 --> 20:19.048
[SPEAKER_15]: This one's just funny.

20:21.029 --> 20:26.353
[SPEAKER_15]: But yesterday I hung out with Julie all day shopping.

20:27.481 --> 20:29.242
[SPEAKER_15]: Ooh, Trader Joe's.

20:29.262 --> 20:30.563
[SPEAKER_07]: Girls going shopping.

20:30.603 --> 20:31.164
[SPEAKER_07]: Who would have thought?

20:31.184 --> 20:31.604
[SPEAKER_15]: For groceries.

20:32.124 --> 20:32.885
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, hey.

20:35.607 --> 20:36.808
[SPEAKER_07]: Girls going shopping!

20:39.530 --> 20:41.111
[SPEAKER_15]: We did make fun of Paris Hilton a lot.

20:42.252 --> 20:42.732
[SPEAKER_07]: That's hot.

20:46.495 --> 20:56.302
[SPEAKER_15]: And I thought, there was this girl who, we were at the J Street Mall today, and there was this girl who was absolutely slutted up, wearing one of those little skirts that look like, you know, a lampshade cover.

20:57.370 --> 20:58.751
[SPEAKER_15]: and this halter thing.

20:59.051 --> 21:02.813
[SPEAKER_15]: And I wanted to stop her and ask her, say, I'm doing interviews of prostitutes.

21:02.853 --> 21:04.033
[SPEAKER_15]: What's it like living on the streets?

21:08.936 --> 21:10.096
[SPEAKER_15]: But I didn't feel too bitchy.

21:11.217 --> 21:11.977
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a first.

21:12.057 --> 21:13.658
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I had lunch at Hard Rock Cafe.

21:13.678 --> 21:14.698
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

21:15.339 --> 21:16.739
[SPEAKER_15]: Do they have the Guinness burger?

21:17.980 --> 21:19.040
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a Guinness burger?

21:19.060 --> 21:20.261
[SPEAKER_15]: The buns are made with Guinness.

21:20.941 --> 21:21.602
[SPEAKER_15]: It's awesome.

21:23.082 --> 21:24.503
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, carbs, yay.

21:24.763 --> 21:25.844
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to eat me this bun.

21:28.171 --> 21:30.232
[SPEAKER_15]: The buns are made with Guinness.

21:30.632 --> 21:30.932
Wow.

21:32.633 --> 21:34.154
[SPEAKER_15]: And, oh, Thursday.

21:34.674 --> 21:38.115
[SPEAKER_15]: Because there was no karaoke because someone decided to go to something.

21:38.795 --> 21:39.055
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

21:41.036 --> 21:43.197
[SPEAKER_15]: I went to Streets of London and had fish and chips and Guinness.

21:43.357 --> 21:43.897
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's fun.

21:44.197 --> 21:44.818
[SPEAKER_15]: That made me happy.

21:44.838 --> 21:46.298
[SPEAKER_15]: And they had real football on TV.

21:46.458 --> 21:46.999
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

21:47.159 --> 21:50.920
[SPEAKER_07]: Streets of London is like... I'm sure every big town has something like this.

21:51.300 --> 21:53.801
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a British import pub, basically.

21:53.821 --> 21:54.482
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a pub.

21:54.702 --> 21:55.482
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they basically...

21:56.162 --> 22:02.367
[SPEAKER_07]: They've kind of taken it on a giant crane and craned it over here to the United States and set it down in major cities.

22:02.788 --> 22:06.811
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can actually order cheaps the way they should be, the potatoes, you know.

22:07.171 --> 22:09.813
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you get to watch rugby and real football.

22:10.133 --> 22:12.375
[SPEAKER_15]: Real football because American football is crap.

22:13.456 --> 22:13.896
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

22:14.037 --> 22:16.699
[SPEAKER_15]: Rugby is what you need to be watching because those men get bloody.

22:18.360 --> 22:20.722
[SPEAKER_15]: They have padding on their head and that's about it.

22:21.892 --> 22:25.935
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, because they have to, you know, have, you know, brain function, not like, what's-her-face.

22:27.056 --> 22:35.062
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, um, I went to the Crocker Museum today, just to look at stuff, because I had to do it for my art class.

22:35.482 --> 22:36.663
[SPEAKER_15]: There's some pretty cool stuff.

22:36.683 --> 22:39.105
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, what is, what is the Crocker Museum, for those not in the area?

22:39.165 --> 22:42.828
[SPEAKER_15]: It's an art museum, downtown SAC, in this really old house.

22:43.368 --> 22:47.811
[SPEAKER_15]: It made me think of a lot of the old houses in downtown Mobile, so it's sort of like, whoa, this is cool.

22:48.272 --> 22:50.253
[SPEAKER_15]: It's kind of a Victorian-style house, kind of.

22:51.134 --> 22:51.274
[SPEAKER_15]: Like,

22:52.602 --> 22:53.662
[SPEAKER_15]: The house itself was awesome.

22:53.682 --> 23:02.508
[SPEAKER_15]: They had a gallery for this Japanese artist there who did a lot of the representations of the old Kabuki actors.

23:02.728 --> 23:03.088
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

23:03.128 --> 23:03.568
[SPEAKER_15]: It's pretty cool.

23:04.769 --> 23:07.030
[SPEAKER_15]: And then did things on the Genji story.

23:07.551 --> 23:08.171
[SPEAKER_15]: It was pretty cool.

23:09.312 --> 23:13.715
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I went to this one exhibit, though.

23:14.155 --> 23:17.477
[SPEAKER_15]: I swear the sculptures in that were like right out of Silent Hill.

23:20.242 --> 23:21.643
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, this is pretty awesome.

23:23.343 --> 23:29.465
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I had to pick a picture that I really, really liked, and then I had to pick something that I hated and say why I hated it.

23:29.905 --> 23:35.427
[SPEAKER_15]: And the one I picked that I hated was called, like, Angels a la Mode or something.

23:36.728 --> 23:41.469
[SPEAKER_15]: It was this ceramic, shiny lady with this big poofy hair and little angels hanging all over her.

23:41.870 --> 23:42.870
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, this is ugly.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.351
[SPEAKER_16]: That is a really odd comment to come back in.

23:46.431 --> 23:48.512
[SPEAKER_16]: I just start hearing about a ceramic lady with angels.

23:50.256 --> 23:51.137
[SPEAKER_15]: I went to the museum today.

23:55.519 --> 24:01.222
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the picture that I really liked, when you walk into the gallery, it's humongous, it takes up almost this whole piece of wall.

24:02.143 --> 24:10.927
[SPEAKER_15]: It's this old man who sort of looks like Patrick Stewart, sort of, but really, you know, shaggy beard, shaggy hair, laying down like he's dying.

24:11.548 --> 24:13.689
[SPEAKER_15]: But he looks really aware of himself.

24:14.489 --> 24:16.971
[SPEAKER_15]: But as you approach the picture... Sounds kind of erotic.

24:18.427 --> 24:21.008
[SPEAKER_15]: There's these pastel figures all scattered about it.

24:21.329 --> 24:31.134
[SPEAKER_15]: And for a moment I thought that this might be, it's called a glique, which is a giclee, that's what it's called, which is a digital... Wasn't that a movie with Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez?

24:31.254 --> 24:31.534
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

24:31.554 --> 24:31.994
[SPEAKER_07]: A giclee?

24:34.636 --> 24:35.636
[SPEAKER_06]: Just teasing.

24:36.757 --> 24:40.399
[SPEAKER_15]: But what that is is a digital image that's transferred to canvas.

24:41.659 --> 24:46.342
[SPEAKER_15]: And this was actually all done in acrylics on canvas, on this massive canvas.

24:46.667 --> 24:47.207
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

25:17.406 --> 25:18.486
[SPEAKER_07]: Your laundry's going crazy.

25:18.666 --> 25:20.507
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I better go rescue my laundry from your machine.

25:20.527 --> 25:22.788
[SPEAKER_16]: What I was going to say is the washer walking off.

25:23.608 --> 25:24.989
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like, that's it, I quit.

25:27.150 --> 25:27.730
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess so.

25:27.830 --> 25:28.690
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what happened there.

25:29.170 --> 25:29.450
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

25:30.571 --> 25:31.431
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, that's a first.

25:31.551 --> 25:33.732
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, anyway, moving on with how was your week, how was your day.

25:33.832 --> 25:41.535
[SPEAKER_07]: So hopefully if DarkSakura can get some pictures of her artistic day, she can post those up on the forums and you guys can check that out.

25:42.150 --> 25:44.792
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, moving on with how was your week, how was your day?

25:44.813 --> 25:47.235
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's just go Shark Scroll, you got a mic next to you, why not?

25:47.375 --> 25:47.695
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up?

25:48.976 --> 25:53.981
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, obviously my day involved coming here, just for the heck of it.

25:54.021 --> 25:57.784
[SPEAKER_16]: I was like, yesterday I'm like, it's the last episode of Orange Lounge in that studio.

25:58.125 --> 25:58.645
[SPEAKER_16]: You wanna go?

25:58.665 --> 26:01.408
[SPEAKER_16]: And that was that.

26:01.488 --> 26:02.669
[SPEAKER_16]: Very cool.

26:03.209 --> 26:05.912
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I got a new job, new job is

26:06.457 --> 26:07.297
[SPEAKER_16]: Really quite nice.

26:07.517 --> 26:10.518
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a temp for a few months, so I get paid weekly, which is nifty.

26:11.218 --> 26:16.319
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's nice to work at a place where you don't feel like everyone's going to backstab you at any given second.

26:16.719 --> 26:18.719
[SPEAKER_16]: And you actually enjoy working with your coworkers.

26:18.819 --> 26:20.600
[SPEAKER_16]: So I've been very mellow lately.

26:20.620 --> 26:21.740
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's a good thing.

26:21.760 --> 26:22.120
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.

26:22.200 --> 26:22.540
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.

26:22.900 --> 26:24.720
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, so I'm kind of boring, but that's okay.

26:24.960 --> 26:25.401
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's all right.

26:25.901 --> 26:26.621
[SPEAKER_04]: New jobs are fun.

26:27.361 --> 26:28.861
[SPEAKER_16]: And new jobs with lots of money are fun, too.

26:29.261 --> 26:29.861
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, they are.

26:30.201 --> 26:30.361
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

26:31.282 --> 26:31.682
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else?

26:32.322 --> 26:32.362
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

26:32.402 --> 26:33.182
[SPEAKER_04]: Any gaming stuff?

26:33.740 --> 26:39.263
[SPEAKER_16]: I've just been playing, like, Luminez, and I alternate between Luminez on the PSP and Zookeeper on DS.

26:41.504 --> 26:44.505
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, you and Loki outside, was he showing you how to hack your PSP?

26:44.545 --> 26:48.047
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that what he was doing outside, trying to hack into the neighbor's wireless internet?

26:48.267 --> 26:48.807
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, he did!

26:52.009 --> 26:54.070
[SPEAKER_16]: It was not only tried, it was succeeded.

26:54.450 --> 26:56.191
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have Wipeout on your PSP?

26:56.291 --> 26:57.171
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I have Wipeout.

26:57.191 --> 26:59.492
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't have it with me, but I have Wipeout, so I was finding out how to do it.

26:59.633 --> 27:00.113
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

27:00.373 --> 27:01.974
[SPEAKER_07]: So learning from the best, I guess.

27:02.014 --> 27:02.554
[SPEAKER_16]: That's right.

27:03.154 --> 27:06.856
[SPEAKER_07]: So now you can drive around the neighborhood and see what wireless internet you can hack into.

27:06.896 --> 27:11.958
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I have wireless at my house, so if I'm feeling lazy and just don't want to get on my laptop, you know, there you go.

27:12.318 --> 27:12.699
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

27:13.239 --> 27:13.639
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

27:14.539 --> 27:16.040
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, moving on.

27:16.080 --> 27:19.062
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, Mr. Mel B, how was your week?

27:19.082 --> 27:19.442
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your day?

27:20.562 --> 27:21.583
[SPEAKER_27]: Week was pretty interesting.

27:21.603 --> 27:32.188
[SPEAKER_27]: I actually started a new job myself on Monday, working as an editor at this one place that actually does a lot of assessment and standards for kids, so like grades 5 through 11, I'd be

27:33.607 --> 27:39.410
[SPEAKER_27]: Basically editing and proofing a bunch of assessment tests, something like CTBS, SAT type stuff.

27:39.970 --> 27:44.692
[SPEAKER_27]: So it's kind of a cool job to get paid a good amount of money to tell people they're wrong.

27:48.334 --> 27:51.355
[SPEAKER_07]: Did Jamie just yell for a job application from the back?

27:51.395 --> 27:54.236
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

27:57.458 --> 27:59.699
[SPEAKER_07]: For those who didn't hear that, Jamie said, I'll do that for free.

28:01.048 --> 28:12.198
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, it's good times, aside from the commute, being in, like, San Francisco, and I'm in, like, Redwood City, it's about, like, half hour and plus parking, and the city ain't always that great, but it's all good, but, uh, get a nice view.

28:12.618 --> 28:21.285
[SPEAKER_27]: Everything is pretty cool, I mean, it's, like, one of the most kickback jobs, like, it's eight hours, but I get my stuff done by one o'clock, and then I try to go to my boss's office to find something, you know, like, what to do.

28:21.666 --> 28:25.209
[SPEAKER_27]: She's stuck in meetings till, like, four o'clock, so I got three hours of dead time.

28:25.768 --> 28:29.570
[SPEAKER_27]: So, you know, it's all good, and I get to listen to Orange Lounge all day, so hey.

28:29.770 --> 28:30.430
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright!

28:30.790 --> 28:31.131
[SPEAKER_27]: You know?

28:31.151 --> 28:31.551
[SPEAKER_09]: Like that.

28:32.131 --> 28:33.512
[SPEAKER_27]: So, I'm feeling that.

28:34.912 --> 28:35.973
[SPEAKER_27]: Other crazy stuff.

28:37.134 --> 28:42.876
[SPEAKER_27]: Actually, it was funny, it was something mentioned on, I guess it was, yeah, DDR Freak a couple weeks ago.

28:43.236 --> 28:48.119
[SPEAKER_27]: Someone had put up, like, an unofficial, like, top 50 freestyle routines of all time in, like, North America.

28:48.739 --> 28:50.060
[SPEAKER_27]: And me and my boys, like...

28:50.987 --> 28:56.288
[SPEAKER_27]: We started coming up with this idea, like, maybe we should get a couple people, like, all together, get some ideas around it.

28:56.308 --> 29:05.931
[SPEAKER_27]: We actually wanted to put up a list of, like, top 100, you know, freestyles of, like, North American history, like, coming from a freestyler's perspective, coming from, like, someone who's just an avid fan.

29:06.031 --> 29:09.492
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's something that we're going to do, like, probably in a month or two.

29:10.112 --> 29:10.792
[SPEAKER_03]: I got it right now.

29:10.812 --> 29:17.994
[SPEAKER_03]: The first annual DDR freestyle history, I don't know, they can do some sort of, like, award show for that.

29:18.598 --> 29:20.780
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, have best improv routine.

29:21.140 --> 29:24.763
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, just do I Love the Freestyle and get House Sparks.

29:24.963 --> 29:25.484
[SPEAKER_03]: No, thank you.

29:25.524 --> 29:26.404
[SPEAKER_07]: That was my idea.

29:26.444 --> 29:28.566
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get House Sparks to comment on everything.

29:28.626 --> 29:30.668
[SPEAKER_36]: I mean, yeah, we can start it off in like 1999.

29:30.728 --> 29:37.534
[SPEAKER_36]: And then we can go through every year who the big names were in 2000, 2001, all the way until now.

29:37.894 --> 29:40.456
[SPEAKER_27]: Like, yo, 2001, hand slaps and knee drops.

29:40.576 --> 29:42.257
[SPEAKER_27]: Yo, that was ill, man.

29:42.297 --> 29:43.559
[SPEAKER_27]: That was the greatest.

29:43.859 --> 29:44.900
[SPEAKER_15]: Post-18 videos.

29:47.998 --> 29:52.421
[SPEAKER_36]: You know, I was actually considering walking around with my Turnaroshi trophy, like Owen Hart.

29:55.542 --> 29:57.604
[SPEAKER_23]: That's right, I totally forgot you had one.

29:57.624 --> 29:58.564
[SPEAKER_27]: Wow.

29:58.604 --> 30:04.888
[SPEAKER_27]: But it's just some stuff like that, and we actually want to do something with Spot sometime when we can actually get, like, our database back in order.

30:04.908 --> 30:06.749
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, Spot is going to be working again.

30:07.209 --> 30:12.212
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, right now, the thing is, like, our webmaster, you know, got our hands on our back end is in China right now, so...

30:15.134 --> 30:17.757
[SPEAKER_07]: That sucks when your website goes to China.

30:18.538 --> 30:20.100
[SPEAKER_07]: That's no fun at all.

30:22.542 --> 30:23.603
[SPEAKER_27]: But you know, we want to do something like that.

30:23.623 --> 30:25.846
[SPEAKER_27]: We actually want to get videos back up and all that kind of stuff.

30:25.906 --> 30:30.111
[SPEAKER_27]: It's like, because a lot of people, they've only seen stuff maybe 2002, 2005, you know.

30:30.151 --> 30:33.054
[SPEAKER_27]: It'd just be something because there's really nothing better to do.

30:33.683 --> 30:39.725
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean... Since there's no new arcade mixes or anything, we'll just reminisce about old arcade mixes.

30:40.305 --> 30:44.166
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, the longer we live, the more we remember DDR used to be good.

30:46.667 --> 30:53.649
[SPEAKER_27]: But speaking of that, I actually also posted up an article... If this is about what I think it is, I want to talk about this in more detail later.

30:53.969 --> 30:56.330
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, yeah, well... Don't blow it just yet.

30:56.350 --> 30:59.971
[SPEAKER_27]: As a teaser, there was something that I posted up that will probably be talked about later.

31:00.231 --> 31:01.612
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, definitely.

31:03.264 --> 31:05.687
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, we have three hours to fill, don't blow it all now.

31:09.370 --> 31:22.343
[SPEAKER_27]: See, other than that, just been kicking back for now, waiting for my E3 guest passes to come in next week, and all of a sudden I'm realizing there's a lot of friends I never knew I had, you know?

31:24.265 --> 31:27.528
[SPEAKER_27]: You know how that goes, it's like, I don't know, the way I see it, it's

31:28.106 --> 31:33.428
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, people usually offer, you know, if you get me into E3, I'll get you, you know, this, this, and this.

31:33.448 --> 31:35.929
[SPEAKER_27]: Man, what I gotta do is just get this stuff on eBay.

31:35.969 --> 31:39.310
[SPEAKER_27]: Like, I got Dutch Auction 10, you know, passes right here.

31:39.410 --> 31:40.051
[SPEAKER_27]: Everyone bids.

31:40.071 --> 31:41.471
[SPEAKER_27]: You're like, I'll get you dinner.

31:41.611 --> 31:42.772
[SPEAKER_27]: Reserve not yet met.

31:45.272 --> 31:51.675
[SPEAKER_27]: So, you know, it's just interesting to see how everyone becomes all chummy like a month before it happens.

31:51.755 --> 31:52.775
[SPEAKER_27]: But, you know, it's all good.

31:53.175 --> 31:54.416
[SPEAKER_27]: It's the price of fame, you know.

31:54.966 --> 31:59.410
[SPEAKER_16]: It'll be even more interesting to see how chummy people get with me when they see I have a media pass and can get fun goodies.

32:01.852 --> 32:04.394
[SPEAKER_27]: But, you know, that's pretty much the week in general.

32:04.434 --> 32:05.675
[SPEAKER_27]: Everything's been pretty cool.

32:06.496 --> 32:12.081
[SPEAKER_27]: As far as gaming, when I get a chance, I steal Luminous from Shark's Girl.

32:12.101 --> 32:17.246
[SPEAKER_27]: Other than that, I've just been like, I pretty much kill time playing San Andreas for the hell of it.

32:17.886 --> 32:20.589
[SPEAKER_27]: Because there's like so many, because I already beat the game like once.

32:20.629 --> 32:21.389
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm just trying to go for 100%.

32:23.072 --> 32:27.413
[SPEAKER_27]: So it's good times and that's basically the week in a nutshell.

32:28.273 --> 32:28.633
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

32:29.814 --> 32:33.775
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Islander, how was your week?

32:33.835 --> 32:34.815
[SPEAKER_36]: How was your day?

32:34.875 --> 32:35.535
[SPEAKER_36]: Week's been alright.

32:36.735 --> 32:37.195
[SPEAKER_36]: Let's see.

32:37.696 --> 32:39.416
[SPEAKER_36]: Work is pretty much there.

32:40.136 --> 32:44.797
[SPEAKER_36]: The only thing that I've been playing all week was actually Leisure Suit Larry Magna Cum Laude.

32:47.838 --> 32:48.838
[SPEAKER_07]: Any particular reason why?

32:49.839 --> 32:51.399
[SPEAKER_36]: I wanted it and it was on sale for like

32:52.649 --> 32:52.909
[SPEAKER_36]: 30 bucks.

32:53.430 --> 32:54.210
[SPEAKER_36]: So I was like, alright, cool.

32:54.370 --> 32:54.851
[SPEAKER_36]: I'll pick that up.

32:55.451 --> 32:59.934
[SPEAKER_36]: Finished it in like, I don't know, maybe seven hours.

33:02.496 --> 33:06.058
[SPEAKER_36]: And aside from that, not really a whole lot of too much.

33:07.419 --> 33:10.181
[SPEAKER_36]: I actually went and played P.I.U.

33:10.201 --> 33:12.562
[SPEAKER_36]: today for the first time in like ages.

33:12.802 --> 33:14.744
[SPEAKER_07]: And to the non-hipsters, that's Pump It Up.

33:15.484 --> 33:16.385
[SPEAKER_07]: P.I.U., Pump It Up.

33:19.687 --> 33:21.328
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes, and I actually did play that song, actually.

33:22.614 --> 33:29.035
[SPEAKER_36]: But yeah, it was just pretty interesting just to go to a place that had video games and you put a dollar in the machine and it actually gave out quarters.

33:30.376 --> 33:31.016
[SPEAKER_36]: It's like, wow.

33:31.036 --> 33:32.676
[SPEAKER_36]: It's like I had to use it somewhere else.

33:35.357 --> 33:37.377
[SPEAKER_07]: I can get laundry money from a pump-it-up machine?

33:37.937 --> 33:38.457
[SPEAKER_36]: Yeah, really.

33:38.477 --> 33:39.437
[SPEAKER_36]: It was hot.

33:39.537 --> 33:40.498
[SPEAKER_36]: You have no idea.

33:41.718 --> 33:42.938
[SPEAKER_36]: But no, let's see.

33:43.318 --> 33:45.239
[SPEAKER_36]: Oh, I went to Denio's, walked around for a bit.

33:45.779 --> 33:47.659
[SPEAKER_36]: I found the greatest Eddie Guerrero shirts.

33:48.979 --> 33:49.799
[SPEAKER_36]: It was hell.

33:49.919 --> 33:50.860
[SPEAKER_36]: It was all hell.

33:51.020 --> 33:51.260
[SPEAKER_36]: It sucked.

33:51.580 --> 33:54.961
[SPEAKER_27]: This entire week sucked.

34:11.398 --> 34:15.441
[SPEAKER_03]: I started off with, I got, okay, first I started my new job, game sales.

34:15.761 --> 34:17.763
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all good, you know, starting to train and stuff.

34:18.984 --> 34:20.285
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's just grueling.

34:20.305 --> 34:28.931
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just very, they're having me, I'm fighting with this stupid person in Dallas because they think they know everything about, you know, certain games that are coming out.

34:29.111 --> 34:31.012
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been doing this for 18 years!

34:31.072 --> 34:37.497
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, first she, I'm like, she gives me this thing that says, you know, our new releases are coming up in May.

34:37.597 --> 34:39.939
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first thing that's on there is Ape Escape for the PSP.

34:40.839 --> 34:43.980
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I think the state's wrong because it's in stores right now.

34:44.300 --> 34:45.200
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one of the launch titles.

34:45.700 --> 34:47.020
[SPEAKER_16]: No, it got pushed back to me.

34:47.461 --> 34:48.181
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's in the stores.

34:48.261 --> 34:54.162
[SPEAKER_03]: I picked it up with my hand, thought about buying it, saw it sucked, and then put it back down.

34:54.942 --> 35:00.004
[SPEAKER_03]: And then she's like, there's this other title on there that was, what was it?

35:00.764 --> 35:03.644
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey Arnold, the movie, the game for the GBA.

35:03.884 --> 35:05.145
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, hold on, hold on.

35:05.965 --> 35:09.226
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey Arnold, the movie, the game.

35:09.906 --> 35:10.446
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

35:11.667 --> 35:19.009
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and that game came out three years ago, when the movie came out, and she still insists it's a new release.

35:19.049 --> 35:23.150
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, okay, so that's when I had to get my boss involved.

35:23.471 --> 35:30.513
[SPEAKER_03]: He saw the emails go back and forth, and he joked with me, because he actually has a, he's understanding, so he's like, so you're trying to piss off, you know, the neighbor?

35:31.633 --> 35:33.053
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck is that kid doing right there?

35:33.794 --> 35:34.874
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, giant paper airplane.

35:37.148 --> 35:38.768
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking kids, stop distracting me!

35:39.249 --> 35:48.211
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, you're trying to piss off the Dallas people, but anyways, I'm trying to piss off the neighbor throwing the giant paper airplane.

35:50.672 --> 35:51.712
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell is wrong?

35:52.532 --> 35:55.173
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of inbred people do we have living around here, I swear?

35:55.777 --> 35:58.418
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyways, back to... I don't think we were in Mississippi.

35:59.058 --> 36:00.219
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to the story, okay.

36:00.799 --> 36:02.219
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, this has been going on all week.

36:02.279 --> 36:10.783
[SPEAKER_03]: What's kind of cool, though, is they're actually kind of serious about the game side of everything, so they're going to convert our conference room into a game room with a giant plasma screen TV, so that's kind of cool.

36:12.532 --> 36:13.433
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've been doing that.

36:13.753 --> 36:17.937
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this week, this weekend, I got to move!

36:18.517 --> 36:19.338
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

36:19.438 --> 36:21.340
[SPEAKER_03]: So this entire week was packing.

36:21.920 --> 36:24.683
[SPEAKER_03]: And then today and yesterday was moving.

36:25.223 --> 36:26.444
[SPEAKER_03]: And that sucked.

36:27.065 --> 36:28.826
[SPEAKER_03]: And I still have tons more left.

36:29.126 --> 36:31.388
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just put it this way.

36:31.789 --> 36:34.791
[SPEAKER_03]: That arcade cabinet, I think, was never meant to move at all.

36:35.152 --> 36:36.893
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, I tried moving it today.

36:36.993 --> 36:40.116
[SPEAKER_03]: First thing that happened, the wheels pushed through the bottom on the front.

36:40.540 --> 36:43.002
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, ah shit, that sucks, now it won't roll.

36:43.382 --> 36:50.988
[SPEAKER_03]: So then we sat here, leaned the cabinet back on its back wheels for a while, and I tried to reinforce the bottom with screws.

36:51.388 --> 36:54.230
[SPEAKER_03]: Set it back down, got it to the door, and it busted through the bottom again.

36:54.250 --> 36:55.391
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, ah, fuck this.

36:55.892 --> 36:57.373
[SPEAKER_03]: So we finally got everything going.

36:58.514 --> 37:01.096
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, these kids are old school paper airplanes.

37:01.636 --> 37:02.297
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear to God.

37:02.657 --> 37:03.237
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so we...

37:05.834 --> 37:07.275
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

37:07.375 --> 37:12.359
[SPEAKER_07]: When it comes down, when the battle is said and done, DS versus PSP, the winner, paper airplanes.

37:14.561 --> 37:15.121
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

37:17.163 --> 37:17.603
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God.

37:17.643 --> 37:25.309
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so finally, we got the cabinet to the house, and we had to wheel it around and finally got it in there.

37:25.349 --> 37:28.051
[SPEAKER_03]: We had to dodge this light that was by my door, and

37:28.889 --> 37:33.551
[SPEAKER_03]: The Fire Extinguisher in its glass case, you know, I had to dodge all that stuff.

37:34.532 --> 37:35.352
[SPEAKER_03]: Barely fit through.

37:35.372 --> 37:37.013
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you should have seen the couch yesterday.

37:37.033 --> 37:44.096
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, see, the way our apartment is set up, you've kind of got the two apartments right there and there's like a walkway that goes in front of both of them.

37:44.356 --> 37:49.218
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the apartment next to me has the sidewalk that's actually coming, you know, away from the apartment.

37:49.919 --> 37:55.801
[SPEAKER_03]: And for me, all I've got is this hole between the bush that's just about enough, you know, wide enough to fit the couch.

37:56.422 --> 37:56.722
[SPEAKER_03]: Just barely.

37:56.742 --> 37:56.942
[SPEAKER_03]: Barely.

37:58.186 --> 37:59.907
[SPEAKER_03]: The fuck is my phone ringing for?

38:00.607 --> 38:01.327
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn it.

38:02.447 --> 38:02.807
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

38:06.829 --> 38:07.129
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello?

38:08.349 --> 38:09.830
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you forget you were trying to do a show?

38:12.311 --> 38:14.931
[SPEAKER_16]: This is why cell phones need to be turned off during the show.

38:15.712 --> 38:18.032
[SPEAKER_16]: Should we start playing the Jeopardy theme or something?

38:19.593 --> 38:20.933
[SPEAKER_07]: No, start making orgasm noises.

38:21.774 --> 38:23.674
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, what that was, that was Nelly.

38:24.494 --> 38:25.895
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get into this too, okay?

38:26.616 --> 38:38.560
[SPEAKER_03]: She was asking if I needed pants, because... Because you see... Because you see, yesterday, while moving... Hold on, hold on.

38:38.740 --> 38:40.180
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me just... Okay, let me think about this.

38:41.241 --> 38:48.243
[SPEAKER_06]: Mellie knows that you do a radio show on the internet that is nominated for Broadcaster of the Year.

38:49.383 --> 38:49.743
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay?

38:50.164 --> 38:53.265
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are one of five stations nominated Broadcaster of the Year.

38:53.385 --> 38:54.325
[SPEAKER_06]: So she understands...

38:55.149 --> 38:58.192
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of commitment you put in Sunday nights.

38:58.793 --> 39:03.837
[SPEAKER_06]: She calls you, interrupts the show to ask you if you have pants.

39:04.678 --> 39:06.160
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, I'm getting to that.

39:06.280 --> 39:07.020
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, gosh.

39:07.180 --> 39:09.182
[SPEAKER_03]: I was the one that asked her, okay?

39:09.463 --> 39:14.007
[SPEAKER_03]: She was nice enough to go, to offer to get me pants at Walmart because the, you know.

39:14.946 --> 39:15.787
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

39:31.428 --> 39:41.535
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, I had busted pants, you know, I have one pair of pants left that I'm not really sure if I have, so just to be on the safe side, I got a backup pair of pants just to make sure.

39:41.855 --> 39:42.916
[SPEAKER_10]: No!

39:43.537 --> 39:45.838
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you having problems with your ass?

39:47.259 --> 39:58.107
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyways, that is why she called, because she wanted me to, I was supposed to check to see if I had the pants in the dryer, and I didn't quite get to do that before the show, so...

39:58.968 --> 39:59.588
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

40:18.246 --> 40:24.790
[SPEAKER_03]: So then I had to go next door and drop the car off so, you know, I could see what's wrong because the check engine light's like, SOMETHING'S WRONG!

40:25.050 --> 40:26.130
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm not telling you what.

40:26.531 --> 40:27.311
[SPEAKER_03]: SOMETHING'S WRONG!

40:27.591 --> 40:31.213
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be as little as the gas cap, or it could be your engine's falling apart.

40:31.693 --> 40:34.235
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're not gonna tell you, I'm just gonna turn on the light.

40:35.035 --> 40:39.538
[SPEAKER_03]: And you gotta take it down to the shop so they can laugh at you if it's something stupid, you know.

40:39.918 --> 40:45.821
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I checked the gas, you know, cap three times, all my fluids are fine, so it's nothing I did to the car.

40:46.368 --> 40:47.529
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the car falling apart.

40:47.549 --> 40:48.610
[SPEAKER_15]: Your fluids are fine.

40:48.750 --> 40:50.351
[SPEAKER_07]: Does the car need pants?

40:52.233 --> 40:53.353
[SPEAKER_03]: The car does not need pants.

40:53.934 --> 40:55.755
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, last week... Give me pants!

40:56.556 --> 41:04.322
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, last week... Yes, I've seen... Yeah, that's true.

41:04.462 --> 41:10.426
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so, pants, car, moving stuff aside, it's been an okay week.

41:10.486 --> 41:15.230
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it's one hell of a hectic week, and it's not going to get any better this week, so...

41:15.974 --> 41:16.634
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, oh well.

41:16.955 --> 41:21.036
[SPEAKER_07]: Our chat room, which I haven't plugged yet, www.orangeontrainer.com, click on chat.

41:21.056 --> 41:22.317
[SPEAKER_07]: There's already a ton of people in there.

41:22.357 --> 41:26.199
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need to plug it because it's a party in there already, but hopefully some of you guys will want to join it.

41:27.459 --> 41:31.121
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have the chat room, unfortunately, on the TV studio cam today.

41:31.241 --> 41:33.022
[SPEAKER_07]: Only I and DarkSakura can see it.

41:33.302 --> 41:39.704
[SPEAKER_07]: But we will pass along the messages, such as Firebomber has an explanation for why Loki is ripping all his pants.

41:40.805 --> 41:42.786
[SPEAKER_07]: Firebomber is suggesting you're getting fat, fatty.

41:44.427 --> 41:50.071
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm, okay, I'm not getting fat, it's actually not my ass that's ripping, it's the fucking crotch that's ripped out.

41:50.411 --> 41:52.513
[SPEAKER_07]: My nuts are too big for the pants.

41:52.853 --> 41:56.135
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on, and then it goes on to say, Fatty McTubbs might have to lose some tons.

41:57.637 --> 42:02.840
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I've fucking got tons of exercise this week, lifting the goddamn couch and moving the cabinet and shit.

42:03.141 --> 42:05.903
[SPEAKER_03]: I've lifted enough boxes and done enough exercise this week.

42:06.363 --> 42:10.326
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was sex involved too, so goddammit, I've had my fill of exercise.

42:15.017 --> 42:15.598
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm finished.

42:17.039 --> 42:18.220
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, look, now you've done it.

42:18.280 --> 42:19.301
[SPEAKER_16]: Rob is speechless.

42:20.362 --> 42:21.123
[SPEAKER_07]: Angel, how was your week?

42:21.163 --> 42:21.723
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your day?

42:23.965 --> 42:25.526
[SPEAKER_00]: How the hell am I going to top that?

42:25.647 --> 42:25.927
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait.

42:28.109 --> 42:29.030
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what Nellie asked.

42:36.076 --> 42:38.058
[SPEAKER_15]: Whole new meaning to the term Swellhead.

42:38.818 --> 42:40.200
[SPEAKER_03]: She wasn't complaining this morning.

42:44.895 --> 42:46.716
[SPEAKER_15]: You're listening to KTMI.

42:46.796 --> 42:48.538
[SPEAKER_15]: Too much information all the time.

42:52.441 --> 42:54.602
[SPEAKER_07]: We're experiencing technical difficulties right now.

42:57.144 --> 42:58.105
[SPEAKER_06]: The host is speechless.

42:58.765 --> 43:00.126
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got big balls.

43:00.507 --> 43:01.788
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got big balls.

43:02.088 --> 43:03.389
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's try this again.

43:04.309 --> 43:05.751
[SPEAKER_07]: Angel, how was your week?

43:05.811 --> 43:06.491
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your day?

43:06.891 --> 43:07.172
[SPEAKER_07]: Pants.

43:10.914 --> 43:11.595
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, um...

43:12.634 --> 43:20.856
[SPEAKER_15]: Just, uh, working on school stuff, and, uh, work, and yada yada, and... Okay, guys!

43:22.717 --> 43:24.817
[SPEAKER_15]: Working on school and pets.

43:27.018 --> 43:29.219
[SPEAKER_15]: My pants are probably fine, thank you very much!

43:33.300 --> 43:40.982
[SPEAKER_16]: It could be a fortune cookie, I don't know, that's up to, uh... Instead of, like, adding in bed to your fortune, you add with pants?

43:43.608 --> 43:44.068
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.

43:46.229 --> 43:46.809
[SPEAKER_15]: That could work.

43:47.049 --> 43:47.389
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.

43:47.969 --> 43:48.609
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no, no.

43:48.629 --> 43:49.530
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make me think about that.

43:51.230 --> 43:52.070
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.

43:52.590 --> 43:55.671
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, um, I actually found time to play Final Fantasy XI this week.

43:56.251 --> 43:56.671
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.

43:57.952 --> 43:58.392
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.

43:58.452 --> 44:00.692
[SPEAKER_00]: Not if I just picked it up this week.

44:01.352 --> 44:02.193
[SPEAKER_00]: All the time, anyway.

44:04.113 --> 44:07.354
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, okay.

44:07.374 --> 44:07.974
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.

44:08.214 --> 44:08.614
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm done.

44:09.214 --> 44:11.975
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, for the record, getting MPK just kind of

44:13.078 --> 44:14.960
[SPEAKER_00]: Wrong and interesting at the same time.

44:16.481 --> 44:21.986
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm going to let Rob maybe fill in that blank because I'm not going to sit there and explain it again.

44:23.167 --> 44:24.488
[SPEAKER_07]: MPK and Final Fantasy XI.

44:24.528 --> 44:27.290
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, she got scary monsters trained on top of her.

44:27.610 --> 44:28.811
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's no fun at all.

44:29.832 --> 44:32.675
[SPEAKER_07]: You should call GM on that guy.

44:32.915 --> 44:33.175
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

44:34.116 --> 44:35.937
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, right.

44:36.138 --> 44:36.498
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

44:37.246 --> 44:39.267
[SPEAKER_07]: My week and my day was pretty cool.

44:39.347 --> 44:42.449
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't top the pants thing, though, honestly, so I don't really know what I can say.

44:43.010 --> 44:44.370
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't top pants.

44:45.891 --> 44:53.115
[SPEAKER_07]: I did see Margaret Cho on Thursday, which was pretty cool, except it was a lot of recycled stuff from the last tour, which was kind of sad.

44:54.756 --> 44:55.757
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, did you find pants?

44:56.377 --> 44:57.538
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki found pants, everybody.

44:58.378 --> 45:01.180
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, what else is going on?

45:01.360 --> 45:01.740
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I...

45:06.616 --> 45:07.496
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you say that on mic?

45:07.817 --> 45:19.183
[SPEAKER_36]: Okay, now yes, he did find pants, but for the record, he is currently wearing shorts, so it's not like he's completely bottomless here.

45:21.024 --> 45:23.185
[SPEAKER_07]: Something to note here.

45:24.686 --> 45:27.627
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I've also kind of been moving a little bit as well.

45:27.927 --> 45:29.628
[SPEAKER_07]: As I said, you know, got the keys to the new place.

45:29.688 --> 45:32.390
[SPEAKER_07]: My big move stuff comes next Sunday though, so I'm still here.

45:32.430 --> 45:35.091
[SPEAKER_16]: I was going to say, for having move stuff, there sure is a

45:38.492 --> 45:42.374
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not moving until Sunday, but I kind of checked out the new place and that's about it.

45:42.454 --> 45:43.974
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing big.

45:44.795 --> 45:45.215
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

45:46.275 --> 45:46.836
[SPEAKER_07]: That's about it.

45:47.376 --> 45:49.797
[SPEAKER_07]: I really can't top the other stuff going on.

45:51.657 --> 45:53.078
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we weren't here last week.

45:54.098 --> 45:56.119
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody kind of had their own thing going on last weekend.

45:56.159 --> 45:59.540
[SPEAKER_07]: I went and saw Garbage, the band, in San Francisco, so that was cool.

46:01.521 --> 46:02.362
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not garbage.

46:02.462 --> 46:03.282
[SPEAKER_07]: They're actually pretty good.

46:04.520 --> 46:06.841
[SPEAKER_16]: Blah to you, I say, but I can top you.

46:06.942 --> 46:09.103
[SPEAKER_16]: I got to see Garbage and it was open for Alanis Morissette.

46:09.303 --> 46:10.384
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate you.

46:11.224 --> 46:13.205
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, all right, let's go to a break.

46:13.225 --> 46:14.306
[SPEAKER_07]: We definitely need a break here.

46:14.386 --> 46:18.649
[SPEAKER_07]: When we come back, more antics here on Orange Launch Radio, including some Bomani news.

46:18.669 --> 46:21.090
[SPEAKER_07]: There's actually been quite a bit in the past two weeks.

46:21.130 --> 46:23.432
[SPEAKER_07]: So the thing that Mel hinted at earlier, we'll get to.

46:23.932 --> 46:27.354
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, Politary says something relevant.

46:27.654 --> 46:28.275
[SPEAKER_07]: It's amazing.

46:28.775 --> 46:30.576
[SPEAKER_07]: We will get to that in a little bit.

46:30.896 --> 46:31.497
[SPEAKER_07]: In this break...

46:32.771 --> 46:35.411
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to play Bomani songs with three-word titles.

46:36.192 --> 46:37.852
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted an excuse to play Temple of Love.

46:37.872 --> 46:38.692
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be back after this.

46:39.252 --> 46:40.032
[SPEAKER_07]: More Orange Lounge Radio.

47:29.802 --> 47:42.579
[SPEAKER_01]: is all the power, helping you through the midnight hour, the secret of love and peace, soul and heart it will release, so, for your head and pray, it's gonna take you, be awake, flying like a snow dove, out, to the temple of love.

49:46.694 --> 49:48.895
Turn around, look at what you see

50:21.517 --> 50:22.693
All of the phages

51:21.618 --> 51:26.402
[SPEAKER_24]: Follow the sound, follow the sound, leaving the rain behind.

51:27.082 --> 51:32.306
[SPEAKER_22]: Together we'll be in harmony, taking the time we will find out.

52:58.729 --> 53:07.891
[SPEAKER_24]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 139, the last episode of Orange Lounge Radio from our current studio.

53:08.031 --> 53:10.531
[SPEAKER_24]: This DDR sucks pants!

53:24.875 --> 53:26.658
[SPEAKER_05]: Let the joke die.

53:26.918 --> 53:28.260
[SPEAKER_05]: Step away from the joke.

53:28.280 --> 53:34.088
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, if Deathgate could live into Final Fantasy XI this long, I can have pants joy.

53:34.869 --> 53:35.230
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

53:36.147 --> 53:43.391
[SPEAKER_07]: I remembered something during How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day I wanted to talk about that I didn't get a chance to because I got sidetracked by pants.

53:44.972 --> 53:48.454
[SPEAKER_07]: I went to an antique store yesterday with my mom because my mom loves shopping for antiques.

53:49.194 --> 53:49.595
[SPEAKER_07]: Go figure.

53:50.555 --> 53:57.279
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was looking around and I actually saw these antique cactus jars and when I looked at them...

53:57.899 --> 53:59.301
[SPEAKER_07]: I could only think of one thing.

53:59.361 --> 54:00.742
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought of DDR.

54:01.002 --> 54:07.409
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to post this link in the chat room there, so you guys can pull up that picture yourself if you want to look, because I took that picture on my cell phone.

54:07.789 --> 54:12.994
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, when you look at this, does anyone else think Gomlanda Couple right here?

54:14.476 --> 54:17.399
[SPEAKER_07]: This whole set, you want to know how much they wanted for this three-piece set?

54:17.419 --> 54:17.399
$55.

54:17.439 --> 54:18.940
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted it, though.

54:23.350 --> 54:27.912
[SPEAKER_07]: I was thinking about it, just to have that sad little Gumball and the Couple joke.

54:27.932 --> 54:28.693
[SPEAKER_07]: Wouldn't that have been funny?

54:30.034 --> 54:30.314
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

54:33.916 --> 54:34.336
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

54:35.097 --> 54:38.699
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to open up our Skype line in a little bit, but first I want to talk about some DDR news going on right now.

54:39.219 --> 54:44.963
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you know, boys and girls, that there is a brand new DDR game coming out?

54:46.267 --> 54:49.149
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably something you'll never ever ever be able to afford.

54:49.589 --> 54:52.771
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually a DDR fitness game.

54:53.071 --> 54:58.615
[SPEAKER_07]: So Mel, if you don't mind, I'm sorry, you're having a psych conversation there, I'm totally interrupting.

54:59.896 --> 55:02.717
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell us a little more about the DDR fitness project.

55:02.757 --> 55:03.298
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going on here?

55:03.478 --> 55:07.680
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, well just to give a quick background on how it all came about and such.

55:08.361 --> 55:15.105
[SPEAKER_27]: There was a convention about two or three weeks ago called the URSA, which is like the International Health Racquetball Conference.

55:15.435 --> 55:39.689
[SPEAKER_27]: Sports Association, I know there's like an international racquetball association out there but that said they have like an expo every year and it usually showcases a lot of stuff in fitness so there's often a lot of like fitness equipment like treadmills, exercise machines, they have a lot of people like GNC they go out there and they promote their vitamins that kind of stuff so basically the whole thing is a bunch of people running around in spandex that's what the convention is.

55:40.450 --> 55:44.415
[SPEAKER_27]: No, but see, the thing is, you might think that's bad, but you're thinking, you know, from an anime con standpoint.

55:44.575 --> 55:47.279
[SPEAKER_27]: These people work out and take care of themselves.

55:47.599 --> 55:48.761
[SPEAKER_27]: It's not a bad thing.

55:48.961 --> 55:49.922
[SPEAKER_15]: Send in more Manfei.

55:52.005 --> 55:52.446
[SPEAKER_27]: Essentially.

55:52.706 --> 55:54.889
[SPEAKER_27]: But Konami actually had a booth there.

55:55.780 --> 56:00.083
[SPEAKER_27]: And Konami's booth was actually Konami Tokyo's sports division.

56:00.644 --> 56:05.707
[SPEAKER_27]: And they actually do stuff like tread, they actually, Konami does a sports line of equipment.

56:05.727 --> 56:08.489
[SPEAKER_27]: They do treadmills, they do like weight machine stuff.

56:08.549 --> 56:10.350
[SPEAKER_27]: It's actually kind of neat just, you know, shortly.

56:10.731 --> 56:12.172
[SPEAKER_27]: They do stuff that's like computerized.

56:12.192 --> 56:18.116
[SPEAKER_27]: So like if you have a treadmill, you can actually like have a screen in front of you where you can like surf the web, you can like watch satellite TV.

56:18.596 --> 56:30.943
[SPEAKER_27]: There's really neat things that it actually has a computer chip that you wear around your wrist where you can go around like all bunch of different machines in one gym and it'll actually track how many calories you've been burning along the way with all the different machines.

56:31.284 --> 56:32.945
[SPEAKER_07]: Konami does a lot more than people think.

56:32.985 --> 56:35.406
[SPEAKER_07]: Konami is not just about, you know, DDR and Castlevania.

56:35.466 --> 56:36.967
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot more to Konami.

56:36.987 --> 56:45.992
[SPEAKER_07]: They actually, and when I go to the casino, I always see slot machines that were done by Konami and that just trips me out because I always think of Konami as, oh, you know, DDR and Gradius, right?

56:46.373 --> 56:46.493
[SPEAKER_07]: But...

56:47.823 --> 57:16.581
[SPEAKER_27]: Konami does a lot more than people think sometimes so yeah sports is like their big thing over in Japan and well getting more towards relevant stuff I guess they were actually showcasing something called DDR Studio which is basically sort of like what DDR could be in a fitness club type atmosphere obviously there are limitations with a home console whereas like Xbox you can only play up to four people you know well what if like you want to have a whole bunch of people going out there

57:17.113 --> 57:44.866
[SPEAKER_27]: so there's this program that they showed and how it worked was you have like wireless pads and you can play up to like eight players you know on this demo and what it is is you have like one instructor up front kind of like in any other aerobics class they'd be giving you like showing off the routine so there would be a game of DDR going but more so instead of paying attention to the screen and looking at the arrows and you know timing your steps like we all do just because we're

57:45.734 --> 58:13.861
[SPEAKER_27]: like all conditioned for DDR they actually take you through a routine which is almost like for all intents and purposes it's like freestyle only they're teaching it to you along the way and they do all different types of programs with it's really neat they do stuff like stretching programs like there's one that's like yoga tai chi type stuff where you go into like different poses and you hold freezes and such and then they do stuff that's a little more advanced like you do like a Muay Thai kickboxing type thing so in a way it's almost sort of like martial beat only like a lot less weird

58:14.941 --> 58:16.482
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought that was interesting.

58:17.002 --> 58:22.866
[SPEAKER_07]: The story that you posted over on DDR Freak kind of talks about a little, and if people want to see the story, of course, head on over to DDRFreak.com.

58:22.886 --> 58:24.226
[SPEAKER_07]: They have more information there.

58:24.266 --> 58:25.247
[SPEAKER_07]: It's their top story right now.

58:26.548 --> 58:30.810
[SPEAKER_07]: It talks about that there's actually additional symbols, like there's stars and stuff that are used.

58:31.510 --> 58:40.076
[SPEAKER_27]: In addition, the way the graphic interface is set up is you basically have the step gauge in the center of the screen and onto the sides of it.

58:40.457 --> 58:48.743
[SPEAKER_27]: They have players one through eight, one through the odds on one side, the evens on the other, and it tracks how many calories you burn, just like in workout mode in DDR.

58:49.703 --> 58:51.445
[SPEAKER_27]: On top of that, what it does is...

58:52.677 --> 58:58.219
[SPEAKER_27]: The additional symbols you have is a fist that you see coming up, and the fist will either say LOR.

58:58.619 --> 59:03.560
[SPEAKER_27]: So when that comes up to the step gauge, that's your, the step zone, that's your cue to throw a left punch or a right punch.

59:04.040 --> 59:05.761
[SPEAKER_27]: It's variant, of course, obviously by the routine.

59:05.781 --> 59:07.781
[SPEAKER_27]: Sometimes there'll be a jab, sometimes there'll be an uppercut.

59:08.101 --> 59:11.362
[SPEAKER_27]: It's dictated by the actual workout routine itself.

59:11.622 --> 59:16.384
[SPEAKER_27]: And then there's one that's a star that tells you, prompts you to do a kicking type motion.

59:16.684 --> 59:20.125
[SPEAKER_27]: So it could either be like a knee thrust or it could be like a forward lunge kick or a side kick.

59:21.775 --> 59:27.917
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really trying to take this DDR being a fitness thing and taking it one step further, really.

59:28.717 --> 59:29.458
[SPEAKER_03]: Ninjas!

59:29.678 --> 59:31.278
[SPEAKER_03]: They're creating ninjas, people!

59:31.318 --> 59:32.179
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you see?

59:32.759 --> 59:33.199
[SPEAKER_03]: Ninjas!

59:33.459 --> 59:35.140
[SPEAKER_03]: Kicking and punching, what more do we need?

59:35.160 --> 59:35.740
[SPEAKER_03]: They're ninjas!

59:35.760 --> 59:43.182
[SPEAKER_07]: 24-hour ninjas coming soon to a 24-hour fitness near you.

59:44.063 --> 59:46.743
[SPEAKER_27]: Wow, that's like eight times three ninjas to movie, man.

59:49.604 --> 59:50.105
[SPEAKER_27]: Wow, wow.

59:52.289 --> 59:56.732
[SPEAKER_27]: No, but I mean, I guess a lot of people, I mean, that's the basic premise of it.

59:56.992 --> 01:00:08.600
[SPEAKER_27]: The cool thing I noticed about like the hardware is, you know, I said they're using wireless pads, but the pads that you see out there aren't really like the consumer ones you see, which are like kind of, you know, the vinyl over and then that, you know, the foldable soft pads.

01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:11.422
[SPEAKER_27]: They actually use a somewhat semi-hard pad.

01:00:11.742 --> 01:00:16.365
[SPEAKER_27]: What it is, it's sort of like they use a hard rubber, which is kind of like what they use in car floor mats.

01:00:16.905 --> 01:00:19.547
[SPEAKER_27]: So it's pretty rubbery and it's very durable actually.

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:26.765
[SPEAKER_27]: and I don't think they, they said that it wasn't necessarily wireless, it was more like a Bluetooth type infrared type technology that they used.

01:00:27.366 --> 01:00:29.427
[SPEAKER_27]: So, I mean, that was just another tidbit of that.

01:00:30.808 --> 01:00:35.612
[SPEAKER_27]: And they actually work with PS2s, so if there was a way I could ever actually get my hands on that, I'd so be there.

01:00:38.359 --> 01:00:46.505
[SPEAKER_27]: But the thing about, I guess, what a lot of people are commenting is, you know, a lot of people, especially in the just online community, are saying like, great, where's our arcade mix?

01:00:46.786 --> 01:00:47.826
[SPEAKER_27]: Boohoo, no one cares.

01:00:47.866 --> 01:00:49.127
[SPEAKER_27]: You're like, this is fitness.

01:00:49.267 --> 01:00:50.528
[SPEAKER_27]: The last thing we need to see is this.

01:00:50.569 --> 01:01:01.417
[SPEAKER_27]: It's like, the way I see it right now, if Konami's arcade division does not want to go in the route of, you know, Dance Dance Revolution, and obviously they don't want to do something in America, this is their only alternate route.

01:01:01.457 --> 01:01:06.581
[SPEAKER_27]: Because if they keep targeting the same gamers, you know, like on the consumer level,

01:01:07.233 --> 01:01:09.074
[SPEAKER_27]: I do think Loki's got a comment.

01:01:09.114 --> 01:01:12.296
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's hope to God that they have these pads at E3 instead of the crappy soft pads.

01:01:27.012 --> 01:01:27.973
[SPEAKER_27]: All mentioned at the Jason.

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:48.481
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

01:01:59.164 --> 01:02:04.849
[SPEAKER_16]: By bringing it into a gym, it kind of legitimizes it a little bit versus that crazy game that all the gamers play.

01:02:04.889 --> 01:02:09.793
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like, oh, hey, it's something that other people who may not play games for any other reason can go and do.

01:02:10.053 --> 01:02:17.699
[SPEAKER_16]: So it kind of makes it less of a bastard stepchild in a way and brings it back into the forefront and can definitely bring some new people into it.

01:02:19.601 --> 01:02:22.263
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, they're going for the right target audience right now.

01:02:22.944 --> 01:02:25.926
[SPEAKER_27]: Like I said, you're going for a whole new audience, bringing them into DDR.

01:02:25.946 --> 01:02:28.088
[SPEAKER_27]: You're bringing people who are fitness goers because, like,

01:02:28.459 --> 01:02:28.819
[SPEAKER_27]: DarkSakura.com

01:02:54.276 --> 01:02:59.278
[SPEAKER_07]: That doesn't have children, you probably have never heard of DDR, honestly.

01:02:59.578 --> 01:03:06.081
[SPEAKER_07]: Because either your kids showed you what DDR was, or you're a gamer adult, like most of us are here, and you found DDR on your own.

01:03:06.361 --> 01:03:10.763
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you're a non-gamer adult, I can totally see how you've never heard of DDR, honestly.

01:03:11.063 --> 01:03:14.765
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially if you're a gym bunny, and you don't have time to go to the arcades.

01:03:15.145 --> 01:03:15.985
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it makes sense.

01:03:16.365 --> 01:03:16.905
[SPEAKER_15]: No comment.

01:03:20.219 --> 01:03:23.060
[SPEAKER_27]: But DDR50 Studio, it's actually a pretty fun game.

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:24.400
[SPEAKER_27]: I actually got to try it out myself.

01:03:25.261 --> 01:03:31.443
[SPEAKER_27]: When you go through a whole DDR studio, like the demo that they did, it was about like 25 minutes straight of DDR, of like working out.

01:03:32.003 --> 01:03:40.105
[SPEAKER_27]: And it was a lot of, it was pretty hectic and nothing says like strenuous like boxing the Kakumei.

01:03:43.246 --> 01:03:44.087
[SPEAKER_07]: I gotta see this.

01:03:44.127 --> 01:03:46.707
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really curious if anybody in this area is gonna get it.

01:03:46.727 --> 01:03:47.568
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanna see it.

01:03:47.688 --> 01:03:48.708
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds kinda neat.

01:03:49.472 --> 01:03:50.632
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we expect to see pictures?

01:03:50.653 --> 01:03:52.113
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they going to do a website for it or anything?

01:03:52.133 --> 01:03:52.393
[SPEAKER_07]: Any promos?

01:03:52.413 --> 01:03:53.954
[SPEAKER_07]: What songs do they have on there?

01:03:53.994 --> 01:04:01.116
[SPEAKER_27]: A lot of songs I noticed were from, like, there were actually, I think most of them I caught were, like, from Beatmania type of songs.

01:04:01.756 --> 01:04:05.698
[SPEAKER_27]: But, like, the one I definitely remembered was, um, was all Kakumei.

01:04:05.738 --> 01:04:10.519
[SPEAKER_27]: I think one was, like, something from, I think it was Beatmania 6th, actually.

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:13.940
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, are there songs in this that have not been in DDR yet?

01:04:14.321 --> 01:04:17.682
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, yeah, there are some that are, like, yeah, pretty, like, just new, new.

01:04:17.942 --> 01:04:18.282
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh.

01:04:19.356 --> 01:04:35.489
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm trying to get a bunch of stuff from Jason about it, but the thing is, it's like, you know, Konami's not going to be willing to give us any video footage, so I'm just trying to get either a press release or just get some stills, because I know they were doing stills that day, and I would have brought my DigiCam, but...

01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:37.991
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, I wasn't able to get it.

01:04:38.071 --> 01:04:39.232
[SPEAKER_07]: That's very surprising.

01:04:39.332 --> 01:04:45.556
[SPEAKER_07]: I just assumed that they had taken, like, Max 2 and converted it for this with all those same songs.

01:04:45.596 --> 01:04:46.577
[SPEAKER_07]: That's very surprising that there's new stuff.

01:04:46.597 --> 01:04:49.538
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering if there will be a home release at some point of something like this.

01:04:49.859 --> 01:04:52.360
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, you're going to get people who are like, hey, this is kind of fun.

01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:54.081
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hey, I can do this at home, too.

01:04:54.762 --> 01:04:55.022
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?

01:04:56.162 --> 01:04:57.623
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure that's the direction they want to go.

01:04:57.643 --> 01:05:00.205
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be a pretty smart marketing round, definitely.

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:07.845
[SPEAKER_16]: The other interesting thing to see on that line would be if they make it like, you know how they have those Atari things where you just plug in a joystick and it's like all the old school Atari games?

01:05:08.205 --> 01:05:14.449
[SPEAKER_16]: Because adults who aren't gamers don't have any other reason to get a PlayStation or Xbox, and that just makes the system a heck of a lot more expensive.

01:05:14.809 --> 01:05:18.472
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe just like some sort of standalone thing where you plug it in and plug the pad in and you're ready to go.

01:05:18.663 --> 01:05:19.784
[SPEAKER_07]: That's actually a really smart idea.

01:05:20.644 --> 01:05:21.945
[SPEAKER_07]: You've seen those DDR.

01:05:21.985 --> 01:05:22.905
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see these at the mall.

01:05:23.165 --> 01:05:24.246
[SPEAKER_07]: They suck.

01:05:24.286 --> 01:05:25.506
[SPEAKER_07]: They're shitty little things.

01:05:25.826 --> 01:05:29.628
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like MIDI songs.

01:05:30.649 --> 01:05:31.069
[SPEAKER_27]: They're horrible.

01:05:31.089 --> 01:05:32.530
[SPEAKER_36]: My sister bought that for my nephew.

01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:35.891
[SPEAKER_27]: Wasn't the one that has Survivor by Destiny's Child?

01:05:35.911 --> 01:05:37.892
[SPEAKER_27]: That was basically it, yes.

01:05:37.992 --> 01:05:40.213
[SPEAKER_27]: It's basically playing DDR on the Game Boy.

01:05:51.513 --> 01:06:03.437
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, it'll be interesting to see what develops with this.

01:06:03.697 --> 01:06:11.120
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you've got me all interested with that song list because it makes me think, hmm, could the songs they're using in this be something we see in the next home release?

01:06:12.297 --> 01:06:13.558
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know.

01:06:13.938 --> 01:06:17.261
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll keep talking to the contacts and get what I can.

01:06:17.621 --> 01:06:18.081
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds good.

01:06:18.342 --> 01:06:22.184
[SPEAKER_07]: Does this have an official name yet?

01:06:22.485 --> 01:06:23.465
[SPEAKER_27]: It's called DDR Studio.

01:06:23.505 --> 01:06:25.086
[SPEAKER_27]: Basically, it's out in Japan.

01:06:25.467 --> 01:06:30.550
[SPEAKER_27]: Right now, it's patent pending in America right now because essentially that's what we were doing at the convention.

01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:36.234
[SPEAKER_27]: We were pitching the idea to a bunch of people who were managers of fitness clubs and such.

01:06:36.815 --> 01:06:40.998
[SPEAKER_27]: Essentially, if they garner enough interest, then it's something they'll move forward with.

01:06:41.587 --> 01:06:48.048
[SPEAKER_27]: So it's strictly conceptual on this side of the world, but it's very much reality elsewhere.

01:06:49.729 --> 01:06:53.430
[SPEAKER_36]: You know, if this does show up at my local gym, I am definitely going a lot more.

01:06:53.970 --> 01:06:54.510
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, hell yeah.

01:06:55.630 --> 01:06:57.831
[SPEAKER_07]: I would go much more as well, so it'd be interesting.

01:07:00.071 --> 01:07:02.632
[SPEAKER_07]: Might be motivation for me to get my fat ass up and exercise.

01:07:02.952 --> 01:07:05.532
[SPEAKER_07]: And Loki, good excuse for you to ruin more pants.

01:07:08.490 --> 01:07:09.891
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell is going on here?

01:07:10.171 --> 01:07:12.551
[SPEAKER_07]: Jonas just showed up and he brought a PSP as well.

01:07:12.732 --> 01:07:13.592
[SPEAKER_14]: And he brought us dinner.

01:07:13.712 --> 01:07:16.913
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only because he came last week when we were doing the show.

01:07:16.973 --> 01:07:18.594
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's kind of sad.

01:07:18.854 --> 01:07:22.355
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't you feel like the odd child left out that doesn't have a PSP?

01:07:22.475 --> 01:07:23.295
[SPEAKER_16]: You're so not cool.

01:07:23.315 --> 01:07:23.735
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.

01:07:23.895 --> 01:07:25.156
[SPEAKER_07]: I am not cool, actually.

01:07:26.105 --> 01:07:29.727
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to open up the Skype line in a little bit, but first a couple of quick things.

01:07:30.668 --> 01:07:39.393
[SPEAKER_07]: Shark Scroll, I actually, speaking of PSP, you have an interesting story about how the PSP can sometimes take your place.

01:07:40.654 --> 01:07:43.115
[SPEAKER_16]: The PSP, the DS, anything?

01:07:44.096 --> 01:07:45.736
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you want to talk about, you don't have to talk about this.

01:07:45.757 --> 01:07:47.057
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we want to have the story now?

01:07:47.137 --> 01:07:47.938
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, have the story now.

01:07:48.238 --> 01:07:50.859
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so I have a friend.

01:07:50.899 --> 01:07:51.640
[SPEAKER_16]: What are you doing?

01:07:52.984 --> 01:07:54.444
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta stop you for real quick here.

01:07:54.704 --> 01:07:59.745
[SPEAKER_03]: Jonas just walked in with a lovin' lamb and a ball gag.

01:08:01.145 --> 01:08:03.886
[SPEAKER_03]: An inflatable sex lamb and a ball gag.

01:08:03.946 --> 01:08:05.546
[SPEAKER_07]: Jonas, Jonas, hi Jonas.

01:08:06.006 --> 01:08:08.527
[SPEAKER_07]: Jonas, come here, come here, get on the mic, Jonas.

01:08:10.007 --> 01:08:17.308
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, Sharks girl, but when inflatable lambs and ball gags are brought into play, I don't give a shit about your PSP story anymore.

01:08:17.328 --> 01:08:18.228
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you'll understand.

01:08:18.949 --> 01:08:20.349
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, love ya.

01:08:22.816 --> 01:08:29.037
[SPEAKER_07]: Jonas, now, remind me, you went 40 days with no boner for Lent, right?

01:08:29.317 --> 01:08:29.557
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

01:08:29.717 --> 01:08:36.219
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, how do you go from no boner for 40 days to bringing... Yes, I survived.

01:08:36.319 --> 01:08:44.680
[SPEAKER_24]: How do you go from the... Islanders just finding this out for the first time.

01:08:45.721 --> 01:08:51.902
[SPEAKER_07]: Jonas, how do you go from being Mr. No Boner, for lack of a better term,

01:08:53.112 --> 01:09:01.496
[SPEAKER_07]: to bringing to this show, which has nothing to do with sex last time I checked, an inflatable lamb and a ball gag.

01:09:02.310 --> 01:09:02.950
[SPEAKER_07]: Please explain.

01:09:03.351 --> 01:09:03.851
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

01:09:04.271 --> 01:09:06.172
[SPEAKER_28]: For those who don't notice, I just turned 22 yesterday.

01:09:06.192 --> 01:09:06.792
[SPEAKER_28]: Happy birthday!

01:09:09.654 --> 01:09:14.337
[SPEAKER_28]: And a lot of people gave me some sex stuff, so... So why did you bring it here?

01:09:14.717 --> 01:09:17.358
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you think that we... Did you think... Oh, God!

01:09:17.778 --> 01:09:20.220
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's the last episode of Orange Lounge in that studio.

01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:21.621
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's all fuck a sheep!

01:09:21.781 --> 01:09:22.381
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do it!

01:09:30.638 --> 01:09:31.238
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

01:09:31.338 --> 01:09:34.760
[SPEAKER_06]: If DarkSakura gets too angsty tonight, we'll just shove this ball in her mouth.

01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:36.481
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

01:09:36.761 --> 01:09:37.301
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck that.

01:09:44.665 --> 01:09:47.426
[SPEAKER_07]: Jonas, I don't know what to do with you sometimes.

01:09:48.527 --> 01:09:50.148
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyway, back to Sharks Girl.

01:09:51.568 --> 01:09:52.829
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, please, back to Sharks Girl.

01:09:53.874 --> 01:09:55.895
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, Shark Skrull, but I had to go there.

01:09:55.915 --> 01:09:59.377
[SPEAKER_16]: And you know what's funny is that's just like so par for the course for this story.

01:10:00.857 --> 01:10:03.339
[SPEAKER_15]: Better than being hijacked by Loki's pants.

01:10:05.099 --> 01:10:09.662
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, please, your story about the DS, PSP, etc.

01:10:09.682 --> 01:10:13.944
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I have a friend who is not of any of the circles that anyone knows.

01:10:14.004 --> 01:10:14.544
[SPEAKER_16]: He moved away.

01:10:14.584 --> 01:10:15.064
[SPEAKER_16]: He moved back.

01:10:15.104 --> 01:10:15.504
[SPEAKER_16]: Long story.

01:10:15.584 --> 01:10:16.685
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, so...

01:10:17.287 --> 01:10:17.547
[SPEAKER_16]: Islander.

01:10:17.567 --> 01:10:17.747
[SPEAKER_16]: Harass.

01:10:49.172 --> 01:10:51.334
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, sorry.

01:10:51.714 --> 01:10:56.478
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, so I'm known for being a bit of the gadget junkie.

01:10:56.538 --> 01:10:59.080
[SPEAKER_16]: If it's cool and a new toy, I want it.

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:02.423
[SPEAKER_16]: So I have the iPod.

01:11:02.483 --> 01:11:04.785
[SPEAKER_16]: I almost ended up with a second iPod last weekend.

01:11:04.985 --> 01:11:05.785
[SPEAKER_16]: I have the PSP.

01:11:05.805 --> 01:11:06.306
[SPEAKER_16]: I have the DS.

01:11:06.326 --> 01:11:07.187
[SPEAKER_16]: I have all the fun little things.

01:11:07.407 --> 01:11:08.407
[SPEAKER_06]: Your Veruca game.

01:11:08.748 --> 01:11:10.369
[SPEAKER_06]: I want it, and I want it now, Daddy.

01:11:12.771 --> 01:11:13.672
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, pretty much.

01:11:14.052 --> 01:11:15.093
[SPEAKER_07]: She is a consumer whore.

01:11:15.113 --> 01:11:16.114
[SPEAKER_16]: And how.

01:11:16.294 --> 01:11:16.794
[SPEAKER_16]: And how.

01:11:16.834 --> 01:11:17.274
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, sorry.

01:11:17.294 --> 01:11:17.895
[SPEAKER_07]: I keep interrupting.

01:11:18.581 --> 01:11:24.183
[SPEAKER_16]: So I meet up with said friend and show him, oh, look, I got this nifty new Nintendo DS.

01:11:24.303 --> 01:11:28.225
[SPEAKER_16]: He has proceeded to yell at me if I don't bring the DS with me every time I see him now.

01:11:29.546 --> 01:11:33.167
[SPEAKER_16]: So then he told me not to get a PSP and I ignored him and got a PSP anyway.

01:11:34.288 --> 01:11:36.149
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I said, oh, look what I got a PSP.

01:11:36.329 --> 01:11:38.309
[SPEAKER_16]: And now all he wants to do is play the PSP.

01:11:38.389 --> 01:11:46.353
[SPEAKER_16]: So yes, my friends, I have gone from being seen for just, you know, my loving, charming self as an excuse to

01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:48.141
[SPEAKER_16]: Get to play a DS and a PSP.

01:11:48.181 --> 01:11:49.502
[SPEAKER_16]: And he gets pissed off when I don't bring him.

01:11:49.562 --> 01:11:54.487
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I've decided to screw that, especially when he destroyed two of my games, I found out, when I tried to sell them.

01:11:54.647 --> 01:11:55.068
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoa.

01:11:55.628 --> 01:11:58.511
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I lent him two... What did I lend him?

01:11:58.551 --> 01:12:04.757
[SPEAKER_16]: Two PS2 games, and they were perfect, pristine, and now they're scratched to the point that the place won't buy them back.

01:12:05.597 --> 01:12:07.759
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I'm being used for video games.

01:12:07.799 --> 01:12:08.480
[SPEAKER_16]: Isn't that fun?

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:12.724
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not even rich, and I don't really have all the new stuff, but...

01:12:13.490 --> 01:12:14.410
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

01:12:39.435 --> 01:12:40.958
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, you show it to me and what do I do?

01:12:40.978 --> 01:12:42.119
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I already played that.

01:12:47.247 --> 01:12:50.152
[SPEAKER_16]: So yes, lesson of the story, don't use your friends for their video games.

01:12:50.192 --> 01:12:50.693
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not cool.

01:12:51.113 --> 01:12:51.434
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

01:12:53.116 --> 01:12:53.777
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, um...

01:12:55.359 --> 01:13:01.322
[SPEAKER_07]: We are going to open up the Skype line so you guys can call in because I'm sure you guys have plenty of comments here on this show going on so far.

01:13:02.142 --> 01:13:04.183
[SPEAKER_07]: But first, a couple quick announcements.

01:13:04.424 --> 01:13:09.326
[SPEAKER_07]: Today is the last day that you can vote for the Live365 Awards.

01:13:09.366 --> 01:13:18.190
[SPEAKER_07]: They are closing the polls at midnight, so please, please, please, please, if you haven't yet already, please head on over to Live365.com.

01:13:18.270 --> 01:13:21.532
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, head on over to OrangeLoungeRadio.com and right at the top...

01:13:21.992 --> 01:13:26.577
[SPEAKER_07]: Underneath the webcam, which by the way, the sun is starting to set here in Sacramento, as you can see on the webcam.

01:13:28.932 --> 01:13:35.456
[SPEAKER_07]: You can actually see right underneath the webcam, there's a little box that says, Thank you Live365 and Orange Lounge Radio listeners, a little logo.

01:13:36.036 --> 01:13:38.818
[SPEAKER_07]: Vote for us in the best of Live365 2005.

01:13:39.618 --> 01:13:52.245
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a link right there, www.live365.com slash broadcast slash bcawards.live Since you're listening to this station, you're already a registered Live365 member.

01:13:52.305 --> 01:13:55.227
[SPEAKER_07]: So, please, go to the website and vote.

01:13:55.567 --> 01:14:07.878
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I'm hearing a rumor that they're only counting VIP and other broadcasters, but from what I'm hearing, anybody can see the ballot, so I'm encouraging everybody to go vote.

01:14:08.159 --> 01:14:12.202
[SPEAKER_07]: Even if they are not going to count your vote for whatever reason, at least show your support.

01:14:12.303 --> 01:14:15.525
[SPEAKER_07]: At least make them go, gosh, we have to throw out all these votes for Orange Lounge.

01:14:15.566 --> 01:14:17.147
[SPEAKER_07]: What a bunch of bastard people we must be.

01:14:19.249 --> 01:14:22.570
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's forget him again this year.

01:14:23.170 --> 01:14:24.631
[SPEAKER_07]: Should I play that little reminder there?

01:14:24.711 --> 01:14:26.171
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I just got booted from IRC.

01:14:26.211 --> 01:14:26.751
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not good.

01:14:28.252 --> 01:14:29.592
[SPEAKER_07]: Is the monitor stream still going?

01:14:29.612 --> 01:14:31.173
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

01:14:31.193 --> 01:14:35.274
[SPEAKER_03]: The router and cable modem is fine.

01:14:35.294 --> 01:14:38.355
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the internet's still up, but for whatever reason... And it's still setting.

01:14:38.935 --> 01:14:40.636
[SPEAKER_03]: The sun is still setting in Sacramento.

01:14:41.954 --> 01:14:47.459
[SPEAKER_07]: For whatever reason, we just got the boot from IRC, so we will make our way back into the chat room shortly here.

01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:49.761
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, shoot, I was going to post that link in chat.

01:14:51.123 --> 01:14:52.304
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we'll get back in IRC.

01:14:52.684 --> 01:14:55.026
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess in the meantime, we could go ahead and open up the Skype line.

01:14:55.066 --> 01:14:55.627
[SPEAKER_07]: How's that sound?

01:14:56.748 --> 01:14:57.348
[SPEAKER_04]: Boy, oh boy.

01:14:58.269 --> 01:14:59.871
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's open up the Skype line.

01:15:00.811 --> 01:15:02.572
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember to call into our show.

01:15:02.652 --> 01:15:07.034
[SPEAKER_07]: All you have to do is head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com.

01:15:07.194 --> 01:15:12.596
[SPEAKER_07]: Click on Interact With Us, and you can download a little program called Skype that you can use to interact with us.

01:15:12.676 --> 01:15:17.778
[SPEAKER_07]: Please, guys, tonight, try to keep the calls kind of brief because we're expecting a lot of people want to get in tonight.

01:15:17.838 --> 01:15:19.358
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll start it off with our first caller.

01:15:19.378 --> 01:15:20.639
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:15:21.482 --> 01:15:22.403
[SPEAKER_07]: My Dennis Akum here.

01:15:22.803 --> 01:15:23.364
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, my friend.

01:15:23.384 --> 01:15:23.904
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind?

01:15:25.566 --> 01:15:26.166
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me see.

01:15:26.246 --> 01:15:29.849
[SPEAKER_12]: Just the comments and how, you know, DDR is taking a new path.

01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:37.115
[SPEAKER_12]: Just basically, instead of focusing on more of the gameplay, just focusing on the exercise.

01:15:37.336 --> 01:15:39.377
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a step in another direction.

01:15:39.678 --> 01:15:40.238
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.

01:15:40.278 --> 01:15:40.879
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I said.

01:15:40.959 --> 01:15:42.620
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of like another branch in the road.

01:15:43.161 --> 01:15:43.381
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

01:15:43.401 --> 01:15:43.481
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

01:15:44.381 --> 01:15:54.183
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, I mean, I still have hopes that they're going to make another arcade mix, but I don't expect that, you know, I'm not so fixated on the fact that it is.

01:15:54.844 --> 01:15:56.544
[SPEAKER_12]: But in reality, it might be possible.

01:15:58.024 --> 01:16:00.105
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm trying not to lose hope over it.

01:16:00.385 --> 01:16:01.505
[SPEAKER_12]: No, but think about it.

01:16:01.545 --> 01:16:05.106
[SPEAKER_12]: Logistically, it's possible because they could do it through a third party.

01:16:05.586 --> 01:16:10.007
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, as you know, Betson is their official distributor.

01:16:10.027 --> 01:16:10.427
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

01:16:10.447 --> 01:16:10.548
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

01:16:13.283 --> 01:16:20.847
[SPEAKER_12]: So if they ever wanted to make a mix in America and they needed to bring it out there, they could use them to distribute.

01:16:22.328 --> 01:16:23.469
[SPEAKER_07]: An idea.

01:16:23.669 --> 01:16:30.052
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we're not presidents of Konami Distribution or anything, so we would know, but you never know.

01:16:30.913 --> 01:16:31.813
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an option.

01:16:32.874 --> 01:16:42.539
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's right there in place because even though they shut down their American operations, they can still make the cabinets in Japan and ship them over here, assuming they have a distributor.

01:16:44.741 --> 01:17:05.738
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but you know, I'm just, you know, I don't know, I mean, this whole DDR Studio thing, yeah, it sounds promising, I just hope that, you know, it could just make DDR, you know, not something that would overkill the exposure, but just something that would make it known to almost the average Joe.

01:17:06.767 --> 01:17:09.691
[SPEAKER_12]: because Average Joe Sixpack won't even know what DDR makes.

01:17:09.711 --> 01:17:21.024
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, as you were saying earlier, you can't complain about DDR Studio because, of course, like what, the third reply in that thread was, fuck this game, we want new Konami arcade stuff.

01:17:21.244 --> 01:17:21.625
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't...

01:17:22.125 --> 01:17:24.286
[SPEAKER_14]: I want it in the green studio!

01:17:25.327 --> 01:17:26.848
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't even let me go there yet.

01:17:27.928 --> 01:17:32.851
[SPEAKER_07]: But any new DDR is going to be good for the scene as a whole because it's more exposure.

01:17:33.732 --> 01:17:34.933
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.

01:17:35.033 --> 01:17:37.734
[SPEAKER_12]: Konami's probably playing it both ways.

01:17:38.154 --> 01:17:49.161
[SPEAKER_12]: Trying to appease the scene that pretty much built DDR in this country and then trying to do their own thing by trying to branch out and focus on one aspect of DDR.

01:17:52.344 --> 01:17:54.005
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of like that.

01:17:54.025 --> 01:17:55.046
[SPEAKER_12]: They're playing both ways.

01:17:55.106 --> 01:17:59.290
[SPEAKER_12]: That's pretty much what Konami's doing.

01:17:59.450 --> 01:18:05.555
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't even know whether or not there's going to be another mix in the fall or something like that, or in the near future.

01:18:05.575 --> 01:18:10.139
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we do know that there is one thing that's going to be shown at E3 this year, for sure.

01:18:10.199 --> 01:18:13.742
[SPEAKER_07]: DDR with Mario is definitely going to be shown at E3.

01:18:13.862 --> 01:18:15.663
[SPEAKER_07]: IGN leaked that one earlier this week.

01:18:15.683 --> 01:18:16.524
[SPEAKER_07]: We know about that, so...

01:18:17.285 --> 01:18:20.288
[SPEAKER_12]: But what is Konami going to do to follow up Xtreme and Ultramix 2?

01:18:20.668 --> 01:18:21.108
[SPEAKER_12]: Tell me that.

01:18:21.188 --> 01:18:23.971
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the assumption is something is coming.

01:18:24.011 --> 01:18:33.140
[SPEAKER_12]: They can't just leave us hanging with that, but... They could, I don't know, I could just throw it out there and they probably could port Party Collection to this country and then basically, you know, shoot themselves in the foot.

01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:34.561
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, nah, I... Because...

01:18:36.713 --> 01:18:40.938
[SPEAKER_07]: DDR Extreme was such a radical departure from DDR Extreme in Japan.

01:18:41.359 --> 01:18:43.902
[SPEAKER_07]: Wouldn't you logically think that we're going to get something brand new?

01:18:44.142 --> 01:18:45.303
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not going to port us something over?

01:18:45.323 --> 01:18:46.385
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to get something new?

01:18:47.706 --> 01:18:51.831
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't even know what the Japanese, whatever's left of the DDR scene over there...

01:18:52.811 --> 01:18:59.317
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, the whole, whoever still plays there actually thinks of the new songs that were actually made for Ultramix, you know, and Ultramix 2.

01:19:00.158 --> 01:19:07.564
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really hard to see what they think and how, you know, this is based, you know, on how Ultramix 2 and how we managed to make our own mix.

01:19:07.984 --> 01:19:10.687
[SPEAKER_12]: Something that, you know, American DDR players could call their own.

01:19:11.597 --> 01:19:12.938
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, I agree.

01:19:12.998 --> 01:19:16.860
[SPEAKER_07]: The recent US mixes have far surpassed their Japanese.

01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:23.843
[SPEAKER_07]: Song list arguments aside, I mean, Big Boo Hoo, Cartoon Heroes hasn't been released in the US now.

01:19:24.644 --> 01:19:28.366
[SPEAKER_12]: The games themselves have surpassed Big Boo Hoo.

01:19:29.166 --> 01:19:36.490
[SPEAKER_12]: What they lacked in popular songs from DDR Extreme, they made up for with brand new ones from 2DX and other Bomani.

01:19:37.364 --> 01:19:47.133
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can't argue with that, that they're actually branching out into 2DX and really, you know, really, they're branching out into Bomani that these DDR players are most likely to play.

01:19:47.293 --> 01:19:49.355
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, someone who's been on the inside wants to comment.

01:19:49.375 --> 01:19:50.616
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on, hold on, Taku, hold on.

01:19:51.851 --> 01:19:59.235
[SPEAKER_27]: I was just, I mean, I might be a minute or two behind, but I was hearing something about how, like, the US can break it out into their own as far as, like, DDR goes.

01:19:59.676 --> 01:20:07.740
[SPEAKER_27]: I think that's what was the intention of when Konami of Hawaii was basically assigned to do Ultramix and basically the whole Xbox series.

01:20:08.461 --> 01:20:10.362
[SPEAKER_27]: It's probably, I mean, the reason why I think Ultramix 2...

01:20:11.175 --> 01:20:22.119
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, was the way it was, was because it was essentially, there was a lot of feedback from the American audience, from, you know, Right, hell, we even made the steps for the songs.

01:20:22.499 --> 01:20:22.959
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's we?

01:20:22.979 --> 01:20:25.920
[SPEAKER_12]: Yo, wait a minute, Saku, you didn't do it!

01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:35.043
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I mean, we as DDR players, I mean, you know, as a DDR player, Well, you know, if you're saying that, you know, someone like me represents everyone of you.

01:20:35.223 --> 01:20:36.744
[SPEAKER_07]: Let the man finish, Saku, let the man finish.

01:20:36.984 --> 01:20:37.784
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, you know, it's...

01:20:38.955 --> 01:20:45.181
[SPEAKER_27]: It's something, but to say that's going to be the end of it, I don't think that's necessarily true.

01:20:45.322 --> 01:20:50.427
[SPEAKER_27]: Obviously, we're not going to let you telegraph what we're doing six months down the road or whatever.

01:20:50.867 --> 01:20:54.171
[SPEAKER_27]: In all fairness, I don't even work for the company anymore.

01:20:54.291 --> 01:20:58.175
[SPEAKER_27]: But I just want to trip.

01:20:58.235 --> 01:20:58.776
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, it's like...

01:20:59.286 --> 01:21:07.535
[SPEAKER_27]: If you really want to basically have power as far as dictate what Konami does, buy 51% of their stock.

01:21:07.555 --> 01:21:12.600
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't even know if that's available, but at $20 a pop, that's a lot, man.

01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:16.024
[SPEAKER_07]: Saku, we've got to let you go because other people are trying to get in, but thank you so much for calling.

01:21:16.044 --> 01:21:16.444
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good one.

01:21:18.695 --> 01:21:24.517
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so, you know, again, to sum that one up, any exposure for DDR is going to be a good thing.

01:21:25.278 --> 01:21:25.998
[SPEAKER_07]: And the U.S.

01:21:26.098 --> 01:21:34.101
[SPEAKER_07]: definitely breaking out into their own with Ultramix 2 and DDR Extreme being so radically different from its Japanese counterpart this year.

01:21:34.141 --> 01:21:34.841
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's take another call.

01:21:35.261 --> 01:21:36.202
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:21:37.202 --> 01:21:38.502
[SPEAKER_25]: Hey, Sky, it's Al Mullet.

01:21:38.562 --> 01:21:39.163
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, Al Mullet.

01:21:39.183 --> 01:21:39.763
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind, buddy?

01:21:41.843 --> 01:21:44.688
[SPEAKER_25]: This is one hell of a show you got going on right now.

01:21:45.390 --> 01:21:52.405
[SPEAKER_07]: It's always these shows where we come in, and honestly, I'm going to be honest, like five minutes before the show started tonight, I was just going...

01:21:53.337 --> 01:21:55.077
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's just get this over with.

01:21:55.177 --> 01:21:56.158
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a headache.

01:21:56.358 --> 01:21:58.858
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to get through this show so I can go back to bed.

01:21:59.438 --> 01:22:05.740
[SPEAKER_07]: And now it's like, why is it whenever I approach the show with that attitude, the shows end up being just chaotic funness?

01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:09.100
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I'm glad you approach things with a bland attitude, Skye.

01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:11.661
[SPEAKER_25]: It makes it greater for the rest of us.

01:22:11.901 --> 01:22:17.842
[SPEAKER_07]: Aren't the rest of you so comfortable knowing that, you know, I approach this show with such a positive attitude?

01:22:19.883 --> 01:22:20.803
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, let's do this again.

01:22:20.843 --> 01:22:21.803
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, what's on your mind, Emily?

01:22:22.828 --> 01:22:27.591
[SPEAKER_25]: I recently came into Beatmania 2DX 9th style and I've been having a ball with that.

01:22:28.172 --> 01:22:30.353
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that's good to do to a machine, but okay.

01:22:31.334 --> 01:22:32.915
[SPEAKER_03]: Just stop it, Loki.

01:22:32.935 --> 01:22:33.596
[SPEAKER_03]: Just stop it.

01:22:33.736 --> 01:22:35.557
[SPEAKER_25]: Loki, you already lost this show.

01:22:35.657 --> 01:22:41.041
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't go for two.

01:22:42.702 --> 01:22:43.463
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, Elmo.

01:22:43.563 --> 01:22:45.144
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize for Loki's behavior.

01:22:45.985 --> 01:22:46.545
[SPEAKER_25]: No, don't.

01:22:46.585 --> 01:22:49.567
[SPEAKER_25]: At least I get to burn on him once before you go to your next studio.

01:22:49.987 --> 01:22:50.908
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not dying.

01:22:51.108 --> 01:22:52.129
[SPEAKER_07]: We are starting over.

01:22:53.894 --> 01:22:54.454
[SPEAKER_00]: Good for you.

01:22:54.494 --> 01:22:55.035
[SPEAKER_00]: It's new.

01:22:55.795 --> 01:22:56.135
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

01:22:59.117 --> 01:22:59.397
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

01:22:59.657 --> 01:23:00.718
[SPEAKER_07]: So what else is on your mind now, Mullet?

01:23:01.738 --> 01:23:02.539
[SPEAKER_07]: You got Nine Style.

01:23:02.979 --> 01:23:08.842
[SPEAKER_25]: I got Nine Style, and I do have a PSP now, and I do have Luminous for it.

01:23:09.582 --> 01:23:13.364
[SPEAKER_25]: And I do have a couple other games that are currently collecting dust.

01:23:13.584 --> 01:23:19.768
[SPEAKER_16]: I would like to make a note that currently there are at least three or four PSPs in this room, and I think at least three of them are playing Luminous.

01:23:21.489 --> 01:23:22.109
[SPEAKER_25]: As they should.

01:23:24.797 --> 01:23:33.026
[SPEAKER_25]: It's the one game that I can honestly say is the only reason right now that a PSP should be bought right now.

01:23:33.087 --> 01:23:40.815
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm kind of waiting for PopCap to rip it off like they do all the other puzzle games so that I can play Luminous online.

01:23:40.975 --> 01:23:42.457
[SPEAKER_07]: But they'll probably call it, you know...

01:23:43.328 --> 01:23:45.891
[SPEAKER_07]: Force or Magic Squares or, you know.

01:23:46.412 --> 01:23:47.373
[SPEAKER_07]: Musical Squares.

01:23:47.413 --> 01:23:49.135
[SPEAKER_07]: Musical Squares or something, you know.

01:23:49.315 --> 01:23:53.420
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, PopCap.com, they rip off all the good puzzle games and make their own version.

01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:54.341
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm going to tell them that name.

01:23:54.381 --> 01:23:57.946
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm going to go to PopCap and say, I have a title for your Luminous ripoff.

01:23:58.326 --> 01:23:58.927
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

01:23:59.107 --> 01:23:59.848
[SPEAKER_25]: Give me money.

01:24:01.149 --> 01:24:01.450
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

01:24:02.922 --> 01:24:07.085
[SPEAKER_07]: and we could call it Puzzle Pants as some folks in the chat room are... Oh boy.

01:24:07.726 --> 01:24:07.946
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

01:24:09.467 --> 01:24:13.511
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think about the whole DDR stuff at E3 this year?

01:24:13.531 --> 01:24:14.431
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think we're going to see?

01:24:14.491 --> 01:24:23.819
[SPEAKER_07]: We know that we're going to be seeing DDR with Mario per the earlier Orange Entree report that said IGN blew the lid on that and that we are going to see DDR with Mario at E3.

01:24:24.139 --> 01:24:26.101
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think else is in store for us at E3?

01:24:26.961 --> 01:24:29.964
[SPEAKER_25]: I think we're going to see PS2 and Xbox generations.

01:24:30.405 --> 01:24:34.449
[SPEAKER_25]: We didn't know it was coming in 2002 when DDR Max was announced.

01:24:34.509 --> 01:24:41.296
[SPEAKER_25]: We didn't know anything was coming in 2003 when Max 2... Well, we knew Max 2 was coming, but we didn't know Ultra Mix was coming.

01:24:42.225 --> 01:24:46.468
[SPEAKER_25]: We didn't know Ultramix 2 was coming, even though we knew Extreme was coming in 2004.

01:24:47.088 --> 01:24:50.530
[SPEAKER_25]: We don't know anything outside of DDR with Mario for right now.

01:24:50.630 --> 01:24:53.432
[SPEAKER_25]: We can rest assured we're going to see some new iterations.

01:24:53.512 --> 01:24:57.815
[SPEAKER_25]: I stake my career on it, as in quasi-internet celebrity.

01:24:58.435 --> 01:24:59.235
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, okay.

01:25:00.016 --> 01:25:00.916
[SPEAKER_25]: You heard it here first.

01:25:01.897 --> 01:25:05.899
[SPEAKER_25]: If you don't see any new PS2 or Xbox games, I will retire forever.

01:25:06.940 --> 01:25:08.441
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, that's some strong words there.

01:25:09.346 --> 01:25:11.687
[SPEAKER_07]: You better hope I lose this archive if that does turn out to be true.

01:25:11.727 --> 01:25:12.868
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I am actually with you.

01:25:13.248 --> 01:25:20.851
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to stake my internet celebrity on it because I don't have much to wager, but I do think we are going to see new PS2 and Xbox Mrs. I think it's inevitable.

01:25:20.871 --> 01:25:24.633
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I don't have much to wager either, but there are people that want to see me retire, I'm sure.

01:25:25.433 --> 01:25:27.254
[SPEAKER_07]: Your website, El Mullet.

01:25:27.354 --> 01:25:28.695
[SPEAKER_25]: InsidePulse.com.

01:25:29.555 --> 01:25:29.955
[SPEAKER_07]: Visit it.

01:25:30.015 --> 01:25:30.215
[SPEAKER_07]: Love it.

01:25:30.235 --> 01:25:31.456
[SPEAKER_07]: You haven't had a new column in a while.

01:25:32.443 --> 01:25:33.103
[SPEAKER_25]: That's true.

01:25:33.483 --> 01:25:34.704
[SPEAKER_25]: School's been getting in the way.

01:25:34.744 --> 01:25:36.224
[SPEAKER_25]: I've been taking on some new duties.

01:25:36.304 --> 01:25:44.087
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm the news editor now, which means I have full control over the news board, which is why our news board is so kick-ass right now.

01:25:45.267 --> 01:25:48.388
[SPEAKER_25]: And I might be coming into some more... I've actually been working on a feature.

01:25:49.228 --> 01:25:52.069
[SPEAKER_25]: And believe it or not, it's an In the Groove related feature.

01:25:52.870 --> 01:25:53.270
[SPEAKER_07]: Shock!

01:25:55.570 --> 01:26:00.252
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very curious to see what happens, because I know your feelings on In the Groove, and I'm just kind of...

01:26:01.196 --> 01:26:08.981
[SPEAKER_25]: My feelings aside, this is more of a quasi-promotional piece, let's say, because I got an interview with someone in Red Octane.

01:26:09.021 --> 01:26:11.642
[SPEAKER_25]: They were nice enough to answer some questions I had.

01:26:12.943 --> 01:26:16.425
[SPEAKER_25]: And I'm doing an official ignition pad review.

01:26:16.485 --> 01:26:24.449
[SPEAKER_25]: They were nice enough to supply me with a pad, considering that's going to be the basic controller they're offering for this game.

01:26:24.789 --> 01:26:25.770
[SPEAKER_25]: So how does it hold up?

01:26:27.098 --> 01:26:27.439
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

01:26:27.479 --> 01:26:30.861
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have to check that out when the article comes out.

01:26:30.901 --> 01:26:32.983
[SPEAKER_07]: So keep an eye on InsidePulse.com.

01:26:33.403 --> 01:26:39.688
[SPEAKER_25]: It should be out sometime this week if everything goes well, everything's on time and such.

01:26:39.888 --> 01:26:40.148
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

01:26:40.188 --> 01:26:42.790
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Mullen, I'm going to let you go so I can take another call, but thanks so much for calling in.

01:26:42.830 --> 01:26:43.470
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good one, okay?

01:26:43.771 --> 01:26:44.191
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem.

01:26:44.211 --> 01:26:44.491
[SPEAKER_07]: You too.

01:26:44.611 --> 01:26:44.811
[SPEAKER_07]: Later.

01:26:46.893 --> 01:26:47.073
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes?

01:26:47.594 --> 01:26:52.397
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I always expect El Mullen to come in with a guitar strum like El Cabong's.

01:26:52.617 --> 01:26:52.897
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.

01:26:52.917 --> 01:26:54.899
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to go to another call here.

01:26:54.939 --> 01:26:56.220
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:26:57.096 --> 01:26:57.817
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

01:26:57.877 --> 01:26:59.218
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to check that out.

01:26:59.538 --> 01:27:01.079
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, turn down your volume there.

01:27:01.159 --> 01:27:04.522
[SPEAKER_07]: First rule of radio, turn down the volume because we're hearing ourselves there.

01:27:05.663 --> 01:27:06.084
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

01:27:06.964 --> 01:27:07.285
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you there?

01:27:12.727 --> 01:27:13.728
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't hear him.

01:27:13.888 --> 01:27:16.390
[SPEAKER_07]: I can hear myself, though, and I must say I sound sexy.

01:27:17.692 --> 01:27:18.793
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to check your mic, buddy.

01:27:18.813 --> 01:27:19.393
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't hear you.

01:27:19.413 --> 01:27:19.853
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

01:27:20.434 --> 01:27:21.215
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, my friend.

01:27:21.315 --> 01:27:22.035
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:27:22.196 --> 01:27:24.418
[SPEAKER_07]: Oops, I just hung up on somebody else.

01:27:24.458 --> 01:27:25.338
[SPEAKER_07]: I meant to hang up on that one.

01:27:27.901 --> 01:27:28.481
[SPEAKER_07]: Is somebody there?

01:27:28.881 --> 01:27:29.322
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, we got him.

01:27:29.342 --> 01:27:29.642
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

01:27:29.802 --> 01:27:30.463
[SPEAKER_07]: You're on Orange Sounds Radio.

01:27:30.868 --> 01:27:36.092
[SPEAKER_09]: This is RPGKing7, coming to you from Canada Oh, Canada, what's that about?

01:27:36.292 --> 01:27:40.315
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, not much, you know, weather's been really nice Alright, what's on your mind?

01:27:40.896 --> 01:27:45.559
[SPEAKER_09]: For this time of year What's on your mind, buddy?

01:27:48.701 --> 01:27:49.002
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello?

01:27:49.822 --> 01:27:50.363
[SPEAKER_07]: Did we lose him?

01:27:51.564 --> 01:27:53.865
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I gotta keep the mic turned down Okay

01:27:55.299 --> 01:27:59.262
[SPEAKER_09]: No real news or anything, you know, I'm a bit new to this.

01:28:00.083 --> 01:28:05.047
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, not to DDR, I've been doing DDR for a year and a half, two years now.

01:28:05.387 --> 01:28:09.210
[SPEAKER_09]: Just want to thank you guys for doing the show, it's really awesome.

01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:10.131
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no problem, thank you.

01:28:10.151 --> 01:28:12.093
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought you guys, I'd have nothing to do on Sunday night.

01:28:12.753 --> 01:28:16.656
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's always Desperate Housewives, but it kind of sucks.

01:28:18.478 --> 01:28:20.119
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you get Desperate Housewives in Canada?

01:28:20.379 --> 01:28:20.900
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you don't.

01:28:22.301 --> 01:28:24.102
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing else I can really think of.

01:28:24.543 --> 01:28:27.285
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are quite awesome.

01:28:27.785 --> 01:28:29.807
[SPEAKER_09]: Just keep up with us and good luck with the move and everything.

01:28:30.047 --> 01:28:31.248
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, no problem.

01:28:31.268 --> 01:28:32.489
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for calling in.

01:28:33.329 --> 01:28:35.111
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for being a cool listener.

01:28:35.231 --> 01:28:37.232
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we like compliments and inflate our ego.

01:28:37.412 --> 01:28:40.235
[SPEAKER_15]: By the way, Rob, I love the fact how you're waving goodbye.

01:28:40.255 --> 01:28:41.736
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, I'll sign off now.

01:28:41.756 --> 01:28:42.616
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep going with it.

01:28:42.716 --> 01:28:43.377
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, later.

01:28:44.438 --> 01:28:46.259
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, I think he couldn't hear us.

01:28:46.419 --> 01:28:47.400
We're big in Canada.

01:28:48.061 --> 01:28:49.862
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, yeah, it's nice to know we're big in Canada.

01:28:49.902 --> 01:28:51.243
[SPEAKER_07]: We have an international following.

01:28:52.461 --> 01:28:54.161
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to visit Canada again.

01:28:54.201 --> 01:28:55.602
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a little while since I've been to Canada.

01:28:55.762 --> 01:28:56.582
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to go back and visit.

01:28:56.602 --> 01:28:58.243
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's go to another call.

01:28:58.283 --> 01:28:59.183
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

01:28:59.743 --> 01:29:01.823
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so you know, Sky, you have a great voice.

01:29:01.924 --> 01:29:02.344
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

01:29:02.464 --> 01:29:03.264
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, thank you.

01:29:03.344 --> 01:29:04.044
[SPEAKER_07]: That's so nice.

01:29:05.805 --> 01:29:07.005
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't think it's too faggy?

01:29:07.245 --> 01:29:08.305
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't think it's too faggy?

01:29:09.045 --> 01:29:11.466
[SPEAKER_06]: Because a lot of people say I'm too faggy.

01:29:12.966 --> 01:29:14.387
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah, I don't think so.

01:29:14.467 --> 01:29:14.767
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

01:29:15.347 --> 01:29:16.607
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just the way I am, dammit.

01:29:17.468 --> 01:29:18.748
[SPEAKER_07]: So what if I'm a little nasally?

01:29:20.051 --> 01:29:20.891
[SPEAKER_07]: We love you for it.

01:29:20.932 --> 01:29:21.532
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just it.

01:29:21.712 --> 01:29:22.052
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

01:29:22.092 --> 01:29:22.672
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate it.

01:29:23.792 --> 01:29:26.173
[SPEAKER_07]: Sam Kinison got his career forever with that.

01:29:28.374 --> 01:29:29.855
[SPEAKER_02]: Who was one of my favorite comedians?

01:29:31.215 --> 01:29:31.955
[SPEAKER_07]: That explains it there.

01:29:32.315 --> 01:29:32.956
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind, buddy?

01:29:33.576 --> 01:29:34.036
[SPEAKER_02]: Not much.

01:29:34.116 --> 01:29:35.496
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a couple of stories for you.

01:29:36.257 --> 01:29:37.777
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I told Jamie this one.

01:29:38.197 --> 01:29:40.438
[SPEAKER_02]: I call it the PSP to hell.

01:29:43.459 --> 01:29:46.380
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened was a guy came to return on the PSP.

01:29:47.901 --> 01:29:49.041
[SPEAKER_02]: This is brilliant.

01:29:50.208 --> 01:29:50.388
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh oh.

01:30:18.570 --> 01:30:21.451
[SPEAKER_02]: The screen was cracked into pieces.

01:30:25.813 --> 01:30:26.113
[SPEAKER_07]: Ouch.

01:30:26.934 --> 01:30:29.595
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I've heard about a couple burnt out pixels or two.

01:30:29.755 --> 01:30:30.495
[SPEAKER_07]: Stupid.

01:30:31.496 --> 01:30:32.956
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

01:30:33.076 --> 01:30:33.997
[SPEAKER_07]: So what ended up happening?

01:30:34.857 --> 01:30:37.598
[SPEAKER_02]: General Manager told him, can I give you a refund now?

01:30:37.778 --> 01:30:39.439
[SPEAKER_02]: And he took a swing at the General Manager.

01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:42.600
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I hope you had that boy escorted out.

01:30:43.861 --> 01:30:44.701
[SPEAKER_02]: By the police, yeah.

01:30:45.081 --> 01:30:45.722
[SPEAKER_24]: By the police.

01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:51.521
[SPEAKER_02]: But what happened was the general manager ducked and hit him right in the face and he went out.

01:30:52.862 --> 01:30:53.762
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my gosh.

01:30:54.502 --> 01:30:56.243
[SPEAKER_07]: Drama at a game store.

01:30:56.303 --> 01:30:57.063
[SPEAKER_07]: What the heck?

01:30:58.424 --> 01:31:03.005
[SPEAKER_02]: Best part is, the general manager was a six foot two tall girl.

01:31:04.746 --> 01:31:05.846
[SPEAKER_02]: That is awesome.

01:31:05.926 --> 01:31:06.526
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait a minute.

01:31:06.566 --> 01:31:11.068
[SPEAKER_07]: So this guy went to take a swing at a girl over a PSP which he broke himself.

01:31:11.648 --> 01:31:11.888
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

01:31:12.668 --> 01:31:14.229
[SPEAKER_15]: Stupid, stupid, stupid.

01:31:14.329 --> 01:31:14.709
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh.

01:31:17.199 --> 01:31:17.879
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

01:31:17.959 --> 01:31:19.300
[SPEAKER_07]: Let us know when he's out of jail, okay?

01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:21.960
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, I'll be sure of that.

01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:26.321
[SPEAKER_07]: If we can get his picture, we'll post it on the website as our loser of the month.

01:31:27.262 --> 01:31:27.862
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll try.

01:31:28.202 --> 01:31:28.542
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

01:31:29.442 --> 01:31:30.242
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, sounds good.

01:31:30.582 --> 01:31:31.883
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much for the call and the story.

01:31:31.903 --> 01:31:32.623
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else on your mind?

01:31:33.223 --> 01:31:33.563
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

01:31:33.583 --> 01:31:35.644
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just watching a backlash of drama and shit.

01:31:35.684 --> 01:31:36.604
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just leave it at that.

01:31:37.244 --> 01:31:37.544
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

01:31:37.664 --> 01:31:38.264

01:32:07.421 --> 01:32:14.804
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of people don't really notice Orange Lounge Radio as a gaming station because they think Orange Lounge, what the hell is that?

[SPEAKER_31]: Ah, it's about damn time.

01:33:20.151 --> 01:33:21.331
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, it's crazy.

01:33:21.851 --> 01:33:23.932
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize to those of you guys not getting through tonight.

01:33:23.972 --> 01:33:24.893
[SPEAKER_07]: It's lit up like hell.

01:33:25.653 --> 01:33:26.933
[SPEAKER_31]: It's my fault as well.

01:33:26.953 --> 01:33:29.434
[SPEAKER_31]: It's my fault too because, you know, I got a little bit late.

01:33:30.495 --> 01:33:31.075
[SPEAKER_07]: You lucked out.

01:33:31.095 --> 01:33:32.516
[SPEAKER_07]: The last guy didn't have his mic up.

01:33:32.556 --> 01:33:34.116
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind, buddy?

01:33:34.637 --> 01:33:39.879
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, just helping you out with some Happy Sky song lists that are in Japanese.

01:33:40.479 --> 01:33:40.799
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

01:33:41.283 --> 01:33:42.984
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm gonna tell it, you know, tell it to you.

01:33:43.104 --> 01:33:43.865
[SPEAKER_31]: And here it is.

01:33:44.085 --> 01:33:47.828
[SPEAKER_31]: The genre is disco, and the artist is a dance man featuring disco.

01:33:48.229 --> 01:33:49.730
[SPEAKER_31]: And this is kind of a tongue twister.

01:33:50.190 --> 01:33:53.212
[SPEAKER_31]: The tongue twister is, we are Disco Yotsutatsu Inochi.

01:33:54.794 --> 01:33:55.114
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

01:33:55.794 --> 01:33:56.615
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a mouthful there.

01:33:56.995 --> 01:33:58.657
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, your mic is a little bit quiet.

01:33:58.697 --> 01:34:00.979
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything you can do to make yourself louder would be appreciated by our listeners.

01:34:01.719 --> 01:34:02.820
[SPEAKER_31]: Alright, now it's closer.

01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:03.320
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

01:34:05.217 --> 01:34:09.320
[SPEAKER_31]: I am beat mania, you are what mania?

01:34:09.620 --> 01:34:12.543
[SPEAKER_31]: Ore is a masculine way of saying I. Huh.

01:34:33.169 --> 01:34:34.931
[SPEAKER_06]: I am Beatmania, you are what mania?

01:34:35.652 --> 01:34:36.573
[SPEAKER_06]: You are what mania?

01:34:37.814 --> 01:34:41.158
[SPEAKER_16]: I am Beatmania, you are what?

01:34:41.218 --> 01:34:41.799
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you didn't.

01:34:42.359 --> 01:34:43.180
[SPEAKER_07]: I am Beatmania.

01:34:44.161 --> 01:34:45.463
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, couldn't help myself.

01:34:48.406 --> 01:34:53.351
[SPEAKER_31]: And then there's a hard dance, you know, which is a remix of Got Ticey or Strong Yega.

01:34:54.192 --> 01:34:54.673
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, okay.

01:34:56.141 --> 01:35:14.510
[SPEAKER_31]: and then there's, you know, and then a synthetic, oh, I forgot another, the genre is natural sound and it's by Twin Amadeus, Altaturka on Passion, you know, WN, I cannot pronounce it as UN, and it's very interesting that Altaturka on Passion is the remix of the Turkish March.

01:35:15.548 --> 01:35:16.108
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

01:35:16.128 --> 01:35:18.529
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, the twin armadillos version of the Turkish March.

01:35:18.589 --> 01:35:20.410
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, that should be interesting, the old classic song.

01:35:20.950 --> 01:35:23.451
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, you've been checking out some of the videos, right, from Happy Sky?

01:35:23.911 --> 01:35:24.131
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah.

01:35:24.231 --> 01:35:25.491
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I'm going to play a little clip.

01:35:25.511 --> 01:35:29.873
[SPEAKER_07]: You actually sent me one of Eden, one of the new songs from 12th Cell.

01:35:29.933 --> 01:35:31.913
[SPEAKER_31]: It's my very favorite Terra song.

01:35:31.933 --> 01:35:37.175
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can hear a little bit there of what Eden sounds like, the new Terra song.

01:35:41.797 --> 01:35:42.957
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of double notes in that.

01:35:48.530 --> 01:35:50.731
[SPEAKER_07]: What else can we look forward to in the Happy Sky videos?

01:35:50.751 --> 01:35:53.712
[SPEAKER_07]: What else is in those videos that you think is worth sharing with our listeners?

01:35:53.732 --> 01:35:55.492
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, you already saw ToeJam.

01:35:55.732 --> 01:35:56.992
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I saw the ToeJam video.

01:35:57.012 --> 01:35:57.633
[SPEAKER_07]: That was pretty cool.

01:35:58.153 --> 01:35:59.693
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, I really like the song.

01:35:59.733 --> 01:36:00.914
[SPEAKER_31]: It's the first time I ever heard it.

01:36:01.794 --> 01:36:07.455
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, while I was listening to the song, I just yelled, Yeehaw!

01:36:13.617 --> 01:36:14.938
[SPEAKER_07]: This is coming from the video there.

01:36:14.958 --> 01:36:15.018
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

01:36:17.088 --> 01:36:21.770
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, tempo changes like hell, but that's what you'd expect from ToeJam.

01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:25.731
[SPEAKER_31]: It goes from 103 to 160 BPM.

01:36:26.672 --> 01:36:30.013
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, the 160 BPM is the fastest.

01:36:30.613 --> 01:36:30.913
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

01:36:31.574 --> 01:36:34.115
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else in the videos that looks pretty cool?

01:36:34.135 --> 01:36:38.016
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, there's, whatchamacallit... Yeah, I didn't like the song, It's too plain.

01:36:43.593 --> 01:36:46.415
[SPEAKER_07]: I noticed it looks like a lot of the videos have generics.

01:36:46.575 --> 01:36:48.496
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hoping that changes before the final release.

01:36:48.836 --> 01:36:52.718
[SPEAKER_31]: They will have actual videos when the final product's been released.

01:36:53.198 --> 01:36:54.999
[SPEAKER_31]: Just like the same thing happened to Be Quiet.

01:36:55.699 --> 01:36:56.339
[SPEAKER_07]: That's very true.

01:36:56.359 --> 01:37:00.602
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

01:37:01.690 --> 01:37:05.871
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, we're going to go ahead and let you go because our Skype line is on fire tonight, but thanks for the 2DX update.

01:37:06.011 --> 01:37:13.032
[SPEAKER_07]: And the borrowing of your Japanese accent is always appreciated as well from this very white host.

01:37:13.872 --> 01:37:17.773
[SPEAKER_31]: And so, let me get my catchphrase first.

01:37:18.273 --> 01:37:22.674
[SPEAKER_31]: And so this resident 2DX bastard walks back to the shadows of Bimani style.

01:37:23.214 --> 01:37:23.974
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, my friend.

01:37:24.054 --> 01:37:24.534
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good one.

01:37:25.034 --> 01:37:25.694
[SPEAKER_31]: All right, later.

01:37:27.014 --> 01:37:29.135
[SPEAKER_07]: I like our callers that have their own taglines.

01:37:29.175 --> 01:37:29.735
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty funny.

01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:33.243
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, maybe we can squeeze in one more call.

01:37:33.603 --> 01:37:34.544
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:37:38.347 --> 01:37:40.108
[SPEAKER_07]: It's this guy whose mic wasn't working earlier.

01:37:40.148 --> 01:37:41.329
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you hear us, buddy?

01:37:42.030 --> 01:37:42.450
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello?

01:37:44.452 --> 01:37:45.233
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we still can't hear him.

01:37:45.253 --> 01:37:46.033
[SPEAKER_07]: We still can't hear you.

01:37:46.114 --> 01:37:47.575
[SPEAKER_07]: Turn your mic up or something.

01:37:49.116 --> 01:37:50.077
[SPEAKER_07]: Give him a few more seconds.

01:37:52.859 --> 01:37:53.159
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't!

01:37:53.980 --> 01:37:54.721
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's try another call.

01:37:56.122 --> 01:37:57.243
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:37:57.263 --> 01:37:57.363
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello?

01:37:58.240 --> 01:37:59.841
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, it's me, it's LemonLimeJump.

01:37:59.921 --> 01:38:01.221
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, LemonLimeJump, how are you?

01:38:02.261 --> 01:38:04.902
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, I'm, uh, uh, yeah, I'm here.

01:38:05.962 --> 01:38:07.423
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if there, is that better?

01:38:07.823 --> 01:38:08.903
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we can hear you, what's up?

01:38:09.123 --> 01:38:11.244
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, um, alright.

01:38:12.044 --> 01:38:16.186
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to say, yeah, I don't know why, but for some reason I was up early enough yesterday.

01:38:16.206 --> 01:38:16.506
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello?

01:38:16.966 --> 01:38:17.566
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, we can hear you.

01:38:18.406 --> 01:38:22.448
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay, um... We're just eagerly anticipating your every word.

01:38:22.968 --> 01:38:23.828
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay, I'm just...

01:38:24.386 --> 01:38:25.586
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to turn off the radio.

01:38:25.767 --> 01:38:26.127
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

01:38:26.147 --> 01:38:28.788
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, definitely turn down the radio because it'll throw you off there a little bit.

01:38:29.148 --> 01:38:29.588
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got it.

01:38:30.128 --> 01:38:30.528
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:38:32.809 --> 01:38:41.632
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was actually tuned into the Today Show yesterday, and I guess you probably heard they had that DDR thing on it yesterday.

01:38:41.672 --> 01:38:43.413
[SPEAKER_11]: It was just like a little five-minute segment.

01:38:43.593 --> 01:38:45.734
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I actually didn't hear about DDR on the Today Show.

01:38:46.014 --> 01:38:46.474
[SPEAKER_07]: What happened?

01:38:46.494 --> 01:38:53.677
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I guess they were touting it for its fitness qualities.

01:38:54.468 --> 01:38:57.329
[SPEAKER_11]: They had some fitness expert come in and try to show it off.

01:38:57.389 --> 01:39:02.750
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they had a couple of Cobalt Flux pads plugged into a PS2 or an Xbox or something.

01:39:03.710 --> 01:39:14.672
[SPEAKER_11]: And the thing I found... Okay, one thing I found interesting was that the song that they used for demonstration was Mobile Moga.

01:39:14.772 --> 01:39:18.012
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was thinking, Orange Lounge, Orange Lounge, where you going?

01:39:18.132 --> 01:39:18.933
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's too cute.

01:39:19.933 --> 01:39:20.193
[SPEAKER_11]: And then...

01:39:21.829 --> 01:39:22.869
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, my brain works funny.

01:39:23.029 --> 01:39:23.569
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know why.

01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:25.790
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to interrupt real fast.

01:39:25.810 --> 01:39:28.151
[SPEAKER_07]: Shark Skrull has got this funny look on her face.

01:39:28.191 --> 01:39:29.011
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to share this.

01:39:29.471 --> 01:39:31.292
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh my god, I think you're my voice twin.

01:39:32.992 --> 01:39:35.173
[SPEAKER_07]: Shark Skrull and Lemon Lime Jump do sound very similar.

01:39:35.213 --> 01:39:35.933
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of scary.

01:39:36.193 --> 01:39:38.073
[SPEAKER_11]: Same mannerisms, same voice, same everything.

01:39:38.113 --> 01:39:38.654
[SPEAKER_11]: It's freaky.

01:39:40.374 --> 01:39:42.055
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody says I sound like my sister, though.

01:39:42.775 --> 01:39:46.176
[SPEAKER_06]: Except I don't... Well, now there's three of you.

01:39:46.416 --> 01:39:48.716
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you've got a twin on the West Coast.

01:39:48.856 --> 01:39:51.077
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, there's five, because my family sounds like me, too.

01:39:51.878 --> 01:39:53.018
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow, that's crazy.

01:39:53.119 --> 01:39:53.419
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

01:39:53.999 --> 01:39:58.260
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, you were into another thought there before I let Sharks Girl cut you off there?

01:39:59.081 --> 01:40:00.481
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

01:40:01.302 --> 01:40:06.564
[SPEAKER_11]: But it was one thing that irritated me, and I guess, I don't know, because they needed something for the cameras to focus on.

01:40:06.924 --> 01:40:11.966
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, they demonstrated for like 30 seconds trying to play, and then they had the two guys...

01:40:13.482 --> 01:40:23.005
[SPEAKER_11]: Talking, and they still had the camera focused and they weren't even playing anymore, so it basically had the camera going boo, or the camera focused on the two TV screens going boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.

01:40:23.305 --> 01:40:24.906
[SPEAKER_06]: You too can be a DDR expert!

01:40:27.147 --> 01:40:30.628
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm thinking, what choice of camera shots was that?

01:40:30.908 --> 01:40:31.648
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not quite sure.

01:40:31.708 --> 01:40:33.049
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I say to that director?

01:40:33.729 --> 01:40:34.129
[SPEAKER_11]: FIRED!

01:40:36.630 --> 01:40:38.811
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's a little, yeah.

01:40:45.117 --> 01:40:48.219
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for the update because I had no idea that DDR was on the Today Show.

01:40:48.259 --> 01:40:49.520
[SPEAKER_07]: I somehow completely missed that.

01:40:49.580 --> 01:40:53.063
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish that somebody would send a little clip somehow so we could see that.

01:40:54.033 --> 01:40:57.015
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, hopefully that somebody got that and we can check that out later.

01:40:57.335 --> 01:41:03.139
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, if we can find a clip of the Today Show, we will do, in the great Orange Lounge tradition, we will play it and make fun of it.

01:41:04.761 --> 01:41:05.741
[SPEAKER_11]: Drew Kucky?

01:41:07.503 --> 01:41:10.044
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully not in the Today Show, but we'll see.

01:41:10.204 --> 01:41:10.625
[SPEAKER_07]: You never know.

01:41:11.165 --> 01:41:12.126
[SPEAKER_07]: They are desperate for ratings.

01:41:12.746 --> 01:41:14.247
[SPEAKER_11]: It just made me think of, yeah, NBC.

01:41:14.367 --> 01:41:15.828
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, I know.

01:41:16.789 --> 01:41:19.751
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, this is, yeah, your last show in the studio.

01:41:19.771 --> 01:41:23.114
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not quite sure how the broadcasting works, but...

01:41:27.454 --> 01:41:35.960
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if I'd be broadcasting a show on my birthday, but I just want to say two days ahead of time, I want to say happy birthday to DarkSakura.

01:41:36.501 --> 01:41:37.421
[SPEAKER_11]: We got the same birthday.

01:41:38.382 --> 01:41:39.162
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you guys really?

01:41:39.703 --> 01:41:40.844
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I looked it up.

01:41:41.044 --> 01:41:45.607
[SPEAKER_07]: You and DarkSakura and LemonLimeJump have the same birthday, and she's saying happy birthday to you.

01:41:45.627 --> 01:41:46.668
[SPEAKER_13]: Happy birthday to us!

01:41:47.749 --> 01:41:50.170
[SPEAKER_13]: Because we are so freaking awesome.

01:41:50.571 --> 01:41:51.091
[SPEAKER_13]: Happy birthday!

01:41:54.383 --> 01:41:54.703
[SPEAKER_07]: You're on.

01:41:54.803 --> 01:41:55.083
[SPEAKER_24]: Yay.

01:41:55.183 --> 01:41:55.303
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh.

01:41:55.944 --> 01:41:57.504
[SPEAKER_15]: From my left hand, I turned off the microphone.

01:41:57.584 --> 01:41:57.744
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

01:41:58.584 --> 01:41:59.665
[SPEAKER_15]: Arigato.

01:42:01.485 --> 01:42:02.025
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

01:42:02.105 --> 01:42:03.406
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you girls have a good birthday.

01:42:03.666 --> 01:42:08.427
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm imagining DarkSakura is the lushier of the two of you, so you probably won't be drinking.

01:42:09.028 --> 01:42:11.889
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be boozing like a... Are you a big drinker, LemonLimeJump?

01:42:13.289 --> 01:42:13.829
[SPEAKER_11]: Not yet.

01:42:13.949 --> 01:42:15.650
[SPEAKER_11]: Give me about three years and two days.

01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:17.770
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, she's underage.

01:42:18.251 --> 01:42:18.831
[SPEAKER_24]: My bad.

01:42:18.851 --> 01:42:19.411
[SPEAKER_11]: She's underage.

01:42:19.431 --> 01:42:22.152
[SPEAKER_11]: When you're 21, we're going to have to go hunt you down.

01:42:22.572 --> 01:42:22.752
[SPEAKER_06]: I've...

01:42:24.443 --> 01:42:25.204
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm good with it.

01:42:25.584 --> 01:42:26.625
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got a good composure.

01:42:26.725 --> 01:42:27.766
[SPEAKER_11]: This stuff doesn't bother me.

01:42:28.927 --> 01:42:30.468
[SPEAKER_11]: You hear worse on cable TV anyway.

01:42:30.488 --> 01:42:34.812
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, not the cursing, but like... Okay, never mind.

01:42:34.832 --> 01:42:35.592
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just taking a bigger hold.

01:42:35.632 --> 01:42:36.253
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, it's alright.

01:42:36.273 --> 01:42:36.633
[SPEAKER_07]: It's alright.

01:42:37.314 --> 01:42:42.037
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's all about Loki's pants.

01:42:43.439 --> 01:42:49.303
[SPEAKER_11]: For a couple last words I wanted to say, I just wanted a few last words to say.

01:42:49.704 --> 01:42:49.984
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.

01:42:51.025 --> 01:42:51.305
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

01:42:51.325 --> 01:42:51.405
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

01:42:52.577 --> 01:43:06.921
[SPEAKER_11]: Legs, clothing, baggies, bell bottoms, bells, bermudas, bloomers, boxer shorts, breeches, beefs, britches, chaps, chinos, clam jiggers, cords, corduroys, zenims, drawers, stone grease, jeans, jodipers, knickers, longies, overalls, pantaloons, panties, pedal pushers, pegs, shorts, slacks, trousers, and underpants.

01:43:07.442 --> 01:43:07.902
[SPEAKER_11]: And now you know.

01:43:09.246 --> 01:43:09.767
[SPEAKER_06]: They're pants.

01:43:11.828 --> 01:43:14.731
[SPEAKER_07]: Mel had a confused look on his face.

01:43:14.771 --> 01:43:16.713
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got one of those looks like he's mid-eating.

01:43:16.773 --> 01:43:18.314
[SPEAKER_07]: He's about to shove some cake in his mouth.

01:43:18.715 --> 01:43:19.976
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he's like, huh?

01:43:20.416 --> 01:43:21.617
[SPEAKER_07]: What is this chick saying?

01:43:21.958 --> 01:43:23.039
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, it's pants, Mel.

01:43:23.079 --> 01:43:23.419
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pants.

01:43:24.180 --> 01:43:25.741
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for sharing.

01:43:25.821 --> 01:43:28.083
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I'm done with pants for the night.

01:43:28.404 --> 01:43:29.685
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening to you all.

01:43:29.745 --> 01:43:30.766
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for calling in, hon.

01:43:31.286 --> 01:43:31.767
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good one.

01:43:33.869 --> 01:43:34.730
[SPEAKER_07]: Our listeners are so funny.

01:43:36.138 --> 01:43:38.419
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we can let one more call sneak in here.

01:43:38.479 --> 01:43:39.819
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm liking the sky plane tonight.

01:43:39.839 --> 01:43:40.599
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody's getting in.

01:43:42.379 --> 01:43:43.960
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll see if anybody else gets in.

01:43:44.020 --> 01:43:49.741
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, one more time, please take a second, vote for our podcast.

01:43:49.781 --> 01:43:51.381
[SPEAKER_07]: We would totally appreciate that.

01:43:51.421 --> 01:43:53.121
[SPEAKER_07]: It's podcastalley.com.

01:43:53.981 --> 01:43:55.482
[SPEAKER_07]: And then just do a search for Orange Lounge.

01:43:55.562 --> 01:43:58.642
[SPEAKER_07]: Or better yet, I'll just post the link right there in the chat room and you guys can vote.

01:43:58.922 --> 01:43:59.402
[SPEAKER_07]: How's that sound?

01:43:59.723 --> 01:44:00.963
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's go ahead and take this call.

01:44:01.483 --> 01:44:02.303
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:44:03.584 --> 01:44:08.306
[SPEAKER_31]: Hey, what do you call a binary star system that distributes energy from one star into the other?

01:44:08.826 --> 01:44:09.006
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

01:44:09.026 --> 01:44:09.426
[SPEAKER_31]: Algal.

01:44:09.846 --> 01:44:11.767
[SPEAKER_31]: It's John Fields, your fan.

01:44:12.227 --> 01:44:13.008
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind?

01:44:13.988 --> 01:44:20.150
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, I was thinking about the upcoming E3, and, you know, it's been quite a while since we've been hit with an arcade release of DDR.

01:44:21.011 --> 01:44:23.612
[SPEAKER_31]: So I'm wondering if they might actually spring that on us.

01:44:24.352 --> 01:44:30.954
[SPEAKER_07]: So John thinks that a possible arcade release could be something that would be shown at E3.

01:44:30.974 --> 01:44:31.014
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

01:44:33.476 --> 01:44:38.404
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have to say, unfortunately, it's very doubtful because E3 is typically a consumer electronic show.

01:44:38.564 --> 01:44:43.972
[SPEAKER_07]: A new arcade mix would be something more for something like, what's the big arcade show they do in Vegas every year?

01:44:44.313 --> 01:44:45.474
[SPEAKER_07]: Coin-Op, something?

01:44:49.119 --> 01:44:51.760
[SPEAKER_07]: CES, Consumer Electronics Show, but they show arcade games there.

01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:52.420
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes no sense.

01:44:52.720 --> 01:45:01.383
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, okay, but I did once, though, it's not unheard of, because I did see last year, and Amira was showing off, of all people.

01:45:01.463 --> 01:45:03.584
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't a pump-it-up game, but they were showing off an arcade game.

01:45:03.604 --> 01:45:04.404
[SPEAKER_07]: That game was cool.

01:45:04.424 --> 01:45:06.564
[SPEAKER_07]: That Korean tank, was it a tank game?

01:45:06.584 --> 01:45:07.365
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a shooting game.

01:45:07.425 --> 01:45:08.305
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like a shooting game?

01:45:08.465 --> 01:45:12.106
[SPEAKER_15]: And you had your controls on your gun, and then you had your fire buttons on your gun.

01:45:12.506 --> 01:45:14.987
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm not going to say can't happen.

01:45:15.487 --> 01:45:17.769
[SPEAKER_07]: But very, very unlikely.

01:45:17.829 --> 01:45:19.070
[SPEAKER_07]: But boy, wouldn't that be nice.

01:45:19.291 --> 01:45:20.311
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it would.

01:45:22.553 --> 01:45:30.260
[SPEAKER_31]: I guess also, since I am going to plug this anytime I can, I'll give you a little more information on Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst.

01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:31.301
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, sure, why not?

01:45:32.482 --> 01:45:35.505
[SPEAKER_31]: This game has been confirmed for the USA and Europe now.

01:45:37.005 --> 01:45:41.349
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard about the new, there was like a Phantasy Star Universe that was coming, but that's a different thing, right?

01:45:41.870 --> 01:45:44.433
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, that is actually the next incarnation of the game.

01:45:44.553 --> 01:45:49.058
[SPEAKER_31]: Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst is basically the next Phantasy Star Online.

01:45:49.198 --> 01:45:54.444
[SPEAKER_31]: It's going to have Episode 4 and all that sort of stuff on it, plus a bunch of new chat options.

01:45:55.025 --> 01:45:56.467
[SPEAKER_31]: And it's slated for a June 2005 release.

01:45:57.972 --> 01:45:58.392
[SPEAKER_07]: Very cool.

01:45:58.432 --> 01:45:59.192
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking forward to it.

01:45:59.432 --> 01:46:00.533
[SPEAKER_07]: I do like Fancy Star.

01:46:01.073 --> 01:46:02.473
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad to see they're still sticking with it.

01:46:03.133 --> 01:46:03.374
[SPEAKER_31]: Yep.

01:46:04.154 --> 01:46:06.214
[SPEAKER_31]: Yuji Naka is not going to let this thing die.

01:46:06.494 --> 01:46:06.774
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

01:46:07.855 --> 01:46:08.435
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't let it die.

01:46:09.875 --> 01:46:10.696
[SPEAKER_31]: I'll talk to you later.

01:46:10.716 --> 01:46:10.896
[SPEAKER_31]: All right.

01:46:10.916 --> 01:46:11.496
[SPEAKER_31]: Have a good one, buddy.

01:46:11.976 --> 01:46:12.216
[SPEAKER_31]: All right.

01:46:12.296 --> 01:46:12.576
[SPEAKER_07]: Later.

01:46:13.636 --> 01:46:14.036
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

01:46:14.116 --> 01:46:22.279
[SPEAKER_07]: Boy, we should... I feel bad because there's still people trying to get in, but I'm like, we kind of need to move on.

01:46:23.679 --> 01:46:24.219
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't we do this?

01:46:24.359 --> 01:46:24.539
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh?

01:46:25.380 --> 01:46:25.720
[SPEAKER_07]: One more?

01:46:25.900 --> 01:46:26.680
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, one more.

01:46:27.230 --> 01:46:27.891
[SPEAKER_07]: One more call.

01:46:29.572 --> 01:46:32.013
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to do one more call, so please hurry up, get in.

01:46:33.214 --> 01:46:39.178
[SPEAKER_07]: www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on Interact With Us, and you can get in on the Skype line.

01:46:39.259 --> 01:46:46.384
[SPEAKER_07]: Skype is a program that you download, and it allows you to call our show so that we don't have to shell out the money for an 800 number because we don't really want to do that.

01:46:49.426 --> 01:46:52.808
[SPEAKER_07]: What's interesting is that in the next studio, we're not going to have a landline.

01:46:53.989 --> 01:46:55.850
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, let's go to one more call.

01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:56.891
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:47:01.479 --> 01:47:02.760
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, can you hear us?

01:47:04.861 --> 01:47:05.922
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard a little fart noise.

01:47:06.062 --> 01:47:06.962
[SPEAKER_07]: That was about it.

01:47:08.543 --> 01:47:10.624
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, everybody.

01:47:12.225 --> 01:47:13.766
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Stan Peel.

01:47:15.147 --> 01:47:15.988
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you?

01:47:18.629 --> 01:47:19.290
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.

01:47:21.511 --> 01:47:22.351
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you hear me?

01:47:22.611 --> 01:47:23.432
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I can.

01:47:24.372 --> 01:47:25.533
[SPEAKER_07]: I can hear myself, too.

01:47:27.034 --> 01:47:28.435
[SPEAKER_08]: It's me, Stan Peel.

01:47:28.475 --> 01:47:30.036
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you doing, everybody?

01:47:35.260 --> 01:47:38.380
[SPEAKER_08]: I just gotta say, I love this DDR stuff, man.

01:47:38.780 --> 01:47:40.541
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great for picking up the youngins.

01:47:42.961 --> 01:47:45.381
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that what you wanted to call in tonight?

01:47:45.902 --> 01:47:48.562
[SPEAKER_08]: Turn down the audio because we're hearing ourselves.

01:47:51.363 --> 01:47:52.583
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that DDR.

01:47:52.603 --> 01:47:53.443
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you hear me now?

01:47:53.563 --> 01:47:54.263
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I can hear you.

01:47:54.623 --> 01:47:55.503
[SPEAKER_08]: But I can hear myself.

01:47:55.603 --> 01:47:56.203
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the problem.

01:47:57.764 --> 01:47:59.564
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no, you shouldn't be able to hear yourself.

01:48:01.206 --> 01:48:01.786
[SPEAKER_08]: That's bad.

01:48:01.906 --> 01:48:03.808
[SPEAKER_08]: You hear yourself, that means you're talking in your head.

01:48:08.090 --> 01:48:08.490
[SPEAKER_08]: It's me.

01:48:08.590 --> 01:48:09.251
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm back, man.

01:48:09.271 --> 01:48:10.171
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that DDR.

01:48:10.191 --> 01:48:11.892
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great for picking up the young ones.

01:48:17.476 --> 01:48:22.218
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you related to Michael Jackson?

01:48:22.238 --> 01:48:27.482
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, that's not very nice to say.

01:48:27.962 --> 01:48:29.823
[SPEAKER_08]: How dare you insult me like that?

01:48:31.843 --> 01:48:32.844
[SPEAKER_08]: Call me a pedophile.

01:48:32.864 --> 01:48:33.844
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not a pedophile.

01:48:33.924 --> 01:48:36.185
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just a connoisseur of the young flesh.

01:48:42.488 --> 01:48:45.210
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are you calling in to the show?

01:48:46.430 --> 01:48:47.411
[SPEAKER_08]: Why am I calling in?

01:48:47.431 --> 01:48:48.932
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you why I'm calling in.

01:48:49.872 --> 01:48:51.913
[SPEAKER_08]: I like to say hello.

01:48:52.373 --> 01:48:55.555
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:48:55.575 --> 01:48:59.717
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you guys are doing a wonderful service.

01:49:02.110 --> 01:49:02.550
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you.

01:49:02.570 --> 01:49:03.251
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate it.

01:49:05.432 --> 01:49:09.375
[SPEAKER_08]: You make it easy for us to pick up on the onions.

01:49:10.076 --> 01:49:12.618
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you in our chat room right now picking up on the onions again?

01:49:13.859 --> 01:49:16.681
[SPEAKER_08]: Who says I'm in your chat room?

01:49:18.742 --> 01:49:20.223
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I was going to invite you in.

01:49:20.283 --> 01:49:22.305
[SPEAKER_07]: Just head on over to OrangeLinesRadio.com.

01:49:24.614 --> 01:49:26.796
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't know who's in there.

01:49:27.516 --> 01:49:32.560
[SPEAKER_08]: I could be standing right next to you in the chat room looking at you going, that's your precious young thing.

01:49:37.423 --> 01:49:38.524
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm speechless.

01:49:41.085 --> 01:49:42.266
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's a first.

01:49:45.208 --> 01:49:47.590
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey-oh, Rob is speechless, everybody.

01:49:50.956 --> 01:49:52.737
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that wonderful Jamie there?

01:49:53.177 --> 01:49:54.018
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Jamie's here.

01:49:54.478 --> 01:49:58.100
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie, Sam wants to talk to you.

01:49:58.500 --> 01:50:01.682
[SPEAKER_08]: I have Crayola sketches of your boobies.

01:50:04.623 --> 01:50:07.564
[SPEAKER_08]: I like using the peach because it's realistic.

01:50:15.048 --> 01:50:16.569
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh-oh, I got company.

01:50:19.181 --> 01:50:20.442
[SPEAKER_08]: I got somebody here with me.

01:50:20.722 --> 01:50:21.143
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm Ms.

01:50:21.183 --> 01:50:21.623
[SPEAKER_08]: Cleo.

01:50:22.144 --> 01:50:22.864
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, hello.

01:50:24.586 --> 01:50:25.747
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello, how are you today?

01:50:25.987 --> 01:50:26.648
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm good.

01:50:26.708 --> 01:50:27.368
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you?

01:50:28.569 --> 01:50:29.430
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hearing things.

01:50:29.510 --> 01:50:29.931
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you?

01:50:32.453 --> 01:50:33.114
[SPEAKER_09]: How's Ms.

01:50:33.134 --> 01:50:33.514
[SPEAKER_08]: Cleo doing?

01:50:33.534 --> 01:50:33.974
[SPEAKER_08]: Pardon me?

01:50:40.492 --> 01:50:41.753
[SPEAKER_06]: Does Riz Khalil play DDR?

01:50:41.813 --> 01:50:48.318
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm hearing an echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo.

01:50:51.180 --> 01:50:52.021
[SPEAKER_08]: Give me a minute.

01:50:52.081 --> 01:50:53.482
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me try something here.

01:50:53.922 --> 01:50:58.185
[SPEAKER_08]: I think having two phones connected together is kind of screwing it all up.

01:51:03.849 --> 01:51:06.271
[SPEAKER_08]: Jeez, Rob, don't cry till you pee your pants.

01:51:07.873 --> 01:51:09.514
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll leave that to you, Stan.

01:51:09.854 --> 01:51:11.475
[SPEAKER_06]: You sound like you're getting a little there.

01:51:11.555 --> 01:51:13.155
[SPEAKER_06]: You might be getting to that point.

01:51:16.217 --> 01:51:17.837
[SPEAKER_08]: Jesus, you sound like a freaking harpy.

01:51:17.857 --> 01:51:19.118
[SPEAKER_08]: What the hell is going on?

01:51:20.038 --> 01:51:20.899
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, Stan.

01:51:20.939 --> 01:51:22.179
[SPEAKER_08]: It's your fault.

01:51:24.140 --> 01:51:25.081
[SPEAKER_24]: Pardon me?

01:51:28.242 --> 01:51:31.023
[SPEAKER_08]: My god, things have all gone kooky-kooky-dooky.

01:51:35.425 --> 01:51:36.085
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, there we go.

01:51:36.566 --> 01:51:37.306
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no, that didn't work.

01:51:40.087 --> 01:51:47.952
[SPEAKER_06]: Stan, before this echo kills us all, any final words you want to say on this call?

01:51:49.813 --> 01:51:52.335
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, well, well, God, I can't even do that for real.

01:51:52.355 --> 01:51:53.076
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just freaky.

01:51:54.877 --> 01:52:02.502
[SPEAKER_08]: All I got to say is to all you youngins playing DDR, hello, there we are, just remember one thing.

01:52:03.911 --> 01:52:08.472
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't know who's watching behind you.

01:52:08.572 --> 01:52:10.513
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Stan.

01:52:10.733 --> 01:52:11.833
[SPEAKER_08]: Peace out, everybody.

01:52:12.073 --> 01:52:12.954
[SPEAKER_07]: Peace out, Stan.

01:52:16.595 --> 01:52:18.455
[SPEAKER_15]: I had to send my ninjas after that picture.

01:52:19.335 --> 01:52:19.795
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

01:52:23.136 --> 01:52:24.957
[SPEAKER_15]: Did I suggest taking one more call?

01:52:24.997 --> 01:52:25.537
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

01:52:25.577 --> 01:52:27.618
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was you that said take one more call.

01:52:27.758 --> 01:52:29.498
[SPEAKER_06]: I was ready to move on to the next segment.

01:52:36.889 --> 01:53:03.759
[SPEAKER_07]: Crayola sketches of your boobies DarkSakura you know what and right there hey fellow broadcasters and VIPs listening tonight there's your consideration clip for most unlikely to hear on AM FM radio thank you this has been an Orange Lounge presentation oh hell

01:53:04.284 --> 01:53:06.826
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we're going to close the Skype line for now, but we will come back later.

01:53:07.166 --> 01:53:12.671
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to go to another break, but we're actually kind of starting to run behind in show, so I think we ought to just go into the next segment, which is kind of weird.

01:53:13.752 --> 01:53:18.076
[SPEAKER_07]: But we're going to go into the Orange Lounge Cage Match, because we need a break, because my face hurts from laughing.

01:53:18.636 --> 01:53:19.156
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously.

01:53:19.637 --> 01:53:22.279
[SPEAKER_07]: And some of our folks in our chat room are saying that too, that they haven't laughed.

01:53:22.299 --> 01:53:24.401
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you need pants for your face so you can be a butthead?

01:53:26.583 --> 01:53:27.163
[SPEAKER_07]: Listen, you.

01:53:29.605 --> 01:53:30.246
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, um...

01:53:34.324 --> 01:53:35.925
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry to those of you guys that didn't get through.

01:53:36.806 --> 01:53:44.690
[SPEAKER_07]: We will open up the Skype line at the end of the show if we have more time, which I'm thinking we will, if we can go ahead and move on to our next segment, which is the Cage Match.

01:53:44.810 --> 01:53:57.218
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, in tonight's Cage Match... We have a very interesting scenario in tonight's Cage Match, because we have a song going for a five-week victory tonight.

01:53:58.012 --> 01:54:00.374
[SPEAKER_07]: I tried coming in last week.

01:54:18.801 --> 01:54:19.641
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

01:54:34.827 --> 01:54:37.649
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so, again, a reminder of the way the cage match works.

01:54:37.929 --> 01:54:39.410
[SPEAKER_07]: We play three songs for you guys.

01:54:39.570 --> 01:54:41.151
[SPEAKER_07]: Last week's winner and two new songs.

01:54:41.171 --> 01:54:44.253
[SPEAKER_07]: We play a clip of last week's winner, two new songs in their entirety.

01:54:44.313 --> 01:54:49.697
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys vote for your favorites, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:54:50.097 --> 01:54:53.259
[SPEAKER_07]: Doesn't have to be a Bomani song, doesn't have to have anything to do with Bomani.

01:54:53.499 --> 01:54:55.601
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just songs that we think are cool.

01:54:56.001 --> 01:54:57.102
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know what?

01:54:57.162 --> 01:55:00.704
[SPEAKER_07]: This cage match, we do have a way of setting trends, because may I remind you...

01:55:01.463 --> 01:55:05.084
[SPEAKER_07]: What songs have we played in the cage match previously that went on to win?

01:55:06.025 --> 01:55:12.247
[SPEAKER_07]: Lava, Wherever You Are, Delirium, After All, Jason Nevins, I'm In Heaven With You.

01:55:12.767 --> 01:55:14.148
[SPEAKER_07]: Where did all these songs end up?

01:55:14.588 --> 01:55:19.490
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm, DDR, so you never know what might come of the Orange Lounge Radio cage match.

01:55:19.530 --> 01:55:23.692
[SPEAKER_07]: So here it is going for its very, maybe, last win and retirement.

01:55:23.992 --> 01:55:26.473
[SPEAKER_07]: Yoko Kanno, song number one with Rise.

01:55:26.633 --> 01:55:26.933
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoy.

01:55:57.839 --> 01:55:58.260
S, Actdeft,

01:56:39.518 --> 01:56:40.282
Thanks for watching!

01:57:18.522 --> 01:57:35.098
I want to stand in this waking hell I am With nothing more than I can confuse Pray myself please don't forget Life betrayed and the oppressed Please give me the strength to be at home

01:58:10.248 --> 01:58:14.171
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, that was a clip of song number one, Yoko Kanno, Rise.

01:58:14.311 --> 01:58:19.815
[SPEAKER_07]: Possibly the third song in Orange Lounge history to be retired tonight, but it's gotta be two competitors.

01:58:20.275 --> 01:58:24.698
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to win, just like every other cage match retiree has done four weeks in a row.

01:58:25.158 --> 01:58:31.963
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so the first competitor tonight is my choice, and I'm choosing somebody with kind of a college spin.

01:58:32.303 --> 01:58:33.204
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm choosing Beck.

01:58:33.877 --> 01:58:45.261
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a reason why I'm choosing Beck tonight, because Beck's latest EP, he actually did all these 8-bit style remixes of songs from his latest album.

01:58:45.561 --> 01:58:49.442
[SPEAKER_07]: And some of it is just way too cool, I had to put one in the cage match.

01:58:49.742 --> 01:58:58.666
[SPEAKER_07]: So here it is, song number two, this is Beck with a song called Ghetto Chip Malfunction, and it's actually a song called Hell Yes, remixed by 8-Bit.

01:58:58.966 --> 01:58:59.826
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoy, song number two.

01:59:04.866 --> 01:59:05.167
Yes.

01:59:13.306 --> 01:59:39.938
[SPEAKER_21]: Looking for my place on the summary lines, fake prizes rising out of the bomb holes Skeleton boys hyped up and purple, smoke rings come from across the disco Banknotes burn like broken equipment, looking for shelter, readjust your position Thought control goes with a confession, two dimensions Dumb your head down, duck, don't look now Company missiles, powers rot, you and the cops are watching Make your dreams out of paper mache

01:59:40.458 --> 02:00:07.315
[SPEAKER_20]: Cliché, wasted, hate taste, that's hell Hell yes, now I'm moving this way, I'm doing this thing Hell yes, now I'm turning it on, now I'm working my legs Hell yes, now I'm calling you out, I'm switching my plates Hell yes, now I'm cleaning the floor, my beat is correct Hell yes, yeah that's it, yeah that's it, yeah that's it

02:00:09.068 --> 02:00:09.768
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, that's it.

02:00:24.352 --> 02:00:50.659
[SPEAKER_21]: Pointless, fools anointed to the following stand fair Look for the common, not superficial Cold, red, cold, I woke up home in a crisis For fuck every idols, rewriting the bibles For magic, markers running out of the ink Lives in white out, turn the lights out Fact machine anthems, get your damn hands up Hell yes, now I'm moving this way, I'm doing this thing Hell yes, now I'm turning it on, I'm working my legs

02:00:51.992 --> 02:01:03.265
[SPEAKER_20]: Hell yes, now I'm calling you out, I'm switching my place Hell yes, now I'm clearing the floor, my beat is great Yes, yes, hi, hi, hi

02:01:13.234 --> 02:01:13.834
[SPEAKER_19]: Outro Music

02:01:48.584 --> 02:01:51.465
[SPEAKER_07]: Nevermind that guitar riff there, that accidentally went into the next song there.

02:01:51.745 --> 02:01:54.866
[SPEAKER_07]: That was song number two, Ghetto Chip Malfunction by Beck.

02:01:54.966 --> 02:01:56.186
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see what everybody thought of that.

02:01:56.647 --> 02:01:57.387
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.

02:01:58.607 --> 02:01:59.508
[SPEAKER_15]: That was pretty cool.

02:01:59.608 --> 02:02:04.649
[SPEAKER_15]: It would give me a headache if I listened to it on repeat, which I would probably do.

02:02:05.409 --> 02:02:06.470
[SPEAKER_15]: So I give it a nine.

02:02:06.970 --> 02:02:08.170
[SPEAKER_15]: A very solid nine.

02:02:08.230 --> 02:02:13.172
[SPEAKER_07]: The EP actually has four songs on it, all in that same style, so it's kind of cool.

02:02:13.212 --> 02:02:16.473
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been listening to very diverse things lately, that's right up my alley, so yeah.

02:02:16.906 --> 02:02:17.346
[SPEAKER_07]: Very cool.

02:02:17.726 --> 02:02:19.707
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's see who's next.

02:02:19.727 --> 02:02:20.487
[SPEAKER_07]: Who else has got a mic?

02:02:20.507 --> 02:02:21.167
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's got a mic over there?

02:02:21.187 --> 02:02:21.487
[SPEAKER_07]: Jonas.

02:02:21.987 --> 02:02:22.368
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see.

02:02:22.848 --> 02:02:24.208
[SPEAKER_28]: Orgasmic Nostalgia.

02:02:24.628 --> 02:02:25.308
[SPEAKER_28]: It's pretty good.

02:02:25.969 --> 02:02:26.989
[SPEAKER_28]: I like it.

02:02:27.189 --> 02:02:27.509
[SPEAKER_28]: A nine.

02:02:27.689 --> 02:02:28.149
[SPEAKER_07]: A nine.

02:02:28.449 --> 02:02:28.729
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

02:02:29.229 --> 02:02:29.730
[SPEAKER_07]: Shark Skrull.

02:02:31.550 --> 02:02:33.631
[SPEAKER_16]: That was pretty nifty, and I don't normally like that.

02:02:34.251 --> 02:02:38.472
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think the remix part of it made it really kind of cool, and I liked the hell yes at the end.

02:02:38.512 --> 02:02:39.352
[SPEAKER_16]: I was like, oh, nifty.

02:02:39.892 --> 02:02:40.092
[SPEAKER_16]: So 9.3759.

02:02:40.513 --> 02:02:41.813
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

02:02:41.853 --> 02:02:42.273
[SPEAKER_16]: Islander.

02:02:47.924 --> 02:02:49.944
[SPEAKER_36]: Angel It's back, it's a 9

02:03:16.392 --> 02:03:18.813
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually don't typically care for Beck a whole lot.

02:03:18.853 --> 02:03:21.834
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, he's okay, but again, the 8-bit thing does it for me.

02:03:21.934 --> 02:03:22.394
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it.

02:03:22.514 --> 02:03:23.214
[SPEAKER_07]: Please enjoy.

02:03:23.234 --> 02:03:23.214
9.

02:03:24.235 --> 02:03:24.535
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

02:03:25.255 --> 02:03:29.536
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see if song number 3 is going to win tonight.

02:03:29.636 --> 02:03:31.257
[SPEAKER_07]: And song number 3 is Loki's pick.

02:03:31.357 --> 02:03:32.877
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, what did you pick for us tonight?

02:03:34.798 --> 02:03:36.158
[SPEAKER_07]: My computer's down right now.

02:03:36.218 --> 02:03:36.919
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in pieces.

02:03:37.359 --> 02:03:39.960
[SPEAKER_16]: Please don't let it be Papa Smurf lick my ass.

02:03:40.520 --> 02:03:43.401
[SPEAKER_03]: I already submitted that one, so that doesn't work.

02:03:44.021 --> 02:03:44.101
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah.

02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:53.547
[SPEAKER_03]: No, um, this song, I had Jamie find me a song real quick, and that's right, folks.

02:03:54.107 --> 02:03:54.848
[SPEAKER_03]: It's girls!

02:03:55.328 --> 02:03:55.849
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy!

02:06:53.135 --> 02:06:54.937
Thanks for watching!

02:07:34.321 --> 02:07:45.323
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so how appropriate that the last show at this studio will have Prodigy with Girls, the still shot mix this time in the cage match.

02:07:45.623 --> 02:07:47.123
[SPEAKER_07]: What did we think of the still shot mix?

02:07:47.483 --> 02:07:48.123
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura?

02:07:48.303 --> 02:07:52.144
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a mix of that song that doesn't completely suck donkey ass.

02:07:53.044 --> 02:07:54.965
[SPEAKER_15]: Which is double ass if you think about it.

02:07:56.125 --> 02:07:56.965
[SPEAKER_15]: So it gets an 8.

02:07:58.765 --> 02:07:59.045
[SPEAKER_07]: Get it?

02:07:59.065 --> 02:07:59.645
[SPEAKER_07]: Donkey ass?

02:07:59.745 --> 02:08:00.165
[SPEAKER_07]: Ass ass?

02:08:00.986 --> 02:08:01.986
[SPEAKER_07]: 8 from DarkSakura.

02:08:02.326 --> 02:08:02.646
[SPEAKER_07]: Jonas!

02:08:05.259 --> 02:08:06.220
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I was trying to go in the same order.

02:08:06.660 --> 02:08:12.305
[SPEAKER_28]: I have to agree, the remix is very great, so... I like the big beat into it, so I'll give it a 9.

02:08:12.465 --> 02:08:14.667
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, uh, Shark Skrull.

02:08:15.888 --> 02:08:18.229
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm feeling generous in that freaking own 10.

02:08:18.950 --> 02:08:19.871
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, Islander.

02:08:21.272 --> 02:08:22.293
[SPEAKER_26]: Don't I have a mouthful of cake?

02:08:22.313 --> 02:08:22.593
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll say 9.

02:08:24.735 --> 02:08:27.217
[SPEAKER_26]: Mel B. I was feeling that beat, man.

02:08:27.257 --> 02:08:33.762
[SPEAKER_26]: It's like a throwback to, like, the early 80s Afro-Bambada type, you know, hip-hop, like, old-school, like, breakbeat type stuff.

02:08:34.307 --> 02:08:36.908
[SPEAKER_26]: If I had more room here, I'd do a head spin, so I'd give it a nice 10.

02:08:38.289 --> 02:08:39.310
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Loki.

02:08:40.570 --> 02:08:44.732
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets a 9, and that belt gets a 10.

02:08:48.514 --> 02:08:50.395
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, and you know what?

02:08:50.535 --> 02:08:54.157
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate to be the party pooper, but I was only feeling that song for about the first minute.

02:08:54.357 --> 02:08:56.418
[SPEAKER_07]: And once the vocals came in, it kind of lost me.

02:08:56.519 --> 02:08:57.619
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can only really give it like a 6.5.

02:08:58.540 --> 02:08:58.780
[SPEAKER_07]: Angel.

02:08:59.720 --> 02:09:01.221
[SPEAKER_00]: For the beat, I'd give it a 7.

02:09:01.401 --> 02:09:01.681
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.

02:09:02.762 --> 02:09:03.142
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

02:09:03.894 --> 02:09:08.098
[SPEAKER_07]: Very tough decision tonight you guys, but here it is, the three songs you get to vote for.

02:09:08.558 --> 02:09:11.460
[SPEAKER_07]: Song number one, Yoko Kanno with Rise.

02:09:13.882 --> 02:09:15.303
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a bad clip, let me try another clip.

02:09:23.210 --> 02:09:27.934
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, song number two you can vote for tonight is Beck with Ghetto Chip Malfunction.

02:09:35.560 --> 02:09:40.561
[SPEAKER_07]: And song number three you can vote for tonight is Prodigy with Girls, the Still Shot Mix.

02:09:49.203 --> 02:09:51.384
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, place, vote.

02:09:58.254 --> 02:09:59.535
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry we had a bit of dead air there for a minute.

02:09:59.555 --> 02:09:59.995
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry about that.

02:10:00.035 --> 02:10:01.496
[SPEAKER_07]: Place vote now.

02:10:01.576 --> 02:10:03.997
[SPEAKER_07]: You must be in the chat room to place your vote.

02:10:08.579 --> 02:10:10.380
[SPEAKER_07]: Send a private message to Sky with your vote.

02:10:10.420 --> 02:10:11.601
[SPEAKER_07]: Song number one, Yoko Kanno.

02:10:11.661 --> 02:10:12.561
[SPEAKER_07]: Song number two, Beck.

02:10:12.641 --> 02:10:15.323
[SPEAKER_07]: Song number three, Prodigy.

02:10:15.563 --> 02:10:16.123
[SPEAKER_15]: My butt.

02:10:16.563 --> 02:10:17.664
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, Prodigy.

02:10:18.144 --> 02:10:18.404
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

02:10:20.763 --> 02:10:29.458
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, Loki, I know you've had kind of a dramatic week and a lot of stuff going on, but you know I have to ask, this is the point of the show where I always want to know, what's going on in the sim scene?

02:10:29.898 --> 02:10:31.681
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's a few things, actually.

02:10:33.382 --> 02:10:36.703
[SPEAKER_03]: There was XX Mix came out.

02:10:37.083 --> 02:10:39.583
[SPEAKER_03]: It's another Japanese fan mix type thing.

02:10:39.783 --> 02:10:40.323
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of cool.

02:10:40.363 --> 02:10:42.004
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got some pretty interesting songs in there.

02:10:42.324 --> 02:10:47.044
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a really good remix of 501, a really shitty remix of Celebrate Night, so it kind of evens out.

02:10:47.625 --> 02:10:57.546
[SPEAKER_03]: You can find a link for that on Bomae Style under the wonderful Japanese fan mix, like food mix thread, and that's in there.

02:10:57.566 --> 02:11:00.827
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also there was, oh man, what the...

02:11:01.280 --> 02:11:03.062
[SPEAKER_03]: Siberia Style 2.5 came out.

02:11:03.082 --> 02:11:04.544
[SPEAKER_03]: That's also Step Mania skin.

02:11:05.324 --> 02:11:06.686
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of resembles Techno Fiend.

02:11:06.726 --> 02:11:07.326
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty good.

02:11:07.607 --> 02:11:12.712
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't really noticed any differences between the 2.5 and 2, but I downloaded it anyways.

02:11:12.752 --> 02:11:13.213
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty good.

02:11:14.394 --> 02:11:15.275
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much it for now.

02:11:16.436 --> 02:11:17.838
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and DDRUK is back up.

02:11:19.179 --> 02:11:20.480
[SPEAKER_03]: But, eh, whatever.

02:11:23.907 --> 02:11:29.491
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, this is tough because I'm trying to tally votes from tonight's cage match here, so somebody's got to help me fill time.

02:11:30.492 --> 02:11:32.253
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, tell them about some of the other features.

02:11:32.273 --> 02:11:33.735
[SPEAKER_15]: I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts.

02:11:34.375 --> 02:11:39.519
[SPEAKER_15]: Tell them about some of the lovely... What am I supposed to tell people about?

02:11:39.579 --> 02:11:41.461
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the other lovely programming we have on Orange Laundry.

02:11:41.521 --> 02:11:43.142
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah, we do other shows.

02:11:43.202 --> 02:11:45.584
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we still do Diversion on Monday?

02:11:45.925 --> 02:11:46.345
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we are.

02:11:46.725 --> 02:11:50.048
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, there's Diversion on Monday, and it starts whenever the hell it feels like playing it.

02:11:50.861 --> 02:11:56.323
[SPEAKER_15]: And then on Tuesday, I do Pump Up the Volume, which is actually Gorilla's Marathon.

02:11:56.363 --> 02:11:56.663
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

02:11:57.443 --> 02:12:02.484
[SPEAKER_15]: Which is actually whatever I feel like playing at the time, or whatever the chat room requests.

02:12:02.544 --> 02:12:08.066
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really supposed to be a request show, but no one ever requests anything except for really bizarre shit I don't have.

02:12:09.326 --> 02:12:11.527
[SPEAKER_15]: Although I do have a bunch of bizarre stuff.

02:12:11.827 --> 02:12:17.109
[SPEAKER_15]: Pre-show starts at a quarter to seven, the show starts at 7.30 to 10.30, or whenever the hell I feel like passing out.

02:12:18.269 --> 02:12:18.369
[SPEAKER_15]: Um...

02:12:19.238 --> 02:12:22.660
[SPEAKER_15]: This Tuesday, by the way, I will not be doing the show on Tuesday.

02:12:23.380 --> 02:12:24.681
[SPEAKER_15]: I will be doing it another night.

02:12:25.621 --> 02:12:27.582
[SPEAKER_15]: Because my ass is taking a night off on my birthday.

02:12:27.662 --> 02:12:28.943
[SPEAKER_15]: So, fuck that.

02:12:30.744 --> 02:12:36.466
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you can check our Orange Lounge Live Journal community for the information on when the show will be rescheduled for.

02:12:36.486 --> 02:12:38.607
[SPEAKER_15]: Eh, responsible bullshit.

02:12:39.408 --> 02:12:42.389
[SPEAKER_15]: Next up is Rob's show, Outside the Box.

02:12:43.029 --> 02:12:46.231
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, but Outside the Box is actually on hiatus until the station relaunch in May.

02:12:46.391 --> 02:12:48.352
[SPEAKER_15]: So, it comes on eventually.

02:12:48.789 --> 02:12:49.450
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, eventually.

02:12:49.470 --> 02:12:50.590
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to look forward to that.

02:12:50.770 --> 02:12:55.694
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, maybe we'll have to make some type of arrangement.

02:12:55.774 --> 02:12:58.276
[SPEAKER_15]: I will be doing my show just on a different night.

02:12:59.577 --> 02:13:00.117
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

02:13:01.838 --> 02:13:04.780
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we do the repeat thingy.

02:13:06.262 --> 02:13:07.542
[SPEAKER_07]: On DDR Freak, actually.

02:13:07.562 --> 02:13:08.183
[SPEAKER_07]: That's indeed right.

02:13:08.203 --> 02:13:09.264
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to make a mention.

02:13:09.284 --> 02:13:09.604
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

02:13:10.609 --> 02:13:23.939
[SPEAKER_07]: and we actually have a lot of people that listen over on DDR Freak and so as kind of a thank you to you guys over on DDR Freak for making us kind of a popular little spin-off over on DDR Freak Radio, we actually now are on same week rotation.

02:13:24.439 --> 02:13:30.443
[SPEAKER_07]: So because of the fact that we didn't have a show last week, we used it as a chance to clean the gap there on DDR Freak.

02:13:30.463 --> 02:13:35.207
[SPEAKER_07]: So now you are hearing, when you hear this show, this is the show that we did that same Sunday.

02:13:35.247 --> 02:13:36.468
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to wait a week anymore.

02:13:36.528 --> 02:13:38.249
[SPEAKER_07]: You're actually getting the show the same week we did it.

02:13:38.369 --> 02:13:39.590
[SPEAKER_15]: And you'll be hearing it

02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:45.322
[SPEAKER_15]: in like full MP3 Pro quality.

02:13:45.362 --> 02:13:46.763
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, yes.

02:13:46.803 --> 02:13:50.485
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they have very good quality over there at DDR Freak Radio, so you get a good quality.

02:13:50.505 --> 02:13:54.227
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I'd say it's a pretty nice operation run over there.

02:13:54.307 --> 02:13:54.547
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

02:13:55.908 --> 02:13:58.189
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we have our new spin-off, Ferret Radio.

02:13:59.650 --> 02:14:09.495
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, when we relaunch in May and kind of things take over again, we're going to be kind of looking for new talent to do some new shows, so...

02:14:10.670 --> 02:14:13.731
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe we need to be doing Orange Lounge Idol.

02:14:14.431 --> 02:14:15.591
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so we'll see what happens.

02:14:16.391 --> 02:14:23.313
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want to be a part of the best of 2005 nominated Orange Lounge Radio, we're going to have opportunities coming up.

02:14:23.793 --> 02:14:25.533
[SPEAKER_07]: And it doesn't have to be about Bobani.

02:14:26.013 --> 02:14:29.554
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything gaming related in the slightest, we're going to take.

02:14:29.894 --> 02:14:31.815
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll have more details on that coming soon.

02:14:33.275 --> 02:14:37.736
[SPEAKER_15]: And don't forget about the Kick the Ultracade photobomb.

02:14:37.756 --> 02:14:38.656
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yes, we have that too.

02:14:39.275 --> 02:14:44.857
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, we need more pictures of people kicking Ultracade machines because those bids are trying to steal the MAME.

02:14:46.817 --> 02:14:50.238
[SPEAKER_07]: I think some of that got settled and that's not happening, but it's still funny.

02:14:50.758 --> 02:14:58.460
[SPEAKER_15]: The fact that the dude tried and he was such a complete retard because MAME was already registered and already somebody else's invention.

02:14:59.020 --> 02:15:04.362
[SPEAKER_15]: So yeah, kick an Ultracade machine out of Love for Orange Lounge and send me the picture.

02:15:05.859 --> 02:15:06.099
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

02:15:06.600 --> 02:15:06.920
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds good.

02:15:07.160 --> 02:15:10.243
[SPEAKER_07]: And only one person has voted for us on Podcast Alley tonight.

02:15:10.463 --> 02:15:14.606
[SPEAKER_07]: So I hope that maybe some of the rest of you guys are just waiting on those email confirmations.

02:15:15.087 --> 02:15:16.008
[SPEAKER_07]: They won't spam you.

02:15:16.208 --> 02:15:20.251
[SPEAKER_07]: There is completely nothing to vote for us over on Podcast Alley.

02:15:20.291 --> 02:15:20.792
[SPEAKER_07]: Please do.

02:15:21.132 --> 02:15:21.772
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd appreciate it.

02:15:23.033 --> 02:15:23.314
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

02:15:23.354 --> 02:15:23.774
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it.

02:15:23.794 --> 02:15:25.335
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys want to hear tonight's winner, the cage match?

02:15:25.936 --> 02:15:26.176
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

02:15:26.316 --> 02:15:26.596
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

02:15:26.797 --> 02:15:27.797
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, here's the interesting thing.

02:15:28.938 --> 02:15:32.321
[SPEAKER_07]: More votes tonight than any other cage match in Orange Lounge Radio history.

02:15:32.962 --> 02:15:33.102
[SPEAKER_24]: Ooh.

02:15:33.682 --> 02:15:41.246
[SPEAKER_07]: So this was now, and somebody in the chat room actually called me on it and said, Sky, you say it every week that the cage match is a hard one to decide.

02:15:41.546 --> 02:15:44.347
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight definitely is the case because of so many votes.

02:15:44.768 --> 02:15:47.069
[SPEAKER_07]: More votes tonight than any other night.

02:15:47.449 --> 02:15:48.329
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the winner?

02:15:52.631 --> 02:15:55.733
[SPEAKER_07]: Yoko Okano goes into retirement with a

02:15:56.357 --> 02:15:56.697
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm in history.

02:15:56.717 --> 02:15:58.119
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they said suck, see?

02:15:58.139 --> 02:15:59.039
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that necessarily a good thing?

02:16:20.932 --> 02:16:22.393
[SPEAKER_16]: It deserves to be retired!

02:16:45.349 --> 02:16:49.891
[SPEAKER_07]: and yeah, DarkSakura has now had one song retired with Yoko Kanno with Rise.

02:16:49.951 --> 02:16:55.174
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've all had one song retired and so when we come back on May 1st

02:16:56.440 --> 02:16:57.581
[SPEAKER_07]: Cage Match starts over.

02:16:57.701 --> 02:16:58.481
[SPEAKER_07]: Cage Match starts new.

02:16:58.601 --> 02:17:00.162
[SPEAKER_07]: Three brand new songs are going to be in it.

02:17:00.222 --> 02:17:01.163
[SPEAKER_07]: So it'll be interesting.

02:17:01.383 --> 02:17:02.784
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to have to change up the theme.

02:17:03.004 --> 02:17:03.784
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have to do something.

02:17:03.804 --> 02:17:05.285
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have to work on that over the next couple of weeks.

02:17:05.445 --> 02:17:06.206
[SPEAKER_07]: Change up the theme.

02:17:06.706 --> 02:17:14.450
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, and by the way, since I made a mention of this to Rob and Loki earlier, I do want to actually give a shout out to some of our listeners.

02:17:14.751 --> 02:17:16.572
[SPEAKER_15]: Those who are some of our UK listeners.

02:17:17.452 --> 02:17:17.632
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi.

02:17:18.833 --> 02:17:19.713
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, actually, I...

02:17:21.149 --> 02:17:21.849
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

02:17:39.943 --> 02:17:41.824
[SPEAKER_15]: We've gotten some listeners in Japan, too.

02:17:42.144 --> 02:17:44.825
[SPEAKER_07]: Japan is actually one of our biggest country representations.

02:17:44.845 --> 02:17:46.265
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe our third most listened country.

02:17:46.506 --> 02:17:47.866
[SPEAKER_07]: I think number three behind U.S.

02:17:47.886 --> 02:17:48.786
[SPEAKER_07]: and Canada, actually.

02:17:48.967 --> 02:17:52.668
[SPEAKER_07]: I think England itself is actually number four.

02:17:55.589 --> 02:18:07.954
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted to stop and make that mention to our listeners in non-United States countries, because even though we go off on everything happening over here, we're still thinking of you guys, so thank you for listening to us.

02:18:08.857 --> 02:18:09.578
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for watching!

02:18:29.662 --> 02:18:31.083
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's two choices we can do for that.

02:18:31.123 --> 02:18:38.387
[SPEAKER_07]: We can do A, the ultimate cage match with all the retired songs and choose a victor between all three of those retired songs.

02:18:38.547 --> 02:18:40.548
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, then it wouldn't be a surprise what you're going to hear.

02:18:41.569 --> 02:18:49.053
[SPEAKER_07]: Or choice number two, and the chat room has been begging us to do this for about 70 weeks now, reverse cage match number two.

02:18:49.954 --> 02:18:50.414
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think?

02:18:52.895 --> 02:18:57.378
[SPEAKER_15]: It would be good to end season four with the retirees.

02:18:57.518 --> 02:18:57.718
[SPEAKER_24]: Mm-hmm.

02:18:58.923 --> 02:19:00.644
[SPEAKER_15]: We have three retirees now, right?

02:19:00.684 --> 02:19:00.864
[SPEAKER_24]: Yep.

02:19:04.005 --> 02:19:05.726
[SPEAKER_15]: Why not do both?

02:19:06.206 --> 02:19:07.787
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we're going to do both next week.

02:19:07.827 --> 02:19:08.827
[SPEAKER_07]: So there'll be two cage matches.

02:19:08.847 --> 02:19:09.667
[SPEAKER_15]: Because we love you guys.

02:19:09.707 --> 02:19:12.469
[SPEAKER_15]: Double ultimate secret cage match.

02:19:12.489 --> 02:19:19.531
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll do the retirees to end season four, and we'll do the reverse cage match to start season five.

02:19:19.711 --> 02:19:22.072
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, this is season five that's ending right now.

02:19:22.112 --> 02:19:23.193
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it's season six.

02:19:23.553 --> 02:19:25.195
[SPEAKER_07]: The Season of Satan!

02:19:41.936 --> 02:19:48.298
[SPEAKER_07]: In the last reverse cage match, which took place on episode 69... Oh my god, if anyone plays girls, I will kill you.

02:19:49.138 --> 02:19:54.919
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Complicated from DanceMania Speed 9 was banned from the station forever.

02:19:55.760 --> 02:19:59.261
[SPEAKER_07]: So the speed mix of Complicated was banned from the station forever.

02:19:59.601 --> 02:20:00.321
[SPEAKER_07]: We will not play it.

02:20:00.381 --> 02:20:04.582
[SPEAKER_07]: So, both coming back next week.

02:20:04.662 --> 02:20:06.402
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be a two cage match week.

02:20:07.343 --> 02:20:08.583
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so look for that.

02:20:10.839 --> 02:20:11.219
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

02:20:11.619 --> 02:20:13.821
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we need to go to a break.

02:20:15.402 --> 02:20:16.322
[SPEAKER_15]: I need a break or something.

02:20:16.622 --> 02:20:17.363
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we need a break.

02:20:17.383 --> 02:20:21.385
[SPEAKER_07]: When we come back, we're going to have the FUs of the week and maybe a couple more Skype calls.

02:20:22.425 --> 02:20:23.206
[SPEAKER_07]: Ask Orange Lounge.

02:20:23.346 --> 02:20:25.027
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to do one more of those in the studio.

02:20:25.507 --> 02:20:28.149
[SPEAKER_07]: And whatever else we think of.

02:20:28.309 --> 02:20:30.310
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll be back after this.

02:20:30.870 --> 02:20:35.072
[SPEAKER_07]: In this break, what's a fun theme to do for this break?

02:20:38.154 --> 02:20:38.374
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

02:20:38.394 --> 02:20:39.515
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm digging through the old songs.

02:20:39.912 --> 02:20:42.414
[SPEAKER_03]: Just play Maximizer three times in a row or something like that.

02:20:42.434 --> 02:20:44.757
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we're not going to do Max.

02:20:45.277 --> 02:20:49.321
[SPEAKER_07]: But we can do songs that start with M. Let's do that.

02:20:49.341 --> 02:20:53.305
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to do songs that start with M. So we'll be back after this break.

02:20:53.726 --> 02:20:55.247
[SPEAKER_07]: Started off with some Matsuri Japan.

02:20:55.327 --> 02:20:56.128
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be back after this.

02:21:59.631 --> 02:22:01.038
Thanks for watching!

02:22:57.956 --> 02:22:58.376
[SPEAKER_10]: and many more.

02:23:45.268 --> 02:23:46.513
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

02:24:13.260 --> 02:24:14.804
Thanks for watching!

02:24:39.589 --> 02:24:42.210
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

02:25:44.754 --> 02:25:48.677
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:26:30.700 --> 02:26:34.762
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:27:05.248 --> 02:27:11.452
[SPEAKER_05]: Gaming Radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

02:27:13.933 --> 02:27:15.274
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio.

02:27:18.676 --> 02:27:21.617
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we are back here with Orange Lounge Radio.

02:27:22.357 --> 02:27:28.721
[SPEAKER_07]: Currently, radio dedicated to all things Bomani and then some, but in two weeks, what gamers really want to know.

02:27:29.835 --> 02:27:33.377
[SPEAKER_07]: The live show here, what we've got going on in this three-hour program, it's not going to really change.

02:27:33.437 --> 02:27:38.801
[SPEAKER_07]: We still are going to be the source, the premier internet radio source for DDR and other music and rhythm game news.

02:27:38.821 --> 02:27:40.542
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not going to change what we're doing Sunday nights.

02:27:40.882 --> 02:27:49.827
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just the change is going to affect the podcast, which has kind of already happened if you listened to this week's episode, and it also is going to affect the rest of what you hear on the station.

02:27:49.847 --> 02:27:51.908
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be looking for new shows to kind of expand.

02:27:52.289 --> 02:27:56.211
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to be the video gaming internet radio station.

02:27:56.611 --> 02:27:57.572
[SPEAKER_07]: The station.

02:27:58.152 --> 02:28:00.193
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're kind of excited about it, so we're looking forward to it.

02:28:01.353 --> 02:28:04.235
[SPEAKER_15]: We are going to have the biggest adjective ever.

02:28:05.355 --> 02:28:08.856
[SPEAKER_07]: And we know that the only way we're going to achieve this is with your guys' help.

02:28:09.857 --> 02:28:11.317
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we have an awesome listening base.

02:28:11.517 --> 02:28:17.780
[SPEAKER_07]: There is no way in hell we would ever have been nominated for the Best in Life 365 Awards without our listening base and all these other things we do.

02:28:18.080 --> 02:28:19.161
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys rock.

02:28:19.561 --> 02:28:20.161
[SPEAKER_07]: Love you guys.

02:28:21.081 --> 02:28:21.441
[SPEAKER_07]: Kisses.

02:28:21.742 --> 02:28:22.042
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

02:28:22.422 --> 02:28:27.604
[SPEAKER_07]: So, with that being said, let's go from the lovey-dovey chat to the angst and hatred.

02:28:29.102 --> 02:28:30.924
[SPEAKER_07]: chat that you guys have come to know and love.

02:28:32.765 --> 02:28:35.168
[SPEAKER_07]: And hopefully this won't be directed at the listeners tonight.

02:28:36.048 --> 02:28:37.590
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we might want to leave on a good note here.

02:28:37.670 --> 02:28:42.755
[SPEAKER_07]: So, DarkSakura, why is it that we always do these FUs of the week every single week?

02:28:43.035 --> 02:28:44.176
[SPEAKER_04]: Grr, argh.

02:29:01.974 --> 02:29:02.955
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

02:29:03.816 --> 02:29:08.799
[SPEAKER_15]: Big F you to people who drive 10 miles under the speed limit when I'm driving 20 over.

02:29:12.682 --> 02:29:19.807
[SPEAKER_15]: An F you to my driver's side window that keeps rolling down and the sap that fell all over my car windows in a sticky manner that has stayed put.

02:29:20.568 --> 02:29:23.910
[SPEAKER_15]: Little droplets all over my window.

02:29:23.930 --> 02:29:26.472
[SPEAKER_15]: F you to being...

02:29:27.324 --> 02:29:31.387
[SPEAKER_15]: Bored by just about everything since the semester is almost over.

02:29:32.248 --> 02:29:37.092
[SPEAKER_15]: School has gotten into the really boring yet really hectic phase where, Oh my god, I gotta get all this shit done!

02:29:38.033 --> 02:29:38.293
[SPEAKER_15]: You know.

02:29:39.434 --> 02:29:42.817
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, F you to my allergies and springtime in general.

02:29:44.578 --> 02:29:52.124
[SPEAKER_15]: And, uh, F you to, uh, living in my crappy apartment with my, uh, interesting neighbors.

02:29:53.205 --> 02:29:56.948
[SPEAKER_15]: And I mean, by interesting, I mean totally sucky.

02:30:00.521 --> 02:30:02.421
[SPEAKER_15]: No, my neighbors think they're all thug gangsters.

02:30:04.782 --> 02:30:05.042
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

02:30:08.082 --> 02:30:11.003
[SPEAKER_15]: And I mean the really wannabe thinking they are.

02:30:12.003 --> 02:30:12.983
[SPEAKER_15]: The really annoying kind.

02:30:14.023 --> 02:30:19.504
[SPEAKER_15]: If they really were, I'd think, oh, well, that's kind of awesome, but no.

02:30:19.944 --> 02:30:22.685
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, and I want to go back to Alabama.

02:30:22.705 --> 02:30:24.665
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I need grit.

02:30:26.265 --> 02:30:26.585
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm done.

02:30:28.606 --> 02:30:29.726
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Loki!

02:30:32.389 --> 02:30:34.991
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you to moving, I hate moving.

02:30:35.351 --> 02:30:36.752
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving sucks.

02:30:37.452 --> 02:30:41.435
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I mean, let's see, let's start off with people that drive slow.

02:30:41.975 --> 02:30:46.838
[SPEAKER_03]: Every single person, old person, person in a truck, always driving goddamn slow.

02:30:46.878 --> 02:30:51.721
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm doing, honestly, I'm doing like the speed limit because I don't want to go crazy with my car and stuff.

02:30:51.741 --> 02:30:56.743
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially when I've got a ton of, you know, boxes in and stuff I can't see out the back window or anything like that.

02:30:57.364 --> 02:30:59.365
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I've been doing pretty good, you know.

02:30:59.705 --> 02:31:01.026
[SPEAKER_03]: But these guys are going like...

02:31:02.363 --> 02:31:26.310
[SPEAKER_03]: 20, and a goddamn 50, okay, stuff like that, it's so awful, um, then, also, the fact that I have just so much crap to pack, that just really sucks, fuck you to my apartment for having a air conditioning unit right next to the bedroom, um, that sounds like a jet engine, you know, firing up, um, in the middle of the night when some bastard upstairs wants his air,

02:31:26.866 --> 02:31:33.868
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not that hot outside, and you just fucking turn on the air conditioning and it's just all... Oh my god!

02:31:34.848 --> 02:31:35.608
[SPEAKER_03]: Jet engine!

02:31:36.569 --> 02:31:46.611
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, I can sleep through that because I can sleep through anything, but, you know, my, you know, fiancé cannot, and she, you know, didn't like that too much.

02:31:48.372 --> 02:31:54.374
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, fuck you to the fact that my car's check engine light came on.

02:31:55.114 --> 02:31:55.514
[SPEAKER_03]: Why...

02:31:56.195 --> 02:31:57.255
[SPEAKER_03]: Why now?

02:31:57.575 --> 02:32:00.056
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially now that moving costs money.

02:32:01.176 --> 02:32:03.496
[SPEAKER_03]: Fixing a car is not exactly on the agenda.

02:32:04.917 --> 02:32:06.217
[SPEAKER_03]: Things are pretty tight as it is.

02:32:06.537 --> 02:32:09.538
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope nothing majorly wrong is with my car.

02:32:11.138 --> 02:32:14.919
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's something really bad, I can take it to the dealership and they'll fix it.

02:32:15.859 --> 02:32:18.799
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I've got that extended warranty that, thank God, I bought.

02:32:18.819 --> 02:32:21.660
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it's just...

02:32:22.099 --> 02:32:24.641
[SPEAKER_03]: We comprise our TV of solid lead and spent uranium

02:32:51.693 --> 02:32:55.615
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I don't understand why that TV's gotta be so damn heavy, but it is.

02:32:56.796 --> 02:32:58.937
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, um, let's see what else.

02:33:00.297 --> 02:33:07.701
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, fuck you, the, um, mutated, ugly, um, bitch next door that, um, rented me my U-Haul truck because, um,

02:33:08.669 --> 02:33:11.690
[SPEAKER_03]: I rented it online, you know, I reserved a 14-foot truck.

02:33:11.710 --> 02:33:16.791
[SPEAKER_03]: I get there, I've been trying to call you, and I couldn't get a hold of you.

02:33:17.132 --> 02:33:20.893
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I had, you know, I gave, you know, my work number and my home number.

02:33:21.153 --> 02:33:22.673
[SPEAKER_03]: I never heard a call over here.

02:33:22.853 --> 02:33:24.174
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I've been sitting here packing.

02:33:24.914 --> 02:33:28.035
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, we don't have a 14-foot truck.

02:33:28.115 --> 02:33:29.275
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to take 10.

02:33:29.955 --> 02:33:31.696
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, okay, fine, I'll take the 10-foot truck.

02:33:31.976 --> 02:33:33.476
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to be driving at night?

02:33:33.756 --> 02:33:35.477
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they don't got one headlight.

02:33:36.181 --> 02:33:38.922
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, okay, fine, I'll take the GIMP truck.

02:33:39.462 --> 02:33:41.723
[SPEAKER_03]: So then I take the GIMP truck, drive it around.

02:33:42.083 --> 02:33:45.585
[SPEAKER_03]: The fucking, um, you know, everything's breaking on this thing.

02:33:45.605 --> 02:33:50.787
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, oh my god, let's get this packed and done with, you know, before the truck falls apart.

02:33:51.067 --> 02:33:52.168
[SPEAKER_03]: We can get it back to her.

02:33:52.508 --> 02:33:55.269
[SPEAKER_03]: And honestly, we drove a total of seven miles.

02:33:56.302 --> 02:34:20.754
[SPEAKER_03]: 7 miles, the gas gauge is full, it's still on full, we get there, you only drove 7 miles, you probably didn't even fill it up, I'm charging you $3 for gas, for 7 miles, I mean, granted, I understand, you know, this might be like an SUV, but, you know, I don't think I used $7 for the gas driving 7 miles, or, you know, $3 for the gas, whatever it is, I mean, shit,

02:34:22.262 --> 02:34:28.226
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and not to mention that the truck cost me, um, $19.99 to start off with, $1.19 a mile.

02:34:28.546 --> 02:34:40.253
[SPEAKER_03]: $7 for the goddamn dolly, and then $5 for convenience fee for on- What the fuck, I got charged $5 for convenience fee online, not to get the same truck I want, instead I get a gimp truck.

02:34:40.493 --> 02:34:41.414
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck is that?

02:34:41.634 --> 02:34:46.016
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's Jamie when you need her, because she would be yelling at you, she would be filing a complaint for you right now.

02:34:47.477 --> 02:34:48.078
[SPEAKER_07]: Here she comes!

02:34:50.629 --> 02:34:52.330
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you to the chair for eating the microphone.

02:34:53.530 --> 02:34:54.211
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, what did I miss?

02:34:54.231 --> 02:34:55.151
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I was pulling my laundry.

02:34:56.072 --> 02:34:58.033
[SPEAKER_07]: Run by the bill again and why you got charged.

02:34:58.693 --> 02:35:03.215
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so ugly, you know, inbred bitch next door.

02:35:04.115 --> 02:35:15.901
[SPEAKER_03]: She, oh, might I add, she, for anyone that's out there that's seen Men in Black, okay, you know there's a point in the movie where this evil alien thing takes over a human host body and kind of

02:35:17.034 --> 02:35:20.537
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:35:43.519 --> 02:35:50.306
[SPEAKER_15]: Talk to your manager, write the Better Business Bureau, send a copy of the letter CCA to her, CCA, you know, send it to the Better Business Bureau, and keep a damn copy.

02:35:51.307 --> 02:35:57.132
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I love having her around, because she'll just, she'll tell you how to fuck with somebody.

02:35:59.114 --> 02:36:01.236
[SPEAKER_15]: I live to prove people wrong.

02:36:02.498 --> 02:36:06.622
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and then to top it off, at the very end of when I got done dealing with her,

02:36:07.469 --> 02:36:12.537
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know I need high schoolers that might want to work here on the weekend with me?

02:36:13.018 --> 02:36:17.486
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, no one that I would want to subject you to.

02:36:18.147 --> 02:36:19.289
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, that's all.

02:36:19.870 --> 02:36:20.591
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on.

02:36:26.292 --> 02:36:27.293
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they just keep getting worse.

02:36:28.393 --> 02:36:31.655
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I made this quick because I know we've got a lot of chat FUs and stuff.

02:36:32.035 --> 02:36:37.498
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to give a really quick FU to having to move because I hate packing stuff up and all that stuff.

02:36:37.978 --> 02:36:47.623
[SPEAKER_07]: And just an FU to Final Fantasy XI for pissing me off the past couple days and just having really bad parties.

02:36:48.364 --> 02:36:49.064
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's really all.

02:36:49.544 --> 02:36:50.445
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, I'm fine.

02:36:50.585 --> 02:36:50.845
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

02:36:51.245 --> 02:36:51.865
[SPEAKER_07]: Except for today.

02:36:51.905 --> 02:36:52.446
[SPEAKER_07]: Today was great.

02:36:53.848 --> 02:36:59.250
[SPEAKER_03]: Goddamn you fucking link shell members and doing your fucking, you know, JSA stuff.

02:36:59.550 --> 02:37:01.111
[SPEAKER_03]: I fucking, or JSE stuff.

02:37:01.691 --> 02:37:06.713
[SPEAKER_03]: Goddamn you people and your artifact armor not helping me out but doing everybody else's in the link shell.

02:37:07.073 --> 02:37:08.394
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna hunt you down and kill you.

02:37:08.734 --> 02:37:11.335
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's move on to the in-studio FUs.

02:37:11.375 --> 02:37:12.655
[SPEAKER_07]: Guys, please keep them short tonight.

02:37:12.675 --> 02:37:13.415
[SPEAKER_07]: We're running out of time.

02:37:13.576 --> 02:37:13.836
[SPEAKER_07]: Angel.

02:37:15.376 --> 02:37:22.439
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, FU to the stupid radio stations has decided to take over the bowling alley in which I decided to play DDR every week.

02:37:23.510 --> 02:37:24.330
[SPEAKER_00]: Mmm, yeah.

02:37:25.771 --> 02:37:30.212
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, because they stopped us at the door and they were like, you need to pay 50 bucks to get in.

02:37:30.252 --> 02:37:30.892
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, huh?

02:37:31.912 --> 02:37:33.493
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to pay 50 bucks to get in.

02:37:33.553 --> 02:37:36.614
[SPEAKER_00]: Please turn around and leave if you're not gonna... And I'm like, huh?

02:37:36.814 --> 02:37:37.114
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

02:37:37.274 --> 02:37:37.554
[SPEAKER_00]: Who?

02:37:37.954 --> 02:37:47.757
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, uh, I didn't... So, um, I was just like, whatever.

02:37:47.997 --> 02:37:50.998
[SPEAKER_15]: So we turn around and leave and, like, went to go play DDR somewhere else.

02:37:51.570 --> 02:37:57.052
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm not telling you where, at least on the air, because that's just an embarrassment even to me.

02:37:57.732 --> 02:38:11.998
[SPEAKER_00]: But I found out later through Lab Journal that the only reason that they were charging $50 to get into the place was the fact that they had some basketball player there that was signing autographs.

02:38:12.638 --> 02:38:14.539
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going, the hell?

02:38:14.919 --> 02:38:16.560
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, whatever.

02:38:17.556 --> 02:38:27.508
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to go on about how that's weird, because I'm like, what, are the League people going to have to pay $50 too?

02:38:28.630 --> 02:38:30.732
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't answer that.

02:38:30.752 --> 02:38:37.300
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel that person that MPK'd us, because that sucks on Final Fantasy XI, you don't just leave like, you know,

02:38:38.707 --> 02:38:42.669
[SPEAKER_00]: 3, no, 4 monsters that are like way beyond a party's level and then just teleport out.

02:38:42.709 --> 02:38:43.429
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, what the?

02:38:43.809 --> 02:38:44.730
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, great, we're dead.

02:38:46.931 --> 02:38:47.451
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, bye.

02:38:48.551 --> 02:38:48.851
[SPEAKER_05]: Mal.

02:38:49.892 --> 02:38:50.732
[SPEAKER_26]: Uh, keep them quick.

02:38:51.352 --> 02:38:53.353
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, F you to the gas prices right now.

02:38:53.373 --> 02:38:56.555
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm having to pay at least $2.60 for a gallon.

02:38:56.635 --> 02:39:02.337
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, up in Sacto, I saw like $2.53 for the cheapest unleaded and I thought, wow, that is cheap.

02:39:03.988 --> 02:39:07.850
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, meanwhile, back in my, you know, neck of the woods, it's like, it's in the mid-260s.

02:39:07.890 --> 02:39:09.151
[SPEAKER_27]: That's just gotta go, man.

02:39:10.751 --> 02:39:17.435
[SPEAKER_27]: And, um, I guess the other F you would be to, uh, ugly chicks who wear those shirts that say hottie or cutie or something.

02:39:17.575 --> 02:39:21.838
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know, I mean, look, I ain't trying to hate or nothing.

02:39:22.078 --> 02:39:24.439
[SPEAKER_27]: I know, you know, beauty is cutie and all that kind of good stuff.

02:39:24.519 --> 02:39:28.381
[SPEAKER_27]: It's like, I can understand if you wear a shirt that says, like, angel or princess.

02:39:28.441 --> 02:39:31.683
[SPEAKER_27]: I know you're somebody's, you know, little toy, but you know what?

02:39:32.527 --> 02:39:35.348
[SPEAKER_27]: I just, you know, a word of, just, you know, a little rule of thumb.

02:39:35.808 --> 02:39:39.149
[SPEAKER_27]: If your shirt is 4XL, you do not deserve to wear cutie on it.

02:39:41.849 --> 02:39:42.850
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, Shark's Girl.

02:39:44.370 --> 02:39:48.451
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm very mellow, so I don't really have anything, which is unusual for me.

02:39:49.031 --> 02:39:49.852
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm just quiet.

02:39:50.472 --> 02:39:51.232
[SPEAKER_16]: Yay, happy.

02:39:51.652 --> 02:39:53.132
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, F you not being angsty.

02:39:53.613 --> 02:39:54.333
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, F you.

02:39:54.413 --> 02:39:55.133
[SPEAKER_16]: There you go.

02:39:55.233 --> 02:39:55.953
[SPEAKER_16]: Now you happy?

02:39:56.293 --> 02:39:56.933
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, very.

02:39:57.053 --> 02:39:57.313
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

02:39:57.994 --> 02:39:58.414
[SPEAKER_07]: Islander.

02:39:59.214 --> 02:39:59.294
[SPEAKER_36]: Uh,

02:40:00.069 --> 02:40:08.914
[SPEAKER_36]: Just F you to EA Sports Online because I refuse to play my favorite game, my NBA Live, until the rosters are updated from all the major stuff that went down two months ago.

02:40:11.856 --> 02:40:13.297
[SPEAKER_28]: Explicit.

02:40:16.359 --> 02:40:19.481
[SPEAKER_28]: I want to give an F you to the Cheesecake Factor for charging me $420 on the whole meal.

02:40:19.501 --> 02:40:19.481
$420!

02:40:19.521 --> 02:40:20.962
[SPEAKER_28]: $420!

02:40:19.581 --> 02:40:20.962
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see, there's 32 people.

02:40:30.720 --> 02:40:36.921
[SPEAKER_06]: After counting... Okay, including the... Damn, that's a lot of cheesecake.

02:40:36.981 --> 02:40:39.802
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to need one of those 4XL cutie shirts after that.

02:40:43.503 --> 02:40:44.263
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, okay, okay.

02:40:44.683 --> 02:40:55.125
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyways, in a serious note, I understand that $60 went to the gratuity and $30 went to tax, but how the hell were we fucking $160 deficits?

02:40:56.066 --> 02:40:57.246
[SPEAKER_28]: Someone didn't pay for their meal and...

02:40:57.802 --> 02:41:02.023
[SPEAKER_28]: If I find out who the hell did not pay for their meals, I'm going to be pissed off and beat the living shit out of them.

02:41:02.944 --> 02:41:05.824
[SPEAKER_28]: I know that 32 people came in, but I know someone's lying on paying their meals.

02:41:06.885 --> 02:41:07.225
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

02:41:08.445 --> 02:41:15.247
[SPEAKER_28]: If it is one girl who bitch slapped me because she thinks I poked her with my penis on the bed... What?

02:41:17.428 --> 02:41:19.168
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, slow down, buddy.

02:41:19.208 --> 02:41:19.448
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

02:41:20.189 --> 02:41:20.529
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

02:41:20.929 --> 02:41:21.529
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to give you...

02:41:23.088 --> 02:41:24.789
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, make it quick, we gotta wrap this up.

02:41:24.809 --> 02:41:32.895
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, I have to go through this one girl who bitch slapped me because she thought I poked her with a penis on her butt cheek.

02:41:35.097 --> 02:41:36.117
[SPEAKER_06]: But you don't get boners.

02:41:38.659 --> 02:41:41.401
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, first of all, that was a point, that was a racket.

02:41:42.442 --> 02:41:44.063
[SPEAKER_28]: That was a pointy part of the racket.

02:41:44.123 --> 02:41:46.825
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a flat, it's not round, it's not warm.

02:41:46.885 --> 02:41:48.586
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that what the kids are calling it these days?

02:41:49.944 --> 02:41:52.486
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's just, you want to see my pointy part of the racket?

02:41:52.787 --> 02:41:54.228
[SPEAKER_03]: You weren't just happy to see her, right?

02:41:54.368 --> 02:41:57.090
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, how are you around poking people with their penis anyways?

02:41:57.171 --> 02:42:00.073
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, it was a Reddit place, how do you know who that girl is?

02:42:02.896 --> 02:42:08.721
[SPEAKER_28]: F you to all this drama ruckus all over DDR, goddammit, pick your goddamn people wisely.

02:42:08.861 --> 02:42:12.804
[SPEAKER_28]: Don't say, ooh, I love this person, I love this, but I feel happiness for this.

02:42:13.305 --> 02:42:16.908
[SPEAKER_28]: Blah, blah, blah, you're picking your drama all over me, saying I'm supposed to be

02:42:17.942 --> 02:42:19.022
[SPEAKER_28]: The God of Relationships.

02:42:19.383 --> 02:42:22.924
[SPEAKER_28]: I can't solve everyone's relationships each and every fucking time.

02:42:25.664 --> 02:42:26.665
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, do be continued.

02:42:27.085 --> 02:42:27.705
[SPEAKER_15]: But I can.

02:42:27.745 --> 02:42:28.705
[SPEAKER_15]: It's called cyanide.

02:42:29.105 --> 02:42:31.306
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, one quick one before we get chatroom interviews.

02:42:32.727 --> 02:42:33.887
[SPEAKER_15]: I forgot what it was.

02:42:34.187 --> 02:42:35.247
[SPEAKER_07]: Remind us later.

02:42:35.287 --> 02:42:35.567
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

02:42:36.028 --> 02:42:38.188
[SPEAKER_07]: Guys, if they're long, they're getting cut short tonight.

02:42:38.228 --> 02:42:38.488
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

02:42:39.309 --> 02:42:39.769
[SPEAKER_07]: Ram.

02:42:40.569 --> 02:42:41.569
[SPEAKER_07]: R-H-A-Y-A-M.

02:42:41.609 --> 02:42:42.289
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's Ram.

02:42:43.590 --> 02:42:43.990
[SPEAKER_07]: I could have.

02:42:44.434 --> 02:42:47.957
[SPEAKER_07]: Sworn, I had this problem last week, or I wasn't sure how to pronounce this, but I think it's Ram.

02:42:48.677 --> 02:42:52.880
[SPEAKER_07]: Says, F you to freaking long winter that wreak havoc with my sinuses.

02:42:54.582 --> 02:42:59.625
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100Matt says, F you to my tire blowing out at the worst time possible on the highway.

02:42:59.886 --> 02:43:00.046
[SPEAKER_07]: Ouch.

02:43:00.706 --> 02:43:02.428
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to the Yankees losing streak.

02:43:02.528 --> 02:43:03.068
[SPEAKER_07]: Go Yanks.

02:43:04.489 --> 02:43:10.634
[SPEAKER_07]: LemonLimeJump says, F you to my interweb connection crapping out on me so I couldn't listen to Pump Up the Volume on Tuesday night.

02:43:11.975 --> 02:43:12.295
[SPEAKER_00]: Sniff.

02:43:12.921 --> 02:43:15.702
[SPEAKER_07]: Elmullet says, F you to company and console fanboys.

02:43:16.003 --> 02:43:19.724
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't you have fun with your games and systems without sucking out the enjoyment of others?

02:43:20.045 --> 02:43:23.366
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking at you, Sony fanboys, and you too, Nintendo fanboys.

02:43:24.447 --> 02:43:25.687
[SPEAKER_07]: How about both systems suck?

02:43:26.348 --> 02:43:27.088
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I be on that side?

02:43:27.128 --> 02:43:27.588
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding.

02:43:27.708 --> 02:43:28.769
[SPEAKER_07]: They're actually both really good.

02:43:29.069 --> 02:43:29.990
[SPEAKER_07]: In their own special way.

02:43:30.810 --> 02:43:34.592
[SPEAKER_07]: Blarg says, F you to getting banned from a bar for sneaking in booze.

02:43:37.108 --> 02:43:39.851
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you do know the purpose of a bar, right?

02:43:40.051 --> 02:43:41.092
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, whatever.

02:43:41.632 --> 02:43:46.757
[SPEAKER_07]: He also says, F you to getting banned from 4chan.

02:43:49.900 --> 02:43:58.649
[SPEAKER_07]: Fireboma says, my F you is to the assholes at EB Games for selling out of PSPs too quickly and then not getting another shipment in for another couple of weeks.

02:43:59.679 --> 02:44:01.081
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but they hardly control that.

02:44:01.561 --> 02:44:06.466
[SPEAKER_07]: Illusion says F you to not being able to go to the bowling alley on Friday because Larry was busy ice skating.

02:44:06.666 --> 02:44:07.267
[SPEAKER_07]: Ice skating!

02:44:07.868 --> 02:44:08.288
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

02:44:09.469 --> 02:44:17.898
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to hardly anyone showing up for karaoke on Saturday night and F you to myself for coming up with such lame-ass F yous to be on the last episode in that studio.

02:44:17.978 --> 02:44:18.359
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't worry.

02:44:19.200 --> 02:44:20.161
[SPEAKER_07]: We are starting over.

02:44:21.149 --> 02:44:27.975
[SPEAKER_07]: Toshin says F you to cheap arcade owners who can buy a 12K gun game but not a 2DX machine.

02:44:28.475 --> 02:44:30.517
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm, sounds like what happened at Scandia.

02:44:34.139 --> 02:44:37.162
[SPEAKER_07]: Dork says F you to my English teacher for being totally anal.

02:44:37.542 --> 02:44:43.167
[SPEAKER_07]: If the paper is good and the content is good, why the hell are you going to put an F on my paper for a stupid title?

02:44:44.817 --> 02:44:47.779
[SPEAKER_07]: MPQ says, I just took up 2DX and I have one FU.

02:44:47.919 --> 02:44:52.782
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck the Safari, fuck Stoic, and fuck all the 2DX bullshit running through those songs.

02:44:52.842 --> 02:44:54.082
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to like those songs, too.

02:44:55.503 --> 02:44:57.884
[SPEAKER_07]: That got a nice big word from our studio there.

02:44:59.025 --> 02:45:03.407
[SPEAKER_07]: LXLDubes says, my FU also goes to fake thug gangstas.

02:45:03.868 --> 02:45:09.831
[SPEAKER_07]: The next time I see a nerd white boy walking in my school with shorts down to his ankles, I'm gonna commit suicide.

02:45:10.871 --> 02:45:15.133
[SPEAKER_07]: Another FU to Sin City for making me stay up until 2 in the morning at Muviko?

02:45:15.413 --> 02:45:16.374
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry if I mispronounced that.

02:45:17.114 --> 02:45:21.056
[SPEAKER_07]: I played a game of DDR in their arcade after the movie and almost fell asleep while playing.

02:45:21.637 --> 02:45:23.918
[SPEAKER_07]: FU to parents for not believing me when I tell the truth.

02:45:24.418 --> 02:45:26.479
[SPEAKER_07]: FU to myself for sucking at life so bad.

02:45:26.559 --> 02:45:30.021
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and another FU to staying home alone, because I can't think of any better FUs.

02:45:31.822 --> 02:45:39.105
[SPEAKER_07]: Legend of Zaku says, FU to New York State University Police for being the pigs that they are by holding the students down when they want to make noise at 3 a.m.

02:45:39.125 --> 02:45:39.766
[SPEAKER_07]: in the morning.

02:45:42.102 --> 02:45:43.563
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't you know people are trying to study?

02:45:45.664 --> 02:45:49.007
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to still not being able to buy a Konami 2DX controller for hella cheap.

02:45:49.187 --> 02:45:54.891
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to my lame ass, ant infested, beater of an apartment that I was sent to this year by my campus.

02:45:56.652 --> 02:46:01.315
[SPEAKER_07]: Dark Knight says my F you for this week goes to work for being such evil ass hats.

02:46:01.775 --> 02:46:04.257
[SPEAKER_07]: And an F you to me for being a broke ass negro.

02:46:05.118 --> 02:46:05.698
[SPEAKER_07]: That's his words.

02:46:06.579 --> 02:46:08.520
[SPEAKER_07]: DDArchaholic, last one.

02:46:09.494 --> 02:46:13.015
[SPEAKER_07]: Daniel, D-Arcoholics passing along one for Daniel.

02:46:13.375 --> 02:46:16.936
[SPEAKER_07]: Daniel says, F you to my ex-wife for making my life a living hell.

02:46:17.476 --> 02:46:20.617
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's a good one to end the F you segment on.

02:46:20.757 --> 02:46:21.357
[SPEAKER_07]: Two more.

02:46:21.897 --> 02:46:22.677
[SPEAKER_28]: Two really quick ones.

02:46:23.517 --> 02:46:23.858
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright.

02:46:23.878 --> 02:46:24.178
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

02:46:24.558 --> 02:46:29.439
[SPEAKER_28]: And F you goes to taxes for being a bitch for not sending me my refunds yet.

02:46:30.119 --> 02:46:32.720
[SPEAKER_28]: I filed my taxes like two months ago and still haven't got my refund.

02:46:33.880 --> 02:46:34.700
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, I'll check that out.

02:46:35.280 --> 02:46:37.261
[SPEAKER_28]: And F you did his dog for pissing on my tires.

02:46:37.381 --> 02:46:37.581
[SPEAKER_28]: This is...

02:46:40.492 --> 02:46:47.195
[SPEAKER_15]: I have no pity for the people who haven't gotten their tax money yet.

02:46:47.215 --> 02:46:52.797
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, Jonas, because I did mine like three months ago, and I got my money two months ago.

02:46:54.418 --> 02:46:58.940
[SPEAKER_15]: If you hop on it right when you get it and tele-file, you get your money awfully fast.

02:47:08.310 --> 02:47:11.592
[SPEAKER_36]: I would also like to say that I now have no credit, we have no credit card debt.

02:47:37.797 --> 02:47:38.738
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm so happy.

02:47:41.800 --> 02:47:42.400
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, guys.

02:47:42.560 --> 02:47:45.842
[SPEAKER_03]: I could have had a larger refund if fucking golf lane had fucked me over.

02:47:48.604 --> 02:47:48.924
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

02:47:50.225 --> 02:47:52.006
[SPEAKER_07]: Ten more minutes left in the show, you guys.

02:47:52.366 --> 02:47:57.609
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's kind of the end of the season, the end of a big chapter here in the Orange Lounge radio book.

02:47:58.070 --> 02:47:59.931
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, you know, we've got a little bit of time left.

02:47:59.971 --> 02:48:03.113
[SPEAKER_07]: And what do we always do when we have a little time left at the end of the show?

02:48:04.173 --> 02:48:06.495
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's ask the Orange Lounge a question.

02:48:10.879 --> 02:48:12.600
[SPEAKER_24]: Can I ax you a question?

02:48:12.901 --> 02:48:15.923
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's ax Orange Lounge some stupid question.

02:48:16.384 --> 02:48:19.606
[SPEAKER_07]: What will we find out tonight on Orange Lounge Radio?

02:48:19.967 --> 02:48:23.389
[SPEAKER_07]: Will they ax about the studio since last week we are here?

02:48:23.710 --> 02:48:27.132
[SPEAKER_07]: Or will they ax a question about the new place where we're gonna be?

02:48:27.273 --> 02:48:28.774
[SPEAKER_07]: Or will they ax something else?

02:48:33.257 --> 02:48:36.180
[SPEAKER_14]: Excuse me, I want to ax you a few questions.

02:48:37.964 --> 02:48:50.570
[SPEAKER_07]: L. Mullet, assuming Orange Lounge, the band, ever sued you and made you change your name, what would you call your station in its place?

02:48:51.390 --> 02:48:56.513
[SPEAKER_15]: I've researched that they can't sue us, ha ha ha, because it's not registered in the United States.

02:48:56.533 --> 02:48:57.493
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it'll never happen.

02:48:57.513 --> 02:48:59.234
[SPEAKER_07]: He says, yes, it'll never happen, but what if?

02:49:00.168 --> 02:49:03.469
[SPEAKER_03]: Purple Lounge Radio I was thinking after the store that Dan owned, Game On

02:49:24.136 --> 02:49:25.237
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be a good one, too.

02:49:25.297 --> 02:49:29.121
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't really ever sat down and talked about this, but Jamie actually... Jamie's gonna kick your ass!

02:49:29.181 --> 02:49:34.465
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie researched a trademark, and since Orange Lounge actually isn't trademarked in the U.S., we can have it.

02:49:34.605 --> 02:49:37.508
[SPEAKER_07]: But Konami knows what we're doing, and they don't care.

02:49:37.848 --> 02:49:41.011
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll do what Kentucky Fried Chicken does and just call ourselves OLR.

02:49:41.952 --> 02:49:44.694
[SPEAKER_07]: That's possible as well, so... Alright, anyway.

02:49:45.895 --> 02:49:46.296
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see...

02:49:49.987 --> 02:49:51.868
[SPEAKER_07]: They're giving us all these Spanish names in the chatroom.

02:49:51.888 --> 02:49:52.849
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what that is about.

02:49:53.009 --> 02:49:53.990
[SPEAKER_15]: El Pantalon.

02:49:54.590 --> 02:49:58.773
[SPEAKER_07]: Fireboma says, how many licks does it take to get to the center of Loki's pants?

02:50:01.996 --> 02:50:07.080
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, hey, you know, when there's a giant gaping hole in them, one.

02:50:08.741 --> 02:50:10.562
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not a question you need to be asking us.

02:50:10.602 --> 02:50:11.323
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, honestly.

02:50:11.843 --> 02:50:15.806
[SPEAKER_07]: We will give you his girlfriend's email address, and you can just ask her directly.

02:50:16.227 --> 02:50:17.868
[SPEAKER_07]: Why you want to know this, I don't know.

02:50:20.154 --> 02:50:20.994
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Morpheus

02:50:49.713 --> 02:50:50.054
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed.

02:50:50.715 --> 02:50:51.716
[SPEAKER_00]: See, Travis?

02:50:52.056 --> 02:50:53.338
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't bullshit me anymore.

02:50:53.538 --> 02:50:54.800
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, uh, yeah.

02:50:55.041 --> 02:50:56.242
[SPEAKER_00]: I just gave you a shout-out, so there, bye.

02:50:57.865 --> 02:50:58.145
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

02:50:59.206 --> 02:51:00.729
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, LXLDubes.

02:51:02.193 --> 02:51:05.074
[SPEAKER_07]: Why does everyone hate Stoic, Safari, etc.

02:51:05.194 --> 02:51:06.535
[SPEAKER_07]: after the new 2DX?

02:51:06.675 --> 02:51:08.656
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't hate Stoic, it's Taku.

02:51:08.856 --> 02:51:11.217
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, I don't really follow 2DX.

02:51:11.377 --> 02:51:14.559
[SPEAKER_27]: The Safari was never meant to be 150 BPM, that's why.

02:51:14.619 --> 02:51:18.841
[SPEAKER_07]: That is actually a big reason why people have a beef with the Safari and the song Get On Beat.

02:51:19.121 --> 02:51:23.823
[SPEAKER_07]: When they originally appeared in 3rd and 4th style respectively, they were about 40 BPM.

02:51:24.523 --> 02:51:25.724
[SPEAKER_07]: About 130-ish.

02:51:25.864 --> 02:51:29.946
[SPEAKER_14]: I've come close to actually beating them, and now I can't and never will.

02:51:30.266 --> 02:51:39.571
[SPEAKER_07]: For some reason, and we have no idea why, but when 6th style came out, they sped them up to 160 BPM, and speeding up a song makes it harder in 2DX.

02:51:39.611 --> 02:51:42.752
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to hit more keys in a minute, it just automatically makes the song harder.

02:51:43.072 --> 02:51:48.435
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, there was another I was playing in 9th style the other day, the another is just the same damn song sped up.

02:51:49.329 --> 02:51:49.849
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crazy.

02:51:50.630 --> 02:51:51.650
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't even remember what it was, though.

02:51:51.670 --> 02:51:53.271
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's Distress, I want to say.

02:51:53.351 --> 02:51:54.271
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's Distress, another.

02:51:54.371 --> 02:51:54.952
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just sped up.

02:51:55.592 --> 02:52:01.295
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that there was one, I don't remember what it was, that had freezes in it, or where it stopped.

02:52:01.795 --> 02:52:04.496
[SPEAKER_15]: But in the another, it speeds up or something.

02:52:04.817 --> 02:52:05.617
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't remember what song it was.

02:52:05.677 --> 02:52:06.597
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it was on 4th style.

02:52:07.558 --> 02:52:08.598
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I know what you're talking about.

02:52:08.638 --> 02:52:09.039
[SPEAKER_07]: Get On Beat?

02:52:09.399 --> 02:52:10.459
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it wasn't Get On Beat.

02:52:10.479 --> 02:52:11.640
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Checking You Out.

02:52:12.020 --> 02:52:12.800
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Taku?

02:52:13.321 --> 02:52:16.002
[SPEAKER_07]: Checking You Out was faster on... But it did it both ways.

02:52:17.142 --> 02:52:17.463
[SPEAKER_15]: It was...

02:52:19.418 --> 02:52:20.159
[SPEAKER_15]: Radical Faith?

02:52:21.140 --> 02:52:22.041
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it was Radical Faith.

02:52:22.081 --> 02:52:24.524
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought it was one of the Tucker songs.

02:52:25.385 --> 02:52:25.645
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

02:52:26.206 --> 02:52:27.947
[SPEAKER_07]: MPQ has a suggestion in our chatroom.

02:52:27.967 --> 02:52:31.111
[SPEAKER_07]: He says they hate them because the note charts are total bullshit!

02:52:33.144 --> 02:52:33.685
[SPEAKER_07]: and Hal.

02:52:34.045 --> 02:52:36.767
[SPEAKER_15]: But I actually like the Safari, the song.

02:52:37.267 --> 02:52:38.488
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, the songs are great.

02:52:38.548 --> 02:52:39.769
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, 2DX songs are sexy.

02:52:39.789 --> 02:52:47.476
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Get On Beat Wildstyle makes me want to barf up, but... Although, sadly, I think like 5th, 6th, 7th for me was about the peak of 2DX music.

02:52:47.596 --> 02:52:48.737
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't been so into new ones.

02:52:48.997 --> 02:52:50.058
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's good stuff, though.

02:52:50.478 --> 02:52:52.700
[SPEAKER_15]: I miss the 4th style booty dancers.

02:52:53.981 --> 02:52:56.022
[SPEAKER_15]: We need more 4th style booty dancers.

02:52:57.183 --> 02:53:00.266
[SPEAKER_15]: We need the chick in the bandana to come back and we need that weird looking guy.

02:53:01.229 --> 02:53:07.251
[SPEAKER_07]: LXL Doobs also is asking, why didn't anybody have sex with the blow-up lamb that Jonas brought tonight?

02:53:08.151 --> 02:53:09.952
[SPEAKER_15]: Because... Islanders going for it.

02:53:10.032 --> 02:53:10.792
[SPEAKER_07]: Islanders going for it.

02:53:12.193 --> 02:53:14.654
[SPEAKER_15]: Because some of us don't need to fake it.

02:53:14.694 --> 02:53:15.854
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of us get it for real.

02:53:16.674 --> 02:53:17.615
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh!

02:53:17.855 --> 02:53:18.455
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh!

02:53:19.675 --> 02:53:20.876
[SPEAKER_07]: You can quote her on that one.

02:53:20.896 --> 02:53:21.836
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Islanders leaving.

02:53:22.616 --> 02:53:23.797
[SPEAKER_27]: Officially violated.

02:53:24.117 --> 02:53:24.617
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

02:53:27.458 --> 02:53:27.858
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

02:53:31.189 --> 02:53:36.752
[SPEAKER_07]: You can still buy Pineapple Crush in the ghetto.

02:53:57.555 --> 02:53:59.036
[SPEAKER_15]: Go down to Del Paso.

02:53:59.096 --> 02:54:01.657
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to go because I miss Pineapple Crush.

02:54:01.677 --> 02:54:02.177
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the best.

02:54:02.497 --> 02:54:03.578
[SPEAKER_07]: I do still like Pineapple Crush.

02:54:04.058 --> 02:54:05.439
[SPEAKER_07]: She says her favorite is Melon Soda.

02:54:05.719 --> 02:54:08.881
[SPEAKER_07]: I am developing a fond likeness for Chocolate Soda, though.

02:54:09.161 --> 02:54:09.541
[SPEAKER_15]: Ramune.

02:54:10.609 --> 02:54:11.310
[SPEAKER_07]: www.DarkSakura.com

02:54:27.706 --> 02:54:29.808
[SPEAKER_07]: about two years ago now.

02:54:29.848 --> 02:54:30.329
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a while.

02:54:30.369 --> 02:54:31.269
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn, it's really been that long.

02:54:31.309 --> 02:54:32.691
[SPEAKER_07]: It was about two years ago I gave up soda.

02:54:33.571 --> 02:54:35.653
[SPEAKER_07]: So pineapple's the only thing that would get me to drink regular soda.

02:54:35.693 --> 02:54:36.894
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, I stick with pretty much diets.

02:54:37.675 --> 02:54:40.657
[SPEAKER_07]: Diet cream soda is the best, though, because it tastes like regular cream soda.

02:54:40.677 --> 02:54:41.078
[SPEAKER_07]: It really does.

02:54:41.198 --> 02:54:42.299
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what I should do one day?

02:54:42.979 --> 02:54:50.986
[SPEAKER_15]: Get some pineapple sugar-free Torani and some half-and-half and some soda water and make pineapple Italian cream soda.

02:54:51.246 --> 02:54:51.807
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love you.

02:54:52.608 --> 02:54:53.048
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love you.

02:54:53.587 --> 02:54:55.688
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we got, oh, we only got a little bit of show left.

02:54:55.708 --> 02:54:57.349
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to make sure we get some of these other questions here.

02:54:57.910 --> 02:54:59.771
[SPEAKER_07]: Illusion, I think this is a good one here.

02:55:00.712 --> 02:55:03.774
[SPEAKER_07]: What is your favorite memory of all time in this studio?

02:55:06.195 --> 02:55:06.695
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll start.

02:55:07.736 --> 02:55:10.218
[SPEAKER_07]: The night we got Karaoke Revolution and played it on air.

02:55:12.259 --> 02:55:13.900
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, that was some funny shit.

02:55:13.980 --> 02:55:14.480
[SPEAKER_07]: It really was.

02:55:15.021 --> 02:55:16.982
[SPEAKER_07]: Favorite memory, yeah, Loki sighing.

02:55:17.856 --> 02:55:19.178
[SPEAKER_07]: Favorite memory in the studio?

02:55:19.218 --> 02:55:19.798
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody else have one?

02:55:20.098 --> 02:55:25.084
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I would say a few weeks ago, just recently, we had the paparazzi in the studio.

02:55:25.124 --> 02:55:25.805
[SPEAKER_07]: That was really cool.

02:55:25.825 --> 02:55:27.747
[SPEAKER_15]: That was pretty cool, but they made me play DDR.

02:55:27.787 --> 02:55:28.567
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, eh.

02:55:29.328 --> 02:55:30.830
[SPEAKER_07]: And that article still hasn't run yet.

02:55:30.870 --> 02:55:32.372
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been kind of waiting to see when that's going to show up.

02:55:32.392 --> 02:55:33.172
[SPEAKER_15]: Towards the end of the month, though.

02:55:33.192 --> 02:55:33.873
[SPEAKER_07]: Towards the end of the month?

02:55:33.993 --> 02:55:35.315
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so we'll see when it shows up.

02:55:35.615 --> 02:55:36.296
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully this week.

02:55:36.956 --> 02:55:38.338
[SPEAKER_07]: Entire episode 69, that's all I've got to say.

02:55:38.358 --> 02:55:39.459
[SPEAKER_07]: That was just messed up.

02:55:39.479 --> 02:55:40.040
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't here.

02:55:57.792 --> 02:56:00.414
[SPEAKER_07]: You heard episode 69 though, eventually, didn't you?

02:56:00.474 --> 02:56:02.255
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I heard I'm staying in.

02:56:02.675 --> 02:56:04.896
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean that was that whole karaoke revolution.

02:56:04.916 --> 02:56:05.656
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean it was episode 69.

02:56:06.617 --> 02:56:07.217
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you expect?

02:56:08.238 --> 02:56:10.639
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I was in San Diego staying in the Gay Fry House.

02:56:11.239 --> 02:56:12.040
[SPEAKER_07]: You were, you were.

02:56:12.740 --> 02:56:14.241
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not going to have that much fun on the show again.

02:56:14.261 --> 02:56:15.121
[SPEAKER_15]: In the Harry Potter closet.

02:56:15.441 --> 02:56:19.063
[SPEAKER_07]: The next time we will have that much fun on the show will be either episode 187 or episode 420.

02:56:19.103 --> 02:56:20.404
[SPEAKER_07]: If we make it that far.

02:56:25.342 --> 02:56:26.023
[SPEAKER_15]: You know we will.

02:56:26.543 --> 02:56:30.306
[SPEAKER_15]: We are here to stay because my ego will not let us quit.

02:56:32.628 --> 02:56:40.634
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I think that I have fun every week, so every week is a shining star in my memory.

02:56:43.997 --> 02:56:45.578
[SPEAKER_07]: Firebomba asked a follow-up question.

02:56:45.918 --> 02:56:47.900
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I like Dr. Pepper, Cherry, Vanilla?

02:56:48.861 --> 02:56:50.442
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, no, I do not.

02:56:52.643 --> 02:56:53.965
[SPEAKER_15]: That was so my fault, but no.

02:56:55.325 --> 02:56:57.687
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Pepper, it sounds great.

02:56:57.747 --> 02:56:59.288
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Pepper, awesome.

02:56:59.428 --> 02:57:00.789
[SPEAKER_07]: Cherry Soda, awesome.

02:57:00.829 --> 02:57:01.630
[SPEAKER_07]: Vanilla, awesome.

02:57:01.770 --> 02:57:02.430
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's diet.

02:57:02.650 --> 02:57:07.133
[SPEAKER_15]: I warned you when I went to Alabama and tried that shit there because it wasn't out here yet.

02:57:07.154 --> 02:57:09.195
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was like, okay, I'll try something new.

02:57:09.875 --> 02:57:15.860
[SPEAKER_15]: I drank probably an ounce of my 20-ounce bottle and threw it away.

02:57:16.340 --> 02:57:18.842
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't even pour it out because the poor plants would have died.

02:57:20.825 --> 02:57:25.528
[SPEAKER_07]: Legend of Zaku wants to know, will the ferrets have their own bar and lovemaking pad in the new place?

02:57:28.970 --> 02:57:32.453
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll try to think of something special for the ferrets, but we don't have any plans yet.

02:57:33.473 --> 02:57:35.275
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that's the best answer I have for that, sorry.

02:57:36.175 --> 02:57:44.341
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm so disappointed that my evil gateway to hell machine is so broken right now.

02:57:45.521 --> 02:57:47.963
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell are you doing?

02:57:49.867 --> 02:57:58.014
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, and Dark Knight, last question, the last Ask Orange Lounge question in this studio.

02:57:58.594 --> 02:58:02.918
[SPEAKER_07]: I keep feeling like we're having a final episode of the whole thing, but we're really not.

02:58:02.958 --> 02:58:16.689
[SPEAKER_07]: We are coming back, it's just going to be a new chapter, but the final Ask Orange Lounge of this studio is going to Dark Knight, and Dark Knight wants to know, Sky, can you take the webcam and show the studio one more time before the show ends?

02:58:18.746 --> 02:58:20.708
[SPEAKER_15]: I took pictures.

02:58:21.009 --> 02:58:23.211
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't have an FTP thing on here.

02:58:23.651 --> 02:58:30.178
[SPEAKER_15]: If someone will let me email it, I will send it to somebody if they'll put it up on the thing for me.

02:58:30.218 --> 02:58:33.021
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll make a gallery on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:58:33.101 --> 02:58:34.563
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get Jamie's pictures and Melody's.

02:58:34.623 --> 02:58:36.365
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh, I'm disconnected, I think.

02:58:37.466 --> 02:58:38.127
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep going.

02:58:38.347 --> 02:58:38.767
[SPEAKER_15]: No, you're there.

02:58:38.827 --> 02:58:39.308
[SPEAKER_15]: You're still on.

02:58:40.140 --> 02:58:41.181
[SPEAKER_15]: You were talking and it was still on.

02:58:41.982 --> 02:58:42.883
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my headphones came out.

02:58:42.903 --> 02:58:43.424
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what happened.

02:58:44.064 --> 02:58:44.324
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

02:58:46.667 --> 02:58:47.748
[SPEAKER_07]: His headphones turned gay!

02:58:48.329 --> 02:58:48.869
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God!

02:58:50.131 --> 02:58:50.491
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow!

02:58:51.072 --> 02:58:56.197
[SPEAKER_03]: That right there is my favorite part of Orange Lodge Radio ever in the studio with his headphones turning gay.

02:58:56.978 --> 02:58:57.418
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

02:58:57.498 --> 02:58:57.799
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God!

02:58:57.819 --> 02:58:59.240
[SPEAKER_07]: They're coming onto the mixing board!

02:58:59.580 --> 02:58:59.941
Woo!

02:59:00.582 --> 02:59:01.763
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, my headphones are back.

02:59:01.803 --> 02:59:02.784
[SPEAKER_07]: The show sounds okay again.

02:59:04.457 --> 02:59:07.099
[SPEAKER_07]: If you could take pictures too, because you've got a camera, and then we'll put them on our website.

02:59:07.199 --> 02:59:07.899
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that would be great.

02:59:08.699 --> 02:59:09.179
[SPEAKER_15]: The studio.

02:59:09.199 --> 02:59:09.620
[SPEAKER_07]: The studio.

02:59:10.040 --> 02:59:17.303
[SPEAKER_15]: And none of me, because I'm never... Okay, I'm going to take one picture after the show, but this is going to sound completely dirty.

02:59:17.964 --> 02:59:19.144
[SPEAKER_15]: We all have to cram into the kitchen.

02:59:19.964 --> 02:59:23.826
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I won't be in any pictures, because I'm not supposed to be.

02:59:24.066 --> 02:59:25.867
[SPEAKER_15]: I am mysterious, goddammit.

02:59:27.748 --> 02:59:29.589
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, anyway, so that's it.

02:59:30.395 --> 02:59:32.339
[SPEAKER_07]: and thus is the end of episode 139.

02:59:33.381 --> 02:59:36.928
[SPEAKER_07]: When we come back, season 6, episode 140.

02:59:38.459 --> 02:59:39.439
[SPEAKER_07]: We are starting over.

02:59:39.959 --> 02:59:42.200
[SPEAKER_07]: New studio, new sound for the station.

02:59:42.800 --> 02:59:44.300
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Launch Radio, what gamers really want.

02:59:44.941 --> 02:59:48.041
[SPEAKER_03]: Should I be disturbed that Jonas can put his entire fist in his mouth?

02:59:49.302 --> 02:59:50.522
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

02:59:51.282 --> 02:59:54.663
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, to end the show on a sappy note, thank you guys to the listeners.

02:59:56.223 --> 02:59:57.324
[SPEAKER_07]: We do this because of you guys.

02:59:57.784 --> 02:59:59.864
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys rock, honestly.

03:00:00.244 --> 03:00:02.845
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of you guys have been supporting the station since episode one.

03:00:03.625 --> 03:00:06.567
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of you guys, I know, like, just there's folks that have been listening since episode one.

03:00:06.587 --> 03:00:07.748
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of you guys haven't been listening.

03:00:08.229 --> 03:00:11.611
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of guys didn't come on board until, remember when we had the Uran premiere?

03:00:11.651 --> 03:00:13.132
[SPEAKER_07]: We got a lot of new people that night.

03:00:13.372 --> 03:00:14.193
[SPEAKER_07]: That was very awesome.

03:00:14.213 --> 03:00:18.136
[SPEAKER_07]: So thanks again to Mel B for helping hook us up with that.

03:00:18.176 --> 03:00:19.637
[SPEAKER_15]: You totally pimped our ride.

03:00:19.717 --> 03:00:20.357
[SPEAKER_07]: Miklatov.

03:00:22.059 --> 03:00:23.099
[SPEAKER_07]: Miklatov as well.

03:00:23.119 --> 03:00:23.800
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn right.

03:00:23.840 --> 03:00:25.241
[SPEAKER_07]: That really expanded our fan base.

03:00:25.859 --> 03:00:34.525
[SPEAKER_07]: Big thank you to DDR Freak Radio, who we've been doing more work with in the past year, showing that two stations with similar interests can work together for the common good.

03:00:35.245 --> 03:00:44.131
[SPEAKER_07]: And also a big thank you to Under Sedation Live, for which none of this, if Under Sedation Live did not exist, probably none of this would exist either.

03:00:44.211 --> 03:00:45.192
[SPEAKER_14]: We love you.

03:00:45.272 --> 03:00:47.754
[SPEAKER_07]: So, anything else?

03:00:48.194 --> 03:00:51.256
[SPEAKER_07]: Since we're not going to get to do an acceptance speech at the Best of Awards, probably.

03:00:51.496 --> 03:00:52.837
[SPEAKER_06]: This world is bullshit!

03:00:54.018 --> 03:00:55.599
[SPEAKER_06]: Go with yourself, just go with yourself.

03:01:01.421 --> 03:01:03.282
[SPEAKER_07]: We will be here next week with a show.

03:01:03.342 --> 03:01:06.223
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll just be a tape show, but it'll be kind of a bookend show.

03:01:06.263 --> 03:01:07.883
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll just be something to tie this week together.

03:01:08.464 --> 03:01:10.984
[SPEAKER_07]: In two weeks, May 1st, Orange Lounge Radio version 2.0.

03:01:12.205 --> 03:01:13.325
[SPEAKER_07]: What gamers really want to know.

03:01:16.486 --> 03:01:18.307
[SPEAKER_07]: And now, final thoughts.

03:01:18.547 --> 03:01:20.668
[SPEAKER_07]: And Mel B, you've got the mic, so you've got to start us off, buddy.

03:01:22.387 --> 03:01:22.867
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, man.

03:01:22.967 --> 03:01:28.230
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, I just hope that in this next place that we have, we'll actually have some furniture set up.

03:01:29.070 --> 03:01:36.094
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what sucks is the next studio is actually smaller, but it's just for, like, computers and Orange Lounge, so that's kind of the trade-off.

03:01:36.474 --> 03:01:41.016
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know, it was a lot more fun at the old house where we all had to be on top of each other.

03:01:41.036 --> 03:01:41.917
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be that again.

03:01:41.977 --> 03:01:42.697
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be that again.

03:01:43.197 --> 03:01:46.319
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, just for that, you've got to, like, mount some twister mats on the bottom of the floor.

03:01:46.539 --> 03:01:48.040
[SPEAKER_07]: But with better ventilation.

03:01:49.794 --> 03:01:51.577
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a window right there.

03:01:51.657 --> 03:01:52.257
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be nice.

03:01:52.598 --> 03:01:56.823
[SPEAKER_27]: But yeah, for going five seasons strong, I got to say, man, this is a pretty cool setup.

03:01:57.043 --> 03:02:02.229
[SPEAKER_27]: And I mean, on behalf of DDR Spot, I want to give you lots of props for keeping this thing going.

03:02:02.842 --> 03:02:05.344
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, you probably do a hell of a lot better than we do on the upkeep.

03:02:05.384 --> 03:02:13.509
[SPEAKER_27]: But hey, anything we can do, like they say, as far as from Spot's standpoint, if we can't win the race, we'll help the people in front of us break the record.

03:02:14.170 --> 03:02:14.630
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, buddy.

03:02:14.650 --> 03:02:15.230
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate that.

03:02:15.250 --> 03:02:15.711
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

03:02:15.731 --> 03:02:16.031
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

03:02:16.051 --> 03:02:16.691
[SPEAKER_07]: That's so sweet.

03:02:16.771 --> 03:02:21.214
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, Mel has not only done a lot for the station, but he's also helped me out a lot personally as well.

03:02:21.274 --> 03:02:22.595
[SPEAKER_15]: He did our first promo.

03:02:22.896 --> 03:02:23.236
[SPEAKER_07]: He did.

03:02:23.556 --> 03:02:24.817
[SPEAKER_07]: He was our first celebrity promo.

03:02:24.837 --> 03:02:27.899
[SPEAKER_15]: And we've been running that promo ever since.

03:02:28.199 --> 03:02:29.640
[SPEAKER_07]: He's our first celebrity promo.

03:02:30.681 --> 03:02:30.941
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

03:02:31.610 --> 03:02:32.731
[SPEAKER_07]: Sharks Girl, final thought.

03:02:33.451 --> 03:02:41.818
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, it's been fun in here, and when I heard you guys were doing the last show in this studio and I had nothing to do, I was like, I have to go up there just to harass them.

03:02:41.858 --> 03:02:44.100
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not going to tell anybody I'm showing up.

03:02:45.401 --> 03:02:50.264
[SPEAKER_07]: You've been a very frequent guest that has to drive a long way to get here, and we appreciate that.

03:02:50.284 --> 03:02:51.405
[SPEAKER_07]: About two hours at a time.

03:02:51.445 --> 03:02:52.786
[SPEAKER_07]: That is hella dedication.

03:02:52.826 --> 03:02:54.147
[SPEAKER_07]: We totally appreciate that, Sharks Girl.

03:02:54.167 --> 03:03:00.492
[SPEAKER_16]: It's always, always fun, and just hoping to best wishes for the new studio and as many good memories there are as we've had here.

03:03:01.334 --> 03:03:01.614
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

03:03:01.974 --> 03:03:03.395
[SPEAKER_05]: And Jonas.

03:03:04.455 --> 03:03:04.795
[SPEAKER_05]: Jonas.

03:03:07.196 --> 03:03:09.916
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, it's been one hell of a ride, I got to say.

03:03:10.076 --> 03:03:12.777
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, you do know, no show next week, right?

03:03:12.817 --> 03:03:13.837
[SPEAKER_07]: So don't come here.

03:03:13.957 --> 03:03:15.758
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to be busy anyway, so.

03:03:15.918 --> 03:03:17.158
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

03:03:17.198 --> 03:03:18.719
[SPEAKER_24]: Bitch is not a eulogy.

03:03:20.839 --> 03:03:26.141
[SPEAKER_28]: But anyway, I'm hoping the new move will be a great move and stuff, and hopefully things turn out pretty well.

03:03:27.181 --> 03:03:30.682
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm looking forward to see the next Orange Lounge, the next week for Orange Lounge Radio.

03:03:31.127 --> 03:03:31.367
[SPEAKER_04]: Angel

03:04:00.295 --> 03:04:29.584
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I haven't been listening since episode 1, I have been listening since episode 26 Been good times since then, been good times at this place And hope to continue it when we get to the new studio Good times to come, here we go Loki I'll be honest, this studio is a big hole Okay, the whole apartment is falling apart I mean, there's mold in my room I mean, the window's falling off The peephole goddamn shot out at me today Well, no, not today, but the other day

03:04:30.199 --> 03:04:31.600
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, you want me to go?

03:04:59.842 --> 03:05:01.691
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a request to hear the grudge sound real fast.

03:05:05.049 --> 03:05:06.430
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

03:05:06.450 --> 03:05:08.391
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm going to have to show this to you.

03:05:08.471 --> 03:05:15.036
[SPEAKER_07]: In the new place, in my new roommate, who, by the way, has never been on this show and has no idea what to expect, my new roommate.

03:05:15.817 --> 03:05:16.497
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a gamer, though.

03:05:16.517 --> 03:05:17.438
[SPEAKER_07]: He likes Donkey Konga.

03:05:17.638 --> 03:05:18.339
[SPEAKER_07]: He loves that game.

03:05:18.899 --> 03:05:19.619
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll see what happens.

03:05:19.960 --> 03:05:20.480
[SPEAKER_07]: My new roommate.

03:05:21.281 --> 03:05:23.442
[SPEAKER_07]: In his bedroom, he has the master bedroom in the new place.

03:05:23.742 --> 03:05:27.925
[SPEAKER_07]: In his bedroom, there's actually a little cutout that goes to the attic type thing.

03:05:28.406 --> 03:05:29.486
[SPEAKER_07]: And I did that the other night.

03:05:29.547 --> 03:05:30.968
[SPEAKER_07]: I started going, uh.

03:05:31.088 --> 03:05:32.188
[SPEAKER_07]: And now he says he can't sleep.

03:05:32.208 --> 03:05:32.629
[SPEAKER_15]: You know...

03:05:34.190 --> 03:05:42.297
[SPEAKER_15]: One of Dan's assistant managers at GameStop said that that sound is made by the vocal cords that control your high pitch and your low pitch.

03:05:42.757 --> 03:05:46.000
[SPEAKER_15]: That if you can make that noise, it means you have a very good vocal capacity.

03:05:47.801 --> 03:05:49.242
[SPEAKER_15]: Still ain't gonna get me to sing karaoke.

03:05:49.923 --> 03:05:55.147
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, my final thought is, again guys, I know this is sounding like a last show, but it is not over.

03:05:55.748 --> 03:05:57.209
[SPEAKER_07]: We are starting over.

03:05:59.572 --> 03:06:01.933
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to go with what I've been going with lately.

03:06:02.113 --> 03:06:03.274
[SPEAKER_15]: Reject false icons.

03:06:03.374 --> 03:06:04.194
[SPEAKER_15]: Think for yourself.

03:06:04.234 --> 03:06:05.034
[SPEAKER_15]: Decide what you like.

03:06:05.835 --> 03:06:06.135
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

03:06:07.295 --> 03:06:07.575
[SPEAKER_04]: Islander?

03:06:11.097 --> 03:06:12.717
[SPEAKER_36]: Angels fly because they take themselves lightly.

03:06:14.098 --> 03:06:14.478
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

03:06:15.459 --> 03:06:16.059
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, guys.

03:06:17.039 --> 03:06:18.500
[SPEAKER_07]: We're well over time tonight.

03:06:18.580 --> 03:06:19.880

[SPEAKER_07]: We think we have a little shot, a tiny shot at it, so please help us out.

03:06:36.301 --> 03:06:38.402
[SPEAKER_07]: Broadcaster of the Year, no way in hell.

03:06:38.502 --> 03:06:42.002
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no way in hell, but we appreciate the votes anyway.

[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the other stations nominated in that category have six digits, 100,000, 150,000.

03:06:53.304 --> 03:06:55.904
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so we're kind of like, we're the dark horse.

03:06:56.485 --> 03:06:57.365
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know what?

03:06:57.405 --> 03:06:58.745
[SPEAKER_07]: Fan base, show them what you can do.

03:07:01.429 --> 03:07:03.910
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, the final word in the final studio.

03:07:05.010 --> 03:07:08.811
[SPEAKER_07]: One, two, three, PANTS!
