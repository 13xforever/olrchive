Zomato 1999

00:02.000 --> 00:04.500
I'm Miho Hattori, straight out the purgatory

00:04.500 --> 00:07.000
Ai ai already, I'm passing your rate

00:07.000 --> 00:08.500
Don't be snob with me

00:08.500 --> 00:11.000
No aioli, children of Moby

00:11.000 --> 00:13.500
Obi Wan Kenobi told me in the lobby

00:13.500 --> 00:17.000
Technically, I'm dre and I can find a key

00:18.000 --> 00:20.500
There's a wall on Broadway

00:20.500 --> 00:23.000
No control, it's in my way

00:23.000 --> 00:25.500
I feel so gone with my song

00:25.500 --> 00:28.000
I got no respect for this game

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
There's a whole long road way

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Nothing wrong, it's in my way

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
I feel so wrong, where do I go?

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
I've got no reason for this game

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Our name is stereotype with a name

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
I've got to get the shit straight

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Can you relate? My mate, don't be late

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
My gate is open, downtown still sends me up in the sky

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
There's a whole long road way

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
Nothing wrong, it's in my way

00:57.000 --> 00:59.800
I feel so alone, wheres my soul?

00:59.800 --> 01:01.900
I got no respect for this game

01:01.900 --> 01:04.560
They're the hombres, stairs

01:04.560 --> 01:06.800
You know the drum is in my way

01:06.800 --> 01:09.460
I feel so alone, wheres my soul?

01:09.460 --> 01:11.640
I got no respect for this game

01:11.640 --> 01:13.560
They're the hombres, stairs

01:14.080 --> 01:16.740
You know the drum is in my way

01:16.740 --> 01:19.040
I feel so alone, wheres my soul?

01:19.040 --> 01:21.580
I got no respect for this game

01:21.580 --> 01:23.660
They're the hombres, stairs

01:23.660 --> 01:26.320
You know the drum is in my way

01:26.320 --> 01:31.320
I feel so good with my soul I got no reason for this game

01:56.320 --> 02:03.320
Orange Lounge Radio is presented in the TMI sound format.

02:26.320 --> 02:33.320
You're mentioning the old mad radium line, the body of radium, so much so that you can

02:56.320 --> 02:57.820
Whoa!

02:59.820 --> 03:00.820
Oh, God!

03:00.820 --> 03:03.320
Heh heh heh heh heh! Call me daddy!

03:04.820 --> 03:08.820
Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

03:08.820 --> 03:13.320

03:13.320 --> 03:17.320
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

03:17.320 --> 03:20.320
Orange Lounge may contain plenty of...

03:20.320 --> 03:22.820
...bluh...uh...bluh...cocky.

03:22.820 --> 03:27.820
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that. In this episode...

03:27.820 --> 03:29.820
Well isn't that special?

03:33.820 --> 03:44.820
Orange Lounge Radio Live is a fully interactive program via our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com

03:44.820 --> 03:52.820
And now, here are your hosts for Orange Lounge Radio Live, Dark Sakura, Skye and Loki.

03:53.820 --> 03:57.820
We are live!

03:58.820 --> 04:05.820
This is episode number 139 for this April 17th of 2005.

04:06.820 --> 04:12.820
You're tuned into the B-Mani scene's most empty radio station of all things B-Mani.

04:12.820 --> 04:16.820
My name is Rob Roberts, if you might know me as Sky.

04:16.820 --> 04:20.620
Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the

04:20.620 --> 04:21.620
farm.

04:21.620 --> 04:24.340
Say hello to Ms. Jamie Summers, you know her better as Dark Sakura.

04:24.340 --> 04:27.620
I am the titanium chef.

04:27.620 --> 04:30.060
You're better than an iron chef, you're the titanium chef.

04:30.060 --> 04:32.020
And I'm an internet celebrity.

04:32.020 --> 04:33.680
Yes you are, alright.

04:33.680 --> 04:36.820
And also with us tonight, say hello to Loki.

04:36.820 --> 04:38.820
Hi, I'm here.

04:38.820 --> 04:39.820
Alright.

04:39.820 --> 04:43.820
And also with us tonight, our regular guest, DDR Angel.

04:43.820 --> 04:46.820
Yay, I'm regular?

04:46.820 --> 04:47.820
Uh, yeah.

04:47.820 --> 04:49.820
Anyway, yes, so I...

04:49.820 --> 04:52.820
I don't know, that's a personal question, honey, I can't answer that.

04:52.820 --> 04:54.820
Shut up.

04:54.820 --> 04:56.820
I'm sure she keeps up with plenty of fiber.

04:56.820 --> 05:01.820
Alright, also joining us tonight, we have another special guest who just walked into the studio here.

05:01.820 --> 05:10.820
Say hello to our resident, I don't know, he's our resident, we need a title for him, I don't know.

05:10.820 --> 05:11.820
Pepsi bringer.

05:11.820 --> 05:12.820
Okay, Pepsi bringer.

05:12.820 --> 05:19.820
And he's a mod over on, oh no, a staff member over on the DDR Freak and a well-known community member, long-time player.

05:19.820 --> 05:20.820
Say hello to Islander.

05:20.820 --> 05:21.820
Hello.

05:21.820 --> 05:22.820
How you doing, sir?

05:22.820 --> 05:23.820
I am doing just fine yourself.

05:23.820 --> 05:29.240
just find yourself good I am a little sad though because as you have heard the

05:29.240 --> 05:36.920
rumors are true tonight is the last episode of orange lounge radio from this

05:36.920 --> 05:44.860
studio so I'm gonna say all the more reason I'm here but all right so yeah

05:44.860 --> 05:52.020
we're we are starting over actually this is yeah actually that's that's kind of

06:22.020 --> 06:25.380
That's a good way of putting it.

06:25.380 --> 06:26.380
With wires everywhere.

06:26.380 --> 06:27.380
Except with a lot more technology.

06:27.380 --> 06:31.460
And a hidden stash of heroin in Loki's room.

06:31.460 --> 06:34.900
My room literally has a pile of crap on top of the bed.

06:34.900 --> 06:40.940
It's just like this giant pile of clothes and records and god who knows what.

06:40.940 --> 06:45.820
I instantly was, I knew better because I've actually known someone who has a pile of real

06:45.820 --> 06:49.420
crap on his bed from his cat.

06:49.420 --> 06:50.420
It was very gross.

06:50.420 --> 06:51.420
Really?

06:51.420 --> 06:54.020
friend of mine's ex-boyfriend.

06:54.020 --> 06:58.780
Anyway, so our webcam tonight, unfortunately, because of the move going on, we're actually

06:58.780 --> 07:03.060
missing... the arcade cabinet is no longer here in the studio, the couch is no longer

07:03.060 --> 07:04.260
here in the studio.

07:04.260 --> 07:06.140
We tried to hook up the Shamu Cam.

07:06.140 --> 07:07.900
It was the coffee table.

07:07.900 --> 07:13.300
So we're... there's no computer to run a webcam, I think... the PlayStation 2's not even here

07:13.300 --> 07:14.300
anymore.

07:14.300 --> 07:20.300
My computer is, um, in the, um, the kitchen, for some reason.

07:20.300 --> 07:25.300
It's toasting something, apparently. I don't know.

07:25.300 --> 07:28.300
My other computer is over here next to the chair.

07:28.300 --> 07:30.300
It's an Amiga suddenly, and it wants toast.

07:30.300 --> 07:33.300
The metal dance pads are in the bathroom.

07:33.300 --> 07:38.300
The metal dance... I went in to take a shower today, and I'm like, what the fuck?

07:38.300 --> 07:41.300
There's a dance pad on the floor.

07:41.300 --> 07:43.300
It's a mess.

07:43.300 --> 07:46.420
So we would love to show this to you guys on webcam, but we have no way to do it.

07:46.420 --> 07:47.420
Yes we do.

07:47.420 --> 07:50.860
I have the transfer cable and my telephone.

07:50.860 --> 07:56.820
Okay, so maybe we'll figure something out, but for now...

07:56.820 --> 07:58.180
I really am too lazy to do that.

07:58.180 --> 08:05.380
For now, we're patching in the Sacramento webcam, so you can see the town where we live.

08:05.380 --> 08:10.540
All I need is an STP program or someone to put it up on somewhere for me.

08:10.540 --> 08:13.540
But I'll take pictures with my cell phone.

08:13.540 --> 08:15.540
Okay, maybe we could do something.

08:15.540 --> 08:18.540
Talk to Jason in our chat, our webmaster. Maybe we could set something up.

08:18.540 --> 08:19.540
I will after I eat dinner.

08:19.540 --> 08:20.540
Alright, anyway.

08:20.540 --> 08:28.540
So, big thanks to news10.net, who we are stealing the Sacramento webcam from, completely and utterly without permission.

08:28.540 --> 08:33.540
So, I hope, I figure if I work in that free plug.

08:33.540 --> 08:35.540
Yes, watch Desperate How's What?

08:35.540 --> 08:37.540
Actually don't, because that's on right now.

08:37.540 --> 08:47.540
What other shows are on ABC? Watch Lost, Wednesday night at some time on News 10.

08:47.540 --> 08:50.540
Unless you're not in Sacramento, then I guess you're screwed.

08:50.540 --> 08:52.540
Followed by Temple of Butt.

08:52.540 --> 08:54.540
Alright.

08:54.540 --> 08:58.540
Yes, watch The Bachelorette because nobody else is.

08:58.540 --> 09:00.540
Speaking of Temple of Butt...

09:00.540 --> 09:02.540
Alright, we'll be back after this.

09:02.540 --> 09:05.460
This is a live webcam of Sacramento.

09:05.460 --> 09:06.780
The chair is going, is that live?

09:06.780 --> 09:08.660
Yes, it is a live shot of Sacramento.

09:08.660 --> 09:10.360
It's only 6.30 here, so it's still bright.

09:10.360 --> 09:11.740
Anyway, we gotta take a break.

09:11.740 --> 09:12.580
That's all right.

09:12.580 --> 09:15.020
They don't realize we pre-record the webcam.

09:15.020 --> 09:16.380
We'll be back after this break

09:16.380 --> 09:19.280
featuring Bahmani songs with numbers in them.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.000
After this.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.660
One, two, three, four, five, six.

10:24.660 --> 10:28.580
Whoa, whoa!

10:28.580 --> 10:45.960
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!

11:15.960 --> 11:34.740
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,

12:04.740 --> 12:05.740
I'm trying to make you know it's true

15:05.740 --> 15:14.920
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

15:14.920 --> 15:19.780
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and I gotta say, we got surprised there during

15:19.780 --> 15:21.300
the break.

15:21.300 --> 15:27.980
Joining us for the very last episode of Orange Lounge Radio, from the studio, is Mel B.

15:27.980 --> 15:28.980
Supplies!

15:28.980 --> 15:29.980
What's up?

15:29.980 --> 15:30.980
How you doing?

15:30.980 --> 15:32.980
How you doin'?

15:32.980 --> 15:37.980
Oh man, all is good in the world, all is good.

15:37.980 --> 15:38.980
Sounds good.

15:38.980 --> 15:39.980
For the most part.

15:39.980 --> 15:40.980
For the most part.

15:40.980 --> 15:42.980
That's why we have FUs lately.

15:42.980 --> 15:43.980
Well yeah, we'll hear about the other half during FUs.

15:43.980 --> 15:46.980
And also joining us, of course, where there's Mel B, there's Sharks Girl.

15:46.980 --> 15:47.980
Hi guys.

15:47.980 --> 15:48.980
How you doin' hun?

15:48.980 --> 15:51.980
I brought Lumines for you to ogle.

15:51.980 --> 15:54.980
He actually has it too, I've already played it.

15:54.980 --> 15:56.980
But you guys should do the wireless thing, that might be fun.

15:56.980 --> 16:01.980
Okay, at least you're not going to be like obsessing over me just for my PSP.

16:01.980 --> 16:04.220
You have to tell that story on the air because it's too funny.

16:04.220 --> 16:05.700
I'll make you tell that later.

16:05.700 --> 16:09.500
So um, you should go check out his games, he's got quite a few.

16:09.500 --> 16:10.500
So anyway.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.980
Cool, because I only have like two and I never play any of them except like-

16:12.980 --> 16:13.980
Dude!

16:13.980 --> 16:14.980
Is that a-

16:14.980 --> 16:15.980
Oh my god!

16:15.980 --> 16:18.820
What the hell, is that a Genesis portable thing?

16:18.820 --> 16:19.820
A Nomad.

16:19.820 --> 16:20.820
A Nomad?

16:20.820 --> 16:22.820
I have one of those too.

16:22.820 --> 16:26.120
and you know that you can use the uh... the game gear power uh...

16:26.120 --> 16:28.460
battery pack on this too

16:28.460 --> 16:32.940
this is like portable gaming convention in the tsunami zone tonight here

16:32.940 --> 16:36.840
all right i'm just taking out moonwalker on the nomad and all i gotta say is man

16:36.840 --> 16:38.180
in times like these

16:38.180 --> 16:45.180
who better you know of a superhero den like psychotic pedophile

16:45.260 --> 16:47.140
anyway

16:47.140 --> 16:49.580
in that break

16:49.580 --> 16:55.140
that break we heard Jesper Kidd with the Tengoku remix or as some folks call it

16:55.140 --> 17:02.080
dot five nine before that Akira Yomoka 250 BPM before that DJ Naguro Lin

17:02.080 --> 17:07.220
1999 and starting that set off DJ Simon three two one stars all songs with

17:07.220 --> 17:11.100
numbers in them that break because we're just stretching for themes tonight

17:11.100 --> 17:17.700
anyway this is the final night here in this studio we're going to be moving to

17:17.700 --> 17:22.500
a brand new studio in the next town over Rancho Cambodia or I'm sorry Rancho

17:22.500 --> 17:30.300
Cordova so actually the nice thing about the new studio I've actually finally I

17:30.300 --> 17:33.960
got the keys to the new place so I actually checked out the new studio it's

17:33.960 --> 17:38.080
kind of comparable to what we had when we first started this show what we had

17:38.080 --> 17:43.740
episodes what about one through retro yeah so it's it's its own room but that

17:43.740 --> 17:46.740
means we get to decorate it however we want stuff so it's gonna be kind of cool

17:46.740 --> 17:51.700
so look forward to that in future episodes and future webcams. Again, though, the webcam

17:51.700 --> 17:57.860
tonight, not working. Instead, we've patched through the Channel 10's Sacramento webcam,

17:57.860 --> 18:03.700
so you can just check out the river. Did you really? I was there earlier today. And watch

18:03.700 --> 18:10.340
it slowly get darker. Wow. Yeah, I know, isn't it fascinating? It's about as exciting as

18:10.340 --> 18:15.580
our usual webcam when there's no guests here, so, where you get to watch the couch all night.

18:15.580 --> 18:23.600
and then you can see it slowly get darker outside anyway since we won't be

18:23.600 --> 18:27.960
in this new studio technically for two weeks we are not going to be here next

18:27.960 --> 18:33.040
week we are going to run a pre tape show though we're gonna be partying next week

18:33.040 --> 18:36.400
so there will be a new episode of orange on its radio but it will be kind of

18:36.400 --> 18:41.320
different it's going to be kind of the way for us to kind of close the chapter

18:41.320 --> 18:45.880
on this because really what's happening is that we're kind of as I said the

18:45.880 --> 18:51.600
theme is we are starting over so what's happening new yes we are actually kind

18:51.600 --> 18:54.660
of closing the chapter on this section of orange launch radio when we come back

18:54.660 --> 19:00.800
on the Sunday in two weeks everything's going to be different the music you hear

19:00.800 --> 19:03.360
on the station is going to be completely different as well so that's going to be

19:03.360 --> 19:10.360
May 1st everything kind of going on orange lounge radio what gamers really

19:10.360 --> 19:14.880
want to know it's kind of our new little mantra so stay tuned for that that's

19:14.880 --> 19:18.760
coming to you guys may 1st when we come back with orange lounge 140 but hey that

19:18.760 --> 19:21.760
doesn't mean we don't have anything for you guys tonight we got a fun show

19:21.760 --> 19:25.120
started off of course with the ever popular how was your week how was your

19:25.120 --> 19:30.260

19:30.260 --> 19:35.120

wheel pictures of it abound on the internet it's just really been a whole

19:41.720 --> 19:44.560
bunch of nothing I didn't get to play any Silent Hill which I'm kind of

19:44.560 --> 19:51.360
disappointed about although I did play Lego Star Wars on Xbox which was

19:51.360 --> 19:56.760
actually pretty funny and you can play as General Grievous from the next movie

19:56.760 --> 20:01.940
is it worth the buy just to laugh at it's entertaining but kind of

20:01.940 --> 20:04.800
frustrating it I would recommend it to kids except there's a couple of hard

20:04.800 --> 20:10.800
levels it's still kind of kind of funny thing seeing a Lego mace the only reason

20:10.800 --> 20:14.200
I wanted to interrupt and ask is because my friend actually bought me Lego racers

20:14.200 --> 20:22.640
on the old 64 and that was pretty funny this one's just funny um but yesterday I

20:22.640 --> 20:30.720
hung out with Julie all day shopping ooh Trader Joe's girls going shopping who

20:30.720 --> 20:40.780
would have thought oh hey girls gone shopping we did make fun of Paris Hilton

20:40.780 --> 20:49.920
a lot that's hot and I thought there was this girl who we were at the J Street

20:49.920 --> 20:54.100
Mall today and there's this girl who was absolutely flooded up wearing one of

20:54.100 --> 20:58.460
those little skirts that look like you know a lampshade cover and this halter

20:58.460 --> 21:03.900
And I wanted to stop her and ask her to say I'm doing interviews of prostitutes. What's it like living on the street?

21:08.540 --> 21:10.540
But I didn't feel too bitchy

21:10.700 --> 21:16.340
Because I had first because I had lunch at hard rock cafe. Okay. Do they have the Guinness Burger?

21:17.540 --> 21:21.780
They haven't given us buttons are made with Guinness. It's awesome. I

21:22.780 --> 21:25.180
Was like carbs. Yay. I'm gonna eat

21:25.180 --> 21:38.180
The buns are made with Guinness, and oh, Thursday, because there was no karaoke because someone decided to google something.

21:38.180 --> 21:39.180
Sorry.

21:39.180 --> 21:43.180
I went to Streets of London and had fish and chips in Guinness.

21:43.180 --> 21:44.180
No, that's fun.

21:44.180 --> 21:46.180
That made me happy, and they had real football on TV.

21:46.180 --> 21:47.180
That's right.

21:47.180 --> 21:51.180
Streets of London is like, I'm sure every big town has something like this.

21:51.180 --> 21:53.180
It's a British import pub, basically.

21:53.180 --> 21:54.180
It is a pub.

21:54.180 --> 21:59.500
Yeah, they've basically, they've kind of taken it on a giant, uh, crane and craned it over

21:59.500 --> 22:02.860
here to the United States and set it down in major cities.

22:02.860 --> 22:07.260
And you can actually order cheeps the way they should be, the potatoes, you know, and

22:07.260 --> 22:10.220
then you get to watch rugby and real football on the TV.

22:10.220 --> 22:13.380
Real football because American football is crap!

22:13.380 --> 22:18.380
I'm sorry, rugby is what you need to be watching because those men get bloody, you know, without

22:18.380 --> 22:23.260
they have padding on their head and that's about it, you know, because they have to,

22:23.260 --> 22:29.980
know have fun you know brain function not like what's-her-face anyway I went

22:29.980 --> 22:34.540
to the Crocker Museum today just to look at stuff because I had to do it for my

22:34.540 --> 22:38.220
art class there's some pretty cool stuff now what is what is the Crocker Museum

22:38.220 --> 22:42.380
for those not in the area it's an art museum downtown Zach in this really old

22:42.380 --> 22:46.300
house but made me think of a lot of the old houses in downtown mobile so sort of

22:46.300 --> 22:51.740
like whoa this is cool so kind of a Victorian style house kind of like it

22:51.740 --> 22:53.700
It was just, the house itself was awesome.

22:53.700 --> 22:57.500
They had a gallery for this Japanese artist there

22:57.500 --> 23:00.700
who did a lot of the representations

23:00.700 --> 23:02.780
of the kabuki actors.

23:02.780 --> 23:03.600
Very cool.

23:03.600 --> 23:04.740
It's pretty cool.

23:04.740 --> 23:07.540
And then did things on the Genji story.

23:07.540 --> 23:09.300
It was pretty cool.

23:09.300 --> 23:14.060
And then I went to this one exhibit though.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.100
I swear the sculptures in that

23:16.100 --> 23:17.860
were like right out of Silent Hill.

23:17.860 --> 23:21.740
I was like, this is pretty awesome.

23:21.740 --> 23:26.820
And then I had to pick a picture that I really, really liked and then I had to pick

23:26.820 --> 23:31.260
something that I hated and say why I hated it. And the one I picked that I hated

23:31.260 --> 23:32.500
was called, uh,

23:32.500 --> 23:35.580
like, Angels a la Mode or something.

23:35.580 --> 23:40.980
It was this ceramic, shiny lady with this big, poofy hair and little angels hanging

23:40.980 --> 23:41.540
all over.

23:41.540 --> 23:47.020
I was like, this is ugly. That is a really odd comment to come back in. I just start hearing

23:47.020 --> 23:56.020
about a ceramic lady with angels. I went to the museum today and then there's a

23:56.020 --> 23:59.740
picture that I really liked when you walk into the gallery it's humongous it

23:59.740 --> 24:05.020
takes up almost this whole piece of wall it's this old man who sort of looks like

24:05.020 --> 24:09.340
Patrick Stewart sort of but really you know shaggy beard shaggy hair laying down

24:09.340 --> 24:15.400
like he's dying but he looks really aware of himself but as you approach the

24:15.400 --> 24:20.680
picture sounds kind of erotic there's these pastel figures all scattered about

24:20.680 --> 24:25.960
it and for a moment I thought that this might be it's called a glee K which is

24:25.960 --> 24:30.320
a G clay that's what it's called which is a digital in a movie with Ben Affleck

24:30.320 --> 24:38.980
and Jennifer Lopez and G play just easy but what what that is is a digital image

24:38.980 --> 24:44.600
that's transferred to canvas and this was actually all done in acrylics on

24:44.600 --> 24:47.960
canvas on this massive canvas that took him something like five years to

24:47.960 --> 24:52.220
complete and I was really impressed with that picture I took a picture of it

24:52.220 --> 24:56.180
though I wasn't supposed to but I did it was really cool but it was called a

24:56.180 --> 24:59.000
portrait of my father as well as called I'll find I'll get the name and

24:59.000 --> 25:02.120
everything those really cool picture and for me I was like oh I feel all artsy

25:02.120 --> 25:09.320
fartsy this is cool and then they had an exhibit of African artifacts including

25:09.320 --> 25:17.480
some cool axes and everything it was really awesome I had a nerd day your

25:17.480 --> 25:21.080
laundry is going crazy yeah I better go rescue my laundry from your machine is

25:21.080 --> 25:29.640
the washer walking off I quit I guess so I don't know what happened there anyway

25:29.640 --> 25:33.640
wow that's the first okay anyway moving on with how's your week how's your day

25:33.640 --> 25:39.280
so hopefully if dark Sakura can get some pictures of her artistic day she can

25:39.280 --> 25:43.800
post those up on the forums and you guys can check that out. Alright, uh, moving on with

25:43.800 --> 25:46.720
How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day. Let's just go, uh, Sharks Girl, you got a mic next

25:46.720 --> 25:53.480
to you, why not? What's up? Okay. Well, obviously my day involved coming here, just for the

25:53.480 --> 25:57.160
heck of it. I was like, yesterday I'm like, it's the last episode of Orange Lounge in

25:57.160 --> 26:05.280
that studio. You wanna go? And that was that. Very cool. I decided. So, I got a new job.

26:05.280 --> 26:22.280
My new job is really quite nice. It's a temp for a few months, so I get paid weekly, which is nifty, and it's nice to work at a place where you don't feel like everyone's going to backstab you at any given second, and you actually enjoy working with your coworkers, so I've been very mellow lately, so that's a good thing.

26:22.280 --> 26:23.280
That's good, that's good.

26:23.280 --> 26:25.280
Yeah, so I'm kind of boring, but that's okay.

26:25.280 --> 26:27.280
No, that's alright. New jobs are fun.

26:27.280 --> 26:29.280
And new jobs with lots of money are fun, too.

26:29.280 --> 26:31.280
Yes, they are. Yes, sir.

26:31.280 --> 26:33.280
Anything else? Any gaming stuff?

26:33.280 --> 26:39.480
I've just been playing like luminous and I alternate between luminous on the PSP and zookeeper on DS and

26:40.700 --> 26:44.500
What now you and Loki outside was he showing you how to hack your PSP?

26:44.500 --> 26:47.940
Is that what he was doing outside trying to hack into the neighbors wireless internet?

26:51.280 --> 26:55.560
It was not only tried it was succeeded do you have wipeout on your

26:59.500 --> 27:01.900
Okay, so learning from the best I guess

27:01.900 --> 27:06.900
So now you can, you know, drive around the neighborhood and see what wireless internet you can hack into.

27:06.900 --> 27:11.900
Well, I have wireless at my house, so if I'm feeling lazy and just don't want to get on my laptop, you know, there you go.

27:11.900 --> 27:18.900
There you go. Absolutely. All right. Moving on, Mel. Mr. Mel B. How was your week? How was your day?

27:18.900 --> 27:29.900
The week was pretty interesting. I actually started a new job myself on Monday, working as an editor at this one place that actually does a lot of assessment and standards for kids.

27:29.900 --> 27:31.200
for kids alike

27:31.200 --> 27:33.600
great five through eleven i'd be

27:33.600 --> 27:37.180
basically editing and printing a bunch of uh... assessment

27:37.180 --> 27:39.960
something like the tbs at the key type stuff

27:39.960 --> 27:43.480
so it's kind of uh... cool job to get paid you know the good amount of money

27:43.480 --> 27:45.000
to tell people they're wrong

27:45.000 --> 27:47.520
you know but i thought

27:47.520 --> 27:51.320
you know it nothing to keep you just yell for a job application for the back

27:51.320 --> 27:53.440
of that

27:53.440 --> 27:55.240
i'm sorry you know

27:55.240 --> 27:57.260
uh...

27:57.260 --> 28:00.880
for those who didn't hear that jamie said i'll do that for free

28:00.880 --> 28:04.720
well yeah it's it's it's good times aside from the commute being in like san

28:04.720 --> 28:07.960
francisco and i'm in like redwood city it's about like half hour plus parking

28:07.960 --> 28:08.720
in

28:08.720 --> 28:12.560
the city and always that great but it's all good but uh... get a nice view it

28:12.560 --> 28:15.960
everything is pretty cool i mean it's like one of those kickback jobs like

28:15.960 --> 28:18.800
it's eight hours but i get my stuff done by one o'clock and then i try to go to

28:18.800 --> 28:21.600
my bosses office to find something you know like what to do

28:21.600 --> 28:24.800
she stuck in meetings to like four o'clock so i got three hours of dead

28:24.800 --> 28:29.080
time so you know it's it's all good I get to listen to orange lounge all day

28:29.080 --> 28:38.440
so hey all right you know so I'm feeling that um other crazy stuff actually it

28:38.440 --> 28:42.320
was funny was something mentioned on I guess it was yeah DDR freak a couple

28:42.320 --> 28:45.840
weeks ago someone had put up like an unofficial like top 50 freestyle

28:45.840 --> 28:51.040
routines of all time in like North America and me and my boys like we

28:51.040 --> 28:54.200
started coming up with this idea like maybe we should get a couple people like

28:54.200 --> 28:58.660
all together get some ideas around we actually want to put up a list of like

28:58.660 --> 29:02.340
top 100 free no freestyles of like North American history like coming from a

29:02.340 --> 29:06.620
freestyle perspective coming from like someone who's just an avid fan and it's

29:06.620 --> 29:10.420
something that we're gonna do like probably in a month or two I got it

29:10.420 --> 29:16.580
right now the first annual DDR freestyle history I don't know they can do some

29:16.580 --> 29:21.540
sort of like award show for that you know have best improv routine well just

29:21.540 --> 29:26.180
I love the freestyle and get how far we'll get no, thank you. That was my idea

29:26.180 --> 29:30.900
We'll get how sparks to comment on everything. I mean, yeah, well, I mean we can start it off in like 1999

29:32.900 --> 29:37.440
And then we can go through every year who the big names were in 2000 2001 all the way till now

29:37.440 --> 29:44.800
You're like yo 2001 head slaps and knee drops. Yo, that was ill man. That was the greatest post 18 videos

29:47.540 --> 29:50.420
You know, I was actually considering walking around with my turn Orochi

29:50.420 --> 29:51.780
she uh...

29:51.780 --> 29:57.100
like own heart

29:57.100 --> 29:58.300
while

29:58.300 --> 30:01.020
uh... but it's just some stuff like that and we actually want to

30:01.020 --> 30:03.680
do something with spot sometime we can actually get like

30:03.680 --> 30:07.180
our database back in the house of the spot is going to be working again

30:07.180 --> 30:10.660
yeah i don't think it's like our webmaster you know that i have a back

30:10.660 --> 30:14.480
end of the china right now so

30:14.480 --> 30:18.660
yeah uh... if he's not that sucks when your website goes to china that that

30:18.660 --> 30:21.820
that's uh... no fun at all

30:21.820 --> 30:25.140
uh... but you know we want to do something like that we actually want to get videos back up and all

30:25.140 --> 30:26.440
that kind of stuff it's like

30:26.440 --> 30:29.100
there's a lot of people they've only seen stuff maybe two thousand two two

30:29.100 --> 30:30.780
thousand five you know it's

30:30.780 --> 30:33.660
it'd just be some because there's really nothing better to do

30:33.660 --> 30:34.820
i mean

30:34.820 --> 30:39.340
since there's no new arcade mixes or anything we'll just reminisce about old arcade mixes

30:39.340 --> 30:43.700
yeah we you know the longer longer we lived the more we remember DDR used to

30:43.700 --> 30:46.260
be good

30:46.260 --> 30:50.580
uh... but uh... speaking of that uh... actually also posted up a article

30:50.580 --> 30:53.880
uh... if this is not what i think it is or talk about is more detail later

30:53.880 --> 30:55.100
okay yeah well yeah

30:55.100 --> 30:58.560
all right don't want to see a car as if you don't something that was that that

30:58.560 --> 31:02.820
will probably uh... talked about later yes i don't know if you think that

31:02.820 --> 31:08.820
the uh... we have three hours to build a blow it all down

31:08.820 --> 31:11.340

however one becomes all chummy like a month before it happens but you know

31:52.100 --> 31:54.940
it's all good it's the price of fame

31:54.940 --> 31:57.460
it'll be even more interesting to see how many people get with me when they

31:57.460 --> 32:01.820
feel the media passing can get fun goodies

32:01.820 --> 32:04.740

and uh...

33:03.940 --> 33:06.540
aside from that not really a whole lot of too much

33:06.540 --> 33:07.380
uh...

33:07.380 --> 33:12.680
I actually went and played P.I.U. today for the first time in, like, ages.

33:12.680 --> 33:16.380
And to the non-hipsters, that's Pump It Up. P.I.U., Pump It Up.

33:16.380 --> 33:18.380
Cat 49! Cat 49!

33:19.380 --> 33:21.380
Yes, and I actually did play that song, actually.

33:22.380 --> 33:26.380
But yeah, it was just pretty interesting just to go to a place that had video games,

33:26.380 --> 33:29.380
and you put a dollar in the machine, and it actually gave out quarters!

33:30.380 --> 33:32.380
It's like, wow! It's like, I'd use it somewhere else!

33:32.380 --> 33:37.380
I can get laundry money from a pump-it-up machine?

33:37.380 --> 33:38.380
Yeah, really.

33:38.380 --> 33:39.380
It was hot.

33:39.380 --> 33:40.380
You don't know.

33:40.380 --> 33:41.380
No idea.

33:41.380 --> 33:42.380
But no.

33:42.380 --> 33:43.380
Let's see.

33:43.380 --> 33:44.380
Ooh.

33:44.380 --> 33:45.380
I went to the Nio's.

33:45.380 --> 33:46.380
Walked around for a bit.

33:46.380 --> 33:48.380
I found, like, the greatest Eddie Guerrero shirt.

33:48.380 --> 33:49.380
Really?

33:49.380 --> 33:52.380
It had, like, pictures in San Andreas style and it said, license is still.

33:52.380 --> 33:53.380
I see that.

33:53.380 --> 33:54.380
I see that.

33:54.380 --> 33:55.380
I still don't want to cry.

33:55.380 --> 33:56.380
Picked that one up.

33:56.380 --> 33:57.380
Nice.

33:57.380 --> 33:58.380
But, yeah.

33:58.380 --> 33:59.380
That's pretty much it.

33:59.380 --> 34:00.380
All right.

34:00.380 --> 34:02.380
Loki, how was your week? How was your day?

34:04.380 --> 34:10.380
It was hell. It was all hell. It sucked. This entire week sucked.

34:11.380 --> 34:17.380
And I started off with, I got, okay, first I started my new job, game sales. That's all good, you know, starting the training stuff.

34:18.380 --> 34:28.380
And, you know, it's just grueling. It's just very, they're having me, I'm fighting with this stupid person in Dallas because they think they know everything about, you know, certain games that are coming out.

34:28.380 --> 34:32.820
that were coming out. I've been doing this for 18 years. So, you know, this first sheet,

34:32.820 --> 34:36.980
I'm like, she gives me this thing that says, you know, our new releases that were coming

34:36.980 --> 34:42.060
up in May. And the first thing that's on there is Ape Escape for the PSP. I'm like, I think

34:42.060 --> 34:45.740
the state's wrong because it's in stores right now. It was one of the launch titles. No,

34:45.740 --> 34:49.700
it got pushed back to May. No, it's in the stores. I picked it up with my hand, thought

34:49.700 --> 34:55.620
about buying it, saw it sucked, and then put it back down. And, you know, and then, you

34:55.620 --> 35:00.860
You know, she's like, there's this other title on there that was, what was it?

35:00.860 --> 35:03.820
Hey Arnold, the movie, the game for the GBA.

35:03.820 --> 35:09.900
I'm like, hold on, hold on, hey Arnold, the movie, the game.

35:09.900 --> 35:10.900
Exactly.

35:10.900 --> 35:11.900
Okay.

35:11.900 --> 35:17.660
Okay, and that game, that game came out three years ago, when the movie came out.

35:17.660 --> 35:19.060
And she still insists it's a new release.

35:19.060 --> 35:23.520
I'm like, okay, so that's when I had to get my boss involved.

35:23.520 --> 35:26.300
saw the emails go back and forth and he joked to me because he actually has a

35:26.300 --> 35:30.160
he's understanding so he's like so you're trying to piss off you know the

35:30.160 --> 35:37.440
neighbor or fuck is that kid doing it there Oh giant paper airplane fucking

35:37.440 --> 35:41.480

35:41.480 --> 35:46.080
off the Dallas people but anyways I'm like trying to piss off the neighbor

35:46.080 --> 35:52.960
throwing the giant paper airplane what the hell is wrong what kind of

35:52.960 --> 35:55.960
What kind of inbred people do we have living around here, I swear.

35:55.960 --> 35:56.960
Anyways, back to-

35:56.960 --> 35:58.960
I don't think we were in Mississippi.

35:58.960 --> 36:00.960
Back to the story, okay.

36:00.960 --> 36:02.960
So yeah, this has been going on all week.

36:02.960 --> 36:06.960
What's kind of cool though is they're actually kind of serious about the game side of everything.

36:06.960 --> 36:10.960
So they're going to convert our conference room into a game room with a giant plasma screen TV.

36:10.960 --> 36:12.960
So that's kind of cool.

36:12.960 --> 36:18.960
So I've been doing that and then this week, this weekend, I got to move!

36:18.960 --> 36:19.960
Yay!

36:19.960 --> 36:21.960
So this entire week was packing.

36:21.960 --> 36:28.240
then today and yesterday was moving and that sucked and I still have tons more

36:28.240 --> 36:33.600
left and that let me just put this away that arcade cabinet I think was never

36:33.600 --> 36:37.520
meant to move at all because you know I tried moving it today first thing that

36:37.520 --> 36:41.600
happened the wheels pushed through the bottom on the front so like ah shit that

36:41.600 --> 36:46.520
sucks now it won't roll so then we sat here lean the cabinet back on you know

36:46.520 --> 36:51.520
it's back wheels for a while and I tried to reinforce the bottom with screws set

36:51.520 --> 36:54.760

36:54.760 --> 36:59.960

37:20.740 --> 37:25.140
cabinet to the house and we had the wheel it around and finally got it in

37:25.140 --> 37:30.020
there we had a dodge like this light that was by my door and in the fire

37:30.020 --> 37:35.060
extinguisher in this glass case you know I have to dodge all that stuff barely fit

37:35.060 --> 37:38.740
through and you should have seen the couch yesterday because see the way our

37:38.740 --> 37:42.020
apartments set up you've kind of got the two apartments right there and it's like

37:42.020 --> 37:45.420
a walkway that goes in front of both of them and then the apartment next to me

37:45.420 --> 37:50.180
has the sidewalk that's actually coming you know away from the apartment and for

37:50.180 --> 37:58.180
For me, all I've got is this hole between the bush that's just about enough, you know, wide enough to fit the couch. Just barely.

37:58.180 --> 38:02.180
What the fuck is my phone ringing for? God dammit.

38:02.180 --> 38:06.180
Anyways...

38:06.180 --> 38:08.180
Hello?

38:08.180 --> 38:12.180
Did you forget you were trying to do a show?

38:12.180 --> 38:15.180
This is why cell phones need to be turned off during the show.

38:15.180 --> 38:18.180
Should we like start playing the Jeopardy theme or something?

38:18.180 --> 38:20.380
do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

38:20.380 --> 38:22.960
start making orgasm noises.

38:22.960 --> 38:26.740
That was Nellie and i'm gonna get into this too okay.

38:26.740 --> 38:29.320
She was asking me if i needed pants.

38:29.320 --> 38:38.540
because, you see, yesterday, while moving, hold on.

38:38.540 --> 38:41.520
Okay, lemme think about this.

38:41.520 --> 38:47.260
She knows that you do a radio show on the internet that is nominated for Broadcaster

38:47.260 --> 38:53.600
of the Year, okay? So we are one of five stations nominated Broadcaster of the Year, so she

38:53.600 --> 39:00.480
understands what kind of commitment you put in Sunday nights. She calls you, interrupts

39:00.480 --> 39:07.960
the show to ask you if you have pants. Rob, I'm getting to that, okay? Gosh, it, I was

39:07.960 --> 39:17.960
That's the one that I asked her, okay? She was nice enough to go offer to get me pants at Walmart because, you know, the goddamn store's closed, okay? The mall.

39:17.960 --> 39:24.960
Anyways, because the pants I had, my dress pants that I usually wear around for everything because I don't buy jeans for some reason.

39:24.960 --> 39:29.960
So anyways, for some reason my ass seems to break through pants like crazy. I don't know why.

39:29.960 --> 39:36.960
And so, so basically, I had busted pants. You know, I have one pair of pants left that I'm not really sure if I have.

39:36.960 --> 39:41.660
So, just to be on the safe side, I got a backup pair of pants just to make sure.

39:41.660 --> 39:45.960
No! Are you having problems with your ass?

39:45.960 --> 39:54.460
So anyways, that is why she called, because she wanted me to, I was supposed to check to see if I had the pants in the dryer.

39:54.460 --> 39:59.700
and I didn't quite get to do that before the show so she's getting me back up

39:59.700 --> 40:05.100
Sarah of pants just in case anyways so pants problem aside so then didn't add

40:05.100 --> 40:11.220
to this big smorgasbord of crap we have we have I was driving home today and

40:11.220 --> 40:18.580
guess what comes on I love you check engine light so then you know so then I

40:18.580 --> 40:22.260
had to go next door drop the car off so you know I could see what's wrong

40:22.260 --> 40:25.620
because the check engine lights like something's wrong but I'm not telling

40:25.620 --> 40:29.940
you what something is wrong it could be as little as the gas cap or it could be

40:29.940 --> 40:33.660
your engines falling apart but we're not going to tell you I'm just going to turn

40:33.660 --> 40:37.980
on the light and you got to take it down to the shop so they can laugh at you if

40:37.980 --> 40:42.260
it's something stupid you know which I checked the gas you know cap three times

40:42.260 --> 40:46.940
all my fluids are fine so it's nothing I did to the car it's just the car

40:46.940 --> 40:52.780
falling apart. Your fluids are fine. Does, does the car need pants? The car does not

40:52.780 --> 41:04.260
need pants. But yeah, last week. GIVE ME PANTS! Yeah, last week. Yes, I've seen. Yeah, that's

41:04.260 --> 41:11.020
true. Anyways, so, pants, car, moving, stuff aside, um, it's been an okay week. It's just,

41:11.020 --> 41:16.420
it's one hell of a hectic week, and it's not gonna get any better this week, so. Um, oh

41:16.420 --> 41:26.420
Oh well. Our chat room, which I haven't plugged yet, www.oranselmtrader.com. Click on chat. There's already a ton of people in there. I don't need to plug it because it's a party in there already, but hopefully some of you guys will want to join it.

41:26.420 --> 41:35.420
We don't have the chat room, unfortunately, on the TV studio cam today. Only I and Dark Soccer can see it, but we will pass along the messages, such as,

41:35.420 --> 41:43.420
Firebomba has an explanation for why Loki is ripping all his pants. Firebomba's suggesting you're getting fat, fatty.

41:43.420 --> 41:48.420
I'm okay I'm not getting fat it's actually not my ass is ripping him at the

41:48.420 --> 41:52.420
fucking crotch gets ripped and then my nuts are too big over the pan and then

41:52.420 --> 41:56.780
hold on and then goes on to say fatty McTubs might have to lose some tons

41:56.780 --> 42:01.540
say I've fucking got tons of exercise week lifting the goddamn couch and

42:01.540 --> 42:05.500
moving the cabinet and shit I've lifted enough boxes and done enough exercise

42:05.500 --> 42:09.620
this week and there was sex involved too so goddamn it I've had my fill of

42:09.620 --> 42:14.940

42:35.020 --> 42:38.860
Whole new meaning to the term-swelled head.

42:38.860 --> 42:41.660
She wasn't complaining this morning.

42:41.660 --> 42:52.540
You're listening to KTMI, too much information all the time.

42:52.540 --> 42:57.180
We're experiencing technical difficulties right now.

42:57.180 --> 42:58.500
The host is speechless.

42:58.500 --> 43:00.140
We've got big balls?

43:00.140 --> 43:02.300
He's got big balls.

43:02.300 --> 43:03.900
Let's try this again.

43:03.900 --> 43:04.900
Angel!

43:04.900 --> 43:11.900
how was your week how was your day

43:12.640 --> 43:15.840
just uh... working on school stuff and uh...

43:15.840 --> 43:16.940
working

43:16.940 --> 43:22.620
yada yada and

43:22.620 --> 43:26.100
working on school and pets

43:26.100 --> 43:33.280
my pants are probably fine thank you very much

43:33.280 --> 43:36.840
it could be a fortune cookie, I don't know, that's up to uh...

43:36.840 --> 43:38.360
instead of like

43:38.360 --> 43:43.280
adding in bed to your fortune you add with pants

43:43.280 --> 43:46.200
oh no

43:46.200 --> 43:47.900
that could work

43:47.900 --> 43:52.600
no no no no no, don't make me think about that

43:52.600 --> 43:57.900
just uh... I actually found time to play final fantasy 11 this week

43:57.900 --> 44:01.280
not really, not if I just picked it up this week

44:01.280 --> 44:06.760
all the time

44:06.760 --> 44:10.720
yeah i think that's good enough and then uh... and um... for the record of getting

44:10.720 --> 44:13.000
in the case kind of

44:13.000 --> 44:16.340
wrong and interesting at the same time

44:16.340 --> 44:18.640
and uh... i'm gonna let rob uh...

44:18.640 --> 44:23.020
maybe fill in that blank because i'm not consider explain it again

44:23.020 --> 44:25.400
and he came from as eleven basically she got

44:25.400 --> 44:27.560
she got scary monsters trained on top of her

44:27.560 --> 44:29.260
and it's no fun at all

44:29.260 --> 44:31.460
and uh... teleported out

44:31.460 --> 44:35.740
he's called g m on that day

44:35.740 --> 44:36.900
right moving on

44:36.900 --> 44:40.620
uh... my week of my day was uh... pretty cool i can't top the panting though

44:40.620 --> 44:43.380
honestly so i don't really know what i could say i did see it

44:43.380 --> 44:45.740
you can't copy and

44:45.740 --> 44:49.560
i did see margaret show on thursday which is pretty cool to build a lot of

44:49.560 --> 44:54.700
uh... was a lot of recycled stuff from the last or which is kind of sad but

44:54.700 --> 44:56.360
but you find that

44:56.360 --> 45:00.220
but you have to have their body

45:00.220 --> 45:06.620
what else is going on uh... i uh...

45:06.620 --> 45:11.900
if you tell mike and mike and

45:11.900 --> 45:15.740
okay i can i guess he did find past but for the record he is currently wearing

45:15.740 --> 45:16.940
shorts

45:16.940 --> 45:20.140
so it's not like he's completely bottomless here

45:20.140 --> 45:22.180
into

45:22.180 --> 45:23.660
something to note here

45:23.660 --> 45:24.620
uh...

45:24.620 --> 45:29.620
And then, I've also kind of been moving a little bit as well, I, as I said, you know, got the keys to the new place.

45:29.620 --> 45:32.620
My big move stuff comes next Sunday, though, so I'm still here.

45:32.620 --> 45:37.620
I was going to say, for having move stuff, there sure is a lot of shit on top of your computer desk, right?

45:37.620 --> 45:43.620
Yeah, no, I haven't, I'm not moving until Sunday, but I kind of checked out the new place, and that's about it, nothing big.

45:43.620 --> 45:50.620
Let's see, that's about it. I really can't top the other stuff going on, so.

45:50.620 --> 45:56.120
You know, we weren't here last week. Everybody kind of had their own thing going on last weekend.

45:56.120 --> 46:00.120
I went and saw Garbage, the band, in San Francisco, so that was cool.

46:00.120 --> 46:01.120
Blah to you, I say.

46:01.120 --> 46:04.120
They're not garbage. They're actually pretty good.

46:04.120 --> 46:09.120
Blah to you, I say, but I can top you. I get to see Garbage when it's open for Alanis Morissette.

46:09.120 --> 46:11.120
Ugh, hate you.

46:11.120 --> 46:14.120
Anyway, all right, let's go to a break. We definitely need a break here.

46:14.120 --> 46:18.620
When we come back, more antics here on Orange Ons Radio, including some Bamani news.

46:18.620 --> 46:22.100
there's actually been quite a bit in the past two weeks so of the thing that Mel

46:22.100 --> 46:27.660
hinted at earlier we'll get to also Polteri says something relevant it's

46:27.660 --> 46:33.220

Gonna take your fear away, flyin' like a snow-a-dub, oh, oh, temple of love

47:44.620 --> 47:50.620
Coming to the temple of love, and together we'll bring to the heavens above

47:50.620 --> 47:52.620
Come to the temple of the dark

47:52.620 --> 47:56.620
You're falling asleep, you're playing the devil's master

48:22.620 --> 48:29.620
Let me know what you think in the comment section below, and I'll see you guys in the next video.

49:22.620 --> 49:24.620
You

49:52.620 --> 50:18.500
Look at what you see, the mirror of a dream Make believe I'm everywhere, living in your

50:18.500 --> 50:22.500
written on the pages

50:22.500 --> 50:29.500
it's the answer to a never-ending story

50:29.500 --> 50:32.500
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

50:32.500 --> 50:36.500
never-ending story

50:36.500 --> 50:39.500
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

50:39.500 --> 50:54.000
Life is a gift that's a friend when I fall behind the clouds

50:54.000 --> 50:57.000
Care is fun, the rain falls

50:57.000 --> 51:01.000
She hates it too, but never ends

51:01.000 --> 51:07.000
It's only love

51:07.000 --> 51:11.000
But it never ends, no, it ain't

51:11.000 --> 51:14.000
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

51:21.000 --> 51:24.000
Follow the sound, follow the sound

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
We're leaving the rain behind

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
Together we'll be in harmony

51:30.000 --> 51:40.000
Taking the time, we will find our way

51:44.000 --> 51:48.000
Sunshine, I feel your energy, I need sunshine

51:48.000 --> 51:51.000
But it's not on me now, sunshine

51:51.000 --> 51:54.000
Don't you hide away, I want sunshine

51:54.000 --> 52:04.720
every day

52:06.480 --> 52:08.880
I need sunshine, I feel your energy

52:20.240 --> 52:23.440
I need some time, you're falling down on me now

52:23.440 --> 52:25.840
Some time, don't get high or away

52:25.840 --> 52:30.840
I want some time with you just every day

52:55.840 --> 53:03.800
So the best part of Orange Lounge this DDR sucks.

53:03.800 --> 53:04.800
Hollar!

53:04.800 --> 53:07.780
The, the, the, the, the, the winners.

53:07.780 --> 53:08.780
TTPO.

53:08.780 --> 53:18.300
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 139, the last episode of Orange Lounge

53:18.300 --> 53:20.020
Radio from our current studio.

53:20.020 --> 53:21.020
Aww.

53:21.020 --> 53:25.080
This DDR sucks pants.

53:25.080 --> 53:28.080
Let the joke die. Step away from the joke.

53:28.080 --> 53:36.080
Okay, if Jeff K. could live into Final Fantasy XI this long, I can have pants joy. Thank you.

53:36.080 --> 53:39.080
I remembered something during How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, I wanted to talk about

53:39.080 --> 53:46.080
that I didn't get a chance to, because I got sidetracked by pants. I went to an antique

53:46.080 --> 53:50.080
store yesterday with my mom, because my mom loves shopping for antiques. You know, go

53:50.080 --> 53:56.000
and I was looking around and I actually saw these antique like cactus jars and

53:56.000 --> 54:01.160
when I looked at them I could only think of one thing I thought of DDR and I'm

54:01.160 --> 54:04.600
going to post this link in the chat room there so you guys can pull up that

54:04.600 --> 54:07.200
picture yourself if you want to look because I took that picture of my cell

54:07.200 --> 54:11.480
phone now when you look at this does anyone else think Gomlund a couple right

54:11.480 --> 54:17.000
here this whole set you want to know how much they wanted for this three-piece

54:17.000 --> 54:25.000
set $55 I wanted it though you don't don't I was thinking about it just just

54:25.000 --> 54:28.320
to have that sad little you know gum with a couple joke wouldn't that have

54:28.320 --> 54:36.440
been funny anyway huh moving on we're gonna open up our skype line in a little

54:36.440 --> 54:39.820
bit but first I want to talk about some DDR news going on right now did you know

54:39.820 --> 54:46.560
boys and girls that there is a brand new DDR game coming out but it's probably

54:46.560 --> 54:53.040
something you will never ever ever be able to afford. It's actually a DDR fitness game.

54:53.040 --> 54:57.560
So Mel, if you don't mind, I'm sorry, you're having a side conversation there, I'm totally

54:57.560 --> 55:03.360
interrupting. Tell us a little more about the DDR fitness project. What's going on here?

55:03.360 --> 55:08.520
Alright, well just to give like a quick background on how it all came about and such, there was

55:08.520 --> 55:13.840
a convention about two or three weeks ago called the IHRSA, which is like the International

55:13.840 --> 55:18.560
Health Racquetball Sports Association. I know there's like an international racquetball

55:18.560 --> 55:22.960
association out there but that said they have like an expo every year and it usually showcases

55:22.960 --> 55:27.760
a lot of stuff in fitness so there's often a lot of like fitness equipment like treadmills,

55:27.760 --> 55:32.880
exercise machines, uh they have a lot of people like GNC they go out there and they

55:32.880 --> 55:37.120
promote their vitamins that kind of stuff so basically the whole thing is a bunch of

55:37.120 --> 55:41.680
people running around in spandex that's what the convention is no but see the thing is you might

55:41.680 --> 55:44.680
think that's bad but you're thinking you know from an anime con standpoint these

55:44.680 --> 55:48.640
people work out and take care of themselves it's not a bad thing

55:48.640 --> 55:56.840
cinema man say essentially well Konami actually had a booth there and Konami's

55:56.840 --> 56:02.320
booth was actually a Konami Tokyo sports division and they actually do stuff like

56:02.320 --> 56:06.480
tread day actually Konami does a sports line of equipment they do treadmills

56:06.480 --> 56:09.800
they do like weight machines stuff it's actually kind of neat just you know

56:09.800 --> 56:12.760
shortly they do stuff that's like computerized so like if you have a

56:12.760 --> 56:15.860
treadmill you can actually like have a screen in front of you where you can

56:15.860 --> 56:19.440
like surf the web you can like watch satellite TV there's really neat things

56:19.440 --> 56:23.560
that it actually has a computer chip that you wear around your wrist where

56:23.560 --> 56:26.320
you can go around like all a bunch of different machines in one gym and it'll

56:26.320 --> 56:30.280
actually track how many calories you've been burning along the way with all the

56:30.280 --> 56:33.740
different machines. Konami does a lot more than people think. Konami is not just

56:33.740 --> 56:37.060
about you know DDR in Castlevania there's a lot more to Konami they

56:37.060 --> 56:46.060
And when I go to the casino, I always see slot machines that were done by Konami, and that just trips me out, because I always think of Konami as, oh, you know, DDR and Gradius, right?

56:46.060 --> 56:51.060
But Konami does a lot more than people think sometimes.

56:51.060 --> 56:56.380
yeah sports is like their big uh... thing over in japan and uh... well game

56:56.380 --> 56:59.640
more towards relevant stuff i guess they were actually showcasing something

56:59.640 --> 57:04.940
called um... ddr studio which is basically sort of like

57:04.940 --> 57:08.740
what ddr could be in a uh... fitness club type atmosphere obviously there

57:08.740 --> 57:10.420
are limitations with

57:10.420 --> 57:13.860
a home console where as like xbox you can only play up to four people you know

57:13.860 --> 57:17.020
well what if like you want to have a whole bunch of people going out there

57:17.020 --> 57:20.980
so there's uh... this program that they showed

57:20.980 --> 57:23.140
how it worked was

57:23.140 --> 57:24.160
you have like

57:24.160 --> 57:25.500
wireless pads

57:25.500 --> 57:29.100
and you can play up to like eight players you know on this um... demo

57:29.100 --> 57:31.220
and what it is is

57:31.220 --> 57:35.060
uh... you have like one instructor up front kinda like in any other aerobics class

57:35.060 --> 57:37.840
they'd be giving you like showing off the routine so

57:37.840 --> 57:41.140
there would be a game of DDR going but more so instead of paying attention to the screen and

57:41.140 --> 57:43.580
looking at the arrows and you know timing your steps like

57:43.580 --> 57:45.660
we all do just cause we're

57:45.660 --> 57:47.460
like all conditioned for DDR

57:47.460 --> 57:50.040
they actually take you through a routine which is almost like

57:50.040 --> 57:53.880
for all intents and purposes. It's like freestyle, only they're teaching it to you along the way.

57:53.880 --> 57:57.500
And they do all different types of programs with it. It's really neat. They do stuff like

57:57.500 --> 58:01.320
stretching programs, like there's one that's like yoga, tai chi type stuff,

58:01.320 --> 58:04.600
where you go into like different poses and you hold freezes and such.

58:04.600 --> 58:08.240
And then they do stuff that's a little more advanced, like they do like a Muay Thai kickboxing

58:08.240 --> 58:09.160
type thing.

58:09.160 --> 58:11.200
So in a way it's almost sort of like

58:11.200 --> 58:15.560
martial beat, only like a lot less weird, I guess.

58:15.560 --> 58:19.280
I thought that was interesting. The story that you posted over on DDR Free kind of

58:19.280 --> 58:21.900
talks about a little and if people want to see the story of course head on over

58:21.900 --> 58:24.900
to ddrfreak.com they have more information there it's their top story

58:24.900 --> 58:28.780
right now. It talks about that there's actually additional symbols like

58:28.780 --> 58:33.220
there's stars and stuff that are used. In addition like you have the way the

58:33.220 --> 58:36.540
graphic interface is set up is you basically have the step gauge in the

58:36.540 --> 58:41.660
center of the screen and on to the sides of it they have like players one through

58:41.660 --> 58:45.180
eight like one through like the odds on one side the evens on the other and it

58:45.180 --> 58:49.720
It tracks your how many calories you burn just like in workout mode in DDR.

58:49.720 --> 58:56.220
On top of that what it does is the additional symbols you have is a fist that you see coming

58:56.220 --> 59:00.360
up and the fist will either say L or R. So when that comes up to the step gauge that's

59:00.360 --> 59:04.160
your the step zone that's your cue to throw a left punch or a right punch.

59:04.160 --> 59:07.120
It's variant of course obviously by the routine sometimes there'll be a jab sometimes there'll

59:07.120 --> 59:08.200
be an uppercut.

59:08.200 --> 59:12.700
It's dictated by the actual workout routine itself and then there's one that's a star

59:12.700 --> 59:18.700
So it's really trying to take this DDR being a fitness thing and taking it one step further, really.

59:18.700 --> 59:29.700
They're creating ninjas! They're creating ninjas, people! Don't you see? Ninjas! Kicking and punching, what more do we need? They're ninjas!

59:29.700 --> 59:33.460
they're creating it yet people don't you think

59:33.460 --> 59:38.980
kicking and punching what more do we need to make that

59:38.980 --> 59:42.860
twenty-four-hour ninjas coming soon near you uh... to uh... with our fitness

59:42.860 --> 59:43.740
theory of

59:43.740 --> 59:49.620
uh... that like eight times uh... three ninjas the movie

59:49.620 --> 59:51.740
uh... luminous while while

59:51.740 --> 59:55.220
uh... though but i mean i get a lot of people

59:55.220 --> 59:57.020
and i think the premise of it

59:57.020 --> 59:59.380
the cool thing i noticed about like the hardware is

59:59.380 --> 01:00:02.300
no i think they're using wireless pads but the pads that you see out there

01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:05.080
aren't really like the consumer want to see which are like

01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:06.720
kind of the vinyl over

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.960
and that that you know the foldable soft pads

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:11.640
that he is uh... somewhat semi-hard pad

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:14.680
what is it so i like to use a hard rubber which is kind of like

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:17.600
with the use in car floor mats

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:20.080
pretty worried it's very durable actually

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:21.800
and i'll take that they said

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:25.420
that one that's only wireless as more like a bluetooth type infrared

01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:27.320
type technology that they used

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:30.760
So that was just another tidbit of that.

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.320
And I actually work with PS2.

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:34.640
So if there was a way I could ever actually get my hands on

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:35.880
that, I'd so be there.

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:40.760
But the thing about, I guess, what a lot of people are

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:43.880
commenting is, a lot of people, especially in the

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:45.880
just online community, are saying like, great, where's

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:46.800
our arcade mix?

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:47.880
Boohoo, no one cares.

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:49.240
You're like, this is fitness.

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:50.520
The last thing we need to see is this.

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:53.280
It's like, the way I see it right now, if Konami's arcade

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:56.760
division does not want to go in the route of Dance Dance

01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:59.620
Revolution and I've obviously they don't want to do something in America

01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:04.220
This is their only alternate route because if they keep targeting the same gamers, you know

01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:10.020
Like at you know on the consumer level, you know that number may or may not grow very much

01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:13.280
Yeah, I mean that this is at the point where I think DDR is almost topped out

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:18.020
I mean, it's not to say it can't get any better, but there's not much room left, you know, I

01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:25.020
I do think, Loki's got a comment. Let's hope to God that they have these pads at E3 instead of the crappy soft pads.

01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:28.020
All mentioned after Jason.

01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:34.020
What I'm kinda, you know, I really, really wish that they would be doing a new DDR arcade mix.

01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:40.020
I mean, but I don't see this as a bad thing at all because any exposure additional for DDR is gonna be pretty cool.

01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:43.020
It's gonna benefit us all as fans of the game in the long run.

01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:45.020
So I don't see where you can sit there and go, you know,

01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:49.060
you know, oh, this sucks! You know, because it doesn't suck. I mean, it's kind of cool.

01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:53.580
It's a different direction for DDR. But, you know, yeah, I get kind of sad that, you know,

01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:57.540
there's not going to be an arcade mix anytime soon. But, Starxgirl, you have a comment.

01:01:57.540 --> 01:02:02.060
The other thing is that by bringing it into a gym, it kind of legitimizes it a little

01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:06.020
bit versus that crazy game that all the gamers play. It's like, oh, hey, it's something that

01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:10.620
other people who may not play games for any other reason can go and do. So it kind of

01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:15.500
makes it less of a bastard stepchild in a way, and brings it back into the forefront

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:19.460
and can definitely bring some new people into it.

01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:23.620
I mean, they're going for the right target audience right now. Like I said, you're going

01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:27.420
for a whole new audience, bringing them into DDR. You're bringing people who are fitness

01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:33.420
goers, because when we were displaying it off at the convention, there were still people

01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:37.040
who had never heard of it. There were still people who were totally alien to them. They

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:41.200
get on it and next you know they're finding that it's you know a nice fun challenging

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:46.080
game and they're thinking about their nieces and nephews so it's you know we're the company

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:50.000
itself is still promoting DDR we're just going a little bit of a roundabout way to you know

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.200
a new set of people.

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:57.960
If you're a non-gamer adult that has that doesn't have children you probably have never

01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:03.080
heard of DDR honestly because either your kids showed you what DDR was or you're a gamer

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:07.320
adult like most of us are here and you've found DDR on your own, but if you're a non-gamer

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:12.140
adult I can totally see how you've never heard of DDR, honestly. Especially if you're a gym

01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:16.140
bunny and you don't have time to go to the arcades, so it makes sense.

01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:17.140
No comment.

01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:25.340
But, DDR Studio, it's actually a pretty fun game. I actually got to try it out myself.

01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:28.700
When you go through a whole DDR Studio, like the demo that they did, it was about like

01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:34.740
25 minutes straight of DDR of like working out and it was a lot of it was

01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:42.860
pretty hectic and I nothing says like strenuous like boxing to kakumei that's I

01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:46.580
gotta see this I'm really curious of anybody in this area is gonna get it

01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:49.940
because I just I want to see it it sounds kind of neat do I can we expect

01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:54.300
to see pictures or they can do a website for it or anything a promos a lot of

01:03:54.300 --> 01:04:11.300
Some of the songs I noticed were from Beatmania-type songs, but the one I definitely remember was on Kakumei. I think one was something from Beatmania 6.

01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:14.300
Wait, are there songs in this that have not been in DDR yet?

01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:18.300
Yeah, there are some that are pretty new.

01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:19.300
Huh.

01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:22.740
outside trying to like get a bunch of stuff from jason about it

01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:25.100
uh... but thing is it's like

01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:26.040
you know they're

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:28.780
can always not going to be willing to give us any video footage so i'm just

01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:31.420
trying to get either like a press release or just get some stills i know

01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:33.640
they were doing stills on

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:35.960
that day and i would've brought my ditch camp but

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:40.120
uh... you know what may have been able to that's very surprising i just assume

01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:43.300
that they had taken like max to and converted it

01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:47.300
for their with all those things on that one area that i think it is new state

01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:51.020
home release at some point of something like this because you know you're gonna get people

01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:56.500
that are, hey this is kind of fun, oh hey I can do this at home too. You know? I'm sure

01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:57.500
that's the direction they want to go.

01:04:57.500 --> 01:05:00.580
It would be a pretty smart marketing round, definitely.

01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:03.580
The other interesting thing to see on that line would be if they make it like, you know

01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:06.780
how they have those Atari things where you just plug in a joystick and it's like all

01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:10.580
the old school Atari games. Because adults who aren't gamers don't have any other reason

01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:14.960
to get a Playstation or Xbox and that just makes the system a heck of a lot more expensive.

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:18.100
just like some sort of standalone thing where you plug it in and plug the pad in and you're

01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:19.100
ready to go.

01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:20.100
That's actually a really smart idea.

01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:25.060
You've seen those DDR, you can see these at the mall, they suck, they're shitty little

01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:26.060
things.

01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:28.060
I saw that on the freaking Avon kiosk.

01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:30.300
Midi songs, they're horrible.

01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:32.460
My sister bought that for my nephew.

01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:37.860
Was it the one that has Survivor by Destiny's Child?

01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:43.740
Yeah, that's how it goes.

01:05:43.740 --> 01:06:02.020
was basically it yes it's basically playing DDR on the Game Boy well it'll

01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:04.340
be interesting to see what develops of this I'm now you've got me all

01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:07.740
interested with that song list because it makes me think hmm could the songs

01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:12.420
they're using in this be something we see in the next home release I don't

01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:17.420
I'll keep talking to the contacts and get what I can.

01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:19.420
Sounds good. Sounds good. All right.

01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:22.420
So, does this have an official name yet?

01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:25.420
It's called DDR Studio. Basically, it's out in Japan.

01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:30.420
Right now it's patent pending in America right now, because essentially that's what we were doing at the convention.

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:36.420
We were pitching the idea to a bunch of people who were managers of fitness clubs and such.

01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:41.420
Essentially, if they garner enough interest, then it's something they'll move forward with.

01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:48.420
So it's strictly conceptual on this side of the world, but it's very much reality elsewhere.

01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:53.420
You know, if this does show up at my local gym, I am definitely going a lot more.

01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:55.420
Oh, hell yeah.

01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:59.420
I would go much more as well, so it'd be interesting.

01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:02.420
Might be motivation for me to get my fat ass up and exercise.

01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:06.420
And, Loki, good excuse for you to ruin more panels.

01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:08.420
Everything comes up for you.

01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:12.700
What the hell is going on here? Jonas just showed up and he brought a PSP as well.

01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:16.980
And he brought us dinner. It's only because he came last week when we were doing the show.

01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:22.500
Yeah, that's kinda sad. Alright, anyway. Don't you feel like the odd child left out that doesn't have a PSP?

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:28.540
You're so not cool. I am not cool, actually. We're gonna open up the Skype line in a little bit, but first

01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:29.860
a couple of quick things.

01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:34.900
Sharkskroll, I actually, speaking of PSP, you have an interesting story about

01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:37.920
yeah how how the PSP can

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:42.380
can sometimes take your place the PSP the DS

01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:46.060
anything did you want to talk about you don't have to talk about this but

01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:50.060
have the story now yes have the story now okay so I have

01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:54.540
I have a friend I gotta stop you for real quick here

01:07:54.540 --> 01:07:58.580
Jonas just walked in with a loving lamb

01:07:58.580 --> 01:08:01.980
and a ball gag an inflatable

01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:03.980
Um, sex lamb and a ball gag.

01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:05.980
Jonas, Jonas, hi Jonas.

01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:08.980
Jonas, come here, come here, get on the mic, Jonas.

01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:14.980
I'm sorry sharks girl, but um, when inflatable lambs and ball gags are brought into play,

01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:18.980
I don't give a shit about your PSP story anymore, I hope you'll understand.

01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:20.980
Alright, love ya.

01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:28.980
Jonas, now, remind me, you went, you went 40 days with no boner for Lent, right?

01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:29.980
Yeah.

01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:35.260
Okay, how do you go from no boner for 40 days to bringing-

01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:36.260
I survived.

01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:37.760
How do you go from the-

01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:42.620
You are Easter-eyed fucking soldier!

01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:45.660
Islander is just finding this out for the first time.

01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:54.260
Jonas, how do you go from being Mr. No Boner, for lack of a better term, to bringing to

01:08:54.260 --> 01:09:00.900
to this show, which has nothing to do with sex, last time I checked, an inflatable lamb

01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:03.100
and a ball gag. Please explain.

01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:10.660
Okay, for those who don't notice, I just turned 22 yesterday, and a lot of people gave me

01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:13.140
some sex stuff, so...

01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:17.820
So why did you bring it here? Did you think that we, did you think, oh god, it's the,

01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:21.820
you know, it's the last episode of Orange Lounge in that studio, let's all fuck a sheep!

01:09:21.820 --> 01:09:23.820
Let's do it!

01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:34.820
You know what? If Dark Sakura gets too angsty tonight, we'll just shove this ball in her mouth!

01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:37.820
You know what? Fuck that!

01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:47.820
Jonas, I don't know what to do with you sometimes.

01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:49.820
Alright, anyway, back to Sharks Girl.

01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:52.820
Alright, yes, please, back to Sharks Girl.

01:09:52.820 --> 01:09:55.820
I'm sorry, Sharks Girl, but I had to go there.

01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:59.820
And you know what's funny is that's just, like, so par for the course for this story.

01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:03.820
Better than being hijacked by Loki's pants.

01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:09.820
Anyway, please, your story about the DS, PSP, etc.

01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:13.820
Okay, I have a friend who is not of any of the circles that anyone knows.

01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:15.820
He moved away, he moved back, long story.

01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:20.200
so I've been hanging out with him pretty often because he lives in Fremont now

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:23.560
and works at Dave and Buster's so maybe we can all harass him on Saturday if

01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:28.480
he's working that would be fun we could we could have fun with that and he works

01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:35.280
in the dining room we can really harass him at any rate um yes I said harass

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:42.880
I'll say it again to harass harass harass there are you happy and I wonder

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:55.840
harass. Harass. Harass the pants. Anyway, so I'm known for being a bit of the gadget

01:10:55.840 --> 01:11:03.000
junkie if it's cool and a new toy I want it so I have the iPod I almost ended up

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.840
with the second iPod last weekend I have the PSP I have the DS I have all the fun

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:12.840
You're a Veruca game! I want it and I want it now, Daddy!

01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:13.840
Yeah, yeah, pretty much.

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:14.840
She is a consumer whore.

01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:15.840
And how!

01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:17.840
Anyway, sorry, I keep interrupting.

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:21.840
So I, um, meet up with said friend and show him,

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:23.840
Oh look, I got this nifty new Nintendo DS.

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:28.840
He has proceeded to yell at me if I don't bring the DS with me every time I see him now.

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:33.840
So then, he told me not to get a PSP and I ignored him and got a PSP anyway.

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:38.240
And so I said oh look what I got a PSP and now all he wants to do is play the PSP

01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:45.420
so yes my friends I have gone from being seen for just you know my loving charming self as a

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:49.440
Excuse to get to play DS and a PSP and he gets pissed off when I don't bring him

01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:54.760
So I've decided to screw that especially when he destroyed two of my games. I found out when I tried to sell them. Whoa

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:57.280
Yeah, I lent him to

01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:02.360
What did I lend him to PS 2 games and they were perfect pristine?

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:04.640
And now they're scratched to the point that the place won't buy them back

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:12.600
So I'm being used for video games. Isn't that fun? I was I'm not even rich, and I don't really have all the new stuff, but

01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:17.040
When I was younger, I was not rich, and I didn't have all the cool toys

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:21.460
I still had kids that would come over and only be my friend because I had you know Super Nintendo

01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:24.300
Yeah, it's really kind of middle school. I'm kind of tired of it

01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:27.760
So I just stopped bringing him or telling him and and he gets pissed off that I don't bring him

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:30.000
I'm like oh guess what fuck you don't care

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Alright.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:37.000
So, that's why I showed you my PSP the minute I walked in, because you're cool and I love you.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Aww, thank you.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000
And of course, you show it to me and what do I do? Oh, I already played that.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Well fine then!

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:51.000
So yes, lesson of the story, don't use your friends for their video games, it's not cool.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Alright.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:58.160
Anyway, we are going to open up the Skype line so you guys can call in because I'm sure

first caller hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Dennis Alcom here. Yes my friend

01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:29.080
what's on your mind? Let me see just the comments and how you know DDR is taking a

01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:34.840
new path in just basically instead of focusing on more of the gameplay just

01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:40.600
focusing on on the exercise it's a step in another direction exactly that's what

01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:46.720
I said it's kind of like another branch in the road okay and so I mean I don't I

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:49.560
mean I still I still have hopes that they're gonna make another arcade mix

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:55.080
but I don't expect that you know I'm not so fixated on the fact that it is but in

01:15:55.080 --> 01:16:01.200
reality it might be possible. I'm trying not to lose hope over it. No, but think

01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:04.360
about it. Logistically it's possible because they could do it through a

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:08.380
third party. Like Betzen is their, as you know, Betzen is their

01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:14.880
official, you know, distributor. Okay. So if they ever wanted to make a

01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:18.360
mix in America and they needed to distribute, you know, to bring it out

01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:25.560
there they could use them to distribute that's an idea I mean we're not president

01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:28.680
we're not presidents of Konami distribution or anything so we would know

01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:34.560
but you never know so it's an option yeah it's right there in place because

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:38.080
even though they shut down their American operations they can still make

01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:41.960
the cabinets in Japan and ship them over here you know assuming they have a

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:50.000
distributor okay yeah but you know I'm just you know I don't know I mean this

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.640
whole DDR studio thing yeah it sounds promising I just hope that you know it

01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:59.200
could just make DDR you know not something that would over kill

01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:03.640
the exposure but just something that would get it that would make it

01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:08.960
known to almost the average Joe because the average Joe six-pack won't even know

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:17.960
Well, you know, as we were saying earlier, even, you can't complain about DDR Studio because, of course, like what, the third reply in that thread was,

01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:21.960
Fuck this game! We want new Konami arcade stuff! You can't really-

01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:23.960
I want it in the green studio!

01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:32.960
Yeah, yeah. Don't even let me go there yet. Okay. But, any new DDR is going to be good for the scene as a whole because it's more exposure.

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:37.960
Exactly. You know, Konami's probably playing it both ways.

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:42.960
Trying to appease the scene that pretty much built DDR in this country,

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:49.960
and then trying to do their own thing by trying to branch out and focus on one aspect of DDR.

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:51.960
Okay, alright.

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:57.960
It's kind of like that. Yeah, they're playing both ways. That's pretty much what Konami's doing.

01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:05.680
So, I have, you know, pretty much, we don't even know whether or not there's going to be another mix in the fall, or something like that, or in the near future.

01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:10.160
Well, we do know that there is one thing that's going to be shown at E3 this year, for sure.

01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:11.240
Obviously, TDR with Mario.

01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:16.760
Yeah, TDR with Mario is definitely going to be shown at E3. IGN leaked that one earlier this week. We know about that, so.

01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:21.280
But what is Konami going to do to follow up Extreme and UltraMix 2? Tell me that.

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:26.080
Well, the assumption is something is coming. They can't just leave us hanging with that, but...

01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:33.080
They could probably, I don't know, I could just throw it out there and they probably could pour party collection to this country and then basically, you know, shoot themselves in the foot.

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:44.080
Well, nah, I, nah, bah, bah, bah, bah, because DDR Extreme was such a radical departure from DDR Extreme in Japan, wouldn't you logically think that we're going to get something brand new?

01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:46.080
They're not going to port us something over? We're going to get something new?

01:18:46.080 --> 01:19:00.080
I just, I don't even know what the Japanese, you know, whatever's left of the DDR scene over there, I mean, you know, the whole, whoever still plays there actually thinks of the new songs that were actually made for UltraMix, you know, and UltraMix 2.

01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:11.080
It's really hard to see what they think, and how, you know, this is based, you know, on how UltraMix 2, and how we managed to make our own mix, something that, you know, American DDR players could call their own.

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:24.080
Oh yeah, I agree. The recent U.S. mixes have far surpassed their Japanese song list arguments aside, I mean, Big Boo Hoo, Cartoon Heroes hasn't been released in the U.S. now.

01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:29.080
The games themselves have surpassed Big Boo Hoo, Aqua Suck.

01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:37.080
What they lacked in like, you know, popular songs from DDR Extreme, they made up for with brand new ones from 2DX and other Bamani.

01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:47.080
So you can't argue with that, that they're actually branching out into 2DX and really, you know, really, they're branching out into Bomani that these DDR players are most likely to play.

01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:51.080
Alright, someone who's been on the inside wants to comment. Hold on, hold on, Taku, hold on.

01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:59.080
I was just, I mean, I might be a minute or two behind, but I was hearing something about how, like, the US can break out into their own as far as, like, DDR goes.

01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:08.080
I think that's what was the intention of when Konami of Hawaii was basically assigned to do UltraMix and basically the whole Xbox series.

01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:17.080
I mean the reason why I think UltraMix 2 was the way it was, was because it was essentially there was a lot of feedback from the American audience.

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:22.080
Right! Hell, we even made the steps for the songs.

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:23.080
Who's we?

01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:26.020
we are going to get back to the only way we can do it

01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:29.780
i don't know if we have it with dvd our players

01:20:29.780 --> 01:20:35.680
it mean you know i don't have a job they're going to let you let them and

01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:38.280
they're going to let them in a different uh... i mean you know it

01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:40.500
you know i mean it's looking but its

01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:42.640
to say that's going to be the end of it

01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:45.800
no not quite you know i don't think that that's the story i doubt it i mean

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:49.020
they just wanted to tell you know like we're gonna let you telegraph or doing

01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:50.720
six months down the road whatever

01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:56.720
And, you know, in all fairness, I don't even work for the company anymore, but, you know.

01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:06.720
But I just want to trip. I mean, it's like, if you really want to, you know, basically have power as far as, like, dictate what Konami does, buy 51% of their stock.

01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:12.720
Half of their stock? I don't even know if that's available, but at 20 bucks a pop, that's a lot, man.

01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:16.720
Alright. Saku, we gotta let you go because other people are trying to get in, but thank you so much for calling. Have a good one.

01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:17.720
Okay.

01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:24.720
Alright. Alright. So, you know, again, to sum that one up, any exposure for DDR is going to be a good thing.

01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:34.220
And the U.S. definitely breaking out into their own with UltraMix 2, and DDR Extreme being so radically different from its Japanese counterpart this year.

01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:36.720
Let's take another call. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:38.720
Hey, Sky. It's El Mullet.

01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:40.720
Hello, El Mullet. What's on your mind, buddy?

01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:44.720
Ah, just, this is one hell of a show you got going on right now.

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:52.240
It's always these shows where we come in and honestly, I'm gonna be honest like five minutes before the show started tonight. I was just gone

01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:55.760
Let's just get this over with I have a headache

01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:59.000
I want to get through this show so I can go back to bed and

01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:05.660
Now it's like why is it whenever I approach the show with that attitude the shows end up being just chaotic funness

01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:08.840
Well, I'm glad you approach things with a bland attitude sky

01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:11.840
It makes it greater for the rest of us.

01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:16.960
Aren't the rest of you so comfortable knowing that I approached this show with such a positive

01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:17.960
attitude?

01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:21.160
Oh yeah, let's do this again.

01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:22.160
What's on your mind, Elmoley?

01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:28.160
Well, I recently came into Beatmania 2DX 9th style, and I've been having a ball with that.

01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:31.560
I don't know if that's good to do to a machine, but okay.

01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:32.880
Just stop it, Loki.

01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:33.880
Just stop it.

01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:35.880
Loki, you already lost this show.

01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:45.880
I'm sorry Elmo, I apologize for Loki's behavior.

01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:49.880
Nah, don't. At least I get to burn on him once before you go to your next studio.

01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:53.880
We're not dying. We are starting over.

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:54.880
Good for you.

01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:55.880
It's new.

01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:58.880
Alright.

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:01.880
Alright, so what else is on your mind Elmo?

01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:02.880
You got 9th style.

01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:10.120
I got 9 style, and I do have a PSP now, and I do have Lumines for it, and I do have a

01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:13.440
couple other games that are currently collecting dust.

01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:17.920
I would like to make a note that currently there are at least three or four PSPs in this

01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:21.500
room, and I think at least three of them are playing Lumines.

01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:23.500
As they should.

01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:24.880
Amen.

01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:31.580
It's the one game that I can honestly say is the only reason right now that a PSP should

01:23:31.580 --> 01:23:36.920
be bought right now. Well, I'm kind of waiting for PopCap to rip it off like they do all

01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:41.880
the other puzzle games, so that I can play Luminous online. But they'll probably call

01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:48.380
it, you know, Force or Magic Squares, or, you know. Musical Squares. Musical Squares

01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:53.060
or something, you know. You know PopCap.com, they rip off all the good puzzle games and

01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:55.780
make their own version. I'm gonna tell them that name. I'm gonna go to PopCap and say,

01:23:55.780 --> 01:23:57.780
I have a title for your luminous rip-off.

01:23:57.780 --> 01:23:58.780
There you go.

01:23:58.780 --> 01:23:59.780
Give me money.

01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:00.780
Alright.

01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:06.780
And we could call it Puzzle Pants as some post-it show rumor.

01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:08.780
Oh boy.

01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:09.780
Anyway.

01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:13.580
What do you think about the whole DDR stuff at E3 this year?

01:24:13.580 --> 01:24:14.580
What do you think we're going to see?

01:24:14.580 --> 01:24:18.980
We know that we're going to be seeing DDR with Mario, per the earlier Orange Entree report

01:24:18.980 --> 01:24:24.180
that said IGN blew the lid on that, and that we are going to see DDR with Mario at E3.

01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:26.820
What do you think else is in store for us at E3?

01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:30.440
I think we're going to see PS2 and Xbox iterations.

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:34.520
We didn't know it was coming in 2002 when DDR Max was announced.

01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:39.760
We didn't know anything was coming in 2003 when Max 2, well, we knew Max 2 was coming,

01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:42.260
but we didn't know UltraMix was coming.

01:24:42.260 --> 01:24:47.120
We didn't know UltraMix 2 was coming even though we knew Extreme was coming in 2004.

01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:50.660
We don't know anything outside of DDR with Mario for right now.

01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:53.420
We can rest assured we're going to see some new iterations.

01:24:53.420 --> 01:24:57.920
I stake my career on it, as in quasi-internet celebrity.

01:24:57.920 --> 01:24:59.920
Ooh, okay.

01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:01.920
You heard it here first.

01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:05.920
If you don't see any new PS2 or Xbox games, I will retire forever.

01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:08.920
Oh, wow, that's some strong words there.

01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:11.920
You better hope I lose this archive if that does turn out to be true.

01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:12.920
No, I am actually with you.

01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:16.920
I'm not going to stake my internet celebrity on it because I don't have much to wager,

01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:19.920
but I do think we are going to see new PS2 and Xbox misses.

01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:20.920
I think it's inevitable.

01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:24.280
Well, I don't have much to wager either, but there are people that want to see me retire,

01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:25.280
I'm sure.

01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:26.280
All right.

01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:27.280
Your website, Elmoit.

01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:28.280
Let us know.

01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:29.280
Insidepulse.com.

01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:30.280
All right.

01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:31.280
Visit it.

01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:32.280
Love it.

01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:33.280
You haven't had a new column in a while.

01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:34.280
That's true.

01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:35.280
The school's been getting in the way.

01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:36.280
I've been taking on some new duties.

01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:40.720
I'm the news editor now, which means I have full control over the news board, which is

01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:46.920
why our news board is so kick-ass right now, and I might be coming into some more...

01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:49.420
I've actually been working on a feature.

01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:53.420
And believe it or not, it's an in-the-groove-related feature.

01:25:53.420 --> 01:25:55.500
Shock!

01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:59.700
I'm very curious to see what happens, because I know your feelings on in-the-groove, and

01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:00.700
I'm just kind of...

01:26:00.700 --> 01:26:06.760
Right, my feelings aside, this is more of a quasi-promotional piece, let's say, because

01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:10.700
I got an interview with someone in Red Octane, they were nice enough to answer some questions

01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:17.740
I had, and doing an official ignition pad review, they were nice enough to supply me

01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:23.820
with the pad, considering that's going to be the basic controller they're offering for

01:26:23.820 --> 01:26:25.740
this game. So how does it hold up?

01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:31.460
Oh, well, we'll see. We'll have to check that out when the article comes out. So keep an

01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:33.380
eye on InsidePulse.com.

01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:38.140
It should be out sometime this week if I can get every...if I can...if everything goes

01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:39.780
well, everything's on time and such.

01:26:39.780 --> 01:26:42.060
All right. Well, Mullen, I'm going to let you go so I can take another call. But thanks

01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:43.340
so much for calling in. Have a good one, okay?

01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:44.340
No problem.

01:26:44.340 --> 01:26:45.340
All right.

01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:46.340
You too.

01:26:46.340 --> 01:26:47.340
Later.

01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:52.340
You know, I always expect El Mullet to come in with, like, a guitar strum like El Cabong.

01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:56.340
Hold on. We're gonna go to another call here. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:26:56.340 --> 01:26:59.340
Oh, well, we'll see. We'll have to check that out when the, uh...

01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:05.340
Oh, whoa, turn down your volume there. First rule of radio. Turn down the volume, because we're hearing ourselves there.

01:27:05.340 --> 01:27:07.340
Hello. Are you there?

01:27:07.340 --> 01:27:10.340
Everything goes well with everything going sorry.

01:27:10.340 --> 01:27:12.340
All right, well, El Mullet, I'd like to go take you to that call today.

01:27:12.340 --> 01:27:16.340
Can't hear him. I can hear myself, though, and I must say I sound sexy.

01:27:16.340 --> 01:27:19.340
Um, you gotta check your mic, buddy. We can't hear you. Sorry.

01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:20.340

Oops, I just hung up on somebody else. I meant to hang up on that one. Yeah?

01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:26.340

Wait, oh. Is somebody there? Oh, we got him. Hi. You're on Orson's Radio.

Ooh, Canada. What's that about? What is it?

01:27:36.340 --> 01:27:38.340
Oh, not much, you know. Weather's been really nice.

and a half two years now just want to thank you guys for doing the show it's

01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:13.020
That's really awesome, and I'd have nothing to do on Sunday night.

01:28:13.020 --> 01:28:18.020
Well, there's always desperate housewives, but it kind of sucks.

01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:22.020
Do you get desperate housewives in Canada? I hope you don't.

01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:29.020
Something else I can really think of, you guys are quite awesome, and just keep up with this,

01:28:29.020 --> 01:28:31.020
and good luck with the move and everything.

01:28:31.020 --> 01:28:33.020
All right, no problem. Thank you for calling in.

01:28:33.020 --> 01:28:35.020
Thanks for being a cool listener.

01:28:35.020 --> 01:28:37.020
Yes, we like compliments and inflate our ego.

01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:41.020
By the way, Rob, I love the fact how you're waving goodbye.

01:28:41.020 --> 01:28:43.020
Thanks, I'll sign off now. Keep going with it.

01:28:43.020 --> 01:28:44.020
Alright, later.

01:28:44.020 --> 01:28:47.020
Wow, I think he couldn't hear us.

01:28:47.020 --> 01:28:48.020
We're big in Canada.

01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:52.020
Alright, yeah, it's nice to know we're big in Canada. We have an international following.

01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:57.020
I need to visit Canada again. It's been a little while since I've been to Canada. I'd like to go back and visit.

01:28:57.020 --> 01:29:00.020
Alright, let's go to another call. Hi, you're on Orange Island Radio.

01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:03.020
Just so you know, Sky, you have a great voice. I love it.

01:29:03.020 --> 01:29:05.020
Oh, thank you. That's so nice.

01:29:05.020 --> 01:29:09.020
You don't think it's too faggy? You don't think it's too faggy?

01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:13.020
Because a lot of people say I'm too faggy.

01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:14.020
Nah, I don't think so.

01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:17.020
Alright. It's just the way I am, dammit.

01:29:17.020 --> 01:29:19.020
So what if I'm a little nasally?

01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:21.020
We'd love you for it, that's just it.

01:29:21.020 --> 01:29:23.020
Thank you, I appreciate it.

01:29:23.020 --> 01:29:28.020
Sam Kinnison got his career forever with that. Ow! Ow!

01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:30.020
Who is one of my favorite comedians?

01:29:30.020 --> 01:29:32.020
Alright. That explains it there.

01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:33.020
Alright, what's on your mind, buddy?

01:29:33.020 --> 01:29:41.020
Not much. I got a couple of stories for you. I know I told Jamie this one. I call it the PSP to hell.

01:29:43.020 --> 01:29:46.020
What happened was a guy came to return on the PSP.

01:29:46.020 --> 01:29:49.020
Oh, this is brilliant.

01:29:50.020 --> 01:29:55.020
We had none in stock. He's getting all pissed off and all agitated that we have none.

01:29:55.020 --> 01:29:59.020
So customer service tells him, we can give you credit for a new one.

01:29:59.020 --> 01:30:03.660
And he continues to scream about this until the General Manager walks over.

01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:07.580
The General Manager tells him the only thing we can do is give you a refund.

01:30:07.580 --> 01:30:11.460
He's like, fine, I'll take the refund. And he slams his hand

01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:15.340
down on the counter. But it wasn't the counter he hit.

01:30:15.340 --> 01:30:19.340
Uh oh. The screen

01:30:19.340 --> 01:30:23.340
was cracked into pieces.

01:30:23.340 --> 01:30:26.380
Ouch.

01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:29.700
Now I've heard about a couple burnt out pixels or two.

01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:33.020
Stupid! Stupid, stupid, stupid!

01:30:33.020 --> 01:30:34.060
So what ended up happening?

01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:39.540
The general manager told him, can I give you a refund now? And he took a swing at the general manager.

01:30:39.540 --> 01:30:42.700
Oh, I hope you had that boy escorted out.

01:30:42.700 --> 01:30:45.740
By the police, yeah. By the police.

01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:49.300
But what happened was the general manager ducked

01:30:49.300 --> 01:30:52.580
and hit him right in the face and he went out.

01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:57.580
Oh my gosh. Drama at a game store? What the heck?

01:30:57.580 --> 01:31:03.580
Best part is, the general manager was a six foot two tall girl.

01:31:03.580 --> 01:31:05.580
That is awesome.

01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:11.580
Wait a minute. So this guy went to take a swing at a girl over a PSP which he broke himself?

01:31:11.580 --> 01:31:12.580
Yes.

01:31:12.580 --> 01:31:14.580
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

01:31:14.580 --> 01:31:19.580
Huh. Interesting. Let us know when he's out of jail, okay?

01:31:19.580 --> 01:31:22.080
Well yeah, I'll be sure of that.

01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:26.580
If we can get his picture, we'll post it on the website as our loser of the month.

01:31:26.580 --> 01:31:28.080
I'll try.

01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:33.080
Okay. Alright, sounds good. Thank you so much for the call and the story. Anything else on your mind?

01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:37.080
Not really, I'm just watching a backlash of drama and shit, I'll just leave it at that.

01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:38.580
Okay, alright, have fun.

01:31:38.580 --> 01:31:39.580
You too, take care.

01:31:39.580 --> 01:31:40.580
Later, you too.

01:31:40.580 --> 01:31:41.080
Bye.

01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:41.580
Bye.

01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:47.580
Okay, we'll try and get one more call in, at least for now. We'll open it up again a little bit later.

01:31:47.580 --> 01:31:51.280
First, what I want to do though, real quick, before we pick up another call, wait for somebody to get in there.

01:31:51.280 --> 01:32:00.680
Um, if you would be so kind, head on over to podcastally.com and vote for the Orange Lounge Radio to-go edition.

01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:07.180
I'm going to give you guys a direct link there in the chat room, because voting for us brings us up in the rankings there.

01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:13.780
And, uh, a lot of people don't really notice Orange Lounge Radio as a gaming station because, you know, they think Orange Lounge, what the hell is that?

01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:17.640
So, you know, vote for us, it increases us in the rankings, and more people see us, and

01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:20.480
the community grows, and we're all happy.

01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:26.760
And we don't put spam in our podcast feed either, unlike some other feeds, which maybe

01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:28.440
we'll talk about on this week's podcast.

01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:29.440
Let's go to another call.

01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:33.440
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:35.440

01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:12.760
Uh huh.

01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:13.760
You're on Orange Lounge.

01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:14.760
Hello?

01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:15.760
Hello!

01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:16.760
Hey!

01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:17.760
Hey, what's up?

01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:18.760
Ugh!

01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:19.760
It's about damn time!

01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:24.000
I know, it's a crazy li- I apologize to those of you guys not getting through tonight.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:25.000
It's lit up like hell.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:30.560
For- for my part as well, it's my fault too, because you know, I got a little bit late.

01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:32.680
You lucked out, the last guy didn't have his mic up.

01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:34.680
What's uh- what's uh- what's on your mind, buddy?

01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:40.180
Yeah, just helping you out with some Happy Sky song lists that are in Japanese.

01:33:40.180 --> 01:33:41.180
Alright.

01:33:41.180 --> 01:33:46.580
I'm gonna tell it to you, and here it is, the genre is disco, and the artist is a dance

01:33:46.580 --> 01:33:50.220
man featuring disco, and this is kind of a tongue twister.

01:33:50.220 --> 01:33:54.180
The song title is We Are Disco Yotsutachi No Chi.

01:33:54.180 --> 01:33:55.180
Wow.

01:33:55.180 --> 01:33:57.020
That's a mouthful there.

01:33:57.020 --> 01:33:59.900
By the way, your mic is a little bit quiet, anything you can do to make yourself louder

01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:01.620
would be appreciated by the listeners.

01:34:01.620 --> 01:34:02.940
Alright, now it's close.

01:34:02.940 --> 01:34:03.940
There you go.

01:34:03.940 --> 01:34:11.940
Alright, yeah, um, the next one is a J.U. beat by, uh, T.A.T.S, not T.A.T.S, it's T.A.T.S,

01:34:11.940 --> 01:34:15.940
featuring, uh, Hoshino Kanako, and it's, uh, Gekkou.

01:34:15.940 --> 01:34:20.940
And then there's, uh, Funk, which is, uh, by dance, uh, the artist by Danceman, which is, uh,

01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:25.940
Ore wa bito manya, omae wa nani manya, which translates to, uh, I am beat mania.

01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:27.940
You are what mania?

01:34:27.940 --> 01:34:31.940
Ore, you know, Ore is a masculine way of saying I.

01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:38.580
huh I am beat mania you are what mania yeah you are what mania I am beat mania

01:34:38.580 --> 01:34:47.980
you are what no you didn't I am beat mania sorry couldn't help myself and

01:34:47.980 --> 01:34:53.660
then there's a hard dance you know which is a remix of got paisio strong Jega oh

01:34:53.660 --> 01:35:00.820
okay and then there's a you know huh and then a synthetic oh I forgot another

01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:04.820
The genre is Natural Sound and it's by Twin Amadeus.

01:35:04.820 --> 01:35:09.820
Alta Turca Ompassion, you know, W-N, I kind of pronounce it as a O-N.

01:35:09.820 --> 01:35:14.820
And it's very interesting that Alta Turca Ompassion is the remix of the Turkish March.

01:35:14.820 --> 01:35:15.820
Oh, okay.

01:35:15.820 --> 01:35:18.820
The Twin Amadeus version of the Turkish March.

01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:20.820
Ooh, that should be interesting, the old classic song.

01:35:20.820 --> 01:35:23.820
Now, you've been checking out some of the videos, right, from Happy Sky?

01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:24.820
Yeah.

01:35:24.820 --> 01:35:25.820
In fact, I'm going to play a little clip.

01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:29.820
You actually sent me one of Eden, one of the new songs from 12th Style.

01:35:29.820 --> 01:35:33.820
It's my very favorite Tarot song.

01:35:33.820 --> 01:35:37.820
So you can hear a little bit there of what Eden sounds like, the new Tarot song.

01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:41.820
Yeah.

01:35:41.820 --> 01:35:45.820
Lots of double notes in that.

01:35:45.820 --> 01:35:49.820
What else can we look forward to in the Happy Sky videos?

01:35:49.820 --> 01:35:53.820
What else is in those videos that you think is worth sharing with our listeners?

01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:57.820
Well, you already saw Toe Jam. Yeah, I saw the Toe Jam video. That was pretty cool.

01:35:57.820 --> 01:36:01.820
Yeah, I really like the song. It's the first time I've ever heard it.

01:36:01.820 --> 01:36:07.820
You know, while I was listening to the song, I just yelled, YEE-HAW!

01:36:13.820 --> 01:36:19.820
This is coming from the video there. Of course, tempo changes like hell.

01:36:19.820 --> 01:36:21.820
But that's what you'd expect from Sojam.

01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:26.640
it goes from uh... like from a hundred and three to a hundred and sixty bpm

01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:31.480
in a minute sixty bpm is the fastest

01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:33.240
anything else in the videos

01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:35.280
that there's uh...

01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:36.480
what you'll call it

01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:39.040
yeah i don't like that i don't like the

01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:41.520
somehow or they won't be the money on my one anyone yet

01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:43.420
to play

01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:46.980
i don't i don't know if it was a lot of the videos have generics i'm hoping that

01:36:46.980 --> 01:36:50.880
changes before the final really it will have uh... you know actual videos when

01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:55.880
when the final product's been released, just like the same thing happened to BeQuiet.

01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:59.880
That's very true.

01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:00.880
Alright.

01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:01.880
Yeah.

01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:05.880
Okay, well, we're gonna go ahead and let you go, because our Skype line's on fire tonight, but thanks for the 2DX update,

01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:12.880
and the borrowing of your Japanese accent is always appreciated as well from this very white host.

01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:22.880
And so this, and so, let me get my catchphrase first, and so this resident 2DX bastard walks back to the shadows of the Mani style.

01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:24.880
Thank you my friend, have a good one.

01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:25.880
Alright, later.

01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:29.880
I like our callers that have their own taglines, that's pretty funny.

01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:32.880
Alright, maybe we can squeeze in one more call.

01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:34.880
Hi, you're on Orange Long's Radio.

01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:39.880
It's this guy whose mic wasn't working earlier.

01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:45.680
earlier. Can you hear us, buddy? Hello? I know, we still can't hear him. We still can't

01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:54.680
hear you. Turn your mic up or something. Give him a few more seconds. Don't! Let's try another

01:37:54.680 --> 01:37:57.480
call. All right. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

01:37:57.480 --> 01:38:01.880
Hey, it's me. It's Lemon Lime Jump. Hello, Lemon Lime Jump. How are you?

01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:07.480
Hey, I'm, uh, uh, yeah, I'm here. I don't know if, there. Is that better?

01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:09.480
Yes, we can hear you. What's up?

01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:15.480
Um, alright. I just wanted to say, yeah, I don't know why, for some reason I was up early and asked yesterday-

01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:16.480
Hello?

01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:17.480
Hi, we can hear you.

01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:19.480
Oh, okay. Um-

01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:22.480
We're just eagerly anticipating your every word.

01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:25.480
Oh, okay, I'm just- I need to turn off the radio.

01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:28.480
Oh, okay, yeah, definitely turn down the radio because it'll throw you off there a little bit.

01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:31.480
I've got it. Alright, um-

01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:43.480
So I was actually tuned into the Today Show yesterday, and I guess you've probably heard they had that DDR thing on it yesterday. It was just like a little five-minute segment.

01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:46.480
No, I actually didn't hear about DDR on the Today Show. What happened?

01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:54.480
Yeah, I guess they were touting it for its fitness qualities.

01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:57.480
They had some fitness expert come in and try to show it off.

01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:00.480
I think they had a couple of Cobalt flux pads

01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:03.480
plugged into a PS2 or an Xbox or something.

01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:13.480
And the thing I found interesting was that the song that they used for demonstration

01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:19.960
was Mobumoga. And I was thinking, Orange Lounge! Orange Lounge Radio. Oh, that's too cute.

01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:26.000
And then, yeah, my brain works funny. I don't know why. I have to interrupt real fast. Shark

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:30.200
Squirrel has got this funny look on her face. You have to share this. Oh my god, I think

01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:35.400
you're my voice twin. Shark Squirrel and Lemon Lime Jump do sound very similar. It's kind

01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:40.600
of scary. It's like the same mannerisms, same voice, same everything. It's freaky. Everybody

01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:45.520
says I sound like my sister though. It says I don't... Well now there's yeah now there's

01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:49.300
three of you because you got you got a twin on the west coast. Actually there's

01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:55.580
five because my family sounds like me too. Wow that's crazy. Wow I'm sorry you were

01:39:55.580 --> 01:39:58.020
so you were into another thought there before I let sharks girl cut you off

01:39:58.020 --> 01:40:04.100
there. That's right. But it was one thing that irritated me and I guess I don't know

01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:07.300
because they needed something for the folk cameras to focus on anyway they

01:40:07.300 --> 01:40:11.700
demonstrated for like 30 seconds trying to play and then they had the two

01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:16.020
guys talking and they still had the camera focused and they weren't even

01:40:16.020 --> 01:40:19.940
playing anymore so it basically had the camera going boo or the camera focus on

01:40:19.940 --> 01:40:27.300
the two TV screens going boo boo boo boo boo you too can be a DDR expert and I'm

01:40:27.300 --> 01:40:32.020
thinking what choice of camera shots was that I'm not quite sure you know what I

01:40:32.020 --> 01:40:41.240
say to that director fired yeah yeah put on a comb-over you know tell him you're

01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:47.980
fired well thanks for the update because I had no idea that DDR was on the today

01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:51.000
show I somehow completely missed that I wish that somebody would send a little

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:55.800
clip somehow so we could see that so well hopefully that somebody got that

01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:58.780
and we can check that out later and of course if we can find a clip of the

01:40:58.780 --> 01:41:02.780
Today Show, we will do in the great Orange Lounge tradition, we will play it and make

01:41:02.780 --> 01:41:03.780
fun of it.

01:41:03.780 --> 01:41:04.780
So.

01:41:04.780 --> 01:41:05.780
We're cocky.

01:41:05.780 --> 01:41:10.220
Hopefully not in the Today Show, but we'll see.

01:41:10.220 --> 01:41:11.220
You never know.

01:41:11.220 --> 01:41:12.220
They are desperate for ratings.

01:41:12.220 --> 01:41:14.220
It just made me think of, yeah, NBC.

01:41:14.220 --> 01:41:15.220
I know.

01:41:15.220 --> 01:41:16.220
I know.

01:41:16.220 --> 01:41:22.020
Also, if this is, yeah, your last show in the studio, I'm not quite sure how the broadcasting

01:41:22.020 --> 01:41:28.740
works, but you know, I don't know if I'd be broadcasting

01:41:28.740 --> 01:41:33.180
casting a show on my birthday, but I just want to say two days ahead of time, I want

01:41:33.180 --> 01:41:38.420
to say happy birthday to Dark Sakura. We got the same birthday.

01:41:38.420 --> 01:41:39.420
Do you guys really?

01:41:39.420 --> 01:41:41.100
Yeah, I looked it up.

01:41:41.100 --> 01:41:44.920
You and Dark Sakura and Linda Lime Jump have the same birthday, and she's saying happy

01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:45.920
birthday to you.

01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:46.920
Happy birthday to us!

01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:47.920
Yay!

01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:50.920
Because we are so freakin' awesome.

01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:54.460
O tanjou vio medito!

01:41:54.460 --> 01:41:55.460
You're on.

01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:56.460
Yay.

01:41:56.460 --> 01:41:57.460
Oh.

01:41:57.460 --> 01:41:58.460
For a moment, I turned off the microphone.

01:41:58.460 --> 01:42:00.460
Arigato!

01:42:28.460 --> 01:42:32.920
You hear worse on cable TV anyway, so I mean not not the like cursing but like

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Okay, never mind. I'm just

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
Yeah, it's all about looky's pants

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.620
And um for a couple last

01:42:45.140 --> 01:42:49.920

And now you know.

01:43:09.300 --> 01:43:11.820
They're pants.

01:43:11.820 --> 01:43:13.500
Mel had a confused look on his face.

01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:15.600
He's about to, like he's got one of those looks

01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:16.780
like he's mid-eating.

01:43:16.780 --> 01:43:18.740
He's about to shove some cake in his mouth.

01:43:18.740 --> 01:43:20.420
And then he's like, huh?

01:43:20.420 --> 01:43:21.980
What is this chick saying?

01:43:21.980 --> 01:43:23.100
I'm like, it's pants, Mel.

01:43:23.100 --> 01:43:24.220
It's pants.

01:43:24.220 --> 01:43:25.420
Thank you for sharing.

01:43:25.420 --> 01:43:25.900
All right.

01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:27.660
I think I'm done with pants for the night, so.

01:43:27.660 --> 01:43:28.460
All right.

01:43:28.460 --> 01:43:29.380
Good evening to you all.

01:43:29.380 --> 01:43:29.900
Thanks.

01:43:29.900 --> 01:43:31.340
Thanks for calling in, hon.

01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:33.860
Have a good one.

01:43:33.860 --> 01:43:36.020
Our listeners are so funny.

01:43:36.020 --> 01:43:38.500
Maybe we can let one more call sneak in here.

01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:39.900
I'm liking the Skype line tonight.

01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:42.380
Everybody's getting in.

01:43:42.380 --> 01:43:44.020
So we'll see if anybody else gets in.

01:43:44.020 --> 01:43:45.700
Again, one more time.

01:43:45.700 --> 01:43:47.820
Please take a second.

01:43:47.820 --> 01:43:49.820
Vote for our podcast.

01:43:49.820 --> 01:43:51.460
We would totally appreciate that.

01:43:51.460 --> 01:43:53.980
It's podcastally.com.

01:43:53.980 --> 01:43:55.540
And then just do a search for Orange Lounge.

01:43:55.540 --> 01:43:58.900
Or better yet, I'll just post the link right there in the chatroom and you guys can vote.

01:43:58.900 --> 01:43:59.700
How's that sound?

01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:01.460
Alright, let's go ahead and take this call.

01:44:01.460 --> 01:44:03.580
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:44:03.580 --> 01:44:08.780
Hey, what do you call a binary system that distributes energy from one star into the other?

01:44:08.780 --> 01:44:09.780
What?

01:44:09.780 --> 01:44:12.180
It's John Fields.

01:44:12.180 --> 01:44:14.020
What's on your mind?

01:44:14.020 --> 01:44:21.020
Well, I was thinking about the upcoming E3, and you know, it's been quite a while since we've been hit with an arcade release of DDR.

01:44:21.020 --> 01:44:24.260
So I'm wondering if they might actually spring that on us.

01:44:24.260 --> 01:44:31.620
So, John thinks that a possible arcade release could be something that would be shown at E3.

01:44:31.620 --> 01:44:38.460
I would have to say, unfortunately, it's very doubtful, because E3 is typically a consumer electronic show.

01:44:38.460 --> 01:44:44.100
A new arcade mix would be something more for something like, what's the big arcade show they do in Vegas every year?

01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:45.820
Coin-Op, something?

01:44:45.820 --> 01:44:52.540
CES, Consumer Electronic Show? But they show arcade games there, that makes no sense.

01:44:52.540 --> 01:45:01.540
Alright, well, okay, but, um, I did once, though, it's not unheard of, because I did see last year Andamiro was showing off, of all people.

01:45:01.540 --> 01:45:03.540
It wasn't a Pump It Up game, but they were showing off an arcade game.

01:45:03.540 --> 01:45:04.540
That game was cool!

01:45:04.540 --> 01:45:06.540
That Korean, uh, tank? Was it a tank game?

01:45:06.540 --> 01:45:07.540
It was a shooting game!

01:45:07.540 --> 01:45:08.540
Yeah, it was like a shooting game?

01:45:08.540 --> 01:45:12.540
And you had your controls on your gun, and then you had your fire buttons on your gun.

01:45:12.540 --> 01:45:19.540
So, I'm not gonna say, can't happen, but, very, very unlikely, but, boy, wouldn't that be nice. Wouldn't that be nice.

01:45:19.540 --> 01:45:20.540
Yeah, it would.

01:45:20.540 --> 01:45:30.540
I guess also, since I am going to plug this anytime I can, I'll give you a little more information on Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst.

01:45:30.540 --> 01:45:31.540
Okay, sure, why not.

01:45:31.540 --> 01:45:35.540
This game has been confirmed for the USA and Europe now.

01:45:35.540 --> 01:45:41.540
I heard about the new, there was like a Phantasy Star universe that was coming, but that's a different thing, right?

01:45:41.540 --> 01:45:48.540
Yeah, that is actually the next incarnation of the game. Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst is basically the next Phantasy Star Online.

01:45:48.540 --> 01:45:53.280
online it's gonna have episode 4 and all that sort of stuff on it plus a bunch of

01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:58.740
new chat options and it's slated for a June 2005 release very cool I'm looking

01:45:58.740 --> 01:46:02.340

But I can hear myself.

01:47:55.700 --> 01:47:56.700
That's the problem.

01:47:56.700 --> 01:48:01.380
Oh no you shouldn't be able to hear yourself.

01:48:01.380 --> 01:48:02.380

01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:30.960
I could be standing right next to you in the chat room looking at you going, hmm, that's

01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:32.360
a pretty little thing.

01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:33.360
I'm speechless.

01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:34.360
I'm speechless.

01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:35.360
Well, that's a first.

01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:38.520
I... I... I'm speechless.

01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:42.440
Well, that's a first.

01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:47.760
Hey, old Rob is speechless, everybody!

01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:56.080
Yes, Jamie's here. Jamie, Sam wants to talk to you.

01:49:56.080 --> 01:50:01.880
I have... I have... I have Crayola sketches of your boobies.

01:50:01.880 --> 01:50:08.880
I like using the peach because it's realistic.

01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:18.880
Uh oh, I got company.

01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:20.880
I got somebody here with me.

01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:21.880
I'm Miss Cleo.

01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:23.880
Oh, hello.

01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:25.880
Hello, how are you today?

01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:27.880
Oh, I'm good, how are you?

01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:31.880
I'm hearing things, are you?

01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:35.880
Uh, how's Miss Cleo doing?

01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:39.880
Pardon me?

01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:43.880
Does Miss Cleo play DDR?

01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:47.880
I'm hearing an echo, echo, echo, echo, echo.

01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:51.880
Give me a minute,

01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:55.880
let me try something here. I think having two phones connected together

01:50:55.880 --> 01:50:57.880
Yeah, there's kinda screwin' it all up!

01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:05.880
Geez, Ron, don't cry till you pee your pants!

01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:09.880
I'll leave that to you, Stans.

01:51:09.880 --> 01:51:11.880
You sound like you're getting a little old there.

01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:13.880
You might be good at that point.

01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:17.880
Geez, you sound like a freakin' harpy!

01:51:17.880 --> 01:51:19.880
What the hell is going on?

01:51:19.880 --> 01:51:21.880
I don't know, Stan! It's your fault!

01:51:21.880 --> 01:51:37.880
Oh. Pardon me? My God, things have all gone cooky, cooky, dookie. All right, oh, there we go. Oh, no, that didn't work.

01:51:37.880 --> 01:51:46.960
Our, uh, uh, uh, Stan, before this echo kills us all, uh, uh, uh, any, uh, any final words

01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:48.960
you want to say on this call?

01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:55.000
Well, well, well, God, I can't even do that for real, that's just freaky!

01:51:55.000 --> 01:52:02.160
All I gotta say is to all you youngins playing DDR, hello, there we are, just remember one

01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:11.120
thing. You don't know who's watching behind you. Thank you, Stan. Peace out,

01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:27.960
suggest taking one more call? I'm sorry. Yeah, that was you that said take one more call. I was

01:52:27.960 --> 01:52:29.960
I'm just ready to move on to the next segment.

01:52:29.960 --> 01:52:31.960
What, what, what, what, what?

01:52:31.960 --> 01:52:33.960
What, what, what?

01:52:33.960 --> 01:52:37.960
Crayola sketches of your boobies.

01:52:37.960 --> 01:52:39.960
Dark Sakura.

01:52:39.960 --> 01:52:41.960
You know what?

01:52:41.960 --> 01:52:43.960
And right there.

01:52:43.960 --> 01:52:47.960
Hey, fellow broadcasters and VIPs listening tonight.

01:52:47.960 --> 01:52:51.960
There's your consideration clip for most unlikely to hear on AMFM radio.

01:52:51.960 --> 01:52:53.960
Thank you.

01:52:53.960 --> 01:53:04.640
this has been an orange lounge presentation oh hell all right we're

01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:07.680
gonna close the skype line for now but we will come back later I was gonna go

01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:10.440
to another break but we're actually kind of starting to run behind and show so I

01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:14.000
think we ought to just go into the next segment which is kind of weird but we're

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.720
gonna go into the orange launch cage match because we need a break because my

01:53:16.720 --> 01:53:21.000
face hurts from laughing seriously and some of our folks in our chat room are

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:25.880
saying that too that they haven't left pants for your face you can be a butthead

01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:36.920
listen you all right um I'm sorry to those you guys didn't get through we

01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:39.760
will open up the skype line at the end of the show if we have more time which

01:53:39.760 --> 01:53:43.080
I'm thinking we will if we can go ahead and move on to neuro next segment which

01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:50.080
is the cage match. Alright, in tonight's cage match, we have a very interesting scenario

01:53:51.820 --> 01:53:58.820
in tonight's cage match because we have a song going for a five week victory tonight.

01:53:59.500 --> 01:54:05.520
It typically we retire a song after four weeks. However, this song has not been voted into

01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:10.320
a fourth week because we did not have a show last night. So we kind of decided that...

01:54:10.320 --> 01:54:12.320
Of course we didn't have one last night.

01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:14.320
Or last week, last week, sorry.

01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:16.320
Last night was under Sedation Live.

01:54:16.320 --> 01:54:18.320
I tried coming in last week.

01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:20.320
Yeah, I heard about you coming last week.

01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:25.320
Alright, so we have a song going for a five-week victory.

01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:30.320
So if this song wins tonight, not only does it claim the first five-week victory,

01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:34.320
but will be the third song in Orange Lounge history to be retired.

01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:37.320
Alright, so again, a reminder, the way the cage match works,

01:54:37.320 --> 01:54:41.260
works we play three songs for you guys last week's winner and two new songs we

01:54:41.260 --> 01:54:44.580
play a clip of last week's winner two new songs in their entirety you guys

01:54:44.580 --> 01:54:48.140
vote for your favorites and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on

01:54:48.140 --> 01:54:52.020
orange lounge radio doesn't have to be a balani song doesn't have to have

01:54:52.020 --> 01:54:56.140
anything to do with the money they're just songs that we think are cool but

01:54:56.140 --> 01:54:59.980
you know what this cage match we do have a way of setting trends because may I

01:54:59.980 --> 01:55:04.620
remind you what songs have we played in the cage match previously that went on

01:55:04.620 --> 01:55:12.620
to win uh lava wherever you are uh delirium after all jason evans i'm in heaven with you

01:55:12.620 --> 01:55:18.380
where did all these songs end up ddr so you never know what might become of the orange

01:55:18.380 --> 01:55:23.900
lounge radio cage match so here it is going for its very maybe last win and retirement

01:55:23.900 --> 01:55:30.900
yoko kano song number one with rise enjoy

01:56:23.900 --> 01:56:33.900
Oh, the sky is shining, the sky is shining

01:56:33.900 --> 01:56:36.900
And there you are dear, for the day

01:56:36.900 --> 01:56:39.900
When no pain is far behind

01:56:39.900 --> 01:56:43.900
On your feet, come with me

01:56:43.900 --> 01:56:46.900
Be a song and no light

01:56:46.900 --> 01:56:49.900
There you are dear, take your place

01:56:49.900 --> 01:56:53.900
Please don't fall, I'm just missing

01:56:53.900 --> 01:56:57.900
Some say I'm weak, but only it's time to make

01:56:57.900 --> 01:57:01.900
Just a great fight

01:57:01.900 --> 01:57:07.900
Here I go, bye

01:57:15.900 --> 01:57:18.900
I'm a soldier from success

01:57:18.900 --> 01:57:21.900
In this waking hell I am

01:57:21.900 --> 01:57:27.900
Listening more than I can compute

01:57:28.900 --> 01:57:31.900
Pray myself please don't forget

01:57:31.900 --> 01:57:34.900
Life betrayed and be a threat

01:57:34.900 --> 01:57:40.900
Please give me the strength to be a true hero

01:57:40.900 --> 01:57:47.900
People placed in the fire together

01:57:47.900 --> 01:58:15.660
All right, that was a clip of song number one, Yokokano Rise, possibly the third song

01:58:45.660 --> 01:58:50.220
some of it is just way too cool I had to put one in the cage match so here it is

01:58:50.220 --> 01:58:54.700
song number two this is Beck with a song called ghetto chip malfunction and it's

01:58:54.700 --> 01:59:01.780
actually a song called hell yes remixed by 8-bit enjoy song number two

01:59:24.700 --> 01:59:28.060
equipment looking for shelter readjust your position

01:59:28.060 --> 01:59:31.820
thought control goes really confession two dimensions

01:59:31.820 --> 01:59:35.500
dumb your hands down duck don't look now company missiles

01:59:35.500 --> 01:59:39.500
power was watching when the cops are watching make your dreams not a paper

01:59:39.500 --> 01:59:42.500
cliche, wasted, hate, taste test

01:59:42.500 --> 01:59:46.500
hell yes, now I'm moving this way, I'm doing this thing

01:59:46.500 --> 01:59:51.500
hell yes, now I'm turning it on, now I'm hooking my legs

01:59:51.500 --> 01:59:56.500
hell yes, now I'm calling you out, I'm switching my place

01:59:56.500 --> 02:00:01.500
hell yes, now I'm cleaning the floor, my beat is correct

02:00:01.500 --> 02:00:04.500
hell yes, yeah that's it

02:00:04.500 --> 02:00:07.500
yeah that's it

02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:09.500
Yeah, that's it.

02:00:09.500 --> 02:00:17.540
Stretch to the limit, attention spans snap back, retract, collapse into live tracks,

02:00:17.540 --> 02:00:22.700
noise response, applause and hand claps, floodgates open to the sound of the river,

02:00:22.700 --> 02:00:27.540
breaking points on the verge of pointless, fools annoyed until the followers stand fair,

02:00:27.540 --> 02:00:32.420
look for the common, not superficial, cold bread, cold or welcome home of the crisis,

02:00:32.420 --> 02:00:37.700
for fuckery idols, rewriting the bibles, the magic market running out of the ink, lives

02:00:37.700 --> 02:00:41.700
Turn the lights out, back to the scene answer, get your damn hands up

02:00:41.700 --> 02:00:45.700
Hell yes, now I'm moving this way, I'm doing this thing

02:00:45.700 --> 02:00:50.700
Hell yes, now I'm turning it on, now I'm working my legs

02:00:50.700 --> 02:00:55.700
Hell yes, now I'm calling you out, I'm searching my place

02:00:55.700 --> 02:01:00.700
Hell yes, now I'm cleaning the floor, my beat is correct

02:01:00.700 --> 02:01:01.700
Yes Yes

02:01:01.700 --> 02:01:02.700
Yes Hi

02:01:02.700 --> 02:01:03.700
Hi I like your face

02:01:03.700 --> 02:01:06.700
Your beat is nice Your beat is nice

02:01:06.700 --> 02:01:09.700
Yeah that's it Yeah that's it

02:01:09.700 --> 02:01:10.700
Yes Yeah

02:01:10.700 --> 02:01:11.700
Yes Not gonna swim

02:01:11.700 --> 02:01:15.700
I'm through with the spin Can you enjoy?

02:01:15.700 --> 02:01:18.700
Hell yes Not too very dumb

02:01:18.700 --> 02:01:24.700
I'm broken my legs It's a lie

02:01:24.700 --> 02:01:42.700
Hell yes Now I'm taking it on, I'm working my legs

02:01:42.700 --> 02:01:49.700
Hell yes Now I'm calling you out, I'm switching my place

02:01:49.700 --> 02:01:50.700
Hell yes Now I'm creating a floor, my feet is cracked

02:01:50.700 --> 02:01:55.100
the next song there. That was song number two, Ghetto Chip Malfunction by Beck. Let's

02:01:55.100 --> 02:01:57.420
see what everybody thought of that. Dark Sakura.

02:01:57.420 --> 02:02:03.900
That was pretty cool. It would give me a headache if I listened to it on repeat, which I would

02:02:03.900 --> 02:02:08.280
probably do. So I would give it a nine. A very solid nine.

02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:12.180
The EP actually has four songs on it all in that same style, so it's kind of cool.

02:02:12.180 --> 02:02:15.740
Well, as long as I've been listening to very diverse things lately, that's right up my

02:02:15.740 --> 02:02:16.740
alley, so yeah.

02:02:16.740 --> 02:02:21.380
Very cool. Alright, let's see who's next. Who else has got a mic? Who's got a mic over there? Jonas!

02:02:21.380 --> 02:02:28.980
Let's see. Orgasmic Nostalgia. It's pretty good. I like it. A nine. A nine! Alright.

02:02:28.980 --> 02:02:35.540
Sharks Girl. That was pretty nifty, and I don't normally like that. So, I think the remix part

02:02:35.540 --> 02:02:39.700
of it made it really kind of cool, and I liked the hell yes at the end. I was like, oh nifty!

02:02:39.700 --> 02:02:52.900
so uh 9.3759 okay uh islander i i think i'd give it i wouldn't quite give it a nine though

02:02:52.900 --> 02:03:01.140
i'd give it an eight all right an eight mel i like the production a lot i'm a sucker for a nice uh

02:03:01.140 --> 02:03:06.340
kick drum you know kick drum machine type sound with uh some nice the hard synths in it i'd give

02:03:06.340 --> 02:03:16.860
give it a nice 9.4. All right. Loki. It's an 8. Angel. It's Beck, it's a 9. I actually

02:03:16.860 --> 02:03:21.140
don't typically care for Beck a whole lot. I mean, he's okay, but again, the 8-bit thing

02:03:21.140 --> 02:03:28.220
does it for me. I love it. Please enjoy. 9. All right. Let's see if song number 3 is going

02:03:28.220 --> 02:03:34.820
to win tonight, and song number 3 is Loki's pick. Loki, what did you pick for us tonight?

02:03:34.820 --> 02:03:37.380
My computer's down right now, it's in pieces.

02:03:37.380 --> 02:03:40.060
Please don't let it be Papa Smurf lick my ass.

02:03:40.060 --> 02:03:44.580
I already submitted that one, so that doesn't work.

02:03:44.580 --> 02:03:45.800
No, um...

02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:50.660
This song, I had Jimmy find me a song real quick.

02:03:50.660 --> 02:03:52.780
And...

02:03:52.780 --> 02:03:54.100
That's right, folks.

02:03:54.100 --> 02:03:55.340
It's GIRLS!

02:03:55.340 --> 02:03:56.180
Enjoy!

02:04:25.340 --> 02:04:35.340
Right now, right now, right now

02:04:35.340 --> 02:05:03.340
Right now, right now, right now, right now.

02:07:33.340 --> 02:07:48.340
Okay, so how appropriate that the last show at this studio will have prodigy with girls, the still shot mix this time in the cage match. What do we think of the still shot mix? Dark Sakura.

02:07:48.340 --> 02:07:58.340
It's a mix of that song that doesn't completely suck donkey ass, which is double ass if you think about it. So it gets an 8.

02:07:58.340 --> 02:08:02.620
Get it donkey ass ass ass and then eight from dark soccer Jonas

02:08:04.900 --> 02:08:08.340
Sorry, it's trying to go in the same order I agree the remix is very great

02:08:08.340 --> 02:08:14.580
So I like the big beat into it. So I'll give it a nine. All right sharks girl

02:08:15.380 --> 02:08:19.780
I'm feeling generous in that freaking own pen. Whoo Islander

02:08:20.860 --> 02:08:22.860
Don't have a mouthful of cake. I'll say nine

02:08:22.860 --> 02:08:29.860
I was feeling that beat man, it's like a throwback to the early 80's Africa Bambata type hip-hop,

02:08:31.780 --> 02:08:36.460
old school break beat type stuff. If I had more room here I'd do a head spin so I'd give

02:08:36.460 --> 02:08:43.460
it a 9, 10. Alright, Loki! It gets a 9 and that belt gets a 10. Alright, and you know

02:08:43.460 --> 02:08:54.460
I hate to be the party pooper, but I was only feeling that song for about the first minute.

02:08:54.460 --> 02:08:58.460
And once the vocals came in, it kind of lost me, so I can only really give it like a 6.5.

02:08:58.460 --> 02:08:59.460
Angel?

02:08:59.460 --> 02:09:02.460
For the beat, I'd give it a 7.

02:09:02.460 --> 02:09:03.460
Alright.

02:09:03.460 --> 02:09:08.460
Very tough decision tonight, you guys, but here it is, the three songs you get to vote for.

02:09:08.460 --> 02:09:11.660
Song number one, Yokokano with Rise.

02:09:11.660 --> 02:09:18.660
That's a bad clip. Let me try another clip.

02:09:23.180 --> 02:09:26.980
Alright, song number two you can vote for tonight is Beck with Ghetto Chip

02:09:26.980 --> 02:09:33.980
Malfunction.

02:09:35.300 --> 02:09:38.140
And song number three you can vote for tonight is

02:09:38.140 --> 02:09:45.140
prodigy with girls the still shop mix

My butt! I mean, Prodigy.

02:10:17.780 --> 02:10:29.780
Alright. Now, Loki, I know you've had kind of a dramatic week and a lot of stuff going on, but you know I have to ask, this is the point of the show where I always want to know, what's going on in the Sim scene?

02:10:29.780 --> 02:10:47.780
Well, there's a few things actually. There was XXMix came out. It's another Japanese like fan mix type thing. It's kind of cool. They've got some pretty interesting songs in there. They have a really good remix of 501, a really shitty remix of Celebrate Night, so it kind of evens out.

02:10:47.780 --> 02:10:57.780
You can find the link for that on BamaiStyle under the wonderful Japanese fan mix, like food mix thread, and that's in there.

02:10:57.780 --> 02:11:04.780
And then also, there was, oh man, what the? SiberiaStyle 2.5 came out, that's also StepMania skin.

02:11:04.780 --> 02:11:13.780
Sort of resembles Technofeen, it's pretty good. I haven't really noticed any differences between the 2.5 and 2, but yeah, download it anyways, it's pretty good.

02:11:13.780 --> 02:11:20.780
That's pretty much it for now. Oh, and DDR UK's back up. But, eh, whatever.

02:11:21.780 --> 02:11:29.780
Alright. Wow, this is tough because I'm trying to tally votes from tonight's cage match here, so somebody's got to help me fill time.

02:11:29.780 --> 02:11:31.780
Dark Sakura, tell them about some of the other people...

02:11:31.780 --> 02:11:33.780
I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts.

02:11:33.780 --> 02:11:35.780
Tell them about some of the lovely...

02:11:37.780 --> 02:11:39.780
What am I supposed to tell people about?

02:11:39.780 --> 02:11:41.780
Some of the other lovely programming we have on Orange Laundry.

02:11:41.780 --> 02:11:45.780
Yeah, we do other shows. Do we still do Diversion on Monday?

02:11:45.780 --> 02:11:46.780
Yes, we are.

02:11:46.780 --> 02:11:50.780
Okay, there's Diversion on Monday and it starts whenever the hell it feels like playing it.

02:11:50.780 --> 02:11:56.780
And then on Tuesday, I do pump up the volume, which is actually Gorillaz Marathon. I'm sorry.

02:11:56.780 --> 02:12:02.780
Which is actually whatever I feel like playing at the time, or whatever the chat room requests.

02:12:02.780 --> 02:12:08.780
It's really supposed to be your request show, but no one ever requests anything except for really bizarre shit I don't have.

02:12:08.780 --> 02:12:11.740
Although I do have a bunch of bizarre stuff.

02:12:11.740 --> 02:12:15.180
Pre-show starts at a quarter to seven, the show starts at seven thirty to ten thirty,

02:12:15.180 --> 02:12:19.380
or whenever the hell I feel like passing out.

02:12:19.380 --> 02:12:22.780
This Tuesday, by the way, I will not be doing the show on Tuesday.

02:12:22.780 --> 02:12:25.900
I will be doing it another night.

02:12:25.900 --> 02:12:30.780
Because my ass take a night off on my birthday, so fuck that.

02:12:30.780 --> 02:12:35.460
So you can check our Orange Lounge LiveJournal community for the information on when the

02:12:35.460 --> 02:12:37.020
show will be rescheduled for.

02:12:37.020 --> 02:12:39.020
Yeah, responsible bullshit.

02:12:39.020 --> 02:12:43.020
Next up is Rob's show, Outside the Box.

02:12:43.020 --> 02:12:47.020
Yes, but Outside the Box is actually on hiatus until the station relaunch in May.

02:12:47.020 --> 02:12:49.020
So it comes on eventually.

02:12:49.020 --> 02:12:51.020
Yes, eventually. You have to look forward to that.

02:12:51.020 --> 02:12:56.020
Well, maybe we'll have to make some type of arrangement.

02:12:56.020 --> 02:12:59.020
I will be doing my show just on a different night.

02:13:02.020 --> 02:13:06.020
And then we do the repeat thingy.

02:13:06.020 --> 02:13:10.540
on DDR Freak actually. That's indeed right, I just want to make a mention.

02:13:10.540 --> 02:13:14.160
And we actually have a lot of people that listen over on DDR Freak, and so

02:13:14.160 --> 02:13:18.000
as kind of a thank you to you guys over on DDR Freak for making us kind of a

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:23.300
popular little spin-off over on DDR Freak Radio, we actually now are on same-week

02:13:23.300 --> 02:13:24.380
rotation.

02:13:24.380 --> 02:13:28.180
So because of the fact that we didn't have a show last week, we used it as a chance to

02:13:28.180 --> 02:13:31.840
clean the gap there on DDR Freak. So now you are hearing,

02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:35.460
when you hear this show, this is the show that we did that same Sunday. You don't

02:13:35.460 --> 02:13:38.220
to wait a week anymore you're actually getting the show the same week we did it

02:13:38.220 --> 02:13:47.100
and you'll be hearing it in like full mp3 pro quality yes yes so because they

02:13:47.100 --> 02:13:49.820
have they have very good quality over there at DDR freak radio so you get a

02:13:49.820 --> 02:13:55.260
good quality yeah I'd say it's a pretty nice operation run over there yeah and

02:13:55.260 --> 02:14:02.180
then we have our new spin-off ferret radio actually um we are as when we

02:14:02.180 --> 02:14:05.740
relaunch in May and kind of things you know take over again we're going to be

02:14:05.740 --> 02:14:11.420
kind of looking for new talent to do some new shows so you know maybe we need

02:14:11.420 --> 02:14:16.620
to be doing orange lounge idol oh yeah so we'll see what happens we have so if

02:14:16.620 --> 02:14:22.260
you want to be a part of the best of 2005 nominated Orange Lounge radio we're

02:14:22.260 --> 02:14:25.500
gonna have opportunities coming up and it doesn't have to be about Bahmani

02:14:25.500 --> 02:14:30.800
anything gaming related in the slightest we're gonna take so we'll have more

02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:36.860
details on that coming soon so and don't forget about the the kick the ultra Kade

02:14:36.860 --> 02:14:41.900
but oh yes we have that too yes we need more pictures of people kicking ultra

02:14:41.900 --> 02:14:47.540
Kade machines those bits are trying to steal the main name yeah I think some of

02:14:47.540 --> 02:14:50.840
that got settled and that's not happening but it's still funny so the

02:14:50.840 --> 02:14:55.180
fact that the dude tried and he was such a complete retard because the name was

02:14:55.180 --> 02:15:00.300
already registered and already somebody else's invention so yeah kick you know

02:15:00.300 --> 02:15:05.300
So, kick an Ultra Cave machine out of love for Orange Lounge and send me the picture.

02:15:05.300 --> 02:15:06.300
Alright.

02:15:06.300 --> 02:15:07.300
Sounds good.

02:15:07.300 --> 02:15:12.180
And only one person has voted for us on Podcast Alley tonight, so I hope that maybe some of

02:15:12.180 --> 02:15:15.100
the rest of you guys are just waiting on those email confirmations.

02:15:15.100 --> 02:15:16.260
They won't spam you.

02:15:16.260 --> 02:15:20.300
There is completely nothing to vote for us over on Podcast Alley.

02:15:20.300 --> 02:15:21.300
Please do.

02:15:21.300 --> 02:15:22.300
We'd appreciate it.

02:15:22.300 --> 02:15:23.820
Alright, let's hear it.

02:15:23.820 --> 02:15:25.620
You guys want to hear tonight's winner of the Cage Match?

02:15:25.620 --> 02:15:26.620
Ah, sure.

02:15:26.620 --> 02:15:27.620
Alright.

02:15:27.620 --> 02:15:29.100
Now, here's the interesting thing.

02:15:29.100 --> 02:15:34.280
votes tonight than any other cage match in orange launch radio history so this

02:15:34.280 --> 02:15:37.740
was now and I and somebody in the chat room actually called me on it said sky

02:15:37.740 --> 02:15:41.860
you say it every week that the cage match is a hard one to decide tonight

02:15:41.860 --> 02:15:46.220
definitely is the case because of so many votes more votes tonight than any

02:15:46.220 --> 02:15:50.140
other night what is the winner

02:15:52.060 --> 02:15:58.960
yoko kano goes into retirement with a fifth week and now that I think about it

02:15:58.960 --> 02:16:02.880
we have no show next week six weeks that song will have been a cage match victor

02:16:02.880 --> 02:16:08.160
six weeks you guys have called that song a lot of people in history a lot of

02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:11.640
people in their comments actually said it deserves retirement I'm only voting

02:16:11.640 --> 02:16:16.240
for it because it deserves to be retired so there you go

02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:26.960
I think it's a but this is nice because now Loki has had one song retired

02:16:26.960 --> 02:16:30.500
realize that I'm going to have to have like one of those head braces because my

02:16:30.500 --> 02:16:34.520
egos gonna fall out of proportion this is I'm going to look like the head this

02:16:34.520 --> 02:16:38.380
is a nice note to end on because with the whole we are starting over joke we

02:16:38.380 --> 02:16:41.480
have going tonight because Loki has now had one song retired echo image come

02:16:41.480 --> 02:16:45.760
back I have had one song retired Gwen Stefani what you waiting for and yeah

02:16:45.760 --> 02:16:50.040
dark dark Sakura has now had one song retired with yoko Kano with rise so

02:16:50.040 --> 02:16:56.600
we've all had one song retired and so when we come back in on May 1st cage

02:16:56.600 --> 02:17:01.600
Kage Match starts over. Kage Match starts new. Three brand new songs are going to be in it, so it'll be interesting.

02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:06.600
We're going to have to change up the theme. We'll have to do something. We'll have to work on that over the next couple weeks. Change up the theme.

02:17:06.600 --> 02:17:14.600
Oh, and by the way, since I made a mention of this to Rob and Loki earlier, I do want to actually give a shout out to some of our listeners.

02:17:14.600 --> 02:17:18.600
This is some of our UK listeners. Hi.

02:17:18.600 --> 02:17:24.320
Yes, actually, I... the cool... is such a cool thing about doing this radio show, and

02:17:24.320 --> 02:17:27.400
I know a lot of times we talk about, like, Sacramento things, and things we're doing

02:17:27.400 --> 02:17:30.880
in Sacramento, gaming and some of that, and Bay Area, because we're just across the street

02:17:30.880 --> 02:17:35.960
from the Bay Area, pretty much. We've got listeners in Canada, as you found out tonight,

02:17:35.960 --> 02:17:38.880
we have that caller from Ghetto. We've got listeners in the UK, we've gotten some email

02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:43.960
from the UK. We've gotten some listeners in Japan, too. Japan is actually one of our biggest

02:17:43.960 --> 02:17:46.980
country representations. I believe our number... our third most listed country. I think number

02:17:46.980 --> 02:17:52.300
three behind U.S. and Canada, actually. I think U.K. or England itself is actually number

02:17:52.300 --> 02:17:53.300
four.

02:17:53.300 --> 02:17:54.300
Yep.

02:17:54.300 --> 02:18:00.060
So, you know, and I wanted to stop and make that mention to our listeners in, you know,

02:18:00.060 --> 02:18:04.620
in non-United States countries, because, you know, even though we go off on everything

02:18:04.620 --> 02:18:07.680
happening over here, we're still thinking of you guys, so thank you for listening to

02:18:07.680 --> 02:18:12.260
us and for blowing up my ego to astronomical proportions.

02:18:12.260 --> 02:18:18.260
Alright, now, we have a choice for what we can do next week for the cage match. We're

02:18:18.260 --> 02:18:24.100
gonna have a pre-taped show, so there's two things we can do. A, we have, it's gonna be

02:18:24.100 --> 02:18:29.740
a pre-taped cage match next week, um, and we will actually do the voting on our website.

02:18:29.740 --> 02:18:34.100
So there's two choices we can do for that. We can do A, the ultimate cage match with

02:18:34.100 --> 02:18:38.420
all the retired songs, and choose a victor between all three of those retired songs.

02:18:38.420 --> 02:18:42.420
Of course then it wouldn't be a surprise what you're going to hear or choice number two

02:18:42.420 --> 02:18:47.820
and the chat room has been begging us to do this for about 70 weeks now, reverse cage

02:18:47.820 --> 02:18:50.060
match number two.

02:18:50.060 --> 02:18:52.980
What do you think?

02:18:52.980 --> 02:18:53.980
Reverse cage match.

02:18:53.980 --> 02:18:58.980
It would be good to end season four with the retirees.

02:18:58.980 --> 02:19:00.900
We have three retirees now, right?

02:19:00.900 --> 02:19:01.900
Yup.

02:19:01.900 --> 02:19:03.900
Why not do both?

02:19:03.900 --> 02:19:07.900
Alright, we're going to do both next week.

02:19:07.900 --> 02:19:08.900
So there'll be two cage matches.

02:19:08.900 --> 02:19:09.900
Because we love you guys!

02:19:09.900 --> 02:19:12.980
Double ultimate secret cage match!

02:19:12.980 --> 02:19:18.820
We'll do the retirees to end season four, and we'll do the reverse cage match to start

02:19:18.820 --> 02:19:19.820
season five.

02:19:19.820 --> 02:19:22.420
Actually, this is season five that's ending right now, season five.

02:19:22.420 --> 02:19:23.860
Well, it's season six!

02:19:23.860 --> 02:19:24.860
Sorry.

02:19:24.860 --> 02:19:26.860
So season five will come to an end with two season matches.

02:19:26.860 --> 02:19:27.860
The season of Satan!

02:19:27.860 --> 02:19:29.460
This is like a reality show finale.

02:19:29.460 --> 02:19:33.940
Now for those with confused looks on their faces, what's a reverse cage match?

02:19:33.940 --> 02:19:39.420
That is where we pick three songs and the winning song is banned from Orange Lounge

02:19:39.420 --> 02:19:41.980
Radio and will never be played again.

02:19:41.980 --> 02:19:51.020
In the last reverse cage match, which took place on episode 69, it was complicated from

02:19:51.020 --> 02:19:55.820
Dance Mania Speed 9, was banned from the station forever.

02:19:55.820 --> 02:19:59.660
So the speed mix of complicated was banned from the station forever.

02:19:59.660 --> 02:20:00.660
We will not play it.

02:20:00.660 --> 02:20:08.300
Both coming back next week. It's gonna be a two-cage match week. All right, so look

02:20:08.300 --> 02:20:15.860
for that. All right, um, I think we need to go to a break. I need to break

02:20:15.860 --> 02:20:18.780
something. Yeah, we need a break. When we come back, we're gonna have the FUs of

02:20:18.780 --> 02:20:23.740
the week and maybe a couple more Skype calls. Ask Orange Lounge, we have to do

02:20:23.740 --> 02:20:28.760
one more of those in the studio, and whatever else we think of. So we'll be

02:20:28.760 --> 02:20:38.360
back after this in this break what's a fun theme to do for this break let's see

02:20:38.360 --> 02:20:42.000
I'm digging through the old songs just play maximizer three times in a row no

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:49.320
we're not going to do max but we can do songs that start with M let's do that

02:20:49.320 --> 02:20:54.000
we're gonna do songs that start with M so we'll be back after this break started

02:20:54.000 --> 02:21:01.000
with some Matsuri Japan. We'll be back after this.

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:55.000
Go!

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:56.000
Go!

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:57.000
Go!

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:58.000
Go!

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:51.000
The last that ever she saw it Carried away by a moonlight

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:55.000
She had a bad song, worried and warning

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:58.000
Carried away by a moonlight

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
She had a chance to look in the riddle

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
There's a Saturday night

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:05.000
Far away on the other side

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:08.000
She was caught in the middle of a different spot

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:12.000
And she couldn't find how to push through

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:16.000
She sang for an evening

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
Carried away by a moonlight

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
She had a sad song

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:24.000
Cold and breathing, carried away

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:29.000
By the moonlight shadow, she saw what's been when it's gone

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:32.000
Far away on the other side

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:36.000
He was shot six times by the man on the run

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:40.000
And she couldn't find how he pushed through

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:43.000
I said, I said, I prayed

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:46.000
Are you in heaven one day?

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:50.000
Day falling and it's morning

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:53.000
Coming your way, by a moonlight shed

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:57.000
I want your vision burning

02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:00.000
Coming your way, by a moonlight shed

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:03.000
Shed, shed, shed, shed, shed, shed, shed, shed

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:09.000

Currently, a radio dedicated to all things Bomani and then some, but in two weeks, what gamers really want to know.

02:27:29.500 --> 02:27:33.500
The live show here, what we've got going on in this three hour program, it's not going to really change.

02:27:33.500 --> 02:27:38.500
We still are going to be the source, the premier internet radio source for DDR and other music and rhythm game news.

02:27:38.500 --> 02:27:40.500
We're not going to change what we're doing Sunday nights.

02:27:40.500 --> 02:27:45.180
it's just the change is going to affect the podcast which you know this kind of

02:27:45.180 --> 02:27:48.300
already happened if you listen to this week's episode and it also is going to

02:27:48.300 --> 02:27:50.780
affect the rest of what you're on the station we're gonna be looking for new

02:27:50.780 --> 02:27:56.180
shows to kind of expand we want to be the video gaming internet radio station

02:27:56.180 --> 02:28:00.420
the station so we're kind of excited about it so we're looking forward to it

02:28:00.420 --> 02:28:06.620
we are gonna have the biggest adjective ever and we know that the only way we're

02:28:06.620 --> 02:28:10.520
gonna achieve this is with your guys's help and because we have an awesome

02:28:10.520 --> 02:28:13.940
listening base there is no way in hell we would ever have been nominated to the

02:28:13.940 --> 02:28:17.140
best of life 365 Awards without our listening base and all these other

02:28:17.140 --> 02:28:24.180
things we do you guys rock love you guys kisses alright so that being said let's

02:28:24.180 --> 02:28:30.060
go from the lovey-dovey chat to the angst and hatred chat that you guys have

02:28:30.060 --> 02:28:34.700
come to know and love and hopefully this won't be directed at the listeners

02:28:34.700 --> 02:28:39.200
tonight I think we might want to leave on a good note here so dark Sakura why

02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:44.940
is it that we always do these f-use of the week every single week

02:28:44.940 --> 02:29:08.540
Okay, big F you to people who drive ten miles under the speed limit when I'm driving twenty

02:29:08.540 --> 02:29:09.540
over.

02:29:09.540 --> 02:29:16.700
An F.U. to my driver's side window that keeps rolling down, and a sap that fell all over

02:29:16.700 --> 02:29:25.460
my car windows in a sticky manner that has faded put little droplets all over my window.

02:29:25.460 --> 02:29:32.420
F.U. to being bored by just about everything since the semester is almost over, school

02:29:32.420 --> 02:29:36.340
has gotten into the really boring yet really hectic phase where, oh my god I gotta get

02:29:36.340 --> 02:29:42.800
all the shit done you know if you do my allergies in the springtime in general

02:29:42.800 --> 02:29:52.060
and if you to living in my crappy apartment with my interesting neighbors

02:29:52.060 --> 02:30:01.360
and I mean interest by interesting I mean totally sucky no my neighbors think

02:30:01.360 --> 02:30:11.360
are all thug gangsters. Yeah. Um, and as, I mean, the really wannabe thinking they are.

02:30:11.360 --> 02:30:16.360
It's a really annoying kind. If they really were, I'd think, oh well that's kind of awesome,

02:30:16.360 --> 02:30:27.360
but no. So. Um, yeah, and uh, I want to go back to Alabama. Cause I need grit. I'm done.

02:30:27.360 --> 02:30:32.360
Alright, Loki!

02:30:32.360 --> 02:30:37.360
Fuck you to moving! I hate moving! Moving sucks!

02:30:37.360 --> 02:30:42.360
Honestly, I mean, let's see, let's start off with people that drive slow.

02:30:42.360 --> 02:30:47.360
Every single person, old person, person in a truck, always driving goddamn slow.

02:30:47.360 --> 02:30:52.360
And I'm doing, honestly, I'm doing like the speed limit because I don't want to go crazy with my car and stuff,

02:30:52.360 --> 02:30:57.440
a ton of, you know, boxes in and stuff I can't see out the back window or anything like that.

02:30:57.440 --> 02:31:02.800
So, you know, I've been doing pretty good, you know, but these guys are going like twenty

02:31:02.800 --> 02:31:09.420
in a goddamn fifty, okay? Stuff like that. It's so awful. Um, then, also, to the fact

02:31:09.420 --> 02:31:13.960
that I have just so much crap to pack, that just really sucks. Pucking in my apartment

02:31:13.960 --> 02:31:20.380
for having a air conditioning unit right next to the bedroom, um, that sounds like a jet

02:31:20.380 --> 02:31:21.980
engine

02:31:21.980 --> 02:31:26.800
firing up uh... in the middle it went some bastard upstairs wanted air

02:31:26.800 --> 02:31:30.280
i mean it's not that hot outside and he's fucking

02:31:30.280 --> 02:31:32.660
terrier is off

02:31:32.660 --> 02:31:34.860
well i got

02:31:34.860 --> 02:31:37.700
dead-end no anyway

02:31:37.700 --> 02:31:41.620
i think we could have a good i can't believe through anything but you know

02:31:41.620 --> 02:31:45.540
my you know fiance cannot and

02:31:45.540 --> 02:31:48.280
no didn't like that too much

02:31:48.280 --> 02:31:49.700
also uh...

02:31:49.700 --> 02:31:52.360
the fact that uh...

02:31:52.360 --> 02:31:55.080
my car's check engine light came on

02:31:55.080 --> 02:31:56.180
why

02:31:56.180 --> 02:31:57.700
why now

02:31:57.700 --> 02:32:01.180
especially now that you know moving costs money

02:32:01.180 --> 02:32:04.920
fixing a car is not exactly the agenda

02:32:04.920 --> 02:32:06.460
things are pretty tight as it is

02:32:06.460 --> 02:32:11.080
hope nothing majorly wrong is with my car

02:32:11.080 --> 02:32:15.900
if it's something really bad i can take it to the dealership and they'll fix it

02:32:15.900 --> 02:32:21.300
you know because I've got that extended warranty that thank God I bought I don't

02:32:21.300 --> 02:32:25.100
know it just really sucks sucks that I'm also gonna be without internet for you

02:32:25.100 --> 02:32:29.520
know a couple days and cable TV and that kind of stuff but I'll live since I'm

02:32:29.520 --> 02:32:33.820
gonna be packing and moving shit for the next few days that sucks

02:32:33.820 --> 02:32:38.940
that's me to that goddamn TV for being so fucking heavy I mean this TV is like

02:32:38.940 --> 02:32:44.860
I think it's a 27 inch TV or something and it weighs a ton it's like we

02:32:44.860 --> 02:32:51.860
We comprise our TV of solid lead and spent uranium.

02:32:51.860 --> 02:32:56.860
It's like, I don't understand why that TV's gotta be so damn heavy, but it is.

02:32:56.860 --> 02:32:59.860
And then, um, let's see what else.

02:32:59.860 --> 02:33:11.860
Oh, fuck you, the, um, mutated, ugly, um, bitch next door that, um, rented me my U-Haul truck because, um, I rented it online, you know, I reserved a 14-foot truck.

02:33:11.860 --> 02:33:17.740
there I've been trying to call you and I couldn't get hold of you well I had you

02:33:17.740 --> 02:33:22.380
know I gave you know my work number and my home number I never heard a call over

02:33:22.380 --> 02:33:27.940
here now I've been sitting here packing she's like we don't have a 14 foot truck

02:33:27.940 --> 02:33:32.340

02:33:37.960 --> 02:33:43.960
gimp truck so then I take the gimp truck drive it around the fucking you know

02:33:43.960 --> 02:33:48.420
everything's breaking those things like oh my god let's get this packed and done

02:33:48.420 --> 02:33:52.320
with you know before the truck falls apart we can get it back to her and

02:33:52.320 --> 02:33:58.320
honestly we drove a total of seven miles seven miles the gas gauge is full it's

02:33:58.320 --> 02:34:04.000
still on full we get there you'll go it's that my pride in you fill it up I'm

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:07.840
I'm charging you $3 for gas!

02:34:07.840 --> 02:34:09.200
For seven miles!

02:34:09.200 --> 02:34:13.080
I mean, granted, I understand, you know, this might be like an SUV,

02:34:13.080 --> 02:34:17.840
but, you know, I don't think I use $7 for the gas driving seven miles.

02:34:17.840 --> 02:34:20.240
Or, you know, $3 for the gas, whatever it is.

02:34:20.240 --> 02:34:22.220
I mean, shit.

02:34:22.220 --> 02:34:28.000
Oh, and not to mention that the truck cost me $19.99 to start off with, $1.19 a mile,

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.720
$7 for the goddamn dolly,

02:34:30.720 --> 02:34:33.400
And then $5 for convenience fee for on-

02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:36.680
What the fuck, I got charged $5 for convenience fee online!

02:34:36.680 --> 02:34:40.400
Not to get the same truck I want, instead I get a gimp truck.

02:34:40.400 --> 02:34:41.520
What the fuck is that?

02:34:41.520 --> 02:34:43.920
Where's Jamie when you need her, because she would be yelling at you-

02:34:43.920 --> 02:34:46.160
She would be filing a complaint for you right now.

02:34:47.360 --> 02:34:48.760
Here she comes!

02:34:50.520 --> 02:34:52.520
Fuck you to the chair for eating the microphone.

02:34:53.400 --> 02:34:55.400
Okay, what did I miss? Because I was holding my laundry.

02:34:55.400 --> 02:34:58.200
Uh, run by the bill again and why you got charged.

02:34:58.200 --> 02:35:07.460
Anyways, so ugly, um, you know, inbred bitch next door, um, she, oh, might I add, she,

02:35:07.460 --> 02:35:11.120
for anyone that's out there that's seen Men in Black, okay, you know there's a point in

02:35:11.120 --> 02:35:17.440
the movie where this evil alien thing takes over a human host body and kind of does this

02:35:17.440 --> 02:35:21.600
weird face, you know, jarring thing with his face and was like, ahhh, you know, she kept

02:35:21.600 --> 02:35:26.080
making that, like, look, you know, all of a sudden, it's a three hour show, run down

02:35:26.080 --> 02:35:33.080
to rent the truck, which isn't even the right truck that I rented, $1.19 per mile, $7 for

02:35:34.280 --> 02:35:39.540
the dolly, and $5 convenience fee for a truck that, you know, I rented, I reserved a 14-foot

02:35:39.540 --> 02:35:42.700
truck, she gave me a gimp 10-foot truck with one headlight.

02:35:42.700 --> 02:35:47.700
Talk to your manager, write the Better Business Bureau, send a copy of the letter to her so

02:35:47.700 --> 02:35:52.020
you can send it to the Better Business Bureau and keep a damn copy.

02:35:52.020 --> 02:35:59.020
That's why I love having her around, because she'll just... she'll tell you how to fuck with somebody.

02:35:59.020 --> 02:36:02.020
I live to prove people wrong.

02:36:02.020 --> 02:36:07.020
Oh, and then to top it off, at the very end of when I got done dealing with her...

02:36:07.020 --> 02:36:10.020
Do you know I need high schoolers at my...

02:36:10.020 --> 02:36:13.020
We're here on the weekend with me?

02:36:13.020 --> 02:36:14.020
I'm like...

02:36:14.020 --> 02:36:15.020
U-Haul corporate.

02:36:15.020 --> 02:36:18.020
No one that I would want to subject you to.

02:36:18.020 --> 02:36:20.020
Anyways, that's all.

02:36:20.020 --> 02:36:22.020
Alright, moving on.

02:36:50.020 --> 02:36:51.020
I'm fine.

02:36:51.020 --> 02:36:52.020
What?

02:36:52.020 --> 02:36:53.020
Except for today.

02:36:53.020 --> 02:36:54.020
Today was great.

02:36:54.020 --> 02:36:59.500

telling you where at least on the air because that's just an embarrassment even to me

but I found out later through lab journal that the only reason that they

02:38:03.680 --> 02:38:09.040
were charging $50 to get into the place was the fact that they had some

02:38:09.040 --> 02:38:15.160

02:45:34.340 --> 02:45:38.080
Police for being the pigs that they are by holding the students down when they want to

Uh, DD Archaholic, last one, Daniel, uh, DD Archaholic's, uh, passing along one for Daniel.

Daniel says, F.U. to my ex-wife for making my life a living hell.

02:46:17.560 --> 02:46:20.480
And I think that's a good one to, uh, end the F.U. segment on exes.

02:46:20.480 --> 02:46:27.480
I have no pity for the people who haven't gotten their tax money yet. Sorry Jonas, cause I did mine like 3 months ago.

02:46:27.480 --> 02:46:32.480
And if he goes to taxes for not sending me my refunds yet, I filed my taxes like 2 months ago and still haven't got my refund.

02:46:32.480 --> 02:46:41.480
And if he did his dog for pissing on my tires, this is not piss my ride dammit!

02:46:41.480 --> 02:46:48.040
I have no pity for the people who haven't gotten their tax money yet, sorry Jonas, because

02:46:48.040 --> 02:46:54.440
I did mine like three months ago and I got my money two months ago.

02:46:54.440 --> 02:47:07.960
If you hop on it right when you get it and telephile, you get your money awfully fast.

02:47:07.960 --> 02:47:11.920
So I e-filed, and I had to owe, so does that mean they're not going to take out my money

02:47:11.920 --> 02:47:14.540
for another couple weeks?

02:47:14.540 --> 02:47:16.780
Do they take money out of your account?

02:47:16.780 --> 02:47:19.580
I end up owing all the time, because I have two main deductions.

02:47:19.580 --> 02:47:25.060
See, I always have zero, and this year I got, I don't want to brag, but my return was four

02:47:25.060 --> 02:47:26.060
digits.

02:47:26.060 --> 02:47:27.060
So, yeah.

02:47:27.060 --> 02:47:28.060
Yeah, see, that's what I need to do.

02:47:28.060 --> 02:47:29.060
But I have Max's holdings.

02:47:29.060 --> 02:47:30.060
I need to drop it down to like one.

02:47:30.060 --> 02:47:31.060
All right.

02:47:31.060 --> 02:47:37.880
I would also like to say that I now have no credit, we have no credit card debt.

02:47:37.880 --> 02:47:44.340

02:47:56.480 --> 02:47:59.620
the Orange Lawns radio book of course you know we've got a little bit of time

02:47:59.620 --> 02:48:02.780
left and what do we always do when we have a little time left at the end of

02:48:02.780 --> 02:48:06.780
Let's ask Orange Lounge a question.

02:48:06.780 --> 02:48:12.780
Can I ask you a question?

02:48:12.780 --> 02:48:15.780
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

02:48:15.780 --> 02:48:19.780
What will we find out tonight on Orange Lounge Radio?

02:48:19.780 --> 02:48:22.780
Will they ask about the studio since last week we are here?

02:48:22.780 --> 02:48:26.780
Or will they ask a question about the new place where we're gonna be?

02:48:26.780 --> 02:48:28.780
Or will they ask something else?

02:48:28.780 --> 02:48:32.780
WICKY WICKY!

02:48:32.780 --> 02:48:36.780
Excuse me, I want to ask you a few questions.

02:48:36.780 --> 02:48:43.780
Um, Elle Mullet, assuming Orange Lounge, the band,

02:48:43.780 --> 02:48:47.780
ever sued you and made you change your name,

02:48:47.780 --> 02:48:50.780
what would you call your station in its place?

02:48:50.780 --> 02:48:53.780
Uh, research that they can't sue us, ha ha ha,

02:48:53.780 --> 02:48:56.780
because it's not registered in the United States.

02:48:56.780 --> 02:49:00.640
it'll never happen he says yes it'll never happen but what if we'd have to

02:49:00.640 --> 02:49:07.640
name our lounge radio I say we name ourselves the big comfy couch radio

02:49:07.640 --> 02:49:14.360
station uh bananas in pajamas now nobody better steal this or I swear to God I'm

02:49:14.360 --> 02:49:17.020
gonna kick your ass but the standby title I had always thought of was game

02:49:17.020 --> 02:49:21.920
beat was the name so cuz you know beat mania I was thinking after the store

02:49:21.920 --> 02:49:26.060
that Dan owned game on that would be a good one too we haven't really ever sat

02:49:26.060 --> 02:49:30.000
down talked about this but Jamie Jamie's gonna kick your ass Jamie research the

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:33.680
trademark and since orange lounge actually is a trademark in the u.s. we

02:49:33.680 --> 02:49:38.180
can have it but Konami Konami knows what we're doing and they don't care we'll do

02:49:38.180 --> 02:49:42.680
what Kentucky Fried Chicken does and just call ourselves OLR that's possible as

02:49:42.680 --> 02:49:51.600
well so alright anyway let's see they're giving us all these Spanish names in

02:49:51.600 --> 02:49:52.920
I don't know what that is about.

02:49:52.920 --> 02:49:54.160
El Pantelon!

02:49:54.160 --> 02:49:55.720

02:49:55.720 --> 02:49:58.920
How many licks does it take to get to the center of Loki's pants?

02:49:58.920 --> 02:50:03.120
Well, hey, uh,

02:50:03.120 --> 02:50:06.520
you know, when there's only, when there's a giant gaping hole in them,

02:50:06.520 --> 02:50:11.400
one. That's not the question you need to be asking us. Yeah, honestly,

02:50:11.400 --> 02:50:15.360
uh, we'll, we will give you his girlfriend's email address and you can just ask her

02:50:15.360 --> 02:50:15.880
directly.

02:50:15.880 --> 02:50:20.120
Why you want to know this, I don't know.

02:50:20.120 --> 02:50:27.140
DJ Morpheus is suggesting, by the way, hi, The Peach Colored Booby Show, to which Dark

02:50:27.140 --> 02:50:29.260
Sakura is politely looking away.

02:50:29.260 --> 02:50:34.180
My response was dot, dot, dot in the chatroom.

02:50:34.180 --> 02:50:37.900
By the way, big thank you to DJ Morpheus for being funny.

02:50:37.900 --> 02:50:42.060
And check out his program, Undersedation Live, over on Live 365.

02:50:42.060 --> 02:50:43.940
It's actually linked right from our play page.

02:50:43.940 --> 02:50:44.940
It's on the bottom.

02:50:44.940 --> 02:50:45.940
So check it out.

02:50:45.940 --> 02:50:46.940
USL.

02:50:46.940 --> 02:50:48.560
730 Pacific Daylight Time.

02:50:48.560 --> 02:50:49.560
On Saturday.

02:50:49.560 --> 02:50:56.560
Indeed. See? Travis, you can't bullshit me anymore. I just, uh, yeah. I just gave you a shout-out, so there, bye.

02:50:57.560 --> 02:51:06.560
Alright. Uh, LXL Doobs. Why does everyone hate Stoics, Safari, etc. after the new 2DX?

02:51:06.560 --> 02:51:08.560
I don't hate Stoics, it's Taku.

02:51:08.560 --> 02:51:11.560
I'm sorry, I don't really follow 2DX.

02:51:11.560 --> 02:51:14.560
The Safari was never meant to be 150 BPM, that's why.

02:51:14.560 --> 02:51:18.960
That is actually a big reason why people have a beef with the Safari and the song Get On Beat.

02:51:18.960 --> 02:51:25.760
When they originally appeared in 3rd and 4th style respectively, they were about 40, about 130-ish.

02:51:25.760 --> 02:51:30.160
I've come close to actually beating them, and now I can't and never will.

02:51:30.160 --> 02:51:36.480
For some reason, and we have no idea why, but when 6th style came out, they sped them up to 160 BPM,

02:51:36.480 --> 02:51:40.960
which makes, and speeding up a song makes it harder in 2DX. You have to hit more keys in a minute,

02:51:40.960 --> 02:51:45.040
it just automatically makes the song harder. In fact, there was an another I was playing

02:51:45.040 --> 02:51:50.440
in 9th style the other day. The another is just the same damn song sped up. It's crazy.

02:51:50.440 --> 02:51:53.560
I can't even remember what it was, though. I think it's Distress, I want to say. I think

02:51:53.560 --> 02:51:57.660
it's Distress Another. It's just sped up. I know that there was one, I don't remember

02:51:57.660 --> 02:52:03.040
what it was that had, uh, freezes in it, or where it stopped, but in the another it, it

02:52:03.040 --> 02:52:06.840
like speeds up or something. I don't remember what song it was. I think it was on 4th style.

02:52:06.840 --> 02:52:11.120
although i don't think that it'll be no it wasn't going to know i don't have a

02:52:11.120 --> 02:52:13.320
good enough

02:52:13.320 --> 02:52:16.800
you know i was faster on uh... they did it both ways

02:52:16.800 --> 02:52:19.280
and it was uh...

02:52:19.280 --> 02:52:21.120
radical faith

02:52:21.120 --> 02:52:23.180
now was not a complete it was uh...

02:52:23.180 --> 02:52:26.160
that that was one of the talk is on

02:52:26.160 --> 02:52:29.480
and if you have a suggestion or chair of he says that they hate them because the

02:52:29.480 --> 02:52:33.000
note charts are total bullshit

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:36.360
and how i think i actually like the safari

02:52:36.360 --> 02:52:40.200
the song. Oh yeah, the songs are great. I mean, 2DX songs are sexy. Well, Get On Beat

02:52:40.200 --> 02:52:45.540
Wild Style makes me want to barf up, but... Although, sadly, I think like 5th, 6th, 7th

02:52:45.540 --> 02:52:49.360
for me was about the peak of 2DX music. I haven't been so into new ones. I think there's

02:52:49.360 --> 02:52:54.420
good stuff, though, in the later ones, but... I miss the 4th style booty dancers. We need

02:52:54.420 --> 02:52:59.360
more 4th style booty dancers. We need the chick in the bandana to come back and we need

02:52:59.360 --> 02:53:05.200
that weird looking guy. LXL Doobs also is asking, why didn't anybody have sex with the

02:53:05.200 --> 02:53:10.360
blow-up lamb that Jonas brought tonight because islanders going for it islanders

02:53:10.360 --> 02:53:15.600
going for it because some of us don't need to fake it some of us get it for

02:53:15.600 --> 02:53:23.800
real oh you can quote her on that well Islanders leaving officially violated

02:53:23.800 --> 02:53:24.800
Wow.

02:53:24.800 --> 02:53:25.800
Alright.

02:53:25.800 --> 02:53:41.040
Didi Archaholic says she wants to ask us if our favorite soda is still pineapple.

02:53:41.040 --> 02:53:44.840
I think she's asking me specifically, is your favorite soda still pineapple?

02:53:44.840 --> 02:53:47.380
Pineapple Crush specifically is my favorite soda.

02:53:47.380 --> 02:53:50.080
I am warming up to other brands because I don't make Pineapple Crush anymore.

02:53:50.080 --> 02:53:52.300
I'm warming up to other brands of pineapple soda.

02:53:52.300 --> 02:53:53.300
But I find I...

02:53:53.300 --> 02:53:55.300
by Pineapple Crush in the ghetto.

02:53:55.300 --> 02:53:57.300
Well, I gotta go...

02:53:57.300 --> 02:53:59.300
Go down to Del Paso.

02:53:59.300 --> 02:54:01.300
I need to go, because I miss Pineapple Crush.

02:54:01.300 --> 02:54:03.300
It was the best. I do still like Pineapple Crush.

02:54:03.300 --> 02:54:05.300
She says her favorite is melon soda.

02:54:05.300 --> 02:54:07.300
I am developing a fond

02:54:07.300 --> 02:54:09.300
likeness for chocolate soda, though.

02:54:09.300 --> 02:54:11.300
Ramené.

02:54:11.300 --> 02:54:13.300
Because it explodes. I love watching people who've

02:54:13.300 --> 02:54:15.300
never drunk ramené before, and watching

02:54:15.300 --> 02:54:17.300
it explode all over them.

02:54:17.300 --> 02:54:19.300
Pineapple is the one way you can get

02:54:19.300 --> 02:54:21.300
me to break my rule of only diet sodas.

02:54:21.300 --> 02:54:24.620
For those who don't know, I actually gave up regular sodas in favor of diet sodas and

02:54:24.620 --> 02:54:25.620
really water.

02:54:25.620 --> 02:54:28.620
I drink water more than anything else.

02:54:28.620 --> 02:54:31.620
About two years ago now, it's been a while, damn, it's really been that long, it was about

02:54:31.620 --> 02:54:33.620
two years ago I gave up soda.

02:54:33.620 --> 02:54:36.140
So pineapple's the only thing that would get me to drink regular soda, otherwise I stick

02:54:36.140 --> 02:54:37.900
with pretty much diets.

02:54:37.900 --> 02:54:40.900
Diet cream soda is the best though, because it tastes like regular cream soda, it really

02:54:40.900 --> 02:54:41.900
does.

02:54:41.900 --> 02:54:43.100
You know what I should do one day?

02:54:43.100 --> 02:54:49.420
Get some pineapple sugar-free Torani, and some half and half, and some soda water, and

02:54:49.420 --> 02:54:50.980
make pineapple Italian cream sodas.

02:54:50.980 --> 02:54:55.420
would love you I would love you okay we got oh we only got a little bit of show

02:54:55.420 --> 02:54:58.620
left I got to make sure we get some of these other questions here illusion I

02:54:58.620 --> 02:55:03.280

02:56:15.800 --> 02:56:25.800
The first time we will have that much fun on a show will be either episode 187 or episode 420, if we make it that far.

02:56:25.800 --> 02:56:32.800
You know we will. We are here to stay because my ego will not let us quit.

02:56:32.800 --> 02:56:43.800
You know, I don't, I think that I have fun every week, so every week is a shining star in my memory.

02:56:43.800 --> 02:56:48.480
fire bomb asked a follow-up question do do I like dr. pepper cherry vanilla

there because it wasn't out here yet and I was like okay I'll try something new I

02:57:09.360 --> 02:57:16.000
I drank probably an ounce of my 20 ounce bottle and threw it away.

02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:18.960
I didn't even pour it out because the poor plants would have died.

02:57:18.960 --> 02:57:25.680
Legend of Zaku wants to know, will the ferrets have their own bar and love making pad in the new place?

02:57:25.680 --> 02:57:28.640
Um, no.

02:57:28.640 --> 02:57:32.040
We'll try to think of something special for the ferrets, but we don't have any plans yet.

02:57:32.040 --> 02:57:35.360
I guess that's the best answer I have for that, sorry.

02:57:35.360 --> 02:57:43.880
you know my I'm so disappointed that my evil gateway the hell machine so broken

02:57:43.880 --> 02:57:55.120

02:58:03.760 --> 02:58:09.100
it's just gonna be a new chapter but the final ask orange lounge of this studio

02:58:09.100 --> 02:58:13.480

fact the show sounds okay again

02:59:03.920 --> 02:59:06.720
i think if you could take pictures to get a camera that will put on our

02:59:06.720 --> 02:59:08.760
website now to create

02:59:08.760 --> 02:59:10.040
the cn studio

02:59:10.040 --> 02:59:12.880
and none of me because i've never

02:59:12.880 --> 02:59:16.240
okay i'm going to take one picture after the show book

02:59:16.240 --> 02:59:17.560
this is a completely dirty

02:59:17.560 --> 02:59:20.640
well that we ought to cram into the kitchen

02:59:20.640 --> 02:59:23.560
i will be in the pictures because i'm not supposed to be

02:59:23.560 --> 02:59:27.720

02:59:27.720 --> 02:59:29.000
okay anyway on

02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:30.240
so that's it

02:59:30.240 --> 02:59:31.360
and thus

02:59:31.360 --> 02:59:38.440
is the end of episode 139, when we come back, season 6, episode 140.

02:59:38.440 --> 02:59:39.920
We are starting over.

02:59:39.920 --> 02:59:42.760
New studio, new sound for the station.

02:59:42.760 --> 02:59:44.960
Orange launch radio, what gamers really want.

02:59:44.960 --> 02:59:49.320
Should I be disturbed that Jonas can put his entire fist in his mouth?

02:59:49.320 --> 02:59:51.180
I don't know.

02:59:51.180 --> 02:59:56.240
Once again, to end the show on a sappy note, thank you guys to the listeners.

02:59:56.240 --> 02:59:57.820
We do this because of you guys.

02:59:57.820 --> 02:59:59.760
You guys rock, honestly.

02:59:59.760 --> 03:00:03.040
Some of you guys have been supporting the station since episode one.

03:00:03.040 --> 03:00:06.520
Some of you guys, I know like, just there's folks that have been listening since episode

03:00:06.520 --> 03:00:07.520
one.

03:00:07.520 --> 03:00:08.520
Some of you guys haven't been listening.

03:00:08.520 --> 03:00:11.720
A lot of guys didn't come on board until, remember when we had the Urain premiere?

03:00:11.720 --> 03:00:13.480
We got a lot of new people that night.

03:00:13.480 --> 03:00:14.480
That was very awesome.

03:00:14.480 --> 03:00:18.400
So thanks again to Mel B for helping hook us up with that.

03:00:18.400 --> 03:00:19.400
And-

03:00:19.400 --> 03:00:20.400
You totally pimped, all right.

03:00:20.400 --> 03:00:21.400
Miklotov.

03:00:21.400 --> 03:00:26.100
Miklotov as well, because that really expanded our fan base.

03:00:26.100 --> 03:00:30.100
A big thank you to DDR Freak Radio, who we've been doing more work with in the past year,

03:00:30.100 --> 03:00:35.100
showing that two stations with similar interests can work together for the common good.

03:00:35.100 --> 03:00:42.100
And also a big thank you to under sedation live, for which none of this, if under sedation live did not exist,

03:00:42.100 --> 03:00:44.100
probably none of this would exist either.

03:00:44.100 --> 03:00:45.100
We love you.

03:00:45.100 --> 03:00:48.100
So, anything else?

03:00:48.100 --> 03:00:51.100
Since we're not going to get to do an acceptance speech at the best of awards, probably.

03:00:51.100 --> 03:00:53.100
This one is bullshit!

03:00:53.100 --> 03:01:03.420
going yourself just go with yourself we will be here next week with a show it

03:01:03.420 --> 03:01:07.100

03:01:07.100 --> 03:01:12.300

03:01:19.340 --> 03:01:22.280
mike to get started properly

03:01:22.280 --> 03:01:23.720
uh... well

03:01:23.720 --> 03:01:26.880
uh... i just hope that in this next place that we have uh...

03:01:26.880 --> 03:01:28.800
watch you have some furniture set up

03:01:28.800 --> 03:01:32.640
you know what that is the next two years actually smaller

03:01:32.640 --> 03:01:36.520
just for like computers in orange lounge so that's kind of a trade-off

03:01:36.520 --> 03:01:40.720
but you know it was a lot more fun at the old house where we all had to be on

03:01:40.720 --> 03:01:43.200
top of it's going to be that again it's going to be that again

03:01:43.200 --> 03:01:45.960
okay just for that you got a like mountain twister map on the back of the

03:01:45.960 --> 03:01:49.500
with but with that better ventilation

03:01:49.500 --> 03:01:52.660
and there's a window right there it's gonna be nice

03:01:52.660 --> 03:01:56.380
but yeah for uh... going five seasons try guys say man this is a pretty cool

03:01:56.380 --> 03:01:57.580
setup and

03:01:57.580 --> 03:02:01.020
i mean on behalf of the year spot one you know give you uh... lots of props

03:02:01.020 --> 03:02:02.660
for keeping this thing going

03:02:02.660 --> 03:02:05.640
army you probably do a hell of a lot better than we do on the upkeep but hey

03:02:05.640 --> 03:02:07.980
anything we can do like they say on

03:02:07.980 --> 03:02:12.100
as far as from spot standpoint if uh... we can't win the race will help the

03:02:12.100 --> 03:02:14.140

03:02:14.140 --> 03:02:21.140
Thank you, buddy. I appreciate that. Thank you. Thank you. That's so sweet. And, you know, Mel has not only done a lot for the station, but he's also helped me out a lot, personally, as well.

He did our first promo. He did. He was our first celebrity promo. And we've been running that promo ever since.

Islander, behind you.

03:03:45.040 --> 03:03:46.040
Final thoughts?

03:03:46.040 --> 03:03:50.720
Yeah, it was fun here, the few times that I've been here, and I'm really looking forward

03:03:50.720 --> 03:03:57.800
to doing this again, being here, hanging out, and checking out the new place when it's ready.

03:03:57.800 --> 03:03:58.800
All right.

03:03:58.800 --> 03:03:59.800
Angel.

03:03:59.800 --> 03:04:05.200
Although I haven't been listening since episode one, I have been listening since episode 26.

03:04:05.200 --> 03:04:06.840
Been good times since then.

03:04:06.840 --> 03:04:10.960
good times at this place and hope to continue it when we get to the new

03:04:10.960 --> 03:04:16.360
studio uh... good times come here we go

03:04:16.360 --> 03:04:21.200
i'll be honest this is a big hole okay the whole apartment is falling apart

03:04:21.200 --> 03:04:23.080
i mean there's mold in my room

03:04:23.080 --> 03:04:28.120
and the windows falling off the peephole god damn shot out at me today

03:04:28.120 --> 03:04:30.160
well no not today but the other day

03:04:30.160 --> 03:04:33.720
there's a rat rotting out in front of our apartment i forgot to mention that

03:04:33.720 --> 03:04:35.960
eww i saw the rat

03:04:35.960 --> 03:04:43.220
It's a goddamn hole, but the other place will be a lot better. So, you know, whatever what you make do with what we have and

03:04:44.340 --> 03:04:50.860
Yeah, I gotta still pack some more and I have my laundry going that's never going to be dry in time by the time Nellie

03:04:50.860 --> 03:04:52.860
picks me up and oh

03:04:53.220 --> 03:04:55.220
Damn it. I hate this week

03:04:55.220 --> 03:05:01.740
Dark Sakura. Oh, you want me to go? They have a request to hear the grudge sound real fast.

03:05:01.740 --> 03:05:09.300
Thank you. You know, I'm going to have to show this to you. In the new place, in my

03:05:09.300 --> 03:05:14.220
new roommates, who by the way, has never been on this show and has no idea what to expect,

03:05:14.220 --> 03:05:18.940
my new roommate. He's a gamer, though. He likes Donkey Konga. He loves that game. So

03:05:18.940 --> 03:05:23.060
we'll see what happens. My new roommate, in his bedroom, he has the master bedroom in

03:05:23.060 --> 03:05:28.500
In his bedroom, there's actually a little cutout that goes to the attic type thing,

03:05:28.500 --> 03:05:29.500
and I did that the other night.

03:05:29.500 --> 03:05:32.820
I started going, uh, and now he says he can't sleep.

03:05:32.820 --> 03:05:39.180
You know, one of Dan's assistant managers at GameStop said that that sound is made by

03:05:39.180 --> 03:05:43.660
the vocal cords that control your high pitch and your low pitch, that if you can make that

03:05:43.660 --> 03:05:46.020
noise, it means you have a very good vocal capacity.

03:05:46.020 --> 03:05:49.340
So, like, gotta get me to sing karaoke.

03:05:49.340 --> 03:05:50.340
All right.

03:05:50.340 --> 03:05:53.940
final thought is again guys I know this is sounding like a last show but it is

03:05:53.940 --> 03:06:01.780
not over we are starting over I'm gonna go with what I've been going with lately

03:06:01.780 --> 03:06:06.500
reject false icons think for yourself decide what you like all right

03:06:06.500 --> 03:06:15.660
Islander angels fly because they take themselves lightly all right all right

03:06:15.660 --> 03:06:20.580
