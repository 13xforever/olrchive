A little new sound there, a little bit of a new intro there.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I know we changed things up a little bit around here.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,240
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky. Joining me as always, my awesome co-host

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,920
here with me to talk about video games that don't suck. Say hello to

11
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,640
Jamie, also known as DarkSakura. There's plenty of games out there that suck.

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,160
Avoid them, please. Please, we beg you to. Don't give them any more money.

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,600
And also with us, as always, say hello to Loki.

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,880
Hi, I'm here again. Yes, you are. Yes.

15
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,600
All right, so you notice we kind of changed things a little bit there in the

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,240
intro you know I'm sure as a lot of you have noticed we haven't been talking a

17
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,560
whole lot about rhythm and music games here on the podcast so we kind of

18
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,640
thought we'd refocus ourselves a little bit and you know tell you guys what we're

19
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,720
really all about and that's just kind of general video gaming what gamers really

20
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,360
want to know about so now if you're a DDR fan you know don't get upset because

21
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,560
we're still going to talk about rhythm and music games plenty on this show when

22
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,280
we find out you know that a lot of stuff is going on new stuff in the world we

23
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,900
We will bring it to you as soon as we find out, but for now, we're going to talk about

24
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,220
other types of video games.

25
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,400
For instance, the types of games we've been playing this week.

26
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,400
Start off with Dark Sakura.

27
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,920
How's your gaming week been?

28
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:42,600
Um, other than the typical, you know, widescreen pong, not much, really.

29
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,600
I don't know.

30
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,720
I play with my new phone a bit, my new phone that angers me so much.

31
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,720
Like cell phone gaming?

32
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,280
No, I don't, I usually delete all the stupid games off of my cell phone.

33
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,120
Have you seen some of those games you can download on the cell phone, though?

34
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,400
I have Bejeweled on my phone.

35
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,120
And I know we were talking about this a little bit last week.

36
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,680
Remember we were talking about in the last podcast about the Chinese cell phone games

37
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,540
that you can get that are just like, you can get Life Force?

38
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,540
You can get them in Japan.

39
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,540
Yeah.

40
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,040
Like, I want that Final Fantasy VII game.

41
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,040
Heck yeah.

42
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,040
The Turks game.

43
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,040
Heck yeah.

44
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,040
But, you know, the best thing we get, you know, I have Impossible Mission, which was,

45
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,040
don't get me wrong, one of the greatest Commodore 64 games of all time, but it sucks on the

46
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,040
cell phone.

47
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,040
You can't even see the room.

48
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,600
They do have Gradius for the US phone, I found out, but it's not for anything I think that

49
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:30,360
we have and they shoot there was a game that I was thinking when you said

50
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,240
impossible mission I think they should put incredible crisis that'd be cool I

51
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,040
don't have all the music on there though but who knows what technology is so any

52
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,640
other games that's it just cell phones that's really it all right fair enough

53
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,640
Loki what do you been up to I've been playing my PSP then what I do I was

54
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:56,060
Was mainly playing Wipeout Pure only because my boss was borrowing the Twisted Metal head

55
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,640
on because he doesn't have any games for his so I felt bad for him so I loaned him that

56
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,240
for a few days.

57
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,040
So I've been playing Wipeout Pure and it's pretty fun.

58
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:12,080
I actually hated Wipeout and I don't know, it's nice right now while I have one game.

59
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,040
I'm getting more games coming down on Monday so I'll have Luminous and Ridge Racer finally

60
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:23,880
and then 512 megabyte memory sticks so I can put all my pirated episodes of Robot Chicken

61
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:30,160
on there. That's my favorite. Then the other game I got was Zookeeper for the DS and I

62
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,220
can see why I didn't get it before because it's kind of annoying. Like I actually had

63
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,940
to turn the background music off on it because it was that annoying. Just repeated like every

64
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:45,920
five seconds and it's just awful. Now I've been checking out Zookeeper too since you

65
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,720
picked it up which basically zookeepers just bejeweled on the DS like one minor

66
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,560
change that's the animal theme and that's about it so it's basically bejeweled

67
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,640
doesn't it feel like one of those games that was really rushed to come out just

68
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,360
because there are no other games out on the DS so yeah people would buy it yes

69
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,760
exactly it's what it is because there's like no depth to it it's just like ooh

70
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,800
it's a game I can pick up play for a little bit and I'm done actually I

71
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,880
honestly I got it for my fiance because she wanted a game that she can

72
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:21,520
play that's easy so I see how it is so I got her that so she'd stop bitching so

73
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,720
yeah it's been that that in Final Fantasy 11 of course and played a little

74
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,640
Katamari Damacy today just it just because I was listening to the

75
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,920
soundtrack and it's like oh okay I'll play that again because you know they're

76
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,760
working on all well they announced you know obviously the release date for

77
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,660
Katamari Damacy 2 in Japan in Japan yeah but I'm sure it'll make its way over

78
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:48,260
over here. Damn well better. And so I just had to play it just for fun. So I did that.

79
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:53,380
Right on. Yeah. My gaming week, I was also playing the zookeeper on the DS and I was

80
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,460
kind of meh. I think I played it for about five minutes and I was like I've played this

81
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,980
game before. Bejeweled 2 is cooler than zookeeper. Why don't they put Bejeweled 2 on the DS?

82
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:05,100
At least you got like the super jewels and things like that. And it's got like a better

83
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,500
theme where a zookeeper gets eh eh eh. You know the bleeps and bloops. It sounds like

84
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,140
Atari 2600. It's hella annoying. The other game I got to check out this week, thanks

85
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:18,740
to Loki actually, managed to snag me a copy of Doom 3 on the Xbox, which, you know, I

86
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,700
have to admit, I wasn't really interested in Doom 3 at all. I mean, I guess it's hard

87
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,380
because I really liked Doom and Doom 2 when they were out years ago. You remember how

88
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:33,180
they were like the first, like, first person games? They were kind of like this sequel

89
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,500
to Wolfenstein in a way, in a way, not really, but they were kind of like the next evolution

90
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,500
It was Wolfenstein with ramps. Well, not really ramps, actually.

91
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,500
Well, and then multiplayer, which was really cool.

92
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,500
Well, you remember, like, if you ever created your own maps in Wolfenstein, it's very 2D.

93
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,500
Wolfenstein is really, it's like you take a 2D level and you put yourself in it.

94
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,500
I remember doing that.

95
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,500
But Doom was very 3D. That's where it was coming from.

96
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,500
And it had the Wolfenstein level.

97
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,500
It did. It did.

98
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:05,500
It had to do the level skip code, but you could get there. I believe it was level 40-something?

99
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:10,940
It was one of the levels that was actually Wolfenstein was actually in Doom, it was cool.

100
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:16,180
But I don't know, for some reason now I'm kind of jaded by this over amount of first

101
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,780
person shooters and I'm kind of like, sure I'll play Halo once in a while because it's

102
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,300
a good game, but I don't get into a whole lot of others.

103
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,060
So I have to admit I was kind of like, it seems a little late for Doom 3, I'm not that

104
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:30,580
excited about it, but I was actually pleasantly surprised with Doom 3.

105
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,220
It's quite more to it than I thought.

106
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,140
It's not like the other Dooms where you just jump in, start shooting.

107
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,300
Even Halo's a lot like that.

108
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,860
Sure, Halo has its big cinematic opening, but it's kind of really just jump in, start

109
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,860
shooting.

110
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:48,180
But Halo also has, Halo 2 anyway, has where you can take the vehicles and completely abandon

111
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,980
the game and fly around and go places you're not supposed to go.

112
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,660
There's plenty of differences between Halo 2 and Doom 3.

113
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,460
I'm not going to try and compare the two, but I'm just kind of, you know, I think a

114
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,740
lot of times because they're first person shooters, we kind of inadvertently compare

115
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,740
them.

116
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,340
it wasn't just jump in and go, it was kind of like a, you know, move around, talk to

117
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:11,060
people, almost like a quest in the beginning, and then you start killing things and zombies

118
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,660
and stuff, and it gets really scary too.

119
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:17,760
Like I remember the way you would get scared with Doom 2 is that, you know, you'd have

120
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:22,020
to play with all the lights off, and then with the headphones on, and like the pixelated

121
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:26,340
monster jumps out from behind you, but now with Doom 3, it's really scary, there's like

122
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,900
bodies hanging from ceilings and zombies that jump up from the floor and stuff, it's pretty

123
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,900
freaky.

124
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,900
I need to see this.

125
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,900
I really do.

126
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,900
I'm going to have to show this to you.

127
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,900
It's pretty cool.

128
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,900
Wasn't it on PC as well?

129
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,900
Yes.

130
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,900
It actually started on PC, but Xbox has...

131
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,600
I think I have it somewhere hanging around my house.

132
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,060
The cool thing about Doom 3 on Xbox is it has the Xbox Live stuff in it, although I

133
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,300
don't know anybody else with the game, so I can't play anybody yet.

134
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,300
And yeah, and they'll see the other thing is that it runs on your console without having

135
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,300
to buy a new graphics card, new processor...

136
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,300
Exactly.

137
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,800
It's built for the Xbox.

138
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,840
And it actually looks pretty damn good.

139
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,740
One thing I really like about Doom 3 is that it's got an incredible detail level.

140
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:07,620
Like when you want to look at the access panel to a door, okay in most games it's just like

141
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,360
a little green light or a red light and it turns green, but like in this one you can

142
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,680
actually walk up to it and then zoom in and it seamlessly is zooming in and you actually

143
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,720
can see like a number pad that you have to punch in an access code to get through the

144
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,720
door.

145
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,720
It's crazy.

146
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,720
Pretty insane.

147
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,720
Yeah.

148
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,580
it anyway so that's pretty much my game

149
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,980
well that and there's like these panels

150
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,260
that you walk around that like have

151
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,900
video playing it's like an actual like

152
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,980
video talking about the whole facility

153
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,180
that welcome to Mars and don't get

154
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:42,020
killed welcome to recall alright let's

155
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,300
start off with some gaming news tonight

156
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,620
I'll actually talk about another game

157
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,820
that's on its way towards Xbox this is

158
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,520
an update for an old classic comic strip

159
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,100
and this was a game of one time as well

160
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,540
I remember this one you remember spy

161
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:59,460
versus Spy. Oh my god I have Spy vs. Spy comics in my bathroom. Exactly you had

162
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,780
Mad Magazine right and then it you know spun off but it was an old-school

163
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:07,060
Commodore 64 game too. It came out on the NES. Yeah it was on the NES as well I remember there were like

164
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:11,740
three versions on the Commodore it was an awesome game. Well now it's out on the Xbox and of

165
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:16,180
course Spy vs. Spy being based on the comic slapstick humor and all that you

166
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,140
get the white spy versus the black spy so in the game you are going to become a

167
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:24,860
spy obviously and you attempt to outwit up to three opponents so I don't know

168
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:29,340
how that really works blue spy red spy I guess I don't know you go across the

169
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:33,540
game's 12 levels there's weapons booby traps and gadgets it's kind of sounds

170
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,420
very similar to the other one the other cool thing about spy versus spy though

171
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,140
and I always like it when game companies do this it's a 1999 title so they're

172
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:45,420
starting this off as a budget and there's a reason why it's 1999 cuz you

173
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:51,340
get what you pay for people. Hey we paid $19.99 for Katamari Damacy. That's right. Yeah that's

174
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:55,420
right but you know what that was one of those exceptions to the rule okay. I thought Technic

175
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:00,420
Beat which came out the same time was very cool as well. Maybe a $29 game. Come on Rup

176
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:06,020
this is Spy vs Spy. Spy vs Spy for the NES suck. I have a fond place in my heart for

177
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:10,500
the Spy vs Spy Commodore games because I was a kid when those were out and it was great.

178
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,980
Horrible reviews. I don't even think anyone actually wanted to review this game. Well

179
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,560
I'll tell you though well here's the thing that might make you go kind of

180
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,640
maybe this is a crappy game don't know yet though PlayStation 2 version got

181
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:27,200
canceled they decide not to do it seems very interesting yeah I think I would

182
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,320
have to get spy versus by just because yeah I know it's gonna be the just

183
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,800
because factor and that not get it for 30% off someone should send me a free

184
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,500
one I like that idea I'll just get it for cheap if you have a free copy spy

185
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,580
versus spy you want to send us to go t-o-g-o at orange launch radio.com in

186
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,420
fact you could really write us about anything well we'll read whatever emails

187
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:52,800
you got to send us um let's talk old-school consoles for a minute I

188
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,660
think this is really cool this story it talks about the Atari 2600 can you

189
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,620
believe there's still new Atari 2600 news after all these years hey people

190
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:08,020
are still making ROMs for the 2600 well you got it here it is retro redo it was

191
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:13,960
a 24-hour video game programming contest held last weekend in New York and so

192
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,640
there were nine teams that were doing this and they were all making new games

193
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,620
and they were given away these awards for the best visuals, most innovative, the

194
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:25,560
best sound. You want to know the name of the game that won it all? Do tell. Ninja

195
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:31,540
Garden. What? Ninja Garden. Okay. This is the game that won it all but here's the

196
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:35,520
cool thing as a prize you know how they have those Atari flashback consoles now

197
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,520
I've seen that.

198
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,520
It's like 50 bucks!

199
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,520
But, okay, whatever.

200
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:53,520
The prize is, is that this game, Ninja Garden, is going to be included in the next version

201
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,520
of that.

202
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,520
Huh, pretty cool.

203
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,080
It's kind of the, you know, new, secret game.

204
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,040
Truth be told, people, you could actually probably pull a chip out of one of those that

205
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,840
actually flash any ROMs you want on there, but whatever.

206
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,440
that we encourage you to break your warranty and do that.

207
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,600
Oh, come on, a warranty on a $20 item.

208
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,280
Woo, got to replace that one.

209
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,280
Are they releasing that thing with the wood paneling?

210
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,720
No, it's not.

211
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,240
You know it's not the old wood panel style

212
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,360
we had way back in the day.

213
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:18,920
It's the kind that I have.

214
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,320
It's a cheap, cheap plastic.

215
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,600
The third release one, right?

216
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,480
Exactly.

217
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,120
Well, I don't even know if it exactly

218
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,680
looks like one of those, but.

219
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,760
From old system to very new system, PSP, a lot of folks

220
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,320
were saying, oh, it sold great.

221
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:38,240
the best system ever in sales and some people were saying at disappointing well

222
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,720
the first week sales figures are out now and the PSP sold six hundred thousand

223
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,520
units in its first week you know what that oh yeah you know what that equates

224
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:52,400
to about a hundred and fifty million dollars good then so you'll be able to

225
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:59,720
pay that ninety million dollars off yeah we'll see we'll see about that one all

226
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:06,400
Alright, also in other handheld gaming news, Nintendo's got this DS, you might have heard

227
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,560
of this new game on the way for the DS, it's called Electroplankton, I've never heard about

228
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,720
this at all.

229
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,080
They have like, I thought there was like a website for this or something, yeah they do

230
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,740
have a website out there for it, but it's kind of like a, it's one of those things they're

231
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:26,680
saying it's not really a game, but it's one of those like music type drawing and you get

232
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,800
the music beats, and I don't really know how to describe this until I play it, but I know

233
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,460
it's getting a lot of buzz around it.

234
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,080
But they're doing an interesting promotion here, Nintendo is.

235
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,920
What they're going to be doing, they're actually going to have an aquarium exhibition hall

236
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,200
at this Tokyo show from April 8th to 14th.

237
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,240
Entrance is free, and you get to see the whole thing.

238
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:53,160
And the cool thing about this is Nintendo's going to be giving away only 10 limited edition

239
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,640
electroplankton ds units should be interesting

240
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,840
and by the looks of it I am it pretty much looks exactly like a normal ds

241
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,200
except there's this whole sticker on it

242
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,800
it might be an engraving though you know engraving whatever it

243
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,240
at sliding but anyways it's just

244
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,240
it's actually actually what that is it is an engraving it's the original

245
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,840
electroplankton artwork

246
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,920
so whoever's gonna get that they're gonna put it on friggin eBay it's gonna sell

247
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,520
for a lot

248
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,680
Yeah, we'll see, we'll see. Speaking of Nintendo,

249
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,160
you know how we have in San Francisco, now we, you know, we based our show out of

250
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,580
Sacramento, so San Francisco's just a drive up the road,

251
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,180
and in San Francisco they have the official Sony PlayStation Store at the

252
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,740
Sony Metron. You've been there before, right?

253
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:39,660
Yeah. It's fun, huh? It's a big geek place. Oh yeah. The whole Metron is just geek central.

254
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:43,460
It's cool. And with overpriced games. And overpriced food. But still, it's fun,

255
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,580
you know. Well, if you're on the other coast,

256
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,700
there's a gaming company that's going to be doing something similar for you guys.

257
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:59,200
in New York City, Rockefeller Center will soon be home to the Nintendo World Store,

258
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:06,640
a two story complex, Mario, Zelda, Nintendo, you think of it, also the location will host

259
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:13,960
the brand-new Pokemon Center joy joy joy can we like leave our kids there put

260
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,080
them in pokeball just like people are gonna do that anyway you know it's gonna

261
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:25,800
happen I'm really surprised doing it in Seattle since the Nintendo headquarters

262
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:31,160
is just north of Tacoma that is kind of surprising to me but you know it's fun

263
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,900
to try stuff on the other coast too I mean we get spoiled here on the west

264
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:38,060
coast sometimes with all these technology things so you know I grew up

265
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:43,420
in Alabama I'm not complaining I was gonna say you know it's also over well

266
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,380
not exactly on the East Coast with the West Coast by the you know Microsoft you

267
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:51,620
know they've got to have their you know yeah so this is thing okay if Sony has

268
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:56,900
chosen San Francisco and Nintendo has chosen New York where's Microsoft gonna

269
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:08,180
go hopefully Alaska no I'm kidding I'm kidding the South Pole probably LA who

270
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:14,240
knows we'll see now Jamie I know you're a big fan of Namco the company right why

271
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,040
are you such a fan of Namco I worked for them oh so you saw a lot of company

272
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:23,720
loyalty I had the coolest uniform shirt ever it was red and black and had

273
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:30,040
Pac-Man on it. What's the coolest thing about Namco? Anything Tekken related.

274
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:36,220
Alright, well what's actually coming out on the PlayStation 2 is NAMM collection.

275
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:40,600
They've actually pushed this back though. It's gonna come out in Japan on June 2nd

276
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,160
but it actually got pushed back a little bit. What is the NAMM collection? It's gonna

277
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:49,760
be five classic PlayStation games. It's gonna be Ridge Racer, Ace Combat 2,

278
00:16:49,760 --> 00:17:06,440
The compilation is also going to have a gallery mode and movies with tips and tricks on how

279
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,440
to get through the game.

280
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:14,600
You remember on the old Playstation they had the NAMCO, it sounds like they are doing that

281
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,680
all over again but now for the newer games because Playstation, believe it or not, is

282
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:25,520
getting to be like 10 years old it's kind of sad you know this sounds like a

283
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:31,040
desperate attempt at money well isn't isn't everything come on if you want to

284
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,760
play Tekken go buy Tekken 5 I mean because you have no Tekken in there

285
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,680
that's true but it's just like okay it's like how Nintendo released those retro

286
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,600
games that are available on the advance and one of the games you can buy is

287
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,600
Metroid but hello spend ten more dollars and you could get Metroid zero mission

288
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,260
to talk about games all the time because you know if we talked about games all

289
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:27,980
the time we'd have no time to go clubbing so what we're here to do as

290
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:31,440
well is we're here to better your life and who better to give you some advice

291
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,640
on how to better your life than our very own dark Sakura with her advice column

292
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:43,860
and Jamie what are you gonna tell the kids about tonight well this one I think

293
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:48,860
think is very, very useful. One that everybody needs to know.

294
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,860
And what's this? How to treat a bullet or knife wound.

295
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:56,860
Ah, okay. Because you know, it always happens when you get in one of those heated,

296
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:01,860
soul-calor battles where someone ends up getting cut in the end.

297
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:05,860
So this is good to know. Well, you ready?

298
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:10,860
Of course. Number one, do not immediately pull out any impaled objects.

299
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:16,860
The object may be pressed against an artery or other vital internal structure and may actually be helping to reduce the bleeding.

300
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:46,620
Now I know why that doesn't happen precisely. I learned something today. Anyway, sorry number two

301
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:54,220
Control the bleeding by using a combination of direct pressure limb elevation pressure points and tourniquets in that order

302
00:19:54,580 --> 00:20:00,940
three and mobilize the injured area using splints and dressings to immobilize an injured area helps protect the

303
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:07,340
From further injury and maintain clots that have begun to form for dress the wound and strive to prevent infection

304
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:13,700
infection doesn't say how. That means dump a bottle of vodka on their legs. Um, five,

305
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,860
get medical attention as soon as possible. But of course, you know what I always say

306
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:24,440
in the end? Yes? Don't get shot, stupid duck! Thank you very much for that lovely piece

307
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:30,700
of advice. Well, it's, people, if bullets are flying, freaking hide. If somebody runs

308
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:35,460
a gun, or if somebody pulls a gun, you run, like a little bitch. Exactly. Of course, you

309
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,500
usually end up getting shot in the back.

310
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,580
You won't care!

311
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,180
Be careful.

312
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:46,540
Speaking of getting shot, you remember how the Godfather, the movie, had a game come

313
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,180
out pretty recently?

314
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,100
They made, like, the Godfather game.

315
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:54,980
Well, did you know that the Godfather game did not have everybody's blessing in coming

316
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,980
out?

317
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,280
In fact, some people are quite irritated about this game coming out.

318
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,620
You know who one of the folks is that's pretty irritated about it?

319
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:07,580
Francis Ford Coppola, who made the damn movies, is not happy about this.

320
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:17,000
So he's expressed his displeasure with Paramount Pictures because they ended up selling the

321
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,440
rights out.

322
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:23,380
He's actually going to talk about this on an AMC show called Sunday Morning Shootout.

323
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,840
This is what he says, I knew nothing about it.

324
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,220
They never asked me if I thought it was a good idea.

325
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,820
They use the characters, everyone knows, and then for the next hour they shoot and kill

326
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,820
each other.

327
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,260
I had absolutely nothing to do with this game, and I disapprove.

328
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:41,100
Well yeah, that's why they didn't tell you about it, because it's going to suck.

329
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,820
Like you'd actually approve that.

330
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,940
That's the whole point, I mean, it's never going to work out.

331
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:52,700
But hey, that's alright, we'll have a nice Grand Theft Auto clone.

332
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,100
Phantasy Star.

333
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,380
Some of you guys have played this out there, I know you used to play this a while ago,

334
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:01,380
Sakura I've played it on and off it seems like I can never keep going with

335
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:05,940
Phantasy Star online enough to go past like level 10 or 11 but maybe I'll get

336
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,620
my chance when Phantasy Star universe comes out because it did just get

337
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:14,220
confirmed for the US and it's gonna be out spring of 2006 it's gonna be out on

338
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:23,700
the PC and the PlayStation 2 notice not Xbox not GameCube at least initially so

339
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,140
you know you might have been wondering if this game was gonna come over but it

340
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:31,820
definitely is of course this is being developed by Sega and it's only gonna be

341
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:37,660
out though on the PlayStation 2 and the PC so hopefully it will have nothing to

342
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:43,180
do with Phantasy Star Online volume 3 which was like the card game which was

343
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:48,620
the suck hopefully it'll go back to the regular one we need blue burst the

344
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:52,540
single-player campaign is expected to clock in at roughly 40 hours of play

345
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:57,500
with three planets to explore and new enemies to fight gamers no longer have

346
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,260
to go around on foot because there's actually gonna be vehicles in the game

347
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:07,420
and of course there's going to be the online mode of course has to be you know

348
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:11,340
I never really got into the old-school fantasy star games I really wish I had

349
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,860
because I'm curious does fantasy star online actually have anything in common

350
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:20,580
with the old older fantasy stars there's some things but there's like the the

351
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:26,780
newman class or race there's the meseta is all the currency.

352
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,860
So, some little things.

353
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,820
It's got some things, yeah.

354
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:36,900
But you know they released the Sega Ages collection in the states, right?

355
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,900
Oh, really?

356
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,620
And it had the fantasy star.

357
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,660
You know the one that I brought over that was all the Japanese?

358
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,660
Yeah, I remember that.

359
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,500
It was the Fantasy Zone you brought over, right?

360
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:51,580
our fantasy zone is Space Harrier but we also have a fantasy star.

361
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:55,980
Oh very cool and they have this in the US now? Yeah. I was not aware. But it's like a collection now that

362
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,420
you can get for like 30 bucks.

363
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,700
Very cool. Instead of how I had to buy them which was all separate

364
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,180
for the sake of ages. So you can get like fantasy, you can get it all on one disc?

365
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:07,460
Pretty much. But you don't have to pick this up. Yeah. Dang. Very cool.

366
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,660
Well from one role-playing series to another we have

367
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:14,500
Final Fantasy VII Advent Children and

368
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,700
you know there was actually a little bit a question is this going to come out in

369
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,620
the US are we gonna have to import it what's going on well

370
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:24,280
it's definitely coming out in the US because they have launched the North

371
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:28,180
American website for Final Fantasy 7 Advent Children it's

372
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:32,180
na.square-enix.com

373
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,240
DVD slash FF7

374
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,460
AC so it's coming out you can actually download the US trailer on here

375
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:42,820
and it's definitely going to be coming out here's the interesting thing

376
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:46,180
not just out on DVD but also will be coming out

377
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:49,420
UMD. UMD, yep. Very interesting.

378
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:52,980
Also announced, I'm not sure if you're gonna cover this, but... Go for it.

379
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:56,900
Crysis Corps, which is another, it's gonna be a PSP

380
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,820
game that's gonna be tying in with the whole, I forget what they're calling it,

381
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:05,220
like the whole series of Final Fantasy VII stuff. Very cool. Is that the one with Vincent?

382
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,500
No, that's something else. There's so many of them now, it's like

383
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:13,340
For forever, people were saying, you know, oh there needs to be a sequel to Final Fantasy VII.

384
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,860
Oh, there needs to be. And now suddenly, it's like, we're getting too many.

385
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,340
I can't keep track of them all.

386
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,340
Alright, so hopefully soon we'll be seeing this. Of course,

387
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:26,020
not going to have a theatrical release. It's only going to be a DVD and UMD release.

388
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:30,100
But, what is interesting about this is that they actually announced in Japan,

389
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:35,300
Squeenix announced that they're going to be doing a special limited edition version.

390
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,620
of course that's the way to go you know you release the regular one in the

391
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:42,980
release a special edition for 20 bucks more course they haven't really said

392
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,420
what's going to be in this special edition it's just

393
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:49,580
bonus merchandise not available in the normal edition

394
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,380
so wow how I don't know specific yeah

395
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:57,060
hopefully we'll get more details on that in the next few weeks

396
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:01,180
and lastly tonight I thought we could close on a story

397
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:04,940
funny enough even though I said we're not going to be putting the rhythm music

398
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:08,220
games in our podcast intro anymore, because we talk about all sorts of other stuff. I

399
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:13,500
actually have a DDR story to talk about at the end here. Isn't that ironic?

400
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:21,100
A little too ironic. It's like rain. Okay. West Virginia, they've

401
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:27,020
got the Public Employees Insurance Agency. What they're doing, they've recruited 85 children

402
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:33,320
to take part in a study aimed at reducing costs associated with covering obesity claims

403
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:38,360
for its clients. What the study is doing is it's using DDR and it's trying to see

404
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:44,040
if there's a possibility to encourage weight loss via DDR at an early age.

405
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:49,400
Interesting. PEIA health promotions manager Nydia Henderson says

406
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:54,320
today's kids are tomorrow's members. Obesity claims last year cost us 77

407
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,880
million. We have to curtail these costs. The study is budgeted at $60,000 and hey

408
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:04,520
guess what if you're one of the 85 fat kids in this program you get a free copy

409
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:11,240
of a game system DDR and a DDR dance pad all complimentary for this but as a

410
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,640
trade-off if you're in the six-month program you will have to play the game

411
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,900
for a certain amount of time every day and you have to wear a meter and do all

412
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:23,400
these reports and stuff as well and you also have to sell your soul just you

413
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:28,520
know small text there to the Konami gods the insurance agency is also going to be

414
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:35,360
using $10,000 to try the game out at 20 public schools very interesting all this

415
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,480
DDR news about how you know it's just taken off out there and people use it

416
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,240
for all these weight loss things and yet still no new arcade mix still not

417
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,880
happening oh darn I think they're just forgetting something aren't they yeah

418
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,560
it's just like something something's forgotten it seems like that whole fan

419
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,880
base that helped DDR get big in the first place just suddenly you know

420
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:59,180
forgotten oh well we do get the whole mixes with the eye toy and all that yeah

421
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:03,000
but you know no new arcade things for you and your arcade makes it get me

422
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,840
totally back in the arcade I'll be there in a heartbeat especially if it was by

423
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,060
the folks that did ultra mix 2 which is by far the best DDR home release they've

424
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:14,020
done in my opinion but what do I know I'm just some dumb podcast guy on the

425
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:19,440
internet so from all us dumb internet celebrities from all us internet

426
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,340
celebrity podcasters to you guys that's gonna do it for another episode of

427
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,160
Orange Launch Radio to go.

428
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,720
DarkSakura, your closing thought for us tonight.

429
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,840
If you can't be an athlete, be an athletic supporter.

430
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,840
Loki.

431
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,960
I know there was something here.

432
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,800
I was trying to find the goddamn website.

433
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:46,480
Supposedly there's an ARG, Alternate Reality Gaming, a viral campaign for the XBox 2, 360,

434
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,120
whatever the hell they're calling it.

435
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,880
I thought it was called Colonies, because I actually looked at it at work.

436
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:56,920
I've heard about this, but basically it's turning into a giant penis-waving competition

437
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:03,320
because PlayStation 3 bumped up their showing of the console to beat Xbox and Nintendo at

438
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,320
E3.

439
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,120
It's just, and now Xbox signed up with a marketing campaign.

440
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,360
It's just, they're all trying to one-up each other.

441
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,360
We'll see what happens.

442
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,360
Yeah.

443
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,360
All right.

444
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,360
Anyways.

445
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,680
And my final thought is the Froger contains potassium benzoate.

446
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,680
Special.

447
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,680
All right.

448
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:24,680
Alright, that's going to do it. See you guys next time here on the Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

449
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,680
That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.
