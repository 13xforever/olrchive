00:00:00,445 --> 00:00:03,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of April 11th, 2005.

2
00:00:04,007 --> 00:00:14,512
[SPEAKER_01]: You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

3
00:00:14,793 --> 00:00:18,314
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

4
00:00:19,515 --> 00:00:20,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's right.

5
00:00:21,676 --> 00:00:23,957
[SPEAKER_02]: A little new sound there, a little bit of a new intro there.

6
00:00:24,918 --> 00:00:26,239
[SPEAKER_02]: The Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition.

7
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:28,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought we'd change things up a little bit around here.

8
00:00:29,212 --> 00:00:30,953
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

9
00:00:30,993 --> 00:00:35,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me as always, my awesome co-host here with me to talk about video games that don't suck.

10
00:00:36,014 --> 00:00:38,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Say hello to Jamie, also known as DarkSakura.

11
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:41,336
[SPEAKER_03]: There's plenty of games out there that suck.

12
00:00:41,756 --> 00:00:43,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Avoid them, please.

13
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:44,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, we beg you to.

14
00:00:44,957 --> 00:00:46,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't give them any more money.

15
00:00:47,378 --> 00:00:49,979
[SPEAKER_02]: And also with us, as always, say hello to Loki.

16
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:52,019
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm here again.

17
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:52,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you are.

18
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:53,580
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

19
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so you notice we kind of changed things a little bit there in the intro.

20
00:00:57,281 --> 00:00:57,601
[SPEAKER_02]: You know...

21
00:00:58,863 --> 00:01:14,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure as a lot of you have noticed, we haven't been talking a whole lot about rhythm and music games here on the podcast, so we kind of thought we'd refocus ourselves a little bit and tell you guys what we're really all about, and that's just kind of general video gaming, what gamers really want to know about.

22
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:21,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you're a DDR fan, don't get upset, because we're still going to talk about rhythm and music games plenty on this show.

23
00:01:21,492 --> 00:01:26,934
[SPEAKER_02]: When we find out that a lot of stuff is going on, new stuff in the world, we will bring it to you as soon as we find out.

24
00:01:26,974 --> 00:01:27,394
[SPEAKER_02]: But for now...

25
00:01:28,106 --> 00:01:28,627
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

26
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:48,517
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't.

27
00:01:48,697 --> 00:01:50,859
[SPEAKER_03]: I usually delete all the stupid games off of my cell phone.

28
00:01:51,199 --> 00:01:54,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen some of those games you can download on the cell phone, though?

29
00:01:54,161 --> 00:01:55,122
[SPEAKER_03]: I have Bejeweled on my phone.

30
00:01:55,643 --> 00:01:57,144
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we were talking about this a little bit last week.

31
00:01:57,164 --> 00:02:01,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember we were talking about it on the last podcast about the Chinese cell phone games that you can get?

32
00:02:01,027 --> 00:02:02,408
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just like, you can get Life Force.

33
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:04,490
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can get them in Japan.

34
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,921
[SPEAKER_03]: I want that Final Fantasy VII game.

35
00:02:07,341 --> 00:02:07,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Heck yeah.

36
00:02:07,742 --> 00:02:08,722
[SPEAKER_03]: The Turks game.

37
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:09,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Heck yeah.

38
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:16,688
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, the best thing we get, you know, I have Impossible Mission, which was, don't get me wrong, one of the greatest Commodore 64 games of all time.

39
00:02:17,068 --> 00:02:18,569
[SPEAKER_02]: But it sucks on the cell phone.

40
00:02:18,609 --> 00:02:19,529
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't even see the room.

41
00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:21,571
[SPEAKER_03]: They do have Gradius for the US phone, I found out.

42
00:02:21,631 --> 00:02:24,032
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not for anything, I think, that we have.

43
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:27,655
[SPEAKER_03]: And they, um... Shoot, there was, uh...

44
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,641
[SPEAKER_03]: A game that I was thinking when you said Impossible Mission.

45
00:02:31,661 --> 00:02:35,163
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking they should put Incredible Crisis on the cell phone.

46
00:02:35,483 --> 00:02:36,083
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be cool.

47
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,224
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it would have all the music on there, though.

48
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows what technology is.

49
00:02:40,505 --> 00:02:41,485
[SPEAKER_02]: So, any other games?

50
00:02:41,665 --> 00:02:41,946
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it?

51
00:02:41,986 --> 00:02:42,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Just cell phones?

52
00:02:43,006 --> 00:02:43,586
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really it.

53
00:02:43,986 --> 00:02:44,227
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

54
00:02:44,507 --> 00:02:44,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair enough.

55
00:02:44,887 --> 00:02:45,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what have you been up to?

56
00:02:46,027 --> 00:02:47,428
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been playing my PSP.

57
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:49,329
[SPEAKER_00]: What did I do?

58
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:49,709
[SPEAKER_00]: I was...

59
00:02:50,285 --> 00:03:01,249
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly playing Wipeout Pure only because my boss was borrowing the Twisted Metal head-on because he doesn't have any games for his, so I felt bad for him, so I loaned him that for a few days.

60
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:04,130
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been playing Wipeout Pure, and it's pretty fun.

61
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,771
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I hated Wipeout, and I don't know.

62
00:03:09,852 --> 00:03:12,073
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice right now while I have one game.

63
00:03:12,113 --> 00:03:16,314
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting more games coming in on Monday, so I'll have Luminous and Ridge Racer finally.

64
00:03:17,556 --> 00:03:24,242
[SPEAKER_00]: and then 512 megabyte memory sticks so I can put all my pirated episodes of Robot Chicken on there.

65
00:03:24,823 --> 00:03:25,603
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my favorite.

66
00:03:27,064 --> 00:03:34,391
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the other game I got was Zookeeper for the DS and I can see why I didn't get it before because it's kind of annoying.

67
00:03:34,611 --> 00:03:38,954
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I actually had to turn the background music off on it because it was that annoying.

68
00:03:38,974 --> 00:03:40,716
[SPEAKER_00]: It just repeated like every five seconds.

69
00:03:40,796 --> 00:03:41,837
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just awful.

70
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:49,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I've been checking out Zookeepers, too, since you picked it up, which basically, Zookeeper is just bejeweled on the DS.

71
00:03:49,867 --> 00:03:50,748
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's pretty.

72
00:03:51,008 --> 00:03:54,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, one minor change, the animal theme, and that's about it.

73
00:03:54,749 --> 00:03:55,609
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's basically bejeweled.

74
00:03:55,949 --> 00:04:03,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't it feel like one of those games that was really rushed to come out just because there are no other games out on the DS, so they know people would buy it?

75
00:04:04,272 --> 00:04:04,972
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, exactly.

76
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,432
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it is.

77
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,153
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's, like, no depth to it.

78
00:04:07,173 --> 00:04:10,734
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, ooh, it's a game I can pick up, play for a little bit, and I'm done.

79
00:04:11,557 --> 00:04:12,337
[SPEAKER_00]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

80
00:04:32,793 --> 00:04:34,315
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

81
00:04:54,397 --> 00:04:56,999
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I played it for about five minutes, and I was like, I've played this game before.

82
00:04:57,359 --> 00:04:59,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Bejeweled 2 is cooler than Zookeeper.

83
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:01,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't they put Bejeweled 2 on the DS?

84
00:05:01,142 --> 00:05:03,244
[SPEAKER_02]: At least you got, like, the super jewels and things like that.

85
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:09,129
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's got, like, a better theme, whereas Zookeeper gets... You know, the bleeps and bloops.

86
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:10,230
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like Atari 2600.

87
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,070
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hella annoying.

88
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:17,235
[SPEAKER_02]: The other game I got to check out this week, thanks to Loki, actually, managed to snag me a copy of Doom 3 on the Xbox.

89
00:05:17,856 --> 00:05:21,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, you know, I have to admit, I wasn't really interested in Doom 3 at all.

90
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:21,939
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

91
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,543
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's hard because I really liked Doom and Doom 2 when they were out years ago.

92
00:05:27,883 --> 00:05:31,264
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember how they were like the first, like, first-person games?

93
00:05:31,284 --> 00:05:34,546
[SPEAKER_02]: They were kind of like this sequel to Wolfenstein in a way.

94
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,768
[SPEAKER_02]: In a way, not really, but they were kind of like the next evolution of Wolfenstein.

95
00:05:37,828 --> 00:05:39,589
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Wolfenstein with ramps.

96
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:41,089
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not really ramps, actually.

97
00:05:41,109 --> 00:05:41,990
[SPEAKER_02]: And then multiplayer.

98
00:05:42,657 --> 00:05:43,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Which was really cool.

99
00:05:43,998 --> 00:05:48,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you remember, if you ever created your own maps in Wolfenstein, it's very 2D.

100
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:52,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Wolfenstein is really, it's like you take a 2D level and you put yourself in it.

101
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:53,545
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember doing that.

102
00:05:53,966 --> 00:05:55,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Doom was very 3D.

103
00:05:55,587 --> 00:05:57,548
[SPEAKER_03]: And it had the Wolfenstein level.

104
00:05:58,529 --> 00:05:58,889
[SPEAKER_02]: It did.

105
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:00,931
[SPEAKER_03]: You had to do the level skip code, but you could get there.

106
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:05,014
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it was level 40-something.

107
00:06:05,174 --> 00:06:05,634
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember.

108
00:06:05,654 --> 00:06:08,857
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of the levels that Wolfenstein was actually in Doom.

109
00:06:08,897 --> 00:06:09,337
[SPEAKER_02]: It was cool.

110
00:06:09,457 --> 00:06:09,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

111
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,100
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

112
00:06:27,782 --> 00:06:29,684
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually pleasantly surprised with Doom 3.

113
00:06:30,505 --> 00:06:33,027
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quite more to it than I thought.

114
00:06:33,147 --> 00:06:35,809
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like the other Dooms where you just jump in, start shooting.

115
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Even Halo is a lot like that.

116
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:42,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, Halo has its big cinematic opening, but it's kind of really just jump in, start shooting.

117
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:50,686
[SPEAKER_03]: But Halo 2, anyway, has where you can take the vehicles and completely abandon the game and fly around and go places you're not supposed to go.

118
00:06:50,806 --> 00:06:53,467
[SPEAKER_02]: There's plenty of differences between Halo 2 and Doom 3.

119
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:59,789
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to try and compare the two, but I'm just kind of, you know, I think a lot of times because they're first-person shooters, we kind of inadvertently compare them.

120
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:00,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Doom 3 Doom 2 Doom 3

121
00:07:25,214 --> 00:07:26,054
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really scary.

122
00:07:26,074 --> 00:07:30,356
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like bodies hanging from ceilings and zombies that jump up from the floor and stuff.

123
00:07:30,396 --> 00:07:31,416
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty freaky.

124
00:07:31,736 --> 00:07:32,696
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to see this.

125
00:07:32,776 --> 00:07:33,356
[SPEAKER_03]: I really do.

126
00:07:33,376 --> 00:07:34,317
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to show it to you.

127
00:07:34,337 --> 00:07:34,657
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty cool.

128
00:07:34,677 --> 00:07:35,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't it on PC as well?

129
00:07:36,077 --> 00:07:36,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

130
00:07:36,197 --> 00:07:40,338
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually started on PC, but Xbox has... I think I have it somewhere hanging around my house.

131
00:07:40,538 --> 00:07:43,599
[SPEAKER_02]: The cool thing about Doom 3 on Xbox is it has the Xbox Live stuff in it.

132
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:46,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I don't know anybody else with the game, so I can't play anybody yet.

133
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,901
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and they'll see the other thing is that it runs on your...

134
00:07:49,361 --> 00:07:50,061
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

135
00:08:10,467 --> 00:08:40,113
[SPEAKER_02]: but like in this one you can actually walk up to it and then zoom in and it seamlessly is zooming in and you actually can see like a number pad that you have to punch in an access code to get through the door it's crazy pretty insane yeah it's a high level of detail I like it anyway so that's pretty much my gaming well that and there's like these panels that you walk around that like have video playing it's like an actual like video talking about the whole facility welcome to Mars and don't get killed welcome to Recall

136
00:08:41,417 --> 00:08:43,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's start off with some gaming news tonight.

137
00:08:43,378 --> 00:08:46,881
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll actually talk about another game that's on its way towards Xbox.

138
00:08:47,521 --> 00:08:52,124
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an update for an old classic comic strip, and this was a game of one time as well.

139
00:08:52,144 --> 00:08:52,724
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember this one.

140
00:08:52,945 --> 00:08:54,365
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember Spy vs. Spy?

141
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, I have Spy vs. Spy comics in my bathroom.

142
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, Mad Magazine, right?

143
00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:01,530
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it spun off.

144
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,372
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was an old school Commodore 64 game too.

145
00:09:04,392 --> 00:09:05,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it came out on the NES.

146
00:09:05,252 --> 00:09:06,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was on the NES as well.

147
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:08,334
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember there were like three versions on the Commodore.

148
00:09:08,354 --> 00:09:09,035
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an awesome game.

149
00:09:09,577 --> 00:09:10,257
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

150
00:09:28,664 --> 00:09:30,265
[SPEAKER_02]: You go across the games, 12 levels.

151
00:09:30,626 --> 00:09:32,627
[SPEAKER_02]: There's weapons, booby traps, and gadgets.

152
00:09:32,687 --> 00:09:35,289
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of sounds very similar to the other one.

153
00:09:35,689 --> 00:09:39,752
[SPEAKER_02]: The other cool thing about Spy vs. Spy, though, and I always like it when game companies do this, it's a $19.99 title.

154
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:42,655
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're starting this off as a budget title.

155
00:09:42,675 --> 00:09:46,577
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a reason why it's $19.99, because you get what you pay for, people.

156
00:09:46,898 --> 00:09:49,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, we paid $19.99 for Katamari Damacy.

157
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,901
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.

158
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:51,661
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's right.

159
00:09:51,761 --> 00:09:52,402
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what?

160
00:09:52,422 --> 00:09:54,763
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of those exceptions to the rule, okay?

161
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,826
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought Technic Beat, which came out at the same time, was very cool as well.

162
00:09:58,286 --> 00:09:59,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a 29 game.

163
00:09:59,987 --> 00:10:00,467
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, Rob.

164
00:10:00,487 --> 00:10:02,188
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Spy vs. Spy, okay?

165
00:10:02,388 --> 00:10:04,229
[SPEAKER_00]: Spy vs. Spy for the NES sucked.

166
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:10,212
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a fond place in my heart for the Spy vs. Spy Commodore games, because I was a kid when those were out, and it was great.

167
00:10:10,472 --> 00:10:11,413
[SPEAKER_00]: Horrible reviews.

168
00:10:11,613 --> 00:10:13,814
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even think anyone actually wanted to review this game.

169
00:10:13,874 --> 00:10:14,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll tell you, though.

170
00:10:14,734 --> 00:10:18,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's the thing that might make you go kind of, uh, maybe this is a crappy game.

171
00:10:18,276 --> 00:10:18,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't know yet, though.

172
00:10:19,217 --> 00:10:21,138
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 2 version got canceled.

173
00:10:21,918 --> 00:10:22,699
[SPEAKER_02]: They decided not to do it.

174
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:25,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Seems very interesting, hmm?

175
00:10:26,736 --> 00:10:29,638
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I would have to get Spy vs. Spy just because.

176
00:10:29,658 --> 00:10:31,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.

177
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:34,880
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be the just because factor, and I'd get it for 30% off anyway.

178
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone should send me a free one.

179
00:10:36,401 --> 00:10:37,001
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that idea.

180
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:38,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just get it for cheap.

181
00:10:38,742 --> 00:10:44,505
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a free copy of Spy vs. Spy you want to send us, togo, T-O-G-O, at orangelaunchradio.com.

182
00:10:44,525 --> 00:10:46,206
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, you could really write us about anything.

183
00:10:46,506 --> 00:10:48,087
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll read whatever emails you've got to send us.

184
00:10:51,027 --> 00:10:52,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk old school consoles for a minute.

185
00:10:52,788 --> 00:10:54,408
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is really cool, this story.

186
00:10:54,428 --> 00:10:56,509
[SPEAKER_02]: It talks about the Atari 2600.

187
00:10:57,489 --> 00:11:00,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you believe there's still new Atari 2600 news after all these years?

188
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:05,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, people are still making ROMs for the 2600.

189
00:11:05,411 --> 00:11:06,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you got it.

190
00:11:06,191 --> 00:11:06,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it is.

191
00:11:06,852 --> 00:11:07,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Retro Redo.

192
00:11:07,852 --> 00:11:11,393
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a 24-hour video game programming contest held...

193
00:11:11,809 --> 00:11:12,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Ninja Garden Ninja Garden

194
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:30,850
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

195
00:11:47,443 --> 00:11:48,323
[SPEAKER_02]: But, okay, whatever.

196
00:11:49,444 --> 00:11:53,746
[SPEAKER_02]: The prize is that this game, Ninja Garden, is going to be included in the next version of that.

197
00:11:54,026 --> 00:11:54,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, pretty cool.

198
00:11:54,546 --> 00:11:56,707
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of the, you know, new secret game.

199
00:11:56,988 --> 00:12:03,651
[SPEAKER_00]: Truth be told, people, you could actually probably pull a chip out of one of those and actually flash any ROMs you want on there, but... Whatever.

200
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that we encourage you to break your warranty and do that.

201
00:12:06,472 --> 00:12:08,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, come on, I'm working on a $20 item.

202
00:12:08,633 --> 00:12:09,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Woo!

203
00:12:09,173 --> 00:12:10,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta replace that one.

204
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:12,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they releasing that thing with the whip handling?

205
00:12:13,408 --> 00:12:14,429
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not.

206
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:18,231
[SPEAKER_02]: You know it's not the old wood panel style we had way back in the day.

207
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:19,152
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the kind that I have.

208
00:12:19,192 --> 00:12:20,273
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the cheap plastic.

209
00:12:20,313 --> 00:12:21,574
[SPEAKER_03]: The third release one, right?

210
00:12:21,614 --> 00:12:21,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

211
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:24,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't even know if it exactly looks like one of those.

212
00:12:27,758 --> 00:12:30,680
[SPEAKER_02]: From old system to very new system, PSP.

213
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,302
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of folks were saying, oh, it sold great.

214
00:12:33,322 --> 00:12:35,163
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the best system ever in sales.

215
00:12:35,223 --> 00:12:37,405
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people were saying, disappointing.

216
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:45,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the first week sales figures are out now, and the PSP sold 600,000 units in its first week.

217
00:12:46,838 --> 00:12:48,880
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what that equates to?

218
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,722
[SPEAKER_02]: About $150 million.

219
00:12:51,362 --> 00:12:53,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Good, then Sony will be able to pay that $90 million off.

220
00:12:54,606 --> 00:12:56,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, in that lawsuit we were talking about.

221
00:12:57,549 --> 00:12:58,790
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see, we'll see about that one.

222
00:12:59,711 --> 00:12:59,971
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

223
00:13:01,393 --> 00:13:05,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, in other handheld gaming news, Nintendo's got this DS.

224
00:13:06,015 --> 00:13:07,936
[SPEAKER_02]: You might have heard of this new game on the way for the DS.

225
00:13:07,976 --> 00:13:09,177
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Electroplankton.

226
00:13:09,717 --> 00:13:10,958
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you've heard about this at all.

227
00:13:11,698 --> 00:13:12,239
[SPEAKER_00]: They have like...

228
00:13:13,632 --> 00:13:15,233
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought there was a website for this or something.

229
00:13:33,368 --> 00:13:35,950
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're doing an interesting promotion here, Nintendo is.

230
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:43,757
[SPEAKER_02]: What they're going to be doing, they're actually going to have like an aquarium exhibition hall at this Tokyo show from April 8th to 14th.

231
00:13:44,177 --> 00:13:46,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Entrance is free and you get to see the whole thing.

232
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:54,947
[SPEAKER_02]: And the cool thing about this is Nintendo's going to be giving away only 10 limited edition electroplankton DS units.

233
00:13:55,948 --> 00:13:56,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Should be interesting.

234
00:13:57,734 --> 00:14:03,436
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the looks of it, it pretty much looks exactly like a normal DS, except there's this little sticker on it.

235
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:05,377
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be an engraving, though.

236
00:14:05,617 --> 00:14:06,858
[SPEAKER_00]: An engraving, whatever.

237
00:14:07,098 --> 00:14:08,519
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the lighting.

238
00:14:08,619 --> 00:14:12,480
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyways, it's just... It's actually what that is.

239
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,401
[SPEAKER_02]: It is an engraving.

240
00:14:13,461 --> 00:14:15,582
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the original electroplankton artwork.

241
00:14:16,162 --> 00:14:16,282
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

242
00:14:16,946 --> 00:14:20,468
[SPEAKER_02]: So whoever's going to get that, they're going to put it on friggin' eBay, and it's going to sell for a lot.

243
00:14:20,488 --> 00:14:20,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

244
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:21,469
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

245
00:14:21,849 --> 00:14:22,209
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

246
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:29,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of Nintendo, you know how we have in San Francisco, now we, you know, we based our show out of Sacramento, so San Francisco's just a drive up the road.

247
00:14:29,934 --> 00:14:33,897
[SPEAKER_02]: And in San Francisco, they have the official Sony PlayStation Store at the Sony Metron.

248
00:14:33,917 --> 00:14:35,158
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been there before, right, DarkSakura?

249
00:14:35,338 --> 00:14:35,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

250
00:14:35,938 --> 00:14:36,519
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun, huh?

251
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:37,419
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big geek place.

252
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:38,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

253
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,561
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole Metron is just geek central.

254
00:14:39,761 --> 00:14:39,961
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.

255
00:14:39,981 --> 00:14:40,821
[SPEAKER_03]: And with overpriced games.

256
00:14:41,142 --> 00:14:41,922
[SPEAKER_02]: And overpriced food.

257
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:44,024
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, it's fun, you know.

258
00:14:44,364 --> 00:14:44,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Well...

259
00:14:45,262 --> 00:14:49,665
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're on the other coast, there's a gaming company that's going to be doing something similar for you guys.

260
00:14:49,825 --> 00:14:52,808
[SPEAKER_02]: In New York City, New York City!

261
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:53,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a rope!

262
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:58,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Rockefeller Center will soon be home to the Nintendo World Store.

263
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:04,396
[SPEAKER_02]: A two-story complex, Mario, Zelda, Nintendo, you think of it.

264
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:08,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the location will host the brand new Pokemon Center.

265
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Joy, joy, joy.

266
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:14,966
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we leave our kids there, put them in Pokeball?

267
00:15:15,346 --> 00:15:16,406
[SPEAKER_03]: People are going to do that anyway.

268
00:15:16,566 --> 00:15:17,426
[SPEAKER_00]: You know it's going to happen.

269
00:15:18,187 --> 00:15:19,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Go play, kid!

270
00:15:19,767 --> 00:15:27,269
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really surprised they're not doing it in Seattle since the Nintendo headquarters is just north of Tacoma.

271
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:28,970
[SPEAKER_02]: That is kind of surprising to me.

272
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:32,431
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it's fun to try stuff on the other coast, too.

273
00:15:32,471 --> 00:15:35,692
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we get spoiled here on the West Coast sometimes with all these technology things.

274
00:15:36,272 --> 00:15:37,352
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not complaining.

275
00:15:37,712 --> 00:15:38,952
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew up in Alabama.

276
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:40,093
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not complaining.

277
00:15:41,718 --> 00:15:42,398
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say, you know what?

278
00:15:42,418 --> 00:15:47,241
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also over, well, not exactly on the East Coast, but the West Coast by the, you know, Microsoft.

279
00:15:47,261 --> 00:15:49,143
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they've got to have their, you know.

280
00:15:49,203 --> 00:15:49,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

281
00:15:49,903 --> 00:15:50,543
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the thing.

282
00:15:50,603 --> 00:15:57,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, if Sony has chosen San Francisco and Nintendo has chosen New York, where's Microsoft going to go?

283
00:15:58,849 --> 00:15:59,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully Alaska.

284
00:15:59,849 --> 00:16:00,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Seattle.

285
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully Alaska.

286
00:16:02,311 --> 00:16:02,791
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm kidding.

287
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:03,531
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kidding.

288
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:05,553
[SPEAKER_03]: The South Pole.

289
00:16:05,913 --> 00:16:06,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably L.A.

290
00:16:06,874 --> 00:16:07,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

291
00:16:08,114 --> 00:16:08,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

292
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:09,195
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

293
00:16:10,556 --> 00:16:10,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Now,

294
00:16:11,092 --> 00:16:13,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, I know you're a big fan of Namco, the company, right?

295
00:16:14,194 --> 00:16:15,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you such a fan of Namco?

296
00:16:15,534 --> 00:16:16,195
[SPEAKER_03]: I worked for them.

297
00:16:16,755 --> 00:16:18,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so you still have a lot of company loyalty?

298
00:16:19,496 --> 00:16:21,898
[SPEAKER_03]: I had the coolest uniform shirt ever.

299
00:16:22,338 --> 00:16:24,519
[SPEAKER_03]: It was red and black and had Pac-Man on it.

300
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,681
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the coolest thing about Namco?

301
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything Tekken related.

302
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:30,602
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

303
00:16:31,342 --> 00:16:36,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what's actually coming out on the PlayStation 2 is Nam Collection.

304
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,510
[SPEAKER_02]: They've actually pushed this back, though.

305
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:42,232
[SPEAKER_02]: It was going to come out in Japan on June 2nd, but it actually got pushed back a little bit.

306
00:16:42,613 --> 00:16:43,753
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the NAMM collection?

307
00:16:43,813 --> 00:16:46,695
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be five classic PlayStation games.

308
00:16:46,996 --> 00:16:53,820
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be Ridge Racer, Ace Combat 2, Kelowna, Mr. Driller, and Tekken.

309
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

310
00:16:55,461 --> 00:16:56,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Klonoa.

311
00:16:56,542 --> 00:16:57,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, Klonoa.

312
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:59,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is like one of the most awesome platformers ever.

313
00:16:59,984 --> 00:17:00,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

314
00:17:01,134 --> 00:17:08,059
[SPEAKER_02]: The compilation is also going to have a gallery mode and movies with tips and tricks on how to get through the game.

315
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:13,323
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember on the old PlayStation they had the N-A-M-C-O, all that libraries.

316
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:17,046
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like they're doing that all over again, but now for the newer games.

317
00:17:17,086 --> 00:17:20,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Because PlayStation, believe it or not, is getting to be like 10 years old.

318
00:17:21,229 --> 00:17:22,030
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of sad.

319
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:27,354
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this sounds like a desperate attempt at money.

320
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, isn't everything?

321
00:17:29,601 --> 00:17:30,141
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, come on.

322
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:32,522
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to play Tekken, go buy Tekken 5.

323
00:17:32,742 --> 00:17:34,803
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, because you have no Tekken in there.

324
00:17:34,983 --> 00:17:35,364
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

325
00:17:35,644 --> 00:17:41,867
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just like, okay, it's like how Nintendo released those retro games that are available on the Advance.

326
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:44,228
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the games you can buy is Metroid.

327
00:17:45,074 --> 00:18:10,784
[SPEAKER_00]: But hello, spend ten more dollars and you could get Metroid Zero Mission Which has Metroid in it Yeah And is a great game outside of that Or all those other like classic games that you could actually download via Animal Crossing That too, a lot of games that you could just get on Animal Crossing It's just ridiculous, but hey folks that buy, you know, the Nintendo products They like to shell out money for the same thing over and over and over again, so why not?

328
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:14,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Retro holds a place in many people's hearts though, it really does

329
00:18:15,967 --> 00:18:40,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio to go to show we're not here just to talk about games all the time because you know if we talked about games all the time we'd have no time to go clubbing so what we're here to do as well as we're here to better your life and who better to give you some advice on how to better your life than our very own Dark Sakura with her advice column and Jamie what are you going to tell the kids about tonight

330
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:46,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this one I think is very, very useful.

331
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,672
[SPEAKER_03]: One that everybody needs to know.

332
00:18:49,592 --> 00:18:50,072
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's this?

333
00:18:50,472 --> 00:18:51,913
[SPEAKER_03]: How to treat a bullet or knife wound.

334
00:18:52,233 --> 00:18:52,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, okay.

335
00:18:53,374 --> 00:19:01,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, it always happens when you get in one of those heated soul caliber battles where someone ends up getting cut in the end.

336
00:19:02,477 --> 00:19:03,518
[SPEAKER_02]: So, this is good to know.

337
00:19:04,638 --> 00:19:06,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you ready?

338
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:06,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

339
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one, do not immediately pull out any impaled objects.

340
00:19:11,724 --> 00:19:12,486
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

341
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:23,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, unfortunately.

342
00:19:47,216 --> 00:19:55,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Control the bleeding by using a combination of direct pressure, limb elevation, pressure points, and tourniquets in that order.

343
00:19:55,644 --> 00:19:56,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Immobilize the injured area.

344
00:19:57,485 --> 00:20:05,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Using splints and dressings to immobilize an injured area helps protect from further injury and maintain clots that have begun to form.

345
00:20:05,212 --> 00:20:08,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Dress the wound and strive to prevent infection.

346
00:20:09,696 --> 00:20:11,598
[SPEAKER_03]: That means dump a bottle of vodka on their legs.

347
00:20:12,757 --> 00:20:15,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, five, get medical attention as soon as possible.

348
00:20:15,638 --> 00:20:17,358
[SPEAKER_03]: But of course, you know what I always say in the end.

349
00:20:17,498 --> 00:20:17,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes?

350
00:20:17,979 --> 00:20:19,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get shot, stupid!

351
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:20,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Duck!

352
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much for that lovely piece of advice.

353
00:20:25,081 --> 00:20:28,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's, people, if bullets are flying, freaking hide.

354
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:33,023
[SPEAKER_02]: If somebody runs a gun, or if somebody pulls a gun, you run!

355
00:20:33,323 --> 00:20:33,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a little bitch.

356
00:20:34,143 --> 00:20:34,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

357
00:20:34,923 --> 00:20:36,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, you could usually end up getting shot in the back.

358
00:20:38,384 --> 00:20:39,245
[SPEAKER_02]: You won't care!

359
00:20:39,265 --> 00:20:40,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Be careful.

360
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:47,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of getting shot, you remember how the Godfather, the movie, had a game come out pretty recently?

361
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,721
[SPEAKER_02]: They made like the Godfather game.

362
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:55,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, did you know that the Godfather game did not have everybody's blessing in coming out?

363
00:20:55,304 --> 00:20:57,866
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, some people are quite irritated about this game coming out.

364
00:20:58,186 --> 00:21:00,507
[SPEAKER_02]: You know who one of the folks is that's pretty irritated about it?

365
00:21:01,548 --> 00:21:06,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Francis Ford Coppola, who made the damn movies, is not happy about this.

366
00:21:07,515 --> 00:21:17,618
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, he's actually expressed his displeasure with Paramount Pictures because they ended up selling the rights out.

367
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:23,280
[SPEAKER_02]: He's actually going to talk about this on an AMC show called Sunday Morning Shootout.

368
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,000
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what he says.

369
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,500
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew nothing about it.

370
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,841
[SPEAKER_02]: They never asked me if I thought it was a good idea.

371
00:21:28,181 --> 00:21:29,141
[SPEAKER_02]: They use the characters.

372
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:29,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone knows.

373
00:21:30,262 --> 00:21:32,262
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for the next hour, they shoot and kill each other.

374
00:21:32,362 --> 00:21:35,283
[SPEAKER_02]: I had absolutely nothing to do with this game, and I disapprove.

375
00:21:36,218 --> 00:21:38,980
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, that's why they didn't tell you about it, because it's going to suck.

376
00:21:39,461 --> 00:21:39,901
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

377
00:21:41,002 --> 00:21:42,403
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you'd actually approve that.

378
00:21:43,704 --> 00:21:44,364
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the whole point.

379
00:21:44,384 --> 00:21:46,266
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's never going to work out.

380
00:21:46,846 --> 00:21:47,767
[SPEAKER_00]: But, hey, that's all right.

381
00:21:47,847 --> 00:21:49,689
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have a nice Grand Theft Auto clone.

382
00:21:52,271 --> 00:21:53,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Phantasy Star.

383
00:21:54,032 --> 00:21:55,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of you guys have played this out there.

384
00:21:55,493 --> 00:21:57,815
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you used to play this a while ago, DarkSakura.

385
00:21:58,075 --> 00:21:58,355
[SPEAKER_02]: A bit.

386
00:21:58,435 --> 00:21:59,456
[SPEAKER_02]: I've played it on and off.

387
00:21:59,496 --> 00:22:03,619
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like I can never keep going with Phantasy Star online enough to go past, like, level 10 or 11.

388
00:22:05,134 --> 00:22:05,934
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

389
00:22:35,467 --> 00:22:42,051
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully it will have nothing to do with Phantasy Star Online Volume 3, which was like the card game.

390
00:22:42,811 --> 00:22:43,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Which was the suck.

391
00:22:44,012 --> 00:22:46,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully it'll go back to the regular one.

392
00:22:46,353 --> 00:22:47,213
[SPEAKER_03]: We need Blue Burst.

393
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:56,018
[SPEAKER_02]: The single player campaign is expected to clock in at roughly 40 hours of play with three planets to explore and new enemies to fight.

394
00:22:56,398 --> 00:23:00,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Gamers no longer have to go around on foot because there's actually going to be vehicles in the game.

395
00:23:01,861 --> 00:23:03,622
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course there's going to be the online mode.

396
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:04,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

397
00:23:04,623 --> 00:23:04,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Has to be.

398
00:23:07,196 --> 00:23:10,237
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I never really got into the old school Phantasy Star games.

399
00:23:10,297 --> 00:23:11,257
[SPEAKER_02]: I really wish I had.

400
00:23:11,597 --> 00:23:16,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm curious, does Phantasy Star Online actually have anything in common with the older Phantasy Stars?

401
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:22,861
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some things, but there's like the Newman class, you know, or race.

402
00:23:22,941 --> 00:23:26,802
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the Meseta, there's all the, you know, currency.

403
00:23:26,942 --> 00:23:28,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so some little things.

404
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:30,023
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got some things, yeah.

405
00:23:30,603 --> 00:23:32,264
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know...

406
00:23:33,473 --> 00:23:36,914
[SPEAKER_03]: They released the Sega Ages Collection in the States, right?

407
00:23:37,294 --> 00:23:37,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?

408
00:23:37,994 --> 00:23:39,574
[SPEAKER_03]: And it had the Phantasy Star.

409
00:23:39,594 --> 00:23:41,655
[SPEAKER_03]: You know the one that I brought over that was all in Japanese?

410
00:23:41,675 --> 00:23:42,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I remember that.

411
00:23:42,195 --> 00:23:45,476
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the Fantasy Zone you brought over, right?

412
00:23:45,516 --> 00:23:51,437
[SPEAKER_03]: I brought over Fantasy Zone and Space Harrier, but we also have Phantasy Star.

413
00:23:51,957 --> 00:23:52,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, very cool.

414
00:23:52,517 --> 00:23:53,377
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have this in the U.S.

415
00:23:53,417 --> 00:23:53,557
[SPEAKER_02]: now.

416
00:23:53,777 --> 00:23:53,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

417
00:23:54,097 --> 00:23:54,597
[SPEAKER_02]: I was not aware.

418
00:23:54,697 --> 00:23:56,738
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's like a collection now that you can get for like $30.

419
00:23:56,778 --> 00:23:56,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

420
00:23:57,731 --> 00:23:58,931
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

421
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:22,649
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely coming out in the U.S.

422
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:27,898
[SPEAKER_02]: because they have launched the North American website for Final Fantasy VII Advent Children.

423
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:31,143
[SPEAKER_02]: It's na.square-enix.com DVD FF7AC

424
00:24:36,471 --> 00:24:41,892
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's coming out, and you can actually download the US trailer on here, and it's definitely going to be coming out.

425
00:24:41,932 --> 00:24:42,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the interesting thing.

426
00:24:43,072 --> 00:24:47,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just out on DVD, but also will be coming out UMD.

427
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:47,953
[SPEAKER_00]: UMD, yep.

428
00:24:48,693 --> 00:24:49,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.

429
00:24:49,593 --> 00:25:03,496
[SPEAKER_00]: Also announced, I'm not sure if you're going to cover this, but Crisis Core, which is another, it's going to be a PSP game that's going to be tying in with the whole, I forget what they're calling it, like the whole series of Final Fantasy VII stuff.

430
00:25:03,976 --> 00:25:04,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

431
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:05,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the one with Vincent?

432
00:25:05,899 --> 00:25:07,240
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's something else.

433
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,221
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many of them now.

434
00:25:08,241 --> 00:25:13,286
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like for forever, people were saying, you know, oh, there needs to be a sequel to Final Fantasy VII.

435
00:25:13,326 --> 00:25:13,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there needs to be.

436
00:25:13,866 --> 00:25:15,587
[SPEAKER_02]: And now suddenly it's like we're getting too many.

437
00:25:16,028 --> 00:25:17,129
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't keep track of them all.

438
00:25:19,815 --> 00:25:21,777
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so hopefully soon we'll be seeing this.

439
00:25:21,817 --> 00:25:23,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, not going to have a theatrical release.

440
00:25:24,058 --> 00:25:26,000
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only going to be a DVD and UMD release.

441
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:35,167
[SPEAKER_02]: But what is interesting about this is that they actually announced in Japan, Squeenix announced that they're going to be doing a special limited edition version.

442
00:25:35,587 --> 00:25:36,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, that's the way to go.

443
00:25:36,928 --> 00:25:40,851
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you release the regular one and they release a special edition for $20 more.

444
00:25:40,871 --> 00:25:44,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, they haven't really said what's going to be in this special edition.

445
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:45,235
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just...

446
00:25:45,856 --> 00:25:49,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Bonus merchandise not available in the normal edition.

447
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, how specific.

448
00:25:54,123 --> 00:25:56,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully we'll get more details on that in the next few weeks.

449
00:25:58,706 --> 00:26:01,028
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly tonight, I thought we could close on a story.

450
00:26:01,589 --> 00:26:10,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Funny enough, even though I said we're not going to be putting the rhythm of music games in our podcast intro anymore because we talk about all sorts of other stuff, I actually have a DDR story to talk about at the end here.

451
00:26:10,976 --> 00:26:11,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that ironic?

452
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:14,479
[SPEAKER_03]: A little too ironic.

453
00:26:15,342 --> 00:26:16,202
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like rain.

454
00:26:16,382 --> 00:26:17,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

455
00:26:18,083 --> 00:26:19,183
[SPEAKER_02]: West Virginia.

456
00:26:20,064 --> 00:26:23,885
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got the Public Employees Insurance Agency.

457
00:26:24,545 --> 00:26:34,209
[SPEAKER_02]: What they're doing, they've recruited 85 children to take part in a study aimed at reducing costs associated with covering obesity claims for its clients.

458
00:26:35,249 --> 00:26:42,872
[SPEAKER_02]: What the study is doing is it's using DDR and it's trying to see if there's a possibility to encourage weight loss via DDR at an early age.

459
00:26:44,607 --> 00:26:45,508
[SPEAKER_02]: P.E.I.A.

460
00:26:46,749 --> 00:26:51,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Health Promotions Manager Nydia Henderson says, Today's kids are tomorrow's members.

461
00:26:51,792 --> 00:26:54,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Obesity claims last year cost us $77 million.

462
00:26:55,174 --> 00:26:56,715
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to curtail these costs.

463
00:26:57,255 --> 00:26:58,336
[SPEAKER_02]: The study is budgeted at $60,000.

464
00:26:58,977 --> 00:27:00,257
[SPEAKER_02]: And hey, guess what?

465
00:27:00,277 --> 00:27:05,641
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're one of the 85 fat kids in this program, you get a free copy of a game system.

466
00:27:06,283 --> 00:27:08,945
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR, and a DDR dance pad.

467
00:27:09,105 --> 00:27:10,166
[SPEAKER_02]: All complimentary for this.

468
00:27:10,887 --> 00:27:20,394
[SPEAKER_02]: But, as a trade-off, if you're in the six-month program, you will have to play the game for a certain amount of time every day, and you have to wear a meter and do all these reports and stuff as well.

469
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:21,715
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also have to sell your soul.

470
00:27:22,956 --> 00:27:24,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, you know, small text there.

471
00:27:24,958 --> 00:27:25,859
[SPEAKER_02]: To the Konami gods.

472
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,264
[SPEAKER_02]: The insurance agency is also going to be using $10,000 to try the game out at 20 public schools.

473
00:27:33,164 --> 00:27:33,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.

474
00:27:35,074 --> 00:27:42,476
[SPEAKER_02]: All this DDR news about how, you know, it's just taken off out there and people are using it for all these weight loss things and yet, still no new arcade mix.

475
00:27:42,936 --> 00:27:43,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Still not happening.

476
00:27:44,217 --> 00:27:44,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, darn.

477
00:27:44,817 --> 00:27:46,678
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're just forgetting something, aren't they?

478
00:27:46,778 --> 00:27:48,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's just like something's forgotten.

479
00:27:48,758 --> 00:27:54,580
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like that whole fan base that helped DDR get big in the first place just suddenly, you know, forgotten.

480
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, we do get the home mixes with the eye toy and all that.

481
00:27:57,921 --> 00:27:58,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that, yeah.

482
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:00,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but, you know, no new arcade things for you.

483
00:28:01,851 --> 00:28:04,214
[SPEAKER_03]: And the arcade mix would get me totally back in the arcade.

484
00:28:04,254 --> 00:28:10,219
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be there in a heartbeat, especially if it was by the folks that did Ultramix 2, which is by far the best DDR home release they've done, in my opinion.

485
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,520
[SPEAKER_02]: But what do I know?

486
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,363
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just some dumb podcast guy on the internet.

487
00:28:15,384 --> 00:28:17,566
[SPEAKER_02]: We're internet celebrities!

488
00:28:18,307 --> 00:28:24,452
[SPEAKER_02]: From all us internet celebrity podcasters to you guys, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio To Go.

489
00:28:25,033 --> 00:28:27,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Sakura, your closing thought for us tonight.

490
00:28:28,675 --> 00:28:31,438
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can't be an athlete, be an athletic supporter.

491
00:28:43,373 --> 00:28:44,933
[SPEAKER_00]: And now Xbox signed up with a marketing campaign.

492
00:28:44,953 --> 00:28:47,454
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, you know, they're all trying to one-up each other.

493
00:28:47,474 --> 00:28:48,214
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what happens.

494
00:28:48,234 --> 00:28:48,594
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

495
00:29:10,598 --> 00:29:12,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyways.

496
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:18,324
[SPEAKER_02]: And my final thought is the Froger contains potassium benzoate.

497
00:29:20,065 --> 00:29:20,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Special.

498
00:29:20,846 --> 00:29:21,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's going to do it.

499
00:29:21,967 --> 00:29:24,569
[SPEAKER_02]: See you guys next time here on the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition.

500
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:29,212
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition.

501
00:29:29,513 --> 00:29:36,498
[SPEAKER_01]: This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com See you next update.
