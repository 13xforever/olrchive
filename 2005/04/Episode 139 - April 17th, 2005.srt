[SPEAKER_07]: How you doing, sir?

55
00:05:23,549 --> 00:05:24,590
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing just fine, yourself?

56
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:25,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Good!

57
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:35,238
[SPEAKER_07]: I am a little sad, though, because as you have heard, the rumors are true, tonight is the last episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

58
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:37,340
[SPEAKER_07]: From this studio.

59
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,005
[SPEAKER_36]: So... I was about to say, all the more reason I'm here, but alright.

60
00:05:43,605 --> 00:05:46,988
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, we are starting over.

61
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:49,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually...

62
00:05:50,359 --> 00:06:02,085
[SPEAKER_07]: This is, yeah, actually that's kind of the theme of tonight, is we are starting over, because we're saying goodbye to this studio that served us well for the past two years of the show, and we're going to be moving into a new studio in two weeks.

63
00:06:02,345 --> 00:06:04,887
[SPEAKER_07]: We're actually not going to be here next week, we'll talk about that a little more in a little bit.

64
00:06:06,768 --> 00:06:11,430
[SPEAKER_07]: But this place right now is, I would say it's empty, but it's really not.

65
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,252
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like the remnants of a tsunami in this place, to be honest.

66
00:06:15,472 --> 00:06:16,673
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how else to explain it.

67
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:17,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki...

68
00:06:19,102 --> 00:06:21,864
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like any house that you would see on Cops.

69
00:06:23,585 --> 00:06:24,725
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good way of putting it.

70
00:06:25,306 --> 00:06:26,366
[SPEAKER_15]: With wires everywhere.

71
00:06:26,947 --> 00:06:29,168
[SPEAKER_15]: And a hidden stash of heroin in Loki's room.

72
00:06:31,429 --> 00:06:34,751
[SPEAKER_03]: My room literally has a pile of crap on top of the bed.

73
00:06:34,831 --> 00:06:40,795
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like this giant pile of clothes and records and God, who knows what.

74
00:06:41,095 --> 00:06:47,399
[SPEAKER_15]: I instantly was, I knew better because I've actually known someone who has a pile of real crap on his bed from his cat.

75
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:50,269
[SPEAKER_15]: It was very gross.

76
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,470
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a friend of mine's ex-boyfriend.

77
00:06:54,011 --> 00:07:01,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, so our webcam tonight, unfortunately, because of the move going on, we're actually missing... The arcade cabinet is no longer here in the studio.

78
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:03,955
[SPEAKER_07]: The couch is no longer here in the studio.

79
00:07:04,235 --> 00:07:06,096
[SPEAKER_15]: We tried to hook up the Shamu cam.

80
00:07:06,556 --> 00:07:07,657
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the coffee table.

81
00:07:07,857 --> 00:07:11,238
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're... There's no computer to run a webcam.

82
00:07:11,378 --> 00:07:13,559
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the PlayStation 2 is not even here anymore.

83
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,681
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the computer is in the...

84
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,411
[SPEAKER_03]: The kitchen, for some reason.

85
00:07:22,272 --> 00:07:23,933
[SPEAKER_07]: It's toasting something, apparently.

86
00:07:24,013 --> 00:07:24,493
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

87
00:07:24,994 --> 00:07:27,315
[SPEAKER_03]: My other computer is over here next to the chair.

88
00:07:27,495 --> 00:07:29,376
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an Amiga, suddenly, and it wants toast.

89
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:32,437
[SPEAKER_07]: The metal dance pads are in the bathroom.

90
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,040
[SPEAKER_07]: I went in to take a shower today, and I'm like, what the fuck?

91
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,201
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a dance pad on the floor.

92
00:07:41,882 --> 00:07:42,423
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a mess.

93
00:07:42,723 --> 00:07:46,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, so we would love to show this to you guys on webcam, but we have no way to do it.

94
00:07:46,585 --> 00:07:46,965
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, we do.

95
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,891
[SPEAKER_15]: I have the transfer cable and my telephone.

96
00:07:53,011 --> 00:07:58,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so maybe we'll figure something out, but for now... I really am too lazy to do that.

97
00:07:58,153 --> 00:08:01,234
[SPEAKER_07]: For now, we're patching in the Sacramento webcam.

98
00:08:01,834 --> 00:08:03,494
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can see the town where we live.

99
00:08:05,355 --> 00:08:10,256
[SPEAKER_15]: All I need is an STP program or someone to put it up somewhere for me.

100
00:08:10,636 --> 00:08:12,897
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'll take pictures with my cell phone.

101
00:08:13,864 --> 00:08:14,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Watch Desperate House what?

102
00:08:15,025 --> 00:08:17,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually don't, because that's on right now.

103
00:08:17,687 --> 00:08:18,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Watch... What other shows are on ABC?

104
00:08:41,733 --> 00:08:47,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Watch Lost Wednesday night at some time on News 10.

105
00:08:47,718 --> 00:08:50,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless you're not in Sacramento, then I guess you're screwed.

106
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:52,302
[SPEAKER_15]: Followed by Temple of Butt.

107
00:08:52,643 --> 00:08:53,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

108
00:08:54,644 --> 00:08:57,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, watch The Bachelorette because nobody else is.

109
00:08:58,628 --> 00:08:59,889
[SPEAKER_15]: Speaking of Temple of Butt...

110
00:09:01,605 --> 00:09:02,767
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be back after this.

111
00:09:37,674 --> 00:09:40,196
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for watching

[SPEAKER_27]: All is good in the world.

121
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:37,840
[SPEAKER_27]: All is good.

122
00:15:38,121 --> 00:15:38,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds good.

123
00:15:38,441 --> 00:15:39,262
[SPEAKER_27]: For the most part.

124
00:15:40,262 --> 00:15:40,863
[SPEAKER_07]: For the most part.

125
00:15:41,604 --> 00:15:42,765
[SPEAKER_27]: That's why we have F.E.s later.

126
00:15:42,785 --> 00:15:44,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, we'll hear about the other half during F.E.s.

127
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:47,308
[SPEAKER_07]: And also joining us, of course, where there's Mel B, there's Shark Skrull.

128
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:48,429
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, guys.

129
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:49,350
[SPEAKER_07]: How you doing, hon?

130
00:15:50,091 --> 00:15:51,772
[SPEAKER_16]: I brought Lumines for you to ogle.

131
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:54,114
[SPEAKER_07]: He actually has it, too.

132
00:15:54,214 --> 00:15:55,335
[SPEAKER_07]: I've already played it.

133
00:15:55,635 --> 00:15:57,016
[SPEAKER_07]: But you guys should do the wireless thing.

134
00:15:57,036 --> 00:15:57,497
[SPEAKER_07]: That might be fun.

135
00:15:57,517 --> 00:16:00,800
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, at least you're not going to be, like, obsessing over me just for my PSP.

136
00:16:01,934 --> 00:16:03,994
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to tell that story on the air because it's too funny.

137
00:16:04,455 --> 00:16:05,235
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll make you tell that later.

138
00:16:05,655 --> 00:16:08,375
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you should go check out his games.

139
00:16:08,395 --> 00:16:09,095
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got quite a few.

140
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:12,336
[SPEAKER_16]: So, anyway.

141
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:15,437
[SPEAKER_16]: Dude!

142
00:16:16,177 --> 00:16:16,697
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell?

143
00:16:16,737 --> 00:16:18,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that a Genesis portable thing?

144
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:19,698
[SPEAKER_15]: A Nomad?

145
00:16:20,858 --> 00:16:21,818
[SPEAKER_15]: I have one of those, too.

146
00:16:22,758 --> 00:16:26,679
[SPEAKER_15]: And you know that you can use the Game Gear battery pack on this, too.

147
00:16:28,314 --> 00:16:32,016
[SPEAKER_07]: This is like portable gaming convention in the tsunami zone tonight here.

148
00:16:33,277 --> 00:16:41,542
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm just checking out Moonwalker on the Nomad, and all I gotta say is, man, in times like these, who better of a superhero than a psychotic pedophile?

149
00:16:44,864 --> 00:16:47,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, in that break...

150
00:16:49,497 --> 00:16:55,839
[SPEAKER_07]: In that break, we heard Jesper Kidd with the Tengoku remix, or as some folks call it, .59.

151
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Before that, Akira Yamaoka, 250 BPM.

152
00:17:00,261 --> 00:17:02,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Before that, DJ Naguro, Lin, 1999.

153
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:03,662
[SPEAKER_07]: And starting us off, DJ Simon, 321 Stars.

154
00:17:06,503 --> 00:17:10,507
[SPEAKER_07]: All songs with numbers in them that break, because we're just stretching for themes tonight.

155
00:17:11,888 --> 00:17:15,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, this is the final night here in this studio.

156
00:17:15,811 --> 00:17:21,536
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be moving to a brand new studio in the next town over, Rancho Cambodia.

157
00:17:21,796 --> 00:17:22,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, I'm sorry, Rancho Cordova.

158
00:17:22,977 --> 00:17:25,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

159
00:17:27,284 --> 00:17:28,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

160
00:17:48,413 --> 00:17:50,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Look forward to that in future episodes and future webcams.

161
00:17:50,714 --> 00:17:53,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, though, the webcam tonight, not working.

162
00:17:53,795 --> 00:17:58,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead, we've patched through the Channel 10's Sacramento webcam, so you can just check out the river.

163
00:18:01,138 --> 00:18:01,839
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you really?

164
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:03,259
[SPEAKER_07]: I was there earlier today.

165
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:05,020
[SPEAKER_07]: And watch it slowly get darker.

166
00:18:06,261 --> 00:18:07,241
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.

167
00:18:07,601 --> 00:18:08,662
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, isn't it fascinating?

168
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:12,584
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about as exciting as our usual webcam when there's no guests here.

169
00:18:14,204 --> 00:18:15,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Where you get to watch the couch all night.

170
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:20,201
[SPEAKER_07]: and then you can see it slowly get darker outside anyway

171
00:18:22,884 --> 00:18:28,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Since we won't be in this new studio technically for two weeks, we are not going to be here next week.

172
00:18:29,068 --> 00:18:31,370
[SPEAKER_07]: We are going to run a pre-tape show, though.

173
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,131
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be partying next week.

174
00:18:33,191 --> 00:18:36,914
[SPEAKER_07]: So there will be a new episode of Orange Launch Radio, but it will be kind of different.

175
00:18:36,974 --> 00:18:41,838
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be kind of the way for us to kind of close the chapter on this.

176
00:18:42,018 --> 00:18:47,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Because really what's happening is that we're kind of, as I said, the theme is we are starting over.

177
00:18:48,632 --> 00:18:49,113
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

178
00:19:07,991 --> 00:19:10,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Radio, What Gamers Really Want to Know

179
00:19:29,153 --> 00:19:32,956
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of work and a lot of going to the gym and a lot of school.

180
00:19:33,617 --> 00:19:35,619
[SPEAKER_15]: I finished my retarded color wheel.

181
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:37,420
[SPEAKER_15]: Pictures of it abound on the internet.

182
00:19:40,783 --> 00:19:42,505
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just really been a whole bunch of nothing.

183
00:19:42,705 --> 00:19:45,267
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't get to play any Silent Hill, which I'm kind of disappointed about.

184
00:19:45,307 --> 00:19:52,613
[SPEAKER_15]: Although I did play Lego Star Wars on Xbox, which was actually pretty funny.

185
00:19:53,034 --> 00:19:56,817
[SPEAKER_15]: And you can play as General Grievous from the next movie.

186
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,274
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it worth the buy just to laugh at?

187
00:20:00,515 --> 00:20:02,516
[SPEAKER_15]: It's entertaining but kind of frustrating.

188
00:20:02,796 --> 00:20:05,138
[SPEAKER_15]: I would recommend it to kids except there's a couple of hard levels.

189
00:20:06,019 --> 00:20:09,821
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's still kind of funny seeing a Lego mace.

190
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:16,566
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reason I wanted to interrupt and ask is because my friend actually bought me Lego racers on the old 64 and that was pretty funny.

191
00:20:17,987 --> 00:20:19,048
[SPEAKER_15]: This one's just funny.

192
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:26,353
[SPEAKER_15]: But yesterday I hung out with Julie all day shopping.

193
00:20:27,481 --> 00:20:29,242
[SPEAKER_15]: Ooh, Trader Joe's.

194
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:30,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Girls going shopping.

195
00:20:30,603 --> 00:20:31,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Who would have thought?

196
00:20:31,184 --> 00:20:31,604
[SPEAKER_15]: For groceries.

197
00:20:32,124 --> 00:20:32,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, hey.

198
00:20:35,607 --> 00:20:36,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Girls going shopping!

199
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,111
[SPEAKER_15]: We did make fun of Paris Hilton a lot.

200
00:20:42,252 --> 00:20:42,732
[SPEAKER_07]: That's hot.

201
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:56,302
[SPEAKER_15]: And I thought, there was this girl who, we were at the J Street Mall today, and there was this girl who was absolutely slutted up, wearing one of those little skirts that look like, you know, a lampshade cover.

202
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,751
[SPEAKER_15]: and this halter thing.

203
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:02,813
[SPEAKER_15]: And I wanted to stop her and ask her, say, I'm doing interviews of prostitutes.

204
00:21:02,853 --> 00:21:04,033
[SPEAKER_15]: What's it like living on the streets?

205
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:10,096
[SPEAKER_15]: But I didn't feel too bitchy.

206
00:21:11,217 --> 00:21:11,977
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a first.

207
00:21:12,057 --> 00:21:13,658
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I had lunch at Hard Rock Cafe.

208
00:21:13,678 --> 00:21:14,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

209
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:16,739
[SPEAKER_15]: Do they have the Guinness burger?

210
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,040
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a Guinness burger?

211
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,261
[SPEAKER_15]: The buns are made with Guinness.

212
00:21:20,941 --> 00:21:21,602
[SPEAKER_15]: It's awesome.

213
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:24,503
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, carbs, yay.

214
00:21:24,763 --> 00:21:25,844
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to eat me this bun.

215
00:21:28,171 --> 00:21:30,232
[SPEAKER_15]: The buns are made with Guinness.

216
00:21:30,632 --> 00:21:30,932
Wow.

217
00:21:32,633 --> 00:21:34,154
[SPEAKER_15]: And, oh, Thursday.

218
00:21:34,674 --> 00:21:38,115
[SPEAKER_15]: Because there was no karaoke because someone decided to go to something.

219
00:21:38,795 --> 00:21:39,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

220
00:21:41,036 --> 00:21:43,197
[SPEAKER_15]: I went to Streets of London and had fish and chips and Guinness.

221
00:21:43,357 --> 00:21:43,897
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's fun.

222
00:21:44,197 --> 00:21:44,818
[SPEAKER_15]: That made me happy.

223
00:21:44,838 --> 00:21:46,298
[SPEAKER_15]: And they had real football on TV.

224
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:46,999
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

225
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:50,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Streets of London is like... I'm sure every big town has something like this.

226
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,801
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a British import pub, basically.

227
00:21:53,821 --> 00:21:54,482
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a pub.

228
00:21:54,702 --> 00:21:55,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they basically...

229
00:21:56,162 --> 00:22:02,367
[SPEAKER_07]: They've kind of taken it on a giant crane and craned it over here to the United States and set it down in major cities.

230
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:06,811
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can actually order cheaps the way they should be, the potatoes, you know.

231
00:22:07,171 --> 00:22:09,813
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you get to watch rugby and real football.

232
00:22:10,133 --> 00:22:12,375
[SPEAKER_15]: Real football because American football is crap.

233
00:22:13,456 --> 00:22:13,896
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

234
00:22:14,037 --> 00:22:16,699
[SPEAKER_15]: Rugby is what you need to be watching because those men get bloody.

235
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,722
[SPEAKER_15]: They have padding on their head and that's about it.

236
00:22:21,892 --> 00:22:25,935
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, because they have to, you know, have, you know, brain function, not like, what's-her-face.

237
00:22:27,056 --> 00:22:35,062
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, um, I went to the Crocker Museum today, just to look at stuff, because I had to do it for my art class.

238
00:22:35,482 --> 00:22:36,663
[SPEAKER_15]: There's some pretty cool stuff.

239
00:22:36,683 --> 00:22:39,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, what is, what is the Crocker Museum, for those not in the area?

240
00:22:39,165 --> 00:22:42,828
[SPEAKER_15]: It's an art museum, downtown SAC, in this really old house.

241
00:22:43,368 --> 00:22:47,811
[SPEAKER_15]: It made me think of a lot of the old houses in downtown Mobile, so it's sort of like, whoa, this is cool.

242
00:22:48,272 --> 00:22:50,253
[SPEAKER_15]: It's kind of a Victorian-style house, kind of.

243
00:22:51,134 --> 00:22:51,274
[SPEAKER_15]: Like,

244
00:22:52,602 --> 00:22:53,662
[SPEAKER_15]: The house itself was awesome.

245
00:22:53,682 --> 00:23:02,508
[SPEAKER_15]: They had a gallery for this Japanese artist there who did a lot of the representations of the old Kabuki actors.

246
00:23:02,728 --> 00:23:03,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

247
00:23:03,128 --> 00:23:03,568
[SPEAKER_15]: It's pretty cool.

248
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:07,030
[SPEAKER_15]: And then did things on the Genji story.

249
00:23:07,551 --> 00:23:08,171
[SPEAKER_15]: It was pretty cool.

250
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:13,715
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I went to this one exhibit, though.

251
00:23:14,155 --> 00:23:17,477
[SPEAKER_15]: I swear the sculptures in that were like right out of Silent Hill.

252
00:23:20,242 --> 00:23:21,643
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, this is pretty awesome.

253
00:23:23,343 --> 00:23:29,465
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I had to pick a picture that I really, really liked, and then I had to pick something that I hated and say why I hated it.

254
00:23:29,905 --> 00:23:35,427
[SPEAKER_15]: And the one I picked that I hated was called, like, Angels a la Mode or something.

255
00:23:36,728 --> 00:23:41,469
[SPEAKER_15]: It was this ceramic, shiny lady with this big poofy hair and little angels hanging all over her.

256
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:42,870
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, this is ugly.

257
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,351
[SPEAKER_16]: That is a really odd comment to come back in.

258
00:23:46,431 --> 00:23:48,512
[SPEAKER_16]: I just start hearing about a ceramic lady with angels.

259
00:23:50,256 --> 00:23:51,137
[SPEAKER_15]: I went to the museum today.

260
00:23:55,519 --> 00:24:01,222
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the picture that I really liked, when you walk into the gallery, it's humongous, it takes up almost this whole piece of wall.

261
00:24:02,143 --> 00:24:10,927
[SPEAKER_15]: It's this old man who sort of looks like Patrick Stewart, sort of, but really, you know, shaggy beard, shaggy hair, laying down like he's dying.

262
00:24:11,548 --> 00:24:13,689
[SPEAKER_15]: But he looks really aware of himself.

263
00:24:14,489 --> 00:24:16,971
[SPEAKER_15]: But as you approach the picture... Sounds kind of erotic.

264
00:24:18,427 --> 00:24:21,008
[SPEAKER_15]: There's these pastel figures all scattered about it.

265
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:31,134
[SPEAKER_15]: And for a moment I thought that this might be, it's called a glique, which is a giclee, that's what it's called, which is a digital... Wasn't that a movie with Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez?

266
00:24:31,254 --> 00:24:31,534
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

267
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:31,994
[SPEAKER_07]: A giclee?

268
00:24:34,636 --> 00:24:35,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Just teasing.

269
00:24:36,757 --> 00:24:40,399
[SPEAKER_15]: But what that is is a digital image that's transferred to canvas.

270
00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:46,342
[SPEAKER_15]: And this was actually all done in acrylics on canvas, on this massive canvas.

271
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:47,207
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

272
00:25:17,406 --> 00:25:18,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Your laundry's going crazy.

273
00:25:18,666 --> 00:25:20,507
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I better go rescue my laundry from your machine.

274
00:25:20,527 --> 00:25:22,788
[SPEAKER_16]: What I was going to say is the washer walking off.

275
00:25:23,608 --> 00:25:24,989
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like, that's it, I quit.

276
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:27,730
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess so.

277
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,690
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what happened there.

278
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:29,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

279
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:31,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, that's a first.

280
00:25:31,551 --> 00:25:33,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, anyway, moving on with how was your week, how was your day.

281
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:41,535
[SPEAKER_07]: So hopefully if DarkSakura can get some pictures of her artistic day, she can post those up on the forums and you guys can check that out.

282
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, moving on with how was your week, how was your day?

283
00:25:44,813 --> 00:25:47,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's just go Shark Scroll, you got a mic next to you, why not?

284
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:47,695
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up?

285
00:25:48,976 --> 00:25:53,981
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, obviously my day involved coming here, just for the heck of it.

286
00:25:54,021 --> 00:25:57,784
[SPEAKER_16]: I was like, yesterday I'm like, it's the last episode of Orange Lounge in that studio.

287
00:25:58,125 --> 00:25:58,645
[SPEAKER_16]: You wanna go?

288
00:25:58,665 --> 00:26:01,408
[SPEAKER_16]: And that was that.

289
00:26:01,488 --> 00:26:02,669
[SPEAKER_16]: Very cool.

290
00:26:03,209 --> 00:26:05,912
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I got a new job, new job is

291
00:26:06,457 --> 00:26:07,297
[SPEAKER_16]: Really quite nice.

292
00:26:07,517 --> 00:26:10,518
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a temp for a few months, so I get paid weekly, which is nifty.

293
00:26:11,218 --> 00:26:16,319
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's nice to work at a place where you don't feel like everyone's going to backstab you at any given second.

294
00:26:16,719 --> 00:26:18,719
[SPEAKER_16]: And you actually enjoy working with your coworkers.

295
00:26:18,819 --> 00:26:20,600
[SPEAKER_16]: So I've been very mellow lately.

296
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,740
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's a good thing.

297
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,120
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.

298
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:22,540
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.

299
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,720
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, so I'm kind of boring, but that's okay.

300
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,401
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's all right.

301
00:26:25,901 --> 00:26:26,621
[SPEAKER_04]: New jobs are fun.

302
00:26:27,361 --> 00:26:28,861
[SPEAKER_16]: And new jobs with lots of money are fun, too.

303
00:26:29,261 --> 00:26:29,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, they are.

304
00:26:30,201 --> 00:26:30,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

305
00:26:31,282 --> 00:26:31,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else?

306
00:26:32,322 --> 00:26:32,362
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

307
00:26:32,402 --> 00:26:33,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Any gaming stuff?

308
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:39,263
[SPEAKER_16]: I've just been playing, like, Luminez, and I alternate between Luminez on the PSP and Zookeeper on DS.

309
00:26:41,504 --> 00:26:44,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, you and Loki outside, was he showing you how to hack your PSP?

310
00:26:44,545 --> 00:26:48,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that what he was doing outside, trying to hack into the neighbor's wireless internet?

311
00:26:48,267 --> 00:26:48,807
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, he did!

312
00:26:52,009 --> 00:26:54,070
[SPEAKER_16]: It was not only tried, it was succeeded.

313
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:56,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have Wipeout on your PSP?

314
00:26:56,291 --> 00:26:57,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I have Wipeout.

315
00:26:57,191 --> 00:26:59,492
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't have it with me, but I have Wipeout, so I was finding out how to do it.

316
00:26:59,633 --> 00:27:00,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

317
00:27:00,373 --> 00:27:01,974
[SPEAKER_07]: So learning from the best, I guess.

318
00:27:02,014 --> 00:27:02,554
[SPEAKER_16]: That's right.

319
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:06,856
[SPEAKER_07]: So now you can drive around the neighborhood and see what wireless internet you can hack into.

320
00:27:06,896 --> 00:27:11,958
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I have wireless at my house, so if I'm feeling lazy and just don't want to get on my laptop, you know, there you go.

321
00:27:12,318 --> 00:27:12,699
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

322
00:27:13,239 --> 00:27:13,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

323
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:16,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, moving on.

324
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, Mr. Mel B, how was your week?

325
00:27:19,082 --> 00:27:19,442
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your day?

326
00:27:20,562 --> 00:27:21,583
[SPEAKER_27]: Week was pretty interesting.

327
00:27:21,603 --> 00:27:32,188
[SPEAKER_27]: I actually started a new job myself on Monday, working as an editor at this one place that actually does a lot of assessment and standards for kids, so like grades 5 through 11, I'd be

328
00:27:33,607 --> 00:27:39,410
[SPEAKER_27]: Basically editing and proofing a bunch of assessment tests, something like CTBS, SAT type stuff.

329
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:44,692
[SPEAKER_27]: So it's kind of a cool job to get paid a good amount of money to tell people they're wrong.

330
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:51,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Did Jamie just yell for a job application from the back?

331
00:27:51,395 --> 00:27:54,236
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

332
00:27:57,458 --> 00:27:59,699
[SPEAKER_07]: For those who didn't hear that, Jamie said, I'll do that for free.

333
00:28:01,048 --> 00:28:12,198
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, it's good times, aside from the commute, being in, like, San Francisco, and I'm in, like, Redwood City, it's about, like, half hour and plus parking, and the city ain't always that great, but it's all good, but, uh, get a nice view.

334
00:28:12,618 --> 00:28:21,285
[SPEAKER_27]: Everything is pretty cool, I mean, it's, like, one of the most kickback jobs, like, it's eight hours, but I get my stuff done by one o'clock, and then I try to go to my boss's office to find something, you know, like, what to do.

335
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:25,209
[SPEAKER_27]: She's stuck in meetings till, like, four o'clock, so I got three hours of dead time.

336
00:28:25,768 --> 00:28:29,570
[SPEAKER_27]: So, you know, it's all good, and I get to listen to Orange Lounge all day, so hey.

337
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:30,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright!

338
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,131
[SPEAKER_27]: You know?

339
00:28:31,151 --> 00:28:31,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Like that.

340
00:28:32,131 --> 00:28:33,512
[SPEAKER_27]: So, I'm feeling that.

341
00:28:34,912 --> 00:28:35,973
[SPEAKER_27]: Other crazy stuff.

342
00:28:37,134 --> 00:28:42,876
[SPEAKER_27]: Actually, it was funny, it was something mentioned on, I guess it was, yeah, DDR Freak a couple weeks ago.

343
00:28:43,236 --> 00:28:48,119
[SPEAKER_27]: Someone had put up, like, an unofficial, like, top 50 freestyle routines of all time in, like, North America.

344
00:28:48,739 --> 00:28:50,060
[SPEAKER_27]: And me and my boys, like...

345
00:28:50,987 --> 00:28:56,288
[SPEAKER_27]: We started coming up with this idea, like, maybe we should get a couple people, like, all together, get some ideas around it.

346
00:28:56,308 --> 00:29:05,931
[SPEAKER_27]: We actually wanted to put up a list of, like, top 100, you know, freestyles of, like, North American history, like, coming from a freestyler's perspective, coming from, like, someone who's just an avid fan.

347
00:29:06,031 --> 00:29:09,492
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's something that we're going to do, like, probably in a month or two.

348
00:29:10,112 --> 00:29:10,792
[SPEAKER_03]: I got it right now.

349
00:29:10,812 --> 00:29:17,994
[SPEAKER_03]: The first annual DDR freestyle history, I don't know, they can do some sort of, like, award show for that.

350
00:29:18,598 --> 00:29:20,780
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, have best improv routine.

351
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:24,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, just do I Love the Freestyle and get House Sparks.

352
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:25,484
[SPEAKER_03]: No, thank you.

353
00:29:25,524 --> 00:29:26,404
[SPEAKER_07]: That was my idea.

354
00:29:26,444 --> 00:29:28,566
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get House Sparks to comment on everything.

355
00:29:28,626 --> 00:29:30,668
[SPEAKER_36]: I mean, yeah, we can start it off in like 1999.

356
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:37,534
[SPEAKER_36]: And then we can go through every year who the big names were in 2000, 2001, all the way until now.

357
00:29:37,894 --> 00:29:40,456
[SPEAKER_27]: Like, yo, 2001, hand slaps and knee drops.

358
00:29:40,576 --> 00:29:42,257
[SPEAKER_27]: Yo, that was ill, man.

359
00:29:42,297 --> 00:29:43,559
[SPEAKER_27]: That was the greatest.

360
00:29:43,859 --> 00:29:44,900
[SPEAKER_15]: Post-18 videos.

361
00:29:47,998 --> 00:29:52,421
[SPEAKER_36]: You know, I was actually considering walking around with my Turnaroshi trophy, like Owen Hart.

362
00:29:55,542 --> 00:29:57,604
[SPEAKER_23]: That's right, I totally forgot you had one.

363
00:29:57,624 --> 00:29:58,564
[SPEAKER_27]: Wow.

364
00:29:58,604 --> 00:30:04,888
[SPEAKER_27]: But it's just some stuff like that, and we actually want to do something with Spot sometime when we can actually get, like, our database back in order.

365
00:30:04,908 --> 00:30:06,749
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, Spot is going to be working again.

366
00:30:07,209 --> 00:30:12,212
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, right now, the thing is, like, our webmaster, you know, got our hands on our back end is in China right now, so...

367
00:30:15,134 --> 00:30:17,757
[SPEAKER_07]: That sucks when your website goes to China.

368
00:30:18,538 --> 00:30:20,100
[SPEAKER_07]: That's no fun at all.

369
00:30:22,542 --> 00:30:23,603
[SPEAKER_27]: But you know, we want to do something like that.

370
00:30:23,623 --> 00:30:25,846
[SPEAKER_27]: We actually want to get videos back up and all that kind of stuff.

371
00:30:25,906 --> 00:30:30,111
[SPEAKER_27]: It's like, because a lot of people, they've only seen stuff maybe 2002, 2005, you know.

372
00:30:30,151 --> 00:30:33,054
[SPEAKER_27]: It'd just be something because there's really nothing better to do.

373
00:30:33,683 --> 00:30:39,725
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean... Since there's no new arcade mixes or anything, we'll just reminisce about old arcade mixes.

374
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:44,166
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, the longer we live, the more we remember DDR used to be good.

375
00:30:46,667 --> 00:30:53,649
[SPEAKER_27]: But speaking of that, I actually also posted up an article... If this is about what I think it is, I want to talk about this in more detail later.

376
00:30:53,969 --> 00:30:56,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, yeah, well... Don't blow it just yet.

377
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:59,971
[SPEAKER_27]: As a teaser, there was something that I posted up that will probably be talked about later.

378
00:31:00,231 --> 00:31:01,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, definitely.

379
00:31:03,264 --> 00:31:05,687
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, we have three hours to fill, don't blow it all now.

380
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:22,343
[SPEAKER_27]: See, other than that, just been kicking back for now, waiting for my E3 guest passes to come in next week, and all of a sudden I'm realizing there's a lot of friends I never knew I had, you know?

381
00:31:24,265 --> 00:31:27,528
[SPEAKER_27]: You know how that goes, it's like, I don't know, the way I see it, it's

382
00:31:28,106 --> 00:31:33,428
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, people usually offer, you know, if you get me into E3, I'll get you, you know, this, this, and this.

383
00:31:33,448 --> 00:31:35,929
[SPEAKER_27]: Man, what I gotta do is just get this stuff on eBay.

384
00:31:35,969 --> 00:31:39,310
[SPEAKER_27]: Like, I got Dutch Auction 10, you know, passes right here.

385
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:40,051
[SPEAKER_27]: Everyone bids.

386
00:31:40,071 --> 00:31:41,471
[SPEAKER_27]: You're like, I'll get you dinner.

387
00:31:41,611 --> 00:31:42,772
[SPEAKER_27]: Reserve not yet met.

388
00:31:45,272 --> 00:31:51,675
[SPEAKER_27]: So, you know, it's just interesting to see how everyone becomes all chummy like a month before it happens.

389
00:31:51,755 --> 00:31:52,775
[SPEAKER_27]: But, you know, it's all good.

390
00:31:53,175 --> 00:31:54,416
[SPEAKER_27]: It's the price of fame, you know.

391
00:31:54,966 --> 00:31:59,410
[SPEAKER_16]: It'll be even more interesting to see how chummy people get with me when they see I have a media pass and can get fun goodies.

392
00:32:01,852 --> 00:32:04,394
[SPEAKER_27]: But, you know, that's pretty much the week in general.

393
00:32:04,434 --> 00:32:05,675
[SPEAKER_27]: Everything's been pretty cool.

394
00:32:06,496 --> 00:32:12,081
[SPEAKER_27]: As far as gaming, when I get a chance, I steal Luminous from Shark's Girl.

395
00:32:12,101 --> 00:32:17,246
[SPEAKER_27]: Other than that, I've just been like, I pretty much kill time playing San Andreas for the hell of it.

396
00:32:17,886 --> 00:32:20,589
[SPEAKER_27]: Because there's like so many, because I already beat the game like once.

397
00:32:20,629 --> 00:32:21,389
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm just trying to go for 100%.

398
00:32:23,072 --> 00:32:27,413
[SPEAKER_27]: So it's good times and that's basically the week in a nutshell.

399
00:32:28,273 --> 00:32:28,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

400
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:33,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Islander, how was your week?

401
00:32:33,835 --> 00:32:34,815
[SPEAKER_36]: How was your day?

402
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:35,535
[SPEAKER_36]: Week's been alright.

403
00:32:36,735 --> 00:32:37,195
[SPEAKER_36]: Let's see.

404
00:32:37,696 --> 00:32:39,416
[SPEAKER_36]: Work is pretty much there.

405
00:32:40,136 --> 00:32:44,797
[SPEAKER_36]: The only thing that I've been playing all week was actually Leisure Suit Larry Magna Cum Laude.

406
00:32:47,838 --> 00:32:48,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Any particular reason why?

407
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:51,399
[SPEAKER_36]: I wanted it and it was on sale for like

408
00:32:52,649 --> 00:32:52,909
[SPEAKER_36]: 30 bucks.

409
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,210
[SPEAKER_36]: So I was like, alright, cool.

410
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:54,851
[SPEAKER_36]: I'll pick that up.

411
00:32:55,451 --> 00:32:59,934
[SPEAKER_36]: Finished it in like, I don't know, maybe seven hours.

412
00:33:02,496 --> 00:33:06,058
[SPEAKER_36]: And aside from that, not really a whole lot of too much.

413
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:10,181
[SPEAKER_36]: I actually went and played P.I.U.

414
00:33:10,201 --> 00:33:12,562
[SPEAKER_36]: today for the first time in like ages.

415
00:33:12,802 --> 00:33:14,744
[SPEAKER_07]: And to the non-hipsters, that's Pump It Up.

416
00:33:15,484 --> 00:33:16,385
[SPEAKER_07]: P.I.U., Pump It Up.

417
00:33:19,687 --> 00:33:21,328
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes, and I actually did play that song, actually.

418
00:33:22,614 --> 00:33:29,035
[SPEAKER_36]: But yeah, it was just pretty interesting just to go to a place that had video games and you put a dollar in the machine and it actually gave out quarters.

419
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:31,016
[SPEAKER_36]: It's like, wow.

420
00:33:31,036 --> 00:33:32,676
[SPEAKER_36]: It's like I had to use it somewhere else.

421
00:33:35,357 --> 00:33:37,377
[SPEAKER_07]: I can get laundry money from a pump-it-up machine?

422
00:33:37,937 --> 00:33:38,457
[SPEAKER_36]: Yeah, really.

423
00:33:38,477 --> 00:33:39,437
[SPEAKER_36]: It was hot.

424
00:33:39,537 --> 00:33:40,498
[SPEAKER_36]: You have no idea.

425
00:33:41,718 --> 00:33:42,938
[SPEAKER_36]: But no, let's see.

426
00:33:43,318 --> 00:33:45,239
[SPEAKER_36]: Oh, I went to Denio's, walked around for a bit.

427
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:47,659
[SPEAKER_36]: I found the greatest Eddie Guerrero shirts.

428
00:33:48,979 --> 00:33:49,799
[SPEAKER_36]: It was hell.

429
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:50,860
[SPEAKER_36]: It was all hell.

430
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:51,260
[SPEAKER_36]: It sucked.

431
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:54,961
[SPEAKER_27]: This entire week sucked.

432
00:34:11,398 --> 00:34:15,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I started off with, I got, okay, first I started my new job, game sales.

433
00:34:15,761 --> 00:34:17,763
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all good, you know, starting to train and stuff.

434
00:34:18,984 --> 00:34:20,285
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's just grueling.

435
00:34:20,305 --> 00:34:28,931
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just very, they're having me, I'm fighting with this stupid person in Dallas because they think they know everything about, you know, certain games that are coming out.

436
00:34:29,111 --> 00:34:31,012
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been doing this for 18 years!

437
00:34:31,072 --> 00:34:37,497
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, first she, I'm like, she gives me this thing that says, you know, our new releases are coming up in May.

438
00:34:37,597 --> 00:34:39,939
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first thing that's on there is Ape Escape for the PSP.

439
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:43,980
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I think the state's wrong because it's in stores right now.

440
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,200
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one of the launch titles.

441
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,020
[SPEAKER_16]: No, it got pushed back to me.

442
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:48,181
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's in the stores.

443
00:34:48,261 --> 00:34:54,162
[SPEAKER_03]: I picked it up with my hand, thought about buying it, saw it sucked, and then put it back down.

444
00:34:54,942 --> 00:35:00,004
[SPEAKER_03]: And then she's like, there's this other title on there that was, what was it?

445
00:35:00,764 --> 00:35:03,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey Arnold, the movie, the game for the GBA.

446
00:35:03,884 --> 00:35:05,145
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, hold on, hold on.

447
00:35:05,965 --> 00:35:09,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey Arnold, the movie, the game.

448
00:35:09,906 --> 00:35:10,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

449
00:35:11,667 --> 00:35:19,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and that game came out three years ago, when the movie came out, and she still insists it's a new release.

450
00:35:19,049 --> 00:35:23,150
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, okay, so that's when I had to get my boss involved.

451
00:35:23,471 --> 00:35:30,513
[SPEAKER_03]: He saw the emails go back and forth, and he joked with me, because he actually has a, he's understanding, so he's like, so you're trying to piss off, you know, the neighbor?

452
00:35:31,633 --> 00:35:33,053
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck is that kid doing right there?

453
00:35:33,794 --> 00:35:34,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, giant paper airplane.

454
00:35:37,148 --> 00:35:38,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking kids, stop distracting me!

455
00:35:39,249 --> 00:35:48,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, you're trying to piss off the Dallas people, but anyways, I'm trying to piss off the neighbor throwing the giant paper airplane.

456
00:35:50,672 --> 00:35:51,712
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell is wrong?

457
00:35:52,532 --> 00:35:55,173
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of inbred people do we have living around here, I swear?

458
00:35:55,777 --> 00:35:58,418
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyways, back to... I don't think we were in Mississippi.

459
00:35:59,058 --> 00:36:00,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to the story, okay.

460
00:36:00,799 --> 00:36:02,219
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, this has been going on all week.

461
00:36:02,279 --> 00:36:10,783
[SPEAKER_03]: What's kind of cool, though, is they're actually kind of serious about the game side of everything, so they're going to convert our conference room into a game room with a giant plasma screen TV, so that's kind of cool.

462
00:36:12,532 --> 00:36:13,433
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've been doing that.

463
00:36:13,753 --> 00:36:17,937
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this week, this weekend, I got to move!

464
00:36:18,517 --> 00:36:19,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

465
00:36:19,438 --> 00:36:21,340
[SPEAKER_03]: So this entire week was packing.

466
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,683
[SPEAKER_03]: And then today and yesterday was moving.

467
00:36:25,223 --> 00:36:26,444
[SPEAKER_03]: And that sucked.

468
00:36:27,065 --> 00:36:28,826
[SPEAKER_03]: And I still have tons more left.

469
00:36:29,126 --> 00:36:31,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just put it this way.

470
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:34,791
[SPEAKER_03]: That arcade cabinet, I think, was never meant to move at all.

471
00:36:35,152 --> 00:36:36,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, I tried moving it today.

472
00:36:36,993 --> 00:36:40,116
[SPEAKER_03]: First thing that happened, the wheels pushed through the bottom on the front.

473
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:43,002
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, ah shit, that sucks, now it won't roll.

474
00:36:43,382 --> 00:36:50,988
[SPEAKER_03]: So then we sat here, leaned the cabinet back on its back wheels for a while, and I tried to reinforce the bottom with screws.

475
00:36:51,388 --> 00:36:54,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Set it back down, got it to the door, and it busted through the bottom again.

476
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,391
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, ah, fuck this.

477
00:36:55,892 --> 00:36:57,373
[SPEAKER_03]: So we finally got everything going.

478
00:36:58,514 --> 00:37:01,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, these kids are old school paper airplanes.

479
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:02,297
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear to God.

480
00:37:02,657 --> 00:37:03,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so we...

481
00:37:05,834 --> 00:37:07,275
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

482
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:12,359
[SPEAKER_07]: When it comes down, when the battle is said and done, DS versus PSP, the winner, paper airplanes.

483
00:37:14,561 --> 00:37:15,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

484
00:37:17,163 --> 00:37:17,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God.

485
00:37:17,643 --> 00:37:25,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so finally, we got the cabinet to the house, and we had to wheel it around and finally got it in there.

486
00:37:25,349 --> 00:37:28,051
[SPEAKER_03]: We had to dodge this light that was by my door, and

487
00:37:28,889 --> 00:37:33,551
[SPEAKER_03]: The Fire Extinguisher in its glass case, you know, I had to dodge all that stuff.

488
00:37:34,532 --> 00:37:35,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Barely fit through.

489
00:37:35,372 --> 00:37:37,013
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you should have seen the couch yesterday.

490
00:37:37,033 --> 00:37:44,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, see, the way our apartment is set up, you've kind of got the two apartments right there and there's like a walkway that goes in front of both of them.

491
00:37:44,356 --> 00:37:49,218
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the apartment next to me has the sidewalk that's actually coming, you know, away from the apartment.

492
00:37:49,919 --> 00:37:55,801
[SPEAKER_03]: And for me, all I've got is this hole between the bush that's just about enough, you know, wide enough to fit the couch.

493
00:37:56,422 --> 00:37:56,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Just barely.

494
00:37:56,742 --> 00:37:56,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Barely.

495
00:37:58,186 --> 00:37:59,907
[SPEAKER_03]: The fuck is my phone ringing for?

496
00:38:00,607 --> 00:38:01,327
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn it.

497
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:02,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

498
00:38:06,829 --> 00:38:07,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello?

499
00:38:08,349 --> 00:38:09,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you forget you were trying to do a show?

500
00:38:12,311 --> 00:38:14,931
[SPEAKER_16]: This is why cell phones need to be turned off during the show.

501
00:38:15,712 --> 00:38:18,032
[SPEAKER_16]: Should we start playing the Jeopardy theme or something?

502
00:38:19,593 --> 00:38:20,933
[SPEAKER_07]: No, start making orgasm noises.

503
00:38:21,774 --> 00:38:23,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, what that was, that was Nelly.

504
00:38:24,494 --> 00:38:25,895
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get into this too, okay?

505
00:38:26,616 --> 00:38:38,560
[SPEAKER_03]: She was asking if I needed pants, because... Because you see... Because you see, yesterday, while moving... Hold on, hold on.

506
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me just... Okay, let me think about this.

507
00:38:41,241 --> 00:38:48,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Mellie knows that you do a radio show on the internet that is nominated for Broadcaster of the Year.

508
00:38:49,383 --> 00:38:49,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay?

509
00:38:50,164 --> 00:38:53,265
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are one of five stations nominated Broadcaster of the Year.

510
00:38:53,385 --> 00:38:54,325
[SPEAKER_06]: So she understands...

511
00:38:55,149 --> 00:38:58,192
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of commitment you put in Sunday nights.

512
00:38:58,793 --> 00:39:03,837
[SPEAKER_06]: She calls you, interrupts the show to ask you if you have pants.

513
00:39:04,678 --> 00:39:06,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, I'm getting to that.

514
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, gosh.

515
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,182
[SPEAKER_03]: I was the one that asked her, okay?

516
00:39:09,463 --> 00:39:14,007
[SPEAKER_03]: She was nice enough to go, to offer to get me pants at Walmart because the, you know.

517
00:39:14,946 --> 00:39:15,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

518
00:39:31,428 --> 00:39:41,535
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, I had busted pants, you know, I have one pair of pants left that I'm not really sure if I have, so just to be on the safe side, I got a backup pair of pants just to make sure.

519
00:39:41,855 --> 00:39:42,916
[SPEAKER_10]: No!

520
00:39:43,537 --> 00:39:45,838
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you having problems with your ass?

521
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:58,107
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyways, that is why she called, because she wanted me to, I was supposed to check to see if I had the pants in the dryer, and I didn't quite get to do that before the show, so...

522
00:39:58,968 --> 00:39:59,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

523
00:40:18,246 --> 00:40:24,790
[SPEAKER_03]: So then I had to go next door and drop the car off so, you know, I could see what's wrong because the check engine light's like, SOMETHING'S WRONG!

524
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,130
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm not telling you what.

525
00:40:26,531 --> 00:40:27,311
[SPEAKER_03]: SOMETHING'S WRONG!

526
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:31,213
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be as little as the gas cap, or it could be your engine's falling apart.

527
00:40:31,693 --> 00:40:34,235
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're not gonna tell you, I'm just gonna turn on the light.

528
00:40:35,035 --> 00:40:39,538
[SPEAKER_03]: And you gotta take it down to the shop so they can laugh at you if it's something stupid, you know.

529
00:40:39,918 --> 00:40:45,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I checked the gas, you know, cap three times, all my fluids are fine, so it's nothing I did to the car.

530
00:40:46,368 --> 00:40:47,529
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the car falling apart.

531
00:40:47,549 --> 00:40:48,610
[SPEAKER_15]: Your fluids are fine.

532
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Does the car need pants?

533
00:40:52,233 --> 00:40:53,353
[SPEAKER_03]: The car does not need pants.

534
00:40:53,934 --> 00:40:55,755
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, last week... Give me pants!

535
00:40:56,556 --> 00:41:04,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, last week... Yes, I've seen... Yeah, that's true.

536
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:10,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so, pants, car, moving stuff aside, it's been an okay week.

537
00:41:10,486 --> 00:41:15,230
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it's one hell of a hectic week, and it's not going to get any better this week, so...

538
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:16,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, oh well.

539
00:41:16,955 --> 00:41:21,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Our chat room, which I haven't plugged yet, www.orangeontrainer.com, click on chat.

540
00:41:21,056 --> 00:41:22,317
[SPEAKER_07]: There's already a ton of people in there.

541
00:41:22,357 --> 00:41:26,199
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need to plug it because it's a party in there already, but hopefully some of you guys will want to join it.

542
00:41:27,459 --> 00:41:31,121
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have the chat room, unfortunately, on the TV studio cam today.

543
00:41:31,241 --> 00:41:33,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Only I and DarkSakura can see it.

544
00:41:33,302 --> 00:41:39,704
[SPEAKER_07]: But we will pass along the messages, such as Firebomber has an explanation for why Loki is ripping all his pants.

545
00:41:40,805 --> 00:41:42,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Firebomber is suggesting you're getting fat, fatty.

546
00:41:44,427 --> 00:41:50,071
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm, okay, I'm not getting fat, it's actually not my ass that's ripping, it's the fucking crotch that's ripped out.

547
00:41:50,411 --> 00:41:52,513
[SPEAKER_07]: My nuts are too big for the pants.

548
00:41:52,853 --> 00:41:56,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on, and then it goes on to say, Fatty McTubbs might have to lose some tons.

549
00:41:57,637 --> 00:42:02,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I've fucking got tons of exercise this week, lifting the goddamn couch and moving the cabinet and shit.

550
00:42:03,141 --> 00:42:05,903
[SPEAKER_03]: I've lifted enough boxes and done enough exercise this week.

551
00:42:06,363 --> 00:42:10,326
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was sex involved too, so goddammit, I've had my fill of exercise.

552
00:42:15,017 --> 00:42:15,598
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm finished.

553
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:18,220
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, look, now you've done it.

554
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,301
[SPEAKER_16]: Rob is speechless.

555
00:42:20,362 --> 00:42:21,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Angel, how was your week?

556
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:21,723
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your day?

557
00:42:23,965 --> 00:42:25,526
[SPEAKER_00]: How the hell am I going to top that?

558
00:42:25,647 --> 00:42:25,927
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait.

559
00:42:28,109 --> 00:42:29,030
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what Nellie asked.

560
00:42:36,076 --> 00:42:38,058
[SPEAKER_15]: Whole new meaning to the term Swellhead.

561
00:42:38,818 --> 00:42:40,200
[SPEAKER_03]: She wasn't complaining this morning.

562
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,716
[SPEAKER_15]: You're listening to KTMI.

563
00:42:46,796 --> 00:42:48,538
[SPEAKER_15]: Too much information all the time.

564
00:42:52,441 --> 00:42:54,602
[SPEAKER_07]: We're experiencing technical difficulties right now.

565
00:42:57,144 --> 00:42:58,105
[SPEAKER_06]: The host is speechless.

566
00:42:58,765 --> 00:43:00,126
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got big balls.

567
00:43:00,507 --> 00:43:01,788
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got big balls.

568
00:43:02,088 --> 00:43:03,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's try this again.

569
00:43:04,309 --> 00:43:05,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Angel, how was your week?

570
00:43:05,811 --> 00:43:06,491
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your day?

571
00:43:06,891 --> 00:43:07,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Pants.

572
00:43:10,914 --> 00:43:11,595
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, um...

573
00:43:12,634 --> 00:43:20,856
[SPEAKER_15]: Just, uh, working on school stuff, and, uh, work, and yada yada, and... Okay, guys!

574
00:43:22,717 --> 00:43:24,817
[SPEAKER_15]: Working on school and pets.

575
00:43:27,018 --> 00:43:29,219
[SPEAKER_15]: My pants are probably fine, thank you very much!

576
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:40,982
[SPEAKER_16]: It could be a fortune cookie, I don't know, that's up to, uh... Instead of, like, adding in bed to your fortune, you add with pants?

577
00:43:43,608 --> 00:43:44,068
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.

578
00:43:46,229 --> 00:43:46,809
[SPEAKER_15]: That could work.

579
00:43:47,049 --> 00:43:47,389
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.

580
00:43:47,969 --> 00:43:48,609
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no, no.

581
00:43:48,629 --> 00:43:49,530
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make me think about that.

582
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:52,070
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.

583
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:55,671
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, um, I actually found time to play Final Fantasy XI this week.

584
00:43:56,251 --> 00:43:56,671
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.

585
00:43:57,952 --> 00:43:58,392
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.

586
00:43:58,452 --> 00:44:00,692
[SPEAKER_00]: Not if I just picked it up this week.

587
00:44:01,352 --> 00:44:02,193
[SPEAKER_00]: All the time, anyway.

588
00:44:04,113 --> 00:44:07,354
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, okay.

589
00:44:07,374 --> 00:44:07,974
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.

590
00:44:08,214 --> 00:44:08,614
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm done.

591
00:44:09,214 --> 00:44:11,975
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, for the record, getting MPK just kind of

592
00:44:13,078 --> 00:44:14,960
[SPEAKER_00]: Wrong and interesting at the same time.

593
00:44:16,481 --> 00:44:21,986
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm going to let Rob maybe fill in that blank because I'm not going to sit there and explain it again.

594
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,488
[SPEAKER_07]: MPK and Final Fantasy XI.

595
00:44:24,528 --> 00:44:27,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, she got scary monsters trained on top of her.

596
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:28,811
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's no fun at all.

597
00:44:29,832 --> 00:44:32,675
[SPEAKER_07]: You should call GM on that guy.

598
00:44:32,915 --> 00:44:33,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

599
00:44:34,116 --> 00:44:35,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, right.

600
00:44:36,138 --> 00:44:36,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

601
00:44:37,246 --> 00:44:39,267
[SPEAKER_07]: My week and my day was pretty cool.

602
00:44:39,347 --> 00:44:42,449
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't top the pants thing, though, honestly, so I don't really know what I can say.

603
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:44,370
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't top pants.

604
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:53,115
[SPEAKER_07]: I did see Margaret Cho on Thursday, which was pretty cool, except it was a lot of recycled stuff from the last tour, which was kind of sad.

605
00:44:54,756 --> 00:44:55,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, did you find pants?

606
00:44:56,377 --> 00:44:57,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki found pants, everybody.

607
00:44:58,378 --> 00:45:01,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, what else is going on?

608
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:01,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I...

609
00:45:06,616 --> 00:45:07,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you say that on mic?

610
00:45:07,817 --> 00:45:19,183
[SPEAKER_36]: Okay, now yes, he did find pants, but for the record, he is currently wearing shorts, so it's not like he's completely bottomless here.

611
00:45:21,024 --> 00:45:23,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Something to note here.

612
00:45:24,686 --> 00:45:27,627
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I've also kind of been moving a little bit as well.

613
00:45:27,927 --> 00:45:29,628
[SPEAKER_07]: As I said, you know, got the keys to the new place.

614
00:45:29,688 --> 00:45:32,390
[SPEAKER_07]: My big move stuff comes next Sunday though, so I'm still here.

615
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:35,091
[SPEAKER_16]: I was going to say, for having move stuff, there sure is a

616
00:45:38,492 --> 00:45:42,374
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not moving until Sunday, but I kind of checked out the new place and that's about it.

617
00:45:42,454 --> 00:45:43,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing big.

618
00:45:44,795 --> 00:45:45,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

619
00:45:46,275 --> 00:45:46,836
[SPEAKER_07]: That's about it.

620
00:45:47,376 --> 00:45:49,797
[SPEAKER_07]: I really can't top the other stuff going on.

621
00:45:51,657 --> 00:45:53,078
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we weren't here last week.

622
00:45:54,098 --> 00:45:56,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody kind of had their own thing going on last weekend.

623
00:45:56,159 --> 00:45:59,540
[SPEAKER_07]: I went and saw Garbage, the band, in San Francisco, so that was cool.

624
00:46:01,521 --> 00:46:02,362
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not garbage.

625
00:46:02,462 --> 00:46:03,282
[SPEAKER_07]: They're actually pretty good.

626
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,841
[SPEAKER_16]: Blah to you, I say, but I can top you.

627
00:46:06,942 --> 00:46:09,103
[SPEAKER_16]: I got to see Garbage and it was open for Alanis Morissette.

628
00:46:09,303 --> 00:46:10,384
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate you.

629
00:46:11,224 --> 00:46:13,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, all right, let's go to a break.

630
00:46:13,225 --> 00:46:14,306
[SPEAKER_07]: We definitely need a break here.

631
00:46:14,386 --> 00:46:18,649
[SPEAKER_07]: When we come back, more antics here on Orange Launch Radio, including some Bomani news.

632
00:46:18,669 --> 00:46:21,090
[SPEAKER_07]: There's actually been quite a bit in the past two weeks.

633
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:23,432
[SPEAKER_07]: So the thing that Mel hinted at earlier, we'll get to.

634
00:46:23,932 --> 00:46:27,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, Politary says something relevant.

635
00:46:27,654 --> 00:46:28,275
[SPEAKER_07]: It's amazing.

636
00:46:28,775 --> 00:46:30,576
[SPEAKER_07]: We will get to that in a little bit.

637
00:46:30,896 --> 00:46:31,497
[SPEAKER_07]: In this break...

638
00:46:32,771 --> 00:46:35,411
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to play Bomani songs with three-word titles.

639
00:46:36,192 --> 00:46:37,852
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted an excuse to play Temple of Love.

640
00:46:37,872 --> 00:46:38,692
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be back after this.

641
00:46:39,252 --> 00:46:40,032
[SPEAKER_07]: More Orange Lounge Radio.

642
00:47:29,802 --> 00:47:42,579
[SPEAKER_01]: is all the power, helping you through the midnight hour, the secret of love and peace, soul and heart it will release, so, for your head and pray, it's gonna take you, be awake, flying like a snow dove, out, to the temple of love.

643
00:49:46,694 --> 00:49:48,895
Turn around, look at what you see

644
00:50:21,517 --> 00:50:22,693
All of the phages

645
00:51:21,618 --> 00:51:26,402
[SPEAKER_24]: Follow the sound, follow the sound, leaving the rain behind.

646
00:51:27,082 --> 00:51:32,306
[SPEAKER_22]: Together we'll be in harmony, taking the time we will find out.

647
00:52:58,729 --> 00:53:07,891
[SPEAKER_24]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 139, the last episode of Orange Lounge Radio from our current studio.

648
00:53:08,031 --> 00:53:10,531
[SPEAKER_24]: This DDR sucks pants!

649
00:53:24,875 --> 00:53:26,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Let the joke die.

650
00:53:26,918 --> 00:53:28,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Step away from the joke.

651
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:34,088
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, if Deathgate could live into Final Fantasy XI this long, I can have pants joy.

652
00:53:34,869 --> 00:53:35,230
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

653
00:53:36,147 --> 00:53:43,391
[SPEAKER_07]: I remembered something during How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day I wanted to talk about that I didn't get a chance to because I got sidetracked by pants.

654
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:48,454
[SPEAKER_07]: I went to an antique store yesterday with my mom because my mom loves shopping for antiques.

655
00:53:49,194 --> 00:53:49,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Go figure.

656
00:53:50,555 --> 00:53:57,279
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was looking around and I actually saw these antique cactus jars and when I looked at them...

657
00:53:57,899 --> 00:53:59,301
[SPEAKER_07]: I could only think of one thing.

658
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,742
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought of DDR.

659
00:54:01,002 --> 00:54:07,409
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to post this link in the chat room there, so you guys can pull up that picture yourself if you want to look, because I took that picture on my cell phone.

660
00:54:07,789 --> 00:54:12,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, when you look at this, does anyone else think Gomlanda Couple right here?

661
00:54:14,476 --> 00:54:17,399
[SPEAKER_07]: This whole set, you want to know how much they wanted for this three-piece set?

662
00:54:17,419 --> 00:54:17,399
$55.

663
00:54:17,439 --> 00:54:18,940
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted it, though.

664
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:27,912
[SPEAKER_07]: I was thinking about it, just to have that sad little Gumball and the Couple joke.

665
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:28,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Wouldn't that have been funny?

666
00:54:30,034 --> 00:54:30,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

667
00:54:33,916 --> 00:54:34,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

668
00:54:35,097 --> 00:54:38,699
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to open up our Skype line in a little bit, but first I want to talk about some DDR news going on right now.

669
00:54:39,219 --> 00:54:44,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you know, boys and girls, that there is a brand new DDR game coming out?

670
00:54:46,267 --> 00:54:49,149
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably something you'll never ever ever be able to afford.

671
00:54:49,589 --> 00:54:52,771
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually a DDR fitness game.

672
00:54:53,071 --> 00:54:58,615
[SPEAKER_07]: So Mel, if you don't mind, I'm sorry, you're having a psych conversation there, I'm totally interrupting.

673
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:02,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell us a little more about the DDR fitness project.

674
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:03,298
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going on here?

675
00:55:03,478 --> 00:55:07,680
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, well just to give a quick background on how it all came about and such.

676
00:55:08,361 --> 00:55:15,105
[SPEAKER_27]: There was a convention about two or three weeks ago called the URSA, which is like the International Health Racquetball Conference.

677
00:55:15,435 --> 00:55:39,689
[SPEAKER_27]: Sports Association, I know there's like an international racquetball association out there but that said they have like an expo every year and it usually showcases a lot of stuff in fitness so there's often a lot of like fitness equipment like treadmills, exercise machines, they have a lot of people like GNC they go out there and they promote their vitamins that kind of stuff so basically the whole thing is a bunch of people running around in spandex that's what the convention is.

678
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:44,415
[SPEAKER_27]: No, but see, the thing is, you might think that's bad, but you're thinking, you know, from an anime con standpoint.

679
00:55:44,575 --> 00:55:47,279
[SPEAKER_27]: These people work out and take care of themselves.

680
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:48,761
[SPEAKER_27]: It's not a bad thing.

681
00:55:48,961 --> 00:55:49,922
[SPEAKER_15]: Send in more Manfei.

682
00:55:52,005 --> 00:55:52,446
[SPEAKER_27]: Essentially.

683
00:55:52,706 --> 00:55:54,889
[SPEAKER_27]: But Konami actually had a booth there.

684
00:55:55,780 --> 00:56:00,083
[SPEAKER_27]: And Konami's booth was actually Konami Tokyo's sports division.

685
00:56:00,644 --> 00:56:05,707
[SPEAKER_27]: And they actually do stuff like tread, they actually, Konami does a sports line of equipment.

686
00:56:05,727 --> 00:56:08,489
[SPEAKER_27]: They do treadmills, they do like weight machine stuff.

687
00:56:08,549 --> 00:56:10,350
[SPEAKER_27]: It's actually kind of neat just, you know, shortly.

688
00:56:10,731 --> 00:56:12,172
[SPEAKER_27]: They do stuff that's like computerized.

689
00:56:12,192 --> 00:56:18,116
[SPEAKER_27]: So like if you have a treadmill, you can actually like have a screen in front of you where you can like surf the web, you can like watch satellite TV.

690
00:56:18,596 --> 00:56:30,943
[SPEAKER_27]: There's really neat things that it actually has a computer chip that you wear around your wrist where you can go around like all bunch of different machines in one gym and it'll actually track how many calories you've been burning along the way with all the different machines.

691
00:56:31,284 --> 00:56:32,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Konami does a lot more than people think.

692
00:56:32,985 --> 00:56:35,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Konami is not just about, you know, DDR and Castlevania.

693
00:56:35,466 --> 00:56:36,967
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot more to Konami.

694
00:56:36,987 --> 00:56:45,992
[SPEAKER_07]: They actually, and when I go to the casino, I always see slot machines that were done by Konami and that just trips me out because I always think of Konami as, oh, you know, DDR and Gradius, right?

695
00:56:46,373 --> 00:56:46,493
[SPEAKER_07]: But...

696
00:56:47,823 --> 00:57:16,581
[SPEAKER_27]: Konami does a lot more than people think sometimes so yeah sports is like their big thing over in Japan and well getting more towards relevant stuff I guess they were actually showcasing something called DDR Studio which is basically sort of like what DDR could be in a fitness club type atmosphere obviously there are limitations with a home console whereas like Xbox you can only play up to four people you know well what if like you want to have a whole bunch of people going out there

697
00:57:17,113 --> 00:57:44,866
[SPEAKER_27]: so there's this program that they showed and how it worked was you have like wireless pads and you can play up to like eight players you know on this demo and what it is is you have like one instructor up front kind of like in any other aerobics class they'd be giving you like showing off the routine so there would be a game of DDR going but more so instead of paying attention to the screen and looking at the arrows and you know timing your steps like we all do just because we're

698
00:57:45,734 --> 00:58:13,861
[SPEAKER_27]: like all conditioned for DDR they actually take you through a routine which is almost like for all intents and purposes it's like freestyle only they're teaching it to you along the way and they do all different types of programs with it's really neat they do stuff like stretching programs like there's one that's like yoga tai chi type stuff where you go into like different poses and you hold freezes and such and then they do stuff that's a little more advanced like you do like a Muay Thai kickboxing type thing so in a way it's almost sort of like martial beat only like a lot less weird

699
00:58:14,941 --> 00:58:16,482
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought that was interesting.

700
00:58:17,002 --> 00:58:22,866
[SPEAKER_07]: The story that you posted over on DDR Freak kind of talks about a little, and if people want to see the story, of course, head on over to DDRFreak.com.

701
00:58:22,886 --> 00:58:24,226
[SPEAKER_07]: They have more information there.

702
00:58:24,266 --> 00:58:25,247
[SPEAKER_07]: It's their top story right now.

703
00:58:26,548 --> 00:58:30,810
[SPEAKER_07]: It talks about that there's actually additional symbols, like there's stars and stuff that are used.

704
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:40,076
[SPEAKER_27]: In addition, the way the graphic interface is set up is you basically have the step gauge in the center of the screen and onto the sides of it.

705
00:58:40,457 --> 00:58:48,743
[SPEAKER_27]: They have players one through eight, one through the odds on one side, the evens on the other, and it tracks how many calories you burn, just like in workout mode in DDR.

706
00:58:49,703 --> 00:58:51,445
[SPEAKER_27]: On top of that, what it does is...

707
00:58:52,677 --> 00:58:58,219
[SPEAKER_27]: The additional symbols you have is a fist that you see coming up, and the fist will either say LOR.

708
00:58:58,619 --> 00:59:03,560
[SPEAKER_27]: So when that comes up to the step gauge, that's your, the step zone, that's your cue to throw a left punch or a right punch.

709
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,761
[SPEAKER_27]: It's variant, of course, obviously by the routine.

710
00:59:05,781 --> 00:59:07,781
[SPEAKER_27]: Sometimes there'll be a jab, sometimes there'll be an uppercut.

711
00:59:08,101 --> 00:59:11,362
[SPEAKER_27]: It's dictated by the actual workout routine itself.

712
00:59:11,622 --> 00:59:16,384
[SPEAKER_27]: And then there's one that's a star that tells you, prompts you to do a kicking type motion.

713
00:59:16,684 --> 00:59:20,125
[SPEAKER_27]: So it could either be like a knee thrust or it could be like a forward lunge kick or a side kick.

714
00:59:21,775 --> 00:59:27,917
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really trying to take this DDR being a fitness thing and taking it one step further, really.

715
00:59:28,717 --> 00:59:29,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Ninjas!

716
00:59:29,678 --> 00:59:31,278
[SPEAKER_03]: They're creating ninjas, people!

717
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:32,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you see?

718
00:59:32,759 --> 00:59:33,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Ninjas!

719
00:59:33,459 --> 00:59:35,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Kicking and punching, what more do we need?

720
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:35,740
[SPEAKER_03]: They're ninjas!

721
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:43,182
[SPEAKER_07]: 24-hour ninjas coming soon to a 24-hour fitness near you.

722
00:59:44,063 --> 00:59:46,743
[SPEAKER_27]: Wow, that's like eight times three ninjas to movie, man.

723
00:59:49,604 --> 00:59:50,105
[SPEAKER_27]: Wow, wow.

724
00:59:52,289 --> 00:59:56,732
[SPEAKER_27]: No, but I mean, I guess a lot of people, I mean, that's the basic premise of it.

725
00:59:56,992 --> 01:00:08,600
[SPEAKER_27]: The cool thing I noticed about like the hardware is, you know, I said they're using wireless pads, but the pads that you see out there aren't really like the consumer ones you see, which are like kind of, you know, the vinyl over and then that, you know, the foldable soft pads.

726
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:11,422
[SPEAKER_27]: They actually use a somewhat semi-hard pad.

727
01:00:11,742 --> 01:00:16,365
[SPEAKER_27]: What it is, it's sort of like they use a hard rubber, which is kind of like what they use in car floor mats.

728
01:00:16,905 --> 01:00:19,547
[SPEAKER_27]: So it's pretty rubbery and it's very durable actually.

729
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:26,765
[SPEAKER_27]: and I don't think they, they said that it wasn't necessarily wireless, it was more like a Bluetooth type infrared type technology that they used.

730
01:00:27,366 --> 01:00:29,427
[SPEAKER_27]: So, I mean, that was just another tidbit of that.

731
01:00:30,808 --> 01:00:35,612
[SPEAKER_27]: And they actually work with PS2s, so if there was a way I could ever actually get my hands on that, I'd so be there.

732
01:00:38,359 --> 01:00:46,505
[SPEAKER_27]: But the thing about, I guess, what a lot of people are commenting is, you know, a lot of people, especially in the just online community, are saying like, great, where's our arcade mix?

733
01:00:46,786 --> 01:00:47,826
[SPEAKER_27]: Boohoo, no one cares.

734
01:00:47,866 --> 01:00:49,127
[SPEAKER_27]: You're like, this is fitness.

735
01:00:49,267 --> 01:00:50,528
[SPEAKER_27]: The last thing we need to see is this.

736
01:00:50,569 --> 01:01:01,417
[SPEAKER_27]: It's like, the way I see it right now, if Konami's arcade division does not want to go in the route of, you know, Dance Dance Revolution, and obviously they don't want to do something in America, this is their only alternate route.

737
01:01:01,457 --> 01:01:06,581
[SPEAKER_27]: Because if they keep targeting the same gamers, you know, like on the consumer level,

738
01:01:07,233 --> 01:01:09,074
[SPEAKER_27]: I do think Loki's got a comment.

739
01:01:09,114 --> 01:01:12,296
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's hope to God that they have these pads at E3 instead of the crappy soft pads.

740
01:01:27,012 --> 01:01:27,973
[SPEAKER_27]: All mentioned at the Jason.

741
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,481
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

742
01:01:59,164 --> 01:02:04,849
[SPEAKER_16]: By bringing it into a gym, it kind of legitimizes it a little bit versus that crazy game that all the gamers play.

743
01:02:04,889 --> 01:02:09,793
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like, oh, hey, it's something that other people who may not play games for any other reason can go and do.

744
01:02:10,053 --> 01:02:17,699
[SPEAKER_16]: So it kind of makes it less of a bastard stepchild in a way and brings it back into the forefront and can definitely bring some new people into it.

745
01:02:19,601 --> 01:02:22,263
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, they're going for the right target audience right now.

746
01:02:22,944 --> 01:02:25,926
[SPEAKER_27]: Like I said, you're going for a whole new audience, bringing them into DDR.

747
01:02:25,946 --> 01:02:28,088
[SPEAKER_27]: You're bringing people who are fitness goers because, like,

748
01:02:28,459 --> 01:02:28,819
[SPEAKER_27]: DarkSakura.com

749
01:02:54,276 --> 01:02:59,278
[SPEAKER_07]: That doesn't have children, you probably have never heard of DDR, honestly.

750
01:02:59,578 --> 01:03:06,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Because either your kids showed you what DDR was, or you're a gamer adult, like most of us are here, and you found DDR on your own.

751
01:03:06,361 --> 01:03:10,763
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you're a non-gamer adult, I can totally see how you've never heard of DDR, honestly.

752
01:03:11,063 --> 01:03:14,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially if you're a gym bunny, and you don't have time to go to the arcades.

753
01:03:15,145 --> 01:03:15,985
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it makes sense.

754
01:03:16,365 --> 01:03:16,905
[SPEAKER_15]: No comment.

755
01:03:20,219 --> 01:03:23,060
[SPEAKER_27]: But DDR50 Studio, it's actually a pretty fun game.

756
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:24,400
[SPEAKER_27]: I actually got to try it out myself.

757
01:03:25,261 --> 01:03:31,443
[SPEAKER_27]: When you go through a whole DDR studio, like the demo that they did, it was about like 25 minutes straight of DDR, of like working out.

758
01:03:32,003 --> 01:03:40,105
[SPEAKER_27]: And it was a lot of, it was pretty hectic and nothing says like strenuous like boxing the Kakumei.

759
01:03:43,246 --> 01:03:44,087
[SPEAKER_07]: I gotta see this.

760
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:46,707
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really curious if anybody in this area is gonna get it.

761
01:03:46,727 --> 01:03:47,568
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanna see it.

762
01:03:47,688 --> 01:03:48,708
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds kinda neat.

763
01:03:49,472 --> 01:03:50,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we expect to see pictures?

764
01:03:50,653 --> 01:03:52,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they going to do a website for it or anything?

765
01:03:52,133 --> 01:03:52,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Any promos?

766
01:03:52,413 --> 01:03:53,954
[SPEAKER_07]: What songs do they have on there?

767
01:03:53,994 --> 01:04:01,116
[SPEAKER_27]: A lot of songs I noticed were from, like, there were actually, I think most of them I caught were, like, from Beatmania type of songs.

768
01:04:01,756 --> 01:04:05,698
[SPEAKER_27]: But, like, the one I definitely remembered was, um, was all Kakumei.

769
01:04:05,738 --> 01:04:10,519
[SPEAKER_27]: I think one was, like, something from, I think it was Beatmania 6th, actually.

770
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:13,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, are there songs in this that have not been in DDR yet?

771
01:04:14,321 --> 01:04:17,682
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, yeah, there are some that are, like, yeah, pretty, like, just new, new.

772
01:04:17,942 --> 01:04:18,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh.

773
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:35,489
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm trying to get a bunch of stuff from Jason about it, but the thing is, it's like, you know, Konami's not going to be willing to give us any video footage, so I'm just trying to get either a press release or just get some stills, because I know they were doing stills that day, and I would have brought my DigiCam, but...

774
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:37,991
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, I wasn't able to get it.

775
01:04:38,071 --> 01:04:39,232
[SPEAKER_07]: That's very surprising.

776
01:04:39,332 --> 01:04:45,556
[SPEAKER_07]: I just assumed that they had taken, like, Max 2 and converted it for this with all those same songs.

777
01:04:45,596 --> 01:04:46,577
[SPEAKER_07]: That's very surprising that there's new stuff.

778
01:04:46,597 --> 01:04:49,538
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering if there will be a home release at some point of something like this.

779
01:04:49,859 --> 01:04:52,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, you're going to get people who are like, hey, this is kind of fun.

780
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:54,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hey, I can do this at home, too.

781
01:04:54,762 --> 01:04:55,022
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?

782
01:04:56,162 --> 01:04:57,623
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure that's the direction they want to go.

783
01:04:57,643 --> 01:05:00,205
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be a pretty smart marketing round, definitely.

784
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:07,845
[SPEAKER_16]: The other interesting thing to see on that line would be if they make it like, you know how they have those Atari things where you just plug in a joystick and it's like all the old school Atari games?

785
01:05:08,205 --> 01:05:14,449
[SPEAKER_16]: Because adults who aren't gamers don't have any other reason to get a PlayStation or Xbox, and that just makes the system a heck of a lot more expensive.

786
01:05:14,809 --> 01:05:18,472
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe just like some sort of standalone thing where you plug it in and plug the pad in and you're ready to go.

787
01:05:18,663 --> 01:05:19,784
[SPEAKER_07]: That's actually a really smart idea.

788
01:05:20,644 --> 01:05:21,945
[SPEAKER_07]: You've seen those DDR.

789
01:05:21,985 --> 01:05:22,905
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see these at the mall.

790
01:05:23,165 --> 01:05:24,246
[SPEAKER_07]: They suck.

791
01:05:24,286 --> 01:05:25,506
[SPEAKER_07]: They're shitty little things.

792
01:05:25,826 --> 01:05:29,628
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like MIDI songs.

793
01:05:30,649 --> 01:05:31,069
[SPEAKER_27]: They're horrible.

794
01:05:31,089 --> 01:05:32,530
[SPEAKER_36]: My sister bought that for my nephew.

795
01:05:33,470 --> 01:05:35,891
[SPEAKER_27]: Wasn't the one that has Survivor by Destiny's Child?

796
01:05:35,911 --> 01:05:37,892
[SPEAKER_27]: That was basically it, yes.

797
01:05:37,992 --> 01:05:40,213
[SPEAKER_27]: It's basically playing DDR on the Game Boy.

798
01:05:51,513 --> 01:06:03,437
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, it'll be interesting to see what develops with this.

799
01:06:03,697 --> 01:06:11,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you've got me all interested with that song list because it makes me think, hmm, could the songs they're using in this be something we see in the next home release?

800
01:06:12,297 --> 01:06:13,558
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know.

801
01:06:13,938 --> 01:06:17,261
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll keep talking to the contacts and get what I can.

802
01:06:17,621 --> 01:06:18,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds good.

803
01:06:18,342 --> 01:06:22,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Does this have an official name yet?

804
01:06:22,485 --> 01:06:23,465
[SPEAKER_27]: It's called DDR Studio.

805
01:06:23,505 --> 01:06:25,086
[SPEAKER_27]: Basically, it's out in Japan.

806
01:06:25,467 --> 01:06:30,550
[SPEAKER_27]: Right now, it's patent pending in America right now because essentially that's what we were doing at the convention.

807
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:36,234
[SPEAKER_27]: We were pitching the idea to a bunch of people who were managers of fitness clubs and such.

808
01:06:36,815 --> 01:06:40,998
[SPEAKER_27]: Essentially, if they garner enough interest, then it's something they'll move forward with.

809
01:06:41,587 --> 01:06:48,048
[SPEAKER_27]: So it's strictly conceptual on this side of the world, but it's very much reality elsewhere.

810
01:06:49,729 --> 01:06:53,430
[SPEAKER_36]: You know, if this does show up at my local gym, I am definitely going a lot more.

811
01:06:53,970 --> 01:06:54,510
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, hell yeah.

812
01:06:55,630 --> 01:06:57,831
[SPEAKER_07]: I would go much more as well, so it'd be interesting.

813
01:07:00,071 --> 01:07:02,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Might be motivation for me to get my fat ass up and exercise.

814
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:05,532
[SPEAKER_07]: And Loki, good excuse for you to ruin more pants.

815
01:07:08,490 --> 01:07:09,891
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell is going on here?

816
01:07:10,171 --> 01:07:12,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Jonas just showed up and he brought a PSP as well.

817
01:07:12,732 --> 01:07:13,592
[SPEAKER_14]: And he brought us dinner.

818
01:07:13,712 --> 01:07:16,913
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only because he came last week when we were doing the show.

819
01:07:16,973 --> 01:07:18,594
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's kind of sad.

820
01:07:18,854 --> 01:07:22,355
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't you feel like the odd child left out that doesn't have a PSP?

821
01:07:22,475 --> 01:07:23,295
[SPEAKER_16]: You're so not cool.

822
01:07:23,315 --> 01:07:23,735
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.

823
01:07:23,895 --> 01:07:25,156
[SPEAKER_07]: I am not cool, actually.

824
01:07:26,105 --> 01:07:29,727
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to open up the Skype line in a little bit, but first a couple of quick things.

825
01:07:30,668 --> 01:07:39,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Shark Scroll, I actually, speaking of PSP, you have an interesting story about how the PSP can sometimes take your place.

826
01:07:40,654 --> 01:07:43,115
[SPEAKER_16]: The PSP, the DS, anything?

827
01:07:44,096 --> 01:07:45,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you want to talk about, you don't have to talk about this.

828
01:07:45,757 --> 01:07:47,057
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we want to have the story now?

829
01:07:47,137 --> 01:07:47,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, have the story now.

830
01:07:48,238 --> 01:07:50,859
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so I have a friend.

831
01:07:50,899 --> 01:07:51,640
[SPEAKER_16]: What are you doing?

832
01:07:52,984 --> 01:07:54,444
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta stop you for real quick here.

833
01:07:54,704 --> 01:07:59,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Jonas just walked in with a lovin' lamb and a ball gag.

834
01:08:01,145 --> 01:08:03,886
[SPEAKER_03]: An inflatable sex lamb and a ball gag.

835
01:08:03,946 --> 01:08:05,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Jonas, Jonas, hi Jonas.

836
01:08:06,006 --> 01:08:08,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Jonas, come here, come here, get on the mic, Jonas.

837
01:08:10,007 --> 01:08:17,308
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, Sharks girl, but when inflatable lambs and ball gags are brought into play, I don't give a shit about your PSP story anymore.

838
01:08:17,328 --> 01:08:18,228
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you'll understand.

839
01:08:18,949 --> 01:08:20,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, love ya.

840
01:08:22,816 --> 01:08:29,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Jonas, now, remind me, you went 40 days with no boner for Lent, right?

841
01:08:29,317 --> 01:08:29,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

842
01:08:29,717 --> 01:08:36,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, how do you go from no boner for 40 days to bringing... Yes, I survived.

843
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:44,680
[SPEAKER_24]: How do you go from the... Islanders just finding this out for the first time.

844
01:08:45,721 --> 01:08:51,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Jonas, how do you go from being Mr. No Boner, for lack of a better term,

845
01:08:53,112 --> 01:09:01,496
[SPEAKER_07]: to bringing to this show, which has nothing to do with sex last time I checked, an inflatable lamb and a ball gag.

846
01:09:02,310 --> 01:09:02,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Please explain.

847
01:09:03,351 --> 01:09:03,851
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

848
01:09:04,271 --> 01:09:06,172
[SPEAKER_28]: For those who don't notice, I just turned 22 yesterday.

849
01:09:06,192 --> 01:09:06,792
[SPEAKER_28]: Happy birthday!

850
01:09:09,654 --> 01:09:14,337
[SPEAKER_28]: And a lot of people gave me some sex stuff, so... So why did you bring it here?

851
01:09:14,717 --> 01:09:17,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you think that we... Did you think... Oh, God!

852
01:09:17,778 --> 01:09:20,220
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's the last episode of Orange Lounge in that studio.

853
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:21,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's all fuck a sheep!

854
01:09:21,781 --> 01:09:22,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do it!

855
01:09:30,638 --> 01:09:31,238
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

856
01:09:31,338 --> 01:09:34,760
[SPEAKER_06]: If DarkSakura gets too angsty tonight, we'll just shove this ball in her mouth.

857
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:36,481
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

858
01:09:36,761 --> 01:09:37,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck that.

859
01:09:44,665 --> 01:09:47,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Jonas, I don't know what to do with you sometimes.

860
01:09:48,527 --> 01:09:50,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyway, back to Sharks Girl.

861
01:09:51,568 --> 01:09:52,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, please, back to Sharks Girl.

862
01:09:53,874 --> 01:09:55,895
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, Shark Skrull, but I had to go there.

863
01:09:55,915 --> 01:09:59,377
[SPEAKER_16]: And you know what's funny is that's just like so par for the course for this story.

864
01:10:00,857 --> 01:10:03,339
[SPEAKER_15]: Better than being hijacked by Loki's pants.

865
01:10:05,099 --> 01:10:09,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, please, your story about the DS, PSP, etc.

866
01:10:09,682 --> 01:10:13,944
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I have a friend who is not of any of the circles that anyone knows.

867
01:10:14,004 --> 01:10:14,544
[SPEAKER_16]: He moved away.

868
01:10:14,584 --> 01:10:15,064
[SPEAKER_16]: He moved back.

869
01:10:15,104 --> 01:10:15,504
[SPEAKER_16]: Long story.

870
01:10:15,584 --> 01:10:16,685
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, so...

871
01:10:17,287 --> 01:10:17,547
[SPEAKER_16]: Islander.

872
01:10:17,567 --> 01:10:17,747
[SPEAKER_16]: Harass.

873
01:10:49,172 --> 01:10:51,334
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, sorry.

874
01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:56,478
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, so I'm known for being a bit of the gadget junkie.

875
01:10:56,538 --> 01:10:59,080
[SPEAKER_16]: If it's cool and a new toy, I want it.

876
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:02,423
[SPEAKER_16]: So I have the iPod.

877
01:11:02,483 --> 01:11:04,785
[SPEAKER_16]: I almost ended up with a second iPod last weekend.

878
01:11:04,985 --> 01:11:05,785
[SPEAKER_16]: I have the PSP.

879
01:11:05,805 --> 01:11:06,306
[SPEAKER_16]: I have the DS.

880
01:11:06,326 --> 01:11:07,187
[SPEAKER_16]: I have all the fun little things.

881
01:11:07,407 --> 01:11:08,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Your Veruca game.

882
01:11:08,748 --> 01:11:10,369
[SPEAKER_06]: I want it, and I want it now, Daddy.

883
01:11:12,771 --> 01:11:13,672
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, pretty much.

884
01:11:14,052 --> 01:11:15,093
[SPEAKER_07]: She is a consumer whore.

885
01:11:15,113 --> 01:11:16,114
[SPEAKER_16]: And how.

886
01:11:16,294 --> 01:11:16,794
[SPEAKER_16]: And how.

887
01:11:16,834 --> 01:11:17,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, sorry.

888
01:11:17,294 --> 01:11:17,895
[SPEAKER_07]: I keep interrupting.

889
01:11:18,581 --> 01:11:24,183
[SPEAKER_16]: So I meet up with said friend and show him, oh, look, I got this nifty new Nintendo DS.

890
01:11:24,303 --> 01:11:28,225
[SPEAKER_16]: He has proceeded to yell at me if I don't bring the DS with me every time I see him now.

891
01:11:29,546 --> 01:11:33,167
[SPEAKER_16]: So then he told me not to get a PSP and I ignored him and got a PSP anyway.

892
01:11:34,288 --> 01:11:36,149
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I said, oh, look what I got a PSP.

893
01:11:36,329 --> 01:11:38,309
[SPEAKER_16]: And now all he wants to do is play the PSP.

894
01:11:38,389 --> 01:11:46,353
[SPEAKER_16]: So yes, my friends, I have gone from being seen for just, you know, my loving, charming self as an excuse to

895
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:48,141
[SPEAKER_16]: Get to play a DS and a PSP.

896
01:11:48,181 --> 01:11:49,502
[SPEAKER_16]: And he gets pissed off when I don't bring him.

897
01:11:49,562 --> 01:11:54,487
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I've decided to screw that, especially when he destroyed two of my games, I found out, when I tried to sell them.

898
01:11:54,647 --> 01:11:55,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoa.

899
01:11:55,628 --> 01:11:58,511
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I lent him two... What did I lend him?

900
01:11:58,551 --> 01:12:04,757
[SPEAKER_16]: Two PS2 games, and they were perfect, pristine, and now they're scratched to the point that the place won't buy them back.

901
01:12:05,597 --> 01:12:07,759
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I'm being used for video games.

902
01:12:07,799 --> 01:12:08,480
[SPEAKER_16]: Isn't that fun?

903
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:12,724
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not even rich, and I don't really have all the new stuff, but...

904
01:12:13,490 --> 01:12:14,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

905
01:12:39,435 --> 01:12:40,958
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, you show it to me and what do I do?

906
01:12:40,978 --> 01:12:42,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I already played that.

907
01:12:47,247 --> 01:12:50,152
[SPEAKER_16]: So yes, lesson of the story, don't use your friends for their video games.

908
01:12:50,192 --> 01:12:50,693
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not cool.

909
01:12:51,113 --> 01:12:51,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

910
01:12:53,116 --> 01:12:53,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, um...

911
01:12:55,359 --> 01:13:01,322
[SPEAKER_07]: We are going to open up the Skype line so you guys can call in because I'm sure you guys have plenty of comments here on this show going on so far.

912
01:13:02,142 --> 01:13:04,183
[SPEAKER_07]: But first, a couple quick announcements.

913
01:13:04,424 --> 01:13:09,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Today is the last day that you can vote for the Live365 Awards.

914
01:13:09,366 --> 01:13:18,190
[SPEAKER_07]: They are closing the polls at midnight, so please, please, please, please, if you haven't yet already, please head on over to Live365.com.

915
01:13:18,270 --> 01:13:21,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, head on over to OrangeLoungeRadio.com and right at the top...

916
01:13:21,992 --> 01:13:26,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Underneath the webcam, which by the way, the sun is starting to set here in Sacramento, as you can see on the webcam.

917
01:13:28,932 --> 01:13:35,456
[SPEAKER_07]: You can actually see right underneath the webcam, there's a little box that says, Thank you Live365 and Orange Lounge Radio listeners, a little logo.

918
01:13:36,036 --> 01:13:38,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Vote for us in the best of Live365 2005.

919
01:13:39,618 --> 01:13:52,245
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a link right there, www.live365.com slash broadcast slash bcawards.live Since you're listening to this station, you're already a registered Live365 member.

920
01:13:52,305 --> 01:13:55,227
[SPEAKER_07]: So, please, go to the website and vote.

921
01:13:55,567 --> 01:14:07,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I'm hearing a rumor that they're only counting VIP and other broadcasters, but from what I'm hearing, anybody can see the ballot, so I'm encouraging everybody to go vote.

922
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:12,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Even if they are not going to count your vote for whatever reason, at least show your support.

923
01:14:12,303 --> 01:14:15,525
[SPEAKER_07]: At least make them go, gosh, we have to throw out all these votes for Orange Lounge.

924
01:14:15,566 --> 01:14:17,147
[SPEAKER_07]: What a bunch of bastard people we must be.

925
01:14:19,249 --> 01:14:22,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's forget him again this year.

926
01:14:23,170 --> 01:14:24,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Should I play that little reminder there?

927
01:14:24,711 --> 01:14:26,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I just got booted from IRC.

928
01:14:26,211 --> 01:14:26,751
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not good.

929
01:14:28,252 --> 01:14:29,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Is the monitor stream still going?

930
01:14:29,612 --> 01:14:31,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

931
01:14:31,193 --> 01:14:35,274
[SPEAKER_03]: The router and cable modem is fine.

932
01:14:35,294 --> 01:14:38,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the internet's still up, but for whatever reason... And it's still setting.

933
01:14:38,935 --> 01:14:40,636
[SPEAKER_03]: The sun is still setting in Sacramento.

934
01:14:41,954 --> 01:14:47,459
[SPEAKER_07]: For whatever reason, we just got the boot from IRC, so we will make our way back into the chat room shortly here.

935
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:49,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, shoot, I was going to post that link in chat.

936
01:14:51,123 --> 01:14:52,304
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we'll get back in IRC.

937
01:14:52,684 --> 01:14:55,026
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess in the meantime, we could go ahead and open up the Skype line.

938
01:14:55,066 --> 01:14:55,627
[SPEAKER_07]: How's that sound?

939
01:14:56,748 --> 01:14:57,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Boy, oh boy.

940
01:14:58,269 --> 01:14:59,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's open up the Skype line.

941
01:15:00,811 --> 01:15:02,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember to call into our show.

942
01:15:02,652 --> 01:15:07,034
[SPEAKER_07]: All you have to do is head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com.

943
01:15:07,194 --> 01:15:12,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Click on Interact With Us, and you can download a little program called Skype that you can use to interact with us.

944
01:15:12,676 --> 01:15:17,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Please, guys, tonight, try to keep the calls kind of brief because we're expecting a lot of people want to get in tonight.

945
01:15:17,838 --> 01:15:19,358
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll start it off with our first caller.

946
01:15:19,378 --> 01:15:20,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

947
01:15:21,482 --> 01:15:22,403
[SPEAKER_07]: My Dennis Akum here.

948
01:15:22,803 --> 01:15:23,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, my friend.

949
01:15:23,384 --> 01:15:23,904
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind?

950
01:15:25,566 --> 01:15:26,166
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me see.

951
01:15:26,246 --> 01:15:29,849
[SPEAKER_12]: Just the comments and how, you know, DDR is taking a new path.

952
01:15:30,950 --> 01:15:37,115
[SPEAKER_12]: Just basically, instead of focusing on more of the gameplay, just focusing on the exercise.

953
01:15:37,336 --> 01:15:39,377
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a step in another direction.

954
01:15:39,678 --> 01:15:40,238
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.

955
01:15:40,278 --> 01:15:40,879
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I said.

956
01:15:40,959 --> 01:15:42,620
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of like another branch in the road.

957
01:15:43,161 --> 01:15:43,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

958
01:15:43,401 --> 01:15:43,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

959
01:15:44,381 --> 01:15:54,183
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, I mean, I still have hopes that they're going to make another arcade mix, but I don't expect that, you know, I'm not so fixated on the fact that it is.

960
01:15:54,844 --> 01:15:56,544
[SPEAKER_12]: But in reality, it might be possible.

961
01:15:58,024 --> 01:16:00,105
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm trying not to lose hope over it.

962
01:16:00,385 --> 01:16:01,505
[SPEAKER_12]: No, but think about it.

963
01:16:01,545 --> 01:16:05,106
[SPEAKER_12]: Logistically, it's possible because they could do it through a third party.

964
01:16:05,586 --> 01:16:10,007
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, as you know, Betson is their official distributor.

965
01:16:10,027 --> 01:16:10,427
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

966
01:16:10,447 --> 01:16:10,548
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

967
01:16:13,283 --> 01:16:20,847
[SPEAKER_12]: So if they ever wanted to make a mix in America and they needed to bring it out there, they could use them to distribute.

968
01:16:22,328 --> 01:16:23,469
[SPEAKER_07]: An idea.

969
01:16:23,669 --> 01:16:30,052
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we're not presidents of Konami Distribution or anything, so we would know, but you never know.

970
01:16:30,913 --> 01:16:31,813
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an option.

971
01:16:32,874 --> 01:16:42,539
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's right there in place because even though they shut down their American operations, they can still make the cabinets in Japan and ship them over here, assuming they have a distributor.

972
01:16:44,741 --> 01:17:05,738
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but you know, I'm just, you know, I don't know, I mean, this whole DDR Studio thing, yeah, it sounds promising, I just hope that, you know, it could just make DDR, you know, not something that would overkill the exposure, but just something that would make it known to almost the average Joe.

973
01:17:06,767 --> 01:17:09,691
[SPEAKER_12]: because Average Joe Sixpack won't even know what DDR makes.

974
01:17:09,711 --> 01:17:21,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, as you were saying earlier, you can't complain about DDR Studio because, of course, like what, the third reply in that thread was, fuck this game, we want new Konami arcade stuff.

975
01:17:21,244 --> 01:17:21,625
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't...

976
01:17:22,125 --> 01:17:24,286
[SPEAKER_14]: I want it in the green studio!

977
01:17:25,327 --> 01:17:26,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't even let me go there yet.

978
01:17:27,928 --> 01:17:32,851
[SPEAKER_07]: But any new DDR is going to be good for the scene as a whole because it's more exposure.

979
01:17:33,732 --> 01:17:34,933
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.

980
01:17:35,033 --> 01:17:37,734
[SPEAKER_12]: Konami's probably playing it both ways.

981
01:17:38,154 --> 01:17:49,161
[SPEAKER_12]: Trying to appease the scene that pretty much built DDR in this country and then trying to do their own thing by trying to branch out and focus on one aspect of DDR.

982
01:17:52,344 --> 01:17:54,005
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of like that.

983
01:17:54,025 --> 01:17:55,046
[SPEAKER_12]: They're playing both ways.

984
01:17:55,106 --> 01:17:59,290
[SPEAKER_12]: That's pretty much what Konami's doing.

985
01:17:59,450 --> 01:18:05,555
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't even know whether or not there's going to be another mix in the fall or something like that, or in the near future.

986
01:18:05,575 --> 01:18:10,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we do know that there is one thing that's going to be shown at E3 this year, for sure.

987
01:18:10,199 --> 01:18:13,742
[SPEAKER_07]: DDR with Mario is definitely going to be shown at E3.

988
01:18:13,862 --> 01:18:15,663
[SPEAKER_07]: IGN leaked that one earlier this week.

989
01:18:15,683 --> 01:18:16,524
[SPEAKER_07]: We know about that, so...

990
01:18:17,285 --> 01:18:20,288
[SPEAKER_12]: But what is Konami going to do to follow up Xtreme and Ultramix 2?

991
01:18:20,668 --> 01:18:21,108
[SPEAKER_12]: Tell me that.

992
01:18:21,188 --> 01:18:23,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the assumption is something is coming.

993
01:18:24,011 --> 01:18:33,140
[SPEAKER_12]: They can't just leave us hanging with that, but... They could, I don't know, I could just throw it out there and they probably could port Party Collection to this country and then basically, you know, shoot themselves in the foot.

994
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:34,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, nah, I... Because...

995
01:18:36,713 --> 01:18:40,938
[SPEAKER_07]: DDR Extreme was such a radical departure from DDR Extreme in Japan.

996
01:18:41,359 --> 01:18:43,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Wouldn't you logically think that we're going to get something brand new?

997
01:18:44,142 --> 01:18:45,303
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not going to port us something over?

998
01:18:45,323 --> 01:18:46,385
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to get something new?

999
01:18:47,706 --> 01:18:51,831
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't even know what the Japanese, whatever's left of the DDR scene over there...

1000
01:18:52,811 --> 01:18:59,317
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, the whole, whoever still plays there actually thinks of the new songs that were actually made for Ultramix, you know, and Ultramix 2.

1001
01:19:00,158 --> 01:19:07,564
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really hard to see what they think and how, you know, this is based, you know, on how Ultramix 2 and how we managed to make our own mix.

1002
01:19:07,984 --> 01:19:10,687
[SPEAKER_12]: Something that, you know, American DDR players could call their own.

1003
01:19:11,597 --> 01:19:12,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, I agree.

1004
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:16,860
[SPEAKER_07]: The recent US mixes have far surpassed their Japanese.

1005
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:23,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Song list arguments aside, I mean, Big Boo Hoo, Cartoon Heroes hasn't been released in the US now.

1006
01:19:24,644 --> 01:19:28,366
[SPEAKER_12]: The games themselves have surpassed Big Boo Hoo.

1007
01:19:29,166 --> 01:19:36,490
[SPEAKER_12]: What they lacked in popular songs from DDR Extreme, they made up for with brand new ones from 2DX and other Bomani.

1008
01:19:37,364 --> 01:19:47,133
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can't argue with that, that they're actually branching out into 2DX and really, you know, really, they're branching out into Bomani that these DDR players are most likely to play.

1009
01:19:47,293 --> 01:19:49,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, someone who's been on the inside wants to comment.

1010
01:19:49,375 --> 01:19:50,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on, hold on, Taku, hold on.

1011
01:19:51,851 --> 01:19:59,235
[SPEAKER_27]: I was just, I mean, I might be a minute or two behind, but I was hearing something about how, like, the US can break it out into their own as far as, like, DDR goes.

1012
01:19:59,676 --> 01:20:07,740
[SPEAKER_27]: I think that's what was the intention of when Konami of Hawaii was basically assigned to do Ultramix and basically the whole Xbox series.

1013
01:20:08,461 --> 01:20:10,362
[SPEAKER_27]: It's probably, I mean, the reason why I think Ultramix 2...

1014
01:20:11,175 --> 01:20:22,119
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, was the way it was, was because it was essentially, there was a lot of feedback from the American audience, from, you know, Right, hell, we even made the steps for the songs.

1015
01:20:22,499 --> 01:20:22,959
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's we?

1016
01:20:22,979 --> 01:20:25,920
[SPEAKER_12]: Yo, wait a minute, Saku, you didn't do it!

1017
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:35,043
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I mean, we as DDR players, I mean, you know, as a DDR player, Well, you know, if you're saying that, you know, someone like me represents everyone of you.

1018
01:20:35,223 --> 01:20:36,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Let the man finish, Saku, let the man finish.

1019
01:20:36,984 --> 01:20:37,784
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, you know, it's...

1020
01:20:38,955 --> 01:20:45,181
[SPEAKER_27]: It's something, but to say that's going to be the end of it, I don't think that's necessarily true.

1021
01:20:45,322 --> 01:20:50,427
[SPEAKER_27]: Obviously, we're not going to let you telegraph what we're doing six months down the road or whatever.

1022
01:20:50,867 --> 01:20:54,171
[SPEAKER_27]: In all fairness, I don't even work for the company anymore.

1023
01:20:54,291 --> 01:20:58,175
[SPEAKER_27]: But I just want to trip.

1024
01:20:58,235 --> 01:20:58,776
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, it's like...

1025
01:20:59,286 --> 01:21:07,535
[SPEAKER_27]: If you really want to basically have power as far as dictate what Konami does, buy 51% of their stock.

1026
01:21:07,555 --> 01:21:12,600
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't even know if that's available, but at $20 a pop, that's a lot, man.

1027
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:16,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Saku, we've got to let you go because other people are trying to get in, but thank you so much for calling.

1028
01:21:16,044 --> 01:21:16,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good one.

1029
01:21:18,695 --> 01:21:24,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so, you know, again, to sum that one up, any exposure for DDR is going to be a good thing.

1030
01:21:25,278 --> 01:21:25,998
[SPEAKER_07]: And the U.S.

1031
01:21:26,098 --> 01:21:34,101
[SPEAKER_07]: definitely breaking out into their own with Ultramix 2 and DDR Extreme being so radically different from its Japanese counterpart this year.

1032
01:21:34,141 --> 01:21:34,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's take another call.

1033
01:21:35,261 --> 01:21:36,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1034
01:21:37,202 --> 01:21:38,502
[SPEAKER_25]: Hey, Sky, it's Al Mullet.

1035
01:21:38,562 --> 01:21:39,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, Al Mullet.

1036
01:21:39,183 --> 01:21:39,763
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1037
01:21:41,843 --> 01:21:44,688
[SPEAKER_25]: This is one hell of a show you got going on right now.

1038
01:21:45,390 --> 01:21:52,405
[SPEAKER_07]: It's always these shows where we come in, and honestly, I'm going to be honest, like five minutes before the show started tonight, I was just going...

1039
01:21:53,337 --> 01:21:55,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's just get this over with.

1040
01:21:55,177 --> 01:21:56,158
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a headache.

1041
01:21:56,358 --> 01:21:58,858
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to get through this show so I can go back to bed.

1042
01:21:59,438 --> 01:22:05,740
[SPEAKER_07]: And now it's like, why is it whenever I approach the show with that attitude, the shows end up being just chaotic funness?

1043
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:09,100
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I'm glad you approach things with a bland attitude, Skye.

1044
01:22:09,140 --> 01:22:11,661
[SPEAKER_25]: It makes it greater for the rest of us.

1045
01:22:11,901 --> 01:22:17,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Aren't the rest of you so comfortable knowing that, you know, I approach this show with such a positive attitude?

1046
01:22:19,883 --> 01:22:20,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, let's do this again.

1047
01:22:20,843 --> 01:22:21,803
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, what's on your mind, Emily?

1048
01:22:22,828 --> 01:22:27,591
[SPEAKER_25]: I recently came into Beatmania 2DX 9th style and I've been having a ball with that.

1049
01:22:28,172 --> 01:22:30,353
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that's good to do to a machine, but okay.

1050
01:22:31,334 --> 01:22:32,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Just stop it, Loki.

1051
01:22:32,935 --> 01:22:33,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Just stop it.

1052
01:22:33,736 --> 01:22:35,557
[SPEAKER_25]: Loki, you already lost this show.

1053
01:22:35,657 --> 01:22:41,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't go for two.

1054
01:22:42,702 --> 01:22:43,463
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, Elmo.

1055
01:22:43,563 --> 01:22:45,144
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize for Loki's behavior.

1056
01:22:45,985 --> 01:22:46,545
[SPEAKER_25]: No, don't.

1057
01:22:46,585 --> 01:22:49,567
[SPEAKER_25]: At least I get to burn on him once before you go to your next studio.

1058
01:22:49,987 --> 01:22:50,908
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not dying.

1059
01:22:51,108 --> 01:22:52,129
[SPEAKER_07]: We are starting over.

1060
01:22:53,894 --> 01:22:54,454
[SPEAKER_00]: Good for you.

1061
01:22:54,494 --> 01:22:55,035
[SPEAKER_00]: It's new.

1062
01:22:55,795 --> 01:22:56,135
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1063
01:22:59,117 --> 01:22:59,397
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1064
01:22:59,657 --> 01:23:00,718
[SPEAKER_07]: So what else is on your mind now, Mullet?

1065
01:23:01,738 --> 01:23:02,539
[SPEAKER_07]: You got Nine Style.

1066
01:23:02,979 --> 01:23:08,842
[SPEAKER_25]: I got Nine Style, and I do have a PSP now, and I do have Luminous for it.

1067
01:23:09,582 --> 01:23:13,364
[SPEAKER_25]: And I do have a couple other games that are currently collecting dust.

1068
01:23:13,584 --> 01:23:19,768
[SPEAKER_16]: I would like to make a note that currently there are at least three or four PSPs in this room, and I think at least three of them are playing Luminous.

1069
01:23:21,489 --> 01:23:22,109
[SPEAKER_25]: As they should.

1070
01:23:24,797 --> 01:23:33,026
[SPEAKER_25]: It's the one game that I can honestly say is the only reason right now that a PSP should be bought right now.

1071
01:23:33,087 --> 01:23:40,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm kind of waiting for PopCap to rip it off like they do all the other puzzle games so that I can play Luminous online.

1072
01:23:40,975 --> 01:23:42,457
[SPEAKER_07]: But they'll probably call it, you know...

1073
01:23:43,328 --> 01:23:45,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Force or Magic Squares or, you know.

1074
01:23:46,412 --> 01:23:47,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Musical Squares.

1075
01:23:47,413 --> 01:23:49,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Musical Squares or something, you know.

1076
01:23:49,315 --> 01:23:53,420
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, PopCap.com, they rip off all the good puzzle games and make their own version.

1077
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:54,341
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm going to tell them that name.

1078
01:23:54,381 --> 01:23:57,946
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm going to go to PopCap and say, I have a title for your Luminous ripoff.

1079
01:23:58,326 --> 01:23:58,927
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1080
01:23:59,107 --> 01:23:59,848
[SPEAKER_25]: Give me money.

1081
01:24:01,149 --> 01:24:01,450
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1082
01:24:02,922 --> 01:24:07,085
[SPEAKER_07]: and we could call it Puzzle Pants as some folks in the chat room are... Oh boy.

1083
01:24:07,726 --> 01:24:07,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

1084
01:24:09,467 --> 01:24:13,511
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think about the whole DDR stuff at E3 this year?

1085
01:24:13,531 --> 01:24:14,431
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think we're going to see?

1086
01:24:14,491 --> 01:24:23,819
[SPEAKER_07]: We know that we're going to be seeing DDR with Mario per the earlier Orange Entree report that said IGN blew the lid on that and that we are going to see DDR with Mario at E3.

1087
01:24:24,139 --> 01:24:26,101
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think else is in store for us at E3?

1088
01:24:26,961 --> 01:24:29,964
[SPEAKER_25]: I think we're going to see PS2 and Xbox generations.

1089
01:24:30,405 --> 01:24:34,449
[SPEAKER_25]: We didn't know it was coming in 2002 when DDR Max was announced.

1090
01:24:34,509 --> 01:24:41,296
[SPEAKER_25]: We didn't know anything was coming in 2003 when Max 2... Well, we knew Max 2 was coming, but we didn't know Ultra Mix was coming.

1091
01:24:42,225 --> 01:24:46,468
[SPEAKER_25]: We didn't know Ultramix 2 was coming, even though we knew Extreme was coming in 2004.

1092
01:24:47,088 --> 01:24:50,530
[SPEAKER_25]: We don't know anything outside of DDR with Mario for right now.

1093
01:24:50,630 --> 01:24:53,432
[SPEAKER_25]: We can rest assured we're going to see some new iterations.

1094
01:24:53,512 --> 01:24:57,815
[SPEAKER_25]: I stake my career on it, as in quasi-internet celebrity.

1095
01:24:58,435 --> 01:24:59,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, okay.

1096
01:25:00,016 --> 01:25:00,916
[SPEAKER_25]: You heard it here first.

1097
01:25:01,897 --> 01:25:05,899
[SPEAKER_25]: If you don't see any new PS2 or Xbox games, I will retire forever.

1098
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:08,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, that's some strong words there.

1099
01:25:09,346 --> 01:25:11,687
[SPEAKER_07]: You better hope I lose this archive if that does turn out to be true.

1100
01:25:11,727 --> 01:25:12,868
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I am actually with you.

1101
01:25:13,248 --> 01:25:20,851
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to stake my internet celebrity on it because I don't have much to wager, but I do think we are going to see new PS2 and Xbox Mrs. I think it's inevitable.

1102
01:25:20,871 --> 01:25:24,633
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I don't have much to wager either, but there are people that want to see me retire, I'm sure.

1103
01:25:25,433 --> 01:25:27,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Your website, El Mullet.

1104
01:25:27,354 --> 01:25:28,695
[SPEAKER_25]: InsidePulse.com.

1105
01:25:29,555 --> 01:25:29,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Visit it.

1106
01:25:30,015 --> 01:25:30,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Love it.

1107
01:25:30,235 --> 01:25:31,456
[SPEAKER_07]: You haven't had a new column in a while.

1108
01:25:32,443 --> 01:25:33,103
[SPEAKER_25]: That's true.

1109
01:25:33,483 --> 01:25:34,704
[SPEAKER_25]: School's been getting in the way.

1110
01:25:34,744 --> 01:25:36,224
[SPEAKER_25]: I've been taking on some new duties.

1111
01:25:36,304 --> 01:25:44,087
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm the news editor now, which means I have full control over the news board, which is why our news board is so kick-ass right now.

1112
01:25:45,267 --> 01:25:48,388
[SPEAKER_25]: And I might be coming into some more... I've actually been working on a feature.

1113
01:25:49,228 --> 01:25:52,069
[SPEAKER_25]: And believe it or not, it's an In the Groove related feature.

1114
01:25:52,870 --> 01:25:53,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Shock!

1115
01:25:55,570 --> 01:26:00,252
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very curious to see what happens, because I know your feelings on In the Groove, and I'm just kind of...

1116
01:26:01,196 --> 01:26:08,981
[SPEAKER_25]: My feelings aside, this is more of a quasi-promotional piece, let's say, because I got an interview with someone in Red Octane.

1117
01:26:09,021 --> 01:26:11,642
[SPEAKER_25]: They were nice enough to answer some questions I had.

1118
01:26:12,943 --> 01:26:16,425
[SPEAKER_25]: And I'm doing an official ignition pad review.

1119
01:26:16,485 --> 01:26:24,449
[SPEAKER_25]: They were nice enough to supply me with a pad, considering that's going to be the basic controller they're offering for this game.

1120
01:26:24,789 --> 01:26:25,770
[SPEAKER_25]: So how does it hold up?

1121
01:26:27,098 --> 01:26:27,439
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

1122
01:26:27,479 --> 01:26:30,861
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have to check that out when the article comes out.

1123
01:26:30,901 --> 01:26:32,983
[SPEAKER_07]: So keep an eye on InsidePulse.com.

1124
01:26:33,403 --> 01:26:39,688
[SPEAKER_25]: It should be out sometime this week if everything goes well, everything's on time and such.

1125
01:26:39,888 --> 01:26:40,148
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1126
01:26:40,188 --> 01:26:42,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Mullen, I'm going to let you go so I can take another call, but thanks so much for calling in.

1127
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:43,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good one, okay?

1128
01:26:43,771 --> 01:26:44,191
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem.

1129
01:26:44,211 --> 01:26:44,491
[SPEAKER_07]: You too.

1130
01:26:44,611 --> 01:26:44,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Later.

1131
01:26:46,893 --> 01:26:47,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes?

1132
01:26:47,594 --> 01:26:52,397
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I always expect El Mullen to come in with a guitar strum like El Cabong's.

1133
01:26:52,617 --> 01:26:52,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.

1134
01:26:52,917 --> 01:26:54,899
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to go to another call here.

1135
01:26:54,939 --> 01:26:56,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1136
01:26:57,096 --> 01:26:57,817
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

1137
01:26:57,877 --> 01:26:59,218
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to check that out.

1138
01:26:59,538 --> 01:27:01,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, turn down your volume there.

1139
01:27:01,159 --> 01:27:04,522
[SPEAKER_07]: First rule of radio, turn down the volume because we're hearing ourselves there.

1140
01:27:05,663 --> 01:27:06,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

1141
01:27:06,964 --> 01:27:07,285

01:29:34,116 --> 01:29:35,496
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a couple of stories for you.

1210
01:29:36,257 --> 01:29:37,777
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I told Jamie this one.

1211
01:29:38,197 --> 01:29:40,438
[SPEAKER_02]: I call it the PSP to hell.

1212
01:29:43,459 --> 01:29:46,380
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened was a guy came to return on the PSP.

1213
01:29:47,901 --> 01:29:49,041
[SPEAKER_02]: This is brilliant.

1214
01:29:50,208 --> 01:29:50,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh oh.

1215
01:30:18,570 --> 01:30:21,451

01:30:25,813 --> 01:30:26,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Ouch.

1217
01:30:26,934 --> 01:30:29,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I've heard about a couple burnt out pixels or two.

1218
01:30:29,755 --> 01:30:30,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Stupid.

1219
01:30:31,496 --> 01:30:32,956
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

1220
01:30:33,076 --> 01:30:33,997
[SPEAKER_07]: So what ended up happening?

1221
01:30:34,857 --> 01:30:37,598
[SPEAKER_02]: General Manager told him, can I give you a refund now?

1222
01:30:37,778 --> 01:30:39,439
[SPEAKER_02]: And he took a swing at the General Manager.

1223
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:42,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I hope you had that boy escorted out.

1224
01:30:43,861 --> 01:30:44,701
[SPEAKER_02]: By the police, yeah.

1225
01:30:45,081 --> 01:30:45,722
[SPEAKER_24]: By the police.

1226
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:51,521
[SPEAKER_02]: But what happened was the general manager ducked and hit him right in the face and he went out.

1227
01:30:52,862 --> 01:30:53,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my gosh.

1228
01:30:54,502 --> 01:30:56,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Drama at a game store.

1229
01:30:56,303 --> 01:30:57,063
[SPEAKER_07]: What the heck?

1230
01:30:58,424 --> 01:31:03,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Best part is, the general manager was a six foot two tall girl.

1231
01:31:04,746 --> 01:31:05,846
[SPEAKER_02]: That is awesome.

1232
01:31:05,926 --> 01:31:06,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait a minute.

1233
01:31:06,566 --> 01:31:11,068
[SPEAKER_07]: So this guy went to take a swing at a girl over a PSP which he broke himself.

1234
01:31:11,648 --> 01:31:11,888
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1235
01:31:12,668 --> 01:31:14,229
[SPEAKER_15]: Stupid, stupid, stupid.

1236
01:31:14,329 --> 01:31:14,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh.

1237
01:31:17,199 --> 01:31:17,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

1238
01:31:17,959 --> 01:31:19,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Let us know when he's out of jail, okay?

1239
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:21,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, I'll be sure of that.

1240
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:26,321
[SPEAKER_07]: If we can get his picture, we'll post it on the website as our loser of the month.

1241
01:31:27,262 --> 01:31:27,862
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll try.

1242
01:31:28,202 --> 01:31:28,542

01:31:33,223 --> 01:31:33,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

1247
01:31:33,583 --> 01:31:35,644
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just watching a backlash of drama and shit.

1248
01:31:35,684 --> 01:31:36,604
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just leave it at that.

1249
01:31:37,244 --> 01:31:37,544

[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize to those of you guys not getting through tonight.

1278
01:33:23,972 --> 01:33:24,893

1279
01:33:25,653 --> 01:33:26,933
[SPEAKER_31]: It's my fault as well.

[SPEAKER_07]: You lucked out.

1282
01:33:31,095 --> 01:33:32,516
[SPEAKER_07]: The last guy didn't have his mic up.

1283
01:33:32,556 --> 01:33:34,116
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1284
01:33:34,637 --> 01:33:39,879
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, just helping you out with some Happy Sky song lists that are in Japanese.

1285
01:33:40,479 --> 01:33:40,799
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1286
01:33:41,283 --> 01:33:42,984
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm gonna tell it, you know, tell it to you.

1287
01:33:43,104 --> 01:33:43,865
[SPEAKER_31]: And here it is.

1288
01:33:44,085 --> 01:33:47,828
[SPEAKER_31]: The genre is disco, and the artist is a dance man featuring disco.

1289
01:33:48,229 --> 01:33:49,730
[SPEAKER_31]: And this is kind of a tongue twister.

1290
01:33:50,190 --> 01:33:53,212
[SPEAKER_31]: The tongue twister is, we are Disco Yotsutatsu Inochi.

1291
01:33:54,794 --> 01:33:55,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

1292
01:33:55,794 --> 01:33:56,615
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a mouthful there.

1293
01:33:56,995 --> 01:33:58,657
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, your mic is a little bit quiet.

1294
01:33:58,697 --> 01:34:00,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything you can do to make yourself louder would be appreciated by our listeners.

1295
01:34:01,719 --> 01:34:02,820
[SPEAKER_31]: Alright, now it's closer.

1296
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:03,320
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1297
01:34:05,217 --> 01:34:09,320
[SPEAKER_31]: I am beat mania, you are what mania?

1298
01:34:09,620 --> 01:34:12,543
[SPEAKER_31]: Ore is a masculine way of saying I. Huh.

1299
01:34:33,169 --> 01:34:34,931
[SPEAKER_06]: I am Beatmania, you are what mania?

1300
01:34:35,652 --> 01:34:36,573
[SPEAKER_06]: You are what mania?

1301
01:34:37,814 --> 01:34:41,158
[SPEAKER_16]: I am Beatmania, you are what?

1302
01:34:41,218 --> 01:34:41,799
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you didn't.

1303
01:34:42,359 --> 01:34:43,180
[SPEAKER_07]: I am Beatmania.

1304
01:34:44,161 --> 01:34:45,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, couldn't help myself.

1305
01:34:48,406 --> 01:34:53,351
[SPEAKER_31]: And then there's a hard dance, you know, which is a remix of Got Ticey or Strong Yega.

1306
01:34:54,192 --> 01:34:54,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, okay.

1307
01:34:56,141 --> 01:35:14,510
[SPEAKER_31]: and then there's, you know, and then a synthetic, oh, I forgot another, the genre is natural sound and it's by Twin Amadeus, Altaturka on Passion, you know, WN, I cannot pronounce it as UN, and it's very interesting that Altaturka on Passion is the remix of the Turkish March.

1308
01:35:15,548 --> 01:35:16,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

1309
01:35:16,128 --> 01:35:18,529
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, the twin armadillos version of the Turkish March.

1310
01:35:18,589 --> 01:35:20,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, that should be interesting, the old classic song.

1311
01:35:20,950 --> 01:35:23,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, you've been checking out some of the videos, right, from Happy Sky?

1312
01:35:23,911 --> 01:35:24,131
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah.

1313
01:35:24,231 --> 01:35:25,491
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I'm going to play a little clip.

1314
01:35:25,511 --> 01:35:29,873
[SPEAKER_07]: You actually sent me one of Eden, one of the new songs from 12th Cell.

1315
01:35:29,933 --> 01:35:31,913
[SPEAKER_31]: It's my very favorite Terra song.

1316
01:35:31,933 --> 01:35:37,175
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can hear a little bit there of what Eden sounds like, the new Terra song.

1317
01:35:41,797 --> 01:35:42,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of double notes in that.

1318
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:50,731
[SPEAKER_07]: What else can we look forward to in the Happy Sky videos?

1319
01:35:50,751 --> 01:35:53,712
[SPEAKER_07]: What else is in those videos that you think is worth sharing with our listeners?

1320
01:35:53,732 --> 01:35:55,492
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, you already saw ToeJam.

1321
01:35:55,732 --> 01:35:56,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I saw the ToeJam video.

1322
01:35:57,012 --> 01:35:57,633
[SPEAKER_07]: That was pretty cool.

1323
01:35:58,153 --> 01:35:59,693
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, I really like the song.

1324
01:35:59,733 --> 01:36:00,914
[SPEAKER_31]: It's the first time I ever heard it.

1325
01:36:01,794 --> 01:36:07,455
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, while I was listening to the song, I just yelled, Yeehaw!

1326
01:36:13,617 --> 01:36:14,938
[SPEAKER_07]: This is coming from the video there.

1327
01:36:14,958 --> 01:36:15,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

1328
01:36:17,088 --> 01:36:21,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, tempo changes like hell, but that's what you'd expect from ToeJam.

1329
01:36:21,950 --> 01:36:25,731
[SPEAKER_31]: It goes from 103 to 160 BPM.

1330
01:36:26,672 --> 01:36:30,013
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, the 160 BPM is the fastest.

1331
01:36:30,613 --> 01:36:30,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1332
01:36:31,574 --> 01:36:34,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else in the videos that looks pretty cool?

1333
01:36:34,135 --> 01:36:38,016
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, there's, whatchamacallit... Yeah, I didn't like the song, It's too plain.

1334
01:36:43,593 --> 01:36:46,415
[SPEAKER_07]: I noticed it looks like a lot of the videos have generics.

1335
01:36:46,575 --> 01:36:48,496
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hoping that changes before the final release.

1336
01:36:48,836 --> 01:36:52,718
[SPEAKER_31]: They will have actual videos when the final product's been released.

1337
01:36:53,198 --> 01:36:54,999
[SPEAKER_31]: Just like the same thing happened to Be Quiet.

1338
01:36:55,699 --> 01:36:56,339
[SPEAKER_07]: That's very true.

1339
01:36:56,359 --> 01:37:00,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1340
01:37:01,690 --> 01:37:05,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, we're going to go ahead and let you go because our Skype line is on fire tonight, but thanks for the 2DX update.

1341
01:37:06,011 --> 01:37:13,032
[SPEAKER_07]: And the borrowing of your Japanese accent is always appreciated as well from this very white host.

1342
01:37:13,872 --> 01:37:17,773
[SPEAKER_31]: And so, let me get my catchphrase first.

1343
01:37:18,273 --> 01:37:22,674
[SPEAKER_31]: And so this resident 2DX bastard walks back to the shadows of Bimani style.

1344
01:37:23,214 --> 01:37:23,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, my friend.

1345
01:37:24,054 --> 01:37:24,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good one.

1346
01:37:25,034 --> 01:37:25,694
[SPEAKER_31]: All right, later.

1347
01:37:27,014 --> 01:37:29,135
[SPEAKER_07]: I like our callers that have their own taglines.

1348
01:37:29,175 --> 01:37:29,735
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty funny.

1349
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:33,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, maybe we can squeeze in one more call.

1350
01:37:33,603 --> 01:37:34,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1351
01:37:38,347 --> 01:37:40,108
[SPEAKER_07]: It's this guy whose mic wasn't working earlier.

1352
01:37:40,148 --> 01:37:41,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you hear us, buddy?

1353
01:37:42,030 --> 01:37:42,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello?

1354
01:37:44,452 --> 01:37:45,233
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we still can't hear him.

1355
01:37:45,253 --> 01:37:46,033
[SPEAKER_07]: We still can't hear you.

1356
01:37:46,114 --> 01:37:47,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Turn your mic up or something.

1357
01:37:49,116 --> 01:37:50,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Give him a few more seconds.

1358
01:37:52,859 --> 01:37:53,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't!

1359
01:37:53,980 --> 01:37:54,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's try another call.

1360
01:37:56,122 --> 01:37:57,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1361
01:37:57,263 --> 01:37:57,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello?

1362
01:37:58,240 --> 01:37:59,841
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, it's me, it's LemonLimeJump.

1363
01:37:59,921 --> 01:38:01,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, LemonLimeJump, how are you?

1364
01:38:02,261 --> 01:38:04,902
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, I'm, uh, uh, yeah, I'm here.

1365
01:38:05,962 --> 01:38:07,423
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if there, is that better?

1366
01:38:07,823 --> 01:38:08,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we can hear you, what's up?

1367
01:38:09,123 --> 01:38:11,244
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, um, alright.

1368
01:38:12,044 --> 01:38:16,186
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to say, yeah, I don't know why, but for some reason I was up early enough yesterday.

1369
01:38:16,206 --> 01:38:16,506
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello?

1370
01:38:16,966 --> 01:38:17,566
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, we can hear you.

1371
01:38:18,406 --> 01:38:22,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay, um... We're just eagerly anticipating your every word.

1372
01:38:22,968 --> 01:38:23,828
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay, I'm just...

1373
01:38:24,386 --> 01:38:25,586
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to turn off the radio.

1374
01:38:25,767 --> 01:38:26,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

1375
01:38:26,147 --> 01:38:28,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, definitely turn down the radio because it'll throw you off there a little bit.

1376
01:38:29,148 --> 01:38:29,588
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got it.

1377
01:38:30,128 --> 01:38:30,528
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1378
01:38:32,809 --> 01:38:41,632
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was actually tuned into the Today Show yesterday, and I guess you probably heard they had that DDR thing on it yesterday.

1379
01:38:41,672 --> 01:38:43,413
[SPEAKER_11]: It was just like a little five-minute segment.

1380
01:38:43,593 --> 01:38:45,734
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I actually didn't hear about DDR on the Today Show.

1381
01:38:46,014 --> 01:38:46,474
[SPEAKER_07]: What happened?

1382
01:38:46,494 --> 01:38:53,677
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I guess they were touting it for its fitness qualities.

1383
01:38:54,468 --> 01:38:57,329
[SPEAKER_11]: They had some fitness expert come in and try to show it off.

1384
01:38:57,389 --> 01:39:02,750
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they had a couple of Cobalt Flux pads plugged into a PS2 or an Xbox or something.

1385
01:39:03,710 --> 01:39:14,672
[SPEAKER_11]: And the thing I found... Okay, one thing I found interesting was that the song that they used for demonstration was Mobile Moga.

1386
01:39:14,772 --> 01:39:18,012
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was thinking, Orange Lounge, Orange Lounge, where you going?

1387
01:39:18,132 --> 01:39:18,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's too cute.

1388
01:39:19,933 --> 01:39:20,193
[SPEAKER_11]: And then...

1389
01:39:21,829 --> 01:39:22,869
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, my brain works funny.

1390
01:39:23,029 --> 01:39:23,569
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know why.

1391
01:39:24,950 --> 01:39:25,790
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to interrupt real fast.

1392
01:39:25,810 --> 01:39:28,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Shark Skrull has got this funny look on her face.

1393
01:39:28,191 --> 01:39:29,011
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to share this.

1394
01:39:29,471 --> 01:39:31,292
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh my god, I think you're my voice twin.

1395
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:35,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Shark Skrull and Lemon Lime Jump do sound very similar.

1396
01:39:35,213 --> 01:39:35,933
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of scary.

1397
01:39:36,193 --> 01:39:38,073
[SPEAKER_11]: Same mannerisms, same voice, same everything.

1398
01:39:38,113 --> 01:39:38,654
[SPEAKER_11]: It's freaky.

1399
01:39:40,374 --> 01:39:42,055
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody says I sound like my sister, though.

1400
01:39:42,775 --> 01:39:46,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Except I don't... Well, now there's three of you.

1401
01:39:46,416 --> 01:39:48,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you've got a twin on the West Coast.

1402
01:39:48,856 --> 01:39:51,077
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, there's five, because my family sounds like me, too.

1403
01:39:51,878 --> 01:39:53,018
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow, that's crazy.

1404
01:39:53,119 --> 01:39:53,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

1405
01:39:53,999 --> 01:39:58,260
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, you were into another thought there before I let Sharks Girl cut you off there?

1406
01:39:59,081 --> 01:40:00,481
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

1407
01:40:01,302 --> 01:40:06,564
[SPEAKER_11]: But it was one thing that irritated me, and I guess, I don't know, because they needed something for the cameras to focus on.

1408
01:40:06,924 --> 01:40:11,966
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, they demonstrated for like 30 seconds trying to play, and then they had the two guys...

1409
01:40:13,482 --> 01:40:23,005
[SPEAKER_11]: Talking, and they still had the camera focused and they weren't even playing anymore, so it basically had the camera going boo, or the camera focused on the two TV screens going boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.

1410
01:40:23,305 --> 01:40:24,906
[SPEAKER_06]: You too can be a DDR expert!

1411
01:40:27,147 --> 01:40:30,628
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm thinking, what choice of camera shots was that?

1412
01:40:30,908 --> 01:40:31,648
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not quite sure.

1413
01:40:31,708 --> 01:40:33,049
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I say to that director?

1414
01:40:33,729 --> 01:40:34,129
[SPEAKER_11]: FIRED!

1415
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:38,811
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's a little, yeah.

1416
01:40:45,117 --> 01:40:48,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for the update because I had no idea that DDR was on the Today Show.

1417
01:40:48,259 --> 01:40:49,520
[SPEAKER_07]: I somehow completely missed that.

1418
01:40:49,580 --> 01:40:53,063
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish that somebody would send a little clip somehow so we could see that.

1419
01:40:54,033 --> 01:40:57,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, hopefully that somebody got that and we can check that out later.

1420
01:40:57,335 --> 01:41:03,139
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, if we can find a clip of the Today Show, we will do, in the great Orange Lounge tradition, we will play it and make fun of it.

1421
01:41:04,761 --> 01:41:05,741
[SPEAKER_11]: Drew Kucky?

1422
01:41:07,503 --> 01:41:10,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully not in the Today Show, but we'll see.

1423
01:41:10,204 --> 01:41:10,625
[SPEAKER_07]: You never know.

1424
01:41:11,165 --> 01:41:12,126
[SPEAKER_07]: They are desperate for ratings.

1425
01:41:12,746 --> 01:41:14,247
[SPEAKER_11]: It just made me think of, yeah, NBC.

1426
01:41:14,367 --> 01:41:15,828
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, I know.

1427
01:41:16,789 --> 01:41:19,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, this is, yeah, your last show in the studio.

1428
01:41:19,771 --> 01:41:23,114
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not quite sure how the broadcasting works, but...

1429
01:41:27,454 --> 01:41:35,960
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if I'd be broadcasting a show on my birthday, but I just want to say two days ahead of time, I want to say happy birthday to DarkSakura.

1430
01:41:36,501 --> 01:41:37,421
[SPEAKER_11]: We got the same birthday.

1431
01:41:38,382 --> 01:41:39,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you guys really?

1432
01:41:39,703 --> 01:41:40,844
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I looked it up.

1433
01:41:41,044 --> 01:41:45,607
[SPEAKER_07]: You and DarkSakura and LemonLimeJump have the same birthday, and she's saying happy birthday to you.

1434
01:41:45,627 --> 01:41:46,668
[SPEAKER_13]: Happy birthday to us!

1435
01:41:47,749 --> 01:41:50,170
[SPEAKER_13]: Because we are so freaking awesome.

1436
01:41:50,571 --> 01:41:51,091
[SPEAKER_13]: Happy birthday!

1437
01:41:54,383 --> 01:41:54,703
[SPEAKER_07]: You're on.

1438
01:41:54,803 --> 01:41:55,083
[SPEAKER_24]: Yay.

1439
01:41:55,183 --> 01:41:55,303
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh.

1440
01:41:55,944 --> 01:41:57,504
[SPEAKER_15]: From my left hand, I turned off the microphone.

1441
01:41:57,584 --> 01:41:57,744
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1442
01:41:58,584 --> 01:41:59,665
[SPEAKER_15]: Arigato.

1443
01:42:01,485 --> 01:42:02,025
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1444
01:42:02,105 --> 01:42:03,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you girls have a good birthday.

1445
01:42:03,666 --> 01:42:08,427
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm imagining DarkSakura is the lushier of the two of you, so you probably won't be drinking.

1446
01:42:09,028 --> 01:42:11,889
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be boozing like a... Are you a big drinker, LemonLimeJump?

1447
01:42:13,289 --> 01:42:13,829
[SPEAKER_11]: Not yet.

1448
01:42:13,949 --> 01:42:15,650
[SPEAKER_11]: Give me about three years and two days.

1449
01:42:16,070 --> 01:42:17,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, she's underage.

1450
01:42:18,251 --> 01:42:18,831
[SPEAKER_24]: My bad.

1451
01:42:18,851 --> 01:42:19,411
[SPEAKER_11]: She's underage.

1452
01:42:19,431 --> 01:42:22,152
[SPEAKER_11]: When you're 21, we're going to have to go hunt you down.

1453
01:42:22,572 --> 01:42:22,752
[SPEAKER_06]: I've...

1454
01:42:24,443 --> 01:42:25,204
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm good with it.

1455
01:42:25,584 --> 01:42:26,625
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got a good composure.

1456
01:42:26,725 --> 01:42:27,766
[SPEAKER_11]: This stuff doesn't bother me.

1457
01:42:28,927 --> 01:42:30,468
[SPEAKER_11]: You hear worse on cable TV anyway.

1458
01:42:30,488 --> 01:42:34,812
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, not the cursing, but like... Okay, never mind.

1459
01:42:34,832 --> 01:42:35,592
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just taking a bigger hold.

1460
01:42:35,632 --> 01:42:36,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, it's alright.

1461
01:42:36,273 --> 01:42:36,633
[SPEAKER_07]: It's alright.

1462
01:42:37,314 --> 01:42:42,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's all about Loki's pants.

1463
01:42:43,439 --> 01:42:49,303
[SPEAKER_11]: For a couple last words I wanted to say, I just wanted a few last words to say.

1464
01:42:49,704 --> 01:42:49,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.

1465
01:42:51,025 --> 01:42:51,305
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1466
01:42:51,325 --> 01:42:51,405
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1467
01:42:52,577 --> 01:43:06,921
[SPEAKER_11]: Legs, clothing, baggies, bell bottoms, bells, bermudas, bloomers, boxer shorts, breeches, beefs, britches, chaps, chinos, clam jiggers, cords, corduroys, zenims, drawers, stone grease, jeans, jodipers, knickers, longies, overalls, pantaloons, panties, pedal pushers, pegs, shorts, slacks, trousers, and underpants.

1468
01:43:07,442 --> 01:43:07,902
[SPEAKER_11]: And now you know.

1469
01:43:09,246 --> 01:43:09,767
[SPEAKER_06]: They're pants.

1470
01:43:11,828 --> 01:43:14,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Mel had a confused look on his face.

1471
01:43:14,771 --> 01:43:16,713
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got one of those looks like he's mid-eating.

1472
01:43:16,773 --> 01:43:18,314
[SPEAKER_07]: He's about to shove some cake in his mouth.

1473
01:43:18,715 --> 01:43:19,976
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he's like, huh?

1474
01:43:20,416 --> 01:43:21,617
[SPEAKER_07]: What is this chick saying?

1475
01:43:21,958 --> 01:43:23,039
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, it's pants, Mel.

1476
01:43:23,079 --> 01:43:23,419
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pants.

1477
01:43:24,180 --> 01:43:25,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for sharing.

1478
01:43:25,821 --> 01:43:28,083
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I'm done with pants for the night.

1479
01:43:28,404 --> 01:43:29,685
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening to you all.

1480
01:43:29,745 --> 01:43:30,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for calling in, hon.

1481
01:43:31,286 --> 01:43:31,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good one.

1482
01:43:33,869 --> 01:43:34,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Our listeners are so funny.

1483
01:43:36,138 --> 01:43:38,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we can let one more call sneak in here.

1484
01:43:38,479 --> 01:43:39,819
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm liking the sky plane tonight.

1485
01:43:39,839 --> 01:43:40,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody's getting in.

1486
01:43:42,379 --> 01:43:43,960
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll see if anybody else gets in.

1487
01:43:44,020 --> 01:43:49,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, one more time, please take a second, vote for our podcast.

1488
01:43:49,781 --> 01:43:51,381
[SPEAKER_07]: We would totally appreciate that.

1489
01:43:51,421 --> 01:43:53,121
[SPEAKER_07]: It's podcastalley.com.

1490
01:43:53,981 --> 01:43:55,482
[SPEAKER_07]: And then just do a search for Orange Lounge.

1491
01:43:55,562 --> 01:43:58,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Or better yet, I'll just post the link right there in the chat room and you guys can vote.

1492
01:43:58,922 --> 01:43:59,402
[SPEAKER_07]: How's that sound?

1493
01:43:59,723 --> 01:44:00,963
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's go ahead and take this call.

1494
01:44:01,483 --> 01:44:02,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1495
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:08,306
[SPEAKER_31]: Hey, what do you call a binary star system that distributes energy from one star into the other?

1496
01:44:08,826 --> 01:44:09,006
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1497
01:44:09,026 --> 01:44:09,426
[SPEAKER_31]: Algal.

1498
01:44:09,846 --> 01:44:11,767
[SPEAKER_31]: It's John Fields, your fan.

1499
01:44:12,227 --> 01:44:13,008
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind?

1500
01:44:13,988 --> 01:44:20,150
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, I was thinking about the upcoming E3, and, you know, it's been quite a while since we've been hit with an arcade release of DDR.

1501
01:44:21,011 --> 01:44:23,612
[SPEAKER_31]: So I'm wondering if they might actually spring that on us.

1502
01:44:24,352 --> 01:44:30,954
[SPEAKER_07]: So John thinks that a possible arcade release could be something that would be shown at E3.

1503
01:44:30,974 --> 01:44:31,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1504
01:44:33,476 --> 01:44:38,404
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have to say, unfortunately, it's very doubtful because E3 is typically a consumer electronic show.

1505
01:44:38,564 --> 01:44:43,972
[SPEAKER_07]: A new arcade mix would be something more for something like, what's the big arcade show they do in Vegas every year?

1506
01:44:44,313 --> 01:44:45,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Coin-Op, something?

1507
01:44:49,119 --> 01:44:51,760
[SPEAKER_07]: CES, Consumer Electronics Show, but they show arcade games there.

1508
01:44:51,780 --> 01:44:52,420
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes no sense.

1509
01:44:52,720 --> 01:45:01,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, okay, but I did once, though, it's not unheard of, because I did see last year, and Amira was showing off, of all people.

1510
01:45:01,463 --> 01:45:03,584
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't a pump-it-up game, but they were showing off an arcade game.

1511
01:45:03,604 --> 01:45:04,404
[SPEAKER_07]: That game was cool.

1512
01:45:04,424 --> 01:45:06,564
[SPEAKER_07]: That Korean tank, was it a tank game?

1513
01:45:06,584 --> 01:45:07,365
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a shooting game.

1514
01:45:07,425 --> 01:45:08,305
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like a shooting game?

1515
01:45:08,465 --> 01:45:12,106
[SPEAKER_15]: And you had your controls on your gun, and then you had your fire buttons on your gun.

1516
01:45:12,506 --> 01:45:14,987
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm not going to say can't happen.

1517
01:45:15,487 --> 01:45:17,769
[SPEAKER_07]: But very, very unlikely.

1518
01:45:17,829 --> 01:45:19,070
[SPEAKER_07]: But boy, wouldn't that be nice.

1519
01:45:19,291 --> 01:45:20,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it would.

1520
01:45:22,553 --> 01:45:30,260
[SPEAKER_31]: I guess also, since I am going to plug this anytime I can, I'll give you a little more information on Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst.

1521
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:31,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, sure, why not?

1522
01:45:32,482 --> 01:45:35,505
[SPEAKER_31]: This game has been confirmed for the USA and Europe now.

1523
01:45:37,005 --> 01:45:41,349
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard about the new, there was like a Phantasy Star Universe that was coming, but that's a different thing, right?

1524
01:45:41,870 --> 01:45:44,433
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, that is actually the next incarnation of the game.

1525
01:45:44,553 --> 01:45:49,058
[SPEAKER_31]: Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst is basically the next Phantasy Star Online.

1526
01:45:49,198 --> 01:45:54,444
[SPEAKER_31]: It's going to have Episode 4 and all that sort of stuff on it, plus a bunch of new chat options.

1527
01:45:55,025 --> 01:45:56,467
[SPEAKER_31]: And it's slated for a June 2005 release.

1528
01:45:57,972 --> 01:45:58,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Very cool.

1529
01:45:58,432 --> 01:45:59,192
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking forward to it.

1530
01:45:59,432 --> 01:46:00,533
[SPEAKER_07]: I do like Fancy Star.

1531
01:46:01,073 --> 01:46:02,473
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad to see they're still sticking with it.

1532
01:46:03,133 --> 01:46:03,374
[SPEAKER_31]: Yep.

1533
01:46:04,154 --> 01:46:06,214
[SPEAKER_31]: Yuji Naka is not going to let this thing die.

1534
01:46:06,494 --> 01:46:06,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

1535
01:46:07,855 --> 01:46:08,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't let it die.

1536
01:46:09,875 --> 01:46:10,696
[SPEAKER_31]: I'll talk to you later.

1537
01:46:10,716 --> 01:46:10,896
[SPEAKER_31]: All right.

1538
01:46:10,916 --> 01:46:11,496
[SPEAKER_31]: Have a good one, buddy.

1539
01:46:11,976 --> 01:46:12,216
[SPEAKER_31]: All right.

1540
01:46:12,296 --> 01:46:12,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Later.

1541
01:46:13,636 --> 01:46:14,036
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1542
01:46:14,116 --> 01:46:22,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Boy, we should... I feel bad because there's still people trying to get in, but I'm like, we kind of need to move on.

1543
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:24,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't we do this?

1544
01:46:24,359 --> 01:46:24,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh?

1545
01:46:25,380 --> 01:46:25,720
[SPEAKER_07]: One more?

1546
01:46:25,900 --> 01:46:26,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, one more.

1547
01:46:27,230 --> 01:46:27,891
[SPEAKER_07]: One more call.

1548
01:46:29,572 --> 01:46:32,013
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to do one more call, so please hurry up, get in.

1549
01:46:33,214 --> 01:46:39,178
[SPEAKER_07]: www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on Interact With Us, and you can get in on the Skype line.

1550
01:46:39,259 --> 01:46:46,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Skype is a program that you download, and it allows you to call our show so that we don't have to shell out the money for an 800 number because we don't really want to do that.

1551
01:46:49,426 --> 01:46:52,808
[SPEAKER_07]: What's interesting is that in the next studio, we're not going to have a landline.

1552
01:46:53,989 --> 01:46:55,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, let's go to one more call.

1553
01:46:55,910 --> 01:46:56,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1554
01:47:01,479 --> 01:47:02,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, can you hear us?

1555
01:47:04,861 --> 01:47:05,922
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard a little fart noise.

1556
01:47:06,062 --> 01:47:06,962
[SPEAKER_07]: That was about it.

1557
01:47:08,543 --> 01:47:10,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, everybody.

1558
01:47:12,225 --> 01:47:13,766
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Stan Peel.

1559
01:47:15,147 --> 01:47:15,988
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you?

1560
01:47:18,629 --> 01:47:19,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.

1561
01:47:21,511 --> 01:47:22,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you hear me?

1562
01:47:22,611 --> 01:47:23,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I can.

1563
01:47:24,372 --> 01:47:25,533
[SPEAKER_07]: I can hear myself, too.

1564
01:47:27,034 --> 01:47:28,435
[SPEAKER_08]: It's me, Stan Peel.

1565
01:47:28,475 --> 01:47:30,036
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you doing, everybody?

1566
01:47:35,260 --> 01:47:38,380
[SPEAKER_08]: I just gotta say, I love this DDR stuff, man.

1567
01:47:38,780 --> 01:47:40,541
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great for picking up the youngins.

1568
01:47:42,961 --> 01:47:45,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that what you wanted to call in tonight?

1569
01:47:45,902 --> 01:47:48,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Turn down the audio because we're hearing ourselves.

1570
01:47:51,363 --> 01:47:52,583
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that DDR.

1571
01:47:52,603 --> 01:47:53,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you hear me now?

1572
01:47:53,563 --> 01:47:54,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I can hear you.

1573
01:47:54,623 --> 01:47:55,503
[SPEAKER_08]: But I can hear myself.

1574
01:47:55,603 --> 01:47:56,203
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the problem.

1575
01:47:57,764 --> 01:47:59,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no, you shouldn't be able to hear yourself.

1576
01:48:01,206 --> 01:48:01,786
[SPEAKER_08]: That's bad.

1577
01:48:01,906 --> 01:48:03,808
[SPEAKER_08]: You hear yourself, that means you're talking in your head.

1578
01:48:08,090 --> 01:48:08,490
[SPEAKER_08]: It's me.

1579
01:48:08,590 --> 01:48:09,251
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm back, man.

1580
01:48:09,271 --> 01:48:10,171
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that DDR.

1581
01:48:10,191 --> 01:48:11,892
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great for picking up the young ones.

1582
01:48:17,476 --> 01:48:22,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you related to Michael Jackson?

1583
01:48:22,238 --> 01:48:27,482
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, that's not very nice to say.

1584
01:48:27,962 --> 01:48:29,823
[SPEAKER_08]: How dare you insult me like that?

1585
01:48:31,843 --> 01:48:32,844
[SPEAKER_08]: Call me a pedophile.

1586
01:48:32,864 --> 01:48:33,844
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not a pedophile.

1587
01:48:33,924 --> 01:48:36,185
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just a connoisseur of the young flesh.

1588
01:48:42,488 --> 01:48:45,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are you calling in to the show?

1589
01:48:46,430 --> 01:48:47,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Why am I calling in?

1590
01:48:47,431 --> 01:48:48,932
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you why I'm calling in.

1591
01:48:49,872 --> 01:48:51,913
[SPEAKER_08]: I like to say hello.

1592
01:48:52,373 --> 01:48:55,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations to Orange Lounge Radio.

1593
01:48:55,575 --> 01:48:59,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you guys are doing a wonderful service.

1594
01:49:02,110 --> 01:49:02,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you.

1595
01:49:02,570 --> 01:49:03,251
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate it.

1596
01:49:05,432 --> 01:49:09,375
[SPEAKER_08]: You make it easy for us to pick up on the onions.

1597
01:49:10,076 --> 01:49:12,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you in our chat room right now picking up on the onions again?

1598
01:49:13,859 --> 01:49:16,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Who says I'm in your chat room?

1599
01:49:18,742 --> 01:49:20,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I was going to invite you in.

1600
01:49:20,283 --> 01:49:22,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Just head on over to OrangeLinesRadio.com.

1601
01:49:24,614 --> 01:49:26,796
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't know who's in there.

1602
01:49:27,516 --> 01:49:32,560
[SPEAKER_08]: I could be standing right next to you in the chat room looking at you going, that's your precious young thing.

1603
01:49:37,423 --> 01:49:38,524
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm speechless.

1604
01:49:41,085 --> 01:49:42,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's a first.

1605
01:49:45,208 --> 01:49:47,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey-oh, Rob is speechless, everybody.

1606
01:49:50,956 --> 01:49:52,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that wonderful Jamie there?

1607
01:49:53,177 --> 01:49:54,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Jamie's here.

1608
01:49:54,478 --> 01:49:58,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie, Sam wants to talk to you.

1609
01:49:58,500 --> 01:50:01,682
[SPEAKER_08]: I have Crayola sketches of your boobies.

1610
01:50:04,623 --> 01:50:07,564
[SPEAKER_08]: I like using the peach because it's realistic.

1611
01:50:15,048 --> 01:50:16,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh-oh, I got company.

1612
01:50:19,181 --> 01:50:20,442
[SPEAKER_08]: I got somebody here with me.

1613
01:50:20,722 --> 01:50:21,143
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm Ms.

1614
01:50:21,183 --> 01:50:21,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Cleo.

1615
01:50:22,144 --> 01:50:22,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, hello.

1616
01:50:24,586 --> 01:50:25,747
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello, how are you today?

1617
01:50:25,987 --> 01:50:26,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm good.

1618
01:50:26,708 --> 01:50:27,368
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you?

1619
01:50:28,569 --> 01:50:29,430
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hearing things.

1620
01:50:29,510 --> 01:50:29,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you?

1621
01:50:32,453 --> 01:50:33,114
[SPEAKER_09]: How's Ms.

1622
01:50:33,134 --> 01:50:33,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Cleo doing?

1623
01:50:33,534 --> 01:50:33,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Pardon me?

1624
01:50:40,492 --> 01:50:41,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Does Riz Khalil play DDR?

1625
01:50:41,813 --> 01:50:48,318
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm hearing an echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo.

1626
01:50:51,180 --> 01:50:52,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Give me a minute.

1627
01:50:52,081 --> 01:50:53,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me try something here.

1628
01:50:53,922 --> 01:50:58,185
[SPEAKER_08]: I think having two phones connected together is kind of screwing it all up.

1629
01:51:03,849 --> 01:51:06,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Jeez, Rob, don't cry till you pee your pants.

1630
01:51:07,873 --> 01:51:09,514
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll leave that to you, Stan.

1631
01:51:09,854 --> 01:51:11,475
[SPEAKER_06]: You sound like you're getting a little there.

1632
01:51:11,555 --> 01:51:13,155
[SPEAKER_06]: You might be getting to that point.

1633
01:51:16,217 --> 01:51:17,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Jesus, you sound like a freaking harpy.

1634
01:51:17,857 --> 01:51:19,118
[SPEAKER_08]: What the hell is going on?

1635
01:51:20,038 --> 01:51:20,899
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, Stan.

1636
01:51:20,939 --> 01:51:22,179
[SPEAKER_08]: It's your fault.

1637
01:51:24,140 --> 01:51:25,081
[SPEAKER_24]: Pardon me?

1638
01:51:28,242 --> 01:51:31,023
[SPEAKER_08]: My god, things have all gone kooky-kooky-dooky.

1639
01:51:35,425 --> 01:51:36,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, there we go.

1640
01:51:36,566 --> 01:51:37,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no, that didn't work.

1641
01:51:40,087 --> 01:51:47,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Stan, before this echo kills us all, any final words you want to say on this call?

1642
01:51:49,813 --> 01:51:52,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, well, well, God, I can't even do that for real.

1643
01:51:52,355 --> 01:51:53,076
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just freaky.

1644
01:51:54,877 --> 01:52:02,502
[SPEAKER_08]: All I got to say is to all you youngins playing DDR, hello, there we are, just remember one thing.

1645
01:52:03,911 --> 01:52:08,472
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't know who's watching behind you.

1646
01:52:08,572 --> 01:52:10,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Stan.

1647
01:52:10,733 --> 01:52:11,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Peace out, everybody.

1648
01:52:12,073 --> 01:52:12,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Peace out, Stan.

1649
01:52:16,595 --> 01:52:18,455
[SPEAKER_15]: I had to send my ninjas after that picture.

1650
01:52:19,335 --> 01:52:19,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

1651
01:52:23,136 --> 01:52:24,957
[SPEAKER_15]: Did I suggest taking one more call?

1652
01:52:24,997 --> 01:52:25,537
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

1653
01:52:25,577 --> 01:52:27,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was you that said take one more call.

1654
01:52:27,758 --> 01:52:29,498
[SPEAKER_06]: I was ready to move on to the next segment.

1655
01:52:36,889 --> 01:53:03,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Crayola sketches of your boobies DarkSakura you know what and right there hey fellow broadcasters and VIPs listening tonight there's your consideration clip for most unlikely to hear on AM FM radio thank you this has been an Orange Lounge presentation oh hell

1656
01:53:04,284 --> 01:53:06,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we're going to close the Skype line for now, but we will come back later.

1657
01:53:07,166 --> 01:53:12,671
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to go to another break, but we're actually kind of starting to run behind in show, so I think we ought to just go into the next segment, which is kind of weird.

1658
01:53:13,752 --> 01:53:18,076
[SPEAKER_07]: But we're going to go into the Orange Lounge Cage Match, because we need a break, because my face hurts from laughing.

1659
01:53:18,636 --> 01:53:19,156
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously.

1660
01:53:19,637 --> 01:53:22,279
[SPEAKER_07]: And some of our folks in our chat room are saying that too, that they haven't laughed.

1661
01:53:22,299 --> 01:53:24,401
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you need pants for your face so you can be a butthead?

1662
01:53:26,583 --> 01:53:27,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Listen, you.

1663
01:53:29,605 --> 01:53:30,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, um...

1664
01:53:34,324 --> 01:53:35,925
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry to those of you guys that didn't get through.

1665
01:53:36,806 --> 01:53:44,690
[SPEAKER_07]: We will open up the Skype line at the end of the show if we have more time, which I'm thinking we will, if we can go ahead and move on to our next segment, which is the Cage Match.

1666
01:53:44,810 --> 01:53:57,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, in tonight's Cage Match... We have a very interesting scenario in tonight's Cage Match, because we have a song going for a five-week victory tonight.

1667
01:53:58,012 --> 01:54:00,374
[SPEAKER_07]: I tried coming in last week.

1668
01:54:18,801 --> 01:54:19,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1669
01:54:34,827 --> 01:54:37,649
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so, again, a reminder of the way the cage match works.

1670
01:54:37,929 --> 01:54:39,410
[SPEAKER_07]: We play three songs for you guys.

1671
01:54:39,570 --> 01:54:41,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Last week's winner and two new songs.

1672
01:54:41,171 --> 01:54:44,253
[SPEAKER_07]: We play a clip of last week's winner, two new songs in their entirety.

1673
01:54:44,313 --> 01:54:49,697
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys vote for your favorites, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio.

1674
01:54:50,097 --> 01:54:53,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Doesn't have to be a Bomani song, doesn't have to have anything to do with Bomani.

1675
01:54:53,499 --> 01:54:55,601
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just songs that we think are cool.

1676
01:54:56,001 --> 01:54:57,102
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know what?

1677
01:54:57,162 --> 01:55:00,704
[SPEAKER_07]: This cage match, we do have a way of setting trends, because may I remind you...

1678
01:55:01,463 --> 01:55:05,084
[SPEAKER_07]: What songs have we played in the cage match previously that went on to win?

1679
01:55:06,025 --> 01:55:12,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Lava, Wherever You Are, Delirium, After All, Jason Nevins, I'm In Heaven With You.

1680
01:55:12,767 --> 01:55:14,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Where did all these songs end up?

1681
01:55:14,588 --> 01:55:19,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm, DDR, so you never know what might come of the Orange Lounge Radio cage match.

1682
01:55:19,530 --> 01:55:23,692
[SPEAKER_07]: So here it is going for its very, maybe, last win and retirement.

1683
01:55:23,992 --> 01:55:26,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Yoko Kanno, song number one with Rise.

1684
01:55:26,633 --> 01:55:26,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoy.

1685
01:55:57,839 --> 01:55:58,260
S, Actdeft,

1686
01:56:39,518 --> 01:56:40,282
Thanks for watching!

1687
01:57:18,522 --> 01:57:35,098
I want to stand in this waking hell I am With nothing more than I can confuse Pray myself please don't forget Life betrayed and the oppressed Please give me the strength to be at home

1688
01:58:10,248 --> 01:58:14,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, that was a clip of song number one, Yoko Kanno, Rise.

1689
01:58:14,311 --> 01:58:19,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Possibly the third song in Orange Lounge history to be retired tonight, but it's gotta be two competitors.

1690
01:58:20,275 --> 01:58:24,698
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to win, just like every other cage match retiree has done four weeks in a row.

1691
01:58:25,158 --> 01:58:31,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so the first competitor tonight is my choice, and I'm choosing somebody with kind of a college spin.

1692
01:58:32,303 --> 01:58:33,204
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm choosing Beck.

1693
01:58:33,877 --> 01:58:45,261
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a reason why I'm choosing Beck tonight, because Beck's latest EP, he actually did all these 8-bit style remixes of songs from his latest album.

1694
01:58:45,561 --> 01:58:49,442
[SPEAKER_07]: And some of it is just way too cool, I had to put one in the cage match.

1695
01:58:49,742 --> 01:58:58,666
[SPEAKER_07]: So here it is, song number two, this is Beck with a song called Ghetto Chip Malfunction, and it's actually a song called Hell Yes, remixed by 8-Bit.

1696
01:58:58,966 --> 01:58:59,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoy, song number two.

1697
01:59:04,866 --> 01:59:05,167
Yes.

1698
01:59:13,306 --> 01:59:39,938
[SPEAKER_21]: Looking for my place on the summary lines, fake prizes rising out of the bomb holes Skeleton boys hyped up and purple, smoke rings come from across the disco Banknotes burn like broken equipment, looking for shelter, readjust your position Thought control goes with a confession, two dimensions Dumb your head down, duck, don't look now Company missiles, powers rot, you and the cops are watching Make your dreams out of paper mache

1699
01:59:40,458 --> 02:00:07,315
[SPEAKER_20]: Cliché, wasted, hate taste, that's hell Hell yes, now I'm moving this way, I'm doing this thing Hell yes, now I'm turning it on, now I'm working my legs Hell yes, now I'm calling you out, I'm switching my plates Hell yes, now I'm cleaning the floor, my beat is correct Hell yes, yeah that's it, yeah that's it, yeah that's it

1700
02:00:09,068 --> 02:00:09,768
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, that's it.

1701
02:00:24,352 --> 02:00:50,659
[SPEAKER_21]: Pointless, fools anointed to the following stand fair Look for the common, not superficial Cold, red, cold, I woke up home in a crisis For fuck every idols, rewriting the bibles For magic, markers running out of the ink Lives in white out, turn the lights out Fact machine anthems, get your damn hands up Hell yes, now I'm moving this way, I'm doing this thing Hell yes, now I'm turning it on, I'm working my legs

1702
02:00:51,992 --> 02:01:03,265
[SPEAKER_20]: Hell yes, now I'm calling you out, I'm switching my place Hell yes, now I'm clearing the floor, my beat is great Yes, yes, hi, hi, hi

1703
02:01:13,234 --> 02:01:13,834
[SPEAKER_19]: Outro Music

1704
02:01:48,584 --> 02:01:51,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Nevermind that guitar riff there, that accidentally went into the next song there.

1705
02:01:51,745 --> 02:01:54,866
[SPEAKER_07]: That was song number two, Ghetto Chip Malfunction by Beck.

1706
02:01:54,966 --> 02:01:56,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see what everybody thought of that.

1707
02:01:56,647 --> 02:01:57,387
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.

1708
02:01:58,607 --> 02:01:59,508
[SPEAKER_15]: That was pretty cool.

1709
02:01:59,608 --> 02:02:04,649
[SPEAKER_15]: It would give me a headache if I listened to it on repeat, which I would probably do.

1710
02:02:05,409 --> 02:02:06,470
[SPEAKER_15]: So I give it a nine.

1711
02:02:06,970 --> 02:02:08,170
[SPEAKER_15]: A very solid nine.

1712
02:02:08,230 --> 02:02:13,172
[SPEAKER_07]: The EP actually has four songs on it, all in that same style, so it's kind of cool.

1713
02:02:13,212 --> 02:02:16,473
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been listening to very diverse things lately, that's right up my alley, so yeah.

1714
02:02:16,906 --> 02:02:17,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Very cool.

1715
02:02:17,726 --> 02:02:19,707
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's see who's next.

1716
02:02:19,727 --> 02:02:20,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Who else has got a mic?

1717
02:02:20,507 --> 02:02:21,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's got a mic over there?

1718
02:02:21,187 --> 02:02:21,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Jonas.

1719
02:02:21,987 --> 02:02:22,368
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see.

1720
02:02:22,848 --> 02:02:24,208
[SPEAKER_28]: Orgasmic Nostalgia.

1721
02:02:24,628 --> 02:02:25,308
[SPEAKER_28]: It's pretty good.

1722
02:02:25,969 --> 02:02:26,989
[SPEAKER_28]: I like it.

1723
02:02:27,189 --> 02:02:27,509
[SPEAKER_28]: A nine.

1724
02:02:27,689 --> 02:02:28,149
[SPEAKER_07]: A nine.

1725
02:02:28,449 --> 02:02:28,729
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1726
02:02:29,229 --> 02:02:29,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Shark Skrull.

1727
02:02:31,550 --> 02:02:33,631
[SPEAKER_16]: That was pretty nifty, and I don't normally like that.

1728
02:02:34,251 --> 02:02:38,472
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think the remix part of it made it really kind of cool, and I liked the hell yes at the end.

1729
02:02:38,512 --> 02:02:39,352
[SPEAKER_16]: I was like, oh, nifty.

1730
02:02:39,892 --> 02:02:40,092
[SPEAKER_16]: So 9.3759.

1731
02:02:40,513 --> 02:02:41,813
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1732
02:02:41,853 --> 02:02:42,273
[SPEAKER_16]: Islander.

1733
02:02:47,924 --> 02:02:49,944
[SPEAKER_36]: Angel It's back, it's a 9

1734
02:03:16,392 --> 02:03:18,813
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually don't typically care for Beck a whole lot.

1735
02:03:18,853 --> 02:03:21,834
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, he's okay, but again, the 8-bit thing does it for me.

1736
02:03:21,934 --> 02:03:22,394
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it.

1737
02:03:22,514 --> 02:03:23,214
[SPEAKER_07]: Please enjoy.

1738
02:03:23,234 --> 02:03:23,214
9.

1739
02:03:24,235 --> 02:03:24,535
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1740
02:03:25,255 --> 02:03:29,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see if song number 3 is going to win tonight.

1741
02:03:29,636 --> 02:03:31,257
[SPEAKER_07]: And song number 3 is Loki's pick.

1742
02:03:31,357 --> 02:03:32,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, what did you pick for us tonight?

1743
02:03:34,798 --> 02:03:36,158
[SPEAKER_07]: My computer's down right now.

1744
02:03:36,218 --> 02:03:36,919
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in pieces.

1745
02:03:37,359 --> 02:03:39,960
[SPEAKER_16]: Please don't let it be Papa Smurf lick my ass.

1746
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:43,401
[SPEAKER_03]: I already submitted that one, so that doesn't work.

1747
02:03:44,021 --> 02:03:44,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah.

1748
02:03:44,600 --> 02:03:53,547
[SPEAKER_03]: No, um, this song, I had Jamie find me a song real quick, and that's right, folks.

1749
02:03:54,107 --> 02:03:54,848
[SPEAKER_03]: It's girls!

1750
02:03:55,328 --> 02:03:55,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy!

1751
02:06:53,135 --> 02:06:54,937
Thanks for watching!

1752
02:07:34,321 --> 02:07:45,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so how appropriate that the last show at this studio will have Prodigy with Girls, the still shot mix this time in the cage match.

1753
02:07:45,623 --> 02:07:47,123
[SPEAKER_07]: What did we think of the still shot mix?

1754
02:07:47,483 --> 02:07:48,123
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura?

1755
02:07:48,303 --> 02:07:52,144
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a mix of that song that doesn't completely suck donkey ass.

1756
02:07:53,044 --> 02:07:54,965
[SPEAKER_15]: Which is double ass if you think about it.

1757
02:07:56,125 --> 02:07:56,965
[SPEAKER_15]: So it gets an 8.

1758
02:07:58,765 --> 02:07:59,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Get it?

1759
02:07:59,065 --> 02:07:59,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Donkey ass?

1760
02:07:59,745 --> 02:08:00,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Ass ass?

1761
02:08:00,986 --> 02:08:01,986
[SPEAKER_07]: 8 from DarkSakura.

1762
02:08:02,326 --> 02:08:02,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Jonas!

1763
02:08:05,259 --> 02:08:06,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I was trying to go in the same order.

1764
02:08:06,660 --> 02:08:12,305
[SPEAKER_28]: I have to agree, the remix is very great, so... I like the big beat into it, so I'll give it a 9.

1765
02:08:12,465 --> 02:08:14,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, uh, Shark Skrull.

1766
02:08:15,888 --> 02:08:18,229
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm feeling generous in that freaking own 10.

1767
02:08:18,950 --> 02:08:19,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, Islander.

1768
02:08:21,272 --> 02:08:22,293
[SPEAKER_26]: Don't I have a mouthful of cake?

1769
02:08:22,313 --> 02:08:22,593
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll say 9.

1770
02:08:24,735 --> 02:08:27,217
[SPEAKER_26]: Mel B. I was feeling that beat, man.

1771
02:08:27,257 --> 02:08:33,762
[SPEAKER_26]: It's like a throwback to, like, the early 80s Afro-Bambada type, you know, hip-hop, like, old-school, like, breakbeat type stuff.

1772
02:08:34,307 --> 02:08:36,908
[SPEAKER_26]: If I had more room here, I'd do a head spin, so I'd give it a nice 10.

1773
02:08:38,289 --> 02:08:39,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Loki.

1774
02:08:40,570 --> 02:08:44,732
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets a 9, and that belt gets a 10.

1775
02:08:48,514 --> 02:08:50,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, and you know what?

1776
02:08:50,535 --> 02:08:54,157
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate to be the party pooper, but I was only feeling that song for about the first minute.

1777
02:08:54,357 --> 02:08:56,418
[SPEAKER_07]: And once the vocals came in, it kind of lost me.

1778
02:08:56,519 --> 02:08:57,619
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can only really give it like a 6.5.

1779
02:08:58,540 --> 02:08:58,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Angel.

1780
02:08:59,720 --> 02:09:01,221
[SPEAKER_00]: For the beat, I'd give it a 7.

1781
02:09:01,401 --> 02:09:01,681
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.

1782
02:09:02,762 --> 02:09:03,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1783
02:09:03,894 --> 02:09:08,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Very tough decision tonight you guys, but here it is, the three songs you get to vote for.

1784
02:09:08,558 --> 02:09:11,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Song number one, Yoko Kanno with Rise.

1785
02:09:13,882 --> 02:09:15,303
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a bad clip, let me try another clip.

1786
02:09:23,210 --> 02:09:27,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, song number two you can vote for tonight is Beck with Ghetto Chip Malfunction.

1787
02:09:35,560 --> 02:09:40,561
[SPEAKER_07]: And song number three you can vote for tonight is Prodigy with Girls, the Still Shot Mix.

1788
02:09:49,203 --> 02:09:51,384
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, place, vote.

1789
02:09:58,254 --> 02:09:59,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry we had a bit of dead air there for a minute.

1790
02:09:59,555 --> 02:09:59,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry about that.

1791
02:10:00,035 --> 02:10:01,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Place vote now.

1792
02:10:01,576 --> 02:10:03,997
[SPEAKER_07]: You must be in the chat room to place your vote.

02:10:04,617 --> 02:10:07,699
[SPEAKER_07]: www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on chat.

1794
02:10:08,579 --> 02:10:10,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Send a private message to Sky with your vote.

1795
02:10:10,420 --> 02:10:11,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Song number one, Yoko Kanno.

1796
02:10:11,661 --> 02:10:12,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Song number two, Beck.

1797
02:10:12,641 --> 02:10:15,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Song number three, Prodigy.

1798
02:10:15,563 --> 02:10:16,123
[SPEAKER_15]: My butt.

1799
02:10:16,563 --> 02:10:17,664
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, Prodigy.

1800
02:10:18,144 --> 02:10:18,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1801
02:10:20,763 --> 02:10:29,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, Loki, I know you've had kind of a dramatic week and a lot of stuff going on, but you know I have to ask, this is the point of the show where I always want to know, what's going on in the sim scene?

1802
02:10:29,898 --> 02:10:31,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's a few things, actually.

1803
02:10:33,382 --> 02:10:36,703
[SPEAKER_03]: There was XX Mix came out.

1804
02:10:37,083 --> 02:10:39,583
[SPEAKER_03]: It's another Japanese fan mix type thing.

1805
02:10:39,783 --> 02:10:40,323
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of cool.

1806
02:10:40,363 --> 02:10:42,004
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got some pretty interesting songs in there.

1807
02:10:42,324 --> 02:10:47,044
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a really good remix of 501, a really shitty remix of Celebrate Night, so it kind of evens out.

1808
02:10:47,625 --> 02:10:57,546
[SPEAKER_03]: You can find a link for that on Bomae Style under the wonderful Japanese fan mix, like food mix thread, and that's in there.

1809
02:10:57,566 --> 02:11:00,827
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also there was, oh man, what the...

1810
02:11:01,280 --> 02:11:03,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Siberia Style 2.5 came out.

1811
02:11:03,082 --> 02:11:04,544
[SPEAKER_03]: That's also Step Mania skin.

1812
02:11:05,324 --> 02:11:06,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of resembles Techno Fiend.

1813
02:11:06,726 --> 02:11:07,326
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty good.

1814
02:11:07,607 --> 02:11:12,712
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't really noticed any differences between the 2.5 and 2, but I downloaded it anyways.

1815
02:11:12,752 --> 02:11:13,213
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty good.

1816
02:11:14,394 --> 02:11:15,275
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much it for now.

1817
02:11:16,436 --> 02:11:17,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and DDRUK is back up.

1818
02:11:19,179 --> 02:11:20,480
[SPEAKER_03]: But, eh, whatever.

1819
02:11:23,907 --> 02:11:29,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, this is tough because I'm trying to tally votes from tonight's cage match here, so somebody's got to help me fill time.

1820
02:11:30,492 --> 02:11:32,253
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, tell them about some of the other features.

1821
02:11:32,273 --> 02:11:33,735
[SPEAKER_15]: I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts.

1822
02:11:34,375 --> 02:11:39,519
[SPEAKER_15]: Tell them about some of the lovely... What am I supposed to tell people about?

1823
02:11:39,579 --> 02:11:41,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the other lovely programming we have on Orange Laundry.

1824
02:11:41,521 --> 02:11:43,142
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah, we do other shows.

1825
02:11:43,202 --> 02:11:45,584
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we still do Diversion on Monday?

1826
02:11:45,925 --> 02:11:46,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we are.

1827
02:11:46,725 --> 02:11:50,048
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, there's Diversion on Monday, and it starts whenever the hell it feels like playing it.

1828
02:11:50,861 --> 02:11:56,323
[SPEAKER_15]: And then on Tuesday, I do Pump Up the Volume, which is actually Gorilla's Marathon.

1829
02:11:56,363 --> 02:11:56,663
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

1830
02:11:57,443 --> 02:12:02,484
[SPEAKER_15]: Which is actually whatever I feel like playing at the time, or whatever the chat room requests.

1831
02:12:02,544 --> 02:12:08,066
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really supposed to be a request show, but no one ever requests anything except for really bizarre shit I don't have.

1832
02:12:09,326 --> 02:12:11,527
[SPEAKER_15]: Although I do have a bunch of bizarre stuff.

1833
02:12:11,827 --> 02:12:17,109
[SPEAKER_15]: Pre-show starts at a quarter to seven, the show starts at 7.30 to 10.30, or whenever the hell I feel like passing out.

1834
02:12:18,269 --> 02:12:18,369
[SPEAKER_15]: Um...

1835
02:12:19,238 --> 02:12:22,660
[SPEAKER_15]: This Tuesday, by the way, I will not be doing the show on Tuesday.

1836
02:12:23,380 --> 02:12:24,681
[SPEAKER_15]: I will be doing it another night.

1837
02:12:25,621 --> 02:12:27,582
[SPEAKER_15]: Because my ass is taking a night off on my birthday.

1838
02:12:27,662 --> 02:12:28,943
[SPEAKER_15]: So, fuck that.

1839
02:12:30,744 --> 02:12:36,466
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you can check our Orange Lounge Live Journal community for the information on when the show will be rescheduled for.

1840
02:12:36,486 --> 02:12:38,607
[SPEAKER_15]: Eh, responsible bullshit.

1841
02:12:39,408 --> 02:12:42,389
[SPEAKER_15]: Next up is Rob's show, Outside the Box.

1842
02:12:43,029 --> 02:12:46,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, but Outside the Box is actually on hiatus until the station relaunch in May.

1843
02:12:46,391 --> 02:12:48,352
[SPEAKER_15]: So, it comes on eventually.

1844
02:12:48,789 --> 02:12:49,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, eventually.

1845
02:12:49,470 --> 02:12:50,590
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to look forward to that.

1846
02:12:50,770 --> 02:12:55,694
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, maybe we'll have to make some type of arrangement.

1847
02:12:55,774 --> 02:12:58,276
[SPEAKER_15]: I will be doing my show just on a different night.

1848
02:12:59,577 --> 02:13:00,117
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1849
02:13:01,838 --> 02:13:04,780
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we do the repeat thingy.

1850
02:13:06,262 --> 02:13:07,542
[SPEAKER_07]: On DDR Freak, actually.

1851
02:13:07,562 --> 02:13:08,183
[SPEAKER_07]: That's indeed right.

1852
02:13:08,203 --> 02:13:09,264
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to make a mention.

1853
02:13:09,284 --> 02:13:09,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

1854
02:13:10,609 --> 02:13:23,939
[SPEAKER_07]: and we actually have a lot of people that listen over on DDR Freak and so as kind of a thank you to you guys over on DDR Freak for making us kind of a popular little spin-off over on DDR Freak Radio, we actually now are on same week rotation.

1855
02:13:24,439 --> 02:13:30,443
[SPEAKER_07]: So because of the fact that we didn't have a show last week, we used it as a chance to clean the gap there on DDR Freak.

1856
02:13:30,463 --> 02:13:35,207
[SPEAKER_07]: So now you are hearing, when you hear this show, this is the show that we did that same Sunday.

1857
02:13:35,247 --> 02:13:36,468
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to wait a week anymore.

1858
02:13:36,528 --> 02:13:38,249
[SPEAKER_07]: You're actually getting the show the same week we did it.

1859
02:13:38,369 --> 02:13:39,590
[SPEAKER_15]: And you'll be hearing it

1860
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:45,322
[SPEAKER_15]: in like full MP3 Pro quality.

1861
02:13:45,362 --> 02:13:46,763
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, yes.

1862
02:13:46,803 --> 02:13:50,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they have very good quality over there at DDR Freak Radio, so you get a good quality.

1863
02:13:50,505 --> 02:13:54,227
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I'd say it's a pretty nice operation run over there.

1864
02:13:54,307 --> 02:13:54,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1865
02:13:55,908 --> 02:13:58,189
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we have our new spin-off, Ferret Radio.

1866
02:13:59,650 --> 02:14:09,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, when we relaunch in May and kind of things take over again, we're going to be kind of looking for new talent to do some new shows, so...

1867
02:14:10,670 --> 02:14:13,731
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe we need to be doing Orange Lounge Idol.

1868
02:14:14,431 --> 02:14:15,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so we'll see what happens.

1869
02:14:16,391 --> 02:14:23,313
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want to be a part of the best of 2005 nominated Orange Lounge Radio, we're going to have opportunities coming up.

1870
02:14:23,793 --> 02:14:25,533
[SPEAKER_07]: And it doesn't have to be about Bobani.

1871
02:14:26,013 --> 02:14:29,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything gaming related in the slightest, we're going to take.

1872
02:14:29,894 --> 02:14:31,815
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll have more details on that coming soon.

1873
02:14:33,275 --> 02:14:37,736
[SPEAKER_15]: And don't forget about the Kick the Ultracade photobomb.

1874
02:14:37,756 --> 02:14:38,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yes, we have that too.

1875
02:14:39,275 --> 02:14:44,857
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, we need more pictures of people kicking Ultracade machines because those bids are trying to steal the MAME.

1876
02:14:46,817 --> 02:14:50,238
[SPEAKER_07]: I think some of that got settled and that's not happening, but it's still funny.

1877
02:14:50,758 --> 02:14:58,460
[SPEAKER_15]: The fact that the dude tried and he was such a complete retard because MAME was already registered and already somebody else's invention.

1878
02:14:59,020 --> 02:15:04,362
[SPEAKER_15]: So yeah, kick an Ultracade machine out of Love for Orange Lounge and send me the picture.

1879
02:15:05,859 --> 02:15:06,099
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1880
02:15:06,600 --> 02:15:06,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds good.

1881
02:15:07,160 --> 02:15:10,243
[SPEAKER_07]: And only one person has voted for us on Podcast Alley tonight.

1882
02:15:10,463 --> 02:15:14,606
[SPEAKER_07]: So I hope that maybe some of the rest of you guys are just waiting on those email confirmations.

1883
02:15:15,087 --> 02:15:16,008
[SPEAKER_07]: They won't spam you.

1884
02:15:16,208 --> 02:15:20,251
[SPEAKER_07]: There is completely nothing to vote for us over on Podcast Alley.

1885
02:15:20,291 --> 02:15:20,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Please do.

1886
02:15:21,132 --> 02:15:21,772
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd appreciate it.

1887
02:15:23,033 --> 02:15:23,314
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1888
02:15:23,354 --> 02:15:23,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it.

1889
02:15:23,794 --> 02:15:25,335
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys want to hear tonight's winner, the cage match?

1890
02:15:25,936 --> 02:15:26,176
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

1891
02:15:26,316 --> 02:15:26,596
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1892
02:15:26,797 --> 02:15:27,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, here's the interesting thing.

1893
02:15:28,938 --> 02:15:32,321
[SPEAKER_07]: More votes tonight than any other cage match in Orange Lounge Radio history.

1894
02:15:32,962 --> 02:15:33,102
[SPEAKER_24]: Ooh.

1895
02:15:33,682 --> 02:15:41,246
[SPEAKER_07]: So this was now, and somebody in the chat room actually called me on it and said, Sky, you say it every week that the cage match is a hard one to decide.

1896
02:15:41,546 --> 02:15:44,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight definitely is the case because of so many votes.

1897
02:15:44,768 --> 02:15:47,069
[SPEAKER_07]: More votes tonight than any other night.

1898
02:15:47,449 --> 02:15:48,329
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the winner?

1899
02:15:52,631 --> 02:15:55,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Yoko Okano goes into retirement with a

1900
02:15:56,357 --> 02:15:56,697
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm in history.

1901
02:15:56,717 --> 02:15:58,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they said suck, see?

1902
02:15:58,139 --> 02:15:59,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that necessarily a good thing?

1903
02:16:20,932 --> 02:16:22,393
[SPEAKER_16]: It deserves to be retired!

1904
02:16:45,349 --> 02:16:49,891
[SPEAKER_07]: and yeah, DarkSakura has now had one song retired with Yoko Kanno with Rise.

1905
02:16:49,951 --> 02:16:55,174
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've all had one song retired and so when we come back on May 1st

1906
02:16:56,440 --> 02:16:57,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Cage Match starts over.

1907
02:16:57,701 --> 02:16:58,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Cage Match starts new.

1908
02:16:58,601 --> 02:17:00,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Three brand new songs are going to be in it.

1909
02:17:00,222 --> 02:17:01,163
[SPEAKER_07]: So it'll be interesting.

1910
02:17:01,383 --> 02:17:02,784
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to have to change up the theme.

1911
02:17:03,004 --> 02:17:03,784
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have to do something.

1912
02:17:03,804 --> 02:17:05,285
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have to work on that over the next couple of weeks.

1913
02:17:05,445 --> 02:17:06,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Change up the theme.

1914
02:17:06,706 --> 02:17:14,450
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, and by the way, since I made a mention of this to Rob and Loki earlier, I do want to actually give a shout out to some of our listeners.

1915
02:17:14,751 --> 02:17:16,572
[SPEAKER_15]: Those who are some of our UK listeners.

1916
02:17:17,452 --> 02:17:17,632
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi.

1917
02:17:18,833 --> 02:17:19,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, actually, I...

1918
02:17:21,149 --> 02:17:21,849
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

1919
02:17:39,943 --> 02:17:41,824
[SPEAKER_15]: We've gotten some listeners in Japan, too.

1920
02:17:42,144 --> 02:17:44,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Japan is actually one of our biggest country representations.

1921
02:17:44,845 --> 02:17:46,265
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe our third most listened country.

1922
02:17:46,506 --> 02:17:47,866
[SPEAKER_07]: I think number three behind U.S.

1923
02:17:47,886 --> 02:17:48,786
[SPEAKER_07]: and Canada, actually.

1924
02:17:48,967 --> 02:17:52,668
[SPEAKER_07]: I think England itself is actually number four.

1925
02:17:55,589 --> 02:18:07,954
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted to stop and make that mention to our listeners in non-United States countries, because even though we go off on everything happening over here, we're still thinking of you guys, so thank you for listening to us.

1926
02:18:08,857 --> 02:18:09,578
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for watching!

1927
02:18:29,662 --> 02:18:31,083
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's two choices we can do for that.

1928
02:18:31,123 --> 02:18:38,387
[SPEAKER_07]: We can do A, the ultimate cage match with all the retired songs and choose a victor between all three of those retired songs.

1929
02:18:38,547 --> 02:18:40,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, then it wouldn't be a surprise what you're going to hear.

1930
02:18:41,569 --> 02:18:49,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Or choice number two, and the chat room has been begging us to do this for about 70 weeks now, reverse cage match number two.

1931
02:18:49,954 --> 02:18:50,414
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think?

1932
02:18:52,895 --> 02:18:57,378
[SPEAKER_15]: It would be good to end season four with the retirees.

1933
02:18:57,518 --> 02:18:57,718
[SPEAKER_24]: Mm-hmm.

1934
02:18:58,923 --> 02:19:00,644
[SPEAKER_15]: We have three retirees now, right?

1935
02:19:00,684 --> 02:19:00,864
[SPEAKER_24]: Yep.

1936
02:19:04,005 --> 02:19:05,726
[SPEAKER_15]: Why not do both?

1937
02:19:06,206 --> 02:19:07,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we're going to do both next week.

1938
02:19:07,827 --> 02:19:08,827
[SPEAKER_07]: So there'll be two cage matches.

1939
02:19:08,847 --> 02:19:09,667
[SPEAKER_15]: Because we love you guys.

1940
02:19:09,707 --> 02:19:12,469
[SPEAKER_15]: Double ultimate secret cage match.

1941
02:19:12,489 --> 02:19:19,531
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll do the retirees to end season four, and we'll do the reverse cage match to start season five.

1942
02:19:19,711 --> 02:19:22,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, this is season five that's ending right now.

1943
02:19:22,112 --> 02:19:23,193
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it's season six.

1944
02:19:23,553 --> 02:19:25,195
[SPEAKER_07]: The Season of Satan!

1945
02:19:41,936 --> 02:19:48,298
[SPEAKER_07]: In the last reverse cage match, which took place on episode 69... Oh my god, if anyone plays girls, I will kill you.

1946
02:19:49,138 --> 02:19:54,919
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Complicated from DanceMania Speed 9 was banned from the station forever.

1947
02:19:55,760 --> 02:19:59,261
[SPEAKER_07]: So the speed mix of Complicated was banned from the station forever.

1948
02:19:59,601 --> 02:20:00,321
[SPEAKER_07]: We will not play it.

1949
02:20:00,381 --> 02:20:04,582
[SPEAKER_07]: So, both coming back next week.

1950
02:20:04,662 --> 02:20:06,402
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be a two cage match week.

1951
02:20:07,343 --> 02:20:08,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so look for that.

1952
02:20:10,839 --> 02:20:11,219
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1953
02:20:11,619 --> 02:20:13,821
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we need to go to a break.

1954
02:20:15,402 --> 02:20:16,322
[SPEAKER_15]: I need a break or something.

1955
02:20:16,622 --> 02:20:17,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we need a break.

1956
02:20:17,383 --> 02:20:21,385
[SPEAKER_07]: When we come back, we're going to have the FUs of the week and maybe a couple more Skype calls.

1957
02:20:22,425 --> 02:20:23,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Ask Orange Lounge.

1958
02:20:23,346 --> 02:20:25,027
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to do one more of those in the studio.

1959
02:20:25,507 --> 02:20:28,149
[SPEAKER_07]: And whatever else we think of.

1960
02:20:28,309 --> 02:20:30,310
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll be back after this.

1961
02:20:30,870 --> 02:20:35,072
[SPEAKER_07]: In this break, what's a fun theme to do for this break?

1962
02:20:38,154 --> 02:20:38,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

1963
02:20:38,394 --> 02:20:39,515
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm digging through the old songs.

1964
02:20:39,912 --> 02:20:42,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Just play Maximizer three times in a row or something like that.

1965
02:20:42,434 --> 02:20:44,757
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we're not going to do Max.

1966
02:20:45,277 --> 02:20:49,321
[SPEAKER_07]: But we can do songs that start with M. Let's do that.

1967
02:20:49,341 --> 02:20:53,305
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to do songs that start with M. So we'll be back after this break.

1968
02:20:53,726 --> 02:20:55,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Started off with some Matsuri Japan.

1969
02:20:55,327 --> 02:20:56,128
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be back after this.

1970
02:21:59,631 --> 02:22:01,038
Thanks for watching!

1971
02:22:57,956 --> 02:22:58,376
[SPEAKER_10]: and many more.

1972
02:23:45,268 --> 02:23:46,513
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

1973
02:24:13,260 --> 02:24:14,804
Thanks for watching!

1974
02:24:39,589 --> 02:24:42,210
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

1975
02:25:44,754 --> 02:25:48,677
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1976
02:26:30,700 --> 02:26:34,762
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1977
02:27:05,248 --> 02:27:11,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Gaming Radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

1978
02:27:13,933 --> 02:27:15,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1979
02:27:18,676 --> 02:27:21,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we are back here with Orange Lounge Radio.

1980
02:27:22,357 --> 02:27:28,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Currently, radio dedicated to all things Bomani and then some, but in two weeks, what gamers really want to know.

1981
02:27:29,835 --> 02:27:33,377
[SPEAKER_07]: The live show here, what we've got going on in this three-hour program, it's not going to really change.

1982
02:27:33,437 --> 02:27:38,801
[SPEAKER_07]: We still are going to be the source, the premier internet radio source for DDR and other music and rhythm game news.

1983
02:27:38,821 --> 02:27:40,542
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not going to change what we're doing Sunday nights.

1984
02:27:40,882 --> 02:27:49,827
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just the change is going to affect the podcast, which has kind of already happened if you listened to this week's episode, and it also is going to affect the rest of what you hear on the station.

1985
02:27:49,847 --> 02:27:51,908
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be looking for new shows to kind of expand.

1986
02:27:52,289 --> 02:27:56,211
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to be the video gaming internet radio station.

1987
02:27:56,611 --> 02:27:57,572
[SPEAKER_07]: The station.

1988
02:27:58,152 --> 02:28:00,193
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're kind of excited about it, so we're looking forward to it.

1989
02:28:01,353 --> 02:28:04,235
[SPEAKER_15]: We are going to have the biggest adjective ever.

1990
02:28:05,355 --> 02:28:08,856
[SPEAKER_07]: And we know that the only way we're going to achieve this is with your guys' help.

1991
02:28:09,857 --> 02:28:11,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we have an awesome listening base.

1992
02:28:11,517 --> 02:28:17,780
[SPEAKER_07]: There is no way in hell we would ever have been nominated for the Best in Life 365 Awards without our listening base and all these other things we do.

1993
02:28:18,080 --> 02:28:19,161
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys rock.

1994
02:28:19,561 --> 02:28:20,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Love you guys.

1995
02:28:21,081 --> 02:28:21,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Kisses.

1996
02:28:21,742 --> 02:28:22,042
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1997
02:28:22,422 --> 02:28:27,604
[SPEAKER_07]: So, with that being said, let's go from the lovey-dovey chat to the angst and hatred.

1998
02:28:29,102 --> 02:28:30,924
[SPEAKER_07]: chat that you guys have come to know and love.

1999
02:28:32,765 --> 02:28:35,168
[SPEAKER_07]: And hopefully this won't be directed at the listeners tonight.

2000
02:28:36,048 --> 02:28:37,590
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we might want to leave on a good note here.

2001
02:28:37,670 --> 02:28:42,755
[SPEAKER_07]: So, DarkSakura, why is it that we always do these FUs of the week every single week?

2002
02:28:43,035 --> 02:28:44,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Grr, argh.

2003
02:29:01,974 --> 02:29:02,955
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

2004
02:29:03,816 --> 02:29:08,799
[SPEAKER_15]: Big F you to people who drive 10 miles under the speed limit when I'm driving 20 over.

2005
02:29:12,682 --> 02:29:19,807
[SPEAKER_15]: An F you to my driver's side window that keeps rolling down and the sap that fell all over my car windows in a sticky manner that has stayed put.

2006
02:29:20,568 --> 02:29:23,910
[SPEAKER_15]: Little droplets all over my window.

2007
02:29:23,930 --> 02:29:26,472
[SPEAKER_15]: F you to being...

2008
02:29:27,324 --> 02:29:31,387
[SPEAKER_15]: Bored by just about everything since the semester is almost over.

2009
02:29:32,248 --> 02:29:37,092
[SPEAKER_15]: School has gotten into the really boring yet really hectic phase where, Oh my god, I gotta get all this shit done!

2010
02:29:38,033 --> 02:29:38,293
[SPEAKER_15]: You know.

2011
02:29:39,434 --> 02:29:42,817
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, F you to my allergies and springtime in general.

2012
02:29:44,578 --> 02:29:52,124
[SPEAKER_15]: And, uh, F you to, uh, living in my crappy apartment with my, uh, interesting neighbors.

2013
02:29:53,205 --> 02:29:56,948
[SPEAKER_15]: And I mean, by interesting, I mean totally sucky.

2014
02:30:00,521 --> 02:30:02,421
[SPEAKER_15]: No, my neighbors think they're all thug gangsters.

2015
02:30:04,782 --> 02:30:05,042
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

2016
02:30:08,082 --> 02:30:11,003
[SPEAKER_15]: And I mean the really wannabe thinking they are.

2017
02:30:12,003 --> 02:30:12,983
[SPEAKER_15]: The really annoying kind.

2018
02:30:14,023 --> 02:30:19,504
[SPEAKER_15]: If they really were, I'd think, oh, well, that's kind of awesome, but no.

2019
02:30:19,944 --> 02:30:22,685
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, and I want to go back to Alabama.

2020
02:30:22,705 --> 02:30:24,665
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I need grit.

2021
02:30:26,265 --> 02:30:26,585
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm done.

2022
02:30:28,606 --> 02:30:29,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Loki!

2023
02:30:32,389 --> 02:30:34,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you to moving, I hate moving.

2024
02:30:35,351 --> 02:30:36,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving sucks.

2025
02:30:37,452 --> 02:30:41,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I mean, let's see, let's start off with people that drive slow.

2026
02:30:41,975 --> 02:30:46,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Every single person, old person, person in a truck, always driving goddamn slow.

2027
02:30:46,878 --> 02:30:51,721
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm doing, honestly, I'm doing like the speed limit because I don't want to go crazy with my car and stuff.

2028
02:30:51,741 --> 02:30:56,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially when I've got a ton of, you know, boxes in and stuff I can't see out the back window or anything like that.

2029
02:30:57,364 --> 02:30:59,365
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I've been doing pretty good, you know.

2030
02:30:59,705 --> 02:31:01,026
[SPEAKER_03]: But these guys are going like...

2031
02:31:02,363 --> 02:31:26,310
[SPEAKER_03]: 20, and a goddamn 50, okay, stuff like that, it's so awful, um, then, also, the fact that I have just so much crap to pack, that just really sucks, fuck you to my apartment for having a air conditioning unit right next to the bedroom, um, that sounds like a jet engine, you know, firing up, um, in the middle of the night when some bastard upstairs wants his air,

2032
02:31:26,866 --> 02:31:33,868
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not that hot outside, and you just fucking turn on the air conditioning and it's just all... Oh my god!

2033
02:31:34,848 --> 02:31:35,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Jet engine!

2034
02:31:36,569 --> 02:31:46,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, I can sleep through that because I can sleep through anything, but, you know, my, you know, fiancé cannot, and she, you know, didn't like that too much.

2035
02:31:48,372 --> 02:31:54,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, fuck you to the fact that my car's check engine light came on.

2036
02:31:55,114 --> 02:31:55,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Why...

2037
02:31:56,195 --> 02:31:57,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Why now?

2038
02:31:57,575 --> 02:32:00,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially now that moving costs money.

2039
02:32:01,176 --> 02:32:03,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Fixing a car is not exactly on the agenda.

2040
02:32:04,917 --> 02:32:06,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Things are pretty tight as it is.

2041
02:32:06,537 --> 02:32:09,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope nothing majorly wrong is with my car.

2042
02:32:11,138 --> 02:32:14,919
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's something really bad, I can take it to the dealership and they'll fix it.

2043
02:32:15,859 --> 02:32:18,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I've got that extended warranty that, thank God, I bought.

2044
02:32:18,819 --> 02:32:21,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it's just...

2045
02:32:22,099 --> 02:32:24,641
[SPEAKER_03]: We comprise our TV of solid lead and spent uranium

2046
02:32:51,693 --> 02:32:55,615
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I don't understand why that TV's gotta be so damn heavy, but it is.

2047
02:32:56,796 --> 02:32:58,937
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, um, let's see what else.

2048
02:33:00,297 --> 02:33:07,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, fuck you, the, um, mutated, ugly, um, bitch next door that, um, rented me my U-Haul truck because, um,

2049
02:33:08,669 --> 02:33:11,690
[SPEAKER_03]: I rented it online, you know, I reserved a 14-foot truck.

2050
02:33:11,710 --> 02:33:16,791
[SPEAKER_03]: I get there, I've been trying to call you, and I couldn't get a hold of you.

2051
02:33:17,132 --> 02:33:20,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I had, you know, I gave, you know, my work number and my home number.

2052
02:33:21,153 --> 02:33:22,673
[SPEAKER_03]: I never heard a call over here.

2053
02:33:22,853 --> 02:33:24,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I've been sitting here packing.

2054
02:33:24,914 --> 02:33:28,035
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, we don't have a 14-foot truck.

2055
02:33:28,115 --> 02:33:29,275
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to take 10.

2056
02:33:29,955 --> 02:33:31,696
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, okay, fine, I'll take the 10-foot truck.

2057
02:33:31,976 --> 02:33:33,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to be driving at night?

2058
02:33:33,756 --> 02:33:35,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they don't got one headlight.

2059
02:33:36,181 --> 02:33:38,922
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, okay, fine, I'll take the GIMP truck.

2060
02:33:39,462 --> 02:33:41,723
[SPEAKER_03]: So then I take the GIMP truck, drive it around.

2061
02:33:42,083 --> 02:33:45,585
[SPEAKER_03]: The fucking, um, you know, everything's breaking on this thing.

2062
02:33:45,605 --> 02:33:50,787
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, oh my god, let's get this packed and done with, you know, before the truck falls apart.

2063
02:33:51,067 --> 02:33:52,168
[SPEAKER_03]: We can get it back to her.

2064
02:33:52,508 --> 02:33:55,269
[SPEAKER_03]: And honestly, we drove a total of seven miles.

2065
02:33:56,302 --> 02:34:20,754
[SPEAKER_03]: 7 miles, the gas gauge is full, it's still on full, we get there, you only drove 7 miles, you probably didn't even fill it up, I'm charging you $3 for gas, for 7 miles, I mean, granted, I understand, you know, this might be like an SUV, but, you know, I don't think I used $7 for the gas driving 7 miles, or, you know, $3 for the gas, whatever it is, I mean, shit,

2066
02:34:22,262 --> 02:34:28,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and not to mention that the truck cost me, um, $19.99 to start off with, $1.19 a mile.

2067
02:34:28,546 --> 02:34:40,253
[SPEAKER_03]: $7 for the goddamn dolly, and then $5 for convenience fee for on- What the fuck, I got charged $5 for convenience fee online, not to get the same truck I want, instead I get a gimp truck.

2068
02:34:40,493 --> 02:34:41,414
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck is that?

2069
02:34:41,634 --> 02:34:46,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's Jamie when you need her, because she would be yelling at you, she would be filing a complaint for you right now.

2070
02:34:47,477 --> 02:34:48,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Here she comes!

2071
02:34:50,629 --> 02:34:52,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you to the chair for eating the microphone.

2072
02:34:53,530 --> 02:34:54,211
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, what did I miss?

2073
02:34:54,231 --> 02:34:55,151
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I was pulling my laundry.

2074
02:34:56,072 --> 02:34:58,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Run by the bill again and why you got charged.

2075
02:34:58,693 --> 02:35:03,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so ugly, you know, inbred bitch next door.

2076
02:35:04,115 --> 02:35:15,901
[SPEAKER_03]: She, oh, might I add, she, for anyone that's out there that's seen Men in Black, okay, you know there's a point in the movie where this evil alien thing takes over a human host body and kind of

2077
02:35:17,034 --> 02:35:20,537
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2078
02:35:43,519 --> 02:35:50,306
[SPEAKER_15]: Talk to your manager, write the Better Business Bureau, send a copy of the letter CCA to her, CCA, you know, send it to the Better Business Bureau, and keep a damn copy.

2079
02:35:51,307 --> 02:35:57,132
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I love having her around, because she'll just, she'll tell you how to fuck with somebody.

2080
02:35:59,114 --> 02:36:01,236
[SPEAKER_15]: I live to prove people wrong.

2081
02:36:02,498 --> 02:36:06,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and then to top it off, at the very end of when I got done dealing with her,

2082
02:36:07,469 --> 02:36:12,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know I need high schoolers that might want to work here on the weekend with me?

2083
02:36:13,018 --> 02:36:17,486
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, no one that I would want to subject you to.

2084
02:36:18,147 --> 02:36:19,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, that's all.

2085
02:36:19,870 --> 02:36:20,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on.

2086
02:36:26,292 --> 02:36:27,293
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they just keep getting worse.

2087
02:36:28,393 --> 02:36:31,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I made this quick because I know we've got a lot of chat FUs and stuff.

2088
02:36:32,035 --> 02:36:37,498
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to give a really quick FU to having to move because I hate packing stuff up and all that stuff.

2089
02:36:37,978 --> 02:36:47,623
[SPEAKER_07]: And just an FU to Final Fantasy XI for pissing me off the past couple days and just having really bad parties.

2090
02:36:48,364 --> 02:36:49,064
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's really all.

2091
02:36:49,544 --> 02:36:50,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, I'm fine.

2092
02:36:50,585 --> 02:36:50,845
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

2093
02:36:51,245 --> 02:36:51,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Except for today.

2094
02:36:51,905 --> 02:36:52,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Today was great.

2095
02:36:53,848 --> 02:36:59,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Goddamn you fucking link shell members and doing your fucking, you know, JSA stuff.

2096
02:36:59,550 --> 02:37:01,111
[SPEAKER_03]: I fucking, or JSE stuff.

2097
02:37:01,691 --> 02:37:06,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Goddamn you people and your artifact armor not helping me out but doing everybody else's in the link shell.

2098
02:37:07,073 --> 02:37:08,394
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna hunt you down and kill you.

2099
02:37:08,734 --> 02:37:11,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's move on to the in-studio FUs.

2100
02:37:11,375 --> 02:37:12,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Guys, please keep them short tonight.

2101
02:37:12,675 --> 02:37:13,415
[SPEAKER_07]: We're running out of time.

2102
02:37:13,576 --> 02:37:13,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Angel.

2103
02:37:15,376 --> 02:37:22,439
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, FU to the stupid radio stations has decided to take over the bowling alley in which I decided to play DDR every week.

2104
02:37:23,510 --> 02:37:24,330
[SPEAKER_00]: Mmm, yeah.

2105
02:37:25,771 --> 02:37:30,212
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, because they stopped us at the door and they were like, you need to pay 50 bucks to get in.

2106
02:37:30,252 --> 02:37:30,892
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, huh?

2107
02:37:31,912 --> 02:37:33,493
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to pay 50 bucks to get in.

2108
02:37:33,553 --> 02:37:36,614
[SPEAKER_00]: Please turn around and leave if you're not gonna... And I'm like, huh?

2109
02:37:36,814 --> 02:37:37,114
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

2110
02:37:37,274 --> 02:37:37,554
[SPEAKER_00]: Who?

2111
02:37:37,954 --> 02:37:47,757
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, uh, I didn't... So, um, I was just like, whatever.

2112
02:37:47,997 --> 02:37:50,998
[SPEAKER_15]: So we turn around and leave and, like, went to go play DDR somewhere else.

2113
02:37:51,570 --> 02:37:57,052
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm not telling you where, at least on the air, because that's just an embarrassment even to me.

2114
02:37:57,732 --> 02:38:11,998
[SPEAKER_00]: But I found out later through Lab Journal that the only reason that they were charging $50 to get into the place was the fact that they had some basketball player there that was signing autographs.

2115
02:38:12,638 --> 02:38:14,539
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going, the hell?

2116
02:38:14,919 --> 02:38:16,560
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, whatever.

2117
02:38:17,556 --> 02:38:27,508
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to go on about how that's weird, because I'm like, what, are the League people going to have to pay $50 too?

2118
02:38:28,630 --> 02:38:30,732
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't answer that.

2119
02:38:30,752 --> 02:38:37,300
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel that person that MPK'd us, because that sucks on Final Fantasy XI, you don't just leave like, you know,

2120
02:38:38,707 --> 02:38:42,669
[SPEAKER_00]: 3, no, 4 monsters that are like way beyond a party's level and then just teleport out.

2121
02:38:42,709 --> 02:38:43,429
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, what the?

2122
02:38:43,809 --> 02:38:44,730
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, great, we're dead.

2123
02:38:46,931 --> 02:38:47,451
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, bye.

2124
02:38:48,551 --> 02:38:48,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Mal.

2125
02:38:49,892 --> 02:38:50,732
[SPEAKER_26]: Uh, keep them quick.

2126
02:38:51,352 --> 02:38:53,353
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, F you to the gas prices right now.

2127
02:38:53,373 --> 02:38:56,555
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm having to pay at least $2.60 for a gallon.

2128
02:38:56,635 --> 02:39:02,337
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, up in Sacto, I saw like $2.53 for the cheapest unleaded and I thought, wow, that is cheap.

2129
02:39:03,988 --> 02:39:07,850
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, meanwhile, back in my, you know, neck of the woods, it's like, it's in the mid-260s.

2130
02:39:07,890 --> 02:39:09,151
[SPEAKER_27]: That's just gotta go, man.

2131
02:39:10,751 --> 02:39:17,435
[SPEAKER_27]: And, um, I guess the other F you would be to, uh, ugly chicks who wear those shirts that say hottie or cutie or something.

2132
02:39:17,575 --> 02:39:21,838
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know, I mean, look, I ain't trying to hate or nothing.

2133
02:39:22,078 --> 02:39:24,439
[SPEAKER_27]: I know, you know, beauty is cutie and all that kind of good stuff.

2134
02:39:24,519 --> 02:39:28,381
[SPEAKER_27]: It's like, I can understand if you wear a shirt that says, like, angel or princess.

2135
02:39:28,441 --> 02:39:31,683
[SPEAKER_27]: I know you're somebody's, you know, little toy, but you know what?

2136
02:39:32,527 --> 02:39:35,348
[SPEAKER_27]: I just, you know, a word of, just, you know, a little rule of thumb.

2137
02:39:35,808 --> 02:39:39,149
[SPEAKER_27]: If your shirt is 4XL, you do not deserve to wear cutie on it.

2138
02:39:41,849 --> 02:39:42,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, Shark's Girl.

2139
02:39:44,370 --> 02:39:48,451
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm very mellow, so I don't really have anything, which is unusual for me.

2140
02:39:49,031 --> 02:39:49,852
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm just quiet.

2141
02:39:50,472 --> 02:39:51,232
[SPEAKER_16]: Yay, happy.

2142
02:39:51,652 --> 02:39:53,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, F you not being angsty.

2143
02:39:53,613 --> 02:39:54,333
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, F you.

2144
02:39:54,413 --> 02:39:55,133
[SPEAKER_16]: There you go.

2145
02:39:55,233 --> 02:39:55,953
[SPEAKER_16]: Now you happy?

2146
02:39:56,293 --> 02:39:56,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, very.

2147
02:39:57,053 --> 02:39:57,313
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2148
02:39:57,994 --> 02:39:58,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Islander.

2149
02:39:59,214 --> 02:39:59,294
[SPEAKER_36]: Uh,

2150
02:40:00,069 --> 02:40:08,914
[SPEAKER_36]: Just F you to EA Sports Online because I refuse to play my favorite game, my NBA Live, until the rosters are updated from all the major stuff that went down two months ago.

2151
02:40:11,856 --> 02:40:13,297
[SPEAKER_28]: Explicit.

2152
02:40:16,359 --> 02:40:19,481
[SPEAKER_28]: I want to give an F you to the Cheesecake Factor for charging me $420 on the whole meal.

2153
02:40:19,501 --> 02:40:19,481
$420!

2154
02:40:19,521 --> 02:40:20,962
[SPEAKER_28]: $420!

2155
02:40:19,581 --> 02:40:20,962
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see, there's 32 people.

2156
02:40:30,720 --> 02:40:36,921
[SPEAKER_06]: After counting... Okay, including the... Damn, that's a lot of cheesecake.

2157
02:40:36,981 --> 02:40:39,802
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to need one of those 4XL cutie shirts after that.

2158
02:40:43,503 --> 02:40:44,263
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, okay, okay.

2159
02:40:44,683 --> 02:40:55,125
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyways, in a serious note, I understand that $60 went to the gratuity and $30 went to tax, but how the hell were we fucking $160 deficits?

2160
02:40:56,066 --> 02:40:57,246
[SPEAKER_28]: Someone didn't pay for their meal and...

2161
02:40:57,802 --> 02:41:02,023
[SPEAKER_28]: If I find out who the hell did not pay for their meals, I'm going to be pissed off and beat the living shit out of them.

2162
02:41:02,944 --> 02:41:05,824
[SPEAKER_28]: I know that 32 people came in, but I know someone's lying on paying their meals.

2163
02:41:06,885 --> 02:41:07,225
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

2164
02:41:08,445 --> 02:41:15,247
[SPEAKER_28]: If it is one girl who bitch slapped me because she thinks I poked her with my penis on the bed... What?

2165
02:41:17,428 --> 02:41:19,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, slow down, buddy.

2166
02:41:19,208 --> 02:41:19,448
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

2167
02:41:20,189 --> 02:41:20,529
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2168
02:41:20,929 --> 02:41:21,529
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to give you...

2169
02:41:23,088 --> 02:41:24,789
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, make it quick, we gotta wrap this up.

2170
02:41:24,809 --> 02:41:32,895
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, I have to go through this one girl who bitch slapped me because she thought I poked her with a penis on her butt cheek.

2171
02:41:35,097 --> 02:41:36,117
[SPEAKER_06]: But you don't get boners.

2172
02:41:38,659 --> 02:41:41,401
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, first of all, that was a point, that was a racket.

2173
02:41:42,442 --> 02:41:44,063
[SPEAKER_28]: That was a pointy part of the racket.

2174
02:41:44,123 --> 02:41:46,825
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a flat, it's not round, it's not warm.

2175
02:41:46,885 --> 02:41:48,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that what the kids are calling it these days?

2176
02:41:49,944 --> 02:41:52,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's just, you want to see my pointy part of the racket?

2177
02:41:52,787 --> 02:41:54,228
[SPEAKER_03]: You weren't just happy to see her, right?

2178
02:41:54,368 --> 02:41:57,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, how are you around poking people with their penis anyways?

2179
02:41:57,171 --> 02:42:00,073
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, it was a Reddit place, how do you know who that girl is?

2180
02:42:02,896 --> 02:42:08,721
[SPEAKER_28]: F you to all this drama ruckus all over DDR, goddammit, pick your goddamn people wisely.

2181
02:42:08,861 --> 02:42:12,804
[SPEAKER_28]: Don't say, ooh, I love this person, I love this, but I feel happiness for this.

2182
02:42:13,305 --> 02:42:16,908
[SPEAKER_28]: Blah, blah, blah, you're picking your drama all over me, saying I'm supposed to be

2183
02:42:17,942 --> 02:42:19,022
[SPEAKER_28]: The God of Relationships.

2184
02:42:19,383 --> 02:42:22,924
[SPEAKER_28]: I can't solve everyone's relationships each and every fucking time.

2185
02:42:25,664 --> 02:42:26,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, do be continued.

2186
02:42:27,085 --> 02:42:27,705
[SPEAKER_15]: But I can.

2187
02:42:27,745 --> 02:42:28,705
[SPEAKER_15]: It's called cyanide.

2188
02:42:29,105 --> 02:42:31,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, one quick one before we get chatroom interviews.

2189
02:42:32,727 --> 02:42:33,887
[SPEAKER_15]: I forgot what it was.

2190
02:42:34,187 --> 02:42:35,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Remind us later.

2191
02:42:35,287 --> 02:42:35,567
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2192
02:42:36,028 --> 02:42:38,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Guys, if they're long, they're getting cut short tonight.

2193
02:42:38,228 --> 02:42:38,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

2194
02:42:39,309 --> 02:42:39,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Ram.

2195
02:42:40,569 --> 02:42:41,569
[SPEAKER_07]: R-H-A-Y-A-M.

2196
02:42:41,609 --> 02:42:42,289
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's Ram.

2197
02:42:43,590 --> 02:42:43,990
[SPEAKER_07]: I could have.

2198
02:42:44,434 --> 02:42:47,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Sworn, I had this problem last week, or I wasn't sure how to pronounce this, but I think it's Ram.

2199
02:42:48,677 --> 02:42:52,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Says, F you to freaking long winter that wreak havoc with my sinuses.

2200
02:42:54,582 --> 02:42:59,625
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100Matt says, F you to my tire blowing out at the worst time possible on the highway.

2201
02:42:59,886 --> 02:43:00,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Ouch.

2202
02:43:00,706 --> 02:43:02,428
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to the Yankees losing streak.

2203
02:43:02,528 --> 02:43:03,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Go Yanks.

2204
02:43:04,489 --> 02:43:10,634
[SPEAKER_07]: LemonLimeJump says, F you to my interweb connection crapping out on me so I couldn't listen to Pump Up the Volume on Tuesday night.

2205
02:43:11,975 --> 02:43:12,295
[SPEAKER_00]: Sniff.

2206
02:43:12,921 --> 02:43:15,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Elmullet says, F you to company and console fanboys.

2207
02:43:16,003 --> 02:43:19,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't you have fun with your games and systems without sucking out the enjoyment of others?

2208
02:43:20,045 --> 02:43:23,366
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking at you, Sony fanboys, and you too, Nintendo fanboys.

2209
02:43:24,447 --> 02:43:25,687
[SPEAKER_07]: How about both systems suck?

2210
02:43:26,348 --> 02:43:27,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I be on that side?

2211
02:43:27,128 --> 02:43:27,588
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding.

2212
02:43:27,708 --> 02:43:28,769
[SPEAKER_07]: They're actually both really good.

2213
02:43:29,069 --> 02:43:29,990
[SPEAKER_07]: In their own special way.

2214
02:43:30,810 --> 02:43:34,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Blarg says, F you to getting banned from a bar for sneaking in booze.

2215
02:43:37,108 --> 02:43:39,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you do know the purpose of a bar, right?

2216
02:43:40,051 --> 02:43:41,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, whatever.

2217
02:43:41,632 --> 02:43:46,757
[SPEAKER_07]: He also says, F you to getting banned from 4chan.

2218
02:43:49,900 --> 02:43:58,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Fireboma says, my F you is to the assholes at EB Games for selling out of PSPs too quickly and then not getting another shipment in for another couple of weeks.

2219
02:43:59,679 --> 02:44:01,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but they hardly control that.

2220
02:44:01,561 --> 02:44:06,466
[SPEAKER_07]: Illusion says F you to not being able to go to the bowling alley on Friday because Larry was busy ice skating.

2221
02:44:06,666 --> 02:44:07,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Ice skating!

2222
02:44:07,868 --> 02:44:08,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

2223
02:44:09,469 --> 02:44:17,898
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to hardly anyone showing up for karaoke on Saturday night and F you to myself for coming up with such lame-ass F yous to be on the last episode in that studio.

2224
02:44:17,978 --> 02:44:18,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't worry.

2225
02:44:19,200 --> 02:44:20,161
[SPEAKER_07]: We are starting over.

2226
02:44:21,149 --> 02:44:27,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Toshin says F you to cheap arcade owners who can buy a 12K gun game but not a 2DX machine.

2227
02:44:28,475 --> 02:44:30,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm, sounds like what happened at Scandia.

2228
02:44:34,139 --> 02:44:37,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Dork says F you to my English teacher for being totally anal.

2229
02:44:37,542 --> 02:44:43,167
[SPEAKER_07]: If the paper is good and the content is good, why the hell are you going to put an F on my paper for a stupid title?

2230
02:44:44,817 --> 02:44:47,779
[SPEAKER_07]: MPQ says, I just took up 2DX and I have one FU.

2231
02:44:47,919 --> 02:44:52,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck the Safari, fuck Stoic, and fuck all the 2DX bullshit running through those songs.

2232
02:44:52,842 --> 02:44:54,082
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to like those songs, too.

2233
02:44:55,503 --> 02:44:57,884
[SPEAKER_07]: That got a nice big word from our studio there.

2234
02:44:59,025 --> 02:45:03,407
[SPEAKER_07]: LXLDubes says, my FU also goes to fake thug gangstas.

2235
02:45:03,868 --> 02:45:09,831
[SPEAKER_07]: The next time I see a nerd white boy walking in my school with shorts down to his ankles, I'm gonna commit suicide.

2236
02:45:10,871 --> 02:45:15,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Another FU to Sin City for making me stay up until 2 in the morning at Muviko?

2237
02:45:15,413 --> 02:45:16,374
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry if I mispronounced that.

2238
02:45:17,114 --> 02:45:21,056
[SPEAKER_07]: I played a game of DDR in their arcade after the movie and almost fell asleep while playing.

2239
02:45:21,637 --> 02:45:23,918
[SPEAKER_07]: FU to parents for not believing me when I tell the truth.

2240
02:45:24,418 --> 02:45:26,479
[SPEAKER_07]: FU to myself for sucking at life so bad.

2241
02:45:26,559 --> 02:45:30,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and another FU to staying home alone, because I can't think of any better FUs.

2242
02:45:31,822 --> 02:45:39,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Legend of Zaku says, FU to New York State University Police for being the pigs that they are by holding the students down when they want to make noise at 3 a.m.

2243
02:45:39,125 --> 02:45:39,766
[SPEAKER_07]: in the morning.

2244
02:45:42,102 --> 02:45:43,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't you know people are trying to study?

2245
02:45:45,664 --> 02:45:49,007
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to still not being able to buy a Konami 2DX controller for hella cheap.

2246
02:45:49,187 --> 02:45:54,891
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to my lame ass, ant infested, beater of an apartment that I was sent to this year by my campus.

2247
02:45:56,652 --> 02:46:01,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Dark Knight says my F you for this week goes to work for being such evil ass hats.

2248
02:46:01,775 --> 02:46:04,257
[SPEAKER_07]: And an F you to me for being a broke ass negro.

2249
02:46:05,118 --> 02:46:05,698
[SPEAKER_07]: That's his words.

2250
02:46:06,579 --> 02:46:08,520
[SPEAKER_07]: DDArchaholic, last one.

2251
02:46:09,494 --> 02:46:13,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Daniel, D-Arcoholics passing along one for Daniel.

2252
02:46:13,375 --> 02:46:16,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Daniel says, F you to my ex-wife for making my life a living hell.

2253
02:46:17,476 --> 02:46:20,617
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's a good one to end the F you segment on.

2254
02:46:20,757 --> 02:46:21,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Two more.

2255
02:46:21,897 --> 02:46:22,677
[SPEAKER_28]: Two really quick ones.

2256
02:46:23,517 --> 02:46:23,858
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright.

2257
02:46:23,878 --> 02:46:24,178
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

2258
02:46:24,558 --> 02:46:29,439
[SPEAKER_28]: And F you goes to taxes for being a bitch for not sending me my refunds yet.

2259
02:46:30,119 --> 02:46:32,720
[SPEAKER_28]: I filed my taxes like two months ago and still haven't got my refund.

2260
02:46:33,880 --> 02:46:34,700
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, I'll check that out.

2261
02:46:35,280 --> 02:46:37,261
[SPEAKER_28]: And F you did his dog for pissing on my tires.

2262
02:46:37,381 --> 02:46:37,581
[SPEAKER_28]: This is...

2263
02:46:40,492 --> 02:46:47,195
[SPEAKER_15]: I have no pity for the people who haven't gotten their tax money yet.

2264
02:46:47,215 --> 02:46:52,797
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, Jonas, because I did mine like three months ago, and I got my money two months ago.

2265
02:46:54,418 --> 02:46:58,940
[SPEAKER_15]: If you hop on it right when you get it and tele-file, you get your money awfully fast.

2266
02:47:08,310 --> 02:47:11,592
[SPEAKER_36]: I would also like to say that I now have no credit, we have no credit card debt.

2267
02:47:37,797 --> 02:47:38,738
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm so happy.

2268
02:47:41,800 --> 02:47:42,400
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, guys.

2269
02:47:42,560 --> 02:47:45,842
[SPEAKER_03]: I could have had a larger refund if fucking golf lane had fucked me over.

2270
02:47:48,604 --> 02:47:48,924
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2271
02:47:50,225 --> 02:47:52,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Ten more minutes left in the show, you guys.

2272
02:47:52,366 --> 02:47:57,609
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's kind of the end of the season, the end of a big chapter here in the Orange Lounge radio book.

2273
02:47:58,070 --> 02:47:59,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, you know, we've got a little bit of time left.

2274
02:47:59,971 --> 02:48:03,113
[SPEAKER_07]: And what do we always do when we have a little time left at the end of the show?

2275
02:48:04,173 --> 02:48:06,495
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's ask the Orange Lounge a question.

2276
02:48:10,879 --> 02:48:12,600
[SPEAKER_24]: Can I ax you a question?

2277
02:48:12,901 --> 02:48:15,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's ax Orange Lounge some stupid question.

2278
02:48:16,384 --> 02:48:19,606
[SPEAKER_07]: What will we find out tonight on Orange Lounge Radio?

2279
02:48:19,967 --> 02:48:23,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Will they ax about the studio since last week we are here?

2280
02:48:23,710 --> 02:48:27,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Or will they ax a question about the new place where we're gonna be?

2281
02:48:27,273 --> 02:48:28,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Or will they ax something else?

2282
02:48:33,257 --> 02:48:36,180
[SPEAKER_14]: Excuse me, I want to ax you a few questions.

2283
02:48:37,964 --> 02:48:50,570
[SPEAKER_07]: L. Mullet, assuming Orange Lounge, the band, ever sued you and made you change your name, what would you call your station in its place?

2284
02:48:51,390 --> 02:48:56,513
[SPEAKER_15]: I've researched that they can't sue us, ha ha ha, because it's not registered in the United States.

2285
02:48:56,533 --> 02:48:57,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it'll never happen.

2286
02:48:57,513 --> 02:48:59,234
[SPEAKER_07]: He says, yes, it'll never happen, but what if?

2287
02:49:00,168 --> 02:49:03,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Purple Lounge Radio I was thinking after the store that Dan owned, Game On

2288
02:49:24,136 --> 02:49:25,237
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be a good one, too.

2289
02:49:25,297 --> 02:49:29,121
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't really ever sat down and talked about this, but Jamie actually... Jamie's gonna kick your ass!

2290
02:49:29,181 --> 02:49:34,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie researched a trademark, and since Orange Lounge actually isn't trademarked in the U.S., we can have it.

2291
02:49:34,605 --> 02:49:37,508
[SPEAKER_07]: But Konami knows what we're doing, and they don't care.

2292
02:49:37,848 --> 02:49:41,011
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll do what Kentucky Fried Chicken does and just call ourselves OLR.

2293
02:49:41,952 --> 02:49:44,694
[SPEAKER_07]: That's possible as well, so... Alright, anyway.

2294
02:49:45,895 --> 02:49:46,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see...

2295
02:49:49,987 --> 02:49:51,868
[SPEAKER_07]: They're giving us all these Spanish names in the chatroom.

2296
02:49:51,888 --> 02:49:52,849
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what that is about.

2297
02:49:53,009 --> 02:49:53,990
[SPEAKER_15]: El Pantalon.

2298
02:49:54,590 --> 02:49:58,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Fireboma says, how many licks does it take to get to the center of Loki's pants?

2299
02:50:01,996 --> 02:50:07,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, hey, you know, when there's a giant gaping hole in them, one.

2300
02:50:08,741 --> 02:50:10,562
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not a question you need to be asking us.

2301
02:50:10,602 --> 02:50:11,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, honestly.

2302
02:50:11,843 --> 02:50:15,806
[SPEAKER_07]: We will give you his girlfriend's email address, and you can just ask her directly.

2303
02:50:16,227 --> 02:50:17,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Why you want to know this, I don't know.

2304
02:50:20,154 --> 02:50:20,994
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Morpheus

2305
02:50:49,713 --> 02:50:50,054
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed.

2306
02:50:50,715 --> 02:50:51,716
[SPEAKER_00]: See, Travis?

2307
02:50:52,056 --> 02:50:53,338
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't bullshit me anymore.

2308
02:50:53,538 --> 02:50:54,800
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, uh, yeah.

2309
02:50:55,041 --> 02:50:56,242
[SPEAKER_00]: I just gave you a shout-out, so there, bye.

2310
02:50:57,865 --> 02:50:58,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2311
02:50:59,206 --> 02:51:00,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, LXLDubes.

2312
02:51:02,193 --> 02:51:05,074
[SPEAKER_07]: Why does everyone hate Stoic, Safari, etc.

2313
02:51:05,194 --> 02:51:06,535
[SPEAKER_07]: after the new 2DX?

2314
02:51:06,675 --> 02:51:08,656
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't hate Stoic, it's Taku.

2315
02:51:08,856 --> 02:51:11,217
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, I don't really follow 2DX.

2316
02:51:11,377 --> 02:51:14,559
[SPEAKER_27]: The Safari was never meant to be 150 BPM, that's why.

2317
02:51:14,619 --> 02:51:18,841
[SPEAKER_07]: That is actually a big reason why people have a beef with the Safari and the song Get On Beat.

2318
02:51:19,121 --> 02:51:23,823
[SPEAKER_07]: When they originally appeared in 3rd and 4th style respectively, they were about 40 BPM.

2319
02:51:24,523 --> 02:51:25,724
[SPEAKER_07]: About 130-ish.

2320
02:51:25,864 --> 02:51:29,946
[SPEAKER_14]: I've come close to actually beating them, and now I can't and never will.

2321
02:51:30,266 --> 02:51:39,571
[SPEAKER_07]: For some reason, and we have no idea why, but when 6th style came out, they sped them up to 160 BPM, and speeding up a song makes it harder in 2DX.

2322
02:51:39,611 --> 02:51:42,752
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to hit more keys in a minute, it just automatically makes the song harder.

2323
02:51:43,072 --> 02:51:48,435
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, there was another I was playing in 9th style the other day, the another is just the same damn song sped up.

2324
02:51:49,329 --> 02:51:49,849
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crazy.

2325
02:51:50,630 --> 02:51:51,650
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't even remember what it was, though.

2326
02:51:51,670 --> 02:51:53,271
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's Distress, I want to say.

2327
02:51:53,351 --> 02:51:54,271
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's Distress, another.

2328
02:51:54,371 --> 02:51:54,952
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just sped up.

2329
02:51:55,592 --> 02:52:01,295
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that there was one, I don't remember what it was, that had freezes in it, or where it stopped.

2330
02:52:01,795 --> 02:52:04,496
[SPEAKER_15]: But in the another, it speeds up or something.

2331
02:52:04,817 --> 02:52:05,617
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't remember what song it was.

2332
02:52:05,677 --> 02:52:06,597
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it was on 4th style.

2333
02:52:07,558 --> 02:52:08,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I know what you're talking about.

2334
02:52:08,638 --> 02:52:09,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Get On Beat?

2335
02:52:09,399 --> 02:52:10,459
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it wasn't Get On Beat.

2336
02:52:10,479 --> 02:52:11,640
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Checking You Out.

2337
02:52:12,020 --> 02:52:12,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Taku?

2338
02:52:13,321 --> 02:52:16,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Checking You Out was faster on... But it did it both ways.

2339
02:52:17,142 --> 02:52:17,463
[SPEAKER_15]: It was...

2340
02:52:19,418 --> 02:52:20,159
[SPEAKER_15]: Radical Faith?

2341
02:52:21,140 --> 02:52:22,041
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it was Radical Faith.

2342
02:52:22,081 --> 02:52:24,524
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought it was one of the Tucker songs.

2343
02:52:25,385 --> 02:52:25,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

2344
02:52:26,206 --> 02:52:27,947
[SPEAKER_07]: MPQ has a suggestion in our chatroom.

2345
02:52:27,967 --> 02:52:31,111
[SPEAKER_07]: He says they hate them because the note charts are total bullshit!

2346
02:52:33,144 --> 02:52:33,685
[SPEAKER_07]: and Hal.

2347
02:52:34,045 --> 02:52:36,767
[SPEAKER_15]: But I actually like the Safari, the song.

2348
02:52:37,267 --> 02:52:38,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, the songs are great.

2349
02:52:38,548 --> 02:52:39,769
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, 2DX songs are sexy.

2350
02:52:39,789 --> 02:52:47,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Get On Beat Wildstyle makes me want to barf up, but... Although, sadly, I think like 5th, 6th, 7th for me was about the peak of 2DX music.

2351
02:52:47,596 --> 02:52:48,737
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't been so into new ones.

2352
02:52:48,997 --> 02:52:50,058
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's good stuff, though.

2353
02:52:50,478 --> 02:52:52,700
[SPEAKER_15]: I miss the 4th style booty dancers.

2354
02:52:53,981 --> 02:52:56,022
[SPEAKER_15]: We need more 4th style booty dancers.

2355
02:52:57,183 --> 02:53:00,266
[SPEAKER_15]: We need the chick in the bandana to come back and we need that weird looking guy.

2356
02:53:01,229 --> 02:53:07,251
[SPEAKER_07]: LXL Doobs also is asking, why didn't anybody have sex with the blow-up lamb that Jonas brought tonight?

2357
02:53:08,151 --> 02:53:09,952
[SPEAKER_15]: Because... Islanders going for it.

2358
02:53:10,032 --> 02:53:10,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Islanders going for it.

2359
02:53:12,193 --> 02:53:14,654
[SPEAKER_15]: Because some of us don't need to fake it.

2360
02:53:14,694 --> 02:53:15,854
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of us get it for real.

2361
02:53:16,674 --> 02:53:17,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh!

2362
02:53:17,855 --> 02:53:18,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh!

2363
02:53:19,675 --> 02:53:20,876
[SPEAKER_07]: You can quote her on that one.

2364
02:53:20,896 --> 02:53:21,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Islanders leaving.

2365
02:53:22,616 --> 02:53:23,797
[SPEAKER_27]: Officially violated.

2366
02:53:24,117 --> 02:53:24,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

2367
02:53:27,458 --> 02:53:27,858
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2368
02:53:31,189 --> 02:53:36,752
[SPEAKER_07]: You can still buy Pineapple Crush in the ghetto.

2369
02:53:57,555 --> 02:53:59,036
[SPEAKER_15]: Go down to Del Paso.

2370
02:53:59,096 --> 02:54:01,657
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to go because I miss Pineapple Crush.

2371
02:54:01,677 --> 02:54:02,177
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the best.

2372
02:54:02,497 --> 02:54:03,578
[SPEAKER_07]: I do still like Pineapple Crush.

2373
02:54:04,058 --> 02:54:05,439
[SPEAKER_07]: She says her favorite is Melon Soda.

2374
02:54:05,719 --> 02:54:08,881
[SPEAKER_07]: I am developing a fond likeness for Chocolate Soda, though.

2375
02:54:09,161 --> 02:54:09,541
[SPEAKER_15]: Ramune.

2376
02:54:10,609 --> 02:54:11,310
[SPEAKER_07]: www.DarkSakura.com

2377
02:54:27,706 --> 02:54:29,808
[SPEAKER_07]: about two years ago now.

2378
02:54:29,848 --> 02:54:30,329
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a while.

2379
02:54:30,369 --> 02:54:31,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn, it's really been that long.

2380
02:54:31,309 --> 02:54:32,691
[SPEAKER_07]: It was about two years ago I gave up soda.

2381
02:54:33,571 --> 02:54:35,653
[SPEAKER_07]: So pineapple's the only thing that would get me to drink regular soda.

2382
02:54:35,693 --> 02:54:36,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, I stick with pretty much diets.

2383
02:54:37,675 --> 02:54:40,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Diet cream soda is the best, though, because it tastes like regular cream soda.

2384
02:54:40,677 --> 02:54:41,078
[SPEAKER_07]: It really does.

2385
02:54:41,198 --> 02:54:42,299
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what I should do one day?

2386
02:54:42,979 --> 02:54:50,986
[SPEAKER_15]: Get some pineapple sugar-free Torani and some half-and-half and some soda water and make pineapple Italian cream soda.

2387
02:54:51,246 --> 02:54:51,807
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love you.

2388
02:54:52,608 --> 02:54:53,048
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love you.

2389
02:54:53,587 --> 02:54:55,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we got, oh, we only got a little bit of show left.

2390
02:54:55,708 --> 02:54:57,349
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to make sure we get some of these other questions here.

2391
02:54:57,910 --> 02:54:59,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Illusion, I think this is a good one here.

2392
02:55:00,712 --> 02:55:03,774
[SPEAKER_07]: What is your favorite memory of all time in this studio?

2393
02:55:06,195 --> 02:55:06,695
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll start.

2394
02:55:07,736 --> 02:55:10,218
[SPEAKER_07]: The night we got Karaoke Revolution and played it on air.

2395
02:55:12,259 --> 02:55:13,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, that was some funny shit.

2396
02:55:13,980 --> 02:55:14,480
[SPEAKER_07]: It really was.

2397
02:55:15,021 --> 02:55:16,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Favorite memory, yeah, Loki sighing.

2398
02:55:17,856 --> 02:55:19,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Favorite memory in the studio?

2399
02:55:19,218 --> 02:55:19,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody else have one?

2400
02:55:20,098 --> 02:55:25,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I would say a few weeks ago, just recently, we had the paparazzi in the studio.

2401
02:55:25,124 --> 02:55:25,805
[SPEAKER_07]: That was really cool.

2402
02:55:25,825 --> 02:55:27,747
[SPEAKER_15]: That was pretty cool, but they made me play DDR.

2403
02:55:27,787 --> 02:55:28,567
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, eh.

2404
02:55:29,328 --> 02:55:30,830
[SPEAKER_07]: And that article still hasn't run yet.

2405
02:55:30,870 --> 02:55:32,372
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been kind of waiting to see when that's going to show up.

2406
02:55:32,392 --> 02:55:33,172
[SPEAKER_15]: Towards the end of the month, though.

2407
02:55:33,192 --> 02:55:33,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Towards the end of the month?

2408
02:55:33,993 --> 02:55:35,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so we'll see when it shows up.

2409
02:55:35,615 --> 02:55:36,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully this week.

2410
02:55:36,956 --> 02:55:38,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Entire episode 69, that's all I've got to say.

2411
02:55:38,358 --> 02:55:39,459
[SPEAKER_07]: That was just messed up.

2412
02:55:39,479 --> 02:55:40,040
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't here.

2413
02:55:57,792 --> 02:56:00,414
[SPEAKER_07]: You heard episode 69 though, eventually, didn't you?

2414
02:56:00,474 --> 02:56:02,255
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I heard I'm staying in.

2415
02:56:02,675 --> 02:56:04,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean that was that whole karaoke revolution.

2416
02:56:04,916 --> 02:56:05,656
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean it was episode 69.

2417
02:56:06,617 --> 02:56:07,217
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you expect?

2418
02:56:08,238 --> 02:56:10,639
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I was in San Diego staying in the Gay Fry House.

2419
02:56:11,239 --> 02:56:12,040
[SPEAKER_07]: You were, you were.

2420
02:56:12,740 --> 02:56:14,241
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not going to have that much fun on the show again.

2421
02:56:14,261 --> 02:56:15,121
[SPEAKER_15]: In the Harry Potter closet.

2422
02:56:15,441 --> 02:56:19,063
[SPEAKER_07]: The next time we will have that much fun on the show will be either episode 187 or episode 420.

2423
02:56:19,103 --> 02:56:20,404
[SPEAKER_07]: If we make it that far.

2424
02:56:25,342 --> 02:56:26,023
[SPEAKER_15]: You know we will.

2425
02:56:26,543 --> 02:56:30,306
[SPEAKER_15]: We are here to stay because my ego will not let us quit.

2426
02:56:32,628 --> 02:56:40,634
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I think that I have fun every week, so every week is a shining star in my memory.

2427
02:56:43,997 --> 02:56:45,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Firebomba asked a follow-up question.

2428
02:56:45,918 --> 02:56:47,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I like Dr. Pepper, Cherry, Vanilla?

2429
02:56:48,861 --> 02:56:50,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, no, I do not.

2430
02:56:52,643 --> 02:56:53,965
[SPEAKER_15]: That was so my fault, but no.

2431
02:56:55,325 --> 02:56:57,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Pepper, it sounds great.

2432
02:56:57,747 --> 02:56:59,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Pepper, awesome.

2433
02:56:59,428 --> 02:57:00,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Cherry Soda, awesome.

2434
02:57:00,829 --> 02:57:01,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Vanilla, awesome.

2435
02:57:01,770 --> 02:57:02,430
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's diet.

2436
02:57:02,650 --> 02:57:07,133
[SPEAKER_15]: I warned you when I went to Alabama and tried that shit there because it wasn't out here yet.

2437
02:57:07,154 --> 02:57:09,195
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was like, okay, I'll try something new.

2438
02:57:09,875 --> 02:57:15,860
[SPEAKER_15]: I drank probably an ounce of my 20-ounce bottle and threw it away.

2439
02:57:16,340 --> 02:57:18,842
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't even pour it out because the poor plants would have died.

2440
02:57:20,825 --> 02:57:25,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Legend of Zaku wants to know, will the ferrets have their own bar and lovemaking pad in the new place?

2441
02:57:28,970 --> 02:57:32,453
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll try to think of something special for the ferrets, but we don't have any plans yet.

2442
02:57:33,473 --> 02:57:35,275
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that's the best answer I have for that, sorry.

2443
02:57:36,175 --> 02:57:44,341
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm so disappointed that my evil gateway to hell machine is so broken right now.

2444
02:57:45,521 --> 02:57:47,963
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell are you doing?

2445
02:57:49,867 --> 02:57:58,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, and Dark Knight, last question, the last Ask Orange Lounge question in this studio.

2446
02:57:58,594 --> 02:58:02,918
[SPEAKER_07]: I keep feeling like we're having a final episode of the whole thing, but we're really not.

2447
02:58:02,958 --> 02:58:16,689
[SPEAKER_07]: We are coming back, it's just going to be a new chapter, but the final Ask Orange Lounge of this studio is going to Dark Knight, and Dark Knight wants to know, Sky, can you take the webcam and show the studio one more time before the show ends?

2448
02:58:18,746 --> 02:58:20,708
[SPEAKER_15]: I took pictures.

2449
02:58:21,009 --> 02:58:23,211
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't have an FTP thing on here.

2450
02:58:23,651 --> 02:58:30,178
[SPEAKER_15]: If someone will let me email it, I will send it to somebody if they'll put it up on the thing for me.

2451
02:58:30,218 --> 02:58:33,021
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll make a gallery on Orange Lounge Radio.

2452
02:58:33,101 --> 02:58:34,563
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get Jamie's pictures and Melody's.

2453
02:58:34,623 --> 02:58:36,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh, I'm disconnected, I think.

2454
02:58:37,466 --> 02:58:38,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep going.

2455
02:58:38,347 --> 02:58:38,767
[SPEAKER_15]: No, you're there.

2456
02:58:38,827 --> 02:58:39,308
[SPEAKER_15]: You're still on.

2457
02:58:40,140 --> 02:58:41,181
[SPEAKER_15]: You were talking and it was still on.

2458
02:58:41,982 --> 02:58:42,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my headphones came out.

2459
02:58:42,903 --> 02:58:43,424
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what happened.

2460
02:58:44,064 --> 02:58:44,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

2461
02:58:46,667 --> 02:58:47,748
[SPEAKER_07]: His headphones turned gay!

2462
02:58:48,329 --> 02:58:48,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God!

2463
02:58:50,131 --> 02:58:50,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow!

2464
02:58:51,072 --> 02:58:56,197
[SPEAKER_03]: That right there is my favorite part of Orange Lodge Radio ever in the studio with his headphones turning gay.

2465
02:58:56,978 --> 02:58:57,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

2466
02:58:57,498 --> 02:58:57,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God!

2467
02:58:57,819 --> 02:58:59,240
[SPEAKER_07]: They're coming onto the mixing board!

2468
02:58:59,580 --> 02:58:59,941
Woo!

2469
02:59:00,582 --> 02:59:01,763
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, my headphones are back.

2470
02:59:01,803 --> 02:59:02,784
[SPEAKER_07]: The show sounds okay again.

2471
02:59:04,457 --> 02:59:07,099
[SPEAKER_07]: If you could take pictures too, because you've got a camera, and then we'll put them on our website.

2472
02:59:07,199 --> 02:59:07,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that would be great.

2473
02:59:08,699 --> 02:59:09,179
[SPEAKER_15]: The studio.

2474
02:59:09,199 --> 02:59:09,620
[SPEAKER_07]: The studio.

2475
02:59:10,040 --> 02:59:17,303
[SPEAKER_15]: And none of me, because I'm never... Okay, I'm going to take one picture after the show, but this is going to sound completely dirty.

2476
02:59:17,964 --> 02:59:19,144
[SPEAKER_15]: We all have to cram into the kitchen.

2477
02:59:19,964 --> 02:59:23,826
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I won't be in any pictures, because I'm not supposed to be.

2478
02:59:24,066 --> 02:59:25,867
[SPEAKER_15]: I am mysterious, goddammit.

2479
02:59:27,748 --> 02:59:29,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, anyway, so that's it.

2480
02:59:30,395 --> 02:59:32,339
[SPEAKER_07]: and thus is the end of episode 139.

2481
02:59:33,381 --> 02:59:36,928
[SPEAKER_07]: When we come back, season 6, episode 140.

2482
02:59:38,459 --> 02:59:39,439
[SPEAKER_07]: We are starting over.

2483
02:59:39,959 --> 02:59:42,200
[SPEAKER_07]: New studio, new sound for the station.

2484
02:59:42,800 --> 02:59:44,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Launch Radio, what gamers really want.

2485
02:59:44,941 --> 02:59:48,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Should I be disturbed that Jonas can put his entire fist in his mouth?

2486
02:59:49,302 --> 02:59:50,522
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

2487
02:59:51,282 --> 02:59:54,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, to end the show on a sappy note, thank you guys to the listeners.

2488
02:59:56,223 --> 02:59:57,324
[SPEAKER_07]: We do this because of you guys.

2489
02:59:57,784 --> 02:59:59,864
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys rock, honestly.

2490
03:00:00,244 --> 03:00:02,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of you guys have been supporting the station since episode one.

2491
03:00:03,625 --> 03:00:06,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of you guys, I know, like, just there's folks that have been listening since episode one.

2492
03:00:06,587 --> 03:00:07,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of you guys haven't been listening.

2493
03:00:08,229 --> 03:00:11,611
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of guys didn't come on board until, remember when we had the Uran premiere?

2494
03:00:11,651 --> 03:00:13,132
[SPEAKER_07]: We got a lot of new people that night.

2495
03:00:13,372 --> 03:00:14,193
[SPEAKER_07]: That was very awesome.

2496
03:00:14,213 --> 03:00:18,136
[SPEAKER_07]: So thanks again to Mel B for helping hook us up with that.

2497
03:00:18,176 --> 03:00:19,637
[SPEAKER_15]: You totally pimped our ride.

2498
03:00:19,717 --> 03:00:20,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Miklatov.

2499
03:00:22,059 --> 03:00:23,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Miklatov as well.

2500
03:00:23,119 --> 03:00:23,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn right.

2501
03:00:23,840 --> 03:00:25,241
[SPEAKER_07]: That really expanded our fan base.

2502
03:00:25,859 --> 03:00:34,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Big thank you to DDR Freak Radio, who we've been doing more work with in the past year, showing that two stations with similar interests can work together for the common good.

2503
03:00:35,245 --> 03:00:44,131
[SPEAKER_07]: And also a big thank you to Under Sedation Live, for which none of this, if Under Sedation Live did not exist, probably none of this would exist either.

2504
03:00:44,211 --> 03:00:45,192
[SPEAKER_14]: We love you.

2505
03:00:45,272 --> 03:00:47,754
[SPEAKER_07]: So, anything else?

2506
03:00:48,194 --> 03:00:51,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Since we're not going to get to do an acceptance speech at the Best of Awards, probably.

2507
03:00:51,496 --> 03:00:52,837
[SPEAKER_06]: This world is bullshit!

2508
03:00:54,018 --> 03:00:55,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Go with yourself, just go with yourself.

2509
03:01:01,421 --> 03:01:03,282
[SPEAKER_07]: We will be here next week with a show.

2510
03:01:03,342 --> 03:01:06,223
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll just be a tape show, but it'll be kind of a bookend show.

2511
03:01:06,263 --> 03:01:07,883
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll just be something to tie this week together.

2512
03:01:08,464 --> 03:01:10,984
[SPEAKER_07]: In two weeks, May 1st, Orange Lounge Radio version 2.0.

2513
03:01:12,205 --> 03:01:13,325
[SPEAKER_07]: What gamers really want to know.

2514
03:01:16,486 --> 03:01:18,307
[SPEAKER_07]: And now, final thoughts.

2515
03:01:18,547 --> 03:01:20,668
[SPEAKER_07]: And Mel B, you've got the mic, so you've got to start us off, buddy.

2516
03:01:22,387 --> 03:01:22,867
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, man.

2517
03:01:22,967 --> 03:01:28,230
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, I just hope that in this next place that we have, we'll actually have some furniture set up.

2518
03:01:29,070 --> 03:01:36,094
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what sucks is the next studio is actually smaller, but it's just for, like, computers and Orange Lounge, so that's kind of the trade-off.

2519
03:01:36,474 --> 03:01:41,016
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know, it was a lot more fun at the old house where we all had to be on top of each other.

2520
03:01:41,036 --> 03:01:41,917
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be that again.

2521
03:01:41,977 --> 03:01:42,697
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be that again.

2522
03:01:43,197 --> 03:01:46,319
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, just for that, you've got to, like, mount some twister mats on the bottom of the floor.

2523
03:01:46,539 --> 03:01:48,040
[SPEAKER_07]: But with better ventilation.

2524
03:01:49,794 --> 03:01:51,577
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a window right there.

2525
03:01:51,657 --> 03:01:52,257
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be nice.

2526
03:01:52,598 --> 03:01:56,823
[SPEAKER_27]: But yeah, for going five seasons strong, I got to say, man, this is a pretty cool setup.

2527
03:01:57,043 --> 03:02:02,229
[SPEAKER_27]: And I mean, on behalf of DDR Spot, I want to give you lots of props for keeping this thing going.

2528
03:02:02,842 --> 03:02:05,344
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, you probably do a hell of a lot better than we do on the upkeep.

2529
03:02:05,384 --> 03:02:13,509
[SPEAKER_27]: But hey, anything we can do, like they say, as far as from Spot's standpoint, if we can't win the race, we'll help the people in front of us break the record.

2530
03:02:14,170 --> 03:02:14,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, buddy.

2531
03:02:14,650 --> 03:02:15,230
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate that.

2532
03:02:15,250 --> 03:02:15,711
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

2533
03:02:15,731 --> 03:02:16,031
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

2534
03:02:16,051 --> 03:02:16,691
[SPEAKER_07]: That's so sweet.

2535
03:02:16,771 --> 03:02:21,214
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, Mel has not only done a lot for the station, but he's also helped me out a lot personally as well.

2536
03:02:21,274 --> 03:02:22,595
[SPEAKER_15]: He did our first promo.

2537
03:02:22,896 --> 03:02:23,236
[SPEAKER_07]: He did.

2538
03:02:23,556 --> 03:02:24,817
[SPEAKER_07]: He was our first celebrity promo.

2539
03:02:24,837 --> 03:02:27,899
[SPEAKER_15]: And we've been running that promo ever since.

2540
03:02:28,199 --> 03:02:29,640
[SPEAKER_07]: He's our first celebrity promo.

2541
03:02:30,681 --> 03:02:30,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

2542
03:02:31,610 --> 03:02:32,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Sharks Girl, final thought.

2543
03:02:33,451 --> 03:02:41,818
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, it's been fun in here, and when I heard you guys were doing the last show in this studio and I had nothing to do, I was like, I have to go up there just to harass them.

2544
03:02:41,858 --> 03:02:44,100
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not going to tell anybody I'm showing up.

2545
03:02:45,401 --> 03:02:50,264
[SPEAKER_07]: You've been a very frequent guest that has to drive a long way to get here, and we appreciate that.

2546
03:02:50,284 --> 03:02:51,405
[SPEAKER_07]: About two hours at a time.

2547
03:02:51,445 --> 03:02:52,786
[SPEAKER_07]: That is hella dedication.

2548
03:02:52,826 --> 03:02:54,147
[SPEAKER_07]: We totally appreciate that, Sharks Girl.

2549
03:02:54,167 --> 03:03:00,492
[SPEAKER_16]: It's always, always fun, and just hoping to best wishes for the new studio and as many good memories there are as we've had here.

2550
03:03:01,334 --> 03:03:01,614
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2551
03:03:01,974 --> 03:03:03,395
[SPEAKER_05]: And Jonas.

2552
03:03:04,455 --> 03:03:04,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Jonas.

2553
03:03:07,196 --> 03:03:09,916
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, it's been one hell of a ride, I got to say.

2554
03:03:10,076 --> 03:03:12,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, you do know, no show next week, right?

2555
03:03:12,817 --> 03:03:13,837
[SPEAKER_07]: So don't come here.

2556
03:03:13,957 --> 03:03:15,758
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to be busy anyway, so.

2557
03:03:15,918 --> 03:03:17,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

2558
03:03:17,198 --> 03:03:18,719
[SPEAKER_24]: Bitch is not a eulogy.

2559
03:03:20,839 --> 03:03:26,141
[SPEAKER_28]: But anyway, I'm hoping the new move will be a great move and stuff, and hopefully things turn out pretty well.

2560
03:03:27,181 --> 03:03:30,682
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm looking forward to see the next Orange Lounge, the next week for Orange Lounge Radio.

2561
03:03:31,127 --> 03:03:31,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Angel

2562
03:04:00,295 --> 03:04:29,584
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I haven't been listening since episode 1, I have been listening since episode 26 Been good times since then, been good times at this place And hope to continue it when we get to the new studio Good times to come, here we go Loki I'll be honest, this studio is a big hole Okay, the whole apartment is falling apart I mean, there's mold in my room I mean, the window's falling off The peephole goddamn shot out at me today Well, no, not today, but the other day

2563
03:04:30,199 --> 03:04:31,600
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, you want me to go?

2564
03:04:59,842 --> 03:05:01,691
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a request to hear the grudge sound real fast.

2565
03:05:05,049 --> 03:05:06,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2566
03:05:06,450 --> 03:05:08,391
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm going to have to show this to you.

2567
03:05:08,471 --> 03:05:15,036
[SPEAKER_07]: In the new place, in my new roommate, who, by the way, has never been on this show and has no idea what to expect, my new roommate.

2568
03:05:15,817 --> 03:05:16,497
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a gamer, though.

2569
03:05:16,517 --> 03:05:17,438
[SPEAKER_07]: He likes Donkey Konga.

2570
03:05:17,638 --> 03:05:18,339
[SPEAKER_07]: He loves that game.

2571
03:05:18,899 --> 03:05:19,619
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll see what happens.

2572
03:05:19,960 --> 03:05:20,480
[SPEAKER_07]: My new roommate.

2573
03:05:21,281 --> 03:05:23,442
[SPEAKER_07]: In his bedroom, he has the master bedroom in the new place.

2574
03:05:23,742 --> 03:05:27,925
[SPEAKER_07]: In his bedroom, there's actually a little cutout that goes to the attic type thing.

2575
03:05:28,406 --> 03:05:29,486
[SPEAKER_07]: And I did that the other night.

2576
03:05:29,547 --> 03:05:30,968
[SPEAKER_07]: I started going, uh.

2577
03:05:31,088 --> 03:05:32,188
[SPEAKER_07]: And now he says he can't sleep.

2578
03:05:32,208 --> 03:05:32,629
[SPEAKER_15]: You know...

2579
03:05:34,190 --> 03:05:42,297
[SPEAKER_15]: One of Dan's assistant managers at GameStop said that that sound is made by the vocal cords that control your high pitch and your low pitch.

2580
03:05:42,757 --> 03:05:46,000
[SPEAKER_15]: That if you can make that noise, it means you have a very good vocal capacity.

2581
03:05:47,801 --> 03:05:49,242
[SPEAKER_15]: Still ain't gonna get me to sing karaoke.

2582
03:05:49,923 --> 03:05:55,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, my final thought is, again guys, I know this is sounding like a last show, but it is not over.

2583
03:05:55,748 --> 03:05:57,209
[SPEAKER_07]: We are starting over.

2584
03:05:59,572 --> 03:06:01,933
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to go with what I've been going with lately.

2585
03:06:02,113 --> 03:06:03,274
[SPEAKER_15]: Reject false icons.

2586
03:06:03,374 --> 03:06:04,194
[SPEAKER_15]: Think for yourself.

2587
03:06:04,234 --> 03:06:05,034
[SPEAKER_15]: Decide what you like.

2588
03:06:05,835 --> 03:06:06,135
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2589
03:06:07,295 --> 03:06:07,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Islander?

2590
03:06:11,097 --> 03:06:12,717
