1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Zomato 1999

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,500
I'm Miho Hattori, straight out the purgatory

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,000
Ai ai already, I'm passing your rate

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,500
Don't be snob with me

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,000
No aioli, children of Moby

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,500
Obi Wan Kenobi told me in the lobby

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,000
Technically, I'm dre and I can find a key

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,500
There's a wall on Broadway

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,000
No control, it's in my way

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,500
I feel so gone with my song

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,000
I got no respect for this game

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
There's a whole long road way

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Nothing wrong, it's in my way

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I feel so wrong, where do I go?

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I've got no reason for this game

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Our name is stereotype with a name

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I've got to get the shit straight

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Can you relate? My mate, don't be late

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
My gate is open, downtown still sends me up in the sky

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
There's a whole long road way

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Nothing wrong, it's in my way

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,800
I feel so alone, wheres my soul?

23
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,900
I got no respect for this game

24
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,560
They're the hombres, stairs

25
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,800
You know the drum is in my way

26
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,460
I feel so alone, wheres my soul?

27
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,640
I got no respect for this game

28
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,560
They're the hombres, stairs

29
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,740
You know the drum is in my way

30
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,040
I feel so alone, wheres my soul?

31
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,580
I got no respect for this game

32
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,660
They're the hombres, stairs

33
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,320
You know the drum is in my way

34
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,320
I feel so good with my soul I got no reason for this game

35
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:03,320
Orange Lounge Radio is presented in the TMI sound format.

36
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:33,320
You're mentioning the old mad radium line, the body of radium, so much so that you can

37
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,820
Whoa!

38
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,820
Oh, God!

39
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,320

Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

43
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,320
Orange Lounge may contain plenty of...

44
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,820
...bluh...uh...bluh...cocky.

45
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:27,820
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that. In this episode...

46
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,820
Well isn't that special?

47
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:44,820
Orange Lounge Radio Live is a fully interactive program via our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com

48
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:52,820
And now, here are your hosts for Orange Lounge Radio Live, Dark Sakura, Skye and Loki.

49
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,820
We are live!

50
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:05,820
This is episode number 139 for this April 17th of 2005.

51
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:12,820
You're tuned into the B-Mani scene's most empty radio station of all things B-Mani.

52
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,820
My name is Rob Roberts, if you might know me as Sky.

53
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,620
Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the

54
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,620
farm.

55
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,340
Say hello to Ms. Jamie Summers, you know her better as Dark Sakura.

56
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,620
I am the titanium chef.

57
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,060
You're better than an iron chef, you're the titanium chef.

58
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,020
And I'm an internet celebrity.

59
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,680
Yes you are, alright.

60
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,820
And also with us tonight, say hello to Loki.

61
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,820
Hi, I'm here.

62
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,820
Alright.

63
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,820
And also with us tonight, our regular guest, DDR Angel.

64
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,820
Yay, I'm regular?

65
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,820
Uh, yeah.

66
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,820
Anyway, yes, so I...

67
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,820
I don't know, that's a personal question, honey, I can't answer that.

68
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,820
Shut up.

69
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,820
I'm sure she keeps up with plenty of fiber.

70
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:01,820
Alright, also joining us tonight, we have another special guest who just walked into the studio here.

71
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:10,820
Say hello to our resident, I don't know, he's our resident, we need a title for him, I don't know.

72
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,820
Pepsi bringer.

73
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,820
Okay, Pepsi bringer.

74
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:19,820
And he's a mod over on, oh no, a staff member over on the DDR Freak and a well-known community member, long-time player.

75
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,820
Say hello to Islander.

76
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,820
Hello.

77
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,820
How you doing, sir?

78
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,820
I am doing just fine yourself.

79
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:29,240
just find yourself good I am a little sad though because as you have heard the

80
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:36,920
rumors are true tonight is the last episode of orange lounge radio from this

81
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:44,860
studio so I'm gonna say all the more reason I'm here but all right so yeah

82
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:52,020
we're we are starting over actually this is yeah actually that's that's kind of

83
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,380
That's a good way of putting it.

84
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,380
With wires everywhere.

85
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,380
Except with a lot more technology.

86
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:31,460
And a hidden stash of heroin in Loki's room.

87
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,900
My room literally has a pile of crap on top of the bed.

88
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:40,940
It's just like this giant pile of clothes and records and god who knows what.

89
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:45,820
I instantly was, I knew better because I've actually known someone who has a pile of real

90
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:49,420
crap on his bed from his cat.

91
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,420
It was very gross.

92
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,420
Really?

93
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,020
friend of mine's ex-boyfriend.

94
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:58,780
Anyway, so our webcam tonight, unfortunately, because of the move going on, we're actually

95
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:03,060
missing... the arcade cabinet is no longer here in the studio, the couch is no longer

96
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,260
here in the studio.

97
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,140
We tried to hook up the Shamu Cam.

98
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,900
It was the coffee table.

99
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:13,300
So we're... there's no computer to run a webcam, I think... the PlayStation 2's not even here

100
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,300
anymore.

101
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:20,300
My computer is, um, in the, um, the kitchen, for some reason.

102
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:25,300
It's toasting something, apparently. I don't know.

103
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,300
My other computer is over here next to the chair.

104
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,300
It's an Amiga suddenly, and it wants toast.

105
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,300
The metal dance pads are in the bathroom.

106
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,300
The metal dance... I went in to take a shower today, and I'm like, what the fuck?

107
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,300
There's a dance pad on the floor.

108
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,300
It's a mess.

109
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,420
So we would love to show this to you guys on webcam, but we have no way to do it.

110
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,420
Yes we do.

111
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:50,860
I have the transfer cable and my telephone.

112
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:56,820
Okay, so maybe we'll figure something out, but for now...

113
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,180
I really am too lazy to do that.

114
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:05,380
For now, we're patching in the Sacramento webcam, so you can see the town where we live.

115
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:10,540
All I need is an STP program or someone to put it up on somewhere for me.

116
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,540
But I'll take pictures with my cell phone.

117
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,540
Okay, maybe we could do something.

118
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,540
Talk to Jason in our chat, our webmaster. Maybe we could set something up.

119
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,540
I will after I eat dinner.

120
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,540
Alright, anyway.

121
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:28,540
So, big thanks to news10.net, who we are stealing the Sacramento webcam from, completely and utterly without permission.

122
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:33,540
So, I hope, I figure if I work in that free plug.

123
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,540
Yes, watch Desperate How's What?

124
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,540
Actually don't, because that's on right now.

125
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:47,540
What other shows are on ABC? Watch Lost, Wednesday night at some time on News 10.

126
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,540
Unless you're not in Sacramento, then I guess you're screwed.

127
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,540
Followed by Temple of Butt.

128
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,540
Alright.

129
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,540
Yes, watch The Bachelorette because nobody else is.

130
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,540
Speaking of Temple of Butt...

131
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,540
Alright, we'll be back after this.

132
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,460
This is a live webcam of Sacramento.

133
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,780
The chair is going, is that live?

134
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,660
Yes, it is a live shot of Sacramento.

135
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,360
It's only 6.30 here, so it's still bright.

136
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,740
Anyway, we gotta take a break.

137
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,580
That's all right.

138
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,020
They don't realize we pre-record the webcam.

139
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,380
We'll be back after this break

140
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,280
featuring Bahmani songs with numbers in them.

141
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,000
After this.

142
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,660
One, two, three, four, five, six.

143
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,580
Whoa, whoa!

144
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:45,960
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!

145
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:34,740
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,

146
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,740
I'm trying to make you know it's true

147
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:14,920
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

148
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,780
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and I gotta say, we got surprised there during

149
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,300
the break.

150
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:27,980
Joining us for the very last episode of Orange Lounge Radio, from the studio, is Mel B.

151
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,980
Supplies!

152
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:29,980
What's up?

153
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:30,980
How you doing?

154
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,980
How you doin'?

155
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:37,980
Oh man, all is good in the world, all is good.

156
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,980
Sounds good.

157
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,980
For the most part.

158
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,980
For the most part.

159
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,980
That's why we have FUs lately.

160
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,980
Well yeah, we'll hear about the other half during FUs.

161
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,980
And also joining us, of course, where there's Mel B, there's Sharks Girl.

162
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,980
Hi guys.

163
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,980
How you doin' hun?

164
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,980
I brought Lumines for you to ogle.

165
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,980
He actually has it too, I've already played it.

166
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,980
But you guys should do the wireless thing, that might be fun.

167
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,980
Okay, at least you're not going to be like obsessing over me just for my PSP.

168
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,220
You have to tell that story on the air because it's too funny.

169
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,700
I'll make you tell that later.

170
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,500
So um, you should go check out his games, he's got quite a few.

171
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,500
So anyway.

172
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,980
Cool, because I only have like two and I never play any of them except like-

173
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,980
Dude!

174
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,980
Is that a-

175
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,980
Oh my god!

176
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,820
What the hell, is that a Genesis portable thing?

177
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,820
A Nomad.

178
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,820
A Nomad?

179
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,820
I have one of those too.

180
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,120
and you know that you can use the uh... the game gear power uh...

181
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,460
battery pack on this too

182
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:32,940
this is like portable gaming convention in the tsunami zone tonight here

183
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,840
all right i'm just taking out moonwalker on the nomad and all i gotta say is man

184
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,180
in times like these

185
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:45,180
who better you know of a superhero den like psychotic pedophile

186
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,140
anyway

187
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,580
in that break

188
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:55,140
that break we heard Jesper Kidd with the Tengoku remix or as some folks call it

189
00:16:55,140 --> 00:17:02,080
dot five nine before that Akira Yomoka 250 BPM before that DJ Naguro Lin

190
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:07,220
1999 and starting that set off DJ Simon three two one stars all songs with

191
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:11,100
numbers in them that break because we're just stretching for themes tonight

192
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:17,700
anyway this is the final night here in this studio we're going to be moving to

193
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:22,500
a brand new studio in the next town over Rancho Cambodia or I'm sorry Rancho

194
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:30,300
Cordova so actually the nice thing about the new studio I've actually finally I

195
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,960
got the keys to the new place so I actually checked out the new studio it's

196
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,080
kind of comparable to what we had when we first started this show what we had

197
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,740
episodes what about one through retro yeah so it's it's its own room but that

198
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,740
means we get to decorate it however we want stuff so it's gonna be kind of cool

199
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:51,700
so look forward to that in future episodes and future webcams. Again, though, the webcam

200
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:57,860
tonight, not working. Instead, we've patched through the Channel 10's Sacramento webcam,

201
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:03,700
so you can just check out the river. Did you really? I was there earlier today. And watch

202
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:10,340
it slowly get darker. Wow. Yeah, I know, isn't it fascinating? It's about as exciting as

203
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:15,580
our usual webcam when there's no guests here, so, where you get to watch the couch all night.

204
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:23,600
and then you can see it slowly get darker outside anyway since we won't be

205
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,960
in this new studio technically for two weeks we are not going to be here next

206
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:33,040
week we are going to run a pre tape show though we're gonna be partying next week

207
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,400
so there will be a new episode of orange on its radio but it will be kind of

208
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,320
different it's going to be kind of the way for us to kind of close the chapter

209
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:45,880
on this because really what's happening is that we're kind of as I said the

210
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:51,600
theme is we are starting over so what's happening new yes we are actually kind

211
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,660
of closing the chapter on this section of orange launch radio when we come back

212
00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:00,800
on the Sunday in two weeks everything's going to be different the music you hear

213
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,360
on the station is going to be completely different as well so that's going to be

214
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:10,360
May 1st everything kind of going on orange lounge radio what gamers really

215
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,880
want to know it's kind of our new little mantra so stay tuned for that that's

216
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,760
coming to you guys may 1st when we come back with orange lounge 140 but hey that

217
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,760
doesn't mean we don't have anything for you guys tonight we got a fun show

218
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,120
started off of course with the ever popular how was your week how was your

219
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,260
day dark Sakura how was your week how was day my week was a lot of work and a

220
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:35,120
lot of going to the gym and a lot of school I finished my retarded color

221
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:41,720
wheel pictures of it abound on the internet it's just really been a whole

222
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,560
bunch of nothing I didn't get to play any Silent Hill which I'm kind of

223
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:51,360
disappointed about although I did play Lego Star Wars on Xbox which was

224
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,760
actually pretty funny and you can play as General Grievous from the next movie

225
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,940
is it worth the buy just to laugh at it's entertaining but kind of

226
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,800
frustrating it I would recommend it to kids except there's a couple of hard

227
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:10,800
levels it's still kind of kind of funny thing seeing a Lego mace the only reason

228
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,200
I wanted to interrupt and ask is because my friend actually bought me Lego racers

229
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:22,640
on the old 64 and that was pretty funny this one's just funny um but yesterday I

230
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:30,720
hung out with Julie all day shopping ooh Trader Joe's girls going shopping who

231
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:40,780
would have thought oh hey girls gone shopping we did make fun of Paris Hilton

232
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:49,920
a lot that's hot and I thought there was this girl who we were at the J Street

233
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:54,100
Mall today and there's this girl who was absolutely flooded up wearing one of

234
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:58,460
those little skirts that look like you know a lampshade cover and this halter

235
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:03,900
And I wanted to stop her and ask her to say I'm doing interviews of prostitutes. What's it like living on the street?

236
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,540
But I didn't feel too bitchy

237
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:16,340
Because I had first because I had lunch at hard rock cafe. Okay. Do they have the Guinness Burger?

238
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:21,780
They haven't given us buttons are made with Guinness. It's awesome. I

239
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,180
Was like carbs. Yay. I'm gonna eat

240
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:38,180
The buns are made with Guinness, and oh, Thursday, because there was no karaoke because someone decided to google something.

241
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,180
Sorry.

242
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:43,180
I went to Streets of London and had fish and chips in Guinness.

243
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,180
No, that's fun.

244
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,180
That made me happy, and they had real football on TV.

245
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,180
That's right.

246
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:51,180
Streets of London is like, I'm sure every big town has something like this.

247
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,180
It's a British import pub, basically.

248
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,180
It is a pub.

249
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:59,500
Yeah, they've basically, they've kind of taken it on a giant, uh, crane and craned it over

250
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,860
here to the United States and set it down in major cities.

251
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:07,260
And you can actually order cheeps the way they should be, the potatoes, you know, and

252
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,220
then you get to watch rugby and real football on the TV.

253
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,380
Real football because American football is crap!

254
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:18,380
I'm sorry, rugby is what you need to be watching because those men get bloody, you know, without

255
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:23,260
they have padding on their head and that's about it, you know, because they have to,

256
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:29,980
know have fun you know brain function not like what's-her-face anyway I went

257
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:34,540
to the Crocker Museum today just to look at stuff because I had to do it for my

258
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:38,220
art class there's some pretty cool stuff now what is what is the Crocker Museum

259
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:42,380
for those not in the area it's an art museum downtown Zach in this really old

260
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:46,300
house but made me think of a lot of the old houses in downtown mobile so sort of

261
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:51,740
like whoa this is cool so kind of a Victorian style house kind of like it

262
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,700
It was just, the house itself was awesome.

263
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,500
They had a gallery for this Japanese artist there

264
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,700
who did a lot of the representations

265
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,780
of the kabuki actors.

266
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,600
Very cool.

267
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,740
It's pretty cool.

268
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,540
And then did things on the Genji story.

269
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,300
It was pretty cool.

270
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:14,060
And then I went to this one exhibit though.

271
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,100
I swear the sculptures in that

272
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,860
were like right out of Silent Hill.

273
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:21,740
I was like, this is pretty awesome.

274
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:26,820
And then I had to pick a picture that I really, really liked and then I had to pick

275
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:31,260
something that I hated and say why I hated it. And the one I picked that I hated

276
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,500
was called, uh,

277
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,580
like, Angels a la Mode or something.

278
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:40,980
It was this ceramic, shiny lady with this big, poofy hair and little angels hanging

279
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,540
all over.

280
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:47,020
I was like, this is ugly. That is a really odd comment to come back in. I just start hearing

281
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:56,020
about a ceramic lady with angels. I went to the museum today and then there's a

282
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:59,740
picture that I really liked when you walk into the gallery it's humongous it

283
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:05,020
takes up almost this whole piece of wall it's this old man who sort of looks like

284
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:09,340
Patrick Stewart sort of but really you know shaggy beard shaggy hair laying down

285
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:15,400
like he's dying but he looks really aware of himself but as you approach the

286
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:20,680
picture sounds kind of erotic there's these pastel figures all scattered about

287
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:25,960
it and for a moment I thought that this might be it's called a glee K which is

288
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:30,320
a G clay that's what it's called which is a digital in a movie with Ben Affleck

289
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:38,980
and Jennifer Lopez and G play just easy but what what that is is a digital image

290
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:44,600
that's transferred to canvas and this was actually all done in acrylics on

291
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,960
canvas on this massive canvas that took him something like five years to

292
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:52,220
complete and I was really impressed with that picture I took a picture of it

293
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:56,180
though I wasn't supposed to but I did it was really cool but it was called a

294
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:59,000
portrait of my father as well as called I'll find I'll get the name and

295
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,120
everything those really cool picture and for me I was like oh I feel all artsy

296
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:09,320
fartsy this is cool and then they had an exhibit of African artifacts including

297
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:17,480
some cool axes and everything it was really awesome I had a nerd day your

298
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,080
laundry is going crazy yeah I better go rescue my laundry from your machine is

299
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:29,640
the washer walking off I quit I guess so I don't know what happened there anyway

300
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,640
wow that's the first okay anyway moving on with how's your week how's your day

301
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:39,280
so hopefully if dark Sakura can get some pictures of her artistic day she can

302
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,800
post those up on the forums and you guys can check that out. Alright, uh, moving on with

303
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,720
How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day. Let's just go, uh, Sharks Girl, you got a mic next

304
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:53,480
to you, why not? What's up? Okay. Well, obviously my day involved coming here, just for the

305
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:57,160
heck of it. I was like, yesterday I'm like, it's the last episode of Orange Lounge in

306
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:05,280
that studio. You wanna go? And that was that. Very cool. I decided. So, I got a new job.

307
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:22,280
My new job is really quite nice. It's a temp for a few months, so I get paid weekly, which is nifty, and it's nice to work at a place where you don't feel like everyone's going to backstab you at any given second, and you actually enjoy working with your coworkers, so I've been very mellow lately, so that's a good thing.

308
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,280
That's good, that's good.

309
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,280
Yeah, so I'm kind of boring, but that's okay.

310
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,280
No, that's alright. New jobs are fun.

311
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,280
And new jobs with lots of money are fun, too.

312
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,280
Yes, they are. Yes, sir.

313
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,280
Anything else? Any gaming stuff?

314
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:39,480
I've just been playing like luminous and I alternate between luminous on the PSP and zookeeper on DS and

315
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,500
What now you and Loki outside was he showing you how to hack your PSP?

316
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,940
Is that what he was doing outside trying to hack into the neighbors wireless internet?

317
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,560
It was not only tried it was succeeded do you have wipeout on your

318
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,900
Okay, so learning from the best I guess

319
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:06,900
So now you can, you know, drive around the neighborhood and see what wireless internet you can hack into.

320
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:11,900
Well, I have wireless at my house, so if I'm feeling lazy and just don't want to get on my laptop, you know, there you go.

321
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:18,900
There you go. Absolutely. All right. Moving on, Mel. Mr. Mel B. How was your week? How was your day?

322
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:29,900
The week was pretty interesting. I actually started a new job myself on Monday, working as an editor at this one place that actually does a lot of assessment and standards for kids.

323
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,200
for kids alike

324
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,600
great five through eleven i'd be

325
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,180
basically editing and printing a bunch of uh... assessment

326
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,960
something like the tbs at the key type stuff

327
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,480
so it's kind of uh... cool job to get paid you know the good amount of money

328
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,000
to tell people they're wrong

329
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,520
you know but i thought

330
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,320
you know it nothing to keep you just yell for a job application for the back

331
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,440
of that

332
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,240
i'm sorry you know

333
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,260
uh...

334
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:00,880
for those who didn't hear that jamie said i'll do that for free

335
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,720
well yeah it's it's it's good times aside from the commute being in like san

336
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,960
francisco and i'm in like redwood city it's about like half hour plus parking

337
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,720
in

338
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,560
the city and always that great but it's all good but uh... get a nice view it

339
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,960
everything is pretty cool i mean it's like one of those kickback jobs like

340
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,800
it's eight hours but i get my stuff done by one o'clock and then i try to go to

341
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,600
my bosses office to find something you know like what to do

342
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,800
she stuck in meetings to like four o'clock so i got three hours of dead

343
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:29,080
time so you know it's it's all good I get to listen to orange lounge all day

344
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:38,440
so hey all right you know so I'm feeling that um other crazy stuff actually it

345
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,320
was funny was something mentioned on I guess it was yeah DDR freak a couple

346
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,840
weeks ago someone had put up like an unofficial like top 50 freestyle

347
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:51,040
routines of all time in like North America and me and my boys like we

348
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,200
started coming up with this idea like maybe we should get a couple people like

349
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,660
all together get some ideas around we actually want to put up a list of like

350
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:02,340
top 100 free no freestyles of like North American history like coming from a

351
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:06,620
freestyle perspective coming from like someone who's just an avid fan and it's

352
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:10,420
something that we're gonna do like probably in a month or two I got it

353
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:16,580
right now the first annual DDR freestyle history I don't know they can do some

354
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:21,540
sort of like award show for that you know have best improv routine well just

355
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:26,180
I love the freestyle and get how far we'll get no, thank you. That was my idea

356
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:30,900
We'll get how sparks to comment on everything. I mean, yeah, well, I mean we can start it off in like 1999

357
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:37,440
And then we can go through every year who the big names were in 2000 2001 all the way till now

358
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:44,800
You're like yo 2001 head slaps and knee drops. Yo, that was ill man. That was the greatest post 18 videos

359
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:50,420
You know, I was actually considering walking around with my turn Orochi

360
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,780
she uh...

361
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:57,100
like own heart

362
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,300
while

363
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,020
uh... but it's just some stuff like that and we actually want to

364
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,680
do something with spot sometime we can actually get like

365
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:07,180
our database back in the house of the spot is going to be working again

366
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:10,660
yeah i don't think it's like our webmaster you know that i have a back

367
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:14,480
end of the china right now so

368
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,660
yeah uh... if he's not that sucks when your website goes to china that that

369
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,820
that's uh... no fun at all

370
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,140
uh... but you know we want to do something like that we actually want to get videos back up and all

371
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,440
that kind of stuff it's like

372
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,100
there's a lot of people they've only seen stuff maybe two thousand two two

373
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,780
thousand five you know it's

374
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:33,660
it'd just be some because there's really nothing better to do

375
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,820
i mean

376
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:39,340
since there's no new arcade mixes or anything we'll just reminisce about old arcade mixes

377
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:43,700
yeah we you know the longer longer we lived the more we remember DDR used to

378
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,260
be good

379
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:50,580
uh... but uh... speaking of that uh... actually also posted up a article

380
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,880
uh... if this is not what i think it is or talk about is more detail later

381
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,100

383
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,820

00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,940
it's all good it's the price of fame

399
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,460
it'll be even more interesting to see how many people get with me when they

400
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:01,820
feel the media passing can get fun goodies

401
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:04,740

00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:02,180
maybe seven hours

428
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,940
and uh...

429
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,540
aside from that not really a whole lot of too much

430
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,380
uh...

431
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:12,680
I actually went and played P.I.U. today for the first time in, like, ages.

432
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:16,380
And to the non-hipsters, that's Pump It Up. P.I.U., Pump It Up.

433
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,380
Cat 49! Cat 49!

434
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,380
Yes, and I actually did play that song, actually.

435
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:26,380
But yeah, it was just pretty interesting just to go to a place that had video games,

436
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,380
and you put a dollar in the machine, and it actually gave out quarters!

437
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,380
It's like, wow! It's like, I'd use it somewhere else!

438
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:37,380
I can get laundry money from a pump-it-up machine?

439
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,380
Yeah, really.

440
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,380
It was hot.

441
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,380
You don't know.

442
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,380
No idea.

443
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,380
But no.

444
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,380
Let's see.

445
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,380
Ooh.

446
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,380
I went to the Nio's.

447
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,380
Walked around for a bit.

448
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,380
I found, like, the greatest Eddie Guerrero shirt.

449
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,380
Really?

450
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,380
It had, like, pictures in San Andreas style and it said, license is still.

451
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,380
I see that.

452
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,380
I see that.

453
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,380
I still don't want to cry.

454
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,380
Picked that one up.

455
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,380
Nice.

456
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,380
But, yeah.

457
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,380
That's pretty much it.

458
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,380
All right.

459
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,380
Loki, how was your week? How was your day?

460
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:10,380
It was hell. It was all hell. It sucked. This entire week sucked.

461
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:17,380
And I started off with, I got, okay, first I started my new job, game sales. That's all good, you know, starting the training stuff.

462
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:28,380
And, you know, it's just grueling. It's just very, they're having me, I'm fighting with this stupid person in Dallas because they think they know everything about, you know, certain games that are coming out.

463
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:32,820
that were coming out. I've been doing this for 18 years. So, you know, this first sheet,

464
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,980
I'm like, she gives me this thing that says, you know, our new releases that were coming

465
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:42,060
up in May. And the first thing that's on there is Ape Escape for the PSP. I'm like, I think

466
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:45,740
the state's wrong because it's in stores right now. It was one of the launch titles. No,

467
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:49,700
it got pushed back to May. No, it's in the stores. I picked it up with my hand, thought

468
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:55,620
about buying it, saw it sucked, and then put it back down. And, you know, and then, you

469
00:34:55,620 --> 00:35:00,860
You know, she's like, there's this other title on there that was, what was it?

470
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,820
Hey Arnold, the movie, the game for the GBA.

471
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:09,900
I'm like, hold on, hold on, hey Arnold, the movie, the game.

472
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,900
Exactly.

473
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,900
Okay.

474
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:17,660
Okay, and that game, that game came out three years ago, when the movie came out.

475
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,060
And she still insists it's a new release.

476
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:23,520
I'm like, okay, so that's when I had to get my boss involved.

477
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,300
saw the emails go back and forth and he joked to me because he actually has a

478
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:30,160
he's understanding so he's like so you're trying to piss off you know the

479
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:37,440
neighbor or fuck is that kid doing it there Oh giant paper airplane fucking

480
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,480
kid stop distracting me anyway no no you're trying to you're trying to piss

481
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:46,080
off the Dallas people but anyways I'm like trying to piss off the neighbor

482
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:52,960
throwing the giant paper airplane what the hell is wrong what kind of

483
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,960
What kind of inbred people do we have living around here, I swear.

484
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,960
Anyways, back to-

485
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,960
I don't think we were in Mississippi.

486
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,960
Back to the story, okay.

487
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,960
So yeah, this has been going on all week.

488
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,960
What's kind of cool though is they're actually kind of serious about the game side of everything.

489
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,960
So they're going to convert our conference room into a game room with a giant plasma screen TV.

490
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,960
So that's kind of cool.

491
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,960

506
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:30,020
there we had a dodge like this light that was by my door and in the fire

507
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:35,060
extinguisher in this glass case you know I have to dodge all that stuff barely fit

508
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:38,740
through and you should have seen the couch yesterday because see the way our

509
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:42,020
apartments set up you've kind of got the two apartments right there and it's like

510
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:45,420
a walkway that goes in front of both of them and then the apartment next to me

511
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:50,180
has the sidewalk that's actually coming you know away from the apartment and for

512
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:58,180
For me, all I've got is this hole between the bush that's just about enough, you know, wide enough to fit the couch. Just barely.

513
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:02,180
What the fuck is my phone ringing for? God dammit.

514
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:06,180
Anyways...

515
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,180
Hello?

516
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:12,180
Did you forget you were trying to do a show?

517
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:15,180
This is why cell phones need to be turned off during the show.

518
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:18,180
Should we like start playing the Jeopardy theme or something?

519
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,380
do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

520
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,960
start making orgasm noises.

521
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,740
That was Nellie and i'm gonna get into this too okay.

522
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:29,320
She was asking me if i needed pants.

523
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:38,540
because, you see, yesterday, while moving, hold on.

524
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:41,520
Okay, lemme think about this.

525
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:47,260
She knows that you do a radio show on the internet that is nominated for Broadcaster

526
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:53,600
of the Year, okay? So we are one of five stations nominated Broadcaster of the Year, so she

527
00:38:53,600 --> 00:39:00,480
understands what kind of commitment you put in Sunday nights. She calls you, interrupts

528
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:07,960
the show to ask you if you have pants. Rob, I'm getting to that, okay? Gosh, it, I was

529
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:17,960
That's the one that I asked her, okay? She was nice enough to go offer to get me pants at Walmart because, you know, the goddamn store's closed, okay? The mall.

530
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:24,960
Anyways, because the pants I had, my dress pants that I usually wear around for everything because I don't buy jeans for some reason.

531
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,960
So anyways, for some reason my ass seems to break through pants like crazy. I don't know why.

532
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:36,960
And so, so basically, I had busted pants. You know, I have one pair of pants left that I'm not really sure if I have.

533
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,660
So, just to be on the safe side, I got a backup pair of pants just to make sure.

534
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:45,960
No! Are you having problems with your ass?

535
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:54,460
So anyways, that is why she called, because she wanted me to, I was supposed to check to see if I had the pants in the dryer.

536
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:59,700
and I didn't quite get to do that before the show so she's getting me back up

537
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:05,100
Sarah of pants just in case anyways so pants problem aside so then didn't add

538
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:11,220
to this big smorgasbord of crap we have we have I was driving home today and

539
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:18,580
guess what comes on I love you check engine light so then you know so then I

540
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:22,260
had to go next door drop the car off so you know I could see what's wrong

541
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:25,620
because the check engine lights like something's wrong but I'm not telling

542
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:29,940
you what something is wrong it could be as little as the gas cap or it could be

543
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:33,660
your engines falling apart but we're not going to tell you I'm just going to turn

544
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:37,980
on the light and you got to take it down to the shop so they can laugh at you if

545
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:42,260
it's something stupid you know which I checked the gas you know cap three times

546
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:46,940
all my fluids are fine so it's nothing I did to the car it's just the car

547
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:52,780
falling apart. Your fluids are fine. Does, does the car need pants? The car does not

548
00:40:52,780 --> 00:41:04,260
need pants. But yeah, last week. GIVE ME PANTS! Yeah, last week. Yes, I've seen. Yeah, that's

549
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:11,020
true. Anyways, so, pants, car, moving, stuff aside, um, it's been an okay week. It's just,

550
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:16,420
it's one hell of a hectic week, and it's not gonna get any better this week, so. Um, oh

551
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:26,420
Oh well. Our chat room, which I haven't plugged yet, www.oranselmtrader.com. Click on chat. There's already a ton of people in there. I don't need to plug it because it's a party in there already, but hopefully some of you guys will want to join it.

552
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:35,420
We don't have the chat room, unfortunately, on the TV studio cam today. Only I and Dark Soccer can see it, but we will pass along the messages, such as,

553
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:43,420
Firebomba has an explanation for why Loki is ripping all his pants. Firebomba's suggesting you're getting fat, fatty.

554
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:48,420
I'm okay I'm not getting fat it's actually not my ass is ripping him at the

555
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:52,420
fucking crotch gets ripped and then my nuts are too big over the pan and then

556
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:56,780
hold on and then goes on to say fatty McTubs might have to lose some tons

557
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:01,540
say I've fucking got tons of exercise week lifting the goddamn couch and

558
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:05,500

560
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:14,940

00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:38,860
Whole new meaning to the term-swelled head.

567
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:41,660
She wasn't complaining this morning.

568
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:52,540
You're listening to KTMI, too much information all the time.

569
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:57,180
We're experiencing technical difficulties right now.

570
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,500
The host is speechless.

571
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,140
We've got big balls?

572
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:02,300
He's got big balls.

573
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,900
Let's try this again.

574
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:04,900
Angel!

575
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:11,900

579
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:26,100
working on school and pets

580
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:33,280
my pants are probably fine thank you very much

581
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,840
it could be a fortune cookie, I don't know, that's up to uh...

582
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,360
instead of like

583
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:43,280
adding in bed to your fortune you add with pants

584
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,200
oh no

585
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,900
that could work

586
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:52,600
no no no no no, don't make me think about that

587
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:57,900
just uh... I actually found time to play final fantasy 11 this week

588
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:01,280
not really, not if I just picked it up this week

589
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:06,760
all the time

590
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:10,720
yeah i think that's good enough and then uh... and um... for the record of getting

591
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,000
in the case kind of

592
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,340
wrong and interesting at the same time

593
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:18,640
and uh... i'm gonna let rob uh...

594
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:23,020
maybe fill in that blank because i'm not consider explain it again

595
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:25,400
and he came from as eleven basically she got

596
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,560
she got scary monsters trained on top of her

597
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,260
and it's no fun at all

598
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:31,460
and uh... teleported out

599
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:35,740
he's called g m on that day

600
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:36,900
right moving on

601
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:40,620
uh... my week of my day was uh... pretty cool i can't top the panting though

602
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:43,380
honestly so i don't really know what i could say i did see it

603
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,740
you can't copy and

604
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:49,560
i did see margaret show on thursday which is pretty cool to build a lot of

605
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:54,700
uh... was a lot of recycled stuff from the last or which is kind of sad but

606
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,360
but you find that

607
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:00,220
but you have to have their body

608
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:06,620
what else is going on uh... i uh...

609
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:11,900
if you tell mike and mike and

610
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:15,740
okay i can i guess he did find past but for the record he is currently wearing

611
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:16,940
shorts

612
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:20,140
so it's not like he's completely bottomless here

613
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:22,180
into

614
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:23,660
something to note here

615
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:24,620
uh...

616
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:29,620
And then, I've also kind of been moving a little bit as well, I, as I said, you know, got the keys to the new place.

617
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:32,620
My big move stuff comes next Sunday, though, so I'm still here.

618
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:37,620
I was going to say, for having move stuff, there sure is a lot of shit on top of your computer desk, right?

619
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:43,620
Yeah, no, I haven't, I'm not moving until Sunday, but I kind of checked out the new place, and that's about it, nothing big.

620
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:50,620
Let's see, that's about it. I really can't top the other stuff going on, so.

621
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:56,120
You know, we weren't here last week. Everybody kind of had their own thing going on last weekend.

622
00:45:56,120 --> 00:46:00,120
I went and saw Garbage, the band, in San Francisco, so that was cool.

623
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,120
Blah to you, I say.

624
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,120
They're not garbage. They're actually pretty good.

625
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:09,120
Blah to you, I say, but I can top you. I get to see Garbage when it's open for Alanis Morissette.

626
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,120
Ugh, hate you.

627
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:14,120
Anyway, all right, let's go to a break. We definitely need a break here.

628
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:18,620
When we come back, more antics here on Orange Ons Radio, including some Bamani news.

629
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:22,100
there's actually been quite a bit in the past two weeks so of the thing that Mel

630
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:27,660

00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:52,620
Come to the temple of the dark

637
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:56,620
You're falling asleep, you're playing the devil's master

Care is fun, the rain falls

00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,000
She hates it too, but never ends

649
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:07,000
It's only love

650
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
But it never ends, no, it ain't

651
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

652
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Follow the sound, follow the sound

653
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
We're leaving the rain behind

654
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Together we'll be in harmony

655
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Taking the time, we will find our way

656
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Sunshine, I feel your energy, I need sunshine

657
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
But it's not on me now, sunshine

658
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Don't you hide away, I want sunshine

659
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:04,720
every day

660
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,880
I need sunshine, I feel your energy

661
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,240
I need sunshine, falling light on me now

662
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:16,160
Sunshine, don't be hiding where I want sunshine

663
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,840
Each and every day

664
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,240
Sunshine, I feel your energy

665
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,440
I need some time, you're falling down on me now

666
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,840
Some time, don't get high or away

667
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:30,840
I want some time with you just every day

668
00:52:55,840 --> 00:53:03,800
So the best part of Orange Lounge this DDR sucks.

669
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:04,800
Hollar!

670
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,780
The, the, the, the, the, the winners.

671
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:08,780
TTPO.

672
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:18,300
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 139, the last episode of Orange Lounge

673
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:20,020
Radio from our current studio.

674
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:21,020
Aww.

675
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:25,080
This DDR sucks pants.

676
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:28,080
Let the joke die. Step away from the joke.

677
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:36,080
Okay, if Jeff K. could live into Final Fantasy XI this long, I can have pants joy. Thank you.

678
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:39,080
I remembered something during How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, I wanted to talk about

679
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:46,080
that I didn't get a chance to, because I got sidetracked by pants. I went to an antique

680
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:50,080
store yesterday with my mom, because my mom loves shopping for antiques. You know, go

681
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:56,000
and I was looking around and I actually saw these antique like cactus jars and

682
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,160
when I looked at them I could only think of one thing I thought of DDR and I'm

683
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:04,600
going to post this link in the chat room there so you guys can pull up that

684
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,200
picture yourself if you want to look because I took that picture of my cell

685
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:11,480
phone now when you look at this does anyone else think Gomlund a couple right

686
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:17,000
here this whole set you want to know how much they wanted for this three-piece

687
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:25,000
set $55 I wanted it though you don't don't I was thinking about it just just

688
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,320
to have that sad little you know gum with a couple joke wouldn't that have

689
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:36,440
been funny anyway huh moving on we're gonna open up our skype line in a little

690
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:39,820
bit but first I want to talk about some DDR news going on right now did you know

691
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:46,560
boys and girls that there is a brand new DDR game coming out but it's probably

692
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:53,040
something you will never ever ever be able to afford. It's actually a DDR fitness game.

693
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:57,560
So Mel, if you don't mind, I'm sorry, you're having a side conversation there, I'm totally

694
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:03,360
interrupting. Tell us a little more about the DDR fitness project. What's going on here?

695
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:08,520
Alright, well just to give like a quick background on how it all came about and such, there was

696
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:13,840
a convention about two or three weeks ago called the IHRSA, which is like the International

697
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:18,560
Health Racquetball Sports Association. I know there's like an international racquetball

698
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:22,960
association out there but that said they have like an expo every year and it usually showcases

699
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:27,760
a lot of stuff in fitness so there's often a lot of like fitness equipment like treadmills,

700
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:32,880
exercise machines, uh they have a lot of people like GNC they go out there and they

701
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:37,120
promote their vitamins that kind of stuff so basically the whole thing is a bunch of

702
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:41,680
people running around in spandex that's what the convention is no but see the thing is you might

703
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,680
think that's bad but you're thinking you know from an anime con standpoint these

704
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:48,640
people work out and take care of themselves it's not a bad thing

705
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:56,840
cinema man say essentially well Konami actually had a booth there and Konami's

706
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:02,320
booth was actually a Konami Tokyo sports division and they actually do stuff like

707
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:06,480
tread day actually Konami does a sports line of equipment they do treadmills

708
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,800
they do like weight machines stuff it's actually kind of neat just you know

709
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,760
shortly they do stuff that's like computerized so like if you have a

710
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,860
treadmill you can actually like have a screen in front of you where you can

711
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:19,440
like surf the web you can like watch satellite TV there's really neat things

712
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,560
that it actually has a computer chip that you wear around your wrist where

713
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:26,320
you can go around like all a bunch of different machines in one gym and it'll

714
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:30,280
actually track how many calories you've been burning along the way with all the

715
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:33,740
different machines. Konami does a lot more than people think. Konami is not just

716
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:37,060
about you know DDR in Castlevania there's a lot more to Konami they

717
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:46,060
And when I go to the casino, I always see slot machines that were done by Konami, and that just trips me out, because I always think of Konami as, oh, you know, DDR and Gradius, right?

718
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:51,060
But Konami does a lot more than people think sometimes.

719
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:56,380
yeah sports is like their big uh... thing over in japan and uh... well game

720
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:59,640
more towards relevant stuff i guess they were actually showcasing something

721
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:04,940
called um... ddr studio which is basically sort of like

722
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:08,740
what ddr could be in a uh... fitness club type atmosphere obviously there

723
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:10,420
are limitations with

724
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:13,860
a home console where as like xbox you can only play up to four people you know

725
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:17,020
well what if like you want to have a whole bunch of people going out there

726
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:20,980
so there's uh... this program that they showed

727
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:23,140
how it worked was

728
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,160
you have like

729
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,500
wireless pads

730
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:29,100
and you can play up to like eight players you know on this um... demo

731
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:31,220
and what it is is

732
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:35,060
uh... you have like one instructor up front kinda like in any other aerobics class

733
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:37,840
they'd be giving you like showing off the routine so

734
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:41,140
there would be a game of DDR going but more so instead of paying attention to the screen and

735
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:43,580
looking at the arrows and you know timing your steps like

736
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:45,660
we all do just cause we're

737
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:47,460
like all conditioned for DDR

738
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:50,040
they actually take you through a routine which is almost like

739
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:53,880
for all intents and purposes. It's like freestyle, only they're teaching it to you along the way.

740
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:57,500
And they do all different types of programs with it. It's really neat. They do stuff like

741
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:01,320
stretching programs, like there's one that's like yoga, tai chi type stuff,

742
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:04,600
where you go into like different poses and you hold freezes and such.

743
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:08,240
And then they do stuff that's a little more advanced, like they do like a Muay Thai kickboxing

744
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,160
type thing.

745
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,200
So in a way it's almost sort of like

746
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:15,560
martial beat, only like a lot less weird, I guess.

747
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:19,280
I thought that was interesting. The story that you posted over on DDR Free kind of

748
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,900
talks about a little and if people want to see the story of course head on over

749
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:24,900
to ddrfreak.com they have more information there it's their top story

750
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:28,780
right now. It talks about that there's actually additional symbols like

751
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:33,220
there's stars and stuff that are used. In addition like you have the way the

752
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:36,540
graphic interface is set up is you basically have the step gauge in the

753
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:41,660
center of the screen and on to the sides of it they have like players one through

754
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:45,180
eight like one through like the odds on one side the evens on the other and it

755
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:49,720
It tracks your how many calories you burn just like in workout mode in DDR.

756
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:56,220
On top of that what it does is the additional symbols you have is a fist that you see coming

757
00:58:56,220 --> 00:59:00,360
up and the fist will either say L or R. So when that comes up to the step gauge that's

758
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:04,160
your the step zone that's your cue to throw a left punch or a right punch.

759
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:07,120
It's variant of course obviously by the routine sometimes there'll be a jab sometimes there'll

760
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,200
be an uppercut.

761
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:12,700
It's dictated by the actual workout routine itself and then there's one that's a star

762
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:18,700
So it's really trying to take this DDR being a fitness thing and taking it one step further, really.

763
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:29,700
They're creating ninjas! They're creating ninjas, people! Don't you see? Ninjas! Kicking and punching, what more do we need? They're ninjas!

764
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:33,460
they're creating it yet people don't you think

765
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:38,980
kicking and punching what more do we need to make that

766
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:42,860
twenty-four-hour ninjas coming soon near you uh... to uh... with our fitness

767
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:43,740
theory of

768
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:49,620
uh... that like eight times uh... three ninjas the movie

769
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:51,740
uh... luminous while while

770
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:55,220
uh... though but i mean i get a lot of people

771
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:57,020
and i think the premise of it

772
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:59,380
the cool thing i noticed about like the hardware is

773
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:02,300
no i think they're using wireless pads but the pads that you see out there

774
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:05,080
aren't really like the consumer want to see which are like

775
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:06,720
kind of the vinyl over

776
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,960
and that that you know the foldable soft pads

777
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,640
that he is uh... somewhat semi-hard pad

778
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:14,680
what is it so i like to use a hard rubber which is kind of like

779
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:17,600
with the use in car floor mats

780
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,080
pretty worried it's very durable actually

781
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:21,800
and i'll take that they said

782
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:25,420
that one that's only wireless as more like a bluetooth type infrared

783
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:27,320
type technology that they used

784
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:30,760
So that was just another tidbit of that.

785
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,320
And I actually work with PS2.

786
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,640
So if there was a way I could ever actually get my hands on

787
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:35,880
that, I'd so be there.

788
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:40,760
But the thing about, I guess, what a lot of people are

789
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:43,880
commenting is, a lot of people, especially in the

790
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,880
just online community, are saying like, great, where's

791
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:46,800
our arcade mix?

792
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:47,880
Boohoo, no one cares.

793
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,240
You're like, this is fitness.

794
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,520
The last thing we need to see is this.

795
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:53,280
It's like, the way I see it right now, if Konami's arcade

796
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:56,760
division does not want to go in the route of Dance Dance

797
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:59,620
Revolution and I've obviously they don't want to do something in America

798
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:04,220
This is their only alternate route because if they keep targeting the same gamers, you know

799
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:10,020
Like at you know on the consumer level, you know that number may or may not grow very much

800
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:13,280
Yeah, I mean that this is at the point where I think DDR is almost topped out

801
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:18,020
I mean, it's not to say it can't get any better, but there's not much room left, you know, I

802
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:25,020
I do think, Loki's got a comment. Let's hope to God that they have these pads at E3 instead of the crappy soft pads.

803
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:28,020
All mentioned after Jason.

804
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:34,020
What I'm kinda, you know, I really, really wish that they would be doing a new DDR arcade mix.

805
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:40,020
I mean, but I don't see this as a bad thing at all because any exposure additional for DDR is gonna be pretty cool.

806
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:43,020
It's gonna benefit us all as fans of the game in the long run.

807
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:45,020
So I don't see where you can sit there and go, you know,

808
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:49,060
you know, oh, this sucks! You know, because it doesn't suck. I mean, it's kind of cool.

809
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:53,580
It's a different direction for DDR. But, you know, yeah, I get kind of sad that, you know,

810
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:57,540
there's not going to be an arcade mix anytime soon. But, Starxgirl, you have a comment.

811
01:01:57,540 --> 01:02:02,060
The other thing is that by bringing it into a gym, it kind of legitimizes it a little

812
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:06,020
bit versus that crazy game that all the gamers play. It's like, oh, hey, it's something that

813
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:10,620
other people who may not play games for any other reason can go and do. So it kind of

814
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:15,500
makes it less of a bastard stepchild in a way, and brings it back into the forefront

815
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:19,460
and can definitely bring some new people into it.

816
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:23,620
I mean, they're going for the right target audience right now. Like I said, you're going

817
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:27,420
for a whole new audience, bringing them into DDR. You're bringing people who are fitness

818
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:33,420
goers, because when we were displaying it off at the convention, there were still people

819
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:37,040
who had never heard of it. There were still people who were totally alien to them. They

820
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:41,200
get on it and next you know they're finding that it's you know a nice fun challenging

821
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:46,080
game and they're thinking about their nieces and nephews so it's you know we're the company

822
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:50,000
itself is still promoting DDR we're just going a little bit of a roundabout way to you know

823
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,200
a new set of people.

824
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:57,960
If you're a non-gamer adult that has that doesn't have children you probably have never

825
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:03,080
heard of DDR honestly because either your kids showed you what DDR was or you're a gamer

826
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:07,320
adult like most of us are here and you've found DDR on your own, but if you're a non-gamer

827
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:12,140
adult I can totally see how you've never heard of DDR, honestly. Especially if you're a gym

828
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:16,140
bunny and you don't have time to go to the arcades, so it makes sense.

829
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:17,140
No comment.

830
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:25,340
But, DDR Studio, it's actually a pretty fun game. I actually got to try it out myself.

831
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:28,700
When you go through a whole DDR Studio, like the demo that they did, it was about like

832
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:34,740
25 minutes straight of DDR of like working out and it was a lot of it was

833
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:42,860
pretty hectic and I nothing says like strenuous like boxing to kakumei that's I

834
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:46,580
gotta see this I'm really curious of anybody in this area is gonna get it

835
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:49,940
because I just I want to see it it sounds kind of neat do I can we expect

836
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:54,300
to see pictures or they can do a website for it or anything a promos a lot of

837
01:03:54,300 --> 01:04:11,300
Some of the songs I noticed were from Beatmania-type songs, but the one I definitely remember was on Kakumei. I think one was something from Beatmania 6.

838
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:14,300
Wait, are there songs in this that have not been in DDR yet?

839
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:18,300
Yeah, there are some that are pretty new.

840
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:19,300
Huh.

841
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:22,740
outside trying to like get a bunch of stuff from jason about it

842
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:25,100
uh... but thing is it's like

843
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:26,040
you know they're

844
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:28,780
can always not going to be willing to give us any video footage so i'm just

845
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:31,420
trying to get either like a press release or just get some stills i know

846
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:33,640
they were doing stills on

847
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,960
that day and i would've brought my ditch camp but

848
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:40,120
uh... you know what may have been able to that's very surprising i just assume

849
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:43,300
that they had taken like max to and converted it

850
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:47,300
for their with all those things on that one area that i think it is new state

851
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:51,020
home release at some point of something like this because you know you're gonna get people

852
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:56,500
that are, hey this is kind of fun, oh hey I can do this at home too. You know? I'm sure

853
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:57,500
that's the direction they want to go.

854
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:00,580
It would be a pretty smart marketing round, definitely.

855
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:03,580
The other interesting thing to see on that line would be if they make it like, you know

856
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:06,780
how they have those Atari things where you just plug in a joystick and it's like all

857
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:10,580
the old school Atari games. Because adults who aren't gamers don't have any other reason

858
01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:14,960
to get a Playstation or Xbox and that just makes the system a heck of a lot more expensive.

859
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:18,100
just like some sort of standalone thing where you plug it in and plug the pad in and you're

860
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:19,100
ready to go.

861
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:20,100
That's actually a really smart idea.

862
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:25,060
You've seen those DDR, you can see these at the mall, they suck, they're shitty little

863
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:26,060
things.

864
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:28,060
I saw that on the freaking Avon kiosk.

865
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:30,300
Midi songs, they're horrible.

866
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:32,460
My sister bought that for my nephew.

867
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:37,860
Was it the one that has Survivor by Destiny's Child?

868
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:43,740
Yeah, that's how it goes.

869
01:05:43,740 --> 01:06:02,020
was basically it yes it's basically playing DDR on the Game Boy well it'll

870
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:04,340
be interesting to see what develops of this I'm now you've got me all

871
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:07,740
interested with that song list because it makes me think hmm could the songs

872
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:12,420
they're using in this be something we see in the next home release I don't

873
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:17,420
I'll keep talking to the contacts and get what I can.

874
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:19,420
Sounds good. Sounds good. All right.

875
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:22,420
So, does this have an official name yet?

876
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:25,420
It's called DDR Studio. Basically, it's out in Japan.

877
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:30,420
Right now it's patent pending in America right now, because essentially that's what we were doing at the convention.

878
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:36,420
We were pitching the idea to a bunch of people who were managers of fitness clubs and such.

879
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:41,420
Essentially, if they garner enough interest, then it's something they'll move forward with.

880
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:48,420
So it's strictly conceptual on this side of the world, but it's very much reality elsewhere.

881
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:53,420
You know, if this does show up at my local gym, I am definitely going a lot more.

882
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:55,420
Oh, hell yeah.

883
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:59,420
I would go much more as well, so it'd be interesting.

884
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:02,420
Might be motivation for me to get my fat ass up and exercise.

885
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:06,420
And, Loki, good excuse for you to ruin more panels.

886
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:08,420
Everything comes up for you.

887
01:07:08,420 --> 01:07:12,700
What the hell is going on here? Jonas just showed up and he brought a PSP as well.

888
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:16,980
And he brought us dinner. It's only because he came last week when we were doing the show.

889
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:22,500
Yeah, that's kinda sad. Alright, anyway. Don't you feel like the odd child left out that doesn't have a PSP?

890
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:28,540
You're so not cool. I am not cool, actually. We're gonna open up the Skype line in a little bit, but first

891
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:29,860
a couple of quick things.

892
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:34,900
Sharkskroll, I actually, speaking of PSP, you have an interesting story about

893
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:37,920
yeah how how the PSP can

894
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:42,380
can sometimes take your place the PSP the DS

895
01:07:42,380 --> 01:07:46,060
anything did you want to talk about you don't have to talk about this but

896
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:50,060
have the story now yes have the story now okay so I have

897
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:54,540
I have a friend I gotta stop you for real quick here

898
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:58,580
Jonas just walked in with a loving lamb

899
01:07:58,580 --> 01:08:01,980
and a ball gag an inflatable

900
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:03,980
Um, sex lamb and a ball gag.

901
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:05,980
Jonas, Jonas, hi Jonas.

902
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:08,980
Jonas, come here, come here, get on the mic, Jonas.

903
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:14,980
I'm sorry sharks girl, but um, when inflatable lambs and ball gags are brought into play,

904
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:18,980
I don't give a shit about your PSP story anymore, I hope you'll understand.

905
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:20,980
Alright, love ya.

906
01:08:22,980 --> 01:08:28,980
Jonas, now, remind me, you went, you went 40 days with no boner for Lent, right?

907
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:29,980
Yeah.

908
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:35,260
Okay, how do you go from no boner for 40 days to bringing-

909
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:36,260
I survived.

910
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:37,760
How do you go from the-

911
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:42,620
You are Easter-eyed fucking soldier!

912
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:45,660
Islander is just finding this out for the first time.

913
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:54,260
Jonas, how do you go from being Mr. No Boner, for lack of a better term, to bringing to

914
01:08:54,260 --> 01:09:00,900
to this show, which has nothing to do with sex, last time I checked, an inflatable lamb

915
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:03,100
and a ball gag. Please explain.

916
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:10,660
Okay, for those who don't notice, I just turned 22 yesterday, and a lot of people gave me

917
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:13,140
some sex stuff, so...

918
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:17,820
So why did you bring it here? Did you think that we, did you think, oh god, it's the,

919
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:21,820
you know, it's the last episode of Orange Lounge in that studio, let's all fuck a sheep!

920
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:23,820
Let's do it!

921
01:09:30,820 --> 01:09:34,820
You know what? If Dark Sakura gets too angsty tonight, we'll just shove this ball in her mouth!

922
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:37,820
You know what? Fuck that!

923
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:47,820
Jonas, I don't know what to do with you sometimes.

924
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:49,820
Alright, anyway, back to Sharks Girl.

925
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:52,820
Alright, yes, please, back to Sharks Girl.

926
01:09:52,820 --> 01:09:55,820
I'm sorry, Sharks Girl, but I had to go there.

927
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:59,820
And you know what's funny is that's just, like, so par for the course for this story.

928
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:03,820
Better than being hijacked by Loki's pants.

929
01:10:03,820 --> 01:10:09,820
Anyway, please, your story about the DS, PSP, etc.

930
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:13,820
Okay, I have a friend who is not of any of the circles that anyone knows.

931
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:15,820
He moved away, he moved back, long story.

932
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:20,200
so I've been hanging out with him pretty often because he lives in Fremont now

933
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:23,560
and works at Dave and Buster's so maybe we can all harass him on Saturday if

934
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:28,480
he's working that would be fun we could we could have fun with that and he works

935
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:35,280
in the dining room we can really harass him at any rate um yes I said harass

936
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:42,880
I'll say it again to harass harass harass there are you happy and I wonder

937
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:55,840
harass. Harass. Harass the pants. Anyway, so I'm known for being a bit of the gadget

938
01:10:55,840 --> 01:11:03,000
junkie if it's cool and a new toy I want it so I have the iPod I almost ended up

939
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,840
with the second iPod last weekend I have the PSP I have the DS I have all the fun

940
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:12,840
You're a Veruca game! I want it and I want it now, Daddy!

941
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:13,840
Yeah, yeah, pretty much.

942
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:14,840
She is a consumer whore.

943
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:15,840
And how!

944
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,840
Anyway, sorry, I keep interrupting.

945
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:21,840
So I, um, meet up with said friend and show him,

946
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:23,840
Oh look, I got this nifty new Nintendo DS.

947
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:28,840
He has proceeded to yell at me if I don't bring the DS with me every time I see him now.

948
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:33,840
So then, he told me not to get a PSP and I ignored him and got a PSP anyway.

949
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:38,240
And so I said oh look what I got a PSP and now all he wants to do is play the PSP

950
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:45,420
so yes my friends I have gone from being seen for just you know my loving charming self as a

951
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:49,440
Excuse to get to play DS and a PSP and he gets pissed off when I don't bring him

952
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:54,760
So I've decided to screw that especially when he destroyed two of my games. I found out when I tried to sell them. Whoa

953
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:57,280
Yeah, I lent him to

954
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:02,360
What did I lend him to PS 2 games and they were perfect pristine?

955
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,640
And now they're scratched to the point that the place won't buy them back

956
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:12,600
So I'm being used for video games. Isn't that fun? I was I'm not even rich, and I don't really have all the new stuff, but

957
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:17,040
When I was younger, I was not rich, and I didn't have all the cool toys

958
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:21,460
I still had kids that would come over and only be my friend because I had you know Super Nintendo

959
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:24,300
Yeah, it's really kind of middle school. I'm kind of tired of it

960
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:27,760
So I just stopped bringing him or telling him and and he gets pissed off that I don't bring him

961
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,000
I'm like oh guess what fuck you don't care

962
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Alright.

963
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:37,000
So, that's why I showed you my PSP the minute I walked in, because you're cool and I love you.

964
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Aww, thank you.

965
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
And of course, you show it to me and what do I do? Oh, I already played that.

966
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Well fine then!

967
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,000
So yes, lesson of the story, don't use your friends for their video games, it's not cool.

968
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Alright.

969
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:58,160
Anyway, we are going to open up the Skype line so you guys can call in because I'm sure

999
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:18,880
expecting a lot of people want to get in tonight so we'll start it off with our

1000
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:23,400
first caller hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Dennis Alcom here. Yes my friend

1001
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:29,080
what's on your mind? Let me see just the comments and how you know DDR is taking a

1002
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:34,840
new path in just basically instead of focusing on more of the gameplay just

1003
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:40,600
focusing on on the exercise it's a step in another direction exactly that's what

1004
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:46,720
I said it's kind of like another branch in the road okay and so I mean I don't I

1005
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:49,560
mean I still I still have hopes that they're gonna make another arcade mix

1006
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:55,080
but I don't expect that you know I'm not so fixated on the fact that it is but in

1007
01:15:55,080 --> 01:16:01,200
reality it might be possible. I'm trying not to lose hope over it. No, but think

1008
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:04,360
about it. Logistically it's possible because they could do it through a

1009
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:08,380
third party. Like Betzen is their, as you know, Betzen is their

1010
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:14,880
official, you know, distributor. Okay. So if they ever wanted to make a

1011
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:18,360
mix in America and they needed to distribute, you know, to bring it out

1012
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:25,560
there they could use them to distribute that's an idea I mean we're not president

1013
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:28,680
we're not presidents of Konami distribution or anything so we would know

1014
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:34,560
but you never know so it's an option yeah it's right there in place because

1015
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:38,080
even though they shut down their American operations they can still make

1016
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:41,960
the cabinets in Japan and ship them over here you know assuming they have a

1017
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:50,000
distributor okay yeah but you know I'm just you know I don't know I mean this

1018
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,640
whole DDR studio thing yeah it sounds promising I just hope that you know it

1019
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:59,200
could just make DDR you know not something that would over kill

1020
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:03,640
the exposure but just something that would get it that would make it

1021
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:08,960
known to almost the average Joe because the average Joe six-pack won't even know

1022
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:17,960
Well, you know, as we were saying earlier, even, you can't complain about DDR Studio because, of course, like what, the third reply in that thread was,

1023
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:21,960
Fuck this game! We want new Konami arcade stuff! You can't really-

1024
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:23,960
I want it in the green studio!

1025
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:32,960
Yeah, yeah. Don't even let me go there yet. Okay. But, any new DDR is going to be good for the scene as a whole because it's more exposure.

1026
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:37,960
Exactly. You know, Konami's probably playing it both ways.

1027
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:42,960
Trying to appease the scene that pretty much built DDR in this country,

1028
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:49,960
and then trying to do their own thing by trying to branch out and focus on one aspect of DDR.

1029
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:51,960
Okay, alright.

1030
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:57,960
It's kind of like that. Yeah, they're playing both ways. That's pretty much what Konami's doing.

1031
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:05,680
So, I have, you know, pretty much, we don't even know whether or not there's going to be another mix in the fall, or something like that, or in the near future.

1032
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:10,160
Well, we do know that there is one thing that's going to be shown at E3 this year, for sure.

1033
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:11,240
Obviously, TDR with Mario.

1034
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:16,760
Yeah, TDR with Mario is definitely going to be shown at E3. IGN leaked that one earlier this week. We know about that, so.

1035
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:21,280
But what is Konami going to do to follow up Extreme and UltraMix 2? Tell me that.

1036
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:26,080
Well, the assumption is something is coming. They can't just leave us hanging with that, but...

1037
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:33,080
They could probably, I don't know, I could just throw it out there and they probably could pour party collection to this country and then basically, you know, shoot themselves in the foot.

1038
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:44,080
Well, nah, I, nah, bah, bah, bah, bah, because DDR Extreme was such a radical departure from DDR Extreme in Japan, wouldn't you logically think that we're going to get something brand new?

1039
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:46,080
They're not going to port us something over? We're going to get something new?

1040
01:18:46,080 --> 01:19:00,080
I just, I don't even know what the Japanese, you know, whatever's left of the DDR scene over there, I mean, you know, the whole, whoever still plays there actually thinks of the new songs that were actually made for UltraMix, you know, and UltraMix 2.

1041
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:11,080
It's really hard to see what they think, and how, you know, this is based, you know, on how UltraMix 2, and how we managed to make our own mix, something that, you know, American DDR players could call their own.

1042
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:24,080
Oh yeah, I agree. The recent U.S. mixes have far surpassed their Japanese song list arguments aside, I mean, Big Boo Hoo, Cartoon Heroes hasn't been released in the U.S. now.

1043
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:29,080
The games themselves have surpassed Big Boo Hoo, Aqua Suck.

1044
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:37,080
What they lacked in like, you know, popular songs from DDR Extreme, they made up for with brand new ones from 2DX and other Bamani.

1045
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:47,080
So you can't argue with that, that they're actually branching out into 2DX and really, you know, really, they're branching out into Bomani that these DDR players are most likely to play.

1046
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:51,080
Alright, someone who's been on the inside wants to comment. Hold on, hold on, Taku, hold on.

1047
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:59,080
I was just, I mean, I might be a minute or two behind, but I was hearing something about how, like, the US can break out into their own as far as, like, DDR goes.

1048
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:08,080
I think that's what was the intention of when Konami of Hawaii was basically assigned to do UltraMix and basically the whole Xbox series.

1049
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:17,080
I mean the reason why I think UltraMix 2 was the way it was, was because it was essentially there was a lot of feedback from the American audience.

1050
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:22,080
Right! Hell, we even made the steps for the songs.

1051
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,080
Who's we?

1052
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:26,020
we are going to get back to the only way we can do it

1053
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:29,780
i don't know if we have it with dvd our players

1054
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:35,680
it mean you know i don't have a job they're going to let you let them and

1055
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:38,280
they're going to let them in a different uh... i mean you know it

1056
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:40,500
you know i mean it's looking but its

1057
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:42,640
to say that's going to be the end of it

1058
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:45,800
no not quite you know i don't think that that's the story i doubt it i mean

1059
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:49,020
they just wanted to tell you know like we're gonna let you telegraph or doing

1060
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:50,720
six months down the road whatever

1061
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:56,720
And, you know, in all fairness, I don't even work for the company anymore, but, you know.

1062
01:20:56,720 --> 01:21:06,720
But I just want to trip. I mean, it's like, if you really want to, you know, basically have power as far as, like, dictate what Konami does, buy 51% of their stock.

1063
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:12,720
Half of their stock? I don't even know if that's available, but at 20 bucks a pop, that's a lot, man.

1064
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:16,720
Alright. Saku, we gotta let you go because other people are trying to get in, but thank you so much for calling. Have a good one.

1065
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:17,720
Okay.

1066
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:24,720
Alright. Alright. So, you know, again, to sum that one up, any exposure for DDR is going to be a good thing.

1067
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:34,220
And the U.S. definitely breaking out into their own with UltraMix 2, and DDR Extreme being so radically different from its Japanese counterpart this year.

1068
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:36,720
Let's take another call. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1069
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:38,720
Hey, Sky. It's El Mullet.

1070
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:40,720
Hello, El Mullet. What's on your mind, buddy?

1071
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:44,720
Ah, just, this is one hell of a show you got going on right now.

1072
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:52,240
It's always these shows where we come in and honestly, I'm gonna be honest like five minutes before the show started tonight. I was just gone

1073
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:55,760
Let's just get this over with I have a headache

1074
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:59,000
I want to get through this show so I can go back to bed and

1075
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:05,660
Now it's like why is it whenever I approach the show with that attitude the shows end up being just chaotic funness

1076
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:08,840
Well, I'm glad you approach things with a bland attitude sky

1077
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:11,840
It makes it greater for the rest of us.

1078
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:16,960
Aren't the rest of you so comfortable knowing that I approached this show with such a positive

1079
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:17,960
attitude?

1080
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:21,160
Oh yeah, let's do this again.

1081
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:22,160
What's on your mind, Elmoley?

1082
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:28,160
Well, I recently came into Beatmania 2DX 9th style, and I've been having a ball with that.

1083
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:31,560
I don't know if that's good to do to a machine, but okay.

1084
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:32,880
Just stop it, Loki.

1085
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:33,880
Just stop it.

1086
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:35,880
Loki, you already lost this show.

1087
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:45,880
I'm sorry Elmo, I apologize for Loki's behavior.

1088
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:49,880
Nah, don't. At least I get to burn on him once before you go to your next studio.

1089
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:53,880
We're not dying. We are starting over.

1090
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:54,880
Good for you.

1091
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:55,880
It's new.

1092
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:58,880
Alright.

1093
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:01,880
Alright, so what else is on your mind Elmo?

1094
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:02,880
You got 9th style.

1095
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:10,120
I got 9 style, and I do have a PSP now, and I do have Lumines for it, and I do have a

1096
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:13,440
couple other games that are currently collecting dust.

1097
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:17,920
I would like to make a note that currently there are at least three or four PSPs in this

1098
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:21,500
room, and I think at least three of them are playing Lumines.

1099
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:23,500
As they should.

1100
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:24,880
Amen.

1101
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:31,580
It's the one game that I can honestly say is the only reason right now that a PSP should

1102
01:23:31,580 --> 01:23:36,920
be bought right now. Well, I'm kind of waiting for PopCap to rip it off like they do all

1103
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:41,880
the other puzzle games, so that I can play Luminous online. But they'll probably call

1104
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:48,380
it, you know, Force or Magic Squares, or, you know. Musical Squares. Musical Squares

1105
01:23:48,380 --> 01:23:53,060
or something, you know. You know PopCap.com, they rip off all the good puzzle games and

1106
01:23:53,060 --> 01:23:55,780
make their own version. I'm gonna tell them that name. I'm gonna go to PopCap and say,

1107
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:57,780
I have a title for your luminous rip-off.

1108
01:23:57,780 --> 01:23:58,780
There you go.

1109
01:23:58,780 --> 01:23:59,780
Give me money.

1110
01:23:59,780 --> 01:24:00,780
Alright.

1111
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:06,780
And we could call it Puzzle Pants as some post-it show rumor.

1112
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:08,780
Oh boy.

1113
01:24:08,780 --> 01:24:09,780
Anyway.

1114
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:13,580
What do you think about the whole DDR stuff at E3 this year?

1115
01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:14,580
What do you think we're going to see?

1116
01:24:14,580 --> 01:24:18,980
We know that we're going to be seeing DDR with Mario, per the earlier Orange Entree report

1117
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:24,180
that said IGN blew the lid on that, and that we are going to see DDR with Mario at E3.

1118
01:24:24,180 --> 01:24:26,820
What do you think else is in store for us at E3?

1119
01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:30,440
I think we're going to see PS2 and Xbox iterations.

1120
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:34,520
We didn't know it was coming in 2002 when DDR Max was announced.

1121
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:39,760
We didn't know anything was coming in 2003 when Max 2, well, we knew Max 2 was coming,

1122
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:42,260
but we didn't know UltraMix was coming.

1123
01:24:42,260 --> 01:24:47,120
We didn't know UltraMix 2 was coming even though we knew Extreme was coming in 2004.

1124
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:50,660
We don't know anything outside of DDR with Mario for right now.

1125
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:53,420
We can rest assured we're going to see some new iterations.

1126
01:24:53,420 --> 01:24:57,920
I stake my career on it, as in quasi-internet celebrity.

1127
01:24:57,920 --> 01:24:59,920
Ooh, okay.

1128
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:01,920
You heard it here first.

1129
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:05,920
If you don't see any new PS2 or Xbox games, I will retire forever.

1130
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:08,920
Oh, wow, that's some strong words there.

1131
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:11,920
You better hope I lose this archive if that does turn out to be true.

1132
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:12,920
No, I am actually with you.

1133
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:16,920
I'm not going to stake my internet celebrity on it because I don't have much to wager,

1134
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:19,920
but I do think we are going to see new PS2 and Xbox misses.

1135
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:20,920
I think it's inevitable.

1136
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:24,280
Well, I don't have much to wager either, but there are people that want to see me retire,

1137
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:25,280
I'm sure.

1138
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:26,280
All right.

1139
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:27,280
Your website, Elmoit.

1140
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:28,280
Let us know.

1141
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:29,280
Insidepulse.com.

1142
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:30,280
All right.

1143
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:31,280
Visit it.

1144
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:32,280
Love it.

1145
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:33,280
You haven't had a new column in a while.

1146
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:34,280
That's true.

1147
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:35,280
The school's been getting in the way.

1148
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:36,280
I've been taking on some new duties.

1149
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:40,720
I'm the news editor now, which means I have full control over the news board, which is

1150
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:46,920
why our news board is so kick-ass right now, and I might be coming into some more...

1151
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:49,420
I've actually been working on a feature.

1152
01:25:49,420 --> 01:25:53,420
And believe it or not, it's an in-the-groove-related feature.

1153
01:25:53,420 --> 01:25:55,500
Shock!

1154
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:59,700
I'm very curious to see what happens, because I know your feelings on in-the-groove, and

1155
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:00,700
I'm just kind of...

1156
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:06,760
Right, my feelings aside, this is more of a quasi-promotional piece, let's say, because

1157
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:10,700
I got an interview with someone in Red Octane, they were nice enough to answer some questions

1158
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:17,740
I had, and doing an official ignition pad review, they were nice enough to supply me

1159
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:23,820
with the pad, considering that's going to be the basic controller they're offering for

1160
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:25,740
this game. So how does it hold up?

1161
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:31,460
Oh, well, we'll see. We'll have to check that out when the article comes out. So keep an

1162
01:26:31,460 --> 01:26:33,380
eye on InsidePulse.com.

1163
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:38,140
It should be out sometime this week if I can get every...if I can...if everything goes

1164
01:26:38,140 --> 01:26:39,780
well, everything's on time and such.

1165
01:26:39,780 --> 01:26:42,060
All right. Well, Mullen, I'm going to let you go so I can take another call. But thanks

1166
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:43,340
so much for calling in. Have a good one, okay?

1167
01:26:43,340 --> 01:26:44,340
No problem.

1168
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:45,340
All right.

1169
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:46,340
You too.

1170
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:47,340
Later.

1171
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:52,340
You know, I always expect El Mullet to come in with, like, a guitar strum like El Cabong.

1172
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:56,340
Hold on. We're gonna go to another call here. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1173
01:26:56,340 --> 01:26:59,340
Oh, well, we'll see. We'll have to check that out when the, uh...

1174
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:05,340
Oh, whoa, turn down your volume there. First rule of radio. Turn down the volume, because we're hearing ourselves there.

1175
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:07,340
Hello. Are you there?

1176
01:27:07,340 --> 01:27:10,340
Everything goes well with everything going sorry.

1177
01:27:10,340 --> 01:27:12,340
All right, well, El Mullet, I'd like to go take you to that call today.

1178
01:27:12,340 --> 01:27:16,340
Can't hear him. I can hear myself, though, and I must say I sound sexy.

1179
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:19,340
Um, you gotta check your mic, buddy. We can't hear you. Sorry.

1180
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:20,340
That hot, Rob.

1181
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:21,340
Sorry, my friend. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1182
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:22,340
Rob, Rob, Rob.

1183
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:25,340
Oops, I just hung up on somebody else. I meant to hang up on that one. Yeah?

1184
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:26,340
Hey, sorry.

1185
01:27:26,340 --> 01:27:30,340
Wait, oh. Is somebody there? Oh, we got him. Hi. You're on Orson's Radio.

1186
01:27:30,340 --> 01:27:33,340
This is RPGKing7, coming to you from Canada.

1187
01:27:33,340 --> 01:27:36,340
Ooh, Canada. What's that about? What is it?

1188
01:27:36,340 --> 01:27:38,340
Oh, not much, you know. Weather's been really nice.

1189
01:27:38,340 --> 01:27:40,340
All right. Well, what's hung in mine?

1190
01:27:40,340 --> 01:27:51,780
for this time of year what's on your mind buddy hello did we lose them sorry I

1191
01:27:51,780 --> 01:27:58,180

1192
01:27:58,180 --> 01:28:03,100
bit new to this well not to know the DDR I've been doing DDR for about a year

1193
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:08,020
and a half two years now just want to thank you guys for doing the show it's

1194
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:13,020
That's really awesome, and I'd have nothing to do on Sunday night.

1195
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:18,020
Well, there's always desperate housewives, but it kind of sucks.

1196
01:28:18,020 --> 01:28:22,020
Do you get desperate housewives in Canada? I hope you don't.

1197
01:28:22,020 --> 01:28:29,020
Something else I can really think of, you guys are quite awesome, and just keep up with this,

1198
01:28:29,020 --> 01:28:31,020
and good luck with the move and everything.

1199
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:33,020
All right, no problem. Thank you for calling in.

1200
01:28:33,020 --> 01:28:35,020
Thanks for being a cool listener.

1201
01:28:35,020 --> 01:28:37,020
Yes, we like compliments and inflate our ego.

1202
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:41,020
By the way, Rob, I love the fact how you're waving goodbye.

1203
01:28:41,020 --> 01:28:43,020
Thanks, I'll sign off now. Keep going with it.

1204
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:44,020
Alright, later.

1205
01:28:44,020 --> 01:28:47,020
Wow, I think he couldn't hear us.

1206
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:48,020
We're big in Canada.

1207
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:52,020
Alright, yeah, it's nice to know we're big in Canada. We have an international following.

1208
01:28:52,020 --> 01:28:57,020
I need to visit Canada again. It's been a little while since I've been to Canada. I'd like to go back and visit.

1209
01:28:57,020 --> 01:29:00,020
Alright, let's go to another call. Hi, you're on Orange Island Radio.

1210
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:03,020
Just so you know, Sky, you have a great voice. I love it.

1211
01:29:03,020 --> 01:29:05,020
Oh, thank you. That's so nice.

1212
01:29:05,020 --> 01:29:09,020
You don't think it's too faggy? You don't think it's too faggy?

1213
01:29:09,020 --> 01:29:13,020
Because a lot of people say I'm too faggy.

1214
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:14,020
Nah, I don't think so.

1215
01:29:14,020 --> 01:29:17,020
Alright. It's just the way I am, dammit.

1216
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:19,020
So what if I'm a little nasally?

1217
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:21,020
We'd love you for it, that's just it.

1218
01:29:21,020 --> 01:29:23,020
Thank you, I appreciate it.

1219
01:29:23,020 --> 01:29:28,020
Sam Kinnison got his career forever with that. Ow! Ow!

1220
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:30,020
Who is one of my favorite comedians?

1221
01:29:30,020 --> 01:29:32,020
Alright. That explains it there.

1222
01:29:32,020 --> 01:29:33,020
Alright, what's on your mind, buddy?

1223
01:29:33,020 --> 01:29:41,020
Not much. I got a couple of stories for you. I know I told Jamie this one. I call it the PSP to hell.

1224
01:29:43,020 --> 01:29:46,020
What happened was a guy came to return on the PSP.

1225
01:29:46,020 --> 01:29:49,020
Oh, this is brilliant.

1226
01:29:50,020 --> 01:29:55,020
We had none in stock. He's getting all pissed off and all agitated that we have none.

1227
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:59,020
So customer service tells him, we can give you credit for a new one.

1228
01:29:59,020 --> 01:30:03,660
And he continues to scream about this until the General Manager walks over.

1229
01:30:03,660 --> 01:30:07,580
The General Manager tells him the only thing we can do is give you a refund.

1230
01:30:07,580 --> 01:30:11,460
He's like, fine, I'll take the refund. And he slams his hand

1231
01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:15,340
down on the counter. But it wasn't the counter he hit.

1232
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:19,340
Uh oh. The screen

1233
01:30:19,340 --> 01:30:23,340
was cracked into pieces.

1234
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:26,380
Ouch.

1235
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:29,700
Now I've heard about a couple burnt out pixels or two.

1236
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:33,020
Stupid! Stupid, stupid, stupid!

1237
01:30:33,020 --> 01:30:34,060
So what ended up happening?

1238
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:39,540
The general manager told him, can I give you a refund now? And he took a swing at the general manager.

1239
01:30:39,540 --> 01:30:42,700
Oh, I hope you had that boy escorted out.

1240
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:45,740
By the police, yeah. By the police.

1241
01:30:45,740 --> 01:30:49,300
But what happened was the general manager ducked

1242
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:52,580
and hit him right in the face and he went out.

1243
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:57,580
Oh my gosh. Drama at a game store? What the heck?

1244
01:30:57,580 --> 01:31:03,580
Best part is, the general manager was a six foot two tall girl.

1245
01:31:03,580 --> 01:31:05,580
That is awesome.

1246
01:31:05,580 --> 01:31:11,580
Wait a minute. So this guy went to take a swing at a girl over a PSP which he broke himself?

1247
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:12,580
Yes.

1248
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:14,580
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

1249
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:19,580
Huh. Interesting. Let us know when he's out of jail, okay?

1250
01:31:19,580 --> 01:31:22,080
Well yeah, I'll be sure of that.

1251
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:26,580
If we can get his picture, we'll post it on the website as our loser of the month.

1252
01:31:26,580 --> 01:31:28,080
I'll try.

1253
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:33,080
Okay. Alright, sounds good. Thank you so much for the call and the story. Anything else on your mind?

1254
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:37,080
Not really, I'm just watching a backlash of drama and shit, I'll just leave it at that.

1255
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:38,580
Okay, alright, have fun.

1256
01:31:38,580 --> 01:31:39,580
You too, take care.

1257
01:31:39,580 --> 01:31:40,580
Later, you too.

1258
01:31:40,580 --> 01:31:41,080
Bye.

1259
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:41,580
Bye.

1260
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:47,580
Okay, we'll try and get one more call in, at least for now. We'll open it up again a little bit later.

1261
01:31:47,580 --> 01:31:51,280
First, what I want to do though, real quick, before we pick up another call, wait for somebody to get in there.

1262
01:31:51,280 --> 01:32:00,680
Um, if you would be so kind, head on over to podcastally.com and vote for the Orange Lounge Radio to-go edition.

1263
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:07,180
I'm going to give you guys a direct link there in the chat room, because voting for us brings us up in the rankings there.

1264
01:32:07,180 --> 01:32:13,780
And, uh, a lot of people don't really notice Orange Lounge Radio as a gaming station because, you know, they think Orange Lounge, what the hell is that?

1265
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:17,640
So, you know, vote for us, it increases us in the rankings, and more people see us, and

1266
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:20,480
the community grows, and we're all happy.

1267
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:26,760
And we don't put spam in our podcast feed either, unlike some other feeds, which maybe

1268
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:28,440
we'll talk about on this week's podcast.

1269
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:29,440

Uh huh.

1281
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:13,760
You're on Orange Lounge.

1282
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:14,760
Hello?

1283
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:15,760
Hello!

1284
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:16,760
Hey!

1285
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:17,760
Hey, what's up?

1286
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:18,760
Ugh!

1287
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:19,760
It's about damn time!

1288
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:24,000
I know, it's a crazy li- I apologize to those of you guys not getting through tonight.

1289
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,000
It's lit up like hell.

1290
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:30,560
For- for my part as well, it's my fault too, because you know, I got a little bit late.

1291
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:32,680
You lucked out, the last guy didn't have his mic up.

1292
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:34,680
What's uh- what's uh- what's on your mind, buddy?

1293
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:40,180
Yeah, just helping you out with some Happy Sky song lists that are in Japanese.

1294
01:33:40,180 --> 01:33:41,180
Alright.

1295
01:33:41,180 --> 01:33:46,580
I'm gonna tell it to you, and here it is, the genre is disco, and the artist is a dance

1296
01:33:46,580 --> 01:33:50,220
man featuring disco, and this is kind of a tongue twister.

1297
01:33:50,220 --> 01:33:54,180
The song title is We Are Disco Yotsutachi No Chi.

1298
01:33:54,180 --> 01:33:55,180
Wow.

1299
01:33:55,180 --> 01:33:57,020
That's a mouthful there.

1300
01:33:57,020 --> 01:33:59,900
By the way, your mic is a little bit quiet, anything you can do to make yourself louder

1301
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:01,620
would be appreciated by the listeners.

1302
01:34:01,620 --> 01:34:02,940
Alright, now it's close.

1303
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:03,940
There you go.

1304
01:34:03,940 --> 01:34:11,940
Alright, yeah, um, the next one is a J.U. beat by, uh, T.A.T.S, not T.A.T.S, it's T.A.T.S,

1305
01:34:11,940 --> 01:34:15,940
featuring, uh, Hoshino Kanako, and it's, uh, Gekkou.

1306
01:34:15,940 --> 01:34:20,940
And then there's, uh, Funk, which is, uh, by dance, uh, the artist by Danceman, which is, uh,

1307
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:25,940
Ore wa bito manya, omae wa nani manya, which translates to, uh, I am beat mania.

1308
01:34:25,940 --> 01:34:27,940
You are what mania?

1309
01:34:27,940 --> 01:34:31,940
Ore, you know, Ore is a masculine way of saying I.

1310
01:34:31,940 --> 01:34:38,580
huh I am beat mania you are what mania yeah you are what mania I am beat mania

1311
01:34:38,580 --> 01:34:47,980
you are what no you didn't I am beat mania sorry couldn't help myself and

1312
01:34:47,980 --> 01:34:53,660
then there's a hard dance you know which is a remix of got paisio strong Jega oh

1313
01:34:53,660 --> 01:35:00,820
okay and then there's a you know huh and then a synthetic oh I forgot another

1314
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:04,820
The genre is Natural Sound and it's by Twin Amadeus.

1315
01:35:04,820 --> 01:35:09,820
Alta Turca Ompassion, you know, W-N, I kind of pronounce it as a O-N.

1316
01:35:09,820 --> 01:35:14,820
And it's very interesting that Alta Turca Ompassion is the remix of the Turkish March.

1317
01:35:14,820 --> 01:35:15,820
Oh, okay.

1318
01:35:15,820 --> 01:35:18,820
The Twin Amadeus version of the Turkish March.

1319
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:20,820
Ooh, that should be interesting, the old classic song.

1320
01:35:20,820 --> 01:35:23,820
Now, you've been checking out some of the videos, right, from Happy Sky?

1321
01:35:23,820 --> 01:35:24,820
Yeah.

1322
01:35:24,820 --> 01:35:25,820
In fact, I'm going to play a little clip.

1323
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:29,820
You actually sent me one of Eden, one of the new songs from 12th Style.

1324
01:35:29,820 --> 01:35:33,820
It's my very favorite Tarot song.

1325
01:35:33,820 --> 01:35:37,820
So you can hear a little bit there of what Eden sounds like, the new Tarot song.

1326
01:35:37,820 --> 01:35:41,820
Yeah.

1327
01:35:41,820 --> 01:35:45,820
Lots of double notes in that.

1328
01:35:45,820 --> 01:35:49,820
What else can we look forward to in the Happy Sky videos?

1329
01:35:49,820 --> 01:35:53,820
What else is in those videos that you think is worth sharing with our listeners?

1330
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:57,820
Well, you already saw Toe Jam. Yeah, I saw the Toe Jam video. That was pretty cool.

1331
01:35:57,820 --> 01:36:01,820
Yeah, I really like the song. It's the first time I've ever heard it.

1332
01:36:01,820 --> 01:36:07,820
You know, while I was listening to the song, I just yelled, YEE-HAW!

1333
01:36:13,820 --> 01:36:19,820
This is coming from the video there. Of course, tempo changes like hell.

1334
01:36:19,820 --> 01:36:21,820
But that's what you'd expect from Sojam.

1335
01:36:21,820 --> 01:36:26,640
it goes from uh... like from a hundred and three to a hundred and sixty bpm

1336
01:36:26,640 --> 01:36:31,480
in a minute sixty bpm is the fastest

1337
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:33,240
anything else in the videos

1338
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:35,280
that there's uh...

1339
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:36,480
what you'll call it

1340
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:39,040
yeah i don't like that i don't like the

1341
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:41,520
somehow or they won't be the money on my one anyone yet

1342
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:43,420
to play

1343
01:36:43,420 --> 01:36:46,980
i don't i don't know if it was a lot of the videos have generics i'm hoping that

1344
01:36:46,980 --> 01:36:50,880
changes before the final really it will have uh... you know actual videos when

1345
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:55,880
when the final product's been released, just like the same thing happened to BeQuiet.

1346
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:59,880
That's very true.

1347
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:00,880
Alright.

1348
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:01,880
Yeah.

1349
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:05,880
Okay, well, we're gonna go ahead and let you go, because our Skype line's on fire tonight, but thanks for the 2DX update,

1350
01:37:05,880 --> 01:37:12,880
and the borrowing of your Japanese accent is always appreciated as well from this very white host.

1351
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:22,880
And so this, and so, let me get my catchphrase first, and so this resident 2DX bastard walks back to the shadows of the Mani style.

1352
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:24,880
Thank you my friend, have a good one.

1353
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:25,880
Alright, later.

1354
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:29,880
I like our callers that have their own taglines, that's pretty funny.

1355
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:32,880
Alright, maybe we can squeeze in one more call.

1356
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:34,880
Hi, you're on Orange Long's Radio.

1357
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:39,880
It's this guy whose mic wasn't working earlier.

1358
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:45,680
earlier. Can you hear us, buddy? Hello? I know, we still can't hear him. We still can't

1359
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:54,680
hear you. Turn your mic up or something. Give him a few more seconds. Don't! Let's try another

1360
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:57,480
call. All right. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

1361
01:37:57,480 --> 01:38:01,880
Hey, it's me. It's Lemon Lime Jump. Hello, Lemon Lime Jump. How are you?

1362
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:07,480
Hey, I'm, uh, uh, yeah, I'm here. I don't know if, there. Is that better?

1363
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:09,480
Yes, we can hear you. What's up?

1364
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:15,480
Um, alright. I just wanted to say, yeah, I don't know why, for some reason I was up early and asked yesterday-

1365
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:16,480
Hello?

1366
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:17,480
Hi, we can hear you.

1367
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:19,480
Oh, okay. Um-

1368
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:22,480
We're just eagerly anticipating your every word.

1369
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:25,480
Oh, okay, I'm just- I need to turn off the radio.

1370
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:28,480
Oh, okay, yeah, definitely turn down the radio because it'll throw you off there a little bit.

1371
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:31,480
I've got it. Alright, um-

1372
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:43,480
So I was actually tuned into the Today Show yesterday, and I guess you've probably heard they had that DDR thing on it yesterday. It was just like a little five-minute segment.

1373
01:38:43,480 --> 01:38:46,480
No, I actually didn't hear about DDR on the Today Show. What happened?

1374
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:54,480
Yeah, I guess they were touting it for its fitness qualities.

1375
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:57,480
They had some fitness expert come in and try to show it off.

1376
01:38:57,480 --> 01:39:00,480
I think they had a couple of Cobalt flux pads

1377
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:03,480
plugged into a PS2 or an Xbox or something.

1378
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:13,480
And the thing I found interesting was that the song that they used for demonstration

1379
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:19,960
was Mobumoga. And I was thinking, Orange Lounge! Orange Lounge Radio. Oh, that's too cute.

1380
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:26,000
And then, yeah, my brain works funny. I don't know why. I have to interrupt real fast. Shark

1381
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:30,200
Squirrel has got this funny look on her face. You have to share this. Oh my god, I think

1382
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:35,400
you're my voice twin. Shark Squirrel and Lemon Lime Jump do sound very similar. It's kind

1383
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:40,600
of scary. It's like the same mannerisms, same voice, same everything. It's freaky. Everybody

1384
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:45,520
says I sound like my sister though. It says I don't... Well now there's yeah now there's

1385
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:49,300
three of you because you got you got a twin on the west coast. Actually there's

1386
01:39:49,300 --> 01:39:55,580
five because my family sounds like me too. Wow that's crazy. Wow I'm sorry you were

1387
01:39:55,580 --> 01:39:58,020
so you were into another thought there before I let sharks girl cut you off

1388
01:39:58,020 --> 01:40:04,100
there. That's right. But it was one thing that irritated me and I guess I don't know

1389
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:07,300
because they needed something for the folk cameras to focus on anyway they

1390
01:40:07,300 --> 01:40:11,700
demonstrated for like 30 seconds trying to play and then they had the two

1391
01:40:11,700 --> 01:40:16,020
guys talking and they still had the camera focused and they weren't even

1392
01:40:16,020 --> 01:40:19,940
playing anymore so it basically had the camera going boo or the camera focus on

1393
01:40:19,940 --> 01:40:27,300
the two TV screens going boo boo boo boo boo you too can be a DDR expert and I'm

1394
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:32,020
thinking what choice of camera shots was that I'm not quite sure you know what I

1395
01:40:32,020 --> 01:40:41,240
say to that director fired yeah yeah put on a comb-over you know tell him you're

1396
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:47,980
fired well thanks for the update because I had no idea that DDR was on the today

1397
01:40:47,980 --> 01:40:51,000
show I somehow completely missed that I wish that somebody would send a little

1398
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:55,800
clip somehow so we could see that so well hopefully that somebody got that

1399
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:58,780
and we can check that out later and of course if we can find a clip of the

1400
01:40:58,780 --> 01:41:02,780
Today Show, we will do in the great Orange Lounge tradition, we will play it and make

1401
01:41:02,780 --> 01:41:03,780
fun of it.

1402
01:41:03,780 --> 01:41:04,780
So.

1403
01:41:04,780 --> 01:41:05,780
We're cocky.

1404
01:41:05,780 --> 01:41:10,220
Hopefully not in the Today Show, but we'll see.

1405
01:41:10,220 --> 01:41:11,220
You never know.

1406
01:41:11,220 --> 01:41:12,220
They are desperate for ratings.

1407
01:41:12,220 --> 01:41:14,220
It just made me think of, yeah, NBC.

1408
01:41:14,220 --> 01:41:15,220
I know.

1409
01:41:15,220 --> 01:41:16,220
I know.

1410
01:41:16,220 --> 01:41:22,020
Also, if this is, yeah, your last show in the studio, I'm not quite sure how the broadcasting

1411
01:41:22,020 --> 01:41:28,740
works, but you know, I don't know if I'd be broadcasting

1412
01:41:28,740 --> 01:41:33,180
casting a show on my birthday, but I just want to say two days ahead of time, I want

1413
01:41:33,180 --> 01:41:38,420
to say happy birthday to Dark Sakura. We got the same birthday.

1414
01:41:38,420 --> 01:41:39,420
Do you guys really?

1415
01:41:39,420 --> 01:41:41,100
Yeah, I looked it up.

1416
01:41:41,100 --> 01:41:44,920
You and Dark Sakura and Linda Lime Jump have the same birthday, and she's saying happy

1417
01:41:44,920 --> 01:41:45,920
birthday to you.

1418
01:41:45,920 --> 01:41:46,920
Happy birthday to us!

1419
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:47,920

Yay.

1424
01:41:56,460 --> 01:41:57,460
Oh.

1425
01:41:57,460 --> 01:41:58,460
For a moment, I turned off the microphone.

1426
01:41:58,460 --> 01:42:00,460
Arigato!

1427
01:42:28,460 --> 01:42:32,920
You hear worse on cable TV anyway, so I mean not not the like cursing but like

1428
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Okay, never mind. I'm just

And um for a couple last

1431
01:42:45,140 --> 01:42:49,920
Words I wanted to say was um. I just wanted a few last words to say of course

1432
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:52,220

01:42:59,260 --> 01:43:02,420
denims, drawers, dungarees, jeans, drawers, knickers,

1436
01:43:02,420 --> 01:43:05,020
longies, overalls, pantaloons, panties, petal pushers, pegs,

1437
01:43:05,020 --> 01:43:07,500
shorts, slacks, trousers, and underpants.

1438
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:09,300
And now you know.

1439
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:11,820
They're pants.

1440
01:43:11,820 --> 01:43:13,500
Mel had a confused look on his face.

1441
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:15,600
He's about to, like he's got one of those looks

1442
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:16,780
like he's mid-eating.

1443
01:43:16,780 --> 01:43:18,740
He's about to shove some cake in his mouth.

1444
01:43:18,740 --> 01:43:20,420
And then he's like, huh?

1445
01:43:20,420 --> 01:43:21,980
What is this chick saying?

1446
01:43:21,980 --> 01:43:23,100
I'm like, it's pants, Mel.

1447
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:24,220
It's pants.

1448
01:43:24,220 --> 01:43:25,420
Thank you for sharing.

1449
01:43:25,420 --> 01:43:25,900
All right.

1450
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:27,660
I think I'm done with pants for the night, so.

1451
01:43:27,660 --> 01:43:28,460
All right.

1452
01:43:28,460 --> 01:43:29,380
Good evening to you all.

1453
01:43:29,380 --> 01:43:29,900
Thanks.

1454
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:31,340
Thanks for calling in, hon.

1455
01:43:31,340 --> 01:43:33,860
Have a good one.

1456
01:43:33,860 --> 01:43:36,020
Our listeners are so funny.

1457
01:43:36,020 --> 01:43:38,500
Maybe we can let one more call sneak in here.

1458
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:39,900
I'm liking the Skype line tonight.

1459
01:43:39,900 --> 01:43:42,380
Everybody's getting in.

1460
01:43:42,380 --> 01:43:44,020
So we'll see if anybody else gets in.

1461
01:43:44,020 --> 01:43:45,700
Again, one more time.

1462
01:43:45,700 --> 01:43:47,820
Please take a second.

1463
01:43:47,820 --> 01:43:49,820
Vote for our podcast.

1464
01:43:49,820 --> 01:43:51,460
We would totally appreciate that.

1465
01:43:51,460 --> 01:43:53,980
It's podcastally.com.

1466
01:43:53,980 --> 01:43:55,540
And then just do a search for Orange Lounge.

1467
01:43:55,540 --> 01:43:58,900
Or better yet, I'll just post the link right there in the chatroom and you guys can vote.

1468
01:43:58,900 --> 01:43:59,700
How's that sound?

1469
01:43:59,700 --> 01:44:01,460
Alright, let's go ahead and take this call.

1470
01:44:01,460 --> 01:44:03,580
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1471
01:44:03,580 --> 01:44:08,780
Hey, what do you call a binary system that distributes energy from one star into the other?

1472
01:44:08,780 --> 01:44:09,780
What?

1473
01:44:09,780 --> 01:44:12,180
It's John Fields.

1474
01:44:12,180 --> 01:44:14,020
What's on your mind?

1475
01:44:14,020 --> 01:44:21,020
Well, I was thinking about the upcoming E3, and you know, it's been quite a while since we've been hit with an arcade release of DDR.

1476
01:44:21,020 --> 01:44:24,260
So I'm wondering if they might actually spring that on us.

1477
01:44:24,260 --> 01:44:31,620
So, John thinks that a possible arcade release could be something that would be shown at E3.

1478
01:44:31,620 --> 01:44:38,460
I would have to say, unfortunately, it's very doubtful, because E3 is typically a consumer electronic show.

1479
01:44:38,460 --> 01:44:44,100
A new arcade mix would be something more for something like, what's the big arcade show they do in Vegas every year?

1480
01:44:44,100 --> 01:44:45,820
Coin-Op, something?

1481
01:44:45,820 --> 01:44:52,540
CES, Consumer Electronic Show? But they show arcade games there, that makes no sense.

1482
01:44:52,540 --> 01:45:01,540
Alright, well, okay, but, um, I did once, though, it's not unheard of, because I did see last year Andamiro was showing off, of all people.

1483
01:45:01,540 --> 01:45:03,540
It wasn't a Pump It Up game, but they were showing off an arcade game.

1484
01:45:03,540 --> 01:45:04,540
That game was cool!

1485
01:45:04,540 --> 01:45:06,540
That Korean, uh, tank? Was it a tank game?

1486
01:45:06,540 --> 01:45:07,540
It was a shooting game!

1487
01:45:07,540 --> 01:45:08,540
Yeah, it was like a shooting game?

1488
01:45:08,540 --> 01:45:12,540
And you had your controls on your gun, and then you had your fire buttons on your gun.

1489
01:45:12,540 --> 01:45:19,540
So, I'm not gonna say, can't happen, but, very, very unlikely, but, boy, wouldn't that be nice. Wouldn't that be nice.

1490
01:45:19,540 --> 01:45:20,540
Yeah, it would.

1491
01:45:20,540 --> 01:45:30,540
I guess also, since I am going to plug this anytime I can, I'll give you a little more information on Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst.

1492
01:45:30,540 --> 01:45:31,540
Okay, sure, why not.

1493
01:45:31,540 --> 01:45:35,540
This game has been confirmed for the USA and Europe now.

1494
01:45:35,540 --> 01:45:41,540
I heard about the new, there was like a Phantasy Star universe that was coming, but that's a different thing, right?

1495
01:45:41,540 --> 01:45:48,540
Yeah, that is actually the next incarnation of the game. Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst is basically the next Phantasy Star Online.

1496
01:45:48,540 --> 01:45:53,280
online it's gonna have episode 4 and all that sort of stuff on it plus a bunch of

That's the problem.

1521
01:47:56,700 --> 01:48:01,380
Oh no you shouldn't be able to hear yourself.

1522
01:48:01,380 --> 01:48:02,380

Call me a pedophile, I'm not a pedophile, I'm just a connoisseur of the young flesh.

1527
01:48:37,020 --> 01:48:46,500

Yes, Jamie's here. Jamie, Sam wants to talk to you.

1550
01:49:56,080 --> 01:50:01,880
I have... I have... I have Crayola sketches of your boobies.

1551
01:50:01,880 --> 01:50:08,880
I like using the peach because it's realistic.

1552
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:18,880
Uh oh, I got company.

1553
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:20,880
I got somebody here with me.

1554
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:21,880
I'm Miss Cleo.

1555
01:50:21,880 --> 01:50:23,880
Oh, hello.

1556
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:25,880
Hello, how are you today?

1557
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:27,880
Oh, I'm good, how are you?

1558
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:31,880
I'm hearing things, are you?

1559
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:35,880
Uh, how's Miss Cleo doing?

1560
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:39,880
Pardon me?

1561
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:43,880
Does Miss Cleo play DDR?

1562
01:50:43,880 --> 01:50:47,880
I'm hearing an echo, echo, echo, echo, echo.

1563
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:51,880
Give me a minute,

1564
01:50:51,880 --> 01:50:55,880

1565

Yeah, there's kinda screwin' it all up!

1566
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:05,880
Geez, Ron, don't cry till you pee your pants!

01:51:07,880 --> 01:51:09,880
I'll leave that to you, Stans.

1568
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:11,880
You sound like you're getting a little old there.

1569
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:13,880
You might be good at that point.

1570
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:17,880
Geez, you sound like a freakin' harpy!

1571
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:19,880
What the hell is going on?

1572
01:51:19,880 --> 01:51:21,880
I don't know, Stan! It's your fault!

1573
01:51:21,880 --> 01:51:37,880
Oh. Pardon me? My God, things have all gone cooky, cooky, dookie. All right, oh, there we go. Oh, no, that didn't work.

Well, well, well, God, I can't even do that for real, that's just freaky!

01:52:27,960 --> 01:52:29,960
I'm just ready to move on to the next segment.

1582
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:31,960
What, what, what, what, what?

1583
01:52:31,960 --> 01:52:33,960
What, what, what?

1584
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:37,960
Crayola sketches of your boobies.

1585
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:39,960
Dark Sakura.

1586
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:41,960
You know what?

1587
01:52:41,960 --> 01:52:43,960
And right there.

1588
01:52:43,960 --> 01:52:47,960
Hey, fellow broadcasters and VIPs listening tonight.

1589
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:51,960
There's your consideration clip for most unlikely to hear on AMFM radio.

1590
01:52:51,960 --> 01:52:53,960
Thank you.

1591
01:52:53,960 --> 01:53:04,640
this has been an orange lounge presentation oh hell all right we're

1592
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:07,680
gonna close the skype line for now but we will come back later I was gonna go

1593
01:53:07,680 --> 01:53:10,440
to another break but we're actually kind of starting to run behind and show so I

1594
01:53:10,440 --> 01:53:14,000
think we ought to just go into the next segment which is kind of weird but we're

1595
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,720
gonna go into the orange launch cage match because we need a break because my

1596
01:53:16,720 --> 01:53:21,000
face hurts from laughing seriously and some of our folks in our chat room are

1597
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:25,880
saying that too that they haven't left pants for your face you can be a butthead

1598
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:36,920
listen you all right um I'm sorry to those you guys didn't get through we

1599
01:53:36,920 --> 01:53:39,760
will open up the skype line at the end of the show if we have more time which

1600
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:43,080
I'm thinking we will if we can go ahead and move on to neuro next segment which

1601
01:53:43,080 --> 01:53:50,080
is the cage match. Alright, in tonight's cage match, we have a very interesting scenario

1602
01:53:51,820 --> 01:53:58,820
in tonight's cage match because we have a song going for a five week victory tonight.

1603
01:53:59,500 --> 01:54:05,520
It typically we retire a song after four weeks. However, this song has not been voted into

1604
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:10,320
a fourth week because we did not have a show last night. So we kind of decided that...

1605
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:12,320
Of course we didn't have one last night.

1606
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:14,320
Or last week, last week, sorry.

1607
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:16,320
Last night was under Sedation Live.

1608
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:18,320
I tried coming in last week.

1609
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:20,320
Yeah, I heard about you coming last week.

1610
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:25,320
Alright, so we have a song going for a five-week victory.

1611
01:54:25,320 --> 01:54:30,320
So if this song wins tonight, not only does it claim the first five-week victory,

1612
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:34,320
but will be the third song in Orange Lounge history to be retired.

1613
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:37,320
Alright, so again, a reminder, the way the cage match works,

1614
01:54:37,320 --> 01:54:41,260
works we play three songs for you guys last week's winner and two new songs we

1615
01:54:41,260 --> 01:54:44,580
play a clip of last week's winner two new songs in their entirety you guys

1616
01:54:44,580 --> 01:54:48,140
vote for your favorites and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on

1617
01:54:48,140 --> 01:54:52,020
orange lounge radio doesn't have to be a balani song doesn't have to have

1618
01:54:52,020 --> 01:54:56,140
anything to do with the money they're just songs that we think are cool but

1619
01:54:56,140 --> 01:54:59,980
you know what this cage match we do have a way of setting trends because may I

1620
01:54:59,980 --> 01:55:04,620
remind you what songs have we played in the cage match previously that went on

1621
01:55:04,620 --> 01:55:12,620
to win uh lava wherever you are uh delirium after all jason evans i'm in heaven with you

1622
01:55:12,620 --> 01:55:18,380
where did all these songs end up ddr so you never know what might become of the orange

1623
01:55:18,380 --> 01:55:23,900
lounge radio cage match so here it is going for its very maybe last win and retirement

1624
01:55:23,900 --> 01:55:30,900
yoko kano song number one with rise enjoy

1625
01:56:23,900 --> 01:56:33,900

And there you are dear, for the day

1627

On your feet, come with me

1629
01:56:43,900 --> 01:56:46,900
Be a song and no light

1630
01:56:46,900 --> 01:56:49,900
There you are dear, take your place

1631
01:56:49,900 --> 01:56:53,900
Please don't fall, I'm just missing

1632
01:56:53,900 --> 01:56:57,900
Some say I'm weak, but only it's time to make

1633
01:56:57,900 --> 01:57:01,900
Just a great fight

1634
01:57:01,900 --> 01:57:07,900
Here I go, bye

1635
01:57:15,900 --> 01:57:18,900
I'm a soldier from success

1636
01:57:18,900 --> 01:57:21,900
In this waking hell I am

1637
01:57:21,900 --> 01:57:27,900
Listening more than I can compute

1638
01:57:28,900 --> 01:57:31,900
Pray myself please don't forget

1639
01:57:31,900 --> 01:57:34,900
Life betrayed and be a threat

1640
01:57:34,900 --> 01:57:40,900
Please give me the strength to be a true hero

1641
01:57:40,900 --> 01:57:47,900
People placed in the fire together

1642
01:57:47,900 --> 01:58:15,660
All right, that was a clip of song number one, Yokokano Rise, possibly the third song

1643
01:58:45,660 --> 01:58:50,220
some of it is just way too cool I had to put one in the cage match so here it is

1644
01:58:50,220 --> 01:58:54,700

1645
01:58:54,700 --> 01:59:01,780

1646
01:59:24,700 --> 01:59:28,060
equipment looking for shelter readjust your position

1647
01:59:28,060 --> 01:59:31,820
thought control goes really confession two dimensions

1648
01:59:31,820 --> 01:59:35,500
dumb your hands down duck don't look now company missiles

1649
01:59:35,500 --> 01:59:39,500
power was watching when the cops are watching make your dreams not a paper

1650
01:59:39,500 --> 01:59:42,500
cliche, wasted, hate, taste test

1651
01:59:42,500 --> 01:59:46,500
hell yes, now I'm moving this way, I'm doing this thing

1652
01:59:46,500 --> 01:59:51,500
hell yes, now I'm turning it on, now I'm hooking my legs

1653
01:59:51,500 --> 01:59:56,500

Yeah, that's it.

1658
02:00:09,500 --> 02:00:17,540
Stretch to the limit, attention spans snap back, retract, collapse into live tracks,

1659
02:00:17,540 --> 02:00:22,700
noise response, applause and hand claps, floodgates open to the sound of the river,

1660
02:00:22,700 --> 02:00:27,540
breaking points on the verge of pointless, fools annoyed until the followers stand fair,

1661
02:00:27,540 --> 02:00:32,420
look for the common, not superficial, cold bread, cold or welcome home of the crisis,

1662
02:00:32,420 --> 02:00:37,700
for fuckery idols, rewriting the bibles, the magic market running out of the ink, lives

1663
02:00:37,700 --> 02:00:41,700
Turn the lights out, back to the scene answer, get your damn hands up

1664
02:00:41,700 --> 02:00:45,700
Hell yes, now I'm moving this way, I'm doing this thing

1665
02:00:45,700 --> 02:00:50,700
Hell yes, now I'm turning it on, now I'm working my legs

1666
02:00:50,700 --> 02:00:55,700
Hell yes, now I'm calling you out, I'm searching my place

1667
02:00:55,700 --> 02:01:00,700

1668
02:01:00,700 --> 02:01:01,700

Yeah that's it Yeah that's it

1673
02:01:09,700 --> 02:01:10,700
Yes Yeah

1674
02:01:10,700 --> 02:01:11,700
Yes Not gonna swim

1675
02:01:11,700 --> 02:01:15,700
I'm through with the spin Can you enjoy?

1676
02:01:15,700 --> 02:01:18,700
Hell yes Not too very dumb

1677
02:01:18,700 --> 02:01:24,700
I'm broken my legs It's a lie

1678
02:01:24,700 --> 02:01:42,700
Hell yes Now I'm taking it on, I'm working my legs

1679
02:01:42,700 --> 02:01:49,700
Hell yes Now I'm calling you out, I'm switching my place

1680
02:01:49,700 --> 02:01:50,700
Hell yes Now I'm creating a floor, my feet is cracked

1681
02:01:50,700 --> 02:01:55,100
the next song there. That was song number two, Ghetto Chip Malfunction by Beck. Let's

1682
02:01:55,100 --> 02:01:57,420
see what everybody thought of that. Dark Sakura.

1683
02:01:57,420 --> 02:02:03,900
That was pretty cool. It would give me a headache if I listened to it on repeat, which I would

1684
02:02:03,900 --> 02:02:08,280
probably do. So I would give it a nine. A very solid nine.

1685
02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:12,180
The EP actually has four songs on it all in that same style, so it's kind of cool.

1686
02:02:12,180 --> 02:02:15,740
Well, as long as I've been listening to very diverse things lately, that's right up my

1687
02:02:15,740 --> 02:02:16,740
alley, so yeah.

1688
02:02:16,740 --> 02:02:21,380
Very cool. Alright, let's see who's next. Who else has got a mic? Who's got a mic over there? Jonas!

1689
02:02:21,380 --> 02:02:28,980
Let's see. Orgasmic Nostalgia. It's pretty good. I like it. A nine. A nine! Alright.

1690
02:02:28,980 --> 02:02:35,540
Sharks Girl. That was pretty nifty, and I don't normally like that. So, I think the remix part

1691
02:02:35,540 --> 02:02:39,700
of it made it really kind of cool, and I liked the hell yes at the end. I was like, oh nifty!

1692
02:02:39,700 --> 02:02:52,900
so uh 9.3759 okay uh islander i i think i'd give it i wouldn't quite give it a nine though

1693
02:02:52,900 --> 02:03:01,140
i'd give it an eight all right an eight mel i like the production a lot i'm a sucker for a nice uh

1694
02:03:01,140 --> 02:03:06,340
kick drum you know kick drum machine type sound with uh some nice the hard synths in it i'd give

1695
02:03:06,340 --> 02:03:16,860
give it a nice 9.4. All right. Loki. It's an 8. Angel. It's Beck, it's a 9. I actually

1696
02:03:16,860 --> 02:03:21,140
don't typically care for Beck a whole lot. I mean, he's okay, but again, the 8-bit thing

1697
02:03:21,140 --> 02:03:28,220
does it for me. I love it. Please enjoy. 9. All right. Let's see if song number 3 is going

1698
02:03:28,220 --> 02:03:34,820
to win tonight, and song number 3 is Loki's pick. Loki, what did you pick for us tonight?

1699
02:03:34,820 --> 02:03:37,380
My computer's down right now, it's in pieces.

1700
02:03:37,380 --> 02:03:40,060
Please don't let it be Papa Smurf lick my ass.

1701
02:03:40,060 --> 02:03:44,580
I already submitted that one, so that doesn't work.

1702
02:03:44,580 --> 02:03:45,800
No, um...

1703
02:03:45,800 --> 02:03:50,660
This song, I had Jimmy find me a song real quick.

1704
02:03:50,660 --> 02:03:52,780
And...

1705
02:03:52,780 --> 02:03:54,100
That's right, folks.

1706
02:03:54,100 --> 02:03:55,340
It's GIRLS!

1707
02:03:55,340 --> 02:03:56,180
Enjoy!

1708
02:04:25,340 --> 02:04:35,340
Right now, right now, right now

1709
02:04:35,340 --> 02:05:03,340
Right now, right now, right now, right now.

1710
02:07:33,340 --> 02:07:48,340
Okay, so how appropriate that the last show at this studio will have prodigy with girls, the still shot mix this time in the cage match. What do we think of the still shot mix? Dark Sakura.

1711
02:07:48,340 --> 02:07:58,340
It's a mix of that song that doesn't completely suck donkey ass, which is double ass if you think about it. So it gets an 8.

1712
02:07:58,340 --> 02:08:02,620
Get it donkey ass ass ass and then eight from dark soccer Jonas

1713
02:08:04,900 --> 02:08:08,340
Sorry, it's trying to go in the same order I agree the remix is very great

1714
02:08:08,340 --> 02:08:14,580
So I like the big beat into it. So I'll give it a nine. All right sharks girl

1715
02:08:15,380 --> 02:08:19,780
I'm feeling generous in that freaking own pen. Whoo Islander

1716
02:08:20,860 --> 02:08:22,860
Don't have a mouthful of cake. I'll say nine

1717
02:08:22,860 --> 02:08:29,860
I was feeling that beat man, it's like a throwback to the early 80's Africa Bambata type hip-hop,

1718
02:08:31,780 --> 02:08:36,460
old school break beat type stuff. If I had more room here I'd do a head spin so I'd give

1719
02:08:36,460 --> 02:08:43,460
it a 9, 10. Alright, Loki! It gets a 9 and that belt gets a 10. Alright, and you know

1720
02:08:43,460 --> 02:08:54,460
I hate to be the party pooper, but I was only feeling that song for about the first minute.

1721
02:08:54,460 --> 02:08:58,460
And once the vocals came in, it kind of lost me, so I can only really give it like a 6.5.

1722
02:08:58,460 --> 02:08:59,460
Angel?

1723
02:08:59,460 --> 02:09:02,460
For the beat, I'd give it a 7.

1724
02:09:02,460 --> 02:09:03,460
Alright.

1725
02:09:03,460 --> 02:09:08,460
Very tough decision tonight, you guys, but here it is, the three songs you get to vote for.

1726
02:09:08,460 --> 02:09:11,660
Song number one, Yokokano with Rise.

1727
02:09:11,660 --> 02:09:18,660
That's a bad clip. Let me try another clip.

1728
02:09:23,180 --> 02:09:26,980
Alright, song number two you can vote for tonight is Beck with Ghetto Chip

Send a private message to Sky with your vote. Song number one, Yoko Kanno. Song number two, Beck. Song number three, Prodigy.

1738
02:10:15,780 --> 02:10:17,780
My butt! I mean, Prodigy.

1739
02:10:17,780 --> 02:10:29,780
Alright. Now, Loki, I know you've had kind of a dramatic week and a lot of stuff going on, but you know I have to ask, this is the point of the show where I always want to know, what's going on in the Sim scene?

1740
02:10:29,780 --> 02:10:47,780
Well, there's a few things actually. There was XXMix came out. It's another Japanese like fan mix type thing. It's kind of cool. They've got some pretty interesting songs in there. They have a really good remix of 501, a really shitty remix of Celebrate Night, so it kind of evens out.

1741
02:10:47,780 --> 02:10:57,780
You can find the link for that on BamaiStyle under the wonderful Japanese fan mix, like food mix thread, and that's in there.

1742
02:10:57,780 --> 02:11:04,780
And then also, there was, oh man, what the? SiberiaStyle 2.5 came out, that's also StepMania skin.

1743
02:11:04,780 --> 02:11:13,780
Sort of resembles Technofeen, it's pretty good. I haven't really noticed any differences between the 2.5 and 2, but yeah, download it anyways, it's pretty good.

1744
02:11:13,780 --> 02:11:20,780
That's pretty much it for now. Oh, and DDR UK's back up. But, eh, whatever.

1745
02:11:21,780 --> 02:11:29,780
Alright. Wow, this is tough because I'm trying to tally votes from tonight's cage match here, so somebody's got to help me fill time.

1746
02:11:29,780 --> 02:11:31,780
Dark Sakura, tell them about some of the other people...

1747
02:11:31,780 --> 02:11:33,780
I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts.

1748
02:11:33,780 --> 02:11:35,780
Tell them about some of the lovely...

1749
02:11:37,780 --> 02:11:39,780
What am I supposed to tell people about?

1750
02:11:39,780 --> 02:11:41,780
Some of the other lovely programming we have on Orange Laundry.

1751
02:11:41,780 --> 02:11:45,780
Yeah, we do other shows. Do we still do Diversion on Monday?

1752
02:11:45,780 --> 02:11:46,780
Yes, we are.

1753
02:11:46,780 --> 02:11:50,780
Okay, there's Diversion on Monday and it starts whenever the hell it feels like playing it.

1754
02:11:50,780 --> 02:11:56,780
And then on Tuesday, I do pump up the volume, which is actually Gorillaz Marathon. I'm sorry.

1755
02:11:56,780 --> 02:12:02,780
Which is actually whatever I feel like playing at the time, or whatever the chat room requests.

1756
02:12:02,780 --> 02:12:08,780
It's really supposed to be your request show, but no one ever requests anything except for really bizarre shit I don't have.

1757
02:12:08,780 --> 02:12:11,740
Although I do have a bunch of bizarre stuff.

1758
02:12:11,740 --> 02:12:15,180
Pre-show starts at a quarter to seven, the show starts at seven thirty to ten thirty,

1759
02:12:15,180 --> 02:12:19,380
or whenever the hell I feel like passing out.

1760
02:12:19,380 --> 02:12:22,780
This Tuesday, by the way, I will not be doing the show on Tuesday.

1761
02:12:22,780 --> 02:12:25,900
I will be doing it another night.

1762
02:12:25,900 --> 02:12:30,780
Because my ass take a night off on my birthday, so fuck that.

1763
02:12:30,780 --> 02:12:35,460
So you can check our Orange Lounge LiveJournal community for the information on when the

1764
02:12:35,460 --> 02:12:37,020
show will be rescheduled for.

1765
02:12:37,020 --> 02:12:39,020
Yeah, responsible bullshit.

1766
02:12:39,020 --> 02:12:43,020
Next up is Rob's show, Outside the Box.

1767
02:12:43,020 --> 02:12:47,020
Yes, but Outside the Box is actually on hiatus until the station relaunch in May.

1768
02:12:47,020 --> 02:12:49,020
So it comes on eventually.

1769
02:12:49,020 --> 02:12:51,020
Yes, eventually. You have to look forward to that.

1770
02:12:51,020 --> 02:12:56,020
Well, maybe we'll have to make some type of arrangement.

1771
02:12:56,020 --> 02:12:59,020
I will be doing my show just on a different night.

1772
02:13:02,020 --> 02:13:06,020
And then we do the repeat thingy.

1773
02:13:06,020 --> 02:13:10,540
on DDR Freak actually. That's indeed right, I just want to make a mention.

1774
02:13:10,540 --> 02:13:14,160
And we actually have a lot of people that listen over on DDR Freak, and so

1775
02:13:14,160 --> 02:13:18,000
as kind of a thank you to you guys over on DDR Freak for making us kind of a

1776
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:23,300
popular little spin-off over on DDR Freak Radio, we actually now are on same-week

1777
02:13:23,300 --> 02:13:24,380
rotation.

1778
02:13:24,380 --> 02:13:28,180
So because of the fact that we didn't have a show last week, we used it as a chance to

1779
02:13:28,180 --> 02:13:31,840
clean the gap there on DDR Freak. So now you are hearing,

1780
02:13:31,840 --> 02:13:35,460
when you hear this show, this is the show that we did that same Sunday. You don't

1781
02:13:35,460 --> 02:13:38,220
to wait a week anymore you're actually getting the show the same week we did it

1782
02:13:38,220 --> 02:13:47,100
and you'll be hearing it in like full mp3 pro quality yes yes so because they

1783
02:13:47,100 --> 02:13:49,820
have they have very good quality over there at DDR freak radio so you get a

1784
02:13:49,820 --> 02:13:55,260
good quality yeah I'd say it's a pretty nice operation run over there yeah and

1785
02:13:55,260 --> 02:14:02,180
then we have our new spin-off ferret radio actually um we are as when we

1786
02:14:02,180 --> 02:14:05,740
relaunch in May and kind of things you know take over again we're going to be

1787
02:14:05,740 --> 02:14:11,420
kind of looking for new talent to do some new shows so you know maybe we need

1788
02:14:11,420 --> 02:14:16,620
to be doing orange lounge idol oh yeah so we'll see what happens we have so if

1789
02:14:16,620 --> 02:14:22,260
you want to be a part of the best of 2005 nominated Orange Lounge radio we're

1790
02:14:22,260 --> 02:14:25,500
gonna have opportunities coming up and it doesn't have to be about Bahmani

1791
02:14:25,500 --> 02:14:30,800
anything gaming related in the slightest we're gonna take so we'll have more

1792
02:14:30,800 --> 02:14:36,860
details on that coming soon so and don't forget about the the kick the ultra Kade

1793
02:14:36,860 --> 02:14:41,900
but oh yes we have that too yes we need more pictures of people kicking ultra

1794
02:14:41,900 --> 02:14:47,540
Kade machines those bits are trying to steal the main name yeah I think some of

1795
02:14:47,540 --> 02:14:50,840
that got settled and that's not happening but it's still funny so the

1796
02:14:50,840 --> 02:14:55,180
fact that the dude tried and he was such a complete retard because the name was

1797
02:14:55,180 --> 02:15:00,300
already registered and already somebody else's invention so yeah kick you know

1798
02:15:00,300 --> 02:15:05,300
So, kick an Ultra Cave machine out of love for Orange Lounge and send me the picture.

1799
02:15:05,300 --> 02:15:06,300
Alright.

1800
02:15:06,300 --> 02:15:07,300
Sounds good.

1801
02:15:07,300 --> 02:15:12,180
And only one person has voted for us on Podcast Alley tonight, so I hope that maybe some of

1802
02:15:12,180 --> 02:15:15,100
the rest of you guys are just waiting on those email confirmations.

1803
02:15:15,100 --> 02:15:16,260
They won't spam you.

1804
02:15:16,260 --> 02:15:20,300
There is completely nothing to vote for us over on Podcast Alley.

1805
02:15:20,300 --> 02:15:21,300
Please do.

1806
02:15:21,300 --> 02:15:22,300
We'd appreciate it.

1807
02:15:22,300 --> 02:15:23,820
Alright, let's hear it.

1808
02:15:23,820 --> 02:15:25,620
You guys want to hear tonight's winner of the Cage Match?

1809
02:15:25,620 --> 02:15:26,620
Ah, sure.

1810
02:15:26,620 --> 02:15:27,620
Alright.

1811
02:15:27,620 --> 02:15:29,100
Now, here's the interesting thing.

1812
02:15:29,100 --> 02:15:34,280
votes tonight than any other cage match in orange launch radio history so this

1813
02:15:34,280 --> 02:15:37,740
was now and I and somebody in the chat room actually called me on it said sky

1814
02:15:37,740 --> 02:15:41,860
you say it every week that the cage match is a hard one to decide tonight

1815
02:15:41,860 --> 02:15:46,220
definitely is the case because of so many votes more votes tonight than any

1816
02:15:46,220 --> 02:15:50,140
other night what is the winner

1817
02:15:52,060 --> 02:15:58,960
yoko kano goes into retirement with a fifth week and now that I think about it

1818
02:15:58,960 --> 02:16:02,880
we have no show next week six weeks that song will have been a cage match victor

1819
02:16:02,880 --> 02:16:08,160
six weeks you guys have called that song a lot of people in history a lot of

1820
02:16:08,160 --> 02:16:11,640
people in their comments actually said it deserves retirement I'm only voting

1821
02:16:11,640 --> 02:16:16,240
for it because it deserves to be retired so there you go

1822
02:16:23,120 --> 02:16:26,960
I think it's a but this is nice because now Loki has had one song retired

1823
02:16:26,960 --> 02:16:30,500
realize that I'm going to have to have like one of those head braces because my

1824
02:16:30,500 --> 02:16:34,520
egos gonna fall out of proportion this is I'm going to look like the head this

1825
02:16:34,520 --> 02:16:38,380
is a nice note to end on because with the whole we are starting over joke we

1826
02:16:38,380 --> 02:16:41,480
have going tonight because Loki has now had one song retired echo image come

1827
02:16:41,480 --> 02:16:45,760
back I have had one song retired Gwen Stefani what you waiting for and yeah

1828
02:16:45,760 --> 02:16:50,040
dark dark Sakura has now had one song retired with yoko Kano with rise so

1829
02:16:50,040 --> 02:16:56,600
we've all had one song retired and so when we come back in on May 1st cage

1830
02:16:56,600 --> 02:17:01,600
Kage Match starts over. Kage Match starts new. Three brand new songs are going to be in it, so it'll be interesting.

1831
02:17:01,600 --> 02:17:06,600
We're going to have to change up the theme. We'll have to do something. We'll have to work on that over the next couple weeks. Change up the theme.

1832
02:17:06,600 --> 02:17:14,600
Oh, and by the way, since I made a mention of this to Rob and Loki earlier, I do want to actually give a shout out to some of our listeners.

1833
02:17:14,600 --> 02:17:18,600
This is some of our UK listeners. Hi.

1834
02:17:18,600 --> 02:17:24,320
Yes, actually, I... the cool... is such a cool thing about doing this radio show, and

1835
02:17:24,320 --> 02:17:27,400
I know a lot of times we talk about, like, Sacramento things, and things we're doing

1836
02:17:27,400 --> 02:17:30,880
in Sacramento, gaming and some of that, and Bay Area, because we're just across the street

1837
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:35,960
from the Bay Area, pretty much. We've got listeners in Canada, as you found out tonight,

1838
02:17:35,960 --> 02:17:38,880
we have that caller from Ghetto. We've got listeners in the UK, we've gotten some email

1839
02:17:38,880 --> 02:17:43,960
from the UK. We've gotten some listeners in Japan, too. Japan is actually one of our biggest

1840
02:17:43,960 --> 02:17:46,980
country representations. I believe our number... our third most listed country. I think number

1841
02:17:46,980 --> 02:17:52,300
three behind U.S. and Canada, actually. I think U.K. or England itself is actually number

1842
02:17:52,300 --> 02:17:53,300
four.

1843
02:17:53,300 --> 02:17:54,300
Yep.

1844
02:17:54,300 --> 02:18:00,060
So, you know, and I wanted to stop and make that mention to our listeners in, you know,

1845
02:18:00,060 --> 02:18:04,620
in non-United States countries, because, you know, even though we go off on everything

1846
02:18:04,620 --> 02:18:07,680
happening over here, we're still thinking of you guys, so thank you for listening to

1847
02:18:07,680 --> 02:18:12,260
us and for blowing up my ego to astronomical proportions.

1848
02:18:12,260 --> 02:18:18,260
Alright, now, we have a choice for what we can do next week for the cage match. We're

1849
02:18:18,260 --> 02:18:24,100
gonna have a pre-taped show, so there's two things we can do. A, we have, it's gonna be

1850
02:18:24,100 --> 02:18:29,740
a pre-taped cage match next week, um, and we will actually do the voting on our website.

1851
02:18:29,740 --> 02:18:34,100
So there's two choices we can do for that. We can do A, the ultimate cage match with

1852
02:18:34,100 --> 02:18:38,420
all the retired songs, and choose a victor between all three of those retired songs.

1853
02:18:38,420 --> 02:18:42,420
Of course then it wouldn't be a surprise what you're going to hear or choice number two

1854
02:18:42,420 --> 02:18:47,820
and the chat room has been begging us to do this for about 70 weeks now, reverse cage

1855
02:18:47,820 --> 02:18:50,060
match number two.

1856
02:18:50,060 --> 02:18:52,980
What do you think?

1857
02:18:52,980 --> 02:18:53,980
Reverse cage match.

1858
02:18:53,980 --> 02:18:58,980
It would be good to end season four with the retirees.

1859
02:18:58,980 --> 02:19:00,900
We have three retirees now, right?

1860
02:19:00,900 --> 02:19:01,900
Yup.

1861
02:19:01,900 --> 02:19:03,900
Why not do both?

1862
02:19:03,900 --> 02:19:07,900
Alright, we're going to do both next week.

1863
02:19:07,900 --> 02:19:08,900
So there'll be two cage matches.

1864
02:19:08,900 --> 02:19:09,900
Because we love you guys!

1865
02:19:09,900 --> 02:19:12,980
Double ultimate secret cage match!

1866
02:19:12,980 --> 02:19:18,820
We'll do the retirees to end season four, and we'll do the reverse cage match to start

1867
02:19:18,820 --> 02:19:19,820
season five.

1868
02:19:19,820 --> 02:19:22,420
Actually, this is season five that's ending right now, season five.

1869
02:19:22,420 --> 02:19:23,860
Well, it's season six!

1870
02:19:23,860 --> 02:19:24,860
Sorry.

1871
02:19:24,860 --> 02:19:26,860
So season five will come to an end with two season matches.

1872
02:19:26,860 --> 02:19:27,860
The season of Satan!

1873
02:19:27,860 --> 02:19:29,460
This is like a reality show finale.

1874
02:19:29,460 --> 02:19:33,940
Now for those with confused looks on their faces, what's a reverse cage match?

1875
02:19:33,940 --> 02:19:39,420
That is where we pick three songs and the winning song is banned from Orange Lounge

1876
02:19:39,420 --> 02:19:41,980
Radio and will never be played again.

1877
02:19:41,980 --> 02:19:51,020
In the last reverse cage match, which took place on episode 69, it was complicated from

1878
02:19:51,020 --> 02:19:55,820
Dance Mania Speed 9, was banned from the station forever.

1879
02:19:55,820 --> 02:19:59,660
So the speed mix of complicated was banned from the station forever.

1880
02:19:59,660 --> 02:20:00,660
We will not play it.

1881
02:20:00,660 --> 02:20:08,300
Both coming back next week. It's gonna be a two-cage match week. All right, so look

1882
02:20:08,300 --> 02:20:15,860
for that. All right, um, I think we need to go to a break. I need to break

1883
02:20:15,860 --> 02:20:18,780
something. Yeah, we need a break. When we come back, we're gonna have the FUs of

1884
02:20:18,780 --> 02:20:23,740
the week and maybe a couple more Skype calls. Ask Orange Lounge, we have to do

1885
02:20:23,740 --> 02:20:28,760
one more of those in the studio, and whatever else we think of. So we'll be

1886
02:20:28,760 --> 02:20:38,360
back after this in this break what's a fun theme to do for this break let's see

1887
02:20:38,360 --> 02:20:42,000

02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
To all you fellas, this is just a game

1915
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
Mackin' to the ladies tryin' to build your name

Wanna be a player tryin' to get a piece

I'll break your neck if I catch a disease

1918
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
Round town soybeans like a farmer

1919
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
You better beware your baby mama

1920
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:50,000
Who dat is?

1921
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:51,000

1923
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:53,000
My baby mama

1924
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:54,000
Now who dat is?

1925
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:55,000
My baby mama

1926
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:56,000
No, who dat is?

1927
02:23:56,000 --> 02:24:03,000
Know Who That Is

1928
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:51,000
The last that ever she saw it Carried away by a moonlight

1929
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:55,000
She had a bad song, worried and warning

1930
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:58,000
Carried away by a moonlight

1931
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
She had a chance to look in the riddle

1932
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
There's a Saturday night

1933
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:05,000
Far away on the other side

1934
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:08,000
She was caught in the middle of a different spot

1935
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:12,000
And she couldn't find how to push through

1936
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:16,000
She sang for an evening

1937
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
Carried away by a moonlight

1938
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
She had a sad song

1939
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:24,000
Cold and breathing, carried away

1940
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:29,000
By the moonlight shadow, she saw what's been when it's gone

1941
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:32,000
Far away on the other side

1942
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:36,000
He was shot six times by the man on the run

1943
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:40,000
And she couldn't find how he pushed through

1944
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:43,000
I said, I said, I prayed

1945
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:46,000
Are you in heaven one day?

1946
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:50,000
Day falling and it's morning

1947
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:53,000
Coming your way, by a moonlight shed

1948
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:57,000
I want your vision burning

1949
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:00,000
Coming your way, by a moonlight shed

1950
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:03,000
Shed, shed, shed, shed, shed, shed, shed, shed

1951
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:09,000
Gaming Radio, so uncensored

1952
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:12,000
That even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us

1953
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:15,500
Mooch, uh, moo-caw-key, Orange Lounge Radio.

1954
02:27:15,500 --> 02:27:18,500
Pack gun.

1955
02:27:18,500 --> 02:27:22,500
All right, we are back here with Orange Lounge Radio.

1956
02:27:22,500 --> 02:27:29,500
Currently, a radio dedicated to all things Bomani and then some, but in two weeks, what gamers really want to know.

1957
02:27:29,500 --> 02:27:33,500
The live show here, what we've got going on in this three hour program, it's not going to really change.

1958
02:27:33,500 --> 02:27:38,500
We still are going to be the source, the premier internet radio source for DDR and other music and rhythm game news.

1959
02:27:38,500 --> 02:27:40,500
We're not going to change what we're doing Sunday nights.

1960
02:27:40,500 --> 02:27:45,180
it's just the change is going to affect the podcast which you know this kind of

1961
02:27:45,180 --> 02:27:48,300
already happened if you listen to this week's episode and it also is going to

1962
02:27:48,300 --> 02:27:50,780
affect the rest of what you're on the station we're gonna be looking for new

1963
02:27:50,780 --> 02:27:56,180
shows to kind of expand we want to be the video gaming internet radio station

1964
02:27:56,180 --> 02:28:00,420
the station so we're kind of excited about it so we're looking forward to it

1965
02:28:00,420 --> 02:28:06,620
we are gonna have the biggest adjective ever and we know that the only way we're

1966
02:28:06,620 --> 02:28:10,520
gonna achieve this is with your guys's help and because we have an awesome

1967
02:28:10,520 --> 02:28:13,940
listening base there is no way in hell we would ever have been nominated to the

1968
02:28:13,940 --> 02:28:17,140
best of life 365 Awards without our listening base and all these other

1969
02:28:17,140 --> 02:28:24,180
things we do you guys rock love you guys kisses alright so that being said let's

1970
02:28:24,180 --> 02:28:30,060
go from the lovey-dovey chat to the angst and hatred chat that you guys have

1971
02:28:30,060 --> 02:28:34,700
come to know and love and hopefully this won't be directed at the listeners

1972
02:28:34,700 --> 02:28:39,200
tonight I think we might want to leave on a good note here so dark Sakura why

1973
02:28:39,200 --> 02:28:44,940
is it that we always do these f-use of the week every single week

1974
02:28:44,940 --> 02:29:08,540
Okay, big F you to people who drive ten miles under the speed limit when I'm driving twenty

1975
02:29:08,540 --> 02:29:09,540
over.

1976
02:29:09,540 --> 02:29:16,700
An F.U. to my driver's side window that keeps rolling down, and a sap that fell all over

1977
02:29:16,700 --> 02:29:25,460
my car windows in a sticky manner that has faded put little droplets all over my window.

1978
02:29:25,460 --> 02:29:32,420
F.U. to being bored by just about everything since the semester is almost over, school

1979
02:29:32,420 --> 02:29:36,340
has gotten into the really boring yet really hectic phase where, oh my god I gotta get

1980
02:29:36,340 --> 02:29:42,800
all the shit done you know if you do my allergies in the springtime in general

1981
02:29:42,800 --> 02:29:52,060
and if you to living in my crappy apartment with my interesting neighbors

1982
02:29:52,060 --> 02:30:01,360
and I mean interest by interesting I mean totally sucky no my neighbors think

1983
02:30:01,360 --> 02:30:11,360
are all thug gangsters. Yeah. Um, and as, I mean, the really wannabe thinking they are.

1984
02:30:11,360 --> 02:30:16,360
It's a really annoying kind. If they really were, I'd think, oh well that's kind of awesome,

1985
02:30:16,360 --> 02:30:27,360
but no. So. Um, yeah, and uh, I want to go back to Alabama. Cause I need grit. I'm done.

1986
02:30:27,360 --> 02:30:32,360
Alright, Loki!

1987
02:30:32,360 --> 02:30:37,360
Fuck you to moving! I hate moving! Moving sucks!

1988
02:30:37,360 --> 02:30:42,360
Honestly, I mean, let's see, let's start off with people that drive slow.

1989
02:30:42,360 --> 02:30:47,360
Every single person, old person, person in a truck, always driving goddamn slow.

1990
02:30:47,360 --> 02:30:52,360
And I'm doing, honestly, I'm doing like the speed limit because I don't want to go crazy with my car and stuff,

1991
02:30:52,360 --> 02:30:57,440
a ton of, you know, boxes in and stuff I can't see out the back window or anything like that.

1992
02:30:57,440 --> 02:31:02,800
So, you know, I've been doing pretty good, you know, but these guys are going like twenty

1993
02:31:02,800 --> 02:31:09,420
in a goddamn fifty, okay? Stuff like that. It's so awful. Um, then, also, to the fact

1994
02:31:09,420 --> 02:31:13,960
that I have just so much crap to pack, that just really sucks. Pucking in my apartment

1995
02:31:13,960 --> 02:31:20,380
for having a air conditioning unit right next to the bedroom, um, that sounds like a jet

1996
02:31:20,380 --> 02:31:21,980
engine

1997
02:31:21,980 --> 02:31:26,800
firing up uh... in the middle it went some bastard upstairs wanted air

1998
02:31:26,800 --> 02:31:30,280
i mean it's not that hot outside and he's fucking

1999
02:31:30,280 --> 02:31:32,660
terrier is off

2000
02:31:32,660 --> 02:31:34,860
well i got

2001
02:31:34,860 --> 02:31:37,700
dead-end no anyway

2002
02:31:37,700 --> 02:31:41,620
i think we could have a good i can't believe through anything but you know

2003
02:31:41,620 --> 02:31:45,540
my you know fiance cannot and

2004
02:31:45,540 --> 02:31:48,280
no didn't like that too much

2005
02:31:48,280 --> 02:31:49,700
also uh...

2006
02:31:49,700 --> 02:31:52,360
the fact that uh...

2007
02:31:52,360 --> 02:31:55,080
my car's check engine light came on

2008
02:31:55,080 --> 02:31:56,180
why

2009
02:31:56,180 --> 02:31:57,700
why now

2010
02:31:57,700 --> 02:32:01,180
especially now that you know moving costs money

2011
02:32:01,180 --> 02:32:04,920
fixing a car is not exactly the agenda

2012
02:32:04,920 --> 02:32:06,460
things are pretty tight as it is

2013
02:32:06,460 --> 02:32:11,080
hope nothing majorly wrong is with my car

2014
02:32:11,080 --> 02:32:15,900
if it's something really bad i can take it to the dealership and they'll fix it

2015
02:32:15,900 --> 02:32:21,300
you know because I've got that extended warranty that thank God I bought I don't

2016
02:32:21,300 --> 02:32:25,100
know it just really sucks sucks that I'm also gonna be without internet for you

2017
02:32:25,100 --> 02:32:29,520
know a couple days and cable TV and that kind of stuff but I'll live since I'm

2018
02:32:29,520 --> 02:32:33,820
gonna be packing and moving shit for the next few days that sucks

2019
02:32:33,820 --> 02:32:38,940
that's me to that goddamn TV for being so fucking heavy I mean this TV is like

2020
02:32:38,940 --> 02:32:44,860
I think it's a 27 inch TV or something and it weighs a ton it's like we

2021
02:32:44,860 --> 02:32:51,860
We comprise our TV of solid lead and spent uranium.

2022
02:32:51,860 --> 02:32:56,860
It's like, I don't understand why that TV's gotta be so damn heavy, but it is.

2023
02:32:56,860 --> 02:32:59,860
And then, um, let's see what else.

2024
02:32:59,860 --> 02:33:11,860
Oh, fuck you, the, um, mutated, ugly, um, bitch next door that, um, rented me my U-Haul truck because, um, I rented it online, you know, I reserved a 14-foot truck.

2025
02:33:11,860 --> 02:33:17,740
there I've been trying to call you and I couldn't get hold of you well I had you

2026
02:33:17,740 --> 02:33:22,380
know I gave you know my work number and my home number I never heard a call over

2027
02:33:22,380 --> 02:33:27,940
here now I've been sitting here packing she's like we don't have a 14 foot truck

2028
02:33:27,940 --> 02:33:32,340
you have to take 10 I'm like okay fine I'll take the 10 foot truck are you gonna be

2029
02:33:32,340 --> 02:33:37,960
driving at night cuz they don't got one headlight like okay fine I'll take the

2030
02:33:37,960 --> 02:33:43,960
gimp truck so then I take the gimp truck drive it around the fucking you know

2031
02:33:43,960 --> 02:33:48,420
everything's breaking those things like oh my god let's get this packed and done

2032
02:33:48,420 --> 02:33:52,320
with you know before the truck falls apart we can get it back to her and

2033
02:33:52,320 --> 02:33:58,320
honestly we drove a total of seven miles seven miles the gas gauge is full it's

2034
02:33:58,320 --> 02:34:04,000
still on full we get there you'll go it's that my pride in you fill it up I'm

2035
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:07,840
I'm charging you $3 for gas!

2036
02:34:07,840 --> 02:34:09,200
For seven miles!

2037
02:34:09,200 --> 02:34:13,080
I mean, granted, I understand, you know, this might be like an SUV,

2038
02:34:13,080 --> 02:34:17,840
but, you know, I don't think I use $7 for the gas driving seven miles.

2039
02:34:17,840 --> 02:34:20,240
Or, you know, $3 for the gas, whatever it is.

2040
02:34:20,240 --> 02:34:22,220
I mean, shit.

2041
02:34:22,220 --> 02:34:28,000
Oh, and not to mention that the truck cost me $19.99 to start off with, $1.19 a mile,

2042
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,720
$7 for the goddamn dolly,

2043
02:34:30,720 --> 02:34:33,400
And then $5 for convenience fee for on-

2044
02:34:33,400 --> 02:34:36,680
What the fuck, I got charged $5 for convenience fee online!

2045
02:34:36,680 --> 02:34:40,400
Not to get the same truck I want, instead I get a gimp truck.

2046
02:34:40,400 --> 02:34:41,520
What the fuck is that?

2047
02:34:41,520 --> 02:34:43,920
Where's Jamie when you need her, because she would be yelling at you-

2048
02:34:43,920 --> 02:34:46,160
She would be filing a complaint for you right now.

2049
02:34:47,360 --> 02:34:48,760
Here she comes!

2050
02:34:50,520 --> 02:34:52,520

2054
02:35:07,460 --> 02:35:11,120
for anyone that's out there that's seen Men in Black, okay, you know there's a point in

2055
02:35:11,120 --> 02:35:17,440
the movie where this evil alien thing takes over a human host body and kind of does this

2056
02:35:17,440 --> 02:35:21,600
weird face, you know, jarring thing with his face and was like, ahhh, you know, she kept

2057
02:35:21,600 --> 02:35:26,080
making that, like, look, you know, all of a sudden, it's a three hour show, run down

2058
02:35:26,080 --> 02:35:33,080
to rent the truck, which isn't even the right truck that I rented, $1.19 per mile, $7 for

2059
02:35:34,280 --> 02:35:39,540
the dolly, and $5 convenience fee for a truck that, you know, I rented, I reserved a 14-foot

2060
02:35:39,540 --> 02:35:42,700
truck, she gave me a gimp 10-foot truck with one headlight.

2061
02:35:42,700 --> 02:35:47,700
Talk to your manager, write the Better Business Bureau, send a copy of the letter to her so

2062
02:35:47,700 --> 02:35:52,020
you can send it to the Better Business Bureau and keep a damn copy.

2063
02:35:52,020 --> 02:35:59,020
That's why I love having her around, because she'll just... she'll tell you how to fuck with somebody.

2064
02:35:59,020 --> 02:36:02,020
I live to prove people wrong.

2065
02:36:02,020 --> 02:36:07,020
Oh, and then to top it off, at the very end of when I got done dealing with her...

2066
02:36:07,020 --> 02:36:10,020
Do you know I need high schoolers at my...

2067

02:37:23,680 --> 02:37:25,680
yeah, and

2089
02:37:26,440 --> 02:37:30,720

2094
02:37:56,880 --> 02:38:03,680
but I found out later through lab journal that the only reason that they

2095
02:38:03,680 --> 02:38:09,040
were charging $50 to get into the place was the fact that they had some

2096
02:38:09,040 --> 02:38:15,160
basketball player there that was signing autographs I'm going the hell all right

2097

Daniel says, F.U. to my ex-wife for making my life a living hell.

2200
02:46:17,560 --> 02:46:20,480
And I think that's a good one to, uh, end the F.U. segment on exes.

2201
02:46:20,480 --> 02:46:27,480
I have no pity for the people who haven't gotten their tax money yet. Sorry Jonas, cause I did mine like 3 months ago.

2202
02:46:27,480 --> 02:46:32,480
And if he goes to taxes for not sending me my refunds yet, I filed my taxes like 2 months ago and still haven't got my refund.

2203
02:46:32,480 --> 02:46:41,480
And if he did his dog for pissing on my tires, this is not piss my ride dammit!

2204
02:46:41,480 --> 02:46:48,040
I have no pity for the people who haven't gotten their tax money yet, sorry Jonas, because

2205
02:46:48,040 --> 02:46:54,440
I did mine like three months ago and I got my money two months ago.

2206
02:46:54,440 --> 02:47:07,960
If you hop on it right when you get it and telephile, you get your money awfully fast.

2207
02:47:07,960 --> 02:47:11,920
So I e-filed, and I had to owe, so does that mean they're not going to take out my money

2208
02:47:11,920 --> 02:47:14,540
for another couple weeks?

2209
02:47:14,540 --> 02:47:16,780
Do they take money out of your account?

2210
02:47:16,780 --> 02:47:19,580
I end up owing all the time, because I have two main deductions.

2211
02:47:19,580 --> 02:47:25,060
See, I always have zero, and this year I got, I don't want to brag, but my return was four

2212
02:47:25,060 --> 02:47:26,060
digits.

2213
02:47:26,060 --> 02:47:27,060
So, yeah.

2214
02:47:27,060 --> 02:47:28,060
Yeah, see, that's what I need to do.

2215
02:47:28,060 --> 02:47:29,060
But I have Max's holdings.

2216
02:47:29,060 --> 02:47:30,060
I need to drop it down to like one.

2217
02:47:30,060 --> 02:47:31,060
All right.

2218
02:47:31,060 --> 02:47:37,880
I would also like to say that I now have no credit, we have no credit card debt.

2219
02:47:37,880 --> 02:47:44,340
so happy hahaha all right guys I could have had a larger refund of fucking

2220
02:47:44,340 --> 02:47:51,520
golf lane and fuck me over all right um ten more minutes left in the show you

2221
02:47:51,520 --> 02:47:56,480
guys and it's kind of the end of the season the end of a big chapter here in

2222
02:47:56,480 --> 02:47:59,620
the Orange Lawns radio book of course you know we've got a little bit of time

2223
02:47:59,620 --> 02:48:02,780
left and what do we always do when we have a little time left at the end of

2224
02:48:02,780 --> 02:48:06,780
Let's ask Orange Lounge a question.

2225
02:48:06,780 --> 02:48:12,780
Can I ask you a question?

2226
02:48:12,780 --> 02:48:15,780
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

2227
02:48:15,780 --> 02:48:19,780
What will we find out tonight on Orange Lounge Radio?

2228
02:48:19,780 --> 02:48:22,780
Will they ask about the studio since last week we are here?

2229
02:48:22,780 --> 02:48:26,780
Or will they ask a question about the new place where we're gonna be?

2230
02:48:26,780 --> 02:48:28,780
Or will they ask something else?

2231
02:48:28,780 --> 02:48:32,780
WICKY WICKY!

2232
02:48:32,780 --> 02:48:36,780
Excuse me, I want to ask you a few questions.

2233
02:48:36,780 --> 02:48:43,780
Um, Elle Mullet, assuming Orange Lounge, the band,

2234
02:48:43,780 --> 02:48:47,780
ever sued you and made you change your name,

2235
02:48:47,780 --> 02:48:50,780
what would you call your station in its place?

2236
02:48:50,780 --> 02:48:53,780
Uh, research that they can't sue us, ha ha ha,

2237
02:48:53,780 --> 02:48:56,780
because it's not registered in the United States.

2238
02:48:56,780 --> 02:49:00,640
it'll never happen he says yes it'll never happen but what if we'd have to

2239
02:49:00,640 --> 02:49:07,640
name our lounge radio I say we name ourselves the big comfy couch radio

2240
02:49:07,640 --> 02:49:14,360
station uh bananas in pajamas now nobody better steal this or I swear to God I'm

2241
02:49:14,360 --> 02:49:17,020
gonna kick your ass but the standby title I had always thought of was game

2242
02:49:17,020 --> 02:49:21,920
beat was the name so cuz you know beat mania I was thinking after the store

2243
02:49:21,920 --> 02:49:26,060
that Dan owned game on that would be a good one too we haven't really ever sat

2244
02:49:26,060 --> 02:49:30,000
down talked about this but Jamie Jamie's gonna kick your ass Jamie research the

2245
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:33,680
trademark and since orange lounge actually is a trademark in the u.s. we

2246
02:49:33,680 --> 02:49:38,180
can have it but Konami Konami knows what we're doing and they don't care we'll do

2247
02:49:38,180 --> 02:49:42,680
what Kentucky Fried Chicken does and just call ourselves OLR that's possible as

2248
02:49:42,680 --> 02:49:51,600
well so alright anyway let's see they're giving us all these Spanish names in

2249
02:49:51,600 --> 02:49:52,920
I don't know what that is about.

2250
02:49:52,920 --> 02:49:54,160
El Pantelon!

2251
02:49:54,160 --> 02:49:55,720
Uh, Fireboma says,

2252
02:49:55,720 --> 02:49:58,920
How many licks does it take to get to the center of Loki's pants?

2253
02:49:58,920 --> 02:50:03,120
Well, hey, uh,

2254
02:50:03,120 --> 02:50:06,520
you know, when there's only, when there's a giant gaping hole in them,

2255
02:50:06,520 --> 02:50:11,400
one. That's not the question you need to be asking us. Yeah, honestly,

2256
02:50:11,400 --> 02:50:15,360
uh, we'll, we will give you his girlfriend's email address and you can just ask her

2257
02:50:15,360 --> 02:50:15,880
directly.

2258
02:50:15,880 --> 02:50:20,120
Why you want to know this, I don't know.

2259
02:50:20,120 --> 02:50:27,140
DJ Morpheus is suggesting, by the way, hi, The Peach Colored Booby Show, to which Dark

2260
02:50:27,140 --> 02:50:29,260
Sakura is politely looking away.

2261
02:50:29,260 --> 02:50:34,180
My response was dot, dot, dot in the chatroom.

2262
02:50:34,180 --> 02:50:37,900
By the way, big thank you to DJ Morpheus for being funny.

2263
02:50:37,900 --> 02:50:42,060
And check out his program, Undersedation Live, over on Live 365.

2264
02:50:42,060 --> 02:50:43,940
It's actually linked right from our play page.

2265
02:50:43,940 --> 02:50:44,940
It's on the bottom.

2266
02:50:44,940 --> 02:50:45,940
So check it out.

2267
02:50:45,940 --> 02:50:46,940
USL.

2268
02:50:46,940 --> 02:50:48,560
730 Pacific Daylight Time.

2269
02:50:48,560 --> 02:50:49,560
On Saturday.

2270
02:50:49,560 --> 02:50:56,560
Indeed. See? Travis, you can't bullshit me anymore. I just, uh, yeah. I just gave you a shout-out, so there, bye.

2271
02:50:57,560 --> 02:51:06,560
Alright. Uh, LXL Doobs. Why does everyone hate Stoics, Safari, etc. after the new 2DX?

2272
02:51:06,560 --> 02:51:08,560
I don't hate Stoics, it's Taku.

2273
02:51:08,560 --> 02:51:11,560
I'm sorry, I don't really follow 2DX.

2274
02:51:11,560 --> 02:51:14,560
The Safari was never meant to be 150 BPM, that's why.

2275
02:51:14,560 --> 02:51:18,960
That is actually a big reason why people have a beef with the Safari and the song Get On Beat.

2276
02:51:18,960 --> 02:51:25,760
When they originally appeared in 3rd and 4th style respectively, they were about 40, about 130-ish.

2277
02:51:25,760 --> 02:51:30,160
I've come close to actually beating them, and now I can't and never will.

2278
02:51:30,160 --> 02:51:36,480
For some reason, and we have no idea why, but when 6th style came out, they sped them up to 160 BPM,

2279
02:51:36,480 --> 02:51:40,960
which makes, and speeding up a song makes it harder in 2DX. You have to hit more keys in a minute,

2280
02:51:40,960 --> 02:51:45,040
it just automatically makes the song harder. In fact, there was an another I was playing

2281
02:51:45,040 --> 02:51:50,440
in 9th style the other day. The another is just the same damn song sped up. It's crazy.

2282
02:51:50,440 --> 02:51:53,560
I can't even remember what it was, though. I think it's Distress, I want to say. I think

2283
02:51:53,560 --> 02:51:57,660
it's Distress Another. It's just sped up. I know that there was one, I don't remember

2284
02:51:57,660 --> 02:52:03,040
what it was that had, uh, freezes in it, or where it stopped, but in the another it, it

2285
02:52:03,040 --> 02:52:06,840
like speeds up or something. I don't remember what song it was. I think it was on 4th style.

2286
02:52:06,840 --> 02:52:11,120
although i don't think that it'll be no it wasn't going to know i don't have a

2287
02:52:11,120 --> 02:52:13,320
good enough

2288
02:52:13,320 --> 02:52:16,800
you know i was faster on uh... they did it both ways

2289
02:52:16,800 --> 02:52:19,280
and it was uh...

2290
02:52:19,280 --> 02:52:21,120
radical faith

2291
02:52:21,120 --> 02:52:23,180
now was not a complete it was uh...

2292
02:52:23,180 --> 02:52:26,160
that that was one of the talk is on

2293
02:52:26,160 --> 02:52:29,480
and if you have a suggestion or chair of he says that they hate them because the

2294
02:52:29,480 --> 02:52:33,000
note charts are total bullshit

2295
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:36,360
and how i think i actually like the safari

2296
02:52:36,360 --> 02:52:40,200
the song. Oh yeah, the songs are great. I mean, 2DX songs are sexy. Well, Get On Beat

2297
02:52:40,200 --> 02:52:45,540
Wild Style makes me want to barf up, but... Although, sadly, I think like 5th, 6th, 7th

2298
02:52:45,540 --> 02:52:49,360
for me was about the peak of 2DX music. I haven't been so into new ones. I think there's

2299
02:52:49,360 --> 02:52:54,420
good stuff, though, in the later ones, but... I miss the 4th style booty dancers. We need

2300
02:52:54,420 --> 02:52:59,360
more 4th style booty dancers. We need the chick in the bandana to come back and we need

2301
02:52:59,360 --> 02:53:05,200
that weird looking guy. LXL Doobs also is asking, why didn't anybody have sex with the

2302
02:53:05,200 --> 02:53:10,360
blow-up lamb that Jonas brought tonight because islanders going for it islanders

2303
02:53:10,360 --> 02:53:15,600
going for it because some of us don't need to fake it some of us get it for

2304
02:53:15,600 --> 02:53:23,800
real oh you can quote her on that well Islanders leaving officially violated

2305
02:53:23,800 --> 02:53:24,800
Wow.

2306
02:53:24,800 --> 02:53:25,800
Alright.

2307
02:53:25,800 --> 02:53:41,040
Didi Archaholic says she wants to ask us if our favorite soda is still pineapple.

2308
02:53:41,040 --> 02:53:44,840
I think she's asking me specifically, is your favorite soda still pineapple?

2309
02:53:44,840 --> 02:53:47,380
Pineapple Crush specifically is my favorite soda.

2310
02:53:47,380 --> 02:53:50,080
I am warming up to other brands because I don't make Pineapple Crush anymore.

2311
02:53:50,080 --> 02:53:52,300
I'm warming up to other brands of pineapple soda.

2312
02:53:52,300 --> 02:53:53,300
But I find I...

2313
02:53:53,300 --> 02:53:55,300
by Pineapple Crush in the ghetto.

2314
02:53:55,300 --> 02:53:57,300
Well, I gotta go...

2315
02:53:57,300 --> 02:53:59,300
Go down to Del Paso.

2316
02:53:59,300 --> 02:54:01,300
I need to go, because I miss Pineapple Crush.

2317
02:54:01,300 --> 02:54:03,300
It was the best. I do still like Pineapple Crush.

2318
02:54:03,300 --> 02:54:05,300
She says her favorite is melon soda.

2319
02:54:05,300 --> 02:54:07,300
I am developing a fond

2320
02:54:07,300 --> 02:54:09,300
likeness for chocolate soda, though.

2321
02:54:09,300 --> 02:54:11,300
Ramené.

2322
02:54:11,300 --> 02:54:13,300
Because it explodes. I love watching people who've

2323
02:54:13,300 --> 02:54:15,300
never drunk ramené before, and watching

2324
02:54:15,300 --> 02:54:17,300
it explode all over them.

2325
02:54:17,300 --> 02:54:19,300
Pineapple is the one way you can get

2326
02:54:19,300 --> 02:54:21,300
me to break my rule of only diet sodas.

2327
02:54:21,300 --> 02:54:24,620
For those who don't know, I actually gave up regular sodas in favor of diet sodas and

2328
02:54:24,620 --> 02:54:25,620
really water.

2329
02:54:25,620 --> 02:54:28,620
I drink water more than anything else.

2330
02:54:28,620 --> 02:54:31,620
About two years ago now, it's been a while, damn, it's really been that long, it was about

2331
02:54:31,620 --> 02:54:33,620
two years ago I gave up soda.

2332
02:54:33,620 --> 02:54:36,140
So pineapple's the only thing that would get me to drink regular soda, otherwise I stick

2333
02:54:36,140 --> 02:54:37,900
with pretty much diets.

2334
02:54:37,900 --> 02:54:40,900
Diet cream soda is the best though, because it tastes like regular cream soda, it really

2335
02:54:40,900 --> 02:54:41,900
does.

2336
02:54:41,900 --> 02:54:43,100
You know what I should do one day?

2337
02:54:43,100 --> 02:54:49,420
Get some pineapple sugar-free Torani, and some half and half, and some soda water, and

2338
02:54:49,420 --> 02:54:50,980
make pineapple Italian cream sodas.

2339
02:54:50,980 --> 02:54:55,420
would love you I would love you okay we got oh we only got a little bit of show

2340
02:54:55,420 --> 02:54:58,620

2341
02:54:58,620 --> 02:55:03,280

you heard episode 69 though eventually I heard I'm staying in yeah I mean that

2355
02:56:03,720 --> 02:56:06,880
was that whole karaoke revolution I mean it was episode 69 what what do you

2356
02:56:06,880 --> 02:56:11,520
expect I think it was in San Diego staying in the gay fry house you were

2357
02:56:11,520 --> 02:56:15,800
you were we're not gonna have that much fun on the Harry Potter closet the next

2358
02:56:15,800 --> 02:56:25,800
The first time we will have that much fun on a show will be either episode 187 or episode 420, if we make it that far.

2359
02:56:25,800 --> 02:56:32,800
You know we will. We are here to stay because my ego will not let us quit.

2360
02:56:32,800 --> 02:56:43,800
You know, I don't, I think that I have fun every week, so every week is a shining star in my memory.

2361
02:56:43,800 --> 02:56:48,480
fire bomb asked a follow-up question do do I like dr. pepper cherry vanilla

2362

02:56:55,600 --> 02:57:01,120
pepper it sounds great dr. pepper awesome cherry soda awesome vanilla

2364
02:57:01,120 --> 02:57:05,800

2365
02:57:05,800 --> 02:57:09,360
there because it wasn't out here yet and I was like okay I'll try something new I

2366
02:57:09,360 --> 02:57:16,000
I drank probably an ounce of my 20 ounce bottle and threw it away.

2367
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:18,960
I didn't even pour it out because the poor plants would have died.

2368
02:57:18,960 --> 02:57:25,680
Legend of Zaku wants to know, will the ferrets have their own bar and love making pad in the new place?

2369
02:57:25,680 --> 02:57:28,640
Um, no.

2370
02:57:28,640 --> 02:57:32,040
We'll try to think of something special for the ferrets, but we don't have any plans yet.

2371
02:57:32,040 --> 02:57:35,360
I guess that's the best answer I have for that, sorry.

2372
02:57:35,360 --> 02:57:43,880
you know my I'm so disappointed that my evil gateway the hell machine so broken

2373
02:57:43,880 --> 02:57:55,120
right now so the hell are you doing all right and dark night last question last

2374
02:57:55,120 --> 02:57:59,560
the last ask orange launch question in the studio I keep feeling like we're

2375
02:57:59,560 --> 02:58:03,760
having like a final episode of the whole thing but really not we are coming back

2376

2377
02:58:09,100 --> 02:58:13,480
is going to dark night and dark night wants to know sky can you take the web

2378
02:58:13,480 --> 02:58:19,400
cam and show the studio one more time before the show ends I took pictures

2379
02:58:19,400 --> 02:58:25,280

2380
02:58:25,280 --> 02:58:29,360
but I will put it up there or I will send it to somebody if they'll put it up

2381
02:58:29,360 --> 02:58:33,400

i think if you could take pictures to get a camera that will put on our

2390
02:59:06,720 --> 02:59:08,760
website now to create

2391
02:59:08,760 --> 02:59:10,040

2392
02:59:10,040 --> 02:59:12,880
and none of me because i've never

2393
02:59:12,880 --> 02:59:16,240
okay i'm going to take one picture after the show book

2394
02:59:16,240 --> 02:59:17,560
this is a completely dirty

2395
02:59:17,560 --> 02:59:20,640
well that we ought to cram into the kitchen

2396
02:59:20,640 --> 02:59:23,560
i will be in the pictures because i'm not supposed to be

2397
02:59:23,560 --> 02:59:27,720

2398
02:59:27,720 --> 02:59:29,000
okay anyway on

2399
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:30,240
so that's it

2400
02:59:30,240 --> 02:59:31,360
and thus

2401
02:59:31,360 --> 02:59:38,440
is the end of episode 139, when we come back, season 6, episode 140.

2402
02:59:38,440 --> 02:59:39,920
We are starting over.

2403
02:59:39,920 --> 02:59:42,760
New studio, new sound for the station.

2404
02:59:42,760 --> 02:59:44,960
Orange launch radio, what gamers really want.

2405
02:59:44,960 --> 02:59:49,320
Should I be disturbed that Jonas can put his entire fist in his mouth?

2406
02:59:49,320 --> 02:59:51,180
I don't know.

2407
02:59:51,180 --> 02:59:56,240
Once again, to end the show on a sappy note, thank you guys to the listeners.

2408
02:59:56,240 --> 02:59:57,820
We do this because of you guys.

2409
02:59:57,820 --> 02:59:59,760
You guys rock, honestly.

2410
02:59:59,760 --> 03:00:03,040
Some of you guys have been supporting the station since episode one.

2411
03:00:03,040 --> 03:00:06,520
Some of you guys, I know like, just there's folks that have been listening since episode

2412
03:00:06,520 --> 03:00:07,520
one.

2413
03:00:07,520 --> 03:00:08,520
Some of you guys haven't been listening.

2414
03:00:08,520 --> 03:00:11,720
A lot of guys didn't come on board until, remember when we had the Urain premiere?

2415
03:00:11,720 --> 03:00:13,480
We got a lot of new people that night.

2416
03:00:13,480 --> 03:00:14,480
That was very awesome.

2417
03:00:14,480 --> 03:00:18,400
So thanks again to Mel B for helping hook us up with that.

2418
03:00:18,400 --> 03:00:19,400
And-

2419
03:00:19,400 --> 03:00:20,400
You totally pimped, all right.

2420
03:00:20,400 --> 03:00:21,400
Miklotov.

2421
03:00:21,400 --> 03:00:26,100
Miklotov as well, because that really expanded our fan base.

2422
03:00:26,100 --> 03:00:30,100
A big thank you to DDR Freak Radio, who we've been doing more work with in the past year,

2423
03:00:30,100 --> 03:00:35,100
showing that two stations with similar interests can work together for the common good.

2424
03:00:35,100 --> 03:00:42,100
And also a big thank you to under sedation live, for which none of this, if under sedation live did not exist,

2425
03:00:42,100 --> 03:00:44,100
probably none of this would exist either.

2426
03:00:44,100 --> 03:00:45,100
We love you.

2427
03:00:45,100 --> 03:00:48,100
So, anything else?

2428
03:00:48,100 --> 03:00:51,100
Since we're not going to get to do an acceptance speech at the best of awards, probably.

2429
03:00:51,100 --> 03:00:53,100
This one is bullshit!

2430
03:00:53,100 --> 03:01:03,420
going yourself just go with yourself we will be here next week with a show it

2431
03:01:03,420 --> 03:01:07,100
just be a tape show but it'll be kind of a bookend show just be something to tie

2432
03:01:07,100 --> 03:01:12,300
this week together in two weeks May 1st Orange launch radio version 2.0 what

2433
03:01:12,300 --> 03:01:19,340
gamers really want to know and now final thoughts and they'll be you've got the

2434
03:01:19,340 --> 03:01:22,280
mike to get started properly

2435
03:01:22,280 --> 03:01:23,720
uh... well

2436
03:01:23,720 --> 03:01:26,880
uh... i just hope that in this next place that we have uh...

2437
03:01:26,880 --> 03:01:28,800
watch you have some furniture set up

2438
03:01:28,800 --> 03:01:32,640
you know what that is the next two years actually smaller

2439
03:01:32,640 --> 03:01:36,520
just for like computers in orange lounge so that's kind of a trade-off

2440
03:01:36,520 --> 03:01:40,720
but you know it was a lot more fun at the old house where we all had to be on

2441
03:01:40,720 --> 03:01:43,200
top of it's going to be that again it's going to be that again

2442
03:01:43,200 --> 03:01:45,960
okay just for that you got a like mountain twister map on the back of the

2443
03:01:45,960 --> 03:01:49,500
with but with that better ventilation

2444
03:01:49,500 --> 03:01:52,660
and there's a window right there it's gonna be nice

2445
03:01:52,660 --> 03:01:56,380
but yeah for uh... going five seasons try guys say man this is a pretty cool

2446
03:01:56,380 --> 03:01:57,580
setup and

2447
03:01:57,580 --> 03:02:01,020
i mean on behalf of the year spot one you know give you uh... lots of props

2448
03:02:01,020 --> 03:02:02,660
for keeping this thing going

2449
03:02:02,660 --> 03:02:05,640
army you probably do a hell of a lot better than we do on the upkeep but hey

2450
03:02:05,640 --> 03:02:07,980
anything we can do like they say on

2451
03:02:07,980 --> 03:02:12,100
as far as from spot standpoint if uh... we can't win the race will help the

2452
03:02:12,100 --> 03:02:14,140
people in front of us break the record

2453
03:02:14,140 --> 03:02:21,140
Thank you, buddy. I appreciate that. Thank you. Thank you. That's so sweet. And, you know, Mel has not only done a lot for the station, but he's also helped me out a lot, personally, as well.

He did our first promo. He did. He was our first celebrity promo. And we've been running that promo ever since.

2455
03:02:28,140 --> 03:02:33,140
He's our first celebrity promo. Yeah. Sharks Girl, final thought.

2456
03:02:33,140 --> 03:02:43,140
Well, it's been fun in here. And when I heard you guys were doing the last show in the studio and I had nothing to do, I was like, I have to go up there just to harass them. I'm not going to tell anybody I'm showing up.

2457
03:02:43,140 --> 03:02:48,780

Islander, behind you.

2471
03:03:45,040 --> 03:03:46,040
Final thoughts?

2472
03:03:46,040 --> 03:03:50,720
Yeah, it was fun here, the few times that I've been here, and I'm really looking forward

2473
03:03:50,720 --> 03:03:57,800
to doing this again, being here, hanging out, and checking out the new place when it's ready.

2474
03:03:57,800 --> 03:03:58,800
All right.

2475
03:03:58,800 --> 03:03:59,800
Angel.

2476
03:03:59,800 --> 03:04:05,200
Although I haven't been listening since episode one, I have been listening since episode 26.

2477
03:04:05,200 --> 03:04:06,840
Been good times since then.

2478
03:04:06,840 --> 03:04:10,960
good times at this place and hope to continue it when we get to the new

2479
03:04:10,960 --> 03:04:16,360
studio uh... good times come here we go

2480
03:04:16,360 --> 03:04:21,200
i'll be honest this is a big hole okay the whole apartment is falling apart

2481
03:04:21,200 --> 03:04:23,080
i mean there's mold in my room

2482
03:04:23,080 --> 03:04:28,120
and the windows falling off the peephole god damn shot out at me today

2483
03:04:28,120 --> 03:04:30,160
well no not today but the other day

2484
03:04:30,160 --> 03:04:33,720
there's a rat rotting out in front of our apartment i forgot to mention that

2485
03:04:33,720 --> 03:04:35,960
eww i saw the rat

2486
03:04:35,960 --> 03:04:43,220
It's a goddamn hole, but the other place will be a lot better. So, you know, whatever what you make do with what we have and

2487
03:04:44,340 --> 03:04:50,860
Yeah, I gotta still pack some more and I have my laundry going that's never going to be dry in time by the time Nellie

2488
03:04:50,860 --> 03:04:52,860
picks me up and oh

2489
03:04:53,220 --> 03:04:55,220
Damn it. I hate this week

2490
03:04:55,220 --> 03:05:01,740
Dark Sakura. Oh, you want me to go? They have a request to hear the grudge sound real fast.

2491
03:05:01,740 --> 03:05:09,300
Thank you. You know, I'm going to have to show this to you. In the new place, in my

2492
03:05:09,300 --> 03:05:14,220
new roommates, who by the way, has never been on this show and has no idea what to expect,

2493
03:05:14,220 --> 03:05:18,940
my new roommate. He's a gamer, though. He likes Donkey Konga. He loves that game. So

2494
03:05:18,940 --> 03:05:23,060
we'll see what happens. My new roommate, in his bedroom, he has the master bedroom in

2495
03:05:23,060 --> 03:05:28,500
In his bedroom, there's actually a little cutout that goes to the attic type thing,

2496
03:05:28,500 --> 03:05:29,500
and I did that the other night.

2497
03:05:29,500 --> 03:05:32,820
I started going, uh, and now he says he can't sleep.

2498
03:05:32,820 --> 03:05:39,180
You know, one of Dan's assistant managers at GameStop said that that sound is made by

2499
03:05:39,180 --> 03:05:43,660
the vocal cords that control your high pitch and your low pitch, that if you can make that

2500
03:05:43,660 --> 03:05:46,020
noise, it means you have a very good vocal capacity.

2501
03:05:46,020 --> 03:05:49,340
So, like, gotta get me to sing karaoke.

2502
03:05:49,340 --> 03:05:50,340
All right.

2503
03:05:50,340 --> 03:05:53,940
final thought is again guys I know this is sounding like a last show but it is

2504
03:05:53,940 --> 03:06:01,780
not over we are starting over I'm gonna go with what I've been going with lately

2505
03:06:01,780 --> 03:06:06,500
reject false icons think for yourself decide what you like all right

2506
03:06:06,500 --> 03:06:15,660
Islander angels fly because they take themselves lightly all right all right

2507
03:06:15,660 --> 03:06:20,580
Alright guys, we're well over time tonight, thank you listeners, thank you, thank you,
