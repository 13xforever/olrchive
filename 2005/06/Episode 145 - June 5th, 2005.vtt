05:41.220 --> 05:43.420
Suicide girls suck!

05:43.420 --> 05:45.980
OMG, I want to kill myself.

05:45.980 --> 05:46.980
Watch me slip.

05:46.980 --> 05:47.980
Who's got a razor?

05:47.980 --> 05:52.540
I'm so emo, watch me slit my wrists and bleed my angst all over the world.

05:52.540 --> 05:56.580
Does anyone actually self-declare themselves as emo?

05:56.580 --> 05:57.600
Like, I hear a lot of-

05:57.600 --> 06:02.780
No, cause that's not cool. I thought emo was like the hip thing to do right now, you know.

06:02.780 --> 06:08.080
But I don't get it because everybody makes fun of emo people. I don't know anybody that's standing up for emo rights.

06:08.080 --> 06:11.080
You know, I don't know anyone that's like saying, you know, I'm emo.

06:11.080 --> 06:14.920
Yeah, but see, the things that you make fun of now are hip, like, next year.

06:14.920 --> 06:19.920
So are you saying that, like, VH1 will do the I love the emo next year?

06:19.920 --> 06:22.200
Yeah.

06:22.200 --> 06:29.200
Remember kids, down the block, not across the street.

06:29.200 --> 06:31.280
Wow, think about that one for a minute.

06:31.280 --> 06:33.320
Alright, also joining us,

06:33.320 --> 06:34.780
Tech Masa, Loki!

06:34.780 --> 06:38.720
I love Pizza Hut.

06:38.720 --> 06:43.620
It's becoming a tradition for you to come over and bring Pizza Hut every Sunday.

06:43.620 --> 06:48.220
I could, well, twice is enough.

06:48.220 --> 06:51.800
I could swear like every week you've been in this new studio you've brought over Pizza Hut.

06:51.800 --> 06:53.320
I've only done twice!

06:53.320 --> 06:58.180
The new studio, by the way, is right across the freeway from a Pizza Hut, Pizza Slut slash

06:58.180 --> 06:59.180
Taco Bell place.

06:59.180 --> 07:03.520
Yeah, it's more like Taco Bell with some pizza.

07:03.520 --> 07:05.880
Yeah, it really is what it is.

07:05.880 --> 07:08.880
Anyway, also joining us tonight, we have a very special guest.

07:08.880 --> 07:14.760
We haven't had many guests in the new studio, so we're very pleased to welcome a staff member

07:14.760 --> 07:17.800
of DDRFreak.com, say hello to Islander!

07:17.800 --> 07:18.800
Hello!

07:18.800 --> 07:22.800
One of the original DDRfreak.com members, if I'm not mistaken.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.800
Yeah, can you believe that? I'm over five years.

07:24.800 --> 07:25.800
Shit, that's a long time!

07:25.800 --> 07:26.800
I know, it's a very long time.

07:26.800 --> 07:35.800
Oh, you know, before I forget, I need to give a shout-out to, ohmygoditsdoobs, because when I first saw that name, I thought it was, ohmygoditsboobs.

07:35.800 --> 07:40.800
I want to know if that person stole the name from my live journal.

07:40.800 --> 07:42.800
And so I was just like, wow.

07:42.800 --> 07:48.800
And then I think somebody else changed her name to oh my god it's noobs, which I thought was kind of funny, too.

07:48.800 --> 07:53.800
Oh my god it's something that rhymes with oobs tonight.

07:53.800 --> 07:55.800
I have to say one more thing tonight, though.

07:55.800 --> 07:56.800
Okay, what's that?

07:56.800 --> 07:58.800
Happy birthday to Murdock!

07:58.800 --> 08:00.800
Cause he's 39 and ancient.

08:00.800 --> 08:05.800
But that's, in US time, that's actually tomorrow, right? 6-6 of 66?

08:05.800 --> 08:08.800
It's June 6th in the UK, so happy birthday.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.800
Um, isn't he a fictional character?

08:10.800 --> 08:13.800
I can still say happy birthday.

08:13.800 --> 08:16.800
Okie doke.

08:16.800 --> 08:19.800
If Mickey Mouse could have a birthday.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.800
Alright.

08:22.800 --> 08:26.800
Alright, we'll be back after this with more Happy Skippy Orange Launch Radio.

08:26.800 --> 08:30.800
If you want to join our chat room and, you know, hang out with OMG,

08:30.800 --> 08:34.800
it's doobs and boobs and noobs and scoobs and whatever else they come up with.

08:34.800 --> 08:38.800
Head on over to our website, www.orangelaunchradio.com

08:38.800 --> 08:45.240
and click on chat. In this break, we're going to hear some music from Popin' Music Iroha,

08:45.240 --> 08:50.400
also known as Popin' Music 12, because somebody wanted me to play this song last week and

08:50.400 --> 08:53.000
I never got to it. I think it was Siggy or something. I don't even know if he's listening

08:53.000 --> 08:57.840
right now, but I can't say I didn't honor that request. So, what are you giggling at

08:57.840 --> 09:04.840
over there? You're giggling like a little girl. You actually found an animated graphic.

09:04.840 --> 09:09.040
Oh somebody posted in the chat room somebody posted at the chat room that's

09:09.040 --> 09:12.800
brilliant somebody posted a picture for those of you that aren't in a chair

09:12.800 --> 09:17.420
somebody actually posted a picture of a hand showing the razor and it says

09:17.420 --> 09:22.920
remember kids what is that a down the street down the road make it count down

09:22.920 --> 09:26.920
the road not across the street I'm gonna have to find Sherlock's icon that's

09:26.920 --> 09:30.880
beautiful all right we'll be back after this pop of music

09:30.880 --> 09:32.880
Orange launch radio

10:30.880 --> 10:32.880
Oh

13:00.880 --> 13:02.380
It blows in.

13:02.440 --> 13:04.360
You can't take that seriously

13:04.860 --> 13:06.000
It blows in,

13:06.300 --> 13:07.240
It blows in,

13:07.760 --> 13:09.780
You can't take that seriously

13:10.280 --> 13:11.360
It blows in,

13:11.660 --> 13:12.740
It blows in,

13:13.000 --> 13:15.120
You can't take that seriously

13:15.640 --> 13:16.900
It blows in,

13:17.020 --> 13:18.100
It blows in,

13:48.100 --> 13:55.100
1, 2, 3, 4!

14:18.100 --> 14:20.100
One, two, three, four!

15:18.100 --> 15:20.100
you

16:48.100 --> 16:53.100
I look at you and say you're a bad boy

17:18.100 --> 17:25.100
the

17:30.220 --> 17:32.260
orange lounge radio

17:32.260 --> 17:33.740
amani music

17:33.740 --> 17:35.340
and more

17:35.340 --> 17:38.300
we are back here on orange lounge

17:38.300 --> 17:43.380
hi, whoops sorry, getting into a little third mix korean if i'm not careful there

17:43.380 --> 17:45.240
we're back here on orange lounge radio

17:45.240 --> 17:47.900
and that break uh... shizuku

17:47.900 --> 17:50.660
uh... the new star mine remix

17:50.660 --> 17:54.860
uh... the new kiriyama mocha song that was so key hyper rock and uh...

17:54.860 --> 17:56.880
uh... viral kana all from

17:56.880 --> 17:58.460
pop music you know how

17:58.460 --> 18:01.640
or if you're lazy like me to say papa music twelve the technically it's

18:01.640 --> 18:03.280
papa music you know

18:03.280 --> 18:06.480
which some of us got to play we're at e three couple weeks ago and actually went

18:06.480 --> 18:07.440
to a high

18:07.440 --> 18:10.240
you got you check that out right i know i played and i got

18:10.240 --> 18:15.440
i got screwed up because when you go into the game it's not like the old pop

18:15.440 --> 18:20.120
Pop'n Musics, where you have the full song list and you can pick whatever you want, it

18:20.120 --> 18:24.120
kind of starts you off in this dumbed-down mode, I think, more for kids.

18:24.120 --> 18:28.080
Yeah, and you can't choose your speed modifiers and all this bullshit, so I got stuck in that

18:28.080 --> 18:29.080
first.

18:29.080 --> 18:30.080
Yeah, me too.

18:30.080 --> 18:34.120
But I played all the Ani-Me music, and all the... and, uh, Goonies.

18:34.120 --> 18:35.120
Yeah, that's cool.

18:35.120 --> 18:37.120
Well, the Goonies was in Pop'n Musics 10, but...

18:37.120 --> 18:38.120
I went ahead and played the drum line.

18:38.120 --> 18:39.120
Did you?

18:39.120 --> 18:40.120
I thought you hated that remix.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.120
I do hate it, but I had to play it.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.120
Oh, okay.

18:42.120 --> 18:43.120
It was actually pretty fun and easy.

18:43.120 --> 18:45.120
It was actually pretty fun and easy.

19:13.120 --> 19:16.520
is a little scary to I think a lot of people

19:16.520 --> 19:20.240
but I don't know to me it's cute I like it

19:20.240 --> 19:23.960
I think more people should be into it. Hi

19:23.960 --> 19:26.960
we're here on Orange Laundry to episode number 145

19:26.960 --> 19:30.080
somebody in chat told me I said 140 in the opening

19:30.080 --> 19:33.400
oops my bad it's actually 145 tonight. I thought I said

19:33.400 --> 19:36.160
145 but somebody said I said 140.

19:36.160 --> 19:41.180
145 tonight that means we're very close to 150 isn't that scary?

19:41.180 --> 19:47.320
You know what else is this month? The three-year anniversary of this show.

19:47.320 --> 19:51.600
Three years! Come along, let's have that Bart ride, huh?

19:51.600 --> 19:55.020
Seriously, and this show is now old enough to attend preschool.

19:55.020 --> 19:58.100
Yes. You know,

19:58.100 --> 20:02.480
when I was three I had a good vocabulary. And I think that our vocabulary has

20:02.480 --> 20:03.640
grown quite a bit from

20:03.640 --> 20:06.960
shit-fuck-damn, you know.

20:06.960 --> 20:11.060
Oh, I bet I still like my dick and fart jokes.

20:11.060 --> 20:15.060
I still hate burping on the microphone.

20:15.060 --> 20:19.060
It guarantees that the microphone stays in my possession.

20:19.060 --> 20:23.060
And I don't think anybody that was listening to us episode 1

20:23.060 --> 20:27.060
still listens, which is kind of sad.

20:27.060 --> 20:31.060
Wasn't Dark Tetsuya there for episode 1? I think that's about it.

20:31.060 --> 20:35.060
Wasn't he in the room for episode 1?

20:35.060 --> 20:39.060
Yeah, Puppy needs to actually do his correspondent job.

20:39.060 --> 20:41.060
So we do have a few people.

20:41.060 --> 20:43.060
We have some of our old schoolers.

20:43.060 --> 20:50.060
So we'll be having our three year anniversary special thingy sometime this month.

20:50.060 --> 20:54.060
Don't know when yet because I could be out of town one of the weeks this month so we'll see.

20:54.060 --> 20:55.060
Well that's poopy.

20:55.060 --> 21:01.060
Yeah I'm going to be going to LA this month and then actually in August I'm going to be going to the East Coast.

21:01.060 --> 21:04.060
I actually have two trips to the East Coast plan right now which is really weird.

21:04.060 --> 21:06.060
One for work and one for leisure.

21:06.060 --> 21:09.660
One for work and one for leisure, because I planned the leisure one already.

21:09.660 --> 21:14.700
I was going to go to the New York area around Labor Day, and now I'm going to be going to

21:14.700 --> 21:17.740
Pennsylvania in August.

21:17.740 --> 21:18.740
So that's kind of interesting.

21:18.740 --> 21:19.740
I'm sorry.

21:19.740 --> 21:22.420
Well, I heard about, you know, it's kind of empty.

21:22.420 --> 21:25.540
There's not a whole lot there, but I heard about some, like, classic gaming store out

21:25.540 --> 21:26.540
there.

21:26.540 --> 21:29.500
Somebody had sent me a tip over email, so I'm really curious to check that out.

21:29.500 --> 21:35.300
I just hope it doesn't suck, like, a certain classic video game store we have here in town.

21:35.300 --> 21:37.340
Have you ever been there?

21:37.340 --> 21:40.980
They're dead and they became Dan's store so I really wouldn't say anything about that

21:40.980 --> 21:41.980
please.

21:41.980 --> 21:42.980
Really?

21:42.980 --> 21:43.980
Yes.

21:43.980 --> 21:44.980
No, no, no.

21:44.980 --> 21:47.180
There's still one that has that name.

21:47.180 --> 21:48.300
It's gone.

21:48.300 --> 21:49.300
All of them are gone.

21:49.300 --> 21:50.300
They went out of business.

21:50.300 --> 21:52.300
If it's anything, it's Leah's ex-husband.

21:52.300 --> 21:53.300
Wow.

21:53.300 --> 21:54.300
No.

21:54.300 --> 21:58.300
I will give a short history on that one.

21:58.300 --> 22:03.740
Leah, who was the ex-wife partner, went into business with Dan to keep the store alive

22:03.740 --> 22:10.740
And so it became game on, and then she kind of screwed him out because she went to Pocket Lenny because she was dating a rich guy.

22:10.740 --> 22:11.740
Uh-huh.

22:11.740 --> 22:12.740
So, yeah.

22:12.740 --> 22:15.740
But that, it's not the same one I'm thinking of, though.

22:15.740 --> 22:20.740
It's because the one I, I went there like six months ago and it was still that old thing.

22:20.740 --> 22:21.740
Same old logo and everything?

22:21.740 --> 22:22.740
Yeah, same old logo and everything.

22:22.740 --> 22:23.740
That's funny.

22:23.740 --> 22:24.740
I'll have to point out where that is.

22:24.740 --> 22:25.740
That's funny.

22:25.740 --> 22:26.740
They're, they're not that hot, though.

22:26.740 --> 22:27.740
I'm sorry.

22:27.740 --> 22:28.740
Well, they weren't hot to begin with.

22:28.740 --> 22:29.740
All right.

22:29.740 --> 22:30.740
Anyway, sorry.

22:30.740 --> 22:31.740
Hi, inside jokes.

22:31.740 --> 22:37.300
Let's start off tonight's show with a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day?

22:37.300 --> 22:39.820
Where we find out how your week was, as well as your day.

22:39.820 --> 22:40.820
Start, Sakura.

22:40.820 --> 22:47.260
My week was work, and of course having my day off, like all of us who work for a bank

22:47.260 --> 22:48.260
did.

22:48.260 --> 22:53.460
And I really didn't do a whole bunch of anything.

22:53.460 --> 22:55.660
Played some PSO, of course.

22:55.660 --> 23:00.420
Played some Silent Hill, didn't get too far, so I'm actually at the same save point I was

23:00.420 --> 23:09.500
that before. Um, played a lot of Puyo Puyo. Watched Dan beat Fire Emblem. Excuse me. Um,

23:09.500 --> 23:13.340
tried to draw and really couldn't and then I started writing on, um, one of my fanfics

23:13.340 --> 23:17.780
and it was just kind of a dull week. Oh yeah, I still haven't gotten the money for my car,

23:17.780 --> 23:23.220
but that'll be coming up during the FUs of the week. That's really it.

23:23.220 --> 23:26.220
How was your week? How was your day?

23:53.220 --> 24:10.220
You know, I've got to go back to Red Lobster at some point, because there's a waiter there, and I think he's gay, because he was giving us all this free food. It was me and two of my gay friends went over to Red Lobster. He started giving us, like, all this free food and didn't charge us for it. We didn't get charged for drinks. He brought us, like, double sides and stuff.

24:10.220 --> 24:12.220
I want to go with you.

24:12.220 --> 24:17.220
Islander's getting all kind of gay as he says, I want to go with you.

24:17.220 --> 24:22.980
No, I swear, there's like this pink mafia out there and, you know, I'm going to expose

24:22.980 --> 24:25.040
the secret here.

24:25.040 --> 24:29.320
If you get the slightest inclination that somebody at a particular service industry

24:29.320 --> 24:37.160
like, you know, at a store, at a restaurant might be, you know, gay, flirt with them.

24:37.160 --> 24:41.700
Because you'll get a discount or something or you'll, or if they suspect that you're

24:41.700 --> 24:46.220
at least like a gay rights supporter, you can get like breaks and stuff. It's really

24:46.220 --> 24:48.380
weird. That means I need to go into Red Lobster wearing

24:48.380 --> 24:54.380
a shirt that says HAG on it? Yeah. I'll tell you which waiter it is, too.

24:54.380 --> 25:00.740
Okay. I swear there's like a pink mafia out there.

25:00.740 --> 25:05.560
I don't know about that. But anyways, other than that, really, nothing

25:05.560 --> 25:10.800
has been going on. It's pretty much just been work stuff. I know we've got Sardella's people

25:10.800 --> 25:15.700
coming out in the week of the 20th, which I think is a couple weeks away now. So they're

25:15.700 --> 25:19.240
going to come out to which I guess I have to play them at some games or something, kick

25:19.240 --> 25:27.340
their ass, just because that's, you know, standard company procedure. And then today

25:27.340 --> 25:34.200
I went to Pizza Hut and I got two things of breadsticks and the pepperoni pizza, and I've

25:34.200 --> 25:39.060
eaten half of that. I still have one thing of breadsticks left, which I'm debating about

25:39.060 --> 25:44.620
keeping for later on because they're damn good fascinating really it is

25:44.620 --> 25:50.060
fascinating then today I had to build a computer for my sister and I have all I

25:50.060 --> 25:53.700
don't know where half of my motherboards went but I have a lot of crappy computer

25:53.700 --> 25:57.840
parts so she's gonna get a computer that's about comparable with what we

25:57.840 --> 26:02.260
used to run the show on and so the reason I say it's comparable is because

26:02.260 --> 26:08.580
it's almost out of the same parts and really other than that there's not much

26:08.580 --> 26:30.580
What did you think of the new one?

26:30.580 --> 26:33.580
I have a complaint about that movie.

26:33.580 --> 26:34.580
What's that?

26:34.580 --> 26:35.580
I haven't seen it yet, so no spoilers.

26:35.580 --> 26:37.580
General Grievous.

26:37.580 --> 26:41.020
I heard how just kick-ass he was in the Clone Wars cartoon.

26:41.020 --> 26:44.740
Yeah, he...

26:44.740 --> 26:49.140
Damn it, it's hard for me to make my major complaint, or else I'll spill it for Rob.

26:49.140 --> 26:53.340
That's okay. But it's just something about Obi-Wan riding a giant iguana.

26:53.340 --> 26:57.380
Yeah, there was some iguana riding,

26:57.380 --> 27:00.700
I don't know, it's weird. Yeah, it's weird. Interesting.

27:00.700 --> 27:05.100
I'm supposed to see it Tuesday. Okay. Me and some of the Pink Mafia are going

27:05.100 --> 27:10.100
Why aren't you listening to pump up the volume?

27:10.100 --> 27:16.860
Maybe we'll get in free, I don't know, because I'm trying to revive my own show at some point,

27:16.860 --> 27:21.820
so between that and karaoke I don't have a lot of free weeknights.

27:21.820 --> 27:24.180
Don't make me, like, haunt you or something.

27:24.180 --> 27:25.180
I'll TiVo it.

27:25.180 --> 27:30.500
Speaking of haunting, we're supposed to be scheduling another trip out to some remote

27:30.500 --> 27:33.660
cemetery that's uh... down by uh...

27:33.660 --> 27:36.020
dry town in uh... sutter creek

27:36.020 --> 27:39.620
and apparently it's on some guys land and we won't get bothered out there and

27:39.620 --> 27:41.380
yeah what ever happened to the ghost hunting

27:41.380 --> 27:44.100
uh... it's been on hiatus for a while just because

27:44.100 --> 27:48.140
a uh... moving and everything and b just

27:48.140 --> 27:52.180
we've been trying to get in contact with like local members of uh...

27:52.180 --> 27:53.800
i forget the

27:53.800 --> 27:56.380
there's an actual organization that people sign up for

27:56.380 --> 28:00.300
which i really don't think there's a big deal behind it but it's just like

28:00.300 --> 28:03.940
they have like standard protocol they take or something like that. So when you go ghost

28:03.940 --> 28:07.880
hunting, is it like Luigi's Mansion? No, it's not like Luigi's Mansion. Did you take a vacuum

28:07.880 --> 28:13.820
cleaner? No. Did you strap a vacuum cleaner on your back? It's not like that at all. It's

28:13.820 --> 28:19.180
mainly, it's just kind of like surveying, basically just take readings of areas and

28:19.180 --> 28:26.540
whatnot. The thing that I would probably be doing though that most normal people would

28:26.540 --> 28:31.760
be doing is they usually don't try to disturb the area whereas I believe it's

28:31.760 --> 28:35.300
like if you if you want like you know the rat to come out of the woodpile you

28:35.300 --> 28:40.960
got to start shaking the woodpile for that to happen so same sense and you

28:40.960 --> 28:44.720
know this if you want if you want something to happen you got to piss it

28:44.720 --> 28:54.560
off so Mario anyways but no that's it's no supposedly we're just gonna go chill

28:54.560 --> 28:57.920
down there we were gonna do an all-nighter thing but uh my fiance didn't

28:57.920 --> 29:02.260
like that idea so um instead we're gonna go down there at dusk and hang out

29:02.260 --> 29:06.440
during the night for a little bit she goes ghost hunting in Alabama because we

29:06.440 --> 29:10.940
actually have old cemeteries well this is an old cemetery too these are from

29:10.940 --> 29:19.040
like the 1700s and 1600s I don't talk to old people so fun no anyways I don't

29:19.040 --> 29:24.540
have a picture of a ghost yeah but you know everyone has a picture of Michael

29:24.540 --> 29:30.540
So it's okay. Anyways, that's all. I'm done.

29:30.540 --> 29:34.540
Islander, how was your week and how was your day?

29:34.540 --> 29:41.540
My week started off at Fanime, actually. A big anime convention down in the Bay Area.

29:41.540 --> 29:50.540
And I woke up, unfortunately, with a hangover. Too many tequila shots, not a good thing.

29:50.540 --> 30:00.540
And either my roommate or someone down there got me sick, so the entire week I've been fighting a cold, I'm pretty much getting over it at this point.

30:00.540 --> 30:07.540
Today, I was in the mood for Pump It Up, another dance simulation game.

30:07.540 --> 30:12.540
Pump It Up? Really? I've never heard of it. I'm just kidding. For those of you who don't know.

30:12.540 --> 30:15.540
I think most of our listeners know Pump It Up. I hope you do.

30:15.540 --> 30:17.540
If you don't, Korean five panels.

30:17.540 --> 30:19.540
Yeah, that's it. That's all I need to know.

30:19.540 --> 30:21.540
So I had to drive all the way down to Florin Mall.

30:21.540 --> 30:23.540
They still have Pump It Up there?

30:23.540 --> 30:26.540
They still have Pump It Up there, and they have a Dance Freaks.

30:26.540 --> 30:28.540
OMG!

30:28.540 --> 30:30.540
Yes, the Korean version of Dance Mania X.

30:30.540 --> 30:32.540
OMG, I have to go play this.

30:32.540 --> 30:34.540
Do they have different songs in it?

30:34.540 --> 30:37.540
It's basically DMX1 with a few K-Pop songs thrown in.

30:37.540 --> 30:39.540
Are any decent K-Pop songs?

30:39.540 --> 30:42.540
Um, there's a few good ones.

30:42.540 --> 30:43.540
Is Starion in it?

30:43.540 --> 30:44.540
No, unfortunately, Caution is not in it.

30:44.540 --> 30:46.540
How about Starion? It's in every other K-Pop song.

30:46.540 --> 30:47.540
Is Starion in it, really?

30:47.540 --> 30:53.540
Sorry I'm not in it, but there is a Bae G. Young song called Dash. There is a few songs...

30:53.540 --> 30:55.540
Oh, Dash and... Dash and...

30:55.540 --> 30:57.540
I knew it was in another game.

30:57.540 --> 30:59.540
Oh, that's not bad.

30:59.540 --> 31:06.540
There's a few other K-Pop groups that I recognize, like Seshki's, Klon, whatever.

31:06.540 --> 31:10.540
But yeah, I went down there for Pump It Up, of all things.

31:10.540 --> 31:13.540
And you're shaking your head in disgust, though, as you say that.

31:13.540 --> 31:31.540
Because for a couple days I've been itching to play because my good friend Floatwalk, Mel B, linked me to this site for PIU that had just a bunch of old videos, not freestyle or routine videos, but actual music videos for a lot of those songs.

31:31.540 --> 31:36.540
And I was like, oh my gosh. And all of a sudden I had this inkling to go play all of a sudden.

31:36.540 --> 31:38.540
Have you ever seen a video for Baquah?

31:38.540 --> 31:40.540
Yes.

31:40.540 --> 31:41.540
Doesn't it suck?

31:41.540 --> 31:43.540
Yeah, because she turns into a mermaid

31:43.900 --> 31:48.680
Yeah, I like was watching it going what the hell I was expecting because the quads such a kind of like

31:48.680 --> 31:51.460
I don't know it strikes me as a very angsty kind of song

31:51.580 --> 31:57.780
Mm-hmm, and I was just been here like be kicking some ass or something not frickin sitting on the rock being the little mermaid. Yeah

31:58.980 --> 32:00.380
exactly, I

32:00.380 --> 32:05.740
Was expecting her little crab friend and fish flounder to pop up and start singing along, you know

32:05.740 --> 32:20.980
I'm actually trying to read up on what's going on with that Pump It Up tourney.

32:20.980 --> 32:25.040
I know there was one a couple weeks ago in Dallas, Texas that was going on.

32:25.040 --> 32:29.140
It was one of those qualifiers for the big Pump It Up tournament in Korea, but I haven't

32:29.140 --> 32:33.860
heard anything else about future qualifiers since then.

32:33.860 --> 32:36.860
I'd be really mad if that's the only, like, qualifying training in the United States.

32:36.860 --> 32:42.860
That would suck, but there's got to be one that happens in the Bay at some point.

32:42.860 --> 32:48.860
Because, you know, Dallas is, you know, right in the middle for this big country for everyone to go to.

32:48.860 --> 32:51.860
I was looking over on Mastiff's site to see if they have anything on it,

32:51.860 --> 32:57.860
and they are still plugging a Smidget being at the Metreon on February 11th.

32:57.860 --> 33:00.860
Which, by the way, I didn't even know the Metreon had Pump It Up.

33:00.860 --> 33:05.900
I don't think they do, so they must have wheeled in a machine for that, unless they replaced

33:05.900 --> 33:06.900
one of their other machines.

33:06.900 --> 33:07.900
I'm not sure.

33:07.900 --> 33:11.380
Now I'm trying to check out a Marrow site and see if they have anything going on.

33:11.380 --> 33:17.980
And I don't see anything, but I'll keep looking.

33:17.980 --> 33:19.300
Maybe somebody in our chat room knows.

33:19.300 --> 33:21.140
If anybody in our chat room knows, feel free to share.

33:21.140 --> 33:24.740
We'll read it on air and try to get what's going on with that tournament, because I'm

33:24.740 --> 33:28.100
sure a lot of people that aren't just in Texas want to qualify what's going on

33:28.100 --> 33:33.980
there so um let's see my week in my day but may I be the first to say that I

33:33.980 --> 33:37.220
missed having three-day weekends the golf club was a lot of fun last Sunday

33:37.220 --> 33:43.340
actually I don't want to go again like I could tonight but not me now at work and

33:43.340 --> 33:47.120
everything but well I've worked tomorrow but I'd be there till 9 that's the

33:47.120 --> 33:52.420
spirit um the golf club was actually quite a bit of fun I was I was wearing

33:52.420 --> 33:55.780
one of the brightest shirts there. I was wearing my shirts... He could see you from across the

33:55.780 --> 34:00.340
room. I was wearing... See, because most people at the goth club wear all black. Or sometimes,

34:00.340 --> 34:05.700
like the gothy goths wear white because, you know, they're going to be different. I wore a

34:05.700 --> 34:11.060
bright ass red shirt because it was my engrish.com shirt and it said I hate myself and I want to die

34:11.060 --> 34:14.980
because I thought that would be appropriate for the goth club with little rainbows and hearts.

34:14.980 --> 34:20.900
It looks like a box of lucky charms. So we had a good time. What else did I do this week? Not a

34:20.900 --> 34:25.820
whole lot I saw the movie crash I think on was that Memorial Day that I saw

34:25.820 --> 34:29.620
that or maybe it was last Sunday I don't know I don't know but I am to you after

34:29.620 --> 34:34.860
I just got done watching Team America World Police I'm so ornery and you were

34:34.860 --> 34:40.340
watching a South Park movie yeah no I went I went saw crash I think that was

34:40.340 --> 34:47.700
on Monday which was good it's just very unapologetic and in-your-face type thing

34:47.700 --> 34:53.300
where some of the language is very raw. It's a movie that deals with racism so

34:53.300 --> 34:58.420
if the n-word makes you uncomfortable or any of the other various racial slurs

34:58.420 --> 35:02.260
Loki you'd have no problem with this movie if any of those various racial

35:02.260 --> 35:06.340
slurs make you uncomfortable but I don't actually was a really good movie it was

35:06.340 --> 35:11.140
really good really well done so I recommend it otherwise not a whole lot

35:11.140 --> 35:18.700
going on I went out to play in the groove actually twice this week I just

35:18.700 --> 35:24.700
well you know what I'm loving the USB support thing because one reason I like

35:24.700 --> 35:29.220
the way in the groove has its workout mode set up is that you don't have to do

35:29.220 --> 35:33.020
like a special mode to have it count your calories it actually counts your

35:33.020 --> 35:36.420
calories while you're playing a normal game this kind of bugs me about DDR I

35:36.420 --> 35:40.580
don't know why it's such a little-ass problem but I wish that and I think the

35:40.580 --> 35:44.840
only game that ever did this was Disney's rave funny enough that Disney's

35:44.840 --> 35:48.420
rave is the only DDR game that did a lot of things correctly let's say dance

35:48.420 --> 35:53.180
magic and then it counts your calories no matter what mode you're playing in

35:53.180 --> 35:57.140
the reason why I don't like workout mode in like PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions

35:57.140 --> 36:02.580
is that if you play a workout mode you don't unlock new songs you don't

36:02.580 --> 36:08.140
technically save your grades or your scores or anything so there's no point

36:08.140 --> 36:11.580
and playing in workout mode unless you are strictly there to burn calories. But I like

36:11.580 --> 36:14.620
to unlock songs as I play DDR. I don't know about the rest of you, but that's part of

36:14.620 --> 36:20.260
the fun of it, so. Anyway, so In the Groove has the fantastic USB support. Say what you

36:20.260 --> 36:26.260
will about the game, but the USB support is fantastic, so I've been having fun with that.

36:26.260 --> 36:31.300
The game itself, eh, it's just kind of holding me over until there's a new DDR, which, I

36:31.300 --> 36:34.620
don't know, I'm not going to hold my breath at this point, but maybe some home versions

36:34.620 --> 36:37.640
this fall. I don't know, we'll see. Well, we know there's whole versions, but you know.

36:37.640 --> 36:48.000
I want new arcade stuff. Really bad. Okay. Moving on. Let's see what's going on in the

36:48.000 --> 36:51.640
Bamani world news-wise. I thought we had a...

36:51.640 --> 36:56.020
I know two things. What's that? Jack and... No, I'm kidding.

36:56.020 --> 36:59.780
It's really a slow... If video gaming and all together is kind of a slow news period

36:59.780 --> 37:02.600
right now, it's kind of sad. It's on vacation after E3.

37:02.600 --> 37:04.600
Yeah, it really is.

37:04.600 --> 37:08.600
Checking some of the headlines recently over on TedDDRFreak, which by the way,

37:08.600 --> 37:10.600
replays our show on Friday nights.

37:10.600 --> 37:12.600
Those lovely folks over there.

37:12.600 --> 37:13.600
Yes.

37:13.600 --> 37:20.600
They actually had like a legal perspective, explain the Konami vs. Rockstar thing,

37:20.600 --> 37:24.600
which if you were totally confused by the lawsuit, I would hope that if you

37:24.600 --> 37:27.600
listened to our program a couple weeks ago when that subject first came up,

37:27.600 --> 37:29.600
that we helped explain things for you.

37:29.600 --> 37:34.880
you're still lost they kind of had somebody that is in law school or

37:34.880 --> 37:39.520
recently finished with law school try to kind of explain it a little more so it's

37:39.520 --> 37:43.840
it's a fun read so check that out also very interesting that's brought up in

37:43.840 --> 37:48.240
there is that rock source supposed to have like 20 days to do a response to

37:48.240 --> 37:52.320
the lawsuit so it'll be interesting because sometime this week even though

37:52.320 --> 37:55.440
it's been over 20 days it might be 20 business days I don't know how it works

37:55.440 --> 38:01.200
But, somebody, we're thinking this week we might get some more information on exactly

38:01.200 --> 38:07.220
what Roxor's comment is going to be to that. Or, as I predict, the out-of-court settlement

38:07.220 --> 38:11.480
will happen very soon. But we'll see.

38:11.480 --> 38:16.160
And then of course there were some new trailers posted over on IGN.com for DDR Extreme 2 and

38:16.160 --> 38:21.400
UltraMix 3, which really don't show anything new as far as I remember from looking at the

38:21.400 --> 38:25.240
trailers. There's really nothing new in it. And then the BeatMania trailer is available

38:25.240 --> 38:29.800
of our games are fun, but it's the same damn thing they showed at E3.

38:29.800 --> 38:31.080
Exactly the same thing.

38:31.080 --> 38:32.920
Really not a lot new.

38:32.920 --> 38:38.320
New news possibly on Xtreme 2 at Comic Con, if it's going to be anything like last year.

38:38.320 --> 38:43.120
You remember last year at Comic Con in July in San Diego, they actually brought a build

38:43.120 --> 38:47.880
of Xtreme, last year it was Xtreme, and we found out some new songs that way.

38:47.880 --> 38:51.360
So we're hoping that this year they'll do the same thing, and we'll find out some new

38:51.360 --> 38:53.520
stuff for Xtreme 2.

38:53.520 --> 38:54.520
We shall see.

38:54.520 --> 39:01.460
will be very interesting. Anyway, I think what we'll do right now is we'll take a quick

39:01.460 --> 39:06.960
break and then we'll come back and... I get to break stuff, yay! We'll talk about your

39:06.960 --> 39:11.320
news when we come back, Loki, don't worry. And then we'll also get into tonight's cage

39:11.320 --> 39:17.360
match very soon as well as your calls via the Skype line, www.orangelaungeradio.com.

39:17.360 --> 39:20.820
By the way, we're looking into this new thing we might do. I actually, this is the first

39:20.820 --> 39:24.360
time I have even said this to the others because Jason brought this to my

39:24.360 --> 39:27.560
attention just like two days ago but there's actually this new thing called

39:27.560 --> 39:33.640
Skype in where we could get a phone number and then if somebody calls the

39:33.640 --> 39:38.160
phone number it'll come in on Skype so we'll probably be looking into that so

39:38.160 --> 39:40.740
possibly in the very near future orange launch radio for those of you that don't

39:40.740 --> 39:44.820
get the Skype thing or don't want it we will have a phone number that you can

39:44.820 --> 39:49.500
call to be on the program so that will be a very cool addition we'll see all

39:49.500 --> 39:53.500
Alright, anyway. After this break, we'll be back with more Orange Launch Radio.

39:53.500 --> 39:56.500
And this break, music from 2DX Night Style.

39:56.500 --> 40:01.500
Started off with a popular song from 2DX Night Style, but we haven't played it in a while, so...

40:01.500 --> 40:08.500
I thought you kids would enjoy this. Lion Ski!

40:31.500 --> 40:41.380
I cannot lie, I'm a killer, I am a sick and guy

40:41.380 --> 40:55.700
I cannot lie, I'm a killer, I am a sick and guy

41:55.700 --> 42:00.700
I am the same picky guy

43:55.700 --> 43:57.700
Let's go!

44:55.700 --> 44:57.700
Let's go!

44:57.700 --> 44:59.700
Let's go!

46:59.700 --> 47:01.700
Oh

47:29.700 --> 47:56.100
And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's

47:56.100 --> 47:59.260
favourite perverse Bomani band, E-rotic.

47:59.260 --> 48:01.820
Do it all night. Do it with me.

48:01.820 --> 48:04.460
No, no, that was awful, bloody terrible.

48:04.460 --> 48:07.100
Do you take vocal lessons? Kill your teacher!

48:07.100 --> 48:08.620
In the heat of the night.

48:08.620 --> 48:11.220
Oh, God, I think my ears are bleeding.

48:11.220 --> 48:13.220
I liked it.

48:13.220 --> 48:15.820
Shut the bloody hell up, Paula. Next.

48:15.820 --> 48:18.300
Oh...

48:18.300 --> 48:21.060
That was cool.

48:21.060 --> 48:23.180
Do you even know why you're here?

48:23.180 --> 48:25.620
That was just bloody pathetic. Next.

48:25.620 --> 48:32.620
Yes, yes, that's it! We have a winner! A Star is Born, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

48:39.900 --> 48:46.300
God, that promo's old. I thought with the whole American Idol stuff, it's not even that

48:46.300 --> 48:52.240
good compared to some of our other promos, but I thought with the whole American Idol

48:52.240 --> 48:57.200
thing going on this past couple weeks that, you know, that it was time to play that again.

48:57.200 --> 49:01.800
So congratulations to Carrie Underwood, your erotic pop idol, who I'm sure will be a playboy

49:01.800 --> 49:04.760
in a matter of years, because that's where most of those pop idols are headed.

49:04.760 --> 49:06.560
I haven't even followed it since Carrie.

49:06.560 --> 49:08.560
Carrie Underwood is useless.

49:08.560 --> 49:11.480
I can sing country music, but can you sing pop music?

49:11.480 --> 49:14.880
I can sing country music, but can you sing pop music?

49:14.880 --> 49:15.880
Country music?

49:15.880 --> 49:16.880
No, pop music!

49:16.880 --> 49:17.880
Pop!

49:17.880 --> 49:20.400
That's all she could do.

49:20.400 --> 49:21.960
Every song she sang was a country song.

49:21.960 --> 49:26.920
so going to be on the surreal life in two years. I haven't followed it since I bought

49:26.920 --> 49:32.920
Clay's album. I did buy Clay's album and I was proud of it because he has a good voice.

49:32.920 --> 49:41.920
But he has a really good voice. What happened to Clay Aiken? I don't know but he's pretty.

49:41.920 --> 49:48.600
He's invisible. We don't know what happened to him. You have to understand what happened

49:48.600 --> 49:53.400
was, is there was a rival between Ruben and Clay.

49:53.400 --> 49:58.360
Biggie, Ruben, and Clay, you see, and they gunned him down.

49:58.360 --> 50:01.720
Oh, I figured that Ruben just ate Clay.

50:01.720 --> 50:05.360
Actually, Ruben was having, I think,

50:05.360 --> 50:08.280
to visit a nutritionist because he was going,

50:08.280 --> 50:10.280
he was saying he was comfortable in his own body,

50:10.280 --> 50:12.400
but he's actually starting to develop heart issues

50:12.400 --> 50:14.200
and things last I checked.

50:14.200 --> 50:16.280
We saw people going to die?

50:16.280 --> 50:23.280
He's the people who's going to, I don't know, but there's been a big health concern regarding

50:23.280 --> 50:26.280
the fact that he's basically put on a hundred pounds since he won.

50:26.280 --> 50:27.280
No, it's too bad.

50:27.280 --> 50:28.280
Dang!

50:28.280 --> 50:29.280
A hundred more?

50:29.280 --> 50:30.280
So I've heard.

50:30.280 --> 50:31.820
He needs to start playing some DDR.

50:31.820 --> 50:37.840
The bigger I am, the bigger I am on the charts.

50:37.840 --> 50:41.120
That's just, but he, I know that he's gained a lot of weight since then.

50:41.120 --> 50:43.600
Look at the comparison pictures.

50:43.600 --> 50:45.520
He's a big boy now.

50:45.520 --> 50:52.400
Wow, who was that rap artist like way back in the day, you know, that used to be like heavy D. Yeah heavy D

50:53.020 --> 50:55.020
Dude heavy D was cool

50:55.720 --> 51:00.000
Dude Biz Markie with me and the boys Biz Markie was on that a vh1

51:00.700 --> 51:05.360
Get fit show celebrity fit club. I love Biz Markie and the Snapple lady

51:06.560 --> 51:11.400
She was on that too. Yes, she was as well as me a Tyler who else anyway

51:11.400 --> 51:16.280
This is what happens when there's not a lot of DDR. We start talking about VH1 shows.

51:16.280 --> 51:18.960
By the way, Surreal Life 5 is going to rock.

51:18.960 --> 51:21.000
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I saw...

51:21.000 --> 51:22.920
Who's this time around?

51:22.920 --> 51:23.920
Did you know...

51:23.920 --> 51:26.320
Bronson Pinchot from Perfect Strangers, Balki.

51:26.320 --> 51:27.320
Yes.

51:27.320 --> 51:31.480
In the same house with Omarosa from The Apprentice and Janice Dickinson from America's Next Top

51:31.480 --> 51:36.800
Model. Which, by the way, if America's Next Top Model is not your guilty pleasure show,

51:36.800 --> 51:40.440
it should be. Because that show... What a bunch of bitches!

51:40.440 --> 51:41.440
Seriously.

51:41.440 --> 51:47.500
Nelly was watching this one show yesterday on VH1, I guess it's called Strip Search.

51:47.500 --> 51:49.640
I'm surprised, Rob, you haven't heard of this.

51:49.640 --> 51:53.560
Actually, my roommate watches Strip Search every week.

51:53.560 --> 51:56.160
Okay, I was like, this is weird.

51:56.160 --> 51:57.520
He's probably watching it right now.

51:57.520 --> 52:02.560
I was overhearing it while I was uploading my MySpace site, which I'll have to cover

52:02.560 --> 52:03.560
later.

52:03.560 --> 52:09.160
And so, it's just like, I guess they make these guys do their strip dances in the middle

52:09.160 --> 52:12.880
like where they're working or whatever and i think that they can go and compete

52:12.880 --> 52:16.520
to become like the next uh... sundown down under yes

52:16.520 --> 52:18.800
center from down under shell

52:18.800 --> 52:20.560
but uh...

52:20.560 --> 52:23.800
yeah i got thunder down under it's called my fat thighs

52:23.800 --> 52:25.640
i don't know about you

52:25.640 --> 52:27.840
uh...

52:27.840 --> 52:31.400
the holy title vote for a clap them together by make a thunderous noise i

52:31.400 --> 52:32.140
don't know

52:32.140 --> 52:32.920
anyway

52:32.920 --> 52:36.640
the holy time of work and i don't know and i don't know

52:36.640 --> 52:40.920
American Idol. I think I made Islander just throw up in his mouth a little bit, though.

52:40.920 --> 52:44.880
American Idol. Well, since we were talking about American Idol, have you seen the

52:44.880 --> 52:48.380
previews for that show, Do You Think You Can Dance?

52:48.380 --> 52:53.400
No. Is that the dance show on ABC? That's the dance show that's going to be on Fox.

52:53.400 --> 52:57.880
Fucking all these reality shows. It's going to be, imagine American Idol except

52:57.880 --> 52:59.820
dancing.

52:59.820 --> 53:01.180
I should go on that show.

53:01.180 --> 53:02.760
Including the people that can't dance.

53:02.760 --> 53:04.720
No, you know what show actually I should go on?

53:04.720 --> 53:06.480
Beauty and the Geek.

53:06.480 --> 53:10.400
i thought i would only think this show is up no seriously for the previews i

53:10.400 --> 53:13.180
thought the show is going to be a big pile of trash

53:13.180 --> 53:16.280
it actually was a really cute show

53:16.280 --> 53:19.760
i thought i don't know about you know it's uh...

53:19.760 --> 53:22.920
it's all these like a really nerdy guys when i thought they were going to be

53:22.920 --> 53:26.560
like more nerdy of the bill gates look at the three-year-old yeah like the

53:26.560 --> 53:29.700
three doors that they've been a few days

53:29.700 --> 53:32.160
and uh... that you've been to the

53:32.160 --> 53:34.760
they put up against like playboy models

53:34.760 --> 53:38.480
But the thing is, is that then they go in competitions.

53:38.480 --> 53:40.800
And they pair off, and they have to do competitions.

53:40.800 --> 53:44.940
So the geeks have to teach the models how to spell.

53:44.940 --> 53:48.000
And then the models have to teach the geeks how to dance

53:48.000 --> 53:49.560
and how to do social things.

53:49.560 --> 53:51.360
So actually, in the first episode,

53:51.360 --> 53:54.140
they had a dance competition for the geeks.

53:54.140 --> 53:57.240
And the models were in, what, a fifth grade spelling bee?

53:57.240 --> 53:58.560
Or what were they doing?

53:58.560 --> 53:59.320
Yeah.

53:59.320 --> 54:00.680
That has to be hilarious.

54:00.680 --> 54:03.840
It was so great, because the one girl was like, tattoo.

54:03.840 --> 54:11.440
T-A-T-O-O, she got all excited because she won, and then they're like, no, it's not like

54:11.440 --> 54:12.440
that.

54:12.440 --> 54:19.360
But it was really, like, the way they do it, they do it without it being demeaning, I think.

54:19.360 --> 54:22.320
Like it's poking fun without being malicious.

54:22.320 --> 54:26.500
And like, a shot like that would be followed up immediately with the girl who actually

54:26.500 --> 54:27.500
wins it.

54:27.500 --> 54:31.700
She's going, I feel so great right now because I've never won an intelligence competition

54:31.700 --> 54:38.700
in my entire life until today.

55:01.700 --> 55:03.700
Is it Wannabamani?

55:03.700 --> 55:06.700
Wannabamani? I guess?

55:06.700 --> 55:09.700
Anyways, let me see here.

55:09.700 --> 55:14.700
Basically, I decided, you know, it's been a while since we heard something about those other games that are out there,

55:14.700 --> 55:20.700
so I figured I'd go take a peek and see what's actually being worked on.

55:20.700 --> 55:23.700
So, Neon FM is where all the news is right now.

55:23.700 --> 55:29.140
now apparently they've had a kind of an invitation only you know debuting of

55:29.140 --> 55:32.820
their machine and stuff which looks pretty cool and considering it's all

55:32.820 --> 55:38.940
being done by scratch it's pretty awesome and what they've got so far it

55:38.940 --> 55:45.500
will basically you've got something that looks kind of similar to DVR not really

55:45.500 --> 55:51.060
it's basically you've got five panels on each side a range kind of like a normal

55:51.060 --> 55:57.060
beat mania controller, you know, back in the five key days, without the turntable.

55:57.060 --> 56:00.060
Well, yeah, obviously without the turntable. That'd be a little weird if it had...

56:00.060 --> 56:03.060
But that would be fun! Ice skating revolution!

56:03.060 --> 56:11.060
Exactly. So basically, we've got those, and it's basically, they were showing some of the screenshots

56:11.060 --> 56:16.060
and more of the gameplay, and they basically, they, I guess, debuted this at Betzen.

56:16.060 --> 56:19.960
for those who don't know, Betzen is an arcade parts

56:19.960 --> 56:23.820
supplier and they're the ones actually building the machines for

56:23.820 --> 56:27.780
the NFM and they actually debuted it I guess at one of their

56:27.780 --> 56:28.980
warehouses there

56:28.980 --> 56:34.180
so that's kind of interesting to see. Some more interesting stuff that's happening right now

56:34.180 --> 56:38.740
I guess Thomas Howard, the same Thomas Howard that may be featured in

56:38.740 --> 56:43.780
La Senorita and all that stuff. He's actually going to... Captain T!

56:43.780 --> 56:49.780
Captain T. Yes, he's actually going to Japan right now to film a live performance with

56:49.780 --> 56:52.940
the other artist that sings Girls Butts.

56:52.940 --> 56:56.220
And they're doing the live video that's going to be in the background for that song right

56:56.220 --> 56:57.220
now.

56:57.220 --> 57:01.420
Oh god, this is, Girls Butts is going to be the reason to play.

57:01.420 --> 57:09.800
And honestly, what else, oh, they've got, there's, what else, damn, where did my clip

57:09.800 --> 57:11.800
of Girls Butts go?

57:11.800 --> 57:12.800
I used to have it.

57:12.800 --> 57:16.000
Don't worry about it, we'll be able to get you some clips in a little bit.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.280
I'm going to download this other thing.

57:18.280 --> 57:21.880
It's basically 20 second samples of a bunch of different songs.

57:21.880 --> 57:26.520
But we actually have some of the full length songs, not obviously the same cut that's going

57:26.520 --> 57:32.640
to be in the game, but from Poppin Co., which is one of the artists that does the music

57:32.640 --> 57:33.680
in the game.

57:33.680 --> 57:36.960
And it's some pretty interesting generic stuff right now.

57:36.960 --> 57:39.080
Are we going to play clips from these songs here?

57:39.080 --> 57:40.880
I suppose we should just play clips, yeah.

57:40.880 --> 57:42.360
Let's just play clips, because these are kind of long.

57:42.360 --> 57:46.960
So here's a clip of all these songs in the game, because there's two songs here called

57:46.960 --> 57:47.960
Complete Shot.

57:47.960 --> 57:52.480
Uh, Complete Shot, I think the Greek fire mix is not in the game, but the other one

57:52.480 --> 57:53.480
is.

57:53.480 --> 57:57.400
Then let's play a clip here of the club blend mix of Complete Shot.

57:57.400 --> 57:58.400
Here it is.

57:58.400 --> 58:05.400
neon FM.

58:15.960 --> 58:18.600
Is this like their version of Max 300 or what is this?

58:18.600 --> 58:21.000
No, I think it's probably just

58:21.000 --> 58:26.240
more stuff to it. You know, it's because it's a long version of the song.

58:26.240 --> 58:53.520
p0k3smot42o

58:53.520 --> 58:55.520
Not too shabby. Not too shabby.

58:55.520 --> 58:57.520
Better sound than in the groove.

58:57.520 --> 59:00.520
Well, they're different. I don't know. It's hard to say.

59:00.520 --> 59:03.520
Alright, here's a clip of the other song. This is Electro 8.

59:03.520 --> 59:05.520
Yeah, enjoy this one.

59:33.520 --> 59:44.520
It's okay. It sounds like an old Game Boy game or something. I don't know. It's kind

59:44.520 --> 59:45.520
of weird.

59:45.520 --> 59:46.520
Exactly.

59:46.520 --> 59:47.520
Okay.

59:47.520 --> 59:52.600
Now, you can find those songs that we just played on popnko.com. That's P-O-P-N-K-O.com.

59:52.600 --> 59:59.160
And they actually have screenshots from the May 13th prototype party where they had it

59:59.160 --> 01:00:02.880
at Betzen and you can actually see pictures of the cabinet and actually if

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:08.520
you go to neonfm.com you can check out they have more screens or actual shots

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:12.560
of the cabinet that you can see the actual buttons and stuff and it looks

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:15.360
pretty cool actually so far and they've done a pretty good job with the game I

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:19.320
believe I wish they just call it feet mania because that would be because it

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:24.000
looks it looks really cool from what they've got so far I mean it just makes

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:31.360
It makes me think, though, of stepping selection, and I have bad, bad, traumatized memories

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:32.640
of stepping selection.

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:33.640
You know what?

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:38.360
I'm actually excited about Neon FM.

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:43.000
I think they're doing a lot of things right, and sadly, I think the reason why they're

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000
doing a lot of things right is because they've been able to learn from everything In The

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.200
Groove did wrong.

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:50.640
And here's the other thing, too, which is going to be before everyone starts going,

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:54.760
Well, they're actually working with Konami of America throughout the entire process of

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:55.760
developing this game.

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:59.120
That's what I think is, like, really kind of weird in a way.

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:03.000
Not really, I mean, because it's not bad, it's just weird.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.680
It makes sense because they're getting feedback from them, what they think, and also they're

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:10.780
making sure that all their bases are covered, like, you know, hey, is there anything we're

01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:15.560
infringing on that we need to be copyright, you know, paying you for, you know, licensing

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:17.840
and stuff, and they're taking care of all that.

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:21.120
you should be giving us fifty million dollars

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:24.240
but i honestly i don't think this is going to be much of a problem compared

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:26.060
to like say you know

01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:29.560
in the group which looked exactly like the year this is at least

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:33.360
doesn't get the reasonable the new cabinet new dance pad they've kind of

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:36.440
real even in the screens it doesn't look anything like the year because the way

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:40.080
they've rearranged things so it's yet very different

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:43.160
that's why i i get i give the game a lot of credit and

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:46.040
i hope it catches on enough so that we see this in

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:50.840
Honestly, I just am glad to see something that's, you know, different than, say, you

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:55.560
know, DDR or Pump It Up, you know, something that'll be, you know, a little different.

01:01:55.560 --> 01:02:01.440
Also, if you, ooh, good comment from our chat room. Ron Chan says, maybe the FM in Neon

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:07.040
FM stands for Feet Mania. I like that. So, Neon Feet Mania.

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:08.040
We have a genius.

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:13.080
And here's another thing, also, in case you're interested. There's a link on Neon FM's site

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:18.180
here where you can actually download ringtones for your cell phone, one of them being Girl's

01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:19.180
Butts.

01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:20.180
Yes!

01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:21.180
Fun.

01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:24.520
Dude, I'm so downloading that for my, does it support Sprint or do we know?

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:30.720
Um, well they have a picture here, it shows M-Mode, so, M-Mode would be, I believe, um,

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:31.720
the AT&T.

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:32.720
That's not Sprint.

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:33.720
Sprint is...

01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:36.600
But, it's just, they're MIDI files, I mean, come on, I mean, any phone should be able

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:37.600
to download that.

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:38.600
That's awesome.

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:39.600
So that's your...

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:41.700
I can't find my clip of Girl's Butts.

01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:46.700
I'm downloading. I have a thing downloading right now, which I will actually give to you if you give me my flash drive back.

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:47.700
Thank you. I will.

01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:55.700
That's a 20 second clip of about 13 to 20 different songs, and you'll be able to hear a lot more of what's going to be in there right now.

01:02:55.700 --> 01:02:59.700
So I guess I'll throw it on here, and we'll play it later.

01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:01.700
Okay. We can do that.

01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:05.700
Sounds good. So we'll play that later. More Neon FM.

01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:09.700
Any idea when they're going to release this? Any word of a release date yet?

01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:10.700
Not yet.

01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:14.560
talk to somebody over on the team over there and try to get somebody on this show to give

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:21.560
us details. Okay. And I also want girls' butts dedicated to me.

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:29.200
I was going to say some other stuff non-related. I have a MySpace site, another one now that

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:38.360
I've been plugging in our live journal community, actually. It's MySpace.com slash Lowkey Fusion.

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:43.120
you can actually listen to brand new songs on there as they come out and I

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:46.440
don't upload them to my really shitty site and it plus I have a really cool

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:55.320
logo that you know looks just like the DR Ultramix 3 logo so it's spiffy um so

01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:59.680
go check it out befriend me do all that wonderful stuff um also if you placed at

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:06.000
mania someone actually made a sim file for what was it uh the legend of trans

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000
That was 2005, so go check that out in Bomani style.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000
That's a few pages back in there, sim file section there.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Which technically would count as another max sim file.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Good job, guys.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000
The background art, though, kind of sucks.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Anyways.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:30.000
And then, other than that, really not too much else going on.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
I think I found it.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000
I think I found it.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Oh, god.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:05:02.760
I have no idea, I think this is it, YES!

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:24.360
This is right here the song of the game.

01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:30.800
How can you not be excited about Neon Feet Mania after hearing that?

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:35.720
Now, that's not the same mix, though, because that doesn't sound like Thomas Howard.

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:38.240
That sounds like DJ Potato singing that.

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:39.240
Or is it?

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:40.240
Am I wrong?

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:41.240
I have no idea.

01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:42.240
I think that's DJ Potato actually singing that.

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:46.880
It might be DJ Potato singing, but the new one, I mean, I've gotta say that they're doing

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:52.360
quite a bit, I mean, they're putting quite a lot of polish in this game, I mean, getting

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:55.880
a live performance of Thomas Howard in Japan with the other artist, and apparently there's

01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:59.680
a female artist that does vocals on that song as well, so.

01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:05.680
I want, like, really, like, 80s porn, like, close-up shots of her butt in, like, tight clothing and stuff.

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:08.680
It has to be porn style. It has to be.

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:10.680
Even Dark Sakura is into me.

01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:12.680
Oh my God. Picture this.

01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:14.680
He's gotta be all pimped out with a hat.

01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:22.680
This woman throws at me every time I even mention they should objectify women in one form or another, and she agrees with me on this one.

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:29.680
This song! This song has to have it and the guy has to be all pimped out, but then the girl has to turn around and shoot him.

01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:39.680
I've got, you know, your video right here. You need to have, like, a really quick close-up shot of a door opening, and Thomas Howard singing this song is the pizza guy.

01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:43.680
That would be fucking awesome.

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:45.680
I still think the girl needs to go around and shoot.

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:50.680
They should parody a bunch of different porno videos.

01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:52.680
The temps should be a girl.

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:25.680
That could be, that should be the marketing for the game. They should have that printed on bumper stickers.

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:27.680
Featuring girls' butts.

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:34.680
It should just be neon, neon FM and really tiny print in the corner. Neon FM featuring girls' butts with a Z.

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:39.680
That song, awesome. That song needs to go on the radio.

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:45.680
Maybe we should have like a, maybe we should help them out. You know, we've got some artistic people on staff here.

01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:50.560
let's make some neon FM promo banners and we'll do that little neon FM

01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:55.560
featuring girls butts like really really huge and then have the 80s porn but I

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:59.360
think we should do that yeah we'll do it as a favor to neon FM and then maybe

01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:03.720
some of them will come on the show and talk about their game I like this idea

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:12.000
it has merit I think we'll go to a quick break when we come back we are gonna

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:18.720
take your calls over on the skype line www.orangelaunchradio.com click on interact with us and we'll get

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:24.200
into the cage match as well and maybe if we have time tonight uh we'll do like what do

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:27.840
you think listless tonight why not we haven't done that in a while we haven't done listless

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:32.300
in a while we have got sufficient people we have to think of a topic though so we'll we'll

01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:38.540
think about that ways to promote neon fm actually that might not be a bad idea that might not

01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:42.700
be a bad idea. So I have a feeling that if we do that, we will be taking an inside joke

01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:47.940
or a joke that was five minutes ago and just be ramming it into the ground.

01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:53.260
That's okay. Alright, we'll see. Okay, in this break, I thought maybe what we could

01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:58.660
do is actually place In the Groove's music this break because we've kind of been mean

01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:02.660
to them this break. Has In the Groove come out yet? Because apparently, and this is interesting,

01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:06.540
apparently someone I know at work, they're like, you know, I'm looking for a DDR game

01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:11.280
that has some Britney Spears songs in it because my, my daughter, okay, daughter's

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:16.080
ten-year-old, okay, now she's into the Britney Spears Christina Aguilera crap, they're looking

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:20.340
for a song that had some of that stuff, so I'm loaning her DDR Extreme Max 2. In return,

01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:25.480
she's loaning me In the Groove. For the home console. Apparently, she already has it. She

01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:31.000
says that's what it is. She says it looks exactly like DDR, except it does, you know,

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.640
I showed her pictures of In the Groove and she's like, I'm almost positive that's what

01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:39.960
it is so I get to see whatever if it is that's very odd because I don't I

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:43.400
haven't heard of it coming out yet and that you would be all over if it had

01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:46.880
come out I will see let me check let me check in fact let me just make sure I

01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:51.840
haven't missed something okay it g freak dot-com because this site would have it

01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:57.000
right yeah let's see that that that uh nope no news on the home version coming

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:03.360
out your co-workers insane or is gotten some some huge break somehow I don't

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:12.360
I don't know what she has, but I bet you anything that's MC Groove's dance craze or something like that, that's probably what you're going to get in return, that MC Groove.

01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:16.360
Either way, we'll have a review of whatever the hell it is that she has.

01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:20.360
Some subpar game.

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:25.360
What am I looking for in this room?

01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:29.360
The girls' bus thing just totally inspired me to open a restaurant.

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:30.360
Called what?

01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:36.320
Well, you know, this objectifying women thing is pretty stupid. I think that men should be objectified.

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.600
So I'm opening a restaurant called Heckers.

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:41.440
Hey, there's no problem with that. Or Bananas.

01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:46.960
It was in a commercial a while ago, I think. But it's a chicken restaurant like Hooters, so it's gonna be Heckers.

01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:51.800
Alright, well, I thought about the cool pool hall called, you know, Great Rack.

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:54.780
You can have that.

01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:57.640
That's horrible. Or, uh, Jail Bait.

01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:04.800
That'd be another song or another another restaurant where the theme would be you know women in like the schoolgirl outfits

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:07.040
You know hot Asian women jailbait

01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:09.840

01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:34.680

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:40.580
trance-y song called Walking on Fire because we haven't played this one yet on the show

01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:44.660
And it's it's kind of neat so enjoy this and we'll be back with more orange laundry

01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:18.580
All I can do is see all the helplessness behind me

01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:24.580
I've faded too, off the headline

01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:32.580
Crushing every feeling that sends me

01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:33.580

And you took part in the scene inside

01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:34.580
You said that there's nothin' wrong

01:16:34.580 --> 01:16:37.580

I'm Romeo, Juliet I'm Romeo, Juliet

01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:31.580
I'm Romeo, Juliet I'm Romeo, Juliet

01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:35.580
The only thing I know is that I can't use that instruction

01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:38.580
I was made with passion

01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:41.580
The only thing I know is that

01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:45.580
I'm feeling satisfaction

01:18:45.580 --> 01:18:50.580
Feeling satisfaction

01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:03.580
I am a robot

01:19:33.580 --> 01:19:37.580
Found this strange attraction

01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:41.580
Was made for you, my dear

01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:44.580
Was made for passion

01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:47.580
The only thing I know is that

01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:51.580
I could use that inspiration

01:19:51.580 --> 01:20:10.460
Gaming Radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us at Orange Lounge

01:20:10.460 --> 01:20:14.220
Radio.

01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:22.380
back here on orange lounge radio music there from in tech groove coming to a

01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:28.260
console near you eventually Romeo and Juliet before that touch me

01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:34.500
bubble dancer walking on fire starting that set off well diverse stuff in there

01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:39.780
I like bubble dancer because it sounds like aqua but like a real cheap aqua

01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:44.500
knockoff which makes it even worse but at the same time the only reason you

01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:48.540
liked aqua is because it was one of those it's so bad it's good so when it

01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:55.300
gets badder it gets gooder nevermind we're gonna take your calls right now on

01:20:55.300 --> 01:21:01.500
the skype line www.orangeloungeradio.com click on interact with us and you can

01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:03.960
call into the show although I don't know if we have a lot of people that want to

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:08.020
talk to us tonight because we don't have a lot of folks that are actually logged

01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:12.740
in to Skype right now so we'll see what happens. I don't know what's going on, I guess

01:21:12.740 --> 01:21:15.860
because school's winding down for some people so a lot of folks can't stay up

01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:19.900
late tonight because they have finals tomorrow so and you know for our East Coast

01:21:19.900 --> 01:21:23.260
listeners we're actually on pretty late. It's three hours later over there so

01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:28.620
we're looking at about 11 o'clock almost on the East Coast. Ouch. Well thank you to

01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:31.460
our dedicated folks on the East Coast who stay up all night long to listen to

01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:35.420
us but I guess during finals week it's a little bit harder so we're gonna have a

01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:39.400
a lot of people don't want to call in tonight. That's why you can check us out on Fridays.

01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:44.420
Yes, on Fridays over at DDR Freak, if you want. And you know, if no one calls us, we

01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:48.100
have to get into Paris Hilton chat. And I don't think you want that tonight, no I'm

01:21:48.100 --> 01:21:53.060
kidding. Even I'm sick of Paris Hilton chat. Nicole Richie chat, though. I've got a whole

01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:58.300
lot I could say about that. She sucks. She's Paris Hilton's partner. Oh, we're getting

01:21:58.300 --> 01:22:03.020
a call. Oh, on that stupid show. Yeah. I watched the sausage episode. Not anymore. Saved by

01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:07.600
the call. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Hey, Sky, Siggy here. Hello, Siggy, how are

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:14.600
you? I'm doing fine. What's on your mind, sir? Well, yeah, last Friday I was able to

01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:20.000
attend the World Series of Poker. Oh, yes, I remember you talking about that on last

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:25.060
week's show and you were going to win us millions of dollars, right? Unfortunately, I lost on

01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:28.940
the second level. Damn it! Well, at least you got to the second level. Which is going

01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:34.580
It's going to be one of my FUs of the week tonight.

01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:37.680
How bad did you lose?

01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:41.380
I don't know how tournament poker works, but I guess how many people do you play against

01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:43.540
at a time in tournament poker?

01:22:43.540 --> 01:22:47.860
There were 240 tables and there were 9 players.

01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:49.660
Just multiply that by 9.

01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:52.220
Oh my gosh.

01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:53.660
But you won?

01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:57.860
You beat, you won out of 9 people in the first round, right?

01:22:57.860 --> 01:23:00.860
Well, yeah. I already won over two tables.

01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:03.860
Oh, eh. That's not bad.

01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:06.860
But unfortunately I lost to a professional poker player.

01:23:06.860 --> 01:23:08.860
Oh, well that always kind of sucks.

01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:13.860
But, so you got up there a little bit then. That's still pretty cool. Good job.

01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:15.860
Maybe next year, maybe next year.

01:23:15.860 --> 01:23:19.860
Yeah, maybe next year, because there goes my $1,000 buy-in.

01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:22.860
What? Oh my god, it was $1,000 to buy-in?

01:23:22.860 --> 01:23:24.860
Yeah.

01:23:24.860 --> 01:23:26.860
Oh my god, you didn't get any of it back.

01:23:26.860 --> 01:23:33.820
well no a thousand dollars for a freaking poker here's the thing here's

01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:39.540
the thing the top prize is seven hundred and twenty-five thousand Wow and with

01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:43.100
it and then there's going to be a another no-limit tournament this Friday

01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:48.040
which is going to be a $2,000 buy-in and you know it's going to be twice twice

01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:52.580
enough for the top prize Wow that's pretty hard but can you imagine a DDR

01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:57.980
tournament with a thousand dollar buy-in? At least you could have the DDR tournament

01:23:57.980 --> 01:24:02.660
that has a harder run than that one. That's like, just under half of my monthly

01:24:02.660 --> 01:24:08.820
salary. That's messed up. Well, what do you expect? It's Vegas, right?

01:24:08.820 --> 01:24:11.920
Yeah. Alright. What do you have to say to the people

01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:14.660
that are criticizing you for putting up a thousand dollars of your money?

01:24:14.660 --> 01:24:20.840
Well, it's just, you know, I've already planned this for months now.

01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:25.240
everybody has their thing

01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:28.160
you're allowed to spend money on post some people some people invest their

01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:29.040
money in there

01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:32.320
video game collections that are anime collection so you have the right to

01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:35.040
spend your money on a poker tournament if you want right

01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:38.640

david williams john yugostino demand and break that one

01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:18.540
but i would think

01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:23.980
i would think these guys hang out in vegas an awful lot

01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:25.780
yeah you know uh...

01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:27.760

01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:38.780
but you know

01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:49.780
I wasn't, I was tired. You know, before I headed to Rio, I went to Circus Circus, you know, for some 2GX Red action, just to calm my nerves down.

01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:57.780
I swear I'm going to come out to Vegas soon. If my leisure trip to the East Coast ends up getting cancelled, I think I'm going to come to Vegas.

01:26:57.780 --> 01:27:05.780
Because I got money to burn, so. And I want to come play games at Circus Circus. Because you know Circus Circus was where I originally played DDR for the first time.

01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:06.780
Yeah.

01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:07.780
I have a lot of love.

All right, well, Siggy, we're going to let you go so we can take some of the calls, but

01:27:11.340 --> 01:27:16.460
good luck practicing the poker, and I hope you can get at that final table next year,

01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:17.460
all right?

01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:18.460
All right.

01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:19.460
All right.

01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:20.460
Good luck.

You're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:27.460
Hey.

01:27:27.460 --> 01:27:28.460
What's up?

01:27:28.460 --> 01:27:29.460
It's the one and only Ronma.

01:27:29.460 --> 01:27:30.460
Hello, Ronma.

01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:31.460
How are you, buddy?

01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:32.460
Hi, Uchon.

01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:33.460
Hi, Uchon.

01:27:33.460 --> 01:27:37.460
Warning! Cute factor approaching. Cute factor approaching.

01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:39.460
What's on your mind, my friend?

01:27:39.460 --> 01:27:45.460
Eh, not much. I just had a real twisted weekend. I was forced to quit my job.

01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:47.460
You were forced to quit your job?

01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:48.460
Yep.

01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:54.460
Did somebody catch you in the storeroom with a lady, you know, something like that going on, or what?

01:27:54.460 --> 01:27:58.460
No, I actually caught somebody else violating corporate policy.

01:27:58.460 --> 01:28:00.460
Okay, how's that work? You gotta explain this one to me.

01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:07.340
Okay on geek squad you guys sell services one of the technicians was selling services, but he was pocketing the money. Oh

01:28:08.940 --> 01:28:11.020
So, how does that mean you lose your job?

01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:18.860
I'm still trying more or less like they were I found that they were like tracking me and following me around

01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:22.500
It seems that before I went to an amazement

01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:27.260
I told my general manager what was going on got a customer to make a statement on what happened

01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:33.260
I made my statement. Go away. I come back. Oh, I come to find out that one of the managers wants to talk to me.

01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:40.260
It seems that I'm being accused of losing money in the department and I have an issue with not coming to work.

01:28:40.260 --> 01:28:42.260
Huh.

01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:44.260
You don't get it.

01:28:44.260 --> 01:28:49.260
Was this person who was selling stuff under the table like the boss's nephew or something?

01:28:49.260 --> 01:28:54.260
No, but ever since he found out I knew something about it, he's been, he's had an issue with me.

01:28:54.260 --> 01:29:05.260
I still say you need to nail their asses to the wall.

01:29:05.260 --> 01:29:06.260
Oh, I am.

01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:11.260
DarkStakra is a great- she can give you some good advice on where to go if you want to kick some butt.

01:29:11.260 --> 01:29:13.260
Oh, I plan on it.

01:29:13.260 --> 01:29:17.260
Keep us posted on how that goes. How's your gaming week been?

01:29:17.260 --> 01:29:22.260
Pretty good, pretty good. I got a controller so now I've been playing PSO a little bit more than I should be.

01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:23.260
Blue Burst?

01:29:23.260 --> 01:29:24.260
Yes.

01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:27.260
Now, DarkSakurai, you had a fun time in Blue Burst tonight, didn't you?

01:29:27.260 --> 01:29:28.260
Yes, you need to play with me.

01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:31.260
I'm actually going to be starting an Orange Lounge radio team.

01:29:31.260 --> 01:29:33.260
Okay, are you playing tonight?

01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:34.260
Um, I can.

01:29:34.260 --> 01:29:35.260
Okay.

01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:40.260
Only listeners are allowed to come into this room.

01:29:40.260 --> 01:29:45.260
I always play on Hyperion 7, and the room is MurdockIs?

01:29:45.260 --> 01:29:48.260
And the password is God, with a capital G.

01:29:48.260 --> 01:29:49.260
Alright.

01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:54.260
Since I have the memory retention of a goldfish, I will be asking this a little bit later.

01:29:54.260 --> 01:29:58.260
That's fine. We'll try and post a reminder in the chat room towards the end of the show on PSO.

01:29:58.260 --> 01:29:59.260
Awesome.

01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:00.260
All right.

01:30:00.260 --> 01:30:01.260

Well, have fun with that. Anything else you want to share with us?

01:30:02.260 --> 01:30:09.260
Oh, and remember I called a few weeks back and I told you about the slash pizza icon I saw at Ama Boston?

01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:10.260
Yes.

01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:13.260
I sent Dark Sakura the picture so you could take a look at it.

01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:16.260
Dark Sakura, do you have those pictures? You have to share those.

01:30:16.260 --> 01:30:17.260
You emailed those, right?

01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:18.260

01:32:13.220 --> 01:32:15.660
video game convention in virginia

01:32:15.660 --> 01:32:17.260
local what's happening

01:32:17.260 --> 01:32:20.820
uh... it's actually coming up we're skipping this year it's going to be in

01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:22.100
january

01:32:22.100 --> 01:32:22.940
okay

01:32:22.940 --> 01:32:27.540
the uh... i think it's the weekend right before of ohio con i think

01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:30.500
so what you've got to do you get distributors to come out there and show

01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:34.540
off the games everything or what but i had this will actually be our fourth

01:32:34.540 --> 01:32:37.140
year that we've been doing the convention uh...

01:32:37.140 --> 01:32:38.300
first-year

01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:42.160
was pretty good we had uh... enemy premier of ease

01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:44.240
we had the first

01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:48.460
turbo graphics sixteen ever made on display i love you

01:32:48.460 --> 01:32:52.320
it actually had serial number zero zero zero zero zero one

01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:54.740
i i i want act

01:32:54.740 --> 01:32:55.680
mind please

01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:57.060
that's pretty hot

01:32:57.060 --> 01:33:02.140
i love the pc engine i thought seeing the last dreamcast ever made it was

01:33:02.140 --> 01:33:03.020
pretty hot

01:33:03.020 --> 01:33:04.780
but the first river graphics

01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:06.100
that's pretty hot as well

01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:10.740
yeah they had it in a little glass case and everything and it went like the con chairman

01:33:10.740 --> 01:33:14.340
said yeah you'll find me curled up in a ditch in mexico with them

01:33:14.340 --> 01:33:17.120
it kinda sounds like what you've got going on is like

01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:20.020
similar to classic gaming expo

01:33:20.020 --> 01:33:21.140
but uh... uh...

01:33:21.140 --> 01:33:25.320
kinda yeah but more emphasis put on the fandom kinda like anime

01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:28.380
conventions are this one's for video games only

01:33:28.380 --> 01:33:31.160
oh god do you have cosplayers

01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:35.720
uh... last convention we had three and they got really pissy because we had a

01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:43.720
cosplay at two in the morning. There was like a really good like, Kosmos, but she

01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:48.800
like, obviously for an anime convention, her mentality was definitely not the

01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:54.040
right one for this convention. You can't have a convention, you can't have a geek

01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:58.720
convention happen without some rejected Ricky Lake guest doing Sailor Moon

01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:03.440
cosplay. Thankfully we didn't have any Sailor Moons or anything, it was all

01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:12.440
We had all video game characters. We had like a Sid from Final Fantasy IV, and that was really cool when Genova Project played live.

01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:16.440
He almost climbed up on stage while they were doing Final Fantasy IV Boss.

01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:22.440
For those that don't know, Genova Project is the band that was before many bosses.

01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:24.440
We actually had them play live, too.

01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:29.440
Wow, sounds like you guys have a good time out there. I wish we were on the East Coast so we could check it out,

01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:39.440
But maybe in January we'll have money in the travel budget, so keep looking at the change that falls in the sofa, because that's the travel budget.

01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:43.440
You wouldn't be the only ones to be coming from California. We had about 50 people come from California.

01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:46.440
That's nice. That's nice. Good deal.

01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:52.440
Dude, if I was to go there, I would cosplay as King Hippo from Mike Tyson's Pink Out.

01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:55.440
Dude, one of the most underrated 8-bit characters.

01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:57.200
eggplantwizard

01:34:57.200 --> 01:34:59.900
we need eggplantwizard cosplay

01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:03.440
i actually want to cosplay as one of the guys from Russian Attack

01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:05.320
oh Akarnov dude

01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:08.240
are you a bad enough dude to save the president?

01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:12.680
let's get a cheeseburger

01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:16.840
we need a bunch of people to do a super dodgeball cosplay

01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:18.920
i've actually seen people do it

01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:23.800
or the kunio kun hot blooded downtown story also known as river city ransom

01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:31.800
At NekoCon, there was actually a group of five people that cosplayed as the frat guys from RCR.

01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:35.800
Wow. Did they say barf when they hit the floor and everything?

01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:38.800
Actually, they did. They did. It was really cool.

01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:40.800
That's awesome.

01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:47.800
They only did it because X-Strike Studios was showing RCR at River City Rumble at NekoCon, which is really cool.

01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:54.800
Wow. Actually, I have one more idea, and that's to dress up as Leisure Suit Larry, the original OG.

01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:55.800
Wow.

01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:57.800
Yeah, give Spanish Fly to the secretary.

01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:00.800
So, how much floor space does this con take up?

01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:03.800
We take up the entire hotel.

01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:05.800
Oh, that's nice. That sounds like fun.

01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:07.800
24-hour game room.

01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:13.800
Land room is actually going to be split into four rooms, because last year I actually got it up to about 68 people.

01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:18.200
Wow well you know if our podcast takes off and you know we're able to sell out

01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:21.960
to the man and we get a travel budget we are so there. We'll check it out.

01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:28.400
Travel budget rock on. Yeah right now it's about five cents. So you can get down

01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:33.960
the block basically. Actually my other idea is to establish a swear jar because

01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:39.960
that shit would fill up fast. That would. We'd be dropping 20's in a night. We'd be going to Hawaii every month.

01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:42.960
Alright. Anything else you want to share with us?

01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:46.960
Um, probably just pimping for X-Strike.

01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:49.960
X-Strike Studios is going to be at AMA coming up in two weeks.

01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:56.960
They're going to be premiering Silent Horror, a video game movie that doesn't suck based on Silent Hill.

01:36:56.960 --> 01:37:01.960
Wait a minute, so it's like an actual movie that's going to be released in the studios?

01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:02.960
I kind of saw this already.

01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:03.960
What is this?

01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:04.960
The trailer for it.

01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:07.960
The trailer actually does no justice.

01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:11.080
Okay, because the trailer kind of sucked.

01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:15.160
Actually, the trailer does suck. I was like, wow, this makes Ui Bol look good.

01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:19.160
It's actually like, it's both funny as hell,

01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:23.400
because they make fun of every like horror genre at the same time,

01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:28.120
but it also is scary at parts. We've had people like think,

01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:32.920
oh man, did you actually chop somebody's head in that shot? And they're like, no.

01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:37.360
Well hey, you know the movie Scream was the same idea where it had like the humor and the

01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:40.840
actual scary stuff mixed in, and from what I hear, that movie did pretty good.

01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:41.840
So you never know.

01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:45.960
And a movie that has a line saying, that's like, what are you doing with all that crap?

01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:50.440
Well you never know when you're going to need an empty lighter fluid can to fill up a lighter

01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:54.600
or a freakishly large statue to press the switch.

01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:56.880
It's good to have a well stocked inventory.

01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:58.160
Do they have a distributor for it?

01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:01.480
Are they still trying to find something?

01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:04.800
It's actually, they're sending it off to the DVD pressers.

01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:10.620
They're going with a different DVD press and company that they did for River City Rumble.

01:38:10.620 --> 01:38:13.860
So it should be for sale at AMA.

01:38:13.860 --> 01:38:16.000
It's actually going to kind of premiere at AMA.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Very cool.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:22.320
Two commentaries, an outtake track, deleted scenes, director's commentary.

01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:23.320
It's a fully loaded DVD.

01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:25.060
Well, good luck to those guys.

01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:28.980
I love B-movies with inside jokes, so that sounds like fun.

01:38:28.980 --> 01:38:29.980
So it's a bunch of gamer nerds-

01:38:29.980 --> 01:38:32.280
And be sure to watch the Transformer reference.

01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:33.960
It's a bunch of gamer nerds that did this?

01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:35.960
Oh absolutely. It'll be great. It'll be great.

01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:39.960
It's x-strikestudios.com.

01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:41.960
x-strikestudios.com. Sounds good.

01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:43.960
Well thank you for calling us and I hope you have a good one.

01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:44.960
No problem.

01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:45.960
Have fun at your con.

01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:46.960
I need more beer.

01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:47.960
Seven months. Alright, have...

01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:49.960
Hey, have another bud for us, alright?

01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:51.960
Oh, it's Killian's tonight.

01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:54.960
Sounds good. Actually, have a Guinness. Have a Guinness for us, because that's...

01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:55.960
The Guinness is really beer.

01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:56.960
I wish I had some.

01:38:56.960 --> 01:38:57.960
Alright.

01:38:57.960 --> 01:38:58.960
Good stuff. Alright, have a good one, buddy.

01:38:58.960 --> 01:38:59.960
Alright, bye.

01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:00.960
Later.

01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:04.800
getting his name from the rez trans vibrator. That's awesome.

01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:10.800
Teramisu, um, god, um, what is it, uh, the, what is that, that liqueur in it.

01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:17.800
It has booze, I must have some. Okay, we're gonna get some teramisu as we get into cage match here because

01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:23.800
Coffee liqueur. I don't really like teramisu usually though, but I'm, is it off, is it, uh, Olive Garden teramisu?

01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:29.800
No, it's teramisu from Ellie's. Hmm. I will have a small corner because I've eaten, like, most people eat all day.

01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:33.000
I'll give it a try. I will give it a try. I have eaten mostly meat today.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:39.800
Alright. Of course if I take this piece home and spread it out over the week, I can get away with it.

01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:44.800
Alright, let's get into tonight's cage match, Poison Girls.

01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:52.800
Last week in the Orange Lounge cage match, the Gorillaz were entered in and they won in a narrow victory

01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:58.800
with their song, Dare, which is kind of a dance-y song which you don't hear from Gorillaz very often, but it's fun.

01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:00.320
Happy Monday song.

01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:02.640
It's very happy, but Mondays aren't happy,

01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:03.680
so I don't know what that's all about.

01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:05.080
All right.

01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:06.360
Anyway, the way the cage match works,

01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:10.080
you must be in our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:12.280
We will play three songs for you.

01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:14.000
Last week's winner, just a clip,

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.480
because you already heard it last week,

01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:18.000
and two new songs in their entirety.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:21.000
And the winning song goes into rotation all week long

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:24.480
on Orange Lounge Radio's video game music program,

01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:26.520
which plays 24 hours a day, seven days a week

01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:29.280
on this station when we aren't live.

01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:32.200
And what is the criteria for these songs

01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:34.440
to be in the cage match?

01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:35.920
They have to kick ass.

01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:37.080
We just have to like them.

01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:38.040
That's the only criteria.

01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:40.000
They don't have to be related to games at all.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:43.080
It's just cool stuff we think you should hear.

01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:44.880
So here it is, a clip of last week's winner.

01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:45.840
Song number one.

01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:47.480
Is it worthy of a two-week victory?

01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:48.240
You be the judge.

01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:49.720
Gorillas dare.

01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:54.720
I'm still alive

01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:00.720
Never did know I'm

01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:02.720
Never did know I'm

01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:07.720
Each day

01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:09.720
It's coming up, it's coming up

01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:11.720
It's coming up, it's coming up

01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:12.720
It's coming up

01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:14.720
It's dead

01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:23.720
It's dead

01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:34.720
You've got depression on you

01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:40.720
You just thinkin' that's what you do, baby

01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:44.720
Hold it down, yeah

01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:49.720
Just feel the moment

01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:52.720
Jump back and forth

01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:56.720
Feel like you were banging down

01:41:56.720 --> 01:41:59.720
Working out

01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:04.720
Never did no harm

01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:06.720
Never did no harm

01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:49.720
All right, that was a clip of song number one, Dare, by the Gorillaz.

01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:53.280
Okay, let's get into a new song, which will play in its entirety.

01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:55.000
This one's six minutes.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:56.000
This better be good, Loki.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
What do you got for us?

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.360
Well, it's not a girls remix.

01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:01.360
Sorry.

01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:02.360
Oh, sorry.

01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:04.440
Let's see, now Girls Butts is okay.

01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:05.440
Girls by Prodigy?

01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:12.440
okay. Now, this is something I didn't really have much to bring this week, so I was going

01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:18.540
through some of my old CDs that have been ripping into my hard drive, and I found one

01:43:18.540 --> 01:43:23.920
on the verse 1 and 2, which it hid from me. And this is a remix, and I don't even remember

01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:29.960
the title of it, because it's really strange. And it's a remix of basically Tac stuff, and

01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:34.980
you've got it says it's mainly the XY but they threw in holic stuff in there

01:43:34.980 --> 01:43:41.380
as well I think I've heard this before it's direct C D Re X I Y I'm calling it

01:43:41.380 --> 01:43:46.940
direct C which sounds like an eating disorder to me but whatever I don't know

01:43:46.940 --> 01:43:52.660
all right it's pretty cool I mean I was trying to find a short song is this the

01:43:52.660 --> 01:43:57.440
artist is the artist name really VA on this no that's just very art various

01:43:57.440 --> 01:44:02.660
artists cuz it's on diverse systems I can look it up but I mean it take me a

01:44:02.660 --> 01:44:08.740
sec but yeah basically I mean it should be enjoyable you'll just say it's by

01:44:08.740 --> 01:44:12.060
diverse systems so this is diverse systems if you like Taku you should like

01:44:12.060 --> 01:44:16.820
this all right here it is song number two in tonight's cage match direct see

01:44:16.820 --> 01:44:18.820
Enjoy!

01:50:16.820 --> 01:50:19.320
Alright, there was song number two tonight, Durexi.

01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:24.320
Uh, is that, uh, Durexi good or Durexi bad? Let's find out. Dark Sakura.

01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:29.820
I like lots of parts of it, and you know me, I love Taku.

01:50:29.820 --> 01:50:34.320
But, there were parts that just sort of, kind of dragged on like that part at the end.

01:50:34.820 --> 01:50:35.820
Um...

01:50:38.820 --> 01:50:39.820
Seven.

01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:42.820
Solid, but kind of dragged a bit.

01:50:42.820 --> 01:50:48.820
My vote. Whatever. I give it a six for the number of minutes.

01:50:48.820 --> 01:50:49.820
Loki.

01:50:49.820 --> 01:50:51.820
Next time I'm picking a ten minute song.

01:50:51.820 --> 01:50:56.820
Oh, but I give the tiramisu a ten, by the way, because it tasted like liquor, and that makes me happy.

01:50:56.820 --> 01:51:01.820
I vote as a good song just because it reminded me a lot of the Legend of Attack song that I did a long time ago.

01:51:01.820 --> 01:51:09.820
Which I kind of do something else, because originally that Legend of Attack song was supposed to be every single Attack song in one mix.

01:51:09.820 --> 01:51:12.820
But, uh, I stopped before I finished.

01:51:12.820 --> 01:51:16.820
Anyway, um, no, I give it like a 8, because it's good.

01:51:16.820 --> 01:51:19.820
Islander.

01:51:19.820 --> 01:51:25.820
I'd probably give it about a 6-2, but then, because my reasoning is, it was, it...

01:51:25.820 --> 01:51:27.820
I, too, Phil, it was a little too long.

01:51:27.820 --> 01:51:29.820
Could've done without a few things.

01:51:29.820 --> 01:51:31.820
Alrighty.

01:51:31.820 --> 01:51:36.820
Let's go on to song number 3. Song number 3, somebody sent me the music video for this during the week,

01:51:36.820 --> 01:51:41.900
week and it reminded me about how funny this song is so and I love the video

01:51:41.900 --> 01:51:47.700
it's so funny so um and it's actually a pretty decent dance song so I chose this

01:51:47.700 --> 01:51:51.900
song it's kind of like I wouldn't say it's a remake of an 80s classic but it

01:51:51.900 --> 01:51:57.660
invokes an 80s classic so this is Eric pride and the song is called call on me

01:51:57.660 --> 01:51:59.660
Enjoy!

01:54:27.660 --> 01:54:56.100
Song number three, Eric Prides, Call On Me, will you guys be calling that song back or

01:54:56.100 --> 01:54:58.800
or will you conveniently lose its number? Dark Sakura.

01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:03.380
I love the original, but that one was also really repetitive. It has some...

01:55:03.380 --> 01:55:06.820
It would be good for DDR, I think, if it were cut down to a minute and a half,

01:55:06.820 --> 01:55:08.500
but it was just

01:55:08.500 --> 01:55:11.340
too repetitive. It gets a six-and-a-half.

01:55:11.340 --> 01:55:12.380
Loki.

01:55:12.380 --> 01:55:14.900
The club song's supposed to be repetitive. Actually, it's...

01:55:14.900 --> 01:55:19.720
For me, it has the same elements of a Daft Punk song, where it's simple, it can be

01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:22.300
repetitive, but it's still catchy,

01:55:22.300 --> 01:55:26.540
and it doesn't get really annoying, and that's what's cool about Daft Punk, and I think there

01:55:26.540 --> 01:55:30.860
may be even some Fat Boy Slim songs like that and stuff, but it's just, it's one of the

01:55:30.860 --> 01:55:36.220
songs that lends itself to a club scene very well, so get to nine, it's good.

01:55:36.220 --> 01:55:41.260
Sometimes I wish we were a TV show, because honestly, that song isn't done justice without

01:55:41.260 --> 01:55:46.820
the video. Yes, isn't the, I remember the... The video is all these, it's women working

01:55:46.820 --> 01:55:51.540
out, and like, they're wearing like Jane Fonda style attire, it's like full-on 80s, but here's

01:55:51.540 --> 01:55:57.540
Here's the thing. Consistent tits and ass shots. Consistently through the video.

01:55:57.540 --> 01:56:00.540
I remember the video for this and that was hilarious.

01:56:00.540 --> 01:56:05.540
And then there's just some random guy there too that's just working out. It's funny. I don't know.

01:56:05.540 --> 01:56:10.540
I laughed. Okay, I'm gay and I thought it was funny, but maybe it's the whole boobies thing. I don't know.

01:56:10.540 --> 01:56:12.540
Because they say gay men are infatuated with boobies.

01:56:12.540 --> 01:56:16.540
Islander, who is not a gay man, but is still infatuated with boobies.

01:56:16.540 --> 01:56:19.540
Oh, absolutely.

01:56:19.540 --> 01:56:41.540
But no, I sort of agree there with Loki's comments how it does lend itself to the club scene, it's in that mold of Daft Punk and whatnot, and if you don't mind hearing that type of music, I for one don't. I would bump that in my car. I'd give that probably an 8.

01:56:41.540 --> 01:56:44.540
Alright, and eight for eighties. How's that?

01:56:44.540 --> 01:56:49.540
Absolutely. Let's see. Okay, so, um, pretty diverse selection here tonight in the cage match.

01:56:49.540 --> 01:56:53.540
Remember, our votes don't count for shit. It's all up to you guys in the chat room.

01:56:53.540 --> 01:56:58.540
So here it is, the three songs you can vote for tonight, starting it off with song number one,

01:56:58.540 --> 01:57:15.260
last week's winner going for win number two Gorillaz Dare and song number two you

01:57:15.260 --> 01:57:29.020
can vote for tonight, Diverse System with Durexi.

01:57:29.020 --> 01:57:36.340
And song number three can vote for tonight, Eric Pride's Call On Me.

01:57:36.340 --> 01:57:47.700
Alright, place vote now, send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote, and

01:57:47.700 --> 01:57:51.820
if you don't know how to do that, hold on, I'll tell you guys in our chat room how to

01:57:51.820 --> 01:57:53.620
momentarily.

01:57:53.620 --> 01:57:55.060
You guys have about three minutes.

01:57:55.060 --> 01:57:59.900
Loki, this is the part of the show where I tell, I let you explain what's going on in

01:57:59.900 --> 01:58:00.900
the sim world.

01:58:00.900 --> 01:58:04.000
Well, I explained a little bit what's going on in the sim world, like for example, there

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:10.480
It's a sim file for my song Legend of the Trance 2005, which you can find on by myself.

01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:14.640
There's a few other things that happened as far as releases go.

01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:24.320
There was DDRXXMix, and I know that's a weird name, but it's Japanese, so what can we say?

01:58:24.320 --> 01:58:30.800
They released version 2.5, which has some more songs in it, and it's actually a good

01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:35.480
80 meg downloads, so you can go check that out as well.

01:58:35.480 --> 01:58:39.560
Then there's also another one.

01:58:39.560 --> 01:58:42.760
It's actually kind of an older one that came out around this

01:58:42.760 --> 01:58:44.720
time food mix one came out.

01:58:44.720 --> 01:58:51.240
And it's party night.

01:58:51.240 --> 01:58:54.000
Dance Dance Revolution, I guess, party night edition or

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:55.360
something like that.

01:58:55.360 --> 01:58:58.200
They're calling it DDR party night mix

01:58:58.200 --> 01:59:00.200
appendix series number one.

01:59:00.200 --> 01:59:06.740
that's kind of a tongue twister but basically what that is is a good

01:59:06.740 --> 01:59:14.140
download for you that's about oh I don't know it's it's pretty big 216 megs so

01:59:14.140 --> 01:59:19.540
that's quite quite quite the download there so go check that out now granted

01:59:19.540 --> 01:59:25.780
the first party night mix was not very good but um definitely recommend oh I'm

01:59:25.780 --> 01:59:29.780
I'm sorry, not XX Mixes, DDR D3 Mix 2.5.

01:59:29.780 --> 01:59:30.980
And check that out.

01:59:30.980 --> 01:59:34.280
That's going to be pretty good as well, because I actually

01:59:34.280 --> 01:59:35.320
played some of that stuff.

01:59:35.320 --> 01:59:36.580
And it's pretty cool.

01:59:36.580 --> 01:59:40.020
And then if you want, there's a whole thread on Bamaiso.

01:59:40.020 --> 01:59:44.140
You can check out the brand new Japanese little fan mixes

01:59:44.140 --> 01:59:45.580
that are being released.

01:59:45.580 --> 01:59:50.180
And definitely watch that closely, because we're still

01:59:50.180 --> 01:59:51.980
waiting, Food Mix 2.

01:59:51.980 --> 01:59:55.540
And when that comes out, it's going to be pretty awesome.

01:59:55.540 --> 01:59:57.940
But remember last week, the manhole.

01:59:57.940 --> 02:00:00.580
Find it on, they have a song called Manhole.

02:00:04.420 --> 02:00:05.220
Yeah, that's right.

02:00:05.220 --> 02:00:07.620
We do have the maturity level of preschool.

02:00:07.620 --> 02:00:11.380
Anyways, yeah, that's pretty much what's going on in the

02:00:11.380 --> 02:00:12.700
sim scene right now.

02:00:12.700 --> 02:00:14.020
So check those out.

02:00:14.020 --> 02:00:18.660
And watch Bahmani Style's sim file database, because every

02:00:18.660 --> 02:00:20.300
now and then there will be a good one.

02:00:20.300 --> 02:00:23.220
But in the meantime, you'll have to deal with Paranoia

02:00:23.220 --> 02:00:29.180
Twist, Omega, and Max Evo.

02:00:29.180 --> 02:00:31.460
Enjoy.

02:00:31.460 --> 02:00:33.780
Goody, goody.

02:00:33.780 --> 02:00:35.860
Just a reminder, you boys and girls out there, we have a

02:00:35.860 --> 02:00:39.180
podcast where we talk about other games.

02:00:39.180 --> 02:00:41.500
We talk about games that don't suck and the news you really

02:00:41.500 --> 02:00:42.820
want to know about.

02:00:42.820 --> 02:00:44.180
That's available on our website,

02:00:44.180 --> 02:00:46.780
www.orangeloungeradio.com.

02:00:46.780 --> 02:00:49.820
Just click on the Orange Lounge Radio to Go edition,

02:00:49.820 --> 02:00:51.620
which is over on the left-hand side.

02:00:51.620 --> 02:00:53.580
And you can download that.

02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:55.940
And actually, that show's been very successful for us, so

02:00:55.940 --> 02:00:58.340
we're pretty happy about that.

02:00:58.340 --> 02:01:00.820
Also, if you have a chance, give us a vote over on

02:01:00.820 --> 02:01:03.180
Podcast Alley, because we like attention.

02:01:03.180 --> 02:01:05.300
Even though that site is turning into one big

02:01:05.300 --> 02:01:07.660
popularity contest, hey.

02:01:07.660 --> 02:01:08.740
We like popularity.

02:01:08.740 --> 02:01:09.940
We like being popular.

02:01:09.940 --> 02:01:11.220
Doesn't everyone?

02:01:11.220 --> 02:01:12.740
So give us a vote over there.

02:01:12.740 --> 02:01:14.620
I'll paste a link in the chat room for you guys who want to

02:01:14.620 --> 02:01:14.820
do that.

02:01:14.820 --> 02:01:16.420
Oh, I completely forgot to mention earlier

02:01:16.420 --> 02:01:18.260
during my week stuff.

02:01:18.260 --> 02:01:20.740
There was actually something.

02:01:20.740 --> 02:01:25.380
it's not like huge but it is rather significant to happen this week

02:01:25.380 --> 02:01:27.920
uh...

02:01:27.920 --> 02:01:31.780
i may have made fun of the song earlier this week or not really this week but

02:01:31.780 --> 02:01:35.160
when we were talking about karaoke Revolution 4 but uh...

02:01:35.160 --> 02:01:37.340
Patrick Swayze came to my work

02:01:37.340 --> 02:01:39.340
how many people can say that

02:01:39.340 --> 02:01:43.660
Patrick Swayze came to my work as well as his wife it was on Channel 3 News

02:01:43.660 --> 02:01:45.460
local here in Sacramento

02:01:45.460 --> 02:01:49.780
and uh... he was basically promoting his new movie that's going to be coming out called Last Dance

02:01:49.780 --> 02:01:55.060
which is about his, I guess, you know, he started off classically trained as, you know, ballet, so...

02:01:55.060 --> 02:01:56.740
That was a Donna Summer song.

02:01:56.740 --> 02:02:00.380
Anyways, um, The Last Dance, it's gonna be coming out, um...

02:02:00.380 --> 02:02:03.980
Last dance. Last dance. Oh, sorry.

02:02:03.980 --> 02:02:11.740
Anyways, so yeah, he's, yeah, I got an autograph, um, and scene from his wife, who actually directed and, uh, wrote the movie.

02:02:11.740 --> 02:02:19.100
And, uh, he actually flew in on his plane, um, into the Karen Park Airport nearby here, so he's a pilot and all this stuff.

02:02:19.100 --> 02:02:32.600
Quite interesting. Really funny guy, too. So, I had a picture with him. Unfortunately, my friend's camera broke. So, no picture with him, unfortunately. But, um, yeah. So another celebrity sighting at my work.

02:02:32.600 --> 02:02:45.100
You know, I realize they did a sequel to Dirty Dancing. But overlooking that piece of crap, they should do, like, a new sequel to Dirty Dancing with Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey.

02:02:45.100 --> 02:02:46.100
He- he- honestly-

02:02:46.100 --> 02:02:48.600
But they need to give her back her, like, old nose.

02:02:48.600 --> 02:03:00.600
He's doing a movie right now because this whole movie is supposed to be about going inside the mind of a dancer, like what they're experiencing. So it's kind of a surreal movie in a sense.

02:03:00.600 --> 02:03:14.600
But it's kind of going in the mind of a dancer. So he says a couple movies like this, or if he's going to be able to do a couple movies, because he says you've got to be in incredible shape to be able to do this kind of ballet.

02:03:14.600 --> 02:03:16.360
But Dirty Dancing, man, I can do that until I die.

02:03:16.360 --> 02:03:20.720
So maybe, you know, there'll be another Dirty Dancing movie.

02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:22.680
I know he's got a few other movies coming out,

02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:23.720
though, right now, but.

02:03:23.720 --> 02:03:27.680
Dude, they could combine the Dirty Dancing sequel

02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:30.360
with the DDR Freak movie.

02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:33.760
Because you know how that always comes up?

02:03:33.760 --> 02:03:35.200
It's dancy dancing!

02:03:35.200 --> 02:03:37.840
OMG to DDR Freak movie?

02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:40.760
That's what it could be, is it could be Patrick Swayze

02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:45.040
Jennifer Grey, like, reunited to win to dinner competition.

02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:51.560
That is ridiculous.

02:03:51.560 --> 02:03:56.720
And then, like, they can get to the competition, and now, for the final challenge, where you

02:03:56.720 --> 02:04:02.880
You will have to face Dark, Patrick Swayze.

02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:07.800
Dark Swayze!

02:04:07.800 --> 02:04:13.920
Use the force.

02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:20.920
Use the bar, Luke.

02:04:22.600 --> 02:04:25.440
I can't do this.

02:04:25.440 --> 02:04:29.240
All right, let's find out who won tonight's cage match, shall we?

02:04:29.240 --> 02:04:30.000
Yes, please.

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:30.760
All right.

02:04:30.760 --> 02:04:36.040
Tonight's cage match, boys and girls, it is a tie.

02:04:36.040 --> 02:04:37.200
It's a tie in tonight's cage.

02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:38.120
Yes, it's a tie.

02:04:38.120 --> 02:04:39.120
What?

02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:40.480
All right, here it is.

02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:41.240
Two songs tied.

02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:42.840
I'm going to remind you guys what happens in a tie,

02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:45.000
but let's first find out the two songs that tied.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:51.400
Song number one that tied tonight, Direct C.

02:04:51.400 --> 02:04:52.440
All six minutes of it.

02:04:52.440 --> 02:04:55.080
And song number two that tied in tonight's cage match

02:04:55.080 --> 02:05:06.840
was Gorillaz with Dare. Now, the rules of a tie say that the host who put in the song

02:05:06.840 --> 02:05:13.940
that did not end up in the tie gets to break the tie. That's me! So I get to break the

02:05:13.940 --> 02:05:20.940
tie tonight because you bastards didn't vote for call on me. So, um, who loves me more?

02:05:20.940 --> 02:05:22.740
I buy you food sometimes.

02:05:22.740 --> 02:05:27.180
I brought you cake. That's true, you did bring me tiramisu.

02:05:27.180 --> 02:05:29.380
I brought you liquor. Uh, that's true, but um...

02:05:29.380 --> 02:05:35.380
you know, Direxie just went on for way too long, so I have to give it to Dare tonight.

02:05:35.380 --> 02:05:38.300
But Dare's gone on for two weeks already.

02:05:38.300 --> 02:05:40.100
Too late, I've made up my mind.

02:05:40.100 --> 02:05:45.540
It has the mighty power of Sean Ryder and Damon.

02:05:45.540 --> 02:05:49.140
Oh, we got a weird buzzy sound on here.

02:05:49.140 --> 02:05:51.660
um... so there is

02:05:51.660 --> 02:05:52.680
uh...

02:05:52.680 --> 02:05:56.540
something weak win number two for dare so we'll be back next week to see if it

02:05:56.540 --> 02:06:00.500
can go for dare to stay off drugs

02:06:00.500 --> 02:06:03.940
did they have a report on people singing that song to be saying that about you

02:06:03.940 --> 02:06:07.120
want to know okay you want to know what a geek i was in elementary school think

02:06:07.120 --> 02:06:11.780
back to the what what what year would this been like eighty nine

02:06:11.780 --> 02:06:14.420
we had the dare program in schools i don't know if this is a nationwide

02:06:14.420 --> 02:06:17.780
thing or just california but dare was the drug

02:06:17.780 --> 02:06:21.760
abuse resistance education i think is what it's about like that anti-drug

02:06:21.760 --> 02:06:25.000
program but they say that it was an utter failure because what it ended up

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:28.560
doing is actually talk it about all the drugs that was out there

02:06:28.560 --> 02:06:32.160
dot that's what they need to be funny exactly

02:06:32.160 --> 02:06:37.860
that and that i mean you know it does that we are a nationwide thing

02:06:37.860 --> 02:06:41.240
i might go my own well my ex-fiance in colorado

02:06:41.240 --> 02:06:44.000
she was a dear graduate twice

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:52.000
Still ended up, still ended up smoking, shooting up anything she can get her hands on.

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:53.000
Wow.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:54.000
I don't know.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:57.880
I'm going to go get me some drugs now.

02:06:57.880 --> 02:07:03.040
Everybody in the chat room knows what I'm talking about, so they're all saying yes,

02:07:03.040 --> 02:07:04.040
it's nationwide.

02:07:04.040 --> 02:07:05.040
So cool.

02:07:05.040 --> 02:07:07.840
For our international audience, sorry, you're just screwed.

02:07:07.840 --> 02:07:09.140
But here's the thing.

02:07:09.140 --> 02:07:12.840
I don't know why I remember this, but I remember they had a little workbook that had all these

02:07:12.840 --> 02:07:17.560
exercises on it. You're supposed to identify different drugs. One of them was create your

02:07:17.560 --> 02:07:22.680
own license plate. What that has to do with drugs, I don't remember. I don't know. I think

02:07:22.680 --> 02:07:28.280
it was like, if you go to jail, then you'll be making license plates. So they had a make

02:07:28.280 --> 02:07:30.800
your own license plate. But if they wanted to be really realistic,

02:07:30.800 --> 02:07:33.720
you know, they'd have to have the rubber glove up the ass and...

02:07:33.720 --> 02:07:38.360
Yeah, yeah, seriously. They'd have... Cavity surge and bend over and spread them.

02:07:38.360 --> 02:07:42.720
They'd have all us 5th graders take our clothes off and go shower publicly and have Bubba

02:07:42.720 --> 02:07:43.720
fuck us while...

02:07:43.720 --> 02:07:45.720
And teach you how to make hooch.

02:07:45.720 --> 02:07:54.440
Here is a can of Juicy Juice, here is yeast that we use to make the hard tack you have

02:07:54.440 --> 02:07:55.440
to eat.

02:07:55.440 --> 02:07:56.940
Okay, wait, I'm not done with my thought yet.

02:07:56.940 --> 02:08:00.920
So we had to make a license plate and the deal was, you know, you have to have it be

02:08:00.920 --> 02:08:01.920
eight letters.

02:08:01.920 --> 02:08:05.240
So it was like, what would your license plate say, right?

02:08:05.240 --> 02:08:14.440
My license plate was N-I-N-1-0-D-O. Nintendo. Get it?

02:08:14.440 --> 02:08:19.520
You are such a nerd and I like that. I wonder if anyone actually has that license

02:08:19.520 --> 02:08:21.360
plate. Dude, I should get it.

02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:30.040
Aw, if nobody has it in California yet. Remember, Genesis does what Nintendon't.

02:08:30.040 --> 02:08:32.040
What the fuck?

02:08:32.040 --> 02:08:37.040
Sonic the Hedgehog, bitch!

02:08:37.040 --> 02:08:39.040
Bad knuckles.

02:08:39.040 --> 02:08:41.040
And by the way, Shadow the Hedgehog sucks ass.

02:08:41.040 --> 02:08:43.040
But he has a gun.

02:08:43.040 --> 02:08:46.040
I'm just reading some comments in our chatroom, I love it.

02:08:46.040 --> 02:08:50.040
Ron Chan says, super sloppy OLR double dare.

02:08:50.040 --> 02:08:53.040
That's what dare makes you think of that show, double dare.

02:08:53.040 --> 02:08:57.040
And then I still have my dare shirt. That's awesome.

02:08:57.040 --> 02:08:59.040
I didn't think they were still doing dare.

02:08:59.040 --> 02:09:03.040
You know, I expect to see something like that at Hot Topic soon, because they're doing like all the...

02:09:03.040 --> 02:09:04.040
Yes!

02:09:04.040 --> 02:09:06.040
They do have them! They do have them at Hot Topic!

02:09:06.040 --> 02:09:07.040
Do they?

02:09:07.040 --> 02:09:08.040
Yes!

02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:09.040
You know it'd be awesome. I love Hot Topic.

02:09:09.040 --> 02:09:15.040
And then they also have the, um, the, uh, drug testing, and it has like a bunch of drugs sitting in the classroom.

02:09:15.040 --> 02:09:21.040
You know what I want, just for the hell of it, is I want those prop sandwiches that they had on Double there.

02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:28.040
I just want two of those giant pieces of bread to put on my floor. The foam bread. I don't know why that would be so cool, though.

I forgot to mention, a couple weeks ago on Family Guy, they actually referenced You Can't

02:09:59.700 --> 02:10:00.700
Do That television.

02:10:00.700 --> 02:10:03.460
Yes, I actually saw that episode, but we don't encourage people to watch Family Guy.

02:10:03.460 --> 02:10:04.460
That was a couple weeks ago!

02:10:04.460 --> 02:10:08.460
Yeah, it's on the same time as us, so we don't encourage people to go watch that.

02:10:08.460 --> 02:10:09.460
TiVo it!

02:10:09.460 --> 02:10:10.460
It's a good show?

02:10:10.460 --> 02:10:11.460
TiVo or BitTorrent?

02:10:11.460 --> 02:10:12.460
Yes.

02:10:12.460 --> 02:10:14.540
We encourage you to pirate Family Guy because it's our competition.

02:10:14.540 --> 02:10:18.860
Hey, BitTorrent is mainly just free TiVo, that's all it is to me.

02:10:18.860 --> 02:10:22.180
Don't worry, I delete the episodes after 24 hours.

02:10:22.180 --> 02:10:26.580
Yes, 24 hours so that you're not pirating it. Love it.

02:10:26.580 --> 02:10:34.300
All right. We're going to go to a break. Featuring some music this break from Dance Maniacs.

Here's your promo. My bad. Here you go.

02:17:22.660 --> 02:17:25.660
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:17:25.660 --> 02:17:28.660
Because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

02:17:32.660 --> 02:17:34.660
There you go. Sorry about that.

02:17:34.660 --> 02:17:37.660
I was too busy brainstorming for listless.

02:17:37.660 --> 02:17:42.900
We're actually going to allow a guest person to come on List List tonight.

02:17:42.900 --> 02:17:49.780
First person to call in Skype who wants to participate with this topic, Nickelodeon show

02:17:49.780 --> 02:17:54.500

So we'll take whoever calls in first wanting to play that.

02:17:57.460 --> 02:18:01.420
The way List List works, everybody presents their top three.

02:18:01.420 --> 02:18:05.860
So when you call in, please have three shows that you want to do, ready to go.

02:18:05.860 --> 02:18:10.600
then we'll come up with our list and then we each take one off the list. You

02:18:10.600 --> 02:18:15.760
vote one off and then the chat room ultimately gets the final vote when we

02:18:15.760 --> 02:18:20.840
have a list of eight that would be remaining. So if that makes no sense to

02:18:20.840 --> 02:18:25.320
you don't worry it'll make sense to you as we start to go through it. So let's

02:18:25.320 --> 02:18:28.880

pete and pete

02:21:26.580 --> 02:21:30.620
cause it was a strange show but it actually worked and the mom had a metal plate in her head

02:21:30.620 --> 02:21:33.640
exactly it reminds me of malcolm in the middle

02:21:33.640 --> 02:21:35.660
is basically i think is what

02:21:35.660 --> 02:21:38.700
became malcolm in the middle so a brief description of pete and pete

02:21:38.700 --> 02:21:42.480
pete and pete was just a story about um two brothers that you know had the same name

02:21:42.480 --> 02:21:43.860
they're both kinda nerdy

02:21:43.860 --> 02:21:49.020
the one brother had a tattoo um that he used to make dance the mother had a metal plate in her head

02:21:49.020 --> 02:21:53.000
and with the radio signals if she can receive real signal it was just such a

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:53.960
weird

02:21:53.960 --> 02:21:57.800
weird show but it worked it was just one of the shows that actually have pretty

02:21:57.800 --> 02:21:59.420
good storyline to it so it worked

02:21:59.420 --> 02:22:03.020

02:23:04.720 --> 02:23:09.100
all the fact that they can i went through puberty

02:23:09.100 --> 02:23:11.100
That was the sound she used to make.

02:23:11.100 --> 02:23:13.100
And she used to do the really funny, jacked-up fairy tales.

02:23:13.100 --> 02:23:15.100
You remember that?

02:23:15.100 --> 02:23:17.100
And that show was just...

02:23:17.100 --> 02:23:19.100
I always came on right after

02:23:19.100 --> 02:23:21.100
you can't do that on television.

02:23:21.100 --> 02:23:23.100
And Dave Coulier cut it out. Hello.

02:23:23.100 --> 02:23:25.100
Hello. Alright.

02:23:25.100 --> 02:23:27.100
And I always was like,

02:23:27.100 --> 02:23:29.100
okay, this show is awesome.

02:23:29.100 --> 02:23:31.100
And so yeah, that gets my number two.

02:23:31.100 --> 02:23:33.100
Doobs!

02:23:33.100 --> 02:23:35.100
And it had the Python-esque animation in it.

02:23:35.100 --> 02:23:37.100
Doobs, your number two pick.

02:23:37.100 --> 02:23:41.100
Um, I'll just say figure it out. That show was awesome.

02:23:41.100 --> 02:23:44.100
A brief description and why it should be brought back.

02:23:44.100 --> 02:23:51.100
It was that game show where like these kids would come up and they'd have talents and like people had to figure out what their talent was by asking them questions and stuff.

02:23:51.100 --> 02:23:54.100
Was that the one that was hosted by Summer Sanders?

02:23:54.100 --> 02:23:55.100
Yeah, her ex- yeah.

02:23:55.100 --> 02:24:04.100
Dude, she went to my high school. She graduated the year before I was a freshman. She came back and spoke like years later and so I always find that funny. I don't know why.

02:24:04.100 --> 02:24:08.100
I know your dreams. You can't reach your goals. I'm living proof.

02:24:34.100 --> 02:24:39.340
wasn't on Nickelodeon, as far as I'm aware. It might have been at one time, but I don't

02:24:39.340 --> 02:24:44.220
think so. So, Are You Afraid of the Dark? But, like the first season of Are You Afraid

02:24:44.220 --> 02:24:48.780
of the Dark, before it got really crappy, you know, that's what... And this show is

02:24:48.780 --> 02:24:51.700
basically, they told them, they were kind of like ghost stories. It's almost like the

02:24:51.700 --> 02:24:56.460
stupid Goosebumps book thing, you know, but it's better.

02:24:56.460 --> 02:24:59.900
I hate that show.

02:24:59.900 --> 02:25:02.780
Well, Doops, you might know which one you want to bump off then, because you get to

02:25:02.780 --> 02:25:03.780
take one off the list.

02:25:03.780 --> 02:25:06.500
Alright well hold on, there could be worse ones, we'll see.

02:25:06.500 --> 02:25:15.020
My number two pick, hello Nick Arcade, hello, hello, come on like everybody, you geek gamers

02:25:15.020 --> 02:25:21.940
all know what Nick Arcade was, who remembers the last stage of Nick Arcade where you could

02:25:21.940 --> 02:25:24.680
be in the video games?

02:25:24.680 --> 02:25:30.940
Now granted, StarCade was leaps and bounds better, but Nick Arcade was still pretty cool.

02:25:30.940 --> 02:25:33.780
So my number two pick is Nick Arcade.

02:25:33.780 --> 02:25:37.980
All right, we're down to the number one pick, Dark Sakura.

02:25:37.980 --> 02:25:40.900
Mine is Danger Mouse.

02:25:40.900 --> 02:25:43.620
I fucking love Danger Mouse.

02:25:43.620 --> 02:25:44.980
Danger Mouse is pretty awesome.

02:25:44.980 --> 02:25:49.180
Because it's all about Penfold.

02:25:49.180 --> 02:25:51.340
I was just watching a tape of Danger Mouse episodes

02:25:51.340 --> 02:25:52.980
I have at my house, and it was the one

02:25:52.980 --> 02:25:55.540
where Penfold gets into the giant chicken feed

02:25:55.540 --> 02:25:56.820
and turns into a giant Penfold.

02:25:59.620 --> 02:26:00.660
That's pretty awesome.

02:26:00.660 --> 02:26:02.400
yeah

02:26:02.400 --> 02:26:06.760
we hold on i have something just for you jamie along

02:26:06.760 --> 02:26:08.860
i'll dammit over

02:26:08.860 --> 02:26:11.120
way to go rob have the volume down the place

02:26:11.120 --> 02:26:12.260
and food

02:26:12.260 --> 02:26:13.460
shot

02:26:13.460 --> 02:26:15.460
uh... just rewrite

02:26:15.460 --> 02:26:17.980
uh... do you have your number one pick

02:26:17.980 --> 02:26:20.660
uh... all that

02:26:20.660 --> 02:26:22.860
uh...

02:26:22.860 --> 02:26:24.500
god

02:26:24.500 --> 02:26:28.500
and i'm sorry i just a brief description and why it should be there

02:26:28.500 --> 02:26:29.740
it was like uh...

02:26:29.740 --> 02:26:33.740
I say MadTV for kids. It was like one of those variety hour type shit.

02:26:33.740 --> 02:26:35.740
It still is.

02:26:35.740 --> 02:26:37.740
Okay, no, no, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Let me see it.

02:26:37.740 --> 02:26:41.740
I want all that to come back before it had all those preppy white people on it.

02:26:45.740 --> 02:26:47.740
He's got a point. He does have a point.

02:26:47.740 --> 02:26:49.740
Yeah.

02:26:49.740 --> 02:26:52.740
Islander. He said he wants it before the preppy white people ruined it.

02:26:52.740 --> 02:26:55.740
Alright. Pretty white? Damn those pretty white people.

02:26:55.740 --> 02:26:57.740
Pretty white people with foam.

02:26:57.740 --> 02:27:14.740
I mean, I know they have Britney Spears' sister on it now. I was like, whoa. I remember the first couple episodes, it was all like, I remember they had that girl from TLC sing for the intro. I was like, ooh, this is like hip-hop type style. Now I hear like, you know.

02:27:14.740 --> 02:27:16.740
It's like, you know what it reminds me of?

02:27:16.740 --> 02:27:17.740
Britney Spears' sister goes on.

02:27:17.740 --> 02:27:23.740
What he's talking about reminds me of Club MMC. Never mind, forget it.

02:27:23.740 --> 02:27:24.740
Oh, God, no.

02:27:24.740 --> 02:27:26.740
You guys seen Mickey Mouse Club?

02:27:26.740 --> 02:27:33.740
Click click click ding. Yeah, but then remember when it was MMC and it was all like, you know, like, we're hip and we're white and dance hip-hop.

02:27:33.740 --> 02:27:36.740
You know, my friend's mom was a Mouseketeer for a day.

02:27:36.740 --> 02:27:37.740
Wow.

02:27:37.740 --> 02:27:41.740
She actually made it back in the 50s to be a Mouseketeer and then her parents let her.

02:27:41.740 --> 02:27:44.740
My mom is Annette Funicello. Okay, no she's not.

02:27:44.740 --> 02:27:46.740
Uh, Loki, your number one pick.

02:27:46.740 --> 02:27:54.740
Well, you know, where can I go with this? I mean, I've got like a bunch of different ideas of what we could do for like, you know, number one here.

02:27:54.740 --> 02:28:01.740
I thought, okay, here's my toss-up here. I thought about Funhaus because, you know, that was an awesome show.

02:28:01.740 --> 02:28:07.740
But no, so I'm gonna go with a better variety show than all that, and that would be Roundhouse.

02:28:09.740 --> 02:28:10.740
Roundhouse.

02:28:10.740 --> 02:28:13.740
Yeah, we saw guys from Roundhouse at E3.

02:28:13.740 --> 02:28:14.740
Yeah, the guy from Roundhouse.

02:28:14.740 --> 02:28:17.740
At least those guys have freaking talent versus, you know, all that where,

02:28:17.740 --> 02:28:22.900
all that work we're trying to be like sarah not live before kids

02:28:22.900 --> 02:28:27.660
and who can forget the guy from roundhouse at e3

02:28:27.660 --> 02:28:33.860
konami konami yo

02:28:33.860 --> 02:28:37.860
yes he was one of the pretty white kids on roundhouse that was him

02:28:37.860 --> 02:28:41.900
alright and uh... shane loved him yeah shane has a crush on him but that's another story

02:28:41.900 --> 02:28:46.660
alright time for my number one pick and there's so many good ones you could choose from

02:28:46.660 --> 02:28:51.960
Man, screw you all for not naming this show sooner, because this is the king of Nickelodeon

02:28:51.960 --> 02:28:52.960
shows.

02:28:52.960 --> 02:28:54.240
There is no doubt about it.

02:28:54.240 --> 02:28:57.120
Without it, you would not have Green Slime, ever.

02:28:57.120 --> 02:28:59.320
You can't do that on television is my number one thing.

02:28:59.320 --> 02:29:00.320
I was saying that for you.

02:29:00.320 --> 02:29:01.320
I knew you were listening.

02:29:01.320 --> 02:29:03.240
I didn't name it because I knew someone else would.

02:29:03.240 --> 02:29:07.360
And besides that, who else but me is going to say Danger Mouse?

02:29:07.360 --> 02:29:08.360
Alright.

02:29:08.360 --> 02:29:11.760
If, if, if you can't do that on television and have been taken by somebody else, I would

02:29:11.760 --> 02:29:12.760
have said Count Duckula.

02:29:12.760 --> 02:29:14.760
We'll have to do that on our show.

02:29:14.760 --> 02:29:17.760
I would have no Count D'ucula without Danger Mouse.

02:29:17.760 --> 02:29:23.760
If our far show's ever live, we are going to do the green slime if you say I don't know.

02:29:23.760 --> 02:29:25.760
Did you ever see the computer one?

02:29:25.760 --> 02:29:27.760
They said, aha, I have a way around.

02:29:27.760 --> 02:29:29.760
That does not compute.

02:29:29.760 --> 02:29:30.760
Gray slime.

02:29:30.760 --> 02:29:33.760
All right, all right, let's...

02:29:33.760 --> 02:29:34.760
I'm being so yuck.

02:29:34.760 --> 02:29:36.760
Yes, and I remember the red slime and blue slime,

02:29:36.760 --> 02:29:39.760
and I remember the episode where you could vote by touching your TV.

02:29:39.760 --> 02:29:41.760
It was... never mind, anyway.

02:29:41.760 --> 02:29:42.760
What?

02:29:42.760 --> 02:29:43.760
I'm showing my age here, people.

02:29:43.760 --> 02:29:47.360
Alright, here's the vote-off round. This is gonna be a hard one tonight, you guys.

02:29:47.360 --> 02:29:49.760
You have to take one of these off the list.

02:29:49.760 --> 02:29:52.760
Salute your shorts, rugrats, Pete and Pete,

02:29:52.760 --> 02:29:55.560
Hey, dude, out of control, figure it out,

02:29:55.560 --> 02:29:57.960
Are you afraid of the dark, Nick Arcade,

02:29:57.960 --> 02:30:02.560
Danger Mouse, all that, roundhouse, and you can't do that on television.

02:30:02.560 --> 02:30:04.760
Dark Sakura, what's gotta go?

02:30:04.760 --> 02:30:08.360
Uh, move your big head out of the way.

02:30:08.360 --> 02:30:12.560
Uh...

02:30:12.560 --> 02:30:16.360
are you afraid of the dark are you afraid of the dark it's taken off the

02:30:16.360 --> 02:30:18.500
list by dark sacra

02:30:18.500 --> 02:30:22.360
in you knew the dooms was going to take it off so you just give them a free pick

02:30:22.360 --> 02:30:26.040
he and i think you could pick in those two all right dudes which one's gonna

02:30:26.040 --> 02:30:27.780
come off

02:30:27.780 --> 02:30:29.780
uh... he did

02:30:29.780 --> 02:30:33.800
are you bastard i hate it comes out of it is because uh... i i think

02:30:33.800 --> 02:30:35.940
to your children anything to happen on that show

02:30:35.940 --> 02:30:39.320
so i was going to say how old are you because your pics are more new school

02:30:39.320 --> 02:30:44.220
Nickelodeon in my eyes. Well, I'm actually fourteen, but I didn't really watch Nickelodeon

02:30:44.220 --> 02:30:50.580
much. You know what? F you, okay? F you guys. Rob, actually, it was pointed out to me that

02:30:50.580 --> 02:30:57.580
not a one of us mentioned Invader Zim. Ah, dammit! Oh, Loki. I say we have a unanimous

02:30:58.740 --> 02:31:04.320
vote to put Invader Zim on the list. I. All of us vote. Fine, fine. We'll put Invader

02:31:04.320 --> 02:31:06.320
Am I?

02:31:06.320 --> 02:31:08.320
God, I'm so bad.

02:31:08.320 --> 02:31:09.320
Now that's new school, Nickelodeon.

02:31:09.320 --> 02:31:11.320
Alright, Loki, take one of these off the list.

02:31:11.320 --> 02:31:18.320
Dammit, you know, they took off my Hey Dude because I was gonna say that show bit compared to, you know, like, say, Smoother Shorts.

02:31:18.320 --> 02:31:28.320
But I'm gonna take off Rugrats because, I mean, that used to be on, was it, you know, uh, Nick Jr., and that's where it needs to stay, is Nick Jr.

02:31:28.320 --> 02:31:31.320
It used to be back there by Pinwheel.

02:31:31.320 --> 02:31:32.320
Spinning around.

02:31:32.320 --> 02:31:41.320
My turn, huh? I'm gonna have to take off, um... I'm gonna take off Roundhouse. I just...

02:31:41.320 --> 02:31:45.320
There's too many sketch comedy shows on Nickelodeon.

02:31:45.320 --> 02:31:46.320
You have good taste.

02:31:46.320 --> 02:31:48.320
Nah, I do. I have excellent taste. You can't tell this is better.

02:31:48.320 --> 02:31:51.320
Please, we didn't put What Would You Do on that stupid...

02:31:51.320 --> 02:31:56.320
Nobody said Double Dare, but I guess they have a new version of Double Dare. Lots of shows not named.

02:31:56.320 --> 02:32:00.080
All right, here it is, the list that you guys can vote on.

02:32:00.080 --> 02:32:02.920
Salute your shorts, Pete and Pete, out of,

02:32:02.920 --> 02:32:05.320
Dubes, what the hell are you doing over there?

02:32:05.320 --> 02:32:07.160
I don't know, my thing's just messing up, sorry.

02:32:07.160 --> 02:32:08.000
All right, that's all right.

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:09.080
Put out the plastic cover.

02:32:09.080 --> 02:32:11.880
Salute your shorts, Pete and Pete, out of control,

02:32:11.880 --> 02:32:15.920
figure it out, Nick Arcade, Danger Mouse, all that.

02:32:15.920 --> 02:32:19.360
You can't do that on television and Invader Zim.

02:32:19.360 --> 02:32:22.280
You guys can send a vote, you get to vote for one.

02:32:22.280 --> 02:32:24.720
Send a private message to Sky in the chatroom

02:32:24.720 --> 02:32:29.660
with your vote. Some of the ones we missed, you guys, according to the chatroom. Count

02:32:29.660 --> 02:32:34.040
Duckula, Ren and Stimpy. That's a big one.

02:32:34.040 --> 02:32:38.840
Actually, I think Vader Zim should come off the list, because while it's still, it is

02:32:38.840 --> 02:32:41.000
a cancelled show, they still re-run it.

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.040
I'm saying no. We already put them there.

02:32:43.040 --> 02:32:45.200
It should still be on the list.

02:32:45.200 --> 02:32:46.540
Amanda's show?

02:32:46.540 --> 02:32:48.640
No. Clarissa explains it all.

02:32:48.640 --> 02:32:50.320
Clarissa explains it all? Thank you.

02:32:50.320 --> 02:32:53.800
I liked Clarissa explains it all, because of the guy who came in through the window

02:32:53.800 --> 02:33:00.800
and tell me about sexuality if you didn't explain it all but

02:33:01.640 --> 02:33:04.000
but i would rather pictures of alex mac

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:05.200
the adventures of what

02:33:05.200 --> 02:33:06.320
alex mac

02:33:06.320 --> 02:33:09.320

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:49.280
rockaway modern life that they really think boobs all the time but it's good

02:33:49.280 --> 02:33:59.280
You know Rocko's Modern Life? The characters from Rocko is supposed to have a cameo in the Spongebob movie, but I don't remember seeing them.

02:33:59.280 --> 02:34:02.280
Fucking Spongebob Squarepants, but again and again, that's all.

02:34:02.280 --> 02:34:03.280
Thank God!

02:34:03.280 --> 02:34:05.280
It's still on. That's all Nickelodeon is now.

02:34:05.280 --> 02:34:08.280
I hate Spongebob.

02:34:08.280 --> 02:34:11.280
Dude, Spongebob is not that bad.

02:34:11.280 --> 02:34:13.280
No, technically all that is still on there too.

02:34:13.280 --> 02:34:14.280
Is it?

02:34:14.280 --> 02:34:16.280
Yeah, it's still on there.

02:34:16.280 --> 02:34:19.580
Because now that one of the guys from it actually is on Saturday Night Live, they're like,

02:34:19.580 --> 02:34:21.580
Oh, we're famous now.

02:34:21.580 --> 02:34:22.580
Yeah.

02:34:22.580 --> 02:34:23.580
So.

02:34:23.580 --> 02:34:24.580
Whatever.

02:34:24.580 --> 02:34:27.120
Alright, well we'll see how the chat room votes there.

02:34:27.120 --> 02:34:31.240
So again, Salute Your Shorts, Pete and Pete, Out of Control, Figure It Out, Nick Arcade,

02:34:31.240 --> 02:34:32.860
Danger Mouse, all that.

02:34:32.860 --> 02:34:35.040
You can't do that on television and Invader Zim.

02:34:35.040 --> 02:34:38.500
We will find out your top three choices for...

02:34:38.500 --> 02:34:39.500
Legend of the Hidden Temple.

02:34:39.500 --> 02:34:40.500
Guts.

02:34:40.500 --> 02:34:41.500
I know.

02:34:41.500 --> 02:34:43.500
Legend of the Hidden Temple is freaking awesome.

02:34:43.500 --> 02:34:45.500
And Guts was on my list.

02:34:45.500 --> 02:34:49.500
But I took it off in favor of, uh, of whatever the first one was.

02:34:49.500 --> 02:34:50.500
Guts was retarded.

02:34:50.500 --> 02:34:52.500
Well, Guts was a good idea.

02:34:52.500 --> 02:34:55.500
I'll just remember the referee that they had on the show, because-

02:34:55.500 --> 02:34:57.500
We have all these veggie cores, what are we gonna do with them?

02:34:57.500 --> 02:34:59.500
Let's play every game with them.

02:34:59.500 --> 02:35:00.500
The Agrocrag.

02:35:00.500 --> 02:35:01.500
Agrocrag?

02:35:01.500 --> 02:35:05.500
Let's climb up the big glowing purple hunk of plastic.

02:35:05.500 --> 02:35:07.500
Uh oh, I got aggroed by the crag.

02:35:07.500 --> 02:35:11.500
You lost ten minutes because you didn't hit the little charger thing.

02:35:11.500 --> 02:35:12.500
You suck.

02:35:12.500 --> 02:35:13.500
Alright, great.

02:35:13.500 --> 02:35:14.500
Time to go back to kindergarten.

02:35:14.500 --> 02:35:20.500
Hurry up and get your votes in, kids. We gotta get this wrapped up so we can get into the FUs of the week, okay?

02:35:20.500 --> 02:35:29.500
So in this break, I think what we'll do, just a couple quick ones. We're gonna do some third mix songs, I think.

02:35:29.500 --> 02:35:30.500
Because I want to play Wonderland.

02:35:30.500 --> 02:35:31.500
And Neon FM.

02:35:31.500 --> 02:35:34.500
Oh, the Neon FM. We'll get to that, too. I promise we will.

02:35:34.500 --> 02:35:34.500
Uh-huh.

02:35:34.500 --> 02:35:39.500
All right. We'll get to that. So let's get those votes in real quick because we're gonna get to the FUs of the week.

02:35:39.500 --> 02:35:43.500
Don't send your FUs just yet, though, because we gotta get the votes for Listless out of the way first.

02:35:43.500 --> 02:35:46.740
out of the way first so we'll be back after this quick break with more Orange

02:35:46.740 --> 02:35:53.740
launch radio.

02:36:16.740 --> 02:36:19.940
is smooth and easy like, so we might get hyped to hear tonight.

02:36:19.940 --> 02:36:22.740
Be nice, relax, and see for the back, if you ain't with that,

02:36:22.740 --> 02:36:24.740
I'ma have to attack you with a bad rap.

02:36:24.740 --> 02:36:27.740
That could mess with my whoops if they dash for no sauce, no crap.

02:36:27.740 --> 02:36:31.740
Giving a little bit of heart and soul as we do it till you in your ear hole, huh?

02:36:31.740 --> 02:36:35.740
I ain't going out like a sucka, and if you think so, boy, then puff up.

02:36:35.740 --> 02:36:38.740
Puff the chips up out of this lyric and slow the mic word up.

02:36:38.740 --> 02:36:40.740
This groove is set to soothe you.

02:36:40.740 --> 02:36:42.740
We're party people now, it's time to do it

02:37:42.740 --> 02:37:44.740
Oh

02:38:42.740 --> 02:38:49.740
Okay, technically this next song is from 2nd Mix, but Jamie begged.

02:38:49.740 --> 02:38:51.740
I cried

02:39:19.740 --> 02:39:29.740
Cause when we dance together, you're like a dream come true

02:39:29.740 --> 02:39:37.740
I feel so beautiful, hot inside, it's all just a view

02:39:37.740 --> 02:39:43.740
Love, I just gotta have it, I believe in love

02:39:43.740 --> 02:40:09.740
I can't be without it. Come to me and make your confession. Love, come let it go. Love, like it's got a habit I believe in. Love, I can't be without it. Come to me and make your confession. Love, come let it go.

02:40:13.740 --> 02:40:20.740
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:40:43.740 --> 02:40:47.820
Max. Alright, let's, uh, you want to find out tonight's listless winners?

02:40:47.820 --> 02:40:53.060
We did the votes. Yes, K, thanks. This was a toughie. We had a lot of votes kind of

02:40:53.060 --> 02:40:56.240
spread out tonight. Everybody loves Nickelodeon, so I'm glad we could

02:40:56.240 --> 02:40:59.740
talk about it here. Nobody loves MTV, though. Yeah, nobody.

02:40:59.740 --> 02:41:04.400
Uh, seriously, they were, well, I actually watched a little bit of MTV for the first

02:41:04.400 --> 02:41:05.460
time in a long time

02:41:05.460 --> 02:41:08.620
yesterday. There was a marathon of Next,

02:41:08.620 --> 02:41:13.500
which is some type of speed dating show. It's awful. Yeah, I remember. I've seen that show.

02:41:13.500 --> 02:41:17.900
What about they also had a marathon yesterday? I thought of true life. I

02:41:18.500 --> 02:41:23.220
Don't know. I don't know. I don't watch TV. So I have no idea what the fuck either of you were talking about

02:41:23.220 --> 02:41:28.140
All right, listen, it's the one it's like, you know true life. I'm a prostitute or true life, you know

02:41:28.140 --> 02:41:31.540
I'm addicted to speed or you know, they have like usually it's a you know

02:41:31.540 --> 02:41:35.260
It's a drama like one of those afternoon things true life. I hump small boys

02:41:36.340 --> 02:41:38.340
Bad one true life. I'm a furry

02:41:38.340 --> 02:41:42.340
Oh my god, no, I'd have to see that, because that would be hilarious.

02:41:42.340 --> 02:41:44.340
True, they honestly had that, it was great.

02:41:44.340 --> 02:41:47.340
True Life is actually one of the few decent series they have now, I think.

02:41:47.340 --> 02:41:51.340
But, like, all these, like, you know what my friends are into? I don't get this at all.

02:41:51.340 --> 02:41:56.340
They don't watch the real world, they don't watch Road Rules, but what they do watch is that fucking, like, Inferno show.

02:41:56.340 --> 02:42:00.340
Where it's, like, real world meets Road Rules on, I don't know, whatever.

02:42:00.340 --> 02:42:03.340
Isn't, like, MTV all reality shows nowadays now?

02:42:03.340 --> 02:42:05.340
Pretty much. It's MTV.

02:42:05.340 --> 02:42:12.260
MTV. See, I only know three shows on MTV from back in the day, so.

02:42:12.260 --> 02:42:19.180
Yeah, I remember Remote Control, which was like the best show ever.

02:42:19.180 --> 02:42:21.740
And Adam Curry, who is our podcasting hero.

02:42:21.740 --> 02:42:30.420
The only one I remember was, of course, Singled Out, because it had What's Your Face, and

02:42:30.420 --> 02:42:34.420
And of course, you have some bad.

02:42:34.420 --> 02:42:38.420
Yeah, liquid television.

02:42:38.420 --> 02:42:40.420
And I remember Pauly Shore.

02:42:40.420 --> 02:42:42.420
You know that Aeon Flux movie is coming out next year?

02:42:42.420 --> 02:42:43.420
Or is it this year?

02:42:43.420 --> 02:42:45.420
I think I'm going to see that.

02:42:45.420 --> 02:42:46.420
It looks kind of, I don't know.

02:42:46.420 --> 02:42:47.420
I think it's going to be good.

02:42:47.420 --> 02:42:51.420
However, there's one show that I do watch, sort of.

02:42:51.420 --> 02:42:54.420
My Guilty Pleasure on TV is Pimp My Ride.

02:42:54.420 --> 02:42:57.420
Because I want to take my mom's ice cream truck

02:42:57.420 --> 02:43:02.300
and see what they can do with that they would love

02:43:02.300 --> 02:43:05.860
they love crap like that you know where it's just like something weird um

02:43:05.860 --> 02:43:10.020
you know my guilty I'm actually gonna go see a on flux you know but my guilty

02:43:10.020 --> 02:43:11.500
pleasure movie of this year

02:43:11.500 --> 02:43:15.060
on the which is an MTV movie actually is gonna be roll bounce

02:43:15.060 --> 02:43:18.140
the hell's that roll bounce is a movie

02:43:18.140 --> 02:43:21.980
set in the seventies during the roller disco era

02:43:21.980 --> 02:43:25.460
and it's actually it I remember all that basically

02:43:25.460 --> 02:43:30.040
It is, it is, um, you got served on Rulerskate.

02:43:30.040 --> 02:43:31.040
Alright, look.

02:43:31.040 --> 02:43:37.600
I need to see that, okay, no, my fucking, look people, we'll do the MTV show they need

02:43:37.600 --> 02:43:40.960
to bring back at a later date, but we gotta get rid of tonight's listless first.

02:43:40.960 --> 02:43:43.960
Check out the trailer though, it's online on Apple, check it out.

02:43:43.960 --> 02:43:48.500
Alright, let's do this, uh, top three listless tonight Nickelodeon show they should bring

02:43:48.500 --> 02:43:54.480
back, number third, number three, you can't, number third, you can't do that on television

02:44:24.480 --> 02:44:28.880
I'm not going to be watching it. It's not needing Nick Classic.

02:44:28.880 --> 02:44:32.880
Honestly, like, the old school shows need to just run the reruns. Who cares?

02:44:32.880 --> 02:44:36.480
Alright, let's get on to tonight's FUs or we're going to run out of time here.

02:44:36.480 --> 02:44:39.480
So, Jamie, why do we do the FUs of the week every single week?

02:44:39.480 --> 02:44:45.480
Because I hate everybody and everything and I just need to slit my wrists.

02:44:45.480 --> 02:44:49.480
I'll email you.

02:44:49.480 --> 02:44:59.920
Fuck insurance companies, I want my god damn car you bitches.

02:44:59.920 --> 02:45:09.000
Okay I have been, oh hi Barry, I have been without a car, okay get this, I've been without

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:14.540
a car now for a month, a month, a month of no ride.

02:45:14.540 --> 02:45:15.540
I hate it!

02:45:15.540 --> 02:45:18.540
I drove julie's car yesterday and my mother at birth, IT'S SUCKED

02:45:18.540 --> 02:45:19.540
It's like the contestant says

02:45:19.540 --> 02:45:23.540
So, I need a car this week

02:45:23.540 --> 02:45:29.540
And I need my goddamn three thousand dollars check to be here now

02:45:29.540 --> 02:45:32.540
So, I don't care when the fuck you mailed it

02:45:32.540 --> 02:45:35.540
You should have sent that shit Federal Express to my door

02:45:35.540 --> 02:45:42.540
Hand delivered by, you know, young boys dressed in, you know, old pageboy livery or something, I don't know

02:45:42.540 --> 02:45:48.660
it should have been at my door it should have been in my hand a week ago should

02:45:48.660 --> 02:45:53.700
have been in my hand three weeks ago I need a car that's it

02:45:53.700 --> 02:46:01.260
Loki I only have two the first one is this fucking headache that's been on my

02:46:01.260 --> 02:46:06.420
head for two days I say on my head because it switched from the right side

02:46:06.420 --> 02:46:12.500
to the left side last night so now that whatever parasite it is in my head is on

02:46:12.500 --> 02:46:17.000
my left side and it still hurts and it's the Sunday headache and I don't know why

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:22.120
I can't get rid of it anyways and the second thing goes to well actually I

02:46:22.120 --> 02:46:26.280
have three so the second thing goes to the servers on Final Fantasy because

02:46:26.280 --> 02:46:31.200
they're still crashing and they should fix this months ago and I don't know why

02:46:31.200 --> 02:46:35.760
they can't seem to fend off a stupid DNS attack it's just a DNS attack come on

02:46:35.760 --> 02:46:40.440
people you know fix it and the third goes to the phone company for some

02:46:40.440 --> 02:46:45.440
for some reason charging me $80 when they should be charging me $40 for the first time.

02:46:45.440 --> 02:46:54.440
They're saying that I'm like, there's some non, uh, some sort of charges that are non, you know, standard charges or whatever, like 32 bucks.

02:46:54.440 --> 02:47:00.440
I'm like, what the hell is this? I don't have any extra services, so I have to call them and find out what that is tomorrow.

02:47:00.440 --> 02:47:02.440
So, that's it.

02:47:02.440 --> 02:47:14.580
I'm going to give an F you to missing deadlines at work because that really sucks.

02:47:14.580 --> 02:47:19.040
I want to give an F you to earwax because apparently I had a really bad build up of

02:47:19.040 --> 02:47:20.880
earwax in one of my ears.

02:47:20.880 --> 02:47:23.440
No look this is a totally normal thing okay y'all get it.

02:47:23.440 --> 02:47:28.320
Alright I had a really bad build up and I actually lost hearing in my right ear a couple

02:47:28.320 --> 02:47:30.240
days ago and I was totally freaked out.

02:47:30.240 --> 02:47:34.440
like I was like oh my god I'm gonna be deaf and I do radio as a hobby I'm gonna

02:47:34.440 --> 02:47:37.080
be screwed for the rest of my life I'll never be able to play DDR again that's

02:47:37.080 --> 02:47:40.280
why I have one of those cool you know fountain pen things I actually just

02:47:40.280 --> 02:47:45.200
pulled the pen part down and no I work I was trying to clean my ear with a q-tip

02:47:45.200 --> 02:47:49.400
like you know like a normal sanitary person would do that's actually very bad

02:47:49.400 --> 02:47:53.200
for you because what I did is I actually pushed the wax in further with a q-tip

02:47:53.200 --> 02:47:56.500
and made myself lose hearing yeah don't push it in you got to go around well

02:47:56.500 --> 02:48:01.320
that's what I was trying to do but somehow I pushed it in. So anyway, kids, if you have

02:48:01.320 --> 02:48:04.740
your wax filled up, go to the store and get the liquid that you put in your ear because

02:48:04.740 --> 02:48:12.460
that's the only way you're going to do it. Don't use a Q-tip. Swim in a pool, folks.

02:48:12.460 --> 02:48:17.320
And I guess that's it. So an F.U. to $15 co-pays to get your earwax removed. That's pretty

02:48:17.320 --> 02:48:24.560
bad. All right, let's go to Islander. F.U. to airborne viruses.

02:48:24.560 --> 02:48:31.560
Why can't more diseases be like, I don't know, HIV?

02:48:31.560 --> 02:48:38.560
Where it's like, you know, you know what you have to do to get it, so if you just avoid that, you won't get it?

02:48:38.560 --> 02:48:44.560
No, the flu has to be something you can just give to someone by talking to them.

02:48:44.560 --> 02:48:45.560
Dammit.

02:48:48.560 --> 02:48:49.560
That's pretty much it.

02:48:49.560 --> 02:48:53.560
Alright, thank god you can't catch Ugly.

02:48:57.560 --> 02:49:01.560

02:49:06.560 --> 02:49:07.560
Yes, it's Doobs.

02:49:07.560 --> 02:49:09.560

going out of my way to satisfy customers even though I'm just a cashier

02:50:10.440 --> 02:50:13.640
illusion says F you to my uncle's wife's

02:50:13.640 --> 02:50:17.040
gay brother that is covering it up by marrying a woman that is so into herself

02:50:17.040 --> 02:50:18.800
that you won't need any love for herself

02:50:18.800 --> 02:50:19.920

02:50:21.760 --> 02:50:25.480
thirtieth birthday party that was full of boring rich people that only played corny

02:50:25.480 --> 02:50:26.440
songs like

02:50:26.440 --> 02:50:29.520
this song is for all the girls or whatever it was

02:50:29.520 --> 02:50:32.500
if you're not being able to go to karaoke because of this party

02:50:32.500 --> 02:50:35.360
and at the end of the weekend being boring because of nothing to do this

02:50:35.360 --> 02:50:36.080
weekend

02:50:36.080 --> 02:50:39.280
but i did finally get to watch rocky horror picture show

02:50:56.660 --> 02:51:00.380
you've got to be kidding

02:51:00.380 --> 02:51:01.880
while

02:51:01.880 --> 02:51:06.020
they could fit that in there while you while you while other kids

02:51:06.020 --> 02:51:08.940

trade so or copycat trade thank you really see that

02:51:16.940 --> 02:51:20.380
my question is where do you think it'd get the use condoms

02:51:20.380 --> 02:51:23.020
and their parents

02:51:23.020 --> 02:51:24.660
he should like how that should provide

02:51:24.660 --> 02:51:27.000
mmm better or something

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:30.400
here the middle of the place

02:51:30.400 --> 02:51:32.820
go go play go blow up these balloons

02:51:32.820 --> 02:51:37.420
uh... haru chances at the altar makes an ultimate to for having such horrible

02:51:37.420 --> 02:51:42.420
I disagree but whatever. You know actually some girl got AIDS from that. Stop it.

02:51:42.420 --> 02:51:45.420
And for their not having more Konami Bimani games in the U.S.

02:51:45.420 --> 02:51:51.420
Suguru-chan says last F.U. for my boyfriend using me and cosplay.

02:51:51.420 --> 02:51:59.420
Darklionxvi says F.U. to David Williams for calling my pocket aces with his 6-7 of clubs on the World Series of Poker.

02:51:59.420 --> 02:52:05.420
No limit tourney. The flop came 8-5-9 of clubs for the straight flush eliminating me in the process.

02:52:05.420 --> 02:52:11.500
f you to myself for playing one more lovely another forgetting to turn off hard mode mode oops and

02:52:13.140 --> 02:52:17.040
lastly a guana girl says f you to bad car batteries and

02:52:17.500 --> 02:52:22.300
Corrosion that causes Jessica to be stuck out in the heat and wind for seven and a half hours

02:52:23.140 --> 02:52:25.140
ouch

02:52:26.340 --> 02:52:29.620
Look on the bright side though at least you didn't have a sign to twirl

02:52:29.940 --> 02:52:34.820
Because I don't get the sign twirlers like have you ever seen those guys that stand out there in the middle of the road?

02:52:34.820 --> 02:52:38.900
twirling the signs. I get confused where they want me to go. Is it up in the air? Is it

02:52:38.900 --> 02:52:42.660
to the left? Is it to the right? They keep spinning that shit around. What a sucky job

02:52:42.660 --> 02:52:45.540
to have, because then you really are standing out in the sun for seven and a half hours.

02:52:45.540 --> 02:52:48.900
I mean, granted, at least you get to get paid for it and you listen to music. Maybe strippers

02:52:48.900 --> 02:52:52.980
doing that shit. Then I go to wherever they want me to go. That's a great idea. When they

02:52:52.980 --> 02:52:57.380
open up hooters here in Sacramento. Which, what are we doing? They have had commercials.

02:52:57.380 --> 02:53:03.580
I have seen commercials on VH1, advertising, become a hooter girl. I was like, it's coming.

02:53:03.580 --> 02:53:05.580
It's coming! Soon!

02:53:05.580 --> 02:53:09.580
We are like, what, the last city in the nation to get a Hooters.

02:53:09.580 --> 02:53:12.580
Seriously, LA has five billion.

02:53:12.580 --> 02:53:16.580
I think Sacramento is the last city in the nation, big city, to get a Hooters.

02:53:16.580 --> 02:53:17.580
We're finally getting one.

02:53:17.580 --> 02:53:20.580
We're also getting a Logan's Roadhouse, which also makes me happy.

02:53:20.580 --> 02:53:21.580
Alright.

02:53:21.580 --> 02:53:27.580
Somebody in the chat room is yelling at me because they are assigned to our lives.

02:53:27.580 --> 02:53:31.580
You know, there's actually someone down the street from where I live

02:53:31.580 --> 02:53:38.000
who does this for a living straight up dancing Dan if he doesn't have a gig

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:44.840
going his sign says hire me Wow I in this guy this dude says 1150 an hour is

02:53:44.840 --> 02:53:50.180
what he makes doing that I know oh well I mean like we're just doing that now I

02:53:50.180 --> 02:53:55.200
understand how to put Nellie on the corner man cuz she's not making that

02:53:55.200 --> 02:53:58.520
kind of money you are gonna put your fiance on the corner have her work the

02:53:58.520 --> 02:54:03.480
corner. Seriously, that's some good money there. That's awesome. Plus she's bitching

02:54:03.480 --> 02:54:13.480
about not having a tan. There you go. That's a twofer. You're a bastard. Who would want

02:54:13.480 --> 02:54:22.360
to marry you? Alright, we promised some clips from Neon FM and we've made you wait long

02:54:22.360 --> 02:54:27.280
enough, so here they are. Here's some clips from the new dance game, Neon FM. Let's listen

02:54:27.280 --> 02:54:49.200
of some of these, see what we think. 1981. Sounds like a lot of Naoki songs I've heard

02:54:49.200 --> 02:54:53.080
before, but that's kind of cute that they invoke that. So, what do you guys think, real

02:54:53.080 --> 02:55:17.160
quickly. I don't know what the point of 1981 is. Whatever. Bride and Dream. Dude it's like

02:55:17.160 --> 02:55:20.080
An Ayumi Tomisaki techno song.

02:55:20.080 --> 02:55:22.520
Time to drop to E and go to a rave or something.

02:55:22.520 --> 02:55:26.800
I have heard that whole song before, I remember, somewhere, and it's really good.

02:55:26.800 --> 02:55:29.800
That's kinda hot, I like that. Bring the beat back.

02:55:43.080 --> 02:55:45.520
Wow, that bitch is off-key.

02:55:45.520 --> 02:55:46.880
Is it just me?

02:55:46.880 --> 02:55:53.880
Yes, well, once she's off-key, and I think they, for me, for that song to be cool, they need to lose, like, that, like, techno-ish aspect.

02:55:53.880 --> 02:55:57.880
It's okay. I'm actually liking this so far, though. This isn't bad. I like this.

02:55:57.880 --> 02:55:58.880
Can you feel the music?

02:55:58.880 --> 02:56:02.880
Can you feel the music?

02:56:02.880 --> 02:56:06.880
Can you feel the music?

02:56:06.880 --> 02:56:10.880
Can you feel the music?

02:56:10.880 --> 02:56:14.880
Can you feel the music?

02:56:14.880 --> 02:56:20.880
Can you feel the music? I kinda like that. Do you have an artist list up so we can tell you who the artists for these songs are?

02:56:20.880 --> 02:56:24.880
Go to the site so we can get some of that, because I only have the song titles here. You like that one, Dark Sucker?

02:56:24.880 --> 02:56:26.880
Yeah, I do like that one a whole bunch.

02:56:26.880 --> 02:56:28.880
Alright, Complete Shot.

02:56:34.880 --> 02:56:36.880
Oh yeah, we heard this one earlier. That's alright.

02:56:36.880 --> 02:56:38.880
Wait, what was that song again?

02:56:38.880 --> 02:56:39.880
Complete Shot.

02:56:39.880 --> 02:56:40.880
No, the one before that.

02:56:40.880 --> 02:56:41.880

I'm in control of the air that you breathe

02:57:19.720 --> 02:57:21.720
Is that the Alien 6-3?

02:57:21.720 --> 02:57:23.720
No, no, no, that's...

02:57:23.720 --> 02:57:25.720
Damn, I've heard of that.

02:57:25.720 --> 02:57:27.720
The Nine.

02:57:27.720 --> 02:57:29.720
It's from...

02:57:29.720 --> 02:57:31.720
It's a different drum song.

02:57:31.720 --> 02:57:33.720
You can actually get the whole song on Amazon for free.

02:57:33.720 --> 02:57:35.720
Because I know, listen to that.

02:57:35.720 --> 02:57:37.720
The Nine, you're right, that's it.

02:57:37.720 --> 02:57:39.720
Enough of you.

02:57:39.720 --> 02:57:41.720
Thomas Howard.

02:57:41.720 --> 02:57:43.720
Thomas Howard.

02:57:43.720 --> 02:57:45.720

This song came out a long time ago.

02:58:48.980 --> 02:58:53.900
Again, we're playing clips from new songs on Neon FM which are available on Neon FM's website, yes?

02:58:53.900 --> 02:58:57.540

Sounds good. Hi-G again with Play 240.

02:59:04.540 --> 02:59:23.540
DJ Potato featuring THL, this is Put Her In Reverse.

02:59:23.540 --> 02:59:24.540
What?

02:59:24.540 --> 02:59:26.540
I feel like I should be waving my hands in a para-para motion.

02:59:26.540 --> 02:59:27.540
Seriously.

02:59:27.540 --> 02:59:28.640

02:59:53.300 --> 02:59:54.780
aha

02:59:54.780 --> 03:00:01.780
Gotcha! That's why. You guys know this one if you've ever played frequency.

03:00:02.740 --> 03:00:09.420
Dude, freeze pop rocks! You shut up. That was the highest genius. I like some freeze pop, I just didn't care for that freeze pop song.

03:00:09.420 --> 03:00:11.040
uh... deejays

03:00:11.040 --> 03:00:18.040

03:00:26.420 --> 03:00:27.860
not bad not bad

03:00:27.860 --> 03:00:29.860
Freezepop, again, Stakeout.

03:00:40.860 --> 03:00:43.860
That's the song that almost got retired in the cage match,

03:00:43.860 --> 03:00:47.860
but Jamie decided in a tie vote its fourth week to go for the other song.

03:00:48.860 --> 03:00:52.860
Sorry, that much Freezepop every so often makes my head want to go floaty.

03:00:52.860 --> 03:00:54.860
You'll love this. Super Sproat is another song.

03:00:54.860 --> 03:01:17.860
song. DJ Potato with Tune In. This is a theme song also. I don't know for a theme song,

03:01:17.860 --> 03:01:21.260
that's a little weird. Well they had a different, it's like a different version of that or cut

03:01:21.260 --> 03:01:26.420
of that, but actually it was really good when I saw the preview video.

03:01:26.420 --> 03:01:33.580
Alien number 613, You Got The City.

03:01:33.580 --> 03:01:36.780
I'm digging this one, it makes me think of Chemical Love from Busta Move.

03:01:36.780 --> 03:01:41.500
I am really digging that.

03:01:41.500 --> 03:01:48.500
lastly zap remix

03:02:00.940 --> 03:02:02.620
burning heat sort of feel to it

03:02:02.620 --> 03:02:06.700
kinda weird wasn't that the same artist that did the great gianna

03:02:06.700 --> 03:02:08.780
sisters or whatever the

03:02:08.780 --> 03:02:15.780
the remix of that on overclock to that sounds awfully similar to no idea

03:02:16.400 --> 03:02:18.200
whatever but it is a good start

03:02:18.200 --> 03:02:21.400
concert music why you know what that thought i you know it just

03:02:21.400 --> 03:02:26.360
keeps me pretty uh... excited about that i was excited but i'm looking forward to

03:02:26.360 --> 03:02:29.440
that i'm looking forward to at least it's something fresh let me put it that

03:02:29.440 --> 03:02:32.720
way i know it's something different so it looks like it's gonna be pretty neat

03:02:32.720 --> 03:02:35.180
product some of the songs are hit and miss but you know every dance game has

03:02:35.180 --> 03:02:42.060
that. So it's meant for a variety of people. Alright, cool. We're at the end of the show,

03:02:42.060 --> 03:02:47.820
boys and girls. It's final thought time. Islander, thanks for being here tonight. Appreciate

03:02:47.820 --> 03:02:56.060
it. Final thought? Um, final thought. Um, why am I blanking out? I don't know. Final

03:02:56.060 --> 03:03:03.460
thought? Um, drink more orange juice. Loki, your final thought for tonight? No, I had

03:03:03.460 --> 03:03:04.700
something

03:03:04.700 --> 03:03:06.300
and I can't remember what it was

03:03:06.300 --> 03:03:09.300
but uh... all I'm going to say is two things

03:03:09.300 --> 03:03:13.700
one, go vote for our podcast on podcast alley go do it now

03:03:13.700 --> 03:03:15.260

03:03:15.260 --> 03:03:17.100
you want to, you know you want to

03:03:17.100 --> 03:03:21.100
and uh... also go check out my myspace, I'm giving him the link in the

03:03:21.100 --> 03:03:24.380
chat room right now, okay and also go check out my myspace page

03:03:24.380 --> 03:03:26.900

03:03:26.900 --> 03:03:30.820
low key fusion and that's where you're going to find the you know when I unveil brand new

03:03:30.820 --> 03:03:33.240
new songs, or even upload works in progress.

03:03:33.240 --> 03:03:35.100
So check out that page.

03:03:35.100 --> 03:03:37.400
It's got a spiffy little thing you can download,

03:03:37.400 --> 03:03:41.740
like a couple songs, including the Ecstasy remix and the

03:03:41.740 --> 03:03:44.600
Radical Faith remix, which you might not have heard.

03:03:44.600 --> 03:03:45.260
It's on there.

03:03:45.260 --> 03:03:47.860
And also, there's a cool little banner that I made.

03:03:47.860 --> 03:03:49.820
And it's pretty nice.

03:03:49.820 --> 03:03:51.140
So anyways, check it out.

03:03:51.140 --> 03:03:53.500
It's MySpace.com slash Loki Fusion.

03:03:53.500 --> 03:03:54.740
Loki Fusion, all one word.

03:03:54.740 --> 03:03:57.060
All right, I'll put that in the chat room as well.

03:03:57.060 --> 03:04:00.000
My final thought is, because I promised somebody I would say

03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:06.000
again. Hyperion, 7. Murdock is password god, right?

03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:11.000
Yes, that's where I play. DarkSakura, your final thought.

03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:18.360
Reject false ferrets. Alright, and final word of the show. You know

03:04:18.360 --> 03:04:21.880
I gotta give it to the guest when we have one. Islander, one word that sums it all up.

03:04:21.880 --> 03:04:24.400
See you guys next week. We appreciate you tuning in tonight.

03:04:24.400 --> 03:04:26.980
You know, one word isn't going to do it.

03:04:26.980 --> 03:04:28.980
It has to be two.

03:04:28.980 --> 03:04:30.660
Go Spuds.

03:04:30.660 --> 03:04:36.220
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

03:04:36.220 --> 03:04:40.420

And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

03:05:02.900 --> 03:05:09.200
Approach students, close the circle at the feet of the master.

03:05:09.200 --> 03:05:16.660
You have come to me asking that I be your guide along the path of Taekwon leap, but

03:05:16.660 --> 03:05:22.760
Be warned! To learn its ways, you must learn the ways of your own soul.

03:05:22.760 --> 03:05:27.760
Let us meditate upon this wisdom now. So...

03:05:27.760 --> 03:05:31.760
Ohhhhhh...

03:05:31.760 --> 03:05:37.560
Ah! Sir! Sir! Ooh! Ooh! Sir!

03:05:37.560 --> 03:05:42.760
Who disturbs our meditation as a pebble disturbs the stillness of the pond?

03:05:42.760 --> 03:05:45.560
Me!

03:05:45.560 --> 03:05:47.060
Ed Gruberman?

03:05:51.060 --> 03:05:52.560
Ed Gruberman.

03:05:52.560 --> 03:05:57.560
Yeah, uh, no disrespect or nothing, but like, how long is this gonna take?

03:05:58.560 --> 03:06:05.060
Taekwon Leap is not a path to a door, but a road leading forever towards the horizon.

03:06:05.560 --> 03:06:08.060
So like, what, an hour or so?

03:06:10.560 --> 03:06:14.060
No, no, we have not even begun upon the path.

03:06:14.060 --> 03:06:18.760
Ed Grubermann you must learn patience. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah patience. How long will that take?

03:06:21.200 --> 03:06:28.700
Time has no meaning to a true student a year is as a day here. I want to beat people up right now

03:06:29.500 --> 03:06:31.500
I've got the pajamas

03:06:31.500 --> 03:06:33.500
oooh, yeah, hmm!

03:06:39.280 --> 03:06:40.660
Beat people up.

03:06:40.660 --> 03:06:44.660
Yeah, just show me all those nifty moves so I can start trashing bozos.

03:06:44.800 --> 03:06:46.800
That's all I came here for.

03:06:46.800 --> 03:06:48.800
Yaaaaaaa, pretty good idea!

03:06:48.800 --> 03:06:52.740
The only use of Taiwan Leap is self-defense.

03:06:52.740 --> 03:06:54.340
Do you know who said that?

03:06:54.340 --> 03:06:57.040
Ki Lo Ni, the Great Teacher.

03:06:57.040 --> 03:07:03.440
Yeah? Well, the best defense is a good offense. You know who said that? Mel, the cook on Alice.

03:07:08.000 --> 03:07:14.960
Well, um, Tae Kwon Lip is the wine of purity, not the vinegar of hostility.

03:07:15.600 --> 03:07:17.520
Meditate upon this truth with us.

03:07:20.320 --> 03:07:23.440
Listen, shrimp! Now are you going to show me some fancy moves,

03:07:23.440 --> 03:07:26.000
or am I going to start wiping the walls with you?

03:07:26.000 --> 03:07:29.000
Ed Grubermann, you failed to grasp Taekwon Leap.

03:07:29.000 --> 03:07:31.000
Approach me that you might see.

03:07:31.000 --> 03:07:33.000
Alright, finally some action.

03:07:33.000 --> 03:07:35.000
Observe closely, class.

03:07:36.000 --> 03:07:37.000
Boot to the head.

03:07:39.000 --> 03:07:42.000
Ow, you pulling me in the head!

03:07:43.000 --> 03:07:45.000
You are lucky, Ed Grubermann.

03:07:45.000 --> 03:07:49.000
Few novices experience so much of Taekwon Leap so soon.

03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:52.000
Now we continue.

03:07:52.000 --> 03:07:54.000
Ahhhhhhhhh....

03:07:54.000 --> 03:07:56.000
Hey! Hey, I wasn't ready!

03:07:56.000 --> 03:07:58.000
Come and get me now, shorty, huh?

03:07:58.000 --> 03:08:00.000
Come on, are you chicken?

03:08:00.000 --> 03:08:02.000
Boot to the head.

03:08:02.000 --> 03:08:04.000
Ow! Okay, now I'm ready, okay?

03:08:04.000 --> 03:08:06.000
Now, come on, try it now!

03:08:06.000 --> 03:08:08.000
Boot to the head.

03:08:08.000 --> 03:08:12.000
Mind if I just lie down here for a minute?

03:08:12.000 --> 03:08:16.000
Now, class, we shall return to our-

03:08:16.000 --> 03:08:17.000
Master?

03:08:17.000 --> 03:08:19.000
It is wrong to tip the vessel of knowledge, student.

03:08:19.000 --> 03:08:24.680
many apologies master but I feel Ed Gruberman is not wholly wrong what do you

03:08:24.680 --> 03:08:30.000
mean I want to boot some head to have you learned nothing from the lesson of

03:08:30.000 --> 03:08:35.820
Ed Gruberman yes master I have learned two things first that anger is a weapon

03:08:35.820 --> 03:08:40.960
only to one's opponent very good and secondly get in the first shot boot to

03:08:40.960 --> 03:08:47.680
the head you missed oh yeah well you two shall be honored you don't have to you

03:08:47.680 --> 03:08:49.680
I know. I got a big arm.

03:08:49.680 --> 03:08:51.680
Boot to the head.

03:08:51.680 --> 03:08:55.680
Can anyone tell us what lesson has been learned here?

03:08:55.680 --> 03:08:58.680
Yes, Master. Not a single one of us could defeat you.

03:08:58.680 --> 03:09:00.680
You gain wisdom, child.

03:09:00.680 --> 03:09:02.680
So I'll have to gang up on you. Get him, go!

03:09:02.680 --> 03:09:04.680
Boot to the head. Booty.

03:09:10.680 --> 03:09:14.680
And now, class, let us rejoin the mind to the body

03:09:14.680 --> 03:09:17.920
and gaze into the heart of the candle in meditation.

03:09:23.920 --> 03:09:25.920
Very good class.

03:09:41.520 --> 03:09:43.520
People talking in movies shows

03:09:43.520 --> 03:09:50.520
People smoking in bed. People voting Republican. Give them a boot to the head.

03:09:50.520 --> 03:09:58.520
Boot to the head! Boot to the head! Boot to the head! Boot to the head!

03:09:58.520 --> 03:10:14.040
Botanics who can't fix a car, Politicians who can't think,

03:10:14.040 --> 03:10:17.920
The salesman who won't leave me alone, The waiter who forgot my drink.

03:10:47.920 --> 03:11:04.320
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:11:17.920 --> 03:11:28.640
I thought I was just putting the song up, but I forgot that I had that as the whole

03:11:28.640 --> 03:11:29.640
thing.

03:11:29.640 --> 03:11:33.480
My chat room got a kick out of that, so we appreciate anything that can get the chat

03:11:33.480 --> 03:11:36.840
room all happy and stuff, because the chat room is really what keeps us going with the

03:11:36.840 --> 03:11:37.840
show.

03:11:37.840 --> 03:11:38.840
The chat room needs happy pants.

03:11:38.840 --> 03:11:39.840
Kisses!

03:11:39.840 --> 03:11:42.600
All right, thanks you guys so much for tuning in and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

03:11:42.600 --> 03:11:43.600
We really appreciate it.

03:11:43.600 --> 03:11:45.040
I just broke my damn headphones.

03:11:45.040 --> 03:11:46.040
That's really great.

03:11:46.040 --> 03:11:51.860
Alright, thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening tonight to Orange Lounge

03:11:51.860 --> 03:11:52.860

03:11:52.860 --> 03:11:55.100
We hope to see you again next week, and the week after, and the week after that.

03:11:55.100 --> 03:11:58.880
You're now going to get dumped from our stream, but please, re-tune back into the station

03:11:58.880 --> 03:12:01.160
in about 15 seconds to resume...

03:12:01.160 --> 03:12:02.160
What?

03:12:02.160 --> 03:12:03.160
What?

03:12:03.160 --> 03:12:04.160

03:12:05.160 --> 03:12:06.160
What?

03:12:06.160 --> 03:12:07.160
What?

03:12:07.160 --> 03:12:08.160

03:12:13.160 --> 03:12:14.160

03:12:14.160 --> 03:12:15.160

Thank you very much.
