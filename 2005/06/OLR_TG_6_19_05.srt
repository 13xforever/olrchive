[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of June 20th, 2005.

2
00:00:03,415 --> 00:00:14,600
[SPEAKER_00]: You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

3
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,342
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:29,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, everybody, and welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio To Go, video game radio dedicated to games that don't suck.

5
00:00:29,528 --> 00:00:32,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, you know, once in a while, we got to talk about some games that suck.

6
00:00:32,871 --> 00:00:37,855
[SPEAKER_03]: And tonight, towards the end of the program, we're going to talk about movies that are going to suck, I assure you.

7
00:00:38,275 --> 00:00:39,216
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts.

8
00:00:39,256 --> 00:00:40,237
[SPEAKER_03]: You might know me as Sky.

9
00:00:40,277 --> 00:00:43,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Joining me as always, my awesome co-host, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:44,605 --> 00:00:48,808
[SPEAKER_01]: Dust, dust, dust, dirt, and cat poo.

11
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:51,170
[SPEAKER_03]: How very random.

12
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:51,911
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind?

13
00:00:52,131 --> 00:00:54,713
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been moving and changing cat litter.

14
00:00:55,593 --> 00:00:55,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Fun.

15
00:00:56,534 --> 00:00:59,336
[SPEAKER_01]: My life is a never-ending swirl of dust.

16
00:00:59,376 --> 00:01:00,657
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm in Kansas.

17
00:01:00,817 --> 00:01:03,860
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought maybe you were finding cat poo in very hideous places.

18
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,262
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, that would be a cat who would be in a lot of trouble.

19
00:01:07,282 --> 00:01:07,783
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

20
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:11,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Also joining us, the one and only, infamous Loki!

21
00:01:11,812 --> 00:01:14,179
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take the contents of my wallet for 500, Alex.

22
00:01:17,546 --> 00:01:20,047
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?

23
00:01:20,427 --> 00:01:21,048
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hungry.

24
00:01:21,428 --> 00:01:26,810
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't eaten since 2pm and it's now, what, 7 hours later?

25
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,390
[SPEAKER_02]: You could have some damn.

26
00:01:28,911 --> 00:01:29,951
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want any damn.

27
00:01:30,371 --> 00:01:33,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn, by the way, is the candy I got at Ikea that looks like Heath Bars.

28
00:01:33,452 --> 00:01:39,115
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of been a running gag all night long on our 3-hour program that we do on Sunday nights via OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

29
00:01:39,135 --> 00:01:40,395
[SPEAKER_01]: They would know that if they were listening.

30
00:01:41,715 --> 00:01:45,537
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been passing my time by grading sedans.

31
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Grading Sedans.

32
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Grading Sedans.

33
00:01:48,761 --> 00:01:49,181
[SPEAKER_02]: How so?

34
00:01:49,261 --> 00:01:49,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Like cheese.

35
00:01:50,121 --> 00:01:52,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I know what you're talking about because I grate SUVs.

36
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:54,742
[SPEAKER_03]: The one and only WarioWare Twisted.

37
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,343
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have nerves that get grated.

38
00:01:57,383 --> 00:02:07,266
[SPEAKER_02]: I also found that there's one game in there that's completely easy to play and you can get infinite levels on because it requires you to do nothing.

39
00:02:08,526 --> 00:02:09,046
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

40
00:02:10,967 --> 00:02:11,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

41
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Mind games with my fiancÃ©.

42
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:14,961
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, um...

43
00:02:28,723 --> 00:02:31,805
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just a required part of being engaged to a guy.

44
00:02:32,885 --> 00:02:37,548
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't really had a lot of time to play any games, except I did play some PSO this week.

45
00:02:38,388 --> 00:02:40,269
[SPEAKER_01]: I had forgotten I did play some PSO.

46
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:42,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, wait, I thought Blue Burst beta closed.

47
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:43,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you talking about Xbox?

48
00:02:43,151 --> 00:02:45,732
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm paying for PSO Blue Burst.

49
00:02:45,812 --> 00:02:49,334
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought there was going to be a gap between... It went live.

50
00:02:49,475 --> 00:02:50,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, cool.

51
00:02:50,515 --> 00:02:54,077
[SPEAKER_01]: So I paid on Monday and played on Wednesday.

52
00:02:54,157 --> 00:02:56,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Is Blue Burst going to be sold over the counter?

53
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:57,319
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's downloadable.

54
00:02:58,072 --> 00:02:59,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Puzzle Pirates Puzzle Pirates

55
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,862
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan's been playing a lot of Initial D ever since I got my car.

56
00:03:17,943 --> 00:03:21,846
[SPEAKER_01]: For those who don't know, I have a 2002 Mitsubishi Lancer OZ Rally.

57
00:03:22,247 --> 00:03:29,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Now he's talking about getting an Evolution, so he's been going crazy on Initial D on PS2, making Evolutions.

58
00:03:29,593 --> 00:03:30,794
[SPEAKER_01]: He's playing an Evo 7 right now.

59
00:03:30,954 --> 00:03:33,736
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can imagine you are probably sick of Eurobeat at this point.

60
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:38,410
[SPEAKER_01]: and he comes in my car and drives it and makes me listen to Eurobeat.

61
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,311
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, no, no, no.

62
00:03:39,891 --> 00:03:41,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Gorillas.

63
00:03:41,091 --> 00:03:44,332
[SPEAKER_03]: He does realize that your Lancer is not Initial D, right?

64
00:03:45,373 --> 00:03:46,693
[SPEAKER_01]: He got challenged to a race, though.

65
00:03:47,473 --> 00:03:48,994
[SPEAKER_01]: I got challenged to a race.

66
00:03:49,894 --> 00:03:50,954
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, turn.

67
00:03:53,555 --> 00:03:54,455
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a 2.0.

68
00:03:54,956 --> 00:03:55,516
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way.

69
00:03:56,576 --> 00:04:02,238
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it would have smoked the little piece of crap Civic Hybrid that was challenging me.

70
00:04:03,656 --> 00:04:05,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do people do that, seriously?

71
00:04:05,297 --> 00:04:06,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Get a life, people.

72
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:08,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what have you been up to, game-wise?

73
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:15,963
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason why they do that is because they see movies like Too Fast, Too Furious, and Fast and the Furious, and the insert racing movie here.

74
00:04:16,544 --> 00:04:19,465
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because, yeah, they're stupid.

75
00:04:19,886 --> 00:04:29,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, I've been playing WarioWare Twisted today, and I'm trying to unlock all the wonderful goodies there, and there's tons to unlock.

76
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,970
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

77
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:42,510
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been passing my time.

78
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:48,052
[SPEAKER_02]: But the controls, the only thing that pisses me off is the camera doesn't change with you when you turn in the PC version.

79
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:53,475
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to adjust the camera with the mouse at the same time and it's not very convenient for me.

80
00:04:53,895 --> 00:04:59,517
[SPEAKER_02]: So I need to find a way to get it to move the camera with it or something so I can actually play the game.

81
00:04:59,537 --> 00:05:01,438
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you try the special mod?

82
00:05:02,558 --> 00:05:03,659
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't gotten to that.

83
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:07,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I tried to take her out on a date and she wanted to, you know,

84
00:05:08,263 --> 00:05:12,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Do a drive-by, because that's what you do on dates in Los Santos, I guess.

85
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,313
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that sex mod was a load of crap.

86
00:05:17,597 --> 00:05:18,297
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

87
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I showed you the stuff from that last week.

88
00:05:20,678 --> 00:05:23,239
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was shown to be a Photoshop or something.

89
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:24,519
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was real.

90
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:25,680
[SPEAKER_02]: I have video.

91
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,600
[SPEAKER_02]: I have video of it.

92
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,000
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a Photoshop.

93
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Weird.

94
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,361
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, all right.

95
00:05:29,761 --> 00:05:33,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in other news also... It doesn't surprise me, sadly.

96
00:05:33,222 --> 00:05:38,463
[SPEAKER_02]: In other news, that mod, they've made it for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions of the game.

97
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,544
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get patches for it.

98
00:05:41,224 --> 00:05:43,825
[SPEAKER_03]: People will see their boobies no matter what it takes.

99
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:08,315
[SPEAKER_02]: You have an army of sluts carrying dildos and vibrators and they are chasing after you.

100
00:06:08,395 --> 00:06:13,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, you are in a gimp outfit with a dildo.

101
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:17,181
[SPEAKER_02]: I was killing people with the dildo.

102
00:06:17,561 --> 00:06:22,084
[SPEAKER_02]: I went through and adjusted the damage rates for each weapon.

103
00:06:22,124 --> 00:06:29,530
[SPEAKER_02]: My spray paint was pure anthrax or something because it was instant death for everything that basically touched it.

104
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,211
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a lot of fun.

105
00:06:32,242 --> 00:06:36,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and we wonder why parents complain about these games.

106
00:06:39,906 --> 00:06:40,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

107
00:06:40,286 --> 00:06:47,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, to finish how that date went, my car ended up getting shot up and then exploded and then that was the end of that date.

108
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:52,171
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a nice story that could only be told in Grand Theft Auto.

109
00:06:53,232 --> 00:06:53,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else?

110
00:06:55,489 --> 00:06:57,150
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that's all the games I played this week.

111
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, oh, no, I actually did try playing some of the emulators.

112
00:07:00,631 --> 00:07:03,172
[SPEAKER_02]: I played a little bit of Doom on my PSP.

113
00:07:03,332 --> 00:07:05,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you've got to tell us about this in a little bit, the PSP stuff.

114
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:06,774
[SPEAKER_03]: That was big news this week.

115
00:07:07,074 --> 00:07:10,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Real quick, I'll tell you about mine, because I actually didn't get a chance to play a whole lot of new games.

116
00:07:10,575 --> 00:07:12,196
[SPEAKER_03]: I've still been playing WarioWare Twisted.

117
00:07:12,236 --> 00:07:13,876
[SPEAKER_03]: I only really touched the surface of it.

118
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:15,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm really into the game.

119
00:07:15,817 --> 00:07:17,718
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just trying to unlock more souvenirs.

120
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:20,359
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to say, WarioWare graphics...

121
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:49,564
[SPEAKER_03]: typically what you're used to in WarioWare sound is you know again what you'd be used to bleeps and bloops nothing too exciting except there are records that you can unlock which is kind of cool because you can unlock like the old Kid Icarus theme as a record and by the way a big F you to Nintendo because the little caption that shows up when you unlock the Kid Icarus record is it says this is the closest thing to a sequel you're gonna get har har har and I'm like bastards you need to do a Kid Icarus sequel but um

122
00:07:50,245 --> 00:07:56,670
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get records and then you can scratch it using like the twist, you know, because the whole concept of WarioWare Twisted is that you move the thing around, so it's kind of cool.

123
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:57,631
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a lot of fun.

124
00:07:58,031 --> 00:07:58,791
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised.

125
00:07:58,871 --> 00:08:03,475
[SPEAKER_03]: WarioWare Twisted looked kind of dumb to me and I was not a big fan of the twist idea, but...

126
00:08:04,164 --> 00:08:08,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Just goes to show you got to actually sit down and play the game because I'm having a lot of fun with it.

127
00:08:08,085 --> 00:08:10,286
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually really like the twist concept.

128
00:08:10,326 --> 00:08:11,027
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of fun.

129
00:08:11,467 --> 00:08:12,367
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm having fun with the game.

130
00:08:12,387 --> 00:08:13,908
[SPEAKER_03]: So I definitely recommend it.

131
00:08:14,408 --> 00:08:15,228
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to pet the kitty.

132
00:08:16,188 --> 00:08:18,429
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the coolest unlock that you have, Loki.

133
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:24,511
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have this one yet, but the Mutroid or whatever with the cat with the gun that rolls around on its back and shoots things.

134
00:08:24,531 --> 00:08:25,752
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I want to do the pet the kitty.

135
00:08:26,332 --> 00:08:30,054
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a lot of... Well, that was cute, but I want to shoot things with the kitty.

136
00:08:30,194 --> 00:08:31,234
[SPEAKER_01]: We need Ninten cats.

137
00:08:31,499 --> 00:08:36,461
[SPEAKER_02]: They have some other fun stuff in there, like you can unlock mini-golf, like a mini-golf game.

138
00:08:36,481 --> 00:08:38,481
[SPEAKER_02]: You can unlock a batting practice game.

139
00:08:38,942 --> 00:08:40,822
[SPEAKER_02]: You can unlock a ton of stuff.

140
00:08:40,922 --> 00:08:53,386
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the mini-games that are tucked away in there, and I think that's where Twisted is really excelling over Touched, because the mini-games in Touched were kind of eh, which is too bad, because Touched, you know, the stylus thing is such a cool idea.

141
00:08:54,147 --> 00:08:56,507
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised it wasn't utilized, but maybe the game was rushed.

142
00:08:56,547 --> 00:08:56,908
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

143
00:08:57,288 --> 00:08:57,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

144
00:08:57,868 --> 00:08:58,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

145
00:08:59,551 --> 00:09:02,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Loki, some big game news this week.

146
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:15,329
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to let you start off tonight because that PSP hacking is just... When I saw one of my friends playing Legend of Zelda on the PSP, I was just like, there is something really, really wrong with this picture yet so...

147
00:09:16,118 --> 00:09:17,759
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

148
00:09:39,522 --> 00:09:44,665
[SPEAKER_02]: You basically have two memory cards, and one of them can be any memory card size.

149
00:09:44,845 --> 00:09:51,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you put a small little file on there in a directory, and you put that same directory on another memory card.

150
00:09:51,109 --> 00:09:54,311
[SPEAKER_02]: The second memory card is the one that actually has the program on it.

151
00:09:54,692 --> 00:09:58,694
[SPEAKER_02]: So you put the first memory card in, and you load up the program.

152
00:09:58,774 --> 00:10:03,037
[SPEAKER_02]: And while it's loading, you really quickly swap in the one that has the actual program on it.

153
00:10:03,652 --> 00:10:04,453
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.

154
00:10:32,194 --> 00:10:33,239
[SPEAKER_02]: What it's supposed to run at, 333 MHz.

155
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:38,333
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's pretty cool Nintendo stuff.

156
00:10:38,454 --> 00:10:40,495
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't got a Nintendo emulator to work on mine.

157
00:10:40,656 --> 00:10:41,556
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to try it again.

158
00:10:42,057 --> 00:10:46,080
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, it looked like it runs games pretty full speed.

159
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually saw it on one of my friend's PSPs and it looked great.

160
00:10:48,843 --> 00:10:49,483
[SPEAKER_03]: I was impressed.

161
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:50,965
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just, wow.

162
00:10:51,285 --> 00:11:02,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though these games we've played to death, there's just something about having that whole catalog of games opened up, able to play on the go, on a nice looking screen that is just...

163
00:11:02,865 --> 00:11:03,946
[SPEAKER_03]: So neat to me.

164
00:11:04,046 --> 00:11:04,366
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

165
00:11:04,426 --> 00:11:06,007
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes me want a PSP even more.

166
00:11:06,427 --> 00:11:09,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, I was kind of like, yeah, I want a PSP, but what do I really want it for?

167
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,812
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to play Luminous and whatever cool games they release in the future.

168
00:11:12,852 --> 00:11:18,475
[SPEAKER_03]: But now I'm like, wow, with this trick, I could play the old Nintendo catalog and who knows what else.

169
00:11:18,495 --> 00:11:18,756
[SPEAKER_03]: For now.

170
00:11:18,796 --> 00:11:22,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for now until they... When's this story going to come to an end here?

171
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:23,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there...

172
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:32,884
[SPEAKER_02]: They've announced already that you can upgrade your system to a version 1.52 over, you know, you can do a network update, that type of thing.

173
00:11:33,424 --> 00:11:36,406
[SPEAKER_02]: But who's going to do that because they'll stop you from playing it.

174
00:11:36,546 --> 00:11:49,994
[SPEAKER_02]: However, in Japan, the same type of thing is happening with the version 1.0 stuff where they'll upgrade yours to 1.52 by playing certain games and they'll have a firmware update on the actual game and they'll force you to update it in order to play that game.

175
00:11:50,974 --> 00:12:08,378
[SPEAKER_02]: so it kind of sucks but there are ways around it still and people are going to find ways around that too I mean you just watch so it's right now just enjoy it while you have it I mean and avoid those games that will force you to update so that's pretty much it yeah okay we'll see

176
00:12:09,031 --> 00:12:10,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else you want to share really quickly?

177
00:12:10,311 --> 00:12:12,672
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on in the hacking and cracking world or anything?

178
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,933
[SPEAKER_03]: I imagine that's probably the biggest thing that's got everybody's attention right now.

179
00:12:16,013 --> 00:12:17,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's the biggest thing right now.

180
00:12:17,074 --> 00:12:21,955
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got the Heretic WAD works with the Doom thing.

181
00:12:22,015 --> 00:12:30,618
[SPEAKER_02]: But the second thing that actually was just released not too long ago, which is probably within the hour, was the PSP Personalized version 1.0.

182
00:12:31,338 --> 00:12:36,880
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically what that does is you know how the PSP has the wonderful graphics in the background and changes color with the month?

183
00:12:37,469 --> 00:12:38,049
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

184
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Weather stuff they've got coming out.

185
00:12:59,641 --> 00:13:02,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone else is working on a custom boot-up screen video.

186
00:13:02,343 --> 00:13:04,724
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how they have the little PSP screen boot-up thing?

187
00:13:04,865 --> 00:13:10,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now you'll be able to put your own video in there, and that's something that's going to be coming yet again later on.

188
00:13:10,668 --> 00:13:16,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, there is more information released about Liberty City Stories, the Grand Theft Auto version that's going to be coming out.

189
00:13:16,872 --> 00:13:19,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, it's the same stuff we already know.

190
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,896
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not going to be aircraft in it.

191
00:13:22,996 --> 00:13:26,598
[SPEAKER_02]: The main character, Tony, is going to be voiced by Michael Madsen, which is kind of cool.

192
00:13:27,853 --> 00:13:30,134
[SPEAKER_02]: The graphics will be better than Grand Theft Auto 3.

193
00:13:31,214 --> 00:13:34,174
[SPEAKER_02]: New landmarks are going to be available in Liberty City this time.

194
00:13:35,155 --> 00:13:38,975
[SPEAKER_02]: The motorcycles will be in there as well because you can ride motorcycles.

195
00:13:39,215 --> 00:13:41,536
[SPEAKER_02]: And the story will be as long as Vice City.

196
00:13:41,676 --> 00:13:42,796
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not hack and crack news.

197
00:13:43,376 --> 00:13:45,097
[SPEAKER_03]: You snuck that in there just because you're a Grand Theft Auto fan.

198
00:13:45,137 --> 00:13:46,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because I like that stuff.

199
00:13:46,637 --> 00:13:46,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

200
00:13:47,057 --> 00:13:51,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, Genesis Emulator was released for it, so that's kind of neat.

201
00:13:52,038 --> 00:14:13,561
[SPEAKER_02]: and other than that check PSPHacker.com it's a good resource for finding all your homebrew stuff as far as all the brand new releases for the emulators and what not for those of you guys that are going crazy over the PSP news this week PSPHacker.com and they also have their sister site which is DSHacker.com but obviously not as much news going on over there

202
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:15,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Matrix Online is being sold.

203
00:14:40,262 --> 00:14:42,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony Online Entertainment

204
00:14:54,002 --> 00:14:54,983
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm impartial to it.

205
00:14:55,263 --> 00:14:55,983
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really matter.

206
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:59,766
[SPEAKER_01]: What if Matrix Online becomes part of the whole PlayOnline lineup?

207
00:15:00,306 --> 00:15:02,027
[SPEAKER_01]: Because all they have are, what, two games?

208
00:15:02,187 --> 00:15:07,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know if it necessarily becomes PlayOnline because EverQuest is also Sony and it's not a part of PlayOnline.

209
00:15:08,331 --> 00:15:11,593
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I remember right, PlayOnline is specifically half Square as well.

210
00:15:11,793 --> 00:15:12,293
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

211
00:15:12,313 --> 00:15:13,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Square has nothing to do with this.

212
00:15:13,134 --> 00:15:15,415
[SPEAKER_02]: And Square doesn't just have Final Fantasy XI.

213
00:15:15,435 --> 00:15:20,418
[SPEAKER_02]: They have, well, the Count Tetra Master, but they also have Front Mission Online, their other online game that's going to be coming out.

214
00:15:20,438 --> 00:15:22,319
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have a Mahjong game in Japan, I believe.

215
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:22,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

216
00:15:22,739 --> 00:15:23,280
[SPEAKER_03]: From what I remember.

217
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:23,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

218
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,371
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I would do Front Mission Online.

219
00:15:25,831 --> 00:15:26,392
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be fun.

220
00:15:26,452 --> 00:15:27,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming out for consoles.

221
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,555
[SPEAKER_03]: So that should just be interesting.

222
00:15:29,575 --> 00:15:39,303
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Matrix Online, even though we haven't really played it a whole lot and haven't been able to give you a lot of perspective, I kind of think it's neat, some of their ideas, that they have the actual actors playing in the game.

223
00:15:39,383 --> 00:15:40,624
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of neat, I guess.

224
00:15:40,724 --> 00:15:41,244
[SPEAKER_03]: It's different.

225
00:15:41,665 --> 00:15:45,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I can applaud a company that takes different ideas on MMOs and games, so whatever.

226
00:15:46,228 --> 00:15:46,469
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

227
00:15:46,489 --> 00:15:46,589
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

228
00:15:48,636 --> 00:15:52,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on to another story that is just too cool for words.

229
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,339
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so excited about this.

230
00:15:54,640 --> 00:16:01,023
[SPEAKER_03]: This website here, a blogger, I should say, PressTheButtons.com, is reporting that the Super Mario Bros.

231
00:16:01,084 --> 00:16:05,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Show is going to be released on DVD.

232
00:16:05,746 --> 00:16:09,709
[SPEAKER_03]: A complete series of the programs are going to be released on DVD.

233
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:15,392
[SPEAKER_03]: This will include all the Mario cartoons and the Zelda cartoons to be released this October.

234
00:16:15,452 --> 00:16:16,873
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been done before.

235
00:16:17,963 --> 00:16:19,584
[SPEAKER_02]: But with only some episodes.

236
00:16:19,644 --> 00:16:20,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, it was like a best of.

237
00:16:20,925 --> 00:16:27,990
[SPEAKER_03]: So the best of has happened previously, but I suppose due to demand or torrents or whatever, they're going to release the complete series.

238
00:16:28,851 --> 00:16:33,153
[SPEAKER_03]: I am actually considering buying this because I have such fond memories of watching this when I was growing up.

239
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:33,654
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

240
00:16:34,134 --> 00:16:38,117
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about you guys out there, but this show, I remember Friday's Zelda cartoons.

241
00:16:38,537 --> 00:16:40,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, excuse me, princess.

242
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:41,719
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just cool.

243
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Any thoughts, Loki?

244
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Something you'd consider buying or...

245
00:16:44,913 --> 00:16:47,614
[SPEAKER_02]: I was watching the Nintendo Entertainment Serial System thing.

246
00:16:47,654 --> 00:16:48,354
[SPEAKER_02]: That commercial was awful!

247
00:17:09,627 --> 00:17:13,510
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you go back and watch some of those episodes of Mario, some of them were really awful.

248
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:15,812
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Super Mario World ones were really good.

249
00:17:15,832 --> 00:17:17,333
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's Captain Lou.

250
00:17:17,393 --> 00:17:18,113
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Mario.

251
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:18,954
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

252
00:17:19,294 --> 00:17:23,036
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, it's like they made sound effects when they walked.

253
00:17:23,497 --> 00:17:25,098
[SPEAKER_03]: But I thought that was cute.

254
00:17:25,298 --> 00:17:25,738
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

255
00:17:27,139 --> 00:17:27,539
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

256
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you thinking about buying this?

257
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,300
[SPEAKER_03]: You own a ton of DVDs.

258
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Surely you have to add this one to your collection.

259
00:17:33,422 --> 00:17:34,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, probably not.

260
00:17:35,123 --> 00:17:36,724
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working on box sets of stuff.

261
00:17:36,744 --> 00:17:39,026
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to finish the Samurai Troopers set.

262
00:17:39,627 --> 00:17:40,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine, fine.

263
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:42,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Hate on Mario Brothers.

264
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:42,889
[SPEAKER_03]: See if I care.

265
00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:44,851
[SPEAKER_01]: It says that I have all the episodes of Zelda on my computer.

266
00:17:45,371 --> 00:17:45,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

267
00:17:46,352 --> 00:17:47,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, moving on.

268
00:17:48,054 --> 00:17:49,295
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to address real fast.

269
00:17:49,315 --> 00:17:52,597
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys ever have any comments or feedback on the show, you can always send us an email.

270
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:56,420
[SPEAKER_03]: 2go at orangeloungeradio.com is the address.

271
00:17:56,781 --> 00:17:57,181
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh,

272
00:17:57,968 --> 00:17:58,609
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

273
00:18:21,448 --> 00:18:25,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's do a quick follow-up to a story we were talking about a couple weeks ago.

274
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:28,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony is talking about those porno UMDs.

275
00:18:28,912 --> 00:18:32,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember we were talking about a couple weeks ago they're going to release pornos on the PSP?

276
00:18:33,074 --> 00:18:36,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, out of Tokyo, Sony Computer Entertainment

277
00:18:36,826 --> 00:18:45,470
[SPEAKER_03]: They are frowning at this whole thing, calling this stuff, quote, utterly undesirable, but we cannot stop software makers from selling such videos.

278
00:18:46,991 --> 00:18:54,114
[SPEAKER_03]: An interesting thing to note, software releases for the PSP, they have to go through an approval process before they can be released.

279
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:58,996
[SPEAKER_03]: However, the movies on the UMDs do not have to go through an approval process.

280
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:02,178
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the loophole that the porno games are going through, so...

281
00:19:03,508 --> 00:19:05,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy XII, big news is coming from Squeenix

282
00:19:27,721 --> 00:19:31,002
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be doing a party over in Tokyo, their summer gaming event.

283
00:19:31,042 --> 00:19:32,162
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Square Enix Party 2005.

284
00:19:32,883 --> 00:19:37,824
[SPEAKER_03]: It happens July 30 and 31 at the Nippon Convention Center.

285
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:44,346
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's going to happen is that Nobuo Uematsu will actually be there, and he'll be talking about the game and showing off some new footage.

286
00:19:45,206 --> 00:19:48,087
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll also be having some of the voice actors there as well.

287
00:19:48,147 --> 00:19:54,928
[SPEAKER_03]: The music supervisor will be there, and they'll have more new information, including some type of surprise.

288
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:56,449
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys think...

289
00:19:57,366 --> 00:19:58,487
[SPEAKER_03]: You might know any of the surprises.

290
00:19:58,527 --> 00:20:02,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Any guesses what the big Final Fantasy XII surprise could be?

291
00:20:02,749 --> 00:20:03,690
[SPEAKER_03]: You're on candid camera.

292
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,871
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe Final Fantasy V is hidden in the game?

293
00:20:08,252 --> 00:20:09,933
[SPEAKER_01]: Which was the best of them all?

294
00:20:10,553 --> 00:20:18,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, after seeing the footage at E3, the new Final Fantasy XII trailer, because they didn't really show any bits of the game, they only showed the trailer.

295
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:22,348
[SPEAKER_03]: I seriously think it has something to do with an X-Gen system.

296
00:20:22,368 --> 00:20:23,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Surprise!

297
00:20:23,368 --> 00:20:24,509
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cross-gen.

298
00:20:24,589 --> 00:20:26,049
[SPEAKER_02]: It's PS3 and PS2.

299
00:20:26,189 --> 00:20:30,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I think maybe with Final Fantasy XI it could be Xbox 360.

300
00:20:30,231 --> 00:20:39,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, again, I'm speculating, but, you know, maybe it was the PS2, but I was just like, dang, this looks too good to be PS2.

301
00:20:39,314 --> 00:20:42,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but which system had a tech demo for Final Fantasy VII?

302
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:42,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

303
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:44,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, true, true.

304
00:20:45,736 --> 00:20:46,416
[SPEAKER_03]: That, I would...

305
00:20:47,751 --> 00:20:48,812
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my initial thought.

306
00:20:48,852 --> 00:20:51,113
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet it's something minor and who cares about it.

307
00:20:51,153 --> 00:20:53,435
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably just some in-game tactic or something.

308
00:20:53,495 --> 00:20:53,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

309
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:57,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe one of the voice actors has a really big name or the theme song or something.

310
00:20:58,038 --> 00:21:00,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Al Pacino will play the main character.

311
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:02,381
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what though?

312
00:21:02,441 --> 00:21:03,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't that be interesting if it was cross-gen?

313
00:21:03,702 --> 00:21:15,690
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind though, back in the day on the Nintendo 64, they did all the Final Fantasy 6 characters for a tech demo for the Nintendo 64.

314
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,171
[SPEAKER_01]: I vaguely recall this.

315
00:21:18,552 --> 00:21:20,213
[SPEAKER_01]: Square jumped into bed with Sony.

316
00:21:21,294 --> 00:21:21,755
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

317
00:21:22,395 --> 00:21:24,377
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've been fucking around ever since.

318
00:21:26,098 --> 00:21:27,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, am I wrong?

319
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:31,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now Microsoft's getting, you know, coming in and wanting to get their hands on it.

320
00:21:31,483 --> 00:21:35,026
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the background, your cheating heart plays on the jukebox.

321
00:21:37,288 --> 00:21:38,408
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, I don't know.

322
00:21:38,628 --> 00:21:41,329
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just some speculation, you know.

323
00:21:41,709 --> 00:21:45,930
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the record, I would love to find a ROM or something of that demo.

324
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:47,431
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know it exists.

325
00:21:48,211 --> 00:21:50,151
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the one for Robotech Crystal Dreams.

326
00:21:51,211 --> 00:21:51,572
[SPEAKER_01]: Playable.

327
00:21:52,572 --> 00:21:53,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

328
00:21:53,732 --> 00:21:54,712
[SPEAKER_01]: We need more Robotech games.

329
00:21:54,932 --> 00:21:55,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we'll see.

330
00:21:55,652 --> 00:21:57,833
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all we can really do here on the show is speculate.

331
00:21:57,853 --> 00:21:59,133
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just gamers like the rest of you.

332
00:21:59,173 --> 00:22:03,074
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that would be kind of a neat news, though, if it is cross-gen.

333
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:05,895
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think I'm just crazy talk.

334
00:22:07,048 --> 00:22:08,408
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you have a suggestion, send it to us.

335
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:09,129
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's okay.

336
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:09,849
[SPEAKER_01]: We're used to it.

337
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:10,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, whatever.

338
00:22:11,829 --> 00:22:12,110
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

339
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:22,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio, we're not just here to talk about video games all the time, but we're here to better your life because if we talked about games all the time and never went outside, we'd have no time to take over the world.

340
00:22:23,773 --> 00:22:32,036
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are here to bring you some advice to better your life, and who better to bring it to you than the one and only, the huggable Dark Sakura with her advice column.

341
00:22:32,336 --> 00:22:33,436
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you saying I'm cuddly?

342
00:22:34,076 --> 00:22:34,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I am.

343
00:22:35,717 --> 00:22:36,037
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn it.

344
00:22:36,874 --> 00:22:41,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's bit of sage advice is how to treat a broken nose.

345
00:22:42,498 --> 00:22:43,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one.

346
00:22:43,539 --> 00:22:44,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop the bleeding.

347
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Duh.

348
00:22:46,001 --> 00:22:47,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Tilt your head back slightly.

349
00:22:47,802 --> 00:22:52,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Pinch the bridge of your nose closed, the region just below the hard cartilage, not simply the nostrils.

350
00:22:53,066 --> 00:22:55,528
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold a tissue underneath your nostrils to catch the blood.

351
00:22:56,328 --> 00:22:56,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Icky.

352
00:22:57,289 --> 00:22:57,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Two.

353
00:22:58,109 --> 00:22:59,650
[SPEAKER_01]: Apply a cold pack or ice immediately.

354
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:00,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep your head tilted back.

355
00:23:00,871 --> 00:23:03,393
[SPEAKER_01]: Continue to apply ice as needed to keep the swelling down.

356
00:23:04,114 --> 00:23:04,374
[SPEAKER_01]: Three.

357
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:08,051
[SPEAKER_01]: If your nose appears broken or crooked, do not attempt to treat it yourself.

358
00:23:08,671 --> 00:23:13,072
[SPEAKER_01]: The only reason to attempt to relocate the position of the nose is if you are having trouble breathing through your mouth.

359
00:23:14,012 --> 00:23:21,194
[SPEAKER_01]: If you aren't getting any air, you can attempt to relocate the position of your nose so that you can breathe through it, but this will be quite painful.

360
00:23:21,674 --> 00:23:22,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, leave it to the doctor.

361
00:23:23,195 --> 00:23:25,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Four, seek medical attention immediately.

362
00:23:26,215 --> 00:23:28,616
[SPEAKER_01]: But my final, final bit of advice on that one?

363
00:23:28,736 --> 00:23:28,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

364
00:23:29,736 --> 00:23:32,277
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go getting into the bar fights pissed on Miller Lite.

365
00:23:35,694 --> 00:23:36,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Some sage advice there, thank you.

366
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:37,876
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.

367
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:39,317
[SPEAKER_01]: I always give good advice.

368
00:23:39,797 --> 00:23:40,057
[SPEAKER_03]: You do.

369
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:40,758
[SPEAKER_03]: You do.

370
00:23:41,218 --> 00:23:41,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, once in a while.

371
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:43,800
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kidding.

372
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,784
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you never know when you're going to be stuck in Brazil crossing a piranha-infested river, okay?

373
00:23:49,624 --> 00:23:50,745
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know.

374
00:23:51,145 --> 00:23:51,446
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

375
00:23:51,526 --> 00:23:52,847
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just doing that the other week.

376
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:55,789
[SPEAKER_01]: And when was the last time you jumped off the roof of a building?

377
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:57,410
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

378
00:23:58,331 --> 00:23:58,771
[SPEAKER_01]: See?

379
00:23:59,091 --> 00:23:59,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, alright.

380
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:05,076
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I had to stop a runaway camel the other day and I would not have known had I not researched it.

381
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, my bad, I'm sorry.

382
00:24:07,889 --> 00:24:08,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright then.

383
00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:10,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about Mega Man Legends.

384
00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:15,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Loki kind of brought this up briefly last week, but this is hitting the newswire now.

385
00:24:15,231 --> 00:24:20,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Mega Man Legends 2 is coming to the PSP, and it's shipping on September 8th.

386
00:24:21,012 --> 00:24:21,852
[SPEAKER_03]: They have an announced date.

387
00:24:22,172 --> 00:24:26,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, by the way, that's a Japan shipping date, not an American shipping date yet.

388
00:24:26,194 --> 00:24:28,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, why don't they work on Legends 3 while they're at it?

389
00:24:28,814 --> 00:24:31,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I already finished the first two games, and I want more.

390
00:24:33,551 --> 00:24:41,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Mega Man Legends is coming out August 4th for the PSP Breath of Fire 3 on August 25th.

391
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:43,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Direct port to their PlayStation Originals.

392
00:24:44,314 --> 00:24:46,614
[SPEAKER_03]: But they will be reformatted to the widescreen thing.

393
00:24:47,114 --> 00:24:47,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Go figure.

394
00:24:48,675 --> 00:24:50,235
[SPEAKER_03]: So all those games coming out in Japan.

395
00:24:51,295 --> 00:24:52,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully here too.

396
00:24:53,276 --> 00:24:53,856
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll find out.

397
00:24:54,516 --> 00:24:58,517
[SPEAKER_01]: I do believe that there was also a release date for Papakuros.

398
00:24:59,725 --> 00:25:00,866
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't been following that one.

399
00:25:00,926 --> 00:25:03,128
[SPEAKER_01]: I do believe that they said August.

400
00:25:03,408 --> 00:25:03,849
[SPEAKER_01]: September.

401
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,010
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a month difference.

402
00:25:06,451 --> 00:25:07,151
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.

403
00:25:07,452 --> 00:25:14,117
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of you guys that like the music games, by the way, we have some dates for DDR Extreme 2 and DDR Ultramix 3.

404
00:25:15,258 --> 00:25:22,784
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR Extreme 2 is going to be out September the 28th with Extreme 2 on September the 28th and Ultramix 3 I get so confused, on November the 2nd.

405
00:25:28,137 --> 00:25:28,697
[SPEAKER_03]: are those games.

406
00:25:28,917 --> 00:25:31,538
[SPEAKER_03]: But of course, subject to change as all shipping dates are.

407
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:39,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Miyamoto has been talking about Mario 128, you know that official sequel to Mario 64?

408
00:25:39,981 --> 00:25:43,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the hell Super Mario Sunshine was then, but I guess it wasn't an actual sequel.

409
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:49,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Mario 128 is the actual planned sequel, and he has officially said...

410
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:51,575
[SPEAKER_03]: It ain't happening on GameCube.

411
00:25:51,955 --> 00:25:54,896
[SPEAKER_03]: However, they will be doing it on Revolution.

412
00:25:55,356 --> 00:26:01,099
[SPEAKER_03]: The Mario team can't create too many games at the same time, so they are concentrating on the Revolution.

413
00:26:03,024 --> 00:26:03,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Any thoughts on this?

414
00:26:03,824 --> 00:26:04,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Should be some good stuff.

415
00:26:04,904 --> 00:26:06,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Mario 64.

416
00:26:07,185 --> 00:26:17,327
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Mario 64 is slightly overrated in the halls of video game history, but I think it's a fun game and I will certainly be all over a sequel.

417
00:26:17,427 --> 00:26:18,707
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it could be good.

418
00:26:18,767 --> 00:26:23,348
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan and I would play that game together every night for the first few months that I moved out here.

419
00:26:23,668 --> 00:26:25,068
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you think of the DS one, though?

420
00:26:25,088 --> 00:26:27,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you play that at all or was the magic gone by that point?

421
00:26:28,609 --> 00:26:29,649
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in school.

422
00:26:30,734 --> 00:26:31,214
[SPEAKER_01]: Caracuri, Gimmicks

423
00:26:55,342 --> 00:26:57,347
[SPEAKER_03]: and basically it's a puzzle game.

424
00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:04,143
[SPEAKER_03]: The only reason I really bring this up, it seems like puzzle games are the big craze right now on the handheld systems.

425
00:27:05,035 --> 00:27:07,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it all because of Luminous or what's going on?

426
00:27:07,677 --> 00:27:10,439
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all systems, especially the DS.

427
00:27:10,739 --> 00:27:11,380
[SPEAKER_02]: All puzzle games.

428
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:18,725
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny though, try to find a puzzle game that's not on a handheld system that's brand new coming out.

429
00:27:19,186 --> 00:27:20,306
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to find one.

430
00:27:21,047 --> 00:27:21,507
[SPEAKER_02]: At all.

431
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,249
[SPEAKER_03]: On the consoles.

432
00:27:23,329 --> 00:27:25,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Puzzles seem to be big on the handheld now.

433
00:27:25,791 --> 00:27:29,753
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because you can play with other people.

434
00:27:30,194 --> 00:27:33,997
[SPEAKER_01]: The DS itself lends itself very well to the puzzle game

435
00:27:34,898 --> 00:27:35,298
[SPEAKER_01]: Puyo Puyo

436
00:28:03,118 --> 00:28:05,161
[SPEAKER_03]: There's something about having the puzzles on the console.

437
00:28:05,181 --> 00:28:07,644
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just imagine having something like Luminous on the console.

438
00:28:07,664 --> 00:28:08,525
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be so pretty.

439
00:28:09,225 --> 00:28:09,946
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

440
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:10,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's just me.

441
00:28:11,188 --> 00:28:12,630
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can play on the internet and everything.

442
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:13,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh well.

443
00:28:14,591 --> 00:28:20,156
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, lastly tonight, we just have a barrage of stories regarding video game movies.

444
00:28:20,236 --> 00:28:23,439
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's just an utter barrage of stuff going on.

445
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:31,225
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, Hitman is going to be coming to the screen, and Vin Diesel, I believe you actually posted a story on OrangeSenseRadio.com about this.

446
00:28:31,245 --> 00:28:32,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Vin Diesel is playing Hitman.

447
00:28:33,147 --> 00:28:33,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Joy.

448
00:28:34,408 --> 00:28:36,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Should be interesting, certainly.

449
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:38,752
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got to do something with what's left of his career.

450
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:42,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Resident Evil is going to be having some more movies coming out.

451
00:28:42,912 --> 00:28:45,873
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be third and fourth movies.

452
00:28:46,234 --> 00:28:49,615
[SPEAKER_03]: The third movie, by the way, is called Resident Evil Afterlife.

453
00:28:50,276 --> 00:28:54,038
[SPEAKER_03]: And the movie script was written by the original director, Paul Anderson.

454
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:59,300
[SPEAKER_03]: However, he is not currently attached to direct the upcoming film.

455
00:28:59,841 --> 00:29:04,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Mila Jovovich, though, is expected to come back and reprise her role tentatively 2006 for Resident Evil 3.

456
00:29:06,129 --> 00:29:09,552
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen the second one, but I heard that it kind of went really crazy.

457
00:29:10,313 --> 00:29:13,095
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard it wasn't so hot, but I don't really know.

458
00:29:13,135 --> 00:29:14,256
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't follow the games enough.

459
00:29:14,977 --> 00:29:17,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, I don't follow the games enough, for one.

460
00:29:17,639 --> 00:29:18,359
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're okay.

461
00:29:18,439 --> 00:29:21,262
[SPEAKER_03]: I play them, but I'm more into Silent Hill than I am Resident Evil.

462
00:29:21,282 --> 00:29:26,006
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one followed very... I think could have easily fit in with the whole...

463
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:27,385
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

464
00:29:49,367 --> 00:29:53,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Dead or Alive is coming to the big screen.

465
00:29:54,768 --> 00:29:57,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Dead or Alive is being budgeted at $30 million.

466
00:29:57,949 --> 00:30:05,231
[SPEAKER_03]: It's being directed by Hong Kong action film director Corey Yuen, who did Romeo Must Die, which I thought was a very cool movie.

467
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:09,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Producing the movie, Jeremy Bolt, who of course is also tied to the Resident Evil films.

468
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:11,932
[SPEAKER_03]: The movie's script is being written by J.F.

469
00:30:12,112 --> 00:30:14,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Lawton, who did Pretty Woman, of all things.

470
00:30:14,873 --> 00:30:42,447
[SPEAKER_02]: and Seth Gross who did Devour which is an upcoming movie but what we should mention I do want to mention this Kasumi being played by Devon Aoki who was Miho in Sin City Miho and also for those who may not have seen Sin City she was also I believe Kiki which was the hot Asian driver that was in Too Fast Too Furious Suki Suki Kiki Suki who's got Hayabusa

471
00:30:43,726 --> 00:30:51,020
[SPEAKER_03]: They haven't talked about... Actually, it's Kane Kosugi, who is in Godzilla Final Wars, will be Ryu Hayabusa.

472
00:30:51,241 --> 00:30:51,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Ryu.

473
00:30:51,862 --> 00:30:52,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Ryu.

474
00:30:52,103 --> 00:30:52,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, whoop, Ryu.

475
00:30:53,288 --> 00:30:54,749
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my bad pronunciation coming in again.

476
00:30:54,769 --> 00:31:04,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, okay, well, we've got... I was looking earlier at the people playing... Let me name some more here because I have a bunch here.

477
00:31:05,052 --> 00:31:08,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie Presley from Not Another Teen Movie is Tina.

478
00:31:08,713 --> 00:31:12,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Nastassja Malth from Elektra is Ayan.

479
00:31:12,475 --> 00:31:15,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Sarah Carter from Final Destination 2 is Helena.

480
00:31:16,236 --> 00:31:19,257
[SPEAKER_03]: And Australian pop star Holly Valance is...

481
00:31:19,685 --> 00:31:20,405
[SPEAKER_03]: is Christy.

482
00:31:20,485 --> 00:31:22,946
[SPEAKER_03]: She was also in National Lampoon's Pledge This.

483
00:31:24,087 --> 00:31:26,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Professional wrestler Kevin Nash is bass.

484
00:31:27,268 --> 00:31:28,169
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God.

485
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:32,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the thing is, though, is that in the game, though, he looks like Hulk Hogan.

486
00:31:33,311 --> 00:31:35,251
[SPEAKER_01]: But that kind of makes sense.

487
00:31:35,652 --> 00:31:41,574
[SPEAKER_03]: And Brian J. White, who, by the way, is also coming up in a film adaptation of Tekken, is going to be Zack.

488
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:44,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even know they were doing a film adaptation of Tekken.

489
00:31:44,455 --> 00:31:46,176
[SPEAKER_01]: They better have somebody hot playing Gene.

490
00:31:48,464 --> 00:31:50,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I gotta look at the Tekken news.

491
00:31:54,268 --> 00:31:57,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man, all I gotta say is they got one hot cast.

492
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:58,911
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to see this.

493
00:31:59,271 --> 00:32:01,293
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin Nash is in it.

494
00:32:01,533 --> 00:32:02,914
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan's gonna flip.

495
00:32:03,194 --> 00:32:04,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Brian J. White playing Bruce.

496
00:32:05,035 --> 00:32:06,316
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all they've got so far.

497
00:32:08,091 --> 00:32:09,392
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin Nash, wow.

498
00:32:10,153 --> 00:32:13,795
[SPEAKER_01]: He was Diesel back in the WCW days.

499
00:32:13,955 --> 00:32:23,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Tekken is being directed by Charles Stone III, written by Michael Cullery and Mike Werb, whoever the hell those people are.

500
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:28,124
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on video game movie overload, but I saved the best for last, boys and girls.

501
00:32:28,884 --> 00:32:31,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me give you an idea of who Mike Werb is.

502
00:32:31,626 --> 00:32:35,608
[SPEAKER_02]: He did writing on Lara Croft, Tomb Raider, and Face Off.

503
00:32:35,929 --> 00:32:37,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Face Off was a good movie.

504
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:47,777
[SPEAKER_02]: and also Michael did also writing on Lara Croft, Tomb Raider, and Face Off as well.

505
00:32:47,837 --> 00:32:49,198
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of neat.

506
00:32:49,239 --> 00:32:55,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Director Charles Stone III did Mr. 3000, Drumline, and Paid in Full.

507
00:32:56,825 --> 00:32:58,025
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just stuff we've never heard of.

508
00:32:58,966 --> 00:33:00,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I saved the best for last.

509
00:33:00,688 --> 00:33:01,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, guys.

510
00:33:01,448 --> 00:33:02,009
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the best.

511
00:33:03,693 --> 00:33:06,434
[SPEAKER_03]: They're making a movie out of the game Postal.

512
00:33:06,995 --> 00:33:11,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Postal, you remember the very controversial game where, let's see, what's their tagline?

513
00:33:11,978 --> 00:33:16,641
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, I don't know, basically it was just kill people in all the great ways you can.

514
00:33:17,082 --> 00:33:19,183
[SPEAKER_03]: The director who's attached to the Postal movie?

515
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:20,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Uwe Boll.

516
00:33:23,314 --> 00:33:29,705
[SPEAKER_01]: I just saw the most... Why do they keep giving that man work?

517
00:33:29,945 --> 00:33:37,858
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, all he's doing is, I'm going to snatch up all the movie rights possible and make crap and keep churning it out over and over.

518
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:42,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, people, have they watched these movies that have been made?

519
00:33:42,781 --> 00:33:43,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Save your dignity.

520
00:33:44,001 --> 00:33:49,763
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but keep in mind, half of Hollywood's on drugs, and the other half is, you know, lung liquor.

521
00:33:49,783 --> 00:34:01,107
[SPEAKER_03]: This movie game, Uwe Boll, by the way, for those who may not know, famous for his work on the films Alone in the Dark, House of the Dead, and the upcoming Blood Rain.

522
00:34:02,699 --> 00:34:04,321
[SPEAKER_02]: House of the Dead was funny

523
00:34:25,339 --> 00:34:25,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Far Cry

524
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:46,282
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the career video game movie maker, boys and girls.

525
00:34:46,642 --> 00:34:48,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, you know what?

526
00:34:48,363 --> 00:34:51,644
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember back in the day when I thought Mortal Kombat, the movie, kind of sucked.

527
00:34:51,764 --> 00:34:52,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Mortal Kombat Annihilation.

528
00:34:52,945 --> 00:34:54,725
[SPEAKER_02]: It's starting to look pretty good right now, isn't it?

529
00:34:54,805 --> 00:34:56,446
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

530
00:34:56,466 --> 00:35:00,488
[SPEAKER_01]: Mortal Kombat Annihilation is an hour and a half of my life that I really want back.

531
00:35:00,608 --> 00:35:03,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Suddenly that Final Fantasy movie wasn't so bad, was it?

532
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:04,870
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the Final Fantasy movie was good.

533
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,492
[SPEAKER_01]: But it wasn't Final Fantasy.

534
00:35:08,132 --> 00:35:09,814
[SPEAKER_01]: But as a movie, it was good.

535
00:35:09,834 --> 00:35:11,495
[SPEAKER_03]: It should have been Alien 5.

536
00:35:11,555 --> 00:35:13,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's what it's got to come up with, though.

537
00:35:13,037 --> 00:35:15,078
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Rob, it's like this.

538
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:23,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you've got a movie coming out this fall, Doom, starring The Rock or whatever.

539
00:35:23,886 --> 00:35:26,028
[SPEAKER_02]: This has the potential to be pretty good.

540
00:35:26,108 --> 00:35:27,269
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that and the Halo movie.

541
00:35:27,728 --> 00:35:30,170
[SPEAKER_02]: What we need is good video game movies to come out.

542
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:33,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I am so not interested in a Halo movie.

543
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:36,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Love the game, I just, I know that a movie will ruin it.

544
00:35:36,994 --> 00:35:38,375
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not interested in the movie.

545
00:35:38,395 --> 00:35:39,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, okay, well fine, fine.

546
00:35:39,175 --> 00:35:40,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe not that, but like Spy Hunter.

547
00:35:40,836 --> 00:35:42,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, these movies, they'll be okay.

548
00:35:42,897 --> 00:35:45,799
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be, they could be good, okay?

549
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:46,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Could be.

550
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:46,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Could be.

551
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Could be.

552
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,221
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big if.

553
00:35:49,301 --> 00:35:51,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, assuming Doom is good, okay?

554
00:35:51,603 --> 00:35:53,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Assuming the Doom movie is good.

555
00:35:54,164 --> 00:36:00,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully people will say, okay, this is what they could be and not let Ui Bol direct anything ever again.

556
00:36:00,287 --> 00:36:04,229
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, Ui Bol should be... I want to put a hit out on Ui Bol.

557
00:36:04,269 --> 00:36:05,029
[SPEAKER_01]: No, stop.

558
00:36:05,929 --> 00:36:08,030
[SPEAKER_01]: This is downloadable by anybody on the internet.

559
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:08,571
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go there.

560
00:36:08,591 --> 00:36:11,712
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to do a movie version of Hell and have Dennis Hopper in it.

561
00:36:12,292 --> 00:36:12,773
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

562
00:36:13,273 --> 00:36:15,674
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, you know Land of the Dead's coming out and he's in it.

563
00:36:17,799 --> 00:36:21,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Movie Bowl is like the video game version of M. Night Shyamalan.

564
00:36:21,162 --> 00:36:24,365
[SPEAKER_01]: He was just like, Hey, don't insult M. Night Shyamalan.

565
00:36:24,405 --> 00:36:25,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't insult him.

566
00:36:25,586 --> 00:36:26,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

567
00:36:26,407 --> 00:36:28,469
[SPEAKER_03]: So what if the ending of Signs was crap?

568
00:36:28,529 --> 00:36:29,350
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen Signs.

569
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:31,492
[SPEAKER_03]: The Village was pretty good.

570
00:36:31,532 --> 00:36:32,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Signs was not crap.

571
00:36:32,353 --> 00:36:33,814
[SPEAKER_03]: The Village was retarded.

572
00:36:33,894 --> 00:36:34,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I like The Village.

573
00:36:34,815 --> 00:36:35,596
[SPEAKER_01]: The Village was...

574
00:36:36,136 --> 00:36:37,357
[SPEAKER_01]: An intelligent movie.

575
00:36:37,497 --> 00:36:38,677
[SPEAKER_03]: I like The Village, you should.

576
00:36:38,837 --> 00:36:39,938
[SPEAKER_01]: It required thought.

577
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:40,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.

578
00:36:40,618 --> 00:36:44,100
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't figure out what the plot twist was going to be about five minutes into the movie.

579
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Suddenly, Orange Lounge Radio has turned into the movie poop shoot.

580
00:36:46,961 --> 00:36:47,341
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

581
00:36:47,481 --> 00:36:49,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Movie poop shoot to go.

582
00:36:50,943 --> 00:36:55,485
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's time to end this episode so we can go beat up Loki.

583
00:36:55,525 --> 00:36:56,045
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that sound?

584
00:36:56,485 --> 00:36:57,366
