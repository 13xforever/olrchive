how very random what's on your mind I've been moving and changing cat litter fun

11
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:00,560
Oh my life is a never-ending swirl of dust. I feel like I'm in Kansas

12
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,560
I thought maybe you were finding cat poo in very hideous places

13
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,680
That would be a cat who would be in a lot of trouble. All right

14
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:15,120
I'll start joining us the one and only infamous Loki. I'll take the contents of my wallet for 500 Alex

15
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,560
No, all right anyways

16
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,800
How you doing? I'm hungry. I mean I haven't eaten since 2 p.m.

17
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:29,080
and it's now like what seven hours later well you could have some damn I don't

18
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,840
want any damn damn by the way is the candy I got at IKEA that looks like

19
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,120
Heath bars it's kind of been a running gag all night long on our three hour

20
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,520
program that we do on Sunday nights via orange launch radio.com they would know

21
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,560
that if they were listening so I've been I've been you know passing my time by

22
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:50,120
you know grading sedans grading sedans grading sedans how so like cheese oh I

23
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:56,540
I know what you're talking about because I great SUVs the one and only warioware twisted. I just have nerves that get graded. I

24
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:03,220
Also found that there's one game in there. That's completely easy to play and you can get like infinite levels on

25
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,200
Because it requires you to do nothing

26
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,060
It's awesome

27
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,760
Anyways

28
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,560
All right, well, let's get to the games that you've been playing this week because we always do this every week

29
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,980
Just kind of give you a pulse on what real gamers at least I think that's what we were considered are up to so let's

30
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,220
Start with Dark Sakura. What do you blame mind games with my fiancee? I mean

31
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:34,660
That's just required part of being engaged to a guy. I haven't really had a lot of time to play any games

32
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:42,140
Except I did play some PSO this week. I had forgotten I did play some PSO. Well, I thought blue burst beta closed

33
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,140
Are you talking about Xbox paying? Oh

34
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:49,980
Oh, it's a bloopers. There was no I thought there was gonna be a gap between oh it went live. Hey cool

35
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:56,620
So I've had paid on Monday and played on Wednesday his bloopers gonna be sold over the counter over the counter

36
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:00,420
I think download it's only download think it's only download. That's kind of interesting

37
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:05,140
Different way of marketing I guess. Oh, yeah, and it's only like nine dollars a month. So it's really cheap

38
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,680
That's how puzzle pirates started to though is only download. So

39
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,360
Interesting, excuse me. That's all right. Sometimes that real life stuff gets in the way

40
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,860
um

41
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,760
Dan's been playing a lot of initial D ever since I got my car

42
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,300
For those who don't know I have a 2002 Mitsubishi Lancer OZ rally now

43
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,820
He's talking about getting an evolution. So he's been going crazy on initial D on ps2

44
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,940
making

45
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:33,700
Evolutions he's playing an evo 7 right now. So I can imagine you are probably sick of eurobeat at this point

46
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:38,340
I can you're a beat and he comes in my car and drives it and makes me listen to eurobeat

47
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:44,240
I'm like no no no he doesn't realize he does realize that your Lancer is not initial D, right?

48
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:50,800
He got challenged to a race though. I got challenged to a race. I'm like turn

49
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,460
My mic I have a 2.0. There's no way

50
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:02,260
Alright, Loki would have smoked the little piece of crap civic hybrid that was challenging me

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,600
Why why do people do that seriously get a life?

52
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,600
Loki, what have you been up to game wise?

53
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:15,600
The reason why they do that is because they see movies like Too Fast Too Furious and Fast and the Furious and the Insert Racing movie here.

54
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,600
That's because they're stupid.

55
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,600
Anyways, I've been playing Wario War Twisted today.

56
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,600
I'm trying to unlock all the wonderful goodies there and there's tons to unlock.

57
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:40,600
to unlock. So I just keep playing. And then also I've been playing Grand Theft Auto San Andreas for the PC. And the graphics are much better in that. And plus all the mods you can do to it are a lot of fun.

58
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:50,600
So I've been passing my time. But the controls, the only thing that pisses me off is the camera doesn't change with you when you turn in the PC version. So you have to adjust the camera with the mouse at the same time.

59
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,600
time it's not very convenient for me so I need to find a way to get it to move

60
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,520
the camera with it or something so I can actually play the game other than that

61
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,680
Did you try the special mod? I haven't gotten to that yeah I tried to take her out on a date

62
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,880
and she wanted to um you know do a drive-by because that's what you do on

63
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:15,840
dates in Los Santos I guess and so I did some I thought that sex mod was a load

64
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,540
of crap. No. No. No. Oh. I showed you the stuff from that one. I thought it was shown

65
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:26,880
to be a photoshop or something. No. It was real. I have video. I have video of it. It's

66
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,640
not a photoshop. Weird. Alright. Alright. Well, in other news also. It doesn't surprise

67
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:37,920
me, sadly. In other news, that mod, they've made it for the Playstation 2 and Xbox versions

68
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:43,340
of the game. You can get patches for it. Anyways. People will see their boobies no matter what

69
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:49,180
it takes well huh I guess people want boobies that's what it takes anyways um

70
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:54,340
so yeah I've been playing that today I what did I do in the game today today I

71
00:05:54,340 --> 00:06:01,060
had an army of I put in the slut magnet code and that is the literal thing what

72
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,980
happens is it's basically like a theme you have an army of sluts carrying

73
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:09,900
dildos and vibrators and they are chasing after you meanwhile you are in a

74
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:17,580
gimp outfit with a dildo and yeah I was killing people with the dildo oh and I

75
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,180
went through and I adjusted the damage rates for each weapon stuff so my

76
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,380
spray-paint was like is like pure anthrax or something because it was

77
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:30,820
instant death for everything that you know basically touched it it was a lot

78
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:40,180
of fun yeah and we wonder why parents complain about these games I whatever

79
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,860
yeah the finish how that date went my car ended up getting shot up and then

80
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,500
exploded and then that was the end of that dance that's that's a nice story

81
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:56,220
they could only be told in Grand Theft Auto anything else I believe that's all

82
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,720
the games I played this week oh no I actually did try playing some of the

83
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,200
emulators. I played a little bit Doom on my PSP. Well you gotta tell us about this

84
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,800
a little bit, the PSP stuff. That was big news this week. Real quick, I'll tell you

85
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,080
about mine, because I actually didn't get a chance to play a whole lot of new

86
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,320
games. I've still been playing WarioWare Twisted. I only really touched the

87
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:17,040
surface of it. Now I'm really into the game. I'm just trying to unlock more

88
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:22,520
souvenirs. I gotta say, WarioWare graphics, typically what you're used to in WarioWare.

89
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,000
Sound is, you know, again what you'd be used to. Bleeps and bloops, nothing too

90
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,260
exciting except there are records that you can unlock which is kind of cool

91
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,720
because you can unlock like the old Kid Icarus theme as a record and by the way

92
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,120
a big F you to Nintendo because the little caption that shows up when you

93
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,760
unlock the Kid Icarus record is it says this is the closest thing to a sequel

94
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,760
you're gonna get hahaha and I'm like past hurts you need to do a Kid Icarus

95
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:53,380
sequel but you can get records then you can scratch it using like the twist you

96
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,800
know because the whole concept of Oriortress is that you move the thing

97
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,320
around so it's kind of cool so it's a lot of fun I I'm surprised warrior wear

98
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,400
twisted looked kind of dumb to me and I was not a big fan of the twist idea but

99
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,960
just goes to show you got to actually sit down and play the game because I'm

100
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,640
having a lot of fun with it I actually really like the twist concept it's a lot

101
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,820
of fun so I'm having fun with the game I definitely recommend it I want to pet

102
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:19,040
the kitty I that was the coolest unlock that you have Loki I don't have this one

103
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,400
yet but the mute roid or whatever with the cat with a gun that rolls around on

104
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,100
its back and shoots things. No, I don't want to do the pet, the kitty. They have a lot of...

105
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:31,440
Well, that was cute, but I want to shoot things with the kitty. We need Nintendcats.

106
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,400
They have some other fun stuff in there, like you can unlock a mini golf,

107
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,880
like a mini golf game, you can unlock a batting practice game,

108
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,320
you can unlock a ton of stuff. I love the mini games that are tucked away in there and I

109
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,040
think that's where Twisted is really

110
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,400
excelling over Touched because the mini games in Touched were kinda

111
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,440
eh, which is too bad because Touched, you know, it's got a...

112
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,840
The stylus thing is such a cool idea.

113
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,440
I'm surprised it wasn't utilized,

114
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,240
but maybe the game was rushed, I don't know.

115
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,400
Who knows, who knows?

116
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,860
All right, Loki, some big game news this week.

117
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,080
I'm gonna let you start off tonight

118
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,280
because that PSP hacking is just,

119
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,080
when I saw one of my friends playing Legend of Zelda

120
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,020
on the PSP, I was just like,

121
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,700
there is something really, really wrong with this picture,

122
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:19,220
yet so satisfying as somebody who loves retro games.

123
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,060
What happened, what's up?

124
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:25,280
Basically, like I mentioned last week, the whole rumor that there was going to be a PSP

125
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:32,600
homebrew on version 1.5 PSPs, well, it apparently was real, so, um, reality, basically the way

126
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:38,120
it works is it's a swap trick, kind of a throwback to the old PlayStation swap trick, basically

127
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,480
you load, you form, basically you have two memory cards, and one of them, it can be any

128
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,880
memory card size, you know, basically you put a small little file on there in a directory,

129
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,800
And you put that same directory on another memory card.

130
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,740
The second memory card is the one that actually has the program on it.

131
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,580
So you put the first memory card in and you load up the program and while it's loading

132
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:04,520
you really quickly swap in the one that has the actual program on it and then it runs

133
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,880
the game.

134
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,680
And so far they've gotten tons of stuff for it because all that same week you have Doom

135
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,680
coming out.

136
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:17,860
They ported the PC version of Doom to the PSP as well as your emulators and this game

137
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,240
called Beats of Rage and just a bunch of homebrew stuff.

138
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:26,480
So you can actually play Super Nintendo games on it, emulations a little bit slow still

139
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,840
but you know they're working on it.

140
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:33,920
You can actually use the program to overclock your PSP to what it's supposed to run at,

141
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,640
333MHz.

142
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,880
And you know it's pretty cool Nintendo stuff, I haven't gotten the Nintendo emulator to

143
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:45,800
work on mine, I gotta try it again, but I mean it looked like it runs games pretty full

144
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,800
speed.

145
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
I actually saw it on one of my friend's PSPs and it looked great.

146
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,800
I was impressed.

147
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,400
It was just, wow.

148
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:56,080
Even though these games we've played to death, there's just something about having that whole

149
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:02,920
catalog of games opened up, able to play on the go, on a nice looking screen that is just

150
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,000
so neat to me.

151
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I don't know.

152
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,560
It makes me want a PSP even more.

153
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,760
Right now I was kind of like, eh, yeah, I want a PSP, but what do I really want it for?

154
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,920
I want to play Luminous and whatever cool games they release in the future.

155
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,680
But now I'm like, oh wow, with this trick I can play the old Nintendo catalog and who

156
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,680
knows what else.

157
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,680
For now?

158
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,520
Yeah, for now until they, when's this story going to come to an end here?

159
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:30,960
Well, they've announced already that you can upgrade your system to a version 1.52 over,

160
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,560
you can do a network update, that type of thing.

161
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,400
But who's going to do that because it'll stop you from playing it.

162
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:50,400
However, in Japan, the same type of thing is happening with the version 1.0 stuff, where they'll upgrade yours to 1.52 by playing certain games, and they'll have a firmware update on the actual game, and they'll force you to update it in order to play that game.

163
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:58,400
So, it kinda sucks, but there are ways around it still, and people are gonna find ways around that too. I mean, you just watch, so...

164
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:04,440
It's right now. I just enjoy it while you have it. I mean and avoid those games that'll force it updates

165
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,720
So that's pretty much it. Yeah, okay

166
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,720
Anything else you want to share really quickly what's going on in the hacking and cracking world or anything?

167
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,880
I imagine that's probably the biggest thing. It's got everybody's attention right now. That's the biggest thing right now

168
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,460
they've got um, the heretic wad works with the

169
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,740
Doom thing but the second thing that actually was just released not too long ago. It's probably within the hour

170
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:36,740
was the PSP personalized version 1.0 and basically what that does is you know how the PSP has the wonderful graphics in the background that changes color with the month?

171
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,740
Well now you can import your own graphics into it using this program.

172
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,740
That's kind of cool.

173
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:47,740
So that's kind of neat. I mean those people, everyone likes to customize their PSPs so this is another way to do it.

174
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,740
You can make your PSP as ugly as your MySpace page if you want.

175
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:58,740
Exactly, and so they have that available right now as well as, let's see here, weather stuff they've got coming out.

176
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:04,740
Someone else is working on a custom boot up screen video, you know how they have the little PSP screen boot up thing?

177
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,740
Well now you'll be able to put your own video in there and that's something that's going to be coming yet again later on.

178
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:16,740
And also there is more information released about Liberty City Stories, the Grand Theft Auto version that's going to be coming out.

179
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:22,340
basically just the same stuff we already know there's not going to be aircraft in

180
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:26,260
it the main character Tony is gonna be voiced by Michael Madsen which is kind

181
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:31,940
of cool the graphics will be better than Grand Theft Auto 3 new landmarks are

182
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:36,220
going to be available in Liberty City this time the motorcycles will be in

183
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:40,140
there as well because you know you can ride motorcycles and story will be as

184
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:44,300
long as Vice City that's not hacking crack news you snuck that in there just

185
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:51,300
Yeah, I like that stuff. Anyways, Genesis emulator was released for it, so that's kind of neat.

186
00:13:51,300 --> 00:14:02,300
And other than that, check out PSPhacker.com, it's a good resource for finding all your homebrew stuff as far as all the brand new releases for the emulators and whatnot.

187
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,300
For those of you guys that are going crazy over the PSP news this week.

188
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:09,380
Yeah, PSPhacker.com and they also have their sister site which is

189
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:13,660
dshacker.com but obviously not as much news going on over there.

190
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,780
Alright, well let's get to some gaming news what's going on this week.

191
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:21,680
First off, a story about the Matrix Online. This is a game you played for

192
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,980
what about a week, Loki, or what?

193
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,900
A week, I got tired of it. Well, something may change here soon because Matrix

194
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,260
Online is rumored to be sold to Sony

195
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:35,240
Online Entertainment. More developments to come, I'm not sure if this was

196
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,840
finalized or what but it's pretty strong rumor here that the matrix online is

197
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:43,680
being sold over to Sony online entertainment yeah most of monoliths

198
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,040
employees are being laid off and so monolith is getting out of the online

199
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,800
game business that's why it's being sold what do you think good news bad news I

200
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,120
don't care news I'm impartial to it it doesn't really matter

201
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,680
did matrix online because part of the whole play online lineup because all

202
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,640
they have are what two games well I don't necessarily becomes play online

203
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,620
because EverQuest is also Sony and it's not a part of Play Online and if I

204
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:12,480
remember I Play Online is specifically Half Square as well. That's true. Square

205
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,720
has nothing to do with this. Square doesn't just have Final Fantasy 11, they have Wolfie, Cal and Tetra

206
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,000
Master, but they also have Front Mission Online, their other online game that's

207
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,960
gonna be coming out. And they have a Mahjong game in Japan I believe. Yeah. From what I

208
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,920
remember. Yeah. Dude, I would do Front Mission Online. That would be fun. Coming out for

209
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:31,160
consoles. So that should just be interesting. You know, Matrix Online, even though we

210
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,760
haven't really played it a whole lot and haven't been able to give you a lot of

211
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,380
perspective. I kind of think it's neat, some of their ideas, that they have the

212
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:41,360
actual actors playing in the game. It's kind of neat, I guess. It's different. I

213
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,400
can applaud a company that takes different ideas on MMOs and games, so

214
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:51,440
whatever. That's cool. Let's move on to another story that is just too cool for

215
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,940
words. I'm so excited about this. This website here, a blogger, I should say

216
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:02,240
pressthebuttons.com is reporting that the Super Mario Brothers Super Show is

217
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,480
is going to be released on DVD.

218
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,960
A complete series of the programs are going to be released on DVD. This would

219
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,080
include all the Mario cartoons

220
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,440
and the Zelda cartoons to be released this October.

221
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,600
This has been done before, but with only some episodes.

222
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,760
Right, it was like a best of. So the best of has happened previously, but I suppose

223
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,920
due to demand or torrents or whatever,

224
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,280
they're gonna release the complete series. I am actually considering buying

225
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,420
this because I have such fond memories of watching this when I was growing up I don't

226
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:37,480
know I don't know about you guys out there but this show just I remember Friday Zelda

227
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:43,940
cartoons well excuse me princess it was just cool any thoughts Loki something you'd consider

228
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:48,720
buying or no I'm trying to find the story there's something that sort of reminded me

229
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:56,600
of this actually there's some brand new site out there that has all of the old video game

230
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,280
commercials uh-huh I've heard of that site yeah yeah so that was one I thought

231
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:06,160
mentioned I was watching the Nintendo Entertainment cereal system Nintendo

232
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,760
it's your breakfast commercial is awful and if you watch some of those episodes

233
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,280
of Mario some of them were really awful but the Super Mario World ones are

234
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:21,440
really good it's Captain Lou it's Mario I know but still it's like they made

235
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:27,140
sound effects when they walked but I thought that was cute I don't know all

236
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:31,660
right well are you thinking about buying this you own a ton of DVDs surely you

237
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:36,060
have to add this one to your collection probably not I've been working on box

238
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:41,740
sets of stuff I need to finish the samurai troopers set fine fine hate on

239
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,840
Mario Brothers see if I said that I have all the episodes is old on my computer

240
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,860
all right um moving on I just wanted to dress real fast if you guys ever have

241
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,540
any comments or feedback on the show you can always send us an email to go at

242
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:58,860
orange lounge radio.com is the address and the one only dark soccer likes to

243
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:05,980
check that box once in a while and well but she's she's warm and friendly and

244
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:11,820
when she checks that yeah you get the real me not the we've given shot who has

245
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:15,820
been worn out by the week and has been moving boxes maybe I should check it

246
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:21,660
this week maybe that's all right that's okay I do it at work anyway all right

247
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,820
let's do a quick follow-up to a story we were talking about a couple weeks ago

248
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:29,980
Sony is talking about those porno UMDs remember we were talking about a couple

249
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:35,260
weeks ago they're gonna release pornos on the PSP well out of Tokyo Sony

250
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:39,220
computer entertainment they are frowning at this whole thing calling this stuff

251
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:44,640
quote utterly undesirable but we cannot stop software makers from selling such

252
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:51,000
videos hmm an interesting thing to note software releases for the PSP they have

253
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,160
to go through an approval process before they could be released however the

254
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,560
movies on the UMDs do not have to go through an approval process this is the

255
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:05,440
loophole that the porno games are going through so it kind of you know what game

256
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,000
company is gonna come out and say great bring on the porn to our system so it's

257
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,720
this is kind of obvious and you know what's gonna happen but any thoughts on

258
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:19,360
the porno on the PSP they're gonna find a way anyway if it's not via UMD they're

259
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,560
gonna put it on their memory stick might as well make a buck off it huh Final

260
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:28,880
Fantasy 12 big news is coming from Squeenix they're gonna be doing a party

261
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,040
over in Tokyo their summer gaming event it's the Square Enix party 2005 it

262
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:39,560
happens July 30 and 31 at the Nippon Convention Center and what's gonna

263
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,360
happen is that Nobuo Uematsu will actually be there and he'll be talking

264
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,440
about the game and showing off some new footage they'll also be having some of

265
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,520
the voice actors there as well the music supervisor will be there and they'll

266
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:56,800
have more new information including some type of surprise you guys think you

267
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:01,560
might know what any of the surprise any guesses what the big Final Fantasy 12

268
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:06,600
surprise could be? You're on candid camera? Maybe Final Fantasy 5 is hidden in the

269
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:13,560
game which was the best of them all I seriously after seeing the footage at e3

270
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,480
the new Final Fantasy 12 trailer because they didn't really show any bits of the

271
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,360
game they only showed the trailer I seriously think it has something to do

272
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:27,880
with the next-gen system I prize it's cross-gen it's ps3 and ps2 I or I think

273
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,520
maybe with the father is 11 it could be Xbox 360 now again I'm speculating but I

274
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:38,020
I you know maybe it was cube maybe it was the ps2 but I I was just like dang

275
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:42,840
this looks too good to be a system had a tech demo for Final Fantasy 7 oh yeah

276
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:49,620
oh true true I I that I would that's my initial thought I bet it's something

277
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:53,520
minor and who cares about it is probably just some in-game tactic or something I

278
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,580
don't know or maybe one of the voice actors it's a really big name or the

279
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:00,900
theme song or something but Al Pacino will play the main character just

280
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:09,740
You know what though, keep in mind though, back in the day on the Nintendo 64, they did

281
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:18,820
all the Final Fantasy 6 characters for a tech demo for the Nintendo 64, and then Square

282
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,460
jumped into bed with Sony.

283
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,460
That's true.

284
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,860
And they've been fucking around ever since.

285
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:27,640
Well am I wrong?

286
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,520
Well now Microsoft's getting, you know, coming in and wanting to get their hands on it.

287
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,920
And in the background your cheating heart plays on the jukebox.

288
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:42,400
I don't know, I don't know, that's just some speculation, you know, and for the record

289
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,840
I would love to find a ROM or something of that demo, because I know it exists.

290
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,720
I've got the one for Robotech Crystal Dreams, playable.

291
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,720
Very cool.

292
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,080
We need more Robotech games.

293
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,120
we'll see that's all we can really do here on the show speculator we're just

294
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,840
gamers like the rest of you so I I think that would be kind of a neat news though

295
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:07,480
if it is cross-gen but I think I I think I'm just crazy talk but if you have a

296
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,200
suggestion send it to us that's okay we're used to it yeah whatever all right

297
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,220
orange lounge radio we're not just here to talk about video games all the time

298

but we're here to better your life because if we talked about games all the

299
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:24,480
time and never went outside we'd have no time to take over the world so we are

300

302
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,040
Are you saying I'm cuddly?

303
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,040
Yes I am.

304
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,040
Damn it.

305
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:42,440
Today's a bit of sage advice is how to treat a broken nose.

306
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,040
Number one, stop the bleeding.

307
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,040
Duh.

308
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,880
Tilt your head back slightly.

309
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,680
Pinch the bridge of your nose closed, the region just below the hard cartilage, not

310
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,680
simply the nostrils.

311
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,680
Hold a tissue underneath your nostrils to catch the blood.

312
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,680
Icky.

313
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,680
2.

314
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,680
Apply a cold pack or ice immediately.

315
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,680
Keep your head tilted back.

316
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,680
Continue to apply ice as needed to keep the swelling down.

317
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,680
3.

318
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:08,680
If your nose appears broken or crooked, do not attempt to treat it yourself.

319
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:13,680
The only reason to attempt to relocate the position of the nose is if you are having trouble breathing through your mouth.

320
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:19,680
If you aren't getting any air, you can attempt to relocate the position of your nose so that you can breathe through it,

321
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,680
but this will be quite painful.

322
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:28,900
Otherwise leave it to the doctor for sick medical attention immediately, but my final final bit of advice on that one. Yes

323
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:32,180
Don't go getting into the bar fights pissed on Miller Lite

324
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:41,940
Some sage advice there. Thank you. You're welcome. I always give good advice. You do you do well once in a while

325
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:48,940
Just kidding. You know, you never know you're gonna be stuck in Brazil crossing a piranha infested river. Okay, you

326
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,940
You never know.

327
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,940
I know, I was just doing that the other week.

328
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,940
And when was the last time you jumped off the roof of the building?

329
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,940
Okay. See?

330
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,940
Alright, alright.

331
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:04,940
And you know, I had to stop a runaway camel the other day and I would not have known how to not research it.

332
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,940
Alright. My bad, I'm sorry.

333
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,940
Alright then.

334
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,940
Let's talk about Mega Man Legends.

335
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,940
Now, Loki kind of brought this up briefly last week, but this is hitting the news wire now.

336
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:20,940
Mega Man Legends 2 is coming to the PSP, and it's shipping on September 8th.

337
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,940
They have an announce date.

338
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:25,940
Oh, by the way, that's a Japan shipping date, not an American shipping date yet.

339
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,940
Good, why don't they work out in Legends 3 while they're at it?

340
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,940
Because I already finished the first two games, and I want more.

341
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:40,940
Mega Man Legends is coming out on August 4th for the PSP Breath of Fire 3 on August 25th.

342
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,940
Direct port to their PlayStation originals.

343
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,520
But they will be reformatted to the widescreen thing go figure

344
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,280
So all those games coming out in Japan

345
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,880
Hopefully here, too

346
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,760
We'll find out. I do believe that they also there's also a release date for papacros. I

347
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,120
Haven't been following that. I do believe that they said August

348
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,640
December September and

349
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:09,520
New as a month difference very cool right there for those of you guys that like the music games, by the way

350
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:14,800
We have some dates for DDR Extreme 2 and DDR Ultra Mix 3.

351
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:23,400
DDR Extreme 2 is going to be out September the 28th with Extreme 2 on September the 28th

352
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:29,000
and Ultra Mix 3, I get so confused, on November the 2nd are those games.

353
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,320
But of course, subject to change as all shipping dates are.

354
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,640
Miyamoto has been talking about Mario 128.

355
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,960
You know that official sequel to Mario 64?

356
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,480
I don't know what the hell Super Mario Sunshine was then, but I guess it wasn't an actual

357
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,600
sequel.

358
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,780
Mario 128 is the actual planned sequel, and he has officially said it ain't happening

359
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,780
on GameCube.

360
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:55,400
However, they will be doing it on Revolution.

361
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:00,200
The Mario team can't create too many games at the same time, so they are concentrating

362
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,120
on the Revolution.

363
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,120
Any thoughts on that?

364
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:10,680
some good stuff. I love Mario 64. I think Mario 64 is slightly overrated in the

365
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:16,200
halls of video game history, but I think it's a fun game and I will certainly be

366
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,160
all over a sequel. I think it could be good. Dan and I would play that game

367
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,880
together every night for the first few months that I moved out here. What did

368
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,640
you think of the DS one, though? Did you play that at all, or was the magic gone by that

369
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:33,360
point? I was in school taking a bunch of classes that required a lot of attention,

370
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,680
So, no, I didn't play it.

371
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:41,040
Tecmo is going to be getting into the PSP world by doing their very first puzzle action

372
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,040
handheld game.

373
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,200
It's actually their first PSP release, I'm sorry, not necessarily their first puzzle

374
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,240
action game, but it's going to be their first PSP release, and it is a puzzle action game,

375
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:58,320
and it's called Karakuri, roughly translated to gimmicks, and basically it's a puzzle game.

376
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,600
The only reason I really bring this up, it seems like puzzle games are the big craze

377
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:07,240
right now on the handheld systems is it all because of luminous or what's going

378
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:12,600
on it's all systems especially the DS all puzzle games it's funny though try

379
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:18,080
to find a puzzle game mmm that's not on a handheld system that's brand-new

380
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,680
coming out you're not gonna find one at all on the on the consoles yeah

381
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,720
consoles puzzle seem to be big on the handheld now well that's because you

382
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:32,560
know it's you can play with other people the DS itself lends itself very well

383
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:37,720
well to the puzzle game genre, especially like with Pac-Pix lately.

384
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:44,740
Pac-Pix is so unique, I need to pick that up, but you know, I've been playing at E3,

385
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:48,400
every time I was in a line for something, out came Puyo Puyo.

386
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,560
I'm addicted to Puyo Puyo.

387
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,520
Okay, alright, makes sense.

388
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,680
Ever since the days of Kirby's Avalanche.

389
00:27:54,680 --> 00:28:01,000
It does make sense in the fact that, you know, puzzles are portable and it's easy to just

390
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,120
play for a few seconds and what have you but there's something about having the

391
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,880
puzzles on the console I mean just imagine having something like luminous

392
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,400
on the console could be so pretty I don't know maybe it's just me you can

393
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:16,320
play on the internet and everything oh alright lastly tonight we just have a

394
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,240
barrage of stories regarding video game movies I mean there's just an utter

395
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:27,080
barrage of stuff going on first off hitman is gonna be coming to the screen

396
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:31,120
and Vin Diesel. I believe you actually posted a story on orangeonsradio.com

397
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:37,180
Vin Diesel is playing hitman. Joy. Should be interesting. Certainly. He's got to do

398
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:41,760
something with what's left of his career. Resident Evil is gonna be having some

399
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,960
more movies coming out. There will be third and fourth movies. The third movie

400
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,320
by the way is called Resident Evil Afterlife and the movie script was

401
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:56,680
written by the original director Paul Anderson. However, he is not currently

402
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:01,520
attached to direct the upcoming film Mila Jovovich though is expected to come

403
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:06,680
back and reprise her role tentatively 2006 for Resident Evil 3 I haven't seen

404
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,920
the second one but I heard that it kind of went really crazy I heard it wasn't

405
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:15,280
so hot but I don't really know I don't follow the games enough or I don't I

406
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,260
well yeah I don't follow the games enough for one I mean they're okay I

407
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:23,720
plan but I'm more into Silent Hill than the first one followed very I think

408
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:30,460
could have easily fit in with the whole established storyline for the game, but the second one

409
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:36,520
with bringing in, with changing up Jill and all that I think completely ruined their chances.

410
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,760
It made the movie seem less a part of the franchise.

411
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,760
Hmm.

412
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,760
Yes.

413
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,760
What?

414
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,760
Continue.

415
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,820
You want me to get to this story?

416
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,760
I was gonna talk about this earlier.

417
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,760
Alright.

418
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,120
Dead or Alive is the next movie I wanted to mention.

419
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,780
Dead or Alive is coming to the big screen.

420
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:58,000
Dead or Alive is being budgeted at $30 million.

421
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,760
It's being directed by Hong Kong action film director

422
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,120
Corey Yuan, who did Romeo Must Die,

423
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,320
which I thought was a very cool movie.

424
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,300
That was a good movie.

425
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,040
Producing the movie Jeremy Bolt,

426
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,920
who of course is also tied to the Resident Evil films.

427
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,760
The movie's script being written by J.F. Lawton,

428
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,760
who did Pretty Woman, of all things,

429
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,240
and Seth Gross, who did Devour,

430
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,880
which is an upcoming movie.

431
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,880
What we should mention.

432
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,040
I do wanna mention this.

433
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:27,780
Kasumi being played by Devon Aoki who was Miho in Sin City and also for those who may

434
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:36,820
not have seen Sin City she was also I believe Kiki which was the hot Asian driver that was

435
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,820
in Too Fast Too Furious.

436
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:43,760
So who's got Hayabusa?

437
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:49,780
They haven't talked about, actually it's Kane Kosugi who is in Godzilla Final Wars will

438
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,260
will be Ryu Hayabusa.

439
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,100
Ryu.

440
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,340
Ryu, sorry, ooh, Ryu.

441
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,820
That's my bad pronunciation coming in again.

442
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,900
Actually, okay, well we've got,

443
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:01,900
I was looking earlier at the people playing the different.

444
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,060
Let me name some more here,

445
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,040
because I have a bunch here.

446
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,620
Jamie Presley from Not Another Teen Movie is Tina.

447
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:12,400
Nastasia Malth from Elektra is Ayan.

448
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,020
Sarah Carter from Final Destination 2 is Helena.

449
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:20,460
And Australian pop star Holly Valance is Christy.

450
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:24,060
She was also in National Lampoon's Pledge This.

451
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:27,180
Professional wrestler Kevin Nash is Bass.

452
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,500
Oh my god.

453
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,140
Well, the thing is, though, is that in the game, though,

454
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,180
he looks like Hulk Hogan.

455
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,540
But that kind of makes sense.

456
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,460
And Brian J. White, who by the way

457
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:40,420
is also coming up in a film adaptation of Tekken,

458
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,700
is going to be Zach.

459
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,500
I didn't even know they were doing a film adaptation

460
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,460
of Tekken.

461
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:48,380
They better have somebody hot playing Jean.

462
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:54,100
Now I gotta look at the Tekken news.

463
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,420
Oh man, all I gotta say is they got one hot Kasp on there.

464
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:01,420
I need to see this. That's really uh... Kevin Nash is in it.

465
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:07,660
Dan's gonna flip. Brian J. White playing Bruce, that's all they've got so far.

466
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:11,040
Interesting. Kevin Nash, wow. He was

467
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:16,240
diesel back in the w c w d uh... tech it is being directed by charles stone the

468
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,120
third

469
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,640
uh... right written by michael colary and mike wet

470
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,880
were whoever the

471
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,980
all those people are i'm on video game movie overload but i saved the best for

472
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,560
last boys and girls

473
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:32,960
well let me give you an idea of who are mike where is he would be writing on

474
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,520
laura croft to greater

475
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,880
and face off

476
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,520
and the original that movie

477
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,760
and um... also uh... michael uh...

478
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,040
correa where

479
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:47,440
did also writing on the uh... laura croft you're here and as face-off as

480
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,000
well so that's kinda neat

481
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,340
uh... director charles and the third

482
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:56,480
uh... did mister three thousand uh... drumline in painful so

483
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,620
uh... just a few never heard of the area anyway i'd say the best for last

484
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,440
months

485
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,880
is the best

486
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,000
uh... they're making a movie out of the game postal

487
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,700
postal you remember the very controversial game

488
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,760
where uh... let's see what's the tagline

489
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,620
it's uh... i i i don't know i don't know you basically was just kill people in

490
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,000
all the great ways you can

491
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,640
the director who's attached to the postal movie

492
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,120
you evil

493
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,960
i'd just thought that

494
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,200
most

495
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,800
maybe you know what i do they keep giving that man work he's like all he's

496
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,500
doing it

497
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:35,600
i'm this match up all the movie possible rights possible and make

498
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:41,000
crap and keep cheering it out over and over. Honestly, people, have they watched these

499
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,220
movies that have been made? Save your dignity. Yeah, but keep in mind half of Hollywood's

500
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:51,600
on drugs and the other half is being a lawmaker. This movie game, Uwe Boll by the way for those

501
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:58,600
who may not know, famous for his work on the films Alone in the Dark, House of the Dead,

502
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,600
of the dead and the upcoming blood rain.

503
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:07,400
Which by the way is pretty cool and has nothing to do with the damn game at all.

504
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,440
In fact the chick in it does not even have the same hair color.

505
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,940
It has nothing to do with the movie.

506
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:18,080
Much like Alone in the dark had nothing to do with the movie and oh guess what?

507
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,920
House of the dead had nothing to do with the movie.

508
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,360
They were all prequels because guess what you can do whatever the fuck you want and

509
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,980
you know how the movie is going to end.

510
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:30,940
Dewey Bowl will get to work on this film, the film adaptation of Postal, but he has

511
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:36,020
one other game he's got to work on first, and that is the film adaptation of Microsoft's

512
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,220
Dungeon Siege, the PC game.

513
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:42,700
He's also doing Far Cry.

514
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:46,700
It's the career video game movie maker, boys and girls.

515
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:50,880
Honestly, you know what, I remember back in the day when I thought Mortal Kombat the movie

516
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,740
kind of sucked, or Mortal Kombat Annihilation.

517
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,620
It's starting to look pretty good right now, isn't it?

518
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:59,860
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Mortal Kombat Annihilation is an hour and a half of my life that I really

519
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:00,860
want back.

520
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,060
Suddenly that Final Fantasy movie wasn't so bad, was it?

521
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,740
Oh, the Final Fantasy movie was good.

522
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,740
Yeah, but it wasn't Final Fantasy.

523
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,740
It wasn't Final Fantasy.

524
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,740
But as a movie, it was good.

525
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,380
It should have been Alien 5.

526
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:16,940
Here's what it's got to come up with though, I mean Rob, it's like this, basically you've

527
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:23,980
got a movie coming out this fall, Doom, starring The Rock or whatever.

528
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:26,060
This has the potential to be pretty good.

529
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,780
I mean, that and the Halo movie.

530
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,340
What we need is good video game movies to come out.

531
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:33,740
Honestly, I am so not interested in a Halo movie.

532
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,740
Love the game.

533
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:37,060
I just, I know that a movie will ruin it.

534
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,740
So I'm not interested in the movie.

535
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,740
Okay, okay, well fine, fine.

536
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,740
Maybe not that, but like Spy Hunter.

537
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,980
Okay, these movies, they'll be okay.

538
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,740
They'll be, they could be good, okay?

539
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,740
Could be.

540
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,740
Could be good.

541
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,740
Could be.

542
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,740
That's a big if.

543
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,860
Okay, assuming Doom is good, okay?

544
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:58,180
the doom movie is good hopefully people say okay this is what they could be and not let

545
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:03,500
ui bowl direct anything ever again in fact ui bowls should be i want to put a hit out

546
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:08,660
on ui bowl no stop this is downloadable by anybody on the internet don't go there they

547
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:13,820
need to do a movie version of hell and have dennis hopper in it yeah of course you know

548
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:19,820
land of the dead's coming out and he's in it ui bowl is like the video game version

549
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,920
of M. Night Shyamalan. He was just like,

550
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,220
Hey, don't insult...

551
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,480
M. Night Shyamalan. Don't insult him.

552
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,220
Yeah.

553
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,420
So what if the ending of Signs was crap?

554
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,320
I haven't seen Signs.

555
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,320
The Village was pretty good.

556
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,820
Signs was not crap. The Village was retarded.

557
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,820
I like The Village, you should.

558
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,320
The Village was an intelligent movie.

559
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,620
I like The Village, you should.

560
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,020
It required thought.

561
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:43,020
Oh, wow. I couldn't figure out what the plot twist was gonna be

562
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,020
about five minutes into the movie.

563
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,820
Suddenly, Orange Lounge Radio has turned into the movie poop shoot.

564
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,220
I see. So I think it's time...

565
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,620
Movie poop shoot to go.

566
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:55,980
