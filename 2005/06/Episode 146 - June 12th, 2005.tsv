490534	495436	We're plugged in and fully interactive through our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com.
496616	498578	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
498678	504923	Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers, DarkSakura.
507405	508566	Someone keyed my new car.
509787	510207	What?
511108	514871	Yeah, I don't know if it's already there, but it's very hard to tell because my car is silver.
515351	515491	Uh-huh.
515692	518194	So it doesn't show up as glaringly as it would on any other color.
518814	519154	Oh my gosh.
519174	522958	But I noticed it, I was like, the light is reflecting in a funny way.
522978	523298	Uh-huh.
524150	534361	I got your car, and my car kicks everybody's ass twice, and several times on Sunday, and then, like, just fucks all that shit up.
535883	537745	Well, I'm sure we'll be hearing more about that later.
537825	540628	Also joining us tonight, say hello to TechMassaLoki.
540648	541890	Hi.
543391	544712	I finished my pizza.
544932	546293	You finished your pizza and breadsticks tonight.
546613	549094	Sorry about the little hiccup there in the beginning, boys and girls.
549655	555718	We accidentally had a router mishap, and so something came unplugged during the intro there.
555738	556638	We cut the wrong wire.
558119	566304	Yes, basically, we accidentally cut the wire that would blow everything up, because you know how in the movies... It's like you press the red button in Maniac Mansion in the pool.
568812	573255	Or for those that didn't play through that game, which would be a lot of our audience, because that game is kind of old.
573455	580599	I'd always get just fed up and purposefully find the pool, drain it, because the pool cooled the nuclear reactor, and pressing the button made it explode.
580619	585142	I wish they would release that TV show on DVD or something, because I totally miss the TV show.
585402	586703	Okay, anyway, my analogy.
586983	592767	You know how in the movies they always have the green wire and the red wire, and you have to cut the right wire or everything will blow up?
593227	596609	Well, we accidentally cut the wire that blew everything up, so...
597625	625704	Yeah, anyway Moving on We are back, hello We got a fun show for you guys tonight We even have a very special guest here tonight But he'll introduce himself after the first break Because we don't have all our listeners back yet We had a mishap Yeah, so we'll be back So let's go to a break and when we come back we'll get to the show As I mentioned in the opening there We are going to debut an Ultramix 3 song A brand new song here on the show
626425	627166	Yeah, that's cool.
627506	631691	And the thing is, is that it's already been out there on the internet, just nobody found it yet.
631831	632292	But we did.
632712	635435	So we're going to unveil it for the rest of you guys.
635475	641001	We're going to point at the pink elephant in the room tonight and say, look, Ultramix 3 song, right over there.
641201	643804	There'll be also some more crapper debuting, too.
644245	644645	Like what?
645206	645406	Well...
646061	647922	What's it say on the CD here?
648082	651363	There's two songs on there, and what are they... Interesting.
651863	653303	Am I supposed to say now or later?
653423	663647	We'll say it later, but there's two songs on there that have remixes to them now, and they're okay, but they'll never be released on the internet because they're B-sides.
663847	665747	Alright, so tonight's the only time you'll hear them then?
665967	666448	Well, maybe.
666708	666988	Alright.
667907	669007	Let's go into this break.
669047	672308	In this first break, we're going to hear some music from DDR Ultramix 2.
672948	678729	Starting off with a song we were the first to blow the lid off of last year, about a year ago this time, so here it is.
679429	685371	For those of you guys that are trying to get your friends in to listen, because we are going to be announcing that new song and playing the new song, we have it.
685691	688071	We found a copy of it out there, so we're going to play the new song for you guys.
688451	690132	That should be about 7.45, 8 o'clock-ish.
692532	693052	Just so you know.
693113	695595	But don't just tune out and then tune back in then.
695615	698437	Because we've got loads of fun for you guys tonight.
698517	701739	Cage match and stuff going on within the groove as well.
702280	705002	And all the stuff you know and love here at Orange Lounge Radio.
705022	706043	We'll be back after this.
720954	747898	Tone poem dreams, alpha perfection, so very hard to reach Harmony machine, tormenting the sensory Deliciously evolved, and yet nobody knows Tittle tattle, chicken chat, shoots in the breeze Platter, clack, hate and splatter, there's a vagraness in me
764444	766685	Thank you for watching!
832235	833372	Thank you for watching!
862759	866027	Let me tell you something you don't know
956005	972134	I was picked up for a TV show It's called A24 I am the girl that you all know To love, hate or adore I've been waiting all my life Just to be seen Seen by everyone I wanted to be someone
1148362	1156929	Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter D, the letter A, and the number 59.
1156969	1162933	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
1164234	1172701	And we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 146, off to a very interesting start tonight.
1173635	1177797	with some stuff going on there in the opening where we kind of disconnected there for a little bit.
1178177	1181538	And now folks in the chatroom are saying they heard skips there in the last break.
1181758	1182859	I have no idea what that's about.
1182939	1186700	We don't show anything going on on our end, but I have no idea.
1187580	1188861	So hopefully everything's okay.
1190842	1194623	Anyway, tonight we are going to play a brand new song from Ultramix 3 for you guys.
1195623	1200425	Probably in about... I don't know, probably about a little over an hour from now.
1201626	1202246	In the meantime...
1202881	1205423	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1225794	1227537	So back at the old Konami now?
1227737	1228519	Yeah.
1229100	1229680	How's it going?
1230101	1230682	Pretty good.
1232665	1234468	Yeah, that's all I can say about that.
1235029	1235510	Yeah, I know.
1235610	1237874	You can't really say anything, can you?
1238114	1239156	No, I can't.
1239456	1239997	That's a bummer.
1240714	1244515	Have you gotten to at least see the new stuff that we're all excited about?
1244795	1245355	I don't know.
1245455	1247016	It's a little thing called NDA.
1247356	1248556	Ah, you can't even say that.
1248576	1249776	I don't think I can say that.
1250457	1252077	Alright, well, that's too bad.
1252417	1254057	Which means that's a... What?
1254658	1255958	That means yes, he has.
1256598	1258078	That's exactly what that means.
1258138	1258739	Is that no meaning yes?
1258759	1263060	Because it would have been a no, otherwise, not, I can't talk about that.
1263140	1267461	Hey, let's use some reverse psychology to figure out some more stuff here.
1268001	1270122	So every time I answer NDA, that means yes?
1275985	1279306	Was somebody smoking crack when they put Butterfly on Ultramix 3?
1280727	1281267	NDA.
1282328	1283328	Okay, just curious.
1284669	1290912	Alright, also I have to point out is that because we are disclosing a new song tonight,
1291252	1295436	This has nothing to do with the coincidence that Miklatov is here because he is under an NDA.
1295576	1299759	Yeah, I didn't know about this until yesterday that you even knew about the song.
1299819	1300740	Yes.
1300960	1308866	As you will find out when we reveal the song, you'll find out why we're revealing the song and it will make sense how all the cards kind of fell into place.
1308927	1310748	So we'll kind of get to that when we talk about the song.
1311288	1312069	GamePro again!
1313490	1317013	It actually was not GamePro, funny enough, but it was an internet website that spilled it.
1317153	1317914	I will say that much.
1319658	1324600	And it wasn't a DDR-related website, so it's just... It's a website.
1324660	1325221	It's a website.
1325241	1326841	Yes, so we'll get to that a little later.
1328662	1333304	So we're going to get to that, but first we've got to start off the show with a little bit of how was your week, how was your day?
1333564	1337206	And DarkSakura, I know you're dying to tell us all about the new vehicle.
1337226	1338567	So how was your week, how was your day?
1338707	1340688	The rest of my week I could give a rat's ass about.
1342168	1347251	We went on Friday to one of the Mitsubishi dealerships in town because I had settled on getting a Lancer.
1348471	1372996	and they gave us a good deal on a not too exciting 2004, you know, it only had like 5,000 miles on it, so it was really good, it had all the options, everything else, like, okay, this is nice, and then we went to Fairfield, and they had a 2002 Lancer OZ Rally Edition, which is what I wanted, and the thing about it is that this
1374995	1398776	has, is basically, when I think Lancer, this is the car I think of, it has the logo and wide letters across the back instead of just eensy tiny at the bottom of the trunk, and has the, the, you know, the custom rims for the, for that model, has all the bells and whistles, it's automatic on top of it, we did look at an evolution, and there's no way I could ever fucking afford that car.
1399977	1406600	Hey, I also got a warranty on it that's basically the warranty for a brand new car on a 2002 model.
1406660	1409901	So basically, I have an old car with a brand new warranty on it.
1410742	1411962	And it's fabulous.
1412022	1412562	It's silver.
1412662	1416284	It only has a little ding on the fender, and then I found the scratch on the door.
1417284	1418105	But it's fast.
1419165	1423667	It goes from zero to 60 in less than three seconds.
1423707	1425388	How fast have you taken it so far?
1426308	1427108	Ben took it to 95.
1430225	1432867	He got challenged on Roosevelt Road driving my car last night.
1433107	1433648	To a race?
1433908	1434568	Yes, to a race.
1435049	1438351	He passed some Civic, and he just swooped right down in front of him.
1438811	1441733	And so the guy in the Civic started flashing his lights like he wanted to race.
1442554	1443874	And then pulled up in the lane beside him.
1445456	1448558	Dan said he might have done it, but I would have had his balls for breakfast.
1449499	1451040	Or at least would have fed it to him for breakfast.
1451741	1453022	So, good boy.
1453162	1455104	Tie the car around a tree the first day out.
1455144	1455925	That's a great idea.
1455985	1461409	Yeah, especially since from that area, Roosevelt Road goes to one lane.
1462150	1463471	Yeah, not smart.
1466254	1467315	My week has been car.
1468075	1468936	Oh yeah, and I got an iPod.
1469456	1469837	It was free.
1471009	1472911	So the free iPod site actually worked?
1473231	1473511	Yes.
1473591	1476553	Is there an engraving on the thing that says freeipods.com or whatever?
1476693	1477854	No, it's just an iPod.
1478154	1478554	Nice.
1478754	1479255	How many gigs?
1480055	1479255	20.
1480555	1480896	All right.
1481116	1482136	And in FM tuner now.
1482356	1483497	How much have you filled it up already?
1484037	1484238	About 10.
1485649	1493120	And I have a 28 gigabyte collection, so I was taking off all the stuff that I never listen to but play for other people.
1494062	1494362	Right on.
1494502	1497166	Like, none of my Bimani music is in it except for all my Taku stuff.
1497207	1497827	You know what's interesting?
1497888	1499550	None of my Bimani music is in my iPod either.
1499570	1501253	I have some of the long versions.
1502074	1502654	Yeah, me too.
1502714	1504315	I have, like, some long versions.
1504375	1507656	Like, I have Conga Feelin' in there, because you have to have Conga Feelin', obviously.
1508876	1509516	And very few others.
1509556	1514237	I have a couple Loki remixes, funny enough, which are, you know, somewhat Bomani-related, I suppose.
1514477	1518998	Celica only goes to 101.
1519239	1521959	He only took the car that fast just because of the road.
1522459	1523540	My car will top out at 100.
1525000	1527541	Well, the guy at the dealership said he got it going at 130.
1529577	1530317	and still had room.
1531598	1533859	I'm just making a promise in the chat room.
1533899	1534560	Interesting comment.
1534580	1537822	Speaking of our chat room, why don't you join at www.orangelandredo.com.
1537862	1538482	Click on chat.
1538502	1539943	We've got a lot of interesting folks in there.
1540943	1544465	Sephiroth1215 says, I'm thinking about doing the free Xbox 360.
1544525	1546346	What do you think about that?
1546426	1553210	Now that you have reaped the rewards of one of these free iPod.com sites, what do you think of other free stuff?
1553250	1556052	First of all, the Xbox 360 isn't going to be out for months.
1557700	1562764	That's why I think it's weird that there's already all these banner ads for win a free PlayStation 3.
1563404	1566567	The thing is, look at what type of offers they have.
1566667	1571632	I did the Blockbuster one because you have to sign up for an offer and you have to get five more people to do it.
1572172	1573613	I signed up for the Blockbuster one.
1574594	1576756	It had a two week trial on it.
1577016	1578558	It takes them five days.
1579537	1584840	To confirm, they do not bill you until your free trial is up, and you can cancel within your free trial.
1585801	1588102	So I waited until it confirmed, and I canceled it.
1589063	1589763	No money lost.
1590704	1592505	That's what a lot of people do.
1592645	1595086	So people wonder how do they make money off this.
1595186	1601110	Keep in mind as well that you're putting a lot of your shipping, your address, all that stuff on those sites that you're doing the offers for.
1601710	1603031	They will sell your information.
1603496	1604657	Yep, absolutely.
1604857	1607238	Because I actually got, and they'll spam your email box.
1607818	1612121	So you have to, you know, basically get their physical address and send them an affidavit.
1612221	1614422	Do not sell my information.
1614582	1615543	Opt out of any sharing.
1615563	1617184	Because under privacy law, they have to do it.
1617624	1617824	Right.
1618484	1622547	But, or just move on them, which is something you're going to be doing soon anyway, right?
1622567	1623207	Boarding addresses.
1624348	1625028	Oh, I guess that's true.
1625822	1626822	Oh, the junk mail finds you.
1627683	1634225	Is there a way that when you put out your forwarding address, except for iPodFreeStuff.com or whatever site you use?
1634865	1634985	No.
1635125	1635625	That's too bad.
1636346	1641247	Although what I do want to do is take the junk mail one day and just put a big return to sender stamp on it.
1643608	1644288	Does it really work?
1645189	1645929	I haven't tried it yet.
1646669	1651971	Or, one thing, there's free offer things, you know, sign up for this credit card.
1652731	1656212	I used to chop up their offer and put it in the envelope and mail it back to them.
1658873	1659493	That's great.
1660414	1661234	Do they still send them to you?
1661816	1664298	I used to write deceased on mine.
1666119	1666760	You used to write what?
1667040	1668661	Deceased.
1670403	1671704	I stopped getting those offers.
1672524	1676567	I used to send them fingers, but then they started showing up in chili bowls, so I had to stop doing that.
1679329	1680230	I'm not paid to be funny.
1680951	1682112	Anything else you want to share about your week?
1682712	1683773	You're not paid at all.
1684383	1685704	We do this out of love and ego
1712156	1716839	Now, aren't you worried about the Miklatov fan club like assaulting you at SVGL now that you've said that?
1717540	1719801	No, because I don't have a fan club.
1720442	1721863	I have haters.
1722523	1723264	You have haters?
1723324	1723704	Yeah.
1723764	1724585	Why do you have haters?
1724605	1725225	Because I'm a jerk.
1725605	1726446	You're a jerk.
1726706	1728307	You are, but I mean, you know.
1729648	1733531	People still bring up the whole last year with the extreme thread how...
1734065	1735746	We gave them not real clues.
1736766	1737367	But that was funny.
1739147	1742589	Which would be even funnier if you guys don't give them any clues this year.
1742649	1743970	That would be hilarious.
1743990	1745891	That would be hilarious.
1746471	1746851	Let's see.
1746891	1748112	Okay, I just said that.
1748132	1748692	That was my week.
1748912	1751353	And then yesterday I got really drunk.
1751973	1753274	And I was on the floor a lot.
1753334	1753994	Were you dunked?
1754615	1755735	I was so dunked.
1756155	1758176	At one point I think I asked if I was black.
1760983	1763859	For the record, boys and girls, Mikhail Tav is not black.
1764936	1771298	Um, yeah, and I was on the floor a whole lot, and played drinking games, and it was fun.
1771918	1774999	Except for the pain of my stomach with the alcohol.
1775260	1778741	But, um, yeah, I haven't done much.
1780081	1782542	I kinda, oh, I picked up a Blue DS!
1782882	1784223	That's hot, because it's blue.
1785163	1787824	And now I have to get Nintendogs for it, because Nintendogs is fun.
1787844	1788784	Because of the puppies!
1788884	1789284	Exactly.
1789304	1791025	You have to tell the ball story, though.
1792076	1794738	because I got so much exercise in the mall today because of you.
1794838	1795079	Oh, okay.
1795279	1800063	So EB has this promotion going on where you buy a DS and get Mario free.
1800424	1804307	So we went to EB in the mall, which was on the other side of the mall from where we parked.
1805028	1807430	Get there, I'm like, hey, I want a blue DS with free Mario.
1807450	1808391	They didn't have Mario.
1809852	1811774	I was kind of sad, and I was like, okay, I'll just buy it.
1812274	1816218	So I take an ad just because I wanted to look at it, and I bought the DS.
1816818	1819060	And I'm like, maybe GameStop will match the ad.
1819120	1820441	And that's on the other side of the mall.
1820521	1822002	So we go to the other side of the mall.
1822382	1824023	I still have my blue DS from EB.
1824143	1824724	Go in there.
1825364	1827986	I ask if they will match the ad.
1828006	1830408	And he's like, yeah, if you have the ad with you, which I did.
1831429	1835512	But I had this blue DS that I had to go take back to EB first to get the money back for.
1836312	1843358	So we walked to the other side of the mall again to EB, talked to the guy, tell him that I want my free games, so I'm going to go to GameStop.
1843378	1844159	He was cool about it.
1844499	1850144	And we walked to the other side of the mall, to GameStop, to get my Blue DS and my free Mario.
1850224	1856089	And then I wanted a USB cable as well, but they were all $15, and they came with software I didn't need.
1856349	1860753	And I have one back in Kansas that's like a $5 one, but it's back in Kansas.
1862294	1863535	I could have given you one for free.
1864809	1865712	I got one for free now.
1867538	1869384	That was it.
1871690	1873692	All right, yeah, I got a lot of exercise in the mall today, thanks.
1873792	1876254	Oh, and there are these little skanks that were performing.
1876474	1878156	They were seven years old.
1878276	1881839	They looked like they were performing to become future strippers, is what it was.
1882479	1883140	And it was great.
1884161	1886002	There was a lot of pedophiles there, you could tell.
1886723	1894089	What was great is at the mall here, they have one of those local news stations that does their live broadcast from the mall or whatever.
1894169	1899894	So right next to that is one of those stores where little girls can go and buy accessories.
1900216	1902200	Like, it's not Claire's, but it's some other store.
1902240	1903663	They learn how to make jewelry and stuff.
1904404	1908933	Yeah, like, stupid spoiled whore or something is the store.
1908953	1909253	I don't know.
1909892	1913675	All those old guys were just standing there watching and it was great.
1937305	1939206	Let's see here.
1939226	1939206	777.
1939246	1940107	Hey, that's 21!
1940627	1940967	Legal!
1942228	1943529	Let's see.
1943549	1943529	777.
1943569	1944389	Jackpot!
1944449	1944869	All right.
1946650	1950853	I do remember Christopher, my roommate, making a comment as we were walking by, though.
1950873	1952974	He said something about, like, very loudly.
1953014	1960518	He said something like, dirty whores, and one of the old guys, like, clicked his tongue at him as if he was, like, tisking at him.
1961419	1961779	It's funny.
1964804	1966405	That's what most people do when they listen to this show.
1967726	1967966	Alright.
1968427	1968667	Anyway.
1969007	1970248	Loki, how was your week?
1970268	1970648	How was your day?
1972109	1972930	My week was okay.
1972950	1974131	I didn't do too much.
1975712	1976973	Well, let's see.
1977213	1978554	I went out and got a new game.
1978934	1981436	Because I have like $90 in credit to GameStop.
1981476	1984458	So I was like... Some of the games stopped because we were bored.
1984939	1986340	So we went around the mall.
1986660	1988621	And I was like, I want Tetris World!
1988761	1990122	So I gave her Tetris World.
1990583	1991403	And I bought myself...
1992799	1993720	I don't know why that's funny.
1993760	1994201	Girls are funny.
2009321	2030637	and then and then and then what was it we were wandering around looking for other stuff and I'm like hey look there's like one of those shower massagers and I'm like do you want me to get you one of those too and I forget what she said it wasn't like um she's like oh that's that's right um she's all what what would I use that for I'm like masturbation I said that really loud
2033132	2034433	And so that was quite funny.
2034753	2038535	But then also, let's see, what else did I do this week?
2041897	2043338	Watched a lot of X-Play.
2044058	2045799	A lot, a lot of X-Play.
2046079	2048961	And now I love the little kitties that are on there, the censor kitties.
2049622	2060973	And, um, oh yeah, I also mentioned that I tried, um, pirating Seven Sins, and, um, it didn't work because of the CD, uh, copy protection and stuff, but I'm gonna get the work eventually.
2061093	2065057	Right now I'm, uh, working on Grand Theft Auto San Andreas for the PC, because that'll be fun.
2065818	2070283	I do have a legal copy, though, for my PlayStation 2, I just wanna play it on the PC now, too.
2071530	2073151	So I say that's completely illegal.
2074111	2083255	And other than that, I've been... I tried playing some Final Fantasy, and the servers got DNS'd attacked again.
2083535	2083975	Again?
2083995	2085076	They haven't fixed that crap yet?
2085156	2085596	Again.
2086056	2088117	Thank God I quit.
2088477	2090838	But it's cool, though, because it was right about when I was going to go to bed.
2091399	2092919	I was trying to figure a way to get out of the party.
2092959	2093800	I'm like, oh, that'll work.
2096141	2097641	So, yeah, that was it.
2098642	2098922	All right.
2099617	2101298	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2122003	2125184	I started drinking at about 6 o'clock last night, and what was I having?
2125505	2132208	Oh, I had that Malibu and Pineapple, but it was about the equivalent of about 10 shots of Malibu, and then a little bit of Pineapple in there.
2132628	2137230	So I started drinking that, and I think I had downed that whole thing by 7 o'clock.
2137630	2138830	So by that point, I was pretty butted.
2138850	2140391	And then I had a couple other miscellaneous shots.
2140411	2141512	I was pretty much drunk by 7.30.
2143012	2149295	Well, finally, I think I sobered up, and I was ready to go to the club about 9 o'clock.
2149775	2150836	No, stop laughing!
2152850	2156431	By the time I actually got to the bar, I was pretty sober.
2157371	2161992	Not like 100% sober, like I wouldn't try to drive a car or anything, but I was coherent, right?
2162352	2163892	So I get to the club, and what do I do?
2164032	2166413	I start drinking again, because I want to get drunk again.
2166773	2171794	But then everybody kept leaving, and I was dancing, and I didn't really end up getting drunk, just kind of buzzed.
2172234	2177295	Which is too bad, because that would have been quite an accomplishment to get drunk, sober, and then drunk again all in one night.
2177755	2180396	So I will just have to aspire to do that in a future week.
2182176	2182656	I've done it.
2183252	2185593	I bet you have.
2185673	2186114	I've done it.
2186154	2187694	Didn't you do that here on a show once?
2188395	2189035	Yes, I did.
2190276	2190796	Yes, I did.
2190896	2192917	We have to do another drunk show sometime.
2192957	2194758	We kind of missed the last couple three-day weekends.
2194778	2196138	Getting me drunk's expensive.
2198099	2199420	Let's find some cheap tequila.
2199520	2202782	What day does the 4th of July fall on?
2203002	2205023	I'm probably doing, well, I don't know.
2205043	2206764	I actually have had a hangover.
2206864	2209425	Didn't you swear after the last drunk show that you weren't doing it again?
2210785	2212026	Yeah.
2212286	2212846	Hey.
2213387	2213607	Hey.
2213687	2214267	Guess what?
2214328	2214528	What?
2214968	2217169	The 4th of July falls on a Monday.
2217650	2218010	Oh, right.
2218050	2219171	I work for a bank.
2219711	2220652	All right.
2220732	2222053	Sounds like we have a date set.
2222573	2223674	We're having a drunk show.
2223894	2225275	You, me, and a bottle of tequila.
2225315	2225936	I'll have a date.
2226776	2227417	Hey, I got it.
2227497	2227657	No.
2228297	2230739	I will do a drunk show on one condition.
2231820	2234982	The tequila is the good agave tequila.
2235002	2235082	Okay.
2235273	2237194	How much is that going to set us back a bottle?
2237794	2241095	Get the crappy shit and then get a Brita water filter.
2243055	2245716	You filter it through a few times, golden.
2247196	2254298	Some of our younger listeners are kind of lost in this conversation right now, and I say that's good because... You're too young to be drinking, children.
2254658	2257219	Yes, you should not be drinking until you're of age.
2257259	2259159	Exactly, you've got to get the order of ages right.
2259239	2261660	First it's illegitimate children, then it's drinking.
2264580	2265781	I could take Vicodin right now.
2284864	2286105	Don't take Vicodin and then drink.
2286145	2287105	That's really, really bad.
2287765	2288866	I don't think I can do it right now.
2289186	2294648	I'll have to do an all-nighter if it's going to be a drinking show because I can't drive home afterwards.
2294688	2295849	We should do an all-nighter show.
2296889	2297589	Oh, God.
2300331	2302591	Oh, my God, that would be great.
2302972	2304672	Just, like, run out of things to talk about.
2304812	2305513	Let's get Miklatov.
2305533	2307213	I'm so drunk.
2307454	2311515	Let's get Miklatov here and get him drunk, too, and then we'll probably be able to get around that NDA.
2313717	2316760	So, Black Mikulatov, what do you have for us now?
2320884	2323046	Maybe we could get him to bring some of his co-workers up here.
2323066	2323806	We'll get them all drunk.
2323886	2325027	One of them is liable to spill the beans.
2326128	2327189	Get Jason Enos up here.
2328551	2329071	There you go.
2331874	2332594	That's what we need to do.
2332674	2333635	Tell Jason Enos to come up.
2333655	2334196	We'll get him drunk.
2334997	2335958	He should come on the show.
2336098	2338460	We'll promise him liquor if you come hang out with us.
2343026	2343667	Ah, fun times.
2343807	2344107	All right.
2344608	2346789	Enough talk about things that will be happening in the future.
2346849	2355816	Let's talk about things that are happening in the now, such as an upcoming break and an Ultramix 3 song coming your way in about 45 minutes.
2355836	2356396	Eventually.
2356997	2357197	Yes.
2357777	2361060	And here's like a little bit of a hint as to tonight's song.
2362870	2375357	When we discovered what the song was, I could do nothing but laugh because it really fits in with a theme we've been having going on on this show for the past couple weeks.
2375837	2378719	Like, it's so funny.
2378839	2382081	I can't even, yeah, this is going to be so funny.
2382201	2382721	I can't wait.
2383641	2384142	I can't wait.
2384362	2386443	It's like the biggest coincidence ever.
2387443	2387884	It's amazing.
2388627	2390589	I'm a little, little, little mermaid
2414312	2416974	Nobody wants to know, and our beautiful world

2830479	2833720	Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.
2834301	2836061	Orange Lounge Radio.
2837982	2840263	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
2841084	2843985	Episode number 146.
2844085	2845586	You want to have a contest to name your car?
2845606	2847246	I want to have a contest to name my car.
2847266	2848647	I thought you were going to name your car God.
2849767	2855390	No, because then I'd start calling it, you know, like, every self a deity or Jesus or...
2856914	2859935	And when I say, oh my god, I'm usually not referring to your car.
2860135	2861435	But I have a friend who goes, oh my car.
2863715	2864976	Seriously, she goes, oh my car.
2865876	2866176	Wow.
2866816	2867456	That's pretty awesome.
2869877	2873798	The bitch tickler is being suggested in the chat room.
2874018	2874658	That's okay.
2874758	2877798	Wow, that sounds like a hardcore band.
2878819	2880279	Like an industrial band.
2881073	2883355	Live, it's Bitch Tickler!
2884115	2897105	If someone can suggest a name for my car that fits in with my interests and my pretty, pretty car with those stupid key skirts on it, then you will get something nice from me after I move.
2897465	2898546	Maybe like a piece of the car?
2898947	2899227	No!
2899247	2900908	Fuck no!
2902329	2902930	My!
2903010	2903930	How about a dust ball?
2904371	2905852	It's called my car.
2907053	2908614	And nobody gets a part of it but me.
2911709	2914270	My car.
2918492	2919252	My car!
2920453	2921053	Mine!
2921073	2922394	I waited a month!
2922734	2923154	Mine!
2924455	2929818	We're still going to be doing the Ultra Mix 3 song in about 30 minutes.
2930158	2932219	But for now, let's talk about another dancing game series.
2932439	2933319	Into Groove.
2933479	2936121	Into Groove was released, I guess, this week.
2937578	2939300	I don't get the whole in the groove thing.
2939320	2939981	You know what's funny?
2940041	2958238	And we went into both those game stores today and in both of them I completely neglected to check to see if the groove was in stock because I just... We went into GameStop three times and went into EB twice and none of those times did I bother to check for in the groove because that just wasn't the thing that was on my mind today.
2958298	2958739	I feel bad.
2960527	2966488	No, but the honest, you know, I would probably pick up In The Groove because, you know, I'm a dance game whore.
2967408	2970949	But I don't have a PS2 American, and I have yet to mod my Japanese one.
2971449	2974670	And I don't know if I want to mod my Japanese one because I'm afraid of fucking it up.
2974870	2975470	You'll fuck it up.
2975530	2975790	Don't do it.
2975810	2976190	Exactly.
2976270	2978951	So I think I'll just wait for the slim PS2.
2979371	2982171	Well, actually, I don't want a slim PS2 because I want one that can put a hard drive in it.
2983272	2984512	So I have to wait for those PS2s to come.
2984552	2986992	I already have In The Groove with all the suns unlocked.
2987692	2988253	You already got it?
2988593	2989713	Yeah, it's called Step Mania.
2990646	2991407	I had it for years.
2991427	2993228	What the hell?
2994489	2995389	He made it funny.
2995789	2997691	I'm not going to buy it for the PlayStation 2.
2997851	2999352	I already have it on PC for free.
2999692	3001213	Well, this is the weird thing I don't get.
3001273	3007197	In the Groove was supposed to be released, what, June 17th, and then all of a sudden, surprise!
3007397	3015262	It's by June 17th because they realized... I don't think Red Octane has quite the shipping capability as, say, EA.
3015422	3016303	So they were just like...
3016883	3018124	They ship as much as we can.
3019605	3029995	That's understandable, but it's kind of interesting because that's not kind of what you're used to seeing for video game releases because usually it's like, okay, video games are going to ship this day to shelve the next day.
3030015	3031936	The traditional game release always works like that.
3032177	3035219	If Zelda's going to come out, you know it's going to ship and then shelve all that.
3035259	3042005	But then Red Octane's just kind of like, well, in the groove, it'll show up around June 17th.
3042145	3043727	Maybe you'll see it a little sooner, but
3044267	3045288	June 17th will be late.
3071826	3082058	So, because of the fact that I don't have a PS2 American, although I need to get one, because I want In the Groove, and I want Xtreme 2 for... And we love Katamari!
3082078	3087945	And we are Katamari, you know, and I gotta pick up the dance games that I was pretty much leeching from Loki when I lived there.
3088785	3089905	So I got to pick all those up again.
3090226	3091846	Although, I thought I owned one of those.
3092146	3092566	Maybe not.
3092926	3093667	Max 2, I think?
3093707	3095027	I did own Max 2 at one point.
3095107	3095887	I don't even know where it is.
3095967	3096507	Isn't that sad?
3097248	3101229	Anyway, so I got to get a PS2 at some point.
3101249	3111972	But in the meanwhile, those of you guys out there, you've already been picking up copies of In the Groove, and you've been posting to message boards about what songs are being unlocked and when.
3113753	3141828	And I believe, I'm trying to find out what the hidden In The Groove 2 songs were here Somebody had posted a complete list Somewhere in here, I'm looking through some threads over on ITGFreak.com Where they talk about In The Groove a lot Liquid Moon is one of the songs from In The Groove 2 That is in the game And I want to say Tribal Style is another one
3142964	3148968	Funk Factory, and Incognito?
3149449	3149869	Is that it?
3150009	3151710	Or is that in the group one?
3151830	3152711	I don't even know.
3157294	3164479	I'm sure somebody in the chat room will be sure to correct me, but I know folks over there were really excited about getting to play some songs from
3166684	3167665	in the groove too.
3167945	3168926	So that's kind of neat.
3168986	3172749	I do like how they did that is that they brought back some songs.
3174430	3180015	I'm sorry, brought songs that are going to be in the next mix, like preview tracks like these do, the old DDRs.
3180175	3182456	So how many songs have I got unlocked before the game is good?
3186179	3187020	You're ruthless.
3189482	3190863	I'm never going to buy that game.
3191644	3194686	Maybe if I get it for free or something, but I'll never...
3195276	3197917	I'll never, you know, pay my hard-earned money for that crap.
3198618	3201099	Instead, I'll buy, like, Dog's Life 2 or something.
3203501	3204301	You're really bad.
3207963	3209544	I'm trying to go to one of my other resources.
3209604	3210164	I know how this is on.
3210184	3210524	There we go.
3210544	3222011	Yes, it's Funk Factory by Money Deluxe, Incognito by Inspector K, Tribal Style by Ka, and Kid Whatever with Wake Up, which apparently is getting really good reviews already, so...
3226641	3227602	And I'm being corrected.
3227882	3229643	Liquid Moon is not a song from In The Groove 2.
3229983	3233586	It's just one of those ones that you could only play before in the non-stop mode.
3233826	3234467	How would I know that?
3234487	3235087	I don't play enough.
3235507	3235808	Sorry.
3236228	3237008	Sorry to disappoint.
3239450	3241372	Apparently you can unlock modifiers as well.
3242372	3243533	Bumpy, I think, was one of them.
3244294	3245935	Does it have a modifier to make it a good game?
3249713	3253055	I hear it has link mode with DDR, but they're not similar.
3253435	3253735	Don't worry.
3253755	3253995	No.
3254956	3256897	Or does it have pump-it-up mode?
3259518	3263060	Well, it does have hand plants, so I guess, yeah, sort of similar.
3263360	3268182	Does it have we are under the bed sheets with Endemiro mode?
3269703	3269803	No.
3272659	3292806	Some folks in chat room were talking about before the show that In The Groove 2 is out and about, apparently is starting to make its way out towards arcades, which kind of lines up with some chat that's been going on on the various web forums saying that In The Groove 2 is supposed to be shipping in this time frame early June, so In The Groove 2 could be coming to an arcade near you.
3293946	3298372	I haven't heard if it's new cabinets and the whole works or what.
3298472	3303438	I imagine the box door thing had to go away, but there's no clear answer to the box door.
3303478	3306942	Let me be the first to do a resounding, Yippee!
3307423	3309185	Oh my god, I can't wait!
3309946	3310987	The groove too!
3311007	3311828	It'll be so much fun!
3311848	3312429	No, sorry.
3312669	3312949	Sucks.
3313670	3316432	Well, look, I know you don't give a shit, and I know you don't give a shit.
3317012	3317672	I'll try it!
3318193	3323136	But there are people out there in the community that do care, so I'm just trying to report on their behalf.
3323396	3334062	Because from what I'm hearing, one of the folks in the chat room was talking to me about In the Groove 2 before the show, and was saying that it's very polished, like it's much more polished, and now we get characters...
3334782	3342225	You can buy boots at the thrift store and polish them up, but they're still boots from the thrift store.
3342265	3348287	Yes, there's hot new characters named Paige and Shemmy in the game.
3348447	3350087	We need Mr. Spanky!
3350108	3351548	I'm kidding, I completely made that up.
3351868	3352888	Don't send the hate mail, please.
3356630	3356930	Alright.
3357685	3369998	So, In The Groove 2 is out, and apparently it's really polished, and all the songs from In The Groove 1, and then some, including some DDR crossovers like Bambi, and just some crazy stuff.
3371019	3376886	And Novice Mode's in it now, so, should be interesting, and maybe might change some of your guys' mind on In The Groove.
3376946	3378748	Loki, you gonna give In The Groove 2 a try?
3380390	3381110	You gotta be fair.
3381170	3383471	Come on, you gotta be fair and balanced.
3383811	3386332	Will you at least take a piss on it if it caught on fire?
3386352	3386672	Stop it.
3386912	3387672	Stop encouraging him.
3390393	3393834	Fine, I'll look at it, but it's gonna be the same damn game.
3393854	3395574	It's like, ooh, it's like red now.
3395714	3397114	But it's a pretty new cabinet.
3397154	3401676	But it's a new cabinet, and the fact that it's in a new cabinet means it's not DDR anymore, right?
3401776	3406677	That's what I'm reading on the interweb, is that it's in a new cabinet, so it's not the same game anymore.
3407137	3409698	Actually, that's exactly what it means, because you know what?
3409778	3420422	Cabinets have this thing called JAMA, meaning I can put a Pac-Man game in a normal stand-up cabinet, or I can put a Pac-Man game in a driving cabinet, or I can put a Pac-Man game in a goddamn Guitar Freaks cabinet.
3420822	3422223	It's still the same fucking game.
3422983	3424484	Doesn't matter what kind of cabinet you put it in.
3424984	3425744	You know what?
3426224	3429886	It's like I just said in the chatroom, you know, the first in the group was basically shit.
3430748	3432209	But shit makes the flowers grow.
3432669	3435070	So maybe if we bury this shit, it'll grow something good.
3435130	3438371	You know, the chatroom is not pleased with this track of conversation.
3438791	3439572	Guess what?
3439592	3440452	Too fucking bad.
3440472	3443193	There's about five people here saying stop hating.
3443213	3445474	Those are the only people that bought the game.
3447575	3448555	Boo-hoo.
3449235	3450276	I said I'll give it a try.
3451340	3454321	The first one had good music, but it was just DDR, only crappy.
3454581	3456902	I tried the first one, and it sucked ass, the end.
3457702	3460042	Yeah, it was DDR, only crappy.
3462843	3464404	I can't wait to see the review on Xplay.
3464624	3466164	I want to see the next one.
3466204	3468745	Apparently it's been getting decent reviews.
3468825	3479168	I don't know on what planet in the groove looks better than DDR, because it gave me eye strain after one song, and I never got eye strain on DDR.
3480329	3487457	For the record, I'm still of the school of thought here where in the groove is just another dance game to me.
3487557	3489239	I don't hate it, but I don't love it.
3489380	3493965	Again, it's not as good as the fanboys say it is, but it's not as bad as the haters say it is.
3493985	3497589	That includes you guys, sorry, but I don't think it's as bad as you guys make it out to be.
3500111	3501491	I appreciate the effort.
3501511	3504753	I didn't say it was bad, I just said it was kind of not good.
3504893	3517598	I appreciate the effort they're trying to put into reviving the dance game community, but I just think they made some mistakes along the way, but that's okay.
3517658	3519299	I would have made mistakes too, so...
3520407	3522768	We've made mistakes doing a radio program.
3522828	3524029	It happens.
3524589	3531692	Anyway, if you are a fan of In the Groove, which apparently there are quite a few of you out there listening, because we're getting hate mail already, pick it up.
3531752	3532572	It's out in stores.
3533673	3535594	At least by June 17th, it'll be there.
3535994	3537074	But you might have it already.
3537094	3539415	We just don't know because they're shipping it randomly.
3539715	3542456	In the Groove is only surviving the arcades because there's no new DDR.
3543197	3544037	That's the only thing.
3544397	3545778	Once new DDR comes out, bye-bye.
3546638	3549701	You know, it's like, I could take my hair and dye it purple.
3550281	3552243	Doesn't change the fact it's going to grow back brown.
3553684	3561910	So, you can't, you know, take DDR, add modifiers to it, it's still going to, you know, always play like DDR.
3564032	3564893	Whatever, I'm done.
3565293	3565774	I don't care anymore.
3565794	3566514	Alright, good.
3568576	3570558	I still am going to harass people at Best Buy, though.
3571539	3574260	Oh yeah, they're doing this live tour thing, right?
3574520	3575081	What's going on?
3575661	3576921	Oh yeah, live tour, woo!
3579062	3587166	You know what's interesting, and if you want to find out more information about this live in the groove tour or whatever they're doing, there is actually a website on Myspace.
3587226	3590027	And this is interesting because this goes beyond just dancing games.
3590067	3593509	I know we usually talk about mostly dancing games in the three hour show here, but...
3593993	3600076	This whole Myspace trend for promoting your games has gone beyond just the dance games recently.
3600737	3605439	Donkey Konga 2 has its own Myspace now, which I think is very, I don't know, interesting?
3606700	3607861	If that's the word to describe it.
3609041	3611823	We actually posted the links to both of these on our website earlier this week.
3611963	3616786	Not just the Donkey Konga 2 one, but also a link to the Red Octane page on Myspace.
3617486	3620948	And Red Octane has their own little section of Myspace.com.
3622149	3622269	And...
3624782	3651668	And in the MySpace, they actually have posted all their live shows that they're going to do Because they're actually going to tour in the groove around And I think this probably has to do with the fact that you remember on DDR Freak a few weeks ago They were putting out a call to, they were going to hire, I don't know, Fly Girls or something They were going to be promoting this game, helping to promote the game Well, they're going out on tour, and the tour kicks off June 24th at the Best Buy in Dublin
3652708	3666131	And then it goes on to Santa Rosa on the 25th, Roseville, which is the one near us, on the 26th, which is my birthday, by the way, which means I'm especially not going to be there, and it has nothing to do with like or dislike for In the Groove, but I'm actually going on a company trip, so I can't...
3666536	3667076	I can't be there.
3667196	3669838	Yeah, he's trying to get as far away from In the Groove as possible.
3669858	3670378	Yeah, right.
3670618	3681964	So it's going to roll through most of California, making stops at Anime Expo on July 4th and San Diego Comic Con on July 17th, stopping along some various Best Buy stores on the way.
3682324	3684945	And then it's going to roll through some other conventions.
3685726	3692329	No other Best Buy stores yet, so if you're not into Best Buy in California, sorry you're out of luck, but they're going to various conventions throughout August.
3692689	3696652	Just when I thought Anime Expo couldn't get any worse, I'm proven wrong.
3717659	3719340	So they will be taking that out.
3719380	3724602	So if you want to try In The Groove, maybe you haven't played yet, don't take our word for it or not.
3724682	3725782	Play the game yourself.
3725842	3726603	Make your own decisions.
3726643	3728003	You can go catch them out on the road.
3728384	3737387	And if you want to check out the tour schedule to complete one for yourself, www.myspace.com slash redoctane, all one word.
3738028	3738908	So there you have it.
3740905	3743786	So it should be interesting, to say the least.
3745906	3754028	Let's go ahead and we're going to go to a quick break and then we're going to come back and we're going to talk a little bit about Ultramix 3, specifically a brand new song in Ultramix 3.
3754628	3759749	Also the cage match when we come back a little later and some more stuff.
3759789	3761489	We've got more news for you guys when we come back.
3761529	3764250	In this break we'll do some music from 2DX.
3764810	3768251	We'll start it off with a little bit of Setsugeka from Tent Style.
3768511	3769271	We'll be back after this.
3772219	3772971	Thanks for watching!
3820012	3820834	Thanks for watching!
3995280	3998563	Thanks for watching!
4048576	4048877	and many more.
4096242	4096547	Thank you.
4140459	4141080	DarkSakura.com
4232584	4238411	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
4243328	4247730	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, some music there in that break from the 2DX series.
4249370	4265157	Let's see, starting it off was Ryu with Setsugeka from 2DX10Style, 2DX5Style Consumer Track, C-R-A-C-K-R by Gwashi, and 2DX7Style, Zero One by Mr. T, and finally 2DX Red, John Robinson, K-K-K.
4267329	4268730	What was the last one you heard there in that break?
4270352	4271493	Skype line is open.
4271533	4272815	We decided we'd open it up a little bit.
4272855	4277780	We are going to be doing the brand new song from DDR Ultramix 3 very shortly here.
4278521	4287951	But I figured after that last little bit on we were talking about the In The Groove Home version, I figured there might be somebody who might want to provide a counterpoint.
4288451	4291474	via our Skype line, I don't know, so I am opening that up there.
4291954	4299941	If you want to join us on the Skype line, www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on the little link that says Interact With Us, and that's how you can call in on the Skype line.
4299961	4300421	But you know what?
4301162	4306106	I'm not sure how interactive people want to be tonight, because I'm not seeing a lot of our listeners logged into Skype right now.
4306126	4306907	I say we have...
4311021	4313965	Well, Paris Hilton chat is so outdated.
4314425	4317229	This is sad, and I've got to admit it, okay?
4317970	4326020	Nelly was bored, so she was watching, get this, it was that, oh god, chaotic...
4327523	4331087	I saw way too many episodes of Chaotic, and what did it teach me?
4331107	4333230	It taught me that Britney Spears is a whore.
4333810	4340117	And I already knew that Britney Spears is a whore, but, like, she's just fucking, like, Oh, Kevin Verron!
4340438	4341018	Oh, Kevin!
4341138	4341579	Oh, Kevin!
4341859	4343841	I had sex three times today!
4344262	4345163	Three times!
4345183	4346845	I'm a fucking whore!
4346885	4347686	Da-da-da-da-da!
4348106	4350807	So that's, you know, basically what Chaotic is about.
4350827	4358731	And I was reading just now that Chaotic's actually going to be debuting a brand new Britney Spears video at the end of the show.
4358831	4359492	That's wonderful.
4359872	4362713	So, you know, I figured I'd talk about that stuff.
4362913	4364914	And I was watching the MTV Movie Awards.
4364974	4367135	Goddamn, I don't know why MTV was on all weekend.
4367276	4368536	Again, that skyline is open.
4368576	4370217	You don't have to talk about it in a group if you don't want to.
4370357	4372018	But they had, what was it, they were...
4372458	4375079	They had Jimmy Fallon hosting, which he's not funny at all.
4375459	4377480	And then they had Nicole Richie.
4377540	4379701	She was actually interviewing people on the runway.
4380241	4384963	And it was really bad because she's just like, Oh my God, you're so hot!
4385123	4385883	Oh my God!
4385943	4387384	And it was just completely stupid.
4388044	4389625	I really hated that show.
4389645	4397208	But for some reason, I watched it because I... Why don't you just... If your girlfriend feels like she has to watch this shit, leave the room.
4398569	4399749	We're getting a call on Skype.
4400269	4400809	Praise the Lord.
4400869	4402090	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4403010	4407214	Yeah, I think I was elected by the chat channel to call in and make him shut up.
4408095	4409376	Well, we will do so.
4409497	4410978	Loki, shut up.
4411038	4411779	Tell him to shut up.
4412400	4413240	Yeah, shut up, man.
4413340	4413641	Alright.
4416123	4417124	So, what's on your mind?
4418265	4419206	Uh, drinking.
4420007	4421048	Um, not much.
4421669	4421769	Uh,
4422452	4427016	Basically laughing at people as they bicker back and forth of which dance game is better.
4427436	4429118	I'm kind of the neutral party in this.
4429498	4435323	Now you kind of came into listening to Orange Lounge Radio Live, I'm assuming from our podcast that we do, right?
4435383	4436624	Where we talk about other video games?
4436664	4438005	Actually, yeah.
4438366	4441208	Somebody gave me one of the podcasts and I was like, hey, this sounds pretty good.
4441228	4444351	So I tuned in last week and just liked it.
4444531	4447013	Well, welcome to all our folks who've been listening to the podcast.
4447994	4458483	We do do this three-hour show on Sunday nights, and since it kind of started about Bomani and music video games and music-based things, we still talk about them a whole awful lot here on this show, so it's something you'll get used to.
4458503	4460825	There are a lot of really good music games out there, though.
4461306	4464949	But we have been kind of trying to branch out, as you kind of saw last week.
4464989	4465850	We talk about, you know, just
4466210	4466610	Whatever.
4466690	4468872	Pop culture stuff, other video games we like.
4468892	4473374	Bringing up anything Nickelodeon is insanely cool with me.
4473995	4478477	That was kind of just a weird show last week when we just were getting into Nickelodeon.
4478497	4479358	But hey, cool with me.
4479438	4481619	Chatroom seemed to dig it.
4481659	4482880	So I'm all cool with that.
4483240	4486241	Pretty much anything old school in my book is really good.
4486401	4502049	And there's this whole, like, six degrees of separation thing going on because if you think about it this way, you have Nickelodeon, you have that show Roundhouse, and then the guy on Roundhouse was the MC at Konami's booth at E3 this year showing off the new music games.
4502409	4503189	So, see, it relates.
4503209	4507171	Some kind of six degrees of separation with video games or something.
4507191	4508532	There's bound to be a way to do it.
4508672	4509172	Yes.
4509532	4512594	We could connect anything back to, oh, we're really talking about the money.
4512634	4512974	Don't worry.
4513194	4515176	But can we connect it to Kevin Bacon?
4516177	4520422	Possibly Did Kevin Bacon ever make a guest spot at E3?
4520722	4527989	Well, okay, maybe Gary Coleman was at E3 I don't know, was Gary Coleman and Kevin Bacon ever in a movie together?
4528049	4530132	Gary Coleman was beating up people at the mall
4533376	4534356	Did Kevin Bacon do that?
4534416	4534796	I don't know.
4535476	4537077	Kevin Bacon has gone to a mall!
4537377	4537597	Alright.
4537857	4546599	Well, as our, uh, a person who's calling in who isn't too familiar with the dance and music games, what kind of news stories have been interesting you this week in the general gaming world?
4547279	4552960	Uh, general gaming world, uh, I'd probably have to, well, GTA, uh, San Andreas is out on PC.
4553980	4554301	Oh, yes.
4554381	4555981	I had to admit to it, I'm a freak.
4556001	4557821	I almost beat it and I just got it today.
4558201	4560662	Wow, had you played it on PlayStation 2 or any of that previously?
4561752	4567859	I played it on PlayStation 2 and hated it, because it just didn't feel right to me, so I got it for PC instead.
4567979	4576949	I've heard a lot of bitching about the controls in that game, and I've played a little bit of San Andreas, but most of my San Andreas experience was watching Loki play, because he's better at killing people than I am.
4576969	4578932	The plane missions are a bitch.
4579318	4584760	Well, he also likes to load down the game with cheat codes, and then he'll just skydive with no parachute.
4584800	4586981	I don't know, what kind of stuff were you doing on those flying missions?
4587281	4590842	You used to, like, fly straight into the ground and all this crazy stuff.
4590922	4592002	I wasn't doing that.
4592262	4592842	I don't remember.
4592862	4595703	You can actually chop up people with a propeller if you're good enough.
4595723	4596384	Oh, that's awesome.
4598584	4601565	But one thing I do remember from... I would car surf, and that was fun.
4602206	4606427	One thing I do remember from San Andreas was that the controls were a little...
4607476	4609377	It was a lot for like a little controller.
4609417	4614840	There's so much you can do in that game that the controls get a little convoluted because there's so much you can do with that controller.
4615140	4619803	And I imagine if you can lay that out across a keyboard, it probably makes it a little more... No, same.
4619943	4620683	What do you think?
4621063	4622584	Well, yes and no.
4623304	4629268	For the plane missions, having a joystick is very handy, except they made it so incredibly touchy on the plane stuff.
4629588	4633050	Like you'll just tap it and you'll automatically go craning towards the ground.
4633430	4635111	It's like playing Top Gun on the NES.
4635431	4635531	It's
4636197	4637140	Exactly!
4637862	4638946	It's all about the trainers.
4641314	4650116	Yeah, that's what I'm interested in because I remember watching you play Grand Theft Auto Vice City on the computer and there was that code where you could hit a button and you'd make a car rain down.
4650416	4655256	No, basically what it was, it was I set one button, special moves.
4655336	4658617	Usually there's a code where you can do make all the cars explode.
4658897	4662298	So I mapped that to one key, held it down, and all the cars rocket into the air.
4662358	4665538	Then you let go and start running and dodge the falling debris.
4665578	4666078	That's awesome.
4666098	4666938	See, that's the kind of cool stuff.
4666958	4670279	You can drop like tanks and then you just keep doing a line of tanks.
4670379	4672120	Yeah, tanks, that big tank pile.
4672641	4678185	That's the kind of cool stuff that you can do in a game on the PC that's a little harder on PlayStation.
4678225	4684330	I mean, they have a lot of these same codes on PlayStation, but you can do more config and hacking and all that stuff on the PC.
4684410	4686451	So I think that's the real reason to be happy about it.
4686471	4687152	You know what's quite funny?
4687272	4692696	Up to maybe last month or so, they were still releasing new codes for Grand Theft Auto, like in-game codes.
4692756	4695437	Well, that's a good way to keep your game going, you know, keep it alive a little bit.
4695577	4696958	Yeah, I gotta go back and play.
4697118	4700779	The chatroom's talking about the sex minigame.
4700819	4705701	You always have where you can edit it and change it and add stuff to it.
4705961	4714384	Oh, I was seeing, I saw today on, what was it, on X-Play, they were talking about Grand Theft Auto Vice City, the two-player missions, you can make out with guys in that.
4714984	4715724	Oh, hooray.
4717005	4720125	They're talking about having a mini sex game in the PC version.
4720145	4723526	DarkSakura said the word sex, so I was interested here for a minute.
4723586	4725787	I haven't found out how to do it.
4725847	4727887	I've been trying to find out how to do it.
4728207	4730088	What is up with the mini sex games lately?
4730128	4732368	We had one in Fable, we had one in God of War.
4733008	4734829	It was written into the code, but disabled.
4734949	4735729	It's just funny.
4736730	4739592	It's written in the code, but disabled for the PS2 version.
4739932	4747518	So if they just transferred that over to the PC, I'm sure someone will be able to find the way to, you know, get rid of that so you can actually have sex.
4747678	4748319	Who cares?
4748499	4748999	It's stupid.
4749360	4752382	I mean, have you ever watched, you know, the hooker have sex with you in the car?
4752763	4754924	All it is is the car rocking and she's sitting there.
4755245	4755725	It's just great.
4756583	4760104	You can always do the really old sex joke in playing River City Ransom.
4760224	4763545	You walk behind the girls in the mall and make it look like you're humping them from behind.
4763686	4765946	Dude, can you post those pictures in our chatroom, DarkSakura?
4765966	4766787	They might get a kick out of that.
4766807	4767947	I think those are fake.
4767967	4768567	Are they fake?
4769147	4769508	Maybe.
4770208	4770868	Oh, they are fake.
4771128	4772609	Oh, man, you had me going for a minute.
4772849	4773409	They are funny.
4773949	4774429	Post them anyway.
4774769	4775049	All right.
4775470	4780431	Well, Reznor, we've got to let you go because we're going to get to a song premiere that the Dance Game folks really want to hear.
4780451	4780691	No problem.
4780711	4781692	I'll definitely move aside for this.
4781932	4782212	All right.
4782252	4783452	Well, you have a good one, all right?
4783872	4784173	You too.
4784193	4784393	All right.
4784413	4784853	Thanks for calling.
4784933	4785113	Later.
4786505	4788725	Alright, this is interesting.
4788805	4795327	Now we've got folks that are tuning in that aren't used to the dance game stuff, so we've got to talk about the other stuff too, but that's alright.
4795627	4796327	I like all games.
4796527	4798187	We're game fans first, dance games second.
4798347	4800387	Alright, let's talk about those dance games.
4800427	4805368	We promised you about now we'd be talking about the brand new DDR Ultramix 3 song.
4805428	4812810	Now, I told you guys earlier that Miklatov, even though he's here, you might have forgot he was here because he's actually been playing the Blue DS over there.
4812850	4813770	He can't stop playing.
4814330	4815310	Hi Miklatov, how you doing?
4818624	4820906	Oh, DarkSakura says the second one.
4820966	4824489	I did a little bit of digging on this, and apparently it's a mod you download.
4824609	4826010	All right.
4826271	4829813	Let's get to the dance thing, though, because they're impatient as it is.
4830054	4830314	All right.
4831235	4835038	Even though Mikotov here, he is not revealing this to you guys.
4835698	4839582	He's under NDA, so he can't talk about it.
4839882	4846528	But who can talk about it, and who can talk about when their songs are in the games, are the artists themselves.
4847228	4855071	And sure enough, if you remember last year when DDR Ultramix 2 was coming out, we had TOY, I believe, on his website.
4855131	4856731	He had announced he was doing songs for DDR.
4857732	4861333	Alien613 or whoever had announced they were doing a song for DDR.
4861813	4863934	And they put the background of the song on their site.
4863994	4865134	I don't know how they got that.
4867235	4872597	Mikotov, do you remember any other folks that announced their songs on their website before the rest of us found out about it?
4873911	4878655	I know you're all dying to find out what the song is, but I want to remind you real quick.
4898724	4903086	This ties into an ongoing theme we've had going on for a couple weeks here on this show.
4903386	4904987	Loki just found it on the page here.
4905027	4905748	He's laughing.
4907368	4911911	Loki, what is the theme that it's tying into here on the show?
4913030	4920634	I don't know, I can't troll me with that stuff because I'm so very sad.
4922395	4924536	Are you feeling tragic?
4924816	4929519	I'm so tragic, oh my god, I am so tragic.
4929839	4931420	Oh my tortured existence.
4931620	4940465	Alright, if you haven't figured it out yet, the theme that this song relates to is our gothic talking that we've been doing for the past few weeks here.
4940805	4943947	The artist... Because girls' butts have a lot to do with being goth.
4943967	4946389	Yeah, everybody in our chat room was rooting for girls' butts.
4946489	4947029	Sorry, guys.
4947049	4948450	This actually ties into another joke.
4949071	4950712	I couldn't believe it when I found this.
4950772	4953774	The artist that is doing this song is called Spray.
4954094	4956355	And the song is called I Am Gothic.
4956455	4959357	And they are claiming on their website... I'm going to quote from their website.
4959758	4970245	Their site is over at www.spraynet.freeserve.co.uk slash news.html And I quote from the page.
4972026	4973588	There's a section here that says DDR.
4974149	4988245	Whilst Spray's dream of soundtracking something by Ultimate play the game may never materialize, we have the genuinely exciting news that DDR Ultramix 3 on the Xbox will feature I Am Gothic, the 2003 single mix.
4990387	4992848	So we have a song by the artist Spray called I Am Gothic.
4992868	4993649	We're gonna play them.
4993809	4995630	It's actually available on the internet.
4995650	4996950	We got it off iTunes.
4997270	4998511	You can buy the song on iTunes.
4999211	5002293	We're gonna play it for you guys right now, I guess.
5002513	5003073	You ready for this?
5003513	5005294	Now remember, this is not the DDR edit.
5005314	5008015	This song is actually kind of long.
5008336	5012698	Remember that this song is going to be edited down for DDR when they actually put it in the game.
5013418	5017320	So this song actually clocks in at 6 minutes and 30 seconds, so it's a little bit long.
5017860	5023564	But I think if you listen to it, you can kind of tell what parts will be in the game.
5024384	5026625	You don't have to be Miklatov to know that.
5026645	5027726	You will probably be able to guess.
5027766	5037712	Alright, here it is, the Orange Lounge Radio premiere of a brand new song announced by the artist on their website for DDR Ultramix 3, Spray, I Am Gothic.
5221872	5235005	It's no clue, I'm a freak, I don't like your bands I don't put any effort in, it's just how I am I'm disturbed, I feel hurt, I'm intense, that's me Writing poetry, it's indefinite
5268796	5270325	Thank you for watching!
5300141	5300903	I'm a loner
5412776	5423965	The world premiere here on Orange Lounge Radio of that brand new song from DDR Ultramix 3 as announced by the artist on their website Spray with I Am Gothic, the 2003 single mix.
5426334	5427374	Alright, so there you have it.
5427815	5433917	Now remember that that song, if you thought it was a little long, don't forget that they do edit those songs down when they're put into DDR.
5434777	5442920	So, you know, if you thought it was long, don't worry, they're going to cut out some of the extra parts there and just have the meat of the song in the game.
5443360	5445061	So, Loki, what did you think?
5445381	5445961	I am gothic.
5446282	5446882	It was okay.
5447462	5447702	Yeah?
5448042	5448362	Okay?
5448702	5449003	It was okay.
5451320	5451680	It's okay.
5451920	5463964	I was laughing my ass off when I found out about this a little earlier this week because just because of how it fits into everything we've been talking about on the show lately, I was cracking up.
5464164	5464964	We're psychic.
5465664	5469105	Anyway, the Artist Spray, I actually think they are very funny.
5469465	5472286	Here's the interesting thing about the band Spray.
5472826	5477808	I was kind of perusing through their website where they announced this fact that they're going to be in DDR Ultramix 3.
5478488	5479868	Thank you for watching!
5503027	5504328	Hey, so, wait, am I right here?
5504388	5506430	Ricky and Daz were Space Cats who were a bus stop.
5506450	5506950	Yes, exactly.
5507070	5507230	Right.
5507511	5508191	Now, here's the deal.
5508592	5516318	Ricky, it says Ricardo, who is one of the folks that's in this band, Spray, is one half of pop production legends Ricky and Daz.
5517591	5519212	DarkSakura, you weren't a big fan of the song or...
5542528	5549840	It's alright, it's just generic Well don't forget that it's going to get cut down a little bit as well So it'll be even more generic?
5550501	5553325	No, but the parts that go on and on will be cut down
5555300	5557622	I didn't care for much of it, honestly.
5557662	5558382	I mean, it was okay.
5558442	5560463	I'd listen to it in the background, but I've heard better.
5560664	5566428	We found out Skulk pretty early last year, too, and that turned out to be one of the best songs.
5578680	5579381	Thanks for watching!
5586952	5589914	Some of the lyrics in the song, let me read you some of the lyrics from I Am Gothic.
5590254	5592956	Step inside, candlelights in my depressing gloom.
5593437	5596439	I'm just no brooding teen, I'm considered abstruse.
5597099	5599621	It's so sparse being dark, can't you feel my pain?
5599661	5601923	People are all the same, they isolate my ways.
5602483	5605706	Catch the ghost train to the center of my heart, then the dark will rise again.
5606086	5608668	I am potent, I am profound, then the clouds will part.
5608728	5609348	Here's the chorus.
5609849	5612611	I am gothic, I am pale, I am scary, I'm insane.
5612751	5615813	I'm a loner, I am cold, I feel special when people don't phone.
5616397	5616977	Yay!
5617518	5619259	So I can't get it.
5619319	5629605	Is it like they're satirized, being satirized, satire of goth bands or are they poking fun at themselves or what?
5629665	5630425	I don't know.
5630705	5639911	I think it's just a satire because anything that's synth pop is now seeming to be labeled as goth and they are definitely synth pop so they might be making fun of that.
5640211	5640752	IKILLWITHMYCAR
5660001	5661022	Read a lyric.
5661322	5662963	You want to hear a lyric from I Kill With My Car?
5663363	5672008	Rubber on tarmac, grip the wheel, cold chrome heartbeat, stainless steel, come on baby, take that step, in front of me in certain death, I kill with my car.
5674550	5677491	And then there's another great song on there called Fashion Stigmata.
5678472	5679833	Fashion Stigmata is great.
5680865	5692099	Cause it has singing children in it Yeah, little British children that sing Let me play, I guess I'll play little clips of these songs here real quick Let me play like a little clip of I Kill With My Car here So you guys can get a feel for this
5708820	5718724	You see where that... I don't know, it strikes me as like... I want to see an old woman driving a car with that blaring on... They're poking fun at the goth thing, but they're goth themselves!
5719404	5720885	So it's like, they're just... I don't know.
5721145	5723986	I think Jamie said something when she was in here earlier that kind of seemed to make sense.
5724026	5727067	It's like, they are making fun of how people make fun of goths.
5727427	5728047	Or something, I don't know.
5729608	5734470	Other song titles on the CD, I Keep Missing the Love Boat, and Leave It to the Girls, Boys.
5738354	5739895	I mean, the clip I'll try and get a clip
5773704	5774585	All right, so there you go.
5775065	5776086	I just can't get into this.
5776766	5777547	You can't get into it?
5777747	5780489	No, I like the titles, but I just can't get into the songs.
5780669	5781189	They're awful.
5781850	5783631	You know, we had to look... It's like an Uyvul movie.
5783671	5784291	I mean, come on.
5784351	5785472	It's like... Oh, that's harsh.
5785492	5786733	That is harsh.
5786933	5789575	It's like a good concept, but executed poorly.
5791478	5799327	What's great is that they have a song called Child of the 80s, which is very similar to the I Am Gothic song because it's like poking fun at like, you know, reminiscing of the 80s and everything.
5799847	5806314	And we could have sworn when we were listening to the song for the first time that it was saying suddenly everybody rapes me because I'm a child of the 80s.
5806634	5807836	But it's actually rates me.
5807916	5809858	It's where that little accent comes into play.
5812140	5812461	All right.
5813669	5814890	So there you go, there you have it.
5815010	5815771	I hope you enjoyed.
5816471	5816932	Check them out.
5817092	5822296	I personally recommend the band Spray, but it really depends on what you want.
5823678	5827501	Miklatov, I don't know, is there anything you can tell us further about Spray?
5827581	5830624	Probably not, but only personal thoughts on the band.
5831264	5834327	I think they're my new echo image, which means they're awesome.
5834467	5835968	And you can't say anything about them in the game, huh?
5837209	5837709	That's true.
5837729	5838409	That's true.
5861838	5862639	But it makes sense.
5862719	5866341	I mean, I don't know if this is like a different drum, because they're technically not on the different drum label.
5866361	5870484	They're on this Ninth Wave Records, I think it was Ninth Wave, I want to say was the name of the label.
5870504	5871784	They're on some different type of record label.
5872425	5879069	So it's technically not a different drum, so it makes me think it's a licensed song, and you can't tell me, you're no help as to which one it is.
5879529	5891197	But I kind of see, if it is a licensed song, if we're following that little six degrees of DDR here, going from Bus Stop to Space Cats to Ricky and Daz to Spray, it makes sense.
5891597	5894178	How we ended up from point A to point B. So, there we go.
5896358	5896638	Alright.
5898419	5900699	I'm curious what our chatroom folks thought of that.
5901339	5902179	They probably hate it.
5902879	5903560	They're fickle.
5903720	5908241	Some folks were saying... They were talking about Max in there.
5908481	5908821	What?
5911501	5913002	We did not pay attention, chatroom.
5913022	5915142	People don't come to the chatroom to actually listen to the show.
5915202	5917183	They go there to talk about other stuff.
5918823	5919223	Interesting.
5922658	5925619	This reminds me of Bloodhound Gang's Discovery Channel song.
5925699	5926379	Who said that?
5926919	5928319	Reznor, this guy that just called us earlier.
5928339	5929300	Oh, I don't know who he is.
5929840	5931840	I guess I can't make fun of him if I don't know who he is.
5931860	5936741	But you did say earlier when we were listening to this album in the car, you said it sounded like Eiffel 65.
5936781	5937861	Who did a remix of that song?
5938061	5942362	One of the songs, the very first track on the CD, sounds a lot like Eiffel 65.
5942462	5948003	And it's not a bad thing because if you got over Blue and you actually had their CD, it was a pretty good CD.
5950684	5950924	All right.
5952213	5952813	Hi, DarkSakura.
5953813	5956614	You missed our chat about the band... Good.
5957154	5958434	No, they have a song.
5958454	5959875	I was waiting for you.
5960435	5964076	I was busy holding back the flood and getting two of every animal.
5965176	5965376	Okay.
5967437	5967777	I know it.
5968157	5970557	There's a song called I Kill With My Car.
5970917	5971398	I need that.
5971758	5972458	See?
5972618	5973778	He was telling me about it.
5974358	5976519	I knew she would come around as soon as she found out about that.
5976539	5977479	Your roommate was telling me about it.
5980011	5982013	I'm sorry listeners, but I have to do this for Jamie.
5982113	5983475	I have to play the clip again you guys.
5983935	5984476	I have to do this.
5984976	5985777	Send this to me.
5986598	5987178	I like this.
6003217	6004558	I like this a whole lot.
6004638	6005238	Okay, I need that.
6005258	6008780	So maybe it's just the remix, because that was a remix, the one that's going to be in DER.
6008900	6010681	It sounded too sandstormy.
6011121	6013242	The original version of the song is amazing.
6013703	6016664	It's very, what did you say in the car, Edward Scissorhands?
6016744	6019666	Yeah, because the beginning of the song sounds like Edward Scissorhands.
6019686	6021127	I like music that sounds like a suicide.
6023568	6024268	That's the original.
6024288	6025449	It sounds like Edward Scissorhands to me.
6028095	6031218	Now Reznor is suggesting in our chatroom that you should just name your car Killer.
6031258	6032379	I'll name it Silver Death.
6033320	6033600	Alright.
6034000	6035421	Alright, enough about the band Spray.
6035461	6036402	We've whored them out enough.
6036723	6039245	We hope they enjoy their 15 minutes while being in DDR.
6039565	6040065	But you know what?
6041066	6044069	Really, I haven't heard an album that made me laugh and just...
6045603	6046684	I just really liked it.
6046824	6047384	I really did.
6047444	6049025	It's everything I like about music.
6049125	6050886	It was synth pop and it was funny.
6051006	6052467	I mean, seriously, how can you go wrong?
6052807	6059610	They have a song about, it sounded like being a stalker and then committing suicide and killing the other guy as well so you could be together forever.
6060270	6061551	That was pretty awesome.
6064449	6065990	All right, let's go to a break.
6066050	6069633	And in this break, I'm in a very Akira mood this break.
6069733	6073616	So I think we need to do some Akira Yamaoka this break.
6073676	6076158	So we're going to do that, and then we're going to come back and get into tonight's cage match.
6076478	6079020	And we'll take another call on Skype if anybody's willing to call in.
6079040	6081422	So I'll take a poll and chat and see if somebody wants to call in on Skype.
6081642	6087827	We'll take your calls, get to the cage match, get to the FUs of the week, and all the other gaming news we can dig up after this break.
6088267	6088748	Akira!
6124082	6124824	Thank you for watching!
6209384	6212061	Thanks for watching!
6301955	6302755	Thanks for watching!
6331121	6331782	Thanks for watching!
6396787	6398149	Thanks for watching!
6428194	6431476	We've just got to forever, the brain grass blows and the wind is dancing
6450143	6451224	Thank you for watching!
6471124	6471944	Thank you for watching!
6488610	6489791	Thank you for watching!
6527956	6531660	Orange Lounge Radio We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it
6537148	6560187	Hello everybody, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, we are here, and if you missed it, you missed it, we premiered a brand new song from DDR Ultramix 3, it was Spray, I am Gothic, and we were talking about the band Spray for a little while, and maybe at the very, very end, after the afterbirth, we'll play it one more time for those of you guys that missed it, so stick with us and we'll play it again for those of you guys that missed it.
6561860	6562540	Is your mic on?
6563161	6574568	And I also reminded people on DDR Freak that, you know, because I told them what it was, and I reminded them that they can listen to it also on our rewinds that are on Friday on DDR Freak Radio.
6574768	6575709	Very nice.
6575789	6576249	Good plug.
6576369	6585975	Actually, the rewind for this week won't show up until next Friday because there was a boo-boo and one of our shows got skipped, or
6586536	6587296	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6606305	6607888	I swear we weren't.
6607928	6608690	We really weren't.
6610153	6617067	I don't know how long... Spray doesn't have dates as to when they do updates on their site, so we don't know when they put that up there, but...
6618038	6619078	Probably wasn't that long ago.
6619298	6620699	I figured out the connection, too.
6621179	6622179	Oh, what is the connection?
6622199	6632321	The connection is that the record label, which is quite small, called Ninth Day or something, Ninth Something Records.
6632681	6641063	Anyways, they're a teeny, teeny, tiny label, and they only have a few artists, which all have really horrible webpages, except for Spray.
6641643	6644464	And they're actually sold by...
6645985	6647466	None other than a different drum.
6648546	6650126	Oh, so I think you found the connection there then.
6650566	6651547	Interesting.
6651807	6652107	All right.
6652647	6654988	Which means it's probably not a licensed song.
6655368	6659009	Since if we ask Miklatov, he'll just say NDA, which could mean yes.
6659469	6661130	He's grabbing for a microphone.
6661770	6661970	Was I?
6662030	6663090	I was grabbing for a microphone.
6663130	6665091	Oh, you look like you're grabbing for a microphone.
6665691	6666431	Oh, you're a stylist.
6666451	6666831	Never mind.
6667031	6667511	Screw you.
6668292	6669152	Why are you even here?
6671373	6672673	Wait, Miklatov, he wants a mic.
6674215	6678838	I'm here because I wanted to get drunk last night, and I succeeded.
6681260	6682341	He drunk himself black.
6685243	6685603	All right.
6686543	6687524	DarkSakura, you were going to say something?
6689485	6692588	I think that someone needs to make a mention of the times for the rewind.
6694449	6697551	I would love to, but I think it's 6 o'clock, I think.
6698985	6700408	I don't know very well.
6700609	6701190	You know what, though?
6701270	6705559	I will check DDR Freak's schedule just for you guys right now and have a look-see.
6706581	6709948	In the meantime, DarkSakura, if you want to plug some other shows that we have on Orange Launch Radio.
6710874	6712074	Yeah, I'd like to plug one.
6712094	6712794	Where's my gun?
6712894	6724496	No, I mean... I do public volume on Tuesdays with a music request show, except no one requests anything except randomly going, We want to hear this song!
6724576	6726897	And I don't have it, so I tell you to send it to me.
6727417	6729337	Oh yeah, back to the show.
6729417	6731278	Pre-show starts at a quarter to seven.
6731538	6732738	Official time is seven.
6733238	6734398	Show starts at 7.30.
6734798	6738499	I go to 10.30 supposedly, except I've been kind of going overboard
6739099	6739760	I play a lot of good music.
6750464	6751805	It isn't necessarily a video game.
6775902	6777443	That doesn't involve any of us.
6777803	6783507	I know it's being worked on, and we're waiting to see what it sounds like to see if it's airable.
6785468	6786569	But it should be interesting.
6786629	6788230	I think we should play it even if it's not airable.
6788250	6789771	Either way, it should be interesting.
6789931	6793534	And there's also another show that I brought up.
6793734	6794615	Yeah, you mentioned this before.
6795775	6799578	I'm moving to a new house, so it won't be there for a couple of weeks.
6800739	6804981	But there will be a show hosted by Dan, as in my Dan.
6806182	6807804	and his crazy GameStop buddies.
6808665	6810287	That should be very interesting.
6810307	6811328	GameStop talk!
6812088	6821438	It's going to basically be a when the new stuff comes out his show goes up, he can get it that day and play it for you even early.
6822243	6824925	That's going to be very cool, so something to look forward to.
6825546	6830889	So we are branching out, because I know my new show is going to be General Gaming as well, and that's going to be very exciting, his show.
6831029	6838875	We've also talked about other things, but... There is definitely coming something to the station as soon as next week that's very exciting.
6839355	6842818	It's not a live talk show, it's something else, but it's very exciting nonetheless.
6843639	6844360	I think so anyway.
6844400	6844900	It'll be fun.
6845000	6846482	It's a fun show, if nothing else.
6846762	6855592	I'm doing a special show later on, too, that's going to be fun and have nothing to do with our normal shows, but it just fits because it's nerdy and geeky.
6855712	6857073	It's old school nerdy.
6857133	6858755	I mean, like, old, old school.
6859416	6862039	So it should be a lot of fun and a little retro there.
6862219	6867201	So actually, for those of you that like old school, you are going to love the announcement we have this week.
6867321	6868362	Hopefully this week it's done.
6868562	6869843	You are going to love this announcement.
6869863	6871243	You will poo your pants.
6871523	6872404	Maybe not, but maybe.
6872544	6872964	It's good.
6873444	6873804	It's great.
6874645	6876186	Alright, anyway, so enough talking.
6876326	6880588	Oh, and I was going to mention, our website's awesome.
6880608	6881528	You should go check it out.
6881588	6885930	In fact, we've got a story now about Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories with pictures.
6886270	6887151	Yeah, that's right, pictures.
6887871	6891473	Rockstar is ripping them off other people's sites, but not us, because we rock.
6892193	6893634	So we have pictures for you.
6893794	6894554	Go check them out.
6894774	6895315	It's pretty.
6896415	6899457	We also have the final pictures from Friday at E3.
6901078	6901778	They're all up too.
6902599	6903559	Am I in any of them?
6904540	6905380	No, but a slime is.
6906861	6909302	Yes, I finally got up off my ass and put up all the galleries.
6909342	6911883	So how many pictures total from E3 did you have?
6913204	6915205	About, what, 700 something?
6916586	6918067	Let me take a look.
6918127	6918947	I'll add them up.
6919908	6920328	Wait a moment.
6921653	6922219	Thank you very much.
6924077	6925238	You can talk about how awesome I am.
6926239	6929682	You are... I am such a whore for the camera.
6929942	6930722	Mostly awesome.
6931063	6931503	I'm just kidding.
6932264	6938749	I thought your story earlier was really funny about, because you came in here and you said, I was Noah and I had to collect two of everything and clean up the flood.
6939209	6943633	You were actually being serious because my roommate spilled a gallon of water on the floor in the kitchen.
6944193	6946515	So she really was gone during the whole spray thing.
6946855	6948977	Yeah, I was getting sprayed.
6948997	6951058	Yeah, my roommate sprayed water all over the floor.
6951719	6952459	So it works.
6953540	6956784	These are the kind of hints you're supposed to do before the songs are announced, people.
6965064	6967966	and Thursday... Which, by the way, like 20 of them are the PS3.
6968726	6974569	So, you can check out the PlayStation 3 from like every conceivable angle because DarkSakura got it all.
6974649	6980332	I put five pictures of the... five of the best pictures on the story that I did, which I'll go back and link in the chat room.
6981692	6985234	Just an overview of... Yeah, all the PS3 stuff is on Fridays.
6985614	6988896	Gunstar Superheroes, Magic Online, Kingdom Hearts, that's all Thursday.
6988916	6989276	I have 263 images.
6991657	6992579	and various stuff.
6992839	6998608	I also got the new Dead to Rights for PSP on the Thursday one.
6999749	7002513	Oh crap, I just lost the page.
7002734	7003895	Oh, there we go.
7004236	7006078	Yeah, this is brilliant radio here.
7007039	7009941	and then for... Rob, where are your pictures?
7010441	7011062	They're not up yet.
7011082	7013363	I was just about to say, my pictures are still not up yet.
7013423	7015244	I didn't take quite nearly as many as Jamie.
7015284	7016705	I think I had maybe about 100 total.
7016725	7017345	273 for Wednesday.
7017365	7019646	Including pictures of army parachuting.
7025990	7030793	But what I do have in my picture gallery that I will be putting up soon is I have pictures of booth babes.
7031253	7035595	Because nothing says love into those booth babes like a gay man running around E3 with a camera.
7035936	7037316	So you can look forward to that.
7037536	7039017	I have something that tops that.
7039237	7039598	What's that?
7039838	7041859	I have a sexy picture of Shane.
7042879	7043280	Do you?
7044140	7044640	Yeah, I do.
7044980	7046281	A sexy picture of Shane?
7046361	7049103	If you ever want to know what Miklatov looked like, you can go to the gallery right now.
7049123	7051844	There's actually a full page of PlayStation 3.
7052264	7053045	That's pretty funny.
7053785	7054626	Oh wow, there really is.
7055618	7057340	It's kind of blurry.
7057660	7059002	You're doing a thumbs up.
7063807	7065209	Rob also has another picture.
7065289	7068433	It's a sexy picture of me hugging Mario.
7070515	7073198	I have a story from E3, actually.
7073739	7076322	How Dan scared the living shit out of Miyamoto.
7077591	7078051	How's that?
7078212	7092803	He got up with this thing to be autographed, and just as Miyamoto was getting up to leave, see, he puts his hand on his shoulder, and he gives him this look of utter horror, and then Dan goes, thumbs up with a big old grin, and then he started laughing.
7093383	7094204	So, yeah, he signed down.
7094244	7094504	Wow.
7095085	7095385	Anyways.
7096706	7096966	Okay.
7097246	7097447	Yeah.
7097947	7098588	New subject, yes?
7099168	7099448	Yes.
7099588	7100009	Let's go.
7100209	7100609	New subject.
7100629	7101830	How about the cage match, boys and girls?
7102090	7102591	How about?
7102851	7103131	All right.
7103912	7104172	Woo-hoo.
7107351	7111395	Tonight's cage match, The Way It Works, three songs put into battle.
7111435	7125926	You guys in the chatroom get to vote for your favorite song, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Mamadi Music and Video Game Program, which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, on this stream when we are not here.
7126026	7132752	Alright, the song that is the current victor is a song that has been in the victory circle for two weeks now.
7133112	7134412	It's halfway to retirement.
7134733	7136333	We haven't had a retired song in quite a while.
7136373	7141695	So this might be, I'm sure Jamie would be thrilled being the fangirl that she is to get this song retired.
7142375	7144655	But it has to happen with your guys' help.
7145276	7149497	And, you know, Loki and I are going to do our best to take it out.
7150404	7153485	So, yeah, we'll see.
7153545	7153886	All right.
7154446	7154766	I don't know.
7154806	7157948	Tonight, I know what I picked, and I know that you're very last minute.
7158248	7161809	I don't think we're going to be giving this song much competition tonight, but you never know.
7162330	7162630	All right.
7162710	7163210	So here it is.
7163730	7165671	Song number one, a clip of last week's winner.
7165691	7167892	You only get to hear a clip because you've heard this song already.
7168332	7172534	It's the Gorillaz, and the song is their next single from the album Demon Days.
7172934	7173795	It's Dare.
7292340	7293144	It's there.
7318926	7324571	Alrighty, that was song number one, two weeks, going for a third win tonight, Gorillaz with Dare.
7325152	7329896	Alright, we don't get to rate that song, we're going right into the next one, because it already won, so you already know it's good.
7330316	7341386	Alright, the next song is my pick, and I'm being really adventurous with my pick tonight, because I really think that you guys are going to kind of be really weird with this one.
7341926	7345709	But, you know, I don't know what to say, like...
7346670	7356741	This artist is somebody I would never consider putting in the cage match, but the production values on this song are surprisingly really good.
7357301	7363347	And to take a person like this, and to produce a song that is...
7364315	7365796	Kind of infectious in a way.
7365916	7366956	It's kind of impressive to me.
7367016	7370237	So therefore I'm giving it a cage match spin to see what you guys think of it.
7370857	7373979	And it was co-written by the chick from Four Non Blondes, which I think is cool.
7374259	7375159	So, because she's cool.
7375399	7376259	Alright, so here it is.
7376920	7378820	The artist, brace yourself.
7378860	7380921	Now don't hate this song just after I say the artist.
7381501	7382922	The artist is Kelly Osbourne.
7383882	7385963	And this song is One Word.
7386323	7386623	Okay?
7387023	7387924	So give it a chance.
7388044	7390105	Don't hate it just yet because it's kind of dancey.
7390485	7390965	Check it out.
7391025	7393606	Kelly Osbourne, One Word, here on the cage match.
7399642	7401382	See, even my computer doesn't want to play it here.
7401422	7402583	Let's try this again, kids.
7403243	7406284	This is Kelly Osbourne with One Word here in the Cage Match.
7407804	7408064	One Word
7431713	7432554	Thank you for watching!
7460700	7487445	The silence tells me all I need to know One word, one word Tells me everything I need to know One world driven into madness Madness driven by the depths below One word, one word Tells me everything I need
7506574	7531641	One lie tells of thousands of years The greatest stories that were ever told One lie, one lie Tells the greatest stories ever told Once man can predict the future A future journey into outer space One fan, one fan
7535467	7537529	A future journey into outer space
7564679	7570242	It's not the way that I want it, it's just the way that I need it Day after day, day after day
7647823	7652445	All right, that was song number two in tonight's cage match, Kelly Osbourne, One Word.
7653285	7656226	And now we get one vote from each person.
7656286	7658907	Actually, not a vote, but one judgment.
7659007	7660928	One judgment from each person here in the room.
7661168	7664949	DarkSakura.
7665589	7669811	Well, I heard this in your car last week, and I liked it.
7670051	7670911	It's okay.
7671031	7672692	It is, though, really repetitive.
7673612	7673752	And...
7675960	7680265	She doesn't really sound like herself through all the synth and everything, which I guess might be a blessing in disguise.
7680926	7681427	I think so.
7683649	7685632	It would be a background song for me, honestly.
7685732	7686353	I give it a...
7689313	7690953	I'm being really nice to give a seven.
7691574	7694135	Me personally, I think it's great.
7694255	7702939	Kelly Osbourne, okay, the rock thing really didn't work for her, so she can't sing so well, so let's find a genre that fits perfectly for people who can't sing that well.
7703199	7705340	Let's revive 80s new wave, it works great.
7706440	7708141	So I like it, so I give it an eight for 80s.
7709142	7714024	Loki, she needs to get her dad to fucking sing with her, because at least that would be cool.
7715485	7715945	Honestly.
7716494	7719884	I have a music file of Ozzy Osbourne doing Stayin' Alive
7720296	7721757	Oh my god, that was fucking awesome.
7721797	7722097	I heard that.
7722117	7722657	That was great.
7722737	7722997	Great.
7723017	7724838	Hey, hello, Cade, I gotta bring that in.
7724878	7727379	All aboard the disco chain!
7727459	7727779	Hello.
7728040	7728780	I'm bringing that in.
7728820	7730060	Hello, one word, one word.
7730381	7730781	Oh, one word?
7730801	7731141	One song.
7731441	7732161	It was okay.
7732421	7736443	It was just kind of, it was, it was very, um, boring.
7737344	7739405	And I don't like Kelly Osbourne at all.
7739965	7742386	And, um, it was just kind of, eh.
7742566	7745187	It was just, I don't know.
7745207	7749009	She could keep doing that same genre because it's not as bad as, like, say, I don't know, um,
7750140	7755944	Lala, or something like that, you know, I know that's not Kelly Osbourne, but just as bad, and trying to be rocked.
7756104	7758646	Oh, you make me wanna la la, that one?
7758666	7768833	Yeah, this 80s, not 80s, this pop rock crap that they're doing now, not good, okay, it's crap, but it's good to see you're going in a new direction, so I guess I give it a 7.
7768953	7770114	Alright.
7770234	7772856	Miklatov, something you can talk about tonight, for once.
7773176	7774157	Kelly Osbourne, one word.
7774477	7777720	It was okay, um, kind of boring, I think that's the theme.
7778700	7778880	Uh, 6.
7780524	7780905	All righty.
7781486	7782948	Let's get into song number three.
7782988	7786773	It's Loki's song, and he refuses to tell me the name, so he will be doing the introduction.
7786813	7788615	So Sal will be doing the introduction.
7788776	7790338	Now, this song, it's...
7791084	7796867	I did two remixes today, one of them being a remix to Dropout, which we're not playing, and the other remix is to Skulk.
7796887	7800449	This is Echo Image Skulk with, um, oh god, what the hell was the name of this?
7800489	7800729	It was...
7819449	7820690	Nobody Understands Mix.
7820771	7821451	That's what it was.
7821571	7824054	Okay, so this is Skulk, the Nobody Understands Mix.
7824715	7825195	Interesting.
7825315	7825676	Alright.
7827237	7829219	You want to talk about what you mixed it with later?
7829740	7834225	It's a lot of different versions of Skulk put together and also some other songs and stuff.
7835565	7842970	There's some things I would have loved to do to it that I couldn't do, and so, you know, I see all the flaws in it, you know, going into it, but it's... Way to sell it.
7843410	7852116	Hey, I'm sorry, okay, because I don't want to just, you know, pop out mixes that are just something you're going to see on Bomani Style, you know, like some of the crap that's on there.
7852577	7855999	So I'm really picky on the stuff that I want to release out there on the internet.
7856019	7858701	That's why the dropout thing is not ever getting released on the internet.
7859521	7860262	But we'll hear that later.
7860302	7865045	Anyways, this is Echo Image, Skulk, the No Ending Your Stands mix.
7868566	7892772	The fragments of my soul Make me understand what I've become The falling like I always did Make me take control About the weakness, is it that You're leaving me to find what I have lost My heart beats with a boundless pain
8037968	8039129	Thank you for watching!
8119033	8124803	Alright, Loki there, remixing Echo Image with Skulk, the Nobody Understands mix.
8124943	8130592	Let's see if the judges, us, were able to understand it, or we just didn't get it.
8131213	8131614	DarkSakura.
8132981	8135322	It was overall good.
8136562	8141944	I think that the music overshadowed, it was imbalanced versus the lyrics.
8142944	8144265	It was actually pretty imbalanced.
8145305	8156749	I thought that the beat itself on the first measure could have, at the beginning of every measure, could have been a little bit more subdued because I started getting headaches.
8157049	8160190	Which is how I do it whenever any song does like that.
8160270	8161591	It doesn't matter what song it is.
8162569	8169635	Um, it was, though, solid with a little tweaking, it could be a 10, so I, for right now, give it a 7.5.
8171317	8171637	Loki.
8172338	8177902	Exact same thoughts, because I have the same problems trying to pull just, you know, vocals out of there.
8178343	8182366	Can't really do that if I don't have a vocal track, but I work with what I got, so, you know, I give it a 9.
8184029	8202763	Um, I, you know, I would think that Loki and Echo Image colliding would be like an instant 10, but for me, like, some of it was just like too busy, like the middle part of it was like too much, like I think I felt the Jamie thing was like, oh my god, there's like too much here, um, but I think for what he had to work with, Loki did an amazing job, I think what it is, is it's
8203403	8213267	The beginning of a really, really good mix, and if Loki could get the original samples and stuff, he could clean it up a lot, and it would totally, like, just blow us all away.
8213327	8232275	It's hard because when you're working with, like, three or four different tracks at once, mixing them together on top, and only one has a vocal track, pulling the vocals out of there is impossible, and I've tried the best I could to, like, subdue the other tracks while I have a vocal track going, but it's, like, extremely, extremely hard to do, and that was, like, the best I can get after a couple hours today.
8232529	8234290	I do have a piece of advice in general, though.
8234691	8237973	You know those drum beats that get louder as they go?
8237993	8239654	You use those quite a lot.
8239694	8241315	Yes, I recognize that, too, in this song.
8241355	8243777	You use that in every single mix!
8244518	8245839	It's just temporary stuff.
8245899	8246239	Alright.
8246599	8247179	You know what, though?
8247500	8250722	It's a start to something absolutely brilliant.
8250762	8252223	I think that a simple crescendo would be good.
8252463	8254825	These people should be contacting you to remix their stuff.
8254845	8254825	7.5.
8254965	8255505	Uh, Mikotov.
8259511	8268979	It reminded me a lot of the extended mix that is on Amazon.com that when people first heard about Skulk, they were downloading and thinking it was going to be in the game.
8270160	8274023	Not overly fond of that one, but it was still decent nonetheless.
8274484	8274824	Seven.
8276245	8278547	Alright, let's recap, kids.
8278607	8279928	It's not up to us, it's up to you.
8279948	8284392	Here are the three songs you get to vote for tonight in tonight's cage match.
8285373	8287715	Song number one you can vote for tonight is Dare.
8298415	8307204	And song number two you can vote for tonight is Kelly Osbourne with One Word.
8315512	8323219	Alright, and song number three you can vote for tonight is Echo Image, remixed by Loki, Skulk, the Nobody Understands mix.
8335487	8337870	All right, place vote now.
8337970	8346079	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote for song number one, song number two, or song number three.
8346159	8347981	Or you can call them by the artist or name.
8348362	8349143	I'm not retarded.
8349163	8350604	I'll be able to figure it out each way.
8350765	8352667	We should play my other song since it's on the CD.
8353027	8354408	We will get to that.
8355288	8357970	However, I want to give you a chance to talk about what's going on in the synth scene.
8357990	8358930	In the synth scene?
8359650	8359891	Nothing.
8360991	8364793	And sadly enough, I wish I had something to talk about, but there is nothing.
8365153	8368715	So instead, I'm going to talk about something else, and that's diverse systems, D9's coming out.
8369335	8376979	I still haven't figured out a way to actually be able to order the rest of them, since their English page only goes up to D6, which I have everything from that back.
8378300	8386947	So, I'm going to maybe try, because I hate experimenting with sending them money, especially since there's that language barrier there.
8387667	8394152	I'm going to try to order something that's not on their order page, that's on the Japanese order page, and see if they send it anyways.
8395893	8396914	And hopefully they do.
8397214	8399896	If that's the case, because there's a lot of CDs I've got to catch up on.
8400116	8406541	The whole D7, D8, and then since D9 was announced, and then there's, you know, was it Hello Mr...
8409035	8409435	What was it?
8409536	8414118	Desire and Hello Mr. Taka, I think, or something like that.
8414399	8416740	So, those we still need to get.
8416760	8424665	But they've announced the stuff for D9 already, and there's a lot of remixes from 9th and 10th style in it so far, so it should be interesting.
8425866	8427707	Alright, so that's pretty much it for the sim scene.
8427915	8428516	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8451542	8452583	DarkSakura has something...
8468641	8469502	DarkSakura's WTF News
8489822	8493843	It didn't turn out to be as good as I thought it was going to be.
8494323	8496244	This is a B-side remix of Dropout.
8496464	8497825	I don't really have a title for it.
8497985	8499005	It's just kind of interesting.
8499045	8504627	The problem with it is, for one, I couldn't do much with Dropout and the song.
8505047	8511529	And when I slowed the first song down to be about Dropout speed, it didn't sound right.
8512649	8517351	You can listen to it, it's okay, but it's never going to be on the internet to download.
8517451	8520332	So this is the dropout B-side mix, I guess.
8520492	8525294	I guess, because it's about, it's like, you know, like how we did, what was it, Acid that one time?
8525834	8531736	It was an okay remix, it's not anything I'd be proud of or like be out there, you know, say, hey, look at what I did.
8532036	8538999	This is just like kind of, okay, I did it, you know, I started it, I finished it, just to get it done, so then, you know, moving on.
8539019	8539939	Is this on the MySpace?
8540632	8540752	No.
8540972	8541152	Okay.
8541733	8543494	Plug your MySpace, though, for folks that are into this.
8543555	8555245	If they liked your Echo Image Mix and they liked this... If they like the Echo Image Mix, when it's done, finally, it will be on my MySpace page, which is myspace.com slash LokiFusion, all one word.
8555765	8556506	And you can check it out.
8557046	8558507	How many friends do you have now?
8558768	8560369	I have about 17 friends.
8560429	8560849	Woo-hoo!
8561410	8563632	People that I've... They're just random people.
8563832	8564212	Good.
8564272	8564973	So that's kind of neat.
8565673	8568415	But yeah, Myspace.com slash LokiFusion.
8568475	8569096	You can check it out.
8569116	8570517	I made a little cool banner for it.
8570637	8574820	And my page doesn't look too bad, so it's pretty nice.
8574860	8575300	Check it out.
8575721	8580504	Right now we've got the Ecstasy remix, because that's my favorite.
8580804	8589410	We've got the Battle Without Honor or Humanity, the 88 Severed Limbs mix, which is on there.
8589450	8593633	We also have, which some people are saying they couldn't find before, the Radical Faith...
8595681	8597544	Final Judgment Mix, I think is what I called it.
8598064	8598925	And that's on there as well.
8599165	8599906	Alright, so check it out.
8599946	8600327	Here it is.
8601068	8602129	Premiere of Dropout.
8602149	8605213	Probably the only time you'll hear this.
8605273	8606814	Dropout, the B-side mix by Loki.
8606975	8607155	Enjoy.
8713035	8715717	Why I'm not going to put that on the internet.
8715797	8716177	Yes, Loki?
8716497	8719159	I said, you can see why I'm not going to put that up on the internet.
8719219	8721000	Some of the folks in the chatroom kind of dug that one.
8722121	8722501	It's okay.
8722981	8725182	It's nothing I'd be proud of.
8725202	8725543	Alright.
8725963	8726243	Alright.
8729585	8735109	DarkSakura, while I tally up the cage moach, make cage moach, cage match votes over here.
8735129	8735930	Love that cage moach.
8736050	8737071	Yes, love that cage moach.
8737931	8746258	She is going to bring you the WTF report where, you know, it's just a story that you could only find somewhere out there on the internet.
8746298	8750141	So, DarkSakura, what do you have to share with us in the WTF report?
8751517	8763831	Um, there's an article, actually I found this on DDR Freak, but it was on Yahoo News about an international robotics show that they do in Japan.
8765212	8768136	It's at the Aichi World Expo in Nagagude.
8770359	8782784	Anyway, they had a humanoid robot with a skin-like substance, a working mouthful torso, it moves as though it's breathing, it sits and acts as a tour guide.
8783684	8791807	But apparently the robot was so realistic looking that they were pretty much afraid of it.
8791827	8793908	You know, what does this represent for the future?
8793928	8795789	So I'm going to post a link to...
8797369	8801012	There's actually a good slideshow from the whole thing, so I'm going to post this picture.
8801492	8802673	And you should look through the slideshow.
8802713	8804894	They have ballroom dancing robots.
8805394	8807535	They have robots that will do your kitchen deeds for you.
8807595	8812899	They show pictures of the bomb squad robots, which I've actually, they have employed in Israel already.
8813519	8818342	The question that everybody wants to know, though, was she a pleasure model?
8820583	8821184	You know what?
8822825	8823185	Shut up.
8824020	8824940	I've actually seen this.
8824960	8827041	This was on Engadget earlier this week.
8827061	8827881	It was pretty cool.
8828782	8830722	The whole thing about the robots too.
8830762	8836484	They had a caption contest for the picture with the two ballroom dancing robots and that was funny.
8837464	8840525	What are these strange looking gloves the robot has on her hands?
8840585	8842266	Maybe it's to prevent those types of things.
8842346	8842806	I don't know.
8843655	8845256	Maybe her hands are just not finished yet.
8845496	8849217	But you know, the thing is that I saw this and I was thinking about the movie that I saw last night.
8850078	8851078	iRobot or what?
8851678	8851858	No.
8852338	8870766	I went to go see, well I don't want to spoil it because it's going to be on Syfy in a couple months, but I went to see Bruce Campbell showing his new movie, doing like a 40 theater tour in the United States of a film he did in Bulgaria.
8871326	8873747	Call of the Man with the Screaming Brain, based on the Dark Horse comics.
8874927	8884671	But the thing is that it's hard for me to say this because there is an android moment in the movie, and the robot just made me flashback since I saw it last night.
8884711	8888992	You know what that robot reminds me of, and it's completely not having to do with robots at all?
8889492	8897075	It reminds me of this really crappy Japanese show called Hey Mikey, where it's all... Hey Mikey was done like Thunderbirds was.
8897635	8899316	It's all with mannequins.
8899657	8903499	Not, you know, like the little puppets or whatever.
8903519	8906481	We're talking full-size mannequins and it was creepy as hell.
8907462	8909103	I gotta buy that DVD.
8909283	8910824	That was kind of like today's special.
8910864	8912766	I hate to bring up the Nickelodeon thing two weeks in a row.
8912786	8913446	I love today's special.
8913486	8915327	But today's special was the mannequins were coming to life.
8915347	8916788	Remember the 80s movie, Mannequin?
8917309	8920451	Yeah.
8920511	8921492	Mannequin 2 was bad.
8922492	8923213	Mannequin 2 was bad.
8923233	8924213	The first one was actually kind of good.
8924233	8924314	Okay.
8925452	8926172	How do you know they don't already?
8926192	8927033	How do you know they don't already?
8927053	8928373	How do you know they don't already?
8928393	8929753	How do you know they don't already?
8951411	8951871	Bad joke.
8952812	8953873	Yeah, the ferret lives among us.
8953893	8957176	Here's how I know they don't already, because there's too many retarded people out there.
8958857	8959337	Honestly.
8959718	8960699	Bad programming.
8960759	8962020	They haven't got it right yet.
8962200	8963761	Maybe the robots are meant to do that.
8963781	8967004	I've been programmed to make live to my sister.
8967804	8968505	No, no, no, no.
8968545	8973469	There's a difference between being a full-on physical robot and just being a walking automaton.
8973789	8978213	You know, if they cloned a sheep first, maybe they will make a robot of the pleasure sheep first.
8979366	8980627	You know what?
8980867	8984888	Would having sex with a pleasure sheep be just as shameful as sex with a real sheep?
8985148	8986229	I think more so.
8987389	8988950	I love animals.
8989010	8990351	But it's not a real sheep.
8991091	8992772	Mikotov, you love sheep.
8993932	8994933	Do you love animals?
8995993	8998374	Sheep are one of my three phobias.
8999094	9000235	It's really sad.
9000895	9001595	What are the other two?
9001795	9003076	Flying bugs in water.
9004096	9005277	That's four then.
9006843	9008144	Flying Bugs, Water, and Sheep.
9008284	9008724	That's three.
9009504	9011025	Flying Bugs, Water, and Sheep.
9011065	9012026	Flying Bugs.
9012226	9015327	Oh, like those huge Brazilian cockroaches.
9016588	9020770	You don't want to go into Alabama, though, because my mama got chased down the hall by a flying Brazilian cockroach.
9021691	9022371	It was really nasty.
9022471	9028234	Yeah, what happens, though, if you find a flying sheep that's insect-like and it happens to be sitting in a pond?
9028314	9031376	I mean, that's just got to be your worst nightmare right there.
9033280	9035100	Cheap or tasty, that's all I gotta say.
9035641	9038001	Man, lamburgers, mmm, yummy.
9038601	9040922	Wait a minute, one of your fears is water, Miklatov?
9041602	9042082	He's saying yes.
9042342	9043602	Then I have to ask, how do I microfest this?
9043622	9045903	I have to ask, what do you think of Ultramix 3's theme, then?
9046003	9047583	Ha ha ha, bubbles!
9048903	9049423	Stupid.
9051884	9054844	Alright, Ultramix 4, the theme's gonna be shiny lights.
9055465	9058005	To pick up, you know, the mentally challenged audience.
9059705	9062326	Because Ultramix 2, did it really have a theme?
9062834	9063154	Blue.
9063735	9064715	Blue was the theme.
9064835	9065836	Oh, I'm sure that made you happy.
9065856	9067877	The theme is dance game.
9068078	9069238	This will be the ultimate theme.
9069459	9075162	It'll be bubbles, and then glitter, and then ecstasy.
9078012	9080193	I wonder how many of those Ultimix games will crank out, man.
9080333	9080813	It'll be crazy.
9081433	9081973	Alright, anyway.
9082493	9084894	Let's talk about tonight's cage match winner, boys and girls.
9085694	9091956	The winner of tonight's cage match... It was no small vote tonight, kids.
9092016	9095236	You guys pretty much voted this one in somewhat of a landslide tonight.
9095677	9098717	It was song number... Three.
9099738	9101778	Loki remixing Echo Image.
9103559	9104879	Skull, how did this win?
9106055	9116241	Because our chat room has a huge boner for Echo Image, and they have a huge boner for you, so when you put two and two together, they can't contain it at their erection anymore, and it just comes all over the place.
9116261	9119383	I wish that it would have lost so that I could put the good one in later.
9119764	9120064	Oh, well.
9120084	9120824	You know what's funny?
9121085	9128649	I was going to be bringing a different song for Cage Match, but I forgot my stupid flash drive that I have.
9128990	9132812	And what's funny is I've tried to bring that song two times, and both times I've
9133132	9133512	DarkSakura
9152058	9155620	Dark Knight in the chatroom is asking, has Loki's remixes ever took a loss?
9155680	9157520	And I do recall that you did lose at least once.
9157540	9158341	Oh yeah, a couple times.
9159941	9160862	I don't know what it was, though.
9161682	9163743	I am not a very good Orange Lounge Radio historian.
9164443	9167284	DDR Angel, who hasn't been here for a couple weeks, I hope she's alright.
9167724	9169225	I'm starting to worry now.
9169245	9171186	I'm going to call the police if she doesn't come next week.
9172306	9176608	But she's a very good historian of the show, so when I have questions like these, I can ask her.
9176768	9179569	The last one, I think, was Legend of Trance 2005, maybe?
9183917	9184518	F.U.s of the week
9205563	9206664	So we'll be back after this.
9206684	9211869	We're going to start off this break with some Akumajo Dracula medley from Keyboard Mania.
9211909	9213671	We'll be back after this with the FUs of the week.
9213711	9215333	If you want to start sending those in right now, you can.
9215393	9216214	We'll be back after this.
9323395	9324580	Thank you for watching!
9355055	9356277	Thank you for watching!
9455347	9455969	Thanks for watching!
9588809	9589769	Gaming Radio.
9589989	9597252	So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
9597452	9598792	Orange Lounge Radio.
9599672	9601893	He should be a foreign correspondent for us.
9602153	9603534	That'd be awesome.
9603874	9604854	I feel naked tonight.
9606269	9607570	I have all my clothes on, don't worry.
9607590	9608910	We didn't turn off the webcam because of that.
9608930	9610571	We turned off the webcam because the webcam was crappy.
9611011	9612892	Because the room is really dark.
9612912	9615714	The room is too dark and the webcam is not that good.
9615774	9617774	So when we get a better webcam, we will bring that back.
9617794	9618315	We promise.
9618675	9622697	We might even get one of those freaky remote controlled ones where you could control it during the show.
9624318	9625399	I'll hide over here.
9640373	9644496	All right, so what we're going to do now is we're going to get into the... Oh, the reason why I feel naked.
9644536	9644816	Hello.
9645076	9647798	The reason why I feel naked is because I don't have headphones this week.
9648798	9651560	I broke them last week, and I have yet to go get new ones.
9651600	9652241	I keep forgetting.
9652401	9658104	Like, I remembered at Target today that I needed new razors and all that other stuff, but I forgot to get headphones because I'm a dumbass.
9658725	9660006	I feel naked.
9660086	9663728	I can't hear myself in my ears, and therefore my ego is saddened.
9663928	9665409	And I forgot to mention earlier that
9665836	9667657	TheCoachCarter came to my work.
9690046	9690547	Grr, argh
9713917	9716459	The motherfucker who keyed my car.
9717200	9719982	I hope you have a plague of gnats inside your testicles.
9723786	9727029	Also, you know, I'm really not too angsty because I love my car.
9727745	9729507	My car fills me full of joy.
9730148	9736836	But, you know, for you people who think, oh, I'm gonna pass the Lancer, fuck you, okay?
9737036	9737516	Fuck you.
9738297	9740520	My car kicks your ass.
9740980	9743904	Except for that special edition Corvette that passed me yesterday.
9746074	9759723	and FU to Krispy Kreme because yesterday I had my cheat day and I ate three donuts and they were damn good but I got sick because sugar makes my stomach hurt a lot.
9761244	9762245	www.darkskura.com
9787495	9788235	F you to moving.
9788655	9791656	Where I'm glad to be getting out of my crap hole apartment complex.
9793397	9796498	It's the whole packing all of my stuff up that sucks.
9796998	9798539	It makes me a little depressed too.
9799199	9804141	But overall, I think the biggest F you for moving is the dust.
9805261	9807562	I'm gonna lay down the law on the new house.
9808322	9810583	Their house will be regularly dusted.
9811363	9811803	And that's all.
9813864	9815345	Let's move on to Loki.
9817560	9818361	If I can here.
9822323	9825025	You know, I hate Britney Spears.
9825845	9828927	You know, she just needs to fall off the face of the earth permanently.
9829888	9833070	I just, I don't know what it is about her, but she fucking sucks.
9833854	9853806	Hater, and fucking you the goddamn Final Fantasy XI, going down, you know, how am I supposed to ignore my family and friends and play an online game if you keep, you know, DNS crashing on me, so, oh well, I guess short doses for Final Fantasy, and then, um,
9855287	9867036	Finally, fuck you to Round Table for your smokehouse combo pizza because it was actually pretty tasty, but it has barbecue sauce on it, so that just doesn't fit.
9867056	9868457	I don't know.
9868898	9874442	Oh, and fuck you to my apartment because the stove, for some reason, smokes uncontrollably, and I don't know why.
9874722	9875543	We have to figure that out.
9876123	9877524	And that's without anything in it.
9880727	9883549	That's pretty much all that I have to deal with right now.
9886624	9887125	and I'm done.
9887445	9888126	Alright, then my turn.
9893453	9897058	I want to give an FU to this show that they have on MTV.
9897158	9900463	First of all, I want to give an FU to the fact that I was even watching MTV at all, but I was really bored.
9900783	9903387	But I want to give an FU to this show on MTV called Next.
9904090	9906451	Because it's the biggest piece of trash I've ever seen in my life.
9907271	9908992	It's so obviously scripted.
9909012	9912194	Like, this is why people hate reality TV is because of a show like this.
9912514	9917596	And what I really hate is I really hate its portrayal of gay guys because it makes them look all like whores.
9917996	9925199	Because when they're like ready to speed date or whatever, the guys who are waiting to speed date are all too busy on the bus making out with each other.
9925260	9926980	And I'm like, you're all a bunch of whores.
9927300	9927961	But to be...
9928901	9933047	On TV, dating strangers that you know nothing about is kind of whorish anyway.
9933367	9939295	At least they're giving away money so I can kind of sympathize with them a little bit because I do crazy shit for money as well.
9939775	9943179	But F you to MTV for having crappy shows like Next.
9943700	9945102	So, that's it.
9945785	9947286	I think that's my only FU of the week this week.
9947346	9949227	I've actually had a pretty decent week, I can't complain.
9950007	9952809	Alright, Mikotov, what do you have for us tonight?
9955370	9956811	Oh, yay, Lion Suki.
9958031	9960392	I have an FU to NDAs, because oh my god.
9961333	9962333	Seriously, guys.
9962974	9963774	NDAs suck.
9965295	9968797	FU to... That sounded like a good oh my god, though.
9968837	9971238	Like, oh my god, I want to tell you something, but I can't.
9972384	9974345	NDA.
9975305	9978306	FU to the crappy EB employee today.
9978626	9986129	Now I have love for EB since that's where I came from, but EB guy today was just complete jerk and rude.
9986889	9992351	And the GameStop guy was just a little better, so FU to EB.
9993132	9999654	FU to Mario64, it's a crappy game but I can't stop playing it on my DS because it was free.
10001461	10007267	and FU to having to work tomorrow and FU to being drunk last night because that was painful.
10007307	10009489	That was funny.
10009569	10020459	It was cool when I wasn't in pain because that drinking game we played, King's Cup, was funnier than anything until I had to drink a lot during it.
10021581	10024243	But, yeah.
10024263	10024343	Who?
10028013	10030675	That was just a random thing.
10030916	10033438	I'll tell you later.
10033578	10037702	At E3, the guy with the really long hair who was up there playing DDR.
10037782	10038843	This was one of his cosplays.
10038883	10039763	I'll put it in the chatroom.
10039783	10041565	He's at Sunnyvale Gauntlet all the time.
10041765	10043266	Yeah.
10043306	10044447	I've seen him as Kai.
10045128	10045849	F you to him.
10046509	10048050	Ruining Kai from Guilty Gear.
10049211	10049712	And that's it.
10050553	10052434	Alright, let's get to the chatroom, shall we?
10052454	10054336	Because our chatroom is especially angsty tonight.
10054356	10055477	Um...
10057469	10062290	OMGitsDoobz, although he's under the guise of OMGtitsboobz, but whatever.
10062951	10066692	FU to SSJ100, Matt, and MPQ for being such whores about my new name.
10066772	10067212	Suck it up.
10067292	10068612	Oh, I was just a whore about your name, too.
10068632	10068852	Sorry.
10068972	10070473	Hey, I came up with that name.
10070613	10071013	That's right.
10071173	10072934	FU to Orlando for being so damn shitty.
10072974	10074634	It's just a waste of 14 hours of my life.
10074794	10076255	FU to Wangang... I'm sorry.
10076715	10079396	Wang... Wagang... I can't pronounce this word for the life of me.
10079516	10082437	Wagang... Wagang... Wagang... Wang... Wangan?
10082757	10083977	I think maybe... Wangan?
10084417	10085417	He missed a letter, then.
10085738	10086558	Wangan Midnight 2.
10087938	10088719	Wangan, whatever.
10089119	10090300	That game, the race game.
10090680	10098047	Because of it, I don't like Initial D Arcade anymore and F you to Malaysian people and MMOs because their English is just as annoying as the English of Brazilian people.
10098827	10100349	That was good and racist.
10100429	10103712	He also says, oh, and F you to O2 Jam for having such bad songs.
10103772	10104112	I hate it.
10105985	10109048	Moving on, Yuki would like to say, F you to work being so dead today.
10109468	10112831	Much as the money would help with my credit card payment, I just wanted to be sent home early.
10113152	10113692	I know the feeling.
10114433	10117135	StarTetsuya says, F you to AOL and my phone line.
10117175	10118657	I missed half the show because of it.
10119538	10120559	America Offline.
10121459	10125383	DJ Dark Knight says, let me just flat out say it, F you to gas prices.
10125523	10126244	Oh, and an F you to work.
10127401	10133367	SSJ100 Matt says, F you to real life work for keeping me away from this show and games in general.
10133587	10134328	F you to emo.
10134888	10136470	F you to the New York Yankees losing.
10136550	10138051	Laugh now, but they will be back.
10139693	10144117	MPQ says, F you to myself for forgetting about the show last week.
10145198	10147120	LemonLimeJump says, F you to my town.
10147400	10147781	Period.
10149130	10153773	Reznor says, nice fuck you to people that think Honda Civics with bling can outrace anything.
10154153	10158496	And another F you to anyone that thinks any NES game sucks because of the graphics.
10161298	10162619	What about Bubble Bath Babes?
10162739	10164300	The graphics were kind of shitty in that game.
10164921	10167582	And the game could have been a whole lot better if the graphics were better.
10167883	10170985	That game was too damn hard for boobies, okay, honestly.
10172537	10172797	All right.
10173177	10176038	Illusion says major, major, major F you to In The Groove shipping.
10176098	10179138	Not an F you to In The Groove, but an F you to the fact that I didn't get my copy.
10179558	10183319	My friend doesn't order things online, so she gave me her money to order the game for her.
10183659	10186180	So both copies of the game were supposed to ship to my house.
10186520	10190101	But only her copy shipped to my house on Friday, driving me mad with anger.
10190801	10192221	F you to only three people going to carry it.
10192241	10194581	And then you get to keep your copy, and she has to wait for hers.
10194621	10195842	That's the way it works, buddy.
10195862	10197562	All right.
10198607	10200268	Interesting question in the chatroom there.
10200328	10204711	Vid Palace says, Did you know that AOL has a video game radio station?
10205412	10207353	Did you know that ours is better?
10208073	10209735	Did you know that we don't give a flying flip?
10211075	10212857	Did you ever know that you're my hero?
10215118	10216459	You're everything I wish I could be.
10217260	10218561	Can you fly higher than an eagle?
10220302	10221503	I am the wind beneath your... Stop it!
10221643	10222923	Stop it right now!
10224224	10224685	God...
10228141	10228501	All right.
10230062	10232463	I almost want to play something from old school NES, but I'll wait.
10232583	10235345	I'll wait for another appropriate occasion to do that.
10237466	10238066	Let's see.
10239147	10239867	What can we do now?
10240127	10241188	We could do some Ask Orange Lounge.
10241228	10242889	We don't have any questions in yet.
10245190	10246410	We're starting to run out of show here.
10246430	10247411	We're running out of steam.
10248131	10249452	And I don't have no post of the week.
10249572	10250973	Do we have another news story?
10250993	10251753	Do you have something, Loki?
10251773	10253654	I guess we're just going to have to talk about other news.
10254588	10255313	I know, it sucks.
10255957	10257930	I have dead skin on my feet.
10259568	10262629	That's breaking news, folks.
10262709	10266530	PSP, Homebrew on version 1.5 PSP.
10266570	10267650	That means all you U.S.
10267670	10273712	people that have been waiting for Homebrew games and all the Japanese people have been rubbing it in your face, it's coming.
10274292	10280413	It's going to be released supposedly on June 15th at 3 p.m.
10281333	10282054	General Mountain Time.
10282634	10286835	And what's cool about it is what they're saying right now is it's only running on version 1.5, so...
10287975	10289776	Do you mean Greenwich time?
10290657	10291037	Whatever.
10292037	10292458	Never mind.
10292898	10293798	Just poking fun.
10294619	10295099	Kiss my ass.
10295119	10295499	I don't care.
10296120	10301783	All I know is it's coming out in a couple days and that makes me happy because I'll be able to run crappy stuff for the PSP.
10302003	10306106	I'll be able to put all my Game Boy Advance games on the PSP.
10306526	10308807	How's that for irony?
10309187	10310988	So basically, yeah, it's going to be coming out.
10311008	10311769	It'll be cool.
10312270	10316179	And they've got MAME working for it right now, so you know what that means I'm going to try to do?
10316961	10318805	Oh yeah, that's right.
10319427	10321933	We're going to be putting on the porno games.
10325241	10327162	All the gals panic I can possibly handle.
10327462	10329623	More to look forward on that on the podcast.
10329663	10330583	Yeah, check out the podcast.
10330603	10331424	Yes, check it out.
10332444	10333444	I have to do this story.
10333484	10335505	It's something you actually posted at the site earlier this week.
10335545	10336606	This is too damn good.
10336646	10340967	I can't believe we haven't brought this up on the show earlier because we probably could have gone off for about a half hour on it.
10341587	10342968	You posted something on Tuesday.
10343028	10347350	It has to do with Dance Dance Revolution being mixed with fire.
10347790	10348090	Yes.
10349030	10350291	Now, Jamie, don't get too excited.
10353478	10361987	Dance Dance Immolation is the name of the game here and you can actually go to this website here and the way this works, what is Dance Dance Immolation?
10362548	10370997	It's an adaptation, this is from the website interpretivearsen.com slash ddi actually is the name of the site here.
10371677	10377263	Dance Dance Immolation is an adaptation of the popular arcade video game Dance Dance Revolution, but with fire.
10377843	10379385	Basically, you play DDR.
10379705	10383408	When you do well, the computer shoots big propane blasts up in the air.
10383889	10386872	When you do poorly, it shoots you in the face with flamethrowers.
10387312	10389394	Yes, you as in your actual body.
10389754	10392237	And yes, flamethrowers, like the kind that are on fire.
10393564	10396768	Now before you freak out here, this is what they say, wait, isn't this dangerous?
10397149	10406702	Before you play, you'll put on a fully aluminized proximity suit with a forced air respirator, gloves, fireproof hood, the whole bit.
10407022	10409926	These are the suits that are used for fighting fires at airports.
10411075	10415839	So basically, you suit up and you play DDR, but if you screw up, you get shot with fire.
10416079	10418081	Some more info on this.
10418161	10423525	Okay, now the website right now, they just have their testing, their homemade flamethrower that they made.
10424366	10426928	So it's not actually gameplay shots or anything like that.
10427389	10431431	However, there was another post on the DDR community in Live Journal.
10431451	10433152	They had some more pictures of the same thing.
10433572	10448379	But what's going to be happening is they actually have a computer running Step Mania with Firebase theme and Firebase songs, like Burning Heat, Burning Up For You, My Fire, stuff like that.
10448559	10449679	So it's going to be running Step Mania.
10449920	10452541	If you want to play this, you've got to go on the Burning Man.
10453550	10454471	How appropriate.
10454591	10457774	Burning Man, and there's also some fire festival, I guess, in Oakland or something.
10457834	10460116	I never got Burning Man.
10460176	10463899	Like, I understand it's a big thing that all these people go to the desert for.
10463919	10466541	I don't get it, so to speak.
10467942	10473007	I don't know if this is representative of what goes on at Burning Man, but let's just say you aren't selling any tickets with this, okay?
10473467	10479472	I mean, this is the kind of stuff I would expect to see, like, on Jackass, but, like, I don't know, even crazier.
10479553	10480714	I'm just waiting for the lawsuits.
10481836	10483177	I don't think there'll be a lawsuit.
10483217	10486318	I mean, these people probably do this with other crap all the time.
10487059	10492141	If people are stupid enough to suit up, I'm sure that they have disclaimers out the ass.
10492161	10493262	I'm not talking about them suiting up.
10493302	10496203	I'm talking about stupid kids lighting themselves on fire.
10498304	10500045	Because they see this on TV or something?
10500305	10501726	Or they see this in action?
10501906	10502886	They see this on the internet?
10503006	10503667	I guess, yeah.
10503687	10505988	Well, maybe parents ought to, you know, take responsibility.
10506048	10507289	Keep fire away from their kids.
10508169	10509670	Parents just don't understand.
10511192	10512493	You know.
10514075	10515757	So, very interesting.
10515797	10518560	If you're interested in fire and DDR, maybe this is the thing for you.
10520122	10521423	Dance, dance, what was this again?
10521503	10521964	Immolation.
10526147	10531789	And of course they have a PayPal link on their site because, you know, you couldn't have this without a PayPal link.
10531809	10537531	And the festival that they'll be showing us at, the Crucible's Fire Arts Festival in Oakland in July.
10537871	10540072	Who knew that there was a whole festival about fire?
10540572	10541953	Jamie, you should be going to this.
10542433	10546315	I would so... You know, I'm actually on the website right now.
10548515	10551437	I would be afraid that, like, in order to go, they would, like, shoot you with fire.
10551477	10552437	I know people who've gone.
10553067	10554211	Oh god, that scares me.
10554953	10557401	I mean, fire's cool and all, but not when it's on me.
10560390	10567056	Yeah, I want to do, like, Dance Dance, Hydro... Hydronization or something like that, where they shoot water.
10567076	10568057	How about a Super Soaker?
10568117	10572280	That's a little less harmful, but of course a Super Soaker gets on the pad and then it, you know, ruins the whole thing.
10573021	10573641	Softpad.
10573722	10574602	Slip and slide.
10574702	10575923	Softpad, there you go.
10576504	10577585	Slip and slide DDR.
10577705	10578946	Oh my god, that's so cool.
10578986	10581388	You're tripping and falling on the bar and breaking bones.
10581889	10582829	Hilarious!
10586773	10587033	All right.
10587987	10590008	I think that's going to do it for tonight's show, boys and girls.
10590048	10593129	Thank you very much for tuning in and listening to Orange Lounge Radio tonight.
10594090	10595110	We've got to wrap it up, though.
10596170	10599452	We've got a lot of stuff to do after the show tonight, such as tape a podcast.
10599512	10600672	We know you guys like the podcast.

10605634	10606034	Yes, Jamie?
10606215	10608595	I'm going to try to scare the shit out of you in my car.
10609276	10610036	Okay, how so?
10610396	10611016	I'm going to drive.
10613638	10613898	All right.
10614538	10616879	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
10618634	10646382	Loki, your final thought my final thought is I hope what they're saying about the PSP is true and then I'll be able to run homebrew games on Wednesday because I've got there's not that many games I want to buy and the emulators rock so go homebrew hoping for Stepmania ported to the PSP because I don't know because IndieGroove needs a PSP version or not
10647307	10648508	Miglitov, your final thought.
10650509	10654011	I like blue alcohol, blue DSs, and Russian boys.
10657514	10663598	My final thought is... I don't have one.
10663698	10664078	I'm sorry.
10664138	10664518	I don't have any.
10664558	10665019	Chirp, chirp.
10665139	10665579	Chirp, chirp.
10665639	10666300	It's blank.
10667640	10673064	My final thought is reject false icons and my car owns you all.
10674185	10674425	All right.
10675154	10677096	for the last word of the show.
10677296	10679038	One word to sum it all up.
10680159	10681201	Thank you for listening, everybody.
10681681	10682282	See you next week.
10682462	10683083	DarkSakura.

10903382	10907125	Alright guys, I promised that after the show we would play this one more time.
10907145	10909547	I'm actually going to play the original version of this though.
10909927	10915812	It's very similar to the DDR one, but it's just a little shorter, a little less instruments, but same idea.
10915852	10918174	So if you guys didn't get to hear this earlier, you'll still get an idea.
10918194	10919995	And those of you that did hear it, it's something a little different.
10920315	10927201	So this is the album version of the new song we announced tonight, because actually Spray was the first to announce this on their website, the artist.
10927941	10929523	I Am Gothic, the original version.
10929583	10929823	Enjoy.
10935087	10935651	Thank you.
11155771	11158273	Okay, there was the original version of I Am Gothic.
11158733	11162876	So, should be an interesting next few weeks as we start to learn some more.
11162896	11167559	Actually, I should say next few months as we start to learn more and more of these songs that we will be doing the DDR to.
11167579	11169821	Until next time, have a good one.
