289	2830	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of June 27th, 2005.
2930	14354	You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
14634	18596	Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
19516	28259	Hello, everybody, once again, and welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, our 26th episode, if you can believe it.
29649	36752	Uh, the podcast dedicated to those video games that don't suck, and well, sometimes we do have to talk about some that do, but not very many.
36892	37853	We try to keep that to a minimum.
38353	40254	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
40594	46157	Join me as always, my awesome co-host, in this quarter, the happiest bunny on the farm, DarkSakura.
46197	46657	Jamie Summers.
47337	49258	You know, the ones that suck are the ones we make fun of.
49698	50099	Of course.
50399	52380	We have to bring them up so we can tease.
53240	55101	Bash them into a pulp of...
55990	59876	Broken silicon and wires and knotted plastic.
60116	67948	And then of course a reoccurring theme that's come up a lot lately are the games that are being turned into movies that we get to bash into a bloody pulp and all that stuff.
67988	68649	Don't get me started.
68669	69991	And I have another one to talk about tonight.
70458	70898	Joy!
71099	71619	Joy, Joy.
72120	74502	Also joining us, Techmaso, one and only Loki!
75082	75563	I am here.
76223	76704	How you doing?
77485	77925	I am here.
78265	78826	Alright.
79587	80027	Here we are.
80127	80588	He's there.
80828	81869	Yeah, he's there, you're here.
81989	82549	We're all here.
82649	83570	This is me in the corner.
83730	84531	In the person.
84811	85912	That's me in the spotlight.
86093	86533	Yeah, great.
87854	98619	Um, just a reminder, Horns Launch Radio To Go Edition is actually brought to you in MP3 Pro encoding, so if you don't like the way this sounds on your iPod, that's because iPods don't have the MP3 Pro thing.
98939	101020	I wish they did, but maybe they'll get that in the future.
101540	106882	Um, but if you listen to this on, like, Winamp or whatever, you can get a MP3 Pro codec and this show sounds even better.
107302	109683	You can hear us in full stereo and everything, it's great.
109803	112925	Anyway, just thought I'd throw that out there because I haven't talked about that in, like, oh, 25 weeks or so, so...
114065	115005	I played one quest on PSO and that was it.
115025	115886	I did the caves.
137287	138088	I did the caves.
138508	139028	How'd that go?
139449	143752	Well, this thing is how I have a full power mag at the time on the level 11 character.
144412	145373	I'm level 13 now.
146253	150696	I was just like, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die.
150797	152898	How's PSO going now that it went pay?
152978	154779	Is there a lot less people on there?
155140	155920	I haven't noticed.
155960	158102	I always play by myself or with people I know anyway.
159062	159783	It's PSO.
159963	160984	Same thing it always was.
161324	163025	We're supposed to have Ep 4, though.
163045	163966	I need to check that out.
165003	166366	I picked up Destroy All Humans.
177802	188128	You know, remembering that you also ran out and bought Alien Hamed, and you like these Invader Zim-ish, alien, taking over the world type games, doesn't surprise me one bit that you ran out and bought it.
188148	192911	Well, the only reason I bought Alien Hamed is because it reminded me of Contra and Metal Slug.
192951	194272	That's the only reason I bought that game.
195453	201537	But, no, Destroy All Humans was basically for the... It's the same reason I bought Dog's Life.
202077	211204	In fact, this game reminds me of a dog's life in a lot of aspects, except for the fact that you're an alien and the other one you're a dog.
211544	218249	This alien has the ability to throw stuff telekinetically, which just offers endless playability right there.
218349	223253	You can just pick up chickens, throw them into walls, pick up people, throw them against the ground.
223813	225634	Pick up a cow, throw it into the air.
225974	228495	Help me understand this game a little bit because I've seen the commercials and everything.
228515	232096	So I understand that you play as an alien who is destroying all humans.
232356	232616	Why?
232816	233016	Why?
233156	233957	Why are they killing all humans?
233977	234917	Why are they destroying all humans?
234977	235177	Okay.
235437	240079	Well, basically what happens is this race of aliens or whatever, they're from some distant planet.
240839	247702	And a long, long time ago when they destroyed the Martians or whatever, they got pissed off or whatever and came to Earth.
247722	250623	They found that it was very primitive and whatnot.
250663	251443	So they inject it.
252523	254764	Some of their DNA into the early humans.
255164	261666	And since their race has no ability to reproduce, they have to clone themselves.
261746	269088	And after a while, generations and generations, their clones have become inferior to what they used to be.
269148	276530	So now they've come back to Earth to extract this DNA from humans and at the same time just destroy the whole planet because, you know,
278079	279440	Destruction for no particular reason.
279460	280680	That's because that's what they do.
280720	281961	That's why they destroyed the Martians.
281981	283402	Sort of like Jamie driving in her new car.
283842	284302	Hey!
284342	284882	Just kidding.
284942	288464	You were in my car with me today and I didn't kill anybody while you were there.
288624	289604	Although you wanted to.
290285	290925	Stupid van!
292384	293024	The Movie Man.
316938	339685	um, there's, you've got the missions that you're supposed to be doing, but after you finish the mission, you're still in the level, so you can collect, like, what's left of, there's, like, um, these hidden, almost, like, um, they're, like, uh, probes or whatever you have to find, and then that unlocks some other stuff, and then you can also extract DNA from the people, and that you can use to upgrade your ship, upgrade your, you know, abilities and whatnot, um,
340785	341506	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
362130	363890	Oh yeah, definitely go play it.
363910	366031	There's not much in July, so it's a good game.
366211	368472	For everybody to play or for a certain audience?
368872	369652	Oh, it's for everyone.
370372	371392	Honestly, just go play it.
371612	372513	I mean, it's a lot of fun.
372673	373933	Even if you don't buy it, rent it.
374013	374453	It's great.
377954	378234	I'm done.
378814	386997	I got a call actually today from Dan while he was at work asking me if I wanted a black Labrador, a miniature Dachshund, or a Chihuahua.
387737	388517	You're getting a doggie?
389005	390006	I'm getting a Nintendog
410000	410460	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
433530	436833	The US ones, you can unlock the Japanese dogs.
437174	446382	And also, for example, if someone has the Chihuahua one, someone has the mini Dash Hound, and you, I guess, interact with the Chihuahua one, it unlocks the Chihuahua one on yours.
446402	448644	So we should all make sure we get different ones when we get the game.
449024	449925	Is there a Shih Tzu?
450826	452047	Yes, there is a Shih Tzu.
452067	454970	I have to get a Shih Tzu just so I can say, I have a Shih Tzu.
454990	456992	It's technically Shih Tzu.
457212	457993	I like Shih Tzu.
458013	459054	Yeah, pah.
460949	465473	I almost picked the Dachshund, but I like the Black Labs.
466714	467534	I'm still waiting for Nintendo.
467554	470317	Labrador Retriever, Chihuahua, and me, Dachshund.
470337	475681	Speaking of DS games, my gaming week, what I got to play this week was Bomberman DS, which I am...
476161	477502	Super Bomberman 2 on Super Nintendo
499908	501009	I do remember the old Super Nintendo.
501029	502169	There were like four of them on Super Nintendo.
502189	504130	Well, you had the multi-tap.
504310	515935	Well, if you're a Bomberman fan, this is pretty much classic Bomberman, but the very cool thing, I love what they did with this Bomberman DS is that you can play eight-person multiplayer, one cartridge.
516595	523318	None of this, everybody's got to have the cartridge to play the game, because the DS is wireless and everything, you just send the game over and eight people can play off one cartridge.
523358	524039	I think that's awesome.
524579	528981	And this is what else I love about the DS here in this game, is that
529423	531446	It's not touch at all.
532247	533729	It's using the two screen thing.
533769	541279	I think you can, like you can set the controls to use the touchscreen if you want, but I'm loving it now that the games aren't feeling the need to whore the touch thing
542102	542662	incessantly.
542942	548324	Like they're actually coming up with good games that use just the two screen feature and that's what Bomberman does because there's eight people.
548784	551305	Now you have eight corners because there's the two screens.
551685	553245	So it works out pretty well.
554186	556646	Graphic wise it's just what you expect from a Bomberman game.
556666	560628	Probably a little better than what you saw on Super Nintendo but you know it's Bomberman.
560708	562228	It's not going to revolutionize the graphic world.
562988	568670	And it's just, it's a fun, it's a very good handheld game because handheld games are supposed to be the quick and easy
569150	569850	I had my birthday.
587061	596345	On the 26th, I know, I don't want to talk about my age, but some of my friends got together and bought me a PSP, which was very cool, so I have a PSP now.
597665	609590	And of course, the very first thing I did with it, because I don't know if you guys were listening to this show a couple months ago, but I actually picked up a copy of Luminous before I had a PSP, and I just let my friend borrow it, because I'm like, you can't get a PSP and not get Luminous.
609790	611270	I will buy it for when I get a PSP.
612451	615952	Well, he still has my copy of Luminous, unfortunately, so I have nothing to play on my PSP right now.
616332	625654	So the very first thing I do with my PSP, I fired up the homebrew page on the internet and I downloaded some Nintendo emulator and some ROMs.
625934	627254	Dan's been going crazy with that.
627494	628054	Oh, it's awesome.
628074	629334	We've got a gigabyte memory card.
629574	630015	It's awesome.
630895	633055	So yeah, he's got something like 50 ROMs on it.
633255	642837	It kind of works out for Sony in the long run too because Nintendo's been selling some of these games for $20 a pop and now people can play them for free on their PSP, although...
643331	649834	It's one of those things that nobody's supposed to talk about, but this kind of thing has to be a selling point for the PSP.
650755	651355	For some people.
651955	653336	For me, it definitely sells it.
654056	655797	So, Loki, I'll let you start tonight.
655917	658158	I know you probably... I kind of spoiled it there.
658199	665122	We've got the no-swap trick there now for the emulators, but what else is new in the hack-and-crack scene?
665362	668764	Well, that was pretty much the news this week, was that the...
669488	678414	New Exploit was released on Wednesday, I believe, and it's basically not very different from the last Exploit.
678494	693364	You basically have two folders on one memory card, except one of them has a percent sign at the end of it, and you basically have your two sets of e-boot files, and it just runs off your memory card now.
693505	695466	No need to swap, just go.
696181	697142	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
713251	714211	No, 152.
714691	715712	That's the Japanese one.
716932	717392	The U.S.
717412	717852	one's 152.
718132	719232	And guess what, folks?
719492	726094	But they're working on 151 and 152 already, and it's going to be a matter of time before that's not even an issue.
726314	728574	It's going to be like Trillion and AOL.
728634	734215	Like every time AOL patches their server so Trillion can't use it anymore, within two days Trillion has a workaround.
734235	736096	It's just going to be the same thing.
736476	736896	It's great.
738297	741859	So yeah, it's been major news, actually.
742099	745860	There's been some cool homebrew games coming out, you know, some Blackjack Casino stuff.
746001	746661	That's kind of neat.
747441	750923	Actually, another thing that was pretty interesting was...
752302	757246	Game Boy Advance Simulator for the PSP.
757486	757946	Full speed?
758747	759428	Runs pretty good.
760128	763831	It's limited to files that are under 8 megs.
764852	765813	The ROMs have to be under 8 megs.
765893	767094	The Nintendo one's not perfect.
767114	771897	The Nintendo one, I noticed, wouldn't play Life Force, which is one of my favorite Nintendo games, and it wouldn't play Gyruss.
772077	772638	So it's
773214	773754	It's not there.
773774	774074	It's not there.
797916	803320	Actually, Dan tried the Game Boy Advance one and it ran Fire Emblem like crap.
804541	806442	He said it ran it so slow that it was a torture to play it.
810856	811797	So you didn't bother with it.
812258	813079	I don't know.
813139	825055	Now that we're seeing that the things get this advanced, you've got to go, well, you know, if Sony is going to try and screw with people so that their firmware is going to be forced to upgrade, you really can't blame them because this could get ugly.
825195	827197	Well, it technically is money out of their pockets.
827338	827578	Yeah.
829040	831241	It's going to get ugly if this stuff gets too mainstream.
831742	836846	The other thing I was going to mention is the game coming out later on this year, the Summer Burnout Legends.
837026	843832	One of the unique things about it is it will be able to share a demo level with other people via download play type thing.
844953	849177	So that's kind of a first also for the PSP, which is kind of neat.
849918	856163	And I know that's already been built into it, and you'll be able to download games and whatnot, hopefully to your memory stick.
856969	874673	and so that'll be coming out with Burnout Legends and then also really there's some good games coming out I know Midnight Club 3 just got released so that's going to be coming out next week so you can pick that up and then a bunch of cool stuff coming out, MediEvil they're working on
875762	877403	So it's a good summer for PSP.
877663	878084	Very cool.
878604	895276	One quick question I just want to pose to you guys, and those of you that are listening at home as well, I'm kind of curious, with the news about the Nintendo emulation and everything, usually people say emulation is not a bad thing because you're only playing things that you can't buy in the store anymore, and that's kind of, that's like the justification, you've seen this.
896039	903886	Is this Nintendo emulation ethical considering that Nintendo is still trying to profit off some of these old titles through their GBA Classic series?
904007	904387	What do you think?
904967	910673	From a support standpoint, you know, it is not ethical, I believe.
911073	911734	Because technically...
913581	918522	All right, like example, they're re-releasing Zelda.
918562	919042	That's out.
919462	921563	But say that you have an emulator to play it.
922023	926524	That is however much, say $35, that Nintendo's not going to get.
926684	930225	Now say that this is you times about 100 other people.
930525	932986	That's $3,500 that Nintendo's not getting.
934130	940113	That means that any future game that comes out is going to jack the price because they have to make up for loss of sales on that.
940153	947778	I know that they figure this in when they set price points, but the thing is that the price is going to keep going up the more that this goes on.
949244	949705	Counterpoint?
950266	955273	Counterpoint is they shouldn't be trying to resell fucking the first game of Zelda in the first place.
955353	959099	I'm not going to pay $20 for a game that's been out for years now.
959419	962404	Why should I have to buy some stupid game to run on the Game Boy Advance?
962544	964587	I'm going to run a damn emulator and play it for free.
965302	969325	and that's my take on even their other stuff with the new Revolution.
969445	971407	Big whoop-a-dee-doo, there's new graphics.
971867	973748	Yeah, and this kind of leads into one story.
973828	974269	You know what?
974369	979012	I would rather play every release on my Game Boy Advance than play an emulator.
979833	983876	Technically, I could just plug in my Nintendo and play it all I want to.
984036	989840	It's kind of like, if I'm hearing you right, it's kind of like downloading MP3s from the internet and buying them off iTunes.
989980	991941	When you buy something off iTunes, you know you're going to get...
993703	995264	or another service, a comparable service.
995324	1003310	When you use one of these services, you know you're going to get the highest quality file.
1004891	1011556	As opposed to when you try to use LimeWire, you're going to get fake files, crappy sounding ones, people trying to mess with you and stuff.
1012191	1014413	Is that kind of how it is with ROMs versus the real thing?
1014433	1015313	I'll pay for quality.
1015774	1016554	I'll pay for quality.
1016574	1025821	The one thing that I do support ROMs for is for games that have been heavily edited and games that are just not coming out over here.
1025901	1028182	Then I will run a translation patch on them and play them.
1028202	1030404	Like translated... Like Seiken Densetsu 3?
1030444	1031164	Seiken Densetsu 3, yeah.
1031345	1031585	Okay.
1032065	1035608	Like the first Fire Emblem on the Game Boy Advance.
1035628	1036228	They never brought that.
1036288	1037249	The one with Roy and Marth.
1037829	1038790	Never brought that out over here.
1040211	1046695	My thought is, you know, I owned the Zelda cartridge back in the day, so I feel justified in emulating it.
1046715	1055780	Now, granted, maybe I'm playing some other things I didn't necessarily own, but I don't know, I still feel like, you know, I'm buying enough of their new stuff, and usually if they...
1056880	1063763	Bring out Zelda Redone, or I'm trying to think of some of the other games that they've redone recently.
1064224	1067365	Maybe Metroid Zero, but that's a little loose because it wasn't exactly the first game.
1067445	1068726	I buy that stuff right up.
1068946	1071127	But if you think about it, you asked if it is ethical.
1071447	1072788	No, it is not ethical.
1074048	1075089	Is it logical?
1076209	1076869	Yes, it is.
1077090	1077690	Okay, fair enough.
1077710	1078130	But ethical?
1078370	1078590	No.
1078910	1079551	Nobody's perfect.
1080498	1090812	Your thoughts at home, welcomed to go at OrangeLoungeRadio.com If you want to send us an email, to go at OrangeLoungeRadio.com I think it's ethical because they're not putting Nintendo games in the new Animal Crossing DS.
1091773	1092635	It's damn ethical.
1093035	1094016	No, that's not ethical.
1094036	1095619	That's the difference between ethics and logic.
1097082	1099864	You are going from a logical standpoint and not an ethical standpoint.
1100184	1103606	And trust me, I took three semesters of philosophy, so I should know this.
1103686	1105247	Martha Stewart went to jail over this stuff.
1106088	1106528	I'm just kidding.
1106568	1106849	All right.
1107109	1107589	Let's move on.
1107629	1108450	It is not ethical.
1108530	1109250	Let's move on.
1109290	1109771	Let's move on.
1109811	1110071	All right.
1110111	1112332	Your thoughts, again, to go at orangelaunchradio.com.
1112372	1113173	To be continued, maybe.
1114733	1116014	Zelda DS, huh?
1116274	1117994	Or we will publicly break you on the air.
1118654	1119695	Zelda DS.
1119755	1121135	They are working on one.
1121375	1131158	And in an interview with Wired Magazine, the Legend of Zelda producer says that the Nintendo DS version of Zelda will be primarily controlled via the touchscreen and stylus.
1131638	1135339	To which I say... Sigh.
1135379	1135879	Exactly.
1137100	1137500	Now, I'm...
1138638	1144902	I can't judge till I see it because, you know, Castlevania DS has the stylus thing, but it's tasteful.
1145103	1146183	It's limited.
1146724	1148425	It's not overboard with it.
1148605	1149386	It makes sense.
1149686	1153168	So I'm hoping that... One word.
1153348	1153729	Okay, what?
1154129	1154669	Harumph.
1156931	1158692	Just... I don't know.
1159533	1160233	I'm a little scared.
1160293	1162635	I have to see more on this, but this news does kind of make me go...
1163803	1165905	Do they have to whore this out in every game?
1166245	1169087	Well, you know, they did build it into the system for a reason.
1170488	1173610	But isn't one of the other selling points supposed to be the two-screen?
1173630	1177053	That's like saying, God damn those Nintendo games and using the goddamn A button.
1177133	1178974	Why does every game have to use the A button?
1179795	1180716	It's there for a reason.
1180736	1181256	They use it.
1181456	1182677	Think about classic Zelda.
1182717	1187361	You would never have to hit the menu button again because you could always have your menu on the top screen.
1187861	1188602	That's all you need.
1188902	1190323	And that's being innovative with the DS.
1190563	1191143	Well, that's right.
1191163	1194245	They called it the DS, not the S. For Stylus?
1194605	1194985	Exactly.
1195045	1197206	Or the TM, Touch Me.
1197366	1197686	I don't know.
1199227	1199967	TMFM.
1200487	1201187	Touch Me, Feel Me!
1202648	1203208	TMI.
1204549	1206149	You know, we were talking about movies last week.
1206169	1207770	We were talking about all the movie games that are coming out.
1207830	1209411	And by the way, we got a correction.
1209471	1214333	The postal thing that's going to be directed by Uwe Boll, not really going to be directed by Uwe Boll.
1214353	1214533	Or it's
1215720	1216661	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1232538	1234920	We've got another game that's going to be made into a movie.
1234960	1236301	We kind of knew about this one for a while.
1236402	1239004	American McGee's version of Alice.
1239084	1240565	You know, like Alice in Wonderland.
1241566	1245830	You could say it's Tim Burton meets Tarantino meets just a big bag of crack, basically.
1246170	1247471	That's how you could describe Alice, I guess.
1247511	1247812	I don't know.
1248292	1251455	And you have to have a really happy computer to run it.
1252863	1255025	A few years, when a game first came out, you did.
1255085	1257487	Now it's, most computers could probably handle it.
1257767	1262712	Well, they're making a movie out of it, and they have casted Sarah Michelle Gellar, the one and only Buffy.
1262732	1273121	You know what, woman needs to eat something, because in The Grudge, she was like bone thin, and she was really in good shape when she was on Buffy.
1273722	1273882	Mm-hmm.
1275069	1278111	You know, because she consistently had to exercise for the role.
1278732	1279132	And eat.
1279572	1284776	Directed by Marcus Nispel, who did the recent remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
1284816	1287057	I'm thinking maybe being pregnant will help her look better.
1287558	1288899	You know, less anorexic.
1288999	1291360	They really need to put Natalie Portman in this.
1291380	1293642	The first rumors I heard were that Natalie Portman would be in it.
1293742	1295303	And right now, after seeing... She would be better.
1295423	1297484	After seeing closer, Natalie Portman should just be in everything.
1299266	1299586	I think.
1299846	1300727	Natalie Portman's hot.
1300847	1303949	And she could at least be more gothy than...
1305491	1307012	And she's also highly intelligent.
1307052	1308073	Did she graduate Harvard?
1308133	1310274	But Sarah Michelle Gellar was Buffy, you guys.
1311354	1314196	Oh, well, in that case, let me just stop all the press.
1314216	1316397	Let's put her in every movie because, you know, she was Buffy.
1316417	1318058	No, no, no, no.
1318699	1320500	When she was on Buffy, she looked healthy.
1321400	1324902	I cannot stand seeing Sarah Michelle Gellar the way she looks now.
1325562	1331186	Except that I'm hoping being pregnant will encourage her to eat food and not look like a starved little crow.
1332006	1332967	Thank you for watching!
1350513	1352334	How to Deliver a Baby
1378049	1379510	Like in the postage mail?
1379810	1380931	Like if you're at Walmart.
1381791	1384673	Hey, my water broke!
1384693	1386053	That was Natalie Portman roll.
1386173	1386654	Remember that?
1387674	1388575	Sadly enough, it was.
1390076	1390776	Number one.
1391468	1392889	Time the uterine contractions.
1393530	1404538	For first-time mothers, when contractions are about 3-5 minutes apart and last 40-90 seconds, an increase in strength and frequency for at least an hour, the labor is most likely real and not false.
1404738	1410083	I just want to point out, all you 13-21 year old guys, which is the primary demographic listening to this show...
1410863	1411744	Keep that in mind.
1412244	1413705	Time your uterine contraction.
1413865	1415186	It's not trying to eat you.
1415366	1416446	Dear, shut up.
1417567	1421489	Have clean, dry towels, a clean shirt, or something similar on hand.
1422450	1423030	Number two.
1423751	1429754	As the baby moves out of the womb, its head, the biggest part of its body, will open the cervix so the rest of it can pass through.
1430775	1431075	Three.
1431875	1434577	When the baby is out of the mother, dry it off and keep it warm.
1435083	1437064	God, I'm having flashbacks to the Miracle of Life.
1437144	1437484	Shut up!
1437504	1437944	Shut up!
1439404	1442565	If necessary, clear any fluid out of the baby's mouth with your fingers.
1443746	1445746	Four, tie off the umbilical cord.
1446046	1450768	Take a piece of string, a shoelace works as well, and tie off the cord several inches from the baby.
1450848	1452308	Do not cut the umbilical cord.
1452708	1454309	Number five, get to a hospital.
1454889	1457230	But my ultimate piece of advice in regards to that?
1457330	1457550	Yes.
1458430	1460531	Freaking have your midwife follow you everywhere you go.
1461547	1462468	and don't go to Walmart.
1462628	1468132	Number six, get it to the black market ASAP because the value of babies goes down dramatically.
1469333	1469893	Just stop.
1469913	1473936	You're a horrible, horrible person.
1474116	1474636	Moving on.
1474776	1477618	Actually, I was going around passing this around to all my coworkers at work.
1477638	1478819	It was great.
1478879	1479700	Half of them were pregnant.
1480480	1484804	Let's continue on with the baby theme, but this is kind of a, this is just sick.
1485124	1508343	I really don't know how else to explain this, but this is one of those things that's going around on email, which kind of makes me question if it's even legit or not, but you know, it's running on a lot of the big gaming websites, so I'm thinking it's got to be legit, but in Korea, there's stories announced out there that there was a mother and father who went to an internet cafe, and they were playing World of Warcraft.
1509023	1516527	and when they returned home, they found their four-month-old daughter dead, basically, because they left the daughter alone.
1518227	1520668	Of course, the couple has been booked on criminal charges.
1521089	1529653	The couple's defense, by the way, we were thinking of playing for just an hour or two and returning home like usual, but the game took longer that day.
1530753	1531974	So they've done this before.
1533534	1535475	The infant was the couple's only child.
1536096	1536856	Thank God!
1537921	1539802	They just shot themselves in the ass for that.
1539822	1543264	They deserve it.
1544444	1545865	But no baby deserves it.
1545885	1546446	The baby doesn't.
1546466	1548587	The baby doesn't deserve it, but the parents sure as hell do.
1550328	1553849	They were like, I'd give my firstborn to make level 57 tonight.
1553869	1556891	Oopsie.
1556911	1562274	You can address those cards and letters to Loki at OrangeHunter.com.
1565413	1566694	I don't know.
1566814	1571037	Sadly enough, the story doesn't surprise me because there's idiots in the world.
1571497	1576961	In Korea, in the United States, in Bolivia, everywhere.
1577722	1580644	There needs to be a standardized test before they let you breed.
1580864	1585508	If that was in the United States, it'd be the baby was dead in the car because the windows rolled up.
1586328	1587169	Along with their dog.
1590737	1592518	No comment from Blizzard on that, by the way.
1593479	1594600	Well, it's not Blizzard's fault.
1595020	1595660	It's not their fault.
1595740	1596401	It's not their fault.
1596641	1601264	You can bet somebody there will be a parents' council out there in the world somewhere.
1601344	1605447	I'm going to say that World of Warcraft causes babies to die.
1605647	1614013	Tell me there won't be this parents' council for freedom of America, whatever, somewhere that will say, World of Warcraft kills babies.
1614073	1615954	I almost said World of Warcraft.
1617999	1620581	I honestly, I haven't spent serious time with World of Warcraft.
1620601	1623722	I can't judge it one way or the other, but Final Fantasy XI won't kill your babies.
1624383	1626023	It probably did kill some of these dogs somewhere.
1626043	1628885	PSO won't kill your babies, because you can play in windowed mode.
1628905	1635769	Tell me there will not be somebody, some parent's council will say, World of Warcraft kills babies and should be taken off store shelves.
1635829	1636769	It's poisoning our youth.
1638150	1638930	Dot, dot, dot.
1640171	1643453	I'm surprised people that, you know, never mind.
1644363	1645163	I'm not going to go there.
1645183	1645884	Yeah, good idea.
1646004	1647765	How many babies died on EverQuest?
1647825	1649505	Let's talk about something a little happier.
1649525	1650986	No one that plays EverQuest can have babies.
1651166	1653527	Let's talk about Neopets.
1654648	1654768	Ah!
1655148	1655808	Mine are dead.
1655888	1657469	Everybody loves Neopets, right?
1657549	1658989	I checked on mine and they're dead.
1659230	1660530	Do your Neopets die now?
1660890	1662071	I couldn't get to my pets.
1662331	1664872	I had a Neopet like five years ago, I think.
1664992	1667113	And now Iguana Girl has your Neopet.
1667293	1669654	She adopted my Neopet years ago.
1670254	1671315	You had a Neopet once, right?
1671335	1672075	I had four Neopets.
1673036	1673656	They're all dead.
1674941	1675362	What did you do?
1675382	1677364	Did you leave him alone while you went to play World of Warcraft?
1677884	1678345	Ah, no.
1678485	1681868	I just got bored with him because I couldn't access it from work anymore.
1681968	1684811	Is it just me or did Neopets slowly go downhill over the years?
1684891	1689215	Neopets went downhill since they got a video game and a collectible card game.
1689355	1693219	And then, you know, I remember walking by Claire's one day.
1693239	1697103	I didn't go in there, but I walked by it one day and they were selling Neopets stuff and I'm just like...
1698144	1699405	I'm glad I stopped playing it.
1699425	1700146	Is it limited to?
1700366	1701647	They're all the same to me.
1701687	1702708	One of those girly stores.
1702728	1704209	Stupid Spoiled Whores, whatever those stores are.
1704229	1705250	Do you remember Pogs?
1706832	1707913	Do you remember Neopets?
1708153	1708453	No.
1710134	1712176	Pogs and Neopets are in the same family.
1712416	1712837	Here it is.
1712957	1718502	Neopets may not be as far away as you think because MTV bought Neopets.
1718522	1718842	That's right.
1718982	1724567	MTV Networks, home of music television, bought Neopets.
1725540	1728381	So that means that Neopets are going to start sucking even more.
1729761	1731902	Or it will be something else.
1731982	1735843	Maybe they can bring a Neopets show to MTV so they can continue to not play music.
1737864	1738344	Just a thought.
1738364	1739804	I already hate MTV.
1742585	1743906	Do you want to get into why?
1744386	1747947	Except that they gave me really neat Gorillaz commercials, but apart from that...
1749172	1749752	We love you, Adam Curry!
1749772	1750532	We love you, Adam Curry!
1774670	1775651	Tell us how you really feel.
1776431	1782795	Okay, even more than being a big festering pile of dog poopy, they don't play music anymore, and the music they do play sucks.
1783335	1786417	Unless it's Gorillas or Blur, or Super Furry Animals.
1786437	1787798	They don't play Blur anymore.
1787818	1788239	They used to.
1788659	1789659	Well, not here in America.
1789920	1790880	Like, one song.
1791120	1792301	Anyway, moving on, moving on.
1792621	1794362	Another network, Kids WB.
1795363	1803008	Kids WB will be getting 26 episodes of Beautiful Joe, which will be coming onto the network in the fall.
1803826	1806208	Two new Vitaful Gojo games are on their way out, by the way.
1806268	1810031	So, honestly, does this surprise anyone that it's being made into a cartoon?
1810051	1813014	Not really.
1813134	1816196	I don't stay up on the animes, so correct me.
1816277	1817137	It is an anime.
1817257	1818639	It has been out for some time.
1819219	1822362	I downloaded the first couple episodes of this, like, last year.
1823483	1824964	And it's on crack.
1825624	1828307	And Kids WB is going to butcher it!
1828847	1830729	And it will no longer retain its coolness!
1831533	1833995	Now, now, now, Kids WB didn't butcher Pokemon.
1834315	1835636	Yeah, they did.
1835956	1836457	Yeah, they did.
1836637	1837397	Yeah, they did.
1837637	1838498	Oh, right, that's right.
1839078	1840079	Pokemon was always a butcher, though.
1840099	1844682	I used to watch it in Japanese, and then you didn't see what they did to Digimon.
1844702	1848285	I know, I can't believe Kids WB took out all the strobing that was in that show.
1848685	1850326	And they took out the boob scene.
1850887	1855190	It's the part where Kojiro, what was he in Digimon?
1856018	1859599	James, and I'm so ashamed I know that Are there any TV networks you do like?
1879916	1880696	I like sci-fi.
1880937	1881717	They play Stargate.
1882678	1884780	And the Food Network for Iron Chef.
1885141	1889385	And I like Court TV and the History Channel and Biography.
1890005	1890626	Okay, sorry.
1890746	1892508	I don't have a news story on any of those channels.
1892528	1895510	But I do have a news story about G4, Television for Gamers.
1895771	1896371	Yay!
1897112	1898193	We like G4.
1898553	1901556	G4ia has their nominees coming out for...
1903057	1908520	G4 has their nominees coming out for G4ia, which is going to be taking place live August... No, I'm sorry.
1908560	1911121	It's July 27th, but will be shown on August 9th.
1911561	1912561	So it's not really live.
1912601	1914102	It's one of those tape delay things, but whatever.
1915022	1916523	They're doing things a little differently this year.
1916963	1919344	Industry experts select the nominees.
1919905	1921505	The gamers get to vote on them.
1921545	1923526	I guess it's probably through their website or something.
1923626	1926448	So we get more... What was it?
1927208	1927388	Hmm.
1929002	1934946	Best Innovation, Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, Field of Magic XYXX, Katamari Damacy, Full Spectrum Warrior, and PsyOps The Mindgate Conspiracy
1955107	1956128	I like this.
1956148	1957049	PsyOps is a good game.
1957129	1961453	Why would Field of Magic get a nomination because it's a ripoff of WarioWare?
1961533	1962473	And Luminous doesn't?
1962634	1964715	I don't know.
1965035	1972742	Best Original Soundtrack, Katamari Damacy, Fable, World of Warcraft, Halo 2, God of War.
1973242	1976305	Now, granted, all those games actually had really good soundtracks.
1976345	1978467	I can't argue with that, especially Katamari Damacy.
1979007	1979708	Especially that one.
1979728	1979988	Dude.
1981029	1983950	For the types of games they were, I actually really enjoyed Fable's soundtrack as well.
1984131	1986912	There's another category for licensed soundtrack, which Luminous was in.
1986932	1987952	Halo's gonna win, you know.
1988172	1988332	Huh?
1988532	1990893	Halo's gonna win because everyone votes Halo no matter what.
1990913	1993014	They could be like, best breakfast cereal.
1993114	1996716	Halo can be a nominee up against Fruit Loops or something like that.
1996976	1997376	Halo.
1997776	1998437	That's not cereal.
1998617	2001118	Right in the Nintendo breakfast system.
2002078	2003379	Best original game.
2003479	2008801	PsyOps, The Mindgate Conspiracy, Full Spectrum Warrior, God of War, Katamari Damacy, and Psychonauts.
2010044	2013266	God of War, or Katamari Damashii.
2013306	2024076	Here it is, Game of the Year, Half-Life 2, Halo 2, World of Warcraft, God of War, Resident Evil 4, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
2025497	2026798	Katamari Damashii should be in there.
2029520	2031762	I disagree with the entire list.
2032503	2036106	The production values for God of War, you can't really top that.
2036126	2036727	Considering
2037467	2040529	The audience in mind and the gaming public as a general.
2040549	2041909	We play a certain niche of games.
2041969	2047552	Taking the gaming public as a general, I guess, this list doesn't surprise me at all.
2047752	2050133	This honestly seems like a fair representation.
2050153	2051094	Are these all experts?
2051294	2053975	We're like the lunchtime poll in Heathers.
2055616	2060158	If the world was going to explode tomorrow and you had $6 million today, what would you do with it?
2060778	2062521	I'd go buy me Halo 2.
2063161	2070931	I would have liked to have seen a niche title, a black horse candidate, if you will, like Katamari Damacy or Luminous or something.
2072052	2073174	But it didn't happen.
2073514	2073975	What can you say?
2075171	2076552	So check that out if you want to.
2076632	2077592	It's over on G4.
2078893	2080913	Guitar Hero, that's the new game coming out.
2082074	2083895	Harmonix is teaming up with Red Octane.
2083975	2086936	It looks like a cross between Karaoke Revolution and Guitar Freaks.
2086976	2088477	Some songs have been announced.
2089057	2092538	And you know how they kind of did cover songs in Karaoke Revolution?
2092558	2093979	Well, it's going to be the same deal.
2093999	2095880	They're going to do cover songs in Guitar Hero.
2096220	2098761	But the covers in Karaoke Revolution weren't bad.
2098981	2100022	I've definitely heard worse.
2100122	2100642	They weren't bad.
2101147	2103128	So this should be interesting, the Guitar Hero.
2103168	2104349	Here's some of the songs that are going to be in it.
2104689	2124023	Red Hot Chili Peppers with Higher Ground, Boston, More Than a Feelin', Mega Death, Symphony of Destruction, Donna's Take It Off, Jimi Hendrix, Spanish Castle Magic, ZZ Top, Sharp Dressed Man, Black Sabbath, Iron Man, White Zombie, Thundercat 65, Queen of the Stone Age, No One Knows, David Bowie, Ziggy Stardust,
2124723	2132927	The Ramones, I Want To Be Sedated, Franz Ferdinand, Take Me Out, Deep Purple, Smoke On The Water, Cream, Crossroads, Sum 41, Fat Lip.
2133047	2134848	You had me at David Bowie.
2135548	2136608	I love Ziggy Stardust.
2137049	2144112	I kind of like the direction they're going with this because it got a lot of classic guitar blended with the newer bands that are known for guitars.
2144132	2148934	It's just the style of play that makes me think of that Johnny Whatever on the Gizmondo.
2149074	2149514	A little bit.
2149754	2152936	You know what I love, and they should have put it in there, is aerodynamical.
2153709	2154689	Well, this is just partial.
2154910	2155350	It's just partial.
2155370	2155890	Daft Punk.
2156190	2158191	That has one hell of a guitar solo in it.
2158571	2158931	We'll see.
2159991	2162412	Somebody brought this up a little earlier in the show, but I just want to clarify.
2162452	2168335	The revolution, the Nintendo revolution, there was a report over on Joystick.com.
2168375	2174777	That's with a Q. Joystick.com is reporting that they will be getting a graphical upgrade.
2174877	2175418	Remember how...
2177912	2185959	They announced months ago that Nintendo and Super Nintendo titles all the way up through 64 titles will be downloadable through the revolution.
2186139	2187801	They're going to get a graphical upgrade of some sort.
2188615	2189456	Kid Icarus, The Sotelo View
2208586	2217330	which was, we didn't get it over here, but it was like a download system where you could, you could actually download the ROMs for it now, the upgraded Zelda for Satellaview.
2218431	2221933	There were a bunch of different games, but they were all downloadable.
2221973	2223673	You could play them for a time limit and then.
2224274	2224954	Okay, okay.
2225655	2237024	Now, I can't see them going back and re-skinning all their old games, so I don't think it's that, although maybe for some of them it will be, because, like we were saying earlier in the show, why would you pay to download this stuff when you can emulate it for free?
2237044	2238385	Well, maybe that's a big incentive.
2239265	2244089	To play Kid Icarus with really nice Super Nintendo or even better graphics, I'd pay for that.
2244129	2245590	I really would.
2245710	2248092	I just want a freaking sequel to that game, that's all.
2248593	2249413	Is that too much to ask?
2250914	2254017	I had to be asked what the code was for Kid Icarus, by the way.
2255194	2257356	Icarus Fights Medusa Angels Terror Danger Horror!
2274707	2274907	GamePal
2292146	2297487	and Game Pal, what it does is it allows you to rent a character in an online world.
2297507	2300868	So I think it might be a play on the term Game Fly because you know how that's a rental service.
2301168	2320952	Well, Game Pal, for just a $300 deposit and for $150 for the first month and $130 for each month after that, you can have your choice of up to 50 accounts, one of 50 accounts for 14 popular MMOs, Star Wars Galaxies, Ultima Online, EverQuest, City of Heroes,
2322068	2325151	But the trick is, is that when you're renting these characters, you're renting God characters.
2325171	2326953	You're renting the highest they go.
2327053	2329856	So, you know, maximum level, all the good gear.
2330636	2331237	What do you think?
2332912	2335333	Is this a practical idea or is it a big joke?
2335653	2336434	Pisses me off.
2336494	2344577	Like, for example, on Ragnarok, I put in, what, two and a half years into my character to get her to level 70-something.
2345318	2349479	And then it would just piss me off to see someone come in with a level 100 character right off the bat.
2349860	2350580	It's ridiculous.
2350700	2353081	That's interesting because they're renting these characters, not selling them.
2353101	2353661	They're renting them.
2353681	2354822	They should charge even more.
2354942	2356342	The prices are a little weird.
2356382	2358183	They should jack those prices even more.
2358243	2359644	Make them pay for that privilege.
2360003	2362644	Loki, I know you've openly admitted to you don't care.
2363264	2364185	Buy your money online.
2364205	2364445	Who cares?
2364465	2365205	I think it's stupid.
2365305	2366866	Who would pay that kind of money for that?
2367186	2367766	An idiot would.
2368206	2375869	Honestly, for that kind of money, you could be buying a lot of online currency and get your character maxed out anyways.
2376109	2378331	For that money, you could actually buy groceries for two weeks.
2391184	2392946	You can use that as a car payment.
2393626	2396429	Get a babysitter for your baby when you go out to play World of Warcraft.
2396769	2401573	You know, goddammit people, live in the real fucking world, okay?
2402134	2410562	Games are fine every now and again, but keep in mind that your money, you know, you should use it responsibly or else you're going to end up like one of those losers whose baby died.
2411663	2413824	You'll be a loser, not a winner.
2414885	2416487	But that doesn't mean that you shouldn't play your games at all.
2417239	2419161	Another World of Warcraft story I have for you guys.
2419642	2420943	They're getting an expansion pack.
2421323	2422785	And that's pretty much all I have to say.
2422825	2424307	There's really not a whole lot of news besides that.
2424327	2426249	They announced that they're making an expansion pack.
2427090	2429332	That's kind of the duh news of the week, you know.
2429652	2429732	Wow.
2429752	2430533	Let's see.
2430673	2431915	Over 2 million people.
2432435	2433376	You're a dork.
2433857	2436239	Over 2 million people on this MMO.
2436339	2438001	You think we might do an expansion or 12?
2438041	2438121	Yeah.
2439900	2464942	I'll stick with PSO, thank you, until Ragnarok 2 comes out I'm still curious about WoW I'm taking a break from MMOs in general right now I'm kind of burnt on them, but I think when I come back I will check out WoW I still think you should play PSO with me I'm on a break I will pay for you a month to play PSO with me We'll see I can't say anything against free stuff, we'll see Alright, one last story for you guys tonight You know Happy Tree Friends?
2466874	2475737	Yeah, these were the shorts they used to show at Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted where they had these cute lovable furry animals and they kill each other senseless.
2475777	2477738	They gouge out eyeballs and all this stuff.
2478498	2483080	So what more would be perfect for Happy Tree friends than for them to get their own video game?
2483920	2484481	It's happening.
2485821	2491025	Brad Young, chief executive of Flashman Studios, says it's an almost perfect brand for video games.
2491445	2502914	The simple, cute, and hugely appealing graphical style combined with a very dark, clever humor and the cartoon violence provides a wonderful opportunity for the video games market to tap into a huge global fan base.
2504375	2507017	Might I add, I hope this turns out better than Clay Fighters.
2507937	2508858	I liked Clay Fighters.
2508938	2510059	It was all about Helga.
2510905	2515529	I thought Clay Fighters was... It was one of those one-trick games.
2515930	2518552	No, it was all about... Who was this Mr. Frosty?
2520454	2521875	Dude, I love Clay Fighters.
2522236	2523937	How could you put down Clay Fighters?
2523957	2526940	I didn't like Clay Fighters because I had Street Fighter 2, which was much better.
2526960	2528381	So did I, and I had Clay Fighters.
2528662	2529302	It was all about C2.
2531198	2536462	Loki, you're awfully quiet, but you were the first one to show me a DVD full of these things.
2536662	2538903	I actually cringed at some of these cartoons.
2538943	2541565	It takes a lot to gross me out, but some of these are nasty.
2542105	2546208	It's just building off the popularity of Conker, Live and Reloaded.
2548103	2551604	I seem to recall that G4 was running these in some capacity too.
2551624	2560466	Yeah, they're running them on their Attack of the Show show that's on their network, and it's kind of like, ooh, look at us, we're hip and, yeah.
2560486	2564788	Well, they do, like, they show, like, popular clips on the web, and it doesn't surprise me so much.
2564948	2565588	It's just, you know.
2565648	2566068	Interesting.
2567001	2590286	Let's jump on board this now, you know, what, you know, how many years All aboard the sellout train, woo woo, you know we'd hop on it too, we would hop on it too How late are they, well, while we're at it, let's get a Strong Bad game, you know, hey, that'd be fun Hey, no, that would be fun I am surprised that hasn't happened already Imagine if you had, like, the whole Strong Bad RPG Hey, what do you think's the first website that's gonna become a movie?
2593827	2595488	First website to become a movie?
2595569	2596669	Yeah, first website.
2596689	2598371	Just as long as it's not Tub Girl or Goat Day.
2598411	2600032	What if it's DarkSakura.com?
2600933	2602875	Which is like not updated every year?
2603855	2604136	Nah.
2604356	2604596	What?
2605096	2607438	Oh, I thought you actually had an answer.
2607458	2608439	No, I didn't have an answer.
2608459	2610061	I was just throwing out a question.
2610221	2617587	Actually, funny enough, I looked up DarkSakura in Google Images to see what I could find, and the third picture was Shermie, my cat.
2618370	2619531	DarkSakura, all one word under Google Image Search
2647709	2652245	And so I was sitting there, you know, playing my game and all of a sudden I feel the ground under me roll.
2652305	2654212	I'm like, damn, this is a realistic game.
2655237	2657279	The first earthquake I ever felt, though, was in Alabama.
2679611	2680391	A tremor off the coast.
2680411	2681632	Not a state known for their earthquakes.
2681732	2682893	It was a tremor off the coast.
2682913	2683293	All right.
2683513	2684734	Your final thought, DarkSakura?
2685114	2685794	My final thought?
2686195	2687415	Reject false icons.
2689076	2689757	Because I said so.
2690797	2694399	And my final thought is I want candy, so I'm going to go get it right now.
2694419	2695220	I want candy.
2695320	2695540	I am.
2696080	2697181	Thank you guys very much.
2697481	2698381	Have a great week.
2698401	2701203	We'll see you next time on the Orange Lounge Radio to-go edition.
2702927	2706512	That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.
