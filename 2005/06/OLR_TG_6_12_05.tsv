379	3421	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of June 13th, 2005.
3741	14367	You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
14647	18169	Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
20530	26893	Hello, everybody out there on the internet who has subscribed to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition.
26933	28094	We appreciate that.
28594	29715	Thanks a bunch for tuning in.
30635	31036	DarkSakura
57987	60068	I have a new car!
61169	62909	And I'm moving out of my hellhole apartment.
63950	64930	In a couple weeks.
65331	66191	Before the end of the month.
66211	68252	My birthday's coming up, what are you getting me?
75934	76955	and I'll see you next time.
99266	102048	I think they must be ranked in the top ten over on the alley, I don't know.
102788	106210	Anyway, my name is Rob Roberts, of course, also known as Sky.
106310	113674	We're here to talk about games, and we're going to start off tonight's edition as we always do, talking about the games that we've been playing this week.
113714	114555	DarkSakura, how about you?
115855	119637	Um, Phantasy Star Online, Blue Burst.
119818	120938	The beta's over, right?
121138	127302	Yes, actually, the beta will be over as of tomorrow, so it goes pay-to-play, and I will be...
128294	130335	Registrating my account and canceling my Xbox One.
131395	133176	I will probably be canceling the Xbox One, too.
133216	136458	I'm considering starting it on the PC, but I'm kind of on the fence.
136838	141480	I had a lot of fun with the beta, but I just feel like, do I really want to commit to this MMO?
141740	142360	I kind of do.
142441	143141	One of us!
143361	144742	One of us!
145202	152865	I wish more folks would be taking that Guild Wars model, where just gouge me for 50 bucks when I buy the game, then don't charge me to pay per month anymore.
152965	154106	But I guess...
155398	160081	I think Guild Wars has been doing very successful for that reason, but I guess other companies don't want to follow suit.
160181	160541	I don't know.
162362	164243	I've also been watching Dan play a lot of Fire Emblem.
164663	166484	Lots of Fire Emblem.
166544	167645	Which one?
169826	178091	It's hard for me to think of the second release in the States as the second one because it's technically the third one on the Game Boy Advance.
180132	183976	The first one was the one that Marth and Roy were from, even if you ever played Smash Bros.
184056	184936	Oh yeah, I know Marth and Roy.
184956	186017	But we never got that game.
186638	190922	Well, Dan found a ROM of it, and I found him an English patch for it.
191482	198088	So he's been quite happy playing through that and getting his Fire Emblem on, and I like seeing how the games all connect.
198188	199830	And honestly, I'm thinking about starting to play it.
199930	202292	I hate turn-based strategy, but I would play this.
203359	205121	Fire Emblem is a game I never really got into.
205181	206502	I just need to give it a second look, I think.
207042	208063	I don't know why.
208243	214449	One of the rarest games I own is the Macross strategy game on the TurboGrafx, the PC Engine Duo.
215369	216370	And I hate that game.
216530	216851	I hate it.
216931	218252	I just have it because it's hard to get.
218932	219393	Seriously.
219633	220834	Well, you have Night Trap, right?
220854	221635	And that game sucks.
221915	223776	Well, yeah, but Night Trap you can find anywhere.
224591	225532	Oh, I thought that was a rare one.
226032	227493	Uh, you find it.
227974	229435	They say it's rare and blah blah blah.
229675	230876	I'm not much of a collector.
230916	234078	It has what's-her-face from different strokes.
234879	235279	She died.
235520	236120	Yeah.
236180	236981	She killed herself, did she?
237001	237581	I don't know.
237601	237841	No, she OD'd.
237861	239042	I don't know, it was years ago.
239062	240504	After being in Night Trap.
241344	242365	Shut up.
242405	242885	Be nice.
243146	243486	Be nice.
243526	245928	Remember, down the block, not across the street.
247589	249691	If I were in Night Trap, I would do it.
250311	252193	If I were desperate enough to be in Night Trap.
253294	253494	Wow.
254611	255172	Okay, not really.
255192	257633	I'd be like, okay, I have money.
257653	259515	It's better than porn.
259835	261537	Y'all are stupid for the stupid game.
261557	261957	Could be worse.
261977	262437	Could be boring.
262798	267721	Anything else you've been playing?
267862	270063	Only the games on the Gorillas webpage.
271024	275888	I've been playing with the darts at the toilet.
278410	278750	You know what?
278790	280071	We'll come back to web games in a minute.
280131	282153	Loki, what have you been playing this week?
282498	287920	I played a little bit, very briefly, of Tetris Worlds for the Game Boy Advance.
288700	295223	And it's Tetris in eight different forms, or seven different forms, all of which are just too damn similar.
295623	296823	So Tetris is Tetris.
297263	298784	And then I played WarioWare Twisted.
298864	301045	Actually, I played WarioWare Twisted about five minutes ago.
301165	309167	So it's fun, and it has a bunch of weird, stupid minigames in it that are just fun and just strange.
309207	310568	Like, you can grade cake.
311570	312911	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
333891	336354	What do you think of this game compared to WarioWare Touched?
336635	337716	I haven't played WarioWare Touched.
337736	338357	Oh, I thought you had.
338417	339218	I need to pick it up, though.
339759	341802	I thought about picking it up, and I need to go do that.
341882	348130	You know, most people I've talked to that have played all the games say that Twisted is the best, Touched is the worst, with the
348729	349710	WarioWare Twisted is a very short game.
376897	377377	Every time.
377597	381019	So I can keep playing the same stage over and over, and I can just get unlocks that way.
381439	382100	That's cool.
382500	391624	But, yeah, the thing is, though, is because Nellie was playing some of the older stages, so she was unlocking games that I didn't have before, so I go and play my game, all of a sudden there's these games, and I'm like, what the hell do I have to do here?
391644	393225	It was funny.
394365	394966	A lot of fun, though.
395226	395606	Anything else?
397187	398768	Final Fantasy XI, a little bit.
398788	399708	I got to play that.
400368	405491	I still wish they'd fixed their server problem, whatever it is, because it, like...
405990	407171	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
433888	437431	and it couldn't load anything, so I just backed out of it.
437851	448280	But I don't know what the problem is, and I know that it stopped me from playing a few times, and it's always around the same time, usually around 11pm-ish around there is when it stops.
448580	456967	Which is great, because right before that happened, Nelly was bitching at me about... Nelly, my fianc√©, was bitching at me how I was playing... Not the rapper.
457308	457968	No, not the rapper.
458449	459710	She was saying how...
461198	469143	I was playing this stupid game and stuff and how I should, you know, come pay attention to her or something and then the game, you know, started crashing on me.
469183	471645	I'm like, are you sure she just didn't pull the plug?
472065	476027	Oh, I'm positive because my cable modem, my cable modem is right on my desk.
476047	476828	It's a DOF attack.
476948	478068	Denial of fiance.
478789	479309	No, no, no.
479409	483312	No, this, the game, she didn't, she was just being cranky.
483632	487354	I mean, she's just like, typical, never mind.
487574	488915	Yeah, seriously, typical.
488955	489516	I have a spirit.
489536	489836	Okay.
490516	494457	Typical woman, she's like, I didn't say it, I didn't say it.
494557	496418	Okay, this shit doesn't happen in my house.
496918	499058	I don't want to go outside, but I don't want to stay inside.
499619	501379	Well, there's no in between.
501419	503440	You can't not go outside, not stay inside.
503460	504520	Tell her to go sit in the doorway.
504860	505340	Patio.
507321	509481	This shit does not happen in my house.
509881	514483	It's like, get your ass off the PS2, because I want to play fucking Silent Hill.
515723	516823	Yeah, it's never that.
516923	518484	I mean, it's just like, that'd be stupid.
518504	519484	Tell her to take up smoking.
520239	522457	She's been doing cross stitch, so, you know...
523382	524263	More power to her.
525003	525343	Alright.
526124	526745	My Gaming Week.
526785	529467	I also checked out WarioWare Twisted for a little bit.
529747	531548	Just because I had to play the Kid Icarus stage.
531748	532008	Okay?
532629	534931	Because, damn, that's a game they need to bring back.
535271	535631	Why?
535971	536992	It's been how many years?
537232	538473	Why have they not brought that game back?
538593	539554	I'm so upset.
539854	544578	But they tease us in WarioWare Twisted with a level inspired by Kid Icarus.
544598	545658	They have the boss battle.
545839	550162	The boss battle for the retro games is you're playing Super Mario Bros.
550662	551363	But it's like...
552003	553104	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
568841	573642	None of the unlocks were really that great, but I'm kind of impressed with some of the things I'm seeing in Twisted so far.
573982	575763	I like that they have a lot more of the minigames.
575823	578043	I played the Apple Shooter or whatever that thing was.
578123	578844	That's a lot of fun.
578864	579464	That was kind of funny.
579484	579844	I like that.
580004	585405	And also, like, they have the Sheep County one that's pretty hard, because they... Oh, man, it pissed me off yesterday.
585465	586466	I was, like, getting really far in it.
586486	590347	All of a sudden, the sheep stop, and then they run really fast, and they run into the wall, and then you're fucked.
590687	595028	Because, you know... And then they have, like, another one that's ski jumping that's pretty fun, and then...
596448	598790	Space Boomerang, which is just strange.
598870	599110	Wow.
599470	599770	Crazy.
601891	604673	I have to play this if you get to murder sheep.
606253	607314	It's like in Lemmings, right?
607914	609515	Well, you don't get to murder sheep.
609535	611056	You're not trying to murder sheep.
611136	614358	It's just that they smash into the wall and then you get a sheep pile.
615198	617039	That just reminds me of a commercial.
617119	619140	But you get to great cakes, DarkSakura.
619220	619821	And carrots.
620241	622482	This reminds me of a commercial that I saw today.
622902	641265	Dan went on the classic video game commercial website, and they had one for a football game, as in soccer, of this old man lecturing his dog on, you know, don't let the sheep make fun of you, go out and get them, and so the dog's herding him in here, crowd cheering like it's playing with a goal and everything, and he's herding the sheep.
642507	643287	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
660524	662265	And this is coming from a woman!
690501	691281	Smile and nod.
693082	695103	Learn the fine art of filtering.
697524	705988	When you start to hear the pitch rise just a little bit, say, you know, why don't we just take a moment and sit down and talk about this?
707528	712250	Can we get away from the women are from Venus and men are Mars chat for a minute?
712330	716532	Because I will totally admit that we're from the moon.
717518	719820	If by Venus you mean Crazy Town, then yeah.
719860	721021	Alright, stop, enough.
721401	725645	No, as a woman, I can vouch for this, we're nuts.
726706	728287	But so are men, because men are stupid.
728567	728787	Sorry.
730225	731346	I'm willing to live with that.
760628	763570	I can say without a doubt that I've never played any PopCap games ever.
763590	764451	Well, maybe you should.
764631	765611	I had Neopets.
766412	769094	Okay, well, that's laughable, so I feel better, yeah.
770254	773977	But I was very, very good at that bullshit game they had on there.
774867	781689	I don't know why, but I've just been all about playing Zuma and all the games that are on there.
782029	782729	And San Aquarium.
782869	783469	I love that game.
783669	784049	It's awesome.
784389	784629	Anyway.
786370	786630	I know.
786970	797452	I feel like I'm letting everybody down by admitting that I play PopCap games because they're the same games that the 50-something-year-old women I work with play on their breaks.
797592	798673	They're playing Bookworm.
798813	802774	Is that like Apple saying, you know, we're going to put Intel processors in our PCs now?
803594	804374	We're letting you down.
805881	806521	Oh well, alright.
807322	809904	Anyway, let's move on to some more gaming news.
809924	812786	We want to do a follow-up to a gaming story we were talking about a couple weeks ago.
813346	816169	The gaming actors, you might remember, they were threatening to go on strike.
816249	817790	This would have to do with the voice actors.
818170	828138	They did vote, and actually a majority voted to strike, but they needed to have a super majority in order to strike, two-thirds, and they did not achieve that.
828937	831418	Just no ordinary majority will do.
831438	833299	We need super majority.
834139	839901	So basically right now... Is that even a real concept or is that just saying, we don't really care what you think?
839921	840942	I don't know.
841002	842342	But anyway, this is the contract.
842422	843943	It's now going to be good through the end of 2008.
844863	850866	It will grant the voice actors an increase in pay up to 36% through the duration of the contract.
851186	852947	The first raise, which will be a 25% hike...
854307	855949	goes into effect July 1st.
855989	861953	If you're curious how much they make right now, the minimum rate for a four-hour voice acting session, $556.
862254	863715	So that's going up by 25%.
863995	865516	I'm going to be a voice actor now.
865857	869480	One thing that the voice actors didn't get was the residuals.
869500	876906	You might remember that this was a big thing they were pushing for was they want to get... If the game's successful, they want a chunk of the profits because the actors feel that they contribute to that.
877306	878847	So they wanted that.
878887	879688	They did not get that.
879708	880709	They only got the pay raise.
880809	882610	So, well, at least it's something, huh?
882731	882891	So...
883471	884994	Voices of Famous People in Your Games
894853	923739	and so therefore when they say all in favor of you know striking's AI you are a dumbass alright moving on to a follow up from another story we did a couple weeks ago actually it was a couple months ago at this point can you believe we've been doing this crap that long GameStop and EB you might remember it was announced they're gonna merge into this powerhouse gaming store but remember as we said to sum it up GameStop and EB were not each other's competition the real competition Walmart, Target
924019	925620	So now they're joining forces.
926120	929062	The merger was okayed by the federal government.
930023	931184	So it's a done deal.
931404	932024	It will happen.
932044	937408	So those of you guys that maybe work for one or the other that were a little bit nervous about teaming up with the enemy,
938203	939584	Sorry, it's a done deal now.
939604	941105	Dude, they're the same store already.
941165	947809	I mean, it's just like, you can literally put like a GameStop sign out from EB and it would look just like a GameStop.
947869	952592	Well, you know, one thing that you may not realize is that, and this is something I learned today, is that they advertise match.
952913	956155	So if EB's running an ad, GameStop will match that ad.
956195	960478	Now, granted, this would be, you know, some stores may not go for this, but most stores are going to do this.
960538	964400	Any, you know, store that wants to stay in business will do the ad matching.
964460	967042	So you can even take in an ad from EB Games to a GameStop and...
967867	969887	I remember when they used to use...
990467	992529	Engage Games going in the discount bin.
993530	995992	The Engage is gone from Dan's store.
996212	999374	I actually overheard a guy in one of the stores.
999394	1007321	I was at one of the other stores today, and I actually overheard a guy asking for help on the Engage tech support, and I just felt like walking by going, dude, just throw it away.
1007701	1008321	Stop wasting your time.
1008622	1010263	The taco of doom.
1010824	1019891	It was just sad walking through E3 and seeing what a big, beautiful setup they had, and all of five people there, including us as we were passing through it.
1022073	1026708	I was trying not to make any sudden movements in case any of the Engage Arena staff might see me.
1026989	1027170	You go...
1028055	1028735	Someone's interested!
1028915	1029195	Get him!
1030015	1031416	I thought someone was heading to me.
1031936	1037977	I'm like... Dude, it only took me... I swear to you, 30 seconds of playing Civilization on the N-Gage.
1038177	1045499	Because I just had... Civilization is one of my... Probably... No, I... And keep in mind, I was addicted to Final Fantasy XI for two and a half years.
1045799	1048260	Civilization, I was addicted to for a longer period.
1048620	1050420	And I absolutely love that game.
1050440	1051720	It's my favorite PC game of all time.
1051740	1054161	So I had to see what happened to it on the N-Gage.
1056608	1058430	30 seconds or less, there was a guy over.
1058450	1059271	Do you have any questions?
1060091	1060372	Yeah.
1060432	1062474	How do I do anything on this game?
1063354	1064756	I cannot figure anything out.
1065196	1066577	Why does it suck so bad?
1067058	1067398	I laughed.
1067839	1068539	You know what's weird, though?
1068559	1071242	This game is making my stomach lighting bleed.
1071802	1076827	Love Civilization 1, never got into Civ 2 or 3, even though most people consider Civ 2 as the peak of the series.
1077167	1078148	I never got into Civ 2 or 3.
1078448	1078829	Don't know why.
1078989	1079990	But I'm still curious about Civ 4.
1081983	1083163	Another follow-up story.
1083203	1084543	Lots and lots of follow-up stories tonight.
1084604	1091405	Nintendo, you might remember that there was this rumor going around about the revolution, where they're going to be doing the downloadable games.
1091945	1092985	That hasn't changed.
1093005	1096226	They're still going to be offering the retro games for download in the library.
1096286	1097226	No real specifics.
1097626	1106908	But what did happen is that in an interview in Famitsu Magazine, Nintendo president Satoru Iwata says, you guys are making up rumors out there.
1107208	1108608	We never said this was going to be free.
1109977	1111038	Some Might Be Free
1132489	1138991	You know, obviously it's not going to all be free because, you know, let's just not make any money from re-releasing our games 50 times like we do all the time.
1139531	1157496	You know, I kind of found it hard to believe, too, that when you are releasing these classic Nintendo games such as, you know, Metroid, even though you can unlock Metroid through two other Metroid games, either Metroid Zero Mission or the Metroid Prime Fusion link-up, they were charging $20 for this separately.
1157616	1160777	I kind of found it hard to believe that suddenly this game would be free on the Revolution.
1161617	1161777	So...
1163444	1163764	DarkSakura.com
1193874	1197598	Very interesting story out of China going on.
1199180	1207489	You might have heard about this online, but there was actually a fight that broke out between two individuals in China over a virtual sword.
1208390	1211053	And this one Chinese guy...
1212337	1214618	and I will horribly pronounce this, I apologize.
1214978	1225023	Kui Chengwei was the guy that attacked Zhu Kaoyan and murdered him, basically, over a dispute over an online sword.
1227144	1228344	And the parents are upset.
1229204	1233026	Kui received a suspended death sentence for this attack.
1234006	1234987	The virtual sword
1235888	1239170	was sold to another gamer for 7,200 yuan, and that's $600 United States money.
1239290	1240790	So a $600 sword got murdered over.
1240830	1241831	Sounds like a cracking club.
1257757	1258977	in Final Fantasy XI?
1259077	1261658	Would you murder someone over a Kraken Club, though?
1261698	1262458	That's insane.
1262858	1263338	Come on.
1263398	1264638	You gotta draw the line somewhere.
1264779	1265339	Exactly.
1265399	1270400	Kraken Club, that's just like, you know, knees broken, I mean, because that's not even worth that.
1270700	1275361	I mean, granted, this is a story out of China, but the sad thing is, I could see this happening here.
1276061	1277061	Does anyone want to doubt me?
1277861	1279862	I don't doubt it at all because people are stupid.
1280702	1285583	You know, people... Life... Allow me to get a little philosophical here.
1285603	1285823	Please.
1285843	1286103	Please.
1287509	1298334	You know, we live in a world where things are not the bright, beautiful sunshine that, you know, MTV and Teletubbies wants us to think it is.
1299115	1300996	You know, I love you!
1302256	1307719	But seriously, it's not all about pop star drama and reality TV.
1308219	1309660	That's an illusion.
1310560	1313842	And the thing is that people are looking, you know, people understand that
1314264	1320808	That we're really living in a pretty dark time right now with all the crap that's going on in the world.
1321728	1328412	And even their own lives are so mundane and maybe so unhappy that people are always looking for a form of escape.
1328912	1330233	That's why we watch TV.
1330613	1331813	That's why we listen to music.
1331833	1332994	That's why we're here.
1333174	1335695	Honestly, we're here to offer that to our listeners.
1336376	1338417	But it's the point where you start...
1339640	1346308	Wanting to escape it to the point where you are totally immersing yourself in fantasy.
1346828	1348510	That's the point that it's gone on too far.
1348570	1354357	When you start losing touch like that, that's when you start losing it in your head.
1355109	1374983	at least there is poetic justice in this world because Britney Spears Chaotic is one of the lowest rated shows on television so at least there is poetic justice in the world I didn't mean to be down on it but that's my whole theory on this whole epidemic of people immersing themselves in all these MMOs is the fact that basically life sucks
1375663	1376564	Let's have some fun.
1376604	1378365	So you see MMOs as an escape?
1378485	1381327	I see it as any form of entertainment.
1381387	1381887	I'll admit it.
1381907	1384989	To me, Final Fantasy XI, when I was so into it, was a bit of an escape.
1385009	1387210	But games in general are kind of an escape.
1387510	1389511	But I don't let it blur the line with the real world.
1389611	1391032	I realize it's fictional.
1391252	1393214	But unfortunately, not everybody has that brain capacity.
1393234	1394354	But Vanadil doesn't exist.
1394675	1394955	Shush.
1395675	1399259	And I think, though, that it's these people that get too far into it.
1399640	1407528	Or even, you know, get too far... I have to admit, I'm a pretty rabid, you know, Gorillaz fan, but not to the point where I can't distinguish between reality and not.
1407548	1410732	Where you think you're going to marry Murdoch, considering he's a cartoon character.
1410952	1411092	No.
1411833	1411973	No.
1412634	1413074	No, no, no.
1413455	1413955	Right.
1414456	1415337	But I'm saying...
1416805	1418166	There's a limit to that.
1420728	1426652	Remember in the 80s, the screaming Michael Jackson fans and the woman who thought that she was his wife and had his baby.
1427993	1430175	And to this day, she still claims to be his wife.
1431156	1432477	That is losing yourself.
1433017	1435118	That is going to the point of going nutso.
1435699	1436920	And that's like the guy in China.
1437140	1440783	They were too far into their game to be able to distinguish it from reality.
1440843	1443264	And when you go that far, that's it.
1445266	1445546	All right.
1445964	1452649	If you have any feedback, comments, want to give a shout out to Jamie, or you want to maybe give her a question or whatever.
1452729	1454631	I look forward to seeing a counterpoint.
1455231	1457513	2go at orangeloungeradio.com.
1457753	1458694	2go at orangeloungeradio.com.
1458714	1463658	We actually added a new section of our website even over at orangeloungeradio.com that says contact staff.
1463738	1467101	So if you want to contact any of us, our emails are all right there, as well as the general address.
1467121	1469503	I would like to give a shout to the people I heard from last week.
1470263	1472125	To Jimmy, who...
1473106	1475809	Likes our podcast and Misty's back.
1476189	1476630	Right on.
1477490	1479452	And to Robin from PodNova.
1480173	1480614	Oh, cool.
1480654	1480934	Hi.
1481875	1483116	So, hi to all you guys.
1483136	1483616	Thanks for writing.
1484037	1486700	And I'd like to give a shout out to the people that have contacted me.
1487280	1493026	Thank you to VidRx for the wonderful blue pill ads.
1493086	1493807	I love those.
1494107	1495048	And thank you to...
1498166	1501347	HotSluts.com for sending me ads.
1501707	1507029	And also, I have enough free PSP offers, so no thanks for those.
1507709	1512431	By the way, the game in question, because I'm sure you guys are curious, what game was this?
1512691	1515472	It's the actual game called Legend of Myr 3.
1516092	1519493	So not something I've heard of here, but it must be more popular overseas.
1519553	1520974	I think I have heard of that one, actually.
1521614	1521954	Not me.
1522155	1522695	What can I say?
1523115	1523335	All right.
1523395	1539207	I think a good follow-up piece would be DarkSakura is on a roll here, so I think she needs to start dishing out her advice column here because, you know, we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we're not just here to talk about games all the time because if we talked about games all the time, we'd have no time to go sit in the doorway.
1539767	1545091	So we are here to better your life with the advice column because you need to go outside once in a while.
1545591	1547953	And who better than our one and only DarkSakura?
1547993	1550855	DarkSakura, what are you going to give the kids some advice about tonight?
1551636	1554777	Today's piece of advice is how to survive when lost in the jungle.
1554797	1556457	This is helpful.
1556598	1556858	Yes.
1557558	1558618	Number one, find water.
1559218	1567121	If you do not have the means to purify water, cut sections from large water vines or cut banana trees to capture the water welling out from the stalks.
1567621	1572122	Only drink water from streams and rivers as a last resort as this water will most likely give you diarrhea.
1574003	1576744	Number two, eat only foods that you can peel or cook.
1577224	1580305	Avoid brightly colored plants or plants with a milky sap.
1580325	1581325	Many of these are poisonous.
1582037	1586802	Insects, grubs, and raw fish, except those with bristles or spines rather than scales, are safe to eat.
1587222	1588363	Peel fruits before eating.
1588564	1590726	Peels may harbor diarrhea-causing bacteria.
1591647	1593669	But, my final piece of advice?
1593829	1594049	Yes.
1594930	1595711	Stay out of Brazil.
1597533	1599054	Unless... We might have listeners there.
1599114	1599455	Be nice.
1599515	1601717	Unless, of course, you can't go... I mean, in the jungle.
1602942	1603743	Don't go to the jungle.
1603863	1605965	Don't go to the jungle unless you can't, you know, go.
1606046	1607307	And watch out for dinosaurs.
1608328	1611111	And bring toilet paper because you might breathe and catch diarrhea.
1612813	1616555	Be sure not to slip on the diarrhea in the jungle.
1618016	1622598	That's more usages of the word diarrhea than we have allotted for this show.
1622798	1624899	Loki, did you have some stories you wanted to share with us tonight?
1624959	1628181	I know you're excited about this PSP hacking thing.
1630082	1638906	As it's been rumored all week, PSP, everyone's looking for a way to run homebrew applications on version 1.5 PSP.
1638926	1640247	For those not in the know,
1643228	1648753	The version 1.0 PSPs were the very first ones launched in Japan and all the US ones were version 1.5.
1649093	1657019	So all of us over here, unless you actually import a 1.0 version PSP, you can't run those cool emulators and all that stuff.
1657700	1666507	However, now there's this one website stating, yes, they found a way and they're going to launch it on...
1667614	1670196	June 15th on the 15th hour.
1670816	1673598	Oh, I get it.
1673618	1673598	1.5.
1675439	1685725	The website, only4.info, they have a video on there that's showing a version 1.5 PSP running.
1685765	1688267	The number 4, only 4, or only F-O-R?
1688407	1691109	It's only and then the number 4.
1691289	1692570	All one word, .info.
1694951	1701137	And they have a video, people are of course saying, oh it's fakes, and people are saying, oh it's real.
1702098	1705561	I guess you'll find out on Wednesday when this is actually launched.
1706202	1710726	And supposedly they have a tutorial on how to make programs to run in version 1.5.
1712225	1717446	And it only works in version 1.5 because whatever the hole is was fixed in version 1.51.
1718046	1724248	So hopefully you haven't upgraded your PSP to anything above 1.5 because otherwise you're screwed.
1725088	1734630	But this makes a lot of sense since also they have some brand new stuff for the PSP homebrew stuff.
1734710	1735470	Like for example...
1736517	1743522	X-MAME was released for the PSP, and that's MAME for your PSP, so you can play all your favorite arcade emulators.
1744143	1751408	And then also there's emulators now out for the Game Boy Color, for the Mega Drive.
1752669	1753950	for Neo Geo Pocket.
1754390	1755931	Just tons of stuff out there.
1757432	1763997	And hopefully this will happen and we'll see this being able to play these homebrew applications.
1764017	1770982	So when you go to this website on the 15th, either you're going to find the holy grail here of emulation on the PSP, or you're going to find your computer filled with spyware.
1771002	1772403	Because this would be a practical joke.
1772523	1773383	I don't know.
1773724	1774945	I think it sounds pretty legit.
1774985	1778407	It's going to be, it'll be everywhere on the net if this is the case because it's going to just
1779308	1780208	It's a big thing.
1781249	1783191	I'm sure you will bring us a full report.
1783391	1783771	Oh, yes.
1784412	1789456	And also, on the other portable end, we have DS.
1789916	1793319	We have Space Invaders for the DS, and they're actually playing that.
1794520	1800525	Now, I believe they're running on Linux, because they have Linux running for the DS right now.
1801186	1802607	When's it going to be installed on a toaster?
1803214	1805375	Did you hear this story from earlier this week?
1805415	1807056	And I don't have the article up in front of me.
1807076	1809037	For some reason, I forgot to pull it up for tonight's stuff.
1809098	1813520	But PlayStation 3, they're saying, will have Linux installed on it by default.
1814040	1818303	PlayStation 3, their hard drives will come with Linux installed on them because they're not being included.
1818683	1826828	But they said that you would be able to install other operating systems such as Windows and Tiger, which would be the Mac OS X.
1827595	1827895	and so on.
1843971	1845932	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1859918	1868660	Let's see here, we've got also details that the Nintendo DS outsells the Sony PSP and PlayStation 2 combined in Japan.
1869120	1874121	That's actually sold that well, and you can probably thank that to Nintendogs, because Nintendogs rocks.
1874261	1876022	And I think it's going to be a big thing here too.
1876202	1884264	Nintendogs actually has a little epidemic attached to it, sort of catching on the way Pokemon, you know, the little shaky ones...
1885044	1890670	You know, um, they're, you know, it's like I was talking to the guy at E3.
1891110	1894574	They'll be, the boys start playing Nintendogs to pick up girls.
1895455	1899319	Because the girls were all playing it and their little puppies would bark at them.
1899819	1901461	So the boys' doggies would bark back.
1901701	1902982	DarkSakura, what's going on in the UK?
1932101	1935403	National University of Singapore by a mixed reality lab.
1936244	1946189	And what they were doing, they're having it, they're using GPS, Bluetooth, virtual reality, Wi-Fi, infrared, and sensing mechanisms trying to create a virtual world.
1946209	1952633	So these people are wearing these hats, these goggles, and it's actually putting the dots in front of them and they're running the maze.
1953333	1958176	Now, it's pretty cool, you know, there's pictures in the
1958959	1961742	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1977320	1981582	That was just kids running in the street pretending to be ghosts and stuff.
1981782	1983403	I think I think that to you.
1984063	1984724	Maybe, yeah.
1984924	1988165	The virtual dots that project in front of you, that's kind of cool.
1988185	1989606	That's the new part of it.
1989666	1991727	I've seen the GPS-based Pac-Man.
1991747	1992167	That's kind of cool.
1992187	2002792	Well, this one, yeah, they were using more of a radio sensor, and there were people actually dressed up as Pac-Man, and people dressed up as the ghosts.
2003894	2009716	being directed by people basically functioning as the AI.
2010056	2017818	And this was done in New York because they actually had it sectioned out around Central Park where it all mapped out to exactly the Pac-Man grid.
2018678	2020779	But I thought this was pretty cool.
2021419	2029441	And what they're doing is also an experiment on the whole GPS system, but also on integrated gaming.
2032523	2032763	Very cool.
2032783	2034225	All right, well, thanks for that report.
2035686	2037687	Moving on, you might have heard about the Halo movie.
2037848	2040870	Microsoft's been shipping out the Halo movie like mad this week.
2041571	2046295	They sent folks dressed up in Master Chief outfits to deliver the scripts to the studios.
2046395	2048016	Yeah, that's ridiculous.
2048137	2056524	They wanted $10 million plus 15% of the box office revenue, and they wanted a heck of a lot of control over the film as well.
2056544	2057965	They wanted all these seats for the premiere.
2058225	2060087	Now, granted, some of this could be rumor, but...
2060387	2067030	But the internet's saying they wanted seats for the premiere and they wanted control over the actors that were going to be in it and all this stuff.
2067370	2068871	Well, they got some of it.
2069491	2073013	Two studios actually teamed up, Universal Pictures and 20th Century Fox.
2073233	2077355	They're going to offer $5 million and 10% of the initial box office revenue.
2077715	2084479	So we'll be looking at more formal details announced a little later on when all the T's are crossed and I's are dotted.
2084559	2088961	But you can look for a joint studio, Halo the Movie Productions.
2089141	2092462	I'm sure it'll be decent since it's got a pre-generic storyline.
2092562	2101626	We need a decent video game movie, but this could be a good trend because Silent Hill's looking good, Halo has a lot of potential, Spy Hunter... Two words when it comes to a Halo movie.
2102106	2102726	Starship Troopers.
2104027	2106268	Yeah, Starship Troopers wasn't bad.
2106288	2109149	It'd be fun to... What was I going to say?
2109769	2110209	Spy Hunter.
2110870	2112510	That's being worked on Universal.
2113951	2118753	Granted, The Rock's getting it, but The Rock's now becoming a more legitimate actor, so...
2119668	2120308	It could be cool.
2121269	2123369	I wouldn't think there's a lot to work with with Spy Hunter, though.
2123429	2128391	So you have a lot of room to... With Spy Hunter, there's not a lot.
2128411	2129071	You've got the car.
2130332	2138375	With Halo, you've got a very intricate story between Halo, Halo 2, and Microsoft, in fact, wants to make sure that their story does not get screwed up by the movie.
2138455	2140916	That was very important to them because they are going to do a Halo 3.
2140976	2141996	That's a big duh.
2142296	2145277	They want to make sure this movie isn't going to F that up.
2145317	2147178	We don't want to run into Resident Evil syndrome.
2147438	2148780	You know what I'd love to see, though?
2148901	2149181	What's that?
2149241	2150663	It's Red vs. Blue, the movie.
2150884	2151224	Yes!
2151345	2152707	Oh my god, that would be awesome.
2152727	2153709	It's a chupa thingy!
2153789	2160480	They should totally, and I would, because Red vs. Blue has kind of become the spokesperson for Halo, sort of.
2160905	2165206	So what they should do is have, you know how they have cartoon movies, you know how they have the little mini-cartoon?
2165446	2169707	Have a Red vs. Blue little intro movie or something, that'd be kind of cool.
2170487	2174469	I wonder if there's actually been any updates to Red vs. Blue, because I haven't watched it since the second season.
2174489	2176789	They have new seasons, but yeah, anyways.
2176929	2183431	I'm surprised a lot of these things like Red vs. Blue, Homestar Runner, Strangerhood, I love the Strangerhood.
2183451	2186812	I'm surprised they just don't all team up and start their own dang network, honestly.
2187092	2187552	I would watch it.
2188212	2189893	I would... Okay, honestly.
2190293	2190673	Red vs. Blue.
2190713	2191713	Internet TV Radio.
2191733	2192273	No, no, no.
2192333	2192674	Seriously.
2192854	2194754	Red vs. Blue, The Stranger Hood, all these.
2195394	2196855	Do a damn show on G4.
2197095	2200756	G4 has some really weird stuff that doesn't really fit with that gaming network.
2200976	2203017	Like their whole import car thing.
2203497	2203697	Yeah.
2203897	2205298	I mean, that's something that should be on MTV.
2205638	2206518	Put this stuff on there.
2206538	2208018	I mean, it's done for them.
2208059	2208859	Just publish it.
2209099	2209399	The end.
2210711	2211752	I guess it just doesn't sell.
2211872	2212152	I don't know.
2212212	2214754	Anyway, you got a really quick update for us on Liberty City?
2214955	2216276	Oh yes, Liberty City stories.
2216336	2217837	Grand Theft Auto, there's a story.
2218197	2221841	Because basically, another magazine has leaked information.
2222161	2227545	And the magazine in question this time was the official PlayStation Magazine UK edition.
2228446	2229787	Hey, there's some more UK news.
2230308	2231569	Yes, and if you...
2232125	2244170	And for our wonderful podcast listeners, if you mosey on down to OrangeLaunchRadio.com, you can see that in our little read more section, I have included six packages for your enjoyment.
2244530	2249493	Those packages being scans of the actual magazine so you can see the wonderful in-game shots.
2249593	2250453	Start moseying.
2250793	2251494	Start moseying.
2252114	2254695	Basically, it's going to be just like Grand Theft Auto 3.
2254735	2256976	It's going to be in Liberty City.
2257056	2259417	Again, you play as Tony Kipriani.
2260751	2262612	and a 1998 Liberty City.
2262672	2264673	So some of the stuff is going to be a little bit different.
2264693	2268514	They have the same targeting system, motorbikes, as in the later games.
2269235	2273496	The missions are going to be a little bit shorter, but there's going to be more than there were in Grand Theft Auto 3.
2274937	2283020	And basically, one of the theories is you might be able to play your own MP3s off the memory stick on your own radio station, just kind of like the PC version.
2283340	2284541	But that's pretty much it.
2284601	2289703	Different packages and different secret stuff, but definitely worth picking up, and that's going to be coming out, I think, in September.
2290285	2291866	Sounds pretty cool.
2291906	2294187	Going into a very, very different type of game.
2294307	2297828	Dig Dug is coming back and it's going to be on the DS.
2297928	2300289	It's called Dig Dug Digging Strike.
2300750	2301030	Get it?
2301150	2302150	DS, Digging Strike.
2303331	2305392	Going to be coming out in Japan on September 8th.
2305772	2310594	The very interesting thing about Dig Dug Digging Strike is that they are taking elements of the original Dig Dug
2310974	2312175	and mixing it with Dig Dug 2.
2312535	2313656	Did any of you guys ever play Dig Dug 2?
2313836	2314536	I'm sure y'all played Dig Dug 1.
2314576	2314816	Briefly.
2314836	2315156	Barely.
2315256	2322260	Did you ever play Dig Dug 2 with like the island and you were kind of axing off parts of the island?
2322280	2324081	It was a very different style of gameplay.
2324461	2330865	But what they're doing now, and this was actually announced in the latest issue again of Famitsu Magazine, has kind of the...
2331825	2334807	I think it's kind of neat, just the idea of combining two games in a new way for the DS.
2334827	2335767	This is kind of a cool thing.
2335787	2337848	And it doesn't look like it's whoring on the touch thing.
2338249	2341390	It looks like it's using the dual screen aspect of it more than just the touch, which I think is good.
2360282	2361822	It's kind of interesting, you know.
2361902	2363943	The DS doesn't have to be all about touching.
2363983	2367564	I'm sure they will use the touchscreen in one way or another, but I think it's kind of neat.
2368064	2368444	Exactly.
2368744	2370105	All right.
2370605	2372445	Also, moving on, Sega.
2373165	2375526	Sega's launched a brand new community site.
2375606	2384028	It's called Sega Link, and what it does is allows users to create their own blogs and photo albums, and you chat with other users and all that stuff.
2384729	2389530	Sega Link also has a huge library with online games and board games.
2390397	2393878	Simple Games, Sega Classic, and Link Collection is what they call it.
2395639	2407343	The Sega Classic section features Windows ports of Genesis titles like Golden Axe, Phantasy Star, and it would cost you about $1.12 to play for 24 hours.
2407903	2409864	Not too shabby, but here's the bad news.
2410124	2411824	SegaLink.jp.
2411964	2413685	It's a Japanese-only site right now.
2415322	2416303	Credit card dork in Japan.
2418665	2419786	I can get a Japanese address.
2419946	2424910	segalink.jp if you're thinking about going around the back door to get on that site.
2424930	2425551	Might be kind of fun.
2427693	2433978	What I think is interesting about this article is it's talking about the Nintendo Revolution, and of course we don't know a lot about...
2434938	2439361	What the Nintendo Revolution is going to offer, but we do know now one thing that they will not offer.
2439822	2448288	They are saying, and this is GameCube Advanced that is reporting this, the Revolution will not support high definition signals.
2449649	2459257	From the article, quote, Nintendo doesn't plan for the system to be HD compatible as with that comes a higher price for both the consumer and also the developer creating the game.
2459932	2460532	Very interesting.
2460572	2466194	If you want more information on that, gc.advancedmn.com I'm not sure that's a good idea.
2468595	2469176	It's interesting.
2469396	2478979	Because I heard that a lot of the TVs, the analog signals are going to be cut off pretty soon here where they're going to be mandating where they have to make more HD TVs versus analog TVs.
2479019	2480460	Let me read the second part of the quote though.
2480860	2486142	With the technology being built into the revolution, we believe the games will look brilliant and play brilliantly.
2486362	2487943	This can all be done without HD.
2490015	2490636	Uh-huh.
2490816	2491237	Interesting.
2491457	2491737	Uh-huh.
2492118	2496022	I think that their intentions are good as far as making it a more affordable system.
2496382	2499065	Because there are people who will just go out and buy the cheaper one.
2499185	2499425	Mm-hmm.
2499926	2502629	You know, and that will definitely help sales for them.
2502769	2503029	Mm-hmm.
2503289	2508535	However, with the way that the market's behaving, isn't that sort of the same nail that the Dreamcast put it in their coffin?
2508555	2508695	Mm-hmm.
2508755	2509496	Don't know, don't know.
2509856	2511317	Microsoft, it's very interesting.
2511337	2513439	Microsoft and Sony are really whoring the HD thing.
2513479	2517142	Microsoft is saying you must make your games HD compatible.
2517482	2520685	Microsoft has not made a profit on the Xbox yet.
2521926	2522446	You know what?
2523607	2527290	I'm smelling some tricks up Nintendo's sleeve, man.
2527410	2529432	They just blew it right wide open there.
2530112	2530993	Take it as you will.
2531013	2531313	We'll see.
2531354	2531814	We'll see.
2532617	2533878	More to come, I'm sure.
2534559	2536760	One last story tonight for you guys here.
2537761	2541424	And it has to do with Final Fantasy XI because I know Loki is a big Final Fantasy XI whore.
2542125	2546188	Also, another one from Famitsu Magazine who is feeding us with all these articles tonight.
2546889	2549831	Final Fantasy XI producer Hiromichi Takahashi.
2550331	2559718	and Tanaka disclosed that his team is currently working on a new MMO specifically for next generation consoles.
2560238	2562080	Will it be a sequel to Final Fantasy XI?
2562560	2566323	It's unknown at this time, but it will be specifically next generation consoles.
2567284	2570466	And finally, I have a brief, really quick, we're going to sum it up.
2571206	2571646	A few things.
2571966	2573287	Television coming to DS.
2573567	2574768	That looks cool.
2574888	2576109	Is that legit or is that a hack?
2576229	2576829	No, it's legit.
2577310	2581232	Two more games also coming from Capcom to the PSP.
2581712	2586395	Those would be Mega Man Legends and... God, I can't remember the other one.
2586535	2588016	But anyways, Mega Man Legends is coming.
2588036	2589117	That's the one I was happy about.
2589337	2590918	And I think some role-playing game.
2591158	2591999	Fire Emblem or something.
2592899	2593879	Yes, yes.
2593999	2600081	Actually, the new Fire Emblem on GameCube is supposed to be really tremendous, really good.
2600642	2603182	And there's been just a jump up for it.
2603362	2603903	Lots of people.
2605123	2606443	To be continued on a later podcast.
2606503	2617147	And anybody out there listening that's in the PlayStation Portable or DS, you know, home development community, please, please, please port
2617617	2618697	ZZT or Megazooks.
2619197	2619717	Thank you.
2620458	2620838	I agree.
2621018	2622118	ZZT would be needed.
2622338	2622638	Thank you.
2623218	2625179	Alright, that's going to do it for another podcast.
2625339	2625899	Final thoughts.
2625959	2626259	Loki.
2628659	2638421	I hope I can beat WarioWare Twisted and I hope I can get my Grand Theft Auto San Andreas back because I need to play it and I hope the PC version is done being purchased onto my computer.
2639521	2641022	DarkSakura, your final thought.
