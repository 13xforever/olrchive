[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of June 20th, 2005.

00:03.415 --> 00:14.600
[SPEAKER_00]: You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

00:14.860 --> 00:18.342
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

00:20.140 --> 00:29.448
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, everybody, and welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio To Go, video game radio dedicated to games that don't suck.

00:29.528 --> 00:32.831
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, you know, once in a while, we got to talk about some games that suck.

00:32.871 --> 00:37.855
[SPEAKER_03]: And tonight, towards the end of the program, we're going to talk about movies that are going to suck, I assure you.

00:38.275 --> 00:39.216
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts.

00:39.256 --> 00:40.237
[SPEAKER_03]: You might know me as Sky.

00:40.277 --> 00:43.960
[SPEAKER_03]: Joining me as always, my awesome co-host, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:44.605 --> 00:48.808
[SPEAKER_01]: Dust, dust, dust, dirt, and cat poo.

00:50.229 --> 00:51.170
[SPEAKER_03]: How very random.

00:51.210 --> 00:51.911
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind?

00:52.131 --> 00:54.713
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been moving and changing cat litter.

00:55.593 --> 00:55.974
[SPEAKER_01]: Fun.

00:56.534 --> 00:59.336
[SPEAKER_01]: My life is a never-ending swirl of dust.

00:59.376 --> 01:00.657
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm in Kansas.

01:00.817 --> 01:03.860
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought maybe you were finding cat poo in very hideous places.

01:03.980 --> 01:07.262
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, that would be a cat who would be in a lot of trouble.

01:07.282 --> 01:07.783
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

01:08.944 --> 01:11.471
[SPEAKER_03]: Also joining us, the one and only, infamous Loki!

01:11.812 --> 01:14.179
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take the contents of my wallet for 500, Alex.

01:17.546 --> 01:20.047
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?

01:20.427 --> 01:21.048
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hungry.

01:21.428 --> 01:26.810
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't eaten since 2pm and it's now, what, 7 hours later?

01:27.310 --> 01:28.390
[SPEAKER_02]: You could have some damn.

01:28.911 --> 01:29.951
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want any damn.

01:30.371 --> 01:33.392
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn, by the way, is the candy I got at Ikea that looks like Heath Bars.

01:33.452 --> 01:39.115
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of been a running gag all night long on our 3-hour program that we do on Sunday nights via OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

01:39.135 --> 01:40.395
[SPEAKER_01]: They would know that if they were listening.

01:41.715 --> 01:45.537
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been passing my time by grading sedans.

01:46.420 --> 01:47.440
[SPEAKER_03]: Grading Sedans.

01:47.720 --> 01:48.721
[SPEAKER_02]: Grading Sedans.

01:48.761 --> 01:49.181
[SPEAKER_02]: How so?

01:49.261 --> 01:49.821
[SPEAKER_02]: Like cheese.

01:50.121 --> 01:52.422
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I know what you're talking about because I grate SUVs.

01:53.322 --> 01:54.742
[SPEAKER_03]: The one and only WarioWare Twisted.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.343
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have nerves that get grated.

01:57.383 --> 02:07.266
[SPEAKER_02]: I also found that there's one game in there that's completely easy to play and you can get infinite levels on because it requires you to do nothing.

02:08.526 --> 02:09.046
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

02:10.967 --> 02:11.367
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

02:13.280 --> 02:14.481
[SPEAKER_03]: Mind games with my fiancÃ©.

02:14.541 --> 02:14.961
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, um...

02:28.723 --> 02:31.805
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just a required part of being engaged to a guy.

02:32.885 --> 02:37.548
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't really had a lot of time to play any games, except I did play some PSO this week.

02:38.388 --> 02:40.269
[SPEAKER_01]: I had forgotten I did play some PSO.

02:40.289 --> 02:42.251
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, wait, I thought Blue Burst beta closed.

02:42.291 --> 02:43.071
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you talking about Xbox?

02:43.151 --> 02:45.732
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm paying for PSO Blue Burst.

02:45.812 --> 02:49.334
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought there was going to be a gap between... It went live.

02:49.475 --> 02:50.175
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, cool.

02:50.515 --> 02:54.077
[SPEAKER_01]: So I paid on Monday and played on Wednesday.

02:54.157 --> 02:56.158
[SPEAKER_03]: Is Blue Burst going to be sold over the counter?

02:56.318 --> 02:57.319
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's downloadable.

02:58.072 --> 02:59.033
[SPEAKER_03]: Puzzle Pirates Puzzle Pirates

03:14.200 --> 03:16.862
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan's been playing a lot of Initial D ever since I got my car.

03:17.943 --> 03:21.846
[SPEAKER_01]: For those who don't know, I have a 2002 Mitsubishi Lancer OZ Rally.

03:22.247 --> 03:29.512
[SPEAKER_01]: Now he's talking about getting an Evolution, so he's been going crazy on Initial D on PS2, making Evolutions.

03:29.593 --> 03:30.794
[SPEAKER_01]: He's playing an Evo 7 right now.

03:30.954 --> 03:33.736
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can imagine you are probably sick of Eurobeat at this point.

03:35.129 --> 03:38.410
[SPEAKER_01]: and he comes in my car and drives it and makes me listen to Eurobeat.

03:38.450 --> 03:39.311
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, no, no, no.

03:39.891 --> 03:41.051
[SPEAKER_03]: Gorillas.

03:41.091 --> 03:44.332
[SPEAKER_03]: He does realize that your Lancer is not Initial D, right?

03:45.373 --> 03:46.693
[SPEAKER_01]: He got challenged to a race, though.

03:47.473 --> 03:48.994
[SPEAKER_01]: I got challenged to a race.

03:49.894 --> 03:50.954
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, turn.

03:53.555 --> 03:54.455
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a 2.0.

03:54.956 --> 03:55.516
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way.

03:56.576 --> 04:02.238
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it would have smoked the little piece of crap Civic Hybrid that was challenging me.

04:03.656 --> 04:05.197
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do people do that, seriously?

04:05.297 --> 04:06.038
[SPEAKER_03]: Get a life, people.

04:06.598 --> 04:08.239
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what have you been up to, game-wise?

04:08.259 --> 04:15.963
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason why they do that is because they see movies like Too Fast, Too Furious, and Fast and the Furious, and the insert racing movie here.

04:16.544 --> 04:19.465
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because, yeah, they're stupid.

04:19.886 --> 04:29.211
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, I've been playing WarioWare Twisted today, and I'm trying to unlock all the wonderful goodies there, and there's tons to unlock.

04:30.145 --> 04:32.970
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

04:41.670 --> 04:42.510
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been passing my time.

04:42.610 --> 04:48.052
[SPEAKER_02]: But the controls, the only thing that pisses me off is the camera doesn't change with you when you turn in the PC version.

04:48.533 --> 04:53.475
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to adjust the camera with the mouse at the same time and it's not very convenient for me.

04:53.895 --> 04:59.517
[SPEAKER_02]: So I need to find a way to get it to move the camera with it or something so I can actually play the game.

04:59.537 --> 05:01.438
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you try the special mod?

05:02.558 --> 05:03.659
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't gotten to that.

05:04.119 --> 05:07.420
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I tried to take her out on a date and she wanted to, you know,

05:08.263 --> 05:12.468
[SPEAKER_02]: Do a drive-by, because that's what you do on dates in Los Santos, I guess.

05:14.110 --> 05:16.313
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that sex mod was a load of crap.

05:17.597 --> 05:18.297
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

05:18.718 --> 05:20.658
[SPEAKER_03]: I showed you the stuff from that last week.

05:20.678 --> 05:23.239
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was shown to be a Photoshop or something.

05:23.259 --> 05:24.519
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was real.

05:24.779 --> 05:25.680
[SPEAKER_02]: I have video.

05:25.920 --> 05:26.600
[SPEAKER_02]: I have video of it.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.000
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a Photoshop.

05:28.020 --> 05:28.320
[SPEAKER_02]: Weird.

05:28.540 --> 05:29.361
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, all right.

05:29.761 --> 05:33.202
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in other news also... It doesn't surprise me, sadly.

05:33.222 --> 05:38.463
[SPEAKER_02]: In other news, that mod, they've made it for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions of the game.

05:38.583 --> 05:40.544
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get patches for it.

05:41.224 --> 05:43.825
[SPEAKER_03]: People will see their boobies no matter what it takes.

06:03.351 --> 06:08.315
[SPEAKER_02]: You have an army of sluts carrying dildos and vibrators and they are chasing after you.

06:08.395 --> 06:13.298
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, you are in a gimp outfit with a dildo.

06:14.759 --> 06:17.181
[SPEAKER_02]: I was killing people with the dildo.

06:17.561 --> 06:22.084
[SPEAKER_02]: I went through and adjusted the damage rates for each weapon.

06:22.124 --> 06:29.530
[SPEAKER_02]: My spray paint was pure anthrax or something because it was instant death for everything that basically touched it.

06:30.450 --> 06:31.211
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a lot of fun.

06:32.242 --> 06:36.224
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and we wonder why parents complain about these games.

06:39.906 --> 06:40.246
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

06:40.286 --> 06:47.209
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, to finish how that date went, my car ended up getting shot up and then exploded and then that was the end of that date.

06:48.149 --> 06:52.171
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a nice story that could only be told in Grand Theft Auto.

06:53.232 --> 06:53.612
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else?

06:55.489 --> 06:57.150
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that's all the games I played this week.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.571
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, oh, no, I actually did try playing some of the emulators.

07:00.631 --> 07:03.172
[SPEAKER_02]: I played a little bit of Doom on my PSP.

07:03.332 --> 07:05.973
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you've got to tell us about this in a little bit, the PSP stuff.

07:05.993 --> 07:06.774
[SPEAKER_03]: That was big news this week.

07:07.074 --> 07:10.295
[SPEAKER_03]: Real quick, I'll tell you about mine, because I actually didn't get a chance to play a whole lot of new games.

07:10.575 --> 07:12.196
[SPEAKER_03]: I've still been playing WarioWare Twisted.

07:12.236 --> 07:13.876
[SPEAKER_03]: I only really touched the surface of it.

07:13.976 --> 07:15.217
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm really into the game.

07:15.817 --> 07:17.718
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just trying to unlock more souvenirs.

07:18.338 --> 07:20.359
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to say, WarioWare graphics...

07:20.939 --> 07:49.564
[SPEAKER_03]: typically what you're used to in WarioWare sound is you know again what you'd be used to bleeps and bloops nothing too exciting except there are records that you can unlock which is kind of cool because you can unlock like the old Kid Icarus theme as a record and by the way a big F you to Nintendo because the little caption that shows up when you unlock the Kid Icarus record is it says this is the closest thing to a sequel you're gonna get har har har and I'm like bastards you need to do a Kid Icarus sequel but um

07:50.245 --> 07:56.670
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get records and then you can scratch it using like the twist, you know, because the whole concept of WarioWare Twisted is that you move the thing around, so it's kind of cool.

07:56.990 --> 07:57.631
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a lot of fun.

07:58.031 --> 07:58.791
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised.

07:58.871 --> 08:03.475
[SPEAKER_03]: WarioWare Twisted looked kind of dumb to me and I was not a big fan of the twist idea, but...

08:04.164 --> 08:08.025
[SPEAKER_03]: Just goes to show you got to actually sit down and play the game because I'm having a lot of fun with it.

08:08.085 --> 08:10.286
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually really like the twist concept.

08:10.326 --> 08:11.027
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of fun.

08:11.467 --> 08:12.367
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm having fun with the game.

08:12.387 --> 08:13.908
[SPEAKER_03]: So I definitely recommend it.

08:14.408 --> 08:15.228
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to pet the kitty.

08:16.188 --> 08:18.429
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the coolest unlock that you have, Loki.

08:18.449 --> 08:24.511
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have this one yet, but the Mutroid or whatever with the cat with the gun that rolls around on its back and shoots things.

08:24.531 --> 08:25.752
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I want to do the pet the kitty.

08:26.332 --> 08:30.054
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a lot of... Well, that was cute, but I want to shoot things with the kitty.

08:30.194 --> 08:31.234
[SPEAKER_01]: We need Ninten cats.

08:31.499 --> 08:36.461
[SPEAKER_02]: They have some other fun stuff in there, like you can unlock mini-golf, like a mini-golf game.

08:36.481 --> 08:38.481
[SPEAKER_02]: You can unlock a batting practice game.

08:38.942 --> 08:40.822
[SPEAKER_02]: You can unlock a ton of stuff.

08:40.922 --> 08:53.386
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the mini-games that are tucked away in there, and I think that's where Twisted is really excelling over Touched, because the mini-games in Touched were kind of eh, which is too bad, because Touched, you know, the stylus thing is such a cool idea.

08:54.147 --> 08:56.507
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised it wasn't utilized, but maybe the game was rushed.

08:56.547 --> 08:56.908
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

08:57.288 --> 08:57.728
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

08:57.868 --> 08:58.148
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

08:59.551 --> 09:02.795
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Loki, some big game news this week.

09:02.835 --> 09:15.329
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to let you start off tonight because that PSP hacking is just... When I saw one of my friends playing Legend of Zelda on the PSP, I was just like, there is something really, really wrong with this picture yet so...

09:16.118 --> 09:17.759
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

09:39.522 --> 09:44.665
[SPEAKER_02]: You basically have two memory cards, and one of them can be any memory card size.

09:44.845 --> 09:51.089
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you put a small little file on there in a directory, and you put that same directory on another memory card.

09:51.109 --> 09:54.311
[SPEAKER_02]: The second memory card is the one that actually has the program on it.

09:54.692 --> 09:58.694
[SPEAKER_02]: So you put the first memory card in, and you load up the program.

09:58.774 --> 10:03.037
[SPEAKER_02]: And while it's loading, you really quickly swap in the one that has the actual program on it.

10:03.652 --> 10:04.453
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.

10:32.194 --> 10:33.239
[SPEAKER_02]: What it's supposed to run at, 333 MHz.

10:36.792 --> 10:38.333
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's pretty cool Nintendo stuff.

10:38.454 --> 10:40.495
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't got a Nintendo emulator to work on mine.

10:40.656 --> 10:41.556
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to try it again.

10:42.057 --> 10:46.080
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, it looked like it runs games pretty full speed.

10:46.160 --> 10:48.302
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually saw it on one of my friend's PSPs and it looked great.

10:48.843 --> 10:49.483
[SPEAKER_03]: I was impressed.

10:49.524 --> 10:50.965
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just, wow.

10:51.285 --> 11:02.095
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though these games we've played to death, there's just something about having that whole catalog of games opened up, able to play on the go, on a nice looking screen that is just...

11:02.865 --> 11:03.946
[SPEAKER_03]: So neat to me.

11:04.046 --> 11:04.366
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

11:04.426 --> 11:06.007
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes me want a PSP even more.

11:06.427 --> 11:09.750
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, I was kind of like, yeah, I want a PSP, but what do I really want it for?

11:09.790 --> 11:12.812
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to play Luminous and whatever cool games they release in the future.

11:12.852 --> 11:18.475
[SPEAKER_03]: But now I'm like, wow, with this trick, I could play the old Nintendo catalog and who knows what else.

11:18.495 --> 11:18.756
[SPEAKER_03]: For now.

11:18.796 --> 11:22.578
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for now until they... When's this story going to come to an end here?

11:22.598 --> 11:23.579
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there...

11:24.079 --> 11:32.884
[SPEAKER_02]: They've announced already that you can upgrade your system to a version 1.52 over, you know, you can do a network update, that type of thing.

11:33.424 --> 11:36.406
[SPEAKER_02]: But who's going to do that because they'll stop you from playing it.

11:36.546 --> 11:49.994
[SPEAKER_02]: However, in Japan, the same type of thing is happening with the version 1.0 stuff where they'll upgrade yours to 1.52 by playing certain games and they'll have a firmware update on the actual game and they'll force you to update it in order to play that game.

11:50.974 --> 12:08.378
[SPEAKER_02]: so it kind of sucks but there are ways around it still and people are going to find ways around that too I mean you just watch so it's right now just enjoy it while you have it I mean and avoid those games that will force you to update so that's pretty much it yeah okay we'll see

12:09.031 --> 12:10.271
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else you want to share really quickly?

12:10.311 --> 12:12.672
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on in the hacking and cracking world or anything?

12:12.832 --> 12:15.933
[SPEAKER_03]: I imagine that's probably the biggest thing that's got everybody's attention right now.

12:16.013 --> 12:17.034
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's the biggest thing right now.

12:17.074 --> 12:21.955
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got the Heretic WAD works with the Doom thing.

12:22.015 --> 12:30.618
[SPEAKER_02]: But the second thing that actually was just released not too long ago, which is probably within the hour, was the PSP Personalized version 1.0.

12:31.338 --> 12:36.880
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically what that does is you know how the PSP has the wonderful graphics in the background and changes color with the month?

12:37.469 --> 12:38.049
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

12:57.620 --> 12:59.581
[SPEAKER_02]: Weather stuff they've got coming out.

12:59.641 --> 13:02.323
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone else is working on a custom boot-up screen video.

13:02.343 --> 13:04.724
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how they have the little PSP screen boot-up thing?

13:04.865 --> 13:10.368
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now you'll be able to put your own video in there, and that's something that's going to be coming yet again later on.

13:10.668 --> 13:16.852
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, there is more information released about Liberty City Stories, the Grand Theft Auto version that's going to be coming out.

13:16.872 --> 13:19.353
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, it's the same stuff we already know.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.896
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not going to be aircraft in it.

13:22.996 --> 13:26.598
[SPEAKER_02]: The main character, Tony, is going to be voiced by Michael Madsen, which is kind of cool.

13:27.853 --> 13:30.134
[SPEAKER_02]: The graphics will be better than Grand Theft Auto 3.

13:31.214 --> 13:34.174
[SPEAKER_02]: New landmarks are going to be available in Liberty City this time.

13:35.155 --> 13:38.975
[SPEAKER_02]: The motorcycles will be in there as well because you can ride motorcycles.

13:39.215 --> 13:41.536
[SPEAKER_02]: And the story will be as long as Vice City.

13:41.676 --> 13:42.796
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not hack and crack news.

13:43.376 --> 13:45.097
[SPEAKER_03]: You snuck that in there just because you're a Grand Theft Auto fan.

13:45.137 --> 13:46.597
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because I like that stuff.

13:46.637 --> 13:46.997
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

13:47.057 --> 13:51.138
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, Genesis Emulator was released for it, so that's kind of neat.

13:52.038 --> 14:13.561
[SPEAKER_02]: and other than that check PSPHacker.com it's a good resource for finding all your homebrew stuff as far as all the brand new releases for the emulators and what not for those of you guys that are going crazy over the PSP news this week PSPHacker.com and they also have their sister site which is DSHacker.com but obviously not as much news going on over there

14:14.821 --> 14:15.901
[SPEAKER_03]: Matrix Online is being sold.

14:40.262 --> 14:42.044
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony Online Entertainment

14:54.002 --> 14:54.983
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm impartial to it.

14:55.263 --> 14:55.983
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really matter.

14:56.083 --> 14:59.766
[SPEAKER_01]: What if Matrix Online becomes part of the whole PlayOnline lineup?

15:00.306 --> 15:02.027
[SPEAKER_01]: Because all they have are, what, two games?

15:02.187 --> 15:07.990
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know if it necessarily becomes PlayOnline because EverQuest is also Sony and it's not a part of PlayOnline.

15:08.331 --> 15:11.593
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I remember right, PlayOnline is specifically half Square as well.

15:11.793 --> 15:12.293
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

15:12.313 --> 15:13.114
[SPEAKER_03]: Square has nothing to do with this.

15:13.134 --> 15:15.415
[SPEAKER_02]: And Square doesn't just have Final Fantasy XI.

15:15.435 --> 15:20.418
[SPEAKER_02]: They have, well, the Count Tetra Master, but they also have Front Mission Online, their other online game that's going to be coming out.

15:20.438 --> 15:22.319
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have a Mahjong game in Japan, I believe.

15:22.519 --> 15:22.719
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

15:22.739 --> 15:23.280
[SPEAKER_03]: From what I remember.

15:23.300 --> 15:23.700
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.371
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I would do Front Mission Online.

15:25.831 --> 15:26.392
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be fun.

15:26.452 --> 15:27.333
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming out for consoles.

15:28.594 --> 15:29.555
[SPEAKER_03]: So that should just be interesting.

15:29.575 --> 15:39.303
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Matrix Online, even though we haven't really played it a whole lot and haven't been able to give you a lot of perspective, I kind of think it's neat, some of their ideas, that they have the actual actors playing in the game.

15:39.383 --> 15:40.624
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of neat, I guess.

15:40.724 --> 15:41.244
[SPEAKER_03]: It's different.

15:41.665 --> 15:45.808
[SPEAKER_03]: I can applaud a company that takes different ideas on MMOs and games, so whatever.

15:46.228 --> 15:46.469
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

15:46.489 --> 15:46.589
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

15:48.636 --> 15:52.058
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on to another story that is just too cool for words.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.339
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so excited about this.

15:54.640 --> 16:01.023
[SPEAKER_03]: This website here, a blogger, I should say, PressTheButtons.com, is reporting that the Super Mario Bros.

16:01.084 --> 16:05.306
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Show is going to be released on DVD.

16:05.746 --> 16:09.709
[SPEAKER_03]: A complete series of the programs are going to be released on DVD.

16:09.749 --> 16:15.392
[SPEAKER_03]: This will include all the Mario cartoons and the Zelda cartoons to be released this October.

16:15.452 --> 16:16.873
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been done before.

16:17.963 --> 16:19.584
[SPEAKER_02]: But with only some episodes.

16:19.644 --> 16:20.745
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, it was like a best of.

16:20.925 --> 16:27.990
[SPEAKER_03]: So the best of has happened previously, but I suppose due to demand or torrents or whatever, they're going to release the complete series.

16:28.851 --> 16:33.153
[SPEAKER_03]: I am actually considering buying this because I have such fond memories of watching this when I was growing up.

16:33.253 --> 16:33.654
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

16:34.134 --> 16:38.117
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about you guys out there, but this show, I remember Friday's Zelda cartoons.

16:38.537 --> 16:40.558
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, excuse me, princess.

16:41.159 --> 16:41.719
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just cool.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.100
[SPEAKER_03]: Any thoughts, Loki?

16:43.300 --> 16:44.521
[SPEAKER_03]: Something you'd consider buying or...

16:44.913 --> 16:47.614
[SPEAKER_02]: I was watching the Nintendo Entertainment Serial System thing.

16:47.654 --> 16:48.354
[SPEAKER_02]: That commercial was awful!

17:09.627 --> 17:13.510
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you go back and watch some of those episodes of Mario, some of them were really awful.

17:13.850 --> 17:15.812
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Super Mario World ones were really good.

17:15.832 --> 17:17.333
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's Captain Lou.

17:17.393 --> 17:18.113
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Mario.

17:18.413 --> 17:18.954
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

17:19.294 --> 17:23.036
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, it's like they made sound effects when they walked.

17:23.497 --> 17:25.098
[SPEAKER_03]: But I thought that was cute.

17:25.298 --> 17:25.738
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

17:27.139 --> 17:27.539
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

17:28.340 --> 17:29.541
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you thinking about buying this?

17:30.299 --> 17:31.300
[SPEAKER_03]: You own a ton of DVDs.

17:31.340 --> 17:32.841
[SPEAKER_03]: Surely you have to add this one to your collection.

17:33.422 --> 17:34.543
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, probably not.

17:35.123 --> 17:36.724
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working on box sets of stuff.

17:36.744 --> 17:39.026
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to finish the Samurai Troopers set.

17:39.627 --> 17:40.948
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine, fine.

17:41.428 --> 17:42.509
[SPEAKER_03]: Hate on Mario Brothers.

17:42.569 --> 17:42.889
[SPEAKER_03]: See if I care.

17:42.909 --> 17:44.851
[SPEAKER_01]: It says that I have all the episodes of Zelda on my computer.

17:45.371 --> 17:45.652
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

17:46.352 --> 17:47.793
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, moving on.

17:48.054 --> 17:49.295
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to address real fast.

17:49.315 --> 17:52.597
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys ever have any comments or feedback on the show, you can always send us an email.

17:53.038 --> 17:56.420
[SPEAKER_03]: 2go at orangeloungeradio.com is the address.

17:56.781 --> 17:57.181
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh,

17:57.968 --> 17:58.609
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

18:21.448 --> 18:25.010
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's do a quick follow-up to a story we were talking about a couple weeks ago.

18:25.530 --> 18:28.852
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony is talking about those porno UMDs.

18:28.912 --> 18:32.514
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember we were talking about a couple weeks ago they're going to release pornos on the PSP?

18:33.074 --> 18:36.396
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, out of Tokyo, Sony Computer Entertainment

18:36.826 --> 18:45.470
[SPEAKER_03]: They are frowning at this whole thing, calling this stuff, quote, utterly undesirable, but we cannot stop software makers from selling such videos.

18:46.991 --> 18:54.114
[SPEAKER_03]: An interesting thing to note, software releases for the PSP, they have to go through an approval process before they can be released.

18:54.174 --> 18:58.996
[SPEAKER_03]: However, the movies on the UMDs do not have to go through an approval process.

18:59.056 --> 19:02.178
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the loophole that the porno games are going through, so...

19:03.508 --> 19:05.830
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy XII, big news is coming from Squeenix

19:27.721 --> 19:31.002
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be doing a party over in Tokyo, their summer gaming event.

19:31.042 --> 19:32.162
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Square Enix Party 2005.

19:32.883 --> 19:37.824
[SPEAKER_03]: It happens July 30 and 31 at the Nippon Convention Center.

19:39.144 --> 19:44.346
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's going to happen is that Nobuo Uematsu will actually be there, and he'll be talking about the game and showing off some new footage.

19:45.206 --> 19:48.087
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll also be having some of the voice actors there as well.

19:48.147 --> 19:54.928
[SPEAKER_03]: The music supervisor will be there, and they'll have more new information, including some type of surprise.

19:55.909 --> 19:56.449
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys think...

19:57.366 --> 19:58.487
[SPEAKER_03]: You might know any of the surprises.

19:58.527 --> 20:02.309
[SPEAKER_03]: Any guesses what the big Final Fantasy XII surprise could be?

20:02.749 --> 20:03.690
[SPEAKER_03]: You're on candid camera.

20:04.770 --> 20:06.871
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe Final Fantasy V is hidden in the game?

20:08.252 --> 20:09.933
[SPEAKER_01]: Which was the best of them all?

20:10.553 --> 20:18.498
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, after seeing the footage at E3, the new Final Fantasy XII trailer, because they didn't really show any bits of the game, they only showed the trailer.

20:19.167 --> 20:22.348
[SPEAKER_03]: I seriously think it has something to do with an X-Gen system.

20:22.368 --> 20:23.268
[SPEAKER_03]: Surprise!

20:23.368 --> 20:24.509
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cross-gen.

20:24.589 --> 20:26.049
[SPEAKER_02]: It's PS3 and PS2.

20:26.189 --> 20:30.171
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I think maybe with Final Fantasy XI it could be Xbox 360.

20:30.231 --> 20:39.294
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, again, I'm speculating, but, you know, maybe it was the PS2, but I was just like, dang, this looks too good to be PS2.

20:39.314 --> 20:42.135
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but which system had a tech demo for Final Fantasy VII?

20:42.475 --> 20:42.955
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

20:43.675 --> 20:44.515
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, true, true.

20:45.736 --> 20:46.416
[SPEAKER_03]: That, I would...

20:47.751 --> 20:48.812
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my initial thought.

20:48.852 --> 20:51.113
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet it's something minor and who cares about it.

20:51.153 --> 20:53.435
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably just some in-game tactic or something.

20:53.495 --> 20:53.775
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

20:53.795 --> 20:57.478
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe one of the voice actors has a really big name or the theme song or something.

20:58.038 --> 21:00.079
[SPEAKER_03]: Al Pacino will play the main character.

21:00.099 --> 21:02.381
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what though?

21:02.441 --> 21:03.682
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't that be interesting if it was cross-gen?

21:03.702 --> 21:15.690
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind though, back in the day on the Nintendo 64, they did all the Final Fantasy 6 characters for a tech demo for the Nintendo 64.

21:15.890 --> 21:17.171
[SPEAKER_01]: I vaguely recall this.

21:18.552 --> 21:20.213
[SPEAKER_01]: Square jumped into bed with Sony.

21:21.294 --> 21:21.755
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

21:22.395 --> 21:24.377
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've been fucking around ever since.

21:26.098 --> 21:27.279
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, am I wrong?

21:27.539 --> 21:31.383
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now Microsoft's getting, you know, coming in and wanting to get their hands on it.

21:31.483 --> 21:35.026
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the background, your cheating heart plays on the jukebox.

21:37.288 --> 21:38.408
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, I don't know.

21:38.628 --> 21:41.329
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just some speculation, you know.

21:41.709 --> 21:45.930
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the record, I would love to find a ROM or something of that demo.

21:46.290 --> 21:47.431
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know it exists.

21:48.211 --> 21:50.151
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the one for Robotech Crystal Dreams.

21:51.211 --> 21:51.572
[SPEAKER_01]: Playable.

21:52.572 --> 21:53.032
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

21:53.732 --> 21:54.712
[SPEAKER_01]: We need more Robotech games.

21:54.932 --> 21:55.632
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we'll see.

21:55.652 --> 21:57.833
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all we can really do here on the show is speculate.

21:57.853 --> 21:59.133
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just gamers like the rest of you.

21:59.173 --> 22:03.074
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that would be kind of a neat news, though, if it is cross-gen.

22:03.114 --> 22:05.895
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think I'm just crazy talk.

22:07.048 --> 22:08.408
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you have a suggestion, send it to us.

22:08.428 --> 22:09.129
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's okay.

22:09.169 --> 22:09.849
[SPEAKER_01]: We're used to it.

22:10.289 --> 22:10.849
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, whatever.

22:11.829 --> 22:12.110
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

22:13.010 --> 22:22.793
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio, we're not just here to talk about video games all the time, but we're here to better your life because if we talked about games all the time and never went outside, we'd have no time to take over the world.

22:23.773 --> 22:32.036
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are here to bring you some advice to better your life, and who better to bring it to you than the one and only, the huggable Dark Sakura with her advice column.

22:32.336 --> 22:33.436
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you saying I'm cuddly?

22:34.076 --> 22:34.656
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I am.

22:35.717 --> 22:36.037
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn it.

22:36.874 --> 22:41.017
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's bit of sage advice is how to treat a broken nose.

22:42.498 --> 22:43.079
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one.

22:43.539 --> 22:44.399
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop the bleeding.

22:44.660 --> 22:45.040
[SPEAKER_01]: Duh.

22:46.001 --> 22:47.422
[SPEAKER_01]: Tilt your head back slightly.

22:47.802 --> 22:52.685
[SPEAKER_01]: Pinch the bridge of your nose closed, the region just below the hard cartilage, not simply the nostrils.

22:53.066 --> 22:55.528
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold a tissue underneath your nostrils to catch the blood.

22:56.328 --> 22:56.588
[SPEAKER_01]: Icky.

22:57.289 --> 22:57.529
[SPEAKER_01]: Two.

22:58.109 --> 22:59.650
[SPEAKER_01]: Apply a cold pack or ice immediately.

22:59.711 --> 23:00.811
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep your head tilted back.

23:00.871 --> 23:03.393
[SPEAKER_01]: Continue to apply ice as needed to keep the swelling down.

23:04.114 --> 23:04.374
[SPEAKER_01]: Three.

23:04.870 --> 23:08.051
[SPEAKER_01]: If your nose appears broken or crooked, do not attempt to treat it yourself.

23:08.671 --> 23:13.072
[SPEAKER_01]: The only reason to attempt to relocate the position of the nose is if you are having trouble breathing through your mouth.

23:14.012 --> 23:21.194
[SPEAKER_01]: If you aren't getting any air, you can attempt to relocate the position of your nose so that you can breathe through it, but this will be quite painful.

23:21.674 --> 23:22.875
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, leave it to the doctor.

23:23.195 --> 23:25.635
[SPEAKER_01]: Four, seek medical attention immediately.

23:26.215 --> 23:28.616
[SPEAKER_01]: But my final, final bit of advice on that one?

23:28.736 --> 23:28.976
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

23:29.736 --> 23:32.277
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go getting into the bar fights pissed on Miller Lite.

23:35.694 --> 23:36.995
[SPEAKER_03]: Some sage advice there, thank you.

23:37.375 --> 23:37.876
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.

23:38.416 --> 23:39.317
[SPEAKER_01]: I always give good advice.

23:39.797 --> 23:40.057
[SPEAKER_03]: You do.

23:40.558 --> 23:40.758
[SPEAKER_03]: You do.

23:41.218 --> 23:41.999
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, once in a while.

23:43.160 --> 23:43.800
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kidding.

23:43.840 --> 23:48.784
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you never know when you're going to be stuck in Brazil crossing a piranha-infested river, okay?

23:49.624 --> 23:50.745
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know.

23:51.145 --> 23:51.446
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

23:51.526 --> 23:52.847
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just doing that the other week.

23:53.307 --> 23:55.789
[SPEAKER_01]: And when was the last time you jumped off the roof of a building?

23:57.070 --> 23:57.410
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

23:58.331 --> 23:58.771
[SPEAKER_01]: See?

23:59.091 --> 23:59.892
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, alright.

24:00.512 --> 24:05.076
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I had to stop a runaway camel the other day and I would not have known had I not researched it.

24:05.888 --> 24:07.528
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, my bad, I'm sorry.

24:07.889 --> 24:08.469
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright then.

24:08.669 --> 24:10.869
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about Mega Man Legends.

24:11.369 --> 24:15.151
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Loki kind of brought this up briefly last week, but this is hitting the newswire now.

24:15.231 --> 24:20.872
[SPEAKER_03]: Mega Man Legends 2 is coming to the PSP, and it's shipping on September 8th.

24:21.012 --> 24:21.852
[SPEAKER_03]: They have an announced date.

24:22.172 --> 24:26.174
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, by the way, that's a Japan shipping date, not an American shipping date yet.

24:26.194 --> 24:28.034
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, why don't they work on Legends 3 while they're at it?

24:28.814 --> 24:31.435
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I already finished the first two games, and I want more.

24:33.551 --> 24:41.053
[SPEAKER_03]: Mega Man Legends is coming out August 4th for the PSP Breath of Fire 3 on August 25th.

24:41.713 --> 24:43.634
[SPEAKER_03]: Direct port to their PlayStation Originals.

24:44.314 --> 24:46.614
[SPEAKER_03]: But they will be reformatted to the widescreen thing.

24:47.114 --> 24:47.494
[SPEAKER_03]: Go figure.

24:48.675 --> 24:50.235
[SPEAKER_03]: So all those games coming out in Japan.

24:51.295 --> 24:52.135
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully here too.

24:53.276 --> 24:53.856
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll find out.

24:54.516 --> 24:58.517
[SPEAKER_01]: I do believe that there was also a release date for Papakuros.

24:59.725 --> 25:00.866
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't been following that one.

25:00.926 --> 25:03.128
[SPEAKER_01]: I do believe that they said August.

25:03.408 --> 25:03.849
[SPEAKER_01]: September.

25:05.010 --> 25:06.010
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a month difference.

25:06.451 --> 25:07.151
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.

25:07.452 --> 25:14.117
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of you guys that like the music games, by the way, we have some dates for DDR Extreme 2 and DDR Ultramix 3.

25:15.258 --> 25:22.784
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR Extreme 2 is going to be out September the 28th with Extreme 2 on September the 28th and Ultramix 3 I get so confused, on November the 2nd.

25:28.137 --> 25:28.697
[SPEAKER_03]: are those games.

25:28.917 --> 25:31.538
[SPEAKER_03]: But of course, subject to change as all shipping dates are.

25:34.259 --> 25:39.881
[SPEAKER_03]: Miyamoto has been talking about Mario 128, you know that official sequel to Mario 64?

25:39.981 --> 25:43.783
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the hell Super Mario Sunshine was then, but I guess it wasn't an actual sequel.

25:45.544 --> 25:49.305
[SPEAKER_03]: Mario 128 is the actual planned sequel, and he has officially said...

25:50.174 --> 25:51.575
[SPEAKER_03]: It ain't happening on GameCube.

25:51.955 --> 25:54.896
[SPEAKER_03]: However, they will be doing it on Revolution.

25:55.356 --> 26:01.099
[SPEAKER_03]: The Mario team can't create too many games at the same time, so they are concentrating on the Revolution.

26:03.024 --> 26:03.744
[SPEAKER_03]: Any thoughts on this?

26:03.824 --> 26:04.844
[SPEAKER_03]: Should be some good stuff.

26:04.904 --> 26:06.005
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Mario 64.

26:07.185 --> 26:17.327
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Mario 64 is slightly overrated in the halls of video game history, but I think it's a fun game and I will certainly be all over a sequel.

26:17.427 --> 26:18.707
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it could be good.

26:18.767 --> 26:23.348
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan and I would play that game together every night for the first few months that I moved out here.

26:23.668 --> 26:25.068
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you think of the DS one, though?

26:25.088 --> 26:27.889
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you play that at all or was the magic gone by that point?

26:28.609 --> 26:29.649
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in school.

26:30.734 --> 26:31.214
[SPEAKER_01]: Caracuri, Gimmicks

26:55.342 --> 26:57.347
[SPEAKER_03]: and basically it's a puzzle game.

26:58.289 --> 27:04.143
[SPEAKER_03]: The only reason I really bring this up, it seems like puzzle games are the big craze right now on the handheld systems.

27:05.035 --> 27:07.417
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it all because of Luminous or what's going on?

27:07.677 --> 27:10.439
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all systems, especially the DS.

27:10.739 --> 27:11.380
[SPEAKER_02]: All puzzle games.

27:11.880 --> 27:18.725
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny though, try to find a puzzle game that's not on a handheld system that's brand new coming out.

27:19.186 --> 27:20.306
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to find one.

27:21.047 --> 27:21.507
[SPEAKER_02]: At all.

27:21.728 --> 27:23.249
[SPEAKER_03]: On the consoles.

27:23.329 --> 27:25.430
[SPEAKER_03]: Puzzles seem to be big on the handheld now.

27:25.791 --> 27:29.753
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because you can play with other people.

27:30.194 --> 27:33.997
[SPEAKER_01]: The DS itself lends itself very well to the puzzle game

27:34.898 --> 27:35.298
[SPEAKER_01]: Puyo Puyo

28:03.118 --> 28:05.161
[SPEAKER_03]: There's something about having the puzzles on the console.

28:05.181 --> 28:07.644
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just imagine having something like Luminous on the console.

28:07.664 --> 28:08.525
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be so pretty.

28:09.225 --> 28:09.946
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

28:10.147 --> 28:10.807
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's just me.

28:11.188 --> 28:12.630
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can play on the internet and everything.

28:13.471 --> 28:13.711
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh well.

28:14.591 --> 28:20.156
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, lastly tonight, we just have a barrage of stories regarding video game movies.

28:20.236 --> 28:23.439
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's just an utter barrage of stuff going on.

28:24.119 --> 28:31.225
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, Hitman is going to be coming to the screen, and Vin Diesel, I believe you actually posted a story on OrangeSenseRadio.com about this.

28:31.245 --> 28:32.646
[SPEAKER_02]: Vin Diesel is playing Hitman.

28:33.147 --> 28:33.948
[SPEAKER_03]: Joy.

28:34.408 --> 28:36.750
[SPEAKER_03]: Should be interesting, certainly.

28:36.770 --> 28:38.752
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got to do something with what's left of his career.

28:40.130 --> 28:42.872
[SPEAKER_03]: Resident Evil is going to be having some more movies coming out.

28:42.912 --> 28:45.873
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be third and fourth movies.

28:46.234 --> 28:49.615
[SPEAKER_03]: The third movie, by the way, is called Resident Evil Afterlife.

28:50.276 --> 28:54.038
[SPEAKER_03]: And the movie script was written by the original director, Paul Anderson.

28:54.858 --> 28:59.300
[SPEAKER_03]: However, he is not currently attached to direct the upcoming film.

28:59.841 --> 29:04.363
[SPEAKER_03]: Mila Jovovich, though, is expected to come back and reprise her role tentatively 2006 for Resident Evil 3.

29:06.129 --> 29:09.552
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen the second one, but I heard that it kind of went really crazy.

29:10.313 --> 29:13.095
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard it wasn't so hot, but I don't really know.

29:13.135 --> 29:14.256
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't follow the games enough.

29:14.977 --> 29:17.599
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, I don't follow the games enough, for one.

29:17.639 --> 29:18.359
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're okay.

29:18.439 --> 29:21.262
[SPEAKER_03]: I play them, but I'm more into Silent Hill than I am Resident Evil.

29:21.282 --> 29:26.006
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one followed very... I think could have easily fit in with the whole...

29:27.165 --> 29:27.385
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

29:49.367 --> 29:53.988
[SPEAKER_03]: Dead or Alive is coming to the big screen.

29:54.768 --> 29:57.189
[SPEAKER_03]: Dead or Alive is being budgeted at $30 million.

29:57.949 --> 30:05.231
[SPEAKER_03]: It's being directed by Hong Kong action film director Corey Yuen, who did Romeo Must Die, which I thought was a very cool movie.

30:05.271 --> 30:09.512
[SPEAKER_03]: Producing the movie, Jeremy Bolt, who of course is also tied to the Resident Evil films.

30:09.892 --> 30:11.932
[SPEAKER_03]: The movie's script is being written by J.F.

30:12.112 --> 30:14.473
[SPEAKER_03]: Lawton, who did Pretty Woman, of all things.

30:14.873 --> 30:42.447
[SPEAKER_02]: and Seth Gross who did Devour which is an upcoming movie but what we should mention I do want to mention this Kasumi being played by Devon Aoki who was Miho in Sin City Miho and also for those who may not have seen Sin City she was also I believe Kiki which was the hot Asian driver that was in Too Fast Too Furious Suki Suki Kiki Suki who's got Hayabusa

30:43.726 --> 30:51.020
[SPEAKER_03]: They haven't talked about... Actually, it's Kane Kosugi, who is in Godzilla Final Wars, will be Ryu Hayabusa.

30:51.241 --> 30:51.541
[SPEAKER_02]: Ryu.

30:51.862 --> 30:52.083
[SPEAKER_03]: Ryu.

30:52.103 --> 30:52.704
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, whoop, Ryu.

30:53.288 --> 30:54.749
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my bad pronunciation coming in again.

30:54.769 --> 31:04.712
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, okay, well, we've got... I was looking earlier at the people playing... Let me name some more here because I have a bunch here.

31:05.052 --> 31:08.133
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie Presley from Not Another Teen Movie is Tina.

31:08.713 --> 31:12.074
[SPEAKER_03]: Nastassja Malth from Elektra is Ayan.

31:12.475 --> 31:15.576
[SPEAKER_03]: Sarah Carter from Final Destination 2 is Helena.

31:16.236 --> 31:19.257
[SPEAKER_03]: And Australian pop star Holly Valance is...

31:19.685 --> 31:20.405
[SPEAKER_03]: is Christy.

31:20.485 --> 31:22.946
[SPEAKER_03]: She was also in National Lampoon's Pledge This.

31:24.087 --> 31:26.808
[SPEAKER_03]: Professional wrestler Kevin Nash is bass.

31:27.268 --> 31:28.169
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God.

31:28.549 --> 31:32.230
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the thing is, though, is that in the game, though, he looks like Hulk Hogan.

31:33.311 --> 31:35.251
[SPEAKER_01]: But that kind of makes sense.

31:35.652 --> 31:41.574
[SPEAKER_03]: And Brian J. White, who, by the way, is also coming up in a film adaptation of Tekken, is going to be Zack.

31:41.734 --> 31:44.055
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even know they were doing a film adaptation of Tekken.

31:44.455 --> 31:46.176
[SPEAKER_01]: They better have somebody hot playing Gene.

31:48.464 --> 31:50.045
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I gotta look at the Tekken news.

31:54.268 --> 31:57.210
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man, all I gotta say is they got one hot cast.

31:57.510 --> 31:58.911
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to see this.

31:59.271 --> 32:01.293
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin Nash is in it.

32:01.533 --> 32:02.914
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan's gonna flip.

32:03.194 --> 32:04.995
[SPEAKER_02]: Brian J. White playing Bruce.

32:05.035 --> 32:06.316
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all they've got so far.

32:08.091 --> 32:09.392
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin Nash, wow.

32:10.153 --> 32:13.795
[SPEAKER_01]: He was Diesel back in the WCW days.

32:13.955 --> 32:23.781
[SPEAKER_02]: Tekken is being directed by Charles Stone III, written by Michael Cullery and Mike Werb, whoever the hell those people are.

32:24.041 --> 32:28.124
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on video game movie overload, but I saved the best for last, boys and girls.

32:28.884 --> 32:31.546
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me give you an idea of who Mike Werb is.

32:31.626 --> 32:35.608
[SPEAKER_02]: He did writing on Lara Croft, Tomb Raider, and Face Off.

32:35.929 --> 32:37.570
[SPEAKER_02]: Face Off was a good movie.

32:38.770 --> 32:47.777
[SPEAKER_02]: and also Michael did also writing on Lara Croft, Tomb Raider, and Face Off as well.

32:47.837 --> 32:49.198
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of neat.

32:49.239 --> 32:55.544
[SPEAKER_02]: Director Charles Stone III did Mr. 3000, Drumline, and Paid in Full.

32:56.825 --> 32:58.025
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just stuff we've never heard of.

32:58.966 --> 33:00.648
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I saved the best for last.

33:00.688 --> 33:01.088
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, guys.

33:01.448 --> 33:02.009
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the best.

33:03.693 --> 33:06.434
[SPEAKER_03]: They're making a movie out of the game Postal.

33:06.995 --> 33:11.518
[SPEAKER_03]: Postal, you remember the very controversial game where, let's see, what's their tagline?

33:11.978 --> 33:16.641
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, I don't know, basically it was just kill people in all the great ways you can.

33:17.082 --> 33:19.183
[SPEAKER_03]: The director who's attached to the Postal movie?

33:19.764 --> 33:20.204
[SPEAKER_03]: Uwe Boll.

33:23.314 --> 33:29.705
[SPEAKER_01]: I just saw the most... Why do they keep giving that man work?

33:29.945 --> 33:37.858
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, all he's doing is, I'm going to snatch up all the movie rights possible and make crap and keep churning it out over and over.

33:38.599 --> 33:42.080
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, people, have they watched these movies that have been made?

33:42.781 --> 33:43.981
[SPEAKER_02]: Save your dignity.

33:44.001 --> 33:49.763
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but keep in mind, half of Hollywood's on drugs, and the other half is, you know, lung liquor.

33:49.783 --> 34:01.107
[SPEAKER_03]: This movie game, Uwe Boll, by the way, for those who may not know, famous for his work on the films Alone in the Dark, House of the Dead, and the upcoming Blood Rain.

34:02.699 --> 34:04.321
[SPEAKER_02]: House of the Dead was funny

34:25.339 --> 34:25.920
[SPEAKER_03]: Far Cry

34:42.620 --> 34:46.282
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the career video game movie maker, boys and girls.

34:46.642 --> 34:48.002
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, you know what?

34:48.363 --> 34:51.644
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember back in the day when I thought Mortal Kombat, the movie, kind of sucked.

34:51.764 --> 34:52.925
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Mortal Kombat Annihilation.

34:52.945 --> 34:54.725
[SPEAKER_02]: It's starting to look pretty good right now, isn't it?

34:54.805 --> 34:56.446
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

34:56.466 --> 35:00.488
[SPEAKER_01]: Mortal Kombat Annihilation is an hour and a half of my life that I really want back.

35:00.608 --> 35:03.249
[SPEAKER_01]: Suddenly that Final Fantasy movie wasn't so bad, was it?

35:03.269 --> 35:04.870
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the Final Fantasy movie was good.

35:05.610 --> 35:07.492
[SPEAKER_01]: But it wasn't Final Fantasy.

35:08.132 --> 35:09.814
[SPEAKER_01]: But as a movie, it was good.

35:09.834 --> 35:11.495
[SPEAKER_03]: It should have been Alien 5.

35:11.555 --> 35:13.017
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's what it's got to come up with, though.

35:13.037 --> 35:15.078
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Rob, it's like this.

35:15.699 --> 35:23.105
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you've got a movie coming out this fall, Doom, starring The Rock or whatever.

35:23.886 --> 35:26.028
[SPEAKER_02]: This has the potential to be pretty good.

35:26.108 --> 35:27.269
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that and the Halo movie.

35:27.728 --> 35:30.170
[SPEAKER_02]: What we need is good video game movies to come out.

35:30.250 --> 35:33.111
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I am so not interested in a Halo movie.

35:33.632 --> 35:36.834
[SPEAKER_03]: Love the game, I just, I know that a movie will ruin it.

35:36.994 --> 35:38.375
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not interested in the movie.

35:38.395 --> 35:39.155
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, okay, well fine, fine.

35:39.175 --> 35:40.676
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe not that, but like Spy Hunter.

35:40.836 --> 35:42.817
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, these movies, they'll be okay.

35:42.897 --> 35:45.799
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be, they could be good, okay?

35:45.839 --> 35:46.440
[SPEAKER_03]: Could be.

35:46.620 --> 35:46.960
[SPEAKER_03]: Could be.

35:47.000 --> 35:47.680
[SPEAKER_03]: Could be.

35:47.760 --> 35:49.221
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big if.

35:49.301 --> 35:51.263
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, assuming Doom is good, okay?

35:51.603 --> 35:53.204
[SPEAKER_02]: Assuming the Doom movie is good.

35:54.164 --> 36:00.227
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully people will say, okay, this is what they could be and not let Ui Bol direct anything ever again.

36:00.287 --> 36:04.229
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, Ui Bol should be... I want to put a hit out on Ui Bol.

36:04.269 --> 36:05.029
[SPEAKER_01]: No, stop.

36:05.929 --> 36:08.030
[SPEAKER_01]: This is downloadable by anybody on the internet.

36:08.050 --> 36:08.571
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go there.

36:08.591 --> 36:11.712
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to do a movie version of Hell and have Dennis Hopper in it.

36:12.292 --> 36:12.773
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

36:13.273 --> 36:15.674
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, you know Land of the Dead's coming out and he's in it.

36:17.799 --> 36:21.142
[SPEAKER_02]: Movie Bowl is like the video game version of M. Night Shyamalan.

36:21.162 --> 36:24.365
[SPEAKER_01]: He was just like, Hey, don't insult M. Night Shyamalan.

36:24.405 --> 36:25.326
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't insult him.

36:25.586 --> 36:26.007
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

36:26.407 --> 36:28.469
[SPEAKER_03]: So what if the ending of Signs was crap?

36:28.529 --> 36:29.350
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen Signs.

36:29.370 --> 36:31.492
[SPEAKER_03]: The Village was pretty good.

36:31.532 --> 36:32.333
[SPEAKER_03]: Signs was not crap.

36:32.353 --> 36:33.814
[SPEAKER_03]: The Village was retarded.

36:33.894 --> 36:34.775
[SPEAKER_03]: I like The Village.

36:34.815 --> 36:35.596
[SPEAKER_01]: The Village was...

36:36.136 --> 36:37.357
[SPEAKER_01]: An intelligent movie.

36:37.497 --> 36:38.677
[SPEAKER_03]: I like The Village, you should.

36:38.837 --> 36:39.938
[SPEAKER_01]: It required thought.

36:40.198 --> 36:40.578
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.

36:40.618 --> 36:44.100
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't figure out what the plot twist was going to be about five minutes into the movie.

36:44.120 --> 36:46.861
[SPEAKER_03]: Suddenly, Orange Lounge Radio has turned into the movie poop shoot.

36:46.961 --> 36:47.341
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

36:47.481 --> 36:49.502
[SPEAKER_03]: Movie poop shoot to go.

36:50.943 --> 36:55.485
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's time to end this episode so we can go beat up Loki.

36:55.525 --> 36:56.045
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that sound?

36:56.485 --> 36:57.366
[SPEAKER_01]: I drive over him in my car.

36:57.386 --> 37:00.067
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, you know about that movie, The Village?

37:00.307 --> 37:00.467
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

37:00.707 --> 37:02.168
[SPEAKER_02]: It was set in modern time.

37:05.615 --> 37:06.996
[SPEAKER_02]: and the aliens in Signs.

37:07.677 --> 37:08.717
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut up, I haven't seen it.

37:08.998 --> 37:09.978
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut up, I haven't seen it.

37:10.419 --> 37:10.839
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

37:12.841 --> 37:15.443
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio To Go.

37:15.563 --> 37:16.503
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for listening.

37:16.564 --> 37:17.224
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good night.

37:19.146 --> 37:22.748
