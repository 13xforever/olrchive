awesome co-host dark Sakura Jamie Summers dust dust dust dirt and cat poo

00:49.280 --> 00:55.720
how very random what's on your mind I've been moving and changing cat litter fun

00:55.720 --> 01:00.560
Oh my life is a never-ending swirl of dust. I feel like I'm in Kansas

01:00.560 --> 01:03.560
I thought maybe you were finding cat poo in very hideous places

01:04.560 --> 01:07.680
That would be a cat who would be in a lot of trouble. All right

01:08.400 --> 01:15.120
I'll start joining us the one and only infamous Loki. I'll take the contents of my wallet for 500 Alex

01:16.360 --> 01:18.560
No, all right anyways

01:19.200 --> 01:23.800
How you doing? I'm hungry. I mean I haven't eaten since 2 p.m.

01:23.800 --> 01:29.080
and it's now like what seven hours later well you could have some damn I don't

01:29.080 --> 01:32.840
want any damn damn by the way is the candy I got at IKEA that looks like

01:32.840 --> 01:36.120
Heath bars it's kind of been a running gag all night long on our three hour

01:36.120 --> 01:39.520
program that we do on Sunday nights via orange launch radio.com they would know

01:39.520 --> 01:43.560
that if they were listening so I've been I've been you know passing my time by

01:43.560 --> 01:50.120
you know grading sedans grading sedans grading sedans how so like cheese oh I

01:50.120 --> 01:56.540
I know what you're talking about because I great SUVs the one and only warioware twisted. I just have nerves that get graded. I

01:57.060 --> 02:03.220
Also found that there's one game in there. That's completely easy to play and you can get like infinite levels on

02:04.460 --> 02:07.200
Because it requires you to do nothing

02:08.060 --> 02:10.060
It's awesome

02:10.760 --> 02:12.760
Anyways

02:12.800 --> 02:17.560
All right, well, let's get to the games that you've been playing this week because we always do this every week

02:17.560 --> 02:22.980
Just kind of give you a pulse on what real gamers at least I think that's what we were considered are up to so let's

02:22.980 --> 02:27.220
Start with Dark Sakura. What do you blame mind games with my fiancee? I mean

02:28.340 --> 02:34.660
That's just required part of being engaged to a guy. I haven't really had a lot of time to play any games

02:35.260 --> 02:42.140
Except I did play some PSO this week. I had forgotten I did play some PSO. Well, I thought blue burst beta closed

02:42.140 --> 02:44.140
Are you talking about Xbox paying? Oh

02:44.140 --> 02:49.980
Oh, it's a bloopers. There was no I thought there was gonna be a gap between oh it went live. Hey cool

02:50.100 --> 02:56.620
So I've had paid on Monday and played on Wednesday his bloopers gonna be sold over the counter over the counter

02:56.620 --> 03:00.420
I think download it's only download think it's only download. That's kind of interesting

03:01.020 --> 03:05.140
Different way of marketing I guess. Oh, yeah, and it's only like nine dollars a month. So it's really cheap

03:05.140 --> 03:07.680
That's how puzzle pirates started to though is only download. So

03:08.820 --> 03:12.360
Interesting, excuse me. That's all right. Sometimes that real life stuff gets in the way

03:12.360 --> 03:13.860
um

03:13.860 --> 03:16.760
Dan's been playing a lot of initial D ever since I got my car

03:17.560 --> 03:22.300
For those who don't know I have a 2002 Mitsubishi Lancer OZ rally now

03:22.300 --> 03:26.820
He's talking about getting an evolution. So he's been going crazy on initial D on ps2

03:27.640 --> 03:28.940
making

03:28.940 --> 03:33.700
Evolutions he's playing an evo 7 right now. So I can imagine you are probably sick of eurobeat at this point

03:33.700 --> 03:38.340
I can you're a beat and he comes in my car and drives it and makes me listen to eurobeat

03:38.340 --> 03:44.240
I'm like no no no he doesn't realize he does realize that your Lancer is not initial D, right?

03:44.960 --> 03:50.800
He got challenged to a race though. I got challenged to a race. I'm like turn

03:52.840 --> 03:55.460
My mic I have a 2.0. There's no way

03:56.120 --> 04:02.260
Alright, Loki would have smoked the little piece of crap civic hybrid that was challenging me

04:03.000 --> 04:05.600
Why why do people do that seriously get a life?

04:05.600 --> 04:08.600
Loki, what have you been up to game wise?

04:08.600 --> 04:15.600
The reason why they do that is because they see movies like Too Fast Too Furious and Fast and the Furious and the Insert Racing movie here.

04:15.600 --> 04:19.600
That's because they're stupid.

04:19.600 --> 04:22.600
Anyways, I've been playing Wario War Twisted today.

04:22.600 --> 04:28.600
I'm trying to unlock all the wonderful goodies there and there's tons to unlock.

04:28.600 --> 04:40.600
to unlock. So I just keep playing. And then also I've been playing Grand Theft Auto San Andreas for the PC. And the graphics are much better in that. And plus all the mods you can do to it are a lot of fun.

04:40.600 --> 04:50.600
So I've been passing my time. But the controls, the only thing that pisses me off is the camera doesn't change with you when you turn in the PC version. So you have to adjust the camera with the mouse at the same time.

04:50.600 --> 04:55.600
time it's not very convenient for me so I need to find a way to get it to move

04:55.600 --> 05:00.520
the camera with it or something so I can actually play the game other than that

05:00.520 --> 05:05.680
Did you try the special mod? I haven't gotten to that yeah I tried to take her out on a date

05:05.680 --> 05:09.880
and she wanted to um you know do a drive-by because that's what you do on

05:09.880 --> 05:15.840
dates in Los Santos I guess and so I did some I thought that sex mod was a load

05:15.840 --> 05:21.540
of crap. No. No. No. Oh. I showed you the stuff from that one. I thought it was shown

05:21.540 --> 05:26.880
to be a photoshop or something. No. It was real. I have video. I have video of it. It's

05:26.880 --> 05:32.640
not a photoshop. Weird. Alright. Alright. Well, in other news also. It doesn't surprise

05:32.640 --> 05:37.920
me, sadly. In other news, that mod, they've made it for the Playstation 2 and Xbox versions

05:37.920 --> 05:43.340
of the game. You can get patches for it. Anyways. People will see their boobies no matter what

05:43.340 --> 05:49.180
it takes well huh I guess people want boobies that's what it takes anyways um

05:49.180 --> 05:54.340
so yeah I've been playing that today I what did I do in the game today today I

05:54.340 --> 06:01.060
had an army of I put in the slut magnet code and that is the literal thing what

06:01.060 --> 06:04.980
happens is it's basically like a theme you have an army of sluts carrying

06:04.980 --> 06:09.900
dildos and vibrators and they are chasing after you meanwhile you are in a

06:09.900 --> 06:17.580
gimp outfit with a dildo and yeah I was killing people with the dildo oh and I

06:17.580 --> 06:22.180
went through and I adjusted the damage rates for each weapon stuff so my

06:22.180 --> 06:26.380
spray-paint was like is like pure anthrax or something because it was

06:26.380 --> 06:30.820
instant death for everything that you know basically touched it it was a lot

06:30.820 --> 06:40.180
of fun yeah and we wonder why parents complain about these games I whatever

06:40.180 --> 06:44.860
yeah the finish how that date went my car ended up getting shot up and then

06:44.860 --> 06:49.500
exploded and then that was the end of that dance that's that's a nice story

06:49.500 --> 06:56.220
they could only be told in Grand Theft Auto anything else I believe that's all

06:56.220 --> 06:59.720
the games I played this week oh no I actually did try playing some of the

06:59.720 --> 07:04.200
emulators. I played a little bit Doom on my PSP. Well you gotta tell us about this

07:04.200 --> 07:07.800
a little bit, the PSP stuff. That was big news this week. Real quick, I'll tell you

07:07.800 --> 07:10.080
about mine, because I actually didn't get a chance to play a whole lot of new

07:10.080 --> 07:13.320
games. I've still been playing WarioWare Twisted. I only really touched the

07:13.320 --> 07:17.040
surface of it. Now I'm really into the game. I'm just trying to unlock more

07:17.040 --> 07:22.520
souvenirs. I gotta say, WarioWare graphics, typically what you're used to in WarioWare.

07:22.520 --> 07:27.000
Sound is, you know, again what you'd be used to. Bleeps and bloops, nothing too

07:27.000 --> 07:31.260
exciting except there are records that you can unlock which is kind of cool

07:31.260 --> 07:35.720
because you can unlock like the old Kid Icarus theme as a record and by the way

07:35.720 --> 07:40.120
a big F you to Nintendo because the little caption that shows up when you

07:40.120 --> 07:43.760
unlock the Kid Icarus record is it says this is the closest thing to a sequel

07:43.760 --> 07:47.760
you're gonna get hahaha and I'm like past hurts you need to do a Kid Icarus

07:47.760 --> 07:53.380
sequel but you can get records then you can scratch it using like the twist you

07:53.380 --> 07:55.800
know because the whole concept of Oriortress is that you move the thing

07:55.800 --> 07:59.320
around so it's kind of cool so it's a lot of fun I I'm surprised warrior wear

07:59.320 --> 08:03.400
twisted looked kind of dumb to me and I was not a big fan of the twist idea but

08:03.400 --> 08:06.960
just goes to show you got to actually sit down and play the game because I'm

08:06.960 --> 08:10.640
having a lot of fun with it I actually really like the twist concept it's a lot

08:10.640 --> 08:14.820
of fun so I'm having fun with the game I definitely recommend it I want to pet

08:14.820 --> 08:19.040
the kitty I that was the coolest unlock that you have Loki I don't have this one

08:19.040 --> 08:23.400
yet but the mute roid or whatever with the cat with a gun that rolls around on

08:23.400 --> 08:27.100
its back and shoots things. No, I don't want to do the pet, the kitty. They have a lot of...

08:27.100 --> 08:31.440
Well, that was cute, but I want to shoot things with the kitty. We need Nintendcats.

08:31.440 --> 08:35.400
They have some other fun stuff in there, like you can unlock a mini golf,

08:35.400 --> 08:38.880
like a mini golf game, you can unlock a batting practice game,

08:38.880 --> 08:43.320
you can unlock a ton of stuff. I love the mini games that are tucked away in there and I

08:43.320 --> 08:45.040
think that's where Twisted is really

08:45.040 --> 08:48.400
excelling over Touched because the mini games in Touched were kinda

08:48.400 --> 08:51.440
eh, which is too bad because Touched, you know, it's got a...

08:51.440 --> 08:53.840
The stylus thing is such a cool idea.

08:53.840 --> 08:55.440
I'm surprised it wasn't utilized,

08:55.440 --> 08:57.240
but maybe the game was rushed, I don't know.

08:57.240 --> 08:58.400
Who knows, who knows?

08:59.420 --> 09:02.860
All right, Loki, some big game news this week.

09:02.860 --> 09:04.080
I'm gonna let you start off tonight

09:04.080 --> 09:06.280
because that PSP hacking is just,

09:06.280 --> 09:10.080
when I saw one of my friends playing Legend of Zelda

09:10.080 --> 09:12.020
on the PSP, I was just like,

09:12.020 --> 09:14.700
there is something really, really wrong with this picture,

09:14.700 --> 09:19.220
yet so satisfying as somebody who loves retro games.

09:19.220 --> 09:20.060
What happened, what's up?

09:20.060 --> 09:25.280
Basically, like I mentioned last week, the whole rumor that there was going to be a PSP

09:25.280 --> 09:32.600
homebrew on version 1.5 PSPs, well, it apparently was real, so, um, reality, basically the way

09:32.600 --> 09:38.120
it works is it's a swap trick, kind of a throwback to the old PlayStation swap trick, basically

09:38.120 --> 09:43.480
you load, you form, basically you have two memory cards, and one of them, it can be any

09:43.480 --> 09:47.880
memory card size, you know, basically you put a small little file on there in a directory,

09:47.880 --> 09:51.800
And you put that same directory on another memory card.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.740
The second memory card is the one that actually has the program on it.

09:54.740 --> 09:59.580
So you put the first memory card in and you load up the program and while it's loading

09:59.580 --> 10:04.520
you really quickly swap in the one that has the actual program on it and then it runs

10:04.520 --> 10:05.880
the game.

10:05.880 --> 10:09.680
And so far they've gotten tons of stuff for it because all that same week you have Doom

10:09.680 --> 10:10.680
coming out.

10:10.680 --> 10:17.860
They ported the PC version of Doom to the PSP as well as your emulators and this game

10:17.860 --> 10:21.240
called Beats of Rage and just a bunch of homebrew stuff.

10:21.240 --> 10:26.480
So you can actually play Super Nintendo games on it, emulations a little bit slow still

10:26.480 --> 10:27.840
but you know they're working on it.

10:27.840 --> 10:33.920
You can actually use the program to overclock your PSP to what it's supposed to run at,

10:33.920 --> 10:35.640
333MHz.

10:35.640 --> 10:39.880
And you know it's pretty cool Nintendo stuff, I haven't gotten the Nintendo emulator to

10:39.880 --> 10:45.800
work on mine, I gotta try it again, but I mean it looked like it runs games pretty full

10:45.800 --> 10:46.800
speed.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.800
I actually saw it on one of my friend's PSPs and it looked great.

10:48.800 --> 10:49.800
I was impressed.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.400
It was just, wow.

10:51.400 --> 10:56.080
Even though these games we've played to death, there's just something about having that whole

10:56.080 --> 11:02.920
catalog of games opened up, able to play on the go, on a nice looking screen that is just

11:02.920 --> 11:04.000
so neat to me.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
I don't know.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.560
It makes me want a PSP even more.

11:06.560 --> 11:09.760
Right now I was kind of like, eh, yeah, I want a PSP, but what do I really want it for?

11:09.760 --> 11:12.920
I want to play Luminous and whatever cool games they release in the future.

11:12.920 --> 11:17.680
But now I'm like, oh wow, with this trick I can play the old Nintendo catalog and who

11:17.680 --> 11:18.680
knows what else.

11:18.680 --> 11:19.680
For now?

11:19.680 --> 11:23.520
Yeah, for now until they, when's this story going to come to an end here?

11:23.520 --> 11:30.960
Well, they've announced already that you can upgrade your system to a version 1.52 over,

11:30.960 --> 11:33.560
you can do a network update, that type of thing.

11:33.560 --> 11:36.400
But who's going to do that because it'll stop you from playing it.

11:36.400 --> 11:50.400
However, in Japan, the same type of thing is happening with the version 1.0 stuff, where they'll upgrade yours to 1.52 by playing certain games, and they'll have a firmware update on the actual game, and they'll force you to update it in order to play that game.

11:50.400 --> 11:58.400
So, it kinda sucks, but there are ways around it still, and people are gonna find ways around that too. I mean, you just watch, so...

11:58.400 --> 12:04.440
It's right now. I just enjoy it while you have it. I mean and avoid those games that'll force it updates

12:04.440 --> 12:07.720
So that's pretty much it. Yeah, okay

12:08.720 --> 12:12.720
Anything else you want to share really quickly what's going on in the hacking and cracking world or anything?

12:12.720 --> 12:16.880
I imagine that's probably the biggest thing. It's got everybody's attention right now. That's the biggest thing right now

12:16.880 --> 12:20.460
they've got um, the heretic wad works with the

12:21.120 --> 12:26.740
Doom thing but the second thing that actually was just released not too long ago. It's probably within the hour

12:26.740 --> 12:36.740
was the PSP personalized version 1.0 and basically what that does is you know how the PSP has the wonderful graphics in the background that changes color with the month?

12:36.740 --> 12:40.740
Well now you can import your own graphics into it using this program.

12:40.740 --> 12:42.740
That's kind of cool.

12:42.740 --> 12:47.740
So that's kind of neat. I mean those people, everyone likes to customize their PSPs so this is another way to do it.

12:47.740 --> 12:50.740
You can make your PSP as ugly as your MySpace page if you want.

12:50.740 --> 12:58.740
Exactly, and so they have that available right now as well as, let's see here, weather stuff they've got coming out.

12:58.740 --> 13:04.740
Someone else is working on a custom boot up screen video, you know how they have the little PSP screen boot up thing?

13:04.740 --> 13:09.740
Well now you'll be able to put your own video in there and that's something that's going to be coming yet again later on.

13:09.740 --> 13:16.740
And also there is more information released about Liberty City Stories, the Grand Theft Auto version that's going to be coming out.

13:16.740 --> 13:22.340
basically just the same stuff we already know there's not going to be aircraft in

13:22.340 --> 13:26.260
it the main character Tony is gonna be voiced by Michael Madsen which is kind

13:26.260 --> 13:31.940
of cool the graphics will be better than Grand Theft Auto 3 new landmarks are

13:31.940 --> 13:36.220
going to be available in Liberty City this time the motorcycles will be in

13:36.220 --> 13:40.140
there as well because you know you can ride motorcycles and story will be as

13:40.140 --> 13:44.300
long as Vice City that's not hacking crack news you snuck that in there just

13:44.300 --> 13:51.300
Yeah, I like that stuff. Anyways, Genesis emulator was released for it, so that's kind of neat.

13:51.300 --> 14:02.300
And other than that, check out PSPhacker.com, it's a good resource for finding all your homebrew stuff as far as all the brand new releases for the emulators and whatnot.

14:02.300 --> 14:05.300
For those of you guys that are going crazy over the PSP news this week.

14:05.300 --> 14:09.380
Yeah, PSPhacker.com and they also have their sister site which is

14:09.380 --> 14:13.660
dshacker.com but obviously not as much news going on over there.

14:13.660 --> 14:17.780
Alright, well let's get to some gaming news what's going on this week.

14:17.780 --> 14:21.680
First off, a story about the Matrix Online. This is a game you played for

14:21.680 --> 14:22.980
what about a week, Loki, or what?

14:22.980 --> 14:26.900
A week, I got tired of it. Well, something may change here soon because Matrix

14:26.900 --> 14:30.260
Online is rumored to be sold to Sony

14:30.260 --> 14:35.240
Online Entertainment. More developments to come, I'm not sure if this was

14:35.240 --> 14:38.840
finalized or what but it's pretty strong rumor here that the matrix online is

14:38.840 --> 14:43.680
being sold over to Sony online entertainment yeah most of monoliths

14:43.680 --> 14:48.040
employees are being laid off and so monolith is getting out of the online

14:48.040 --> 14:51.800
game business that's why it's being sold what do you think good news bad news I

14:51.800 --> 14:56.120
don't care news I'm impartial to it it doesn't really matter

14:56.120 --> 15:00.680
did matrix online because part of the whole play online lineup because all

15:00.680 --> 15:04.640
they have are what two games well I don't necessarily becomes play online

15:04.640 --> 15:08.620
because EverQuest is also Sony and it's not a part of Play Online and if I

15:08.620 --> 15:12.480
remember I Play Online is specifically Half Square as well. That's true. Square

15:12.480 --> 15:16.720
has nothing to do with this. Square doesn't just have Final Fantasy 11, they have Wolfie, Cal and Tetra

15:16.720 --> 15:20.000
Master, but they also have Front Mission Online, their other online game that's

15:20.000 --> 15:22.960
gonna be coming out. And they have a Mahjong game in Japan I believe. Yeah. From what I

15:22.960 --> 15:26.920
remember. Yeah. Dude, I would do Front Mission Online. That would be fun. Coming out for

15:26.920 --> 15:31.160
consoles. So that should just be interesting. You know, Matrix Online, even though we

15:31.160 --> 15:33.760
haven't really played it a whole lot and haven't been able to give you a lot of

15:33.760 --> 15:37.380
perspective. I kind of think it's neat, some of their ideas, that they have the

15:37.380 --> 15:41.360
actual actors playing in the game. It's kind of neat, I guess. It's different. I

15:41.360 --> 15:45.400
can applaud a company that takes different ideas on MMOs and games, so

15:45.400 --> 15:51.440
whatever. That's cool. Let's move on to another story that is just too cool for

15:51.440 --> 15:56.940
words. I'm so excited about this. This website here, a blogger, I should say

15:56.940 --> 16:02.240
pressthebuttons.com is reporting that the Super Mario Brothers Super Show is

16:02.240 --> 16:05.480
is going to be released on DVD.

16:05.480 --> 16:09.960
A complete series of the programs are going to be released on DVD. This would

16:09.960 --> 16:12.080
include all the Mario cartoons

16:12.080 --> 16:15.440
and the Zelda cartoons to be released this October.

16:15.440 --> 16:19.600
This has been done before, but with only some episodes.

16:19.600 --> 16:23.760
Right, it was like a best of. So the best of has happened previously, but I suppose

16:23.760 --> 16:25.920
due to demand or torrents or whatever,

16:25.920 --> 16:30.280
they're gonna release the complete series. I am actually considering buying

16:30.280 --> 16:33.420
this because I have such fond memories of watching this when I was growing up I don't

16:33.420 --> 16:37.480
know I don't know about you guys out there but this show just I remember Friday Zelda

16:37.480 --> 16:43.940
cartoons well excuse me princess it was just cool any thoughts Loki something you'd consider

16:43.940 --> 16:48.720
buying or no I'm trying to find the story there's something that sort of reminded me

16:48.720 --> 16:56.600
of this actually there's some brand new site out there that has all of the old video game

16:56.600 --> 17:01.280
commercials uh-huh I've heard of that site yeah yeah so that was one I thought

17:01.280 --> 17:06.160
mentioned I was watching the Nintendo Entertainment cereal system Nintendo

17:06.160 --> 17:11.760
it's your breakfast commercial is awful and if you watch some of those episodes

17:11.760 --> 17:15.280
of Mario some of them were really awful but the Super Mario World ones are

17:15.280 --> 17:21.440
really good it's Captain Lou it's Mario I know but still it's like they made

17:21.440 --> 17:27.140
sound effects when they walked but I thought that was cute I don't know all

17:27.140 --> 17:31.660
right well are you thinking about buying this you own a ton of DVDs surely you

17:31.660 --> 17:36.060
have to add this one to your collection probably not I've been working on box

17:36.060 --> 17:41.740
sets of stuff I need to finish the samurai troopers set fine fine hate on

17:41.740 --> 17:44.840
Mario Brothers see if I said that I have all the episodes is old on my computer

17:44.840 --> 17:49.860
all right um moving on I just wanted to dress real fast if you guys ever have

17:49.860 --> 17:53.540
any comments or feedback on the show you can always send us an email to go at

17:53.540 --> 17:58.860
orange lounge radio.com is the address and the one only dark soccer likes to

17:58.860 --> 18:05.980
check that box once in a while and well but she's she's warm and friendly and

18:05.980 --> 18:11.820
when she checks that yeah you get the real me not the we've given shot who has

18:11.820 --> 18:15.820
been worn out by the week and has been moving boxes maybe I should check it

18:15.820 --> 18:21.660
this week maybe that's all right that's okay I do it at work anyway all right

18:21.660 --> 18:24.820
let's do a quick follow-up to a story we were talking about a couple weeks ago

18:24.820 --> 18:29.980
Sony is talking about those porno UMDs remember we were talking about a couple

18:29.980 --> 18:35.260
weeks ago they're gonna release pornos on the PSP well out of Tokyo Sony

18:35.260 --> 18:39.220
computer entertainment they are frowning at this whole thing calling this stuff

18:39.220 --> 18:44.640
quote utterly undesirable but we cannot stop software makers from selling such

18:44.640 --> 18:51.000
videos hmm an interesting thing to note software releases for the PSP they have

18:51.000 --> 18:55.160
to go through an approval process before they could be released however the

18:55.160 --> 18:59.560
movies on the UMDs do not have to go through an approval process this is the

18:59.560 --> 19:05.440
loophole that the porno games are going through so it kind of you know what game

19:05.440 --> 19:10.000
company is gonna come out and say great bring on the porn to our system so it's

19:10.000 --> 19:13.720
this is kind of obvious and you know what's gonna happen but any thoughts on

19:13.720 --> 19:19.360
the porno on the PSP they're gonna find a way anyway if it's not via UMD they're

19:19.360 --> 19:23.560
gonna put it on their memory stick might as well make a buck off it huh Final

19:23.560 --> 19:28.880
Fantasy 12 big news is coming from Squeenix they're gonna be doing a party

19:28.880 --> 19:33.040
over in Tokyo their summer gaming event it's the Square Enix party 2005 it

19:33.040 --> 19:39.560
happens July 30 and 31 at the Nippon Convention Center and what's gonna

19:39.560 --> 19:42.360
happen is that Nobuo Uematsu will actually be there and he'll be talking

19:42.360 --> 19:46.440
about the game and showing off some new footage they'll also be having some of

19:46.440 --> 19:50.520
the voice actors there as well the music supervisor will be there and they'll

19:50.520 --> 19:56.800
have more new information including some type of surprise you guys think you

19:56.800 --> 20:01.560
might know what any of the surprise any guesses what the big Final Fantasy 12

20:01.560 --> 20:06.600
surprise could be? You're on candid camera? Maybe Final Fantasy 5 is hidden in the

20:06.600 --> 20:13.560
game which was the best of them all I seriously after seeing the footage at e3

20:13.560 --> 20:17.480
the new Final Fantasy 12 trailer because they didn't really show any bits of the

20:17.480 --> 20:21.360
game they only showed the trailer I seriously think it has something to do

20:21.360 --> 20:27.880
with the next-gen system I prize it's cross-gen it's ps3 and ps2 I or I think

20:27.880 --> 20:32.520
maybe with the father is 11 it could be Xbox 360 now again I'm speculating but I

20:32.520 --> 20:38.020
I you know maybe it was cube maybe it was the ps2 but I I was just like dang

20:38.020 --> 20:42.840
this looks too good to be a system had a tech demo for Final Fantasy 7 oh yeah

20:42.840 --> 20:49.620
oh true true I I that I would that's my initial thought I bet it's something

20:49.620 --> 20:53.520
minor and who cares about it is probably just some in-game tactic or something I

20:53.520 --> 20:56.580
don't know or maybe one of the voice actors it's a really big name or the

20:56.580 --> 21:00.900
theme song or something but Al Pacino will play the main character just

21:00.900 --> 21:09.740
You know what though, keep in mind though, back in the day on the Nintendo 64, they did

21:09.740 --> 21:18.820
all the Final Fantasy 6 characters for a tech demo for the Nintendo 64, and then Square

21:18.820 --> 21:21.460
jumped into bed with Sony.

21:21.460 --> 21:22.460
That's true.

21:22.460 --> 21:24.860
And they've been fucking around ever since.

21:24.860 --> 21:27.640
Well am I wrong?

21:27.640 --> 21:31.520
Well now Microsoft's getting, you know, coming in and wanting to get their hands on it.

21:31.520 --> 21:36.920
And in the background your cheating heart plays on the jukebox.

21:36.920 --> 21:42.400
I don't know, I don't know, that's just some speculation, you know, and for the record

21:42.400 --> 21:47.840
I would love to find a ROM or something of that demo, because I know it exists.

21:47.840 --> 21:52.720
I've got the one for Robotech Crystal Dreams, playable.

21:52.720 --> 21:53.720
Very cool.

21:53.720 --> 21:55.080
We need more Robotech games.

21:55.080 --> 21:58.120
we'll see that's all we can really do here on the show speculator we're just

21:58.120 --> 22:01.840
gamers like the rest of you so I I think that would be kind of a neat news though

22:01.840 --> 22:07.480
if it is cross-gen but I think I I think I'm just crazy talk but if you have a

22:07.480 --> 22:12.200
suggestion send it to us that's okay we're used to it yeah whatever all right

22:12.200 --> 22:16.220
orange lounge radio we're not just here to talk about video games all the time

22:16.220 --> 22:19.460
but we're here to better your life because if we talked about games all the

22:19.460 --> 22:24.480
time and never went outside we'd have no time to take over the world so we are

22:24.480 --> 22:28.000
here to bring you some advice to better your life, and who better to bring it to you than

22:28.000 --> 22:32.040
the one and only, the huggable Dark Sakura with her advice column.

22:32.040 --> 22:34.040
Are you saying I'm cuddly?

22:34.040 --> 22:35.040
Yes I am.

22:35.040 --> 22:36.040
Damn it.

22:36.040 --> 22:42.440
Today's a bit of sage advice is how to treat a broken nose.

22:42.440 --> 22:45.040
Number one, stop the bleeding.

22:45.040 --> 22:46.040
Duh.

22:46.040 --> 22:47.880
Tilt your head back slightly.

22:47.880 --> 22:51.680
Pinch the bridge of your nose closed, the region just below the hard cartilage, not

22:51.680 --> 22:52.680
simply the nostrils.

22:52.680 --> 22:55.680
Hold a tissue underneath your nostrils to catch the blood.

22:55.680 --> 22:56.680
Icky.

22:56.680 --> 22:57.680
2.

22:57.680 --> 22:59.680
Apply a cold pack or ice immediately.

22:59.680 --> 23:00.680
Keep your head tilted back.

23:00.680 --> 23:03.680
Continue to apply ice as needed to keep the swelling down.

23:03.680 --> 23:04.680
3.

23:04.680 --> 23:08.680
If your nose appears broken or crooked, do not attempt to treat it yourself.

23:08.680 --> 23:13.680
The only reason to attempt to relocate the position of the nose is if you are having trouble breathing through your mouth.

23:13.680 --> 23:19.680
If you aren't getting any air, you can attempt to relocate the position of your nose so that you can breathe through it,

23:19.680 --> 23:21.680
but this will be quite painful.

23:21.680 --> 23:28.900
Otherwise leave it to the doctor for sick medical attention immediately, but my final final bit of advice on that one. Yes

23:29.420 --> 23:32.180
Don't go getting into the bar fights pissed on Miller Lite

23:35.300 --> 23:41.940
Some sage advice there. Thank you. You're welcome. I always give good advice. You do you do well once in a while

23:42.860 --> 23:48.940
Just kidding. You know, you never know you're gonna be stuck in Brazil crossing a piranha infested river. Okay, you

23:48.940 --> 23:50.940
You never know.

23:50.940 --> 23:52.940
I know, I was just doing that the other week.

23:52.940 --> 23:55.940
And when was the last time you jumped off the roof of the building?

23:55.940 --> 23:58.940
Okay. See?

23:58.940 --> 23:59.940
Alright, alright.

23:59.940 --> 24:04.940
And you know, I had to stop a runaway camel the other day and I would not have known how to not research it.

24:04.940 --> 24:07.940
Alright. My bad, I'm sorry.

24:07.940 --> 24:08.940
Alright then.

24:08.940 --> 24:10.940
Let's talk about Mega Man Legends.

24:10.940 --> 24:14.940
Now, Loki kind of brought this up briefly last week, but this is hitting the news wire now.

24:14.940 --> 24:20.940
Mega Man Legends 2 is coming to the PSP, and it's shipping on September 8th.

24:20.940 --> 24:21.940
They have an announce date.

24:21.940 --> 24:25.940
Oh, by the way, that's a Japan shipping date, not an American shipping date yet.

24:25.940 --> 24:27.940
Good, why don't they work out in Legends 3 while they're at it?

24:27.940 --> 24:31.940
Because I already finished the first two games, and I want more.

24:31.940 --> 24:40.940
Mega Man Legends is coming out on August 4th for the PSP Breath of Fire 3 on August 25th.

24:40.940 --> 24:43.940
Direct port to their PlayStation originals.

24:43.940 --> 24:47.520
But they will be reformatted to the widescreen thing go figure

24:48.280 --> 24:50.280
So all those games coming out in Japan

24:51.200 --> 24:52.880
Hopefully here, too

24:52.880 --> 24:58.760
We'll find out. I do believe that they also there's also a release date for papacros. I

24:59.540 --> 25:02.120
Haven't been following that. I do believe that they said August

25:02.640 --> 25:04.640
December September and

25:04.760 --> 25:09.520
New as a month difference very cool right there for those of you guys that like the music games, by the way

25:09.520 --> 25:14.800
We have some dates for DDR Extreme 2 and DDR Ultra Mix 3.

25:14.800 --> 25:23.400
DDR Extreme 2 is going to be out September the 28th with Extreme 2 on September the 28th

25:23.400 --> 25:29.000
and Ultra Mix 3, I get so confused, on November the 2nd are those games.

25:29.000 --> 25:34.320
But of course, subject to change as all shipping dates are.

25:34.320 --> 25:37.640
Miyamoto has been talking about Mario 128.

25:37.640 --> 25:39.960
You know that official sequel to Mario 64?

25:39.960 --> 25:43.480
I don't know what the hell Super Mario Sunshine was then, but I guess it wasn't an actual

25:43.480 --> 25:45.600
sequel.

25:45.600 --> 25:50.780
Mario 128 is the actual planned sequel, and he has officially said it ain't happening

25:50.780 --> 25:51.780
on GameCube.

25:51.780 --> 25:55.400
However, they will be doing it on Revolution.

25:55.400 --> 26:00.200
The Mario team can't create too many games at the same time, so they are concentrating

26:00.200 --> 26:03.120
on the Revolution.

26:03.120 --> 26:04.120
Any thoughts on that?

26:04.120 --> 26:10.680
some good stuff. I love Mario 64. I think Mario 64 is slightly overrated in the

26:10.680 --> 26:16.200
halls of video game history, but I think it's a fun game and I will certainly be

26:16.200 --> 26:20.160
all over a sequel. I think it could be good. Dan and I would play that game

26:20.160 --> 26:23.880
together every night for the first few months that I moved out here. What did

26:23.880 --> 26:27.640
you think of the DS one, though? Did you play that at all, or was the magic gone by that

26:27.640 --> 26:33.360
point? I was in school taking a bunch of classes that required a lot of attention,

26:33.360 --> 26:36.680
So, no, I didn't play it.

26:36.680 --> 26:41.040
Tecmo is going to be getting into the PSP world by doing their very first puzzle action

26:41.040 --> 26:42.040
handheld game.

26:42.040 --> 26:45.200
It's actually their first PSP release, I'm sorry, not necessarily their first puzzle

26:45.200 --> 26:49.240
action game, but it's going to be their first PSP release, and it is a puzzle action game,

26:49.240 --> 26:58.320
and it's called Karakuri, roughly translated to gimmicks, and basically it's a puzzle game.

26:58.320 --> 27:02.600
The only reason I really bring this up, it seems like puzzle games are the big craze

27:02.600 --> 27:07.240
right now on the handheld systems is it all because of luminous or what's going

27:07.240 --> 27:12.600
on it's all systems especially the DS all puzzle games it's funny though try

27:12.600 --> 27:18.080
to find a puzzle game mmm that's not on a handheld system that's brand-new

27:18.080 --> 27:22.680
coming out you're not gonna find one at all on the on the consoles yeah

27:22.680 --> 27:26.720
consoles puzzle seem to be big on the handheld now well that's because you

27:26.720 --> 27:32.560
know it's you can play with other people the DS itself lends itself very well

27:32.560 --> 27:37.720
well to the puzzle game genre, especially like with Pac-Pix lately.

27:37.720 --> 27:44.740
Pac-Pix is so unique, I need to pick that up, but you know, I've been playing at E3,

27:44.740 --> 27:48.400
every time I was in a line for something, out came Puyo Puyo.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.560
I'm addicted to Puyo Puyo.

27:50.560 --> 27:52.520
Okay, alright, makes sense.

27:52.520 --> 27:54.680
Ever since the days of Kirby's Avalanche.

27:54.680 --> 28:01.000
It does make sense in the fact that, you know, puzzles are portable and it's easy to just

28:01.000 --> 28:04.120
play for a few seconds and what have you but there's something about having the

28:04.120 --> 28:06.880
puzzles on the console I mean just imagine having something like luminous

28:06.880 --> 28:11.400
on the console could be so pretty I don't know maybe it's just me you can

28:11.400 --> 28:16.320
play on the internet and everything oh alright lastly tonight we just have a

28:16.320 --> 28:21.240
barrage of stories regarding video game movies I mean there's just an utter

28:21.240 --> 28:27.080
barrage of stuff going on first off hitman is gonna be coming to the screen

28:27.080 --> 28:31.120
and Vin Diesel. I believe you actually posted a story on orangeonsradio.com

28:31.120 --> 28:37.180
Vin Diesel is playing hitman. Joy. Should be interesting. Certainly. He's got to do

28:37.180 --> 28:41.760
something with what's left of his career. Resident Evil is gonna be having some

28:41.760 --> 28:46.960
more movies coming out. There will be third and fourth movies. The third movie

28:46.960 --> 28:51.320
by the way is called Resident Evil Afterlife and the movie script was

28:51.320 --> 28:56.680
written by the original director Paul Anderson. However, he is not currently

28:56.680 --> 29:01.520
attached to direct the upcoming film Mila Jovovich though is expected to come

29:01.520 --> 29:06.680
back and reprise her role tentatively 2006 for Resident Evil 3 I haven't seen

29:06.680 --> 29:10.920
the second one but I heard that it kind of went really crazy I heard it wasn't

29:10.920 --> 29:15.280
so hot but I don't really know I don't follow the games enough or I don't I

29:15.280 --> 29:18.260
well yeah I don't follow the games enough for one I mean they're okay I

29:18.260 --> 29:23.720
plan but I'm more into Silent Hill than the first one followed very I think

29:23.720 --> 29:30.460
could have easily fit in with the whole established storyline for the game, but the second one

29:30.460 --> 29:36.520
with bringing in, with changing up Jill and all that I think completely ruined their chances.

29:36.520 --> 29:39.760
It made the movie seem less a part of the franchise.

29:39.760 --> 29:40.760
Hmm.

29:40.760 --> 29:41.760
Yes.

29:41.760 --> 29:42.760
What?

29:42.760 --> 29:43.760
Continue.

29:43.760 --> 29:46.820
You want me to get to this story?

29:46.820 --> 29:48.760
I was gonna talk about this earlier.

29:48.760 --> 29:49.760
Alright.

29:49.760 --> 29:52.120
Dead or Alive is the next movie I wanted to mention.

29:52.120 --> 29:54.780
Dead or Alive is coming to the big screen.

29:54.780 --> 29:58.000
Dead or Alive is being budgeted at $30 million.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.760
It's being directed by Hong Kong action film director

30:00.760 --> 30:03.120
Corey Yuan, who did Romeo Must Die,

30:03.120 --> 30:04.320
which I thought was a very cool movie.

30:04.320 --> 30:05.300
That was a good movie.

30:05.300 --> 30:07.040
Producing the movie Jeremy Bolt,

30:07.040 --> 30:09.920
who of course is also tied to the Resident Evil films.

30:09.920 --> 30:12.760
The movie's script being written by J.F. Lawton,

30:12.760 --> 30:14.760
who did Pretty Woman, of all things,

30:14.760 --> 30:17.240
and Seth Gross, who did Devour,

30:17.240 --> 30:18.880
which is an upcoming movie.

30:18.880 --> 30:19.880
What we should mention.

30:19.880 --> 30:21.040
I do wanna mention this.

30:21.040 --> 30:27.780
Kasumi being played by Devon Aoki who was Miho in Sin City and also for those who may

30:27.780 --> 30:36.820
not have seen Sin City she was also I believe Kiki which was the hot Asian driver that was

30:36.820 --> 30:38.820
in Too Fast Too Furious.

30:38.820 --> 30:43.760
So who's got Hayabusa?

30:43.760 --> 30:49.780
They haven't talked about, actually it's Kane Kosugi who is in Godzilla Final Wars will

30:49.780 --> 30:51.260
will be Ryu Hayabusa.

30:51.260 --> 30:52.100
Ryu.

30:52.100 --> 30:53.340
Ryu, sorry, ooh, Ryu.

30:53.340 --> 30:54.820
That's my bad pronunciation coming in again.

30:54.820 --> 30:56.900
Actually, okay, well we've got,

30:56.900 --> 31:01.900
I was looking earlier at the people playing the different.

31:03.220 --> 31:04.060
Let me name some more here,

31:04.060 --> 31:05.040
because I have a bunch here.

31:05.040 --> 31:08.620
Jamie Presley from Not Another Teen Movie is Tina.

31:08.620 --> 31:12.400
Nastasia Malth from Elektra is Ayan.

31:12.400 --> 31:16.020
Sarah Carter from Final Destination 2 is Helena.

31:16.020 --> 31:20.460
And Australian pop star Holly Valance is Christy.

31:20.460 --> 31:24.060
She was also in National Lampoon's Pledge This.

31:24.060 --> 31:27.180
Professional wrestler Kevin Nash is Bass.

31:27.180 --> 31:28.500
Oh my god.

31:28.500 --> 31:31.140
Well, the thing is, though, is that in the game, though,

31:31.140 --> 31:33.180
he looks like Hulk Hogan.

31:33.180 --> 31:35.540
But that kind of makes sense.

31:35.540 --> 31:37.460
And Brian J. White, who by the way

31:37.460 --> 31:40.420
is also coming up in a film adaptation of Tekken,

31:40.420 --> 31:41.700
is going to be Zach.

31:41.700 --> 31:43.500
I didn't even know they were doing a film adaptation

31:43.500 --> 31:44.460
of Tekken.

31:44.460 --> 31:48.380
They better have somebody hot playing Jean.

31:48.380 --> 31:54.100
Now I gotta look at the Tekken news.

31:54.100 --> 31:57.420
Oh man, all I gotta say is they got one hot Kasp on there.

31:57.420 --> 32:01.420
I need to see this. That's really uh... Kevin Nash is in it.

32:01.420 --> 32:07.660
Dan's gonna flip. Brian J. White playing Bruce, that's all they've got so far.

32:07.660 --> 32:11.040
Interesting. Kevin Nash, wow. He was

32:11.040 --> 32:16.240
diesel back in the w c w d uh... tech it is being directed by charles stone the

32:16.240 --> 32:17.120
third

32:17.120 --> 32:21.640
uh... right written by michael colary and mike wet

32:21.640 --> 32:22.880
were whoever the

32:22.880 --> 32:26.980
all those people are i'm on video game movie overload but i saved the best for

32:26.980 --> 32:28.560
last boys and girls

32:28.560 --> 32:32.960
well let me give you an idea of who are mike where is he would be writing on

32:32.960 --> 32:34.520
laura croft to greater

32:34.520 --> 32:35.880
and face off

32:35.880 --> 32:38.520
and the original that movie

32:38.520 --> 32:41.760
and um... also uh... michael uh...

32:41.760 --> 32:43.040
correa where

32:43.040 --> 32:47.440
did also writing on the uh... laura croft you're here and as face-off as

32:47.440 --> 32:49.000
well so that's kinda neat

32:49.000 --> 32:51.340
uh... director charles and the third

32:51.340 --> 32:56.480
uh... did mister three thousand uh... drumline in painful so

32:56.480 --> 33:00.620
uh... just a few never heard of the area anyway i'd say the best for last

33:00.620 --> 33:01.440
months

33:01.440 --> 33:02.880
is the best

33:02.880 --> 33:07.000
uh... they're making a movie out of the game postal

33:07.000 --> 33:09.700
postal you remember the very controversial game

33:09.700 --> 33:11.760
where uh... let's see what's the tagline

33:11.760 --> 33:15.620
it's uh... i i i don't know i don't know you basically was just kill people in

33:15.620 --> 33:17.000
all the great ways you can

33:17.000 --> 33:19.640
the director who's attached to the postal movie

33:19.640 --> 33:23.120
you evil

33:23.120 --> 33:24.960
i'd just thought that

33:24.960 --> 33:26.200
most

33:26.200 --> 33:30.800
maybe you know what i do they keep giving that man work he's like all he's

33:30.800 --> 33:31.500
doing it

33:31.500 --> 33:35.600
i'm this match up all the movie possible rights possible and make

33:35.600 --> 33:41.000
crap and keep cheering it out over and over. Honestly, people, have they watched these

33:41.000 --> 33:46.220
movies that have been made? Save your dignity. Yeah, but keep in mind half of Hollywood's

33:46.220 --> 33:51.600
on drugs and the other half is being a lawmaker. This movie game, Uwe Boll by the way for those

33:51.600 --> 33:58.600
who may not know, famous for his work on the films Alone in the Dark, House of the Dead,

33:58.600 --> 34:02.600
of the dead and the upcoming blood rain.

34:02.600 --> 34:07.400
Which by the way is pretty cool and has nothing to do with the damn game at all.

34:07.400 --> 34:11.440
In fact the chick in it does not even have the same hair color.

34:11.440 --> 34:12.940
It has nothing to do with the movie.

34:12.940 --> 34:18.080
Much like Alone in the dark had nothing to do with the movie and oh guess what?

34:18.080 --> 34:19.920
House of the dead had nothing to do with the movie.

34:19.920 --> 34:23.360
They were all prequels because guess what you can do whatever the fuck you want and

34:23.360 --> 34:25.980
you know how the movie is going to end.

34:25.980 --> 34:30.940
Dewey Bowl will get to work on this film, the film adaptation of Postal, but he has

34:30.940 --> 34:36.020
one other game he's got to work on first, and that is the film adaptation of Microsoft's

34:36.020 --> 34:38.220
Dungeon Siege, the PC game.

34:38.220 --> 34:42.700
He's also doing Far Cry.

34:42.700 --> 34:46.700
It's the career video game movie maker, boys and girls.

34:46.700 --> 34:50.880
Honestly, you know what, I remember back in the day when I thought Mortal Kombat the movie

34:50.880 --> 34:52.740
kind of sucked, or Mortal Kombat Annihilation.

34:52.740 --> 34:54.620
It's starting to look pretty good right now, isn't it?

34:54.620 --> 34:59.860
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Mortal Kombat Annihilation is an hour and a half of my life that I really

34:59.860 --> 35:00.860
want back.

35:00.860 --> 35:03.060
Suddenly that Final Fantasy movie wasn't so bad, was it?

35:03.060 --> 35:04.740
Oh, the Final Fantasy movie was good.

35:04.740 --> 35:06.740
Yeah, but it wasn't Final Fantasy.

35:06.740 --> 35:07.740
It wasn't Final Fantasy.

35:07.740 --> 35:09.740
But as a movie, it was good.

35:09.740 --> 35:11.380
It should have been Alien 5.

35:11.380 --> 35:16.940
Here's what it's got to come up with though, I mean Rob, it's like this, basically you've

35:16.940 --> 35:23.980
got a movie coming out this fall, Doom, starring The Rock or whatever.

35:23.980 --> 35:26.060
This has the potential to be pretty good.

35:26.060 --> 35:27.780
I mean, that and the Halo movie.

35:27.780 --> 35:30.340
What we need is good video game movies to come out.

35:30.340 --> 35:33.740
Honestly, I am so not interested in a Halo movie.

35:33.740 --> 35:34.740
Love the game.

35:34.740 --> 35:37.060
I just, I know that a movie will ruin it.

35:37.060 --> 35:38.740
So I'm not interested in the movie.

35:38.740 --> 35:39.740
Okay, okay, well fine, fine.

35:39.740 --> 35:40.740
Maybe not that, but like Spy Hunter.

35:40.740 --> 35:42.980
Okay, these movies, they'll be okay.

35:42.980 --> 35:45.740
They'll be, they could be good, okay?

35:45.740 --> 35:46.740
Could be.

35:46.740 --> 35:47.740
Could be good.

35:47.740 --> 35:48.740
Could be.

35:48.740 --> 35:49.740
That's a big if.

35:49.740 --> 35:51.860
Okay, assuming Doom is good, okay?

35:51.860 --> 35:58.180
the doom movie is good hopefully people say okay this is what they could be and not let

35:58.180 --> 36:03.500
ui bowl direct anything ever again in fact ui bowls should be i want to put a hit out

36:03.500 --> 36:08.660
on ui bowl no stop this is downloadable by anybody on the internet don't go there they

36:08.660 --> 36:13.820
need to do a movie version of hell and have dennis hopper in it yeah of course you know

36:13.820 --> 36:19.820
land of the dead's coming out and he's in it ui bowl is like the video game version

36:19.820 --> 36:21.920
of M. Night Shyamalan. He was just like,

36:21.920 --> 36:23.220
Hey, don't insult...

36:23.220 --> 36:25.480
M. Night Shyamalan. Don't insult him.

36:25.480 --> 36:26.220
Yeah.

36:26.220 --> 36:28.420
So what if the ending of Signs was crap?

36:28.420 --> 36:29.320
I haven't seen Signs.

36:29.320 --> 36:30.320
The Village was pretty good.

36:30.320 --> 36:33.820
Signs was not crap. The Village was retarded.

36:33.820 --> 36:34.820
I like The Village, you should.

36:34.820 --> 36:37.320
The Village was an intelligent movie.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.620
I like The Village, you should.

36:38.620 --> 36:40.020
It required thought.

36:40.020 --> 36:43.020
Oh, wow. I couldn't figure out what the plot twist was gonna be

36:43.020 --> 36:44.020
about five minutes into the movie.

36:44.020 --> 36:46.820
Suddenly, Orange Lounge Radio has turned into the movie poop shoot.

36:46.820 --> 36:48.220
I see. So I think it's time...

36:48.220 --> 36:49.620
Movie poop shoot to go.
