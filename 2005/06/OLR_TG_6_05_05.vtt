Pretty well?

01:30.660 --> 01:31.660
Very well, very well.

01:31.660 --> 01:34.700
I went to Dimple, it's number three for their bestsellers.

01:34.700 --> 01:35.700
Good deal.

01:35.700 --> 01:38.660
And I think it was number three on the US charts.

01:38.660 --> 01:39.660
Cool.

01:39.660 --> 01:40.660
For Billboard.

01:40.660 --> 01:41.660
Good stuff, good stuff.

01:41.660 --> 01:44.020
And I like that they have dance-y songs now because I like dare.

01:44.020 --> 01:47.260
Anyway, we'll talk about music some other time because tonight we've got to talk about

01:47.260 --> 01:48.260
games.

01:48.260 --> 01:51.140
First off though, I want to give a big thank you to one of the podcast directors out there.

02:00.140 --> 02:03.140
That makes me all go squeak.

And we really appreciate all your guys' support.

02:09.140 --> 02:15.140
The ferret is so happy that he had a seizure, seriously.

02:15.140 --> 02:16.140
Great. Good to know.

02:16.140 --> 02:17.140
All right.

02:17.140 --> 02:19.140
Let's start off with a little bit of how is your gaming week,

02:19.140 --> 02:21.820
gaming week the type of stuff you've been playing this week

02:21.820 --> 02:24.820
we'll start off with loki tonight loki what kind of games you've been playing this week

02:24.820 --> 02:29.180
i played not too much in the realm of games i played a little bit of ren goku

02:29.180 --> 02:30.920
just

02:30.920 --> 02:35.300
you know killing more stuff on the same level getting more experienced

02:35.300 --> 02:39.740
beat this stupid game because it's just boring it's one of those ones where you're

02:39.740 --> 02:42.300
so far into it now you just have to beat the damn thing right

02:42.300 --> 02:46.920
uh... not really but like it's just not that great it just doesn't get much

02:46.920 --> 02:52.740
harder. I don't know, but the first generation of PSP games just kind of blew. I don't know

02:52.740 --> 02:53.740
why.

02:53.740 --> 02:56.600
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Luminous. Hello.

02:56.600 --> 03:04.520
Most of the first generation PSP games blew. Granted, there are some good ones, but there's

03:04.520 --> 03:09.120
really not too much out there. Smart Bomb, for example, sucked. However, my boss gave

03:09.120 --> 03:13.840
me a clean copy of it, so I was able to take it back for free, and I still have Smart Bomb.

03:13.840 --> 03:17.520
So I got all my money back and I got the game for free basically.

03:17.520 --> 03:18.520
So it's nice.

03:18.520 --> 03:22.240
But now I have $90 in credit to GameStop and I have nothing to buy there.

03:22.240 --> 03:23.240
$90?

03:23.240 --> 03:24.240
Yep.

03:24.240 --> 03:25.240
Dang.

03:25.240 --> 03:30.080
And then also I played a little bit of The Simpsons arcade game on my MAME cabinet because

03:30.080 --> 03:34.800
I had to fire that up to show Nellie's parents what that was.

03:34.800 --> 03:35.800
So that was kind of neat.

03:35.800 --> 03:39.340
But now I realize I have to go and fix my MAME cabinet because during the process of

03:39.340 --> 03:43.800
moving it to the new apartment, wires came loose, so I got to rewire some stuff.

03:43.800 --> 03:44.800
So that sucks.

03:44.800 --> 03:45.800
Yikes.

03:45.800 --> 03:46.800
Yeah.

03:46.800 --> 03:48.800
But it's nice to hear you're actually using that cabinet after all the effort you put

03:48.800 --> 03:49.800
in the building.

03:49.800 --> 03:52.360
I use it mainly now just watching movies on my other PC.

03:52.360 --> 03:56.000
We were watching the Star Wars movies that I have borrowed from the internet.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
It's a main cabinet.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
You don't watch movies on it.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
You play games.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Old school games.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
It has a TV in there.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
We watch TV on it.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.720
But yeah, we do play games on it, and it was fun.

04:05.720 --> 04:10.520
got a kick out of the Simpsons game but you know after a while I just had to turn it off.

04:10.520 --> 04:11.960
But um, a lot of fun.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.360
Alright, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

04:14.360 --> 04:17.880
I played lots and lots of PSO.

04:17.880 --> 04:18.880
Blue Burst, correct?

04:18.880 --> 04:19.880
Yes, Blue Burst.

04:19.880 --> 04:23.440
I played some Silent Hill 3 and then turned it off because I was kind of bored and I watched

04:23.440 --> 04:25.440
Dan beat Fire Emblem.

04:25.440 --> 04:26.440
Which Fire Emblem?

04:26.440 --> 04:27.440
The new game?

04:27.440 --> 04:28.440
The Sacred Stones.

04:28.440 --> 04:29.440
Oh okay, cool.

04:29.440 --> 04:30.440
Yeah.

04:30.440 --> 04:31.440
The one that just came out, the GameCube one, it's not out yet.

04:31.440 --> 04:32.440
Ah, alright.

04:32.440 --> 04:37.120
but, um, but yeah, I got to see the end of, uh, Fire Emblem. That's, like, all he plays

04:37.120 --> 04:41.200
now is, well, let's put in the Game Boy Advance, play and play, uh, Fire Emblem.

04:41.200 --> 04:45.520
You know, Fire Emblem was one of those games that was popular in Japan for a long time,

04:45.520 --> 04:48.040
but it took a long time to come over here, and now it's-

04:48.040 --> 04:50.480
Well, you know what they're playing today? Hmm?

04:50.480 --> 04:54.140
Busted out the Super Nintendo and popped in the Super Famicom card of Fire Emblem 3.

04:54.140 --> 04:58.520
I saw that when I went over there. I saw that one of your friends was playing, like, a Japanese

04:58.520 --> 05:02.800
game on the Super Nintendo, this is the kind of stuff I only see happen at your house.

05:02.800 --> 05:07.760
Yeah, and of course like upside down next to it was the PS2 and the Dreamcast tucked

05:07.760 --> 05:10.600
into the corner and the Xbox dancing a jig.

05:10.600 --> 05:11.600
Show off.

05:11.600 --> 05:13.360
And I saw Sega Fantasy 5.

05:13.360 --> 05:14.360
What's that?

05:14.360 --> 05:17.640
Well, you know what Sega Fantasy 6 was, right?

05:17.640 --> 05:22.420
It was about the bunch of different gaming systems going up to kick the Xbox's ass Final

05:22.420 --> 05:23.800
Fantasy 6 style.

05:23.800 --> 05:28.800
But I watched Sega Fantasy 5 which was frustrating because the text would move just

05:29.160 --> 05:35.040
fast enough that I would catch words and bits and pieces of Kana and not be able to read the whole thing so I was like

05:37.360 --> 05:39.920
That's cool, I didn't know I didn't know that existed that's kind of funny

05:41.760 --> 05:43.920
Sega fanboys and fangirls are pretty rabid

05:43.920 --> 05:49.880
I'll see about posting link on the orange lounge radio comm life journal forum very nice nice plug

05:49.880 --> 05:54.760
Alright, my gaming week, you know, there's not a whole lot of new stuff out there that

05:54.760 --> 05:56.720
I really wanted to check out.

05:56.720 --> 06:01.000
I wanted to buy a new DS game this week, but really, all that's out right now, I think

06:01.000 --> 06:04.920
the only game that came out was Madagascar, which is a game I might be excited about if

06:04.920 --> 06:09.000
I was seven years old, but I'm not, so I could care less.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Then, Polarium.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
I played another game, actually.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Okay, what's that?

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
Lots and lots of the Pac-Pix demo at GameStop.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Alright.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.840
I thought Meteos was coming out.

06:17.840 --> 06:19.040
Meteos is out June 27th.

06:19.040 --> 06:23.960
It's the day after my birthday and I couldn't be more happier that the DS is getting that.

06:23.960 --> 06:28.440
Sigma Star Saga is coming out, Game Boy Advance, I think, or, yeah, I think that's Game Boy

06:28.440 --> 06:29.440
Advance.

06:29.440 --> 06:32.680
That one's actually supposed to be pretty interesting because it's, imagine, you know,

06:32.680 --> 06:37.720
your typical RPG, but instead of the random battles, it's random side-scroller shooters.

06:37.720 --> 06:39.520
Oh, that's cool.

06:39.520 --> 06:40.520
Huh.

06:40.520 --> 06:41.520
Interesting.

06:41.520 --> 06:44.880
Well, so since I didn't really get anything new, I went back to my collection and I said,

06:44.880 --> 06:47.120
well, what are some games I really didn't play enough of?

06:47.120 --> 06:51.320
So I'm checking out Mario DS, Mario 64 DS, because I really didn't get that far into

06:51.320 --> 06:52.320
it.

06:52.320 --> 06:54.920
I think I got about 30 stars, and then I said, screw it, I got more games to play.

06:54.920 --> 06:58.540
But I really want more minigames right now, because surprisingly enough, the minigames

06:58.540 --> 07:02.180
to me were the best part of Mario DS.

07:02.180 --> 07:06.640
And also, I don't know if it's just me, but Mario 64, and I'm going to get a lot of crap

07:06.640 --> 07:10.960
and hate letters for this, I think Mario 64 is one of the most overrated games ever, because

07:10.960 --> 07:13.400
I see a lot of lists out there.

07:13.400 --> 07:16.880
You know how every website out there has got to have a top 100 list.

07:16.880 --> 07:22.760
And Super Mario 64 is always in the top 3 of the greatest platformers or the greatest

07:22.760 --> 07:23.760
games even.

07:23.760 --> 07:30.940
You know, I have to disagree with you, but I have special memories of Mario 64, because

07:30.940 --> 07:34.800
Dan and I would play Mario 64 together and bond over it.

07:34.800 --> 07:38.160
Well yeah, see, you got special stuff there.

07:38.160 --> 07:41.800
Now add one single word in there, then it makes all the sense in the world.

07:41.800 --> 07:44.480
Mario Kart 64, that was the game.

07:44.480 --> 07:45.480
That was the game.

07:45.480 --> 07:46.480
That game rocks.

07:46.480 --> 07:50.840
Mario 64 for me was nothing but a bunch of like frustrating cameras and I don't know,

07:50.840 --> 07:55.480
I mean it was, it was darn innovative at the time, yeah I gotta give it that, but I just,

07:55.480 --> 08:01.200
I don't know if I would place it so near the top in the great, you know, list of video

08:01.200 --> 08:03.960
game greats, because there's other Mario games I could think of that were better than Mario

08:03.960 --> 08:04.960
64.

08:04.960 --> 08:09.400
And what I also don't get, when people place Mario Sunshine at the bottom, say it was a

08:09.400 --> 08:10.400
horrible, horrible game.

08:10.400 --> 08:11.880
Mario Sunshine was cool!

08:11.880 --> 08:16.560
But yeah, Mario Sunshine to me was not that bad.

08:16.560 --> 08:20.320
I thought it was... It was like Mario 64 with water.

08:20.320 --> 08:23.560
I hate to say it was better than Mario 64, but I was

08:23.560 --> 08:27.200
entertained longer by Mario Sunshine than I was in Mario. And honestly, folks, if you have a

08:27.200 --> 08:28.120
GameCube,

08:28.120 --> 08:31.920
you should go out and buy it. It's only $19.99, probably less now.

08:31.920 --> 08:37.400
And really, as far as new cube games coming out, there isn't a whole lot.

08:37.400 --> 08:40.640
so hello Twilight Princess that's gonna be the one that well

08:40.640 --> 08:44.680
there isn't a whole lot coming out period okay we're kind of in a slow period anyway

08:44.680 --> 08:45.740
honestly there's like

08:45.740 --> 08:48.860
Geist and Killer7 and that's about it

08:48.860 --> 08:53.040
well I'm glad you bring that up because we're gonna get into tonight's news and

08:53.040 --> 08:56.300
starting off with GameCube games getting delayed

08:56.300 --> 09:00.400
and guess what two games got delayed Geist and Killer7

09:00.400 --> 09:04.960
Killer7 is now in July now and Geist is also in July

09:04.960 --> 09:10.160
actually guys say things in August now killer 7 is going to be out July 7

09:10.160 --> 09:13.540

09:16.860 --> 09:20.420
I'm August is going to be the release date for guys

09:20.420 --> 09:24.300
I keep up on that stuff yeah well I know the value for your work stuff but

09:24.300 --> 09:28.780
you have to make it sound exciting for a podcast is exciting you do that for me

09:28.780 --> 09:33.140
it is exciting because he there's not them a good GameCube games come out

09:33.140 --> 09:37.180
A little bit of PSP news, Loki, you'll love this one.

09:37.180 --> 09:40.440
PSP is getting some bonafide

09:40.440 --> 09:43.740
actual porn. I read about that, that's awesome.

09:43.740 --> 09:48.780
Not somebody putting the porn on their memory sticks as most PSP users probably

09:48.780 --> 09:50.700
did the first day they got it. UMD porn.

09:50.700 --> 09:55.180
Actual UMD porn coming out in Japan and the

09:55.180 --> 10:00.180
company that's putting this out is Glaze, G-L-A-Y apostrophe Z,

10:00.180 --> 10:06.820
Starting off July 8th, the titles will be anywhere between 1,995 yen

10:06.820 --> 10:10.940
and just under 4,000 yen. That's about 18 to 37 dollars

10:10.940 --> 10:14.820
US. Now I can't... I will

10:14.820 --> 10:17.780
horribly butcher some of these names if I try to pronounce them. However,

10:17.780 --> 10:21.780
I like some of this. On July 22nd, Bi-body

10:21.780 --> 10:26.380
Aeroterrorist Noah. Aeroterrorist, what is that?

10:26.380 --> 10:31.340
I don't know. And let's see. HMP Countdown 2005.

10:31.340 --> 10:34.740
HMP... Like Humping? I don't know. HMP... HUMP COUNTDOWN!

10:34.740 --> 10:38.460
July 8th. Kanishiro Anna.

10:38.460 --> 10:43.140
Koiku Soap Jew. I just like that because it has the word soap in it. So I don't know.

10:43.140 --> 10:46.260
Maybe it's like Bubble Bath Babes, the porn. I don't know.

10:46.260 --> 10:49.260
I can't. Do you really want to read this though?

10:49.260 --> 10:52.500
It doesn't matter. It's all good though. But hey,

10:52.500 --> 10:55.780
that's pretty cool. They should make Jew on the game. But too bad though,

10:55.780 --> 10:59.700
it's going to be price censored because they censored it porn.

10:59.700 --> 11:03.660
Porn in Japan is pixelated. That sucks. Mosaic porn is no fun.

11:03.660 --> 11:10.300
Interesting. What do you think? Is this something that's going to catch on?

11:10.300 --> 11:13.420
Is this something we're going to see in the US? You know, honestly,

11:13.420 --> 11:16.820
probably. You know who I actually see probably

11:16.820 --> 11:19.860
putting stuff out for it and be like Playboy? Something like that.

11:19.860 --> 11:23.020
We did have a story a couple months ago about Playboy.com.

11:23.020 --> 11:28.180
They're ibod crap and honestly you might see some of that stuff.

11:28.180 --> 11:35.420
I think even better is downloadable content because honestly I couldn't see buying.

11:35.420 --> 11:39.340
I just can't see a situation where this would come in handy.

11:39.340 --> 11:40.340
Come in handy.

11:40.340 --> 11:41.340
Get it?

11:41.340 --> 11:42.340
Money.

11:42.340 --> 11:43.340
Yeah, whatever.

11:43.340 --> 11:48.500
I just don't see it being something I'd spend money on.

11:48.500 --> 11:53.060
Again, I don't see myself spending money on UMDs, and here's a kind of story that ties

11:53.060 --> 11:54.060
in there.

11:54.060 --> 11:59.880
I'm not sure if we can cover it, but actually we're talking about the first two UMDs actually

11:59.880 --> 12:08.420
hit 100,000 in sales, 100,000 units sold, and the first two would be House of Flying

12:08.420 --> 12:11.320
Daggers and Resident Evil Apocalypse.

12:11.320 --> 12:15.500
It took them only two months to reach 100,000, whereas the first DVD to reach 100,000, which

12:15.500 --> 12:24.980
which was, I believe, Air Force One to reach 100,000. It took nine months. That's how fast

12:24.980 --> 12:25.980
this stuff is selling.

12:25.980 --> 12:29.220
I would have never guessed UMD, and I know I've said it on this show, and boy did I get

12:29.220 --> 12:31.300
proven wrong. I did not think UMDs would take off.

12:31.300 --> 12:42.100
They're selling. It's crazy. UMDs to me are like DVHS. It seems like such a useless format,

12:42.100 --> 12:46.620
but people are buying this stuff because honestly this is like a replacement for a portable

12:46.620 --> 12:52.460
DVD player. You know what it reminds me of? When did DVD players really take off when

12:52.460 --> 12:56.580
PlayStation 2 came out? So maybe it's kind of similar where people don't want to buy

12:56.580 --> 13:02.500
portable DVD players but they'll buy a PSP which is like a portable DVD player. I don't

13:02.500 --> 13:06.220
know. I can't explain it. Hey, whatever. Yeah, that's cool. Whatever makes you happy. Dark

13:06.220 --> 13:10.900
Sakura, you had a comment? Porn on the PSP? It's going to be really big in Japan. Here

13:10.900 --> 13:12.460
it's not going to fly.

13:12.460 --> 13:13.460
I don't think so.

13:13.460 --> 13:17.660
Yeah, I don't think they're going to do it because age demographic, it's not going to

13:17.660 --> 13:18.660
happen.

13:18.660 --> 13:19.660
We'll see.

13:19.660 --> 13:20.660
Also, a PSP news.

13:20.660 --> 13:26.340
Now, going along with PSP news in Japan, they're saying it's slumping over in Tokyo, actually,

13:26.340 --> 13:27.340
in Japan.

13:27.340 --> 13:31.660
A new story coming out of Tokyo saying that the sales of the PSP are slumping.

13:31.660 --> 13:39.240
From the week of May 23rd to 29th, only four PSP games were in the complete top 50, none

13:39.240 --> 13:45.920
of them cracking the top 20, whereas you look on the other half of it, six Nintendo DS titles

13:45.920 --> 13:52.120
in the top 20, Nintendogs doing huge business over in Japan, and I predict it's going to

13:52.120 --> 13:53.760
do very well over here as well.

13:53.760 --> 13:55.720
Nintendogs is so cute!

13:55.720 --> 13:57.440
It's my favorite thing over at E3.

13:57.440 --> 13:58.600
I love the puppies.

13:58.600 --> 14:01.320
I played Frisbee with the puppies.

14:01.320 --> 14:03.520
Is this a sign of things to come?

14:03.520 --> 14:08.200
Is the DS going to outdo the PSP here in America?

14:08.200 --> 14:18.200
It's America. We want it bigger, faster. It needs to do more shit. It needs Sony because the world sucks the cock of Sony.

14:18.200 --> 14:29.200
There was honestly a big launch of games from the beginning. They had about 20 or so games out for this. Now it's dead as far as what's coming out.

14:29.200 --> 14:36.200
That's what's happening. There's only a couple games. People are tired of the old games and now they're waiting for more stuff. It's in DS syndrome now.

14:36.200 --> 14:40.720
Exactly what I was thinking is PSP is now suffering the same thing DS is I would say

14:40.720 --> 14:43.160
to most extent still suffering through.

14:43.160 --> 14:45.640
Both systems to me are at a dead still.

14:45.640 --> 14:50.600
We don't have any really great games out on the horizon.

14:50.600 --> 14:53.960
Maybe Meteos on the DS of course coming later this month.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.160
That's by the res guy.

14:55.160 --> 15:02.360
Looking at the PSP calendar, Batman Begins is coming out in June, Midnight Club 3 Dub

15:02.360 --> 15:05.360
Edition now that could be very cool also coming out in June.

15:05.360 --> 15:09.160
the only game slated for July, according to the calendar I have here, Star Wars Episode

15:09.160 --> 15:12.160
3. So there's really not a whole lot of stuff coming out this summer.

15:12.160 --> 15:15.880
Not necessarily. There's Armored Core is going to be coming out, Armored Core Formula

15:15.880 --> 15:23.360
Prime, and also Dead to Rights will be coming out for the PSP as well in July or June, I

15:23.360 --> 15:28.640
believe. Those are going to be coming out, and I haven't heard anything about Star Wars

15:28.640 --> 15:34.160
yet and the Revenge of the Sith. I think that I got pushed back, and same with Midnight

15:34.160 --> 15:38.880
Club 3 I think. DS on the other hand, DS is starting to pick up a

15:38.880 --> 15:41.440
little steam here now they've been slumping through the past few months they're

15:41.440 --> 15:43.640
starting to pick up a little steam. You've got GoldenEye,

15:43.640 --> 15:48.600
Kirby Canvas Curse, Bomberman, Meteos, Tom Clancy Splinter Cell all this month.

15:48.600 --> 15:53.320
Nanostray is going to be awesome. And Nanostray in July along with Spyro

15:53.320 --> 15:55.360
Shadow Legacy also coming out in July.

15:55.360 --> 15:57.960
So you can kind of see that it's starting to pick up a little bit of steam

15:57.960 --> 15:59.200
whereas the PSP is in that

15:59.200 --> 16:02.400
kind of, at least in my opinion, now everybody's got everything but

16:02.400 --> 16:05.540
for me and the games I'm into. PSP's slumping right now

16:05.540 --> 16:10.000
whereas DS is finally starting to pick up steam. Yeah, but the PSP is going to be

16:10.000 --> 16:12.160
getting a lot of play in my house for me when

16:12.160 --> 16:16.460
Papakaros comes out. Aren't you getting sick of this crap though where games

16:16.460 --> 16:20.120
or the launches put all their games out

16:20.120 --> 16:23.280
for the launch titles and then it's dead for like four months?

16:23.280 --> 16:26.520
I'm honestly kind of looking forward to seeing Sony get screwed over for their arrogance.

16:26.520 --> 16:30.780
That right there though, see that right there, that's what's gonna make the revolution rock.

16:30.780 --> 16:34.260
If the next-gen systems pull the same crap,

16:34.260 --> 16:38.700
I'm not usually one for resting on your laurels, but Nintendo

16:38.700 --> 16:42.700
has always had, even though they haven't been at the top

16:42.700 --> 16:46.700
of everything, they've had the staying power, they are stable.

16:46.700 --> 16:50.300
See, again, this backs up what I said last week when I said I don't think that it's

16:50.300 --> 16:53.620
such a bad thing that Revolution wasn't shown at E3 because I think they're

16:53.620 --> 16:56.740
taking their sweetest time so that they can.

16:56.740 --> 17:00.540
yeah they can they're doing it because they can because they know

17:00.540 --> 17:03.620
they have been a trusted name for how long

17:03.620 --> 17:06.720
I with Sony there in the beginning no

17:06.720 --> 17:09.920
Sony was the bitch of Nintendo for a while and

17:09.920 --> 17:13.800
they did the sound processor for the Super Nintendo and we're working on the

17:13.800 --> 17:15.420
you're gonna get angry emails on that one

17:15.420 --> 17:18.460
think think imagine with me here

17:18.460 --> 17:21.460
just for a second here's where Nintendo is going to be revealed

17:21.460 --> 17:24.900
Dark soccer is not finished I'm still had a rant to go

17:24.900 --> 17:28.780
But Nintendo has been there since the late eighties.

17:28.780 --> 17:32.240
There has always been a Nintendo system

17:32.240 --> 17:35.620
since I would say right after

17:35.620 --> 17:38.820
the uh, now I think the Master System was out first.

17:38.820 --> 17:42.820
I was gonna say, I was just about to ask you though, couldn't you say the same thing about Sega? They were there in the beginning too, look at what happened to them.

17:42.820 --> 17:44.620
Yeah, but Sega,

17:44.620 --> 17:48.300
Sega actually started off doing third-party publishing because I've got

17:48.300 --> 17:50.380
some Sega games on my Colecovision

17:50.380 --> 17:54.420
and then they went, you know, they were pretty strong but I think that they sort of shot

17:54.420 --> 17:59.580
themselves in the foot with the Dreamcast by it was there early it was

17:59.580 --> 18:05.780
out but they needed to market it a little differently I think and then they

18:05.780 --> 18:08.940
actually really got fucked over by the fact that Sony said hey we're gonna jump

18:08.940 --> 18:12.620
in the market too that is what screwed over the Dreamcast it's a matter of

18:12.620 --> 18:17.500
timing hmm Loki anyways I was gonna say imagine if you will because this is why

18:17.500 --> 18:20.820
the revolution is gonna rock first off when it comes out it's gonna have launch

18:20.820 --> 18:24.840
games that'd be cool but the thing is there will be a dead period of games well

18:24.840 --> 18:27.240
one of the things that's going to be coming out is some of those downloads

18:27.240 --> 18:30.440
remember you can download everything from you know Donkey Kong up to Mario

18:30.440 --> 18:35.000
Sunshine basically for some of those are gonna be free that's gonna be cool but

18:35.000 --> 18:37.920
here's the other thing that I think they're going to do download play to

18:37.920 --> 18:42.640
your DS all those games you're downloading to your your revolution

18:42.640 --> 18:45.880
you're gonna build down them to your DS put in sleep mode and take it with you

18:45.880 --> 18:49.320
interesting thought interesting thought I like that idea well we'll see what

18:49.320 --> 18:51.960
happens let's move on though anyway we got a lot of news to get through tonight

18:51.960 --> 18:57.840
on dirge of cerebrus or cerebrus cerebrus cerebrus my horrible

18:57.840 --> 19:07.960
pronunciation skills coming out or as we call it Vincent may cry website is up

19:07.960 --> 19:12.040
and you get new downloads and you get more information on the story and

19:12.040 --> 19:16.700
everything going on you can check that out and it's square dash enix dot co dot

19:16.700 --> 19:33.820
You have no idea how big my Vincent fangirlism has been.

19:33.820 --> 19:43.380
I had a directory of something like 3,000 doujinshi official art fan art pictures of

19:43.380 --> 19:45.780
Vincent and I lost the one when my hard drive crashed.

19:45.780 --> 19:50.280
Wow. You know what's funny? I was a scary fangirl. When I played through Final Fantasy 7 the

19:50.280 --> 19:50.980
first time

19:50.980 --> 19:55.540
I never got Vincent. You didn't know the right questions to ask. I guess so.

19:55.540 --> 19:58.660
Wasn't that Yuffie? Vincent's the one where you open the safe.

19:58.660 --> 20:01.820
Vincent, you have to talk to him a certain way. That's right.

20:01.820 --> 20:05.460
And he wasn't in the safe, he was in a coffin. Sexy!

20:05.460 --> 20:08.740
Anyway, let's move on.

20:08.740 --> 20:12.340
Retailer news. Very interesting some of the things retailers are doing this week.

20:12.340 --> 20:16.140
GameStop is already taking pre-orders for Halo 3

20:16.140 --> 20:20.740
which, that doesn't surprise me considering every time I buy something

20:20.740 --> 20:22.900
at GameStop or really any store these days

20:22.900 --> 20:27.900
they always want me to pre-order something. Would you like to pre-order?

20:27.900 --> 20:31.940
I understand but it's just... You know the thing is though, is it by getting your pre-order in early

20:31.940 --> 20:33.460
you're guaranteed for shipment?

20:33.460 --> 20:39.220
I personally don't do it because I'm a very spontaneous person and I like to

20:39.220 --> 20:41.820
buy games, just walk in and I feel like buying this day.

20:41.820 --> 20:45.060
I'm not a big pre-order person, I'm really not, and I have never

20:45.060 --> 20:49.260
been denied a game I want by its out-of-stock or anything.

20:49.260 --> 20:52.900
I always know how to find it. But whatever, pre-ordering's your thing.

20:52.900 --> 20:57.260
Honestly, you can probably go to the GameStop now and pre-order the PS4,

20:57.260 --> 21:00.180
you know, something like that. They'll take pre-orders for anything.

21:00.180 --> 21:04.100
This was the other interesting thing, though. Walmart listed on its website this week

21:04.100 --> 21:08.540
Katamari Damacy for the PSP, and the world let out a collective

21:08.540 --> 21:12.420
Huh? Because we all thought Katamari Damacy was supposed to be on the DS.

21:12.420 --> 21:15.500
So what do you think? Is there any merit to this? I go,

21:15.500 --> 21:18.740
no, this is BS. I think it's just a mistake. Just like,

21:18.740 --> 21:21.860
what was it, they had marijuana.

21:21.860 --> 21:26.580
Target.com was selling marijuana at one point, which was some Web Kids

21:26.580 --> 21:30.700
joke. I think, I don't think you can really trust

21:30.700 --> 21:35.420
Walmart.com as your source for gaming. Honestly, I would have heard about it

21:35.420 --> 21:36.420
already because,

21:36.420 --> 21:57.420
would have been announced, I would have had to put it on my list. But anyways, the thing is, as far as games come, I'm totally lost now, but I'm not surprised that Halo 3, they've got pre-orders for it, but I wouldn't take that as, like, God, as it's coming out right away. I mean, it'll probably be a launch game or something pretty close.

21:57.420 --> 22:02.420
Halo 3 is not going to be a launch game, it's going to come out when the PS3 is put out.

22:02.420 --> 22:07.420
It's stupid. Honestly, I'm not going to get this game system because Halo 3 is coming out.

22:07.420 --> 22:11.420
People that have the Xbox buy Halo 3. It doesn't matter. We'll buy both.

22:11.420 --> 22:21.420
I will buy the Xbox 360 when Halo 3 is out because there's a better chance that the Xbox 360 might get its first price cut before then in order to entice sales of it.

22:21.420 --> 22:23.420
It's not going to matter at my house. We get them all.

22:23.420 --> 22:28.420
I know. Speaking of which, since we're talking about stuff in vendors and all that wonderful stuff.

22:28.420 --> 22:34.940
wonderful stuff. PSP, there's rumors about it actually getting a price cut to $200, and

22:34.940 --> 22:39.460
the reason why they are saying that this is going to happen, and one, they've heard it

22:39.460 --> 22:43.540
from like a friend who heard it from somebody, you know, that type of thing. Well, there's

22:43.540 --> 22:49.700
that. And then there's also the fact that apparently, I guess, Best Buy is listing now

22:49.700 --> 22:59.100
on their website, Best Buy and EB Games are now stocking the official stuff like the Sony

22:59.100 --> 23:05.260
headphones, the little soft case, the 32 meg memory stick card, and the battery chargers.

23:05.260 --> 23:10.220
They're all sale individually, which this stuff's usually bundled with it.

23:10.220 --> 23:14.980
So if there's going to be a non-bundle, then it's going to drop in price.

23:14.980 --> 23:18.500
Well, logically, but okay, that's all good I guess.

23:18.500 --> 23:21.720
at the same time it doesn't make much sense because you have to have a

23:21.720 --> 23:24.300
memory stick with the PSP so you're going to end up buying that separately.

23:24.300 --> 23:27.340
You have to have some type of charger so you're going to end up buying that.

23:27.340 --> 23:31.340
Honestly, if I think what's going to happen though, the charger, I could see

23:31.340 --> 23:33.420
maybe replacement memory stick as a replacement.

23:33.420 --> 23:36.700
I think if they were going to do one, it would be just

23:36.700 --> 23:39.860
system, memory stick, charger.

23:39.860 --> 23:43.900
We'll see what happens. Alright, we here at Orange Launch Radio, we're not just

23:43.900 --> 23:46.700
here to bring you the latest and greatest in video game news, but we're

23:46.700 --> 23:47.980
here to better your life.

23:47.980 --> 23:51.980
because if we just sat around and played video games all day long

23:51.980 --> 23:55.500
we would have no time to go out drinking so

23:55.500 --> 23:59.780
one way we're gonna better your life here is to have the one and only Dark

23:59.780 --> 24:01.140
Sakura give you her

24:01.140 --> 24:05.380
advice column. Dark Sakura what do you have to tell the kids about tonight?

24:05.380 --> 24:10.020
Today's bit of advice is how to jump from a bridge or cliff into a river

24:10.020 --> 24:13.340
so that when people tell you to take a flying leap you'll know what to do.

24:13.340 --> 24:17.060
Now kids don't really try this at home

24:17.060 --> 24:39.500
1. Jump feet first. 2. Keep your body entirely vertical. 3. Squeeze your feet together. 4.

24:39.500 --> 24:44.300
Enter the water feet first, but clench your buttocks together. If you do not, water may

24:44.300 --> 24:54.260
rush in and cause severe internal damage. 5. Protect your crotch area by covering it

24:54.260 --> 25:02.500
with your hands. 6. Immediately after you hit the water, spread

25:02.500 --> 25:06.300
your arms and legs wide. Move them back and forth to generate resistance, which will slow

25:06.300 --> 25:14.140
your plunge to the bottom but my uh honest uh final piece of advice in this

25:14.140 --> 25:19.340
drown also avoid rocks that's like a major one right there

25:19.340 --> 25:23.260
of if you see rocks poking out of the water might not be a good idea to jump

25:23.260 --> 25:25.740
towards it

25:27.420 --> 25:30.460
please don't do that at home you're not vin diesel you don't need to be jumping

25:30.460 --> 25:34.700
off the bridge what cliff diving not well he used to

25:34.700 --> 25:37.580
I'll jump off the rainbow bridge.

25:37.580 --> 25:39.100
Wow.

25:39.100 --> 25:40.220
Wowee wow.

25:40.220 --> 25:42.940
Did he remember to tighten his buttocks when he jumped?

25:42.940 --> 25:44.140
I'll have to ask him.

25:44.140 --> 25:46.140
Please ask him.

25:46.140 --> 25:49.260
Moving on, gaming companies.

25:49.260 --> 25:52.140
I know that most of you guys are located in Silicon Valley,

25:52.140 --> 25:54.180
although the rest of you guys, some

25:54.180 --> 25:57.860
are located elsewhere in the nation, New York, wherever.

25:57.860 --> 26:02.340
Louisiana is trying to get you to move your company over

26:02.340 --> 26:03.180
there.

26:03.180 --> 26:08.500
recently passed Louisiana Bill 341. It grants game developers generous tax

26:08.500 --> 26:09.100
credits

26:09.100 --> 26:12.380
if they relocate to Louisiana. It was

26:12.380 --> 26:15.820
unanimously passed by the Senate. It gives a 10 percent

26:15.820 --> 26:19.300
state tax income credit to studios that spend

26:19.300 --> 26:22.940
anywhere between three hundred thousand dollars and eight million

26:22.940 --> 26:27.420
by setting up shop in Louisiana and then remaining there for one year.

26:27.420 --> 26:30.580
Do you see game companies rushing to Louisiana?

26:30.580 --> 26:33.580
It could happen if they can live through the freaking humidity.

26:33.580 --> 26:36.580
The first thing I was going to comment on too is that, you know...

26:36.580 --> 26:38.580
I have been there.

26:38.580 --> 26:42.580
Here's one thing that Louisiana, and with all due respect to our listeners in Louisiana,

26:42.580 --> 26:44.580
I love you guys for tuning in, but let's think about it.

26:44.580 --> 26:47.580
They probably don't have to blow on Nintendo cartridges down there

26:47.580 --> 26:49.580
to get them to work anymore because it's so damn human.

26:49.580 --> 26:51.580
No, you just have to deal with them resting.

26:51.580 --> 26:53.580
No, no, no, you laugh.

26:53.580 --> 26:55.580
No, I laugh because it's true.

26:55.580 --> 26:57.580
But it happened.

26:57.580 --> 27:01.740
you have to clean your contacts with alcohol

27:01.740 --> 27:06.060
for our buddies over in the UK Dark Sakura's got your back what's going on

27:06.060 --> 27:07.500
for the British folk

27:07.500 --> 27:10.220
this is about the Gizmondo

27:10.220 --> 27:13.780
the Gizmondo is put out by a UK company

27:13.780 --> 27:17.980
actually looking over their stats it's a pretty pretty impressive little system

27:17.980 --> 27:19.780
I got to play it, I got to play Johnny whatever

27:19.780 --> 27:23.420
sort of like a game where you wail hard on your guitar and then you have a little

27:23.420 --> 27:25.100
karaoke mode that plays sort of

27:25.100 --> 27:29.940
like Guitar Freaks meets Karaoke Revolution

27:29.940 --> 27:34.620
but basically it's going to be powered by Windows CE

27:34.620 --> 27:37.860
it has a 2.8 inch TFT color screen

27:37.860 --> 27:41.740
it actually supports MPEG4 movie

27:41.740 --> 27:44.620
multimedia messaging, digital camera,

27:44.620 --> 27:47.620
GPRS network

27:47.620 --> 27:51.060
basically it's looking like it's trying to really compete with the PSP

27:51.060 --> 27:54.580
just to run over some of the features 400 megahertz

27:54.580 --> 27:58.500
ARM 9 processor, 64-bit graphics processor

27:58.500 --> 28:04.580
8-way D-pad, left and right triggers, all these like bajillion buttons on it

28:04.580 --> 28:08.680
integrated digital camera, 3D game engine

28:08.680 --> 28:12.300
But Dark Sakura, can you play pornography on it?

28:12.300 --> 28:17.500
Eventually. MPEG-4 video, come on. It has Windows Media Player 9 on it

28:17.500 --> 28:22.220
Oh, there you go. Polyphonic ringtones, apparently it's also gonna

28:22.220 --> 28:25.620
try to kick Nokia back under the grave

28:25.620 --> 28:29.500
even if they aren't already there sorry but I mean come on

28:29.500 --> 28:32.980
yeah this is like the nail in the coffin games coming out conflict vietnam

28:32.980 --> 28:33.860
karmageddon

28:33.860 --> 28:38.020
battle stations midway total overdose SSX3

28:38.020 --> 28:41.100
FIFA soccer sticky balls

28:41.100 --> 28:44.940
Rayman well if they relocate to

28:44.940 --> 28:48.500
you know Louisiana then that won't be a problem

28:48.500 --> 28:55.320
Also, that game Johnny Whatever, which we have pictures of on OrangeLoudRadio.com on

28:55.320 --> 28:56.320
my E3 gallery.

28:56.320 --> 28:57.320
Yes.

28:57.320 --> 29:00.700
Any idea of her release date for our British friends?

29:00.700 --> 29:04.940
It actually is scheduled to be hitting the U.S. August 11th, 2005.

29:04.940 --> 29:07.900
Which means what, they get it three months later as typical?

29:07.900 --> 29:08.900
I have no idea.

29:08.900 --> 29:09.900
Sorry.

29:09.900 --> 29:10.900
Sorry.

29:10.900 --> 29:11.900
You guys know I'm telling the truth.

29:11.900 --> 29:12.900
Sorry.

29:12.900 --> 29:14.120
I'm having a feeling it's likely going to be coming out there around the same time.

29:14.120 --> 29:16.100
It's not giving a difference in the dates.

29:16.100 --> 29:17.100
That would be good.

29:17.100 --> 29:21.340
If it's a portable system, they don't exactly have to redo the specs, because that's usually

29:21.340 --> 29:27.340
why games take so long, because they have to go from NTSC to PAL, and all that. That's

29:27.340 --> 29:30.100
usually why games get delayed, but they won't have to worry about that with Gizmodo.

29:30.100 --> 29:34.780
No, and the thing is, it's like the same reason you can play PAL discs on an NTSC on your

29:34.780 --> 29:40.100
computer, I mean, it's the same difference. But it really is looking like it's trying

29:40.100 --> 29:45.660
to go head-to-head with the PSP, and on top of that, it actually takes flash drive.

29:45.660 --> 29:50.060
I actually see it as more, not so much PSP, but more N-Gage, what N-Gage really should

29:50.060 --> 29:51.060
have been.

29:51.060 --> 29:52.060
Kind of.

29:52.060 --> 29:53.300
It looks like it's trying to bridge the fence.

29:53.300 --> 29:57.260
I don't want to have to compare the N-Gage to anything, because nobody is deserving of

29:57.260 --> 30:00.620
that kind of punishment, but, you know, compared to a doggone.

30:00.620 --> 30:04.020
But apparently it's being put out by Tiger.

30:04.020 --> 30:05.020
Yeah, good.

30:05.020 --> 30:06.020
Would you?

30:06.020 --> 30:09.980
Tiger used to put out all those little LCD games back in the day, beep, beep, beep, beep,

30:09.980 --> 30:10.980
beep, beep.

30:10.980 --> 30:15.180
But Tiger's been around for a while, you know, and honestly, I honestly, honestly really

30:15.180 --> 30:20.500
think that I'm going to get a Gizmondo. After playing it at E3, and also with just the excellent

30:20.500 --> 30:23.060
show they put on, it's looking like it's going to be big.

30:23.060 --> 30:27.740
You're not going to get it just because you have every other console system known to man.

30:27.740 --> 30:29.540
I am a completion whore.

30:29.540 --> 30:32.620
I will just borrow yours, when you let me.

30:32.620 --> 30:36.100
You know, and honestly though, it actually was pretty comfortable to play. You know how

30:36.100 --> 30:38.260
some systems just feel kind of out of whack in your hand?

30:38.260 --> 30:39.260
Like the Engage?

30:39.260 --> 30:40.260
It felt pretty comfortable.

30:40.260 --> 30:41.260
I...

30:41.260 --> 30:42.260
Do you mean the taco?

30:42.260 --> 30:46.820
Gizmondo's going to have to wait in line because I still have to pick up a PSP, but I'm interested

30:46.820 --> 30:47.820
in Gizmondo.

30:47.820 --> 30:49.740
Why don't they just call it the Magic Taco Gaming System?

30:49.740 --> 30:51.300
I think it would sell better.

30:51.300 --> 30:52.300
Moving on.

30:52.300 --> 30:53.300
Loki, what's up?

30:53.300 --> 30:54.300
Video Taco!

30:54.300 --> 30:55.300
We love the taco!

30:55.300 --> 30:56.300
Anyway.

30:56.300 --> 30:58.380
Loki, tell us about some hackin' and crackin'.

30:58.380 --> 31:02.140
There's some cool stuff coming out actually for the PSP that you can get.

31:02.140 --> 31:07.560
One of them's actually this group that's a Spanish electronica group called the Overkillers,

31:07.560 --> 31:09.120
And they actually have a download.

31:09.120 --> 31:13.300
Their whole music album is available now for a free PSP download.

31:13.300 --> 31:14.300
And that's kinda cool.

31:14.300 --> 31:20.780
So you can get that and I would say it's probably better to go to psphackers.com and then find

31:20.780 --> 31:23.160
the link because the website's too long.

31:23.160 --> 31:24.240
But anyways, you can get it.

31:24.240 --> 31:28.480
It's like a good 63.6 meg download, so check it out.

31:28.480 --> 31:33.080
There's some, obviously, they're going emulator crazy on the PSP right now.

31:33.080 --> 31:34.080
Actually, I've noticed.

31:34.080 --> 31:35.080
The PSP.

31:35.080 --> 31:37.040
I've seen a lot of gaming blogs over on 1up.com.

31:37.040 --> 31:40.400
are posting pictures of their PSP emulated stuff.

31:40.400 --> 31:47.680
I'm almost tempted to go get a 1.0 version PSP, one of the Japanese first ones, but soon

31:47.680 --> 31:53.800
enough once that 1.5, once they crack that, it's gonna be heaven man. You're gonna have

31:53.800 --> 32:00.120
all the Game Boy Advance games, they actually have Neo Geo emulated on that and that's great.

32:00.120 --> 32:07.240
So yeah, definitely, if you're lucky enough to have one, the brand new version 1.01, definitely

32:07.240 --> 32:10.120
check all this stuff out. Tons of fun stuff for that.

32:10.120 --> 32:15.960
Now if you like more gadget-y junk, they've got the PSP Shuffle, where you can actually,

32:15.960 --> 32:22.000
this program you can download, and it'll actually put random content on your PSP, basically.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.480
That sounds kind of freaky.

32:23.480 --> 32:24.480
It's kind of retarded.

32:24.480 --> 32:25.480
Okay.

32:25.480 --> 32:26.880
You actually have to buy this?

32:26.880 --> 32:27.880
Life is random!

32:27.880 --> 32:29.240
Why would you have to buy this program?

32:29.240 --> 32:30.240
That's retarded.

32:30.240 --> 32:34.560
But anyways, you can buy it if you want to, but honestly, save your time.

32:34.560 --> 32:36.000
There are consumer whores out there.

32:36.000 --> 32:40.180
I mean, if you want to be random, I'm never having a problem figuring out what I can put

32:40.180 --> 32:41.180
on my PSP.

32:41.180 --> 32:44.080
If you want to be random, put a dollar in an envelope and send it to me.

32:44.080 --> 32:48.040
Honestly, that would be pretty random, and then I would have money.

32:48.040 --> 32:50.600
But yeah, that's some cool stuff coming out.

32:50.600 --> 32:52.400
Now I know that there's been some more stuff.

32:52.400 --> 33:00.240
I was watching the whole DS Linux, the whole thing going on with that, and they actually

33:00.240 --> 33:03.040
have some progress on that, and it looks pretty cool.

33:03.040 --> 33:08.400
They've got on the modgods.com, and it's a site that carries a bunch of information about

33:08.400 --> 33:20.420
DS hacking, and they actually have DS Hacker.com they actually released, but they've got a

33:20.420 --> 33:31.180
whole thing, they're showing pictures of the new version of Linux that's running on the

33:31.180 --> 33:39.380
DS, and it actually has a picture of the Linux penguin with the Mario hat on it, which I

33:39.380 --> 33:42.780
thought was pretty cute.

33:42.780 --> 33:49.860
So it's coming along pretty soon, and you can actually download a copy of it, the Dualist

33:49.860 --> 33:56.860
DS emulator. Oh, that's an emulator for DS. Well, check that out too. But a bunch of cool

33:56.860 --> 34:02.900
stuff. And for my final thing to leave you guys with, actually two things. Under the

34:02.900 --> 34:06.340
Knife looks awesome, because I want to cut up people just for the hell of it.

34:06.340 --> 34:09.740
I completely missed this game at E3 and everybody's talking about it.

34:09.740 --> 34:12.100
Under the Knife, there's an old game called like...

34:12.100 --> 34:13.100
Operation?

34:13.100 --> 34:14.980
No, not Operation. Life and Death.

34:14.980 --> 34:17.760
Oh, shit! I remember that game.

34:17.760 --> 34:27.760
All you would do is appendix surgery, but now under the knife you can relive the wonderful

34:27.760 --> 34:28.760
doctor things.

34:28.760 --> 34:32.440
There's a little error thing on there which you can do, but you basically cut people open

34:32.440 --> 34:33.440
and fix them.

34:33.440 --> 34:35.680
It's quite interesting.

34:35.680 --> 34:41.160
When that comes out here, which is going to be in the winter of 2005, check it out.

34:41.160 --> 34:44.440
Then they have this really weird one, and I don't know what the hell this is.

34:44.440 --> 34:47.480
It's Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney.

34:47.480 --> 34:50.540
That sounds quite boring, but actually I saw a preview for that.

34:50.540 --> 34:51.540
It looked kind of funny.

34:51.540 --> 34:52.540
I want to play that.

34:52.540 --> 34:53.540
It looked kind of funny.

34:53.540 --> 34:54.540
You'd be surprised.

34:54.540 --> 34:55.540
That's why I got my alley.

34:55.540 --> 34:56.540
A couple other things.

34:56.540 --> 34:58.780
The DS, more colors, pink and red.

34:58.780 --> 35:03.340
So now you've got red that's going to be coming out for Jump Superstars, which I don't know

35:03.340 --> 35:04.340
is another game.

35:04.340 --> 35:05.340
And that's here in America?

35:05.340 --> 35:06.340
No, no, no, no.

35:06.340 --> 35:07.340
It's in Japan.

35:07.340 --> 35:10.900
Yeah, I need to import the graphite one because the graphite one is all shiny black.

35:10.900 --> 35:15.420
So yeah, those are going to be coming out and definitely check out the brand new screens

35:15.420 --> 35:22.420
for the Linux because it'll be awesome.

35:45.420 --> 35:50.660
that's awful. Remember Monochrome Green? How did we live? I don't know. Honestly. Oregon

35:50.660 --> 35:54.380
Trail, that's how we made it. Alright, a couple more stories. Let's talk about what's going

35:54.380 --> 36:01.020
on in some MMO's worlds right now. Not technically an MMO, okay. Warcraft 3, more of a head to

36:01.020 --> 36:11.460
head game. Blizzard closed over 53,000 battle.net accounts on Warcraft 3. Basically, they were

36:11.460 --> 36:16.540
closed because they were hacking or cheating during a multiplayer session.

36:16.540 --> 36:19.300
Some of them were just banned for ladder play from a month.

36:19.300 --> 36:22.780
Some were permanently removed, crazy.

36:22.780 --> 36:27.620
So man, don't mess with those battle net.

36:27.620 --> 36:31.160
Don't mess with your games because they'll get you.

36:31.160 --> 36:37.800
And one of the granddad, now this is as old school as MMOs get here, Ultima Online.

36:37.800 --> 36:39.900
Do we know anybody that still plays Ultima Online?

36:39.900 --> 36:40.900
Yes.

36:40.900 --> 36:45.860
I don't know anybody that still plays this, but that's cool. Ultima Online is getting another

36:45.860 --> 36:49.340
expansion. It's called Mondane's Legacy.

36:49.340 --> 36:53.340
You know that game's been out for eight years now? Mondane or Mundane?

36:53.340 --> 36:56.860
Mondane. I know.

36:56.860 --> 37:00.440
You would think after eight years. August 30th is the release of this game.

37:00.440 --> 37:03.860
If you want a free trial of Ultima Online, see what you might be missing,

37:03.860 --> 37:07.540
don't make fun until you've played it. I have played it. UO.com.

37:07.540 --> 37:09.860
I still know people who are freaking playing Asheron's Call.

37:09.860 --> 37:12.860
Why? That's not so surprising, but Ultimate Online.

37:12.860 --> 37:17.860
The only thing I remember from Ultimate Online, because you'd have, like,

37:17.860 --> 37:21.860
you can buy your own house, is people would put their horses in the house so it wouldn't get stolen.

37:21.860 --> 37:24.860
Yeah. It builds like a stable room.

37:24.860 --> 37:26.860
No, it's just a house.

37:26.860 --> 37:28.860
No, no, I've seen them. I've played Asheron's Call.

37:28.860 --> 37:31.860
And they would just call it a stable room.

37:31.860 --> 37:35.860
I like the trophy rooms and stuff, where you keep your portals and shit.

37:35.860 --> 37:39.740
Miyamoto made a very interesting comment this week in a

37:39.740 --> 37:43.460
article on CNN Money. He said

37:43.460 --> 37:47.240
there's not a lot I want to play now. A lot of the games out there are just too

37:47.240 --> 37:47.900
long.

37:47.900 --> 37:51.340
Of course there are games such as Halo or Grand Theft Auto that are big and

37:51.340 --> 37:52.220
expansive

37:52.220 --> 37:55.460
but if you're not interested in spending that time with them you're not gonna

37:55.460 --> 37:56.140
play.

37:56.140 --> 37:59.500
Interesting. You think games are too long these days?

37:59.500 --> 38:04.420
Miyamoto's got a point? There need to be more, you know, quick play fun games.

38:04.420 --> 38:10.040
But see the thing is with Grand Theft Auto though that is a quick play fun game same with Halo 2 actually because you can

38:10.040 --> 38:13.600
Go and play multiplayer games. It's fun Grand Theft Auto. You don't even have to play the game

38:13.600 --> 38:18.420
You just run around exist in the world and it's fun. And that's the whole point. That's why I love that game

38:18.420 --> 38:20.420
That's why I can take Grand Theft Auto

38:20.920 --> 38:25.760
Not play it for like a year and come back to it and still have fun in it and just be able to pick it

38:25.760 --> 38:31.580
Right up again or even just be able to play it for weeks at a time because it's you can find little fun things to do

38:31.580 --> 38:37.520
it. Maybe that's the problem, the fact that there is so much you can do with it, instead

38:37.520 --> 38:44.020
of having something just simple, to the point. But you know what, don't buy it then. I don't

38:44.020 --> 38:48.900
buy it, I think it's kind of crap, but you know, I like my puzzle games and I like my

38:48.900 --> 38:54.900
cute RPGs. Maybe this is a hint as to what the revolution is. After 15 minutes, the revolution

38:54.900 --> 38:57.700
shuts off and tells you to go outside, Fatty.

38:57.700 --> 39:03.620
It's one of those old Nintendo demo machines.

39:03.620 --> 39:07.220
Nintendo has always had, though, a family-oriented point of view.

39:07.220 --> 39:11.820
I mean, we have had the fair share of violent games, but for the most part, Nintendo has

39:11.820 --> 39:17.460
been, you know, they have brought out things that are kid-friendly, family-safe, you know,

39:17.460 --> 39:18.580
that type of thing.

39:18.580 --> 39:21.740
Nintendo only started getting a little more violent with that stuff, though, after they

39:21.740 --> 39:25.740
were publicly embarrassed with Mortal Kombat's sweat thing. I mean, that was the laughing

39:25.740 --> 39:26.740
stock at the time.

39:26.740 --> 39:27.740
Yeah.

39:27.740 --> 39:28.740
Alright.

39:28.740 --> 39:33.940
Yeah, if you put in the blood code on Mortal Kombat 2, it would change some of the fatalities.

39:33.940 --> 39:37.980
One more opinion piece. This was something that was posted over on Slashdot, which I

39:37.980 --> 39:45.020
think was just a repeat of something from CNET, but they were predicting on CNET that

39:45.020 --> 39:52.120
The next generation consoles will kill off PC gaming.

39:52.120 --> 39:56.640
The bottom line is that console manufacturers often heavily subsidize their new machines

39:56.640 --> 40:04.880
swallowing huge losses up front in hopes that they'll make it all back selling games, which

40:04.880 --> 40:11.160
is to say that once the 18-34 demographic starts buying $400 PS3s instead of $400 video

40:11.160 --> 40:14.200
cards, developers may have no choice but to follow suit.

40:14.200 --> 40:15.880
Agree disagree

40:15.880 --> 40:21.720
Now the PC market is still gonna go and then honestly, I really think that the whole PC gaming market

40:21.720 --> 40:23.720
It's gonna be dominated by the MMO

40:24.320 --> 40:29.600
The more of them that come out the more addicts there are going to be and the more people who are going to upgrade their

40:29.600 --> 40:33.920
machine, you know, even I bought a new graphics card so I could play Final Fantasy 11 and

40:35.120 --> 40:37.600
Now it makes PSO look so beautiful

40:38.980 --> 40:40.600
You know still

40:40.600 --> 40:45.600
You'll be able to play Final Fantasy, you can already play Final Fantasy 11 on a console, and then Xbox 360 is going to get it too.

40:45.600 --> 40:47.600
But it looks like shit on the console.

40:47.600 --> 40:50.600
Well, the Xbox 360 is going to be nice, you've got to give it that.

40:50.600 --> 40:55.600
Yeah, but you can still always build a PC that's going to kick its ass.

40:55.600 --> 41:05.600
I just think that as the consoles evolve, the PCs evolve too, so I think there will always be a place for PC games. I mean, I don't know.

41:05.600 --> 41:10.980
You pull your console out of the box, six weeks later your computer technology is going

41:10.980 --> 41:12.860
to make it obsolete.

41:12.860 --> 41:14.700
It's already obsolete.

41:14.700 --> 41:21.500
You can build computers that use the cell structure processors.

41:21.500 --> 41:22.500
They have them.

41:22.500 --> 41:23.500
They've been having them.

41:23.500 --> 41:25.900
They've been out for, what, a year now?

41:25.900 --> 41:26.900
The cell processors?

41:26.900 --> 41:27.900
Yeah.

41:27.900 --> 41:33.560
Yeah, they've been marketing them for all kinds of science research.

41:33.560 --> 41:35.920
I think what the article tries to say is that this kind of stuff is too

41:35.920 --> 41:40.240
expensive for most of us but the game consoles make them affordable

41:40.240 --> 41:45.720
I think. Yeah, you buy the package deal but there are still going to be

41:45.720 --> 41:49.600
the hardcore PC people who are going to keep it alive and the fact that the

41:49.600 --> 41:53.120
pieces are so expensive is just more fuel.

41:53.120 --> 41:58.560
And just right now you can't play Xbox Live and be on IRC at the same time.

41:58.560 --> 42:02.680
Nope. I cannot do my homework playing PSO on the Xbox.

42:02.680 --> 42:06.560
Now, who's to say that that won't change in the future with what all these next-gen systems

42:06.560 --> 42:07.560
want to do?

42:07.560 --> 42:08.560
But I don't know.

42:08.560 --> 42:09.560
Loke, you have another thought on this?

42:09.560 --> 42:12.320
It's never going to kill it off because if you're spending $400 on a graphics card, you're

42:12.320 --> 42:15.120
especially kind of crazy anyway, so it's not going to matter.

42:15.120 --> 42:18.240
I mean, honestly, who spends $400 on a graphics card?

42:18.240 --> 42:19.240
I mean...

42:19.240 --> 42:20.960
If you're going to spend that kind of money buying Alienware...

42:20.960 --> 42:23.240
Oh, big man buys a high-end graphics card.

42:23.240 --> 42:24.240
Guess what?

42:24.240 --> 42:29.720
Next week, it's obsolete and my $20 graphics card is still whatever.

42:29.720 --> 42:33.360
The whole thing is is you really don't need to spend all this money on console games.

42:33.360 --> 42:36.060
People that are playing console games are going to still be playing console games and

42:36.060 --> 42:40.240
people that are playing the PC games, you know what, because the PCs now, they're still

42:40.240 --> 42:43.200
going to get better, the graphics here are going to get better, and it's still going

42:43.200 --> 42:45.000
to be one step ahead of the console systems.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.900
The console systems will get closer but whatever.

42:47.900 --> 42:50.040
I play all of them, I don't care.

42:50.040 --> 42:51.640
I've got them, I play them.

42:51.640 --> 42:54.480
But you're also a special kind of crazy dark Sakura.

42:54.480 --> 43:02.860
Okay, emulators are one thing, but I have to have the stupid half-broken joystick in

43:02.860 --> 43:10.120
my hand so I can play Kix on my Atari 5200 and play it right, god damn it.

43:10.120 --> 43:13.980
Alright, one last, we're running kind of long, but one last story.

43:13.980 --> 43:16.240
Something to make Dark Sakura squeal a little bit here.

43:16.240 --> 43:17.240
You're a fan of Stargate, yes?

43:17.240 --> 43:18.240
Yes.

43:18.240 --> 43:21.400
Well, you know how there's the Stargate SG-1 game coming out, right?

43:21.400 --> 43:22.400
Yes.

43:22.400 --> 43:27.200
Richard Dean Anderson, Michael Shanks, Amanda Tappe and Christopher Judge, that's

43:27.200 --> 43:28.340
right, some of the cast,

43:28.340 --> 43:32.960
they will be doing the voice acting for the game. I didn't doubt it. I played some of it at E3.

43:32.960 --> 43:36.800
Very cool. It's definitely very first-person shooter-y, but

43:36.800 --> 43:41.040
they got them looking right. And you know, though, a bit of trivia.

43:41.040 --> 43:45.160
You know Richard Dean Anderson was MacGyver.

43:45.160 --> 43:48.800
Oh yeah. But Dude was also

43:48.800 --> 43:54.200
in a few episodes of MacGyver 2. July is the release date for that game, so you kids

43:54.200 --> 43:54.960
look for it.

43:54.960 --> 43:58.820
That's gonna bring another additional Orange Lounge Radio to go to a close. Final

43:58.820 --> 43:59.680
thoughts, Loki?

43:59.680 --> 44:03.720
I have my headache still, it needs to go away,

44:03.720 --> 44:07.240
and I loaned out Grand Theft Auto San Andreas,

44:07.240 --> 44:14.160
what was I thinking? Dark Sakura. Reject, false icons, and happy birthday to the old man.

44:14.160 --> 44:18.280
And my final thought is

44:18.280 --> 44:22.140
My birthday is coming up very soon and I hope you're all going to get me something lovely.

44:22.140 --> 44:29.320
My second final thought is vote for us on Podcast Alley.

44:29.320 --> 44:32.320
Go there now.

44:32.320 --> 44:33.320
Don't hesitate.

44:33.320 --> 44:36.340
Go there now because if you vote us, we get better.

44:36.340 --> 44:38.920
Don't you feel like it's running for student council though?

44:38.920 --> 44:39.920
No, no, no.

44:39.920 --> 44:44.360
They need to vote for us so that my ego can inflate to astronomical proportions.

44:44.360 --> 44:46.080
You need to go now.

44:46.080 --> 44:51.160
Sally, honestly, go vote for us. Do it. And vote every month. Don't just vote once, vote

44:51.160 --> 44:54.760
every month. I, your favorite internet celebrity, beseeches

44:54.760 --> 44:56.800
you. Vote!

44:56.800 --> 45:01.320
Vote or die! Vote or die!

45:01.320 --> 45:06.640
As P. Diddy says, vote or die. Alright, have a good one you guys, we'll see you next time

45:06.640 --> 45:08.640
on the Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

45:08.640 --> 45:15.080
That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition. This podcast is a proud

45:15.080 --> 45:22.080
part of www.orangeloungeradio.com. See you next update!
