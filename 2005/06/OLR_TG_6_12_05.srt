21
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,360
name is Rob Roberts, of course, also known as Sky. We're here to talk about games

22
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:54,200
And we're gonna start off tonight's edition as we always do talking about the games that we've been playing this week dark Sakura

23
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,200
How about you?

24
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,880
um

25
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,260
Fantasy star online blue burst the beta is over, right? Yes

26
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:07,240
I've actually to the beta will be over as of tomorrow. So it goes pay to play and I will be

27
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,500
Registering my account and canceling my xbox one. I

28
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:16,320
Will probably be canceling the Xbox one too. I'm considering starting it on the PC, but I'm kind of on the fence

29
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:21,200
I had a lot of fun with the beta, but I just feel like do I really want to commit to the demo?

30
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,840
I kind of want us one of us

31
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:30,080
I wish I wish more folks to be taking that Guild Wars model or just gouge me for 50 bucks when I buy the game

32
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,760
Then don't charge me to pay per month anymore

33
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,880
But I guess I don't know I think Guild Wars have been doing very successful for that reason

34
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,480
But I guess other companies don't want to follow suit. I don't know

35
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,320
Well, I've also been watching Dan play a lot of Fire Emblem. Lots of Fire Emblem.

36
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:52,680
Which one? The sec- well, okay. It's hard for me to think of the second release in

37
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,160
the States as the second one because it's technically the third one on the

38
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:03,160
Game Boy Advance. The first one was the one that Marth and Roy were from, even if

39
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,920
you ever played Smash Bros. Oh yeah, I know Marth and Roy. But we never got that game.

40
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,720
hmm well Dan found a ROM of it and I found him an English patch for it so he's

41
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,400
been quite happy playing through that and getting his fire emblem on and

42
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,940
seeing I like seeing how the games all connect and you know honestly I'm

43
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,920
thinking about starting to play it I hate turn-based strategy but I would

44
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,800
play this fire emblems game I never really got into I just need to give it a

45
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,300
second look I think I don't know I just I don't know why one of the rarest games

46
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:34,240
I own is the macross strategy game on the turbo graphics or the PC Engine duo

47
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,200
Oh, and I hate that game. I hate it. I just have it cuz it's hard to get

48
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,720
Seriously, well, you have night trap right and that game sucks. Well, yeah, but night trap you can find anywhere

49
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,720
Oh, I thought that was a rare one. Oh

50
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,140
You find it and they say it's very blah blah blah. I'm not much of a cuz what's your face from the fat from?

51
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,920
Different strokes she died. Yeah, she killed herself. Did she she OD'd

52
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,960
after being in night trap

53
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,800
I'd slip my eyes be nice. I remember down the block not across the street

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,080
If I were in night trap, I would do it if I were desperate enough to be a night trap

55
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,260
Wow

56
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,520
Okay, not really. I'd be like, okay. I have money

57
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,460
It's better than porn. Yeah, I was stupid for the stupid game could be worse could be born anything else you've been playing

58
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:38,460
Only the games on the Gorillaz webpage. I've been playing with the darts at the toilet.

59
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,900
You know what, we'll come back to web games in a minute. Loki, what have you been playing

60
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,900
this week?

61
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:48,980
I played a little bit, very briefly, of Tetris Worlds for the Game Boy Advance, and it's

62
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:54,480
It's Tetris in eight different forms or seven different forms, all of which are just too

63
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,660
damn similar.

64
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,320
So Tetris is Tetris.

65
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,820
And then I played WarioWare Twisted, actually I played WarioWare Twisted about five minutes

66
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:08,180
ago, so it's fun and it has a bunch of weird, stupid minigames in it that are just fun and

67
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,660
just strange, like you can grate cake.

68
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,660
Like you grate cheese.

69
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,120
Is that an actual minigame or is that one of the things you unlock?

70
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,260
It's one of the things you unlock.

71
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,980
like a little toy, and then they have, um, it's just a bunch of whole fun stuff you can

72
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:25,060
do, and since WarioWare Twisted actually has a gyroscope built into the bottom of it, you

73
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:30,100
can actually, most of the game is played using the A button and tilting your Game Boy Advance

74
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,980
or Nintendo DS.

75
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,560
What do you think of this game compared to WarioWare Touched?

76
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,560
I haven't played WarioWare Touched.

77
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,560
Oh, I thought you had.

78
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,560
I need to pick it up, though.

79
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,920
I thought about picking it up and I need to go do that.

80
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,860
You know, most people I've talked to that have played all the games say that, uh, Twisted

81
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,420
Twisted is the best, Touched is the worst, with the first one being in the middle somewhere,

82
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,420
so...

83
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,420
Well, I most...

84
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:57,080
Let me just put it this way, Warrior Warrior Twisted is a very short game.

85
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,740
Most of the Warrior Warrior games are, though.

86
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,460
It's a very short game at the very end, but like, the last level's hard, because you only

87
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:07,300
have one life, and all the games get very hard on you all of a sudden, and so, you know...

88
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,900
But I saw your cartridge, you don't have very many unlocks yet, so...

89
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,860
Yeah, but see, here's the thing, though, is every time I play the game and I get up to

90
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,340
like stage nine or whatever you get an unlock every time so I can keep playing

91
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:22,780
the same stage over and over and I can just get unlocks that way but uh yeah

92
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,460
the thing is so is because Nellie was playing some of the older stages so she

93
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,860
was unlocking games I didn't have before so I go and play my game also there's

94
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:34,780
these games like what the hell do I have to do here yes it was funny a lot of fun

95
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:41,300
though anything else um Final Fantasy 11 a little bit I got to play that I'm

96
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,460
still wish they'd fixed their server problem, whatever it is, because it like

97
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,940
almost the same time every day. Do you think that that's now becoming the

98
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:53,300
scapegoat for all their problems? The DOS attacks is now like the scapegoat? I don't

99
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,500
even know if that's the case it's just something because when their server

100
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,940
crashes it's like everything like you can't get in their lobby you can't it's

101
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:07,180
like their complete servers all of them go down or something. Yesterday's though

102
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:12,200
So the lobby didn't go down but I couldn't log back in or it was allowing me to log in

103
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,400
but it was trying to load the level and it couldn't load anything so I just backed out

104
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,000
of it.

105
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,800
But I don't know what the problem is and I know that it stopped me from playing a few

106
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:27,800
times and it's always around the same time usually around 11pmish around there is when

107
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
it stops.

108
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,960
Which is great because right before that happened Nelly was bitching at me about, Nelly my fiance,

109
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,600
bitching at me how I was playing... Not the rapper. No, not the rapper. She was saying

110
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:45,320
how I was playing this stupid game and stuff and how I should, you know, come pay attention

111
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:50,160
to her or something and then the game, you know, started crashing on me. I'm like...

112
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,980
Are you sure she just didn't pull the plug? Oh, I'm positive, because my cable modem...

113
00:07:53,980 --> 00:08:00,180
My cable modem is right on my desk. It's a DOF attack, Denial of Fiance. No, no, no.

114
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:05,900
The game, she was just being cranky, I mean, she's just like-

115
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,900
Typical- Nevermind, they're not your sessions.

116
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,900
Yeah, seriously, typical-

117
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,900
I have a ferret!

118
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,900
Typical woman, she's like- I don't wanna-

119
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,900
I didn't say it, I didn't say it.

120
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,900
She says, she's like-

121
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,780
Okay, this shit doesn't happen in my house.

122
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,700
I don't wanna go outside, but I don't wanna stay inside.

123
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,380
Well there's no, there's no in between, you can't not go outside and not stay inside.

124
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,380
Tell her to go sit in the doorway.

125
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,380
Patio.

126
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,660
This shit does not happen in my house!

127
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:34,660
It's like, get your ass off the PS2 because I want to play fucking Silent Hill.

128
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:38,140
Yeah, it's never that. I mean, it's just like...

129
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,580
Tell her to take up smoking. She's been doing cross-stitch.

130
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,460
So, you know, more power to her. Alright.

131
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:49,540
MyGamingWeek, I also checked out WarioWare Twisted for a little bit

132
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,960
just because I had to play the Kid Icarus stage, okay? Because,

133
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,080
damn that's a game they need to bring back. Why? It's been how many years?

134
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,200
Why have they not brought that game back? I'm so upset but

135
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,640
they tease us in WarioWare Twisted with a level inspired by Kid O'Grith.

136
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,920
They have the boss battle for the retro games

137
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,440
is you're playing Super Mario Brothers but it's like

138
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,240
around the world. Yeah, it's kinda cool. I like that.

139
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,520
I got that far. I got to see that. So that was kinda cool.

140
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,720
I like the game. It's neat. I'm gonna have to pick it up and check it out for myself.

141
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,020
I didn't run out and get this the day it came out though because I was

142
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,520
kind of disappointed in the long run with Touched.

143
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,120
None of the unlocks were really that great but I'm kind of impressed with some

144
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,760
of the things I'm seeing in Twisted so far.

145
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,200
I like that they have a lot more than minigames. I played the apple shooter or

146
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,920
whatever that thing was. That's a lot of fun. That was kind of funny, I like that.

147
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,400
And also like they have this sheep counting one that's pretty hard because they

148
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,520
Oh man, it pissed me off yesterday. I was like getting really far in it. All of a sudden the sheep stop

149
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,320
and then they run really fast and they run into the wall and then you're fucked.

150
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,520
And then they have, like, another one that's ski jumping that's pretty fun, and then, um...

151
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,820
uh, Space Boomerang, which is just strange.

152
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,820
Wow. Crazy.

153
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,120
I...

154
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,820
I have to play this if you get to murder sheep.

155
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,420
It's like, like in Lemmings, right?

156
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,020
Well, you don't get to murder sheep that you're not trying to murder sheep,

157
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,820
it's just that they smash into the wall and then you get sheep, like, uh...

158
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,020
That just reminds me of a commercial.

159
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,120
But you get to great cakes, DarkCyber, you get to great them.

160
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,920
And carrots!

161
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,100
This reminds me of a commercial that I saw today, Dan went on the classic video game

162
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:31,220
commercial website and they had one for a football game, as in soccer, of this old man

163
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,900
lecturing his dog on, you know, don't let the sheep make fun of you, go out and get

164
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,660
them, and so the dog's herding him in here, crowd cheering like it's playing with a goal

165
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,540
and everything and he's herding the sheep, but that's what that made me think of.

166
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:48,920
There's also a love tester on here, it's two players, it's a compatibility tester, it's

167
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,260
quite funny because you know Nellie didn't get it so we scored like an 18

168
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:58,620
out of 100 because she didn't she's like she's like I wasn't reading the stream

169
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,780
like you're supposed to be paying attention yes this this is this marriage is gonna be

170
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:06,820
happily ever after of course she wasn't paying attention as usual never pays

171
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:11,060
attention to me I hope she doesn't figure out how to download bodcast right

172
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:20,620
I'm going to give you advice on how to deal with women and this could be for

173
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:27,220
anybody out there listening smile and nod and then ask forgiveness later and

174
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:37,820
this is coming from a woman smile or not learn the fine art of filtering when you

175
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:44,100
start to hear the pitch rise just a little bit so you know why don't we just

176
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,380
take a moment and sit down and talk about this can we can we get away from

177
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:52,580
the women are from Venus and men are Mars chat for a minute I got it because

178
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:58,300
I will I will totally admit that we're from like the moon if I Venus you've

179
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:04,580
been crazy town yeah all right stop enough no I'm as a woman yes I can

180
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:09,580
vouch for this, we're nuts. But so are men, because men are stupid. Sorry.

181
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,580
Stop. I'm willing to live with that.

182
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:16,420
Stop. Alright, anyway, nah, games. I'm gonna make you wrestle this out or something. You're

183
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,460
gonna have a rumble roses battle to figure this one out.

184
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:23,420
I love my games are in a box! Alright, anyway, games. The other games I've

185
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:27,980
been playing this week, I don't know why, but I've been getting into the PopCap games,

186
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,900
which is kind of the laughing stock of the game world, I think, in some respects. But

187
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,740
You've all been addicted to one at some point.

188
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:37,360
Tell me you did not play Bejeweled when it first came out and thought it was cool in

189
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,360
San Aquarium.

190
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,480
Bejeweled is a piece of shit.

191
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,480
I can say without a doubt that I have never played any Pop Camp games ever.

192
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,480
I had Neopets.

193
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,400
Okay, well that's laughable, so I feel better.

194
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,660
I was very, very good at that bullshit game they had on there.

195
00:12:54,660 --> 00:13:01,140
I don't know why, but I've just been all about playing like Zuma and like all the games that

196
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:07,200
are on there at san aquarium I love that game it's awesome anyway I know I feel

197
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,840
like I'm letting everybody down by admitting that I play popcap games

198
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,840
because they're the same games that like the you know 50 something year old women

199
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,860
I work with play on their breaks is that like bookworm is that like Apple saying

200
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,960
you know we're gonna put Intel processors in our PCs now we're letting

201
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:30,000
you down oh well all right anyway let's move on to some more gaming news we

202
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,680
want to do a follow-up to a gaming story we were talking about a couple weeks ago

203
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,080
the gaming actors you might remember they were threatening to go on strike

204
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,000
this would have to do with the voice actors they did vote and actually a

205
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,440
majority voted to strike but they needed to have a super majority in order to in

206
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,280
order to strike two-thirds and they did not achieve that just no ordinary

207
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:56,160
majority will do we need super maturity so basically right now is that even a

208
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,760
real concept or is that just saying we don't really care what you think. I don't

209
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,560
know but anyway this is the contract it's now going to be good through the

210
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:08,920
end of 2008 it will grant the voice actors an increase in pay up to 36%

211
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,880
through the duration of the contract the first raise which will be a 25% hike

212
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,520
goes into effect July 1st if you're curious how much they make right now the

213
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:23,720
minimum rate for a four hour voice acting session $556 so that's going up by

214
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:28,280
25 percent. I'm gonna be a voice actor now. One thing that the voice actors didn't get

215
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,440
was the residuals. You might remember that this was a big thing they were pushing for

216
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,200
was they want to get, if the game's successful, they want a chunk of the profits because the

217
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,720
actors feel that they contribute to that, so they wanted that. They did not get that.

218
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:44,000
They only got the pay raise. So, well, at least it's something, huh? So, luckily that's

219
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,480
all settled so you'll continue to hear voices of famous people in your games. The reason

220
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,900
that they didn't have a majority is because the voice actors were striking, so therefore

221
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:58,140
they weren't speaking and so therefore when it's all in favor of you know

222
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:03,700
striking say I you are a dumbass all right moving on to a follow-up from

223
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,820
another story we did a couple weeks ago a couple months ago at this point can

224
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,140
you believe we've been doing this crap that long

225
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,940
GameStop and EB you might remember it was announced they're gonna merge into

226
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:19,260
this powerhouse gaming store but remember as we said to sum it up GameStop

227
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:24,100
and EB were not each other's competition the real competition Walmart Target so

228
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:30,120
now they're joining forces the merger was okayed by the federal government so

229
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,260
it's a done deal it will happen so those of you guys that maybe work for one or

230
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:38,380
the other that were a little bit nervous about teaming up with the enemy sorry

231
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:41,980
it's it's a done deal dude they're the same store already I mean it's just like

232
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:47,140
you can literally put like a GameStop sign out from EB and it would look just

233
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:51,100
Well, you know one thing one thing that you may not realize is that and this is something I learned today

234
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,500
Is that they advertise match?

235
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,420
So if EB's running an ad GameStop will match that and now granted this would be you know

236
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:01,280
Some stores may not go for this but most stores are gonna do this any you know

237
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,280
Store that wants to stay in business will do the ad matching so you can even take in an ad from EB games to a

238
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,280
GameStop and you know

239
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,540
Get whatever but I would probably have to be one within the same town

240
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,540
I'm sure there are laws don't take my word for it

241
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:17,360
it asking GameStop or an EB manager if you're curious for more details on their

242
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,720
policies but I'm just trying to say that they can you know they're already one

243
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,480
store when you have that policy right and they are ruining these games new

244
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,760
games all the systems engage setups in both stores I don't know why engage

245
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:36,720
games going in the discount bin the engage is gone from Dan store I actually

246
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,840
overheard a guy in a one of the store I was at one of the other store today and

247
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:45,360
and actually overheard a guy asking for help on the Engage tech support and I

248
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,440
just felt like walking by going dude just throw it away

249
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,440
stop wasting your time. The taco of doom

250
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,320
it was just sad walking through E3 and seeing what a big beautiful setup they had

251
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:00,000
and all of five people there including us as we were passing through it

252
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,080
I was trying not to make any sub movements in case if any of the Engage Arena staff

253
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:06,800
might see me

254
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:13,000
someone's interested get him I thought someone was heading to me I'm like dude

255
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,540
it only took me I swear to you 30 seconds of playing civilization on the

256
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:23,300
engage because I just had civilization is one of my probably a naughty and keep

257
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,620
in mind I was addicted to Final Fantasy 11 for two and a half years civilization

258
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:30,620
I was addicted to for a longer period and I absolutely love that game is my

259
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:35,540
favorite PC game of all time so I had to see what happened to it on the engage

260
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,460
30 seconds or less, there was a guy over. Do you have any questions?

261
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:42,660
Yeah, how do I do anything on this game?

262
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,700
I cannot figure anything out. Why does it suck so bad?

263
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:51,380
I laughed. You know what's weird though? This game is making my stomach lighting bleed.

264
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:55,440
Love Civilization 1 never got into Civ 2 or 3, even though most people consider

265
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,900
Civ 2 as the peak of the series.

266
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,300
I never got into Civ 2 or 3, don't know why. But I'm still curious about Civ 4.

267
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:05,260
Another follow-up story, lots and lots of follow-up stories tonight. Nintendo

268
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:08,900
you might remember that there was this rumor going around about the revolution

269
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:13,020
where they're going to be doing the downloadable games. That hasn't changed.

270
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,220
They're still going to be offering the retro games for download in the library.

271
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:21,180
No real specifics. But what did happen is that in an interview in Famitsu magazine,

272
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:27,180
Nintendo president Satoru Iwata says, you guys are making up rumors out there.

273
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:30,660
We never said this was going to be free. Oops!

274
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,100
Let me try to find the exact quote here. The exact quote is

275
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,740
baseless rumor is the exact quote there

276
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,060
the internet discussions going on were a baseless rumor so

277
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:45,660
it seems kind of obvious that Nintendo would charge for this.

278
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,260
You know correct that. Basically they've never said that it was free anyways.

279
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,440
They said some

280
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,900
might be free. You know obviously it's not going to

281
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,420
all be free because you know let's just not make any money from re-releasing our games

282
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,100
fifty times like we do all the time.

283
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:05,260
You know I I kind of found it hard to believe too that when you are releasing these classic Nintendo games such as you know

284
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,820
Metroid

285
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:13,020
Even though you can unlock Metroid through two other Metroid games either Metroid zero mission or the Metroid prime

286
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,140
fusion link up

287
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:20,740
They were charging $20 for this separately. I kind of found it hard to believe that suddenly this game would be free on the revolution

288
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,020
so

289
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,460
But are people gonna pay $20 for these games

290
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:31,120
I don't think they will or even now if you want to get even crazier than that probably an Animal Crossing DS

291
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:37,040
You've been liking another game. Maybe well. Yeah, maybe maybe we don't know we'll see

292
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,160
Any thoughts dark soccer?

293
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,960
It's it's why I try not to speculate on systems cuz usually it's gonna come back and shoot you in the ass

294
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,080
Well, we got a lot of that going on with the next-gen wars heating up here. So

295
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,880
Something to get used to speaking of war

296
00:19:52,880 --> 00:20:00,200
very interesting story out of China going on you might have heard about this

297
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,960
online but there was actually a fight that broke out between two individuals

298
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:13,360
in China over a virtual sword and this one Chinese guy and I will horribly

299
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,240
pronounce this I apologize Qiyi Chengwei was the guy that attacked

300
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:26,320
Xu Kalyan and murdered him basically over a dispute over an online sword and

301
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:33,040
the parents are upset. Cui received a suspended death sentence for this attack.

302
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:39,280
The virtual sword was sold to another gamer basically was a dispute like that

303
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,800
the sword was stolen. The sword was stolen I guess just allegedly and

304
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:49,240
then sold to another gamer for seven thousand two hundred yuan and that's six

305
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:54,560
hundred dollars United States money so six hundred dollar sword got murdered

306
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:59,880
over like a cracking club in Final Fantasy 11 it's about would you murder

307
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,800
someone over a cracking club though that's insane come on you got to draw

308
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:08,240
the line somewhere exactly cracking club that's just like you know knees broken I

309
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,740
mean because that's not even you know worth that I mean granted this is a

310
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:16,140
story out of China but the sad thing is I could see this happening here does

311
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:20,740
anyone want to doubt me I don't doubt it at all because people are stupid you

312
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:27,540
know people life allow me to get a little philosophical here please you

313
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:33,380
know we live in a world where things are not the bright beautiful sunshine that

314
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:42,340
you know MTV and Teletubbies wants us to think it is you know I love you but

315
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:49,620
seriously it's not all about pop star drama and reality TV that's an illusion

316
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:53,900
and the thing is is that people are looking you know people understand that

317
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:59,820
we are really living in a pretty dark time right now with all the crap that's

318
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:05,240
going on in the world and even their own lives are so mundane and maybe so

319
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,540
unhappy that people are always looking for a form of escape that's why we watch

320
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:14,120
TV that's why we listen to music that's why we're here honestly we're here to

321
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:20,460
offer that to our listeners but it's the point where you start wanting to escape

322
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:26,180
it to the point where you are totally immersing yourself in fantasy you know

323
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:29,700
that's the point that it's gone on too far when you start losing touch like

324
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:35,080
that that's when you know that's when you start losing it in your head at

325
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:39,000
least there is poetic justice in this world because Britney Spears chaotic is

326
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,960
one of the lowest rated shows on television so at least there is poetic

327
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,000
justice I didn't mean to be down on it but that's all right that's my whole

328
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,320
theory on this whole you know epidemic of people immersing themselves in all

329
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:56,440
these MMOs is the fact that you know basically life sucks let's make some

330
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,440
So you see MMOs as like an escape?

331
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,440
I see it as a form- well, you know, any form of entertainment.

332
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,440
You know what? I'll admit it. To me, Final Fantasy XI, when I was so into it, was a bit of an escape.

333
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,440
But games in general are kind of an escape.

334
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,440
But I don't let it blur the line with the real world.

335
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,440
Exactly.

336
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,440
I realize it's fictional, but unfortunately not everybody has that brain about you.

337
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,440
But Vantage Yield doesn't exist?

338
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,440
Shush.

339
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,440
And I think, though, that it's these people that get too far into it.

340
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,440
Or even, you know, get too far- you know, I have to admit, I'm a pretty rabid, you know, Guerrillas fan,

341
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,160
point where I can't distinguish between reality and not where you think you're

342
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:36,440
gonna marry Murdoch considering he's a cartoon character no but I'm saying you

343
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:41,840
know there's a limit to that you know okay remember in the 80s the screaming

344
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,020
Michael Jackson fans of the woman who thought that she was his wife and had

345
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:50,320
his baby and they locked her up and to this day she still claims to be his wife

346
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:56,080
that is losing yourself that is going to the point of going nutso and that's like

347
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,080
the guy in China they were too far into their game to be able to distinguish it

348
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:06,280
from reality and when you go that far that's it all right if you have any

349
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:11,800
feedback comments I want to give a shout out to Jamie or you want to maybe give

350
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,360
her a question or whatever I look forward to seeing a counterpoint to go

351
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,300
at orange lounge radio.com to go at orange on studio calm we actually added

352
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:23,540
a new section of our website, even over at orangehonored.com that says contact staff.

353
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,900
So if you want to contact any of us, our emails are all right there, as well as the general

354
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,900
address.

355
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:33,220
And I would like to give a shout out to the people I heard from last week, to Jimmy, who

356
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,260
likes our podcast, and Misty's back.

357
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,620
Right on.

358
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,580
And to Robin from PodNova.

359
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,920
Oh, cool, hi.

360
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,100
So hi to all you guys, thanks for writing.

361
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,480
And I'd like to give a shout out to the people that have contacted me.

362
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:54,220
Thank you to VidRx for the wonderful Blue Pill ads, I love those.

363
00:24:54,220 --> 00:25:05,800
And thank you to HotSluts.com for sending me ads and also I have enough free PSP offers

364
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,740
so no thanks for those.

365
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:12,400
By the way, the game in question, because I'm sure you guys are curious, what game was

366
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,400
this?

367
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:18,080
called legend of mere three so not something I've heard of here but it must

368
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,240
be more popular overseas I think I have heard of that one actually not me what

369
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,720
can I say all right I think I think a good follow-up piece would be dark

370
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,200
Sakura's on a roll here so I think she needs to start dishing out her advice

371
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,560
column here because you know we here at orange lounge radio we're not just here

372
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,840
to talk about games all the time because if we talked about games all the time

373
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:41,600
we'd have no time to go sit in the doorway so we are here to better your

374
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,420
life with the advice column because you need to go outside once in a while and who better

375
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,920
than our one and only DarkSakura.

376
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,040
DarkSakura, what are you going to give the kids some advice about tonight?

377
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:55,040
Today's piece of advice is how to survive when lost in the jungle.

378
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,040
Number one.

379
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,040
This is helpful.

380
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,040
Yes.

381
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,040
Number one, find water.

382
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:04,360
If you do not have the means to purify water, cut sections from large water vines or cut

383
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,720
banana trees to capture the water welling out from the stalks.

384
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,240
Only drink water from streams and rivers as a last resort as this water will most likely

385
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:19,560
2. Eat only foods that you can peel or cook. Avoid brightly colored plants or plants with

386
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:23,800
a milky sap. Many of these are poisonous. Insects, grubs, and raw fish, except those

387
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:28,720
with bristles or spines rather than scales, are safe to eat. Peel fruits before eating.

388
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,280
Peels may harbor diarrhea-causing bacteria.

389
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:39,400
final piece of advice yes stay out of brazil unless we might have listeners there be nice

390
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:44,760
unless of course i mean in the jungle don't go to the jungle don't go to the jungle unless

391
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:50,200
you can't you know go and watch out for dinosaurs and bring toilet paper because you might breathe

392
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:59,240
and catch diarrhea be sure not to slip on the diarrhea in the jungle that's more usages of

393
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,160
of the word diarrhea than we have allotted for the show, please.

394
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,920
Loki, did you have some stories you wanted to share with us tonight?

395
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,600
I know you're excited about this PSP hacking thing.

396
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:14,600
Of course, as it's been rumored all week, you know, PSP, you know, everyone's looking

397
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:21,320
for a way to run homebrew applications on version 1.5 PSP.

398
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:26,200
For those not in the know, the version 1.0 PSPs were the very first ones launched in

399
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,160
Japan and all the US ones were version 1.5.

400
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:34,220
So all of us over here, unless you actually import a 1.0 version of PSP, you can't run

401
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:38,000
any of those cool emulators and all that stuff.

402
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:45,180
However, now there's this one website stating, yes, they found a way and they're going to

403
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:51,840
launch it on June 15th, on the 15th hour.

404
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,440
I get it, 1.5, 15.

405
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:04,440
The website only4.info, they have a video on there that's showing a version 1.5 PSP

406
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,440
running...

407
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,440
The number 4 only 4 or only 4?

408
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,880
Only and then the number 4.

409
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,560
All one word.info.

410
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:20,720
They have a video, people are of course saying oh it's fake and people are saying oh it's

411
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,720
real.

412
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,320
I guess you'll find out on Wednesday when this is actually launched.

413
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:32,360
And supposedly they have a tutorial on how to make programs to run in version 1.5.

414
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:38,120
And it only works in version 1.5 because whatever the hole is was fixed in version 1.51.

415
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:44,440
So hopefully you haven't upgraded your PSP to anything above 1.5 because otherwise you're

416
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,440
screwed.

417
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,440
Interesting.

418
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:52,900
know a lot of sense since also they have a brand new some brand new stuff for the

419
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:59,500
PSP homebrew stuff like for example XMAME was released for the PSP and that's

420
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:04,460
MAME for your PSP so you can play all your favorite arcade emulators and then

421
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:12,860
also there's emulators now out for the Gameboy Color, for the Mega Drive, for a

422
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:20,220
Neo Geo Pocket, just tons of stuff out there, and hopefully this will, you know, happen

423
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:24,020
and we'll see this being able to play, you know, these homebrew applications.

424
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:27,180
So when you go to this website on the 15th, either you're going to find the holy grail

425
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:30,820
here of emulation on the PSP, or you're going to find your computer filled with spyware,

426
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:33,060
because this will be a practical joke, I don't know.

427
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,060
No, it's...

428
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,060
I think it sounds pretty legit though.

429
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:38,060
It's going to be, it'll be everywhere on the net if this is the case, because it's going

430
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:41,100
to just be, it's a big thing.

431
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,220
I'm sure you will bring us a full report.

432
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,220
Oh, yes.

433
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:49,860
And also on the other portable end, we have DS.

434
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,740
We have Space Invaders for the DS.

435
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:55,180
And they're actually playing that now.

436
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,660
I believe they're running on Linux,

437
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:01,100
because they have Linux running for the DS right now.

438
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,100
When's it going to be installed on a toaster?

439
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,380
Did you hear this story from earlier this week?

440
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,060
And I don't have the article up in front of me.

441
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,520
For some reason, I forgot to pull it up for tonight's stuff.

442
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,720
PlayStation 3 they're saying will have Linux installed on it by default.

443
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:18,400
PlayStation 3 their hard drives will come with Linux installed on them because they're not being included

444
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,760
but they said that you would be able to install other operating systems such as

445
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,680
Windows

446
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:26,560
and Tiger which would be the Mac OS

447
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:31,120
X whatever. Wow. Why anyone would do that I don't know.

448
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,320
I don't know but supposedly they're gonna have that and I guess if you install

449
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,300
Linux on it you'd have a pretty powerful PC right there because

450
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:42,420
you know cell processing plus you know tons of USB applications you could

451
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,180
probably run

452
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:47,900
you know a keyboard and whatnot off there so who knows what the hell you're going to be there.

453
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:51,100
It feels like that there's something we're missing here. I'm sure we'll get more

454
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,620
details on this in the next video.

455
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:56,060
This all sounds too good to be true. This really does sound too good to be true.

456
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:59,500
Well, coming from the horse's mouth. In other news,

457
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:04,180
let's see here we've got also details that the Nintendo DS

458
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:07,860
outsells the Sony PSP and PlayStation 2 combined

459
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:12,620
in Japan that's actually sold that well and you can probably thank that to Nintendogs

460
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,300
because Nintendogs rocks.

461
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,940
And I think it's going to be a big thing here too.

462
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:22,140
Nintendogs actually has a little epidemic attached to it, sort of catching on the way

463
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:25,060
Pokemon was, you know, the little shaky ones.

464
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:32,100
You know, they're, you know, it's like I was talking to the guy at E3, they'll be, the

465
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:37,780
boys start playing Nintendogs to pick up girls because the girls were all playing it and

466
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,820
and their little puppies would bark at them.

467
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,340
So the boys' doggies would bark back.

468
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,180
This is gonna be very interesting

469
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,260
when this game launches, I'm looking forward to it.

470
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,260
Thank you very much, Loki, for letting us know

471
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,700
what's going on in the hackin' and crackin' world.

472
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,540
DarkSakura, how about what's going on in the UK?

473
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,980
You got a story for the UK for us tonight?

474
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,380
For our friends over there?

475
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,660
I was digging through BBC News,

476
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:00,940
which, you know, I actually look at BBC News every so often.

477
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:03,900
This is something about a Pac-Man virtual reality thing

478
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,660
that they were doing.

479
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:13,020
actually it was the human pac-man was developed at the National University of

480
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:17,660
Singapore by a mixed reality lab and what they were doing they're having it

481
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:21,940
they're using GPS Bluetooth virtual reality Wi-Fi infrared and sensing

482
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:27,380
mechanisms trying to create a virtual world so these people are wearing these

483
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:31,700
hats these goggles and it's actually putting the dots in front of them and

484
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:38,180
they're running the maze now it's pretty cool you know there's a pictures in a

485
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:44,360
little bit more detail on it on the bbc.co.uk under the technology section

486
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:48,980
because these pictures are hard to describe it's really it shows I saw them

487
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:53,340
on another new site this week and it looked kind of weird like I've seen the

488
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:57,500
live pac-man games I remember seeing it on the internet previously but not this

489
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,680
like that was just kids running in the street pretending that one you know

490
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:05,000
ghosts and stuff but I think I like that to you virtual but maybe yeah the the

491
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,660
virtual dots that project in front of you that's kind of cool that's the new

492
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:12,400
part of it the other I've seen the GPS based pac-man that's kind of well this

493
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:19,080
one yeah they were using more of a radio sensor and there were people actually

494
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:25,340
dressed up as pac-man and people dressed up as the ghosts being directed by

495
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:32,420
people functioning as the AI and this was done in New York because they actually had

496
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:38,860
it sectioned out around Central Park where it all mapped out to exactly the Pac-Man grid.

497
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:46,060
But I thought this was pretty cool and what they're doing is also an experiment on the

498
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:50,340
whole GPS system but also on integrated gaming.

499
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,180
Gaming.

500
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,360
Very cool.

501
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,600
All right, well thanks for that report.

502
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,760
Moving on, you might have heard about the Halo movie.

503
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,840
Microsoft's been shipping out the Halo movie

504
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,540
like mad this week.

505
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,280
They sent folks dressed up in Master Chief outfits

506
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,360
to deliver the scripts to the studios.

507
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,100
They went all out for this.

508
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:13,100
They wanted $10 million plus 15% of the box office revenue

509
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,640
and they wanted a heck of a lot of control

510
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,560
over the film as well.

511
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,160
They wanted all these seats for the premiere.

512
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,320
Now granted, some of this could be rumor,

513
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,520
but the internet's saying they wanted seats for the premiere,

514
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,120
and they wanted control over the actors that were going

515
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,400
to be in it and all this stuff.

516
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,440
Well, they got some of it.

517
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,920
Two studios actually teamed up, Universal Pictures

518
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,240
and 20th Century Fox.

519
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,860
They're going to offer $5 million and 10%

520
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,640
of the initial box office revenue.

521
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:41,480
So we'll be looking at more formal details announced

522
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,840
a little later on when all the t's are crossed

523
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,320
and i's are dotted, but you can look for a joint studio,

524
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:51,780
Halo the movie production. I'm sure it will be decent since it's got a pretty generic

525
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:55,980
storyline. We need a decent video game movie, but this could be a good trend because Silent

526
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:01,040
Hill is looking good, Halo has a lot of potential, Spy Hunter. Two words when it comes to the

527
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:06,420
Halo movie, Starship Troopers. Yeah, yeah, yeah, Starship Troopers wasn't bad, it would

528
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:12,920
be fun. Um, what was I going to say, um, Spy Hunter, that's being worked on Universal,

529
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:18,360
and granted the rocks getting it but you know the rocks now becoming a more legitimate actor

530
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:23,480
so it could be cool and I wouldn't think there's a lot to work with the spy hunter though so

531
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:28,200
you have a lot of room to you have a with a car low yeah with spy hunter there's not

532
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:32,040
a lot you got the car and your car changing with a halo you've got a very intricate story

533
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:36,520
between halo halo 2 and microsoft in fact wants to make sure their story does not get

534
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:40,380
screwed up by the movie they want that was very important to them because they are going

535
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:43,980
to do a Halo 3, that's a big duh. They want to make sure this movie isn't going to F that

536
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:47,940
out all the way. We don't want to run into Resident Evil Syndrome. You know what I'd

537
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:52,780
love to see though? What's that? Red vs. Blue, the movie. Yes! Oh my god, that would be awesome.

538
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:58,380
A chupa thingy! They should totally, and I would, because Red vs. Blue has kind of become

539
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:02,740
like the spokesperson for Halo, sort of. So what they should do is have like, you know

540
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,540
how they have like cartoon movies, you know how they have the little mini cartoon? Have

541
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:09,980
a red vs blue little intro movie or something, that'd be kinda cool.

542
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:13,460
I wonder if there's actually been any updates to Red vs Blue, because I haven't watched

543
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,460
it since the second season.

544
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:19,580
They have new seasons, but anyways, I'm surprised a lot of these things like Red vs Blue, Homestar,

545
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:23,860
Runner, Strangerhood, I love the Strangerhood Theater, all that stuff, I'm surprised they

546
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:27,020
just don't all team up and start their own dang network, honestly.

547
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,020
I would watch it.

548
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,020
I would.

549
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:34,500
Okay, honestly, Red vs Blue, Internet TV Radio, no no no, seriously, Red vs Blue, The Strangerhood,

550
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:39,180
these do a damn show on G4. G4 has some really weird stuff that doesn't really

551
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:42,940
fit with that gaming network like their whole like you know import car thing

552
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:46,700
yeah I mean that's something that should be on MTV put this stuff on there I mean

553
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:51,860
it's it's done for them just publish it the end I guess it just doesn't sell I

554
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:55,180
don't know anyway you got a really quick update for us on Liberty City oh yes

555
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:58,940
Liberty City stories Grand Theft Auto there's a story because basically

556
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:04,220
another magazine is leaked information and the magazine in question this time

557
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:09,500
was the official PlayStation Magazine UK edition and hey there's some more UK

558
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:15,560
news yes and if you and for our wonderful podcast listeners if you mosey

559
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:20,240
on down to orange launch radio.com you can see that in the little read more

560
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:25,400
section I have included six packages for your enjoyment those packages being

561
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,800
scans of the actual magazine so you can see the wonderful in-game shots start

562
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,960
Start moseying.

563
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,960
Start moseying.

564
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:36,520
Basically, it's going to be just like Grand Theft Auto 3, it's going to be in Liberty

565
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,520
City again.

566
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:43,840
You play as Tony Cipriani in a 1998 Liberty City, so some of the stuff is going to be

567
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,840
a little bit different.

568
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:49,200
They have the same targeting system, motorbikes, as in the later games.

569
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,000
The missions are going to be a little bit shorter, but there's going to be more than

570
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,680
there were in Grand Theft Auto 3, and basically one of the theories is you might be able to

571
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,560
your own mp3s off the memory stick on your own radio station just kind of like the PC

572
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:07,360
version but that's pretty much it different packages and different secret stuff but definitely

573
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:11,520
worth picking up and that's going to be coming out I think in September sounds pretty cool

574
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:16,560
I'm going into a very very different type of game Dig Dug is coming back and it's going

575
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:23,720
to be on the DS it's called Dig Dug Digging Strike get it DS Digging Strike gonna be coming

576
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,920
out in Japan on September 8th the very interesting thing about Dig Dug Digging Strike is that

577
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,820
that they are taking elements of the original Dig Dug

578
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,580
and mixing it with Dig Dug 2.

579
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,880
Did any of you guys ever play Dig Dug 2?

580
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,720
I'm sure you all played Dig Dug 1.

581
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,540
Briefly.

582
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,220
Did you ever play Dig Dug 2 with like the island

583
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:42,220
and you were kind of axing off parts of the island?

584
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,500
It was a very different style of gameplay.

585
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,700
But what they're doing now,

586
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,980
and this was actually announced in the latest issue again,

587
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:52,380
of Famitsu Magazine, has kind of the combination

588
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:55,640
where kind of you got Dig Dug 2 going on on the top screen,

589
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,200
But then you got Dig Dug 1 going on on the bottom screen,

590
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,400
and you move around to different parts of the island,

591
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,400
and you kind of do the little Dig Dug 1 parts.

592
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,440
Kind of interesting.

593
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,240
I think it's kind of neat, just the idea of combining

594
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,880
two games in a new way for the DS.

595
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,120
This is kind of a cool thing.

596
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:14,080
And it doesn't look like it's whoring on the touch thing.

597
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:17,520
It looks like it's using the dual screen aspect of it

598
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,280
more than just the touch, which I think is good.

599
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,920
It's kind of interesting.

600
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,040
The DS doesn't have to be all about touching.

601
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,540
I'm sure they will use the touchscreen in one way or another, but I think it's kind of neat.

602
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:35,100
Exactly. All right. Also moving on, Sega! Sega's launched a brand new community

603
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:40,180
site. It's called Sega Link, and what it does is allows users to create their own

604
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:45,260
blogs and photo albums, and you chat with other users and all that stuff. Sega Link

605
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:51,300
also has a huge library with online games and board games, simple games, Sega

606
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:56,840
Classic and Link Collection is what they call it. The Sega Classic section

607
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:03,240
features Windows ports of Genesis titles like Golden Axe, Fantasy Star, and it

608
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:09,440
would cost you about $1.12 to play for 24 hours. Not too shabby, but here's the

609
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:15,880
bad news. SEGALINK.JP. It's a Japanese only site right now. Credit card to work

610
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:21,880
in Japan I can get a Japanese address Sega link dot JP if you're thinking

611
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:27,820
about going around the back door to get on that site might be kind of fun what I

612
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:31,320
think is interesting about this article is talking about the Nintendo Revolution

613
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:36,440
and of course we don't know a lot about what the Nintendo Revolution is going to

614
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:40,880
offer but we do know now one thing that they will not offer they are saying and

615
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,440
and this is GameCube Advanced that is reporting this

616
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:48,500
the revolution will not support high-definition signals

617
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:53,640
from the article quote Nintendo doesn't plan for the system to be HD compatible

618
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,560
as with that comes a higher price for both the consumer

619
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,960
and also the developer creating the game very interesting if you want more

620
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,440
information on that GC

621
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:06,320
dot advanced MN dot com not sure that's a good idea

622
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,320
me it's interesting

623
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:13,760
Cuz I heard that a lot of the TVs, the analog signals are gonna be cut off pretty soon here

624
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,200
where they're gonna be mandating where they have to make more HD TVs

625
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,600
versus analog TVs. Let me read the second part of the quote though.

626
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:24,560
With the technology being built into the revolution, we believe the games will

627
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,240
look brilliant and play brilliantly.

628
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,360
This can all be done without HD.

629
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:35,040
Interesting. I think that their intentions are good as far as making it a more

630
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,160
affordable system.

631
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,520
because there are people who will just go out and buy the cheaper one

632
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,720
you know and that will definitely help sales for them

633
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,520
however with the way the market's behaving isn't that sort of the same nail

634
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,720
that the Dreamcast put it

635
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:52,160
in their coffin? Don't know, don't know. Microsoft it's very interesting, Microsoft and Sony are

636
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,240
really whoring the HD thing, Microsoft is saying you must

637
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,920
make your games HD compatible. Microsoft has not made

638
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,560
a profit on the Xbox yet. You know what

639
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,800
I'm smelling some tricks up

640
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:11,720
Nintendo's sleeve man, they just blew it right out wide open there. Take it as you will. We'll see

641
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,760
More to come I'm sure one last story tonight for you guys here

642
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:21,340
And it has to do with Final Fantasy 11 because I know Loki's a big Final Fantasy 11 horror

643
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:25,980
Also another one from Famitsu magazine who is feeding us with all these articles tonight

644
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,200
Final Fantasy 11 producer Hiromichi

645
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,040
Tanaka

646
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,560
Disclosed that they are his team is currently working on a new

647
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,240
MMO

648
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:42,040
Specifically for next-generation consoles. Will it be a sequel to Final Fantasy 11?

649
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:47,000
it's unknown at this time, but it will be specifically next-generation consoles and

650
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:53,160
Finally, I have a brief really quick more summing up a few things television coming to the DS

651
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,760
That looks cool two more that legit or is that a hack? No, it's legit

652
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,260
Oh cool.

653
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:05,260
Two more games also coming from Capcom to the PSP. Those would be Mega Man Legends and...

654
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:09,260
God, I can't remember the other one. But anyways, Mega Man Legends is coming. That's the one I was happy about.

655
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:12,260
And I think some role-playing game. Fire Emblem or something.

656
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:19,260
Yes, yes. The new, actually the new Fire Emblem on GameCube is supposed to be really tremendous.

657
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:24,260
Really good. And there's been just a jump up for it. Lots of people.

658
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,260
To be continued on a later podcast.

659
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:34,260
And anybody out there listening that's in the PlayStation Portable or DS, you know, home development community,

660
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:40,260
please, please, please port ZZT or MegaZooks. Thank you.

661
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,260
I agree. ZZT would be needed. Thank you.

662
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:47,260
All right. That's going to do it for another podcast. Final thoughts. Loki.

663
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:54,260
I hope I can beat WarioWare Twisted and I hope I can get my Grand Theft Auto San Andreas back because I need to play it.

664
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:58,660
And I hope the PC version is done, uh, being purchased onto my computer.

665
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:01,260
DarkSockRay, your final thought?

666
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:11,260
As always, reject false icons, and my brand new 2002 Lancer OZ Rally completely kicks your ass.

667
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:15,260
And my final thought is, beware eye hunger.

668
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:20,260
Goodnight everybody, thank you for tuning in, and we'll see you next time on the Orange Lounge Radio To-Go Edition.

669
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:25,620
That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.
