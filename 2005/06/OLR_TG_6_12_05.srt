4
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:26,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, everybody out there on the internet who has subscribed to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition.

5
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:28,094
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate that.

6
00:00:28,594 --> 00:00:29,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks a bunch for tuning in.

7
00:00:30,635 --> 00:00:31,036
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

8
00:00:57,987 --> 00:01:00,068
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a new car!

9
00:01:01,169 --> 00:01:02,909
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm moving out of my hellhole apartment.

10
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:04,930
[SPEAKER_03]: In a couple weeks.

11
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:06,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Before the end of the month.

12
00:01:06,211 --> 00:01:08,252
[SPEAKER_03]: My birthday's coming up, what are you getting me?

13
00:01:15,934 --> 00:01:16,955
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll see you next time.

14
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:42,048
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they must be ranked in the top ten over on the alley, I don't know.

15
00:01:42,788 --> 00:01:46,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, my name is Rob Roberts, of course, also known as Sky.

16
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:53,674
[SPEAKER_03]: We're here to talk about games, and we're going to start off tonight's edition as we always do, talking about the games that we've been playing this week.

17
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:54,555
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, how about you?

18
00:01:55,855 --> 00:01:59,637
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Phantasy Star Online, Blue Burst.

19
00:01:59,818 --> 00:02:00,938
[SPEAKER_00]: The beta's over, right?

20
00:02:01,138 --> 00:02:07,302
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, actually, the beta will be over as of tomorrow, so it goes pay-to-play, and I will be...

21
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,335
[SPEAKER_00]: Registrating my account and canceling my Xbox One.

22
00:02:11,395 --> 00:02:13,176
[SPEAKER_03]: I will probably be canceling the Xbox One, too.

23
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:16,458
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm considering starting it on the PC, but I'm kind of on the fence.

24
00:02:16,838 --> 00:02:21,480
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a lot of fun with the beta, but I just feel like, do I really want to commit to this MMO?

25
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,360
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of do.

26
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:23,141
[SPEAKER_03]: One of us!

27
00:02:23,361 --> 00:02:24,742
[SPEAKER_03]: One of us!

28
00:02:25,202 --> 00:02:32,865
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish more folks would be taking that Guild Wars model, where just gouge me for 50 bucks when I buy the game, then don't charge me to pay per month anymore.

29
00:02:32,965 --> 00:02:34,106
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess...

30
00:02:35,398 --> 00:02:40,081
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Guild Wars has been doing very successful for that reason, but I guess other companies don't want to follow suit.

31
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:40,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

32
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:44,243
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also been watching Dan play a lot of Fire Emblem.

33
00:02:44,663 --> 00:02:46,484
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of Fire Emblem.

34
00:02:46,544 --> 00:02:47,645
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one?

35
00:02:49,826 --> 00:02:58,091
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard for me to think of the second release in the States as the second one because it's technically the third one on the Game Boy Advance.

36
00:03:00,132 --> 00:03:03,976
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one was the one that Marth and Roy were from, even if you ever played Smash Bros.

37
00:03:04,056 --> 00:03:04,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, I know Marth and Roy.

38
00:03:04,956 --> 00:03:06,017
[SPEAKER_00]: But we never got that game.

39
00:03:06,638 --> 00:03:10,922
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Dan found a ROM of it, and I found him an English patch for it.

40
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:18,088
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's been quite happy playing through that and getting his Fire Emblem on, and I like seeing how the games all connect.

41
00:03:18,188 --> 00:03:19,830
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, I'm thinking about starting to play it.

42
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,292
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate turn-based strategy, but I would play this.

43
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:25,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Fire Emblem is a game I never really got into.

44
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:26,502
[SPEAKER_03]: I just need to give it a second look, I think.

45
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:28,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why.

46
00:03:28,243 --> 00:03:34,449
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the rarest games I own is the Macross strategy game on the TurboGrafx, the PC Engine Duo.

47
00:03:35,369 --> 00:03:36,370
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hate that game.

48
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:36,851
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate it.

49
00:03:36,931 --> 00:03:38,252
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have it because it's hard to get.

50
00:03:38,932 --> 00:03:39,393
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously.

51
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:40,834
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you have Night Trap, right?

52
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:41,635
[SPEAKER_00]: And that game sucks.

53
00:03:41,915 --> 00:03:43,776
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, but Night Trap you can find anywhere.

54
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:45,532
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I thought that was a rare one.

55
00:03:46,032 --> 00:03:47,493
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you find it.

56
00:03:47,974 --> 00:03:49,435
[SPEAKER_00]: They say it's rare and blah blah blah.

57
00:03:49,675 --> 00:03:50,876
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not much of a collector.

58
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:54,078
[SPEAKER_00]: It has what's-her-face from different strokes.

59
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,279
[SPEAKER_00]: She died.

60
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,120
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

61
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:56,981
[SPEAKER_00]: She killed herself, did she?

62
00:03:57,001 --> 00:03:57,581
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

63
00:03:57,601 --> 00:03:57,841
[SPEAKER_00]: No, she OD'd.

64
00:03:57,861 --> 00:03:59,042
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, it was years ago.

65
00:03:59,062 --> 00:04:00,504
[SPEAKER_02]: After being in Night Trap.

66
00:04:01,344 --> 00:04:02,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

67
00:04:02,405 --> 00:04:02,885
[SPEAKER_00]: Be nice.

68
00:04:03,146 --> 00:04:03,486
[SPEAKER_00]: Be nice.

69
00:04:03,526 --> 00:04:05,928
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, down the block, not across the street.

70
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:09,691
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were in Night Trap, I would do it.

71
00:04:10,311 --> 00:04:12,193
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were desperate enough to be in Night Trap.

72
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:13,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

73
00:04:14,611 --> 00:04:15,172
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, not really.

74
00:04:15,192 --> 00:04:17,633
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be like, okay, I have money.

75
00:04:17,653 --> 00:04:19,515
[SPEAKER_03]: It's better than porn.

76
00:04:19,835 --> 00:04:21,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Y'all are stupid for the stupid game.

77
00:04:21,557 --> 00:04:21,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Could be worse.

78
00:04:21,977 --> 00:04:22,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Could be boring.

79
00:04:22,798 --> 00:04:27,721
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else you've been playing?

80
00:04:27,862 --> 00:04:30,063
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the games on the Gorillas webpage.

81
00:04:31,024 --> 00:04:35,888
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been playing with the darts at the toilet.

82
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:38,750
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

83
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,071
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll come back to web games in a minute.

84
00:04:40,131 --> 00:04:42,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what have you been playing this week?

85
00:04:42,498 --> 00:04:47,920
[SPEAKER_02]: I played a little bit, very briefly, of Tetris Worlds for the Game Boy Advance.

86
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:55,223
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's Tetris in eight different forms, or seven different forms, all of which are just too damn similar.

87
00:04:55,623 --> 00:04:56,823
[SPEAKER_02]: So Tetris is Tetris.

88
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:58,784
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I played WarioWare Twisted.

89
00:04:58,864 --> 00:05:01,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I played WarioWare Twisted about five minutes ago.

90
00:05:01,165 --> 00:05:09,167
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's fun, and it has a bunch of weird, stupid minigames in it that are just fun and just strange.

91
00:05:09,207 --> 00:05:10,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you can grade cake.

92
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,911
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

93
00:05:33,891 --> 00:05:36,354
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think of this game compared to WarioWare Touched?

94
00:05:36,635 --> 00:05:37,716
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't played WarioWare Touched.

95
00:05:37,736 --> 00:05:38,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I thought you had.

96
00:05:38,417 --> 00:05:39,218
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to pick it up, though.

97
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,802
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought about picking it up, and I need to go do that.

98
00:05:41,882 --> 00:05:48,130
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, most people I've talked to that have played all the games say that Twisted is the best, Touched is the worst, with the

99
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:49,710
[SPEAKER_03]: WarioWare Twisted is a very short game.

100
00:06:16,897 --> 00:06:17,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time.

101
00:06:17,597 --> 00:06:21,019
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can keep playing the same stage over and over, and I can just get unlocks that way.

102
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,100
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

103
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:31,624
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, the thing is, though, is because Nellie was playing some of the older stages, so she was unlocking games that I didn't have before, so I go and play my game, all of a sudden there's these games, and I'm like, what the hell do I have to do here?

104
00:06:31,644 --> 00:06:33,225
[SPEAKER_02]: It was funny.

105
00:06:34,365 --> 00:06:34,966
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of fun, though.

106
00:06:35,226 --> 00:06:35,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else?

107
00:06:37,187 --> 00:06:38,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XI, a little bit.

108
00:06:38,788 --> 00:06:39,708
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to play that.

109
00:06:40,368 --> 00:06:45,491
[SPEAKER_02]: I still wish they'd fixed their server problem, whatever it is, because it, like...

110
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,171
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

111
00:07:13,888 --> 00:07:17,431
[SPEAKER_02]: and it couldn't load anything, so I just backed out of it.

112
00:07:17,851 --> 00:07:28,280
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know what the problem is, and I know that it stopped me from playing a few times, and it's always around the same time, usually around 11pm-ish around there is when it stops.

113
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:36,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is great, because right before that happened, Nelly was bitching at me about... Nelly, my fiancé, was bitching at me how I was playing... Not the rapper.

114
00:07:37,308 --> 00:07:37,968
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not the rapper.

115
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:39,710
[SPEAKER_02]: She was saying how...

116
00:07:41,198 --> 00:07:49,143
[SPEAKER_02]: I was playing this stupid game and stuff and how I should, you know, come pay attention to her or something and then the game, you know, started crashing on me.

117
00:07:49,183 --> 00:07:51,645
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, are you sure she just didn't pull the plug?

118
00:07:52,065 --> 00:07:56,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm positive because my cable modem, my cable modem is right on my desk.

119
00:07:56,047 --> 00:07:56,828
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a DOF attack.

120
00:07:56,948 --> 00:07:58,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Denial of fiance.

121
00:07:58,789 --> 00:07:59,309
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

122
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:03,312
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this, the game, she didn't, she was just being cranky.

123
00:08:03,632 --> 00:08:07,354
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, she's just like, typical, never mind.

124
00:08:07,574 --> 00:08:08,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, seriously, typical.

125
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:09,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a spirit.

126
00:08:09,536 --> 00:08:09,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

127
00:08:10,516 --> 00:08:14,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Typical woman, she's like, I didn't say it, I didn't say it.

128
00:08:14,557 --> 00:08:16,418
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this shit doesn't happen in my house.

129
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:19,058
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to go outside, but I don't want to stay inside.

130
00:08:19,619 --> 00:08:21,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's no in between.

131
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,440
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't not go outside, not stay inside.

132
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell her to go sit in the doorway.

133
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,340
[SPEAKER_00]: Patio.

134
00:08:27,321 --> 00:08:29,481
[SPEAKER_00]: This shit does not happen in my house.

135
00:08:29,881 --> 00:08:34,483
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, get your ass off the PS2, because I want to play fucking Silent Hill.

136
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:36,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's never that.

137
00:08:36,923 --> 00:08:38,484
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just like, that'd be stupid.

138
00:08:38,504 --> 00:08:39,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell her to take up smoking.

139
00:08:40,239 --> 00:08:42,457
[SPEAKER_02]: She's been doing cross stitch, so, you know...

140
00:08:43,382 --> 00:08:44,263
[SPEAKER_02]: More power to her.

141
00:08:45,003 --> 00:08:45,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

142
00:08:46,124 --> 00:08:46,745
[SPEAKER_03]: My Gaming Week.

143
00:08:46,785 --> 00:08:49,467
[SPEAKER_03]: I also checked out WarioWare Twisted for a little bit.

144
00:08:49,747 --> 00:08:51,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because I had to play the Kid Icarus stage.

145
00:08:51,748 --> 00:08:52,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay?

146
00:08:52,629 --> 00:08:54,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, damn, that's a game they need to bring back.

147
00:08:55,271 --> 00:08:55,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

148
00:08:55,971 --> 00:08:56,992
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been how many years?

149
00:08:57,232 --> 00:08:58,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Why have they not brought that game back?

150
00:08:58,593 --> 00:08:59,554
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so upset.

151
00:08:59,854 --> 00:09:04,578
[SPEAKER_03]: But they tease us in WarioWare Twisted with a level inspired by Kid Icarus.

152
00:09:04,598 --> 00:09:05,658
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the boss battle.

153
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,162
[SPEAKER_02]: The boss battle for the retro games is you're playing Super Mario Bros.

154
00:09:10,662 --> 00:09:11,363
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like...

155
00:09:12,003 --> 00:09:13,104
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

156
00:09:28,841 --> 00:09:33,642
[SPEAKER_03]: None of the unlocks were really that great, but I'm kind of impressed with some of the things I'm seeing in Twisted so far.

157
00:09:33,982 --> 00:09:35,763
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that they have a lot more of the minigames.

158
00:09:35,823 --> 00:09:38,043
[SPEAKER_03]: I played the Apple Shooter or whatever that thing was.

159
00:09:38,123 --> 00:09:38,844
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of fun.

160
00:09:38,864 --> 00:09:39,464
[SPEAKER_02]: That was kind of funny.

161
00:09:39,484 --> 00:09:39,844
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.

162
00:09:40,004 --> 00:09:45,405
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, like, they have the Sheep County one that's pretty hard, because they... Oh, man, it pissed me off yesterday.

163
00:09:45,465 --> 00:09:46,466
[SPEAKER_02]: I was, like, getting really far in it.

164
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:50,347
[SPEAKER_02]: All of a sudden, the sheep stop, and then they run really fast, and they run into the wall, and then you're fucked.

165
00:09:50,687 --> 00:09:55,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know... And then they have, like, another one that's ski jumping that's pretty fun, and then...

166
00:09:56,448 --> 00:09:58,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Space Boomerang, which is just strange.

167
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

168
00:09:59,470 --> 00:09:59,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Crazy.

169
00:10:01,891 --> 00:10:04,673
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to play this if you get to murder sheep.

170
00:10:06,253 --> 00:10:07,314
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like in Lemmings, right?

171
00:10:07,914 --> 00:10:09,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you don't get to murder sheep.

172
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,056
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not trying to murder sheep.

173
00:10:11,136 --> 00:10:14,358
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that they smash into the wall and then you get a sheep pile.

174
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,039
[SPEAKER_00]: That just reminds me of a commercial.

175
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:19,140
[SPEAKER_03]: But you get to great cakes, DarkSakura.

176
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:19,821
[SPEAKER_00]: And carrots.

177
00:10:20,241 --> 00:10:22,482
[SPEAKER_00]: This reminds me of a commercial that I saw today.

178
00:10:22,902 --> 00:10:41,265
[SPEAKER_00]: Dan went on the classic video game commercial website, and they had one for a football game, as in soccer, of this old man lecturing his dog on, you know, don't let the sheep make fun of you, go out and get them, and so the dog's herding him in here, crowd cheering like it's playing with a goal and everything, and he's herding the sheep.

179
00:10:42,507 --> 00:10:43,287
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

180
00:11:00,524 --> 00:11:02,265
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is coming from a woman!

181
00:11:30,501 --> 00:11:31,281
[SPEAKER_00]: Smile and nod.

182
00:11:33,082 --> 00:11:35,103
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn the fine art of filtering.

183
00:11:37,524 --> 00:11:45,988
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start to hear the pitch rise just a little bit, say, you know, why don't we just take a moment and sit down and talk about this?

184
00:11:47,528 --> 00:11:52,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we get away from the women are from Venus and men are Mars chat for a minute?

185
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:56,532
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I will totally admit that we're from the moon.

186
00:11:57,518 --> 00:11:59,820
[SPEAKER_02]: If by Venus you mean Crazy Town, then yeah.

187
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, stop, enough.

188
00:12:01,401 --> 00:12:05,645
[SPEAKER_00]: No, as a woman, I can vouch for this, we're nuts.

189
00:12:06,706 --> 00:12:08,287
[SPEAKER_00]: But so are men, because men are stupid.

190
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:08,787
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.

191
00:12:10,225 --> 00:12:11,346
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm willing to live with that.

192
00:12:40,628 --> 00:12:43,570
[SPEAKER_02]: I can say without a doubt that I've never played any PopCap games ever.

193
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,451
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe you should.

194
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:45,611
[SPEAKER_00]: I had Neopets.

195
00:12:46,412 --> 00:12:49,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, that's laughable, so I feel better, yeah.

196
00:12:50,254 --> 00:12:53,977
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was very, very good at that bullshit game they had on there.

197
00:12:54,867 --> 00:13:01,689
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why, but I've just been all about playing Zuma and all the games that are on there.

198
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:02,729
[SPEAKER_03]: And San Aquarium.

199
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:03,469
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that game.

200
00:13:03,669 --> 00:13:04,049
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.

201
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:04,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

202
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:06,630
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

203
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:17,452
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I'm letting everybody down by admitting that I play PopCap games because they're the same games that the 50-something-year-old women I work with play on their breaks.

204
00:13:17,592 --> 00:13:18,673
[SPEAKER_03]: They're playing Bookworm.

205
00:13:18,813 --> 00:13:22,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that like Apple saying, you know, we're going to put Intel processors in our PCs now?

206
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:24,374
[SPEAKER_02]: We're letting you down.

207
00:13:25,881 --> 00:13:26,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh well, alright.

208
00:13:27,322 --> 00:13:29,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, let's move on to some more gaming news.

209
00:13:29,924 --> 00:13:32,786
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to do a follow-up to a gaming story we were talking about a couple weeks ago.

210
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:36,169
[SPEAKER_03]: The gaming actors, you might remember, they were threatening to go on strike.

211
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:37,790
[SPEAKER_03]: This would have to do with the voice actors.

212
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:48,138
[SPEAKER_03]: They did vote, and actually a majority voted to strike, but they needed to have a super majority in order to strike, two-thirds, and they did not achieve that.

213
00:13:48,937 --> 00:13:51,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Just no ordinary majority will do.

214
00:13:51,438 --> 00:13:53,299
[SPEAKER_02]: We need super majority.

215
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:59,901
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically right now... Is that even a real concept or is that just saying, we don't really care what you think?

216
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:00,942
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

217
00:14:01,002 --> 00:14:02,342
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, this is the contract.

218
00:14:02,422 --> 00:14:03,943
[SPEAKER_03]: It's now going to be good through the end of 2008.

219
00:14:04,863 --> 00:14:10,866
[SPEAKER_03]: It will grant the voice actors an increase in pay up to 36% through the duration of the contract.

220
00:14:11,186 --> 00:14:12,947
[SPEAKER_03]: The first raise, which will be a 25% hike...

221
00:14:14,307 --> 00:14:15,949
[SPEAKER_03]: goes into effect July 1st.

222
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:21,953
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're curious how much they make right now, the minimum rate for a four-hour voice acting session, $556.

223
00:14:22,254 --> 00:14:23,715
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's going up by 25%.

224
00:14:23,995 --> 00:14:25,516
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be a voice actor now.

225
00:14:25,857 --> 00:14:29,480
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that the voice actors didn't get was the residuals.

226
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:36,906
[SPEAKER_03]: You might remember that this was a big thing they were pushing for was they want to get... If the game's successful, they want a chunk of the profits because the actors feel that they contribute to that.

227
00:14:37,306 --> 00:14:38,847
[SPEAKER_03]: So they wanted that.

228
00:14:38,887 --> 00:14:39,688
[SPEAKER_03]: They did not get that.

229
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:40,709
[SPEAKER_03]: They only got the pay raise.

230
00:14:40,809 --> 00:14:42,610
[SPEAKER_03]: So, well, at least it's something, huh?

231
00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:42,891
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

232
00:14:43,471 --> 00:14:44,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Voices of Famous People in Your Games

233
00:14:54,853 --> 00:15:23,739
[SPEAKER_03]: and so therefore when they say all in favor of you know striking's AI you are a dumbass alright moving on to a follow up from another story we did a couple weeks ago actually it was a couple months ago at this point can you believe we've been doing this crap that long GameStop and EB you might remember it was announced they're gonna merge into this powerhouse gaming store but remember as we said to sum it up GameStop and EB were not each other's competition the real competition Walmart, Target

234
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:25,620
[SPEAKER_03]: So now they're joining forces.

235
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,062
[SPEAKER_03]: The merger was okayed by the federal government.

236
00:15:30,023 --> 00:15:31,184
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a done deal.

237
00:15:31,404 --> 00:15:32,024
[SPEAKER_03]: It will happen.

238
00:15:32,044 --> 00:15:37,408
[SPEAKER_03]: So those of you guys that maybe work for one or the other that were a little bit nervous about teaming up with the enemy,

239
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:39,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, it's a done deal now.

240
00:15:39,604 --> 00:15:41,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, they're the same store already.

241
00:15:41,165 --> 00:15:47,809
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just like, you can literally put like a GameStop sign out from EB and it would look just like a GameStop.

242
00:15:47,869 --> 00:15:52,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, one thing that you may not realize is that, and this is something I learned today, is that they advertise match.

243
00:15:52,913 --> 00:15:56,155
[SPEAKER_03]: So if EB's running an ad, GameStop will match that ad.

244
00:15:56,195 --> 00:16:00,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, granted, this would be, you know, some stores may not go for this, but most stores are going to do this.

245
00:16:00,538 --> 00:16:04,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Any, you know, store that wants to stay in business will do the ad matching.

246
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,042
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can even take in an ad from EB Games to a GameStop and...

247
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:09,887
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when they used to use...

248
00:16:30,467 --> 00:16:32,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Engage Games going in the discount bin.

249
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,992
[SPEAKER_03]: The Engage is gone from Dan's store.

250
00:16:36,212 --> 00:16:39,374
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually overheard a guy in one of the stores.

251
00:16:39,394 --> 00:16:47,321
[SPEAKER_03]: I was at one of the other stores today, and I actually overheard a guy asking for help on the Engage tech support, and I just felt like walking by going, dude, just throw it away.

252
00:16:47,701 --> 00:16:48,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop wasting your time.

253
00:16:48,622 --> 00:16:50,263
[SPEAKER_00]: The taco of doom.

254
00:16:50,824 --> 00:16:59,891
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just sad walking through E3 and seeing what a big, beautiful setup they had, and all of five people there, including us as we were passing through it.

255
00:17:02,073 --> 00:17:06,708
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying not to make any sudden movements in case any of the Engage Arena staff might see me.

256
00:17:06,989 --> 00:17:07,170
[SPEAKER_02]: You go...

257
00:17:08,055 --> 00:17:08,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone's interested!

258
00:17:08,915 --> 00:17:09,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Get him!

259
00:17:10,015 --> 00:17:11,416
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought someone was heading to me.

260
00:17:11,936 --> 00:17:17,977
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like... Dude, it only took me... I swear to you, 30 seconds of playing Civilization on the N-Gage.

261
00:17:18,177 --> 00:17:25,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I just had... Civilization is one of my... Probably... No, I... And keep in mind, I was addicted to Final Fantasy XI for two and a half years.

262
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:28,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Civilization, I was addicted to for a longer period.

263
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,420
[SPEAKER_03]: And I absolutely love that game.

264
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,720
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my favorite PC game of all time.

265
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,161
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had to see what happened to it on the N-Gage.

266
00:17:36,608 --> 00:17:38,430
[SPEAKER_03]: 30 seconds or less, there was a guy over.

267
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any questions?

268
00:17:40,091 --> 00:17:40,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

269
00:17:40,432 --> 00:17:42,474
[SPEAKER_03]: How do I do anything on this game?

270
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:44,756
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot figure anything out.

271
00:17:45,196 --> 00:17:46,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Why does it suck so bad?

272
00:17:47,058 --> 00:17:47,398
[SPEAKER_03]: I laughed.

273
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:48,539
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's weird, though?

274
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,242
[SPEAKER_00]: This game is making my stomach lighting bleed.

275
00:17:51,802 --> 00:17:56,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Love Civilization 1, never got into Civ 2 or 3, even though most people consider Civ 2 as the peak of the series.

276
00:17:57,167 --> 00:17:58,148
[SPEAKER_03]: I never got into Civ 2 or 3.

277
00:17:58,448 --> 00:17:58,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't know why.

278
00:17:58,989 --> 00:17:59,990
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm still curious about Civ 4.

279
00:18:01,983 --> 00:18:03,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Another follow-up story.

280
00:18:03,203 --> 00:18:04,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots and lots of follow-up stories tonight.

281
00:18:04,604 --> 00:18:11,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo, you might remember that there was this rumor going around about the revolution, where they're going to be doing the downloadable games.

282
00:18:11,945 --> 00:18:12,985
[SPEAKER_03]: That hasn't changed.

283
00:18:13,005 --> 00:18:16,226
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still going to be offering the retro games for download in the library.

284
00:18:16,286 --> 00:18:17,226
[SPEAKER_03]: No real specifics.

285
00:18:17,626 --> 00:18:26,908
[SPEAKER_03]: But what did happen is that in an interview in Famitsu Magazine, Nintendo president Satoru Iwata says, you guys are making up rumors out there.

286
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,608
[SPEAKER_03]: We never said this was going to be free.

287
00:18:29,977 --> 00:18:31,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Some Might Be Free

288
00:18:52,489 --> 00:18:58,991
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, obviously it's not going to all be free because, you know, let's just not make any money from re-releasing our games 50 times like we do all the time.

289
00:18:59,531 --> 00:19:17,496
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I kind of found it hard to believe, too, that when you are releasing these classic Nintendo games such as, you know, Metroid, even though you can unlock Metroid through two other Metroid games, either Metroid Zero Mission or the Metroid Prime Fusion link-up, they were charging $20 for this separately.

290
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:20,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of found it hard to believe that suddenly this game would be free on the Revolution.

291
00:19:21,617 --> 00:19:21,777
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

292
00:19:23,444 --> 00:19:23,764
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

293
00:19:53,874 --> 00:19:57,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting story out of China going on.

294
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:07,489
[SPEAKER_03]: You might have heard about this online, but there was actually a fight that broke out between two individuals in China over a virtual sword.

295
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:11,053
[SPEAKER_03]: And this one Chinese guy...

296
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:14,618
[SPEAKER_03]: and I will horribly pronounce this, I apologize.

297
00:20:14,978 --> 00:20:25,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Kui Chengwei was the guy that attacked Zhu Kaoyan and murdered him, basically, over a dispute over an online sword.

298
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:28,344
[SPEAKER_03]: And the parents are upset.

299
00:20:29,204 --> 00:20:33,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Kui received a suspended death sentence for this attack.

300
00:20:34,006 --> 00:20:34,987
[SPEAKER_03]: The virtual sword

301
00:20:35,888 --> 00:20:39,170
[SPEAKER_03]: was sold to another gamer for 7,200 yuan, and that's $600 United States money.

302
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:40,790
[SPEAKER_03]: So a $600 sword got murdered over.

303
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like a cracking club.

304
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:58,977
[SPEAKER_02]: in Final Fantasy XI?

305
00:20:59,077 --> 00:21:01,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you murder someone over a Kraken Club, though?

306
00:21:01,698 --> 00:21:02,458
[SPEAKER_03]: That's insane.

307
00:21:02,858 --> 00:21:03,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

308
00:21:03,398 --> 00:21:04,638
[SPEAKER_03]: You gotta draw the line somewhere.

309
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:05,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

310
00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:10,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Kraken Club, that's just like, you know, knees broken, I mean, because that's not even worth that.

311
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:15,361
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, granted, this is a story out of China, but the sad thing is, I could see this happening here.

312
00:21:16,061 --> 00:21:17,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anyone want to doubt me?

313
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:19,862
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't doubt it at all because people are stupid.

314
00:21:20,702 --> 00:21:25,583
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people... Life... Allow me to get a little philosophical here.

315
00:21:25,603 --> 00:21:25,823
[SPEAKER_00]: Please.

316
00:21:25,843 --> 00:21:26,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Please.

317
00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:38,334
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we live in a world where things are not the bright, beautiful sunshine that, you know, MTV and Teletubbies wants us to think it is.

318
00:21:39,115 --> 00:21:40,996
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I love you!

319
00:21:42,256 --> 00:21:47,719
[SPEAKER_00]: But seriously, it's not all about pop star drama and reality TV.

320
00:21:48,219 --> 00:21:49,660
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an illusion.

321
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,842
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing is that people are looking, you know, people understand that

322
00:21:54,264 --> 00:22:00,808
[SPEAKER_00]: That we're really living in a pretty dark time right now with all the crap that's going on in the world.

323
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:08,412
[SPEAKER_00]: And even their own lives are so mundane and maybe so unhappy that people are always looking for a form of escape.

324
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:10,233
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we watch TV.

325
00:22:10,613 --> 00:22:11,813
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we listen to music.

326
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:12,994
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're here.

327
00:22:13,174 --> 00:22:15,695
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, we're here to offer that to our listeners.

328
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,417
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the point where you start...

329
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:26,308
[SPEAKER_00]: Wanting to escape it to the point where you are totally immersing yourself in fantasy.

330
00:22:26,828 --> 00:22:28,510
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the point that it's gone on too far.

331
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:34,357
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start losing touch like that, that's when you start losing it in your head.

332
00:22:35,109 --> 00:22:54,983
[SPEAKER_00]: at least there is poetic justice in this world because Britney Spears Chaotic is one of the lowest rated shows on television so at least there is poetic justice in the world I didn't mean to be down on it but that's my whole theory on this whole epidemic of people immersing themselves in all these MMOs is the fact that basically life sucks

333
00:22:55,663 --> 00:22:56,564
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have some fun.

334
00:22:56,604 --> 00:22:58,365
[SPEAKER_03]: So you see MMOs as an escape?

335
00:22:58,485 --> 00:23:01,327
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it as any form of entertainment.

336
00:23:01,387 --> 00:23:01,887
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll admit it.

337
00:23:01,907 --> 00:23:04,989
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, Final Fantasy XI, when I was so into it, was a bit of an escape.

338
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,210
[SPEAKER_03]: But games in general are kind of an escape.

339
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,511
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't let it blur the line with the real world.

340
00:23:09,611 --> 00:23:11,032
[SPEAKER_03]: I realize it's fictional.

341
00:23:11,252 --> 00:23:13,214
[SPEAKER_03]: But unfortunately, not everybody has that brain capacity.

342
00:23:13,234 --> 00:23:14,354
[SPEAKER_02]: But Vanadil doesn't exist.

343
00:23:14,675 --> 00:23:14,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Shush.

344
00:23:15,675 --> 00:23:19,259
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, though, that it's these people that get too far into it.

345
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:27,528
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even, you know, get too far... I have to admit, I'm a pretty rabid, you know, Gorillaz fan, but not to the point where I can't distinguish between reality and not.

346
00:23:27,548 --> 00:23:30,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Where you think you're going to marry Murdoch, considering he's a cartoon character.

347
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:31,092
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

348
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:31,973
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

349
00:23:32,634 --> 00:23:33,074
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

350
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:33,955
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

351
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:35,337
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm saying...

352
00:23:36,805 --> 00:23:38,166
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a limit to that.

353
00:23:40,728 --> 00:23:46,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember in the 80s, the screaming Michael Jackson fans and the woman who thought that she was his wife and had his baby.

354
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:50,175
[SPEAKER_00]: And to this day, she still claims to be his wife.

355
00:23:51,156 --> 00:23:52,477
[SPEAKER_00]: That is losing yourself.

356
00:23:53,017 --> 00:23:55,118
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to the point of going nutso.

357
00:23:55,699 --> 00:23:56,920
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like the guy in China.

358
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,783
[SPEAKER_00]: They were too far into their game to be able to distinguish it from reality.

359
00:24:00,843 --> 00:24:03,264
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you go that far, that's it.

360
00:24:05,266 --> 00:24:05,546
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

361
00:24:05,964 --> 00:24:12,649
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have any feedback, comments, want to give a shout out to Jamie, or you want to maybe give her a question or whatever.

362
00:24:12,729 --> 00:24:14,631
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to seeing a counterpoint.

363
00:24:15,231 --> 00:24:17,513
[SPEAKER_03]: 2go at orangeloungeradio.com.

364
00:24:17,753 --> 00:24:18,694
[SPEAKER_03]: 2go at orangeloungeradio.com.

365
00:24:18,714 --> 00:24:23,658
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually added a new section of our website even over at orangeloungeradio.com that says contact staff.

366
00:24:23,738 --> 00:24:27,101
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to contact any of us, our emails are all right there, as well as the general address.

367
00:24:27,121 --> 00:24:29,503
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to give a shout to the people I heard from last week.

368
00:24:30,263 --> 00:24:32,125
[SPEAKER_00]: To Jimmy, who...

369
00:24:33,106 --> 00:24:35,809
[SPEAKER_00]: Likes our podcast and Misty's back.

370
00:24:36,189 --> 00:24:36,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.

371
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:39,452
[SPEAKER_00]: And to Robin from PodNova.

372
00:24:40,173 --> 00:24:40,614
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, cool.

373
00:24:40,654 --> 00:24:40,934
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.

374
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:43,116
[SPEAKER_00]: So, hi to all you guys.

375
00:24:43,136 --> 00:24:43,616
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for writing.

376
00:24:44,037 --> 00:24:46,700
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd like to give a shout out to the people that have contacted me.

377
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:53,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to VidRx for the wonderful blue pill ads.

378
00:24:53,086 --> 00:24:53,807
[SPEAKER_02]: I love those.

379
00:24:54,107 --> 00:24:55,048
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you to...

380
00:24:58,166 --> 00:25:01,347
[SPEAKER_02]: HotSluts.com for sending me ads.

381
00:25:01,707 --> 00:25:07,029
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, I have enough free PSP offers, so no thanks for those.

382
00:25:07,709 --> 00:25:12,431
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, the game in question, because I'm sure you guys are curious, what game was this?

383
00:25:12,691 --> 00:25:15,472
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the actual game called Legend of Myr 3.

384
00:25:16,092 --> 00:25:19,493
[SPEAKER_03]: So not something I've heard of here, but it must be more popular overseas.

385
00:25:19,553 --> 00:25:20,974
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have heard of that one, actually.

386
00:25:21,614 --> 00:25:21,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Not me.

387
00:25:22,155 --> 00:25:22,695
[SPEAKER_03]: What can I say?

388
00:25:23,115 --> 00:25:23,335
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

389
00:25:23,395 --> 00:25:39,207
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a good follow-up piece would be DarkSakura is on a roll here, so I think she needs to start dishing out her advice column here because, you know, we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we're not just here to talk about games all the time because if we talked about games all the time, we'd have no time to go sit in the doorway.

390
00:25:39,767 --> 00:25:45,091
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are here to better your life with the advice column because you need to go outside once in a while.

391
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:47,953
[SPEAKER_03]: And who better than our one and only DarkSakura?

392
00:25:47,993 --> 00:25:50,855
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what are you going to give the kids some advice about tonight?

393
00:25:51,636 --> 00:25:54,777
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's piece of advice is how to survive when lost in the jungle.

394
00:25:54,797 --> 00:25:56,457
[SPEAKER_03]: This is helpful.

395
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:56,858
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

396
00:25:57,558 --> 00:25:58,618
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, find water.

397
00:25:59,218 --> 00:26:07,121
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do not have the means to purify water, cut sections from large water vines or cut banana trees to capture the water welling out from the stalks.

398
00:26:07,621 --> 00:26:12,122
[SPEAKER_00]: Only drink water from streams and rivers as a last resort as this water will most likely give you diarrhea.

399
00:26:14,003 --> 00:26:16,744
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, eat only foods that you can peel or cook.

400
00:26:17,224 --> 00:26:20,305
[SPEAKER_00]: Avoid brightly colored plants or plants with a milky sap.

401
00:26:20,325 --> 00:26:21,325
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of these are poisonous.

402
00:26:22,037 --> 00:26:26,802
[SPEAKER_00]: Insects, grubs, and raw fish, except those with bristles or spines rather than scales, are safe to eat.

403
00:26:27,222 --> 00:26:28,363
[SPEAKER_00]: Peel fruits before eating.

404
00:26:28,564 --> 00:26:30,726
[SPEAKER_00]: Peels may harbor diarrhea-causing bacteria.

405
00:26:31,647 --> 00:26:33,669
[SPEAKER_00]: But, my final piece of advice?

406
00:26:33,829 --> 00:26:34,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

407
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:35,711
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay out of Brazil.

408
00:26:37,533 --> 00:26:39,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless... We might have listeners there.

409
00:26:39,114 --> 00:26:39,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Be nice.

410
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:41,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless, of course, you can't go... I mean, in the jungle.

411
00:26:42,942 --> 00:26:43,743
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go to the jungle.

412
00:26:43,863 --> 00:26:45,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go to the jungle unless you can't, you know, go.

413
00:26:46,046 --> 00:26:47,307
[SPEAKER_00]: And watch out for dinosaurs.

414
00:26:48,328 --> 00:26:51,111
[SPEAKER_00]: And bring toilet paper because you might breathe and catch diarrhea.

415
00:26:52,813 --> 00:26:56,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Be sure not to slip on the diarrhea in the jungle.

416
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:02,598
[SPEAKER_03]: That's more usages of the word diarrhea than we have allotted for this show.

417
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:04,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, did you have some stories you wanted to share with us tonight?

418
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:08,181
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you're excited about this PSP hacking thing.

419
00:27:10,082 --> 00:27:18,906
[SPEAKER_02]: As it's been rumored all week, PSP, everyone's looking for a way to run homebrew applications on version 1.5 PSP.

420
00:27:18,926 --> 00:27:20,247
[SPEAKER_02]: For those not in the know,

421
00:27:23,228 --> 00:27:28,753
[SPEAKER_02]: The version 1.0 PSPs were the very first ones launched in Japan and all the US ones were version 1.5.

422
00:27:29,093 --> 00:27:37,019
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of us over here, unless you actually import a 1.0 version PSP, you can't run those cool emulators and all that stuff.

423
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:46,507
[SPEAKER_02]: However, now there's this one website stating, yes, they found a way and they're going to launch it on...

424
00:27:47,614 --> 00:27:50,196
[SPEAKER_02]: June 15th on the 15th hour.

425
00:27:50,816 --> 00:27:53,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I get it.

426
00:27:53,618 --> 00:27:53,598
1.5.

427
00:27:55,439 --> 00:28:05,725
[SPEAKER_02]: The website, only4.info, they have a video on there that's showing a version 1.5 PSP running.

428
00:28:05,765 --> 00:28:08,267
[SPEAKER_03]: The number 4, only 4, or only F-O-R?

429
00:28:08,407 --> 00:28:11,109
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only and then the number 4.

430
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:12,570
[SPEAKER_02]: All one word, .info.

431
00:28:14,951 --> 00:28:21,137
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have a video, people are of course saying, oh it's fakes, and people are saying, oh it's real.

432
00:28:22,098 --> 00:28:25,561
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess you'll find out on Wednesday when this is actually launched.

433
00:28:26,202 --> 00:28:30,726
[SPEAKER_02]: And supposedly they have a tutorial on how to make programs to run in version 1.5.

434
00:28:32,225 --> 00:28:37,446
[SPEAKER_02]: And it only works in version 1.5 because whatever the hole is was fixed in version 1.51.

435
00:28:38,046 --> 00:28:44,248
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully you haven't upgraded your PSP to anything above 1.5 because otherwise you're screwed.

436
00:28:45,088 --> 00:28:54,630
[SPEAKER_02]: But this makes a lot of sense since also they have some brand new stuff for the PSP homebrew stuff.

437
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:55,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Like for example...

438
00:28:56,517 --> 00:29:03,522
[SPEAKER_02]: X-MAME was released for the PSP, and that's MAME for your PSP, so you can play all your favorite arcade emulators.

439
00:29:04,143 --> 00:29:11,408
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also there's emulators now out for the Game Boy Color, for the Mega Drive.

440
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:13,950
[SPEAKER_02]: for Neo Geo Pocket.

441
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Just tons of stuff out there.

442
00:29:17,432 --> 00:29:23,997
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully this will happen and we'll see this being able to play these homebrew applications.

443
00:29:24,017 --> 00:29:30,982
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you go to this website on the 15th, either you're going to find the holy grail here of emulation on the PSP, or you're going to find your computer filled with spyware.

444
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:32,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Because this would be a practical joke.

445
00:29:32,523 --> 00:29:33,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

446
00:29:33,724 --> 00:29:34,945
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it sounds pretty legit.

447
00:29:34,985 --> 00:29:38,407
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be, it'll be everywhere on the net if this is the case because it's going to just

448
00:29:39,308 --> 00:29:40,208
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big thing.

449
00:29:41,249 --> 00:29:43,191
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you will bring us a full report.

450
00:29:43,391 --> 00:29:43,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.

451
00:29:44,412 --> 00:29:49,456
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, on the other portable end, we have DS.

452
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:53,319
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Space Invaders for the DS, and they're actually playing that.

453
00:29:54,520 --> 00:30:00,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I believe they're running on Linux, because they have Linux running for the DS right now.

454
00:30:01,186 --> 00:30:02,607
[SPEAKER_00]: When's it going to be installed on a toaster?

455
00:30:03,214 --> 00:30:05,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you hear this story from earlier this week?

456
00:30:05,415 --> 00:30:07,056
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't have the article up in front of me.

457
00:30:07,076 --> 00:30:09,037
[SPEAKER_03]: For some reason, I forgot to pull it up for tonight's stuff.

458
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:13,520
[SPEAKER_03]: But PlayStation 3, they're saying, will have Linux installed on it by default.

459
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:18,303
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 3, their hard drives will come with Linux installed on them because they're not being included.

460
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:26,828
[SPEAKER_02]: But they said that you would be able to install other operating systems such as Windows and Tiger, which would be the Mac OS X.

461
00:30:27,595 --> 00:30:27,895
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.

462
00:30:43,971 --> 00:30:45,932
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

463
00:30:59,918 --> 00:31:08,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here, we've got also details that the Nintendo DS outsells the Sony PSP and PlayStation 2 combined in Japan.

464
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:14,121
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually sold that well, and you can probably thank that to Nintendogs, because Nintendogs rocks.

465
00:31:14,261 --> 00:31:16,022
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's going to be a big thing here too.

466
00:31:16,202 --> 00:31:24,264
[SPEAKER_00]: Nintendogs actually has a little epidemic attached to it, sort of catching on the way Pokemon, you know, the little shaky ones...

467
00:31:25,044 --> 00:31:30,670
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, they're, you know, it's like I was talking to the guy at E3.

468
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:34,574
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be, the boys start playing Nintendogs to pick up girls.

469
00:31:35,455 --> 00:31:39,319
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the girls were all playing it and their little puppies would bark at them.

470
00:31:39,819 --> 00:31:41,461
[SPEAKER_00]: So the boys' doggies would bark back.

471
00:31:41,701 --> 00:31:42,982
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what's going on in the UK?

472
00:32:12,101 --> 00:32:15,403
[SPEAKER_00]: National University of Singapore by a mixed reality lab.

473
00:32:16,244 --> 00:32:26,189
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they were doing, they're having it, they're using GPS, Bluetooth, virtual reality, Wi-Fi, infrared, and sensing mechanisms trying to create a virtual world.

474
00:32:26,209 --> 00:32:32,633
[SPEAKER_00]: So these people are wearing these hats, these goggles, and it's actually putting the dots in front of them and they're running the maze.

475
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:38,176
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's pretty cool, you know, there's pictures in the

476
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:41,742
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

477
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:01,582
[SPEAKER_03]: That was just kids running in the street pretending to be ghosts and stuff.

478
00:33:01,782 --> 00:33:03,403
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I think that to you.

479
00:33:04,063 --> 00:33:04,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, yeah.

480
00:33:04,924 --> 00:33:08,165
[SPEAKER_03]: The virtual dots that project in front of you, that's kind of cool.

481
00:33:08,185 --> 00:33:09,606
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the new part of it.

482
00:33:09,666 --> 00:33:11,727
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen the GPS-based Pac-Man.

483
00:33:11,747 --> 00:33:12,167
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of cool.

484
00:33:12,187 --> 00:33:22,792
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this one, yeah, they were using more of a radio sensor, and there were people actually dressed up as Pac-Man, and people dressed up as the ghosts.

485
00:33:23,894 --> 00:33:29,716
[SPEAKER_00]: being directed by people basically functioning as the AI.

486
00:33:30,056 --> 00:33:37,818
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was done in New York because they actually had it sectioned out around Central Park where it all mapped out to exactly the Pac-Man grid.

487
00:33:38,678 --> 00:33:40,779
[SPEAKER_00]: But I thought this was pretty cool.

488
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:49,441
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they're doing is also an experiment on the whole GPS system, but also on integrated gaming.

489
00:33:52,523 --> 00:33:52,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

490
00:33:52,783 --> 00:33:54,225
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, thanks for that report.

491
00:33:55,686 --> 00:33:57,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on, you might have heard about the Halo movie.

492
00:33:57,848 --> 00:34:00,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Microsoft's been shipping out the Halo movie like mad this week.

493
00:34:01,571 --> 00:34:06,295
[SPEAKER_03]: They sent folks dressed up in Master Chief outfits to deliver the scripts to the studios.

494
00:34:06,395 --> 00:34:08,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's ridiculous.

495
00:34:08,137 --> 00:34:16,524
[SPEAKER_03]: They wanted $10 million plus 15% of the box office revenue, and they wanted a heck of a lot of control over the film as well.

496
00:34:16,544 --> 00:34:17,965
[SPEAKER_03]: They wanted all these seats for the premiere.

497
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:20,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, granted, some of this could be rumor, but...

498
00:34:20,387 --> 00:34:27,030
[SPEAKER_03]: But the internet's saying they wanted seats for the premiere and they wanted control over the actors that were going to be in it and all this stuff.

499
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:28,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they got some of it.

500
00:34:29,491 --> 00:34:33,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Two studios actually teamed up, Universal Pictures and 20th Century Fox.

501
00:34:33,233 --> 00:34:37,355
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to offer $5 million and 10% of the initial box office revenue.

502
00:34:37,715 --> 00:34:44,479
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll be looking at more formal details announced a little later on when all the T's are crossed and I's are dotted.

503
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:48,961
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can look for a joint studio, Halo the Movie Productions.

504
00:34:49,141 --> 00:34:52,462
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it'll be decent since it's got a pre-generic storyline.

505
00:34:52,562 --> 00:35:01,626
[SPEAKER_03]: We need a decent video game movie, but this could be a good trend because Silent Hill's looking good, Halo has a lot of potential, Spy Hunter... Two words when it comes to a Halo movie.

506
00:35:02,106 --> 00:35:02,726
[SPEAKER_00]: Starship Troopers.

507
00:35:04,027 --> 00:35:06,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Starship Troopers wasn't bad.

508
00:35:06,288 --> 00:35:09,149
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be fun to... What was I going to say?

509
00:35:09,769 --> 00:35:10,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Spy Hunter.

510
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:12,510
[SPEAKER_02]: That's being worked on Universal.

511
00:35:13,951 --> 00:35:18,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, The Rock's getting it, but The Rock's now becoming a more legitimate actor, so...

512
00:35:19,668 --> 00:35:20,308
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be cool.

513
00:35:21,269 --> 00:35:23,369
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't think there's a lot to work with with Spy Hunter, though.

514
00:35:23,429 --> 00:35:28,391
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have a lot of room to... With Spy Hunter, there's not a lot.

515
00:35:28,411 --> 00:35:29,071
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got the car.

516
00:35:30,332 --> 00:35:38,375
[SPEAKER_03]: With Halo, you've got a very intricate story between Halo, Halo 2, and Microsoft, in fact, wants to make sure that their story does not get screwed up by the movie.

517
00:35:38,455 --> 00:35:40,916
[SPEAKER_03]: That was very important to them because they are going to do a Halo 3.

518
00:35:40,976 --> 00:35:41,996
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a big duh.

519
00:35:42,296 --> 00:35:45,277
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to make sure this movie isn't going to F that up.

520
00:35:45,317 --> 00:35:47,178
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to run into Resident Evil syndrome.

521
00:35:47,438 --> 00:35:48,780
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'd love to see, though?

522
00:35:48,901 --> 00:35:49,181
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

523
00:35:49,241 --> 00:35:50,663
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Red vs. Blue, the movie.

524
00:35:50,884 --> 00:35:51,224
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes!

525
00:35:51,345 --> 00:35:52,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, that would be awesome.

526
00:35:52,727 --> 00:35:53,709
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a chupa thingy!

527
00:35:53,789 --> 00:36:00,480
[SPEAKER_02]: They should totally, and I would, because Red vs. Blue has kind of become the spokesperson for Halo, sort of.

528
00:36:00,905 --> 00:36:05,206
[SPEAKER_02]: So what they should do is have, you know how they have cartoon movies, you know how they have the little mini-cartoon?

529
00:36:05,446 --> 00:36:09,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a Red vs. Blue little intro movie or something, that'd be kind of cool.

530
00:36:10,487 --> 00:36:14,469
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if there's actually been any updates to Red vs. Blue, because I haven't watched it since the second season.

531
00:36:14,489 --> 00:36:16,789
[SPEAKER_02]: They have new seasons, but yeah, anyways.

532
00:36:16,929 --> 00:36:23,431
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised a lot of these things like Red vs. Blue, Homestar Runner, Strangerhood, I love the Strangerhood.

533
00:36:23,451 --> 00:36:26,812
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised they just don't all team up and start their own dang network, honestly.

534
00:36:27,092 --> 00:36:27,552
[SPEAKER_03]: I would watch it.

535
00:36:28,212 --> 00:36:29,893
[SPEAKER_02]: I would... Okay, honestly.

536
00:36:30,293 --> 00:36:30,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Red vs. Blue.

537
00:36:30,713 --> 00:36:31,713
[SPEAKER_00]: Internet TV Radio.

538
00:36:31,733 --> 00:36:32,273
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

539
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:32,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

540
00:36:32,854 --> 00:36:34,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Red vs. Blue, The Stranger Hood, all these.

541
00:36:35,394 --> 00:36:36,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Do a damn show on G4.

542
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:40,756
[SPEAKER_02]: G4 has some really weird stuff that doesn't really fit with that gaming network.

543
00:36:40,976 --> 00:36:43,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Like their whole import car thing.

544
00:36:43,497 --> 00:36:43,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

545
00:36:43,897 --> 00:36:45,298
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's something that should be on MTV.

546
00:36:45,638 --> 00:36:46,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Put this stuff on there.

547
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,018
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's done for them.

548
00:36:48,059 --> 00:36:48,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Just publish it.

549
00:36:49,099 --> 00:36:49,399
[SPEAKER_02]: The end.

550
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:51,752
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it just doesn't sell.

551
00:36:51,872 --> 00:36:52,152
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

552
00:36:52,212 --> 00:36:54,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, you got a really quick update for us on Liberty City?

553
00:36:54,955 --> 00:36:56,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes, Liberty City stories.

554
00:36:56,336 --> 00:36:57,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Grand Theft Auto, there's a story.

555
00:36:58,197 --> 00:37:01,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Because basically, another magazine has leaked information.

556
00:37:02,161 --> 00:37:07,545
[SPEAKER_02]: And the magazine in question this time was the official PlayStation Magazine UK edition.

557
00:37:08,446 --> 00:37:09,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, there's some more UK news.

558
00:37:10,308 --> 00:37:11,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and if you...

559
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:24,170
[SPEAKER_02]: And for our wonderful podcast listeners, if you mosey on down to OrangeLaunchRadio.com, you can see that in our little read more section, I have included six packages for your enjoyment.

560
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:29,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Those packages being scans of the actual magazine so you can see the wonderful in-game shots.

561
00:37:29,593 --> 00:37:30,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Start moseying.

562
00:37:30,793 --> 00:37:31,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Start moseying.

563
00:37:32,114 --> 00:37:34,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, it's going to be just like Grand Theft Auto 3.

564
00:37:34,735 --> 00:37:36,976
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be in Liberty City.

565
00:37:37,056 --> 00:37:39,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, you play as Tony Kipriani.

566
00:37:40,751 --> 00:37:42,612
[SPEAKER_02]: and a 1998 Liberty City.

567
00:37:42,672 --> 00:37:44,673
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of the stuff is going to be a little bit different.

568
00:37:44,693 --> 00:37:48,514
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the same targeting system, motorbikes, as in the later games.

569
00:37:49,235 --> 00:37:53,496
[SPEAKER_02]: The missions are going to be a little bit shorter, but there's going to be more than there were in Grand Theft Auto 3.

570
00:37:54,937 --> 00:38:03,020
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, one of the theories is you might be able to play your own MP3s off the memory stick on your own radio station, just kind of like the PC version.

571
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,541
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's pretty much it.

572
00:38:04,601 --> 00:38:09,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Different packages and different secret stuff, but definitely worth picking up, and that's going to be coming out, I think, in September.

573
00:38:10,285 --> 00:38:11,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds pretty cool.

574
00:38:11,906 --> 00:38:14,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Going into a very, very different type of game.

575
00:38:14,307 --> 00:38:17,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Dig Dug is coming back and it's going to be on the DS.

576
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:20,289
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Dig Dug Digging Strike.

577
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:21,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Get it?

578
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,150
[SPEAKER_03]: DS, Digging Strike.

579
00:38:23,331 --> 00:38:25,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Going to be coming out in Japan on September 8th.

580
00:38:25,772 --> 00:38:30,594
[SPEAKER_03]: The very interesting thing about Dig Dug Digging Strike is that they are taking elements of the original Dig Dug

581
00:38:30,974 --> 00:38:32,175
[SPEAKER_03]: and mixing it with Dig Dug 2.

582
00:38:32,535 --> 00:38:33,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Did any of you guys ever play Dig Dug 2?

583
00:38:33,836 --> 00:38:34,536
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure y'all played Dig Dug 1.

584
00:38:34,576 --> 00:38:34,816
[SPEAKER_00]: Briefly.

585
00:38:34,836 --> 00:38:35,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Barely.

586
00:38:35,256 --> 00:38:42,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you ever play Dig Dug 2 with like the island and you were kind of axing off parts of the island?

587
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,081
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a very different style of gameplay.

588
00:38:44,461 --> 00:38:50,865
[SPEAKER_03]: But what they're doing now, and this was actually announced in the latest issue again of Famitsu Magazine, has kind of the...

589
00:38:51,825 --> 00:38:54,807
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's kind of neat, just the idea of combining two games in a new way for the DS.

590
00:38:54,827 --> 00:38:55,767
[SPEAKER_03]: This is kind of a cool thing.

591
00:38:55,787 --> 00:38:57,848
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't look like it's whoring on the touch thing.

592
00:38:58,249 --> 00:39:01,390
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like it's using the dual screen aspect of it more than just the touch, which I think is good.

593
00:39:20,282 --> 00:39:21,822
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of interesting, you know.

594
00:39:21,902 --> 00:39:23,943
[SPEAKER_03]: The DS doesn't have to be all about touching.

595
00:39:23,983 --> 00:39:27,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure they will use the touchscreen in one way or another, but I think it's kind of neat.

596
00:39:28,064 --> 00:39:28,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

597
00:39:28,744 --> 00:39:30,105
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

598
00:39:30,605 --> 00:39:32,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, moving on, Sega.

599
00:39:33,165 --> 00:39:35,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Sega's launched a brand new community site.

600
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:44,028
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Sega Link, and what it does is allows users to create their own blogs and photo albums, and you chat with other users and all that stuff.

601
00:39:44,729 --> 00:39:49,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Sega Link also has a huge library with online games and board games.

602
00:39:50,397 --> 00:39:53,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Simple Games, Sega Classic, and Link Collection is what they call it.

603
00:39:55,639 --> 00:40:07,343
[SPEAKER_03]: The Sega Classic section features Windows ports of Genesis titles like Golden Axe, Phantasy Star, and it would cost you about $1.12 to play for 24 hours.

604
00:40:07,903 --> 00:40:09,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Not too shabby, but here's the bad news.

605
00:40:10,124 --> 00:40:11,824
[SPEAKER_03]: SegaLink.jp.

606
00:40:11,964 --> 00:40:13,685
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Japanese-only site right now.

607
00:40:15,322 --> 00:40:16,303
[SPEAKER_00]: Credit card dork in Japan.

608
00:40:18,665 --> 00:40:19,786
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get a Japanese address.

609
00:40:19,946 --> 00:40:24,910
[SPEAKER_03]: segalink.jp if you're thinking about going around the back door to get on that site.

610
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:25,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Might be kind of fun.

611
00:40:27,693 --> 00:40:33,978
[SPEAKER_03]: What I think is interesting about this article is it's talking about the Nintendo Revolution, and of course we don't know a lot about...

612
00:40:34,938 --> 00:40:39,361
[SPEAKER_03]: What the Nintendo Revolution is going to offer, but we do know now one thing that they will not offer.

613
00:40:39,822 --> 00:40:48,288
[SPEAKER_03]: They are saying, and this is GameCube Advanced that is reporting this, the Revolution will not support high definition signals.

614
00:40:49,649 --> 00:40:59,257
[SPEAKER_03]: From the article, quote, Nintendo doesn't plan for the system to be HD compatible as with that comes a higher price for both the consumer and also the developer creating the game.

615
00:40:59,932 --> 00:41:00,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting.

616
00:41:00,572 --> 00:41:06,194
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want more information on that, gc.advancedmn.com I'm not sure that's a good idea.

617
00:41:08,595 --> 00:41:09,176
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting.

618
00:41:09,396 --> 00:41:18,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I heard that a lot of the TVs, the analog signals are going to be cut off pretty soon here where they're going to be mandating where they have to make more HD TVs versus analog TVs.

619
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:20,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me read the second part of the quote though.

620
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:26,142
[SPEAKER_03]: With the technology being built into the revolution, we believe the games will look brilliant and play brilliantly.

621
00:41:26,362 --> 00:41:27,943
[SPEAKER_03]: This can all be done without HD.

622
00:41:30,015 --> 00:41:30,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-huh.

623
00:41:30,816 --> 00:41:31,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

624
00:41:31,457 --> 00:41:31,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-huh.

625
00:41:32,118 --> 00:41:36,022
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that their intentions are good as far as making it a more affordable system.

626
00:41:36,382 --> 00:41:39,065
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there are people who will just go out and buy the cheaper one.

627
00:41:39,185 --> 00:41:39,425
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.

628
00:41:39,926 --> 00:41:42,629
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that will definitely help sales for them.

629
00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:43,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

630
00:41:43,289 --> 00:41:48,535
[SPEAKER_00]: However, with the way that the market's behaving, isn't that sort of the same nail that the Dreamcast put it in their coffin?

631
00:41:48,555 --> 00:41:48,695
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.

632
00:41:48,755 --> 00:41:49,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't know, don't know.

633
00:41:49,856 --> 00:41:51,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Microsoft, it's very interesting.

634
00:41:51,337 --> 00:41:53,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Microsoft and Sony are really whoring the HD thing.

635
00:41:53,479 --> 00:41:57,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Microsoft is saying you must make your games HD compatible.

636
00:41:57,482 --> 00:42:00,685
[SPEAKER_00]: Microsoft has not made a profit on the Xbox yet.

637
00:42:01,926 --> 00:42:02,446
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

638
00:42:03,607 --> 00:42:07,290
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm smelling some tricks up Nintendo's sleeve, man.

639
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:09,432
[SPEAKER_02]: They just blew it right wide open there.

640
00:42:10,112 --> 00:42:10,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Take it as you will.

641
00:42:11,013 --> 00:42:11,313
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

642
00:42:11,354 --> 00:42:11,814
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

643
00:42:12,617 --> 00:42:13,878
[SPEAKER_03]: More to come, I'm sure.

644
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:16,760
[SPEAKER_03]: One last story tonight for you guys here.

645
00:42:17,761 --> 00:42:21,424
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has to do with Final Fantasy XI because I know Loki is a big Final Fantasy XI whore.

646
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:26,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, another one from Famitsu Magazine who is feeding us with all these articles tonight.

647
00:42:26,889 --> 00:42:29,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy XI producer Hiromichi Takahashi.

648
00:42:30,331 --> 00:42:39,718
[SPEAKER_03]: and Tanaka disclosed that his team is currently working on a new MMO specifically for next generation consoles.

649
00:42:40,238 --> 00:42:42,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Will it be a sequel to Final Fantasy XI?

650
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,323
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unknown at this time, but it will be specifically next generation consoles.

651
00:42:47,284 --> 00:42:50,466
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, I have a brief, really quick, we're going to sum it up.

652
00:42:51,206 --> 00:42:51,646
[SPEAKER_02]: A few things.

653
00:42:51,966 --> 00:42:53,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Television coming to DS.

654
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,768
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks cool.

655
00:42:54,888 --> 00:42:56,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that legit or is that a hack?

656
00:42:56,229 --> 00:42:56,829
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's legit.

657
00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:01,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Two more games also coming from Capcom to the PSP.

658
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:06,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Those would be Mega Man Legends and... God, I can't remember the other one.

659
00:43:06,535 --> 00:43:08,016
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, Mega Man Legends is coming.

660
00:43:08,036 --> 00:43:09,117
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one I was happy about.

661
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:10,918
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think some role-playing game.

662
00:43:11,158 --> 00:43:11,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Fire Emblem or something.

663
00:43:12,899 --> 00:43:13,879
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes.

664
00:43:13,999 --> 00:43:20,081
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, the new Fire Emblem on GameCube is supposed to be really tremendous, really good.

665
00:43:20,642 --> 00:43:23,182
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's been just a jump up for it.

666
00:43:23,362 --> 00:43:23,903
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of people.

667
00:43:25,123 --> 00:43:26,443
[SPEAKER_02]: To be continued on a later podcast.

668
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:37,147
[SPEAKER_02]: And anybody out there listening that's in the PlayStation Portable or DS, you know, home development community, please, please, please port

669
00:43:37,617 --> 00:43:38,697
[SPEAKER_02]: ZZT or Megazooks.

670
00:43:39,197 --> 00:43:39,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

671
00:43:40,458 --> 00:43:40,838
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.

672
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:42,118
[SPEAKER_03]: ZZT would be needed.

673
00:43:42,338 --> 00:43:42,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

674
00:43:43,218 --> 00:43:45,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that's going to do it for another podcast.

675
00:43:45,339 --> 00:43:45,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Final thoughts.

[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:58,421
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I can beat WarioWare Twisted and I hope I can get my Grand Theft Auto San Andreas back because I need to play it and I hope the PC version is done being purchased onto my computer.

678
00:43:59,521 --> 00:44:01,022
