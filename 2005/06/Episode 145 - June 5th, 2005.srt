32
00:05:52,563 --> 00:05:55,345
[SPEAKER_23]: Does anyone actually self-declare themselves as emo?

33
00:05:56,621 --> 00:05:58,622
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I hear a lot of... No, because that's not cool.

34
00:05:58,782 --> 00:06:02,504
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't... I thought emo was, like, the hip thing to do right now, you know?

35
00:06:02,805 --> 00:06:05,146
[SPEAKER_23]: But I don't get it, because everybody makes fun of emo people.

36
00:06:05,246 --> 00:06:07,587
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know anybody that's standing up for emo rights.

37
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,529
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, I don't know anyone that's, like, saying, you know, I'm emo!

38
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:14,812
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, but see, the things that you make fun of now are hip, like, next year.

39
00:06:14,912 --> 00:06:18,334
[SPEAKER_23]: So are you saying that, like, VH1 will do the I Love the Emo next year?

40
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:20,415
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

41
00:06:22,376 --> 00:06:25,898
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember, kids, down the block, not across the street.

42
00:06:29,224 --> 00:06:30,905
[SPEAKER_23]: Wow, think about that one for a minute.

43
00:06:31,326 --> 00:06:34,288
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, also joining us, TechMath's Loki.

44
00:06:35,268 --> 00:06:36,369
[SPEAKER_23]: I love Pizza Hut.

45
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:42,474
[SPEAKER_23]: It's becoming a tradition for you to come over and bring Pizza Hut every Sunday.

46
00:06:42,514 --> 00:06:42,874
[SPEAKER_23]: Twice.

47
00:06:44,515 --> 00:06:45,556
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, twice is enough.

48
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,745
[SPEAKER_23]: I can swear, like, every week you've been in this new studio, you've brought over Pizza Hut.

49
00:06:51,805 --> 00:06:52,906
[SPEAKER_23]: I've only done twice!

50
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:58,954
[SPEAKER_23]: The new studio, by the way, is right across the freeway from Pizza Slut slash Taco Bell.

51
00:06:59,555 --> 00:07:00,136
[SPEAKER_23]: Toxic Hell!

52
00:07:00,236 --> 00:07:02,860
[SPEAKER_23]: It's more like Taco Bell with some pizza.

53
00:07:04,284 --> 00:07:05,465
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, it really is what it is.

54
00:07:05,865 --> 00:07:08,888
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyway, also joining us tonight, we have a very special guest.

55
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:16,214
[SPEAKER_23]: We haven't had many guests in the new studio, so we're very pleased to welcome a staff member of DDRFreak.com.

56
00:07:16,254 --> 00:07:17,395
[SPEAKER_23]: Say hello to Islander.

57
00:07:17,655 --> 00:07:17,956
[SPEAKER_23]: Hello.

58
00:07:19,213 --> 00:07:23,134
[SPEAKER_23]: One of the original ddrfreak.com members Yeah, can you believe that?

59
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:48,263
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm over five years Shit, that's a long time I know, it's a very long time Oh, you know, before I forget I need to give a shout out to OhMyGodIt'sDubes because when I first saw that name I thought it was OhMyGodIt'sBoobs I want to know if that person stole the name from my live journal And so I was just like, wow And then I think somebody else changed their name to OhMyGodIt'sNoobs Which I thought was kind of funny too

60
00:07:51,641 --> 00:07:54,122
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh my God, it's something that rhymes with oobs tonight.

61
00:07:54,202 --> 00:07:56,003
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to say one more thing tonight, though.

62
00:07:56,123 --> 00:07:56,623
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, what's that?

63
00:07:56,863 --> 00:07:58,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Happy birthday to Murdoch.

64
00:07:58,984 --> 00:08:01,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Because he's 39 and ancient.

65
00:08:01,725 --> 00:08:03,005
[SPEAKER_23]: But that's, in U.S.

66

00:08:06,066 --> 00:08:09,808
[SPEAKER_10]: It's June 6th in the U.K., so happy birthday.

69
00:08:09,908 --> 00:08:10,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't he a fictional character?

70
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:13,429
[SPEAKER_09]: I can still say happy birthday.

71
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:14,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Okie doke.

72
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:20,292

[SPEAKER_23]: In this break, we're going to hear some music from Poppin' Music Iroha, also known as Poppin' Music 12, because somebody wanted me to play this song last week and I never got to it.

77
00:08:51,102 --> 00:08:52,143
[SPEAKER_23]: I think it was Siggy or something.

78
00:08:52,163 --> 00:08:55,746
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't even know if he's listening right now, but can't say I didn't honor that request.

79
00:08:56,807 --> 00:08:58,349
[SPEAKER_23]: So, what are you giggling at over there?

80
00:08:58,669 --> 00:09:00,050
[SPEAKER_23]: You're giggling like a little girl.

81
00:09:02,513 --> 00:09:04,555
[SPEAKER_23]: You actually found an animated graphic.

82
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,500
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, somebody posted in the chatroom.

83
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,921
[SPEAKER_23]: Somebody posted that in the chatroom.

84
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:09,561
[SPEAKER_23]: That's brilliant.

85
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:12,963
[SPEAKER_23]: Somebody posted a picture, for those of you that aren't in the chatroom.

86
00:09:13,244 --> 00:09:16,666
[SPEAKER_23]: Somebody actually posted a picture of a hand showing the razor.

87
00:09:17,046 --> 00:09:19,647
[SPEAKER_23]: And it says, remember kids, what is that?

88
00:09:20,128 --> 00:09:20,868
[SPEAKER_23]: Down the street.

89
00:09:21,508 --> 00:09:22,569
[SPEAKER_10]: Down the road, make it count.

90
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:24,350
[SPEAKER_23]: Down the road, not across the street.

91
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,632
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to have to find Sherlock's icon.

92
00:09:26,772 --> 00:09:27,412
[SPEAKER_23]: That's beautiful.

93
00:09:28,713 --> 00:09:29,814
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, we'll be back after this.

94
00:09:29,974 --> 00:09:30,674

00:17:34,329 --> 00:17:35,550
[SPEAKER_18]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

107
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,713
[SPEAKER_23]: We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

108
00:17:38,553 --> 00:17:40,075
[SPEAKER_23]: In that break, Shizuku, the new StartMine remix.

109
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:58,103
[SPEAKER_23]: The new Akira Yamaoka song, Usoki Hyper Rock, and Virokana, all from Papa Music Iroha.

110
00:17:58,543 --> 00:18:02,565
[SPEAKER_23]: Or if you're lazy like me, you can just say Papa Music 12, but technically it's Papa Music Iroha.

111
00:18:03,351 --> 00:18:04,012
[SPEAKER_23]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

112
00:18:31,755 --> 00:18:33,696
[SPEAKER_10]: and all the, and Goonies.

113
00:18:34,616 --> 00:18:35,196
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, that's cool.

114
00:18:35,216 --> 00:18:36,397
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, the Goonies was in Pop Music 10.

115
00:18:36,437 --> 00:18:37,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and I played Star Mine.

116
00:18:37,977 --> 00:18:38,257
[SPEAKER_23]: Did you?

117
00:18:38,377 --> 00:18:39,498
[SPEAKER_23]: I thought you hated that remix.

118
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:41,138
[SPEAKER_10]: I do hate it, but I had to play it.

119
00:18:41,258 --> 00:18:41,659
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, okay.

120
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:45,260
[SPEAKER_10]: It was actually pretty fun and easy.

121
00:18:46,808 --> 00:18:48,629
[SPEAKER_23]: I like poppin' music an awful lot.

122
00:18:48,689 --> 00:18:58,454
[SPEAKER_23]: I sometimes resent it because it seems like there's all these new poppin' music games coming out and then, you know, whereas Guitar Freaks, well, I guess we do have... I keep thinking PS2.

123
00:18:59,995 --> 00:19:01,516
[SPEAKER_23]: But, like, no new DDR lately.

124
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:04,978
[SPEAKER_23]: So I guess I gotta resent poppin' music for being so damn successful.

125
00:19:05,258 --> 00:19:06,419
[SPEAKER_23]: But it really is a cute game.

126
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:09,421
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's really weird that not a lot of arcades here have it.

127
00:19:09,461 --> 00:19:10,621
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, I mean, it is and it isn't.

128
00:19:10,662 --> 00:19:12,443
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, let's face it, the music in poppin' music...

129
00:19:13,473 --> 00:19:16,255
[SPEAKER_23]: is a little scary to, I think, a lot of people.

130
00:19:17,717 --> 00:19:19,498
[SPEAKER_23]: But, I don't know, to me, it's cute.

131
00:19:19,598 --> 00:19:20,119
[SPEAKER_23]: I like it.

132
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,020
[SPEAKER_23]: I think more people should be into it.

133
00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:26,825
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, we're here on Orange Laundry Radio, episode number 145.

134
00:19:27,565 --> 00:19:30,067
[SPEAKER_23]: Somebody in chat told me I said 140 in the opening.

135
00:19:30,147 --> 00:19:30,828
[SPEAKER_23]: Oops, my bad.

136
00:19:30,888 --> 00:19:32,129
[SPEAKER_23]: It's actually 145 tonight.

137
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,791
[SPEAKER_23]: I thought I said 145, but somebody said I said 140.

138
00:19:34,872 --> 00:19:37,734
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know.

139
00:19:37,974 --> 00:19:39,556
[SPEAKER_23]: 145 tonight, that means we're very close to 150.

140
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:39,936
[SPEAKER_23]: Isn't that scary?

141
00:19:42,256 --> 00:19:43,376
[SPEAKER_23]: You know what else is this month?

142
00:19:44,797 --> 00:19:47,178
[SPEAKER_23]: The three-year anniversary of this show.

143
00:19:47,718 --> 00:19:48,898
[SPEAKER_23]: Three years!

144
00:19:49,698 --> 00:19:51,519
[SPEAKER_23]: Come along with us on that BART ride, huh?

145
00:19:51,879 --> 00:19:52,499
[SPEAKER_23]: Seriously.

146
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:54,940
[SPEAKER_23]: And this show is now old enough to attend preschool.

147
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,140
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

148
00:19:57,641 --> 00:20:00,782
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, when I was three, I had a good vocabulary.

149
00:20:01,102 --> 00:20:05,243
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that our vocabulary has grown quite a bit from shit, fuck, damn, you know.

150
00:20:07,404 --> 00:20:09,584
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, but I still like my dick and fart jokes.

151
00:20:10,985 --> 00:20:11,065
[SPEAKER_23]: Pfft.

152
00:20:12,648 --> 00:20:14,149
[SPEAKER_10]: I still like burping on the microphone.

153
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,332
[SPEAKER_10]: It guarantees that the microphone stays in my possession.

154
00:20:17,612 --> 00:20:18,413
[SPEAKER_23]: Listen to the opening.

155
00:20:18,473 --> 00:20:19,594
[SPEAKER_23]: It still has the fart noise in it.

156
00:20:20,434 --> 00:20:25,238
[SPEAKER_23]: And I don't think anybody that was listening to us episode one still listens, which is kind of sad.

157
00:20:26,499 --> 00:20:28,080
[SPEAKER_23]: Wasn't Dark Tetsuya there for episode one?

158
00:20:28,281 --> 00:20:28,621
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

159
00:20:28,641 --> 00:20:29,582
[SPEAKER_23]: I think that's about it.

160
00:20:30,903 --> 00:20:32,764
[SPEAKER_23]: Wasn't he in the room for episode one?

161
00:20:32,804 --> 00:20:34,486
[SPEAKER_23]: Puppy listens still occasionally.

162
00:20:34,786 --> 00:20:35,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

163
00:20:35,627 --> 00:20:38,449
[SPEAKER_23]: Puppy needs to actually do his correspondent job.

164
00:20:38,469 --> 00:20:40,510
[SPEAKER_23]: Bradley, Arcadian42, he was there episode one.

165
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, he was.

166
00:20:41,231 --> 00:20:42,332
[SPEAKER_23]: So we do have a few people.

167
00:20:42,588 --> 00:20:46,329
[SPEAKER_10]: We have some of our old schoolers.

168
00:20:46,949 --> 00:20:51,570
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyway, so we'll be having our three year anniversary special thingy sometime this month.

169
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:55,831
[SPEAKER_23]: Don't know when yet, because I could be out of town one of the weeks this month, so we'll see.

170
00:20:56,071 --> 00:20:56,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Well that's poopy.

171
00:20:57,011 --> 00:21:02,793
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I'm going to be going to LA this month, and then actually in August I'm going to be going to the East Coast.

172
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:06,074
[SPEAKER_23]: I actually have two trips to the East Coast planned right now, which is really weird.

173
00:21:06,194 --> 00:21:07,554
[SPEAKER_23]: One for work and one for leisure.

174
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:16,984
[SPEAKER_23]: I was going to go to the New York area around Labor Day, and now I'm going to be going to Pennsylvania in August.

175
00:21:17,705 --> 00:21:18,606
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's kind of interesting.

176
00:21:18,646 --> 00:21:19,046
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm sorry?

177
00:21:19,246 --> 00:21:25,852
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, I heard about, you know, it's kind of empty, there's not a whole lot there, but I heard about some classic gaming store out there.

178
00:21:26,212 --> 00:21:29,094
[SPEAKER_23]: Somebody had sent me a tip over email, so I'm really curious to check that out.

179
00:21:29,675 --> 00:21:34,519
[SPEAKER_23]: I just hope it doesn't suck like a certain classic video game store we have here in town.

180
00:21:36,533 --> 00:21:37,053
[SPEAKER_23]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

181
00:21:54,153 --> 00:21:57,637
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I will give a short history on that one.

182
00:21:58,478 --> 00:22:04,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Leah, who was the ex-wife partner, went into business with Dan to keep the store alive, and so it became Game On.

183
00:22:06,486 --> 00:22:10,210
[SPEAKER_10]: And then she kind of screwed him up, because she wanted pocket money, because she was dating a rich guy.

184
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,091
[SPEAKER_23]: Uh-huh.

185
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:12,107
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura

186
00:22:41,997 --> 00:22:47,580
[SPEAKER_10]: My week was work, and of course having Monday off, like all of us who work for a bank did.

187
00:22:50,461 --> 00:22:53,183
[SPEAKER_10]: And I really didn't do a whole bunch of anything.

188
00:22:53,323 --> 00:22:55,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Played some PSO, of course.

189
00:22:56,584 --> 00:23:00,927
[SPEAKER_10]: Played some Silent Hill, didn't get too far, so I'm actually at the same save point I was at before.

190
00:23:02,187 --> 00:23:05,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Played a lot of Puyo Puyo, watched Dan beat Fire Emblem.

191
00:23:07,537 --> 00:23:09,640
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your week?

192
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,421
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your day?

193
00:23:27,927 --> 00:23:29,729
[SPEAKER_23]: The weekend was okay.

194
00:23:30,069 --> 00:23:32,432
[SPEAKER_23]: I played a little Final Fantasy yesterday.

195
00:23:34,154 --> 00:23:38,961
[SPEAKER_23]: And then pretty much I had to do stuff for Nelly's birthday.

196
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:40,442
[SPEAKER_23]: So we went to Red Lobster.

197
00:23:40,483 --> 00:23:41,524
[SPEAKER_23]: I hate seafood.

198
00:23:42,182 --> 00:23:42,922
[SPEAKER_23]: But I got steak.

199
00:23:42,982 --> 00:23:43,643
[SPEAKER_23]: Steak's good.

200
00:23:43,903 --> 00:23:46,284
[SPEAKER_23]: And then, um... What else?

201
00:23:46,664 --> 00:23:47,965
[SPEAKER_23]: Uh... Not too much.

202
00:23:48,045 --> 00:23:50,586
[SPEAKER_23]: I think during the week was just kind of... Eh.

203
00:23:50,606 --> 00:23:51,826
[SPEAKER_23]: It was kind of slow.

204
00:23:52,447 --> 00:23:53,707
[SPEAKER_23]: It was nice having a short week, though.

205
00:23:53,847 --> 00:24:01,771
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, I've got to go back to Red Lobster at some point, because there's a waiter there, and I think he's gay, because he was giving us all this free food.

206
00:24:01,811 --> 00:24:03,932
[SPEAKER_23]: It was me and two of my gay friends went over to Red Lobster.

207
00:24:03,972 --> 00:24:06,773
[SPEAKER_23]: He started giving us, like, all this free food and didn't charge us for it.

208
00:24:06,793 --> 00:24:08,074
[SPEAKER_23]: We didn't get charged for drinks.

209
00:24:08,534 --> 00:24:10,295
[SPEAKER_23]: He brought us, like, double sides and stuff.

210
00:24:11,545 --> 00:24:15,529
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll just... Highlander's getting all kind of gay as he says, I want to go with you.

211
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:20,413
[SPEAKER_23]: No, I swear, there's like this pink mafia out there.

212
00:24:20,733 --> 00:24:23,856
[SPEAKER_23]: And, you know, I'm going to expose the secret here.

213
00:24:25,017 --> 00:24:34,325
[SPEAKER_23]: If you get the slightest inclination that somebody at a particular service industry, like, you know, at a store, at a restaurant, might be, you know, gay...

214
00:24:35,885 --> 00:24:38,747
[SPEAKER_23]: Flirt with them because you'll get a discount or something.

215
00:24:38,867 --> 00:24:45,711
[SPEAKER_23]: Or if they suspect that you're at least like a gay rights supporter, you can get like breaks and stuff.

216
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:46,231
[SPEAKER_23]: It's really weird.

217
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:49,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that mean we need to go into Red Lobster wearing a shirt that says hag on it?

218
00:24:49,854 --> 00:24:51,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

219
00:24:51,815 --> 00:24:53,376
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll tell you which waiter it is too.

220
00:24:53,396 --> 00:24:53,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

221
00:24:56,618 --> 00:24:58,179
[SPEAKER_23]: I swear there's like a pink mafia out there.

222
00:25:00,954 --> 00:25:01,655
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know about that.

223
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:06,476
[SPEAKER_23]: But anyways, other than that, really, nothing has been going on.

224
00:25:06,496 --> 00:25:08,416
[SPEAKER_23]: It's pretty much just been work stuff.

225
00:25:08,796 --> 00:25:14,758
[SPEAKER_23]: I know we've got our Dallas people coming out in the week of the 20th, which I think is a couple weeks away now.

226
00:25:15,498 --> 00:25:20,559
[SPEAKER_23]: So they're gonna come out to which I guess I have to play them at some games or something, kick their ass, just because that's

227
00:25:21,161 --> 00:25:24,622
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, standard company procedure.

228
00:25:25,222 --> 00:25:33,025
[SPEAKER_23]: And then today I went to Pizza Hut and I got two things of breadsticks and the pepperoni pizza.

229
00:25:34,126 --> 00:25:35,866
[SPEAKER_23]: I've eaten half of that.

230
00:25:36,106 --> 00:25:40,308
[SPEAKER_23]: I still have one thing of breadsticks left, which I'm debating about keeping for later on.

231
00:25:41,128 --> 00:25:42,529
[SPEAKER_23]: Because they're damn good.

232
00:25:42,729 --> 00:25:43,669
[SPEAKER_23]: Fascinating, really.

233
00:25:44,449 --> 00:25:45,430
[SPEAKER_23]: It is fascinating.

234
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:48,311
[SPEAKER_23]: Then today I had to build a computer for my sister and

235
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:59,061
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know where half of my motherboards went, but I have a lot of crappy computer parts, so she's going to get a computer that's about comparable with what we used to run the show on.

236
00:26:00,923 --> 00:26:03,586
[SPEAKER_23]: The reason I say it's comparable is because it's almost out of the same parts.

237
00:26:04,347 --> 00:26:04,928
[SPEAKER_23]: And, um...

238
00:26:06,223 --> 00:26:07,304
[SPEAKER_23]: I have a complaint about that movie.

239
00:26:07,324 --> 00:26:07,684
[SPEAKER_23]: What's that?

240
00:26:34,156 --> 00:26:35,617
[SPEAKER_23]: I haven't seen it yet, so no spoilers.

241
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,377
[SPEAKER_10]: General Grievous.

242
00:26:37,658 --> 00:26:40,900
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard how just kick-ass he was in the Clone Wars cartoon.

243
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:49,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, he... Damn it, it's hard for me to make my major complaint or else I'll spill it for Rob.

244
00:26:49,745 --> 00:26:50,165
[SPEAKER_22]: That's okay.

245
00:26:50,445 --> 00:26:53,207
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's just something about Obi-Wan riding a giant iguana.

246
00:26:55,427 --> 00:26:57,348
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, there was some iguana writing.

247
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:58,409
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know.

248
00:26:58,469 --> 00:26:58,869
[SPEAKER_23]: It's weird.

249
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,030
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's weird.

250
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:00,611
[SPEAKER_23]: Interesting.

251
00:27:01,031 --> 00:27:02,572
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm supposed to see it Tuesday.

252
00:27:02,972 --> 00:27:03,153
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

253
00:27:03,313 --> 00:27:06,055
[SPEAKER_23]: Me and some of the Pink Mafia are going to check it out.

254
00:27:07,576 --> 00:27:09,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Why aren't you listening to Pump Up the Volume?

255
00:27:09,957 --> 00:27:11,118
[SPEAKER_23]: Maybe we'll get in free.

256
00:27:11,198 --> 00:27:11,559
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know.

257
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,662
[SPEAKER_23]: Because I'm trying to revive my own show at some point.

258
00:27:16,822 --> 00:27:19,204
[SPEAKER_23]: So between that and karaoke, I don't have a lot of free weeknights.

259
00:27:21,701 --> 00:27:23,623
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't make me, like, haunt you or something.

260
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:24,904
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll TiVo it.

261
00:27:25,224 --> 00:27:35,534
[SPEAKER_23]: Speaking of haunting, we're supposed to be scheduling another trip out to some remote cemetery that's down by Dry Town in Sutter Creek.

262
00:27:36,275 --> 00:27:39,278
[SPEAKER_23]: And apparently it's on some guy's land and we won't get bothered out there.

263
00:27:39,618 --> 00:27:41,000
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, whatever happened to the ghost hunting?

264
00:27:41,720 --> 00:28:02,928
[SPEAKER_23]: It's been on a hiatus for a while, just because A, I'm moving and everything, and B, we've been trying to get in contact with local members of, I forget, there's an actual organization that people sign up for, which I really don't think there's a big deal behind it, but it's just like, they have standard protocol to take or something like that.

265
00:28:03,129 --> 00:28:05,509
[SPEAKER_23]: So when you go ghost hunting, is it like Luigi's Mansion?

266
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,390
[SPEAKER_23]: No, it's not like Luigi's Mansion.

267
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,531
[SPEAKER_23]: Did you take a vacuum cleaner?

268
00:28:08,551 --> 00:28:09,331
[SPEAKER_23]: I know!

269
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:13,140
[SPEAKER_23]: No, it's not like that at all.

270
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:20,664
[SPEAKER_23]: It's mainly, it's just kind of like surveying, basically just take readings of areas and whatnot.

271
00:28:21,044 --> 00:28:37,973
[SPEAKER_23]: The thing that I would probably be doing, though, that most normal people would be doing is they usually don't try to disturb the area, whereas I believe it's like if you want the rat to come out of the woodpile, you've got to start shaking the woodpile for that to happen.

272
00:28:38,773 --> 00:28:42,054
[SPEAKER_23]: So, same sense in this.

273
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:45,015
[SPEAKER_23]: If you want something to happen, you gotta piss it off.

274
00:28:47,957 --> 00:28:48,697
[SPEAKER_16]: Mario!

275
00:28:49,777 --> 00:28:54,859
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyways, but no, supposedly we're just gonna go chill down there.

276
00:28:54,879 --> 00:28:58,380
[SPEAKER_23]: We were gonna do an all nighter thing, but my fiance didn't like that idea.

277
00:28:58,781 --> 00:29:03,422
[SPEAKER_23]: So, instead we're gonna go down there at dusk and hang out during the night for a little bit.

278
00:29:03,983 --> 00:29:05,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Should we go ghost hunting in Alabama?

279
00:29:06,123 --> 00:29:07,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we actually have old cemeteries.

280
00:29:08,342 --> 00:29:09,762
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, this is an old cemetery, too.

281
00:29:10,422 --> 00:29:13,843
[SPEAKER_10]: These are from, like, the 1700s and 1600s.

282
00:29:13,903 --> 00:29:15,763
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't want to talk to old people.

283
00:29:15,783 --> 00:29:18,004
[SPEAKER_23]: It's all fun.

284
00:29:18,064 --> 00:29:19,064
[SPEAKER_23]: No, anyways, I don't know.

285
00:29:19,084 --> 00:29:20,004
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a picture of a ghost.

286
00:29:22,805 --> 00:29:25,725
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, but you know everyone has a picture of Michael Jackson, so it's okay.

287
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:28,866
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyways, that's all.

288
00:29:29,806 --> 00:29:30,086
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm done.

289
00:29:31,906 --> 00:29:33,866
[SPEAKER_23]: Islander, how was your week and how was your day?

290
00:29:35,267 --> 00:29:37,067
[SPEAKER_24]: My week started off at Fanime, actually.

291
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:41,568
[SPEAKER_24]: A big anime convention down in the Bay Area.

292
00:29:42,368 --> 00:29:46,709
[SPEAKER_24]: And woke up, unfortunately, with a hangover.

293
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,270
[SPEAKER_24]: Too many tequila shots, not a good thing.

294
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:55,372
[SPEAKER_24]: And either my roommate or someone down there got me sick.

295
00:29:55,792 --> 00:29:57,532
[SPEAKER_24]: So the entire week I've been fighting a cold.

296
00:29:57,732 --> 00:30:00,193
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm pretty much getting over it at this point.

297
00:30:01,853 --> 00:30:04,914
[SPEAKER_24]: Today, I was in the mood for Pump It Up.

298
00:30:06,112 --> 00:30:07,293
[SPEAKER_24]: Another dance simulation game.

299
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:09,134
[SPEAKER_24]: Pump It Up, really?

300
00:30:09,154 --> 00:30:09,734
[SPEAKER_24]: I've never heard of it.

301
00:30:10,154 --> 00:30:11,015
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm kidding.

302
00:30:11,655 --> 00:30:12,295
[SPEAKER_24]: For those of you who don't know.

303
00:30:12,335 --> 00:30:14,016
[SPEAKER_23]: I think most of our listeners know Pump It Up.

304
00:30:14,036 --> 00:30:14,556
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm pretty sure they do.

305
00:30:14,576 --> 00:30:14,957
[SPEAKER_23]: I hope you do.

306
00:30:15,197 --> 00:30:15,757
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm pretty sure they do.

307
00:30:15,777 --> 00:30:17,558
[SPEAKER_23]: If you don't, Korean five panels.

308
00:30:18,579 --> 00:30:19,279
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, that's it.

309
00:30:19,379 --> 00:30:19,899
[SPEAKER_23]: That's all I need to know.

310
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,500
[SPEAKER_24]: So I had to drive all the way down to Florin Mall.

311
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,701
[SPEAKER_24]: They still have Pump It Up there?

312
00:30:23,981 --> 00:30:26,263
[SPEAKER_24]: They still have Pump It Up there, and they have a Dance Freaks.

313
00:30:27,083 --> 00:30:27,783
[SPEAKER_24]: OMG!

314
00:30:28,424 --> 00:30:30,445
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, the Korean version of Dance Mania X.

315
00:30:31,295 --> 00:30:32,636
[SPEAKER_24]: OMG, I have to go play this.

316
00:30:32,876 --> 00:30:34,097
[SPEAKER_24]: Do they have different songs in it?

317
00:30:34,498 --> 00:30:37,720
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, it's basically DMX1 with a few K-pop songs thrown in.

318
00:30:38,281 --> 00:30:39,422
[SPEAKER_24]: Are any decent K-pop songs?

319
00:30:40,022 --> 00:30:42,764
[SPEAKER_24]: Um... There's a few good ones.

320
00:30:43,605 --> 00:30:44,806
[SPEAKER_24]: No, unfortunately, Caution is not in it.

321
00:30:44,826 --> 00:30:45,586
[SPEAKER_24]: How about Starion?

322
00:30:45,626 --> 00:30:46,767
[SPEAKER_24]: It's in every other K-pop song.

323
00:30:47,268 --> 00:30:48,068
[SPEAKER_24]: Is Starion in it, really?

324
00:30:48,108 --> 00:30:51,711
[SPEAKER_24]: No, Starion's not in it, but there is a Baek Ji Young song called Dash.

325
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:57,696
[SPEAKER_24]: There is a few songs... I know it was in another game.

326
00:30:57,716 --> 00:30:57,756
[SPEAKER_24]: Um...

327
00:31:00,816 --> 00:31:07,558
[SPEAKER_24]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

328
00:31:23,103 --> 00:31:24,844
[SPEAKER_24]: I was watching it going, what the hell?

329
00:31:24,864 --> 00:31:26,365
[SPEAKER_24]: I was expecting it, because...

330
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:51,628
[SPEAKER_23]: Bakwa is such a kind of like, I don't know, it strikes me as a very angsty kind of song.

331
00:31:52,468 --> 00:31:57,512
[SPEAKER_23]: And I was expecting her to be kicking some ass or something, not freaking sitting on the rock being the Little Mermaid.

332
00:31:59,073 --> 00:31:59,513
[SPEAKER_23]: Exactly.

333
00:32:00,754 --> 00:32:05,818
[SPEAKER_23]: I was expecting her little crab friend and fish flounder to pop up and start singing along, you know?

334
00:32:06,638 --> 00:32:11,962
[SPEAKER_25]: But yeah, that's pretty much it, and now I'm here.

335
00:32:13,171 --> 00:32:14,371
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, I'm glad you could make time for us.

336
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:15,492
[SPEAKER_24]: That's very nice.

337
00:32:16,012 --> 00:32:19,793
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm actually trying to read up on what's going on with that Pump It Up tourney.

338
00:32:21,033 --> 00:32:23,793
[SPEAKER_23]: I know there was one a couple weeks ago in Dallas, Texas.

339
00:32:23,953 --> 00:32:24,694
[SPEAKER_23]: It was going on.

340
00:32:25,014 --> 00:32:28,454
[SPEAKER_23]: It was one of those qualifiers for the big Pump It Up tournament in Korea.

341
00:32:28,795 --> 00:32:32,215
[SPEAKER_23]: But I haven't heard anything else about future qualifiers since then.

342
00:32:33,856 --> 00:32:36,976
[SPEAKER_23]: I'd be really mad if that's the only qualifying tourney in the United States.

343
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:37,437
[SPEAKER_23]: That would suck.

344
00:32:37,477 --> 00:32:39,337
[SPEAKER_23]: But there's got to be one that happens in the...

345
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:42,286
[SPEAKER_23]: in the bay at some point.

346
00:32:43,047 --> 00:32:47,710
[SPEAKER_24]: Dallas is right in the middle for this big country for everyone to go to.

347
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:56,616
[SPEAKER_23]: I was looking over on Mastiff's site to see if they have anything on it, and they are still plugging a smidget being at the Metreon on February 11th.

348
00:32:58,057 --> 00:33:00,859
[SPEAKER_23]: Which, by the way, I didn't even know the Metreon had Pump It Up.

349
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:01,600
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't think they do.

350
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,981
[SPEAKER_23]: So they must have wheeled in a machine for that.

351
00:33:05,182 --> 00:33:06,783
[SPEAKER_23]: Unless they replaced one of their other machines.

352
00:33:07,464 --> 00:33:07,824
[SPEAKER_23]: Not sure.

353
00:33:07,904 --> 00:33:10,526
[SPEAKER_23]: Now I'm trying to check out Amaro's site and see if they have anything going on.

354
00:33:11,297 --> 00:33:13,358
[SPEAKER_23]: And I don't see anything.

355
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:17,759
[SPEAKER_23]: But I'll keep looking.

356
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:19,199
[SPEAKER_23]: Maybe somebody in our chat room knows.

357
00:33:19,259 --> 00:33:21,020
[SPEAKER_23]: If anybody in our chat room knows, feel free to share.

358
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:24,080
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll read it on air and try to get what's going on with that tournament.

359
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:28,241
[SPEAKER_23]: Because I'm sure a lot of people that aren't just in Texas want to qualify what's going on there.

360
00:33:31,229 --> 00:33:32,951
[SPEAKER_23]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

361
00:33:46,769 --> 00:33:47,510
[SPEAKER_23]: That's the spirit.

362
00:33:48,991 --> 00:33:51,612
[SPEAKER_23]: The goth club was actually quite a bit of fun.

363
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,673
[SPEAKER_23]: I was wearing one of the brightest shirts there.

364
00:33:53,994 --> 00:33:56,355
[SPEAKER_23]: I was wearing my shirt... You could see you from across the room.

365
00:33:56,435 --> 00:34:04,980
[SPEAKER_23]: I was wearing... See, because most people at the goth club wear all black, or sometimes, like, the gothy goths wear white, because, you know, they're going to be different.

366
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:13,125
[SPEAKER_23]: I wore a bright-ass red shirt, because it was my English.com shirt, and it said, I hate myself and I want to die, because I thought that would be appropriate for the goth club.

367
00:34:14,048 --> 00:34:14,889
[SPEAKER_23]: Team America World Police

368
00:34:33,324 --> 00:34:34,364
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm so ornery.

369
00:34:34,524 --> 00:34:36,785
[SPEAKER_10]: And you were watching South Park.

370
00:34:36,805 --> 00:34:37,925
[SPEAKER_23]: South Park, the movie, yeah.

371
00:34:38,565 --> 00:34:39,906
[SPEAKER_23]: No, I went and saw Crash.

372
00:34:39,946 --> 00:34:42,566
[SPEAKER_23]: I think that was on Monday, which was good.

373
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:50,268
[SPEAKER_23]: It's just very unapologetic and in-your-face type thing where some of the language is very raw.

374
00:34:51,049 --> 00:34:59,951
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a movie that deals with racism, so if the N-word makes you uncomfortable or any of the other various racial slurs, Loki, you'd have no problem with this movie.

375
00:35:01,011 --> 00:35:03,432
[SPEAKER_23]: If any of those various racial slurs make you uncomfortable.

376
00:35:04,612 --> 00:35:06,113
[SPEAKER_23]: But actually, it was a really good movie.

377
00:35:06,193 --> 00:35:06,753
[SPEAKER_23]: It was really good.

378
00:35:06,793 --> 00:35:07,293
[SPEAKER_23]: Really well done.

379
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:08,333
[SPEAKER_23]: So I recommend it.

380
00:35:09,573 --> 00:35:11,794
[SPEAKER_23]: Otherwise, not a whole lot going on.

381
00:35:13,014 --> 00:35:16,355
[SPEAKER_23]: I went out to play In the Groove, actually, twice this week.

382
00:35:16,655 --> 00:35:17,696
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes!

383
00:35:18,436 --> 00:35:19,556
[SPEAKER_23]: I just... Well, you know what?

384
00:35:19,696 --> 00:35:22,337
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm loving the USB support thing because...

385
00:35:23,417 --> 00:35:31,881
[SPEAKER_23]: One reason I like the way In The Groove has its workout mode set up is that you don't have to do a special mode to have it count your calories.

386
00:35:32,341 --> 00:35:34,502
[SPEAKER_23]: It actually counts your calories while you're playing a normal game.

387
00:35:34,782 --> 00:35:36,443
[SPEAKER_23]: This kind of bugs me about DDR.

388
00:35:36,463 --> 00:35:37,003
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know why.

389
00:35:37,043 --> 00:35:38,444
[SPEAKER_23]: It's such a little-ass problem.

390
00:35:38,764 --> 00:35:43,366
[SPEAKER_23]: But I wish that, and I think the only game that ever did this was Disney's Rave.

391
00:35:43,867 --> 00:35:47,768
[SPEAKER_23]: Funny enough, Disney's Rave is the only DDR game that did a lot of things correctly.

392
00:35:47,848 --> 00:35:49,149
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's say Dance Magic...

393
00:35:49,669 --> 00:35:53,190
[SPEAKER_23]: and then it counts your calories no matter what mode you're playing in.

394
00:35:53,511 --> 00:36:10,757
[SPEAKER_23]: The reason why I don't like workout mode in like PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions is that if you play in workout mode, you don't unlock new songs, you don't technically save your grades or your scores or anything, so there's no point in playing in workout mode unless you are strictly there to burn calories.

395
00:36:11,077 --> 00:36:13,258
[SPEAKER_23]: But I like to unlock songs as I play DDR.

396
00:36:13,278 --> 00:36:15,299
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know about the rest of you, but that's part of the fun of it, so...

397
00:36:16,167 --> 00:36:19,549
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyway, so In The Groove has the fantastic USB support.

398
00:36:19,909 --> 00:36:22,691
[SPEAKER_23]: Say what you will about the game, but the USB support is fantastic.

399
00:36:23,531 --> 00:36:25,572
[SPEAKER_23]: So, I've been having fun with that.

400
00:36:26,193 --> 00:36:26,953
[SPEAKER_23]: The game itself, eh.

401
00:36:28,034 --> 00:36:35,057
[SPEAKER_23]: It's just kind of holding me over until there's a new DDR, which, I don't know, I'm not going to hold my breath at this point, but maybe some home versions this fall.

402
00:36:35,538 --> 00:36:35,878
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll see.

403
00:36:36,118 --> 00:36:37,439
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, we know there's home versions, but you know.

404
00:36:37,699 --> 00:36:39,520
[SPEAKER_23]: I want new arcade stuff really bad.

405
00:36:41,061 --> 00:36:43,202
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

406
00:36:44,863 --> 00:36:45,383
[SPEAKER_23]: Moving on.

407
00:36:47,048 --> 00:36:49,449
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's see what's going on in the Bomani world news-wise.

408
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:53,031
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought we had a... I know two things.

409
00:36:53,191 --> 00:36:53,591
[SPEAKER_23]: What's that?

410
00:36:53,731 --> 00:36:55,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Jack and... No, I'm kidding.

411
00:36:55,912 --> 00:37:00,174
[SPEAKER_23]: It's really a slow... Video gaming altogether is kind of a slow news period right now.

412
00:37:00,214 --> 00:37:00,895
[SPEAKER_23]: It's kind of sad.

413
00:37:00,955 --> 00:37:02,195
[SPEAKER_10]: It's on vacation after E3.

414
00:37:02,235 --> 00:37:03,776
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, it really is.

415
00:37:04,536 --> 00:37:09,879
[SPEAKER_23]: Checking some of the headlines recently over on TED-DDR Freak, which, by the way, replays our show on Friday nights.

416
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:11,940
[SPEAKER_23]: Those lovely folks over there.

417
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:12,340
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

418
00:37:13,241 --> 00:37:13,341
[SPEAKER_23]: Um...

419
00:37:14,341 --> 00:37:20,104
[SPEAKER_23]: They actually had like a legal perspective, explain the Konami vs. Rockstar thing.

420
00:37:20,924 --> 00:37:29,388
[SPEAKER_23]: Which, if you were totally confused by the lawsuit, I would hope that if you listened to our program a couple weeks ago when that subject first came up, that we helped explain things for you.

421
00:37:29,428 --> 00:37:38,452
[SPEAKER_23]: But if you're still lost, they kind of had somebody that is in law school or recently finished with law school try to kind of explain it a little more.

422
00:37:38,933 --> 00:37:41,254
[SPEAKER_23]: So it's a fun read, so check that out.

423
00:37:41,994 --> 00:37:49,580
[SPEAKER_23]: Also very interesting that's brought up in there is that Roxor is supposed to have like 20 days to do a response to the lawsuit.

424
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,804
[SPEAKER_23]: So it'll be interesting because sometime this week, even though it's been over 20 days, it might be 20 business days.

425
00:37:54,844 --> 00:37:55,464
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know how it works.

426
00:37:55,844 --> 00:38:04,351
[SPEAKER_23]: But somebody, we're thinking this week we might get some more information on exactly what Roxor's comment's going to be to that.

427
00:38:04,951 --> 00:38:08,293
[SPEAKER_23]: Or as I predict, the out-of-court settlement will happen very soon.

428
00:38:09,594 --> 00:38:09,995
[SPEAKER_23]: But we'll see.

429
00:38:11,394 --> 00:38:21,515
[SPEAKER_23]: And then of course there were some new trailers posted over on IGN.com for DDR Extreme 2 and Ultramix 3, which really don't show anything new as far as I remember from looking at the trailers.

430
00:38:21,535 --> 00:38:22,758
[SPEAKER_23]: There's really nothing new in it.

431
00:38:23,457 --> 00:38:29,698
[SPEAKER_23]: and then a Beatmania trailer is available over on Games Are Fun but it's the same damn thing they showed at E3.

432
00:38:29,938 --> 00:38:30,759
[SPEAKER_23]: Exactly the same thing.

433
00:38:30,859 --> 00:38:31,919
[SPEAKER_23]: Really not a lot new.

434
00:38:32,899 --> 00:38:38,240
[SPEAKER_23]: New news possibly on Xtreme 2 at Comic Con if it's going to be anything like last year.

435
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:43,821
[SPEAKER_23]: You remember last year at Comic Con in July in San Diego they actually brought a build of Xtreme.

436
00:38:44,621 --> 00:38:47,742
[SPEAKER_23]: Last year it was Xtreme and we found out some new songs that way.

437
00:38:47,822 --> 00:38:52,163
[SPEAKER_23]: So we're hoping that this year they'll do the same thing and we'll find out some new stuff for Xtreme 2.

438
00:38:53,482 --> 00:38:53,983
[SPEAKER_23]: We shall see.

439
00:38:55,144 --> 00:38:56,045
[SPEAKER_23]: It will be very interesting.

440
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:35,125
[SPEAKER_23]: and then we'll also get into tonight's cage match very soon as well as your calls via the skype line www.orangeloungeradio.com by the way we're looking into this new thing we might do I actually this is the first time I have even said this to the others because Jason brought this to my attention just like two days ago but there's actually this new thing called skype in where we could get a phone number and then if somebody calls the phone number it'll come in on skype

441
00:39:36,396 --> 00:39:37,977
[SPEAKER_23]: So we'll probably be looking into that.

442
00:39:38,037 --> 00:39:45,859
[SPEAKER_23]: So possibly in the very near future, Orange Lounge Radio, for those of you that don't get the Skype thing or don't want it, we will have a phone number that you can call to be on the program.

443
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:48,360
[SPEAKER_23]: So that will be a very cool addition.

444
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:48,780
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll see.

445
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,080
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, anyway.

446
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:53,401
[SPEAKER_23]: After this break, we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio.

447
00:39:53,422 --> 00:39:56,202
[SPEAKER_23]: And this break, music from 2DX Night Style.

448
00:39:56,683 --> 00:40:03,345
[SPEAKER_23]: Started off with a popular song from 2DX Night Style that we haven't played in a while, so I thought you kids would enjoy this.

449
00:40:03,605 --> 00:40:04,225
[SPEAKER_23]: Lionski.

450
00:40:59,922 --> 00:41:00,724
Thank you for watching!

451
00:44:38,607 --> 00:44:39,567
Thanks for watching!

452
00:45:48,646 --> 00:45:49,286
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for watching!

453
00:47:50,094 --> 00:47:59,102
[SPEAKER_12]: And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's favorite perverse Bomani band, Erotic.

454
00:47:59,523 --> 00:48:00,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Do it all night.

455
00:48:00,704 --> 00:48:01,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Do it with me.

456
00:48:02,025 --> 00:48:03,446
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, that was awful.

457
00:48:03,526 --> 00:48:04,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Bloody terrible.

458
00:48:04,447 --> 00:48:05,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you take vocal lessons?

459
00:48:05,868 --> 00:48:06,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Kill your teacher.

460
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:08,370
[SPEAKER_08]: In the heat of the night.

461
00:48:08,831 --> 00:48:11,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, God, I think my ears are bleeding.

462
00:48:12,254 --> 00:48:12,935
[SPEAKER_08]: I liked it.

463
00:48:13,455 --> 00:48:14,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut the bloody hell up, Paula.

464
00:48:15,096 --> 00:48:15,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Next.

465
00:48:17,438 --> 00:48:20,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, that was cool.

466
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you even know why you're here?

467
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,841
[SPEAKER_08]: That was just bloody pathetic.

468
00:48:24,901 --> 00:48:25,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Next!

469
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,802
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, do it with me.

470
00:48:30,743 --> 00:48:32,003
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, yes, that's it!

471
00:48:32,363 --> 00:48:33,523
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a winner!

472
00:48:34,324 --> 00:48:38,425
[SPEAKER_12]: A Star is Born, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

473
00:48:39,895 --> 00:48:40,915
[SPEAKER_23]: God, that promo's old.

474
00:48:41,575 --> 00:48:42,696
[SPEAKER_23]: I thought with the whole American Idol.

475
00:48:42,716 --> 00:48:43,416
[SPEAKER_23]: That is really old.

476
00:48:43,496 --> 00:48:48,417
[SPEAKER_23]: I thought with all the American Idol stuff, it's not even that good compared to some of our other promos.

477
00:48:48,817 --> 00:48:56,819
[SPEAKER_23]: But I thought with the whole American Idol thing going on this past couple weeks that it was time to play that again.

478
00:48:57,099 --> 00:49:00,000
[SPEAKER_23]: So congratulations to Carrie Underwood, your erotic pop idol.

479
00:49:00,868 --> 00:49:02,529
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm sure we'll be in Playboy in a matter of years.

480
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:04,791
[SPEAKER_23]: Because that's where most of those pop idols are at.

481
00:49:04,811 --> 00:49:06,452
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't even followed it since Carrie.

482
00:49:06,472 --> 00:49:08,074
[SPEAKER_23]: Carrie Underwood is useless.

483
00:49:08,954 --> 00:49:11,276
[SPEAKER_23]: I can sing country music, but can you sing pop music?

484
00:49:11,596 --> 00:49:14,919
[SPEAKER_23]: I can sing country music, but can you sing pop music?

485
00:49:15,339 --> 00:49:15,840
[SPEAKER_22]: Country?

486
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:17,181
[SPEAKER_23]: No, pop music.

487
00:49:18,281 --> 00:49:18,622
[SPEAKER_23]: Pop!

488
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:20,163
[SPEAKER_23]: That's all she could do.

489
00:49:20,263 --> 00:49:21,664
[SPEAKER_23]: Every song she sang was a country song.

490
00:49:21,804 --> 00:49:24,066
[SPEAKER_23]: She's so going to be on The Surreal Life in two years.

491
00:49:24,921 --> 00:49:27,723
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't followed it since I bought Clay's album.

492
00:49:28,343 --> 00:49:30,605
[SPEAKER_10]: I did buy Clay's album and I was proud of it.

493
00:49:31,585 --> 00:49:32,826
[SPEAKER_10]: Because he has a good voice.

494
00:49:34,507 --> 00:49:35,508
[SPEAKER_10]: But he has a really good voice.

495
00:49:36,589 --> 00:49:38,330
[SPEAKER_23]: What happened to Clay Aiken?

496
00:49:40,111 --> 00:49:41,312
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, but he's pretty.

497
00:49:41,792 --> 00:49:43,133
[SPEAKER_10]: He's invisible.

498
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:44,394
[SPEAKER_24]: We don't know what happened to him.

499
00:49:47,042 --> 00:49:53,230
[SPEAKER_23]: You have to understand, what happened was, is there was a rival, you know, between, you know... Ruben and Clay?

500
00:49:53,451 --> 00:49:57,115
[SPEAKER_23]: Biggie, Ruben, and Clay, you see, and, you know, they gunned him down.

501
00:49:58,437 --> 00:50:00,300
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, I figured that Ruben just ate Clay.

502
00:50:01,778 --> 00:50:13,926
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, Ruben was having, I think, to visit a nutritionist because he was saying he was comfortable in his own body, but he was actually starting to develop heart issues and things last I checked.

503
00:50:14,206 --> 00:50:15,327
[SPEAKER_10]: We saw people going to die?

504
00:50:16,387 --> 00:50:19,249
[SPEAKER_10]: He's the people who's going to, I don't know.

505
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:25,973
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's been a big health concern regarding the fact that he's basically put on 100 pounds since he won.

506
00:50:26,334 --> 00:50:26,774
[SPEAKER_22]: It's too bad.

507
00:50:27,074 --> 00:50:27,774
[SPEAKER_23]: Dang! 101?

508
00:50:28,975 --> 00:50:31,558
[SPEAKER_23]: He needs to start playing some DDR.

509
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:37,904
[SPEAKER_23]: The bigger I am, the bigger I am on the charts.

510
00:50:39,025 --> 00:50:40,786
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that he's gained a lot of weight since then.

511
00:50:41,387 --> 00:50:42,428
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at the comparison pictures.

512
00:50:43,549 --> 00:50:44,570
[SPEAKER_10]: He's a big boy now.

513
00:50:45,951 --> 00:50:46,331
[SPEAKER_23]: Wow.

514
00:50:46,892 --> 00:50:51,516
[SPEAKER_23]: Who was that rap artist way back in the day that used to be like... Heavy D?

515
00:50:51,696 --> 00:50:54,379
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, Heavy D. Dude, Heavy D was cool.

516
00:50:56,124 --> 00:51:01,771
[SPEAKER_23]: Dude, Biz Markie was on that VH1 Get Fit show.

517
00:51:01,831 --> 00:51:02,772
[SPEAKER_23]: Celebrity Fit Club.

518
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:04,134
[SPEAKER_10]: I love Biz Markie.

519
00:51:04,635 --> 00:51:05,496
[SPEAKER_10]: And the Snapple Lady.

520
00:51:06,977 --> 00:51:07,658
[SPEAKER_10]: She was on that too.

521
00:51:07,698 --> 00:51:08,439
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, she was.

522
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:09,721
[SPEAKER_23]: As well as Mia Tyler and

523
00:51:10,165 --> 00:51:10,465
[SPEAKER_23]: VH1 shows

524
00:51:27,164 --> 00:51:31,826
[SPEAKER_23]: In the same house with Omarosa from The Apprentice and Janice Dickinson for America's Next Top Model.

525
00:51:32,146 --> 00:51:37,347
[SPEAKER_23]: Which, by the way, if America's Next Top Model is not your guilty pleasure show, it should be.

526
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:40,048
[SPEAKER_23]: Because that show, what a bunch of bitches.

527
00:51:40,808 --> 00:51:41,428
[SPEAKER_23]: Seriously.

528
00:51:41,508 --> 00:51:45,770
[SPEAKER_23]: Nelly was watching this one show yesterday on VH1.

529
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:47,230
[SPEAKER_23]: I guess it's called Strip Search.

530
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:49,111
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm surprised, Rob, you haven't heard of it.

531
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:53,252
[SPEAKER_23]: Actually, my roommate watches Strip Search every week.

532
00:51:54,492 --> 00:51:56,133
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, I was like, this is weird.

533
00:51:56,173 --> 00:51:57,534
[SPEAKER_23]: He's probably watching it right now.

534
00:51:57,554 --> 00:52:02,776
[SPEAKER_23]: I was overhearing it while I was, you know, uploading my MySpace site, which I'll have to cover later.

535
00:52:03,236 --> 00:52:10,780
[SPEAKER_23]: And, um, so, it's just like, I guess they make these guys do, like, their strip dances in, like, the middle of, like, wherever they're working or whatever.

536
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:15,962
[SPEAKER_23]: And I guess they can go and compete to become, like, the next, um... Thunder from Down Under.

537
00:52:16,002 --> 00:52:18,163
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, Thunder from Down Under show.

538
00:52:18,964 --> 00:52:19,324
[SPEAKER_23]: But, um...

539
00:52:20,758 --> 00:52:23,320
[SPEAKER_23]: I've got thunder down under, it's called my fat thighs.

540
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:24,541
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know about you.

541
00:52:24,561 --> 00:52:26,102
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, man.

542
00:52:26,122 --> 00:52:29,083
[SPEAKER_23]: What the hell are we talking about before?

543
00:52:29,103 --> 00:52:31,725
[SPEAKER_23]: If I clap them together, it might make a thunderous noise, I don't know.

544
00:52:32,205 --> 00:52:32,486
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyway.

545
00:52:32,826 --> 00:52:35,027
[SPEAKER_23]: What the hell are we talking about before we get on this weird tangent?

546
00:52:35,067 --> 00:52:35,547
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know.

547
00:52:36,748 --> 00:52:37,609
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, American Idol.

548
00:52:37,649 --> 00:52:40,230
[SPEAKER_23]: I think I made Islander just throw up in his mouth a little bit, though.

549
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:41,531
[SPEAKER_23]: American Idol.

550
00:52:41,831 --> 00:52:47,215
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, since we were talking about American Idol, have you seen the previews for that show, You Think You Can Dance?

551
00:52:47,235 --> 00:52:47,295
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

552
00:52:48,684 --> 00:52:50,866
[SPEAKER_23]: No, is that the dance show on ABC?

553
00:52:51,046 --> 00:52:53,368
[SPEAKER_23]: That's the dance show that's going to be on Fox.

554
00:52:53,548 --> 00:52:55,309
[SPEAKER_23]: Fuckin' all these reality shows.

555
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:58,292
[SPEAKER_23]: It's going to be, imagine American Idol except dancing.

556
00:52:59,933 --> 00:53:00,874
[SPEAKER_23]: I should go on that show.

557
00:53:01,274 --> 00:53:02,595
[SPEAKER_23]: Including the people that can't dance.

558
00:53:02,815 --> 00:53:04,377
[SPEAKER_23]: No, you know what show actually I should go on?

559
00:53:04,757 --> 00:53:05,658
[SPEAKER_23]: Beauty and the Geek.

560
00:53:06,678 --> 00:53:07,319
[SPEAKER_23]: I saw that show.

561
00:53:07,339 --> 00:53:12,643
[SPEAKER_23]: You would think this show is a, no seriously, from the previews, I thought this show was going to be a big pile of trash.

562
00:53:13,324 --> 00:53:14,985
[SPEAKER_23]: It actually was a really cute show.

563
00:53:16,548 --> 00:53:16,948
[SPEAKER_23]: I thought.

564
00:53:17,009 --> 00:53:17,829
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know about you, Loki.

565
00:53:17,849 --> 00:53:19,250
[SPEAKER_23]: Which one again?

566
00:53:19,831 --> 00:53:21,792
[SPEAKER_23]: It's all these really nerdy guys.

567
00:53:21,812 --> 00:53:24,594
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, more nerdier than Bill Gates.

568
00:53:24,614 --> 00:53:26,135
[SPEAKER_23]: Like E3 goers.

569
00:53:26,215 --> 00:53:27,296
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, like E3 goers.

570
00:53:27,376 --> 00:53:28,357
[SPEAKER_23]: I haven't bathed in a few days.

571
00:53:28,377 --> 00:53:31,379
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, but you bathed.

572
00:53:32,219 --> 00:53:34,141
[SPEAKER_23]: They put them against Playboy models.

573
00:53:34,801 --> 00:53:58,048
[SPEAKER_23]: but the thing is that then they go in competitions and they pair off and they have to do competitions so the geeks have to teach the models like how to like spell and then the models have to teach the geeks like how to dance and how to do like social things so actually in the first episode they had a dance competition for the geeks and the models were in what a fifth grade spelling bee or what were they doing?

574
00:53:58,669 --> 00:54:02,510
[SPEAKER_23]: yeah that has to be hilarious it was so great because the one girl was like

575
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:03,591
[SPEAKER_23]: Tattoo.

576
00:54:03,851 --> 00:54:05,032
[SPEAKER_23]: T-A-T-O-O.

577
00:54:06,113 --> 00:54:07,734
[SPEAKER_23]: She got all excited because she won.

578
00:54:08,175 --> 00:54:09,236
[SPEAKER_23]: And then they're like, no.

579
00:54:09,316 --> 00:54:11,498
[SPEAKER_23]: They're like, no, it's not like that.

580
00:54:12,185 --> 00:54:19,007
[SPEAKER_23]: But it was really, like, the way they do it, they do it without it being demeaning, I think.

581
00:54:19,267 --> 00:54:22,567
[SPEAKER_23]: Like, it's poking fun without being malicious.

582
00:54:22,807 --> 00:54:27,108
[SPEAKER_23]: But a shot like that would be followed up immediately with the girl who actually wins it.

583
00:54:27,188 --> 00:54:33,390
[SPEAKER_23]: She's going, I feel so great right now because I've never won an intelligence competition in my entire life until today.

584
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:36,350
[SPEAKER_23]: And you're kind of like, that's so cute.

585
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:37,811
[SPEAKER_23]: That's so sad.

586
00:54:39,428 --> 00:54:40,309
[SPEAKER_23]: Congratulations!

587
00:54:40,349 --> 00:54:42,791
[SPEAKER_23]: You're at the fifth grade reading level there.

588
00:54:44,132 --> 00:54:44,632
[SPEAKER_22]: So, anyway.

589
00:54:46,133 --> 00:54:46,394
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

590
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,856
[SPEAKER_23]: But, yeah.

591
00:54:50,497 --> 00:54:50,817
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyways.

592
00:54:51,758 --> 00:54:52,459
[SPEAKER_23]: Sorry, yeah.

593
00:54:52,499 --> 00:54:54,020
[SPEAKER_23]: That was my reality show tangent.

594
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:56,101
[SPEAKER_23]: No, but seriously, Beauty and the Geek, it's actually really cute.

595
00:54:56,162 --> 00:54:56,602
[SPEAKER_23]: You should watch it.

596
00:54:56,662 --> 00:54:57,382
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyway, Loki.

597
00:54:57,543 --> 00:54:59,624
[SPEAKER_23]: Loki has some actual Bomani news for you kids.

598
00:55:00,045 --> 00:55:03,187
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, it's not Bomani news because... Is it one of Bomani?

599
00:55:04,528 --> 00:55:06,250
[SPEAKER_23]: One of Bomani, I guess.

600
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:08,972
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyways, let me see here.

601
00:55:10,049 --> 00:55:20,896
[SPEAKER_23]: Basically, I decided, you know, it's been a while since we heard something about those other games that are out there, so I figured I'd go take a peek and see what's actually being worked on.

602
00:55:21,056 --> 00:55:23,898
[SPEAKER_23]: So, Neon FM is where all the news is right now.

603
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:36,527
[SPEAKER_23]: Apparently, they've had a kind of an invitation-only, you know, debuting of their machine and stuff, which looks pretty cool, and considering it's all being done by scratch, it's pretty awesome.

604
00:55:36,647 --> 00:55:37,968
[SPEAKER_23]: And what they've got so far...

605
00:55:38,732 --> 00:55:57,099
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, basically you've got something that looks kind of similar to DDR, not really, um, it's, uh, basically you've got five panels on each side, arranged kind of like, um, a normal Beatmania controller, you know, back in the five key days, um, and- Without the turntable.

606
00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:01,101
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, yeah, obviously without the turntable, that'd be a little weird if it had- But that would be fun!

607
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:02,441
[SPEAKER_23]: Ice skating revolution!

608
00:56:03,161 --> 00:56:07,363
[SPEAKER_23]: Exactly, um, so basically, uh, we've got those, and, um,

609
00:56:08,917 --> 00:56:12,099
[SPEAKER_23]: It's basically, they were showing some of the screenshots and more of the gameplay.

610
00:56:12,139 --> 00:56:15,801
[SPEAKER_23]: And they, I guess, debuted this at Betson.

611
00:56:17,401 --> 00:56:20,623
[SPEAKER_23]: For those who don't know, Betson is an arcade parts supplier.

612
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:24,405
[SPEAKER_23]: And they're the ones actually building the machines for Neon FM.

613
00:56:25,286 --> 00:56:28,807
[SPEAKER_23]: And they actually debuted it, I guess, at one of their warehouses there.

614
00:56:29,108 --> 00:56:30,488
[SPEAKER_23]: So that was kind of interesting to see.

615
00:56:32,245 --> 00:56:34,026
[SPEAKER_23]: Some more interesting stuff that's happening right now.

616
00:56:34,306 --> 00:56:40,951
[SPEAKER_23]: I guess Thomas Howard, the same Thomas Howard that may be featured in La Seniorita and all that stuff.

617
00:56:41,691 --> 00:56:43,653
[SPEAKER_23]: He's actually going to... Captain T!

618
00:56:43,793 --> 00:56:44,513
[SPEAKER_23]: Captain T, yes.

619
00:56:44,854 --> 00:56:52,178
[SPEAKER_23]: He's actually going to Japan right now to film a live performance with the other artist that sings Girls Butts.

620
00:56:52,859 --> 00:56:55,561
[SPEAKER_23]: And they're doing the live video that's going to be in the background for that song.

621
00:56:56,401 --> 00:56:57,842
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, God.

622
00:56:58,042 --> 00:57:00,204
[SPEAKER_23]: Girls Butts is going to be the reason to play...

623
00:57:01,318 --> 00:57:03,099
[SPEAKER_23]: and honestly, what else?

624
00:57:03,619 --> 00:57:08,681
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, they've got, there's, what else?

625
00:57:08,821 --> 00:57:10,922
[SPEAKER_23]: Damn, where did my clip of girl's butts go?

626
00:57:10,942 --> 00:57:12,582
[SPEAKER_23]: I used to have it.

627
00:57:12,602 --> 00:57:13,342
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, don't worry about it.

628
00:57:13,482 --> 00:57:15,983
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll be able to get you some clips in a little bit.

629
00:57:16,043 --> 00:57:17,304
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm going to download this other thing.

630
00:57:17,384 --> 00:57:17,784
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, fine.

631
00:57:18,194 --> 00:57:21,295
[SPEAKER_23]: It's basically 20-second samples of a bunch of different songs.

632
00:57:21,755 --> 00:57:33,099
[SPEAKER_23]: But we actually have some of the full-length songs, not obviously the same cut that's going to be in the game, but from Poppin' Co., which is one of the artists that does the music in the game.

633
00:57:33,579 --> 00:57:36,980
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's some pretty interesting generic stuff right now.

634
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,840
[SPEAKER_23]: Are we going to play clips from these songs here?

635
00:57:39,281 --> 00:57:40,801
[SPEAKER_23]: I suppose we should just play clips, yeah.

636
00:57:40,821 --> 00:57:42,282
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's just play clips, because these are kind of long.

637
00:57:42,302 --> 00:57:43,542
[SPEAKER_23]: So here's a clip of...

638
00:57:44,182 --> 00:57:45,765
[SPEAKER_23]: Are all these songs in the game?

639
00:57:45,785 --> 00:57:47,808
[SPEAKER_23]: Because there's two songs here called Complete Shot.

640
00:57:48,409 --> 00:57:52,716
[SPEAKER_23]: Complete Shot, I think the Greek Fire mix is not in the game, but the other one is.

641
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:57,323
[SPEAKER_23]: Then let's play a clip here of the Club Blend mix of Complete Shot.

642
00:57:57,363 --> 00:57:57,664
[SPEAKER_23]: Here it is.

643
00:57:58,024 --> 00:57:59,066
[SPEAKER_23]: This is going to be a Neon FM.

644
00:58:16,074 --> 00:58:18,336
[SPEAKER_23]: Is this like their version of Max 300, or what is this?

645
00:58:18,717 --> 00:58:22,000
[SPEAKER_23]: No, I think it's probably just, it's more stuff to it.

646
00:58:22,521 --> 00:58:24,082
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, it's because it's a long version of the song.

647
00:58:24,102 --> 00:58:24,943
[SPEAKER_22]: Death Metal!

648
00:58:26,304 --> 00:58:27,706
[SPEAKER_22]: Worship Satan!

649
00:58:31,109 --> 00:58:34,372
[SPEAKER_22]: No, it's just like, you know, a techno song.

650
00:58:51,721 --> 00:58:53,645
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, that might be a Max 300 song.

651
00:58:53,705 --> 00:58:54,446
[SPEAKER_23]: Not too shabby.

652
00:58:54,646 --> 00:58:55,287
[SPEAKER_22]: Not too shabby.

653
00:58:55,688 --> 00:58:56,730
[SPEAKER_23]: Better sound than in the groove.

654
00:58:57,351 --> 00:58:59,695
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, they're different.

655
00:58:59,735 --> 00:59:00,036
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know.

656
00:59:00,096 --> 00:59:00,597
[SPEAKER_23]: It's hard to say.

657
00:59:00,717 --> 00:59:01,919
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, here's a clip of the other song.

658
00:59:01,939 --> 00:59:03,021
[SPEAKER_23]: This is Electro 8.

659
00:59:03,742 --> 00:59:03,963
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

660
00:59:04,223 --> 00:59:04,764
[SPEAKER_23]: Enjoy this one.

661
00:59:40,816 --> 00:59:42,117
[SPEAKER_23]: Thanks for watching!

662
00:59:57,083 --> 01:00:22,667
[SPEAKER_23]: May 13th prototype party where they had it at Betzen and you can actually see pictures of the cabinet and actually if you go to NeonFM.com you can check out they have more screenshots or actual shots of the cabinet that you can see the actual buttons and stuff and it looks pretty cool actually so far and they've done a pretty good job with the game I believe I wish they'd just call it Feet Mania because that would be funny because it looks really cool from what they've got so far I mean

663
01:00:23,499 --> 01:00:25,561
[SPEAKER_10]: That just makes me think of Stepping Selection.

664
01:00:26,821 --> 01:00:32,465
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have bad, bad traumatized memories of Stepping Selection.

665
01:00:32,586 --> 01:00:33,046
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

666
01:00:33,706 --> 01:00:34,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Boo Jaleco.

667
01:00:35,628 --> 01:00:38,370
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm actually excited about Neon FM.

668
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:40,691
[SPEAKER_23]: I think they're doing a lot of things right.

669
01:00:41,152 --> 01:00:46,756
[SPEAKER_23]: And sadly, I think the reason why they're doing a lot of things right is because they've been able to learn from everything in the groove did wrong.

670
01:00:47,076 --> 01:00:51,319
[SPEAKER_23]: And here's the other thing, too, which is going to be before everyone starts going, well, they're going to get sued!

671
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:55,601
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, they're actually working with Konami of America throughout the entire process of developing this game.

672
01:00:55,681 --> 01:00:59,003
[SPEAKER_23]: That's what I think is, like, really kind of weird, in a way.

673
01:00:59,043 --> 01:01:02,725
[SPEAKER_23]: Not really, because it's not bad, it's just weird.

674
01:01:02,985 --> 01:01:17,653
[SPEAKER_23]: It makes sense, because they're getting feedback from them, what they think, and also they're making sure that all their bases are covered, like, you know, hey, is there anything we're infringing on that we need to be copyright, you know, paying you for licensing and stuff, and they're taking care of all that.

675
01:01:17,673 --> 01:01:20,475
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, you should be giving us 50 million dollars.

676
01:01:21,295 --> 01:01:30,920
[SPEAKER_23]: But, honestly, I don't think this is going to be much of a problem compared to, like, say, you know, in the groove, which looked exactly like DDR, this is at least, doesn't resemble DDR.

677
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:38,183
[SPEAKER_23]: New cabinet, new dance pad, they've kind of, even in the screens, it doesn't look anything like DDR because of the way they've rearranged things, so.

678
01:01:38,203 --> 01:01:39,664
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, it's very different.

679
01:01:40,202 --> 01:01:42,483
[SPEAKER_23]: That's why I give the game a lot of credit.

680
01:01:43,343 --> 01:01:47,305
[SPEAKER_23]: I hope it catches on enough so that we see this in a sizable number of arcades.

681
01:01:47,325 --> 01:01:52,647
[SPEAKER_23]: Honestly, I'm glad to see something that's different than, say, DDR Pump It Up.

682
01:01:52,687 --> 01:01:54,467
[SPEAKER_23]: Something that'll be a little different.

683
01:01:55,368 --> 01:01:58,869
[SPEAKER_23]: Also, good comment from our chatroom.

684
01:01:59,289 --> 01:02:03,531
[SPEAKER_23]: Ron Chan says, maybe the FM in Neon FM stands for Feet Mania.

685
01:02:03,551 --> 01:02:05,311
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that.

686
01:02:05,452 --> 01:02:06,532
[SPEAKER_23]: So Neon Feet Mania.

687
01:02:07,079 --> 01:02:07,899
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a genius.

688
01:02:08,139 --> 01:02:10,720
[SPEAKER_23]: And here's another thing also, in case you're interested.

689
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:16,862
[SPEAKER_23]: There's a link on Neon FM's site here where you can actually download ringtones for your cell phone.

690
01:02:17,283 --> 01:02:18,583
[SPEAKER_23]: One of them being Girls Butts.

691
01:02:18,863 --> 01:02:19,223
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes!

692
01:02:19,663 --> 01:02:20,064
[SPEAKER_23]: Fun.

693
01:02:21,244 --> 01:02:24,385
[SPEAKER_23]: Dude, I'm so downloading that for my... Does it support Sprint, or do we know?

694
01:02:24,825 --> 01:02:28,627
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, they have a picture here that shows M-Mode, so... I don't know.

695
01:02:28,727 --> 01:02:31,568
[SPEAKER_23]: M-Mode would be, I believe, the AT&T... That's not Sprint.

696
01:02:31,888 --> 01:02:32,268
[SPEAKER_23]: Sprint is...

697
01:02:32,828 --> 01:02:35,110
[SPEAKER_23]: But it's just, they're MIDI files, I mean, come on.

698
01:02:35,170 --> 01:02:36,571
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, any phone should be able to download that.

699
01:02:36,651 --> 01:02:37,131
[SPEAKER_23]: That's awesome.

700
01:02:38,732 --> 01:02:41,234
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's your... I can't find my clip of Girls Butts.

701
01:02:41,834 --> 01:02:46,657
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm downloading, I have a thing downloading right now, which I will actually give to you if you give me my flash drive back.

702
01:02:46,677 --> 01:02:47,137
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, I will.

703
01:02:47,718 --> 01:02:55,823
[SPEAKER_23]: That's a 20 second clip of about 13 to 20 different songs, and you'll be able to hear a lot more of what's going to be in there right now.

704
01:02:55,903 --> 01:02:59,185
[SPEAKER_23]: So I guess I'll throw it on here, and we'll play it later.

705
01:02:59,445 --> 01:03:00,326
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, we can do that.

706
01:03:02,489 --> 01:03:03,010
[SPEAKER_23]: Sounds good.

707
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:04,311
[SPEAKER_23]: So we'll play that later.

708
01:03:04,351 --> 01:03:05,111
[SPEAKER_23]: More Neon FM.

709
01:03:05,752 --> 01:03:06,953
[SPEAKER_23]: Any idea when they're going to release this?

710
01:03:07,654 --> 01:03:09,295
[SPEAKER_23]: Any word of a release date yet?

711
01:03:09,476 --> 01:03:09,796
[SPEAKER_23]: Not yet.

712
01:03:10,416 --> 01:03:15,401
[SPEAKER_23]: We need to talk to somebody over on the team over there and try to get somebody on this show to give us details.

713
01:03:16,182 --> 01:03:16,342
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

714
01:03:19,164 --> 01:03:21,346
[SPEAKER_23]: and I also want girl's butts dedicated to me.

715
01:03:21,806 --> 01:03:25,528
[SPEAKER_23]: I was going to say some other stuff non-related.

716
01:03:26,549 --> 01:03:32,053
[SPEAKER_23]: I have a Myspace site, another one now, that I've been plugging in our LiveJournal community.

717
01:03:33,974 --> 01:03:38,397
[SPEAKER_23]: Actually, it's Myspace.com slash LokiFusion.

718
01:03:38,457 --> 01:03:45,002
[SPEAKER_23]: You can actually listen to brand new songs on there as they come out and I don't upload them to my really shitty site.

719
01:03:45,322 --> 01:03:50,355
[SPEAKER_23]: And plus I have a really cool logo that looks just like the DDR Ultramix 3 logo.

720
01:03:51,919 --> 01:03:52,520
[SPEAKER_23]: It's spiffy.

721
01:03:55,064 --> 01:03:58,145
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, so go check it out, befriend me, do all that wonderful stuff.

722
01:03:58,385 --> 01:04:08,668
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, also, if you play Step Mania, um, someone actually made a sim file for, um, what was it, uh, The Legend of Trance 2005, so go check that out, Bomani style.

723
01:04:08,988 --> 01:04:11,289
[SPEAKER_23]: That's a few pages back in their sim file section there.

724
01:04:12,209 --> 01:04:15,730
[SPEAKER_23]: And... Which technically would count as another max sim file.

725
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:16,670
[SPEAKER_23]: Good job, guys.

726
01:04:17,390 --> 01:04:19,471
[SPEAKER_23]: Bastards.

727
01:04:19,731 --> 01:04:22,992
[SPEAKER_23]: The background art, though, kind of sucks, but, you know.

728
01:04:24,412 --> 01:04:24,733
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyways.

729
01:04:25,073 --> 01:04:28,495
[SPEAKER_22]: And then, other than that, really, not too much else going on.

730
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:31,216
[SPEAKER_22]: I think I found it.

731
01:04:31,476 --> 01:04:31,996
[SPEAKER_22]: I think I found it.

732
01:04:32,097 --> 01:04:32,537
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, God.

733
01:04:32,857 --> 01:04:33,937
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob found girl's butts.

734
01:04:34,318 --> 01:04:35,098
[SPEAKER_22]: On his computer.

735
01:04:35,919 --> 01:04:36,659
[SPEAKER_22]: This is it, right?

736
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:38,920
[SPEAKER_22]: I have no idea.

737
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:39,781
[SPEAKER_22]: I think this is it.

738
01:04:40,361 --> 01:04:40,641
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes!

739
01:04:43,262 --> 01:04:45,184
[SPEAKER_17]: Wanna know what I did today?

740
01:04:45,324 --> 01:04:46,944
[SPEAKER_17]: I was looking at girl's butts.

741
01:04:47,845 --> 01:04:49,986
[SPEAKER_17]: Hanging out in the subway.

742
01:04:50,106 --> 01:04:51,427
[SPEAKER_17]: Looking at girl's butts.

743
01:04:52,566 --> 01:04:55,068
[SPEAKER_17]: This is right here the song of the game.

744
01:04:55,088 --> 01:04:55,068
... ...

745
01:05:24,178 --> 01:05:30,783
[SPEAKER_23]: Now how can you not be excited about Neon Feet Mania after hearing that?

746
01:05:31,204 --> 01:05:35,547
[SPEAKER_23]: Now that's not the same mix though, because that doesn't sound like Thomas Howard.

747
01:05:35,627 --> 01:05:37,289
[SPEAKER_23]: That sounds like DJ Potato singing that.

748
01:05:38,577 --> 01:05:39,157
[SPEAKER_23]: Am I wrong?

749
01:05:39,297 --> 01:05:39,997
[SPEAKER_23]: I have no idea.

750
01:05:40,057 --> 01:05:41,878
[SPEAKER_23]: I think that's DJ Potato actually singing that.

751
01:05:42,238 --> 01:05:43,638
[SPEAKER_23]: It might be DJ Potato singing.

752
01:05:43,958 --> 01:05:47,539
[SPEAKER_23]: But the new one, I mean, I've got to say that they're doing quite a bit.

753
01:05:47,619 --> 01:05:51,539
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, they're putting quite a lot of polish in this game.

754
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:55,200
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, getting a live performance of Thomas Howard in Japan with the other artists.

755
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:59,001
[SPEAKER_23]: And apparently there's a female artist that does vocals on that song as well.

756
01:05:59,781 --> 01:06:05,562
[SPEAKER_23]: I want, like, really, like, 80s porn, like, close-up shots of her butt in, like, tight clothing and stuff.

757
01:06:06,798 --> 01:06:07,918
[SPEAKER_10]: It has to be porn style.

758
01:06:09,099 --> 01:06:10,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Even DarkSakura agrees with me.

759
01:06:11,259 --> 01:06:11,900
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh my god.

760
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:13,440
[SPEAKER_10]: Picture this.

761
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:14,760
[SPEAKER_10]: He's got to be all pimped out.

762
01:06:14,861 --> 01:06:17,601
[SPEAKER_23]: This one yells at me every time.

763
01:06:17,621 --> 01:06:23,523
[SPEAKER_23]: I even mention they should objectify women in one form or another, and she agrees with me on this one.

764
01:06:24,784 --> 01:06:27,925
[SPEAKER_10]: This song has to have it, and the guy has to be all pimped out.

765
01:06:28,205 --> 01:06:29,705
[SPEAKER_10]: Then the girl has to turn around and shoot him.

766
01:06:30,065 --> 01:06:32,606
[SPEAKER_23]: I've got your video right here.

767
01:06:32,646 --> 01:06:35,987
[SPEAKER_23]: You need to have a really quick close-up shot of a door opening.

768
01:06:36,351 --> 01:06:39,633
[SPEAKER_23]: and Thomas Howard singing the song is the pizza guy.

769
01:06:43,036 --> 01:06:44,277
[SPEAKER_22]: That would be fucking awesome.

770
01:06:44,357 --> 01:06:46,018
[SPEAKER_22]: I still think the girl needs to go around and shoot.

771
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:50,862
[SPEAKER_23]: They should parody a bunch of different porno videos.

772
01:06:50,882 --> 01:06:51,922
[SPEAKER_10]: The pimp should be a girl.

773
01:06:52,823 --> 01:06:54,744
[SPEAKER_23]: Just when I thought it was going to be a train wreck of a show.

774
01:06:55,785 --> 01:06:56,706
[SPEAKER_23]: I found girl's butts.

775
01:06:56,986 --> 01:06:57,646
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm going to be happy.

776
01:06:59,491 --> 01:07:01,893
[SPEAKER_23]: We're going to have the Skype line open very soon.

777
01:07:02,113 --> 01:07:09,140
[SPEAKER_23]: www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on... Interact with us for more information on the Skype line.

778
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:16,066
[SPEAKER_23]: I almost said click on girl's butts, but I... We don't have that on Orange Lounge.

779
01:07:17,247 --> 01:07:19,089
[SPEAKER_23]: We need a girl's butts button.

780
01:07:21,031 --> 01:07:23,513
[SPEAKER_23]: That should be the marketing for the game.

781
01:07:23,593 --> 01:07:25,715
[SPEAKER_23]: They should have that printed on bumper stickers.

782
01:07:27,950 --> 01:07:31,092
[SPEAKER_23]: It should just be Neon FM and really tiny print in the corner.

783
01:07:31,132 --> 01:07:36,695
[SPEAKER_23]: Neon FM featuring Girls Butts with a Z. That song.

784
01:07:37,135 --> 01:07:37,515
[SPEAKER_23]: Awesome.

785
01:07:37,616 --> 01:07:39,156
[SPEAKER_23]: That song needs to go on the radio.

786
01:07:40,817 --> 01:07:43,499
[SPEAKER_23]: Maybe we should help them out.

787
01:07:43,899 --> 01:07:45,660
[SPEAKER_23]: We've got some artistic people on staff here.

788
01:07:45,961 --> 01:07:47,922
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's make some Neon FM promo banners.

789
01:07:48,922 --> 01:07:49,483
[SPEAKER_23]: And we'll do that.

790
01:07:49,503 --> 01:07:52,404
[SPEAKER_23]: A little Neon FM featuring Girls Butts.

791
01:07:52,445 --> 01:07:53,485
[SPEAKER_23]: Really huge.

792
01:07:54,106 --> 01:07:55,426
[SPEAKER_23]: And then have the 80s porn butt.

793
01:07:55,807 --> 01:07:56,467
[SPEAKER_23]: I think we should do that.

794
01:07:57,322 --> 01:08:01,267
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll do it as a favor to Neon FM, and then maybe some of them will come on the show and talk about their game.

795
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:03,891
[SPEAKER_23]: I like this idea.

796
01:08:04,612 --> 01:08:05,313
[SPEAKER_10]: It has merit.

797
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:10,519
[SPEAKER_23]: I think we'll go to a quick break.

798
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:13,844
[SPEAKER_23]: When we come back, we are going to take your calls over on the Skype line.

799
01:08:14,955 --> 01:08:16,676
[SPEAKER_23]: www.orangeloungeradio.com

800
01:08:38,186 --> 01:08:39,147
[SPEAKER_23]: That might not be a bad idea.

801
01:08:39,268 --> 01:08:47,941
[SPEAKER_23]: I have a feeling that if we do that, we will be taking an inside joke or a joke that was five minutes ago and just be ramming it into the ground.

802
01:08:48,762 --> 01:08:49,323
[SPEAKER_22]: That's okay.

803
01:08:49,443 --> 01:08:49,663
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

804
01:08:49,924 --> 01:08:50,244
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll see.

805
01:08:51,469 --> 01:08:59,114
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, in this break, I thought maybe what we could do is actually play some In The Groove music this break, because we've kind of been mean to them this week.

806
01:08:59,134 --> 01:08:59,975
[SPEAKER_23]: Has In The Groove come out yet?

807
01:09:00,055 --> 01:09:14,584
[SPEAKER_23]: Because apparently, and this is interesting, apparently, someone I know at work, they're like, you know, I'm looking for a DDR game that has some Britney Spears songs in it, because my daughter, daughter's a 10-year-old, okay, now she's into the Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera crap,

808
01:09:15,214 --> 01:09:17,376
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, they're looking for a song that had some of that stuff.

809
01:09:17,416 --> 01:09:19,557
[SPEAKER_23]: So I'm loaning her DDR Extreme Max 2.

810
01:09:19,817 --> 01:09:21,659
[SPEAKER_23]: In return, she's loaning me In The Groove.

811
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:23,180
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

812
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:24,100
[SPEAKER_23]: For the home console.

813
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:25,381
[SPEAKER_23]: Apparently she already has it.

814
01:09:25,441 --> 01:09:26,482
[SPEAKER_23]: She says that's what it is.

815
01:09:27,162 --> 01:09:33,947
[SPEAKER_23]: She says it looks exactly like DDR, except it does, you know, I showed her pictures of In The Groove and she's like, I'm almost positive that's what it is.

816
01:09:35,214 --> 01:09:43,866
[SPEAKER_23]: If it is, that's very odd, because I haven't heard of it coming out yet, and it would be all over if it had come out.

817
01:09:44,307 --> 01:09:44,667
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll see.

818
01:09:44,868 --> 01:09:45,849
[SPEAKER_23]: Let me check, let me check.

819
01:09:45,889 --> 01:09:48,333
[SPEAKER_23]: In fact, let me just make sure I haven't missed something, okay?

820
01:09:48,553 --> 01:09:52,198
[SPEAKER_23]: ITGFreak.com, because this site would have it, right?

821
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:54,002
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's see.

822
01:09:54,942 --> 01:09:55,102
[SPEAKER_23]: Nope.

823
01:09:55,643 --> 01:09:57,183
[SPEAKER_23]: No news on the home version coming out.

824
01:09:57,643 --> 01:10:02,664
[SPEAKER_23]: Your co-worker's insane or has gotten some huge break somehow.

825
01:10:03,104 --> 01:10:04,264
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know what she has.

826
01:10:04,364 --> 01:10:07,305
[SPEAKER_23]: I bet you anything it's MC Groove's dance craze.

827
01:10:07,605 --> 01:10:08,505
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh my god.

828
01:10:08,985 --> 01:10:10,645
[SPEAKER_23]: That's probably what you're going to get in return.

829
01:10:11,685 --> 01:10:15,166
[SPEAKER_23]: Either way, we'll have a review of whatever the hell it is that she has.

830
01:10:17,446 --> 01:10:18,907
[SPEAKER_23]: Some subpar game.

831
01:10:20,447 --> 01:10:20,707
[SPEAKER_23]: What am I...

832
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:25,370
[SPEAKER_23]: What am I looking for in this room?

833
01:10:25,390 --> 01:10:28,533
[SPEAKER_10]: The girl's butt thing just totally inspired me to open a restaurant.

834
01:10:29,193 --> 01:10:29,673
[SPEAKER_23]: Called what?

835
01:10:30,394 --> 01:10:34,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, this objectifying women thing is pretty stupid.

836
01:10:34,477 --> 01:10:35,958
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that men should be objectified.

837
01:10:36,359 --> 01:10:37,840
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm opening a restaurant called Heckers.

838
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,101
[SPEAKER_23]: Hey, there's no problem with that.

839
01:10:40,282 --> 01:10:41,022
[SPEAKER_23]: Or Bananas.

840
01:10:41,623 --> 01:10:42,964
[SPEAKER_23]: It was in a commercial a while ago, I think.

841
01:10:43,124 --> 01:10:45,385
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's a chicken restaurant like Hooters, so it's going to be Heckers.

842
01:10:47,147 --> 01:10:47,527
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.

843
01:10:48,208 --> 01:10:51,070
[SPEAKER_23]: I thought about a cool pool hall called Great Wreck.

844
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:53,321
[SPEAKER_23]: No, Jailbait

845
01:11:24,252 --> 01:11:24,552
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.

846
01:11:24,993 --> 01:11:25,293
[SPEAKER_23]: Whatever.

847
01:11:25,773 --> 01:11:26,974
[SPEAKER_23]: I think we're going to go to that break now.

848
01:11:27,455 --> 01:11:27,675
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

849
01:11:27,875 --> 01:11:28,135
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.

850
01:11:28,976 --> 01:11:32,239
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

851
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,061
[SPEAKER_23]: And we're going to start this break off.

852
01:11:35,361 --> 01:11:36,542
[SPEAKER_23]: I said we'd do some in the groove music.

853
01:11:36,562 --> 01:11:41,766
[SPEAKER_23]: We're going to start it off with a little trancy song called Walking on Fire because we haven't played this one yet on the show and it's kind of neat.

854
01:11:42,207 --> 01:11:44,769
[SPEAKER_23]: So enjoy this and we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio.

855
01:12:08,303 --> 01:12:32,045
[SPEAKER_13]: The whisper in the breakdown Is the part of everything behind me Unexplained nature of the heaven Crushing every feeling that sends me

856
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:56,634
[SPEAKER_13]: Touch me, I wanna know if you know that I need you And you need me too Ah yeah, ah yeah

857
01:17:09,216 --> 01:17:10,759
I want you to touch me Hold me

858
01:17:44,225 --> 01:17:59,338
[SPEAKER_13]: I want you to touch me I want you to touch me I am a robot, a fucking robot Walking on the spaceship every night and day

859
01:18:13,946 --> 01:18:15,187
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm Romeo, I'm Juliet

860
01:18:40,979 --> 01:18:41,701
Thank you for watching!

861
01:19:13,576 --> 01:19:18,241
The first time that I walked in my life, I felt a strange attraction.

862
01:19:18,281 --> 01:19:18,922
Felt a strange

863
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:48,621
Gaming Radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

864
01:19:48,722 --> 01:19:49,462
Orange Lounge Radio.

865
01:20:14,158 --> 01:20:16,800
[SPEAKER_23]: We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

866
01:20:17,801 --> 01:20:20,143
[SPEAKER_23]: Some music there from Integroove.

867
01:20:22,025 --> 01:20:23,967
[SPEAKER_23]: Coming to a console near you eventually.

868
01:20:25,248 --> 01:20:26,369
[SPEAKER_23]: Romeo and Juliet.

869
01:20:27,049 --> 01:20:28,070
[SPEAKER_23]: Before that, Touch Me.

870
01:20:28,831 --> 01:20:29,511
[SPEAKER_23]: Bubble Dancer!

871
01:20:30,272 --> 01:20:31,854
[SPEAKER_23]: Walking on fire starting that set off.

872
01:20:32,454 --> 01:20:34,496
[SPEAKER_23]: A little diverse stuff in there.

873
01:20:35,417 --> 01:20:40,301
[SPEAKER_23]: I like Bubble Dancer because it sounds like Aqua, but like a real cheap Aqua knockoff.

874
01:20:41,434 --> 01:20:47,226
[SPEAKER_23]: Which makes it even worse, but at the same time, the only reason you liked Aqua is because it was one of those, it's so bad, it's good.

875
01:20:47,788 --> 01:20:49,692
[SPEAKER_23]: So when it gets badder, it gets gooder.

876
01:20:51,977 --> 01:20:52,357
[SPEAKER_23]: Nevermind.

877
01:20:53,479 --> 01:20:58,684
[SPEAKER_23]: We're going to take your calls right now on the Skype line, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

878
01:20:58,724 --> 01:21:02,248
[SPEAKER_23]: Click on Interact With Us and you can call into the show.

879
01:21:02,308 --> 01:21:09,035
[SPEAKER_23]: Although I don't know if we have a lot of people that want to talk to us tonight because we don't have a lot of folks that are actually logged into Skype right now.

880
01:21:09,155 --> 01:21:10,997
[SPEAKER_23]: So we'll see what happens.

881
01:21:11,897 --> 01:21:12,498
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know what's going on.

882
01:21:39,437 --> 01:21:42,198
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, on Fridays over at DDR Freak, if you want.

883
01:21:43,238 --> 01:21:45,619
[SPEAKER_23]: And you know, if no one calls us, we have to get into Paris Hilton chat.

884
01:21:45,919 --> 01:21:46,940
[SPEAKER_23]: And I don't think you want that tonight.

885
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:47,420
[SPEAKER_23]: No, I'm kidding.

886
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:50,461
[SPEAKER_23]: Even I'm sick of Paris Hilton chat.

887
01:21:50,781 --> 01:21:52,081
[SPEAKER_23]: Nicole Ritchie chat, though.

888
01:21:52,702 --> 01:21:53,942
[SPEAKER_23]: I've got a whole lot I could say about that.

889
01:21:54,002 --> 01:21:54,642
[SPEAKER_10]: She sucks.

890
01:21:55,883 --> 01:21:57,503
[SPEAKER_23]: She's Paris Hilton's partner.

891
01:21:57,583 --> 01:21:59,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, we're getting... Oh, on that stupid show.

892
01:21:59,964 --> 01:22:00,184
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

893
01:22:00,284 --> 01:22:01,945
[SPEAKER_10]: I watched the sausage episode.

894
01:22:02,025 --> 01:22:02,565
[SPEAKER_10]: Not anymore.

895
01:22:02,645 --> 01:22:03,485
[SPEAKER_23]: Saved by the call.

896
01:22:03,806 --> 01:22:04,946
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

897
01:22:05,766 --> 01:22:06,206
[SPEAKER_23]: Hey, Scott.

898
01:22:06,226 --> 01:22:06,647
[SPEAKER_23]: Siggy here.

899
01:22:06,707 --> 01:22:07,307
[SPEAKER_23]: Hello, Siggy.

900
01:22:07,327 --> 01:22:07,667
[SPEAKER_23]: How are you?

901
01:22:09,127 --> 01:22:09,947
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing fine.

902
01:22:10,728 --> 01:22:11,749
[SPEAKER_23]: What's on your mind, sir?

903
01:22:13,051 --> 01:22:17,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, last Friday I was able to attend the World Series of Poker.

904
01:22:18,216 --> 01:22:22,740
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, yes, I remember you talking about that on last week's show, and you were going to win us millions of dollars, right?

905
01:22:23,842 --> 01:22:26,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, I lost on the second level.

906
01:22:26,264 --> 01:22:26,645
[SPEAKER_23]: Damn it!

907
01:22:27,352 --> 01:22:28,513
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, at least you got to the second level.

908
01:22:28,553 --> 01:22:33,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is going to be one of my FUs of the week tonight.

909
01:22:34,117 --> 01:22:35,538
[SPEAKER_23]: How bad did you lose?

910
01:22:36,038 --> 01:22:42,562
[SPEAKER_23]: How exactly, I mean, I don't know how tournament poker works, but I guess, how many people do you play against at a time in tournament poker?

911
01:22:43,443 --> 01:22:49,147
[SPEAKER_03]: There were 240 tables, and there were nine players, and I just multiplied it by nine.

912
01:22:49,567 --> 01:22:50,508
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh my gosh.

913
01:22:52,279 --> 01:22:57,163
[SPEAKER_23]: You won out of nine people in the first round, right?

914
01:22:57,883 --> 01:22:58,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah.

915
01:22:58,804 --> 01:23:00,805
[SPEAKER_03]: I already won over two tables.

916
01:23:01,245 --> 01:23:01,606
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, eh.

917
01:23:02,506 --> 01:23:03,067
[SPEAKER_23]: That's not bad.

918
01:23:03,747 --> 01:23:06,149
[SPEAKER_03]: But unfortunately, I lost to a professional poker player.

919
01:23:06,749 --> 01:23:08,650
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, well, that always kind of sucks.

920
01:23:09,571 --> 01:23:11,652
[SPEAKER_23]: So you got up there a little bit then.

921
01:23:11,732 --> 01:23:12,613
[SPEAKER_23]: That's still pretty cool.

922
01:23:13,193 --> 01:23:13,714
[SPEAKER_23]: Good job.

923
01:23:14,414 --> 01:23:14,935
[SPEAKER_23]: Maybe next year.

924
01:23:14,955 --> 01:23:15,615
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, maybe next year.

925
01:23:15,635 --> 01:23:16,676
[SPEAKER_03]: There goes my $1,000 buy-in.

926
01:23:20,622 --> 01:23:22,923
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh my god, it was $1,000 to buy in?

927
01:23:23,543 --> 01:23:24,423
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

928
01:23:25,063 --> 01:23:26,584
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh my god, you didn't get any of it back.

929
01:23:27,744 --> 01:23:28,304
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, no.

930
01:23:29,225 --> 01:23:28,304
$1,000?

931
01:23:29,345 --> 01:23:32,806
[SPEAKER_03]: For a freaking poker?

932
01:23:32,886 --> 01:23:34,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing, here's the thing.

933
01:23:34,426 --> 01:23:35,687
[SPEAKER_03]: The top prize is $725,000.

934
01:23:35,727 --> 01:23:36,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

935
01:23:36,587 --> 01:23:47,110
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's going to be another No Limit tournament this Friday, which is going to be a $2,000 buy-in, and it's going to be twice.

936
01:23:47,870 --> 01:23:49,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Twice than that for the top prize.

937
01:23:49,571 --> 01:23:49,831
[SPEAKER_23]: Wow.

938
01:23:50,782 --> 01:23:51,522
[SPEAKER_23]: That's pretty hardcore.

939
01:23:51,542 --> 01:23:54,424
[SPEAKER_23]: Can you imagine a DDR tournament with $1,000 buy-ins?

940
01:23:56,625 --> 01:23:59,066
[SPEAKER_23]: At least you could have a DDR tournament that has more than that one.

941
01:23:59,326 --> 01:24:03,088
[SPEAKER_10]: That's like just under half of my monthly salary.

942
01:24:04,949 --> 01:24:05,769
[SPEAKER_23]: That's crazy.

943
01:24:06,449 --> 01:24:07,330
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, what do you expect?

944
01:24:07,370 --> 01:24:08,070
[SPEAKER_23]: It's Vegas, right?

945
01:24:08,850 --> 01:24:09,190
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

946
01:24:10,111 --> 01:24:10,411
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.

947
01:24:10,651 --> 01:24:13,853
[SPEAKER_23]: What do you have to say to the people that are criticizing you for putting up $1,000 of your money?

948
01:24:16,192 --> 01:24:20,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's just, you know, I've already planned this for months now.

949
01:24:20,874 --> 01:24:23,315
[SPEAKER_23]: Everybody has their thing, right?

950
01:24:25,276 --> 01:24:27,037
[SPEAKER_23]: You're allowed to spend money on poker.

951
01:24:27,297 --> 01:24:34,300
[SPEAKER_23]: Some people invest their money in their video game collections or their anime collections, so you have the right to spend your money on a poker tournament if you want, right?

952
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:37,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm doing it just for the fun of it.

953
01:24:37,401 --> 01:24:40,743
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to experience what poker players do.

954
01:24:40,763 --> 01:24:41,563
[SPEAKER_23]: There you go.

955
01:24:41,583 --> 01:24:45,205
[SPEAKER_23]: What's a really good poker game for the... I'm sorry, finish your thought?

956
01:24:47,038 --> 01:24:48,019
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you finish it up.

957
01:24:48,079 --> 01:24:49,801
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

958
01:24:49,921 --> 01:24:54,084
[SPEAKER_23]: What's a really good poker game for, like, home, consoles, video games?

959
01:24:54,104 --> 01:24:55,525
[SPEAKER_23]: Because there's a whole lot of them out there.

960
01:24:55,885 --> 01:24:57,206
[SPEAKER_23]: What do you think is a really good poker game?

961
01:24:58,147 --> 01:25:05,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I say you should start with, you know, like, a low-limit Hold'em or, you know, low-limit Omaha.

962
01:25:06,234 --> 01:25:07,615
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's more complicated.

963
01:25:07,755 --> 01:25:09,717
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm talking about, like, a video game out there.

964
01:25:09,737 --> 01:25:12,179
[SPEAKER_23]: Because the E3, it looked like there were a lot of poker video games.

965
01:25:12,739 --> 01:25:15,761
[SPEAKER_03]: The World Poker Championship for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

966
01:25:16,082 --> 01:25:16,302
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, cool.

967
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:18,801
[SPEAKER_23]: I hear that one's really good.

968
01:25:19,121 --> 01:25:23,785
[SPEAKER_23]: What's the one that, does anybody remember there was one that Iguana Girl beat some guy at?

969
01:25:23,825 --> 01:25:25,286
[SPEAKER_23]: What was the game they were playing?

970
01:25:25,326 --> 01:25:26,287
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't remember his name.

971
01:25:26,307 --> 01:25:27,307
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me ask her real quick.

972
01:25:27,487 --> 01:25:28,288
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, sounds good.

973
01:25:28,688 --> 01:25:29,269
[SPEAKER_10]: Chatting with her right now.

974
01:25:29,369 --> 01:25:30,550
[SPEAKER_23]: You know what it comes down to?

975
01:25:30,890 --> 01:25:32,411
[SPEAKER_23]: You need to play more strip poker games.

976
01:25:32,531 --> 01:25:32,751
[SPEAKER_23]: Why?

977
01:25:32,771 --> 01:25:35,493
[SPEAKER_23]: Because they make you fucking work to get those women naked.

978
01:25:35,954 --> 01:25:38,896
[SPEAKER_23]: And goddammit, it's not like any ordinary strip poker game, you know,

979
01:25:39,411 --> 01:25:40,752
[SPEAKER_23]: Phil Hellmuth, Howard Lederer, Greg Raymer

980
01:26:09,710 --> 01:26:31,141
[SPEAKER_03]: ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

981
01:26:38,846 --> 01:26:39,888
[SPEAKER_03]: I was tired.

982
01:26:40,790 --> 01:26:46,423
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, before I headed to Rio, I went to Circus Circus for some 2GX Red action.

983
01:26:47,305 --> 01:26:49,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to calm my nerves down.

984
01:26:51,235 --> 01:26:51,495
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

985
01:26:51,515 --> 01:26:51,695
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

986
01:27:20,814 --> 01:27:22,134
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, let's go ahead and take another call.

987
01:27:23,215 --> 01:27:24,155
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

988
01:27:25,155 --> 01:27:26,756
[SPEAKER_25]: Hey, what's up, Mr. One and Only Ranma?

989
01:27:26,876 --> 01:27:27,716
[SPEAKER_23]: Hello, Ranma.

990
01:27:27,776 --> 01:27:29,236
[SPEAKER_23]: How are you, buddy?

991
01:27:29,816 --> 01:27:30,917
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi, Uke-chan.

992
01:27:34,277 --> 01:27:36,038
[SPEAKER_23]: Warning, cute factor approaching.

993
01:27:37,638 --> 01:27:38,599
[SPEAKER_23]: What's on your mind, my friend?

994
01:27:39,899 --> 01:27:40,379
[SPEAKER_25]: Not much.

995
01:27:40,419 --> 01:27:42,220
[SPEAKER_25]: I just had a real twisted weekend.

996
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,900
[SPEAKER_25]: I was forced to quit my job.

997
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:47,521
[SPEAKER_23]: You were forced to quit your job?

998
01:27:48,422 --> 01:27:53,726
[SPEAKER_23]: Did somebody catch you in the storeroom with the lady, you know, something like that going on, or what?

999
01:27:54,386 --> 01:27:56,948
[SPEAKER_25]: No, I actually caught somebody else violating corporate policy.

1000
01:27:58,329 --> 01:27:59,069
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, how's that work?

1001
01:27:59,109 --> 01:28:00,010
[SPEAKER_23]: You've got to explain this one to me.

1002
01:28:00,710 --> 01:28:03,152
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, on Geek Squad, you've got to sell services.

1003
01:28:03,572 --> 01:28:07,174
[SPEAKER_25]: One of the technicians was selling services, but he was pocketing the money.

1004
01:28:08,435 --> 01:28:08,795
[SPEAKER_23]: Ooh.

1005
01:28:09,376 --> 01:28:11,377
[SPEAKER_23]: So how does that mean you lose your job?

1006
01:28:13,338 --> 01:28:17,041
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm still trying... More or less, I found that they were like...

1007
01:28:17,506 --> 01:28:19,267
[SPEAKER_25]: Tracking me and following me around.

1008
01:28:19,947 --> 01:28:24,469
[SPEAKER_25]: It seems that before I went to Anamaze, I told my general manager what was going on.

1009
01:28:24,869 --> 01:28:27,250
[SPEAKER_25]: Got a customer to make a statement about what happened.

1010
01:28:27,490 --> 01:28:28,351
[SPEAKER_25]: I made my statement.

1011
01:28:28,771 --> 01:28:29,171
[SPEAKER_25]: Go away.

1012
01:28:29,531 --> 01:28:30,092
[SPEAKER_25]: I come back.

1013
01:28:30,372 --> 01:28:33,413
[SPEAKER_25]: I come to find out that one of the managers wants to talk to me.

1014
01:28:33,733 --> 01:28:40,076
[SPEAKER_25]: It seems that I'm being accused of losing money in the department and I have an issue with not coming to work.

1015
01:28:42,486 --> 01:28:47,650
[SPEAKER_23]: DarkSakura is a great... She can give you some good advice on where to go if you want to kick some butt.

1016
01:29:11,644 --> 01:29:12,704
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, I plan on it.

1017
01:29:12,825 --> 01:29:13,365
[SPEAKER_25]: Yay!

1018
01:29:14,045 --> 01:29:15,486
[SPEAKER_23]: Keep us posted on how that goes.

1019
01:29:15,526 --> 01:29:16,566
[SPEAKER_23]: How's your gaming week been?

1020
01:29:17,727 --> 01:29:18,487
[SPEAKER_25]: Pretty good, pretty good.

1021
01:29:18,527 --> 01:29:22,349
[SPEAKER_25]: I got a controller, so now I've been playing PSO a little bit more than I should be.

1022
01:29:22,629 --> 01:29:23,269
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, Blue Burst?

1023
01:29:24,049 --> 01:29:24,309
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

1024
01:29:24,810 --> 01:29:27,331
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, DarkSakura, you had a fun time in Blue Burst tonight, didn't you?

1025
01:29:27,351 --> 01:29:28,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, you need to play with me.

1026
01:29:28,451 --> 01:29:30,672
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm actually going to be starting an Orange Lounge radio team.

1027
01:29:31,593 --> 01:29:31,913
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1028
01:29:32,333 --> 01:29:33,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you playing tonight?

1029
01:29:33,733 --> 01:29:34,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I can.

1030
01:29:35,730 --> 01:29:40,013
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, only listeners are allowed to come into this room.

1031
01:29:40,773 --> 01:29:53,880
[SPEAKER_10]: I always play on Hyperion 7, and the room is Murdoch is question mark, and the password is God, with a capital G. Since I have the memory retention of a goldfish, I will be asking this a little bit later.

1032
01:29:54,301 --> 01:29:54,741
[SPEAKER_23]: That's fine.

1033
01:29:54,761 --> 01:29:58,663
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll try and post a reminder in the chat room towards the end of the show on PSO.

1034
01:29:59,043 --> 01:29:59,403
[SPEAKER_23]: Sweet.

1035
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:00,804
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, have fun with that.

1036
01:30:00,864 --> 01:30:01,925
[SPEAKER_23]: Anything else you want to share with us?

1037
01:30:02,873 --> 01:30:08,575
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, and remember I called a few weeks back and I told you about the slash pizza icon I saw at AMA Boston?

1038
01:30:08,735 --> 01:30:08,955
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

1039
01:30:10,136 --> 01:30:13,537
[SPEAKER_25]: I sent DarkSakura the picture so you could take a look at it.

1040
01:30:13,977 --> 01:30:15,158
[SPEAKER_23]: DarkSakura, do you have those pictures?

1041
01:30:15,438 --> 01:30:16,978
[SPEAKER_23]: You emailed those, right?

1042
01:30:17,618 --> 01:30:18,159
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, I did.

1043
01:30:18,379 --> 01:30:20,520
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I can hop onto my email momentarily.

1044
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:22,360
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll take a look at them during the cage match.

1045
01:30:23,341 --> 01:30:23,641
[SPEAKER_23]: Awesome.

1046
01:30:23,741 --> 01:30:24,681
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, sounds good.

1047
01:30:24,701 --> 01:30:27,602
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you for giving us a call, and we'll talk to you next time, all righty?

1048
01:30:28,362 --> 01:30:28,763
[SPEAKER_23]: You got it.

1049
01:30:28,843 --> 01:30:29,643
[SPEAKER_23]: And good luck with that.

1050
01:30:31,027 --> 01:30:32,248
[SPEAKER_23]: East Coast is waiting for you, Sky.

1051
01:30:32,568 --> 01:30:34,129
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm going to be there with bells on.

1052
01:30:34,389 --> 01:30:37,111
[SPEAKER_10]: If you need me to look up anything legal for you to help out, let me know.

1053
01:30:38,252 --> 01:30:38,952
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll be asking.

1054
01:30:39,253 --> 01:30:40,153
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, have a good one.

1055
01:30:40,774 --> 01:30:41,274
[SPEAKER_23]: Thanks a lot.

1056
01:30:41,334 --> 01:30:41,894
[SPEAKER_23]: Bye.

1057
01:30:42,455 --> 01:30:42,795
[SPEAKER_23]: Bye.

1058
01:30:42,815 --> 01:30:44,756
[SPEAKER_23]: Alrighty.

1059
01:30:46,377 --> 01:30:48,159
[SPEAKER_23]: Ranma calling in.

1060
01:30:48,179 --> 01:30:49,760
[SPEAKER_23]: A little bit of work drama going on.

1061
01:30:51,127 --> 01:30:57,412
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, what we're going to do now is we're going to go ahead and take a quick break away from the Skype line because we're actually going to go into tonight's cage match.

1062
01:30:57,512 --> 01:31:01,755
[SPEAKER_23]: So what you have to do is if you want to call into the show, we will open it up.

1063
01:31:01,955 --> 01:31:03,916
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, there's one more call coming up.

1064
01:31:03,936 --> 01:31:04,657
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll make this a quick one.

1065
01:31:05,597 --> 01:31:06,218
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm going to be nice.

1066
01:31:06,258 --> 01:31:07,139
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm in a nice mood today.

1067
01:31:07,159 --> 01:31:08,079
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll take one more call.

1068
01:31:08,119 --> 01:31:08,660
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, who's this?

1069
01:31:09,801 --> 01:31:10,721
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Reznor.

1070
01:31:11,482 --> 01:31:12,482
[SPEAKER_23]: Like Trant Reznor?

1071
01:31:13,703 --> 01:31:17,306
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I actually got the nickname from a mistake on somebody's part.

1072
01:31:17,606 --> 01:31:18,167
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, that's all right.

1073
01:31:18,207 --> 01:31:19,908
[SPEAKER_23]: I bet you get that a lot, though, don't you?

1074
01:31:19,928 --> 01:31:20,008
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

1075
01:31:20,729 --> 01:31:21,550
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, no.

1076
01:31:22,370 --> 01:31:24,151
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody keeps saying, is it like the game?

1077
01:31:25,532 --> 01:31:29,053
[SPEAKER_23]: I guess I'm the only ass out there that wants to do, alright, whatever.

1078
01:31:29,274 --> 01:31:29,794
[SPEAKER_23]: What's on your mind?

1079
01:31:29,814 --> 01:31:34,276
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, then I follow up with, yeah, I've got the vibration paddle with me in my pocket, too.

1080
01:31:36,668 --> 01:31:38,449
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, because of Rez, okay.

1081
01:31:38,589 --> 01:31:44,734
[SPEAKER_23]: It took me a minute, it took me a minute, and then I'm like, then when he starts talking about vibrating controller, I'm like, oh shit, yeah, I know that one.

1082
01:31:45,035 --> 01:31:46,576
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm an expert on vibrating games.

1083
01:31:49,158 --> 01:31:49,538
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.

1084
01:31:49,638 --> 01:31:51,160
[SPEAKER_00]: What's on your mind, Reznor?

1085
01:31:51,620 --> 01:31:54,823
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, drinking, games, stuff like that.

1086
01:31:55,143 --> 01:31:57,025
[SPEAKER_00]: You were talking about Neon FM.

1087
01:31:57,145 --> 01:31:57,385
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

1088
01:31:57,565 --> 01:32:01,709
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually know the guy, DJ Potato, one of the creators of it, I know him really well.

1089
01:32:01,809 --> 01:32:02,810
[SPEAKER_00]: Get him on my show.

1090
01:32:03,830 --> 01:32:04,230
[SPEAKER_00]: I should.

1091
01:32:04,270 --> 01:32:06,971
[SPEAKER_00]: He's actually staffing for us at MAGFest.

1092
01:32:07,191 --> 01:32:08,071
[SPEAKER_23]: What's MAGFest?

1093
01:32:09,512 --> 01:32:14,933
[SPEAKER_00]: MAGFest is a non-E3 commercial video game convention in Virginia.

1094
01:32:15,753 --> 01:32:16,073
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, cool.

1095
01:32:16,093 --> 01:32:16,693
[SPEAKER_23]: When's that happening?

1096
01:32:17,674 --> 01:32:18,374
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually coming up.

1097
01:32:18,594 --> 01:32:19,954
[SPEAKER_00]: We're skipping this year.

1098
01:32:20,074 --> 01:32:21,695
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be in January.

1099
01:32:22,155 --> 01:32:23,295
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1100
01:32:23,615 --> 01:32:26,956
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's the weekend right before OhioCon, I think.

1101
01:32:27,634 --> 01:32:31,575
[SPEAKER_23]: So do you get distributors to come out there and show off the games and everything?

1102
01:32:31,955 --> 01:32:36,336
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this will actually be our fourth year that we've been doing the convention.

1103
01:32:37,136 --> 01:32:38,896
[SPEAKER_00]: First year was pretty good.

1104
01:32:38,956 --> 01:32:41,637
[SPEAKER_00]: We had an anime premiere of Ys.

1105
01:32:42,217 --> 01:32:47,178
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the first TurboGrafx-16 ever made on display.

1106
01:32:47,258 --> 01:32:47,698
[SPEAKER_10]: I love you.

1107
01:32:48,918 --> 01:32:50,159
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually had serial number 00001.

1108
01:32:52,939 --> 01:32:55,381
[SPEAKER_10]: I want mine, please.

1109
01:32:55,701 --> 01:32:56,722
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty hot.

1110
01:32:57,342 --> 01:32:58,863
[SPEAKER_23]: I love the PC Engine.

1111
01:32:59,103 --> 01:33:05,667
[SPEAKER_23]: I thought seeing the last Dreamcast ever made was pretty hot, but the first TurboGrafx, that's pretty hot as well.

1112
01:33:06,127 --> 01:33:08,709
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they had it in a little glass case and everything.

1113
01:33:09,269 --> 01:33:13,952
[SPEAKER_00]: The con chairman said, yeah, you'll find me curled up in a ditch in Mexico with this.

1114
01:33:14,432 --> 01:33:19,355
[SPEAKER_23]: It kind of sounds like what you've got going on is similar to Classic Gaming Expo.

1115
01:33:21,170 --> 01:33:26,252
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of, yeah, but more emphasis put on the fandom, kind of like anime conventions are.

1116
01:33:26,332 --> 01:33:28,153
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's for video games only.

1117
01:33:28,513 --> 01:33:29,913
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh god, do you have cosplayers?

1118
01:33:31,954 --> 01:33:37,237
[SPEAKER_00]: Last convention we had three, and they got really pissy because we had to cosplay at two in the morning.

1119
01:33:40,358 --> 01:33:46,281
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a really good Cosmos, but obviously for an anime convention...

1120
01:33:47,068 --> 01:33:50,089
[SPEAKER_00]: Her mentality was definitely not the right one for this convention.

1121
01:33:50,669 --> 01:33:59,350
[SPEAKER_23]: You can't have a convention, you can't have a geek convention happen without some rejected Ricky Lake guest doing Sailor Moon cosplay.

1122
01:34:00,770 --> 01:34:03,071
[SPEAKER_00]: Thankfully, we didn't have any Sailor Moons or anything.

1123
01:34:03,111 --> 01:34:04,611
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all video game characters.

1124
01:34:04,651 --> 01:34:11,932
[SPEAKER_00]: We had, like, a Cid from Final Fantasy IV, and that was really cool when Tenebra Project played live.

1125
01:34:12,332 --> 01:34:15,833
[SPEAKER_00]: He almost climbed up on stage when they were doing Final Fantasy IV boss.

1126
01:34:17,237 --> 01:34:22,044
[SPEAKER_00]: For those that don't know, Jenova Project is the band that was before Mini Bosses.

1127
01:34:22,765 --> 01:34:24,288
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually had them play live, too.

1128
01:34:24,870 --> 01:34:26,671
[SPEAKER_23]: Wow, sounds like you guys have a good time out there.

1129
01:34:26,711 --> 01:34:29,211
[SPEAKER_23]: I wish we were on the East Coast so we could check it out.

1130
01:34:29,291 --> 01:34:34,273
[SPEAKER_23]: But maybe in January we'll have money in the travel budget.

1131
01:34:34,373 --> 01:34:39,194
[SPEAKER_23]: So keep looking at the change that falls on the sofa because that's the travel budget.

1132
01:34:39,215 --> 01:34:41,415
[SPEAKER_00]: We wouldn't be the only ones that would be coming from California.

1133
01:34:41,475 --> 01:34:43,756
[SPEAKER_00]: We had about 50 people come from California.

1134
01:34:43,796 --> 01:34:44,376
[SPEAKER_24]: That's nice.

1135
01:34:44,636 --> 01:34:45,176
[SPEAKER_24]: That's nice.

1136
01:34:45,997 --> 01:34:46,417
[SPEAKER_24]: Good deal.

1137
01:34:46,637 --> 01:34:50,158
[SPEAKER_24]: Dude, if I was to go there, I would cosplay as King Hippo from Mike Tyson's Punk Out.

1138
01:34:52,602 --> 01:34:55,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, one of the most underrated 8-bit characters.

1139
01:34:55,264 --> 01:34:56,245
[SPEAKER_09]: No, Eggplant Wizard.

1140
01:34:57,186 --> 01:34:59,007
[SPEAKER_00]: We need Eggplant Wizard cosplay.

1141
01:34:59,027 --> 01:35:02,690
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually want to cosplay as one of the guys from Russian Attack.

1142
01:35:03,671 --> 01:35:04,992
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, Akarnov, dude.

1143
01:35:05,372 --> 01:35:07,694
[SPEAKER_21]: Are you a bad enough dude to save the president?

1144
01:35:09,035 --> 01:35:10,256
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get a cheeseburger.

1145
01:35:13,171 --> 01:35:15,953
[SPEAKER_10]: We need a bunch of people to do Super Dodgeball cosplay.

1146
01:35:16,834 --> 01:35:18,535
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I've seen people do it.

1147
01:35:18,936 --> 01:35:24,680
[SPEAKER_10]: Or the Kunio-kun hot-blooded downtown story, also known as River City Ransom.

1148
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:30,964
[SPEAKER_00]: In EchoCon, there was actually a group of five people that cosplayed as the frat guys from RCR.

1149
01:35:32,265 --> 01:35:32,766
[SPEAKER_23]: Wow.

1150
01:35:33,366 --> 01:35:35,328
[SPEAKER_23]: Did they say barf when they hit the floor and everything?

1151
01:35:35,728 --> 01:35:36,809
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, they did.

1152
01:35:37,149 --> 01:35:37,649
[SPEAKER_00]: They did.

1153
01:35:37,749 --> 01:35:38,750
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really cool.

1154
01:35:39,130 --> 01:35:39,811
[SPEAKER_23]: That's awesome.

1155
01:35:40,578 --> 01:35:47,264
[SPEAKER_00]: They only did it because X-Strike Studios was showing RCR at River City Rumble at NekoCon, which is really cool.

1156
01:35:47,684 --> 01:35:48,265
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, wow.

1157
01:35:48,445 --> 01:35:54,390
[SPEAKER_24]: Actually, I have one more idea, and that's to dress up as Leisure Suit Larry, the original OG.

1158
01:35:55,591 --> 01:35:55,871
[SPEAKER_24]: Wow.

1159
01:35:55,891 --> 01:35:58,193
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, give Spanish Fly to the secretary.

1160
01:35:58,374 --> 01:36:00,776
[SPEAKER_23]: So how much floor space does this con take up?

1161
01:36:01,877 --> 01:36:03,318
[SPEAKER_00]: We take up the entire hotel.

1162
01:36:03,858 --> 01:36:04,399
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, that's nice.

1163
01:36:04,858 --> 01:36:06,098
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like fun.

1164
01:36:06,118 --> 01:36:07,199
[SPEAKER_00]: 24-hour game room.

1165
01:36:07,819 --> 01:36:13,401
[SPEAKER_00]: Land room is actually going to be split into four rooms because last year I actually got it up to about 68 people.

1166
01:36:14,441 --> 01:36:14,722
[SPEAKER_23]: Wow.

1167
01:36:14,762 --> 01:36:20,944
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, you know, if our podcast takes off and we're able to sell out to the man and we get a travel budget, we are so there.

1168
01:36:21,384 --> 01:36:22,064
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll check it out.

1169
01:36:22,184 --> 01:36:22,985
[SPEAKER_00]: Travel budget.

1170
01:36:23,025 --> 01:36:23,485
[SPEAKER_00]: Rock on.

1171
01:36:24,365 --> 01:36:26,446
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, right now it's about five cents.

1172
01:36:27,439 --> 01:36:29,460
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get down the block, basically.

1173
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:35,443
[SPEAKER_23]: Actually, my other idea is to establish a swear jar, because that shit would fill up fast.

1174
01:36:35,743 --> 01:36:36,463
[SPEAKER_10]: That would.

1175
01:36:36,563 --> 01:36:38,244
[SPEAKER_10]: We'd be dropping 20s every night.

1176
01:36:38,264 --> 01:36:39,964
[SPEAKER_23]: We'd be going to Hawaii every month.

1177
01:36:40,945 --> 01:36:41,305
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.

1178
01:36:41,645 --> 01:36:42,726
[SPEAKER_23]: Anything else you want to share with us?

1179
01:36:44,666 --> 01:36:47,027
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably just pimping for X-Strike.

1180
01:36:47,508 --> 01:36:50,409
[SPEAKER_00]: X-Strike Studios is going to be at AMA coming up in two weeks.

1181
01:36:51,248 --> 01:36:57,169
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be premiering Silent Horror, a video game movie that doesn't suck based on Silent Hill.

1182
01:36:57,829 --> 01:37:02,010
[SPEAKER_23]: Wait a minute, so it's like an actual movie that's going to be released in the studios?

1183
01:37:02,110 --> 01:37:03,351
[SPEAKER_23]: I kind of saw this already.

1184
01:37:03,391 --> 01:37:04,011
[SPEAKER_23]: What is this?

1185
01:37:04,031 --> 01:37:04,851
[SPEAKER_23]: The trailer for it.

1186
01:37:06,151 --> 01:37:07,971
[SPEAKER_00]: The trailer actually does no justice.

1187
01:37:08,131 --> 01:37:10,152
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, because the trailer kind of sucks.

1188
01:37:11,292 --> 01:37:12,812
[SPEAKER_00]: The trailer does suck.

1189
01:37:13,233 --> 01:37:15,053
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, wow, this makes Uevo look good.

1190
01:37:16,193 --> 01:37:20,614
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually like, it's both funny as hell, because they make fun of every, like,

1191
01:37:21,349 --> 01:37:25,831
[SPEAKER_00]: Any movie that has a line saying, it's like,

1192
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:45,841
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing with all that crap?

1193
01:37:45,881 --> 01:37:54,664
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you never know when you're going to need an empty lighter fluid can to fill up a lighter or a freakishly large statue to depress the switch.

1194
01:37:55,044 --> 01:37:56,825
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to have a well-stocked inventory.

1195
01:37:56,865 --> 01:37:59,726
[SPEAKER_23]: Do they have a distributor for it, or are they still trying to find something?

1196
01:38:01,386 --> 01:38:04,107
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually, they're sending it off to the DVD pressers.

1197
01:38:04,707 --> 01:38:05,988
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going with a different DVD...

1198
01:38:06,913 --> 01:38:09,254
[SPEAKER_00]: Press and Company that they did for River City Rumble.

1199
01:38:10,554 --> 01:38:13,776
[SPEAKER_00]: So it should be for sale at AMA.

1200
01:38:13,816 --> 01:38:15,636
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually going to kind of premiere at AMA.

1201
01:38:15,836 --> 01:38:16,316
[SPEAKER_21]: Very cool.

1202
01:38:16,336 --> 01:38:21,798
[SPEAKER_00]: Two commentaries, an outtake track, deleted scenes, director's commentary.

1203
01:38:22,239 --> 01:38:23,219
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fully loaded DVD.

1204
01:38:23,516 --> 01:38:24,597
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, good luck to those guys.

1205
01:38:24,637 --> 01:38:28,840
[SPEAKER_23]: I love B-movies with inside jokes, so that sounds like fun.

1206
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:30,121
[SPEAKER_23]: So it's a bunch of gamer nerds.

1207
01:38:30,141 --> 01:38:31,942
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure to watch the Transformer reference.

1208
01:38:32,202 --> 01:38:33,663
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a bunch of gamer nerds that did this?

1209
01:38:34,204 --> 01:38:35,004
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.

1210
01:38:35,044 --> 01:38:35,845
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, that'll be great.

1211
01:38:36,445 --> 01:38:37,126
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be great.

1212
01:38:37,146 --> 01:38:39,728
[SPEAKER_00]: It's x-strikestudios.com.

1213
01:38:39,968 --> 01:38:41,809
[SPEAKER_23]: x-strikestudios.com.

1214
01:38:41,889 --> 01:38:42,410
[SPEAKER_23]: Sounds good.

1215
01:38:42,650 --> 01:38:45,112
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, thank you for calling us, and I hope you have a good one.

1216
01:38:45,212 --> 01:38:46,052
[SPEAKER_23]: Have fun at your con.

1217
01:38:46,072 --> 01:38:46,813
[SPEAKER_00]: I need more beer.

1218
01:38:46,933 --> 01:38:47,333
[SPEAKER_23]: Seven months.

1219
01:38:47,373 --> 01:38:47,774
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.

1220
01:38:48,154 --> 01:38:49,795
[SPEAKER_23]: Hey, have another bud for us, all right?

1221
01:38:50,345 --> 01:38:51,786
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's Killian's tonight.

1222
01:38:52,226 --> 01:38:52,626
[SPEAKER_23]: Sounds good.

1223
01:38:52,726 --> 01:38:53,547
[SPEAKER_23]: Actually, have a Guinness.

1224
01:38:53,627 --> 01:38:56,028
[SPEAKER_23]: Have a Guinness for us, because the Guinness isn't really there.

1225
01:38:57,269 --> 01:38:57,549
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

1226
01:38:57,569 --> 01:38:57,909
[SPEAKER_00]: Good stuff.

1227
01:38:57,929 --> 01:38:58,690
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, have a good one, buddy.

1228
01:38:59,590 --> 01:39:00,210
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, bye.

1229
01:39:00,270 --> 01:39:00,470
[SPEAKER_23]: Later.

1230
01:39:01,851 --> 01:39:04,272
[SPEAKER_23]: Getting his name from the Rez Trans Vibrator.

1231
01:39:04,292 --> 01:39:05,753
[SPEAKER_22]: That's awesome.

1232
01:39:05,793 --> 01:39:10,736
[SPEAKER_22]: That tiramisu's got, what is it, the liqueur in it.

1233
01:39:12,874 --> 01:39:14,416
[SPEAKER_10]: It has booze, I must have some.

1234
01:39:14,456 --> 01:39:23,364
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, we're going to get some tiramisu as we get into Cage Match here because I don't really like tiramisu usually though, but is it Olive Garden tiramisu?

1235
01:39:23,664 --> 01:39:24,925
[SPEAKER_23]: No, it's tiramisu from Rayleigh's.

1236
01:39:26,306 --> 01:39:30,450
[SPEAKER_10]: I will have a small corner because I've eaten mostly meat all day.

1237
01:39:30,670 --> 01:39:31,411
[SPEAKER_23]: I will give it a try.

1238
01:39:31,531 --> 01:39:32,872
[SPEAKER_10]: I've eaten mostly meat today.

1239
01:39:35,154 --> 01:39:39,638
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, if I take this piece home and spread it out over the week, I can get away with it.

1240
01:39:42,352 --> 01:39:44,493
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, let's get into tonight's cage match, boys and girls.

1241
01:39:46,894 --> 01:40:00,121
[SPEAKER_23]: Last week in the Orange Lounge cage match, the Gorillas were entered in, and they won in a narrow victory with their song, Dare, which is kind of a dance-y song, which you don't hear from Gorillas very often, but... Sounds like a happy Monday song.

1242
01:40:00,341 --> 01:40:03,563
[SPEAKER_23]: It's very happy, but Mondays aren't happy, so I don't know what that's all about.

1243
01:40:03,643 --> 01:40:03,843
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright.

1244
01:40:05,051 --> 01:40:28,239
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyway, the way the cage match works, you must be in our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com We will play three songs for you, last week's winner, just a clip, because you already heard it last week, and two new songs in their entirety, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's video game music program, which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, on this station when we aren't live!

1245
01:40:29,380 --> 01:40:33,201
[SPEAKER_23]: And what is the criteria for these songs to be in the cage match?

1246
01:40:34,397 --> 01:40:35,418
[SPEAKER_23]: They have to kick ass.

1247
01:40:35,898 --> 01:40:36,899
[SPEAKER_23]: We just have to like them.

1248
01:40:37,039 --> 01:40:37,940
[SPEAKER_23]: That's the only criteria.

1249
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:39,902
[SPEAKER_23]: They don't have to be related to games at all.

1250
01:40:39,982 --> 01:40:42,404
[SPEAKER_23]: It's just cool stuff we think you should hear.

1251
01:40:43,045 --> 01:40:43,505
[SPEAKER_23]: So here it is.

1252
01:40:43,586 --> 01:40:44,847
[SPEAKER_23]: A clip of last week's winner.

1253
01:40:44,887 --> 01:40:45,768
[SPEAKER_23]: Song number one.

1254
01:40:45,828 --> 01:40:47,389
[SPEAKER_23]: Is it worthy of a two-week victory?

1255
01:40:47,429 --> 01:40:48,150
[SPEAKER_23]: You be the judge.

1256
01:40:48,210 --> 01:40:49,331
[SPEAKER_23]: Gorillas dare.

1257
01:42:45,633 --> 01:42:49,376
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, that was a clip of song number one, Dare, by the Gorillaz.

1258
01:42:49,836 --> 01:42:53,158
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, let's get into a new song, which we'll play in its entirety.

1259
01:42:53,198 --> 01:42:54,659
[SPEAKER_23]: This one's six minutes.

1260
01:42:54,919 --> 01:42:55,939
[SPEAKER_23]: This better be good, Loki.

1261
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:56,640
[SPEAKER_23]: What do you got for us?

1262
01:42:58,735 --> 01:43:00,796
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, it's not a Girls remix, sorry.

1263
01:43:01,096 --> 01:43:01,556
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, sorry.

1264
01:43:02,197 --> 01:43:03,797
[SPEAKER_23]: But see, now Girls Butts is okay.

1265
01:43:04,138 --> 01:43:05,818
[SPEAKER_23]: Girls by Prodigy, not okay.

1266
01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:21,586
[SPEAKER_23]: No, this is something I didn't really have much to bring this week, so I was going through some of my old CDs that have been ripping into my hard drive, and I found one on the Verse 1 and 2, which hit for me.

1267
01:43:22,006 --> 01:43:26,029
[SPEAKER_23]: And this is a remix, and I don't even remember the title of it, because it's really strange.

1268
01:43:26,609 --> 01:43:35,334
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's a remix of basically TAC stuff, and you've got... It's mainly DXY, but there's Thruanholic stuff in there as well.

1269
01:43:35,554 --> 01:43:36,935
[SPEAKER_23]: I think I've heard this before.

1270
01:43:38,236 --> 01:43:42,058
[SPEAKER_23]: It's Drexy, D-R-E-X-I-Y, I'm calling it Drexy.

1271
01:43:43,239 --> 01:43:45,640
[SPEAKER_23]: Which sounds like an eating disorder to me, but whatever.

1272
01:43:46,621 --> 01:43:46,981
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know.

1273
01:43:47,341 --> 01:43:51,264
[SPEAKER_23]: It's pretty cool, I mean, I was trying to find a short song...

1274
01:43:52,941 --> 01:43:55,383
[SPEAKER_23]: Is the artist's name really VA on this?

1275
01:43:55,743 --> 01:43:59,565
[SPEAKER_23]: No, that's just various artists because it's on Diverse Systems.

1276
01:44:00,846 --> 01:44:03,087
[SPEAKER_23]: I can look it up, but I mean, it'd take me a sec.

1277
01:44:04,288 --> 01:44:07,950
[SPEAKER_23]: But, yeah, basically, I mean, it should be enjoyable.

1278
01:44:07,990 --> 01:44:09,390
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll just say it's by Diverse Systems.

1279
01:44:09,430 --> 01:44:10,551
[SPEAKER_23]: So this is Diverse Systems.

1280
01:44:10,831 --> 01:44:12,332
[SPEAKER_23]: If you like Taku, you should like this.

1281
01:44:12,932 --> 01:44:13,613
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, here it is.

1282
01:44:14,593 --> 01:44:16,974
[SPEAKER_23]: Song number two in tonight's cage match, Drexy.

1283
01:44:17,375 --> 01:44:17,595
[SPEAKER_23]: Enjoy.

1284
01:44:18,666 --> 01:44:19,108
Thanks for watching!

1285
01:45:55,620 --> 01:45:56,203
Thanks For Watching

1286
01:46:29,362 --> 01:46:30,532
Thanks for watching!

1287
01:47:57,564 --> 01:47:58,565
Thanks for watching!

1288
01:48:46,938 --> 01:48:47,743
Thanks for watching!

1289
01:49:41,781 --> 01:49:42,522
Thanks for watching!

1290
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,901
[SPEAKER_23]: Right, that was song number two tonight, Direxy.

1291
01:50:20,081 --> 01:50:22,502
[SPEAKER_23]: Is that Direxy good or Direxy bad?

1292
01:50:22,562 --> 01:50:23,303
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's find out.

1293
01:50:23,343 --> 01:50:24,243
[SPEAKER_23]: DarkSakura.

1294
01:50:26,504 --> 01:50:33,967
[SPEAKER_10]: I liked lots of parts of it, and you know me, I love Taku, but there were parts that just sort of kind of dragged on like that part at the end.

1295
01:50:39,230 --> 01:50:39,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Seven.

1296
01:50:40,830 --> 01:50:42,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Solid, but kind of drug a bit.

1297
01:50:44,694 --> 01:50:45,675
[SPEAKER_23]: Uh, my vote.

1298
01:50:46,296 --> 01:50:46,776
[SPEAKER_23]: Whatever.

1299
01:50:47,156 --> 01:50:48,698
[SPEAKER_23]: I give it a six for the number of minutes.

1300
01:50:49,038 --> 01:50:49,378
[SPEAKER_23]: Loki.

1301
01:50:50,719 --> 01:50:52,220
[SPEAKER_23]: Next time I'm picking a ten minute song.

1302
01:50:52,260 --> 01:50:56,244
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, but I give the tiramisu a ten, by the way, because it tasted like liquor, and that makes me happy.

1303
01:50:57,659 --> 01:51:01,840
[SPEAKER_23]: I thought it was a good song, just because it reminded me a lot of the Legend of Attack song they did a long time ago.

1304
01:51:02,380 --> 01:51:09,522
[SPEAKER_23]: But, um, which I gotta do something else, because originally that Legend of Attack song was supposed to be every single Attack song in one mix.

1305
01:51:10,142 --> 01:51:12,823
[SPEAKER_23]: But, uh, I stopped before I finished.

1306
01:51:13,343 --> 01:51:16,404
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyway, um, no, I give it, like, an 8, because it's good.

1307
01:51:17,344 --> 01:51:17,744
[SPEAKER_23]: Islander.

1308
01:51:20,665 --> 01:51:24,926
[SPEAKER_24]: I'd probably give it about a 6-2, but then, because my reasoning is, it was, it...

1309
01:51:26,164 --> 01:51:27,647
[SPEAKER_24]: I too feel this is a little too long.

1310
01:51:28,609 --> 01:51:29,550
[SPEAKER_24]: We've done without a few things.

1311
01:51:30,292 --> 01:51:30,673
[SPEAKER_23]: Alrighty.

1312
01:51:32,011 --> 01:51:33,512
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's go on to song number three.

1313
01:51:33,612 --> 01:51:40,557
[SPEAKER_23]: Song number three, somebody sent me the music video for this during the week, and it reminded me about how funny this song is.

1314
01:51:40,857 --> 01:51:42,939
[SPEAKER_23]: So, and I love the video, it's so funny.

1315
01:51:43,339 --> 01:51:46,021
[SPEAKER_23]: So, um, and it's actually a pretty decent dance song.

1316
01:51:46,401 --> 01:51:53,586
[SPEAKER_23]: So, I chose this song, it's kind of like, I wouldn't say it's a remake of an 80s classic, but it invokes an 80s classic.

1317
01:51:54,087 --> 01:51:57,309
[SPEAKER_23]: So this is Eric Pryde's, and the song is called Call On Me.

1318
01:51:58,430 --> 01:51:58,730
[SPEAKER_23]: Enjoy!

1319
01:54:50,851 --> 01:54:53,713
[SPEAKER_23]: Song number three, Eric Pryde's Call On Me.

1320
01:54:54,113 --> 01:54:57,715
[SPEAKER_23]: Will you guys be calling that song back, or will you conveniently lose its number?

1321
01:54:57,795 --> 01:54:58,495
[SPEAKER_23]: DarkSakura.

1322
01:54:58,835 --> 01:55:01,797
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the original, but that one was also really repetitive.

1323
01:55:02,017 --> 01:55:09,161
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be good for DDR, I think, if it were cut down to a minute and a half, but it was just too repetitive.

1324
01:55:09,181 --> 01:55:10,482
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's a six and a half.

1325
01:55:11,568 --> 01:55:13,890
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a club song, supposed to be repetitive.

1326
01:55:13,950 --> 01:55:23,880
[SPEAKER_23]: Actually, for me, it has the same elements of a Daft Punk song, where it's simple, it can be repetitive, but it's still catchy, and it doesn't get really annoying.

1327
01:55:24,060 --> 01:55:28,925
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's what's cool about Daft Punk, and I think there may be even some Fatboy Slim songs like that and stuff.

1328
01:55:29,345 --> 01:55:34,310
[SPEAKER_23]: But it's just, it's one of those songs that lends itself to a club scene very well, so it gets a 9.

1329
01:55:34,390 --> 01:55:34,690
[SPEAKER_23]: It's good.

1330
01:55:35,512 --> 01:55:41,959
[SPEAKER_23]: Sometimes I wish we were a TV show, because honestly, that song isn't done justice without the video.

1331
01:55:42,199 --> 01:55:49,868
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, isn't the video is all these, it's women working out and like they're wearing like Jane Fonda style attire.

1332
01:55:49,908 --> 01:55:50,949
[SPEAKER_23]: It's like full on 80s.

1333
01:55:51,229 --> 01:55:52,050
[SPEAKER_23]: But here's the thing.

1334
01:55:52,471 --> 01:55:56,675
[SPEAKER_23]: Consistent tits and ass shots consistently through the video.

1335
01:55:57,756 --> 01:56:00,037
[SPEAKER_23]: I remember the video for this, and that was hilarious.

1336
01:56:00,077 --> 01:56:03,837
[SPEAKER_23]: And then there's just some random guy there, too, that's just working out.

1337
01:56:04,177 --> 01:56:04,578
[SPEAKER_23]: It's funny.

1338
01:56:04,718 --> 01:56:05,078
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know.

1339
01:56:05,778 --> 01:56:06,298
[SPEAKER_23]: I laughed.

1340
01:56:06,398 --> 01:56:07,958
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, I'm gay, and I thought it was funny.

1341
01:56:08,358 --> 01:56:10,199
[SPEAKER_23]: But maybe it's the whole boobies thing.

1342
01:56:10,239 --> 01:56:12,419
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know, because they say gay men are infatuated with boobies.

1343
01:56:12,819 --> 01:56:15,940
[SPEAKER_23]: Islander, who is not a gay man, but is still infatuated with boobies.

1344
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:17,040
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, absolutely.

1345
01:56:19,741 --> 01:56:24,962
[SPEAKER_24]: But no, I sort of agree there with Loki's comments, how it's...

1346
01:56:25,552 --> 01:56:26,973
[SPEAKER_24]: It does lend itself to the club scene.

1347
01:56:27,313 --> 01:56:31,316
[SPEAKER_24]: It's in that mold of Daft Punk and whatnot.

1348
01:56:32,076 --> 01:56:40,002
[SPEAKER_24]: And if you don't mind hearing that type of music, I for one don't, I would bump that in my car.

1349
01:56:40,062 --> 01:56:41,363
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, I'd give that probably an 8.

1350
01:56:42,558 --> 01:56:43,759
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, and eight for 80s.

1351
01:56:43,979 --> 01:56:44,359
[SPEAKER_23]: How's that?

1352
01:56:44,379 --> 01:56:44,920
[SPEAKER_23]: Absolutely.

1353
01:56:45,020 --> 01:56:45,480
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's see.

1354
01:56:45,980 --> 01:56:50,063
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, so pretty diverse selection here tonight in the cage match.

1355
01:56:50,123 --> 01:56:52,224
[SPEAKER_23]: Remember, our votes don't count for shit.

1356
01:56:52,304 --> 01:56:54,185
[SPEAKER_23]: It's all up to you guys in the chat room.

1357
01:56:54,546 --> 01:57:02,951
[SPEAKER_23]: So here it is, the three songs you can vote for tonight, starting it off with song number one, last week's winner, going for win number two, Gorilla's Dare.

1358
01:57:13,953 --> 01:57:18,778
[SPEAKER_23]: And song number two you can vote for tonight, Diverse System with Direxy.

1359
01:57:28,888 --> 01:57:32,512
[SPEAKER_23]: And song number three you can vote for tonight, Eric Pride's Call On Me.

1360
01:57:40,978 --> 01:57:43,861
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, place vote now.

1361
01:57:43,981 --> 01:57:47,564
[SPEAKER_23]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

1362
01:57:47,604 --> 01:57:49,705
[SPEAKER_23]: And if you don't know how to do that, hold on.

1363
01:57:49,825 --> 01:57:52,928
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll tell you guys in our chat room how to momentarily.

1364
01:57:53,568 --> 01:57:54,929
[SPEAKER_23]: You guys have about three minutes.

1365
01:57:55,650 --> 01:58:00,674
[SPEAKER_23]: Loki, this is the part of the show where I let you explain what's going on in the sim world.

1366
01:58:00,933 --> 01:58:03,035
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, I explained a little bit of what's going on in the sim world.

1367
01:58:03,055 --> 01:58:10,321
[SPEAKER_23]: Like, for example, there's a sim file for my song, Legend of Trance 2005, which you can find on Bamayu's cell.

1368
01:58:10,341 --> 01:58:13,703
[SPEAKER_23]: There's a few other things that happened as far as releases go.

1369
01:58:14,564 --> 01:58:20,389
[SPEAKER_23]: There was, what was it, DDRXX Mix, and I know that's a,

1370
01:58:21,061 --> 01:58:23,523
[SPEAKER_23]: Weird name, but it's Japanese, so what can we say?

1371
01:58:24,284 --> 01:58:29,008
[SPEAKER_23]: They released version 2.5, which has some more songs in it.

1372
01:58:29,508 --> 01:58:34,532
[SPEAKER_23]: It's actually a good 80 meg download, so you can go check that out as well.

1373
01:58:35,533 --> 01:58:38,775
[SPEAKER_23]: Then there's also... There's another one.

1374
01:58:39,536 --> 01:58:44,340
[SPEAKER_23]: It's actually kind of an older one that came out around the time Food Mix 1 came out.

1375
01:58:44,981 --> 01:58:48,063
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's... Oh, what's it called?

1376
01:58:48,123 --> 01:58:48,243
[SPEAKER_23]: It's...

1377
01:58:49,344 --> 01:58:54,529
[SPEAKER_23]: Party Night, Dance Dance Revolution, I guess Party Night Edition or something like that.

1378
01:58:55,429 --> 01:59:00,173
[SPEAKER_23]: They're calling it DDR Party Night Mix Appendix Series Number 1.

1379
01:59:00,253 --> 01:59:09,141
[SPEAKER_23]: That's kind of a tongue twister, but basically what that is, is a good download for you that's about, oh, I don't know.

1380
01:59:09,924 --> 01:59:13,308
[SPEAKER_23]: It's pretty big.

1381
01:59:13,348 --> 01:59:14,008
[SPEAKER_23]: 216 megs.

1382
01:59:14,048 --> 01:59:16,791
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's quite the download there.

1383
01:59:16,831 --> 01:59:17,652
[SPEAKER_23]: So go check that out.

1384
01:59:18,713 --> 01:59:22,117
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, granted, the first Party Night mix was not very good.

1385
01:59:23,317 --> 01:59:23,718
[SPEAKER_23]: DDR-D3 Mix 2.5

1386
01:59:43,174 --> 01:59:44,015
[SPEAKER_23]: Manhole Manhole

1387
02:00:04,477 --> 02:00:07,078
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, that's right, we do have the maturity level of preschool.

1388
02:00:07,778 --> 02:00:19,961
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyways, yeah, that's pretty much what's going on in the sim scene right now, so check those out, and watch BomaniStyle's sim file database, because every now and then there will be a good one.

1389
02:00:20,382 --> 02:00:27,144
[SPEAKER_23]: But in the meantime, you'll have to deal with ParanoiaTwist, Omega, and MaxEvo.

1390
02:00:29,144 --> 02:00:29,404
[SPEAKER_23]: Enjoy.

1391
02:00:31,405 --> 02:00:31,885
[SPEAKER_23]: Goody, goody.

1392
02:00:33,786 --> 02:00:38,949
[SPEAKER_23]: Just a reminder, you boys and girls out there, we have a podcast where we talk about other games.

1393
02:00:39,169 --> 02:00:42,011
[SPEAKER_23]: We talk about games that don't suck and the news you really want to know about.

1394
02:00:42,771 --> 02:00:46,713
[SPEAKER_23]: That's available on our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

1395
02:00:46,753 --> 02:00:53,457
[SPEAKER_23]: Just click on the Orange Lounge Radio to Go edition, which is over on the left-hand side, and you can download that.

1396
02:00:53,557 --> 02:00:56,899
[SPEAKER_23]: And actually, that show's been very successful for us, so we're pretty happy about that.

1397
02:00:58,380 --> 02:01:03,103
[SPEAKER_23]: Also, if you have a chance, give us a vote over on Podcast Alley because, you know, we like attention.

1398
02:01:03,163 --> 02:01:08,667
[SPEAKER_23]: Even though that site is turning into one big popularity contest, hey, you know... We like popularity.

1399
02:01:08,707 --> 02:01:09,607
[SPEAKER_23]: We like being popular.

1400
02:01:09,888 --> 02:01:10,448
[SPEAKER_23]: Doesn't everyone?

1401
02:01:11,248 --> 02:01:12,429
[SPEAKER_23]: So, give us a vote over there.

1402
02:01:12,449 --> 02:01:14,330
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll paste a link in the chat room for you guys if you want to do that.

1403
02:01:14,350 --> 02:01:18,093
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, I completely forgot to mention earlier during my, you know, week stuff.

1404
02:01:18,213 --> 02:01:24,957
[SPEAKER_23]: There was actually something... I mean, it's not, like, huge, but it was rather significant to happen this week.

1405
02:01:25,678 --> 02:01:25,818
[SPEAKER_23]: Um...

1406
02:01:27,273 --> 02:01:37,039
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, I may have made fun of this song earlier this week, or not earlier this week, but when we were talking about Karaoke Revolution 4, but Patrick Swayze came to my work.

1407
02:01:37,319 --> 02:01:38,620
[SPEAKER_23]: How many people can say that?

1408
02:01:39,320 --> 02:01:42,362
[SPEAKER_23]: Patrick Swayze came to my work as well as his wife.

1409
02:01:42,422 --> 02:01:45,063
[SPEAKER_23]: It was on Channel 3 News local here in Sacramento.

1410
02:01:45,704 --> 02:01:54,729
[SPEAKER_23]: And he was basically promoting his new movie that's going to be coming out called Last Dance, which is about his, I guess, you know, he started off classically trained as ballet.

1411
02:01:54,849 --> 02:01:56,330
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a Donna Summer song.

1412
02:01:56,821 --> 02:01:59,723
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyways, The Last Dance, it's going to be coming out.

1413
02:02:00,504 --> 02:02:01,544
[SPEAKER_23]: Last Dance.

1414
02:02:02,285 --> 02:02:03,286
[SPEAKER_23]: Last Dance.

1415
02:02:03,406 --> 02:02:03,766
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm sorry.

1416
02:02:04,106 --> 02:02:11,271
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyways, so yeah, I got an autograph and it's the same from his wife who actually directed and wrote the movie.

1417
02:02:11,932 --> 02:02:16,655
[SPEAKER_23]: And he actually flew in on his plane into the Caron Park Airport nearby here.

1418
02:02:16,735 --> 02:02:18,316
[SPEAKER_23]: So he's a pilot and all this stuff.

1419
02:02:19,093 --> 02:02:22,817
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, I realize they did a sequel to Dirty Dancing, but overlooking that piece of crap.

1420
02:02:39,793 --> 02:02:44,875
[SPEAKER_23]: They should do a new sequel to Dirty Dancing with Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey.

1421
02:02:46,516 --> 02:02:48,917
[SPEAKER_10]: They need to give her back her old nose.

1422
02:02:49,617 --> 02:03:00,542
[SPEAKER_23]: He's doing a movie right now, because this whole movie is supposed to be about going inside the mind of a dancer, what they're experiencing, so it's kind of a surreal movie in a sense.

1423
02:03:01,382 --> 02:03:04,483
[SPEAKER_23]: Dirty Dancing Sequel with the DDR Freak Movie

1424
02:03:30,503 --> 02:03:32,403
[SPEAKER_23]: Because you know how that always comes up.

1425
02:03:35,264 --> 02:03:37,225
[SPEAKER_23]: OMG to DDR Freak Movie.

1426
02:03:37,865 --> 02:03:38,885
[SPEAKER_23]: That's what it could be.

1427
02:03:38,965 --> 02:03:45,007
[SPEAKER_23]: It could be Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey reunited to win to dinner competition.

1428
02:03:46,067 --> 02:03:47,127
[SPEAKER_23]: That's ridiculous.

1429
02:03:51,488 --> 02:03:53,669
[SPEAKER_23]: And then they can get to the competition.

1430
02:03:54,209 --> 02:03:57,570
[SPEAKER_23]: And now for the final challenge where you will have to face...

1431
02:03:58,891 --> 02:04:00,652
[SPEAKER_23]: Dark, Patrick Swayze.

1432
02:04:02,874 --> 02:04:04,134
[SPEAKER_09]: DOTH Swayze!

1433
02:04:07,997 --> 02:04:08,938
[SPEAKER_22]: Use the force.

1434
02:04:14,221 --> 02:04:15,802
[SPEAKER_01]: Use the bar, Luke.

1435
02:04:22,666 --> 02:04:23,027
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't.

1436
02:04:23,187 --> 02:04:24,047
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't do this!

1437
02:04:25,478 --> 02:04:25,658
[SPEAKER_23]: Direxy

1438
02:04:51,477 --> 02:04:52,398
[SPEAKER_23]: All six minutes of it.

1439
02:04:52,618 --> 02:05:00,123
[SPEAKER_23]: And song number two that tied in tonight's cage match was... Gorillas with Dare.

1440
02:05:02,504 --> 02:05:10,689
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, the rules of a tie say that the host who put in the song that did not end up in the tie gets to break the tie.

1441
02:05:11,370 --> 02:05:12,510
[SPEAKER_23]: That's me!

1442
02:05:13,091 --> 02:05:16,533
[SPEAKER_23]: So I get to break the tie tonight because you bastards didn't vote for call on me.

1443
02:05:17,013 --> 02:05:19,535
[SPEAKER_23]: So, who loves me more?

1444
02:05:21,013 --> 02:05:22,334
[SPEAKER_10]: I buy you food sometimes.

1445
02:05:22,894 --> 02:05:23,995
[SPEAKER_10]: I brought you cake.

1446
02:05:24,195 --> 02:05:25,916
[SPEAKER_23]: That's true, you did bring me tiramisu.

1447
02:05:26,036 --> 02:05:26,837
[SPEAKER_10]: I brought you liquor.

1448
02:05:27,497 --> 02:05:32,921
[SPEAKER_23]: Uh, that's true, but, um, you know, Direxy just went on for way too long, so I have to give it to Dare tonight.

1449
02:05:32,961 --> 02:05:33,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Woohoo!

1450
02:05:35,362 --> 02:05:37,043
[SPEAKER_23]: But Dare's gone on for two weeks already.

1451
02:05:37,063 --> 02:05:39,585
[SPEAKER_23]: Too late, I've made up my mind.

1452
02:05:39,605 --> 02:05:43,668
[SPEAKER_10]: It has the mighty power of Sean Ryder and Damon.

1453
02:05:45,689 --> 02:05:47,210
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, we got a weird buzzy sound.

1454
02:05:48,611 --> 02:05:50,232
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, um, so there it is.

1455
02:05:53,286 --> 02:05:57,090
[SPEAKER_23]: Win number two for Dare, so we'll be back next week to see if it can go through.

1456
02:05:57,250 --> 02:05:58,612
[SPEAKER_23]: Dare to stay off drugs.

1457
02:06:00,543 --> 02:06:01,364
[SPEAKER_23]: Didn't they have a report?

1458
02:06:01,404 --> 02:06:04,306
[SPEAKER_10]: There are a lot of people singing that song to be saying that about.

1459
02:06:04,726 --> 02:06:06,888
[SPEAKER_23]: You want to know what a geek I was in elementary school.

1460
02:06:06,948 --> 02:06:09,970
[SPEAKER_23]: Think back to what year would this have been, like 89?

1461
02:06:11,812 --> 02:06:12,372
[SPEAKER_23]: We had the D.A.R.E.

1462
02:06:12,432 --> 02:06:13,333
[SPEAKER_23]: program in schools.

1463
02:06:13,393 --> 02:06:16,295
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know if this is a nationwide thing or just California, but D.A.R.E.

1464
02:06:16,335 --> 02:06:19,838
[SPEAKER_23]: was the Drug Abuse Resistance Education.

1465
02:06:19,958 --> 02:06:20,879
[SPEAKER_23]: I think that's what it stood for.

1466
02:06:20,939 --> 02:06:22,160
[SPEAKER_23]: It was an anti-drug program.

1467
02:06:22,360 --> 02:06:27,904
[SPEAKER_23]: But they say that it was an utter failure because what it ended up doing is it actually taught kids about all the drugs that was out there.

1468
02:06:29,121 --> 02:06:30,102
[SPEAKER_23]: That's the ones that need to be funny.

1469
02:06:30,202 --> 02:06:30,863
[SPEAKER_23]: Exactly.

1470
02:06:31,383 --> 02:06:35,107
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, methamphetamine.

1471
02:06:35,247 --> 02:06:35,748
[SPEAKER_24]: No, exactly.

1472
02:06:35,768 --> 02:06:38,571
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it's a nationwide thing.

1473
02:06:38,691 --> 02:06:43,036
[SPEAKER_24]: One of my ex-fiancé in Colorado, she was a DARE graduate twice.

1474
02:06:45,558 --> 02:06:50,944
[SPEAKER_24]: Still ended up smoking, shooting up anything she can get her hands on.

1475
02:06:52,591 --> 02:06:52,971
[SPEAKER_24]: Wow.

1476
02:06:53,091 --> 02:06:53,531
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know.

1477
02:06:54,392 --> 02:06:59,653
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to go get me some drugs now.

1478
02:06:59,773 --> 02:07:04,035
[SPEAKER_23]: Everybody in the chat room knows what I'm talking about, so they're all saying yes is nationwide, so cool.

1479
02:07:04,955 --> 02:07:06,795
[SPEAKER_23]: For our international audience, sorry, you're just screwed.

1480
02:07:08,696 --> 02:07:13,841
[SPEAKER_23]: Here's the thing, I don't know why I remember this, but I remember they had a little workbook that had all these exercises on it.

1481
02:07:13,861 --> 02:07:15,262
[SPEAKER_23]: You're supposed to identify different drugs.

1482
02:07:15,883 --> 02:07:18,745
[SPEAKER_23]: One of them was create your own license plate.

1483
02:07:19,185 --> 02:07:21,347
[SPEAKER_23]: What that has to do with drugs, I don't remember.

1484
02:07:21,868 --> 02:07:22,208
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know.

1485
02:07:22,468 --> 02:07:25,371
[SPEAKER_23]: I think it was like, if you go to jail, then you'll be making license plates.

1486
02:07:25,391 --> 02:07:26,372
[SPEAKER_23]: You'll be making license plates.

1487
02:07:27,372 --> 02:07:28,893
[SPEAKER_23]: So they had like a make your own license plate.

1488
02:07:28,913 --> 02:07:33,356
[SPEAKER_10]: But if they wanted to be really realistic, you know, they'd have to have, you know, the rubber glove up the ass.

1489
02:07:33,616 --> 02:07:35,398
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, yeah, seriously.

1490
02:07:35,438 --> 02:07:38,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Cavity surge, bend over and spread them.

1491
02:07:38,319 --> 02:07:43,303
[SPEAKER_23]: They'd have all us fifth graders take our clothes off and go shower publicly and have Bubba fuck us.

1492
02:07:44,183 --> 02:07:45,284
[SPEAKER_10]: Teach you how to make hooch.

1493
02:07:48,652 --> 02:07:50,873
[SPEAKER_10]: Here is a can of juicy juice.

1494
02:07:51,394 --> 02:07:54,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Here is yeast that we use to make the hard tack you have to eat.

1495
02:07:55,056 --> 02:07:56,416
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, wait, I'm not done with my thought yet.

1496
02:07:56,456 --> 02:08:01,599
[SPEAKER_23]: So we had to make a license plate, and the deal was, you know, you have to have it be eight letters.

1497
02:08:01,639 --> 02:08:04,661
[SPEAKER_23]: So it was like, what would your license plate say, right?

1498
02:08:05,221 --> 02:08:07,703
[SPEAKER_23]: My license plate was N-I-N-1-0-D-O.

1499
02:08:08,003 --> 02:08:08,823
[SPEAKER_23]: N-I-N-1-0-D-O.

1500
02:08:08,843 --> 02:08:08,963
[SPEAKER_23]: Get it?

1501
02:08:14,400 --> 02:08:16,301
[SPEAKER_10]: You are such a nerd and I like that.

1502
02:08:17,502 --> 02:08:19,903
[SPEAKER_23]: I wonder if anyone actually has that license plate.

1503
02:08:19,923 --> 02:08:20,844
[SPEAKER_23]: Dude, I should get it.

1504
02:08:21,984 --> 02:08:23,525
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, if nobody has it in California yet.

1505
02:08:23,585 --> 02:08:27,448
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember, Genesis does what Nintendon't.

1506
02:08:30,449 --> 02:08:30,709
[SPEAKER_10]: Suck.

1507
02:08:32,270 --> 02:08:34,712
[SPEAKER_10]: Sonic the Hedgehog, bitch.

1508
02:08:37,273 --> 02:08:38,014
[SPEAKER_10]: Bad knuckles.

1509
02:08:39,174 --> 02:08:41,856
[SPEAKER_10]: And by the way, Shadow the Hedgehog sucks ass, but he has a gun.

1510
02:08:43,284 --> 02:08:45,126
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm just reading some comments in our chat room.

1511
02:08:45,186 --> 02:08:45,606
[SPEAKER_23]: I love it.

1512
02:08:46,006 --> 02:08:48,728
[SPEAKER_23]: Ron Chan says, super sloppy OLR double dare.

1513
02:08:49,989 --> 02:08:52,171
[SPEAKER_23]: That's what dare makes you think of that show, Double Dare.

1514
02:08:53,432 --> 02:08:56,574
[SPEAKER_23]: And then I still have my dare shirt.

1515
02:08:56,634 --> 02:08:57,195
[SPEAKER_23]: That's awesome.

1516
02:08:57,275 --> 02:08:58,656
[SPEAKER_23]: I didn't think they were still doing dare.

1517
02:08:59,457 --> 02:09:03,820
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I expect to see something like that at Hot Topic soon, because they're doing like all the... Yes!

1518
02:09:04,360 --> 02:09:05,080
[SPEAKER_10]: They do have them!

1519
02:09:05,140 --> 02:09:06,381
[SPEAKER_10]: They do have them at Hot Topic!

1520
02:09:06,401 --> 02:09:06,801
[SPEAKER_10]: Do they?

1521
02:09:07,122 --> 02:09:07,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes!

1522
02:09:07,842 --> 02:09:08,863
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what would be awesome?

1523
02:09:08,883 --> 02:09:09,323
[SPEAKER_10]: I love Hot Topic.

1524
02:09:09,343 --> 02:09:15,526
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they also have the drug testing, and it has like a bunch of drugs sitting in a classroom.

1525
02:09:15,546 --> 02:09:17,388
[SPEAKER_23]: You know what I want just for the hell of it?

1526
02:09:17,568 --> 02:09:21,290
[SPEAKER_23]: I want those prop sandwiches that they had on Double there.

1527
02:09:21,630 --> 02:09:24,672
[SPEAKER_23]: I just want two of those giant pieces of bread to put on my floor.

1528
02:09:25,013 --> 02:09:25,833
[SPEAKER_23]: The foam bread.

1529
02:09:25,853 --> 02:09:27,875
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know why that would be so cool, though.

1530
02:09:28,095 --> 02:09:28,676
[SPEAKER_23]: Dude, F that.

1531
02:09:28,696 --> 02:09:29,936
[SPEAKER_23]: I want the giant hamster wheel.

1532
02:09:30,637 --> 02:09:31,378
[SPEAKER_23]: Hamster wheel?

1533
02:09:31,398 --> 02:09:32,839
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh my god, that would be cool.

1534
02:09:32,859 --> 02:09:33,779
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

1535
02:09:34,340 --> 02:09:36,041
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very funny, though, because what was his name?

1536
02:09:36,081 --> 02:09:36,662
[SPEAKER_10]: Mark Summers?

1537
02:09:37,322 --> 02:09:39,164
[SPEAKER_10]: He is supposedly such a neat freak.

1538
02:09:39,704 --> 02:09:40,665
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, he's obsessive-compulsive.

1539
02:09:40,685 --> 02:09:42,626
[SPEAKER_23]: I saw a story on some network somewhere.

1540
02:09:42,826 --> 02:09:43,127
[SPEAKER_23]: Fuck that.

1541
02:09:43,207 --> 02:09:46,149
[SPEAKER_23]: I want the big-ass nose that you would have to pick.

1542
02:09:46,169 --> 02:09:46,809
[SPEAKER_09]: To pick this?

1543
02:09:47,070 --> 02:09:48,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that was awesome.

1544
02:09:48,331 --> 02:09:48,651
[SPEAKER_23]: Dude...

1545
02:09:50,248 --> 02:09:53,030
[SPEAKER_23]: Every obstacle course had that damn hamster wheel in it somewhere.

1546
02:09:53,671 --> 02:10:00,237
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, I forgot to mention, a couple weeks ago on Family Guy, they actually referenced You Can't Do That Television.

1547
02:10:00,257 --> 02:10:03,519
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, I actually saw that episode, but we don't encourage people to watch Family Guy.

1548
02:10:03,539 --> 02:10:04,400
[SPEAKER_23]: That was a couple weeks ago.

1549
02:10:04,420 --> 02:10:07,883
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, it's on the same time as us, so we don't encourage people to go watch that.

1550
02:10:08,503 --> 02:10:09,024
[SPEAKER_23]: TiVo it!

1551
02:10:09,344 --> 02:10:11,086
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a good show, TiVo or BitTorrent.

1552
02:10:11,146 --> 02:10:11,346
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1553
02:10:12,327 --> 02:10:14,649
[SPEAKER_23]: We encourage you to pirate Family Guy because it's our competition.

1554
02:10:14,669 --> 02:10:17,131
[SPEAKER_23]: Hey, BitTorrent is mainly just free TiVo.

1555
02:10:17,171 --> 02:10:18,252
[SPEAKER_23]: That's all it is to me.

1556
02:10:19,363 --> 02:10:22,564
[SPEAKER_23]: Don't worry, I delete the episodes after 24 hours.

1557
02:10:22,644 --> 02:10:24,445
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, 24 hours so that you're not pirating it.

1558
02:10:25,226 --> 02:10:25,526
[SPEAKER_23]: Love it.

1559
02:10:27,507 --> 02:10:27,827
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright.

1560
02:10:29,227 --> 02:10:30,188
[SPEAKER_23]: We're going to go to a break.

1561
02:10:30,868 --> 02:10:34,150
[SPEAKER_23]: Featuring some music this break from Dance Maniacs.

1562
02:10:34,310 --> 02:10:35,710
[SPEAKER_23]: What about the Hannah Wavy game?

1563
02:10:36,010 --> 02:10:36,551
[SPEAKER_23]: What, what, what?

1564
02:10:37,451 --> 02:10:39,352
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh yeah, you wanted to do the clips, didn't you?

1565
02:10:39,852 --> 02:10:42,353
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll do the clips when we come back.

1566
02:10:42,733 --> 02:10:43,934
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll do the clips when we come back.

1567
02:10:43,954 --> 02:10:45,735
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll do the FUs of the week when we come back as well.

1568
02:10:46,075 --> 02:10:48,696
[SPEAKER_23]: And hopefully list lists, but we're still trying to think of a topic, so...

1569
02:10:49,693 --> 02:10:51,094
[SPEAKER_23]: You guys start thinking about that topic.

1570
02:10:54,596 --> 02:10:54,876
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright.

1571
02:10:56,217 --> 02:10:58,698

[SPEAKER_23]: Hi.

1584
02:17:07,625 --> 02:17:07,845
[SPEAKER_23]: Whoops.

1585
02:17:07,885 --> 02:17:08,085
[SPEAKER_23]: Sorry.

1586
02:17:08,105 --> 02:17:08,625
[SPEAKER_23]: We're still here.

1587
02:17:08,805 --> 02:17:10,326
[SPEAKER_23]: We forgot to queue up a promo.

1588
02:17:10,366 --> 02:17:10,706
[SPEAKER_14]: My bad.

1589
02:17:11,186 --> 02:17:11,846
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's your promo.

1590
02:17:11,866 --> 02:17:12,887
[SPEAKER_14]: My bad.

1591
02:17:12,927 --> 02:17:13,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Here you go.

1592
02:17:23,203 --> 02:17:28,985
[SPEAKER_12]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

1593
02:17:30,966 --> 02:17:33,667
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go.

1594
02:17:33,807 --> 02:17:34,327
[SPEAKER_23]: Sorry about that.

1595
02:17:35,187 --> 02:17:37,468
[SPEAKER_23]: I was too busy brainstorming for Listless.

1596
02:17:37,548 --> 02:17:40,950
[SPEAKER_23]: We're actually going to allow a guest person to come on Listless tonight.

1597
02:17:42,470 --> 02:17:47,472
[SPEAKER_23]: First person to call in Skype who wants to participate with this topic.

1598
02:17:48,232 --> 02:17:52,414
[SPEAKER_23]: Nickelodeon show you want brought back tomorrow.

1599
02:17:53,660 --> 02:17:57,121
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, so we'll take whoever calls in first, wanting to play that.

1600
02:17:57,401 --> 02:18:04,764
[SPEAKER_23]: The way listless works, everybody presents their top three, so when you call in, please have three shows that you want to do, ready to go.

1601
02:18:05,764 --> 02:18:10,466
[SPEAKER_23]: And then we'll come up with our list, and then we each take one off the list.

1602
02:18:10,506 --> 02:18:18,949
[SPEAKER_23]: You vote one off, and then the chat room ultimately gets the final vote when we have a list of eight that would be remaining.

1603
02:18:19,689 --> 02:18:21,629
[SPEAKER_23]: If that makes no sense to you, don't worry.

1604
02:18:21,750 --> 02:18:23,630
[SPEAKER_23]: It'll make sense to you as we start to go through it.

1605
02:18:25,170 --> 02:18:27,291
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's see if we get anybody in on the Skype line.

1606
02:18:27,311 --> 02:18:29,571
[SPEAKER_23]: Boy, our Skype line's lighting up now all of a sudden.

1607
02:18:29,611 --> 02:18:30,631

1608
02:18:31,051 --> 02:18:32,112
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1609
02:18:34,132 --> 02:18:34,572
[SPEAKER_23]: Hello.

1610
02:18:36,913 --> 02:18:37,813
[SPEAKER_23]: Can you hear me, caller?

1611
02:18:39,353 --> 02:18:40,573
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, sucks to be that person.

1612
02:18:40,593 --> 02:18:42,694
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's go ahead and take the next call that came in here.

02:18:43,014 --> 02:18:44,134
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1614
02:18:44,154 --> 02:18:44,254
[SPEAKER_23]: Hello.

02:18:46,516 --> 02:18:47,177
[SPEAKER_23]: Hey, it's Dubz.

1616
02:18:47,377 --> 02:18:48,878
[SPEAKER_23]: Hey, Dubz, how you doing?

1617
02:18:48,898 --> 02:18:50,760
[SPEAKER_10]: Woo, it's Dubz!

1618
02:18:51,641 --> 02:18:55,464
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, you wanna play listless with us tonight?

1619
02:18:56,085 --> 02:18:56,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

1620
02:18:56,625 --> 02:18:57,586
[SPEAKER_23]: Hot, alright.

1621
02:18:58,807 --> 02:19:02,150
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright guys, stop hammering the Skype line, we got ourselves another player here.

1622
02:19:02,190 --> 02:19:07,575
[SPEAKER_23]: But don't worry, all you guys in chat get to vote once we have a list here.

1623
02:19:07,595 --> 02:19:09,177
[SPEAKER_23]: So have you heard listless before, Dubz?

1624
02:19:10,945 --> 02:19:11,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah.

1625
02:19:11,645 --> 02:19:12,966
[SPEAKER_23]: Then you know how it works, right?

1626
02:19:13,206 --> 02:19:13,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1627
02:19:13,646 --> 02:19:14,967
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, are you thinking of your list here?

1628
02:19:15,267 --> 02:19:16,788
[SPEAKER_23]: Nickelodeon show you want them to bring back.

1629
02:19:17,288 --> 02:19:17,548
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright.

1630
02:19:17,608 --> 02:19:20,190
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, um... Wait, wait, wait, don't give it away yet.

1631
02:19:20,770 --> 02:19:22,971
[SPEAKER_23]: Think of your top three, and then we'll ask you for it.

1632
02:19:23,011 --> 02:19:24,952
[SPEAKER_23]: But you have to justify your choices, alright?

1633
02:19:25,813 --> 02:19:26,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I do?

1634
02:19:26,433 --> 02:19:27,093
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, yes you do.

1635
02:19:27,413 --> 02:19:27,694
[SPEAKER_23]: Sucks.

1636
02:19:27,854 --> 02:19:29,995
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, let's get ourselves some theme music, shall we?

1637
02:19:38,559 --> 02:19:40,260
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's get further down in the theme music here.

1638
02:19:44,215 --> 02:19:48,399
[SPEAKER_21]: That's right everybody, it's time for tonight's listless!

1639
02:19:49,880 --> 02:19:56,967
[SPEAKER_21]: Playing in tonight's listless is Sky, Loki, DarkSakura, and Doobs.

1640
02:19:57,628 --> 02:20:01,711
[SPEAKER_23]: Islander didn't want to participate tonight because he didn't have Nickelodeon as a child, you poor bastard.

1641
02:20:02,172 --> 02:20:02,452
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright.

1642
02:20:02,973 --> 02:20:04,314
[SPEAKER_23]: I want to play Flinko!

1643
02:20:05,775 --> 02:20:06,376
[SPEAKER_23]: Wrong show.

1644
02:20:07,841 --> 02:20:09,821
[SPEAKER_10]: I found the tape, by the way, Rob.

1645
02:20:10,061 --> 02:20:10,501
[SPEAKER_23]: What tape?

1646
02:20:10,721 --> 02:20:12,382
[SPEAKER_23]: The tape of you on The Price is Right.

1647
02:20:12,482 --> 02:20:13,902
[SPEAKER_23]: I wasn't actually on The Price is Right.

1648
02:20:13,922 --> 02:20:14,802
[SPEAKER_10]: But I saw you.

1649
02:20:15,342 --> 02:20:17,663
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, I was in the audience at The Price is Right.

1650
02:20:17,763 --> 02:20:18,623
[SPEAKER_10]: I had the tape with you on it.

1651
02:20:18,643 --> 02:20:19,783
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, we'll talk about that later.

1652
02:20:19,843 --> 02:20:20,763
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's get to Listless.

1653
02:20:21,143 --> 02:20:22,323
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, who's starting us off tonight?

1654
02:20:22,363 --> 02:20:23,764
[SPEAKER_23]: DarkSakura always starts us off.

1655
02:20:23,804 --> 02:20:26,244
[SPEAKER_23]: So, DarkSakura, what is your number three pick?

1656
02:20:26,444 --> 02:20:27,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Start this party up right.

1657
02:20:27,604 --> 02:20:28,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Salute your shorts.

1658
02:20:32,285 --> 02:20:35,586
[SPEAKER_23]: Brief description of the show, Salute Your Shorts, and why they should bring it back.

1659
02:20:35,886 --> 02:20:37,106
[SPEAKER_09]: It has that redhead kid.

1660
02:20:38,615 --> 02:20:41,378
[SPEAKER_23]: I wanna say the original Rugrats, like the actual one with their babies.

1661
02:20:59,778 --> 02:21:00,378
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, that one.

1662
02:21:00,458 --> 02:21:01,419
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, Rugrats.

1663
02:21:01,739 --> 02:21:03,440
[SPEAKER_23]: That was the cartoon with the babies.

1664
02:21:03,520 --> 02:21:05,021
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, yeah, I should bring that back.

1665
02:21:05,041 --> 02:21:05,962
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not still on?

1666
02:21:06,782 --> 02:21:10,325
[SPEAKER_10]: They're all like teenagers and shit.

1667
02:21:10,445 --> 02:21:12,246
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, that's bullshit.

1668
02:21:12,326 --> 02:21:13,086
[SPEAKER_23]: That's bullshit.

1669
02:21:14,547 --> 02:21:15,728
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki, your number three pick.

1670
02:21:16,649 --> 02:21:21,532
[SPEAKER_22]: My number three pick is going to be... Oh man, this is tough.

1671
02:21:23,593 --> 02:21:24,554
[SPEAKER_23]: How about...

1672
02:21:25,285 --> 02:21:25,985
[SPEAKER_23]: Pete and Pete.

1673
02:21:26,466 --> 02:21:28,827
[SPEAKER_23]: Because it was a strange show, but it actually worked.

1674
02:21:28,907 --> 02:21:30,467
[SPEAKER_10]: And the mom had a metal plate in her head.

1675
02:21:30,647 --> 02:21:31,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

1676
02:21:31,168 --> 02:21:33,209
[SPEAKER_23]: It reminds me of Malcolm in the Middle.

1677
02:21:33,689 --> 02:21:36,750
[SPEAKER_23]: It is basically, I think, is what became Malcolm in the Middle.

1678
02:21:36,810 --> 02:21:38,371
[SPEAKER_23]: So, brief description of Pete and Pete.

1679
02:21:38,431 --> 02:21:42,493
[SPEAKER_23]: Pete and Pete was just a story about two brothers that, you know, had the same name.

1680
02:21:42,553 --> 02:21:43,493
[SPEAKER_23]: They're both kind of nerdy.

1681
02:21:43,874 --> 02:21:46,875
[SPEAKER_23]: The one brother had a tattoo that he used to make dance.

1682
02:21:46,895 --> 02:21:48,616
[SPEAKER_23]: The mother had a metal plate in her head.

1683
02:21:49,076 --> 02:21:50,357
[SPEAKER_10]: She could receive radio signals.

1684
02:21:50,657 --> 02:21:52,157
[SPEAKER_23]: She could receive radio signals.

1685
02:21:52,257 --> 02:21:53,358
[SPEAKER_23]: And it was just such a weird...

1686
02:21:54,058 --> 02:21:55,359
[SPEAKER_23]: Weird Show, but it worked.

1687
02:21:55,659 --> 02:21:59,300
[SPEAKER_23]: It was just one of those shows that actually had a pretty good storyline to it, so it worked.

1688
02:21:59,600 --> 02:22:00,741
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, Pete and Pete, you're number three.

1689
02:22:00,761 --> 02:22:01,541
[SPEAKER_23]: Goddammit, I was going to say that.

1690
02:22:01,801 --> 02:22:03,522
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, you've got time to think of another one, dudes.

1691
02:22:03,802 --> 02:22:06,863
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, my number three I'm going to pick is Hey Dude.

1692
02:22:09,625 --> 02:22:12,986
[SPEAKER_23]: Because Hey Dude had the chick who married Ben Stiller, like, years later.

1693
02:22:13,186 --> 02:22:14,166
[SPEAKER_23]: Christine Taylor, remember?

1694
02:22:14,206 --> 02:22:14,527
[SPEAKER_23]: Hello?

1695
02:22:14,947 --> 02:22:15,567
[SPEAKER_23]: She was hot.

1696
02:22:17,288 --> 02:22:19,429
[SPEAKER_23]: And Hey Dude was about a dude ranch.

1697
02:22:19,529 --> 02:22:22,450
[SPEAKER_10]: She was also in, um, what was that, uh,

1698
02:22:23,595 --> 02:22:24,015
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura

1699
02:22:46,491 --> 02:22:49,494
[SPEAKER_10]: My number two one is Out of Control.

1700
02:22:50,955 --> 02:22:53,277
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just an interesting Canadian show.

1701
02:22:53,457 --> 02:22:57,661
[SPEAKER_10]: It had a guy who looked a lot like Mark Summers in it and had, what was her name, Driz?

1702
02:22:58,666 --> 02:23:01,848
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, oh man, when I was a kid I could do it.

1703
02:23:03,129 --> 02:23:03,969
[SPEAKER_23]: I can't do it anymore.

1704
02:23:03,989 --> 02:23:06,771
[SPEAKER_23]: And she used to tell the super fast jacked up fairy tales.

1705
02:23:06,811 --> 02:23:07,712
[SPEAKER_10]: I went through puberty.

1706
02:23:09,453 --> 02:23:10,834
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the sound she used to make.

1707
02:23:10,854 --> 02:23:13,395
[SPEAKER_10]: And she used to do the really funny jacked up fairy tales.

1708
02:23:13,715 --> 02:23:14,336
[SPEAKER_10]: You remember that?

1709
02:23:14,796 --> 02:23:15,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1710
02:23:15,516 --> 02:23:20,439
[SPEAKER_10]: And that show was just, it was, you know, it always came on right after You Can't Do That on television.

1711
02:23:20,459 --> 02:23:22,541
[SPEAKER_23]: And Dave Coulier cut it out.

1712
02:23:22,701 --> 02:23:23,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

1713
02:23:23,761 --> 02:23:24,022
[SPEAKER_23]: Hello.

1714
02:23:25,719 --> 02:23:28,601
[SPEAKER_10]: And I always was like, okay, this show is awesome.

1715
02:23:28,881 --> 02:23:30,243
[SPEAKER_10]: And so, yeah, that gets my number two.

1716
02:23:30,263 --> 02:23:34,766
[SPEAKER_10]: And it had the Python-esque animation in it.

1717
02:23:35,907 --> 02:23:38,870
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, figure it out.

1718
02:23:39,630 --> 02:23:42,332
[SPEAKER_23]: That show was awesome.

1719
02:23:42,353 --> 02:23:51,000
[SPEAKER_02]: It was that game show where these kids would come up and they'd have talents and people had to figure out what their talent was by asking them questions and stuff.

1720
02:23:51,260 --> 02:23:51,380
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

1721
02:23:54,062 --> 02:23:54,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, her, yeah.

1722
02:23:54,962 --> 02:23:56,463
[SPEAKER_23]: Dude, she went to my high school.

1723
02:23:57,303 --> 02:23:59,284
[SPEAKER_23]: She graduated the year before I was a freshman.

1724
02:23:59,324 --> 02:24:03,085
[SPEAKER_23]: She came back and spoke, like, years later, and so I always find that funny.

1725
02:24:03,125 --> 02:24:03,605
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know why.

1726
02:24:03,865 --> 02:24:04,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Follow your dreams.

1727
02:24:05,045 --> 02:24:06,566
[SPEAKER_23]: You can't reach your goals.

1728
02:24:06,926 --> 02:24:07,666
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm living proof.

1729
02:24:07,846 --> 02:24:09,447
[SPEAKER_23]: Her dad's a dentist somewhere near here.

1730
02:24:09,507 --> 02:24:09,827
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know.

1731
02:24:09,847 --> 02:24:11,247
[SPEAKER_23]: And then she did VO5 commercials.

1732
02:24:11,287 --> 02:24:12,007
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, figure it out.

1733
02:24:12,708 --> 02:24:14,468
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, Lokes, oh wait, is it my turn?

1734
02:24:14,488 --> 02:24:15,088
[SPEAKER_23]: No, it's Loki's turn.

1735
02:24:15,108 --> 02:24:16,069
[SPEAKER_23]: Loki, your number two pick.

1736
02:24:16,489 --> 02:24:17,309
[SPEAKER_23]: I thought it was Doob's turn.

1737
02:24:17,389 --> 02:24:18,349
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, he just went, okay.

1738
02:24:19,010 --> 02:24:23,231
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, sorry, I had a big mouthful of breadstick at the moment.

1739
02:24:23,591 --> 02:24:23,851
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyways,

1740
02:24:24,942 --> 02:24:27,543
[SPEAKER_23]: My next pick would be... Oh, man, I just had it, too.

1741
02:24:29,924 --> 02:24:30,704
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, I remember now.

1742
02:24:32,925 --> 02:24:39,647
[SPEAKER_23]: Since Eerie Indiana wasn't on Nickelodeon, as far as I'm aware, it might have been at one time, but I don't think so.

1743
02:24:40,187 --> 02:24:41,627
[SPEAKER_23]: So, Are You Afraid of the Dark?

1744
02:24:41,987 --> 02:24:45,969
[SPEAKER_23]: But, like, the first season of Are You Afraid of the Dark before got really crappy.

1745
02:24:46,609 --> 02:24:51,050
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, that's what... And this show is basically, they told, you know, kind of like ghost stories.

1746
02:24:51,090 --> 02:24:52,671
[SPEAKER_23]: It's almost like the stupid, um...

1747
02:24:53,633 --> 02:24:56,535
[SPEAKER_23]: Goosebumps book thing, you know, but it's better.

1748
02:24:58,016 --> 02:24:58,716
[SPEAKER_23]: I hate that show.

1749
02:24:59,777 --> 02:25:03,279
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, dupes, you might know which one you want to bump off then because you get to take one off the list.

1750
02:25:03,439 --> 02:25:04,760
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, well, hold on.

1751
02:25:04,800 --> 02:25:05,761
[SPEAKER_23]: There could be worse ones.

1752
02:25:05,781 --> 02:25:06,081
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll see.

1753
02:25:06,461 --> 02:25:07,662
[SPEAKER_23]: My number two pick.

1754
02:25:08,423 --> 02:25:10,064
[SPEAKER_23]: Hello, Nick Arcade.

1755
02:25:10,284 --> 02:25:10,744
[SPEAKER_23]: Hello.

1756
02:25:11,104 --> 02:25:11,485
[SPEAKER_23]: Hello.

1757
02:25:12,469 --> 02:25:12,849
[SPEAKER_23]: DarkSakura

1758
02:25:38,061 --> 02:25:39,962
[SPEAKER_10]: Mine is Danger Mouse.

1759
02:25:41,163 --> 02:25:43,004
[SPEAKER_10]: I fucking love Danger Mouse.

1760
02:25:43,584 --> 02:25:44,664
[SPEAKER_23]: Danger Mouse is pretty awesome.

1761
02:25:44,684 --> 02:25:47,866
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it's all about Penfold.

1762
02:25:49,227 --> 02:25:56,731
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just watching a tape of Danger Mouse episodes I have at my house, and it was the one where Penfold gets into the giant chicken feed and turns into a giant Penfold.

1763
02:25:59,572 --> 02:26:00,312
[SPEAKER_23]: That's pretty awesome.

1764
02:26:00,633 --> 02:26:00,873
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1765
02:26:02,473 --> 02:26:02,914
[SPEAKER_23]: Wait, hold on.

1766
02:26:02,954 --> 02:26:04,054
[SPEAKER_23]: I have something just for you, Jamie.

1767
02:26:04,394 --> 02:26:04,675
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on.

1768
02:26:05,115 --> 02:26:05,355
[SPEAKER_23]: Hold on.

1769
02:26:06,838 --> 02:26:07,398
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, damn it.

1770
02:26:07,538 --> 02:26:07,738
[SPEAKER_23]: Hold on.

1771
02:26:08,939 --> 02:26:09,699
[SPEAKER_23]: Way to go, Rob.

1772
02:26:09,759 --> 02:26:10,820
[SPEAKER_23]: Have the volume down when you play this.

1773
02:26:11,240 --> 02:26:11,880
[SPEAKER_23]: Penfold.

1774
02:26:12,441 --> 02:26:12,821
[SPEAKER_23]: Shush.

1775
02:26:14,161 --> 02:26:14,562
[SPEAKER_23]: Just for you.

1776
02:26:14,602 --> 02:26:15,782
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.

1777
02:26:15,862 --> 02:26:17,243
[SPEAKER_21]: Doobs, your number one pick.

1778
02:26:18,383 --> 02:26:18,844
[SPEAKER_02]: All that.

1779
02:26:18,864 --> 02:26:23,306
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, God.

1780
02:26:25,107 --> 02:26:25,687
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1781
02:26:25,827 --> 02:26:27,888
[SPEAKER_23]: Brief description and why it should be there.

1782
02:26:28,482 --> 02:26:31,205
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a... I say mad TV for kids.

1783
02:26:31,225 --> 02:26:32,886
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like one of those variety hour type shits.

1784
02:26:32,927 --> 02:26:33,827
[SPEAKER_02]: It still is.

1785
02:26:34,488 --> 02:26:35,009
[SPEAKER_02]: DOOBS HELP!

1786
02:26:35,209 --> 02:26:36,850
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saying... Okay, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1787
02:26:36,911 --> 02:26:38,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Han, let me say this.

1788
02:26:38,172 --> 02:26:41,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I want all that to come back before it had all those preppy white people on it.

1789
02:26:45,159 --> 02:26:45,839
[SPEAKER_23]: He's got a point.

1790
02:26:46,100 --> 02:26:46,981
[SPEAKER_23]: He does have a point.

1791
02:26:47,978 --> 02:26:48,959
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

1792
02:26:49,179 --> 02:26:52,282
[SPEAKER_23]: Islander, he said he wants it before the preppy white people ruined it.

1793
02:26:52,602 --> 02:26:52,903
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright.

1794
02:26:53,543 --> 02:26:55,725
[SPEAKER_23]: Pretty white, damn those pretty white people.

1795
02:26:55,965 --> 02:26:57,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty white people with phones.

1796
02:26:58,147 --> 02:27:01,650
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean, I mean, like, um, like, I know they have, uh, Britney Spears' sister on it now.

1797
02:27:01,670 --> 02:27:02,952
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, whoa.

1798
02:27:03,652 --> 02:27:06,635
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I remember the first couple episodes, it was all like, I remember they had, um,

1799
02:27:07,315 --> 02:27:09,556
[SPEAKER_02]: That girl from TLC sang for the intro.

1800
02:27:09,576 --> 02:27:12,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, ooh, this is, like, hip-hop type.

1801
02:27:12,357 --> 02:27:13,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I hear, like, you know.

1802
02:27:15,218 --> 02:27:17,819
[SPEAKER_23]: It's like, you know what it reminds me of?

1803
02:27:18,400 --> 02:27:20,240
[SPEAKER_23]: What he's talking about reminds me of Club MMC.

1804
02:27:23,573 --> 02:27:26,355
[SPEAKER_23]: Never mind, forget it.

1805
02:27:26,395 --> 02:27:27,937
[SPEAKER_23]: Click, click, click, ding.

1806
02:27:28,137 --> 02:27:33,541
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, but then remember when it was MMC and it was all like, you know, like, we're hip and we're white and dance hip-hop.

1807
02:27:34,842 --> 02:27:36,724
[SPEAKER_10]: My friend's mom was a Mouseketeer for a day.

1808
02:27:37,825 --> 02:27:38,025
[SPEAKER_23]: Wow.

1809
02:27:38,476 --> 02:27:38,716
[SPEAKER_10]: Roundhouse

1810
02:28:10,097 --> 02:28:10,818
[SPEAKER_23]: Roundhouse.

1811
02:28:10,878 --> 02:28:13,599
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we saw a guy from Roundhouse at E3.

1812
02:28:13,800 --> 02:28:14,940
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, the guy from Roundhouse.

1813
02:28:14,960 --> 02:28:21,745
[SPEAKER_23]: At least those guys have friggin' talent versus, you know, all that where, we're trying to be like Sarah not live, but for kids.

1814
02:28:22,706 --> 02:28:26,168
[SPEAKER_23]: And who can forget the guy from Roundhouse at E3?

1815
02:28:27,269 --> 02:28:29,470
[SPEAKER_23]: Konami, Konami-yo.

1816
02:28:29,490 --> 02:28:33,533
[SPEAKER_15]: That was him?

1817
02:28:33,713 --> 02:28:35,634
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, he was one of the pretty white kids on Roundhouse.

1818
02:28:36,115 --> 02:28:36,695
[SPEAKER_15]: That was him.

1819
02:28:37,055 --> 02:28:37,876
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.

1820
02:28:38,276 --> 02:28:39,257
[SPEAKER_23]: And Shane loved him.

1821
02:28:39,560 --> 02:28:41,321
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, Shane has a crush on him, but that's another story.

1822
02:28:41,601 --> 02:28:45,644
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, time for my number one pick, and there's so many good ones you could choose from.

1823
02:28:46,384 --> 02:28:52,248
[SPEAKER_23]: But, man, screw you all for not naming this show sooner, because this is the king of Nickelodeon shows.

1824
02:28:52,288 --> 02:28:53,328
[SPEAKER_23]: There is no doubt about it.

1825
02:28:53,909 --> 02:28:56,930
[SPEAKER_23]: Without it, you would not have Green Slime, ever.

1826
02:28:57,070 --> 02:28:59,452
[SPEAKER_23]: You can't do that on television, is my number one pick.

1827
02:28:59,472 --> 02:29:00,432
[SPEAKER_10]: I was saving it for you.

1828
02:29:00,452 --> 02:29:00,993
[SPEAKER_10]: I knew you were picking it.

1829
02:29:01,013 --> 02:29:02,674
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't name it because I knew someone else would.

1830
02:29:03,174 --> 02:29:06,956
[SPEAKER_10]: And besides that, who else but me is going to say Danger Mouse?

1831
02:29:07,797 --> 02:29:08,137
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.

1832
02:29:09,096 --> 02:29:12,678
[SPEAKER_23]: If you can't do that on television and had been taken by somebody else, I would have said Count Duckula.

1833
02:29:13,519 --> 02:29:14,699
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll have to do that on our show.

1834
02:29:14,719 --> 02:29:17,301
[SPEAKER_10]: You would have no Count Duckula without Danger Mouse.

1835
02:29:17,521 --> 02:29:17,801
[SPEAKER_23]: I know.

1836
02:29:17,841 --> 02:29:22,924
[SPEAKER_23]: If our show is ever live, we are going to do the green slime if you say I don't know.

1837
02:29:23,865 --> 02:29:25,125
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you ever see the computer one?

1838
02:29:25,465 --> 02:29:27,186
[SPEAKER_10]: It said, aha, I have a way around.

1839
02:29:27,647 --> 02:29:28,827
[SPEAKER_10]: That does not compute.

1840
02:29:29,348 --> 02:29:29,988
[SPEAKER_10]: Gray slime.

1841
02:29:30,268 --> 02:29:39,652
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, alright, let's... I remember the red slime and blue slime, and I remember the episode where you could vote by touching your TV.

1842
02:29:39,772 --> 02:29:40,372
[SPEAKER_23]: Never mind, anyway.

1843
02:29:42,153 --> 02:29:43,413
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm showing my age here, people.

1844
02:29:43,934 --> 02:29:45,674
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, here's the vote-off round.

1845
02:29:45,754 --> 02:29:47,355
[SPEAKER_23]: This is going to be a hard one tonight, you guys.

1846
02:29:47,415 --> 02:29:49,736
[SPEAKER_23]: You have to take one of these off the list.

1847
02:29:49,916 --> 02:29:52,557
[SPEAKER_23]: Salute your shorts, Rugrats, Pete and Pete.

1848
02:29:52,877 --> 02:30:02,560
[SPEAKER_23]: Hey dude, out of control, figure it out, are you afraid of the dark, Nick Arcade, Danger Mouse, all that, Roundhouse, and you can't do that on television.

1849
02:30:02,600 --> 02:30:04,160
[SPEAKER_23]: DarkSakura, what's gotta go?

1850
02:30:05,981 --> 02:30:11,302
[SPEAKER_23]: Move your big head out of the way.

1851
02:30:12,622 --> 02:30:13,483
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you afraid of the dark?

1852
02:30:14,043 --> 02:30:18,004
[SPEAKER_23]: Are you afraid of the dark gets taken off the list by DarkSakura.

1853
02:30:18,744 --> 02:30:21,905
[SPEAKER_23]: And you knew the dupes was gonna take it off, so you just gave them a free pick.

1854
02:30:23,098 --> 02:30:23,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1855
02:30:23,378 --> 02:30:24,679
[SPEAKER_10]: He can pick his nose, too.

1856
02:30:24,799 --> 02:30:26,499
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, dudes, which one's going to come off?

1857
02:30:28,800 --> 02:30:29,380
[SPEAKER_23]: Hey, dude.

1858
02:30:30,061 --> 02:30:30,821
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, you bastard.

1859
02:30:30,861 --> 02:30:32,101
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, hey, dude comes off.

1860
02:30:32,181 --> 02:30:35,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because I'm too young to remember anything that happened on that show.

1861
02:30:36,263 --> 02:30:37,523
[SPEAKER_23]: I was going to say, how old are you?

1862
02:30:37,563 --> 02:30:40,405
[SPEAKER_23]: Because your picks are more new school Nickelodeon in my eyes.

1863
02:30:40,625 --> 02:30:44,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm actually 14, but I didn't watch Nickelodeon much.

1864
02:30:44,846 --> 02:30:46,727
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1865
02:30:46,967 --> 02:30:47,587
[SPEAKER_02]: F you, okay?

1866
02:30:48,067 --> 02:30:48,428
[SPEAKER_02]: F you guys.

1867
02:30:49,088 --> 02:30:52,049
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob, actually, it was pointed out to me that not a one of us mentioned Invader Zim.

1868
02:30:53,230 --> 02:30:53,951
[SPEAKER_21]: Ah, dammit!

1869
02:30:54,551 --> 02:30:55,271
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, Loki.

1870
02:30:57,312 --> 02:31:00,374
[SPEAKER_10]: I say we have a unanimous vote to put Invader Zim on the list.

1871
02:31:02,075 --> 02:31:02,675
[SPEAKER_10]: All of us vote?

1872
02:31:02,955 --> 02:31:03,656
[SPEAKER_23]: Fine, fine.

1873
02:31:03,696 --> 02:31:04,936
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll put Invader Zim on the list.

1874
02:31:04,996 --> 02:31:05,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Woohoo!

1875
02:31:06,477 --> 02:31:08,158
[SPEAKER_23]: God, I'm so bad.

1876
02:31:08,258 --> 02:31:09,359
[SPEAKER_23]: Now that's new school, Nicola.

1877
02:31:09,379 --> 02:31:11,200
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, Loki, take one of these off the list.

1878
02:31:11,600 --> 02:31:18,124
[SPEAKER_23]: Dammit, you know, these took off my Hey Dude Because I Was Gonna Say That Show bit compared to, you know, like, say, Sleezy Shorts.

1879
02:31:18,604 --> 02:31:20,625
[SPEAKER_23]: But I'm gonna take off Rugrats because...

1880
02:31:21,756 --> 02:31:25,720
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, that used to be on, was it, you know, Nick Jr.

1881
02:31:26,040 --> 02:31:28,022
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's where it needs to stay, is Nick Jr.

1882
02:31:28,703 --> 02:31:30,524
[SPEAKER_10]: It needs to be back there by pinwheel.

1883
02:31:31,765 --> 02:31:32,466
[SPEAKER_23]: Spinning around.

1884
02:31:32,786 --> 02:31:34,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Pinwheel, pinwheel, spinning around.

1885
02:31:34,968 --> 02:31:35,509
[SPEAKER_23]: My turn, huh?

1886
02:31:36,189 --> 02:31:40,573
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm gonna have to take off, um... I'm gonna take off Roundhouse.

1887
02:31:40,954 --> 02:31:41,194
[SPEAKER_23]: I just...

1888
02:31:43,305 --> 02:31:45,966
[SPEAKER_23]: There's too many sketch comedy shows on Nickelodeon.

1889
02:31:46,026 --> 02:31:46,646
[SPEAKER_23]: Nah, I do.

1890
02:31:46,686 --> 02:31:47,687
[SPEAKER_23]: I have excellent taste.

1891
02:31:47,767 --> 02:31:48,847
[SPEAKER_23]: You can't do that on television better.

1892
02:31:49,167 --> 02:31:55,250
[SPEAKER_23]: What would you do on that stupid... Nobody said Double Dare, but I guess they have a new version of Double Dare.

1893
02:31:55,310 --> 02:31:56,230
[SPEAKER_23]: Lots of shows not named.

1894
02:31:56,291 --> 02:31:56,611
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright.

1895
02:31:57,231 --> 02:31:59,992
[SPEAKER_23]: Here it is, the list that you guys can vote on.

1896
02:32:00,092 --> 02:32:01,013
[SPEAKER_23]: Salute your shorts.

1897
02:32:01,433 --> 02:32:02,753
[SPEAKER_23]: Pete and Pete.

1898
02:32:02,873 --> 02:32:04,214
[SPEAKER_23]: Doobs, what the hell are you doing over there?

1899
02:32:05,256 --> 02:32:06,717
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, my thing's just messing up.

1900
02:32:07,298 --> 02:32:08,979
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, that's alright.

1901
02:32:09,079 --> 02:32:15,564
[SPEAKER_23]: Salute your shorts, Pete and Pete, Out of Control, Figure It Out, Nick Arcade, Danger Mouse, all that.

1902
02:32:15,925 --> 02:32:19,007
[SPEAKER_23]: You can't do that on television and Invader Zim.

1903
02:32:19,327 --> 02:32:20,689
[SPEAKER_23]: You guys can send a vote.

1904
02:32:20,729 --> 02:32:21,950
[SPEAKER_23]: You get to vote for one.

1905
02:32:22,290 --> 02:32:25,492
[SPEAKER_23]: Send a private message to Sky in the chatroom with your vote.

1906
02:32:26,613 --> 02:32:28,995
[SPEAKER_23]: Some of the ones we missed, you guys, according to the chatroom.

1907
02:32:29,436 --> 02:32:31,677
[SPEAKER_23]: Count Duckula, Ren and Stimpy,

1908
02:32:32,957 --> 02:32:34,038
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, that's a big one.

1909
02:32:34,138 --> 02:32:40,803
[SPEAKER_23]: Actually, I think Vader Zim should come off the list because while it's still, um, it is a cancelled show, they still rerun it.

1910
02:32:41,263 --> 02:32:42,984
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm saying no, we already put him there.

1911
02:32:43,605 --> 02:32:46,206
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, Amanda's show?

1912
02:32:46,667 --> 02:32:47,007
[SPEAKER_23]: No.

1913
02:32:47,367 --> 02:32:48,648
[SPEAKER_23]: Clarissa Explains It All.

1914
02:32:48,668 --> 02:32:50,489
[SPEAKER_23]: Clarissa Explains It All, thank you.

1915
02:32:50,509 --> 02:32:53,872
[SPEAKER_10]: I liked Clarissa Explains It All because the guy who came in through the window.

1916
02:32:53,892 --> 02:32:57,074
[SPEAKER_23]: She never taught me about sexuality, she didn't explain it all.

1917
02:33:01,557 --> 02:33:02,578
[SPEAKER_02]: I would also say Turkey Television.

1918
02:33:17,469 --> 02:33:19,331
[SPEAKER_23]: But nobody remembers that show, not a damn person.

1919
02:33:19,631 --> 02:33:21,212
[SPEAKER_23]: Today's special.

1920
02:33:21,773 --> 02:33:23,334
[SPEAKER_23]: I remember today's special.

1921
02:33:23,655 --> 02:33:25,596
[SPEAKER_23]: Doug, Pinwheels.

1922
02:33:26,077 --> 02:33:27,078
[SPEAKER_23]: Doug is now on Disney.

1923
02:33:27,098 --> 02:33:27,758
[SPEAKER_23]: I mentioned Pinwheels.

1924
02:33:27,818 --> 02:33:30,000
[SPEAKER_23]: It's actually on Disney in the morning now.

1925
02:33:30,020 --> 02:33:31,221
[SPEAKER_23]: Dang, that show's been going forever then.

1926
02:33:31,762 --> 02:33:33,443
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, well, dudes, thanks for playing.

1927
02:33:33,463 --> 02:33:34,905
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll let you know how it turns out, alright?

1928
02:33:34,925 --> 02:33:35,825
[SPEAKER_23]: Yay.

1929
02:33:36,126 --> 02:33:38,228
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, thanks for playing and have a good one, okay?

1930
02:33:38,848 --> 02:33:39,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Later.

1931
02:33:42,847 --> 02:33:44,467
[SPEAKER_23]: You just wanted to say boobs on our show.

1932
02:33:45,088 --> 02:33:46,208
[SPEAKER_23]: Rocko's Modern Life.

1933
02:33:46,328 --> 02:33:48,349
[SPEAKER_10]: That's okay, we say boobs all the time.

1934
02:33:48,409 --> 02:33:49,749
[SPEAKER_10]: Boobs, boobs, boobs, boobs, boobs, boobs.

1935
02:33:49,789 --> 02:33:59,132
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, Rocko's Modern Life, the characters from Rocko is supposed to have like a cameo in the, or not the Rugrats movie, the Spongebob movie, but I don't remember seeing them.

1936
02:33:59,372 --> 02:34:02,873
[SPEAKER_23]: Fucking Spongebob Squarepants, but again, that's all.

1937
02:34:02,913 --> 02:34:03,513
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank God.

1938
02:34:03,533 --> 02:34:04,793
[SPEAKER_23]: That's all Nickelodeon is now.

1939
02:34:05,573 --> 02:34:08,274
[SPEAKER_23]: I hate Spongebob.

1940
02:34:08,314 --> 02:34:10,295
[SPEAKER_23]: Dude, Spongebob is not that bad.

1941
02:34:11,175 --> 02:34:13,419
[SPEAKER_23]: No, technically all that is still on there too.

1942
02:34:14,020 --> 02:34:14,260
[SPEAKER_22]: Is it?

1943
02:34:14,540 --> 02:34:15,522
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, it's still on there.

1944
02:34:15,542 --> 02:34:16,183
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

1945
02:34:16,363 --> 02:34:21,170
[SPEAKER_23]: Because now that one of the guys from it actually is on Saturday Night Live, they're like, oh, we're famous now.

1946
02:34:21,751 --> 02:34:21,992
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

1947
02:34:22,753 --> 02:34:23,834
[SPEAKER_23]: So, whatever.

1948
02:34:24,821 --> 02:34:27,102
[SPEAKER_23]: Legend of the Hidden Temple was freaking awesome and Guts was on my list.

1949
02:34:45,974 --> 02:34:50,056
[SPEAKER_10]: But I took it off in favor of whatever the first one was.

1950
02:34:50,796 --> 02:34:52,397
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Guts was a good idea.

1951
02:34:52,877 --> 02:34:55,318
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll just remember the referee that they had on the show.

1952
02:34:55,358 --> 02:34:57,019
[SPEAKER_23]: We have all these veggie cords.

1953
02:34:57,059 --> 02:34:58,119
[SPEAKER_23]: What are we going to do with them?

1954
02:34:58,179 --> 02:35:00,280
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's play every game with them.

1955
02:35:00,300 --> 02:35:02,241
[SPEAKER_23]: The aggro crag.

1956
02:35:02,261 --> 02:35:05,323
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's climb up the big glowing purple hunk of plastic.

1957
02:35:05,503 --> 02:35:07,363
[SPEAKER_23]: Uh-oh, I got aggroed by the crag.

1958
02:35:07,984 --> 02:35:11,445
[SPEAKER_10]: You lost ten minutes because you didn't hit the little charger thing.

1959
02:35:11,665 --> 02:35:12,466
[SPEAKER_10]: You suck.

1960
02:35:12,786 --> 02:35:14,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Time to go back to kindergarten.

1961
02:35:15,546 --> 02:35:15,846
[SPEAKER_23]: And the NFM?

1962
02:35:32,665 --> 02:35:33,425
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, the Neon FM.

1963
02:35:33,445 --> 02:35:34,145
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll get to that, too.

1964
02:35:34,185 --> 02:35:34,826
[SPEAKER_23]: I promise we will.

1965
02:35:35,186 --> 02:35:35,446
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.

1966
02:35:35,786 --> 02:35:36,346
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll get to that.

1967
02:35:36,966 --> 02:35:39,327
[SPEAKER_23]: So let's get those votes in real quick because we're going to get to the FUs of the week.

1968
02:35:39,387 --> 02:35:44,228
[SPEAKER_23]: Don't send your FUs just yet, though, because we've got to get the votes for listless out of the way first.

1969
02:35:44,288 --> 02:35:47,129
[SPEAKER_23]: So we'll be back after this quick break with more Orange Lounge Radio.

1970
02:36:10,999 --> 02:36:11,980
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for watching!

1971
02:36:37,499 --> 02:36:41,879
[SPEAKER_16]: Go on the mic, word up, this groove is set to soon Move you, fuck people now, it's time to

1972
02:37:12,902 --> 02:37:13,368
and many more.

1973
02:37:46,736 --> 02:37:47,544
Thanks for watching!

1974
02:38:46,761 --> 02:38:49,743
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, technically this next song is from second mix, but Jamie begged.

1975
02:38:49,903 --> 02:38:50,263
[SPEAKER_09]: I cried.

1976
02:39:15,006 --> 02:39:18,200
[SPEAKER_15]: Now I realize, it's all the love I'm bringing

1977
02:40:16,821 --> 02:40:27,026
[SPEAKER_12]: We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1978
02:40:27,246 --> 02:40:29,086
[SPEAKER_23]: Love by Sonic Dream from Second Mix.

1979
02:40:29,126 --> 02:40:30,107
[SPEAKER_23]: Before that, Bakwa.

1980
02:40:31,107 --> 02:40:33,648
[SPEAKER_23]: And starting us off, Extreme Wonderland.

1981
02:40:33,668 --> 02:40:36,370
[SPEAKER_23]: I heard Miracle last night when I was at Red Lobster.

1982
02:40:40,219 --> 02:40:41,041
[SPEAKER_14]: Miracles.

1983
02:40:41,122 --> 02:40:43,228
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, from Max too.

1984
02:40:43,288 --> 02:40:43,689
[SPEAKER_23]: No, Max.

1985
02:40:43,769 --> 02:40:44,070
[SPEAKER_23]: Max.

1986
02:40:44,632 --> 02:40:47,520
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, you want to find out tonight's listless winners?

1987
02:40:48,854 --> 02:40:49,554
[SPEAKER_23]: We did the votes.

1988
02:40:49,634 --> 02:40:50,514
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, Kay, thanks.

1989
02:40:51,075 --> 02:40:51,935
[SPEAKER_23]: This was a toughie.

1990
02:40:51,975 --> 02:40:53,955
[SPEAKER_23]: We had a lot of votes kind of spread out tonight.

1991
02:40:54,035 --> 02:40:57,416
[SPEAKER_23]: Everybody loves Nickelodeon, so I'm glad we could talk about it here.

1992
02:40:57,516 --> 02:40:58,676
[SPEAKER_23]: Nobody loves MTV, though.

1993
02:40:59,196 --> 02:40:59,637
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, nobody.

1994
02:41:00,577 --> 02:41:06,138
[SPEAKER_23]: Seriously, I actually watched a little bit of MTV for the first time in a long time yesterday.

1995
02:41:06,178 --> 02:41:10,659
[SPEAKER_23]: There was a marathon of Next, which is some type of speed dating show.

1996
02:41:10,739 --> 02:41:11,259
[SPEAKER_23]: It's awful.

1997
02:41:11,860 --> 02:41:12,520
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I remember.

1998
02:41:12,600 --> 02:41:13,520
[SPEAKER_23]: I've seen that show.

1999
02:41:13,900 --> 02:41:17,681
[SPEAKER_23]: What about, they also had a marathon yesterday, I thought, of True Life.

2000
02:41:20,278 --> 02:41:23,399
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't watch TV, so I have no idea what the fuck either of you are talking about.

2001
02:41:39,086 --> 02:41:42,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, no, I'd have to see that, because that would be hilarious.

2002
02:41:42,448 --> 02:41:44,449
[SPEAKER_23]: True, they honestly had that, it was great.

2003
02:41:44,469 --> 02:41:47,210
[SPEAKER_23]: True Life is actually one of the few decent series they have now, I think.

2004
02:41:47,290 --> 02:41:51,292
[SPEAKER_23]: But, like, all these, like, you know what my friends are into, and I don't get this at all.

2005
02:41:51,412 --> 02:42:00,476
[SPEAKER_23]: They don't watch the real world, they don't watch Road Rules, but what they do watch is that fucking, like, Inferno show, where it's like real world meets Road Rules on, I don't know, whatever.

2006
02:42:00,536 --> 02:42:03,018
[SPEAKER_23]: Isn't, like, MTV All Reality shows nowadays now?

2007
02:42:03,658 --> 02:42:04,078
[SPEAKER_23]: Pretty much.

2008
02:42:04,739 --> 02:42:05,359
[SPEAKER_23]: It's MTV.

2009
02:42:07,967 --> 02:42:17,810
[SPEAKER_24]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2010
02:42:37,373 --> 02:42:38,013
[SPEAKER_24]: Liquid Television.

2011
02:42:38,914 --> 02:42:40,235
[SPEAKER_10]: And I remember Pauly Shore.

2012
02:42:40,295 --> 02:42:42,296
[SPEAKER_23]: You know that Aeon Flux movie is coming out next year?

2013
02:42:42,936 --> 02:42:43,536
[SPEAKER_23]: Or is it this year?

2014
02:42:44,097 --> 02:42:44,997
[SPEAKER_23]: I think I'm going to see that.

2015
02:42:45,037 --> 02:42:47,799
[SPEAKER_23]: It looks kind of, I don't know.

2016
02:42:48,519 --> 02:42:51,881
[SPEAKER_24]: However, there's one show that I do watch sort of.

2017
02:42:52,221 --> 02:42:53,842
[SPEAKER_24]: My guilty pleasure on TV is Pimp My Ride.

2018
02:42:55,062 --> 02:42:59,985
[SPEAKER_24]: Because I want to take my mom's ice cream truck and see what they can do with that.

2019
02:43:02,410 --> 02:43:05,011
[SPEAKER_23]: They love crap like that, you know, where it's just like something weird.

2020
02:43:05,991 --> 02:43:14,893
[SPEAKER_23]: You know what my guilty... I'm actually going to go see Aeon Flux, you know, but my guilty pleasure movie of this year, which is an MTV movie actually, is going to be Roll Bounce.

2021
02:43:15,653 --> 02:43:16,373
[SPEAKER_23]: The hell's that?

2022
02:43:16,533 --> 02:43:24,775
[SPEAKER_23]: Roll Bounce is a movie set in the 70s during the roller disco era, and it's actually... I remember roller disco!

2023
02:43:24,795 --> 02:43:25,975
[SPEAKER_23]: Basically, it is...

2024
02:43:27,361 --> 02:43:30,062
[SPEAKER_23]: It is, um, You Got Served on Roller Skates.

2025
02:43:30,102 --> 02:43:30,622
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, look.

2026
02:43:30,642 --> 02:43:32,402
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to see that!

2027
02:43:32,482 --> 02:43:34,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, no, my fucking... It's looking awesome, okay?

2028
02:43:35,103 --> 02:43:40,784
[SPEAKER_23]: Look, people, we'll do the MTV show they need to bring back at a later date, but we gotta get rid of tonight's list list first.

2029
02:43:40,804 --> 02:43:41,844
[SPEAKER_23]: Check out the trailer, though.

2030
02:43:41,864 --> 02:43:42,924
[SPEAKER_23]: It's online on Apple.

2031
02:43:43,064 --> 02:43:43,464
[SPEAKER_22]: Check it out.

2032
02:43:43,944 --> 02:43:44,885
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, let's do this.

2033
02:43:45,245 --> 02:43:46,945
[SPEAKER_23]: Uh, top three list list tonight.

2034
02:43:47,525 --> 02:43:48,745
[SPEAKER_23]: Nickelodeon show they should bring back.

2035
02:43:48,806 --> 02:43:50,206
[SPEAKER_23]: Number third, number three.

2036
02:43:50,226 --> 02:43:51,426
[SPEAKER_23]: Number third.

2037
02:43:51,546 --> 02:43:52,066
[SPEAKER_23]: Number third.

2038
02:43:52,086 --> 02:43:55,587
[SPEAKER_23]: Uh, You Can't Do That on Television in third place tonight.

2039
02:43:56,713 --> 02:44:00,115
[SPEAKER_23]: In second place tonight, Invader Zim.

2040
02:44:01,136 --> 02:44:01,817
[SPEAKER_23]: Rightfully so.

2041
02:44:02,297 --> 02:44:05,699
[SPEAKER_23]: In first place, what are the gamers going to say?

2042
02:44:06,640 --> 02:44:07,200
[SPEAKER_23]: What do you think?

2043
02:44:07,240 --> 02:44:08,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Nick Arcade.

2044
02:44:08,101 --> 02:44:10,543
[SPEAKER_23]: Nick Arcade in first place, you guys.

2045
02:44:12,144 --> 02:44:14,265
[SPEAKER_23]: Good job, tonight's list list.

2046
02:44:14,646 --> 02:44:16,387
[SPEAKER_23]: I would watch it if they brought any of those shows back.

2047
02:44:16,909 --> 02:44:18,350
[SPEAKER_23]: They need to have Nick Classic.

2048
02:44:18,851 --> 02:44:19,091
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright.

2049
02:44:19,271 --> 02:44:20,532
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, they have gas.

2050
02:44:20,692 --> 02:44:24,415
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I have gas too, but you know what?

2051
02:44:24,436 --> 02:44:25,777
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not going to be watching it.

2052
02:44:25,937 --> 02:44:28,679
[SPEAKER_23]: They need Nick Classic.

2053
02:44:28,979 --> 02:44:31,962
[SPEAKER_23]: Honestly, the old school shows need to just run the reruns.

2054
02:44:32,322 --> 02:44:32,663
[SPEAKER_23]: Who cares?

2055
02:44:33,143 --> 02:44:36,466
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, let's get on to tonight's FUs or we're going to run out of time here.

2056
02:44:36,506 --> 02:44:38,908
[SPEAKER_23]: So, Jamie, why do we do the FUs of the week every single week?

2057
02:44:39,789 --> 02:44:43,812
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I hate everybody and everything and I just need to slip my wrist.

2058
02:44:52,980 --> 02:44:58,762
[SPEAKER_10]: I want my god damn car you bitches!

2059
02:44:59,762 --> 02:45:01,643
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I have been, oh hi ferret.

2060
02:45:04,924 --> 02:45:10,126
[SPEAKER_10]: I have been without a car, okay get this, I've been without a car now for a month!

2061
02:45:10,886 --> 02:45:11,226
[SPEAKER_10]: A month!

2062
02:45:12,127 --> 02:45:13,067
[SPEAKER_10]: A month with no ride!

2063
02:45:21,321 --> 02:45:28,692
[SPEAKER_10]: I need a car this week and I need my god damn three thousand dollars check to be here now

2064
02:45:29,997 --> 02:45:42,603
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I don't care when the fuck you mailed it, you should have sent that shit Federal Express to my door, hand-delivered by, you know, young boys dressed in, you know, old pageboy livery or something, I don't know.

2065
02:45:43,464 --> 02:45:44,985
[SPEAKER_10]: It should have been at my door.

2066
02:45:45,525 --> 02:45:47,786
[SPEAKER_10]: It should have been in my hand a week ago.

2067
02:45:47,806 --> 02:45:50,207
[SPEAKER_10]: It should have been in my hand three weeks ago.

2068
02:45:50,507 --> 02:45:51,148
[SPEAKER_10]: I need a car.

2069
02:45:51,748 --> 02:45:52,088
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

2070
02:45:54,289 --> 02:45:54,850
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki.

2071
02:45:56,190 --> 02:45:57,011
[SPEAKER_23]: I only have two.

2072
02:45:58,035 --> 02:46:02,544
[SPEAKER_23]: The first one is this fucking headache that's been on my head for two days.

2073
02:46:02,985 --> 02:46:09,178
[SPEAKER_23]: I say on my head because it switched from the right side to the left side last night.

2074
02:46:09,611 --> 02:46:16,034
[SPEAKER_23]: So now whatever parasite it is in my head is on my left side, and it still hurts, and it's the Sunday headache.

2075
02:46:16,314 --> 02:46:17,895
[SPEAKER_23]: And I don't know why I can't get rid of it.

2076
02:46:17,935 --> 02:46:22,438
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyways, and the second thing goes to, well I actually have three.

2077
02:46:22,578 --> 02:46:27,540
[SPEAKER_23]: So the second thing goes to the servers on Final Fantasy because they're still crashing.

2078
02:46:28,040 --> 02:46:33,983
[SPEAKER_23]: And they should have fixed this months ago, and I don't know why they can't seem to fend off a stupid DNS attack.

2079
02:46:34,444 --> 02:46:36,925
[SPEAKER_23]: It's just a DNS attack, come on, people, you know, fix it.

2080
02:46:37,737 --> 02:47:04,712
[SPEAKER_23]: and the third goes to the phone company for some reason charging me $80 when they should be charging me $40 for the first time thing and they're saying that I'm like there's some non uh some sort of charges that are non you know standard charges or whatever like 32 bucks I'm like what the hell is this I don't have any extra services so I have to call them and find out what that is tomorrow so that's it my turn

2081
02:47:11,153 --> 02:47:14,213
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm going to give an F you to missing deadlines at work, because that really sucks.

2082
02:47:14,633 --> 02:47:20,355
[SPEAKER_23]: I want to give an F you to earwax, because apparently I had a really bad buildup of earwax in one of my ears.

2083
02:47:20,835 --> 02:47:22,615
[SPEAKER_23]: No, look, this is a totally normal thing, okay?

2084
02:47:22,635 --> 02:47:23,115
[SPEAKER_23]: Y'all get it.

2085
02:47:23,776 --> 02:47:28,777
[SPEAKER_23]: I had a really bad buildup, and I actually lost hearing in my right ear a couple days ago.

2086
02:47:29,077 --> 02:47:30,277
[SPEAKER_23]: And I was totally freaked out.

2087
02:47:30,357 --> 02:47:36,939
[SPEAKER_23]: I was like, oh my god, I'm going to be deaf, and I do radio as a hobby, I'm going to be screwed for the rest of my life, I'll never be able to play DDR again.

2088
02:47:36,959 --> 02:47:38,259
[SPEAKER_23]: That's why I have one of those cool

2089
02:47:39,600 --> 02:47:47,965
[SPEAKER_23]: I was trying to clean my ear with a Q-tip, like a normal sanitary person would do.

2090
02:47:48,225 --> 02:47:54,949
[SPEAKER_23]: That's actually very bad for you, because what I did is I actually pushed the wax in further with a Q-tip and made myself lose hearing.

2091
02:47:54,969 --> 02:47:56,409
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, don't push it in, you gotta go around.

2092
02:47:56,429 --> 02:47:58,991
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, that's what I was trying to do, but somehow I pushed it in.

2093
02:47:59,271 --> 02:48:05,895
[SPEAKER_23]: So anyway, kids, if you have your wax filled up, go to the store and get the liquid that you put in your ear, because that's the only way you're gonna do it.

2094
02:48:06,926 --> 02:48:08,007
[SPEAKER_23]: Don't use a Q-tip, I went down the highway.

2095
02:48:08,027 --> 02:48:08,567
[SPEAKER_23]: Go swim in a pool.

2096
02:48:09,288 --> 02:48:10,129
[SPEAKER_23]: Swim in a pool, folks.

2097
02:48:10,449 --> 02:48:10,729
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright.

2098
02:48:12,290 --> 02:48:13,491
[SPEAKER_23]: And I guess that's it.

2099
02:48:13,651 --> 02:48:17,575
[SPEAKER_23]: So, an FU to $15 copays to get your earwax removed, that's pretty bad.

2100
02:48:18,175 --> 02:48:20,537
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, let's go to Islander.

2101
02:48:23,179 --> 02:48:24,620
[SPEAKER_23]: FU to airborne viruses.

2102
02:48:27,463 --> 02:48:31,526
[SPEAKER_24]: Why can't more diseases be like, I don't know, HIV?

2103
02:48:33,014 --> 02:48:38,676
[SPEAKER_24]: It's like, you know, you know what you have to do to get it, so if you just avoid that, you won't get it?

2104
02:48:39,816 --> 02:48:40,076
[SPEAKER_24]: No.

2105
02:48:40,476 --> 02:48:44,557
[SPEAKER_24]: The flu has to be something you can just give to someone by talking to them.

2106
02:48:45,557 --> 02:48:45,858
[SPEAKER_24]: Damn it.

2107
02:48:48,878 --> 02:48:49,519
[SPEAKER_24]: That's pretty much it.

2108
02:48:49,759 --> 02:48:50,019
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright.

2109
02:48:50,619 --> 02:48:51,739
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank God you can't catch ugly.

2110
02:48:57,601 --> 02:49:00,381
[SPEAKER_23]: OMG, it's OMG Tits Boobs.

2111
02:49:02,022 --> 02:49:02,442
[SPEAKER_23]: Awesome.

2112
02:49:03,857 --> 02:49:05,717
[SPEAKER_09]: He took my suggestion.

2113
02:49:05,857 --> 02:49:06,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that doobs?

2114
02:49:06,738 --> 02:49:07,558
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, it's doobs.

2115
02:49:07,758 --> 02:49:14,419
[SPEAKER_23]: OMG Tits Boobs says, F you to my girlfriend being able to beat me on Paranoia Survivor Max Oni Shuffle.

2116
02:49:15,939 --> 02:49:18,900
[SPEAKER_23]: F you to Brazilian people on MMOs again because they suck at English.

2117
02:49:19,380 --> 02:49:20,480
[SPEAKER_23]: What a great generalization.

2118
02:49:21,420 --> 02:49:24,161
[SPEAKER_23]: And F you to my 13-year-old cousin for living in New York so long.

2119
02:49:24,201 --> 02:49:26,081
[SPEAKER_23]: He's like a big drug dealer now and he's 13.

2120
02:49:26,441 --> 02:49:29,342
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, and F you for living in Florida because my house is infested with bugs.

2121
02:49:31,300 --> 02:49:36,424
[SPEAKER_23]: LemonLimeJump sent in a late vote for, um... Sorry, I thought that was an FU.

2122
02:49:37,825 --> 02:49:40,667
[SPEAKER_23]: DarkTetsuya says, F you to hire next morning.

2123
02:49:41,688 --> 02:49:43,450
[SPEAKER_23]: I guess he's going for the AAAs or something.

2124
02:49:45,131 --> 02:49:48,874
[SPEAKER_23]: Ron Chan says, F you to my old job for fucking me over, as he said earlier.

2125
02:49:49,154 --> 02:49:51,916
[SPEAKER_23]: That's okay, because I'm going to CompUSA, your competition.

2126
02:49:52,256 --> 02:49:53,938
[SPEAKER_23]: Who's getting pwned now, bitches?

2127
02:49:54,997 --> 02:49:55,517
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

2128
02:49:55,898 --> 02:49:57,659
[SPEAKER_10]: They're fucking you over, fuck them back.

2129
02:49:57,879 --> 02:49:59,300
[SPEAKER_23]: I love it when I get to say pwned.

2130
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:08,906
[SPEAKER_23]: Dark Knight says, my FU goes to work being a bitch and not feeling appreciated when I bust my ass going out of my way to satisfy customers, even though I'm just a cashier.

2131
02:50:10,547 --> 02:50:19,173
[SPEAKER_23]: Illusion says, FU to my uncle's wife's gay brother that is covering it up by marrying a woman that is so into herself that she won't need any love for herself's wife's.

2132
02:50:20,220 --> 02:50:22,041
[SPEAKER_23]: I need a map to figure that one out.

2133
02:50:22,101 --> 02:50:28,803
[SPEAKER_23]: 30th birthday party that was full of boring rich people that only played corny songs like, This song is for all the girls, or whatever it was.

2134
02:50:29,683 --> 02:50:38,706
[SPEAKER_23]: F you to not being able to go to karaoke because of this party, and F you to the weekend being boring because of nothing to do this weekend, but I did finally get to watch Rocky Horror Picture Show.

2135
02:50:39,306 --> 02:50:40,246
[SPEAKER_23]: That coming from Illusion.

2136
02:50:41,406 --> 02:50:42,127
[SPEAKER_10]: Congratulations.

2137
02:50:43,687 --> 02:50:46,768
[SPEAKER_23]: Ninst says, F you to my computer for acting up lately.

2138
02:50:48,124 --> 02:50:56,149
[SPEAKER_23]: Reznor says, a big fuck you to customers that can't keep their kids from putting used condoms in their computer's floppy drive.

2139
02:50:56,669 --> 02:50:57,710
[SPEAKER_23]: You've got to be kidding.

2140
02:51:00,411 --> 02:51:00,872
[SPEAKER_23]: Wow.

2141
02:51:01,812 --> 02:51:03,413
[SPEAKER_23]: I didn't know you could fit that in there.

2142
02:51:03,573 --> 02:51:04,654
[SPEAKER_23]: Wowie, wowie, wow.

2143
02:51:04,674 --> 02:51:05,274
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, they're kids.

2144
02:51:06,615 --> 02:51:07,616
[SPEAKER_23]: What the hell would you think?

2145
02:51:07,896 --> 02:51:08,256
[SPEAKER_23]: Hmm.

2146
02:51:09,036 --> 02:51:09,977
[SPEAKER_23]: Used condom receptacle.

2147
02:51:09,997 --> 02:51:14,740
[SPEAKER_23]: Dude, there's people that think the CD-ROM is a coffee tray, so, or a coffee cup tray thing.

2148
02:51:14,760 --> 02:51:15,800
[SPEAKER_23]: I can at least see that.

2149
02:51:16,960 --> 02:51:19,304
[SPEAKER_24]: My question is, where do these kids get the used condoms?

2150
02:51:20,366 --> 02:51:21,087
[SPEAKER_24]: From their parents?

2151
02:51:21,548 --> 02:51:25,936
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you should, like, hide that shit, or, like, better, or something.

2152
02:51:26,998 --> 02:51:27,900
[SPEAKER_23]: Here, leave me alone, go play this.

2153
02:51:30,647 --> 02:51:32,288
[SPEAKER_23]: Go blow up these balloons.

2154
02:51:33,149 --> 02:51:37,892
[SPEAKER_23]: Sugaru-chan says, F you to Ultramix and Ultramix 2 for having such horrible music.

2155
02:51:38,272 --> 02:51:39,092
[SPEAKER_23]: I disagree, but whatever.

2156
02:51:39,112 --> 02:51:41,414
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, actually, some girl got AIDS from that.

2157
02:51:41,494 --> 02:51:41,974
[SPEAKER_23]: Stop it.

2158
02:51:42,534 --> 02:51:45,636
[SPEAKER_23]: And for their not having more Konami-Bomani games in the US.

2159
02:51:46,357 --> 02:51:49,939
[SPEAKER_23]: Sugaru-chan says, last F you for my boyfriend using me and cosplay.

2160
02:51:52,554 --> 02:51:59,759
[SPEAKER_23]: DarkLionXVI says, F you to David Williams for calling my pocket aces with his 6-7 of clubs on the World Series of Poker.

2161
02:51:59,819 --> 02:52:00,660
[SPEAKER_23]: No limit tourney.

2162
02:52:01,220 --> 02:52:05,783
[SPEAKER_23]: The flop came 8-5-9 of clubs for the straight flush, eliminating me in the process.

2163
02:52:06,364 --> 02:52:10,446
[SPEAKER_23]: F you to myself for playing one more lovely another, forgetting to turn off hard mode.

2164
02:52:11,027 --> 02:52:11,247
[SPEAKER_23]: Oops.

2165
02:52:12,526 --> 02:52:22,380
[SPEAKER_23]: And lastly, Iguana Girl says, F you to bad car batteries and corrosion that causes Jessica to be stuck out in the heat and wind for seven and a half hours.

2166
02:52:23,582 --> 02:52:23,742
[SPEAKER_23]: Ouch.

2167
02:52:26,704 --> 02:52:27,825
[SPEAKER_23]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2168
02:52:54,925 --> 02:52:57,145
[SPEAKER_23]: They have had commercials!

2169
02:52:57,526 --> 02:52:59,346
[SPEAKER_23]: I have seen commercials on VH1!

2170
02:52:59,706 --> 02:53:00,366
[SPEAKER_23]: Advertising!

2171
02:53:00,586 --> 02:53:01,686
[SPEAKER_23]: Become a Hooter Girl!

2172
02:53:01,766 --> 02:53:03,127
[SPEAKER_23]: I was like, it's coming!

2173
02:53:03,707 --> 02:53:04,347
[SPEAKER_23]: It's coming!

2174
02:53:04,847 --> 02:53:05,527
[SPEAKER_23]: Soon!

2175
02:53:05,787 --> 02:53:09,308
[SPEAKER_23]: We are like, what, the last city in the nation to get a Hooters.

2176
02:53:10,008 --> 02:53:12,508
[SPEAKER_23]: Seriously, LA has 5 billion.

2177
02:53:12,548 --> 02:53:16,449
[SPEAKER_23]: I think Sacramento is the last city in the nation, big city, to get a Hooters.

2178
02:53:17,049 --> 02:53:17,889
[SPEAKER_23]: We're finally getting one.

2179
02:53:18,089 --> 02:53:20,070
[SPEAKER_23]: We're also getting Logan's Roadhouse, which also makes me happy.

2180
02:53:22,352 --> 02:53:28,116
[SPEAKER_23]: Somebody in the chat room is yelling at me because they already signed to our website.

2181
02:53:28,256 --> 02:53:29,156
[SPEAKER_24]: I got busted.

2182
02:53:29,356 --> 02:53:33,359
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, there's actually someone down the street from where I live who does this for a living.

2183
02:53:34,240 --> 02:53:34,600
[SPEAKER_24]: Straight up.

2184
02:53:35,040 --> 02:53:36,061
[SPEAKER_24]: Dancing Dan.

2185
02:53:37,101 --> 02:53:40,063
[SPEAKER_24]: If he doesn't have a gig going, his sign says, hire me.

2186
02:53:41,444 --> 02:53:41,864
[SPEAKER_24]: Wow.

2187
02:53:42,305 --> 02:53:45,687
[SPEAKER_23]: And this guy, this dude says, $11.50 an hour is what he makes doing that.

2188
02:53:45,707 --> 02:53:45,887
[SPEAKER_23]: Holy.

2189
02:53:46,681 --> 02:53:47,041
[SPEAKER_23]: I know.

2190
02:53:47,281 --> 02:53:49,402
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, well, I mean, like, for just doing that?

2191
02:53:50,082 --> 02:53:50,802
[SPEAKER_23]: Now I understand.

2192
02:53:50,822 --> 02:53:55,884
[SPEAKER_23]: Try to put Nelly on the corner, man, because she's not making that kind of money.

2193
02:53:56,124 --> 02:53:58,845
[SPEAKER_23]: You are going to put your fiancé on the corner, have her work the corner.

2194
02:53:59,705 --> 02:54:01,526
[SPEAKER_23]: Seriously, that's some good money there.

2195
02:54:01,806 --> 02:54:02,446
[SPEAKER_23]: That's awesome.

2196
02:54:02,766 --> 02:54:04,727
[SPEAKER_23]: Plus, she's bitching about not having a tan.

2197
02:54:04,807 --> 02:54:05,307
[SPEAKER_23]: There you go.

2198
02:54:06,347 --> 02:54:07,068
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a twofer.

2199
02:54:10,309 --> 02:54:11,369
[SPEAKER_23]: You're a bastard.

2200
02:54:13,069 --> 02:54:14,150
[SPEAKER_23]: Who would want to marry you?

2201
02:54:18,223 --> 02:54:18,463
[SPEAKER_23]: Neon FM

2202
02:54:47,346 --> 02:54:51,770
[SPEAKER_23]: Sounds like a lot of Naoki songs I've heard before, but that's kind of cute that they invoke that.

2203
02:54:51,850 --> 02:54:53,371
[SPEAKER_23]: So, what do you guys think, real quickly?

2204
02:54:53,952 --> 02:54:55,453
[SPEAKER_10]: Naoki.

2205
02:54:55,673 --> 02:54:57,454
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know what the point of 1981 is.

2206
02:54:57,995 --> 02:54:58,375
[SPEAKER_23]: Whatever.

2207
02:54:58,455 --> 02:54:59,296
[SPEAKER_23]: Bride and Dream.

2208
02:55:15,984 --> 02:55:19,370
[SPEAKER_23]: Dude, it's like an Ayumi Tamasaki techno song.

2209
02:55:20,172 --> 02:55:22,476
[SPEAKER_10]: Time to drop some E and go to a rave.

2210
02:55:22,656 --> 02:55:26,704
[SPEAKER_23]: I have heard that whole song before, I remember, somewhere, and it's really good.

2211
02:55:26,844 --> 02:55:27,826
[SPEAKER_23]: That's kind of hot, I like that.

2212
02:55:27,886 --> 02:55:28,588
[SPEAKER_23]: Bring the beat back.

2213
02:55:43,117 --> 02:55:44,818
[SPEAKER_24]: Wow, that bitch is off-key.

2214
02:55:45,678 --> 02:55:46,298
[SPEAKER_24]: Is it just me?

2215
02:55:46,979 --> 02:55:53,402
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, well, once she's off-key, and I think for me, for that song to be cool, they need to lose that techno-ish aspect.

2216
02:55:54,823 --> 02:55:55,203
[SPEAKER_23]: It's okay.

2217
02:55:55,243 --> 02:55:56,644
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm actually liking this so far, though.

2218
02:55:56,684 --> 02:55:57,284
[SPEAKER_23]: This isn't bad.

2219
02:55:57,304 --> 02:55:57,804
[SPEAKER_23]: I like this.

2220
02:55:57,864 --> 02:55:58,765
[SPEAKER_23]: Can you feel the music?

2221
02:56:15,097 --> 02:56:16,258
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, that's Can You Feel the Music.

2222
02:56:16,298 --> 02:56:16,838
[SPEAKER_23]: I kind of like that.

2223
02:56:17,558 --> 02:56:20,280
[SPEAKER_23]: Do you have an artist list up so we can tell you who the artists of these songs are?

2224
02:56:20,300 --> 02:56:20,860
[SPEAKER_23]: I have to look.

2225
02:56:20,900 --> 02:56:23,701
[SPEAKER_23]: Go to the site so we can get some of that, because I only have the song titles here.

2226
02:56:23,762 --> 02:56:24,702
[SPEAKER_23]: You like that one, DarkSakura?

2227
02:56:25,502 --> 02:56:26,643
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I do like that one a whole bunch.

2228
02:56:26,663 --> 02:56:28,004
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, Complete Shot.

2229
02:56:31,426 --> 02:56:32,126
[SPEAKER_23]: Here's the earlier...

2230
02:56:35,120 --> 02:56:36,161
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh yeah, we heard this one earlier.

2231
02:56:36,261 --> 02:56:36,741
[SPEAKER_23]: That's alright.

2232
02:56:37,622 --> 02:56:38,863
[SPEAKER_23]: Wait, what was that song again?

2233
02:56:38,923 --> 02:56:39,604
[SPEAKER_23]: Complete Shot.

2234
02:56:39,704 --> 02:56:40,424
[SPEAKER_23]: No, the one before that.

2235
02:56:41,145 --> 02:56:41,945
[SPEAKER_23]: Can You Feel the Music.

2236
02:56:42,066 --> 02:56:43,647
[SPEAKER_23]: Can You Feel the Music.

2237
02:56:44,808 --> 02:56:45,648
[SPEAKER_23]: There's a song list on there.

2238
02:56:45,668 --> 02:56:46,429
[SPEAKER_23]: Why are you going to that page?

2239
02:56:46,789 --> 02:56:48,891
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, I'm going to... This is the same page.

2240
02:56:48,931 --> 02:56:53,435
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm just looking to see... Whatever.

2241
02:56:53,455 --> 02:56:54,075
[SPEAKER_23]: We've got to get through this.

2242
02:56:54,095 --> 02:56:54,696
[SPEAKER_23]: We're running out of show.

2243
02:56:54,756 --> 02:56:55,136
[SPEAKER_23]: Control...

2244
02:57:09,631 --> 02:57:14,012
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait, this song's familiar.

2245
02:57:14,772 --> 02:57:15,333
[SPEAKER_23]: I like that one.

2246
02:57:15,353 --> 02:57:15,933
[SPEAKER_23]: That's pretty cool.

2247
02:57:15,953 --> 02:57:18,774
[SPEAKER_23]: That's a different drum song, I think.

2248
02:57:19,174 --> 02:57:19,694
[SPEAKER_23]: I think it is.

2249
02:57:20,054 --> 02:57:20,854
[SPEAKER_23]: Is that the Alien 6?

2250
02:57:21,354 --> 02:57:22,054
[SPEAKER_23]: No, no, no.

2251
02:57:22,154 --> 02:57:25,235
[SPEAKER_23]: That's... Damn, because I've heard of that.

2252
02:57:25,535 --> 02:57:26,115
[SPEAKER_23]: The Nine.

2253
02:57:26,696 --> 02:57:30,977
[SPEAKER_23]: It's from... It's a free... Or not a... A different drum song.

2254
02:57:30,997 --> 02:57:33,778
[SPEAKER_23]: You can actually get the whole song on Amazon for free.

2255
02:57:34,698 --> 02:57:35,698
[SPEAKER_23]: Because I know I've listened to that.

2256
02:57:36,298 --> 02:57:36,678
[SPEAKER_23]: The Nine.

2257
02:57:36,698 --> 02:57:37,018
[SPEAKER_23]: You're right.

2258
02:57:37,058 --> 02:57:37,379
[SPEAKER_23]: That's it.

2259
02:57:38,059 --> 02:57:38,659
[SPEAKER_23]: Enough of you.

2260
02:57:41,994 --> 02:57:42,554
[SPEAKER_23]: Thomas Howard.

2261
02:57:42,714 --> 02:57:44,114
[SPEAKER_23]: Thomas Howard.

2262
02:57:45,115 --> 02:57:46,475
[SPEAKER_23]: Yay, a ballad.

2263
02:57:46,595 --> 02:57:47,755
[SPEAKER_23]: OLR staff favorite.

2264
02:57:47,915 --> 02:57:50,456
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't wait to play this.

2265
02:57:50,476 --> 02:57:52,356
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, let's run through this here.

2266
02:57:52,416 --> 02:57:53,197
[SPEAKER_17]: Gotta Kick My Love.

2267
02:57:53,237 --> 02:57:53,877
[SPEAKER_17]: Sounds like Togo.

2268
02:58:05,169 --> 02:58:05,410
[SPEAKER_10]: Haruharu

2269
02:58:25,390 --> 02:58:27,091
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi-G doing that one.

2270
02:58:27,712 --> 02:58:36,798
[SPEAKER_23]: Hiro is the guy that does Gotta Kick My Love right now, and you can go to his website, www.hiro777.com.

2271
02:58:37,938 --> 02:58:38,879
[SPEAKER_23]: Nation's World.

2272
02:58:39,620 --> 02:58:44,783
[SPEAKER_23]: I hate this song.

2273
02:58:46,724 --> 02:58:48,205
[SPEAKER_23]: This song came out a long time ago.

2274
02:58:49,006 --> 02:58:53,569
[SPEAKER_23]: Again, we're playing clips from new songs on Neon FM, which are available on Neon FM's website, yes?

2275
02:58:53,589 --> 02:58:53,649
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

2276
02:58:54,068 --> 02:58:56,849
[SPEAKER_23]: DJ Potato featuring THL, this is Putter in Reverse

2277
02:59:23,038 --> 02:59:23,319
[SPEAKER_24]: What?

2278
02:59:24,420 --> 02:59:26,441
[SPEAKER_24]: I feel like I should be waving my hands in a per-per-motion.

2279
02:59:26,662 --> 02:59:27,222
[SPEAKER_24]: Seriously.

2280
02:59:27,262 --> 02:59:28,864
[SPEAKER_24]: Sexy, sexy, sexy.

2281
02:59:28,944 --> 02:59:29,905
[SPEAKER_24]: Rhinestone Cowboy.

2282
02:59:40,569 --> 02:59:41,710
[SPEAKER_23]: That's Ricky and Daz.

2283
02:59:41,730 --> 02:59:43,632
[SPEAKER_23]: That's actually kind of a commercially known song.

2284
02:59:43,652 --> 02:59:45,533
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, Ricky and Daz, the Space Cats.

2285
02:59:45,553 --> 02:59:52,618
[SPEAKER_23]: You can go to SpaceCats.com Oh, so that's why it sounds like Bus Stop, because those are the singers from Bus Stop.

2286
02:59:53,859 --> 02:59:54,459
[SPEAKER_23]: Aha!

2287
02:59:54,780 --> 02:59:55,380
[SPEAKER_15]: Gotcha!

2288
02:59:55,640 --> 02:59:56,181
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why.

2289
02:59:56,241 --> 02:59:58,082
[SPEAKER_23]: You guys know this one if you've ever played Frequency.

2290
03:00:01,284 --> 03:00:01,705
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

2291
03:00:02,762 --> 03:00:04,023
[SPEAKER_23]: Dude, Freeze Pop rocks.

2292
03:00:04,043 --> 03:00:04,483
[SPEAKER_23]: You shut up.

2293
03:00:04,503 --> 03:00:05,844
[SPEAKER_23]: That was Science Genius.

2294
03:00:05,944 --> 03:00:09,226
[SPEAKER_10]: I like some Freeze Pop, I just didn't care for that Freeze Pop song.

2295
03:00:09,966 --> 03:00:15,369
[SPEAKER_23]: DJ Siamie, I don't know, DJ Siamie, Siamie, I think so, with Skyward.

2296
03:00:26,456 --> 03:00:27,497
[SPEAKER_23]: Not bad, not bad.

2297
03:00:27,897 --> 03:00:29,638
[SPEAKER_23]: Freeze Pop, again, Stakeout.

2298
03:00:41,124 --> 03:00:48,129
[SPEAKER_23]: That's the song that almost got retired in the cage match, but Jamie decided in a tie vote its fourth week to go for the other song.

2299
03:00:49,510 --> 03:00:52,732
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, that much freeze pop every so often makes my head want to go floaty.

2300
03:00:52,852 --> 03:00:53,572
[SPEAKER_23]: You'll love this.

2301
03:00:53,652 --> 03:00:55,193
[SPEAKER_23]: Super Sprode is another song.

2302
03:00:57,635 --> 03:00:58,696
[SPEAKER_10]: I should like Super Sprode.

2303
03:00:59,937 --> 03:01:01,137
[SPEAKER_10]: It's in a minor key.

2304
03:01:03,919 --> 03:01:06,081
[SPEAKER_23]: DJ Potato with Tune In.

2305
03:01:10,816 --> 03:01:12,297
[SPEAKER_23]: This is a theme song also.

2306
03:01:16,520 --> 03:01:17,801
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know for a theme song.

2307
03:01:17,821 --> 03:01:18,421
[SPEAKER_23]: That's a little weird.

2308
03:01:18,541 --> 03:01:25,285
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, they had a different version of that, or cut of that, but actually it was really good when I saw the preview video.

2309
03:01:26,126 --> 03:01:28,628
[SPEAKER_23]: Alien number 613, You Got the City.

2310
03:01:32,930 --> 03:01:34,371
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm digging this one.

2311
03:01:34,411 --> 03:01:36,693
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes me think of Chemical Love from Bust a Move.

2312
03:01:36,873 --> 03:01:37,974
[SPEAKER_24]: I am really digging that.

2313
03:01:39,215 --> 03:01:39,695
[SPEAKER_23]: Definitely.

2314
03:01:41,404 --> 03:01:43,857

[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know.

2319
03:02:55,448 --> 03:02:58,130

[SPEAKER_23]: Loki, your final thought for tonight.

2321
03:03:02,491 --> 03:03:08,454
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, I had something, and I can't remember what it was, but, uh, all I'm gonna say is two things.

2322
03:03:08,934 --> 03:03:12,215
[SPEAKER_23]: One, go vote for our podcast on Podcast Alley.

2323

[SPEAKER_23]: So check out that page, it's got a spiffy little thing you can download.

2328
03:03:44,632 --> 03:03:49,614
[SPEAKER_23]: It's on there, and also there's a cool little banner that I made, and it's pretty nice.

03:03:49,794 --> 03:03:50,495
[SPEAKER_23]: So anyways, check it out.

[SPEAKER_23]: LokiFusion, all one word.

2332
03:03:54,776 --> 03:03:56,137
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, I'll put that in the chat room as well.

2333
03:03:57,077 --> 03:04:06,080
[SPEAKER_23]: My final thought is, because I promised somebody I would say it again, Hyperion 7, Murdoch is password God, right?

2334
03:04:06,460 --> 03:04:07,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that's where I play.

2335
03:04:08,413 --> 03:04:09,514
[SPEAKER_23]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

2336

2337
03:04:15,561 --> 03:04:18,184
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, and final word of the show.

2338
03:04:18,244 --> 03:04:20,026
[SPEAKER_23]: You know I gotta give it to the guests when we have one.

2339
03:04:20,126 --> 03:04:21,788
[SPEAKER_23]: Islander, one word that sums it all up.

[SPEAKER_23]: We appreciate you tuning in tonight.

2342
03:04:24,351 --> 03:04:26,493
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, one word isn't gonna do it.

2343
03:04:26,994 --> 03:04:27,614
[SPEAKER_24]: It has to be two.

2344
03:04:28,015 --> 03:04:28,936
[SPEAKER_12]: Ghostbots.

2345
03:04:30,413 --> 03:04:33,435
[SPEAKER_12]: And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

2346
03:05:02,518 --> 03:05:03,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Approach, students.

2347
03:05:04,499 --> 03:05:07,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Close the circle at the feet of the Master.

2348
03:05:09,161 --> 03:05:14,844
[SPEAKER_07]: You have come to me asking that I be your guide along the path of Tai Kwan Leap.

2349
03:05:15,825 --> 03:05:22,268
[SPEAKER_07]: But be warned, to learn its ways, you must learn the ways of your own soul.

2350
03:05:23,348 --> 03:05:25,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Let us meditate upon this wisdom now.

2351
03:05:26,270 --> 03:05:30,972
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Aum.

2352
03:05:32,811 --> 03:05:34,653
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, sir?

2353
03:05:34,993 --> 03:05:35,453
[SPEAKER_18]: Sir?

2354
03:05:36,014 --> 03:05:37,215
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, oh, sir?

2355
03:05:37,575 --> 03:05:42,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Who disturbs our meditation as a pebble disturbs the stillness of the pond?

2356
03:05:42,780 --> 03:05:43,060
[SPEAKER_18]: Me.

2357
03:05:45,783 --> 03:05:46,664
[SPEAKER_18]: Ed Gruberman?

2358
03:05:51,428 --> 03:05:52,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Ed Gruberman.

2359
03:05:52,869 --> 03:05:57,013
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, uh, no disrespect or nothing, but like, how long is this gonna take?

2360
03:05:58,578 --> 03:06:04,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Taekwon Leap is not a path to a door, but a road leading forever towards the horizon.

2361
03:06:05,524 --> 03:06:07,506
[SPEAKER_18]: So like, what, an hour or so?

2362
03:06:10,908 --> 03:06:14,011
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, we have not even begun upon the path.

2363
03:06:14,632 --> 03:06:16,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Ed Gruberman, you must learn patience.

2364
03:06:16,893 --> 03:06:17,974
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, patience.

2365
03:06:18,014 --> 03:06:18,915
[SPEAKER_18]: How long will that take?

2366
03:06:21,517 --> 03:06:22,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Time has no meaning.

2367
03:06:23,479 --> 03:06:26,161
[SPEAKER_07]: To a true student, a year is as a day.

2368
03:06:26,201 --> 03:06:26,602
[SPEAKER_07]: A year?! !

2369
03:06:27,392 --> 03:06:29,293
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to beat people up right now.

2370
03:06:29,974 --> 03:06:32,375
[SPEAKER_18]: I got the pajamas.

2371
03:06:39,240 --> 03:06:40,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Beat people up?

2372
03:06:40,581 --> 03:06:44,424
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, just show me all those nifty moves so I can start trashing bozos.

2373
03:06:44,864 --> 03:06:46,105
[SPEAKER_18]: That's all I came here for.

2374
03:06:46,405 --> 03:06:52,249
[SPEAKER_07]: The only use of Taekwondo is self-defense.

2375
03:06:52,809 --> 03:06:53,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know who said that?

2376
03:06:54,490 --> 03:06:56,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Ki Lo Ni, the great teacher.

2377
03:06:57,225 --> 03:06:57,545
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah?

2378
03:06:57,985 --> 03:07:00,387
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, the best defense is a good offense.

2379
03:07:00,427 --> 03:07:01,407
[SPEAKER_18]: You know who said that?

2380
03:07:02,068 --> 03:07:03,528
[SPEAKER_18]: Mel, the cook on Alice.

2381
03:07:05,850 --> 03:07:15,054
[SPEAKER_07]: No, um... Taekwon Lip is the wine of purity, not the vinegar of hostility.

2382
03:07:15,755 --> 03:07:17,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Meditate upon this truth with us.

2383
03:07:19,697 --> 03:07:19,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh...

2384
03:07:20,419 --> 03:07:21,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Listen, shrimp.

2385
03:07:21,799 --> 03:07:25,780
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, are you going to show me some fancy moves, or am I going to start wiping the walls with you?

2386
03:07:26,260 --> 03:07:29,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Ed Gruberman, you failed to grasp Taekwon Leap.

2387
03:07:29,381 --> 03:07:30,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Approach me that you might see.

2388
03:07:31,301 --> 03:07:32,701
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, finally some action.

2389
03:07:33,121 --> 03:07:34,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Observe closely, class.

2390
03:07:35,942 --> 03:07:36,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Boot to the head.

2391
03:07:39,862 --> 03:07:42,323
[SPEAKER_15]: Ow, you're pulling me in the head!

2392
03:07:43,423 --> 03:07:44,863
[SPEAKER_07]: You are lucky, Ed Gruberman.

2393
03:07:45,323 --> 03:07:48,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Few novices experience so much of Taekwon Leap so soon.

2394
03:07:48,944 --> 03:07:49,004
[SPEAKER_15]: Ow!

2395
03:07:50,419 --> 03:07:51,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we continue.

2396
03:07:53,721 --> 03:07:55,962
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, hey, I wasn't ready.

2397
03:07:56,002 --> 03:07:57,642
[SPEAKER_18]: Come and get me now, shorty, huh?

2398
03:07:57,782 --> 03:07:59,163
[SPEAKER_18]: Come on, are you chicken?

2399
03:07:59,363 --> 03:07:59,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Boot to the head.

2400
03:08:01,384 --> 03:08:03,945
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, okay, now I'm ready.

2401
03:08:04,025 --> 03:08:06,046
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, now, come on, try it now.

2402
03:08:06,226 --> 03:08:06,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Boot to the head.

2403
03:08:08,547 --> 03:08:10,668
[SPEAKER_18]: Mind if I just lie down here for a minute?

2404
03:08:13,746 --> 03:08:18,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, class, we shall return to our... Master, it is wrong to tip the vessel of knowledge, student.

2405
03:08:19,087 --> 03:08:23,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Many apologies, master, but I feel Ed Gruberman is not wholly wrong.

2406
03:08:24,308 --> 03:08:24,968
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you mean?

2407
03:08:25,388 --> 03:08:26,928
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to boot some head, too.

2408
03:08:28,248 --> 03:08:30,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you learned nothing from the lesson of Ed Gruberman?

2409
03:08:30,849 --> 03:08:31,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, master.

2410
03:08:31,969 --> 03:08:33,209
[SPEAKER_07]: I have learned two things.

2411
03:08:33,809 --> 03:08:37,330
[SPEAKER_07]: First, that anger is a weapon only to one's opponent.

2412
03:08:37,390 --> 03:08:37,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

2413
03:08:38,170 --> 03:08:40,291
[SPEAKER_07]: And secondly, get in the first shot.

2414
03:08:40,651 --> 03:08:41,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Boot to the head.

2415
03:08:42,551 --> 03:08:43,011
[SPEAKER_07]: You missed.

2416
03:08:43,951 --> 03:08:44,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, yeah.

2417
03:08:44,652 --> 03:08:46,913
[SPEAKER_07]: You two shall be honored to learn a lesson about us.

2418
03:08:46,933 --> 03:08:47,914
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to, you know.

2419
03:08:48,515 --> 03:08:49,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Boot to the head.

2420
03:08:49,195 --> 03:08:50,736
[SPEAKER_15]: I gotta be going.

2421
03:08:52,318 --> 03:08:55,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Can anyone tell us what lesson has been learned here?

2422
03:08:55,440 --> 03:08:56,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, yes, master.

2423
03:08:56,721 --> 03:08:58,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a single one of us could defeat you.

2424
03:08:58,883 --> 03:09:00,424
[SPEAKER_07]: You gain wisdom, child.

2425
03:09:01,385 --> 03:09:02,445
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll have to gang up on you.

2426
03:09:02,465 --> 03:09:03,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Get him down!

2427
03:09:03,206 --> 03:09:04,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Boot to the head.

2428
03:09:04,607 --> 03:09:04,787
[SPEAKER_15]: Ah!

2429
03:09:11,096 --> 03:09:17,459
[SPEAKER_06]: And now, class, let us rejoin the mind to the body and gaze into the heart of the candle in meditation.

2430
03:09:22,241 --> 03:09:23,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Aum.

2431
03:09:23,901 --> 03:09:25,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good, class.

2432
03:09:41,567 --> 03:09:49,942
[SPEAKER_04]: People talking in movie shows, people smoking in bed People voting Republican, give them a boot to the head

2433
03:10:09,389 --> 03:10:17,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Botanics who can't fix a car Politicians who can't think The salesman who won't leave me alone The waiter who forgot my drink

2434
03:11:00,911 --> 03:11:04,427
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.

2435
03:11:22,383 --> 03:11:24,504
[SPEAKER_23]: God damn, that was a long fortune cookie message.

2436
03:11:24,524 --> 03:11:24,945
[SPEAKER_23]: That's alright.

2437
03:11:24,985 --> 03:11:28,687
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought I was just putting the song up, but I forgot that I had that as the whole thing.

2438
03:11:28,787 --> 03:11:37,072
[SPEAKER_23]: Our chatroom got a kick out of that, so we appreciate anything that can get the chatroom all happy and stuff, because the chatroom is really what keeps us going with this show.

2439
03:11:37,092 --> 03:11:38,273
[SPEAKER_10]: The chatroom needs happy pants.

2440
03:11:38,553 --> 03:11:39,114
[SPEAKER_10]: Kisses!

2441
03:11:39,554 --> 03:11:42,516
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, thanks you guys so much for tuning in and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

[SPEAKER_23]: We really appreciate it.

2443
03:11:43,336 --> 03:11:44,677
[SPEAKER_23]: I just broke my damn headphones.

2444
03:11:44,757 --> 03:11:45,638
[SPEAKER_23]: That's really great.

2445
03:11:46,619 --> 03:11:47,259
[SPEAKER_25]: Son of a bitch.

2446
03:11:47,860 --> 03:11:48,800
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.

2447
03:11:49,121 --> 03:11:52,163
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening tonight to Orange Lounge Radio.

[SPEAKER_23]: We hope to see you again next week and the week after and the week after that.

2449

[SPEAKER_23]: You're now going to get dumped from our stream, but please retune back into the station in about 15 seconds to resume.

2450
03:12:01,350 --> 03:12:03,312
[SPEAKER_22]: What?

2451
03:12:04,113 --> 03:12:04,593
[SPEAKER_22]: Continue.

2454
03:12:11,519 --> 03:12:11,979
[SPEAKER_23]: Have a good one.
