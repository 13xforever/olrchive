00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,320
co-hosts. In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Ms. Jamie Summers. You know her

00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,220
better as Dark Sakura.

44
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,420
Suicide girls suck!

45
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,980
OMG, I want to kill myself.

46
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,980
Watch me slip.

47
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,980
Who's got a razor?

48
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,540
I'm so emo, watch me slit my wrists and bleed my angst all over the world.

49
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:56,580
Does anyone actually self-declare themselves as emo?

50
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,600
Like, I hear a lot of-

51
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,780
No, cause that's not cool. I thought emo was like the hip thing to do right now, you know.

52
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:08,080
But I don't get it because everybody makes fun of emo people. I don't know anybody that's standing up for emo rights.

53
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,080
You know, I don't know anyone that's like saying, you know, I'm emo.

54
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,920
Yeah, but see, the things that you make fun of now are hip, like, next year.

55
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:19,920
So are you saying that, like, VH1 will do the I love the emo next year?

56
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,200
Yeah.

57
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:29,200
Remember kids, down the block, not across the street.

58
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,280
Wow, think about that one for a minute.

59
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,320
Alright, also joining us,

60
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,780
Tech Masa, Loki!

61
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,720
I love Pizza Hut.

62
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,620
It's becoming a tradition for you to come over and bring Pizza Hut every Sunday.

63
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,220
I could, well, twice is enough.

64
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,800
I could swear like every week you've been in this new studio you've brought over Pizza Hut.

65
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,320
I've only done twice!

66
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:58,180
The new studio, by the way, is right across the freeway from a Pizza Hut, Pizza Slut slash

67
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,180
Taco Bell place.

68
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,520
Yeah, it's more like Taco Bell with some pizza.

69
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,880
Yeah, it really is what it is.

70
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,880
Anyway, also joining us tonight, we have a very special guest.

71
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,760
We haven't had many guests in the new studio, so we're very pleased to welcome a staff member

72
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,800
of DDRFreak.com, say hello to Islander!

73
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,800
Hello!

74
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,800
One of the original DDRfreak.com members, if I'm not mistaken.

75
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Yeah, can you believe that? I'm over five years.

76
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,800
Shit, that's a long time!

77
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,800
I know, it's a very long time.

78
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:35,800
Oh, you know, before I forget, I need to give a shout-out to, ohmygoditsdoobs, because when I first saw that name, I thought it was, ohmygoditsboobs.

79
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,800
I want to know if that person stole the name from my live journal.

80
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,800
And so I was just like, wow.

81
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,800
And then I think somebody else changed her name to oh my god it's noobs, which I thought was kind of funny, too.

82
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,800
Oh my god it's something that rhymes with oobs tonight.

83
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,800
I have to say one more thing tonight, though.

84
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
Okay, what's that?

85
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,800
Happy birthday to Murdock!

86
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
Cause he's 39 and ancient.

87
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,800
But that's, in US time, that's actually tomorrow, right? 6-6 of 66?

88
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,800
It's June 6th in the UK, so happy birthday.

89
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,800
Um, isn't he a fictional character?

90
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,800
I can still say happy birthday.

91
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,800
Okie doke.

92
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,800
If Mickey Mouse could have a birthday.

93
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,800
Alright.

94
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,800
Alright, we'll be back after this with more Happy Skippy Orange Launch Radio.

95
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,800
If you want to join our chat room and, you know, hang out with OMG,

96
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,800
it's doobs and boobs and noobs and scoobs and whatever else they come up with.

97
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,800
Head on over to our website, www.orangelaunchradio.com

98
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:45,240
and click on chat. In this break, we're going to hear some music from Popin' Music Iroha,

99
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,400
also known as Popin' Music 12, because somebody wanted me to play this song last week and

100
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,000
I never got to it. I think it was Siggy or something. I don't even know if he's listening

101
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,840
right now, but I can't say I didn't honor that request. So, what are you giggling at

102
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:04,840
over there? You're giggling like a little girl. You actually found an animated graphic.

103
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,040
Oh somebody posted in the chat room somebody posted at the chat room that's

104
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,800
brilliant somebody posted a picture for those of you that aren't in a chair

105
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,420
somebody actually posted a picture of a hand showing the razor and it says

106
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:22,920
remember kids what is that a down the street down the road make it count down

107
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,920
the road not across the street I'm gonna have to find Sherlock's icon that's

108
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,880

It blows in.

112
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,360
You can't take that seriously

113
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,000
It blows in,

114
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,240
It blows in,

115
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,780
You can't take that seriously

116
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,360

You can't take that seriously

119
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,900
It blows in,

120
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,100
It blows in,

I look at you and say you're a bad boy

125
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:25,100
the

126
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,260
orange lounge radio

127
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,740
amani music

128
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,340
and more

129
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,300
we are back here on orange lounge

130
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:43,380
hi, whoops sorry, getting into a little third mix korean if i'm not careful there

131
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,240
we're back here on orange lounge radio

132
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,900
and that break uh... shizuku

133
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,660
uh... the new star mine remix

134
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:54,860
uh... the new kiriyama mocha song that was so key hyper rock and uh...

135
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,880
uh... viral kana all from

136
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,460
pop music you know how

137
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,640
or if you're lazy like me to say papa music twelve the technically it's

138
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,280
papa music you know

139
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,480
which some of us got to play we're at e three couple weeks ago and actually went

140
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,440
to a high

141
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,240
you got you check that out right i know i played and i got

142
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,440
i got screwed up because when you go into the game it's not like the old pop

143
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,120
Pop'n Musics, where you have the full song list and you can pick whatever you want, it

144
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,120
kind of starts you off in this dumbed-down mode, I think, more for kids.

145
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:28,080
Yeah, and you can't choose your speed modifiers and all this bullshit, so I got stuck in that

146
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,080
first.

147
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,080
Yeah, me too.

148
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,120
But I played all the Ani-Me music, and all the... and, uh, Goonies.

149
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,120
Yeah, that's cool.

150
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,120
Well, the Goonies was in Pop'n Musics 10, but...

151
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,120
I went ahead and played the drum line.

152
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,120
Did you?

153
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,120
I thought you hated that remix.

154
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,120
I do hate it, but I had to play it.

155
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,120
Oh, okay.

156
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,120
It was actually pretty fun and easy.

157
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,120
It was actually pretty fun and easy.

158
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,520
is a little scary to I think a lot of people

159
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,240
but I don't know to me it's cute I like it

160
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,960
I think more people should be into it. Hi

161
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,960
we're here on Orange Laundry to episode number 145

162
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,080
somebody in chat told me I said 140 in the opening

163
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,400
oops my bad it's actually 145 tonight. I thought I said

164
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,160
145 but somebody said I said 140.

165
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,180
145 tonight that means we're very close to 150 isn't that scary?

166
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:47,320
You know what else is this month? The three-year anniversary of this show.

167
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,600
Three years! Come along, let's have that Bart ride, huh?

168
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,020
Seriously, and this show is now old enough to attend preschool.

169
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,100
Yes. You know,

170
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:02,480
when I was three I had a good vocabulary. And I think that our vocabulary has

171
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,640
grown quite a bit from

172
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,960
shit-fuck-damn, you know.

173
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,060
Oh, I bet I still like my dick and fart jokes.

174
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:15,060
I still hate burping on the microphone.

175
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:19,060
It guarantees that the microphone stays in my possession.

176
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:23,060
And I don't think anybody that was listening to us episode 1

177
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:27,060
still listens, which is kind of sad.

178
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:31,060
Wasn't Dark Tetsuya there for episode 1? I think that's about it.

179
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:35,060
Wasn't he in the room for episode 1?

180
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:39,060
Yeah, Puppy needs to actually do his correspondent job.

181
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,060
So we do have a few people.

182
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,060
We have some of our old schoolers.

183
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:50,060
So we'll be having our three year anniversary special thingy sometime this month.

184
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:54,060
Don't know when yet because I could be out of town one of the weeks this month so we'll see.

185
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,060
Well that's poopy.

186
00:20:55,060 --> 00:21:01,060
Yeah I'm going to be going to LA this month and then actually in August I'm going to be going to the East Coast.

187
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,060
I actually have two trips to the East Coast plan right now which is really weird.

188
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,060
One for work and one for leisure.

189
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,660
One for work and one for leisure, because I planned the leisure one already.

190
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:14,700
I was going to go to the New York area around Labor Day, and now I'm going to be going to

191
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,740
Pennsylvania in August.

192
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,740
So that's kind of interesting.

193
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,740
I'm sorry.

194
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,420
Well, I heard about, you know, it's kind of empty.

195
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,540
There's not a whole lot there, but I heard about some, like, classic gaming store out

196
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,540
there.

197
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,500
Somebody had sent me a tip over email, so I'm really curious to check that out.

198
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:35,300
I just hope it doesn't suck, like, a certain classic video game store we have here in town.

199
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,340
Have you ever been there?

200
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:40,980
They're dead and they became Dan's store so I really wouldn't say anything about that

201
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,980
please.

202
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,980
Really?

203
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,980
Yes.

204
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,980
No, no, no.

205
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,180
There's still one that has that name.

206
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,300
It's gone.

207
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,300
All of them are gone.

208
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,300
They went out of business.

209
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,300
If it's anything, it's Leah's ex-husband.

210
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,300
Wow.

211
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,300
No.

212
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:58,300
I will give a short history on that one.

213
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:03,740
Leah, who was the ex-wife partner, went into business with Dan to keep the store alive

214
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:10,740
And so it became game on, and then she kind of screwed him out because she went to Pocket Lenny because she was dating a rich guy.

215
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,740
Uh-huh.

216
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,740
So, yeah.

217
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,740
But that, it's not the same one I'm thinking of, though.

218
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:20,740
It's because the one I, I went there like six months ago and it was still that old thing.

219
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,740
Same old logo and everything?

220
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,740
Yeah, same old logo and everything.

221
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,740
That's funny.

222
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,740
I'll have to point out where that is.

223
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,740
That's funny.

224
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,740
They're, they're not that hot, though.

225
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,740
I'm sorry.

226
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,740
Well, they weren't hot to begin with.

227
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,740
All right.

228
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,740
Anyway, sorry.

229
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,740
Hi, inside jokes.

230
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:37,300
Let's start off tonight's show with a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day?

231
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,820
Where we find out how your week was, as well as your day.

232
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,820
Start, Sakura.

233
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:47,260
My week was work, and of course having my day off, like all of us who work for a bank

234
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,260
did.

235
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:53,460
And I really didn't do a whole bunch of anything.

236
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,660
Played some PSO, of course.

237
00:22:55,660 --> 00:23:00,420
Played some Silent Hill, didn't get too far, so I'm actually at the same save point I was

238
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:09,500
that before. Um, played a lot of Puyo Puyo. Watched Dan beat Fire Emblem. Excuse me. Um,

239
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,340
tried to draw and really couldn't and then I started writing on, um, one of my fanfics

240
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:17,780
and it was just kind of a dull week. Oh yeah, I still haven't gotten the money for my car,

241
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:23,220
but that'll be coming up during the FUs of the week. That's really it.

242
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:26,220
How was your week? How was your day?

243
00:23:53,220 --> 00:24:10,220
You know, I've got to go back to Red Lobster at some point, because there's a waiter there, and I think he's gay, because he was giving us all this free food. It was me and two of my gay friends went over to Red Lobster. He started giving us, like, all this free food and didn't charge us for it. We didn't get charged for drinks. He brought us, like, double sides and stuff.

244
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,220
I want to go with you.

245
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:17,220
Islander's getting all kind of gay as he says, I want to go with you.

246
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:22,980
No, I swear, there's like this pink mafia out there and, you know, I'm going to expose

247
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,040
the secret here.

248
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,320
If you get the slightest inclination that somebody at a particular service industry

249
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:37,160
like, you know, at a store, at a restaurant might be, you know, gay, flirt with them.

250
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:41,700
Because you'll get a discount or something or you'll, or if they suspect that you're

251
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:46,220
at least like a gay rights supporter, you can get like breaks and stuff. It's really

252
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,380
weird. That means I need to go into Red Lobster wearing

253
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:54,380
a shirt that says HAG on it? Yeah. I'll tell you which waiter it is, too.

254
00:24:54,380 --> 00:25:00,740
Okay. I swear there's like a pink mafia out there.

255
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:05,560
I don't know about that. But anyways, other than that, really, nothing

256
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:10,800
has been going on. It's pretty much just been work stuff. I know we've got Sardella's people

257
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:15,700
coming out in the week of the 20th, which I think is a couple weeks away now. So they're

258
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:19,240
going to come out to which I guess I have to play them at some games or something, kick

259
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:27,340
their ass, just because that's, you know, standard company procedure. And then today

260
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:34,200
I went to Pizza Hut and I got two things of breadsticks and the pepperoni pizza, and I've

261
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,060
eaten half of that. I still have one thing of breadsticks left, which I'm debating about

262
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:44,620
keeping for later on because they're damn good fascinating really it is

263
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:50,060
fascinating then today I had to build a computer for my sister and I have all I

264
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:53,700
don't know where half of my motherboards went but I have a lot of crappy computer

265
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,840
parts so she's gonna get a computer that's about comparable with what we

266
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,260
used to run the show on and so the reason I say it's comparable is because

267
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:08,580
it's almost out of the same parts and really other than that there's not much

268
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:30,580
What did you think of the new one?

269
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,580
I have a complaint about that movie.

270
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,580
What's that?

271
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,580
I haven't seen it yet, so no spoilers.

272
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,580
General Grievous.

273
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:41,020
I heard how just kick-ass he was in the Clone Wars cartoon.

274
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:44,740
Yeah, he...

275
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:49,140
Damn it, it's hard for me to make my major complaint, or else I'll spill it for Rob.

276
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:53,340
That's okay. But it's just something about Obi-Wan riding a giant iguana.

277
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:57,380
Yeah, there was some iguana riding,

278
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:00,700
I don't know, it's weird. Yeah, it's weird. Interesting.

279
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:05,100
I'm supposed to see it Tuesday. Okay. Me and some of the Pink Mafia are going

280
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:10,100
Why aren't you listening to pump up the volume?

281
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:16,860
Maybe we'll get in free, I don't know, because I'm trying to revive my own show at some point,

282
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:21,820
so between that and karaoke I don't have a lot of free weeknights.

283
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,180
Don't make me, like, haunt you or something.

284
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,180
I'll TiVo it.

285
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:30,500
Speaking of haunting, we're supposed to be scheduling another trip out to some remote

286
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,660
cemetery that's uh... down by uh...

287
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,020
dry town in uh... sutter creek

288
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:39,620
and apparently it's on some guys land and we won't get bothered out there and

289
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,380
yeah what ever happened to the ghost hunting

290
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,100
uh... it's been on hiatus for a while just because

291
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:48,140
a uh... moving and everything and b just

292
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:52,180
we've been trying to get in contact with like local members of uh...

293
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,800
i forget the

294
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,380
there's an actual organization that people sign up for

295
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:00,300
which i really don't think there's a big deal behind it but it's just like

296
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,940
they have like standard protocol they take or something like that. So when you go ghost

297
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:07,880
hunting, is it like Luigi's Mansion? No, it's not like Luigi's Mansion. Did you take a vacuum

298
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:13,820
cleaner? No. Did you strap a vacuum cleaner on your back? It's not like that at all. It's

299
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:19,180
mainly, it's just kind of like surveying, basically just take readings of areas and

300
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:26,540
whatnot. The thing that I would probably be doing though that most normal people would

301
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:31,760
be doing is they usually don't try to disturb the area whereas I believe it's

302
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,300
like if you if you want like you know the rat to come out of the woodpile you

303
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:40,960
got to start shaking the woodpile for that to happen so same sense and you

304
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,720
know this if you want if you want something to happen you got to piss it

305
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:54,560
off so Mario anyways but no that's it's no supposedly we're just gonna go chill

306
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,920
down there we were gonna do an all-nighter thing but uh my fiance didn't

307
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:02,260
like that idea so um instead we're gonna go down there at dusk and hang out

308
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:06,440
during the night for a little bit she goes ghost hunting in Alabama because we

309
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,940
actually have old cemeteries well this is an old cemetery too these are from

310
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:19,040
like the 1700s and 1600s I don't talk to old people so fun no anyways I don't

311
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:24,540
have a picture of a ghost yeah but you know everyone has a picture of Michael

312
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:30,540
So it's okay. Anyways, that's all. I'm done.

313
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:34,540
Islander, how was your week and how was your day?

314
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:41,540
My week started off at Fanime, actually. A big anime convention down in the Bay Area.

315
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:50,540
And I woke up, unfortunately, with a hangover. Too many tequila shots, not a good thing.

316
00:29:50,540 --> 00:30:00,540
And either my roommate or someone down there got me sick, so the entire week I've been fighting a cold, I'm pretty much getting over it at this point.

317
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:07,540
Today, I was in the mood for Pump It Up, another dance simulation game.

318
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:12,540
Pump It Up? Really? I've never heard of it. I'm just kidding. For those of you who don't know.

319
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:15,540
I think most of our listeners know Pump It Up. I hope you do.

320
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,540
If you don't, Korean five panels.

321
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,540
Yeah, that's it. That's all I need to know.

322
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,540
So I had to drive all the way down to Florin Mall.

323
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,540
They still have Pump It Up there?

324
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:26,540
They still have Pump It Up there, and they have a Dance Freaks.

325
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,540
OMG!

326
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,540
Yes, the Korean version of Dance Mania X.

327
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,540
OMG, I have to go play this.

328
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,540
Do they have different songs in it?

329
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:37,540
It's basically DMX1 with a few K-Pop songs thrown in.

330
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,540
Are any decent K-Pop songs?

331
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:42,540
Um, there's a few good ones.

332
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,540
Is Starion in it?

333
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,540
No, unfortunately, Caution is not in it.

334
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,540
How about Starion? It's in every other K-Pop song.

335
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,540
Is Starion in it, really?

336
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:53,540
Sorry I'm not in it, but there is a Bae G. Young song called Dash. There is a few songs...

337
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,540
Oh, Dash and... Dash and...

338
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,540
I knew it was in another game.

339
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,540
Oh, that's not bad.

340
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:06,540
There's a few other K-Pop groups that I recognize, like Seshki's, Klon, whatever.

341
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:10,540
But yeah, I went down there for Pump It Up, of all things.

342
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:13,540
And you're shaking your head in disgust, though, as you say that.

343
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:31,540
Because for a couple days I've been itching to play because my good friend Floatwalk, Mel B, linked me to this site for PIU that had just a bunch of old videos, not freestyle or routine videos, but actual music videos for a lot of those songs.

344
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:36,540
And I was like, oh my gosh. And all of a sudden I had this inkling to go play all of a sudden.

345
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,540
Have you ever seen a video for Baquah?

346
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,540
Yes.

347
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,540
Doesn't it suck?

348
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,540
Yeah, because she turns into a mermaid

349
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:48,680
Yeah, I like was watching it going what the hell I was expecting because the quads such a kind of like

350
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,460
I don't know it strikes me as a very angsty kind of song

351
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:57,780
Mm-hmm, and I was just been here like be kicking some ass or something not frickin sitting on the rock being the little mermaid. Yeah

352
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,380
exactly, I

353
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:05,740
Was expecting her little crab friend and fish flounder to pop up and start singing along, you know

354
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:20,980
I'm actually trying to read up on what's going on with that Pump It Up tourney.

355
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:25,040
I know there was one a couple weeks ago in Dallas, Texas that was going on.

356
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:29,140
It was one of those qualifiers for the big Pump It Up tournament in Korea, but I haven't

357
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:33,860
heard anything else about future qualifiers since then.

358
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:36,860
I'd be really mad if that's the only, like, qualifying training in the United States.

359
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:42,860
That would suck, but there's got to be one that happens in the Bay at some point.

360
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:48,860
Because, you know, Dallas is, you know, right in the middle for this big country for everyone to go to.

361
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,860
I was looking over on Mastiff's site to see if they have anything on it,

362
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:57,860
and they are still plugging a Smidget being at the Metreon on February 11th.

363
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,860
Which, by the way, I didn't even know the Metreon had Pump It Up.

364
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:05,900
I don't think they do, so they must have wheeled in a machine for that, unless they replaced

365
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,900
one of their other machines.

366
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,900
I'm not sure.

367
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,380
Now I'm trying to check out a Marrow site and see if they have anything going on.

368
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:17,980
And I don't see anything, but I'll keep looking.

369
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,300
Maybe somebody in our chat room knows.

370
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,140
If anybody in our chat room knows, feel free to share.

371
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:24,740
We'll read it on air and try to get what's going on with that tournament, because I'm

372
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:28,100
sure a lot of people that aren't just in Texas want to qualify what's going on

373
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:33,980
there so um let's see my week in my day but may I be the first to say that I

374
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:37,220
missed having three-day weekends the golf club was a lot of fun last Sunday

375
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:43,340
actually I don't want to go again like I could tonight but not me now at work and

376
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:47,120
everything but well I've worked tomorrow but I'd be there till 9 that's the

377
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:52,420
spirit um the golf club was actually quite a bit of fun I was I was wearing

378
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:55,780
one of the brightest shirts there. I was wearing my shirts... He could see you from across the

379
00:33:55,780 --> 00:34:00,340
room. I was wearing... See, because most people at the goth club wear all black. Or sometimes,

380
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:05,700
like the gothy goths wear white because, you know, they're going to be different. I wore a

381
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:11,060
bright ass red shirt because it was my engrish.com shirt and it said I hate myself and I want to die

382
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:14,980
because I thought that would be appropriate for the goth club with little rainbows and hearts.

383
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:20,900
It looks like a box of lucky charms. So we had a good time. What else did I do this week? Not a

384
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:25,820
whole lot I saw the movie crash I think on was that Memorial Day that I saw

385
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:29,620
that or maybe it was last Sunday I don't know I don't know but I am to you after

386
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:34,860
I just got done watching Team America World Police I'm so ornery and you were

387
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:40,340
watching a South Park movie yeah no I went I went saw crash I think that was

388
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:47,700
on Monday which was good it's just very unapologetic and in-your-face type thing

389
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:53,300
where some of the language is very raw. It's a movie that deals with racism so

390
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:58,420
if the n-word makes you uncomfortable or any of the other various racial slurs

391
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:02,260
Loki you'd have no problem with this movie if any of those various racial

392
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:06,340
slurs make you uncomfortable but I don't actually was a really good movie it was

393
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:11,140
really good really well done so I recommend it otherwise not a whole lot

394
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:18,700
going on I went out to play in the groove actually twice this week I just

395
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:24,700
well you know what I'm loving the USB support thing because one reason I like

396
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:29,220
the way in the groove has its workout mode set up is that you don't have to do

397
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:33,020
like a special mode to have it count your calories it actually counts your

398
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:36,420
calories while you're playing a normal game this kind of bugs me about DDR I

399
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:40,580
don't know why it's such a little-ass problem but I wish that and I think the

400
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:44,840
only game that ever did this was Disney's rave funny enough that Disney's

401
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:48,420
rave is the only DDR game that did a lot of things correctly let's say dance

402
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:53,180
magic and then it counts your calories no matter what mode you're playing in

403
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:57,140
the reason why I don't like workout mode in like PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions

404
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:02,580
is that if you play a workout mode you don't unlock new songs you don't

405
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:08,140
technically save your grades or your scores or anything so there's no point

406
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:11,580
and playing in workout mode unless you are strictly there to burn calories. But I like

407
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:14,620
to unlock songs as I play DDR. I don't know about the rest of you, but that's part of

408
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:20,260
the fun of it, so. Anyway, so In the Groove has the fantastic USB support. Say what you

409
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:26,260
will about the game, but the USB support is fantastic, so I've been having fun with that.

410
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:31,300
The game itself, eh, it's just kind of holding me over until there's a new DDR, which, I

411
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:34,620
don't know, I'm not going to hold my breath at this point, but maybe some home versions

412
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,640
this fall. I don't know, we'll see. Well, we know there's whole versions, but you know.

413
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:48,000
I want new arcade stuff. Really bad. Okay. Moving on. Let's see what's going on in the

414
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,640
Bamani world news-wise. I thought we had a...

415
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:56,020
I know two things. What's that? Jack and... No, I'm kidding.

416
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:59,780
It's really a slow... If video gaming and all together is kind of a slow news period

417
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,600
right now, it's kind of sad. It's on vacation after E3.

418
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,600
Yeah, it really is.

419
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,600
Checking some of the headlines recently over on TedDDRFreak, which by the way,

420
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,600
replays our show on Friday nights.

421
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,600
Those lovely folks over there.

422
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,600
Yes.

423
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:20,600
They actually had like a legal perspective, explain the Konami vs. Rockstar thing,

424
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,600
which if you were totally confused by the lawsuit, I would hope that if you

425
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,600
listened to our program a couple weeks ago when that subject first came up,

426
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,600
that we helped explain things for you.

427
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:34,880
you're still lost they kind of had somebody that is in law school or

428
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,520
recently finished with law school try to kind of explain it a little more so it's

429
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,840
it's a fun read so check that out also very interesting that's brought up in

430
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:48,240
there is that rock source supposed to have like 20 days to do a response to

431
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,320
the lawsuit so it'll be interesting because sometime this week even though

432
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,440
it's been over 20 days it might be 20 business days I don't know how it works

433
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:01,200
But, somebody, we're thinking this week we might get some more information on exactly

434
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:07,220
what Roxor's comment is going to be to that. Or, as I predict, the out-of-court settlement

435
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:11,480
will happen very soon. But we'll see.

436
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:16,160
And then of course there were some new trailers posted over on IGN.com for DDR Extreme 2 and

437
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:21,400
UltraMix 3, which really don't show anything new as far as I remember from looking at the

438
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,240
trailers. There's really nothing new in it. And then the BeatMania trailer is available

439
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:29,800
of our games are fun, but it's the same damn thing they showed at E3.

440
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,080
Exactly the same thing.

441
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,920
Really not a lot new.

442
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:38,320
New news possibly on Xtreme 2 at Comic Con, if it's going to be anything like last year.

443
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,120
You remember last year at Comic Con in July in San Diego, they actually brought a build

444
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:47,880
of Xtreme, last year it was Xtreme, and we found out some new songs that way.

445
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,360
So we're hoping that this year they'll do the same thing, and we'll find out some new

446
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,520
stuff for Xtreme 2.

447
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,520
We shall see.

448
00:38:54,520 --> 00:39:01,460
will be very interesting. Anyway, I think what we'll do right now is we'll take a quick

449
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:06,960
break and then we'll come back and... I get to break stuff, yay! We'll talk about your

450
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,320
news when we come back, Loki, don't worry. And then we'll also get into tonight's cage

451
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:17,360
match very soon as well as your calls via the Skype line, www.orangelaungeradio.com.

452
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,820
By the way, we're looking into this new thing we might do. I actually, this is the first

453
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:24,360
time I have even said this to the others because Jason brought this to my

454
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,560
attention just like two days ago but there's actually this new thing called

455
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:33,640
Skype in where we could get a phone number and then if somebody calls the

456
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:38,160
phone number it'll come in on Skype so we'll probably be looking into that so

457
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,740
possibly in the very near future orange launch radio for those of you that don't

458
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:44,820
get the Skype thing or don't want it we will have a phone number that you can

459
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:49,500
call to be on the program so that will be a very cool addition we'll see all

460
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:53,500
Alright, anyway. After this break, we'll be back with more Orange Launch Radio.

461
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,500
And this break, music from 2DX Night Style.

462
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:01,500
Started off with a popular song from 2DX Night Style, but we haven't played it in a while, so...

463
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:08,500
I thought you kids would enjoy this. Lion Ski!

464
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:41,380
I cannot lie, I'm a killer, I am a sick and guy

465
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:55,700
I cannot lie, I'm a killer, I am a sick and guy

466
00:41:55,700 --> 00:42:00,700
I am the same picky guy

467
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,700
Let's go!

468
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,700
Let's go!

469
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:59,700
Let's go!

470
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,700
Oh

471
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:56,100
And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's

472
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:59,260
favourite perverse Bomani band, E-rotic.

473
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:01,820
Do it all night. Do it with me.

474
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:04,460
No, no, that was awful, bloody terrible.

475
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:07,100
Do you take vocal lessons? Kill your teacher!

476
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,620
In the heat of the night.

477
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:11,220
Oh, God, I think my ears are bleeding.

478
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,220
I liked it.

479
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:15,820
Shut the bloody hell up, Paula. Next.

480
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:18,300
Oh...

481
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:21,060
That was cool.

482
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:23,180
Do you even know why you're here?

483
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:25,620
That was just bloody pathetic. Next.

484
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:32,620
Yes, yes, that's it! We have a winner! A Star is Born, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

485
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:46,300
God, that promo's old. I thought with the whole American Idol stuff, it's not even that

486
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:52,240
good compared to some of our other promos, but I thought with the whole American Idol

487
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:57,200
thing going on this past couple weeks that, you know, that it was time to play that again.

488
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,800
So congratulations to Carrie Underwood, your erotic pop idol, who I'm sure will be a playboy

489
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,760
in a matter of years, because that's where most of those pop idols are headed.

490
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,560
I haven't even followed it since Carrie.

491
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,560
Carrie Underwood is useless.

492
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,480
I can sing country music, but can you sing pop music?

493
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:14,880
I can sing country music, but can you sing pop music?

494
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:15,880
Country music?

495
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:16,880
No, pop music!

496
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:17,880
Pop!

497
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,400
That's all she could do.

498
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,960
Every song she sang was a country song.

499
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:26,920
so going to be on the surreal life in two years. I haven't followed it since I bought

500
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:32,920
Clay's album. I did buy Clay's album and I was proud of it because he has a good voice.

501
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:41,920
But he has a really good voice. What happened to Clay Aiken? I don't know but he's pretty.

502
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:48,600
He's invisible. We don't know what happened to him. You have to understand what happened

503
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:53,400
was, is there was a rival between Ruben and Clay.

504
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:58,360
Biggie, Ruben, and Clay, you see, and they gunned him down.

505
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:01,720
Oh, I figured that Ruben just ate Clay.

506
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:05,360
Actually, Ruben was having, I think,

507
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:08,280
to visit a nutritionist because he was going,

508
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,280
he was saying he was comfortable in his own body,

509
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,400
but he's actually starting to develop heart issues

510
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,200
and things last I checked.

511
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,280
We saw people going to die?

512
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:23,280
He's the people who's going to, I don't know, but there's been a big health concern regarding

513
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,280
the fact that he's basically put on a hundred pounds since he won.

514
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,280
No, it's too bad.

515
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,280
Dang!

516
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,280
A hundred more?

517
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,280
So I've heard.

518
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,820
He needs to start playing some DDR.

519
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:37,840
The bigger I am, the bigger I am on the charts.

520
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:41,120
That's just, but he, I know that he's gained a lot of weight since then.

521
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,600
Look at the comparison pictures.

522
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,520
He's a big boy now.

523
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:52,400
Wow, who was that rap artist like way back in the day, you know, that used to be like heavy D. Yeah heavy D

524
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:55,020
Dude heavy D was cool

525
00:50:55,720 --> 00:51:00,000
Dude Biz Markie with me and the boys Biz Markie was on that a vh1

526
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:05,360
Get fit show celebrity fit club. I love Biz Markie and the Snapple lady

527
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:11,400
She was on that too. Yes, she was as well as me a Tyler who else anyway

528
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:16,280
This is what happens when there's not a lot of DDR. We start talking about VH1 shows.

529
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,960
By the way, Surreal Life 5 is going to rock.

530
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,000
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I saw...

531
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,920
Who's this time around?

532
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:23,920
Did you know...

533
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,320
Bronson Pinchot from Perfect Strangers, Balki.

534
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,320
Yes.

535
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:31,480
In the same house with Omarosa from The Apprentice and Janice Dickinson from America's Next Top

536
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:36,800
Model. Which, by the way, if America's Next Top Model is not your guilty pleasure show,

537
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,440
it should be. Because that show... What a bunch of bitches!

538
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,440
Seriously.

539
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:47,500
Nelly was watching this one show yesterday on VH1, I guess it's called Strip Search.

540
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,640
I'm surprised, Rob, you haven't heard of this.

541
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:53,560
Actually, my roommate watches Strip Search every week.

542
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:56,160
Okay, I was like, this is weird.

543
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,520
He's probably watching it right now.

544
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:02,560
I was overhearing it while I was uploading my MySpace site, which I'll have to cover

545
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,560
later.

546
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:09,160
And so, it's just like, I guess they make these guys do their strip dances in the middle

547
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:12,880
like where they're working or whatever and i think that they can go and compete

548
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,520
to become like the next uh... sundown down under yes

549
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,800
center from down under shell

550
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,560
but uh...

551
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:23,800
yeah i got thunder down under it's called my fat thighs

552
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,640
i don't know about you

553
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,840
uh...

554
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:31,400
the holy title vote for a clap them together by make a thunderous noise i

555
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,140
don't know

556
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:32,920
anyway

557
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:36,640
the holy time of work and i don't know and i don't know

558
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:40,920
American Idol. I think I made Islander just throw up in his mouth a little bit, though.

559
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:44,880
American Idol. Well, since we were talking about American Idol, have you seen the

560
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,380
previews for that show, Do You Think You Can Dance?

561
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:53,400
No. Is that the dance show on ABC? That's the dance show that's going to be on Fox.

562
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:57,880
Fucking all these reality shows. It's going to be, imagine American Idol except

563
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,820
dancing.

564
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:01,180
I should go on that show.

565
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:02,760
Including the people that can't dance.

566
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,720
No, you know what show actually I should go on?

567
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,480
Beauty and the Geek.

568
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,400
i thought i would only think this show is up no seriously for the previews i

569
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,180
thought the show is going to be a big pile of trash

570
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:16,280
it actually was a really cute show

571
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:19,760
i thought i don't know about you know it's uh...

572
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,920
it's all these like a really nerdy guys when i thought they were going to be

573
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:26,560
like more nerdy of the bill gates look at the three-year-old yeah like the

574
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:29,700
three doors that they've been a few days

575
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:32,160
and uh... that you've been to the

576
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,760
they put up against like playboy models

577
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:38,480
But the thing is, is that then they go in competitions.

578
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,800
And they pair off, and they have to do competitions.

579
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,940
So the geeks have to teach the models how to spell.

580
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:48,000
And then the models have to teach the geeks how to dance

581
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,560
and how to do social things.

582
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,360
So actually, in the first episode,

583
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,140
they had a dance competition for the geeks.

584
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:57,240
And the models were in, what, a fifth grade spelling bee?

585
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:58,560
Or what were they doing?

586
00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:59,320
Yeah.

587
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,680
That has to be hilarious.

588
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,840
It was so great, because the one girl was like, tattoo.

589
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:11,440
T-A-T-O-O, she got all excited because she won, and then they're like, no, it's not like

590
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:12,440
that.

591
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:19,360
But it was really, like, the way they do it, they do it without it being demeaning, I think.

592
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,320
Like it's poking fun without being malicious.

593
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:26,500
And like, a shot like that would be followed up immediately with the girl who actually

594
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,500
wins it.

595
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:31,700
She's going, I feel so great right now because I've never won an intelligence competition

596
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:38,700
in my entire life until today.

597
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,700
Is it Wannabamani?

598
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,700
Wannabamani? I guess?

599
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:09,700
Anyways, let me see here.

600
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:14,700
Basically, I decided, you know, it's been a while since we heard something about those other games that are out there,

601
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:20,700
so I figured I'd go take a peek and see what's actually being worked on.

602
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:23,700
So, Neon FM is where all the news is right now.

603
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:29,140
now apparently they've had a kind of an invitation only you know debuting of

604
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:32,820
their machine and stuff which looks pretty cool and considering it's all

605
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:38,940
being done by scratch it's pretty awesome and what they've got so far it

606
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:45,500
will basically you've got something that looks kind of similar to DVR not really

607
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:51,060
it's basically you've got five panels on each side a range kind of like a normal

608
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:57,060
beat mania controller, you know, back in the five key days, without the turntable.

609
00:55:57,060 --> 00:56:00,060
Well, yeah, obviously without the turntable. That'd be a little weird if it had...

610
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:03,060
But that would be fun! Ice skating revolution!

611
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:11,060
Exactly. So basically, we've got those, and it's basically, they were showing some of the screenshots

612
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:16,060
and more of the gameplay, and they basically, they, I guess, debuted this at Betzen.

613
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:19,960
for those who don't know, Betzen is an arcade parts

614
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:23,820
supplier and they're the ones actually building the machines for

615
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:27,780
the NFM and they actually debuted it I guess at one of their

616
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:28,980
warehouses there

617
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:34,180
so that's kind of interesting to see. Some more interesting stuff that's happening right now

618
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:38,740
I guess Thomas Howard, the same Thomas Howard that may be featured in

619
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:43,780
La Senorita and all that stuff. He's actually going to... Captain T!

620
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:49,780
Captain T. Yes, he's actually going to Japan right now to film a live performance with

621
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:52,940
the other artist that sings Girls Butts.

622
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:56,220
And they're doing the live video that's going to be in the background for that song right

623
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:57,220
now.

624
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:01,420
Oh god, this is, Girls Butts is going to be the reason to play.

625
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:09,800
And honestly, what else, oh, they've got, there's, what else, damn, where did my clip

626
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,800
of Girls Butts go?

627
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:12,800
I used to have it.

628
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:16,000
Don't worry about it, we'll be able to get you some clips in a little bit.

629
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,280
I'm going to download this other thing.

630
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:21,880
It's basically 20 second samples of a bunch of different songs.

631
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:26,520
But we actually have some of the full length songs, not obviously the same cut that's going

632
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:32,640
to be in the game, but from Poppin Co., which is one of the artists that does the music

633
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:33,680
in the game.

634
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,960
And it's some pretty interesting generic stuff right now.

635
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,080
Are we going to play clips from these songs here?

636
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,880
I suppose we should just play clips, yeah.

637
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,360
Let's just play clips, because these are kind of long.

638
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:46,960
So here's a clip of all these songs in the game, because there's two songs here called

639
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:47,960
Complete Shot.

640
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:52,480
Uh, Complete Shot, I think the Greek fire mix is not in the game, but the other one

641
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,480
is.

642
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:57,400
Then let's play a clip here of the club blend mix of Complete Shot.

643
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,400
Here it is.

644
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:05,400
neon FM.

645
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:18,600
Is this like their version of Max 300 or what is this?

646
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:21,000
No, I think it's probably just

647
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:26,240
more stuff to it. You know, it's because it's a long version of the song.

648
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:53,520
p0k3smot42o

649
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,520
Not too shabby. Not too shabby.

650
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,520
Better sound than in the groove.

651
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,520
Well, they're different. I don't know. It's hard to say.

652
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:03,520
Alright, here's a clip of the other song. This is Electro 8.

653
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,520
Yeah, enjoy this one.

654
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:44,520
It's okay. It sounds like an old Game Boy game or something. I don't know. It's kind

655
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,520
of weird.

656
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,520
Exactly.

657
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:47,520
Okay.

658
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:52,600
Now, you can find those songs that we just played on popnko.com. That's P-O-P-N-K-O.com.

659
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:59,160
And they actually have screenshots from the May 13th prototype party where they had it

660
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:02,880
at Betzen and you can actually see pictures of the cabinet and actually if

661
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:08,520
you go to neonfm.com you can check out they have more screens or actual shots

662
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:12,560
of the cabinet that you can see the actual buttons and stuff and it looks

663
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:15,360
pretty cool actually so far and they've done a pretty good job with the game I

664
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:19,320
believe I wish they just call it feet mania because that would be because it

665
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:24,000
looks it looks really cool from what they've got so far I mean it just makes

666
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:31,360
It makes me think, though, of stepping selection, and I have bad, bad, traumatized memories

667
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,640
of stepping selection.

668
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:33,640
You know what?

669
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:38,360
I'm actually excited about Neon FM.

670
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:43,000
I think they're doing a lot of things right, and sadly, I think the reason why they're

671
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,000
doing a lot of things right is because they've been able to learn from everything In The

672
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,200
Groove did wrong.

673
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:50,640
And here's the other thing, too, which is going to be before everyone starts going,

674
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:54,760
Well, they're actually working with Konami of America throughout the entire process of

675
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:55,760
developing this game.

676
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:59,120
That's what I think is, like, really kind of weird in a way.

677
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:03,000
Not really, I mean, because it's not bad, it's just weird.

678
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,680
It makes sense because they're getting feedback from them, what they think, and also they're

679
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:10,780
making sure that all their bases are covered, like, you know, hey, is there anything we're

680
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:15,560
infringing on that we need to be copyright, you know, paying you for, you know, licensing

681
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,840
and stuff, and they're taking care of all that.

682
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:21,120
you should be giving us fifty million dollars

683
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:24,240
but i honestly i don't think this is going to be much of a problem compared

684
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,060
to like say you know

685
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:29,560
in the group which looked exactly like the year this is at least

686
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:33,360
doesn't get the reasonable the new cabinet new dance pad they've kind of

687
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:36,440
real even in the screens it doesn't look anything like the year because the way

688
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:40,080
they've rearranged things so it's yet very different

689
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:43,160
that's why i i get i give the game a lot of credit and

690
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:46,040
i hope it catches on enough so that we see this in

691
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:50,840
Honestly, I just am glad to see something that's, you know, different than, say, you

692
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:55,560
know, DDR or Pump It Up, you know, something that'll be, you know, a little different.

693
01:01:55,560 --> 01:02:01,440
Also, if you, ooh, good comment from our chat room. Ron Chan says, maybe the FM in Neon

694
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:07,040
FM stands for Feet Mania. I like that. So, Neon Feet Mania.

695
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:08,040
We have a genius.

696
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:13,080
And here's another thing, also, in case you're interested. There's a link on Neon FM's site

697
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:18,180
here where you can actually download ringtones for your cell phone, one of them being Girl's

698
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:19,180
Butts.

699
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:20,180
Yes!

700
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:21,180
Fun.

701
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:24,520
Dude, I'm so downloading that for my, does it support Sprint or do we know?

702
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:30,720
Um, well they have a picture here, it shows M-Mode, so, M-Mode would be, I believe, um,

703
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:31,720
the AT&T.

704
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:32,720
That's not Sprint.

705
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:33,720
Sprint is...

706
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:36,600
But, it's just, they're MIDI files, I mean, come on, I mean, any phone should be able

707
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:37,600
to download that.

708
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,600
That's awesome.

709
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:39,600
So that's your...

710
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,700
I can't find my clip of Girl's Butts.

711
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:46,700
I'm downloading. I have a thing downloading right now, which I will actually give to you if you give me my flash drive back.

712
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:47,700
Thank you. I will.

713
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:55,700
That's a 20 second clip of about 13 to 20 different songs, and you'll be able to hear a lot more of what's going to be in there right now.

714
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:59,700
So I guess I'll throw it on here, and we'll play it later.

715
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:01,700
Okay. We can do that.

716
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:05,700
Sounds good. So we'll play that later. More Neon FM.

717
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:09,700
Any idea when they're going to release this? Any word of a release date yet?

718
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:10,700
Not yet.

719
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:14,560
talk to somebody over on the team over there and try to get somebody on this show to give

720
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:21,560
us details. Okay. And I also want girls' butts dedicated to me.

721
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:29,200
I was going to say some other stuff non-related. I have a MySpace site, another one now that

722
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:38,360
I've been plugging in our live journal community, actually. It's MySpace.com slash Lowkey Fusion.

723
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:43,120
you can actually listen to brand new songs on there as they come out and I

724
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:46,440
don't upload them to my really shitty site and it plus I have a really cool

725
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:55,320
logo that you know looks just like the DR Ultramix 3 logo so it's spiffy um so

726
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:59,680
go check it out befriend me do all that wonderful stuff um also if you placed at

727
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:06,000
mania someone actually made a sim file for what was it uh the legend of trans

728
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
That was 2005, so go check that out in Bomani style.

729
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,000
That's a few pages back in there, sim file section there.

730
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Which technically would count as another max sim file.

731
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Good job, guys.

732
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:24,000
The background art, though, kind of sucks.

733
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Anyways.

734
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:30,000
And then, other than that, really not too much else going on.

735
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I think I found it.

736
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
I think I found it.

737
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Oh, god.

738
01:04:33,000 --> 01:05:02,760
I have no idea, I think this is it, YES!

739
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:24,360
This is right here the song of the game.

740
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:30,800
How can you not be excited about Neon Feet Mania after hearing that?

741
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:35,720
Now, that's not the same mix, though, because that doesn't sound like Thomas Howard.

742
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:38,240
That sounds like DJ Potato singing that.

743
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:39,240
Or is it?

744
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:40,240
Am I wrong?

745
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,240
I have no idea.

746
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,240
I think that's DJ Potato actually singing that.

747
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:46,880
It might be DJ Potato singing, but the new one, I mean, I've gotta say that they're doing

748
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:52,360
quite a bit, I mean, they're putting quite a lot of polish in this game, I mean, getting

749
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:55,880
a live performance of Thomas Howard in Japan with the other artist, and apparently there's

750
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:59,680
a female artist that does vocals on that song as well, so.

751
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:05,680
I want, like, really, like, 80s porn, like, close-up shots of her butt in, like, tight clothing and stuff.

752
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:08,680
It has to be porn style. It has to be.

753
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:10,680
Even Dark Sakura is into me.

754
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:12,680
Oh my God. Picture this.

755
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:14,680
He's gotta be all pimped out with a hat.

756
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:22,680
This woman throws at me every time I even mention they should objectify women in one form or another, and she agrees with me on this one.

757
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:29,680
This song! This song has to have it and the guy has to be all pimped out, but then the girl has to turn around and shoot him.

758
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:39,680
I've got, you know, your video right here. You need to have, like, a really quick close-up shot of a door opening, and Thomas Howard singing this song is the pizza guy.

759
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:43,680
That would be fucking awesome.

760
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,680
I still think the girl needs to go around and shoot.

761
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:50,680
They should parody a bunch of different porno videos.

762
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:52,680
The temps should be a girl.

763
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:25,680
That could be, that should be the marketing for the game. They should have that printed on bumper stickers.

764
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,680
Featuring girls' butts.

765
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:34,680
It should just be neon, neon FM and really tiny print in the corner. Neon FM featuring girls' butts with a Z.

766
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:39,680
That song, awesome. That song needs to go on the radio.

767
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:45,680
Maybe we should have like a, maybe we should help them out. You know, we've got some artistic people on staff here.

768
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:50,560
let's make some neon FM promo banners and we'll do that little neon FM

769
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:55,560
featuring girls butts like really really huge and then have the 80s porn but I

770
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:59,360
think we should do that yeah we'll do it as a favor to neon FM and then maybe

771
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:03,720
some of them will come on the show and talk about their game I like this idea

772
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:12,000
it has merit I think we'll go to a quick break when we come back we are gonna

773
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:18,720
take your calls over on the skype line www.orangelaunchradio.com click on interact with us and we'll get

774
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:24,200
into the cage match as well and maybe if we have time tonight uh we'll do like what do

775
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:27,840
you think listless tonight why not we haven't done that in a while we haven't done listless

776
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:32,300
in a while we have got sufficient people we have to think of a topic though so we'll we'll

777
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:38,540
think about that ways to promote neon fm actually that might not be a bad idea that might not

778
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:42,700
be a bad idea. So I have a feeling that if we do that, we will be taking an inside joke

779
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:47,940
or a joke that was five minutes ago and just be ramming it into the ground.

780
01:08:47,940 --> 01:08:53,260
That's okay. Alright, we'll see. Okay, in this break, I thought maybe what we could

781
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:58,660
do is actually place In the Groove's music this break because we've kind of been mean

782
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:02,660
to them this break. Has In the Groove come out yet? Because apparently, and this is interesting,

783
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:06,540
apparently someone I know at work, they're like, you know, I'm looking for a DDR game

784
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:11,280
that has some Britney Spears songs in it because my, my daughter, okay, daughter's

785
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:16,080
ten-year-old, okay, now she's into the Britney Spears Christina Aguilera crap, they're looking

786
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:20,340
for a song that had some of that stuff, so I'm loaning her DDR Extreme Max 2. In return,

787
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:25,480
she's loaning me In the Groove. For the home console. Apparently, she already has it. She

788
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:31,000
says that's what it is. She says it looks exactly like DDR, except it does, you know,

789
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,640
I showed her pictures of In the Groove and she's like, I'm almost positive that's what

790
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:39,960
it is so I get to see whatever if it is that's very odd because I don't I

791
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:43,400
haven't heard of it coming out yet and that you would be all over if it had

792
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:46,880
come out I will see let me check let me check in fact let me just make sure I

793
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:51,840
haven't missed something okay it g freak dot-com because this site would have it

794
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:57,000
right yeah let's see that that that uh nope no news on the home version coming

795
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:03,360
out your co-workers insane or is gotten some some huge break somehow I don't

796
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:12,360
I don't know what she has, but I bet you anything that's MC Groove's dance craze or something like that, that's probably what you're going to get in return, that MC Groove.

797
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:16,360
Either way, we'll have a review of whatever the hell it is that she has.

798
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:20,360
Some subpar game.

799
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:25,360
What am I looking for in this room?

800
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:29,360
The girls' bus thing just totally inspired me to open a restaurant.

801
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:30,360
Called what?

802
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:36,320
Well, you know, this objectifying women thing is pretty stupid. I think that men should be objectified.

803
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,600
So I'm opening a restaurant called Heckers.

804
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:41,440
Hey, there's no problem with that. Or Bananas.

805
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:46,960
It was in a commercial a while ago, I think. But it's a chicken restaurant like Hooters, so it's gonna be Heckers.

806
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:51,800
Alright, well, I thought about the cool pool hall called, you know, Great Rack.

807
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:54,780
You can have that.

808
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:57,640
That's horrible. Or, uh, Jail Bait.

809
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:04,800
That'd be another song or another another restaurant where the theme would be you know women in like the schoolgirl outfits

810
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:07,040
You know hot Asian women jailbait

811
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:09,840
raisins

812
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:13,960
No, hot Asian women in schoolgirl outfits with it's a sushi joint

813
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:19,080
And that's the actual name of it hot women and Asian hot Asian girls and out. No jailbait

814
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:29,080
Alright, whatever. I think we're going to go to that break now. Okay, alright. We'll

815
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:34,680
be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio and we're going to start this break

816
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:37,460
off. I said we do some in the groove music. We're going to start it off with a little

817
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:40,580
trance-y song called Walking on Fire because we haven't played this one yet on the show

818
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:44,660
And it's it's kind of neat so enjoy this and we'll be back with more orange laundry

819
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:18,580
All I can do is see all the helplessness behind me

820
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:24,580
I've faded too, off the headline

821
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:32,580
Crushing every feeling that sends me

822
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:33,580
I'm a Bubble Dancer

823
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:34,580

824
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:35,580

01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:39,580
Water and soap, splashing on my body

01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:43,580
Blow me a bubble and I'll give you a smack

828
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:46,580
Somewhere on your body

829
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:50,580
Oh, pick me up, P.O. Yeah, yeah

830
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:53,580

Say it tonight, the story of love's goin' on

01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:31,580
And you took part in the scene inside

844
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:34,580
You said that there's nothin' wrong

845
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:37,580

846
01:16:37,580 --> 01:16:39,580

01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:24,580
I'm Romeo, Juliet I'm Romeo, Juliet

858
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:31,580
I'm Romeo, Juliet I'm Romeo, Juliet

859
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:35,580
The only thing I know is that I can't use that instruction

860
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:38,580
I was made with passion

861
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:41,580
The only thing I know is that

862
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:45,580
I'm feeling satisfaction

863
01:18:45,580 --> 01:18:50,580
Feeling satisfaction

864
01:18:58,580 --> 01:19:03,580
I am a robot

865
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:37,580
Found this strange attraction

866
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:41,580
Was made for you, my dear

867
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:44,580
Was made for passion

868
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:47,580
The only thing I know is that

869
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:51,580
I could use that inspiration

870
01:19:51,580 --> 01:20:10,460
Gaming Radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us at Orange Lounge

871
01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:14,220
Radio.

872
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:22,380
back here on orange lounge radio music there from in tech groove coming to a

873
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:28,260
console near you eventually Romeo and Juliet before that touch me

874
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:34,500
bubble dancer walking on fire starting that set off well diverse stuff in there

875
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:39,780
I like bubble dancer because it sounds like aqua but like a real cheap aqua

876
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:44,500
knockoff which makes it even worse but at the same time the only reason you

877
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:48,540
liked aqua is because it was one of those it's so bad it's good so when it

878
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:55,300
gets badder it gets gooder nevermind we're gonna take your calls right now on

879
01:20:55,300 --> 01:21:01,500
the skype line www.orangeloungeradio.com click on interact with us and you can

880
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:03,960
call into the show although I don't know if we have a lot of people that want to

881
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:08,020
talk to us tonight because we don't have a lot of folks that are actually logged

882
01:21:08,020 --> 01:21:12,740
in to Skype right now so we'll see what happens. I don't know what's going on, I guess

883
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:15,860
because school's winding down for some people so a lot of folks can't stay up

884
01:21:15,860 --> 01:21:19,900
late tonight because they have finals tomorrow so and you know for our East Coast

885
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:23,260
listeners we're actually on pretty late. It's three hours later over there so

886
01:21:23,260 --> 01:21:28,620
we're looking at about 11 o'clock almost on the East Coast. Ouch. Well thank you to

887
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:31,460
our dedicated folks on the East Coast who stay up all night long to listen to

888
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:35,420
us but I guess during finals week it's a little bit harder so we're gonna have a

889
01:21:35,420 --> 01:21:39,400
a lot of people don't want to call in tonight. That's why you can check us out on Fridays.

890
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:44,420
Yes, on Fridays over at DDR Freak, if you want. And you know, if no one calls us, we

891
01:21:44,420 --> 01:21:48,100
have to get into Paris Hilton chat. And I don't think you want that tonight, no I'm

892
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:53,060
kidding. Even I'm sick of Paris Hilton chat. Nicole Richie chat, though. I've got a whole

893
01:21:53,060 --> 01:21:58,300
lot I could say about that. She sucks. She's Paris Hilton's partner. Oh, we're getting

894
01:21:58,300 --> 01:22:03,020
a call. Oh, on that stupid show. Yeah. I watched the sausage episode. Not anymore. Saved by

895
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:07,600
the call. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Hey, Sky, Siggy here. Hello, Siggy, how are

896
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:14,600
you? I'm doing fine. What's on your mind, sir? Well, yeah, last Friday I was able to

897
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:20,000
attend the World Series of Poker. Oh, yes, I remember you talking about that on last

898
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:25,060
week's show and you were going to win us millions of dollars, right? Unfortunately, I lost on

899
01:22:25,060 --> 01:22:28,940
the second level. Damn it! Well, at least you got to the second level. Which is going

900
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:34,580
It's going to be one of my FUs of the week tonight.

901
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:37,680
How bad did you lose?

902
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:41,380
I don't know how tournament poker works, but I guess how many people do you play against

903
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:43,540
at a time in tournament poker?

904
01:22:43,540 --> 01:22:47,860
There were 240 tables and there were 9 players.

905
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:49,660
Just multiply that by 9.

906
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:52,220
Oh my gosh.

907
01:22:52,220 --> 01:22:53,660
But you won?

908
01:22:53,660 --> 01:22:57,860
You beat, you won out of 9 people in the first round, right?

909
01:22:57,860 --> 01:23:00,860
Well, yeah. I already won over two tables.

910
01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:03,860
Oh, eh. That's not bad.

911
01:23:03,860 --> 01:23:06,860
But unfortunately I lost to a professional poker player.

912
01:23:06,860 --> 01:23:08,860
Oh, well that always kind of sucks.

913
01:23:08,860 --> 01:23:13,860
But, so you got up there a little bit then. That's still pretty cool. Good job.

914
01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:15,860
Maybe next year, maybe next year.

915
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:19,860
Yeah, maybe next year, because there goes my $1,000 buy-in.

916
01:23:19,860 --> 01:23:22,860
What? Oh my god, it was $1,000 to buy-in?

917
01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:24,860
Yeah.

918
01:23:24,860 --> 01:23:26,860
Oh my god, you didn't get any of it back.

919
01:23:26,860 --> 01:23:33,820
well no a thousand dollars for a freaking poker here's the thing here's

920
01:23:33,820 --> 01:23:39,540
the thing the top prize is seven hundred and twenty-five thousand Wow and with

921
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:43,100
it and then there's going to be a another no-limit tournament this Friday

922
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:48,040
which is going to be a $2,000 buy-in and you know it's going to be twice twice

923
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:52,580
enough for the top prize Wow that's pretty hard but can you imagine a DDR

924
01:23:52,580 --> 01:23:57,980
tournament with a thousand dollar buy-in? At least you could have the DDR tournament

925
01:23:57,980 --> 01:24:02,660
that has a harder run than that one. That's like, just under half of my monthly

926
01:24:02,660 --> 01:24:08,820
salary. That's messed up. Well, what do you expect? It's Vegas, right?

927
01:24:08,820 --> 01:24:11,920
Yeah. Alright. What do you have to say to the people

928
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:14,660
that are criticizing you for putting up a thousand dollars of your money?

929
01:24:14,660 --> 01:24:20,840
Well, it's just, you know, I've already planned this for months now.

930
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:25,240
everybody has their thing

931
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:28,160
you're allowed to spend money on post some people some people invest their

932

david williams john yugostino demand and break that one

970
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:18,540
but i would think

971
01:26:18,540 --> 01:26:23,980
i would think these guys hang out in vegas an awful lot

972
01:26:23,980 --> 01:26:25,780
yeah you know uh...

973
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:27,760

but you know

978
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:49,780
I wasn't, I was tired. You know, before I headed to Rio, I went to Circus Circus, you know, for some 2GX Red action, just to calm my nerves down.

979
01:26:50,780 --> 01:26:57,780
I swear I'm going to come out to Vegas soon. If my leisure trip to the East Coast ends up getting cancelled, I think I'm going to come to Vegas.

980
01:26:57,780 --> 01:27:05,780
Because I got money to burn, so. And I want to come play games at Circus Circus. Because you know Circus Circus was where I originally played DDR for the first time.

981
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:06,780
Yeah.

982
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:07,780
I have a lot of love.

983
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:11,340
All right, well, Siggy, we're going to let you go so we can take some of the calls, but

984
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:16,460
good luck practicing the poker, and I hope you can get at that final table next year,

985
01:27:16,460 --> 01:27:17,460
all right?

986
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:18,460
All right.

987
01:27:18,460 --> 01:27:19,460
All right.

988
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:20,460
Good luck.

989
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:21,460
Bye.

990
01:27:21,460 --> 01:27:22,460
Thank you.

991
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:23,460
All right.

992
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:24,460
Let's go ahead and take another call.

993
01:27:24,460 --> 01:27:25,460
Hi.

994
01:27:25,460 --> 01:27:26,460
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

995
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:27,460
Hey.

996
01:27:27,460 --> 01:27:28,460
What's up?

997
01:27:28,460 --> 01:27:29,460
It's the one and only Ronma.

998
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:30,460
Hello, Ronma.

999
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:31,460
How are you, buddy?

1000
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:32,460
Hi, Uchon.

1001
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:33,460
Hi, Uchon.

1002
01:27:33,460 --> 01:27:37,460
Warning! Cute factor approaching. Cute factor approaching.

1003
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:39,460
What's on your mind, my friend?

1004
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:45,460
Eh, not much. I just had a real twisted weekend. I was forced to quit my job.

1005
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:47,460
You were forced to quit your job?

1006
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:48,460
Yep.

1007
01:27:48,460 --> 01:27:54,460
Did somebody catch you in the storeroom with a lady, you know, something like that going on, or what?

1008
01:27:54,460 --> 01:27:58,460
No, I actually caught somebody else violating corporate policy.

1009
01:27:58,460 --> 01:28:00,460
Okay, how's that work? You gotta explain this one to me.

1010
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:07,340
Okay on geek squad you guys sell services one of the technicians was selling services, but he was pocketing the money. Oh

1011
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:11,020
So, how does that mean you lose your job?

1012
01:28:12,740 --> 01:28:18,860
I'm still trying more or less like they were I found that they were like tracking me and following me around

1013
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:22,500
It seems that before I went to an amazement

1014
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:27,260
I told my general manager what was going on got a customer to make a statement on what happened

1015
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:33,260
I made my statement. Go away. I come back. Oh, I come to find out that one of the managers wants to talk to me.

1016
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:40,260
It seems that I'm being accused of losing money in the department and I have an issue with not coming to work.

1017
01:28:40,260 --> 01:28:42,260
Huh.

1018
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:44,260
You don't get it.

1019
01:28:44,260 --> 01:28:49,260
Was this person who was selling stuff under the table like the boss's nephew or something?

1020
01:28:49,260 --> 01:28:54,260
No, but ever since he found out I knew something about it, he's been, he's had an issue with me.

1021
01:28:54,260 --> 01:29:05,260
I still say you need to nail their asses to the wall.

1022
01:29:05,260 --> 01:29:06,260
Oh, I am.

1023
01:29:06,260 --> 01:29:11,260
DarkStakra is a great- she can give you some good advice on where to go if you want to kick some butt.

1024
01:29:11,260 --> 01:29:13,260
Oh, I plan on it.

1025
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:17,260
Keep us posted on how that goes. How's your gaming week been?

1026
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:22,260
Pretty good, pretty good. I got a controller so now I've been playing PSO a little bit more than I should be.

1027
01:29:22,260 --> 01:29:23,260
Blue Burst?

1028
01:29:23,260 --> 01:29:24,260
Yes.

1029
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:27,260
Now, DarkSakurai, you had a fun time in Blue Burst tonight, didn't you?

1030
01:29:27,260 --> 01:29:28,260
Yes, you need to play with me.

1031
01:29:28,260 --> 01:29:31,260
I'm actually going to be starting an Orange Lounge radio team.

1032
01:29:31,260 --> 01:29:33,260
Okay, are you playing tonight?

1033
01:29:33,260 --> 01:29:34,260
Um, I can.

1034
01:29:34,260 --> 01:29:35,260
Okay.

1035
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:40,260
Only listeners are allowed to come into this room.

1036
01:29:40,260 --> 01:29:45,260
I always play on Hyperion 7, and the room is MurdockIs?

1037
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:48,260
And the password is God, with a capital G.

1038
01:29:48,260 --> 01:29:49,260
Alright.

1039
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:54,260
Since I have the memory retention of a goldfish, I will be asking this a little bit later.

1040
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:58,260
That's fine. We'll try and post a reminder in the chat room towards the end of the show on PSO.

1041
01:29:58,260 --> 01:29:59,260
Awesome.

1042
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:00,260
All right.

1043
01:30:00,260 --> 01:30:01,260

Well, have fun with that. Anything else you want to share with us?

1045
01:30:02,260 --> 01:30:09,260
Oh, and remember I called a few weeks back and I told you about the slash pizza icon I saw at Ama Boston?

1046
01:30:09,260 --> 01:30:10,260
Yes.

1047
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:13,260
I sent Dark Sakura the picture so you could take a look at it.

1048
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:16,260
Dark Sakura, do you have those pictures? You have to share those.

okay

1094
01:32:22,940 --> 01:32:27,540
the uh... i think it's the weekend right before of ohio con i think

1095
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:30,500
so what you've got to do you get distributors to come out there and show

1096
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:34,540
off the games everything or what but i had this will actually be our fourth

1097
01:32:34,540 --> 01:32:37,140
year that we've been doing the convention uh...

1098
01:32:37,140 --> 01:32:38,300
first-year

1099
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:42,160
was pretty good we had uh... enemy premier of ease

1100
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:44,240
we had the first

1101
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:48,460
turbo graphics sixteen ever made on display i love you

1102
01:32:48,460 --> 01:32:52,320
it actually had serial number zero zero zero zero zero one

1103
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,740
i i i want act

1104
01:32:54,740 --> 01:32:55,680
mind please

1105
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:57,060
that's pretty hot

1106
01:32:57,060 --> 01:33:02,140
i love the pc engine i thought seeing the last dreamcast ever made it was

1107
01:33:02,140 --> 01:33:03,020
pretty hot

1108
01:33:03,020 --> 01:33:04,780
but the first river graphics

1109
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:06,100
that's pretty hot as well

1110
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:10,740
yeah they had it in a little glass case and everything and it went like the con chairman

1111
01:33:10,740 --> 01:33:14,340
said yeah you'll find me curled up in a ditch in mexico with them

1112
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:17,120
it kinda sounds like what you've got going on is like

1113
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:20,020
similar to classic gaming expo

1114
01:33:20,020 --> 01:33:21,140
but uh... uh...

1115
01:33:21,140 --> 01:33:25,320
kinda yeah but more emphasis put on the fandom kinda like anime

1116
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:28,380
conventions are this one's for video games only

1117
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:31,160
oh god do you have cosplayers

1118
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:35,720
uh... last convention we had three and they got really pissy because we had a

1119
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:43,720
cosplay at two in the morning. There was like a really good like, Kosmos, but she

1120
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:48,800
like, obviously for an anime convention, her mentality was definitely not the

1121
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:54,040
right one for this convention. You can't have a convention, you can't have a geek

1122
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:58,720
convention happen without some rejected Ricky Lake guest doing Sailor Moon

1123
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:03,440
cosplay. Thankfully we didn't have any Sailor Moons or anything, it was all

1124
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:12,440
We had all video game characters. We had like a Sid from Final Fantasy IV, and that was really cool when Genova Project played live.

1125
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:16,440
He almost climbed up on stage while they were doing Final Fantasy IV Boss.

1126
01:34:16,440 --> 01:34:22,440
For those that don't know, Genova Project is the band that was before many bosses.

1127
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:24,440
We actually had them play live, too.

1128
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:29,440
Wow, sounds like you guys have a good time out there. I wish we were on the East Coast so we could check it out,

1129
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:39,440
But maybe in January we'll have money in the travel budget, so keep looking at the change that falls in the sofa, because that's the travel budget.

1130
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:43,440
You wouldn't be the only ones to be coming from California. We had about 50 people come from California.

1131
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:46,440
That's nice. That's nice. Good deal.

1132
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:52,440
Dude, if I was to go there, I would cosplay as King Hippo from Mike Tyson's Pink Out.

1133
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:55,440
Dude, one of the most underrated 8-bit characters.

1134
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:57,200
eggplantwizard

1135
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:59,900
we need eggplantwizard cosplay

1136
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:03,440
i actually want to cosplay as one of the guys from Russian Attack

1137
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:05,320
oh Akarnov dude

1138
01:35:05,320 --> 01:35:08,240
are you a bad enough dude to save the president?

1139
01:35:08,240 --> 01:35:12,680
let's get a cheeseburger

1140
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:16,840
we need a bunch of people to do a super dodgeball cosplay

1141
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:18,920
i've actually seen people do it

1142
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:23,800
or the kunio kun hot blooded downtown story also known as river city ransom

1143
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:31,800
At NekoCon, there was actually a group of five people that cosplayed as the frat guys from RCR.

1144
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:35,800
Wow. Did they say barf when they hit the floor and everything?

1145
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:38,800
Actually, they did. They did. It was really cool.

1146
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:40,800
That's awesome.

1147
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:47,800
They only did it because X-Strike Studios was showing RCR at River City Rumble at NekoCon, which is really cool.

1148
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:54,800
Wow. Actually, I have one more idea, and that's to dress up as Leisure Suit Larry, the original OG.

1149
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:55,800
Wow.

1150
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:57,800
Yeah, give Spanish Fly to the secretary.

1151
01:35:57,800 --> 01:36:00,800
So, how much floor space does this con take up?

1152
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:03,800
We take up the entire hotel.

1153
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:05,800
Oh, that's nice. That sounds like fun.

1154
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:07,800
24-hour game room.

1155
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:13,800
Land room is actually going to be split into four rooms, because last year I actually got it up to about 68 people.

1156
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:18,200
Wow well you know if our podcast takes off and you know we're able to sell out

1157
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:21,960
to the man and we get a travel budget we are so there. We'll check it out.

1158
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:28,400
Travel budget rock on. Yeah right now it's about five cents. So you can get down

1159
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:33,960
the block basically. Actually my other idea is to establish a swear jar because

1160
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:39,960
that shit would fill up fast. That would. We'd be dropping 20's in a night. We'd be going to Hawaii every month.

1161
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:42,960
Alright. Anything else you want to share with us?

1162
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:46,960
Um, probably just pimping for X-Strike.

1163
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:49,960
X-Strike Studios is going to be at AMA coming up in two weeks.

1164
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:56,960
They're going to be premiering Silent Horror, a video game movie that doesn't suck based on Silent Hill.

1165
01:36:56,960 --> 01:37:01,960
Wait a minute, so it's like an actual movie that's going to be released in the studios?

1166
01:37:01,960 --> 01:37:02,960
I kind of saw this already.

1167
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:03,960
What is this?

1168
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:04,960
The trailer for it.

1169
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:07,960
The trailer actually does no justice.

1170
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:11,080
Okay, because the trailer kind of sucked.

1171
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:15,160
Actually, the trailer does suck. I was like, wow, this makes Ui Bol look good.

1172
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:19,160
It's actually like, it's both funny as hell,

1173
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:23,400
because they make fun of every like horror genre at the same time,

1174
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:28,120
but it also is scary at parts. We've had people like think,

1175
01:37:28,120 --> 01:37:32,920
oh man, did you actually chop somebody's head in that shot? And they're like, no.

1176
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:37,360
Well hey, you know the movie Scream was the same idea where it had like the humor and the

1177
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:40,840
actual scary stuff mixed in, and from what I hear, that movie did pretty good.

1178
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:41,840
So you never know.

1179
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:45,960
And a movie that has a line saying, that's like, what are you doing with all that crap?

1180
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:50,440
Well you never know when you're going to need an empty lighter fluid can to fill up a lighter

1181
01:37:50,440 --> 01:37:54,600
or a freakishly large statue to press the switch.

1182
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:56,880
It's good to have a well stocked inventory.

1183
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:58,160
Do they have a distributor for it?

1184
01:37:58,160 --> 01:38:01,480
Are they still trying to find something?

1185
01:38:01,480 --> 01:38:04,800
It's actually, they're sending it off to the DVD pressers.

1186
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:10,620
They're going with a different DVD press and company that they did for River City Rumble.

1187
01:38:10,620 --> 01:38:13,860
So it should be for sale at AMA.

1188
01:38:13,860 --> 01:38:16,000
It's actually going to kind of premiere at AMA.

1189
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Very cool.

1190
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:22,320
Two commentaries, an outtake track, deleted scenes, director's commentary.

1191
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:23,320
It's a fully loaded DVD.

1192
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:25,060
Well, good luck to those guys.

1193
01:38:25,060 --> 01:38:28,980
I love B-movies with inside jokes, so that sounds like fun.

1194
01:38:28,980 --> 01:38:29,980
So it's a bunch of gamer nerds-

1195
01:38:29,980 --> 01:38:32,280
And be sure to watch the Transformer reference.

1196
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:33,960
It's a bunch of gamer nerds that did this?

1197
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:35,960
Oh absolutely. It'll be great. It'll be great.

1198
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:39,960
It's x-strikestudios.com.

1199
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:41,960
x-strikestudios.com. Sounds good.

1200
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:43,960
Well thank you for calling us and I hope you have a good one.

1201
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:44,960
No problem.

1202
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:45,960
Have fun at your con.

1203
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:46,960
I need more beer.

1204
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:47,960
Seven months. Alright, have...

1205
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:49,960
Hey, have another bud for us, alright?

1206
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:51,960
Oh, it's Killian's tonight.

1207
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:54,960
Sounds good. Actually, have a Guinness. Have a Guinness for us, because that's...

1208
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:55,960
The Guinness is really beer.

1209
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:56,960
I wish I had some.

1210
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:57,960
Alright.

1211
01:38:57,960 --> 01:38:58,960
Good stuff. Alright, have a good one, buddy.

1212
01:38:58,960 --> 01:38:59,960
Alright, bye.

1213
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:00,960
Later.

1214
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:04,800
getting his name from the rez trans vibrator. That's awesome.

1215
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:10,800
Teramisu, um, god, um, what is it, uh, the, what is that, that liqueur in it.

1216
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:17,800
It has booze, I must have some. Okay, we're gonna get some teramisu as we get into cage match here because

1217
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:23,800
Coffee liqueur. I don't really like teramisu usually though, but I'm, is it off, is it, uh, Olive Garden teramisu?

1218
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:29,800
No, it's teramisu from Ellie's. Hmm. I will have a small corner because I've eaten, like, most people eat all day.

1219
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:33,000
I'll give it a try. I will give it a try. I have eaten mostly meat today.

1220
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:39,800
Alright. Of course if I take this piece home and spread it out over the week, I can get away with it.

1221
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:44,800
Alright, let's get into tonight's cage match, Poison Girls.

1222
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:52,800
Last week in the Orange Lounge cage match, the Gorillaz were entered in and they won in a narrow victory

1223
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:58,800
with their song, Dare, which is kind of a dance-y song which you don't hear from Gorillaz very often, but it's fun.

1224
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:00,320
Happy Monday song.

1225
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:02,640
It's very happy, but Mondays aren't happy,

1226
01:40:02,640 --> 01:40:03,680
so I don't know what that's all about.

1227
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:05,080
All right.

1228
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:06,360
Anyway, the way the cage match works,

1229
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:10,080
you must be in our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

1230
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:12,280
We will play three songs for you.

1231
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:14,000
Last week's winner, just a clip,

1232
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,480
because you already heard it last week,

1233
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:18,000
and two new songs in their entirety.

1234
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,000
And the winning song goes into rotation all week long

1235
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:24,480
on Orange Lounge Radio's video game music program,

1236
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:26,520
which plays 24 hours a day, seven days a week

1237
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:29,280
on this station when we aren't live.

1238
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:32,200
And what is the criteria for these songs

1239
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:34,440
to be in the cage match?

1240
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:35,920
They have to kick ass.

1241
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:37,080
We just have to like them.

1242
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:38,040
That's the only criteria.

1243
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:40,000
They don't have to be related to games at all.

1244
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:43,080
It's just cool stuff we think you should hear.

1245
01:40:43,080 --> 01:40:44,880
So here it is, a clip of last week's winner.

1246
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:45,840
Song number one.

1247
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:47,480
Is it worthy of a two-week victory?

1248
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:48,240
You be the judge.

1249
01:40:48,240 --> 01:40:49,720
Gorillas dare.

1250
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:54,720
I'm still alive

1251
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:00,720
Never did know I'm

1252
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:02,720
Never did know I'm

1253
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:07,720
Each day

1254
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:09,720
It's coming up, it's coming up

1255
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:11,720
It's coming up, it's coming up

1256
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:12,720
It's coming up

1257
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:14,720
It's dead

1258
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:23,720
It's dead

1259
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:34,720
You've got depression on you

1260
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:40,720
You just thinkin' that's what you do, baby

1261
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:44,720
Hold it down, yeah

1262
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:49,720
Just feel the moment

1263
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:52,720
Jump back and forth

1264
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:56,720
Feel like you were banging down

1265
01:41:56,720 --> 01:41:59,720
Working out

1266
01:42:02,720 --> 01:42:04,720
Never did no harm

1267
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:06,720
Never did no harm

1268
01:42:36,720 --> 01:42:49,720
All right, that was a clip of song number one, Dare, by the Gorillaz.

1269
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:53,280
Okay, let's get into a new song, which will play in its entirety.

1270
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:55,000
This one's six minutes.

1271
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,000
This better be good, Loki.

1272
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
What do you got for us?

1273
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,360
Well, it's not a girls remix.

1274
01:43:00,360 --> 01:43:01,360
Sorry.

1275
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:02,360
Oh, sorry.

1276
01:43:02,360 --> 01:43:04,440
Let's see, now Girls Butts is okay.

1277
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:05,440
Girls by Prodigy?

1278
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:12,440
okay. Now, this is something I didn't really have much to bring this week, so I was going

1279
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:18,540
through some of my old CDs that have been ripping into my hard drive, and I found one

1280
01:43:18,540 --> 01:43:23,920
on the verse 1 and 2, which it hid from me. And this is a remix, and I don't even remember

1281
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:29,960
the title of it, because it's really strange. And it's a remix of basically Tac stuff, and

1282
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:34,980
you've got it says it's mainly the XY but they threw in holic stuff in there

1283
01:43:34,980 --> 01:43:41,380
as well I think I've heard this before it's direct C D Re X I Y I'm calling it

1284
01:43:41,380 --> 01:43:46,940
direct C which sounds like an eating disorder to me but whatever I don't know

1285
01:43:46,940 --> 01:43:52,660
all right it's pretty cool I mean I was trying to find a short song is this the

1286
01:43:52,660 --> 01:43:57,440
artist is the artist name really VA on this no that's just very art various

1287
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:02,660
artists cuz it's on diverse systems I can look it up but I mean it take me a

1288
01:44:02,660 --> 01:44:08,740
sec but yeah basically I mean it should be enjoyable you'll just say it's by

1289
01:44:08,740 --> 01:44:12,060
diverse systems so this is diverse systems if you like Taku you should like

1290
01:44:12,060 --> 01:44:16,820
this all right here it is song number two in tonight's cage match direct see

1291
01:44:16,820 --> 01:44:18,820
Enjoy!

1292
01:50:16,820 --> 01:50:19,320
Alright, there was song number two tonight, Durexi.

1293
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:24,320
Uh, is that, uh, Durexi good or Durexi bad? Let's find out. Dark Sakura.

1294
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:29,820
I like lots of parts of it, and you know me, I love Taku.

1295
01:50:29,820 --> 01:50:34,320
But, there were parts that just sort of, kind of dragged on like that part at the end.

1296
01:50:34,820 --> 01:50:35,820
Um...

1297
01:50:38,820 --> 01:50:39,820
Seven.

1298
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:42,820
Solid, but kind of dragged a bit.

1299
01:50:42,820 --> 01:50:48,820
My vote. Whatever. I give it a six for the number of minutes.

1300
01:50:48,820 --> 01:50:49,820
Loki.

1301
01:50:49,820 --> 01:50:51,820
Next time I'm picking a ten minute song.

1302
01:50:51,820 --> 01:50:56,820
Oh, but I give the tiramisu a ten, by the way, because it tasted like liquor, and that makes me happy.

1303
01:50:56,820 --> 01:51:01,820
I vote as a good song just because it reminded me a lot of the Legend of Attack song that I did a long time ago.

1304
01:51:01,820 --> 01:51:09,820
Which I kind of do something else, because originally that Legend of Attack song was supposed to be every single Attack song in one mix.

1305
01:51:09,820 --> 01:51:12,820
But, uh, I stopped before I finished.

1306
01:51:12,820 --> 01:51:16,820
Anyway, um, no, I give it like a 8, because it's good.

1307
01:51:16,820 --> 01:51:19,820
Islander.

1308
01:51:19,820 --> 01:51:25,820
I'd probably give it about a 6-2, but then, because my reasoning is, it was, it...

1309
01:51:25,820 --> 01:51:27,820
I, too, Phil, it was a little too long.

1310
01:51:27,820 --> 01:51:29,820
Could've done without a few things.

1311
01:51:29,820 --> 01:51:31,820
Alrighty.

1312
01:51:31,820 --> 01:51:36,820
Let's go on to song number 3. Song number 3, somebody sent me the music video for this during the week,

1313
01:51:36,820 --> 01:51:41,900
week and it reminded me about how funny this song is so and I love the video

1314
01:51:41,900 --> 01:51:47,700
it's so funny so um and it's actually a pretty decent dance song so I chose this

1315
01:51:47,700 --> 01:51:51,900
song it's kind of like I wouldn't say it's a remake of an 80s classic but it

1316
01:51:51,900 --> 01:51:57,660
invokes an 80s classic so this is Eric pride and the song is called call on me

1317
01:51:57,660 --> 01:51:59,660
Enjoy!

1318
01:54:27,660 --> 01:54:56,100
Song number three, Eric Prides, Call On Me, will you guys be calling that song back or

1319
01:54:56,100 --> 01:54:58,800
or will you conveniently lose its number? Dark Sakura.

1320
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:03,380
I love the original, but that one was also really repetitive. It has some...

1321
01:55:03,380 --> 01:55:06,820
It would be good for DDR, I think, if it were cut down to a minute and a half,

1322
01:55:06,820 --> 01:55:08,500
but it was just

1323
01:55:08,500 --> 01:55:11,340
too repetitive. It gets a six-and-a-half.

1324
01:55:11,340 --> 01:55:12,380
Loki.

1325
01:55:12,380 --> 01:55:14,900
The club song's supposed to be repetitive. Actually, it's...

1326
01:55:14,900 --> 01:55:19,720
For me, it has the same elements of a Daft Punk song, where it's simple, it can be

1327
01:55:19,720 --> 01:55:22,300
repetitive, but it's still catchy,

1328
01:55:22,300 --> 01:55:26,540
and it doesn't get really annoying, and that's what's cool about Daft Punk, and I think there

1329
01:55:26,540 --> 01:55:30,860
may be even some Fat Boy Slim songs like that and stuff, but it's just, it's one of the

1330
01:55:30,860 --> 01:55:36,220
songs that lends itself to a club scene very well, so get to nine, it's good.

1331
01:55:36,220 --> 01:55:41,260
Sometimes I wish we were a TV show, because honestly, that song isn't done justice without

1332
01:55:41,260 --> 01:55:46,820
the video. Yes, isn't the, I remember the... The video is all these, it's women working

1333
01:55:46,820 --> 01:55:51,540
out, and like, they're wearing like Jane Fonda style attire, it's like full-on 80s, but here's

1334
01:55:51,540 --> 01:55:57,540
Here's the thing. Consistent tits and ass shots. Consistently through the video.

1335
01:55:57,540 --> 01:56:00,540
I remember the video for this and that was hilarious.

1336
01:56:00,540 --> 01:56:05,540
And then there's just some random guy there too that's just working out. It's funny. I don't know.

1337
01:56:05,540 --> 01:56:10,540
I laughed. Okay, I'm gay and I thought it was funny, but maybe it's the whole boobies thing. I don't know.

1338
01:56:10,540 --> 01:56:12,540
Because they say gay men are infatuated with boobies.

1339
01:56:12,540 --> 01:56:16,540
Islander, who is not a gay man, but is still infatuated with boobies.

1340
01:56:16,540 --> 01:56:19,540
Oh, absolutely.

1341
01:56:19,540 --> 01:56:41,540
But no, I sort of agree there with Loki's comments how it does lend itself to the club scene, it's in that mold of Daft Punk and whatnot, and if you don't mind hearing that type of music, I for one don't. I would bump that in my car. I'd give that probably an 8.

1342
01:56:41,540 --> 01:56:44,540
Alright, and eight for eighties. How's that?

1343
01:56:44,540 --> 01:56:49,540
Absolutely. Let's see. Okay, so, um, pretty diverse selection here tonight in the cage match.

1344
01:56:49,540 --> 01:56:53,540
Remember, our votes don't count for shit. It's all up to you guys in the chat room.

1345
01:56:53,540 --> 01:56:58,540
So here it is, the three songs you can vote for tonight, starting it off with song number one,

1346
01:56:58,540 --> 01:57:15,260
last week's winner going for win number two Gorillaz Dare and song number two you

1347
01:57:15,260 --> 01:57:29,020
can vote for tonight, Diverse System with Durexi.

1348
01:57:29,020 --> 01:57:36,340
And song number three can vote for tonight, Eric Pride's Call On Me.

1349
01:57:36,340 --> 01:57:47,700
Alright, place vote now, send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote, and

1350
01:57:47,700 --> 01:57:51,820
if you don't know how to do that, hold on, I'll tell you guys in our chat room how to

1351
01:57:51,820 --> 01:57:53,620
momentarily.

1352
01:57:53,620 --> 01:57:55,060
You guys have about three minutes.

1353
01:57:55,060 --> 01:57:59,900
Loki, this is the part of the show where I tell, I let you explain what's going on in

1354
01:57:59,900 --> 01:58:00,900
the sim world.

1355
01:58:00,900 --> 01:58:04,000
Well, I explained a little bit what's going on in the sim world, like for example, there

1356
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:10,480
It's a sim file for my song Legend of the Trance 2005, which you can find on by myself.

1357
01:58:10,480 --> 01:58:14,640
There's a few other things that happened as far as releases go.

1358
01:58:14,640 --> 01:58:24,320
There was DDRXXMix, and I know that's a weird name, but it's Japanese, so what can we say?

1359
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:30,800
They released version 2.5, which has some more songs in it, and it's actually a good

1360
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:35,480
80 meg downloads, so you can go check that out as well.

1361
01:58:35,480 --> 01:58:39,560
Then there's also another one.

1362
01:58:39,560 --> 01:58:42,760
It's actually kind of an older one that came out around this

1363
01:58:42,760 --> 01:58:44,720
time food mix one came out.

1364
01:58:44,720 --> 01:58:51,240
And it's party night.

1365
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:54,000
Dance Dance Revolution, I guess, party night edition or

1366
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:55,360
something like that.

1367
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:58,200
They're calling it DDR party night mix

1368
01:58:58,200 --> 01:59:00,200
appendix series number one.

1369
01:59:00,200 --> 01:59:06,740
that's kind of a tongue twister but basically what that is is a good

1370
01:59:06,740 --> 01:59:14,140
download for you that's about oh I don't know it's it's pretty big 216 megs so

1371
01:59:14,140 --> 01:59:19,540
that's quite quite quite the download there so go check that out now granted

1372
01:59:19,540 --> 01:59:25,780
the first party night mix was not very good but um definitely recommend oh I'm

1373
01:59:25,780 --> 01:59:29,780
I'm sorry, not XX Mixes, DDR D3 Mix 2.5.

1374
01:59:29,780 --> 01:59:30,980
And check that out.

1375
01:59:30,980 --> 01:59:34,280
That's going to be pretty good as well, because I actually

1376
01:59:34,280 --> 01:59:35,320
played some of that stuff.

1377
01:59:35,320 --> 01:59:36,580
And it's pretty cool.

1378
01:59:36,580 --> 01:59:40,020
And then if you want, there's a whole thread on Bamaiso.

1379
01:59:40,020 --> 01:59:44,140
You can check out the brand new Japanese little fan mixes

1380
01:59:44,140 --> 01:59:45,580
that are being released.

1381
01:59:45,580 --> 01:59:50,180
And definitely watch that closely, because we're still

1382
01:59:50,180 --> 01:59:51,980
waiting, Food Mix 2.

1383
01:59:51,980 --> 01:59:55,540
And when that comes out, it's going to be pretty awesome.

1384
01:59:55,540 --> 01:59:57,940
But remember last week, the manhole.

1385
01:59:57,940 --> 02:00:00,580
Find it on, they have a song called Manhole.

1386
02:00:04,420 --> 02:00:05,220
Yeah, that's right.

1387
02:00:05,220 --> 02:00:07,620
We do have the maturity level of preschool.

1388
02:00:07,620 --> 02:00:11,380
Anyways, yeah, that's pretty much what's going on in the

1389
02:00:11,380 --> 02:00:12,700
sim scene right now.

1390
02:00:12,700 --> 02:00:14,020
So check those out.

1391
02:00:14,020 --> 02:00:18,660
And watch Bahmani Style's sim file database, because every

1392
02:00:18,660 --> 02:00:20,300
now and then there will be a good one.

1393
02:00:20,300 --> 02:00:23,220
But in the meantime, you'll have to deal with Paranoia

1394
02:00:23,220 --> 02:00:29,180
Twist, Omega, and Max Evo.

1395
02:00:29,180 --> 02:00:31,460
Enjoy.

1396
02:00:31,460 --> 02:00:33,780
Goody, goody.

1397
02:00:33,780 --> 02:00:35,860
Just a reminder, you boys and girls out there, we have a

1398
02:00:35,860 --> 02:00:39,180
podcast where we talk about other games.

1399
02:00:39,180 --> 02:00:41,500
We talk about games that don't suck and the news you really

1400
02:00:41,500 --> 02:00:42,820
want to know about.

1401
02:00:42,820 --> 02:00:44,180
That's available on our website,

1402
02:00:44,180 --> 02:00:46,780
www.orangeloungeradio.com.

1403
02:00:46,780 --> 02:00:49,820
Just click on the Orange Lounge Radio to Go edition,

1404
02:00:49,820 --> 02:00:51,620
which is over on the left-hand side.

1405
02:00:51,620 --> 02:00:53,580
And you can download that.

1406
02:00:53,580 --> 02:00:55,940
And actually, that show's been very successful for us, so

1407
02:00:55,940 --> 02:00:58,340
we're pretty happy about that.

1408
02:00:58,340 --> 02:01:00,820
Also, if you have a chance, give us a vote over on

1409
02:01:00,820 --> 02:01:03,180
Podcast Alley, because we like attention.

1410
02:01:03,180 --> 02:01:05,300
Even though that site is turning into one big

1411
02:01:05,300 --> 02:01:07,660
popularity contest, hey.

1412
02:01:07,660 --> 02:01:08,740
We like popularity.

1413
02:01:08,740 --> 02:01:09,940
We like being popular.

1414
02:01:09,940 --> 02:01:11,220
Doesn't everyone?

1415
02:01:11,220 --> 02:01:12,740
So give us a vote over there.

1416
02:01:12,740 --> 02:01:14,620
I'll paste a link in the chat room for you guys who want to

1417
02:01:14,620 --> 02:01:14,820
do that.

1418
02:01:14,820 --> 02:01:16,420
Oh, I completely forgot to mention earlier

1419
02:01:16,420 --> 02:01:18,260
during my week stuff.

1420
02:01:18,260 --> 02:01:20,740
There was actually something.

1421
02:01:20,740 --> 02:01:25,380
it's not like huge but it is rather significant to happen this week

1422
02:01:25,380 --> 02:01:27,920
uh...

1423
02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:31,780
i may have made fun of the song earlier this week or not really this week but

1424
02:01:31,780 --> 02:01:35,160
when we were talking about karaoke Revolution 4 but uh...

1425
02:01:35,160 --> 02:01:37,340
Patrick Swayze came to my work

1426
02:01:37,340 --> 02:01:39,340
how many people can say that

1427
02:01:39,340 --> 02:01:43,660
Patrick Swayze came to my work as well as his wife it was on Channel 3 News

1428
02:01:43,660 --> 02:01:45,460
local here in Sacramento

1429
02:01:45,460 --> 02:01:49,780
and uh... he was basically promoting his new movie that's going to be coming out called Last Dance

1430
02:01:49,780 --> 02:01:55,060
which is about his, I guess, you know, he started off classically trained as, you know, ballet, so...

1431
02:01:55,060 --> 02:01:56,740
That was a Donna Summer song.

1432
02:01:56,740 --> 02:02:00,380
Anyways, um, The Last Dance, it's gonna be coming out, um...

1433
02:02:00,380 --> 02:02:03,980
Last dance. Last dance. Oh, sorry.

1434
02:02:03,980 --> 02:02:11,740
Anyways, so yeah, he's, yeah, I got an autograph, um, and scene from his wife, who actually directed and, uh, wrote the movie.

1435
02:02:11,740 --> 02:02:19,100
And, uh, he actually flew in on his plane, um, into the Karen Park Airport nearby here, so he's a pilot and all this stuff.

1436
02:02:19,100 --> 02:02:32,600
Quite interesting. Really funny guy, too. So, I had a picture with him. Unfortunately, my friend's camera broke. So, no picture with him, unfortunately. But, um, yeah. So another celebrity sighting at my work.

1437
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:45,100
You know, I realize they did a sequel to Dirty Dancing. But overlooking that piece of crap, they should do, like, a new sequel to Dirty Dancing with Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey.

1438
02:02:45,100 --> 02:02:46,100
He- he- honestly-

1439
02:02:46,100 --> 02:02:48,600
But they need to give her back her, like, old nose.

1440
02:02:48,600 --> 02:03:00,600
He's doing a movie right now because this whole movie is supposed to be about going inside the mind of a dancer, like what they're experiencing. So it's kind of a surreal movie in a sense.

1441
02:03:00,600 --> 02:03:14,600
But it's kind of going in the mind of a dancer. So he says a couple movies like this, or if he's going to be able to do a couple movies, because he says you've got to be in incredible shape to be able to do this kind of ballet.

1442
02:03:14,600 --> 02:03:16,360
But Dirty Dancing, man, I can do that until I die.

1443
02:03:16,360 --> 02:03:20,720
So maybe, you know, there'll be another Dirty Dancing movie.

1444
02:03:20,720 --> 02:03:22,680
I know he's got a few other movies coming out,

1445
02:03:22,680 --> 02:03:23,720
though, right now, but.

1446
02:03:23,720 --> 02:03:27,680
Dude, they could combine the Dirty Dancing sequel

1447
02:03:27,680 --> 02:03:30,360
with the DDR Freak movie.

1448
02:03:30,360 --> 02:03:33,760
Because you know how that always comes up?

1449
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:35,200
It's dancy dancing!

1450
02:03:35,200 --> 02:03:37,840
OMG to DDR Freak movie?

1451
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:40,760
That's what it could be, is it could be Patrick Swayze

1452
02:03:40,760 --> 02:03:45,040
Jennifer Grey, like, reunited to win to dinner competition.

1453
02:03:45,040 --> 02:03:51,560
That is ridiculous.

1454
02:03:51,560 --> 02:03:56,720
And then, like, they can get to the competition, and now, for the final challenge, where you

1455
02:03:56,720 --> 02:04:02,880
You will have to face Dark, Patrick Swayze.

1456
02:04:02,880 --> 02:04:07,800
Dark Swayze!

1457
02:04:07,800 --> 02:04:13,920
Use the force.

1458
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:20,920
Use the bar, Luke.

1459
02:04:22,600 --> 02:04:25,440
I can't do this.

1460
02:04:25,440 --> 02:04:29,240
All right, let's find out who won tonight's cage match, shall we?

1461
02:04:29,240 --> 02:04:30,000
Yes, please.

1462
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:30,760
All right.

1463
02:04:30,760 --> 02:04:36,040
Tonight's cage match, boys and girls, it is a tie.

1464
02:04:36,040 --> 02:04:37,200
It's a tie in tonight's cage.

1465
02:04:37,200 --> 02:04:38,120
Yes, it's a tie.

1466
02:04:38,120 --> 02:04:39,120
What?

1467
02:04:39,120 --> 02:04:40,480
All right, here it is.

1468
02:04:40,480 --> 02:04:41,240
Two songs tied.

1469
02:04:41,240 --> 02:04:42,840
I'm going to remind you guys what happens in a tie,

1470
02:04:42,840 --> 02:04:45,000
but let's first find out the two songs that tied.

1471
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:51,400
Song number one that tied tonight, Direct C.

1472
02:04:51,400 --> 02:04:52,440
All six minutes of it.

1473
02:04:52,440 --> 02:04:55,080
And song number two that tied in tonight's cage match

1474
02:04:55,080 --> 02:05:06,840
was Gorillaz with Dare. Now, the rules of a tie say that the host who put in the song

1475
02:05:06,840 --> 02:05:13,940
that did not end up in the tie gets to break the tie. That's me! So I get to break the

1476
02:05:13,940 --> 02:05:20,940
tie tonight because you bastards didn't vote for call on me. So, um, who loves me more?

1477
02:05:20,940 --> 02:05:22,740
I buy you food sometimes.

1478
02:05:22,740 --> 02:05:27,180
I brought you cake. That's true, you did bring me tiramisu.

1479
02:05:27,180 --> 02:05:29,380
I brought you liquor. Uh, that's true, but um...

1480
02:05:29,380 --> 02:05:35,380
you know, Direxie just went on for way too long, so I have to give it to Dare tonight.

1481
02:05:35,380 --> 02:05:38,300
But Dare's gone on for two weeks already.

1482
02:05:38,300 --> 02:05:40,100
Too late, I've made up my mind.

1483
02:05:40,100 --> 02:05:45,540
It has the mighty power of Sean Ryder and Damon.

1484
02:05:45,540 --> 02:05:49,140
Oh, we got a weird buzzy sound on here.

1485
02:05:49,140 --> 02:05:51,660
um... so there is

1486
02:05:51,660 --> 02:05:52,680
uh...

1487
02:05:52,680 --> 02:05:56,540
something weak win number two for dare so we'll be back next week to see if it

1488
02:05:56,540 --> 02:06:00,500
can go for dare to stay off drugs

1489
02:06:00,500 --> 02:06:03,940
did they have a report on people singing that song to be saying that about you

1490
02:06:03,940 --> 02:06:07,120
want to know okay you want to know what a geek i was in elementary school think

1491
02:06:07,120 --> 02:06:11,780
back to the what what what year would this been like eighty nine

1492
02:06:11,780 --> 02:06:14,420
we had the dare program in schools i don't know if this is a nationwide

1493
02:06:14,420 --> 02:06:17,780
thing or just california but dare was the drug

1494
02:06:17,780 --> 02:06:21,760
abuse resistance education i think is what it's about like that anti-drug

1495
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:25,000
program but they say that it was an utter failure because what it ended up

1496
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:28,560
doing is actually talk it about all the drugs that was out there

1497
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:32,160
dot that's what they need to be funny exactly

1498
02:06:32,160 --> 02:06:37,860
that and that i mean you know it does that we are a nationwide thing

1499
02:06:37,860 --> 02:06:41,240
i might go my own well my ex-fiance in colorado

1500
02:06:41,240 --> 02:06:44,000
she was a dear graduate twice

1501
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:52,000
Still ended up, still ended up smoking, shooting up anything she can get her hands on.

1502
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,000
Wow.

1503
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:54,000
I don't know.

1504
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:57,880
I'm going to go get me some drugs now.

1505
02:06:57,880 --> 02:07:03,040
Everybody in the chat room knows what I'm talking about, so they're all saying yes,

1506
02:07:03,040 --> 02:07:04,040
it's nationwide.

1507
02:07:04,040 --> 02:07:05,040
So cool.

1508
02:07:05,040 --> 02:07:07,840
For our international audience, sorry, you're just screwed.

1509
02:07:07,840 --> 02:07:09,140
But here's the thing.

1510
02:07:09,140 --> 02:07:12,840
I don't know why I remember this, but I remember they had a little workbook that had all these

1511
02:07:12,840 --> 02:07:17,560
exercises on it. You're supposed to identify different drugs. One of them was create your

1512
02:07:17,560 --> 02:07:22,680
own license plate. What that has to do with drugs, I don't remember. I don't know. I think

1513
02:07:22,680 --> 02:07:28,280
it was like, if you go to jail, then you'll be making license plates. So they had a make

1514
02:07:28,280 --> 02:07:30,800
your own license plate. But if they wanted to be really realistic,

1515
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:33,720
you know, they'd have to have the rubber glove up the ass and...

1516
02:07:33,720 --> 02:07:38,360
Yeah, yeah, seriously. They'd have... Cavity surge and bend over and spread them.

1517
02:07:38,360 --> 02:07:42,720
They'd have all us 5th graders take our clothes off and go shower publicly and have Bubba

1518
02:07:42,720 --> 02:07:43,720
fuck us while...

1519
02:07:43,720 --> 02:07:45,720
And teach you how to make hooch.

1520
02:07:45,720 --> 02:07:54,440
Here is a can of Juicy Juice, here is yeast that we use to make the hard tack you have

1521
02:07:54,440 --> 02:07:55,440
to eat.

1522
02:07:55,440 --> 02:07:56,940
Okay, wait, I'm not done with my thought yet.

1523
02:07:56,940 --> 02:08:00,920
So we had to make a license plate and the deal was, you know, you have to have it be

1524
02:08:00,920 --> 02:08:01,920
eight letters.

1525
02:08:01,920 --> 02:08:05,240
So it was like, what would your license plate say, right?

1526
02:08:05,240 --> 02:08:14,440
My license plate was N-I-N-1-0-D-O. Nintendo. Get it?

1527
02:08:14,440 --> 02:08:19,520
You are such a nerd and I like that. I wonder if anyone actually has that license

1528
02:08:19,520 --> 02:08:21,360
plate. Dude, I should get it.

1529
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:30,040
Aw, if nobody has it in California yet. Remember, Genesis does what Nintendon't.

1530
02:08:30,040 --> 02:08:32,040
What the fuck?

1531
02:08:32,040 --> 02:08:37,040
Sonic the Hedgehog, bitch!

1532
02:08:37,040 --> 02:08:39,040
Bad knuckles.

1533
02:08:39,040 --> 02:08:41,040
And by the way, Shadow the Hedgehog sucks ass.

1534
02:08:41,040 --> 02:08:43,040
But he has a gun.

1535
02:08:43,040 --> 02:08:46,040
I'm just reading some comments in our chatroom, I love it.

1536
02:08:46,040 --> 02:08:50,040
Ron Chan says, super sloppy OLR double dare.

1537
02:08:50,040 --> 02:08:53,040
That's what dare makes you think of that show, double dare.

1538
02:08:53,040 --> 02:08:57,040
And then I still have my dare shirt. That's awesome.

1539
02:08:57,040 --> 02:08:59,040
I didn't think they were still doing dare.

1540
02:08:59,040 --> 02:09:03,040
You know, I expect to see something like that at Hot Topic soon, because they're doing like all the...

1541
02:09:03,040 --> 02:09:04,040
Yes!

1542
02:09:04,040 --> 02:09:06,040
They do have them! They do have them at Hot Topic!

1543
02:09:06,040 --> 02:09:07,040
Do they?

1544
02:09:07,040 --> 02:09:08,040
Yes!

1545
02:09:08,040 --> 02:09:09,040
You know it'd be awesome. I love Hot Topic.

1546
02:09:09,040 --> 02:09:15,040
And then they also have the, um, the, uh, drug testing, and it has like a bunch of drugs sitting in the classroom.

1547
02:09:15,040 --> 02:09:21,040
You know what I want, just for the hell of it, is I want those prop sandwiches that they had on Double there.

1548
02:09:21,040 --> 02:09:28,040
I just want two of those giant pieces of bread to put on my floor. The foam bread. I don't know why that would be so cool, though.

1549
02:09:28,040 --> 02:09:30,340
dude f that i want the giant hamster wheel

1550
02:09:30,340 --> 02:09:34,220
the hamster wheel oh my god that'd be cool you know what i i would uh... you

1551
02:09:34,220 --> 02:09:37,740

02:09:37,740 --> 02:09:39,620

1553
02:09:39,620 --> 02:09:41,920

02:09:50,100 --> 02:09:53,580
every obstacle course had that damn hamster wheel in it somewhere

1557
02:09:53,580 --> 02:09:59,700
I forgot to mention, a couple weeks ago on Family Guy, they actually referenced You Can't

1558
02:09:59,700 --> 02:10:00,700
Do That television.

1559
02:10:00,700 --> 02:10:03,460
Yes, I actually saw that episode, but we don't encourage people to watch Family Guy.

1560
02:10:03,460 --> 02:10:04,460
That was a couple weeks ago!

1561
02:10:04,460 --> 02:10:08,460
Yeah, it's on the same time as us, so we don't encourage people to go watch that.

1562
02:10:08,460 --> 02:10:09,460
TiVo it!

1563
02:10:09,460 --> 02:10:10,460
It's a good show?

1564
02:10:10,460 --> 02:10:11,460
TiVo or BitTorrent?

1565
02:10:11,460 --> 02:10:12,460
Yes.

1566
02:10:12,460 --> 02:10:14,540
We encourage you to pirate Family Guy because it's our competition.

1567
02:10:14,540 --> 02:10:18,860
Hey, BitTorrent is mainly just free TiVo, that's all it is to me.

1568
02:10:18,860 --> 02:10:22,180
Don't worry, I delete the episodes after 24 hours.

1569
02:10:22,180 --> 02:10:26,580
Yes, 24 hours so that you're not pirating it. Love it.

1570
02:10:26,580 --> 02:10:34,300
All right. We're going to go to a break. Featuring some music this break from Dance Maniacs.

1571
02:10:34,300 --> 02:10:36,900
What about the Hannah Wavy Game? What, what, what?

1572
02:10:36,900 --> 02:10:39,460
Oh, yeah, you wanted to do the clips, didn't you?

1573
02:10:39,460 --> 02:10:41,100
Yeah. We'll do the clips when we come back.

1574
02:10:41,100 --> 02:10:43,340
Okay. How's that sound? Okay. We'll do the clips

1575
02:10:43,340 --> 02:10:46,540
when we come back. We'll do the FUs of the Week when we come back as well. And hopefully

1576
02:10:46,540 --> 02:10:50,620
listless, but we're still trying to think of a topic, so you guys start thinking about

1577
02:10:50,620 --> 02:11:00,280

1578
02:11:00,280 --> 02:11:04,280

1579
02:11:30,280 --> 02:11:34,680

1580
02:11:34,680 --> 02:11:38,280
So you can be my, my, my, my darlin'

A little bit of love and gonna feel so fine

1585
02:11:50,680 --> 02:11:53,480
Is it really true that you feel the same way too?

1586
02:11:53,480 --> 02:11:58,280
And hope we'll be together now

1587
02:11:58,280 --> 02:12:06,200
No, but I love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you

1588
02:12:06,200 --> 02:12:12,320
When I'm spitting, thinking of a funny word we call love

1589
02:12:12,320 --> 02:12:18,420
I still won't think of you as it burns My family becomes above

1590
02:12:18,420 --> 02:12:24,360
If you wanna capture me It's as simple as can be

1591
02:12:24,360 --> 02:12:27,480
Mix the letters, writing all you needed

1592
02:12:57,480 --> 02:13:00,480
Come on, baby, do the little motion

1593
02:13:00,480 --> 02:13:04,480
I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now

1594
02:13:04,480 --> 02:13:07,480
Come on, baby, do the little motion

1595
02:13:07,480 --> 02:13:11,480
My little baby's sayin' to you and me

1596
02:13:11,480 --> 02:13:14,480
It's easy on the line if you're A-B-C

1597
02:13:14,480 --> 02:13:19,480
So come on, come on, do the little motion with me

1598
02:13:19,480 --> 02:13:23,480
You gotta swing your head around

1599
02:13:23,480 --> 02:13:25,480
Come on, baby.

1600
02:13:25,480 --> 02:13:26,480
Come on, baby.

1601
02:13:26,480 --> 02:13:28,980
Lose your mind.

1602
02:13:28,980 --> 02:13:31,980

02:17:08,660 --> 02:17:10,660
We forgot to queue up a promo. My bad.

1637
02:17:10,660 --> 02:17:13,660
Here's your promo. My bad. Here you go.

1638
02:17:22,660 --> 02:17:25,660
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

1639
02:17:25,660 --> 02:17:28,660
Because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

1640
02:17:32,660 --> 02:17:34,660
There you go. Sorry about that.

1641
02:17:34,660 --> 02:17:37,660
I was too busy brainstorming for listless.

1642
02:17:37,660 --> 02:17:42,900
We're actually going to allow a guest person to come on List List tonight.

1643
02:17:42,900 --> 02:17:49,780
First person to call in Skype who wants to participate with this topic, Nickelodeon show

1644
02:17:49,780 --> 02:17:54,500
you want brought back tomorrow.

1645
02:17:54,500 --> 02:17:57,460
So we'll take whoever calls in first wanting to play that.

1646
02:17:57,460 --> 02:18:01,420
The way List List works, everybody presents their top three.

1647
02:18:01,420 --> 02:18:05,860
So when you call in, please have three shows that you want to do, ready to go.

1648
02:18:05,860 --> 02:18:10,600
then we'll come up with our list and then we each take one off the list. You

1649
02:18:10,600 --> 02:18:15,760
vote one off and then the chat room ultimately gets the final vote when we

1650
02:18:15,760 --> 02:18:20,840
have a list of eight that would be remaining. So if that makes no sense to

1651
02:18:20,840 --> 02:18:25,320
you don't worry it'll make sense to you as we start to go through it. So let's

02:21:11,540 --> 02:21:14,520

1708
02:21:25,260 --> 02:21:26,580
pete and pete

1709
02:21:26,580 --> 02:21:30,620
cause it was a strange show but it actually worked and the mom had a metal plate in her head

1710
02:21:30,620 --> 02:21:33,640
exactly it reminds me of malcolm in the middle

1711
02:21:33,640 --> 02:21:35,660
is basically i think is what

1712
02:21:35,660 --> 02:21:38,700
became malcolm in the middle so a brief description of pete and pete

1713
02:21:38,700 --> 02:21:42,480
pete and pete was just a story about um two brothers that you know had the same name

1714
02:21:42,480 --> 02:21:43,860
they're both kinda nerdy

1715
02:21:43,860 --> 02:21:49,020
the one brother had a tattoo um that he used to make dance the mother had a metal plate in her head

1716
02:21:49,020 --> 02:21:53,000
and with the radio signals if she can receive real signal it was just such a

1717
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:53,960
weird

1718
02:21:53,960 --> 02:21:57,800
weird show but it worked it was just one of the shows that actually have pretty

1719
02:21:57,800 --> 02:21:59,420
good storyline to it so it worked

1720
02:21:59,420 --> 02:22:03,020
right p p you're never going to say that uh... we've got time to think of another

1721

02:22:46,400 --> 02:22:50,900
my number two one is uh... out of control

1736
02:22:50,900 --> 02:22:54,700
it's just uh... interesting canadian show at the other guy who looked a lot

1737
02:22:54,700 --> 02:22:55,980
like mark summers in it

1738
02:22:55,980 --> 02:22:58,620
and had wrote a name to it

1739
02:22:58,620 --> 02:23:00,540
yet it's all man i do that

1740
02:23:00,540 --> 02:23:02,820
when i was a kid i could do it

1741
02:23:02,820 --> 02:23:04,720
uh... i can't do it anymore

1742
02:23:04,720 --> 02:23:09,100
all the fact that they can i went through puberty

1743
02:23:09,100 --> 02:23:11,100
That was the sound she used to make.

1744
02:23:11,100 --> 02:23:13,100
And she used to do the really funny, jacked-up fairy tales.

1745
02:23:13,100 --> 02:23:15,100
You remember that?

1746
02:23:15,100 --> 02:23:17,100
And that show was just...

1747
02:23:17,100 --> 02:23:19,100
I always came on right after

1748
02:23:19,100 --> 02:23:21,100
you can't do that on television.

1749
02:23:21,100 --> 02:23:23,100
And Dave Coulier cut it out. Hello.

1750
02:23:23,100 --> 02:23:25,100
Hello. Alright.

1751
02:23:25,100 --> 02:23:27,100
And I always was like,

1752
02:23:27,100 --> 02:23:29,100
okay, this show is awesome.

1753
02:23:29,100 --> 02:23:31,100
And so yeah, that gets my number two.

1754
02:23:31,100 --> 02:23:33,100
Doobs!

1755
02:23:33,100 --> 02:23:35,100
And it had the Python-esque animation in it.

1756
02:23:35,100 --> 02:23:37,100
Doobs, your number two pick.

1757
02:23:37,100 --> 02:23:41,100
Um, I'll just say figure it out. That show was awesome.

1758
02:23:41,100 --> 02:23:44,100
A brief description and why it should be brought back.

1759
02:23:44,100 --> 02:23:51,100
It was that game show where like these kids would come up and they'd have talents and like people had to figure out what their talent was by asking them questions and stuff.

1760
02:23:51,100 --> 02:23:54,100
Was that the one that was hosted by Summer Sanders?

1761
02:23:54,100 --> 02:23:55,100
Yeah, her ex- yeah.

1762
02:23:55,100 --> 02:24:04,100
Dude, she went to my high school. She graduated the year before I was a freshman. She came back and spoke like years later and so I always find that funny. I don't know why.

1763
02:24:04,100 --> 02:24:08,100
I know your dreams. You can't reach your goals. I'm living proof.

1764
02:24:34,100 --> 02:24:39,340
wasn't on Nickelodeon, as far as I'm aware. It might have been at one time, but I don't

1765
02:24:39,340 --> 02:24:44,220
think so. So, Are You Afraid of the Dark? But, like the first season of Are You Afraid

1766
02:24:44,220 --> 02:24:48,780
of the Dark, before it got really crappy, you know, that's what... And this show is

1767
02:24:48,780 --> 02:24:51,700
basically, they told them, they were kind of like ghost stories. It's almost like the

1768
02:24:51,700 --> 02:24:56,460
stupid Goosebumps book thing, you know, but it's better.

1769
02:24:56,460 --> 02:24:59,900
I hate that show.

1770
02:24:59,900 --> 02:25:02,780
Well, Doops, you might know which one you want to bump off then, because you get to

1771
02:25:02,780 --> 02:25:03,780
take one off the list.

1772
02:25:03,780 --> 02:25:06,500
Alright well hold on, there could be worse ones, we'll see.

1773
02:25:06,500 --> 02:25:15,020
My number two pick, hello Nick Arcade, hello, hello, come on like everybody, you geek gamers

1774
02:25:15,020 --> 02:25:21,940
all know what Nick Arcade was, who remembers the last stage of Nick Arcade where you could

1775
02:25:21,940 --> 02:25:24,680
be in the video games?

1776
02:25:24,680 --> 02:25:30,940
Now granted, StarCade was leaps and bounds better, but Nick Arcade was still pretty cool.

1777
02:25:30,940 --> 02:25:33,780
So my number two pick is Nick Arcade.

1778
02:25:33,780 --> 02:25:37,980
All right, we're down to the number one pick, Dark Sakura.

1779
02:25:37,980 --> 02:25:40,900
Mine is Danger Mouse.

1780
02:25:40,900 --> 02:25:43,620
I fucking love Danger Mouse.

1781
02:25:43,620 --> 02:25:44,980
Danger Mouse is pretty awesome.

1782
02:25:44,980 --> 02:25:49,180
Because it's all about Penfold.

1783
02:25:49,180 --> 02:25:51,340
I was just watching a tape of Danger Mouse episodes

1784
02:25:51,340 --> 02:25:52,980
I have at my house, and it was the one

1785
02:25:52,980 --> 02:25:55,540
where Penfold gets into the giant chicken feed

1786
02:25:55,540 --> 02:25:56,820
and turns into a giant Penfold.

1787
02:25:59,620 --> 02:26:00,660
That's pretty awesome.

1788
02:26:00,660 --> 02:26:02,400
yeah

1789
02:26:02,400 --> 02:26:06,760
we hold on i have something just for you jamie along

1790
02:26:06,760 --> 02:26:08,860
i'll dammit over

1791
02:26:08,860 --> 02:26:11,120
way to go rob have the volume down the place

1792
02:26:11,120 --> 02:26:12,260
and food

1793
02:26:12,260 --> 02:26:13,460
shot

1794
02:26:13,460 --> 02:26:15,460
uh... just rewrite

1795
02:26:15,460 --> 02:26:17,980
uh... do you have your number one pick

1796
02:26:17,980 --> 02:26:20,660
uh... all that

1797
02:26:20,660 --> 02:26:22,860
uh...

1798
02:26:22,860 --> 02:26:24,500
god

1799
02:26:24,500 --> 02:26:28,500
and i'm sorry i just a brief description and why it should be there

1800
02:26:28,500 --> 02:26:29,740
it was like uh...

1801
02:26:29,740 --> 02:26:33,740
I say MadTV for kids. It was like one of those variety hour type shit.

1802
02:26:33,740 --> 02:26:35,740
It still is.

1803
02:26:35,740 --> 02:26:37,740
Okay, no, no, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Let me see it.

1804
02:26:37,740 --> 02:26:41,740
I want all that to come back before it had all those preppy white people on it.

1805
02:26:45,740 --> 02:26:47,740
He's got a point. He does have a point.

1806
02:26:47,740 --> 02:26:49,740
Yeah.

1807
02:26:49,740 --> 02:26:52,740
Islander. He said he wants it before the preppy white people ruined it.

1808
02:26:52,740 --> 02:26:55,740
Alright. Pretty white? Damn those pretty white people.

1809
02:26:55,740 --> 02:26:57,740
Pretty white people with foam.

1810
02:26:57,740 --> 02:27:14,740
I mean, I know they have Britney Spears' sister on it now. I was like, whoa. I remember the first couple episodes, it was all like, I remember they had that girl from TLC sing for the intro. I was like, ooh, this is like hip-hop type style. Now I hear like, you know.

1811
02:27:14,740 --> 02:27:16,740
It's like, you know what it reminds me of?

1812
02:27:16,740 --> 02:27:17,740
Britney Spears' sister goes on.

1813
02:27:17,740 --> 02:27:23,740
What he's talking about reminds me of Club MMC. Never mind, forget it.

1814
02:27:23,740 --> 02:27:24,740
Oh, God, no.

1815
02:27:24,740 --> 02:27:26,740
You guys seen Mickey Mouse Club?

1816
02:27:26,740 --> 02:27:33,740
Click click click ding. Yeah, but then remember when it was MMC and it was all like, you know, like, we're hip and we're white and dance hip-hop.

1817
02:27:33,740 --> 02:27:36,740
You know, my friend's mom was a Mouseketeer for a day.

1818
02:27:36,740 --> 02:27:37,740
Wow.

1819
02:27:37,740 --> 02:27:41,740
She actually made it back in the 50s to be a Mouseketeer and then her parents let her.

1820
02:27:41,740 --> 02:27:44,740
My mom is Annette Funicello. Okay, no she's not.

1821
02:27:44,740 --> 02:27:46,740
Uh, Loki, your number one pick.

1822
02:27:46,740 --> 02:27:54,740
Well, you know, where can I go with this? I mean, I've got like a bunch of different ideas of what we could do for like, you know, number one here.

1823
02:27:54,740 --> 02:28:01,740
I thought, okay, here's my toss-up here. I thought about Funhaus because, you know, that was an awesome show.

1824
02:28:01,740 --> 02:28:07,740
But no, so I'm gonna go with a better variety show than all that, and that would be Roundhouse.

1825
02:28:09,740 --> 02:28:10,740
Roundhouse.

1826
02:28:10,740 --> 02:28:13,740
Yeah, we saw guys from Roundhouse at E3.

1827
02:28:13,740 --> 02:28:14,740
Yeah, the guy from Roundhouse.

1828
02:28:14,740 --> 02:28:17,740
At least those guys have freaking talent versus, you know, all that where,

1829
02:28:17,740 --> 02:28:22,900
all that work we're trying to be like sarah not live before kids

1830
02:28:22,900 --> 02:28:27,660
and who can forget the guy from roundhouse at e3

1831
02:28:27,660 --> 02:28:33,860
konami konami yo

1832
02:28:33,860 --> 02:28:37,860
yes he was one of the pretty white kids on roundhouse that was him

1833
02:28:37,860 --> 02:28:41,900
alright and uh... shane loved him yeah shane has a crush on him but that's another story

1834
02:28:41,900 --> 02:28:46,660
alright time for my number one pick and there's so many good ones you could choose from

1835
02:28:46,660 --> 02:28:51,960
Man, screw you all for not naming this show sooner, because this is the king of Nickelodeon

1836
02:28:51,960 --> 02:28:52,960
shows.

1837
02:28:52,960 --> 02:28:54,240
There is no doubt about it.

1838
02:28:54,240 --> 02:28:57,120
Without it, you would not have Green Slime, ever.

1839
02:28:57,120 --> 02:28:59,320
You can't do that on television is my number one thing.

1840
02:28:59,320 --> 02:29:00,320
I was saying that for you.

1841
02:29:00,320 --> 02:29:01,320
I knew you were listening.

1842
02:29:01,320 --> 02:29:03,240
I didn't name it because I knew someone else would.

1843
02:29:03,240 --> 02:29:07,360
And besides that, who else but me is going to say Danger Mouse?

1844
02:29:07,360 --> 02:29:08,360
Alright.

1845
02:29:08,360 --> 02:29:11,760
If, if, if you can't do that on television and have been taken by somebody else, I would

1846
02:29:11,760 --> 02:29:12,760
have said Count Duckula.

1847
02:29:12,760 --> 02:29:14,760
We'll have to do that on our show.

1848
02:29:14,760 --> 02:29:17,760
I would have no Count D'ucula without Danger Mouse.

1849
02:29:17,760 --> 02:29:23,760
If our far show's ever live, we are going to do the green slime if you say I don't know.

1850
02:29:23,760 --> 02:29:25,760
Did you ever see the computer one?

1851
02:29:25,760 --> 02:29:27,760
They said, aha, I have a way around.

1852
02:29:27,760 --> 02:29:29,760
That does not compute.

1853
02:29:29,760 --> 02:29:30,760
Gray slime.

1854
02:29:30,760 --> 02:29:33,760
All right, all right, let's...

1855
02:29:33,760 --> 02:29:34,760
I'm being so yuck.

1856
02:29:34,760 --> 02:29:36,760
Yes, and I remember the red slime and blue slime,

1857
02:29:36,760 --> 02:29:39,760
and I remember the episode where you could vote by touching your TV.

1858
02:29:39,760 --> 02:29:41,760
It was... never mind, anyway.

1859
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:42,760
What?

1860
02:29:42,760 --> 02:29:43,760
I'm showing my age here, people.

1861
02:29:43,760 --> 02:29:47,360
Alright, here's the vote-off round. This is gonna be a hard one tonight, you guys.

1862
02:29:47,360 --> 02:29:49,760
You have to take one of these off the list.

1863
02:29:49,760 --> 02:29:52,760
Salute your shorts, rugrats, Pete and Pete,

1864
02:29:52,760 --> 02:29:55,560
Hey, dude, out of control, figure it out,

1865
02:29:55,560 --> 02:29:57,960
Are you afraid of the dark, Nick Arcade,

1866
02:29:57,960 --> 02:30:02,560
Danger Mouse, all that, roundhouse, and you can't do that on television.

1867
02:30:02,560 --> 02:30:04,760
Dark Sakura, what's gotta go?

1868
02:30:04,760 --> 02:30:08,360
Uh, move your big head out of the way.

1869
02:30:08,360 --> 02:30:12,560
Uh...

1870
02:30:12,560 --> 02:30:16,360
are you afraid of the dark are you afraid of the dark it's taken off the

1871
02:30:16,360 --> 02:30:18,500
list by dark sacra

1872
02:30:18,500 --> 02:30:22,360
in you knew the dooms was going to take it off so you just give them a free pick

1873
02:30:22,360 --> 02:30:26,040
he and i think you could pick in those two all right dudes which one's gonna

1874
02:30:26,040 --> 02:30:27,780
come off

1875
02:30:27,780 --> 02:30:29,780
uh... he did

1876
02:30:29,780 --> 02:30:33,800
are you bastard i hate it comes out of it is because uh... i i think

1877
02:30:33,800 --> 02:30:35,940
to your children anything to happen on that show

1878
02:30:35,940 --> 02:30:39,320
so i was going to say how old are you because your pics are more new school

1879
02:30:39,320 --> 02:30:44,220
Nickelodeon in my eyes. Well, I'm actually fourteen, but I didn't really watch Nickelodeon

1880
02:30:44,220 --> 02:30:50,580
much. You know what? F you, okay? F you guys. Rob, actually, it was pointed out to me that

1881
02:30:50,580 --> 02:30:57,580
not a one of us mentioned Invader Zim. Ah, dammit! Oh, Loki. I say we have a unanimous

1882
02:30:58,740 --> 02:31:04,320
vote to put Invader Zim on the list. I. All of us vote. Fine, fine. We'll put Invader

1883
02:31:04,320 --> 02:31:06,320
Am I?

1884
02:31:06,320 --> 02:31:08,320
God, I'm so bad.

1885
02:31:08,320 --> 02:31:09,320
Now that's new school, Nickelodeon.

1886
02:31:09,320 --> 02:31:11,320
Alright, Loki, take one of these off the list.

1887
02:31:11,320 --> 02:31:18,320
Dammit, you know, they took off my Hey Dude because I was gonna say that show bit compared to, you know, like, say, Smoother Shorts.

1888
02:31:18,320 --> 02:31:28,320
But I'm gonna take off Rugrats because, I mean, that used to be on, was it, you know, uh, Nick Jr., and that's where it needs to stay, is Nick Jr.

1889
02:31:28,320 --> 02:31:31,320
It used to be back there by Pinwheel.

1890
02:31:31,320 --> 02:31:32,320
Spinning around.

1891
02:31:32,320 --> 02:31:41,320
My turn, huh? I'm gonna have to take off, um... I'm gonna take off Roundhouse. I just...

1892
02:31:41,320 --> 02:31:45,320
There's too many sketch comedy shows on Nickelodeon.

1893
02:31:45,320 --> 02:31:46,320
You have good taste.

1894
02:31:46,320 --> 02:31:48,320
Nah, I do. I have excellent taste. You can't tell this is better.

1895
02:31:48,320 --> 02:31:51,320
Please, we didn't put What Would You Do on that stupid...

1896
02:31:51,320 --> 02:31:56,320
Nobody said Double Dare, but I guess they have a new version of Double Dare. Lots of shows not named.

1897
02:31:56,320 --> 02:32:00,080
All right, here it is, the list that you guys can vote on.

1898
02:32:00,080 --> 02:32:02,920
Salute your shorts, Pete and Pete, out of,

1899
02:32:02,920 --> 02:32:05,320
Dubes, what the hell are you doing over there?

1900
02:32:05,320 --> 02:32:07,160
I don't know, my thing's just messing up, sorry.

1901
02:32:07,160 --> 02:32:08,000
All right, that's all right.

1902
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:09,080
Put out the plastic cover.

1903
02:32:09,080 --> 02:32:11,880
Salute your shorts, Pete and Pete, out of control,

1904
02:32:11,880 --> 02:32:15,920
figure it out, Nick Arcade, Danger Mouse, all that.

1905
02:32:15,920 --> 02:32:19,360
You can't do that on television and Invader Zim.

1906
02:32:19,360 --> 02:32:22,280
You guys can send a vote, you get to vote for one.

1907
02:32:22,280 --> 02:32:24,720
Send a private message to Sky in the chatroom

1908
02:32:24,720 --> 02:32:29,660
with your vote. Some of the ones we missed, you guys, according to the chatroom. Count

1909
02:32:29,660 --> 02:32:34,040
Duckula, Ren and Stimpy. That's a big one.

1910
02:32:34,040 --> 02:32:38,840
Actually, I think Vader Zim should come off the list, because while it's still, it is

1911
02:32:38,840 --> 02:32:41,000
a cancelled show, they still re-run it.

1912
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,040
I'm saying no. We already put them there.

1913
02:32:43,040 --> 02:32:45,200
It should still be on the list.

1914
02:32:45,200 --> 02:32:46,540
Amanda's show?

1915
02:32:46,540 --> 02:32:48,640
No. Clarissa explains it all.

1916
02:32:48,640 --> 02:32:50,320
Clarissa explains it all? Thank you.

1917
02:32:50,320 --> 02:32:53,800
I liked Clarissa explains it all, because of the guy who came in through the window

1918
02:32:53,800 --> 02:33:00,800
and tell me about sexuality if you didn't explain it all but

1919
02:33:01,640 --> 02:33:04,000
but i would rather pictures of alex mac

1920
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:05,200

1921
02:33:05,200 --> 02:33:06,320

rockaway modern life that they really think boobs all the time but it's good

1937
02:33:49,280 --> 02:33:59,280
You know Rocko's Modern Life? The characters from Rocko is supposed to have a cameo in the Spongebob movie, but I don't remember seeing them.

1938
02:33:59,280 --> 02:34:02,280
Fucking Spongebob Squarepants, but again and again, that's all.

1939
02:34:02,280 --> 02:34:03,280
Thank God!

1940
02:34:03,280 --> 02:34:05,280
It's still on. That's all Nickelodeon is now.

1941
02:34:05,280 --> 02:34:08,280
I hate Spongebob.

1942
02:34:08,280 --> 02:34:11,280
Dude, Spongebob is not that bad.

1943
02:34:11,280 --> 02:34:13,280
No, technically all that is still on there too.

1944
02:34:13,280 --> 02:34:14,280
Is it?

1945
02:34:14,280 --> 02:34:16,280
Yeah, it's still on there.

1946
02:34:16,280 --> 02:34:19,580
Because now that one of the guys from it actually is on Saturday Night Live, they're like,

1947
02:34:19,580 --> 02:34:21,580
Oh, we're famous now.

1948
02:34:21,580 --> 02:34:22,580
Yeah.

1949
02:34:22,580 --> 02:34:23,580
So.

1950
02:34:23,580 --> 02:34:24,580
Whatever.

1951
02:34:24,580 --> 02:34:27,120
Alright, well we'll see how the chat room votes there.

1952
02:34:27,120 --> 02:34:31,240
So again, Salute Your Shorts, Pete and Pete, Out of Control, Figure It Out, Nick Arcade,

1953
02:34:31,240 --> 02:34:32,860
Danger Mouse, all that.

1954
02:34:32,860 --> 02:34:35,040
You can't do that on television and Invader Zim.

1955
02:34:35,040 --> 02:34:38,500
We will find out your top three choices for...

1956
02:34:38,500 --> 02:34:39,500
Legend of the Hidden Temple.

1957
02:34:39,500 --> 02:34:40,500
Guts.

1958
02:34:40,500 --> 02:34:41,500
I know.

1959
02:34:41,500 --> 02:34:43,500
Legend of the Hidden Temple is freaking awesome.

1960
02:34:43,500 --> 02:34:45,500
And Guts was on my list.

1961
02:34:45,500 --> 02:34:49,500
But I took it off in favor of, uh, of whatever the first one was.

1962
02:34:49,500 --> 02:34:50,500
Guts was retarded.

1963
02:34:50,500 --> 02:34:52,500
Well, Guts was a good idea.

1964
02:34:52,500 --> 02:34:55,500
I'll just remember the referee that they had on the show, because-

1965
02:34:55,500 --> 02:34:57,500
We have all these veggie cores, what are we gonna do with them?

1966
02:34:57,500 --> 02:34:59,500
Let's play every game with them.

1967
02:34:59,500 --> 02:35:00,500
The Agrocrag.

1968
02:35:00,500 --> 02:35:01,500
Agrocrag?

1969
02:35:01,500 --> 02:35:05,500
Let's climb up the big glowing purple hunk of plastic.

1970
02:35:05,500 --> 02:35:07,500
Uh oh, I got aggroed by the crag.

1971
02:35:07,500 --> 02:35:11,500
You lost ten minutes because you didn't hit the little charger thing.

1972
02:35:11,500 --> 02:35:12,500
You suck.

1973
02:35:12,500 --> 02:35:13,500
Alright, great.

1974
02:35:13,500 --> 02:35:14,500
Time to go back to kindergarten.

1975
02:35:14,500 --> 02:35:20,500
Hurry up and get your votes in, kids. We gotta get this wrapped up so we can get into the FUs of the week, okay?

1976
02:35:20,500 --> 02:35:29,500
So in this break, I think what we'll do, just a couple quick ones. We're gonna do some third mix songs, I think.

1977
02:35:29,500 --> 02:35:30,500
Because I want to play Wonderland.

1978
02:35:30,500 --> 02:35:31,500
And Neon FM.

1979
02:35:31,500 --> 02:35:34,500
Oh, the Neon FM. We'll get to that, too. I promise we will.

1980
02:35:34,500 --> 02:35:34,500
Uh-huh.

1981
02:35:34,500 --> 02:35:39,500
All right. We'll get to that. So let's get those votes in real quick because we're gonna get to the FUs of the week.

1982
02:35:39,500 --> 02:35:43,500
Don't send your FUs just yet, though, because we gotta get the votes for Listless out of the way first.

1983
02:35:43,500 --> 02:35:46,740
out of the way first so we'll be back after this quick break with more Orange

1984
02:35:46,740 --> 02:35:53,740
launch radio.

1985
02:36:16,740 --> 02:36:19,940
is smooth and easy like, so we might get hyped to hear tonight.

1986
02:36:19,940 --> 02:36:22,740
Be nice, relax, and see for the back, if you ain't with that,

1987
02:36:22,740 --> 02:36:24,740
I'ma have to attack you with a bad rap.

1988
02:36:24,740 --> 02:36:27,740
That could mess with my whoops if they dash for no sauce, no crap.

1989
02:36:27,740 --> 02:36:31,740
Giving a little bit of heart and soul as we do it till you in your ear hole, huh?

1990
02:36:31,740 --> 02:36:35,740
I ain't going out like a sucka, and if you think so, boy, then puff up.

1991
02:36:35,740 --> 02:36:38,740
Puff the chips up out of this lyric and slow the mic word up.

1992
02:36:38,740 --> 02:36:40,740
This groove is set to soothe you.

1993
02:36:40,740 --> 02:36:42,740
We're party people now, it's time to do it

1994
02:37:42,740 --> 02:37:44,740
Oh

1995
02:38:42,740 --> 02:38:49,740
Okay, technically this next song is from 2nd Mix, but Jamie begged.

1996
02:38:49,740 --> 02:38:51,740
I cried

1997
02:39:19,740 --> 02:39:29,740
Cause when we dance together, you're like a dream come true

1998
02:39:29,740 --> 02:39:37,740
I feel so beautiful, hot inside, it's all just a view

1999
02:39:37,740 --> 02:39:43,740
Love, I just gotta have it, I believe in love

2000
02:39:43,740 --> 02:40:09,740
I can't be without it. Come to me and make your confession. Love, come let it go. Love, like it's got a habit I believe in. Love, I can't be without it. Come to me and make your confession. Love, come let it go.

2001
02:40:13,740 --> 02:40:20,740
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

2002
02:40:43,740 --> 02:40:47,820
Max. Alright, let's, uh, you want to find out tonight's listless winners?

2003
02:40:47,820 --> 02:40:53,060
We did the votes. Yes, K, thanks. This was a toughie. We had a lot of votes kind of

2004
02:40:53,060 --> 02:40:56,240
spread out tonight. Everybody loves Nickelodeon, so I'm glad we could

2005
02:40:56,240 --> 02:40:59,740
talk about it here. Nobody loves MTV, though. Yeah, nobody.

2006
02:40:59,740 --> 02:41:04,400
Uh, seriously, they were, well, I actually watched a little bit of MTV for the first

2007
02:41:04,400 --> 02:41:05,460
time in a long time

2008
02:41:05,460 --> 02:41:08,620
yesterday. There was a marathon of Next,

2009
02:41:08,620 --> 02:41:13,500
which is some type of speed dating show. It's awful. Yeah, I remember. I've seen that show.

2010
02:41:13,500 --> 02:41:17,900
What about they also had a marathon yesterday? I thought of true life. I

2011
02:41:18,500 --> 02:41:23,220
Don't know. I don't know. I don't watch TV. So I have no idea what the fuck either of you were talking about

2012
02:41:23,220 --> 02:41:28,140
All right, listen, it's the one it's like, you know true life. I'm a prostitute or true life, you know

2013
02:41:28,140 --> 02:41:31,540
I'm addicted to speed or you know, they have like usually it's a you know

2014
02:41:31,540 --> 02:41:35,260
It's a drama like one of those afternoon things true life. I hump small boys

2015
02:41:36,340 --> 02:41:38,340
Bad one true life. I'm a furry

2016
02:41:38,340 --> 02:41:42,340
Oh my god, no, I'd have to see that, because that would be hilarious.

2017
02:41:42,340 --> 02:41:44,340
True, they honestly had that, it was great.

2018
02:41:44,340 --> 02:41:47,340
True Life is actually one of the few decent series they have now, I think.

2019
02:41:47,340 --> 02:41:51,340
But, like, all these, like, you know what my friends are into? I don't get this at all.

2020
02:41:51,340 --> 02:41:56,340
They don't watch the real world, they don't watch Road Rules, but what they do watch is that fucking, like, Inferno show.

2021
02:41:56,340 --> 02:42:00,340
Where it's, like, real world meets Road Rules on, I don't know, whatever.

2022
02:42:00,340 --> 02:42:03,340
Isn't, like, MTV all reality shows nowadays now?

2023
02:42:03,340 --> 02:42:05,340
Pretty much. It's MTV.

2024
02:42:05,340 --> 02:42:12,260
MTV. See, I only know three shows on MTV from back in the day, so.

2025
02:42:12,260 --> 02:42:19,180
Yeah, I remember Remote Control, which was like the best show ever.

2026
02:42:19,180 --> 02:42:21,740
And Adam Curry, who is our podcasting hero.

2027
02:42:21,740 --> 02:42:30,420
The only one I remember was, of course, Singled Out, because it had What's Your Face, and

2028
02:42:30,420 --> 02:42:34,420
And of course, you have some bad.

2029
02:42:34,420 --> 02:42:38,420
Yeah, liquid television.

2030
02:42:38,420 --> 02:42:40,420
And I remember Pauly Shore.

2031
02:42:40,420 --> 02:42:42,420
You know that Aeon Flux movie is coming out next year?

2032
02:42:42,420 --> 02:42:43,420
Or is it this year?

2033
02:42:43,420 --> 02:42:45,420
I think I'm going to see that.

2034
02:42:45,420 --> 02:42:46,420
It looks kind of, I don't know.

2035
02:42:46,420 --> 02:42:47,420
I think it's going to be good.

2036
02:42:47,420 --> 02:42:51,420
However, there's one show that I do watch, sort of.

2037
02:42:51,420 --> 02:42:54,420
My Guilty Pleasure on TV is Pimp My Ride.

2038
02:42:54,420 --> 02:42:57,420
Because I want to take my mom's ice cream truck

2039
02:42:57,420 --> 02:43:02,300
and see what they can do with that they would love

2040
02:43:02,300 --> 02:43:05,860
they love crap like that you know where it's just like something weird um

2041
02:43:05,860 --> 02:43:10,020
you know my guilty I'm actually gonna go see a on flux you know but my guilty

2042
02:43:10,020 --> 02:43:11,500
pleasure movie of this year

2043
02:43:11,500 --> 02:43:15,060
on the which is an MTV movie actually is gonna be roll bounce

2044
02:43:15,060 --> 02:43:18,140
the hell's that roll bounce is a movie

2045
02:43:18,140 --> 02:43:21,980
set in the seventies during the roller disco era

2046
02:43:21,980 --> 02:43:25,460
and it's actually it I remember all that basically

2047
02:43:25,460 --> 02:43:30,040
It is, it is, um, you got served on Rulerskate.

2048
02:43:30,040 --> 02:43:31,040
Alright, look.

2049
02:43:31,040 --> 02:43:37,600
I need to see that, okay, no, my fucking, look people, we'll do the MTV show they need

2050
02:43:37,600 --> 02:43:40,960
to bring back at a later date, but we gotta get rid of tonight's listless first.

2051
02:43:40,960 --> 02:43:43,960
Check out the trailer though, it's online on Apple, check it out.

2052
02:43:43,960 --> 02:43:48,500
Alright, let's do this, uh, top three listless tonight Nickelodeon show they should bring

2053
02:43:48,500 --> 02:43:54,480
back, number third, number three, you can't, number third, you can't do that on television

2054
02:44:24,480 --> 02:44:28,880
I'm not going to be watching it. It's not needing Nick Classic.

2055
02:44:28,880 --> 02:44:32,880
Honestly, like, the old school shows need to just run the reruns. Who cares?

2056
02:44:32,880 --> 02:44:36,480
Alright, let's get on to tonight's FUs or we're going to run out of time here.

2057
02:44:36,480 --> 02:44:39,480
So, Jamie, why do we do the FUs of the week every single week?

2058
02:44:39,480 --> 02:44:45,480
Because I hate everybody and everything and I just need to slit my wrists.

2059
02:44:45,480 --> 02:44:49,480
I'll email you.

2060
02:44:49,480 --> 02:44:59,920
Fuck insurance companies, I want my god damn car you bitches.

2061
02:44:59,920 --> 02:45:09,000
Okay I have been, oh hi Barry, I have been without a car, okay get this, I've been without

2062

2063
02:45:14,540 --> 02:45:15,540
I hate it!

2064
02:45:15,540 --> 02:45:18,540
I drove julie's car yesterday and my mother at birth, IT'S SUCKED

2065
02:45:18,540 --> 02:45:19,540
It's like the contestant says

02:45:19,540 --> 02:45:23,540
So, I need a car this week

2067
02:45:23,540 --> 02:45:29,540

So, I don't care when the fuck you mailed it

02:45:32,540 --> 02:45:35,540
You should have sent that shit Federal Express to my door

Hand delivered by, you know, young boys dressed in, you know, old pageboy livery or something, I don't know

2071
02:45:42,540 --> 02:45:48,660

2073
02:45:53,700 --> 02:46:01,260
Loki I only have two the first one is this fucking headache that's been on my

2074
02:46:01,260 --> 02:46:06,420
head for two days I say on my head because it switched from the right side

2075
02:46:06,420 --> 02:46:12,500
to the left side last night so now that whatever parasite it is in my head is on

2076
02:46:12,500 --> 02:46:17,000
my left side and it still hurts and it's the Sunday headache and I don't know why

2077
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:22,120
I can't get rid of it anyways and the second thing goes to well actually I

2078
02:46:22,120 --> 02:46:26,280

2079
02:46:26,280 --> 02:46:31,200
they're still crashing and they should fix this months ago and I don't know why

2080
02:46:31,200 --> 02:46:35,760
they can't seem to fend off a stupid DNS attack it's just a DNS attack come on

2081
02:46:35,760 --> 02:46:40,440
people you know fix it and the third goes to the phone company for some

2082
02:46:40,440 --> 02:46:45,440
for some reason charging me $80 when they should be charging me $40 for the first time.

2083
02:46:45,440 --> 02:46:54,440
They're saying that I'm like, there's some non, uh, some sort of charges that are non, you know, standard charges or whatever, like 32 bucks.

2084
02:46:54,440 --> 02:47:00,440
I'm like, what the hell is this? I don't have any extra services, so I have to call them and find out what that is tomorrow.

2085
02:47:00,440 --> 02:47:02,440
So, that's it.

2086
02:47:02,440 --> 02:47:14,580
I'm going to give an F you to missing deadlines at work because that really sucks.

2087
02:47:14,580 --> 02:47:19,040
I want to give an F you to earwax because apparently I had a really bad build up of

2088
02:47:19,040 --> 02:47:20,880
earwax in one of my ears.

2089
02:47:20,880 --> 02:47:23,440
No look this is a totally normal thing okay y'all get it.

2090
02:47:23,440 --> 02:47:28,320
Alright I had a really bad build up and I actually lost hearing in my right ear a couple

2091
02:47:28,320 --> 02:47:30,240
days ago and I was totally freaked out.

2092
02:47:30,240 --> 02:47:34,440
like I was like oh my god I'm gonna be deaf and I do radio as a hobby I'm gonna

2093
02:47:34,440 --> 02:47:37,080
be screwed for the rest of my life I'll never be able to play DDR again that's

2094
02:47:37,080 --> 02:47:40,280
why I have one of those cool you know fountain pen things I actually just

2095
02:47:40,280 --> 02:47:45,200
pulled the pen part down and no I work I was trying to clean my ear with a q-tip

2096
02:47:45,200 --> 02:47:49,400
like you know like a normal sanitary person would do that's actually very bad

2097
02:47:49,400 --> 02:47:53,200
for you because what I did is I actually pushed the wax in further with a q-tip

2098
02:47:53,200 --> 02:47:56,500
and made myself lose hearing yeah don't push it in you got to go around well

2099
02:47:56,500 --> 02:48:01,320
that's what I was trying to do but somehow I pushed it in. So anyway, kids, if you have

2100
02:48:01,320 --> 02:48:04,740
your wax filled up, go to the store and get the liquid that you put in your ear because

2101
02:48:04,740 --> 02:48:12,460
that's the only way you're going to do it. Don't use a Q-tip. Swim in a pool, folks.

2102
02:48:12,460 --> 02:48:17,320
And I guess that's it. So an F.U. to $15 co-pays to get your earwax removed. That's pretty

2103
02:48:17,320 --> 02:48:24,560
bad. All right, let's go to Islander. F.U. to airborne viruses.

2104
02:48:24,560 --> 02:48:31,560
Why can't more diseases be like, I don't know, HIV?

2105
02:48:31,560 --> 02:48:38,560
Where it's like, you know, you know what you have to do to get it, so if you just avoid that, you won't get it?

2106
02:48:38,560 --> 02:48:44,560
No, the flu has to be something you can just give to someone by talking to them.

2107
02:48:44,560 --> 02:48:45,560
Dammit.

2108
02:48:48,560 --> 02:48:49,560
That's pretty much it.

2109
02:48:49,560 --> 02:48:53,560
Alright, thank god you can't catch Ugly.

2110
02:48:57,560 --> 02:49:01,560
OMG Tits Boobs.

2111
02:49:01,560 --> 02:49:03,560
Awesome.

2112
02:49:03,560 --> 02:49:05,560
You took my suggestion.

2113
02:49:05,560 --> 02:49:06,560
Is that Doobs?

2114
02:49:06,560 --> 02:49:07,560
Yes, it's Doobs.

2115
02:49:07,560 --> 02:49:09,560
OMG Tits Boobs.

2116
02:49:09,560 --> 02:49:15,560

2118
02:49:19,360 --> 02:49:21,300

02:49:44,720 --> 02:49:49,080

02:50:10,440 --> 02:50:13,640
illusion says F you to my uncle's wife's

2136
02:50:13,640 --> 02:50:17,040
gay brother that is covering it up by marrying a woman that is so into herself

2137
02:50:17,040 --> 02:50:18,800
that you won't need any love for herself

2138
02:50:18,800 --> 02:50:19,920

2139
02:50:19,920 --> 02:50:20,920

to figure that one out

2141
02:50:21,760 --> 02:50:25,480
thirtieth birthday party that was full of boring rich people that only played corny

2142
02:50:25,480 --> 02:50:26,440
songs like

2143
02:50:26,440 --> 02:50:29,520
this song is for all the girls or whatever it was

2144
02:50:29,520 --> 02:50:32,500
if you're not being able to go to karaoke because of this party

2145
02:50:32,500 --> 02:50:35,360
and at the end of the weekend being boring because of nothing to do this

2146
02:50:35,360 --> 02:50:36,080
weekend

2147
02:50:36,080 --> 02:50:39,280

2153
02:50:56,660 --> 02:51:00,380
you've got to be kidding

2154
02:51:00,380 --> 02:51:01,880

02:51:01,880 --> 02:51:06,020
they could fit that in there while you while you while other kids

2156
02:51:06,020 --> 02:51:08,940
uh... what the hell would you think

2157
02:51:08,940 --> 02:51:12,360
you've got to make up to it there's people that think the cd-rom is a copy

2159
02:51:16,940 --> 02:51:20,380

2161
02:51:23,020 --> 02:51:24,660

2162
02:51:24,660 --> 02:51:27,000
mmm better or something

2163
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:30,400
here the middle of the place

2164
02:51:30,400 --> 02:51:32,820
go go play go blow up these balloons

2165
02:51:32,820 --> 02:51:37,420
uh... haru chances at the altar makes an ultimate to for having such horrible

2166
02:51:37,420 --> 02:51:42,420
I disagree but whatever. You know actually some girl got AIDS from that. Stop it.

2167
02:51:42,420 --> 02:51:45,420
And for their not having more Konami Bimani games in the U.S.

2168
02:51:45,420 --> 02:51:51,420
Suguru-chan says last F.U. for my boyfriend using me and cosplay.

2169
02:51:51,420 --> 02:51:59,420
Darklionxvi says F.U. to David Williams for calling my pocket aces with his 6-7 of clubs on the World Series of Poker.

2170
02:51:59,420 --> 02:52:05,420
No limit tourney. The flop came 8-5-9 of clubs for the straight flush eliminating me in the process.

2171
02:52:05,420 --> 02:52:11,500
f you to myself for playing one more lovely another forgetting to turn off hard mode mode oops and

2172
02:52:13,140 --> 02:52:17,040
lastly a guana girl says f you to bad car batteries and

2173
02:52:17,500 --> 02:52:22,300
Corrosion that causes Jessica to be stuck out in the heat and wind for seven and a half hours

2174
02:52:23,140 --> 02:52:25,140
ouch

2175
02:52:26,340 --> 02:52:29,620
Look on the bright side though at least you didn't have a sign to twirl

2176
02:52:29,940 --> 02:52:34,820
Because I don't get the sign twirlers like have you ever seen those guys that stand out there in the middle of the road?

2177
02:52:34,820 --> 02:52:38,900
twirling the signs. I get confused where they want me to go. Is it up in the air? Is it

2178
02:52:38,900 --> 02:52:42,660
to the left? Is it to the right? They keep spinning that shit around. What a sucky job

2179
02:52:42,660 --> 02:52:45,540
to have, because then you really are standing out in the sun for seven and a half hours.

2180
02:52:45,540 --> 02:52:48,900
I mean, granted, at least you get to get paid for it and you listen to music. Maybe strippers

2181
02:52:48,900 --> 02:52:52,980
doing that shit. Then I go to wherever they want me to go. That's a great idea. When they

2182
02:52:52,980 --> 02:52:57,380
open up hooters here in Sacramento. Which, what are we doing? They have had commercials.

2183
02:52:57,380 --> 02:53:03,580
I have seen commercials on VH1, advertising, become a hooter girl. I was like, it's coming.

2184
02:53:03,580 --> 02:53:05,580
It's coming! Soon!

2185
02:53:05,580 --> 02:53:09,580
We are like, what, the last city in the nation to get a Hooters.

2186
02:53:09,580 --> 02:53:12,580
Seriously, LA has five billion.

2187
02:53:12,580 --> 02:53:16,580
I think Sacramento is the last city in the nation, big city, to get a Hooters.

2188
02:53:16,580 --> 02:53:17,580
We're finally getting one.

2189
02:53:17,580 --> 02:53:20,580
We're also getting a Logan's Roadhouse, which also makes me happy.

2190
02:53:20,580 --> 02:53:21,580
Alright.

2191
02:53:21,580 --> 02:53:27,580
Somebody in the chat room is yelling at me because they are assigned to our lives.

2192
02:53:27,580 --> 02:53:31,580
You know, there's actually someone down the street from where I live

2193
02:53:31,580 --> 02:53:38,000
who does this for a living straight up dancing Dan if he doesn't have a gig

2194
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:44,840
going his sign says hire me Wow I in this guy this dude says 1150 an hour is

2195
02:53:44,840 --> 02:53:50,180
what he makes doing that I know oh well I mean like we're just doing that now I

2196
02:53:50,180 --> 02:53:55,200
understand how to put Nellie on the corner man cuz she's not making that

2197
02:53:55,200 --> 02:53:58,520
kind of money you are gonna put your fiance on the corner have her work the

2198
02:53:58,520 --> 02:54:03,480
corner. Seriously, that's some good money there. That's awesome. Plus she's bitching

2199
02:54:03,480 --> 02:54:13,480
about not having a tan. There you go. That's a twofer. You're a bastard. Who would want

2200
02:54:13,480 --> 02:54:22,360
to marry you? Alright, we promised some clips from Neon FM and we've made you wait long

2201
02:54:22,360 --> 02:54:27,280
enough, so here they are. Here's some clips from the new dance game, Neon FM. Let's listen

2202
02:54:27,280 --> 02:54:49,200
of some of these, see what we think. 1981. Sounds like a lot of Naoki songs I've heard

2203
02:54:49,200 --> 02:54:53,080
before, but that's kind of cute that they invoke that. So, what do you guys think, real

2204
02:54:53,080 --> 02:55:17,160
quickly. I don't know what the point of 1981 is. Whatever. Bride and Dream. Dude it's like

2205
02:55:17,160 --> 02:55:20,080
An Ayumi Tomisaki techno song.

2206
02:55:20,080 --> 02:55:22,520
Time to drop to E and go to a rave or something.

2207
02:55:22,520 --> 02:55:26,800
I have heard that whole song before, I remember, somewhere, and it's really good.

2208
02:55:26,800 --> 02:55:29,800
That's kinda hot, I like that. Bring the beat back.

2209
02:55:43,080 --> 02:55:45,520
Wow, that bitch is off-key.

2210
02:55:45,520 --> 02:55:46,880
Is it just me?

2211
02:55:46,880 --> 02:55:53,880
Yes, well, once she's off-key, and I think they, for me, for that song to be cool, they need to lose, like, that, like, techno-ish aspect.

2212
02:55:53,880 --> 02:55:57,880
It's okay. I'm actually liking this so far, though. This isn't bad. I like this.

2213
02:55:57,880 --> 02:55:58,880
Can you feel the music?

2214
02:55:58,880 --> 02:56:02,880
Can you feel the music?

2215
02:56:02,880 --> 02:56:06,880
Can you feel the music?

2216
02:56:06,880 --> 02:56:10,880
Can you feel the music?

2217
02:56:10,880 --> 02:56:14,880
Can you feel the music?

2218
02:56:14,880 --> 02:56:20,880
Can you feel the music? I kinda like that. Do you have an artist list up so we can tell you who the artists for these songs are?

2219
02:56:20,880 --> 02:56:24,880
Go to the site so we can get some of that, because I only have the song titles here. You like that one, Dark Sucker?

2220
02:56:24,880 --> 02:56:26,880
Yeah, I do like that one a whole bunch.

2221
02:56:26,880 --> 02:56:28,880
Alright, Complete Shot.

2222
02:56:34,880 --> 02:56:36,880
Oh yeah, we heard this one earlier. That's alright.

2223
02:56:36,880 --> 02:56:38,880
Wait, what was that song again?

2224
02:56:38,880 --> 02:56:39,880
Complete Shot.

2225
02:56:39,880 --> 02:56:40,880
No, the one before that.

2226
02:56:40,880 --> 02:56:41,880
Can you feel the music?

2227
02:56:41,880 --> 02:56:46,600

2229
02:56:53,240 --> 02:56:55,720
we gotta get through this we're running out of show control

2230
02:56:55,720 --> 02:57:14,720
I'm in control of your mind I'm in control of the air that you breathe

2231
02:57:14,720 --> 02:57:19,720
I'm in control of the air that you breathe

2232
02:57:19,720 --> 02:57:21,720
Is that the Alien 6-3?

2233
02:57:21,720 --> 02:57:23,720
No, no, no, that's...

2234
02:57:23,720 --> 02:57:25,720
Damn, I've heard of that.

2235
02:57:25,720 --> 02:57:27,720
The Nine.

2236
02:57:27,720 --> 02:57:29,720
It's from...

2237
02:57:29,720 --> 02:57:31,720
It's a different drum song.

2238
02:57:31,720 --> 02:57:33,720
You can actually get the whole song on Amazon for free.

2239
02:57:33,720 --> 02:57:35,720
Because I know, listen to that.

2240
02:57:35,720 --> 02:57:37,720
The Nine, you're right, that's it.

Thomas Howard.

2243
02:57:41,720 --> 02:57:43,720
Thomas Howard.

2244
02:57:43,720 --> 02:57:45,720
Yay, a ballad.

nation's world

2261
02:58:39,620 --> 02:58:46,620
I hate this song.

2262
02:58:46,900 --> 02:58:48,980
This song came out a long time ago.

2263
02:58:48,980 --> 02:58:53,900
Again, we're playing clips from new songs on Neon FM which are available on Neon FM's website, yes?

2264
02:58:53,900 --> 02:58:57,540
It's actually a thread in Be My Own Cell.

2265
02:58:57,540 --> 02:59:04,540
Sounds good. Hi-G again with Play 240.

2266
02:59:04,540 --> 02:59:23,540
DJ Potato featuring THL, this is Put Her In Reverse.

2267
02:59:23,540 --> 02:59:24,540
What?

2268
02:59:24,540 --> 02:59:26,540
I feel like I should be waving my hands in a para-para motion.

2269
02:59:26,540 --> 02:59:27,540
Seriously.

2270
02:59:27,540 --> 02:59:28,640
sexy sexy sexy

2271
02:59:28,640 --> 02:59:35,640
uh... rhinestone cowboy

2272
02:59:40,540 --> 02:59:43,660
that's ricky and daz that's actually kind of a commercially known song

2273
02:59:43,660 --> 02:59:48,060
yeah ricky and daz the space cats you can go to space cats with a k

2274
02:59:48,060 --> 02:59:49,060
uh... dot com

2275
02:59:49,060 --> 02:59:53,300
oh so that's why it sounds like bus stop because those are the singers from bus stop

2276
02:59:53,300 --> 02:59:54,780
aha

2277
02:59:54,780 --> 03:00:01,780
Gotcha! That's why. You guys know this one if you've ever played frequency.

2278
03:00:02,740 --> 03:00:09,420
Dude, freeze pop rocks! You shut up. That was the highest genius. I like some freeze pop, I just didn't care for that freeze pop song.

2279
03:00:09,420 --> 03:00:11,040
uh... deejays

2280
03:00:11,040 --> 03:00:18,040
Miami I don't know deejays and Miami same thing so it was skyward

2281
03:00:26,420 --> 03:00:27,860
not bad not bad

2282
03:00:27,860 --> 03:00:29,860
Freezepop, again, Stakeout.

2283
03:00:40,860 --> 03:00:43,860
That's the song that almost got retired in the cage match,

2284
03:00:43,860 --> 03:00:47,860
but Jamie decided in a tie vote its fourth week to go for the other song.

2285
03:00:48,860 --> 03:00:52,860
Sorry, that much Freezepop every so often makes my head want to go floaty.

2286
03:00:52,860 --> 03:00:54,860
You'll love this. Super Sproat is another song.

2287
03:00:54,860 --> 03:01:17,860
song. DJ Potato with Tune In. This is a theme song also. I don't know for a theme song,

2288
03:01:17,860 --> 03:01:21,260
that's a little weird. Well they had a different, it's like a different version of that or cut

2289
03:01:21,260 --> 03:01:26,420
of that, but actually it was really good when I saw the preview video.

2290
03:01:26,420 --> 03:01:33,580
Alien number 613, You Got The City.

2291
03:01:33,580 --> 03:01:36,780
I'm digging this one, it makes me think of Chemical Love from Busta Move.

2292
03:01:36,780 --> 03:01:41,500
I am really digging that.

2293
03:01:41,500 --> 03:01:48,500
lastly zap remix

2294
03:02:00,940 --> 03:02:02,620
burning heat sort of feel to it

2295
03:02:02,620 --> 03:02:06,700
kinda weird wasn't that the same artist that did the great gianna

2296
03:02:06,700 --> 03:02:08,780
sisters or whatever the

2297
03:02:08,780 --> 03:02:15,780
the remix of that on overclock to that sounds awfully similar to no idea

2298
03:02:16,400 --> 03:02:18,200
whatever but it is a good start

2299
03:02:18,200 --> 03:02:21,400
concert music why you know what that thought i you know it just

2300
03:02:21,400 --> 03:02:26,360
keeps me pretty uh... excited about that i was excited but i'm looking forward to

2301
03:02:26,360 --> 03:02:29,440
that i'm looking forward to at least it's something fresh let me put it that

2302
03:02:29,440 --> 03:02:32,720
way i know it's something different so it looks like it's gonna be pretty neat

2303
03:02:32,720 --> 03:02:35,180
product some of the songs are hit and miss but you know every dance game has

2304
03:02:35,180 --> 03:02:42,060
that. So it's meant for a variety of people. Alright, cool. We're at the end of the show,

2305
03:02:42,060 --> 03:02:47,820
boys and girls. It's final thought time. Islander, thanks for being here tonight. Appreciate

2306
03:02:47,820 --> 03:02:56,060
it. Final thought? Um, final thought. Um, why am I blanking out? I don't know. Final

2307
03:02:56,060 --> 03:03:03,460
thought? Um, drink more orange juice. Loki, your final thought for tonight? No, I had

2308
03:03:03,460 --> 03:03:04,700
something

2309
03:03:04,700 --> 03:03:06,300
and I can't remember what it was

2310
03:03:06,300 --> 03:03:09,300
but uh... all I'm going to say is two things

2311
03:03:09,300 --> 03:03:13,700
one, go vote for our podcast on podcast alley go do it now

2312
03:03:13,700 --> 03:03:15,260

low key fusion and that's where you're going to find the you know when I unveil brand new

like a couple songs, including the Ecstasy remix and the

2322
03:03:41,740 --> 03:03:44,600
Radical Faith remix, which you might not have heard.

2323
03:03:44,600 --> 03:03:45,260
It's on there.

2324
03:03:45,260 --> 03:03:47,860
And also, there's a cool little banner that I made.

2325
03:03:47,860 --> 03:03:49,820

2326
03:03:49,820 --> 03:03:51,140
So anyways, check it out.

2327
03:03:51,140 --> 03:03:53,500
It's MySpace.com slash Loki Fusion.

2328

Loki Fusion, all one word.

2329
03:03:54,740 --> 03:03:57,060
All right, I'll put that in the chat room as well.

2330
03:03:57,060 --> 03:04:00,000
My final thought is, because I promised somebody I would say

2331
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:06,000
again. Hyperion, 7. Murdock is password god, right?

2332
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:11,000
Yes, that's where I play. DarkSakura, your final thought.

2333
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:18,360
Reject false ferrets. Alright, and final word of the show. You know

2334
03:04:18,360 --> 03:04:21,880
I gotta give it to the guest when we have one. Islander, one word that sums it all up.

2335
03:04:21,880 --> 03:04:24,400
See you guys next week. We appreciate you tuning in tonight.

2336
03:04:24,400 --> 03:04:26,980
You know, one word isn't going to do it.

2337
03:04:26,980 --> 03:04:28,980
It has to be two.

2338
03:04:28,980 --> 03:04:30,660
Go Spuds.

2339
03:04:30,660 --> 03:04:36,220
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

2340
03:04:36,220 --> 03:04:40,420

2342
03:04:49,220 --> 03:05:02,900
And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

2343
03:05:02,900 --> 03:05:09,200
Approach students, close the circle at the feet of the master.

2344
03:05:09,200 --> 03:05:16,660
You have come to me asking that I be your guide along the path of Taekwon leap, but

2345
03:05:16,660 --> 03:05:22,760
Be warned! To learn its ways, you must learn the ways of your own soul.

2346
03:05:22,760 --> 03:05:27,760
Let us meditate upon this wisdom now. So...

2347
03:05:27,760 --> 03:05:31,760
Ohhhhhh...

2348
03:05:31,760 --> 03:05:37,560
Ah! Sir! Sir! Ooh! Ooh! Sir!

2349
03:05:37,560 --> 03:05:42,760
Who disturbs our meditation as a pebble disturbs the stillness of the pond?

2350
03:05:42,760 --> 03:05:45,560
Me!

2351
03:05:45,560 --> 03:05:47,060
Ed Gruberman?

2352
03:05:51,060 --> 03:05:52,560
Ed Gruberman.

2353
03:05:52,560 --> 03:05:57,560
Yeah, uh, no disrespect or nothing, but like, how long is this gonna take?

2354
03:05:58,560 --> 03:06:05,060
Taekwon Leap is not a path to a door, but a road leading forever towards the horizon.

2355
03:06:05,560 --> 03:06:08,060
So like, what, an hour or so?

2356
03:06:10,560 --> 03:06:14,060
No, no, we have not even begun upon the path.

2357
03:06:14,060 --> 03:06:18,760
Ed Grubermann you must learn patience. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah patience. How long will that take?

2358
03:06:21,200 --> 03:06:28,700
Time has no meaning to a true student a year is as a day here. I want to beat people up right now

2359
03:06:29,500 --> 03:06:31,500
I've got the pajamas

2360
03:06:31,500 --> 03:06:33,500
oooh, yeah, hmm!

2361
03:06:39,280 --> 03:06:40,660
Beat people up.

2362
03:06:40,660 --> 03:06:44,660
Yeah, just show me all those nifty moves so I can start trashing bozos.

2363
03:06:44,800 --> 03:06:46,800
That's all I came here for.

2364
03:06:46,800 --> 03:06:48,800
Yaaaaaaa, pretty good idea!

2365
03:06:48,800 --> 03:06:52,740
The only use of Taiwan Leap is self-defense.

2366
03:06:52,740 --> 03:06:54,340
Do you know who said that?

2367
03:06:54,340 --> 03:06:57,040
Ki Lo Ni, the Great Teacher.

2368
03:06:57,040 --> 03:07:03,440
Yeah? Well, the best defense is a good offense. You know who said that? Mel, the cook on Alice.

2369
03:07:08,000 --> 03:07:14,960
Well, um, Tae Kwon Lip is the wine of purity, not the vinegar of hostility.

2370
03:07:15,600 --> 03:07:17,520
Meditate upon this truth with us.

2371
03:07:20,320 --> 03:07:23,440
Listen, shrimp! Now are you going to show me some fancy moves,

2372
03:07:23,440 --> 03:07:26,000
or am I going to start wiping the walls with you?

2373
03:07:26,000 --> 03:07:29,000
Ed Grubermann, you failed to grasp Taekwon Leap.

2374
03:07:29,000 --> 03:07:31,000
Approach me that you might see.

2375
03:07:31,000 --> 03:07:33,000
Alright, finally some action.

2376
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:35,000
Observe closely, class.

2377
03:07:36,000 --> 03:07:37,000
Boot to the head.

2378
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:42,000
Ow, you pulling me in the head!

2379
03:07:43,000 --> 03:07:45,000
You are lucky, Ed Grubermann.

2380
03:07:45,000 --> 03:07:49,000
Few novices experience so much of Taekwon Leap so soon.

2381
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:52,000
Now we continue.

2382
03:07:52,000 --> 03:07:54,000
Ahhhhhhhhh....

2383
03:07:54,000 --> 03:07:56,000
Hey! Hey, I wasn't ready!

2384
03:07:56,000 --> 03:07:58,000
Come and get me now, shorty, huh?

2385
03:07:58,000 --> 03:08:00,000
Come on, are you chicken?

2386
03:08:00,000 --> 03:08:02,000
Boot to the head.

2387
03:08:02,000 --> 03:08:04,000
Ow! Okay, now I'm ready, okay?

2388
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:06,000
Now, come on, try it now!

2389
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:08,000
Boot to the head.

2390
03:08:08,000 --> 03:08:12,000
Mind if I just lie down here for a minute?

2391
03:08:12,000 --> 03:08:16,000
Now, class, we shall return to our-

2392
03:08:16,000 --> 03:08:17,000
Master?

2393
03:08:17,000 --> 03:08:19,000
It is wrong to tip the vessel of knowledge, student.

2394
03:08:19,000 --> 03:08:24,680
many apologies master but I feel Ed Gruberman is not wholly wrong what do you

2395
03:08:24,680 --> 03:08:30,000
mean I want to boot some head to have you learned nothing from the lesson of

2396
03:08:30,000 --> 03:08:35,820
Ed Gruberman yes master I have learned two things first that anger is a weapon

2397
03:08:35,820 --> 03:08:40,960
only to one's opponent very good and secondly get in the first shot boot to

2398
03:08:40,960 --> 03:08:47,680
the head you missed oh yeah well you two shall be honored you don't have to you

2399
03:08:47,680 --> 03:08:49,680
I know. I got a big arm.

2400
03:08:49,680 --> 03:08:51,680
Boot to the head.

2401
03:08:51,680 --> 03:08:55,680
Can anyone tell us what lesson has been learned here?

2402
03:08:55,680 --> 03:08:58,680
Yes, Master. Not a single one of us could defeat you.

2403
03:08:58,680 --> 03:09:00,680
You gain wisdom, child.

2404
03:09:00,680 --> 03:09:02,680
So I'll have to gang up on you. Get him, go!

2405
03:09:02,680 --> 03:09:04,680
Boot to the head. Booty.

2406
03:09:10,680 --> 03:09:14,680
And now, class, let us rejoin the mind to the body

2407
03:09:14,680 --> 03:09:17,920
and gaze into the heart of the candle in meditation.

2408
03:09:23,920 --> 03:09:25,920
Very good class.

2409
03:09:41,520 --> 03:09:43,520
People talking in movies shows

2410
03:09:43,520 --> 03:09:50,520
People smoking in bed. People voting Republican. Give them a boot to the head.

2411
03:09:50,520 --> 03:09:58,520
Boot to the head! Boot to the head! Boot to the head! Boot to the head!

2412
03:09:58,520 --> 03:10:14,040
Botanics who can't fix a car, Politicians who can't think,

2413
03:10:14,040 --> 03:10:17,920
The salesman who won't leave me alone, The waiter who forgot my drink.

2414
03:10:47,920 --> 03:11:04,320
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2415
03:11:17,920 --> 03:11:28,640
I thought I was just putting the song up, but I forgot that I had that as the whole

2416
03:11:28,640 --> 03:11:29,640
thing.

2417
03:11:29,640 --> 03:11:33,480
My chat room got a kick out of that, so we appreciate anything that can get the chat

2418
03:11:33,480 --> 03:11:36,840
room all happy and stuff, because the chat room is really what keeps us going with the

2419
03:11:36,840 --> 03:11:37,840
show.

2420
03:11:37,840 --> 03:11:38,840
The chat room needs happy pants.

2421
03:11:38,840 --> 03:11:39,840
Kisses!

2422
03:11:39,840 --> 03:11:42,600
All right, thanks you guys so much for tuning in and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

2423
03:11:42,600 --> 03:11:43,600
We really appreciate it.

2424
03:11:43,600 --> 03:11:45,040
I just broke my damn headphones.

2425
03:11:45,040 --> 03:11:46,040
That's really great.

2426
03:11:46,040 --> 03:11:51,860
Alright, thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening tonight to Orange Lounge

2427
03:11:51,860 --> 03:11:52,860
Radio.

2428
03:11:52,860 --> 03:11:55,100
We hope to see you again next week, and the week after, and the week after that.

2429
03:11:55,100 --> 03:11:58,880
You're now going to get dumped from our stream, but please, re-tune back into the station

2430
03:11:58,880 --> 03:12:01,160
in about 15 seconds to resume...

2431
03:12:01,160 --> 03:12:02,160

2434
03:12:04,160 --> 03:12:05,160
What?

2435
03:12:05,160 --> 03:12:06,160
What?

2436
03:12:06,160 --> 03:12:07,160
What?

2437
03:12:07,160 --> 03:12:08,160
What?

2438
03:12:08,160 --> 03:12:09,160
What?

2439
03:12:09,160 --> 03:12:10,160
What?

2440
03:12:10,160 --> 03:12:11,160
What?

2441
03:12:11,160 --> 03:12:12,160
What?

2442
03:12:12,160 --> 03:12:13,160
What?

2443
03:12:13,160 --> 03:12:14,160
What?

2444
03:12:14,160 --> 03:12:15,160
What?

2445
03:12:15,160 --> 03:12:17,160
Thank you very much.
