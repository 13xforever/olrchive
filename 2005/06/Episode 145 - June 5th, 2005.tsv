347541	348381	Who's got a razor?
348461	352363	I'm so emo, watch me slit my wrists and bleed my angst all over the world.
352563	355345	Does anyone actually self-declare themselves as emo?
356621	358622	Like, I hear a lot of... No, because that's not cool.
358782	362504	I don't... I thought emo was, like, the hip thing to do right now, you know?
362805	365146	But I don't get it, because everybody makes fun of emo people.
365246	367587	I don't know anybody that's standing up for emo rights.
368068	370529	You know, I don't know anyone that's, like, saying, you know, I'm emo!
371069	374812	Yeah, but see, the things that you make fun of now are hip, like, next year.
374912	378334	So are you saying that, like, VH1 will do the I Love the Emo next year?
380075	380415	Yeah.
382376	385898	Remember, kids, down the block, not across the street.
389224	390905	Wow, think about that one for a minute.
391326	394288	Alright, also joining us, TechMath's Loki.
395268	396369	I love Pizza Hut.
399111	402474	It's becoming a tradition for you to come over and bring Pizza Hut every Sunday.
402514	402874	Twice.
404515	405556	Well, twice is enough.
408340	411745	I can swear, like, every week you've been in this new studio, you've brought over Pizza Hut.
411805	412906	I've only done twice!
413247	418954	The new studio, by the way, is right across the freeway from Pizza Slut slash Taco Bell.
419555	420136	Toxic Hell!
420236	422860	It's more like Taco Bell with some pizza.
424284	425465	Yeah, it really is what it is.
425865	428888	Anyway, also joining us tonight, we have a very special guest.
428928	436214	We haven't had many guests in the new studio, so we're very pleased to welcome a staff member of DDRFreak.com.
436254	437395	Say hello to Islander.
437655	437956	Hello.
439213	443134	One of the original ddrfreak.com members Yeah, can you believe that?
443234	468263	I'm over five years Shit, that's a long time I know, it's a very long time Oh, you know, before I forget I need to give a shout out to OhMyGodIt'sDubes because when I first saw that name I thought it was OhMyGodIt'sBoobs I want to know if that person stole the name from my live journal And so I was just like, wow And then I think somebody else changed their name to OhMyGodIt'sNoobs Which I thought was kind of funny too
471641	474122	Oh my God, it's something that rhymes with oobs tonight.
474202	476003	I have to say one more thing tonight, though.
476123	476623	Okay, what's that?
476863	478143	Happy birthday to Murdoch.
478984	481065	Because he's 39 and ancient.
481725	483005	But that's, in U.S.
483045	484886	time, that's actually tomorrow, right?
484906	485606	6-6 of 66?
486066	489808	It's June 6th in the U.K., so happy birthday.
489908	490848	Isn't he a fictional character?
492009	493429	I can still say happy birthday.
494389	494950	Okie doke.
497291	500292	If Mickey Mouse could have a birthday, okay?
500632	500992	Alright.
503809	507191	Alright, we'll be back after this with more happy Skippy Orange Lingerie.
507491	520499	If you want to join our chat room and, you know, hang out with OMG, it's Doobs and Boobs and Noobs and Scoobs and whatever else they come up with, head on over to our website, www.orangelingerie.com and click on chat.
521553	531082	In this break, we're going to hear some music from Poppin' Music Iroha, also known as Poppin' Music 12, because somebody wanted me to play this song last week and I never got to it.
531102	532143	I think it was Siggy or something.
532163	535746	I don't even know if he's listening right now, but can't say I didn't honor that request.
536807	538349	So, what are you giggling at over there?
538669	540050	You're giggling like a little girl.
542513	544555	You actually found an animated graphic.
545839	547500	Oh, somebody posted in the chatroom.
547540	548921	Somebody posted that in the chatroom.
548941	549561	That's brilliant.
550342	552963	Somebody posted a picture, for those of you that aren't in the chatroom.
553244	556666	Somebody actually posted a picture of a hand showing the razor.
557046	559647	And it says, remember kids, what is that?
560128	560868	Down the street.
561508	562569	Down the road, make it count.
562829	564350	Down the road, not across the street.
564690	566632	I'm going to have to find Sherlock's icon.
566772	567412	That's beautiful.
568713	569814	Alright, we'll be back after this.
569974	570674	Poppin' music.
571535	572135	Orange Launch Radio.

943784	945666	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
974022	975725	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
992990	993971	Thank you for watching!
1022484	1024146	Thanks for watching!
1050345	1054209	Orange Lounge Radio, Bomani Music, and more.
1054329	1055550	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
1055570	1057713	We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
1058553	1060075	In that break, Shizuku, the new StartMine remix.
1071120	1078103	The new Akira Yamaoka song, Usoki Hyper Rock, and Virokana, all from Papa Music Iroha.
1078543	1082565	Or if you're lazy like me, you can just say Papa Music 12, but technically it's Papa Music Iroha.
1083351	1084012	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1111755	1113696	and all the, and Goonies.
1114616	1115196	Yeah, that's cool.
1115216	1116397	Well, the Goonies was in Pop Music 10.
1116437	1117217	Oh, and I played Star Mine.
1117977	1118257	Did you?
1118377	1119498	I thought you hated that remix.
1120018	1121138	I do hate it, but I had to play it.
1121258	1121659	Oh, okay.
1124119	1125260	It was actually pretty fun and easy.
1126808	1128629	I like poppin' music an awful lot.
1128689	1138454	I sometimes resent it because it seems like there's all these new poppin' music games coming out and then, you know, whereas Guitar Freaks, well, I guess we do have... I keep thinking PS2.
1139995	1141516	But, like, no new DDR lately.
1142517	1144978	So I guess I gotta resent poppin' music for being so damn successful.
1145258	1146419	But it really is a cute game.
1146779	1149421	And it's really weird that not a lot of arcades here have it.
1149461	1150621	Well, I mean, it is and it isn't.
1150662	1152443	I mean, let's face it, the music in poppin' music...
1153473	1156255	is a little scary to, I think, a lot of people.
1157717	1159498	But, I don't know, to me, it's cute.
1159598	1160119	I like it.
1160799	1162020	I think more people should be into it.
1163542	1166825	Hi, we're here on Orange Laundry Radio, episode number 145.
1167565	1170067	Somebody in chat told me I said 140 in the opening.
1170147	1170828	Oops, my bad.
1170888	1172129	It's actually 145 tonight.
1172750	1174791	I thought I said 145, but somebody said I said 140.
1174872	1177734	I don't know.
1177974	1179556	145 tonight, that means we're very close to 150.
1179596	1179936	Isn't that scary?
1182256	1183376	You know what else is this month?
1184797	1187178	The three-year anniversary of this show.
1187718	1188898	Three years!
1189698	1191519	Come along with us on that BART ride, huh?
1191879	1192499	Seriously.
1192679	1194940	And this show is now old enough to attend preschool.
1195820	1196140	Yes.
1197641	1200782	You know, when I was three, I had a good vocabulary.
1201102	1205243	And I think that our vocabulary has grown quite a bit from shit, fuck, damn, you know.
1207404	1209584	Oh, but I still like my dick and fart jokes.
1210985	1211065	Pfft.
1212648	1214149	I still like burping on the microphone.
1215250	1217332	It guarantees that the microphone stays in my possession.
1217612	1218413	Listen to the opening.
1218473	1219594	It still has the fart noise in it.
1220434	1225238	And I don't think anybody that was listening to us episode one still listens, which is kind of sad.
1226499	1228080	Wasn't Dark Tetsuya there for episode one?
1228281	1228621	Yeah.
1228641	1229582	I think that's about it.
1230903	1232764	Wasn't he in the room for episode one?
1232804	1234486	Puppy listens still occasionally.
1234786	1235206	Yeah.
1235627	1238449	Puppy needs to actually do his correspondent job.
1238469	1240510	Bradley, Arcadian42, he was there episode one.
1240530	1241111	Yeah, he was.
1241231	1242332	So we do have a few people.
1242588	1246329	We have some of our old schoolers.
1246949	1251570	Anyway, so we'll be having our three year anniversary special thingy sometime this month.
1251910	1255831	Don't know when yet, because I could be out of town one of the weeks this month, so we'll see.
1256071	1256831	Well that's poopy.
1257011	1262793	Yeah, I'm going to be going to LA this month, and then actually in August I'm going to be going to the East Coast.
1263553	1266074	I actually have two trips to the East Coast planned right now, which is really weird.
1266194	1267554	One for work and one for leisure.
1269018	1276984	I was going to go to the New York area around Labor Day, and now I'm going to be going to Pennsylvania in August.
1277705	1278606	So that's kind of interesting.
1278646	1279046	I'm sorry?
1279246	1285852	Well, I heard about, you know, it's kind of empty, there's not a whole lot there, but I heard about some classic gaming store out there.
1286212	1289094	Somebody had sent me a tip over email, so I'm really curious to check that out.
1289675	1294519	I just hope it doesn't suck like a certain classic video game store we have here in town.
1296533	1297053	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1314153	1317637	No, I will give a short history on that one.
1318478	1324844	Leah, who was the ex-wife partner, went into business with Dan to keep the store alive, and so it became Game On.
1326486	1330210	And then she kind of screwed him up, because she wanted pocket money, because she was dating a rich guy.
1330750	1331091	Uh-huh.
1331707	1332107	DarkSakura
1361997	1367580	My week was work, and of course having Monday off, like all of us who work for a bank did.
1370461	1373183	And I really didn't do a whole bunch of anything.
1373323	1375744	Played some PSO, of course.
1376584	1380927	Played some Silent Hill, didn't get too far, so I'm actually at the same save point I was at before.
1382187	1385189	Played a lot of Puyo Puyo, watched Dan beat Fire Emblem.
1387537	1389640	How was your week?
1389680	1390421	How was your day?
1407927	1409729	The weekend was okay.
1410069	1412432	I played a little Final Fantasy yesterday.
1414154	1418961	And then pretty much I had to do stuff for Nelly's birthday.
1419041	1420442	So we went to Red Lobster.
1420483	1421524	I hate seafood.
1422182	1422922	But I got steak.
1422982	1423643	Steak's good.
1423903	1426284	And then, um... What else?
1426664	1427965	Uh... Not too much.
1428045	1430586	I think during the week was just kind of... Eh.
1430606	1431826	It was kind of slow.
1432447	1433707	It was nice having a short week, though.
1433847	1441771	You know, I've got to go back to Red Lobster at some point, because there's a waiter there, and I think he's gay, because he was giving us all this free food.
1441811	1443932	It was me and two of my gay friends went over to Red Lobster.
1443972	1446773	He started giving us, like, all this free food and didn't charge us for it.
1446793	1448074	We didn't get charged for drinks.
1448534	1450295	He brought us, like, double sides and stuff.
1451545	1455529	I'll just... Highlander's getting all kind of gay as he says, I want to go with you.
1457190	1460413	No, I swear, there's like this pink mafia out there.
1460733	1463856	And, you know, I'm going to expose the secret here.
1465017	1474325	If you get the slightest inclination that somebody at a particular service industry, like, you know, at a store, at a restaurant, might be, you know, gay...
1475885	1478747	Flirt with them because you'll get a discount or something.
1478867	1485711	Or if they suspect that you're at least like a gay rights supporter, you can get like breaks and stuff.
1485751	1486231	It's really weird.
1486251	1489594	Does that mean we need to go into Red Lobster wearing a shirt that says hag on it?
1489854	1491034	Yeah.
1491815	1493376	I'll tell you which waiter it is too.
1493396	1493916	Okay.
1496618	1498179	I swear there's like a pink mafia out there.
1500954	1501655	I don't know about that.
1502375	1506476	But anyways, other than that, really, nothing has been going on.
1506496	1508416	It's pretty much just been work stuff.
1508796	1514758	I know we've got our Dallas people coming out in the week of the 20th, which I think is a couple weeks away now.
1515498	1520559	So they're gonna come out to which I guess I have to play them at some games or something, kick their ass, just because that's
1521161	1524622	You know, standard company procedure.
1525222	1533025	And then today I went to Pizza Hut and I got two things of breadsticks and the pepperoni pizza.
1534126	1535866	I've eaten half of that.
1536106	1540308	I still have one thing of breadsticks left, which I'm debating about keeping for later on.
1541128	1542529	Because they're damn good.
1542729	1543669	Fascinating, really.
1544449	1545430	It is fascinating.
1545990	1548311	Then today I had to build a computer for my sister and
1550170	1559061	I don't know where half of my motherboards went, but I have a lot of crappy computer parts, so she's going to get a computer that's about comparable with what we used to run the show on.
1560923	1563586	The reason I say it's comparable is because it's almost out of the same parts.
1564347	1564928	And, um...
1566223	1567304	I have a complaint about that movie.
1567324	1567684	What's that?
1594156	1595617	I haven't seen it yet, so no spoilers.
1595677	1596377	General Grievous.
1597658	1600900	I heard how just kick-ass he was in the Clone Wars cartoon.
1602701	1609025	Yeah, he... Damn it, it's hard for me to make my major complaint or else I'll spill it for Rob.
1609745	1610165	That's okay.
1610445	1613207	But it's just something about Obi-Wan riding a giant iguana.
1615427	1617348	Yeah, there was some iguana writing.
1618049	1618409	I don't know.
1618469	1618869	It's weird.
1619570	1620030	Yeah, it's weird.
1620070	1620611	Interesting.
1621031	1622572	I'm supposed to see it Tuesday.
1622972	1623153	Okay.
1623313	1626055	Me and some of the Pink Mafia are going to check it out.
1627576	1629917	Why aren't you listening to Pump Up the Volume?
1629957	1631118	Maybe we'll get in free.
1631198	1631559	I don't know.
1632920	1636662	Because I'm trying to revive my own show at some point.
1636822	1639204	So between that and karaoke, I don't have a lot of free weeknights.
1641701	1643623	Don't make me, like, haunt you or something.
1644243	1644904	I'll TiVo it.
1645224	1655534	Speaking of haunting, we're supposed to be scheduling another trip out to some remote cemetery that's down by Dry Town in Sutter Creek.
1656275	1659278	And apparently it's on some guy's land and we won't get bothered out there.
1659618	1661000	Yeah, whatever happened to the ghost hunting?
1661720	1682928	It's been on a hiatus for a while, just because A, I'm moving and everything, and B, we've been trying to get in contact with local members of, I forget, there's an actual organization that people sign up for, which I really don't think there's a big deal behind it, but it's just like, they have standard protocol to take or something like that.
1683129	1685509	So when you go ghost hunting, is it like Luigi's Mansion?
1686230	1687390	No, it's not like Luigi's Mansion.
1687430	1688531	Did you take a vacuum cleaner?
1688551	1689331	I know!
1689938	1693140	No, it's not like that at all.
1693200	1700664	It's mainly, it's just kind of like surveying, basically just take readings of areas and whatnot.
1701044	1717973	The thing that I would probably be doing, though, that most normal people would be doing is they usually don't try to disturb the area, whereas I believe it's like if you want the rat to come out of the woodpile, you've got to start shaking the woodpile for that to happen.
1718773	1722054	So, same sense in this.
1722454	1725015	If you want something to happen, you gotta piss it off.
1727957	1728697	Mario!
1729777	1734859	Anyways, but no, supposedly we're just gonna go chill down there.
1734879	1738380	We were gonna do an all nighter thing, but my fiance didn't like that idea.
1738781	1743422	So, instead we're gonna go down there at dusk and hang out during the night for a little bit.
1743983	1745423	Should we go ghost hunting in Alabama?
1746123	1747804	Because we actually have old cemeteries.
1748342	1749762	Well, this is an old cemetery, too.
1750422	1753843	These are from, like, the 1700s and 1600s.
1753903	1755763	I don't want to talk to old people.
1755783	1758004	It's all fun.
1758064	1759064	No, anyways, I don't know.
1759084	1760004	I have a picture of a ghost.
1762805	1765725	Yeah, but you know everyone has a picture of Michael Jackson, so it's okay.
1766465	1768866	Anyways, that's all.
1769806	1770086	I'm done.
1771906	1773866	Islander, how was your week and how was your day?
1775267	1777067	My week started off at Fanime, actually.
1778067	1781568	A big anime convention down in the Bay Area.
1782368	1786709	And woke up, unfortunately, with a hangover.
1788790	1790270	Too many tequila shots, not a good thing.
1791330	1795372	And either my roommate or someone down there got me sick.
1795792	1797532	So the entire week I've been fighting a cold.
1797732	1800193	I'm pretty much getting over it at this point.
1801853	1804914	Today, I was in the mood for Pump It Up.
1806112	1807293	Another dance simulation game.
1808373	1809134	Pump It Up, really?
1809154	1809734	I've never heard of it.
1810154	1811015	I'm kidding.
1811655	1812295	For those of you who don't know.
1812335	1814016	I think most of our listeners know Pump It Up.
1814036	1814556	I'm pretty sure they do.
1814576	1814957	I hope you do.
1815197	1815757	I'm pretty sure they do.
1815777	1817558	If you don't, Korean five panels.
1818579	1819279	Yeah, that's it.
1819379	1819899	That's all I need to know.
1819919	1821500	So I had to drive all the way down to Florin Mall.
1822240	1823701	They still have Pump It Up there?
1823981	1826263	They still have Pump It Up there, and they have a Dance Freaks.
1827083	1827783	OMG!
1828424	1830445	Yes, the Korean version of Dance Mania X.
1831295	1832636	OMG, I have to go play this.
1832876	1834097	Do they have different songs in it?
1834498	1837720	Um, it's basically DMX1 with a few K-pop songs thrown in.
1838281	1839422	Are any decent K-pop songs?
1840022	1842764	Um... There's a few good ones.
1843605	1844806	No, unfortunately, Caution is not in it.
1844826	1845586	How about Starion?
1845626	1846767	It's in every other K-pop song.
1847268	1848068	Is Starion in it, really?
1848108	1851711	No, Starion's not in it, but there is a Baek Ji Young song called Dash.
1851851	1857696	There is a few songs... I know it was in another game.
1857716	1857756	Um...
1860816	1867558	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1883103	1884844	I was watching it going, what the hell?
1884864	1886365	I was expecting it, because...
1907625	1911628	Bakwa is such a kind of like, I don't know, it strikes me as a very angsty kind of song.
1912468	1917512	And I was expecting her to be kicking some ass or something, not freaking sitting on the rock being the Little Mermaid.
1919073	1919513	Exactly.
1920754	1925818	I was expecting her little crab friend and fish flounder to pop up and start singing along, you know?
1926638	1931962	But yeah, that's pretty much it, and now I'm here.
1933171	1934371	Well, I'm glad you could make time for us.
1934391	1935492	That's very nice.
1936012	1939793	I'm actually trying to read up on what's going on with that Pump It Up tourney.
1941033	1943793	I know there was one a couple weeks ago in Dallas, Texas.
1943953	1944694	It was going on.
1945014	1948454	It was one of those qualifiers for the big Pump It Up tournament in Korea.
1948795	1952215	But I haven't heard anything else about future qualifiers since then.
1953856	1956976	I'd be really mad if that's the only qualifying tourney in the United States.
1956996	1957437	That would suck.
1957477	1959337	But there's got to be one that happens in the...
1960925	1962286	in the bay at some point.
1963047	1967710	Dallas is right in the middle for this big country for everyone to go to.
1968590	1976616	I was looking over on Mastiff's site to see if they have anything on it, and they are still plugging a smidget being at the Metreon on February 11th.
1978057	1980859	Which, by the way, I didn't even know the Metreon had Pump It Up.
1980919	1981600	I don't think they do.
1982340	1983981	So they must have wheeled in a machine for that.
1985182	1986783	Unless they replaced one of their other machines.
1987464	1987824	Not sure.
1987904	1990526	Now I'm trying to check out Amaro's site and see if they have anything going on.
1991297	1993358	And I don't see anything.
1996919	1997759	But I'll keep looking.
1997799	1999199	Maybe somebody in our chat room knows.
1999259	2001020	If anybody in our chat room knows, feel free to share.
2001060	2004080	We'll read it on air and try to get what's going on with that tournament.
2004460	2008241	Because I'm sure a lot of people that aren't just in Texas want to qualify what's going on there.
2011229	2012951	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2026769	2027510	That's the spirit.
2028991	2031612	The goth club was actually quite a bit of fun.
2031872	2033673	I was wearing one of the brightest shirts there.
2033994	2036355	I was wearing my shirt... You could see you from across the room.
2036435	2044980	I was wearing... See, because most people at the goth club wear all black, or sometimes, like, the gothy goths wear white, because, you know, they're going to be different.
2045340	2053125	I wore a bright-ass red shirt, because it was my English.com shirt, and it said, I hate myself and I want to die, because I thought that would be appropriate for the goth club.
2054048	2054889	Team America World Police
2073324	2074364	I'm so ornery.
2074524	2076785	And you were watching South Park.
2076805	2077925	South Park, the movie, yeah.
2078565	2079906	No, I went and saw Crash.
2079946	2082566	I think that was on Monday, which was good.
2082747	2090268	It's just very unapologetic and in-your-face type thing where some of the language is very raw.
2091049	2099951	It's a movie that deals with racism, so if the N-word makes you uncomfortable or any of the other various racial slurs, Loki, you'd have no problem with this movie.
2101011	2103432	If any of those various racial slurs make you uncomfortable.
2104612	2106113	But actually, it was a really good movie.
2106193	2106753	It was really good.
2106793	2107293	Really well done.
2107773	2108333	So I recommend it.
2109573	2111794	Otherwise, not a whole lot going on.
2113014	2116355	I went out to play In the Groove, actually, twice this week.
2116655	2117696	Yes!
2118436	2119556	I just... Well, you know what?
2119696	2122337	I'm loving the USB support thing because...
2123417	2131881	One reason I like the way In The Groove has its workout mode set up is that you don't have to do a special mode to have it count your calories.
2132341	2134502	It actually counts your calories while you're playing a normal game.
2134782	2136443	This kind of bugs me about DDR.
2136463	2137003	I don't know why.
2137043	2138444	It's such a little-ass problem.
2138764	2143366	But I wish that, and I think the only game that ever did this was Disney's Rave.
2143867	2147768	Funny enough, Disney's Rave is the only DDR game that did a lot of things correctly.
2147848	2149149	Let's say Dance Magic...
2149669	2153190	and then it counts your calories no matter what mode you're playing in.
2153511	2170757	The reason why I don't like workout mode in like PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions is that if you play in workout mode, you don't unlock new songs, you don't technically save your grades or your scores or anything, so there's no point in playing in workout mode unless you are strictly there to burn calories.
2171077	2173258	But I like to unlock songs as I play DDR.
2173278	2175299	I don't know about the rest of you, but that's part of the fun of it, so...
2176167	2179549	Anyway, so In The Groove has the fantastic USB support.
2179909	2182691	Say what you will about the game, but the USB support is fantastic.
2183531	2185572	So, I've been having fun with that.
2186193	2186953	The game itself, eh.
2188034	2195057	It's just kind of holding me over until there's a new DDR, which, I don't know, I'm not going to hold my breath at this point, but maybe some home versions this fall.
2195538	2195878	We'll see.
2196118	2197439	Well, we know there's home versions, but you know.
2197699	2199520	I want new arcade stuff really bad.
2201061	2203202	Okay.
2204863	2205383	Moving on.
2207048	2209449	Let's see what's going on in the Bomani world news-wise.
2210410	2213031	I thought we had a... I know two things.
2213191	2213591	What's that?
2213731	2215512	Jack and... No, I'm kidding.
2215912	2220174	It's really a slow... Video gaming altogether is kind of a slow news period right now.
2220214	2220895	It's kind of sad.
2220955	2222195	It's on vacation after E3.
2222235	2223776	Yeah, it really is.
2224536	2229879	Checking some of the headlines recently over on TED-DDR Freak, which, by the way, replays our show on Friday nights.
2230679	2231940	Those lovely folks over there.
2232120	2232340	Yes.
2233241	2233341	Um...
2234341	2240104	They actually had like a legal perspective, explain the Konami vs. Rockstar thing.
2240924	2249388	Which, if you were totally confused by the lawsuit, I would hope that if you listened to our program a couple weeks ago when that subject first came up, that we helped explain things for you.
2249428	2258452	But if you're still lost, they kind of had somebody that is in law school or recently finished with law school try to kind of explain it a little more.
2258933	2261254	So it's a fun read, so check that out.
2261994	2269580	Also very interesting that's brought up in there is that Roxor is supposed to have like 20 days to do a response to the lawsuit.
2269760	2274804	So it'll be interesting because sometime this week, even though it's been over 20 days, it might be 20 business days.
2274844	2275464	I don't know how it works.
2275844	2284351	But somebody, we're thinking this week we might get some more information on exactly what Roxor's comment's going to be to that.
2284951	2288293	Or as I predict, the out-of-court settlement will happen very soon.
2289594	2289995	But we'll see.
2291394	2301515	And then of course there were some new trailers posted over on IGN.com for DDR Extreme 2 and Ultramix 3, which really don't show anything new as far as I remember from looking at the trailers.
2301535	2302758	There's really nothing new in it.
2303457	2309698	and then a Beatmania trailer is available over on Games Are Fun but it's the same damn thing they showed at E3.
2309938	2310759	Exactly the same thing.
2310859	2311919	Really not a lot new.
2312899	2318240	New news possibly on Xtreme 2 at Comic Con if it's going to be anything like last year.
2318260	2323821	You remember last year at Comic Con in July in San Diego they actually brought a build of Xtreme.
2324621	2327742	Last year it was Xtreme and we found out some new songs that way.
2327822	2332163	So we're hoping that this year they'll do the same thing and we'll find out some new stuff for Xtreme 2.
2333482	2333983	We shall see.
2335144	2336045	It will be very interesting.
2349590	2375125	and then we'll also get into tonight's cage match very soon as well as your calls via the skype line www.orangeloungeradio.com by the way we're looking into this new thing we might do I actually this is the first time I have even said this to the others because Jason brought this to my attention just like two days ago but there's actually this new thing called skype in where we could get a phone number and then if somebody calls the phone number it'll come in on skype
2376396	2377977	So we'll probably be looking into that.
2378037	2385859	So possibly in the very near future, Orange Lounge Radio, for those of you that don't get the Skype thing or don't want it, we will have a phone number that you can call to be on the program.
2386859	2388360	So that will be a very cool addition.
2388440	2388780	We'll see.
2389440	2390080	Alright, anyway.
2391021	2393401	After this break, we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio.
2393422	2396202	And this break, music from 2DX Night Style.
2396683	2403345	Started off with a popular song from 2DX Night Style that we haven't played in a while, so I thought you kids would enjoy this.
2403605	2404225	Lionski.
2459922	2460724	Thank you for watching!
2678607	2679567	Thanks for watching!
2748646	2749286	Thanks for watching!
2870094	2879102	And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's favorite perverse Bomani band, Erotic.
2879523	2880443	Do it all night.
2880704	2881564	Do it with me.
2882025	2883446	No, no, that was awful.
2883526	2884407	Bloody terrible.
2884447	2885788	Do you take vocal lessons?
2885868	2886849	Kill your teacher.
2887350	2888370	In the heat of the night.
2888831	2891073	Oh, God, I think my ears are bleeding.
2892254	2892935	I liked it.
2893455	2894996	Shut the bloody hell up, Paula.
2895096	2895497	Next.
2897438	2900479	Uh, that was cool.
2901280	2903060	Do you even know why you're here?
2903140	2904841	That was just bloody pathetic.
2904901	2905381	Next!
2908322	2909802	Come on, do it with me.
2910743	2912003	Yes, yes, that's it!
2912363	2913523	We have a winner!
2914324	2918425	A Star is Born, here on Orange Lounge Radio.
2919895	2920915	God, that promo's old.
2921575	2922696	I thought with the whole American Idol.
2922716	2923416	That is really old.
2923496	2928417	I thought with all the American Idol stuff, it's not even that good compared to some of our other promos.
2928817	2936819	But I thought with the whole American Idol thing going on this past couple weeks that it was time to play that again.
2937099	2940000	So congratulations to Carrie Underwood, your erotic pop idol.
2940868	2942529	I'm sure we'll be in Playboy in a matter of years.
2943070	2944791	Because that's where most of those pop idols are at.
2944811	2946452	I haven't even followed it since Carrie.
2946472	2948074	Carrie Underwood is useless.
2948954	2951276	I can sing country music, but can you sing pop music?
2951596	2954919	I can sing country music, but can you sing pop music?
2955339	2955840	Country?
2956020	2957181	No, pop music.
2958281	2958622	Pop!
2959582	2960163	That's all she could do.
2960263	2961664	Every song she sang was a country song.
2961804	2964066	She's so going to be on The Surreal Life in two years.
2964921	2967723	I haven't followed it since I bought Clay's album.
2968343	2970605	I did buy Clay's album and I was proud of it.
2971585	2972826	Because he has a good voice.
2974507	2975508	But he has a really good voice.
2976589	2978330	What happened to Clay Aiken?
2980111	2981312	I don't know, but he's pretty.
2981792	2983133	He's invisible.
2983313	2984394	We don't know what happened to him.
2987042	2993230	You have to understand, what happened was, is there was a rival, you know, between, you know... Ruben and Clay?
2993451	2997115	Biggie, Ruben, and Clay, you see, and, you know, they gunned him down.
2998437	3000300	Oh, I figured that Ruben just ate Clay.
3001778	3013926	Actually, Ruben was having, I think, to visit a nutritionist because he was saying he was comfortable in his own body, but he was actually starting to develop heart issues and things last I checked.
3014206	3015327	We saw people going to die?
3016387	3019249	He's the people who's going to, I don't know.
3020010	3025973	But there's been a big health concern regarding the fact that he's basically put on 100 pounds since he won.
3026334	3026774	It's too bad.
3027074	3027774	Dang! 101?
3028975	3031558	He needs to start playing some DDR.
3031778	3037904	The bigger I am, the bigger I am on the charts.
3039025	3040786	I know that he's gained a lot of weight since then.
3041387	3042428	Look at the comparison pictures.
3043549	3044570	He's a big boy now.
3045951	3046331	Wow.
3046892	3051516	Who was that rap artist way back in the day that used to be like... Heavy D?
3051696	3054379	Yeah, Heavy D. Dude, Heavy D was cool.
3056124	3061771	Dude, Biz Markie was on that VH1 Get Fit show.
3061831	3062772	Celebrity Fit Club.
3063193	3064134	I love Biz Markie.
3064635	3065496	And the Snapple Lady.
3066977	3067658	She was on that too.
3067698	3068439	Yes, she was.
3068620	3069721	As well as Mia Tyler and
3070165	3070465	VH1 shows
3087164	3091826	In the same house with Omarosa from The Apprentice and Janice Dickinson for America's Next Top Model.
3092146	3097347	Which, by the way, if America's Next Top Model is not your guilty pleasure show, it should be.
3097427	3100048	Because that show, what a bunch of bitches.
3100808	3101428	Seriously.
3101508	3105770	Nelly was watching this one show yesterday on VH1.
3105790	3107230	I guess it's called Strip Search.
3107550	3109111	I'm surprised, Rob, you haven't heard of it.
3109231	3113252	Actually, my roommate watches Strip Search every week.
3114492	3116133	Okay, I was like, this is weird.
3116173	3117534	He's probably watching it right now.
3117554	3122776	I was overhearing it while I was, you know, uploading my MySpace site, which I'll have to cover later.
3123236	3130780	And, um, so, it's just like, I guess they make these guys do, like, their strip dances in, like, the middle of, like, wherever they're working or whatever.
3130840	3135962	And I guess they can go and compete to become, like, the next, um... Thunder from Down Under.
3136002	3138163	Yeah, Thunder from Down Under show.
3138964	3139324	But, um...
3140758	3143320	I've got thunder down under, it's called my fat thighs.
3143820	3144541	I don't know about you.
3144561	3146102	Oh, man.
3146122	3149083	What the hell are we talking about before?
3149103	3151725	If I clap them together, it might make a thunderous noise, I don't know.
3152205	3152486	Anyway.
3152826	3155027	What the hell are we talking about before we get on this weird tangent?
3155067	3155547	I don't know.
3156748	3157609	Oh, American Idol.
3157649	3160230	I think I made Islander just throw up in his mouth a little bit, though.
3160891	3161531	American Idol.
3161831	3167215	Well, since we were talking about American Idol, have you seen the previews for that show, You Think You Can Dance?
3167235	3167295	Yes.
3168684	3170866	No, is that the dance show on ABC?
3171046	3173368	That's the dance show that's going to be on Fox.
3173548	3175309	Fuckin' all these reality shows.
3175430	3178292	It's going to be, imagine American Idol except dancing.
3179933	3180874	I should go on that show.
3181274	3182595	Including the people that can't dance.
3182815	3184377	No, you know what show actually I should go on?
3184757	3185658	Beauty and the Geek.
3186678	3187319	I saw that show.
3187339	3192643	You would think this show is a, no seriously, from the previews, I thought this show was going to be a big pile of trash.
3193324	3194985	It actually was a really cute show.
3196548	3196948	I thought.
3197009	3197829	I don't know about you, Loki.
3197849	3199250	Which one again?
3199831	3201792	It's all these really nerdy guys.
3201812	3204594	I mean, more nerdier than Bill Gates.
3204614	3206135	Like E3 goers.
3206215	3207296	Yeah, like E3 goers.
3207376	3208357	I haven't bathed in a few days.
3208377	3211379	Yeah, but you bathed.
3212219	3214141	They put them against Playboy models.
3214801	3238048	but the thing is that then they go in competitions and they pair off and they have to do competitions so the geeks have to teach the models like how to like spell and then the models have to teach the geeks like how to dance and how to do like social things so actually in the first episode they had a dance competition for the geeks and the models were in what a fifth grade spelling bee or what were they doing?
3238669	3242510	yeah that has to be hilarious it was so great because the one girl was like
3243010	3243591	Tattoo.
3243851	3245032	T-A-T-O-O.
3246113	3247734	She got all excited because she won.
3248175	3249236	And then they're like, no.
3249316	3251498	They're like, no, it's not like that.
3252185	3259007	But it was really, like, the way they do it, they do it without it being demeaning, I think.
3259267	3262567	Like, it's poking fun without being malicious.
3262807	3267108	But a shot like that would be followed up immediately with the girl who actually wins it.
3267188	3273390	She's going, I feel so great right now because I've never won an intelligence competition in my entire life until today.
3273790	3276350	And you're kind of like, that's so cute.
3276490	3277811	That's so sad.
3279428	3280309	Congratulations!
3280349	3282791	You're at the fifth grade reading level there.
3284132	3284632	So, anyway.
3286133	3286394	Yeah.
3288575	3289856	But, yeah.
3290497	3290817	Anyways.
3291758	3292459	Sorry, yeah.
3292499	3294020	That was my reality show tangent.
3294060	3296101	No, but seriously, Beauty and the Geek, it's actually really cute.
3296162	3296602	You should watch it.
3296662	3297382	Anyway, Loki.
3297543	3299624	Loki has some actual Bomani news for you kids.
3300045	3303187	Well, it's not Bomani news because... Is it one of Bomani?
3304528	3306250	One of Bomani, I guess.
3306950	3308972	Anyways, let me see here.
3310049	3320896	Basically, I decided, you know, it's been a while since we heard something about those other games that are out there, so I figured I'd go take a peek and see what's actually being worked on.
3321056	3323898	So, Neon FM is where all the news is right now.
3324279	3336527	Apparently, they've had a kind of an invitation-only, you know, debuting of their machine and stuff, which looks pretty cool, and considering it's all being done by scratch, it's pretty awesome.
3336647	3337968	And what they've got so far...
3338732	3357099	Um, basically you've got something that looks kind of similar to DDR, not really, um, it's, uh, basically you've got five panels on each side, arranged kind of like, um, a normal Beatmania controller, you know, back in the five key days, um, and- Without the turntable.
3357359	3361101	Well, yeah, obviously without the turntable, that'd be a little weird if it had- But that would be fun!
3361441	3362441	Ice skating revolution!
3363161	3367363	Exactly, um, so basically, uh, we've got those, and, um,
3368917	3372099	It's basically, they were showing some of the screenshots and more of the gameplay.
3372139	3375801	And they, I guess, debuted this at Betson.
3377401	3380623	For those who don't know, Betson is an arcade parts supplier.
3381344	3384405	And they're the ones actually building the machines for Neon FM.
3385286	3388807	And they actually debuted it, I guess, at one of their warehouses there.
3389108	3390488	So that was kind of interesting to see.
3392245	3394026	Some more interesting stuff that's happening right now.
3394306	3400951	I guess Thomas Howard, the same Thomas Howard that may be featured in La Seniorita and all that stuff.
3401691	3403653	He's actually going to... Captain T!
3403793	3404513	Captain T, yes.
3404854	3412178	He's actually going to Japan right now to film a live performance with the other artist that sings Girls Butts.
3412859	3415561	And they're doing the live video that's going to be in the background for that song.
3416401	3417842	Oh, God.
3418042	3420204	Girls Butts is going to be the reason to play...
3421318	3423099	and honestly, what else?
3423619	3428681	Oh, they've got, there's, what else?
3428821	3430922	Damn, where did my clip of girl's butts go?
3430942	3432582	I used to have it.
3432602	3433342	Well, don't worry about it.
3433482	3435983	We'll be able to get you some clips in a little bit.
3436043	3437304	I'm going to download this other thing.
3437384	3437784	All right, fine.
3438194	3441295	It's basically 20-second samples of a bunch of different songs.
3441755	3453099	But we actually have some of the full-length songs, not obviously the same cut that's going to be in the game, but from Poppin' Co., which is one of the artists that does the music in the game.
3453579	3456980	And it's some pretty interesting generic stuff right now.
3457400	3458840	Are we going to play clips from these songs here?
3459281	3460801	I suppose we should just play clips, yeah.
3460821	3462282	Let's just play clips, because these are kind of long.
3462302	3463542	So here's a clip of...
3464182	3465765	Are all these songs in the game?
3465785	3467808	Because there's two songs here called Complete Shot.
3468409	3472716	Complete Shot, I think the Greek Fire mix is not in the game, but the other one is.
3472836	3477323	Then let's play a clip here of the Club Blend mix of Complete Shot.
3477363	3477664	Here it is.
3478024	3479066	This is going to be a Neon FM.
3496074	3498336	Is this like their version of Max 300, or what is this?
3498717	3502000	No, I think it's probably just, it's more stuff to it.
3502521	3504082	You know, it's because it's a long version of the song.
3504102	3504943	Death Metal!
3506304	3507706	Worship Satan!
3511109	3514372	No, it's just like, you know, a techno song.
3531721	3533645	Yeah, that might be a Max 300 song.
3533705	3534446	Not too shabby.
3534646	3535287	Not too shabby.
3535688	3536730	Better sound than in the groove.
3537351	3539695	Well, they're different.
3539735	3540036	I don't know.
3540096	3540597	It's hard to say.
3540717	3541919	All right, here's a clip of the other song.
3541939	3543021	This is Electro 8.
3543742	3543963	Yeah.
3544223	3544764	Enjoy this one.
3580816	3582117	Thanks for watching!
3597083	3622667	May 13th prototype party where they had it at Betzen and you can actually see pictures of the cabinet and actually if you go to NeonFM.com you can check out they have more screenshots or actual shots of the cabinet that you can see the actual buttons and stuff and it looks pretty cool actually so far and they've done a pretty good job with the game I believe I wish they'd just call it Feet Mania because that would be funny because it looks really cool from what they've got so far I mean
3623499	3625561	That just makes me think of Stepping Selection.
3626821	3632465	And I have bad, bad traumatized memories of Stepping Selection.
3632586	3633046	You know what?
3633706	3634547	Boo Jaleco.
3635628	3638370	I'm actually excited about Neon FM.
3638450	3640691	I think they're doing a lot of things right.
3641152	3646756	And sadly, I think the reason why they're doing a lot of things right is because they've been able to learn from everything in the groove did wrong.
3647076	3651319	And here's the other thing, too, which is going to be before everyone starts going, well, they're going to get sued!
3651599	3655601	Well, they're actually working with Konami of America throughout the entire process of developing this game.
3655681	3659003	That's what I think is, like, really kind of weird, in a way.
3659043	3662725	Not really, because it's not bad, it's just weird.
3662985	3677653	It makes sense, because they're getting feedback from them, what they think, and also they're making sure that all their bases are covered, like, you know, hey, is there anything we're infringing on that we need to be copyright, you know, paying you for licensing and stuff, and they're taking care of all that.
3677673	3680475	Yes, you should be giving us 50 million dollars.
3681295	3690920	But, honestly, I don't think this is going to be much of a problem compared to, like, say, you know, in the groove, which looked exactly like DDR, this is at least, doesn't resemble DDR.
3690980	3698183	New cabinet, new dance pad, they've kind of, even in the screens, it doesn't look anything like DDR because of the way they've rearranged things, so.
3698203	3699664	Yeah, it's very different.
3700202	3702483	That's why I give the game a lot of credit.
3703343	3707305	I hope it catches on enough so that we see this in a sizable number of arcades.
3707325	3712647	Honestly, I'm glad to see something that's different than, say, DDR Pump It Up.
3712687	3714467	Something that'll be a little different.
3715368	3718869	Also, good comment from our chatroom.
3719289	3723531	Ron Chan says, maybe the FM in Neon FM stands for Feet Mania.
3723551	3725311	I like that.
3725452	3726532	So Neon Feet Mania.
3727079	3727899	We have a genius.
3728139	3730720	And here's another thing also, in case you're interested.
3731220	3736862	There's a link on Neon FM's site here where you can actually download ringtones for your cell phone.
3737283	3738583	One of them being Girls Butts.
3738863	3739223	Yes!
3739663	3740064	Fun.
3741244	3744385	Dude, I'm so downloading that for my... Does it support Sprint, or do we know?
3744825	3748627	Well, they have a picture here that shows M-Mode, so... I don't know.
3748727	3751568	M-Mode would be, I believe, the AT&T... That's not Sprint.
3751888	3752268	Sprint is...
3752828	3755110	But it's just, they're MIDI files, I mean, come on.
3755170	3756571	I mean, any phone should be able to download that.
3756651	3757131	That's awesome.
3758732	3761234	So that's your... I can't find my clip of Girls Butts.
3761834	3766657	I'm downloading, I have a thing downloading right now, which I will actually give to you if you give me my flash drive back.
3766677	3767137	Thank you, I will.
3767718	3775823	That's a 20 second clip of about 13 to 20 different songs, and you'll be able to hear a lot more of what's going to be in there right now.
3775903	3779185	So I guess I'll throw it on here, and we'll play it later.
3779445	3780326	Okay, we can do that.
3782489	3783010	Sounds good.
3783450	3784311	So we'll play that later.
3784351	3785111	More Neon FM.
3785752	3786953	Any idea when they're going to release this?
3787654	3789295	Any word of a release date yet?
3789476	3789796	Not yet.
3790416	3795401	We need to talk to somebody over on the team over there and try to get somebody on this show to give us details.
3796182	3796342	Okay.
3799164	3801346	and I also want girl's butts dedicated to me.
3801806	3805528	I was going to say some other stuff non-related.
3806549	3812053	I have a Myspace site, another one now, that I've been plugging in our LiveJournal community.
3813974	3818397	Actually, it's Myspace.com slash LokiFusion.
3818457	3825002	You can actually listen to brand new songs on there as they come out and I don't upload them to my really shitty site.
3825322	3830355	And plus I have a really cool logo that looks just like the DDR Ultramix 3 logo.
3831919	3832520	It's spiffy.
3835064	3838145	Um, so go check it out, befriend me, do all that wonderful stuff.
3838385	3848668	Um, also, if you play Step Mania, um, someone actually made a sim file for, um, what was it, uh, The Legend of Trance 2005, so go check that out, Bomani style.
3848988	3851289	That's a few pages back in their sim file section there.
3852209	3855730	And... Which technically would count as another max sim file.
3855750	3856670	Good job, guys.
3857390	3859471	Bastards.
3859731	3862992	The background art, though, kind of sucks, but, you know.
3864412	3864733	Anyways.
3865073	3868495	And then, other than that, really, not too much else going on.
3870616	3871216	I think I found it.
3871476	3871996	I think I found it.
3872097	3872537	Oh, God.
3872857	3873937	Rob found girl's butts.
3874318	3875098	On his computer.
3875919	3876659	This is it, right?
3878160	3878920	I have no idea.
3879100	3879781	I think this is it.
3880361	3880641	Yes!
3883262	3885184	Wanna know what I did today?
3885324	3886944	I was looking at girl's butts.
3887845	3889986	Hanging out in the subway.
3890106	3891427	Looking at girl's butts.
3892566	3895068	This is right here the song of the game.
3895088	3895068	... ...
3924178	3930783	Now how can you not be excited about Neon Feet Mania after hearing that?
3931204	3935547	Now that's not the same mix though, because that doesn't sound like Thomas Howard.
3935627	3937289	That sounds like DJ Potato singing that.
3938577	3939157	Am I wrong?
3939297	3939997	I have no idea.
3940057	3941878	I think that's DJ Potato actually singing that.
3942238	3943638	It might be DJ Potato singing.
3943958	3947539	But the new one, I mean, I've got to say that they're doing quite a bit.
3947619	3951539	I mean, they're putting quite a lot of polish in this game.
3951599	3955200	I mean, getting a live performance of Thomas Howard in Japan with the other artists.
3955280	3959001	And apparently there's a female artist that does vocals on that song as well.
3959781	3965562	I want, like, really, like, 80s porn, like, close-up shots of her butt in, like, tight clothing and stuff.
3966798	3967918	It has to be porn style.
3969099	3970839	Even DarkSakura agrees with me.
3971259	3971900	Oh my god.
3972940	3973440	Picture this.
3973460	3974760	He's got to be all pimped out.
3974861	3977601	This one yells at me every time.
3977621	3983523	I even mention they should objectify women in one form or another, and she agrees with me on this one.
3984784	3987925	This song has to have it, and the guy has to be all pimped out.
3988205	3989705	Then the girl has to turn around and shoot him.
3990065	3992606	I've got your video right here.
3992646	3995987	You need to have a really quick close-up shot of a door opening.
3996351	3999633	and Thomas Howard singing the song is the pizza guy.
4003036	4004277	That would be fucking awesome.
4004357	4006018	I still think the girl needs to go around and shoot.
4008540	4010862	They should parody a bunch of different porno videos.
4010882	4011922	The pimp should be a girl.
4012823	4014744	Just when I thought it was going to be a train wreck of a show.
4015785	4016706	I found girl's butts.
4016986	4017646	I'm going to be happy.
4019491	4021893	We're going to have the Skype line open very soon.
4022113	4029140	www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on... Interact with us for more information on the Skype line.
4029600	4036066	I almost said click on girl's butts, but I... We don't have that on Orange Lounge.
4037247	4039089	We need a girl's butts button.
4041031	4043513	That should be the marketing for the game.
4043593	4045715	They should have that printed on bumper stickers.
4047950	4051092	It should just be Neon FM and really tiny print in the corner.
4051132	4056695	Neon FM featuring Girls Butts with a Z. That song.
4057135	4057515	Awesome.
4057616	4059156	That song needs to go on the radio.
4060817	4063499	Maybe we should help them out.
4063899	4065660	We've got some artistic people on staff here.
4065961	4067922	Let's make some Neon FM promo banners.
4068922	4069483	And we'll do that.
4069503	4072404	A little Neon FM featuring Girls Butts.
4072445	4073485	Really huge.
4074106	4075426	And then have the 80s porn butt.
4075807	4076467	I think we should do that.
4077322	4081267	We'll do it as a favor to Neon FM, and then maybe some of them will come on the show and talk about their game.
4083230	4083891	I like this idea.
4084612	4085313	It has merit.
4089318	4090519	I think we'll go to a quick break.
4091140	4093844	When we come back, we are going to take your calls over on the Skype line.
4094955	4096676	www.orangeloungeradio.com
4118186	4119147	That might not be a bad idea.
4119268	4127941	I have a feeling that if we do that, we will be taking an inside joke or a joke that was five minutes ago and just be ramming it into the ground.
4128762	4129323	That's okay.
4129443	4129663	All right.
4129924	4130244	We'll see.
4131469	4139114	Okay, in this break, I thought maybe what we could do is actually play some In The Groove music this break, because we've kind of been mean to them this week.
4139134	4139975	Has In The Groove come out yet?
4140055	4154584	Because apparently, and this is interesting, apparently, someone I know at work, they're like, you know, I'm looking for a DDR game that has some Britney Spears songs in it, because my daughter, daughter's a 10-year-old, okay, now she's into the Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera crap,
4155214	4157376	Um, they're looking for a song that had some of that stuff.
4157416	4159557	So I'm loaning her DDR Extreme Max 2.
4159817	4161659	In return, she's loaning me In The Groove.
4162719	4163180	What?
4163300	4164100	For the home console.
4164340	4165381	Apparently she already has it.
4165441	4166482	She says that's what it is.
4167162	4173947	She says it looks exactly like DDR, except it does, you know, I showed her pictures of In The Groove and she's like, I'm almost positive that's what it is.
4175214	4183866	If it is, that's very odd, because I haven't heard of it coming out yet, and it would be all over if it had come out.
4184307	4184667	We'll see.
4184868	4185849	Let me check, let me check.
4185889	4188333	In fact, let me just make sure I haven't missed something, okay?
4188553	4192198	ITGFreak.com, because this site would have it, right?
4193022	4194002	Let's see.
4194942	4195102	Nope.
4195643	4197183	No news on the home version coming out.
4197643	4202664	Your co-worker's insane or has gotten some huge break somehow.
4203104	4204264	I don't know what she has.
4204364	4207305	I bet you anything it's MC Groove's dance craze.
4207605	4208505	Oh my god.
4208985	4210645	That's probably what you're going to get in return.
4211685	4215166	Either way, we'll have a review of whatever the hell it is that she has.
4217446	4218907	Some subpar game.
4220447	4220707	What am I...
4224530	4225370	What am I looking for in this room?
4225390	4228533	The girl's butt thing just totally inspired me to open a restaurant.
4229193	4229673	Called what?
4230394	4234417	Well, you know, this objectifying women thing is pretty stupid.
4234477	4235958	I think that men should be objectified.
4236359	4237840	So I'm opening a restaurant called Heckers.
4238600	4240101	Hey, there's no problem with that.
4240282	4241022	Or Bananas.
4241623	4242964	It was in a commercial a while ago, I think.
4243124	4245385	But it's a chicken restaurant like Hooters, so it's going to be Heckers.
4247147	4247527	All right.
4248208	4251070	I thought about a cool pool hall called Great Wreck.
4251900	4253321	No, Jailbait
4284252	4284552	All right.
4284993	4285293	Whatever.
4285773	4286974	I think we're going to go to that break now.
4287455	4287675	Okay.
4287875	4288135	All right.
4288976	4292239	We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
4293600	4295061	And we're going to start this break off.
4295361	4296542	I said we'd do some in the groove music.
4296562	4301766	We're going to start it off with a little trancy song called Walking on Fire because we haven't played this one yet on the show and it's kind of neat.
4302207	4304769	So enjoy this and we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio.
4328303	4352045	The whisper in the breakdown Is the part of everything behind me Unexplained nature of the heaven Crushing every feeling that sends me
4548240	4556634	Touch me, I wanna know if you know that I need you And you need me too Ah yeah, ah yeah
4629216	4630759	I want you to touch me Hold me
4664225	4679338	I want you to touch me I want you to touch me I am a robot, a fucking robot Walking on the spaceship every night and day
4693946	4695187	I'm Romeo, I'm Juliet
4720979	4721701	Thank you for watching!
4753576	4758241	The first time that I walked in my life, I felt a strange attraction.
4758281	4758922	Felt a strange
4785020	4788621	Gaming Radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
4788722	4789462	Orange Lounge Radio.
4814158	4816800	We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4817801	4820143	Some music there from Integroove.
4822025	4823967	Coming to a console near you eventually.
4825248	4826369	Romeo and Juliet.
4827049	4828070	Before that, Touch Me.
4828831	4829511	Bubble Dancer!
4830272	4831854	Walking on fire starting that set off.
4832454	4834496	A little diverse stuff in there.
4835417	4840301	I like Bubble Dancer because it sounds like Aqua, but like a real cheap Aqua knockoff.
4841434	4847226	Which makes it even worse, but at the same time, the only reason you liked Aqua is because it was one of those, it's so bad, it's good.
4847788	4849692	So when it gets badder, it gets gooder.
4851977	4852357	Nevermind.
4853479	4858684	We're going to take your calls right now on the Skype line, www.orangeloungeradio.com.
4858724	4862248	Click on Interact With Us and you can call into the show.
4862308	4869035	Although I don't know if we have a lot of people that want to talk to us tonight because we don't have a lot of folks that are actually logged into Skype right now.
4869155	4870997	So we'll see what happens.
4871897	4872498	I don't know what's going on.
4899437	4902198	Yes, on Fridays over at DDR Freak, if you want.
4903238	4905619	And you know, if no one calls us, we have to get into Paris Hilton chat.
4905919	4906940	And I don't think you want that tonight.
4906960	4907420	No, I'm kidding.
4908520	4910461	Even I'm sick of Paris Hilton chat.
4910781	4912081	Nicole Ritchie chat, though.
4912702	4913942	I've got a whole lot I could say about that.
4914002	4914642	She sucks.
4915883	4917503	She's Paris Hilton's partner.
4917583	4919944	Oh, we're getting... Oh, on that stupid show.
4919964	4920184	Yeah.
4920284	4921945	I watched the sausage episode.
4922025	4922565	Not anymore.
4922645	4923485	Saved by the call.
4923806	4924946	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
4925766	4926206	Hey, Scott.
4926226	4926647	Siggy here.
4926707	4927307	Hello, Siggy.
4927327	4927667	How are you?
4929127	4929947	I'm doing fine.
4930728	4931749	What's on your mind, sir?
4933051	4937375	Well, yeah, last Friday I was able to attend the World Series of Poker.
4938216	4942740	Oh, yes, I remember you talking about that on last week's show, and you were going to win us millions of dollars, right?
4943842	4946044	Unfortunately, I lost on the second level.
4946264	4946645	Damn it!
4947352	4948513	Well, at least you got to the second level.
4948553	4953696	Which is going to be one of my FUs of the week tonight.
4954117	4955538	How bad did you lose?
4956038	4962562	How exactly, I mean, I don't know how tournament poker works, but I guess, how many people do you play against at a time in tournament poker?
4963443	4969147	There were 240 tables, and there were nine players, and I just multiplied it by nine.
4969567	4970508	Oh my gosh.
4972279	4977163	You won out of nine people in the first round, right?
4977883	4978784	Well, yeah.
4978804	4980805	I already won over two tables.
4981245	4981606	Oh, eh.
4982506	4983067	That's not bad.
4983747	4986149	But unfortunately, I lost to a professional poker player.
4986749	4988650	Oh, well, that always kind of sucks.
4989571	4991652	So you got up there a little bit then.
4991732	4992613	That's still pretty cool.
4993193	4993714	Good job.
4994414	4994935	Maybe next year.
4994955	4995615	Yeah, maybe next year.
4995635	4996676	There goes my $1,000 buy-in.
5000622	5002923	Oh my god, it was $1,000 to buy in?
5003543	5004423	Yeah.
5005063	5006584	Oh my god, you didn't get any of it back.
5007744	5008304	Well, no.
5009225	5008304	$1,000?
5009345	5012806	For a freaking poker?
5012886	5014246	Here's the thing, here's the thing.
5014426	5015687	The top prize is $725,000.
5015727	5016227	Wow.
5016587	5027110	And then there's going to be another No Limit tournament this Friday, which is going to be a $2,000 buy-in, and it's going to be twice.
5027870	5029451	Twice than that for the top prize.
5029571	5029831	Wow.
5030782	5031522	That's pretty hardcore.
5031542	5034424	Can you imagine a DDR tournament with $1,000 buy-ins?
5036625	5039066	At least you could have a DDR tournament that has more than that one.
5039326	5043088	That's like just under half of my monthly salary.
5044949	5045769	That's crazy.
5046449	5047330	Well, what do you expect?
5047370	5048070	It's Vegas, right?
5048850	5049190	Yeah.
5050111	5050411	All right.
5050651	5053853	What do you have to say to the people that are criticizing you for putting up $1,000 of your money?
5056192	5060134	Well, it's just, you know, I've already planned this for months now.
5060874	5063315	Everybody has their thing, right?
5065276	5067037	You're allowed to spend money on poker.
5067297	5074300	Some people invest their money in their video game collections or their anime collections, so you have the right to spend your money on a poker tournament if you want, right?
5075080	5077321	Yeah, I'm doing it just for the fun of it.
5077401	5080743	I want to experience what poker players do.
5080763	5081563	There you go.
5081583	5085205	What's a really good poker game for the... I'm sorry, finish your thought?
5087038	5088019	No, you finish it up.
5088079	5089801	Okay.
5089921	5094084	What's a really good poker game for, like, home, consoles, video games?
5094104	5095525	Because there's a whole lot of them out there.
5095885	5097206	What do you think is a really good poker game?
5098147	5105253	Well, I say you should start with, you know, like, a low-limit Hold'em or, you know, low-limit Omaha.
5106234	5107615	But it's more complicated.
5107755	5109717	I'm talking about, like, a video game out there.
5109737	5112179	Because the E3, it looked like there were a lot of poker video games.
5112739	5115761	The World Poker Championship for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox.
5116082	5116302	Oh, cool.
5117840	5118801	I hear that one's really good.
5119121	5123785	What's the one that, does anybody remember there was one that Iguana Girl beat some guy at?
5123825	5125286	What was the game they were playing?
5125326	5126287	I can't remember his name.
5126307	5127307	Let me ask her real quick.
5127487	5128288	Okay, sounds good.
5128688	5129269	Chatting with her right now.
5129369	5130550	You know what it comes down to?
5130890	5132411	You need to play more strip poker games.
5132531	5132751	Why?
5132771	5135493	Because they make you fucking work to get those women naked.
5135954	5138896	And goddammit, it's not like any ordinary strip poker game, you know,
5139411	5140752	Phil Hellmuth, Howard Lederer, Greg Raymer
5169710	5191141	ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
5198846	5199888	I was tired.
5200790	5206423	You know, before I headed to Rio, I went to Circus Circus for some 2GX Red action.
5207305	5209189	Just to calm my nerves down.
5211235	5211495	Thank you.
5211515	5211695	Thank you.
5240814	5242134	Alright, let's go ahead and take another call.
5243215	5244155	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
5245155	5246756	Hey, what's up, Mr. One and Only Ranma?
5246876	5247716	Hello, Ranma.
5247776	5249236	How are you, buddy?
5249816	5250917	Hi, Uke-chan.
5254277	5256038	Warning, cute factor approaching.
5257638	5258599	What's on your mind, my friend?
5259899	5260379	Not much.
5260419	5262220	I just had a real twisted weekend.
5262960	5264900	I was forced to quit my job.
5265420	5267521	You were forced to quit your job?
5268422	5273726	Did somebody catch you in the storeroom with the lady, you know, something like that going on, or what?
5274386	5276948	No, I actually caught somebody else violating corporate policy.
5278329	5279069	Okay, how's that work?
5279109	5280010	You've got to explain this one to me.
5280710	5283152	Okay, on Geek Squad, you've got to sell services.
5283572	5287174	One of the technicians was selling services, but he was pocketing the money.
5288435	5288795	Ooh.
5289376	5291377	So how does that mean you lose your job?
5293338	5297041	I'm still trying... More or less, I found that they were like...
5297506	5299267	Tracking me and following me around.
5299947	5304469	It seems that before I went to Anamaze, I told my general manager what was going on.
5304869	5307250	Got a customer to make a statement about what happened.
5307490	5308351	I made my statement.
5308771	5309171	Go away.
5309531	5310092	I come back.
5310372	5313413	I come to find out that one of the managers wants to talk to me.
5313733	5320076	It seems that I'm being accused of losing money in the department and I have an issue with not coming to work.
5322486	5327650	DarkSakura is a great... She can give you some good advice on where to go if you want to kick some butt.
5351644	5352704	Oh, I plan on it.
5352825	5353365	Yay!
5354045	5355486	Keep us posted on how that goes.
5355526	5356566	How's your gaming week been?
5357727	5358487	Pretty good, pretty good.
5358527	5362349	I got a controller, so now I've been playing PSO a little bit more than I should be.
5362629	5363269	Oh, Blue Burst?
5364049	5364309	Yes.
5364810	5367331	Now, DarkSakura, you had a fun time in Blue Burst tonight, didn't you?
5367351	5368431	Yes, you need to play with me.
5368451	5370672	I'm actually going to be starting an Orange Lounge radio team.
5371593	5371913	Okay.
5372333	5373053	Are you playing tonight?
5373733	5374254	Um, I can.
5375730	5380013	Okay, only listeners are allowed to come into this room.
5380773	5393880	I always play on Hyperion 7, and the room is Murdoch is question mark, and the password is God, with a capital G. Since I have the memory retention of a goldfish, I will be asking this a little bit later.
5394301	5394741	That's fine.
5394761	5398663	We'll try and post a reminder in the chat room towards the end of the show on PSO.
5399043	5399403	Sweet.
5399644	5400804	Well, have fun with that.
5400864	5401925	Anything else you want to share with us?
5402873	5408575	Oh, and remember I called a few weeks back and I told you about the slash pizza icon I saw at AMA Boston?
5408735	5408955	Yes.
5410136	5413537	I sent DarkSakura the picture so you could take a look at it.
5413977	5415158	DarkSakura, do you have those pictures?
5415438	5416978	You emailed those, right?
5417618	5418159	Yes, I did.
5418379	5420520	Okay, I can hop onto my email momentarily.
5420920	5422360	We'll take a look at them during the cage match.
5423341	5423641	Awesome.
5423741	5424681	All right, sounds good.
5424701	5427602	Thank you for giving us a call, and we'll talk to you next time, all righty?
5428362	5428763	You got it.
5428843	5429643	And good luck with that.
5431027	5432248	East Coast is waiting for you, Sky.
5432568	5434129	I'm going to be there with bells on.
5434389	5437111	If you need me to look up anything legal for you to help out, let me know.
5438252	5438952	I'll be asking.
5439253	5440153	Alright, have a good one.
5440774	5441274	Thanks a lot.
5441334	5441894	Bye.
5442455	5442795	Bye.
5442815	5444756	Alrighty.
5446377	5448159	Ranma calling in.
5448179	5449760	A little bit of work drama going on.
5451127	5457412	All right, what we're going to do now is we're going to go ahead and take a quick break away from the Skype line because we're actually going to go into tonight's cage match.
5457512	5461755	So what you have to do is if you want to call into the show, we will open it up.
5461955	5463916	Oh, there's one more call coming up.
5463936	5464657	We'll make this a quick one.
5465597	5466218	I'm going to be nice.
5466258	5467139	I'm in a nice mood today.
5467159	5468079	We'll take one more call.
5468119	5468660	Hi, who's this?
5469801	5470721	This is Reznor.
5471482	5472482	Like Trant Reznor?
5473703	5477306	No, I actually got the nickname from a mistake on somebody's part.
5477606	5478167	Oh, that's all right.
5478207	5479908	I bet you get that a lot, though, don't you?
5479928	5480008	Yeah.
5480729	5481550	Actually, no.
5482370	5484151	Everybody keeps saying, is it like the game?
5485532	5489053	I guess I'm the only ass out there that wants to do, alright, whatever.
5489274	5489794	What's on your mind?
5489814	5494276	Of course, then I follow up with, yeah, I've got the vibration paddle with me in my pocket, too.
5496668	5498449	Oh, because of Rez, okay.
5498589	5504734	It took me a minute, it took me a minute, and then I'm like, then when he starts talking about vibrating controller, I'm like, oh shit, yeah, I know that one.
5505035	5506576	I'm an expert on vibrating games.
5509158	5509538	Oh yeah.
5509638	5511160	What's on your mind, Reznor?
5511620	5514823	Well, drinking, games, stuff like that.
5515143	5517025	You were talking about Neon FM.
5517145	5517385	Yes.
5517565	5521709	I actually know the guy, DJ Potato, one of the creators of it, I know him really well.
5521809	5522810	Get him on my show.
5523830	5524230	I should.
5524270	5526971	He's actually staffing for us at MAGFest.
5527191	5528071	What's MAGFest?
5529512	5534933	MAGFest is a non-E3 commercial video game convention in Virginia.
5535753	5536073	Oh, cool.
5536093	5536693	When's that happening?
5537674	5538374	It's actually coming up.
5538594	5539954	We're skipping this year.
5540074	5541695	It's going to be in January.
5542155	5543295	Okay.
5543615	5546956	I think it's the weekend right before OhioCon, I think.
5547634	5551575	So do you get distributors to come out there and show off the games and everything?
5551955	5556336	Yeah, this will actually be our fourth year that we've been doing the convention.
5557136	5558896	First year was pretty good.
5558956	5561637	We had an anime premiere of Ys.
5562217	5567178	We had the first TurboGrafx-16 ever made on display.
5567258	5567698	I love you.
5568918	5570159	It actually had serial number 00001.
5572939	5575381	I want mine, please.
5575701	5576722	That's pretty hot.
5577342	5578863	I love the PC Engine.
5579103	5585667	I thought seeing the last Dreamcast ever made was pretty hot, but the first TurboGrafx, that's pretty hot as well.
5586127	5588709	Yeah, they had it in a little glass case and everything.
5589269	5593952	The con chairman said, yeah, you'll find me curled up in a ditch in Mexico with this.
5594432	5599355	It kind of sounds like what you've got going on is similar to Classic Gaming Expo.
5601170	5606252	Kind of, yeah, but more emphasis put on the fandom, kind of like anime conventions are.
5606332	5608153	This one's for video games only.
5608513	5609913	Oh god, do you have cosplayers?
5611954	5617237	Last convention we had three, and they got really pissy because we had to cosplay at two in the morning.
5620358	5626281	There was a really good Cosmos, but obviously for an anime convention...
5627068	5630089	Her mentality was definitely not the right one for this convention.
5630669	5639350	You can't have a convention, you can't have a geek convention happen without some rejected Ricky Lake guest doing Sailor Moon cosplay.
5640770	5643071	Thankfully, we didn't have any Sailor Moons or anything.
5643111	5644611	It was all video game characters.
5644651	5651932	We had, like, a Cid from Final Fantasy IV, and that was really cool when Tenebra Project played live.
5652332	5655833	He almost climbed up on stage when they were doing Final Fantasy IV boss.
5657237	5662044	For those that don't know, Jenova Project is the band that was before Mini Bosses.
5662765	5664288	We actually had them play live, too.
5664870	5666671	Wow, sounds like you guys have a good time out there.
5666711	5669211	I wish we were on the East Coast so we could check it out.
5669291	5674273	But maybe in January we'll have money in the travel budget.
5674373	5679194	So keep looking at the change that falls on the sofa because that's the travel budget.
5679215	5681415	We wouldn't be the only ones that would be coming from California.
5681475	5683756	We had about 50 people come from California.
5683796	5684376	That's nice.
5684636	5685176	That's nice.
5685997	5686417	Good deal.
5686637	5690158	Dude, if I was to go there, I would cosplay as King Hippo from Mike Tyson's Punk Out.
5692602	5695124	Dude, one of the most underrated 8-bit characters.
5695264	5696245	No, Eggplant Wizard.
5697186	5699007	We need Eggplant Wizard cosplay.
5699027	5702690	I actually want to cosplay as one of the guys from Russian Attack.
5703671	5704992	Oh, Akarnov, dude.
5705372	5707694	Are you a bad enough dude to save the president?
5709035	5710256	Let's get a cheeseburger.
5713171	5715953	We need a bunch of people to do Super Dodgeball cosplay.
5716834	5718535	Actually, I've seen people do it.
5718936	5724680	Or the Kunio-kun hot-blooded downtown story, also known as River City Ransom.
5725240	5730964	In EchoCon, there was actually a group of five people that cosplayed as the frat guys from RCR.
5732265	5732766	Wow.
5733366	5735328	Did they say barf when they hit the floor and everything?
5735728	5736809	Actually, they did.
5737149	5737649	They did.
5737749	5738750	It was really cool.
5739130	5739811	That's awesome.
5740578	5747264	They only did it because X-Strike Studios was showing RCR at River City Rumble at NekoCon, which is really cool.
5747684	5748265	Oh, wow.
5748445	5754390	Actually, I have one more idea, and that's to dress up as Leisure Suit Larry, the original OG.
5755591	5755871	Wow.
5755891	5758193	Yeah, give Spanish Fly to the secretary.
5758374	5760776	So how much floor space does this con take up?
5761877	5763318	We take up the entire hotel.
5763858	5764399	Oh, that's nice.
5764858	5766098	That sounds like fun.
5766118	5767199	24-hour game room.
5767819	5773401	Land room is actually going to be split into four rooms because last year I actually got it up to about 68 people.
5774441	5774722	Wow.
5774762	5780944	Well, you know, if our podcast takes off and we're able to sell out to the man and we get a travel budget, we are so there.
5781384	5782064	We'll check it out.
5782184	5782985	Travel budget.
5783025	5783485	Rock on.
5784365	5786446	Yeah, right now it's about five cents.
5787439	5789460	So you can get down the block, basically.
5789520	5795443	Actually, my other idea is to establish a swear jar, because that shit would fill up fast.
5795743	5796463	That would.
5796563	5798244	We'd be dropping 20s every night.
5798264	5799964	We'd be going to Hawaii every month.
5800945	5801305	All right.
5801645	5802726	Anything else you want to share with us?
5804666	5807027	Probably just pimping for X-Strike.
5807508	5810409	X-Strike Studios is going to be at AMA coming up in two weeks.
5811248	5817169	They're going to be premiering Silent Horror, a video game movie that doesn't suck based on Silent Hill.
5817829	5822010	Wait a minute, so it's like an actual movie that's going to be released in the studios?
5822110	5823351	I kind of saw this already.
5823391	5824011	What is this?
5824031	5824851	The trailer for it.
5826151	5827971	The trailer actually does no justice.
5828131	5830152	Okay, because the trailer kind of sucks.
5831292	5832812	The trailer does suck.
5833233	5835053	I was like, wow, this makes Uevo look good.
5836193	5840614	It's actually like, it's both funny as hell, because they make fun of every, like,
5841349	5845831	Any movie that has a line saying, it's like,
5864400	5865841	What are you doing with all that crap?
5865881	5874664	Well, you never know when you're going to need an empty lighter fluid can to fill up a lighter or a freakishly large statue to depress the switch.
5875044	5876825	It's good to have a well-stocked inventory.
5876865	5879726	Do they have a distributor for it, or are they still trying to find something?
5881386	5884107	It's actually, they're sending it off to the DVD pressers.
5884707	5885988	They're going with a different DVD...
5886913	5889254	Press and Company that they did for River City Rumble.
5890554	5893776	So it should be for sale at AMA.
5893816	5895636	It's actually going to kind of premiere at AMA.
5895836	5896316	Very cool.
5896336	5901798	Two commentaries, an outtake track, deleted scenes, director's commentary.
5902239	5903219	It's a fully loaded DVD.
5903516	5904597	Well, good luck to those guys.
5904637	5908840	I love B-movies with inside jokes, so that sounds like fun.
5908900	5910121	So it's a bunch of gamer nerds.
5910141	5911942	Make sure to watch the Transformer reference.
5912202	5913663	It's a bunch of gamer nerds that did this?
5914204	5915004	Oh, absolutely.
5915044	5915845	Oh, that'll be great.
5916445	5917126	It'll be great.
5917146	5919728	It's x-strikestudios.com.
5919968	5921809	x-strikestudios.com.
5921889	5922410	Sounds good.
5922650	5925112	Well, thank you for calling us, and I hope you have a good one.
5925212	5926052	Have fun at your con.
5926072	5926813	I need more beer.
5926933	5927333	Seven months.
5927373	5927774	All right.
5928154	5929795	Hey, have another bud for us, all right?
5930345	5931786	Oh, it's Killian's tonight.
5932226	5932626	Sounds good.
5932726	5933547	Actually, have a Guinness.
5933627	5936028	Have a Guinness for us, because the Guinness isn't really there.
5937269	5937549	All right.
5937569	5937909	Good stuff.
5937929	5938690	All right, have a good one, buddy.
5939590	5940210	All right, bye.
5940270	5940470	Later.
5941851	5944272	Getting his name from the Rez Trans Vibrator.
5944292	5945753	That's awesome.
5945793	5950736	That tiramisu's got, what is it, the liqueur in it.
5952874	5954416	It has booze, I must have some.
5954456	5963364	Okay, we're going to get some tiramisu as we get into Cage Match here because I don't really like tiramisu usually though, but is it Olive Garden tiramisu?
5963664	5964925	No, it's tiramisu from Rayleigh's.
5966306	5970450	I will have a small corner because I've eaten mostly meat all day.
5970670	5971411	I will give it a try.
5971531	5972872	I've eaten mostly meat today.
5975154	5979638	Of course, if I take this piece home and spread it out over the week, I can get away with it.
5982352	5984493	Alright, let's get into tonight's cage match, boys and girls.
5986894	6000121	Last week in the Orange Lounge cage match, the Gorillas were entered in, and they won in a narrow victory with their song, Dare, which is kind of a dance-y song, which you don't hear from Gorillas very often, but... Sounds like a happy Monday song.
6000341	6003563	It's very happy, but Mondays aren't happy, so I don't know what that's all about.
6003643	6003843	Alright.
6005051	6028239	Anyway, the way the cage match works, you must be in our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com We will play three songs for you, last week's winner, just a clip, because you already heard it last week, and two new songs in their entirety, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's video game music program, which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, on this station when we aren't live!
6029380	6033201	And what is the criteria for these songs to be in the cage match?
6034397	6035418	They have to kick ass.
6035898	6036899	We just have to like them.
6037039	6037940	That's the only criteria.
6037960	6039902	They don't have to be related to games at all.
6039982	6042404	It's just cool stuff we think you should hear.
6043045	6043505	So here it is.
6043586	6044847	A clip of last week's winner.
6044887	6045768	Song number one.
6045828	6047389	Is it worthy of a two-week victory?
6047429	6048150	You be the judge.
6048210	6049331	Gorillas dare.
6165633	6169376	All right, that was a clip of song number one, Dare, by the Gorillaz.
6169836	6173158	Okay, let's get into a new song, which we'll play in its entirety.
6173198	6174659	This one's six minutes.
6174919	6175939	This better be good, Loki.
6175960	6176640	What do you got for us?
6178735	6180796	Well, it's not a Girls remix, sorry.
6181096	6181556	Oh, sorry.
6182197	6183797	But see, now Girls Butts is okay.
6184138	6185818	Girls by Prodigy, not okay.
6186719	6201586	No, this is something I didn't really have much to bring this week, so I was going through some of my old CDs that have been ripping into my hard drive, and I found one on the Verse 1 and 2, which hit for me.
6202006	6206029	And this is a remix, and I don't even remember the title of it, because it's really strange.
6206609	6215334	And it's a remix of basically TAC stuff, and you've got... It's mainly DXY, but there's Thruanholic stuff in there as well.
6215554	6216935	I think I've heard this before.
6218236	6222058	It's Drexy, D-R-E-X-I-Y, I'm calling it Drexy.
6223239	6225640	Which sounds like an eating disorder to me, but whatever.
6226621	6226981	I don't know.
6227341	6231264	It's pretty cool, I mean, I was trying to find a short song...
6232941	6235383	Is the artist's name really VA on this?
6235743	6239565	No, that's just various artists because it's on Diverse Systems.
6240846	6243087	I can look it up, but I mean, it'd take me a sec.
6244288	6247950	But, yeah, basically, I mean, it should be enjoyable.
6247990	6249390	We'll just say it's by Diverse Systems.
6249430	6250551	So this is Diverse Systems.
6250831	6252332	If you like Taku, you should like this.
6252932	6253613	Alright, here it is.
6254593	6256974	Song number two in tonight's cage match, Drexy.
6257375	6257595	Enjoy.
6258666	6259108	Thanks for watching!
6355620	6356203	Thanks For Watching
6389362	6390532	Thanks for watching!
6477564	6478565	Thanks for watching!
6526938	6527743	Thanks for watching!
6581781	6582522	Thanks for watching!
6617000	6619901	Right, that was song number two tonight, Direxy.
6620081	6622502	Is that Direxy good or Direxy bad?
6622562	6623303	Let's find out.
6623343	6624243	DarkSakura.
6626504	6633967	I liked lots of parts of it, and you know me, I love Taku, but there were parts that just sort of kind of dragged on like that part at the end.
6639230	6639550	Seven.
6640830	6642351	Solid, but kind of drug a bit.
6644694	6645675	Uh, my vote.
6646296	6646776	Whatever.
6647156	6648698	I give it a six for the number of minutes.
6649038	6649378	Loki.
6650719	6652220	Next time I'm picking a ten minute song.
6652260	6656244	Oh, but I give the tiramisu a ten, by the way, because it tasted like liquor, and that makes me happy.
6657659	6661840	I thought it was a good song, just because it reminded me a lot of the Legend of Attack song they did a long time ago.
6662380	6669522	But, um, which I gotta do something else, because originally that Legend of Attack song was supposed to be every single Attack song in one mix.
6670142	6672823	But, uh, I stopped before I finished.
6673343	6676404	Anyway, um, no, I give it, like, an 8, because it's good.
6677344	6677744	Islander.
6680665	6684926	I'd probably give it about a 6-2, but then, because my reasoning is, it was, it...
6686164	6687647	I too feel this is a little too long.
6688609	6689550	We've done without a few things.
6690292	6690673	Alrighty.
6692011	6693512	Let's go on to song number three.
6693612	6700557	Song number three, somebody sent me the music video for this during the week, and it reminded me about how funny this song is.
6700857	6702939	So, and I love the video, it's so funny.
6703339	6706021	So, um, and it's actually a pretty decent dance song.
6706401	6713586	So, I chose this song, it's kind of like, I wouldn't say it's a remake of an 80s classic, but it invokes an 80s classic.
6714087	6717309	So this is Eric Pryde's, and the song is called Call On Me.
6718430	6718730	Enjoy!
6890851	6893713	Song number three, Eric Pryde's Call On Me.
6894113	6897715	Will you guys be calling that song back, or will you conveniently lose its number?
6897795	6898495	DarkSakura.
6898835	6901797	I love the original, but that one was also really repetitive.
6902017	6909161	It would be good for DDR, I think, if it were cut down to a minute and a half, but it was just too repetitive.
6909181	6910482	I think it's a six and a half.
6911568	6913890	It's a club song, supposed to be repetitive.
6913950	6923880	Actually, for me, it has the same elements of a Daft Punk song, where it's simple, it can be repetitive, but it's still catchy, and it doesn't get really annoying.
6924060	6928925	And that's what's cool about Daft Punk, and I think there may be even some Fatboy Slim songs like that and stuff.
6929345	6934310	But it's just, it's one of those songs that lends itself to a club scene very well, so it gets a 9.
6934390	6934690	It's good.
6935512	6941959	Sometimes I wish we were a TV show, because honestly, that song isn't done justice without the video.
6942199	6949868	Yes, isn't the video is all these, it's women working out and like they're wearing like Jane Fonda style attire.
6949908	6950949	It's like full on 80s.
6951229	6952050	But here's the thing.
6952471	6956675	Consistent tits and ass shots consistently through the video.
6957756	6960037	I remember the video for this, and that was hilarious.
6960077	6963837	And then there's just some random guy there, too, that's just working out.
6964177	6964578	It's funny.
6964718	6965078	I don't know.
6965778	6966298	I laughed.
6966398	6967958	Okay, I'm gay, and I thought it was funny.
6968358	6970199	But maybe it's the whole boobies thing.
6970239	6972419	I don't know, because they say gay men are infatuated with boobies.
6972819	6975940	Islander, who is not a gay man, but is still infatuated with boobies.
6976500	6977040	Oh, absolutely.
6979741	6984962	But no, I sort of agree there with Loki's comments, how it's...
6985552	6986973	It does lend itself to the club scene.
6987313	6991316	It's in that mold of Daft Punk and whatnot.
6992076	7000002	And if you don't mind hearing that type of music, I for one don't, I would bump that in my car.
7000062	7001363	I mean, I'd give that probably an 8.
7002558	7003759	All right, and eight for 80s.
7003979	7004359	How's that?
7004379	7004920	Absolutely.
7005020	7005480	Let's see.
7005980	7010063	Okay, so pretty diverse selection here tonight in the cage match.
7010123	7012224	Remember, our votes don't count for shit.
7012304	7014185	It's all up to you guys in the chat room.
7014546	7022951	So here it is, the three songs you can vote for tonight, starting it off with song number one, last week's winner, going for win number two, Gorilla's Dare.
7033953	7038778	And song number two you can vote for tonight, Diverse System with Direxy.
7048888	7052512	And song number three you can vote for tonight, Eric Pride's Call On Me.
7060978	7063861	All right, place vote now.
7063981	7067564	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
7067604	7069705	And if you don't know how to do that, hold on.
7069825	7072928	I'll tell you guys in our chat room how to momentarily.
7073568	7074929	You guys have about three minutes.
7075650	7080674	Loki, this is the part of the show where I let you explain what's going on in the sim world.
7080933	7083035	Well, I explained a little bit of what's going on in the sim world.
7083055	7090321	Like, for example, there's a sim file for my song, Legend of Trance 2005, which you can find on Bamayu's cell.
7090341	7093703	There's a few other things that happened as far as releases go.
7094564	7100389	There was, what was it, DDRXX Mix, and I know that's a,
7101061	7103523	Weird name, but it's Japanese, so what can we say?
7104284	7109008	They released version 2.5, which has some more songs in it.
7109508	7114532	It's actually a good 80 meg download, so you can go check that out as well.
7115533	7118775	Then there's also... There's another one.
7119536	7124340	It's actually kind of an older one that came out around the time Food Mix 1 came out.
7124981	7128063	And it's... Oh, what's it called?
7128123	7128243	It's...
7129344	7134529	Party Night, Dance Dance Revolution, I guess Party Night Edition or something like that.
7135429	7140173	They're calling it DDR Party Night Mix Appendix Series Number 1.
7140253	7149141	That's kind of a tongue twister, but basically what that is, is a good download for you that's about, oh, I don't know.
7149924	7153308	It's pretty big.
7153348	7154008	216 megs.
7154048	7156791	So that's quite the download there.
7156831	7157652	So go check that out.
7158713	7162117	Now, granted, the first Party Night mix was not very good.
7163317	7163718	DDR-D3 Mix 2.5
7183174	7184015	Manhole Manhole
7204477	7207078	Yeah, that's right, we do have the maturity level of preschool.
7207778	7219961	Anyways, yeah, that's pretty much what's going on in the sim scene right now, so check those out, and watch BomaniStyle's sim file database, because every now and then there will be a good one.
7220382	7227144	But in the meantime, you'll have to deal with ParanoiaTwist, Omega, and MaxEvo.
7229144	7229404	Enjoy.
7231405	7231885	Goody, goody.
7233786	7238949	Just a reminder, you boys and girls out there, we have a podcast where we talk about other games.
7239169	7242011	We talk about games that don't suck and the news you really want to know about.
7242771	7246713	That's available on our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com.
7246753	7253457	Just click on the Orange Lounge Radio to Go edition, which is over on the left-hand side, and you can download that.
7253557	7256899	And actually, that show's been very successful for us, so we're pretty happy about that.
7258380	7263103	Also, if you have a chance, give us a vote over on Podcast Alley because, you know, we like attention.
7263163	7268667	Even though that site is turning into one big popularity contest, hey, you know... We like popularity.
7268707	7269607	We like being popular.
7269888	7270448	Doesn't everyone?
7271248	7272429	So, give us a vote over there.
7272449	7274330	I'll paste a link in the chat room for you guys if you want to do that.
7274350	7278093	Oh, I completely forgot to mention earlier during my, you know, week stuff.
7278213	7284957	There was actually something... I mean, it's not, like, huge, but it was rather significant to happen this week.
7285678	7285818	Um...
7287273	7297039	Now, I may have made fun of this song earlier this week, or not earlier this week, but when we were talking about Karaoke Revolution 4, but Patrick Swayze came to my work.
7297319	7298620	How many people can say that?
7299320	7302362	Patrick Swayze came to my work as well as his wife.
7302422	7305063	It was on Channel 3 News local here in Sacramento.
7305704	7314729	And he was basically promoting his new movie that's going to be coming out called Last Dance, which is about his, I guess, you know, he started off classically trained as ballet.
7314849	7316330	That was a Donna Summer song.
7316821	7319723	Anyways, The Last Dance, it's going to be coming out.
7320504	7321544	Last Dance.
7322285	7323286	Last Dance.
7323406	7323766	I'm sorry.
7324106	7331271	Anyways, so yeah, I got an autograph and it's the same from his wife who actually directed and wrote the movie.
7331932	7336655	And he actually flew in on his plane into the Caron Park Airport nearby here.
7336735	7338316	So he's a pilot and all this stuff.
7339093	7342817	You know, I realize they did a sequel to Dirty Dancing, but overlooking that piece of crap.
7359793	7364875	They should do a new sequel to Dirty Dancing with Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey.
7366516	7368917	They need to give her back her old nose.
7369617	7380542	He's doing a movie right now, because this whole movie is supposed to be about going inside the mind of a dancer, what they're experiencing, so it's kind of a surreal movie in a sense.
7381382	7384483	Dirty Dancing Sequel with the DDR Freak Movie
7410503	7412403	Because you know how that always comes up.
7415264	7417225	OMG to DDR Freak Movie.
7417865	7418885	That's what it could be.
7418965	7425007	It could be Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey reunited to win to dinner competition.
7426067	7427127	That's ridiculous.
7431488	7433669	And then they can get to the competition.
7434209	7437570	And now for the final challenge where you will have to face...
7438891	7440652	Dark, Patrick Swayze.
7442874	7444134	DOTH Swayze!
7447997	7448938	Use the force.
7454221	7455802	Use the bar, Luke.
7462666	7463027	I can't.
7463187	7464047	I can't do this!
7465478	7465658	Direxy
7491477	7492398	All six minutes of it.
7492618	7500123	And song number two that tied in tonight's cage match was... Gorillas with Dare.
7502504	7510689	Now, the rules of a tie say that the host who put in the song that did not end up in the tie gets to break the tie.
7511370	7512510	That's me!
7513091	7516533	So I get to break the tie tonight because you bastards didn't vote for call on me.
7517013	7519535	So, who loves me more?
7521013	7522334	I buy you food sometimes.
7522894	7523995	I brought you cake.
7524195	7525916	That's true, you did bring me tiramisu.
7526036	7526837	I brought you liquor.
7527497	7532921	Uh, that's true, but, um, you know, Direxy just went on for way too long, so I have to give it to Dare tonight.
7532961	7533421	Woohoo!
7535362	7537043	But Dare's gone on for two weeks already.
7537063	7539585	Too late, I've made up my mind.
7539605	7543668	It has the mighty power of Sean Ryder and Damon.
7545689	7547210	Oh, we got a weird buzzy sound.
7548611	7550232	Alright, um, so there it is.
7553286	7557090	Win number two for Dare, so we'll be back next week to see if it can go through.
7557250	7558612	Dare to stay off drugs.
7560543	7561364	Didn't they have a report?
7561404	7564306	There are a lot of people singing that song to be saying that about.
7564726	7566888	You want to know what a geek I was in elementary school.
7566948	7569970	Think back to what year would this have been, like 89?
7571812	7572372	We had the D.A.R.E.
7572432	7573333	program in schools.
7573393	7576295	I don't know if this is a nationwide thing or just California, but D.A.R.E.
7576335	7579838	was the Drug Abuse Resistance Education.
7579958	7580879	I think that's what it stood for.
7580939	7582160	It was an anti-drug program.
7582360	7587904	But they say that it was an utter failure because what it ended up doing is it actually taught kids about all the drugs that was out there.
7589121	7590102	That's the ones that need to be funny.
7590202	7590863	Exactly.
7591383	7595107	Ooh, methamphetamine.
7595247	7595748	No, exactly.
7595768	7598571	I think it's a nationwide thing.
7598691	7603036	One of my ex-fiancé in Colorado, she was a DARE graduate twice.
7605558	7610944	Still ended up smoking, shooting up anything she can get her hands on.
7612591	7612971	Wow.
7613091	7613531	I don't know.
7614392	7619653	I'm going to go get me some drugs now.
7619773	7624035	Everybody in the chat room knows what I'm talking about, so they're all saying yes is nationwide, so cool.
7624955	7626795	For our international audience, sorry, you're just screwed.
7628696	7633841	Here's the thing, I don't know why I remember this, but I remember they had a little workbook that had all these exercises on it.
7633861	7635262	You're supposed to identify different drugs.
7635883	7638745	One of them was create your own license plate.
7639185	7641347	What that has to do with drugs, I don't remember.
7641868	7642208	I don't know.
7642468	7645371	I think it was like, if you go to jail, then you'll be making license plates.
7645391	7646372	You'll be making license plates.
7647372	7648893	So they had like a make your own license plate.
7648913	7653356	But if they wanted to be really realistic, you know, they'd have to have, you know, the rubber glove up the ass.
7653616	7655398	Yeah, yeah, seriously.
7655438	7658099	Cavity surge, bend over and spread them.
7658319	7663303	They'd have all us fifth graders take our clothes off and go shower publicly and have Bubba fuck us.
7664183	7665284	Teach you how to make hooch.
7668652	7670873	Here is a can of juicy juice.
7671394	7674956	Here is yeast that we use to make the hard tack you have to eat.
7675056	7676416	Okay, wait, I'm not done with my thought yet.
7676456	7681599	So we had to make a license plate, and the deal was, you know, you have to have it be eight letters.
7681639	7684661	So it was like, what would your license plate say, right?
7685221	7687703	My license plate was N-I-N-1-0-D-O.
7688003	7688823	N-I-N-1-0-D-O.
7688843	7688963	Get it?
7694400	7696301	You are such a nerd and I like that.
7697502	7699903	I wonder if anyone actually has that license plate.
7699923	7700844	Dude, I should get it.
7701984	7703525	Oh, if nobody has it in California yet.
7703585	7707448	Remember, Genesis does what Nintendon't.
7710449	7710709	Suck.
7712270	7714712	Sonic the Hedgehog, bitch.
7717273	7718014	Bad knuckles.
7719174	7721856	And by the way, Shadow the Hedgehog sucks ass, but he has a gun.
7723284	7725126	I'm just reading some comments in our chat room.
7725186	7725606	I love it.
7726006	7728728	Ron Chan says, super sloppy OLR double dare.
7729989	7732171	That's what dare makes you think of that show, Double Dare.
7733432	7736574	And then I still have my dare shirt.
7736634	7737195	That's awesome.
7737275	7738656	I didn't think they were still doing dare.
7739457	7743820	You know, I expect to see something like that at Hot Topic soon, because they're doing like all the... Yes!
7744360	7745080	They do have them!
7745140	7746381	They do have them at Hot Topic!
7746401	7746801	Do they?
7747122	7747482	Yes!
7747842	7748863	You know what would be awesome?
7748883	7749323	I love Hot Topic.
7749343	7755526	And then they also have the drug testing, and it has like a bunch of drugs sitting in a classroom.
7755546	7757388	You know what I want just for the hell of it?
7757568	7761290	I want those prop sandwiches that they had on Double there.
7761630	7764672	I just want two of those giant pieces of bread to put on my floor.
7765013	7765833	The foam bread.
7765853	7767875	I don't know why that would be so cool, though.
7768095	7768676	Dude, F that.
7768696	7769936	I want the giant hamster wheel.
7770637	7771378	Hamster wheel?
7771398	7772839	Oh my god, that would be cool.
7772859	7773779	You know what?
7774340	7776041	It's very funny, though, because what was his name?
7776081	7776662	Mark Summers?
7777322	7779164	He is supposedly such a neat freak.
7779704	7780665	Yeah, he's obsessive-compulsive.
7780685	7782626	I saw a story on some network somewhere.
7782826	7783127	Fuck that.
7783207	7786149	I want the big-ass nose that you would have to pick.
7786169	7786809	To pick this?
7787070	7788050	Oh, that was awesome.
7788331	7788651	Dude...
7790248	7793030	Every obstacle course had that damn hamster wheel in it somewhere.
7793671	7800237	Oh, I forgot to mention, a couple weeks ago on Family Guy, they actually referenced You Can't Do That Television.
7800257	7803519	Yes, I actually saw that episode, but we don't encourage people to watch Family Guy.
7803539	7804400	That was a couple weeks ago.
7804420	7807883	Yeah, it's on the same time as us, so we don't encourage people to go watch that.
7808503	7809024	TiVo it!
7809344	7811086	It's a good show, TiVo or BitTorrent.
7811146	7811346	Yes.
7812327	7814649	We encourage you to pirate Family Guy because it's our competition.
7814669	7817131	Hey, BitTorrent is mainly just free TiVo.
7817171	7818252	That's all it is to me.
7819363	7822564	Don't worry, I delete the episodes after 24 hours.
7822644	7824445	Yes, 24 hours so that you're not pirating it.
7825226	7825526	Love it.
7827507	7827827	Alright.
7829227	7830188	We're going to go to a break.
7830868	7834150	Featuring some music this break from Dance Maniacs.
7834310	7835710	What about the Hannah Wavy game?
7836010	7836551	What, what, what?
7837451	7839352	Oh yeah, you wanted to do the clips, didn't you?
7839852	7842353	We'll do the clips when we come back.
7842733	7843934	We'll do the clips when we come back.
7843954	7845735	We'll do the FUs of the week when we come back as well.
7846075	7848696	And hopefully list lists, but we're still trying to think of a topic, so...
7849693	7851094	You guys start thinking about that topic.
7854596	7854876	Alright.
7856217	7858698	We will come back after this break.
7858838	7860739	In this break, Dance Maniacs.
7861279	7862300	So, enjoy.

8227345	8227565	Hi.
8227625	8227845	Whoops.
8227885	8228085	Sorry.
8228105	8228625	We're still here.
8228805	8230326	We forgot to queue up a promo.
8230366	8230706	My bad.
8231186	8231846	Here's your promo.
8231866	8232887	My bad.
8232927	8233227	Here you go.
8243203	8248985	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
8250966	8253667	There you go.
8253807	8254327	Sorry about that.
8255187	8257468	I was too busy brainstorming for Listless.
8257548	8260950	We're actually going to allow a guest person to come on Listless tonight.
8262470	8267472	First person to call in Skype who wants to participate with this topic.
8268232	8272414	Nickelodeon show you want brought back tomorrow.
8273660	8277121	Okay, so we'll take whoever calls in first, wanting to play that.
8277401	8284764	The way listless works, everybody presents their top three, so when you call in, please have three shows that you want to do, ready to go.
8285764	8290466	And then we'll come up with our list, and then we each take one off the list.
8290506	8298949	You vote one off, and then the chat room ultimately gets the final vote when we have a list of eight that would be remaining.
8299689	8301629	If that makes no sense to you, don't worry.
8301750	8303630	It'll make sense to you as we start to go through it.
8305170	8307291	Let's see if we get anybody in on the Skype line.
8307311	8309571	Boy, our Skype line's lighting up now all of a sudden.
8309611	8310631	Let's take the first call.
8311051	8312112	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8314132	8314572	Hello.
8316913	8317813	Can you hear me, caller?
8319353	8320573	Oh, sucks to be that person.
8320593	8322694	Let's go ahead and take the next call that came in here.
8323014	8324134	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8324154	8324254	Hello.
8326516	8327177	Hey, it's Dubz.
8327377	8328878	Hey, Dubz, how you doing?
8328898	8330760	Woo, it's Dubz!
8331641	8335464	Alright, you wanna play listless with us tonight?
8336085	8336405	Sure.
8336625	8337586	Hot, alright.
8338807	8342150	Alright guys, stop hammering the Skype line, we got ourselves another player here.
8342190	8347575	But don't worry, all you guys in chat get to vote once we have a list here.
8347595	8349177	So have you heard listless before, Dubz?
8350945	8351365	Uh, yeah.
8351645	8352966	Then you know how it works, right?
8353206	8353586	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
8353646	8354967	Alright, are you thinking of your list here?
8355267	8356788	Nickelodeon show you want them to bring back.
8357288	8357548	Alright.
8357608	8360190	Yeah, um... Wait, wait, wait, don't give it away yet.
8360770	8362971	Think of your top three, and then we'll ask you for it.
8363011	8364952	But you have to justify your choices, alright?
8365813	8366193	Oh, I do?
8366433	8367093	Alright, yes you do.
8367413	8367694	Sucks.
8367854	8369995	Alright, let's get ourselves some theme music, shall we?
8378559	8380260	Let's get further down in the theme music here.
8384215	8388399	That's right everybody, it's time for tonight's listless!
8389880	8396967	Playing in tonight's listless is Sky, Loki, DarkSakura, and Doobs.
8397628	8401711	Islander didn't want to participate tonight because he didn't have Nickelodeon as a child, you poor bastard.
8402172	8402452	Alright.
8402973	8404314	I want to play Flinko!
8405775	8406376	Wrong show.
8407841	8409821	I found the tape, by the way, Rob.
8410061	8410501	What tape?
8410721	8412382	The tape of you on The Price is Right.
8412482	8413902	I wasn't actually on The Price is Right.
8413922	8414802	But I saw you.
8415342	8417663	Yes, I was in the audience at The Price is Right.
8417763	8418623	I had the tape with you on it.
8418643	8419783	All right, we'll talk about that later.
8419843	8420763	Let's get to Listless.
8421143	8422323	All right, who's starting us off tonight?
8422363	8423764	DarkSakura always starts us off.
8423804	8426244	So, DarkSakura, what is your number three pick?
8426444	8427564	Start this party up right.
8427604	8428444	Salute your shorts.
8432285	8435586	Brief description of the show, Salute Your Shorts, and why they should bring it back.
8435886	8437106	It has that redhead kid.
8438615	8441378	I wanna say the original Rugrats, like the actual one with their babies.
8459778	8460378	Yeah, that one.
8460458	8461419	Okay, Rugrats.
8461739	8463440	That was the cartoon with the babies.
8463520	8465021	All right, yeah, I should bring that back.
8465041	8465962	That's not still on?
8466782	8470325	They're all like teenagers and shit.
8470445	8472246	Oh, that's bullshit.
8472326	8473086	That's bullshit.
8474547	8475728	Loki, your number three pick.
8476649	8481532	My number three pick is going to be... Oh man, this is tough.
8483593	8484554	How about...
8485285	8485985	Pete and Pete.
8486466	8488827	Because it was a strange show, but it actually worked.
8488907	8490467	And the mom had a metal plate in her head.
8490647	8491068	Exactly.
8491168	8493209	It reminds me of Malcolm in the Middle.
8493689	8496750	It is basically, I think, is what became Malcolm in the Middle.
8496810	8498371	So, brief description of Pete and Pete.
8498431	8502493	Pete and Pete was just a story about two brothers that, you know, had the same name.
8502553	8503493	They're both kind of nerdy.
8503874	8506875	The one brother had a tattoo that he used to make dance.
8506895	8508616	The mother had a metal plate in her head.
8509076	8510357	She could receive radio signals.
8510657	8512157	She could receive radio signals.
8512257	8513358	And it was just such a weird...
8514058	8515359	Weird Show, but it worked.
8515659	8519300	It was just one of those shows that actually had a pretty good storyline to it, so it worked.
8519600	8520741	Alright, Pete and Pete, you're number three.
8520761	8521541	Goddammit, I was going to say that.
8521801	8523522	Well, you've got time to think of another one, dudes.
8523802	8526863	Alright, my number three I'm going to pick is Hey Dude.
8529625	8532986	Because Hey Dude had the chick who married Ben Stiller, like, years later.
8533186	8534166	Christine Taylor, remember?
8534206	8534527	Hello?
8534947	8535567	She was hot.
8537288	8539429	And Hey Dude was about a dude ranch.
8539529	8542450	She was also in, um, what was that, uh,
8543595	8544015	DarkSakura
8566491	8569494	My number two one is Out of Control.
8570955	8573277	It's just an interesting Canadian show.
8573457	8577661	It had a guy who looked a lot like Mark Summers in it and had, what was her name, Driz?
8578666	8581848	Yeah, oh man, when I was a kid I could do it.
8583129	8583969	I can't do it anymore.
8583989	8586771	And she used to tell the super fast jacked up fairy tales.
8586811	8587712	I went through puberty.
8589453	8590834	That was the sound she used to make.
8590854	8593395	And she used to do the really funny jacked up fairy tales.
8593715	8594336	You remember that?
8594796	8595076	Yes.
8595516	8600439	And that show was just, it was, you know, it always came on right after You Can't Do That on television.
8600459	8602541	And Dave Coulier cut it out.
8602701	8603301	Hello.
8603761	8604022	Hello.
8605719	8608601	And I always was like, okay, this show is awesome.
8608881	8610243	And so, yeah, that gets my number two.
8610263	8614766	And it had the Python-esque animation in it.
8615907	8618870	I was going to say, figure it out.
8619630	8622332	That show was awesome.
8622353	8631000	It was that game show where these kids would come up and they'd have talents and people had to figure out what their talent was by asking them questions and stuff.
8631260	8631380	Yes.
8634062	8634902	Yeah, her, yeah.
8634962	8636463	Dude, she went to my high school.
8637303	8639284	She graduated the year before I was a freshman.
8639324	8643085	She came back and spoke, like, years later, and so I always find that funny.
8643125	8643605	I don't know why.
8643865	8644985	Follow your dreams.
8645045	8646566	You can't reach your goals.
8646926	8647666	I'm living proof.
8647846	8649447	Her dad's a dentist somewhere near here.
8649507	8649827	I don't know.
8649847	8651247	And then she did VO5 commercials.
8651287	8652007	All right, figure it out.
8652708	8654468	Um, Lokes, oh wait, is it my turn?
8654488	8655088	No, it's Loki's turn.
8655108	8656069	Loki, your number two pick.
8656489	8657309	I thought it was Doob's turn.
8657389	8658349	Oh, he just went, okay.
8659010	8663231	Um, sorry, I had a big mouthful of breadstick at the moment.
8663591	8663851	Anyways,
8664942	8667543	My next pick would be... Oh, man, I just had it, too.
8669924	8670704	Oh, I remember now.
8672925	8679647	Since Eerie Indiana wasn't on Nickelodeon, as far as I'm aware, it might have been at one time, but I don't think so.
8680187	8681627	So, Are You Afraid of the Dark?
8681987	8685969	But, like, the first season of Are You Afraid of the Dark before got really crappy.
8686609	8691050	You know, that's what... And this show is basically, they told, you know, kind of like ghost stories.
8691090	8692671	It's almost like the stupid, um...
8693633	8696535	Goosebumps book thing, you know, but it's better.
8698016	8698716	I hate that show.
8699777	8703279	Well, dupes, you might know which one you want to bump off then because you get to take one off the list.
8703439	8704760	All right, well, hold on.
8704800	8705761	There could be worse ones.
8705781	8706081	We'll see.
8706461	8707662	My number two pick.
8708423	8710064	Hello, Nick Arcade.
8710284	8710744	Hello.
8711104	8711485	Hello.
8712469	8712849	DarkSakura
8738061	8739962	Mine is Danger Mouse.
8741163	8743004	I fucking love Danger Mouse.
8743584	8744664	Danger Mouse is pretty awesome.
8744684	8747866	Because it's all about Penfold.
8749227	8756731	I was just watching a tape of Danger Mouse episodes I have at my house, and it was the one where Penfold gets into the giant chicken feed and turns into a giant Penfold.
8759572	8760312	That's pretty awesome.
8760633	8760873	Yeah.
8762473	8762914	Wait, hold on.
8762954	8764054	I have something just for you, Jamie.
8764394	8764675	Hold on.
8765115	8765355	Hold on.
8766838	8767398	Oh, damn it.
8767538	8767738	Hold on.
8768939	8769699	Way to go, Rob.
8769759	8770820	Have the volume down when you play this.
8771240	8771880	Penfold.
8772441	8772821	Shush.
8774161	8774562	Just for you.
8774602	8775782	All right.
8775862	8777243	Doobs, your number one pick.
8778383	8778844	All that.
8778864	8783306	Oh, God.
8785107	8785687	I'm sorry.
8785827	8787888	Brief description and why it should be there.
8788482	8791205	It was like a... I say mad TV for kids.
8791225	8792886	It was like one of those variety hour type shits.
8792927	8793827	It still is.
8794488	8795009	DOOBS HELP!
8795209	8796850	I'm saying... Okay, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
8796911	8798132	Oh, Han, let me say this.
8798172	8801215	I want all that to come back before it had all those preppy white people on it.
8805159	8805839	He's got a point.
8806100	8806981	He does have a point.
8807978	8808959	Yeah.
8809179	8812282	Islander, he said he wants it before the preppy white people ruined it.
8812602	8812903	Alright.
8813543	8815725	Pretty white, damn those pretty white people.
8815965	8817206	Pretty white people with phones.
8818147	8821650	No, I mean, I mean, like, um, like, I know they have, uh, Britney Spears' sister on it now.
8821670	8822952	I was like, whoa.
8823652	8826635	I mean, I remember the first couple episodes, it was all like, I remember they had, um,
8827315	8829556	That girl from TLC sang for the intro.
8829576	8832337	I was like, ooh, this is, like, hip-hop type.
8832357	8833738	Now I hear, like, you know.
8835218	8837819	It's like, you know what it reminds me of?
8838400	8840240	What he's talking about reminds me of Club MMC.
8843573	8846355	Never mind, forget it.
8846395	8847937	Click, click, click, ding.
8848137	8853541	Yeah, but then remember when it was MMC and it was all like, you know, like, we're hip and we're white and dance hip-hop.
8854842	8856724	My friend's mom was a Mouseketeer for a day.
8857825	8858025	Wow.
8858476	8858716	Roundhouse
8890097	8890818	Roundhouse.
8890878	8893599	Yeah, we saw a guy from Roundhouse at E3.
8893800	8894940	Yeah, the guy from Roundhouse.
8894960	8901745	At least those guys have friggin' talent versus, you know, all that where, we're trying to be like Sarah not live, but for kids.
8902706	8906168	And who can forget the guy from Roundhouse at E3?
8907269	8909470	Konami, Konami-yo.
8909490	8913533	That was him?
8913713	8915634	Yes, he was one of the pretty white kids on Roundhouse.
8916115	8916695	That was him.
8917055	8917876	All right.
8918276	8919257	And Shane loved him.
8919560	8921321	Yeah, Shane has a crush on him, but that's another story.
8921601	8925644	All right, time for my number one pick, and there's so many good ones you could choose from.
8926384	8932248	But, man, screw you all for not naming this show sooner, because this is the king of Nickelodeon shows.
8932288	8933328	There is no doubt about it.
8933909	8936930	Without it, you would not have Green Slime, ever.
8937070	8939452	You can't do that on television, is my number one pick.
8939472	8940432	I was saving it for you.
8940452	8940993	I knew you were picking it.
8941013	8942674	I didn't name it because I knew someone else would.
8943174	8946956	And besides that, who else but me is going to say Danger Mouse?
8947797	8948137	All right.
8949096	8952678	If you can't do that on television and had been taken by somebody else, I would have said Count Duckula.
8953519	8954699	We'll have to do that on our show.
8954719	8957301	You would have no Count Duckula without Danger Mouse.
8957521	8957801	I know.
8957841	8962924	If our show is ever live, we are going to do the green slime if you say I don't know.
8963865	8965125	Did you ever see the computer one?
8965465	8967186	It said, aha, I have a way around.
8967647	8968827	That does not compute.
8969348	8969988	Gray slime.
8970268	8979652	Alright, alright, let's... I remember the red slime and blue slime, and I remember the episode where you could vote by touching your TV.
8979772	8980372	Never mind, anyway.
8982153	8983413	I'm showing my age here, people.
8983934	8985674	Alright, here's the vote-off round.
8985754	8987355	This is going to be a hard one tonight, you guys.
8987415	8989736	You have to take one of these off the list.
8989916	8992557	Salute your shorts, Rugrats, Pete and Pete.
8992877	9002560	Hey dude, out of control, figure it out, are you afraid of the dark, Nick Arcade, Danger Mouse, all that, Roundhouse, and you can't do that on television.
9002600	9004160	DarkSakura, what's gotta go?
9005981	9011302	Move your big head out of the way.
9012622	9013483	Are you afraid of the dark?
9014043	9018004	Are you afraid of the dark gets taken off the list by DarkSakura.
9018744	9021905	And you knew the dupes was gonna take it off, so you just gave them a free pick.
9023098	9023358	Thank you.
9023378	9024679	He can pick his nose, too.
9024799	9026499	All right, dudes, which one's going to come off?
9028800	9029380	Hey, dude.
9030061	9030821	Oh, you bastard.
9030861	9032101	All right, hey, dude comes off.
9032181	9035623	Just because I'm too young to remember anything that happened on that show.
9036263	9037523	I was going to say, how old are you?
9037563	9040405	Because your picks are more new school Nickelodeon in my eyes.
9040625	9044486	Well, I'm actually 14, but I didn't watch Nickelodeon much.
9044846	9046727	You know what?
9046967	9047587	F you, okay?
9048067	9048428	F you guys.
9049088	9052049	Rob, actually, it was pointed out to me that not a one of us mentioned Invader Zim.
9053230	9053951	Ah, dammit!
9054551	9055271	Oh, Loki.
9057312	9060374	I say we have a unanimous vote to put Invader Zim on the list.
9062075	9062675	All of us vote?
9062955	9063656	Fine, fine.
9063696	9064936	We'll put Invader Zim on the list.
9064996	9065617	Woohoo!
9066477	9068158	God, I'm so bad.
9068258	9069359	Now that's new school, Nicola.
9069379	9071200	Alright, Loki, take one of these off the list.
9071600	9078124	Dammit, you know, these took off my Hey Dude Because I Was Gonna Say That Show bit compared to, you know, like, say, Sleezy Shorts.
9078604	9080625	But I'm gonna take off Rugrats because...
9081756	9085720	I mean, that used to be on, was it, you know, Nick Jr.
9086040	9088022	And that's where it needs to stay, is Nick Jr.
9088703	9090524	It needs to be back there by pinwheel.
9091765	9092466	Spinning around.
9092786	9094948	Pinwheel, pinwheel, spinning around.
9094968	9095509	My turn, huh?
9096189	9100573	I'm gonna have to take off, um... I'm gonna take off Roundhouse.
9100954	9101194	I just...
9103305	9105966	There's too many sketch comedy shows on Nickelodeon.
9106026	9106646	Nah, I do.
9106686	9107687	I have excellent taste.
9107767	9108847	You can't do that on television better.
9109167	9115250	What would you do on that stupid... Nobody said Double Dare, but I guess they have a new version of Double Dare.
9115310	9116230	Lots of shows not named.
9116291	9116611	Alright.
9117231	9119992	Here it is, the list that you guys can vote on.
9120092	9121013	Salute your shorts.
9121433	9122753	Pete and Pete.
9122873	9124214	Doobs, what the hell are you doing over there?
9125256	9126717	I don't know, my thing's just messing up.
9127298	9128979	Alright, that's alright.
9129079	9135564	Salute your shorts, Pete and Pete, Out of Control, Figure It Out, Nick Arcade, Danger Mouse, all that.
9135925	9139007	You can't do that on television and Invader Zim.
9139327	9140689	You guys can send a vote.
9140729	9141950	You get to vote for one.
9142290	9145492	Send a private message to Sky in the chatroom with your vote.
9146613	9148995	Some of the ones we missed, you guys, according to the chatroom.
9149436	9151677	Count Duckula, Ren and Stimpy,
9152957	9154038	Um, that's a big one.
9154138	9160803	Actually, I think Vader Zim should come off the list because while it's still, um, it is a cancelled show, they still rerun it.
9161263	9162984	I'm saying no, we already put him there.
9163605	9166206	Um, Amanda's show?
9166667	9167007	No.
9167367	9168648	Clarissa Explains It All.
9168668	9170489	Clarissa Explains It All, thank you.
9170509	9173872	I liked Clarissa Explains It All because the guy who came in through the window.
9173892	9177074	She never taught me about sexuality, she didn't explain it all.
9181557	9182578	I would also say Turkey Television.
9197469	9199331	But nobody remembers that show, not a damn person.
9199631	9201212	Today's special.
9201773	9203334	I remember today's special.
9203655	9205596	Doug, Pinwheels.
9206077	9207078	Doug is now on Disney.
9207098	9207758	I mentioned Pinwheels.
9207818	9210000	It's actually on Disney in the morning now.
9210020	9211221	Dang, that show's been going forever then.
9211762	9213443	Alright, well, dudes, thanks for playing.
9213463	9214905	We'll let you know how it turns out, alright?
9214925	9215825	Yay.
9216126	9218228	Alright, thanks for playing and have a good one, okay?
9218848	9219048	Later.
9222847	9224467	You just wanted to say boobs on our show.
9225088	9226208	Rocko's Modern Life.
9226328	9228349	That's okay, we say boobs all the time.
9228409	9229749	Boobs, boobs, boobs, boobs, boobs, boobs.
9229789	9239132	You know, Rocko's Modern Life, the characters from Rocko is supposed to have like a cameo in the, or not the Rugrats movie, the Spongebob movie, but I don't remember seeing them.
9239372	9242873	Fucking Spongebob Squarepants, but again, that's all.
9242913	9243513	Thank God.
9243533	9244793	That's all Nickelodeon is now.
9245573	9248274	I hate Spongebob.
9248314	9250295	Dude, Spongebob is not that bad.
9251175	9253419	No, technically all that is still on there too.
9254020	9254260	Is it?
9254540	9255522	Yeah, it's still on there.
9255542	9256183	Okay.
9256363	9261170	Because now that one of the guys from it actually is on Saturday Night Live, they're like, oh, we're famous now.
9261751	9261992	Yeah.
9262753	9263834	So, whatever.
9264821	9267102	Legend of the Hidden Temple was freaking awesome and Guts was on my list.
9285974	9290056	But I took it off in favor of whatever the first one was.
9290796	9292397	Well, Guts was a good idea.
9292877	9295318	I'll just remember the referee that they had on the show.
9295358	9297019	We have all these veggie cords.
9297059	9298119	What are we going to do with them?
9298179	9300280	Let's play every game with them.
9300300	9302241	The aggro crag.
9302261	9305323	Let's climb up the big glowing purple hunk of plastic.
9305503	9307363	Uh-oh, I got aggroed by the crag.
9307984	9311445	You lost ten minutes because you didn't hit the little charger thing.
9311665	9312466	You suck.
9312786	9314627	Time to go back to kindergarten.
9315546	9315846	And the NFM?
9332665	9333425	Oh, the Neon FM.
9333445	9334145	We'll get to that, too.
9334185	9334826	I promise we will.
9335186	9335446	All right.
9335786	9336346	We'll get to that.
9336966	9339327	So let's get those votes in real quick because we're going to get to the FUs of the week.
9339387	9344228	Don't send your FUs just yet, though, because we've got to get the votes for listless out of the way first.
9344288	9347129	So we'll be back after this quick break with more Orange Lounge Radio.
9370999	9371980	Thank you for watching!
9397499	9401879	Go on the mic, word up, this groove is set to soon Move you, fuck people now, it's time to
9432902	9433368	and many more.
9466736	9467544	Thanks for watching!
9526761	9529743	Okay, technically this next song is from second mix, but Jamie begged.
9529903	9530263	I cried.
9555006	9558200	Now I realize, it's all the love I'm bringing
9616821	9627026	We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
9627246	9629086	Love by Sonic Dream from Second Mix.
9629126	9630107	Before that, Bakwa.
9631107	9633648	And starting us off, Extreme Wonderland.
9633668	9636370	I heard Miracle last night when I was at Red Lobster.
9640219	9641041	Miracles.
9641122	9643228	Yeah, from Max too.
9643288	9643689	No, Max.
9643769	9644070	Max.
9644632	9647520	Alright, you want to find out tonight's listless winners?
9648854	9649554	We did the votes.
9649634	9650514	Yes, Kay, thanks.
9651075	9651935	This was a toughie.
9651975	9653955	We had a lot of votes kind of spread out tonight.
9654035	9657416	Everybody loves Nickelodeon, so I'm glad we could talk about it here.
9657516	9658676	Nobody loves MTV, though.
9659196	9659637	Yeah, nobody.
9660577	9666138	Seriously, I actually watched a little bit of MTV for the first time in a long time yesterday.
9666178	9670659	There was a marathon of Next, which is some type of speed dating show.
9670739	9671259	It's awful.
9671860	9672520	Yeah, I remember.
9672600	9673520	I've seen that show.
9673900	9677681	What about, they also had a marathon yesterday, I thought, of True Life.
9680278	9683399	I don't watch TV, so I have no idea what the fuck either of you are talking about.
9699086	9702408	Oh my god, no, I'd have to see that, because that would be hilarious.
9702448	9704449	True, they honestly had that, it was great.
9704469	9707210	True Life is actually one of the few decent series they have now, I think.
9707290	9711292	But, like, all these, like, you know what my friends are into, and I don't get this at all.
9711412	9720476	They don't watch the real world, they don't watch Road Rules, but what they do watch is that fucking, like, Inferno show, where it's like real world meets Road Rules on, I don't know, whatever.
9720536	9723018	Isn't, like, MTV All Reality shows nowadays now?
9723658	9724078	Pretty much.
9724739	9725359	It's MTV.
9727967	9737810	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9757373	9758013	Liquid Television.
9758914	9760235	And I remember Pauly Shore.
9760295	9762296	You know that Aeon Flux movie is coming out next year?
9762936	9763536	Or is it this year?
9764097	9764997	I think I'm going to see that.
9765037	9767799	It looks kind of, I don't know.
9768519	9771881	However, there's one show that I do watch sort of.
9772221	9773842	My guilty pleasure on TV is Pimp My Ride.
9775062	9779985	Because I want to take my mom's ice cream truck and see what they can do with that.
9782410	9785011	They love crap like that, you know, where it's just like something weird.
9785991	9794893	You know what my guilty... I'm actually going to go see Aeon Flux, you know, but my guilty pleasure movie of this year, which is an MTV movie actually, is going to be Roll Bounce.
9795653	9796373	The hell's that?
9796533	9804775	Roll Bounce is a movie set in the 70s during the roller disco era, and it's actually... I remember roller disco!
9804795	9805975	Basically, it is...
9807361	9810062	It is, um, You Got Served on Roller Skates.
9810102	9810622	All right, look.
9810642	9812402	I need to see that!
9812482	9814963	Okay, no, my fucking... It's looking awesome, okay?
9815103	9820784	Look, people, we'll do the MTV show they need to bring back at a later date, but we gotta get rid of tonight's list list first.
9820804	9821844	Check out the trailer, though.
9821864	9822924	It's online on Apple.
9823064	9823464	Check it out.
9823944	9824885	All right, let's do this.
9825245	9826945	Uh, top three list list tonight.
9827525	9828745	Nickelodeon show they should bring back.
9828806	9830206	Number third, number three.
9830226	9831426	Number third.
9831546	9832066	Number third.
9832086	9835587	Uh, You Can't Do That on Television in third place tonight.
9836713	9840115	In second place tonight, Invader Zim.
9841136	9841817	Rightfully so.
9842297	9845699	In first place, what are the gamers going to say?
9846640	9847200	What do you think?
9847240	9848081	Nick Arcade.
9848101	9850543	Nick Arcade in first place, you guys.
9852144	9854265	Good job, tonight's list list.
9854646	9856387	I would watch it if they brought any of those shows back.
9856909	9858350	They need to have Nick Classic.
9858851	9859091	Alright.
9859271	9860532	Well, they have gas.
9860692	9864415	Yeah, I have gas too, but you know what?
9864436	9865777	I'm not going to be watching it.
9865937	9868679	They need Nick Classic.
9868979	9871962	Honestly, the old school shows need to just run the reruns.
9872322	9872663	Who cares?
9873143	9876466	Alright, let's get on to tonight's FUs or we're going to run out of time here.
9876506	9878908	So, Jamie, why do we do the FUs of the week every single week?
9879789	9883812	Because I hate everybody and everything and I just need to slip my wrist.
9892980	9898762	I want my god damn car you bitches!
9899762	9901643	Okay, I have been, oh hi ferret.
9904924	9910126	I have been without a car, okay get this, I've been without a car now for a month!
9910886	9911226	A month!
9912127	9913067	A month with no ride!
9921321	9928692	I need a car this week and I need my god damn three thousand dollars check to be here now
9929997	9942603	So, I don't care when the fuck you mailed it, you should have sent that shit Federal Express to my door, hand-delivered by, you know, young boys dressed in, you know, old pageboy livery or something, I don't know.
9943464	9944985	It should have been at my door.
9945525	9947786	It should have been in my hand a week ago.
9947806	9950207	It should have been in my hand three weeks ago.
9950507	9951148	I need a car.
9951748	9952088	That's it.
9954289	9954850	Loki.
9956190	9957011	I only have two.
9958035	9962544	The first one is this fucking headache that's been on my head for two days.
9962985	9969178	I say on my head because it switched from the right side to the left side last night.
9969611	9976034	So now whatever parasite it is in my head is on my left side, and it still hurts, and it's the Sunday headache.
9976314	9977895	And I don't know why I can't get rid of it.
9977935	9982438	Anyways, and the second thing goes to, well I actually have three.
9982578	9987540	So the second thing goes to the servers on Final Fantasy because they're still crashing.
9988040	9993983	And they should have fixed this months ago, and I don't know why they can't seem to fend off a stupid DNS attack.
9994444	9996925	It's just a DNS attack, come on, people, you know, fix it.
9997737	10024712	and the third goes to the phone company for some reason charging me $80 when they should be charging me $40 for the first time thing and they're saying that I'm like there's some non uh some sort of charges that are non you know standard charges or whatever like 32 bucks I'm like what the hell is this I don't have any extra services so I have to call them and find out what that is tomorrow so that's it my turn
10031153	10034213	I'm going to give an F you to missing deadlines at work, because that really sucks.
10034633	10040355	I want to give an F you to earwax, because apparently I had a really bad buildup of earwax in one of my ears.
10040835	10042615	No, look, this is a totally normal thing, okay?
10042635	10043115	Y'all get it.
10043776	10048777	I had a really bad buildup, and I actually lost hearing in my right ear a couple days ago.
10049077	10050277	And I was totally freaked out.
10050357	10056939	I was like, oh my god, I'm going to be deaf, and I do radio as a hobby, I'm going to be screwed for the rest of my life, I'll never be able to play DDR again.
10056959	10058259	That's why I have one of those cool
10059600	10067965	I was trying to clean my ear with a Q-tip, like a normal sanitary person would do.
10068225	10074949	That's actually very bad for you, because what I did is I actually pushed the wax in further with a Q-tip and made myself lose hearing.
10074969	10076409	Yeah, don't push it in, you gotta go around.
10076429	10078991	Well, that's what I was trying to do, but somehow I pushed it in.
10079271	10085895	So anyway, kids, if you have your wax filled up, go to the store and get the liquid that you put in your ear, because that's the only way you're gonna do it.
10086926	10088007	Don't use a Q-tip, I went down the highway.
10088027	10088567	Go swim in a pool.
10089288	10090129	Swim in a pool, folks.
10090449	10090729	Alright.
10092290	10093491	And I guess that's it.
10093651	10097575	So, an FU to $15 copays to get your earwax removed, that's pretty bad.
10098175	10100537	Alright, let's go to Islander.
10103179	10104620	FU to airborne viruses.
10107463	10111526	Why can't more diseases be like, I don't know, HIV?
10113014	10118676	It's like, you know, you know what you have to do to get it, so if you just avoid that, you won't get it?
10119816	10120076	No.
10120476	10124557	The flu has to be something you can just give to someone by talking to them.
10125557	10125858	Damn it.
10128878	10129519	That's pretty much it.
10129759	10130019	Alright.
10130619	10131739	Thank God you can't catch ugly.
10137601	10140381	OMG, it's OMG Tits Boobs.
10142022	10142442	Awesome.
10143857	10145717	He took my suggestion.
10145857	10146578	Is that doobs?
10146738	10147558	Yes, it's doobs.
10147758	10154419	OMG Tits Boobs says, F you to my girlfriend being able to beat me on Paranoia Survivor Max Oni Shuffle.
10155939	10158900	F you to Brazilian people on MMOs again because they suck at English.
10159380	10160480	What a great generalization.
10161420	10164161	And F you to my 13-year-old cousin for living in New York so long.
10164201	10166081	He's like a big drug dealer now and he's 13.
10166441	10169342	Oh, and F you for living in Florida because my house is infested with bugs.
10171300	10176424	LemonLimeJump sent in a late vote for, um... Sorry, I thought that was an FU.
10177825	10180667	DarkTetsuya says, F you to hire next morning.
10181688	10183450	I guess he's going for the AAAs or something.
10185131	10188874	Ron Chan says, F you to my old job for fucking me over, as he said earlier.
10189154	10191916	That's okay, because I'm going to CompUSA, your competition.
10192256	10193938	Who's getting pwned now, bitches?
10194997	10195517	You know what?
10195898	10197659	They're fucking you over, fuck them back.
10197879	10199300	I love it when I get to say pwned.
10200000	10208906	Dark Knight says, my FU goes to work being a bitch and not feeling appreciated when I bust my ass going out of my way to satisfy customers, even though I'm just a cashier.
10210547	10219173	Illusion says, FU to my uncle's wife's gay brother that is covering it up by marrying a woman that is so into herself that she won't need any love for herself's wife's.
10220220	10222041	I need a map to figure that one out.
10222101	10228803	30th birthday party that was full of boring rich people that only played corny songs like, This song is for all the girls, or whatever it was.
10229683	10238706	F you to not being able to go to karaoke because of this party, and F you to the weekend being boring because of nothing to do this weekend, but I did finally get to watch Rocky Horror Picture Show.
10239306	10240246	That coming from Illusion.
10241406	10242127	Congratulations.
10243687	10246768	Ninst says, F you to my computer for acting up lately.
10248124	10256149	Reznor says, a big fuck you to customers that can't keep their kids from putting used condoms in their computer's floppy drive.
10256669	10257710	You've got to be kidding.
10260411	10260872	Wow.
10261812	10263413	I didn't know you could fit that in there.
10263573	10264654	Wowie, wowie, wow.
10264674	10265274	Well, they're kids.
10266615	10267616	What the hell would you think?
10267896	10268256	Hmm.
10269036	10269977	Used condom receptacle.
10269997	10274740	Dude, there's people that think the CD-ROM is a coffee tray, so, or a coffee cup tray thing.
10274760	10275800	I can at least see that.
10276960	10279304	My question is, where do these kids get the used condoms?
10280366	10281087	From their parents?
10281548	10285936	But, you should, like, hide that shit, or, like, better, or something.
10286998	10287900	Here, leave me alone, go play this.
10290647	10292288	Go blow up these balloons.
10293149	10297892	Sugaru-chan says, F you to Ultramix and Ultramix 2 for having such horrible music.
10298272	10299092	I disagree, but whatever.
10299112	10301414	You know, actually, some girl got AIDS from that.
10301494	10301974	Stop it.
10302534	10305636	And for their not having more Konami-Bomani games in the US.
10306357	10309939	Sugaru-chan says, last F you for my boyfriend using me and cosplay.
10312554	10319759	DarkLionXVI says, F you to David Williams for calling my pocket aces with his 6-7 of clubs on the World Series of Poker.
10319819	10320660	No limit tourney.
10321220	10325783	The flop came 8-5-9 of clubs for the straight flush, eliminating me in the process.
10326364	10330446	F you to myself for playing one more lovely another, forgetting to turn off hard mode.
10331027	10331247	Oops.
10332526	10342380	And lastly, Iguana Girl says, F you to bad car batteries and corrosion that causes Jessica to be stuck out in the heat and wind for seven and a half hours.
10343582	10343742	Ouch.
10346704	10347825	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10374925	10377145	They have had commercials!
10377526	10379346	I have seen commercials on VH1!
10379706	10380366	Advertising!
10380586	10381686	Become a Hooter Girl!
10381766	10383127	I was like, it's coming!
10383707	10384347	It's coming!
10384847	10385527	Soon!
10385787	10389308	We are like, what, the last city in the nation to get a Hooters.
10390008	10392508	Seriously, LA has 5 billion.
10392548	10396449	I think Sacramento is the last city in the nation, big city, to get a Hooters.
10397049	10397889	We're finally getting one.
10398089	10400070	We're also getting Logan's Roadhouse, which also makes me happy.
10402352	10408116	Somebody in the chat room is yelling at me because they already signed to our website.
10408256	10409156	I got busted.
10409356	10413359	You know, there's actually someone down the street from where I live who does this for a living.
10414240	10414600	Straight up.
10415040	10416061	Dancing Dan.
10417101	10420063	If he doesn't have a gig going, his sign says, hire me.
10421444	10421864	Wow.
10422305	10425687	And this guy, this dude says, $11.50 an hour is what he makes doing that.
10425707	10425887	Holy.
10426681	10427041	I know.
10427281	10429402	Oh, well, I mean, like, for just doing that?
10430082	10430802	Now I understand.
10430822	10435884	Try to put Nelly on the corner, man, because she's not making that kind of money.
10436124	10438845	You are going to put your fiancé on the corner, have her work the corner.
10439705	10441526	Seriously, that's some good money there.
10441806	10442446	That's awesome.
10442766	10444727	Plus, she's bitching about not having a tan.
10444807	10445307	There you go.
10446347	10447068	It's a twofer.
10450309	10451369	You're a bastard.
10453069	10454150	Who would want to marry you?
10458223	10458463	Neon FM
10487346	10491770	Sounds like a lot of Naoki songs I've heard before, but that's kind of cute that they invoke that.
10491850	10493371	So, what do you guys think, real quickly?
10493952	10495453	Naoki.
10495673	10497454	I don't know what the point of 1981 is.
10497995	10498375	Whatever.
10498455	10499296	Bride and Dream.
10515984	10519370	Dude, it's like an Ayumi Tamasaki techno song.
10520172	10522476	Time to drop some E and go to a rave.
10522656	10526704	I have heard that whole song before, I remember, somewhere, and it's really good.
10526844	10527826	That's kind of hot, I like that.
10527886	10528588	Bring the beat back.
10543117	10544818	Wow, that bitch is off-key.
10545678	10546298	Is it just me?
10546979	10553402	Yeah, well, once she's off-key, and I think for me, for that song to be cool, they need to lose that techno-ish aspect.
10554823	10555203	It's okay.
10555243	10556644	I'm actually liking this so far, though.
10556684	10557284	This isn't bad.
10557304	10557804	I like this.
10557864	10558765	Can you feel the music?
10575097	10576258	All right, that's Can You Feel the Music.
10576298	10576838	I kind of like that.
10577558	10580280	Do you have an artist list up so we can tell you who the artists of these songs are?
10580300	10580860	I have to look.
10580900	10583701	Go to the site so we can get some of that, because I only have the song titles here.
10583762	10584702	You like that one, DarkSakura?
10585502	10586643	Yeah, I do like that one a whole bunch.
10586663	10588004	All right, Complete Shot.
10591426	10592126	Here's the earlier...
10595120	10596161	Oh yeah, we heard this one earlier.
10596261	10596741	That's alright.
10597622	10598863	Wait, what was that song again?
10598923	10599604	Complete Shot.
10599704	10600424	No, the one before that.
10601145	10601945	Can You Feel the Music.
10602066	10603647	Can You Feel the Music.
10604808	10605648	There's a song list on there.
10605668	10606429	Why are you going to that page?
10606789	10608891	Well, I'm going to... This is the same page.
10608931	10613435	I'm just looking to see... Whatever.
10613455	10614075	We've got to get through this.
10614095	10614696	We're running out of show.
10614756	10615136	Control...
10629631	10634012	Wait, this song's familiar.
10634772	10635333	I like that one.
10635353	10635933	That's pretty cool.
10635953	10638774	That's a different drum song, I think.
10639174	10639694	I think it is.
10640054	10640854	Is that the Alien 6?
10641354	10642054	No, no, no.
10642154	10645235	That's... Damn, because I've heard of that.
10645535	10646115	The Nine.
10646696	10650977	It's from... It's a free... Or not a... A different drum song.
10650997	10653778	You can actually get the whole song on Amazon for free.
10654698	10655698	Because I know I've listened to that.
10656298	10656678	The Nine.
10656698	10657018	You're right.
10657058	10657379	That's it.
10658059	10658659	Enough of you.
10661994	10662554	Thomas Howard.
10662714	10664114	Thomas Howard.
10665115	10666475	Yay, a ballad.
10666595	10667755	OLR staff favorite.
10667915	10670456	I can't wait to play this.
10670476	10672356	Alright, let's run through this here.
10672416	10673197	Gotta Kick My Love.
10673237	10673877	Sounds like Togo.
10685169	10685410	Haruharu
10705390	10707091	Hi-G doing that one.
10707712	10716798	Hiro is the guy that does Gotta Kick My Love right now, and you can go to his website, www.hiro777.com.
10717938	10718879	Nation's World.
10719620	10724783	I hate this song.
10726724	10728205	This song came out a long time ago.
10729006	10733569	Again, we're playing clips from new songs on Neon FM, which are available on Neon FM's website, yes?
10733589	10733649	Yes.
10734068	10736849	DJ Potato featuring THL, this is Putter in Reverse
10763038	10763319	What?
10764420	10766441	I feel like I should be waving my hands in a per-per-motion.
10766662	10767222	Seriously.
10767262	10768864	Sexy, sexy, sexy.
10768944	10769905	Rhinestone Cowboy.
10780569	10781710	That's Ricky and Daz.
10781730	10783632	That's actually kind of a commercially known song.
10783652	10785533	Yeah, Ricky and Daz, the Space Cats.
10785553	10792618	You can go to SpaceCats.com Oh, so that's why it sounds like Bus Stop, because those are the singers from Bus Stop.
10793859	10794459	Aha!
10794780	10795380	Gotcha!
10795640	10796181	That's why.
10796241	10798082	You guys know this one if you've ever played Frequency.
10801284	10801705	Yeah.
10802762	10804023	Dude, Freeze Pop rocks.
10804043	10804483	You shut up.
10804503	10805844	That was Science Genius.
10805944	10809226	I like some Freeze Pop, I just didn't care for that Freeze Pop song.
10809966	10815369	DJ Siamie, I don't know, DJ Siamie, Siamie, I think so, with Skyward.
10826456	10827497	Not bad, not bad.
10827897	10829638	Freeze Pop, again, Stakeout.
10841124	10848129	That's the song that almost got retired in the cage match, but Jamie decided in a tie vote its fourth week to go for the other song.
10849510	10852732	Sorry, that much freeze pop every so often makes my head want to go floaty.
10852852	10853572	You'll love this.
10853652	10855193	Super Sprode is another song.
10857635	10858696	I should like Super Sprode.
10859937	10861137	It's in a minor key.
10863919	10866081	DJ Potato with Tune In.
10870816	10872297	This is a theme song also.
10876520	10877801	I don't know for a theme song.
10877821	10878421	That's a little weird.
10878541	10885285	Well, they had a different version of that, or cut of that, but actually it was really good when I saw the preview video.
10886126	10888628	Alien number 613, You Got the City.
10892930	10894371	I'm digging this one.
10894411	10896693	It makes me think of Chemical Love from Bust a Move.
10896873	10897974	I am really digging that.
10899215	10899695	Definitely.
10901404	10903857	And lastly, Zap Remix.
10920487	10921167	Thanks for watching!
10941462	10945525	Final Thought Time Islander, thanks for being here tonight, appreciate it Final Thought
10969666	10974708	Um, final thought, uh, um, why am I blanking out?
10974788	10975088	I don't know.
10975448	10978130	I, final thought, um, drink more orange juice.
10979550	10980951	Loki, your final thought for tonight.
10982491	10988454	You know, I had something, and I can't remember what it was, but, uh, all I'm gonna say is two things.
10988934	10992215	One, go vote for our podcast on Podcast Alley.
10992435	10995877	Go do it now, because honestly, you want to.
10996037	10996717	You know you want to.
10997305	11013129	and also go check out my MySpace page, myspace.com slash LokiFusion and that's where you're going to find when I unveil brand new songs or even upload works in progress.
11013209	11017270	So check out that page, it's got a spiffy little thing you can download.
11018430	11023652	A couple songs, including the Ecstasy remix and the Radical Faith remix, which you might not have heard.
11024632	11029614	It's on there, and also there's a cool little banner that I made, and it's pretty nice.
11029794	11030495	So anyways, check it out.
11031075	11033196	That's myspace.com slash LokiFusion.
11033476	11034516	LokiFusion, all one word.
11034776	11036137	All right, I'll put that in the chat room as well.
11037077	11046080	My final thought is, because I promised somebody I would say it again, Hyperion 7, Murdoch is password God, right?
11046460	11047681	Yes, that's where I play.
11048413	11049514	DarkSakura, your final thought.
11050656	11051817	Reject false spirits.
11055561	11058184	Alright, and final word of the show.
11058244	11060026	You know I gotta give it to the guests when we have one.
11060126	11061788	Islander, one word that sums it all up.
11061828	11062669	See you guys next week.
11062689	11064030	We appreciate you tuning in tonight.
11064351	11066493	You know, one word isn't gonna do it.
11066994	11067614	It has to be two.
11068015	11068936	Ghostbots.
11070413	11073435	And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.
11102518	11103739	Approach, students.
11104499	11107420	Close the circle at the feet of the Master.
11109161	11114844	You have come to me asking that I be your guide along the path of Tai Kwan Leap.
11115825	11122268	But be warned, to learn its ways, you must learn the ways of your own soul.
11123348	11125469	Let us meditate upon this wisdom now.
11126270	11130972	So, Aum.
11132811	11134653	Uh, sir?
11134993	11135453	Sir?
11136014	11137215	Oh, oh, sir?
11137575	11142380	Who disturbs our meditation as a pebble disturbs the stillness of the pond?
11142780	11143060	Me.
11145783	11146664	Ed Gruberman?
11151428	11152769	Ed Gruberman.
11152869	11157013	Yeah, uh, no disrespect or nothing, but like, how long is this gonna take?
11158578	11164663	Taekwon Leap is not a path to a door, but a road leading forever towards the horizon.
11165524	11167506	So like, what, an hour or so?
11170908	11174011	No, no, we have not even begun upon the path.
11174632	11176813	Ed Gruberman, you must learn patience.
11176893	11177974	Yeah, yeah, yeah, patience.
11178014	11178915	How long will that take?
11181517	11182818	Time has no meaning.
11183479	11186161	To a true student, a year is as a day.
11186201	11186602	A year? !
11187392	11189293	I want to beat people up right now.
11189974	11192375	I got the pajamas.
11199240	11200481	Beat people up?
11200581	11204424	Yeah, just show me all those nifty moves so I can start trashing bozos.
11204864	11206105	That's all I came here for.
11206405	11212249	The only use of Taekwondo is self-defense.
11212809	11213850	Do you know who said that?
11214490	11216652	Ki Lo Ni, the great teacher.
11217225	11217545	Yeah?
11217985	11220387	Well, the best defense is a good offense.
11220427	11221407	You know who said that?
11222068	11223528	Mel, the cook on Alice.
11225850	11235054	No, um... Taekwon Lip is the wine of purity, not the vinegar of hostility.
11235755	11237636	Meditate upon this truth with us.
11239697	11239797	Oh...
11240419	11241719	Listen, shrimp.
11241799	11245780	Now, are you going to show me some fancy moves, or am I going to start wiping the walls with you?
11246260	11249001	Ed Gruberman, you failed to grasp Taekwon Leap.
11249381	11250861	Approach me that you might see.
11251301	11252701	All right, finally some action.
11253121	11254421	Observe closely, class.
11255942	11256562	Boot to the head.
11259862	11262323	Ow, you're pulling me in the head!
11263423	11264863	You are lucky, Ed Gruberman.
11265323	11268704	Few novices experience so much of Taekwon Leap so soon.
11268944	11269004	Ow!
11270419	11271460	Now we continue.
11273721	11275962	Hey, hey, I wasn't ready.
11276002	11277642	Come and get me now, shorty, huh?
11277782	11279163	Come on, are you chicken?
11279363	11279943	Boot to the head.
11281384	11283945	Oh, okay, now I'm ready.
11284025	11286046	Okay, now, come on, try it now.
11286226	11286827	Boot to the head.
11288547	11290668	Mind if I just lie down here for a minute?
11293746	11298947	Now, class, we shall return to our... Master, it is wrong to tip the vessel of knowledge, student.
11299087	11303748	Many apologies, master, but I feel Ed Gruberman is not wholly wrong.
11304308	11304968	What do you mean?
11305388	11306928	I want to boot some head, too.
11308248	11310749	Have you learned nothing from the lesson of Ed Gruberman?
11310849	11311529	Yes, master.
11311969	11313209	I have learned two things.
11313809	11317330	First, that anger is a weapon only to one's opponent.
11317390	11317930	Very good.
11318170	11320291	And secondly, get in the first shot.
11320651	11321291	Boot to the head.
11322551	11323011	You missed.
11323951	11324291	Uh, yeah.
11324652	11326913	You two shall be honored to learn a lesson about us.
11326933	11327914	You don't have to, you know.
11328515	11329135	Boot to the head.
11329195	11330736	I gotta be going.
11332318	11335040	Can anyone tell us what lesson has been learned here?
11335440	11336421	Uh, yes, master.
11336721	11338843	Not a single one of us could defeat you.
11338883	11340424	You gain wisdom, child.
11341385	11342445	So we'll have to gang up on you.
11342465	11343166	Get him down!
11343206	11344367	Boot to the head.
11344607	11344787	Ah!
11351096	11357459	And now, class, let us rejoin the mind to the body and gaze into the heart of the candle in meditation.
11362241	11363701	Aum.
11363901	11365002	Very good, class.
11381567	11389942	People talking in movie shows, people smoking in bed People voting Republican, give them a boot to the head
11409389	11417839	Botanics who can't fix a car Politicians who can't think The salesman who won't leave me alone The waiter who forgot my drink
11460911	11464427	Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.
11482383	11484504	God damn, that was a long fortune cookie message.
11484524	11484945	That's alright.
11484985	11488687	I thought I was just putting the song up, but I forgot that I had that as the whole thing.
11488787	11497072	Our chatroom got a kick out of that, so we appreciate anything that can get the chatroom all happy and stuff, because the chatroom is really what keeps us going with this show.
11497092	11498273	The chatroom needs happy pants.
11498553	11499114	Kisses!
11499554	11502516	Alright, thanks you guys so much for tuning in and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

11503336	11504677	I just broke my damn headphones.
11504757	11505638	That's really great.
11506619	11507259	Son of a bitch.
11507860	11508800	All right.
