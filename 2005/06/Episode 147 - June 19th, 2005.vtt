I'm badly animated today.

04:58.980 --> 04:59.980
You're badly drawn today?

04:59.980 --> 05:01.520
Yeah, I'm badly drawn.

05:01.520 --> 05:02.520
You were just drawn that way?

05:02.520 --> 05:03.520
Today I was.

05:03.520 --> 05:04.520
Oh, sorry to hear that.

05:04.520 --> 05:09.240
I love the real me at home because she's currently packing up her entire life to the booties

05:09.240 --> 05:10.240
of Citrus Heights.

05:10.240 --> 05:11.240
Oh, okay.

05:11.240 --> 05:12.240
All right.

05:12.240 --> 05:17.520
I've got a house, I'm moving into a house for renting, therefore I have no life for

05:17.520 --> 05:18.520
two weeks.

05:18.520 --> 05:19.520
Fun!

05:19.520 --> 05:20.520
Exactly.

05:20.520 --> 05:21.520
I know what that's like.

05:21.520 --> 05:22.520
Kinda.

05:22.520 --> 05:23.520
Sorta.

05:23.520 --> 05:25.520
Uh, just recently, as we moved in the new studio.

05:25.520 --> 05:26.520
Anyway.

05:26.520 --> 05:29.520
Also joining us, the recently moved Loki!

05:29.520 --> 05:30.520
Hi.

05:30.520 --> 05:32.520
I just moved.

05:32.520 --> 05:33.520
Yes.

05:33.520 --> 05:34.520
Like, to the side.

05:34.520 --> 05:36.520
You moved from the living room to the studio.

05:36.520 --> 05:37.520
It was very nice.

05:37.520 --> 05:38.520
Yeah.

05:38.520 --> 05:40.520
Unfortunately I didn't move to the pizza hut to get myself dinner.

05:40.520 --> 05:42.520
I knew something was missing.

05:42.520 --> 05:43.520
I forgot.

05:43.520 --> 05:44.520
So.

05:44.520 --> 05:45.520
I'm hungry now.

05:45.520 --> 05:46.520
How could you-

05:46.520 --> 05:47.520
I have a salad.

05:47.520 --> 05:48.520
How could you-

05:48.520 --> 05:49.520
Uh, no I don't eat salad.

05:49.520 --> 05:52.020
I'm a meat-a-terian, okay? I don't touch that-

05:52.020 --> 05:53.520
Her salad has bacon bits.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.020
It has bacon and chicken in it.

05:55.020 --> 05:57.020
Yeah, but the bacon bits aren't real.

05:57.020 --> 05:59.020
They aren't real bacon.

05:59.020 --> 06:01.020
Where'd you get that from, McDonald's?

06:01.020 --> 06:03.020
Nothing's real there.

06:03.020 --> 06:05.520
Dan says that salad is what food eats.

06:07.520 --> 06:11.520
Exactly. You know, there's supposed to be one more step before I eat that stuff.

06:11.520 --> 06:15.020
I'm eating this because my doctor told me to.

06:16.020 --> 06:18.520
My doctor could tell me to eat salad all he wants,

06:18.520 --> 06:27.520
Yeah, but I don't want to be one of those 300-pound women that walk around in a muumuu scratching their ass in the middle of Walmart with five screaming children.

06:27.520 --> 06:29.520
Dude, I saw that the other day. Sick!

06:29.520 --> 06:30.840
exactly

06:30.840 --> 06:36.480

06:39.240 --> 06:42.040

06:42.040 --> 06:48.040

traumatized

07:01.460 --> 07:06.260
with the with the world we can ask him about it but they might work a moment ago

07:06.260 --> 07:08.700
it's critical

07:08.700 --> 07:09.980
anyway

07:09.980 --> 07:11.780
moving on special death

07:11.780 --> 07:15.420
hello to uh... i'd never know what he wants to be called the back here this

07:15.420 --> 07:18.740
week secret because i'm by whatever

07:18.740 --> 07:19.540
how you doing

07:19.540 --> 07:23.860
good playing mario dia so can you tell us anything new about the game here

07:23.860 --> 07:29.220
habeas o'clock is an ultra moderate banks we are going to go to that night

07:29.220 --> 07:30.160
who

07:30.160 --> 07:34.180
uh... he told us last week that would have been an exclusive but india

07:34.180 --> 07:37.220
activities i can tell you a last week

07:37.220 --> 07:41.040
as though it this week okay i missed a little bit behind the new evening spray

07:41.040 --> 07:45.260
told us the spray thing yeah well i was going to tell it to

07:45.260 --> 07:49.840
your work

07:49.840 --> 07:53.460
secret may say something tonight but i don't know he looks too enthralled with

07:53.460 --> 07:57.460
whatever he's playing on his brand new Blue DS. What are you playing?

07:57.460 --> 08:00.460
I'm playing the crappy, or actually the fun minigames of Mario.

08:00.460 --> 08:05.900
Secret, by the way, for those of our folks who are new listeners to the show, he actually

08:05.900 --> 08:12.900
works at the big K, Konami, and therefore, on one hand it's really great to have him

08:12.900 --> 08:16.460
on the show, because hey, who better to talk about DDR than somebody who works on DDR,

08:16.460 --> 08:21.620
but on the other hand, he can't tell a shit about DDR, because if they find out, you know,

08:21.620 --> 08:24.340
You know, with the feds listening to this show and all, they'll find him and they'll

08:24.340 --> 08:25.340
beat him up.

08:25.340 --> 08:26.340
Right?

08:26.340 --> 08:27.700
Is that what happens?

08:27.700 --> 08:28.700
Something like that.

08:28.700 --> 08:29.700
What happens to people that violate NDAs?

08:29.700 --> 08:31.660
Or would that be a violation of the NDAs?

08:31.660 --> 08:35.420
They in turn become violated.

08:35.420 --> 08:38.620
It's something like that, unfortunately.

08:38.620 --> 08:39.620
That sounds kind of exciting.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.940
They're beaten by Simon Belmont's whip.

08:41.940 --> 08:42.940
Alright.

08:42.940 --> 08:43.940
Anyway, let's get to a break.

08:43.940 --> 08:47.940
We will go to a break and come back with a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your

08:47.940 --> 08:51.140
Day, the Azoic song we'll play for you guys tonight.

08:51.140 --> 08:56.420
as well as whatever else tickles our fancy. Oh, how about this?

08:56.420 --> 08:57.420
Seegerd, now this is...

08:57.420 --> 09:01.560
I always thought this was funny because you work at Konami yet you're a huge Pump It Up fan.

09:01.560 --> 09:05.940
Let's not talk about that. Oh, we're talking about it after this. And this break

09:05.940 --> 09:12.940
Some old school DDR songs we haven't played in a while. We'll be back after this.

09:35.940 --> 09:40.940
Feel the swim you hear the sound of your master on the run

09:41.940 --> 09:47.940
You feel the sense to be the one to come on and join the journey

09:48.940 --> 09:51.940
This is the journey into the night

09:51.940 --> 09:54.940
As long as you start learning

09:54.940 --> 09:57.940
Race is on the run

09:59.940 --> 10:00.940
Are you ready?

10:01.940 --> 10:02.940
Ready for the race

10:02.940 --> 10:04.460
Are you ready?

10:06.180 --> 10:07.780
Are you ready?

10:08.300 --> 10:09.740
I'm ready for the rakes

10:09.740 --> 10:11.740
Are you ready?

10:16.560 --> 10:18.220
Are you ready?

10:23.180 --> 10:24.260
Are you ready?

10:26.360 --> 10:28.600
Are you ready?

10:28.600 --> 10:29.800
I'm ready for the rakes

10:29.800 --> 10:31.800
Are you ready?

10:33.160 --> 10:35.160
Are you ready?

10:35.160 --> 10:36.440
Ready for the race

10:36.440 --> 10:38.440
Are you ready?

10:38.440 --> 10:40.440
Yeah

10:50.920 --> 10:52.920
A place

10:52.920 --> 10:54.920
Where nobody dared to go

10:56.760 --> 10:58.760
The love that we came to know

10:58.760 --> 11:04.760
They call me Salladhu

11:04.760 --> 11:10.760
And Lord, open your eyes and see

11:10.760 --> 11:13.760
What we have made is real

11:13.760 --> 11:20.760
We are Salladhu

11:20.760 --> 11:25.760
I've never loved a day that I've never been here with me

11:25.760 --> 11:27.760
It's Saturday

11:29.760 --> 11:31.760
Saturday

11:33.760 --> 11:35.760
Saturday

11:37.760 --> 11:40.760
It's Saturday

11:41.760 --> 11:45.760
Now that I'm here, now that you're near

11:45.760 --> 12:01.760
It's love, love, love, love, love of you

12:15.760 --> 12:30.760
You say that love is not a possession You say that love needs fantasy You say we must give this devotion But you don't say that you love me

12:30.760 --> 12:44.760
Sometimes I wonder what I'm doing Sometimes I'm cold and serious But when you touch my body and close your eyes My little baby I don't realize

12:44.760 --> 12:49.340
If you can say goodbye, baby tell me why

12:49.560 --> 12:52.560
You don't want to love me just like I do

12:52.560 --> 12:57.380
You can say goodbye, tell me what I got to do

12:59.460 --> 13:03.740
If you can say goodbye, baby tell me why

13:04.120 --> 13:06.960
You don't want to love me just like I do

13:06.960 --> 13:11.960
You can't say goodbye, tell me what I've got to do

14:06.960 --> 14:21.960
And now you're going to blow off the lamp now.

14:21.960 --> 14:34.960
Give it the reading on the 1202 program alarm.

14:34.960 --> 14:56.960
🎵

14:56.960 --> 14:58.960
🎵 Give me the enemy 🎵

14:58.960 --> 15:03.760
🎵

15:03.760 --> 15:28.400
After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move marathon.

15:28.400 --> 15:30.760
Nooooooo!

15:30.760 --> 15:31.760
Just kidding.

15:31.760 --> 15:34.040
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

15:34.040 --> 15:37.000
Thank you guys for tuning in tonight and listening to us.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.320
In that break, you heard Ecstasy from Fifth Mix.

15:39.320 --> 15:41.560
Before that, from Third Mix, see if you can say goodbye by

15:41.560 --> 15:42.640
the Cape Project.

15:42.640 --> 15:45.680
And before that, the Olivia Project with Xanadu.

15:45.680 --> 15:47.520
I didn't realize I kind of put him that way.

15:47.520 --> 15:48.160
But that's all right.

15:48.160 --> 15:49.760
And then starting that set off, a little bit of the

15:49.760 --> 15:52.760
Captain Jack with the race, also from Third Mix.

15:52.760 --> 15:54.200
So a lot of Third Mix on that break.

15:54.200 --> 15:55.520
But hey, that's all right.

15:55.520 --> 15:56.360
Third Mix rocked.

15:56.360 --> 15:58.720
I mean, Third Mix was kind of the piece of the

15:58.720 --> 15:59.720
Third Mix rocked.

15:59.720 --> 16:03.440
I mean, Third Mix, Third Mix was kind of the peak of DDR in many ways.

16:03.440 --> 16:07.360
At least a lot of folks that talk about the Japanese history of the game say it really

16:07.360 --> 16:11.440
peaked with Third Mix, and I don't know, song list wise, I think Third Mix is one of the

16:11.440 --> 16:12.440
best.

16:12.440 --> 16:13.440
It really is.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.080
I'm thinking it's all about Fourth Plus.

16:15.080 --> 16:16.400
Fourth Plus was pretty rad.

16:16.400 --> 16:19.720
I mean, I think that would be like, kind of like the peak, but everybody has their own

16:19.720 --> 16:20.720
argument.

16:20.720 --> 16:23.980
Then there's people that say, no, no, no, Extreme's got the bet, no, no, no, no, second

16:23.980 --> 16:26.040
mix for life, whatever.

16:26.040 --> 16:27.040
Step Battle.

16:27.040 --> 16:28.040
Hey, it's all about Step Battle, okay?

16:28.040 --> 16:33.040
I miss Step Battle, but I can play it at home on my Dreamcast.

16:33.040 --> 16:36.040
Seegard, tell them to put Step Battle back in DDR.

16:36.040 --> 16:38.040
Can you do that? I'll get right on that.

16:38.040 --> 16:41.040
Because I know you actually write the games from scratch yourself.

16:41.040 --> 16:45.040
With a pencil and paper.

16:45.040 --> 16:50.040
And I put it on the sheet and kind of scroll it down.

16:50.040 --> 16:52.040
That's real hand coding there.

16:52.040 --> 16:55.040
Writing down the code and feeding it into a machine.

16:55.040 --> 16:56.040
There you go.

16:56.040 --> 17:00.480
And number two pencil on Scantron.

17:00.480 --> 17:04.120
Is that how you guys do your dance steps on Scantron?

17:04.120 --> 17:09.600
Yeah, but we actually use a blue ink pen instead of number two.

17:09.600 --> 17:10.600
Do you really?

17:10.600 --> 17:11.600
No, you don't.

17:11.600 --> 17:12.600
Do you?

17:12.600 --> 17:13.600
No, we don't.

17:13.600 --> 17:14.600
Oh, okay.

17:14.600 --> 17:18.680
I was going to say, wait a minute, no you don't.

17:18.680 --> 17:21.400
Stop sounding serious during segments like that.

17:21.400 --> 17:22.400
Fine.

17:22.400 --> 17:23.400
All right.

17:23.400 --> 17:24.400
All right.

17:24.400 --> 17:25.400
Anyway.

17:25.400 --> 17:29.520
with another edition of Orange Lounge Radio Live. You know I noticed that we

17:29.520 --> 17:33.080
kind of had a hit listeners lately I don't know if it's maybe it's summertime

17:33.080 --> 17:36.440
so some of the folks that were listening to us in college dorms just decided to

17:36.440 --> 17:40.720
say see ya and aren't gonna listen to the show anymore but I noticed there's

17:40.720 --> 17:43.440
been quite a bit of a drop in listeners let me put it perspective for you guys

17:43.440 --> 17:48.880
about two months ago at this time we were at our station as a whole was at

17:48.880 --> 17:54.720
3900 listening hours as we say so that means you know the 3900 people listen

17:54.720 --> 17:58.080
for one hour each or some people listen more or less you know it evens out to

17:58.080 --> 18:02.760
that right now we're looking at 2,700 listening hours we've taken a hit of

18:02.760 --> 18:06.760
almost a third of our listeners and I'm trying to think of why that is if it's

18:06.760 --> 18:11.760
because just summertime blahs or the fact that we had that life you see five

18:11.760 --> 18:16.280
award thing earlier or if you just don't love us anymore

18:16.280 --> 18:21.120
that's it we need to start selling off Loki stuff that's a good idea

18:21.120 --> 18:25.800
put it on eBay. No I think actually maybe what part of it is is that you know we

18:25.800 --> 18:28.840
had a bunch of weeknight shows now we only have one. We can sell Loki as a

18:28.840 --> 18:34.240
virtual boyfriend on eBay. Nellie might have issues with that, his fiance. But

18:34.240 --> 18:43.240
it's virtual. Like the like the Chi that was on eBay. I don't know. So I

18:43.240 --> 18:45.920
don't know I think part of that might be because we don't have as much weeknight

18:45.920 --> 18:48.960
programming of course the lovely dark Sakura of being the trooper she is still

18:48.960 --> 18:52.400
has her Tuesday night show and I hope you all are listening because it's very nice.

18:52.400 --> 18:53.400
It's a nice program.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.480
I have a few people.

18:55.480 --> 18:58.800
It's something the whole family can sit around the computer and really enjoy.

18:58.800 --> 19:05.200
Sure if they want to hear, hi dad, I'm in jail, I like it here.

19:05.200 --> 19:07.800
Yeah so, but no, we're going to remedy that.

19:07.800 --> 19:10.720
We have a brand new show.

19:10.720 --> 19:12.780
I don't know how much I want to say about it yet because it's not done, but we're going

19:12.780 --> 19:14.800
to have a lunchtime show.

19:14.800 --> 19:18.280
So we're going to have programming in the daytime, which should be very interesting.

19:18.280 --> 19:23.120
And it's gonna be something that plays for like a half hour every Monday through Friday.

19:23.120 --> 19:26.120
And what it is, I can't tell you yet, but you'll find out very soon.

19:26.120 --> 19:27.120
It's gonna be very cool.

19:27.120 --> 19:31.440
I love, I love the idea, partially because I've worked so hard on it, but I think it

19:31.440 --> 19:32.440
really is a good idea.

19:32.440 --> 19:33.440
So, you'll have that.

19:33.440 --> 19:38.020
And of course, also we had some posts on the forums this week on the OrangeLaunchRadio.com

19:38.020 --> 19:39.160
site on the forums.

19:39.160 --> 19:42.440
Some folks wanted to know, what happened outside the box?

19:42.440 --> 19:48.520
Unfortunately, due to real life and people having jobs, especially at employers that

19:48.520 --> 19:52.700
can't seem to give them regular schedules, et cetera, et cetera, we kind of had to put

19:52.700 --> 19:57.200
outside the box on the back burner for a long, long time.

19:57.200 --> 20:00.760
So pretty much for the foreseeable future until stuff changes.

20:00.760 --> 20:06.680
So I'm working on a new show that will hopefully debut soon on Wednesdays.

20:06.680 --> 20:07.680
And I don't know when that will be.

20:07.680 --> 20:09.420
It will be this week or next week.

20:09.420 --> 20:12.560
So stay tuned to the website for more information on that, kids.

20:12.560 --> 20:13.560
It just depends.

20:13.560 --> 20:14.560
This is going to be a crazy week this week.

20:14.560 --> 20:15.560
You know, my birthday is next Sunday.

20:15.560 --> 20:16.560
You're going to be old.

20:16.560 --> 20:21.480
What are you going to buy me?

20:21.480 --> 20:23.280
A ticket to help me move?

20:23.280 --> 20:25.280
Wait, that's right.

20:25.280 --> 20:26.280
You're going to be driving the truck.

20:26.280 --> 20:27.680
You're going to be moving next Sunday.

20:27.680 --> 20:28.680
Oh, God.

20:28.680 --> 20:29.680
We'll let you drive the U-Haul.

20:29.680 --> 20:30.680
You do not want me driving the U-Haul.

20:30.680 --> 20:32.280
That is some scary shit right there.

20:32.280 --> 20:34.300
I cannot drive U-Hauls.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.300
So you don't want me doing that.

20:36.300 --> 20:41.480
But actually next Sunday, June the 26th, is my actual birthday birthday.

20:41.480 --> 20:46.660
And because Dark Soccer is moving, and because I have my birthday, we are not going to have

20:46.660 --> 20:47.660
a live show that night.

20:47.660 --> 20:48.660
I don't think.

20:48.660 --> 20:49.660
No!

20:49.660 --> 20:50.660
No live show that night.

20:50.660 --> 20:52.700
But we will have something else in our place.

20:52.700 --> 20:59.080
And then, but in two weeks, when we come back July 3rd, huge show because it's our three

20:59.080 --> 21:01.460
year anniversary, if you can believe it.

21:01.460 --> 21:03.960
Three years of doing this crap.

21:03.960 --> 21:10.160
Three years, three studios, three hosts, three migraines every week.

21:10.160 --> 21:11.760
All kinds of aches and pains.

21:11.760 --> 21:13.960
Yes, so we've got that to look forward to.

21:13.960 --> 21:15.560
Torture, torture.

21:15.560 --> 21:16.560
Yep.

21:16.560 --> 21:22.160
All right, so that'll be coming on July 3rd, of all things, so that's like, you know, July

21:22.160 --> 21:24.440
3rd, it's three years, dah, dah, dah.

21:24.440 --> 21:26.840
We'll try to get some fun guests lined up for that show, too.

21:26.840 --> 21:28.080
I think that would be fun.

21:28.080 --> 21:30.200
We should get some guests here that we haven't had for a while.

21:30.200 --> 21:31.440
Maybe we can get Mr. Spanky.

21:31.440 --> 21:32.440
I don't know.

21:32.440 --> 21:33.440
We'll see.

21:33.440 --> 21:38.720
Anyway, enough of me blabbing, let's talk about our weeks and our days, and what's going

21:38.720 --> 21:45.920
on in the wonderful life of yourself, starting off with the one and only, Dark Sakura.

21:45.920 --> 21:56.720
My week has been just work and moving, and lots and lots of pain, not the band, but they're

21:56.720 --> 22:04.680
But I've been having a flare-up from my car accident.

22:04.680 --> 22:09.400
I am having some pretty bad muscle spasms around my right hip, so I scheduled myself

22:09.400 --> 22:14.980
an appointment to see the doctor, who gave me more lovely Vicodin, a new muscle relaxer

22:14.980 --> 22:21.960
called Robaxin, I think is what it's called, something like that, and more ibuprofen, lots

22:21.960 --> 22:27.400
and lots of lovely refills of everything, and then also told me that the reason why

22:27.400 --> 22:34.400
I'm having other pain is because my diet is, uh, hurting my digestion. So I get to completely

22:34.960 --> 22:41.960
change how I'm eating, which is a lot of fun. So, yeah, salad. Um, other than that, I've

22:44.160 --> 22:50.060
been doing nothing but moving. I haven't played any games, really, except for, like, a couple

22:50.060 --> 22:54.020
the games on the Gorillaz site before I found out that we're actually moving next weekend

22:54.020 --> 22:56.820
and not a weekend after. Fun.

22:56.820 --> 23:07.400
How exactly do you take news like that? With a WTFucking F? That's just not like a what

23:07.400 --> 23:12.880
the fuck, it's what the fucking fuck. To put it in perspective, you've got what

23:12.880 --> 23:17.300
the fuck and then what the fucking fuck. But I did get through a lot of stuff yesterday

23:17.300 --> 23:29.000
and today. I also got Tanda to take me to Outback. Mmm ribs. But I found a bunch of

23:29.000 --> 23:33.480
stuff I bought from Alabama including a whole bunch of Superman comics and like

23:33.480 --> 23:39.120
New Mutants all the stuff I was into. I found one of my old RPG journals from

23:39.120 --> 23:44.080
when I played D&D. It was great. Found old character sheets, lots of old nerdy crap.

23:44.080 --> 23:51.080
I found my e20s. Oh, I kept all those together. I know where my dice are. No, no, we ain't

23:51.840 --> 23:58.840
having that. You're a total geek, I love it. I also did find my sketchbook from 1996. I

24:03.160 --> 24:09.560
want to take you back, take you back. Okay. Sorry. That was when I was living in the college

24:09.560 --> 24:15.440
dorms so I'll uh I maybe I'll scan a couple and put them up I also found a

24:15.440 --> 24:22.920
picture of from my first anime expo when I had long hair and that was scary so

24:22.920 --> 24:28.600
maybe those will find their way onto the internet because actually I look a lot

24:28.600 --> 24:33.720
better now than I did then because my first year here I put on like 10 pounds

24:33.720 --> 24:40.400
right away. California will do that to you. Either that or making anorexic. See the one

24:40.400 --> 24:48.400
extreme or the other. Yeah, but that's it for me. Other than I hate dust! Alright, moving

24:48.400 --> 24:55.320
on. Loki! Hey, how was your week? How was your day? Huh? Oh. Yeah, we do a show here,

24:55.320 --> 25:16.320
That's right. Um, well let's see what I do this week. Um, well finally, my purchase of, um, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas has finished, so I was able to play my game, legally. And, um, so, it was quite interesting because I was trying out every single mod.

25:16.320 --> 25:20.320
Did the credit card get held up? What exactly slowed this down?

25:20.320 --> 25:26.240
You have to understand, you see, that, you know, when you're shipping stuff, sometimes,

25:26.240 --> 25:30.120
you know, the truck breaks down or whatnot.

25:30.120 --> 25:31.120
Right.

25:31.120 --> 25:32.120
But over the internet sometimes...

25:32.120 --> 25:34.720
Or when you're in a queue.

25:34.720 --> 25:35.720
I know, I know.

25:35.720 --> 25:36.720
They just...

25:36.720 --> 25:40.200
For some reason, you know, the last bit of the game just, you know, wouldn't ship or

25:40.200 --> 25:44.280
wasn't ready to ship right away for like about a week, you know, I guess as a manual or a

25:44.280 --> 25:45.820
sticker or something.

25:45.820 --> 25:50.240
So I had to wait for a while for it to get done shipping and then I was ready to go play

25:50.240 --> 25:55.880
my brand new game and so anyways the graphics are awesome and I got to actually try out

25:55.880 --> 26:01.840
some of the mods in it so it was the first thing I did I modded the trash master to be

26:01.840 --> 26:08.660
super fast and handle like crazy so that was fun and then for some reason I did this code

26:08.660 --> 26:14.400
where it says become a slut magnet and so I put it in and for some reason I was in the

26:14.400 --> 26:20.040
the GIMP outfit with the dildo and my army of sluts following me, so that was interesting.

26:20.040 --> 26:25.040
And then, um, uh, what else? Remind me to save that clip for the next intro.

26:25.040 --> 26:37.040
Uh, nice. Thank you. You're welcome. Appreciate it. Anyway, I want that, I want that on, like,

26:37.040 --> 26:40.800
one button demand, where I can push a button and I can hear Loki talking about it. Hey,

26:40.800 --> 26:45.060
This isn't the first time that a clip of me talking about Grand Theft Auto has been used

26:45.060 --> 26:46.060
in one of our intros.

26:46.060 --> 26:47.420
That's very true.

26:47.420 --> 26:53.220
Anyways, um, so, after playing around with the game some, um, what was it, actually the

26:53.220 --> 26:57.500
only thing that pissed me off about the game is the controls in it because you have to

26:57.500 --> 27:01.580
kind of use the mouse and keyboard and I hate that because I don't play first person shooters

27:01.580 --> 27:07.900
so I don't like the mouse keyboard thing, I like, you know, just one thing and be done

27:07.900 --> 27:13.460
with it but no whatever I'll figure a way around that then other than that

27:13.460 --> 27:21.300
we're just scoping out locations for the wedding I think we found one and pretty

27:21.300 --> 27:25.380
much that's it I got I found I got spending our thousand dollars for even

27:25.380 --> 27:31.180
more rings this okay the woman is getting three goddamn rings okay she's

27:31.180 --> 27:35.120
getting she's getting ring number one which is the current ring now that she

27:35.120 --> 27:39.200
picked out and guess what? You can't make a wedding band for it. It would have to be

27:39.200 --> 27:45.080
custom made. So she gets engagement ring number two. Make her pawn it. She won't. She has

27:45.080 --> 27:50.480
sentimental attachments. Anyways, so she gets. I have sentimental attachments for my money.

27:50.480 --> 27:56.720
She gets engagement ring number two, okay, and then wedding band. And so engagement ring

27:56.720 --> 28:01.980
number two is now being referred to as the bling ring. So she's getting the bling ring

28:01.980 --> 28:04.860
and then she has the ring engagement ring and then her wedding band.

28:04.860 --> 28:05.860
And how many rings do you get?

28:05.860 --> 28:07.540
I get one.

28:07.540 --> 28:08.540
One student ring.

28:08.540 --> 28:09.540
You know what?

28:09.540 --> 28:10.540
She's paying for that ring.

28:10.540 --> 28:11.540
Oh, that's nice.

28:11.540 --> 28:12.540
Okay.

28:12.540 --> 28:14.140
But I have to pay for the other three, okay?

28:14.140 --> 28:15.140
You know what?

28:15.140 --> 28:19.500
I think this whole wedding ring business is retarded, because the only reason that...

28:19.500 --> 28:24.940
See, Dan and I are having one each, and we're having them custom made to match.

28:24.940 --> 28:27.420
Together the price is $650.

28:27.420 --> 28:29.020
Damn straight, that's what I'm saying, but...

28:29.020 --> 28:31.860
I want it made out of titanium.

28:31.860 --> 28:36.020
uh... mine was going to be made out of tan but it's too dark so here's what i want for

28:36.020 --> 28:39.540
my wedding instead of the rings cause rings sit on my finger get dusty i have to get them

28:39.540 --> 28:42.540
cleaned i want wedding sex that's what i want

28:42.540 --> 28:47.340
well i'm getting that too but you know i mean you know i'd get that without a wedding

28:47.340 --> 28:52.120
see the ring the ring is made to you know so when it's i guess

28:52.120 --> 28:54.980
i guess you'd call it like uh...

28:54.980 --> 28:58.260
you know uh... it's the collar of bondage

28:58.260 --> 28:59.260
I guess.

28:59.260 --> 29:05.780
It's a chick magnet is what it is, because you know women love married men.

29:05.780 --> 29:09.180
You know how when you take magnets and you put the negative against the negative and

29:09.180 --> 29:13.020
they won't stick together for any reason, in fact, they push each other away with great

29:13.020 --> 29:14.280
force.

29:14.280 --> 29:17.300
That's what the wedding ring does in the chick magnet sense.

29:17.300 --> 29:25.180
No, I think you misinformed, but anyways, sorry, I don't understand your hetero-culture.

29:25.180 --> 29:30.580
I don't understand women either, so, you know, we're pretty even on it.

29:30.580 --> 29:34.980
You know what, I don't understand other women myself, because I think that this whole...

29:34.980 --> 29:36.620
I think the whole wedding business is retarded.

29:36.620 --> 29:37.620
Damn straight!

29:37.620 --> 29:40.140
Why the hell do we have to spend so much money after one fucking day?

29:40.140 --> 29:43.820
I'm getting married in the backyard, and the ceremony isn't going to be longer than five

29:43.820 --> 29:49.180
minutes, and then I'm going to have a party and get fucking drunk!

29:49.180 --> 29:53.280
I just want to point out, Orange Lounge Radio is here bridging the gap between straight

29:53.280 --> 29:58.120
men and gay men, because we can at least agree on one thing.

29:58.120 --> 29:59.120
Women are crazy.

29:59.120 --> 30:03.400
Damn straight, and I can say this because I'm certifiably nuts.

30:03.400 --> 30:07.040
Anyways, so yeah, we've already set a date.

30:07.040 --> 30:10.100
It is on a Sunday, but it is next year.

30:10.100 --> 30:15.640
And yeah, and I won't be going to E3 next year, unfortunately, because that falls the

30:15.640 --> 30:19.760
week after the wedding, which that won't be good.

30:19.760 --> 30:22.560
Why do you think I rescheduled mine away from April?

30:22.560 --> 30:24.040
Oh, I'm doing mine in three months.

30:24.040 --> 30:26.160
Fire!

30:26.160 --> 30:27.200
I don't care.

30:27.200 --> 30:30.200
I mean, ironically enough, they'd probably be paying my way.

30:30.200 --> 30:31.000
Make her come with.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.400
We'll introduce her to celebrities.

30:32.400 --> 30:36.440
In a relationship, there must always be compromise, not,

30:36.440 --> 30:39.000
you know, OK, whatever you say.

30:39.000 --> 30:43.000
Yeah, but I don't think honeymoon over, uh,

30:43.000 --> 30:45.240
I don't think I'm going to win that, you know?

30:45.240 --> 30:45.840
All right.

30:45.840 --> 30:48.560
But anyways, so yeah, yeah.

30:48.560 --> 30:51.240
But this will be the night she's listening,

30:51.240 --> 30:53.540
and your ass is dead when you get home.

30:53.540 --> 30:54.540
She's not listening.

30:54.540 --> 30:56.460
She doesn't even know how to listen to this show.

30:56.460 --> 30:58.460
All right.

30:58.460 --> 31:04.660
I started planning a wedding, an actual wedding.

31:04.660 --> 31:06.660
I went on one of those retarded websites

31:06.660 --> 31:08.460
that gives you a budget.

31:08.460 --> 31:12.940
And I saw all this paying for this crap and this crap and this.

31:12.940 --> 31:14.620
A nude mariachi band?

31:14.620 --> 31:15.220
No.

31:15.220 --> 31:20.620
And I was like, they started off the budget at like $7,000.

31:20.620 --> 31:24.620
And I'm like, fuck a bunch of that! That's, you know, like, all my savings right now!

31:24.620 --> 31:27.620
I'd be lucky if ours was $7,000.

31:27.620 --> 31:32.620
So basically, ours is probably- we're probably gonna get out of my wedding for under $1,000.

31:32.620 --> 31:34.620
Under $1,000.

31:34.620 --> 31:40.620
And then probably go spend another $1,000 when we have our two days at Disneyland honeymoon.

31:40.620 --> 31:43.620
And then come back home and go to work.

31:43.620 --> 31:47.620
You know, we've been together for seven years already. We don't need all this bullshit.

31:47.620 --> 31:51.620
Now I'm wondering since gays can't technically get married, can we get some kind of discount?

31:51.620 --> 31:58.620
That's what I'm wondering. Since we get discount weddings, do we get discounts on the costs?

31:58.620 --> 31:59.620
Just curious.

31:59.620 --> 32:03.620
No, that's all though for a gay wedding. They had this on...

32:03.620 --> 32:05.620
Oh God, I don't even remember which show it was.

32:05.620 --> 32:07.620
Probably something on Bravo, probably.

32:07.620 --> 32:27.620
Well, one of my friends was telling me about some other friends of hers who actually had their last names combined into one new last name.

32:27.620 --> 32:34.580
One of my friends was telling me about some other friends of hers who actually had their

32:34.580 --> 32:38.900
last names combined into one new last name effective when they were married.

32:38.900 --> 32:39.900
I've heard of that kind of stuff.

32:39.900 --> 32:42.620
I'm going to have a fucked up last name.

32:42.620 --> 32:43.620
I just want the tax breaks.

32:43.620 --> 32:46.420
I'm going to have a fucked up Dutch last name.

32:46.420 --> 32:49.940
I have no Dutch blood in me.

32:49.940 --> 32:57.100
Wait a minute, now without giving away the soon to be Mister's last name, does it start

32:57.100 --> 33:01.660
with the same three letters that my last name does? No. My real one? No. Oh, I thought it

33:01.660 --> 33:06.660
did. Because that would have been funny if we were both... I know, if you want some Dutch

33:06.660 --> 33:13.660
blood in your system, we can go find a Dutch virgin that you can convert over to a man.

33:14.060 --> 33:21.060
I'm half Dutch, don't do that. I'm not against anyone Dutch, mind you, because there's you

33:21.060 --> 33:25.260
you and there's yeah yeah I'm sitting right here so say it I'm I'm got the

33:25.260 --> 33:31.140
tons of Celtic and then you know Slavic mix which means I can't out drink

33:31.140 --> 33:35.820
anybody and it also means you're very Enya-esque

33:37.300 --> 33:44.300
anyways yeah we looked at the wedding location crap and that's about it I

33:44.300 --> 33:48.420
thought about playing Final Fantasy but I had other things I was working on so I

33:48.420 --> 33:57.120
I can't do that. I've started to get another project, so this one does not involve any

33:57.120 --> 34:05.420
actual purchasing of anything or any sort of actual monetary dedication. So, yeah. But

34:05.420 --> 34:11.480
it's going to take a very, very, very, very, very long time to finish.

34:11.480 --> 34:16.720
quotes from the chat room www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat.

34:16.720 --> 34:22.480
SSJ100Matt says they say 65 to 75 percent of men masturbate on their

34:22.480 --> 34:31.640
honeymoon. Also 53 percent of statistics are made up on the spot I

34:31.640 --> 34:38.960
guess I don't know. All right anyway let's move on. Loki did you have any

34:38.960 --> 34:39.960
thoughts?

34:39.960 --> 34:40.960
God damn!

34:40.960 --> 34:41.960
Ow!

34:41.960 --> 34:42.960
My foot!

34:42.960 --> 34:43.960
Why did I shoot myself in my foot?

34:43.960 --> 34:44.960
I didn't do it in the conversation.

34:44.960 --> 34:45.960
No!

34:45.960 --> 34:46.960
My foot!

34:46.960 --> 34:47.960
I need that for walking!

34:47.960 --> 34:58.080
No, we were talking about clips of you that I like to have.

34:58.080 --> 34:59.080
I like to have them handy.

34:59.080 --> 35:04.640
I like to save them for a rainy day because, you know, some days I'm feeling sad and I

35:04.640 --> 35:10.020
I got yelled at at work and you know I'm not able to do something on the computer or something

35:10.020 --> 35:17.120
so I have to come in and then I get cheered up.

35:17.120 --> 35:21.760
I'm working on something cool. It'll be fun.

35:21.760 --> 35:25.840
Seegard. Hi. How was your week? How was your day?

35:25.840 --> 35:28.080
Why did we switch back to my old name from last year?

35:28.080 --> 35:30.040
I don't know. I felt...

35:30.040 --> 35:31.040
You have many names.

35:31.040 --> 35:32.040
It's confusing to me.

35:32.040 --> 35:34.040
or no, we're not having a show next week.

35:34.040 --> 35:36.040
If you're next, yeah, we'll just call you Seagletov.

35:36.040 --> 35:38.040
I like that.

35:38.040 --> 35:40.040
I don't.

35:40.040 --> 35:42.040
Well, could I call you Mickey Gert?

35:42.040 --> 35:44.040
That's kind of funny.

35:44.040 --> 35:46.040
I called you Mickey Gert last week,

35:46.040 --> 35:48.040
but I think more people know you as Seagert.

35:48.040 --> 35:50.040
More people know you as Seagert.

35:50.040 --> 35:52.040
I think I should have called you Seagert last week.

35:52.040 --> 35:54.040
Okay, but it doesn't matter to me.

35:54.040 --> 35:56.040
Nobody cares anymore anyway.

35:56.040 --> 35:58.040
You're too busy writing in pencil, too.

35:58.040 --> 36:00.040
Dude, I'm playing minigames.

36:00.040 --> 36:02.260
We're talking about work, I thought we were talking about now.

36:02.260 --> 36:04.140
I got my hair cut.

36:04.140 --> 36:05.140
That's about it.

36:05.140 --> 36:06.140
And it's cute.

36:06.140 --> 36:07.140
Thank you.

36:07.140 --> 36:08.140
I like his new haircut quite a bit.

36:08.140 --> 36:10.180
It's too bad the webcam sucks and we can't use it right now.

36:10.180 --> 36:12.980
I can hold the microphone up to my hair and see if that helps.

36:12.980 --> 36:14.980
Okay, let's see.

36:14.980 --> 36:18.740
Do you hear that, y'all?

36:18.740 --> 36:19.740
That sounds like hair.

36:19.740 --> 36:21.980
That sounds like hair.

36:21.980 --> 36:23.580
I didn't do much else.

36:23.580 --> 36:28.300
I worked and I came here and...

36:28.300 --> 36:32.220
Any songs getting you stuck in your head at work lately?

36:32.220 --> 36:39.020
Only the ones I keep on my PSP from Echo Image that has nothing to do with DDR, or my British

36:39.020 --> 36:41.060
band Manson I like.

36:41.060 --> 36:43.540
I see.

36:43.540 --> 36:44.540
Just prying.

36:44.540 --> 36:48.300
The only thing to drink?

36:48.300 --> 36:49.300
Forget it.

36:49.300 --> 36:50.300
What?

36:50.300 --> 36:51.300
I don't understand.

36:51.300 --> 36:55.460
You have no idea how much Radiohead I've been listening to the last week.

36:55.460 --> 36:56.460
Why?

36:56.460 --> 36:57.460
Is that your angry band?

36:57.460 --> 37:03.820
is not an angler than my depressed band. That makes sense. Every other song that popped

37:03.820 --> 37:10.280
up on my iPod has been Radiohead or Super Furry Animals. My depressed music, and I hate

37:10.280 --> 37:14.940
to admit this because it's going to make me sound so gay, but my depression music is Tori

37:14.940 --> 37:19.780
Amos. Like, if I break it out the Tori, just get away. I wanted to slit my wrist after

37:19.780 --> 37:26.940
listening to a combo of Radiohead, Bjork, Gloomy Sunday, and Tori Amos. You know, I

37:26.940 --> 37:30.940
I wanted to slit my wrists after hearing Bjork's latest album as well, but that's just because it fucking sucked.

37:30.940 --> 37:33.940
I liked it. I thought it was very stylish.

37:33.940 --> 37:35.940
I didn't like it. That's alright.

37:35.940 --> 37:38.940
That's because you need to expand your horizons.

37:38.940 --> 37:39.940
Broaden them.

37:39.940 --> 37:45.940
Hey, my musical horizons are very broad. I mean, look at my selection.

37:45.940 --> 37:47.940
Trans-Ombiate!

37:47.940 --> 37:52.940
Britney, Christina, Hilary Duff, Backstreet Boys...

37:52.940 --> 37:55.940
No, I'm kidding. I don't listen to that crap.

37:55.940 --> 38:02.180
You have one Britney Spears song. You have the expansive music taste of a teenage girl.

38:02.180 --> 38:05.220
Yes, that's a very good description.

38:05.220 --> 38:10.980
Thank you. Speaking of music, it's quite funny. You know that one song by Gwen Stefani,

38:10.980 --> 38:13.980
Hollaback Girl? Never heard it, thank God.

38:13.980 --> 38:17.540
This shit is Bananas. B-A-M-A. Yeah, okay.

38:17.540 --> 38:21.860
So Nellie was singing the song like all week but with the wrong lyrics

38:21.860 --> 38:25.060
because she didn't know what the lyrics were and I'm trying to remember where they were but it's

38:25.060 --> 38:29.720
something about kenny rogers eight micah eight no carlum back girl or

38:29.720 --> 38:30.920
something like that

38:30.920 --> 38:35.200
uh... put it was really weird

38:35.200 --> 38:37.200
being

38:37.200 --> 38:43.200
the

38:43.200 --> 38:46.540
fighting may have a lot of that i don't know what to do

38:46.540 --> 38:48.340
i don't think that no where she's

38:48.340 --> 38:50.540
her lyrics are actually better than the song so

38:50.540 --> 38:51.840
i will never

38:51.840 --> 38:52.960
ever

38:52.960 --> 38:56.760
ever support anything gwen stephanie does ever again

38:56.760 --> 38:59.960
is this have to do with the fact that every photo she's in now she's with

38:59.960 --> 39:02.720
these like totally fake japanese girls

39:02.720 --> 39:04.560
has everything to do with that

39:04.560 --> 39:06.520
scariest

39:06.520 --> 39:10.060
i do not do you think she's a japanese girl cuz she's not

39:10.060 --> 39:14.520
what she is doing is actually very damaging to

39:14.520 --> 39:16.140
women in general

39:16.140 --> 39:18.600
that's like saying shane's black

39:18.600 --> 39:21.280
uh...

39:21.280 --> 39:27.380
Gwen Stefani no longer receives any bit of support from me that I might ever have.

39:27.380 --> 39:28.380
Never.

39:28.380 --> 39:29.380
You know what's weird?

39:29.380 --> 39:31.260
She is a waste of human flesh.

39:31.260 --> 39:32.260
I was...

39:32.260 --> 39:33.460
And she can't sing for shit.

39:33.460 --> 39:38.060
We were listening to the first, well I mean no doubt had what, three albums before they

39:38.060 --> 39:39.060
got big.

39:39.060 --> 39:40.060
So we were listening to their first big album.

39:40.060 --> 39:41.060
Tragic Kingdom, is that it?

39:41.060 --> 39:43.420
We were listening to Tragic Kingdom the other day in the car.

39:43.420 --> 39:47.180
And I was looking at the linear notes, because I was like the one person that never bought

39:47.180 --> 39:48.180
Tragic Kingdom.

39:48.180 --> 39:49.180
I'm assuming...

39:49.180 --> 39:50.180
I have it.

39:50.180 --> 39:51.180
You have it?

39:51.180 --> 40:00.180
I thought that the first one, yeah, I thought back then I thought it was funny. Yeah, no, no. Now I can't, I can't- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I haven't gotten to my point yet.

40:00.180 --> 40:09.180
But I was looking at the linear notes, I was looking at the pictures and I was like, oh my god, they're so young in these pictures. Like, they're like five years younger than I am now.

40:09.180 --> 40:20.180
And that just made me feel old. When Gwen Stefani looks like five years younger than me, that makes me feel really old. I just wanted to share that.

40:20.180 --> 40:32.020
I got a new high score right now on my Mario game.

40:32.020 --> 40:33.020
Very nice.

40:33.020 --> 40:34.180
What Mario game?

40:34.180 --> 40:37.580
The one where you hit the shells with the paddle.

40:37.580 --> 40:39.700
Good job.

40:39.700 --> 40:45.140
Alright, my week and my day was okay, I guess.

40:45.140 --> 40:47.380
I just did the work thing.

40:47.380 --> 40:51.760
And yesterday I went to IKEA with some friends, including Sigurd, because we picked him up

40:51.760 --> 40:54.520
at the BART and then went over to IKEA.

40:54.520 --> 40:58.620
And if they don't have IKEA in your neighborhood, then too bad for you because IKEA is very

40:58.620 --> 41:05.900
cool and they sell like, it's totally like my first apartment, the store.

41:05.900 --> 41:06.900
It's great.

41:06.900 --> 41:10.380
And they have, you know, stuff that you, it's Lego furniture because you take it home and

41:10.380 --> 41:11.700
build it yourself.

41:11.700 --> 41:16.620
And I was being a real nasty bitch though because I hadn't eaten in like 12 hours and

41:16.620 --> 41:19.740
I was getting a massive headache it was really really bad like I don't know what

41:19.740 --> 41:25.440
it was and so the only cure was Swedish meatballs from Ikea so I had to wait in

41:25.440 --> 41:28.480
line for like 30 minutes to get Swedish meatballs and that was cool because

41:28.480 --> 41:34.020
Swedish meatballs rock and then we my buddy John bought like a new bookshelf

41:34.020 --> 41:37.440
and it was so big that it wouldn't fit in the trunk of his car so he had to lay

41:37.440 --> 41:40.520
it out in the backseat except the only problem was is that he was taking five

41:40.520 --> 41:44.220
people in his car so there were three of us in the backseat with a new bookshelf

41:44.220 --> 41:47.860
shelf, and I think my feet are still in a little bit of pain. I don't know about you,

41:47.860 --> 41:52.500
Sigurd, but my feet are in pain.

41:52.500 --> 41:57.420
You don't know pain until you ride in the back of VW Bug crammed with four people in

41:57.420 --> 41:58.420
the back seat.

41:58.420 --> 42:05.500
You don't know pain until you're forced to sit through a Britney Spears marathon.

42:05.500 --> 42:07.060
Which we might do tonight if we run out of show.

42:07.060 --> 42:12.820
Actually, I do know that kind of pain, because I sat through a marathon of, what was it,

42:12.820 --> 42:13.820
Chaotic.

42:13.820 --> 42:17.820
I just found out that I'm going to go see George Carlin on the 9th.

42:17.820 --> 42:18.820
Well, that's kind of cool.

42:18.820 --> 42:23.820
Yeah. And then go see the guy who does the Here's Your Sign.

42:23.820 --> 42:26.820
You know, when you first said George Carlin, this is what a dummy I am.

42:26.820 --> 42:31.820
When you first said George Carlin, I was thinking of the guy from the P-Funk All-Stars with, like, the rainbow in his hair.

42:31.820 --> 42:32.820
That's...

42:32.820 --> 42:34.820
I know, it's something completely different.

42:34.820 --> 42:34.820
Clinton.

42:34.820 --> 42:37.820
It's George Clinton.

42:37.820 --> 42:38.820
I'm like, wait a minute. No, no, no.

42:38.820 --> 42:40.820
Dude, I'd go see Carlin too if I could.

42:40.820 --> 42:48.820
I know, but I can totally see you at a Parliament-funk concert, it'd be hilarious.

42:48.820 --> 42:50.820
George Carlin is freaking awesome.

42:50.820 --> 42:55.820
Yeah, and then George Carlin is the seven words you can't say guy.

42:55.820 --> 42:58.820
And then what's his name? Bill Engvall?

42:58.820 --> 42:59.820
Engvall.

42:59.820 --> 43:01.820
We're going to go see him in November.

43:01.820 --> 43:04.820
Bill Engvall is with Blue Collar TV, and I don't like that show.

43:04.820 --> 43:09.380
There's one, no actually one of the guys that's on the Blue Collar Comedy Tour, the like really

43:09.380 --> 43:13.340
angry one, he's actually pretty good because his comedy isn't all redneck comedy, it's

43:13.340 --> 43:15.620
just pretty, it's just normal comedy.

43:15.620 --> 43:20.240
Whereas like, you know, Jeff Foxworthy couldn't do normal stand-up comedy, you know, his life

43:20.240 --> 43:21.240
depended on.

43:21.240 --> 43:25.620
Um, but I can't remember if Bill Engvall's the good one or not, it's um, the guy that's

43:25.620 --> 43:29.180
in the black, like, like shirt or whatever that they have him on.

43:29.180 --> 43:32.000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, the black shirt.

43:32.000 --> 43:35.000
He's always wearing black on their god damn shows, kay?

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
Johnny Cash?

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
I don't...

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
He's dead!

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
Dead!

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
The man in black is dead.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
Thank you.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
Whatever.

43:43.000 --> 43:44.000
Okay, I'm dead.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
Alright.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
Uh, yeah, so IKEA.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
That was pretty much my week.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
That's all I'm gonna say.

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
Alright.

43:50.000 --> 43:53.180
Well, you also watched Touch of Satan.

43:53.180 --> 43:54.180
I did.

43:54.180 --> 43:57.560
I watched Touch of Satan at the Mystery Science Theater thing, and that was...

43:57.560 --> 43:58.560
The Touch of Satan one...

43:58.560 --> 44:03.200
I don't know, like, I don't find Mystery Science Theater 3000, like, hilarious, like a lot

44:03.200 --> 44:08.920
of my friends do, but I appreciate it, I respect it, I just don't laugh out loud a lot, but

44:08.920 --> 44:13.200
that Touch of Satan, the bad thing is, is I was actually sitting there watching, you

44:13.200 --> 44:16.120
know, the Mystery Science Theater thing, and I'm kind of going, you know, I'm kind of curious

44:16.120 --> 44:22.040
what this movie is like without all the talking.

44:22.040 --> 44:24.120
I don't know why, I think I just like bad movies.

44:24.120 --> 44:27.960
I don't know why, some of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 movies are really funny, some

44:27.960 --> 44:32.960
or not. This island earth can be yours if the price is right. And my other favorite

44:32.960 --> 44:39.560
line in that one, my own private airfield. Which one is that from? The movie. And then

44:39.560 --> 44:47.040
there's the one with the gunslinger, which is one of my favorites, with the female sheriff.

44:47.040 --> 44:51.120
That one's really wrong. What was it, the touch of Satan, it had some wonderful lines

44:51.120 --> 44:56.160
about like, they kept making references to walnut farming or something like that. And

44:56.160 --> 45:01.640
like he's oh no my my prize walnut died or something like that because manos the hands

45:01.640 --> 45:09.480
of fate where they showed the movie so awful that the doctor and the assistant both apologized

45:09.480 --> 45:15.440
for making them watch it and then they came out in the robe with feet on it i have futos

45:15.440 --> 45:21.720
no pedos that was it blink blink blink i'm lost that's right all right i have one more

45:21.720 --> 45:25.720
little thing okay we watched the episode where they kept talking about waffles one night

45:25.720 --> 45:30.380
when I lived in Alabama. I had waffles Saturday night. Lovely. I just wanted to share. My

45:30.380 --> 45:35.560
friend and I wanted waffles so bad after watching this episode that we ran to the Super Walmart,

45:35.560 --> 45:41.600
bought waffles, and came back and ate a whole box of waffles. Okay, once again at Walmart.

45:41.600 --> 45:47.400
At Walmart. Hey, as in Alabama though, we did not have Target then. Alright. Yeah, we're

45:47.400 --> 45:51.120
gonna go, well we're gonna go to a break and then we'll go get them. Well, not a full break

45:51.120 --> 45:55.560
though, we're just gonna do one song real quick because the chat room requested this,

45:55.560 --> 46:01.640
Because it is Father's Day, so Happy Father's Day to all the fathers out there listening.

46:01.640 --> 46:05.880
I don't know if we have any fathers that listen to this show, but if we do, hi, and Happy

46:05.880 --> 46:07.720
Father's Day to you.

46:07.720 --> 46:09.480
Did you guys do anything special today?

46:09.480 --> 46:13.600
I forgot to call my daddy, but my daddy lives in a trailer by Lake Eufaula now.

46:13.600 --> 46:14.600
Oh, okay.

46:14.600 --> 46:17.440
I went and saw Batman Begins with my dad.

46:17.440 --> 46:18.440
How was that?

46:18.440 --> 46:19.480
It was good, actually.

46:19.480 --> 46:21.120
Best Batman ever.

46:21.120 --> 46:22.120
Best Batman ever?

46:22.120 --> 46:24.500
No, seriously, best Batman movie ever.

46:24.500 --> 46:27.060
go see it. We highly recommend it. You will not be disappointed.

46:27.060 --> 46:30.340

48:10.420 --> 48:13.340
there in that song actually you know

48:13.340 --> 48:17.340
just remember your dad could be like that that song is about a guy cheating on his

48:17.340 --> 48:22.140
woman saying he's off with his baby mama don't want no scrub

48:22.140 --> 48:23.340
anyway

48:23.340 --> 48:26.260
we have uh... now somebody who hasn't been on the show a whole lot but we have my

48:26.260 --> 48:28.740
roommate here hi hello how are you

48:28.740 --> 48:31.500
I'm doing well. How are you? Do you have a stage name you want to use?

48:31.500 --> 48:36.380
Um, Extifer. Extifer. Okay, Extifer.

48:36.380 --> 48:40.060
Extifer, you used to work at Walmart, correct?

48:40.060 --> 48:43.900
I did. I used to work at Walmart. This is true. Right. Okay, so we've been talking about

48:43.900 --> 48:45.340
Walmart tonight and just

48:45.340 --> 48:49.660
we were talking during the show about, um, what was it, Jamie, you said you said you didn't want to

48:49.660 --> 48:53.580
old up, or end up like an old woman who weighs... I don't want to be one of those middle-aged,

48:53.580 --> 48:56.060
300-pound women in a moo-moo with five chillins.

48:56.060 --> 49:03.060
Momma, I want me a new Barbie. Momma, get me some chicken.

49:04.060 --> 49:09.060
And so it had me thinking, well we should be asking Xtaphir about the funny people that show up at Walmart.

49:09.060 --> 49:14.060
So do you have any interesting like 400 pound women that buy like thongpanny stories or anything?

49:14.060 --> 49:24.060
We, I don't have like any 400 pound women buying thong stories, but like I had a bunch of like guys by the,

49:24.060 --> 49:27.900
like Walmart used to have this like promotion or something like that

49:27.900 --> 49:31.460
like that had to do with thong underwear and they were like stripper thong

49:31.460 --> 49:32.140
underwear

49:32.140 --> 49:36.200
like the flashy kind and like a bunch of... Wait, you're talking about guy

49:36.200 --> 49:39.380
thong underwear? Yeah, guy thong underwear. Okay.

49:39.380 --> 49:43.260
And like a bunch of like heavyset

49:43.260 --> 49:46.820
like latino guys like came through my line like one time

49:46.820 --> 49:50.180
and bought a bunch of them and I just thought it was kinda weird.

49:50.180 --> 49:53.700
Is that all they bought? Yeah, it was actually.

49:53.700 --> 49:56.820
You know what else would have been funny if they'd bought like all those thongs and a

49:56.820 --> 49:59.780
jar of mayonnaise or something? Just to kind of throw you?

49:59.780 --> 50:04.100
I don't remember any mayonnaise, but the thongs were still funny.

50:04.100 --> 50:09.660
Wait, so they were buying, like there were how many of them?

50:09.660 --> 50:14.580
I don't remember off the top of my head, but maybe like three or four probably.

50:14.580 --> 50:18.060
And then they were buying like just ten? They bought them together, that's the funny

50:18.060 --> 50:23.900
about it is I mean I don't know like if you're gonna buy some thong underwear I

50:23.900 --> 50:29.820
guess invite your friends maybe it was less embarrassing to buy together I

50:29.820 --> 50:33.740
don't know well now what is what is the policy on that see obviously you can't

50:33.740 --> 50:37.380
point and laugh at them and go haha you're buying underwear oh I have I have

50:37.380 --> 50:42.020
a good poker face so I'm just like you know I just ran through and let yeah

50:42.020 --> 50:46.560
then had my laughs afterwards in the break room so you know like as you're

50:46.560 --> 50:49.520
grabbing the underwear and putting it on the scanner, are you thinking, this is going to

50:49.520 --> 50:51.960
be touching some fat guy's balls pretty soon?

50:51.960 --> 50:55.200
Actually, I do think that.

50:55.200 --> 50:58.200
But I'm just glad that it hasn't yet.

50:58.200 --> 51:00.240
Anyhow.

51:00.240 --> 51:05.000
Any other wonderful, glorious Walmart stories you want to share?

51:05.000 --> 51:07.600
If I do come up with any, I'll let you know.

51:07.600 --> 51:08.600
All right.

51:08.600 --> 51:09.600
Sounds good.

51:09.600 --> 51:10.600
Thank you.

51:10.600 --> 51:12.280
We should make this a regular segment where you come tell us a funny Walmart story.

51:12.280 --> 51:14.440
So you get to work on next week's edition.

51:14.440 --> 51:15.440
Or we're not here next week.

51:15.440 --> 51:17.440
You have two weeks to come up with another one. That's a lot of time.

51:17.440 --> 51:18.440
Alright, you do that.

51:18.440 --> 51:19.440
Alright, you do that.

51:19.440 --> 51:21.440
Thank you. Extra firm.

51:23.440 --> 51:26.440
Poor bastard has his house taken over every Sunday by us.

51:27.440 --> 51:29.440
How would you like that?

51:29.440 --> 51:33.440
Well, I have an offer. Open.

51:33.440 --> 51:35.440
Oh, that's true, huh? Yeah.

51:35.440 --> 51:38.440
Yeah, if you don't mind going out to the boonies at Citrus Heights.

51:38.440 --> 51:40.440
I used to live in the boonies at Citrus Heights.

51:40.440 --> 51:42.440
Well, not really the boonies, but...

51:42.440 --> 51:44.440
Not really the boonies. It's a nice neighborhood.

51:44.440 --> 51:45.440
Okay.

51:45.440 --> 51:46.440
Yeah, it's a nice little...

51:46.440 --> 51:47.440
I think I know which area you're going to...

51:47.440 --> 51:48.440
I'm going to have a yard!

51:48.440 --> 51:51.960
Dude, you're going to have to water a yard, or do that, you're going to have to water

51:51.960 --> 51:52.960
a yard?

51:52.960 --> 51:56.480
I'm... shit, no, Dan's job.

51:56.480 --> 51:59.960
My parents are going on vacation, they want me to come over and water.

51:59.960 --> 52:02.720
What's this manual labor stuff?

52:02.720 --> 52:03.720
Alright.

52:03.720 --> 52:10.040
Uh, let's talk about some actual DDR, Bamani-ish news, things going on.

52:10.040 --> 52:15.080
Loki, this is interesting because no other website is running this story except for us,

52:15.080 --> 52:19.160
so I'm assuming this is something you actually found out through your own means, but you're

52:19.160 --> 52:22.640
talking about release dates for some of the new games.

52:22.640 --> 52:29.240
Yeah, it's a perk of being in the video game sales business, so I have the two initial

52:29.240 --> 52:35.880
street dates straight from Konami of when the new games will be coming out, and the

52:35.880 --> 52:40.440
The first one being September 28th, I want to say, for DDR Extreme.

52:40.440 --> 52:45.720
According to our website, our own website, orangehonestrainer.com, DDR Extreme 2 is going

52:45.720 --> 52:54.360
to be out September 28th, 2005, and DDR UltraMix 3, November 2nd, 2005.

52:54.360 --> 52:55.360
That's correct.

52:55.360 --> 52:57.880
Election Day, right?

52:57.880 --> 52:58.880
First Tuesday?

52:58.880 --> 53:01.320
I don't vote.

53:01.320 --> 53:04.480
Thank you for ruining America.

53:04.480 --> 53:09.480
So define what initial street date means. Does this mean it's already solid or what?

53:09.480 --> 53:14.480
Let me give you an idea of how solid game street dates are. There's this game called

53:14.480 --> 53:19.480
Psychonauts. That's right, Psychonauts. It came out on the Xbox not too long ago. It's

53:19.480 --> 53:23.080
supposed to be coming out for the PlayStation 2. This was back in May. It got pushed to

53:23.080 --> 53:27.960
June. Then it got pushed to July. Then it went back to June. Back to July, then back

53:27.960 --> 53:34.500
to June and it finally came out in June but so it depends certain companies

53:34.500 --> 53:39.660
they'll move the dates around a little bit it being about you know a ways away

53:39.660 --> 53:43.940
date wise you know three months away it's possible it can move I don't think

53:43.940 --> 53:46.920
it will I'd be just because Konami is pretty good on their dates other

53:46.920 --> 53:53.100
companies like EA and I don't know um Rockstar and anybody that's owned by

53:53.100 --> 54:00.380
jack-of-all-games, their dates are all fucked up. All over the place. But, yeah, so basically

54:00.380 --> 54:04.100
I think that's probably pretty solid, just because the other two games before came out

54:04.100 --> 54:06.980
around the same time, so it makes sense, you know.

54:06.980 --> 54:10.100
Interesting. I tried it, and Seagrid left the room, but I...

54:10.100 --> 54:13.300
Well, I'll let you know, like, as we're getting closer, when they're coming out, because I

54:13.300 --> 54:17.940
am the one that actually keeps track of our date changes in our system, so...

54:17.940 --> 54:21.500
That's cool. Good. So you're taking it to OrangeLaundry.com. Love it, love it.

54:21.500 --> 54:22.500
Yeah.

54:22.500 --> 54:25.500
And then, Karaoke Revolution Party Edition. I know that's coming out too.

54:25.500 --> 54:29.500
Oh, and also the bundle I think is going to be $69, I think.

54:29.500 --> 54:30.500
What bundle?

54:30.500 --> 54:36.500
For, um, it's UltraMix III, I think, is their bundle. $69 retail.

54:36.500 --> 54:39.500
I hear the Xbox pad's really good. I've never played with one.

54:39.500 --> 54:44.500
But I still use my Red Octane Ignition because it hasn't broke yet, so it serves me well.

54:44.500 --> 54:47.500
And I know Taiko No Tatujin 2's coming out at some point.

54:47.500 --> 54:48.500
Really? Or you mean Taiko Drum Master?

54:48.500 --> 54:49.500
Whatever.

54:49.500 --> 54:53.500
I don't know. You gotta post more about the other games, too, not just the two.

54:53.500 --> 54:55.500
I try. I'm like trying to keep track of...

54:55.500 --> 54:59.500
Literally, there's a date change every day of the goddamn week.

54:59.500 --> 55:06.500
Seriously, there's all these games that don't exist that our Dallas people are saying that do exist,

55:06.500 --> 55:10.500
and I tell them that they're not, and then they're wrong, and yeah.

55:10.500 --> 55:18.500
Anyway, these dates should really come as no surprise, because it's always been kind of assumed

55:18.500 --> 55:22.100
both games are coming out in the fall and honestly we kind of have a pattern going here

55:22.100 --> 55:29.340
now from the past two years and you know we usually get extreme September-ish and we get

55:29.340 --> 55:34.420
the UltraMix games November-ish so this really isn't a surprise at all that these dates are

55:34.420 --> 55:35.420
the way they are.

55:35.420 --> 55:38.160
Although one is really close to the end of month and one is really close to the beginning.

55:38.160 --> 55:42.500
I don't remember the games coming out so close together because they're only about four weeks

55:42.500 --> 55:47.420
apart at this point and I think previously we've had like seven or eight weeks in between

55:47.420 --> 55:52.100
indie games, so that's one thing. Well, it's really like, you know, as far as the release

55:52.100 --> 55:55.900
schedule or whatever. Seegard, you're back. Now, I don't know what you can tell me and

55:55.900 --> 55:59.700
can't tell me about NDAs. We're talking about the release dates for Extreme 2 and Ultra

55:59.700 --> 56:08.700
Mix 3. Are they close? Or what? What do you know? I honestly know nothing about the release

56:08.700 --> 56:15.740
dates, except what online retail sites are saying, and usually you can trust those if

56:15.740 --> 56:22.060
If it's not Red Octane putting out the game, sorry, but let's face it, you pushed back

56:22.060 --> 56:23.060
three times.

56:23.060 --> 56:26.980
If it's not in the groove, it usually has a pretty good release date, and if they report

56:26.980 --> 56:32.340
on it, they usually get that from the company, but I haven't seen any official things in

56:32.340 --> 56:33.340
the office.

56:33.340 --> 56:37.460
It's kind of weird that he would find out before you, but I guess that's the way it

56:37.460 --> 56:38.460
goes.

56:38.460 --> 56:39.780
Well, he doesn't deal with the sales end of it.

56:39.780 --> 56:47.780
We've also gotten GameStop has most of them too, so I'd just ask Dan if everyone would know anything.

56:47.780 --> 56:49.780
They're all in the same mailing list.

56:49.780 --> 56:53.780
What I want to know is when are those vrares, assuming that both are going to have a vrare again,

56:53.780 --> 56:57.780
I don't see why they wouldn't because I think people like those and Konami likes it when people like things.

56:57.780 --> 57:02.780
Assuming we're getting new vrares, I'm not going to bother asking Seeker because he'll just tell me NDA,

57:02.780 --> 57:06.780
but assuming we're getting new vrares, the question is when will those come out?

57:06.780 --> 57:09.780
Do we get them maybe before, with a pre-order, or are we just going to get them the day of the game?

57:09.780 --> 57:14.780
Well, you know, maybe we can get some hookups with those people from Konami of Japan checking on our show.

57:16.780 --> 57:23.780
We were perusing our website statistic logs for another project, and we were looking at some of the domains that have been visiting us,

57:23.780 --> 57:29.780
and we were kind of happy with some of the ones we saw. So, hi to our friends at Konami of Japan who listen secretly to our show.

57:29.780 --> 57:31.780
What time is it there?

57:31.780 --> 57:35.620
Like I don't think they listen to the live show, but I think they're there on the site

57:35.740 --> 57:41.060
Well, they're definitely I was listening to the repeat depending on the time of day. Yes, the DER

57:41.900 --> 57:43.500
comb on why

57:43.500 --> 57:46.740
That's time of day. I don't know. I'm trying to think what time of day it would be that the show repeats

57:46.740 --> 57:54.280
Yes, the DER freak radio rewind every Friday night at six o'clock six or seven check ddrfreak.com for the details

57:54.660 --> 57:56.660
Friday nights over on ddrfreak.com

57:56.660 --> 58:05.980
All right, so there's your release dates for the new games. I think we'll do, we'll

58:05.980 --> 58:09.220
actually go to a longer break right now and when we come back from this break we

58:09.220 --> 58:12.380
got a brand new UltraMix 3 song to play for you guys and we want to talk

58:12.380 --> 58:20.900
about this story. Pump It Up and In The Groove Are Joining Forces and yes we

58:20.900 --> 58:25.340
already knew this in some capacity but I was quite surprised with the news I

58:25.340 --> 58:27.820
heard this week so I'm really curious to see what you guys have to say about

58:27.820 --> 58:33.820
Skypline will be open as well at some point when we come back so let's go to a

58:33.820 --> 58:37.220
break and we'll come back so in this break I think we'll hear some since we

58:37.220 --> 58:40.500
didn't last break we did some DDR songs we haven't heard in a while and this

58:40.500 --> 58:44.940
break we'll do like some 2dx songs we haven't heard in a while so we're gonna

58:44.940 --> 58:51.100
start it off with let's see I don't know what am I in the mood to hear let's hear

58:51.100 --> 58:58.100
We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:24.700
We are your actors, everything's gonna be alright

01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:29.700
I want to make a move for you, can't fake it now

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:34.700
I can't fake it now, I can't fake it, can't fake it, leave me all night

01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:40.700
Yeah, every day, everywhere, I don't even wanna tell

01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:42.700
Can't kite since then

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:46.700
Toppetto nakusho, mohiki dashi wo tanaga lei ri ase

Let's make it, let's go

01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:11.700
I just wanna make it so I can stay

01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:13.700
This is what it is all about

01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:15.700
I just want to make one little one

01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:17.700
You can't make it now

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:19.700
I just can't make it now

01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:21.700
I just can't make a difference

01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:23.700
Right

01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:35.700
And the beat. And the beat.

01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:45.700
And the beat.

01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:19.860
The

01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:23.860
the

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:27.860
the

01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:31.860
the

01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:35.860
the

01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:39.860
the

01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:43.860
the

01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:48.860
Mmm, mmm, mmm

01:04:48.860 --> 01:05:13.500
Just disturbed guys.

01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:15.500
Just a disturbed guy.

01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:18.460
might I add that Final Destination 2 is exactly the same movie as Final Destination 1 just

01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:25.500
gorier. That is about it. It is exactly the same. How did her head get chopped off? She

01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:30.580
was stuck in an elevator door and then, yeah, her head was stuck in an elevator door. I

01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:35.220
don't know. The Final Destination movies were all these crazy death trap scenarios. It was

01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:38.300
like mouse trap, you know? First the ball rolls down the stairs and it rolls down a

01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:42.460
little tube and it sets off the guy who jumps off the bed. You know, all that crap. I love

01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:47.460
That's like the Final Destination movies. It's like Mouse Trap the movie, except people die in hideous ways.

01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:54.460
That'd be hilarious if there was a movie where the villain, like, his calling card was the Mouse Trap game, and then, like, the whole thing would set off a bomb at the end.

01:06:54.460 --> 01:07:01.460
The only problem with Mouse Trap, though, is that sometimes it didn't go off just right. You know, it gets stuck or something. So I guess that wouldn't work.

01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:02.460
work.

01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:07.480
Well anyway, I don't know, this guy with a hook got the chick's hair and then she ended

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:09.380
up getting stuck in the door because of it.

01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:13.260
I don't know, whatever, and then it was like, ew blood, and then Extra First said something

01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:14.740
about that all the...

01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:18.120
I haven't seen Final Destination 2, I've only seen the first one, but he said something

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:21.300
about Kool-Aid, all the blood looks like Kool-Aid, just...

01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:24.500
Yeah, there's a lot of CG blood in this one.

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:25.500
I see.

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:31.540
and gets killed by a giant like window falling on them and like flattens them

01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:36.900
by the way if we're spoiling the movie for you good just don't bother watching

01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:41.900
it actually the same fucking movie you know the first movie I don't want to

01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:44.220
spend too much time talking about a series of movies it's over five years

01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:48.380
old but when we went saw the first movie in the theater you remember that scene

01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:52.900
where the chick gets hit by the bus my best friend at the time and I were

01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:57.860
laughing and laughing and laughing and people were turning around in the

01:07:57.860 --> 01:08:01.540
theater looking at us going you insensitive bastards that girl just got

01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:04.880
splattered all over the street and we're laughing and laughing cuz it's the way

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:14.300
that it happens she's all screws like here comes the bus in Jurassic Park 3

01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:19.520
when they were pulling the people out of the field buffet buffet I haven't seen

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:24.040
Jurassic Park 3 because it just, you know, it was Jurassic Park 3, and I figured one

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:25.040
and two was the-

01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:26.040
It was with the raptors.

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:27.040
Really?

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:32.920
They were, they were, these people were crossing the fields and the velociraptors were running

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:37.360
through this tall field, and just, you'd see little people, whoop, disappear, whoop, disappear,

01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:40.760
and we were like, it's a buffet for the raptors.

01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:44.360
See, for a second there, before she mentioned raptors, I thought it might have been like,

01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:50.120
know, I don't know, maybe um, Rosie O'Donnell or something in the field that, she might

01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:55.920
have been like, you know, snatching people because, you never know.

01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:56.920
Thanks.

01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:58.040
Alright.

01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:03.440
Back to um, the gaming realm, which we talk about here on this show, brand new UltraMix

01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:04.880
3 news this week.

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:08.620
Last week, we got to unveil this, because nobody else found this, we were the first

01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:13.200
to find this, that Spray had actually announced on their website that they were going to have

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:16.840
new song in Ultramix 3 called I Am Gothic and we played this song for you guys last

01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:29.840
night to which it sounds like most of you guys had a bit of an eh reception. I like

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:33.360
the song. I know Seagrid likes the song but the rest of you guys are kind of eh. Here's

01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:40.360
Here's a little reminder of IAMGothic.

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:48.480
So,

01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:53.800
now this has already previously been announced on DDR Freaks in the

01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:57.200
official UltraMix 3 thread. We don't get to be the first to tell you about this because we didn't

01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:58.400
find this, somebody else did.

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:02.400
A user here by the name of Rockus,

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:05.920
who I think is also one of our listeners, so you go boy,

01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:06.760
found this one.

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:10.200
And it's actually a link to a magazine website,

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:13.440
Virus Magazine, which I think has to do

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:15.240
with like industrial music.

01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:19.220
And sure enough, another band has themselves said

01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:21.260
that they have a song in UltraMix 3,

01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:23.660
and it's a band called the Azoic.

01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:26.300
The Azoic used to be on different drum,

01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:27.700
and I don't think they're on there anymore,

01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:29.420
but they used to be on different drum.

01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:31.260
And I think it's kind of neat that the Azoic

01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:35.460
moving over into DDR because I actually bought the Ozoic's last album of which

01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:41.380
this song a remix of the song is on so I think that's kind of neat based off of

01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:44.260
samples I heard on a different drum when Ultramix 2 got popular so I'm kind of

01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:48.740
excited about that anyway the song is called conflict and it's the turmoil

01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:53.260
mix and then the rest of the article talks about how the Ozoic.com has been

01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:56.740
down lately but at least we get to find out a new song so hey I'm liking this

01:10:56.740 --> 01:11:00.660
trend since Sigurd won't tell us anything about the song list just

01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:04.240
kidding I know you're under contract or whatever the artists themselves are

01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:07.600
starting to spill the beans about the song so now we have another confirmed

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:12.600
song thanks to a band with a big mouth the Azoic and Conflict so we're gonna

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:17.340
hear the song you guys ready yes as we got it here on Orange Lounge Radio

01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:21.320
because that's what we do we find songs and we play them for you yep so here is

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:27.000
a brand new song from DDR Ultra Mix 3 the band is called the Azoic and this is

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Conflict, the Turmoil Mix, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Oh

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:05.000
You're the only one here that knows the world that you live in

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:12.000
You know I see the light inside my face, I let you rise

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:18.000
You'll come and I will be with you until the sun gets gray

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:25.000
I know you know I'll be with you until the sun gets gray

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Keep walking, keep walking for me

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Walk this one, you'll be the way

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000
You'll be here as the world

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Walk, walk, walk, here as the one thing it can

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.000
And I'll walk to your view on the sand

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:18.000
I never knew what to be

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Oh

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.500
Go away from you, please don't play

01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:54.500
You'll be here at home now

01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:57.500
Go home, go clear at home

01:15:57.500 --> 01:16:00.000
Take your time and go

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.000
On to your new home now

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:07.000
And I never knew what to do

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
If I be a king

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:45.200
Orange Lawn's radio premiere there of Conflict, the turmoil mix.

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:50.260
Coming up from DDR, UltraMix III is going to be the game that has that song in it.

01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:54.260
And that was announced by the band, or at least a magazine on behalf of the band.

01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:55.900
I don't know how that works there.

01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:58.540
But the beans were spilled, and there it is.

01:16:58.540 --> 01:17:00.380
That song's going to be in UltraMix III.

01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:01.000
What do you guys think?

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.900
Now keep in mind, the song there clocks in at 5 and 1 half minutes,

01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:08.180
but they edit these songs down to a minute and a half, two minute range.

01:17:08.180 --> 01:17:09.620
You'll get like a verse and a chorus.

01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:10.300
What do you think?

01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:13.020
sounds like the stuff that they play at Rapture. It's pretty cool.

01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:17.140
Yeah, you know, I think it's kind of ironic that we got last week the I Am

01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:19.460
Gothic song, which is a little tongue-in-cheek.

01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:23.260
It wasn't really a goth song, but it wasn't really, like, anti-goth. It was just a tongue-in-cheek.

01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:27.300
Like, it was a weird owl of goth, I think, to me. It's kinda

01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:31.020
synth-pop, I don't know. In a way, in a way.

01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:34.860
We get that song last week, and now we get this this week. So they actually play it

01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:39.180
the the we get like an actual like industrial goth

01:17:39.180 --> 01:17:42.140
kinda sounding song that you would hear at a club. It was cool, I like it.

01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:46.380
Uh, Loki. Are they like suffering or lacking in the goth demographic

01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:50.220
as for DDR or something? Because this is what it seems like. It's like,

01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:53.900
how can we, you know, get those goths to play a

01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:59.820
pop dance game? Let's put some some sad music in there. No, I, I don't know. It's

01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:03.820
just, it's okay, I guess. But let's just, hopefully

01:18:03.820 --> 01:18:07.900
the next few artists that announce that their songs are going to be in there will be a little

01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:10.620
something different than, say, I don't know, goth music.

01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:14.540
Well, now, you know, I'm sure they're going to have a variety of music, as they always

01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:18.220
do, and Konami's not the one releasing this information either. It's coming from the artists

01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:24.060
themselves, so maybe the gothic bands are just excited about DDR. I don't know. I don't

01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:25.860
know what to say about that, so.

01:18:25.860 --> 01:18:28.780
Well, whatever. I mean, it's just...

01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:29.780
It's okay.

01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:32.220
I didn't really care for that song too much, actually.

01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:34.820
Seegerd, what do you think of the Ozoic?

01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:36.980
I really, really, really like that song.

01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:43.700
And it got stuck in my head for about a week when I had heard it previously.

01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:45.660
But yeah, it's a good song.

01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:46.160
I like it.

01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:49.020
I'm glad it's in the game.

01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:52.420
Me personally, I'm thrilled that that song made the game.

01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:54.980
I think it's kind of weird because it's interesting

01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:58.020
as I'm looking at the chat room reaction.

01:18:58.020 --> 01:19:00.460
And a lot of folks are saying, I'm liking this.

01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:01.140
Me likey.

01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:06.180
it's a very upbeat kind of song. I like this, Arcadian42 says I hate myself and I

01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:17.660
want to DDR. It's kind of a sad song to me it's a very

01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:21.860
like kind of downbeat although it is upbeat dancy it's definitely a song that

01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:26.780
will work for DDR it's it's kind of depressing in a way to me so and then I

01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:31.740
I think about UltraMix 3's theme and all the happy bubble water theme and the, you

01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:37.500
know, yeah it's DDR with all these happy characters, and I'm like, I love goth music and DDR, I'm

01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:45.020
gonna go drown myself now. I don't know, it's kind of, just interesting, so. I'm sure not

01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:49.700
every song is gonna be a goth song, I think it's just, just a coincidence. We need DDR

01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:58.620
mix. I would so, like, buy that. I'm so gothic that I play DDR in Bach mode. Dude,

01:19:58.620 --> 01:20:06.940
DDR UltraMix just goth served us. Alright, so we'll see what artist spills the

01:20:06.940 --> 01:20:13.060
beans next. My advice, this is what we've had now, one, two folks from that are

01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:18.380
somehow related to a different drum, even though maybe directly or not, keep an eye

01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:24.540
on the websites for these guys. Don't forget that Midihead is also related to a different

01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:27.300
drum. And Midihead is on a different drum, and we already know that Raise Your Hands

01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:31.060
is going to be in there. We played that a few weeks ago. So, also kind of a, not so

01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:38.220
much a goth song, but an industrial-ish song. So, kind of interesting. My advice, keep an

01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:41.880
eye on those websites, those different drum artists, because one of them is bound to spill

01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:47.260
the beans next. I don't think three is, it seems like last time we had more than three

01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:50.500
different drum licenses so I'm thinking there's got to be at least at least a

01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:56.460
couple more so we'll see all right I like this now the chat room is going off

01:20:56.460 --> 01:21:05.080
on this every time you conform you lose a bar interesting all right um moving

01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:11.140
on let's talk about some other big news that's going on in the scene right now

01:21:11.140 --> 01:21:15.340
actually what happened this week is that and the Miro or no I'm sorry rocks or

01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:18.980
put out this press release maybe it was a joint release with Andamiro I don't

01:21:18.980 --> 01:21:24.160
know but it's actually a post that's on rock source forums rock shore games is

01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:28.060
proud to announce their partnership with Andamiro company limited to create the

01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:33.980
next generation of arcade dance games the first collaboration quote pump it up

01:21:33.980 --> 01:21:41.300
colon in the groove to combine end quote combines rock source unparalleled

01:21:41.300 --> 01:21:45.320
gameplay music and graphical content with Andamiro's co-development support

01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:50.040
Superior cabinet construction featuring blah blah blah flat screen, blah blah

01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:54.320
blah stereo system, blah blah blah 130 songs, blah blah blah all the songs from

01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:58.600

blah, you know, singles doubles and all that, you add it up it adds up quick, blah

01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:13.220
blah blah Pump it Up In the Groove 2 is now available from game distributors

01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:17.620
nationwide so that was a little bit of a surprise no surprise there that

01:22:17.620 --> 01:22:20.580
annamiro and rockstar are going to be working together we already knew annamiro

01:22:20.580 --> 01:22:25.100
was helping in the cabinets in some capacity but now in the groove is part

01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:31.980
of the pump it up series weird not really not really what do you think it's

01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:35.900
just a name it's just going to be on probably the cabinets and stuff and it's

01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:39.380
also they probably won the pump it up thing in there so they can steal that

01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:43.740
rolling freezes or freeze rolls or whatever because you know they needed

01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:49.500
another gimmick I've seen some posts about what is a freeze roll and I don't

01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:54.460
remember where I read this but I do know I read it into what is the freeze roll

01:22:54.460 --> 01:22:58.580
a freeze roll which is this new thing they're putting in in the groove to I'm

01:22:58.580 --> 01:23:04.300
sorry pump it up in the groove to is instead of holding like a freeze arrow

01:23:04.300 --> 01:23:08.340
you hold your foot down the freeze roll is you have to tap your foot repeatedly

01:23:08.340 --> 01:23:13.180
like think about paranoia survivor heavy I think it was was it no no was it

01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:17.420
paranoia survivor what's no no no no no no no no no I'm thinking I can't stop

01:23:17.420 --> 01:23:22.500
falling in love is one what was the one in fifth mix the remarried a eternal yes

01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:27.580
paranoid eternal remember like there's one part of it we have to go it's like

01:23:27.580 --> 01:23:31.340
all the same like it's a down arrow or left arrow or something that's what a

01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:35.860
freeze roll is which will kill your foot faster than anything else so I'm like

01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:40.580
hooray it's another thing to hurt myself on in the group sorry pump it up in the

01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:41.780
group

01:23:41.780 --> 01:23:46.540
well what i remember from pump it up because they have that actually in there

01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:50.020
is the more you hit at the more point you get

01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:53.380
during that for ok well that's kinda like uh... like a note

01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:56.520
catches it out there so i'm like that i could attach it in the more you hit or

01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:59.760
don't you know i'm going to have more you hit during one of those roles more

01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:03.540
point you get i think that's well that's not as bad benefits and then senate

01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:07.820
I think that's what it is, but it's still retarded. Whatever. I mean, it's...

01:24:07.820 --> 01:24:12.860
I'm not gonna go, oh, that game was freeze-rolled, I gotta go play it right now.

01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:13.500
No.

01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:15.540
It's okay. I mean,

01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:17.620
okay, they want a new idea.

01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:21.620
Here you go. It's a new idea. Whatever. I'm glad though they have the nice

01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:27.440
widescreen monitor to show off those really bland graphics in a really large, you know, size.

01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:31.740
Because, you know, a game like that just really needs the extra monitor space and

01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:36.580
resolution because, you know, before it couldn't quite show off the bland graphics that were

01:24:36.580 --> 01:24:37.580
in it.

01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:42.300
Well, now, now, in the press release under In the Groove 2, I'm sorry, pump it up, In

01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:47.860
the Groove 2, under the new features, all new graphics, featuring new In the Groove

01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:48.860
characters.

01:24:48.860 --> 01:24:50.260
Oh wow, they're going to be bland too?

01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:56.500
You know, all new graphics meaning, we made it red, that's what it is, we made it red,

01:24:56.500 --> 01:25:00.780
all new graphics, featuring In the Groove characters.

01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:05.780
Where have I seen dancing characters before? Where did I see that?

01:25:05.780 --> 01:25:09.780
Maybe it was in Maniac Mansion.

01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:11.780
That's right, it was Maniac Mansion.

01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:13.780
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:17.780
It was the Jungle Beat game. The Jungle Book, Jungle Beat game.

01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:19.780
Yeah, they did kind of box out.

01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:20.780
Because they had the characters.

01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:23.780
Nowhere else have they seen dancing characters before and they make custom characters.

01:25:23.780 --> 01:25:28.780
In this game, it's actually a DDR sim. It's called StepMania.

01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:35.020
Yeah, in which this game is in no way based on at all.

01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:37.180
Speaking of which, I got a funny story about that later.

01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:39.260
OK.

01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:42.060
Let's see, unlockable songs and expert steps.

01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:45.100
Greatly expanded compatibility for USB memory cards.

01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:47.660
I think I was reading somewhere where the USB will now

01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:51.260
not only download your scores, but the whole damn arcade

01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:55.420
high scores will go on your USB card, which is interesting,

01:25:55.420 --> 01:25:56.220
I guess.

01:25:56.220 --> 01:26:01.020
I think they're trying to formulate this way of doing like a national ranking, which, you

01:26:01.020 --> 01:26:03.940
know what, one thing I really like about In The Groove and I give them a lot of credit

01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:07.940
for it, the USB support is phenomenal and I wish DDR had something like it.

01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:12.020
So I'll give them that and I'm interested to see how they expand on the USB support.

01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:14.860
So that's exciting news to me.

01:26:14.860 --> 01:26:19.780
Novice difficulty with helpers like Traffic Light and Constant Scroll to assist players

01:26:19.780 --> 01:26:22.260
who are just getting started.

01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:24.380
I have no idea what that means, but okay.

01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:34.460
light that sounds interesting let's see 65 new songs this is one other thing I

01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:40.100
like about in the groove vs. DDR because how many times has your DDR machine been

01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:45.800
reset at the local arcade and you cannot get the stupid arcade operator to put in

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:50.300
the code to unlock stoic and all that stuff because you know they they do an

01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:53.840
outside vending company or something so nobody will open the machine even if you

01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:56.840
know the code, you can't put it in. Well, one thing I like about what In The Groove

01:26:56.840 --> 01:27:02.560
does and Pump It Up In The Groove 2 is going to continue is that the unlock codes are actually

01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:08.400
entered by the players via the dance pad. So I think that's good. Smart idea. So that's

01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:13.280
coming back and all that stuff that you've come to know and love or whatever about In

01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:16.280
The Groove. Loki, any more hateful thoughts?

01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:22.600
Well, I got something that's not exactly... It's In The Groove news, but it's not related

01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:25.000
to this particular Indigroov news.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.800
Okay, well try me.

01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:29.080
Okay, well it was basically

01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:32.040
Indigroov was saying,

01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:33.680
our encryption is

01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:36.760
kick-ass and no one will be able to defeat it, yada yada yada.

01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:39.640
Well actually, no it was not.

01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:42.980
Because as soon as the game came out

01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:46.320
for the U.S.

01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:47.720
for the Playstation 2,

01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:52.520
the entire theme, all the movies, and all the music, and all the steps, and

01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:57.840
everything else were ripped almost instantly because, guess what, and this is going to

01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:03.760
be a shocker, it's basically step mania. It's basically step mania. So everything was able

01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:09.960
to be ripped almost, like, without effort and thrown into step mania. So you can get

01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:14.040
that off your local BitTorrent site. I don't know if it's so much that as the fact as when

01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:20.080
people say, we have a great encryption scheme that nobody will be able to hack, that is

01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:25.840
inviting people to come in and hack it. I can think of examples that have nothing to

01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:31.580
do with video games, such as the CD companies, like Sony and stuff, when they said, oh, we're

01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:36.380
going to put out these copy protected CDs, and you will not be able to copy these CDs

01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:40.380
no matter what you do, because it launches a program when you put the CD in, and you

01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:45.180
can't copy the CDs. Well, here's the magic work around that somebody found. Get this.

01:28:45.180 --> 01:28:49.360
hold the shift key when you put in the CD to abort the autorun feature

01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:51.540
copy protection aborted

01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:52.900
so okay

01:28:52.900 --> 01:28:55.220
when somebody says that we cannot be hacked

01:28:55.220 --> 01:28:56.540
that is just an invite

01:28:56.540 --> 01:28:58.700
to somebody to hack them

01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:01.580
I have to laugh because basically here's what

01:29:01.580 --> 01:29:03.540
it's basically uh... and

01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:07.580
and normally when people release you know like themes and stuff it's like okay

01:29:07.580 --> 01:29:10.140
you know hey the fans wanted to go play this and stuff

01:29:10.140 --> 01:29:13.660
well this is just spiteful stuff basically here's

01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:19.860
Here's a little info file that's included with your local Bittorrent version of their theme.

01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:21.660
It'd be, yes, we've done it.

01:29:21.660 --> 01:29:25.180
We've done what those rocks or bastards claim to be impossible.

01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:31.300
Again, we have cracked the encryption, end quotes, that houses the game's files using

01:29:31.300 --> 01:29:34.500
tools made in-house by our cracking experts.

01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:38.860
Since In the Groove is just a rip-off of StepMania, the files were easily portable

01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:40.660
to the StepMania layout.

01:29:40.660 --> 01:29:45.460
This smzip file contains songs, supporting graphics,

01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:47.780
for use in Samania.

01:29:47.780 --> 01:29:49.540
Well, now I'm sure a lot of In the Groove fans

01:29:49.540 --> 01:29:51.200
are going rabble, rabble, rabble at that.

01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:54.060
But you know, that's just some kid showing off their internet

01:29:54.060 --> 01:29:55.300
penis because they cracked it.

01:29:55.300 --> 01:29:56.000
Hooray for you.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:56.500
Good job.

01:29:56.500 --> 01:29:57.900
Whatever.

01:29:57.900 --> 01:30:00.500
Don't take it too personally.

01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:01.740
That type of stuff.

01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:02.940
It's quite funny.

01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:07.300
But basically, you can actually see some rips here

01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:09.820
on itgfreak.com.

01:30:09.820 --> 01:30:16.820
appropriate that they'd be on there, and they're pretty much perfect, granted there's some

01:30:17.340 --> 01:30:23.180
little tweaks. Are the loading times improved when you played in StepMania? I guess. And

01:30:23.180 --> 01:30:29.140
what was up with the whole, I don't know, in the groove of corrupting your save file

01:30:29.140 --> 01:30:33.540
or something like that? I'm surprised that this game was so polished, I mean, I would

01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:38.220
expect something from such a game that, you know... Now, now, now, somebody could just

01:30:38.220 --> 01:30:42.180
come up just as easily and say, you're just picking on him now, because somebody could

01:30:42.180 --> 01:30:47.100
easily come up and say, whoa, in DDR Extreme they have a whole song that was supposed to

01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:51.300
be unlocked that you can't get, da da da, you know, the memories debacle, whatever.

01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:55.420
No, that was basically, you know, cut out the game, but some of the stuff is still in

01:30:55.420 --> 01:31:01.140
the code. That's not, my save file gets erased because that song is not in the game.

01:31:01.140 --> 01:31:04.260
Okay, okay, I'll give you that. There's a slight difference there. There is.

01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:06.460
uh... i'm sorry i mean

01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:09.980
but you you're picking on it but you're picking on it looks like something that

01:31:09.980 --> 01:31:13.260
some would make home brew for the dream cat to me this is what it looks like

01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:14.260
this game

01:31:14.260 --> 01:31:18.380
is just crap i'm sorry i know that we're at work we got enough hate mail last

01:31:18.380 --> 01:31:18.980
week

01:31:18.980 --> 01:31:20.200
cyrd what do you

01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:21.700
what do you think of

01:31:21.700 --> 01:31:22.940
pop it up

01:31:22.940 --> 01:31:27.640
in the group to and i'll say it for you what secret says does not reflect in any

01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:31.440
way shape or form konami data that it uh... and very angry about it

01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:33.900
because as everybody should know by now

01:31:33.900 --> 01:31:34.980
um...

01:31:34.980 --> 01:31:38.200
maybe they don't i'm a huge fan of pump it up

01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:41.100
like half of me is dedicated to konami but

01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:45.420
the other half is all for pump it up and everything to do with pump it up

01:31:45.420 --> 01:31:49.300
and so when i heard this i'd wanted to cry

01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:52.740
the half of me that loves pump it up could stay out of the konami versus rock

01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:53.860
sore debate

01:31:53.860 --> 01:31:57.340
and it could just go play pump it up but now it has to uh...

01:31:57.340 --> 01:32:01.060
get involved because apparently and amira wanted to

01:32:01.060 --> 01:32:06.180
get sued again by konami or vice versa or however that crappy lawsuit went

01:32:06.180 --> 01:32:07.320
but um...

01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:08.740
yeah i don't like it

01:32:08.740 --> 01:32:13.960
and i've even tried pump recently or not pump uh... in the group recently and

01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:16.580
and still very angry about all this

01:32:16.580 --> 01:32:18.540
i played in the group today

01:32:18.540 --> 01:32:20.520
so that i had a uh...

01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:21.060
it's

01:32:21.060 --> 01:32:22.900
uh...

01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:24.620
well

01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:26.300
oh yeah that was funny cuz

01:32:26.300 --> 01:32:30.140
on my first song i got a i got a star because i got like a ninety six percent

01:32:30.140 --> 01:32:35.140
or something and see yourself, you got a star! You can get a star in this game!

01:32:35.140 --> 01:32:37.140
And I'm like, dude, they let you work on DDR?

01:32:37.140 --> 01:32:40.140
My DDR skills have seriously declined.

01:32:40.140 --> 01:32:44.140
But no, I think that's good. That goes to show that you don't have to be a DDR expert

01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:49.140
or whatever to play, you know, you don't have to be able to AAA everything in order to work on DDR.

01:32:49.140 --> 01:32:52.140
I haven't really played DDR, like, for real in years.

01:32:52.140 --> 01:32:59.140
So, it's amazing that I even got an A- or an S- or whatever that crappy letter thing they had on In the Groove was.

01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:03.460
Yeah, I'm just very bitter about this whole thing, and I don't want Pump It Up's name

01:33:03.460 --> 01:33:08.140
attached to In The Groove, because I like Pump It Up, and I don't like In The Groove.

01:33:08.140 --> 01:33:14.420
But I like In The Groove's songs, Land of the Rising Sun is cool, and The Roots, that's

01:33:14.420 --> 01:33:15.420
about it.

01:33:15.420 --> 01:33:16.420
Yes, Loki.

01:33:16.420 --> 01:33:17.420
Be good.

01:33:17.420 --> 01:33:23.420
Why in the hell would Andamiro want to like, shame themselves, you know, by putting Pump

01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:25.140
It Up in front of this game?

01:33:25.140 --> 01:33:30.140
I mean, honestly, unless, unless, you know, the whole creative team behind Pump It Up

01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:34.460
went and redesigned their whole interface and said, okay, yeah, we like what you did,

01:33:34.460 --> 01:33:35.460
but we got a few...

01:33:35.460 --> 01:33:36.460
No, no, no, no.

01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:38.380
Say what you wrote about the In The Groove interface.

01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:40.420
Pumps is way worse.

01:33:40.420 --> 01:33:42.420
Pump has one of the worst interfaces in the world.

01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:43.500
That is a lie.

01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:44.500
That is a total truth.

01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:45.500
That is a lie.

01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:46.500
That is a total truth.

01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:47.500
Pump It Up has it great.

01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:48.500
I speak the truth.

01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:49.500
They have the songs...

01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:50.500
Get over it.

01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:52.660
They have the songs classified by channels, the Banya channel, the K-pop channel, and

01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:53.660
the pop channel.

01:33:53.660 --> 01:33:54.860
You don't get much easier than that.

01:33:54.860 --> 01:33:58.840
The only thing wrong with it is that you have to put all the codes in via your foot, and

01:33:58.840 --> 01:33:59.840
that gets annoying.

01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:06.300
But also, when you're talking about In the Groove 2 having the codes with the feet to

01:34:06.300 --> 01:34:11.260
unlock the songs, Pump It Up does that too, so that's no surprise.

01:34:11.260 --> 01:34:14.700
Which interface looks like it came out of my ass, and which one looks like it was actually

01:34:14.700 --> 01:34:16.940
worked on by professional software teams?

01:34:16.940 --> 01:34:18.020
I would beg to differ.

01:34:18.020 --> 01:34:20.100
I cannot stand Pump It Up's interface.

01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:21.100
I hate it.

01:34:21.100 --> 01:34:22.100
It's horrible.

01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:23.100
Okay, okay.

01:34:23.100 --> 01:34:24.780
Interface technicalities aside, I'm not talking about the

01:34:24.780 --> 01:34:28.660
way the interface functions, just pure aesthetic value of it.

01:34:28.660 --> 01:34:33.100
I want you to say, which game has run to you in it? Because that sells me right there,

01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:34.780
that's enough. Pump It Up doesn't anymore.

01:34:34.780 --> 01:34:39.900
Oh, that's true. Damn them, neither. DarkStalker, you've been off very quiet over there, what

01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:44.460
do you think about this whole debacle? I'm not going to give any of them my business,

01:34:44.460 --> 01:34:48.900
so that's all there is to it. I thought you liked Pump It Up.

01:34:48.900 --> 01:34:51.060
I liked it before they followed their name.

01:34:51.060 --> 01:34:52.540
Ooh!

01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:56.140
Oh, snap! I think that kind of gives her opinion right there.

01:34:56.140 --> 01:35:00.180
This would be like, you know, putting, you know, Dance Dance Revolution's George Foreman

01:35:00.180 --> 01:35:03.740
Grill. I mean, there's really no point in doing that.

01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:05.660
Now,

01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:09.500
hold on a minute, because I'm actually going to think this out here, okay? Just be careful, there might

01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:11.500
be steam that arises from my head or something.

01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:13.260
Now, let's see.

01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:15.660
I have a dancing game.

01:35:15.660 --> 01:35:17.420
I'm Andy Mero, and I have a dancing game.

01:35:17.420 --> 01:35:20.700
And it's not catching on the same way that my competitor's

01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:22.860
dancing game is catching on.

01:35:22.860 --> 01:35:25.520
OK, now wait for a minute.

01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:30.140
I am another company who borrowed heavily a lot of

01:35:30.140 --> 01:35:33.060
ideas from the competitor and put it into its own game and

01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:34.540
tried to improve upon it.

01:35:34.540 --> 01:35:35.820
And now I'm getting sued.

01:35:35.820 --> 01:35:36.940
So here we are.

01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:39.780
We've got the number one, the king of dance games, Konami.

01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:40.680
You can't dispute that.

01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:42.300
Konami sells the most.

01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:42.900
You got that.

01:35:42.900 --> 01:35:45.020
Just argue why you want the quality of the games.

01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:47.420
but in terms of sales, Konami is tops.

01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:52.080
So number two and number three want to join forces

01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:54.340
to take out number one.

01:35:54.340 --> 01:35:59.220
Where's the, where's the, that doesn't make sense in that

01:35:59.220 --> 01:36:00.380
because it makes total sense to me.

01:36:00.380 --> 01:36:01.700
It's war.

01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:03.140
Yeah, it's number two and number three.

01:36:03.140 --> 01:36:04.540
Ever play Risk?

01:36:04.540 --> 01:36:05.380
Yeah.

01:36:07.180 --> 01:36:08.860
Number two and number three are joining forces

01:36:08.860 --> 01:36:10.220
to take out number one.

01:36:10.220 --> 01:36:15.740
just like GameStop and EB merged to take out Walmart, right?

01:36:15.740 --> 01:36:18.180
The thing is, though, this is only the arcade aspect.

01:36:18.180 --> 01:36:22.660
I have not seen numbers on how well The Groove has sold on the PS2.

01:36:22.660 --> 01:36:25.460
DDR still sells really well.

01:36:25.460 --> 01:36:28.900
Pump It Up still hasn't come out here yet, so we can't judge that.

01:36:28.900 --> 01:36:32.420
So they might fight for the dying arcade market,

01:36:32.420 --> 01:36:35.460
but who's to say that this collaboration will have

01:36:35.460 --> 01:36:37.860
any impact on the home version?

01:36:37.860 --> 01:36:39.100
OK, good point.

01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:46.100
I can put fifty additional names in front of this goddamn game and it's still not going to make it one ounce better.

01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:48.100
Just a big ball of hate, Loki.

01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:50.100
Big ball of hate.

01:36:50.100 --> 01:36:51.100
Alright.

01:36:51.100 --> 01:36:54.100
In this case, it's a little deserved.

01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:57.100
Alright, you guys.

01:36:57.100 --> 01:37:00.100
This is why we lost all the listeners, because they were listening in the-

01:37:00.100 --> 01:37:03.100
Hey, listen, listen, if they make a good game, I'll give it, you know, good reviews.

01:37:03.100 --> 01:37:06.100
But if the game sucks, I'm going to tell you how it is.

01:37:06.100 --> 01:37:11.620
wait a minute wait a minute hello to the game's credit you haven't played pump it

01:37:11.620 --> 01:37:16.780
up in the group to yet correct so you don't know yet are you gonna give it at

01:37:16.780 --> 01:37:23.020
least one playthrough I'll play it once once just to give it get a taste of how

01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:29.600
crappy it is and then I'll just let you know how it is again but you have to go

01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:34.260
in there with an impartial view as the media let's go this way

01:37:34.260 --> 01:37:39.740
I I I don't think your play to play as I've seen how it started off is really

01:37:39.740 --> 01:37:40.640
shitty

01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:45.220
it should be pretty easy to impress me then it's gotta be better than crap

01:37:45.220 --> 01:37:48.520
okay so that it has a pretty easy goal to hit

01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:49.940
if they can't do that

01:37:49.940 --> 01:37:54.860
I'm sorry the media you need to be impartial like Fox News channel

01:37:54.860 --> 01:37:56.820
Snicker snicker snort

01:37:56.820 --> 01:38:00.820
Yeah, only those dirty republicans play in the group too, okay?

01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:06.820
Is that better? Is that impartial?

01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:10.820
I don't know what to tell you anymore, Loki. I just don't...

01:38:12.820 --> 01:38:13.820
Alright.

01:38:17.820 --> 01:38:20.820
They can have their pump-it-up. I have macadamia nuts. Everyone's happy.

01:38:21.820 --> 01:38:24.820
I hope this doesn't last. I want them to split up really bad.

01:38:24.820 --> 01:38:29.700
really bad. You want them to argue and fight about this? Yeah, I want Anamir to realize

01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:36.700
their wrongs and punch Roxor in the face and take all their money, all four dollars.

01:38:37.100 --> 01:38:44.100
I think the new cabinets are interesting. I think they're kind of ugly, but I think

01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:50.860
they're interesting because they're really big and I like big things, so I'm kind of

01:38:50.860 --> 01:38:54.540
curious to see more so interesting it's like putting a DDR pad on a pump it up

01:38:54.540 --> 01:39:00.820
cabinet oh wait that's what it is well that's that forget let's go how are we

01:39:00.820 --> 01:39:06.340
gonna make this for panel with the pump it up Kevin oh I got it there we go

01:39:06.340 --> 01:39:11.180
that was easy and this way now they can get around selling those boxers because

01:39:11.180 --> 01:39:13.940
you can just put it in a pump cabinet and replace the pad well yeah they're

01:39:13.940 --> 01:39:18.740
not gonna get sued over this one unless well Adam Eros smart and then realizes

01:39:18.740 --> 01:39:24.480
are so horrible for doing this and decides to drop the name and then sue them for putting

01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:27.500
stuff in their arcade machines. I hate RockSore.

01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:37.720
Alright, whatever. Moving on. I'm in the groove, fans. I tried to argue your case here, but

01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:44.260
Loki just won't budge. One bit. I'm sorry, guys. What can I say? Alright, let's go on

01:39:44.260 --> 01:39:46.260
Let's get into tonight's cage match, shall we?

01:39:48.260 --> 01:39:49.260
Okay, we don't have to.

01:39:50.260 --> 01:39:52.260
I was nodding, but no one heard it on the radio.

01:39:52.260 --> 01:39:53.260
Sorry, alright.

01:39:56.260 --> 01:40:00.260
The way the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match works, we play three songs for you guys.

01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:02.260
One that each host selects.

01:40:02.260 --> 01:40:10.260
And the winning song, as voted by you guys, goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Video Game Music and More program,

01:40:10.260 --> 01:40:13.260
which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on the station when we are not live.

01:40:13.260 --> 01:40:18.980
So, you get to hear a clip of last week's song and two new songs in their entirety.

01:40:18.980 --> 01:40:23.100
So let's hear first, the song that won last week.

01:40:23.100 --> 01:40:31.500
It's a clip, it's a remix by Loki, and it's Echo Image, remix by Loki, Skulk, the Misunderstood

01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:33.100
Mix is what it was called, I believe.

01:40:33.100 --> 01:40:35.540
I don't remember, I just renamed it again, so whatever.

01:40:35.540 --> 01:40:38.540
Well I think MP3 says Misunderstood Mix, so that's what we're gonna call it.

01:40:38.540 --> 01:40:40.300
So here it is, a clip of song number one.

01:40:40.300 --> 01:40:45.660
remember you have to be in our chat room www.orensonsradio.com click on chat to vote and be a part of the cage

01:40:45.660 --> 01:40:50.200
match all right here it is song number one echo or echo image remix by Loki

01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:57.200
Skulk, the misunderstood mix.

01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:39.060
I've lost the fragment of my soul

01:41:39.060 --> 01:41:43.560
Take me in, that's what I've become

01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:47.060
I'm falling like I'm a fish

01:41:47.060 --> 01:41:50.560
Make me take control of the world

01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:53.560
Make no excuses, I'm shit

01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:57.560
Take me in, that's what I've become

01:41:57.560 --> 01:42:00.560
I know I've made it to the top of the street

01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:48.240
Alright, that was song number one, Echo Image remix by Loki Skulk, the misunderstood mix.

01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:50.760
That was the song you guys voted as the winner last week.

01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:55.840
Let's see if it can hang on two weeks in a row or if it gets dethroned by one of the

01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:57.560
new entries in tonight's cage match.

01:42:57.560 --> 01:42:58.560
I think I'll start tonight.

01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:00.560
Dark Sakura, you can bring up the rear.

01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:04.560
Wait, that's supposed to...okay.

01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:06.560
Yeah, hahaha, I get it.

01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:08.560
Ha ha ha, I get it.

01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:15.560
My choice tonight, I liked that I Am Gothic song so much last week that I had to dig up some more songs by Spray.

01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:17.560
And I really like this song.

01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:20.560
And Dark Sakura, I know you're going to like this one. You have to.

01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:22.560
Do I have to?

01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:23.560
You have to.

01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:26.560
Because this is a song called I Kill With My Car.

01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:32.560
I like it already. Alright, let's hear it. Song number two in tonight's cage match, Spray with I Kill With My Car.

01:43:56.560 --> 01:44:06.560
Cold chrome heartbeat, stainless steel Come on baby, take that step

01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:09.560
In front of me in death and death

01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:29.560
I can't live without, I can't live without

01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:39.560
Feet are the rattles, I start to sweat Girl machine, it's harmonic death

01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:48.560
Abandoned system, terribly Hear my baby hug me

01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:57.560
Hurling pension and thunder Grinding pension can't stop

01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:02.560
I kill with my gun

01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:07.560
I kill with my gun

01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:12.560
I kill with my gun

01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:17.560
I kill with my gun

01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:20.560
It's a sexual brand

01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:23.560
Like power hide and release control

01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:28.060
It's an accuracy which keeps the fear away and on the road

01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:32.560
It's an accuracy to meet this scenario

01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:37.560
If the sky is in the falls, I'm here alone

01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:42.060
Rubber on tarmac, grip the ground

01:45:42.060 --> 01:45:47.060
Melting heartbeat, the firing crowd

01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:51.560
Come on baby, clutch control

01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:55.560
It's in their senses to see that you're the best

01:45:56.560 --> 01:46:01.560
I kill with my gun

01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:05.560
I kill with my gun

01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:10.560
I kill with my gun

01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:15.560
I kill with my gun

01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:53.840
Number two I kill with my car. What do you think dark Sakura? I I can't pull

01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:58.960
a Simon tonight I'm sorry. It gets to nine and a half just because there was a

01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:02.520
bit of repetition but it was pretty cool and you have to email that to me now. Oh

01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:08.800
my god she liked one of my songs. It wasn't crap trance! Every week it's like let's

01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:10.800
Let's fix something really poppy for...

01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:12.800
I like a lot of crap trance.

01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:14.800
Or crap trance? Or...

01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:16.800
Or less than crap trance?

01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:18.800
Or... Or...

01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:20.800
Or, uh, what's your face?

01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:22.800
Kelly Osbourne.

01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:24.800
Which is just crap, period.

01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:26.800
Alright, let's just see if I went over Logi.

01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:28.800
You know what?

01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:30.800
I'm sorry, it's gonna get a 5

01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:32.800
because it wasn't crap trance.

01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:34.800
You know, I was really expecting crap trance

01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:36.800
and this was not crap trance.

01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:39.120
So, it gets a five. That and the fat.

01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:42.960
Fuck you both! Fuck you both! That's all I have to say. Fuck you both.

01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:51.120
Teager. Ten. Spray. I like them.

01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:53.440
X to fur. What do you think?

01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:56.320
I give it a ten, too.

01:47:57.360 --> 01:48:00.720
Alright. Alright, let's get into song number three.

01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:05.920
Remember, it's not our votes to count. It's yours in the chat room at www.orangesontrader.com.

01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:10.640
But you got one more song to pick from and it's dark soccer is would you pick five years ago?

01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:13.560
I was on a rampage looking for dr. Bombay stuff

01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:19.000
Instead I downloaded a song which to my delight was by somebody that I you know really liked

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:23.100
I downloaded a song by del the funky homosapien called. Dr. Bombay

01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:27.080
And I like to think so cuz those cool

01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:34.480
So and of course this I didn't even realize until after I picked the song and already email is like Oh gorillas connection, but oh

01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:43.480
The song is called, Del The Funky Homosapien.

01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:49.880
All right here it is song number three tell the funky homo sapien dr. Bombay not related to the 2dx artist dr.

01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:51.880
Right, all right here we go

01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:23.880
Well, kick it, mutton tail, sing me a 40 as a lie-bar when I'm through

01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:27.880
You don't like it? Well, you got the kiss, where the sun don't shine

01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:30.880
Bumpin' like my behind, I lose the band but I'ma be fine

01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:35.880
Stop the feelin', think I still could make funk real good

01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:38.880
Take it then I lose it, make you say it

01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:42.880
The more the booty make you shake your rump

01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:44.880
Till the brand new feet bump

01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:49.880
a chunk cause I'm much like a hoe cause you don't get killed with fuckin' a chunk

01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:53.880
Comin' from around the way, it's self added on as I survive time

01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:57.880
Just serve something, eat on something, eat on plate

01:49:57.880 --> 01:50:00.880
Every time I try to get to me, it's always burnin' away

01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:06.880
Just serve something, what you find on it? What you say?

01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:10.880
What the fuck is guaranteed to make my day?

01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:12.880
So, so, so, so

01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:14.880
I'm as much as a black woman through the inspection

01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:16.880
And the question everybody is asking

01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:18.880
When you get your foot down

01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:20.880
A brother named George, it's the one fifty month old

01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:22.880
Let's take it to the stage, you suckers

01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:25.880
I jam, and Mr. Domenino eats much

01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:28.880
Back in the house with the two-how at Lindsey

01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:30.880
Now you know every day is terrific

01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:33.880
Drunk in the 1990s, jacked ironic

01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:35.880
The grass, we was back at X-Tronic

01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:37.880
Down with the links, mine straight from the ghetto

01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:39.880
But I'm under the sun in the meadow

01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:41.880
Me and this Amazon sitting on my lap

01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:45.180
Sittin' on my lap, she bust so big when she walkin' clackin'

01:50:45.180 --> 01:50:48.380
Doin' the hoochie coochie and the four shawls know who I am

01:50:48.380 --> 01:50:49.880
So girl sing the chorus

Dr. Bumpin', he don't stop and he don't play

01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:57.080
Every time I try to get to me, he's always runnin' away

01:50:57.080 --> 01:50:59.280
He's runnin' away, he's runnin' away

01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:03.480
Dr. Bumpin', got your body runnin', what you say?

01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:06.480
When the funk is guaranteed to make my day

01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:15.480
Doctor Bombay, hit on stuff and hit on play Every time I try to catch him he's always running away

01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:26.480
Doctor Bombay, Doctor Bombay

01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:31.480
Watch the watch, cause if your style's tall Your style's gonna damn sure make your house tall

01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:36.480
You peed on my jaws on your fists, I'm a dog, so you might be wrong

01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:40.480
Wait, it ain't fool to jock, cause you're real far from a ballerina

01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:45.480
So, ooh, ooh, Mr. Dop-a-mina, freeze, and get up off your knees

01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:50.480
Everything that Dr. Bump makes sex, is guaranteed to make you say

01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:54.480
So keep some side to head, I like clubmen hanging out with the dibs

01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:59.480
And girl, if you ain't got a chair, I won't hesitate to pull out my funky lines

01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:01.480
But if you ain't down, what's your fault?

01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:04.480

01:52:13.480 --> 01:52:15.480
Dr. Rhombus

01:52:15.480 --> 01:52:17.480
Get on something, get on a plane

01:52:17.480 --> 01:52:19.480
Every time I'm trying to get you in

01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:21.480
It's always running away from you

01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:22.480
Please get a good man

01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:24.480
Dr. Rhombus

01:53:24.480 --> 01:53:38.160
Okay, that was Del the Funky Homo Sapien with Dr. Bombay.

01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:41.320
Let's see if the doctor is in or out permanently.

01:53:41.320 --> 01:53:42.840
Dark Sakura.

01:53:42.840 --> 01:53:49.240
I could have been better, but I've been listening to this song a lot today, so it gets a 9.

01:53:49.240 --> 01:53:51.240
Alright, uh, Logie.

01:53:51.240 --> 01:53:53.240
It gets a 9 too.

01:53:53.240 --> 01:53:54.240
It's pretty cool.

01:53:54.240 --> 01:53:55.240
But it wasn't trans.

01:53:55.240 --> 01:53:56.240
You're an ass.

01:53:56.240 --> 01:53:57.240
I thought he doesn't expect trans from me.

01:53:57.240 --> 01:53:58.240
You're an ass.

01:53:58.240 --> 01:53:59.240
Right?

01:53:59.240 --> 01:54:00.240
You're an ass.

01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:01.240
He doesn't expect trans from me.

01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:02.240
Ass.

01:54:02.240 --> 01:54:03.240
Seagurd.

01:54:03.240 --> 01:54:07.720
It made me think of Busta Move and Ham.

01:54:07.720 --> 01:54:14.000
So if he were in another game, he would have had that as a theme song, so it gets an 8.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:20.440
That gets a resounding WTFF from me, but it was actually kind of funky, it was like what

01:54:20.440 --> 01:54:23.520
the funky fuck, so it wasn't bad.

01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:27.400
I think they should have music like that in DDR.

01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:33.000
They need to mix that in. I completely agree. They need to mix the goth music up and stuff like that.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:34.340
Make a suggestion.

01:54:34.340 --> 01:54:37.580
Tell the funky homo-sapien.

01:54:37.580 --> 01:54:42.140
Yeah, can you write that on the next scantron that goes and makes the DDR games?

01:54:42.140 --> 01:54:43.940
That would be great.

01:54:43.940 --> 01:54:48.060
Oh, my score. I guess I give it a, I don't know, like a seven and a half.

01:54:48.060 --> 01:54:51.260
It was Nito. X to Purr, do you want to give a score on that one?

01:54:51.260 --> 01:54:53.580
tell the funky homo sapien

01:54:53.580 --> 01:54:56.420
i think i would give it a nine

01:54:56.420 --> 01:54:58.340
all right because i really enjoyed it

01:54:58.340 --> 01:55:00.100
when you moved?

01:55:00.100 --> 01:55:03.020
yes i did

01:55:03.020 --> 01:55:07.300
all right remember it our scores don't count but yours do it's about time to

01:55:07.300 --> 01:55:11.100
vote but first let's recap your choices song number one tonight echo image

01:55:11.100 --> 01:55:18.100
remixed by loki skulk misunderstood

01:55:21.780 --> 01:55:28.780
song number two you can vote for tonight is spray with I kill with my car

01:55:35.820 --> 01:55:39.740
and song number three you can vote for tonight del the funky homo sapien

01:55:39.740 --> 01:55:40.740

01:55:40.740 --> 01:55:41.740
Please vote now.

01:55:41.740 --> 01:55:56.740
Send a private message to Skye in the chat room with your vote, and we'll announce the

01:55:56.740 --> 01:56:01.580
winner in a few moments here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:56:01.580 --> 01:56:02.940
What are you kids talking about back there?

01:56:02.940 --> 01:56:06.740
I was saying that I found a whole bunch of CDs that I hope aren't warped, so I was going

01:56:06.740 --> 01:56:10.400
and try to burn myself a new car CD and that was gonna go on it so instead of

01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:18.400
being all eurobeat driving in my Lancer I'll be all side to side you know what

01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:22.880
what I'm listening to that song and if I was driving and listening to this song I

01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:32.920
think I would be like check and turn a signal to the left a signal to the right

01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:36.920
Props to you if you get that reference, by the way.

01:56:36.920 --> 01:56:40.920
How can you not get that reference? You're an idiot if you don't get that reference.

01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:44.920
I hope that folks in the chatroom get that. But seriously, that's what it sounds

01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:48.920
like to me. DarkSakura, when you do that, and you

01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:52.920
ride in the car, tell me that your mind will not do that. Do that check

01:56:52.920 --> 01:56:56.920
and turn. This is the left. Now it was step on the right.

01:56:56.920 --> 01:57:00.920
I'm just gonna be all like, I'll be like, shit yeah, it's Del.

01:57:00.920 --> 01:57:05.760
Um, this is the part of the show where we usually ask our buddy, Loki, what's going

01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:09.320
on in the Sims scene, because Lord knows I don't follow it.

01:57:09.320 --> 01:57:10.320
Loki!

01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:14.280
Well, I told you earlier what exactly happened, and the main thing that happened this week

01:57:14.280 --> 01:57:20.440
was that the In the Groove theme is released for StepMania, and that is it.

01:57:20.440 --> 01:57:23.240
No new Max 300 remixes of notes?

01:57:23.240 --> 01:57:24.240
No.

01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:25.240
Alright.

01:57:25.240 --> 01:57:30.880
So, one thing I do want to ask you about then, since there's not a lot going on in the Sims

01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:34.880
I kind of want to, this kind of blurs the line here, this isn't necessarily DDR related,

01:57:34.880 --> 01:57:37.880
but we get to talk about other games when we want to on the show as well.

01:57:37.880 --> 01:57:40.880
What is up with the PSP homebrew stuff?

01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:45.880
I know it was released this week, how does it work? Is it good? Tell us about it.

01:57:45.880 --> 01:57:47.880
Put down warriorware for a minute, tell us about it.

01:57:47.880 --> 01:57:50.880
Damn you, hit the pause button. Thank you.

01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:56.880
Ugh, fine. Anyways, the whole thing with the homebrew stuff,

01:57:56.880 --> 01:58:03.520
homebrew stuff. Basically, they found a workaround to get, you know, games to work on version

01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:10.620
1.5 PSPs. And for those who don't know, the version 1.0 PSPs were the very first PSP shipped

01:58:10.620 --> 01:58:15.520
in Japan. And those had a hole in it in their encryption or whatever that allowed you to

01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:21.800
run your own homebrew code on PSPs. Well, they fixed that in the U.S. ones which are

01:58:21.800 --> 01:58:27.400
now version 1.5 where you couldn't do that. So, the way they've gotten around it is they

01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:33.560
have almost like a swap technique. It's like, you know, the old PlayStation swap thing where

01:58:33.560 --> 01:58:38.840
you put in one disk and you swap it with another and you basically trick it into thinking that

01:58:38.840 --> 01:58:45.360
it's one thing when it's not. So, what we did is you actually take a memory card with

01:58:45.360 --> 01:58:51.360
an image of a file on it and you put it in, load the game and while it's loading, you

01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:56.420
really quickly swap in the other memory card so it thinks it's loading something else.

01:58:56.420 --> 01:59:03.700
And then that in turn allows your game to run. And so now what they have available for

01:59:03.700 --> 01:59:09.340
is like all the mainstream emulators out there so you can emulate, you know, Nintendo and

01:59:09.340 --> 01:59:13.380
the Super Nintendo, Genesis, Mega Drive, you know.

01:59:13.380 --> 01:59:17.700
Why is it so easy to port all these emulators over the PSP? Is it because the PSP is like

01:59:17.700 --> 01:59:18.900
a mini PC or something?

01:59:18.900 --> 01:59:38.900
No, it's just run off of, you basically adapt your code to whatever processor it is, and I forget what kind it is, but it's basically, just like, you know, the difference between the Nintendo DS and the Game Boy Advance, it's just ARM 9 and ARM 7. They're really almost the same processor, so you only have to change your code a little bit.

01:59:38.900 --> 01:59:43.080
It's like kind of programming in, say, C versus C++ or

01:59:43.080 --> 01:59:44.320
Visual C++.

01:59:44.320 --> 01:59:47.080
There's a few different ways you program stuff.

01:59:47.080 --> 01:59:49.680
And so you have to program it differently for that.

01:59:49.680 --> 01:59:51.280
And so it's easy to port it over.

01:59:51.280 --> 01:59:53.680
Well, now, obviously, this process doesn't take much time

01:59:53.680 --> 01:59:57.160
because I was looking at the emulators.

01:59:57.160 --> 02:00:02.040
Now, they just were able to get this fix in for America.

02:00:02.040 --> 02:00:03.480
And I thought a lot of these programs

02:00:03.480 --> 02:00:04.600
kind of originated here.

02:00:04.600 --> 02:00:07.600
So I was kind of surprised with how fast emulators were

02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:07.800
happening.

02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:12.280
Well the emulators also too, you're getting homebrew games in there too, like for example

02:00:12.280 --> 02:00:17.260
this game called Beats of Rage, which is a Streets of Rage clone, that's in there, Doom,

02:00:17.260 --> 02:00:21.700
they ported Doom over, and anything that runs off of WAD, so you have Doom, Heretic, Doom

02:00:21.700 --> 02:00:27.120
2, and I've even seen some, I don't know what exactly it is, like Quake and Duke Nukem

02:00:27.120 --> 02:00:34.840
3D, but I think those are just conversions or mods of Doom or something, but those are

02:00:34.840 --> 02:00:38.620
available and then you see actually people making like basic programs like chess and

02:00:38.620 --> 02:00:46.180
tic-tac-toe and whatnot, those are available and pretty much, you know, this is just going

02:00:46.180 --> 02:00:51.700
to keep going, you know, and they've found a way, supposedly now, Sony's like, oh yeah,

02:00:51.700 --> 02:00:55.980
well we're going to try to make you upgrade again so this hole's closed so you can't do

02:00:55.980 --> 02:00:56.980
this.

02:00:56.980 --> 02:00:59.540
But, you know, it's just something fun to do while you're waiting for more games to

02:00:59.540 --> 02:01:02.620
come out for the PSP, it's really what it comes down to.

02:01:02.620 --> 02:01:06.120
very in a how would they close the whole of what they would be force your

02:01:06.120 --> 02:01:09.740
firmware to upgrade yet with the new game basically a new game would come out

02:01:09.740 --> 02:01:12.960
they would have the firmware update software on their in or the game the run

02:01:12.960 --> 02:01:16.680
it update your firmware to like one five two or something

02:01:16.680 --> 02:01:18.200
anyway for she do that

02:01:18.200 --> 02:01:21.360
is there a game out there that does that now of their japanese games to do that

02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:22.600
uh... okay

02:01:22.600 --> 02:01:24.040
uh... but they really should be jack

02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:27.600
himself on the planet but you have both a like grand theft auto

02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:30.880
will probably have something that i'd be screwed i would be tough if that

02:01:30.880 --> 02:01:33.880
that's the case, because then they'd be like, ah, dammit.

02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:35.920
And they probably would do it with a game like that, because

02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:37.000
everyone's going to buy that game.

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:40.440
Now, my next question is, like we said earlier, when a

02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:44.680
website or a game company says, you will not be able to

02:01:44.680 --> 02:01:45.920
decrypt our encryption.

02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:48.360
That is just an invite for hackers to hack it.

02:01:48.360 --> 02:01:52.080
So what's to say that 1.5.2 won't be cracked soon enough?

02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:53.280
It just might.

02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:56.840
Or what they might do is get away to where it doesn't

02:01:56.840 --> 02:01:58.840
matter what firmware you update it to.

02:01:58.840 --> 02:02:02.440
it's not going to... it'll bypass the whole encryption thing all together.

02:02:02.440 --> 02:02:07.120
Basically just a workaround for it. It's possible because, like, for example,

02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:12.200
earlier this week supposedly leaked on the internet was their entire library

02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:15.960
for all the library files for

02:02:15.960 --> 02:02:21.880
the PSP development kit. So, if you get a hold of that, you're going to see how everything works

02:02:21.880 --> 02:02:24.900
and it won't matter how many times you upgrade the firmware. They're just going to have a way

02:02:24.900 --> 02:02:25.480
around it

02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:30.160
where it'll think it's like a version whatever. It'll think it's a UMD or something.

02:02:30.160 --> 02:02:34.420
We'll just get away around it. In my opinion, this kind of sells PSPs. I kind of want one

02:02:34.420 --> 02:02:37.320
even more now, knowing I can play Legend of Zelda on it.

02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:40.760
They don't understand that, you know, I mean, granted, it's, you know,

02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:44.000
they should just allow it to run homebrew code, but I don't think they want to be

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:48.000
responsible for, like, this kind of stuff. For any of this kind of stuff, so they have to, you know,

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:49.520
actively try to,

02:02:49.520 --> 02:02:54.120
you know, upgrade, you know, the firmware. What I would do is just say, well, we have it up,

02:02:54.120 --> 02:02:58.080
you know the firmware can be you know the upgrade can be downloaded and it

02:02:58.080 --> 02:03:00.840
fixes this problem leave it at that and just let you know

02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:04.720
because I noticed that the DS isn't doing anything like that

02:03:04.720 --> 02:03:07.520
then you're going to have Linux on there and then you're going to be able to run pretty much anything

02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:11.960
well almost anything on there. But isn't it harder to get something on the DS because the

02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:14.560
DS doesn't have that whole memory stick thing

02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:18.160
Granted it has the flash cards. Yeah the flash cards are the

02:03:18.160 --> 02:03:22.400
way you do that. But I think what they're doing right now with

02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:27.480
The PSP, though, is they've got, um, well, some of the things I thought were pretty cool

02:03:27.480 --> 02:03:31.400
is you can actually overclock your PC in some of these games, because it is running.

02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:37.680
The chip's supposed to run at 333 megahertz, but it actually runs at 222, so some of these

02:03:37.680 --> 02:03:42.260
emulators, they actually have it where you can overclock it to 333, so, you know, it

02:03:42.260 --> 02:03:47.160
runs at what it's supposed to, and so, so, it's just interesting to see what you can

02:03:47.160 --> 02:03:48.160
do with this.

02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:51.140
And, Beats of Rage is awesome, because it has so many different mods to it, so you can

02:03:51.140 --> 02:03:55.020
play like you know it's basically a final fight so you can do it with

02:03:55.020 --> 02:03:58.820
whatever characters you want like Megaman or ghosts and goblins I've seen

02:03:58.820 --> 02:04:03.420
some really strange mods out there kill bill someone's made a mod for that you

02:04:03.420 --> 02:04:09.020
know so it's interesting interesting hmm all I know is that when I saw Legend of

02:04:09.020 --> 02:04:12.500
Zelda being played the the first thing and I know a secret thought of this was

02:04:12.500 --> 02:04:17.140
that oh my gosh we could play Kid Icarus on the PSP and that makes the PSP just

02:04:17.140 --> 02:04:19.620
totally worth having and I was just thinking about that too and I was just

02:04:19.620 --> 02:04:29.580
kind of fantasizing tell me this doesn't make you happy damn you Nintendo damn

02:04:29.580 --> 02:04:33.540
you and then over not putting it's gonna I can tell you pretty much it's gonna be

02:04:33.540 --> 02:04:39.820
in goddamn Animal Crossing DS it's gonna be better be better be I want the new I

02:04:39.820 --> 02:04:44.260
want a new kid of Chris though and no 3d crap I want like a I just remember the

02:04:44.260 --> 02:04:47.980
What was that comic?

02:04:47.980 --> 02:04:53.820
They don't do it anymore, but it was sort of like 8-bit theater.

02:04:53.820 --> 02:04:57.660
They had Mario and all the guys hanging out at the bar, and no one's talking about their

02:04:57.660 --> 02:05:01.660
upgrades and Pip's like, hey, I want one!

02:05:01.660 --> 02:05:04.100
Sorry, you don't get one.

02:05:04.100 --> 02:05:09.940
I remember Miyamoto saying something at E3 about he wants to put Kid Icarus on the revolution

02:05:09.940 --> 02:05:10.940
like a new one.

02:05:10.940 --> 02:05:11.940
He's a good cop.

02:05:11.940 --> 02:05:13.940
He's what he is, honestly.

02:05:13.940 --> 02:05:20.940
I'll take a tactics game or first-person shooter with pit, but as long as I get a Kid Icarus game

02:05:20.940 --> 02:05:26.060
That's what I know. I will not accept any of that crap. I want a good old

02:05:26.780 --> 02:05:28.300
2d

02:05:28.300 --> 02:05:33.820
Shooter with three like like beautiful to Joe ish that just now with that cell cell cells

02:05:34.420 --> 02:05:36.420
cell shading stuff

02:05:36.420 --> 02:05:42.220
But imagine looking through pits eyes while you're pulling back the arrow to shoot. No, I'm a wizard in his one

02:05:42.220 --> 02:05:43.220
And I...

02:05:43.220 --> 02:05:44.220
It would just be Metroid!

02:05:44.220 --> 02:05:46.460
I don't care if they did a good job with it.

02:05:46.460 --> 02:05:53.460
And I'm not even like the biggest Metroid Prime fan, I mean it's okay, I like it okay.

02:05:53.460 --> 02:05:57.140
But of course people would just say that that's because I have this intense hatred for first

02:05:57.140 --> 02:05:59.000
person shooters, which you know, whatever.

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:00.500
Which is why you own Halo 1 and 2.

02:06:00.500 --> 02:06:05.220
Yeah, which is why I own Halo 1 and 2.

02:06:05.220 --> 02:06:11.900
Alright, um, let's find out who won tonight's cage match, shall we?

02:06:11.900 --> 02:06:21.720
cage match the winner is you guys ready for this it is a tie tonight and it's

02:06:21.720 --> 02:06:29.600
our favorite kind of tie boys it's a three-way tie tonight so we got to go

02:06:29.600 --> 02:06:34.840
look at the Orange Lounge Radio rule book and let's see here oh yes I

02:06:34.840 --> 02:06:38.840
believe the way a three-way tie works for the Orange Lounge Radio cage match

02:06:38.840 --> 02:06:46.700
rules is that the song that won last week is automatically tossed and the

02:06:46.700 --> 02:06:51.580
host who put that song in breaks the tie from the other two so Loki your song

02:06:51.580 --> 02:06:55.760
gets tossed actually you're wrong it's actually the person that's a guest in

02:06:55.760 --> 02:06:59.380
the studio gets to pick no no I know I'm right on this one I know I'm right on

02:06:59.380 --> 02:07:06.580
this one I got a sedan grader you got to break a tie what's it gonna be is it

02:07:06.580 --> 02:07:09.860
going to be Spray, I Kill With My Car, or Del The Funky

02:07:09.860 --> 02:07:11.780
Homo Sapien with Dr. Bombay.

02:07:11.780 --> 02:07:12.780
Dr. Bombay.

02:07:12.780 --> 02:07:13.940
All righty.

02:07:13.940 --> 02:07:16.500
Del The Funky Homo Sapien with Dr. Bombay in a very, very

02:07:16.500 --> 02:07:18.180
close vote tonight.

02:07:18.180 --> 02:07:21.140
The funk is guaranteed to make my day.

02:07:21.140 --> 02:07:23.100
So, so, so, little girl.

02:07:23.100 --> 02:07:24.540
Mars is a black woman's movie.

02:07:24.540 --> 02:07:25.260
All right.

02:07:25.260 --> 02:07:27.180
Check and turn and settle to the left.

02:07:27.180 --> 02:07:30.740
That will be in rotation all week long on Orange on

02:07:30.740 --> 02:07:33.380
Australia, and we'll come back for its chance at a second

02:07:33.380 --> 02:07:34.180
week victory.

02:07:34.180 --> 02:07:38.660
But boys and girls, songs that prevail in three-way ties

02:07:38.660 --> 02:07:40.300
very rarely last more than one week.

02:07:40.300 --> 02:07:41.140
But we shall see.

02:07:41.140 --> 02:07:42.620
We shall see.

02:07:42.620 --> 02:07:43.260
All right.

02:07:43.260 --> 02:07:46.940
Loki, you don't want your song to win out anyway.

02:07:46.940 --> 02:07:48.340
Oh, I like this in the chat room.

02:07:48.340 --> 02:07:49.900
Skye's will is absolute.

02:07:49.900 --> 02:07:50.820
I like this.

02:07:50.820 --> 02:07:51.780
Makes me feel special.

02:07:55.900 --> 02:07:57.540
Pardon me while I stroke my ego here.

02:07:57.540 --> 02:07:58.420
We're going to go to a break.

02:07:58.420 --> 02:07:59.900
And when we come back from this break, we will be taking-

02:07:59.900 --> 02:08:02.580
Is that your ego?

02:08:02.580 --> 02:08:03.980
You're disgusting.

02:08:03.980 --> 02:08:07.020
When we come back from this break,

02:08:07.020 --> 02:08:08.980
we will take your calls on the Skype line,

02:08:08.980 --> 02:08:11.940
and of course, we will get to the FUs of the week as well.

02:08:11.940 --> 02:08:15.420
And I think that statement there brings a certain song

02:08:15.420 --> 02:08:16.700
to mind that needs playing.

02:08:16.700 --> 02:08:18.620
So let's get to a little bit of DJ Taka here.

02:08:18.620 --> 02:08:21.540
We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio.

02:09:21.540 --> 02:09:26.540
a

02:09:26.540 --> 02:09:31.540
a

02:09:31.540 --> 02:09:36.540
a

02:09:36.540 --> 02:09:41.540
a

02:09:41.540 --> 02:09:46.540
a

02:10:16.540 --> 02:10:18.540
You

02:14:16.540 --> 02:14:19.040
Now I'm saying goodbye, don't do it

02:14:20.040 --> 02:14:25.040
And if I'm sleeping still, oh, I'm thinking of your sweet, sweet mama

02:14:25.040 --> 02:14:29.540
Well, I like your good, your good, but I just can't decide

02:14:30.540 --> 02:14:33.540
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

02:14:33.540 --> 02:14:35.540
Let me know if you love me

02:15:03.540 --> 02:15:18.260
Take away, take away, take away, take away

02:15:18.260 --> 02:15:21.260
Are you ready?

02:15:21.260 --> 02:15:23.260
Are you ready?

02:15:23.260 --> 02:15:26.260
Are you ready?

02:15:26.260 --> 02:15:27.260
Are you ready?

02:15:27.260 --> 02:15:24.420
Let up

02:15:24.420 --> 02:15:26.260
Are you ready?

02:15:26.260 --> 02:15:27.260
Are you ready?

02:15:27.260 --> 02:15:28.260
Are you ready?

02:15:28.260 --> 02:15:30.260
Are you ready?

02:15:30.260 --> 02:15:35.260
Are you ready?

02:15:35.260 --> 02:15:36.260
Are you ready?

02:15:36.260 --> 02:15:43.260
Are you ready?

02:15:43.260 --> 02:15:44.760
Are you ready?

02:15:44.760 --> 02:15:47.260
Are you ready?

02:15:47.260 --> 02:16:09.540
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of

02:16:09.540 --> 02:16:12.940
the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:16:12.940 --> 02:16:18.440
Um, Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bamani Music & More program. Can we talk about that?

02:16:18.440 --> 02:16:20.940
No subject will ever be taboo.

02:16:20.940 --> 02:16:24.940
Well, I was thinking maybe we should move, pump up the volume from Tuesday nights?

02:16:24.940 --> 02:16:27.940
Except, of course, the subject that was just on our discussion.

02:16:27.940 --> 02:16:33.940
Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

02:16:33.940 --> 02:16:35.940
I collect your fucking head.

02:16:37.440 --> 02:16:39.440
Just like this fucker here.

02:16:39.440 --> 02:16:48.440
kostjamrh Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki? The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

02:16:48.440 --> 02:16:55.440
Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

02:16:55.440 --> 02:17:03.440
Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say

02:17:03.440 --> 02:17:08.440
We need to make our listeners do the work for us, honestly.

02:17:08.440 --> 02:17:09.440
I have an idea for one.

02:17:09.440 --> 02:17:10.440
Do you?

02:17:10.440 --> 02:17:11.440
Yeah.

02:17:11.440 --> 02:17:15.440
We need to make a thread in our super secret forum and keep these ideas flowing.

02:17:15.440 --> 02:17:18.440
Because sometimes I think of ideas at work and then I forget to write them down and then they're gone forever.

02:17:18.440 --> 02:17:21.440
I have to sneak onto the web page to be able to update at work.

02:17:21.440 --> 02:17:23.440
Well, you can always send me an email and I'll post it for you.

02:17:23.440 --> 02:17:24.440
Okay.

02:17:24.440 --> 02:17:25.440
Because you can do that.

02:17:25.440 --> 02:17:26.440
Isn't that weird that you can do email but you can't do internet?

02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:28.440
An email that doesn't work half the time.

02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:32.600
because the thing of the way that the email at my work is is that they're supposed to

02:17:32.600 --> 02:17:37.680
be sort of server to block outside mail, which actually only works half of the time and never

02:17:37.680 --> 02:17:46.120
works on you. I always get your email. And no, none of you in the chat room get my work

02:17:46.120 --> 02:17:50.400
email, so sawed off.

02:17:50.400 --> 02:17:56.520
All right. The Skype line is open. If you guys want to give us a call, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

02:17:56.520 --> 02:17:59.480
on interact with us and look at that it's lighting up already

02:17:59.480 --> 02:18:03.400
I think our listeners are starting to understand that when they don't call in

02:18:03.400 --> 02:18:07.320
that Paris Hilton is going to come up so they're getting smart so we have a call

02:18:07.320 --> 02:18:09.480
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio

02:18:09.480 --> 02:18:11.920
Hi, Sephiroth1215 here

02:18:11.920 --> 02:18:15.960
Hello, Sephiroth1215 and I know you're calling in to talk about that new Paris Hilton

02:18:15.960 --> 02:18:18.120
Carl's Jr. commercial, right?

02:18:18.120 --> 02:18:21.200
Yeah, of course, that's pretty cool

02:18:21.200 --> 02:18:23.440
That's hot, huh?

02:18:23.440 --> 02:18:26.200
Oh yeah, it is

02:18:26.200 --> 02:18:28.200
Yes, what's on your mind?

02:18:28.840 --> 02:18:32.440
I don't know just some random stuff. I guess oh I

02:18:32.960 --> 02:18:37.660
Mean last week. I got you know the in the groove and afterburner pad bundle

02:18:38.120 --> 02:18:41.960
What do you think because I honestly I haven't picked up in the groove yet

02:18:41.960 --> 02:18:46.320
And that has nothing to do with like Loki's distaste of the game rubbing off on me or anything

02:18:46.320 --> 02:18:49.500
It's just that I actually don't have an American ps2

02:18:49.500 --> 02:18:52.760
And I don't want to mod my Japanese one because I know I will fuck it up

02:18:52.760 --> 02:18:58.760
So I am kind of waiting until I can afford an American PS2, so I'm curious. How's the game?

02:18:58.760 --> 02:19:05.760
It's okay. It's going to hold me over until like September, you know, when Extreme 2 comes out.

02:19:05.760 --> 02:19:12.760
Not to mention, with the After Burner pad, I have to basically go back to all the other games and get new scores on them.

02:19:12.760 --> 02:19:14.760
So I'm pretty good this summer.

02:19:14.760 --> 02:19:17.760
What do you think of the After Burner pad? That's the brand new Metal pad, right?

02:19:17.760 --> 02:19:19.760
So how's that working out for you?

02:19:19.760 --> 02:19:25.080
At first, I thought it wasn't worth the money, but once I broke in the arrows, everything

02:19:25.080 --> 02:19:29.640
was perfectly fine. It works great. I mean, I have a lot of fun with it.

02:19:29.640 --> 02:19:34.600
How much are your scores improving on the old games?

02:19:34.600 --> 02:19:39.920
Pretty much by a whole grade. Awesome. Secret, I have a curious question.

02:19:39.920 --> 02:19:42.760
I don't know if you can answer this or what, but when you guys are testing the game at

02:19:42.760 --> 02:19:46.880
Konami, I know you guys don't actually... Use softpads.

02:19:46.880 --> 02:19:51.880
You do play Konami softpads. Oh, you use the official Konami pads, you don't use the other products.

02:19:51.880 --> 02:19:56.880
I was just curious if you ever used the metal stuff. I'll tell you why after we're off the air.

02:19:56.880 --> 02:19:59.880
Okay, okay. Sounds good.

02:19:59.880 --> 02:20:02.880
Um, let's see, so...

02:20:02.880 --> 02:20:05.880
What else have you been playing besides In the Groove?

02:20:05.880 --> 02:20:07.880
And the old games?

02:20:07.880 --> 02:20:12.880
Well, I don't know, there hasn't been much otherwise for normal games.

02:20:12.880 --> 02:20:18.880
I'm just going some old stuff now. I just got Star Ocean since it went to a greatest hits price.

02:20:18.880 --> 02:20:21.880
I love that when the games get cheaper, because they're greatest hits.

02:20:21.880 --> 02:20:24.880
That's usually when I end up buying them.

02:20:24.880 --> 02:20:25.880
Awesome.

02:20:25.880 --> 02:20:27.880
And it's been happening rapidly.

02:20:27.880 --> 02:20:30.880
Okay, anything else you wanted to call in tonight, ask us about?

02:20:30.880 --> 02:20:34.880
Any questions for us here in the studio, or Seagurd, our guest, or whatever?

02:20:34.880 --> 02:20:37.880
Not really. I guess I'm good now.

02:20:37.880 --> 02:20:40.880
Alright, sounds good. Well thank you for calling in.

02:20:40.880 --> 02:20:41.880
No problem.

02:20:41.880 --> 02:20:43.880
Alright, anytime. Have a good one.

02:20:43.880 --> 02:20:45.880
You too. Bye.

02:20:45.880 --> 02:20:47.880
Alright.

02:20:47.880 --> 02:20:49.880
Skyfline's open again if you want to give us a call.

02:20:49.880 --> 02:20:51.880
www.orangelaungeradio.com

02:20:51.880 --> 02:20:53.880
Click on interact with us and that has all

02:20:53.880 --> 02:20:55.880
the details you need

02:20:55.880 --> 02:20:57.880
in order to connect with us.

02:20:57.880 --> 02:20:59.880
While we're waiting for

02:20:59.880 --> 02:21:01.880
another call, if we get one, I don't know

02:21:01.880 --> 02:21:03.880
like I said, our listeners are down. I don't know

02:21:03.880 --> 02:21:05.880
if it's just college or they're studying for finals

02:21:05.880 --> 02:21:07.880
or graduating or whatever's going on in your neck of the woods.

02:21:07.880 --> 02:21:09.880
I want to mention real quick

02:21:09.880 --> 02:21:13.680
that we actually have a LiveJournal system set up. Now you guys know about

02:21:13.680 --> 02:21:17.360
our LiveJournal community at Orange Lounge. Well this, I didn't know about

02:21:17.360 --> 02:21:22.160
this until tonight. One of our listeners, Arcadia, excuse me, Arcadia 42 is also a

02:21:22.160 --> 02:21:28.120
frequent guest of the show, actually created an Orange Lounge radio podcast

02:21:28.120 --> 02:21:33.460
feed in LiveJournal. Now it doesn't actually automatically download the

02:21:33.460 --> 02:21:38.000
podcast for you, but what it does, if you add this to your LiveJournal, it will let

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:42.620
you know when a new one has been posted so you can think oh okay it's time to go

02:21:42.620 --> 02:21:47.640
in and sync using iPod or it's time to go in and you know grab it on Podcast

02:21:47.640 --> 02:21:52.040
Alley or whatever you guys are using to get our podcast. The name of the

02:21:52.040 --> 02:21:58.160
community is O-L-R underscore podcast and if you want to be able to find the whole

02:21:58.160 --> 02:22:04.840
link there it's just www.livejournal.com slash users slash O-L-R underscore

02:22:04.840 --> 02:22:09.520

02:22:09.520 --> 02:22:12.800
you will know when new podcasts are posted. You also get the brief little description

02:22:12.800 --> 02:22:18.480
about what we talk about on each one, our little synopsis. So check that out. And also

02:22:18.480 --> 02:22:26.120
don't forget to vote for us over on podcastalley.com because we appreciate your vote. And there's

02:22:26.120 --> 02:22:30.320
also another we need your help type thing I will talk about a little later. I'm going

02:22:30.320 --> 02:22:37.080
to bring that up in a few minutes here after we get through some other stuff. I do not

02:22:37.080 --> 02:22:43.880
see any other calls coming in so I guess that's it. There's quite a few people online so I'm

02:22:43.880 --> 02:22:47.200
kind of surprised that nobody else wants to call but that's fine. A question from our

02:22:47.200 --> 02:22:51.560
chat room though, I think this is more for Dark Sacra. When does the podcast Poop Shoot

02:22:51.560 --> 02:22:58.800
go live? You know what? I've been busy. Did you turn up my microphone? Yeah, you're on.

02:22:58.800 --> 02:22:59.800
You turned up my microphone, though.

02:22:59.800 --> 02:23:00.800
No, it's not.

02:23:00.800 --> 02:23:01.800
It's too loud.

02:23:01.800 --> 02:23:02.800
It's...

02:23:02.800 --> 02:23:03.800
I turned up the in-house speakers.

02:23:03.800 --> 02:23:04.800
Okay.

02:23:04.800 --> 02:23:05.800
Turn this down, please.

02:23:05.800 --> 02:23:06.800
Sorry.

02:23:06.800 --> 02:23:07.800
Not...

02:23:07.800 --> 02:23:08.800
I...

02:23:08.800 --> 02:23:09.800
Hearing the reverb gives this, like, instant headache for me.

02:23:09.800 --> 02:23:13.160
I have to turn it up to hear the calls on Skype.

02:23:13.160 --> 02:23:14.160
Yeah.

02:23:14.160 --> 02:23:15.160
All right.

02:23:15.160 --> 02:23:19.160
At any rate, if you come over to my house and pack up all my crap and move it to my

02:23:19.160 --> 02:23:21.800
new house, then maybe I'll make it.

02:23:21.800 --> 02:23:22.800
So...

02:23:22.800 --> 02:23:26.280
Or pay for the domain for me.

02:23:26.280 --> 02:23:27.280
I don't know.

02:23:27.280 --> 02:23:32.360
I'm still looking for someone to take the domain I registered and never used for a death

02:23:32.360 --> 02:23:33.360
cake.

02:23:33.360 --> 02:23:36.280
And you could make a pornography site out of it if you want.

02:23:36.280 --> 02:23:37.280
No, that's okay.

02:23:37.280 --> 02:23:40.000
I've actually registered lastlivingsouls.com.

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:41.000
Alright.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:45.760
So anyways, our chat room is saying they're all shy, they don't want to call in and be

02:23:45.760 --> 02:23:46.760
on air tonight.

02:23:46.760 --> 02:23:47.760
Fine.

02:23:47.760 --> 02:23:48.760
So anyways.

02:23:48.760 --> 02:23:49.760
At least we got the one going.

02:23:49.760 --> 02:23:53.480
If you don't call in, I will come over to your house and personally kick your butt until

02:23:53.480 --> 02:23:54.480
you call in.

02:23:54.480 --> 02:23:55.480
Well, we did get one person.

02:23:55.480 --> 02:23:56.480
No, no, no, no, no, no.

02:23:56.480 --> 02:24:14.480
Well anyways, the thing I was working on before. See, before when I was playing around with this program called RPG Maker 2003, the thing that I didn't like about it the most was having to draw all the, like, sprite graphics and stuff, and that really kind of frustrated me because I had really good ideas, but I didn't want to have to draw everything because that takes way too much time.

02:24:14.480 --> 02:24:16.480
I hate drawing too. I'm just not good at it.

02:24:16.480 --> 02:24:21.600
Especially since plotting out an RPG is like way too much work as it is.

02:24:21.600 --> 02:24:27.960
So I figured I'd go ahead and play around the program some more because the mods for

02:24:27.960 --> 02:24:30.400
Beats of Rage actually have sprites in them.

02:24:30.400 --> 02:24:31.400
So that's kind of nice.

02:24:31.400 --> 02:24:33.960
So I'm stealing those because I'm lazy.

02:24:33.960 --> 02:24:37.240
So I am making an RPG.

02:24:37.240 --> 02:24:38.240
It'll be fun.

02:24:38.240 --> 02:24:39.240
Oh, wait.

02:24:39.240 --> 02:24:40.240
Is that your new project?

02:24:40.240 --> 02:24:41.240
That's my new project.

02:24:41.240 --> 02:24:42.240
All right.

02:24:42.240 --> 02:24:44.120
But the best part.

02:24:44.120 --> 02:24:45.120
We're in it.

02:24:45.120 --> 02:24:46.120
Oh, great.

02:24:46.120 --> 02:24:48.120
Wait, did you draw something?

02:24:48.120 --> 02:24:52.120
As the collective groan arises from the studio.

02:24:52.120 --> 02:24:54.120
DarkSucker, you look frightened by that.

02:24:54.120 --> 02:24:56.120
I can draw, you know.

02:24:56.120 --> 02:25:00.120
Well, I know, but I don't need you guys to draw anything.

02:25:00.120 --> 02:25:02.120
Oh, you don't need us!

02:25:02.120 --> 02:25:04.120
You don't need our help!

02:25:04.120 --> 02:25:07.120
Fine! I hope your project sucks!

02:25:07.120 --> 02:25:13.120
I figured out who the villain's going to be, but I can't say, because it's going to be funny. Trust me.

02:25:13.120 --> 02:25:16.080
Yeah, I know who you would make the villain. You'd make the villain like

02:25:16.080 --> 02:25:18.440
Rockstar or something. Anyway, we gotta call. No. What?

02:25:18.440 --> 02:25:21.440
Bigger than Rockstar. Oh, boy. Here we go. Alright, we gotta call.

02:25:21.440 --> 02:25:25.960
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

02:25:25.960 --> 02:25:31.960
Okay. That's it! I go back to spamming the chatroom! Now you're not on Orange Lawn's radio.

02:25:31.960 --> 02:25:35.320
So anyways, as I was talking about the game.

02:25:35.320 --> 02:25:38.400
Well, F you too! I see how it is.

02:25:38.400 --> 02:25:40.300
Great. Okay.

02:25:40.300 --> 02:25:41.540
Think Kingdom Hearts

02:25:41.540 --> 02:25:47.060
minus the Disney characters, and all the console characters, like a lot of console characters.

02:25:47.060 --> 02:25:49.480
And just have random, like, you know, villains in it.

02:25:49.480 --> 02:25:52.000
But there's one big villain that's in charge of everything.

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:57.980
And he's the worst video game villain. It's Mr. Spanky, isn't it? No, it's not Mr. Spanky. Bigger.

02:25:57.980 --> 02:26:00.380
Yeah, think bigger.

02:26:00.380 --> 02:26:04.340
I don't know. I can't give it away, I'm not going to give any hints, only because it's hilarious.

02:26:04.340 --> 02:26:05.280
Buggy-buggy!

02:26:05.280 --> 02:26:08.180
And I've got another person making a cameo in this

02:26:08.180 --> 02:26:10.180
who's related to

02:26:10.180 --> 02:26:12.820
our show but not to be

02:26:12.820 --> 02:26:18.140
we i can't i can't say i find it'll be funny trust me it's great i'm gonna work

02:26:18.140 --> 02:26:20.500
on it but i can see it too much more about it does

02:26:20.500 --> 02:26:25.180
al the follower finish it or get the uh... urge to actually work on itself

02:26:25.180 --> 02:26:27.060
but i'm hopefully gonna have it done

02:26:27.060 --> 02:26:29.340
you know within like a year

02:26:29.340 --> 02:26:31.340
uh... i think you're

02:26:31.340 --> 02:26:32.180
hey

02:26:32.180 --> 02:26:36.140
i'm given clear job to do this full-time this is more important

02:26:36.140 --> 02:26:38.140
It'll be cool when it's done, okay?

02:26:38.140 --> 02:26:43.140
The walking around, like, overworld music needs to be, like, the Goonies' song.

02:26:43.140 --> 02:26:48.140
There's gonna be evil characters in, like, I've already decided there's gonna be Evil Ken.

02:26:48.140 --> 02:26:50.140
He's gonna be one of the characters you have to fight in it.

02:26:50.140 --> 02:26:51.140
How about Evil Rob?

02:26:51.140 --> 02:26:53.140
There's gonna be Emo Dan.

02:26:53.140 --> 02:26:55.140
Like, Dan from Street Fighter?

02:26:55.140 --> 02:26:56.140
Oh, I thought maybe, no.

02:26:56.140 --> 02:26:58.140
Oh wait, Aji!

02:26:58.140 --> 02:27:01.140
Cause he's kinda depressed as it is, so I thought that would be funny.

02:27:01.140 --> 02:27:05.140
I'd like to see Emo Dan, who manages the GameStop.

02:27:05.140 --> 02:27:11.140
I can make that character Dan. That's angry Dan who manages the gamestop. I know, that's why it's funny to be anal Dan.

02:27:11.140 --> 02:27:21.140
It'll be funny, it'll have references from stuff, it'll have inside jokes, it'll be great, and it'll just have like, you know, fun stuff, you know.

02:27:21.140 --> 02:27:28.140
Alright. Like, Dark Sakura will summon an attack that'll involve the gorillas, you know.

02:27:28.140 --> 02:27:30.140
Yeah, the jeep comes running out.

02:27:30.140 --> 02:27:32.140
Running out, run over whoever.

02:27:32.140 --> 02:27:34.140
Your mic going crazy.

02:27:34.140 --> 02:27:36.140
Yeah, I know what's up with that.

02:27:36.140 --> 02:27:38.140
Alright.

02:27:38.140 --> 02:27:40.140
Alright. Jamie, don't bother berating the chatroom.

02:27:40.140 --> 02:27:42.140
We've got other things to get to.

02:27:42.140 --> 02:27:44.140
We'll just...

02:27:44.140 --> 02:27:46.140
They can be shy if they want. Actually, I think the person

02:27:46.140 --> 02:27:48.140
who tried to call in was saying that their settings

02:27:48.140 --> 02:27:50.140
were screwed up, but we'll open it up again.

02:27:50.140 --> 02:27:52.140
I can't breathe.

02:27:52.140 --> 02:27:54.140
After this, what, are you okay?

02:27:54.140 --> 02:27:56.140
I can only breathe through one nostril.

02:27:56.140 --> 02:27:59.740
it sounds like you're ready to do some venting aren't you.

02:27:59.740 --> 02:28:04.260
So I think we need to get to the FUs of the week don't we?

02:28:04.260 --> 02:28:10.720
So Dark Sakura why is it that we do the FUs of the week every single freaking

02:28:10.720 --> 02:28:11.140
week

02:28:11.140 --> 02:28:18.140
Grr ARG

02:28:18.140 --> 02:28:31.140
Dude, I love my F.U. music now. It's Angel Stanatos from Silent Hill 2. It's, like, awesome.

02:28:31.140 --> 02:28:38.140
Anyway, uh, my first F.U. goes to Dust. It goes to throwing away shit I wanted to keep,

02:28:38.140 --> 02:28:44.640
except I'm too pack ratty. Uh, F.U. to Dust again. F.U. to my nostril being plugged on

02:28:44.640 --> 02:28:57.920
one side um f you to food um f you to the pizza that i ate yesterday uh crap f you to

02:28:57.920 --> 02:29:03.840
the 50 boxes sitting in my living room and the fact that my cat is afraid of everything now

02:29:04.720 --> 02:29:08.480
she's been living in her litter box since we started moving all those boxes downstairs

02:29:08.480 --> 02:29:14.160
and why the fuck do i have so much stuff i swear i trip it over controllers and video

02:29:14.160 --> 02:29:20.980
game systems and the cat and like RC cars we found our initial DRC car. You didn't pack

02:29:20.980 --> 02:29:25.740
Shermie did you? No, Shermie will pack herself in her litter box until we're

02:29:25.740 --> 02:29:30.020
moved. Then at the point that we are at the new location she will proceed to

02:29:30.020 --> 02:29:35.420
live in her litter box for a week like she did the last two times. Shermie has

02:29:35.420 --> 02:29:40.340
been with us through one move already. She knows things. She knows this is a

02:29:40.340 --> 02:29:44.340
this strange place that dogs used to live at. Oh yeah, I'm probably going to have to

02:29:44.340 --> 02:29:50.480
endure a couple of weeks worth of allergies from chows and cigarette smoke that used to

02:29:50.480 --> 02:29:56.800
reside in the house. They had smoking dogs. No, but he, well I know he stopped smoking

02:29:56.800 --> 02:30:03.200
once the baby was born. Which is good, but it's still in the house and it still stinks.

02:30:03.200 --> 02:30:07.000
You know I saw this thing today in the magazine at the haircut place where Shane went where

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:11.000
where it was showing pregnant celebrities like Britney Spears and stuff

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:15.000
uh... who's the other one? It was Britney Spears and one of the other ones

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:18.000
Baby Killers! And it showed their smoking husbands

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
Baby Killers! Right in front of them

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
Where do you have the ones that actually do smoke themselves?

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
Britney was smoking while she was pregnant

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
Well she didn't know she was pregnant, right?

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:27.000
No, she was pregnant

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:28.000
What a dumbass!

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
She's a stupid bitch, I'm sorry

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:31.000
Anyway

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:35.000
She can't have a smart baby because how else will they grow up to be a pop singer?

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:40.000
Sorry to derail that, I'm sorry.

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
Back to you and your friends.

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
I'm done.

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:45.000
Fuck you, baby killer!

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:50.000
Alright, let's go to Loki.

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
Loki to my stomach for being empty.

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:56.000
I want food, and I don't have food, so I gotta, you know, find food at home,

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
which I'm sure we don't have food there either.

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
I have some damn in the kitchen.

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
I don't want any damn.

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:08.000
Damn, by the way, is D-A-I-M, and it's little miniature heat barks. Delicious, I gotta go to that queue.

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:37.280
still smell them on me after I've brushed my teeth a few times and washed my hands repeatedly.

02:31:37.280 --> 02:31:43.400
They still smell like onion. It's like it's just toxic or something and I don't know what

02:31:43.400 --> 02:31:57.400
to do. And that's about it. My turn. I want to give it a F-you to Nintendo for fucking

02:31:57.400 --> 02:32:01.760
being a bunch of dicks in WarioWare Twisted and putting in that Kid Icarus record and

02:32:01.760 --> 02:32:06.440
saying haha this is the closest thing you're going to get to a sequel wahaha I hate you

02:32:06.440 --> 02:32:10.400

02:32:48.940 --> 02:32:58.840
of the week. I love that song. I have no FUs of the week. You have nothing? I have a work

02:32:58.840 --> 02:33:04.120
related thing I can't do over the air, but that's it. I'm pretty happy. So just do the

02:33:04.120 --> 02:33:10.960
FU to general work angst. That's alright. FU to trance music. There we go. Generic boring

02:33:10.960 --> 02:33:12.820
trans music

02:33:12.820 --> 02:33:13.760
they get you that

02:33:13.760 --> 02:33:15.620

02:33:18.940 --> 02:33:20.140

uh...

02:33:21.340 --> 02:33:22.960
fuck you too

02:33:22.960 --> 02:33:25.580
three hundred-pound six at wal-mart

02:33:32.060 --> 02:33:32.700

02:33:32.700 --> 02:33:36.000
let's go to the chair of the two at the same

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.460
uh... tomorrow says

02:33:38.460 --> 02:33:47.420
FU to crayons. Why? Why not? I happen to like crayons, personally. This tastes like purple!

02:33:47.420 --> 02:33:53.540
Uh, let's see. That's not an FU. That's not an FU. You guys are sending me personal messages.

02:33:53.540 --> 02:33:58.380
Dark Knight says, my FU goes to this weekend. Be short. I didn't, I so didn't want it to

02:33:58.380 --> 02:34:06.380
end. I agree, the weekend's been short. Um, Misty says, my first FU is to cage match.

02:34:06.380 --> 02:34:10.940
to work because we have whoppers on sales for 99 cents tomorrow. Not that she's hiding

02:34:10.940 --> 02:34:15.140
where she works or anything. I may rant about this more in that F.U. thread in the forums

02:34:15.140 --> 02:34:19.260
in my live journal when I get home tomorrow. That's what live journal is for. Thank you

02:34:19.260 --> 02:34:24.660
for recognizing what live journal is for. StupidBaka says, an F.U. to some random guy

02:34:24.660 --> 02:34:29.580
that almost hit me on Friday while I was walking to City College for class. He almost hit me

02:34:29.580 --> 02:34:34.020
and even dared to yell, get out of the way, you fucking punk. So of course I got out of

02:34:34.020 --> 02:34:38.020
the way and when he drives like half a block and stops to look back at me saying watch

02:34:38.020 --> 02:34:42.700
for cars, dumbass. So of course I flip him the bird and yell at him to watch his shit

02:34:42.700 --> 02:34:49.220
cause I scratched his car in a lightning bolt. What? I scratched his car in a lightning bolt?

02:34:49.220 --> 02:34:56.220
That doesn't make sense. So yeah, fuck you to drivers. Dark Tetsuya says F you to myself

02:34:56.220 --> 02:35:03.060
I fried my Playstation by dropping it. Whoops. You know I fried my Gamecube because I was

02:35:03.060 --> 02:35:08.060
I was trying to play WarioWare Twisted and the Game Boy Player and it just, it wasn't working.

02:35:08.060 --> 02:35:13.060
Doops says, F you to Orlando being so damn far from where I live.

02:35:13.060 --> 02:35:18.060
And F you to Drawn Together for making Gay Link funny.

02:35:18.060 --> 02:35:23.060
Short F you list today. Cause Xander was Gay Link.

02:35:23.060 --> 02:35:28.060
Didn't that show come on like 8 months ago and hasn't done anything since?

02:35:28.060 --> 02:35:31.860
or just a little slow. It's all right. Maybe the DVDs just came out or something. I don't

02:35:31.860 --> 02:35:39.500
know. Maybe. I don't know. I would get on that. No. Apparently not. So. I totally would

02:35:39.500 --> 02:35:47.220
buy drawn together DVDs. That's awesome. All right. We will go ahead and open up the Skype

02:35:47.220 --> 02:35:50.840
line one more time. Give it a try. See if we get any calls. You can give us a call over

02:35:50.840 --> 02:35:56.600
or on www.orangelaungeradio.com, click on interact with us.

02:35:56.600 --> 02:35:59.440
In the meantime, one thing I wanted to bring up

02:35:59.440 --> 02:36:03.980
was a way you can help us, actually.

02:36:03.980 --> 02:36:06.720
And now I can't remember where the site was.

02:36:06.720 --> 02:36:11.800
Oh yes, it's podcastawards.com.

02:36:11.800 --> 02:36:14.400
And we're trying to get ourselves nominated.

02:36:14.400 --> 02:36:17.120
Because originally I wasn't going to push for this one

02:36:17.120 --> 02:36:20.820
because there was just a general technology category.

02:36:20.820 --> 02:36:25.220
And there's no point, because Leo Laporte in This Week in Tech would just

02:36:25.220 --> 02:36:27.700
whoop everybody's ass, so there's really no point, right?

02:36:27.700 --> 02:36:29.060
So we were just not even gonna try.

02:36:29.060 --> 02:36:33.900
But now, in going to podcastawards.com, we find that they have

02:36:33.900 --> 02:36:37.540
added a new category for best gaming podcast.

02:36:39.620 --> 02:36:41.620
So- I cast a spell.

02:36:41.620 --> 02:36:47.180
So vote your conscience, but remember that we like people who help us out.

02:36:47.180 --> 02:36:50.580
So go to podcasting, is it podcasting?

02:36:50.580 --> 02:36:56.120
podcastawards.com all one word and click on the big nominate now by the way it's

02:36:56.120 --> 02:37:00.140
the very last category listed on the page way in the bottom right gaming and

02:37:00.140 --> 02:37:04.980
just fill that in you just put your email address orange lounge radio to go

02:37:04.980 --> 02:37:09.540
and our website and the XML and any other comments you want if you don't

02:37:09.540 --> 02:37:12.300
know the XML I will post that information in the chat room in a little

02:37:12.300 --> 02:37:17.540
bit so we appreciate all your help because we like getting stuff it's cool

02:37:17.540 --> 02:37:23.060
like awards I'm doing it right now and I'm hoping that the podcast awards are

02:37:23.060 --> 02:37:27.100
actually filled with chocolate or something because that would be cool

02:37:27.100 --> 02:37:30.580
like if the podcasting awards were actually made out of like solid milk

02:37:30.580 --> 02:37:34.400
chocolate or something and I could eat it that would be yummy or made out of

02:37:34.400 --> 02:37:39.820
damn that'd be great all right we're gonna go to another break and we come

02:37:39.820 --> 02:37:44.500
back from this break we're gonna do some ask orange lounge that's right send in

02:37:44.500 --> 02:37:49.140
your questions over private message to Sky in the chat room. It's your chance to take

02:37:49.140 --> 02:37:58.180
over the show and ask us any questions that you want. All right. So we will be back after

02:37:58.180 --> 02:38:02.220
this break. And in this break, I think we need to hear some para para because I'm feeling

02:38:02.220 --> 02:38:06.620
a little sluggish here and I want to wake up. I need to wake up a little bit here. So

02:38:06.620 --> 02:38:10.300
we'll start it off with Jamie's request here and we'll be back with more Orange Lounge

02:38:10.300 --> 02:38:13.560
Radio. For those of you guys in chat, I will post more information on how to vote for us

02:38:13.560 --> 02:38:20.560
on PodcastWords. We'll be back after this.

02:38:43.560 --> 02:38:47.060
It's a long night, and the fucking sun's all coming down

02:38:47.060 --> 02:38:49.060
It's a long night

02:39:01.060 --> 02:39:05.560
Hurry up my little guy, everyone is getting all the secrets, baby

02:39:07.060 --> 02:39:11.560
Come on baby, come on boy, won't you really be the only one in this doggy hole?

02:39:11.560 --> 02:39:18.560
Bellfire, bellfire, sticking together with you Dancing, dancing, you gotta move, you're moving

02:39:18.560 --> 02:39:24.560
Bellfire, bellfire, jumping together with you Roll the beat, come on and dance tonight

02:39:24.560 --> 02:39:30.560
Bellfire into the music countdown Bellfire into the new century

Bellfire into the future coming here all tonight Bellfire 2000

02:39:36.560 --> 02:39:42.560
I fell far into the music countdown I fell far into the new century

02:39:42.560 --> 02:39:46.560
I fell far into the future, call me if you're all night

02:39:46.560 --> 02:39:48.560
And I found some tiles on countdown

02:39:48.560 --> 02:39:50.560
Please don't fight

02:40:08.560 --> 02:40:10.560
Give it all back

02:40:10.560 --> 02:40:12.560
Go, go, go, go, go!

02:40:24.560 --> 02:40:27.560
This music makes you feel higher and

02:40:27.560 --> 02:40:30.560
It's breathing deep, we're into the sun

02:40:30.560 --> 02:40:33.560
Just move your head and get me higher and

02:40:33.560 --> 02:40:36.560
Night is only me and you

02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:39.560
I need to touch your body, touch your body

02:41:09.560 --> 02:41:11.960
I'd like to tell the world you're a big girl

02:41:11.960 --> 02:41:13.560
We got to let them go

02:41:25.560 --> 02:41:27.160
Give it all back

02:41:29.160 --> 02:41:31.160
I'm on my own

02:41:31.160 --> 02:41:59.160
Welcome to the rock'n'roll, welcome to the famous hit or night

02:41:59.160 --> 02:42:04.160
Come on, lady, come on, girl Come on, lady, girl, you have to write

02:42:04.160 --> 02:42:12.160
Not the danger, not the best stranger Rock it, rock it, I can't help you at all

02:42:12.160 --> 02:42:16.160
I'll also make my name, I'll make it if you know how

02:42:16.160 --> 02:42:19.160
I'd like to be your president

02:42:19.160 --> 02:42:25.160
Night's on fire, you better, better think You better, better forget the phrase to say

02:42:55.160 --> 02:43:23.160
I got something really happy just to tell You I got something really happy just to tell

02:43:23.160 --> 02:43:26.160
I got somethin' really happy just to tell you, baby

02:43:26.160 --> 02:43:28.160
Look at the sun, I don't even know

02:43:29.160 --> 02:43:32.160
Ready to dive into the trail, but together

02:43:32.160 --> 02:43:34.160
All you girls can dance

02:43:34.160 --> 02:43:35.160
It's funny, I know

02:43:35.160 --> 02:43:37.160
Preaching the mixing star

02:43:37.160 --> 02:43:38.160
With fire, fire

02:43:38.160 --> 02:43:40.160
We just can't change the taste

02:43:40.160 --> 02:43:42.160
We've got some music that we make

02:43:42.160 --> 02:43:45.160
Sing a song with me, oh, sorry

02:43:45.160 --> 02:43:48.160
Wanna get some chicken in the lake, oh, sorry

02:43:48.160 --> 02:43:51.160
Like a girl from the fun, oh, sorry

02:43:51.160 --> 02:43:53.660
Can you hear me now, it's time to rise

02:43:53.660 --> 02:43:57.160
It's my new day, do you know, I'm falling

02:43:57.160 --> 02:43:59.660
All you can see me in the dark

02:43:59.660 --> 02:44:02.160
I'm taking time like a bird from Japan

02:44:02.160 --> 02:44:03.660
I'm falling

02:44:03.660 --> 02:44:06.160
Can you hear me now, it's time to rise

02:44:06.160 --> 02:44:31.160
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

02:44:31.160 --> 02:44:33.160
Do we want to be accepted by Hollywood?

02:44:33.160 --> 02:44:35.160
No!

02:44:35.160 --> 02:44:37.160
Do we care what people think of us?

02:44:37.160 --> 02:44:39.160
No!

02:44:39.160 --> 02:44:41.160
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

02:44:41.160 --> 02:44:43.160
Yeah!

02:44:45.160 --> 02:44:51.160
Extreme Bimani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:44:51.160 --> 02:44:53.160
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:44:53.160 --> 02:44:59.160
Loki, I found more information on that thing you were brought up earlier about in the groove and the whole crash thing.

02:44:59.160 --> 02:45:02.960
It's actually in a story that was posted over on ddrfreak.com.

02:45:02.960 --> 02:45:09.500
It talks about the game will crash on auto-load, basically corrupting a player's saved game.

02:45:09.500 --> 02:45:17.200
All you have to do, if the top grade sorting order is deselected as the default sort order,

02:45:17.200 --> 02:45:19.080
then the game crashes.

02:45:19.080 --> 02:45:21.760
So that's how to do it, if you want to crash your game.

02:45:21.760 --> 02:45:23.920
So, just thought I'd share that with you.

02:45:23.920 --> 02:45:27.400
I know you're too busy playing WarioWare to give a shit, but I just thought I'd share.

02:45:27.400 --> 02:45:29.400
Nah, I heard her, brother.

02:45:57.400 --> 02:46:04.400
There's Pump Up The Volume on Tuesday night, although this week, I may not be able to do a show.

02:46:04.400 --> 02:46:07.400
It depends. If I do, I'll play a bunch of comedy.

02:46:07.400 --> 02:46:11.400
But usually I play whatever. If you're hanging out in the chat room, you can request whatever.

02:46:11.400 --> 02:46:14.400
It starts with a pre-show at a quarter to seven Pacific time.

02:46:14.400 --> 02:46:18.400
The show starts at 7.30 to 10.30, and it's really random every time.

02:46:18.400 --> 02:46:24.400
If you want to hear something new, unusual, something you might not normally listen to, check it out.

02:46:24.400 --> 02:46:34.060
Alright, sounds good. In the Groove, of course, since it made its recent debut on the PlayStation

02:46:34.060 --> 02:46:39.480
2, it's kind of getting some media coverage and some press coverage out there. One of

02:46:39.480 --> 02:46:43.760
the websites that actually covered it was Wired News, you know, Wired, the magazine,

02:46:43.760 --> 02:46:47.880
very respected tech magazine out there, actually did an article on In the Groove. If you're

02:46:47.880 --> 02:46:54.360
curious for the link, it's located on www.orangelaungeradio.com. It's on the front page, a link there.

02:46:54.360 --> 02:46:58.920
there to the Wired news story and it's kind of neat because it it compares the

02:46:58.920 --> 02:47:03.800
games DDR and in the groove and kind of talks about you know how the games are

02:47:03.800 --> 02:47:07.040
different it's kind of interesting because the only people that won't say

02:47:07.040 --> 02:47:11.920
that in the groove is kind of a loose adaptation of DDR or whatever is rock

02:47:11.920 --> 02:47:16.680
sore and red octane themselves they just kind of ignore it there but they post a

02:47:16.680 --> 02:47:18.840
nice review and that's kind of interesting that it actually gets

02:47:18.840 --> 02:47:25.840
coverage in Wired magazine. I like that. What are you giggling at over there, Loki?

02:47:25.840 --> 02:47:31.640
I was playing one level of the WarioWare and I got to like level 60 and the music got so

02:47:31.640 --> 02:47:38.040
fast it was funny. I was doing the hamster ED thing and that was fun. I'm glad you were

02:47:38.040 --> 02:47:42.220
able to do that. The only one I could probably rock at is the one where you have to hold

02:47:42.220 --> 02:47:49.220
it still, so you just leave your Game Boy Advance just sitting there.

02:47:49.220 --> 02:47:53.220
What if it requires you to have it at a certain angle?

02:47:53.220 --> 02:47:57.740
I don't think that's the case, but I'll try it.

02:47:57.740 --> 02:48:01.980
One other plug I want to get in regards to In the Groove stories, and I know we have

02:48:01.980 --> 02:48:05.420
a listener that writes for this website, and he actually wrote this review, so he'll like

02:48:05.420 --> 02:48:13.180
and I'm giving this a plug, but honestly, insidepulse.com, specifically games.insidepulse.com,

02:48:13.180 --> 02:48:17.640
they actually posted a review by one of our listeners, El Mullet, who writes for this

02:48:17.640 --> 02:48:25.420
website, did a review of In the Groove, and in my opinion, this freaking sums it up perfectly.

02:48:25.420 --> 02:48:31.620
This is honestly, like, the best review. This would be exactly how I feel about the game.

02:48:31.620 --> 02:48:36.180
I think there was one or two things I disagreed with, but it's almost 100% exactly how I feel

02:48:36.180 --> 02:48:37.180
about the game.

02:48:37.180 --> 02:48:38.180
And it's fair.

02:48:38.180 --> 02:48:41.660
It talks about what is good about In the Groove and what's not so good about In the Groove

02:48:41.660 --> 02:48:42.740
and all that.

02:48:42.740 --> 02:48:45.180
Check it out if you're curious insidepulse.com.

02:48:45.180 --> 02:48:46.260
I totally endorse it.

02:48:46.260 --> 02:48:48.260
I think it's a great review.

02:48:48.260 --> 02:48:51.740
Let's go and go to the Skype line because we actually just got a call on Skype.

02:48:51.740 --> 02:48:54.940
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:48:54.940 --> 02:48:57.140
This is your resident Ninja Spy Dark Knight.

02:48:57.140 --> 02:48:59.620
Hello, our Ninja Spy Dark Knight.

02:48:59.620 --> 02:49:01.620
What is on your mind tonight?

02:49:01.620 --> 02:49:03.620
Nothing much, just a little bit tired.

02:49:03.620 --> 02:49:08.620
Just got back from the convention around town this weekend.

02:49:08.620 --> 02:49:12.620
You sound a little drained, like you just went to a convention or something.

02:49:12.620 --> 02:49:15.620
You sound a little out of it, but that's alright. How was the convention?

02:49:15.620 --> 02:49:17.620
Oh, it was pretty good actually.

02:49:17.620 --> 02:49:20.620
I went to see the cosplay for the first time.

02:49:20.620 --> 02:49:23.620
There was a pretty interesting cosplay skit that was going on at the convention.

02:49:23.620 --> 02:49:25.620
Now which convention is this?

02:49:25.620 --> 02:49:27.620
Anime Mid-Atlantic.

02:49:27.620 --> 02:49:30.640
made in atlantic alright so what what kind of stuff where they do it at this

02:49:30.640 --> 02:49:34.380
convention or the big shows the big things to see

02:49:34.380 --> 02:49:37.880
uh... well i'd like that during the cosplay there was one skit they had they

02:49:37.880 --> 02:49:40.340
have one skit had on there which was like

02:49:40.340 --> 02:49:43.160
uh... final fantasy bit where they had

02:49:43.160 --> 02:49:47.020
a black mage a white mage and warrior fighting the tome berry

02:49:47.020 --> 02:49:49.080
and it was hilarious it was like

02:49:49.080 --> 02:49:50.840
of course a typical tome berry

02:49:50.840 --> 02:49:51.800
when you attack it

02:49:51.800 --> 02:49:54.860
it's almost impossible to get a single hit off of it

02:49:54.860 --> 02:49:58.420
and it was just getting hilarious every time it was killing everybody off and everybody like that

02:49:58.420 --> 02:49:59.160
at the end

02:49:59.160 --> 02:50:01.180
you see a guy come out holding a sign saying

02:50:01.180 --> 02:50:04.340
tom berry gains like five thousand experience

02:50:04.340 --> 02:50:08.580
five hundred forty gil and get pizza times four. Did the tom berry do the little final

02:50:08.580 --> 02:50:11.880
fantasy victory dance that they did in final fantasy where they just raise their arms

02:50:11.880 --> 02:50:14.540
up repeatedly? Yeah. Oh that's awesome. Yeah

02:50:14.540 --> 02:50:16.100
it was great

02:50:16.100 --> 02:50:17.740
but and there was one

02:50:17.740 --> 02:50:22.300
cosplay that was very that was really really good and

02:50:22.300 --> 02:50:27.660
beautifully performed. I wish I knew what it was, but let me put it this way, it involved

02:50:27.660 --> 02:50:33.620
a lot of people and flag waving displays, and it was beautifully done. And I don't know

02:50:33.620 --> 02:50:37.820
if it might have won or not, but apparently it was great.

02:50:37.820 --> 02:50:40.900
Maybe there'll be pictures on the internet at some point or something so you can share

02:50:40.900 --> 02:50:47.000
that with us later. Hey, I gotta ask, because no anime convention is incomplete without

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:50.300
a hentai room. Was there a hentai room?

02:50:50.300 --> 02:50:58.520
No, actually, unfortunately not, but yeah, when they had the raid portion, yeah, the

02:50:58.520 --> 02:51:02.360
emergency list kind of started piling up as the raid went on during the night.

02:51:02.360 --> 02:51:03.600
I see, I see.

02:51:03.600 --> 02:51:07.320
So anything else you want to share about the convention?

02:51:07.320 --> 02:51:12.160
Well, at the end of the convention, the last day was today, there was a big announcement

02:51:12.160 --> 02:51:14.760
about where they were going next year.

02:51:14.760 --> 02:51:19.380
Apparently they actually are going to go to they actually go to a big convention hall

02:51:19.940 --> 02:51:22.900
anime mid-atlantic next year will be at the Richmond Convention Center

02:51:23.420 --> 02:51:30.100
Okay, now no this now no, I think AMA is mostly like a local small con that's hosting a hotel

02:51:30.100 --> 02:51:35.720
But apparently it gotten so popular now that they decided on moving to the convention center, which is huge

02:51:35.720 --> 02:51:41.940
In fact when the announcement came down the whole audience erupted when I heard that announcement now

02:51:41.940 --> 02:51:47.440
Now I'm not very familiar with the mid-Atlantic landmarks, but I can imagine if you were doing

02:51:47.440 --> 02:51:50.840
your convention in a hotel lobby, and then someone said, hey, we're moving to the big

02:51:50.840 --> 02:51:51.840
convention center.

02:51:51.840 --> 02:51:53.780
That's pretty cool, because that lets you know you made it.

02:51:53.780 --> 02:51:55.160
So that's great.

02:51:55.160 --> 02:51:57.960
Good job.

02:51:57.960 --> 02:52:04.880
And now I'm hoping we might have good news that we might have a travel budget someday.

02:52:04.880 --> 02:52:08.920
So hopefully one of these days at least one of us will be able to come out there or something,

02:52:08.920 --> 02:52:09.920
do something.

02:52:09.920 --> 02:52:10.920
We'll see.

02:52:10.920 --> 02:52:15.320
It's a pretty cool convention. You meet some great guests.

02:52:15.320 --> 02:52:20.480
In fact, one of the most voiced artists is actually a local guy who you might have heard of.

02:52:20.480 --> 02:52:26.280
If you remember some of his shows, Greg Ayers actually comes to the convention every time and he's a local guy.

02:52:26.280 --> 02:52:28.000
And what's he known for?

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:33.720
He plays Son Goku in Sayuki, if I'm pronouncing that anime right.

02:52:33.720 --> 02:52:37.400
And he also does a whole bunch of stuff in ADV.

02:52:37.400 --> 02:52:41.220
most of all the big shows big enemies that they have out there he done our

02:52:41.220 --> 02:52:42.420
voice works for most of them

02:52:42.420 --> 02:52:46.700
you might have heard his voice once or twice on Evangelion maybe as well

02:52:46.700 --> 02:52:49.980
oh wow I try not to watch that Ava dubbed

02:52:49.980 --> 02:52:54.100
but he's like I said he's pretty good

02:52:54.100 --> 02:52:57.580
he's like one of the main people out of ADV

02:52:57.580 --> 02:53:00.620
and like I said it's a surprise who is it again?

02:53:00.620 --> 02:53:04.420
who was it again? Greg Ayers

02:53:04.420 --> 02:53:09.000
Okay, I don't know why for a moment. I had somebody else someone else's name stuck in my head

02:53:09.560 --> 02:53:13.960
But like I said, he's a local and like I said for him to blow up like that is great

02:53:13.960 --> 02:53:20.000
And to see a local guy actually succeed like that and it's really really cool. He's actually met him. He's really cool guy

02:53:20.280 --> 02:53:26.640
So like I said, I mean, I like it. I love his work and I hope he does a lot more. I'll say that way

02:53:27.160 --> 02:53:34.000
All right, very cool. Well, congratulations that the con was a big success and who knows hopefully we can come out to one of those

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:37.200
cons one of these days we'll see we gotta let you go cuz we're gonna get some

02:53:37.200 --> 02:53:40.660
ask orange lounge all right hold on I'm gonna throw a shameless plug in

02:53:40.660 --> 02:53:47.380
absolutely um on live 365 that con that convention actually now has a radio

02:53:47.380 --> 02:53:52.900
channel on um live 365 I will um I will um post the link on the forum if it is

02:53:52.900 --> 02:53:57.080
up on um on the chat room is that okay that's fine that's absolutely fine I'm

02:53:57.080 --> 02:54:00.120
all for supporting other life these five stations just don't forget about us

02:54:00.120 --> 02:54:05.120
that's all I ask. Oh, trust me, I won't. If you like anime and stuff, check it out.

02:54:05.120 --> 02:54:10.120
Sounds good, check it out then. I think internet radio is where it's at, so definitely listen to

02:54:10.120 --> 02:54:15.120
internet radio stations including us and Anime Mid-Atlantic and whatever tickles your

02:54:15.120 --> 02:54:20.120
fancy. Alright, y'all guys have a good night. Alright, you too. Have a good one.

02:54:20.120 --> 02:54:25.120
Just in case anyone out there is playing WarioWare Twisted, you want to know what it sounds like on level

02:54:25.120 --> 02:54:32.120
level 150

02:54:32.400 --> 02:54:35.760
that's lovely thank you i'm gonna come over there and shake that

02:54:35.760 --> 02:54:40.400
i'm playing the do not move one and it's so easy to win because you just

02:54:40.400 --> 02:54:44.080
to set it down and you know i actually got up to about i think it was like three

02:54:44.080 --> 02:54:45.800
hundred and fifty one

02:54:45.800 --> 02:54:49.800
and it was on uh... warrior where for the game cube and it was the metroid

02:54:49.800 --> 02:54:52.960
missile one all you had to do is hit the a button as fast as you can and shoot

02:54:52.960 --> 02:54:54.580
missiles to kill mother brain

02:54:54.580 --> 02:54:59.580
That was the minigame. For those of you guys that don't know WarioWare, it's just a bunch of minigames thrown together.

02:54:59.580 --> 02:55:04.580
So, that was the whole concept, so to speak, I guess.

02:55:04.580 --> 02:55:09.580
I got to, like, 350, and my fingers were practically starting to bleed,

02:55:09.580 --> 02:55:14.580
because I just was whacking that button so much. The button! The button!

02:55:16.580 --> 02:55:20.580
Let's go to some Ask Orange Lounge. We only got a few questions, that's alright, we don't have a lot of show left.

02:55:20.580 --> 02:55:28.300
Whoa! That's not the right theme music. That's the Ask... That's the Ask... That's wedding chat!

02:55:28.300 --> 02:55:37.100
That's the Ask Satan portion of the show. My bad, you guys. Sorry about that.

02:55:37.100 --> 02:55:45.300
Marriage Talk with Cal Dracula. Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid

02:55:45.300 --> 02:55:50.380
questions. What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio? It's a good

02:55:50.380 --> 02:55:56.060
thing it's just dark sakura sky and low oki and not satan or else the theme music would

02:55:56.060 --> 02:55:57.060
sound something like this

02:55:57.060 --> 02:56:07.620
let's get to the questions

02:56:07.620 --> 02:56:16.020
illusion wants to know in your guys opinions is gem truly truly truly outrageous

02:56:16.020 --> 02:56:20.340
truly truly truly outrageous

02:56:20.340 --> 02:56:24.060
well you know what and the misfits are bitter they're gonna get her

02:56:24.060 --> 02:56:27.500
with the misfits their songs are better and they're gonna get her

02:56:27.500 --> 02:56:31.620
the misfits were better people

02:56:31.620 --> 02:56:37.540
ah misty wants to know does it still count as a hentai room

02:56:37.540 --> 02:56:41.020
if it was only running from 2 to 7 a.m. on Saturday

02:56:41.020 --> 02:56:45.260
and Sunday when most of the little kitties are asleep

02:56:45.260 --> 02:56:48.580
It turns hentai and then changes back.

02:56:48.580 --> 02:56:54.460
I think it works for me.

02:56:54.460 --> 02:57:00.420
Hentai is hentai, people.

02:57:00.420 --> 02:57:03.580
That's the important thing to remember.

02:57:03.580 --> 02:57:05.200
Doobs wants to know...

02:57:05.200 --> 02:57:06.940
Oh, I'm sorry, that was his FU.

02:57:06.940 --> 02:57:10.940
Why does everyone hate Pump It Up slash In The Groove 2?

02:57:10.940 --> 02:57:12.300
I don't really think it's

02:57:12.300 --> 02:57:16.500
that bad of an idea. I'd like to play Pump It Up and In The Groove at the same time.

02:57:16.500 --> 02:57:20.380
Okay, let me clarify something for you though, because I think this is gonna be a

02:57:20.380 --> 02:57:21.620
common misconception.

02:57:21.620 --> 02:57:25.820
With Pump It Up and In The Groove 2, you will not be able to play both games

02:57:25.820 --> 02:57:30.380
at the same time. Think of it as a spin-off series, that basically In The

02:57:30.380 --> 02:57:32.780
Groove is being absorbed into the Pump It Up series.

02:57:32.780 --> 02:57:36.100
This does not mean that In The Groove will suddenly have five arrows or

02:57:36.100 --> 02:57:38.300
whatever, and I don't know if you were misinterpreting this,

02:57:38.300 --> 02:57:42.100
but I'm saying this in general for anybody who is thinking this way, just

02:57:42.100 --> 02:57:46.780
in general. It's not suddenly going to mean that In the Groove turns into a five-arrow

02:57:46.780 --> 02:57:50.760
dancing game. It doesn't mean any of that. It's just that it's a different game but they're

02:57:50.760 --> 02:57:56.680
putting it out under the Pump It Up label. Such as, you know, I don't know, I'm trying

02:57:56.680 --> 02:58:01.720
to think of a comparable example type thing. Whereas, you know, Diet Coke is not Coke but

02:58:01.720 --> 02:58:04.320
it's under the Coke label. Does that make sense at all?

02:58:04.320 --> 02:58:15.320
It's kind of like MTV2. See, MTV2 plays music videos, and MTV3 plays music videos, and MTV1 and 2.0.

02:58:15.320 --> 02:58:16.320
The Ocho.

02:58:18.320 --> 02:58:19.320
God, that is...

02:58:20.320 --> 02:58:23.320
Yeah, it's just about their, you know, partnership with Animaro.

02:58:23.320 --> 02:58:26.320
And they're actually going to get it in a good cabinet.

02:58:26.320 --> 02:58:29.320
And to answer the other part of the question, why does everyone hate Pump It Up and The Groove 2,

02:58:29.320 --> 02:58:34.320
I will defer that to Loki because he is the one that is most full of spite when it comes to those games, Loki.

02:58:34.320 --> 02:58:38.320
Because it sucks. The first game sucked, the second one is going to suck as well.

02:58:38.320 --> 02:58:40.320
What more do I need to ask?

02:58:40.320 --> 02:58:45.320
I'm going to be a little hopeful for the second one just because I really like the Pump It Up cabinets.

02:58:45.320 --> 02:58:53.320
Okay, we'll check out the brand new cabinets with their brand spanking new huge monitor.

02:58:53.320 --> 02:58:55.320
They'll be like, wow, ugly graphics, but bigger.

02:58:55.320 --> 02:59:00.320
Wait a minute. It sucks is the blandest description I've ever heard though. Why does it suck?

02:59:00.320 --> 02:59:03.320
Why does it suck? The graphics suck.

02:59:03.320 --> 02:59:08.320
Okay, the graphics are bland and horrible.

02:59:08.320 --> 02:59:11.320
The gameplay is just lame.

02:59:11.320 --> 02:59:16.320
It's basically, oh look, we copied DDR. It's a brand new game with really subpar graphics.

02:59:16.320 --> 02:59:20.320
The interface we spent like two seconds actually designing.

02:59:20.320 --> 02:59:24.320
You know, and the music, oh well, guess what, it sounds all the same.

02:59:24.320 --> 02:59:27.320
And, you know, our step charts are way too damn hard.

02:59:27.320 --> 02:59:28.320
How are you going to play them on a soft pad?

02:59:28.320 --> 02:59:30.320
But, Loki, there's 12 and 13 footers in it.

02:59:30.320 --> 02:59:32.320
Isn't that what the future of dance gaming is all about?

02:59:32.320 --> 02:59:34.320
Oh, yeah, try that on a soft pad.

02:59:34.320 --> 02:59:35.320
Yeah, yeah.

02:59:35.320 --> 02:59:36.320
I was just curious.

02:59:36.320 --> 02:59:38.320
Yeah, when you can't do, like, four footers on a soft pad,

02:59:38.320 --> 02:59:40.320
yeah, 13 feet, that's going to rock.

02:59:40.320 --> 02:59:42.320
Okay, yeah, well, that's where it's at.

02:59:42.320 --> 02:59:43.320
I'm sorry.

02:59:43.320 --> 02:59:46.320
All right.

02:59:46.320 --> 02:59:49.320
I'm still, I say, in the groove.

02:59:49.320 --> 02:59:52.320
It's not as good as the fanboys and girls say it is,

02:59:52.320 --> 02:59:59.160
it is, but it's not as bad as Loki says it is either, or the haters say. It's just, it's

02:59:59.160 --> 03:00:04.120
there. It's another dance game. It's fine. Whatever. For me it is kind of a holdover

03:00:04.120 --> 03:00:10.120
until New DDR, honestly, which I hope will happen in the arcade someday. But I'm not

03:00:10.120 --> 03:00:18.120
going to hold my breath. I hope. I hope those kinds of rumors are true. I really hope so.

03:00:18.120 --> 03:00:21.800
Anyway, that's the end of the show. It's time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts,

03:00:21.800 --> 03:00:26.720
Starting with Seagurd, Mieglatov, Shane, whatever the hell your name is.

03:00:26.720 --> 03:00:31.800
Taco Bell has a new food item that's really good.

03:00:31.800 --> 03:00:33.800
Loki.

03:00:33.800 --> 03:00:38.920
I don't eat at Taco Bell because, you know, it looks like runny poop

03:00:38.920 --> 03:00:40.720
and it gives you runny poop, so the end.

03:00:46.640 --> 03:00:49.160
My final thought is, I want a Power Max.

03:00:49.160 --> 03:00:50.880
Somebody give me $1,600.

03:00:50.880 --> 03:00:56.280
And Loki, don't you open your mouth. I don't want to get into this discussion with you.

03:00:56.280 --> 03:00:59.920
What exactly... What power would that have?

03:00:59.920 --> 03:01:03.880
The power to crash. The power to run nothing.

03:01:03.880 --> 03:01:06.400
The power to play no games.

03:01:06.400 --> 03:01:09.760
I actually want... I actually want a G5.

03:01:09.760 --> 03:01:13.080
Yeah. But I'm in the graphic art. I'm waiting for Loki to say something about,

03:01:13.080 --> 03:01:18.040
you know, Macintoshes are the in the groove of the computer market or something.

03:01:18.040 --> 03:01:25.280
I am actually thinking of saving up for a G5 tower, just because since my major is mostly

03:01:25.280 --> 03:01:26.280
graphic based.

03:01:26.280 --> 03:01:28.720
Look, look people, I want one because they're pretty, alright?

03:01:28.720 --> 03:01:29.720
That's it.

03:01:29.720 --> 03:01:30.720
I want one!

03:01:30.720 --> 03:01:33.000
I have a legitimate reason for wanting one!

03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:34.640
You want one for aesthetic value?

03:01:34.640 --> 03:01:37.640
No, I have real value for them.

03:01:37.640 --> 03:01:43.280
I like the idea that they do the sound, I want things like GarageBand and those types

03:01:43.280 --> 03:01:44.280
of programs.

03:01:44.280 --> 03:01:45.560
I think they could answer some.

03:01:45.560 --> 03:01:46.560
Yeah.

03:01:46.560 --> 03:01:49.560
I just want Photoshop to be able to run decently.

03:01:49.560 --> 03:01:55.560
And honestly, my work comes out a lot better using the G5 at school than using my PC.

03:01:55.560 --> 03:01:58.560
Alright, DarkSakura, your final thought?

03:01:58.560 --> 03:02:00.560
Reject false icons!

03:02:00.560 --> 03:02:02.560
So that Britney Spears is on fire!

03:02:02.560 --> 03:02:07.560
And the final word of the show, one word to sum everything up and let us know where we...

03:02:07.560 --> 03:02:09.560
I gave it to you last week, didn't I, Seacred?

03:02:09.560 --> 03:02:11.560
Alright, fine, you can have tonight's final word.

03:02:11.560 --> 03:02:14.560
See you guys next week, thanks for listening, you guys.

03:02:14.560 --> 03:02:19.560
And the final word of the show is hungry.

03:02:19.560 --> 03:02:25.120
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

03:02:25.120 --> 03:02:30.040

And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

03:02:43.760 --> 03:03:07.920
Now you say you never met my wife, you ain't never seen her before

03:03:07.920 --> 03:03:12.800
Say you ain't been hangin' round my crib, well here's somethin' I wanna know

03:03:12.800 --> 03:03:20.680
I wanna know what in the world is goin' down How come my dog don't bark when you come around?

03:03:20.680 --> 03:03:27.520
I got the baddest dog, he'll bite anybody He bit my little brother, took a chunk out

03:03:27.520 --> 03:03:33.680
of my old sweet little mother He bit the mailman, he sees him every day

03:03:33.680 --> 03:03:38.240
He takes one look at you, he wanna jump up and play

03:03:38.240 --> 03:03:42.240
Now I ain't got a clue as to what you puttin' down

03:03:42.240 --> 03:03:47.240
But I come my dog, don't balk when you come around

03:03:47.240 --> 03:03:52.240
My dog is dangerous, tryin' to set people free

03:03:52.240 --> 03:03:56.240
Even bought a bad dog's fine and hung it on the gate

03:03:56.240 --> 03:04:00.240
Here you come trippin' about a quarter to nine

03:04:00.240 --> 03:04:05.240
Full of that nitrene wine tryin' to slide past the slide

03:04:05.240 --> 03:04:09.240
My dog there knockin' off ain't read you no mind

03:04:09.240 --> 03:04:14.240
That's my dog when I come home, he don't sleep that sound

03:04:14.240 --> 03:04:18.240
How come my dog don't bark when you come around?

03:04:18.240 --> 03:04:22.240
I still don't like it, I don't dig it one damn bit

03:04:22.240 --> 03:04:26.240
The way you and my dog are so tight, somethin' don't fit

03:04:26.240 --> 03:04:30.240
Now I slip through the alley, I call my dog

03:04:30.240 --> 03:04:36.240
So get up off your rusty dust Move a little faster to your old master

03:04:36.240 --> 03:04:40.240
Your Kai Yu Yu He took one look at me

03:04:40.240 --> 03:04:50.240
He growled and he ran straight to you Now somebody's been confusing my whole hound

03:04:50.240 --> 03:04:58.240
And I wanna know what's goin' down How come my dog don't bark when you come around?

03:05:07.240 --> 03:05:15.240
Maybe I better call up Jacoby and Miles And you can take the Fifth Amendment, that is

03:05:15.240 --> 03:05:21.240
Better stand up for your rights, cause you might not be standing too long

03:05:21.240 --> 03:05:28.240
I'm gonna stop all this confusion, I'm gonna fire that hound, shoot that dog down

03:05:28.240 --> 03:05:36.240
Then I'm gonna get busy mutilating, strangling, operating, and cremating my old lady

03:05:36.240 --> 03:05:39.240
Down at the cremation station

03:05:39.240 --> 03:05:43.240
Then I'm gonna torch that tooth and come right on after you

03:05:43.240 --> 03:05:50.240
You'd give your heart and soul to charity And all the rest's gonna be a loan to me

03:05:50.240 --> 03:05:54.240
I'm goin' straight down to that barber's supply shop

03:05:54.240 --> 03:05:59.240
Gettin' a girl handy, double edged, high on the ground

03:05:59.240 --> 03:06:08.240
Move a blue blade, adjustable stainless steel Horned edge, both blades on the same side

03:06:08.240 --> 03:06:12.240
So when I cut you once, you gonna bleed twice

03:06:12.240 --> 03:06:21.240
And if you don't believe me, shake your head, it'll be singin' I ain't got no vibe.

03:06:21.240 --> 03:06:27.240
But one night I hit a little FBI 007 type investigation.

03:06:27.240 --> 03:06:31.240
You and my old lady thought I was gone, but I wasn't gone.

03:06:31.240 --> 03:06:35.240
That's why I had to separate you from your ground.

03:06:35.240 --> 03:06:41.240
And the only sound you gonna hear when you six feet in the ground.

03:06:41.240 --> 03:06:54.040
How come my dog didn't bark when you came around?

03:06:54.040 --> 03:07:01.040
Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.

03:07:24.040 --> 03:07:36.200
There we are. There's Mike. Alright. Rob, how come my cat don't meow when you come around?

03:07:36.200 --> 03:07:42.160
I don't know honey, I don't know. Alright. Um, Loki, I promised the chatters I'd bring

03:07:42.160 --> 03:07:45.640
this up to you because they started yelling this at me during the credits, but some folks

03:07:45.640 --> 03:07:49.720
in the chat room say they can pass 11 footers on their home pads. And they're yelling at

03:07:49.720 --> 03:07:56.080
saying you you suck to loki you are to suck we can pass yeah but what about

03:07:56.080 --> 03:08:03.320
soft pads no there that somebody said my soft pad is modded on top of a plastic

03:08:03.320 --> 03:08:09.160
card modded I'm sorry do it on an unmodded one and send us footage what

03:08:09.160 --> 03:08:13.000
well what's that gonna prove us let's assume somewhere somebody has done it

03:08:13.000 --> 03:08:17.760
let's say what is that gonna prove no one can no one can do it on an unmodded

03:08:17.760 --> 03:08:22.760
I think there's just no pleasing Loki, kids. That's just how it works. So, that's the best answer you're gonna get.

03:08:22.760 --> 03:08:28.560
regular soft pad no what serious gamer plays on a regular soft pad though that's

03:08:28.560 --> 03:08:32.440
what they sell them so that's what I did I haven't modded any of my pads yet then

03:08:32.440 --> 03:08:36.800
again I did pay $80 for my Dreamcast ones all right all right there's just I

03:08:36.800 --> 03:08:41.800
think there's just no pleasing Loki kids that's just how it works so that's the

03:08:41.800 --> 03:08:45.320
best answer you're gonna get in the meantime we're signing out for the night

03:08:45.320 --> 03:08:47.320
Thanks a lot for
