05:01.495 --> 05:02.536
[SPEAKER_16]: You were just drawn that way?

05:02.756 --> 05:03.376
[SPEAKER_19]: Today I was.

05:04.056 --> 05:04.516
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry to hear that.

05:04.556 --> 05:10.059
[SPEAKER_19]: I left the real me at home because she's currently packing up her entire life to the boonies of Citrus Heights.

[SPEAKER_19]: I'm moving into a house for renting.

05:18.993 --> 05:19.333
[SPEAKER_16]: Fun!

05:19.854 --> 05:20.274
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.

05:20.434 --> 05:21.215
[SPEAKER_16]: I know what that's like.

05:21.455 --> 05:21.875
[SPEAKER_16]: Kinda.

05:21.935 --> 05:22.196
[SPEAKER_16]: Sort of.

05:23.276 --> 05:25.138
[SPEAKER_16]: Just recently, as we moved in the new studio.

05:25.318 --> 05:25.558
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway.

05:26.099 --> 05:29.041
[SPEAKER_16]: Also joining us, the recently moved Loki!

05:29.601 --> 05:29.862
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi.

05:30.891 --> 05:31.611
[SPEAKER_16]: I just moved.

05:32.292 --> 05:33.892
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, like, to the side.

05:34.232 --> 05:36.213
[SPEAKER_16]: You moved from the living room to the studio.

05:36.233 --> 05:37.013
[SPEAKER_16]: It was very nice.

05:37.094 --> 05:40.615
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, unfortunately I didn't move to the Pizza Hut to get myself dinner.

05:40.795 --> 05:42.336
[SPEAKER_15]: I knew something was missing.

05:43.056 --> 05:45.337
[SPEAKER_15]: I forgot, so I'm hungry now.

05:45.537 --> 05:46.357
[SPEAKER_15]: How could you forget pizza?

05:46.417 --> 05:46.777
[SPEAKER_19]: I have a salad.

05:46.797 --> 05:47.498
[SPEAKER_19]: How could you forget pizza?

05:47.518 --> 05:48.678
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, no, I don't eat salad.

05:48.878 --> 05:49.418
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

05:49.839 --> 05:51.319
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a meatitarian, okay?

05:51.359 --> 05:52.660
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't touch that friggin' vegetables.

05:52.680 --> 05:53.400
[SPEAKER_19]: For salad, it has bacon bits.

05:53.700 --> 05:54.761
[SPEAKER_19]: It has bacon and chicken in it.

05:55.181 --> 05:56.701
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, but the bacon bits aren't real.

05:56.941 --> 05:58.122
[SPEAKER_19]: They aren't real bacon!

05:58.894 --> 06:00.536
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm eating this because my doctor told me to.

06:00.556 --> 06:03.800
[SPEAKER_15]: My doctor could tell me to eat salad all he wants and I'd be just like...

06:20.276 --> 06:27.401
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, but I don't want to be one of those 300-pound women that walk around in a muumuu scratching their ass in the middle of Walmart with five screaming children.

06:27.702 --> 06:28.843
[SPEAKER_16]: Dude, I saw that the other day.

06:29.843 --> 06:30.444
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.

06:30.864 --> 06:32.025
[SPEAKER_19]: That's not going to be me.

06:32.065 --> 06:34.207
[SPEAKER_19]: What are you doing in Walmart?

06:36.428 --> 06:37.829
[SPEAKER_16]: Just don't go to Walmart, Jamie.

06:39.270 --> 06:41.032
[SPEAKER_19]: But I don't want to wear the tent either.

06:42.253 --> 06:46.496
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, those women are the ones that shop for G-strings and shit, you know.

06:48.486 --> 06:50.188
[SPEAKER_16]: Go to work at a Walmart.

06:50.208 --> 06:50.308
[SPEAKER_15]: Never.

06:50.328 --> 06:50.588
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

06:50.628 --> 06:51.709
[SPEAKER_15]: And he's not traumatized?

06:51.729 --> 06:54.071
[SPEAKER_16]: I just bit through my fork a moment ago.

06:54.091 --> 06:54.451
[SPEAKER_16]: It's crazy.

06:54.471 --> 06:55.291
[SPEAKER_16]: Look at my fork.

06:55.371 --> 06:55.592
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway.

07:09.987 --> 07:17.212
[SPEAKER_16]: Moving on, special guest, say hello to, I never know what he wants to be called, but he's back here this week, Sigurd Miklatov.

07:17.412 --> 07:17.832
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi.

07:18.073 --> 07:18.413
[SPEAKER_16]: Whatever.

07:18.733 --> 07:19.193
[SPEAKER_16]: How you doing?

07:19.513 --> 07:21.054
[SPEAKER_14]: Good, playing Mario DS.

07:21.315 --> 07:23.176
[SPEAKER_14]: So, can you tell us anything new about the games yet?

07:23.876 --> 07:25.938
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, Viazoic is in Ultimate 3.

07:25.998 --> 07:26.678
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, great, thanks.

07:26.758 --> 07:28.279
[SPEAKER_14]: We were already going to get to that tonight.

07:29.340 --> 07:29.680
[SPEAKER_14]: Oops.

07:30.200 --> 07:33.162
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, if you told us last week, then it would have been an exclusive.

07:33.563 --> 07:35.764
[SPEAKER_16]: NDA, I can't tell you anything.

07:35.784 --> 07:36.845
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, Spray last week.

07:37.385 --> 07:38.266
[SPEAKER_14]: Azoic This Week.

07:38.386 --> 07:40.808
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, but you didn't tell us the spray thing.

07:40.848 --> 07:42.330
[SPEAKER_16]: Spray told us the spray thing.

07:42.550 --> 07:44.531
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, well, I was going to tell it too.

07:45.212 --> 07:45.853
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure you were.

07:47.754 --> 07:48.055
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

07:49.135 --> 07:55.581
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, Sigurd may say something tonight, but I don't know, he looks too enthralled with whatever he's playing on his brand new blue DS.

07:56.502 --> 07:57.082
[SPEAKER_16]: What are you playing?

07:57.543 --> 08:00.646
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm playing the crappy, actually the fun mini-games of Mario.

08:00.966 --> 08:01.046
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh.

08:01.522 --> 08:25.699
[SPEAKER_16]: Secret, by the way, for those of our folks who are new listeners to the show, he actually works at the Big K, Konami, and therefore, on one hand, it's really great to have him on the show, because, hey, who better to talk about DDR than somebody who works on DDR, but on the other hand, he can't tell a shit about DDR, because if they find out, you know, with the feds listening to the show and all, they'll find him and they'll beat him up, right?

08:26.570 --> 08:27.130
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that what happens?

08:27.390 --> 08:27.971
[SPEAKER_16]: Something like that.

08:27.991 --> 08:29.551
[SPEAKER_16]: What happens to people that violate NDAs?

08:30.112 --> 08:31.552
[SPEAKER_16]: Or would that be a violation of the NDAs?

08:31.592 --> 08:32.853
[SPEAKER_19]: They in turn become violated.

08:35.314 --> 08:37.055
[SPEAKER_14]: It's something like that, unfortunately.

08:37.495 --> 08:37.655
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh.

08:38.535 --> 08:39.596
[SPEAKER_14]: That sounds kind of exciting.

08:39.616 --> 08:41.817
[SPEAKER_19]: They're beaten by Simon Belmont's whip.

08:42.057 --> 08:42.357
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

08:42.597 --> 08:43.798
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, let's get to a break.

08:43.858 --> 08:47.820
[SPEAKER_16]: We will go to a break and come back with a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.

08:48.440 --> 08:54.382
[SPEAKER_16]: The Azoic song we'll play for you guys tonight, as well as whatever else tickles our fancy.

08:54.503 --> 08:55.303
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, how about this?

08:57.459 --> 09:01.044
[SPEAKER_16]: I always thought this was funny because you work at Konami yet you're a huge Pump It Up fan.

09:01.564 --> 09:02.886
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's not talk about that.

09:02.946 --> 09:04.709
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, we're talking about it after this.

09:04.769 --> 09:08.474
[SPEAKER_16]: In this break, some old school DDR songs we haven't played in a while.

09:08.494 --> 09:09.396
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll be back after this.

09:11.704 --> 09:13.485
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you ready?

09:13.505 --> 09:14.426
[SPEAKER_08]: Ready for the race?

09:14.606 --> 09:15.746
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you ready?

09:16.707 --> 09:18.248
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh!

09:18.408 --> 09:19.368
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you ready?

09:19.408 --> 09:21.469
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh!

09:21.549 --> 09:22.450
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you ready?

09:23.010 --> 09:27.092
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we'll go round and round You hear the way you hear

10:06.840 --> 10:07.263
Thank you.

10:33.364 --> 10:34.348
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you ready?

10:34.589 --> 10:36.496
Ready for the race?

10:36.717 --> 10:37.259
Are you ready?

12:05.229 --> 12:07.311
If you can't say goodbye

13:09.831 --> 13:10.899
Thank you for watching!

14:24.614 --> 14:25.896
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to step on the lamina.

14:25.916 --> 14:28.901
[SPEAKER_08]: Give us a reading on the 1202 programming.

15:24.790 --> 15:27.994
[SPEAKER_17]: After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move Marathon.

15:28.294 --> 15:30.357
[SPEAKER_08]: No!

15:30.557 --> 15:31.218
[SPEAKER_17]: Just kidding.

15:31.639 --> 15:32.700
[SPEAKER_16]: Orange Lounge Radio.

15:32.780 --> 15:34.302
[SPEAKER_16]: Crap-free Bavani Radio.

15:35.166 --> 15:36.987
[SPEAKER_16]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

15:37.007 --> 15:39.109
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you guys for tuning in tonight and listening to us.

15:39.989 --> 15:42.251
[SPEAKER_16]: In that break, you heard Ecstasy from Fifth Mix.

15:42.291 --> 15:45.353
[SPEAKER_16]: Before that, from Third Mix, if you can say goodbye by the Cape Project.

15:45.833 --> 15:48.255
[SPEAKER_16]: And before that, the Olivia Project with Xanadu.

15:48.695 --> 15:50.957
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't realize I kind of put him that way, but that's all right.

15:51.217 --> 15:53.198
[SPEAKER_16]: And then starting that set off, a little bit of the Captain.

15:53.499 --> 15:55.720
[SPEAKER_16]: Captain Jack with The Race, also from Third Mix.

15:55.880 --> 15:58.502
[SPEAKER_16]: So a lot of Third Mix in that break, but hey, that's all right.

15:58.542 --> 15:59.242
[SPEAKER_16]: Third Mix rocked.

15:59.363 --> 15:59.823
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, Third Mix...

16:00.771 --> 16:03.333
[SPEAKER_16]: Third Mix was kind of the peak of DDR in many ways.

16:03.393 --> 16:08.477
[SPEAKER_16]: At least a lot of folks that talk about the Japanese history of the game say it really peaked with Third Mix.

16:08.557 --> 16:11.819
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't know, song list wise, I think Third Mix is one of the best.

16:11.839 --> 16:12.400
[SPEAKER_16]: It really is.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.121
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm thinking it's all about Fourth Plus.

16:14.822 --> 16:16.363
[SPEAKER_16]: Fourth Plus was pretty rad.

16:16.383 --> 16:18.244
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I think that would be kind of like the peak.

16:18.264 --> 16:19.905
[SPEAKER_16]: But everybody has their own argument.

16:19.925 --> 16:22.287
[SPEAKER_16]: And then there's people that say, no, no, no, Extreme's got the best.

16:22.327 --> 16:23.168
[SPEAKER_16]: No, no, no, no.

16:23.688 --> 16:24.649
[SPEAKER_16]: Second Mix for life.

16:24.729 --> 16:25.069
[SPEAKER_16]: Whatever.

16:25.810 --> 16:26.450
[SPEAKER_16]: Step Battle.

16:26.490 --> 16:27.911
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, it's all about Step Battle.

16:27.931 --> 16:28.752
[SPEAKER_16]: Step Battle, yo.

16:28.772 --> 16:29.292
[SPEAKER_19]: I miss Step Battle.

16:29.312 --> 16:29.813
[SPEAKER_19]: Step Battle.

16:31.263 --> 16:31.543
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

16:31.563 --> 16:33.124
[SPEAKER_19]: But I can play it at home on my Dreamcast.

16:33.144 --> 16:35.804
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, Sigurd, tell them to put Step Battle back in DDR.

16:36.425 --> 16:36.925
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you do that?

16:37.245 --> 16:38.045
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll get right on that.

16:38.065 --> 16:41.126
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I know you actually write the games from scratch yourself.

16:43.407 --> 16:44.627
[SPEAKER_14]: With a pencil and paper.

16:47.288 --> 16:49.929
[SPEAKER_14]: And I put it on the CD and I kind of scroll it down.

16:49.949 --> 16:51.490
[SPEAKER_19]: That's real hand coding there.

16:52.170 --> 16:55.071
[SPEAKER_19]: Writing down the code and feeding it into a machine.

16:55.091 --> 16:55.551
[SPEAKER_19]: There you go.

16:55.811 --> 16:56.611
[SPEAKER_19]: In pencil.

16:56.691 --> 16:58.612
[SPEAKER_19]: And number two pencil on Scantron.

17:00.426 --> 17:02.308
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that how you guys do your dance steps?

17:02.368 --> 17:03.269
[SPEAKER_16]: It's on Scantron?

17:04.930 --> 17:08.453
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but we actually use a blue ink pen instead of a number two.

17:08.893 --> 17:09.093
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you?

17:09.233 --> 17:10.014
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, do you really?

17:10.034 --> 17:12.596
[SPEAKER_16]: No, you don't.

17:12.816 --> 17:13.076
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you?

17:13.256 --> 17:13.617
[SPEAKER_14]: No, we don't.

17:13.717 --> 17:14.117
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay.

17:14.237 --> 17:15.438
[SPEAKER_16]: I was going to say, wait a minute.

17:15.458 --> 17:16.058
[SPEAKER_16]: No, you don't.

17:18.480 --> 17:20.742
[SPEAKER_16]: Stop sounding serious during segments like that.

17:20.842 --> 17:21.323
[SPEAKER_16]: Fine.

17:21.603 --> 17:21.823
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

17:23.305 --> 17:24.766
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, anyway.

17:24.846 --> 17:27.889
[SPEAKER_16]: Here we are with another edition of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

17:28.150 --> 17:31.793
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I noticed that we kind of had a hit in listeners lately.

17:31.853 --> 17:38.759
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if it's maybe it's summertime, so some of the folks that were listening to us in college dorms just decided to say, see ya, and aren't going to listen to the show anymore.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.161
[SPEAKER_16]: I noticed there's been quite a bit of a drop in listeners.

17:42.201 --> 17:43.541
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me put it in perspective for you guys.

17:43.901 --> 17:51.764
[SPEAKER_16]: About two months ago, at this time, we were at, our station as a whole was at 3,900 listening hours, as we say.

17:51.824 --> 17:57.146
[SPEAKER_16]: So that means 3,900 people listened for one hour each, or some people listened more or less.

17:57.486 --> 17:58.266
[SPEAKER_16]: It evens out to that.

17:58.806 --> 18:02.087
[SPEAKER_16]: Right now, we're looking at 2,700 listening hours.

18:02.127 --> 18:03.988
[SPEAKER_16]: We're taking a hit of almost a third of our listeners.

18:04.988 --> 18:06.489
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm trying to think of why that is.

18:06.569 --> 18:07.429
[SPEAKER_16]: If it's because...

18:08.257 --> 18:16.043
[SPEAKER_16]: Just summertime blahs or the fact that we had that live 365 award thing earlier or if you just don't love us anymore.

18:17.164 --> 18:17.624
[SPEAKER_19]: That's it.

18:17.744 --> 18:19.506
[SPEAKER_19]: We need to start selling off Loki's stuff.

18:20.166 --> 18:20.947
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a good idea.

18:21.908 --> 18:22.508
[SPEAKER_19]: Put it on eBay.

18:23.429 --> 18:26.971
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I think actually maybe what part of it is is that, you know, we had a bunch of weeknight shows.

18:27.011 --> 18:27.852
[SPEAKER_16]: Now we only have one.

18:27.872 --> 18:30.274
[SPEAKER_19]: We can sell Loki as a virtual boyfriend on eBay.

18:32.396 --> 18:34.017
[SPEAKER_16]: Nelly might have issues with that, his fiance.

18:34.117 --> 18:34.817
[SPEAKER_19]: But it's virtual.

18:35.218 --> 18:35.678
[SPEAKER_19]: Like the chi.

18:39.420 --> 18:39.740
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

18:39.760 --> 18:40.461
[SPEAKER_19]: This was on eBay.

18:43.084 --> 18:43.604
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't know.

18:43.784 --> 18:46.387
[SPEAKER_16]: I think part of that might be because we don't have as much weeknight programming.

18:46.427 --> 18:51.612
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course, the lovely DarkSakura, being the trooper she is, still has her Tuesday night show, and I hope you all are listening because it's very nice.

18:52.313 --> 18:53.214
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a nice program.

18:53.554 --> 18:54.835
[SPEAKER_16]: I have a few people.

18:55.376 --> 18:58.219
[SPEAKER_16]: It's something the whole family can sit around the computer and really enjoy.

18:58.639 --> 19:01.182
[SPEAKER_19]: Sure, if they want to hear, Hi, Dad, I'm in jail.

19:01.983 --> 19:02.984
[SPEAKER_19]: I like it here.

19:05.086 --> 19:07.667
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, so, but no, we're going to remedy that.

19:07.707 --> 19:09.288
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a brand new show.

19:10.708 --> 19:14.450
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know how much I want to say about it yet because it's not done, but we're going to have a lunchtime show.

19:14.710 --> 19:21.874
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're going to have programming in the daytime, which should be very interesting, but it's going to be something that plays for like a half hour every Monday through Friday.

19:23.014 --> 19:24.215
[SPEAKER_16]: And what it is, I can't tell you yet.

19:25.343 --> 19:27.263
[SPEAKER_16]: It's going to be very cool.

19:27.644 --> 19:32.184
[SPEAKER_16]: I love the idea, partially because I've worked so hard on it, but I think it really is a good idea.

19:32.445 --> 19:33.065
[SPEAKER_16]: So you'll have that.

19:33.165 --> 19:38.826
[SPEAKER_16]: And of course, also we had some posts on the forums this week on the OrangeLaunchRadio.com site on the forums.

19:39.046 --> 19:41.806
[SPEAKER_16]: Some folks wanted to know, what happened to Outside the Box?

19:42.106 --> 19:54.869
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, unfortunately due to real life and people having jobs, especially at employers that can't seem to give them regular schedules, etc., etc., we kind of had to put Outside the Box on the back burner for a while.

19:55.535 --> 19:57.316
[SPEAKER_16]: A ticket to help me move?

20:25.212 --> 20:26.253
[SPEAKER_16]: You can drive the truck.

20:26.273 --> 20:27.534
[SPEAKER_16]: You're going to be moving next Sunday.

20:27.554 --> 20:29.295
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll let you drive the U-Haul.

20:29.335 --> 20:30.816
[SPEAKER_16]: You do not want me driving the U-Haul.

20:30.856 --> 20:32.277
[SPEAKER_16]: That is some scary shit right there.

20:32.458 --> 20:33.619
[SPEAKER_16]: I cannot drive U-Hauls.

20:34.259 --> 20:35.840
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you don't want me doing that.

20:37.370 --> 20:41.072
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, next Sunday, June the 26th, is my actual birthday birthday.

20:41.412 --> 20:48.055
[SPEAKER_16]: And because DarkSakura is moving and because I have my birthday, we are not going to have a live show that night, I don't think.

20:48.435 --> 20:48.715
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

20:49.136 --> 20:49.956
[SPEAKER_16]: No live show that night.

20:49.996 --> 20:51.957
[SPEAKER_16]: But we will have something else in our place.

20:52.617 --> 21:01.161
[SPEAKER_16]: And then, but in two weeks, when we come back July 3rd, huge show because it's our three-year anniversary, if you can believe it.

21:01.261 --> 21:02.682
[SPEAKER_16]: Three years of doing this crap.

21:03.783 --> 21:06.364
[SPEAKER_16]: Three years, three studios, three hosts.

21:06.943 --> 21:08.285
[SPEAKER_16]: Three migraines every week.

21:10.128 --> 21:11.410
[SPEAKER_19]: All kinds of aches and pains.

21:11.550 --> 21:13.312
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, so we've got that to look forward to.

21:13.352 --> 21:14.314
[SPEAKER_19]: Torture, torture.

21:16.604 --> 21:16.864
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura

21:45.888 --> 21:52.356
[SPEAKER_19]: My week has been just work and moving and lots and lots of pain.

21:54.958 --> 21:55.439
[SPEAKER_16]: Not the band.

21:55.879 --> 21:57.121
[SPEAKER_19]: No, but they're a good band.

21:58.835 --> 22:03.218
[SPEAKER_19]: But I've been having a flare-up from my car accident.

22:04.819 --> 22:27.875
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm having some pretty bad muscle spasms around my right hip, so I scheduled myself an appointment to see the doctor, who gave me more lovely Vicodin, a new muscle relaxer called Robaxin, I think is what it's called, something like that, and more ibuprofen, lots and lots of lovely refills of everything, and then also told me that the reason why I'm...

22:28.835 --> 22:33.359
[SPEAKER_19]: Having other pain is because my diet is hurting my digestion.

22:34.040 --> 22:36.842
[SPEAKER_19]: So I get to completely change how I'm eating, which is a lot of fun.

22:37.582 --> 22:39.924
[SPEAKER_19]: So yeah, salad.

22:43.487 --> 22:45.569
[SPEAKER_19]: Other than that, I've been doing nothing but moving.

22:45.669 --> 22:54.897
[SPEAKER_19]: I haven't played any games really, except for a couple of the games on the Guerrilla site before I found out that we're actually moving next weekend and not the weekend after.

22:56.257 --> 22:56.437
[SPEAKER_16]: WTF?

22:56.457 --> 22:56.577
[SPEAKER_16]: WTF?

23:15.117 --> 23:17.839
[SPEAKER_19]: I found one of my old RPG journals from when I played D&D.

23:17.859 --> 23:19.380
[SPEAKER_19]: It was great.

23:19.841 --> 23:21.522
[SPEAKER_19]: Found old character sheets, lots of old nerdy crap.

23:44.656 --> 23:46.998
[SPEAKER_19]: D20s I also did find my sketchbook from 1996

24:03.070 --> 24:04.852
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to take you back!

24:22.326 --> 24:25.987
[SPEAKER_19]: So, um, maybe those will find their way onto the internet.

24:26.287 --> 24:30.128
[SPEAKER_19]: Because actually, I look a lot better now than I did then.

24:31.008 --> 24:34.108
[SPEAKER_19]: Because my first year here, I put on like 10 pounds right away.

24:35.469 --> 24:36.569
[SPEAKER_16]: California will do that to you.

24:37.529 --> 24:38.749
[SPEAKER_19]: Either that or make you anorexic.

24:39.970 --> 24:41.150
[SPEAKER_16]: It's either one extreme or the other.

24:41.550 --> 24:42.930
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, but that's it for me.

24:43.770 --> 24:44.871
[SPEAKER_19]: Other than, I hate dust!

24:47.431 --> 24:48.571
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, uh, moving on.

24:48.631 --> 24:49.031
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki!

24:49.792 --> 24:50.792
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, how was your week?

24:50.812 --> 24:51.212
[SPEAKER_16]: How was your day?

24:51.412 --> 24:51.592
[SPEAKER_16]: Huh?

24:52.589 --> 24:54.692
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, yeah, we do a show here, remember?

24:56.333 --> 24:56.814
[SPEAKER_15]: That's right.

24:58.176 --> 24:59.437
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, let's see what I do this week.

25:00.658 --> 25:11.511
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, finally, my purchase of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas has finished, so I was able to play my game, legally.

25:12.212 --> 25:12.712
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um...

25:13.593 --> 25:16.736
[SPEAKER_15]: So, it was quite interesting because I was trying out every single mod.

25:16.777 --> 25:18.438
[SPEAKER_15]: Did the credit card get held up?

25:18.498 --> 25:20.541
[SPEAKER_15]: What exactly slowed this down?

25:20.781 --> 25:29.871
[SPEAKER_15]: You have to understand, you see, that, you know, when you're shipping stuff, sometimes, you know, the truck breaks down or whatnot.

25:29.991 --> 25:30.371
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

25:30.611 --> 25:32.794
[SPEAKER_15]: But over the internet, sometimes... Or when you're in a queue...

25:34.881 --> 25:45.149
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, I know, they just, for some reason, you know, the last bit of the game just, you know, wouldn't ship, or wasn't ready to ship right away for like about a week, you know, I guess with a manual or a sticker or something.

25:45.769 --> 25:50.953
[SPEAKER_15]: So I had to wait for a while for it to get done shipping, and then I was ready to go to play my brand new game.

25:51.134 --> 25:57.278
[SPEAKER_15]: And so anyways, the graphics are awesome, and I got to actually try out some of the mods in it, so...

25:58.439 --> 25:59.820
[SPEAKER_15]: What was the first thing you did?

26:00.220 --> 26:06.943
[SPEAKER_15]: I modded the Trash Master to be super fast and handle like crazy, so that was fun.

26:06.983 --> 26:19.348
[SPEAKER_15]: And then for some reason I did this code where it says become a slut magnet, and so I put it in, and for some reason I was in the gimp outfit with the dildo and my army of sluts following me, so that was interesting.

26:19.908 --> 26:22.569
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, um, what else?

26:22.589 --> 26:24.330
[SPEAKER_15]: Remind me to save that clip for the next intro.

26:24.890 --> 26:34.938
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

26:49.509 --> 26:52.513
[SPEAKER_15]: After playing around with the game some, um, what was it?

26:52.853 --> 27:03.985
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, the only thing that pissed me off about the game is the controls in it, because you have to kind of use the mouse and keyboard, and I hate that, because I don't play first-person shooters, so I don't like the mouse-keyboard thing.

27:04.126 --> 27:08.751
[SPEAKER_15]: I like, you know, just one thing and be done with it, but...

27:09.702 --> 27:10.082
[SPEAKER_15]: and so on.

27:26.992 --> 27:28.254
[SPEAKER_15]: Make her pawn it.

27:43.132 --> 27:44.312
[SPEAKER_15]: And how many rings do you get?

27:44.512 --> 27:45.233
[SPEAKER_15]: I get one.

28:07.499 --> 28:08.100
[SPEAKER_15]: One stupid ring.

28:08.120 --> 28:08.740
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

28:09.521 --> 28:10.501
[SPEAKER_15]: She's paying for that ring.

28:10.521 --> 28:11.102
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, that's nice.

28:11.262 --> 28:13.023
[SPEAKER_15]: But I have to pay for the other three, okay?

28:14.064 --> 28:14.584
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what?

28:14.904 --> 28:17.106
[SPEAKER_19]: I think this whole wedding ring business is retarded.

28:17.946 --> 28:23.830
[SPEAKER_19]: Because the only reason that... See, Dan and I are having one each, and we're having them custom-made to match.

28:24.611 --> 28:25.752
[SPEAKER_19]: Together, the price is $650.

28:25.912 --> 28:30.295
[SPEAKER_19]: Damn straight, that's what I'm saying, but... I want it made out of titanium.

28:32.137 --> 28:33.577
[SPEAKER_15]: Subtitles by the Amara.org community

28:56.270 --> 28:57.711
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the color of bondage.

28:59.192 --> 29:01.354
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a chick magnet is what it is.

29:02.515 --> 29:04.116
[SPEAKER_15]: Because you know women love married men.

29:05.738 --> 29:10.942
[SPEAKER_16]: You know how when you take magnets and you put the negative against the negative and they won't stick together for any reason?

29:11.142 --> 29:13.444
[SPEAKER_16]: In fact, they push each other away with great force.

29:14.044 --> 29:16.486
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what the wedding ring does in the chick magnet sense.

29:19.449 --> 29:21.910
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I think you've been misinformed.

29:22.011 --> 29:22.351
[SPEAKER_15]: But anyways...

29:22.931 --> 29:25.212
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, sorry, I don't understand your hetero culture.

29:26.853 --> 29:30.394
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I don't understand women either, so, you know, we're pretty even.

29:30.494 --> 29:33.135
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what, I don't understand other women myself.

29:33.855 --> 29:36.496
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I think that this whole, I think the whole wedding business is retarded.

29:37.316 --> 29:40.237
[SPEAKER_15]: Damn straight, why the hell do we have to spend so much money on one fucking day?

29:40.257 --> 29:41.438
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm getting married in the backyard!

29:41.858 --> 29:47.000
[SPEAKER_19]: And the ceremony isn't going to be longer than five minutes, and then I'm going to have a party and get fucking drunk!

29:49.960 --> 29:57.263
[SPEAKER_16]: Orange Lounge Radio is here bridging the gap between straight men and gay men because we can at least agree on one thing.

29:57.764 --> 29:58.904
[SPEAKER_16]: Women are crazy.

30:00.105 --> 30:03.267
[SPEAKER_19]: Damn straight, and I can say this because I'm certifiably nuts.

30:04.187 --> 30:06.949
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyways, so yeah, we've already set a date.

30:07.009 --> 30:09.270
[SPEAKER_15]: It is on a Sunday, but it is next year.

30:09.950 --> 30:16.774
[SPEAKER_15]: And I won't be going to E3 next year, unfortunately, because that falls the week after the wedding.

30:17.813 --> 30:19.634
[SPEAKER_15]: which that won't be good.

30:20.575 --> 30:22.656
[SPEAKER_19]: Why do you think I rescheduled mine away from April?

30:22.676 --> 30:23.917
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm doing mine in three months.

30:24.037 --> 30:24.457
[SPEAKER_19]: FIRED!

30:26.298 --> 30:27.139
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't care.

30:27.219 --> 30:30.321
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, ironically enough, they'd probably be paying my way.

30:30.341 --> 30:30.981
[SPEAKER_15]: Make her come with.

30:31.001 --> 30:31.501
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

30:31.521 --> 30:32.522
[SPEAKER_15]: Introduce her to celebrities.

30:32.542 --> 30:38.786
[SPEAKER_19]: In a relationship, there must always be compromise, not, you know, okay, whatever you say.

30:39.026 --> 30:44.829
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, but I don't think honeymoon, you know, over, uh, I don't think I'm gonna win that, you know.

30:44.849 --> 30:45.510
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

30:45.790 --> 30:47.511
[SPEAKER_15]: But anyways, anyways, so yeah, yeah.

30:49.679 --> 30:53.462
[SPEAKER_16]: This will be the night she's listening and your ass is dead when you get home.

30:53.482 --> 30:54.423
[SPEAKER_15]: She's not listening.

30:54.443 --> 30:56.704
[SPEAKER_15]: She doesn't even know how to listen to this show.

31:00.928 --> 31:02.289
[SPEAKER_19]: I started planning a wedding.

31:02.789 --> 31:03.570
[SPEAKER_19]: An actual wedding.

31:04.662 --> 31:13.991
[SPEAKER_19]: I went on one of those retarded websites that gives you a budget, and I saw all this paying for this crap and this crap and... A nude mariachi band?

31:14.631 --> 31:14.771
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

31:15.232 --> 31:24.560
[SPEAKER_19]: And this, and I was like, they started off the budget at like $7,000, and I'm like, fuck a bunch of that, that's, you know, like all my savings right now.

31:25.021 --> 31:26.102
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd be lucky if ours was $7,000.

31:27.654 --> 31:32.075
[SPEAKER_19]: So basically, we're probably going to get out of my wedding for under $1,000.

31:33.356 --> 31:33.576
[SPEAKER_19]: Under $1,000.

31:33.936 --> 31:39.938
[SPEAKER_19]: And then probably go spend another $1,000 when we have our two days at Disneyland honeymoon.

31:41.458 --> 31:42.599
[SPEAKER_19]: And then come back home and go to work.

31:43.699 --> 31:45.379
[SPEAKER_19]: We've been together for seven years already.

31:45.540 --> 31:47.120
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't need all this bullshit.

31:47.360 --> 31:50.981
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I'm wondering, since gays can't technically get married, can we get some kind of discount?

31:51.401 --> 31:52.082
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what I'm wondering.

31:52.262 --> 31:56.603
[SPEAKER_16]: Since we get discount weddings, do we get discounts on the costs?

31:58.407 --> 31:58.947
[SPEAKER_16]: Just curious.

31:59.407 --> 32:00.808
[SPEAKER_15]: No, that's all for a gay wedding.

32:00.888 --> 32:04.949
[SPEAKER_15]: They had this on, oh God, I don't even remember which show it was.

32:05.189 --> 32:07.249
[SPEAKER_16]: Probably something on Bravo, probably.

32:08.049 --> 32:09.650
[SPEAKER_15]: It might have been Lysol.

32:10.450 --> 32:24.753
[SPEAKER_15]: Basically, their wedding ceremony was a fashion show, and what they did was they actually went and got their names legally changed so that it was both last names hyphened.

32:25.794 --> 32:26.274
[SPEAKER_15]: I've heard of that.

32:26.354 --> 32:26.774
[SPEAKER_15]: I've heard of that.

32:27.324 --> 32:38.870
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, one of my friends was telling me about some other friends of hers who actually had their last names combined into one new last name effective when they were married.

32:38.930 --> 32:39.830
[SPEAKER_16]: I've heard of that kind of stuff.

32:40.651 --> 32:42.532
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to have a fucked up last name.

32:42.632 --> 32:43.832
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want the tax breaks.

32:43.912 --> 32:46.213
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to have a fucked up Dutch last name.

32:46.714 --> 32:48.875
[SPEAKER_19]: I have no Dutch blood in me.

32:49.804 --> 32:58.909
[SPEAKER_16]: Wait a minute, without giving away the soon-to-be-mister's last name, does it start with the same three letters that my last name does?

32:59.429 --> 32:59.609
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

32:59.849 --> 33:00.310
[SPEAKER_16]: My real one?

33:01.090 --> 33:01.250
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

33:01.270 --> 33:01.870
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I thought it did.

33:02.451 --> 33:12.656
[SPEAKER_15]: Because that would have been funny if we were both... If you want some Dutch blood in your system, we can go find a Dutch virgin that you can convert over to a man.

33:13.597 --> 33:15.818
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyways, I'm half Dutch, don't do that.

33:17.703 --> 33:21.927
[SPEAKER_19]: I am nothing against anyone Dutch, mind you, because there's you and there's Dan.

33:21.947 --> 33:23.929
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, yeah, I'm sitting right here, so say it.

33:24.369 --> 33:31.816
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got the tons of Celtic and then, you know, Slavic mix, which means I can out-drink anybody.

33:32.036 --> 33:34.098
[SPEAKER_16]: And it also means you're very Enya-esque.

33:34.118 --> 33:42.826
[SPEAKER_15]: So anyways, yeah, we looked at the wedding location crap, and...

33:43.681 --> 33:44.282
[SPEAKER_15]: That's about it.

33:44.322 --> 33:49.107
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought about playing Final Fantasy, but I had other things I was working on, so I couldn't do that.

33:50.368 --> 33:51.869
[SPEAKER_15]: I've started yet another project.

33:51.889 --> 33:54.192
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you going to finish this one?

33:54.232 --> 33:54.572
[SPEAKER_00]: This one?

33:54.752 --> 33:55.153
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, maybe.

33:55.493 --> 34:03.941
[SPEAKER_15]: This one does not involve any actual purchasing of anything or any sort of actual monetary dedication.

34:05.353 --> 34:07.533
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's going to take a very, very, very, very long time to finish.

34:08.414 --> 34:08.794
[SPEAKER_12]: Sounds good.

34:11.254 --> 34:13.355
[SPEAKER_16]: Real quotes from the chat room.

34:13.615 --> 34:16.776
[SPEAKER_16]: www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on chat.

34:17.456 --> 34:22.917
[SPEAKER_16]: SSJ100Matt says, They say 65-75% of men masturbate on their honeymoon.

34:27.578 --> 34:28.198
[SPEAKER_18]: Dot, dot, dot.

34:29.058 --> 34:32.019
[SPEAKER_16]: Also 53% of statistics are made up on the spot, I guess.

34:32.099 --> 34:32.439
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

34:33.857 --> 34:34.117
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

34:35.058 --> 34:37.219
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, let's move on.

34:38.239 --> 34:39.399
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, did you have any other thoughts?

34:40.720 --> 34:41.741
[SPEAKER_16]: God damn.

34:42.741 --> 34:43.641
[SPEAKER_16]: Ow, my foot.

34:44.142 --> 34:46.343
[SPEAKER_08]: Why did I shoot myself in my foot?

34:46.603 --> 34:48.283
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing to do with the conversation.

34:51.645 --> 34:52.685
[SPEAKER_00]: No, my foot.

34:52.745 --> 34:53.886
[SPEAKER_00]: I need that for walking.

34:55.300 --> 34:55.460
[SPEAKER_16]: Seagird

35:24.048 --> 35:25.208
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, how was your week, how was your day?

35:26.049 --> 35:28.129
[SPEAKER_14]: Why did we switch back to my old name from last year?

35:28.149 --> 35:30.450
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know, I felt, I just, you have many names.

35:30.470 --> 35:30.910
[SPEAKER_14]: It's confusing to me.

35:30.930 --> 35:33.211
[SPEAKER_16]: And the next week, if you're here, oh no, we're not having a show next week.

35:34.031 --> 35:36.572
[SPEAKER_16]: If you're next, yeah, we'll just call you Siglatov, I like that.

35:37.652 --> 35:38.032
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't.

35:38.872 --> 35:41.453
[SPEAKER_16]: We can call you Mickey Gerd.

35:42.774 --> 35:43.554
[SPEAKER_16]: That's kind of funny.

35:44.174 --> 35:48.535
[SPEAKER_16]: I called you Miklatov last week, but I think more people know you as Sigurd.

35:48.755 --> 35:50.256
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I should have called you Sigurd last week.

35:50.956 --> 35:52.137
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, it doesn't matter to me.

35:52.457 --> 35:53.558
[SPEAKER_14]: Nobody cares anymore, anyway.

35:54.399 --> 35:56.680
[SPEAKER_16]: You're too busy writing in pencil, too.

35:56.941 --> 35:58.902
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, I'm playing minigames.

35:59.603 --> 36:00.643
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, wait, we're talking about work.

36:00.683 --> 36:01.684
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought we were talking about now.

36:02.365 --> 36:03.405
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I got my hair cut.

36:03.966 --> 36:04.586
[SPEAKER_14]: That's about it.

36:04.806 --> 36:05.647
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's cute.

36:05.867 --> 36:07.588
[SPEAKER_14]: I like your new haircut quite a bit.

36:07.649 --> 36:10.110
[SPEAKER_14]: It's too bad the webcam sucks and we can't use it right now.

36:10.170 --> 36:12.572
[SPEAKER_14]: I can hold the microphone up to my hair and see if that helps.

36:12.632 --> 36:13.293
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, let's see.

36:16.635 --> 36:17.296
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you hear that, y'all?

36:17.316 --> 36:18.557
[SPEAKER_18]: That sounds like hair.

36:18.577 --> 36:19.657
[SPEAKER_14]: That sounds like sexy hair.

36:22.505 --> 36:23.525
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't do much else.

36:23.585 --> 36:23.985
[SPEAKER_14]: I worked.

36:24.506 --> 36:30.887
[SPEAKER_14]: And I came here and... Any songs getting you stuck in your head at work lately?

36:32.067 --> 36:40.249
[SPEAKER_14]: Only the ones I keep on my PSP from Echo Image that has nothing to do with DDR or my British band Manson I like.

36:42.550 --> 36:42.850
[SPEAKER_14]: I see.

36:43.350 --> 36:44.250
[SPEAKER_14]: Just prying.

36:47.291 --> 36:48.011
[SPEAKER_19]: You want anything to drink?

36:50.131 --> 36:50.712
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

36:50.732 --> 36:52.034
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't understand.

36:52.054 --> 36:55.058
[SPEAKER_19]: You have no idea how much Radiohead I've been listening to the last week.

36:55.578 --> 36:55.859
[SPEAKER_19]: Why?

36:55.939 --> 36:56.900
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that your angry band?

36:56.920 --> 36:58.923
[SPEAKER_19]: Radiohead is not an angry band.

36:58.943 --> 37:00.185
[SPEAKER_19]: They're my depressed band.

37:00.665 --> 37:01.306
[SPEAKER_14]: That makes sense.

37:01.506 --> 37:07.795
[SPEAKER_19]: Every other song that popped up on my iPod has been Radiohead or Super Furry Animals.

37:09.048 --> 37:15.251
[SPEAKER_16]: My depressed music, and I hate to admit this because it's going to make me sound so gay, but my depression music is Tori Amos.

37:15.411 --> 37:17.792
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, if I break it out to Tori, just get away.

37:18.272 --> 37:26.116
[SPEAKER_19]: I wanted to slit my wrist after listening to a combo of Radiohead, Bjork, Gloomy Sunday, and Tori Amos.

37:26.516 --> 37:30.638
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I wanted to slit my wrist after hearing Bjork's latest album as well, but that's just because it fucking sucked.

37:30.718 --> 37:31.378
[SPEAKER_19]: I liked it.

37:32.038 --> 37:33.639
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought it was very stylish.

37:34.199 --> 37:34.700
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't like it.

37:35.180 --> 37:35.600
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all right.

37:36.129 --> 37:39.151
[SPEAKER_19]: That's because you need to expand your horizons.

37:39.451 --> 37:39.971
[SPEAKER_16]: Broaden them.

37:40.111 --> 37:44.393
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, my musical horizons are very broad.

37:44.553 --> 37:48.215
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, look at my... Trans-ambient house.

37:48.475 --> 37:53.058
[SPEAKER_16]: Britney, Christina, Hilary Duff, Backstreet Boys.

37:53.278 --> 37:53.758
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I'm kidding.

37:54.198 --> 37:56.939
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't listen to that crap.

37:56.959 --> 37:58.260
[SPEAKER_15]: You have one Britney Spears song.

37:58.280 --> 38:02.082
[SPEAKER_15]: You have the expansive music taste of a teenage girl.

38:02.662 --> 38:05.104
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, that's a very good description.

38:05.504 --> 38:05.864
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

38:07.120 --> 38:08.621
[SPEAKER_15]: Speaking of music, it's quite funny.

38:08.641 --> 38:12.184
[SPEAKER_15]: You know that one song by Gwen Stefani, Holla Batgirl?

38:12.204 --> 38:13.865
[SPEAKER_19]: Never heard it, thank God.

38:14.365 --> 38:16.887
[SPEAKER_15]: This shit is bananas, B-A-N-A.

38:16.927 --> 38:17.528
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, okay.

38:17.768 --> 38:32.438
[SPEAKER_15]: So Nelly was singing the song, like, all week, but with the wrong lyrics, because she didn't know what the lyrics were, and I'm trying to remember what they were, but it's something about Kenny Rogers ate my cat, I ain't no Harlem Batgirl or something like that.

38:33.239 --> 38:35.541
[SPEAKER_15]: It was really weird, and she kept singing...

38:37.657 --> 38:55.731
[SPEAKER_19]: I... Plugging my ears, la la la la la la la I don't even know where she... Her lyrics are actually better than the song, so... I will never, ever, ever support anything Gwen Stefani does ever again.

38:56.812 --> 39:01.716
[SPEAKER_16]: Does this have to do with the fact that every photo she's in now she's with these, like, totally fake Japanese girls?

39:01.736 --> 39:03.958
[SPEAKER_19]: It has everything to do with that.

39:04.559 --> 39:05.159
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just curious.

39:06.613 --> 39:09.414
[SPEAKER_15]: I do not... She thinks she's a Japanese girl, because she's not.

39:10.154 --> 39:15.456
[SPEAKER_19]: What she is doing is actually very damaging to women in general.

39:16.116 --> 39:17.697
[SPEAKER_15]: That's like saying Shane's black.

39:21.518 --> 39:26.660
[SPEAKER_19]: Gwen Stefani no longer receives any bit of support from me that I might ever have.

39:28.421 --> 39:29.121
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what's weird?

39:29.421 --> 39:30.882
[SPEAKER_19]: She is a waste of human flesh.

39:31.402 --> 39:33.342
[SPEAKER_16]: I was... And she can't sing for shit.

39:33.402 --> 39:34.383
[SPEAKER_16]: We were listening to the...

39:35.740 --> 39:36.221
[SPEAKER_16]: I have it!

39:50.757 --> 39:54.138
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I thought that the first one, yeah.

39:54.518 --> 39:56.159
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought, back then, I thought it was fine.

39:56.179 --> 39:56.519
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, no, no.

39:56.779 --> 39:57.659
[SPEAKER_19]: Now I can't squirter.

39:57.679 --> 39:58.079
[SPEAKER_19]: No, no, no.

39:58.159 --> 39:58.819
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no.

39:58.979 --> 39:59.780
[SPEAKER_16]: I haven't gotten to my point yet.

40:01.080 --> 40:02.120
[SPEAKER_16]: But I was looking at the linear notes.

40:02.140 --> 40:05.901
[SPEAKER_16]: I was looking at the pictures and I was like, oh my god, they're so young in these pictures.

40:06.481 --> 40:08.962
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, they're like five years younger than I am now.

40:10.102 --> 40:11.563
[SPEAKER_16]: And that just made me feel old.

40:12.303 --> 40:17.744
[SPEAKER_16]: When Gwen Stefani looks like five years younger than me, that makes me feel really old.

40:18.845 --> 40:19.465
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to share that.

40:21.133 --> 40:31.176
[SPEAKER_14]: I got a new high score right now on my Mario game.

40:31.856 --> 40:32.336
[SPEAKER_14]: Very nice.

40:32.696 --> 40:33.417
[SPEAKER_14]: What Mario game?

40:34.177 --> 40:36.558
[SPEAKER_14]: The one where you hit the shells with the paddle.

40:36.578 --> 40:37.078
[SPEAKER_12]: Good job.

40:37.458 --> 40:37.838
[SPEAKER_12]: Good job.

40:41.319 --> 40:41.599
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

40:42.679 --> 40:45.061
[SPEAKER_16]: My week and my day was okay, I guess.

40:45.241 --> 40:46.722
[SPEAKER_16]: I just, you know, did the work thing.

40:47.263 --> 40:53.607
[SPEAKER_16]: And yesterday I went to Ikea with some friends, including Sigurd, because we picked him up at the Bart and then went over to Ikea.

40:54.468 --> 40:59.892
[SPEAKER_16]: And if they don't have Ikea in your neighborhood, then too bad for you, because Ikea is very cool, and they sell, like...

41:00.692 --> 41:03.853
[SPEAKER_16]: It's totally like my first apartment, the store.

41:05.814 --> 41:10.996
[SPEAKER_16]: It's great and they have, you know, stuff that you, it's Lego furniture because you take it home and build it yourself.

41:11.597 --> 41:17.959
[SPEAKER_16]: And I was being a real nasty bitch though because I hadn't eaten in like 12 hours and I was getting a massive headache.

41:18.019 --> 41:19.200
[SPEAKER_16]: It was really, really bad.

41:19.240 --> 41:19.960
[SPEAKER_16]: Like I don't know what it was.

41:20.552 --> 41:36.575
[SPEAKER_16]: and so the only cure was Swedish meatballs from Ikea so I had to wait in line for like 30 minutes to get Swedish meatballs and that was cool because Swedish meatballs rock and then my buddy John bought like a new bookshelf and it was so big that it wouldn't fit in the trunk of his car

41:37.028 --> 41:41.371
[SPEAKER_16]: So we had to lay it out in the backseat, except the only problem was that he was taking five people in his car.

41:42.051 --> 41:47.315
[SPEAKER_16]: So there were three of us in the backseat with a new bookshelf, and I think my feet are still in a little bit of pain.

41:47.335 --> 41:50.436
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know about you, Sigurd, but my feet are in pain.

41:52.398 --> 41:58.261
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't know pain until you ride in the back of a VW Bug crammed with four people in the backseat.

42:00.803 --> 42:03.625
[SPEAKER_19]: You don't know pain until you're forced to sit through a Britney Spears marathon.

42:05.396 --> 42:07.117
[SPEAKER_16]: Which we might do tonight if we run out of show.

42:07.137 --> 42:12.119
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, I do know that kind of pain because I sat through a marathon of, what was it?

42:12.819 --> 42:13.159
[SPEAKER_15]: Chaotic.

42:13.179 --> 42:13.560
[SPEAKER_15]: Chaotic.

42:14.560 --> 42:17.121
[SPEAKER_19]: I just found out that I'm going to go see George Carlin on the 9th.

42:17.782 --> 42:18.702
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, that's kind of cool.

42:18.922 --> 42:19.362
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

42:20.163 --> 42:23.024
[SPEAKER_19]: And then go see the guy who does the Here's Your Sign.

42:23.663 --> 42:24.024
[SPEAKER_16]: George Carlin

42:37.765 --> 42:38.726
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm like, wait a minute, no, no, no.

42:38.766 --> 42:41.249
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, I'd go see Parliament too if I could.

42:41.469 --> 42:48.417
[SPEAKER_16]: I know, but I could totally see you at a G, Parliament funk concert.

42:48.437 --> 42:49.018
[SPEAKER_16]: It would be hilarious.

42:49.038 --> 42:50.780
[SPEAKER_19]: George Carlin is freaking awesome.

42:50.800 --> 42:54.744
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, but then George Carlin is the seven words you can't say guy.

42:55.925 --> 42:58.408
[SPEAKER_19]: And then what's his name, Bill Engvall?

42:58.488 --> 42:58.769
[SPEAKER_16]: Engvall.

42:59.269 --> 43:01.331
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to go see him in November.

43:01.431 --> 43:04.674
[SPEAKER_16]: Bill Ingvall is with Blue Collar TV, and I don't like that show.

43:04.694 --> 43:14.942
[SPEAKER_15]: There's one, no, actually, one of the guys that's on the Blue Collar comedy tour, the, like, really angry one, he's actually pretty good, because his comedy isn't all redneck comedy, it's just pretty, it's just normal comedy.

43:15.503 --> 43:21.888
[SPEAKER_15]: Whereas, like, you know, Jeff Foxworthy couldn't do normal stand-up comedy, you know, his life depended on.

43:22.188 --> 43:24.590
[SPEAKER_15]: But I can't remember if Bill Ingvall is a good one or not.

43:24.670 --> 43:26.572
[SPEAKER_15]: It's, um, the guy that's in the black, like,

43:27.352 --> 43:27.812
[SPEAKER_15]: TOUCH OF SATAN

43:53.306 --> 43:53.726
[SPEAKER_16]: I did.

43:53.846 --> 43:58.269
[SPEAKER_16]: I watched Touch of Satan at the Mystery Science Theater thing, and that was the Touch of Satan one.

43:58.549 --> 43:58.929
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

43:59.069 --> 44:05.552
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't find Mystery Science Theater 3000 hilarious like a lot of my friends do, but I appreciate it.

44:05.652 --> 44:06.553
[SPEAKER_16]: I respect it.

44:06.953 --> 44:09.554
[SPEAKER_16]: I just don't laugh out loud a lot, but that Touch of Satan.

44:10.275 --> 44:17.979
[SPEAKER_16]: The bad thing is I was actually sitting there watching the Mystery Science Theater thing, and I'm kind of going, you know, I'm kind of curious what this movie is like without all the talking.

44:22.065 --> 44:22.625
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know why.

44:22.746 --> 44:24.087
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I just like bad movies.

44:24.187 --> 44:24.827
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know why.

44:24.907 --> 44:27.369
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of the Mystery Sanctuary 3000 movies are really funny.

44:27.769 --> 44:28.350
[SPEAKER_15]: Some are not.

44:28.730 --> 44:31.152
[SPEAKER_19]: This Island Earth can be yours if the price is right.

44:32.313 --> 44:33.573
[SPEAKER_19]: And my other favorite line in that one.

44:34.314 --> 44:35.555
[SPEAKER_19]: My own private airfield.

44:37.156 --> 44:38.817
[SPEAKER_19]: Which one is that from?

44:38.957 --> 44:39.258
[SPEAKER_16]: The movie.

44:39.318 --> 44:42.320
[SPEAKER_19]: And then there's the one with the gunslinger, which is one of my favorites.

44:43.040 --> 44:45.042
[SPEAKER_19]: With the female sheriff.

44:46.893 --> 44:48.894
[SPEAKER_19]: That one's really wrong.

44:48.914 --> 44:50.154
[SPEAKER_15]: What was it, The Touch of Satan?

44:50.174 --> 44:55.156
[SPEAKER_15]: It had some wonderful lines about, like, they kept making references to walnut farming or something like that.

44:56.057 --> 45:00.158
[SPEAKER_15]: And, like, he's all, oh no, my prized walnut died or something like that.

45:00.558 --> 45:10.462
[SPEAKER_19]: Manos, The Hands of Fate, where they showed the movie so awful that the doctor and the assistant both apologized for making them watch it.

45:11.866 --> 45:13.067
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

45:36.685 --> 45:39.768
[SPEAKER_19]: Bought waffles and came back and ate a whole box of waffles

46:01.887 --> 46:04.008
[SPEAKER_16]: I forgot to call my daddy, but my daddy lives in a trailer by Lake Eufaula now.

46:22.458 --> 46:24.201
[SPEAKER_15]: No, seriously, best Batman movie ever.

46:24.421 --> 46:24.822
[SPEAKER_15]: Go see it.

46:25.022 --> 46:25.944
[SPEAKER_15]: I highly recommend it.

46:25.984 --> 46:26.985
[SPEAKER_15]: You will not be disappointed.

46:27.125 --> 46:27.326
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

46:27.606 --> 46:31.953
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to do this real quick because the chat room suggested we dedicate this to the daddies of the world right now.

46:32.273 --> 46:35.559
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're going to play a song from DDR Solo, and it's called My Baby Mama.

46:35.759 --> 46:37.642
[SPEAKER_16]: And we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge.

46:57.574 --> 46:58.274
[SPEAKER_06]: Outro Music

48:06.423 --> 48:06.743
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

48:07.183 --> 48:08.804
[SPEAKER_16]: Dedicated to the dads of the world there.

48:09.445 --> 48:11.646
[SPEAKER_16]: One dad having to defend himself there in that song, actually.

48:12.286 --> 48:15.248
[SPEAKER_16]: Hopefully, just remember, your dad could be like that.

48:15.608 --> 48:19.210
[SPEAKER_19]: That song's about a guy cheating on his woman, saying he's off with his baby mama.

48:19.550 --> 48:20.371
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't want no scrub.

48:20.711 --> 48:20.991
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

48:22.211 --> 48:26.914
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, we have somebody who hasn't been on the show a whole lot, but we have my roommate here.

48:27.054 --> 48:27.314
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi.

48:27.434 --> 48:27.754
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello.

48:27.955 --> 48:28.375
[SPEAKER_16]: How are you?

48:28.775 --> 48:29.355
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm doing well.

48:29.395 --> 48:29.716
[SPEAKER_16]: How are you?

48:29.736 --> 48:31.336
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you have a stage name you want to use?

48:32.137 --> 48:32.217
[SPEAKER_13]: Um...

48:33.701 --> 48:40.426
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to be one of those middle-aged 300-pound women in a muumuu with five shillings.

48:56.914 --> 48:59.738
[SPEAKER_19]: Mama, I want me a new Barbie.

49:00.499 --> 49:02.602
[SPEAKER_19]: Mama, get me some chicken.

49:04.184 --> 49:09.291
[SPEAKER_16]: And so it had me thinking, well, we should be asking Extifer about the funny people that show up at Walmart.

49:09.311 --> 49:14.118
[SPEAKER_16]: So do you have any interesting, like, 400-pound women that buy, like, thong panty stories or anything?

49:15.600 --> 49:24.335
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have any 400-pound women buying thong stories, but I had a bunch of guys buy them.

49:24.375 --> 49:27.781
[SPEAKER_13]: Walmart used to have this promotion or something like that.

49:28.443 --> 49:30.004
[SPEAKER_13]: Thong Underwear Guy Thong Underwear

49:47.174 --> 49:50.097
[SPEAKER_13]: and bought a bunch of them, and I just thought it was kind of weird.

49:50.377 --> 49:51.378
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that all they bought?

49:51.759 --> 49:53.600
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it was, actually.

49:53.640 --> 49:54.841
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what else would have been funny?

49:54.881 --> 49:59.686
[SPEAKER_13]: If they'd bought all those thongs and a jar of mayonnaise or something, just to kind of throw you.

49:59.866 --> 50:03.530
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't remember any mayonnaise, but the thongs were still funny.

50:04.511 --> 50:07.854
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait, so they were buying, like, there were how many of them?

50:09.755 --> 50:13.118
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't remember off the top of my head, but maybe like three or four.

50:13.138 --> 50:13.798
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

50:14.479 --> 50:15.320
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they were buying like ten?

50:15.340 --> 50:16.300
[SPEAKER_13]: They bought them together.

50:16.380 --> 50:25.047
[SPEAKER_13]: That's like the funny thing about it is, I mean, I don't know, like if you're going to buy some thong underwear, I guess invite your friends.

50:27.355 --> 50:30.616
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe it was less embarrassing to buy together, I don't know.

50:30.996 --> 50:32.896
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, what is the policy on that?

50:32.936 --> 50:36.077
[SPEAKER_16]: See, obviously you can't point and laugh at them and go, ha ha, you're buying underwear.

50:36.577 --> 50:45.479
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I have a good poker face, so I'm just like, you know, I just run them through and then have my laughs afterwards in the break room.

50:45.539 --> 50:51.740
[SPEAKER_16]: No, like as you're grabbing the underwear and putting it on the scanner, are you thinking, this is going to be touching some fat guy's balls pretty soon?

50:51.940 --> 50:53.221
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, I do think that...

50:54.963 --> 50:56.885
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm just glad that it hasn't yet.

51:01.388 --> 51:04.751
[SPEAKER_16]: Any other wonderful, glorious Walmart stories you want to share?

51:04.951 --> 51:07.393
[SPEAKER_13]: If I do come up with any, I'll let you know.

51:07.553 --> 51:08.314
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, sounds good.

51:08.734 --> 51:09.135
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

51:09.215 --> 51:12.137
[SPEAKER_16]: We should make this a regular segment where you come tell us a funny Walmart story.

51:12.478 --> 51:14.499
[SPEAKER_16]: So you get to work on next week's edition.

51:14.519 --> 51:15.260
[SPEAKER_16]: Or we're not here next week.

51:15.580 --> 51:16.921
[SPEAKER_16]: You have two weeks to come up with another one.

51:16.961 --> 51:17.542
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a lot of time.

51:17.662 --> 51:18.583
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, you do that.

51:18.783 --> 51:19.263
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

51:23.686 --> 51:26.087
[SPEAKER_16]: Poor bastard has his house taken over every Sunday by us.

51:28.249 --> 51:29.169
[SPEAKER_16]: How would you like that?

51:30.430 --> 51:33.012
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I have an offer open.

51:34.652 --> 51:35.593
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, that's true, huh?

51:35.653 --> 51:36.033
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

51:36.293 --> 51:38.695
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, if you don't mind going out to the boonies of Citrus Heights.

51:39.035 --> 51:40.716
[SPEAKER_16]: I used to live in the boonies of Citrus Heights.

51:40.776 --> 51:44.718
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, not really the boonies, but... Not really the boonies, but it's a nice neighborhood.

51:45.119 --> 51:45.419
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

51:45.639 --> 51:46.840
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it's a nice neighborhood.

51:46.860 --> 51:48.361
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I know which area you're... I'm gonna have a yard!

51:48.381 --> 51:50.862
[SPEAKER_16]: Dude, you're gonna have to water a yard?

51:50.962 --> 51:52.343
[SPEAKER_16]: Or, Dudette, you're gonna have to water a yard?

51:52.363 --> 51:52.423
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm...

51:53.134 --> 51:54.595
[SPEAKER_16]: Shit, no, Dan's job.

51:56.435 --> 51:57.796
[SPEAKER_16]: My parents are going on vacation.

51:57.836 --> 51:59.097
[SPEAKER_16]: They want me to come over and water.

52:00.537 --> 52:01.638
[SPEAKER_16]: What's this manual labor stuff?

52:03.538 --> 52:03.899
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

52:05.679 --> 52:09.961
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's talk about some actual DDR, Bomani-ish news, things going on.

52:10.061 --> 52:21.766
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, this is interesting because no other website is running this story except for us, so I'm assuming this is something you actually found out through your own means, but you're talking about release dates, right?

52:21.914 --> 52:22.154
[SPEAKER_16]: and so on.

52:37.882 --> 52:40.344
[SPEAKER_15]: September 28th, I want to say, for DDR Extreme?

52:40.384 --> 52:52.235
[SPEAKER_16]: According to our website, our own website, ornstownstream.com, DDR Extreme 2 is going to be out September 28th, 2005, and DDR Ultramix 3, November 2nd, 2005.

52:52.575 --> 52:54.717
[SPEAKER_16]: That's correct.

52:54.817 --> 52:55.398
[SPEAKER_16]: Election Day.

52:57.119 --> 52:57.339
[SPEAKER_16]: Right?

52:57.680 --> 52:58.260
[SPEAKER_16]: First Tuesday?

52:58.881 --> 52:59.441
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

52:59.601 --> 53:00.742
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't vote.

53:01.123 --> 53:02.204
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for ruining America.

53:04.412 --> 53:07.253
[SPEAKER_16]: So define what initial street date means.

53:07.293 --> 53:09.594
[SPEAKER_16]: Does this mean it's already solid or what?

53:09.614 --> 53:12.756
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me give you an idea of how solid game street dates are.

53:13.316 --> 53:15.357
[SPEAKER_15]: There's this game called Psychonauts.

53:15.417 --> 53:16.517
[SPEAKER_15]: That's right, Psychonauts.

53:16.557 --> 53:19.358
[SPEAKER_15]: Came out on the Xbox not too long ago.

53:19.378 --> 53:20.699
[SPEAKER_15]: It was supposed to be coming out for the PlayStation 2.

53:21.379 --> 53:22.179
[SPEAKER_15]: This was back in May.

53:22.680 --> 53:23.380
[SPEAKER_15]: Got pushed to June.

53:23.740 --> 53:24.761
[SPEAKER_15]: Then got pushed to July.

53:24.861 --> 53:25.801
[SPEAKER_15]: Then went back to June.

53:27.062 --> 53:28.342
[SPEAKER_15]: Back to July, then back to June.

53:28.502 --> 53:30.083
[SPEAKER_15]: And it finally came out in June.

53:30.885 --> 53:33.026
[SPEAKER_15]: But, um, so, it depends.

53:33.126 --> 53:36.368
[SPEAKER_15]: Certain, um, companies, they'll move the dates around a little bit.

53:37.008 --> 53:43.051
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, it being about, you know, a ways away, date-wise, you know, three months away, it's possible it could move.

53:43.571 --> 53:44.212
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think it will.

53:44.532 --> 53:46.453
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, just because Konami's pretty good on their dates.

53:46.873 --> 53:55.838
[SPEAKER_15]: Other companies like EA and, oh, I don't know, um, Rockstar and anybody that's owned by Jack of all games, their dates are all fucked up.

53:56.298 --> 53:56.598
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

53:56.738 --> 53:57.418
[SPEAKER_15]: All over the place.

53:57.919 --> 53:58.299
[SPEAKER_15]: But, um,

53:59.548 --> 54:06.185
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so basically I think that's probably pretty solid, just because the other two games before came out around the same time, so it makes sense, you know.

54:08.430 --> 54:17.354
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll let you know as we're getting closer when they're coming out because I'm the one that actually keeps track of our date changes in our system.

54:17.774 --> 54:18.214
[SPEAKER_16]: That's cool.

54:18.374 --> 54:18.955
[SPEAKER_16]: Good.

54:18.975 --> 54:20.815
[SPEAKER_16]: So you're taking it to OrangeLaundry.com.

54:20.916 --> 54:21.196
[SPEAKER_16]: Love it.

54:21.276 --> 54:21.516
[SPEAKER_16]: Love it.

54:22.176 --> 54:24.237
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, and Carioca Revolution Party Edition.

54:24.257 --> 54:25.258
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that's coming out too.

54:25.598 --> 54:28.379
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, and also the bundle I think is going to be $69, I think.

54:28.439 --> 54:29.239
[SPEAKER_15]: What bundle?

54:30.960 --> 54:35.121
[SPEAKER_15]: For, um, it's Ultramix 3, I think, is their bundle.

54:35.341 --> 54:36.001
[SPEAKER_15]: It's $69.

54:36.461 --> 54:36.882
[SPEAKER_16]: Retail.

54:36.962 --> 54:38.362
[SPEAKER_16]: I hear the Xbox pad's really good.

54:38.402 --> 54:39.842
[SPEAKER_16]: I've never played with one.

54:39.882 --> 54:44.724
[SPEAKER_16]: But I still use my Red Octane Ignition because it hasn't broke yet, so it serves me well.

54:44.744 --> 54:47.164
[SPEAKER_15]: I know Taiko No Tachiton 2's coming out at some point.

54:47.484 --> 54:47.784
[SPEAKER_16]: Really?

54:47.924 --> 54:48.885
[SPEAKER_16]: Or you mean Taiko Drum Master?

54:49.085 --> 54:49.425
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever.

54:49.525 --> 54:49.865
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

54:50.845 --> 54:53.106
[SPEAKER_16]: You gotta post more about the other games too, not just the two.

54:53.146 --> 54:59.049
[SPEAKER_15]: I try, I'm like, trying to keep track of, literally, there's a date change every day of the goddamn week.

54:59.849 --> 55:09.873
[SPEAKER_15]: Seriously, there's all these games that don't exist that our Dallas people are saying that do exist, and I tell them that they're not, and then they're wrong, and yeah.

55:10.673 --> 55:28.317
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, these dates should really come as no surprise, because it's always been kind of assumed that both games are coming out in the fall, and honestly, we kind of have a pattern going here now from the past two years, and we usually get extreme September-ish, and we get...

55:29.478 --> 55:34.921
[SPEAKER_16]: The Ultra Mixed Games November-ish, so this really isn't a surprise at all that these dates are the way they are.

55:35.202 --> 55:37.863
[SPEAKER_16]: Although one is really close to the end of the month and one is really close to the beginning.

55:38.264 --> 55:44.288
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't remember the games coming out so close together because they're only about four weeks apart at this point.

55:44.908 --> 55:47.790
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think previously we've had like seven or eight weeks between the games.

55:48.030 --> 55:52.994
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it's really like, you know, as far as the release schedule or whatever.

55:53.414 --> 55:54.274
[SPEAKER_16]: Sigurd, you're back.

55:54.574 --> 55:56.675
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, I don't know what you can tell me and can't tell me about NDAs.

55:56.695 --> 55:59.896
[SPEAKER_16]: We're talking about the release dates for Extreme 2 and Ultramix 3.

56:01.237 --> 56:02.717
[SPEAKER_16]: Are they close?

56:04.058 --> 56:04.478
[SPEAKER_16]: Or what?

56:04.678 --> 56:05.198
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you know?

56:06.379 --> 56:11.921
[SPEAKER_14]: I honestly know nothing about the release dates, except what online retail sites are saying.

56:12.081 --> 56:18.363
[SPEAKER_14]: And usually, you can trust those if it's not Red Octane putting out the game.

56:20.437 --> 56:22.518
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, but let's face it, you pushed back three times.

56:22.819 --> 56:32.905
[SPEAKER_14]: If it's not in the groove, it usually has a pretty good release date, and if they report on it, they usually get that from the company, but I haven't seen any official things in the office.

56:34.086 --> 56:37.388
[SPEAKER_16]: It's kind of weird that he would find out before you, but I guess that's the way it goes.

56:37.408 --> 56:39.510
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, he doesn't deal with the sales end of it.

56:39.710 --> 56:44.133
[SPEAKER_19]: We've also gotten GameStop has most of them, too.

56:45.814 --> 56:47.275
[SPEAKER_19]: I just asked Dan if everyone knew anything.

56:47.833 --> 56:49.194
[SPEAKER_15]: They're all on the same mailing list.

56:49.214 --> 56:57.822
[SPEAKER_16]: What I want to know is, when are those V-Rares, assuming that both are going to have a V-Rare again, I don't see why they wouldn't, because I think people like those, and Konami likes it when people like things.

56:58.282 --> 57:06.530
[SPEAKER_16]: Assuming we're getting new V-Rares, I'm not going to bother asking Seeger, because he'll just tell me NDA, but assuming we're getting new V-Rares, the question is, when will those come out?

57:06.570 --> 57:09.953
[SPEAKER_16]: Could we get them maybe before, with a pre-order, or are we just going to get them the day of the game?

57:10.033 --> 57:14.677
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you know, maybe we can get some hookups with those people from Konami of Japan checking out our show.

57:16.403 --> 57:26.156
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh yes, we were perusing our website statistic logs for another project and we were looking at some of the domains that have been visiting us and we were kind of happy with some of the ones we saw.

57:26.256 --> 57:29.361
[SPEAKER_16]: So, hi to our friends at Konami of Japan who listen secretly to our show.

57:30.182 --> 57:31.003
[SPEAKER_19]: What time is it there?

57:32.144 --> 57:32.405
[SPEAKER_19]: Like...

57:32.935 --> 57:33.875
[SPEAKER_16]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

58:02.031 --> 58:04.555
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's your release dates for the new games.

58:04.575 --> 58:13.169
[SPEAKER_16]: I think what we'll do, we'll actually go to a longer break right now and when we come back from this break, we got a brand new Ultramix 3 song to play for you guys and we want to talk about this story.

58:13.830 --> 58:16.054
[SPEAKER_16]: Pump it up and in the groove.

58:17.970 --> 58:18.930
[SPEAKER_16]: are joining forces.

58:19.470 --> 58:25.932
[SPEAKER_16]: And yes, we already knew this in some capacity, but I was quite surprised with the news I heard this week.

58:25.952 --> 58:28.272
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm really curious to see what you guys have to say about it.

58:28.312 --> 58:31.273
[SPEAKER_16]: Skypline will be open as well at some point when we come back.

58:32.293 --> 58:35.153
[SPEAKER_16]: So let's go to a break, and we'll come back.

58:35.253 --> 58:39.934
[SPEAKER_16]: So in this break, I think we'll hear some... Since we did in the last break, we did some DDR songs we haven't heard in a while.

58:40.294 --> 58:43.835
[SPEAKER_16]: And this break, we'll do some 2DX songs we haven't heard in a while.

58:44.375 --> 58:49.946
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're going to start it off with, let's see, I don't know, what am I in the mood to hear?

58:50.006 --> 58:52.231
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's hear Sanctus.

58:53.473 --> 58:55.817
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

58:57.230 --> 58:58.330
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

59:31.673 --> 59:32.554
Thanks for watching!

59:59.614 --> 01:00:00.714
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:00:40.258 --> 01:00:40.859
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

01:01:01.673 --> 01:01:02.834
Thank you for watching!

01:01:37.362 --> 01:01:38.143
Come on!

01:01:38.203 --> 01:01:38.803
Come on!

01:02:06.804 --> 01:02:07.385
[SPEAKER_08]: Outro Music

01:02:27.444 --> 01:02:28.166
Thanks for watching!

01:03:20.502 --> 01:03:22.123
Music Music Music Music

01:03:49.222 --> 01:03:49.465
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

01:04:39.415 --> 01:04:40.016
Thanks for watching!

01:05:44.719 --> 01:05:48.063
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everybody, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:05:48.103 --> 01:05:49.544
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you're having a

01:06:00.177 --> 01:06:00.737
[SPEAKER_16]: Nice night.

01:06:01.138 --> 01:06:02.739
[SPEAKER_16]: Very happy, fun, go-lucky night.

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:05.161
[SPEAKER_16]: There's violence in my living room right now.

01:06:05.721 --> 01:06:10.745
[SPEAKER_16]: My roommate's watching Final Destination 2, and I just watched some girl get her head chopped off.

01:06:11.605 --> 01:06:12.406
[SPEAKER_16]: It wasn't very nice.

01:06:13.487 --> 01:06:18.991
[SPEAKER_15]: Might I add that Final Destination 2 is exactly the same movie as Final Destination 1, just gorier.

01:06:19.411 --> 01:06:20.432
[SPEAKER_15]: That is about it.

01:06:21.593 --> 01:06:23.055
[SPEAKER_15]: It is exactly the same.

01:06:23.415 --> 01:06:24.977
[SPEAKER_19]: How did her head get chopped off?

01:06:25.437 --> 01:06:26.759
[SPEAKER_16]: She was stuck in an elevator door.

01:06:28.941 --> 01:06:30.463
[SPEAKER_16]: Her head was stuck in an elevator door.

01:06:30.523 --> 01:06:30.823
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

01:06:32.165 --> 01:06:34.946
[SPEAKER_16]: The Final Destination movies were all these crazy death trap scenarios.

01:06:35.007 --> 01:06:36.287
[SPEAKER_16]: It was like Mousetrap, you know?

01:06:36.587 --> 01:06:40.409
[SPEAKER_16]: First the ball rolls down the stairs, then it rolls down a little tube, and it sets off the guy who jumps in the bin.

01:06:40.749 --> 01:06:41.610
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, all that crap.

01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:42.790
[SPEAKER_16]: I love that game.

01:06:43.691 --> 01:06:45.212
[SPEAKER_16]: That's like the Final Destination movies.

01:06:45.232 --> 01:06:47.593
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like Mousetrap the movie, except people die in hideous ways.

01:06:47.833 --> 01:06:54.937
[SPEAKER_15]: That'd be hilarious if there was a movie where the villain, his calling card was the Mousetrap game, and then the whole thing would set off a bomb at the end.

01:06:55.197 --> 01:06:58.438
[SPEAKER_15]: The only problem with Mousetrap, though, is that sometimes it didn't go off just right.

01:06:58.638 --> 01:07:00.099
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, it gets stuck or something.

01:07:00.639 --> 01:07:01.660
[SPEAKER_15]: So I guess that wouldn't work.

01:07:03.922 --> 01:07:04.842
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, anyway, I don't know.

01:07:04.862 --> 01:07:09.204
[SPEAKER_16]: This guy with the hook got the chick's hair and then she ended up getting stuck in the door because of it.

01:07:09.284 --> 01:07:09.645
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

01:07:10.885 --> 01:07:11.826
[SPEAKER_16]: And then it was like, ew, blood.

01:07:11.866 --> 01:07:15.847
[SPEAKER_16]: And then Extraper said something about all the... I haven't seen Found Destination 2.

01:07:16.068 --> 01:07:17.008
[SPEAKER_16]: I've only seen the first one.

01:07:17.548 --> 01:07:19.469
[SPEAKER_16]: But he said something about Kool-Aid.

01:07:19.689 --> 01:07:20.810
[SPEAKER_16]: All the blood looks like Kool-Aid.

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:25.052
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, there's a lot of CG blood in this one.

01:07:25.292 --> 01:07:31.575
[SPEAKER_15]: One person gets killed by a giant window falling on them and flattens them.

01:07:32.375 --> 01:07:32.916
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:07:51.249 --> 01:07:56.133
[SPEAKER_16]: My best friend at the time and I were laughing and laughing and laughing.

01:07:56.533 --> 01:08:00.876
[SPEAKER_16]: And people were turning around in the theater looking at us going, you insensitive bastards.

01:08:00.896 --> 01:08:02.817
[SPEAKER_16]: That girl just got splattered all over the street.

01:08:02.857 --> 01:08:04.138
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're laughing and laughing.

01:08:04.338 --> 01:08:05.459
[SPEAKER_16]: Because it's the way that it happens.

01:08:05.479 --> 01:08:05.939
[SPEAKER_16]: She's all screwed.

01:08:05.959 --> 01:08:08.061
[SPEAKER_16]: She's like, I just wish you guys would drop dead.

01:08:08.121 --> 01:08:11.003
[SPEAKER_16]: And then here comes the bus.

01:08:13.525 --> 01:08:16.067
[SPEAKER_19]: Jurassic Park 3 when they were pulling the people out of the field.

01:08:17.182 --> 01:08:18.184
[SPEAKER_19]: Buffet, buffet.

01:08:19.107 --> 01:08:25.542
[SPEAKER_16]: I haven't seen Jurassic Park 3 because it just, you know, it was Jurassic Park 3 and I figured 1 and 2 was... It was with the raptors.

01:08:27.577 --> 01:08:28.877
[SPEAKER_16]: Really?

01:08:29.738 --> 01:08:34.398
[SPEAKER_19]: These people were crossing the fields and the velociraptors were running through this tall field.

01:08:34.818 --> 01:08:36.699
[SPEAKER_19]: And you'd see little people disappear.

01:08:36.919 --> 01:08:40.920
[SPEAKER_19]: And we were like, it's a buffet for the raptors.

01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:49.441
[SPEAKER_15]: For a second there, before she mentioned raptors, I thought it might have been like, you know, maybe Rosie O'Donnell or something in the field.

01:08:49.461 --> 01:08:54.482
[SPEAKER_15]: She might have been like, you know, snatching people because you never know.

01:08:55.834 --> 01:08:56.074
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks.

01:08:56.594 --> 01:08:56.894
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

01:08:57.835 --> 01:09:01.416
[SPEAKER_16]: Back to the gaming realm, which we talk about here on this show.

01:09:02.457 --> 01:09:04.437
[SPEAKER_16]: Brand new Ultramix 3 news this week.

01:09:04.537 --> 01:09:08.139
[SPEAKER_16]: Last week, we got to unveil this, because nobody else found this.

01:09:08.159 --> 01:09:15.442
[SPEAKER_16]: We were the first to find this, that Spray had actually announced on their website that they were going to have a new song in Ultramix 3 called I Am Gothic.

01:09:15.482 --> 01:09:18.703
[SPEAKER_16]: And we played this song for you guys last night, which it sounds like... Last week.

01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:20.341
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry, last week.

01:09:20.661 --> 01:09:25.426
[SPEAKER_16]: To which it sounds like most of you guys had a bit of an eh kind of reception.

01:09:25.786 --> 01:09:27.348
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know, I think that's the best way I can say it.

01:09:27.388 --> 01:09:28.769
[SPEAKER_16]: It was kind of an eh reception.

01:09:29.370 --> 01:09:30.371
[SPEAKER_16]: I like the song.

01:09:30.831 --> 01:09:32.032
[SPEAKER_16]: I know Sigurd likes the song.

01:09:32.152 --> 01:09:33.213
[SPEAKER_16]: The rest of you guys are kind of eh.

01:09:33.233 --> 01:09:34.735
[SPEAKER_16]: Here's a little reminder of I Am Gothic.

01:09:46.570 --> 01:09:55.035
[SPEAKER_16]: So, um, now this has already previously been announced on DDRFreaks in the official Ultramix 3 thread.

01:09:55.075 --> 01:09:58.077
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't get to be the first to tell you about this, because we didn't find this, somebody else did.

01:09:58.577 --> 01:10:00.878
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, a user here by the name of Rockus...

01:10:02.339 --> 01:10:06.581
[SPEAKER_16]: who I think is also one of our listeners, so you go, boy, found this one.

01:10:06.821 --> 01:10:14.644
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's actually a link to a magazine website, Virus Magazine, which I think has to do with industrial music.

01:10:15.444 --> 01:10:23.168
[SPEAKER_16]: And sure enough, another band has themselves said that they have a song in Ultramix 3, and it's a band called The Azoic.

01:10:23.648 --> 01:10:28.850
[SPEAKER_16]: The Azoic used to be on Different Drum, and I don't think they're on there anymore, but they used to be on Different Drum.

01:10:29.530 --> 01:10:38.275
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think it's kind of neat that the Azoic is moving over into DDR because I actually bought the Azoic's last album, of which a remix of this song is on.

01:10:38.335 --> 01:10:39.356
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think that's kind of neat.

01:10:40.816 --> 01:10:45.379
[SPEAKER_16]: Based off of samples I heard on a different drum when Ultramix 2 got popular, so I'm kind of excited about that.

01:10:45.759 --> 01:10:49.101
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, the song is called Conflict, and it's the Turmoil mix.

01:10:49.981 --> 01:10:53.982
[SPEAKER_16]: and then the rest of the article talks about how theazoic.com has been down lately.

01:10:54.402 --> 01:10:55.843
[SPEAKER_16]: But at least we get to find out a new song.

01:10:55.883 --> 01:10:59.823
[SPEAKER_16]: So hey, I'm liking this trend since Sigurd won't tell us anything about the song list.

01:11:00.504 --> 01:11:02.244
[SPEAKER_16]: Just kidding, I know you're under contract or whatever.

01:11:03.224 --> 01:11:06.345
[SPEAKER_16]: The artists themselves are starting to spill the beans about the song.

01:11:06.425 --> 01:11:12.006
[SPEAKER_16]: So now we have another confirmed song thanks to a band with a big mouth, The Azoic and Conflict.

01:11:12.187 --> 01:11:13.227
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're going to hear the song.

01:11:13.287 --> 01:11:13.827
[SPEAKER_16]: You guys ready?

01:11:14.778 --> 01:11:15.219
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess.

01:11:15.239 --> 01:11:18.183
[SPEAKER_16]: Because we got it here on Orange Lounge Radio because that's what we do.

01:11:18.443 --> 01:11:20.325
[SPEAKER_16]: We find songs and we play them for you.

01:11:20.546 --> 01:11:20.786
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

01:11:21.006 --> 01:11:23.930
[SPEAKER_16]: So here's a brand new song from DDR Ultramix 3.

01:11:24.872 --> 01:11:26.273
[SPEAKER_16]: The band is called The Ezoic.

01:11:26.694 --> 01:11:28.797
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is Conflict, the turmoil mix.

01:11:29.378 --> 01:11:30.960
[SPEAKER_16]: Here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:11:32.237 --> 01:11:35.100
[SPEAKER_08]: Conflict Confusion Distrust

01:12:03.896 --> 01:12:04.977
Thanks for watching!

01:12:53.109 --> 01:12:53.771
Thanks for watching!

01:14:40.516 --> 01:14:41.597
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

01:15:09.052 --> 01:15:09.934
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

01:16:41.067 --> 01:16:44.408
[SPEAKER_16]: Orange Lounge Radio premiere there of Conflict, the turmoil mix.

01:16:45.188 --> 01:16:49.850
[SPEAKER_16]: Coming up from DDR, Ultramix 3 is going to be the game that has that song in it.

01:16:50.270 --> 01:16:54.192
[SPEAKER_16]: And that was announced by the band, or at least a magazine on behalf of the band.

01:16:54.232 --> 01:16:55.192
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know how that works there.

01:16:55.972 --> 01:16:58.413
[SPEAKER_16]: But the beans were spilled, and there it is.

01:16:58.533 --> 01:16:59.733
[SPEAKER_16]: That song's going to be in Ultramix 3.

01:17:00.374 --> 01:17:00.934
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you guys think?

01:17:00.994 --> 01:17:07.836
[SPEAKER_16]: Now keep in mind, the song there clocks in at five and a half minutes, but they edit these songs down to a minute and a half, two minute range.

01:17:08.176 --> 01:17:09.517
[SPEAKER_16]: You'll get like a verse and a chorus.

01:17:09.577 --> 01:17:09.957
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you think?

01:17:10.322 --> 01:17:11.691
[SPEAKER_19]: Sounds like the stuff they play at Rapture.

01:17:13.078 --> 01:17:19.141
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I think it's kind of ironic that we got last week the I Am Gothic song, which was a little tongue-in-cheek.

01:17:19.521 --> 01:17:22.442
[SPEAKER_16]: It wasn't really a goth song, but it wasn't really anti-goth.

01:17:22.462 --> 01:17:23.263
[SPEAKER_16]: It was just a tongue-in-cheek.

01:17:23.343 --> 01:17:26.404
[SPEAKER_16]: It was a weird owl of goth, I think, to me.

01:17:26.444 --> 01:17:28.325
[SPEAKER_16]: It's kind of synth-pop, I don't know.

01:17:29.026 --> 01:17:29.726
[SPEAKER_16]: In a way, in a way.

01:17:31.207 --> 01:17:33.668
[SPEAKER_16]: We get that song last week, and now we get this this week.

01:17:33.688 --> 01:17:34.728
[SPEAKER_19]: Did they actually play it?

01:17:36.609 --> 01:17:40.911
[SPEAKER_16]: We get an actual industrial goth kind of sounding song that you would hear at a club.

01:17:40.931 --> 01:17:41.231
[SPEAKER_15]: It was cool.

01:17:41.251 --> 01:17:41.591
[SPEAKER_15]: I like it.

01:17:42.432 --> 01:17:42.612
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki.

01:17:43.032 --> 01:17:47.853
[SPEAKER_15]: Are they like suffering or lacking in the goth demographic for DDR or something?

01:17:47.873 --> 01:17:49.214
[SPEAKER_15]: Because this is what it seems like.

01:17:49.274 --> 01:17:55.035
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, how can we get those goths to play a pop dance game?

01:17:55.835 --> 01:17:58.216
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's put some sad music in there.

01:17:59.276 --> 01:17:59.656
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

01:17:59.736 --> 01:18:02.117
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just, it's okay, I guess.

01:18:02.237 --> 01:18:10.499
[SPEAKER_15]: But let's just, hopefully the next few artists that announce that their songs are going to be in there will be a little something different than, say, I don't know, goth music.

01:18:11.530 --> 01:18:17.173
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, now, you know, I'm sure they're going to have a variety of music, as they always do, and Konami's not the one releasing this information, either.

01:18:17.213 --> 01:18:21.715
[SPEAKER_16]: It's coming from the artists themselves, so maybe the gothic bands are just excited about DDR.

01:18:21.755 --> 01:18:22.055
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

01:18:23.116 --> 01:18:27.238
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know what to say about that, so... Well, whatever.

01:18:27.278 --> 01:18:29.139
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it's just... It's okay.

01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:32.121
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't really care for that song too much, actually.

01:18:32.441 --> 01:18:33.961
[SPEAKER_16]: Sigurd, what do you think of The Azohic?

01:18:34.962 --> 01:18:40.685
[SPEAKER_14]: I really, really, really like that song, and it got stuck in my head for about a week when I...

01:18:41.161 --> 01:18:42.685
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm glad it's in the game

01:18:49.144 --> 01:18:51.546
[SPEAKER_16]: Me personally, I'm thrilled that that song made the game.

01:18:52.606 --> 01:19:02.954
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's kind of weird because it's interesting because I'm looking at the chatroom reaction and a lot of folks are saying, you know, I'm liking this, me likey, it's a very upbeat kind of song.

01:19:03.674 --> 01:19:06.977
[SPEAKER_16]: I like this, Arcadian42 says, I hate myself and I want to DDR.

01:19:08.778 --> 01:19:09.018
[SPEAKER_16]: Get it?

01:19:09.038 --> 01:19:10.799
[SPEAKER_16]: Instead of I hate myself and I want to DDR, forget it.

01:19:10.819 --> 01:19:12.761
[SPEAKER_16]: We got it.

01:19:13.101 --> 01:19:13.721
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, yeah, fine.

01:19:15.102 --> 01:19:17.203
[SPEAKER_16]: It's kind of a sad song to me.

01:19:17.243 --> 01:19:19.245
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a very, like, kind of downbeat.

01:19:19.325 --> 01:19:22.987
[SPEAKER_16]: Although it is upbeat, dancey, it's definitely a song that will work for DDR.

01:19:23.367 --> 01:19:25.468
[SPEAKER_16]: It's kind of depressing in a way to me.

01:19:26.489 --> 01:19:34.473
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I think about Ultramix 3's theme and all the happy bubble water theme and the, you know, yeah, it's DDR with all these happy characters.

01:19:35.474 --> 01:19:37.375
[SPEAKER_15]: I love goth music and DDR.

01:19:37.415 --> 01:19:38.616
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to go dry myself now.

01:19:40.717 --> 01:19:41.157
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

01:19:41.237 --> 01:19:43.138
[SPEAKER_16]: It's kind of just interesting.

01:19:44.379 --> 01:19:46.820
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sure not every song is going to be a goth song.

01:19:46.860 --> 01:19:49.001
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's just a coincidence.

01:19:49.021 --> 01:19:50.121
[SPEAKER_19]: We need DDR Dark Mix.

01:19:51.542 --> 01:19:53.542
[SPEAKER_19]: I would so like buy that.

01:19:54.243 --> 01:19:57.924
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm so gothic that I play DDR in dark mode.

01:19:58.444 --> 01:20:01.366
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, DDR Ultra Mix's goth served us.

01:20:04.007 --> 01:20:04.347
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

01:20:05.547 --> 01:20:07.548
[SPEAKER_16]: So we'll see what artist spills the beans next.

01:20:07.888 --> 01:20:08.469
[SPEAKER_16]: My advice...

01:20:09.961 --> 01:20:11.023
[SPEAKER_16]: This is what we've had now.

01:20:11.263 --> 01:20:17.534
[SPEAKER_16]: One, two folks that are somehow related to a different drum, even though maybe directly or not.

01:20:18.004 --> 01:20:19.665
[SPEAKER_16]: Keep an eye on the websites for these guys.

01:20:19.685 --> 01:20:24.770
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't forget that MidiHead is also related to a different drum.

01:20:24.850 --> 01:20:27.792
[SPEAKER_16]: And MidiHead is on a different drum, and we already know that Raise Your Hands is going to be in there.

01:20:27.812 --> 01:20:28.873
[SPEAKER_16]: We played that a few weeks ago.

01:20:29.473 --> 01:20:34.037
[SPEAKER_16]: Also kind of not so much a goth song, but an industrial-ish song.

01:20:34.597 --> 01:20:35.898
[SPEAKER_16]: So kind of interesting.

01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:42.544
[SPEAKER_16]: My advice, keep an eye on those websites, those different drum artists, because one of them is bound to spill the beans next.

01:20:42.584 --> 01:20:43.805
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think three is...

01:20:45.505 --> 01:20:50.989
[SPEAKER_16]: It seems like last time we had more than three different drum licenses, so I'm thinking there's got to be at least a couple more.

01:20:51.169 --> 01:20:51.629
[SPEAKER_16]: So we'll see.

01:20:52.970 --> 01:20:53.230
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

01:20:54.531 --> 01:20:54.992
[SPEAKER_16]: I like this.

01:20:55.032 --> 01:20:56.713
[SPEAKER_16]: Now the chat room is going off on this.

01:20:57.013 --> 01:20:58.734
[SPEAKER_16]: Every time you conform, you lose a bar.

01:21:01.896 --> 01:21:02.376
[SPEAKER_16]: Interesting.

01:21:03.157 --> 01:21:03.477
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

01:21:04.838 --> 01:21:05.338
[SPEAKER_16]: Moving on.

01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:10.282
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's talk about some other big news that's going on in the scene right now.

01:21:11.862 --> 01:21:16.904
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, what happened this week is that Andamiro, or no, I'm sorry, Roxor put out this press release.

01:21:16.984 --> 01:21:19.105
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe it was a joint release with Andamiro, I don't know.

01:21:19.865 --> 01:21:22.526
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's actually a post that's on Roxor's forums.

01:21:23.306 --> 01:21:30.309
[SPEAKER_16]: Roxor Games is proud to announce their partnership with Andamiro Company Limited to create the next generation of arcade dance games.

01:21:30.369 --> 01:21:36.191
[SPEAKER_16]: The first collaboration, quote, Pump It Up, colon, In The Groove 2.

01:21:38.325 --> 01:22:04.448
[SPEAKER_16]: combines, end quote, combines Rockstar's unparalleled gameplay, music, and graphical content with Animero's co-development support and superior cabinet construction featuring blah, blah, blah, flat screen, blah, blah, blah, stereo system, blah, blah, blah, 130 songs, blah, blah, blah, all the songs from the original in the groove, blah, blah, blah, cooperation from Rockstar and Animero, blah, blah, blah, 1,100 dance routines because of all these songs, blah, blah, blah,

01:22:09.846 --> 01:22:13.869
[SPEAKER_16]: Pump It Up in the Groove 2 is now available from game distributors nationwide.

01:22:13.909 --> 01:22:15.351
[SPEAKER_16]: So that was a little bit of a surprise.

01:22:16.271 --> 01:22:19.775
[SPEAKER_16]: No surprise there that Andamiro and Rockstar are going to be working together.

01:22:19.815 --> 01:22:26.381
[SPEAKER_16]: We already knew Andamiro was helping in the cabinets in some capacity, but now In the Groove is part of the Pump It Up series.

01:22:27.870 --> 01:22:28.270
[SPEAKER_16]: Weird?

01:22:29.471 --> 01:22:30.071
[SPEAKER_15]: Not really.

01:22:30.391 --> 01:22:30.891
[SPEAKER_16]: Not really?

01:22:31.172 --> 01:22:31.632
[SPEAKER_15]: What do you think?

01:22:45.228 --> 01:22:54.532
[SPEAKER_16]: I've seen some posts about what is a freeze roll, and I don't remember where I read this, but I do know I read it into what is the freeze roll.

01:22:54.972 --> 01:23:05.536
[SPEAKER_16]: A freeze roll, which is this new thing they're putting in the groove 2, I'm sorry, pump it up in the groove 2, is instead of holding like a freeze arrow, you hold your foot down.

01:23:05.856 --> 01:23:08.497
[SPEAKER_16]: The Freeze Roll is you have to tap your foot repeatedly.

01:23:08.838 --> 01:23:12.520
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, think about Paranoia Survivor Heavy, I think it was.

01:23:12.980 --> 01:23:13.760
[SPEAKER_16]: Was it Paranoia Survivor?

01:23:14.621 --> 01:23:16.302
[SPEAKER_16]: No, no, no.

01:23:16.362 --> 01:23:17.042
[SPEAKER_16]: No, no, no.

01:23:17.062 --> 01:23:18.263
[SPEAKER_16]: Can't Stop Falling in Love is one.

01:23:18.283 --> 01:23:19.203
[SPEAKER_16]: What was the one in Fifth Mix?

01:23:19.904 --> 01:23:20.044
[SPEAKER_16]: The...

01:23:20.916 --> 01:23:22.077
[SPEAKER_15]: Paranoia Eternal

01:23:50.109 --> 01:23:51.350
[SPEAKER_15]: during that freeze time.

01:23:51.490 --> 01:23:54.691
[SPEAKER_15]: It's kind of like Taiko no Tachijin or something like that.

01:23:54.751 --> 01:24:00.313
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, Taiko no Tachijin, the more you hit, or Donkey Konga, the more you hit during one of those rolls, the more points you get.

01:24:00.373 --> 01:24:01.474
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's kind of what it is.

01:24:01.494 --> 01:24:03.515
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, that's not as bad then if it's an incentive.

01:24:03.575 --> 01:24:06.456
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's what it is, but still retarded, whatever.

01:24:06.516 --> 01:24:11.498
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it's... I'm not going to go, oh, that game has freeze rolls, I've got to go play it right now.

01:24:11.558 --> 01:24:13.099
[SPEAKER_15]: Instead, I'm going to go, no.

01:24:13.564 --> 01:24:20.347
[SPEAKER_16]: It's okay, I mean, okay, they want a new idea, here you go, it's a new idea, whatever.

01:24:20.387 --> 01:24:33.452
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm glad though they have the nice widescreen monitor to show off those really bland graphics in a really large size, because, you know, a game like that just really needs the extra monitor space and resolution, because, you know, before...

01:24:33.792 --> 01:24:36.634
[SPEAKER_15]: It couldn't quite show off the bland graphics that were in it.

01:24:36.654 --> 01:24:48.563
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, now, now, in the press release under In the Groove 2, I'm sorry, pump it up, In the Groove 2, under the new features, all new graphics featuring new In the Groove characters.

01:24:48.703 --> 01:24:50.124
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, wow, they're going to be bland too?

01:24:50.444 --> 01:24:57.269
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, all new graphics meaning, we made it red, that's what it is, we made it red, all new graphics.

01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:00.521
[SPEAKER_16]: Featuring in the groove characters.

01:25:00.621 --> 01:25:02.903
[SPEAKER_16]: Where have I seen dancing characters before?

01:25:03.023 --> 01:25:07.847
[SPEAKER_19]: Where did I... Maybe it was in... Where did I see that?

01:25:08.307 --> 01:25:09.608
[SPEAKER_19]: I know it was in Maniac Mansion.

01:25:09.728 --> 01:25:11.049
[SPEAKER_16]: That's right, it was in Maniac Mansion.

01:25:11.490 --> 01:25:13.251
[SPEAKER_16]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:25:13.271 --> 01:25:14.572
[SPEAKER_16]: It was the Jungle Beat game.

01:25:16.273 --> 01:25:17.814
[SPEAKER_16]: Jungle Book, Jungle Beat Games.

01:25:34.995 --> 01:25:36.836
[SPEAKER_15]: Speaking of which, I got a funny story about that later.

01:25:37.156 --> 01:25:38.256
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

01:25:39.237 --> 01:25:39.537
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see.

01:25:39.657 --> 01:25:41.677
[SPEAKER_16]: Unlockable songs and expert steps.

01:25:42.098 --> 01:25:45.039
[SPEAKER_16]: Greatly expanded compatibility for USB memory cards.

01:25:45.059 --> 01:25:53.222
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I was reading somewhere where the USB will now not only download your scores, but the whole damn arcade high scores will go on your USB card.

01:25:53.682 --> 01:25:53.982
[SPEAKER_16]: Which is...

01:25:54.742 --> 01:25:55.683
[SPEAKER_16]: Interesting, I guess.

01:25:55.723 --> 01:26:07.829
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think they're trying to formulate this way of doing like a national ranking, which, you know what, one thing I really like about In The Groove, and I give them a lot of credit for, the USB support is phenomenal, and I wish DDR had something like it.

01:26:07.869 --> 01:26:11.951
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'll give them that, and I'm interested to see how they expand on the USB support.

01:26:11.971 --> 01:26:13.051
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's exciting news to me.

01:26:14.572 --> 01:26:20.895
[SPEAKER_16]: Novice difficulty with helpers like Traffic Light and Constant Scroll to assist players who are just getting started.

01:26:22.307 --> 01:26:24.009
[SPEAKER_16]: I have no idea what that means, but okay.

01:26:24.049 --> 01:26:25.690
[SPEAKER_16]: Traffic Light, that sounds interesting.

01:26:28.493 --> 01:26:31.855
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see, 65 new songs.

01:26:33.357 --> 01:26:48.210
[SPEAKER_16]: This is one other thing I like about In The Groove versus DDR, because how many times has your DDR machine been reset at the local arcade, and you cannot get the stupid arcade operator to put in the code to unlock Stoic and all that stuff,

01:26:49.033 --> 01:26:53.335
[SPEAKER_16]: because, you know, they do an outside vending company or something so nobody will open the machine.

01:26:53.515 --> 01:26:54.976
[SPEAKER_16]: Even if you know the code, you can't put it in.

01:26:55.276 --> 01:27:05.081
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, one thing I like about what In The Groove does and Pump It Up In The Groove 2 is going to continue is that the unlock codes are actually entered by the players via the dance pad.

01:27:05.101 --> 01:27:06.422
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think that's good.

01:27:06.922 --> 01:27:07.462
[SPEAKER_16]: Smart idea.

01:27:08.103 --> 01:27:13.726
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's coming back and all that stuff that you've come to know and love or whatever about In The Groove.

01:27:14.846 --> 01:27:16.287
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, any more hateful thoughts?

01:27:17.561 --> 01:27:24.678
[SPEAKER_15]: I got something that's not exactly... It's in the groove news, but it's not related to this particular in the groove news.

01:27:25.074 --> 01:27:26.115
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, well, try me.

01:27:26.955 --> 01:27:36.481
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, well, it was basically Indigrew was saying, Oh, our, you know, our encryption is kick-ass and no one will be able to defeat it, yadda yadda yadda.

01:27:36.901 --> 01:27:39.403
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, actually, no, it was not.

01:27:40.404 --> 01:27:54.052
[SPEAKER_15]: Because as soon as the game came out for the PlayStation 2, the entire theme, all the movies, and all the music, and all the steps, and everything else were ripped down.

01:27:54.432 --> 01:28:02.779
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if it's so much that as the fact as when people say, we have a great encryption scheme that nobody will be able to hack.

01:28:19.833 --> 01:28:22.015
[SPEAKER_16]: That is inviting people to come in and hack it.

01:28:24.657 --> 01:28:41.271
[SPEAKER_16]: I can think of examples that have nothing to do with video games, such as the CD companies, like Sony and stuff, when they said, oh, we're going to put out these copy-protected CDs, and you will not be able to copy these CDs no matter what you do, because it launches a program when you put the CD in, and you can't copy the CDs.

01:28:41.926 --> 01:28:44.408
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, here's the magic workaround that somebody found.

01:28:44.468 --> 01:28:44.828
[SPEAKER_16]: Get this.

01:28:45.328 --> 01:28:48.891
[SPEAKER_16]: Hold the shift key when you put in the CD to abort the auto-run feature.

01:28:49.431 --> 01:28:50.672
[SPEAKER_16]: Copy protection aborted.

01:28:51.713 --> 01:28:58.058
[SPEAKER_16]: So, when somebody says we cannot be hacked, that is just an invite to somebody to hack them.

01:28:58.818 --> 01:29:01.200
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to laugh, because basically here's what it is.

01:29:01.658 --> 01:29:01.898
[SPEAKER_15]: and so on.

01:29:20.424 --> 01:29:21.224
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, we've done it.

01:29:21.624 --> 01:29:25.006
[SPEAKER_15]: We've done what those rocks or bastards claim to be impossible.

01:29:25.226 --> 01:29:34.049
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, we have cracked the encryption, in quotes, that houses the game's files using tools made in-house by our cracking experts.

01:29:34.509 --> 01:29:40.552
[SPEAKER_15]: Since In The Groove is just a rip-off of StepMania, the files were easily portable to the StepMania layout.

01:29:40.692 --> 01:29:46.834
[SPEAKER_15]: This SMZIP file contains songs, supporting graphics for use in StepMania.

01:29:47.793 --> 01:29:50.757
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, now I'm sure a lot of In The Groove fans are going rabble, rabble, rabble at that.

01:29:50.817 --> 01:29:55.222
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know, that's just some kids showing off their internet penis because they cracked it.

01:29:55.263 --> 01:29:55.903
[SPEAKER_16]: Hooray for you.

01:29:55.983 --> 01:29:56.424
[SPEAKER_16]: Good job.

01:29:56.464 --> 01:29:56.784
[SPEAKER_16]: Whatever.

01:29:57.966 --> 01:29:59.027
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't take it too personally.

01:30:00.469 --> 01:30:01.170
[SPEAKER_16]: That type of stuff.

01:30:02.131 --> 01:30:03.093
[SPEAKER_15]: It's quite funny, but...

01:30:04.147 --> 01:30:09.592
[SPEAKER_15]: But basically, you can actually see some rips here on ITGFreak.com.

01:30:09.812 --> 01:30:10.513
[SPEAKER_15]: How appropriate.

01:30:11.233 --> 01:30:13.375
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, how appropriate that they'd be on there.

01:30:14.296 --> 01:30:15.337
[SPEAKER_15]: And they're pretty much perfect.

01:30:16.057 --> 01:30:18.219
[SPEAKER_15]: Granted, there's some little tweaks.

01:30:18.339 --> 01:30:21.602
[SPEAKER_16]: Are the loading times improved when you played in Step Mania?

01:30:22.103 --> 01:30:22.403
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess.

01:30:23.007 --> 01:30:29.951
[SPEAKER_15]: And what was up with the whole, I don't know, in the groove, like corrupting your save file or something like that?

01:30:30.551 --> 01:30:32.852
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm surprised that this game was so polished.

01:30:33.012 --> 01:30:50.562
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I would expect something from such a game that, you know... Now, now, now, somebody could just come up just as easily and say, you're just picking on him now, because somebody could easily come up and say, whoa, in DDR Extreme they have a whole song that was supposed to be unlocked that you can't get, da-da-da, you know, the memories debacle.

01:30:51.038 --> 01:30:51.358
[SPEAKER_16]: Whatever.

01:30:51.499 --> 01:30:55.823
[SPEAKER_15]: No, that was basically, you know, cut out the game, but some of the stuff is still in the code.

01:30:55.883 --> 01:30:59.788
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not... My save file gets erased because that song is not in the game.

01:31:00.929 --> 01:31:02.510
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, okay, I'll give you that.

01:31:02.530 --> 01:31:03.712
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a slight difference there.

01:31:03.772 --> 01:31:04.092
[SPEAKER_16]: There is.

01:31:04.312 --> 01:31:05.614
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry, I mean...

01:31:06.601 --> 01:31:07.922
[SPEAKER_16]: But you're picking on him.

01:31:08.322 --> 01:31:08.942
[SPEAKER_15]: You're picking on him.

01:31:08.962 --> 01:31:12.143
[SPEAKER_15]: The groove looks like something that someone would make homebrew for the Dreamcast.

01:31:12.223 --> 01:31:13.464
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, this is what it looks like.

01:31:13.504 --> 01:31:15.505
[SPEAKER_15]: This game is just crap.

01:31:15.665 --> 01:31:16.085
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

01:31:16.285 --> 01:31:17.006
[SPEAKER_15]: It is crap.

01:31:17.046 --> 01:31:18.586
[SPEAKER_16]: Look, we got enough hate mail last week.

01:31:19.046 --> 01:31:23.588
[SPEAKER_16]: Sigurd, what do you think of Pump It Up in the Groove 2?

01:31:24.109 --> 01:31:25.429
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'll say it for you.

01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:28.751
[SPEAKER_16]: What Sigurd says does not reflect in any way, shape, or form Konami.

01:31:28.791 --> 01:31:29.351
[SPEAKER_16]: Da-da-da-da-da.

01:31:29.611 --> 01:31:37.756
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm very angry about it, because as everybody should know by now, um, or maybe they don't, I'm a huge fan of Pump It Up.

01:31:38.196 --> 01:31:44.600
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, half of me is dedicated to Konami, but the other half is all for Pump It Up and everything to do with Pump It Up.

01:31:45.481 --> 01:31:56.948
[SPEAKER_14]: And so when I heard this, I wanted to cry, because the half of me that loves Pump It Up could stay out of the Konami vs. Rocksword debate, and it could just go play Pump It Up, but now it has to, uh,

01:31:57.355 --> 01:32:05.500
[SPEAKER_14]: Get Involved, because apparently Endemira wanted to get sued again by Konami, or vice versa, or however that crappy lawsuit went.

01:32:06.241 --> 01:32:08.242
[SPEAKER_14]: But, yeah, I don't like it.

01:32:08.882 --> 01:32:16.027
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've even tried Pump recently, or not Pump, Indigroo recently, and I'm still very angry about all this.

01:32:16.707 --> 01:32:18.008
[SPEAKER_14]: I played Indigroo today.

01:32:18.608 --> 01:32:19.909
[SPEAKER_14]: So did I. Yeah.

01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:21.450
[SPEAKER_14]: They sucked.

01:32:22.971 --> 01:32:23.251
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh well.

01:32:24.792 --> 01:32:32.675
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh yeah, that was funny, because on my first song I got a star, because I got like a 96% or something, and Secret's all, you got a star?

01:32:33.055 --> 01:32:34.496
[SPEAKER_16]: You can get a star in this game?

01:32:35.336 --> 01:32:37.036
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm like, dude, they let you work on DDR?

01:32:37.296 --> 01:32:40.057
[SPEAKER_16]: My DDR skills have seriously declined.

01:32:40.478 --> 01:32:41.418
[SPEAKER_16]: But no, I think that's good.

01:32:41.438 --> 01:32:44.259
[SPEAKER_16]: That goes to show that you don't have to be a DDR expert.

01:32:44.839 --> 01:32:48.760
[SPEAKER_16]: or whatever to play, you know, you don't have to be able to triple A everything in order to work on DDR.

01:32:48.800 --> 01:33:04.484
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't really played DDR, like, for real in years, so it's amazing that I even got an A-, or an S-, or whatever that crappy letter thing they had on in the groove was, but yeah, I'm just very bitter about this whole thing, and I don't want Pump It Up's name attached to, uh,

01:33:05.382 --> 01:33:08.204
[SPEAKER_14]: In The Groove, because I like Pump It Up and I don't like In The Groove.

01:33:08.284 --> 01:33:09.305
[SPEAKER_14]: But I like In The Groove songs.

01:33:09.945 --> 01:33:11.226
[SPEAKER_14]: Land of the Rising Sun is cool.

01:33:12.106 --> 01:33:14.888
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's... And The Roots, that's about it.

01:33:15.749 --> 01:33:16.429
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Loki.

01:33:17.670 --> 01:33:18.550
[SPEAKER_15]: Be good.

01:33:18.910 --> 01:33:24.734
[SPEAKER_15]: Why the hell would Endemiro want to, like, shame themselves, you know, by putting Pump It Up in front of this game?

01:33:25.214 --> 01:33:32.039
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, honestly, unless... Unless, you know, the whole creative team behind Pump It Up went and redesigned their whole interface and said...

01:33:32.959 --> 01:33:35.681
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, yeah, we like what you did, but we got a few... No, no, no.

01:33:36.161 --> 01:33:37.842
[SPEAKER_16]: Say what you will about the In The Groove interface.

01:33:38.102 --> 01:33:39.964
[SPEAKER_16]: Pumps is way worse.

01:33:40.204 --> 01:33:42.145
[SPEAKER_16]: Pump has one of the worst interfaces ever.

01:33:42.185 --> 01:33:43.326
[SPEAKER_16]: That is a lie.

01:33:43.386 --> 01:33:44.366
[SPEAKER_16]: That is a total truth.

01:33:44.386 --> 01:33:45.647
[SPEAKER_14]: That is a lie.

01:33:45.667 --> 01:33:46.848
[SPEAKER_14]: Pump It Up has it great.

01:33:46.948 --> 01:33:47.929
[SPEAKER_14]: I speak the truth.

01:33:47.989 --> 01:33:48.389
[SPEAKER_14]: Get over it.

01:33:48.669 --> 01:33:53.312
[SPEAKER_14]: They have the songs classified by channels, the Banya channel, the K-pop channel, and the pop channel.

01:33:53.352 --> 01:33:54.533
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't get much easier than that.

01:33:54.833 --> 01:33:59.696
[SPEAKER_14]: The only thing wrong with it is that you have to put all the codes in via your foot, and that gets annoying.

01:34:00.076 --> 01:34:09.681
[SPEAKER_14]: But also, when you're talking about In The Groove 2, having the codes with the feet to unlock the songs, Pump It Up does that too, so that's no surprise.

01:34:10.121 --> 01:34:10.361
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

01:34:11.138 --> 01:34:16.942
[SPEAKER_15]: Which interface looks like it came out of my ass, and which one looks like it was actually worked on by a professional software team?

01:34:17.082 --> 01:34:17.943
[SPEAKER_16]: I would beg to differ.

01:34:18.143 --> 01:34:20.044
[SPEAKER_16]: I cannot stand Pump It Up's interface.

01:34:20.164 --> 01:34:20.865
[SPEAKER_16]: I hate it.

01:34:20.885 --> 01:34:21.605
[SPEAKER_15]: It's horrible.

01:34:21.665 --> 01:34:26.208
[SPEAKER_15]: Interface, technicalities aside, I'm not talking about the way the interface functions.

01:34:26.268 --> 01:34:28.650
[SPEAKER_15]: Just pure aesthetic value of it.

01:34:28.670 --> 01:34:31.272
[SPEAKER_16]: Why don't you just say, which game has run to you in it?

01:34:31.912 --> 01:34:33.173
[SPEAKER_16]: Because that sells me right there.

01:34:33.193 --> 01:34:33.593
[SPEAKER_16]: That's enough.

01:34:33.613 --> 01:34:34.654
[SPEAKER_19]: Pump It Up doesn't anymore.

01:34:35.274 --> 01:34:35.815
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, that's true.

01:34:37.996 --> 01:34:39.777
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, you've been offered quiet over there.

01:34:39.817 --> 01:34:41.398
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you think about this whole debacle?

01:34:42.298 --> 01:34:45.720
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not going to give any of them my business, so that's all there is to it.

01:34:46.260 --> 01:34:47.260
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought you liked Pump It Up.

01:34:48.941 --> 01:34:50.442
[SPEAKER_19]: I liked it before they sullied their name.

01:34:52.663 --> 01:34:53.163
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, snap.

01:34:53.223 --> 01:34:55.905
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that kind of gives her opinion right there.

01:34:56.145 --> 01:35:00.587
[SPEAKER_15]: This would be like putting Dance Dance Revolution's George Foreman grill.

01:35:00.607 --> 01:35:02.768
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, there's really no point in doing...

01:35:04.443 --> 01:35:08.525
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, hold on a minute, because I'm actually going to think this out here, okay?

01:35:08.585 --> 01:35:11.086
[SPEAKER_16]: Just be careful, there might be steam that arises from my head or something.

01:35:11.586 --> 01:35:12.186
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, let's see.

01:35:13.426 --> 01:35:14.747
[SPEAKER_16]: I have a dancing game.

01:35:15.747 --> 01:35:17.368
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm Andamiro, and I have a dancing game.

01:35:17.468 --> 01:35:21.950
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's not catching on the same way that my competitor's dancing game is catching on.

01:35:22.870 --> 01:35:24.971
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, now, wait for a minute.

01:35:25.691 --> 01:35:27.272
[SPEAKER_16]: I am another company who...

01:35:28.584 --> 01:35:35.570
[SPEAKER_16]: borrowed heavily a lot of ideas from the competitor and put it into its own game and tried to improve upon it, and now I'm getting sued.

01:35:35.890 --> 01:35:39.754
[SPEAKER_16]: So here we are, we've got the number one, the king of dance games, Konami.

01:35:39.774 --> 01:35:41.755
[SPEAKER_16]: You can't dispute that, Konami sells the most.

01:35:42.296 --> 01:35:46.900
[SPEAKER_16]: You argue why you want the quality of the games, but in terms of sales, Konami is tops.

01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:53.165
[SPEAKER_16]: So number two and number three want to join forces to take out number one.

01:35:54.366 --> 01:35:55.107
[SPEAKER_16]: Where's the...

01:35:56.673 --> 01:36:00.274
[SPEAKER_16]: Where's the... That doesn't make sense in that, because it makes total sense to me.

01:36:00.394 --> 01:36:00.874
[SPEAKER_19]: It's war.

01:36:01.735 --> 01:36:02.855
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it's number two and number three.

01:36:02.895 --> 01:36:03.455
[SPEAKER_19]: Ever pay risk?

01:36:04.556 --> 01:36:04.836
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

01:36:07.237 --> 01:36:09.557
[SPEAKER_16]: Number two and number three are joining forces to take out number one.

01:36:10.198 --> 01:36:14.419
[SPEAKER_16]: Just like GameStop and EB merged to take out Walmart, right?

01:36:15.757 --> 01:36:18.038
[SPEAKER_14]: The thing is, though, this is only the arcade aspect.

01:36:18.398 --> 01:36:22.259
[SPEAKER_14]: I have not seen numbers on how well In The Groove has sold on the PS2.

01:36:22.639 --> 01:36:24.099
[SPEAKER_14]: DDR still sells really well.

01:36:25.419 --> 01:36:28.220
[SPEAKER_14]: Pump It Up still hasn't come out here yet, so we can't judge that.

01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:37.122
[SPEAKER_14]: So, they might fight for the dying arcade market, but who's to say that this collaboration will have any impact on the home version.

01:36:37.823 --> 01:36:38.623
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, good point.

01:36:39.003 --> 01:36:43.424
[SPEAKER_15]: You can put 50 additional names in front of this goddamn game and it's still not going to make it one ounce better.

01:36:45.930 --> 01:36:47.191
[SPEAKER_16]: Just a big ball of hate, Loki.

01:36:47.751 --> 01:36:48.412
[SPEAKER_16]: Big ball of hate.

01:36:50.373 --> 01:36:50.734
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

01:36:51.014 --> 01:36:52.375
[SPEAKER_19]: In this case, it's a little deserved.

01:36:54.697 --> 01:36:55.698
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, you guys.

01:36:57.079 --> 01:36:58.800
[SPEAKER_16]: This is why we lost all the listeners.

01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:00.001
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, listen, listen.

01:37:00.061 --> 01:37:03.003
[SPEAKER_15]: If they make a good game, I'll give it, you know, good reviews.

01:37:03.063 --> 01:37:05.445
[SPEAKER_15]: But if the games suck, I'm going to tell you how it is.

01:37:05.465 --> 01:37:06.086
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, wait a minute.

01:37:06.146 --> 01:37:06.686
[SPEAKER_16]: Wait a minute.

01:37:06.866 --> 01:37:07.327
[SPEAKER_16]: Wait a minute.

01:37:07.387 --> 01:37:07.727
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello.

01:37:08.948 --> 01:37:12.651
[SPEAKER_16]: To the game's credit, you haven't played Pump It Up in the Groove 2 yet.

01:37:12.891 --> 01:37:13.312
[SPEAKER_16]: Correct?

01:37:14.032 --> 01:37:14.873
[SPEAKER_16]: So you don't know yet.

01:37:15.911 --> 01:37:18.392
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you going to give it at least one playthrough?

01:37:18.893 --> 01:37:19.793
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll play it once.

01:37:20.593 --> 01:37:20.754
[SPEAKER_15]: Once.

01:37:21.314 --> 01:37:24.075
[SPEAKER_15]: Just to get a taste of how crappy it is.

01:37:24.575 --> 01:37:27.177
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I'll just let you know how it is again.

01:37:28.735 --> 01:37:31.076
[SPEAKER_16]: But you have to go in there with an impartial view.

01:37:31.817 --> 01:37:36.280
[SPEAKER_16]: As the media... Let's put it this way.

01:37:36.460 --> 01:37:37.120
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me put it this way.

01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:43.144
[SPEAKER_15]: As I've seen how it started off as really shitty, it should be pretty easy to impress me then.

01:37:43.644 --> 01:37:45.065
[SPEAKER_15]: It's got to be better than crap.

01:37:45.305 --> 01:37:48.207
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so that's a pretty easy goal to hit.

01:37:48.587 --> 01:37:50.689
[SPEAKER_15]: If they can't do that, I'm sorry.

01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:51.469
[SPEAKER_16]: You're the media.

01:37:51.509 --> 01:37:54.071
[SPEAKER_16]: You need to be impartial like Fox News Channel.

01:37:55.231 --> 01:37:56.471
[SPEAKER_16]: Snicker, snicker, snort.

01:37:57.172 --> 01:38:00.872
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, only those dirty Republicans play in the group too, okay?

01:38:05.353 --> 01:38:05.814
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that better?

01:38:05.834 --> 01:38:06.874
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that impartial enough?

01:38:09.034 --> 01:38:10.555
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know what to tell you anymore, Loki.

01:38:10.595 --> 01:38:13.835
[SPEAKER_16]: I just don't... Alright.

01:38:17.916 --> 01:38:18.896
[SPEAKER_19]: They can have their pump it up.

01:38:19.257 --> 01:38:20.257
[SPEAKER_19]: I have macadamia nuts.

01:38:20.617 --> 01:38:21.117
[SPEAKER_19]: Everyone's happy.

01:38:22.034 --> 01:38:23.255
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope this doesn't last.

01:38:23.735 --> 01:38:25.556
[SPEAKER_14]: I want them to split up really bad.

01:38:25.576 --> 01:38:27.037
[SPEAKER_14]: You want them to argue and fight about this?

01:38:27.097 --> 01:38:35.721
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I want Andamira to realize their wrongs and punch Roxor in the face and take all their money, all four dollars.

01:38:37.282 --> 01:38:42.365
[SPEAKER_16]: I think the new cabinets are interesting.

01:38:44.729 --> 01:38:54.983
[SPEAKER_16]: I think they're kind of ugly, but I think they're interesting because they're really big, and I like big things, so I'm kind of curious to see what... They're so interesting, it's like putting a DDR pad on a pump-it-up cabinet.

01:38:55.043 --> 01:38:55.944
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh wait, that's what it is!

01:38:58.274 --> 01:39:03.695
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow, that's... How are we going to make this four panel with the pump-it-up cabinet?

01:39:04.815 --> 01:39:05.475
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I got it.

01:39:05.775 --> 01:39:06.235
[SPEAKER_15]: There we go.

01:39:06.495 --> 01:39:07.096
[SPEAKER_15]: That was easy.

01:39:08.496 --> 01:39:13.397
[SPEAKER_14]: And this way now, they can get around selling those boxers, because you can just put it in a pump cabinet and replace the pad.

01:39:13.457 --> 01:39:26.039
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, yeah, they're not going to get sued over this one, unless... Unless Andamiro's smart and realizes they're so horrible for doing this and decides to drop the name and then sue them for putting stuff in their arcade machines.

01:39:26.059 --> 01:39:27.399
[SPEAKER_14]: I hate Roxor.

01:39:30.437 --> 01:39:30.717
[SPEAKER_12]: Whatever.

01:39:31.878 --> 01:39:32.258
[SPEAKER_12]: Moving on.

01:39:33.419 --> 01:39:34.861
[SPEAKER_16]: In the group, fans, I'm sorry.

01:39:35.221 --> 01:39:39.785
[SPEAKER_16]: I tried to argue your case here, but Loki just won't budge one bit.

01:39:39.965 --> 01:39:40.666
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry, guys.

01:39:41.086 --> 01:39:41.627
[SPEAKER_16]: What can I say?

01:39:42.648 --> 01:39:42.968
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

01:39:43.869 --> 01:39:44.870
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's go on to a new topic.

01:39:44.890 --> 01:39:46.591
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's get into tonight's cage match, shall we?

01:39:48.573 --> 01:39:49.253
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, we don't have to.

01:39:50.374 --> 01:39:52.136
[SPEAKER_19]: I was nodding, but no one heard it on the radio.

01:39:52.156 --> 01:39:52.416
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry.

01:39:52.536 --> 01:39:52.817
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

01:39:56.021 --> 01:40:12.570
[SPEAKER_16]: The way the Orange Lounge Radio Cage match works, we play three songs for you guys, one that each host selects, and the winning song, as voted by you guys, goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Video Game Music and More program, which plays 24 hours a day, seven days a week on this station.

01:40:12.671 --> 01:40:13.431
[SPEAKER_16]: We are not live.

01:40:13.911 --> 01:40:18.874
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you get to hear a clip of last week's song and two new songs in their entirety.

01:40:18.934 --> 01:40:20.155
[SPEAKER_16]: So let's hear first...

01:40:21.055 --> 01:40:22.956
[SPEAKER_16]: The song that won last week.

01:40:23.036 --> 01:40:23.696
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a clip.

01:40:24.777 --> 01:40:26.518
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a remix by Loki.

01:40:27.118 --> 01:40:29.819
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's echo image remix by Loki.

01:40:30.159 --> 01:40:32.881
[SPEAKER_16]: Skulk, the Misunderstood Mix is what it was called, I believe.

01:40:33.161 --> 01:40:33.681
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't remember.

01:40:33.721 --> 01:40:35.442
[SPEAKER_15]: I just renamed it again, so whatever.

01:40:35.462 --> 01:40:38.483
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I think the MP3 says Misunderstood Mix, so that's what we're going to call it.

01:40:38.523 --> 01:40:40.324
[SPEAKER_16]: So here it is, a clip of song number one.

01:40:40.344 --> 01:40:42.846
[SPEAKER_16]: Remember, you have to be in our chat room, www.orangehuntradio.com.

[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, here it is.

01:40:46.913 --> 01:40:47.755
[SPEAKER_16]: Song number one.

01:40:48.236 --> 01:40:50.281
[SPEAKER_16]: Echo Image Remix by Loki.

01:40:50.381 --> 01:40:51.724
[SPEAKER_16]: Skulk, the Misunderstood Mix.

01:42:42.563 --> 01:42:48.065
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, that was song number one, Echo Image Remix by Loki, Skulk, The Misunderstood Mix.

01:42:48.165 --> 01:42:50.546
[SPEAKER_16]: That was the song you guys voted as the winner last week.

01:42:50.606 --> 01:42:57.528
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see if it can hang on two weeks in a row, or if it gets dethroned by one of the new entries in tonight's cage match.

01:42:57.548 --> 01:42:58.669
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I'll start tonight.

01:42:59.049 --> 01:43:00.469
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, you can bring up the rear.

01:43:02.650 --> 01:43:05.011
[SPEAKER_19]: Wait, isn't that supposed to... okay.

01:43:05.802 --> 01:43:07.042
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, ha ha ha, I get it.

01:43:07.062 --> 01:43:08.343
[SPEAKER_16]: Ha ha ha, I get it.

01:43:08.643 --> 01:43:08.963
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

01:43:09.703 --> 01:43:16.026
[SPEAKER_16]: My choice tonight, I like that I Am Gothic song so much last week that I had to dig up some more songs by Spray.

01:43:16.406 --> 01:43:17.646
[SPEAKER_16]: And I really like this song.

01:43:17.726 --> 01:43:20.367
[SPEAKER_16]: And DarkSakura, I know you're going to like this one.

01:43:20.427 --> 01:43:20.948
[SPEAKER_16]: You have to.

01:43:21.408 --> 01:43:21.868
[SPEAKER_16]: You have to.

01:43:21.928 --> 01:43:22.788
[SPEAKER_19]: Do I have to?

01:43:22.808 --> 01:43:23.348
[SPEAKER_16]: You have to.

01:43:23.709 --> 01:43:26.570
[SPEAKER_16]: Because this is a song called I Kill With My Car.

01:43:27.710 --> 01:43:28.370
[SPEAKER_16]: I like it already.

01:43:28.510 --> 01:43:29.251
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, let's hear it.

01:43:29.331 --> 01:43:32.572
[SPEAKER_16]: Song number two in tonight's Cage Match, Spray with I Kill With My Car.

01:44:45.410 --> 01:44:50.918
[SPEAKER_08]: You're my baby, hot and sweet Hurling tension and thunder Grinding pets and kids to dust

01:45:19.135 --> 01:45:19.977
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

01:45:48.013 --> 01:45:49.943
Thanks for watching!

01:46:45.219 --> 01:46:48.023
[SPEAKER_16]: Song number two, I Kill With My Car.

01:46:49.025 --> 01:46:50.326
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you think, DarkSakura?

01:46:53.151 --> 01:46:55.234
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't pull a Simon tonight, I'm sorry.

01:46:56.335 --> 01:46:57.297
[SPEAKER_19]: It gets to nine and a half.

01:46:58.263 --> 01:47:01.025
[SPEAKER_19]: Just because there was a bit of repetition, but it was pretty cool.

01:47:01.085 --> 01:47:02.365
[SPEAKER_19]: And you have to email that to me now.

01:47:02.546 --> 01:47:04.367
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh my god, she liked one of my songs.

01:47:05.047 --> 01:47:06.388
[SPEAKER_19]: It wasn't Crap Trance!

01:47:07.128 --> 01:47:10.490
[SPEAKER_19]: Every week, it's like, let's pick something really poppy.

01:47:10.650 --> 01:47:12.291
[SPEAKER_08]: I like a lot of Crap Trance.

01:47:12.351 --> 01:47:19.515
[SPEAKER_19]: Or Crap Trance, or less than Crap Trance, or what's your face?

01:47:19.895 --> 01:47:20.616
[SPEAKER_19]: Kelly Osbourne.

01:47:22.537 --> 01:47:23.597
[SPEAKER_16]: Which is just crap, period.

01:47:23.838 --> 01:47:26.299
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, let's just see if I went over Loki.

01:47:27.489 --> 01:47:28.130
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

01:47:28.770 --> 01:47:29.271
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

01:47:29.331 --> 01:47:31.913
[SPEAKER_15]: It's gonna get a 5 because it wasn't Crap Trance.

01:47:32.473 --> 01:47:36.337
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I was really expecting Crap Trance, and this was not Crap Trance.

01:47:36.897 --> 01:47:38.359
[SPEAKER_15]: So, it gets a 5.

01:47:38.619 --> 01:47:39.940
[SPEAKER_15]: That and the fact- FUCK YOU BOTH!

01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:41.121
[SPEAKER_15]: FUCK YOU BOTH!

01:47:41.241 --> 01:47:42.242
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all I have to say.

01:47:42.362 --> 01:47:43.063
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck you both.

01:47:48.047 --> 01:47:48.528
[SPEAKER_16]: Seegurd.

01:47:49.188 --> 01:47:48.528
10.

01:47:50.069 --> 01:47:50.509
[SPEAKER_14]: Spray.

01:47:50.629 --> 01:47:51.310
[SPEAKER_14]: I like them.

01:47:52.171 --> 01:47:52.851
[SPEAKER_14]: Extifer.

01:47:52.991 --> 01:47:53.512
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you think?

01:47:55.097 --> 01:47:59.039
[SPEAKER_16]: 5 years ago, I was on a rampage looking for Dr. Bombay stuff.

01:47:59.079 --> 01:48:03.581
[SPEAKER_16]: Instead, I downloaded a song which, to my delight, was by somebody that I really liked.

01:48:03.641 --> 01:48:06.142
[SPEAKER_16]: I downloaded a song by Del the Funky Homo Sapien called Dr. Bombay.

01:48:24.349 --> 01:48:37.919
[SPEAKER_19]: And I like the song, so, cause Del's cool So, and of course, this, I didn't even realize until after I picked the song And I already emailed it, I was like, oh, Gorillaz Connection, but Oh well, hey The song's cool What's new?

[SPEAKER_10]: and I'm a pin the tail on the bump as anybody

[SPEAKER_10]: The Force, y'all know who I am, so girl sing the chorus

01:51:44.582 --> 01:51:52.486
[SPEAKER_10]: And get up off your knees, everything that Dr. Bombay says It's guaranteed to make you say, so who's the side to hit?

01:51:52.626 --> 01:52:13.378
[SPEAKER_10]: I like club men hanging out with the Dems And girl, if you ain't got a turn I won't hesitate to pull out my funky puns But if you ain't down with Delfon Cancel your appointment and please get the hell on Cause I won't have fudge with gold Under my nose if you want 80% to close Get out my way so I can save the day Cause I'm Dr. Bombay

01:53:34.051 --> 01:53:37.912
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, that was Dell the Funky Homo Sapien with Dr. Bombay.

01:53:38.012 --> 01:53:40.653
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see if the doctor is in or out permanently.

01:53:41.133 --> 01:53:41.914
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura.

01:53:42.934 --> 01:53:45.895
[SPEAKER_19]: I could have picked better, but I've been listening to this song a lot today, so it gets a 9.

01:53:47.475 --> 01:53:48.516
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, Loki.

01:53:50.596 --> 01:53:51.777
[SPEAKER_15]: It gets a 9, too.

01:53:51.817 --> 01:53:52.317
[SPEAKER_15]: It's pretty cool.

01:53:54.138 --> 01:53:55.298
[SPEAKER_16]: But it wasn't Trance.

01:53:57.482 --> 01:53:58.843
[SPEAKER_16]: You're an ass.

01:53:58.883 --> 01:54:00.324
[SPEAKER_18]: You're an ass.

01:54:00.384 --> 01:54:00.724
[SPEAKER_18]: Right?

01:54:01.885 --> 01:54:03.086
[SPEAKER_18]: He doesn't expect this from me.

01:54:03.126 --> 01:54:03.226
[SPEAKER_14]: Ass.

01:54:03.766 --> 01:54:04.146
[SPEAKER_14]: Sigurd.

01:54:04.967 --> 01:54:07.068
[SPEAKER_14]: It made me think of Bustamove and Ham.

01:54:07.649 --> 01:54:11.071
[SPEAKER_14]: So, if he were in another game, he would have had that as a theme song.

01:54:11.111 --> 01:54:11.711
[SPEAKER_14]: So it gets a 8.

01:54:13.892 --> 01:54:16.874
[SPEAKER_16]: That gets a resounding WTFF from me.

01:54:17.375 --> 01:54:19.756
[SPEAKER_16]: But, it was actually kind of funky.

01:54:19.836 --> 01:54:21.417
[SPEAKER_16]: It was like, what the funky fuck.

01:54:21.537 --> 01:54:22.718
[SPEAKER_16]: So, it wasn't bad.

01:54:23.658 --> 01:54:25.540
[SPEAKER_16]: I think they should have music like that in DDR.

01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:25.820
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

01:54:27.798 --> 01:54:29.139
[SPEAKER_16]: I completely agree.

01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:32.242
[SPEAKER_16]: They need to mix the goth music up with stuff like that.

01:54:33.062 --> 01:54:33.983
[SPEAKER_18]: Make suggestions.

01:54:34.343 --> 01:54:35.844
[SPEAKER_18]: Zelda, Funky, Homo Sapiens.

01:54:36.045 --> 01:54:38.486
[SPEAKER_16]: See what I can do.

01:54:38.506 --> 01:54:42.149
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you write that on the next Scantron that goes and makes the DDR games?

01:54:42.169 --> 01:54:42.690
[SPEAKER_16]: That'd be great.

01:54:44.291 --> 01:54:44.911
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, my score.

01:54:44.931 --> 01:54:47.613
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess I'd give it a, I don't know, like a 7.5.

01:54:48.514 --> 01:54:49.014
[SPEAKER_16]: It was neato.

01:54:49.375 --> 01:54:51.016
[SPEAKER_16]: Extaper, do you want to give a score on that one?

01:54:51.276 --> 01:54:52.437
[SPEAKER_16]: Zelda, Funky, Homo Sapiens?

01:54:53.604 --> 01:54:54.605
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I would give it a 9.

01:54:56.467 --> 01:54:56.767
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

01:54:56.807 --> 01:54:59.029
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I really enjoyed it.

01:54:59.049 --> 01:54:59.629
[SPEAKER_08]: When you moved?

01:55:00.090 --> 01:55:00.550
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

01:55:00.911 --> 01:55:01.211
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

01:55:01.311 --> 01:55:04.073
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, remember it.

01:55:04.213 --> 01:55:06.455
[SPEAKER_16]: Our scores don't count, but yours do.

01:55:06.576 --> 01:55:09.498
[SPEAKER_16]: It's about time to vote, but first, let's recap your choices.

[SPEAKER_16]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

01:55:56.094 --> 01:56:01.217
[SPEAKER_16]: And we'll announce the winner in a few moments here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:56:01.497 --> 01:56:02.798
[SPEAKER_16]: What are you kids talking about back there?

01:56:03.038 --> 01:56:08.321
[SPEAKER_19]: I was saying that I found a whole bunch of CDs that I hope aren't warped, so I was going to try to burn myself a new car CD.

01:56:08.742 --> 01:56:13.685
[SPEAKER_19]: And that was going to go on it, so instead of being all Eurobeat driving in my Lancer, I'll be all...

01:56:14.525 --> 01:56:15.346
[SPEAKER_19]: Side to side.

01:56:18.047 --> 01:56:18.667
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what?

01:56:18.928 --> 01:56:28.753
[SPEAKER_16]: When I'm listening to that song, if I was driving and listening to this song, I think I would be like... Check and turn a signal to the left.

01:56:28.773 --> 01:56:31.115
[SPEAKER_16]: Check and turn a signal to the right.

01:56:33.696 --> 01:56:35.497
[SPEAKER_16]: Props to you if you get that reference, by the way.

01:56:35.537 --> 01:56:39.120
[SPEAKER_14]: How could you not get that reference?

01:56:39.160 --> 01:56:41.161
[SPEAKER_14]: You're an idiot if you don't get that reference.

01:56:41.281 --> 01:56:43.082
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope that folks in the chatroom get that.

01:56:43.817 --> 01:56:45.578
[SPEAKER_16]: But seriously, that's what it sounds like to me.

01:56:47.099 --> 01:56:52.021
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, when you do that, and you ride in the car, tell me that your mind will not do that.

01:56:52.081 --> 01:56:53.181
[SPEAKER_16]: Do the check, enter.

01:56:53.461 --> 01:56:58.064
[SPEAKER_19]: Now it was... I'm just gonna be all like, I'm gonna be like, shit, yeah, it's dealt.

01:56:58.324 --> 01:56:58.984
[SPEAKER_19]: Woohoo.

01:57:00.184 --> 01:57:00.505
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

01:57:02.386 --> 01:57:08.969
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the part of the show where we usually ask our buddy Loki what's going on in the sim scene, because lord knows I don't follow it.

01:57:09.269 --> 01:57:09.589
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki.

01:57:09.929 --> 01:57:12.150
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I told you earlier what exactly happened.

01:57:12.886 --> 01:57:18.890
[SPEAKER_15]: The main thing that happened this week was that the In The Groove theme is released for Stepmania, and that is it.

01:57:20.390 --> 01:57:22.532
[SPEAKER_16]: No new Max 300 remixes of notes?

01:57:24.152 --> 01:57:24.373
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

01:57:24.853 --> 01:57:25.133
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

01:57:27.647 --> 01:57:37.811
[SPEAKER_16]: One thing I do want to ask you about then, since there's not a lot going on in the sim scene world, this kind of blurs the line here, this isn't necessarily DDR related, but we get to talk about other games when we want to on the show as well.

01:57:38.351 --> 01:57:41.272
[SPEAKER_16]: What is up with the PSP homebrew stuff?

01:57:42.332 --> 01:57:47.794
[SPEAKER_16]: I know it was released this week, how does it work, is it good, tell us about it, put down WarioWare for a minute, tell us about it.

01:57:49.352 --> 01:57:50.552
[SPEAKER_16]: Damn you, hit the pause button!

01:57:51.172 --> 01:57:51.472
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

01:57:51.832 --> 01:57:52.413
[SPEAKER_15]: Ugh, fine.

01:57:52.753 --> 01:58:17.357
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyways, um, no, the whole thing with the homebrew stuff, basically, they found a workaround to get, you know, games to work on version 1.5 PSPs, and for those who don't know, the version 1.0 PSPs were the very first PSPs shipped in Japan, and those had a hole in it, and their encryption or whatever that allowed you to run your own homebrew

01:58:18.230 --> 01:58:19.351
[SPEAKER_15]: Code on PSPs.

01:58:42.978 --> 01:58:43.418
[SPEAKER_15]: and so on.

01:59:02.393 --> 01:59:12.922
[SPEAKER_15]: Now what they have available for is all the mainstream emulators out there so you can emulate Nintendo, the Super Nintendo, Genesis, Mega Drive.

01:59:13.502 --> 01:59:16.465
[SPEAKER_16]: Why is it so easy to port all these emulators over the PSP?

01:59:16.525 --> 01:59:18.967
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it because the PSP is like a mini PC or something?

01:59:18.987 --> 01:59:25.332
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it's just run off of, you basically adapt your code to whatever processor it is.

01:59:25.832 --> 01:59:32.674
[SPEAKER_15]: and I forget what kind it is, but it's basically just like, you know, the difference between the Nintendo DS and the Game Boy Advance.

01:59:32.734 --> 01:59:34.675
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just ARM 9 and ARM 7.

01:59:34.735 --> 01:59:36.996
[SPEAKER_15]: They're really almost the same processor.

01:59:37.376 --> 01:59:38.836
[SPEAKER_15]: So you only have to change your code a little bit.

01:59:38.856 --> 01:59:44.218
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like kind of programming in, say, C versus C++ or Visual C++.

01:59:44.238 --> 01:59:49.220
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a few different ways you program stuff, and so you have to program it differently for that.

01:59:49.753 --> 01:59:51.056
[SPEAKER_15]: and so it's easy to port it over.

01:59:51.236 --> 01:59:56.486
[SPEAKER_16]: Well now obviously this process doesn't take much time because I was looking at the emulators.

01:59:57.127 --> 01:59:57.227
[SPEAKER_16]: Now...

01:59:58.146 --> 01:59:58.426
[SPEAKER_16]: and so on.

02:00:22.742 --> 02:00:33.289
[SPEAKER_15]: I've even seen some, I don't know what exactly it is, like Quake and then Duke Nukem 3D, but I think those are just conversions or mods of Doom or something.

02:00:34.470 --> 02:00:40.313
[SPEAKER_15]: But those are available, and then you see actually people making basic programs like chess and tic-tac-toe and whatnot.

02:00:41.194 --> 02:00:42.655
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are available, and

02:00:43.664 --> 02:00:47.307
[SPEAKER_15]: Pretty much, you know, this is just going to keep going, you know.

02:00:47.627 --> 02:00:56.033
[SPEAKER_15]: And they've found a way, supposedly now, Sony's like, oh yeah, well we're going to try to make you upgrade again so this hole's closed so you can't do this.

02:00:56.654 --> 02:01:00.397
[SPEAKER_15]: But, you know, it's just something fun to do while you're waiting for more games to come out for the PSP.

02:01:01.459 --> 02:01:02.460
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really what it comes down to.

02:01:18.246 --> 02:01:19.547
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a game out there that does that now?

02:01:43.695 --> 02:01:45.896
[SPEAKER_16]: You will not be able to decrypt our encryption.

02:01:45.956 --> 02:01:48.157
[SPEAKER_16]: That is just an invite for hackers to hack it.

02:01:48.537 --> 02:01:52.059
[SPEAKER_16]: So what's to say that 1.5.2 won't be cracked soon enough?

02:01:52.279 --> 02:01:53.239
[SPEAKER_15]: It just might.

02:01:53.459 --> 02:02:02.323
[SPEAKER_15]: Or what they might do is get away to where it doesn't matter what firmware you update it to, it'll bypass the whole encryption thing altogether.

02:02:02.503 --> 02:02:04.044
[SPEAKER_15]: Basically, just a workaround for it.

02:02:05.268 --> 02:02:18.034
[SPEAKER_15]: It's possible because, for example, earlier this week supposedly leaked on the internet was their entire library for all the library files for the PSP development kit.

02:02:18.314 --> 02:02:21.895
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you get a hold of that, you're going to see how everything works.

02:02:21.995 --> 02:02:24.136
[SPEAKER_15]: And it won't matter how many times you upgrade the firmware.

02:02:24.176 --> 02:02:28.558
[SPEAKER_15]: They're just going to have a way around it where it'll think it's like a version whatever.

02:02:28.598 --> 02:02:29.939
[SPEAKER_15]: It'll think it's a UMD or something.

02:02:30.299 --> 02:02:31.320
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll just get away around it.

02:02:31.460 --> 02:02:33.741
[SPEAKER_16]: In my opinion, this kind of sells PSPs.

02:02:33.801 --> 02:02:37.083
[SPEAKER_16]: I kind of want one even more now, knowing I can play Legend of Zelda on it.

02:02:37.383 --> 02:02:47.009
[SPEAKER_15]: They don't understand that, granted, they should just allow it to run homebrew code, but I don't think they want to be responsible for this kind of stuff.

02:02:47.029 --> 02:02:48.950
[SPEAKER_15]: So they have to actively try to

02:02:49.608 --> 02:02:49.908
[SPEAKER_15]: and so on.

02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:14.422
[SPEAKER_16]: But isn't it harder to get something on the DS because the DS doesn't have that whole memory stick thing?

02:03:15.042 --> 02:03:16.623
[SPEAKER_16]: Granted, it has the flash cards.

02:03:16.763 --> 02:03:18.924
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, the flash cards are the way you do that.

02:03:19.364 --> 02:03:24.486
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think what they're doing right now with the PSP, though, is they've got...

02:03:25.979 --> 02:03:35.808
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, some of the things I thought were pretty cool is you can actually overclock your PC in some of these games, because it is running, the chip's supposed to run at 333 MHz, but it actually runs at 222.

02:03:36.128 --> 02:03:43.475
[SPEAKER_15]: So some of these emulators, they actually have it where you can overclock it to 333, so it runs at what it's supposed to.

02:03:44.036 --> 02:03:47.559
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's just interesting to see what you can do with this.

02:03:47.619 --> 02:03:51.663
[SPEAKER_15]: And Beats of Rage is awesome, because it has so many different mods to it, so you can play like

02:03:52.473 --> 02:03:58.477
[SPEAKER_15]: It's basically a final fight, so you can do it with whatever characters you want, like Mega Man or Ghosts and Goblins.

02:03:58.517 --> 02:04:00.218
[SPEAKER_15]: I've seen some really strange mods out there.

02:04:00.599 --> 02:04:02.980
[SPEAKER_15]: Kill Bill, someone's made a mod for that.

02:04:04.121 --> 02:04:05.222
[SPEAKER_15]: So, it's interesting.

02:04:05.822 --> 02:04:06.323
[SPEAKER_16]: Interesting.

02:04:07.183 --> 02:04:18.011
[SPEAKER_16]: All I know is that when I saw Legend of Zelda being played, the first thing, and I know Sigrid thought of this, was that, oh my gosh, we could play Kid Icarus on the PSP, and that makes the PSP just totally worth having.

02:04:18.051 --> 02:04:21.213
[SPEAKER_16]: And I was just thinking about that too, and I was just kind of fantasizing.

02:04:25.304 --> 02:04:26.605
[SPEAKER_16]: Tell me this doesn't make you happy.

02:04:28.046 --> 02:04:28.966
[SPEAKER_16]: Damn you, Nintendo.

02:04:29.447 --> 02:04:31.188
[SPEAKER_16]: Damn you, Nintendo, for not putting out a sequel.

02:04:31.408 --> 02:04:35.751
[SPEAKER_15]: I can tell you pretty much it's going to be in goddamn Animal Crossing DS.

02:04:35.831 --> 02:04:36.471
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to be.

02:04:36.591 --> 02:04:38.612
[SPEAKER_16]: It better be.

02:04:39.193 --> 02:04:39.793
[SPEAKER_16]: It better be.

02:04:39.833 --> 02:04:42.275
[SPEAKER_16]: I want a new Kid Icarus, though, and no 3D crap.

02:04:42.295 --> 02:04:46.998
[SPEAKER_19]: I want like a 2D... I just remember the old... What was that comic...

02:04:47.968 --> 02:04:52.410
[SPEAKER_19]: They don't do it anymore, but it was sort of like 8-bit theater.

02:04:53.711 --> 02:04:56.072
[SPEAKER_19]: But it had Mario and all the guys hanging out at the bar.

02:04:56.872 --> 02:05:00.994
[SPEAKER_19]: No one's talking about their upgrades, and Pip's like, Hey, I want one!

02:05:01.474 --> 02:05:02.795
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry, you don't get one.

02:05:04.164 --> 02:05:10.726
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember Miyamoto saying something at E3 about he wants to put Kid Icarus on The Revolution, like a new one.

02:05:11.846 --> 02:05:13.867
[SPEAKER_16]: He just cock-teased what he is, honestly.

02:05:14.267 --> 02:05:21.949
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll take a tactics game or a first-person shooter with Pit, but so long as I get a Kid Icarus game, that's what matters.

02:05:22.409 --> 02:05:24.450
[SPEAKER_16]: I will not accept any of that crap.

02:05:24.630 --> 02:05:26.911
[SPEAKER_16]: I want a good old 2D...

02:05:28.391 --> 02:05:30.652
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't care if they did a good job with it.

02:05:30.672 --> 02:05:30.932
[SPEAKER_16]: It's fun.

02:05:53.393 --> 02:05:58.814
[SPEAKER_16]: But of course, people would just say that that's because I have this intense hatred for first-person shooters, which, you know, whatever.

02:05:58.834 --> 02:06:00.375
[SPEAKER_14]: Which is why you own Halo 1 and 2.

02:06:00.475 --> 02:06:02.555
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, yes, which is why I own Halo 1 and 2.

02:06:05.196 --> 02:06:05.496
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

02:06:07.736 --> 02:06:10.357
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's find out who won tonight's cage match, shall we?

02:06:11.577 --> 02:06:15.318
[SPEAKER_16]: Tonight's cage match, the winner is... You guys ready for this?

02:06:17.327 --> 02:06:24.730
[SPEAKER_16]: It is a tie tonight, and it's our favorite kind of tie, boys and girls.

02:06:24.870 --> 02:06:27.171
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a three-way tie tonight!

02:06:28.772 --> 02:06:40.357
[SPEAKER_16]: So we gotta go look at the Orange Lounge Radio rulebook, and let's see here... Oh yes, I believe the way a three-way tie works, per the Orange Lounge Radio cage match rules, is that the...

02:06:41.628 --> 02:06:42.688
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for watching!

02:07:04.315 --> 02:07:05.216
[SPEAKER_16]: You gotta break a tie.

02:07:05.937 --> 02:07:06.398
[SPEAKER_16]: What's it gonna be?

02:07:06.438 --> 02:07:11.326
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it gonna be Spray I Kill With My Car or Dell the Funky Homo Sapien with Dr. Bombay?

02:07:11.766 --> 02:07:12.467
[SPEAKER_15]: Dr. Bombay.

02:07:13.048 --> 02:07:13.649
[SPEAKER_16]: Alrighty.

02:07:13.689 --> 02:07:18.056
[SPEAKER_16]: Dell the Funky Homo Sapien with Dr. Bombay in a very, very close vote tonight.

02:07:24.808 --> 02:07:27.089
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, check and turn and settle to the left.

02:07:27.129 --> 02:07:30.989
[SPEAKER_16]: That will be in rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:07:31.009 --> 02:07:40.251
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll come back for a chance at a second week victory, but boys and girls, songs that prevail in three-way ties very rarely last more than one week.

02:07:40.291 --> 02:07:41.052
[SPEAKER_16]: But we shall see.

02:07:41.132 --> 02:07:41.672
[SPEAKER_16]: We shall see.

02:07:42.572 --> 02:07:42.852
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

02:07:43.272 --> 02:07:45.113
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, you don't want your song to win anyway.

02:07:46.953 --> 02:07:48.313
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I like this in the chat room.

02:07:48.373 --> 02:07:49.794
[SPEAKER_16]: Sky's will is absolute.

02:07:49.894 --> 02:07:50.354
[SPEAKER_16]: I like this.

02:07:50.694 --> 02:07:51.674
[SPEAKER_16]: It makes me feel special.

02:07:55.915 --> 02:07:57.216
[SPEAKER_16]: Pardon me while I stroke my ego here.

02:07:57.496 --> 02:08:00.738
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to go to a break, and when we come back from this break, we will be taking... Is that your ego?

02:08:02.519 --> 02:08:03.199
[SPEAKER_16]: You're disgusting.

02:08:05.120 --> 02:08:11.864
[SPEAKER_16]: When we come back from this break, we will take your calls on the Skype line, and of course we will get to the FUs of the week as well.

02:08:11.904 --> 02:08:16.646
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that statement there brings a certain song to mind that needs playing.

02:08:16.706 --> 02:08:18.588
[SPEAKER_16]: So let's get to a little bit of DJ Taka here.

02:08:18.628 --> 02:08:20.949
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio.

02:08:50.533 --> 02:08:51.354
Thanks for watching!

02:09:50.908 --> 02:09:51.689
DarkSakura

02:10:21.556 --> 02:10:22.636
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:17.701
Thanks for watching!

02:14:13.928 --> 02:14:16.349
DarkSakura, DarkSakura DarkSakura

02:16:03.257 --> 02:16:12.615
[SPEAKER_03]: And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:16:13.363 --> 02:16:17.445
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.

02:16:17.465 --> 02:16:18.425
[SPEAKER_16]: Can we talk about that?

02:16:18.705 --> 02:16:21.067
[SPEAKER_07]: No subject will ever be taboo.

02:16:21.347 --> 02:16:24.968
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.

02:16:25.488 --> 02:16:28.050
[SPEAKER_16]: Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.

02:16:28.550 --> 02:16:33.892
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

02:16:34.452 --> 02:16:35.733
[SPEAKER_07]: I collect your fucking head.

02:16:37.685 --> 02:16:39.187
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like this fucker here.

02:16:40.288 --> 02:16:43.971
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?

02:16:44.251 --> 02:16:47.634
[SPEAKER_07]: The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

02:16:48.575 --> 02:16:55.021
[SPEAKER_07]: Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

02:16:56.263 --> 02:16:59.966
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

02:17:03.888 --> 02:17:05.629
[SPEAKER_16]: God damn, we need new promos.

02:17:06.229 --> 02:17:09.210
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to make our listeners do the work for us, honestly, because we're kind of lazy.

02:17:09.230 --> 02:17:10.030
[SPEAKER_19]: I have an idea for one.

02:17:10.350 --> 02:17:10.590
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you?

02:17:10.930 --> 02:17:11.131
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

02:17:11.711 --> 02:17:15.492
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to make a thread in our super secret forum and keep these ideas flowing.

02:17:15.512 --> 02:17:18.753
[SPEAKER_16]: Because sometimes I think of ideas at work and then I forget to write them down and then they're gone forever.

02:17:18.773 --> 02:17:21.374
[SPEAKER_19]: I have to sneak onto the webpage to be able to update at work.

02:17:21.394 --> 02:17:21.774
[SPEAKER_16]: That's right.

02:17:21.794 --> 02:17:23.455
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, you can always send me an email and I'll post it for you.

02:17:23.475 --> 02:17:23.555
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

02:17:23.575 --> 02:17:24.435
[SPEAKER_16]: Because you can do that.

02:17:24.715 --> 02:17:26.496
[SPEAKER_16]: Isn't that weird that you can do email but you can't do internet?

02:17:27.074 --> 02:17:38.244
[SPEAKER_19]: The email that doesn't work half the time, because the thing of the way that the email at my work is, is that there's supposed to be some server to block outside mail, which actually only works half of the time and never works on you.

02:17:40.946 --> 02:17:41.807
[SPEAKER_19]: I always get your email.

02:17:44.349 --> 02:17:48.133
[SPEAKER_19]: And no, none of you in the chat room get my work email, so, sod off.

02:17:50.379 --> 02:17:53.281
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, Skype line is open if you guys want to give us a call.

02:17:53.581 --> 02:17:57.565
[SPEAKER_16]: www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on Interact With Us.

02:17:57.605 --> 02:17:59.667
[SPEAKER_16]: And look at that, it's lighting up already.

02:18:00.348 --> 02:18:02.570
[SPEAKER_16]: I think our listeners are starting to understand that when they don't call in...

02:18:03.424 --> 02:18:04.824
[SPEAKER_16]: that Paris Hilton is going to come up.

02:18:04.884 --> 02:18:06.205
[SPEAKER_16]: So they're getting smart.

02:18:06.245 --> 02:18:07.025
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have a call.

02:18:07.345 --> 02:18:08.525
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:18:09.826 --> 02:18:11.546
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, Sephiroth 1215 here.

02:18:11.946 --> 02:18:13.187
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello, Sephiroth 1215.

02:18:13.607 --> 02:18:16.468
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know you're calling in to talk about that new Paris Hilton Carl's Jr.

02:18:16.488 --> 02:18:17.108
[SPEAKER_16]: commercial, right?

02:18:18.648 --> 02:18:19.828
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, of course.

02:18:19.848 --> 02:18:21.429
[SPEAKER_16]: That's pretty cool.

02:18:21.509 --> 02:18:22.409
[SPEAKER_16]: That's hot, huh?

02:18:23.629 --> 02:18:24.910
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, yeah, it is.

02:18:25.470 --> 02:18:26.770
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, enough BS.

02:18:26.790 --> 02:18:27.270
[SPEAKER_16]: What's on your mind?

02:18:29.811 --> 02:18:31.592
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, just some random stuff, I guess.

02:18:33.528 --> 02:18:39.172
[SPEAKER_01]: Last week I got the In The Groove and Afterburner Pad bundle What'd you think?

02:18:39.252 --> 02:18:58.446
[SPEAKER_16]: Because honestly I haven't picked up In The Groove yet And that has nothing to do with Loki's distaste of the game rubbing off on me or anything It's just that I actually don't have an American PS2 And I don't want to mod my Japanese one because I know I will fuck it up So I am kind of waiting until I can afford an American PS2 So I'm curious, how's the game?

02:19:00.040 --> 02:19:06.245
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay, it's going to hold me over until like September, you know, when Extreme 2 comes out.

02:19:06.926 --> 02:19:14.873
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to mention, with the Afterburner pad, I have to basically go back to all the other games and get new scores on them, so I'm pretty good this summer.

02:19:15.773 --> 02:19:17.054
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you think of the Afterburner pad?

02:19:17.074 --> 02:19:18.536
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the brand new metal pad, right?

02:19:18.596 --> 02:19:19.897
[SPEAKER_16]: So how's that working out for you?

02:19:21.134 --> 02:19:26.117
[SPEAKER_01]: At first, I thought it wasn't worth the money, but once I broke in the arrows, everything was perfectly fine.

02:19:26.397 --> 02:19:27.057
[SPEAKER_01]: It works great.

02:19:28.298 --> 02:19:29.238
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot of fun with it.

02:19:29.578 --> 02:19:31.879
[SPEAKER_01]: How much are your scores improving on the old games?

02:19:34.441 --> 02:19:35.641
[SPEAKER_16]: Pretty much by a whole grade.

02:19:36.522 --> 02:19:36.822
[SPEAKER_16]: Awesome.

02:19:37.435 --> 02:19:37.755
[SPEAKER_16]: Good stuff.

02:19:38.295 --> 02:19:39.936
[SPEAKER_16]: Sigurd, I have a curious question.

02:19:39.976 --> 02:19:46.099
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if you can answer this or what, but when you guys are testing the game at Konami, I know you guys don't actually... We use softpads.

02:19:46.819 --> 02:19:48.600
[SPEAKER_14]: You do play Konami softpads?

02:19:48.760 --> 02:19:50.180
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, you use the official Konami pads.

02:19:50.200 --> 02:19:51.061
[SPEAKER_16]: You don't use the other product.

02:19:51.121 --> 02:19:53.542
[SPEAKER_14]: I was just curious if you ever use the metal stuff.

02:19:53.602 --> 02:19:56.003
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll tell you why after we're off the air.

02:19:56.596 --> 02:20:02.802
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just going to some old stuff now.

02:20:02.822 --> 02:20:06.505
[SPEAKER_16]: I just got Star Ocean since it went to a greatest hits price.

02:20:06.546 --> 02:20:06.686
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

02:20:18.837 --> 02:20:21.299
[SPEAKER_16]: I love that when the games get cheaper because they're greatest hits.

02:20:21.879 --> 02:20:23.200
[SPEAKER_16]: That's usually when I end up buying them.

02:20:25.121 --> 02:20:25.382
[SPEAKER_16]: Awesome.

02:20:25.402 --> 02:20:27.083
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's been happening rapidly.

02:20:27.763 --> 02:20:30.285
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, anything else you wanted to call in tonight, ask us about?

02:20:30.445 --> 02:20:33.627
[SPEAKER_16]: Any questions for us here in studio or Sigurd, our guest, or whatever?

02:20:35.769 --> 02:20:36.249
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really.

02:20:37.110 --> 02:20:37.850
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'm good now.

02:20:38.130 --> 02:20:39.071
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, sounds good.

02:20:39.111 --> 02:20:40.132
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, thank you for calling in.

02:20:41.473 --> 02:20:41.873
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.

02:20:41.993 --> 02:20:42.674
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, anytime.

02:20:42.734 --> 02:20:43.134
[SPEAKER_16]: Have a good one.

02:20:43.936 --> 02:20:44.237
[SPEAKER_01]: You too.

02:20:44.337 --> 02:20:44.677
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye.

02:20:46.080 --> 02:20:46.420
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

02:20:47.803 --> 02:20:48.764
[SPEAKER_16]: Sky Flying is open again.

02:20:48.804 --> 02:20:51.889
[SPEAKER_16]: If you want to give us a call, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

02:20:51.929 --> 02:20:58.100
[SPEAKER_16]: Click on Interact With Us, and that has all the details you need in order to connect with us.

02:20:59.028 --> 02:21:01.610
[SPEAKER_16]: While we're waiting for another call, if we get one, I don't know.

02:21:01.791 --> 02:21:03.432
[SPEAKER_16]: Like I said, our listeners are down.

02:21:03.452 --> 02:21:07.796
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if it's just college or they're studying for finals or graduating or whatever's going on in your neck of the woods.

02:21:09.097 --> 02:21:13.000
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to mention real quick that we actually have a live journal system set up.

02:21:13.040 --> 02:21:15.883
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, you guys know about our live journal community at Orange Lounge.

02:21:15.903 --> 02:21:18.385
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I didn't know about this until tonight.

02:21:18.825 --> 02:21:26.692
[SPEAKER_16]: One of our listeners, Arcadian42, is also a frequent guest of the show, actually created an Orange Lounge radio program.

02:21:27.700 --> 02:21:29.241
[SPEAKER_16]: OLR underscore podcast

02:21:56.599 --> 02:22:05.484
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you want to be able to find the whole link there, it's just www.livejournal.com slash users slash OLR underscore podcast.

02:22:05.504 --> 02:22:11.307
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you add that username to your friends list over on LiveJournal, then you will know when new podcasts are posted.

02:22:11.327 --> 02:22:16.510
[SPEAKER_16]: You also get the brief little description about what we talk about on each one, our little synopsis.

02:22:17.510 --> 02:22:18.090
[SPEAKER_16]: So check that out.

02:22:18.170 --> 02:22:20.031
[SPEAKER_16]: And also don't forget to plug us over on podcast.

02:22:21.403 --> 02:22:25.566
[SPEAKER_16]: Vote for us over on PodcastAlley.com because we appreciate your vote.

02:22:25.886 --> 02:22:29.829
[SPEAKER_16]: And there's also another We Need Your Help type thing I will talk about a little later.

02:22:30.109 --> 02:22:33.751
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to bring that up in a few minutes here after we get through some other stuff.

02:22:36.413 --> 02:22:41.777
[SPEAKER_16]: I do not see any other calls coming in, so I guess that's it.

02:22:42.517 --> 02:22:45.920
[SPEAKER_16]: There's quite a few people online, so I'm kind of surprised that nobody else wants to call, but that's fine.

02:22:46.520 --> 02:22:47.882
[SPEAKER_16]: A question from our chat room, though.

02:22:47.902 --> 02:22:49.363
[SPEAKER_16]: I think this one's more for DarkSakura.

02:22:50.084 --> 02:22:52.126
[SPEAKER_16]: When does the podcast Poop Shoot go live?

02:22:53.488 --> 02:22:54.048
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what?

02:22:55.069 --> 02:22:55.850
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been busy.

02:22:56.611 --> 02:22:57.812
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you turn on my microphone?

02:22:57.872 --> 02:22:58.333
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, you're on.

02:22:58.720 --> 02:22:59.781
[SPEAKER_19]: You turned up my microphone, though.

02:22:59.981 --> 02:23:00.461
[SPEAKER_19]: No, it's not up.

02:23:00.501 --> 02:23:00.981
[SPEAKER_19]: It's too loud.

02:23:02.002 --> 02:23:03.203
[SPEAKER_16]: I turned up the in-house speakers.

02:23:03.263 --> 02:23:04.123
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, turn this up, please.

02:23:04.383 --> 02:23:05.144
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry.

02:23:07.145 --> 02:23:10.087
[SPEAKER_19]: Hearing the reverb gives me instant headaches.

02:23:10.107 --> 02:23:13.148
[SPEAKER_16]: I have to turn it up to hear the calls on Skype.

02:23:13.269 --> 02:23:21.333
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, at any rate, if you come over to my house and pack up all my crap and move it to my new house, then maybe I'll make it.

02:23:22.694 --> 02:23:22.854
[SPEAKER_19]: So...

02:23:24.776 --> 02:23:26.657
[SPEAKER_19]: or pay for the domain for me, I don't know.

02:23:27.457 --> 02:23:32.739
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm still looking for someone to take the domain I registered and never used for Death Cake.

02:23:34.040 --> 02:23:36.101
[SPEAKER_19]: And you could make a pornography site out of it if you want.

02:23:36.361 --> 02:23:36.961
[SPEAKER_19]: No, that's okay.

02:23:37.021 --> 02:23:40.363
[SPEAKER_19]: I actually registered lastlivingsouls.com.

02:23:41.943 --> 02:23:44.905
[SPEAKER_16]: So anyways... Our chat room is saying they're all shy.

02:23:44.945 --> 02:23:46.406
[SPEAKER_16]: They don't want to call in and be on air tonight.

02:23:46.466 --> 02:23:46.906
[SPEAKER_16]: Fine.

02:23:47.726 --> 02:23:49.107
[SPEAKER_16]: At least we got the one guy.

02:23:49.227 --> 02:23:54.090
[SPEAKER_19]: If you don't call in, I will come over to your house and personally kick your butt until you call in.

02:23:54.390 --> 02:23:55.431
[SPEAKER_19]: We did get one person.

02:23:55.671 --> 02:23:56.712
[SPEAKER_19]: No, no, no, no, no, no.

02:23:56.732 --> 02:23:58.933
[SPEAKER_15]: Well anyways, the thing I was working on before...

02:23:59.383 --> 02:24:14.272
[SPEAKER_15]: See, before when I was playing around with this program called RPG Maker 2003, the thing that I didn't like about it the most was having to draw all the sprite graphics and stuff, and that really kind of frustrated me because I had really good ideas, but I didn't want to have to draw everything because that takes way too much time.

02:24:14.352 --> 02:24:15.072
[SPEAKER_15]: I hate drawing, too.

02:24:15.352 --> 02:24:16.313
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just not good at it.

02:24:16.393 --> 02:24:20.935
[SPEAKER_15]: Especially since plotting out an RPG is way too much work as it is.

02:24:23.340 --> 02:24:29.923
[SPEAKER_15]: I figured I'd go ahead and play around the program some more because the mods for Beats of Rage actually have sprites in them.

02:24:30.344 --> 02:24:31.084
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's kind of nice.

02:24:31.244 --> 02:24:33.365
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm stealing those because I'm lazy.

02:24:33.905 --> 02:24:37.487
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I am making an RPG.

02:24:37.667 --> 02:24:38.147
[SPEAKER_15]: It'll be fun.

02:24:39.248 --> 02:24:40.168
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh wait, is that your new project?

02:24:40.369 --> 02:24:41.049
[SPEAKER_15]: That's my new project.

02:24:41.069 --> 02:24:41.709
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

02:24:41.949 --> 02:24:43.390
[SPEAKER_15]: But, the best part.

02:24:43.990 --> 02:24:44.491
[SPEAKER_15]: We're in it.

02:24:45.251 --> 02:24:45.891
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh great.

02:24:46.291 --> 02:24:51.054
[SPEAKER_16]: Wait, did you just... As the collective groan arises from the studio...

02:24:52.335 --> 02:24:54.137
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, you look frightened by that.

02:24:54.237 --> 02:24:55.038
[SPEAKER_19]: I can draw, you know.

02:24:56.079 --> 02:24:59.963
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I know, but I don't need you guys to draw anything.

02:25:00.223 --> 02:25:02.246
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, oh, you don't need us.

02:25:02.506 --> 02:25:03.567
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't need our help.

02:25:03.927 --> 02:25:04.288
[SPEAKER_15]: Fine.

02:25:04.768 --> 02:25:06.650
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope your project sucks.

02:25:07.891 --> 02:25:12.396
[SPEAKER_15]: I figured out who the villain's going to be, though, but I can't say because it's going to be funny.

02:25:12.657 --> 02:25:12.997
[SPEAKER_15]: Trust me.

02:25:13.248 --> 02:25:15.190
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I know who you would make the villain.

02:25:15.210 --> 02:25:16.951
[SPEAKER_16]: You'd make the villain, like, Roxor or something.

02:25:16.971 --> 02:25:17.732
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, we got a call.

02:25:18.032 --> 02:25:18.273
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

02:25:18.453 --> 02:25:19.414
[SPEAKER_15]: Bigger than Roxor.

02:25:19.714 --> 02:25:20.134
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, boy.

02:25:20.214 --> 02:25:20.555
[SPEAKER_16]: Here we go.

02:25:20.575 --> 02:25:21.255
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, we got a call.

02:25:21.496 --> 02:25:22.857
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:25:26.081 --> 02:25:27.482
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

02:25:27.502 --> 02:25:27.963
[SPEAKER_16]: That's it.

02:25:28.023 --> 02:25:29.604
[SPEAKER_19]: I go back to spamming the chat room.

02:25:29.624 --> 02:25:31.746
[SPEAKER_16]: Now you're not on Orange Launch Radio.

02:25:33.708 --> 02:25:35.189
[SPEAKER_15]: So anyways, as I was talking about the game.

02:25:35.409 --> 02:25:36.550
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, F you too.

02:25:36.750 --> 02:25:37.551
[SPEAKER_16]: I see how it is.

02:25:37.851 --> 02:25:44.798
[SPEAKER_15]: Think Kingdom Hearts minus the Disney characters and all the console characters.

02:25:45.078 --> 02:25:46.299
[SPEAKER_15]: Like a lot of console characters.

02:25:47.188 --> 02:25:49.209
[SPEAKER_15]: and just have random villains in it.

02:25:49.509 --> 02:25:53.872
[SPEAKER_15]: But there's one big villain that's in charge of everything and he's the worst video game villain.

02:25:53.892 --> 02:25:55.153
[SPEAKER_17]: It's Mr. Spanky, isn't it?

02:25:55.173 --> 02:25:56.394
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it's not Mr. Spanky.

02:25:56.994 --> 02:25:57.274
[SPEAKER_15]: Bigger.

02:25:58.015 --> 02:25:58.595
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I think bigger.

02:26:00.478 --> 02:26:01.018
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

02:26:01.379 --> 02:26:02.159
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't give it away.

02:26:02.219 --> 02:26:05.021
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not going to give any hints only because it's hilarious.

02:26:05.381 --> 02:26:14.747
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've got another person making a cameo in this who's related to our show but not... I can't say.

02:26:15.147 --> 02:26:16.167
[SPEAKER_15]: It'll be funny.

02:26:16.207 --> 02:26:16.648
[SPEAKER_15]: Trust me.

02:26:16.768 --> 02:26:17.188
[SPEAKER_15]: It's great.

02:26:17.568 --> 02:26:24.412
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to work on it but I can't say too much more about it because I don't know if I'll ever finish it or get the urge to actually work on it.

02:26:25.233 --> 02:26:28.355
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'm hopefully going to have it done within like a year.

02:26:29.995 --> 02:26:30.515
[SPEAKER_15]: A year?

02:26:31.376 --> 02:26:35.416
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, I'm giving- Quit your job and do this full time, this is more important.

02:26:36.457 --> 02:26:38.457
[SPEAKER_16]: It'll be cool when it's done, okay?

02:26:38.477 --> 02:26:42.698
[SPEAKER_19]: The walking around, like, overworld music needs to be, like, the Goonies song.

02:26:42.718 --> 02:26:47.639
[SPEAKER_15]: We're gonna have- There's gonna be evil characters in, like, I've already- I've already decided there's gonna be evil Ken.

02:26:48.059 --> 02:26:49.840
[SPEAKER_15]: He's gonna be one of the characters you have to fight in it.

02:26:49.920 --> 02:26:50.740
[SPEAKER_15]: How about evil Rob?

02:26:50.760 --> 02:26:52.240
[SPEAKER_15]: There's gonna be emo Dan.

02:26:53.240 --> 02:26:54.641
[SPEAKER_15]: Like- Dan from Street Fighter?

02:26:54.881 --> 02:26:55.701
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I thought maybe- No.

02:26:55.981 --> 02:26:56.221
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh yeah!

02:26:58.541 --> 02:27:01.262
[SPEAKER_15]: Because he's kind of depressed as it is, so I thought that would be funny.

02:27:01.362 --> 02:27:04.084
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd like to see emo Dan who manages the GameStop.

02:27:04.824 --> 02:27:05.765
[SPEAKER_16]: That would be a fun character.

02:27:05.785 --> 02:27:06.925
[SPEAKER_15]: I can make that character Dan.

02:27:06.945 --> 02:27:09.606
[SPEAKER_16]: That's angry Dan who manages the GameStop.

02:27:09.666 --> 02:27:11.787
[SPEAKER_16]: I know, that's why it's funny to be emo Dan.

02:27:11.867 --> 02:27:16.350
[SPEAKER_15]: It'll be funny, it'll have references from stuff, it'll have inside jokes, it'll be great.

02:27:17.030 --> 02:27:20.892
[SPEAKER_15]: And it'll just have, like, you know, fun stuff, you know.

02:27:21.932 --> 02:27:22.252
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

02:27:22.353 --> 02:27:27.355
[SPEAKER_15]: Like DarkSakura will summon an attack that will involve the gorillas, you know.

02:27:28.840 --> 02:27:30.241
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, the jeep comes running out.

02:27:30.261 --> 02:27:32.461
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I'll run over whoever.

02:27:33.102 --> 02:27:34.022
[SPEAKER_16]: Your mic going crazy.

02:27:34.042 --> 02:27:35.342
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I know.

02:27:35.382 --> 02:27:36.143
[SPEAKER_16]: What's up with that?

02:27:36.583 --> 02:27:36.883
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

02:27:38.344 --> 02:27:38.724
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

02:27:39.124 --> 02:27:40.745
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie, don't bother berating the chat room.

02:27:40.765 --> 02:27:41.925
[SPEAKER_16]: We've got other things to get to.

02:27:41.985 --> 02:27:45.306
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll just... They can be shy if they want.

02:27:45.386 --> 02:27:48.808
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, I think the person who tried to call in was saying that their settings were screwed up.

02:27:48.828 --> 02:27:52.369
[SPEAKER_16]: But we'll open it up again after this.

02:27:52.589 --> 02:27:52.749
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

02:27:52.789 --> 02:27:53.289
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you okay?

02:27:53.409 --> 02:27:55.070
[SPEAKER_16]: I can only breathe through one nostril.

02:27:55.689 --> 02:27:56.189
[SPEAKER_16]: It sucks.

02:27:56.389 --> 02:27:56.970
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry to hear that.

02:27:57.250 --> 02:27:59.491
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, it sounds like you're ready to do some venting, aren't you?

02:28:01.792 --> 02:28:04.173
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think we need to get to the FUs of the week, don't we?

02:28:07.114 --> 02:28:11.056
[SPEAKER_16]: So, DarkSakura, why is it that we do the FUs of the week every single freaking week?

02:28:11.276 --> 02:28:12.417
[SPEAKER_16]: Grr, argh.

02:28:23.639 --> 02:28:25.879
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, I love my FU music now.

02:28:25.959 --> 02:28:28.220
[SPEAKER_19]: It's Angel's Thanatos from Silent Hill 2.

02:28:29.061 --> 02:28:29.661
[SPEAKER_19]: Like, awesome.

02:28:30.941 --> 02:28:34.783
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, uh, my first FU goes to dust.

02:28:36.003 --> 02:28:39.504
[SPEAKER_19]: Goes to throwing away shit I wanted to keep, except I'm too pack-ratty.

02:28:40.545 --> 02:28:42.105
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, FU to dust again.

02:28:42.705 --> 02:28:45.306
[SPEAKER_19]: FU to my nostril being plugged on one side.

02:28:45.326 --> 02:28:49.848
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, FU to food.

02:28:52.069 --> 02:28:53.811
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, F you to the pizza that I ate yesterday.

02:28:53.831 --> 02:28:57.154
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, crap.

02:28:57.634 --> 02:29:00.596
[SPEAKER_19]: F you to the 50 boxes sitting in my living room.

02:29:01.137 --> 02:29:04.019
[SPEAKER_19]: And the fact that my cat is afraid of everything now.

02:29:04.920 --> 02:29:08.223
[SPEAKER_19]: She's been living in her litter box since we started moving all those boxes downstairs.

02:29:08.643 --> 02:29:10.825
[SPEAKER_19]: And why the fuck do I have so much stuff?

02:29:11.626 --> 02:29:16.030
[SPEAKER_19]: I swear, I trip it over controllers and video game systems and the cat.

02:29:16.990 --> 02:29:18.711
[SPEAKER_19]: and, like, RC cars.

02:29:18.811 --> 02:29:20.372
[SPEAKER_19]: We found our initial DRC cars.

02:29:20.413 --> 02:29:21.994
[SPEAKER_16]: You didn't pack Shermie, did you?

02:29:22.374 --> 02:29:22.874
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

02:29:23.374 --> 02:29:26.116
[SPEAKER_19]: Shermie will pack herself in her litter box until we're moved.

02:29:26.556 --> 02:29:33.221
[SPEAKER_19]: Then, at the point that we are at the new location, she will proceed to live in her litter box for a week, like she did the last two times.

02:29:35.049 --> 02:29:37.009
[SPEAKER_19]: Jeremy has been with us through one move already.

02:29:37.690 --> 02:29:38.610
[SPEAKER_19]: She knows things.

02:29:39.110 --> 02:29:42.431
[SPEAKER_19]: She knows this is a strange place that dogs used to live at.

02:29:43.111 --> 02:29:51.213
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh yeah, I'm probably going to have to endure a couple weeks worth of allergies from chows and cigarette smoke that used to reside in the house.

02:29:53.193 --> 02:29:54.353
[SPEAKER_15]: They had smoking dogs.

02:29:54.693 --> 02:29:55.693
[SPEAKER_19]: No, but he smoked.

02:29:55.733 --> 02:29:57.774
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I know he stopped smoking once the baby was born.

02:29:59.249 --> 02:30:02.251
[SPEAKER_19]: Baby Killers Or do you have the ones that actually do smoke themselves?

02:30:21.721 --> 02:30:23.121
[SPEAKER_19]: Britney was smoking while she was pregnant.

02:30:23.762 --> 02:30:24.922
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, she didn't know she was pregnant, right?

02:30:25.322 --> 02:30:26.762
[SPEAKER_19]: No, she was pregnant.

02:30:26.822 --> 02:30:27.623
[SPEAKER_19]: What a dumbass.

02:30:28.023 --> 02:30:29.263
[SPEAKER_19]: It's because she's a stupid bitch.

02:30:29.363 --> 02:30:29.783
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry.

02:30:30.203 --> 02:30:33.504
[SPEAKER_15]: She can't have a smart baby because how else will they grow up to be a pop singer?

02:30:34.805 --> 02:30:35.105
[SPEAKER_16]: True.

02:30:35.245 --> 02:30:36.425
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry to derail that.

02:30:36.465 --> 02:30:36.825
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry.

02:30:40.046 --> 02:30:41.987
[SPEAKER_16]: Back to you and your thoughts.

02:30:42.207 --> 02:30:42.947
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm done.

02:30:43.807 --> 02:30:44.707
[SPEAKER_19]: Fuck you, baby killer!

02:30:45.207 --> 02:30:46.268
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, let's go to Loki.

02:30:49.793 --> 02:30:51.635
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck you to my stomach for being empty.

02:30:52.015 --> 02:30:53.797
[SPEAKER_15]: I want food, and I don't have food.

02:30:54.177 --> 02:30:57.540
[SPEAKER_15]: So I gotta, you know, find food at home, which I'm sure we don't have food there yet.

02:30:57.660 --> 02:30:59.362
[SPEAKER_16]: I have some dam in the kitchen.

02:30:59.642 --> 02:31:00.543
[SPEAKER_16]: I want a dam.

02:31:02.605 --> 02:31:06.108
[SPEAKER_16]: Dam, by the way, is D apostrophe A-I-M, and it's little miniature heat parts.

02:31:06.128 --> 02:31:09.070
[SPEAKER_16]: It's delicious, I gotta know that cue.

02:31:09.471 --> 02:31:11.232
[SPEAKER_15]: Another reason why I wouldn't want that.

02:31:11.352 --> 02:31:11.973
[SPEAKER_15]: No, but, um...

02:31:13.442 --> 02:31:16.584
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck you, the stupid people, especially driving on the road.

02:31:17.445 --> 02:31:20.047
[SPEAKER_15]: I swear to God, people don't use their turn signal or anything.

02:31:20.087 --> 02:31:22.008
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, why do we even add them to the cars?

02:31:22.748 --> 02:31:23.569
[SPEAKER_15]: You're not going to use them.

02:31:24.249 --> 02:31:26.471
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever, but... Fuck you, that.

02:31:26.831 --> 02:31:37.158
[SPEAKER_15]: And to the goddamn onions I had on my burger at lunch, because I still smell them on me after I've brushed my teeth a few times and washed my hands repeatedly.

02:31:37.418 --> 02:31:39.280
[SPEAKER_15]: They still smell like onion.

02:31:40.621 --> 02:31:42.442
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like that's just toxic or something, and I...

02:31:43.004 --> 02:31:43.685
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know what to do.

02:31:44.986 --> 02:31:46.427
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's about it.

02:31:46.987 --> 02:31:47.988
My turn.

02:31:54.830 --> 02:32:04.832
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to give an F you to Nintendo for fucking being a bunch of dicks in WarioWare Twisted and putting in that Kid Icarus record and saying, Ha ha, this is the closest thing you're going to get to a sequel.

02:32:05.112 --> 02:32:09.133
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, ha ha, I hate you and I'm not going to buy any of your crappy products ever again.

02:32:09.453 --> 02:32:11.314
[SPEAKER_16]: Except Nintendogs because Nintendogs is really cute.

02:32:11.394 --> 02:32:12.594
[SPEAKER_16]: And I kind of want Meteos too.

02:32:13.554 --> 02:32:14.335
[SPEAKER_16]: But you suck.

02:32:14.375 --> 02:32:14.995
[SPEAKER_16]: You still suck.

02:32:15.035 --> 02:32:15.795
[SPEAKER_16]: I hate you, Nintendo.

02:32:17.355 --> 02:32:20.816
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, we're all going to have Nintendogs and our puppies are all going to play with each other.

02:32:20.836 --> 02:32:21.896
[SPEAKER_16]: F you to trendiness.

02:32:22.256 --> 02:32:24.017
[SPEAKER_16]: F you to all you being trendy.

02:32:26.030 --> 02:32:28.172
[SPEAKER_16]: I was the first at being trendy.

02:32:28.292 --> 02:32:34.396
[SPEAKER_16]: You all are... DarkSakura is giving me the don't go there hand.

02:32:35.377 --> 02:32:37.278
[SPEAKER_16]: F you to the don't go there hand.

02:32:37.839 --> 02:32:43.703
[SPEAKER_16]: F you to me being lazy because I need to get to the gym and work out because I need a nice body and not a fat one.

02:32:43.843 --> 02:32:45.184
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's it.

02:32:46.345 --> 02:32:48.466
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's go to Sigurd.

02:32:48.506 --> 02:32:49.487
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you have any F yous of the week?

02:32:51.300 --> 02:32:52.921
[SPEAKER_14]: I love that song.

02:32:53.221 --> 02:32:56.562
[SPEAKER_14]: I have no FUs this week.

02:32:57.242 --> 02:32:57.862
[SPEAKER_14]: You have nothing?

02:32:58.103 --> 02:33:01.404
[SPEAKER_14]: I have like a work-related thing I can't do over the air, but that's it.

02:33:01.704 --> 02:33:02.984
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm pretty happy.

02:33:03.064 --> 02:33:06.305
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just do the FU to general work angst.

02:33:06.445 --> 02:33:06.906
[SPEAKER_14]: That's alright.

02:33:07.126 --> 02:33:08.606
[SPEAKER_14]: FU to trance music.

02:33:08.806 --> 02:33:09.386
[SPEAKER_14]: There we go.

02:33:09.486 --> 02:33:11.947
[SPEAKER_14]: Generic, boring trance music.

02:33:12.808 --> 02:33:13.608
[SPEAKER_14]: Big FU to that.

02:33:13.808 --> 02:33:14.068
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

02:33:14.088 --> 02:33:14.368
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

02:33:14.588 --> 02:33:15.028
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds good.

02:33:15.669 --> 02:33:17.429
[SPEAKER_14]: Extafur, do you have any FUs you want to give?

02:33:18.970 --> 02:33:19.430
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't lurk.

02:33:20.405 --> 02:33:24.549
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, fuck you to 300 pound chicks at Walmart.

02:33:25.730 --> 02:33:26.090
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

02:33:26.731 --> 02:33:27.071
[SPEAKER_13]: The end.

02:33:29.233 --> 02:33:30.774
[SPEAKER_16]: How about F you to moomoos in general?

02:33:30.794 --> 02:33:31.715
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't like moomoos.

02:33:32.055 --> 02:33:34.518
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, let's go to the chat room and see what they have to say.

02:33:36.499 --> 02:33:39.702
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, Chimera says, F you to crayons.

02:33:39.862 --> 02:33:40.163
[SPEAKER_16]: Why?

02:33:40.443 --> 02:33:40.843
[SPEAKER_16]: Why not?

02:33:41.864 --> 02:33:43.466
[SPEAKER_16]: I happen to like crayons, personally.

02:33:44.326 --> 02:33:45.868
[SPEAKER_16]: This tastes like purple!

02:33:47.441 --> 02:33:49.964
[SPEAKER_16]: Dark Knight says, My FU goes to this weekend.

02:33:49.984 --> 02:33:51.025
[SPEAKER_16]: Be short.

02:33:51.045 --> 02:33:52.086
[SPEAKER_16]: I so didn't want it to end.

02:33:52.106 --> 02:33:53.787
[SPEAKER_16]: Misty says, My first FU is to cage match.

02:34:06.348 --> 02:34:08.931
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for recognizing what Live Journal is for.

02:34:22.367 --> 02:34:28.448
[SPEAKER_16]: StupidBaka says, nephew to some random guy that almost hit me on Friday while I was walking to City College for class.

02:34:28.869 --> 02:34:32.169
[SPEAKER_16]: He almost hit me and even dared to yell, get out of the way, you fucking punk.

02:34:32.609 --> 02:34:39.111
[SPEAKER_16]: So, of course, I got out of the way, and when he drives like half a block and stops to look back at me saying, watch for cars, dumbass.

02:34:39.491 --> 02:34:44.712
[SPEAKER_16]: So, of course, I flip him the bird and yell at him to watch his shit, because I scratched his car in a lightning bolt.

02:34:47.355 --> 02:34:49.036
[SPEAKER_16]: I stretched this car in a lightning bolt.

02:34:49.397 --> 02:34:50.097
[SPEAKER_16]: That doesn't make sense.

02:34:50.698 --> 02:34:51.878
[SPEAKER_16]: So yeah, fuck you to drivers.

02:34:53.960 --> 02:34:56.202
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkTetsuya says, F you to myself.

02:34:56.342 --> 02:34:58.443
[SPEAKER_16]: I fried my PlayStation by dropping it.

02:34:58.864 --> 02:34:59.244
[SPEAKER_16]: Whoops.

02:35:01.366 --> 02:35:06.950
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I fried my GameCube because I was trying to play WarioWare Twisted in the Game Boy Player and it just, it wasn't working.

02:35:08.331 --> 02:35:12.274
[SPEAKER_16]: Doops says, F you to Orlando being so damn far from where I live.

02:35:12.634 --> 02:35:15.817
[SPEAKER_16]: And F you to DrawnTogether for making Gay Link funny.

02:35:17.985 --> 02:35:19.106
[SPEAKER_16]: Short FU list today.

02:35:19.366 --> 02:35:20.566
[SPEAKER_14]: Because Xander was Gay Link.

02:35:22.227 --> 02:35:26.269
[SPEAKER_14]: Didn't that show come on like eight months ago and hasn't done anything since?

02:35:26.649 --> 02:35:27.549
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, pretty much.

02:35:27.709 --> 02:35:29.430
[SPEAKER_16]: Some people are just a little slow, it's alright.

02:35:30.070 --> 02:35:32.011
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe the DVDs just came out or something, I don't know.

02:35:32.471 --> 02:35:33.151
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe, I don't know.

02:35:33.371 --> 02:35:34.252
[SPEAKER_16]: I would get on that.

02:35:34.852 --> 02:35:36.133
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

02:35:36.153 --> 02:35:37.313
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently not, so.

02:35:38.934 --> 02:35:41.135
[SPEAKER_16]: I totally would buy Drawn Together DVDs, that's awesome.

02:35:41.155 --> 02:35:41.975
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

02:35:41.995 --> 02:35:42.215
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

02:35:45.222 --> 02:35:45.642
[SPEAKER_16]: PodcastAwards.com

02:36:12.118 --> 02:36:14.679
[SPEAKER_16]: We're trying to get ourselves nominated.

02:36:14.900 --> 02:36:21.103
[SPEAKER_16]: Originally, I wasn't going to push for this one because there was just a general technology category.

02:36:21.803 --> 02:36:27.786
[SPEAKER_16]: There's no point because Leo Laporte and This Week in Tech would just whoop everybody's ass, so there's really no point.

02:36:27.826 --> 02:36:29.127
[SPEAKER_16]: We were just not even going to try.

02:36:29.187 --> 02:36:37.371
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, in going to podcastawards.com, we find that they have added a new category for Best Gaming Podcast.

02:36:40.102 --> 02:36:41.403
[SPEAKER_18]: I cast a spell!

02:36:41.643 --> 02:36:47.087
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, vote your conscience, but remember that we like people who help us out.

02:36:47.147 --> 02:36:50.449
[SPEAKER_16]: So, go to podcasting, is it podcasting?

02:36:50.529 --> 02:36:55.593
[SPEAKER_16]: No, podcastawards.com, all one word, and click on the big nominate now.

02:36:55.733 --> 02:36:59.035
[SPEAKER_16]: By the way, it's the very last category listed on the page, way in the bottom right.

02:36:59.455 --> 02:36:59.855
[SPEAKER_16]: Gaming.

02:37:00.356 --> 02:37:04.839
[SPEAKER_16]: And just fill that in, you just put your email address, orangeloungeradio2go.com

02:37:05.559 --> 02:37:08.860
[SPEAKER_16]: and our website and the XML and any other comments you want.

02:37:09.160 --> 02:37:12.461
[SPEAKER_16]: If you don't know the XML, I will post that information in the chat room in a little bit.

02:37:12.501 --> 02:37:16.821
[SPEAKER_16]: So we appreciate all your help because we like getting stuff.

02:37:17.042 --> 02:37:17.442
[SPEAKER_16]: It's cool.

02:37:18.462 --> 02:37:19.022
[SPEAKER_16]: Like awards.

02:37:19.702 --> 02:37:21.162
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm doing it right now.

02:37:21.222 --> 02:37:25.703
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm hoping that the podcast awards are actually filled with chocolate or something because that would be cool.

02:37:28.004 --> 02:37:31.425
[SPEAKER_16]: Like if the podcasting awards were actually made out of solid milk chocolate or something.

02:37:31.885 --> 02:37:32.405
[SPEAKER_16]: I could eat it.

02:37:32.585 --> 02:37:33.185
[SPEAKER_16]: That would be yummy.

02:37:33.979 --> 02:37:34.860
[SPEAKER_16]: or MadeOutOfDamn.

02:37:35.440 --> 02:37:35.981
[SPEAKER_16]: That would be great.

02:37:37.602 --> 02:37:37.982
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

02:37:38.323 --> 02:37:39.383
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to go to another break.

02:37:39.443 --> 02:37:42.986
[SPEAKER_16]: When we come back from this break, we're going to do some Ask Orange Lounge.

02:37:43.587 --> 02:37:44.127
[SPEAKER_16]: That's right.

02:37:44.227 --> 02:37:47.410
[SPEAKER_16]: Send in your questions over private message to Sky in the chat room.

02:37:47.830 --> 02:37:53.675
[SPEAKER_16]: It's your chance to take over the show and ask us any questions that you want.

02:37:54.416 --> 02:37:54.696
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

02:37:55.336 --> 02:37:56.918
[SPEAKER_16]: So we will be back.

02:37:58.012 --> 02:38:01.155
[SPEAKER_16]: After this break, and in this break, I think we need to hear some Parapara.

02:38:01.455 --> 02:38:04.198
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I'm feeling a little sluggish here, and I want to wake up.

02:38:04.979 --> 02:38:06.280
[SPEAKER_16]: I need to wake up a little bit here.

02:38:06.400 --> 02:38:10.604
[SPEAKER_16]: So we'll start it off with Jamie's request here, and we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio.

02:38:10.624 --> 02:38:14.268
[SPEAKER_16]: For those of you guys in chat, I will post more information on how to vote for us on Podcast Awards.

02:38:14.588 --> 02:38:15.429
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll be back after this.

02:39:47.655 --> 02:39:48.605
Thanks for watching!

02:40:31.753 --> 02:40:32.895
Thank you for watching!

02:41:10.779 --> 02:41:11.823
and many more.

02:42:10.396 --> 02:42:11.277
Thank you for watching!

02:43:27.182 --> 02:43:28.506
Thank you for watching!

02:44:27.017 --> 02:44:31.180
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

02:44:31.400 --> 02:44:33.121
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we want to be accepted by Hollywood?

02:44:33.162 --> 02:44:35.823
[SPEAKER_08]: No!

02:44:35.923 --> 02:44:37.284
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we care what people think of us?

02:44:37.925 --> 02:44:39.746
[SPEAKER_08]: No!

02:44:39.786 --> 02:44:41.227
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we want people to kiss our ass?

02:44:41.708 --> 02:44:44.630
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes!

02:44:45.791 --> 02:44:50.574
[SPEAKER_03]: Extreme Bomani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:44:52.025 --> 02:44:54.047
[SPEAKER_16]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:44:54.127 --> 02:44:59.151
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, I found more information on that thing you brought up earlier about in the groove and the whole crash thing.

02:44:59.231 --> 02:45:02.253
[SPEAKER_16]: It's actually in a story that was posted over on DDRFreak.com.

02:45:02.894 --> 02:45:09.079
[SPEAKER_16]: It talks about the game will crash on autoload, basically corrupting a player's saved game.

02:45:09.419 --> 02:45:18.046
[SPEAKER_16]: All you have to do, if the top grade sorting order is selected as the default sort order, then the game crashes.

02:45:19.025 --> 02:45:19.966
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's how to do it.

02:45:19.986 --> 02:45:21.387
[SPEAKER_16]: If you want to crash your game.

02:45:22.268 --> 02:45:23.489
[SPEAKER_16]: So, just thought I'd share that with you.

02:45:24.070 --> 02:45:27.052
[SPEAKER_16]: I know you're too busy playing WarioWare to give a shit, but I just thought I'd share.

02:45:27.072 --> 02:45:31.857
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:45:33.438 --> 02:45:35.500
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to get to Ask Orange Lounge momentarily.

02:45:35.961 --> 02:45:43.127
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't forget to send in your questions in the chat room over at www.orangeloungeradio.com and we'll get to your questions.

02:45:47.068 --> 02:45:50.570
[SPEAKER_16]: I was going to bring up another story, but I decided not to.

02:45:50.670 --> 02:45:52.512
[SPEAKER_16]: So that leaves me at a loss for words.

02:45:52.572 --> 02:45:57.415
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, why don't you plug our other nightly shows that go on here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:45:57.555 --> 02:46:03.939
[SPEAKER_19]: There's Pump Up the Volume on Tuesday night, although this week, gee, I may not be able to do a show.

02:46:04.559 --> 02:46:05.040
[SPEAKER_19]: It depends.

02:46:05.140 --> 02:46:07.041
[SPEAKER_19]: If I do, I'll play a bunch of comedy.

02:46:07.421 --> 02:46:08.442
[SPEAKER_19]: But usually I play whatever.

02:46:08.482 --> 02:46:09.563
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're hanging out in the chat room...

02:46:10.143 --> 02:46:14.544
[SPEAKER_19]: You can request whatever it starts with the pre-show at a quarter to seven Pacific time.

02:46:14.564 --> 02:46:18.365
[SPEAKER_19]: The show starts at 7.30 to 10.30 and it's really random every time.

02:46:18.385 --> 02:46:23.366
[SPEAKER_19]: If you want to hear something new, unusual, something you might not normally listen to, check it out.

02:46:25.227 --> 02:46:26.167
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, sounds good.

02:46:28.487 --> 02:46:34.649
[SPEAKER_16]: In the Groove, of course, since it made its recent debut on the PlayStation 2, it's kind of...

02:46:35.871 --> 02:46:36.652
[SPEAKER_16]: www.orangeloungeradio.com

02:46:56.383 --> 02:47:04.126
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's kind of neat because it compares the games DDR and In the Groove and kind of talks about, you know, how the games are different.

02:47:04.587 --> 02:47:13.751
[SPEAKER_16]: It's kind of interesting because the only people that won't say that In the Groove is kind of a loose adaptation of DDR or whatever is Rocksoar and Red Octane themselves.

02:47:14.451 --> 02:47:15.451
[SPEAKER_16]: They just kind of ignore it there.

02:47:16.112 --> 02:47:20.234
[SPEAKER_16]: But they post a nice review and that's kind of interesting that it actually gets coverage in Wired Magazine.

02:47:20.714 --> 02:47:21.154
[SPEAKER_16]: I like that.

02:47:23.535 --> 02:47:25.296
[SPEAKER_15]: What are you giggling at over there, Loki?

02:47:26.826 --> 02:47:32.748
[SPEAKER_15]: I was playing one level of the WarioWare and I got to like level 60 and the music got so fast it was funny.

02:47:34.209 --> 02:47:36.450
[SPEAKER_15]: I was doing the hamster ED thing and that was fun.

02:47:37.030 --> 02:47:38.611
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm glad you were able to do that.

02:47:38.631 --> 02:47:46.894
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what's one I could probably rock at is the one where you have to hold it still so you just like leave your Game Boy Advance just sitting there.

02:47:48.855 --> 02:47:49.675
[SPEAKER_15]: Which I'm going to try that one.

02:47:49.975 --> 02:47:52.196
[SPEAKER_19]: What if it requires you to have it at a certain angle?

02:47:53.697 --> 02:47:56.598
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think that's the case but I'll try it.

02:47:57.685 --> 02:48:22.312
[SPEAKER_16]: One other plug I want to get in regards to In The Groove stories, and I know we have a listener that writes for this website, and he actually wrote this review, so he'll like that I'm giving this a plug, but honestly, InsidePulse.com, specifically Games.InsidePulse.com, they actually posted a review by one of our listeners, El Mullet, who writes for this website, did a review of In The Groove, and in my opinion, this...

02:48:23.274 --> 02:48:24.874
[SPEAKER_16]: Freaking sums it up perfectly.

02:48:25.314 --> 02:48:28.315
[SPEAKER_16]: This is honestly the best review.

02:48:28.395 --> 02:48:31.496
[SPEAKER_16]: This would be exactly how I feel about the game.

02:48:32.016 --> 02:48:32.356
[SPEAKER_16]: Mostly.

02:48:32.396 --> 02:48:36.657
[SPEAKER_16]: I think there was one or two things I disagreed with, but it's almost 100% exactly how I feel about the game.

02:48:36.677 --> 02:48:37.197
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's fair.

02:48:37.537 --> 02:48:42.158
[SPEAKER_16]: It talks about what is good about Indigroove and what's not so good about Indigroove and all that.

02:48:42.578 --> 02:48:43.938
[SPEAKER_16]: Check it out if you're curious.

02:48:44.038 --> 02:48:45.158
[SPEAKER_16]: InsidePulse.com.

02:48:45.319 --> 02:48:46.259
[SPEAKER_16]: I totally endorse it.

02:48:46.279 --> 02:48:47.239
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's a great review.

02:48:48.119 --> 02:48:51.682
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's go and go to the Skype line because we actually just got a call on Skype.

02:48:51.702 --> 02:48:53.143
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:48:54.824 --> 02:48:56.965
[SPEAKER_16]: This is your resident ninja spy, Dark Knight.

02:48:57.185 --> 02:48:59.487
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello, our ninja spy, Dark Knight.

02:48:59.527 --> 02:49:01.168
[SPEAKER_16]: What is on your mind tonight?

02:49:02.369 --> 02:49:02.889
[SPEAKER_12]: Nothing much.

02:49:02.909 --> 02:49:03.770
[SPEAKER_12]: Just a little bit tired.

02:49:03.810 --> 02:49:08.593
[SPEAKER_12]: Just got back from a convention around town this weekend.

02:49:08.893 --> 02:49:12.595
[SPEAKER_16]: You sound a little drained like you just went to a convention or something.

02:49:12.615 --> 02:49:14.176
[SPEAKER_16]: You sound a little out of it, but that's all right.

02:49:14.277 --> 02:49:14.877
[SPEAKER_16]: How was the convention?

02:49:15.922 --> 02:49:17.883
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, it was pretty good, actually.

02:49:17.943 --> 02:49:20.363
[SPEAKER_12]: I went to see the cosplay for the first time.

02:49:20.423 --> 02:49:23.684
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a pretty interesting cosplay skit that was going on at the convention.

02:49:23.844 --> 02:49:24.765
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, which convention is this?

02:49:25.885 --> 02:49:26.905
[SPEAKER_12]: Anime Mid-Atlantic.

02:49:27.345 --> 02:49:28.726
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, Anime Mid-Atlantic, alright.

02:49:28.846 --> 02:49:31.107
[SPEAKER_16]: So, what kind of stuff were they doing at this convention?

02:49:31.127 --> 02:49:32.887
[SPEAKER_16]: What were the big shows and big things to see?

02:49:35.088 --> 02:49:42.550
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, like I said, during the cosplay, there was one skit they had on there, which was like a Final Fantasy bit, where they had a

02:49:43.388 --> 02:49:46.269
[SPEAKER_12]: Black Mage, White Mage, and Warrior fighting the Toonberry.

02:49:47.110 --> 02:49:48.190
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was hilarious.

02:49:48.250 --> 02:49:53.913
[SPEAKER_12]: It was like, of course, a typical Toonberry, when you attack it, it's almost impossible to get a single hit off of it.

02:49:55.013 --> 02:49:56.474
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was just getting hilarious every time.

02:49:56.494 --> 02:49:58.215
[SPEAKER_12]: I was killing everybody off and everybody like that.

02:49:58.495 --> 02:50:02.697
[SPEAKER_12]: At the end, you see a guy come out holding a sign saying, Toonberry gains like 5,000 experience.

02:50:04.749 --> 02:50:06.910
[SPEAKER_12]: 540 Guild, and Get Pizza x4.

02:50:06.970 --> 02:50:12.612
[SPEAKER_16]: Did the Tomberry do the little Final Fantasy victory dance that they did in Final Fantasy where they just raised their arms up repeatedly?

02:50:12.632 --> 02:50:12.992
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

02:50:13.272 --> 02:50:14.713
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, that's awesome.

02:50:14.733 --> 02:50:14.873
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

02:50:15.213 --> 02:50:15.773
[SPEAKER_12]: It was great.

02:50:16.534 --> 02:50:20.755
[SPEAKER_12]: And there was one cosplay that was really, really good.

02:50:20.775 --> 02:50:21.336
[SPEAKER_12]: What's that?

02:50:21.696 --> 02:50:23.136
[SPEAKER_12]: It was beautifully performed.

02:50:23.196 --> 02:50:26.418
[SPEAKER_12]: I wish I knew what it was, but let me put it this way.

02:50:27.198 --> 02:50:32.340
[SPEAKER_12]: It involved a lot of people and flag-waving displays, and it was beautifully done.

02:50:33.127 --> 02:50:37.371
[SPEAKER_12]: and I don't know if it might have won or not, but apparently it was great.

02:50:37.631 --> 02:50:41.735
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe there'll be pictures on the internet at some point or something so you can share that with us later.

02:50:42.036 --> 02:50:47.781
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, I gotta ask, because no anime convention is incomplete without a hentai room.

02:50:47.801 --> 02:50:48.642
[SPEAKER_16]: Was there a hentai room?

02:50:50.248 --> 02:50:52.430
[SPEAKER_12]: No, actually, unfortunately not.

02:50:52.530 --> 02:50:53.110
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes!

02:50:54.311 --> 02:51:02.317
[SPEAKER_12]: Unfortunately not, but yeah, when they had the raid portion, yeah, the emergency list kind of started piling up as the raid went on during the night.

02:51:02.657 --> 02:51:03.417
[SPEAKER_16]: I see, I see.

02:51:03.538 --> 02:51:06.440
[SPEAKER_16]: So, anything else you want to share about the convention?

02:51:07.400 --> 02:51:13.825
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, at the end of the convention, the last day it was today, there was a big announcement about where it was going next year.

02:51:14.757 --> 02:51:19.460
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently, they actually are going to go to a big convention hall.

02:51:19.821 --> 02:51:23.163
[SPEAKER_12]: Anime Midnight next year will be at the Richmond Convention Center.

02:51:23.623 --> 02:51:24.083
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

02:51:24.744 --> 02:51:35.791
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, note, I think AMA is mostly like a local small con that's hosting a hotel, but apparently it's gotten so popular now that they decided to move it to the convention center, which is huge.

02:51:35.911 --> 02:51:38.293
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, when the announcement came down, the whole...

02:51:38.952 --> 02:51:40.795
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:51:56.513 --> 02:51:59.615
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it's a pretty cool convention.

02:51:59.796 --> 02:52:01.357
[SPEAKER_16]: You meet some great guests.

02:52:01.397 --> 02:52:05.860
[SPEAKER_16]: In fact, one of the voice artists is actually a local guy who you might have heard of.

02:52:05.880 --> 02:52:07.240
[SPEAKER_16]: If you remember some of his shows, Greg Ayers.

02:52:23.610 --> 02:52:24.611
[SPEAKER_12]: And what's he known for?

02:52:37.495 --> 02:52:42.358
[SPEAKER_12]: Most of all the big shows, big enemies that they have out there, he done voice works for most of them.

02:52:42.578 --> 02:52:46.620
[SPEAKER_12]: You might have heard his voice once or twice on Evangelion maybe as well.

02:52:47.761 --> 02:52:48.901
[SPEAKER_19]: I try not to watch that.

02:52:49.161 --> 02:52:49.822
[SPEAKER_19]: Ava dubbed.

02:52:51.963 --> 02:52:53.844
[SPEAKER_12]: But he's pretty good.

02:52:54.204 --> 02:52:57.486
[SPEAKER_12]: He's like one of the main people out of ADV.

02:52:57.506 --> 02:52:59.607
[SPEAKER_12]: Who is it again?

02:52:59.647 --> 02:53:00.187
[SPEAKER_12]: Who is it again?

02:53:03.700 --> 02:53:04.300
[SPEAKER_12]: Greg Ayers.

02:53:04.580 --> 02:53:04.940
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, okay.

02:53:05.621 --> 02:53:09.021
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know why for a moment I had someone else's name stuck in my head.

02:53:09.962 --> 02:53:17.824
[SPEAKER_12]: But like I said, he's a local, and like I said, for him to blow up like that is great, and to see a local guy actually succeed like that is really, really cool.

02:53:18.544 --> 02:53:19.224
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually met him.

02:53:19.244 --> 02:53:20.144
[SPEAKER_12]: He's a really cool guy.

02:53:20.664 --> 02:53:25.786
[SPEAKER_12]: So like I said, I mean, I love his work, and I hope he does a lot more.

02:53:25.806 --> 02:53:26.686
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll say it that way.

02:53:27.648 --> 02:53:28.528
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, very cool.

02:53:28.809 --> 02:53:29.809
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, congratulations.

02:53:30.009 --> 02:53:32.610
[SPEAKER_16]: The con was a big success, and who knows?

02:53:32.750 --> 02:53:34.991
[SPEAKER_16]: Hopefully we can come out to one of those cons one of these days.

02:53:35.051 --> 02:53:35.492
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll see.

02:53:36.012 --> 02:53:37.913
[SPEAKER_16]: We've got to let you go because we're going to get to some Ask Orange Lounge.

02:53:38.913 --> 02:53:39.393
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, hold on.

02:53:39.413 --> 02:53:40.734
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to throw a shameless plug in.

02:53:40.914 --> 02:53:41.574
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.

02:53:42.815 --> 02:53:48.577
[SPEAKER_12]: On Live 365, that convention actually now has a radio channel on Live 365.

02:53:50.659 --> 02:53:55.123
[SPEAKER_12]: I will post a link on the forum on the chat room.

02:53:55.163 --> 02:53:55.663
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that okay?

02:53:55.723 --> 02:53:56.283
[SPEAKER_16]: That's fine.

02:53:56.303 --> 02:53:56.984
[SPEAKER_16]: That's absolutely fine.

02:53:57.024 --> 02:53:59.106
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm all for supporting other Live 365 stations.

02:53:59.166 --> 02:54:00.146
[SPEAKER_16]: Just don't forget about us.

02:54:00.306 --> 02:54:00.927
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all I ask.

02:54:01.788 --> 02:54:02.708
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, trust me, I won't.

02:54:02.928 --> 02:54:05.270
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I said, if you like anime and stuff, check it out.

02:54:05.390 --> 02:54:05.811
[SPEAKER_16]: Sounds good.

02:54:05.831 --> 02:54:06.431
[SPEAKER_16]: Check it out then.

02:54:06.951 --> 02:54:15.878
[SPEAKER_16]: I think internet radio is where it's at, so definitely listen to internet radio stations including us and Anime Mid-Atlantic and whatever tickles your fancy.

02:54:17.159 --> 02:54:17.399
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

02:54:17.419 --> 02:54:18.200
[SPEAKER_12]: Y'all guys have a good night.

02:54:18.240 --> 02:54:18.800
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, you too.

02:54:19.261 --> 02:54:19.661
[SPEAKER_16]: Have a good one.

02:54:20.976 --> 02:54:25.439
[SPEAKER_15]: Just in case anyone out there is playing WarioWare Twisted, you want to know what it sounds like at level 150?

02:54:26.319 --> 02:54:33.503
[SPEAKER_16]: That's lovely, thank you.

02:54:33.523 --> 02:54:34.904
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to come over there and shake that.

02:54:35.864 --> 02:54:41.347
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm playing the Do Not Move one and it's so easy to win because you just set it down and...

02:54:41.638 --> 02:54:42.279
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:55:00.390 --> 02:55:02.832
[SPEAKER_16]: That was the whole concept, so to speak, I guess.

02:55:04.973 --> 02:55:12.299
[SPEAKER_16]: I got to like 350, and my fingers were practically starting to bleed because I just was whacking that button so much.

02:55:12.479 --> 02:55:12.859
[SPEAKER_16]: The button!

02:55:12.979 --> 02:55:13.360
[SPEAKER_16]: The button!

02:55:16.682 --> 02:55:18.363
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's go to some Ask Orange Lounge.

02:55:18.383 --> 02:55:19.364
[SPEAKER_16]: We've only got a few questions.

02:55:19.384 --> 02:55:19.724
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all right.

02:55:19.744 --> 02:55:20.565
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't have a lot of show left.

02:55:21.505 --> 02:55:24.388
[SPEAKER_16]: Whoa, that's not the right theme music.

02:55:24.629 --> 02:55:28.593
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the Ask... That's Wedding Chat.

02:55:28.693 --> 02:55:31.376
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the Ask Satan portion of the show.

02:55:32.537 --> 02:55:33.398
[SPEAKER_16]: My bad, you guys.

02:55:35.160 --> 02:55:35.861
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry about that.

02:55:37.863 --> 02:55:39.164
[SPEAKER_16]: Marriage Talk with Count Dracula.

02:55:42.901 --> 02:55:45.864
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid questions.

02:55:46.304 --> 02:55:49.527
[SPEAKER_16]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

02:55:50.028 --> 02:55:56.975
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a good thing it's just DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki, and not Satan, or else the theme music would sound something like this.

02:56:05.183 --> 02:56:06.124
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's get to the questions.

02:56:07.535 --> 02:56:16.060
[SPEAKER_16]: Illusion wants to know, in your guys' opinions, is Jem truly, truly, truly outrageous?

02:56:18.381 --> 02:56:20.282
[SPEAKER_16]: Truly, truly, truly outrageous.

02:56:20.402 --> 02:56:21.262
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, you know what?

02:56:21.322 --> 02:56:23.103
[SPEAKER_16]: And the Misfits are bitter.

02:56:23.143 --> 02:56:23.984
[SPEAKER_16]: They're gonna get her.

02:56:24.624 --> 02:56:27.406
[SPEAKER_16]: The Misfits, their songs are better, and they're gonna get her.

02:56:30.267 --> 02:56:31.508
[SPEAKER_16]: The Misfits were better people.

02:56:34.391 --> 02:56:43.675
[SPEAKER_16]: Misty wants to know, does it still count as a hentai room if it was only running from 2-7am on Saturday and Sunday when most of the little kitties are asleep?

02:56:45.396 --> 02:56:46.857
[SPEAKER_19]: It turns hentai and then changes back.

02:56:48.937 --> 02:56:50.058
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it works for me.

02:56:57.881 --> 02:56:59.082
[SPEAKER_16]: Hentai is hentai, people.

02:57:00.502 --> 02:57:01.603
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the important thing to remember.

02:57:03.663 --> 02:57:06.747
[SPEAKER_16]: Doobs wants to know, oh, I'm sorry, that was his FU.

02:57:07.087 --> 02:57:10.031
[SPEAKER_16]: Why does everyone hate Pump It Up slash In The Groove 2?

02:57:11.152 --> 02:57:13.535
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't really think it's that bad of an idea.

02:57:13.695 --> 02:57:16.398
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd like to play Pump It Up and In The Groove at the same time.

02:57:16.919 --> 02:57:21.484
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, let me clarify something for you, though, because I think this is going to be a common misconception.

02:57:22.481 --> 02:57:23.342
[SPEAKER_16]: With Pump It Up!

02:57:23.362 --> 02:57:26.925
[SPEAKER_16]: In the Groove 2, you will not be able to play both games at the same time.

02:57:27.326 --> 02:57:32.391
[SPEAKER_16]: Think of it as a spin-off series, that basically In the Groove is being absorbed into the Pump It Up!

02:57:32.431 --> 02:57:32.711
[SPEAKER_16]: series.

02:57:32.991 --> 02:57:42.680
[SPEAKER_16]: This does not mean that In the Groove will suddenly have five arrows or whatever, and I don't know if you were misinterpreting this, but I'm saying this in general for anybody who is thinking this way, just in general.

02:57:44.262 --> 02:57:47.505
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not suddenly going to mean that In the Groove turns into a five-arrow dancing game.

02:57:47.904 --> 02:57:48.484
[SPEAKER_16]: The Ocho The Ocho

02:58:18.604 --> 02:58:23.726
[SPEAKER_16]: God, that is... Yeah, it's just about their, you know, partnership with Animero.

02:58:24.106 --> 02:58:26.507
[SPEAKER_16]: And they're actually going to get it in a good cabinet.

02:58:26.747 --> 02:58:34.310
[SPEAKER_16]: And to answer the other part of the question, why does everyone hate Pump It Up in the Group 2, I will defer that to Loki, because he is the one that is most full of spite when it comes to those games.

02:58:34.430 --> 02:58:34.590
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki.

02:58:35.328 --> 02:58:36.009
[SPEAKER_15]: It sucks.

02:58:36.049 --> 02:58:37.109
[SPEAKER_15]: The first game sucked.

02:58:37.129 --> 02:58:38.830
[SPEAKER_15]: The second one's going to suck as well.

02:58:39.130 --> 02:58:41.252
[SPEAKER_15]: What more do I need to ask?

02:58:41.692 --> 02:58:46.355
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to be a little hopeful for the second one just because I really like the Pump It Up cabinets a whole bunch.

02:58:46.575 --> 02:58:53.459
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, we'll check out the brand new cabinets with their brand spanking new huge monitor.

02:58:53.499 --> 02:58:55.781
[SPEAKER_15]: They'll be like, wow, ugly graphics, put bigger.

02:58:55.801 --> 02:58:56.261
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait a minute.

02:58:56.401 --> 02:58:59.483
[SPEAKER_15]: It sucks is the blandest description I've ever heard, though.

02:58:59.523 --> 02:59:00.404
[SPEAKER_15]: Why does it suck?

02:59:01.104 --> 02:59:01.764
[SPEAKER_15]: Why does it suck?

02:59:01.805 --> 02:59:02.585
[SPEAKER_15]: The graphics suck.

02:59:02.864 --> 02:59:04.185
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, there's 12 and 13 footers in it.

02:59:04.205 --> 02:59:07.907
[SPEAKER_15]: Isn't that what the future of dance gaming is all about?

02:59:32.594 --> 02:59:33.614
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah, try that on a softpad.

02:59:34.174 --> 02:59:34.654
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, yeah.

02:59:34.875 --> 02:59:35.395
[SPEAKER_16]: I was just curious.

02:59:35.555 --> 02:59:40.076
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, when you can't do like four footers on a softpad, yeah, 13 feet, that's gonna rock.

02:59:40.216 --> 02:59:42.236
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, yeah, well, that's where it's at.

02:59:42.856 --> 02:59:43.297
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

02:59:43.317 --> 02:59:43.937
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

02:59:46.517 --> 02:59:55.119
[SPEAKER_16]: I, I, I'm still, I say, in the groove, it's not as good as the fanboys and girls say it is, but it's not as bad as Loki says it is either.

02:59:56.120 --> 02:59:57.240
[SPEAKER_16]: Or the haters say.

02:59:57.320 --> 02:59:59.380
[SPEAKER_16]: It's, it's just, it's, it's there.

02:59:59.660 --> 03:00:00.581
[SPEAKER_16]: It's another dance game.

03:00:00.721 --> 03:00:01.501
[SPEAKER_16]: It's, it's fine.

03:00:01.741 --> 03:00:02.201
[SPEAKER_16]: Whatever, it's,

03:00:02.726 --> 03:00:05.847
[SPEAKER_16]: For me, it is kind of a holdover until new DDR, honestly.

03:00:06.167 --> 03:00:08.228
[SPEAKER_16]: Which I hope will happen in the arcade someday.

03:00:09.808 --> 03:00:10.769
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'm not going to hold my breath.

03:00:10.789 --> 03:00:13.509
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope.

03:00:14.029 --> 03:00:15.550
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope those kinds of rumors are true.

03:00:15.590 --> 03:00:16.290
[SPEAKER_16]: I really hope so.

03:00:17.931 --> 03:00:19.731
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, that's the end of the show.

03:00:19.811 --> 03:00:24.693
[SPEAKER_16]: It's time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts, starting with Sigurd, Miklatov, Shane, whatever the hell your name is.

03:00:26.693 --> 03:00:29.314
[SPEAKER_14]: Taco Bell has a new food item that's really good.

03:00:31.855 --> 03:00:32.135
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki.

03:00:33.823 --> 03:00:45.746
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't eat at Taco Bell because, you know, it looks like runny poop and it gives you runny poop, so the end.

03:00:46.667 --> 03:00:49.107
[SPEAKER_16]: My final thought is I want a Power Max.

03:00:49.147 --> 03:00:50.008
[SPEAKER_16]: Somebody give me $1,600.

03:00:50.468 --> 03:00:52.128
[SPEAKER_16]: And Loki, don't you open your mouth.

03:00:52.188 --> 03:00:54.029
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to get into this discussion with you.

03:00:56.326 --> 03:00:56.986
[SPEAKER_15]: What exactly?

03:00:57.546 --> 03:00:59.287
[SPEAKER_15]: What power would that have?

03:00:59.947 --> 03:01:01.828
[SPEAKER_15]: The power to crash.

03:01:02.128 --> 03:01:03.608
[SPEAKER_15]: The power to run nothing.

03:01:03.928 --> 03:01:05.469
[SPEAKER_15]: The power to play no game.

03:01:06.549 --> 03:01:08.770
[SPEAKER_19]: I actually want a G5.

03:01:10.070 --> 03:01:11.070
[SPEAKER_19]: But I'm into graphic art.

03:01:11.250 --> 03:01:16.392
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm waiting for Loki to say something about, you know, Macintoshes are in the groove of the computer market or something.

03:01:18.166 --> 03:01:26.032
[SPEAKER_19]: I am actually thinking of saving up for a G5 tower, just because since my major is mostly graphic based.

03:01:26.093 --> 03:01:28.755
[SPEAKER_16]: Look people, I want one because they're pretty, alright?

03:01:28.795 --> 03:01:29.175
[SPEAKER_16]: That's it.

03:01:29.595 --> 03:01:32.558
[SPEAKER_19]: I want one, I have a legitimate reason for wanting one.

03:01:32.918 --> 03:01:34.619
[SPEAKER_19]: You want one for aesthetic value?

03:01:34.780 --> 03:01:37.502
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I have real value for them.

03:01:37.822 --> 03:01:43.827
[SPEAKER_16]: I like the idea that they do the sound, I want things like GarageBand and those types of programs.

03:01:44.087 --> 03:01:44.968
[SPEAKER_16]: I think they could enhance our show.

03:01:47.329 --> 03:01:49.270
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want Photoshop to be able to run decently.

03:01:50.230 --> 03:01:54.532
[SPEAKER_19]: And honestly, my work comes out a lot better using the G5 at school than using my PC.

03:01:56.133 --> 03:01:56.433
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

03:01:57.753 --> 03:01:58.874
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

03:01:59.114 --> 03:02:00.194
[SPEAKER_19]: Reject false icons.

03:02:01.235 --> 03:02:02.335
[SPEAKER_16]: Set Britney Spears on fire.

03:02:02.995 --> 03:02:07.637
[SPEAKER_16]: And the final word of the show, one word to sum everything up and let us know where we stand.

03:02:07.657 --> 03:02:09.018
[SPEAKER_16]: I gave it to you last week, didn't I, Seeker?

03:02:10.620 --> 03:02:11.080
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, fine.

03:02:11.101 --> 03:02:12.262
[SPEAKER_16]: You can have tonight's final word.

03:02:12.322 --> 03:02:13.222
[SPEAKER_16]: See you guys next week.

[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for listening, you guys.

03:02:14.684 --> 03:02:17.987
[SPEAKER_16]: And the final word of the show is... Hungry.

03:02:19.568 --> 03:02:24.452
[SPEAKER_03]: That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

[SPEAKER_16]: But somebody said their ignition pad did it.
