think they must be ranked in the top ten over on the alley, I don't know. Anyway, my

01:44.200 --> 01:47.360
name is Rob Roberts, of course, also known as Sky. We're here to talk about games

01:47.360 --> 01:54.200
And we're gonna start off tonight's edition as we always do talking about the games that we've been playing this week dark Sakura

01:54.200 --> 01:55.200
How about you?

01:55.200 --> 01:56.880
um

01:56.880 --> 02:01.260
Fantasy star online blue burst the beta is over, right? Yes

02:01.260 --> 02:07.240
I've actually to the beta will be over as of tomorrow. So it goes pay to play and I will be

02:08.120 --> 02:10.500
Registering my account and canceling my xbox one. I

02:11.100 --> 02:16.320
Will probably be canceling the Xbox one too. I'm considering starting it on the PC, but I'm kind of on the fence

02:16.320 --> 02:21.200
I had a lot of fun with the beta, but I just feel like do I really want to commit to the demo?

02:21.200 --> 02:23.840
I kind of want us one of us

02:23.840 --> 02:30.080
I wish I wish more folks to be taking that Guild Wars model or just gouge me for 50 bucks when I buy the game

02:30.400 --> 02:32.760
Then don't charge me to pay per month anymore

02:32.760 --> 02:37.880
But I guess I don't know I think Guild Wars have been doing very successful for that reason

02:37.880 --> 02:40.480
But I guess other companies don't want to follow suit. I don't know

02:40.480 --> 02:46.320
Well, I've also been watching Dan play a lot of Fire Emblem. Lots of Fire Emblem.

02:46.320 --> 02:52.680
Which one? The sec- well, okay. It's hard for me to think of the second release in

02:52.680 --> 02:57.160
the States as the second one because it's technically the third one on the

02:57.160 --> 03:03.160
Game Boy Advance. The first one was the one that Marth and Roy were from, even if

03:03.160 --> 03:05.920
you ever played Smash Bros. Oh yeah, I know Marth and Roy. But we never got that game.

03:05.920 --> 03:11.720
hmm well Dan found a ROM of it and I found him an English patch for it so he's

03:11.720 --> 03:15.400
been quite happy playing through that and getting his fire emblem on and

03:15.400 --> 03:18.940
seeing I like seeing how the games all connect and you know honestly I'm

03:18.940 --> 03:21.920
thinking about starting to play it I hate turn-based strategy but I would

03:21.920 --> 03:25.800
play this fire emblems game I never really got into I just need to give it a

03:25.800 --> 03:29.300
second look I think I don't know I just I don't know why one of the rarest games

03:29.300 --> 03:34.240
I own is the macross strategy game on the turbo graphics or the PC Engine duo

03:34.240 --> 03:38.200
Oh, and I hate that game. I hate it. I just have it cuz it's hard to get

03:38.840 --> 03:43.720
Seriously, well, you have night trap right and that game sucks. Well, yeah, but night trap you can find anywhere

03:43.720 --> 03:45.720
Oh, I thought that was a rare one. Oh

03:46.400 --> 03:52.140
You find it and they say it's very blah blah blah. I'm not much of a cuz what's your face from the fat from?

03:53.240 --> 03:57.920
Different strokes she died. Yeah, she killed herself. Did she she OD'd

03:58.960 --> 04:00.960
after being in night trap

04:00.960 --> 04:05.800
I'd slip my eyes be nice. I remember down the block not across the street

04:07.000 --> 04:12.080
If I were in night trap, I would do it if I were desperate enough to be a night trap

04:12.880 --> 04:14.260
Wow

04:14.260 --> 04:17.520
Okay, not really. I'd be like, okay. I have money

04:18.320 --> 04:23.460
It's better than porn. Yeah, I was stupid for the stupid game could be worse could be born anything else you've been playing

04:23.460 --> 04:38.460
Only the games on the Gorillaz webpage. I've been playing with the darts at the toilet.

04:38.460 --> 04:41.900
You know what, we'll come back to web games in a minute. Loki, what have you been playing

04:41.900 --> 04:42.900
this week?

04:42.900 --> 04:48.980
I played a little bit, very briefly, of Tetris Worlds for the Game Boy Advance, and it's

04:48.980 --> 04:54.480
It's Tetris in eight different forms or seven different forms, all of which are just too

04:54.480 --> 04:55.660
damn similar.

04:55.660 --> 04:57.320
So Tetris is Tetris.

04:57.320 --> 05:00.820
And then I played WarioWare Twisted, actually I played WarioWare Twisted about five minutes

05:00.820 --> 05:08.180
ago, so it's fun and it has a bunch of weird, stupid minigames in it that are just fun and

05:08.180 --> 05:11.660
just strange, like you can grate cake.

05:11.660 --> 05:12.660
Like you grate cheese.

05:12.660 --> 05:15.120
Is that an actual minigame or is that one of the things you unlock?

05:15.120 --> 05:16.260
It's one of the things you unlock.

05:16.260 --> 05:20.980
like a little toy, and then they have, um, it's just a bunch of whole fun stuff you can

05:20.980 --> 05:25.060
do, and since WarioWare Twisted actually has a gyroscope built into the bottom of it, you

05:25.060 --> 05:30.100
can actually, most of the game is played using the A button and tilting your Game Boy Advance

05:30.100 --> 05:33.980
or Nintendo DS.

05:33.980 --> 05:36.560
What do you think of this game compared to WarioWare Touched?

05:36.560 --> 05:37.560
I haven't played WarioWare Touched.

05:37.560 --> 05:38.560
Oh, I thought you had.

05:38.560 --> 05:39.560
I need to pick it up, though.

05:39.560 --> 05:41.920
I thought about picking it up and I need to go do that.

05:41.920 --> 05:45.860
You know, most people I've talked to that have played all the games say that, uh, Twisted

05:45.860 --> 05:50.420
Twisted is the best, Touched is the worst, with the first one being in the middle somewhere,

05:50.420 --> 05:51.420
so...

05:51.420 --> 05:52.420
Well, I most...

05:52.420 --> 05:57.080
Let me just put it this way, Warrior Warrior Twisted is a very short game.

05:57.080 --> 05:58.740
Most of the Warrior Warrior games are, though.

05:58.740 --> 06:02.460
It's a very short game at the very end, but like, the last level's hard, because you only

06:02.460 --> 06:07.300
have one life, and all the games get very hard on you all of a sudden, and so, you know...

06:07.300 --> 06:09.900
But I saw your cartridge, you don't have very many unlocks yet, so...

06:09.900 --> 06:13.860
Yeah, but see, here's the thing, though, is every time I play the game and I get up to

06:13.860 --> 06:18.340
like stage nine or whatever you get an unlock every time so I can keep playing

06:18.340 --> 06:22.780
the same stage over and over and I can just get unlocks that way but uh yeah

06:22.780 --> 06:26.460
the thing is so is because Nellie was playing some of the older stages so she

06:26.460 --> 06:29.860
was unlocking games I didn't have before so I go and play my game also there's

06:29.860 --> 06:34.780
these games like what the hell do I have to do here yes it was funny a lot of fun

06:34.780 --> 06:41.300
though anything else um Final Fantasy 11 a little bit I got to play that I'm

06:41.300 --> 06:45.460
still wish they'd fixed their server problem, whatever it is, because it like

06:45.460 --> 06:48.940
almost the same time every day. Do you think that that's now becoming the

06:48.940 --> 06:53.300
scapegoat for all their problems? The DOS attacks is now like the scapegoat? I don't

06:53.300 --> 06:56.500
even know if that's the case it's just something because when their server

06:56.500 --> 07:01.940
crashes it's like everything like you can't get in their lobby you can't it's

07:01.940 --> 07:07.180
like their complete servers all of them go down or something. Yesterday's though

07:07.180 --> 07:12.200
So the lobby didn't go down but I couldn't log back in or it was allowing me to log in

07:12.200 --> 07:16.400
but it was trying to load the level and it couldn't load anything so I just backed out

07:16.400 --> 07:18.000
of it.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.800
But I don't know what the problem is and I know that it stopped me from playing a few

07:21.800 --> 07:27.800
times and it's always around the same time usually around 11pmish around there is when

07:27.800 --> 07:28.800
it stops.

07:28.800 --> 07:34.960
Which is great because right before that happened Nelly was bitching at me about, Nelly my fiance,

07:34.960 --> 07:39.600
bitching at me how I was playing... Not the rapper. No, not the rapper. She was saying

07:39.600 --> 07:45.320
how I was playing this stupid game and stuff and how I should, you know, come pay attention

07:45.320 --> 07:50.160
to her or something and then the game, you know, started crashing on me. I'm like...

07:50.160 --> 07:53.980
Are you sure she just didn't pull the plug? Oh, I'm positive, because my cable modem...

07:53.980 --> 08:00.180
My cable modem is right on my desk. It's a DOF attack, Denial of Fiance. No, no, no.

08:00.180 --> 08:05.900
The game, she was just being cranky, I mean, she's just like-

08:05.900 --> 08:07.900
Typical- Nevermind, they're not your sessions.

08:07.900 --> 08:08.900
Yeah, seriously, typical-

08:08.900 --> 08:09.900
I have a ferret!

08:09.900 --> 08:12.900
Typical woman, she's like- I don't wanna-

08:12.900 --> 08:13.900
I didn't say it, I didn't say it.

08:13.900 --> 08:14.900
She says, she's like-

08:14.900 --> 08:16.780
Okay, this shit doesn't happen in my house.

08:16.780 --> 08:19.700
I don't wanna go outside, but I don't wanna stay inside.

08:19.700 --> 08:23.380
Well there's no, there's no in between, you can't not go outside and not stay inside.

08:23.380 --> 08:25.380
Tell her to go sit in the doorway.

08:25.380 --> 08:26.380
Patio.

08:26.380 --> 08:29.660
This shit does not happen in my house!

08:29.660 --> 08:34.660
It's like, get your ass off the PS2 because I want to play fucking Silent Hill.

08:34.660 --> 08:38.140
Yeah, it's never that. I mean, it's just like...

08:38.140 --> 08:41.580
Tell her to take up smoking. She's been doing cross-stitch.

08:41.580 --> 08:45.460
So, you know, more power to her. Alright.

08:45.460 --> 08:49.540
MyGamingWeek, I also checked out WarioWare Twisted for a little bit

08:49.540 --> 08:52.960
just because I had to play the Kid Icarus stage, okay? Because,

08:52.960 --> 08:57.080
damn that's a game they need to bring back. Why? It's been how many years?

08:57.080 --> 09:00.200
Why have they not brought that game back? I'm so upset but

09:00.200 --> 09:04.640
they tease us in WarioWare Twisted with a level inspired by Kid O'Grith.

09:04.640 --> 09:07.920
They have the boss battle for the retro games

09:07.920 --> 09:11.440
is you're playing Super Mario Brothers but it's like

09:11.440 --> 09:15.240
around the world. Yeah, it's kinda cool. I like that.

09:15.240 --> 09:18.520
I got that far. I got to see that. So that was kinda cool.

09:18.520 --> 09:21.720
I like the game. It's neat. I'm gonna have to pick it up and check it out for myself.

09:21.720 --> 09:26.020
I didn't run out and get this the day it came out though because I was

09:26.020 --> 09:28.520
kind of disappointed in the long run with Touched.

09:28.520 --> 09:32.120
None of the unlocks were really that great but I'm kind of impressed with some

09:32.120 --> 09:33.760
of the things I'm seeing in Twisted so far.

09:33.760 --> 09:37.200
I like that they have a lot more than minigames. I played the apple shooter or

09:37.200 --> 09:39.920
whatever that thing was. That's a lot of fun. That was kind of funny, I like that.

09:39.920 --> 09:43.400
And also like they have this sheep counting one that's pretty hard because they

09:43.400 --> 09:47.520
Oh man, it pissed me off yesterday. I was like getting really far in it. All of a sudden the sheep stop

09:47.520 --> 09:51.320
and then they run really fast and they run into the wall and then you're fucked.

09:51.320 --> 09:55.520
And then they have, like, another one that's ski jumping that's pretty fun, and then, um...

09:55.520 --> 09:58.820
uh, Space Boomerang, which is just strange.

09:58.820 --> 09:59.820
Wow. Crazy.

10:01.620 --> 10:02.120
I...

10:02.920 --> 10:04.820
I have to play this if you get to murder sheep.

10:06.020 --> 10:07.420
It's like, like in Lemmings, right?

10:07.820 --> 10:11.020
Well, you don't get to murder sheep that you're not trying to murder sheep,

10:11.020 --> 10:14.820
it's just that they smash into the wall and then you get sheep, like, uh...

10:15.120 --> 10:17.020
That just reminds me of a commercial.

10:17.020 --> 10:19.120
But you get to great cakes, DarkCyber, you get to great them.

10:19.120 --> 10:19.920
And carrots!

10:19.920 --> 10:25.100
This reminds me of a commercial that I saw today, Dan went on the classic video game

10:25.100 --> 10:31.220
commercial website and they had one for a football game, as in soccer, of this old man

10:31.220 --> 10:35.900
lecturing his dog on, you know, don't let the sheep make fun of you, go out and get

10:35.900 --> 10:39.660
them, and so the dog's herding him in here, crowd cheering like it's playing with a goal

10:39.660 --> 10:43.540
and everything and he's herding the sheep, but that's what that made me think of.

10:43.540 --> 10:48.920
There's also a love tester on here, it's two players, it's a compatibility tester, it's

10:48.920 --> 10:54.260
quite funny because you know Nellie didn't get it so we scored like an 18

10:54.260 --> 10:58.620
out of 100 because she didn't she's like she's like I wasn't reading the stream

10:58.620 --> 11:02.780
like you're supposed to be paying attention yes this this is this marriage is gonna be

11:02.780 --> 11:06.820
happily ever after of course she wasn't paying attention as usual never pays

11:06.820 --> 11:11.060
attention to me I hope she doesn't figure out how to download bodcast right

11:11.060 --> 11:20.620
I'm going to give you advice on how to deal with women and this could be for

11:20.620 --> 11:27.220
anybody out there listening smile and nod and then ask forgiveness later and

11:27.220 --> 11:37.820
this is coming from a woman smile or not learn the fine art of filtering when you

11:37.820 --> 11:44.100
start to hear the pitch rise just a little bit so you know why don't we just

11:44.100 --> 11:48.380
take a moment and sit down and talk about this can we can we get away from

11:48.380 --> 11:52.580
the women are from Venus and men are Mars chat for a minute I got it because

11:52.580 --> 11:58.300
I will I will totally admit that we're from like the moon if I Venus you've

11:58.300 --> 12:04.580
been crazy town yeah all right stop enough no I'm as a woman yes I can

12:04.580 --> 12:09.580
vouch for this, we're nuts. But so are men, because men are stupid. Sorry.

12:09.580 --> 12:11.580
Stop. I'm willing to live with that.

12:11.580 --> 12:16.420
Stop. Alright, anyway, nah, games. I'm gonna make you wrestle this out or something. You're

12:16.420 --> 12:19.460
gonna have a rumble roses battle to figure this one out.

12:19.460 --> 12:23.420
I love my games are in a box! Alright, anyway, games. The other games I've

12:23.420 --> 12:27.980
been playing this week, I don't know why, but I've been getting into the PopCap games,

12:27.980 --> 12:31.900
which is kind of the laughing stock of the game world, I think, in some respects. But

12:31.900 --> 12:33.740
You've all been addicted to one at some point.

12:33.740 --> 12:37.360
Tell me you did not play Bejeweled when it first came out and thought it was cool in

12:37.360 --> 12:38.360
San Aquarium.

12:38.360 --> 12:40.480
Bejeweled is a piece of shit.

12:40.480 --> 12:44.480
I can say without a doubt that I have never played any Pop Camp games ever.

12:44.480 --> 12:45.480
I had Neopets.

12:45.480 --> 12:50.400
Okay, well that's laughable, so I feel better.

12:50.400 --> 12:54.660
I was very, very good at that bullshit game they had on there.

12:54.660 --> 13:01.140
I don't know why, but I've just been all about playing like Zuma and like all the games that

13:01.140 --> 13:07.200
are on there at san aquarium I love that game it's awesome anyway I know I feel

13:07.200 --> 13:10.840
like I'm letting everybody down by admitting that I play popcap games

13:10.840 --> 13:15.840
because they're the same games that like the you know 50 something year old women

13:15.840 --> 13:19.860
I work with play on their breaks is that like bookworm is that like Apple saying

13:19.860 --> 13:23.960
you know we're gonna put Intel processors in our PCs now we're letting

13:23.960 --> 13:30.000
you down oh well all right anyway let's move on to some more gaming news we

13:30.000 --> 13:32.680
want to do a follow-up to a gaming story we were talking about a couple weeks ago

13:32.680 --> 13:36.080
the gaming actors you might remember they were threatening to go on strike

13:36.080 --> 13:40.000
this would have to do with the voice actors they did vote and actually a

13:40.000 --> 13:45.440
majority voted to strike but they needed to have a super majority in order to in

13:45.440 --> 13:50.280
order to strike two-thirds and they did not achieve that just no ordinary

13:50.280 --> 13:56.160
majority will do we need super maturity so basically right now is that even a

13:56.160 --> 14:00.760
real concept or is that just saying we don't really care what you think. I don't

14:00.760 --> 14:03.560
know but anyway this is the contract it's now going to be good through the

14:03.560 --> 14:08.920
end of 2008 it will grant the voice actors an increase in pay up to 36%

14:08.920 --> 14:13.880
through the duration of the contract the first raise which will be a 25% hike

14:13.880 --> 14:18.520
goes into effect July 1st if you're curious how much they make right now the

14:18.520 --> 14:23.720
minimum rate for a four hour voice acting session $556 so that's going up by

14:23.720 --> 14:28.280
25 percent. I'm gonna be a voice actor now. One thing that the voice actors didn't get

14:28.280 --> 14:31.440
was the residuals. You might remember that this was a big thing they were pushing for

14:31.440 --> 14:35.200
was they want to get, if the game's successful, they want a chunk of the profits because the

14:35.200 --> 14:39.720
actors feel that they contribute to that, so they wanted that. They did not get that.

14:39.720 --> 14:44.000
They only got the pay raise. So, well, at least it's something, huh? So, luckily that's

14:44.000 --> 14:48.480
all settled so you'll continue to hear voices of famous people in your games. The reason

14:48.480 --> 14:51.900
that they didn't have a majority is because the voice actors were striking, so therefore

14:51.900 --> 14:58.140
they weren't speaking and so therefore when it's all in favor of you know

14:58.140 --> 15:03.700
striking say I you are a dumbass all right moving on to a follow-up from

15:03.700 --> 15:07.820
another story we did a couple weeks ago a couple months ago at this point can

15:07.820 --> 15:10.140
you believe we've been doing this crap that long

15:10.140 --> 15:13.940
GameStop and EB you might remember it was announced they're gonna merge into

15:13.940 --> 15:19.260
this powerhouse gaming store but remember as we said to sum it up GameStop

15:19.260 --> 15:24.100
and EB were not each other's competition the real competition Walmart Target so

15:24.100 --> 15:30.120
now they're joining forces the merger was okayed by the federal government so

15:30.120 --> 15:34.260
it's a done deal it will happen so those of you guys that maybe work for one or

15:34.260 --> 15:38.380
the other that were a little bit nervous about teaming up with the enemy sorry

15:38.380 --> 15:41.980
it's it's a done deal dude they're the same store already I mean it's just like

15:41.980 --> 15:47.140
you can literally put like a GameStop sign out from EB and it would look just

15:47.140 --> 15:51.100
Well, you know one thing one thing that you may not realize is that and this is something I learned today

15:51.100 --> 15:52.500
Is that they advertise match?

15:52.500 --> 15:57.420
So if EB's running an ad GameStop will match that and now granted this would be you know

15:57.460 --> 16:01.280
Some stores may not go for this but most stores are gonna do this any you know

16:01.980 --> 16:06.280
Store that wants to stay in business will do the ad matching so you can even take in an ad from EB games to a

16:06.280 --> 16:08.280
GameStop and you know

16:08.620 --> 16:11.540
Get whatever but I would probably have to be one within the same town

16:11.540 --> 16:13.540
I'm sure there are laws don't take my word for it

16:13.540 --> 16:17.360
it asking GameStop or an EB manager if you're curious for more details on their

16:17.360 --> 16:21.720
policies but I'm just trying to say that they can you know they're already one

16:21.720 --> 16:25.480
store when you have that policy right and they are ruining these games new

16:25.480 --> 16:30.760
games all the systems engage setups in both stores I don't know why engage

16:30.760 --> 16:36.720
games going in the discount bin the engage is gone from Dan store I actually

16:36.720 --> 16:40.840
overheard a guy in a one of the store I was at one of the other store today and

16:40.840 --> 16:45.360
and actually overheard a guy asking for help on the Engage tech support and I

16:45.360 --> 16:47.440
just felt like walking by going dude just throw it away

16:47.440 --> 16:50.440
stop wasting your time. The taco of doom

16:50.440 --> 16:55.320
it was just sad walking through E3 and seeing what a big beautiful setup they had

16:55.320 --> 17:00.000
and all of five people there including us as we were passing through it

17:00.000 --> 17:06.080
I was trying not to make any sub movements in case if any of the Engage Arena staff

17:06.080 --> 17:06.800
might see me

17:06.800 --> 17:13.000
someone's interested get him I thought someone was heading to me I'm like dude

17:13.000 --> 17:17.540
it only took me I swear to you 30 seconds of playing civilization on the

17:17.540 --> 17:23.300
engage because I just had civilization is one of my probably a naughty and keep

17:23.300 --> 17:26.620
in mind I was addicted to Final Fantasy 11 for two and a half years civilization

17:26.620 --> 17:30.620
I was addicted to for a longer period and I absolutely love that game is my

17:30.620 --> 17:35.540
favorite PC game of all time so I had to see what happened to it on the engage

17:35.540 --> 17:39.460
30 seconds or less, there was a guy over. Do you have any questions?

17:39.460 --> 17:42.660
Yeah, how do I do anything on this game?

17:42.660 --> 17:46.700
I cannot figure anything out. Why does it suck so bad?

17:46.700 --> 17:51.380
I laughed. You know what's weird though? This game is making my stomach lighting bleed.

17:51.380 --> 17:55.440
Love Civilization 1 never got into Civ 2 or 3, even though most people consider

17:55.440 --> 17:56.900
Civ 2 as the peak of the series.

17:56.900 --> 18:00.300
I never got into Civ 2 or 3, don't know why. But I'm still curious about Civ 4.

18:00.300 --> 18:05.260
Another follow-up story, lots and lots of follow-up stories tonight. Nintendo

18:05.260 --> 18:08.900
you might remember that there was this rumor going around about the revolution

18:08.900 --> 18:13.020
where they're going to be doing the downloadable games. That hasn't changed.

18:13.020 --> 18:16.220
They're still going to be offering the retro games for download in the library.

18:16.220 --> 18:21.180
No real specifics. But what did happen is that in an interview in Famitsu magazine,

18:21.180 --> 18:27.180
Nintendo president Satoru Iwata says, you guys are making up rumors out there.

18:27.180 --> 18:30.660
We never said this was going to be free. Oops!

18:30.660 --> 18:34.100
Let me try to find the exact quote here. The exact quote is

18:34.100 --> 18:37.740
baseless rumor is the exact quote there

18:37.740 --> 18:41.060
the internet discussions going on were a baseless rumor so

18:41.060 --> 18:45.660
it seems kind of obvious that Nintendo would charge for this.

18:45.660 --> 18:49.260
You know correct that. Basically they've never said that it was free anyways.

18:49.260 --> 18:50.440
They said some

18:50.440 --> 18:53.900
might be free. You know obviously it's not going to

18:53.900 --> 18:57.420
all be free because you know let's just not make any money from re-releasing our games

18:57.420 --> 18:59.100
fifty times like we do all the time.

18:59.100 --> 19:05.260
You know I I kind of found it hard to believe too that when you are releasing these classic Nintendo games such as you know

19:05.700 --> 19:06.820
Metroid

19:06.820 --> 19:13.020
Even though you can unlock Metroid through two other Metroid games either Metroid zero mission or the Metroid prime

19:13.440 --> 19:15.140
fusion link up

19:15.140 --> 19:20.740
They were charging $20 for this separately. I kind of found it hard to believe that suddenly this game would be free on the revolution

19:21.180 --> 19:23.020
so

19:23.020 --> 19:25.460
But are people gonna pay $20 for these games

19:25.460 --> 19:31.120
I don't think they will or even now if you want to get even crazier than that probably an Animal Crossing DS

19:32.060 --> 19:37.040
You've been liking another game. Maybe well. Yeah, maybe maybe we don't know we'll see

19:38.360 --> 19:40.160
Any thoughts dark soccer?

19:40.160 --> 19:45.960
It's it's why I try not to speculate on systems cuz usually it's gonna come back and shoot you in the ass

19:45.960 --> 19:50.080
Well, we got a lot of that going on with the next-gen wars heating up here. So

19:50.880 --> 19:52.880
Something to get used to speaking of war

19:52.880 --> 20:00.200
very interesting story out of China going on you might have heard about this

20:00.200 --> 20:04.960
online but there was actually a fight that broke out between two individuals

20:04.960 --> 20:13.360
in China over a virtual sword and this one Chinese guy and I will horribly

20:13.360 --> 20:18.240
pronounce this I apologize Qiyi Chengwei was the guy that attacked

20:18.240 --> 20:26.320
Xu Kalyan and murdered him basically over a dispute over an online sword and

20:26.320 --> 20:33.040
the parents are upset. Cui received a suspended death sentence for this attack.

20:33.040 --> 20:39.280
The virtual sword was sold to another gamer basically was a dispute like that

20:39.280 --> 20:43.800
the sword was stolen. The sword was stolen I guess just allegedly and

20:43.800 --> 20:49.240
then sold to another gamer for seven thousand two hundred yuan and that's six

20:49.240 --> 20:54.560
hundred dollars United States money so six hundred dollar sword got murdered

20:54.560 --> 20:59.880
over like a cracking club in Final Fantasy 11 it's about would you murder

20:59.880 --> 21:03.800
someone over a cracking club though that's insane come on you got to draw

21:03.800 --> 21:08.240
the line somewhere exactly cracking club that's just like you know knees broken I

21:08.240 --> 21:11.740
mean because that's not even you know worth that I mean granted this is a

21:11.740 --> 21:16.140
story out of China but the sad thing is I could see this happening here does

21:16.140 --> 21:20.740
anyone want to doubt me I don't doubt it at all because people are stupid you

21:20.740 --> 21:27.540
know people life allow me to get a little philosophical here please you

21:27.540 --> 21:33.380
know we live in a world where things are not the bright beautiful sunshine that

21:33.380 --> 21:42.340
you know MTV and Teletubbies wants us to think it is you know I love you but

21:42.340 --> 21:49.620
seriously it's not all about pop star drama and reality TV that's an illusion

21:49.620 --> 21:53.900
and the thing is is that people are looking you know people understand that

21:53.900 --> 21:59.820
we are really living in a pretty dark time right now with all the crap that's

21:59.820 --> 22:05.240
going on in the world and even their own lives are so mundane and maybe so

22:05.240 --> 22:09.540
unhappy that people are always looking for a form of escape that's why we watch

22:09.540 --> 22:14.120
TV that's why we listen to music that's why we're here honestly we're here to

22:14.120 --> 22:20.460
offer that to our listeners but it's the point where you start wanting to escape

22:20.460 --> 22:26.180
it to the point where you are totally immersing yourself in fantasy you know

22:26.180 --> 22:29.700
that's the point that it's gone on too far when you start losing touch like

22:29.700 --> 22:35.080
that that's when you know that's when you start losing it in your head at

22:35.080 --> 22:39.000
least there is poetic justice in this world because Britney Spears chaotic is

22:39.000 --> 22:42.960
one of the lowest rated shows on television so at least there is poetic

22:42.960 --> 22:47.000
justice I didn't mean to be down on it but that's all right that's my whole

22:47.000 --> 22:51.320
theory on this whole you know epidemic of people immersing themselves in all

22:51.320 --> 22:56.440
these MMOs is the fact that you know basically life sucks let's make some

22:56.440 --> 22:58.440
So you see MMOs as like an escape?

22:58.440 --> 23:01.440
I see it as a form- well, you know, any form of entertainment.

23:01.440 --> 23:05.440
You know what? I'll admit it. To me, Final Fantasy XI, when I was so into it, was a bit of an escape.

23:05.440 --> 23:07.440
But games in general are kind of an escape.

23:07.440 --> 23:09.440
But I don't let it blur the line with the real world.

23:09.440 --> 23:10.440
Exactly.

23:10.440 --> 23:13.440
I realize it's fictional, but unfortunately not everybody has that brain about you.

23:13.440 --> 23:14.440
But Vantage Yield doesn't exist?

23:14.440 --> 23:15.440
Shush.

23:15.440 --> 23:19.440
And I think, though, that it's these people that get too far into it.

23:19.440 --> 23:24.440
Or even, you know, get too far- you know, I have to admit, I'm a pretty rabid, you know, Guerrillas fan,

23:24.440 --> 23:28.160
point where I can't distinguish between reality and not where you think you're

23:28.160 --> 23:36.440
gonna marry Murdoch considering he's a cartoon character no but I'm saying you

23:36.440 --> 23:41.840
know there's a limit to that you know okay remember in the 80s the screaming

23:41.840 --> 23:46.020
Michael Jackson fans of the woman who thought that she was his wife and had

23:46.020 --> 23:50.320
his baby and they locked her up and to this day she still claims to be his wife

23:50.320 --> 23:56.080
that is losing yourself that is going to the point of going nutso and that's like

23:56.080 --> 24:00.080
the guy in China they were too far into their game to be able to distinguish it

24:00.080 --> 24:06.280
from reality and when you go that far that's it all right if you have any

24:06.280 --> 24:11.800
feedback comments I want to give a shout out to Jamie or you want to maybe give

24:11.800 --> 24:15.360
her a question or whatever I look forward to seeing a counterpoint to go

24:15.360 --> 24:19.300
at orange lounge radio.com to go at orange on studio calm we actually added

24:19.300 --> 24:23.540
a new section of our website, even over at orangehonored.com that says contact staff.

24:23.540 --> 24:26.900
So if you want to contact any of us, our emails are all right there, as well as the general

24:26.900 --> 24:27.900
address.

24:27.900 --> 24:33.220
And I would like to give a shout out to the people I heard from last week, to Jimmy, who

24:33.220 --> 24:36.260
likes our podcast, and Misty's back.

24:36.260 --> 24:37.620
Right on.

24:37.620 --> 24:39.580
And to Robin from PodNova.

24:39.580 --> 24:41.920
Oh, cool, hi.

24:41.920 --> 24:44.100
So hi to all you guys, thanks for writing.

24:44.100 --> 24:47.480
And I'd like to give a shout out to the people that have contacted me.

24:47.480 --> 24:54.220
Thank you to VidRx for the wonderful Blue Pill ads, I love those.

24:54.220 --> 25:05.800
And thank you to HotSluts.com for sending me ads and also I have enough free PSP offers

25:05.800 --> 25:07.740
so no thanks for those.

25:07.740 --> 25:12.400
By the way, the game in question, because I'm sure you guys are curious, what game was

25:12.400 --> 25:13.400
this?

25:13.400 --> 25:18.080
called legend of mere three so not something I've heard of here but it must

25:18.080 --> 25:22.240
be more popular overseas I think I have heard of that one actually not me what

25:22.240 --> 25:26.720
can I say all right I think I think a good follow-up piece would be dark

25:26.720 --> 25:30.200
Sakura's on a roll here so I think she needs to start dishing out her advice

25:30.200 --> 25:33.560
column here because you know we here at orange lounge radio we're not just here

25:33.560 --> 25:36.840
to talk about games all the time because if we talked about games all the time

25:36.840 --> 25:41.600
we'd have no time to go sit in the doorway so we are here to better your

25:41.600 --> 25:46.420
life with the advice column because you need to go outside once in a while and who better

25:46.420 --> 25:47.920
than our one and only DarkSakura.

25:47.920 --> 25:51.040
DarkSakura, what are you going to give the kids some advice about tonight?

25:51.040 --> 25:55.040
Today's piece of advice is how to survive when lost in the jungle.

25:55.040 --> 25:56.040
Number one.

25:56.040 --> 25:57.040
This is helpful.

25:57.040 --> 25:58.040
Yes.

25:58.040 --> 25:59.040
Number one, find water.

25:59.040 --> 26:04.360
If you do not have the means to purify water, cut sections from large water vines or cut

26:04.360 --> 26:07.720
banana trees to capture the water welling out from the stalks.

26:07.720 --> 26:11.240
Only drink water from streams and rivers as a last resort as this water will most likely

26:11.240 --> 26:19.560
2. Eat only foods that you can peel or cook. Avoid brightly colored plants or plants with

26:19.560 --> 26:23.800
a milky sap. Many of these are poisonous. Insects, grubs, and raw fish, except those

26:23.800 --> 26:28.720
with bristles or spines rather than scales, are safe to eat. Peel fruits before eating.

26:28.720 --> 26:32.280
Peels may harbor diarrhea-causing bacteria.

26:32.280 --> 26:39.400
final piece of advice yes stay out of brazil unless we might have listeners there be nice

26:39.400 --> 26:44.760
unless of course i mean in the jungle don't go to the jungle don't go to the jungle unless

26:44.760 --> 26:50.200
you can't you know go and watch out for dinosaurs and bring toilet paper because you might breathe

26:50.200 --> 26:59.240
and catch diarrhea be sure not to slip on the diarrhea in the jungle that's more usages of

26:59.240 --> 27:02.160
of the word diarrhea than we have allotted for the show, please.

27:02.160 --> 27:04.920
Loki, did you have some stories you wanted to share with us tonight?

27:04.920 --> 27:07.600
I know you're excited about this PSP hacking thing.

27:07.600 --> 27:14.600
Of course, as it's been rumored all week, you know, PSP, you know, everyone's looking

27:14.600 --> 27:21.320
for a way to run homebrew applications on version 1.5 PSP.

27:21.320 --> 27:26.200
For those not in the know, the version 1.0 PSPs were the very first ones launched in

27:26.200 --> 27:29.160
Japan and all the US ones were version 1.5.

27:29.160 --> 27:34.220
So all of us over here, unless you actually import a 1.0 version of PSP, you can't run

27:34.220 --> 27:38.000
any of those cool emulators and all that stuff.

27:38.000 --> 27:45.180
However, now there's this one website stating, yes, they found a way and they're going to

27:45.180 --> 27:51.840
launch it on June 15th, on the 15th hour.

27:51.840 --> 27:55.440
I get it, 1.5, 15.

27:55.440 --> 28:04.440
The website only4.info, they have a video on there that's showing a version 1.5 PSP

28:04.440 --> 28:05.440
running...

28:05.440 --> 28:09.440
The number 4 only 4 or only 4?

28:09.440 --> 28:12.880
Only and then the number 4.

28:12.880 --> 28:15.560
All one word.info.

28:15.560 --> 28:20.720
They have a video, people are of course saying oh it's fake and people are saying oh it's

28:20.720 --> 28:21.720
real.

28:21.720 --> 28:26.320
I guess you'll find out on Wednesday when this is actually launched.

28:26.320 --> 28:32.360
And supposedly they have a tutorial on how to make programs to run in version 1.5.

28:32.360 --> 28:38.120
And it only works in version 1.5 because whatever the hole is was fixed in version 1.51.

28:38.120 --> 28:44.440
So hopefully you haven't upgraded your PSP to anything above 1.5 because otherwise you're

28:44.440 --> 28:45.440
screwed.

28:45.440 --> 28:46.440
Interesting.

28:46.440 --> 28:52.900
know a lot of sense since also they have a brand new some brand new stuff for the

28:52.900 --> 28:59.500
PSP homebrew stuff like for example XMAME was released for the PSP and that's

28:59.500 --> 29:04.460
MAME for your PSP so you can play all your favorite arcade emulators and then

29:04.460 --> 29:12.860
also there's emulators now out for the Gameboy Color, for the Mega Drive, for a

29:12.860 --> 29:20.220
Neo Geo Pocket, just tons of stuff out there, and hopefully this will, you know, happen

29:20.220 --> 29:24.020
and we'll see this being able to play, you know, these homebrew applications.

29:24.020 --> 29:27.180
So when you go to this website on the 15th, either you're going to find the holy grail

29:27.180 --> 29:30.820
here of emulation on the PSP, or you're going to find your computer filled with spyware,

29:30.820 --> 29:33.060
because this will be a practical joke, I don't know.

29:33.060 --> 29:34.060
No, it's...

29:34.060 --> 29:35.060
I think it sounds pretty legit though.

29:35.060 --> 29:38.060
It's going to be, it'll be everywhere on the net if this is the case, because it's going

29:38.060 --> 29:41.100
to just be, it's a big thing.

29:41.100 --> 29:43.220
I'm sure you will bring us a full report.

29:43.220 --> 29:44.220
Oh, yes.

29:44.220 --> 29:49.860
And also on the other portable end, we have DS.

29:49.860 --> 29:51.740
We have Space Invaders for the DS.

29:51.740 --> 29:55.180
And they're actually playing that now.

29:55.180 --> 29:57.660
I believe they're running on Linux,

29:57.660 --> 30:01.100
because they have Linux running for the DS right now.

30:01.100 --> 30:03.100
When's it going to be installed on a toaster?

30:03.100 --> 30:05.380
Did you hear this story from earlier this week?

30:05.380 --> 30:07.060
And I don't have the article up in front of me.

30:07.060 --> 30:09.520
For some reason, I forgot to pull it up for tonight's stuff.

30:09.520 --> 30:13.720
PlayStation 3 they're saying will have Linux installed on it by default.

30:13.720 --> 30:18.400
PlayStation 3 their hard drives will come with Linux installed on them because they're not being included

30:18.400 --> 30:21.760
but they said that you would be able to install other operating systems such as

30:21.760 --> 30:22.680
Windows

30:22.680 --> 30:26.560
and Tiger which would be the Mac OS

30:26.560 --> 30:31.120
X whatever. Wow. Why anyone would do that I don't know.

30:31.120 --> 30:35.320
I don't know but supposedly they're gonna have that and I guess if you install

30:35.320 --> 30:38.300
Linux on it you'd have a pretty powerful PC right there because

30:38.300 --> 30:42.420
you know cell processing plus you know tons of USB applications you could

30:42.420 --> 30:43.180
probably run

30:43.180 --> 30:47.900
you know a keyboard and whatnot off there so who knows what the hell you're going to be there.

30:47.900 --> 30:51.100
It feels like that there's something we're missing here. I'm sure we'll get more

30:51.100 --> 30:52.620
details on this in the next video.

30:52.620 --> 30:56.060
This all sounds too good to be true. This really does sound too good to be true.

30:56.060 --> 30:59.500
Well, coming from the horse's mouth. In other news,

30:59.500 --> 31:04.180
let's see here we've got also details that the Nintendo DS

31:04.180 --> 31:07.860
outsells the Sony PSP and PlayStation 2 combined

31:07.860 --> 31:12.620
in Japan that's actually sold that well and you can probably thank that to Nintendogs

31:12.620 --> 31:14.300
because Nintendogs rocks.

31:14.300 --> 31:16.940
And I think it's going to be a big thing here too.

31:16.940 --> 31:22.140
Nintendogs actually has a little epidemic attached to it, sort of catching on the way

31:22.140 --> 31:25.060
Pokemon was, you know, the little shaky ones.

31:25.060 --> 31:32.100
You know, they're, you know, it's like I was talking to the guy at E3, they'll be, the

31:32.100 --> 31:37.780
boys start playing Nintendogs to pick up girls because the girls were all playing it and

31:37.780 --> 31:39.820
and their little puppies would bark at them.

31:39.820 --> 31:42.340
So the boys' doggies would bark back.

31:42.340 --> 31:43.180
This is gonna be very interesting

31:43.180 --> 31:45.260
when this game launches, I'm looking forward to it.

31:45.260 --> 31:47.260
Thank you very much, Loki, for letting us know

31:47.260 --> 31:49.700
what's going on in the hackin' and crackin' world.

31:49.700 --> 31:52.540
DarkSakura, how about what's going on in the UK?

31:52.540 --> 31:53.980
You got a story for the UK for us tonight?

31:53.980 --> 31:55.380
For our friends over there?

31:55.380 --> 31:57.660
I was digging through BBC News,

31:57.660 --> 32:00.940
which, you know, I actually look at BBC News every so often.

32:00.940 --> 32:03.900
This is something about a Pac-Man virtual reality thing

32:03.900 --> 32:05.660
that they were doing.

32:05.660 --> 32:13.020
actually it was the human pac-man was developed at the National University of

32:13.020 --> 32:17.660
Singapore by a mixed reality lab and what they were doing they're having it

32:17.660 --> 32:21.940
they're using GPS Bluetooth virtual reality Wi-Fi infrared and sensing

32:21.940 --> 32:27.380
mechanisms trying to create a virtual world so these people are wearing these

32:27.380 --> 32:31.700
hats these goggles and it's actually putting the dots in front of them and

32:31.700 --> 32:38.180
they're running the maze now it's pretty cool you know there's a pictures in a

32:38.180 --> 32:44.360
little bit more detail on it on the bbc.co.uk under the technology section

32:44.360 --> 32:48.980
because these pictures are hard to describe it's really it shows I saw them

32:48.980 --> 32:53.340
on another new site this week and it looked kind of weird like I've seen the

32:53.340 --> 32:57.500
live pac-man games I remember seeing it on the internet previously but not this

32:57.500 --> 33:00.680
like that was just kids running in the street pretending that one you know

33:00.680 --> 33:05.000
ghosts and stuff but I think I like that to you virtual but maybe yeah the the

33:05.000 --> 33:08.660
virtual dots that project in front of you that's kind of cool that's the new

33:08.660 --> 33:12.400
part of it the other I've seen the GPS based pac-man that's kind of well this

33:12.400 --> 33:19.080
one yeah they were using more of a radio sensor and there were people actually

33:19.080 --> 33:25.340
dressed up as pac-man and people dressed up as the ghosts being directed by

33:25.340 --> 33:32.420
people functioning as the AI and this was done in New York because they actually had

33:32.420 --> 33:38.860
it sectioned out around Central Park where it all mapped out to exactly the Pac-Man grid.

33:38.860 --> 33:46.060
But I thought this was pretty cool and what they're doing is also an experiment on the

33:46.060 --> 33:50.340
whole GPS system but also on integrated gaming.

33:50.340 --> 33:51.180
Gaming.

33:52.520 --> 33:53.360
Very cool.

33:53.360 --> 33:55.600
All right, well thanks for that report.

33:55.600 --> 33:57.760
Moving on, you might have heard about the Halo movie.

33:57.760 --> 33:59.840
Microsoft's been shipping out the Halo movie

33:59.840 --> 34:01.540
like mad this week.

34:01.540 --> 34:04.280
They sent folks dressed up in Master Chief outfits

34:04.280 --> 34:06.360
to deliver the scripts to the studios.

34:06.360 --> 34:08.100
They went all out for this.

34:08.100 --> 34:13.100
They wanted $10 million plus 15% of the box office revenue

34:13.600 --> 34:15.640
and they wanted a heck of a lot of control

34:15.640 --> 34:16.560
over the film as well.

34:16.560 --> 34:18.160
They wanted all these seats for the premiere.

34:18.160 --> 34:20.320
Now granted, some of this could be rumor,

34:20.320 --> 34:23.520
but the internet's saying they wanted seats for the premiere,

34:23.520 --> 34:26.120
and they wanted control over the actors that were going

34:26.120 --> 34:27.400
to be in it and all this stuff.

34:27.400 --> 34:29.440
Well, they got some of it.

34:29.440 --> 34:31.920
Two studios actually teamed up, Universal Pictures

34:31.920 --> 34:33.240
and 20th Century Fox.

34:33.240 --> 34:35.860
They're going to offer $5 million and 10%

34:35.860 --> 34:37.640
of the initial box office revenue.

34:37.640 --> 34:41.480
So we'll be looking at more formal details announced

34:41.480 --> 34:43.840
a little later on when all the t's are crossed

34:43.840 --> 34:47.320
and i's are dotted, but you can look for a joint studio,

34:47.320 --> 34:51.780
Halo the movie production. I'm sure it will be decent since it's got a pretty generic

34:51.780 --> 34:55.980
storyline. We need a decent video game movie, but this could be a good trend because Silent

34:55.980 --> 35:01.040
Hill is looking good, Halo has a lot of potential, Spy Hunter. Two words when it comes to the

35:01.040 --> 35:06.420
Halo movie, Starship Troopers. Yeah, yeah, yeah, Starship Troopers wasn't bad, it would

35:06.420 --> 35:12.920
be fun. Um, what was I going to say, um, Spy Hunter, that's being worked on Universal,

35:12.920 --> 35:18.360
and granted the rocks getting it but you know the rocks now becoming a more legitimate actor

35:18.360 --> 35:23.480
so it could be cool and I wouldn't think there's a lot to work with the spy hunter though so

35:23.480 --> 35:28.200
you have a lot of room to you have a with a car low yeah with spy hunter there's not

35:28.200 --> 35:32.040
a lot you got the car and your car changing with a halo you've got a very intricate story

35:32.040 --> 35:36.520
between halo halo 2 and microsoft in fact wants to make sure their story does not get

35:36.520 --> 35:40.380
screwed up by the movie they want that was very important to them because they are going

35:40.380 --> 35:43.980
to do a Halo 3, that's a big duh. They want to make sure this movie isn't going to F that

35:43.980 --> 35:47.940
out all the way. We don't want to run into Resident Evil Syndrome. You know what I'd

35:47.940 --> 35:52.780
love to see though? What's that? Red vs. Blue, the movie. Yes! Oh my god, that would be awesome.

35:52.780 --> 35:58.380
A chupa thingy! They should totally, and I would, because Red vs. Blue has kind of become

35:58.380 --> 36:02.740
like the spokesperson for Halo, sort of. So what they should do is have like, you know

36:02.740 --> 36:05.540
how they have like cartoon movies, you know how they have the little mini cartoon? Have

36:05.540 --> 36:09.980
a red vs blue little intro movie or something, that'd be kinda cool.

36:09.980 --> 36:13.460
I wonder if there's actually been any updates to Red vs Blue, because I haven't watched

36:13.460 --> 36:14.460
it since the second season.

36:14.460 --> 36:19.580
They have new seasons, but anyways, I'm surprised a lot of these things like Red vs Blue, Homestar,

36:19.580 --> 36:23.860
Runner, Strangerhood, I love the Strangerhood Theater, all that stuff, I'm surprised they

36:23.860 --> 36:27.020
just don't all team up and start their own dang network, honestly.

36:27.020 --> 36:28.020
I would watch it.

36:28.020 --> 36:29.020
I would.

36:29.020 --> 36:34.500
Okay, honestly, Red vs Blue, Internet TV Radio, no no no, seriously, Red vs Blue, The Strangerhood,

36:34.500 --> 36:39.180
these do a damn show on G4. G4 has some really weird stuff that doesn't really

36:39.180 --> 36:42.940
fit with that gaming network like their whole like you know import car thing

36:42.940 --> 36:46.700
yeah I mean that's something that should be on MTV put this stuff on there I mean

36:46.700 --> 36:51.860
it's it's done for them just publish it the end I guess it just doesn't sell I

36:51.860 --> 36:55.180
don't know anyway you got a really quick update for us on Liberty City oh yes

36:55.180 --> 36:58.940
Liberty City stories Grand Theft Auto there's a story because basically

36:58.940 --> 37:04.220
another magazine is leaked information and the magazine in question this time

37:04.220 --> 37:09.500
was the official PlayStation Magazine UK edition and hey there's some more UK

37:09.500 --> 37:15.560
news yes and if you and for our wonderful podcast listeners if you mosey

37:15.560 --> 37:20.240
on down to orange launch radio.com you can see that in the little read more

37:20.240 --> 37:25.400
section I have included six packages for your enjoyment those packages being

37:25.400 --> 37:29.800
scans of the actual magazine so you can see the wonderful in-game shots start

37:29.800 --> 37:30.960
Start moseying.

37:30.960 --> 37:31.960
Start moseying.

37:31.960 --> 37:36.520
Basically, it's going to be just like Grand Theft Auto 3, it's going to be in Liberty

37:36.520 --> 37:37.520
City again.

37:37.520 --> 37:43.840
You play as Tony Cipriani in a 1998 Liberty City, so some of the stuff is going to be

37:43.840 --> 37:44.840
a little bit different.

37:44.840 --> 37:49.200
They have the same targeting system, motorbikes, as in the later games.

37:49.200 --> 37:52.000
The missions are going to be a little bit shorter, but there's going to be more than

37:52.000 --> 37:58.680
there were in Grand Theft Auto 3, and basically one of the theories is you might be able to

37:58.680 --> 38:02.560
your own mp3s off the memory stick on your own radio station just kind of like the PC

38:02.560 --> 38:07.360
version but that's pretty much it different packages and different secret stuff but definitely

38:07.360 --> 38:11.520
worth picking up and that's going to be coming out I think in September sounds pretty cool

38:11.520 --> 38:16.560
I'm going into a very very different type of game Dig Dug is coming back and it's going

38:16.560 --> 38:23.720
to be on the DS it's called Dig Dug Digging Strike get it DS Digging Strike gonna be coming

38:23.720 --> 38:27.920
out in Japan on September 8th the very interesting thing about Dig Dug Digging Strike is that

38:27.920 --> 38:30.820
that they are taking elements of the original Dig Dug

38:30.820 --> 38:32.580
and mixing it with Dig Dug 2.

38:32.580 --> 38:33.880
Did any of you guys ever play Dig Dug 2?

38:33.880 --> 38:34.720
I'm sure you all played Dig Dug 1.

38:34.720 --> 38:35.540
Briefly.

38:35.540 --> 38:37.220
Did you ever play Dig Dug 2 with like the island

38:37.220 --> 38:42.220
and you were kind of axing off parts of the island?

38:42.340 --> 38:44.500
It was a very different style of gameplay.

38:44.500 --> 38:45.700
But what they're doing now,

38:45.700 --> 38:47.980
and this was actually announced in the latest issue again,

38:47.980 --> 38:52.380
of Famitsu Magazine, has kind of the combination

38:52.380 --> 38:55.640
where kind of you got Dig Dug 2 going on on the top screen,

38:55.640 --> 38:58.200
But then you got Dig Dug 1 going on on the bottom screen,

38:58.200 --> 39:00.400
and you move around to different parts of the island,

39:00.400 --> 39:02.400
and you kind of do the little Dig Dug 1 parts.

39:02.400 --> 39:03.440
Kind of interesting.

39:03.440 --> 39:07.240
I think it's kind of neat, just the idea of combining

39:07.240 --> 39:09.880
two games in a new way for the DS.

39:09.880 --> 39:11.120
This is kind of a cool thing.

39:11.120 --> 39:14.080
And it doesn't look like it's whoring on the touch thing.

39:14.080 --> 39:17.520
It looks like it's using the dual screen aspect of it

39:17.520 --> 39:20.280
more than just the touch, which I think is good.

39:20.280 --> 39:21.920
It's kind of interesting.

39:21.920 --> 39:24.040
The DS doesn't have to be all about touching.

39:24.040 --> 39:27.540
I'm sure they will use the touchscreen in one way or another, but I think it's kind of neat.

39:27.540 --> 39:35.100
Exactly. All right. Also moving on, Sega! Sega's launched a brand new community

39:35.100 --> 39:40.180
site. It's called Sega Link, and what it does is allows users to create their own

39:40.180 --> 39:45.260
blogs and photo albums, and you chat with other users and all that stuff. Sega Link

39:45.260 --> 39:51.300
also has a huge library with online games and board games, simple games, Sega

39:51.300 --> 39:56.840
Classic and Link Collection is what they call it. The Sega Classic section

39:56.840 --> 40:03.240
features Windows ports of Genesis titles like Golden Axe, Fantasy Star, and it

40:03.240 --> 40:09.440
would cost you about $1.12 to play for 24 hours. Not too shabby, but here's the

40:09.440 --> 40:15.880
bad news. SEGALINK.JP. It's a Japanese only site right now. Credit card to work

40:15.880 --> 40:21.880
in Japan I can get a Japanese address Sega link dot JP if you're thinking

40:21.880 --> 40:27.820
about going around the back door to get on that site might be kind of fun what I

40:27.820 --> 40:31.320
think is interesting about this article is talking about the Nintendo Revolution

40:31.320 --> 40:36.440
and of course we don't know a lot about what the Nintendo Revolution is going to

40:36.440 --> 40:40.880
offer but we do know now one thing that they will not offer they are saying and

40:40.880 --> 40:44.440
and this is GameCube Advanced that is reporting this

40:44.440 --> 40:48.500
the revolution will not support high-definition signals

40:48.500 --> 40:53.640
from the article quote Nintendo doesn't plan for the system to be HD compatible

40:53.640 --> 40:56.560
as with that comes a higher price for both the consumer

40:56.560 --> 41:00.960
and also the developer creating the game very interesting if you want more

41:00.960 --> 41:02.440
information on that GC

41:02.440 --> 41:06.320
dot advanced MN dot com not sure that's a good idea

41:06.320 --> 41:09.320
me it's interesting

41:09.320 --> 41:13.760
Cuz I heard that a lot of the TVs, the analog signals are gonna be cut off pretty soon here

41:13.760 --> 41:17.200
where they're gonna be mandating where they have to make more HD TVs

41:17.200 --> 41:20.600
versus analog TVs. Let me read the second part of the quote though.

41:20.600 --> 41:24.560
With the technology being built into the revolution, we believe the games will

41:24.560 --> 41:26.240
look brilliant and play brilliantly.

41:26.240 --> 41:30.360
This can all be done without HD.

41:30.360 --> 41:35.040
Interesting. I think that their intentions are good as far as making it a more

41:35.040 --> 41:36.160
affordable system.

41:36.160 --> 41:39.520
because there are people who will just go out and buy the cheaper one

41:39.520 --> 41:42.720
you know and that will definitely help sales for them

41:42.720 --> 41:46.520
however with the way the market's behaving isn't that sort of the same nail

41:46.520 --> 41:47.720
that the Dreamcast put it

41:47.720 --> 41:52.160
in their coffin? Don't know, don't know. Microsoft it's very interesting, Microsoft and Sony are

41:52.160 --> 41:55.240
really whoring the HD thing, Microsoft is saying you must

41:55.240 --> 41:58.920
make your games HD compatible. Microsoft has not made

41:58.920 --> 42:02.560
a profit on the Xbox yet. You know what

42:02.560 --> 42:05.800
I'm smelling some tricks up

42:05.800 --> 42:11.720
Nintendo's sleeve man, they just blew it right out wide open there. Take it as you will. We'll see

42:12.280 --> 42:16.760
More to come I'm sure one last story tonight for you guys here

42:17.120 --> 42:21.340
And it has to do with Final Fantasy 11 because I know Loki's a big Final Fantasy 11 horror

42:21.860 --> 42:25.980
Also another one from Famitsu magazine who is feeding us with all these articles tonight

42:26.640 --> 42:29.200
Final Fantasy 11 producer Hiromichi

42:30.040 --> 42:32.040
Tanaka

42:32.040 --> 42:35.560
Disclosed that they are his team is currently working on a new

42:36.120 --> 42:37.240
MMO

42:37.240 --> 42:42.040
Specifically for next-generation consoles. Will it be a sequel to Final Fantasy 11?

42:42.040 --> 42:47.000
it's unknown at this time, but it will be specifically next-generation consoles and

42:47.440 --> 42:53.160
Finally, I have a brief really quick more summing up a few things television coming to the DS

42:53.160 --> 42:56.760
That looks cool two more that legit or is that a hack? No, it's legit

42:56.760 --> 42:57.260
Oh cool.

42:57.260 --> 43:05.260
Two more games also coming from Capcom to the PSP. Those would be Mega Man Legends and...

43:05.260 --> 43:09.260
God, I can't remember the other one. But anyways, Mega Man Legends is coming. That's the one I was happy about.

43:09.260 --> 43:12.260
And I think some role-playing game. Fire Emblem or something.

43:12.260 --> 43:19.260
Yes, yes. The new, actually the new Fire Emblem on GameCube is supposed to be really tremendous.

43:19.260 --> 43:24.260
Really good. And there's been just a jump up for it. Lots of people.

43:24.260 --> 43:26.260
To be continued on a later podcast.

43:26.260 --> 43:34.260
And anybody out there listening that's in the PlayStation Portable or DS, you know, home development community,

43:34.260 --> 43:40.260
please, please, please port ZZT or MegaZooks. Thank you.

43:40.260 --> 43:42.260
I agree. ZZT would be needed. Thank you.

43:42.260 --> 43:47.260
All right. That's going to do it for another podcast. Final thoughts. Loki.

43:47.260 --> 43:54.260
I hope I can beat WarioWare Twisted and I hope I can get my Grand Theft Auto San Andreas back because I need to play it.

43:54.260 --> 43:58.660
And I hope the PC version is done, uh, being purchased onto my computer.

43:58.660 --> 44:01.260
DarkSockRay, your final thought?

44:01.260 --> 44:11.260
As always, reject false icons, and my brand new 2002 Lancer OZ Rally completely kicks your ass.

44:11.260 --> 44:15.260
And my final thought is, beware eye hunger.

44:15.260 --> 44:20.260
Goodnight everybody, thank you for tuning in, and we'll see you next time on the Orange Lounge Radio To-Go Edition.

44:20.260 --> 44:25.620
That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

44:25.620 --> 44:32.500
