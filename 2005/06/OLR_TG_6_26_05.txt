Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of June 27th, 2005.
You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
Hello, everybody, once again, and welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, our 26th episode, if you can believe it.
Uh, the podcast dedicated to those video games that don't suck, and well, sometimes we do have to talk about some that do, but not very many.
We try to keep that to a minimum.
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
Join me as always, my awesome co-host, in this quarter, the happiest bunny on the farm, DarkSakura.
Jamie Summers.
You know, the ones that suck are the ones we make fun of.
Of course.
We have to bring them up so we can tease.
Bash them into a pulp of...
Broken silicon and wires and knotted plastic.
And then of course a reoccurring theme that's come up a lot lately are the games that are being turned into movies that we get to bash into a bloody pulp and all that stuff.
Don't get me started.
And I have another one to talk about tonight.
Joy!
Joy, Joy.
Also joining us, Techmaso, one and only Loki!
I am here.
How you doing?
I am here.
Alright.
Here we are.
He's there.
Yeah, he's there, you're here.
We're all here.
This is me in the corner.
In the person.
That's me in the spotlight.
Yeah, great.
Um, just a reminder, Horns Launch Radio To Go Edition is actually brought to you in MP3 Pro encoding, so if you don't like the way this sounds on your iPod, that's because iPods don't have the MP3 Pro thing.
I wish they did, but maybe they'll get that in the future.
Um, but if you listen to this on, like, Winamp or whatever, you can get a MP3 Pro codec and this show sounds even better.
You can hear us in full stereo and everything, it's great.
Anyway, just thought I'd throw that out there because I haven't talked about that in, like, oh, 25 weeks or so, so...
I played one quest on PSO and that was it.
I did the caves.
I did the caves.
How'd that go?
Well, this thing is how I have a full power mag at the time on the level 11 character.
I'm level 13 now.
I was just like, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die.
How's PSO going now that it went pay?
Is there a lot less people on there?
I haven't noticed.
I always play by myself or with people I know anyway.
It's PSO.
Same thing it always was.
We're supposed to have Ep 4, though.
I need to check that out.
I picked up Destroy All Humans.
You know, remembering that you also ran out and bought Alien Hamed, and you like these Invader Zim-ish, alien, taking over the world type games, doesn't surprise me one bit that you ran out and bought it.
Well, the only reason I bought Alien Hamed is because it reminded me of Contra and Metal Slug.
That's the only reason I bought that game.
But, no, Destroy All Humans was basically for the... It's the same reason I bought Dog's Life.
In fact, this game reminds me of a dog's life in a lot of aspects, except for the fact that you're an alien and the other one you're a dog.
This alien has the ability to throw stuff telekinetically, which just offers endless playability right there.
You can just pick up chickens, throw them into walls, pick up people, throw them against the ground.
Pick up a cow, throw it into the air.
Help me understand this game a little bit because I've seen the commercials and everything.
So I understand that you play as an alien who is destroying all humans.
Why?
Why?
Why are they killing all humans?
Why are they destroying all humans?
Okay.
Well, basically what happens is this race of aliens or whatever, they're from some distant planet.
And a long, long time ago when they destroyed the Martians or whatever, they got pissed off or whatever and came to Earth.
They found that it was very primitive and whatnot.
So they inject it.
Some of their DNA into the early humans.
And since their race has no ability to reproduce, they have to clone themselves.
And after a while, generations and generations, their clones have become inferior to what they used to be.
So now they've come back to Earth to extract this DNA from humans and at the same time just destroy the whole planet because, you know,
Destruction for no particular reason.
That's because that's what they do.
That's why they destroyed the Martians.
Sort of like Jamie driving in her new car.
Hey!
Just kidding.
You were in my car with me today and I didn't kill anybody while you were there.
Although you wanted to.
Stupid van!
The Movie Man.
um, there's, you've got the missions that you're supposed to be doing, but after you finish the mission, you're still in the level, so you can collect, like, what's left of, there's, like, um, these hidden, almost, like, um, they're, like, uh, probes or whatever you have to find, and then that unlocks some other stuff, and then you can also extract DNA from the people, and that you can use to upgrade your ship, upgrade your, you know, abilities and whatnot, um,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Oh yeah, definitely go play it.
There's not much in July, so it's a good game.
For everybody to play or for a certain audience?
Oh, it's for everyone.
Honestly, just go play it.
I mean, it's a lot of fun.
Even if you don't buy it, rent it.
It's great.
I'm done.
I got a call actually today from Dan while he was at work asking me if I wanted a black Labrador, a miniature Dachshund, or a Chihuahua.
You're getting a doggie?
I'm getting a Nintendog
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
The US ones, you can unlock the Japanese dogs.
And also, for example, if someone has the Chihuahua one, someone has the mini Dash Hound, and you, I guess, interact with the Chihuahua one, it unlocks the Chihuahua one on yours.
So we should all make sure we get different ones when we get the game.
Is there a Shih Tzu?
Yes, there is a Shih Tzu.
I have to get a Shih Tzu just so I can say, I have a Shih Tzu.
It's technically Shih Tzu.
I like Shih Tzu.
Yeah, pah.
I almost picked the Dachshund, but I like the Black Labs.
I'm still waiting for Nintendo.
Labrador Retriever, Chihuahua, and me, Dachshund.
Speaking of DS games, my gaming week, what I got to play this week was Bomberman DS, which I am...
Super Bomberman 2 on Super Nintendo
I do remember the old Super Nintendo.
There were like four of them on Super Nintendo.
Well, you had the multi-tap.
Well, if you're a Bomberman fan, this is pretty much classic Bomberman, but the very cool thing, I love what they did with this Bomberman DS is that you can play eight-person multiplayer, one cartridge.
None of this, everybody's got to have the cartridge to play the game, because the DS is wireless and everything, you just send the game over and eight people can play off one cartridge.
I think that's awesome.
And this is what else I love about the DS here in this game, is that
It's not touch at all.
It's using the two screen thing.
I think you can, like you can set the controls to use the touchscreen if you want, but I'm loving it now that the games aren't feeling the need to whore the touch thing
incessantly.
Like they're actually coming up with good games that use just the two screen feature and that's what Bomberman does because there's eight people.
Now you have eight corners because there's the two screens.
So it works out pretty well.
Graphic wise it's just what you expect from a Bomberman game.
Probably a little better than what you saw on Super Nintendo but you know it's Bomberman.
It's not going to revolutionize the graphic world.
And it's just, it's a fun, it's a very good handheld game because handheld games are supposed to be the quick and easy
I had my birthday.
On the 26th, I know, I don't want to talk about my age, but some of my friends got together and bought me a PSP, which was very cool, so I have a PSP now.
And of course, the very first thing I did with it, because I don't know if you guys were listening to this show a couple months ago, but I actually picked up a copy of Luminous before I had a PSP, and I just let my friend borrow it, because I'm like, you can't get a PSP and not get Luminous.
I will buy it for when I get a PSP.
Well, he still has my copy of Luminous, unfortunately, so I have nothing to play on my PSP right now.
So the very first thing I do with my PSP, I fired up the homebrew page on the internet and I downloaded some Nintendo emulator and some ROMs.
Dan's been going crazy with that.
Oh, it's awesome.
We've got a gigabyte memory card.
It's awesome.
So yeah, he's got something like 50 ROMs on it.
It kind of works out for Sony in the long run too because Nintendo's been selling some of these games for $20 a pop and now people can play them for free on their PSP, although...
It's one of those things that nobody's supposed to talk about, but this kind of thing has to be a selling point for the PSP.
For some people.
For me, it definitely sells it.
So, Loki, I'll let you start tonight.
I know you probably... I kind of spoiled it there.
We've got the no-swap trick there now for the emulators, but what else is new in the hack-and-crack scene?
Well, that was pretty much the news this week, was that the...
New Exploit was released on Wednesday, I believe, and it's basically not very different from the last Exploit.
You basically have two folders on one memory card, except one of them has a percent sign at the end of it, and you basically have your two sets of e-boot files, and it just runs off your memory card now.
No need to swap, just go.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
No, 152.
That's the Japanese one.
The U.S.
one's 152.
And guess what, folks?
But they're working on 151 and 152 already, and it's going to be a matter of time before that's not even an issue.
It's going to be like Trillion and AOL.
Like every time AOL patches their server so Trillion can't use it anymore, within two days Trillion has a workaround.
It's just going to be the same thing.
It's great.
So yeah, it's been major news, actually.
There's been some cool homebrew games coming out, you know, some Blackjack Casino stuff.
That's kind of neat.
Actually, another thing that was pretty interesting was...
Game Boy Advance Simulator for the PSP.
Full speed?
Runs pretty good.
It's limited to files that are under 8 megs.
The ROMs have to be under 8 megs.
The Nintendo one's not perfect.
The Nintendo one, I noticed, wouldn't play Life Force, which is one of my favorite Nintendo games, and it wouldn't play Gyruss.
So it's
It's not there.
It's not there.
Actually, Dan tried the Game Boy Advance one and it ran Fire Emblem like crap.
He said it ran it so slow that it was a torture to play it.
So you didn't bother with it.
I don't know.
Now that we're seeing that the things get this advanced, you've got to go, well, you know, if Sony is going to try and screw with people so that their firmware is going to be forced to upgrade, you really can't blame them because this could get ugly.
Well, it technically is money out of their pockets.
Yeah.
It's going to get ugly if this stuff gets too mainstream.
The other thing I was going to mention is the game coming out later on this year, the Summer Burnout Legends.
One of the unique things about it is it will be able to share a demo level with other people via download play type thing.
So that's kind of a first also for the PSP, which is kind of neat.
And I know that's already been built into it, and you'll be able to download games and whatnot, hopefully to your memory stick.
and so that'll be coming out with Burnout Legends and then also really there's some good games coming out I know Midnight Club 3 just got released so that's going to be coming out next week so you can pick that up and then a bunch of cool stuff coming out, MediEvil they're working on
So it's a good summer for PSP.
Very cool.
One quick question I just want to pose to you guys, and those of you that are listening at home as well, I'm kind of curious, with the news about the Nintendo emulation and everything, usually people say emulation is not a bad thing because you're only playing things that you can't buy in the store anymore, and that's kind of, that's like the justification, you've seen this.
Is this Nintendo emulation ethical considering that Nintendo is still trying to profit off some of these old titles through their GBA Classic series?
What do you think?
From a support standpoint, you know, it is not ethical, I believe.
Because technically...
All right, like example, they're re-releasing Zelda.
That's out.
But say that you have an emulator to play it.
That is however much, say $35, that Nintendo's not going to get.
Now say that this is you times about 100 other people.
That's $3,500 that Nintendo's not getting.
That means that any future game that comes out is going to jack the price because they have to make up for loss of sales on that.
I know that they figure this in when they set price points, but the thing is that the price is going to keep going up the more that this goes on.
Counterpoint?
Counterpoint is they shouldn't be trying to resell fucking the first game of Zelda in the first place.
I'm not going to pay $20 for a game that's been out for years now.
Why should I have to buy some stupid game to run on the Game Boy Advance?
I'm going to run a damn emulator and play it for free.
and that's my take on even their other stuff with the new Revolution.
Big whoop-a-dee-doo, there's new graphics.
Yeah, and this kind of leads into one story.
You know what?
I would rather play every release on my Game Boy Advance than play an emulator.
Technically, I could just plug in my Nintendo and play it all I want to.
It's kind of like, if I'm hearing you right, it's kind of like downloading MP3s from the internet and buying them off iTunes.
When you buy something off iTunes, you know you're going to get...
or another service, a comparable service.
When you use one of these services, you know you're going to get the highest quality file.
As opposed to when you try to use LimeWire, you're going to get fake files, crappy sounding ones, people trying to mess with you and stuff.
Is that kind of how it is with ROMs versus the real thing?
I'll pay for quality.
I'll pay for quality.
The one thing that I do support ROMs for is for games that have been heavily edited and games that are just not coming out over here.
Then I will run a translation patch on them and play them.
Like translated... Like Seiken Densetsu 3?
Seiken Densetsu 3, yeah.
Okay.
Like the first Fire Emblem on the Game Boy Advance.
They never brought that.
The one with Roy and Marth.
Never brought that out over here.
My thought is, you know, I owned the Zelda cartridge back in the day, so I feel justified in emulating it.
Now, granted, maybe I'm playing some other things I didn't necessarily own, but I don't know, I still feel like, you know, I'm buying enough of their new stuff, and usually if they...
Bring out Zelda Redone, or I'm trying to think of some of the other games that they've redone recently.
Maybe Metroid Zero, but that's a little loose because it wasn't exactly the first game.
I buy that stuff right up.
But if you think about it, you asked if it is ethical.
No, it is not ethical.
Is it logical?
Yes, it is.
Okay, fair enough.
But ethical?
No.
Nobody's perfect.
Your thoughts at home, welcomed to go at OrangeLoungeRadio.com If you want to send us an email, to go at OrangeLoungeRadio.com I think it's ethical because they're not putting Nintendo games in the new Animal Crossing DS.
It's damn ethical.
No, that's not ethical.
That's the difference between ethics and logic.
You are going from a logical standpoint and not an ethical standpoint.
And trust me, I took three semesters of philosophy, so I should know this.
Martha Stewart went to jail over this stuff.
I'm just kidding.
All right.
Let's move on.
It is not ethical.
Let's move on.
Let's move on.
All right.
Your thoughts, again, to go at orangelaunchradio.com.
To be continued, maybe.
Zelda DS, huh?
Or we will publicly break you on the air.
Zelda DS.
They are working on one.
And in an interview with Wired Magazine, the Legend of Zelda producer says that the Nintendo DS version of Zelda will be primarily controlled via the touchscreen and stylus.
To which I say... Sigh.
Exactly.
Now, I'm...
I can't judge till I see it because, you know, Castlevania DS has the stylus thing, but it's tasteful.
It's limited.
It's not overboard with it.
It makes sense.
So I'm hoping that... One word.
Okay, what?
Harumph.
Just... I don't know.
I'm a little scared.
I have to see more on this, but this news does kind of make me go...
Do they have to whore this out in every game?
Well, you know, they did build it into the system for a reason.
But isn't one of the other selling points supposed to be the two-screen?
That's like saying, God damn those Nintendo games and using the goddamn A button.
Why does every game have to use the A button?
It's there for a reason.
They use it.
Think about classic Zelda.
You would never have to hit the menu button again because you could always have your menu on the top screen.
That's all you need.
And that's being innovative with the DS.
Well, that's right.
They called it the DS, not the S. For Stylus?
Exactly.
Or the TM, Touch Me.
I don't know.
TMFM.
Touch Me, Feel Me!
TMI.
You know, we were talking about movies last week.
We were talking about all the movie games that are coming out.
And by the way, we got a correction.
The postal thing that's going to be directed by Uwe Boll, not really going to be directed by Uwe Boll.
Or it's
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
We've got another game that's going to be made into a movie.
We kind of knew about this one for a while.
American McGee's version of Alice.
You know, like Alice in Wonderland.
You could say it's Tim Burton meets Tarantino meets just a big bag of crack, basically.
That's how you could describe Alice, I guess.
I don't know.
And you have to have a really happy computer to run it.
A few years, when a game first came out, you did.
Now it's, most computers could probably handle it.
Well, they're making a movie out of it, and they have casted Sarah Michelle Gellar, the one and only Buffy.
You know what, woman needs to eat something, because in The Grudge, she was like bone thin, and she was really in good shape when she was on Buffy.
Mm-hmm.
You know, because she consistently had to exercise for the role.
And eat.
Directed by Marcus Nispel, who did the recent remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
I'm thinking maybe being pregnant will help her look better.
You know, less anorexic.
They really need to put Natalie Portman in this.
The first rumors I heard were that Natalie Portman would be in it.
And right now, after seeing... She would be better.
After seeing closer, Natalie Portman should just be in everything.
I think.
Natalie Portman's hot.
And she could at least be more gothy than...
And she's also highly intelligent.
Did she graduate Harvard?
But Sarah Michelle Gellar was Buffy, you guys.
Oh, well, in that case, let me just stop all the press.
Let's put her in every movie because, you know, she was Buffy.
No, no, no, no.
When she was on Buffy, she looked healthy.
I cannot stand seeing Sarah Michelle Gellar the way she looks now.
Except that I'm hoping being pregnant will encourage her to eat food and not look like a starved little crow.
Thank you for watching!
How to Deliver a Baby
Like in the postage mail?
Like if you're at Walmart.
Hey, my water broke!
That was Natalie Portman roll.
Remember that?
Sadly enough, it was.
Number one.
Time the uterine contractions.
For first-time mothers, when contractions are about 3-5 minutes apart and last 40-90 seconds, an increase in strength and frequency for at least an hour, the labor is most likely real and not false.
I just want to point out, all you 13-21 year old guys, which is the primary demographic listening to this show...
Keep that in mind.
Time your uterine contraction.
It's not trying to eat you.
Dear, shut up.
Have clean, dry towels, a clean shirt, or something similar on hand.
Number two.
As the baby moves out of the womb, its head, the biggest part of its body, will open the cervix so the rest of it can pass through.
Three.
When the baby is out of the mother, dry it off and keep it warm.
God, I'm having flashbacks to the Miracle of Life.
Shut up!
Shut up!
If necessary, clear any fluid out of the baby's mouth with your fingers.
Four, tie off the umbilical cord.
Take a piece of string, a shoelace works as well, and tie off the cord several inches from the baby.
Do not cut the umbilical cord.
Number five, get to a hospital.
But my ultimate piece of advice in regards to that?
Yes.
Freaking have your midwife follow you everywhere you go.
and don't go to Walmart.
Number six, get it to the black market ASAP because the value of babies goes down dramatically.
Just stop.
You're a horrible, horrible person.
Moving on.
Actually, I was going around passing this around to all my coworkers at work.
It was great.
Half of them were pregnant.
Let's continue on with the baby theme, but this is kind of a, this is just sick.
I really don't know how else to explain this, but this is one of those things that's going around on email, which kind of makes me question if it's even legit or not, but you know, it's running on a lot of the big gaming websites, so I'm thinking it's got to be legit, but in Korea, there's stories announced out there that there was a mother and father who went to an internet cafe, and they were playing World of Warcraft.
and when they returned home, they found their four-month-old daughter dead, basically, because they left the daughter alone.
Of course, the couple has been booked on criminal charges.
The couple's defense, by the way, we were thinking of playing for just an hour or two and returning home like usual, but the game took longer that day.
So they've done this before.
The infant was the couple's only child.
Thank God!
They just shot themselves in the ass for that.
They deserve it.
But no baby deserves it.
The baby doesn't.
The baby doesn't deserve it, but the parents sure as hell do.
They were like, I'd give my firstborn to make level 57 tonight.
Oopsie.
You can address those cards and letters to Loki at OrangeHunter.com.
I don't know.
Sadly enough, the story doesn't surprise me because there's idiots in the world.
In Korea, in the United States, in Bolivia, everywhere.
There needs to be a standardized test before they let you breed.
If that was in the United States, it'd be the baby was dead in the car because the windows rolled up.
Along with their dog.
No comment from Blizzard on that, by the way.
Well, it's not Blizzard's fault.
It's not their fault.
It's not their fault.
You can bet somebody there will be a parents' council out there in the world somewhere.
I'm going to say that World of Warcraft causes babies to die.
Tell me there won't be this parents' council for freedom of America, whatever, somewhere that will say, World of Warcraft kills babies.
I almost said World of Warcraft.
I honestly, I haven't spent serious time with World of Warcraft.
I can't judge it one way or the other, but Final Fantasy XI won't kill your babies.
It probably did kill some of these dogs somewhere.
PSO won't kill your babies, because you can play in windowed mode.
Tell me there will not be somebody, some parent's council will say, World of Warcraft kills babies and should be taken off store shelves.
It's poisoning our youth.
Dot, dot, dot.
I'm surprised people that, you know, never mind.
I'm not going to go there.
Yeah, good idea.
How many babies died on EverQuest?
Let's talk about something a little happier.
No one that plays EverQuest can have babies.
Let's talk about Neopets.
Ah!
Mine are dead.
Everybody loves Neopets, right?
I checked on mine and they're dead.
Do your Neopets die now?
I couldn't get to my pets.
I had a Neopet like five years ago, I think.
And now Iguana Girl has your Neopet.
She adopted my Neopet years ago.
You had a Neopet once, right?
I had four Neopets.
They're all dead.
What did you do?
Did you leave him alone while you went to play World of Warcraft?
Ah, no.
I just got bored with him because I couldn't access it from work anymore.
Is it just me or did Neopets slowly go downhill over the years?
Neopets went downhill since they got a video game and a collectible card game.
And then, you know, I remember walking by Claire's one day.
I didn't go in there, but I walked by it one day and they were selling Neopets stuff and I'm just like...
I'm glad I stopped playing it.
Is it limited to?
They're all the same to me.
One of those girly stores.
Stupid Spoiled Whores, whatever those stores are.
Do you remember Pogs?
Do you remember Neopets?
No.
Pogs and Neopets are in the same family.
Here it is.
Neopets may not be as far away as you think because MTV bought Neopets.
That's right.
MTV Networks, home of music television, bought Neopets.
So that means that Neopets are going to start sucking even more.
Or it will be something else.
Maybe they can bring a Neopets show to MTV so they can continue to not play music.
Just a thought.
I already hate MTV.
Do you want to get into why?
Except that they gave me really neat Gorillaz commercials, but apart from that...
We love you, Adam Curry!
We love you, Adam Curry!
Tell us how you really feel.
Okay, even more than being a big festering pile of dog poopy, they don't play music anymore, and the music they do play sucks.
Unless it's Gorillas or Blur, or Super Furry Animals.
They don't play Blur anymore.
They used to.
Well, not here in America.
Like, one song.
Anyway, moving on, moving on.
Another network, Kids WB.
Kids WB will be getting 26 episodes of Beautiful Joe, which will be coming onto the network in the fall.
Two new Vitaful Gojo games are on their way out, by the way.
So, honestly, does this surprise anyone that it's being made into a cartoon?
Not really.
I don't stay up on the animes, so correct me.
It is an anime.
It has been out for some time.
I downloaded the first couple episodes of this, like, last year.
And it's on crack.
And Kids WB is going to butcher it!
And it will no longer retain its coolness!
Now, now, now, Kids WB didn't butcher Pokemon.
Yeah, they did.
Yeah, they did.
Yeah, they did.
Oh, right, that's right.
Pokemon was always a butcher, though.
I used to watch it in Japanese, and then you didn't see what they did to Digimon.
I know, I can't believe Kids WB took out all the strobing that was in that show.
And they took out the boob scene.
It's the part where Kojiro, what was he in Digimon?
James, and I'm so ashamed I know that Are there any TV networks you do like?
I like sci-fi.
They play Stargate.
And the Food Network for Iron Chef.
And I like Court TV and the History Channel and Biography.
Okay, sorry.
I don't have a news story on any of those channels.
But I do have a news story about G4, Television for Gamers.
Yay!
We like G4.
G4ia has their nominees coming out for...
G4 has their nominees coming out for G4ia, which is going to be taking place live August... No, I'm sorry.
It's July 27th, but will be shown on August 9th.
So it's not really live.
It's one of those tape delay things, but whatever.
They're doing things a little differently this year.
Industry experts select the nominees.
The gamers get to vote on them.
I guess it's probably through their website or something.
So we get more... What was it?
Hmm.
Best Innovation, Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, Field of Magic XYXX, Katamari Damacy, Full Spectrum Warrior, and PsyOps The Mindgate Conspiracy
I like this.
PsyOps is a good game.
Why would Field of Magic get a nomination because it's a ripoff of WarioWare?
And Luminous doesn't?
I don't know.
Best Original Soundtrack, Katamari Damacy, Fable, World of Warcraft, Halo 2, God of War.
Now, granted, all those games actually had really good soundtracks.
I can't argue with that, especially Katamari Damacy.
Especially that one.
Dude.
For the types of games they were, I actually really enjoyed Fable's soundtrack as well.
There's another category for licensed soundtrack, which Luminous was in.
Halo's gonna win, you know.
Huh?
Halo's gonna win because everyone votes Halo no matter what.
They could be like, best breakfast cereal.
Halo can be a nominee up against Fruit Loops or something like that.
Halo.
That's not cereal.
Right in the Nintendo breakfast system.
Best original game.
PsyOps, The Mindgate Conspiracy, Full Spectrum Warrior, God of War, Katamari Damacy, and Psychonauts.
God of War, or Katamari Damashii.
Here it is, Game of the Year, Half-Life 2, Halo 2, World of Warcraft, God of War, Resident Evil 4, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
Katamari Damashii should be in there.
I disagree with the entire list.
The production values for God of War, you can't really top that.
Considering
The audience in mind and the gaming public as a general.
We play a certain niche of games.
Taking the gaming public as a general, I guess, this list doesn't surprise me at all.
This honestly seems like a fair representation.
Are these all experts?
We're like the lunchtime poll in Heathers.
If the world was going to explode tomorrow and you had $6 million today, what would you do with it?
I'd go buy me Halo 2.
I would have liked to have seen a niche title, a black horse candidate, if you will, like Katamari Damacy or Luminous or something.
But it didn't happen.
What can you say?
So check that out if you want to.
It's over on G4.
Guitar Hero, that's the new game coming out.
Harmonix is teaming up with Red Octane.
It looks like a cross between Karaoke Revolution and Guitar Freaks.
Some songs have been announced.
And you know how they kind of did cover songs in Karaoke Revolution?
Well, it's going to be the same deal.
They're going to do cover songs in Guitar Hero.
But the covers in Karaoke Revolution weren't bad.
I've definitely heard worse.
They weren't bad.
So this should be interesting, the Guitar Hero.
Here's some of the songs that are going to be in it.
Red Hot Chili Peppers with Higher Ground, Boston, More Than a Feelin', Mega Death, Symphony of Destruction, Donna's Take It Off, Jimi Hendrix, Spanish Castle Magic, ZZ Top, Sharp Dressed Man, Black Sabbath, Iron Man, White Zombie, Thundercat 65, Queen of the Stone Age, No One Knows, David Bowie, Ziggy Stardust,
The Ramones, I Want To Be Sedated, Franz Ferdinand, Take Me Out, Deep Purple, Smoke On The Water, Cream, Crossroads, Sum 41, Fat Lip.
You had me at David Bowie.
I love Ziggy Stardust.
I kind of like the direction they're going with this because it got a lot of classic guitar blended with the newer bands that are known for guitars.
It's just the style of play that makes me think of that Johnny Whatever on the Gizmondo.
A little bit.
You know what I love, and they should have put it in there, is aerodynamical.
Well, this is just partial.
It's just partial.
Daft Punk.
That has one hell of a guitar solo in it.
We'll see.
Somebody brought this up a little earlier in the show, but I just want to clarify.
The revolution, the Nintendo revolution, there was a report over on Joystick.com.
That's with a Q. Joystick.com is reporting that they will be getting a graphical upgrade.
Remember how...
They announced months ago that Nintendo and Super Nintendo titles all the way up through 64 titles will be downloadable through the revolution.
They're going to get a graphical upgrade of some sort.
Kid Icarus, The Sotelo View
which was, we didn't get it over here, but it was like a download system where you could, you could actually download the ROMs for it now, the upgraded Zelda for Satellaview.
There were a bunch of different games, but they were all downloadable.
You could play them for a time limit and then.
Okay, okay.
Now, I can't see them going back and re-skinning all their old games, so I don't think it's that, although maybe for some of them it will be, because, like we were saying earlier in the show, why would you pay to download this stuff when you can emulate it for free?
Well, maybe that's a big incentive.
To play Kid Icarus with really nice Super Nintendo or even better graphics, I'd pay for that.
I really would.
I just want a freaking sequel to that game, that's all.
Is that too much to ask?
I had to be asked what the code was for Kid Icarus, by the way.
Icarus Fights Medusa Angels Terror Danger Horror!
GamePal
and Game Pal, what it does is it allows you to rent a character in an online world.
So I think it might be a play on the term Game Fly because you know how that's a rental service.
Well, Game Pal, for just a $300 deposit and for $150 for the first month and $130 for each month after that, you can have your choice of up to 50 accounts, one of 50 accounts for 14 popular MMOs, Star Wars Galaxies, Ultima Online, EverQuest, City of Heroes,
But the trick is, is that when you're renting these characters, you're renting God characters.
You're renting the highest they go.
So, you know, maximum level, all the good gear.
What do you think?
Is this a practical idea or is it a big joke?
Pisses me off.
Like, for example, on Ragnarok, I put in, what, two and a half years into my character to get her to level 70-something.
And then it would just piss me off to see someone come in with a level 100 character right off the bat.
It's ridiculous.
That's interesting because they're renting these characters, not selling them.
They're renting them.
They should charge even more.
The prices are a little weird.
They should jack those prices even more.
Make them pay for that privilege.
Loki, I know you've openly admitted to you don't care.
Buy your money online.
Who cares?
I think it's stupid.
Who would pay that kind of money for that?
An idiot would.
Honestly, for that kind of money, you could be buying a lot of online currency and get your character maxed out anyways.
For that money, you could actually buy groceries for two weeks.
You can use that as a car payment.
Get a babysitter for your baby when you go out to play World of Warcraft.
You know, goddammit people, live in the real fucking world, okay?
Games are fine every now and again, but keep in mind that your money, you know, you should use it responsibly or else you're going to end up like one of those losers whose baby died.
You'll be a loser, not a winner.
But that doesn't mean that you shouldn't play your games at all.
Another World of Warcraft story I have for you guys.
They're getting an expansion pack.
And that's pretty much all I have to say.
There's really not a whole lot of news besides that.
They announced that they're making an expansion pack.
That's kind of the duh news of the week, you know.
Wow.
Let's see.
Over 2 million people.
You're a dork.
Over 2 million people on this MMO.
You think we might do an expansion or 12?
Yeah.
I'll stick with PSO, thank you, until Ragnarok 2 comes out I'm still curious about WoW I'm taking a break from MMOs in general right now I'm kind of burnt on them, but I think when I come back I will check out WoW I still think you should play PSO with me I'm on a break I will pay for you a month to play PSO with me We'll see I can't say anything against free stuff, we'll see Alright, one last story for you guys tonight You know Happy Tree Friends?
Yeah, these were the shorts they used to show at Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted where they had these cute lovable furry animals and they kill each other senseless.
They gouge out eyeballs and all this stuff.
So what more would be perfect for Happy Tree friends than for them to get their own video game?
It's happening.
Brad Young, chief executive of Flashman Studios, says it's an almost perfect brand for video games.
The simple, cute, and hugely appealing graphical style combined with a very dark, clever humor and the cartoon violence provides a wonderful opportunity for the video games market to tap into a huge global fan base.
Might I add, I hope this turns out better than Clay Fighters.
I liked Clay Fighters.
It was all about Helga.
I thought Clay Fighters was... It was one of those one-trick games.
No, it was all about... Who was this Mr. Frosty?
Dude, I love Clay Fighters.
How could you put down Clay Fighters?
I didn't like Clay Fighters because I had Street Fighter 2, which was much better.
So did I, and I had Clay Fighters.
It was all about C2.
Loki, you're awfully quiet, but you were the first one to show me a DVD full of these things.
I actually cringed at some of these cartoons.
It takes a lot to gross me out, but some of these are nasty.
It's just building off the popularity of Conker, Live and Reloaded.
I seem to recall that G4 was running these in some capacity too.
Yeah, they're running them on their Attack of the Show show that's on their network, and it's kind of like, ooh, look at us, we're hip and, yeah.
Well, they do, like, they show, like, popular clips on the web, and it doesn't surprise me so much.
It's just, you know.
Interesting.
Let's jump on board this now, you know, what, you know, how many years All aboard the sellout train, woo woo, you know we'd hop on it too, we would hop on it too How late are they, well, while we're at it, let's get a Strong Bad game, you know, hey, that'd be fun Hey, no, that would be fun I am surprised that hasn't happened already Imagine if you had, like, the whole Strong Bad RPG Hey, what do you think's the first website that's gonna become a movie?
First website to become a movie?
Yeah, first website.
Just as long as it's not Tub Girl or Goat Day.
What if it's DarkSakura.com?
Which is like not updated every year?
Nah.
What?
Oh, I thought you actually had an answer.
No, I didn't have an answer.
I was just throwing out a question.
Actually, funny enough, I looked up DarkSakura in Google Images to see what I could find, and the third picture was Shermie, my cat.
DarkSakura, all one word under Google Image Search
And so I was sitting there, you know, playing my game and all of a sudden I feel the ground under me roll.
I'm like, damn, this is a realistic game.
The first earthquake I ever felt, though, was in Alabama.
A tremor off the coast.
Not a state known for their earthquakes.
It was a tremor off the coast.
All right.
Your final thought, DarkSakura?
My final thought?
Reject false icons.
Because I said so.
And my final thought is I want candy, so I'm going to go get it right now.
I want candy.
I am.
Thank you guys very much.
Have a great week.
We'll see you next time on the Orange Lounge Radio to-go edition.
