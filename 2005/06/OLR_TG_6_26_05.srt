00:00:00,289 --> 00:00:02,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of June 27th, 2005.

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:14,354
[SPEAKER_01]: You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

3
00:00:14,634 --> 00:00:18,596
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

4
00:00:19,516 --> 00:00:28,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, everybody, once again, and welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, our 26th episode, if you can believe it.

5
00:00:29,649 --> 00:00:36,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the podcast dedicated to those video games that don't suck, and well, sometimes we do have to talk about some that do, but not very many.

6
00:00:36,892 --> 00:00:37,853
[SPEAKER_03]: We try to keep that to a minimum.

7
00:00:38,353 --> 00:00:40,254
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

8
00:00:40,594 --> 00:00:46,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Join me as always, my awesome co-host, in this quarter, the happiest bunny on the farm, DarkSakura.

9
00:00:46,197 --> 00:00:46,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:47,337 --> 00:00:49,258
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the ones that suck are the ones we make fun of.

11
00:00:49,698 --> 00:00:50,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.

12
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,380
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to bring them up so we can tease.

13
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Bash them into a pulp of...

14
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Broken silicon and wires and knotted plastic.

15
00:01:00,116 --> 00:01:07,948
[SPEAKER_03]: And then of course a reoccurring theme that's come up a lot lately are the games that are being turned into movies that we get to bash into a bloody pulp and all that stuff.

16
00:01:07,988 --> 00:01:08,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me started.

17
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:09,991
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have another one to talk about tonight.

18
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:10,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Joy!

19
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:11,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Joy, Joy.

20
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Also joining us, Techmaso, one and only Loki!

21
00:01:15,082 --> 00:01:15,563
[SPEAKER_03]: I am here.

22
00:01:16,223 --> 00:01:16,704
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing?

23
00:01:17,485 --> 00:01:17,925
[SPEAKER_03]: I am here.

24
00:01:18,265 --> 00:01:18,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

25
00:01:19,587 --> 00:01:20,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we are.

26
00:01:20,127 --> 00:01:20,588
[SPEAKER_03]: He's there.

27
00:01:20,828 --> 00:01:21,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he's there, you're here.

28
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:22,549
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all here.

29
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:23,570
[SPEAKER_03]: This is me in the corner.

30
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:24,531
[SPEAKER_03]: In the person.

31
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:25,912
[SPEAKER_03]: That's me in the spotlight.

32
00:01:26,093 --> 00:01:26,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, great.

33
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:38,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, just a reminder, Horns Launch Radio To Go Edition is actually brought to you in MP3 Pro encoding, so if you don't like the way this sounds on your iPod, that's because iPods don't have the MP3 Pro thing.

34
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,020
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish they did, but maybe they'll get that in the future.

35
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:46,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but if you listen to this on, like, Winamp or whatever, you can get a MP3 Pro codec and this show sounds even better.

36
00:01:47,302 --> 00:01:49,683
[SPEAKER_03]: You can hear us in full stereo and everything, it's great.

37
00:01:49,803 --> 00:01:52,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, just thought I'd throw that out there because I haven't talked about that in, like, oh, 25 weeks or so, so...

38
00:01:54,065 --> 00:01:55,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I played one quest on PSO and that was it.

39
00:01:55,025 --> 00:01:55,886
[SPEAKER_03]: I did the caves.

40
00:02:17,287 --> 00:02:18,088
[SPEAKER_05]: I did the caves.

41
00:02:18,508 --> 00:02:19,028
[SPEAKER_03]: How'd that go?

42
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:23,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this thing is how I have a full power mag at the time on the level 11 character.

43
00:02:24,412 --> 00:02:25,373
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm level 13 now.

44
00:02:26,253 --> 00:02:30,696
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just like, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die.

45
00:02:30,797 --> 00:02:32,898
[SPEAKER_03]: How's PSO going now that it went pay?

46
00:02:32,978 --> 00:02:34,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a lot less people on there?

47
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:35,920
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't noticed.

48
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,102
[SPEAKER_05]: I always play by myself or with people I know anyway.

49
00:02:39,062 --> 00:02:39,783
[SPEAKER_05]: It's PSO.

50
00:02:39,963 --> 00:02:40,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Same thing it always was.

51
00:02:41,324 --> 00:02:43,025
[SPEAKER_05]: We're supposed to have Ep 4, though.

52
00:02:43,045 --> 00:02:43,966
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to check that out.

53
00:02:45,003 --> 00:02:46,366
[SPEAKER_03]: I picked up Destroy All Humans.

54
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:08,128
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, remembering that you also ran out and bought Alien Hamed, and you like these Invader Zim-ish, alien, taking over the world type games, doesn't surprise me one bit that you ran out and bought it.

55
00:03:08,148 --> 00:03:12,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the only reason I bought Alien Hamed is because it reminded me of Contra and Metal Slug.

56
00:03:12,951 --> 00:03:14,272
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only reason I bought that game.

57
00:03:15,453 --> 00:03:21,537
[SPEAKER_02]: But, no, Destroy All Humans was basically for the... It's the same reason I bought Dog's Life.

58
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:31,204
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, this game reminds me of a dog's life in a lot of aspects, except for the fact that you're an alien and the other one you're a dog.

59
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:38,249
[SPEAKER_02]: This alien has the ability to throw stuff telekinetically, which just offers endless playability right there.

60
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:43,253
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just pick up chickens, throw them into walls, pick up people, throw them against the ground.

61
00:03:43,813 --> 00:03:45,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Pick up a cow, throw it into the air.

62
00:03:45,974 --> 00:03:48,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Help me understand this game a little bit because I've seen the commercials and everything.

63
00:03:48,515 --> 00:03:52,096
[SPEAKER_03]: So I understand that you play as an alien who is destroying all humans.

64
00:03:52,356 --> 00:03:52,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

65
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:53,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

66
00:03:53,156 --> 00:03:53,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are they killing all humans?

67
00:03:53,977 --> 00:03:54,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are they destroying all humans?

68
00:03:54,977 --> 00:03:55,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

69
00:03:55,437 --> 00:04:00,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, basically what happens is this race of aliens or whatever, they're from some distant planet.

70
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:07,702
[SPEAKER_02]: And a long, long time ago when they destroyed the Martians or whatever, they got pissed off or whatever and came to Earth.

71
00:04:07,722 --> 00:04:10,623
[SPEAKER_02]: They found that it was very primitive and whatnot.

72
00:04:10,663 --> 00:04:11,443
[SPEAKER_02]: So they inject it.

73
00:04:12,523 --> 00:04:14,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of their DNA into the early humans.

74
00:04:15,164 --> 00:04:21,666
[SPEAKER_02]: And since their race has no ability to reproduce, they have to clone themselves.

75
00:04:21,746 --> 00:04:29,088
[SPEAKER_02]: And after a while, generations and generations, their clones have become inferior to what they used to be.

76
00:04:29,148 --> 00:04:36,530
[SPEAKER_02]: So now they've come back to Earth to extract this DNA from humans and at the same time just destroy the whole planet because, you know,

77
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Destruction for no particular reason.

78
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,680
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because that's what they do.

79
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,961
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why they destroyed the Martians.

80
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of like Jamie driving in her new car.

81
00:04:43,842 --> 00:04:44,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey!

82
00:04:44,342 --> 00:04:44,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.

83
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:48,464
[SPEAKER_05]: You were in my car with me today and I didn't kill anybody while you were there.

84
00:04:48,624 --> 00:04:49,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Although you wanted to.

85
00:04:50,285 --> 00:04:50,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Stupid van!

86
00:04:52,384 --> 00:04:53,024
[SPEAKER_02]: The Movie Man.

87
00:05:16,938 --> 00:05:39,685
[SPEAKER_02]: um, there's, you've got the missions that you're supposed to be doing, but after you finish the mission, you're still in the level, so you can collect, like, what's left of, there's, like, um, these hidden, almost, like, um, they're, like, uh, probes or whatever you have to find, and then that unlocks some other stuff, and then you can also extract DNA from the people, and that you can use to upgrade your ship, upgrade your, you know, abilities and whatnot, um,

88
00:05:40,785 --> 00:05:41,506
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

89
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, definitely go play it.

90
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:06,031
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not much in July, so it's a good game.

91
00:06:06,211 --> 00:06:08,472
[SPEAKER_02]: For everybody to play or for a certain audience?

92
00:06:08,872 --> 00:06:09,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's for everyone.

93
00:06:10,372 --> 00:06:11,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, just go play it.

94
00:06:11,612 --> 00:06:12,513
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's a lot of fun.

95
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:13,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you don't buy it, rent it.

96
00:06:14,013 --> 00:06:14,453
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.

97
00:06:17,954 --> 00:06:18,234
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm done.

98
00:06:18,814 --> 00:06:26,997
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a call actually today from Dan while he was at work asking me if I wanted a black Labrador, a miniature Dachshund, or a Chihuahua.

99
00:06:27,737 --> 00:06:28,517
[SPEAKER_03]: You're getting a doggie?

100
00:06:29,005 --> 00:06:30,006
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm getting a Nintendog

101
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,460
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

102
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:16,833
[SPEAKER_02]: The US ones, you can unlock the Japanese dogs.

103
00:07:17,174 --> 00:07:26,382
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, for example, if someone has the Chihuahua one, someone has the mini Dash Hound, and you, I guess, interact with the Chihuahua one, it unlocks the Chihuahua one on yours.

104
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:28,644
[SPEAKER_03]: So we should all make sure we get different ones when we get the game.

105
00:07:29,024 --> 00:07:29,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a Shih Tzu?

106
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:32,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there is a Shih Tzu.

107
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:34,970
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to get a Shih Tzu just so I can say, I have a Shih Tzu.

108
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,992
[SPEAKER_05]: It's technically Shih Tzu.

109
00:07:37,212 --> 00:07:37,993
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Shih Tzu.

110
00:07:38,013 --> 00:07:39,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, pah.

111
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:45,473
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost picked the Dachshund, but I like the Black Labs.

112
00:07:46,714 --> 00:07:47,534
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still waiting for Nintendo.

113
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:50,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Labrador Retriever, Chihuahua, and me, Dachshund.

114
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:55,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of DS games, my gaming week, what I got to play this week was Bomberman DS, which I am...

115
00:07:56,161 --> 00:07:57,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Bomberman 2 on Super Nintendo

116
00:08:19,908 --> 00:08:21,009
[SPEAKER_03]: I do remember the old Super Nintendo.

117
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:22,169
[SPEAKER_03]: There were like four of them on Super Nintendo.

118
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:24,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you had the multi-tap.

119
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:35,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you're a Bomberman fan, this is pretty much classic Bomberman, but the very cool thing, I love what they did with this Bomberman DS is that you can play eight-person multiplayer, one cartridge.

120
00:08:36,595 --> 00:08:43,318
[SPEAKER_03]: None of this, everybody's got to have the cartridge to play the game, because the DS is wireless and everything, you just send the game over and eight people can play off one cartridge.

121
00:08:43,358 --> 00:08:44,039
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's awesome.

122
00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:48,981
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is what else I love about the DS here in this game, is that

123
00:08:49,423 --> 00:08:51,446
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not touch at all.

124
00:08:52,247 --> 00:08:53,729
[SPEAKER_03]: It's using the two screen thing.

125
00:08:53,769 --> 00:09:01,279
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you can, like you can set the controls to use the touchscreen if you want, but I'm loving it now that the games aren't feeling the need to whore the touch thing

126
00:09:02,102 --> 00:09:02,662
[SPEAKER_03]: incessantly.

127
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:08,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they're actually coming up with good games that use just the two screen feature and that's what Bomberman does because there's eight people.

128
00:09:08,784 --> 00:09:11,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you have eight corners because there's the two screens.

129
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:13,245
[SPEAKER_03]: So it works out pretty well.

130
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:16,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Graphic wise it's just what you expect from a Bomberman game.

131
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:20,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably a little better than what you saw on Super Nintendo but you know it's Bomberman.

132
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,228
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to revolutionize the graphic world.

133
00:09:22,988 --> 00:09:28,670
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just, it's a fun, it's a very good handheld game because handheld games are supposed to be the quick and easy

134
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:29,850
[SPEAKER_03]: I had my birthday.

135
00:09:47,061 --> 00:09:56,345
[SPEAKER_03]: On the 26th, I know, I don't want to talk about my age, but some of my friends got together and bought me a PSP, which was very cool, so I have a PSP now.

136
00:09:57,665 --> 00:10:09,590
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, the very first thing I did with it, because I don't know if you guys were listening to this show a couple months ago, but I actually picked up a copy of Luminous before I had a PSP, and I just let my friend borrow it, because I'm like, you can't get a PSP and not get Luminous.

137
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,270
[SPEAKER_03]: I will buy it for when I get a PSP.

138
00:10:12,451 --> 00:10:15,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he still has my copy of Luminous, unfortunately, so I have nothing to play on my PSP right now.

139
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:25,654
[SPEAKER_03]: So the very first thing I do with my PSP, I fired up the homebrew page on the internet and I downloaded some Nintendo emulator and some ROMs.

140
00:10:25,934 --> 00:10:27,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan's been going crazy with that.

141
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:28,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's awesome.

142
00:10:28,074 --> 00:10:29,334
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got a gigabyte memory card.

143
00:10:29,574 --> 00:10:30,015
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.

144
00:10:30,895 --> 00:10:33,055
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, he's got something like 50 ROMs on it.

145
00:10:33,255 --> 00:10:42,837
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of works out for Sony in the long run too because Nintendo's been selling some of these games for $20 a pop and now people can play them for free on their PSP, although...

146
00:10:43,331 --> 00:10:49,834
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of those things that nobody's supposed to talk about, but this kind of thing has to be a selling point for the PSP.

147
00:10:50,755 --> 00:10:51,355
[SPEAKER_03]: For some people.

148
00:10:51,955 --> 00:10:53,336
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, it definitely sells it.

149
00:10:54,056 --> 00:10:55,797
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Loki, I'll let you start tonight.

150
00:10:55,917 --> 00:10:58,158
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you probably... I kind of spoiled it there.

151
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:05,122
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got the no-swap trick there now for the emulators, but what else is new in the hack-and-crack scene?

152
00:11:05,362 --> 00:11:08,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that was pretty much the news this week, was that the...

153
00:11:09,488 --> 00:11:18,414
[SPEAKER_02]: New Exploit was released on Wednesday, I believe, and it's basically not very different from the last Exploit.

154
00:11:18,494 --> 00:11:33,364
[SPEAKER_02]: You basically have two folders on one memory card, except one of them has a percent sign at the end of it, and you basically have your two sets of e-boot files, and it just runs off your memory card now.

155
00:11:33,505 --> 00:11:35,466
[SPEAKER_02]: No need to swap, just go.

156
00:11:36,181 --> 00:11:37,142
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

157
00:11:53,251 --> 00:11:54,211
[SPEAKER_02]: No, 152.

158
00:11:54,691 --> 00:11:55,712
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the Japanese one.

159
00:11:56,932 --> 00:11:57,392
[SPEAKER_02]: The U.S.

160
00:11:57,412 --> 00:11:57,852
[SPEAKER_02]: one's 152.

161
00:11:58,132 --> 00:11:59,232
[SPEAKER_02]: And guess what, folks?

162
00:11:59,492 --> 00:12:06,094
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're working on 151 and 152 already, and it's going to be a matter of time before that's not even an issue.

163
00:12:06,314 --> 00:12:08,574
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be like Trillion and AOL.

164
00:12:08,634 --> 00:12:14,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Like every time AOL patches their server so Trillion can't use it anymore, within two days Trillion has a workaround.

165
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:16,096
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just going to be the same thing.

166
00:12:16,476 --> 00:12:16,896
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.

167
00:12:18,297 --> 00:12:21,859
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's been major news, actually.

168
00:12:22,099 --> 00:12:25,860
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been some cool homebrew games coming out, you know, some Blackjack Casino stuff.

169
00:12:26,001 --> 00:12:26,661
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of neat.

170
00:12:27,441 --> 00:12:30,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, another thing that was pretty interesting was...

171
00:12:32,302 --> 00:12:37,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Boy Advance Simulator for the PSP.

172
00:12:37,486 --> 00:12:37,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Full speed?

173
00:12:38,747 --> 00:12:39,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Runs pretty good.

174
00:12:40,128 --> 00:12:43,831
[SPEAKER_02]: It's limited to files that are under 8 megs.

175
00:12:44,852 --> 00:12:45,813
[SPEAKER_02]: The ROMs have to be under 8 megs.

176
00:12:45,893 --> 00:12:47,094
[SPEAKER_03]: The Nintendo one's not perfect.

177
00:12:47,114 --> 00:12:51,897
[SPEAKER_03]: The Nintendo one, I noticed, wouldn't play Life Force, which is one of my favorite Nintendo games, and it wouldn't play Gyruss.

178
00:12:52,077 --> 00:12:52,638
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's

179
00:12:53,214 --> 00:12:53,754
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not there.

180
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:54,074
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not there.

181
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:23,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, Dan tried the Game Boy Advance one and it ran Fire Emblem like crap.

182
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,442
[SPEAKER_00]: He said it ran it so slow that it was a torture to play it.

183
00:13:30,856 --> 00:13:31,797
[SPEAKER_03]: So you didn't bother with it.

184
00:13:32,258 --> 00:13:33,079
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

185
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:45,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that we're seeing that the things get this advanced, you've got to go, well, you know, if Sony is going to try and screw with people so that their firmware is going to be forced to upgrade, you really can't blame them because this could get ugly.

186
00:13:45,195 --> 00:13:47,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it technically is money out of their pockets.

187
00:13:47,338 --> 00:13:47,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

188
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,241
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to get ugly if this stuff gets too mainstream.

189
00:13:51,742 --> 00:13:56,846
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing I was going to mention is the game coming out later on this year, the Summer Burnout Legends.

190
00:13:57,026 --> 00:14:03,832
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the unique things about it is it will be able to share a demo level with other people via download play type thing.

191
00:14:04,953 --> 00:14:09,177
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of a first also for the PSP, which is kind of neat.

192
00:14:09,918 --> 00:14:16,163
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that's already been built into it, and you'll be able to download games and whatnot, hopefully to your memory stick.

193
00:14:16,969 --> 00:14:34,673
[SPEAKER_02]: and so that'll be coming out with Burnout Legends and then also really there's some good games coming out I know Midnight Club 3 just got released so that's going to be coming out next week so you can pick that up and then a bunch of cool stuff coming out, MediEvil they're working on

194
00:14:35,762 --> 00:14:37,403
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a good summer for PSP.

195
00:14:37,663 --> 00:14:38,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

196
00:14:38,604 --> 00:14:55,276
[SPEAKER_03]: One quick question I just want to pose to you guys, and those of you that are listening at home as well, I'm kind of curious, with the news about the Nintendo emulation and everything, usually people say emulation is not a bad thing because you're only playing things that you can't buy in the store anymore, and that's kind of, that's like the justification, you've seen this.

197
00:14:56,039 --> 00:15:03,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this Nintendo emulation ethical considering that Nintendo is still trying to profit off some of these old titles through their GBA Classic series?

198
00:15:04,007 --> 00:15:04,387
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?

199
00:15:04,967 --> 00:15:10,673
[SPEAKER_05]: From a support standpoint, you know, it is not ethical, I believe.

200
00:15:11,073 --> 00:15:11,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Because technically...

201
00:15:13,581 --> 00:15:18,522
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, like example, they're re-releasing Zelda.

202
00:15:18,562 --> 00:15:19,042
[SPEAKER_05]: That's out.

203
00:15:19,462 --> 00:15:21,563
[SPEAKER_05]: But say that you have an emulator to play it.

204
00:15:22,023 --> 00:15:26,524
[SPEAKER_05]: That is however much, say $35, that Nintendo's not going to get.

205
00:15:26,684 --> 00:15:30,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Now say that this is you times about 100 other people.

206
00:15:30,525 --> 00:15:32,986
[SPEAKER_05]: That's $3,500 that Nintendo's not getting.

207
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:40,113
[SPEAKER_05]: That means that any future game that comes out is going to jack the price because they have to make up for loss of sales on that.

208
00:15:40,153 --> 00:15:47,778
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that they figure this in when they set price points, but the thing is that the price is going to keep going up the more that this goes on.

209
00:15:49,244 --> 00:15:49,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Counterpoint?

210
00:15:50,266 --> 00:15:55,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Counterpoint is they shouldn't be trying to resell fucking the first game of Zelda in the first place.

211
00:15:55,353 --> 00:15:59,099
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to pay $20 for a game that's been out for years now.

212
00:15:59,419 --> 00:16:02,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Why should I have to buy some stupid game to run on the Game Boy Advance?

213
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to run a damn emulator and play it for free.

214
00:16:05,302 --> 00:16:09,325
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's my take on even their other stuff with the new Revolution.

215
00:16:09,445 --> 00:16:11,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Big whoop-a-dee-doo, there's new graphics.

216
00:16:11,867 --> 00:16:13,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and this kind of leads into one story.

217
00:16:13,828 --> 00:16:14,269
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

218
00:16:14,369 --> 00:16:19,012
[SPEAKER_05]: I would rather play every release on my Game Boy Advance than play an emulator.

219
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:23,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Technically, I could just plug in my Nintendo and play it all I want to.

220
00:16:24,036 --> 00:16:29,840
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like, if I'm hearing you right, it's kind of like downloading MP3s from the internet and buying them off iTunes.

221
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,941
[SPEAKER_03]: When you buy something off iTunes, you know you're going to get...

222
00:16:33,703 --> 00:16:35,264
[SPEAKER_03]: or another service, a comparable service.

223
00:16:35,324 --> 00:16:43,310
[SPEAKER_03]: When you use one of these services, you know you're going to get the highest quality file.

224
00:16:44,891 --> 00:16:51,556
[SPEAKER_03]: As opposed to when you try to use LimeWire, you're going to get fake files, crappy sounding ones, people trying to mess with you and stuff.

225
00:16:52,191 --> 00:16:54,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that kind of how it is with ROMs versus the real thing?

226
00:16:54,433 --> 00:16:55,313
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll pay for quality.

227
00:16:55,774 --> 00:16:56,554
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll pay for quality.

228
00:16:56,574 --> 00:17:05,821
[SPEAKER_05]: The one thing that I do support ROMs for is for games that have been heavily edited and games that are just not coming out over here.

229
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:08,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I will run a translation patch on them and play them.

230
00:17:08,202 --> 00:17:10,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Like translated... Like Seiken Densetsu 3?

231
00:17:10,444 --> 00:17:11,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Seiken Densetsu 3, yeah.

232
00:17:11,345 --> 00:17:11,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

233
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:15,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the first Fire Emblem on the Game Boy Advance.

234
00:17:15,628 --> 00:17:16,228
[SPEAKER_05]: They never brought that.

235
00:17:16,288 --> 00:17:17,249
[SPEAKER_05]: The one with Roy and Marth.

236
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:18,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Never brought that out over here.

237
00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:26,695
[SPEAKER_03]: My thought is, you know, I owned the Zelda cartridge back in the day, so I feel justified in emulating it.

238
00:17:26,715 --> 00:17:35,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, granted, maybe I'm playing some other things I didn't necessarily own, but I don't know, I still feel like, you know, I'm buying enough of their new stuff, and usually if they...

239
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:43,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring out Zelda Redone, or I'm trying to think of some of the other games that they've redone recently.

240
00:17:44,224 --> 00:17:47,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe Metroid Zero, but that's a little loose because it wasn't exactly the first game.

241
00:17:47,445 --> 00:17:48,726
[SPEAKER_03]: I buy that stuff right up.

242
00:17:48,946 --> 00:17:51,127
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you think about it, you asked if it is ethical.

243
00:17:51,447 --> 00:17:52,788
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it is not ethical.

244
00:17:54,048 --> 00:17:55,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it logical?

245
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:56,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it is.

246
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:57,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, fair enough.

247
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,130
[SPEAKER_03]: But ethical?

248
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:58,590
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

249
00:17:58,910 --> 00:17:59,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody's perfect.

250
00:18:00,498 --> 00:18:10,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Your thoughts at home, welcomed to go at OrangeLoungeRadio.com If you want to send us an email, to go at OrangeLoungeRadio.com I think it's ethical because they're not putting Nintendo games in the new Animal Crossing DS.

251
00:18:11,773 --> 00:18:12,635
[SPEAKER_02]: It's damn ethical.

252
00:18:13,035 --> 00:18:14,016
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's not ethical.

253
00:18:14,036 --> 00:18:15,619
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the difference between ethics and logic.

254
00:18:17,082 --> 00:18:19,864
[SPEAKER_05]: You are going from a logical standpoint and not an ethical standpoint.

255
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:23,606
[SPEAKER_05]: And trust me, I took three semesters of philosophy, so I should know this.

256
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Martha Stewart went to jail over this stuff.

257
00:18:26,088 --> 00:18:26,528
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.

258
00:18:26,568 --> 00:18:26,849
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

259
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:27,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on.

260
00:18:27,629 --> 00:18:28,450
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not ethical.

261
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on.

262
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:29,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on.

263
00:18:29,811 --> 00:18:30,071
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

264
00:18:30,111 --> 00:18:32,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Your thoughts, again, to go at orangelaunchradio.com.

265
00:18:32,372 --> 00:18:33,173
[SPEAKER_03]: To be continued, maybe.

266
00:18:34,733 --> 00:18:36,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Zelda DS, huh?

267
00:18:36,274 --> 00:18:37,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Or we will publicly break you on the air.

268
00:18:38,654 --> 00:18:39,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Zelda DS.

269
00:18:39,755 --> 00:18:41,135
[SPEAKER_03]: They are working on one.

270
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:51,158
[SPEAKER_03]: And in an interview with Wired Magazine, the Legend of Zelda producer says that the Nintendo DS version of Zelda will be primarily controlled via the touchscreen and stylus.

271
00:18:51,638 --> 00:18:55,339
[SPEAKER_03]: To which I say... Sigh.

272
00:18:55,379 --> 00:18:55,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

273
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:57,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I'm...

274
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:04,902
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't judge till I see it because, you know, Castlevania DS has the stylus thing, but it's tasteful.

275
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:06,183
[SPEAKER_03]: It's limited.

276
00:19:06,724 --> 00:19:08,425
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not overboard with it.

277
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:09,386
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes sense.

278
00:19:09,686 --> 00:19:13,168
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm hoping that... One word.

279
00:19:13,348 --> 00:19:13,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, what?

280
00:19:14,129 --> 00:19:14,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Harumph.

281
00:19:16,931 --> 00:19:18,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Just... I don't know.

282
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,233
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a little scared.

283
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:22,635
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to see more on this, but this news does kind of make me go...

284
00:19:23,803 --> 00:19:25,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they have to whore this out in every game?

285
00:19:26,245 --> 00:19:29,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, they did build it into the system for a reason.

286
00:19:30,488 --> 00:19:33,610
[SPEAKER_02]: But isn't one of the other selling points supposed to be the two-screen?

287
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:37,053
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like saying, God damn those Nintendo games and using the goddamn A button.

288
00:19:37,133 --> 00:19:38,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Why does every game have to use the A button?

289
00:19:39,795 --> 00:19:40,716
[SPEAKER_02]: It's there for a reason.

290
00:19:40,736 --> 00:19:41,256
[SPEAKER_02]: They use it.

291
00:19:41,456 --> 00:19:42,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about classic Zelda.

292
00:19:42,717 --> 00:19:47,361
[SPEAKER_03]: You would never have to hit the menu button again because you could always have your menu on the top screen.

293
00:19:47,861 --> 00:19:48,602
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all you need.

294
00:19:48,902 --> 00:19:50,323
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's being innovative with the DS.

295
00:19:50,563 --> 00:19:51,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's right.

296
00:19:51,163 --> 00:19:54,245
[SPEAKER_05]: They called it the DS, not the S. For Stylus?

297
00:19:54,605 --> 00:19:54,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

298
00:19:55,045 --> 00:19:57,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the TM, Touch Me.

299
00:19:57,366 --> 00:19:57,686
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

300
00:19:59,227 --> 00:19:59,967
[SPEAKER_05]: TMFM.

301
00:20:00,487 --> 00:20:01,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Touch Me, Feel Me!

302
00:20:02,648 --> 00:20:03,208
[SPEAKER_03]: TMI.

303
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:06,149
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we were talking about movies last week.

304
00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:07,770
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking about all the movie games that are coming out.

305
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,411
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, we got a correction.

306
00:20:09,471 --> 00:20:14,333
[SPEAKER_03]: The postal thing that's going to be directed by Uwe Boll, not really going to be directed by Uwe Boll.

307
00:20:14,353 --> 00:20:14,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Or it's

308
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,661
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

309
00:20:32,538 --> 00:20:34,920
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got another game that's going to be made into a movie.

310
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,301
[SPEAKER_03]: We kind of knew about this one for a while.

311
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:39,004
[SPEAKER_03]: American McGee's version of Alice.

312
00:20:39,084 --> 00:20:40,565
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like Alice in Wonderland.

313
00:20:41,566 --> 00:20:45,830
[SPEAKER_03]: You could say it's Tim Burton meets Tarantino meets just a big bag of crack, basically.

314
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,471
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how you could describe Alice, I guess.

315
00:20:47,511 --> 00:20:47,812
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

316
00:20:48,292 --> 00:20:51,455
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have to have a really happy computer to run it.

317
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:55,025
[SPEAKER_03]: A few years, when a game first came out, you did.

318
00:20:55,085 --> 00:20:57,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's, most computers could probably handle it.

319
00:20:57,767 --> 00:21:02,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're making a movie out of it, and they have casted Sarah Michelle Gellar, the one and only Buffy.

320
00:21:02,732 --> 00:21:13,121
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, woman needs to eat something, because in The Grudge, she was like bone thin, and she was really in good shape when she was on Buffy.

321
00:21:13,722 --> 00:21:13,882
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.

322
00:21:15,069 --> 00:21:18,111
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, because she consistently had to exercise for the role.

323
00:21:18,732 --> 00:21:19,132
[SPEAKER_05]: And eat.

324
00:21:19,572 --> 00:21:24,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Directed by Marcus Nispel, who did the recent remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

325
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:27,057
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking maybe being pregnant will help her look better.

326
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:28,899
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, less anorexic.

327
00:21:28,999 --> 00:21:31,360
[SPEAKER_03]: They really need to put Natalie Portman in this.

328
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,642
[SPEAKER_03]: The first rumors I heard were that Natalie Portman would be in it.

329
00:21:33,742 --> 00:21:35,303
[SPEAKER_03]: And right now, after seeing... She would be better.

330
00:21:35,423 --> 00:21:37,484
[SPEAKER_03]: After seeing closer, Natalie Portman should just be in everything.

331
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:39,586
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.

332
00:21:39,846 --> 00:21:40,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Natalie Portman's hot.

333
00:21:40,847 --> 00:21:43,949
[SPEAKER_02]: And she could at least be more gothy than...

334
00:21:45,491 --> 00:21:47,012
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's also highly intelligent.

335
00:21:47,052 --> 00:21:48,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Did she graduate Harvard?

336
00:21:48,133 --> 00:21:50,274
[SPEAKER_03]: But Sarah Michelle Gellar was Buffy, you guys.

337
00:21:51,354 --> 00:21:54,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, in that case, let me just stop all the press.

338
00:21:54,216 --> 00:21:56,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's put her in every movie because, you know, she was Buffy.

339
00:21:56,417 --> 00:21:58,058
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no.

340
00:21:58,699 --> 00:22:00,500
[SPEAKER_05]: When she was on Buffy, she looked healthy.

341
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,902
[SPEAKER_05]: I cannot stand seeing Sarah Michelle Gellar the way she looks now.

342
00:22:05,562 --> 00:22:11,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Except that I'm hoping being pregnant will encourage her to eat food and not look like a starved little crow.

343
00:22:12,006 --> 00:22:12,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

344
00:22:30,513 --> 00:22:32,334
[SPEAKER_03]: How to Deliver a Baby

345
00:22:58,049 --> 00:22:59,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in the postage mail?

346
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:00,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if you're at Walmart.

347
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:04,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, my water broke!

348
00:23:04,693 --> 00:23:06,053
[SPEAKER_03]: That was Natalie Portman roll.

349
00:23:06,173 --> 00:23:06,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that?

350
00:23:07,674 --> 00:23:08,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Sadly enough, it was.

351
00:23:10,076 --> 00:23:10,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Number one.

352
00:23:11,468 --> 00:23:12,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Time the uterine contractions.

353
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:24,538
[SPEAKER_05]: For first-time mothers, when contractions are about 3-5 minutes apart and last 40-90 seconds, an increase in strength and frequency for at least an hour, the labor is most likely real and not false.

354
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:30,083
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to point out, all you 13-21 year old guys, which is the primary demographic listening to this show...

355
00:23:30,863 --> 00:23:31,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep that in mind.

356
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Time your uterine contraction.

357
00:23:33,865 --> 00:23:35,186
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not trying to eat you.

358
00:23:35,366 --> 00:23:36,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear, shut up.

359
00:23:37,567 --> 00:23:41,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Have clean, dry towels, a clean shirt, or something similar on hand.

360
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two.

361
00:23:43,751 --> 00:23:49,754
[SPEAKER_05]: As the baby moves out of the womb, its head, the biggest part of its body, will open the cervix so the rest of it can pass through.

362
00:23:50,775 --> 00:23:51,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Three.

363
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:54,577
[SPEAKER_05]: When the baby is out of the mother, dry it off and keep it warm.

364
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:57,064
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I'm having flashbacks to the Miracle of Life.

365
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:57,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up!

366
00:23:57,504 --> 00:23:57,944
Shut up!

367
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:02,565
[SPEAKER_05]: If necessary, clear any fluid out of the baby's mouth with your fingers.

368
00:24:03,746 --> 00:24:05,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Four, tie off the umbilical cord.

369
00:24:06,046 --> 00:24:10,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Take a piece of string, a shoelace works as well, and tie off the cord several inches from the baby.

370
00:24:10,848 --> 00:24:12,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not cut the umbilical cord.

371
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:14,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Number five, get to a hospital.

372
00:24:14,889 --> 00:24:17,230
[SPEAKER_05]: But my ultimate piece of advice in regards to that?

373
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:17,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

374
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Freaking have your midwife follow you everywhere you go.

375
00:24:21,547 --> 00:24:22,468
[SPEAKER_02]: and don't go to Walmart.

376
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:28,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Number six, get it to the black market ASAP because the value of babies goes down dramatically.

377
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:29,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Just stop.

378
00:24:29,913 --> 00:24:33,936
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a horrible, horrible person.

379
00:24:34,116 --> 00:24:34,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

380
00:24:34,776 --> 00:24:37,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I was going around passing this around to all my coworkers at work.

381
00:24:37,638 --> 00:24:38,819
[SPEAKER_05]: It was great.

382
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:39,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Half of them were pregnant.

383
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's continue on with the baby theme, but this is kind of a, this is just sick.

384
00:24:45,124 --> 00:25:08,343
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't know how else to explain this, but this is one of those things that's going around on email, which kind of makes me question if it's even legit or not, but you know, it's running on a lot of the big gaming websites, so I'm thinking it's got to be legit, but in Korea, there's stories announced out there that there was a mother and father who went to an internet cafe, and they were playing World of Warcraft.

385
00:25:09,023 --> 00:25:16,527
[SPEAKER_03]: and when they returned home, they found their four-month-old daughter dead, basically, because they left the daughter alone.

386
00:25:18,227 --> 00:25:20,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, the couple has been booked on criminal charges.

387
00:25:21,089 --> 00:25:29,653
[SPEAKER_03]: The couple's defense, by the way, we were thinking of playing for just an hour or two and returning home like usual, but the game took longer that day.

388
00:25:30,753 --> 00:25:31,974
[SPEAKER_05]: So they've done this before.

389
00:25:33,534 --> 00:25:35,475
[SPEAKER_03]: The infant was the couple's only child.

390
00:25:36,096 --> 00:25:36,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank God!

391
00:25:37,921 --> 00:25:39,802
[SPEAKER_05]: They just shot themselves in the ass for that.

392
00:25:39,822 --> 00:25:43,264
[SPEAKER_05]: They deserve it.

393
00:25:44,444 --> 00:25:45,865
[SPEAKER_03]: But no baby deserves it.

394
00:25:45,885 --> 00:25:46,446
[SPEAKER_02]: The baby doesn't.

395
00:25:46,466 --> 00:25:48,587
[SPEAKER_05]: The baby doesn't deserve it, but the parents sure as hell do.

396
00:25:50,328 --> 00:25:53,849
[SPEAKER_02]: They were like, I'd give my firstborn to make level 57 tonight.

397
00:25:53,869 --> 00:25:56,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Oopsie.

398
00:25:56,911 --> 00:26:02,274
[SPEAKER_03]: You can address those cards and letters to Loki at OrangeHunter.com.

399
00:26:05,413 --> 00:26:06,694
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

400
00:26:06,814 --> 00:26:11,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Sadly enough, the story doesn't surprise me because there's idiots in the world.

401
00:26:11,497 --> 00:26:16,961
[SPEAKER_03]: In Korea, in the United States, in Bolivia, everywhere.

402
00:26:17,722 --> 00:26:20,644
[SPEAKER_05]: There needs to be a standardized test before they let you breed.

403
00:26:20,864 --> 00:26:25,508
[SPEAKER_02]: If that was in the United States, it'd be the baby was dead in the car because the windows rolled up.

404
00:26:26,328 --> 00:26:27,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Along with their dog.

405
00:26:30,737 --> 00:26:32,518
[SPEAKER_03]: No comment from Blizzard on that, by the way.

406
00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:34,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's not Blizzard's fault.

407
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:35,660
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not their fault.

408
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,401
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not their fault.

409
00:26:36,641 --> 00:26:41,264
[SPEAKER_03]: You can bet somebody there will be a parents' council out there in the world somewhere.

410
00:26:41,344 --> 00:26:45,447
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to say that World of Warcraft causes babies to die.

411
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:54,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me there won't be this parents' council for freedom of America, whatever, somewhere that will say, World of Warcraft kills babies.

412
00:26:54,073 --> 00:26:55,954
[SPEAKER_03]: I almost said World of Warcraft.

413
00:26:57,999 --> 00:27:00,581
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly, I haven't spent serious time with World of Warcraft.

414
00:27:00,601 --> 00:27:03,722
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't judge it one way or the other, but Final Fantasy XI won't kill your babies.

415
00:27:04,383 --> 00:27:06,023
[SPEAKER_03]: It probably did kill some of these dogs somewhere.

416
00:27:06,043 --> 00:27:08,885
[SPEAKER_05]: PSO won't kill your babies, because you can play in windowed mode.

417
00:27:08,905 --> 00:27:15,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me there will not be somebody, some parent's council will say, World of Warcraft kills babies and should be taken off store shelves.

418
00:27:15,829 --> 00:27:16,769
[SPEAKER_03]: It's poisoning our youth.

419
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:18,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Dot, dot, dot.

420
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:23,453
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised people that, you know, never mind.

421
00:27:24,363 --> 00:27:25,163
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to go there.

422
00:27:25,183 --> 00:27:25,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, good idea.

423
00:27:26,004 --> 00:27:27,765
[SPEAKER_03]: How many babies died on EverQuest?

424
00:27:27,825 --> 00:27:29,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about something a little happier.

425
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:30,986
[SPEAKER_02]: No one that plays EverQuest can have babies.

426
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:33,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about Neopets.

427
00:27:34,648 --> 00:27:34,768
Ah!

428
00:27:35,148 --> 00:27:35,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine are dead.

429
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:37,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody loves Neopets, right?

430
00:27:37,549 --> 00:27:38,989
[SPEAKER_03]: I checked on mine and they're dead.

431
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Do your Neopets die now?

432
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:42,071
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't get to my pets.

433
00:27:42,331 --> 00:27:44,872
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a Neopet like five years ago, I think.

434
00:27:44,992 --> 00:27:47,113
[SPEAKER_05]: And now Iguana Girl has your Neopet.

435
00:27:47,293 --> 00:27:49,654
[SPEAKER_03]: She adopted my Neopet years ago.

436
00:27:50,254 --> 00:27:51,315
[SPEAKER_03]: You had a Neopet once, right?

437
00:27:51,335 --> 00:27:52,075
[SPEAKER_05]: I had four Neopets.

438
00:27:53,036 --> 00:27:53,656
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all dead.

439
00:27:54,941 --> 00:27:55,362
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you do?

440
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you leave him alone while you went to play World of Warcraft?

441
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:58,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, no.

442
00:27:58,485 --> 00:28:01,868
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got bored with him because I couldn't access it from work anymore.

443
00:28:01,968 --> 00:28:04,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it just me or did Neopets slowly go downhill over the years?

444
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:09,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Neopets went downhill since they got a video game and a collectible card game.

445
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:13,219
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, I remember walking by Claire's one day.

446
00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:17,103
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't go in there, but I walked by it one day and they were selling Neopets stuff and I'm just like...

447
00:28:18,144 --> 00:28:19,405
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad I stopped playing it.

448
00:28:19,425 --> 00:28:20,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it limited to?

449
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:21,647
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all the same to me.

450
00:28:21,687 --> 00:28:22,708
[SPEAKER_03]: One of those girly stores.

451
00:28:22,728 --> 00:28:24,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Stupid Spoiled Whores, whatever those stores are.

452
00:28:24,229 --> 00:28:25,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember Pogs?

453
00:28:26,832 --> 00:28:27,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember Neopets?

454
00:28:28,153 --> 00:28:28,453
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

455
00:28:30,134 --> 00:28:32,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Pogs and Neopets are in the same family.

456
00:28:32,416 --> 00:28:32,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is.

457
00:28:32,957 --> 00:28:38,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Neopets may not be as far away as you think because MTV bought Neopets.

458
00:28:38,522 --> 00:28:38,842
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

459
00:28:38,982 --> 00:28:44,567
[SPEAKER_03]: MTV Networks, home of music television, bought Neopets.

460
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:48,381
[SPEAKER_05]: So that means that Neopets are going to start sucking even more.

461
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:51,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Or it will be something else.

462
00:28:51,982 --> 00:28:55,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they can bring a Neopets show to MTV so they can continue to not play music.

463
00:28:57,864 --> 00:28:58,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a thought.

464
00:28:58,364 --> 00:28:59,804
[SPEAKER_05]: I already hate MTV.

465
00:29:02,585 --> 00:29:03,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to get into why?

466
00:29:04,386 --> 00:29:07,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Except that they gave me really neat Gorillaz commercials, but apart from that...

467
00:29:09,172 --> 00:29:09,752
[SPEAKER_03]: We love you, Adam Curry!

468
00:29:09,772 --> 00:29:10,532
[SPEAKER_03]: We love you, Adam Curry!

469
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:35,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us how you really feel.

470
00:29:36,431 --> 00:29:42,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, even more than being a big festering pile of dog poopy, they don't play music anymore, and the music they do play sucks.

471
00:29:43,335 --> 00:29:46,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless it's Gorillas or Blur, or Super Furry Animals.

472
00:29:46,437 --> 00:29:47,798
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't play Blur anymore.

473
00:29:47,818 --> 00:29:48,239
[SPEAKER_03]: They used to.

474
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:49,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not here in America.

475
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, one song.

476
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, moving on, moving on.

477
00:29:52,621 --> 00:29:54,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Another network, Kids WB.

478
00:29:55,363 --> 00:30:03,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Kids WB will be getting 26 episodes of Beautiful Joe, which will be coming onto the network in the fall.

479
00:30:03,826 --> 00:30:06,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Two new Vitaful Gojo games are on their way out, by the way.

480
00:30:06,268 --> 00:30:10,031
[SPEAKER_03]: So, honestly, does this surprise anyone that it's being made into a cartoon?

481
00:30:10,051 --> 00:30:13,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really.

482
00:30:13,134 --> 00:30:16,196
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't stay up on the animes, so correct me.

483
00:30:16,277 --> 00:30:17,137
[SPEAKER_05]: It is an anime.

484
00:30:17,257 --> 00:30:18,639
[SPEAKER_05]: It has been out for some time.

485
00:30:19,219 --> 00:30:22,362
[SPEAKER_05]: I downloaded the first couple episodes of this, like, last year.

486
00:30:23,483 --> 00:30:24,964
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's on crack.

487
00:30:25,624 --> 00:30:28,307
[SPEAKER_05]: And Kids WB is going to butcher it!

488
00:30:28,847 --> 00:30:30,729
[SPEAKER_05]: And it will no longer retain its coolness!

489
00:30:31,533 --> 00:30:33,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, now, now, Kids WB didn't butcher Pokemon.

490
00:30:34,315 --> 00:30:35,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they did.

491
00:30:35,956 --> 00:30:36,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they did.

492
00:30:36,637 --> 00:30:37,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they did.

493
00:30:37,637 --> 00:30:38,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, right, that's right.

494
00:30:39,078 --> 00:30:40,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Pokemon was always a butcher, though.

495
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:44,682
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to watch it in Japanese, and then you didn't see what they did to Digimon.

496
00:30:44,702 --> 00:30:48,285
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I can't believe Kids WB took out all the strobing that was in that show.

497
00:30:48,685 --> 00:30:50,326
[SPEAKER_05]: And they took out the boob scene.

498
00:30:50,887 --> 00:30:55,190
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the part where Kojiro, what was he in Digimon?

499
00:30:56,018 --> 00:30:59,599
[SPEAKER_05]: James, and I'm so ashamed I know that Are there any TV networks you do like?

500
00:31:19,916 --> 00:31:20,696
[SPEAKER_05]: I like sci-fi.

501
00:31:20,937 --> 00:31:21,717
[SPEAKER_05]: They play Stargate.

502
00:31:22,678 --> 00:31:24,780
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Food Network for Iron Chef.

503
00:31:25,141 --> 00:31:29,385
[SPEAKER_05]: And I like Court TV and the History Channel and Biography.

504
00:31:30,005 --> 00:31:30,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, sorry.

505
00:31:30,746 --> 00:31:32,508
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a news story on any of those channels.

506
00:31:32,528 --> 00:31:35,510
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do have a news story about G4, Television for Gamers.

507
00:31:35,771 --> 00:31:36,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

508
00:31:37,112 --> 00:31:38,193
[SPEAKER_05]: We like G4.

509
00:31:38,553 --> 00:31:41,556
[SPEAKER_03]: G4ia has their nominees coming out for...

510
00:31:43,057 --> 00:31:48,520
[SPEAKER_03]: G4 has their nominees coming out for G4ia, which is going to be taking place live August... No, I'm sorry.

511
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,121
[SPEAKER_03]: It's July 27th, but will be shown on August 9th.

512
00:31:51,561 --> 00:31:52,561
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not really live.

513
00:31:52,601 --> 00:31:54,102
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of those tape delay things, but whatever.

514
00:31:55,022 --> 00:31:56,523
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing things a little differently this year.

515
00:31:56,963 --> 00:31:59,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Industry experts select the nominees.

516
00:31:59,905 --> 00:32:01,505
[SPEAKER_03]: The gamers get to vote on them.

517
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:03,526
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it's probably through their website or something.

518
00:32:03,626 --> 00:32:06,448
[SPEAKER_05]: So we get more... What was it?

519
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:07,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

520
00:32:09,002 --> 00:32:14,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Best Innovation, Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, Field of Magic XYXX, Katamari Damacy, Full Spectrum Warrior, and PsyOps The Mindgate Conspiracy

521
00:32:35,107 --> 00:32:36,128
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this.

522
00:32:36,148 --> 00:32:37,049
[SPEAKER_02]: PsyOps is a good game.

523
00:32:37,129 --> 00:32:41,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would Field of Magic get a nomination because it's a ripoff of WarioWare?

524
00:32:41,533 --> 00:32:42,473
[SPEAKER_03]: And Luminous doesn't?

525
00:32:42,634 --> 00:32:44,715
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

526
00:32:45,035 --> 00:32:52,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Best Original Soundtrack, Katamari Damacy, Fable, World of Warcraft, Halo 2, God of War.

527
00:32:53,242 --> 00:32:56,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, granted, all those games actually had really good soundtracks.

528
00:32:56,345 --> 00:32:58,467
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't argue with that, especially Katamari Damacy.

529
00:32:59,007 --> 00:32:59,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially that one.

530
00:32:59,728 --> 00:32:59,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude.

531
00:33:01,029 --> 00:33:03,950
[SPEAKER_03]: For the types of games they were, I actually really enjoyed Fable's soundtrack as well.

532
00:33:04,131 --> 00:33:06,912
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another category for licensed soundtrack, which Luminous was in.

533
00:33:06,932 --> 00:33:07,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Halo's gonna win, you know.

534
00:33:08,172 --> 00:33:08,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?

535
00:33:08,532 --> 00:33:10,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Halo's gonna win because everyone votes Halo no matter what.

536
00:33:10,913 --> 00:33:13,014
[SPEAKER_02]: They could be like, best breakfast cereal.

537
00:33:13,114 --> 00:33:16,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Halo can be a nominee up against Fruit Loops or something like that.

538
00:33:16,976 --> 00:33:17,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Halo.

539
00:33:17,776 --> 00:33:18,437
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not cereal.

540
00:33:18,617 --> 00:33:21,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Right in the Nintendo breakfast system.

541
00:33:22,078 --> 00:33:23,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Best original game.

542
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:28,801
[SPEAKER_03]: PsyOps, The Mindgate Conspiracy, Full Spectrum Warrior, God of War, Katamari Damacy, and Psychonauts.

543
00:33:30,044 --> 00:33:33,266
[SPEAKER_03]: God of War, or Katamari Damashii.

544
00:33:33,306 --> 00:33:44,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is, Game of the Year, Half-Life 2, Halo 2, World of Warcraft, God of War, Resident Evil 4, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

545
00:33:45,497 --> 00:33:46,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Katamari Damashii should be in there.

546
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,762
[SPEAKER_05]: I disagree with the entire list.

547
00:33:52,503 --> 00:33:56,106
[SPEAKER_02]: The production values for God of War, you can't really top that.

548
00:33:56,126 --> 00:33:56,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Considering

549
00:33:57,467 --> 00:34:00,529
[SPEAKER_03]: The audience in mind and the gaming public as a general.

550
00:34:00,549 --> 00:34:01,909
[SPEAKER_03]: We play a certain niche of games.

551
00:34:01,969 --> 00:34:07,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Taking the gaming public as a general, I guess, this list doesn't surprise me at all.

552
00:34:07,752 --> 00:34:10,133
[SPEAKER_03]: This honestly seems like a fair representation.

553
00:34:10,153 --> 00:34:11,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Are these all experts?

554
00:34:11,294 --> 00:34:13,975
[SPEAKER_05]: We're like the lunchtime poll in Heathers.

555
00:34:15,616 --> 00:34:20,158
[SPEAKER_05]: If the world was going to explode tomorrow and you had $6 million today, what would you do with it?

556
00:34:20,778 --> 00:34:22,521
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd go buy me Halo 2.

557
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:30,931
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have liked to have seen a niche title, a black horse candidate, if you will, like Katamari Damacy or Luminous or something.

558
00:34:32,052 --> 00:34:33,174
[SPEAKER_03]: But it didn't happen.

559
00:34:33,514 --> 00:34:33,975
[SPEAKER_03]: What can you say?

560
00:34:35,171 --> 00:34:36,552
[SPEAKER_03]: So check that out if you want to.

561
00:34:36,632 --> 00:34:37,592
[SPEAKER_03]: It's over on G4.

562
00:34:38,893 --> 00:34:40,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Guitar Hero, that's the new game coming out.

563
00:34:42,074 --> 00:34:43,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Harmonix is teaming up with Red Octane.

564
00:34:43,975 --> 00:34:46,936
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like a cross between Karaoke Revolution and Guitar Freaks.

565
00:34:46,976 --> 00:34:48,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Some songs have been announced.

566
00:34:49,057 --> 00:34:52,538
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know how they kind of did cover songs in Karaoke Revolution?

567
00:34:52,558 --> 00:34:53,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's going to be the same deal.

568
00:34:53,999 --> 00:34:55,880
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to do cover songs in Guitar Hero.

569
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,761
[SPEAKER_03]: But the covers in Karaoke Revolution weren't bad.

570
00:34:58,981 --> 00:35:00,022
[SPEAKER_03]: I've definitely heard worse.

571
00:35:00,122 --> 00:35:00,642
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't bad.

572
00:35:01,147 --> 00:35:03,128
[SPEAKER_03]: So this should be interesting, the Guitar Hero.

573
00:35:03,168 --> 00:35:04,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's some of the songs that are going to be in it.

574
00:35:04,689 --> 00:35:24,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Red Hot Chili Peppers with Higher Ground, Boston, More Than a Feelin', Mega Death, Symphony of Destruction, Donna's Take It Off, Jimi Hendrix, Spanish Castle Magic, ZZ Top, Sharp Dressed Man, Black Sabbath, Iron Man, White Zombie, Thundercat 65, Queen of the Stone Age, No One Knows, David Bowie, Ziggy Stardust,

575
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:32,927
[SPEAKER_03]: The Ramones, I Want To Be Sedated, Franz Ferdinand, Take Me Out, Deep Purple, Smoke On The Water, Cream, Crossroads, Sum 41, Fat Lip.

576
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,848
[SPEAKER_05]: You had me at David Bowie.

577
00:35:35,548 --> 00:35:36,608
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Ziggy Stardust.

578
00:35:37,049 --> 00:35:44,112
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of like the direction they're going with this because it got a lot of classic guitar blended with the newer bands that are known for guitars.

579
00:35:44,132 --> 00:35:48,934
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the style of play that makes me think of that Johnny Whatever on the Gizmondo.

580
00:35:49,074 --> 00:35:49,514
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit.

581
00:35:49,754 --> 00:35:52,936
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I love, and they should have put it in there, is aerodynamical.

582
00:35:53,709 --> 00:35:54,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is just partial.

583
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:55,350
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just partial.

584
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:55,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Daft Punk.

585
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:58,191
[SPEAKER_02]: That has one hell of a guitar solo in it.

586
00:35:58,571 --> 00:35:58,931
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

587
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody brought this up a little earlier in the show, but I just want to clarify.

588
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:08,335
[SPEAKER_03]: The revolution, the Nintendo revolution, there was a report over on Joystick.com.

589
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:14,777
[SPEAKER_03]: That's with a Q. Joystick.com is reporting that they will be getting a graphical upgrade.

590
00:36:14,877 --> 00:36:15,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember how...

591
00:36:17,912 --> 00:36:25,959
[SPEAKER_03]: They announced months ago that Nintendo and Super Nintendo titles all the way up through 64 titles will be downloadable through the revolution.

592
00:36:26,139 --> 00:36:27,801
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to get a graphical upgrade of some sort.

593
00:36:28,615 --> 00:36:29,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Kid Icarus, The Sotelo View

594
00:36:48,586 --> 00:36:57,330
[SPEAKER_05]: which was, we didn't get it over here, but it was like a download system where you could, you could actually download the ROMs for it now, the upgraded Zelda for Satellaview.

595
00:36:58,431 --> 00:37:01,933
[SPEAKER_05]: There were a bunch of different games, but they were all downloadable.

596
00:37:01,973 --> 00:37:03,673
[SPEAKER_05]: You could play them for a time limit and then.

597
00:37:04,274 --> 00:37:04,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, okay.

598
00:37:05,655 --> 00:37:17,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I can't see them going back and re-skinning all their old games, so I don't think it's that, although maybe for some of them it will be, because, like we were saying earlier in the show, why would you pay to download this stuff when you can emulate it for free?

599
00:37:17,044 --> 00:37:18,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe that's a big incentive.

600
00:37:19,265 --> 00:37:24,089
[SPEAKER_03]: To play Kid Icarus with really nice Super Nintendo or even better graphics, I'd pay for that.

601
00:37:24,129 --> 00:37:25,590
[SPEAKER_03]: I really would.

602
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,092
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want a freaking sequel to that game, that's all.

603
00:37:28,593 --> 00:37:29,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that too much to ask?

604
00:37:30,914 --> 00:37:34,017
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to be asked what the code was for Kid Icarus, by the way.

605
00:37:35,194 --> 00:37:37,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Icarus Fights Medusa Angels Terror Danger Horror!

606
00:37:54,707 --> 00:37:54,907
[SPEAKER_03]: GamePal

607
00:38:12,146 --> 00:38:17,487
[SPEAKER_03]: and Game Pal, what it does is it allows you to rent a character in an online world.

608
00:38:17,507 --> 00:38:20,868
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it might be a play on the term Game Fly because you know how that's a rental service.

609
00:38:21,168 --> 00:38:40,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Game Pal, for just a $300 deposit and for $150 for the first month and $130 for each month after that, you can have your choice of up to 50 accounts, one of 50 accounts for 14 popular MMOs, Star Wars Galaxies, Ultima Online, EverQuest, City of Heroes,

610
00:38:42,068 --> 00:38:45,151
[SPEAKER_03]: But the trick is, is that when you're renting these characters, you're renting God characters.

611
00:38:45,171 --> 00:38:46,953
[SPEAKER_03]: You're renting the highest they go.

612
00:38:47,053 --> 00:38:49,856
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, maximum level, all the good gear.

613
00:38:50,636 --> 00:38:51,237
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?

614
00:38:52,912 --> 00:38:55,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this a practical idea or is it a big joke?

615
00:38:55,653 --> 00:38:56,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Pisses me off.

616
00:38:56,494 --> 00:39:04,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, for example, on Ragnarok, I put in, what, two and a half years into my character to get her to level 70-something.

617
00:39:05,318 --> 00:39:09,479
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it would just piss me off to see someone come in with a level 100 character right off the bat.

618
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,580
[SPEAKER_05]: It's ridiculous.

619
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,081
[SPEAKER_03]: That's interesting because they're renting these characters, not selling them.

620
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:13,661
[SPEAKER_03]: They're renting them.

621
00:39:13,681 --> 00:39:14,822
[SPEAKER_03]: They should charge even more.

622
00:39:14,942 --> 00:39:16,342
[SPEAKER_03]: The prices are a little weird.

623
00:39:16,382 --> 00:39:18,183
[SPEAKER_05]: They should jack those prices even more.

624
00:39:18,243 --> 00:39:19,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Make them pay for that privilege.

625
00:39:20,003 --> 00:39:22,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, I know you've openly admitted to you don't care.

626
00:39:23,264 --> 00:39:24,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Buy your money online.

627
00:39:24,205 --> 00:39:24,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Who cares?

628
00:39:24,465 --> 00:39:25,205
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's stupid.

629
00:39:25,305 --> 00:39:26,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Who would pay that kind of money for that?

630
00:39:27,186 --> 00:39:27,766
[SPEAKER_02]: An idiot would.

631
00:39:28,206 --> 00:39:35,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, for that kind of money, you could be buying a lot of online currency and get your character maxed out anyways.

632
00:39:36,109 --> 00:39:38,331
[SPEAKER_02]: For that money, you could actually buy groceries for two weeks.

633
00:39:51,184 --> 00:39:52,946
[SPEAKER_05]: You can use that as a car payment.

634
00:39:53,626 --> 00:39:56,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Get a babysitter for your baby when you go out to play World of Warcraft.

635
00:39:56,769 --> 00:40:01,573
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, goddammit people, live in the real fucking world, okay?

636
00:40:02,134 --> 00:40:10,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Games are fine every now and again, but keep in mind that your money, you know, you should use it responsibly or else you're going to end up like one of those losers whose baby died.

637
00:40:11,663 --> 00:40:13,824
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll be a loser, not a winner.

638
00:40:14,885 --> 00:40:16,487
[SPEAKER_05]: But that doesn't mean that you shouldn't play your games at all.

639
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:19,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Another World of Warcraft story I have for you guys.

640
00:40:19,642 --> 00:40:20,943
[SPEAKER_03]: They're getting an expansion pack.

641
00:40:21,323 --> 00:40:22,785
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's pretty much all I have to say.

642
00:40:22,825 --> 00:40:24,307
[SPEAKER_03]: There's really not a whole lot of news besides that.

643
00:40:24,327 --> 00:40:26,249
[SPEAKER_03]: They announced that they're making an expansion pack.

644
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:29,332
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of the duh news of the week, you know.

645
00:40:29,652 --> 00:40:29,732
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

646
00:40:29,752 --> 00:40:30,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

647
00:40:30,673 --> 00:40:31,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Over 2 million people.

648
00:40:32,435 --> 00:40:33,376
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a dork.

649
00:40:33,857 --> 00:40:36,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Over 2 million people on this MMO.

650
00:40:36,339 --> 00:40:38,001
[SPEAKER_03]: You think we might do an expansion or 12?

651
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:38,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

652
00:40:39,900 --> 00:41:04,942
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll stick with PSO, thank you, until Ragnarok 2 comes out I'm still curious about WoW I'm taking a break from MMOs in general right now I'm kind of burnt on them, but I think when I come back I will check out WoW I still think you should play PSO with me I'm on a break I will pay for you a month to play PSO with me We'll see I can't say anything against free stuff, we'll see Alright, one last story for you guys tonight You know Happy Tree Friends?

653
00:41:06,874 --> 00:41:15,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, these were the shorts they used to show at Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted where they had these cute lovable furry animals and they kill each other senseless.

654
00:41:15,777 --> 00:41:17,738
[SPEAKER_03]: They gouge out eyeballs and all this stuff.

655
00:41:18,498 --> 00:41:23,080
[SPEAKER_03]: So what more would be perfect for Happy Tree friends than for them to get their own video game?

656
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,481
[SPEAKER_03]: It's happening.

657
00:41:25,821 --> 00:41:31,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Brad Young, chief executive of Flashman Studios, says it's an almost perfect brand for video games.

658
00:41:31,445 --> 00:41:42,914
[SPEAKER_03]: The simple, cute, and hugely appealing graphical style combined with a very dark, clever humor and the cartoon violence provides a wonderful opportunity for the video games market to tap into a huge global fan base.

659
00:41:44,375 --> 00:41:47,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Might I add, I hope this turns out better than Clay Fighters.

660
00:41:47,937 --> 00:41:48,858
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked Clay Fighters.

661
00:41:48,938 --> 00:41:50,059
[SPEAKER_05]: It was all about Helga.

662
00:41:50,905 --> 00:41:55,529
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought Clay Fighters was... It was one of those one-trick games.

663
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,552
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was all about... Who was this Mr. Frosty?

664
00:42:00,454 --> 00:42:01,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, I love Clay Fighters.

665
00:42:02,236 --> 00:42:03,937
[SPEAKER_05]: How could you put down Clay Fighters?

666
00:42:03,957 --> 00:42:06,940
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't like Clay Fighters because I had Street Fighter 2, which was much better.

667
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,381
[SPEAKER_05]: So did I, and I had Clay Fighters.

668
00:42:08,662 --> 00:42:09,302
[SPEAKER_05]: It was all about C2.

669
00:42:11,198 --> 00:42:16,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you're awfully quiet, but you were the first one to show me a DVD full of these things.

670
00:42:16,662 --> 00:42:18,903
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually cringed at some of these cartoons.

671
00:42:18,943 --> 00:42:21,565
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes a lot to gross me out, but some of these are nasty.

672
00:42:22,105 --> 00:42:26,208
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just building off the popularity of Conker, Live and Reloaded.

673
00:42:28,103 --> 00:42:31,604
[SPEAKER_03]: I seem to recall that G4 was running these in some capacity too.

674
00:42:31,624 --> 00:42:40,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're running them on their Attack of the Show show that's on their network, and it's kind of like, ooh, look at us, we're hip and, yeah.

675
00:42:40,486 --> 00:42:44,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they do, like, they show, like, popular clips on the web, and it doesn't surprise me so much.

676
00:42:44,948 --> 00:42:45,588
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you know.

677
00:42:45,648 --> 00:42:46,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

678
00:42:47,001 --> 00:43:10,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's jump on board this now, you know, what, you know, how many years All aboard the sellout train, woo woo, you know we'd hop on it too, we would hop on it too How late are they, well, while we're at it, let's get a Strong Bad game, you know, hey, that'd be fun Hey, no, that would be fun I am surprised that hasn't happened already Imagine if you had, like, the whole Strong Bad RPG Hey, what do you think's the first website that's gonna become a movie?

679
00:43:13,827 --> 00:43:15,488
[SPEAKER_03]: First website to become a movie?

680
00:43:15,569 --> 00:43:16,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, first website.

681
00:43:16,689 --> 00:43:18,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Just as long as it's not Tub Girl or Goat Day.

682
00:43:18,411 --> 00:43:20,032
[SPEAKER_05]: What if it's DarkSakura.com?

683
00:43:20,933 --> 00:43:22,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is like not updated every year?

684
00:43:23,855 --> 00:43:24,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah.

685
00:43:24,356 --> 00:43:24,596
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

686
00:43:25,096 --> 00:43:27,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I thought you actually had an answer.

687
00:43:27,458 --> 00:43:28,439
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I didn't have an answer.

688
00:43:28,459 --> 00:43:30,061
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just throwing out a question.

689
00:43:30,221 --> 00:43:37,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, funny enough, I looked up DarkSakura in Google Images to see what I could find, and the third picture was Shermie, my cat.

690
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:39,531
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, all one word under Google Image Search

691
00:44:07,709 --> 00:44:12,245
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was sitting there, you know, playing my game and all of a sudden I feel the ground under me roll.

692
00:44:12,305 --> 00:44:14,212
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, damn, this is a realistic game.

693
00:44:15,237 --> 00:44:17,279
[SPEAKER_03]: The first earthquake I ever felt, though, was in Alabama.

694
00:44:39,611 --> 00:44:40,391
[SPEAKER_05]: A tremor off the coast.

695
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:41,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a state known for their earthquakes.

696
00:44:41,732 --> 00:44:42,893
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a tremor off the coast.

697
00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:43,293
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

698
00:44:43,513 --> 00:44:44,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Your final thought, DarkSakura?

699
00:44:45,114 --> 00:44:45,794
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought?

700
00:44:46,195 --> 00:44:47,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Reject false icons.

701
00:44:49,076 --> 00:44:49,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I said so.

702
00:44:50,797 --> 00:44:54,399
[SPEAKER_03]: And my final thought is I want candy, so I'm going to go get it right now.

703
00:44:54,419 --> 00:44:55,220
[SPEAKER_03]: I want candy.

704
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:55,540
[SPEAKER_03]: I am.

705
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys very much.

706
00:44:57,481 --> 00:44:58,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a great week.

707
00:44:58,401 --> 00:45:01,203
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you next time on the Orange Lounge Radio to-go edition.

708
00:45:02,927 --> 00:45:06,512
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.
