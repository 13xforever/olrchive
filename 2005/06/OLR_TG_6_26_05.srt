Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition week of June 27th, 2005.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,960
dedicated to those video games that don't suck and well sometimes we do have

3
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,420
to talk about some that do but not very many we try to keep that to a minimum my

4
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,520
name is Rob Roberts you might know me as Sky join me as always my awesome co-host

5

6
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,820
know the ones that suck are the ones we make fun of of course we have to bring

7
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:59,080
them up so we can tease bash them into a broken silicon and wires and melted

8
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,800
plastic and then of course you know a reoccurring theme that's come up a lot

9
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,280
lately or the games that are being turned into movies that we get to bash

10
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,340
into a bloody pulp and all that stuff don't get me and I have another one to

11
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:14,460
talk about tonight joy joy joy also joining us tech massa one and only Loki

12
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:21,100
I am here how you doing I'm here all right here we are he's there yeah he's

13
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,500
there you're here we're all here this is me in the corner in the in the person

14
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,500
Is that you in the spotlight?

15
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,500
That's me in the spotlight.

16
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,500
Yeah.

17
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,500
Great.

18
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,620
Just a reminder, Horns On Treaty to Go edition is actually brought to you in MP3 Pro encoding.

19
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:37,460
So if you don't like the way this sounds on your iPod, that's because iPods don't have

20
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,620
the MP3 Pro thing.

21
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,820
I wish they did, but maybe they'll get that in the future.

22
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,040
But if you listen to this on Winamp or whatever, you can get a MP3 Pro codec, and this show

23
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,040
sounds even better.

24
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,220
You can hear us in full stereo and everything.

25
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,220
It's great.

26
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,220
Anyway.

27
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,120
Just thought I'd throw that out there, because I haven't talked about that in like 25 weeks

28
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,120
or so.

29
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,700
I thought I'd bring that up again.

30
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,440
All right, let's get into it.

31
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,060
First off, before we get into the news,

32
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,440
we'll always like to let you guys know

33
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,800
what we've been up to, how our gaming weeks have been,

34
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,080
what we've been playing.

35
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,400
Dark Sakura, I know you've been busy with moving and stuff.

36
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,360
Have you had any time for gaming?

37
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,360
I played one quest on PSO, and that was it.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,840
Busy, busy.

39
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,240
It's amazing what the real life will do to you.

40
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,280
I did the caves.

41
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,440
And how'd that go?

42
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,760
Well, this thing is how I have a full power mag

43
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:28,400
at the time of the level 11 character. I'm level 13 now. I was just like die, die, die,

44
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,640
die, die, die, die, die, die, die. How's PSO going now that it went pay? Is there a lot

45
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,800
less people on there? I haven't noticed. I always play by myself or with people I know

46
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,240
anyway. It's PSO. Same thing it always was. We're supposed to have ep 4 though. I need

47
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,600
to check that out. I'm looking forward to the Phantasy Star universe too that they were

48
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,040
show on E3. It looked pretty cool. Yeah, that was pretty cool. Alright, so Loki, how was

49
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:59,160
your gaming week? What'd you play? I picked up Destroy All Humans. You know, remembering

50
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:05,200
that you also ran out and bought Alien Hamed and you like these invader zimish alien taking

51
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,120
over the world type games, doesn't surprise me one bit that you ran out and bought it.

52
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,400
Well, the only reason I bought Alien Hamed is because it reminded me of Contra and Metal

53
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,360
Slug. That's the only reason I bought that game. But no, Destroy All Humans was basically

54
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:24,560
for the... it's the same reason I bought Dog's Life. In fact, this game is very... it reminds

55
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,160
me of a dog's life in a lot of aspects. Except for the fact that you're an alien and the

56
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,480
other one you're a dog and this alien has the ability to throw stuff telekinetically

57
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,960
which just offers endless playability right there. You can just pick up chickens, throw

58
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:44,920
them into walls, pick up people, throw them against the ground, pick up a cow, throw it

59
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,240
into the air. Help me understand this game a little bit, because I've seen the commercials

60
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,200
and everything, so I understand that you play as an alien who is destroying all humans.

61
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,520
Why? Why? Why are they killing all humans? Why are they destroying all humans? Okay.

62
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,680
Well basically what happens is this race of aliens or whatever, they're from some distant

63
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,920
planet and a long, long time ago when they destroyed the Martians or whatever, they got

64
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,360
pissed off or whatever and came to Earth, they found that it was very primitive and

65
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:16,620
not so they injected some of their DNA into the early humans and since their

66
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:22,660
race has no ability to reproduce they have to clone themselves and after a

67
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:28,540
while generations and generations their clones have become inferior to what they

68
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,980
used to be so now they've come back to earth to extract this DNA from humans

69
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,820
and at the same time just destroy the whole planet because you know they're

70
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,840
destruction for no particular that's because that that's what they do that's

71
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,020
why they destroyed the Martians are like Jamie driving in her new car hey you

72
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,400
ran my car with me today and I didn't kill anybody while you were there

73
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,000
although you wanted to stupid van although it is a lot of fun and

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,200
basically put you right in the middle of us like a cheesy be sci-fi movie from

75
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:03,080
like the 50s and it's great just you know so much um playability in there

76
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,520
the commercials gave me the impression that it has that grand theft auto ish

77
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,440
style of, just do whatever the hell you want. If you want to follow the story, do it. Is

78
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,440
that true?

79
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:18,700
Sort of. Like I said, it's very similar to A Dog's Life 4. You've got the missions that

80
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,500
you're supposed to be doing, but after you finish the mission, you're still in the level

81
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:29,220
so you can collect what's left of, there's like these hidden, almost like probes or whatever

82
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,320
you have to find, and then that unlocks some other stuff. And then you can also extract

83
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:38,960
DNA from the people and that you can use to upgrade your ship, upgrade your abilities

84
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,960
and whatnot.

85
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,600
But meantime I just have fun going and destroying all the houses and stuff in your spaceship

86
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:52,120
and just throwing stuff in the walls and whatnot.

87
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,120
Graphics good?

88
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,480
The graphics are pretty good, they're decent.

89
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:00,520
I do like throwing chickens in the people and killing people with chickens, that's great.

90
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,080
Would you recommend the game to our listeners?

91
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,260
oh yeah definitely go go play it there's not much in July so

92
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,620
it's a good game. For everybody to play or for a certain audience?

93
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,920
Oh it's for everyone just go honestly just go play it I mean it's a lot of fun even if

94
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,560
you don't buy it

95
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,480
rent it it's great. I'm done.

96
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:23,000
I got a call actually today from Dan while he was at work asking me if I wanted a

97
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,160
black Labrador

98
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,720
a miniature dachshund or a chihuahua. You're getting a doggy?

99
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,560
I'm getting a Nintendog. Ah, I see. So I went for the Black Lab.

100
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,400
Now, this is because in Japan they have them all separated into the

101
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,680
different packs, right? But they're not doing that here, are they? Yes, they are.

102
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,400
Are they? Three of them. I was never quite clear on whether they were

103
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,840
splitting it up or not, because E3 I didn't get that impression.

104
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,920
They are dope. I'm getting the Black Lab.

105
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,600
Which will make one of our listeners who uses that as an alias very happy.

106
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,440
Exactly. I even posted in my live channel,

107
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,280
Puppy you should dig this. I actually picked the Black Lab because it goes with my little

108
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,640
freebie thing that I got it E3. I'm gonna get a Chihuahua because Chihuahuas

109
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,440
annoy everybody. Actually um

110
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,120
they do have, well if you notice all the um US ones have different dogs than the

111
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,080
Japanese ones. However the um US ones

112
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,380
you can unlock the Japanese dogs and also for example if someone has the

113
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,520
Chihuahua one, someone has the mini dash-hound

114
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,920
and you, you I guess interact with the Chihuahua one

115
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,000
it unlocks the Chihuahua on yours. So we should all make sure we get different ones

116
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,160
when we look at the game. Is there a Shih Tzu? Yes there is a Shih Tzu. I have to get a Shih Tzu

117
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,080
just so I can say I have a Shih Tzu.

118
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,120
It's technically a Shih Tzu. I like Shih Tzu.

119
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,320
Yeah, puh. I almost picked the Dachshund

120
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,640
but I like the Black Labs.

121
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:50,040
Yeah, I'm still waiting for Nintendo. Labrador Retriever, Chihuahua, and me dash on.

122
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,280
Alright, speaking of DS games, my gaming week, what I got to play this week was

123
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,480
Bomberman DS

124
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:59,180
Which I am pretty pleased with you know, what can I say? It's Bomberman

125
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,680
There's probably been a version of Bomberman on just about every console

126
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:09,480
Jamie you're probably more of an expert at this than I am. PC Engine is all about Bomberman 93. I knew it had was on PC Engine

127
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,560
But like was there one on Genesis? I don't know. There was no

128
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,120
I don't think there was a Bomberman on Genesis

129
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,740
But like damn near every console. The best version ever is Super Bomberman 2 on Super Nintendo

130
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,660
I I do remember the old Super Nintendo, there were like four of them on Super Nintendo. We had the

131
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:30,640
The multi-tap well if you if you're a Bomberman fan, this is pretty much classic Bomberman, but the very cool thing

132
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:35,840
I love what they did with this Bomberman DS is that you can play a person multiplayer one cartridge

133
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,660
None of this everybody's got to have the cartridge and play the game

134
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,280
Because the DS is wireless and everything and just send the game over and eight people can play off one cartridge

135
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,460
I think that's awesome. And this is what else I love about the DS

136
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,320
Here in this game is that it's not touch at all

137
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:56,000
it's using the two screen thing I think you can like you can set the controls to

138
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,480
use the touchscreen if you want but I'm loving it now that the games aren't

139
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,560
feeling the need to whore the touch thing incessantly like they're actually

140
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,880
coming up with good games that use just the two screen feature and that's what

141
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,920
Bomberman does because there's eight people now you have eight corners

142
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,880
because there's the two screens so it works out pretty well graphic wise it's

143
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,160
just you know what you expect from a Bomberman game probably you know a

144
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,000
little better than what you saw in Super Nintendo but you know it's it's it's

145
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,820
It's Bomberman, it's not gonna revolutionize the graphic world, and it's just, it's a fun,

146
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:29,100
it's a very good handheld game, because handheld games are supposed to be the quick and easy,

147
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,580
fun party games.

148
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,220
I think it's a good title, and 20 bucks, not bad.

149
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:38,040
So I definitely would recommend Bomberman DS for anybody looking for just a quick puzzle,

150
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:43,220
or you got a lot of friends with DS's looking for a new game to play, Bomberman DS is for

151
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,220
you.

152
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:49,960
wise I had my birthday on the 26th I know I don't want to talk about my age

153
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:55,500
but some of my friends got together and bought me a PSP which was very cool so I

154
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,660
have PSP now and of course the very first thing I did with it because yeah I

155
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,940
don't know if you guys were listening to this show like I don't know a couple

156
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,620
months ago but I actually picked up a copy of luminous before I had a PSP and

157
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,220
I just let my friend borrow it cuz I'm like you can't get a PSP and not get

158
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,940
luminous I will buy it for when I get a PSP well he still has my copy of luminous

159
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:17,900
Unfortunately, so I have nothing to play on my PSP right now. So the very first thing I do in my PSP

160
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,780
I've fired up the homebrew page

161
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:28,060
On the internet and I downloaded some Nintendo emulator and some ROMs Dan's been going crazy with that. We've got awesome

162
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,060
We've got a gigabyte memory card. It's awesome

163
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,980
So yeah, he's got something like 50 ROMs on it

164
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,500
It kind of works out for Sony in the long run too because you know

165
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:42,500
Nintendo has been selling some of these games for $20 a pop and now people can play them for free on their PSP

166
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,240
Although it's one of those things that nobody's supposed to talk about, but yeah

167
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,640
You can't this kind of thing has to be a selling point for the PSP

168
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:55,560
Yeah for some people for me. It definitely sells it so Loki. I'll let you start tonight

169
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,200
I know you probably I I kind of spoiled it there. We've got the no swap

170
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,120
trick there now for the

171
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:09,520
Emulators, but what else is new in the hack and crack scene well that that was pretty much the news this week was that the new

172
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:15,960
exploit was released on Wednesday I believe and it's basically not very

173
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,240
different from the last exploit you basically have two folders on one memory

174
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,400
card except one of them has a percent sign at the end of it and you basically

175
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:33,560
have your two sets of eboot files and it just runs off your memory card now no

176
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:39,000
need to swap just go. What an easy fix that'll be for Sony though so careful

177
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,840
when you play Grand Theft Auto because you know they're gonna load it on there

178
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:47,160
sooner than that actually really first game in July coded arms is gonna be one

179
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:52,020
that's gonna force it up to one five two however why are coded arms only gonna be

180
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:56,800
one five no one five two that's the Japanese one

181
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,080
five two and guess what folks but they're working on one five one one five

182
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,880
two already and it's gonna be a matter of time before that's not even an issue

183
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,840
It's gonna be like Trillion and AOL like every time AOL patches their server

184
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:17,060
So Trillion can't use it anymore within two days Trillion has a workaround. It's just gonna be the same thing. It's great. And

185
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:24,160
So yeah, that that's it's been the major news. Actually, it's been some cool homebrew games coming out, you know

186
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,600
Some blackjack casino stuff that's kind of neat

187
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,200
actually another thing that was

188
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,440
pretty interesting was

189
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,360
the Game Boy Advance Simulator actually for the Game Boy Advance Simulator

190
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,560
PSP PSP interesting how's it full-speed I'm runs pretty good

191
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,800
I'm the only thing it does it's limited to I'm files that are

192
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,680
under 8 megs it all right the ROMs have to be under the Nintendo one's not

193
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,600
perfect the Nintendo one I notice wouldn't play life force was one

194
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,440
favorite Nintendo games

195
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,320
and one play a gyrus so it's is not the other games that I won't play

196
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,320
the well the two I feel you actually find Guardian legend though

197
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,240
to test it. I have it. Yeah, you have to check also

198
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,000
what was I gonna say? The fantasy zone. Just like

199
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,400
you have to watch the

200
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,680
ROM dumps. Sometimes some of them are bad and you can get a new dump and that's

201
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,720
works fine. It's just, you know, you just have to watch. Actually, Dan tried the

202
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,480
Game Boy Advance one and it ran Fire Emblem like crap.

203
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:29,560
He said it ran it so slow that it was a torture to play it.

204
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,720
She didn't bother with it.

205
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,360
You know now that we're seeing that the things get this advanced you gotta go

206
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,960
well you know if Sony is gonna try and screw with people so that they're gonna

207
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,640
their firmware is gonna be forced to upgrade

208
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,160
you really can't blame them because this could be this could get ugly

209
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,960
if this gets big. But technically it's money out of their pockets.

210
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,840
It's gonna get ugly if this stuff gets too mainstream. The other thing I was gonna mention is

211
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:57,600
a game coming out later on this year, this summer, Burnout Legends. One of the unique

212
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,680
things about it is it will be able to share a demo level with other people via download

213
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:09,680
play type thing. So that's kind of a first also for the PSP, which is kind of neat. And

214
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:15,080
I know that's already been built into it and you'll be able to download games or whatnot,

215
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:20,300
hopefully to your memory stick. So that will be coming out with Burnout Legends and then

216
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:26,220
also really there's some good games coming out I know Midnight Club 3 just

217
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:30,180
got released so that's gonna be coming out you know next week so you can pick

218
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:34,140
that up and then you know a bunch of cool stuff coming out MIDI evil they're

219
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,620
working on so it's a good summer for PSP.

220
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,700
Alright cool. One quick question I just want to pose to you guys and those of you

221
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,860
that are listening at home as well I'm kind of curious with the news about the

222
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:48,620
Nintendo emulation and everything usually people say emulation is not a

223
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,360
a bad thing because you're only playing things that you can't buy in the store

224
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,460
anymore and that's kind of that's like the justification you've seen this is

225
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:00,640
this Nintendo emulation ethical considering that Nintendo is still

226
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,860
trying to profit off some of these old titles through their GBA classic series

227
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:10,240
what do you think from a support standpoint you know it is not ethical I

228
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:16,440
believe because technically all right so they're like example they're we

229
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,540
releasing Zelda you know that's out but say that you have an emulator to play it

230
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:27,020
that is however much say $35 that Nintendo is not going to get now say

231
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:32,100
that this is you times about a hundred other people that's $3500 that

232
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,100
Nintendo's not getting that means that any future game that comes out it's

233
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,980
going to jack the price because they have to make up for loss of sales on

234
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,660
that you know I know that they figure this in though when they set price points

235
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:47,700
But the thing is is that the price is going to keep going up the more that this goes on

236
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:55,180
Counterpoint counterpoint is they shouldn't be trying to resell fucking the first game of Zelda in the first place

237
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,960
I'm not gonna pay $20 for a game. That's been out for years now

238
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,280
Why should I have to buy some stupid game to run on the Gameboy Advance?

239
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,780
I'm gonna run a damn emulator and play it for free and

240
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:11,300
That's my take on even their other stuff with the new revolution big whoopity-doo. There's new graphics

241
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,660
Well, yeah, and then this kind of leads into one story

242
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:18,900
You know what? I would rather play every release on my Gameboy Advance than play an emulator

243
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:25,620
Because you technically I could just plug in my Nintendo and play it all I want to it's kind of like if I'm hearing you

244
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:31,300
Right. It's kind of like downloading mp3s from the internet and buying them off iTunes when you buy something iTunes, you know

245
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:36,260
I don't support iTunes. Well, okay or another service a comparable service when you use one of these

246
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:44,880
services you know you're going to get the highest quality yeah file yeah as

247
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,620
opposed to when you try to use lime wire so you're gonna get fake files crappy

248
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:53,080
sounding ones people trying to mess with you and stuff is that kind of how it is

249
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,760
with ROMs versus I'll pay for quality I'll pay for quality one thing that I do

250
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:04,640
support ROMs for is for games that have been heavily edited and games that are

251
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,000
just not coming out over here then I will run a translation patch on him and

252
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,120
like translated like second century yeah okay like the the first Fire Emblem on

253
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,920
the Game Boy Advance they never brought that the one with Roy and Marth never

254
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:23,240
brought that out over here my thought is you know I owned the Zelda cartridge

255
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,600
back in the day so I feel justified in emulating you know granted maybe I'm

256
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,720
playing some other things I didn't necessarily own but I don't know I still

257
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,920
feel like you know I'm buying enough of their new stuff and usually if they if

258
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:41,280
they bring out Zelda redone or I'm trying to think of some of the some of

259
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,800
the other games that they've done like redone recently I mean maybe Metroid

260
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,880
Zero but that's a little loose because it wasn't exactly first game I buy that

261
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,200
stuff right up but if you think about you asked if it is ethical no it is not

262
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:59,720
ethical is it logical yes it is okay but I don't know nobody's perfect

263
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:05,880
Your thoughts at home welcomed togo at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email togo at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

264
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,280
I think it's ethical because they're not putting Nintendo games in the new

265
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,800
Animal Crossing DS. It's damn ethical.

266
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,640
No, that's not ethical. That's the difference between ethics and logic. You are going from a

267
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,920
logical standpoint and not an ethical standpoint.

268
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,640
And trust me, I took three semesters of philosophy so I should know this.

269
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,920
Martha Stewart went to jail over this stuff. I'm just kidding, alright.

270
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,680
It is not ethical. Let's move on. Let's move on

271
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,100
All right, your thoughts again to go at orange launch radio comm to be continued maybe

272
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,860
Zelda Zelda DS, huh, or we will publicly break you over here

273
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:43,200
Zelda DS they are working on one and in an interview with Wired magazine

274
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:51,080
The Legend of Zelda producer says that the Nintendo DS version of Zelda will be primarily controlled via the touchscreen and stylus

275
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,220
to which I say

276
00:18:53,220 --> 00:19:02,040
sigh exactly now I'm I can't judge till I see it because you know Castlevania DS

277
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:07,160
has the stylus thing but it's it's tasteful it's it's limited it's not

278
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:13,720
overboard with it it makes sense so I'm I'm hoping that one word okay what

279
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:21,440
her own just I don't know I I'm a little scared I have to see more on this but

280
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,960
news does kinda make me go, do they have to whore this out in every game?

281
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,160
Well you know they did build it into the system for a reason.

282
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,680
I'm just, but, but it's, but isn't one of the other selling points supposed to be two-screen?

283
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,140
That's like saying god damn those Nintendo games and using the god damn A button.

284
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,800
Why does every game have to use the A button?

285
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,520
It's there for a reason, they use it.

286
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,380
Think about classic Zelda, you would never have to hit the menu button again because

287
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,980
you could always have your menu on the top screen.

288
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,980
That's all you need.

289
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,640
And that's being innovative with the DS.

290
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,600
that's right they called it the DS not the s at the first stylus or the TV TM

291
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:06,120
touch me I don't know TM FM TMI you know we were talking about movies last week

292
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,600
we're talking about all the movie games that are coming out and by the way we

293
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,920
got a correction the the postal thing that's gonna be directed by ue Bowl not

294
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:17,760
really gonna be directed by ue Bowl it's or it's rumor still no confirmation oh

295
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:23,160
We kind of ran it last week. Like it was confirmed. It is not so, you know, sorry. He's directing mistakes

296
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:29,560
He is directing the rated-r version of Tetris the movie. Stop it. He is doing Dungeon Siege though. That is that is

297
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,120
true and now

298
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,880
We've got another game that's going to be made into a movie

299
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,360
We kind of knew about this one for a while American McGee's version of Alice, you know, like Alice in Wonderland

300
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,800
You could say it's Tim Burton meets Tarantino meets just a big bag of crack, basically

301
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:51,640
That's how you could describe Alice. I guess I don't know and you have to have like a really happy computer who run it a

302
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:57,480
Few years when if game first came out. Yeah now it's in most computers could probably handle it

303
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:02,620
Well, they're making a movie out of it and they have casted Sarah Michelle Geller the one you know

304
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,620
What woman needs to eat something?

305
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:13,060
Cuz in the grudge, she was like bone thin. Mm-hmm, and she was really in good shape when she was on Buffy

306
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:19,060
mm-hmm you know cuz she consistently had to exercise for the role and to eat

307
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:24,380
directed by Marcus Nispel who did the recent remake of the Texas Chainsaw

308
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,620
Massacre I'm thinking maybe being pregnant will help her look better you

309
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,420
know less anorexic they really need to put like Natalie poor I would not the

310
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,200
first rumors I heard were that Natalie Portman would be in it and right now

311
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,180
after you'd be better after seeing closer now we portman's just being

312
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:42,860
everything I think not only portman's hot and she she could at least be more

313
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:51,980
gothy than you know Sarah Michelle Geller was Buffy you guys oh well in

314
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,480
that case let me just stop all the press let's put her in every movie because you

315
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:02,300
know she was Buffy oh no when she was on Buffy she looks healthy I cannot stand

316
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:06,740
seeing Sarah Michelle Geller the way she looks now except that I'm hoping being

317
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:11,180
pregnant will encourage her to eat food and not look like a starved little crow

318
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:17,020
because she looks like she's freaking anorexic and she's no longer pretty all

319
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,340
right well this seems like a very good segue into letting dark Sakura give you

320
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:25,260
a little piece of her mind because you know what if we played video games all

321
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:30,740
day long we'd have no time to go eat at hometown buffet honestly damn straight

322
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:35,140
so we have we're gonna bring you some advice brought to you by the one and

323
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:39,420
only dark Sakura because you know she's just she's that cuz I said so she's the

324
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:46,740
happy furry bunny of our show. I'm not furry, I shaved my legs. Okay dark sagra, so what

325
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:54,740
are you going to be talking to us about tonight? Speaking of babies, today's advice column

326
00:22:54,740 --> 00:23:02,900
is how to deliver a baby. Like, in the postage mail? Like if you're at Walmart. Hey, that

327
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,900
Hey!

328
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,900
My water broke!

329
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,660
That was a Natalie Portman roll, remember that?

330
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,980
Sadly enough it was.

331
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:13,560
Number one, time the uterine contraction.

332
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:19,100
For first time mothers when contractions are about 3-5 minutes apart and last 40-90 seconds

333
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:23,380
and increase in strength and frequency for at least an hour, the labor is most likely

334
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,380
real and not false.

335
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:29,140
I just want to point out, all you 13-21 year old guys, which is the primary demographic

336
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,880
listening to the show keep that in mind

337
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,180
time your uterine contractions it's not

338
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,680
trying to eat you dear shut up have

339
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,180
clean dry towels a clean shirt or

340
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:43,240
something similar on hand number two as

341
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,640
the baby moves out of the womb its head

342
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,800
the biggest part of its body will open

343
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,320
the cervix so the rest of it can pass

344
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,840
through three when the baby is out of

345
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,520
the mother dry it off and keep it warm

346
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,520
God, I'm having flashbacks to the miracle of life.

347
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,520
Shut up! Shut up!

348
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,520
If necessary, clear any fluid out of the baby's mouth with your fingers.

349
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,520
4. Tie off the umbilical cord.

350
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,520
Take a piece of string, a shoelace works as well, and tie off the cord several inches from the baby.

351
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,520
Do not cut the umbilical cord.

352
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,520
5. Get to a hospital.

353
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,520
But my ultimate piece of advice in regards to that?

354
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,520
Yes.

355
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,520
Freakin' have your midwife follow you everywhere you go.

356
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,520
And don't go to Walmart!

357
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:27,080
number six get it to the black market ASAP because the value of babies goes

358
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,960
down dramatically

359
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,000
right in the just stop just up alright

360
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,240
alright horrible person moving on actually I was going around passing this

361
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,280
around all my co-workers at work it was great

362
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:42,280
like half of them are pregnant let's let's continue on with the baby theme

363
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,600
but this is kind of a

364
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,040
this is just sick I really don't know how else to explain this but

365
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,080
I this is one of those things is going around on email

366
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,640
which kind of makes me question if it's even legit or not but you know it's

367
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,700
running on a lot of the big gaming website so I'm thinking that's got to be

368
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:02,860
legit but in Korea there's stories announced out there that there was a

369
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:07,020
mother and father who went to an internet cafe and they were playing

370
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:11,920
World of Warcraft and when they returned home they found their four-month-old

371
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:18,740
daughter who dead basically because they left the daughter alone of course the

372
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:22,340
couple has been booked on criminal charges the couple's defense by the way

373
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:27,020
we were thinking of playing for just an hour or two and returning home like

374
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:33,980
usual but the game took longer that day so they've done this before the infant

375
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:39,600
was the couple's only child thank God when I shot themselves in the ass for

376
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:47,000
that what's I deserve it no baby deserves it the baby the baby doesn't

377
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,780
deserve it but the parent sure as hell do I just uh it's just they were like

378
00:25:50,780 --> 00:26:00,660
I'd give my first born to make level 57 tonight see you can dress those cards

379
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:08,900
and letters to Loki I don't know it's sadly enough the story doesn't surprise

380
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:15,440
me because there's idiots in the world yeah in in in the United States in

381
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:22,000
Bolivia everywhere now there needs to be a standardized test before they let you breed if that was in the United States

382
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,040
It'd be the baby was dead in the car because they have the windows rolled up along with their dog

383
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,740
No comment from blizzard on that by the way, but

384
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:40,960
It's not their fault there you can bet somebody would there will be a parent's council out there in the world

385
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,560
Can I say that World of Warcraft causes babies to die?

386
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:50,360
Tell me there won't be this Parents Council for Freedom of Ameri- whatever, somewhere

387
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,720
that will say, World of Warcraft kills babies!

388
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,720
World of Warcraft!

389
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,720
I almost said World of Warcraft.

390
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,440
I honestly, I haven't spent serious time with World of Warcraft.

391
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,360
I can't judge it one way or the other, but Final Fantasy XI won't kill your babies.

392
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,520
It probably did kill some of these dogs somewhere.

393
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,960
You can play in windowed mode.

394
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,400
me there will not be somebody some parents counsel say World of Warcraft

395
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,280
kills babies and should be taken off store shelves it's poisoning our youth

396
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:25,120
dot dot dot I'm surprised people that you know never mind not gonna go there

397
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,160
yeah good idea how many babies died on EverQuest let's talk about something

398
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:33,080
when it leaves EverQuest can have babies let's talk about let's talk about Neopets

399
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,080
Ah! Mine are dead! Everybody loves Neopets, right?

400
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,080
I checked on mine and they're dead. Do your Neopets die now?

401
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,080
I couldn't get to my pets. I had a Neopet like five years ago, I think.

402
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,080
And now Iguana Girl has your Neopet. And I think it's dead now.

403
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,080
She adopted my Neopet like years ago. You had a Neopet once, right?

404
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,080
I had four Neopets. And they're all dead.

405
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,080
What did you do? Did you leave them alone while you went to play World of Warcraft?

406
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:01,080
I don't know. I just got bored with them because I couldn't access it from work anymore.

407
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,200
it from work anymore is it just me or did Neopets like slowly go downhill

408
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,280
over the years and you know since they got a video game and a trade in a

409
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:13,200
collectible card game and then you know I I remember walking by Claire's one day

410
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,320
I didn't go in there but I walked by it one day and there were selling Neopets

411
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,480
stuff and I'm just like I'm glad I plan is limited to me they're all the same

412
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,120
one of those girly store what stupid spoiled whores whatever those two

413
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:31,000
remember pogs yeah you remember Neopets no yeah see we pogs and Neopets

414
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,680
are in the same family here it is Neopets may not be as far away as you

415
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:41,640
think because MTV bought Neopets that's right MTV networks home of music

416
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:47,360
television haha but Neopets so that means that Neopets is gonna start

417
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,720
sucking even more or it will be something else maybe they can bring a

418
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:58,280
Neopets show to MTV so they can continue to not play music just a thought I

419
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,280
Already hate MTV

420
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:07,720
Do you want to get into why it's only except that they gave me a really really neat gorillas commercials, but apart from that

421
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,920
There's a lot. There's a lot of good things that have come from MTV remote control. Yeah, this is not on anymore

422
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,000
They're all from the 80 Adam Curry who is

423
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,200
The godfather of podcasting so we love you Adam Curry. Yeah

424
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,200
Just saying, not everything from MTV is bad, just everything in the past 10, 15 years.

425
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:33,200
I'm talking about currently, MTV is just degraded into this big festering pile of dog poopy.

426
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,200
Tell us how you really feel.

427
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:41,200
Okay, even more than being a big festering pile of dog poopy, they don't play music anymore.

428
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,200
The music they do play sucks, unless it's Gorillaz or Blur or Superfur animals.

429
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,200
They don't play Blur anymore.

430
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,200
They used to.

431
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,200
Well, not here in America.

432
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,200
Like, one song.

433
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,200
I know.

434
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,200
Anyway, moving on, moving on.

435
00:29:52,200 --> 00:30:00,200
another network Kids WB Kids WB will be getting 26 episodes of Viewtiful Joe

436
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:05,360
which will be coming onto the network in the fall two new Viewtiful Joe games are

437
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,100
on their way out by the way so honestly does this surprise anyone that has been

438
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:16,620
made in a cartoon so I don't stay up on the the animes so correct me it is an

439
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:21,280
anime it has been out for some time I downloaded the first couple episodes of

440
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:28,840
this like last year and it's on crack and kids WB is going to butcher it and

441
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:33,280
it would no longer retain its coolness now now now kids WB didn't butcher

442
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:38,720
Pokemon yeah yeah they did yeah they did yeah they did all right that's right I

443
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:44,880
used to watch Japanese and they and then you didn't see what they did I know I

444
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,880
can't believe kids WB took out all the strobing that was in that show and it

445
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:56,120
took out the boob scene the part where um I'm cold you know what was he in the

446
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:02,200
u.s. would not remember James yeah he was doing some modeling thing trying to

447
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,800
pretend trying to pass off as a woman so they could get another Pokemon and had

448
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,640
inflatable boobs and they took that episode out you know any of our

449
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,540
listeners that did get that reference are probably embarrassed to admit they

450
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:16,920
did and then they butchered Digimon cuz Digimon was cool are there any TV

451
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:24,080
networks you do like I like sci-fi they play Stargate and the food network for

452
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,360
Iron Chef well I don't have and I like court TV and the history channel and

453
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:32,160
biography alright so okay sorry I don't have a news story on any of those

454
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:37,280
channels but I do have a news story about g4 television for gamers yay g

455
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:43,880
like g4 for you has their nominees coming out for I'm sorry g4 has their

456
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:48,260
nominees coming out for G4ia which is going to be taking place live August no

457
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:52,260
I'm sorry it's July 27th but will be shown on August 9th so it's not really

458
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,640
live it's one of those tape delay things but whatever they're doing things a

459
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:00,440
little differently this year industry experts select the nominees the gamers

460
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,140
get to vote on them I guess it's probably through their website or

461
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:09,740
something so yeah so we get more low is it hmm we want to hear what some of the

462
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:12,820
industry experts picked when you hear some categories now I'm sure I'm sure

463
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:16,660
G4's website what are they G4TV.com I'm sure they have the big list of all the

464
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:20,500
games but we've got some of them I wanted to just share some of these

465
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:27,580
jazz jackrabbit best innovation Donkey Kong jungle beat feel the magic XY

466
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:32,860
xx katamari damashi full spectrum warrior and psi ops the mind gate

467
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:38,660
conspiracy okay okay this I ops is a good game why would feel the magic get a

468
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:42,540
a nomination because it's a ripoff of WarioWare and luminous doesn't

469
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:46,540
I don't but I don't know okay best original soundtrack

470
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:50,660
Katamari Damacy fable World of Warcraft

471
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:53,660
Halo 2 God of War now

472
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:56,780
granted all those games actually had really good soundtracks I can't I can't

473
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,540
argue with that especially Katamari Damacy

474
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:02,940
especially that one but for the types of games they were actually really enjoyed

475
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,060
fable soundtrack as well

476
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:07,220
there's another category for licensed soundtrack which luminous was in but

477
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,460
gonna win you know huh

478
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:11,360
halo's gonna win because everyone votes halo no matter what they could be like

479
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,980
best breakfast cereal halo can be a nominee up against Froot Loops or

480
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:19,820
something like that they'll be halo that's not cereal right Nintendo

481
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:25,380

grand theft auto san andreas who that's a toughie katamari damashi should be in

490
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:46,940
there

491
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:50,700
and maybe no no i disagree with

492
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,980
the entire list

493
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:55,860
the production values though for god of war you can't really

494
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,340
considering

495
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:01,260
the audience in mind and the gaming public as a general, we play a certain

496
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:04,020
niche of games. Taking the gaming public as a general,

497
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,240
I guess,

498
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:09,660
this list doesn't surprise me at all. This honestly seems like a

499
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:15,300
fair representation. I bet these experts were like the lunchtime poll in Heathers.

500
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:19,100
If the world was going to explode tomorrow and you had six million dollars today,

501
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,580
what would you do with it?

502
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,100
I'd go buy me Halo 2.

503
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:27,100
would have liked to have seen like a little like a niche title a black horse

504
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:32,140
candidate if you will like Katamari Damacy or luminous or something but

505
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:38,180
didn't happen what can you say so check that out if you want to it's over on g4

506
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:43,420
guitar hero that's the new game coming out harmonics is teaming up with red

507
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:46,900
octane it looks like a cross between karaoke revolution guitar freaks some

508
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,820
songs some songs have been announced and you know how they kind of did like cover

509
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:54,380
songs in karaoke revolution well it's gonna be the same deal they're gonna do

510
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:58,100
cover songs and guitar hero but the covers and karaoke revolution weren't

511
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:01,980
bad I've definitely heard worse they weren't bad so this should be

512
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,980
interesting the guitar hero here's some of the songs are gonna be in it red hot

513
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:10,260
chili peppers with higher ground Boston more than a feelin mega death symphony

514
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:15,500

the stone age no one knows David Bowie Ziggy Stardust dated France Ferdinand

517
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:33,740
take me out deep purple smoke on the water cream crossroads some 41 you had

518
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:38,460
me at David Bowie I love Ziggy Stardust very I kind of like the direction

519
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,600
they're going with this because it got a lot of like classic guitar blended with

520
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,920
the newer bands that are known for guitars style of play that makes me

521
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,660
think of that Johnny whatever on the gizmondo a little bit know what I love

522
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,140
and they should have put it in there. It's aerodynamical.

523
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:56,020
Well this is just partial. It's just partial. Daft Punk.

524
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,060
That has one hell of a guitar solo in it. We'll see.

525
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:02,480
Somebody brought this up a little earlier in the show but I just want to clarify the

526
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,660
Revolution, Nintendo Revolution,

527
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:09,180
there was a report over on Joystick.com, that's with a Q.

528
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:14,260
Joystick.com is reporting that they will be getting a graphical

529
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,700
upgrade. Remember how

530
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:23,720
And they announced we months ago that Nintendo and Super Nintendo titles all the way up through 64 titles

531
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,960
Will be downloadable through the revolution. They're gonna get a graphical upgrade of some sort is now what they're saying now

532
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,960
If it's gonna be new sprites

533
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:36,520
like they did like think Mario all-stars got new sprites or if it's gonna be more like

534
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:42,900
Emulation and you look at emulators and how like if you play I don't know say like eat Kid Icarus or something

535
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:48,360
it's smooth you know what keeps popping through my head in the Satellaview hmm

536
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:52,660
which was we didn't get it over here but it was like a download system where you

537
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:56,660
could you can actually download the ROMs for it now the upgraded Zelda for

538
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:01,340
Satellaview there were a bunch of different games but they were all

539
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:05,740
downloadable you could play them for a time limit and then okay okay now I

540
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:09,220
can't see them going back and reskinning all their old games so I don't think

541
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:12,300
it's that although maybe for some of them it will be because like we were

542
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:16,280
saying earlier in the show why would you pay to download this stuff when you can

543
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,800
emulate it for free well maybe that's a big incentive you know to play Kid

544
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,360
Icarus with like really nice you know Super Nintendo or even better graphics

545
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:27,320
I'd pay for that I really would I would I just want a freaking sequel to that

546
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:32,840
game that's all is that too much to ask I had to be asked what the code was for

547
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:38,320
Kid Icarus by the way Icarus fights Medusa angels can't you also do Medusa

548
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,600
fights Icarus angels and it's like a different I thought you could I'll try

549
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,280
I haven't think you can flip it and you get something else. It's been a it's been a while

550
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:50,680
I don't I don't cheat on games terror danger horror exclamation point. That was the other one

551
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,280
This story I think is very interesting

552
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,440
You know how you can buy things on MMOs like with real money and eBay and saying it's kind of controversial

553
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,440
Does it ruin the game doesn't not that it?

554
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:09,040
Well, there is a report and I actually picked this up off a slashdot earlier this week

555
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:14,720
they're running a story about game pal and game pal what it does is it allows

556
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,480
you to rent a character in an online world so I think it might be a play on

557
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,480
the term game fly because you know how like that's a rental service well game

558
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:28,800
pal for just a $300 deposit and for $150 for the first month and 130 for each

559
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:34,160
month after that you can have your choice of up to 50 accounts one of 50

560
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:40,400
accounts for 14 popular MMOs, Star Wars Galaxies, Ultima Online, EverQuest, City of

561
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,240
Heroes, but the trick is is that when you're renting these characters you're

562
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,440
renting God characters you're renting the highest they go so you know maximum

563
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:54,840
level all the good gear what do you think? Is this a practical idea or is it a

564
00:38:54,840 --> 00:39:00,880
big joke? Pisses me off like for example on Ragnarok I put in what two and a half

565
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,760
years into my character to get her to level 70 something and then it would

566
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,200
just piss me off to see someone come in with a level 100 character right off the

567
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,400
bat it's ridiculous it's interesting because they're renting these characters

568
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,000
not selling them they're renting them and they should charge even more the

569
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,480
prices are a little weird they should Jack those prices even more make him

570
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,600
pay for that privilege Loki I know you've openly admitted to you don't care

571
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,800
buy your money online I think it's stupid really kind of money for that

572
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,680
an idiot would honestly you know for that kind of money you could be buying a

573
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,840
lot of you know online currency and you know get your character maxed anyways

574
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,880
hell I'd be almost tempted to see you know what that deposit was for in the

575
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:44,320
first place otherwise it just rent a god character and accidentally send all my

576
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:49,840
stuff to someone else you know and money you could actually buy groceries for two

577
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:53,240
weeks you can use that as a car payment feature

578
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:58,120
you get a babysitter for your baby when you go out to you know you know god

579
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:03,480
damn it people live in the real fucking world okay games are fine every now and

580
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:07,520
again but keep in mind that your money you know you should use it responsibly

581
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,960
or else you're gonna end up like one of those losers whose baby died you'll be a

582
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:16,360
loser not a winner but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't play your games at

583
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:20,120
all another World of Warcraft story I have for you guys they're getting an

584
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,200
expansion pack and that's pretty much all I have to say there's really

585
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,200
a whole lot of news besides that they announced that they're making an expansion pack that's

586
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:33,680
kind of the done news of the week you know wow over two million people you're a dork

587
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:40,160
over two million people on this mmo you think we might do an expansion or 12 yeah i'll stick

588
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:46,160
with pso thank you until right mark 2 comes out i'm still curious about wow i i'm i'm just i'm

589
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,600
taking a break from mmo's in general right now i'm kind of burnt on them but i think when i

590
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,640
I come back, I will check out well. I still think you should play PSO with me. I'm on

591
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:58,040
a break. I'm on a break. I will pay for you a month to play PSO with me. We'll see.

592
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,840
I need people to play with. I can't say anything against free stuff, we'll see. Alright, one

593
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:08,960
last story for you guys tonight. You know Happy Tree Friends? Yeah, these were the shorts

594
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,700
they used to show at Spike and Mike, Sick and Twisted, where they had these cute, lovable

595
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:18,560
furry animals and they kill each other senseless. They gouge out eyeballs and all this stuff.

596
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:23,040
So what more would be perfect for Happy Tree Friends than for them to get their own video

597
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,040
game?

598
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,840
It's happening.

599
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:30,600
Brad Young, chief executive of Flashman Studios, says it's an almost perfect brand for video

600
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,600
games.

601
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:36,240
The simple, cute, and hugely appealing graphical style combined with a very dark, clever humor

602
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,880
and the cartoon violence provides a wonderful opportunity for the video games market to

603
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,360
tap into a huge global fan base.

604
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,960
Might I add, I hope this turns out better than Clay Fighters.

605
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,960
That's all.

606
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:53,320
clay fighters it was all about Helga I thought clay fight a blob it was one of

607
00:41:53,320 --> 00:42:00,920
those one one trick games no it was all about who was this mr. frosty did I love

608
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:07,820
clay fight because I had Street Fighter 2 which was much better today and I had

609
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:13,120
play fight it was all about c2 Loki you're awfully quiet but you you were

610
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,640
the first one to show me a DVD full of these things and some of these I

611
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,120
actually cringed at some of these cartoons it takes a lot to gross me out

612
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:25,240
but some of these are nasty it's just building off the popularity of conquered

613
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:30,400
live and reloaded it's really all that I seem to recall that g4 was running these

614
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,600
in some capacity yeah they're on their attack of the show show that's on their

615
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:41,560
network and it's kind of like oh look at us we're hip and yeah they do like they

616
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,640
show like popular clips from the weapons and it doesn't surprise me so it's just

617
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:49,720
it's just you know thing let's jump on board this now you know what you know

618
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:56,640
how many years sellout train we would hop on it too how late are they well

619

guys to support final thoughts from those of us in studio Loki that was

631
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:04,200
funny is this morning there was actually a 4.8 earthquake going on while I was

632
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:09,900
playing destroy all humans and so so I was sitting there you know playing my

633
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:13,200
game and all sudden I feel the ground under me roll I'm like damn this is a

634
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,700
realistic game the the earthquake happened while my roommate was playing

635
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:26,660
DDR and he's a stomper so I just thought it was DDR no I didn't feel anything no

636
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:31,320
I was upstairs though it's 4.8 earthquake it was in like around Tahoe

637
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:35,460
our international audience could care less about some little quick. The first

638
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:41,220
earthquake I ever felt though was in Alabama. A tremor off the coast. Not a state known for their

639
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:45,180
earthquakes. It was a tremor off coast. Alright, your final thought DarkSakura. My

640
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:52,680
final thought, reject boss icons because I said so. And my final thought is I want

641
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:58,680
candy so I'm gonna go get it. I want candy. Thank you guys very much. Have a great week. We'll see
