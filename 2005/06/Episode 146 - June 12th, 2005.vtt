[SPEAKER_22]: Someone keyed my new car.

08:29.787 --> 08:30.207
[SPEAKER_22]: What?

08:31.108 --> 08:34.871
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I don't know if it's already there, but it's very hard to tell because my car is silver.

08:35.351 --> 08:35.491
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-huh.

08:35.692 --> 08:38.194
[SPEAKER_22]: So it doesn't show up as glaringly as it would on any other color.

08:38.814 --> 08:39.154
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh.

08:39.174 --> 08:42.958
[SPEAKER_22]: But I noticed it, I was like, the light is reflecting in a funny way.

08:42.978 --> 08:43.298
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh-huh.

08:44.150 --> 08:54.361
[SPEAKER_22]: I got your car, and my car kicks everybody's ass twice, and several times on Sunday, and then, like, just fucks all that shit up.

08:55.883 --> 08:57.745
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm sure we'll be hearing more about that later.

08:57.825 --> 09:00.628
[SPEAKER_11]: Also joining us tonight, say hello to TechMassaLoki.

09:00.648 --> 09:01.890
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

09:03.391 --> 09:04.712
[SPEAKER_11]: I finished my pizza.

09:04.932 --> 09:06.293
[SPEAKER_11]: You finished your pizza and breadsticks tonight.

09:06.613 --> 09:09.094
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry about the little hiccup there in the beginning, boys and girls.

09:09.655 --> 09:15.718
[SPEAKER_11]: We accidentally had a router mishap, and so something came unplugged during the intro there.

09:15.738 --> 09:16.638
[SPEAKER_11]: We cut the wrong wire.

09:18.119 --> 09:26.304
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, basically, we accidentally cut the wire that would blow everything up, because you know how in the movies... It's like you press the red button in Maniac Mansion in the pool.

09:28.812 --> 09:33.255
[SPEAKER_11]: Or for those that didn't play through that game, which would be a lot of our audience, because that game is kind of old.

09:33.455 --> 09:40.599
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd always get just fed up and purposefully find the pool, drain it, because the pool cooled the nuclear reactor, and pressing the button made it explode.

09:40.619 --> 09:45.142
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish they would release that TV show on DVD or something, because I totally miss the TV show.

09:45.402 --> 09:46.703
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, anyway, my analogy.

09:46.983 --> 09:52.767
[SPEAKER_11]: You know how in the movies they always have the green wire and the red wire, and you have to cut the right wire or everything will blow up?

09:53.227 --> 09:56.609
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we accidentally cut the wire that blew everything up, so...

09:57.625 --> 10:25.704
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, anyway Moving on We are back, hello We got a fun show for you guys tonight We even have a very special guest here tonight But he'll introduce himself after the first break Because we don't have all our listeners back yet We had a mishap Yeah, so we'll be back So let's go to a break and when we come back we'll get to the show As I mentioned in the opening there We are going to debut an Ultramix 3 song A brand new song here on the show

10:26.425 --> 10:27.166
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's cool.

10:27.506 --> 10:31.691
[SPEAKER_11]: And the thing is, is that it's already been out there on the internet, just nobody found it yet.

10:31.831 --> 10:32.292
[SPEAKER_11]: But we did.

10:32.712 --> 10:35.435
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to unveil it for the rest of you guys.

10:35.475 --> 10:41.001
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to point at the pink elephant in the room tonight and say, look, Ultramix 3 song, right over there.

10:41.201 --> 10:43.804
[SPEAKER_07]: There'll be also some more crapper debuting, too.

10:44.245 --> 10:44.645
[SPEAKER_07]: Like what?

10:45.206 --> 10:45.406
[SPEAKER_07]: Well...

10:46.061 --> 10:47.922
[SPEAKER_07]: What's it say on the CD here?

10:48.082 --> 10:51.363
[SPEAKER_07]: There's two songs on there, and what are they... Interesting.

10:51.863 --> 10:53.303
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I supposed to say now or later?

10:53.423 --> 11:03.647
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll say it later, but there's two songs on there that have remixes to them now, and they're okay, but they'll never be released on the internet because they're B-sides.

11:03.847 --> 11:05.747
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so tonight's the only time you'll hear them then?

11:05.967 --> 11:06.448
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, maybe.

11:06.708 --> 11:06.988
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

11:07.907 --> 11:09.007
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go into this break.

11:09.047 --> 11:12.308
[SPEAKER_11]: In this first break, we're going to hear some music from DDR Ultramix 2.

11:12.948 --> 11:18.729
[SPEAKER_11]: Starting off with a song we were the first to blow the lid off of last year, about a year ago this time, so here it is.

11:19.429 --> 11:25.371
[SPEAKER_11]: For those of you guys that are trying to get your friends in to listen, because we are going to be announcing that new song and playing the new song, we have it.

11:25.691 --> 11:28.071
[SPEAKER_11]: We found a copy of it out there, so we're going to play the new song for you guys.

11:28.451 --> 11:30.132
[SPEAKER_11]: That should be about 7.45, 8 o'clock-ish.

11:32.532 --> 11:33.052
[SPEAKER_11]: Just so you know.

11:33.113 --> 11:35.595
[SPEAKER_11]: But don't just tune out and then tune back in then.

11:35.615 --> 11:38.437
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we've got loads of fun for you guys tonight.

11:38.517 --> 11:41.739
[SPEAKER_11]: Cage match and stuff going on within the groove as well.

11:42.280 --> 11:45.002
[SPEAKER_11]: And all the stuff you know and love here at Orange Lounge Radio.

11:45.022 --> 11:46.043
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll be back after this.

12:00.954 --> 12:27.898
[SPEAKER_20]: Tone poem dreams, alpha perfection, so very hard to reach Harmony machine, tormenting the sensory Deliciously evolved, and yet nobody knows Tittle tattle, chicken chat, shoots in the breeze Platter, clack, hate and splatter, there's a vagraness in me

Thank you for watching!

13:52.235 --> 13:53.372
Thank you for watching!

14:22.759 --> 14:26.027
[SPEAKER_20]: Let me tell you something you don't know

15:56.005 --> 16:12.134
I was picked up for a TV show It's called A24 I am the girl that you all know To love, hate or adore I've been waiting all my life Just to be seen Seen by everyone I wanted to be someone

19:08.362 --> 19:16.929
[SPEAKER_31]: Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter D, the letter A, and the number 59.

19:16.969 --> 19:22.933
[SPEAKER_20]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

19:24.234 --> 19:32.701
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 146, off to a very interesting start tonight.

19:33.635 --> 19:37.797
[SPEAKER_11]: with some stuff going on there in the opening where we kind of disconnected there for a little bit.

19:38.177 --> 19:41.538
[SPEAKER_11]: And now folks in the chatroom are saying they heard skips there in the last break.

19:41.758 --> 19:42.859
[SPEAKER_11]: I have no idea what that's about.

19:42.939 --> 19:46.700
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't show anything going on on our end, but I have no idea.

19:47.580 --> 19:48.861
[SPEAKER_11]: So hopefully everything's okay.

19:50.842 --> 19:54.623
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, tonight we are going to play a brand new song from Ultramix 3 for you guys.

19:55.623 --> 20:00.425
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably in about... I don't know, probably about a little over an hour from now.

20:01.626 --> 20:02.246
[SPEAKER_11]: In the meantime...

20:02.881 --> 20:05.423
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

20:25.794 --> 20:27.537
[SPEAKER_11]: So back at the old Konami now?

20:27.737 --> 20:28.519
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

20:29.100 --> 20:29.680
[SPEAKER_11]: How's it going?

20:30.101 --> 20:30.682
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty good.

20:32.665 --> 20:34.468
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's all I can say about that.

20:35.029 --> 20:35.510
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.

20:35.610 --> 20:37.874
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't really say anything, can you?

20:38.114 --> 20:39.156
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I can't.

20:39.456 --> 20:39.997
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a bummer.

20:40.714 --> 20:44.515
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you gotten to at least see the new stuff that we're all excited about?

20:44.795 --> 20:45.355
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

20:45.455 --> 20:47.016
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little thing called NDA.

20:47.356 --> 20:48.556
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, you can't even say that.

20:48.576 --> 20:49.776
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think I can say that.

20:50.457 --> 20:52.077
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well, that's too bad.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.057
[SPEAKER_11]: Which means that's a... What?

20:54.658 --> 20:55.958
[SPEAKER_07]: That means yes, he has.

20:56.598 --> 20:58.078
[SPEAKER_07]: That's exactly what that means.

20:58.138 --> 20:58.739
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that no meaning yes?

20:58.759 --> 21:03.060
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it would have been a no, otherwise, not, I can't talk about that.

21:03.140 --> 21:07.461
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, let's use some reverse psychology to figure out some more stuff here.

21:08.001 --> 21:10.122
[SPEAKER_06]: So every time I answer NDA, that means yes?

21:15.985 --> 21:19.306
[SPEAKER_11]: Was somebody smoking crack when they put Butterfly on Ultramix 3?

21:20.727 --> 21:21.267
[SPEAKER_11]: NDA.

21:22.328 --> 21:23.328
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, just curious.

21:24.669 --> 21:30.912
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, also I have to point out is that because we are disclosing a new song tonight,

21:31.252 --> 21:35.436
[SPEAKER_11]: This has nothing to do with the coincidence that Miklatov is here because he is under an NDA.

21:35.576 --> 21:39.759
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I didn't know about this until yesterday that you even knew about the song.

21:39.819 --> 21:40.740
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

21:40.960 --> 21:48.866
[SPEAKER_11]: As you will find out when we reveal the song, you'll find out why we're revealing the song and it will make sense how all the cards kind of fell into place.

21:48.927 --> 21:50.748
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll kind of get to that when we talk about the song.

21:51.288 --> 21:52.069
[SPEAKER_11]: GamePro again!

21:53.490 --> 21:57.013
[SPEAKER_11]: It actually was not GamePro, funny enough, but it was an internet website that spilled it.

21:57.153 --> 21:57.914
[SPEAKER_11]: I will say that much.

21:59.658 --> 22:04.600
[SPEAKER_06]: And it wasn't a DDR-related website, so it's just... It's a website.

22:04.660 --> 22:05.221
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a website.

22:05.241 --> 22:06.841
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, so we'll get to that a little later.

22:08.662 --> 22:13.304
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to get to that, but first we've got to start off the show with a little bit of how was your week, how was your day?

22:13.564 --> 22:17.206
[SPEAKER_11]: And DarkSakura, I know you're dying to tell us all about the new vehicle.

22:17.226 --> 22:18.567
[SPEAKER_11]: So how was your week, how was your day?

22:18.707 --> 22:20.688
[SPEAKER_22]: The rest of my week I could give a rat's ass about.

22:22.168 --> 22:27.251
[SPEAKER_22]: We went on Friday to one of the Mitsubishi dealerships in town because I had settled on getting a Lancer.

22:28.471 --> 22:52.996
[SPEAKER_22]: and they gave us a good deal on a not too exciting 2004, you know, it only had like 5,000 miles on it, so it was really good, it had all the options, everything else, like, okay, this is nice, and then we went to Fairfield, and they had a 2002 Lancer OZ Rally Edition, which is what I wanted, and the thing about it is that this

22:54.995 --> 23:18.776
[SPEAKER_22]: has, is basically, when I think Lancer, this is the car I think of, it has the logo and wide letters across the back instead of just eensy tiny at the bottom of the trunk, and has the, the, you know, the custom rims for the, for that model, has all the bells and whistles, it's automatic on top of it, we did look at an evolution, and there's no way I could ever fucking afford that car.

23:19.977 --> 23:26.600
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, I also got a warranty on it that's basically the warranty for a brand new car on a 2002 model.

23:26.660 --> 23:29.901
[SPEAKER_22]: So basically, I have an old car with a brand new warranty on it.

23:30.742 --> 23:31.962
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's fabulous.

23:32.022 --> 23:32.562
[SPEAKER_22]: It's silver.

23:32.662 --> 23:36.284
[SPEAKER_22]: It only has a little ding on the fender, and then I found the scratch on the door.

23:37.284 --> 23:38.105
[SPEAKER_22]: But it's fast.

23:39.165 --> 23:43.667
[SPEAKER_22]: It goes from zero to 60 in less than three seconds.

23:43.707 --> 23:45.388
[SPEAKER_22]: How fast have you taken it so far?

23:46.308 --> 23:47.108
[SPEAKER_22]: Ben took it to 95.

23:50.225 --> 23:52.867
[SPEAKER_22]: He got challenged on Roosevelt Road driving my car last night.

23:53.107 --> 23:53.648
[SPEAKER_11]: To a race?

23:53.908 --> 23:54.568
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, to a race.

23:55.049 --> 23:58.351
[SPEAKER_22]: He passed some Civic, and he just swooped right down in front of him.

23:58.811 --> 24:01.733
[SPEAKER_22]: And so the guy in the Civic started flashing his lights like he wanted to race.

24:02.554 --> 24:03.874
[SPEAKER_22]: And then pulled up in the lane beside him.

24:05.456 --> 24:08.558
[SPEAKER_22]: Dan said he might have done it, but I would have had his balls for breakfast.

24:09.499 --> 24:11.040
[SPEAKER_22]: Or at least would have fed it to him for breakfast.

24:11.741 --> 24:13.022
[SPEAKER_10]: So, good boy.

24:13.162 --> 24:15.104
[SPEAKER_10]: Tie the car around a tree the first day out.

24:15.144 --> 24:15.925
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a great idea.

24:15.985 --> 24:21.409
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, especially since from that area, Roosevelt Road goes to one lane.

24:22.150 --> 24:23.471
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, not smart.

24:26.254 --> 24:27.315
[SPEAKER_22]: My week has been car.

24:28.075 --> 24:28.936
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh yeah, and I got an iPod.

24:29.456 --> 24:29.837
[SPEAKER_22]: It was free.

24:31.009 --> 24:32.911
[SPEAKER_11]: So the free iPod site actually worked?

24:33.231 --> 24:33.511
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

24:33.591 --> 24:36.553
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there an engraving on the thing that says freeipods.com or whatever?

24:36.693 --> 24:37.854
[SPEAKER_22]: No, it's just an iPod.

24:38.154 --> 24:38.554
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

24:38.754 --> 24:39.255
[SPEAKER_11]: How many gigs?

24:40.055 --> 24:39.255
20.

24:40.555 --> 24:40.896
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

24:41.116 --> 24:42.136
[SPEAKER_22]: And in FM tuner now.

24:42.356 --> 24:43.497
[SPEAKER_11]: How much have you filled it up already?

24:44.037 --> 24:44.238
[SPEAKER_22]: About 10.

24:45.649 --> 24:53.120
[SPEAKER_22]: And I have a 28 gigabyte collection, so I was taking off all the stuff that I never listen to but play for other people.

24:54.062 --> 24:54.362
[SPEAKER_11]: Right on.

24:54.502 --> 24:57.166
[SPEAKER_22]: Like, none of my Bimani music is in it except for all my Taku stuff.

24:57.207 --> 24:57.827
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what's interesting?

24:57.888 --> 24:59.550
[SPEAKER_11]: None of my Bimani music is in my iPod either.

24:59.570 --> 25:01.253
[SPEAKER_22]: I have some of the long versions.

25:02.074 --> 25:02.654
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, me too.

25:02.714 --> 25:04.315
[SPEAKER_11]: I have, like, some long versions.

25:04.375 --> 25:07.656
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I have Conga Feelin' in there, because you have to have Conga Feelin', obviously.

25:08.876 --> 25:09.516
[SPEAKER_11]: And very few others.

25:09.556 --> 25:14.237
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a couple Loki remixes, funny enough, which are, you know, somewhat Bomani-related, I suppose.

25:14.477 --> 25:18.998
[SPEAKER_22]: Celica only goes to 101.

25:19.239 --> 25:21.959
[SPEAKER_22]: He only took the car that fast just because of the road.

25:22.459 --> 25:23.540
[SPEAKER_22]: My car will top out at 100.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.541
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, the guy at the dealership said he got it going at 130.

25:29.577 --> 25:30.317
[SPEAKER_22]: and still had room.

25:31.598 --> 25:33.859
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm just making a promise in the chat room.

25:33.899 --> 25:34.560
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting comment.

25:34.580 --> 25:37.822
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of our chat room, why don't you join at www.orangelandredo.com.

25:37.862 --> 25:38.482
[SPEAKER_11]: Click on chat.

25:38.502 --> 25:39.943
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got a lot of interesting folks in there.

25:40.943 --> 25:44.465
[SPEAKER_11]: Sephiroth1215 says, I'm thinking about doing the free Xbox 360.

25:44.525 --> 25:46.346
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you think about that?

25:46.426 --> 25:53.210
[SPEAKER_11]: Now that you have reaped the rewards of one of these free iPod.com sites, what do you think of other free stuff?

25:53.250 --> 25:56.052
[SPEAKER_22]: First of all, the Xbox 360 isn't going to be out for months.

25:57.700 --> 26:02.764
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why I think it's weird that there's already all these banner ads for win a free PlayStation 3.

26:03.404 --> 26:06.567
[SPEAKER_22]: The thing is, look at what type of offers they have.

26:06.667 --> 26:11.632
[SPEAKER_22]: I did the Blockbuster one because you have to sign up for an offer and you have to get five more people to do it.

26:12.172 --> 26:13.613
[SPEAKER_22]: I signed up for the Blockbuster one.

26:14.594 --> 26:16.756
[SPEAKER_22]: It had a two week trial on it.

26:17.016 --> 26:18.558
[SPEAKER_22]: It takes them five days.

26:19.537 --> 26:24.840
[SPEAKER_22]: To confirm, they do not bill you until your free trial is up, and you can cancel within your free trial.

26:25.801 --> 26:28.102
[SPEAKER_22]: So I waited until it confirmed, and I canceled it.

26:29.063 --> 26:29.763
[SPEAKER_22]: No money lost.

26:30.704 --> 26:32.505
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what a lot of people do.

26:32.645 --> 26:35.086
[SPEAKER_11]: So people wonder how do they make money off this.

26:35.186 --> 26:41.110
[SPEAKER_22]: Keep in mind as well that you're putting a lot of your shipping, your address, all that stuff on those sites that you're doing the offers for.

26:41.710 --> 26:43.031
[SPEAKER_22]: They will sell your information.

26:43.496 --> 26:44.657
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, absolutely.

26:44.857 --> 26:47.238
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I actually got, and they'll spam your email box.

26:47.818 --> 26:52.121
[SPEAKER_22]: So you have to, you know, basically get their physical address and send them an affidavit.

26:52.221 --> 26:54.422
[SPEAKER_22]: Do not sell my information.

26:54.582 --> 26:55.543
[SPEAKER_22]: Opt out of any sharing.

26:55.563 --> 26:57.184
[SPEAKER_22]: Because under privacy law, they have to do it.

26:57.624 --> 26:57.824
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

26:58.484 --> 27:02.547
[SPEAKER_11]: But, or just move on them, which is something you're going to be doing soon anyway, right?

27:02.567 --> 27:03.207
[SPEAKER_22]: Boarding addresses.

27:04.348 --> 27:05.028
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I guess that's true.

27:05.822 --> 27:06.822
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, the junk mail finds you.

27:07.683 --> 27:14.225
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a way that when you put out your forwarding address, except for iPodFreeStuff.com or whatever site you use?

27:14.865 --> 27:14.985
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

27:15.125 --> 27:15.625
[SPEAKER_11]: That's too bad.

27:16.346 --> 27:21.247
[SPEAKER_22]: Although what I do want to do is take the junk mail one day and just put a big return to sender stamp on it.

27:23.608 --> 27:24.288
[SPEAKER_22]: Does it really work?

27:25.189 --> 27:25.929
[SPEAKER_22]: I haven't tried it yet.

27:26.669 --> 27:31.971
[SPEAKER_22]: Or, one thing, there's free offer things, you know, sign up for this credit card.

27:32.731 --> 27:36.212
[SPEAKER_22]: I used to chop up their offer and put it in the envelope and mail it back to them.

27:38.873 --> 27:39.493
[SPEAKER_11]: That's great.

27:40.414 --> 27:41.234
[SPEAKER_11]: Do they still send them to you?

27:41.816 --> 27:44.298
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to write deceased on mine.

27:46.119 --> 27:46.760
[SPEAKER_07]: You used to write what?

27:47.040 --> 27:48.661
[SPEAKER_07]: Deceased.

27:50.403 --> 27:51.704
[SPEAKER_11]: I stopped getting those offers.

27:52.524 --> 27:56.567
[SPEAKER_11]: I used to send them fingers, but then they started showing up in chili bowls, so I had to stop doing that.

27:59.329 --> 28:00.230
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not paid to be funny.

28:00.951 --> 28:02.112
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything else you want to share about your week?

28:02.712 --> 28:03.773
[SPEAKER_22]: You're not paid at all.

28:04.383 --> 28:05.704
[SPEAKER_11]: We do this out of love and ego

28:32.156 --> 28:36.839
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, aren't you worried about the Miklatov fan club like assaulting you at SVGL now that you've said that?

28:37.540 --> 28:39.801
[SPEAKER_06]: No, because I don't have a fan club.

28:40.442 --> 28:41.863
[SPEAKER_06]: I have haters.

28:42.523 --> 28:43.264
[SPEAKER_11]: You have haters?

28:43.324 --> 28:43.704
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

28:43.764 --> 28:44.585
[SPEAKER_11]: Why do you have haters?

28:44.605 --> 28:45.225
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I'm a jerk.

28:45.605 --> 28:46.446
[SPEAKER_11]: You're a jerk.

28:46.706 --> 28:48.307
[SPEAKER_11]: You are, but I mean, you know.

28:49.648 --> 28:53.531
[SPEAKER_06]: People still bring up the whole last year with the extreme thread how...

28:54.065 --> 28:55.746
[SPEAKER_06]: We gave them not real clues.

28:56.766 --> 28:57.367
[SPEAKER_06]: But that was funny.

28:59.147 --> 29:02.589
[SPEAKER_11]: Which would be even funnier if you guys don't give them any clues this year.

29:02.649 --> 29:03.970
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be hilarious.

29:03.990 --> 29:05.891
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be hilarious.

29:06.471 --> 29:06.851
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

29:06.891 --> 29:08.112
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I just said that.

29:08.132 --> 29:08.692
[SPEAKER_06]: That was my week.

29:08.912 --> 29:11.353
[SPEAKER_06]: And then yesterday I got really drunk.

29:11.973 --> 29:13.274
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was on the floor a lot.

29:13.334 --> 29:13.994
[SPEAKER_06]: Were you dunked?

29:14.615 --> 29:15.735
[SPEAKER_06]: I was so dunked.

29:16.155 --> 29:18.176
[SPEAKER_06]: At one point I think I asked if I was black.

29:20.983 --> 29:23.859
[SPEAKER_11]: For the record, boys and girls, Mikhail Tav is not black.

29:24.936 --> 29:31.298
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, and I was on the floor a whole lot, and played drinking games, and it was fun.

29:31.918 --> 29:34.999
[SPEAKER_06]: Except for the pain of my stomach with the alcohol.

29:35.260 --> 29:38.741
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, yeah, I haven't done much.

29:40.081 --> 29:42.542
[SPEAKER_06]: I kinda, oh, I picked up a Blue DS!

29:42.882 --> 29:44.223
[SPEAKER_06]: That's hot, because it's blue.

29:45.163 --> 29:47.824
[SPEAKER_06]: And now I have to get Nintendogs for it, because Nintendogs is fun.

29:47.844 --> 29:48.784
[SPEAKER_11]: Because of the puppies!

29:48.884 --> 29:49.284
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

29:49.304 --> 29:51.025
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to tell the ball story, though.

29:52.076 --> 29:54.738
[SPEAKER_11]: because I got so much exercise in the mall today because of you.

29:54.838 --> 29:55.079
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

29:55.279 --> 30:00.063
[SPEAKER_06]: So EB has this promotion going on where you buy a DS and get Mario free.

30:00.424 --> 30:04.307
[SPEAKER_06]: So we went to EB in the mall, which was on the other side of the mall from where we parked.

30:05.028 --> 30:07.430
[SPEAKER_06]: Get there, I'm like, hey, I want a blue DS with free Mario.

30:07.450 --> 30:08.391
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't have Mario.

30:09.852 --> 30:11.774
[SPEAKER_06]: I was kind of sad, and I was like, okay, I'll just buy it.

30:12.274 --> 30:16.218
[SPEAKER_06]: So I take an ad just because I wanted to look at it, and I bought the DS.

30:16.818 --> 30:19.060
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, maybe GameStop will match the ad.

30:19.120 --> 30:20.441
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's on the other side of the mall.

30:20.521 --> 30:22.002
[SPEAKER_06]: So we go to the other side of the mall.

30:22.382 --> 30:24.023
[SPEAKER_06]: I still have my blue DS from EB.

30:24.143 --> 30:24.724
[SPEAKER_06]: Go in there.

30:25.364 --> 30:27.986
[SPEAKER_06]: I ask if they will match the ad.

30:28.006 --> 30:30.408
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like, yeah, if you have the ad with you, which I did.

30:31.429 --> 30:35.512
[SPEAKER_06]: But I had this blue DS that I had to go take back to EB first to get the money back for.

30:36.312 --> 30:43.358
[SPEAKER_06]: So we walked to the other side of the mall again to EB, talked to the guy, tell him that I want my free games, so I'm going to go to GameStop.

30:43.378 --> 30:44.159
[SPEAKER_06]: He was cool about it.

30:44.499 --> 30:50.144
[SPEAKER_06]: And we walked to the other side of the mall, to GameStop, to get my Blue DS and my free Mario.

30:50.224 --> 30:56.089
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I wanted a USB cable as well, but they were all $15, and they came with software I didn't need.

30:56.349 --> 31:00.753
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have one back in Kansas that's like a $5 one, but it's back in Kansas.

31:02.294 --> 31:03.535
[SPEAKER_22]: I could have given you one for free.

31:04.809 --> 31:05.712
[SPEAKER_06]: I got one for free now.

31:07.538 --> 31:09.384
[SPEAKER_06]: That was it.

31:11.690 --> 31:13.692
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, yeah, I got a lot of exercise in the mall today, thanks.

31:13.792 --> 31:16.254
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and there are these little skanks that were performing.

31:16.474 --> 31:18.156
[SPEAKER_06]: They were seven years old.

31:18.276 --> 31:21.839
[SPEAKER_06]: They looked like they were performing to become future strippers, is what it was.

31:22.479 --> 31:23.140
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was great.

31:24.161 --> 31:26.002
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a lot of pedophiles there, you could tell.

31:26.723 --> 31:34.089
[SPEAKER_11]: What was great is at the mall here, they have one of those local news stations that does their live broadcast from the mall or whatever.

31:34.169 --> 31:39.894
[SPEAKER_11]: So right next to that is one of those stores where little girls can go and buy accessories.

31:40.216 --> 31:42.200
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, it's not Claire's, but it's some other store.

31:42.240 --> 31:43.663
[SPEAKER_11]: They learn how to make jewelry and stuff.

31:44.404 --> 31:48.933
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, like, stupid spoiled whore or something is the store.

31:48.953 --> 31:49.253
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

31:49.892 --> 31:53.675
[SPEAKER_22]: All those old guys were just standing there watching and it was great.

32:17.305 --> 32:19.206
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see here.

32:19.226 --> 32:19.206
777.

32:19.246 --> 32:20.107
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, that's 21!

32:20.627 --> 32:20.967
[SPEAKER_11]: Legal!

32:22.228 --> 32:23.529
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

32:23.549 --> 32:23.529
777.

32:23.569 --> 32:24.389
[SPEAKER_11]: Jackpot!

32:24.449 --> 32:24.869
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

32:26.650 --> 32:30.853
[SPEAKER_11]: I do remember Christopher, my roommate, making a comment as we were walking by, though.

32:30.873 --> 32:32.974
[SPEAKER_11]: He said something about, like, very loudly.

32:33.014 --> 32:40.518
[SPEAKER_06]: He said something like, dirty whores, and one of the old guys, like, clicked his tongue at him as if he was, like, tisking at him.

32:41.419 --> 32:41.779
[SPEAKER_06]: It's funny.

32:44.804 --> 32:46.405
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what most people do when they listen to this show.

32:47.726 --> 32:47.966
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

32:48.427 --> 32:48.667
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

32:49.007 --> 32:50.248
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, how was your week?

32:50.268 --> 32:50.648
[SPEAKER_09]: How was your day?

32:52.109 --> 32:52.930
[SPEAKER_07]: My week was okay.

32:52.950 --> 32:54.131
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't do too much.

32:55.712 --> 32:56.973
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's see.

32:57.213 --> 32:58.554
[SPEAKER_07]: I went out and got a new game.

32:58.934 --> 33:01.436
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I have like $90 in credit to GameStop.

33:01.476 --> 33:04.458
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was like... Some of the games stopped because we were bored.

33:04.939 --> 33:06.340
[SPEAKER_07]: So we went around the mall.

33:06.660 --> 33:08.621
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, I want Tetris World!

33:08.761 --> 33:10.122
[SPEAKER_07]: So I gave her Tetris World.

33:10.583 --> 33:11.403
[SPEAKER_07]: And I bought myself...

33:12.799 --> 33:13.720
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why that's funny.

33:13.760 --> 33:14.201
[SPEAKER_07]: Girls are funny.

33:29.321 --> 33:50.637
[SPEAKER_07]: and then and then and then what was it we were wandering around looking for other stuff and I'm like hey look there's like one of those shower massagers and I'm like do you want me to get you one of those too and I forget what she said it wasn't like um she's like oh that's that's right um she's all what what would I use that for I'm like masturbation I said that really loud

33:53.132 --> 33:54.433
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that was quite funny.

33:54.753 --> 33:58.535
[SPEAKER_07]: But then also, let's see, what else did I do this week?

34:01.897 --> 34:03.338
[SPEAKER_07]: Watched a lot of X-Play.

34:04.058 --> 34:05.799
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot, a lot of X-Play.

34:06.079 --> 34:08.961
[SPEAKER_07]: And now I love the little kitties that are on there, the censor kitties.

34:09.622 --> 34:20.973
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, oh yeah, I also mentioned that I tried, um, pirating Seven Sins, and, um, it didn't work because of the CD, uh, copy protection and stuff, but I'm gonna get the work eventually.

34:21.093 --> 34:25.057
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now I'm, uh, working on Grand Theft Auto San Andreas for the PC, because that'll be fun.

34:25.818 --> 34:30.283
[SPEAKER_07]: I do have a legal copy, though, for my PlayStation 2, I just wanna play it on the PC now, too.

34:31.530 --> 34:33.151
[SPEAKER_07]: So I say that's completely illegal.

34:34.111 --> 34:43.255
[SPEAKER_07]: And other than that, I've been... I tried playing some Final Fantasy, and the servers got DNS'd attacked again.

34:43.535 --> 34:43.975
[SPEAKER_07]: Again?

34:43.995 --> 34:45.076
[SPEAKER_07]: They haven't fixed that crap yet?

34:45.156 --> 34:45.596
[SPEAKER_07]: Again.

34:46.056 --> 34:48.117
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank God I quit.

34:48.477 --> 34:50.838
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's cool, though, because it was right about when I was going to go to bed.

34:51.399 --> 34:52.919
[SPEAKER_07]: I was trying to figure a way to get out of the party.

34:52.959 --> 34:53.800
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, oh, that'll work.

34:56.141 --> 34:57.641
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, that was it.

34:58.642 --> 34:58.922
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

34:59.617 --> 35:01.298
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

35:22.003 --> 35:25.184
[SPEAKER_11]: I started drinking at about 6 o'clock last night, and what was I having?

35:25.505 --> 35:32.208
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I had that Malibu and Pineapple, but it was about the equivalent of about 10 shots of Malibu, and then a little bit of Pineapple in there.

35:32.628 --> 35:37.230
[SPEAKER_11]: So I started drinking that, and I think I had downed that whole thing by 7 o'clock.

35:37.630 --> 35:38.830
[SPEAKER_11]: So by that point, I was pretty butted.

35:38.850 --> 35:40.391
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I had a couple other miscellaneous shots.

35:40.411 --> 35:41.512
[SPEAKER_11]: I was pretty much drunk by 7.30.

35:43.012 --> 35:49.295
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, finally, I think I sobered up, and I was ready to go to the club about 9 o'clock.

35:49.775 --> 35:50.836
[SPEAKER_11]: No, stop laughing!

35:52.850 --> 35:56.431
[SPEAKER_11]: By the time I actually got to the bar, I was pretty sober.

35:57.371 --> 36:01.992
[SPEAKER_11]: Not like 100% sober, like I wouldn't try to drive a car or anything, but I was coherent, right?

36:02.352 --> 36:03.892
[SPEAKER_11]: So I get to the club, and what do I do?

36:04.032 --> 36:06.413
[SPEAKER_11]: I start drinking again, because I want to get drunk again.

36:06.773 --> 36:11.794
[SPEAKER_11]: But then everybody kept leaving, and I was dancing, and I didn't really end up getting drunk, just kind of buzzed.

36:12.234 --> 36:17.295
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is too bad, because that would have been quite an accomplishment to get drunk, sober, and then drunk again all in one night.

36:17.755 --> 36:20.396
[SPEAKER_11]: So I will just have to aspire to do that in a future week.

36:22.176 --> 36:22.656
[SPEAKER_24]: I've done it.

36:23.252 --> 36:25.593
[SPEAKER_11]: I bet you have.

36:25.673 --> 36:26.114
[SPEAKER_11]: I've done it.

36:26.154 --> 36:27.694
[SPEAKER_11]: Didn't you do that here on a show once?

36:28.395 --> 36:29.035
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, I did.

36:30.276 --> 36:30.796
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, I did.

36:30.896 --> 36:32.917
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to do another drunk show sometime.

36:32.957 --> 36:34.758
[SPEAKER_11]: We kind of missed the last couple three-day weekends.

36:34.778 --> 36:36.138
[SPEAKER_24]: Getting me drunk's expensive.

36:38.099 --> 36:39.420
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's find some cheap tequila.

36:39.520 --> 36:42.782
[SPEAKER_11]: What day does the 4th of July fall on?

36:43.002 --> 36:45.023
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm probably doing, well, I don't know.

36:45.043 --> 36:46.764
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually have had a hangover.

36:46.864 --> 36:49.425
[SPEAKER_11]: Didn't you swear after the last drunk show that you weren't doing it again?

36:50.785 --> 36:52.026
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

36:52.286 --> 36:52.846
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey.

36:53.387 --> 36:53.607
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey.

36:53.687 --> 36:54.267
[SPEAKER_11]: Guess what?

36:54.328 --> 36:54.528
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

36:54.968 --> 36:57.169
[SPEAKER_11]: The 4th of July falls on a Monday.

36:57.650 --> 36:58.010
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, right.

36:58.050 --> 36:59.171
[SPEAKER_11]: I work for a bank.

36:59.711 --> 37:00.652
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

37:00.732 --> 37:02.053
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds like we have a date set.

37:02.573 --> 37:03.674
[SPEAKER_11]: We're having a drunk show.

37:03.894 --> 37:05.275
[SPEAKER_11]: You, me, and a bottle of tequila.

37:05.315 --> 37:05.936
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll have a date.

37:06.776 --> 37:07.417
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, I got it.

37:07.497 --> 37:07.657
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

37:08.297 --> 37:10.739
[SPEAKER_22]: I will do a drunk show on one condition.

37:11.820 --> 37:14.982
[SPEAKER_22]: The tequila is the good agave tequila.

37:15.002 --> 37:15.082
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

37:15.273 --> 37:17.194
[SPEAKER_07]: How much is that going to set us back a bottle?

37:17.794 --> 37:21.095
[SPEAKER_07]: Get the crappy shit and then get a Brita water filter.

37:23.055 --> 37:25.716
[SPEAKER_07]: You filter it through a few times, golden.

37:27.196 --> 37:34.298
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of our younger listeners are kind of lost in this conversation right now, and I say that's good because... You're too young to be drinking, children.

37:34.658 --> 37:37.219
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, you should not be drinking until you're of age.

37:37.259 --> 37:39.159
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly, you've got to get the order of ages right.

37:39.239 --> 37:41.660
[SPEAKER_07]: First it's illegitimate children, then it's drinking.

37:44.580 --> 37:45.781
[SPEAKER_22]: I could take Vicodin right now.

38:04.864 --> 38:06.105
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't take Vicodin and then drink.

38:06.145 --> 38:07.105
[SPEAKER_11]: That's really, really bad.

38:07.765 --> 38:08.866
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think I can do it right now.

38:09.186 --> 38:14.648
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have to do an all-nighter if it's going to be a drinking show because I can't drive home afterwards.

38:14.688 --> 38:15.849
[SPEAKER_11]: We should do an all-nighter show.

38:16.889 --> 38:17.589
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, God.

38:20.331 --> 38:22.591
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my God, that would be great.

38:22.972 --> 38:24.672
[SPEAKER_07]: Just, like, run out of things to talk about.

38:24.812 --> 38:25.513
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get Miklatov.

38:25.533 --> 38:27.213
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so drunk.

38:27.454 --> 38:31.515
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get Miklatov here and get him drunk, too, and then we'll probably be able to get around that NDA.

38:33.717 --> 38:36.760
[SPEAKER_11]: So, Black Mikulatov, what do you have for us now?

38:40.884 --> 38:43.046
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe we could get him to bring some of his co-workers up here.

38:43.066 --> 38:43.806
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll get them all drunk.

38:43.886 --> 38:45.027
[SPEAKER_11]: One of them is liable to spill the beans.

38:46.128 --> 38:47.189
[SPEAKER_07]: Get Jason Enos up here.

38:48.551 --> 38:49.071
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

38:51.874 --> 38:52.594
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what we need to do.

38:52.674 --> 38:53.635
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell Jason Enos to come up.

38:53.655 --> 38:54.196
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll get him drunk.

38:54.997 --> 38:55.958
[SPEAKER_11]: He should come on the show.

38:56.098 --> 38:58.460
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll promise him liquor if you come hang out with us.

39:03.026 --> 39:03.667
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah, fun times.

39:03.807 --> 39:04.107
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

39:04.608 --> 39:06.789
[SPEAKER_11]: Enough talk about things that will be happening in the future.

39:06.849 --> 39:15.816
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's talk about things that are happening in the now, such as an upcoming break and an Ultramix 3 song coming your way in about 45 minutes.

39:15.836 --> 39:16.396
[SPEAKER_31]: Eventually.

39:16.997 --> 39:17.197
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

39:17.777 --> 39:21.060
[SPEAKER_11]: And here's like a little bit of a hint as to tonight's song.

39:22.870 --> 39:35.357
[SPEAKER_11]: When we discovered what the song was, I could do nothing but laugh because it really fits in with a theme we've been having going on on this show for the past couple weeks.

39:35.837 --> 39:38.719
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, it's so funny.

39:38.839 --> 39:42.081
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't even, yeah, this is going to be so funny.

39:42.201 --> 39:42.721
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't wait.

39:43.641 --> 39:44.142
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't wait.

39:44.362 --> 39:46.443
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like the biggest coincidence ever.

39:47.443 --> 39:47.884
[SPEAKER_11]: It's amazing.

39:48.627 --> 39:50.589
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a little, little, little mermaid

40:14.312 --> 40:16.974
[SPEAKER_15]: Nobody wants to know, and our beautiful world

40:31.499 --> 40:32.559
Thank you for watching!

41:03.569 --> 41:05.394
Thank you for watching!

41:33.628 --> 41:34.129
Clever!

41:34.169 --> 41:34.349
Clever!

42:13.995 --> 42:14.996
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks for watching!

42:28.374 --> 42:43.020
[SPEAKER_20]: You gotta easy pay, you gotta easy pay Akirategao no yokudakita haguruma no yori Yakesuku hizashi ga korechikuru atari Daremo kane to mirai, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no Utagau koto wo isu

42:53.264 --> 42:54.445
Thank you for watching!

44:01.707 --> 44:03.088
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for watching!

44:44.637 --> 44:45.578
Thank you for watching!

46:07.017 --> 46:08.898
Thank you for watching!

46:43.501 --> 46:44.623
I've Been Waiting For You

47:10.479 --> 47:13.720
[SPEAKER_03]: Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.

47:14.301 --> 47:16.061
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio.

47:17.982 --> 47:20.263
[SPEAKER_11]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

47:21.084 --> 47:23.985
[SPEAKER_11]: Episode number 146.

47:24.085 --> 47:25.586
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to have a contest to name your car?

47:25.606 --> 47:27.246
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to have a contest to name my car.

47:27.266 --> 47:28.647
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought you were going to name your car God.

47:29.767 --> 47:35.390
[SPEAKER_22]: No, because then I'd start calling it, you know, like, every self a deity or Jesus or...

47:36.914 --> 47:39.935
[SPEAKER_11]: And when I say, oh my god, I'm usually not referring to your car.

47:40.135 --> 47:41.435
[SPEAKER_22]: But I have a friend who goes, oh my car.

47:43.715 --> 47:44.976
[SPEAKER_22]: Seriously, she goes, oh my car.

47:45.876 --> 47:46.176
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

47:46.816 --> 47:47.456
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty awesome.

47:49.877 --> 47:53.798
[SPEAKER_11]: The bitch tickler is being suggested in the chat room.

47:54.018 --> 47:54.658
[SPEAKER_24]: That's okay.

47:54.758 --> 47:57.798
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, that sounds like a hardcore band.

47:58.819 --> 48:00.279
[SPEAKER_11]: Like an industrial band.

48:01.073 --> 48:03.355
[SPEAKER_11]: Live, it's Bitch Tickler!

48:04.115 --> 48:17.105
[SPEAKER_22]: If someone can suggest a name for my car that fits in with my interests and my pretty, pretty car with those stupid key skirts on it, then you will get something nice from me after I move.

48:17.465 --> 48:18.546
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe like a piece of the car?

48:18.947 --> 48:19.227
[SPEAKER_22]: No!

48:19.247 --> 48:20.908
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck no!

48:22.329 --> 48:22.930
[SPEAKER_22]: My!

48:23.010 --> 48:23.930
[SPEAKER_22]: How about a dust ball?

48:24.371 --> 48:25.852
[SPEAKER_22]: It's called my car.

48:27.053 --> 48:28.614
[SPEAKER_22]: And nobody gets a part of it but me.

48:31.709 --> 48:34.270
[SPEAKER_22]: My car.

48:38.492 --> 48:39.252
[SPEAKER_21]: My car!

48:40.453 --> 48:41.053
[SPEAKER_21]: Mine!

48:41.073 --> 48:42.394
[SPEAKER_21]: I waited a month!

48:42.734 --> 48:43.154
[SPEAKER_21]: Mine!

48:44.455 --> 48:49.818
[SPEAKER_11]: We're still going to be doing the Ultra Mix 3 song in about 30 minutes.

48:50.158 --> 48:52.219
[SPEAKER_11]: But for now, let's talk about another dancing game series.

48:52.439 --> 48:53.319
[SPEAKER_11]: Into Groove.

48:53.479 --> 48:56.121
[SPEAKER_11]: Into Groove was released, I guess, this week.

48:57.578 --> 48:59.300
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't get the whole in the groove thing.

48:59.320 --> 48:59.981
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what's funny?

49:00.041 --> 49:18.238
[SPEAKER_11]: And we went into both those game stores today and in both of them I completely neglected to check to see if the groove was in stock because I just... We went into GameStop three times and went into EB twice and none of those times did I bother to check for in the groove because that just wasn't the thing that was on my mind today.

49:18.298 --> 49:18.739
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel bad.

49:20.527 --> 49:26.488
[SPEAKER_11]: No, but the honest, you know, I would probably pick up In The Groove because, you know, I'm a dance game whore.

49:27.408 --> 49:30.949
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't have a PS2 American, and I have yet to mod my Japanese one.

49:31.449 --> 49:34.670
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't know if I want to mod my Japanese one because I'm afraid of fucking it up.

49:34.870 --> 49:35.470
[SPEAKER_22]: You'll fuck it up.

49:35.530 --> 49:35.790
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't do it.

49:35.810 --> 49:36.190
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

49:36.270 --> 49:38.951
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think I'll just wait for the slim PS2.

49:39.371 --> 49:42.171
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, actually, I don't want a slim PS2 because I want one that can put a hard drive in it.

49:43.272 --> 49:44.512
[SPEAKER_11]: So I have to wait for those PS2s to come.

49:44.552 --> 49:46.992
[SPEAKER_07]: I already have In The Groove with all the suns unlocked.

49:47.692 --> 49:48.253
[SPEAKER_11]: You already got it?

49:48.593 --> 49:49.713
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's called Step Mania.

49:50.646 --> 49:51.407
[SPEAKER_07]: I had it for years.

49:51.427 --> 49:53.228
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell?

49:54.489 --> 49:55.389
[SPEAKER_07]: He made it funny.

49:55.789 --> 49:57.691
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to buy it for the PlayStation 2.

49:57.851 --> 49:59.352
[SPEAKER_07]: I already have it on PC for free.

49:59.692 --> 50:01.213
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, this is the weird thing I don't get.

50:01.273 --> 50:07.197
[SPEAKER_11]: In the Groove was supposed to be released, what, June 17th, and then all of a sudden, surprise!

50:07.397 --> 50:15.262
[SPEAKER_07]: It's by June 17th because they realized... I don't think Red Octane has quite the shipping capability as, say, EA.

50:15.422 --> 50:16.303
[SPEAKER_07]: So they were just like...

50:16.883 --> 50:18.124
[SPEAKER_07]: They ship as much as we can.

50:19.605 --> 50:29.995
[SPEAKER_11]: That's understandable, but it's kind of interesting because that's not kind of what you're used to seeing for video game releases because usually it's like, okay, video games are going to ship this day to shelve the next day.

50:30.015 --> 50:31.936
[SPEAKER_11]: The traditional game release always works like that.

50:32.177 --> 50:35.219
[SPEAKER_11]: If Zelda's going to come out, you know it's going to ship and then shelve all that.

50:35.259 --> 50:42.005
[SPEAKER_11]: But then Red Octane's just kind of like, well, in the groove, it'll show up around June 17th.

50:42.145 --> 50:43.727
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe you'll see it a little sooner, but

50:44.267 --> 50:45.288
[SPEAKER_11]: June 17th will be late.

51:11.826 --> 51:22.058
[SPEAKER_11]: So, because of the fact that I don't have a PS2 American, although I need to get one, because I want In the Groove, and I want Xtreme 2 for... And we love Katamari!

51:22.078 --> 51:27.945
[SPEAKER_11]: And we are Katamari, you know, and I gotta pick up the dance games that I was pretty much leeching from Loki when I lived there.

51:28.785 --> 51:29.905
[SPEAKER_11]: So I got to pick all those up again.

51:30.226 --> 51:31.846
[SPEAKER_11]: Although, I thought I owned one of those.

51:32.146 --> 51:32.566
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe not.

51:32.926 --> 51:33.667
[SPEAKER_11]: Max 2, I think?

51:33.707 --> 51:35.027
[SPEAKER_11]: I did own Max 2 at one point.

51:35.107 --> 51:35.887
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even know where it is.

51:35.967 --> 51:36.507
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't that sad?

51:37.248 --> 51:41.229
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, so I got to get a PS2 at some point.

51:41.249 --> 51:51.972
[SPEAKER_11]: But in the meanwhile, those of you guys out there, you've already been picking up copies of In the Groove, and you've been posting to message boards about what songs are being unlocked and when.

51:53.753 --> 52:21.828
[SPEAKER_11]: And I believe, I'm trying to find out what the hidden In The Groove 2 songs were here Somebody had posted a complete list Somewhere in here, I'm looking through some threads over on ITGFreak.com Where they talk about In The Groove a lot Liquid Moon is one of the songs from In The Groove 2 That is in the game And I want to say Tribal Style is another one

52:22.964 --> 52:28.968
[SPEAKER_11]: Funk Factory, and Incognito?

52:29.449 --> 52:29.869
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that it?

52:30.009 --> 52:31.710
[SPEAKER_11]: Or is that in the group one?

52:31.830 --> 52:32.711
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even know.

52:37.294 --> 52:44.479
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure somebody in the chat room will be sure to correct me, but I know folks over there were really excited about getting to play some songs from

52:46.684 --> 52:47.665
[SPEAKER_11]: in the groove too.

52:47.945 --> 52:48.926
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's kind of neat.

52:48.986 --> 52:52.749
[SPEAKER_11]: I do like how they did that is that they brought back some songs.

52:54.430 --> 53:00.015
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, brought songs that are going to be in the next mix, like preview tracks like these do, the old DDRs.

53:00.175 --> 53:02.456
[SPEAKER_07]: So how many songs have I got unlocked before the game is good?

53:06.179 --> 53:07.020
[SPEAKER_10]: You're ruthless.

53:09.482 --> 53:10.863
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm never going to buy that game.

53:11.644 --> 53:14.686
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe if I get it for free or something, but I'll never...

53:15.276 --> 53:17.917
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll never, you know, pay my hard-earned money for that crap.

53:18.618 --> 53:21.099
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead, I'll buy, like, Dog's Life 2 or something.

53:23.501 --> 53:24.301
[SPEAKER_11]: You're really bad.

53:27.963 --> 53:29.544
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to go to one of my other resources.

53:29.604 --> 53:30.164
[SPEAKER_11]: I know how this is on.

53:30.184 --> 53:30.524
[SPEAKER_11]: There we go.

53:30.544 --> 53:42.011
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it's Funk Factory by Money Deluxe, Incognito by Inspector K, Tribal Style by Ka, and Kid Whatever with Wake Up, which apparently is getting really good reviews already, so...

53:46.641 --> 53:47.602
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm being corrected.

53:47.882 --> 53:49.643
[SPEAKER_11]: Liquid Moon is not a song from In The Groove 2.

53:49.983 --> 53:53.586
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just one of those ones that you could only play before in the non-stop mode.

53:53.826 --> 53:54.467
[SPEAKER_11]: How would I know that?

53:54.487 --> 53:55.087
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't play enough.

53:55.507 --> 53:55.808
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

53:56.228 --> 53:57.008
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry to disappoint.

53:59.450 --> 54:01.372
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently you can unlock modifiers as well.

54:02.372 --> 54:03.533
[SPEAKER_11]: Bumpy, I think, was one of them.

54:04.294 --> 54:05.935
[SPEAKER_22]: Does it have a modifier to make it a good game?

54:09.713 --> 54:13.055
[SPEAKER_07]: I hear it has link mode with DDR, but they're not similar.

54:13.435 --> 54:13.735
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't worry.

54:13.755 --> 54:13.995
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

54:14.956 --> 54:16.897
[SPEAKER_22]: Or does it have pump-it-up mode?

54:19.518 --> 54:23.060
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it does have hand plants, so I guess, yeah, sort of similar.

54:23.360 --> 54:28.182
[SPEAKER_22]: Does it have we are under the bed sheets with Endemiro mode?

54:29.703 --> 54:29.803
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

54:32.659 --> 54:52.806
[SPEAKER_11]: Some folks in chat room were talking about before the show that In The Groove 2 is out and about, apparently is starting to make its way out towards arcades, which kind of lines up with some chat that's been going on on the various web forums saying that In The Groove 2 is supposed to be shipping in this time frame early June, so In The Groove 2 could be coming to an arcade near you.

54:53.946 --> 54:58.372
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't heard if it's new cabinets and the whole works or what.

54:58.472 --> 55:03.438
[SPEAKER_11]: I imagine the box door thing had to go away, but there's no clear answer to the box door.

55:03.478 --> 55:06.942
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me be the first to do a resounding, Yippee!

55:07.423 --> 55:09.185
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god, I can't wait!

55:09.946 --> 55:10.987
[SPEAKER_13]: The groove too!

55:11.007 --> 55:11.828
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll be so much fun!

55:11.848 --> 55:12.429
[SPEAKER_11]: No, sorry.

55:12.669 --> 55:12.949
[SPEAKER_11]: Sucks.

55:13.670 --> 55:16.432
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, look, I know you don't give a shit, and I know you don't give a shit.

55:17.012 --> 55:17.672
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll try it!

55:18.193 --> 55:23.136
[SPEAKER_11]: But there are people out there in the community that do care, so I'm just trying to report on their behalf.

55:23.396 --> 55:34.062
[SPEAKER_11]: Because from what I'm hearing, one of the folks in the chat room was talking to me about In the Groove 2 before the show, and was saying that it's very polished, like it's much more polished, and now we get characters...

55:34.782 --> 55:42.225
[SPEAKER_22]: You can buy boots at the thrift store and polish them up, but they're still boots from the thrift store.

55:42.265 --> 55:48.287
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, there's hot new characters named Paige and Shemmy in the game.

55:48.447 --> 55:50.087
[SPEAKER_11]: We need Mr. Spanky!

55:50.108 --> 55:51.548
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kidding, I completely made that up.

55:51.868 --> 55:52.888
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't send the hate mail, please.

55:56.630 --> 55:56.930
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

55:57.685 --> 56:09.998
[SPEAKER_11]: So, In The Groove 2 is out, and apparently it's really polished, and all the songs from In The Groove 1, and then some, including some DDR crossovers like Bambi, and just some crazy stuff.

56:11.019 --> 56:16.886
[SPEAKER_11]: And Novice Mode's in it now, so, should be interesting, and maybe might change some of your guys' mind on In The Groove.

56:16.946 --> 56:18.748
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, you gonna give In The Groove 2 a try?

56:20.390 --> 56:21.110
[SPEAKER_11]: You gotta be fair.

56:21.170 --> 56:23.471
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on, you gotta be fair and balanced.

56:23.811 --> 56:26.332
[SPEAKER_22]: Will you at least take a piss on it if it caught on fire?

56:26.352 --> 56:26.672
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop it.

56:26.912 --> 56:27.672
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop encouraging him.

56:30.393 --> 56:33.834
[SPEAKER_07]: Fine, I'll look at it, but it's gonna be the same damn game.

56:33.854 --> 56:35.574
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, ooh, it's like red now.

56:35.714 --> 56:37.114
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's a pretty new cabinet.

56:37.154 --> 56:41.676
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's a new cabinet, and the fact that it's in a new cabinet means it's not DDR anymore, right?

56:41.776 --> 56:46.677
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I'm reading on the interweb, is that it's in a new cabinet, so it's not the same game anymore.

56:47.137 --> 56:49.698
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, that's exactly what it means, because you know what?

56:49.778 --> 57:00.422
[SPEAKER_07]: Cabinets have this thing called JAMA, meaning I can put a Pac-Man game in a normal stand-up cabinet, or I can put a Pac-Man game in a driving cabinet, or I can put a Pac-Man game in a goddamn Guitar Freaks cabinet.

57:00.822 --> 57:02.223
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still the same fucking game.

57:02.983 --> 57:04.484
[SPEAKER_07]: Doesn't matter what kind of cabinet you put it in.

57:04.984 --> 57:05.744
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what?

57:06.224 --> 57:09.886
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like I just said in the chatroom, you know, the first in the group was basically shit.

57:10.748 --> 57:12.209
[SPEAKER_22]: But shit makes the flowers grow.

57:12.669 --> 57:15.070
[SPEAKER_22]: So maybe if we bury this shit, it'll grow something good.

57:15.130 --> 57:18.371
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, the chatroom is not pleased with this track of conversation.

57:18.791 --> 57:19.572
[SPEAKER_11]: Guess what?

57:19.592 --> 57:20.452
[SPEAKER_11]: Too fucking bad.

57:20.472 --> 57:23.193
[SPEAKER_11]: There's about five people here saying stop hating.

57:23.213 --> 57:25.474
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are the only people that bought the game.

57:27.575 --> 57:28.555
[SPEAKER_22]: Boo-hoo.

57:29.235 --> 57:30.276
[SPEAKER_22]: I said I'll give it a try.

57:31.340 --> 57:34.321
[SPEAKER_22]: The first one had good music, but it was just DDR, only crappy.

57:34.581 --> 57:36.902
[SPEAKER_07]: I tried the first one, and it sucked ass, the end.

57:37.702 --> 57:40.042
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, it was DDR, only crappy.

57:42.843 --> 57:44.404
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't wait to see the review on Xplay.

57:44.624 --> 57:46.164
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to see the next one.

57:46.204 --> 57:48.745
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently it's been getting decent reviews.

57:48.825 --> 57:59.168
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know on what planet in the groove looks better than DDR, because it gave me eye strain after one song, and I never got eye strain on DDR.

58:00.329 --> 58:07.457
[SPEAKER_11]: For the record, I'm still of the school of thought here where in the groove is just another dance game to me.

58:07.557 --> 58:09.239
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't hate it, but I don't love it.

58:09.380 --> 58:13.965
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, it's not as good as the fanboys say it is, but it's not as bad as the haters say it is.

58:13.985 --> 58:17.589
[SPEAKER_11]: That includes you guys, sorry, but I don't think it's as bad as you guys make it out to be.

58:20.111 --> 58:21.491
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate the effort.

58:21.511 --> 58:24.753
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't say it was bad, I just said it was kind of not good.

58:24.893 --> 58:37.598
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate the effort they're trying to put into reviving the dance game community, but I just think they made some mistakes along the way, but that's okay.

58:37.658 --> 58:39.299
[SPEAKER_11]: I would have made mistakes too, so...

58:40.407 --> 58:42.768
[SPEAKER_11]: We've made mistakes doing a radio program.

58:42.828 --> 58:44.029
[SPEAKER_11]: It happens.

58:44.589 --> 58:51.692
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, if you are a fan of In the Groove, which apparently there are quite a few of you out there listening, because we're getting hate mail already, pick it up.

58:51.752 --> 58:52.572
[SPEAKER_11]: It's out in stores.

58:53.673 --> 58:55.594
[SPEAKER_11]: At least by June 17th, it'll be there.

58:55.994 --> 58:57.074
[SPEAKER_11]: But you might have it already.

58:57.094 --> 58:59.415
[SPEAKER_11]: We just don't know because they're shipping it randomly.

58:59.715 --> 59:02.456
[SPEAKER_07]: In the Groove is only surviving the arcades because there's no new DDR.

59:03.197 --> 59:04.037
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the only thing.

59:04.397 --> 59:05.778
[SPEAKER_07]: Once new DDR comes out, bye-bye.

59:06.638 --> 59:09.701
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, it's like, I could take my hair and dye it purple.

59:10.281 --> 59:12.243
[SPEAKER_22]: Doesn't change the fact it's going to grow back brown.

59:13.684 --> 59:21.910
[SPEAKER_22]: So, you can't, you know, take DDR, add modifiers to it, it's still going to, you know, always play like DDR.

59:24.032 --> 59:24.893
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever, I'm done.

59:25.293 --> 59:25.774
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care anymore.

59:25.794 --> 59:26.514
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, good.

59:28.576 --> 59:30.558
[SPEAKER_11]: I still am going to harass people at Best Buy, though.

59:31.539 --> 59:34.260
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, they're doing this live tour thing, right?

59:34.520 --> 59:35.081
[SPEAKER_11]: What's going on?

59:35.661 --> 59:36.921
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, live tour, woo!

59:39.062 --> 59:47.166
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what's interesting, and if you want to find out more information about this live in the groove tour or whatever they're doing, there is actually a website on Myspace.

59:47.226 --> 59:50.027
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is interesting because this goes beyond just dancing games.

59:50.067 --> 59:53.509
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we usually talk about mostly dancing games in the three hour show here, but...

59:53.993 --> 01:00:00.076
[SPEAKER_11]: This whole Myspace trend for promoting your games has gone beyond just the dance games recently.

01:00:00.737 --> 01:00:05.439
[SPEAKER_11]: Donkey Konga 2 has its own Myspace now, which I think is very, I don't know, interesting?

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:07.861
[SPEAKER_11]: If that's the word to describe it.

01:00:09.041 --> 01:00:11.823
[SPEAKER_11]: We actually posted the links to both of these on our website earlier this week.

01:00:11.963 --> 01:00:16.786
[SPEAKER_11]: Not just the Donkey Konga 2 one, but also a link to the Red Octane page on Myspace.

01:00:17.486 --> 01:00:20.948
[SPEAKER_11]: And Red Octane has their own little section of Myspace.com.

01:00:22.149 --> 01:00:22.269
[SPEAKER_11]: And...

01:00:24.782 --> 01:00:51.668
[SPEAKER_11]: And in the MySpace, they actually have posted all their live shows that they're going to do Because they're actually going to tour in the groove around And I think this probably has to do with the fact that you remember on DDR Freak a few weeks ago They were putting out a call to, they were going to hire, I don't know, Fly Girls or something They were going to be promoting this game, helping to promote the game Well, they're going out on tour, and the tour kicks off June 24th at the Best Buy in Dublin

01:00:52.708 --> 01:01:06.131
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it goes on to Santa Rosa on the 25th, Roseville, which is the one near us, on the 26th, which is my birthday, by the way, which means I'm especially not going to be there, and it has nothing to do with like or dislike for In the Groove, but I'm actually going on a company trip, so I can't...

01:01:06.536 --> 01:01:07.076
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't be there.

01:01:07.196 --> 01:01:09.838
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, he's trying to get as far away from In the Groove as possible.

01:01:09.858 --> 01:01:10.378
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, right.

01:01:10.618 --> 01:01:21.964
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's going to roll through most of California, making stops at Anime Expo on July 4th and San Diego Comic Con on July 17th, stopping along some various Best Buy stores on the way.

01:01:22.324 --> 01:01:24.945
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it's going to roll through some other conventions.

01:01:25.726 --> 01:01:32.329
[SPEAKER_11]: No other Best Buy stores yet, so if you're not into Best Buy in California, sorry you're out of luck, but they're going to various conventions throughout August.

01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:36.652
[SPEAKER_11]: Just when I thought Anime Expo couldn't get any worse, I'm proven wrong.

01:01:57.659 --> 01:01:59.340
[SPEAKER_11]: So they will be taking that out.

01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:04.602
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you want to try In The Groove, maybe you haven't played yet, don't take our word for it or not.

01:02:04.682 --> 01:02:05.782
[SPEAKER_11]: Play the game yourself.

01:02:05.842 --> 01:02:06.603
[SPEAKER_11]: Make your own decisions.

01:02:06.643 --> 01:02:08.003
[SPEAKER_11]: You can go catch them out on the road.

01:02:08.384 --> 01:02:17.387
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you want to check out the tour schedule to complete one for yourself, www.myspace.com slash redoctane, all one word.

01:02:18.028 --> 01:02:18.908
[SPEAKER_11]: So there you have it.

01:02:20.905 --> 01:02:23.786
[SPEAKER_11]: So it should be interesting, to say the least.

01:02:25.906 --> 01:02:34.028
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go ahead and we're going to go to a quick break and then we're going to come back and we're going to talk a little bit about Ultramix 3, specifically a brand new song in Ultramix 3.

01:02:34.628 --> 01:02:39.749
[SPEAKER_11]: Also the cage match when we come back a little later and some more stuff.

01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:41.489
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got more news for you guys when we come back.

01:02:41.529 --> 01:02:44.250
[SPEAKER_11]: In this break we'll do some music from 2DX.

01:02:44.810 --> 01:02:48.251
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll start it off with a little bit of Setsugeka from Tent Style.

01:02:48.511 --> 01:02:49.271
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll be back after this.

01:02:52.219 --> 01:02:52.971
Thanks for watching!

01:03:40.012 --> 01:03:40.834
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for watching!

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:38.563
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks for watching!

01:07:28.576 --> 01:07:28.877
and many more.

01:08:16.242 --> 01:08:16.547
Thank you.

01:09:00.459 --> 01:09:01.080

01:10:32.584 --> 01:10:38.411
[SPEAKER_03]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

01:10:43.328 --> 01:10:47.730
[SPEAKER_11]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, some music there in that break from the 2DX series.

01:10:49.370 --> 01:11:05.157
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, starting it off was Ryu with Setsugeka from 2DX10Style, 2DX5Style Consumer Track, C-R-A-C-K-R by Gwashi, and 2DX7Style, Zero One by Mr. T, and finally 2DX Red, John Robinson, K-K-K.

01:11:07.329 --> 01:11:08.730
[SPEAKER_11]: What was the last one you heard there in that break?

01:11:10.352 --> 01:11:11.493
[SPEAKER_11]: Skype line is open.

01:11:11.533 --> 01:11:12.815
[SPEAKER_11]: We decided we'd open it up a little bit.

01:11:12.855 --> 01:11:17.780
[SPEAKER_11]: We are going to be doing the brand new song from DDR Ultramix 3 very shortly here.

01:11:18.521 --> 01:11:27.951
[SPEAKER_11]: But I figured after that last little bit on we were talking about the In The Groove Home version, I figured there might be somebody who might want to provide a counterpoint.

01:11:28.451 --> 01:11:31.474
[SPEAKER_11]: via our Skype line, I don't know, so I am opening that up there.

01:11:31.954 --> 01:11:39.941
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to join us on the Skype line, www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on the little link that says Interact With Us, and that's how you can call in on the Skype line.

01:11:39.961 --> 01:11:40.421
[SPEAKER_11]: But you know what?

01:11:41.162 --> 01:11:46.106
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure how interactive people want to be tonight, because I'm not seeing a lot of our listeners logged into Skype right now.

01:11:46.126 --> 01:11:46.907
[SPEAKER_11]: I say we have...

01:11:51.021 --> 01:11:53.965
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, Paris Hilton chat is so outdated.

01:11:54.425 --> 01:11:57.229
[SPEAKER_07]: This is sad, and I've got to admit it, okay?

01:11:57.970 --> 01:12:06.020
[SPEAKER_07]: Nelly was bored, so she was watching, get this, it was that, oh god, chaotic...

01:12:07.523 --> 01:12:11.087
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw way too many episodes of Chaotic, and what did it teach me?

01:12:11.107 --> 01:12:13.230
[SPEAKER_07]: It taught me that Britney Spears is a whore.

01:12:13.810 --> 01:12:20.117
[SPEAKER_07]: And I already knew that Britney Spears is a whore, but, like, she's just fucking, like, Oh, Kevin Verron!

01:12:20.438 --> 01:12:21.018
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Kevin!

01:12:21.138 --> 01:12:21.579
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Kevin!

01:12:21.859 --> 01:12:23.841
[SPEAKER_13]: I had sex three times today!

01:12:24.262 --> 01:12:25.163
[SPEAKER_13]: Three times!

01:12:25.183 --> 01:12:26.845
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a fucking whore!

01:12:26.885 --> 01:12:27.686
[SPEAKER_13]: Da-da-da-da-da!

01:12:28.106 --> 01:12:30.807
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's, you know, basically what Chaotic is about.

01:12:30.827 --> 01:12:38.731
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was reading just now that Chaotic's actually going to be debuting a brand new Britney Spears video at the end of the show.

01:12:38.831 --> 01:12:39.492
[SPEAKER_08]: That's wonderful.

01:12:39.872 --> 01:12:42.713
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, I figured I'd talk about that stuff.

01:12:42.913 --> 01:12:44.914
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was watching the MTV Movie Awards.

01:12:44.974 --> 01:12:47.135
[SPEAKER_11]: Goddamn, I don't know why MTV was on all weekend.

01:12:47.276 --> 01:12:48.536
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, that skyline is open.

01:12:48.576 --> 01:12:50.217
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't have to talk about it in a group if you don't want to.

01:12:50.357 --> 01:12:52.018
[SPEAKER_07]: But they had, what was it, they were...

01:12:52.458 --> 01:12:55.079
[SPEAKER_07]: They had Jimmy Fallon hosting, which he's not funny at all.

01:12:55.459 --> 01:12:57.480
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they had Nicole Richie.

01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:59.701
[SPEAKER_07]: She was actually interviewing people on the runway.

01:13:00.241 --> 01:13:04.963
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was really bad because she's just like, Oh my God, you're so hot!

01:13:05.123 --> 01:13:05.883
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God!

01:13:05.943 --> 01:13:07.384
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was just completely stupid.

01:13:08.044 --> 01:13:09.625
[SPEAKER_07]: I really hated that show.

01:13:09.645 --> 01:13:17.208
[SPEAKER_11]: But for some reason, I watched it because I... Why don't you just... If your girlfriend feels like she has to watch this shit, leave the room.

01:13:18.569 --> 01:13:19.749
[SPEAKER_11]: We're getting a call on Skype.

01:13:20.269 --> 01:13:20.809
[SPEAKER_11]: Praise the Lord.

01:13:20.869 --> 01:13:22.090
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:13:23.010 --> 01:13:27.214
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think I was elected by the chat channel to call in and make him shut up.

01:13:28.095 --> 01:13:29.376
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we will do so.

01:13:29.497 --> 01:13:30.978
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, shut up.

01:13:31.038 --> 01:13:31.779
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell him to shut up.

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:33.240
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, shut up, man.

01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:33.641
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

01:13:36.123 --> 01:13:37.124
[SPEAKER_11]: So, what's on your mind?

01:13:38.265 --> 01:13:39.206
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, drinking.

01:13:40.007 --> 01:13:41.048
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, not much.

01:13:41.669 --> 01:13:41.769
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh,

01:13:42.452 --> 01:13:47.016
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically laughing at people as they bicker back and forth of which dance game is better.

01:13:47.436 --> 01:13:49.118
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of the neutral party in this.

01:13:49.498 --> 01:13:55.323
[SPEAKER_11]: Now you kind of came into listening to Orange Lounge Radio Live, I'm assuming from our podcast that we do, right?

01:13:55.383 --> 01:13:56.624
[SPEAKER_11]: Where we talk about other video games?

01:13:56.664 --> 01:13:58.005
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, yeah.

01:13:58.366 --> 01:14:01.208
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody gave me one of the podcasts and I was like, hey, this sounds pretty good.

01:14:01.228 --> 01:14:04.351
[SPEAKER_05]: So I tuned in last week and just liked it.

01:14:04.531 --> 01:14:07.013
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, welcome to all our folks who've been listening to the podcast.

01:14:07.994 --> 01:14:18.483
[SPEAKER_11]: We do do this three-hour show on Sunday nights, and since it kind of started about Bomani and music video games and music-based things, we still talk about them a whole awful lot here on this show, so it's something you'll get used to.

01:14:18.503 --> 01:14:20.825
[SPEAKER_11]: There are a lot of really good music games out there, though.

01:14:21.306 --> 01:14:24.949
[SPEAKER_11]: But we have been kind of trying to branch out, as you kind of saw last week.

01:14:24.989 --> 01:14:25.850
[SPEAKER_11]: We talk about, you know, just

01:14:26.210 --> 01:14:26.610
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever.

01:14:26.690 --> 01:14:28.872
[SPEAKER_11]: Pop culture stuff, other video games we like.

01:14:28.892 --> 01:14:33.374
[SPEAKER_04]: Bringing up anything Nickelodeon is insanely cool with me.

01:14:33.995 --> 01:14:38.477
[SPEAKER_11]: That was kind of just a weird show last week when we just were getting into Nickelodeon.

01:14:38.497 --> 01:14:39.358
[SPEAKER_11]: But hey, cool with me.

01:14:39.438 --> 01:14:41.619
[SPEAKER_11]: Chatroom seemed to dig it.

01:14:41.659 --> 01:14:42.880
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm all cool with that.

01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:46.241
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much anything old school in my book is really good.

01:14:46.401 --> 01:15:02.049
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's this whole, like, six degrees of separation thing going on because if you think about it this way, you have Nickelodeon, you have that show Roundhouse, and then the guy on Roundhouse was the MC at Konami's booth at E3 this year showing off the new music games.

01:15:02.409 --> 01:15:03.189
[SPEAKER_05]: So, see, it relates.

01:15:03.209 --> 01:15:07.171
[SPEAKER_05]: Some kind of six degrees of separation with video games or something.

01:15:07.191 --> 01:15:08.532
[SPEAKER_05]: There's bound to be a way to do it.

01:15:08.672 --> 01:15:09.172
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

01:15:09.532 --> 01:15:12.594
[SPEAKER_11]: We could connect anything back to, oh, we're really talking about the money.

01:15:12.634 --> 01:15:12.974
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't worry.

01:15:13.194 --> 01:15:15.176
[SPEAKER_22]: But can we connect it to Kevin Bacon?

01:15:16.177 --> 01:15:20.422
[SPEAKER_11]: Possibly Did Kevin Bacon ever make a guest spot at E3?

01:15:20.722 --> 01:15:27.989
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, okay, maybe Gary Coleman was at E3 I don't know, was Gary Coleman and Kevin Bacon ever in a movie together?

01:15:28.049 --> 01:15:30.132
[SPEAKER_05]: Gary Coleman was beating up people at the mall

01:15:33.376 --> 01:15:34.356
[SPEAKER_11]: Did Kevin Bacon do that?

01:15:34.416 --> 01:15:34.796
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:15:35.476 --> 01:15:37.077
[SPEAKER_22]: Kevin Bacon has gone to a mall!

01:15:37.377 --> 01:15:37.597
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

01:15:37.857 --> 01:15:46.599
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, as our, uh, a person who's calling in who isn't too familiar with the dance and music games, what kind of news stories have been interesting you this week in the general gaming world?

01:15:47.279 --> 01:15:52.960
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, general gaming world, uh, I'd probably have to, well, GTA, uh, San Andreas is out on PC.

01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:54.301
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yes.

01:15:54.381 --> 01:15:55.981
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to admit to it, I'm a freak.

01:15:56.001 --> 01:15:57.821
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost beat it and I just got it today.

01:15:58.201 --> 01:16:00.662
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, had you played it on PlayStation 2 or any of that previously?

01:16:01.752 --> 01:16:07.859
[SPEAKER_05]: I played it on PlayStation 2 and hated it, because it just didn't feel right to me, so I got it for PC instead.

01:16:07.979 --> 01:16:16.949
[SPEAKER_11]: I've heard a lot of bitching about the controls in that game, and I've played a little bit of San Andreas, but most of my San Andreas experience was watching Loki play, because he's better at killing people than I am.

01:16:16.969 --> 01:16:18.932
[SPEAKER_05]: The plane missions are a bitch.

01:16:19.318 --> 01:16:24.760
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, he also likes to load down the game with cheat codes, and then he'll just skydive with no parachute.

01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:26.981
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, what kind of stuff were you doing on those flying missions?

01:16:27.281 --> 01:16:30.842
[SPEAKER_11]: You used to, like, fly straight into the ground and all this crazy stuff.

01:16:30.922 --> 01:16:32.002
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't doing that.

01:16:32.262 --> 01:16:32.842
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember.

01:16:32.862 --> 01:16:35.703
[SPEAKER_05]: You can actually chop up people with a propeller if you're good enough.

01:16:35.723 --> 01:16:36.384
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's awesome.

01:16:38.584 --> 01:16:41.565
[SPEAKER_11]: But one thing I do remember from... I would car surf, and that was fun.

01:16:42.206 --> 01:16:46.427
[SPEAKER_11]: One thing I do remember from San Andreas was that the controls were a little...

01:16:47.476 --> 01:16:49.377
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a lot for like a little controller.

01:16:49.417 --> 01:16:54.840
[SPEAKER_11]: There's so much you can do in that game that the controls get a little convoluted because there's so much you can do with that controller.

01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:59.803
[SPEAKER_11]: And I imagine if you can lay that out across a keyboard, it probably makes it a little more... No, same.

01:16:59.943 --> 01:17:00.683
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you think?

01:17:01.063 --> 01:17:02.584
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yes and no.

01:17:03.304 --> 01:17:09.268
[SPEAKER_05]: For the plane missions, having a joystick is very handy, except they made it so incredibly touchy on the plane stuff.

01:17:09.588 --> 01:17:13.050
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you'll just tap it and you'll automatically go craning towards the ground.

01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:15.111
[SPEAKER_24]: It's like playing Top Gun on the NES.

01:17:15.431 --> 01:17:15.531
[SPEAKER_24]: It's

01:17:16.197 --> 01:17:17.140
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly!

01:17:17.862 --> 01:17:18.946
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all about the trainers.

01:17:21.314 --> 01:17:30.116
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's what I'm interested in because I remember watching you play Grand Theft Auto Vice City on the computer and there was that code where you could hit a button and you'd make a car rain down.

01:17:30.416 --> 01:17:35.256
[SPEAKER_07]: No, basically what it was, it was I set one button, special moves.

01:17:35.336 --> 01:17:38.617
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually there's a code where you can do make all the cars explode.

01:17:38.897 --> 01:17:42.298
[SPEAKER_07]: So I mapped that to one key, held it down, and all the cars rocket into the air.

01:17:42.358 --> 01:17:45.538
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you let go and start running and dodge the falling debris.

01:17:45.578 --> 01:17:46.078
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.

01:17:46.098 --> 01:17:46.938
[SPEAKER_05]: See, that's the kind of cool stuff.

01:17:46.958 --> 01:17:50.279
[SPEAKER_05]: You can drop like tanks and then you just keep doing a line of tanks.

01:17:50.379 --> 01:17:52.120
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, tanks, that big tank pile.

01:17:52.641 --> 01:17:58.185
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the kind of cool stuff that you can do in a game on the PC that's a little harder on PlayStation.

01:17:58.225 --> 01:18:04.330
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, they have a lot of these same codes on PlayStation, but you can do more config and hacking and all that stuff on the PC.

01:18:04.410 --> 01:18:06.451
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that's the real reason to be happy about it.

01:18:06.471 --> 01:18:07.152
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's quite funny?

01:18:07.272 --> 01:18:12.696
[SPEAKER_07]: Up to maybe last month or so, they were still releasing new codes for Grand Theft Auto, like in-game codes.

01:18:12.756 --> 01:18:15.437
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's a good way to keep your game going, you know, keep it alive a little bit.

01:18:15.577 --> 01:18:16.958
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I gotta go back and play.

01:18:17.118 --> 01:18:20.779
[SPEAKER_05]: The chatroom's talking about the sex minigame.

01:18:20.819 --> 01:18:25.701
[SPEAKER_05]: You always have where you can edit it and change it and add stuff to it.

01:18:25.961 --> 01:18:34.384
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I was seeing, I saw today on, what was it, on X-Play, they were talking about Grand Theft Auto Vice City, the two-player missions, you can make out with guys in that.

01:18:34.984 --> 01:18:35.724
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, hooray.

01:18:37.005 --> 01:18:40.125
[SPEAKER_22]: They're talking about having a mini sex game in the PC version.

01:18:40.145 --> 01:18:43.526
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura said the word sex, so I was interested here for a minute.

01:18:43.586 --> 01:18:45.787
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't found out how to do it.

01:18:45.847 --> 01:18:47.887
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been trying to find out how to do it.

01:18:48.207 --> 01:18:50.088
[SPEAKER_11]: What is up with the mini sex games lately?

01:18:50.128 --> 01:18:52.368
[SPEAKER_11]: We had one in Fable, we had one in God of War.

01:18:53.008 --> 01:18:54.829
[SPEAKER_11]: It was written into the code, but disabled.

01:18:54.949 --> 01:18:55.729
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just funny.

01:18:56.730 --> 01:18:59.592
[SPEAKER_07]: It's written in the code, but disabled for the PS2 version.

01:18:59.932 --> 01:19:07.518
[SPEAKER_07]: So if they just transferred that over to the PC, I'm sure someone will be able to find the way to, you know, get rid of that so you can actually have sex.

01:19:07.678 --> 01:19:08.319
[SPEAKER_07]: Who cares?

01:19:08.499 --> 01:19:08.999
[SPEAKER_07]: It's stupid.

01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:12.382
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, have you ever watched, you know, the hooker have sex with you in the car?

01:19:12.763 --> 01:19:14.924
[SPEAKER_07]: All it is is the car rocking and she's sitting there.

01:19:15.245 --> 01:19:15.725
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just great.

01:19:16.583 --> 01:19:20.104
[SPEAKER_05]: You can always do the really old sex joke in playing River City Ransom.

01:19:20.224 --> 01:19:23.545
[SPEAKER_05]: You walk behind the girls in the mall and make it look like you're humping them from behind.

01:19:23.686 --> 01:19:25.946
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, can you post those pictures in our chatroom, DarkSakura?

01:19:25.966 --> 01:19:26.787
[SPEAKER_11]: They might get a kick out of that.

01:19:26.807 --> 01:19:27.947
[SPEAKER_11]: I think those are fake.

01:19:27.967 --> 01:19:28.567
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they fake?

01:19:29.147 --> 01:19:29.508
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

01:19:30.208 --> 01:19:30.868
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, they are fake.

01:19:31.128 --> 01:19:32.609
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, man, you had me going for a minute.

01:19:32.849 --> 01:19:33.409
[SPEAKER_11]: They are funny.

01:19:33.949 --> 01:19:34.429
[SPEAKER_11]: Post them anyway.

01:19:34.769 --> 01:19:35.049
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:40.431
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Reznor, we've got to let you go because we're going to get to a song premiere that the Dance Game folks really want to hear.

01:19:40.451 --> 01:19:40.691
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem.

01:19:40.711 --> 01:19:41.692
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll definitely move aside for this.

01:19:41.932 --> 01:19:42.212
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:19:42.252 --> 01:19:43.452
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you have a good one, all right?

01:19:43.872 --> 01:19:44.173
[SPEAKER_05]: You too.

01:19:44.193 --> 01:19:44.393
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:19:44.413 --> 01:19:44.853
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for calling.

01:19:44.933 --> 01:19:45.113
[SPEAKER_11]: Later.

01:19:46.505 --> 01:19:48.725
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, this is interesting.

01:19:48.805 --> 01:19:55.327
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we've got folks that are tuning in that aren't used to the dance game stuff, so we've got to talk about the other stuff too, but that's alright.

01:19:55.627 --> 01:19:56.327
[SPEAKER_11]: I like all games.

01:19:56.527 --> 01:19:58.187
[SPEAKER_11]: We're game fans first, dance games second.

01:19:58.347 --> 01:20:00.387
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's talk about those dance games.

01:20:00.427 --> 01:20:05.368
[SPEAKER_11]: We promised you about now we'd be talking about the brand new DDR Ultramix 3 song.

01:20:05.428 --> 01:20:12.810
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I told you guys earlier that Miklatov, even though he's here, you might have forgot he was here because he's actually been playing the Blue DS over there.

01:20:12.850 --> 01:20:13.770
[SPEAKER_11]: He can't stop playing.

01:20:14.330 --> 01:20:15.310
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi Miklatov, how you doing?

01:20:18.624 --> 01:20:20.906
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, DarkSakura says the second one.

01:20:20.966 --> 01:20:24.489
[SPEAKER_22]: I did a little bit of digging on this, and apparently it's a mod you download.

01:20:24.609 --> 01:20:26.010
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

01:20:26.271 --> 01:20:29.813
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get to the dance thing, though, because they're impatient as it is.

01:20:30.054 --> 01:20:30.314
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:20:31.235 --> 01:20:35.038
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though Mikotov here, he is not revealing this to you guys.

01:20:35.698 --> 01:20:39.582
[SPEAKER_11]: He's under NDA, so he can't talk about it.

01:20:39.882 --> 01:20:46.528
[SPEAKER_11]: But who can talk about it, and who can talk about when their songs are in the games, are the artists themselves.

01:20:47.228 --> 01:20:55.071
[SPEAKER_11]: And sure enough, if you remember last year when DDR Ultramix 2 was coming out, we had TOY, I believe, on his website.

01:20:55.131 --> 01:20:56.731
[SPEAKER_11]: He had announced he was doing songs for DDR.

01:20:57.732 --> 01:21:01.333
[SPEAKER_11]: Alien613 or whoever had announced they were doing a song for DDR.

01:21:01.813 --> 01:21:03.934
[SPEAKER_11]: And they put the background of the song on their site.

01:21:03.994 --> 01:21:05.134
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know how they got that.

01:21:07.235 --> 01:21:12.597
[SPEAKER_11]: Mikotov, do you remember any other folks that announced their songs on their website before the rest of us found out about it?

01:21:13.911 --> 01:21:18.655
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you're all dying to find out what the song is, but I want to remind you real quick.

01:21:38.724 --> 01:21:43.086
[SPEAKER_11]: This ties into an ongoing theme we've had going on for a couple weeks here on this show.

01:21:43.386 --> 01:21:44.987
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki just found it on the page here.

01:21:45.027 --> 01:21:45.748
[SPEAKER_11]: He's laughing.

01:21:47.368 --> 01:21:51.911
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, what is the theme that it's tying into here on the show?

01:21:53.030 --> 01:22:00.634
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, I can't troll me with that stuff because I'm so very sad.

01:22:02.395 --> 01:22:04.536
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you feeling tragic?

01:22:04.816 --> 01:22:09.519
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so tragic, oh my god, I am so tragic.

01:22:09.839 --> 01:22:11.420
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my tortured existence.

01:22:11.620 --> 01:22:20.465
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, if you haven't figured it out yet, the theme that this song relates to is our gothic talking that we've been doing for the past few weeks here.

01:22:20.805 --> 01:22:23.947
[SPEAKER_22]: The artist... Because girls' butts have a lot to do with being goth.

01:22:23.967 --> 01:22:26.389
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, everybody in our chat room was rooting for girls' butts.

01:22:26.489 --> 01:22:27.029
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, guys.

01:22:27.049 --> 01:22:28.450
[SPEAKER_11]: This actually ties into another joke.

01:22:29.071 --> 01:22:30.712
[SPEAKER_11]: I couldn't believe it when I found this.

01:22:30.772 --> 01:22:33.774
[SPEAKER_11]: The artist that is doing this song is called Spray.

01:22:34.094 --> 01:22:36.355
[SPEAKER_11]: And the song is called I Am Gothic.

01:22:36.455 --> 01:22:39.357
[SPEAKER_11]: And they are claiming on their website... I'm going to quote from their website.

01:22:39.758 --> 01:22:50.245
[SPEAKER_11]: Their site is over at www.spraynet.freeserve.co.uk slash news.html And I quote from the page.

01:22:52.026 --> 01:22:53.588
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a section here that says DDR.

01:22:54.149 --> 01:23:08.245
[SPEAKER_11]: Whilst Spray's dream of soundtracking something by Ultimate play the game may never materialize, we have the genuinely exciting news that DDR Ultramix 3 on the Xbox will feature I Am Gothic, the 2003 single mix.

01:23:10.387 --> 01:23:12.848
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have a song by the artist Spray called I Am Gothic.

01:23:12.868 --> 01:23:13.649
[SPEAKER_11]: We're gonna play them.

01:23:13.809 --> 01:23:15.630
[SPEAKER_11]: It's actually available on the internet.

01:23:15.650 --> 01:23:16.950
[SPEAKER_11]: We got it off iTunes.

01:23:17.270 --> 01:23:18.511
[SPEAKER_11]: You can buy the song on iTunes.

01:23:19.211 --> 01:23:22.293
[SPEAKER_11]: We're gonna play it for you guys right now, I guess.

01:23:22.513 --> 01:23:23.073
[SPEAKER_11]: You ready for this?

01:23:23.513 --> 01:23:25.294
[SPEAKER_11]: Now remember, this is not the DDR edit.

01:23:25.314 --> 01:23:28.015
[SPEAKER_11]: This song is actually kind of long.

01:23:28.336 --> 01:23:32.698
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember that this song is going to be edited down for DDR when they actually put it in the game.

01:23:33.418 --> 01:23:37.320
[SPEAKER_11]: So this song actually clocks in at 6 minutes and 30 seconds, so it's a little bit long.

01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:43.564
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think if you listen to it, you can kind of tell what parts will be in the game.

01:23:44.384 --> 01:23:46.625
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't have to be Miklatov to know that.

01:23:46.645 --> 01:23:47.726
[SPEAKER_11]: You will probably be able to guess.

01:23:47.766 --> 01:23:57.712
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, here it is, the Orange Lounge Radio premiere of a brand new song announced by the artist on their website for DDR Ultramix 3, Spray, I Am Gothic.

01:27:01.872 --> 01:27:15.005
[SPEAKER_26]: It's no clue, I'm a freak, I don't like your bands I don't put any effort in, it's just how I am I'm disturbed, I feel hurt, I'm intense, that's me Writing poetry, it's indefinite

01:27:48.796 --> 01:27:50.325
Thank you for watching!

01:28:20.141 --> 01:28:20.903
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm a loner

01:30:12.776 --> 01:30:23.965
[SPEAKER_11]: The world premiere here on Orange Lounge Radio of that brand new song from DDR Ultramix 3 as announced by the artist on their website Spray with I Am Gothic, the 2003 single mix.

01:30:26.334 --> 01:30:27.374
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so there you have it.

01:30:27.815 --> 01:30:33.917
[SPEAKER_11]: Now remember that that song, if you thought it was a little long, don't forget that they do edit those songs down when they're put into DDR.

01:30:34.777 --> 01:30:42.920
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, if you thought it was long, don't worry, they're going to cut out some of the extra parts there and just have the meat of the song in the game.

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:45.061
[SPEAKER_11]: So, Loki, what did you think?

01:30:45.381 --> 01:30:45.961
[SPEAKER_11]: I am gothic.

01:30:46.282 --> 01:30:46.882
[SPEAKER_11]: It was okay.

01:30:47.462 --> 01:30:47.702
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah?

01:30:48.042 --> 01:30:48.362
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay?

01:30:48.702 --> 01:30:49.003
[SPEAKER_28]: It was okay.

01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:51.680
[SPEAKER_28]: It's okay.

01:30:51.920 --> 01:31:03.964
[SPEAKER_11]: I was laughing my ass off when I found out about this a little earlier this week because just because of how it fits into everything we've been talking about on the show lately, I was cracking up.

01:31:04.164 --> 01:31:04.964
[SPEAKER_28]: We're psychic.

01:31:05.664 --> 01:31:09.105
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, the Artist Spray, I actually think they are very funny.

01:31:09.465 --> 01:31:12.286
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the interesting thing about the band Spray.

01:31:12.826 --> 01:31:17.808
[SPEAKER_11]: I was kind of perusing through their website where they announced this fact that they're going to be in DDR Ultramix 3.

01:31:18.488 --> 01:31:19.868
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

01:31:43.027 --> 01:31:44.328
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, so, wait, am I right here?

01:31:44.388 --> 01:31:46.430
[SPEAKER_11]: Ricky and Daz were Space Cats who were a bus stop.

01:31:46.450 --> 01:31:46.950
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, exactly.

01:31:47.070 --> 01:31:47.230
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

01:31:47.511 --> 01:31:48.191
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, here's the deal.

01:31:48.592 --> 01:31:56.318
[SPEAKER_11]: Ricky, it says Ricardo, who is one of the folks that's in this band, Spray, is one half of pop production legends Ricky and Daz.

01:31:57.591 --> 01:31:59.212
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, you weren't a big fan of the song or...

01:32:22.528 --> 01:32:29.840
[SPEAKER_11]: It's alright, it's just generic Well don't forget that it's going to get cut down a little bit as well So it'll be even more generic?

01:32:30.501 --> 01:32:33.325
[SPEAKER_11]: No, but the parts that go on and on will be cut down

01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:37.622
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't care for much of it, honestly.

01:32:37.662 --> 01:32:38.382
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, it was okay.

01:32:38.442 --> 01:32:40.463
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd listen to it in the background, but I've heard better.

01:32:40.664 --> 01:32:46.428
[SPEAKER_11]: We found out Skulk pretty early last year, too, and that turned out to be one of the best songs.

01:32:58.680 --> 01:32:59.381
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

01:33:06.952 --> 01:33:09.914
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the lyrics in the song, let me read you some of the lyrics from I Am Gothic.

01:33:10.254 --> 01:33:12.956
[SPEAKER_11]: Step inside, candlelights in my depressing gloom.

01:33:13.437 --> 01:33:16.439
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just no brooding teen, I'm considered abstruse.

01:33:17.099 --> 01:33:19.621
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so sparse being dark, can't you feel my pain?

01:33:19.661 --> 01:33:21.923
[SPEAKER_11]: People are all the same, they isolate my ways.

01:33:22.483 --> 01:33:25.706
[SPEAKER_11]: Catch the ghost train to the center of my heart, then the dark will rise again.

01:33:26.086 --> 01:33:28.668
[SPEAKER_11]: I am potent, I am profound, then the clouds will part.

01:33:28.728 --> 01:33:29.348
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the chorus.

01:33:29.849 --> 01:33:32.611
[SPEAKER_11]: I am gothic, I am pale, I am scary, I'm insane.

01:33:32.751 --> 01:33:35.813
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a loner, I am cold, I feel special when people don't phone.

01:33:36.397 --> 01:33:36.977
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay!

01:33:37.518 --> 01:33:39.259
[SPEAKER_11]: So I can't get it.

01:33:39.319 --> 01:33:49.605
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it like they're satirized, being satirized, satire of goth bands or are they poking fun at themselves or what?

01:33:49.665 --> 01:33:50.425
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

01:33:50.705 --> 01:33:59.911
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's just a satire because anything that's synth pop is now seeming to be labeled as goth and they are definitely synth pop so they might be making fun of that.

01:34:00.211 --> 01:34:00.752
[SPEAKER_11]: IKILLWITHMYCAR

01:34:20.001 --> 01:34:21.022
[SPEAKER_11]: Read a lyric.

01:34:21.322 --> 01:34:22.963
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to hear a lyric from I Kill With My Car?

01:34:23.363 --> 01:34:32.008
[SPEAKER_11]: Rubber on tarmac, grip the wheel, cold chrome heartbeat, stainless steel, come on baby, take that step, in front of me in certain death, I kill with my car.

01:34:34.550 --> 01:34:37.491
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there's another great song on there called Fashion Stigmata.

01:34:38.472 --> 01:34:39.833
[SPEAKER_11]: Fashion Stigmata is great.

01:34:40.865 --> 01:34:52.099
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause it has singing children in it Yeah, little British children that sing Let me play, I guess I'll play little clips of these songs here real quick Let me play like a little clip of I Kill With My Car here So you guys can get a feel for this

01:35:08.820 --> 01:35:18.724
[SPEAKER_11]: You see where that... I don't know, it strikes me as like... I want to see an old woman driving a car with that blaring on... They're poking fun at the goth thing, but they're goth themselves!

01:35:19.404 --> 01:35:20.885
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's like, they're just... I don't know.

01:35:21.145 --> 01:35:23.986
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Jamie said something when she was in here earlier that kind of seemed to make sense.

01:35:24.026 --> 01:35:27.067
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, they are making fun of how people make fun of goths.

01:35:27.427 --> 01:35:28.047
[SPEAKER_11]: Or something, I don't know.

01:35:29.608 --> 01:35:34.470
[SPEAKER_11]: Other song titles on the CD, I Keep Missing the Love Boat, and Leave It to the Girls, Boys.

01:35:38.354 --> 01:35:39.895
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the clip I'll try and get a clip

01:36:13.704 --> 01:36:14.585
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so there you go.

01:36:15.065 --> 01:36:16.086
[SPEAKER_07]: I just can't get into this.

01:36:16.766 --> 01:36:17.547
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't get into it?

01:36:17.747 --> 01:36:20.489
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I like the titles, but I just can't get into the songs.

01:36:20.669 --> 01:36:21.189
[SPEAKER_07]: They're awful.

01:36:21.850 --> 01:36:23.631
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we had to look... It's like an Uyvul movie.

01:36:23.671 --> 01:36:24.291
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, come on.

01:36:24.351 --> 01:36:25.472
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like... Oh, that's harsh.

01:36:25.492 --> 01:36:26.733
[SPEAKER_07]: That is harsh.

01:36:26.933 --> 01:36:29.575
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a good concept, but executed poorly.

01:36:31.478 --> 01:36:39.327
[SPEAKER_11]: What's great is that they have a song called Child of the 80s, which is very similar to the I Am Gothic song because it's like poking fun at like, you know, reminiscing of the 80s and everything.

01:36:39.847 --> 01:36:46.314
[SPEAKER_11]: And we could have sworn when we were listening to the song for the first time that it was saying suddenly everybody rapes me because I'm a child of the 80s.

01:36:46.634 --> 01:36:47.836
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's actually rates me.

01:36:47.916 --> 01:36:49.858
[SPEAKER_11]: It's where that little accent comes into play.

01:36:52.140 --> 01:36:52.461
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:36:53.669 --> 01:36:54.890
[SPEAKER_11]: So there you go, there you have it.

01:36:55.010 --> 01:36:55.771
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope you enjoyed.

01:36:56.471 --> 01:36:56.932
[SPEAKER_11]: Check them out.

01:36:57.092 --> 01:37:02.296
[SPEAKER_11]: I personally recommend the band Spray, but it really depends on what you want.

01:37:03.678 --> 01:37:07.501
[SPEAKER_11]: Miklatov, I don't know, is there anything you can tell us further about Spray?

01:37:07.581 --> 01:37:10.624
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably not, but only personal thoughts on the band.

01:37:11.264 --> 01:37:14.327
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're my new echo image, which means they're awesome.

01:37:14.467 --> 01:37:15.968
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can't say anything about them in the game, huh?

01:37:17.209 --> 01:37:17.709
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

01:37:17.729 --> 01:37:18.409
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

01:37:41.838 --> 01:37:42.639
[SPEAKER_11]: But it makes sense.

01:37:42.719 --> 01:37:46.341
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I don't know if this is like a different drum, because they're technically not on the different drum label.

01:37:46.361 --> 01:37:50.484
[SPEAKER_11]: They're on this Ninth Wave Records, I think it was Ninth Wave, I want to say was the name of the label.

01:37:50.504 --> 01:37:51.784
[SPEAKER_11]: They're on some different type of record label.

01:37:52.425 --> 01:37:59.069
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's technically not a different drum, so it makes me think it's a licensed song, and you can't tell me, you're no help as to which one it is.

01:37:59.529 --> 01:38:11.197
[SPEAKER_11]: But I kind of see, if it is a licensed song, if we're following that little six degrees of DDR here, going from Bus Stop to Space Cats to Ricky and Daz to Spray, it makes sense.

01:38:11.597 --> 01:38:14.178
[SPEAKER_11]: How we ended up from point A to point B. So, there we go.

01:38:16.358 --> 01:38:16.638
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

01:38:18.419 --> 01:38:20.699
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm curious what our chatroom folks thought of that.

01:38:21.339 --> 01:38:22.179
[SPEAKER_11]: They probably hate it.

01:38:22.879 --> 01:38:23.560
[SPEAKER_11]: They're fickle.

01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:28.241
[SPEAKER_11]: Some folks were saying... They were talking about Max in there.

01:38:28.481 --> 01:38:28.821
[SPEAKER_19]: What?

01:38:31.501 --> 01:38:33.002
[SPEAKER_11]: We did not pay attention, chatroom.

01:38:33.022 --> 01:38:35.142
[SPEAKER_11]: People don't come to the chatroom to actually listen to the show.

01:38:35.202 --> 01:38:37.183
[SPEAKER_11]: They go there to talk about other stuff.

01:38:38.823 --> 01:38:39.223
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

01:38:42.658 --> 01:38:45.619
[SPEAKER_11]: This reminds me of Bloodhound Gang's Discovery Channel song.

01:38:45.699 --> 01:38:46.379
[SPEAKER_11]: Who said that?

01:38:46.919 --> 01:38:48.319
[SPEAKER_11]: Reznor, this guy that just called us earlier.

01:38:48.339 --> 01:38:49.300
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I don't know who he is.

01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:51.840
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess I can't make fun of him if I don't know who he is.

01:38:51.860 --> 01:38:56.741
[SPEAKER_11]: But you did say earlier when we were listening to this album in the car, you said it sounded like Eiffel 65.

01:38:56.781 --> 01:38:57.861
[SPEAKER_11]: Who did a remix of that song?

01:38:58.061 --> 01:39:02.362
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the songs, the very first track on the CD, sounds a lot like Eiffel 65.

01:39:02.462 --> 01:39:08.003
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not a bad thing because if you got over Blue and you actually had their CD, it was a pretty good CD.

01:39:10.684 --> 01:39:10.924
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:39:12.213 --> 01:39:12.813
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, DarkSakura.

01:39:13.813 --> 01:39:16.614
[SPEAKER_11]: You missed our chat about the band... Good.

01:39:17.154 --> 01:39:18.434
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they have a song.

01:39:18.454 --> 01:39:19.875
[SPEAKER_11]: I was waiting for you.

01:39:20.435 --> 01:39:24.076
[SPEAKER_22]: I was busy holding back the flood and getting two of every animal.

01:39:25.176 --> 01:39:25.376
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

01:39:27.437 --> 01:39:27.777
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it.

01:39:28.157 --> 01:39:30.557
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a song called I Kill With My Car.

01:39:30.917 --> 01:39:31.398
[SPEAKER_22]: I need that.

01:39:31.758 --> 01:39:32.458
[SPEAKER_22]: See?

01:39:32.618 --> 01:39:33.778
[SPEAKER_22]: He was telling me about it.

01:39:34.358 --> 01:39:36.519
[SPEAKER_11]: I knew she would come around as soon as she found out about that.

01:39:36.539 --> 01:39:37.479
[SPEAKER_22]: Your roommate was telling me about it.

01:39:40.011 --> 01:39:42.013
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry listeners, but I have to do this for Jamie.

01:39:42.113 --> 01:39:43.475
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to play the clip again you guys.

01:39:43.935 --> 01:39:44.476
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to do this.

01:39:44.976 --> 01:39:45.777
[SPEAKER_24]: Send this to me.

01:39:46.598 --> 01:39:47.178
[SPEAKER_26]: I like this.

01:40:03.217 --> 01:40:04.558
[SPEAKER_22]: I like this a whole lot.

01:40:04.638 --> 01:40:05.238
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, I need that.

01:40:05.258 --> 01:40:08.780
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe it's just the remix, because that was a remix, the one that's going to be in DER.

01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:10.681
[SPEAKER_22]: It sounded too sandstormy.

01:40:11.121 --> 01:40:13.242
[SPEAKER_06]: The original version of the song is amazing.

01:40:13.703 --> 01:40:16.664
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very, what did you say in the car, Edward Scissorhands?

01:40:16.744 --> 01:40:19.666
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because the beginning of the song sounds like Edward Scissorhands.

01:40:19.686 --> 01:40:21.127
[SPEAKER_22]: I like music that sounds like a suicide.

01:40:23.568 --> 01:40:24.268
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the original.

01:40:24.288 --> 01:40:25.449
[SPEAKER_11]: It sounds like Edward Scissorhands to me.

01:40:28.095 --> 01:40:31.218
[SPEAKER_11]: Now Reznor is suggesting in our chatroom that you should just name your car Killer.

01:40:31.258 --> 01:40:32.379
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll name it Silver Death.

01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:33.600
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.421
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, enough about the band Spray.

01:40:35.461 --> 01:40:36.402
[SPEAKER_11]: We've whored them out enough.

01:40:36.723 --> 01:40:39.245
[SPEAKER_11]: We hope they enjoy their 15 minutes while being in DDR.

01:40:39.565 --> 01:40:40.065
[SPEAKER_11]: But you know what?

01:40:41.066 --> 01:40:44.069
[SPEAKER_11]: Really, I haven't heard an album that made me laugh and just...

01:40:45.603 --> 01:40:46.684
[SPEAKER_11]: I just really liked it.

01:40:46.824 --> 01:40:47.384
[SPEAKER_11]: I really did.

01:40:47.444 --> 01:40:49.025
[SPEAKER_11]: It's everything I like about music.

01:40:49.125 --> 01:40:50.886
[SPEAKER_11]: It was synth pop and it was funny.

01:40:51.006 --> 01:40:52.467
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, seriously, how can you go wrong?

01:40:52.807 --> 01:40:59.610
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a song about, it sounded like being a stalker and then committing suicide and killing the other guy as well so you could be together forever.

01:41:00.270 --> 01:41:01.551
[SPEAKER_06]: That was pretty awesome.

01:41:04.449 --> 01:41:05.990
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, let's go to a break.

01:41:06.050 --> 01:41:09.633
[SPEAKER_11]: And in this break, I'm in a very Akira mood this break.

01:41:09.733 --> 01:41:13.616
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think we need to do some Akira Yamaoka this break.

01:41:13.676 --> 01:41:16.158
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to do that, and then we're going to come back and get into tonight's cage match.

01:41:16.478 --> 01:41:19.020
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll take another call on Skype if anybody's willing to call in.

01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:21.422
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll take a poll and chat and see if somebody wants to call in on Skype.

01:41:21.642 --> 01:41:27.827
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll take your calls, get to the cage match, get to the FUs of the week, and all the other gaming news we can dig up after this break.

01:41:28.267 --> 01:41:28.748
[SPEAKER_11]: Akira!

01:42:04.082 --> 01:42:04.824
Thank you for watching!

01:43:29.384 --> 01:43:32.061
Thanks for watching!

01:45:01.955 --> 01:45:02.755
Thanks for watching!

01:45:31.121 --> 01:45:31.782
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks for watching!

01:46:36.787 --> 01:46:38.149
Thanks for watching!

01:47:08.194 --> 01:47:11.476
We've just got to forever, the brain grass blows and the wind is dancing

01:47:30.143 --> 01:47:31.224
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for watching!

01:47:51.124 --> 01:47:51.944
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for watching!

01:48:08.610 --> 01:48:09.791
Thank you for watching!

01:48:47.956 --> 01:48:51.660
[SPEAKER_11]: Orange Lounge Radio We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it

01:48:57.148 --> 01:49:20.187
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello everybody, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, we are here, and if you missed it, you missed it, we premiered a brand new song from DDR Ultramix 3, it was Spray, I am Gothic, and we were talking about the band Spray for a little while, and maybe at the very, very end, after the afterbirth, we'll play it one more time for those of you guys that missed it, so stick with us and we'll play it again for those of you guys that missed it.

01:49:21.860 --> 01:49:22.540
[SPEAKER_11]: Is your mic on?

01:49:23.161 --> 01:49:34.568
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also reminded people on DDR Freak that, you know, because I told them what it was, and I reminded them that they can listen to it also on our rewinds that are on Friday on DDR Freak Radio.

01:49:34.768 --> 01:49:35.709
[SPEAKER_11]: Very nice.

01:49:35.789 --> 01:49:36.249
[SPEAKER_11]: Good plug.

01:49:36.369 --> 01:49:45.975
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, the rewind for this week won't show up until next Friday because there was a boo-boo and one of our shows got skipped, or

01:49:46.536 --> 01:49:47.296
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:50:06.305 --> 01:50:07.888
[SPEAKER_11]: I swear we weren't.

01:50:07.928 --> 01:50:08.690
[SPEAKER_11]: We really weren't.

01:50:10.153 --> 01:50:17.067
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know how long... Spray doesn't have dates as to when they do updates on their site, so we don't know when they put that up there, but...

01:50:18.038 --> 01:50:19.078
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably wasn't that long ago.

01:50:19.298 --> 01:50:20.699
[SPEAKER_07]: I figured out the connection, too.

01:50:21.179 --> 01:50:22.179
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, what is the connection?

01:50:22.199 --> 01:50:32.321
[SPEAKER_07]: The connection is that the record label, which is quite small, called Ninth Day or something, Ninth Something Records.

01:50:32.681 --> 01:50:41.063
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, they're a teeny, teeny, tiny label, and they only have a few artists, which all have really horrible webpages, except for Spray.

01:50:41.643 --> 01:50:44.464
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're actually sold by...

01:50:45.985 --> 01:50:47.466
[SPEAKER_07]: None other than a different drum.

01:50:48.546 --> 01:50:50.126
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, so I think you found the connection there then.

01:50:50.566 --> 01:50:51.547
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

01:50:51.807 --> 01:50:52.107
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

01:50:52.647 --> 01:50:54.988
[SPEAKER_07]: Which means it's probably not a licensed song.

01:50:55.368 --> 01:50:59.009
[SPEAKER_11]: Since if we ask Miklatov, he'll just say NDA, which could mean yes.

01:50:59.469 --> 01:51:01.130
[SPEAKER_11]: He's grabbing for a microphone.

01:51:01.770 --> 01:51:01.970
Was I?

01:51:02.030 --> 01:51:03.090
[SPEAKER_19]: I was grabbing for a microphone.

01:51:03.130 --> 01:51:05.091
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you look like you're grabbing for a microphone.

01:51:05.691 --> 01:51:06.431
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you're a stylist.

01:51:06.451 --> 01:51:06.831
[SPEAKER_11]: Never mind.

01:51:07.031 --> 01:51:07.511
[SPEAKER_11]: Screw you.

01:51:08.292 --> 01:51:09.152
[SPEAKER_11]: Why are you even here?

01:51:11.373 --> 01:51:12.673
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, Miklatov, he wants a mic.

01:51:14.215 --> 01:51:18.838
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here because I wanted to get drunk last night, and I succeeded.

01:51:21.260 --> 01:51:22.341
[SPEAKER_06]: He drunk himself black.

01:51:25.243 --> 01:51:25.603
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:51:26.543 --> 01:51:27.524
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, you were going to say something?

01:51:29.485 --> 01:51:32.588
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that someone needs to make a mention of the times for the rewind.

01:51:34.449 --> 01:51:37.551
[SPEAKER_11]: I would love to, but I think it's 6 o'clock, I think.

01:51:38.985 --> 01:51:40.408
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know very well.

01:51:40.609 --> 01:51:41.190
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what, though?

01:51:41.270 --> 01:51:45.559
[SPEAKER_11]: I will check DDR Freak's schedule just for you guys right now and have a look-see.

01:51:46.581 --> 01:51:49.948
[SPEAKER_11]: In the meantime, DarkSakura, if you want to plug some other shows that we have on Orange Launch Radio.

01:51:50.874 --> 01:51:52.074
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I'd like to plug one.

01:51:52.094 --> 01:51:52.794
[SPEAKER_22]: Where's my gun?

01:51:52.894 --> 01:52:04.496
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I mean... I do public volume on Tuesdays with a music request show, except no one requests anything except randomly going, We want to hear this song!

01:52:04.576 --> 01:52:06.897
[SPEAKER_22]: And I don't have it, so I tell you to send it to me.

01:52:07.417 --> 01:52:09.337
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh yeah, back to the show.

01:52:09.417 --> 01:52:11.278
[SPEAKER_22]: Pre-show starts at a quarter to seven.

01:52:11.538 --> 01:52:12.738
[SPEAKER_22]: Official time is seven.

01:52:13.238 --> 01:52:14.398
[SPEAKER_22]: Show starts at 7.30.

01:52:14.798 --> 01:52:18.499
[SPEAKER_22]: I go to 10.30 supposedly, except I've been kind of going overboard

01:52:19.099 --> 01:52:19.760
[SPEAKER_22]: I play a lot of good music.

01:52:30.464 --> 01:52:31.805
[SPEAKER_22]: It isn't necessarily a video game.

01:52:55.902 --> 01:52:57.443
[SPEAKER_11]: That doesn't involve any of us.

01:52:57.803 --> 01:53:03.507
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it's being worked on, and we're waiting to see what it sounds like to see if it's airable.

01:53:05.468 --> 01:53:06.569
[SPEAKER_11]: But it should be interesting.

01:53:06.629 --> 01:53:08.230
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we should play it even if it's not airable.

01:53:08.250 --> 01:53:09.771
[SPEAKER_11]: Either way, it should be interesting.

01:53:09.931 --> 01:53:13.534
[SPEAKER_22]: And there's also another show that I brought up.

01:53:13.734 --> 01:53:14.615
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you mentioned this before.

01:53:15.775 --> 01:53:19.578
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm moving to a new house, so it won't be there for a couple of weeks.

01:53:20.739 --> 01:53:24.981
[SPEAKER_22]: But there will be a show hosted by Dan, as in my Dan.

01:53:26.182 --> 01:53:27.804
[SPEAKER_22]: and his crazy GameStop buddies.

01:53:28.665 --> 01:53:30.287
[SPEAKER_10]: That should be very interesting.

01:53:30.307 --> 01:53:31.328
[SPEAKER_10]: GameStop talk!

01:53:32.088 --> 01:53:41.438
[SPEAKER_22]: It's going to basically be a when the new stuff comes out his show goes up, he can get it that day and play it for you even early.

01:53:42.243 --> 01:53:44.925
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going to be very cool, so something to look forward to.

01:53:45.546 --> 01:53:50.889
[SPEAKER_11]: So we are branching out, because I know my new show is going to be General Gaming as well, and that's going to be very exciting, his show.

01:53:51.029 --> 01:53:58.875
[SPEAKER_11]: We've also talked about other things, but... There is definitely coming something to the station as soon as next week that's very exciting.

01:53:59.355 --> 01:54:02.818
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not a live talk show, it's something else, but it's very exciting nonetheless.

01:54:03.639 --> 01:54:04.360
[SPEAKER_11]: I think so anyway.

01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:04.900
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be fun.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:06.482
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a fun show, if nothing else.

01:54:06.762 --> 01:54:15.592
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm doing a special show later on, too, that's going to be fun and have nothing to do with our normal shows, but it just fits because it's nerdy and geeky.

01:54:15.712 --> 01:54:17.073
[SPEAKER_07]: It's old school nerdy.

01:54:17.133 --> 01:54:18.755
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, like, old, old school.

01:54:19.416 --> 01:54:22.039
[SPEAKER_07]: So it should be a lot of fun and a little retro there.

01:54:22.219 --> 01:54:27.201
[SPEAKER_11]: So actually, for those of you that like old school, you are going to love the announcement we have this week.

01:54:27.321 --> 01:54:28.362
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully this week it's done.

01:54:28.562 --> 01:54:29.843
[SPEAKER_11]: You are going to love this announcement.

01:54:29.863 --> 01:54:31.243
[SPEAKER_11]: You will poo your pants.

01:54:31.523 --> 01:54:32.404
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe not, but maybe.

01:54:32.544 --> 01:54:32.964
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good.

01:54:33.444 --> 01:54:33.804
[SPEAKER_11]: It's great.

01:54:34.645 --> 01:54:36.186
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, anyway, so enough talking.

01:54:36.326 --> 01:54:40.588
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and I was going to mention, our website's awesome.

01:54:40.608 --> 01:54:41.528
[SPEAKER_07]: You should go check it out.

01:54:41.588 --> 01:54:45.930
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, we've got a story now about Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories with pictures.

01:54:46.270 --> 01:54:47.151
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's right, pictures.

01:54:47.871 --> 01:54:51.473
[SPEAKER_07]: Rockstar is ripping them off other people's sites, but not us, because we rock.

01:54:52.193 --> 01:54:53.634
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have pictures for you.

01:54:53.794 --> 01:54:54.554
[SPEAKER_07]: Go check them out.

01:54:54.774 --> 01:54:55.315
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty.

01:54:56.415 --> 01:54:59.457
[SPEAKER_22]: We also have the final pictures from Friday at E3.

01:55:01.078 --> 01:55:01.778
[SPEAKER_22]: They're all up too.

01:55:02.599 --> 01:55:03.559
[SPEAKER_11]: Am I in any of them?

01:55:04.540 --> 01:55:05.380
[SPEAKER_22]: No, but a slime is.

01:55:06.861 --> 01:55:09.302
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I finally got up off my ass and put up all the galleries.

01:55:09.342 --> 01:55:11.883
[SPEAKER_11]: So how many pictures total from E3 did you have?

01:55:13.204 --> 01:55:15.205
[SPEAKER_22]: About, what, 700 something?

01:55:16.586 --> 01:55:18.067
[SPEAKER_22]: Let me take a look.

01:55:18.127 --> 01:55:18.947
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll add them up.

01:55:19.908 --> 01:55:20.328
[SPEAKER_22]: Wait a moment.

01:55:21.653 --> 01:55:22.219
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you very much.

01:55:24.077 --> 01:55:25.238
[SPEAKER_22]: You can talk about how awesome I am.

01:55:26.239 --> 01:55:29.682
[SPEAKER_22]: You are... I am such a whore for the camera.

01:55:29.942 --> 01:55:30.722
[SPEAKER_11]: Mostly awesome.

01:55:31.063 --> 01:55:31.503
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just kidding.

01:55:32.264 --> 01:55:38.749
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought your story earlier was really funny about, because you came in here and you said, I was Noah and I had to collect two of everything and clean up the flood.

01:55:39.209 --> 01:55:43.633
[SPEAKER_11]: You were actually being serious because my roommate spilled a gallon of water on the floor in the kitchen.

01:55:44.193 --> 01:55:46.515
[SPEAKER_11]: So she really was gone during the whole spray thing.

01:55:46.855 --> 01:55:48.977
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I was getting sprayed.

01:55:48.997 --> 01:55:51.058
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, my roommate sprayed water all over the floor.

01:55:51.719 --> 01:55:52.459
So it works.

01:55:53.540 --> 01:55:56.784
[SPEAKER_11]: These are the kind of hints you're supposed to do before the songs are announced, people.

01:56:05.064 --> 01:56:07.966
[SPEAKER_11]: and Thursday... Which, by the way, like 20 of them are the PS3.

01:56:08.726 --> 01:56:14.569
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you can check out the PlayStation 3 from like every conceivable angle because DarkSakura got it all.

01:56:14.649 --> 01:56:20.332
[SPEAKER_22]: I put five pictures of the... five of the best pictures on the story that I did, which I'll go back and link in the chat room.

01:56:21.692 --> 01:56:25.234
[SPEAKER_22]: Just an overview of... Yeah, all the PS3 stuff is on Fridays.

01:56:25.614 --> 01:56:28.896
[SPEAKER_22]: Gunstar Superheroes, Magic Online, Kingdom Hearts, that's all Thursday.

01:56:28.916 --> 01:56:29.276
[SPEAKER_22]: I have 263 images.

01:56:31.657 --> 01:56:32.579
[SPEAKER_22]: and various stuff.

01:56:32.839 --> 01:56:38.608
[SPEAKER_22]: I also got the new Dead to Rights for PSP on the Thursday one.

01:56:39.749 --> 01:56:42.513
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh crap, I just lost the page.

01:56:42.734 --> 01:56:43.895
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, there we go.

01:56:44.236 --> 01:56:46.078
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, this is brilliant radio here.

01:56:47.039 --> 01:56:49.941
[SPEAKER_07]: and then for... Rob, where are your pictures?

01:56:50.441 --> 01:56:51.062
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not up yet.

01:56:51.082 --> 01:56:53.363
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just about to say, my pictures are still not up yet.

01:56:53.423 --> 01:56:55.244
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't take quite nearly as many as Jamie.

01:56:55.284 --> 01:56:56.705
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I had maybe about 100 total.

01:56:56.725 --> 01:56:57.345
[SPEAKER_22]: 273 for Wednesday.

01:56:57.365 --> 01:56:59.646
[SPEAKER_22]: Including pictures of army parachuting.

01:57:05.990 --> 01:57:10.793
[SPEAKER_11]: But what I do have in my picture gallery that I will be putting up soon is I have pictures of booth babes.

01:57:11.253 --> 01:57:15.595
[SPEAKER_11]: Because nothing says love into those booth babes like a gay man running around E3 with a camera.

01:57:15.936 --> 01:57:17.316
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can look forward to that.

01:57:17.536 --> 01:57:19.017
[SPEAKER_22]: I have something that tops that.

01:57:19.237 --> 01:57:19.598
[SPEAKER_11]: What's that?

01:57:19.838 --> 01:57:21.859
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a sexy picture of Shane.

01:57:22.879 --> 01:57:23.280
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you?

01:57:24.140 --> 01:57:24.640
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I do.

01:57:24.980 --> 01:57:26.281
[SPEAKER_11]: A sexy picture of Shane?

01:57:26.361 --> 01:57:29.103
[SPEAKER_11]: If you ever want to know what Miklatov looked like, you can go to the gallery right now.

01:57:29.123 --> 01:57:31.844
[SPEAKER_07]: There's actually a full page of PlayStation 3.

01:57:32.264 --> 01:57:33.045
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty funny.

01:57:33.785 --> 01:57:34.626
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh wow, there really is.

01:57:35.618 --> 01:57:37.340
[SPEAKER_22]: It's kind of blurry.

01:57:37.660 --> 01:57:39.002
[SPEAKER_22]: You're doing a thumbs up.

01:57:43.807 --> 01:57:45.209
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob also has another picture.

01:57:45.289 --> 01:57:48.433
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a sexy picture of me hugging Mario.

01:57:50.515 --> 01:57:53.198
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a story from E3, actually.

01:57:53.739 --> 01:57:56.322
[SPEAKER_22]: How Dan scared the living shit out of Miyamoto.

01:57:57.591 --> 01:57:58.051
[SPEAKER_09]: How's that?

01:57:58.212 --> 01:58:12.803
[SPEAKER_22]: He got up with this thing to be autographed, and just as Miyamoto was getting up to leave, see, he puts his hand on his shoulder, and he gives him this look of utter horror, and then Dan goes, thumbs up with a big old grin, and then he started laughing.

01:58:13.383 --> 01:58:14.204
[SPEAKER_22]: So, yeah, he signed down.

01:58:14.244 --> 01:58:14.504
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

01:58:15.085 --> 01:58:15.385
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways.

01:58:16.706 --> 01:58:16.966
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

01:58:17.246 --> 01:58:17.447
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

01:58:17.947 --> 01:58:18.588
[SPEAKER_09]: New subject, yes?

01:58:19.168 --> 01:58:19.448
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

01:58:19.588 --> 01:58:20.009
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go.

01:58:20.209 --> 01:58:20.609
[SPEAKER_09]: New subject.

01:58:20.629 --> 01:58:21.830
[SPEAKER_09]: How about the cage match, boys and girls?

01:58:22.090 --> 01:58:22.591
[SPEAKER_11]: How about?

01:58:22.851 --> 01:58:23.131
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:58:23.912 --> 01:58:24.172
[SPEAKER_27]: Woo-hoo.

01:58:27.351 --> 01:58:31.395
[SPEAKER_11]: Tonight's cage match, The Way It Works, three songs put into battle.

01:58:31.435 --> 01:58:45.926
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys in the chatroom get to vote for your favorite song, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Mamadi Music and Video Game Program, which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, on this stream when we are not here.

01:58:46.026 --> 01:58:52.752
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, the song that is the current victor is a song that has been in the victory circle for two weeks now.

01:58:53.112 --> 01:58:54.412
[SPEAKER_11]: It's halfway to retirement.

01:58:54.733 --> 01:58:56.333
[SPEAKER_11]: We haven't had a retired song in quite a while.

01:58:56.373 --> 01:59:01.695
[SPEAKER_11]: So this might be, I'm sure Jamie would be thrilled being the fangirl that she is to get this song retired.

01:59:02.375 --> 01:59:04.655
[SPEAKER_11]: But it has to happen with your guys' help.

01:59:05.276 --> 01:59:09.497
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, Loki and I are going to do our best to take it out.

01:59:10.404 --> 01:59:13.485
[SPEAKER_28]: So, yeah, we'll see.

01:59:13.545 --> 01:59:13.886
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:59:14.446 --> 01:59:14.766
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:59:14.806 --> 01:59:17.948
[SPEAKER_11]: Tonight, I know what I picked, and I know that you're very last minute.

01:59:18.248 --> 01:59:21.809
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think we're going to be giving this song much competition tonight, but you never know.

01:59:22.330 --> 01:59:22.630
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:59:22.710 --> 01:59:23.210
[SPEAKER_11]: So here it is.

01:59:23.730 --> 01:59:25.671
[SPEAKER_11]: Song number one, a clip of last week's winner.

01:59:25.691 --> 01:59:27.892
[SPEAKER_11]: You only get to hear a clip because you've heard this song already.

01:59:28.332 --> 01:59:32.534
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the Gorillaz, and the song is their next single from the album Demon Days.

01:59:32.934 --> 01:59:33.795
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Dare.

02:01:32.340 --> 02:01:33.144
[SPEAKER_20]: It's there.

02:01:58.926 --> 02:02:04.571
[SPEAKER_11]: Alrighty, that was song number one, two weeks, going for a third win tonight, Gorillaz with Dare.

02:02:05.152 --> 02:02:09.896
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, we don't get to rate that song, we're going right into the next one, because it already won, so you already know it's good.

02:02:10.316 --> 02:02:21.386
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, the next song is my pick, and I'm being really adventurous with my pick tonight, because I really think that you guys are going to kind of be really weird with this one.

02:02:21.926 --> 02:02:25.709
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, I don't know what to say, like...

02:02:26.670 --> 02:02:36.741
[SPEAKER_11]: This artist is somebody I would never consider putting in the cage match, but the production values on this song are surprisingly really good.

02:02:37.301 --> 02:02:43.347
[SPEAKER_11]: And to take a person like this, and to produce a song that is...

02:02:44.315 --> 02:02:45.796
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of infectious in a way.

02:02:45.916 --> 02:02:46.956
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of impressive to me.

02:02:47.016 --> 02:02:50.237
[SPEAKER_11]: So therefore I'm giving it a cage match spin to see what you guys think of it.

02:02:50.857 --> 02:02:53.979
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was co-written by the chick from Four Non Blondes, which I think is cool.

02:02:54.259 --> 02:02:55.159
[SPEAKER_11]: So, because she's cool.

02:02:55.399 --> 02:02:56.259
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so here it is.

02:02:56.920 --> 02:02:58.820
[SPEAKER_11]: The artist, brace yourself.

02:02:58.860 --> 02:03:00.921
[SPEAKER_11]: Now don't hate this song just after I say the artist.

02:03:01.501 --> 02:03:02.922
[SPEAKER_11]: The artist is Kelly Osbourne.

02:03:03.882 --> 02:03:05.963
[SPEAKER_11]: And this song is One Word.

02:03:06.323 --> 02:03:06.623
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay?

02:03:07.023 --> 02:03:07.924
[SPEAKER_11]: So give it a chance.

02:03:08.044 --> 02:03:10.105
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't hate it just yet because it's kind of dancey.

02:03:10.485 --> 02:03:10.965
[SPEAKER_11]: Check it out.

02:03:11.025 --> 02:03:13.606
[SPEAKER_11]: Kelly Osbourne, One Word, here on the cage match.

02:03:19.642 --> 02:03:21.382
[SPEAKER_11]: See, even my computer doesn't want to play it here.

02:03:21.422 --> 02:03:22.583
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's try this again, kids.

02:03:23.243 --> 02:03:26.284
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Kelly Osbourne with One Word here in the Cage Match.

02:03:27.804 --> 02:03:28.064
One Word

02:03:51.713 --> 02:03:52.554
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

02:04:20.700 --> 02:04:47.445
[SPEAKER_20]: The silence tells me all I need to know One word, one word Tells me everything I need to know One world driven into madness Madness driven by the depths below One word, one word Tells me everything I need

02:05:06.574 --> 02:05:31.641
[SPEAKER_20]: One lie tells of thousands of years The greatest stories that were ever told One lie, one lie Tells the greatest stories ever told Once man can predict the future A future journey into outer space One fan, one fan

02:05:35.467 --> 02:05:37.529
[SPEAKER_20]: A future journey into outer space

02:06:04.679 --> 02:06:10.242
It's not the way that I want it, it's just the way that I need it Day after day, day after day

02:07:27.823 --> 02:07:32.445
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, that was song number two in tonight's cage match, Kelly Osbourne, One Word.

02:07:33.285 --> 02:07:36.226
[SPEAKER_11]: And now we get one vote from each person.

02:07:36.286 --> 02:07:38.907
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, not a vote, but one judgment.

02:07:39.007 --> 02:07:40.928
[SPEAKER_11]: One judgment from each person here in the room.

02:07:41.168 --> 02:07:44.949
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura.

02:07:45.589 --> 02:07:49.811
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I heard this in your car last week, and I liked it.

02:07:50.051 --> 02:07:50.911
[SPEAKER_22]: It's okay.

02:07:51.031 --> 02:07:52.692
[SPEAKER_22]: It is, though, really repetitive.

02:07:53.612 --> 02:07:53.752
[SPEAKER_22]: And...

02:07:55.960 --> 02:08:00.265
[SPEAKER_22]: She doesn't really sound like herself through all the synth and everything, which I guess might be a blessing in disguise.

02:08:00.926 --> 02:08:01.427
[SPEAKER_11]: I think so.

02:08:03.649 --> 02:08:05.632
[SPEAKER_22]: It would be a background song for me, honestly.

02:08:05.732 --> 02:08:06.353
[SPEAKER_22]: I give it a...

02:08:09.313 --> 02:08:10.953
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm being really nice to give a seven.

02:08:11.574 --> 02:08:14.135
[SPEAKER_11]: Me personally, I think it's great.

02:08:14.255 --> 02:08:22.939
[SPEAKER_11]: Kelly Osbourne, okay, the rock thing really didn't work for her, so she can't sing so well, so let's find a genre that fits perfectly for people who can't sing that well.

02:08:23.199 --> 02:08:25.340
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's revive 80s new wave, it works great.

02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:28.141
[SPEAKER_11]: So I like it, so I give it an eight for 80s.

02:08:29.142 --> 02:08:34.024
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, she needs to get her dad to fucking sing with her, because at least that would be cool.

02:08:35.485 --> 02:08:35.945
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly.

02:08:36.494 --> 02:08:39.884
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a music file of Ozzy Osbourne doing Stayin' Alive

02:08:40.296 --> 02:08:41.757
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, that was fucking awesome.

02:08:41.797 --> 02:08:42.097
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard that.

02:08:42.117 --> 02:08:42.657
[SPEAKER_07]: That was great.

02:08:42.737 --> 02:08:42.997
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

02:08:43.017 --> 02:08:44.838
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, hello, Cade, I gotta bring that in.

02:08:44.878 --> 02:08:47.379
[SPEAKER_07]: All aboard the disco chain!

02:08:47.459 --> 02:08:47.779
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:48.780
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm bringing that in.

02:08:48.820 --> 02:08:50.060
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, one word, one word.

02:08:50.381 --> 02:08:50.781
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, one word?

02:08:50.801 --> 02:08:51.141
[SPEAKER_07]: One song.

02:08:51.441 --> 02:08:52.161
[SPEAKER_07]: It was okay.

02:08:52.421 --> 02:08:56.443
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just kind of, it was, it was very, um, boring.

02:08:57.344 --> 02:08:59.405
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't like Kelly Osbourne at all.

02:08:59.965 --> 02:09:02.386
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, it was just kind of, eh.

02:09:02.566 --> 02:09:05.187
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just, I don't know.

02:09:05.207 --> 02:09:09.009
[SPEAKER_07]: She could keep doing that same genre because it's not as bad as, like, say, I don't know, um,

02:09:10.140 --> 02:09:15.944
[SPEAKER_07]: Lala, or something like that, you know, I know that's not Kelly Osbourne, but just as bad, and trying to be rocked.

02:09:16.104 --> 02:09:18.646
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you make me wanna la la, that one?

02:09:18.666 --> 02:09:28.833
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, this 80s, not 80s, this pop rock crap that they're doing now, not good, okay, it's crap, but it's good to see you're going in a new direction, so I guess I give it a 7.

02:09:28.953 --> 02:09:30.114
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

02:09:30.234 --> 02:09:32.856
[SPEAKER_11]: Miklatov, something you can talk about tonight, for once.

02:09:33.176 --> 02:09:34.157
[SPEAKER_06]: Kelly Osbourne, one word.

02:09:34.477 --> 02:09:37.720
[SPEAKER_06]: It was okay, um, kind of boring, I think that's the theme.

02:09:38.700 --> 02:09:38.880
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, 6.

02:09:40.524 --> 02:09:40.905
[SPEAKER_11]: All righty.

02:09:41.486 --> 02:09:42.948
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get into song number three.

02:09:42.988 --> 02:09:46.773
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Loki's song, and he refuses to tell me the name, so he will be doing the introduction.

02:09:46.813 --> 02:09:48.615
[SPEAKER_07]: So Sal will be doing the introduction.

02:09:48.776 --> 02:09:50.338
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, this song, it's...

02:09:51.084 --> 02:09:56.867
[SPEAKER_07]: I did two remixes today, one of them being a remix to Dropout, which we're not playing, and the other remix is to Skulk.

02:09:56.887 --> 02:10:00.449
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Echo Image Skulk with, um, oh god, what the hell was the name of this?

02:10:00.489 --> 02:10:00.729
[SPEAKER_07]: It was...

02:10:19.449 --> 02:10:20.690
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody Understands Mix.

02:10:20.771 --> 02:10:21.451
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it was.

02:10:21.571 --> 02:10:24.054
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so this is Skulk, the Nobody Understands Mix.

02:10:24.715 --> 02:10:25.195
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.

02:10:25.315 --> 02:10:25.676
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

02:10:27.237 --> 02:10:29.219
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to talk about what you mixed it with later?

02:10:29.740 --> 02:10:34.225
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot of different versions of Skulk put together and also some other songs and stuff.

02:10:35.565 --> 02:10:42.970
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some things I would have loved to do to it that I couldn't do, and so, you know, I see all the flaws in it, you know, going into it, but it's... Way to sell it.

02:10:43.410 --> 02:10:52.116
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I'm sorry, okay, because I don't want to just, you know, pop out mixes that are just something you're going to see on Bomani Style, you know, like some of the crap that's on there.

02:10:52.577 --> 02:10:55.999
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm really picky on the stuff that I want to release out there on the internet.

02:10:56.019 --> 02:10:58.701
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why the dropout thing is not ever getting released on the internet.

02:10:59.521 --> 02:11:00.262
[SPEAKER_07]: But we'll hear that later.

02:11:00.302 --> 02:11:05.045
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, this is Echo Image, Skulk, the No Ending Your Stands mix.

02:11:08.566 --> 02:11:32.772
[SPEAKER_20]: The fragments of my soul Make me understand what I've become The falling like I always did Make me take control About the weakness, is it that You're leaving me to find what I have lost My heart beats with a boundless pain

02:13:57.968 --> 02:13:59.129
Thank you for watching!

02:15:19.033 --> 02:15:24.803
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, Loki there, remixing Echo Image with Skulk, the Nobody Understands mix.

02:15:24.943 --> 02:15:30.592
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see if the judges, us, were able to understand it, or we just didn't get it.

02:15:31.213 --> 02:15:31.614
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.

02:15:32.981 --> 02:15:35.322
[SPEAKER_22]: It was overall good.

02:15:36.562 --> 02:15:41.944
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that the music overshadowed, it was imbalanced versus the lyrics.

02:15:42.944 --> 02:15:44.265
[SPEAKER_22]: It was actually pretty imbalanced.

02:15:45.305 --> 02:15:56.749
[SPEAKER_22]: I thought that the beat itself on the first measure could have, at the beginning of every measure, could have been a little bit more subdued because I started getting headaches.

02:15:57.049 --> 02:16:00.190
[SPEAKER_22]: Which is how I do it whenever any song does like that.

02:16:00.270 --> 02:16:01.591
[SPEAKER_22]: It doesn't matter what song it is.

02:16:02.569 --> 02:16:09.635
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, it was, though, solid with a little tweaking, it could be a 10, so I, for right now, give it a 7.5.

02:16:11.317 --> 02:16:11.637
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki.

02:16:12.338 --> 02:16:17.902
[SPEAKER_07]: Exact same thoughts, because I have the same problems trying to pull just, you know, vocals out of there.

02:16:18.343 --> 02:16:22.366
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't really do that if I don't have a vocal track, but I work with what I got, so, you know, I give it a 9.

02:16:24.029 --> 02:16:42.763
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I, you know, I would think that Loki and Echo Image colliding would be like an instant 10, but for me, like, some of it was just like too busy, like the middle part of it was like too much, like I think I felt the Jamie thing was like, oh my god, there's like too much here, um, but I think for what he had to work with, Loki did an amazing job, I think what it is, is it's

02:16:43.403 --> 02:16:53.267
[SPEAKER_11]: The beginning of a really, really good mix, and if Loki could get the original samples and stuff, he could clean it up a lot, and it would totally, like, just blow us all away.

02:16:53.327 --> 02:17:12.275
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard because when you're working with, like, three or four different tracks at once, mixing them together on top, and only one has a vocal track, pulling the vocals out of there is impossible, and I've tried the best I could to, like, subdue the other tracks while I have a vocal track going, but it's, like, extremely, extremely hard to do, and that was, like, the best I can get after a couple hours today.

02:17:12.529 --> 02:17:14.290
[SPEAKER_22]: I do have a piece of advice in general, though.

02:17:14.691 --> 02:17:17.973
[SPEAKER_22]: You know those drum beats that get louder as they go?

02:17:17.993 --> 02:17:19.654
[SPEAKER_22]: You use those quite a lot.

02:17:19.694 --> 02:17:21.315
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I recognize that, too, in this song.

02:17:21.355 --> 02:17:23.777
[SPEAKER_22]: You use that in every single mix!

02:17:24.518 --> 02:17:25.839
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just temporary stuff.

02:17:25.899 --> 02:17:26.239
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

02:17:26.599 --> 02:17:27.179
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what, though?

02:17:27.500 --> 02:17:30.722
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a start to something absolutely brilliant.

02:17:30.762 --> 02:17:32.223
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that a simple crescendo would be good.

02:17:32.463 --> 02:17:34.825
[SPEAKER_11]: These people should be contacting you to remix their stuff.

02:17:34.845 --> 02:17:34.825
7.5.

02:17:34.965 --> 02:17:35.505
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, Mikotov.

02:17:39.511 --> 02:17:48.979
[SPEAKER_06]: It reminded me a lot of the extended mix that is on Amazon.com that when people first heard about Skulk, they were downloading and thinking it was going to be in the game.

02:17:50.160 --> 02:17:54.023
[SPEAKER_06]: Not overly fond of that one, but it was still decent nonetheless.

02:17:54.484 --> 02:17:54.824
[SPEAKER_06]: Seven.

02:17:56.245 --> 02:17:58.547
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's recap, kids.

02:17:58.607 --> 02:17:59.928
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not up to us, it's up to you.

02:17:59.948 --> 02:18:04.392
[SPEAKER_11]: Here are the three songs you get to vote for tonight in tonight's cage match.

02:18:05.373 --> 02:18:07.715
[SPEAKER_11]: Song number one you can vote for tonight is Dare.

02:18:18.415 --> 02:18:27.204
[SPEAKER_11]: And song number two you can vote for tonight is Kelly Osbourne with One Word.

02:18:35.512 --> 02:18:43.219
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, and song number three you can vote for tonight is Echo Image, remixed by Loki, Skulk, the Nobody Understands mix.

02:18:55.487 --> 02:18:57.870
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, place vote now.

02:18:57.970 --> 02:19:06.079
[SPEAKER_11]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote for song number one, song number two, or song number three.

02:19:06.159 --> 02:19:07.981
[SPEAKER_11]: Or you can call them by the artist or name.

02:19:08.362 --> 02:19:09.143
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not retarded.

02:19:09.163 --> 02:19:10.604
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be able to figure it out each way.

02:19:10.765 --> 02:19:12.667
[SPEAKER_07]: We should play my other song since it's on the CD.

02:19:13.027 --> 02:19:14.408
[SPEAKER_11]: We will get to that.

02:19:15.288 --> 02:19:17.970
[SPEAKER_11]: However, I want to give you a chance to talk about what's going on in the synth scene.

02:19:17.990 --> 02:19:18.930
[SPEAKER_07]: In the synth scene?

02:19:19.650 --> 02:19:19.891
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing.

02:19:20.991 --> 02:19:24.793
[SPEAKER_07]: And sadly enough, I wish I had something to talk about, but there is nothing.

02:19:25.153 --> 02:19:28.715
[SPEAKER_07]: So instead, I'm going to talk about something else, and that's diverse systems, D9's coming out.

02:19:29.335 --> 02:19:36.979
[SPEAKER_07]: I still haven't figured out a way to actually be able to order the rest of them, since their English page only goes up to D6, which I have everything from that back.

02:19:38.300 --> 02:19:46.947
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I'm going to maybe try, because I hate experimenting with sending them money, especially since there's that language barrier there.

02:19:47.667 --> 02:19:54.152
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to try to order something that's not on their order page, that's on the Japanese order page, and see if they send it anyways.

02:19:55.893 --> 02:19:56.914
[SPEAKER_07]: And hopefully they do.

02:19:57.214 --> 02:19:59.896
[SPEAKER_07]: If that's the case, because there's a lot of CDs I've got to catch up on.

02:20:00.116 --> 02:20:06.541
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole D7, D8, and then since D9 was announced, and then there's, you know, was it Hello Mr...

02:20:09.035 --> 02:20:09.435
[SPEAKER_07]: What was it?

02:20:09.536 --> 02:20:14.118
[SPEAKER_07]: Desire and Hello Mr. Taka, I think, or something like that.

02:20:14.399 --> 02:20:16.740
[SPEAKER_07]: So, those we still need to get.

02:20:16.760 --> 02:20:24.665
[SPEAKER_07]: But they've announced the stuff for D9 already, and there's a lot of remixes from 9th and 10th style in it so far, so it should be interesting.

02:20:25.866 --> 02:20:27.707
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so that's pretty much it for the sim scene.

02:20:27.915 --> 02:20:28.516
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:20:51.542 --> 02:20:52.583
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura has something...

02:21:08.641 --> 02:21:09.502
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura's WTF News

02:21:29.822 --> 02:21:33.843
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't turn out to be as good as I thought it was going to be.

02:21:34.323 --> 02:21:36.244
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a B-side remix of Dropout.

02:21:36.464 --> 02:21:37.825
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really have a title for it.

02:21:37.985 --> 02:21:39.005
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just kind of interesting.

02:21:39.045 --> 02:21:44.627
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem with it is, for one, I couldn't do much with Dropout and the song.

02:21:45.047 --> 02:21:51.529
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I slowed the first song down to be about Dropout speed, it didn't sound right.

02:21:52.649 --> 02:21:57.351
[SPEAKER_07]: You can listen to it, it's okay, but it's never going to be on the internet to download.

02:21:57.451 --> 02:22:00.332
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is the dropout B-side mix, I guess.

02:22:00.492 --> 02:22:05.294
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess, because it's about, it's like, you know, like how we did, what was it, Acid that one time?

02:22:05.834 --> 02:22:11.736
[SPEAKER_07]: It was an okay remix, it's not anything I'd be proud of or like be out there, you know, say, hey, look at what I did.

02:22:12.036 --> 02:22:18.999
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just like kind of, okay, I did it, you know, I started it, I finished it, just to get it done, so then, you know, moving on.

02:22:19.019 --> 02:22:19.939
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this on the MySpace?

02:22:20.632 --> 02:22:20.752
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

02:22:20.972 --> 02:22:21.152
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

02:22:21.733 --> 02:22:23.494
[SPEAKER_11]: Plug your MySpace, though, for folks that are into this.

02:22:23.555 --> 02:22:35.245
[SPEAKER_07]: If they liked your Echo Image Mix and they liked this... If they like the Echo Image Mix, when it's done, finally, it will be on my MySpace page, which is myspace.com slash LokiFusion, all one word.

02:22:35.765 --> 02:22:36.506
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can check it out.

02:22:37.046 --> 02:22:38.507
[SPEAKER_07]: How many friends do you have now?

02:22:38.768 --> 02:22:40.369
[SPEAKER_07]: I have about 17 friends.

02:22:40.429 --> 02:22:40.849
[SPEAKER_13]: Woo-hoo!

02:22:41.410 --> 02:22:43.632
[SPEAKER_07]: People that I've... They're just random people.

02:22:43.832 --> 02:22:44.212
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

02:22:44.272 --> 02:22:44.973
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of neat.

02:22:45.673 --> 02:22:48.415
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, Myspace.com slash LokiFusion.

02:22:48.475 --> 02:22:49.096
[SPEAKER_07]: You can check it out.

02:22:49.116 --> 02:22:50.517
[SPEAKER_07]: I made a little cool banner for it.

02:22:50.637 --> 02:22:54.820
[SPEAKER_07]: And my page doesn't look too bad, so it's pretty nice.

02:22:54.860 --> 02:22:55.300
[SPEAKER_07]: Check it out.

02:22:55.721 --> 02:23:00.504
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now we've got the Ecstasy remix, because that's my favorite.

02:23:00.804 --> 02:23:09.410
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got the Battle Without Honor or Humanity, the 88 Severed Limbs mix, which is on there.

02:23:09.450 --> 02:23:13.633
[SPEAKER_07]: We also have, which some people are saying they couldn't find before, the Radical Faith...

02:23:15.681 --> 02:23:17.544
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Judgment Mix, I think is what I called it.

02:23:18.064 --> 02:23:18.925
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's on there as well.

02:23:19.165 --> 02:23:19.906
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so check it out.

02:23:19.946 --> 02:23:20.327
[SPEAKER_11]: Here it is.

02:23:21.068 --> 02:23:22.129
[SPEAKER_11]: Premiere of Dropout.

02:23:22.149 --> 02:23:25.213
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably the only time you'll hear this.

02:23:25.273 --> 02:23:26.814
[SPEAKER_11]: Dropout, the B-side mix by Loki.

02:23:26.975 --> 02:23:27.155
[SPEAKER_11]: Enjoy.

02:25:13.035 --> 02:25:15.717
[SPEAKER_07]: Why I'm not going to put that on the internet.

02:25:15.797 --> 02:25:16.177
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Loki?

02:25:16.497 --> 02:25:19.159
[SPEAKER_07]: I said, you can see why I'm not going to put that up on the internet.

02:25:19.219 --> 02:25:21.000
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the folks in the chatroom kind of dug that one.

02:25:22.121 --> 02:25:22.501
[SPEAKER_07]: It's okay.

02:25:22.981 --> 02:25:25.182
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nothing I'd be proud of.

02:25:25.202 --> 02:25:25.543
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

02:25:25.963 --> 02:25:26.243
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

02:25:29.585 --> 02:25:35.109
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, while I tally up the cage moach, make cage moach, cage match votes over here.

02:25:35.129 --> 02:25:35.930
[SPEAKER_11]: Love that cage moach.

02:25:36.050 --> 02:25:37.071
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, love that cage moach.

02:25:37.931 --> 02:25:46.258
[SPEAKER_11]: She is going to bring you the WTF report where, you know, it's just a story that you could only find somewhere out there on the internet.

02:25:46.298 --> 02:25:50.141
[SPEAKER_11]: So, DarkSakura, what do you have to share with us in the WTF report?

02:25:51.517 --> 02:26:03.831
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, there's an article, actually I found this on DDR Freak, but it was on Yahoo News about an international robotics show that they do in Japan.

02:26:05.212 --> 02:26:08.136
[SPEAKER_22]: It's at the Aichi World Expo in Nagagude.

02:26:10.359 --> 02:26:22.784
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, they had a humanoid robot with a skin-like substance, a working mouthful torso, it moves as though it's breathing, it sits and acts as a tour guide.

02:26:23.684 --> 02:26:31.807
[SPEAKER_22]: But apparently the robot was so realistic looking that they were pretty much afraid of it.

02:26:31.827 --> 02:26:33.908
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, what does this represent for the future?

02:26:33.928 --> 02:26:35.789
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm going to post a link to...

02:26:37.369 --> 02:26:41.012
[SPEAKER_22]: There's actually a good slideshow from the whole thing, so I'm going to post this picture.

02:26:41.492 --> 02:26:42.673
[SPEAKER_22]: And you should look through the slideshow.

02:26:42.713 --> 02:26:44.894
[SPEAKER_22]: They have ballroom dancing robots.

02:26:45.394 --> 02:26:47.535
[SPEAKER_22]: They have robots that will do your kitchen deeds for you.

02:26:47.595 --> 02:26:52.899
[SPEAKER_22]: They show pictures of the bomb squad robots, which I've actually, they have employed in Israel already.

02:26:53.519 --> 02:26:58.342
[SPEAKER_07]: The question that everybody wants to know, though, was she a pleasure model?

02:27:00.583 --> 02:27:01.184
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what?

02:27:02.825 --> 02:27:03.185
[SPEAKER_22]: Shut up.

02:27:04.020 --> 02:27:04.940
[SPEAKER_07]: I've actually seen this.

02:27:04.960 --> 02:27:07.041
[SPEAKER_07]: This was on Engadget earlier this week.

02:27:07.061 --> 02:27:07.881
[SPEAKER_07]: It was pretty cool.

02:27:08.782 --> 02:27:10.722
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole thing about the robots too.

02:27:10.762 --> 02:27:16.484
[SPEAKER_07]: They had a caption contest for the picture with the two ballroom dancing robots and that was funny.

02:27:17.464 --> 02:27:20.525
[SPEAKER_11]: What are these strange looking gloves the robot has on her hands?

02:27:20.585 --> 02:27:22.266
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it's to prevent those types of things.

02:27:22.346 --> 02:27:22.806
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

02:27:23.655 --> 02:27:25.256
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe her hands are just not finished yet.

02:27:25.496 --> 02:27:29.217
[SPEAKER_22]: But you know, the thing is that I saw this and I was thinking about the movie that I saw last night.

02:27:30.078 --> 02:27:31.078
[SPEAKER_22]: iRobot or what?

02:27:31.678 --> 02:27:31.858
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

02:27:32.338 --> 02:27:50.766
[SPEAKER_22]: I went to go see, well I don't want to spoil it because it's going to be on Syfy in a couple months, but I went to see Bruce Campbell showing his new movie, doing like a 40 theater tour in the United States of a film he did in Bulgaria.

02:27:51.326 --> 02:27:53.747
[SPEAKER_22]: Call of the Man with the Screaming Brain, based on the Dark Horse comics.

02:27:54.927 --> 02:28:04.671
[SPEAKER_22]: But the thing is that it's hard for me to say this because there is an android moment in the movie, and the robot just made me flashback since I saw it last night.

02:28:04.711 --> 02:28:08.992
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what that robot reminds me of, and it's completely not having to do with robots at all?

02:28:09.492 --> 02:28:17.075
[SPEAKER_07]: It reminds me of this really crappy Japanese show called Hey Mikey, where it's all... Hey Mikey was done like Thunderbirds was.

02:28:17.635 --> 02:28:19.316
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all with mannequins.

02:28:19.657 --> 02:28:23.499
[SPEAKER_07]: Not, you know, like the little puppets or whatever.

02:28:23.519 --> 02:28:26.481
[SPEAKER_07]: We're talking full-size mannequins and it was creepy as hell.

02:28:27.462 --> 02:28:29.103
[SPEAKER_07]: I gotta buy that DVD.

02:28:29.283 --> 02:28:30.824
[SPEAKER_11]: That was kind of like today's special.

02:28:30.864 --> 02:28:32.766
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate to bring up the Nickelodeon thing two weeks in a row.

02:28:32.786 --> 02:28:33.446
[SPEAKER_11]: I love today's special.

02:28:33.486 --> 02:28:35.327
[SPEAKER_11]: But today's special was the mannequins were coming to life.

02:28:35.347 --> 02:28:36.788
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember the 80s movie, Mannequin?

02:28:37.309 --> 02:28:40.451
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

02:28:40.511 --> 02:28:41.492
[SPEAKER_22]: Mannequin 2 was bad.

02:28:42.492 --> 02:28:43.213
[SPEAKER_11]: Mannequin 2 was bad.

02:28:43.233 --> 02:28:44.213
[SPEAKER_22]: The first one was actually kind of good.

02:28:44.233 --> 02:28:44.314
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

02:28:45.452 --> 02:28:46.172
[SPEAKER_11]: How do you know they don't already?

02:28:46.192 --> 02:28:47.033
[SPEAKER_22]: How do you know they don't already?

02:28:47.053 --> 02:28:48.373
[SPEAKER_22]: How do you know they don't already?

02:28:48.393 --> 02:28:49.753
[SPEAKER_11]: How do you know they don't already?

02:29:11.411 --> 02:29:11.871
[SPEAKER_11]: Bad joke.

02:29:12.812 --> 02:29:13.873
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the ferret lives among us.

02:29:13.893 --> 02:29:17.176
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's how I know they don't already, because there's too many retarded people out there.

02:29:18.857 --> 02:29:19.337
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly.

02:29:19.718 --> 02:29:20.699
[SPEAKER_22]: Bad programming.

02:29:20.759 --> 02:29:22.020
[SPEAKER_22]: They haven't got it right yet.

02:29:22.200 --> 02:29:23.761
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe the robots are meant to do that.

02:29:23.781 --> 02:29:27.004
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been programmed to make live to my sister.

02:29:27.804 --> 02:29:28.505
[SPEAKER_22]: No, no, no, no.

02:29:28.545 --> 02:29:33.469
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a difference between being a full-on physical robot and just being a walking automaton.

02:29:33.789 --> 02:29:38.213
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, if they cloned a sheep first, maybe they will make a robot of the pleasure sheep first.

02:29:39.366 --> 02:29:40.627
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

02:29:40.867 --> 02:29:44.888
[SPEAKER_11]: Would having sex with a pleasure sheep be just as shameful as sex with a real sheep?

02:29:45.148 --> 02:29:46.229
[SPEAKER_11]: I think more so.

02:29:47.389 --> 02:29:48.950
[SPEAKER_11]: I love animals.

02:29:49.010 --> 02:29:50.351
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's not a real sheep.

02:29:51.091 --> 02:29:52.772
[SPEAKER_11]: Mikotov, you love sheep.

02:29:53.932 --> 02:29:54.933
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you love animals?

02:29:55.993 --> 02:29:58.374
[SPEAKER_06]: Sheep are one of my three phobias.

02:29:59.094 --> 02:30:00.235
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really sad.

02:30:00.895 --> 02:30:01.595
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the other two?

02:30:01.795 --> 02:30:03.076
[SPEAKER_06]: Flying bugs in water.

02:30:04.096 --> 02:30:05.277
[SPEAKER_22]: That's four then.

02:30:06.843 --> 02:30:08.144
[SPEAKER_11]: Flying Bugs, Water, and Sheep.

02:30:08.284 --> 02:30:08.724
[SPEAKER_24]: That's three.

02:30:09.504 --> 02:30:11.025
[SPEAKER_24]: Flying Bugs, Water, and Sheep.

02:30:11.065 --> 02:30:12.026
[SPEAKER_22]: Flying Bugs.

02:30:12.226 --> 02:30:15.327
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, like those huge Brazilian cockroaches.

02:30:16.588 --> 02:30:20.770
[SPEAKER_22]: You don't want to go into Alabama, though, because my mama got chased down the hall by a flying Brazilian cockroach.

02:30:21.691 --> 02:30:22.371
[SPEAKER_22]: It was really nasty.

02:30:22.471 --> 02:30:28.234
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, what happens, though, if you find a flying sheep that's insect-like and it happens to be sitting in a pond?

02:30:28.314 --> 02:30:31.376
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's just got to be your worst nightmare right there.

02:30:33.280 --> 02:30:35.100
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheap or tasty, that's all I gotta say.

02:30:35.641 --> 02:30:38.001
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, lamburgers, mmm, yummy.

02:30:38.601 --> 02:30:40.922
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait a minute, one of your fears is water, Miklatov?

02:30:41.602 --> 02:30:42.082
[SPEAKER_11]: He's saying yes.

02:30:42.342 --> 02:30:43.602
[SPEAKER_11]: Then I have to ask, how do I microfest this?

02:30:43.622 --> 02:30:45.903
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to ask, what do you think of Ultramix 3's theme, then?

02:30:46.003 --> 02:30:47.583
[SPEAKER_11]: Ha ha ha, bubbles!

02:30:48.903 --> 02:30:49.423
[SPEAKER_06]: Stupid.

02:30:51.884 --> 02:30:54.844
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, Ultramix 4, the theme's gonna be shiny lights.

02:30:55.465 --> 02:30:58.005
[SPEAKER_07]: To pick up, you know, the mentally challenged audience.

02:30:59.705 --> 02:31:02.326
[SPEAKER_11]: Because Ultramix 2, did it really have a theme?

02:31:02.834 --> 02:31:03.154
[SPEAKER_11]: Blue.

02:31:03.735 --> 02:31:04.715
[SPEAKER_11]: Blue was the theme.

02:31:04.835 --> 02:31:05.836
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm sure that made you happy.

02:31:05.856 --> 02:31:07.877
[SPEAKER_11]: The theme is dance game.

02:31:08.078 --> 02:31:09.238
[SPEAKER_11]: This will be the ultimate theme.

02:31:09.459 --> 02:31:15.162
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be bubbles, and then glitter, and then ecstasy.

02:31:18.012 --> 02:31:20.193
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder how many of those Ultimix games will crank out, man.

02:31:20.333 --> 02:31:20.813
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be crazy.

02:31:21.433 --> 02:31:21.973
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, anyway.

02:31:22.493 --> 02:31:24.894
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's talk about tonight's cage match winner, boys and girls.

02:31:25.694 --> 02:31:31.956
[SPEAKER_11]: The winner of tonight's cage match... It was no small vote tonight, kids.

02:31:32.016 --> 02:31:35.236
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys pretty much voted this one in somewhat of a landslide tonight.

02:31:35.677 --> 02:31:38.717
[SPEAKER_11]: It was song number... Three.

02:31:39.738 --> 02:31:41.778
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki remixing Echo Image.

02:31:43.559 --> 02:31:44.879
[SPEAKER_11]: Skull, how did this win?

02:31:46.055 --> 02:31:56.241
[SPEAKER_11]: Because our chat room has a huge boner for Echo Image, and they have a huge boner for you, so when you put two and two together, they can't contain it at their erection anymore, and it just comes all over the place.

02:31:56.261 --> 02:31:59.383
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish that it would have lost so that I could put the good one in later.

02:31:59.764 --> 02:32:00.064
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, well.

02:32:00.084 --> 02:32:00.824
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's funny?

02:32:01.085 --> 02:32:08.649
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to be bringing a different song for Cage Match, but I forgot my stupid flash drive that I have.

02:32:08.990 --> 02:32:12.812
[SPEAKER_07]: And what's funny is I've tried to bring that song two times, and both times I've

02:32:13.132 --> 02:32:13.512
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura

02:32:32.058 --> 02:32:35.620
[SPEAKER_11]: Dark Knight in the chatroom is asking, has Loki's remixes ever took a loss?

02:32:35.680 --> 02:32:37.520
[SPEAKER_11]: And I do recall that you did lose at least once.

02:32:37.540 --> 02:32:38.341
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, a couple times.

02:32:39.941 --> 02:32:40.862
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what it was, though.

02:32:41.682 --> 02:32:43.743
[SPEAKER_11]: I am not a very good Orange Lounge Radio historian.

02:32:44.443 --> 02:32:47.284
[SPEAKER_11]: DDR Angel, who hasn't been here for a couple weeks, I hope she's alright.

02:32:47.724 --> 02:32:49.225
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm starting to worry now.

02:32:49.245 --> 02:32:51.186
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to call the police if she doesn't come next week.

02:32:52.306 --> 02:32:56.608
[SPEAKER_11]: But she's a very good historian of the show, so when I have questions like these, I can ask her.

02:32:56.768 --> 02:32:59.569
[SPEAKER_07]: The last one, I think, was Legend of Trance 2005, maybe?

02:33:03.917 --> 02:33:04.518
[SPEAKER_11]: F.U.s of the week

02:33:25.563 --> 02:33:26.664
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll be back after this.

02:33:26.684 --> 02:33:31.869
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to start off this break with some Akumajo Dracula medley from Keyboard Mania.

02:33:31.909 --> 02:33:33.671
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll be back after this with the FUs of the week.

02:33:33.711 --> 02:33:35.333
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to start sending those in right now, you can.

02:33:35.393 --> 02:33:36.214
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll be back after this.

02:35:23.395 --> 02:35:24.580
Thank you for watching!

02:35:55.055 --> 02:35:56.277
Thank you for watching!

02:37:35.347 --> 02:37:35.969
Thanks for watching!

02:39:48.809 --> 02:39:49.769
[SPEAKER_11]: Gaming Radio.

02:39:49.989 --> 02:39:57.252
[SPEAKER_30]: So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

02:39:57.452 --> 02:39:58.792
[SPEAKER_30]: Orange Lounge Radio.

02:39:59.672 --> 02:40:01.893
[SPEAKER_11]: He should be a foreign correspondent for us.

02:40:02.153 --> 02:40:03.534
[SPEAKER_11]: That'd be awesome.

02:40:03.874 --> 02:40:04.854
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel naked tonight.

02:40:06.269 --> 02:40:07.570
[SPEAKER_11]: I have all my clothes on, don't worry.

02:40:07.590 --> 02:40:08.910
[SPEAKER_11]: We didn't turn off the webcam because of that.

02:40:08.930 --> 02:40:10.571
[SPEAKER_11]: We turned off the webcam because the webcam was crappy.

02:40:11.011 --> 02:40:12.892
[SPEAKER_11]: Because the room is really dark.

02:40:12.912 --> 02:40:15.714
[SPEAKER_11]: The room is too dark and the webcam is not that good.

02:40:15.774 --> 02:40:17.774
[SPEAKER_11]: So when we get a better webcam, we will bring that back.

02:40:17.794 --> 02:40:18.315
[SPEAKER_11]: We promise.

02:40:18.675 --> 02:40:22.697
[SPEAKER_11]: We might even get one of those freaky remote controlled ones where you could control it during the show.

02:40:24.318 --> 02:40:25.399
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll hide over here.

02:40:40.373 --> 02:40:44.496
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so what we're going to do now is we're going to get into the... Oh, the reason why I feel naked.

02:40:44.536 --> 02:40:44.816
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello.

02:40:45.076 --> 02:40:47.798
[SPEAKER_11]: The reason why I feel naked is because I don't have headphones this week.

02:40:48.798 --> 02:40:51.560
[SPEAKER_11]: I broke them last week, and I have yet to go get new ones.

02:40:51.600 --> 02:40:52.241
[SPEAKER_11]: I keep forgetting.

02:40:52.401 --> 02:40:58.104
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I remembered at Target today that I needed new razors and all that other stuff, but I forgot to get headphones because I'm a dumbass.

02:40:58.725 --> 02:41:00.006
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel naked.

02:41:00.086 --> 02:41:03.728
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't hear myself in my ears, and therefore my ego is saddened.

02:41:03.928 --> 02:41:05.409
[SPEAKER_07]: And I forgot to mention earlier that

02:41:05.836 --> 02:41:07.657
[SPEAKER_07]: TheCoachCarter came to my work.

02:41:30.046 --> 02:41:30.547
[SPEAKER_07]: Grr, argh

02:41:53.917 --> 02:41:56.459
[SPEAKER_22]: The motherfucker who keyed my car.

02:41:57.200 --> 02:41:59.982
[SPEAKER_22]: I hope you have a plague of gnats inside your testicles.

02:42:03.786 --> 02:42:07.029
[SPEAKER_22]: Also, you know, I'm really not too angsty because I love my car.

02:42:07.745 --> 02:42:09.507
[SPEAKER_22]: My car fills me full of joy.

02:42:10.148 --> 02:42:16.836
[SPEAKER_22]: But, you know, for you people who think, oh, I'm gonna pass the Lancer, fuck you, okay?

02:42:17.036 --> 02:42:17.516
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck you.

02:42:18.297 --> 02:42:20.520
[SPEAKER_22]: My car kicks your ass.

02:42:20.980 --> 02:42:23.904
[SPEAKER_22]: Except for that special edition Corvette that passed me yesterday.

02:42:26.074 --> 02:42:39.723
[SPEAKER_22]: and FU to Krispy Kreme because yesterday I had my cheat day and I ate three donuts and they were damn good but I got sick because sugar makes my stomach hurt a lot.

02:42:41.244 --> 02:42:42.245
[SPEAKER_22]: www.darkskura.com

02:43:07.495 --> 02:43:08.235
[SPEAKER_22]: F you to moving.

02:43:08.655 --> 02:43:11.656
[SPEAKER_22]: Where I'm glad to be getting out of my crap hole apartment complex.

02:43:13.397 --> 02:43:16.498
[SPEAKER_22]: It's the whole packing all of my stuff up that sucks.

02:43:16.998 --> 02:43:18.539
[SPEAKER_22]: It makes me a little depressed too.

02:43:19.199 --> 02:43:24.141
[SPEAKER_22]: But overall, I think the biggest F you for moving is the dust.

02:43:25.261 --> 02:43:27.562
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm gonna lay down the law on the new house.

02:43:28.322 --> 02:43:30.583
[SPEAKER_22]: Their house will be regularly dusted.

02:43:31.363 --> 02:43:31.803
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's all.

02:43:33.864 --> 02:43:35.345
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on to Loki.

02:43:37.560 --> 02:43:38.361
[SPEAKER_09]: If I can here.

02:43:42.323 --> 02:43:45.025
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I hate Britney Spears.

02:43:45.845 --> 02:43:48.927
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, she just needs to fall off the face of the earth permanently.

02:43:49.888 --> 02:43:53.070
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, I don't know what it is about her, but she fucking sucks.

02:43:53.854 --> 02:44:13.806
[SPEAKER_07]: Hater, and fucking you the goddamn Final Fantasy XI, going down, you know, how am I supposed to ignore my family and friends and play an online game if you keep, you know, DNS crashing on me, so, oh well, I guess short doses for Final Fantasy, and then, um,

02:44:15.287 --> 02:44:27.036
[SPEAKER_07]: Finally, fuck you to Round Table for your smokehouse combo pizza because it was actually pretty tasty, but it has barbecue sauce on it, so that just doesn't fit.

02:44:27.056 --> 02:44:28.457
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

02:44:28.898 --> 02:44:34.442
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and fuck you to my apartment because the stove, for some reason, smokes uncontrollably, and I don't know why.

02:44:34.722 --> 02:44:35.543
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to figure that out.

02:44:36.123 --> 02:44:37.524
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's without anything in it.

02:44:40.727 --> 02:44:43.549
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty much all that I have to deal with right now.

02:44:46.624 --> 02:44:47.125
[SPEAKER_09]: and I'm done.

02:44:47.445 --> 02:44:48.126
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, then my turn.

02:44:53.453 --> 02:44:57.058
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to give an FU to this show that they have on MTV.

02:44:57.158 --> 02:45:00.463
[SPEAKER_11]: First of all, I want to give an FU to the fact that I was even watching MTV at all, but I was really bored.

02:45:00.783 --> 02:45:03.387
[SPEAKER_11]: But I want to give an FU to this show on MTV called Next.

02:45:04.090 --> 02:45:06.451
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it's the biggest piece of trash I've ever seen in my life.

02:45:07.271 --> 02:45:08.992
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so obviously scripted.

02:45:09.012 --> 02:45:12.194
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, this is why people hate reality TV is because of a show like this.

02:45:12.514 --> 02:45:17.596
[SPEAKER_11]: And what I really hate is I really hate its portrayal of gay guys because it makes them look all like whores.

02:45:17.996 --> 02:45:25.199
[SPEAKER_11]: Because when they're like ready to speed date or whatever, the guys who are waiting to speed date are all too busy on the bus making out with each other.

02:45:25.260 --> 02:45:26.980
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm like, you're all a bunch of whores.

02:45:27.300 --> 02:45:27.961
[SPEAKER_11]: But to be...

02:45:28.901 --> 02:45:33.047
[SPEAKER_11]: On TV, dating strangers that you know nothing about is kind of whorish anyway.

02:45:33.367 --> 02:45:39.295
[SPEAKER_11]: At least they're giving away money so I can kind of sympathize with them a little bit because I do crazy shit for money as well.

02:45:39.775 --> 02:45:43.179
[SPEAKER_11]: But F you to MTV for having crappy shows like Next.

02:45:43.700 --> 02:45:45.102
[SPEAKER_11]: So, that's it.

02:45:45.785 --> 02:45:47.286
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's my only FU of the week this week.

02:45:47.346 --> 02:45:49.227
[SPEAKER_11]: I've actually had a pretty decent week, I can't complain.

02:45:50.007 --> 02:45:52.809
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, Mikotov, what do you have for us tonight?

02:45:55.370 --> 02:45:56.811
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yay, Lion Suki.

02:45:58.031 --> 02:46:00.392
[SPEAKER_06]: I have an FU to NDAs, because oh my god.

02:46:01.333 --> 02:46:02.333
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, guys.

02:46:02.974 --> 02:46:03.774
[SPEAKER_06]: NDAs suck.

02:46:05.295 --> 02:46:08.797
[SPEAKER_11]: FU to... That sounded like a good oh my god, though.

02:46:08.837 --> 02:46:11.238
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, oh my god, I want to tell you something, but I can't.

02:46:12.384 --> 02:46:14.345
[SPEAKER_11]: NDA.

02:46:15.305 --> 02:46:18.306
[SPEAKER_06]: FU to the crappy EB employee today.

02:46:18.626 --> 02:46:26.129
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I have love for EB since that's where I came from, but EB guy today was just complete jerk and rude.

02:46:26.889 --> 02:46:32.351
[SPEAKER_06]: And the GameStop guy was just a little better, so FU to EB.

02:46:33.132 --> 02:46:39.654
[SPEAKER_06]: FU to Mario64, it's a crappy game but I can't stop playing it on my DS because it was free.

02:46:41.461 --> 02:46:47.267
[SPEAKER_06]: and FU to having to work tomorrow and FU to being drunk last night because that was painful.

02:46:47.307 --> 02:46:49.489
[SPEAKER_06]: That was funny.

02:46:49.569 --> 02:47:00.459
[SPEAKER_06]: It was cool when I wasn't in pain because that drinking game we played, King's Cup, was funnier than anything until I had to drink a lot during it.

02:47:01.581 --> 02:47:04.243
[SPEAKER_06]: But, yeah.

02:47:04.263 --> 02:47:04.343
[SPEAKER_20]: Who?

02:47:08.013 --> 02:47:10.675
[SPEAKER_22]: That was just a random thing.

02:47:10.916 --> 02:47:13.438
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll tell you later.

02:47:13.578 --> 02:47:17.702
[SPEAKER_22]: At E3, the guy with the really long hair who was up there playing DDR.

02:47:17.782 --> 02:47:18.843
[SPEAKER_22]: This was one of his cosplays.

02:47:18.883 --> 02:47:19.763
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll put it in the chatroom.

02:47:19.783 --> 02:47:21.565
[SPEAKER_22]: He's at Sunnyvale Gauntlet all the time.

02:47:21.765 --> 02:47:23.266
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

02:47:23.306 --> 02:47:24.447
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen him as Kai.

02:47:25.128 --> 02:47:25.849
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to him.

02:47:26.509 --> 02:47:28.050
[SPEAKER_06]: Ruining Kai from Guilty Gear.

02:47:29.211 --> 02:47:29.712
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's it.

02:47:30.553 --> 02:47:32.434
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's get to the chatroom, shall we?

02:47:32.454 --> 02:47:34.336
[SPEAKER_11]: Because our chatroom is especially angsty tonight.

02:47:34.356 --> 02:47:35.477
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

02:47:37.469 --> 02:47:42.290
[SPEAKER_11]: OMGitsDoobz, although he's under the guise of OMGtitsboobz, but whatever.

02:47:42.951 --> 02:47:46.692
[SPEAKER_11]: FU to SSJ100, Matt, and MPQ for being such whores about my new name.

02:47:46.772 --> 02:47:47.212
[SPEAKER_11]: Suck it up.

02:47:47.292 --> 02:47:48.612
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I was just a whore about your name, too.

02:47:48.632 --> 02:47:48.852
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

02:47:48.972 --> 02:47:50.473
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, I came up with that name.

02:47:50.613 --> 02:47:51.013
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

02:47:51.173 --> 02:47:52.934
[SPEAKER_11]: FU to Orlando for being so damn shitty.

02:47:52.974 --> 02:47:54.634
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just a waste of 14 hours of my life.

02:47:54.794 --> 02:47:56.255
[SPEAKER_11]: FU to Wangang... I'm sorry.

02:47:56.715 --> 02:47:59.396
[SPEAKER_11]: Wang... Wagang... I can't pronounce this word for the life of me.

02:47:59.516 --> 02:48:02.437
[SPEAKER_11]: Wagang... Wagang... Wagang... Wang... Wangan?

02:48:02.757 --> 02:48:03.977
[SPEAKER_11]: I think maybe... Wangan?

02:48:04.417 --> 02:48:05.417
[SPEAKER_11]: He missed a letter, then.

02:48:05.738 --> 02:48:06.558
[SPEAKER_11]: Wangan Midnight 2.

02:48:07.938 --> 02:48:08.719
[SPEAKER_11]: Wangan, whatever.

02:48:09.119 --> 02:48:10.300
[SPEAKER_11]: That game, the race game.

02:48:10.680 --> 02:48:18.047
[SPEAKER_11]: Because of it, I don't like Initial D Arcade anymore and F you to Malaysian people and MMOs because their English is just as annoying as the English of Brazilian people.

02:48:18.827 --> 02:48:20.349
[SPEAKER_11]: That was good and racist.

02:48:20.429 --> 02:48:23.712
[SPEAKER_11]: He also says, oh, and F you to O2 Jam for having such bad songs.

02:48:23.772 --> 02:48:24.112
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate it.

02:48:25.985 --> 02:48:29.048
[SPEAKER_11]: Moving on, Yuki would like to say, F you to work being so dead today.

02:48:29.468 --> 02:48:32.831
[SPEAKER_11]: Much as the money would help with my credit card payment, I just wanted to be sent home early.

02:48:33.152 --> 02:48:33.692
[SPEAKER_11]: I know the feeling.

02:48:34.433 --> 02:48:37.135
[SPEAKER_11]: StarTetsuya says, F you to AOL and my phone line.

02:48:37.175 --> 02:48:38.657
[SPEAKER_11]: I missed half the show because of it.

02:48:39.538 --> 02:48:40.559
[SPEAKER_11]: America Offline.

02:48:41.459 --> 02:48:45.383
[SPEAKER_11]: DJ Dark Knight says, let me just flat out say it, F you to gas prices.

02:48:45.523 --> 02:48:46.244
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and an F you to work.

02:48:47.401 --> 02:48:53.367
[SPEAKER_11]: SSJ100 Matt says, F you to real life work for keeping me away from this show and games in general.

02:48:53.587 --> 02:48:54.328
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to emo.

02:48:54.888 --> 02:48:56.470
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to the New York Yankees losing.

02:48:56.550 --> 02:48:58.051
[SPEAKER_11]: Laugh now, but they will be back.

02:48:59.693 --> 02:49:04.117
[SPEAKER_11]: MPQ says, F you to myself for forgetting about the show last week.

02:49:05.198 --> 02:49:07.120
[SPEAKER_11]: LemonLimeJump says, F you to my town.

02:49:07.400 --> 02:49:07.781
[SPEAKER_11]: Period.

02:49:09.130 --> 02:49:13.773
[SPEAKER_11]: Reznor says, nice fuck you to people that think Honda Civics with bling can outrace anything.

02:49:14.153 --> 02:49:18.496
[SPEAKER_11]: And another F you to anyone that thinks any NES game sucks because of the graphics.

02:49:21.298 --> 02:49:22.619
[SPEAKER_11]: What about Bubble Bath Babes?

02:49:22.739 --> 02:49:24.300
[SPEAKER_11]: The graphics were kind of shitty in that game.

02:49:24.921 --> 02:49:27.582
[SPEAKER_11]: And the game could have been a whole lot better if the graphics were better.

02:49:27.883 --> 02:49:30.985
[SPEAKER_28]: That game was too damn hard for boobies, okay, honestly.

02:49:32.537 --> 02:49:32.797
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

02:49:33.177 --> 02:49:36.038
[SPEAKER_11]: Illusion says major, major, major F you to In The Groove shipping.

02:49:36.098 --> 02:49:39.138
[SPEAKER_11]: Not an F you to In The Groove, but an F you to the fact that I didn't get my copy.

02:49:39.558 --> 02:49:43.319
[SPEAKER_11]: My friend doesn't order things online, so she gave me her money to order the game for her.

02:49:43.659 --> 02:49:46.180
[SPEAKER_11]: So both copies of the game were supposed to ship to my house.

02:49:46.520 --> 02:49:50.101
[SPEAKER_11]: But only her copy shipped to my house on Friday, driving me mad with anger.

02:49:50.801 --> 02:49:52.221
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to only three people going to carry it.

02:49:52.241 --> 02:49:54.581
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you get to keep your copy, and she has to wait for hers.

02:49:54.621 --> 02:49:55.842
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the way it works, buddy.

02:49:55.862 --> 02:49:57.562
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

02:49:58.607 --> 02:50:00.268
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting question in the chatroom there.

02:50:00.328 --> 02:50:04.711
[SPEAKER_11]: Vid Palace says, Did you know that AOL has a video game radio station?

02:50:05.412 --> 02:50:07.353
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you know that ours is better?

02:50:08.073 --> 02:50:09.735
[SPEAKER_22]: Did you know that we don't give a flying flip?

02:50:11.075 --> 02:50:12.857
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you ever know that you're my hero?

02:50:15.118 --> 02:50:16.459
[SPEAKER_07]: You're everything I wish I could be.

02:50:17.260 --> 02:50:18.561
[SPEAKER_22]: Can you fly higher than an eagle?

02:50:20.302 --> 02:50:21.503
[SPEAKER_07]: I am the wind beneath your... Stop it!

02:50:21.643 --> 02:50:22.923
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop it right now!

02:50:24.224 --> 02:50:24.685
[SPEAKER_11]: God...

02:50:28.141 --> 02:50:28.501
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

02:50:30.062 --> 02:50:32.463
[SPEAKER_11]: I almost want to play something from old school NES, but I'll wait.

02:50:32.583 --> 02:50:35.345
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll wait for another appropriate occasion to do that.

02:50:37.466 --> 02:50:38.066
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

02:50:39.147 --> 02:50:39.867
[SPEAKER_11]: What can we do now?

02:50:40.127 --> 02:50:41.188
[SPEAKER_11]: We could do some Ask Orange Lounge.

02:50:41.228 --> 02:50:42.889
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have any questions in yet.

02:50:45.190 --> 02:50:46.410
[SPEAKER_11]: We're starting to run out of show here.

02:50:46.430 --> 02:50:47.411
[SPEAKER_11]: We're running out of steam.

02:50:48.131 --> 02:50:49.452
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't have no post of the week.

02:50:49.572 --> 02:50:50.973
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have another news story?

02:50:50.993 --> 02:50:51.753
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have something, Loki?

02:50:51.773 --> 02:50:53.654
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess we're just going to have to talk about other news.

02:50:54.588 --> 02:50:55.313
[SPEAKER_22]: I know, it sucks.

02:50:55.957 --> 02:50:57.930
[SPEAKER_22]: I have dead skin on my feet.

02:50:59.568 --> 02:51:02.629
[SPEAKER_07]: That's breaking news, folks.

02:51:02.709 --> 02:51:06.530
[SPEAKER_07]: PSP, Homebrew on version 1.5 PSP.

02:51:06.570 --> 02:51:07.650
[SPEAKER_07]: That means all you U.S.

02:51:07.670 --> 02:51:13.712
[SPEAKER_07]: people that have been waiting for Homebrew games and all the Japanese people have been rubbing it in your face, it's coming.

02:51:14.292 --> 02:51:20.413
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be released supposedly on June 15th at 3 p.m.

02:51:21.333 --> 02:51:22.054
[SPEAKER_07]: General Mountain Time.

02:51:22.634 --> 02:51:26.835
[SPEAKER_07]: And what's cool about it is what they're saying right now is it's only running on version 1.5, so...

02:51:27.975 --> 02:51:29.776
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you mean Greenwich time?

02:51:30.657 --> 02:51:31.037
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

02:51:32.037 --> 02:51:32.458
[SPEAKER_11]: Never mind.

02:51:32.898 --> 02:51:33.798
[SPEAKER_11]: Just poking fun.

02:51:34.619 --> 02:51:35.099
[SPEAKER_07]: Kiss my ass.

02:51:35.119 --> 02:51:35.499
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care.

02:51:36.120 --> 02:51:41.783
[SPEAKER_07]: All I know is it's coming out in a couple days and that makes me happy because I'll be able to run crappy stuff for the PSP.

02:51:42.003 --> 02:51:46.106
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be able to put all my Game Boy Advance games on the PSP.

02:51:46.526 --> 02:51:48.807
[SPEAKER_07]: How's that for irony?

02:51:49.187 --> 02:51:50.988
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, yeah, it's going to be coming out.

02:51:51.008 --> 02:51:51.769
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be cool.

02:51:52.270 --> 02:51:56.179
[SPEAKER_07]: And they've got MAME working for it right now, so you know what that means I'm going to try to do?

02:51:56.961 --> 02:51:58.805
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, that's right.

02:51:59.427 --> 02:52:01.933
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be putting on the porno games.

02:52:05.241 --> 02:52:07.162
[SPEAKER_11]: All the gals panic I can possibly handle.

02:52:07.462 --> 02:52:09.623
[SPEAKER_11]: More to look forward on that on the podcast.

02:52:09.663 --> 02:52:10.583
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, check out the podcast.

02:52:10.603 --> 02:52:11.424
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, check it out.

02:52:12.444 --> 02:52:13.444
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to do this story.

02:52:13.484 --> 02:52:15.505
[SPEAKER_11]: It's something you actually posted at the site earlier this week.

02:52:15.545 --> 02:52:16.606
[SPEAKER_11]: This is too damn good.

02:52:16.646 --> 02:52:20.967
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't believe we haven't brought this up on the show earlier because we probably could have gone off for about a half hour on it.

02:52:21.587 --> 02:52:22.968
[SPEAKER_11]: You posted something on Tuesday.

02:52:23.028 --> 02:52:27.350
[SPEAKER_11]: It has to do with Dance Dance Revolution being mixed with fire.

02:52:27.790 --> 02:52:28.090
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

02:52:29.030 --> 02:52:30.291
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, Jamie, don't get too excited.

02:52:33.478 --> 02:52:41.987
[SPEAKER_11]: Dance Dance Immolation is the name of the game here and you can actually go to this website here and the way this works, what is Dance Dance Immolation?

02:52:42.548 --> 02:52:50.997
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an adaptation, this is from the website interpretivearsen.com slash ddi actually is the name of the site here.

02:52:51.677 --> 02:52:57.263
[SPEAKER_11]: Dance Dance Immolation is an adaptation of the popular arcade video game Dance Dance Revolution, but with fire.

02:52:57.843 --> 02:52:59.385
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, you play DDR.

02:52:59.705 --> 02:53:03.408
[SPEAKER_11]: When you do well, the computer shoots big propane blasts up in the air.

02:53:03.889 --> 02:53:06.872
[SPEAKER_11]: When you do poorly, it shoots you in the face with flamethrowers.

02:53:07.312 --> 02:53:09.394
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, you as in your actual body.

02:53:09.754 --> 02:53:12.237
[SPEAKER_11]: And yes, flamethrowers, like the kind that are on fire.

02:53:13.564 --> 02:53:16.768
[SPEAKER_11]: Now before you freak out here, this is what they say, wait, isn't this dangerous?

02:53:17.149 --> 02:53:26.702
[SPEAKER_11]: Before you play, you'll put on a fully aluminized proximity suit with a forced air respirator, gloves, fireproof hood, the whole bit.

02:53:27.022 --> 02:53:29.926
[SPEAKER_11]: These are the suits that are used for fighting fires at airports.

02:53:31.075 --> 02:53:35.839
[SPEAKER_11]: So basically, you suit up and you play DDR, but if you screw up, you get shot with fire.

02:53:36.079 --> 02:53:38.081
[SPEAKER_07]: Some more info on this.

02:53:38.161 --> 02:53:43.525
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, now the website right now, they just have their testing, their homemade flamethrower that they made.

02:53:44.366 --> 02:53:46.928
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not actually gameplay shots or anything like that.

02:53:47.389 --> 02:53:51.431
[SPEAKER_07]: However, there was another post on the DDR community in Live Journal.

02:53:51.451 --> 02:53:53.152
[SPEAKER_07]: They had some more pictures of the same thing.

02:53:53.572 --> 02:54:08.379
[SPEAKER_07]: But what's going to be happening is they actually have a computer running Step Mania with Firebase theme and Firebase songs, like Burning Heat, Burning Up For You, My Fire, stuff like that.

02:54:08.559 --> 02:54:09.679
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's going to be running Step Mania.

02:54:09.920 --> 02:54:12.541
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to play this, you've got to go on the Burning Man.

02:54:13.550 --> 02:54:14.471
[SPEAKER_11]: How appropriate.

02:54:14.591 --> 02:54:17.774
[SPEAKER_07]: Burning Man, and there's also some fire festival, I guess, in Oakland or something.

02:54:17.834 --> 02:54:20.116
[SPEAKER_11]: I never got Burning Man.

02:54:20.176 --> 02:54:23.899
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I understand it's a big thing that all these people go to the desert for.

02:54:23.919 --> 02:54:26.541
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't get it, so to speak.

02:54:27.942 --> 02:54:33.007
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if this is representative of what goes on at Burning Man, but let's just say you aren't selling any tickets with this, okay?

02:54:33.467 --> 02:54:39.472
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, this is the kind of stuff I would expect to see, like, on Jackass, but, like, I don't know, even crazier.

02:54:39.553 --> 02:54:40.714
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just waiting for the lawsuits.

02:54:41.836 --> 02:54:43.177
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think there'll be a lawsuit.

02:54:43.217 --> 02:54:46.318
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, these people probably do this with other crap all the time.

02:54:47.059 --> 02:54:52.141
[SPEAKER_11]: If people are stupid enough to suit up, I'm sure that they have disclaimers out the ass.

02:54:52.161 --> 02:54:53.262
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not talking about them suiting up.

02:54:53.302 --> 02:54:56.203
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm talking about stupid kids lighting themselves on fire.

02:54:58.304 --> 02:55:00.045
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they see this on TV or something?

02:55:00.305 --> 02:55:01.726
[SPEAKER_11]: Or they see this in action?

02:55:01.906 --> 02:55:02.886
[SPEAKER_11]: They see this on the internet?

02:55:03.006 --> 02:55:03.667
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess, yeah.

02:55:03.687 --> 02:55:05.988
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, maybe parents ought to, you know, take responsibility.

02:55:06.048 --> 02:55:07.289
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep fire away from their kids.

02:55:08.169 --> 02:55:09.670
[SPEAKER_24]: Parents just don't understand.

02:55:11.192 --> 02:55:12.493
[SPEAKER_11]: You know.

02:55:14.075 --> 02:55:15.757
[SPEAKER_11]: So, very interesting.

02:55:15.797 --> 02:55:18.560
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're interested in fire and DDR, maybe this is the thing for you.

02:55:20.122 --> 02:55:21.423
[SPEAKER_11]: Dance, dance, what was this again?

02:55:21.503 --> 02:55:21.964
[SPEAKER_11]: Immolation.

02:55:26.147 --> 02:55:31.789
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course they have a PayPal link on their site because, you know, you couldn't have this without a PayPal link.

02:55:31.809 --> 02:55:37.531
[SPEAKER_11]: And the festival that they'll be showing us at, the Crucible's Fire Arts Festival in Oakland in July.

02:55:37.871 --> 02:55:40.072
[SPEAKER_11]: Who knew that there was a whole festival about fire?

02:55:40.572 --> 02:55:41.953
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie, you should be going to this.

02:55:42.433 --> 02:55:46.315
[SPEAKER_22]: I would so... You know, I'm actually on the website right now.

02:55:48.515 --> 02:55:51.437
[SPEAKER_11]: I would be afraid that, like, in order to go, they would, like, shoot you with fire.

02:55:51.477 --> 02:55:52.437
[SPEAKER_22]: I know people who've gone.

02:55:53.067 --> 02:55:54.211
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh god, that scares me.

02:55:54.953 --> 02:55:57.401
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, fire's cool and all, but not when it's on me.

02:56:00.390 --> 02:56:07.056
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I want to do, like, Dance Dance, Hydro... Hydronization or something like that, where they shoot water.

02:56:07.076 --> 02:56:08.057
[SPEAKER_11]: How about a Super Soaker?

02:56:08.117 --> 02:56:12.280
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a little less harmful, but of course a Super Soaker gets on the pad and then it, you know, ruins the whole thing.

02:56:13.021 --> 02:56:13.641
[SPEAKER_11]: Softpad.

02:56:13.722 --> 02:56:14.602
[SPEAKER_11]: Slip and slide.

02:56:14.702 --> 02:56:15.923
[SPEAKER_11]: Softpad, there you go.

02:56:16.504 --> 02:56:17.585
[SPEAKER_11]: Slip and slide DDR.

02:56:17.705 --> 02:56:18.946
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, that's so cool.

02:56:18.986 --> 02:56:21.388
[SPEAKER_11]: You're tripping and falling on the bar and breaking bones.

02:56:21.889 --> 02:56:22.829
[SPEAKER_11]: Hilarious!

02:56:26.773 --> 02:56:27.033
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

02:56:27.987 --> 02:56:30.008
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's going to do it for tonight's show, boys and girls.

02:56:30.048 --> 02:56:33.129
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much for tuning in and listening to Orange Lounge Radio tonight.

02:56:34.090 --> 02:56:35.110
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got to wrap it up, though.

02:56:36.170 --> 02:56:39.452
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got a lot of stuff to do after the show tonight, such as tape a podcast.

[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to try to scare the shit out of you in my car.

02:56:49.276 --> 02:56:50.036
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, how so?

02:56:50.396 --> 02:56:51.016
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to drive.

02:56:53.638 --> 02:56:53.898
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

02:56:54.538 --> 02:56:56.879
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:56:58.634 --> 02:57:26.382
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, your final thought my final thought is I hope what they're saying about the PSP is true and then I'll be able to run homebrew games on Wednesday because I've got there's not that many games I want to buy and the emulators rock so go homebrew hoping for Stepmania ported to the PSP because I don't know because IndieGroove needs a PSP version or not

02:57:27.307 --> 02:57:28.508
[SPEAKER_09]: Miglitov, your final thought.

02:57:30.509 --> 02:57:34.011
[SPEAKER_06]: I like blue alcohol, blue DSs, and Russian boys.

02:57:37.514 --> 02:57:43.598
[SPEAKER_11]: My final thought is... I don't have one.

02:57:43.698 --> 02:57:44.078
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

02:57:44.138 --> 02:57:44.518
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have any.

02:57:44.558 --> 02:57:45.019
[SPEAKER_22]: Chirp, chirp.

02:57:45.139 --> 02:57:45.579
[SPEAKER_09]: Chirp, chirp.

02:57:45.639 --> 02:57:46.300
[SPEAKER_09]: It's blank.

02:57:47.640 --> 02:57:53.064
[SPEAKER_22]: My final thought is reject false icons and my car owns you all.

02:57:54.185 --> 02:57:54.425
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

02:57:55.154 --> 02:57:57.096
[SPEAKER_11]: for the last word of the show.

02:57:57.296 --> 02:57:59.038

[SPEAKER_25]: We have commenced our descent.

[SPEAKER_25]: I trust you enjoy this flight as much as you enjoy this accent.

03:00:24.206 --> 03:00:27.408
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, back on Earth, it's time for a down splash.

03:00:27.868 --> 03:00:31.010
[SPEAKER_23]: Into sea of eternal glory, my spaceship crash.

03:00:31.510 --> 03:00:34.552

[SPEAKER_11]: Alright guys, I promised that after the show we would play this one more time.

03:01:47.145 --> 03:01:49.547
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm actually going to play the original version of this though.

03:01:49.927 --> 03:01:55.812
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very similar to the DDR one, but it's just a little shorter, a little less instruments, but same idea.

03:01:55.852 --> 03:01:58.174
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you guys didn't get to hear this earlier, you'll still get an idea.

03:01:58.194 --> 03:01:59.995
[SPEAKER_11]: And those of you that did hear it, it's something a little different.

03:02:00.315 --> 03:02:07.201
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is the album version of the new song we announced tonight, because actually Spray was the first to announce this on their website, the artist.

03:02:07.941 --> 03:02:09.523
[SPEAKER_11]: I Am Gothic, the original version.
