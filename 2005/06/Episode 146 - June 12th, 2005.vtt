00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
Try to remember

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000

00:23.000 --> 00:25.800
The story we've got, been made to play

00:39.300 --> 00:42.000
Goodbye, Yellow Brick Mode

00:42.500 --> 00:45.300

00:45.700 --> 00:48.500
Goodbye, Yellow Brick Mode

00:49.100 --> 00:52.000
I wanna be your angel finger

00:52.000 --> 00:58.400
Goodbye, yellow brick road Do you remember the time tonight?

00:58.400 --> 01:01.400
Goodbye, yellow brick road

01:01.400 --> 01:05.400
I wanna be your angel, baby

01:31.400 --> 02:00.400
The following live program is a special presentation of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:00.400 --> 02:13.800
On tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio episode number 146, we're going to be debuting

02:13.800 --> 02:17.280
a new song from Ultramix 3.

02:17.280 --> 02:20.720
And the song that we're debuting, it's already been announced out there on the internet,

02:20.720 --> 02:22.600
just none of you people found it yet.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.960
So we're going to be blowing the lid on that one tonight.

02:24.960 --> 02:25.960
We've already got the songs.

02:25.960 --> 02:26.960
We're going to play that for you guys.

02:26.960 --> 02:27.960

My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Sky. Joining me as always are my awesome

08:20.320 --> 08:24.820
Go hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Ms. Jamie Summers, Dark Sakura.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
So who keyed my new car?

08:29.440 --> 08:30.720
What?

08:30.720 --> 08:34.840
Yeah, I don't know if there's already there, but it's very hard to tell cuz my car is silver

08:34.840 --> 08:38.040
Uh-huh, so it doesn't show up as glaringly as it would on any other color

08:38.040 --> 08:43.120
Oh, but I noticed it was like the light is reflecting in a funny way. I

08:43.920 --> 08:48.720
got a car and my car kicks everybody's ass twice and

08:49.360 --> 08:52.660
several times on Sunday and then like just

08:53.280 --> 08:55.280
Fucks all that shit up

08:55.280 --> 08:57.980
Well, I'm sure we'll be hearing more about that later.

08:57.980 --> 09:01.340
Also joining us tonight, say hello to Tech Masoloki.

09:01.340 --> 09:03.260
Hi.

09:03.260 --> 09:04.580
I finished my pizza.

09:04.580 --> 09:06.380
You finished your pizza and bread six nights.

09:06.380 --> 09:09.700
Sorry about the little hiccup there in the beginning, boys and girls.

09:09.700 --> 09:15.540
We accidentally had a router mishap, and something came unplugged during the intro there.

09:15.540 --> 09:17.540
We cut the wrong wire.

09:17.540 --> 09:22.020
Yes, basically we accidentally cut the wire that would blow everything up, because you

09:22.020 --> 09:23.020
know how in the movies-

09:23.020 --> 09:28.720
It's like you press the red button in an idiot mansion in the pool.

09:28.720 --> 09:31.960
Or for those that didn't play through that game, which would be a lot of our audience,

09:31.960 --> 09:36.200
because that game is kind of old. I'd always get just fed up and purposefully find the pool,

09:36.200 --> 09:37.240
drain it because

09:37.240 --> 09:39.420
the pool cooled the nuclear reactor,

09:39.420 --> 09:43.160
and pressing the button made it explode. I wish they would release that TV show on DVD or

09:43.160 --> 09:45.380
something, because I totally missed the TV show.

09:45.380 --> 09:49.160
Okay, anyway, my analogy. You know how, like in the movies, they always have the green wire and the

09:49.160 --> 09:54.740
red wire and you have to cut the right wire or everything will blow up, well we accidentally

09:54.740 --> 10:00.460
cut the wire that blew everything up.

10:00.460 --> 10:04.420
Moving on, we are back, hello.

10:04.420 --> 10:06.360
We got a fun show for you guys tonight.

10:06.360 --> 10:11.160
We even have a very special guest here tonight, but he'll introduce himself after the first

10:11.160 --> 10:13.880
break because we don't have all our listeners back yet.

10:13.880 --> 10:14.880
We had a mishap.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.960
Yeah, so we'll be back.

10:16.960 --> 10:19.920
So let's go to a break and when we come back, we'll get to the show.

10:19.920 --> 10:24.740
As I mentioned in the opening there, we are going to debut an UltraMix 3 song, a brand

10:24.740 --> 10:26.080
new song here on the show.

10:26.080 --> 10:27.700
Yeah, that's cool.

10:27.700 --> 10:31.380
And the thing is, is that it's already been out there on the internet, just nobody found

10:31.380 --> 10:32.380
it yet.

10:32.380 --> 10:33.380
But we did.

10:33.380 --> 10:35.580
So we're gonna unveil it to the rest of you guys.

10:35.580 --> 10:40.220
We're gonna point at the pink elephant in the room tonight and say, look, UltraMix 3

10:40.220 --> 10:41.220
song right over there.

10:41.220 --> 10:44.340
There'll be also some more crap we're debuting too.

10:44.340 --> 10:45.340
Like what?

10:45.340 --> 10:51.340
Well, what's it say on the CD here? There's two songs on there, and what are they?

10:51.340 --> 10:53.340
Interesting. Am I supposed to say now or later?

10:53.340 --> 10:59.340
We'll say it later, but there's two songs on there that have remixes to them now, and

10:59.340 --> 11:03.340
they're okay, but they'll never be released on the internet because they're B-sides.

11:03.340 --> 11:06.340
Alright, so tonight's the only time you'll hear them then.

11:06.340 --> 11:07.340
Well, maybe.

11:07.340 --> 11:10.340
Alright, let's go into this break, and this first break we're going to hear some music

11:10.340 --> 11:15.780
some music from DER UltraMix 2. Starting off with a song we were the first to blow the

11:15.780 --> 11:20.100
lid off of last year, about a year ago this time, so here it is. For those of you guys

11:20.100 --> 11:23.060
that are trying to get your friends in to listen, because we are going to be announcing

11:23.060 --> 11:26.780
that new song and playing the new song, we have it, we found a copy of it out there,

11:26.780 --> 11:32.540
so we're going to play the new song for you guys. That should be about 745, 8 o'clock-ish,

11:32.540 --> 11:36.980
just so you know, but don't just tune out and then tune back in then, because we've

11:36.980 --> 11:41.100
got loads of fun for you guys tonight cage match and stuff going on within the

11:41.100 --> 11:44.700
groove as well and all the stuff you know and love here at orange lounge

11:44.700 --> 11:51.700
Radio. We'll be back after this.

12:14.700 --> 12:17.700
And yet nobody knows

12:17.700 --> 12:20.700
Diddle, daddle, chicken chat

12:20.700 --> 12:22.700
Shoots in the breeze

12:22.700 --> 12:25.700
Put a clack in splutters

12:25.700 --> 12:28.700
There's a synchronous symphony

12:33.700 --> 12:35.700
Play from the familiar

12:35.700 --> 12:38.700
Conjure a search a jive

12:38.700 --> 12:41.700
Fidget in the mind

12:41.700 --> 12:44.540
Enjoy chats with no regrets

12:44.540 --> 12:47.340
Analyzing, hallucinations

12:47.340 --> 12:49.640
Wind a lick in the imagination

12:49.640 --> 12:52.480
Big hands, big hands, shadows dancing

12:52.480 --> 12:55.480
Here's a synchronous symphony

13:00.480 --> 13:02.780
Diddle-daddle, chin-shot

13:02.780 --> 13:05.080
Shootin' the brains

13:05.080 --> 13:08.080
Pat-a-clack, the cadence slatters

13:08.080 --> 13:12.080
Is a synchronous symphony

13:38.080 --> 13:59.560
Let me tell you something you don't know Let me tell you something you don't know

13:59.560 --> 14:27.560
Let me tell you something you don't know Let me tell you something you don't know

14:27.560 --> 14:34.560
If you keep those secrets, I won't go

14:34.560 --> 14:43.560
If you keep those secrets, I won't go

14:43.560 --> 14:45.560
I'm learning from you

15:15.560 --> 15:17.560
Thank you for watching!

15:45.560 --> 16:01.560
I was picked up for a TV show, it's called B-24

16:01.560 --> 16:08.560
I am the girl that you all know, to love, hate or adore

16:08.560 --> 16:12.560
I've been waiting for my life

16:12.560 --> 16:14.560
Trying to be seen

16:14.560 --> 16:17.560
Seen by everyone

16:17.560 --> 16:21.560
I wanted to be someone

16:21.560 --> 16:24.560
I'm better soon before

16:24.560 --> 16:28.560
Longing to be seen

16:28.560 --> 16:31.560
I'm not the bad girl

16:31.560 --> 16:35.560
I'll do anything

16:52.560 --> 16:56.560
I'm better than the star

16:56.560 --> 16:59.560
Longing to be seen

16:59.560 --> 17:06.560
I'm the silver girl I'm the baby green

17:06.560 --> 17:13.560
Like the blue stars Wanting everything

17:13.560 --> 17:16.560
I'm just a little girl

17:16.560 --> 17:22.560
I'll do anything you need

18:16.560 --> 18:18.560
Oh

18:46.560 --> 19:13.560
Hi Ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

19:13.560 --> 19:17.960
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

19:17.960 --> 19:24.040
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

19:24.040 --> 19:30.560
And we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 146.

19:30.560 --> 19:35.360
Off to a very interesting start tonight with some stuff going on there

19:35.360 --> 19:38.160
in the opening where we kind of disconnected there for a little bit.

19:38.160 --> 19:40.800
And now folks in the chat room are saying they heard Skips there

19:40.800 --> 19:41.600
in the last break.

19:41.600 --> 19:42.920
I have no idea what that's about.

19:42.920 --> 19:47.600
We don't show anything going on on our end, but I have no idea.

19:47.600 --> 19:50.840
So hopefully everything's OK.

19:50.840 --> 19:54.400
Anyway, tonight we are going to play a brand new song from Ultra Mix 3 for you

19:54.400 --> 20:00.080
guys, probably in about, I don't know, probably about a little over an hour

20:00.080 --> 20:01.640
from now.

20:01.640 --> 20:05.640
In the meantime, it's myself, Dark Sakura, and Loki here tonight.

20:05.640 --> 20:08.600
However, we do want to introduce a very special guest we have here tonight,

20:08.600 --> 20:12.040
one of our favorite folks to have here in the studio who hasn't been here

20:12.040 --> 20:16.040
In a while, might I add, I want you to introduce ourselves for the listeners.

20:16.040 --> 20:22.040
Hi, it's Miklotov, Seagurd, whatever you want to call me.

20:22.040 --> 20:23.040
What's up?

20:23.040 --> 20:24.040
Hey, how you doing?

20:24.040 --> 20:26.040
I'm good, good, good, yeah.

20:26.040 --> 20:28.040
So, back at the ol' Konami now?

20:28.040 --> 20:29.040
Yeah.

20:29.040 --> 20:30.040
How's it going?

20:30.040 --> 20:32.040
Pretty good.

20:32.040 --> 20:35.040
Yeah, that's all I can say about that.

20:35.040 --> 20:38.040
Yeah, I know, you can't really say anything, can you?

20:38.040 --> 20:39.040
No, no I can't.

20:39.040 --> 20:41.040
Ah, that's a bummer.

20:41.040 --> 20:44.600
to at least see the new stuff that we're all excited about?

20:44.600 --> 20:47.040
I don't know, it's a little thing called NDA.

20:47.040 --> 20:50.400
Ah, you can't even say that.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.720
Alright, well, that's too bad.

20:52.720 --> 20:54.000
Which means that's a...

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
What?

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
That means yes, he has.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
That's exactly what that means.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Is that no means yes?

20:59.000 --> 21:03.320
Because it would have been a no, otherwise, not, I can't talk about that.

21:03.320 --> 21:08.160
Hey, let's use some reverse psychology to figure out some more stuff here.

21:08.160 --> 21:16.120
Every time I answer NDA, that means yes.

21:16.120 --> 21:20.560
Was somebody smoking crack when they put Butterfly on UltraMix 3?

21:20.560 --> 21:21.560
NDA.

21:21.560 --> 21:24.240
Okay, just curious.

21:24.240 --> 21:31.340
Alright, also I have to point out is that because we are disclosing a new song tonight,

21:31.340 --> 21:34.720
this has nothing to do with the coincidence that Miggletove is here because he is under

21:34.720 --> 21:35.720
an NDA.

21:35.720 --> 21:39.800
I didn't know about this till yesterday that you even knew about the song.

21:39.800 --> 21:40.800
Yes.

21:40.800 --> 21:45.720
As you will find out when we reveal the song, you'll find out why we're revealing the song

21:45.720 --> 21:48.960
and it will make sense how all the cards kind of fell into place.

21:48.960 --> 21:50.880
So we'll kind of get to that when we talk about the song.

21:50.880 --> 21:51.880
But it has nothing to do with the song.

21:51.880 --> 21:52.880
Was it GamePro again?

21:52.880 --> 21:56.840
It actually was not GamePro, funny enough, but it was an internet website that spilled

21:56.840 --> 21:57.840
in.

21:57.840 --> 21:59.720
I will say that much.

21:59.720 --> 22:04.720
And it wasn't a DDR-related website, so it's just a website.

22:04.720 --> 22:05.720
the website.

22:05.720 --> 22:08.720
Yes, so we'll get to that a little later.

22:08.720 --> 22:11.560
So we're going to get to that, but first we've got to start off the show with a little bit

22:11.560 --> 22:15.920
of how was your week, how was your day, and DarkStalker, I know you're dying to tell us

22:15.920 --> 22:16.920
all about the new vehicle.

22:16.920 --> 22:17.920
Yeah.

22:17.920 --> 22:18.920
So how was your week, how was your day?

22:18.920 --> 22:22.200
The rest of the week I could give a rat's ass about.

22:22.200 --> 22:26.360
We went on Friday to one of the Mitsubishi dealerships in town because I had settled

22:26.360 --> 22:33.520
on getting a Lancer, and they gave us a good deal on a not too exciting 2004, you know,

22:33.520 --> 22:36.200
It only had like 5,000 miles on it, so it was really good.

22:36.200 --> 22:37.920
It had all the options, everything else.

22:37.920 --> 22:39.520
Like, OK, this is nice.

22:39.520 --> 22:41.040
And then we went to Fairfield.

22:41.040 --> 22:49.240
And they had a 2002 Lancer OZ Rally Edition,

22:49.240 --> 22:51.000
which is what I wanted.

22:51.000 --> 22:55.480
And the thing about it is that this has,

22:55.480 --> 22:57.160
is basically, when I think Lancer,

22:57.160 --> 23:00.400
this is the car I think of, it has the logo and wide letters

23:00.400 --> 23:02.440
across the back instead of just eensy tiny

23:02.440 --> 23:07.880
the bottom of the trunk and has the you know the custom rims for the for that

23:07.880 --> 23:13.960
model has all the bells and whistles it's automatic on top of it we did look

23:13.960 --> 23:18.400
at an it out of that evolution and there's no way I could perfecting afford

23:18.400 --> 23:23.520
that car but hey I also got a warranty on it that's basically the warranty for

23:23.520 --> 23:28.840
a brand new car on a 2002 model so basically I'll have an old car with a

23:28.840 --> 23:30.560
a brand new warranty on it.

23:30.560 --> 23:32.000
And it's fabulous.

23:32.000 --> 23:32.640
It's silver.

23:32.640 --> 23:34.920
It only has a little ding on the sender,

23:34.920 --> 23:37.240
and then I found the scratch on the door.

23:37.240 --> 23:39.120
But it's fast.

23:39.120 --> 23:43.680
It goes from 0 to 60 in less than three seconds.

23:43.680 --> 23:46.200
How fast have you taken it so far?

23:46.200 --> 23:50.220
Ben took it to 95.

23:50.220 --> 23:53.120
He got challenged on Roosevelt Road driving my car last night.

23:53.120 --> 23:53.840
To a race?

23:53.840 --> 23:55.000
Yes, to a race by it.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.800
He passed them civic, and he just swooped right down

23:57.800 --> 23:58.760
in front of them.

23:58.760 --> 24:02.460
and so the guy in the city started flashing his lights like he wanted to race

24:02.460 --> 24:04.900
and then pulled up in the lane beside him

24:04.900 --> 24:09.400
but Dan said he might have done it but I would have had his balls for breakfast

24:09.400 --> 24:11.760
or at least I would have fed it to him for breakfast

24:11.760 --> 24:16.000
so good boy. Tie the car around a tree the first day out, that's a great idea

24:16.000 --> 24:19.760
yeah, especially since that, from that area

24:19.760 --> 24:25.680
of Roseville Road goes to one lane. Yeah, not smart

24:25.680 --> 24:27.680
My week has been car.

24:27.680 --> 24:29.680
Oh yeah, and I got an iPod.

24:29.680 --> 24:30.680
It was free.

24:30.680 --> 24:32.680
So the free iPod site actually worked?

24:32.680 --> 24:33.680
Yes.

24:33.680 --> 24:35.680
Is there an engraving on the thing that says freeipods.com or whatever?

24:35.680 --> 24:37.680
No, it's just an iPod.

24:37.680 --> 24:38.680
Nice!

24:38.680 --> 24:39.680
How many gigs?

24:39.680 --> 24:40.680
Twenty.

24:40.680 --> 24:41.680
Alright.

24:41.680 --> 24:42.680
And an FM tuner now.

24:42.680 --> 24:43.680
How much have you filled it up already?

24:43.680 --> 24:44.680
About ten.

24:44.680 --> 24:51.680
And I have a 28 gigabyte collection, so I was taking off all the stuff that I never

24:51.680 --> 24:53.680
listen to but play for other people.

24:53.680 --> 24:54.680
Right on.

24:54.680 --> 24:57.180
none of my bimani music is in it except for all my taco stuff.

24:57.180 --> 24:59.680
You know what's interesting? None of my bimani music is in my iPod either.

24:59.680 --> 25:01.680
I have some of the long versions.

25:01.680 --> 25:04.680
Yeah, me too. I have, like, some long versions. Like,

25:04.680 --> 25:07.680
I have Conga feelin' in there, because you have to have Conga feelin', obviously.

25:07.680 --> 25:12.680
Um, and very few others. I have a couple Loki remixes, funny enough, which are, you know,

25:12.680 --> 25:14.180
somewhat bimani-related, I suppose.

25:14.180 --> 25:15.680
Is Celica only goes to 101?

25:15.680 --> 25:16.680
Pfft!

25:18.680 --> 25:22.180
We only- he only took the car that fast just because of the road.

25:22.180 --> 25:31.540
The guy in the dealership said he got it going at 130 and still had room.

25:31.540 --> 25:34.180
I'm just making a promise in the chat room.

25:34.180 --> 25:35.180
Interesting comment.

25:35.180 --> 25:38.340
Speaking of our chat room, why don't you join at www.orangelandreo.com, click on chat.

25:38.340 --> 25:40.180
We've got a lot of interesting folks in there.

25:40.180 --> 25:44.820
Sepiroth1215 says, I'm thinking about doing the free Xbox 360.

25:44.820 --> 25:50.220
What do you think about that now that you have reaped the rewards of one of these free

25:50.220 --> 25:51.940
iPod.com sites?

25:51.940 --> 25:58.180
you think of? First of all, the Xbox 360 isn't going to be out for months. That's why I think

25:58.180 --> 26:02.660
it's weird that there's already all these banner ads for a win a free PlayStation 3 and it's like...

26:03.220 --> 26:07.940
The thing is, look at what type of offers they have, because I did the Blockbuster one,

26:08.500 --> 26:11.940
because you have to sign up for an offer and you have to get five more people to do it. Right.

26:11.940 --> 26:18.100
I signed up for the Blockbuster one, you know, it had a two-week trial on it. It takes them five

26:18.100 --> 26:24.180
days to confirm. They do not bill you until your free trial is up and you can cancel within

26:24.180 --> 26:25.180
your free trial.

26:25.180 --> 26:26.180
Right.

26:26.180 --> 26:28.460
So I waited until it confirmed and I canceled it.

26:28.460 --> 26:29.460
Right.

26:29.460 --> 26:30.460
No money lost.

26:30.460 --> 26:35.100
Right. That's what a lot of people do. So people wonder how do they make money off this.

26:35.100 --> 26:36.100
Well...

26:36.100 --> 26:39.140
Keep in mind as well that you're putting a lot of your shipping, your address, all that

26:39.140 --> 26:43.260
stuff on those sites that you're doing the offers for, they will sell your information.

26:43.260 --> 26:45.060
Yep. Absolutely.

26:45.060 --> 26:50.300
I actually got, and they'll spam your email box, so you have to, you know, basically get

26:50.300 --> 26:55.420
their physical address and send them an affidavit. Do not sell my information. Opt out of any

26:55.420 --> 26:58.140
sharing, because under privacy law they have to do it.

26:58.140 --> 27:02.420
Right. But, or just move on them, which is something you're going to be doing soon anyway,

27:02.420 --> 27:03.420
right? Boarding addresses.

27:03.420 --> 27:08.020
Oh, I guess that's true. Oh, the junk mail finds you.

27:08.020 --> 27:11.700
Is there a way that you can, when you put out your forwarding address, say, except for

27:11.700 --> 27:14.740
ipodfreestuff.com or whatever site you use.

27:14.740 --> 27:16.300
No. That's too bad.

27:16.300 --> 27:20.140
Although what I do want to do is take the junk mail one day and just put a big

27:20.140 --> 27:23.540
return to sender stamp on it.

27:23.540 --> 27:25.100
Does it really work?

27:25.100 --> 27:28.860
I haven't tried it yet. Or, one thing,

27:28.860 --> 27:32.620
there's free offer things, you know, sign up for this credit card.

27:32.620 --> 27:38.900
I used to chop up their offer and put it in the envelope and mail it back to them.

27:38.900 --> 27:40.340
That's great.

27:40.340 --> 27:42.500
do they still think that you are going to come in

27:42.500 --> 27:45.080
i used to rate the feast on mine

27:45.080 --> 27:47.840
uh... it's it to use for what defeat

27:47.840 --> 27:50.280
this p

27:50.280 --> 27:52.220
i stopped getting those offers

27:52.220 --> 27:55.480
yeah i used to send them fingers than they started showing up in chili bowls

27:55.480 --> 27:56.920
so i had to stop doing that

27:56.920 --> 27:59.320
uh...

27:59.320 --> 28:00.860
i'm not going to be funny

28:00.860 --> 28:02.660
anything else you're sure about your week

28:02.660 --> 28:04.340
you're not paid at all

28:04.340 --> 28:07.340
here at a not all right moving on it

28:07.340 --> 28:09.820
that's right and he gave up for our egos

28:09.820 --> 28:11.920
uh... moving on because i'll be able mike

28:11.920 --> 28:15.580

of it already

28:30.200 --> 28:32.080

28:32.080 --> 28:35.500
now aren't you worried about the meek look off their club like assaulting you

28:35.500 --> 28:37.380
s e g l that he said that

28:37.380 --> 28:38.380
no

28:38.380 --> 28:40.380
cuz i don't have a fan club

28:40.380 --> 28:42.200
i thought you had haters

28:42.200 --> 28:45.540
uh... you have haters why do you have haters cuz i'm a jerk

28:45.540 --> 28:48.660
you're a jerk um... you are but i mean you know

28:48.660 --> 28:49.580
uh...

28:49.580 --> 28:53.980
people still bring up the whole last year with the extreme threat how

28:53.980 --> 28:56.220
we gave them not real clues

28:56.220 --> 28:57.580
uh... but that was funny

28:57.580 --> 29:02.420
wah wah wah which would be even funnier if you guys don't give them any clues this year

29:02.420 --> 29:05.360
that would be hilarious

29:05.360 --> 29:06.440
uh...

29:06.440 --> 29:07.340
let's see we

29:07.340 --> 29:09.440
okay i just said that was my week uh...

29:09.440 --> 29:11.800
and then yesterday i got really drunk

29:11.800 --> 29:16.000
and i was on the floor a lot. Were you dunked? I was so dunked

29:16.000 --> 29:19.840
at one point i think i asked if i was black

29:19.840 --> 29:24.620
for the record boys and girls mikkel tov is not black

29:24.620 --> 29:25.620
uh...

29:25.620 --> 29:26.700
yeah

29:26.700 --> 29:28.720
and i was on the floor a whole lot

29:28.720 --> 29:31.820
and played drinking games and it was fun

29:31.820 --> 29:33.160
except for the pain

29:33.160 --> 29:36.760
of my stomach with alcohol but uh...

29:36.760 --> 29:40.000
Yeah, I haven't done much.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.820
I kind of... Oh, I picked up a blue DS!

29:42.820 --> 29:45.040
That's hot, because it's blue.

29:45.040 --> 29:48.760
And now I have to get Nintendogs for it, because Nintendogs is fun.

29:48.760 --> 29:52.000
You have to tell them the mall story, though.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.520
Because I got so much exercise in the mall today because of you.

29:56.520 --> 29:58.360
Oh, okay. So, EB has this promotion going on

29:58.360 --> 30:00.400
where you buy a DS and get Mario free.

30:00.400 --> 30:03.120
So you went to EB in the mall, which was on the other side

30:03.120 --> 30:04.940
of the mall from where we parked.

30:04.940 --> 30:09.080
get there i'm like hey i want a blue ds with free mario they didn't have mario

30:09.080 --> 30:12.140
and i was kind of sad and i was like okay i'll just buy it

30:12.140 --> 30:14.640
so i take an ad just

30:14.640 --> 30:16.660
i wanted to look at it and i bought the ds

30:16.660 --> 30:20.020
and i'm like maybe game stuff will match the ad and that's on the other side of

30:20.020 --> 30:22.260
them all so we go to the other side of them all

30:22.260 --> 30:25.300
i still have my blue ds from eb go in there

30:25.300 --> 30:29.780
i ask if they will uh... match the ad and he's like yeah if you have the ad with you

30:29.780 --> 30:31.240
which i did

30:31.240 --> 30:36.200
But I had this Blue DS that I had to go take back to EB first to get the money back for.

30:36.200 --> 30:40.060
So we walked to the other side of the mall again to EB, talked to the guy,

30:40.060 --> 30:44.440
tell him that I want my free games so I'm going to go to Gamestop. He was cool about it.

30:44.440 --> 30:47.400
And walked to the other side of the mall to Gamestop

30:47.400 --> 30:48.840
to get my

30:48.840 --> 30:52.360
Blue DS and my free Mario. And then I wanted a USB cable as well,

30:52.360 --> 30:54.260
but they were all fifteen dollars

30:54.260 --> 30:58.560
and they came with software I didn't need and I have one back in Kansas that's like

30:58.560 --> 31:01.800
a five dollar one but that's back in kansas

31:01.800 --> 31:04.540
and i could give anyone for free

31:04.540 --> 31:08.400
uh... i don't free now

31:08.400 --> 31:11.580
uh... that uh... that was it

31:11.580 --> 31:14.540
uh... yeah i got a lot of exercise them all today that's all i know these little

31:14.540 --> 31:16.940
skanks never perfecting it

31:16.940 --> 31:20.940
seven years old they look like they were performing to become future strippers

31:20.940 --> 31:22.100
is that it was

31:22.100 --> 31:23.840
and it was great

31:23.840 --> 31:26.580
and there is a lot of pedophiles that you could tell

31:26.580 --> 31:29.540
what was great is that the mall at the mall here they have one of those local

31:29.540 --> 31:30.860
news stations

31:30.860 --> 31:34.900
uh... that does their life broadcast from the mall or whatever so right next

31:34.900 --> 31:38.920
to that is one of the stores where like girls little girls can go and buy

31:38.920 --> 31:40.180
accessories

31:40.180 --> 31:44.340
makes not claire's with one some other store they were having a jury and stuff

31:44.340 --> 31:46.180

they're like seven years old so um yeah at a store I don't know what is so I

32:04.700 --> 32:07.700

32:07.700 --> 32:10.540
birthday party I don't know but they looked like little miniature Christina

32:10.540 --> 32:14.460

christopher making my roommate making a comment as we were walking by though he

32:30.860 --> 32:35.660
said something about like very loudly he said something like dirty whores and

32:35.660 --> 32:39.420
one of the old guys like clicked his tongue at him as if he was like

32:39.420 --> 32:43.660
tisking him that's funny

32:43.900 --> 32:47.580
yeah so most people do when they listen to this show

32:47.580 --> 32:50.580
Alright, anyway, Loki, how was your week, how was your day?

33:17.580 --> 33:23.460
Went to Target because she wanted a full-length mirror so she could see how she looks every morning

33:23.740 --> 33:25.740
So so he got her that

33:26.300 --> 33:31.300
And then I don't know why that's funny girls are funny and then and then and then what was it?

33:31.300 --> 33:35.980
We were wandering around looking for other stuff, and I'm like hey look. There's like one of those shower massagers

33:35.980 --> 33:38.540
I'm like you want me to get you one of those two and

33:39.460 --> 33:42.260
Or I forget what she said it wasn't like

33:42.260 --> 33:47.900
Like, um, she's like, oh, that's, that's right, um, she's all, what, what would I use that

33:47.900 --> 33:48.900
for?

33:48.900 --> 33:49.900
I'm like, masturbation!

33:49.900 --> 33:53.260
I said that really loud.

33:53.260 --> 33:54.820
And so, that was quite funny.

33:54.820 --> 34:02.860
But um, then also, let's see, what else did I do this week, uh, uh, watched a lot of X

34:02.860 --> 34:03.860
Play.

34:03.860 --> 34:06.140
Um, a lot, a lot of X Play.

34:06.140 --> 34:09.760
And now I love the little kitties that are on there, the sensor kitties.

34:09.760 --> 34:17.080
And oh yeah, I also mentioned that I tried pirating Seven Sins, and it didn't work because

34:17.080 --> 34:21.180
of the CD copy protection stuff, but I'm going to get the work eventually.

34:21.180 --> 34:25.280
Right now I'm working on Grand Theft Auto San Andreas for the PC, because that'll be

34:25.280 --> 34:26.280
fun.

34:26.280 --> 34:31.580
I do have a legal copy though for my Playstation 2, I just want to play it on the PC now too.

34:31.580 --> 34:38.960
So I say that's completely illegal, and other than that, I've been, I tried playing some

34:38.960 --> 34:45.440
final fantasy and the servers got dns attacked again again they haven't fixed that crap again

34:46.000 --> 34:50.880
thank god i quit but it's cool though because it was like right about when i was gonna go to bed

34:50.880 --> 34:57.440
and i was trying to figure a way to get out of the party i'm like oh that'll work so um yeah that was

34:57.440 --> 35:03.200
it all right my weekend my day well heck i mean miklotov just kind of stole most of my story

35:03.200 --> 35:06.960
because i've been hanging with him most of the weekend because i had i had to drive to the bay

35:06.960 --> 35:12.560
area to get them the other day and I guess that was fun driving by myself

35:12.560 --> 35:17.680
let's see what else getting drunk last night was kind of fun I actually drank

35:17.680 --> 35:23.320
quite a bit myself I actually got drunk I started drinking at about six o'clock

35:23.320 --> 35:27.960
last night and what was I having oh I had that Malibu and pineapple but it was

35:27.960 --> 35:31.420
about the equivalent of about ten shots of Malibu and then a little bit of

35:31.420 --> 35:36.140
pineapple in there so I started drinking that and I think I had down that whole

35:36.140 --> 35:39.560
thing by seven o'clock. So by that point I was pretty butt. And then I had a couple other

35:39.560 --> 35:46.800
miscellaneous shots. I was pretty much drunk by 7.30. Well, finally I think I sobered up

35:46.800 --> 35:53.440
and I was ready to go to the club about nine o'clock. No, stop laughing. By the time I

35:53.440 --> 35:58.840
actually got to the bar, I was pretty sober. Like not like 100% sober. Like I wouldn't

35:58.840 --> 36:03.600
try to drive a car or anything, but I was coherent, right? So I get to the club and

36:03.600 --> 36:06.360
I do I start drinking again because I want to get drunk again

36:06.360 --> 36:10.960
But then everybody kept leaving and nice was dancing and I didn't really end up getting drunk

36:10.960 --> 36:14.880
Just kind of buzzed which is too bad because that would have been quite an accomplishment to get drunk

36:15.240 --> 36:20.300
Sober and then drunk again all in one night, so I will just have to aspire to do that in a future week

36:21.720 --> 36:23.800
I've done it. I bet you

36:25.800 --> 36:28.920
Didn't you do that here on a show once yes, I did

36:28.920 --> 36:30.920
Oh! Yes, I did. Yes, I did.

36:30.920 --> 36:34.920
We have to do another drunk show sometime. We kind of missed the last couple three day weekends.

36:34.920 --> 36:36.920
Getting me drunk's expensive.

36:36.920 --> 36:38.920
It is.

36:38.920 --> 36:39.920
Let's find some cheap tequila.

36:39.920 --> 36:41.920
But that's nasty.

36:41.920 --> 36:42.920
What day is the Fourth of July?

36:42.920 --> 36:46.920
I'm probably doing...well, I don't know. I actually have had a hangover.

36:46.920 --> 36:50.920
Didn't you swear after the last drunk show that you weren't doing it again?

36:50.920 --> 36:51.920
Yeah.

36:51.920 --> 36:53.920
Hey! Hey here!

36:53.920 --> 36:54.920
Guess what?

36:54.920 --> 36:55.920
What?

36:55.920 --> 36:57.920
The Fourth of July falls on a Monday.

36:57.920 --> 36:59.600
I work for a bank.

36:59.600 --> 37:02.200
Alright, sounds like we have a date set.

37:02.200 --> 37:04.000
Uh, we're having a drunk show.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.600
You, me, and a bottle of tequila, I'll have a date.

37:06.600 --> 37:07.600
Hey, I got a-

37:07.600 --> 37:08.600
No.

37:08.600 --> 37:11.880
I will do a drunk show on one condition.

37:11.880 --> 37:14.600
The tequila is the good Gula Gave tequila.

37:14.600 --> 37:15.600
Know what you can do?

37:15.600 --> 37:17.600
How much is that gonna set us back, bottle?

37:17.600 --> 37:18.600
No.

37:18.600 --> 37:19.600
About twenty bucks.

37:19.600 --> 37:21.600
Get the crappy shit, and then get a Brito water filter.

37:21.600 --> 37:27.280
You pour- you filter it through a few times, golden.

37:27.280 --> 37:30.780
Some of our younger listeners are kind of lost in this conversation right now, and I

37:30.780 --> 37:32.780
say that's good because...

37:32.780 --> 37:34.940
You're too young to be drinking and chillin's?

37:34.940 --> 37:35.940
Yes.

37:35.940 --> 37:37.500
You should not be drinking until you're of age.

37:37.500 --> 37:38.500
Exactly.

37:38.500 --> 37:39.500
You gotta get the order of ages right.

37:39.500 --> 37:42.180
First it's illegitimate children, then it's drinking.

37:42.180 --> 37:47.340
So go get knocked up, then have some booze.

37:47.340 --> 37:48.340
No.

37:48.340 --> 37:50.820
Actually, the reason why we do the drunk shows, this is the reason behind it, because we can

37:50.820 --> 37:55.820
show you what an ass you will make of yourself when you're drunk, so it scares all you freaking

37:55.820 --> 37:58.820
kids out there and then not drinking because if you're listening to us going

37:58.820 --> 38:02.540
oh my gosh if I drink I'm gonna turn into that those idiots I could take

38:02.540 --> 38:07.300
Vicodin right now don't take Vicodin and then drink that's really really bad I

38:07.300 --> 38:11.660
don't think I can do it right now I'll have to have to do an all-nighter if

38:11.660 --> 38:14.980
it's gonna be a drinking show because I can't drive home afterwards we should do

38:14.980 --> 38:23.780
an all-nighter show oh my god that would great just like just like rent out

38:23.780 --> 38:28.800
things to talk about let's get me I'm so drunk let's get me to talk here get him

38:28.800 --> 38:34.200
drunk too and then he'll probably be able to get around that NDA so black

38:34.200 --> 38:38.560
miklotov what do you have for us now

38:40.040 --> 38:43.360
maybe we could get him to bring some of his co-workers up here we'll get them

38:43.360 --> 38:48.720
all drunk one of them's liable to spill the beans get Jason Enos up here there

38:48.720 --> 38:49.720
There you go.

38:49.720 --> 38:50.720
Oh, that guy was awesome.

38:50.720 --> 38:52.720
That's what we need to do.

38:52.720 --> 38:53.720
Tell Jason he needs to come up.

38:53.720 --> 38:54.720
We'll get him drunk.

38:54.720 --> 38:55.960
He should come on the show.

38:55.960 --> 39:00.520
We'll find him some liquor if you come hang out with us.

39:00.520 --> 39:02.520
Fun times.

39:02.520 --> 39:04.760
All right.

39:04.760 --> 39:06.960
Enough talk about things that will be happening in the future.

39:06.960 --> 39:10.880
Let's talk about things that are happening in the now, such as an upcoming break and

39:10.880 --> 39:15.720
an UltraMix 3 song coming your way in about 45 minutes.

39:15.720 --> 39:16.720
Eventually.

39:16.720 --> 39:17.720
Yes.

39:17.720 --> 39:22.440
And here's, like, a little bit of a hint as to tonight's song.

39:22.440 --> 39:28.440
When we discovered what the song was, I could do nothing but laugh because it

39:28.440 --> 39:33.800
really fits in with something we've...with a theme we've been having going on on

39:33.800 --> 39:40.040
the show for the past couple weeks. Like, it's so funny. I can't even...yeah,

39:40.040 --> 39:44.200
I can't...this is going to be so funny. I can't wait. I can't wait.

39:44.200 --> 39:46.980
it's just it's like the biggest coincidence ever

39:46.980 --> 39:49.960
uh... it's amazing

39:49.960 --> 39:53.080
uh... we're gonna start off this break since everybody was saying oh i'm sick

39:53.080 --> 39:56.960
of ddr ultramix 2 music okay we're gonna shift gears and we'll do a kind of break that we

39:56.960 --> 39:57.960
haven't done in a while

39:57.960 --> 40:01.480
guitar freaks drummania and i have the perfect song to start off this set

40:01.480 --> 40:03.320
from guitar freaks

40:03.320 --> 40:06.960
uh... ninth we're gonna hear seven seven seven

40:06.960 --> 40:10.960
we'll be back after this

40:10.960 --> 40:12.960
Little little mermaid

40:13.960 --> 40:14.960
Nobody wants to know

40:14.960 --> 40:16.960
Ain't no beautiful world

40:28.960 --> 40:30.960
I'm digital earth, digital easy

40:30.960 --> 40:32.960

42:30.360 --> 42:32.360
You've got a easy way

42:32.360 --> 42:34.360

Dalemu kare toshira

42:46.360 --> 42:48.360
Anano! Anano!

45:18.360 --> 45:41.360
Don't you know, don't you know, I've been waiting for you

45:41.360 --> 45:45.360
Don't you know, baby, you could show up right on time

45:45.360 --> 45:48.360
Can't you see, I've been waiting for you

45:48.360 --> 45:51.360
Can't you see, baby, you just wanna rise

45:51.360 --> 45:54.360
All the time

45:59.360 --> 46:01.360
So now it's thunder

46:01.360 --> 46:03.360
I wasn't free

46:03.360 --> 46:06.360
All I wanted was attention

46:06.360 --> 46:08.360
Party after party

46:08.360 --> 46:10.360
Beauty and money

46:10.360 --> 46:13.360
We were so desperate for perfection

46:13.360 --> 46:16.860
But you have made me feel so good

46:16.860 --> 46:20.360
If I could be closer to you

46:20.360 --> 46:22.360
I'd close my eyes

46:22.360 --> 46:25.860
In your arms, I'd be gentle again

46:25.860 --> 46:27.360
With you

46:27.360 --> 46:28.860
Don't you know, don't you know

46:28.860 --> 46:30.860
I've been waiting for you

46:30.860 --> 46:31.860
Don't you know baby

46:31.860 --> 46:34.360
Music's gonna thrive on time

46:34.360 --> 46:35.860
Can't you see, can't you see

46:35.860 --> 46:37.860
I've been waiting for you

46:37.860 --> 46:38.860
Can't you see baby

46:38.860 --> 46:41.360
Music's gonna thrive on time

46:41.360 --> 46:45.360
Don't you know, don't you know I've been waiting for you

46:45.360 --> 46:48.360
Don't you know, baby, you could drive on time

46:48.360 --> 46:51.360
Can't you see, can't you see I've been waiting for you

46:51.360 --> 46:57.360
Can't you see, baby, you could fly on a right on time

46:57.360 --> 47:18.040
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

47:18.040 --> 47:24.140
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 146.

47:24.140 --> 47:25.680
You want to have a contest to name your car?

47:25.680 --> 47:27.680
We'll have a contest to name my car.

47:27.680 --> 47:29.680
I thought you were going to name your car God.

47:29.680 --> 47:36.680
No, because then I'd start calling it, you know, like, every so often, deity or Jesus or...

47:36.680 --> 47:39.680
And when I say, oh my God, I'm usually not referring to your car.

47:39.680 --> 47:43.680
But I have a friend who goes, oh my car.

47:43.680 --> 47:45.680
Seriously, she goes, oh my car.

47:45.680 --> 47:49.680
Wow. That's pretty awesome.

47:49.680 --> 47:52.680
The bitch tickler is being suggested in the chat room.

47:52.680 --> 47:54.680
That's okay. That's okay.

47:54.680 --> 47:57.880
Wow, that sounds like a, um, like a hardcore band.

47:57.880 --> 48:00.380
If someone can- Like an industrial band.

48:00.380 --> 48:03.580
Live, it's Bitch Tickler!

48:03.580 --> 48:07.680
If someone can suggest a name for my car

48:07.680 --> 48:11.580
that fits in with my interests in my pretty, pretty car

48:11.580 --> 48:14.680
with those stupid key skirts on it, then

48:14.680 --> 48:18.680
you'll get something nice from me after I move. Maybe like a piece of the car?

48:18.680 --> 48:22.120
No! Fuck no!

48:22.120 --> 48:23.120
Mine!

48:23.120 --> 48:24.120
How about a dust ball?

48:24.120 --> 48:27.120
It's called My Car.

48:27.120 --> 48:29.120
And nobody gets a part of it but me.

48:29.120 --> 48:30.120
Alright.

48:30.120 --> 48:31.120
My car.

48:31.120 --> 48:32.120
We are-

48:32.120 --> 48:33.120
What?

48:33.120 --> 48:34.120
What?

48:34.120 --> 48:35.120
What?

48:35.120 --> 48:36.120
What?

48:36.120 --> 48:37.120
What?

48:37.120 --> 48:38.120
What?

48:38.120 --> 48:39.120
Rob!

48:39.120 --> 48:40.120
What?

48:40.120 --> 48:41.120
My car!

48:41.120 --> 48:42.120
Mine!

48:42.120 --> 48:43.120
I waited a month!

48:43.120 --> 48:44.120
Mine!

48:44.120 --> 48:49.280
We're still going to be doing the Ultra Mix 3 song.

48:49.280 --> 48:50.280
About 30 minutes.

48:50.280 --> 48:55.160
for now let's talk about another dancing game series. In to Groove. In to Groove was released

48:55.160 --> 49:00.120
I guess this week. I don't get the whole In the Groove thing. You know what's funny? And

49:00.120 --> 49:03.940
we went into both those game stores today and in both of them I completely neglected

49:03.940 --> 49:10.120
to check to see if In the Groove was in stock because I just... We went into GameStop three

49:10.120 --> 49:16.140
times and went into EB twice and none of those times did I bother to check for In the Groove

49:16.140 --> 49:20.340
Because that just wasn't the thing that was on my mind today, I feel bad.

49:20.340 --> 49:22.900
No, but, honest, you know, I

49:22.900 --> 49:26.740
would probably pick up In the Groove because, you know, I'm a dance game whore.

49:26.740 --> 49:31.060
But I don't have a PS2 American and I have yet to mod my Japanese one, so,

49:31.060 --> 49:34.820
and I don't know if I want to mod my Japanese one because I'm afraid of fucking it up.

49:34.820 --> 49:39.220
You'll fuck it up, don't do it. Exactly, so I think I'll just wait for the slim PS2.

49:39.220 --> 49:43.180
Well, actually, I don't want to have a slim PS2 because I want one that can put a hard drive in it.

49:43.180 --> 49:47.660
so I have to wait for those PS2's to come out. I already have it in the group. With all the suns unlocked.

49:47.660 --> 49:48.460
You already got it?

49:48.460 --> 49:52.700
Yeah, it's called Stepmania. I had it for years.

49:52.700 --> 49:53.660
What the hell?

49:53.660 --> 49:59.580
I'm not gonna buy it for the PlayStation 2. I already have it on PC for free.

49:59.580 --> 50:02.580
Well, this is the weird thing I don't get is that In the Groove was supposed to be

50:02.580 --> 50:03.580
released

50:03.580 --> 50:08.980
what, June 17th, and then all of a sudden... Here's what it is. Surprise! It's by June 17th because

50:08.980 --> 50:09.900
they realized

50:09.900 --> 50:17.220
I don't think Red Octane has quite the shipping capability as, say, like EA, so they ship

50:17.220 --> 50:19.780
as much as we can.

50:19.780 --> 50:23.220
That's understandable, but it's kind of interesting, because it's not kind of what you're used

50:23.220 --> 50:26.620
to seeing for video game releases, because usually it's like, okay, video games are going

50:26.620 --> 50:30.020
to ship this day to shelve the next day.

50:30.020 --> 50:33.140
The traditional game release always works like that, like if Zelda's going to come out,

50:33.140 --> 50:35.340
you know it's going to ship and then shelve all that.

50:35.340 --> 50:40.820
then Red Octane is just kind of like, well, in the groove, you know, it'll show up around

50:40.820 --> 50:45.380
June 17th. Maybe you'll see it a little sooner, but June 17th will be the last one.

50:45.380 --> 50:48.900
Actually, that's quite typical for games, except, you know.

50:48.900 --> 50:49.900
Really?

50:49.900 --> 50:54.820
Well, yeah, because it's like, yeah, this game will be out in the summer. Like, for

50:54.820 --> 50:59.380
example, let's just talk about Psychonauts here. That game was supposed to be out around

50:59.380 --> 51:04.200
May, and it's like coming out around July now, so it's been pushed back like four or

51:04.200 --> 51:10.900
five times so it's not surprising they just said no we'll get to you whenever

51:10.900 --> 51:16.020
so um because of the fact I don't have a ps2 American although I need to get one

51:16.020 --> 51:22.140
because I want in the groove and I want extreme two for and we love katamari and

51:22.140 --> 51:25.940
we are katamari you know and I got to pick up the dance games that I was

51:25.940 --> 51:29.620
pretty much leeching from Loki when I lived there so I gotta pick all those up

51:29.620 --> 51:34.020
again although I thought I owned one of those maybe not max 2 I think I did own

51:34.020 --> 51:40.260
Max 2 at one point. I don't even know where it is. Isn't that sad? Anyway, so I got to

51:40.260 --> 51:43.740
get a PS2 at some point. But in the meanwhile, those of you guys out there, you've already

51:43.740 --> 51:49.620
been picking up copies of In the Groove and you've been posting to message boards about

51:49.620 --> 51:56.780
what songs are being unlocked and when. And I believe, I'm trying to find out what the

51:56.780 --> 52:04.620
hidden In The Groove 2 songs were here. Somebody had posted a complete list somewhere in here.

52:04.620 --> 52:11.980
I'm looking through some threads over on itgfreak.com where they talk about In The Groove a lot.

52:11.980 --> 52:17.900
Liquid Moon is one of the songs from In The Groove 2 that is in the game. And I want to

52:17.900 --> 52:30.160
say tribal style is another one funk factory and incognito is that it or is

52:30.160 --> 52:38.720
that in in the groove one I don't even know I'm sure somebody in the chat room

52:38.720 --> 52:42.320
will be sure to correct me but I know folks folks over there were really

52:42.320 --> 52:47.880
excited about getting to play some songs from In The Groove 2.

52:47.880 --> 52:48.960
So that's kind of neat.

52:48.960 --> 52:56.880
I do like how they did that, is that they brought back some songs that are going to

52:56.880 --> 53:00.120
be in the next mix, like preview tracks, like they used to do the old DDRs.

53:00.120 --> 53:02.560
So how many songs have I got on lockdown before the game is good?

53:06.200 --> 53:09.440
You're ruthless.

53:09.440 --> 53:11.520
I'm never going to buy that game.

53:11.520 --> 53:18.720
Maybe if I get for free or something, but I'll never pay my hard-earned money for that crap.

53:18.720 --> 53:23.440
Instead, I'll buy, like, Dog's Life 2 or something.

53:23.440 --> 53:26.800
You're really bad.

53:26.800 --> 53:31.120
I'm trying to go to one of my other resources I know has this on. There we go, yes, it's

53:31.120 --> 53:35.080
Funk Factory by Money Deluxe, Incognito by Inspector K,

53:35.080 --> 53:39.560
Tribal Style by Ka, and Kid whatever with Wake Up,

53:39.560 --> 53:46.560
which apparently is getting really good reviews already so

53:46.620 --> 53:49.820
and i'm being corrected uh... liquid moon is not a song from in the group to

53:49.820 --> 53:53.300
it's just one of those ones that you could only play before in the non-stop

53:53.300 --> 53:56.220
mode how would i know that i don't play enough

53:56.220 --> 53:59.400
sorry to disappoint

53:59.400 --> 54:01.740
apparently can unlock modifiers as well

54:01.740 --> 54:04.200
uh... bumpy i think was one of them

54:04.200 --> 54:09.600
Does it have a modifier to make it a good game?

54:09.600 --> 54:13.440
I hear it has link mode with DDR, but they're not similar.

54:13.440 --> 54:14.880
Don't worry.

54:14.880 --> 54:19.480
Or does it have pump it up mode?

54:19.480 --> 54:23.320
Well, it does have hand plants, so I guess it's sort of similar.

54:23.320 --> 54:29.600
Does it have we are under the bedsheets with Endemero mode?

54:29.600 --> 54:30.920
No.

54:30.920 --> 54:32.540
Damn!

54:32.540 --> 54:36.220
Some folks in Chat Room were talking about before the show that In the Groove 2 is out

54:36.220 --> 54:42.340
and about apparently is starting to make its way out towards arcades, which kind of lines

54:42.340 --> 54:46.460
up with some chat that's been going on on the various web forums saying that In the

54:46.460 --> 54:51.460
Groove 2 is supposed to be shipping in this time frame early June, so In the Groove 2

54:51.460 --> 54:53.540
could be coming to an arcade near you.

54:53.540 --> 54:58.420
I haven't heard if it's new cabinets and the whole works or what.

54:58.420 --> 55:05.420
I'd imagine the Boxor thing had to go away, but there'd be no clear answer to the Boxor.

55:05.420 --> 55:12.420
Yippee! Oh my god, I can't wait! Oh, The Groove 2! It would be so much... Nope, sorry. Sucks.

55:13.420 --> 55:18.420
Well, look, I know you don't give a shit, and I know you don't give a shit, but there

55:18.420 --> 55:22.820
are people out there in the community that do care, so I'm just trying to report on their

55:22.820 --> 55:26.260
behalf, because from what I'm hearing, one of the folks in the chat room was talking

55:26.260 --> 55:30.140
me about In the Groove 2 before the show, and was saying that it's very polished, like

55:30.140 --> 55:34.260
it's much more polished, and now we get characters...

55:34.260 --> 55:40.460
You know, you can buy boots at the thrift store and polish them up, but it still means,

55:40.460 --> 55:42.580
you know, there's still boots from the thrift store.

55:42.580 --> 55:48.540
Yes, ooh, characters! Yes, there's hot new characters named Paige and Shemy in the game.

55:48.540 --> 55:52.060
We need Mr. Spanky! I'm kidding, I completely made that up. Don't

55:52.060 --> 55:59.640
in the hate mail please all right so in the groove twos out and apparently it's

55:59.640 --> 56:06.100
really polished and all the songs from in the groove one and then some including

56:06.100 --> 56:12.100
some DDR crossovers like Bambi and just some crazy stuff and novice modes in it

56:12.100 --> 56:16.420
now so should be interesting and maybe might change some of your guys's mind on

56:16.420 --> 56:21.300
in the groove Loki gonna give in the group to a try you got to be fair come

56:21.300 --> 56:23.700
You gotta be fair and balanced.

56:23.700 --> 56:26.300
Will you at least take a piss on it if it caught on fire?

56:26.300 --> 56:28.300
Stop it. Stop encouraging him.

56:30.300 --> 56:34.300
Fine, I'll look at it, but it's gonna be the same damn game.

56:34.300 --> 56:35.800
It's like, ooh, it's like red now.

56:35.800 --> 56:37.300
But it's a pretty new cabinet.

56:37.300 --> 56:41.300
But it's a new cabinet, and the fact that it's in a new cabinet means it's not DDR anymore, right?

56:41.300 --> 56:42.300
Because that's what everybody...

56:42.300 --> 56:46.800
That's what I'm reading on the interweb, is that it's in a new cabinet, so it's not the same game anymore.

56:46.800 --> 56:49.800
Actually, that's exactly what it means, because you know what?

56:49.800 --> 56:53.960
cabinets have this thing called jamma meaning i can put pac-man game in a

56:53.960 --> 56:57.720
normal stand-up cabinet or i could put pac-man game in a driving cabinet or i

56:57.720 --> 57:01.480
can put pac-man game in a goddamn guitar freaks cabinet it's still the same

57:01.480 --> 57:03.960
fucking game doesn't matter what kind of cabinet

57:03.960 --> 57:08.040
you put it in you know what it's like i just said in the chat room you know the

57:08.040 --> 57:12.920
first in the group was basically shit but shit makes the flowers grow so maybe

57:12.920 --> 57:16.440
if we bury this shit it'll grow something good you know the chat room is

57:16.440 --> 57:18.440
I'm not pleased with this track of conversation.

57:18.440 --> 57:20.440
Guess what? Too fucking bad.

57:20.440 --> 57:23.440
There's about five people here saying stop hating.

57:23.440 --> 57:24.440
Too.

57:24.440 --> 57:25.440
Too.

57:27.440 --> 57:29.440
Boo hoo.

57:29.440 --> 57:31.440
I said I'd give it a try.

57:31.440 --> 57:35.440
The first one had good music, but it was just DDR, only crappy.

57:35.440 --> 57:37.440
I tried the first one and it sucked ass. The end.

57:37.440 --> 57:40.440
It was, yeah, it was DDR, only crappy.

57:40.440 --> 57:41.440
And...

57:42.440 --> 57:44.440
I can't wait to see the review on X-Play.

57:44.440 --> 57:45.440
I want to see the next one.

57:45.440 --> 57:49.720
I can't wait to see it. Apparently it's been getting decent reviews. It's getting around

57:49.720 --> 57:54.280
the same scores. I don't know on what planet In the Groove looks better than DDR because

57:54.280 --> 58:00.080
it like gave me eye strain after one song. And I never got eye strain on DDR. Whatever,

58:00.080 --> 58:05.280
you know. For the record, I'm still of the school of thought here where In the Groove

58:05.280 --> 58:10.200
is just another dance game to me. I don't hate it, but I don't love it. Again, it's

58:10.200 --> 58:14.060
not as good as the fanboys say it is, but it's not as bad as the haters say it is. That

58:14.060 --> 58:17.420
include you guys sorry but I don't think it's as bad as you guys make it out to

58:17.420 --> 58:24.860
be I appreciate the effort it was bad I just said it was kind of not good I

58:24.860 --> 58:30.580
appreciate the effort they're trying to put into reviving the dance game

58:30.580 --> 58:36.820
community but I just think they made some mistakes along the way but that's

58:36.820 --> 58:42.260
okay I would have made mistakes too so we've made mistakes doing a radio

58:42.260 --> 58:59.260
It happens. So, anyway, if you are a fan of In the Groove, which apparently there are quite a few of you out there listening, because we're getting hate mail already, pick it up. It's out in stores at least by June 17th. It'll be there. But you might have it already. We just don't know because they're shipping it randomly.

58:59.260 --> 59:06.260
In the Groove is only surviving the arcades because there's no new DDR. That's the only thing. Once new DDR comes out, buh-bye.

59:06.260 --> 59:12.100
You know it's like I could take my hair and dye it purple does it change the fact it's going to grow back brown

59:13.300 --> 59:15.300
so you can't

59:15.700 --> 59:17.700
You know take DDR add

59:18.180 --> 59:21.820
Modifiers to it. It's still gonna. You know always play like DDR

59:23.820 --> 59:26.700
Whatever I'm done. I don't know right good I

59:28.420 --> 59:30.740
Still am gonna harass people at Best Buy though. Oh

59:30.740 --> 59:34.340
Oh yeah, they're doing this live tour thing, right?

59:34.340 --> 59:38.860
What's going on? Oh yeah, live tour, woo!

59:38.860 --> 59:41.580
You know what's interesting, and if you want to find out more information about

59:41.580 --> 59:45.940
this live in the groove tour or whatever they're doing, there is actually a website

59:45.940 --> 59:49.660
on MySpace, and this is interesting because this goes beyond just dancing

59:49.660 --> 59:52.820
games. I know we usually talk about mostly dancing games in the three hour

59:52.820 --> 59:53.620
show here, but

59:53.620 --> 59:56.780
this whole MySpace trend for promoting your games

59:56.780 --> 01:00:00.180
has gone beyond just the dance games recently.

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:04.320
Donkey Konga 2 has its own MySpace now which I think is very

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:07.960
I don't know, interesting? If that's the word to describe it.

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:11.840
We actually posted the links to both of these on our website earlier this week

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:16.880
not just the Donkey Konga 2 one but also a link to the Red Octane page on MySpace

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:21.040
and Red Octane has their own little section of MySpace.com

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:25.380
and in

01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:29.980
the MySpace they actually have posted all their live shows that they're gonna do

01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:33.820
because they're actually going to tour in the groove around, and I think this probably

01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:38.440
has to do with the fact that you remember on DER Freak a few weeks ago, they were putting

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:42.580
out a call to, they wanted, they were going to hire, I don't know, Fly Girls or something

01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:46.480
that were going to be promoting this game, helping to promote the game. Well, they're

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:52.860
going out on tour, and the tour kicks off June 24th at the Best Buy in Dublin, and then

01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:57.700
it goes on to Santa Rosa on the 25th, Roseville, which is the one near us, on the 26th, which

01:00:57.700 --> 01:01:01.900
is my birthday by the way, which means I'm especially not going to be there and it has

01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:05.340
nothing to do with like or dislike for In the Groove but I'm actually going on a company

01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:07.180
trip so I can't be there.

01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:09.780
Yeah, he's trying to get as far away from In the Groove as possible.

01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:10.780
Yeah, right.

01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:15.460
So it's going to roll through most of California, making stops at Anime Expo on July 4th and

01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:21.780
San Diego Comic Con on July 17th, stopping along some various Best Buy stores on the

01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:22.780
way.

01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:27.140
And then it's going to roll through some other conventions, no other Best Buy stores yet

01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:30.220
So if you're not in a Best Buy in California, sorry you're out of luck, but they're going

01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:35.460
to various conventions throughout August, September, October and November, including

01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:42.060
just a quick list here, Wizard World in Chicago, Otacon in Baltimore, Gen Con in Indianapolis,

01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:49.780
Dragon Con in Atlanta, AWA also in Atlanta, Onicon in Houston, Wizard World in Arlington

01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:51.840
and Gen Con in Anaheim.

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:58.700
when I thought anime expo couldn't get any worse I'm proven wrong so they will

01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:01.780
be taking that out so if you want to try in the groove maybe you haven't played

01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:06.180
yet don't take our word for it or not play the game yourself make your own

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:10.800
decisions you can go catch them out on the road and if you want to check out

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:15.860
the tour schedule to complete one for yourself www.myspace.com slash red

01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:23.060
Octane, all one word. So there you have it. So it should be interesting, to say the

01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:28.260
least. Alright, let's go ahead and we're gonna go to a quick break and then we're

01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:31.460
gonna come back and we're going to talk a little bit about UltraMix 3,

01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:35.660
specifically a brand new song in UltraMix 3. Also the cage match when we

01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:40.940
come back a little later and some more stuff. We got more news for you guys when

01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:45.540
we come back. In this break we'll do some music from 2DX. We'll start it off with

01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:51.220
little bit of Setsugekka from tent style. We'll be back after this.

01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:20.540
Yeah

01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:25.540
Yeah

01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:30.540
Yeah

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:32.540

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:16.700
Hi.

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:20.140
Hi.

01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:43.380
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because Real Radio makes Captain Jack cry.

01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:49.940
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, music there in that break from the 2DX series.

01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:58.580
it off was Ryu with Setsugekka from 2DX10 style, 2DX fist style consumer track C-R-A-C-K-ER

01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:05.820
by Guaashi and 2DX7 style 0-1 by Mr. T and finally 2DX Red, John Robinson, K-K-K.

01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:10.420
That was the last one you heard there in that break.

01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:12.900
Skypline is open, we decided we'd open it up a little bit.

01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:18.700
We are going to be doing the brand new song from DDR UltraMix 3 very shortly here, but

01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:23.700
I figured after that last little bit on, we were talking about the In the Groove home

01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:28.580
version, I figured there might be somebody who might want to provide a counterpoint via

01:11:28.580 --> 01:11:31.620
our Skype line, I don't know, so I am opening that up there.

01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:36.500
If you want to join us on the Skype line, www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on the little

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:39.940
link that says, interact with us, and that's how you can call in on the Skype line.

01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:40.940
But you know what?

01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:44.480
I'm not sure how interactive people want to be tonight, because I'm not seeing a lot of

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:46.500
our listeners logged in to Skype right now.

01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:47.500
They know I'm right.

01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:50.980
say we have

01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:55.420
well paris hilton chad is so outdated

01:11:55.420 --> 01:12:00.740
this is sad and I've got to admit it okay nelly was bored so she was watching

01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:04.700
get this um it was that uh

01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:07.320
oh god chaotic

01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:11.800
I saw way too many episodes of chaotic and what did it teach me it taught me

01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:13.500
that britney spears is a whore

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:17.380
and I've already knew that britney spears is a whore but

01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:18.940
She's just fucking like,

01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:27.940
Oh, Kevin Vetterman! Oh, Kevin! Oh, Kevin! I've had sex three times today! Three times! I'm a fucking whore!

01:12:28.020 --> 01:12:32.540
So that's, you know, basically what Chaotic is about. Now, I was reading just now

01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:38.820
that Chaotic's actually going to be debuting a brand new Britney Spears video at the end of the show.

01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:39.740
That's wonderful.

01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:44.900
So, you know, I figured I'd talk about that stuff. And I was watching the MTV Movie Awards.

01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:48.540
I don't know why MTV was on all weekend, but again, that Skype line is open.

01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:50.460
You don't have to talk about it in a group if you don't want to.

01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:55.580
But they had Jimmy Fallon hosting, which he's not funny at all.

01:12:55.580 --> 01:13:00.380
And then they had Nicole Richie, she was actually interviewing people on the runway.

01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:05.780
And it was really bad because she's just like, oh my god, you're so hot, oh my god.

01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:07.980
And it was just completely stupid.

01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:09.760
I really hated that show.

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:11.500
But for some reason, I watched it because I don't know.

01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:17.500
If your girlfriend feels like she has to watch this shit, leave the room.

01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:22.500
We're getting a call on Skype. Praise the Lord. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:27.500
Yeah, I think I was elected by the chat channel to call in and make him shut up.

01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:32.500
Well, we will do so. Loki, shut up. Tell him to shut up.

01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:35.500
Yeah, shut up, man.

01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:37.500
So, what's on your mind?

01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:45.580
Oh, drinking. Not much. Basically laughing at people as they bicker back and forth of

01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:49.340
which dance game is better. I'm kind of the neutral party in this.

01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:54.580
Now, you kind of came into listening to Orange Lawns Radio Live, I'm assuming from our podcast

01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:56.900
that we do, right? Where we talk about other video games?

01:13:56.900 --> 01:14:00.740
Actually, yeah. Somebody gave me one of the podcasts and I was like, hey, this sounds

01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:04.460
pretty good. So I tuned in last week and just liked it.

01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:07.820
Well, welcome to all our folks who've been listening to the podcast.

01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:11.020
We do do this three-hour show on Sunday nights, and since it kind of started

01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:14.860
about Bamani and music video games and music-based things, we still talk about

01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:17.260
them a whole awful lot here on this show, so

01:14:17.260 --> 01:14:20.220
it's something you'll get used to. There are a lot of really good music games

01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:23.740
out there, though. But we have been kind of trying to branch out as, you know,

01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:26.060
as you kind of saw last week. We talk about, you know, just

01:14:26.060 --> 01:14:29.900
whatever pop culture stuff, other video games we like, we, you know, get into all that.

01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:33.900
Bringing up anything Nickelodeon is insanely cool with me.

01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:38.420
That was kind of just a weird show last week when we just were getting into Nickelodeon,

01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:43.180
but hey, cool with me, chat room scene to dig it, so I'm all cool with that again.

01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:46.260
Pretty much anything old school in my book is really good.

01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:52.300
And there's this whole like six degrees of separation thing going on because if you think

01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:56.540
about it this way, you have Nickelodeon, you have that show Roundhouse, and then the guy

01:14:56.540 --> 01:15:01.740
on Roundhouse was the emcee at Konami's booth at E3 this year, showing off the new music

01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:02.740
games.

01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:08.740
We should figure out some kind of six degrees of separation with video games or something. There's bound to be a way to do it.

01:15:08.740 --> 01:15:12.740
Yes, we could connect anything back to, oh, we're really talking about Bemani, don't worry.

01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:15.740
But can we connect it to Kevin Bacon?

01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:16.740
Possibly.

01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:18.740
Oh, jeez, not Kevin Bacon, come on.

01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:23.740
Did Kevin Bacon ever make like a guest spot at E3? Well, okay, maybe like Gary Coleman was at E3.

01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:27.740
I don't know, was Gary Coleman and Kevin Bacon ever in a movie together?

01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:31.740
Gary Coleman was beating up people at the mall.

01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:35.740
Did Kevin Bacon do that? I don't know.

01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:39.740
Kevin Bacon has gone to a mall!

01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:43.740
As a person who's calling in who isn't too familiar with the dance and music games,

01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:47.740
what kind of news stories have been interesting you this week in the general gaming world?

01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:51.740
General gaming world, I'd probably have to, well, GTA,

01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:55.740
San Andreas is out on PC.

01:15:55.740 --> 01:15:58.160
I almost beat it and I just got it today.

01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:01.320
Wow, had you played it on PlayStation 2 or any of that previously?

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:04.120
Uh, I played it on PlayStation 2 and hated it,

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:07.860
because it was just... it just didn't feel right to me, so I got it for PC instead.

01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:11.500
I've heard a lot of bitching about the controls in that game, and I've played a little bit of

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:15.200
San Andreas, but most of my San Andreas experience was watching Loki play,

01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:17.640
because he's better at killing people than I am, let's just say this.

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:19.280
Let's play missions or a bitch.

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:23.240
Well, he also likes to load down the game with cheat codes, and then he'll just

01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:26.680
skydive with no parachute. I don't know, what kind of stuff were you doing on those flying

01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:30.880
missions? You used to, like, fly straight into the ground and all this crazy stuff.

01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:34.920
I wasn't doing that. I don't remember. I just, you can actually chop up people with a propeller

01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:39.720
if you're good enough. That's awesome. I would, but one thing I do remember from-

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:45.200
I would car surf and that was fun. One thing I do remember from San Andreas was

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:49.560
that the controls were a little, it was a lot for, like, a little controller. There's

01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:52.920
so much you can do in that game that the controls get a little convoluted because there's so

01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:57.140
much you can do with that controller. And I imagine if you can lay that out across a

01:16:57.140 --> 01:16:59.460
keyboard, it probably makes it a little more...

01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:00.460
No.

01:17:00.460 --> 01:17:01.460
Same.

01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:02.460
You think? What do you think?

01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:06.500
Well, yes and no. For the plane missions, having a joystick is very handy, except they

01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:10.920
made it so incredibly touchy on the plane stuff. Like, you'll just tap it and you'll

01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:13.140
automatically go craning towards the ground.

01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:15.340
So like playing Top Gun on the NES?

01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:16.780
It's all about...

01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:17.780
Exactly!

01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:20.100
It's all about the train mission, or the trainers.

01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:30.100
You know, yeah, that's what I'm interested in because I remember watching you play Grand Theft Auto Vice City on the computer and there was that code where you could hit a button and you'd make a car rain down.

01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:38.100
No, basically what it was, it was, it was, um, I set one button, um, special moves, usually there's a code where you can do, um, make all the cars explode.

01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:46.100
So I mapped that to one key, held it down and all the cars rocket into the air, then you let go and start running and dodge the falling debris and that's awesome.

01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:47.100
See that's the kind of cool stuff...

01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:50.420
Or you can drop like tanks and then you just keep doing a line of tanks.

01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:52.820
Yeah tanks, that's a big tank pile.

01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:57.380
That's the kind of cool stuff that you can do in a game on the PC that's a little harder

01:17:57.380 --> 01:17:58.380
on PlayStation.

01:17:58.380 --> 01:18:02.580
I mean they have a lot of these same codes on PlayStation but you can do more config

01:18:02.580 --> 01:18:06.580
and hacking and all that stuff on the PC so I think that's the real reason to be happy

01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:07.580
about it.

01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:09.460
You know what's quite funny is like up to like maybe last month or so they were still

01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:12.700
releasing new codes for Grand Theft Auto like in-game codes.

01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:15.700
Well that's a good way to keep your game going, you know, keep it alive a little bit.

01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:22.980
The console stuff, you can really go so far with it, but the PC, you always have where

01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:26.220
you can edit it and change it and add stuff to it.

01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:31.900
Oh, I was seeing, I saw today on X-Play, they were talking about Grand Theft Auto, I see

01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:34.780
you had two player missions, you can make out with guys in that.

01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:35.780
Oh, hooray.

01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:36.780
Yeah, unfortunately.

01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:40.300
They're talking about having a mini sex game in the PC version.

01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:42.780
Dark Sakura said the word sex, so I was interested here for that.

01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:43.780
The chat room's talking about it.

01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:47.780
I haven't found out how to do it. I've been trying to find out how to do it.

01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:52.780
What is up with the mini sex games lately? We had one in Fable. We had one in God of War.

01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:55.780
It was written into the code but disabled.

01:18:55.780 --> 01:18:59.780
It's written in the code but disabled for the PS2 version.

01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:07.780
So if they just transferred that over to the PC, I'm sure someone will be able to find the way to, you know, get rid of that so you can actually have sex.

01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:12.780
Who cares? It's stupid. I mean, have you ever watched Hooker have sex with you in the car?

01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:16.780
All it is is the car rocking and she's sitting there, it's just great.

01:19:16.780 --> 01:19:23.780
You can always do the really old sex joke and playing River City Ransom, you walk behind the girls in the mall and make it look like you're humping them from behind.

01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:26.780
Dude, can you post those pictures in our chatroom, DarkSakura? They might get a kick out of that.

01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:27.780
I think those are fake.

01:19:27.780 --> 01:19:28.780
Are they fake?

01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:29.780
I think they're fake.

01:19:29.780 --> 01:19:30.780
Oh, they are fake.

01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:32.780
Aw, man, you had me going for a minute.

01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:33.780
They are funny.

01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:34.780
Post them anyway.

01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:35.780
Alright.

01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:41.780
Well, Reznor, we gotta let you go because we're going to get to a song premiere that the Dance Game folks really want to hear.

01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:43.860
All right, well, you have a good one, all right?

01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:44.360
You too.

01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:45.520
All right, thanks for calling.

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:46.500
Later.

01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:47.980
All right.

01:19:47.980 --> 01:19:48.820
This is interesting.

01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:50.900
Now we've got folks that are tuning in that aren't

01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:52.180
used to the dance game stuff.

01:19:52.180 --> 01:19:54.780
So we've got to talk about the other stuff, too.

01:19:54.780 --> 01:19:55.620
But that's all right.

01:19:55.620 --> 01:19:56.580
I like all games.

01:19:56.580 --> 01:19:58.340
We're game fans first, dance game seconds.

01:19:58.340 --> 01:20:00.500
All right, let's talk about those dance games.

01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:02.820
We promised you about now we'd be talking about the brand

01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:05.460
new DDR Ultra Mix 3 song.

01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:09.060
Now, I told you guys earlier that Miklotov, even though

01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:11.120
he's here, you might have forgot he was here, because

01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:12.880
He's actually been playing the blue DS over there.

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:13.880
He can't stop playing.

01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:14.880
Hi, Miklotov.

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:15.880
How you doing?

01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:16.880
It's a mod.

01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:18.880
It's a mod you can download.

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:19.880
Oh.

01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:20.880
Dark Sakura says the second...

01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:24.880
I did a little bit of digging on this, and apparently it's a mod you download.

01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:26.400
All right.

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:30.480
Let's get to the dance thing, though, because they're impatient as it is.

01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:31.480
All right.

01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:35.800
Even though Miklotov here, he is not revealing this to you guys.

01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:40.120
He's under NDA, so he can't talk about it.

01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:44.920
But who can talk about it and who can talk about when their songs are in the games are

01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:47.320
the artists themselves.

01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:52.360
And sure enough, if you remember last year when DDR UltraMix II was coming out, we had

01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:59.800
TOY, I believe on his website, he had announced he was doing songs for DDR, Alien613 or whoever

01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:03.560
had announced they were doing a song for DDR, and they put the background of the song on

01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:04.560
their site.

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:05.560
I don't know how they got that.

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:11.920
Do you remember any other folks that announced their songs on their website before the rest

01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:13.840
of us found out about it?

01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:19.760
I remember it wasn't necessarily announcing songs that they did, but I believe Big Idea

01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:24.760
and Jesper Kidd or Kied both said that they were doing stuff for UltraMix on their websites

01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:30.120
last year, and lo and behold, apparently artists are doing it again this year.

01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:36.320
Alright, so, I know you're all dying to find out what the song is, but I want to remind

01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:42.400
you real quick that this ties into an ongoing theme we've had going on for a couple weeks

01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:43.400
here on the show.

01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:47.440
Loki just found it on the page here, he's laughing.

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:52.800
Loki, what is the theme that it's tying into here on the show?

01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:59.800
I don't know, I can't trouble me with that stuff because I'm so very sad.

01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:09.400
Are you feeling tragic? I'm so tragic. Oh my god, I am so tragic.

01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:13.560
Oh, my tortured existence. Alright, if you haven't figured it out yet,

01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:18.640
the theme that this song relates to is our gothic talking that we've been doing for the

01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:21.660
past few weeks here. The artist...

01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:24.100
Because girls' butts have a lot to do with being God.

01:22:24.100 --> 01:22:27.460
Yeah, everybody in our chat room was rooting for girls' butts. Sorry guys, this actually

01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:31.860
ties into another joke. I couldn't believe it when I found this. The artist that is doing

01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:37.120
this song is called Spray, and the song is called I Am Gothic, and they are claiming

01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:46.120
on their website, I'm going to quote from their website, their site is over at www.spraynet.freeserve.co.uk

01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:55.800
And I quote from the page, there's a section here that says DDR, whilst spray's dream of

01:22:55.800 --> 01:23:01.520
sound tracking something by ultimate play the game may never materialize, we have the

01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:08.040
genuinely exciting news that DDR UltraMix 3 on the Xbox will feature I am gothic, the

01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:10.440
2003 single mix.

01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:13.940
So we have a song by the artist spray called I am gothic, we're going to play them, it's

01:23:13.940 --> 01:23:17.900
actually available on the internet we got it off iTunes you can buy the song

01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:23.060
on iTunes we're gonna play it for you guys right now I guess ready for this

01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:27.800
now remember this is not the DDR edit this song is actually kind of long

01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:31.880
remember that the song is going to be edited down for DDR when they actually

01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:36.420
put it in the game so this song actually clocks in at six minutes and 30 seconds

01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:41.500
so it's a little bit long but I think if you listen to it you can kind of tell

01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:46.480
what parts will be in the game you don't you don't have to be me glitov to know

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:49.260
that you will probably able to guess all right here it is the orange andre do

01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:54.340
premiere of a brand new song announced by the artist on their website for DDR

01:23:54.340 --> 01:24:01.340
Ultramix 3. Spray. I am gothic.

01:25:24.340 --> 01:25:38.340
Death inside, candlelight, night is there in gloom

01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:42.340
I'm just now cruising, I'm considered a dream

01:25:42.340 --> 01:25:45.340
So far it's dark, can't you feel my pain?

01:25:45.340 --> 01:25:49.340
All are all the same, say I should make my way

01:25:49.340 --> 01:25:56.340
Cast a ghost brain to the center of my heart

01:25:56.340 --> 01:26:01.340
I am hopeless and found

01:26:03.340 --> 01:26:07.340
I am selfish, I am frail

01:26:07.340 --> 01:26:10.340
I am scary, I am sane

01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:14.340
I am loner, I am cold

01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:18.340
I feel special when people come following me

01:26:44.340 --> 01:27:09.700
I don't like your band, I don't put any effort in it, it's just how I am, I'm disturbed,

01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:12.200
I feel hurt, I'm intense, that's me

01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:16.200
Writing poetry in ecstasy

01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:23.200
I'm a mythic before I study the above

01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:30.200
Just admit you're terrified

01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:33.700
I am conflict, I am hell

01:27:33.700 --> 01:27:37.200
I am scary, I'm insane

01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:44.200
I'm a loner, I am cold, I feel faster when people go cold

01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:51.200
I am perfect, I am fair, I am scary, I am sane

01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:59.200
I'm a loner, I am cold, I feel better when people come for me

01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:24.680
I am public, I am pale, I am scary, I don't study, I'm a loner, I am cold, I see a factor

01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:26.680
When people throw songs

01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:28.680
I am coming

01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:30.680
I am terrible

01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:32.680
I am scary

01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:34.680
I'm insane

01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:36.680
I'm a loser

01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:38.680
I am cold

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:40.680
I am the best

01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:42.680
I am the best

01:28:42.680 --> 01:29:11.680
I am dolphin, I am cradle, I am scary

01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:17.680
I am scary, I am strange, I am wrong, I am cold

01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:21.680
I feel better when people don't know

01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:27.680
I am complex, I am dead, I am scary, I am strange

01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:31.680
I am loner, I am whole

01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:36.680
I didn't think you'd let me go, don't you?

01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:19.380
The world premiere here on Orange Lounge Radio, that brand new song from DDR UltraMix 3 as

01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:25.760
announced by the artist on their website, Spray with I Am Gothic, the 2003 single mix.

01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:27.880
Alright, so there you have it.

01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:31.340
Now remember that that song, if you thought it was a little long, don't forget that they

01:30:31.340 --> 01:30:36.580
do edit those songs down when they're put into DDR, so if you thought it was long, don't

01:30:36.580 --> 01:30:40.260
worry, they're going to cut out some of the extra parts there and just have the meat of

01:30:40.260 --> 01:30:43.420
the song in the game.

01:30:43.420 --> 01:30:45.300
So Loki, what did you think?

01:30:45.300 --> 01:30:46.300
I am gothic.

01:30:46.300 --> 01:30:47.300
It was okay.

01:30:47.300 --> 01:30:48.300
Yeah?

01:30:48.300 --> 01:30:49.300
Okay?

01:30:49.300 --> 01:30:51.420
It was okay.

01:30:51.420 --> 01:30:52.420
It's okay.

01:30:52.420 --> 01:30:59.580
I was laughing my ass off when I found out about this a little earlier this week because,

01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:02.700
That's because of how it fits into everything we've been talking about on the show lately.

01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:03.700
I know.

01:31:03.700 --> 01:31:04.700
I was cracking up.

01:31:04.700 --> 01:31:05.700
We're psychic.

01:31:05.700 --> 01:31:09.620
Anyway, the artist spray, I actually think they are very funny.

01:31:09.620 --> 01:31:12.060
Here's the interesting thing about the band Spray.

01:31:12.060 --> 01:31:16.700
I was kind of perusing through their website where they announced this fact that they're

01:31:16.700 --> 01:31:18.700
going to be in DDR Ultra Mix 3.

01:31:18.700 --> 01:31:25.300
And if you look at it and they talk about who they are, they are related to Ricky and

01:31:25.300 --> 01:31:30.620
Daz, who were formerly, let's see, Ricky and Daz were Space Cats, right?

01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:33.140
You've got to help me out here, because I can't keep trying to realize this.

01:31:33.140 --> 01:31:37.900
Ricky and Daz were Space Cats, and then Space Cats used to be Bus Stop at one point, right?

01:31:37.900 --> 01:31:43.460
So believe it or not, can we get him a mic, look, give him a mic.

01:31:43.460 --> 01:31:44.460
So wait, am I right here?

01:31:44.460 --> 01:31:46.700
Ricky and Daz were Space Cats who were Bus Stop.

01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:47.700
Yes, exactly.

01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:48.700
Right.

01:31:48.700 --> 01:31:49.700
Now here's the deal.

01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:54.020
Ricky, it says Ricardo, who is one of the folks that's in this band, Spray, is one half

01:31:54.020 --> 01:31:59.380
of pop production legends Ricky and Daz. Funny thing about Ricky and Daz, they're actually

01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:04.820
showing up in Neon FM with the Rhinestone Cowboy song. So it's really weird how this

01:32:04.820 --> 01:32:10.200
is all relating together, but when I kind of tie that to Bus Stop, it's like, wow, because

01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:14.480
that song sounded nothing like anything you would ever expect to hear from Bus Stop, so

01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:19.660
that's very interesting. I was having the Sandstorm flashback, so...

01:32:19.660 --> 01:32:25.260
Zachary you weren't a big fan of the song or it's all right it just generic

01:32:25.260 --> 01:32:28.820
well don't forget that it's gonna get cut down a little bit as well so it'll

01:32:28.820 --> 01:32:34.340
be even more generic no but the parts that go on and on will be cut down okay

01:32:34.340 --> 01:32:39.100
I didn't care for much of it honestly I mean it was okay I'd listen to it in the

01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:43.760
background but I've heard better hmm I I'm totally digging it I think it's

01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:48.860
gonna be probably one of the songs that's as hot as skulk in the mix I

01:32:48.860 --> 01:32:53.240
I don't know, maybe I'm just being premature, because I mean, we don't know that many songs

01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:54.860
in the mix yet, but I don't know.

01:32:54.860 --> 01:32:57.780
We found out Skulk pretty early last year too, and that turned out to be one of the

01:32:57.780 --> 01:32:58.780
best songs.

01:32:58.780 --> 01:32:59.780
Skulk.

01:32:59.780 --> 01:33:01.380
Bib Spray is my new echo image right now.

01:33:01.380 --> 01:33:02.380
Really?

01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:03.380
Yeah.

01:33:03.380 --> 01:33:04.380
Awesome.

01:33:04.380 --> 01:33:05.380
You know me, and you know me and Echo Image.

01:33:05.380 --> 01:33:07.040
Yeah, that's pretty big.

01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:10.440
Some of the lyrics in the song, let me read you some of the lyrics from I Am Gothic.

01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:13.300
Step inside, candle lights in my depressing gloom.

01:33:13.300 --> 01:33:17.180
I'm just no brooding teen, I'm considered abstruse.

01:33:17.180 --> 01:33:20.780
so spares being dark can't you feel my pain people are all the same they

01:33:20.780 --> 01:33:24.940
isolate my ways catch the ghost train to the center of my heart then the dark

01:33:24.940 --> 01:33:29.020
will rise again I am potent I'm profound then the clouds will part here's the

01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:34.540
chorus I am gothic I am pale I am scary I'm insane I'm a loner I am cold I feel

01:33:34.540 --> 01:33:40.700
special when people don't phone yay so I can't I can't get it is it like there

01:33:40.700 --> 01:33:49.960
They're satire of goth bands or are they poking fun at themselves or what?

01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:50.960
I don't know.

01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:55.600
I think it's just a satire because anything that's synthpop is now seeming to be labeled

01:33:55.600 --> 01:34:00.920
as goth and they are definitely synthpop so they might be making fun of that.

01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:04.040
Actually I went ahead, I like that song so much actually, I really really dug that song

01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:08.440
so I liked it so much I went and bought the album which they also have available on iTunes

01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:09.980
and there's some great songs on there.

01:34:09.980 --> 01:34:13.480
They also have a song called, now see Jamie would like this, and she's not in the room

01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:14.480
right now.

01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:15.480
I'll have to tell her when she comes back.

01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:20.480
But they have a song called, I Kill With My Car.

01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:21.480
Read a lyric.

01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:23.280
You want to hear a lyric from I Kill With My Car?

01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:28.600
Rubber on tarmac, grip the wheel, cold chrome heartbeat, stainless steel, come on baby,

01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:34.620
take that step, in front of me in certain death, I kill with my car.

01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:38.680
And then there's another great song on there called, Fashion Stigmata.

01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:44.600
Stigmata is great because it has singing children in it. Yeah, little British children that sing.

01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:48.520
Let me play, I guess I'll play little clips of these songs here real quick. Let me play

01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:55.520
like a little clip of I kill with my car here, so you guys can get a feel for this.

01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:12.920
You see where that, I don't know, it strikes me as like, I want to see like an old woman

01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:17.620
driving a car with that blaring on... They're poking fun at the goth thing, but they're

01:35:17.620 --> 01:35:22.000
goth themselves so it's like they're just I don't know I think Jamie said

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.100
something when she was in here earlier it kind of seemed to make sense it's

01:35:24.100 --> 01:35:27.880
like they are making fun of how people make fun of goths or something I don't

01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:33.640
know other song titles on the CD I keep missing the love boat and leave it to

01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:41.140
the girls boys all right one more little clip for you guys here this is from that

01:35:41.140 --> 01:35:45.000
fashion stigmata song because I think this song is freaking funny fashion

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:52.000
I'll try and get a clip.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.000
Give all your body, that's how it's all wrong

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:00.000
We're just a few friends, we're just a few friends

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Give all your body, that's how it's all wrong

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Oh, God, well, she could get really quite the same

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Collections change, my scars are made, and my knees are now out of shape

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.000
And I'm being sued by

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Alright, so there you go.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
I just can't get into this.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.000
You can't get into it?

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:21.000
No, I like the titles, but I just can't get into the songs. They're awful.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:25.180
awful. You know, we had to look... It's like an Uwe Voll movie. I mean, come on. It's like,

01:36:25.180 --> 01:36:29.720
it's like... Oh, that's harsh. That is harsh. It's like a good concept, but executed poorly.

01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:34.560
No, it's awesome. What's great is that they have a song called Child of the 80s, which

01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:38.420
is very similar to the I Am Gothic song, because it's like poking fun at like, you know, reminiscing

01:36:38.420 --> 01:36:42.480
of the 80s and everything. And we could have sworn when we were listening to the song for

01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:45.760
the first time that it was saying, suddenly everybody rapes me because I'm a child of

01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:51.120
the 80s but it's actually rates me it's where that little accent comes into play

01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:56.920
all right so there you go there you have it I hope you enjoyed check them out I

01:36:56.920 --> 01:37:02.160
personally recommend the band spray but it really depends on you know what you

01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:06.720
want make a talk I don't know is there anything you can tell us further about

01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:11.240
spray probably not but only personal thoughts on the band but you know I

01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:14.920
think they're my new echo image which means they're awesome and you can't say

01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:21.920
anything about him in the game, huh? NDA. Which is a yes! Which is a yes! Oh frat!

01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:27.200
Apparently I can say something. You can neither confirm or deny what they're saying on the

01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:32.040
website. Exactly. Well, I'm going to confirm it. No idiot would say that their song is

01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:36.720
in CD-R and then it's suddenly not there because they would look ass-tastic. But at least they

01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:41.960
got their song played on our cruddy little show, so hey! That's true. That's true. But

01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:45.060
it makes sense. I mean, I don't know if this is like a different drum because they're technically

01:37:45.060 --> 01:37:48.600
not on the different drum label. They're on this ninth wave records. I think it was ninth

01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:51.480
wave. I want to say what's the name of the label. They're on some different type of record

01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:54.840
label. So it's technically not a different drum. So it makes me think it's a license

01:37:54.840 --> 01:38:01.440
song. And you can't tell me. You're no help as to which one it is. But I kind of see if

01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:07.200
it is a license song. If we're following that little six degrees of DDR here going from

01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:11.520
bus stop to Space Cats to Ricky and Daz to Spray, it makes sense

01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:18.320
how we ended up from point A to point B. So, there we go.

01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:21.240
I'm curious what our chat room folks thought of that.

01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:22.760
They probably hate it.

01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:27.020
They're fickle. Some folks were saying...

01:38:27.020 --> 01:38:31.480
They were talking about Max in there. What?

01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:34.960
We did not pay attention, chat room. People don't come to the chat room to actually listen to the show.

01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:42.740
They go there to talk about, you know, other stuff, but, yeah, interesting.

01:38:42.740 --> 01:38:45.740
This reminds me of Bloodhound Gang's Discovery Channel song.

01:38:45.740 --> 01:38:46.740
Who said that?

01:38:46.740 --> 01:38:48.380
Reznor, this guy, just called us in there.

01:38:48.380 --> 01:38:49.380
No, I don't know who he is.

01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:51.860
I guess I can't make fun of him if I don't know who he is.

01:38:51.860 --> 01:38:55.620
But you did say earlier, when we were listening to this album in the car, you said it sounded

01:38:55.620 --> 01:38:58.100
like Eiffel 65, who did a remix of that song.

01:38:58.100 --> 01:39:02.740
One of the songs, the very first track on the CD, sounds a lot like Eiffel 65, and it's

01:39:02.740 --> 01:39:06.980
It's not a bad thing, because if you got over Blue, and you actually had their CD, it was

01:39:06.980 --> 01:39:09.180
a pretty good CD.

01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:10.180
So...

01:39:10.180 --> 01:39:11.180
Alright.

01:39:11.180 --> 01:39:13.880
Hi, Dark Sakura.

01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:16.160
You missed our chat about the band...

01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:17.160
Good.

01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:18.160
No.

01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:19.160
They have a song.

01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:20.160
I was waiting for you.

01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:25.000
I was busy holding back the flood and getting two of every animal.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Okay.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.320
I know it.

01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:30.800
There's a song called, I Kill With My Car.

01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:31.800
I need that.

01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:33.800
See? He was telling me about it.

01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:35.800
I knew she would come around as soon as she found out about it.

01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:37.800
Your roommate was telling me about it.

01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:44.800
I'm sorry listeners, but I have to do this for Jamie. I have to play the clip again, you guys. I have to do this.

01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:51.800
and

01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:06.620
i'd like to know a whole lot of candy that so maybe it's just the remix it

01:40:06.620 --> 01:40:10.880
because that was a remix the one that's gonna be an area that he stands for me

01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:14.880
that the original version of song is amazing it's it's uh... very what you

01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:18.040
say in the car edward scissor happened yeah i think that i think that the

01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:23.540
beginning of the song i don't think that sounds like a good time

01:40:23.540 --> 01:40:28.020
at the original something else against me

01:40:28.020 --> 01:40:31.540
now the president of the inner charity should just name your car killer i mean

01:40:31.540 --> 01:40:33.900
it's still the death of the right

01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:37.020
all right enough about the band spray report about enough but we hope they

01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:42.300
enjoy their 15 minutes while being in DDR. But you know what? Really, I haven't heard

01:40:42.300 --> 01:40:47.980
an album that made me laugh and just... I just really liked it. I really did. It's everything

01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:52.060
I like about music. It was synth-pop and it was funny. I mean, seriously, how can you

01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:56.460
go wrong? They have a song about, it sounded like being a stalker and then committing suicide

01:40:56.460 --> 01:41:03.220
and killing the other guy as well so you could be together forever. And that was pretty awesome.

01:41:03.220 --> 01:41:09.820
Alright, let's go to a break, and in this break, I'm in a very Akira mood this break,

01:41:09.820 --> 01:41:14.660
so I think we need to do some Akira Yamoka this break, so we're gonna do that, and then

01:41:14.660 --> 01:41:17.380
we're gonna come back and get into this nice cage match, and we'll take another call on

01:41:17.380 --> 01:41:20.500
Skype, if anybody's willing to call in, so I'll take a poll and chat and see if somebody

01:41:20.500 --> 01:41:21.740
wants to call in on Skype.

01:41:21.740 --> 01:41:25.560
We'll take your calls, get to the cage match, get to the FUs of the week, and all the other

01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:28.460
gaming news we can dig up after this break.

01:41:28.460 --> 01:41:29.460
Akira!

01:41:59.460 --> 01:42:02.460
Take a look at me, I'm a virgin

01:42:02.460 --> 01:42:06.460
Look at you, I don't want to make you feel

01:42:06.460 --> 01:42:08.460
I'm all built for being a bitch

01:42:08.460 --> 01:42:10.460
And I'm making up a deal

01:42:10.460 --> 01:42:14.460
How do you feel?

01:42:14.460 --> 01:42:21.460
Let me through, let me through

01:42:21.460 --> 01:42:32.860
Hello, you and I, we love you, we love you

01:42:32.860 --> 01:42:36.660
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday

01:42:36.660 --> 01:42:38.660
With the cynical boom in the back

01:42:38.660 --> 01:42:41.860
I say Friday, Saturday, every day

01:42:41.860 --> 01:43:05.860
Let me do, let me lose

01:43:05.860 --> 01:43:10.860
Let me do, let me lose

01:43:10.860 --> 01:43:24.860
Oh, you make love more like me, more like me

01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:42.860
Are you here now?

01:47:10.860 --> 01:47:29.860
This got too forever, the grain blast blows and the wind is dancing

01:47:29.860 --> 01:47:36.860
It would be a much better fight, with you, with me

01:47:36.860 --> 01:47:43.860
If you hadn't met me, I'd be fine on my own, baby

01:47:43.860 --> 01:47:48.860
Never felt so lonely then you came along

01:47:48.860 --> 01:47:52.860
So now what should I do?

01:47:52.860 --> 01:47:55.860
I'm strung out, addicted to you

01:47:55.860 --> 01:47:59.860
My body aches, now that you're gone

01:47:59.860 --> 01:48:03.860
My supplies settle through

01:48:03.860 --> 01:48:08.860
And they gave me everything you had and more

01:48:08.860 --> 01:48:10.860
You craved my happiness

01:48:10.860 --> 01:48:13.860
When you made me feel a toy in me

01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:17.860
Just smile, but now I feel your stress

01:48:17.860 --> 01:48:19.860
Love was never meant to be

01:48:19.860 --> 01:48:22.860
Such a crazy affair, no

01:48:22.860 --> 01:48:24.860
And who has time for tears?

01:48:24.860 --> 01:48:26.860
Never thought I'd sit around

01:48:26.860 --> 01:48:30.860
Round and round all your love

01:49:00.860 --> 01:49:05.500
it you missed it we premiered a brand new song from DDR UltraMix 3 it was

01:49:05.500 --> 01:49:09.220
spray I am gothic when we were talking about the band spray for a little while

01:49:09.220 --> 01:49:15.420
and maybe after after like at the very very end after the afterbirth we'll play

01:49:15.420 --> 01:49:18.020
it one more time for those of you guys that missed it so stick with us and

01:49:18.020 --> 01:49:23.380
we'll play it again for those of you guys that missed it is your mic on and I

01:49:23.380 --> 01:49:28.180
also reminded people on DDR freak that you know because I told them what it was

01:49:28.180 --> 01:49:33.260
was, and I reminded them that they can listen to it also on our rewinds that are on Friday

01:49:33.260 --> 01:49:35.060
on DDR Freak Radio.

01:49:35.060 --> 01:49:36.060
Very nice.

01:49:36.060 --> 01:49:37.060
Good plug.

01:49:37.060 --> 01:49:43.340
Actually, the rewind for this week won't show up till next Friday, because there was a boo-boo

01:49:43.340 --> 01:49:50.320
and one of our shows got delayed, so we're a week behind again over there, so yeah, if

01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:51.320
that makes any sense.

01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:56.040
Well, actually, this show will be on there next Friday, so whatever.

01:49:56.040 --> 01:49:57.040
But look for it.

01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:01.280
should, you know, always listen to the rewinds so you can relive your favorite OLR moments.

01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:04.160
That's right, they'll hear us talking about gothic stuff and they'll think that we were

01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:06.720
hinting at the song the whole time.

01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:08.000
I swear we weren't.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:09.160
We really weren't.

01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:11.560
I don't know how long...

01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:15.280
Spray doesn't have dates as to when they do updates on their site, so we don't know when

01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:19.240
they put that up there, but it probably wasn't that long ago.

01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:21.040
I figured out the connection too.

01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:22.040
Oh!

01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:23.040
What is the connection?

01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:32.040
the record label, which is quite small, called 9th Day or something, 9th Something Records.

01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:41.040
Anyways, they're a teeny, teeny, tiny label, and they only have a few artists, which all have really horrible web pages, except for Spray.

01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:48.040
And they're actually sold by none other than a Denver Drum.

01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:51.040
Oh, so I think you found the connection there then. Interesting.

01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:55.040
which means it's probably not a licensed song

01:50:55.040 --> 01:50:59.040
since if we ask miklotov he'll just say NDA which could mean yes

01:50:59.040 --> 01:51:03.040
he's grabbing for a microphone

01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:07.040
oh you look like you're grabbing for a microphone

01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:11.040
why are you even here?

01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:15.040
wait miklotov he wants a mic

01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:19.040
I'm here because I wanted to get drunk last night and I succeeded

01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:23.040
He drunk himself black.

01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:27.040
Alright. DarkSacker, are you going to say something?

01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:31.040
I think that someone needs to make a mention

01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:35.040
of the times for the rewind.

01:51:35.040 --> 01:51:39.040
I would love to, but I think it's six o'clock, I think?

01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:43.040
I don't know very well. You know what, though? I will check DDR Freak's schedule

01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:47.040
just for you guys right now, and have a look-see. In the meantime,

01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:50.040
DarkSacker, if you want to plug some other shows that we have on Orange Lounge Radio?

01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:54.040
Yeah, I'd like to plug one. Where's my gun? No, I mean...

01:51:54.040 --> 01:52:00.040
I do public the volume on Tuesdays with a music request show, except no one requests anything,

01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:07.040
except randomly going, we want to hear this song! And I don't have it, so I tell you to send it to me.

01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:09.040
Oh yeah, back to the show.

01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:13.040
Pre-show starts at a quarter to seven. Official time is seven.

01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:19.200
The show starts at 7.30, I go to 10.30 supposedly, except I've been kind of going overboard since

01:52:19.200 --> 01:52:23.200
I've been working a later shift at work the next day, so you never know I might go to

01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:25.320
3 AM.

01:52:25.320 --> 01:52:26.700
Very nice.

01:52:26.700 --> 01:52:29.080
And I play a lot of good music.

01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:32.360
It isn't necessarily video game.

01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:36.300
There are, and I know I keep saying this, but there are some new shows coming to Orange

01:52:36.300 --> 01:52:38.900
Lawn very soon.

01:52:38.900 --> 01:52:41.000
I will be coming back with a new show.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:42.240
Skye's voiced the game.

01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:46.240
I will be coming back with a new show very soon.

01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:50.240
I'm looking forward to it. It's going to be a little different from outside the box, but

01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:54.240
I think it'll be cool. You guys will dig it. I also know that there's

01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:58.240
another project that doesn't involve any of us. I know it's

01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:02.240
being worked on, and we're waiting to see what it sounds like

01:53:02.240 --> 01:53:06.240
to see if it's airable, but it should be interesting.

01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:10.240
I think we should play it even if it's not airable. Either way, it should be interesting.

01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:13.680
There's also another show that I brought up.

01:53:13.680 --> 01:53:14.680
Yeah, you've mentioned this before.

01:53:14.680 --> 01:53:15.680
Um, it's...

01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:16.680
I'm moving...

01:53:16.680 --> 01:53:17.680
Okay, first of all, background.

01:53:17.680 --> 01:53:19.960
I'm moving to a new house, so it won't be there for a couple weeks.

01:53:19.960 --> 01:53:24.220
Um, but there will be a show hosted by Dan.

01:53:24.220 --> 01:53:26.280
As in, my Dan.

01:53:26.280 --> 01:53:28.860
And his crazy GameStop buddies.

01:53:28.860 --> 01:53:30.240
That should be very interesting.

01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:31.240
GameStop talk!

01:53:31.240 --> 01:53:32.240
It's going to...

01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:33.240
We're in the only gaming store!

01:53:33.240 --> 01:53:35.880
It's going to basically be a...

01:53:35.880 --> 01:53:40.640
When the new stuff comes out, his show goes up, he can get it that day and play it for

01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:41.960
you even early.

01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:43.920
So that'll be very, that's going to be very cool.

01:53:43.920 --> 01:53:45.580
So something to look forward to.

01:53:45.580 --> 01:53:49.520
So we are branching out because I know my new show's going to be General Gaming as well.

01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:50.880
That's going to be very exciting, his show.

01:53:50.880 --> 01:53:53.720
We've also talked about other things, but yeah.

01:53:53.720 --> 01:53:59.400
There is definitely coming something to the station as soon as next week that's very exciting.

01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:03.120
It's not a live talk show, it's something else, but it's very exciting nonetheless.

01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:04.400
So I think so anyway.

01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:05.400
It'll be fun.

01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:10.440
show, if nothing else. I'm doing a special show later on, too, that's going to be fun

01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:15.640
and have nothing to do with our normal shows, but it just fits because it's nerdy and geeky.

01:54:15.640 --> 01:54:21.040
It's old school nerdy. I mean, like, old, old school. So, it should be a lot of fun

01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:25.280
and a little retro there. So, actually, for those of you that like old school, you are

01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:28.640
going to love the announcement we have this week. Hopefully, this week it's done. You

01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:32.640
are going to love this announcement. Oh, yeah. You will poo your pants. Maybe not, but maybe.

01:54:32.640 --> 01:54:33.640
That's good.

01:54:33.640 --> 01:54:34.640
Quite awesome.

01:54:34.640 --> 01:54:35.640
It's great.

01:54:35.640 --> 01:54:36.640
Alright.

01:54:36.640 --> 01:54:37.640
Anyway.

01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:38.640
So enough talking.

01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:39.640
Oh, I was going to mention too.

01:54:39.640 --> 01:54:40.640
Our website is awesome.

01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:41.640
You should go check it out.

01:54:41.640 --> 01:54:45.880
In fact, we've got a story now about Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories with pictures.

01:54:45.880 --> 01:54:48.000
Yeah, that's my pictures.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:52.240
Rockstar is ripping them off other people's sites, but not us because we rock.

01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:53.860
So we have pictures for you.

01:54:53.860 --> 01:54:54.860
Go check them out.

01:54:54.860 --> 01:54:55.860
It's pretty.

01:54:55.860 --> 01:54:59.320
We also have the final pictures from 583.

01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:00.320
E3.

01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:02.640
They're all up too.

01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:03.920
Am I in any of them?

01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:06.080
No, but a slime is.

01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:09.800
Yes, I finally got off of my ass and put up all the galleries.

01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:13.560
How many pictures total from E3 did you have?

01:55:13.560 --> 01:55:16.640
About 700 something.

01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:21.760
Let me take a look, I'll add them up.

01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:22.760
Talk about something.

01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:26.280
You can talk about how awesome I am?

01:55:26.280 --> 01:55:27.280
You are awesome.

01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:30.280
I am such a whore for the camera.

01:55:30.280 --> 01:55:31.280
Mostly awesome.

01:55:31.280 --> 01:55:32.280
Just kidding.

01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:35.400
I thought your story earlier was really funny about, because you came in here and you said,

01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:39.240
I was Noah and I had to collect two of everything and clean up the flood.

01:55:39.240 --> 01:55:42.600
You were actually being serious because my roommate spilled a gallon of water on the

01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:46.880
floor in the kitchen, so she really was gone during the whole spray thing.

01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:47.880
It's a problem.

01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:48.880
Yeah, I was getting sprayed.

01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:49.880
Thank you.

01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:53.680
Yeah, my roommate sprayed water all over the floor, so it works.

01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:57.320
These are the kind of hints you're supposed to do before the songs are announced, people.

01:55:57.320 --> 01:55:58.320
That's alright.

01:55:58.320 --> 01:55:59.320
Alright.

01:55:59.320 --> 01:56:00.320
Okay.

01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:05.280
Okay, Friday has 104.

01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:06.280
And Thursday...

01:56:06.280 --> 01:56:08.800
Which, by the way, like 20 of them are the PS3.

01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:13.720
So you can check out the PlayStation 3 from, like, every conceivable angle, because Dark

01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:14.720
Sakura got it all.

01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:19.200
I put five pictures of the, five of the best pictures on the story that I did, which I'll

01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:20.680
go back and link in the chat room.

01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:25.480
Just an overview though, all the PS3 stuff is on Fridays.

01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:31.800
Gunstar Superheroes, Magic Online, Kingdom Hearts, that's on Thursday, I have 263 images,

01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:32.800
various stuff.

01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:41.960
I also got the new Dead to Rights for PSP on the Thursday one, and, oh crap, I just

01:56:41.960 --> 01:56:42.960
lost the page.

01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:43.960
Oh, there we go.

01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:47.160
Yeah, this is brilliant radio here.

01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:48.160
And then for...

01:56:48.160 --> 01:56:50.560
Rob, where are your pictures?

01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:56.560
They're not up yet. I was just about to say, my pictures are still not up yet. I didn't take quite nearly as many as Jamie. I think I have maybe about 100 total.

01:56:56.560 --> 01:57:00.560
273 for Wednesday.

01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:05.560
Including pictures of army parachuting.

01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:10.560
But what I do have in my picture gallery that I will be putting up soon is I have pictures of booth babes.

01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:15.560
Because nothing says love into those booth babes like a gay man running around E3 with a camera.

01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:17.560
So you can look forward to that.

01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:18.560
I have something that tops that.

01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:19.560
What's that?

01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:22.560
I have a sexy picture of Shane.

01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:23.560
Do you?

01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:24.560
Yes, I do.

01:57:24.560 --> 01:57:25.560
A sexy picture of Shane?

01:57:25.560 --> 01:57:26.560
Right here.

01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:29.560
If you ever wanted to know what Miklotov looked like, you can go to the gallery right now and see.

01:57:29.560 --> 01:57:31.560
There's actually a full page of PlayStation 3.

01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:33.560
That's pretty funny.

01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:35.560
Oh, wow, there really is.

01:57:35.560 --> 01:57:36.560
It's kind of blurry.

01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:37.560
All right, anyway.

01:57:37.560 --> 01:57:38.560
You're doing the thumbs up.

01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:39.560
Oh, awesome.

01:57:39.560 --> 01:57:40.560
Okay, I'll have a couple.

01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:41.560
All right.

01:57:41.560 --> 01:57:50.560
Rob also has another picture. It's a sexy picture of me hugging Mario.

01:57:50.560 --> 01:57:57.560
I have a story from E3, actually. How Dan scared the living shit out of Miyamoto.

01:57:57.560 --> 01:57:58.560
How's that?

01:57:58.560 --> 01:58:03.560
He got up with this thing to be autographed, and just as Miyamoto was getting up to leave,

01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:08.560
he puts his hand on his shoulder, and he gives him this look of utter horror.

01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:12.560
And then Dan goes, thumbs up with a big ol' grin, and then he started laughing.

01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:14.560
So yeah, he saw him dancing.

01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:16.560
Wow. Anyways.

01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:18.560
Okay. Yeah. New subject, yes?

01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:20.560
Alright, we're moving on. Let's go.

01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:22.560
New subject. How about the cage match, boys and girls?

01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:23.560
How about?

01:58:23.560 --> 01:58:24.560
Alright.

01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:25.560
Woohoo!

01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:31.560
Tonight's cage match, the way it works, three songs put into battle.

01:58:31.560 --> 01:58:35.560
You guys in the chatroom get to vote for your favorite song,

01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:39.460
And the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's

01:58:39.460 --> 01:58:43.740
Bomani Music and Video Game program, which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week

01:58:43.740 --> 01:58:46.020
on this stream when we are not here.

01:58:46.020 --> 01:58:46.900
All right.

01:58:46.900 --> 01:58:51.580
The song that is the current victor is a song that has been in the victory

01:58:51.580 --> 01:58:53.140
circle for two weeks now.

01:58:53.140 --> 01:58:54.780
It's halfway to retirement.

01:58:54.780 --> 01:58:57.660
We haven't had a retired song in quite a while, so this might be, I'm sure Jamie

01:58:57.660 --> 01:59:02.420
would be thrilled, being the fangirl that she is, to get this song retired.

01:59:02.420 --> 01:59:08.540
it has to happen with your guys's help and you know Loki and I are gonna do our

01:59:08.540 --> 01:59:15.220
best to take it out so yeah yeah we'll see all right I don't know tonight I

01:59:15.220 --> 01:59:18.700
know what I picked and I know that your very last minute I don't think we're

01:59:18.700 --> 01:59:21.700
gonna be giving this song much competition tonight but you never know

01:59:21.700 --> 01:59:25.860
all right so here it is song number one a clip of last week's winner you only

01:59:25.860 --> 01:59:29.780
get to hear clip because you've heard this song already it's the gorillas and

01:59:29.780 --> 01:59:32.860
And the song is their next single from the album, Demon Days.

01:59:32.860 --> 01:59:33.980
It's Dare.

01:59:33.980 --> 01:59:43.980
Hold me now there, jump in the moment when you see it

01:59:43.980 --> 01:59:49.980
Jump back and forth, I feel like you were there

01:59:49.980 --> 01:59:53.980
Let's get out

02:00:23.980 --> 02:00:43.980
You've got the pressure on you, you just listen That's what you do, baby, hold it down, yeah

02:00:43.980 --> 02:00:58.980
Jump back and forth, I feel like you were laying yourself, working out

02:00:58.980 --> 02:01:06.980
Never did no harm, never did no harm

02:01:36.980 --> 02:02:03.500
All righty, that was song number one, two weeks, going for a third win tonight, Gorillaz

02:02:03.500 --> 02:02:04.500
with Dare.

02:02:04.500 --> 02:02:10.500
Alright, we don't get to rate that song. We're going right into the next one because it already won, so you already know it's good.

02:02:10.500 --> 02:02:21.500
Alright, the next song is my pick and I'm being really adventurous with my pick tonight because I really think that you guys are going to kind of be really weird with this one.

02:02:21.500 --> 02:02:25.620
But um, you know, I don't I don't know what to say like

02:02:26.260 --> 02:02:31.080
This artist is somebody I would never consider putting putting in the cage match

02:02:31.300 --> 02:02:39.300
but the production values on this song are surprisingly really good and to take a person like this and

02:02:40.260 --> 02:02:42.260
to produce a song

02:02:42.620 --> 02:02:43.980
that is

02:02:43.980 --> 02:02:46.900
Kind of infectious in a way. It's kind of impressive to me

02:02:46.900 --> 02:02:50.200
So therefore I'm giving it a cage match spin to see what you guys think of it

02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:55.080
And it was co-written by the chick from poor non blondes, which I think is cool. So cuz she's cool

02:02:55.080 --> 02:02:57.440
All right. So here it is the artist

02:02:57.960 --> 02:03:03.060
Brace yourself now don't hate this song just after I say the artist. The artist is Kelly Osbourne and

02:03:03.580 --> 02:03:07.740
This song is one word. Okay, so give it a chance

02:03:07.740 --> 02:03:13.540
Don't hate it just yet because it's kind of dancey check it out Kelly Osbourne one word here on the cage match

02:03:19.260 --> 02:03:22.500
See even my computer doesn't want to play it here. Let's try this again kids

02:03:22.500 --> 02:03:26.500
This is Kelly Osborn with one word here in the cage match.

02:03:52.500 --> 02:03:59.500
One word breaks the code of silence Silence tells me all I need

02:03:59.500 --> 02:04:16.500
One word breaks the code of silence Silence tells me all I need

02:04:16.500 --> 02:04:20.500
One word breaks the code of silence

02:04:20.500 --> 02:04:24.500
Silence tells me all I need to know

02:04:24.500 --> 02:04:28.500
One word, one word

02:04:28.500 --> 02:04:32.500
Tells me everything I need to know

02:04:32.500 --> 02:04:36.500
One world driven into madness

02:04:36.500 --> 02:04:40.500
Madness driven by the depths below

02:04:40.500 --> 02:04:44.500
One word, one word

02:04:45.060 --> 02:04:48.980
Tells me everything I need to know

02:04:48.980 --> 02:04:51.680
It's not the way that I want it

02:04:51.680 --> 02:04:55.020
It's just the way that I need it today

02:04:58.020 --> 02:04:59.760
It's not the way that I want it

02:04:59.880 --> 02:05:02.440
It's just the way that I need it today

02:05:06.360 --> 02:05:10.000
Wasn't mine, cause a thousand stories

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:14.000
The greatest stories ever told

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:18.000
One lie, one lie

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:22.000
Tells the greatest stories ever told

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:26.000
One man can't predict the future

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:30.000
A future journey into outer space

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:34.000
One man, one man

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:38.000
A future journey into outer space

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:56.320
It's not the way that I want it It's just the way that I need it

02:06:26.320 --> 02:06:30.320
After that, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

02:06:56.320 --> 02:07:02.320
It's just the way that I need it today

02:07:02.320 --> 02:07:04.320
It's not the way that I want it

02:07:04.320 --> 02:07:31.800
All right, that was song number two in tonight's cage match, Kelly Osbourne.

02:07:31.800 --> 02:07:33.400
One word.

02:07:33.400 --> 02:07:39.120
And now we get one vote from each person, actually not a vote, but one judgement, one

02:07:39.120 --> 02:07:41.320
judgement from each person here in the room.

02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:42.320
Dark Sockra.

02:07:42.320 --> 02:07:52.160
Um, well I heard this in your car last week, and I liked it, it's okay, it is though really

02:07:52.160 --> 02:07:58.680
repetitive, and she doesn't really sound like herself through all the synths and everything,

02:07:58.680 --> 02:08:00.800
which I guess might be a blessing in disguise.

02:08:00.800 --> 02:08:01.800
I think so.

02:08:01.800 --> 02:08:05.680
Um, it would be a background song for me, honestly.

02:08:05.680 --> 02:08:09.280
I'd give it a seven.

02:08:09.280 --> 02:08:11.640
I'm being really nice, I'd give it a seven.

02:08:11.640 --> 02:08:14.280
Me personally, I think it's great.

02:08:14.280 --> 02:08:18.440
Kelly Osbourne, okay, the rock thing really didn't work for her, so she can't sing so

02:08:18.440 --> 02:08:23.360
well, so let's find a genre that fits perfectly for people who can't sing that well.

02:08:23.360 --> 02:08:26.520
Let's revive 80s New Wave, it works great.

02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:29.120
So I like it, so I give it an eight for 80s.

02:08:29.120 --> 02:08:34.120
Loki, she needs to get her dad to fucking sing with her, because at least that would be cool.

02:08:35.120 --> 02:08:36.120
Honestly.

02:08:36.120 --> 02:08:40.120
I have a music file of Ozzy Osbourne doing Stayin' Alive.

02:08:40.120 --> 02:08:42.120
Oh my god, that was fucking awesome, I heard that.

02:08:42.120 --> 02:08:43.120
That was great.

02:08:43.120 --> 02:08:44.120
That was great.

02:08:44.120 --> 02:08:45.120
I gotta bring that in.

02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:47.120
All aboard the disco chain!

02:08:47.120 --> 02:08:48.120
Hello.

02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:49.120
I'm bringing that in.

02:08:49.120 --> 02:08:50.120
One word, one word.

02:08:50.120 --> 02:08:51.120
Oh, one word?

02:08:51.120 --> 02:08:52.120
One song.

02:08:52.120 --> 02:08:53.120
It was okay.

02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:57.120
It was just kind of, it was very boring.

02:08:57.120 --> 02:09:05.120
and I don't like Kelly Osbourne at all, and um, it was just kind of eh, it was just, I don't know,

02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:08.880
she could keep doing that same genre because it's not as bad as like say, I don't know, um,

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:14.320
Lala or something like that, you know, I know that's not Kelly Osbourne, but just as bad,

02:09:14.320 --> 02:09:21.520
and trying to be rock. That one? Yeah, oh yeah, okay. This 80s, this, not 80s, this pop rock

02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:26.720
crap that they're doing now, not good, okay, just crap, but it's good to see you're going

02:09:26.720 --> 02:09:31.280
in a new direction, so I guess they give it a second. Alright. Miguel Ataz, something

02:09:31.280 --> 02:09:36.720
you can talk about tonight for once. Kelly Osborn, one word. It was okay, um, kinda boring.

02:09:36.720 --> 02:09:43.720
I think that's the theme. Uh, six. Alrighty. Let's get into song number three. It's Loki's

02:09:43.720 --> 02:09:47.440
song and he refuses to tell me the name, so he will be doing the introduction. I will

02:09:47.440 --> 02:09:54.160
be doing the introduction. Now this song, it's a remix I actually finished today, um,

02:09:54.160 --> 02:10:02.160
I've been, you know, doing remixes now that I've got, you know, a Myspace, you know, community thing going here, so, um...

02:10:02.160 --> 02:10:10.160
I did two remixes today, one of them being a remix to Dropout, which we're not playing, and the other remix is to Skulk!

02:10:10.160 --> 02:10:14.160
This is Echo Image Skulk with, um...

02:10:14.160 --> 02:10:19.160
Oh god, what the hell was the name of this? It was...

02:10:19.160 --> 02:10:21.560
Nobody Understands Mix, that's what it was.

02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:24.260
Okay, so this is Skulk, the Nobody Understands Mix.

02:10:24.260 --> 02:10:24.760
Exactly.

02:10:24.760 --> 02:10:25.860
Interesting, alright.

02:10:25.860 --> 02:10:28.660
Any, uh, you want to talk about what you mixed it with, or later?

02:10:28.660 --> 02:10:34.460
It's just, it's a lot of different versions of Skulk kind of put together, and also some other songs and stuff.

02:10:35.260 --> 02:10:38.860
There's some things I would have loved to do to it that I couldn't do,

02:10:38.860 --> 02:10:42.260
and so, you know, I see all the flaws in it, you know, going into it, but it's-

02:10:42.260 --> 02:10:43.260
Way to sell it.

02:10:43.260 --> 02:10:47.060
Hey, I'm sorry, okay, because I don't want to just, you know,

02:10:47.060 --> 02:10:50.640
pop-out mixes that are just something you're going to see on BomaniStyle, you know, like

02:10:50.640 --> 02:10:55.100
some of the crap that's on there. So I'm really picky on the stuff that I want to release

02:10:55.100 --> 02:10:58.080
out there on the internet. That's why the dropout thing's not ever getting released

02:10:58.080 --> 02:11:03.880
on the internet. But we'll hear that later. Anyways, this is Echo Image, Skulk, the No

02:11:03.880 --> 02:11:05.880
No one here to stand, mix.

02:12:03.880 --> 02:12:31.880
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

02:12:31.880 --> 02:12:35.380
It's like the fragment of my soul

02:12:35.380 --> 02:12:39.880
It's the end, that's where I've become

02:12:39.880 --> 02:12:43.380
I'm falling like I always have

02:12:43.380 --> 02:12:46.380
Make me take control

02:12:46.380 --> 02:12:49.380
I'll be no different than she

02:12:49.380 --> 02:12:53.880
Making me feel like I'm back now

02:14:53.880 --> 02:15:23.860
All right, Loki there, remixing Echo Image with Skulk, the nobody-understood

02:15:23.860 --> 02:15:30.860
Let's see if the judges, us, were able to understand it, or we just didn't get it.

02:15:30.860 --> 02:15:31.860
Dark Sakura.

02:15:31.860 --> 02:15:35.860
It was overall good.

02:15:35.860 --> 02:15:41.860
I think that the music over Shadow, it was imbalanced versus the lyrics.

02:15:41.860 --> 02:15:43.860
It was actually pretty imbalanced.

02:15:43.860 --> 02:15:49.860
I thought that the beat itself on the first measure could have,

02:15:49.860 --> 02:15:53.340
could have at the beginning of every measure could have been a little bit

02:15:53.340 --> 02:15:58.060
more subdued because I started getting headache which is how I do it whenever

02:15:58.060 --> 02:16:04.940
any song does like that is so it doesn't matter what song it is it was so solid

02:16:04.940 --> 02:16:10.580
with a little tweaking it could be a 10 so I go right now I give it a 7 and a half

02:16:10.580 --> 02:16:15.900
bogey exact same thoughts because they have the same problems trying to pull

02:16:15.900 --> 02:16:20.700
just you know vocals out of there can't really do that if i don't have a vocal track but i work with

02:16:20.700 --> 02:16:27.340
what i got so you know i give it a nine um i you know i would think that loki and echo image

02:16:27.340 --> 02:16:32.780
colliding would be like an instant 10 but for me like some of it was just like too busy like the

02:16:32.780 --> 02:16:35.980
middle part of it was like too much like i think i felt the jamie thing was like oh my god there's

02:16:35.980 --> 02:16:41.820
like too much here um but i think for what he had to work with loki did an amazing job i think what

02:16:41.820 --> 02:16:47.020
it is is it's the beginning of a really really good mix and if Loki could get

02:16:47.020 --> 02:16:51.260
the original samples and stuff he could clean it up a lot and it would totally

02:16:51.260 --> 02:16:54.940
like just blow us all away it's hard because when you're working with like

02:16:54.940 --> 02:16:58.500
three or four different tracks that once mixed in together on top and only one

02:16:58.500 --> 02:17:02.600
has a vocal track pulling the vocals out there is impossible and I've tried the

02:17:02.600 --> 02:17:06.340
best I could to like subdue the other tracks while I have a vocal track going

02:17:06.340 --> 02:17:10.700
but it's like extremely extremely hard to do and that was like the best I can

02:17:10.700 --> 02:17:15.260
it after a couple hours today. I do have a piece of advice in general though. You know

02:17:15.260 --> 02:17:20.480
those drum beats that get louder as they go? You use those quite a lot. Yes, I recognize

02:17:20.480 --> 02:17:26.620
that too in this song. You use that in every single mix! It's just temporary stuff. Alright.

02:17:26.620 --> 02:17:31.300
You know what though? It's a start to something absolutely brilliant. I think that a simple

02:17:31.300 --> 02:17:36.300
crescendo would be good. These people should be contacting you to remix their stuff. 7.5.

02:17:36.300 --> 02:17:46.140
It reminded me a lot of the extended mix that is on Amazon.com that when people first heard

02:17:46.140 --> 02:17:50.300
about Skuld they were downloading and thinking it was going to be in the game.

02:17:50.300 --> 02:17:56.300
Not overly fond of that one, but it was still decent nonetheless, 7.

02:17:56.300 --> 02:18:00.860
Alright let's recap kids, it's not up to us, it's up to you, here are the three songs you

02:18:00.860 --> 02:18:05.520
get to vote for tonight in tonight's cage match.

02:18:05.520 --> 02:18:18.580
Song number one you can vote for tonight is Dare.

02:18:18.580 --> 02:18:35.400
And song number two you can vote for tonight is Kelly Osbourne with One Word.

02:18:35.400 --> 02:18:40.480
Alright, and song number three you can vote for tonight is Echo Image, uh, remixed by

02:18:40.480 --> 02:18:43.480
Loki, Skulk, the Nobody Understands mix.

02:18:55.480 --> 02:19:02.480
Alright, place votes now! Send a private message to Skye in the chat room with your vote for

02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:07.060
song number one, song number two, or song number three. Or you can call them by the

02:19:07.060 --> 02:19:10.820
artist or name. I'm not retarded. I'll be able to figure it out either way.

02:19:10.820 --> 02:19:13.120
We should play my other song since it's on the CD.

02:19:13.120 --> 02:19:17.440
We will get to that. However, I want to give you a chance to talk about what's going on

02:19:17.440 --> 02:19:18.440
in these systems.

02:19:18.440 --> 02:19:24.000
In this scene. Nothing. And sadly enough, you know, I wish I had something to talk about,

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:27.280
but there is nothing. So instead, I'm going to talk about something else, and that's diverse

02:19:27.280 --> 02:19:32.200
systems, D9s coming out. I still haven't figured out a way to actually be able to order the

02:19:32.200 --> 02:19:36.340
rest of them, since their English page only goes up to D6, which I have everything from

02:19:36.340 --> 02:19:44.600
that back. So, I'm gonna maybe try, because I hate experimenting with sending them money,

02:19:44.600 --> 02:19:49.380
especially since there's that language barrier there. I'm gonna try to order something that's

02:19:49.380 --> 02:19:56.060
not on their order page, that's on the Japanese order page, and see if they said it anyways.

02:19:56.060 --> 02:19:59.440
And hopefully they do. If that's the case, because there's a lot of CDs I gotta catch

02:19:59.440 --> 02:20:04.440
up on the whole D7, D8, and then since D9 was announced, and then there's, you know,

02:20:04.440 --> 02:20:14.440
Hello, was it, Hello Mr., was it Desire, and Hello Mr. Taka, I think, or something like

02:20:14.440 --> 02:20:19.440
that. So, those we still need to get, but they've announced the stuff for D9 already,

02:20:19.440 --> 02:20:25.440
and there's a lot of remixes from 9th and 10th style in it so far, so it should be interesting.

02:20:25.440 --> 02:20:27.840
Alright, so that's pretty much it for The Sim Scene?

02:20:27.840 --> 02:20:34.840
Yeah, there's nothing going on. I checked all the FoodMix stuff. No new releases or anything yet.

02:20:34.840 --> 02:20:39.840
Probably you'll see the actual FoodMix release in about a month or so from now.

02:20:39.840 --> 02:20:44.840
It'll be coming. It's coming soon. But stuff like that is worth the wait.

02:20:47.840 --> 02:20:53.840
Too bad none of our listeners were listening to Diversion. Or else we could keep playing this stuff.

02:20:53.840 --> 02:20:58.120
You know, I will still also give it credit here on orange launch radio live, so we'll do it

02:20:58.720 --> 02:21:04.400
Anyway, what we're going to do. We are going to play the other Loki remix while you guys send in your votes right now for cage

02:21:04.400 --> 02:21:05.560
match and

02:21:05.560 --> 02:21:12.040
Then when we come back Dark Sakura has something completely different for you guys in a in a new segment

02:21:12.040 --> 02:21:14.840
I don't know what we can call this segment, but Dark Sakura is gonna the

02:21:15.360 --> 02:21:21.720
WTF news the WTF report brought to you by Dark Sakura, so she'll be giving you that when we come back from this

02:21:21.720 --> 02:21:24.720
Loki, you want to give this one an introduction?

02:21:24.720 --> 02:21:33.720
Yeah, this is a B-side, basically. It's a remix that I did. I finished it just because it didn't turn out as good as I thought it was going to be.

02:21:33.720 --> 02:21:38.720
So, this is a B-side remix of Dropout. I don't really have a title for it. It's just kind of interesting.

02:21:38.720 --> 02:21:44.720
The problem with it is, for one, I couldn't do much with Dropout and the song.

02:21:44.720 --> 02:21:51.700
And when I slowed the first song down to be about dropout speed, it didn't sound right.

02:21:51.700 --> 02:21:57.500
So you can listen to it, it's okay, but it's never going to be on the internet to download.

02:21:57.500 --> 02:22:00.420
So this is the dropout B-side mix, I guess.

02:22:00.420 --> 02:22:01.420
I guess.

02:22:01.420 --> 02:22:05.840
Because it's about, it's like, you know, like how we did, what was it, Acid, that one time.

02:22:05.840 --> 02:22:07.620
It was an okay remix.

02:22:07.620 --> 02:22:11.140
It's not anything I'd be proud of or like be out there, you know, saying, hey, look

02:22:11.140 --> 02:22:12.140
at what I did.

02:22:12.140 --> 02:22:16.980
This is just like, kind of, okay, I did it, you know, I started it, I finished it just

02:22:16.980 --> 02:22:18.900
to get it done, so then, you know, moving on.

02:22:18.900 --> 02:22:20.180
Is this on the MySpace?

02:22:20.180 --> 02:22:21.180
No.

02:22:21.180 --> 02:22:22.180
Okay.

02:22:22.180 --> 02:22:24.420
Plug your MySpace, though, for folks that are into this, if they like your Echo Image

02:22:24.420 --> 02:22:25.420
Mix and they like this.

02:22:25.420 --> 02:22:31.180
If they like the Echo Image Mix, when it's done, finally, it will be on my MySpace page,

02:22:31.180 --> 02:22:37.220
which is MySpace.com slash Loki Fusion, all one word, and you can check it out, you can

02:22:37.220 --> 02:22:38.220
rate MySpace.

02:22:38.220 --> 02:22:39.220
How many friends do you have now?

02:22:39.220 --> 02:22:40.380
I have about 17 friends.

02:22:40.380 --> 02:22:41.380
Woohoo!

02:22:41.380 --> 02:22:47.100
people that I've, they're just random people. Good. So that's kind of neat. But yeah, Myspace.com

02:22:47.100 --> 02:22:52.340
slash LowkeyFusion. You can check it out. I made a little cool banner for it and then,

02:22:52.340 --> 02:22:56.120
and my page doesn't look too bad. So it's pretty nice. Check it out. Right now we've

02:22:56.120 --> 02:23:03.720
got the Ecstasy remix because it's one, that's my favorite. We've got the Battle Without

02:23:03.720 --> 02:23:10.880
Honor or Humanity, the 88 Severed Limbs mix which is on there. We also have, which some

02:23:10.880 --> 02:23:16.640
Some people were saying they couldn't find before, the Radical Faith Final Judgment mix,

02:23:16.640 --> 02:23:18.160
I think is what I called it.

02:23:18.160 --> 02:23:19.160
And that's on there as well.

02:23:19.160 --> 02:23:20.160
Alright, so check it out.

02:23:20.160 --> 02:23:21.160
Here it is.

02:23:21.160 --> 02:23:23.760
The premiere of Dropout, probably the only time you'll hear this.

02:23:23.760 --> 02:23:25.240
Yeah, this is the B-side of it.

02:23:25.240 --> 02:23:26.960
Dropout, the B-side mix, by Loki.

02:23:26.960 --> 02:23:27.960
Enjoy.

02:23:27.960 --> 02:23:29.960
Bring it back!

02:23:29.960 --> 02:23:31.960
I'm a thief!

02:23:31.960 --> 02:23:33.960
I'm telling the truth!

02:23:33.960 --> 02:23:35.960
I'm a thief!

02:23:35.960 --> 02:23:37.960
I'm a thief!

02:23:37.960 --> 02:23:39.960
We have controlled the factory.

02:23:39.960 --> 02:23:41.960
We have controlled the factory.

02:23:41.960 --> 02:23:47.600
Ready but they can't, ready but they can't, ready but they can't

02:23:47.660 --> 02:23:52.220
Ready but they can't, ready but they can't, ready but they can't

02:23:52.380 --> 02:23:55.920
Ready but they can't, ready but they can't

02:23:56.020 --> 02:24:00.660
Ready but they can't, ready but they can't, ready but they can't

02:24:00.980 --> 02:24:05.780
Ready but they can't, ready but they can't, ready but they can't

02:24:05.780 --> 02:24:09.780
I can't believe it, I can't believe it, I can't believe it

02:25:05.780 --> 02:25:15.780
Why I'm not going to put that up on the internet.

02:25:15.780 --> 02:25:16.780
Yes, Loki?

02:25:16.780 --> 02:25:19.340
I said you can see why I'm not going to put that up on the internet.

02:25:19.340 --> 02:25:21.420
Some of the folks in the chat room kind of dug that one.

02:25:21.420 --> 02:25:22.420
Uh huh.

02:25:22.420 --> 02:25:23.420
It's okay.

02:25:23.420 --> 02:25:25.980
It's just, it's nothing I'd be proud of, so.

02:25:25.980 --> 02:25:26.980
Alright.

02:25:26.980 --> 02:25:27.980
Whatever.

02:25:27.980 --> 02:25:34.300
Alright, uh, Dark Sakura, while I tally up the cage moats, make cage moats, cage match

02:25:34.300 --> 02:25:35.300
moats over here.

02:25:35.300 --> 02:25:41.820
Kage Mooch. Yes, love that Kage Mooch. She is going to bring you the WTF report, where,

02:25:41.820 --> 02:25:46.340
you know, it's just a story that you could only find somewhere out there on the internet.

02:25:46.340 --> 02:25:50.340
So, Dark Sakura, what do you have to share with us in the WTF report?

02:25:50.340 --> 02:25:59.340
There's an article, actually I found this on DDR Freak, but it was on Yahoo News about

02:25:59.340 --> 02:26:07.420
international robotics show that they do in Japan. It's at the Aichi World Expo in

02:26:07.420 --> 02:26:15.220
Nakagure. Anyway, they had their a humanoid robot with a skin-like substance,

02:26:15.220 --> 02:26:21.420
a working mouth full torso, it moves as though it's breathing, it sits as and

02:26:21.420 --> 02:26:28.860
acts as a tour guide. But apparently the robot was so realistic looking that

02:26:28.860 --> 02:26:33.860
They were pretty much afraid of it, you know, what does this represent for the future?

02:26:33.860 --> 02:26:39.860
So I'm going to post a link to a, there's actually a good slideshow from the whole thing,

02:26:39.860 --> 02:26:40.860
so I'm going to post this picture.

02:26:40.860 --> 02:26:42.860
And you should look through the slideshow.

02:26:42.860 --> 02:26:44.860
They have ballroom dancing robots.

02:26:44.860 --> 02:26:47.860
They have robots that will do your kitchen deeds for you.

02:26:47.860 --> 02:26:52.860
They show pictures of the bomb squad robots, which I've actually, they have employed in Israel already.

02:26:52.860 --> 02:26:58.860
The question that everybody wants to know, though, was she a pleasure model?

02:26:58.860 --> 02:27:01.860
You know what?

02:27:01.860 --> 02:27:03.860
Shut up.

02:27:03.860 --> 02:27:07.860
I've actually seen this. This was on M-Gadget earlier this week. It was pretty cool.

02:27:07.860 --> 02:27:16.860
The whole thing about the robots, too. They had a captioning contest for the picture with the two ballroom dancing robots, and that was funny.

02:27:16.860 --> 02:27:20.740
What are these strange looking gloves the robot has on her hands?

02:27:20.740 --> 02:27:22.300
Maybe it's to prevent those types of things.

02:27:22.300 --> 02:27:23.820
I don't know.

02:27:23.820 --> 02:27:25.340
Maybe her hands are just not finished yet.

02:27:25.340 --> 02:27:28.540
But you know, the thing is that I saw this when I was thinking about the movie that I

02:27:28.540 --> 02:27:29.540
saw last night.

02:27:29.540 --> 02:27:31.580
High robot or what?

02:27:31.580 --> 02:27:32.580
No.

02:27:32.580 --> 02:27:36.500
I went to go see, well I don't want to spoil it because it's going to be on sci-fi in a

02:27:36.500 --> 02:27:46.700
couple months, but I went to see Bruce Campbell showing his new movie doing like a 40 theater

02:27:46.700 --> 02:27:52.240
tour in the United States of a film he did in Bulgaria called The Man with the Screaming

02:27:52.240 --> 02:27:57.820
Brain based on the Dark Horse comics. But the thing is that it's hard for me to say

02:27:57.820 --> 02:28:03.800
this because there is an android moment in the movie, and the robot just made me flashback

02:28:03.800 --> 02:28:06.260
since I saw it last night. You know what that robot reminds me of, and

02:28:06.260 --> 02:28:10.980
it's completely not having to do with robots at all? It reminds me of this really crappy

02:28:10.980 --> 02:28:20.260
Japanese show called Hey Mikey where it's all with mannequins not you know

02:28:20.260 --> 02:28:24.480
like the little you know puppets or whatever we're talking full-size

02:28:24.480 --> 02:28:29.840
mannequins it was creepy as hell I gotta buy that DVD because that was kind of

02:28:29.840 --> 02:28:33.620
like today's special I hate to bring up the Nickelodeon thing too special but

02:28:33.620 --> 02:28:36.380
today's special was the mannequins were coming to life I remember the 80s movie

02:28:36.380 --> 02:28:43.400
mannequin yeah so I think it mannequin too is bad mannequin too was the first

02:28:43.400 --> 02:28:47.360
one was actually kind of good stay away all right what's this face in it with

02:28:47.360 --> 02:28:52.120
the hair so you really in ten years one of us could be replaced with a robot I'm

02:28:52.120 --> 02:28:55.520
I if it is whether because that robot is very realistic looking that's kind of

02:28:55.520 --> 02:29:01.700
scary their robots could walk among us it's like science fiction maybe one day

02:29:01.700 --> 02:29:07.200
can replace my wife with a robot. How do you know they don't already? How do you know they

02:29:07.200 --> 02:29:13.660
don't already? How do you know they don't already? Bad joke. Yeah, the ferret lives

02:29:13.660 --> 02:29:16.860
among them. Here's how I know they don't already, because there's too many retarded people out

02:29:16.860 --> 02:29:22.960
there, so. Honestly. Bad programming. They haven't got it right yet. Maybe the robots

02:29:22.960 --> 02:29:28.660
are meant to do that. I have to program to make-live my sister. No, no, no, no. There's

02:29:28.660 --> 02:29:32.860
There's a difference between being a full on physical robot and just being a walking

02:29:32.860 --> 02:29:33.860
automaton.

02:29:33.860 --> 02:29:37.740
You know if they cloned a sheep first, maybe they will make a robot of the pleasure sheep

02:29:37.740 --> 02:29:38.740
first.

02:29:38.740 --> 02:29:40.980
You know what?

02:29:40.980 --> 02:29:45.100
Would having sex with a pleasure sheep be just as shameful as sex with a real sheep?

02:29:45.100 --> 02:29:46.340
I think more so.

02:29:46.340 --> 02:29:47.660
I love animals.

02:29:47.660 --> 02:29:51.220
But it's not a real sheep.

02:29:51.220 --> 02:29:53.220
Mikotov, you love sheep.

02:29:53.220 --> 02:29:56.300
Do you love animals?

02:29:56.300 --> 02:30:00.300
or one of my three phobias. It's really sad.

02:30:00.300 --> 02:30:03.300
Oh, what are the other two? Flying bugs and water.

02:30:03.300 --> 02:30:08.300
That's four then. Flying bugs, water, and sheep.

02:30:08.300 --> 02:30:12.300
That's three. Flying bugs, water, and sheep. No, flying bugs.

02:30:12.300 --> 02:30:16.300
Oh, like those huge Brazilian cockroaches.

02:30:16.300 --> 02:30:20.300
You don't want to go to Alabama, though, because my mama got chased down the hall by a flying Brazilian

02:30:20.300 --> 02:30:24.300
cockroach. It was really nasty. Yeah, what happens, though, if you find

02:30:24.300 --> 02:30:28.900
flying sheep that's insect-like and it happens to be sitting in a pond. I mean, that's just

02:30:28.900 --> 02:30:35.940
got to be your worst nightmare right there. Sheep are tasty, that's all I got to say.

02:30:35.940 --> 02:30:41.660
Man, lamb burgers, mmm, yummy. Wait a minute, one of your fears is water, Miklazov? He's

02:30:41.660 --> 02:30:44.860
saying yes. Then I have to ask, how do I microfest? I have to ask, what do you think of Ultramix

02:30:44.860 --> 02:30:45.860
Ultramix 3's theme then.

02:30:45.860 --> 02:30:46.860
Ha ha ha!

02:30:46.860 --> 02:30:47.860
Bubbles.

02:30:47.860 --> 02:30:48.860
Stupid.

02:30:48.860 --> 02:30:49.860
Alright.

02:30:49.860 --> 02:30:57.540
Ultramix 4, the theme is going to be shiny lights to pick up the mentally challenged

02:30:57.540 --> 02:30:58.540
audience.

02:30:58.540 --> 02:31:02.460
Because Ultramix 2, did it really have a theme?

02:31:02.460 --> 02:31:03.460
It was kind of...

02:31:03.460 --> 02:31:04.460
Blue.

02:31:04.460 --> 02:31:05.460
Blue was the theme.

02:31:05.460 --> 02:31:06.460
Oh, I'm sure that made you happy.

02:31:06.460 --> 02:31:07.460
Now we've got Bubbles.

02:31:07.460 --> 02:31:08.460
The theme is Dance Game.

02:31:08.460 --> 02:31:09.460
This will be Ultramix's theme.

02:31:09.460 --> 02:31:19.020
it'll be bubbles and then glitter and then ecstasy. I wonder how many of those Ultramix

02:31:19.020 --> 02:31:23.340
games they'll crank out, man. It'll be crazy. Alright, anyway, let's talk about tonight's

02:31:23.340 --> 02:31:30.900
cage match winner, boys and girls. The winner of tonight's cage match, it was no small vote

02:31:30.900 --> 02:31:35.740
tonight, kids. You guys pretty much voted this one in somewhat of a landslide tonight.

02:31:35.740 --> 02:31:39.740
It was song number... three.

02:31:39.740 --> 02:31:42.740
Moki remixing Echo Image.

02:31:42.740 --> 02:31:43.740
Scope.

02:31:43.740 --> 02:31:46.460
How does this win?

02:31:46.460 --> 02:31:50.700
Because our chat room has a huge boner for Echo Image and they have a huge boner for

02:31:50.700 --> 02:31:54.900
you, so when you put two and two together, they can't contain it at their erection anymore

02:31:54.900 --> 02:31:56.260
and it just comes all over.

02:31:56.260 --> 02:31:59.460
I wish that it would have lost so that I could put the good one in later.

02:31:59.460 --> 02:32:00.460
Oh well.

02:32:00.460 --> 02:32:03.380
You know what's funny is I've actually, I was gonna be bringing a different song for

02:32:03.380 --> 02:32:09.760
cage match, but I forgot my stupid, you know, the flash drive that I have. And what's funny

02:32:09.760 --> 02:32:14.480
is I've tried to bring that song two times, and both times I've forgotten or like something's

02:32:14.480 --> 02:32:18.360
happened where it couldn't be rotten. So I'm wondering if I should never submit that song

02:32:18.360 --> 02:32:23.800
in the cage match ever. Maybe it's a sign. I don't know. Dark Sakura is showing us. Oh,

02:32:23.800 --> 02:32:32.420
that, yeah. The robot up close. Oh, it's scary. Scary stuff. All right. Let's see. Dark Knight

02:32:32.420 --> 02:32:36.560
in the chatroom is asking, has Loki's remixes ever took a loss? And I do recall that you

02:32:36.560 --> 02:32:41.480
did lose at least once. Oh yeah, a couple times. Yeah. I don't know what it was though.

02:32:41.480 --> 02:32:46.580
I am not a very good Orange Lounge radio historian. DDR Angel, who hasn't been here for a couple

02:32:46.580 --> 02:32:50.120
weeks, I hope she's alright. I'm starting to worry now, I'm going to call the police

02:32:50.120 --> 02:32:55.120
if she doesn't come next week. But she's a very good historian of the show, so when I

02:32:55.120 --> 02:33:00.680
have questions I can ask her. The last one I think was, the lose was Legend of the Tran

02:33:00.680 --> 02:33:02.680
2005 maybe I

02:33:03.680 --> 02:33:07.900
Think that one did lose I do remember that so I didn't really want to enter that one

02:33:07.900 --> 02:33:12.240
Anyway, so it's one of those weeks. I still didn't have anything to submit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right

02:33:13.420 --> 02:33:18.500
Let's go to a break in this break. We're gonna do just some potpourri

02:33:18.500 --> 02:33:24.440
We're gonna do whatever bovani songs we feel like when we come back from this break the F use of the week

02:33:25.180 --> 02:33:28.460
So we'll be back after this. We're gonna start off this break with some

02:33:28.460 --> 02:33:33.500
Akumajo Dracula Medley from Keyboard Mania. We'll be back after this with the FUs of the

02:33:33.500 --> 02:33:36.500
If you want to start sending those in right now, you can. We'll be back after this.

02:35:03.500 --> 02:35:26.860
When I began to get so anomaly I still needed to join in

02:35:26.860 --> 02:35:32.000
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
We can do whatever we want.

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
We can do whatever we want.

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:57.000
Feel the heat of vibrations on the streets, no situations.

02:35:57.000 --> 02:36:00.000
Don't create complications, a lot of people live in life.

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:03.000
But it's all they did in the fast lane, light the yellow, you can't have the dust lane

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:06.000
I've seen so many blood stains, so many tiles with these rings

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:09.000
To find people, see what's high, I'm saving up like the sky

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:12.000
Keep it real, I'm raking lies, that I find the people at five

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
This is your life, no keep getting blissable

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:17.000
That's me with the pain, the puppet fist, yeah!

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:21.000
I see you how I feel in this, I'm not so far away from this

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:27.000
Take another dream in this damn thing, Take another chance, don't forget

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:31.000
It's time to say goodbye to that thing

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:36.000
I want you to know, I'm so sorry for you

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:41.000
I want you to know, I'm so sorry for you

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000
I want you alone

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:46.000
I'm ready, you don't need anything

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:49.000
No, it's my time, I need to say

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:52.000
That it's the same for you

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:55.000
You don't need nobody, you can't be me

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:58.000
No, it's the same for you

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:02.000
I can't say it's over, I don't need anyone

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
Oh

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:36.000
Come on, let's play, play it!

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000
Let's play it!

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:51.000
Gaming Radio, so uncensored

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:52.000
Ooh!

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:55.000
That even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
Uh, Mooch, uh, Moochawkie.

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:03.000
He should be a foreign correspondent for us. That'd be awesome.

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:06.000
That'd be pretty awesome. I feel naked tonight.

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:09.000
I have all my clothes on. Don't worry. We didn't turn off the webcam because of that.

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000
We turned off the webcam because the webcam was crappy.

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
Because the room's really dark.

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:16.000
The room's too dark and the webcam's not that good.

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:19.000
So when we get a better webcam, we will bring that back. We promise.

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:24.000
We might even get one of those freaky remote-controlled ones where you could control it during the show.

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000
I'll hide over here.

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:29.660
the cam next to you so that they can't... I can hold the cam? Yeah, you can hold it

02:40:29.660 --> 02:40:32.380
so that they can't turn it around to you. I should have like a camcorder. You can get

02:40:32.380 --> 02:40:36.300
one of those ones like that you hang on your head. I'll do that crappy MTV style upside

02:40:36.300 --> 02:40:41.620
down and shit. Yeah, there you go. There you go. Um, alright, so what we're gonna do now

02:40:41.620 --> 02:40:45.500
is uh, we're gonna get into the, oh, the reason why I feel naked, hello, the reason why I

02:40:45.500 --> 02:40:50.500
feel naked is because I don't have headphones this week. Um, I broke them last week and

02:40:50.500 --> 02:40:53.660
I have yet to go get new ones, I keep forgetting. Like I remember it was probably the day that

02:40:53.660 --> 02:40:58.660
I needed new razors, I forgot to get headphones, because I'm a dumbass.

02:40:58.660 --> 02:40:59.660
I feel naked.

02:40:59.660 --> 02:41:00.660
The parrot still loves you.

02:41:00.660 --> 02:41:04.020
I can't hear myself in my ears, and therefore my ego is saddened.

02:41:04.020 --> 02:41:08.020
And I forgot to mention earlier that Coach Carter came to my work.

02:41:08.020 --> 02:41:09.020
Who cares?

02:41:09.020 --> 02:41:10.220
No, no one cares.

02:41:10.220 --> 02:41:13.380
But it was cool because he was awesome.

02:41:13.380 --> 02:41:14.380
That's good to know.

02:41:14.380 --> 02:41:15.380
He was a good speaker.

02:41:15.380 --> 02:41:16.980
What was the analogy you said earlier while we were...

02:41:16.980 --> 02:41:23.180
He was saying his, well when he introduced his speech by saying it's going to be like

02:41:23.180 --> 02:41:28.180
a woman's dress, long enough to cover the basics, but short enough to keep your attention.

02:41:28.180 --> 02:41:34.300
Okay, it was cool all the time, I'm just kidding, no it's actually kind of funny.

02:41:34.300 --> 02:41:39.420
Alright, let's get into the FUs of the week, FU people.

02:41:39.420 --> 02:41:42.980
Jamie, why is it that we have to do the FUs of the week every single week?

02:41:42.980 --> 02:41:43.980
Grr.

02:41:43.980 --> 02:41:44.980
Argh.

02:41:44.980 --> 02:41:57.140
The motherfucker who keyed my car.

02:41:57.140 --> 02:42:00.940
I hope you have a plague of gnats inside your testicles.

02:42:00.940 --> 02:42:07.780
Also, you know I'm really not too angsty because I love my car.

02:42:07.780 --> 02:42:10.380
My car fills me full of joy.

02:42:10.380 --> 02:42:17.160
But you know, for you people who think, oh I'm going to pass the lancer, fuck you, okay?

02:42:17.160 --> 02:42:18.300
Fuck you.

02:42:18.300 --> 02:42:26.100
My car kicks your ass, except for that special edition Corvette that passed me yesterday.

02:42:26.100 --> 02:42:33.080
And F you to Krispy Kreme, because yesterday I had my cheat day, and I ate three donuts,

02:42:33.080 --> 02:42:40.360
and they were damn good, but I got sick, because sugar makes my stomach hurt a lot.

02:42:40.360 --> 02:42:45.720
like being curled up in a ball of fetal crying tears down my face having to go to hospital

02:42:45.720 --> 02:42:47.000
type hurt.

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.840
And so where I wasn't quite that bad yesterday, it did hurt pretty bad.

02:42:49.840 --> 02:42:56.360
Also, F.U. to not hearing anything back about money for my injury, so I might have to seek

02:42:56.360 --> 02:43:03.880
an accident attorney so that they'll pay me for the ongoing weakness in my right hip from

02:43:03.880 --> 02:43:05.880
my accident.

02:43:05.880 --> 02:43:12.880
The F.U. to moving, where I'm glad to be getting out of my crap-hole apartment complex.

02:43:12.880 --> 02:43:16.880
It's the whole packing all of my stuff up that sucks.

02:43:16.880 --> 02:43:18.880
It makes me a little depressed, too.

02:43:18.880 --> 02:43:24.880
But, overall, I think the biggest F.U. for moving is the dust.

02:43:24.880 --> 02:43:27.880
I'm gonna lay down the law in the new house.

02:43:27.880 --> 02:43:30.880
The house will be regularly dusted.

02:43:30.880 --> 02:43:32.880
And that's all.

02:43:32.880 --> 02:43:38.880
Let's move on to Loki, if I can here.

02:44:02.880 --> 02:44:10.840
game if you keep you know DNS crashing on me so oh well I guess short doses for

02:44:10.840 --> 02:44:21.080
Final Fantasy and then finally fuck you to round table for your smokehouse combo

02:44:21.080 --> 02:44:26.120
pizza because it was actually pretty tasty but it has barbecue sauce on it so

02:44:26.120 --> 02:44:31.320
that just doesn't fit I don't know oh and fuck you to my apartment because the

02:44:31.320 --> 02:44:37.320
So, for some reason, it smokes uncontrollably, and I don't know why. We have to figure that out, and that's without anything in it.

02:44:40.320 --> 02:44:43.320
That's pretty much all that I have to deal with right now.

02:44:46.320 --> 02:44:48.320
Alright, I'm done. Alright, then my turn.

02:44:48.320 --> 02:44:55.320
I want to give an F.U. to this show that they have on MTV. First of all, I want to give

02:44:57.880 --> 02:45:00.800
an F.U. to the fact that I was even watching MTV at all, but I was really bored. But I

02:45:00.800 --> 02:45:05.400
want to give an F.U. to this show on MTV called Next, because it's the biggest piece of trash

02:45:05.400 --> 02:45:10.800
I've ever seen in my life. It's so obviously scripted. Like, this is why people hate reality

02:45:10.800 --> 02:45:15.120
TV is because of a show like this. And what I really hate is I really hate its portrayal

02:45:15.120 --> 02:45:27.120
I've got a couple of gay guys, because it makes them look all like whores, because when they're like ready to speed date or whatever, the guys who are waiting to speed date are all too busy on the bus making out with each other, and I'm like, you're all a bunch of whores.

02:45:27.120 --> 02:45:39.120
But to be on TV dating like strangers that you know nothing about is kind of whorish anyway. At least they're giving away money so I can kind of sympathize with them a little bit, because I do crazy shit for money as well.

02:45:39.120 --> 02:45:43.760
Well, but f you to MTV for having crappy shows like next.

02:45:43.760 --> 02:45:45.760
So that's it.

02:45:45.760 --> 02:45:47.340
I think that's my only FU of the week this week.

02:45:47.340 --> 02:45:48.600
I've actually had a pretty decent week.

02:45:48.600 --> 02:45:49.600
I can't complain.

02:45:49.600 --> 02:45:55.280
All right, Mikotov, what do you have for us tonight?

02:45:55.280 --> 02:45:57.960
Oh yay, Lion Suki.

02:45:57.960 --> 02:46:05.320
I have an FU to NDAs, because oh my god, seriously guys, NDAs suck.

02:46:05.320 --> 02:46:10.720
FU to, that sounded like a good oh my god felt like, oh my god, I want to tell you something

02:46:10.720 --> 02:46:20.720
but I can't, NDA, FU to the crappy EB employee today, now I have love for EB since that's

02:46:20.720 --> 02:46:28.500
where I came from, but EB guy today was just complete jerk and rude, and the GameStop guy

02:46:28.500 --> 02:46:31.340
it was just a little better so

02:46:31.340 --> 02:46:33.020
as you do

02:46:33.020 --> 02:46:34.100
if you don't like

02:46:34.100 --> 02:46:38.100
or it's crappy game but i can't stop playing it

02:46:38.100 --> 02:46:39.040
because

02:46:39.040 --> 02:46:41.540
it was free

02:46:41.540 --> 02:46:44.380
if you have to go to work

02:46:44.380 --> 02:46:51.380
if you've been drunk but i think is that was painful as funny as it is

02:46:52.020 --> 02:46:53.580
it was cool

02:46:53.580 --> 02:46:55.480
when i was in pain

02:46:55.480 --> 02:47:01.480
Because that drinking game we played, King's Cup, was funnier than anything, until I had to drink a lot during it.

02:47:01.480 --> 02:47:03.480
But, yeah.

02:47:03.480 --> 02:47:07.480
Ef-what the hell? Who?

02:47:07.480 --> 02:47:10.480
N-n-that was just a random thing. I'll tell you later.

02:47:10.480 --> 02:47:11.480
Okay.

02:47:11.480 --> 02:47:12.480
No, it's Ef-3.

02:47:12.480 --> 02:47:13.480
Ef-3 did not know what that is!

02:47:13.480 --> 02:47:16.480
Ef-3, the guy with the really long hair who was up there playing DVR.

02:47:16.480 --> 02:47:17.480
Oh god!

02:47:17.480 --> 02:47:19.480
This is one of his cosplays. I'll put it in the chatroom.

02:47:19.480 --> 02:47:21.480
He's at Sunnyville, all the time.

02:47:21.480 --> 02:47:22.480
Yeah.

02:47:22.480 --> 02:47:28.480
I've seen him as Kai, and FU to him, ruining Kai from Guilty Gear.

02:47:28.480 --> 02:47:30.480
I'm not fair.

02:47:30.480 --> 02:47:34.480
Alright, let's get to the chatroom after this, shall we? Because our chatroom is especially angsty tonight.

02:47:34.480 --> 02:47:42.480
Um, OMGitsdoobs, although he's under the guise of OMGtitsboobs, but whatever.

02:47:42.480 --> 02:47:47.480
FU to SSJ100Matt and MPQ for being such whores about my new name, suck it up.

02:47:47.480 --> 02:47:49.480
Oh, I was just going to worry about your name too, sorry.

02:47:49.480 --> 02:47:50.480
Hey, I came up with that name!

02:47:50.480 --> 02:47:54.480
FU to Orlando for being so damn shitty. It's just a waste of 14 hours of my life.

02:47:54.480 --> 02:47:56.480
FU to Wangan, I'm sorry.

02:47:56.480 --> 02:47:59.480
Wangan, I can't pronounce this word for the life of me.

02:47:59.480 --> 02:48:02.480
Wangan, Wangan, Wangan, Wangan?

02:48:02.480 --> 02:48:05.480
I think maybe Wangan? He missed a letter then.

02:48:05.480 --> 02:48:07.480
Wangan Midnight 2.

02:48:07.480 --> 02:48:10.480
Wangan, whatever. That game, the race game.

02:48:10.480 --> 02:48:13.480
Because of it, I don't like Initial D Arcade anymore.

02:48:13.480 --> 02:48:18.480
And FU to Malaysian people and MMOs because their English is just as annoying as the English of Brazilian people.

02:48:18.480 --> 02:48:19.920
That was good and racist.

02:48:19.920 --> 02:48:25.920
He also says, oh and F you to O2 Jam for having such bad songs. I hate it.

02:48:25.920 --> 02:48:29.420
Moving on, Yuki would like to say, F you to work being so dead today.

02:48:29.420 --> 02:48:33.120
Much as the money would help with my credit card payment, I just wanted to be sent home early.

02:48:33.120 --> 02:48:34.380
I know the feeling.

02:48:34.380 --> 02:48:39.480
Start Tetsuya says, F you to AOL and my phone line. I missed half the show because of it.

02:48:39.480 --> 02:48:40.920
America Offline.

02:48:40.920 --> 02:48:47.280
DJ Dark Knight says, let me just flat out say it. F you to gas prices. Oh and an F you to work.

02:48:47.280 --> 02:48:52.820
SSJ 100 Matt says, F you to real life work for keeping me away from this show and games

02:48:52.820 --> 02:48:57.620
in general. F you to emo. F you to the New York Yankees losing. Laugh now, but they will

02:48:57.620 --> 02:49:06.380
be back. MPQ says, F you to myself for forgetting about the show last week. LemonLimeJump says,

02:49:06.380 --> 02:49:12.000
F you to my town. Period. Reznor says, a nice fuck you to people that think Honda Civics

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:18.420
With blink and outrace anything and another fu to anyone that thinks any NES game sucks because of the graphics

02:49:20.880 --> 02:49:26.160
What about bubble bath babes the graphics were kind of shitty in that game and the game could have been a whole lot better

02:49:26.800 --> 02:49:30.840
Revenge a game was too damn hard for boobies. Okay, honestly

02:49:32.080 --> 02:49:33.060
All right

02:49:33.060 --> 02:49:38.000
Illusion says major major major fu to in the groove shipping not an fu to in the groove but an fu to the fact

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:41.560
that I didn't get my copy my friend doesn't order things online so she gave

02:49:41.560 --> 02:49:45.400
me her money to order the game for her so both copies of the game were supposed

02:49:45.400 --> 02:49:49.280
to ship to my house but only her copy shipped to my house on Friday driving me

02:49:49.280 --> 02:49:53.080
mad with anger if you'd only three people going there you get to keep your

02:49:53.080 --> 02:49:58.040
copy and she has to wait for hers that's the way it works buddy all right

02:49:58.040 --> 02:50:02.640
interesting question in the chat room there vid power says did you know that

02:50:02.640 --> 02:50:05.640
Did you know that AOL has a video game radio station?

02:50:05.640 --> 02:50:08.640
Did you know that ours is better?

02:50:08.640 --> 02:50:11.640
Did you know that we don't give a flying flip?

02:50:11.640 --> 02:50:15.640
Did you ever know that you're my hero?

02:50:15.640 --> 02:50:17.640
You're everything I wish I could be.

02:50:17.640 --> 02:50:20.640
Can you fly higher than the eagle?

02:50:20.640 --> 02:50:21.640
I am the wind beneath you.

02:50:21.640 --> 02:50:24.640
Stop it! Stop it right now!

02:50:24.640 --> 02:50:27.640
God.

02:50:27.640 --> 02:50:30.640
Alright.

02:50:30.640 --> 02:50:34.400
something from old-school NES but I'll wait I'll wait for another appropriate

02:50:34.400 --> 02:50:40.680
occasion to do that um let's see what can we do now we could do some ask

02:50:40.680 --> 02:50:45.340
orange lounge we don't have any questions in yet we're yeah we're

02:50:45.340 --> 02:50:48.640
starting to run out of show here we're running out of steam and I don't have no

02:50:48.640 --> 02:50:51.640
post to the week you know we have another news story do you have something

02:50:51.640 --> 02:50:56.760
well I guess we're just gonna talk about other news I know it sucks I have dead

02:50:56.760 --> 02:50:59.760
skin on my feet

02:50:59.760 --> 02:51:00.760
that's

02:51:00.760 --> 02:51:01.760
alert the media

02:51:01.760 --> 02:51:02.760
breaking news folks

02:51:02.760 --> 02:51:06.760
PSP home brew on version 1.5 PSP

02:51:06.760 --> 02:51:10.760
that means all you US people that have been waiting for home brew games

02:51:10.760 --> 02:51:13.760
and all the Japanese people have been rubbing in your face

02:51:13.760 --> 02:51:14.760
it's coming

02:51:14.760 --> 02:51:18.760
it's going to be released supposedly on June 15th

02:51:18.760 --> 02:51:21.760
at 3pm

02:51:21.760 --> 02:51:22.760
general mountain time

02:51:22.760 --> 02:51:24.760
and what's cool about it

02:51:24.760 --> 02:51:47.760
All I know is it's coming out in a couple days and that makes me happy because I'll be able to run, like, crappy stuff for the PSP. I'll be able to put all my, you know, Game Boy Advance games on the PSP. How's that for irony?

02:51:47.760 --> 02:51:54.080
And then so basically yeah, it's gonna be coming out it'll be cool and they've got me working for it right now

02:51:54.080 --> 02:52:01.760
So, you know what? That means I'm gonna try to do. Oh, yeah, that's right. We're gonna be putting on the porno games

02:52:04.600 --> 02:52:10.560
Alright all the gals panic I can possibly handle more to look forward on that on the podcast. Yeah, check out the podcast

02:52:10.560 --> 02:52:15.440
Yes, check it out. I have to do this story. It's something you actually posted the site earlier this week

02:52:15.440 --> 02:52:18.260
this is too damn good I can't believe we haven't brought this up on the show

02:52:18.260 --> 02:52:20.960
earlier because we probably could have gone off for about a half-hour on it

02:52:20.960 --> 02:52:25.760
you posted something on Tuesday it has to do with dance dance revolution being

02:52:25.760 --> 02:52:31.240
mixed with fire yes this now Jamie don't get too excited

02:52:31.240 --> 02:52:36.840
this grin on her face got dance dance immolation is the name of the game here

02:52:36.840 --> 02:52:40.680
and you can actually go to this website here and the way this works what is

02:52:40.680 --> 02:52:45.280
Dance Dance Immolation. It's an adaptation, this is from the website

02:52:45.280 --> 02:52:51.000
interpretivearson.com slash DDI, actually is the name of the site here.

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:55.600
Dance Dance Immolation is an adaptation of the popular arcade video game Dance

02:52:55.600 --> 02:53:00.600
Dance Revolution, but with fire. Basically you play DDR. When you do well, the

02:53:00.600 --> 02:53:05.320
computer shoots big propane blasts up in the air. When you do poorly, it shoots you

02:53:05.320 --> 02:53:10.040
in the face with flamethrowers. Yes, you as in your actual body. And yes,

02:53:10.040 --> 02:53:15.080
flamethrowers like the kind that are on fire now before you freak out here this

02:53:15.080 --> 02:53:18.960
is what they say wait isn't this dangerous before you play you'll put on

02:53:18.960 --> 02:53:25.400
a fully aluminized proximity suit with a forced air respirator gloves fireproof

02:53:25.400 --> 02:53:29.240
hood the whole bit these are the suits that are used for fighting fires at

02:53:29.240 --> 02:53:35.120
airports so basically you suit up and you play DDR but if you screw up you get

02:53:35.120 --> 02:53:39.320
shot with fire some more cool some more info on this okay now the website right

02:53:39.320 --> 02:53:44.400
now they just have their testing, their homemade flamethrower that they made.

02:53:44.400 --> 02:53:47.440
So it's not actually gameplay shots or anything like that.

02:53:47.440 --> 02:53:52.240
However, there was another post on the DDR community and LiveJournal, they had some more

02:53:52.240 --> 02:53:53.640
pictures of the same thing.

02:53:53.640 --> 02:53:59.760
But what's going to be happening is they actually have a computer running StepMania with a Firebase

02:53:59.760 --> 02:54:08.600
theme and Firebase songs, like Burning Heat, Burning Up For You, My Fire, stuff like that.

02:54:08.600 --> 02:54:13.600
So it's gonna be Rainstep Mania, if you wanna play this, you gotta be going to Burning Man.

02:54:13.600 --> 02:54:14.600
How appropriate.

02:54:14.600 --> 02:54:17.760
Burning Man, and there's also some Fyre Festival, I guess, in Oberlin or something like that.

02:54:17.760 --> 02:54:23.360
I never got Burning Man, like I understand it's a big thing that all these people go

02:54:23.360 --> 02:54:24.360
to the desert for.

02:54:24.360 --> 02:54:27.840
I don't get it, so to speak.

02:54:27.840 --> 02:54:30.840
I don't know if this is representative of what goes on at Burning Man, but let's just

02:54:30.840 --> 02:54:33.240
say you aren't selling any tickets with this, okay?

02:54:33.240 --> 02:54:38.120
I mean, this is the kind of stuff I would expect to see, like, on Jackass, but, like,

02:54:38.120 --> 02:54:39.480
I don't know, even crazier.

02:54:39.480 --> 02:54:41.680
I'm just waiting for the lawsuits.

02:54:41.680 --> 02:54:42.680
And video.

02:54:42.680 --> 02:54:43.680
I don't think there'll be a lawsuit.

02:54:43.680 --> 02:54:47.080
I mean, these people probably do this with other crap all the time.

02:54:47.080 --> 02:54:51.720
If people are stupid enough to suit up, I'm sure that they have disclaimers out the ass.

02:54:51.720 --> 02:54:55.520
I'm not talking about them suiting up, I'm talking about stupid kids lighting themselves

02:54:55.520 --> 02:54:58.520
on fire.

02:54:58.520 --> 02:55:02.240
Because they see this on TV or something, or they see this in action, they see this

02:55:02.240 --> 02:55:06.140
on the internet? I guess, yeah. Well, maybe parents ought to, you know, take responsibility,

02:55:06.140 --> 02:55:15.820
keep fire away from their kids. Parents just don't understand, you know. So, very interesting.

02:55:15.820 --> 02:55:21.000
If you're interested in fire and DDR, maybe this is the thing for you. Dance Dance, what

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:28.180
was this again? Immolation. Immolation. And of course they have a PayPal link on their

02:55:28.180 --> 02:55:31.980
site because you know you couldn't have this without a PayPal link and the

02:55:31.980 --> 02:55:36.460
festival that they'll be showing us at the crucibles fire arts festival in

02:55:36.460 --> 02:55:41.140
Oakland in July who knew that there was a whole festival about fire Jamie you

02:55:41.140 --> 02:55:46.100
should be going to this I would so you know I'm actually on the website right

02:55:46.100 --> 02:55:51.260
now I would be afraid that like in order to go they would like shoot you with fire

02:55:51.260 --> 02:55:56.300
I know people who've gone oh god that scares me I mean fire is cool and all

02:55:56.300 --> 02:55:58.300
but not when it's on me.

02:56:26.300 --> 02:56:29.820
All right, I think that's gonna do it for tonight's show boys and girls

02:56:29.820 --> 02:56:33.020
Thank you very much for tuning in and listening to orange lounge radio tonight

02:56:33.660 --> 02:56:35.660
We got to wrap it up though

02:56:35.740 --> 02:56:39.260
We got a lot of stuff to do after the show tonight such as tape a podcast

02:56:39.260 --> 02:56:41.340
We know you guys like the podcast if you want to check that out

02:56:41.340 --> 02:56:45.940
Www dot orange house radio comm I'm on the orange lounge radio to go edition. Yes, Jamie

02:56:45.940 --> 02:56:50.900
I'm going to try to scare the shit out of you in my car. Okay, how so I'm going to drive

02:56:50.900 --> 02:57:00.620
All right. Let's go around and get everybody's final thought. Loki, your final thought.

02:57:00.620 --> 02:57:06.620
My final thought is I hope what they're saying about the PSP is true and that I'll be able

02:57:06.620 --> 02:57:12.100
to run homebrew games on Wednesday because I've got, you know, there's not that many

02:57:12.100 --> 02:57:18.700
games out I want to buy and the emulators rock, so go homebrew hoping for StepMania

02:57:18.700 --> 02:57:22.160
imported to the PSP because

02:57:22.160 --> 02:57:23.380
I don't know

02:57:23.380 --> 02:57:27.280
because In the Groove needs a PSP version

02:57:27.280 --> 02:57:30.460
Miele Tov, your final thought

02:57:30.460 --> 02:57:32.200
I like blue alcohol,

02:57:32.200 --> 02:57:36.880
blue DS's, and Russian boys

02:57:36.880 --> 02:57:43.060
uh... my final thought is um...

02:57:43.060 --> 02:57:47.580
I don't have one, I'm sorry, I don't have any... chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, it's blank

02:57:47.580 --> 02:57:50.980
my final thought is reject false icons

02:57:50.980 --> 02:57:55.020
and my car owns you all

02:57:55.020 --> 02:58:00.180

Hey baby, wake up from your sleep.

02:58:35.660 --> 02:58:39.660
We have arrived on to the future and the whole world is become

02:58:42.660 --> 02:58:49.660
Electronic, supersonic, supersonic, electronic

02:58:51.660 --> 02:58:55.660

My blue jeans is tight, so onto my love rocket climb

02:58:59.660 --> 02:59:03.660
Inside tank of fuel is not fuel, but love

02:59:03.660 --> 02:59:07.660
Above us, there is nothing above but the stars above.

02:59:07.660 --> 02:59:10.660
All systems gone, prepare for down count.

02:59:10.660 --> 02:59:15.660
Five, four, three, one, off blast!

02:59:16.660 --> 02:59:19.660
Fly away, my space rocket.

02:59:19.660 --> 02:59:23.660
You no need put money in my pocket.

02:59:23.660 --> 02:59:27.660
The door is closed, I just lock it.

02:59:27.660 --> 02:59:31.660
I put my co-plug in your socket.

02:59:31.660 --> 02:59:34.660
The sun and sky is bright like fire

02:59:34.660 --> 02:59:38.660
You and me gets higher and higher

02:59:38.660 --> 02:59:42.660
Out of communication bias

02:59:42.660 --> 02:59:46.660
Only thing can stop us is flat tire

02:59:49.660 --> 02:59:53.660
Hey love crusader, I want to be your space invader

02:59:53.660 --> 02:59:56.660
For you I would descend the deepest moon crater

02:59:56.660 --> 02:59:59.660
Eyes more stronger than dark vapor

02:59:59.660 --> 03:00:02.660
Obey me, I is your new dictator.

03:00:02.660 --> 03:00:04.660
For you is Venus, I am Mars.

03:00:04.660 --> 03:00:07.660
With you I is more richer than all the stars.

03:00:07.660 --> 03:00:09.660
Make our wishes on our shooting stars.

03:00:09.660 --> 03:00:13.660
Then for you I will play on my cosmic guitar.

03:00:13.660 --> 03:00:17.660
Ladies and gentlemen, fasten your belt, please.

03:00:17.660 --> 03:00:19.660
We have commenced our descent.

03:00:19.660 --> 03:00:23.660
I trust you enjoy this flight as much as you enjoy this accent.

03:00:23.660 --> 03:00:27.660
Now, back on Earth, it's time for down splash.

03:00:27.660 --> 03:00:31.160
Into sea of eternal glory my spaceship crash

03:00:31.160 --> 03:00:34.660
People have arrived for to cheer me from near and far

03:00:34.660 --> 03:00:37.160
And as I float I open door and shout

03:00:37.160 --> 03:00:43.160
I am way's biggest washed up superstar

03:00:43.160 --> 03:00:49.160
As for sure as the sun rises in the west

03:00:49.160 --> 03:00:52.660
Of all the singers and poets on earth I am the bestest

03:00:52.660 --> 03:00:55.660
Come let me put the ring of Jupiter on your finger

03:00:55.660 --> 03:00:58.660
And like a smell around you, I will forever linger

03:00:58.660 --> 03:01:01.660
Okay, it's time for end, no more will I sang

03:01:01.660 --> 03:01:03.660
Let me take you back in time

03:01:03.660 --> 03:01:07.660
I want for you to experience Big Bang

03:01:10.660 --> 03:01:12.660
Long live Space Race

03:01:12.660 --> 03:01:13.660
Long live

03:01:13.660 --> 03:01:43.420
Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.

03:01:43.420 --> 03:01:47.180
Alright guys, I promised that after the show we would play this one more time.

03:01:47.180 --> 03:01:50.060
I'm actually going to play the original version of this, though.

03:01:50.060 --> 03:01:55.060
It's very similar to the DDR one, but it's just a little shorter, a little less instruments,

03:01:55.060 --> 03:01:56.060
but same idea.

03:01:56.060 --> 03:01:58.140
So if you guys didn't get to hear this earlier, you'll still get an idea.

03:01:58.140 --> 03:02:00.400
And those of you that did hear it, it's something a little different.

03:02:00.400 --> 03:02:04.940
So this is the album version of the new song we announced tonight, because actually, Spray

03:02:04.940 --> 03:02:09.500
was the first to announce this on their website, The Artist, I Am Gothic, the original version.

03:02:09.500 --> 03:02:16.500
and enjoy.

03:02:39.500 --> 03:02:45.500
Step inside the candlelight, my very own gloom

03:02:45.500 --> 03:02:49.500
I'm just no crazy, I'm considerate of truth

03:02:49.500 --> 03:02:52.500
In the fog, being dark, can't you feel my pain?

03:02:52.500 --> 03:02:56.500
People are all the same, they isolate my way

03:02:56.500 --> 03:03:03.500
Can't you tell the craziest answer of all?

03:03:03.500 --> 03:03:08.500
I am broken, I am found

03:03:10.500 --> 03:03:13.500
I am nothing, I am dead

03:03:13.500 --> 03:03:17.500
I am scary, I am strange

03:03:17.500 --> 03:03:20.500
I am alone and I am cold

03:03:20.500 --> 03:03:24.500
I see a way to where the people come from

03:03:38.500 --> 03:03:41.500
All the pure and pure, all the pure, yeah

03:03:41.500 --> 03:03:44.500
And it won't come very near, dear

03:03:45.500 --> 03:03:48.500
It's okay, I'm free, I don't like your fans

03:03:48.500 --> 03:03:52.500
I don't put any effort in, it's just how I am

03:03:52.500 --> 03:03:55.500
I'm disturbed, I feel hurt, I'm a chance at sleep

03:03:55.500 --> 03:03:59.500
Write new poetry, you can definitely read

03:03:59.500 --> 03:04:06.500
I'm a missing word, it's not easy to find

03:04:06.500 --> 03:04:13.500
Just a missing word to find

03:04:13.500 --> 03:04:20.600
I am cold, I am pale, I am scary, I am pale

03:04:20.720 --> 03:04:27.760
I'm a lover, I am cold, I see affect when people come close

03:04:27.960 --> 03:04:34.560
I am coverage, I am rare, I am scary, I am pretty

03:04:34.560 --> 03:04:41.560
I'm a loner, I am cold I see a picture where the people don't fall

03:04:41.560 --> 03:05:11.280
I am perfect, I am pale, I am scary, I am sane, I am louder, I am cold, I see what's

03:05:11.280 --> 03:05:21.280
I feel better when people don't fall I am your fake, I am failed, I am scary, I'm insane

03:05:21.280 --> 03:05:24.280
I ain't no lover, I have a call

03:05:24.280 --> 03:05:29.280
I feel better when people don't fall

03:05:54.280 --> 03:06:00.820
Okay, there was the original version of I Am Gothic, so it should be an interesting

03:06:00.820 --> 03:06:04.640
next few weeks as we start to learn some more, or I should say next few months as we start

03:06:04.640 --> 03:06:08.440
to learn more and more of these songs that we will be doing the DDR to.

03:06:08.440 --> 03:06:09.840
Till next time, have a good one.
