Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition week of June 27th, 2005.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.960
dedicated to those video games that don't suck and well sometimes we do have

00:34.960 --> 00:38.420
to talk about some that do but not very many we try to keep that to a minimum my

00:38.420 --> 00:42.520
name is Rob Roberts you might know me as Sky join me as always my awesome co-host

00:42.520 --> 00:47.380
in this quarter the happiest bunny on the farm dark Sakura Jamie Summers you

00:47.380 --> 00:50.820
know the ones that suck are the ones we make fun of of course we have to bring

00:50.820 --> 00:59.080
them up so we can tease bash them into a broken silicon and wires and melted

00:59.080 --> 01:02.800
plastic and then of course you know a reoccurring theme that's come up a lot

01:02.800 --> 01:06.280
lately or the games that are being turned into movies that we get to bash

01:06.280 --> 01:09.340
into a bloody pulp and all that stuff don't get me and I have another one to

01:09.340 --> 01:14.460
talk about tonight joy joy joy also joining us tech massa one and only Loki

01:14.460 --> 01:21.100
I am here how you doing I'm here all right here we are he's there yeah he's

01:21.100 --> 01:24.500
there you're here we're all here this is me in the corner in the in the person

01:24.500 --> 01:25.500
Is that you in the spotlight?

01:25.500 --> 01:26.500
That's me in the spotlight.

01:26.500 --> 01:27.500
Yeah.

01:27.500 --> 01:28.500
Great.

01:28.500 --> 01:33.620
Just a reminder, Horns On Treaty to Go edition is actually brought to you in MP3 Pro encoding.

01:33.620 --> 01:37.460
So if you don't like the way this sounds on your iPod, that's because iPods don't have

01:37.460 --> 01:38.620
the MP3 Pro thing.

01:38.620 --> 01:41.820
I wish they did, but maybe they'll get that in the future.

01:41.820 --> 01:46.040
But if you listen to this on Winamp or whatever, you can get a MP3 Pro codec, and this show

01:46.040 --> 01:47.040
sounds even better.

01:47.040 --> 01:49.220
You can hear us in full stereo and everything.

01:49.220 --> 01:50.220
It's great.

01:50.220 --> 01:51.220
Anyway.

01:51.220 --> 01:53.120
Just thought I'd throw that out there, because I haven't talked about that in like 25 weeks

01:53.120 --> 01:54.120
or so.

01:54.120 --> 01:55.700
I thought I'd bring that up again.

01:55.700 --> 01:57.440
All right, let's get into it.

01:57.440 --> 01:59.060
First off, before we get into the news,

01:59.060 --> 02:00.440
we'll always like to let you guys know

02:00.440 --> 02:02.800
what we've been up to, how our gaming weeks have been,

02:02.800 --> 02:04.080
what we've been playing.

02:04.080 --> 02:06.400
Dark Sakura, I know you've been busy with moving and stuff.

02:06.400 --> 02:08.360
Have you had any time for gaming?

02:08.360 --> 02:13.360
I played one quest on PSO, and that was it.

02:14.000 --> 02:14.840
Busy, busy.

02:14.840 --> 02:17.240
It's amazing what the real life will do to you.

02:17.240 --> 02:18.280
I did the caves.

02:18.280 --> 02:19.440
And how'd that go?

02:19.440 --> 02:21.760
Well, this thing is how I have a full power mag

02:21.760 --> 02:28.400
at the time of the level 11 character. I'm level 13 now. I was just like die, die, die,

02:28.400 --> 02:33.640
die, die, die, die, die, die, die. How's PSO going now that it went pay? Is there a lot

02:33.640 --> 02:37.800
less people on there? I haven't noticed. I always play by myself or with people I know

02:37.800 --> 02:43.240
anyway. It's PSO. Same thing it always was. We're supposed to have ep 4 though. I need

02:43.240 --> 02:47.600
to check that out. I'm looking forward to the Phantasy Star universe too that they were

02:47.600 --> 02:51.040
show on E3. It looked pretty cool. Yeah, that was pretty cool. Alright, so Loki, how was

02:51.040 --> 02:59.160
your gaming week? What'd you play? I picked up Destroy All Humans. You know, remembering

02:59.160 --> 03:05.200
that you also ran out and bought Alien Hamed and you like these invader zimish alien taking

03:05.200 --> 03:08.120
over the world type games, doesn't surprise me one bit that you ran out and bought it.

03:08.120 --> 03:12.400
Well, the only reason I bought Alien Hamed is because it reminded me of Contra and Metal

03:12.400 --> 03:17.360
Slug. That's the only reason I bought that game. But no, Destroy All Humans was basically

03:17.360 --> 03:24.560
for the... it's the same reason I bought Dog's Life. In fact, this game is very... it reminds

03:24.560 --> 03:30.160
me of a dog's life in a lot of aspects. Except for the fact that you're an alien and the

03:30.160 --> 03:34.480
other one you're a dog and this alien has the ability to throw stuff telekinetically

03:34.480 --> 03:39.960
which just offers endless playability right there. You can just pick up chickens, throw

03:39.960 --> 03:44.920
them into walls, pick up people, throw them against the ground, pick up a cow, throw it

03:44.920 --> 03:48.240
into the air. Help me understand this game a little bit, because I've seen the commercials

03:48.240 --> 03:52.200
and everything, so I understand that you play as an alien who is destroying all humans.

03:52.200 --> 03:55.520
Why? Why? Why are they killing all humans? Why are they destroying all humans? Okay.

03:55.520 --> 03:59.680
Well basically what happens is this race of aliens or whatever, they're from some distant

03:59.680 --> 04:05.920
planet and a long, long time ago when they destroyed the Martians or whatever, they got

04:05.920 --> 04:10.360
pissed off or whatever and came to Earth, they found that it was very primitive and

04:10.360 --> 04:16.620
not so they injected some of their DNA into the early humans and since their

04:16.620 --> 04:22.660
race has no ability to reproduce they have to clone themselves and after a

04:22.660 --> 04:28.540
while generations and generations their clones have become inferior to what they

04:28.540 --> 04:32.980
used to be so now they've come back to earth to extract this DNA from humans

04:32.980 --> 04:37.820
and at the same time just destroy the whole planet because you know they're

04:37.820 --> 04:40.840
destruction for no particular that's because that that's what they do that's

04:40.840 --> 04:45.020
why they destroyed the Martians are like Jamie driving in her new car hey you

04:45.020 --> 04:48.400
ran my car with me today and I didn't kill anybody while you were there

04:48.400 --> 04:54.000
although you wanted to stupid van although it is a lot of fun and

04:54.000 --> 04:58.200
basically put you right in the middle of us like a cheesy be sci-fi movie from

04:58.200 --> 05:03.080
like the 50s and it's great just you know so much um playability in there

05:03.080 --> 05:06.520
the commercials gave me the impression that it has that grand theft auto ish

05:06.520 --> 05:11.440
style of, just do whatever the hell you want. If you want to follow the story, do it. Is

05:11.440 --> 05:12.440
that true?

05:12.440 --> 05:18.700
Sort of. Like I said, it's very similar to A Dog's Life 4. You've got the missions that

05:18.700 --> 05:21.500
you're supposed to be doing, but after you finish the mission, you're still in the level

05:21.500 --> 05:29.220
so you can collect what's left of, there's like these hidden, almost like probes or whatever

05:29.220 --> 05:33.320
you have to find, and then that unlocks some other stuff. And then you can also extract

05:33.320 --> 05:38.960
DNA from the people and that you can use to upgrade your ship, upgrade your abilities

05:38.960 --> 05:40.960
and whatnot.

05:40.960 --> 05:46.600
But meantime I just have fun going and destroying all the houses and stuff in your spaceship

05:46.600 --> 05:52.120
and just throwing stuff in the walls and whatnot.

05:52.120 --> 05:53.120
Graphics good?

05:53.120 --> 05:55.480
The graphics are pretty good, they're decent.

05:55.480 --> 06:00.520
I do like throwing chickens in the people and killing people with chickens, that's great.

06:00.520 --> 06:02.080
Would you recommend the game to our listeners?

06:02.080 --> 06:05.260
oh yeah definitely go go play it there's not much in July so

06:05.260 --> 06:08.620
it's a good game. For everybody to play or for a certain audience?

06:08.620 --> 06:12.920
Oh it's for everyone just go honestly just go play it I mean it's a lot of fun even if

06:12.920 --> 06:13.560
you don't buy it

06:13.560 --> 06:18.480
rent it it's great. I'm done.

06:18.480 --> 06:23.000
I got a call actually today from Dan while he was at work asking me if I wanted a

06:23.000 --> 06:24.160
black Labrador

06:24.160 --> 06:28.720
a miniature dachshund or a chihuahua. You're getting a doggy?

06:28.720 --> 06:32.560
I'm getting a Nintendog. Ah, I see. So I went for the Black Lab.

06:32.560 --> 06:36.400
Now, this is because in Japan they have them all separated into the

06:36.400 --> 06:39.680
different packs, right? But they're not doing that here, are they? Yes, they are.

06:39.680 --> 06:43.400
Are they? Three of them. I was never quite clear on whether they were

06:43.400 --> 06:45.840
splitting it up or not, because E3 I didn't get that impression.

06:45.840 --> 06:48.920
They are dope. I'm getting the Black Lab.

06:48.920 --> 06:52.600
Which will make one of our listeners who uses that as an alias very happy.

06:52.600 --> 06:55.440
Exactly. I even posted in my live channel,

06:55.440 --> 07:00.280
Puppy you should dig this. I actually picked the Black Lab because it goes with my little

07:00.280 --> 07:04.640
freebie thing that I got it E3. I'm gonna get a Chihuahua because Chihuahuas

07:04.640 --> 07:06.440
annoy everybody. Actually um

07:06.440 --> 07:11.120
they do have, well if you notice all the um US ones have different dogs than the

07:11.120 --> 07:15.080
Japanese ones. However the um US ones

07:15.080 --> 07:19.380
you can unlock the Japanese dogs and also for example if someone has the

07:19.380 --> 07:21.520
Chihuahua one, someone has the mini dash-hound

07:21.520 --> 07:24.920
and you, you I guess interact with the Chihuahua one

07:24.920 --> 07:28.000
it unlocks the Chihuahua on yours. So we should all make sure we get different ones

07:28.000 --> 07:33.160
when we look at the game. Is there a Shih Tzu? Yes there is a Shih Tzu. I have to get a Shih Tzu

07:33.160 --> 07:35.080
just so I can say I have a Shih Tzu.

07:35.080 --> 07:38.120
It's technically a Shih Tzu. I like Shih Tzu.

07:38.120 --> 07:42.320
Yeah, puh. I almost picked the Dachshund

07:42.320 --> 07:45.640
but I like the Black Labs.

07:45.640 --> 07:50.040
Yeah, I'm still waiting for Nintendo. Labrador Retriever, Chihuahua, and me dash on.

07:50.040 --> 07:53.280
Alright, speaking of DS games, my gaming week, what I got to play this week was

07:53.280 --> 07:54.480
Bomberman DS

07:54.480 --> 07:59.180
Which I am pretty pleased with you know, what can I say? It's Bomberman

07:59.280 --> 08:02.680
There's probably been a version of Bomberman on just about every console

08:02.880 --> 08:09.480
Jamie you're probably more of an expert at this than I am. PC Engine is all about Bomberman 93. I knew it had was on PC Engine

08:09.480 --> 08:12.560
But like was there one on Genesis? I don't know. There was no

08:12.560 --> 08:14.120
I don't think there was a Bomberman on Genesis

08:14.120 --> 08:18.740
But like damn near every console. The best version ever is Super Bomberman 2 on Super Nintendo

08:18.740 --> 08:22.660
I I do remember the old Super Nintendo, there were like four of them on Super Nintendo. We had the

08:22.660 --> 08:30.640
The multi-tap well if you if you're a Bomberman fan, this is pretty much classic Bomberman, but the very cool thing

08:30.640 --> 08:35.840
I love what they did with this Bomberman DS is that you can play a person multiplayer one cartridge

08:36.160 --> 08:38.660
None of this everybody's got to have the cartridge and play the game

08:39.080 --> 08:43.280
Because the DS is wireless and everything and just send the game over and eight people can play off one cartridge

08:43.280 --> 08:46.460
I think that's awesome. And this is what else I love about the DS

08:47.200 --> 08:51.320
Here in this game is that it's not touch at all

08:51.320 --> 08:56.000
it's using the two screen thing I think you can like you can set the controls to

08:56.000 --> 08:59.480
use the touchscreen if you want but I'm loving it now that the games aren't

08:59.480 --> 09:03.560
feeling the need to whore the touch thing incessantly like they're actually

09:03.560 --> 09:06.880
coming up with good games that use just the two screen feature and that's what

09:06.880 --> 09:09.920
Bomberman does because there's eight people now you have eight corners

09:09.920 --> 09:14.880
because there's the two screens so it works out pretty well graphic wise it's

09:14.880 --> 09:17.160
just you know what you expect from a Bomberman game probably you know a

09:17.160 --> 09:20.000
little better than what you saw in Super Nintendo but you know it's it's it's

09:20.000 --> 09:24.820
It's Bomberman, it's not gonna revolutionize the graphic world, and it's just, it's a fun,

09:24.820 --> 09:29.100
it's a very good handheld game, because handheld games are supposed to be the quick and easy,

09:29.100 --> 09:30.580
fun party games.

09:30.580 --> 09:33.220
I think it's a good title, and 20 bucks, not bad.

09:33.220 --> 09:38.040
So I definitely would recommend Bomberman DS for anybody looking for just a quick puzzle,

09:38.040 --> 09:43.220
or you got a lot of friends with DS's looking for a new game to play, Bomberman DS is for

09:43.220 --> 09:44.220
you.

09:44.220 --> 09:49.960
wise I had my birthday on the 26th I know I don't want to talk about my age

09:49.960 --> 09:55.500
but some of my friends got together and bought me a PSP which was very cool so I

09:55.500 --> 10:00.660
have PSP now and of course the very first thing I did with it because yeah I

10:00.660 --> 10:02.940
don't know if you guys were listening to this show like I don't know a couple

10:02.940 --> 10:06.620
months ago but I actually picked up a copy of luminous before I had a PSP and

10:06.620 --> 10:09.220
I just let my friend borrow it cuz I'm like you can't get a PSP and not get

10:09.220 --> 10:13.940
luminous I will buy it for when I get a PSP well he still has my copy of luminous

10:13.940 --> 10:17.900
Unfortunately, so I have nothing to play on my PSP right now. So the very first thing I do in my PSP

10:17.900 --> 10:20.780
I've fired up the homebrew page

10:21.460 --> 10:28.060
On the internet and I downloaded some Nintendo emulator and some ROMs Dan's been going crazy with that. We've got awesome

10:28.060 --> 10:30.060
We've got a gigabyte memory card. It's awesome

10:30.540 --> 10:32.980
So yeah, he's got something like 50 ROMs on it

10:32.980 --> 10:36.500
It kind of works out for Sony in the long run too because you know

10:36.500 --> 10:42.500
Nintendo has been selling some of these games for $20 a pop and now people can play them for free on their PSP

10:42.500 --> 10:46.240
Although it's one of those things that nobody's supposed to talk about, but yeah

10:46.520 --> 10:49.640
You can't this kind of thing has to be a selling point for the PSP

10:50.040 --> 10:55.560
Yeah for some people for me. It definitely sells it so Loki. I'll let you start tonight

10:55.560 --> 10:59.200
I know you probably I I kind of spoiled it there. We've got the no swap

11:00.120 --> 11:02.120
trick there now for the

11:02.280 --> 11:09.520
Emulators, but what else is new in the hack and crack scene well that that was pretty much the news this week was that the new

11:09.520 --> 11:15.960
exploit was released on Wednesday I believe and it's basically not very

11:15.960 --> 11:20.240
different from the last exploit you basically have two folders on one memory

11:20.240 --> 11:25.400
card except one of them has a percent sign at the end of it and you basically

11:25.400 --> 11:33.560
have your two sets of eboot files and it just runs off your memory card now no

11:33.560 --> 11:39.000
need to swap just go. What an easy fix that'll be for Sony though so careful

11:39.000 --> 11:41.840
when you play Grand Theft Auto because you know they're gonna load it on there

11:41.840 --> 11:47.160
sooner than that actually really first game in July coded arms is gonna be one

11:47.160 --> 11:52.020
that's gonna force it up to one five two however why are coded arms only gonna be

11:52.020 --> 11:56.800
one five no one five two that's the Japanese one

11:56.800 --> 12:02.080
five two and guess what folks but they're working on one five one one five

12:02.080 --> 12:05.880
two already and it's gonna be a matter of time before that's not even an issue

12:05.880 --> 12:10.840
It's gonna be like Trillion and AOL like every time AOL patches their server

12:10.840 --> 12:17.060
So Trillion can't use it anymore within two days Trillion has a workaround. It's just gonna be the same thing. It's great. And

12:17.880 --> 12:24.160
So yeah, that that's it's been the major news. Actually, it's been some cool homebrew games coming out, you know

12:24.160 --> 12:26.600
Some blackjack casino stuff that's kind of neat

12:27.200 --> 12:29.200
actually another thing that was

12:29.440 --> 12:31.440
pretty interesting was

12:31.440 --> 12:35.360
the Game Boy Advance Simulator actually for the Game Boy Advance Simulator

12:35.360 --> 12:39.560
PSP PSP interesting how's it full-speed I'm runs pretty good

12:39.560 --> 12:42.800
I'm the only thing it does it's limited to I'm files that are

12:42.800 --> 12:46.680
under 8 megs it all right the ROMs have to be under the Nintendo one's not

12:46.680 --> 12:49.600
perfect the Nintendo one I notice wouldn't play life force was one

12:49.600 --> 12:50.440
favorite Nintendo games

12:50.440 --> 12:55.320
and one play a gyrus so it's is not the other games that I won't play

12:55.320 --> 12:58.320
the well the two I feel you actually find Guardian legend though

12:58.320 --> 13:03.240
to test it. I have it. Yeah, you have to check also

13:03.240 --> 13:07.000
what was I gonna say? The fantasy zone. Just like

13:07.000 --> 13:10.400
you have to watch the

13:10.400 --> 13:14.680
ROM dumps. Sometimes some of them are bad and you can get a new dump and that's

13:14.680 --> 13:19.720
works fine. It's just, you know, you just have to watch. Actually, Dan tried the

13:19.720 --> 13:23.480
Game Boy Advance one and it ran Fire Emblem like crap.

13:23.480 --> 13:29.560
He said it ran it so slow that it was a torture to play it.

13:29.560 --> 13:32.720
She didn't bother with it.

13:32.720 --> 13:36.360
You know now that we're seeing that the things get this advanced you gotta go

13:36.360 --> 13:39.960
well you know if Sony is gonna try and screw with people so that they're gonna

13:39.960 --> 13:41.640
their firmware is gonna be forced to upgrade

13:41.640 --> 13:45.160
you really can't blame them because this could be this could get ugly

13:45.160 --> 13:48.960
if this gets big. But technically it's money out of their pockets.

13:48.960 --> 13:52.840
It's gonna get ugly if this stuff gets too mainstream. The other thing I was gonna mention is

13:52.840 --> 13:57.600
a game coming out later on this year, this summer, Burnout Legends. One of the unique

13:57.600 --> 14:02.680
things about it is it will be able to share a demo level with other people via download

14:02.680 --> 14:09.680
play type thing. So that's kind of a first also for the PSP, which is kind of neat. And

14:09.960 --> 14:15.080
I know that's already been built into it and you'll be able to download games or whatnot,

14:15.080 --> 14:20.300
hopefully to your memory stick. So that will be coming out with Burnout Legends and then

14:20.300 --> 14:26.220
also really there's some good games coming out I know Midnight Club 3 just

14:26.220 --> 14:30.180
got released so that's gonna be coming out you know next week so you can pick

14:30.180 --> 14:34.140
that up and then you know a bunch of cool stuff coming out MIDI evil they're

14:34.140 --> 14:37.620
working on so it's a good summer for PSP.

14:37.620 --> 14:40.700
Alright cool. One quick question I just want to pose to you guys and those of you

14:40.700 --> 14:44.860
that are listening at home as well I'm kind of curious with the news about the

14:44.860 --> 14:48.620
Nintendo emulation and everything usually people say emulation is not a

14:48.620 --> 14:52.360
a bad thing because you're only playing things that you can't buy in the store

14:52.360 --> 14:55.460
anymore and that's kind of that's like the justification you've seen this is

14:55.460 --> 15:00.640
this Nintendo emulation ethical considering that Nintendo is still

15:00.640 --> 15:03.860
trying to profit off some of these old titles through their GBA classic series

15:03.860 --> 15:10.240
what do you think from a support standpoint you know it is not ethical I

15:10.240 --> 15:16.440
believe because technically all right so they're like example they're we

15:16.440 --> 15:21.540
releasing Zelda you know that's out but say that you have an emulator to play it

15:21.540 --> 15:27.020
that is however much say $35 that Nintendo is not going to get now say

15:27.020 --> 15:32.100
that this is you times about a hundred other people that's $3500 that

15:32.100 --> 15:36.100
Nintendo's not getting that means that any future game that comes out it's

15:36.100 --> 15:38.980
going to jack the price because they have to make up for loss of sales on

15:38.980 --> 15:43.660
that you know I know that they figure this in though when they set price points

15:43.660 --> 15:47.700
But the thing is is that the price is going to keep going up the more that this goes on

15:48.940 --> 15:55.180
Counterpoint counterpoint is they shouldn't be trying to resell fucking the first game of Zelda in the first place

15:55.180 --> 15:58.960
I'm not gonna pay $20 for a game. That's been out for years now

15:58.980 --> 16:02.280
Why should I have to buy some stupid game to run on the Gameboy Advance?

16:02.280 --> 16:04.780
I'm gonna run a damn emulator and play it for free and

16:05.220 --> 16:11.300
That's my take on even their other stuff with the new revolution big whoopity-doo. There's new graphics

16:11.300 --> 16:13.660
Well, yeah, and then this kind of leads into one story

16:13.660 --> 16:18.900
You know what? I would rather play every release on my Gameboy Advance than play an emulator

16:19.500 --> 16:25.620
Because you technically I could just plug in my Nintendo and play it all I want to it's kind of like if I'm hearing you

16:25.620 --> 16:31.300
Right. It's kind of like downloading mp3s from the internet and buying them off iTunes when you buy something iTunes, you know

16:31.300 --> 16:36.260
I don't support iTunes. Well, okay or another service a comparable service when you use one of these

16:36.260 --> 16:44.880
services you know you're going to get the highest quality yeah file yeah as

16:44.880 --> 16:48.620
opposed to when you try to use lime wire so you're gonna get fake files crappy

16:48.620 --> 16:53.080
sounding ones people trying to mess with you and stuff is that kind of how it is

16:53.080 --> 16:57.760
with ROMs versus I'll pay for quality I'll pay for quality one thing that I do

16:57.760 --> 17:04.640
support ROMs for is for games that have been heavily edited and games that are

17:04.640 --> 17:08.000
just not coming out over here then I will run a translation patch on him and

17:08.000 --> 17:14.120
like translated like second century yeah okay like the the first Fire Emblem on

17:14.120 --> 17:17.920
the Game Boy Advance they never brought that the one with Roy and Marth never

17:17.920 --> 17:23.240
brought that out over here my thought is you know I owned the Zelda cartridge

17:23.240 --> 17:27.600
back in the day so I feel justified in emulating you know granted maybe I'm

17:27.600 --> 17:31.720
playing some other things I didn't necessarily own but I don't know I still

17:31.720 --> 17:35.920
feel like you know I'm buying enough of their new stuff and usually if they if

17:35.920 --> 17:41.280
they bring out Zelda redone or I'm trying to think of some of the some of

17:41.280 --> 17:44.800
the other games that they've done like redone recently I mean maybe Metroid

17:44.800 --> 17:47.880
Zero but that's a little loose because it wasn't exactly first game I buy that

17:47.880 --> 17:52.200
stuff right up but if you think about you asked if it is ethical no it is not

17:52.200 --> 17:59.720
ethical is it logical yes it is okay but I don't know nobody's perfect

17:59.720 --> 18:05.880
Your thoughts at home welcomed togo at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email togo at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

18:05.880 --> 18:09.280
I think it's ethical because they're not putting Nintendo games in the new

18:09.280 --> 18:12.800
Animal Crossing DS. It's damn ethical.

18:12.800 --> 18:17.640
No, that's not ethical. That's the difference between ethics and logic. You are going from a

18:17.640 --> 18:19.920
logical standpoint and not an ethical standpoint.

18:19.920 --> 18:23.640
And trust me, I took three semesters of philosophy so I should know this.

18:23.640 --> 18:26.920
Martha Stewart went to jail over this stuff. I'm just kidding, alright.

18:26.920 --> 18:29.680
It is not ethical. Let's move on. Let's move on

18:29.680 --> 18:33.100
All right, your thoughts again to go at orange launch radio comm to be continued maybe

18:33.720 --> 18:37.860
Zelda Zelda DS, huh, or we will publicly break you over here

18:38.540 --> 18:43.200
Zelda DS they are working on one and in an interview with Wired magazine

18:43.200 --> 18:51.080
The Legend of Zelda producer says that the Nintendo DS version of Zelda will be primarily controlled via the touchscreen and stylus

18:51.220 --> 18:53.220
to which I say

18:53.220 --> 19:02.040
sigh exactly now I'm I can't judge till I see it because you know Castlevania DS

19:02.040 --> 19:07.160
has the stylus thing but it's it's tasteful it's it's limited it's not

19:07.160 --> 19:13.720
overboard with it it makes sense so I'm I'm hoping that one word okay what

19:13.720 --> 19:21.440
her own just I don't know I I'm a little scared I have to see more on this but

19:21.440 --> 19:25.960
news does kinda make me go, do they have to whore this out in every game?

19:25.960 --> 19:29.160
Well you know they did build it into the system for a reason.

19:29.160 --> 19:33.680
I'm just, but, but it's, but isn't one of the other selling points supposed to be two-screen?

19:33.680 --> 19:37.140
That's like saying god damn those Nintendo games and using the god damn A button.

19:37.140 --> 19:39.800
Why does every game have to use the A button?

19:39.800 --> 19:41.520
It's there for a reason, they use it.

19:41.520 --> 19:45.380
Think about classic Zelda, you would never have to hit the menu button again because

19:45.380 --> 19:47.980
you could always have your menu on the top screen.

19:47.980 --> 19:48.980
That's all you need.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.640
And that's being innovative with the DS.

19:50.640 --> 19:56.600
that's right they called it the DS not the s at the first stylus or the TV TM

19:56.600 --> 20:06.120
touch me I don't know TM FM TMI you know we were talking about movies last week

20:06.120 --> 20:08.600
we're talking about all the movie games that are coming out and by the way we

20:08.600 --> 20:12.920
got a correction the the postal thing that's gonna be directed by ue Bowl not

20:12.920 --> 20:17.760
really gonna be directed by ue Bowl it's or it's rumor still no confirmation oh

20:17.760 --> 20:23.160
We kind of ran it last week. Like it was confirmed. It is not so, you know, sorry. He's directing mistakes

20:23.160 --> 20:29.560
He is directing the rated-r version of Tetris the movie. Stop it. He is doing Dungeon Siege though. That is that is

20:30.160 --> 20:32.120
true and now

20:32.120 --> 20:34.880
We've got another game that's going to be made into a movie

20:34.880 --> 20:40.360
We kind of knew about this one for a while American McGee's version of Alice, you know, like Alice in Wonderland

20:41.120 --> 20:45.800
You could say it's Tim Burton meets Tarantino meets just a big bag of crack, basically

20:45.800 --> 20:51.640
That's how you could describe Alice. I guess I don't know and you have to have like a really happy computer who run it a

20:52.600 --> 20:57.480
Few years when if game first came out. Yeah now it's in most computers could probably handle it

20:57.480 --> 21:02.620
Well, they're making a movie out of it and they have casted Sarah Michelle Geller the one you know

21:02.620 --> 21:04.620
What woman needs to eat something?

21:05.320 --> 21:13.060
Cuz in the grudge, she was like bone thin. Mm-hmm, and she was really in good shape when she was on Buffy

21:13.060 --> 21:19.060
mm-hmm you know cuz she consistently had to exercise for the role and to eat

21:19.060 --> 21:24.380
directed by Marcus Nispel who did the recent remake of the Texas Chainsaw

21:24.380 --> 21:27.620
Massacre I'm thinking maybe being pregnant will help her look better you

21:27.620 --> 21:31.420
know less anorexic they really need to put like Natalie poor I would not the

21:31.420 --> 21:34.200
first rumors I heard were that Natalie Portman would be in it and right now

21:34.200 --> 21:37.180
after you'd be better after seeing closer now we portman's just being

21:37.180 --> 21:42.860
everything I think not only portman's hot and she she could at least be more

21:42.860 --> 21:51.980
gothy than you know Sarah Michelle Geller was Buffy you guys oh well in

21:51.980 --> 21:55.480
that case let me just stop all the press let's put her in every movie because you

21:55.480 --> 22:02.300
know she was Buffy oh no when she was on Buffy she looks healthy I cannot stand

22:02.300 --> 22:06.740
seeing Sarah Michelle Geller the way she looks now except that I'm hoping being

22:06.740 --> 22:11.180
pregnant will encourage her to eat food and not look like a starved little crow

22:11.180 --> 22:17.020
because she looks like she's freaking anorexic and she's no longer pretty all

22:17.020 --> 22:21.340
right well this seems like a very good segue into letting dark Sakura give you

22:21.340 --> 22:25.260
a little piece of her mind because you know what if we played video games all

22:25.260 --> 22:30.740
day long we'd have no time to go eat at hometown buffet honestly damn straight

22:30.740 --> 22:35.140
so we have we're gonna bring you some advice brought to you by the one and

22:35.140 --> 22:39.420
only dark Sakura because you know she's just she's that cuz I said so she's the

22:39.420 --> 22:46.740
happy furry bunny of our show. I'm not furry, I shaved my legs. Okay dark sagra, so what

22:46.740 --> 22:54.740
are you going to be talking to us about tonight? Speaking of babies, today's advice column

22:54.740 --> 23:02.900
is how to deliver a baby. Like, in the postage mail? Like if you're at Walmart. Hey, that

23:02.900 --> 23:03.900
Hey!

23:03.900 --> 23:04.900
My water broke!

23:04.900 --> 23:07.660
That was a Natalie Portman roll, remember that?

23:07.660 --> 23:09.980
Sadly enough it was.

23:09.980 --> 23:13.560
Number one, time the uterine contraction.

23:13.560 --> 23:19.100
For first time mothers when contractions are about 3-5 minutes apart and last 40-90 seconds

23:19.100 --> 23:23.380
and increase in strength and frequency for at least an hour, the labor is most likely

23:23.380 --> 23:24.380
real and not false.

23:24.380 --> 23:29.140
I just want to point out, all you 13-21 year old guys, which is the primary demographic

23:29.140 --> 23:31.880
listening to the show keep that in mind

23:31.880 --> 23:34.180
time your uterine contractions it's not

23:34.180 --> 23:37.680
trying to eat you dear shut up have

23:37.680 --> 23:40.180
clean dry towels a clean shirt or

23:40.180 --> 23:43.240
something similar on hand number two as

23:43.240 --> 23:45.640
the baby moves out of the womb its head

23:45.640 --> 23:47.800
the biggest part of its body will open

23:47.800 --> 23:49.320
the cervix so the rest of it can pass

23:49.320 --> 23:52.840
through three when the baby is out of

23:52.840 --> 23:54.520
the mother dry it off and keep it warm

23:54.520 --> 23:56.520
God, I'm having flashbacks to the miracle of life.

23:56.520 --> 23:58.520
Shut up! Shut up!

23:58.520 --> 24:02.520
If necessary, clear any fluid out of the baby's mouth with your fingers.

24:02.520 --> 24:05.520
4. Tie off the umbilical cord.

24:05.520 --> 24:10.520
Take a piece of string, a shoelace works as well, and tie off the cord several inches from the baby.

24:10.520 --> 24:12.520
Do not cut the umbilical cord.

24:12.520 --> 24:14.520
5. Get to a hospital.

24:14.520 --> 24:16.520
But my ultimate piece of advice in regards to that?

24:16.520 --> 24:17.520
Yes.

24:17.520 --> 24:20.520
Freakin' have your midwife follow you everywhere you go.

24:20.520 --> 24:22.520
And don't go to Walmart!

24:22.520 --> 24:27.080
number six get it to the black market ASAP because the value of babies goes

24:27.080 --> 24:27.960
down dramatically

24:27.960 --> 24:31.000
right in the just stop just up alright

24:31.000 --> 24:36.240
alright horrible person moving on actually I was going around passing this

24:36.240 --> 24:38.280
around all my co-workers at work it was great

24:38.280 --> 24:42.280
like half of them are pregnant let's let's continue on with the baby theme

24:42.280 --> 24:43.600
but this is kind of a

24:43.600 --> 24:47.040
this is just sick I really don't know how else to explain this but

24:47.040 --> 24:50.080
I this is one of those things is going around on email

24:50.080 --> 24:53.640
which kind of makes me question if it's even legit or not but you know it's

24:53.640 --> 24:56.700
running on a lot of the big gaming website so I'm thinking that's got to be

24:56.700 --> 25:02.860
legit but in Korea there's stories announced out there that there was a

25:02.860 --> 25:07.020
mother and father who went to an internet cafe and they were playing

25:07.020 --> 25:11.920
World of Warcraft and when they returned home they found their four-month-old

25:11.920 --> 25:18.740
daughter who dead basically because they left the daughter alone of course the

25:18.740 --> 25:22.340
couple has been booked on criminal charges the couple's defense by the way

25:22.340 --> 25:27.020
we were thinking of playing for just an hour or two and returning home like

25:27.020 --> 25:33.980
usual but the game took longer that day so they've done this before the infant

25:33.980 --> 25:39.600
was the couple's only child thank God when I shot themselves in the ass for

25:39.600 --> 25:47.000
that what's I deserve it no baby deserves it the baby the baby doesn't

25:47.000 --> 25:50.780
deserve it but the parent sure as hell do I just uh it's just they were like

25:50.780 --> 26:00.660
I'd give my first born to make level 57 tonight see you can dress those cards

26:00.660 --> 26:08.900
and letters to Loki I don't know it's sadly enough the story doesn't surprise

26:08.900 --> 26:15.440
me because there's idiots in the world yeah in in in the United States in

26:15.440 --> 26:22.000
Bolivia everywhere now there needs to be a standardized test before they let you breed if that was in the United States

26:22.000 --> 26:27.040
It'd be the baby was dead in the car because they have the windows rolled up along with their dog

26:30.300 --> 26:32.740
No comment from blizzard on that by the way, but

26:35.320 --> 26:40.960
It's not their fault there you can bet somebody would there will be a parent's council out there in the world

26:40.960 --> 26:45.560
Can I say that World of Warcraft causes babies to die?

26:45.560 --> 26:50.360
Tell me there won't be this Parents Council for Freedom of Ameri- whatever, somewhere

26:50.360 --> 26:53.720
that will say, World of Warcraft kills babies!

26:53.720 --> 26:54.720
World of Warcraft!

26:54.720 --> 26:57.720
I almost said World of Warcraft.

26:57.720 --> 27:00.440
I honestly, I haven't spent serious time with World of Warcraft.

27:00.440 --> 27:04.360
I can't judge it one way or the other, but Final Fantasy XI won't kill your babies.

27:04.360 --> 27:07.520
It probably did kill some of these dogs somewhere.

27:07.520 --> 27:08.960
You can play in windowed mode.

27:08.960 --> 27:13.400
me there will not be somebody some parents counsel say World of Warcraft

27:13.400 --> 27:17.280
kills babies and should be taken off store shelves it's poisoning our youth

27:17.280 --> 27:25.120
dot dot dot I'm surprised people that you know never mind not gonna go there

27:25.120 --> 27:29.160
yeah good idea how many babies died on EverQuest let's talk about something

27:29.160 --> 27:33.080
when it leaves EverQuest can have babies let's talk about let's talk about Neopets

27:33.080 --> 27:37.080
Ah! Mine are dead! Everybody loves Neopets, right?

27:37.080 --> 27:40.080
I checked on mine and they're dead. Do your Neopets die now?

27:40.080 --> 27:44.080
I couldn't get to my pets. I had a Neopet like five years ago, I think.

27:44.080 --> 27:48.080
And now Iguana Girl has your Neopet. And I think it's dead now.

27:48.080 --> 27:51.080
She adopted my Neopet like years ago. You had a Neopet once, right?

27:51.080 --> 27:54.080
I had four Neopets. And they're all dead.

27:54.080 --> 27:57.080
What did you do? Did you leave them alone while you went to play World of Warcraft?

27:57.080 --> 28:01.080
I don't know. I just got bored with them because I couldn't access it from work anymore.

28:01.080 --> 28:04.200
it from work anymore is it just me or did Neopets like slowly go downhill

28:04.200 --> 28:08.280
over the years and you know since they got a video game and a trade in a

28:08.280 --> 28:13.200
collectible card game and then you know I I remember walking by Claire's one day

28:13.200 --> 28:16.320
I didn't go in there but I walked by it one day and there were selling Neopets

28:16.320 --> 28:21.480
stuff and I'm just like I'm glad I plan is limited to me they're all the same

28:21.480 --> 28:24.120
one of those girly store what stupid spoiled whores whatever those two

28:24.120 --> 28:31.000
remember pogs yeah you remember Neopets no yeah see we pogs and Neopets

28:31.000 --> 28:34.680
are in the same family here it is Neopets may not be as far away as you

28:34.680 --> 28:41.640
think because MTV bought Neopets that's right MTV networks home of music

28:41.640 --> 28:47.360
television haha but Neopets so that means that Neopets is gonna start

28:47.360 --> 28:52.720
sucking even more or it will be something else maybe they can bring a

28:52.720 --> 28:58.280
Neopets show to MTV so they can continue to not play music just a thought I

28:58.280 --> 29:00.280
Already hate MTV

29:02.120 --> 29:07.720
Do you want to get into why it's only except that they gave me a really really neat gorillas commercials, but apart from that

29:08.880 --> 29:14.920
There's a lot. There's a lot of good things that have come from MTV remote control. Yeah, this is not on anymore

29:14.920 --> 29:18.000
They're all from the 80 Adam Curry who is

29:19.320 --> 29:23.200
The godfather of podcasting so we love you Adam Curry. Yeah

29:23.200 --> 29:27.200
Just saying, not everything from MTV is bad, just everything in the past 10, 15 years.

29:27.200 --> 29:33.200
I'm talking about currently, MTV is just degraded into this big festering pile of dog poopy.

29:33.200 --> 29:35.200
Tell us how you really feel.

29:35.200 --> 29:41.200
Okay, even more than being a big festering pile of dog poopy, they don't play music anymore.

29:41.200 --> 29:46.200
The music they do play sucks, unless it's Gorillaz or Blur or Superfur animals.

29:46.200 --> 29:47.200
They don't play Blur anymore.

29:47.200 --> 29:48.200
They used to.

29:48.200 --> 29:49.200
Well, not here in America.

29:49.200 --> 29:50.200
Like, one song.

29:50.200 --> 29:51.200
I know.

29:51.200 --> 29:52.200
Anyway, moving on, moving on.

29:52.200 --> 30:00.200
another network Kids WB Kids WB will be getting 26 episodes of Viewtiful Joe

30:00.200 --> 30:05.360
which will be coming onto the network in the fall two new Viewtiful Joe games are

30:05.360 --> 30:09.100
on their way out by the way so honestly does this surprise anyone that has been

30:09.100 --> 30:16.620
made in a cartoon so I don't stay up on the the animes so correct me it is an

30:16.620 --> 30:21.280
anime it has been out for some time I downloaded the first couple episodes of

30:21.280 --> 30:28.840
this like last year and it's on crack and kids WB is going to butcher it and

30:28.840 --> 30:33.280
it would no longer retain its coolness now now now kids WB didn't butcher

30:33.280 --> 30:38.720
Pokemon yeah yeah they did yeah they did yeah they did all right that's right I

30:38.720 --> 30:44.880
used to watch Japanese and they and then you didn't see what they did I know I

30:44.880 --> 30:48.880
can't believe kids WB took out all the strobing that was in that show and it

30:48.880 --> 30:56.120
took out the boob scene the part where um I'm cold you know what was he in the

30:56.120 --> 31:02.200
u.s. would not remember James yeah he was doing some modeling thing trying to

31:02.200 --> 31:05.800
pretend trying to pass off as a woman so they could get another Pokemon and had

31:05.800 --> 31:09.640
inflatable boobs and they took that episode out you know any of our

31:09.640 --> 31:12.540
listeners that did get that reference are probably embarrassed to admit they

31:12.540 --> 31:16.920
did and then they butchered Digimon cuz Digimon was cool are there any TV

31:16.920 --> 31:24.080
networks you do like I like sci-fi they play Stargate and the food network for

31:24.080 --> 31:28.360
Iron Chef well I don't have and I like court TV and the history channel and

31:28.360 --> 31:32.160
biography alright so okay sorry I don't have a news story on any of those

31:32.160 --> 31:37.280
channels but I do have a news story about g4 television for gamers yay g

31:37.280 --> 31:43.880
like g4 for you has their nominees coming out for I'm sorry g4 has their

31:43.880 --> 31:48.260
nominees coming out for G4ia which is going to be taking place live August no

31:48.260 --> 31:52.260
I'm sorry it's July 27th but will be shown on August 9th so it's not really

31:52.260 --> 31:55.640
live it's one of those tape delay things but whatever they're doing things a

31:55.640 --> 32:00.440
little differently this year industry experts select the nominees the gamers

32:00.440 --> 32:03.140
get to vote on them I guess it's probably through their website or

32:03.140 --> 32:09.740
something so yeah so we get more low is it hmm we want to hear what some of the

32:09.740 --> 32:12.820
industry experts picked when you hear some categories now I'm sure I'm sure

32:12.820 --> 32:16.660
G4's website what are they G4TV.com I'm sure they have the big list of all the

32:16.660 --> 32:20.500
games but we've got some of them I wanted to just share some of these

32:20.500 --> 32:27.580
jazz jackrabbit best innovation Donkey Kong jungle beat feel the magic XY

32:27.580 --> 32:32.860
xx katamari damashi full spectrum warrior and psi ops the mind gate

32:32.860 --> 32:38.660
conspiracy okay okay this I ops is a good game why would feel the magic get a

32:38.660 --> 32:42.540
a nomination because it's a ripoff of WarioWare and luminous doesn't

32:42.540 --> 32:46.540
I don't but I don't know okay best original soundtrack

32:46.540 --> 32:50.660
Katamari Damacy fable World of Warcraft

32:50.660 --> 32:53.660
Halo 2 God of War now

32:53.660 --> 32:56.780
granted all those games actually had really good soundtracks I can't I can't

32:56.780 --> 32:58.540
argue with that especially Katamari Damacy

32:58.540 --> 33:02.940
especially that one but for the types of games they were actually really enjoyed

33:02.940 --> 33:04.060
fable soundtrack as well

33:04.060 --> 33:07.220
there's another category for licensed soundtrack which luminous was in but

33:07.220 --> 33:08.460
gonna win you know huh

33:08.460 --> 33:11.360
halo's gonna win because everyone votes halo no matter what they could be like

33:11.360 --> 33:15.980
best breakfast cereal halo can be a nominee up against Froot Loops or

33:15.980 --> 33:19.820
something like that they'll be halo that's not cereal right Nintendo

33:19.820 --> 33:25.380
breakfast system best original game psyops the mindgate conspiracy full

33:25.380 --> 33:31.580
spectrum warrior god of war katamari damashi and psychonauts god of war or

33:31.580 --> 33:35.260
katamari katamari here it is game of the year

33:35.260 --> 33:36.780
half-life 2

33:36.780 --> 33:38.120
halo 2

33:38.120 --> 33:39.600
world of warcraft

33:39.600 --> 33:40.960
god of war

33:40.960 --> 33:42.580
resident evil 4

33:42.580 --> 33:46.620
grand theft auto san andreas who that's a toughie katamari damashi should be in

33:46.620 --> 33:46.940
there

33:46.940 --> 33:50.700
and maybe no no i disagree with

33:50.700 --> 33:51.980
the entire list

33:51.980 --> 33:55.860
the production values though for god of war you can't really

33:55.860 --> 33:57.340
considering

33:57.340 --> 34:01.260
the audience in mind and the gaming public as a general, we play a certain

34:01.260 --> 34:04.020
niche of games. Taking the gaming public as a general,

34:04.020 --> 34:05.240
I guess,

34:05.240 --> 34:09.660
this list doesn't surprise me at all. This honestly seems like a

34:09.660 --> 34:15.300
fair representation. I bet these experts were like the lunchtime poll in Heathers.

34:15.300 --> 34:19.100
If the world was going to explode tomorrow and you had six million dollars today,

34:19.100 --> 34:20.580
what would you do with it?

34:20.580 --> 34:23.100
I'd go buy me Halo 2.

34:23.100 --> 34:27.100
would have liked to have seen like a little like a niche title a black horse

34:27.100 --> 34:32.140
candidate if you will like Katamari Damacy or luminous or something but

34:32.140 --> 34:38.180
didn't happen what can you say so check that out if you want to it's over on g4

34:38.180 --> 34:43.420
guitar hero that's the new game coming out harmonics is teaming up with red

34:43.420 --> 34:46.900
octane it looks like a cross between karaoke revolution guitar freaks some

34:46.900 --> 34:50.820
songs some songs have been announced and you know how they kind of did like cover

34:50.820 --> 34:54.380
songs in karaoke revolution well it's gonna be the same deal they're gonna do

34:54.380 --> 34:58.100
cover songs and guitar hero but the covers and karaoke revolution weren't

34:58.100 --> 35:01.980
bad I've definitely heard worse they weren't bad so this should be

35:01.980 --> 35:04.980
interesting the guitar hero here's some of the songs are gonna be in it red hot

35:04.980 --> 35:10.260
chili peppers with higher ground Boston more than a feelin mega death symphony

35:10.260 --> 35:15.500
of destruction Donna's take it off Jimi Hendrix Spanish castle magic ZZ top

35:15.500 --> 35:20.780
sharp-dressed man Black Sabbath Iron Man white zombie Thunder kiss 65 Queen of

35:20.780 --> 35:27.620
the stone age no one knows David Bowie Ziggy Stardust dated France Ferdinand

35:27.620 --> 35:33.740
take me out deep purple smoke on the water cream crossroads some 41 you had

35:33.740 --> 35:38.460
me at David Bowie I love Ziggy Stardust very I kind of like the direction

35:38.460 --> 35:41.600
they're going with this because it got a lot of like classic guitar blended with

35:41.600 --> 35:45.920
the newer bands that are known for guitars style of play that makes me

35:45.920 --> 35:50.660
think of that Johnny whatever on the gizmondo a little bit know what I love

35:50.660 --> 35:53.140
and they should have put it in there. It's aerodynamical.

35:53.140 --> 35:56.020
Well this is just partial. It's just partial. Daft Punk.

35:56.020 --> 35:59.060
That has one hell of a guitar solo in it. We'll see.

35:59.060 --> 36:02.480
Somebody brought this up a little earlier in the show but I just want to clarify the

36:02.480 --> 36:04.660
Revolution, Nintendo Revolution,

36:04.660 --> 36:09.180
there was a report over on Joystick.com, that's with a Q.

36:09.180 --> 36:14.260
Joystick.com is reporting that they will be getting a graphical

36:14.260 --> 36:16.700
upgrade. Remember how

36:16.700 --> 36:23.720
And they announced we months ago that Nintendo and Super Nintendo titles all the way up through 64 titles

36:23.760 --> 36:29.960
Will be downloadable through the revolution. They're gonna get a graphical upgrade of some sort is now what they're saying now

36:29.960 --> 36:31.960
If it's gonna be new sprites

36:32.080 --> 36:36.520
like they did like think Mario all-stars got new sprites or if it's gonna be more like

36:36.840 --> 36:42.900
Emulation and you look at emulators and how like if you play I don't know say like eat Kid Icarus or something

36:42.900 --> 36:48.360
it's smooth you know what keeps popping through my head in the Satellaview hmm

36:48.360 --> 36:52.660
which was we didn't get it over here but it was like a download system where you

36:52.660 --> 36:56.660
could you can actually download the ROMs for it now the upgraded Zelda for

36:56.660 --> 37:01.340
Satellaview there were a bunch of different games but they were all

37:01.340 --> 37:05.740
downloadable you could play them for a time limit and then okay okay now I

37:05.740 --> 37:09.220
can't see them going back and reskinning all their old games so I don't think

37:09.220 --> 37:12.300
it's that although maybe for some of them it will be because like we were

37:12.300 --> 37:16.280
saying earlier in the show why would you pay to download this stuff when you can

37:16.280 --> 37:19.800
emulate it for free well maybe that's a big incentive you know to play Kid

37:19.800 --> 37:23.360
Icarus with like really nice you know Super Nintendo or even better graphics

37:23.360 --> 37:27.320
I'd pay for that I really would I would I just want a freaking sequel to that

37:27.320 --> 37:32.840
game that's all is that too much to ask I had to be asked what the code was for

37:32.840 --> 37:38.320
Kid Icarus by the way Icarus fights Medusa angels can't you also do Medusa

37:38.320 --> 37:41.600
fights Icarus angels and it's like a different I thought you could I'll try

37:41.600 --> 37:45.280
I haven't think you can flip it and you get something else. It's been a it's been a while

37:45.280 --> 37:50.680
I don't I don't cheat on games terror danger horror exclamation point. That was the other one

37:54.280 --> 37:56.280
This story I think is very interesting

37:56.960 --> 38:02.440
You know how you can buy things on MMOs like with real money and eBay and saying it's kind of controversial

38:02.440 --> 38:04.440
Does it ruin the game doesn't not that it?

38:04.700 --> 38:09.040
Well, there is a report and I actually picked this up off a slashdot earlier this week

38:09.040 --> 38:14.720
they're running a story about game pal and game pal what it does is it allows

38:14.720 --> 38:18.480
you to rent a character in an online world so I think it might be a play on

38:18.480 --> 38:21.480
the term game fly because you know how like that's a rental service well game

38:21.480 --> 38:28.800
pal for just a $300 deposit and for $150 for the first month and 130 for each

38:28.800 --> 38:34.160
month after that you can have your choice of up to 50 accounts one of 50

38:34.160 --> 38:40.400
accounts for 14 popular MMOs, Star Wars Galaxies, Ultima Online, EverQuest, City of

38:40.400 --> 38:44.240
Heroes, but the trick is is that when you're renting these characters you're

38:44.240 --> 38:48.440
renting God characters you're renting the highest they go so you know maximum

38:48.440 --> 38:54.840
level all the good gear what do you think? Is this a practical idea or is it a

38:54.840 --> 39:00.880
big joke? Pisses me off like for example on Ragnarok I put in what two and a half

39:00.880 --> 39:05.760
years into my character to get her to level 70 something and then it would

39:05.760 --> 39:09.200
just piss me off to see someone come in with a level 100 character right off the

39:09.200 --> 39:12.400
bat it's ridiculous it's interesting because they're renting these characters

39:12.400 --> 39:15.000
not selling them they're renting them and they should charge even more the

39:15.000 --> 39:18.480
prices are a little weird they should Jack those prices even more make him

39:18.480 --> 39:22.600
pay for that privilege Loki I know you've openly admitted to you don't care

39:22.600 --> 39:26.800
buy your money online I think it's stupid really kind of money for that

39:26.800 --> 39:31.680
an idiot would honestly you know for that kind of money you could be buying a

39:31.680 --> 39:35.840
lot of you know online currency and you know get your character maxed anyways

39:35.840 --> 39:39.880
hell I'd be almost tempted to see you know what that deposit was for in the

39:39.880 --> 39:44.320
first place otherwise it just rent a god character and accidentally send all my

39:44.320 --> 39:49.840
stuff to someone else you know and money you could actually buy groceries for two

39:49.840 --> 39:53.240
weeks you can use that as a car payment feature

39:53.240 --> 39:58.120
you get a babysitter for your baby when you go out to you know you know god

39:58.120 --> 40:03.480
damn it people live in the real fucking world okay games are fine every now and

40:03.480 --> 40:07.520
again but keep in mind that your money you know you should use it responsibly

40:07.520 --> 40:11.960
or else you're gonna end up like one of those losers whose baby died you'll be a

40:11.960 --> 40:16.360
loser not a winner but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't play your games at

40:16.360 --> 40:20.120
all another World of Warcraft story I have for you guys they're getting an

40:20.120 --> 40:23.200
expansion pack and that's pretty much all I have to say there's really

40:23.200 --> 40:27.200
a whole lot of news besides that they announced that they're making an expansion pack that's

40:27.200 --> 40:33.680
kind of the done news of the week you know wow over two million people you're a dork

40:33.680 --> 40:40.160
over two million people on this mmo you think we might do an expansion or 12 yeah i'll stick

40:40.160 --> 40:46.160
with pso thank you until right mark 2 comes out i'm still curious about wow i i'm i'm just i'm

40:46.160 --> 40:49.600
taking a break from mmo's in general right now i'm kind of burnt on them but i think when i

40:49.600 --> 40:53.640
I come back, I will check out well. I still think you should play PSO with me. I'm on

40:53.640 --> 40:58.040
a break. I'm on a break. I will pay for you a month to play PSO with me. We'll see.

40:58.040 --> 41:01.840
I need people to play with. I can't say anything against free stuff, we'll see. Alright, one

41:01.840 --> 41:08.960
last story for you guys tonight. You know Happy Tree Friends? Yeah, these were the shorts

41:08.960 --> 41:13.700
they used to show at Spike and Mike, Sick and Twisted, where they had these cute, lovable

41:13.700 --> 41:18.560
furry animals and they kill each other senseless. They gouge out eyeballs and all this stuff.

41:18.560 --> 41:23.040
So what more would be perfect for Happy Tree Friends than for them to get their own video

41:23.040 --> 41:24.040
game?

41:24.040 --> 41:25.840
It's happening.

41:25.840 --> 41:30.600
Brad Young, chief executive of Flashman Studios, says it's an almost perfect brand for video

41:30.600 --> 41:31.600
games.

41:31.600 --> 41:36.240
The simple, cute, and hugely appealing graphical style combined with a very dark, clever humor

41:36.240 --> 41:40.880
and the cartoon violence provides a wonderful opportunity for the video games market to

41:40.880 --> 41:44.360
tap into a huge global fan base.

41:44.360 --> 41:46.960
Might I add, I hope this turns out better than Clay Fighters.

41:46.960 --> 41:47.960
That's all.

41:47.960 --> 41:53.320
clay fighters it was all about Helga I thought clay fight a blob it was one of

41:53.320 --> 42:00.920
those one one trick games no it was all about who was this mr. frosty did I love

42:00.920 --> 42:07.820
clay fight because I had Street Fighter 2 which was much better today and I had

42:07.820 --> 42:13.120
play fight it was all about c2 Loki you're awfully quiet but you you were

42:13.120 --> 42:16.640
the first one to show me a DVD full of these things and some of these I

42:16.640 --> 42:20.120
actually cringed at some of these cartoons it takes a lot to gross me out

42:20.120 --> 42:25.240
but some of these are nasty it's just building off the popularity of conquered

42:25.240 --> 42:30.400
live and reloaded it's really all that I seem to recall that g4 was running these

42:30.400 --> 42:35.600

podcast thank you guys for downloading us subscribing we really appreciate you

43:54.120 --> 43:59.400
guys to support final thoughts from those of us in studio Loki that was

43:59.400 --> 44:04.200
funny is this morning there was actually a 4.8 earthquake going on while I was

44:04.200 --> 44:09.900
playing destroy all humans and so so I was sitting there you know playing my

44:09.900 --> 44:13.200
game and all sudden I feel the ground under me roll I'm like damn this is a

44:13.200 --> 44:17.700
realistic game the the earthquake happened while my roommate was playing

44:17.700 --> 44:26.660
DDR and he's a stomper so I just thought it was DDR no I didn't feel anything no

44:26.660 --> 44:31.320
I was upstairs though it's 4.8 earthquake it was in like around Tahoe

44:31.320 --> 44:35.460
our international audience could care less about some little quick. The first

44:35.460 --> 44:41.220
earthquake I ever felt though was in Alabama. A tremor off the coast. Not a state known for their

44:41.220 --> 44:45.180
earthquakes. It was a tremor off coast. Alright, your final thought DarkSakura. My

44:45.180 --> 44:52.680
final thought, reject boss icons because I said so. And my final thought is I want

44:52.680 --> 44:58.680
candy so I'm gonna go get it. I want candy. Thank you guys very much. Have a great week. We'll see

44:58.680 --> 45:13.800
