57062	59103	The Day of Evil because it is the man's birthday.
81670	83431	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
104605	107366	We'll talk about music some other time because tonight we've got to talk about games.
107486	111028	First off, though, I want to give a big thank you to one of the podcast directories out there.
111068	117411	It's PodcastShuffle.com because they made us their podcast of the day, week, moment.
117431	118972	That's one of his favorite podcasts.
119392	119892	Cool.
120852	122873	That makes me all go squeak.
123334	123674	Cool.
123714	124594	Well, we appreciate that.
124654	127335	So check those guys out, PodcastShuffle.com.
127856	129516	And we really appreciate all your guys' support.
129576	131978	The Ferret is so happy that he had a seizure.
132358	132838	Seriously.
135424	136204	Great, good to know.
136725	141627	Alright, let's start off with a little bit of how was your gaming week, the type of stuff you've been playing this week.
141867	143068	We'll start off with Loki tonight.
143148	144669	Loki, what kind of games have you been playing this week?
145109	147790	I played not too much in the realm of games.
147850	154674	I played a little bit of Rengoku, just, you know, killing more stuff on the same level, getting more experience.
155247	158708	Don't beat this stupid game because it's just boring.
158928	161949	It's one of those ones where you're so far into it now you just have to beat the damn thing, right?
162789	165530	Not really, but it's just not that great.
165770	167331	It just doesn't get much harder.
167911	172272	I don't know, the first generation of PSP games just kind of blew.
172432	174193	I don't know why, but... Whoa, whoa, whoa.
174433	175533	Luminous, hello.
176254	181835	Most of the first generation PSP games blew, okay.
181895	183616	Granted, there are some good ones, but...
184411	185832	There's really not too much out there.
185972	187714	Smart Bomb, for example, sucked.
187974	193779	However, my boss gave me a clean copy of it, so I was able to take it back for free, and I still have Smart Bomb.
193819	197081	So, I got all my money back, and I got the game for free, basically.
197482	198002	So, it's nice.
198202	201705	But now I have $90 in credit to GameStop, and I have nothing to buy there.
201725	201705	$90?
201845	202205	Yep.
202265	203666	Dang.
204207	213294	And then, um, also, I played a little bit of the Simpsons arcade game on my meme cabinet, because I had to fire that up to show Nelly's parents what that was.
213534	214155	And then, um,
214878	215599	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
234226	235647	DarkSakra, how was your gaming week?
235667	236447	I played lots and lots of PSO
257794	258554	Blue Burst, correct?
258574	259215	Yes, Blue Burst.
259796	262998	I played some Silent Hill 3 and then turned it off because I was kind of bored.
263059	264400	And I watched Dan beat Fire Emblem.
265361	266081	Which Fire Emblem?
266101	266582	The new game?
266602	267282	The Sacred Stones.
267563	268103	Oh, okay, cool.
268444	269324	Yeah, the one that just came out.
269344	270606	The GameCube one that's not out yet.
271747	272427	Ah, alright.
272667	273028	But, um...
273621	276323	But yeah, I got to see the end of Fire Emblem.
276343	280706	That's like all he plays now is, well, let's put in the Game Boy Advance player and play Fire Emblem.
281126	287491	You know, Fire Emblem was one of those games that was popular in Japan for a long time, but it took a long time to come over here.
287651	289513	Well, you know what they're playing today?
290513	293816	Busted out the Super Nintendo and popped in the Super Famicom card of Fire Emblem 3.
294276	295717	I saw that when I went over there.
295777	300000	I saw that one of your friends was playing like a Japanese game on the Super Nintendo.
300681	302502	This is the kind of stuff I only see happen at your house.
302935	304277	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
324235	334777	But I watched Sega Fantasy 5, which was frustrating because the text would move just fast enough that I would catch words and bits and pieces of Kana and not be able to read the whole thing.
334797	338518	So I was like... That's cool.
338538	339418	I didn't know that existed.
339438	339978	That's kind of funny.
342118	344079	Sega fanboys and fangirls are pretty rabid.
344379	348320	I'll see about posting a link on the OrangeLoungeRadio.com live journal forum.
348680	349120	Very nice.
349560	349880	Nice plug.
350421	355984	Alright, my gaming week, you know, there's not a whole lot of new stuff out there that I really wanted to check out.
356845	368791	I wanted to buy a new DS game this week, but really, all that's out right now, I think the only game that came out was Madagascar, which is a game I might be excited about if I was seven years old, but I'm not, so I could care less.
368911	371473	Didn't Polarium... I played another game, actually.
371573	372273	Okay, what's that?
372333	375034	Lots and lots of the Pac-Pix demo at GameStop.
375515	375875	Alright.
376778	377738	Medios is coming out.
377838	378919	Medios is out June 27th.
379039	382619	It's the day after my birthday and I couldn't be more happier that the DS is getting that.
383900	387140	Sigma Star Saga is coming out, Game Boy Advance, I think.
387280	388781	Or, yeah, I think that's Game Boy Advance.
389541	397502	That one's actually supposed to be pretty interesting because it's, imagine, you know, your typical RPG, but instead of the random battles, it's random side-scroller shooters.
398183	398803	Oh, that's cool.
399463	399663	Huh.
399703	399783	Yeah.
400270	400590	Interesting.
400870	406713	Well, so since I didn't really get anything new, I went back to my collection and I said, well, what are some games I really didn't play enough of?
407074	411336	So I'm checking out Mario DS, Mario 64 DS, because I really didn't get that far into it.
411356	414458	I think I got about 30 stars, and then I said, eh, screw it, I got more games to play.
414838	420561	But I really want more minigames right now, because surprisingly enough, the minigames to me were the best part of Mario DS.
421161	429846	So, and also, I don't know if it's just me, but Mario 64, and I'm going to get a lot of crap and hate letters for this, I think Mario 64 is one of the most overrated games ever.
430373	433355	Because I see a lot of lists out there.
433375	436397	You know how every website out there has got to have a top 100 list.
436817	443561	And Super Mario 64 is always in the top three of the greatest platformers or the greatest games even.
443881	445963	You know, I have to disagree with you.
446303	450145	But I have special memories of Mario 64.
450746	454468	Because Dan and I would play Mario 64 together and bond over it.
455231	457471	Well, yeah, see, you got special stuff there.
458132	461592	Now, add one single word in there, then it makes all the sense in the world.
461672	462853	Mario Kart 64.
463413	464273	That was the game.
464313	465273	That was the game.
465353	465553	I agree.
465573	466973	That game rocked.
467014	469894	Mario 64 for me was nothing but a bunch of frustrating cameras.
470054	470854	I don't know.
470874	474095	I mean, it was darn innovative at the time.
474295	475035	Yeah, I got to give it that.
475075	478836	But I don't know if I would place it so near the top in the great...
479571	480091	Mario Sunshine was cool.
480131	480592	Shine get!
480612	481693	Mario Sunshine to me was not that bad.
481713	482873	I thought it was... It was like Mario 64 with water.
482893	489358	I hate to say it was better than Mario 64, but I was entertained longer by Mario Sunshine than I was in Mario 64 initially.
489378	490659	And honestly, folks, if you have a GameCube,
508427	509208	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
528092	528792	And that's about it.
557765	560266	August is going to be the release date for Geist.
560866	561847	I keep up on that stuff.
562387	566929	Well, I know you got it for your work stuff, but you have to make it sound exciting for our podcast.
566989	567829	It is exciting.
567849	568709	Can you do that for me?
568909	573051	It is exciting because there's not that many good GameCube games coming out.
573929	575731	A little bit of PSP news.
575931	577072	Loki, you'll love this one.
577492	581635	PSP is getting some bonafide actual porn.
582055	583016	I read about that.
583056	583597	That's awesome.
584397	590001	Not somebody putting the porn on their memory sticks, as most PSP users probably did the first day they got it.
590021	590602	UMD porn.
590982	594685	Actual UMD porn coming out in Japan.
594745	602071	And the company that's putting this out is Glaze, G-L-A-Y apostrophe Z, starting off July 8th.
603091	608534	The titles will be anywhere between ¥1,995 and just under ¥4,000.
608754	611515	That's about $18 to $37 US.
612436	617198	Now, I will horribly butcher some of these names if I try to pronounce them.
617218	619179	However, I like some of this.
619219	623422	On July 22nd, Bybody Aeroterrorist Noah.
624662	626243	Aeroterrorist, what is that?
626721	627261	I don't know.
627621	630262	And let's see, HMP Countdown 2005.
630842	632583	Like, humping?
633163	633903	I don't know, HMP.
633943	634684	Hump Countdown!
635564	640706	July 8th, Kanishiro Ana, Koiku Soap Jewel.
641006	642486	I just like that because it has the word soap in it.
643227	645107	Maybe it's like Bubble Bath Babes, the porn.
645207	646167	I don't know.
647208	647568	I can't.
647768	648728	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
670663	672384	Is this something we're going to see in the U.S.?
672484	673905	You know, honestly, probably.
674525	679789	You know who I'd actually see probably putting stuff out for it would be like Playboy, something like that.
680249	683231	We did have a story a couple months ago about Playboy.com doing something.
683251	684732	Yeah, their iPod crap.
685472	688054	Yeah, I mean, honestly, you might see some of that stuff.
688254	692917	I think it'd be better as downloadable content because, honestly, I couldn't see buying.
692997	697900	I mean, really, I just can't see a situation where this would come in handy.
697960	698140	I mean,
699212	700052	Come in handy.
700072	701733	Get it?
702433	703313	Yeah, yeah, whatever.
703353	708435	I just don't see it being something I'd spend money on.
708455	710696	But then again, I don't see myself spending money on UMDs.
711096	713437	And here's a kind of story that ties in there.
713557	714998	I'm not sure if you can cover it.
716658	720360	Actually, we're talking about the first two UMDs actually hit 100,000 in sales.
720380	720920	100,000 units sold.
720940	722620	And the first two would be...
727677	728699	Air Force One took nine months.
744076	744877	and DarkSakura.com
769173	769753	You know what, though?
769774	770574	You know what it reminds me of?
770634	772336	When did DVD players really take off?
772396	773717	When PlayStation 2 came out.
774177	782224	So maybe it's kind of similar, where people don't want to buy portable DVD players, but they'll buy a PSP, which is like a portable DVD player.
782304	782685	I don't know.
782845	783525	I can't explain it.
784086	784626	Hey, whatever.
784646	785127	Yeah, that's cool.
785507	786108	Whatever makes you happy.
786128	787569	DarkSakura, you had a comment?
787709	788930	Porn on the PSP?
789250	790611	Oh, it's going to be really big in Japan.
790772	792073	Here, it's not going to play.
792733	793414	You don't think so, huh?
793574	794495	Yeah, I don't think they're going to do it.
794515	794835	I don't think so.
795262	796923	Age demographic, it's not going to happen.
797083	797463	We'll see.
798763	800144	Also, PSP news.
800184	806866	Now, going along with PSP news in Japan, they're saying it's slumping over in Tokyo, actually, in Japan.
806987	810568	A new story coming out of Tokyo saying that the sales of the PSP are slumping.
811529	828286	from the week of May 23rd to 29th only four PSP games were in the complete top 50 none of them cracking the top 20 whereas you look on the other half of it six Nintendo DS titles in the top 20 Nintendogs
829046	830168	I love the puppies.
830188	831849	I played Frisbee with the puppies.
831869	833591	Is this a sign of things to come?
833611	834833	Is the DS going to...
845768	848571	Outdo the PSP here in America?
848591	850873	Okay, it's America.
851093	852695	We want it bigger, faster.
853055	854417	It needs to do more shit.
854457	857760	It needs to do more Sony because the world sucks the cock of Sony.
859001	862765	There was honestly a big launch of games from the beginning.
863646	865688	They had about 20 or so games.
866969	868931	Now it's dead as far as what's coming out.
869266	870206	And that's what's happening.
870266	871467	It's like there's only a couple games.
871507	874268	People are tired of the old games, and now they're waiting for more stuff.
874448	875848	It's in DS syndrome now.
876028	877048	Exactly what I was thinking.
877309	879249	PSP is now suffering the same thing.
879309	882410	DS is, I would say to most extent, still suffering through.
882910	885271	Both systems, to me, are at a dead still.
885551	889352	We don't have any really great games out on the horizon.
890313	893454	Maybe Meteos on the DS, of course, coming later this month.
893774	894514	That's by the Res guy.
895895	900417	Looking at the PSP calendar, Batman Begins is coming out in June.
900997	904698	Midnight Club 3 Dub Edition, now that could be very cool, also coming out in June.
905059	909080	Currently the only game slated for July, according to the calendar I have here, is Star Wars Episode 3.
909701	912222	So there's really not a whole lot of stuff coming out this summer.
912242	913122	Not necessarily.
913182	914823	Armored Core is going to be coming out.
915083	916404	Armored Core Formula.
917224	917884	Pop Oculus.
918405	923707	And Dead to Rights will be coming out for the PSP as well in July or June, I believe.
924167	925288	Those are going to be coming out.
926089	929994	And I haven't heard anything about Star Wars yet, The Revenge of the Sith.
930014	931075	I think that got pushed back.
931235	931936	And same with...
933568	935389	Oh, Midnight Club 3, I think.
935569	939771	DS, on the other hand, DS is starting to pick up a little steam here.
939831	942473	Now, they've been slumping through the past few months, so they're starting to pick up a little steam.
942513	948576	You've got GoldenEye, Kirby, Canvas Curse, Bomberman, Meteos, Tom Clancy, Splinter Cell all this month.
948776	949576	Nanostray.
949856	950557	It's going to be awesome.
950757	955259	And Nanostray in July, along with Spyro Shadow Legacy also coming out in July.
955619	959101	So you can kind of see that it's starting to pick up a little bit of steam, whereas the PSP is in that...
960345	968267	At least in my opinion, now everybody's got a different opinion, but for me and the games I'm into, PSP's slumping right now, whereas DS is finally starting to pick up steam.
968707	973268	Yeah, but the PSP is going to be getting a lot of play in my house from me when Popokoros comes out.
973988	983211	Aren't you getting sick of this crap, though, where the launches put all their games out for the launch titles and then it's dead for like four months?
983331	986391	I'm honestly kind of looking forward to seeing Sony get screwed over for their arrogance.
986772	987652	That right there, though.
987892	988532	See that right there?
989022	990683	That's what's going to make the revolution rock.
990883	995385	Yeah, if the next-gen systems pull this same crap, it's going to be over for one of them.
995405	1005470	I'm not usually one for resting on your laurels, but Nintendo has always had, even though they haven't been at the top of everything, they've had the staying power.
1005510	1006391	They are stable.
1006811	1015875	See, again, this backs up what I said last week when I said I don't think that it's such a bad thing that revolution wasn't shown at E3 because I think they're taking their sweet-ass time so that they can.
1016776	1017136	Yeah, they can.
1018081	1020402	They're doing it because they can, because they know.
1021082	1023483	They have been a trusted name for how long?
1024643	1025863	Was Sony there in the beginning?
1026364	1028664	No, Sony was the bitch of Nintendo for a while.
1030145	1034066	They did the sound processor for the Super Nintendo, and we're working on the TV system.
1034086	1035366	You're going to get angry emails on that one.
1035606	1036807	It's true.
1036827	1039107	Imagine with me here, just for a second.
1039507	1041308	Here's where Nintendo's going to be revolutionized.
1041328	1042548	DarkSakura's not finished.
1042608	1043609	I still had a rant to go.
1045974	1048636	But Nintendo has been there since the late 80s.
1049096	1058642	There has always been a Nintendo system since, I would say, right after the... I think the Master System was out first.
1059002	1060703	I was just about to ask you, though.
1060863	1062124	Couldn't you say the same thing about Sega?
1062164	1062984	They were there in the beginning, too.
1063004	1063845	Look what happened to them.
1063905	1070229	Yeah, but Sega actually started off doing third-party publishing because I've got some Sega games on my Clicovision.
1071150	1077052	And then they went, and they were pretty strong, but I think that they sort of shot themselves in the foot with the Dreamcast.
1078152	1084694	It was there early, it was out, but they needed to market it a little differently, I think.
1085214	1089695	And then they actually really got fucked over by the fact that Sony said, hey, we're going to jump in the market too.
1090876	1092196	That is what screwed over the Dreamcast.
1092236	1093036	It's a matter of timing.
1094197	1094437	Loki.
1095217	1098518	Anyways, I was going to say, imagine if you will, because this is why the revolution is going to rock.
1099226	1099746	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1123220	1124481	You're going to build Delim to your DS.
1124501	1125902	Put it in sleep mode and take it with you.
1126142	1127182	Interesting thought.
1127323	1127923	Interesting thought.
1127983	1128603	I like that idea.
1128803	1129584	We'll see what happens.
1129904	1130885	Let's move on, though, anyway.
1130905	1132106	We've got a lot of news to get through tonight.
1132646	1133747	Dirge of Cerebrus.
1134107	1135408	Cerebrus?
1135488	1136008	Cerebus.
1136068	1136648	Cerebus.
1137409	1139030	My horrible pronunciation skills coming out.
1139390	1141091	Or as we call it, Vincent May Cry.
1141111	1143833	The Final Fantasy VII sequel.
1145325	1152767	Import Website is up and you get new downloads and you get more information on the story and everything going on.
1152807	1173153	You can check that out at square-enix.co.jp slash games slash ps2 slash dcff7 Now obviously you probably weren't writing that down so just type in square-enix.co.jp You have no idea how big my Vincent fangirlism has been.
1173908	1183753	I had a directory of something like 3,000 doujinshi official art, fan art, pictures of Vincent.
1184374	1185594	And I lost them when my hard drive crashed.
1186315	1187475	Wow.
1187495	1188636	I was a scary fangirl.
1188656	1192158	When I played through Final Fantasy VII the first time, I never got Vincent.
1192816	1194477	GameStop is already taking pre-orders for Halo 3
1216661	1224844	which kind of doesn't surprise me considering every time I buy something at GameStop or really any store these days, they always want me to pre-order something.
1226504	1227305	Would you like to pre-order?
1227325	1227785	It's smart.
1228285	1233327	I understand, but it's just... You know, the thing is, though, is by getting your pre-order in early, you're guaranteed for shipment?
1235367	1241749	I personally don't do it because I'm a very spontaneous person and I like to buy games, just walk in, and I feel like buying this day.
1242170	1243410	I'm not a big pre-order person.
1243430	1243870	I'm really not.
1243910	1246351	And I have never been denied a game I want.
1247642	1248843	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1273393	1273913	So what do you think?
1273973	1274853	Is there any merit to this?
1275013	1276614	I go, no, this is BS.
1276914	1280475	I think it's just a mistake, just like, what was it, they had marijuana.
1280995	1281955	That was exactly what I was going to say.
1281975	1287797	Target.com was selling marijuana at one point, which was some web kid's joke.
1287997	1293698	I don't think you can really trust Walmart.com as your source for gaming.
1293839	1297480	Honestly, I would have heard about it already because it would have been announced.
1297520	1298520	I would have had to put it on my list.
1299320	1302781	But anyways, the thing is for, what was I going to say?
1303359	1306741	Halo 3 is coming out when the PS3 is put out.
1331871	1342100	I will buy the Xbox 360 when Halo 3 is out because there's a better chance that the Xbox 360 might get its first price cut before then in order to entice sales of it.
1342160	1343441	It's not going to matter at my house.
1343481	1344061	We get them all.
1344362	1344722	I know.
1344742	1353069	Speaking of which, since we're talking about stuff in vendors and all that wonderful stuff, PSP, there's rumors about it actually getting a price cut to $200.
1353189	1354630	I've heard about this.
1354770	1357793	And the reason why they are saying that this is going to happen and...
1358649	1362691	Best Buy and EB Games are now stocking the official stuff like the Sony headphones, the little soft case.
1381994	1389781	The 32 meg memory stick card and the battery chargers, they're all sale individually, which this stuff's usually bundled with it.
1390162	1393585	So if there's going to be a non-bundle, then it's going to drop in price.
1394846	1396808	Well, logically, but okay, that's...
1397512	1398333	All good, I guess.
1398413	1404217	But then at the same time, it doesn't make much sense because you have to have a memory stick with a PSP, so you're going to end up buying that separately.
1404557	1407219	You have to have some type of charger, so you're going to end up buying that.
1408159	1413343	Honestly, if I think what's going to happen, though, the charger, I could see maybe a replacement memory stick as a replacement.
1414584	1418306	I think if they were going to do one, it would be just system, memory stick, charger.
1419087	1419747	Well, that's fine.
1420489	1422891	Dark Sakura, what do you have to tell the kids about tonight?
1422911	1425313	Today's bit of advice is how to jump from a bridge or cliff into a river.
1451243	1453224	so that when people tell you to take a flying leap, you'll know what to do.
1454245	1456926	Now, kids, don't really try this at home.
1457847	1458587	We don't want to get sued.
1458727	1461509	Yeah, besides, if you have a cliff or bridge at home, that's just weird.
1462369	1462970	Hey!
1463910	1465171	My advice column, thank you.
1466232	1468413	Number one, jump feet first.
1469153	1471535	Two, keep your body entirely vertical.
1472035	1473556	Three, squeeze your feet together.
1473656	1474937	Belly flop!
1475677	1476077	Rob?
1476778	1477018	Sorry.
1477498	1477878	Thank you.
1478539	1478759	Four,
1479409	1482271	Enter the water feet first, but cleanse your buttocks together.
1483051	1486593	If you do not, water may rush in and cause severe internal damage.
1487454	1488774	My ass exploded.
1490175	1490475	Five.
1491276	1495098	Protect your crotch area by covering it with your hands.
1495838	1498640	Oh my god, can you imagine?
1498780	1499300	Sorry.
1499881	1500181	Six.
1500901	1503683	Immediately after you hit the water, spread your arms and legs wide.
1504023	1507425	Move them back and forth to generate resistance, which will slow your plunge to the bottom.
1508386	1509066	But my, uh...
1509855	1511915	Honest final piece of advice on this.
1514276	1514676	Drown.
1515896	1517476	Also, avoid rocks.
1517616	1519177	That's like the major one right there.
1519957	1523757	If you see rocks poking out of the water, it might not be a good idea to jump towards it.
1527558	1528518	Please don't do that at home.
1528758	1529619	You're not Vin Diesel.
1529639	1531159	You don't need to be jumping off of bridges.
1532399	1532939	Cliff diving?
1534899	1536140	I'll jump off the rainbow bridge.
1537680	1537920	Wow.
1539195	1539736	Wowie wow.
1540236	1542318	Did he remember to tighten his buttocks when he jumped?
1542978	1543839	I'll have to ask him.
1543879	1544860	Yeah, please ask him.
1546201	1546962	Moving on.
1548103	1549144	Gaming companies.
1549304	1556591	I know that most of you guys are located in Silicon Valley, although the rest of you guys are... Some are located elsewhere in the nation, New York, wherever.
1557131	1557412	Louisiana.
1557952	1558673	Louisiana.
1559364	1587129	is trying to get you to move your company over there recently passed Louisiana bill 341 it grants game developers generous tax credits if they relocate to Louisiana it was unanimously passed by the Senate it gives a 10% state tax income credit to studios that spend anywhere between $300,000 and $8 million by setting up shop in Louisiana and then remaining there for one year
1588052	1590394	Do you see game companies rushing to Louisiana?
1590414	1593316	It could happen if they can live through the freaking humidity.
1593536	1598020	That was the first thing I was going to comment on, too, is that, you know... I have been there.
1598260	1604285	Here's one thing that Louisiana, and with all due respect to our listeners in Louisiana, I love you guys for tuning in, but let's think about it.
1604605	1609389	They probably don't have to blow on Nintendo cartridges down there to get them to work anymore because it's so damn humid.
1609689	1611171	No, you just have to deal with them resting.
1612412	1613492	No, no, no, you laugh.
1614233	1615554	No, I laugh because it's true.
1615714	1616435	But it happened.
1618049	1620030	You'd have to clean your contacts with alcohol.
1622092	1625494	For our buddies over in the UK, DarkSakura's got your back.
1625514	1627335	What's going on for the British folk?
1627736	1629497	This is about the Gizmondo.
1630538	1632619	The Gizmondo is put out by a UK company.
1634600	1637883	Actually looking over their stats, it's a pretty, pretty impressive little system.
1637903	1638583	I got to play it.
1638623	1639664	I got to play Johnny Whatever.
1640224	1645688	Sort of like a game where you wail hard on your guitar and then you have like a little karaoke mode that plays sort of like
1647071	1649752	Like Guitar Freaks meets Karaoke Revolution.
1651493	1654414	But basically it's going to be powered by Windows CE.
1654434	1657715	It has a 2.8 inch TFT color screen.
1659156	1666099	It actually supports MPEG-4 movie, multimedia messaging, digital camera, GPRS network.
1667867	1670968	Basically, it's looking like it's trying to really compete with the PSP.
1671509	1673130	Just a run over of some of the features.
1673610	1688398	400 MHz, ARM9 processor, 64-bit graphics processor, 8-way D-pad, left and right triggers, all these bajillion buttons on it, integrated digital camera, 3D game engine.
1689659	1692260	But, DarkSakura, can you play pornography on it?
1693401	1693781	Eventually.
1693921	1695182	MPEG-4 video, come on.
1695882	1697443	It has Windows Media Player 9 on it.
1697803	1698323	Oh, there you go.
1699784	1700864	Polyphonic ringtones.
1700984	1705506	Apparently it's also going to try to kick Nokia back under the grave.
1706466	1707987	Even if they aren't already there.
1708107	1709347	Sorry, but I mean, come on.
1709647	1711168	Yeah, this is like the nail in the coffin.
1711248	1712068	Games coming out.
1712128	1713069	Conflict Vietnam.
1713089	1713749	Carmageddon.
1714309	1715570	Battle Stations Midway.
1716090	1716890	Total Overdose.
1717090	1717430	SSX 3.
1719011	1719831	FIFA Soccer.
1720311	1720932	Sticky Balls.
1721552	1721652	Meh.
1722413	1722894	Rayman.
1723094	1730864	Well, if they relocate to, you know, Louisiana, then that won't be a problem.
1730984	1736110	Also, that game Johnny Whatever, which we have pictures of on orangeelgeradio.com on my E3 gallery.
1736230	1736470	Yes.
1737231	1739374	Any idea for a release date for our British friends?
1739895	1741016	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1756394	1756794	That would be good.
1757755	1760457	If it's a portable system, they don't exactly have to redo the specs.
1760838	1762319	Because that's usually why games take so long.
1762339	1767203	Because they have to go from NTSC to PAL and all that.
1767243	1768344	That's usually why games get delayed.
1768364	1770245	But they won't have to worry about that with Gizmodo.
1770526	1775250	No, and the thing is, it's like the same reason you can play PAL discs on an NTSC on your computer.
1775370	1776371	I mean, it's the same difference.
1778091	1782853	But it really is looking like it's trying to go head-to-head with the PSP.
1783333	1785474	And on top of that, it actually takes flash drive.
1785934	1790395	I actually see it as more, not so much PSP, but more N-Gage, what N-Gage really should have been.
1791695	1793276	It looks like it's trying to bridge the fence.
1793376	1798157	I don't want to have to compare the N-Gage to anything, because nobody is deserving of that kind of punishment.
1798597	1802999	But, you know... But apparently it's being put out by Tiger.
1803019	1803839	Yeah.
1805378	1809220	Tiger used to put out all those little LCD games back in the day.
1810020	1811901	But Tiger's been around for a while.
1812281	1817043	And honestly, I honestly, honestly really think that I'm going to get a Gizmondo.
1817684	1823026	After playing it at E3, and also with just the excellent show they put on, it's looking like it's going to be big.
1823246	1826267	You're not going to get it just because you have every other console system known to man?
1827868	1829309	I am a completion whore.
1829889	1832130	I will just borrow yours when you let me.
1832754	1838202	You know, and honestly though, it actually was pretty comfortable to play You know how some systems just feel kind of out of whack in your hand?
1839272	1840372	I felt pretty comfortable.
1841413	1842233	Do you mean the taco?
1842874	1847315	Gizmondo's going to have to wait in line because I still have to pick up a PSP, but I'm interested in Gizmondo.
1847335	1849736	Why don't they just call it the Magic Taco Gaming System?
1849756	1850697	I think it would sell better.
1850717	1851997	Moving on.
1852157	1852518	Loki.
1852558	1853698	Video taco!
1853718	1855239	We love the taco!
1855259	1858240	Loki, tell us about some hacking and cracking.
1858600	1861221	There's some cool stuff coming out, actually, for the PSP that you can get.
1862102	1863122	One of them is actually this...
1863718	1867059	Group, that's a Spanish electronica group called the Overkillers.
1867479	1872941	And they actually have a download, their whole music album is available now for a free PSP download.
1873181	1874021	And that's kind of cool.
1875041	1883144	So you can get that at, I would say it's probably better to go to PSPHackers.com and then find the link because the website's too long.
1883164	1887725	But anyways, you can get it, it's like a good 63.6 meg download, so check it out.
1888385	1891466	There's some, obviously, they're going emulator crazy on...
1892469	1893049	The PSP, right?
1893069	1894430	That's what I've noticed lately, too.
1894450	1896831	I've seen a lot of gaming blogs over on 1up.com.
1896871	1900372	People are posting pictures of their PSP emulated stuff.
1900392	1905774	I'm almost tempted to go get a 1.0 version PSP, one of the Japanese first ones.
1906914	1913157	But, you know, soon enough, once that 1.5, you know, once they crack that, it's going to be heaven, man.
1913397	1915258	You're going to have all the Game Boy Advance games.
1915638	1919519	They actually have Neo Geo emulated on that, and that's great.
1920059	1921740	So, yeah, definitely, if you've got a
1922273	1928356	If you're lucky enough to have one, the brand new version 1.01, definitely check all this stuff out.
1928396	1929757	Tons of fun stuff for that.
1930217	1942003	Now, if you like more gadgety junk, they've got the PSP Shuffle, where this program you can download, and it'll actually put random content on your PSP, basically.
1942063	1943444	That sounds kind of freaky.
1943624	1944525	It's kind of retarded.
1944545	1944805	Okay.
1946911	1947812	Life is random.
1947892	1949132	Why would you have to buy this program?
1949152	1949692	That's retarded.
1949712	1954453	But anyways, you can buy it if you want to, but honestly, save your time.
1954473	1955914	There are consumer whores out there.
1955954	1960455	I mean, if you want to be random, I'm never having a problem figuring out what I can put on my PSP.
1960475	1963956	If you want to be random, put a dollar in an envelope and send it to me.
1964436	1965756	Honestly, that would be pretty random.
1965896	1967497	And then I would have money.
1968737	1970538	But yeah, that's some cool stuff coming out.
1970598	1972398	Now, I know that there's been some more stuff.
1972538	1975119	I was watching the whole
1975757	1979641	DS Linux, the whole thing going on with that.
1979741	1982283	And they actually have some progress on that, and it looks pretty cool.
1982944	1990771	They've got on themodgods.com, and it's a site that carries a bunch of information about, you know, just, you know, DS hacking.
1990791	1994054	And they actually have DS, or DS... DS!
1995155	1995756	DS!
1995776	1996236	Gotcha!
1996596	1999259	No, dshacker.com they actually released.
1999939	2001080	But they've got a whole thing...
2002113	2012138	They're showing pictures of, I believe it was actually on dshacker.com, pictures of the new version of Linux that's running on the DS.
2012198	2020883	And it actually has a picture of the Linux penguin with the Mario hat on it, which I thought was pretty cute.
2022724	2031289	So it's coming along pretty soon, and you'll be able to actually, you can actually download a copy of it, the Duelist 9 DS emulator.
2033007	2034048	Oh, that's an emulator for DS.
2034128	2035029	Well, check that out too.
2035450	2037693	A bunch of cool stuff.
2038754	2042258	And for my final thing to leave you guys with, actually two things.
2042705	2044366	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2065163	2065643	DJ Ranma S
2095189	2096030	A couple other things.
2096330	2098532	The DS, more colors, pink and red.
2098712	2103756	So now you've got red that's going to be coming out for Jump Superstars, which, I don't know, is another game.
2103776	2104296	Not here in America?
2104576	2105017	No, no, no.
2105057	2105617	Not in Japan.
2105637	2110201	Yeah, I need to import the graphite one, because the graphite one is all shiny black.
2110341	2110521	Wow.
2110881	2119648	So yeah, those are going to be coming out, and definitely check out the brand new screens for the Linux, because it'll be awesome.
2119708	2120068	All right.
2120268	2122150	And yes, DarkSakura, I did say CGA.
2122350	2123791	All its cyan...
2124318	2128341	Magenta, Black, and what's the other one I'm missing?
2129141	2129441	Yellow?
2129541	2130102	No, not Yellow.
2130822	2137486	Actually, Cyan, Magenta, Black, and... No, Cyan, Magenta, Black, because C is Black.
2137786	2139828	I don't know.
2140028	2140368	I don't know.
2140508	2141008	It's four colors.
2141028	2142749	Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow.
2142830	2144511	It was White, Black, Cyan, and Magenta.
2144531	2144851	That's it.
2145171	2145951	God, that's awful.
2145971	2147272	Remember Monochrome Green?
2147813	2148573	How did we live?
2148933	2149253	I don't know.
2149454	2149854	Honestly.
2150390	2151672	Oregon Trail, that's how we made it.
2151772	2153494	Alright, a couple more stories.
2153534	2156298	Let's talk about what's going on in some MMOs worlds right now.
2156679	2159202	Not technically an MMO, okay.
2159282	2161525	Warcraft 3, more of a head-to-head game.
2162046	2162547	Blizzard...
2163493	2169234	closed over 53,000 Battle.net accounts on Warcraft 3.
2170594	2175475	Basically, they were closed because they were hacking or cheating during a multiplayer session.
2176396	2179056	Some of them were just banned for ladder play from a month.
2179136	2180776	Some were permanently removed.
2181216	2181637	Crazy.
2182657	2185877	So, man, don't mess with those Battle.net.
2187418	2189038	Don't mess with your games because they'll get you.
2191029	2197473	and one of the granddad, now this is as old school as MMOs get here, Ultima Online.
2197733	2199734	Do we know anybody that still plays Ultima Online?
2199934	2200154	Yes.
2200474	2202935	Wow, I don't know anybody that still plays this, but that's cool.
2203556	2206737	Ultima Online is getting another expansion.
2206797	2209159	It's called Mondaine's Legacy.
2209479	2211500	You know that game's been out for eight years now?
2211580	2213181	Mondaine or Mundane?
2214301	2215002	Mondaine.
2216421	2216741	I know.
2217002	2217902	You would think after eight years.
2218442	2220343	August 30th is the release of this game.
2220883	2223725	If you want a free trial of Ultima Online, see what you might be missing.
2224125	2225746	Don't make fun until you've played it.
2225986	2226766	I have played it.
2226947	2227507	UO.com.
2227567	2229708	I still know people who are freaking playing Asheron's Call.
2230488	2230788	Why?
2230888	2232029	That's not so surprising.
2232069	2232910	But Ultima Online.
2232930	2239053	The only thing I remember from Ultima Online is just because you can buy your own house.
2239093	2241334	People put their horses in the house so it wouldn't get stolen.
2241574	2241734	Yeah.
2242352	2246955	Meimoto made a very interesting comment this week in an article on CNN Money.
2262635	2264517	There need to be more quick play fun games.
2284795	2311837	but see the thing is with Grand Theft Auto though that is a quick play fun game same with Halo 2 actually because you can go and play multiplayer games it's fun Grand Theft Auto you don't even have to play the game you can just run around and exist in the world and it's fun and that's the whole point that's why I love that game that's why I can take Grand Theft Auto not play it for like a year and come back to it and still have fun in it and just be able to pick it right up again or even just be able to play it for weeks at a time because you can find little fun things to do in it
2312506	2313427	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
2343328	2347070	Nintendo has always had, though, a family-oriented point of view.
2347090	2357975	I mean, we have had the fair share of violent games, but for the most part, Nintendo has been, you know, they have brought out things that are kid-friendly, family-safe, you know, that type of thing.
2358255	2364779	Nintendo only started getting a little more violent with that stuff, though, after they were publicly embarrassed with Mortal Kombat's sweat thing.
2364839	2366640	I mean, that was the laughing stock at the time.
2366980	2367280	Yeah.
2368821	2373145	If you put in the blood code on Mortal Kombat 2, it would change some of the fatalities.
2384060	2389242	on CNET, that the next generation consoles will kill off PC gaming.
2389762	2390183	No.
2390203	2391743	Hold on, hold on, hold on.
2392083	2401507	The bottom line is that console manufacturers often heavily subsidize their new machines, swallowing huge losses up front in hopes that they'll make it all back selling games.
2404788	2413652	Which is to say that once the 18-34 demographic starts buying $400 PS3s instead of $400 video cards, developers may have no choice but to follow suit.
2414491	2414751	Agree?
2414791	2415152	Disagree?
2416293	2423498	Nah, the PC market is still going to go... And honestly, I really think that the whole PC gaming market is going to be dominated by the MMO.
2424759	2433767	The more of them that come out, the more addicts there are going to be, and the more people who are going to upgrade their machine... Even I bought a new graphics card so I could play Final Fantasy XI.
2435328	2437630	And now it makes PSO look so beautiful.
2437810	2440212	But, you know, still...
2442118	2445900	You can already play Final Fantasy XI on a console, and then Xbox 360 is going to get it too.
2445960	2448021	But it looks like shit on the console.
2448181	2450982	Well, the Xbox 360 is going to be nice, you've got to give it that.
2451982	2455464	Yeah, but you can still always build a PC that's going to kick its ass.
2456844	2464608	I just think that as the consoles evolve, the PCs evolve too, so I think they'll always be a place for PC games.
2464728	2465628	I mean, I don't know.
2466357	2486677	you pull your console out of the box six weeks later your computer technology is going to make it obsolete it's already obsolete you can build computers that use the cell structure processors they have them they've been having them they've been out for what a year now the cell processors
2488328	2493351	Yeah, they've been marketing them for all kinds of science research.
2493651	2502055	I think what the article tries to say is that this kind of stuff is too expensive for most of us, but the game consoles make them affordable, I think, in a weird way.
2502075	2512561	Well, yeah, you buy the package deal, but there are still going to be the hardcore PC people who are going to keep it alive, and the fact that the pieces are so expensive, it's just more fuel.
2513194	2517817	and just right now, you can't play Xbox Live and be on IRC at the same time.
2518717	2518978	Nope.
2519538	2522700	I cannot do my homework playing PSO on the Xbox.
2522740	2527383	Now, who's to say that that won't change in the future with what all these next-gen systems want to do, but I don't know.
2527463	2528443	Loki, you have another thought on this?
2528503	2534607	It's never going to kill it off, because if you're spending $400 on a graphics card, you're a special kind of crazy anyway, so it's not going to matter.
2535171	2538193	I mean, honestly, who spends $400 on a graphics card?
2538273	2543096	I mean... You know, if you're gonna spend that kind of money buying Alienware... Ooh, ooh, ooh, big man, buy a high-end graphics card.
2543136	2543516	Guess what?
2543616	2545257	Next week it's obsolete!
2545878	2549000	And my $20, you know, graphics card's still, you know, whatever.
2549340	2553122	But the whole thing is, is you really don't need to spend all this money on console games.
2553203	2557045	People that are playing console games are gonna still be playing console games, and people that are playing the
2557831	2558312	PC games.
2558332	2564961	You know what, because the PCs now, they're still going to get better, the graphics are going to get better, and it's still going to be one step ahead of the console systems.
2564981	2566944	The console systems will get closer, but whatever.
2568065	2568826	I'd play all of them.
2569207	2569607	I don't care.
2570108	2570568	I've got them.
2570628	2570969	I play them.
2572073	2574175	But you're also a special kind of crazy, DarkSakura.
2574195	2575816	That's why we love you.
2576136	2589586	Okay, emulators are one thing, but I have to have the stupid half-broken joystick in my hand so I can play kicks on my Atari 5200 and play it right, goddammit.
2589926	2591567	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2613795	2614455	Oh, very cool.
2614695	2618856	It's definitely very first-person shooter-y, but they got them looking right.
2619336	2620937	And you know, though, a bit of trivia.
2621777	2623517	You know Richard Dean Anderson was MacGyver.
2624758	2625058	Oh, yeah.
2625298	2625578	Oh, yeah.
2626078	2630699	But dude was also in a few episodes of MacGyver, too.
2631519	2634800	July is the release date for that game, so you kids look for it.
2635280	2638581	That's going to bring another edition of Orange Lounge Radio to go to a close.
2638641	2639501	Final thoughts, Loki?
2640841	2642263	I have my headache still.
2642543	2643544	It needs to go away.
2644585	2647207	And I loaned out Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
2647287	2648148	What was I thinking?
2649589	2650109	DarkSakura.
2651010	2653833	Reject false icons and happy birthday to the old man.
2656415	2661459	And my final thought is my birthday is coming up very soon and I hope you're all going to get me something lovely.
2662140	2663301	My second final thought is
2664585	2668987	Vote for us on Podcast Alley.
2669247	2671729	Go there now.
2672049	2673029	Don't hesitate.

2673830	2675791	Because if you vote us, we get better.
2676191	2678752	Don't you feel like it's running for student council, though?
2678892	2679593	No, no, no.
2679613	2684735	They need to vote for us so that my ego can inflate to astronomical proportions.
2684835	2685435	Need to go now.
2685475	2686436	Podcast Alley.
2687003	2688203	Honestly, go vote for us.

2690124	2690924	Don't just vote once.
2691044	2691644	Vote every month.

2697866	2698726	Vote or die.
2698746	2699466	Vote or die!
2699486	2703307	I was just going to say, as P. Diddy says, vote or die.
2704447	2704847	All right.
2704867	2705967	Have a good one, you guys.
2705987	2708188	We'll see you next time on the Orange Lounge Radio Deco Edition.
