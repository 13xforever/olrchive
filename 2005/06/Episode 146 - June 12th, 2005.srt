48
00:08:27,405 --> 00:08:28,566
[SPEAKER_22]: Someone keyed my new car.

49
00:08:29,787 --> 00:08:30,207
[SPEAKER_22]: What?

50
00:08:31,108 --> 00:08:34,871
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I don't know if it's already there, but it's very hard to tell because my car is silver.

51
00:08:35,351 --> 00:08:35,491
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-huh.

52
00:08:35,692 --> 00:08:38,194
[SPEAKER_22]: So it doesn't show up as glaringly as it would on any other color.

53
00:08:38,814 --> 00:08:39,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh.

54
00:08:39,174 --> 00:08:42,958
[SPEAKER_22]: But I noticed it, I was like, the light is reflecting in a funny way.

55
00:08:42,978 --> 00:08:43,298
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh-huh.

56
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:54,361
[SPEAKER_22]: I got your car, and my car kicks everybody's ass twice, and several times on Sunday, and then, like, just fucks all that shit up.

57
00:08:55,883 --> 00:08:57,745
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm sure we'll be hearing more about that later.

58
00:08:57,825 --> 00:09:00,628
[SPEAKER_11]: Also joining us tonight, say hello to TechMassaLoki.

59
00:09:00,648 --> 00:09:01,890
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

60
00:09:03,391 --> 00:09:04,712
[SPEAKER_11]: I finished my pizza.

61
00:09:04,932 --> 00:09:06,293
[SPEAKER_11]: You finished your pizza and breadsticks tonight.

62
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:09,094
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry about the little hiccup there in the beginning, boys and girls.

63
00:09:09,655 --> 00:09:15,718
[SPEAKER_11]: We accidentally had a router mishap, and so something came unplugged during the intro there.

64
00:09:15,738 --> 00:09:16,638
[SPEAKER_11]: We cut the wrong wire.

65
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:26,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, basically, we accidentally cut the wire that would blow everything up, because you know how in the movies... It's like you press the red button in Maniac Mansion in the pool.

66
00:09:28,812 --> 00:09:33,255
[SPEAKER_11]: Or for those that didn't play through that game, which would be a lot of our audience, because that game is kind of old.

67
00:09:33,455 --> 00:09:40,599
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd always get just fed up and purposefully find the pool, drain it, because the pool cooled the nuclear reactor, and pressing the button made it explode.

68
00:09:40,619 --> 00:09:45,142
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish they would release that TV show on DVD or something, because I totally miss the TV show.

69
00:09:45,402 --> 00:09:46,703
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, anyway, my analogy.

70
00:09:46,983 --> 00:09:52,767
[SPEAKER_11]: You know how in the movies they always have the green wire and the red wire, and you have to cut the right wire or everything will blow up?

71
00:09:53,227 --> 00:09:56,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we accidentally cut the wire that blew everything up, so...

72
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:25,704
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, anyway Moving on We are back, hello We got a fun show for you guys tonight We even have a very special guest here tonight But he'll introduce himself after the first break Because we don't have all our listeners back yet We had a mishap Yeah, so we'll be back So let's go to a break and when we come back we'll get to the show As I mentioned in the opening there We are going to debut an Ultramix 3 song A brand new song here on the show

73
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:27,166
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's cool.

74
00:10:27,506 --> 00:10:31,691
[SPEAKER_11]: And the thing is, is that it's already been out there on the internet, just nobody found it yet.

75
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:32,292
[SPEAKER_11]: But we did.

76
00:10:32,712 --> 00:10:35,435
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to unveil it for the rest of you guys.

77
00:10:35,475 --> 00:10:41,001
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to point at the pink elephant in the room tonight and say, look, Ultramix 3 song, right over there.

78
00:10:41,201 --> 00:10:43,804
[SPEAKER_07]: There'll be also some more crapper debuting, too.

79
00:10:44,245 --> 00:10:44,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Like what?

80
00:10:45,206 --> 00:10:45,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Well...

81
00:10:46,061 --> 00:10:47,922
[SPEAKER_07]: What's it say on the CD here?

82
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:51,363
[SPEAKER_07]: There's two songs on there, and what are they... Interesting.

83
00:10:51,863 --> 00:10:53,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I supposed to say now or later?

84
00:10:53,423 --> 00:11:03,647
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll say it later, but there's two songs on there that have remixes to them now, and they're okay, but they'll never be released on the internet because they're B-sides.

85
00:11:03,847 --> 00:11:05,747
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so tonight's the only time you'll hear them then?

86
00:11:05,967 --> 00:11:06,448
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, maybe.

87
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:06,988
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

88
00:11:07,907 --> 00:11:09,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go into this break.

89
00:11:09,047 --> 00:11:12,308
[SPEAKER_11]: In this first break, we're going to hear some music from DDR Ultramix 2.

90
00:11:12,948 --> 00:11:18,729
[SPEAKER_11]: Starting off with a song we were the first to blow the lid off of last year, about a year ago this time, so here it is.

91
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:25,371
[SPEAKER_11]: For those of you guys that are trying to get your friends in to listen, because we are going to be announcing that new song and playing the new song, we have it.

92
00:11:25,691 --> 00:11:28,071
[SPEAKER_11]: We found a copy of it out there, so we're going to play the new song for you guys.

93
00:11:28,451 --> 00:11:30,132
[SPEAKER_11]: That should be about 7.45, 8 o'clock-ish.

94
00:11:32,532 --> 00:11:33,052
[SPEAKER_11]: Just so you know.

95
00:11:33,113 --> 00:11:35,595
[SPEAKER_11]: But don't just tune out and then tune back in then.

96
00:11:35,615 --> 00:11:38,437
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we've got loads of fun for you guys tonight.

97
00:11:38,517 --> 00:11:41,739
[SPEAKER_11]: Cage match and stuff going on within the groove as well.

98
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,002
[SPEAKER_11]: And all the stuff you know and love here at Orange Lounge Radio.

99
00:11:45,022 --> 00:11:46,043
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll be back after this.

100
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:27,898
[SPEAKER_20]: Tone poem dreams, alpha perfection, so very hard to reach Harmony machine, tormenting the sensory Deliciously evolved, and yet nobody knows Tittle tattle, chicken chat, shoots in the breeze Platter, clack, hate and splatter, there's a vagraness in me

101

108
00:19:33,635 --> 00:19:37,797
[SPEAKER_11]: with some stuff going on there in the opening where we kind of disconnected there for a little bit.

109
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,538
[SPEAKER_11]: And now folks in the chatroom are saying they heard skips there in the last break.

110
00:19:41,758 --> 00:19:42,859
[SPEAKER_11]: I have no idea what that's about.

111
00:19:42,939 --> 00:19:46,700
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't show anything going on on our end, but I have no idea.

112
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,861
[SPEAKER_11]: So hopefully everything's okay.

113
00:19:50,842 --> 00:19:54,623
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, tonight we are going to play a brand new song from Ultramix 3 for you guys.

114
00:19:55,623 --> 00:20:00,425
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably in about... I don't know, probably about a little over an hour from now.

115
00:20:01,626 --> 00:20:02,246

117
00:20:25,794 --> 00:20:27,537
[SPEAKER_11]: So back at the old Konami now?

118
00:20:27,737 --> 00:20:28,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

119
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,680
[SPEAKER_11]: How's it going?

120
00:20:30,101 --> 00:20:30,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty good.

121
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's all I can say about that.

122
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:35,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.

123
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,874
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't really say anything, can you?

124
00:20:38,114 --> 00:20:39,156
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I can't.

125
00:20:39,456 --> 00:20:39,997
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a bummer.

126
00:20:40,714 --> 00:20:44,515
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you gotten to at least see the new stuff that we're all excited about?

127
00:20:44,795 --> 00:20:45,355
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

128
00:20:45,455 --> 00:20:47,016
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little thing called NDA.

129
00:20:47,356 --> 00:20:48,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, you can't even say that.

130
00:20:48,576 --> 00:20:49,776
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think I can say that.

131
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,077
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well, that's too bad.

132
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,057
[SPEAKER_11]: Which means that's a... What?

133
00:20:54,658 --> 00:20:55,958
[SPEAKER_07]: That means yes, he has.

134
00:20:56,598 --> 00:20:58,078
[SPEAKER_07]: That's exactly what that means.

135
00:20:58,138 --> 00:20:58,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that no meaning yes?

136
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:03,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it would have been a no, otherwise, not, I can't talk about that.

137
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:07,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, let's use some reverse psychology to figure out some more stuff here.

138
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:10,122
[SPEAKER_06]: So every time I answer NDA, that means yes?

139
00:21:15,985 --> 00:21:19,306
[SPEAKER_11]: Was somebody smoking crack when they put Butterfly on Ultramix 3?

140
00:21:20,727 --> 00:21:21,267
[SPEAKER_11]: NDA.

141
00:21:22,328 --> 00:21:23,328
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, just curious.

142
00:21:24,669 --> 00:21:30,912
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, also I have to point out is that because we are disclosing a new song tonight,

143
00:21:31,252 --> 00:21:35,436
[SPEAKER_11]: This has nothing to do with the coincidence that Miklatov is here because he is under an NDA.

144
00:21:35,576 --> 00:21:39,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I didn't know about this until yesterday that you even knew about the song.

145
00:21:39,819 --> 00:21:40,740
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

146
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:48,866
[SPEAKER_11]: As you will find out when we reveal the song, you'll find out why we're revealing the song and it will make sense how all the cards kind of fell into place.

147
00:21:48,927 --> 00:21:50,748
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll kind of get to that when we talk about the song.

148
00:21:51,288 --> 00:21:52,069
[SPEAKER_11]: GamePro again!

149
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:57,013
[SPEAKER_11]: It actually was not GamePro, funny enough, but it was an internet website that spilled it.

150
00:21:57,153 --> 00:21:57,914
[SPEAKER_11]: I will say that much.

151
00:21:59,658 --> 00:22:04,600
[SPEAKER_06]: And it wasn't a DDR-related website, so it's just... It's a website.

152
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,221
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a website.

153
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:06,841
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, so we'll get to that a little later.

154
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:13,304
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to get to that, but first we've got to start off the show with a little bit of how was your week, how was your day?

155
00:22:13,564 --> 00:22:17,206
[SPEAKER_11]: And DarkSakura, I know you're dying to tell us all about the new vehicle.

156
00:22:17,226 --> 00:22:18,567
[SPEAKER_11]: So how was your week, how was your day?

157
00:22:18,707 --> 00:22:20,688
[SPEAKER_22]: The rest of my week I could give a rat's ass about.

158
00:22:22,168 --> 00:22:27,251
[SPEAKER_22]: We went on Friday to one of the Mitsubishi dealerships in town because I had settled on getting a Lancer.

159
00:22:28,471 --> 00:22:52,996
[SPEAKER_22]: and they gave us a good deal on a not too exciting 2004, you know, it only had like 5,000 miles on it, so it was really good, it had all the options, everything else, like, okay, this is nice, and then we went to Fairfield, and they had a 2002 Lancer OZ Rally Edition, which is what I wanted, and the thing about it is that this

160
00:22:54,995 --> 00:23:18,776
[SPEAKER_22]: has, is basically, when I think Lancer, this is the car I think of, it has the logo and wide letters across the back instead of just eensy tiny at the bottom of the trunk, and has the, the, you know, the custom rims for the, for that model, has all the bells and whistles, it's automatic on top of it, we did look at an evolution, and there's no way I could ever fucking afford that car.

161
00:23:19,977 --> 00:23:26,600
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, I also got a warranty on it that's basically the warranty for a brand new car on a 2002 model.

162
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,901
[SPEAKER_22]: So basically, I have an old car with a brand new warranty on it.

163
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:31,962
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's fabulous.

164
00:23:32,022 --> 00:23:32,562
[SPEAKER_22]: It's silver.

165
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:36,284
[SPEAKER_22]: It only has a little ding on the fender, and then I found the scratch on the door.

166
00:23:37,284 --> 00:23:38,105
[SPEAKER_22]: But it's fast.

167
00:23:39,165 --> 00:23:43,667
[SPEAKER_22]: It goes from zero to 60 in less than three seconds.

168
00:23:43,707 --> 00:23:45,388
[SPEAKER_22]: How fast have you taken it so far?

169
00:23:46,308 --> 00:23:47,108
[SPEAKER_22]: Ben took it to 95.

170
00:23:50,225 --> 00:23:52,867
[SPEAKER_22]: He got challenged on Roosevelt Road driving my car last night.

171
00:23:53,107 --> 00:23:53,648
[SPEAKER_11]: To a race?

172
00:23:53,908 --> 00:23:54,568
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, to a race.

173
00:23:55,049 --> 00:23:58,351
[SPEAKER_22]: He passed some Civic, and he just swooped right down in front of him.

174
00:23:58,811 --> 00:24:01,733
[SPEAKER_22]: And so the guy in the Civic started flashing his lights like he wanted to race.

175
00:24:02,554 --> 00:24:03,874
[SPEAKER_22]: And then pulled up in the lane beside him.

176
00:24:05,456 --> 00:24:08,558
[SPEAKER_22]: Dan said he might have done it, but I would have had his balls for breakfast.

177
00:24:09,499 --> 00:24:11,040
[SPEAKER_22]: Or at least would have fed it to him for breakfast.

178
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:13,022
[SPEAKER_10]: So, good boy.

179
00:24:13,162 --> 00:24:15,104
[SPEAKER_10]: Tie the car around a tree the first day out.

180
00:24:15,144 --> 00:24:15,925
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a great idea.

181
00:24:15,985 --> 00:24:21,409
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, especially since from that area, Roosevelt Road goes to one lane.

182
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,471
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, not smart.

183
00:24:26,254 --> 00:24:27,315
[SPEAKER_22]: My week has been car.

184
00:24:28,075 --> 00:24:28,936
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh yeah, and I got an iPod.

185
00:24:29,456 --> 00:24:29,837
[SPEAKER_22]: It was free.

186
00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:32,911
[SPEAKER_11]: So the free iPod site actually worked?

187
00:24:33,231 --> 00:24:33,511
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

188
00:24:33,591 --> 00:24:36,553
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there an engraving on the thing that says freeipods.com or whatever?

189
00:24:36,693 --> 00:24:37,854
[SPEAKER_22]: No, it's just an iPod.

190
00:24:38,154 --> 00:24:38,554
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

191
00:24:38,754 --> 00:24:39,255
[SPEAKER_11]: How many gigs?

192
00:24:40,055 --> 00:24:39,255
20.

193
00:24:40,555 --> 00:24:40,896
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

194
00:24:41,116 --> 00:24:42,136
[SPEAKER_22]: And in FM tuner now.

195
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:43,497
[SPEAKER_11]: How much have you filled it up already?

196
00:24:44,037 --> 00:24:44,238
[SPEAKER_22]: About 10.

197
00:24:45,649 --> 00:24:53,120
[SPEAKER_22]: And I have a 28 gigabyte collection, so I was taking off all the stuff that I never listen to but play for other people.

198
00:24:54,062 --> 00:24:54,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Right on.

199
00:24:54,502 --> 00:24:57,166
[SPEAKER_22]: Like, none of my Bimani music is in it except for all my Taku stuff.

200
00:24:57,207 --> 00:24:57,827
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what's interesting?

201
00:24:57,888 --> 00:24:59,550
[SPEAKER_11]: None of my Bimani music is in my iPod either.

202
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,253
[SPEAKER_22]: I have some of the long versions.

203
00:25:02,074 --> 00:25:02,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, me too.

204
00:25:02,714 --> 00:25:04,315
[SPEAKER_11]: I have, like, some long versions.

205
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:07,656
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I have Conga Feelin' in there, because you have to have Conga Feelin', obviously.

206
00:25:08,876 --> 00:25:09,516
[SPEAKER_11]: And very few others.

207
00:25:09,556 --> 00:25:14,237
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a couple Loki remixes, funny enough, which are, you know, somewhat Bomani-related, I suppose.

208
00:25:14,477 --> 00:25:18,998
[SPEAKER_22]: Celica only goes to 101.

209
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:21,959
[SPEAKER_22]: He only took the car that fast just because of the road.

210
00:25:22,459 --> 00:25:23,540
[SPEAKER_22]: My car will top out at 100.

211
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,541
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, the guy at the dealership said he got it going at 130.

212
00:25:29,577 --> 00:25:30,317
[SPEAKER_22]: and still had room.

213
00:25:31,598 --> 00:25:33,859
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm just making a promise in the chat room.

214
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:34,560
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting comment.

215
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,822
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of our chat room, why don't you join at www.orangelandredo.com.

216
00:25:37,862 --> 00:25:38,482
[SPEAKER_11]: Click on chat.

217
00:25:38,502 --> 00:25:39,943
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got a lot of interesting folks in there.

218
00:25:40,943 --> 00:25:44,465
[SPEAKER_11]: Sephiroth1215 says, I'm thinking about doing the free Xbox 360.

219
00:25:44,525 --> 00:25:46,346
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you think about that?

220
00:25:46,426 --> 00:25:53,210
[SPEAKER_11]: Now that you have reaped the rewards of one of these free iPod.com sites, what do you think of other free stuff?

221
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:56,052
[SPEAKER_22]: First of all, the Xbox 360 isn't going to be out for months.

222
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:02,764
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why I think it's weird that there's already all these banner ads for win a free PlayStation 3.

223
00:26:03,404 --> 00:26:06,567
[SPEAKER_22]: The thing is, look at what type of offers they have.

224
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:11,632
[SPEAKER_22]: I did the Blockbuster one because you have to sign up for an offer and you have to get five more people to do it.

225
00:26:12,172 --> 00:26:13,613
[SPEAKER_22]: I signed up for the Blockbuster one.

226
00:26:14,594 --> 00:26:16,756
[SPEAKER_22]: It had a two week trial on it.

227
00:26:17,016 --> 00:26:18,558
[SPEAKER_22]: It takes them five days.

228
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:24,840
[SPEAKER_22]: To confirm, they do not bill you until your free trial is up, and you can cancel within your free trial.

229
00:26:25,801 --> 00:26:28,102
[SPEAKER_22]: So I waited until it confirmed, and I canceled it.

230
00:26:29,063 --> 00:26:29,763
[SPEAKER_22]: No money lost.

231
00:26:30,704 --> 00:26:32,505
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what a lot of people do.

232
00:26:32,645 --> 00:26:35,086
[SPEAKER_11]: So people wonder how do they make money off this.

233
00:26:35,186 --> 00:26:41,110
[SPEAKER_22]: Keep in mind as well that you're putting a lot of your shipping, your address, all that stuff on those sites that you're doing the offers for.

234
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:43,031
[SPEAKER_22]: They will sell your information.

235
00:26:43,496 --> 00:26:44,657
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, absolutely.

236
00:26:44,857 --> 00:26:47,238
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I actually got, and they'll spam your email box.

237
00:26:47,818 --> 00:26:52,121
[SPEAKER_22]: So you have to, you know, basically get their physical address and send them an affidavit.

238
00:26:52,221 --> 00:26:54,422
[SPEAKER_22]: Do not sell my information.

239
00:26:54,582 --> 00:26:55,543
[SPEAKER_22]: Opt out of any sharing.

240
00:26:55,563 --> 00:26:57,184
[SPEAKER_22]: Because under privacy law, they have to do it.

241
00:26:57,624 --> 00:26:57,824
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

242
00:26:58,484 --> 00:27:02,547
[SPEAKER_11]: But, or just move on them, which is something you're going to be doing soon anyway, right?

243
00:27:02,567 --> 00:27:03,207
[SPEAKER_22]: Boarding addresses.

244
00:27:04,348 --> 00:27:05,028
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I guess that's true.

245
00:27:05,822 --> 00:27:06,822
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, the junk mail finds you.

246
00:27:07,683 --> 00:27:14,225
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a way that when you put out your forwarding address, except for iPodFreeStuff.com or whatever site you use?

247
00:27:14,865 --> 00:27:14,985
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

248
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:15,625
[SPEAKER_11]: That's too bad.

249
00:27:16,346 --> 00:27:21,247
[SPEAKER_22]: Although what I do want to do is take the junk mail one day and just put a big return to sender stamp on it.

250
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:24,288
[SPEAKER_22]: Does it really work?

251
00:27:25,189 --> 00:27:25,929
[SPEAKER_22]: I haven't tried it yet.

252
00:27:26,669 --> 00:27:31,971
[SPEAKER_22]: Or, one thing, there's free offer things, you know, sign up for this credit card.

253
00:27:32,731 --> 00:27:36,212
[SPEAKER_22]: I used to chop up their offer and put it in the envelope and mail it back to them.

254
00:27:38,873 --> 00:27:39,493
[SPEAKER_11]: That's great.

255
00:27:40,414 --> 00:27:41,234
[SPEAKER_11]: Do they still send them to you?

256
00:27:41,816 --> 00:27:44,298
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to write deceased on mine.

257
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:46,760
[SPEAKER_07]: You used to write what?

258
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Deceased.

259
00:27:50,403 --> 00:27:51,704
[SPEAKER_11]: I stopped getting those offers.

260
00:27:52,524 --> 00:27:56,567
[SPEAKER_11]: I used to send them fingers, but then they started showing up in chili bowls, so I had to stop doing that.

261
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:00,230
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not paid to be funny.

262
00:28:00,951 --> 00:28:02,112
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything else you want to share about your week?

263
00:28:02,712 --> 00:28:03,773
[SPEAKER_22]: You're not paid at all.

264
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:05,704
[SPEAKER_11]: We do this out of love and ego

265
00:28:32,156 --> 00:28:36,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, aren't you worried about the Miklatov fan club like assaulting you at SVGL now that you've said that?

266
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,801
[SPEAKER_06]: No, because I don't have a fan club.

267
00:28:40,442 --> 00:28:41,863
[SPEAKER_06]: I have haters.

268
00:28:42,523 --> 00:28:43,264
[SPEAKER_11]: You have haters?

269
00:28:43,324 --> 00:28:43,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

270
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:44,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Why do you have haters?

271
00:28:44,605 --> 00:28:45,225
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I'm a jerk.

272
00:28:45,605 --> 00:28:46,446
[SPEAKER_11]: You're a jerk.

273
00:28:46,706 --> 00:28:48,307
[SPEAKER_11]: You are, but I mean, you know.

274
00:28:49,648 --> 00:28:53,531
[SPEAKER_06]: People still bring up the whole last year with the extreme thread how...

275
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,746
[SPEAKER_06]: We gave them not real clues.

276
00:28:56,766 --> 00:28:57,367
[SPEAKER_06]: But that was funny.

277
00:28:59,147 --> 00:29:02,589
[SPEAKER_11]: Which would be even funnier if you guys don't give them any clues this year.

278
00:29:02,649 --> 00:29:03,970
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be hilarious.

279
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,891
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be hilarious.

280
00:29:06,471 --> 00:29:06,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

281
00:29:06,891 --> 00:29:08,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I just said that.

282
00:29:08,132 --> 00:29:08,692
[SPEAKER_06]: That was my week.

283
00:29:08,912 --> 00:29:11,353
[SPEAKER_06]: And then yesterday I got really drunk.

284
00:29:11,973 --> 00:29:13,274
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was on the floor a lot.

285
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:13,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Were you dunked?

286
00:29:14,615 --> 00:29:15,735
[SPEAKER_06]: I was so dunked.

287
00:29:16,155 --> 00:29:18,176
[SPEAKER_06]: At one point I think I asked if I was black.

288
00:29:20,983 --> 00:29:23,859
[SPEAKER_11]: For the record, boys and girls, Mikhail Tav is not black.

289
00:29:24,936 --> 00:29:31,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, and I was on the floor a whole lot, and played drinking games, and it was fun.

290
00:29:31,918 --> 00:29:34,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Except for the pain of my stomach with the alcohol.

291
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:38,741
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, yeah, I haven't done much.

292
00:29:40,081 --> 00:29:42,542
[SPEAKER_06]: I kinda, oh, I picked up a Blue DS!

293
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:44,223
[SPEAKER_06]: That's hot, because it's blue.

294
00:29:45,163 --> 00:29:47,824
[SPEAKER_06]: And now I have to get Nintendogs for it, because Nintendogs is fun.

295
00:29:47,844 --> 00:29:48,784
[SPEAKER_11]: Because of the puppies!

296
00:29:48,884 --> 00:29:49,284
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

297
00:29:49,304 --> 00:29:51,025
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to tell the ball story, though.

298
00:29:52,076 --> 00:29:54,738
[SPEAKER_11]: because I got so much exercise in the mall today because of you.

299
00:29:54,838 --> 00:29:55,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

300
00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:00,063
[SPEAKER_06]: So EB has this promotion going on where you buy a DS and get Mario free.

301
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:04,307
[SPEAKER_06]: So we went to EB in the mall, which was on the other side of the mall from where we parked.

302
00:30:05,028 --> 00:30:07,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Get there, I'm like, hey, I want a blue DS with free Mario.

303
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,391
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't have Mario.

304
00:30:09,852 --> 00:30:11,774
[SPEAKER_06]: I was kind of sad, and I was like, okay, I'll just buy it.

305
00:30:12,274 --> 00:30:16,218
[SPEAKER_06]: So I take an ad just because I wanted to look at it, and I bought the DS.

306
00:30:16,818 --> 00:30:19,060
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, maybe GameStop will match the ad.

307
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,441
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's on the other side of the mall.

308
00:30:20,521 --> 00:30:22,002
[SPEAKER_06]: So we go to the other side of the mall.

309
00:30:22,382 --> 00:30:24,023
[SPEAKER_06]: I still have my blue DS from EB.

310
00:30:24,143 --> 00:30:24,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Go in there.

311
00:30:25,364 --> 00:30:27,986
[SPEAKER_06]: I ask if they will match the ad.

312
00:30:28,006 --> 00:30:30,408
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like, yeah, if you have the ad with you, which I did.

313
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:35,512
[SPEAKER_06]: But I had this blue DS that I had to go take back to EB first to get the money back for.

314
00:30:36,312 --> 00:30:43,358
[SPEAKER_06]: So we walked to the other side of the mall again to EB, talked to the guy, tell him that I want my free games, so I'm going to go to GameStop.

315
00:30:43,378 --> 00:30:44,159
[SPEAKER_06]: He was cool about it.

316
00:30:44,499 --> 00:30:50,144
[SPEAKER_06]: And we walked to the other side of the mall, to GameStop, to get my Blue DS and my free Mario.

317
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:56,089
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I wanted a USB cable as well, but they were all $15, and they came with software I didn't need.

318
00:30:56,349 --> 00:31:00,753
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have one back in Kansas that's like a $5 one, but it's back in Kansas.

319
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:03,535
[SPEAKER_22]: I could have given you one for free.

320
00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:05,712
[SPEAKER_06]: I got one for free now.

321
00:31:07,538 --> 00:31:09,384
[SPEAKER_06]: That was it.

322
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:13,692
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, yeah, I got a lot of exercise in the mall today, thanks.

323
00:31:13,792 --> 00:31:16,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and there are these little skanks that were performing.

324
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:18,156
[SPEAKER_06]: They were seven years old.

325
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:21,839
[SPEAKER_06]: They looked like they were performing to become future strippers, is what it was.

326
00:31:22,479 --> 00:31:23,140
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was great.

327
00:31:24,161 --> 00:31:26,002
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a lot of pedophiles there, you could tell.

328
00:31:26,723 --> 00:31:34,089
[SPEAKER_11]: What was great is at the mall here, they have one of those local news stations that does their live broadcast from the mall or whatever.

329
00:31:34,169 --> 00:31:39,894
[SPEAKER_11]: So right next to that is one of those stores where little girls can go and buy accessories.

330
00:31:40,216 --> 00:31:42,200
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, it's not Claire's, but it's some other store.

331
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,663
[SPEAKER_11]: They learn how to make jewelry and stuff.

332
00:31:44,404 --> 00:31:48,933
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, like, stupid spoiled whore or something is the store.

333
00:31:48,953 --> 00:31:49,253
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

334
00:31:49,892 --> 00:31:53,675
[SPEAKER_22]: All those old guys were just standing there watching and it was great.

335
00:32:17,305 --> 00:32:19,206
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see here.

336
00:32:19,226 --> 00:32:19,206
777.

337
00:32:19,246 --> 00:32:20,107
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, that's 21!

338
00:32:20,627 --> 00:32:20,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Legal!

339
00:32:22,228 --> 00:32:23,529
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

340
00:32:23,549 --> 00:32:23,529
777.

341
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:24,389
[SPEAKER_11]: Jackpot!

342
00:32:24,449 --> 00:32:24,869
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

343
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:30,853
[SPEAKER_11]: I do remember Christopher, my roommate, making a comment as we were walking by, though.

344
00:32:30,873 --> 00:32:32,974
[SPEAKER_11]: He said something about, like, very loudly.

345
00:32:33,014 --> 00:32:40,518
[SPEAKER_06]: He said something like, dirty whores, and one of the old guys, like, clicked his tongue at him as if he was, like, tisking at him.

346
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:41,779
[SPEAKER_06]: It's funny.

347
00:32:44,804 --> 00:32:46,405
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what most people do when they listen to this show.

348
00:32:47,726 --> 00:32:47,966
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

349
00:32:48,427 --> 00:32:48,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

350
00:32:49,007 --> 00:32:50,248
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, how was your week?

351
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:50,648
[SPEAKER_09]: How was your day?

352
00:32:52,109 --> 00:32:52,930
[SPEAKER_07]: My week was okay.

353
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:54,131
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't do too much.

354
00:32:55,712 --> 00:32:56,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's see.

355
00:32:57,213 --> 00:32:58,554
[SPEAKER_07]: I went out and got a new game.

356
00:32:58,934 --> 00:33:01,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I have like $90 in credit to GameStop.

357
00:33:01,476 --> 00:33:04,458
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was like... Some of the games stopped because we were bored.

358
00:33:04,939 --> 00:33:06,340
[SPEAKER_07]: So we went around the mall.

359
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,621
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, I want Tetris World!

360
00:33:08,761 --> 00:33:10,122
[SPEAKER_07]: So I gave her Tetris World.

361
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:11,403
[SPEAKER_07]: And I bought myself...

362
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:13,720
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why that's funny.

363
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Girls are funny.

364
00:33:29,321 --> 00:33:50,637
[SPEAKER_07]: and then and then and then what was it we were wandering around looking for other stuff and I'm like hey look there's like one of those shower massagers and I'm like do you want me to get you one of those too and I forget what she said it wasn't like um she's like oh that's that's right um she's all what what would I use that for I'm like masturbation I said that really loud

365
00:33:53,132 --> 00:33:54,433
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that was quite funny.

366
00:33:54,753 --> 00:33:58,535
[SPEAKER_07]: But then also, let's see, what else did I do this week?

367
00:34:01,897 --> 00:34:03,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Watched a lot of X-Play.

368
00:34:04,058 --> 00:34:05,799
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot, a lot of X-Play.

369
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:08,961
[SPEAKER_07]: And now I love the little kitties that are on there, the censor kitties.

370
00:34:09,622 --> 00:34:20,973
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, oh yeah, I also mentioned that I tried, um, pirating Seven Sins, and, um, it didn't work because of the CD, uh, copy protection and stuff, but I'm gonna get the work eventually.

371
00:34:21,093 --> 00:34:25,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now I'm, uh, working on Grand Theft Auto San Andreas for the PC, because that'll be fun.

372
00:34:25,818 --> 00:34:30,283
[SPEAKER_07]: I do have a legal copy, though, for my PlayStation 2, I just wanna play it on the PC now, too.

373
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,151
[SPEAKER_07]: So I say that's completely illegal.

374
00:34:34,111 --> 00:34:43,255
[SPEAKER_07]: And other than that, I've been... I tried playing some Final Fantasy, and the servers got DNS'd attacked again.

375
00:34:43,535 --> 00:34:43,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Again?

376
00:34:43,995 --> 00:34:45,076
[SPEAKER_07]: They haven't fixed that crap yet?

377
00:34:45,156 --> 00:34:45,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Again.

378
00:34:46,056 --> 00:34:48,117
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank God I quit.

379
00:34:48,477 --> 00:34:50,838
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's cool, though, because it was right about when I was going to go to bed.

380
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:52,919
[SPEAKER_07]: I was trying to figure a way to get out of the party.

381
00:34:52,959 --> 00:34:53,800
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, oh, that'll work.

382
00:34:56,141 --> 00:34:57,641
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, that was it.

383
00:34:58,642 --> 00:34:58,922
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

384
00:34:59,617 --> 00:35:01,298
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

385
00:35:22,003 --> 00:35:25,184
[SPEAKER_11]: I started drinking at about 6 o'clock last night, and what was I having?

386
00:35:25,505 --> 00:35:32,208
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I had that Malibu and Pineapple, but it was about the equivalent of about 10 shots of Malibu, and then a little bit of Pineapple in there.

387
00:35:32,628 --> 00:35:37,230
[SPEAKER_11]: So I started drinking that, and I think I had downed that whole thing by 7 o'clock.

388
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:38,830
[SPEAKER_11]: So by that point, I was pretty butted.

389
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:40,391
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I had a couple other miscellaneous shots.

390
00:35:40,411 --> 00:35:41,512
[SPEAKER_11]: I was pretty much drunk by 7.30.

391
00:35:43,012 --> 00:35:49,295
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, finally, I think I sobered up, and I was ready to go to the club about 9 o'clock.

392
00:35:49,775 --> 00:35:50,836
[SPEAKER_11]: No, stop laughing!

393
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:56,431
[SPEAKER_11]: By the time I actually got to the bar, I was pretty sober.

394
00:35:57,371 --> 00:36:01,992
[SPEAKER_11]: Not like 100% sober, like I wouldn't try to drive a car or anything, but I was coherent, right?

395
00:36:02,352 --> 00:36:03,892
[SPEAKER_11]: So I get to the club, and what do I do?

396
00:36:04,032 --> 00:36:06,413
[SPEAKER_11]: I start drinking again, because I want to get drunk again.

397
00:36:06,773 --> 00:36:11,794
[SPEAKER_11]: But then everybody kept leaving, and I was dancing, and I didn't really end up getting drunk, just kind of buzzed.

398
00:36:12,234 --> 00:36:17,295
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is too bad, because that would have been quite an accomplishment to get drunk, sober, and then drunk again all in one night.

399
00:36:17,755 --> 00:36:20,396
[SPEAKER_11]: So I will just have to aspire to do that in a future week.

400
00:36:22,176 --> 00:36:22,656
[SPEAKER_24]: I've done it.

401
00:36:23,252 --> 00:36:25,593
[SPEAKER_11]: I bet you have.

402
00:36:25,673 --> 00:36:26,114
[SPEAKER_11]: I've done it.

403
00:36:26,154 --> 00:36:27,694
[SPEAKER_11]: Didn't you do that here on a show once?

404
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:29,035
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, I did.

405
00:36:30,276 --> 00:36:30,796
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, I did.

406
00:36:30,896 --> 00:36:32,917
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to do another drunk show sometime.

407
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:34,758
[SPEAKER_11]: We kind of missed the last couple three-day weekends.

408
00:36:34,778 --> 00:36:36,138
[SPEAKER_24]: Getting me drunk's expensive.

409
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:39,420
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's find some cheap tequila.

410
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,782
[SPEAKER_11]: What day does the 4th of July fall on?

411
00:36:43,002 --> 00:36:45,023
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm probably doing, well, I don't know.

412
00:36:45,043 --> 00:36:46,764
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually have had a hangover.

413
00:36:46,864 --> 00:36:49,425
[SPEAKER_11]: Didn't you swear after the last drunk show that you weren't doing it again?

414
00:36:50,785 --> 00:36:52,026
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

415
00:36:52,286 --> 00:36:52,846
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey.

416
00:36:53,387 --> 00:36:53,607
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey.

417
00:36:53,687 --> 00:36:54,267
[SPEAKER_11]: Guess what?

418
00:36:54,328 --> 00:36:54,528
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

419
00:36:54,968 --> 00:36:57,169
[SPEAKER_11]: The 4th of July falls on a Monday.

420
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:58,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, right.

421
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,171
[SPEAKER_11]: I work for a bank.

422
00:36:59,711 --> 00:37:00,652
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

423
00:37:00,732 --> 00:37:02,053
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds like we have a date set.

424
00:37:02,573 --> 00:37:03,674
[SPEAKER_11]: We're having a drunk show.

425
00:37:03,894 --> 00:37:05,275
[SPEAKER_11]: You, me, and a bottle of tequila.

426
00:37:05,315 --> 00:37:05,936
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll have a date.

427
00:37:06,776 --> 00:37:07,417
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, I got it.

428
00:37:07,497 --> 00:37:07,657
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

429
00:37:08,297 --> 00:37:10,739
[SPEAKER_22]: I will do a drunk show on one condition.

430
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,982
[SPEAKER_22]: The tequila is the good agave tequila.

431
00:37:15,002 --> 00:37:15,082
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

432
00:37:15,273 --> 00:37:17,194
[SPEAKER_07]: How much is that going to set us back a bottle?

433
00:37:17,794 --> 00:37:21,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Get the crappy shit and then get a Brita water filter.

434
00:37:23,055 --> 00:37:25,716
[SPEAKER_07]: You filter it through a few times, golden.

435
00:37:27,196 --> 00:37:34,298
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of our younger listeners are kind of lost in this conversation right now, and I say that's good because... You're too young to be drinking, children.

436
00:37:34,658 --> 00:37:37,219
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, you should not be drinking until you're of age.

437
00:37:37,259 --> 00:37:39,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly, you've got to get the order of ages right.

438
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:41,660
[SPEAKER_07]: First it's illegitimate children, then it's drinking.

439
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,781
[SPEAKER_22]: I could take Vicodin right now.

440
00:38:04,864 --> 00:38:06,105
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't take Vicodin and then drink.

441
00:38:06,145 --> 00:38:07,105
[SPEAKER_11]: That's really, really bad.

442
00:38:07,765 --> 00:38:08,866
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think I can do it right now.

443
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:14,648
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have to do an all-nighter if it's going to be a drinking show because I can't drive home afterwards.

444
00:38:14,688 --> 00:38:15,849
[SPEAKER_11]: We should do an all-nighter show.

445
00:38:16,889 --> 00:38:17,589
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, God.

446
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:22,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my God, that would be great.

447
00:38:22,972 --> 00:38:24,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Just, like, run out of things to talk about.

448
00:38:24,812 --> 00:38:25,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get Miklatov.

449
00:38:25,533 --> 00:38:27,213
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so drunk.

450
00:38:27,454 --> 00:38:31,515
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get Miklatov here and get him drunk, too, and then we'll probably be able to get around that NDA.

451
00:38:33,717 --> 00:38:36,760
[SPEAKER_11]: So, Black Mikulatov, what do you have for us now?

452
00:38:40,884 --> 00:38:43,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe we could get him to bring some of his co-workers up here.

453
00:38:43,066 --> 00:38:43,806
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll get them all drunk.

454
00:38:43,886 --> 00:38:45,027
[SPEAKER_11]: One of them is liable to spill the beans.

455
00:38:46,128 --> 00:38:47,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Get Jason Enos up here.

456
00:38:48,551 --> 00:38:49,071
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

457
00:38:51,874 --> 00:38:52,594
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what we need to do.

458
00:38:52,674 --> 00:38:53,635
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell Jason Enos to come up.

459
00:38:53,655 --> 00:38:54,196
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll get him drunk.

460
00:38:54,997 --> 00:38:55,958
[SPEAKER_11]: He should come on the show.

461
00:38:56,098 --> 00:38:58,460
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll promise him liquor if you come hang out with us.

462
00:39:03,026 --> 00:39:03,667
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah, fun times.

463
00:39:03,807 --> 00:39:04,107
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

464
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:06,789
[SPEAKER_11]: Enough talk about things that will be happening in the future.

465
00:39:06,849 --> 00:39:15,816
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's talk about things that are happening in the now, such as an upcoming break and an Ultramix 3 song coming your way in about 45 minutes.

466
00:39:15,836 --> 00:39:16,396
[SPEAKER_31]: Eventually.

467
00:39:16,997 --> 00:39:17,197
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

468
00:39:17,777 --> 00:39:21,060
[SPEAKER_11]: And here's like a little bit of a hint as to tonight's song.

469
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:35,357
[SPEAKER_11]: When we discovered what the song was, I could do nothing but laugh because it really fits in with a theme we've been having going on on this show for the past couple weeks.

470
00:39:35,837 --> 00:39:38,719
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, it's so funny.

471
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:42,081
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't even, yeah, this is going to be so funny.

472
00:39:42,201 --> 00:39:42,721
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't wait.

473
00:39:43,641 --> 00:39:44,142
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't wait.

474
00:39:44,362 --> 00:39:46,443
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like the biggest coincidence ever.

475
00:39:47,443 --> 00:39:47,884
[SPEAKER_11]: It's amazing.

476
00:39:48,627 --> 00:39:50,589
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a little, little, little mermaid

477
00:40:14,312 --> 00:40:16,974
[SPEAKER_15]: Nobody wants to know, and our beautiful world

478

479

Clever!

481

Clever!

482
00:42:13,995 --> 00:42:14,996
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks for watching!

483
00:42:28,374 --> 00:42:43,020
[SPEAKER_20]: You gotta easy pay, you gotta easy pay Akirategao no yokudakita haguruma no yori Yakesuku hizashi ga korechikuru atari Daremo kane to mirai, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no Utagau koto wo isu

Thank you for watching!

485
00:44:01,707 --> 00:44:03,088
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for watching!

Thank you for watching!

487
00:46:07,017 --> 00:46:08,898
Thank you for watching!

488
00:46:43,501 --> 00:46:44,623
I've Been Waiting For You

489
00:47:10,479 --> 00:47:13,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.

490
00:47:14,301 --> 00:47:16,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio.

491
00:47:17,982 --> 00:47:20,263
[SPEAKER_11]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

492
00:47:21,084 --> 00:47:23,985
[SPEAKER_11]: Episode number 146.

493
00:47:24,085 --> 00:47:25,586
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to have a contest to name your car?

494
00:47:25,606 --> 00:47:27,246
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to have a contest to name my car.

495
00:47:27,266 --> 00:47:28,647
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought you were going to name your car God.

496
00:47:29,767 --> 00:47:35,390
[SPEAKER_22]: No, because then I'd start calling it, you know, like, every self a deity or Jesus or...

497
00:47:36,914 --> 00:47:39,935
[SPEAKER_11]: And when I say, oh my god, I'm usually not referring to your car.

498
00:47:40,135 --> 00:47:41,435
[SPEAKER_22]: But I have a friend who goes, oh my car.

499
00:47:43,715 --> 00:47:44,976
[SPEAKER_22]: Seriously, she goes, oh my car.

500
00:47:45,876 --> 00:47:46,176
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

501
00:47:46,816 --> 00:47:47,456
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty awesome.

502
00:47:49,877 --> 00:47:53,798
[SPEAKER_11]: The bitch tickler is being suggested in the chat room.

503
00:47:54,018 --> 00:47:54,658
[SPEAKER_24]: That's okay.

504
00:47:54,758 --> 00:47:57,798
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, that sounds like a hardcore band.

505
00:47:58,819 --> 00:48:00,279
[SPEAKER_11]: Like an industrial band.

506
00:48:01,073 --> 00:48:03,355
[SPEAKER_11]: Live, it's Bitch Tickler!

507
00:48:04,115 --> 00:48:17,105
[SPEAKER_22]: If someone can suggest a name for my car that fits in with my interests and my pretty, pretty car with those stupid key skirts on it, then you will get something nice from me after I move.

508
00:48:17,465 --> 00:48:18,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe like a piece of the car?

509
00:48:18,947 --> 00:48:19,227
[SPEAKER_22]: No!

510
00:48:19,247 --> 00:48:20,908
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck no!

511
00:48:22,329 --> 00:48:22,930
[SPEAKER_22]: My!

512
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:23,930
[SPEAKER_22]: How about a dust ball?

513
00:48:24,371 --> 00:48:25,852
[SPEAKER_22]: It's called my car.

514
00:48:27,053 --> 00:48:28,614
[SPEAKER_22]: And nobody gets a part of it but me.

515
00:48:31,709 --> 00:48:34,270
[SPEAKER_22]: My car.

516
00:48:38,492 --> 00:48:39,252
[SPEAKER_21]: My car!

517
00:48:40,453 --> 00:48:41,053
[SPEAKER_21]: Mine!

518
00:48:41,073 --> 00:48:42,394
[SPEAKER_21]: I waited a month!

519
00:48:42,734 --> 00:48:43,154
[SPEAKER_21]: Mine!

520
00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:49,818
[SPEAKER_11]: We're still going to be doing the Ultra Mix 3 song in about 30 minutes.

521
00:48:50,158 --> 00:48:52,219
[SPEAKER_11]: But for now, let's talk about another dancing game series.

522
00:48:52,439 --> 00:48:53,319
[SPEAKER_11]: Into Groove.

523
00:48:53,479 --> 00:48:56,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Into Groove was released, I guess, this week.

524
00:48:57,578 --> 00:48:59,300
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't get the whole in the groove thing.

525
00:48:59,320 --> 00:48:59,981
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what's funny?

526
00:49:00,041 --> 00:49:18,238
[SPEAKER_11]: And we went into both those game stores today and in both of them I completely neglected to check to see if the groove was in stock because I just... We went into GameStop three times and went into EB twice and none of those times did I bother to check for in the groove because that just wasn't the thing that was on my mind today.

527
00:49:18,298 --> 00:49:18,739
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel bad.

528
00:49:20,527 --> 00:49:26,488
[SPEAKER_11]: No, but the honest, you know, I would probably pick up In The Groove because, you know, I'm a dance game whore.

529
00:49:27,408 --> 00:49:30,949
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't have a PS2 American, and I have yet to mod my Japanese one.

530
00:49:31,449 --> 00:49:34,670
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't know if I want to mod my Japanese one because I'm afraid of fucking it up.

531
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:35,470
[SPEAKER_22]: You'll fuck it up.

532
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:35,790
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't do it.

533
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:36,190
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

534
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:38,951
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think I'll just wait for the slim PS2.

535
00:49:39,371 --> 00:49:42,171
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, actually, I don't want a slim PS2 because I want one that can put a hard drive in it.

536
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:44,512
[SPEAKER_11]: So I have to wait for those PS2s to come.

537
00:49:44,552 --> 00:49:46,992
[SPEAKER_07]: I already have In The Groove with all the suns unlocked.

538
00:49:47,692 --> 00:49:48,253
[SPEAKER_11]: You already got it?

539
00:49:48,593 --> 00:49:49,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's called Step Mania.

540
00:49:50,646 --> 00:49:51,407
[SPEAKER_07]: I had it for years.

541
00:49:51,427 --> 00:49:53,228
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell?

542
00:49:54,489 --> 00:49:55,389
[SPEAKER_07]: He made it funny.

543
00:49:55,789 --> 00:49:57,691
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to buy it for the PlayStation 2.

544
00:49:57,851 --> 00:49:59,352
[SPEAKER_07]: I already have it on PC for free.

545
00:49:59,692 --> 00:50:01,213
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, this is the weird thing I don't get.

546
00:50:01,273 --> 00:50:07,197
[SPEAKER_11]: In the Groove was supposed to be released, what, June 17th, and then all of a sudden, surprise!

547
00:50:07,397 --> 00:50:15,262
[SPEAKER_07]: It's by June 17th because they realized... I don't think Red Octane has quite the shipping capability as, say, EA.

548
00:50:15,422 --> 00:50:16,303
[SPEAKER_07]: So they were just like...

549
00:50:16,883 --> 00:50:18,124
[SPEAKER_07]: They ship as much as we can.

550
00:50:19,605 --> 00:50:29,995
[SPEAKER_11]: That's understandable, but it's kind of interesting because that's not kind of what you're used to seeing for video game releases because usually it's like, okay, video games are going to ship this day to shelve the next day.

551
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:31,936
[SPEAKER_11]: The traditional game release always works like that.

552
00:50:32,177 --> 00:50:35,219
[SPEAKER_11]: If Zelda's going to come out, you know it's going to ship and then shelve all that.

553
00:50:35,259 --> 00:50:42,005
[SPEAKER_11]: But then Red Octane's just kind of like, well, in the groove, it'll show up around June 17th.

554
00:50:42,145 --> 00:50:43,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe you'll see it a little sooner, but

555
00:50:44,267 --> 00:50:45,288
[SPEAKER_11]: June 17th will be late.

556
00:51:11,826 --> 00:51:22,058
[SPEAKER_11]: So, because of the fact that I don't have a PS2 American, although I need to get one, because I want In the Groove, and I want Xtreme 2 for... And we love Katamari!

557
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:27,945
[SPEAKER_11]: And we are Katamari, you know, and I gotta pick up the dance games that I was pretty much leeching from Loki when I lived there.

558
00:51:28,785 --> 00:51:29,905
[SPEAKER_11]: So I got to pick all those up again.

559
00:51:30,226 --> 00:51:31,846
[SPEAKER_11]: Although, I thought I owned one of those.

560
00:51:32,146 --> 00:51:32,566
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe not.

561
00:51:32,926 --> 00:51:33,667
[SPEAKER_11]: Max 2, I think?

562
00:51:33,707 --> 00:51:35,027
[SPEAKER_11]: I did own Max 2 at one point.

563
00:51:35,107 --> 00:51:35,887
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even know where it is.

564
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:36,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't that sad?

565
00:51:37,248 --> 00:51:41,229
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, so I got to get a PS2 at some point.

566
00:51:41,249 --> 00:51:51,972
[SPEAKER_11]: But in the meanwhile, those of you guys out there, you've already been picking up copies of In the Groove, and you've been posting to message boards about what songs are being unlocked and when.

567
00:51:53,753 --> 00:52:21,828
[SPEAKER_11]: And I believe, I'm trying to find out what the hidden In The Groove 2 songs were here Somebody had posted a complete list Somewhere in here, I'm looking through some threads over on ITGFreak.com Where they talk about In The Groove a lot Liquid Moon is one of the songs from In The Groove 2 That is in the game And I want to say Tribal Style is another one

568
00:52:22,964 --> 00:52:28,968
[SPEAKER_11]: Funk Factory, and Incognito?

569
00:52:29,449 --> 00:52:29,869
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that it?

570
00:52:30,009 --> 00:52:31,710
[SPEAKER_11]: Or is that in the group one?

571
00:52:31,830 --> 00:52:32,711
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even know.

572
00:52:37,294 --> 00:52:44,479
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure somebody in the chat room will be sure to correct me, but I know folks over there were really excited about getting to play some songs from

573
00:52:46,684 --> 00:52:47,665
[SPEAKER_11]: in the groove too.

574
00:52:47,945 --> 00:52:48,926
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's kind of neat.

575
00:52:48,986 --> 00:52:52,749
[SPEAKER_11]: I do like how they did that is that they brought back some songs.

576
00:52:54,430 --> 00:53:00,015
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, brought songs that are going to be in the next mix, like preview tracks like these do, the old DDRs.

577
00:53:00,175 --> 00:53:02,456
[SPEAKER_07]: So how many songs have I got unlocked before the game is good?

578
00:53:06,179 --> 00:53:07,020
[SPEAKER_10]: You're ruthless.

579
00:53:09,482 --> 00:53:10,863
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm never going to buy that game.

580
00:53:11,644 --> 00:53:14,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe if I get it for free or something, but I'll never...

581
00:53:15,276 --> 00:53:17,917
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll never, you know, pay my hard-earned money for that crap.

582
00:53:18,618 --> 00:53:21,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead, I'll buy, like, Dog's Life 2 or something.

583
00:53:23,501 --> 00:53:24,301
[SPEAKER_11]: You're really bad.

584
00:53:27,963 --> 00:53:29,544
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to go to one of my other resources.

585
00:53:29,604 --> 00:53:30,164
[SPEAKER_11]: I know how this is on.

586
00:53:30,184 --> 00:53:30,524
[SPEAKER_11]: There we go.

587
00:53:30,544 --> 00:53:42,011
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it's Funk Factory by Money Deluxe, Incognito by Inspector K, Tribal Style by Ka, and Kid Whatever with Wake Up, which apparently is getting really good reviews already, so...

588
00:53:46,641 --> 00:53:47,602
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm being corrected.

589
00:53:47,882 --> 00:53:49,643
[SPEAKER_11]: Liquid Moon is not a song from In The Groove 2.

590
00:53:49,983 --> 00:53:53,586
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just one of those ones that you could only play before in the non-stop mode.

591
00:53:53,826 --> 00:53:54,467
[SPEAKER_11]: How would I know that?

592
00:53:54,487 --> 00:53:55,087
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't play enough.

593
00:53:55,507 --> 00:53:55,808
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

594
00:53:56,228 --> 00:53:57,008
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry to disappoint.

595
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:01,372
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently you can unlock modifiers as well.

596
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:03,533
[SPEAKER_11]: Bumpy, I think, was one of them.

597
00:54:04,294 --> 00:54:05,935
[SPEAKER_22]: Does it have a modifier to make it a good game?

598
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:13,055
[SPEAKER_07]: I hear it has link mode with DDR, but they're not similar.

599
00:54:13,435 --> 00:54:13,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't worry.

600
00:54:13,755 --> 00:54:13,995
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

601
00:54:14,956 --> 00:54:16,897
[SPEAKER_22]: Or does it have pump-it-up mode?

602
00:54:19,518 --> 00:54:23,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it does have hand plants, so I guess, yeah, sort of similar.

603
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:28,182
[SPEAKER_22]: Does it have we are under the bed sheets with Endemiro mode?

604
00:54:29,703 --> 00:54:29,803
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

605
00:54:32,659 --> 00:54:52,806
[SPEAKER_11]: Some folks in chat room were talking about before the show that In The Groove 2 is out and about, apparently is starting to make its way out towards arcades, which kind of lines up with some chat that's been going on on the various web forums saying that In The Groove 2 is supposed to be shipping in this time frame early June, so In The Groove 2 could be coming to an arcade near you.

606
00:54:53,946 --> 00:54:58,372
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't heard if it's new cabinets and the whole works or what.

607
00:54:58,472 --> 00:55:03,438
[SPEAKER_11]: I imagine the box door thing had to go away, but there's no clear answer to the box door.

608
00:55:03,478 --> 00:55:06,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me be the first to do a resounding, Yippee!

609
00:55:07,423 --> 00:55:09,185
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god, I can't wait!

610
00:55:09,946 --> 00:55:10,987
[SPEAKER_13]: The groove too!

611
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:11,828
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll be so much fun!

612
00:55:11,848 --> 00:55:12,429
[SPEAKER_11]: No, sorry.

613
00:55:12,669 --> 00:55:12,949
[SPEAKER_11]: Sucks.

614
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:16,432
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, look, I know you don't give a shit, and I know you don't give a shit.

615
00:55:17,012 --> 00:55:17,672
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll try it!

616
00:55:18,193 --> 00:55:23,136
[SPEAKER_11]: But there are people out there in the community that do care, so I'm just trying to report on their behalf.

617
00:55:23,396 --> 00:55:34,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Because from what I'm hearing, one of the folks in the chat room was talking to me about In the Groove 2 before the show, and was saying that it's very polished, like it's much more polished, and now we get characters...

618
00:55:34,782 --> 00:55:42,225
[SPEAKER_22]: You can buy boots at the thrift store and polish them up, but they're still boots from the thrift store.

619
00:55:42,265 --> 00:55:48,287
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, there's hot new characters named Paige and Shemmy in the game.

620
00:55:48,447 --> 00:55:50,087
[SPEAKER_11]: We need Mr. Spanky!

621
00:55:50,108 --> 00:55:51,548
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kidding, I completely made that up.

622
00:55:51,868 --> 00:55:52,888
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't send the hate mail, please.

623
00:55:56,630 --> 00:55:56,930
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

624
00:55:57,685 --> 00:56:09,998
[SPEAKER_11]: So, In The Groove 2 is out, and apparently it's really polished, and all the songs from In The Groove 1, and then some, including some DDR crossovers like Bambi, and just some crazy stuff.

625
00:56:11,019 --> 00:56:16,886
[SPEAKER_11]: And Novice Mode's in it now, so, should be interesting, and maybe might change some of your guys' mind on In The Groove.

626
00:56:16,946 --> 00:56:18,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, you gonna give In The Groove 2 a try?

627
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:21,110
[SPEAKER_11]: You gotta be fair.

628
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:23,471
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on, you gotta be fair and balanced.

629
00:56:23,811 --> 00:56:26,332
[SPEAKER_22]: Will you at least take a piss on it if it caught on fire?

630
00:56:26,352 --> 00:56:26,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop it.

631
00:56:26,912 --> 00:56:27,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop encouraging him.

632
00:56:30,393 --> 00:56:33,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Fine, I'll look at it, but it's gonna be the same damn game.

633
00:56:33,854 --> 00:56:35,574
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, ooh, it's like red now.

634
00:56:35,714 --> 00:56:37,114
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's a pretty new cabinet.

635
00:56:37,154 --> 00:56:41,676
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's a new cabinet, and the fact that it's in a new cabinet means it's not DDR anymore, right?

636
00:56:41,776 --> 00:56:46,677
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I'm reading on the interweb, is that it's in a new cabinet, so it's not the same game anymore.

637
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:49,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, that's exactly what it means, because you know what?

638
00:56:49,778 --> 00:57:00,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Cabinets have this thing called JAMA, meaning I can put a Pac-Man game in a normal stand-up cabinet, or I can put a Pac-Man game in a driving cabinet, or I can put a Pac-Man game in a goddamn Guitar Freaks cabinet.

639
00:57:00,822 --> 00:57:02,223
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still the same fucking game.

640
00:57:02,983 --> 00:57:04,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Doesn't matter what kind of cabinet you put it in.

641
00:57:04,984 --> 00:57:05,744
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what?

642
00:57:06,224 --> 00:57:09,886
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like I just said in the chatroom, you know, the first in the group was basically shit.

643
00:57:10,748 --> 00:57:12,209
[SPEAKER_22]: But shit makes the flowers grow.

644
00:57:12,669 --> 00:57:15,070
[SPEAKER_22]: So maybe if we bury this shit, it'll grow something good.

645
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:18,371
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, the chatroom is not pleased with this track of conversation.

646
00:57:18,791 --> 00:57:19,572
[SPEAKER_11]: Guess what?

647
00:57:19,592 --> 00:57:20,452
[SPEAKER_11]: Too fucking bad.

648
00:57:20,472 --> 00:57:23,193
[SPEAKER_11]: There's about five people here saying stop hating.

649
00:57:23,213 --> 00:57:25,474
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are the only people that bought the game.

650
00:57:27,575 --> 00:57:28,555
[SPEAKER_22]: Boo-hoo.

651
00:57:29,235 --> 00:57:30,276
[SPEAKER_22]: I said I'll give it a try.

652
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:34,321
[SPEAKER_22]: The first one had good music, but it was just DDR, only crappy.

653
00:57:34,581 --> 00:57:36,902
[SPEAKER_07]: I tried the first one, and it sucked ass, the end.

654
00:57:37,702 --> 00:57:40,042
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, it was DDR, only crappy.

655
00:57:42,843 --> 00:57:44,404
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't wait to see the review on Xplay.

656
00:57:44,624 --> 00:57:46,164
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to see the next one.

657
00:57:46,204 --> 00:57:48,745
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently it's been getting decent reviews.

658
00:57:48,825 --> 00:57:59,168
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know on what planet in the groove looks better than DDR, because it gave me eye strain after one song, and I never got eye strain on DDR.

659
00:58:00,329 --> 00:58:07,457
[SPEAKER_11]: For the record, I'm still of the school of thought here where in the groove is just another dance game to me.

660
00:58:07,557 --> 00:58:09,239
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't hate it, but I don't love it.

661
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:13,965
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, it's not as good as the fanboys say it is, but it's not as bad as the haters say it is.

662
00:58:13,985 --> 00:58:17,589
[SPEAKER_11]: That includes you guys, sorry, but I don't think it's as bad as you guys make it out to be.

663
00:58:20,111 --> 00:58:21,491
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate the effort.

664
00:58:21,511 --> 00:58:24,753
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't say it was bad, I just said it was kind of not good.

665
00:58:24,893 --> 00:58:37,598
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate the effort they're trying to put into reviving the dance game community, but I just think they made some mistakes along the way, but that's okay.

666
00:58:37,658 --> 00:58:39,299
[SPEAKER_11]: I would have made mistakes too, so...

667
00:58:40,407 --> 00:58:42,768
[SPEAKER_11]: We've made mistakes doing a radio program.

668
00:58:42,828 --> 00:58:44,029
[SPEAKER_11]: It happens.

669
00:58:44,589 --> 00:58:51,692
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, if you are a fan of In the Groove, which apparently there are quite a few of you out there listening, because we're getting hate mail already, pick it up.

670
00:58:51,752 --> 00:58:52,572
[SPEAKER_11]: It's out in stores.

671
00:58:53,673 --> 00:58:55,594
[SPEAKER_11]: At least by June 17th, it'll be there.

672
00:58:55,994 --> 00:58:57,074
[SPEAKER_11]: But you might have it already.

673
00:58:57,094 --> 00:58:59,415
[SPEAKER_11]: We just don't know because they're shipping it randomly.

674
00:58:59,715 --> 00:59:02,456
[SPEAKER_07]: In the Groove is only surviving the arcades because there's no new DDR.

675
00:59:03,197 --> 00:59:04,037
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the only thing.

676
00:59:04,397 --> 00:59:05,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Once new DDR comes out, bye-bye.

677
00:59:06,638 --> 00:59:09,701
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, it's like, I could take my hair and dye it purple.

678
00:59:10,281 --> 00:59:12,243
[SPEAKER_22]: Doesn't change the fact it's going to grow back brown.

679
00:59:13,684 --> 00:59:21,910
[SPEAKER_22]: So, you can't, you know, take DDR, add modifiers to it, it's still going to, you know, always play like DDR.

680
00:59:24,032 --> 00:59:24,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever, I'm done.

681
00:59:25,293 --> 00:59:25,774
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care anymore.

682
00:59:25,794 --> 00:59:26,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, good.

683
00:59:28,576 --> 00:59:30,558
[SPEAKER_11]: I still am going to harass people at Best Buy, though.

684
00:59:31,539 --> 00:59:34,260
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, they're doing this live tour thing, right?

685
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:35,081
[SPEAKER_11]: What's going on?

686
00:59:35,661 --> 00:59:36,921
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, live tour, woo!

687
00:59:39,062 --> 00:59:47,166
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what's interesting, and if you want to find out more information about this live in the groove tour or whatever they're doing, there is actually a website on Myspace.

688
00:59:47,226 --> 00:59:50,027
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is interesting because this goes beyond just dancing games.

689
00:59:50,067 --> 00:59:53,509
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we usually talk about mostly dancing games in the three hour show here, but...

690
00:59:53,993 --> 01:00:00,076
[SPEAKER_11]: This whole Myspace trend for promoting your games has gone beyond just the dance games recently.

691
01:00:00,737 --> 01:00:05,439
[SPEAKER_11]: Donkey Konga 2 has its own Myspace now, which I think is very, I don't know, interesting?

692
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:07,861
[SPEAKER_11]: If that's the word to describe it.

693
01:00:09,041 --> 01:00:11,823
[SPEAKER_11]: We actually posted the links to both of these on our website earlier this week.

694
01:00:11,963 --> 01:00:16,786
[SPEAKER_11]: Not just the Donkey Konga 2 one, but also a link to the Red Octane page on Myspace.

695
01:00:17,486 --> 01:00:20,948
[SPEAKER_11]: And Red Octane has their own little section of Myspace.com.

696
01:00:22,149 --> 01:00:22,269
[SPEAKER_11]: And...

697
01:00:24,782 --> 01:00:51,668
[SPEAKER_11]: And in the MySpace, they actually have posted all their live shows that they're going to do Because they're actually going to tour in the groove around And I think this probably has to do with the fact that you remember on DDR Freak a few weeks ago They were putting out a call to, they were going to hire, I don't know, Fly Girls or something They were going to be promoting this game, helping to promote the game Well, they're going out on tour, and the tour kicks off June 24th at the Best Buy in Dublin

698
01:00:52,708 --> 01:01:06,131
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it goes on to Santa Rosa on the 25th, Roseville, which is the one near us, on the 26th, which is my birthday, by the way, which means I'm especially not going to be there, and it has nothing to do with like or dislike for In the Groove, but I'm actually going on a company trip, so I can't...

699
01:01:06,536 --> 01:01:07,076
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't be there.

700
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:09,838
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, he's trying to get as far away from In the Groove as possible.

701
01:01:09,858 --> 01:01:10,378
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, right.

702
01:01:10,618 --> 01:01:21,964
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's going to roll through most of California, making stops at Anime Expo on July 4th and San Diego Comic Con on July 17th, stopping along some various Best Buy stores on the way.

703
01:01:22,324 --> 01:01:24,945
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it's going to roll through some other conventions.

704
01:01:25,726 --> 01:01:32,329
[SPEAKER_11]: No other Best Buy stores yet, so if you're not into Best Buy in California, sorry you're out of luck, but they're going to various conventions throughout August.

705
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:36,652
[SPEAKER_11]: Just when I thought Anime Expo couldn't get any worse, I'm proven wrong.

706
01:01:57,659 --> 01:01:59,340
[SPEAKER_11]: So they will be taking that out.

707
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:04,602
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you want to try In The Groove, maybe you haven't played yet, don't take our word for it or not.

708
01:02:04,682 --> 01:02:05,782
[SPEAKER_11]: Play the game yourself.

709
01:02:05,842 --> 01:02:06,603
[SPEAKER_11]: Make your own decisions.

710
01:02:06,643 --> 01:02:08,003
[SPEAKER_11]: You can go catch them out on the road.

711
01:02:08,384 --> 01:02:17,387
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you want to check out the tour schedule to complete one for yourself, www.myspace.com slash redoctane, all one word.

712
01:02:18,028 --> 01:02:18,908
[SPEAKER_11]: So there you have it.

713
01:02:20,905 --> 01:02:23,786
[SPEAKER_11]: So it should be interesting, to say the least.

714
01:02:25,906 --> 01:02:34,028
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go ahead and we're going to go to a quick break and then we're going to come back and we're going to talk a little bit about Ultramix 3, specifically a brand new song in Ultramix 3.

715
01:02:34,628 --> 01:02:39,749
[SPEAKER_11]: Also the cage match when we come back a little later and some more stuff.

716
01:02:39,789 --> 01:02:41,489
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got more news for you guys when we come back.

717
01:02:41,529 --> 01:02:44,250
[SPEAKER_11]: In this break we'll do some music from 2DX.

718
01:02:44,810 --> 01:02:48,251
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll start it off with a little bit of Setsugeka from Tent Style.

719
01:02:48,511 --> 01:02:49,271
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll be back after this.

720
01:02:52,219 --> 01:02:52,971
Thanks for watching!

721
01:03:40,012 --> 01:03:40,834
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for watching!

722
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,563
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks for watching!

723
01:07:28,576 --> 01:07:28,877
and many more.

724
01:08:16,242 --> 01:08:16,547
Thank you.

725
01:09:00,459 --> 01:09:01,080
DarkSakura.com

726
01:10:32,584 --> 01:10:38,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

727
01:10:43,328 --> 01:10:47,730
[SPEAKER_11]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, some music there in that break from the 2DX series.

728
01:10:49,370 --> 01:11:05,157
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, starting it off was Ryu with Setsugeka from 2DX10Style, 2DX5Style Consumer Track, C-R-A-C-K-R by Gwashi, and 2DX7Style, Zero One by Mr. T, and finally 2DX Red, John Robinson, K-K-K.

729
01:11:07,329 --> 01:11:08,730
[SPEAKER_11]: What was the last one you heard there in that break?

730
01:11:10,352 --> 01:11:11,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Skype line is open.

731
01:11:11,533 --> 01:11:12,815
[SPEAKER_11]: We decided we'd open it up a little bit.

732
01:11:12,855 --> 01:11:17,780
[SPEAKER_11]: We are going to be doing the brand new song from DDR Ultramix 3 very shortly here.

733
01:11:18,521 --> 01:11:27,951
[SPEAKER_11]: But I figured after that last little bit on we were talking about the In The Groove Home version, I figured there might be somebody who might want to provide a counterpoint.

734
01:11:28,451 --> 01:11:31,474
[SPEAKER_11]: via our Skype line, I don't know, so I am opening that up there.

735
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:39,941
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to join us on the Skype line, www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on the little link that says Interact With Us, and that's how you can call in on the Skype line.

736
01:11:39,961 --> 01:11:40,421
[SPEAKER_11]: But you know what?

737
01:11:41,162 --> 01:11:46,106
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure how interactive people want to be tonight, because I'm not seeing a lot of our listeners logged into Skype right now.

738
01:11:46,126 --> 01:11:46,907
[SPEAKER_11]: I say we have...

739
01:11:51,021 --> 01:11:53,965
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, Paris Hilton chat is so outdated.

740
01:11:54,425 --> 01:11:57,229
[SPEAKER_07]: This is sad, and I've got to admit it, okay?

741
01:11:57,970 --> 01:12:06,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Nelly was bored, so she was watching, get this, it was that, oh god, chaotic...

742
01:12:07,523 --> 01:12:11,087
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw way too many episodes of Chaotic, and what did it teach me?

743
01:12:11,107 --> 01:12:13,230
[SPEAKER_07]: It taught me that Britney Spears is a whore.

744
01:12:13,810 --> 01:12:20,117
[SPEAKER_07]: And I already knew that Britney Spears is a whore, but, like, she's just fucking, like, Oh, Kevin Verron!

745
01:12:20,438 --> 01:12:21,018
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Kevin!

746
01:12:21,138 --> 01:12:21,579
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Kevin!

747
01:12:21,859 --> 01:12:23,841
[SPEAKER_13]: I had sex three times today!

748
01:12:24,262 --> 01:12:25,163
[SPEAKER_13]: Three times!

749
01:12:25,183 --> 01:12:26,845
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a fucking whore!

750
01:12:26,885 --> 01:12:27,686
[SPEAKER_13]: Da-da-da-da-da!

751
01:12:28,106 --> 01:12:30,807
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's, you know, basically what Chaotic is about.

752
01:12:30,827 --> 01:12:38,731
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was reading just now that Chaotic's actually going to be debuting a brand new Britney Spears video at the end of the show.

753
01:12:38,831 --> 01:12:39,492
[SPEAKER_08]: That's wonderful.

754
01:12:39,872 --> 01:12:42,713
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, I figured I'd talk about that stuff.

755
01:12:42,913 --> 01:12:44,914
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was watching the MTV Movie Awards.

756
01:12:44,974 --> 01:12:47,135
[SPEAKER_11]: Goddamn, I don't know why MTV was on all weekend.

757
01:12:47,276 --> 01:12:48,536
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, that skyline is open.

758
01:12:48,576 --> 01:12:50,217
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't have to talk about it in a group if you don't want to.

759
01:12:50,357 --> 01:12:52,018
[SPEAKER_07]: But they had, what was it, they were...

760
01:12:52,458 --> 01:12:55,079
[SPEAKER_07]: They had Jimmy Fallon hosting, which he's not funny at all.

761
01:12:55,459 --> 01:12:57,480
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they had Nicole Richie.

762
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:59,701
[SPEAKER_07]: She was actually interviewing people on the runway.

763
01:13:00,241 --> 01:13:04,963
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was really bad because she's just like, Oh my God, you're so hot!

764
01:13:05,123 --> 01:13:05,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God!

765
01:13:05,943 --> 01:13:07,384
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was just completely stupid.

766
01:13:08,044 --> 01:13:09,625
[SPEAKER_07]: I really hated that show.

767
01:13:09,645 --> 01:13:17,208
[SPEAKER_11]: But for some reason, I watched it because I... Why don't you just... If your girlfriend feels like she has to watch this shit, leave the room.

768
01:13:18,569 --> 01:13:19,749
[SPEAKER_11]: We're getting a call on Skype.

769
01:13:20,269 --> 01:13:20,809
[SPEAKER_11]: Praise the Lord.

770
01:13:20,869 --> 01:13:22,090
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

771
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:27,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think I was elected by the chat channel to call in and make him shut up.

772
01:13:28,095 --> 01:13:29,376
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we will do so.

773
01:13:29,497 --> 01:13:30,978
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, shut up.

774
01:13:31,038 --> 01:13:31,779
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell him to shut up.

775
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, shut up, man.

776
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:33,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

777
01:13:36,123 --> 01:13:37,124
[SPEAKER_11]: So, what's on your mind?

778
01:13:38,265 --> 01:13:39,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, drinking.

779
01:13:40,007 --> 01:13:41,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, not much.

780
01:13:41,669 --> 01:13:41,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh,

781
01:13:42,452 --> 01:13:47,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically laughing at people as they bicker back and forth of which dance game is better.

782
01:13:47,436 --> 01:13:49,118
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of the neutral party in this.

783
01:13:49,498 --> 01:13:55,323
[SPEAKER_11]: Now you kind of came into listening to Orange Lounge Radio Live, I'm assuming from our podcast that we do, right?

784
01:13:55,383 --> 01:13:56,624
[SPEAKER_11]: Where we talk about other video games?

785
01:13:56,664 --> 01:13:58,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, yeah.

786
01:13:58,366 --> 01:14:01,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody gave me one of the podcasts and I was like, hey, this sounds pretty good.

787
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:04,351
[SPEAKER_05]: So I tuned in last week and just liked it.

788
01:14:04,531 --> 01:14:07,013
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, welcome to all our folks who've been listening to the podcast.

789
01:14:07,994 --> 01:14:18,483
[SPEAKER_11]: We do do this three-hour show on Sunday nights, and since it kind of started about Bomani and music video games and music-based things, we still talk about them a whole awful lot here on this show, so it's something you'll get used to.

790
01:14:18,503 --> 01:14:20,825
[SPEAKER_11]: There are a lot of really good music games out there, though.

791
01:14:21,306 --> 01:14:24,949
[SPEAKER_11]: But we have been kind of trying to branch out, as you kind of saw last week.

792
01:14:24,989 --> 01:14:25,850
[SPEAKER_11]: We talk about, you know, just

793
01:14:26,210 --> 01:14:26,610
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever.

794
01:14:26,690 --> 01:14:28,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Pop culture stuff, other video games we like.

795
01:14:28,892 --> 01:14:33,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Bringing up anything Nickelodeon is insanely cool with me.

796
01:14:33,995 --> 01:14:38,477
[SPEAKER_11]: That was kind of just a weird show last week when we just were getting into Nickelodeon.

797
01:14:38,497 --> 01:14:39,358
[SPEAKER_11]: But hey, cool with me.

798
01:14:39,438 --> 01:14:41,619
[SPEAKER_11]: Chatroom seemed to dig it.

799
01:14:41,659 --> 01:14:42,880
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm all cool with that.

800
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:46,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much anything old school in my book is really good.

801
01:14:46,401 --> 01:15:02,049
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's this whole, like, six degrees of separation thing going on because if you think about it this way, you have Nickelodeon, you have that show Roundhouse, and then the guy on Roundhouse was the MC at Konami's booth at E3 this year showing off the new music games.

802
01:15:02,409 --> 01:15:03,189
[SPEAKER_05]: So, see, it relates.

803
01:15:03,209 --> 01:15:07,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Some kind of six degrees of separation with video games or something.

804
01:15:07,191 --> 01:15:08,532
[SPEAKER_05]: There's bound to be a way to do it.

805
01:15:08,672 --> 01:15:09,172
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

806
01:15:09,532 --> 01:15:12,594
[SPEAKER_11]: We could connect anything back to, oh, we're really talking about the money.

807
01:15:12,634 --> 01:15:12,974
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't worry.

808
01:15:13,194 --> 01:15:15,176
[SPEAKER_22]: But can we connect it to Kevin Bacon?

809
01:15:16,177 --> 01:15:20,422
[SPEAKER_11]: Possibly Did Kevin Bacon ever make a guest spot at E3?

810
01:15:20,722 --> 01:15:27,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, okay, maybe Gary Coleman was at E3 I don't know, was Gary Coleman and Kevin Bacon ever in a movie together?

811
01:15:28,049 --> 01:15:30,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Gary Coleman was beating up people at the mall

812
01:15:33,376 --> 01:15:34,356
[SPEAKER_11]: Did Kevin Bacon do that?

813
01:15:34,416 --> 01:15:34,796
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

814
01:15:35,476 --> 01:15:37,077
[SPEAKER_22]: Kevin Bacon has gone to a mall!

815
01:15:37,377 --> 01:15:37,597
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

816
01:15:37,857 --> 01:15:46,599
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, as our, uh, a person who's calling in who isn't too familiar with the dance and music games, what kind of news stories have been interesting you this week in the general gaming world?

817
01:15:47,279 --> 01:15:52,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, general gaming world, uh, I'd probably have to, well, GTA, uh, San Andreas is out on PC.

818
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:54,301
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yes.

819
01:15:54,381 --> 01:15:55,981
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to admit to it, I'm a freak.

820
01:15:56,001 --> 01:15:57,821
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost beat it and I just got it today.

821
01:15:58,201 --> 01:16:00,662
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, had you played it on PlayStation 2 or any of that previously?

822
01:16:01,752 --> 01:16:07,859
[SPEAKER_05]: I played it on PlayStation 2 and hated it, because it just didn't feel right to me, so I got it for PC instead.

823
01:16:07,979 --> 01:16:16,949
[SPEAKER_11]: I've heard a lot of bitching about the controls in that game, and I've played a little bit of San Andreas, but most of my San Andreas experience was watching Loki play, because he's better at killing people than I am.

824
01:16:16,969 --> 01:16:18,932
[SPEAKER_05]: The plane missions are a bitch.

825
01:16:19,318 --> 01:16:24,760
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, he also likes to load down the game with cheat codes, and then he'll just skydive with no parachute.

826
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,981
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, what kind of stuff were you doing on those flying missions?

827
01:16:27,281 --> 01:16:30,842
[SPEAKER_11]: You used to, like, fly straight into the ground and all this crazy stuff.

828
01:16:30,922 --> 01:16:32,002
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't doing that.

829
01:16:32,262 --> 01:16:32,842
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember.

830
01:16:32,862 --> 01:16:35,703
[SPEAKER_05]: You can actually chop up people with a propeller if you're good enough.

831
01:16:35,723 --> 01:16:36,384
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's awesome.

832
01:16:38,584 --> 01:16:41,565
[SPEAKER_11]: But one thing I do remember from... I would car surf, and that was fun.

833
01:16:42,206 --> 01:16:46,427
[SPEAKER_11]: One thing I do remember from San Andreas was that the controls were a little...

834
01:16:47,476 --> 01:16:49,377
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a lot for like a little controller.

835
01:16:49,417 --> 01:16:54,840
[SPEAKER_11]: There's so much you can do in that game that the controls get a little convoluted because there's so much you can do with that controller.

836
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:59,803
[SPEAKER_11]: And I imagine if you can lay that out across a keyboard, it probably makes it a little more... No, same.

837
01:16:59,943 --> 01:17:00,683
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you think?

838
01:17:01,063 --> 01:17:02,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yes and no.

839
01:17:03,304 --> 01:17:09,268
[SPEAKER_05]: For the plane missions, having a joystick is very handy, except they made it so incredibly touchy on the plane stuff.

840
01:17:09,588 --> 01:17:13,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you'll just tap it and you'll automatically go craning towards the ground.

841
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:15,111
[SPEAKER_24]: It's like playing Top Gun on the NES.

842
01:17:15,431 --> 01:17:15,531
[SPEAKER_24]: It's

843
01:17:16,197 --> 01:17:17,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly!

844
01:17:17,862 --> 01:17:18,946
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all about the trainers.

845
01:17:21,314 --> 01:17:30,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's what I'm interested in because I remember watching you play Grand Theft Auto Vice City on the computer and there was that code where you could hit a button and you'd make a car rain down.

846
01:17:30,416 --> 01:17:35,256
[SPEAKER_07]: No, basically what it was, it was I set one button, special moves.

847
01:17:35,336 --> 01:17:38,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually there's a code where you can do make all the cars explode.

848
01:17:38,897 --> 01:17:42,298
[SPEAKER_07]: So I mapped that to one key, held it down, and all the cars rocket into the air.

849
01:17:42,358 --> 01:17:45,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you let go and start running and dodge the falling debris.

850
01:17:45,578 --> 01:17:46,078
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.

851
01:17:46,098 --> 01:17:46,938
[SPEAKER_05]: See, that's the kind of cool stuff.

852
01:17:46,958 --> 01:17:50,279
[SPEAKER_05]: You can drop like tanks and then you just keep doing a line of tanks.

853
01:17:50,379 --> 01:17:52,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, tanks, that big tank pile.

854
01:17:52,641 --> 01:17:58,185
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the kind of cool stuff that you can do in a game on the PC that's a little harder on PlayStation.

855
01:17:58,225 --> 01:18:04,330
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, they have a lot of these same codes on PlayStation, but you can do more config and hacking and all that stuff on the PC.

856
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:06,451
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that's the real reason to be happy about it.

857
01:18:06,471 --> 01:18:07,152
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's quite funny?

858
01:18:07,272 --> 01:18:12,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Up to maybe last month or so, they were still releasing new codes for Grand Theft Auto, like in-game codes.

859
01:18:12,756 --> 01:18:15,437
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's a good way to keep your game going, you know, keep it alive a little bit.

860
01:18:15,577 --> 01:18:16,958
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I gotta go back and play.

861
01:18:17,118 --> 01:18:20,779
[SPEAKER_05]: The chatroom's talking about the sex minigame.

862
01:18:20,819 --> 01:18:25,701
[SPEAKER_05]: You always have where you can edit it and change it and add stuff to it.

863
01:18:25,961 --> 01:18:34,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I was seeing, I saw today on, what was it, on X-Play, they were talking about Grand Theft Auto Vice City, the two-player missions, you can make out with guys in that.

864
01:18:34,984 --> 01:18:35,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, hooray.

865
01:18:37,005 --> 01:18:40,125
[SPEAKER_22]: They're talking about having a mini sex game in the PC version.

866
01:18:40,145 --> 01:18:43,526
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura said the word sex, so I was interested here for a minute.

867
01:18:43,586 --> 01:18:45,787
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't found out how to do it.

868
01:18:45,847 --> 01:18:47,887
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been trying to find out how to do it.

869
01:18:48,207 --> 01:18:50,088
[SPEAKER_11]: What is up with the mini sex games lately?

870
01:18:50,128 --> 01:18:52,368
[SPEAKER_11]: We had one in Fable, we had one in God of War.

871
01:18:53,008 --> 01:18:54,829
[SPEAKER_11]: It was written into the code, but disabled.

872
01:18:54,949 --> 01:18:55,729
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just funny.

873
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:59,592
[SPEAKER_07]: It's written in the code, but disabled for the PS2 version.

874
01:18:59,932 --> 01:19:07,518
[SPEAKER_07]: So if they just transferred that over to the PC, I'm sure someone will be able to find the way to, you know, get rid of that so you can actually have sex.

875
01:19:07,678 --> 01:19:08,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Who cares?

876
01:19:08,499 --> 01:19:08,999
[SPEAKER_07]: It's stupid.

877
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:12,382
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, have you ever watched, you know, the hooker have sex with you in the car?

878
01:19:12,763 --> 01:19:14,924
[SPEAKER_07]: All it is is the car rocking and she's sitting there.

879
01:19:15,245 --> 01:19:15,725
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just great.

880
01:19:16,583 --> 01:19:20,104
[SPEAKER_05]: You can always do the really old sex joke in playing River City Ransom.

881
01:19:20,224 --> 01:19:23,545
[SPEAKER_05]: You walk behind the girls in the mall and make it look like you're humping them from behind.

882
01:19:23,686 --> 01:19:25,946
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, can you post those pictures in our chatroom, DarkSakura?

883
01:19:25,966 --> 01:19:26,787
[SPEAKER_11]: They might get a kick out of that.

884
01:19:26,807 --> 01:19:27,947
[SPEAKER_11]: I think those are fake.

885
01:19:27,967 --> 01:19:28,567
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they fake?

886
01:19:29,147 --> 01:19:29,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

887
01:19:30,208 --> 01:19:30,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, they are fake.

888
01:19:31,128 --> 01:19:32,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, man, you had me going for a minute.

889
01:19:32,849 --> 01:19:33,409
[SPEAKER_11]: They are funny.

890
01:19:33,949 --> 01:19:34,429
[SPEAKER_11]: Post them anyway.

891
01:19:34,769 --> 01:19:35,049
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

892
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:40,431
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Reznor, we've got to let you go because we're going to get to a song premiere that the Dance Game folks really want to hear.

893
01:19:40,451 --> 01:19:40,691
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem.

894
01:19:40,711 --> 01:19:41,692
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll definitely move aside for this.

895
01:19:41,932 --> 01:19:42,212
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

896
01:19:42,252 --> 01:19:43,452
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you have a good one, all right?

897
01:19:43,872 --> 01:19:44,173
[SPEAKER_05]: You too.

898
01:19:44,193 --> 01:19:44,393
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

899
01:19:44,413 --> 01:19:44,853
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for calling.

900
01:19:44,933 --> 01:19:45,113
[SPEAKER_11]: Later.

901
01:19:46,505 --> 01:19:48,725
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, this is interesting.

902
01:19:48,805 --> 01:19:55,327
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we've got folks that are tuning in that aren't used to the dance game stuff, so we've got to talk about the other stuff too, but that's alright.

903
01:19:55,627 --> 01:19:56,327
[SPEAKER_11]: I like all games.

904
01:19:56,527 --> 01:19:58,187
[SPEAKER_11]: We're game fans first, dance games second.

905
01:19:58,347 --> 01:20:00,387
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's talk about those dance games.

906
01:20:00,427 --> 01:20:05,368
[SPEAKER_11]: We promised you about now we'd be talking about the brand new DDR Ultramix 3 song.

907
01:20:05,428 --> 01:20:12,810
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I told you guys earlier that Miklatov, even though he's here, you might have forgot he was here because he's actually been playing the Blue DS over there.

908
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:13,770
[SPEAKER_11]: He can't stop playing.

909
01:20:14,330 --> 01:20:15,310
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi Miklatov, how you doing?

910
01:20:18,624 --> 01:20:20,906
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, DarkSakura says the second one.

911
01:20:20,966 --> 01:20:24,489
[SPEAKER_22]: I did a little bit of digging on this, and apparently it's a mod you download.

912
01:20:24,609 --> 01:20:26,010
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

913
01:20:26,271 --> 01:20:29,813
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get to the dance thing, though, because they're impatient as it is.

914
01:20:30,054 --> 01:20:30,314
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

915
01:20:31,235 --> 01:20:35,038
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though Mikotov here, he is not revealing this to you guys.

916
01:20:35,698 --> 01:20:39,582
[SPEAKER_11]: He's under NDA, so he can't talk about it.

917
01:20:39,882 --> 01:20:46,528
[SPEAKER_11]: But who can talk about it, and who can talk about when their songs are in the games, are the artists themselves.

918
01:20:47,228 --> 01:20:55,071
[SPEAKER_11]: And sure enough, if you remember last year when DDR Ultramix 2 was coming out, we had TOY, I believe, on his website.

919
01:20:55,131 --> 01:20:56,731
[SPEAKER_11]: He had announced he was doing songs for DDR.

920
01:20:57,732 --> 01:21:01,333
[SPEAKER_11]: Alien613 or whoever had announced they were doing a song for DDR.

921
01:21:01,813 --> 01:21:03,934
[SPEAKER_11]: And they put the background of the song on their site.

922
01:21:03,994 --> 01:21:05,134
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know how they got that.

923
01:21:07,235 --> 01:21:12,597
[SPEAKER_11]: Mikotov, do you remember any other folks that announced their songs on their website before the rest of us found out about it?

924
01:21:13,911 --> 01:21:18,655
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you're all dying to find out what the song is, but I want to remind you real quick.

925
01:21:38,724 --> 01:21:43,086
[SPEAKER_11]: This ties into an ongoing theme we've had going on for a couple weeks here on this show.

926
01:21:43,386 --> 01:21:44,987
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki just found it on the page here.

927
01:21:45,027 --> 01:21:45,748
[SPEAKER_11]: He's laughing.

928
01:21:47,368 --> 01:21:51,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, what is the theme that it's tying into here on the show?

929
01:21:53,030 --> 01:22:00,634
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, I can't troll me with that stuff because I'm so very sad.

930
01:22:02,395 --> 01:22:04,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you feeling tragic?

931
01:22:04,816 --> 01:22:09,519
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so tragic, oh my god, I am so tragic.

932
01:22:09,839 --> 01:22:11,420
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my tortured existence.

933
01:22:11,620 --> 01:22:20,465
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, if you haven't figured it out yet, the theme that this song relates to is our gothic talking that we've been doing for the past few weeks here.

934
01:22:20,805 --> 01:22:23,947
[SPEAKER_22]: The artist... Because girls' butts have a lot to do with being goth.

935
01:22:23,967 --> 01:22:26,389
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, everybody in our chat room was rooting for girls' butts.

936
01:22:26,489 --> 01:22:27,029
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, guys.

937
01:22:27,049 --> 01:22:28,450
[SPEAKER_11]: This actually ties into another joke.

938
01:22:29,071 --> 01:22:30,712
[SPEAKER_11]: I couldn't believe it when I found this.

939
01:22:30,772 --> 01:22:33,774
[SPEAKER_11]: The artist that is doing this song is called Spray.

940
01:22:34,094 --> 01:22:36,355
[SPEAKER_11]: And the song is called I Am Gothic.

941
01:22:36,455 --> 01:22:39,357
[SPEAKER_11]: And they are claiming on their website... I'm going to quote from their website.

942
01:22:39,758 --> 01:22:50,245
[SPEAKER_11]: Their site is over at www.spraynet.freeserve.co.uk slash news.html And I quote from the page.

943
01:22:52,026 --> 01:22:53,588
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a section here that says DDR.

944
01:22:54,149 --> 01:23:08,245
[SPEAKER_11]: Whilst Spray's dream of soundtracking something by Ultimate play the game may never materialize, we have the genuinely exciting news that DDR Ultramix 3 on the Xbox will feature I Am Gothic, the 2003 single mix.

945
01:23:10,387 --> 01:23:12,848
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have a song by the artist Spray called I Am Gothic.

946
01:23:12,868 --> 01:23:13,649
[SPEAKER_11]: We're gonna play them.

947
01:23:13,809 --> 01:23:15,630
[SPEAKER_11]: It's actually available on the internet.

948
01:23:15,650 --> 01:23:16,950
[SPEAKER_11]: We got it off iTunes.

949
01:23:17,270 --> 01:23:18,511
[SPEAKER_11]: You can buy the song on iTunes.

950
01:23:19,211 --> 01:23:22,293
[SPEAKER_11]: We're gonna play it for you guys right now, I guess.

951
01:23:22,513 --> 01:23:23,073
[SPEAKER_11]: You ready for this?

952
01:23:23,513 --> 01:23:25,294
[SPEAKER_11]: Now remember, this is not the DDR edit.

953
01:23:25,314 --> 01:23:28,015
[SPEAKER_11]: This song is actually kind of long.

954
01:23:28,336 --> 01:23:32,698
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember that this song is going to be edited down for DDR when they actually put it in the game.

955
01:23:33,418 --> 01:23:37,320
[SPEAKER_11]: So this song actually clocks in at 6 minutes and 30 seconds, so it's a little bit long.

956
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:43,564
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think if you listen to it, you can kind of tell what parts will be in the game.

957
01:23:44,384 --> 01:23:46,625
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't have to be Miklatov to know that.

958
01:23:46,645 --> 01:23:47,726
[SPEAKER_11]: You will probably be able to guess.

959
01:23:47,766 --> 01:23:57,712
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, here it is, the Orange Lounge Radio premiere of a brand new song announced by the artist on their website for DDR Ultramix 3, Spray, I Am Gothic.

960
01:27:01,872 --> 01:27:15,005
[SPEAKER_26]: It's no clue, I'm a freak, I don't like your bands I don't put any effort in, it's just how I am I'm disturbed, I feel hurt, I'm intense, that's me Writing poetry, it's indefinite

961
01:27:48,796 --> 01:27:50,325
Thank you for watching!

962
01:28:20,141 --> 01:28:20,903
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm a loner

963
01:30:12,776 --> 01:30:23,965
[SPEAKER_11]: The world premiere here on Orange Lounge Radio of that brand new song from DDR Ultramix 3 as announced by the artist on their website Spray with I Am Gothic, the 2003 single mix.

964
01:30:26,334 --> 01:30:27,374
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so there you have it.

965
01:30:27,815 --> 01:30:33,917
[SPEAKER_11]: Now remember that that song, if you thought it was a little long, don't forget that they do edit those songs down when they're put into DDR.

966
01:30:34,777 --> 01:30:42,920
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, if you thought it was long, don't worry, they're going to cut out some of the extra parts there and just have the meat of the song in the game.

967
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:45,061
[SPEAKER_11]: So, Loki, what did you think?

968
01:30:45,381 --> 01:30:45,961
[SPEAKER_11]: I am gothic.

969
01:30:46,282 --> 01:30:46,882
[SPEAKER_11]: It was okay.

970
01:30:47,462 --> 01:30:47,702
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah?

971
01:30:48,042 --> 01:30:48,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay?

972
01:30:48,702 --> 01:30:49,003
[SPEAKER_28]: It was okay.

973
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:51,680
[SPEAKER_28]: It's okay.

974
01:30:51,920 --> 01:31:03,964
[SPEAKER_11]: I was laughing my ass off when I found out about this a little earlier this week because just because of how it fits into everything we've been talking about on the show lately, I was cracking up.

975
01:31:04,164 --> 01:31:04,964
[SPEAKER_28]: We're psychic.

976
01:31:05,664 --> 01:31:09,105
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, the Artist Spray, I actually think they are very funny.

977
01:31:09,465 --> 01:31:12,286
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the interesting thing about the band Spray.

978
01:31:12,826 --> 01:31:17,808
[SPEAKER_11]: I was kind of perusing through their website where they announced this fact that they're going to be in DDR Ultramix 3.

979
01:31:18,488 --> 01:31:19,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

980
01:31:43,027 --> 01:31:44,328
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, so, wait, am I right here?

981
01:31:44,388 --> 01:31:46,430
[SPEAKER_11]: Ricky and Daz were Space Cats who were a bus stop.

982
01:31:46,450 --> 01:31:46,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, exactly.

983
01:31:47,070 --> 01:31:47,230
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

984
01:31:47,511 --> 01:31:48,191
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, here's the deal.

985
01:31:48,592 --> 01:31:56,318
[SPEAKER_11]: Ricky, it says Ricardo, who is one of the folks that's in this band, Spray, is one half of pop production legends Ricky and Daz.

986
01:31:57,591 --> 01:31:59,212
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, you weren't a big fan of the song or...

987
01:32:22,528 --> 01:32:29,840
[SPEAKER_11]: It's alright, it's just generic Well don't forget that it's going to get cut down a little bit as well So it'll be even more generic?

988
01:32:30,501 --> 01:32:33,325
[SPEAKER_11]: No, but the parts that go on and on will be cut down

989
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:37,622
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't care for much of it, honestly.

990
01:32:37,662 --> 01:32:38,382
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, it was okay.

991
01:32:38,442 --> 01:32:40,463
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd listen to it in the background, but I've heard better.

992
01:32:40,664 --> 01:32:46,428
[SPEAKER_11]: We found out Skulk pretty early last year, too, and that turned out to be one of the best songs.

993
01:32:58,680 --> 01:32:59,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

994
01:33:06,952 --> 01:33:09,914
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the lyrics in the song, let me read you some of the lyrics from I Am Gothic.

995
01:33:10,254 --> 01:33:12,956
[SPEAKER_11]: Step inside, candlelights in my depressing gloom.

996
01:33:13,437 --> 01:33:16,439
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just no brooding teen, I'm considered abstruse.

997
01:33:17,099 --> 01:33:19,621
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so sparse being dark, can't you feel my pain?

998
01:33:19,661 --> 01:33:21,923
[SPEAKER_11]: People are all the same, they isolate my ways.

999
01:33:22,483 --> 01:33:25,706
[SPEAKER_11]: Catch the ghost train to the center of my heart, then the dark will rise again.

1000
01:33:26,086 --> 01:33:28,668
[SPEAKER_11]: I am potent, I am profound, then the clouds will part.

1001
01:33:28,728 --> 01:33:29,348
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the chorus.

1002
01:33:29,849 --> 01:33:32,611
[SPEAKER_11]: I am gothic, I am pale, I am scary, I'm insane.

1003
01:33:32,751 --> 01:33:35,813
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a loner, I am cold, I feel special when people don't phone.

1004
01:33:36,397 --> 01:33:36,977
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay!

1005
01:33:37,518 --> 01:33:39,259
[SPEAKER_11]: So I can't get it.

1006
01:33:39,319 --> 01:33:49,605
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it like they're satirized, being satirized, satire of goth bands or are they poking fun at themselves or what?

1007
01:33:49,665 --> 01:33:50,425
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1008
01:33:50,705 --> 01:33:59,911
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's just a satire because anything that's synth pop is now seeming to be labeled as goth and they are definitely synth pop so they might be making fun of that.

1009
01:34:00,211 --> 01:34:00,752
[SPEAKER_11]: IKILLWITHMYCAR

1010
01:34:20,001 --> 01:34:21,022
[SPEAKER_11]: Read a lyric.

1011
01:34:21,322 --> 01:34:22,963
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to hear a lyric from I Kill With My Car?

1012
01:34:23,363 --> 01:34:32,008
[SPEAKER_11]: Rubber on tarmac, grip the wheel, cold chrome heartbeat, stainless steel, come on baby, take that step, in front of me in certain death, I kill with my car.

1013
01:34:34,550 --> 01:34:37,491
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there's another great song on there called Fashion Stigmata.

1014
01:34:38,472 --> 01:34:39,833
[SPEAKER_11]: Fashion Stigmata is great.

1015
01:34:40,865 --> 01:34:52,099
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause it has singing children in it Yeah, little British children that sing Let me play, I guess I'll play little clips of these songs here real quick Let me play like a little clip of I Kill With My Car here So you guys can get a feel for this

1016
01:35:08,820 --> 01:35:18,724
[SPEAKER_11]: You see where that... I don't know, it strikes me as like... I want to see an old woman driving a car with that blaring on... They're poking fun at the goth thing, but they're goth themselves!

1017
01:35:19,404 --> 01:35:20,885
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's like, they're just... I don't know.

1018
01:35:21,145 --> 01:35:23,986
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Jamie said something when she was in here earlier that kind of seemed to make sense.

1019
01:35:24,026 --> 01:35:27,067
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, they are making fun of how people make fun of goths.

1020
01:35:27,427 --> 01:35:28,047
[SPEAKER_11]: Or something, I don't know.

1021
01:35:29,608 --> 01:35:34,470
[SPEAKER_11]: Other song titles on the CD, I Keep Missing the Love Boat, and Leave It to the Girls, Boys.

1022
01:35:38,354 --> 01:35:39,895
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the clip I'll try and get a clip

1023
01:36:13,704 --> 01:36:14,585
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so there you go.

1024
01:36:15,065 --> 01:36:16,086
[SPEAKER_07]: I just can't get into this.

1025
01:36:16,766 --> 01:36:17,547
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't get into it?

1026
01:36:17,747 --> 01:36:20,489
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I like the titles, but I just can't get into the songs.

1027
01:36:20,669 --> 01:36:21,189
[SPEAKER_07]: They're awful.

1028
01:36:21,850 --> 01:36:23,631
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we had to look... It's like an Uyvul movie.

1029
01:36:23,671 --> 01:36:24,291
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, come on.

1030
01:36:24,351 --> 01:36:25,472
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like... Oh, that's harsh.

1031
01:36:25,492 --> 01:36:26,733
[SPEAKER_07]: That is harsh.

1032
01:36:26,933 --> 01:36:29,575
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a good concept, but executed poorly.

1033
01:36:31,478 --> 01:36:39,327
[SPEAKER_11]: What's great is that they have a song called Child of the 80s, which is very similar to the I Am Gothic song because it's like poking fun at like, you know, reminiscing of the 80s and everything.

1034
01:36:39,847 --> 01:36:46,314
[SPEAKER_11]: And we could have sworn when we were listening to the song for the first time that it was saying suddenly everybody rapes me because I'm a child of the 80s.

1035
01:36:46,634 --> 01:36:47,836
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's actually rates me.

1036
01:36:47,916 --> 01:36:49,858
[SPEAKER_11]: It's where that little accent comes into play.

1037
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:52,461
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1038
01:36:53,669 --> 01:36:54,890
[SPEAKER_11]: So there you go, there you have it.

1039
01:36:55,010 --> 01:36:55,771
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope you enjoyed.

1040
01:36:56,471 --> 01:36:56,932
[SPEAKER_11]: Check them out.

1041
01:36:57,092 --> 01:37:02,296
[SPEAKER_11]: I personally recommend the band Spray, but it really depends on what you want.

1042
01:37:03,678 --> 01:37:07,501
[SPEAKER_11]: Miklatov, I don't know, is there anything you can tell us further about Spray?

1043
01:37:07,581 --> 01:37:10,624
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably not, but only personal thoughts on the band.

1044
01:37:11,264 --> 01:37:14,327
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're my new echo image, which means they're awesome.

1045
01:37:14,467 --> 01:37:15,968
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can't say anything about them in the game, huh?

1046
01:37:17,209 --> 01:37:17,709
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

1047
01:37:17,729 --> 01:37:18,409
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

1048
01:37:41,838 --> 01:37:42,639
[SPEAKER_11]: But it makes sense.

1049
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:46,341
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I don't know if this is like a different drum, because they're technically not on the different drum label.

1050
01:37:46,361 --> 01:37:50,484
[SPEAKER_11]: They're on this Ninth Wave Records, I think it was Ninth Wave, I want to say was the name of the label.

1051
01:37:50,504 --> 01:37:51,784
[SPEAKER_11]: They're on some different type of record label.

1052
01:37:52,425 --> 01:37:59,069
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's technically not a different drum, so it makes me think it's a licensed song, and you can't tell me, you're no help as to which one it is.

1053
01:37:59,529 --> 01:38:11,197
[SPEAKER_11]: But I kind of see, if it is a licensed song, if we're following that little six degrees of DDR here, going from Bus Stop to Space Cats to Ricky and Daz to Spray, it makes sense.

1054
01:38:11,597 --> 01:38:14,178
[SPEAKER_11]: How we ended up from point A to point B. So, there we go.

1055
01:38:16,358 --> 01:38:16,638
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1056
01:38:18,419 --> 01:38:20,699
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm curious what our chatroom folks thought of that.

1057
01:38:21,339 --> 01:38:22,179
[SPEAKER_11]: They probably hate it.

1058
01:38:22,879 --> 01:38:23,560
[SPEAKER_11]: They're fickle.

1059
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:28,241
[SPEAKER_11]: Some folks were saying... They were talking about Max in there.

1060
01:38:28,481 --> 01:38:28,821
[SPEAKER_19]: What?

1061
01:38:31,501 --> 01:38:33,002
[SPEAKER_11]: We did not pay attention, chatroom.

1062
01:38:33,022 --> 01:38:35,142
[SPEAKER_11]: People don't come to the chatroom to actually listen to the show.

1063
01:38:35,202 --> 01:38:37,183
[SPEAKER_11]: They go there to talk about other stuff.

1064
01:38:38,823 --> 01:38:39,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

1065
01:38:42,658 --> 01:38:45,619
[SPEAKER_11]: This reminds me of Bloodhound Gang's Discovery Channel song.

1066
01:38:45,699 --> 01:38:46,379
[SPEAKER_11]: Who said that?

1067
01:38:46,919 --> 01:38:48,319
[SPEAKER_11]: Reznor, this guy that just called us earlier.

1068
01:38:48,339 --> 01:38:49,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I don't know who he is.

1069
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:51,840
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess I can't make fun of him if I don't know who he is.

1070
01:38:51,860 --> 01:38:56,741
[SPEAKER_11]: But you did say earlier when we were listening to this album in the car, you said it sounded like Eiffel 65.

1071
01:38:56,781 --> 01:38:57,861
[SPEAKER_11]: Who did a remix of that song?

1072
01:38:58,061 --> 01:39:02,362
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the songs, the very first track on the CD, sounds a lot like Eiffel 65.

1073
01:39:02,462 --> 01:39:08,003
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not a bad thing because if you got over Blue and you actually had their CD, it was a pretty good CD.

1074
01:39:10,684 --> 01:39:10,924
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1075
01:39:12,213 --> 01:39:12,813
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, DarkSakura.

1076
01:39:13,813 --> 01:39:16,614
[SPEAKER_11]: You missed our chat about the band... Good.

1077
01:39:17,154 --> 01:39:18,434
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they have a song.

1078
01:39:18,454 --> 01:39:19,875
[SPEAKER_11]: I was waiting for you.

1079
01:39:20,435 --> 01:39:24,076
[SPEAKER_22]: I was busy holding back the flood and getting two of every animal.

1080
01:39:25,176 --> 01:39:25,376
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1081
01:39:27,437 --> 01:39:27,777
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it.

1082
01:39:28,157 --> 01:39:30,557
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a song called I Kill With My Car.

1083
01:39:30,917 --> 01:39:31,398
[SPEAKER_22]: I need that.

1084
01:39:31,758 --> 01:39:32,458
[SPEAKER_22]: See?

1085
01:39:32,618 --> 01:39:33,778
[SPEAKER_22]: He was telling me about it.

1086
01:39:34,358 --> 01:39:36,519
[SPEAKER_11]: I knew she would come around as soon as she found out about that.

1087
01:39:36,539 --> 01:39:37,479
[SPEAKER_22]: Your roommate was telling me about it.

1088
01:39:40,011 --> 01:39:42,013
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry listeners, but I have to do this for Jamie.

1089
01:39:42,113 --> 01:39:43,475
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to play the clip again you guys.

1090
01:39:43,935 --> 01:39:44,476
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to do this.

1091
01:39:44,976 --> 01:39:45,777
[SPEAKER_24]: Send this to me.

1092
01:39:46,598 --> 01:39:47,178
[SPEAKER_26]: I like this.

1093
01:40:03,217 --> 01:40:04,558
[SPEAKER_22]: I like this a whole lot.

1094
01:40:04,638 --> 01:40:05,238
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, I need that.

1095
01:40:05,258 --> 01:40:08,780
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe it's just the remix, because that was a remix, the one that's going to be in DER.

1096
01:40:08,900 --> 01:40:10,681
[SPEAKER_22]: It sounded too sandstormy.

1097
01:40:11,121 --> 01:40:13,242
[SPEAKER_06]: The original version of the song is amazing.

1098
01:40:13,703 --> 01:40:16,664
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very, what did you say in the car, Edward Scissorhands?

1099
01:40:16,744 --> 01:40:19,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because the beginning of the song sounds like Edward Scissorhands.

1100
01:40:19,686 --> 01:40:21,127
[SPEAKER_22]: I like music that sounds like a suicide.

1101
01:40:23,568 --> 01:40:24,268
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the original.

1102
01:40:24,288 --> 01:40:25,449
[SPEAKER_11]: It sounds like Edward Scissorhands to me.

1103
01:40:28,095 --> 01:40:31,218
[SPEAKER_11]: Now Reznor is suggesting in our chatroom that you should just name your car Killer.

1104
01:40:31,258 --> 01:40:32,379
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll name it Silver Death.

1105
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:33,600
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1106
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, enough about the band Spray.

1107
01:40:35,461 --> 01:40:36,402
[SPEAKER_11]: We've whored them out enough.

1108
01:40:36,723 --> 01:40:39,245
[SPEAKER_11]: We hope they enjoy their 15 minutes while being in DDR.

1109
01:40:39,565 --> 01:40:40,065
[SPEAKER_11]: But you know what?

1110
01:40:41,066 --> 01:40:44,069
[SPEAKER_11]: Really, I haven't heard an album that made me laugh and just...

1111
01:40:45,603 --> 01:40:46,684
[SPEAKER_11]: I just really liked it.

1112
01:40:46,824 --> 01:40:47,384
[SPEAKER_11]: I really did.

1113
01:40:47,444 --> 01:40:49,025
[SPEAKER_11]: It's everything I like about music.

1114
01:40:49,125 --> 01:40:50,886
[SPEAKER_11]: It was synth pop and it was funny.

1115
01:40:51,006 --> 01:40:52,467
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, seriously, how can you go wrong?

1116
01:40:52,807 --> 01:40:59,610
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a song about, it sounded like being a stalker and then committing suicide and killing the other guy as well so you could be together forever.

1117
01:41:00,270 --> 01:41:01,551
[SPEAKER_06]: That was pretty awesome.

1118
01:41:04,449 --> 01:41:05,990
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, let's go to a break.

1119
01:41:06,050 --> 01:41:09,633
[SPEAKER_11]: And in this break, I'm in a very Akira mood this break.

1120
01:41:09,733 --> 01:41:13,616
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think we need to do some Akira Yamaoka this break.

1121
01:41:13,676 --> 01:41:16,158
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to do that, and then we're going to come back and get into tonight's cage match.

1122
01:41:16,478 --> 01:41:19,020
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll take another call on Skype if anybody's willing to call in.

1123
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:21,422
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll take a poll and chat and see if somebody wants to call in on Skype.

1124
01:41:21,642 --> 01:41:27,827
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll take your calls, get to the cage match, get to the FUs of the week, and all the other gaming news we can dig up after this break.

1125
01:41:28,267 --> 01:41:28,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Akira!

1126
01:42:04,082 --> 01:42:04,824
Thank you for watching!

1127
01:43:29,384 --> 01:43:32,061
Thanks for watching!

1128
01:45:01,955 --> 01:45:02,755
Thanks for watching!

1129
01:45:31,121 --> 01:45:31,782
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks for watching!

1130
01:46:36,787 --> 01:46:38,149
Thanks for watching!

1131
01:47:08,194 --> 01:47:11,476
We've just got to forever, the brain grass blows and the wind is dancing

1132
01:47:30,143 --> 01:47:31,224
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for watching!

1133
01:47:51,124 --> 01:47:51,944
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for watching!

1134
01:48:08,610 --> 01:48:09,791
Thank you for watching!

1135
01:48:47,956 --> 01:48:51,660
[SPEAKER_11]: Orange Lounge Radio We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it

1136
01:48:57,148 --> 01:49:20,187
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello everybody, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, we are here, and if you missed it, you missed it, we premiered a brand new song from DDR Ultramix 3, it was Spray, I am Gothic, and we were talking about the band Spray for a little while, and maybe at the very, very end, after the afterbirth, we'll play it one more time for those of you guys that missed it, so stick with us and we'll play it again for those of you guys that missed it.

1137
01:49:21,860 --> 01:49:22,540
[SPEAKER_11]: Is your mic on?

1138
01:49:23,161 --> 01:49:34,568
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also reminded people on DDR Freak that, you know, because I told them what it was, and I reminded them that they can listen to it also on our rewinds that are on Friday on DDR Freak Radio.

1139
01:49:34,768 --> 01:49:35,709
[SPEAKER_11]: Very nice.

1140
01:49:35,789 --> 01:49:36,249
[SPEAKER_11]: Good plug.

1141
01:49:36,369 --> 01:49:45,975
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, the rewind for this week won't show up until next Friday because there was a boo-boo and one of our shows got skipped, or

1142
01:49:46,536 --> 01:49:47,296
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1143
01:50:06,305 --> 01:50:07,888
[SPEAKER_11]: I swear we weren't.

1144
01:50:07,928 --> 01:50:08,690
[SPEAKER_11]: We really weren't.

1145
01:50:10,153 --> 01:50:17,067
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know how long... Spray doesn't have dates as to when they do updates on their site, so we don't know when they put that up there, but...

1146
01:50:18,038 --> 01:50:19,078
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably wasn't that long ago.

1147
01:50:19,298 --> 01:50:20,699
[SPEAKER_07]: I figured out the connection, too.

1148
01:50:21,179 --> 01:50:22,179
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, what is the connection?

1149
01:50:22,199 --> 01:50:32,321
[SPEAKER_07]: The connection is that the record label, which is quite small, called Ninth Day or something, Ninth Something Records.

1150
01:50:32,681 --> 01:50:41,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, they're a teeny, teeny, tiny label, and they only have a few artists, which all have really horrible webpages, except for Spray.

1151
01:50:41,643 --> 01:50:44,464
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're actually sold by...

1152
01:50:45,985 --> 01:50:47,466
[SPEAKER_07]: None other than a different drum.

1153
01:50:48,546 --> 01:50:50,126
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, so I think you found the connection there then.

1154
01:50:50,566 --> 01:50:51,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

1155
01:50:51,807 --> 01:50:52,107
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1156
01:50:52,647 --> 01:50:54,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Which means it's probably not a licensed song.

1157
01:50:55,368 --> 01:50:59,009
[SPEAKER_11]: Since if we ask Miklatov, he'll just say NDA, which could mean yes.

1158
01:50:59,469 --> 01:51:01,130
[SPEAKER_11]: He's grabbing for a microphone.

1159
01:51:01,770 --> 01:51:01,970
Was I?

1160
01:51:02,030 --> 01:51:03,090
[SPEAKER_19]: I was grabbing for a microphone.

1161
01:51:03,130 --> 01:51:05,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you look like you're grabbing for a microphone.

1162
01:51:05,691 --> 01:51:06,431
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you're a stylist.

1163
01:51:06,451 --> 01:51:06,831
[SPEAKER_11]: Never mind.

1164
01:51:07,031 --> 01:51:07,511
[SPEAKER_11]: Screw you.

1165
01:51:08,292 --> 01:51:09,152
[SPEAKER_11]: Why are you even here?

1166
01:51:11,373 --> 01:51:12,673
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, Miklatov, he wants a mic.

1167
01:51:14,215 --> 01:51:18,838
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here because I wanted to get drunk last night, and I succeeded.

1168
01:51:21,260 --> 01:51:22,341
[SPEAKER_06]: He drunk himself black.

1169
01:51:25,243 --> 01:51:25,603
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1170
01:51:26,543 --> 01:51:27,524
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, you were going to say something?

1171
01:51:29,485 --> 01:51:32,588
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that someone needs to make a mention of the times for the rewind.

1172
01:51:34,449 --> 01:51:37,551
[SPEAKER_11]: I would love to, but I think it's 6 o'clock, I think.

1173
01:51:38,985 --> 01:51:40,408
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know very well.

1174
01:51:40,609 --> 01:51:41,190
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what, though?

1175
01:51:41,270 --> 01:51:45,559
[SPEAKER_11]: I will check DDR Freak's schedule just for you guys right now and have a look-see.

1176
01:51:46,581 --> 01:51:49,948
[SPEAKER_11]: In the meantime, DarkSakura, if you want to plug some other shows that we have on Orange Launch Radio.

1177
01:51:50,874 --> 01:51:52,074
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I'd like to plug one.

1178
01:51:52,094 --> 01:51:52,794
[SPEAKER_22]: Where's my gun?

1179
01:51:52,894 --> 01:52:04,496
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I mean... I do public volume on Tuesdays with a music request show, except no one requests anything except randomly going, We want to hear this song!

1180
01:52:04,576 --> 01:52:06,897
[SPEAKER_22]: And I don't have it, so I tell you to send it to me.

1181
01:52:07,417 --> 01:52:09,337
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh yeah, back to the show.

1182
01:52:09,417 --> 01:52:11,278
[SPEAKER_22]: Pre-show starts at a quarter to seven.

1183
01:52:11,538 --> 01:52:12,738
[SPEAKER_22]: Official time is seven.

1184
01:52:13,238 --> 01:52:14,398
[SPEAKER_22]: Show starts at 7.30.

1185
01:52:14,798 --> 01:52:18,499
[SPEAKER_22]: I go to 10.30 supposedly, except I've been kind of going overboard

1186
01:52:19,099 --> 01:52:19,760
[SPEAKER_22]: I play a lot of good music.

1187
01:52:30,464 --> 01:52:31,805
[SPEAKER_22]: It isn't necessarily a video game.

1188
01:52:55,902 --> 01:52:57,443
[SPEAKER_11]: That doesn't involve any of us.

1189
01:52:57,803 --> 01:53:03,507
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it's being worked on, and we're waiting to see what it sounds like to see if it's airable.

1190
01:53:05,468 --> 01:53:06,569
[SPEAKER_11]: But it should be interesting.

1191
01:53:06,629 --> 01:53:08,230
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we should play it even if it's not airable.

1192
01:53:08,250 --> 01:53:09,771
[SPEAKER_11]: Either way, it should be interesting.

1193
01:53:09,931 --> 01:53:13,534
[SPEAKER_22]: And there's also another show that I brought up.

1194
01:53:13,734 --> 01:53:14,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you mentioned this before.

1195
01:53:15,775 --> 01:53:19,578
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm moving to a new house, so it won't be there for a couple of weeks.

1196
01:53:20,739 --> 01:53:24,981
[SPEAKER_22]: But there will be a show hosted by Dan, as in my Dan.

1197
01:53:26,182 --> 01:53:27,804
[SPEAKER_22]: and his crazy GameStop buddies.

1198
01:53:28,665 --> 01:53:30,287
[SPEAKER_10]: That should be very interesting.

1199
01:53:30,307 --> 01:53:31,328
[SPEAKER_10]: GameStop talk!

1200
01:53:32,088 --> 01:53:41,438
[SPEAKER_22]: It's going to basically be a when the new stuff comes out his show goes up, he can get it that day and play it for you even early.

1201
01:53:42,243 --> 01:53:44,925
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going to be very cool, so something to look forward to.

1202
01:53:45,546 --> 01:53:50,889
[SPEAKER_11]: So we are branching out, because I know my new show is going to be General Gaming as well, and that's going to be very exciting, his show.

1203
01:53:51,029 --> 01:53:58,875
[SPEAKER_11]: We've also talked about other things, but... There is definitely coming something to the station as soon as next week that's very exciting.

1204
01:53:59,355 --> 01:54:02,818
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not a live talk show, it's something else, but it's very exciting nonetheless.

1205
01:54:03,639 --> 01:54:04,360
[SPEAKER_11]: I think so anyway.

1206
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:04,900
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be fun.

1207
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:06,482
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a fun show, if nothing else.

1208
01:54:06,762 --> 01:54:15,592
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm doing a special show later on, too, that's going to be fun and have nothing to do with our normal shows, but it just fits because it's nerdy and geeky.

1209
01:54:15,712 --> 01:54:17,073
[SPEAKER_07]: It's old school nerdy.

1210
01:54:17,133 --> 01:54:18,755
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, like, old, old school.

1211
01:54:19,416 --> 01:54:22,039
[SPEAKER_07]: So it should be a lot of fun and a little retro there.

1212
01:54:22,219 --> 01:54:27,201
[SPEAKER_11]: So actually, for those of you that like old school, you are going to love the announcement we have this week.

1213
01:54:27,321 --> 01:54:28,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully this week it's done.

1214
01:54:28,562 --> 01:54:29,843
[SPEAKER_11]: You are going to love this announcement.

1215
01:54:29,863 --> 01:54:31,243
[SPEAKER_11]: You will poo your pants.

1216
01:54:31,523 --> 01:54:32,404
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe not, but maybe.

1217
01:54:32,544 --> 01:54:32,964
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good.

1218
01:54:33,444 --> 01:54:33,804
[SPEAKER_11]: It's great.

1219
01:54:34,645 --> 01:54:36,186
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, anyway, so enough talking.

1220
01:54:36,326 --> 01:54:40,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and I was going to mention, our website's awesome.

1221
01:54:40,608 --> 01:54:41,528
[SPEAKER_07]: You should go check it out.

1222
01:54:41,588 --> 01:54:45,930
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, we've got a story now about Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories with pictures.

1223
01:54:46,270 --> 01:54:47,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's right, pictures.

1224
01:54:47,871 --> 01:54:51,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Rockstar is ripping them off other people's sites, but not us, because we rock.

1225
01:54:52,193 --> 01:54:53,634
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have pictures for you.

1226
01:54:53,794 --> 01:54:54,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Go check them out.

1227
01:54:54,774 --> 01:54:55,315
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty.

1228
01:54:56,415 --> 01:54:59,457
[SPEAKER_22]: We also have the final pictures from Friday at E3.

1229
01:55:01,078 --> 01:55:01,778
[SPEAKER_22]: They're all up too.

1230
01:55:02,599 --> 01:55:03,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Am I in any of them?

1231
01:55:04,540 --> 01:55:05,380
[SPEAKER_22]: No, but a slime is.

1232
01:55:06,861 --> 01:55:09,302
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I finally got up off my ass and put up all the galleries.

1233
01:55:09,342 --> 01:55:11,883
[SPEAKER_11]: So how many pictures total from E3 did you have?

1234
01:55:13,204 --> 01:55:15,205
[SPEAKER_22]: About, what, 700 something?

1235
01:55:16,586 --> 01:55:18,067
[SPEAKER_22]: Let me take a look.

1236
01:55:18,127 --> 01:55:18,947
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll add them up.

1237
01:55:19,908 --> 01:55:20,328
[SPEAKER_22]: Wait a moment.

1238
01:55:21,653 --> 01:55:22,219
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you very much.

1239
01:55:24,077 --> 01:55:25,238
[SPEAKER_22]: You can talk about how awesome I am.

1240
01:55:26,239 --> 01:55:29,682
[SPEAKER_22]: You are... I am such a whore for the camera.

1241
01:55:29,942 --> 01:55:30,722
[SPEAKER_11]: Mostly awesome.

1242
01:55:31,063 --> 01:55:31,503
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just kidding.

1243
01:55:32,264 --> 01:55:38,749
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought your story earlier was really funny about, because you came in here and you said, I was Noah and I had to collect two of everything and clean up the flood.

1244
01:55:39,209 --> 01:55:43,633
[SPEAKER_11]: You were actually being serious because my roommate spilled a gallon of water on the floor in the kitchen.

1245
01:55:44,193 --> 01:55:46,515
[SPEAKER_11]: So she really was gone during the whole spray thing.

1246
01:55:46,855 --> 01:55:48,977
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I was getting sprayed.

1247
01:55:48,997 --> 01:55:51,058
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, my roommate sprayed water all over the floor.

1248
01:55:51,719 --> 01:55:52,459
So it works.

1249
01:55:53,540 --> 01:55:56,784
[SPEAKER_11]: These are the kind of hints you're supposed to do before the songs are announced, people.

1250
01:56:05,064 --> 01:56:07,966
[SPEAKER_11]: and Thursday... Which, by the way, like 20 of them are the PS3.

1251
01:56:08,726 --> 01:56:14,569
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you can check out the PlayStation 3 from like every conceivable angle because DarkSakura got it all.

1252
01:56:14,649 --> 01:56:20,332
[SPEAKER_22]: I put five pictures of the... five of the best pictures on the story that I did, which I'll go back and link in the chat room.

1253
01:56:21,692 --> 01:56:25,234
[SPEAKER_22]: Just an overview of... Yeah, all the PS3 stuff is on Fridays.

1254
01:56:25,614 --> 01:56:28,896
[SPEAKER_22]: Gunstar Superheroes, Magic Online, Kingdom Hearts, that's all Thursday.

1255
01:56:28,916 --> 01:56:29,276
[SPEAKER_22]: I have 263 images.

1256
01:56:31,657 --> 01:56:32,579
[SPEAKER_22]: and various stuff.

1257
01:56:32,839 --> 01:56:38,608
[SPEAKER_22]: I also got the new Dead to Rights for PSP on the Thursday one.

1258
01:56:39,749 --> 01:56:42,513
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh crap, I just lost the page.

1259
01:56:42,734 --> 01:56:43,895
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, there we go.

1260
01:56:44,236 --> 01:56:46,078
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, this is brilliant radio here.

1261
01:56:47,039 --> 01:56:49,941
[SPEAKER_07]: and then for... Rob, where are your pictures?

1262
01:56:50,441 --> 01:56:51,062
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not up yet.

1263
01:56:51,082 --> 01:56:53,363
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just about to say, my pictures are still not up yet.

1264
01:56:53,423 --> 01:56:55,244
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't take quite nearly as many as Jamie.

1265
01:56:55,284 --> 01:56:56,705
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I had maybe about 100 total.

1266
01:56:56,725 --> 01:56:57,345
[SPEAKER_22]: 273 for Wednesday.

1267
01:56:57,365 --> 01:56:59,646
[SPEAKER_22]: Including pictures of army parachuting.

1268
01:57:05,990 --> 01:57:10,793
[SPEAKER_11]: But what I do have in my picture gallery that I will be putting up soon is I have pictures of booth babes.

1269
01:57:11,253 --> 01:57:15,595
[SPEAKER_11]: Because nothing says love into those booth babes like a gay man running around E3 with a camera.

1270
01:57:15,936 --> 01:57:17,316
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can look forward to that.

1271
01:57:17,536 --> 01:57:19,017
[SPEAKER_22]: I have something that tops that.

1272
01:57:19,237 --> 01:57:19,598
[SPEAKER_11]: What's that?

1273
01:57:19,838 --> 01:57:21,859
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a sexy picture of Shane.

1274
01:57:22,879 --> 01:57:23,280
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you?

1275
01:57:24,140 --> 01:57:24,640
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I do.

1276
01:57:24,980 --> 01:57:26,281
[SPEAKER_11]: A sexy picture of Shane?

1277
01:57:26,361 --> 01:57:29,103
[SPEAKER_11]: If you ever want to know what Miklatov looked like, you can go to the gallery right now.

1278
01:57:29,123 --> 01:57:31,844
[SPEAKER_07]: There's actually a full page of PlayStation 3.

1279
01:57:32,264 --> 01:57:33,045
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty funny.

1280
01:57:33,785 --> 01:57:34,626
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh wow, there really is.

1281
01:57:35,618 --> 01:57:37,340
[SPEAKER_22]: It's kind of blurry.

1282
01:57:37,660 --> 01:57:39,002
[SPEAKER_22]: You're doing a thumbs up.

1283
01:57:43,807 --> 01:57:45,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob also has another picture.

1284
01:57:45,289 --> 01:57:48,433
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a sexy picture of me hugging Mario.

1285
01:57:50,515 --> 01:57:53,198
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a story from E3, actually.

1286
01:57:53,739 --> 01:57:56,322
[SPEAKER_22]: How Dan scared the living shit out of Miyamoto.

1287
01:57:57,591 --> 01:57:58,051
[SPEAKER_09]: How's that?

1288
01:57:58,212 --> 01:58:12,803
[SPEAKER_22]: He got up with this thing to be autographed, and just as Miyamoto was getting up to leave, see, he puts his hand on his shoulder, and he gives him this look of utter horror, and then Dan goes, thumbs up with a big old grin, and then he started laughing.

1289
01:58:13,383 --> 01:58:14,204
[SPEAKER_22]: So, yeah, he signed down.

1290
01:58:14,244 --> 01:58:14,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

1291
01:58:15,085 --> 01:58:15,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways.

1292
01:58:16,706 --> 01:58:16,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1293
01:58:17,246 --> 01:58:17,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1294
01:58:17,947 --> 01:58:18,588
[SPEAKER_09]: New subject, yes?

1295
01:58:19,168 --> 01:58:19,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1296
01:58:19,588 --> 01:58:20,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go.

1297
01:58:20,209 --> 01:58:20,609
[SPEAKER_09]: New subject.

1298
01:58:20,629 --> 01:58:21,830
[SPEAKER_09]: How about the cage match, boys and girls?

1299
01:58:22,090 --> 01:58:22,591
[SPEAKER_11]: How about?

1300
01:58:22,851 --> 01:58:23,131
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1301
01:58:23,912 --> 01:58:24,172
[SPEAKER_27]: Woo-hoo.

1302
01:58:27,351 --> 01:58:31,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Tonight's cage match, The Way It Works, three songs put into battle.

1303
01:58:31,435 --> 01:58:45,926
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys in the chatroom get to vote for your favorite song, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Mamadi Music and Video Game Program, which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, on this stream when we are not here.

1304
01:58:46,026 --> 01:58:52,752
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, the song that is the current victor is a song that has been in the victory circle for two weeks now.

1305
01:58:53,112 --> 01:58:54,412
[SPEAKER_11]: It's halfway to retirement.

1306
01:58:54,733 --> 01:58:56,333
[SPEAKER_11]: We haven't had a retired song in quite a while.

1307
01:58:56,373 --> 01:59:01,695
[SPEAKER_11]: So this might be, I'm sure Jamie would be thrilled being the fangirl that she is to get this song retired.

1308
01:59:02,375 --> 01:59:04,655
[SPEAKER_11]: But it has to happen with your guys' help.

1309
01:59:05,276 --> 01:59:09,497
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, Loki and I are going to do our best to take it out.

1310
01:59:10,404 --> 01:59:13,485
[SPEAKER_28]: So, yeah, we'll see.

1311
01:59:13,545 --> 01:59:13,886
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1312
01:59:14,446 --> 01:59:14,766
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1313
01:59:14,806 --> 01:59:17,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Tonight, I know what I picked, and I know that you're very last minute.

1314
01:59:18,248 --> 01:59:21,809
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think we're going to be giving this song much competition tonight, but you never know.

1315
01:59:22,330 --> 01:59:22,630
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1316
01:59:22,710 --> 01:59:23,210
[SPEAKER_11]: So here it is.

1317
01:59:23,730 --> 01:59:25,671
[SPEAKER_11]: Song number one, a clip of last week's winner.

1318
01:59:25,691 --> 01:59:27,892
[SPEAKER_11]: You only get to hear a clip because you've heard this song already.

1319
01:59:28,332 --> 01:59:32,534
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the Gorillaz, and the song is their next single from the album Demon Days.

1320
01:59:32,934 --> 01:59:33,795
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Dare.

1321
02:01:32,340 --> 02:01:33,144
[SPEAKER_20]: It's there.

1322
02:01:58,926 --> 02:02:04,571
[SPEAKER_11]: Alrighty, that was song number one, two weeks, going for a third win tonight, Gorillaz with Dare.

1323
02:02:05,152 --> 02:02:09,896
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, we don't get to rate that song, we're going right into the next one, because it already won, so you already know it's good.

1324
02:02:10,316 --> 02:02:21,386
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, the next song is my pick, and I'm being really adventurous with my pick tonight, because I really think that you guys are going to kind of be really weird with this one.

1325
02:02:21,926 --> 02:02:25,709
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, I don't know what to say, like...

1326
02:02:26,670 --> 02:02:36,741
[SPEAKER_11]: This artist is somebody I would never consider putting in the cage match, but the production values on this song are surprisingly really good.

1327
02:02:37,301 --> 02:02:43,347
[SPEAKER_11]: And to take a person like this, and to produce a song that is...

1328
02:02:44,315 --> 02:02:45,796
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of infectious in a way.

1329
02:02:45,916 --> 02:02:46,956
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of impressive to me.

1330
02:02:47,016 --> 02:02:50,237
[SPEAKER_11]: So therefore I'm giving it a cage match spin to see what you guys think of it.

1331
02:02:50,857 --> 02:02:53,979
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was co-written by the chick from Four Non Blondes, which I think is cool.

1332
02:02:54,259 --> 02:02:55,159
[SPEAKER_11]: So, because she's cool.

1333
02:02:55,399 --> 02:02:56,259
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so here it is.

1334
02:02:56,920 --> 02:02:58,820
[SPEAKER_11]: The artist, brace yourself.

1335
02:02:58,860 --> 02:03:00,921
[SPEAKER_11]: Now don't hate this song just after I say the artist.

1336
02:03:01,501 --> 02:03:02,922
[SPEAKER_11]: The artist is Kelly Osbourne.

1337
02:03:03,882 --> 02:03:05,963
[SPEAKER_11]: And this song is One Word.

1338
02:03:06,323 --> 02:03:06,623
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay?

1339
02:03:07,023 --> 02:03:07,924
[SPEAKER_11]: So give it a chance.

1340
02:03:08,044 --> 02:03:10,105
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't hate it just yet because it's kind of dancey.

1341
02:03:10,485 --> 02:03:10,965
[SPEAKER_11]: Check it out.

1342
02:03:11,025 --> 02:03:13,606
[SPEAKER_11]: Kelly Osbourne, One Word, here on the cage match.

1343
02:03:19,642 --> 02:03:21,382
[SPEAKER_11]: See, even my computer doesn't want to play it here.

1344
02:03:21,422 --> 02:03:22,583
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's try this again, kids.

1345
02:03:23,243 --> 02:03:26,284
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Kelly Osbourne with One Word here in the Cage Match.

1346
02:03:27,804 --> 02:03:28,064
One Word

1347
02:03:51,713 --> 02:03:52,554
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

1348
02:04:20,700 --> 02:04:47,445
[SPEAKER_20]: The silence tells me all I need to know One word, one word Tells me everything I need to know One world driven into madness Madness driven by the depths below One word, one word Tells me everything I need

1349
02:05:06,574 --> 02:05:31,641
[SPEAKER_20]: One lie tells of thousands of years The greatest stories that were ever told One lie, one lie Tells the greatest stories ever told Once man can predict the future A future journey into outer space One fan, one fan

1350
02:05:35,467 --> 02:05:37,529
[SPEAKER_20]: A future journey into outer space

1351
02:06:04,679 --> 02:06:10,242
It's not the way that I want it, it's just the way that I need it Day after day, day after day

1352
02:07:27,823 --> 02:07:32,445
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, that was song number two in tonight's cage match, Kelly Osbourne, One Word.

1353
02:07:33,285 --> 02:07:36,226
[SPEAKER_11]: And now we get one vote from each person.

1354
02:07:36,286 --> 02:07:38,907
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, not a vote, but one judgment.

1355
02:07:39,007 --> 02:07:40,928
[SPEAKER_11]: One judgment from each person here in the room.

1356
02:07:41,168 --> 02:07:44,949
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura.

1357
02:07:45,589 --> 02:07:49,811
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I heard this in your car last week, and I liked it.

1358
02:07:50,051 --> 02:07:50,911
[SPEAKER_22]: It's okay.

1359
02:07:51,031 --> 02:07:52,692
[SPEAKER_22]: It is, though, really repetitive.

1360
02:07:53,612 --> 02:07:53,752
[SPEAKER_22]: And...

1361
02:07:55,960 --> 02:08:00,265
[SPEAKER_22]: She doesn't really sound like herself through all the synth and everything, which I guess might be a blessing in disguise.

1362
02:08:00,926 --> 02:08:01,427
[SPEAKER_11]: I think so.

1363
02:08:03,649 --> 02:08:05,632
[SPEAKER_22]: It would be a background song for me, honestly.

1364
02:08:05,732 --> 02:08:06,353
[SPEAKER_22]: I give it a...

1365
02:08:09,313 --> 02:08:10,953
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm being really nice to give a seven.

1366
02:08:11,574 --> 02:08:14,135
[SPEAKER_11]: Me personally, I think it's great.

1367
02:08:14,255 --> 02:08:22,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Kelly Osbourne, okay, the rock thing really didn't work for her, so she can't sing so well, so let's find a genre that fits perfectly for people who can't sing that well.

1368
02:08:23,199 --> 02:08:25,340
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's revive 80s new wave, it works great.

1369
02:08:26,440 --> 02:08:28,141
[SPEAKER_11]: So I like it, so I give it an eight for 80s.

1370
02:08:29,142 --> 02:08:34,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, she needs to get her dad to fucking sing with her, because at least that would be cool.

1371
02:08:35,485 --> 02:08:35,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly.

1372
02:08:36,494 --> 02:08:39,884
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a music file of Ozzy Osbourne doing Stayin' Alive

1373
02:08:40,296 --> 02:08:41,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, that was fucking awesome.

1374
02:08:41,797 --> 02:08:42,097
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard that.

1375
02:08:42,117 --> 02:08:42,657
[SPEAKER_07]: That was great.

1376
02:08:42,737 --> 02:08:42,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

1377
02:08:43,017 --> 02:08:44,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, hello, Cade, I gotta bring that in.

1378
02:08:44,878 --> 02:08:47,379
[SPEAKER_07]: All aboard the disco chain!

1379
02:08:47,459 --> 02:08:47,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

1380
02:08:48,040 --> 02:08:48,780
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm bringing that in.

1381
02:08:48,820 --> 02:08:50,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, one word, one word.

1382
02:08:50,381 --> 02:08:50,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, one word?

1383
02:08:50,801 --> 02:08:51,141
[SPEAKER_07]: One song.

1384
02:08:51,441 --> 02:08:52,161
[SPEAKER_07]: It was okay.

1385
02:08:52,421 --> 02:08:56,443
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just kind of, it was, it was very, um, boring.

1386
02:08:57,344 --> 02:08:59,405
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't like Kelly Osbourne at all.

1387
02:08:59,965 --> 02:09:02,386
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, it was just kind of, eh.

1388
02:09:02,566 --> 02:09:05,187
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just, I don't know.

1389
02:09:05,207 --> 02:09:09,009
[SPEAKER_07]: She could keep doing that same genre because it's not as bad as, like, say, I don't know, um,

1390
02:09:10,140 --> 02:09:15,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Lala, or something like that, you know, I know that's not Kelly Osbourne, but just as bad, and trying to be rocked.

1391
02:09:16,104 --> 02:09:18,646
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you make me wanna la la, that one?

1392
02:09:18,666 --> 02:09:28,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, this 80s, not 80s, this pop rock crap that they're doing now, not good, okay, it's crap, but it's good to see you're going in a new direction, so I guess I give it a 7.

1393
02:09:28,953 --> 02:09:30,114
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1394
02:09:30,234 --> 02:09:32,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Miklatov, something you can talk about tonight, for once.

1395
02:09:33,176 --> 02:09:34,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Kelly Osbourne, one word.

1396
02:09:34,477 --> 02:09:37,720
[SPEAKER_06]: It was okay, um, kind of boring, I think that's the theme.

1397
02:09:38,700 --> 02:09:38,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, 6.

1398
02:09:40,524 --> 02:09:40,905
[SPEAKER_11]: All righty.

1399
02:09:41,486 --> 02:09:42,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get into song number three.

1400
02:09:42,988 --> 02:09:46,773
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Loki's song, and he refuses to tell me the name, so he will be doing the introduction.

1401
02:09:46,813 --> 02:09:48,615
[SPEAKER_07]: So Sal will be doing the introduction.

1402
02:09:48,776 --> 02:09:50,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, this song, it's...

1403
02:09:51,084 --> 02:09:56,867
[SPEAKER_07]: I did two remixes today, one of them being a remix to Dropout, which we're not playing, and the other remix is to Skulk.

1404
02:09:56,887 --> 02:10:00,449
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Echo Image Skulk with, um, oh god, what the hell was the name of this?

1405
02:10:00,489 --> 02:10:00,729
[SPEAKER_07]: It was...

1406
02:10:19,449 --> 02:10:20,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody Understands Mix.

1407
02:10:20,771 --> 02:10:21,451
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it was.

1408
02:10:21,571 --> 02:10:24,054
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so this is Skulk, the Nobody Understands Mix.

1409
02:10:24,715 --> 02:10:25,195
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.

1410
02:10:25,315 --> 02:10:25,676
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1411
02:10:27,237 --> 02:10:29,219
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to talk about what you mixed it with later?

1412
02:10:29,740 --> 02:10:34,225
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot of different versions of Skulk put together and also some other songs and stuff.

1413
02:10:35,565 --> 02:10:42,970
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some things I would have loved to do to it that I couldn't do, and so, you know, I see all the flaws in it, you know, going into it, but it's... Way to sell it.

1414
02:10:43,410 --> 02:10:52,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I'm sorry, okay, because I don't want to just, you know, pop out mixes that are just something you're going to see on Bomani Style, you know, like some of the crap that's on there.

1415
02:10:52,577 --> 02:10:55,999
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm really picky on the stuff that I want to release out there on the internet.

1416
02:10:56,019 --> 02:10:58,701
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why the dropout thing is not ever getting released on the internet.

1417
02:10:59,521 --> 02:11:00,262
[SPEAKER_07]: But we'll hear that later.

1418
02:11:00,302 --> 02:11:05,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, this is Echo Image, Skulk, the No Ending Your Stands mix.

1419
02:11:08,566 --> 02:11:32,772
[SPEAKER_20]: The fragments of my soul Make me understand what I've become The falling like I always did Make me take control About the weakness, is it that You're leaving me to find what I have lost My heart beats with a boundless pain

1420
02:13:57,968 --> 02:13:59,129
Thank you for watching!

1421
02:15:19,033 --> 02:15:24,803
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, Loki there, remixing Echo Image with Skulk, the Nobody Understands mix.

1422
02:15:24,943 --> 02:15:30,592
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see if the judges, us, were able to understand it, or we just didn't get it.

1423
02:15:31,213 --> 02:15:31,614
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.

1424
02:15:32,981 --> 02:15:35,322
[SPEAKER_22]: It was overall good.

1425
02:15:36,562 --> 02:15:41,944
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that the music overshadowed, it was imbalanced versus the lyrics.

1426
02:15:42,944 --> 02:15:44,265
[SPEAKER_22]: It was actually pretty imbalanced.

1427
02:15:45,305 --> 02:15:56,749
[SPEAKER_22]: I thought that the beat itself on the first measure could have, at the beginning of every measure, could have been a little bit more subdued because I started getting headaches.

1428
02:15:57,049 --> 02:16:00,190
[SPEAKER_22]: Which is how I do it whenever any song does like that.

1429
02:16:00,270 --> 02:16:01,591
[SPEAKER_22]: It doesn't matter what song it is.

1430
02:16:02,569 --> 02:16:09,635
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, it was, though, solid with a little tweaking, it could be a 10, so I, for right now, give it a 7.5.

1431
02:16:11,317 --> 02:16:11,637
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki.

1432
02:16:12,338 --> 02:16:17,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Exact same thoughts, because I have the same problems trying to pull just, you know, vocals out of there.

1433
02:16:18,343 --> 02:16:22,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't really do that if I don't have a vocal track, but I work with what I got, so, you know, I give it a 9.

1434
02:16:24,029 --> 02:16:42,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I, you know, I would think that Loki and Echo Image colliding would be like an instant 10, but for me, like, some of it was just like too busy, like the middle part of it was like too much, like I think I felt the Jamie thing was like, oh my god, there's like too much here, um, but I think for what he had to work with, Loki did an amazing job, I think what it is, is it's

1435
02:16:43,403 --> 02:16:53,267
[SPEAKER_11]: The beginning of a really, really good mix, and if Loki could get the original samples and stuff, he could clean it up a lot, and it would totally, like, just blow us all away.

1436
02:16:53,327 --> 02:17:12,275
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard because when you're working with, like, three or four different tracks at once, mixing them together on top, and only one has a vocal track, pulling the vocals out of there is impossible, and I've tried the best I could to, like, subdue the other tracks while I have a vocal track going, but it's, like, extremely, extremely hard to do, and that was, like, the best I can get after a couple hours today.

1437
02:17:12,529 --> 02:17:14,290
[SPEAKER_22]: I do have a piece of advice in general, though.

1438
02:17:14,691 --> 02:17:17,973
[SPEAKER_22]: You know those drum beats that get louder as they go?

1439
02:17:17,993 --> 02:17:19,654
[SPEAKER_22]: You use those quite a lot.

1440
02:17:19,694 --> 02:17:21,315
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I recognize that, too, in this song.

1441
02:17:21,355 --> 02:17:23,777
[SPEAKER_22]: You use that in every single mix!

1442
02:17:24,518 --> 02:17:25,839
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just temporary stuff.

1443
02:17:25,899 --> 02:17:26,239
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1444
02:17:26,599 --> 02:17:27,179
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what, though?

1445
02:17:27,500 --> 02:17:30,722
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a start to something absolutely brilliant.

1446
02:17:30,762 --> 02:17:32,223
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that a simple crescendo would be good.

1447
02:17:32,463 --> 02:17:34,825
[SPEAKER_11]: These people should be contacting you to remix their stuff.

1448
02:17:34,845 --> 02:17:34,825
7.5.

1449
02:17:34,965 --> 02:17:35,505
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, Mikotov.

1450
02:17:39,511 --> 02:17:48,979
[SPEAKER_06]: It reminded me a lot of the extended mix that is on Amazon.com that when people first heard about Skulk, they were downloading and thinking it was going to be in the game.

1451
02:17:50,160 --> 02:17:54,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Not overly fond of that one, but it was still decent nonetheless.

1452
02:17:54,484 --> 02:17:54,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Seven.

1453
02:17:56,245 --> 02:17:58,547
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's recap, kids.

1454
02:17:58,607 --> 02:17:59,928
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not up to us, it's up to you.

1455
02:17:59,948 --> 02:18:04,392
[SPEAKER_11]: Here are the three songs you get to vote for tonight in tonight's cage match.

1456
02:18:05,373 --> 02:18:07,715
[SPEAKER_11]: Song number one you can vote for tonight is Dare.

1457
02:18:18,415 --> 02:18:27,204
[SPEAKER_11]: And song number two you can vote for tonight is Kelly Osbourne with One Word.

1458
02:18:35,512 --> 02:18:43,219
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, and song number three you can vote for tonight is Echo Image, remixed by Loki, Skulk, the Nobody Understands mix.

1459
02:18:55,487 --> 02:18:57,870
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, place vote now.

1460
02:18:57,970 --> 02:19:06,079
[SPEAKER_11]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote for song number one, song number two, or song number three.

1461
02:19:06,159 --> 02:19:07,981
[SPEAKER_11]: Or you can call them by the artist or name.

1462
02:19:08,362 --> 02:19:09,143
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not retarded.

1463
02:19:09,163 --> 02:19:10,604
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be able to figure it out each way.

1464
02:19:10,765 --> 02:19:12,667
[SPEAKER_07]: We should play my other song since it's on the CD.

1465
02:19:13,027 --> 02:19:14,408
[SPEAKER_11]: We will get to that.

1466
02:19:15,288 --> 02:19:17,970
[SPEAKER_11]: However, I want to give you a chance to talk about what's going on in the synth scene.

1467
02:19:17,990 --> 02:19:18,930
[SPEAKER_07]: In the synth scene?

1468
02:19:19,650 --> 02:19:19,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing.

1469
02:19:20,991 --> 02:19:24,793
[SPEAKER_07]: And sadly enough, I wish I had something to talk about, but there is nothing.

1470
02:19:25,153 --> 02:19:28,715
[SPEAKER_07]: So instead, I'm going to talk about something else, and that's diverse systems, D9's coming out.

1471
02:19:29,335 --> 02:19:36,979
[SPEAKER_07]: I still haven't figured out a way to actually be able to order the rest of them, since their English page only goes up to D6, which I have everything from that back.

1472
02:19:38,300 --> 02:19:46,947
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I'm going to maybe try, because I hate experimenting with sending them money, especially since there's that language barrier there.

1473
02:19:47,667 --> 02:19:54,152
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to try to order something that's not on their order page, that's on the Japanese order page, and see if they send it anyways.

1474
02:19:55,893 --> 02:19:56,914
[SPEAKER_07]: And hopefully they do.

1475
02:19:57,214 --> 02:19:59,896
[SPEAKER_07]: If that's the case, because there's a lot of CDs I've got to catch up on.

1476
02:20:00,116 --> 02:20:06,541
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole D7, D8, and then since D9 was announced, and then there's, you know, was it Hello Mr...

1477
02:20:09,035 --> 02:20:09,435
[SPEAKER_07]: What was it?

1478
02:20:09,536 --> 02:20:14,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Desire and Hello Mr. Taka, I think, or something like that.

1479
02:20:14,399 --> 02:20:16,740
[SPEAKER_07]: So, those we still need to get.

1480
02:20:16,760 --> 02:20:24,665
[SPEAKER_07]: But they've announced the stuff for D9 already, and there's a lot of remixes from 9th and 10th style in it so far, so it should be interesting.

1481
02:20:25,866 --> 02:20:27,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so that's pretty much it for the sim scene.

1482
02:20:27,915 --> 02:20:28,516
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1483
02:20:51,542 --> 02:20:52,583
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura has something...

1484
02:21:08,641 --> 02:21:09,502
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura's WTF News

1485
02:21:29,822 --> 02:21:33,843
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't turn out to be as good as I thought it was going to be.

1486
02:21:34,323 --> 02:21:36,244
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a B-side remix of Dropout.

1487
02:21:36,464 --> 02:21:37,825
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really have a title for it.

1488
02:21:37,985 --> 02:21:39,005
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just kind of interesting.

1489
02:21:39,045 --> 02:21:44,627
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem with it is, for one, I couldn't do much with Dropout and the song.

1490
02:21:45,047 --> 02:21:51,529
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I slowed the first song down to be about Dropout speed, it didn't sound right.

1491
02:21:52,649 --> 02:21:57,351
[SPEAKER_07]: You can listen to it, it's okay, but it's never going to be on the internet to download.

1492
02:21:57,451 --> 02:22:00,332
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is the dropout B-side mix, I guess.

1493
02:22:00,492 --> 02:22:05,294
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess, because it's about, it's like, you know, like how we did, what was it, Acid that one time?

1494
02:22:05,834 --> 02:22:11,736
[SPEAKER_07]: It was an okay remix, it's not anything I'd be proud of or like be out there, you know, say, hey, look at what I did.

1495
02:22:12,036 --> 02:22:18,999
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just like kind of, okay, I did it, you know, I started it, I finished it, just to get it done, so then, you know, moving on.

1496
02:22:19,019 --> 02:22:19,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this on the MySpace?

1497
02:22:20,632 --> 02:22:20,752
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1498
02:22:20,972 --> 02:22:21,152
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1499
02:22:21,733 --> 02:22:23,494
[SPEAKER_11]: Plug your MySpace, though, for folks that are into this.

1500
02:22:23,555 --> 02:22:35,245
[SPEAKER_07]: If they liked your Echo Image Mix and they liked this... If they like the Echo Image Mix, when it's done, finally, it will be on my MySpace page, which is myspace.com slash LokiFusion, all one word.

1501
02:22:35,765 --> 02:22:36,506
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can check it out.

1502
02:22:37,046 --> 02:22:38,507
[SPEAKER_07]: How many friends do you have now?

1503
02:22:38,768 --> 02:22:40,369
[SPEAKER_07]: I have about 17 friends.

1504
02:22:40,429 --> 02:22:40,849
[SPEAKER_13]: Woo-hoo!

1505
02:22:41,410 --> 02:22:43,632
[SPEAKER_07]: People that I've... They're just random people.

1506
02:22:43,832 --> 02:22:44,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

1507
02:22:44,272 --> 02:22:44,973
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of neat.

1508
02:22:45,673 --> 02:22:48,415
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, Myspace.com slash LokiFusion.

1509
02:22:48,475 --> 02:22:49,096
[SPEAKER_07]: You can check it out.

1510
02:22:49,116 --> 02:22:50,517
[SPEAKER_07]: I made a little cool banner for it.

1511
02:22:50,637 --> 02:22:54,820
[SPEAKER_07]: And my page doesn't look too bad, so it's pretty nice.

1512
02:22:54,860 --> 02:22:55,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Check it out.

1513
02:22:55,721 --> 02:23:00,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now we've got the Ecstasy remix, because that's my favorite.

1514
02:23:00,804 --> 02:23:09,410
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got the Battle Without Honor or Humanity, the 88 Severed Limbs mix, which is on there.

1515
02:23:09,450 --> 02:23:13,633
[SPEAKER_07]: We also have, which some people are saying they couldn't find before, the Radical Faith...

1516
02:23:15,681 --> 02:23:17,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Judgment Mix, I think is what I called it.

1517
02:23:18,064 --> 02:23:18,925
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's on there as well.

1518
02:23:19,165 --> 02:23:19,906
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so check it out.

1519
02:23:19,946 --> 02:23:20,327
[SPEAKER_11]: Here it is.

1520
02:23:21,068 --> 02:23:22,129
[SPEAKER_11]: Premiere of Dropout.

1521
02:23:22,149 --> 02:23:25,213
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably the only time you'll hear this.

1522
02:23:25,273 --> 02:23:26,814
[SPEAKER_11]: Dropout, the B-side mix by Loki.

1523
02:23:26,975 --> 02:23:27,155
[SPEAKER_11]: Enjoy.

1524
02:25:13,035 --> 02:25:15,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Why I'm not going to put that on the internet.

1525
02:25:15,797 --> 02:25:16,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Loki?

1526
02:25:16,497 --> 02:25:19,159
[SPEAKER_07]: I said, you can see why I'm not going to put that up on the internet.

1527
02:25:19,219 --> 02:25:21,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the folks in the chatroom kind of dug that one.

1528
02:25:22,121 --> 02:25:22,501
[SPEAKER_07]: It's okay.

1529
02:25:22,981 --> 02:25:25,182
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nothing I'd be proud of.

1530
02:25:25,202 --> 02:25:25,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1531
02:25:25,963 --> 02:25:26,243
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1532
02:25:29,585 --> 02:25:35,109
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, while I tally up the cage moach, make cage moach, cage match votes over here.

1533
02:25:35,129 --> 02:25:35,930
[SPEAKER_11]: Love that cage moach.

1534
02:25:36,050 --> 02:25:37,071
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, love that cage moach.

1535
02:25:37,931 --> 02:25:46,258
[SPEAKER_11]: She is going to bring you the WTF report where, you know, it's just a story that you could only find somewhere out there on the internet.

1536
02:25:46,298 --> 02:25:50,141
[SPEAKER_11]: So, DarkSakura, what do you have to share with us in the WTF report?

1537
02:25:51,517 --> 02:26:03,831
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, there's an article, actually I found this on DDR Freak, but it was on Yahoo News about an international robotics show that they do in Japan.

1538
02:26:05,212 --> 02:26:08,136
[SPEAKER_22]: It's at the Aichi World Expo in Nagagude.

1539
02:26:10,359 --> 02:26:22,784
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, they had a humanoid robot with a skin-like substance, a working mouthful torso, it moves as though it's breathing, it sits and acts as a tour guide.

1540
02:26:23,684 --> 02:26:31,807
[SPEAKER_22]: But apparently the robot was so realistic looking that they were pretty much afraid of it.

1541
02:26:31,827 --> 02:26:33,908
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, what does this represent for the future?

1542
02:26:33,928 --> 02:26:35,789
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm going to post a link to...

1543
02:26:37,369 --> 02:26:41,012
[SPEAKER_22]: There's actually a good slideshow from the whole thing, so I'm going to post this picture.

1544
02:26:41,492 --> 02:26:42,673
[SPEAKER_22]: And you should look through the slideshow.

1545
02:26:42,713 --> 02:26:44,894
[SPEAKER_22]: They have ballroom dancing robots.

1546
02:26:45,394 --> 02:26:47,535
[SPEAKER_22]: They have robots that will do your kitchen deeds for you.

1547
02:26:47,595 --> 02:26:52,899
[SPEAKER_22]: They show pictures of the bomb squad robots, which I've actually, they have employed in Israel already.

1548
02:26:53,519 --> 02:26:58,342
[SPEAKER_07]: The question that everybody wants to know, though, was she a pleasure model?

1549
02:27:00,583 --> 02:27:01,184
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what?

1550
02:27:02,825 --> 02:27:03,185
[SPEAKER_22]: Shut up.

1551
02:27:04,020 --> 02:27:04,940
[SPEAKER_07]: I've actually seen this.

1552
02:27:04,960 --> 02:27:07,041
[SPEAKER_07]: This was on Engadget earlier this week.

1553
02:27:07,061 --> 02:27:07,881
[SPEAKER_07]: It was pretty cool.

1554
02:27:08,782 --> 02:27:10,722
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole thing about the robots too.

1555
02:27:10,762 --> 02:27:16,484
[SPEAKER_07]: They had a caption contest for the picture with the two ballroom dancing robots and that was funny.

1556
02:27:17,464 --> 02:27:20,525
[SPEAKER_11]: What are these strange looking gloves the robot has on her hands?

1557
02:27:20,585 --> 02:27:22,266
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it's to prevent those types of things.

1558
02:27:22,346 --> 02:27:22,806
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1559
02:27:23,655 --> 02:27:25,256
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe her hands are just not finished yet.

1560
02:27:25,496 --> 02:27:29,217
[SPEAKER_22]: But you know, the thing is that I saw this and I was thinking about the movie that I saw last night.

1561
02:27:30,078 --> 02:27:31,078
[SPEAKER_22]: iRobot or what?

1562
02:27:31,678 --> 02:27:31,858
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

1563
02:27:32,338 --> 02:27:50,766
[SPEAKER_22]: I went to go see, well I don't want to spoil it because it's going to be on Syfy in a couple months, but I went to see Bruce Campbell showing his new movie, doing like a 40 theater tour in the United States of a film he did in Bulgaria.

1564
02:27:51,326 --> 02:27:53,747
[SPEAKER_22]: Call of the Man with the Screaming Brain, based on the Dark Horse comics.

1565
02:27:54,927 --> 02:28:04,671
[SPEAKER_22]: But the thing is that it's hard for me to say this because there is an android moment in the movie, and the robot just made me flashback since I saw it last night.

1566
02:28:04,711 --> 02:28:08,992
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what that robot reminds me of, and it's completely not having to do with robots at all?

1567
02:28:09,492 --> 02:28:17,075
[SPEAKER_07]: It reminds me of this really crappy Japanese show called Hey Mikey, where it's all... Hey Mikey was done like Thunderbirds was.

1568
02:28:17,635 --> 02:28:19,316
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all with mannequins.

1569
02:28:19,657 --> 02:28:23,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Not, you know, like the little puppets or whatever.

1570
02:28:23,519 --> 02:28:26,481
[SPEAKER_07]: We're talking full-size mannequins and it was creepy as hell.

1571
02:28:27,462 --> 02:28:29,103
[SPEAKER_07]: I gotta buy that DVD.

1572
02:28:29,283 --> 02:28:30,824
[SPEAKER_11]: That was kind of like today's special.

1573
02:28:30,864 --> 02:28:32,766
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate to bring up the Nickelodeon thing two weeks in a row.

1574
02:28:32,786 --> 02:28:33,446
[SPEAKER_11]: I love today's special.

1575
02:28:33,486 --> 02:28:35,327
[SPEAKER_11]: But today's special was the mannequins were coming to life.

1576
02:28:35,347 --> 02:28:36,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember the 80s movie, Mannequin?

1577
02:28:37,309 --> 02:28:40,451
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1578
02:28:40,511 --> 02:28:41,492
[SPEAKER_22]: Mannequin 2 was bad.

1579
02:28:42,492 --> 02:28:43,213
[SPEAKER_11]: Mannequin 2 was bad.

1580
02:28:43,233 --> 02:28:44,213
[SPEAKER_22]: The first one was actually kind of good.

1581
02:28:44,233 --> 02:28:44,314
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1582
02:28:45,452 --> 02:28:46,172
[SPEAKER_11]: How do you know they don't already?

1583
02:28:46,192 --> 02:28:47,033
[SPEAKER_22]: How do you know they don't already?

1584
02:28:47,053 --> 02:28:48,373
[SPEAKER_22]: How do you know they don't already?

1585
02:28:48,393 --> 02:28:49,753
[SPEAKER_11]: How do you know they don't already?

1586
02:29:11,411 --> 02:29:11,871
[SPEAKER_11]: Bad joke.

1587
02:29:12,812 --> 02:29:13,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the ferret lives among us.

1588
02:29:13,893 --> 02:29:17,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's how I know they don't already, because there's too many retarded people out there.

1589
02:29:18,857 --> 02:29:19,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly.

1590
02:29:19,718 --> 02:29:20,699
[SPEAKER_22]: Bad programming.

1591
02:29:20,759 --> 02:29:22,020
[SPEAKER_22]: They haven't got it right yet.

1592
02:29:22,200 --> 02:29:23,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe the robots are meant to do that.

1593
02:29:23,781 --> 02:29:27,004
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been programmed to make live to my sister.

1594
02:29:27,804 --> 02:29:28,505
[SPEAKER_22]: No, no, no, no.

1595
02:29:28,545 --> 02:29:33,469
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a difference between being a full-on physical robot and just being a walking automaton.

1596
02:29:33,789 --> 02:29:38,213
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, if they cloned a sheep first, maybe they will make a robot of the pleasure sheep first.

1597
02:29:39,366 --> 02:29:40,627
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

1598
02:29:40,867 --> 02:29:44,888
[SPEAKER_11]: Would having sex with a pleasure sheep be just as shameful as sex with a real sheep?

1599
02:29:45,148 --> 02:29:46,229
[SPEAKER_11]: I think more so.

1600
02:29:47,389 --> 02:29:48,950
[SPEAKER_11]: I love animals.

1601
02:29:49,010 --> 02:29:50,351
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's not a real sheep.

1602
02:29:51,091 --> 02:29:52,772
[SPEAKER_11]: Mikotov, you love sheep.

1603
02:29:53,932 --> 02:29:54,933
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you love animals?

1604
02:29:55,993 --> 02:29:58,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Sheep are one of my three phobias.

1605
02:29:59,094 --> 02:30:00,235
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really sad.

1606
02:30:00,895 --> 02:30:01,595
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the other two?

1607
02:30:01,795 --> 02:30:03,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Flying bugs in water.

1608
02:30:04,096 --> 02:30:05,277
[SPEAKER_22]: That's four then.

1609
02:30:06,843 --> 02:30:08,144
[SPEAKER_11]: Flying Bugs, Water, and Sheep.

1610
02:30:08,284 --> 02:30:08,724
[SPEAKER_24]: That's three.

1611
02:30:09,504 --> 02:30:11,025
[SPEAKER_24]: Flying Bugs, Water, and Sheep.

1612
02:30:11,065 --> 02:30:12,026
[SPEAKER_22]: Flying Bugs.

1613
02:30:12,226 --> 02:30:15,327
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, like those huge Brazilian cockroaches.

1614
02:30:16,588 --> 02:30:20,770
[SPEAKER_22]: You don't want to go into Alabama, though, because my mama got chased down the hall by a flying Brazilian cockroach.

1615
02:30:21,691 --> 02:30:22,371
[SPEAKER_22]: It was really nasty.

1616
02:30:22,471 --> 02:30:28,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, what happens, though, if you find a flying sheep that's insect-like and it happens to be sitting in a pond?

1617
02:30:28,314 --> 02:30:31,376
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's just got to be your worst nightmare right there.

1618
02:30:33,280 --> 02:30:35,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheap or tasty, that's all I gotta say.

1619
02:30:35,641 --> 02:30:38,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, lamburgers, mmm, yummy.

1620
02:30:38,601 --> 02:30:40,922
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait a minute, one of your fears is water, Miklatov?

1621
02:30:41,602 --> 02:30:42,082
[SPEAKER_11]: He's saying yes.

1622
02:30:42,342 --> 02:30:43,602
[SPEAKER_11]: Then I have to ask, how do I microfest this?

1623
02:30:43,622 --> 02:30:45,903
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to ask, what do you think of Ultramix 3's theme, then?

1624
02:30:46,003 --> 02:30:47,583
[SPEAKER_11]: Ha ha ha, bubbles!

1625
02:30:48,903 --> 02:30:49,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Stupid.

1626
02:30:51,884 --> 02:30:54,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, Ultramix 4, the theme's gonna be shiny lights.

1627
02:30:55,465 --> 02:30:58,005
[SPEAKER_07]: To pick up, you know, the mentally challenged audience.

1628
02:30:59,705 --> 02:31:02,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Because Ultramix 2, did it really have a theme?

1629
02:31:02,834 --> 02:31:03,154
[SPEAKER_11]: Blue.

1630
02:31:03,735 --> 02:31:04,715
[SPEAKER_11]: Blue was the theme.

1631
02:31:04,835 --> 02:31:05,836
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm sure that made you happy.

1632
02:31:05,856 --> 02:31:07,877
[SPEAKER_11]: The theme is dance game.

1633
02:31:08,078 --> 02:31:09,238
[SPEAKER_11]: This will be the ultimate theme.

1634
02:31:09,459 --> 02:31:15,162
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be bubbles, and then glitter, and then ecstasy.

1635
02:31:18,012 --> 02:31:20,193
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder how many of those Ultimix games will crank out, man.

1636
02:31:20,333 --> 02:31:20,813
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be crazy.

1637
02:31:21,433 --> 02:31:21,973
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, anyway.

1638
02:31:22,493 --> 02:31:24,894
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's talk about tonight's cage match winner, boys and girls.

1639
02:31:25,694 --> 02:31:31,956
[SPEAKER_11]: The winner of tonight's cage match... It was no small vote tonight, kids.

1640
02:31:32,016 --> 02:31:35,236
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys pretty much voted this one in somewhat of a landslide tonight.

1641
02:31:35,677 --> 02:31:38,717
[SPEAKER_11]: It was song number... Three.

1642
02:31:39,738 --> 02:31:41,778
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki remixing Echo Image.

1643
02:31:43,559 --> 02:31:44,879
[SPEAKER_11]: Skull, how did this win?

1644
02:31:46,055 --> 02:31:56,241
[SPEAKER_11]: Because our chat room has a huge boner for Echo Image, and they have a huge boner for you, so when you put two and two together, they can't contain it at their erection anymore, and it just comes all over the place.

1645
02:31:56,261 --> 02:31:59,383
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish that it would have lost so that I could put the good one in later.

1646
02:31:59,764 --> 02:32:00,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, well.

1647
02:32:00,084 --> 02:32:00,824
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's funny?

1648
02:32:01,085 --> 02:32:08,649
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to be bringing a different song for Cage Match, but I forgot my stupid flash drive that I have.

1649
02:32:08,990 --> 02:32:12,812
[SPEAKER_07]: And what's funny is I've tried to bring that song two times, and both times I've

1650
02:32:13,132 --> 02:32:13,512
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura

1651
02:32:32,058 --> 02:32:35,620
[SPEAKER_11]: Dark Knight in the chatroom is asking, has Loki's remixes ever took a loss?

1652
02:32:35,680 --> 02:32:37,520
[SPEAKER_11]: And I do recall that you did lose at least once.

1653
02:32:37,540 --> 02:32:38,341
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, a couple times.

1654
02:32:39,941 --> 02:32:40,862
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what it was, though.

1655
02:32:41,682 --> 02:32:43,743
[SPEAKER_11]: I am not a very good Orange Lounge Radio historian.

1656
02:32:44,443 --> 02:32:47,284
[SPEAKER_11]: DDR Angel, who hasn't been here for a couple weeks, I hope she's alright.

1657
02:32:47,724 --> 02:32:49,225
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm starting to worry now.

1658
02:32:49,245 --> 02:32:51,186
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to call the police if she doesn't come next week.

1659
02:32:52,306 --> 02:32:56,608
[SPEAKER_11]: But she's a very good historian of the show, so when I have questions like these, I can ask her.

1660
02:32:56,768 --> 02:32:59,569
[SPEAKER_07]: The last one, I think, was Legend of Trance 2005, maybe?

1661
02:33:03,917 --> 02:33:04,518
[SPEAKER_11]: F.U.s of the week

1662
02:33:25,563 --> 02:33:26,664
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll be back after this.

1663
02:33:26,684 --> 02:33:31,869
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to start off this break with some Akumajo Dracula medley from Keyboard Mania.

1664
02:33:31,909 --> 02:33:33,671
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll be back after this with the FUs of the week.

1665
02:33:33,711 --> 02:33:35,333
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to start sending those in right now, you can.

1666
02:33:35,393 --> 02:33:36,214
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll be back after this.

1667
02:35:23,395 --> 02:35:24,580
Thank you for watching!

1668
02:35:55,055 --> 02:35:56,277
Thank you for watching!

1669
02:37:35,347 --> 02:37:35,969
Thanks for watching!

1670
02:39:48,809 --> 02:39:49,769
[SPEAKER_11]: Gaming Radio.

1671
02:39:49,989 --> 02:39:57,252
[SPEAKER_30]: So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

1672
02:39:57,452 --> 02:39:58,792
[SPEAKER_30]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1673
02:39:59,672 --> 02:40:01,893
[SPEAKER_11]: He should be a foreign correspondent for us.

1674
02:40:02,153 --> 02:40:03,534
[SPEAKER_11]: That'd be awesome.

1675
02:40:03,874 --> 02:40:04,854
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel naked tonight.

1676
02:40:06,269 --> 02:40:07,570
[SPEAKER_11]: I have all my clothes on, don't worry.

1677
02:40:07,590 --> 02:40:08,910
[SPEAKER_11]: We didn't turn off the webcam because of that.

1678
02:40:08,930 --> 02:40:10,571
[SPEAKER_11]: We turned off the webcam because the webcam was crappy.

1679
02:40:11,011 --> 02:40:12,892
[SPEAKER_11]: Because the room is really dark.

1680
02:40:12,912 --> 02:40:15,714
[SPEAKER_11]: The room is too dark and the webcam is not that good.

1681
02:40:15,774 --> 02:40:17,774
[SPEAKER_11]: So when we get a better webcam, we will bring that back.

1682
02:40:17,794 --> 02:40:18,315
[SPEAKER_11]: We promise.

1683
02:40:18,675 --> 02:40:22,697
[SPEAKER_11]: We might even get one of those freaky remote controlled ones where you could control it during the show.

1684
02:40:24,318 --> 02:40:25,399
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll hide over here.

1685
02:40:40,373 --> 02:40:44,496
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so what we're going to do now is we're going to get into the... Oh, the reason why I feel naked.

1686
02:40:44,536 --> 02:40:44,816
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello.

1687
02:40:45,076 --> 02:40:47,798
[SPEAKER_11]: The reason why I feel naked is because I don't have headphones this week.

1688
02:40:48,798 --> 02:40:51,560
[SPEAKER_11]: I broke them last week, and I have yet to go get new ones.

1689
02:40:51,600 --> 02:40:52,241
[SPEAKER_11]: I keep forgetting.

1690
02:40:52,401 --> 02:40:58,104
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I remembered at Target today that I needed new razors and all that other stuff, but I forgot to get headphones because I'm a dumbass.

1691
02:40:58,725 --> 02:41:00,006
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel naked.

1692
02:41:00,086 --> 02:41:03,728
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't hear myself in my ears, and therefore my ego is saddened.

1693
02:41:03,928 --> 02:41:05,409
[SPEAKER_07]: And I forgot to mention earlier that

1694
02:41:05,836 --> 02:41:07,657
[SPEAKER_07]: TheCoachCarter came to my work.

1695
02:41:30,046 --> 02:41:30,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Grr, argh

1696
02:41:53,917 --> 02:41:56,459
[SPEAKER_22]: The motherfucker who keyed my car.

1697
02:41:57,200 --> 02:41:59,982
[SPEAKER_22]: I hope you have a plague of gnats inside your testicles.

1698
02:42:03,786 --> 02:42:07,029
[SPEAKER_22]: Also, you know, I'm really not too angsty because I love my car.

1699
02:42:07,745 --> 02:42:09,507
[SPEAKER_22]: My car fills me full of joy.

1700
02:42:10,148 --> 02:42:16,836
[SPEAKER_22]: But, you know, for you people who think, oh, I'm gonna pass the Lancer, fuck you, okay?

1701
02:42:17,036 --> 02:42:17,516
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck you.

1702
02:42:18,297 --> 02:42:20,520
[SPEAKER_22]: My car kicks your ass.

1703
02:42:20,980 --> 02:42:23,904
[SPEAKER_22]: Except for that special edition Corvette that passed me yesterday.

1704
02:42:26,074 --> 02:42:39,723
[SPEAKER_22]: and FU to Krispy Kreme because yesterday I had my cheat day and I ate three donuts and they were damn good but I got sick because sugar makes my stomach hurt a lot.

1705
02:42:41,244 --> 02:42:42,245
[SPEAKER_22]: www.darkskura.com

1706
02:43:07,495 --> 02:43:08,235
[SPEAKER_22]: F you to moving.

1707
02:43:08,655 --> 02:43:11,656
[SPEAKER_22]: Where I'm glad to be getting out of my crap hole apartment complex.

1708
02:43:13,397 --> 02:43:16,498
[SPEAKER_22]: It's the whole packing all of my stuff up that sucks.

1709
02:43:16,998 --> 02:43:18,539
[SPEAKER_22]: It makes me a little depressed too.

1710
02:43:19,199 --> 02:43:24,141
[SPEAKER_22]: But overall, I think the biggest F you for moving is the dust.

1711
02:43:25,261 --> 02:43:27,562
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm gonna lay down the law on the new house.

1712
02:43:28,322 --> 02:43:30,583
[SPEAKER_22]: Their house will be regularly dusted.

1713
02:43:31,363 --> 02:43:31,803
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's all.

1714
02:43:33,864 --> 02:43:35,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on to Loki.

1715
02:43:37,560 --> 02:43:38,361
[SPEAKER_09]: If I can here.

1716
02:43:42,323 --> 02:43:45,025
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I hate Britney Spears.

1717
02:43:45,845 --> 02:43:48,927
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, she just needs to fall off the face of the earth permanently.

1718
02:43:49,888 --> 02:43:53,070
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, I don't know what it is about her, but she fucking sucks.

1719
02:43:53,854 --> 02:44:13,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Hater, and fucking you the goddamn Final Fantasy XI, going down, you know, how am I supposed to ignore my family and friends and play an online game if you keep, you know, DNS crashing on me, so, oh well, I guess short doses for Final Fantasy, and then, um,

1720
02:44:15,287 --> 02:44:27,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Finally, fuck you to Round Table for your smokehouse combo pizza because it was actually pretty tasty, but it has barbecue sauce on it, so that just doesn't fit.

1721
02:44:27,056 --> 02:44:28,457
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1722
02:44:28,898 --> 02:44:34,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and fuck you to my apartment because the stove, for some reason, smokes uncontrollably, and I don't know why.

1723
02:44:34,722 --> 02:44:35,543
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to figure that out.

1724
02:44:36,123 --> 02:44:37,524
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's without anything in it.

1725
02:44:40,727 --> 02:44:43,549
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty much all that I have to deal with right now.

1726
02:44:46,624 --> 02:44:47,125
[SPEAKER_09]: and I'm done.

1727
02:44:47,445 --> 02:44:48,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, then my turn.

1728
02:44:53,453 --> 02:44:57,058
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to give an FU to this show that they have on MTV.

1729
02:44:57,158 --> 02:45:00,463
[SPEAKER_11]: First of all, I want to give an FU to the fact that I was even watching MTV at all, but I was really bored.

1730
02:45:00,783 --> 02:45:03,387
[SPEAKER_11]: But I want to give an FU to this show on MTV called Next.

1731
02:45:04,090 --> 02:45:06,451
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it's the biggest piece of trash I've ever seen in my life.

1732
02:45:07,271 --> 02:45:08,992
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so obviously scripted.

1733
02:45:09,012 --> 02:45:12,194
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, this is why people hate reality TV is because of a show like this.

1734
02:45:12,514 --> 02:45:17,596
[SPEAKER_11]: And what I really hate is I really hate its portrayal of gay guys because it makes them look all like whores.

1735
02:45:17,996 --> 02:45:25,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Because when they're like ready to speed date or whatever, the guys who are waiting to speed date are all too busy on the bus making out with each other.

1736
02:45:25,260 --> 02:45:26,980
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm like, you're all a bunch of whores.

1737
02:45:27,300 --> 02:45:27,961
[SPEAKER_11]: But to be...

1738
02:45:28,901 --> 02:45:33,047
[SPEAKER_11]: On TV, dating strangers that you know nothing about is kind of whorish anyway.

1739
02:45:33,367 --> 02:45:39,295
[SPEAKER_11]: At least they're giving away money so I can kind of sympathize with them a little bit because I do crazy shit for money as well.

1740
02:45:39,775 --> 02:45:43,179
[SPEAKER_11]: But F you to MTV for having crappy shows like Next.

1741
02:45:43,700 --> 02:45:45,102
[SPEAKER_11]: So, that's it.

1742
02:45:45,785 --> 02:45:47,286
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's my only FU of the week this week.

1743
02:45:47,346 --> 02:45:49,227
[SPEAKER_11]: I've actually had a pretty decent week, I can't complain.

1744
02:45:50,007 --> 02:45:52,809
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, Mikotov, what do you have for us tonight?

1745
02:45:55,370 --> 02:45:56,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yay, Lion Suki.

1746
02:45:58,031 --> 02:46:00,392
[SPEAKER_06]: I have an FU to NDAs, because oh my god.

1747
02:46:01,333 --> 02:46:02,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, guys.

1748
02:46:02,974 --> 02:46:03,774
[SPEAKER_06]: NDAs suck.

1749
02:46:05,295 --> 02:46:08,797
[SPEAKER_11]: FU to... That sounded like a good oh my god, though.

1750
02:46:08,837 --> 02:46:11,238
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, oh my god, I want to tell you something, but I can't.

1751
02:46:12,384 --> 02:46:14,345
[SPEAKER_11]: NDA.

1752
02:46:15,305 --> 02:46:18,306
[SPEAKER_06]: FU to the crappy EB employee today.

1753
02:46:18,626 --> 02:46:26,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I have love for EB since that's where I came from, but EB guy today was just complete jerk and rude.

1754
02:46:26,889 --> 02:46:32,351
[SPEAKER_06]: And the GameStop guy was just a little better, so FU to EB.

1755
02:46:33,132 --> 02:46:39,654
[SPEAKER_06]: FU to Mario64, it's a crappy game but I can't stop playing it on my DS because it was free.

1756
02:46:41,461 --> 02:46:47,267
[SPEAKER_06]: and FU to having to work tomorrow and FU to being drunk last night because that was painful.

1757
02:46:47,307 --> 02:46:49,489
[SPEAKER_06]: That was funny.

1758
02:46:49,569 --> 02:47:00,459
[SPEAKER_06]: It was cool when I wasn't in pain because that drinking game we played, King's Cup, was funnier than anything until I had to drink a lot during it.

1759
02:47:01,581 --> 02:47:04,243
[SPEAKER_06]: But, yeah.

1760
02:47:04,263 --> 02:47:04,343
[SPEAKER_20]: Who?

1761
02:47:08,013 --> 02:47:10,675
[SPEAKER_22]: That was just a random thing.

1762
02:47:10,916 --> 02:47:13,438
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll tell you later.

1763
02:47:13,578 --> 02:47:17,702
[SPEAKER_22]: At E3, the guy with the really long hair who was up there playing DDR.

1764
02:47:17,782 --> 02:47:18,843
[SPEAKER_22]: This was one of his cosplays.

1765
02:47:18,883 --> 02:47:19,763
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll put it in the chatroom.

1766
02:47:19,783 --> 02:47:21,565
[SPEAKER_22]: He's at Sunnyvale Gauntlet all the time.

1767
02:47:21,765 --> 02:47:23,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1768
02:47:23,306 --> 02:47:24,447
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen him as Kai.

1769
02:47:25,128 --> 02:47:25,849
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to him.

1770
02:47:26,509 --> 02:47:28,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Ruining Kai from Guilty Gear.

1771
02:47:29,211 --> 02:47:29,712
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's it.

1772
02:47:30,553 --> 02:47:32,434
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's get to the chatroom, shall we?

1773
02:47:32,454 --> 02:47:34,336
[SPEAKER_11]: Because our chatroom is especially angsty tonight.

1774
02:47:34,356 --> 02:47:35,477
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

1775
02:47:37,469 --> 02:47:42,290
[SPEAKER_11]: OMGitsDoobz, although he's under the guise of OMGtitsboobz, but whatever.

1776
02:47:42,951 --> 02:47:46,692
[SPEAKER_11]: FU to SSJ100, Matt, and MPQ for being such whores about my new name.

1777
02:47:46,772 --> 02:47:47,212
[SPEAKER_11]: Suck it up.

1778
02:47:47,292 --> 02:47:48,612
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I was just a whore about your name, too.

1779
02:47:48,632 --> 02:47:48,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

1780
02:47:48,972 --> 02:47:50,473
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, I came up with that name.

1781
02:47:50,613 --> 02:47:51,013
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

1782
02:47:51,173 --> 02:47:52,934
[SPEAKER_11]: FU to Orlando for being so damn shitty.

1783
02:47:52,974 --> 02:47:54,634
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just a waste of 14 hours of my life.

1784
02:47:54,794 --> 02:47:56,255
[SPEAKER_11]: FU to Wangang... I'm sorry.

1785
02:47:56,715 --> 02:47:59,396
[SPEAKER_11]: Wang... Wagang... I can't pronounce this word for the life of me.

1786
02:47:59,516 --> 02:48:02,437
[SPEAKER_11]: Wagang... Wagang... Wagang... Wang... Wangan?

1787
02:48:02,757 --> 02:48:03,977
[SPEAKER_11]: I think maybe... Wangan?

1788
02:48:04,417 --> 02:48:05,417
[SPEAKER_11]: He missed a letter, then.

1789
02:48:05,738 --> 02:48:06,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Wangan Midnight 2.

1790
02:48:07,938 --> 02:48:08,719
[SPEAKER_11]: Wangan, whatever.

1791
02:48:09,119 --> 02:48:10,300
[SPEAKER_11]: That game, the race game.

1792
02:48:10,680 --> 02:48:18,047
[SPEAKER_11]: Because of it, I don't like Initial D Arcade anymore and F you to Malaysian people and MMOs because their English is just as annoying as the English of Brazilian people.

1793
02:48:18,827 --> 02:48:20,349
[SPEAKER_11]: That was good and racist.

1794
02:48:20,429 --> 02:48:23,712
[SPEAKER_11]: He also says, oh, and F you to O2 Jam for having such bad songs.

1795
02:48:23,772 --> 02:48:24,112
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate it.

1796
02:48:25,985 --> 02:48:29,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Moving on, Yuki would like to say, F you to work being so dead today.

1797
02:48:29,468 --> 02:48:32,831
[SPEAKER_11]: Much as the money would help with my credit card payment, I just wanted to be sent home early.

1798
02:48:33,152 --> 02:48:33,692
[SPEAKER_11]: I know the feeling.

1799
02:48:34,433 --> 02:48:37,135
[SPEAKER_11]: StarTetsuya says, F you to AOL and my phone line.

1800
02:48:37,175 --> 02:48:38,657
[SPEAKER_11]: I missed half the show because of it.

1801
02:48:39,538 --> 02:48:40,559
[SPEAKER_11]: America Offline.

1802
02:48:41,459 --> 02:48:45,383
[SPEAKER_11]: DJ Dark Knight says, let me just flat out say it, F you to gas prices.

1803
02:48:45,523 --> 02:48:46,244
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and an F you to work.

1804
02:48:47,401 --> 02:48:53,367
[SPEAKER_11]: SSJ100 Matt says, F you to real life work for keeping me away from this show and games in general.

1805
02:48:53,587 --> 02:48:54,328
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to emo.

1806
02:48:54,888 --> 02:48:56,470
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to the New York Yankees losing.

1807
02:48:56,550 --> 02:48:58,051
[SPEAKER_11]: Laugh now, but they will be back.

1808
02:48:59,693 --> 02:49:04,117
[SPEAKER_11]: MPQ says, F you to myself for forgetting about the show last week.

1809
02:49:05,198 --> 02:49:07,120
[SPEAKER_11]: LemonLimeJump says, F you to my town.

1810
02:49:07,400 --> 02:49:07,781
[SPEAKER_11]: Period.

1811
02:49:09,130 --> 02:49:13,773
[SPEAKER_11]: Reznor says, nice fuck you to people that think Honda Civics with bling can outrace anything.

1812
02:49:14,153 --> 02:49:18,496
[SPEAKER_11]: And another F you to anyone that thinks any NES game sucks because of the graphics.

1813
02:49:21,298 --> 02:49:22,619
[SPEAKER_11]: What about Bubble Bath Babes?

1814
02:49:22,739 --> 02:49:24,300
[SPEAKER_11]: The graphics were kind of shitty in that game.

1815
02:49:24,921 --> 02:49:27,582
[SPEAKER_11]: And the game could have been a whole lot better if the graphics were better.

1816
02:49:27,883 --> 02:49:30,985
[SPEAKER_28]: That game was too damn hard for boobies, okay, honestly.

1817
02:49:32,537 --> 02:49:32,797
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1818
02:49:33,177 --> 02:49:36,038
[SPEAKER_11]: Illusion says major, major, major F you to In The Groove shipping.

1819
02:49:36,098 --> 02:49:39,138
[SPEAKER_11]: Not an F you to In The Groove, but an F you to the fact that I didn't get my copy.

1820
02:49:39,558 --> 02:49:43,319
[SPEAKER_11]: My friend doesn't order things online, so she gave me her money to order the game for her.

1821
02:49:43,659 --> 02:49:46,180
[SPEAKER_11]: So both copies of the game were supposed to ship to my house.

1822
02:49:46,520 --> 02:49:50,101
[SPEAKER_11]: But only her copy shipped to my house on Friday, driving me mad with anger.

1823
02:49:50,801 --> 02:49:52,221
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to only three people going to carry it.

1824
02:49:52,241 --> 02:49:54,581
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you get to keep your copy, and she has to wait for hers.

1825
02:49:54,621 --> 02:49:55,842
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the way it works, buddy.

1826
02:49:55,862 --> 02:49:57,562
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1827
02:49:58,607 --> 02:50:00,268
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting question in the chatroom there.

1828
02:50:00,328 --> 02:50:04,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Vid Palace says, Did you know that AOL has a video game radio station?

1829
02:50:05,412 --> 02:50:07,353
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you know that ours is better?

1830
02:50:08,073 --> 02:50:09,735
[SPEAKER_22]: Did you know that we don't give a flying flip?

1831
02:50:11,075 --> 02:50:12,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you ever know that you're my hero?

1832
02:50:15,118 --> 02:50:16,459
[SPEAKER_07]: You're everything I wish I could be.

1833
02:50:17,260 --> 02:50:18,561
[SPEAKER_22]: Can you fly higher than an eagle?

1834
02:50:20,302 --> 02:50:21,503
[SPEAKER_07]: I am the wind beneath your... Stop it!

1835
02:50:21,643 --> 02:50:22,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop it right now!

1836
02:50:24,224 --> 02:50:24,685
[SPEAKER_11]: God...

1837
02:50:28,141 --> 02:50:28,501
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1838
02:50:30,062 --> 02:50:32,463
[SPEAKER_11]: I almost want to play something from old school NES, but I'll wait.

1839
02:50:32,583 --> 02:50:35,345
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll wait for another appropriate occasion to do that.

1840
02:50:37,466 --> 02:50:38,066
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

1841
02:50:39,147 --> 02:50:39,867
[SPEAKER_11]: What can we do now?

1842
02:50:40,127 --> 02:50:41,188
[SPEAKER_11]: We could do some Ask Orange Lounge.

1843
02:50:41,228 --> 02:50:42,889
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have any questions in yet.

1844
02:50:45,190 --> 02:50:46,410
[SPEAKER_11]: We're starting to run out of show here.

1845
02:50:46,430 --> 02:50:47,411
[SPEAKER_11]: We're running out of steam.

1846
02:50:48,131 --> 02:50:49,452
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't have no post of the week.

1847
02:50:49,572 --> 02:50:50,973
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have another news story?

1848
02:50:50,993 --> 02:50:51,753
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have something, Loki?

1849
02:50:51,773 --> 02:50:53,654
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess we're just going to have to talk about other news.

1850
02:50:54,588 --> 02:50:55,313
[SPEAKER_22]: I know, it sucks.

1851
02:50:55,957 --> 02:50:57,930
[SPEAKER_22]: I have dead skin on my feet.

1852
02:50:59,568 --> 02:51:02,629
[SPEAKER_07]: That's breaking news, folks.

1853
02:51:02,709 --> 02:51:06,530
[SPEAKER_07]: PSP, Homebrew on version 1.5 PSP.

1854
02:51:06,570 --> 02:51:07,650
[SPEAKER_07]: That means all you U.S.

1855
02:51:07,670 --> 02:51:13,712
[SPEAKER_07]: people that have been waiting for Homebrew games and all the Japanese people have been rubbing it in your face, it's coming.

1856
02:51:14,292 --> 02:51:20,413
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be released supposedly on June 15th at 3 p.m.

1857
02:51:21,333 --> 02:51:22,054
[SPEAKER_07]: General Mountain Time.

1858
02:51:22,634 --> 02:51:26,835
[SPEAKER_07]: And what's cool about it is what they're saying right now is it's only running on version 1.5, so...

1859
02:51:27,975 --> 02:51:29,776
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you mean Greenwich time?

1860
02:51:30,657 --> 02:51:31,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

1861
02:51:32,037 --> 02:51:32,458
[SPEAKER_11]: Never mind.

1862
02:51:32,898 --> 02:51:33,798
[SPEAKER_11]: Just poking fun.

1863
02:51:34,619 --> 02:51:35,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Kiss my ass.

1864
02:51:35,119 --> 02:51:35,499
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care.

1865
02:51:36,120 --> 02:51:41,783
[SPEAKER_07]: All I know is it's coming out in a couple days and that makes me happy because I'll be able to run crappy stuff for the PSP.

1866
02:51:42,003 --> 02:51:46,106
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be able to put all my Game Boy Advance games on the PSP.

1867
02:51:46,526 --> 02:51:48,807
[SPEAKER_07]: How's that for irony?

1868
02:51:49,187 --> 02:51:50,988
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, yeah, it's going to be coming out.

1869
02:51:51,008 --> 02:51:51,769
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be cool.

1870
02:51:52,270 --> 02:51:56,179
[SPEAKER_07]: And they've got MAME working for it right now, so you know what that means I'm going to try to do?

1871
02:51:56,961 --> 02:51:58,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, that's right.

1872
02:51:59,427 --> 02:52:01,933
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be putting on the porno games.

1873
02:52:05,241 --> 02:52:07,162
[SPEAKER_11]: All the gals panic I can possibly handle.

1874
02:52:07,462 --> 02:52:09,623
[SPEAKER_11]: More to look forward on that on the podcast.

1875
02:52:09,663 --> 02:52:10,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, check out the podcast.

1876
02:52:10,603 --> 02:52:11,424
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, check it out.

1877
02:52:12,444 --> 02:52:13,444
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to do this story.

1878
02:52:13,484 --> 02:52:15,505
[SPEAKER_11]: It's something you actually posted at the site earlier this week.

1879
02:52:15,545 --> 02:52:16,606
[SPEAKER_11]: This is too damn good.

1880
02:52:16,646 --> 02:52:20,967
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't believe we haven't brought this up on the show earlier because we probably could have gone off for about a half hour on it.

1881
02:52:21,587 --> 02:52:22,968
[SPEAKER_11]: You posted something on Tuesday.

1882
02:52:23,028 --> 02:52:27,350
[SPEAKER_11]: It has to do with Dance Dance Revolution being mixed with fire.

1883
02:52:27,790 --> 02:52:28,090
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1884
02:52:29,030 --> 02:52:30,291
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, Jamie, don't get too excited.

1885
02:52:33,478 --> 02:52:41,987
[SPEAKER_11]: Dance Dance Immolation is the name of the game here and you can actually go to this website here and the way this works, what is Dance Dance Immolation?

1886
02:52:42,548 --> 02:52:50,997
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an adaptation, this is from the website interpretivearsen.com slash ddi actually is the name of the site here.

1887
02:52:51,677 --> 02:52:57,263
[SPEAKER_11]: Dance Dance Immolation is an adaptation of the popular arcade video game Dance Dance Revolution, but with fire.

1888
02:52:57,843 --> 02:52:59,385
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, you play DDR.

1889
02:52:59,705 --> 02:53:03,408
[SPEAKER_11]: When you do well, the computer shoots big propane blasts up in the air.

1890
02:53:03,889 --> 02:53:06,872
[SPEAKER_11]: When you do poorly, it shoots you in the face with flamethrowers.

1891
02:53:07,312 --> 02:53:09,394
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, you as in your actual body.

1892
02:53:09,754 --> 02:53:12,237
[SPEAKER_11]: And yes, flamethrowers, like the kind that are on fire.

1893
02:53:13,564 --> 02:53:16,768
[SPEAKER_11]: Now before you freak out here, this is what they say, wait, isn't this dangerous?

1894
02:53:17,149 --> 02:53:26,702
[SPEAKER_11]: Before you play, you'll put on a fully aluminized proximity suit with a forced air respirator, gloves, fireproof hood, the whole bit.

1895
02:53:27,022 --> 02:53:29,926
[SPEAKER_11]: These are the suits that are used for fighting fires at airports.

1896
02:53:31,075 --> 02:53:35,839
[SPEAKER_11]: So basically, you suit up and you play DDR, but if you screw up, you get shot with fire.

1897
02:53:36,079 --> 02:53:38,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Some more info on this.

1898
02:53:38,161 --> 02:53:43,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, now the website right now, they just have their testing, their homemade flamethrower that they made.

1899
02:53:44,366 --> 02:53:46,928
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not actually gameplay shots or anything like that.

1900
02:53:47,389 --> 02:53:51,431
[SPEAKER_07]: However, there was another post on the DDR community in Live Journal.

1901
02:53:51,451 --> 02:53:53,152
[SPEAKER_07]: They had some more pictures of the same thing.

1902
02:53:53,572 --> 02:54:08,379
[SPEAKER_07]: But what's going to be happening is they actually have a computer running Step Mania with Firebase theme and Firebase songs, like Burning Heat, Burning Up For You, My Fire, stuff like that.

1903
02:54:08,559 --> 02:54:09,679
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's going to be running Step Mania.

1904
02:54:09,920 --> 02:54:12,541
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to play this, you've got to go on the Burning Man.

1905
02:54:13,550 --> 02:54:14,471
[SPEAKER_11]: How appropriate.

1906
02:54:14,591 --> 02:54:17,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Burning Man, and there's also some fire festival, I guess, in Oakland or something.

1907
02:54:17,834 --> 02:54:20,116
[SPEAKER_11]: I never got Burning Man.

1908
02:54:20,176 --> 02:54:23,899
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I understand it's a big thing that all these people go to the desert for.

1909
02:54:23,919 --> 02:54:26,541
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't get it, so to speak.

1910
02:54:27,942 --> 02:54:33,007
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if this is representative of what goes on at Burning Man, but let's just say you aren't selling any tickets with this, okay?

1911
02:54:33,467 --> 02:54:39,472
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, this is the kind of stuff I would expect to see, like, on Jackass, but, like, I don't know, even crazier.

1912
02:54:39,553 --> 02:54:40,714
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just waiting for the lawsuits.

1913
02:54:41,836 --> 02:54:43,177
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think there'll be a lawsuit.

1914
02:54:43,217 --> 02:54:46,318
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, these people probably do this with other crap all the time.

1915
02:54:47,059 --> 02:54:52,141
[SPEAKER_11]: If people are stupid enough to suit up, I'm sure that they have disclaimers out the ass.

1916
02:54:52,161 --> 02:54:53,262
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not talking about them suiting up.

1917
02:54:53,302 --> 02:54:56,203
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm talking about stupid kids lighting themselves on fire.

1918
02:54:58,304 --> 02:55:00,045
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they see this on TV or something?

1919
02:55:00,305 --> 02:55:01,726
[SPEAKER_11]: Or they see this in action?

1920
02:55:01,906 --> 02:55:02,886
[SPEAKER_11]: They see this on the internet?

1921
02:55:03,006 --> 02:55:03,667
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess, yeah.

1922
02:55:03,687 --> 02:55:05,988
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, maybe parents ought to, you know, take responsibility.

1923
02:55:06,048 --> 02:55:07,289
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep fire away from their kids.

1924
02:55:08,169 --> 02:55:09,670
[SPEAKER_24]: Parents just don't understand.

1925
02:55:11,192 --> 02:55:12,493
[SPEAKER_11]: You know.

1926
02:55:14,075 --> 02:55:15,757
[SPEAKER_11]: So, very interesting.

1927
02:55:15,797 --> 02:55:18,560
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're interested in fire and DDR, maybe this is the thing for you.

1928
02:55:20,122 --> 02:55:21,423
[SPEAKER_11]: Dance, dance, what was this again?

1929
02:55:21,503 --> 02:55:21,964
[SPEAKER_11]: Immolation.

1930
02:55:26,147 --> 02:55:31,789
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course they have a PayPal link on their site because, you know, you couldn't have this without a PayPal link.

1931
02:55:31,809 --> 02:55:37,531
[SPEAKER_11]: And the festival that they'll be showing us at, the Crucible's Fire Arts Festival in Oakland in July.

1932
02:55:37,871 --> 02:55:40,072
[SPEAKER_11]: Who knew that there was a whole festival about fire?

1933
02:55:40,572 --> 02:55:41,953
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie, you should be going to this.

1934
02:55:42,433 --> 02:55:46,315
[SPEAKER_22]: I would so... You know, I'm actually on the website right now.

1935
02:55:48,515 --> 02:55:51,437
[SPEAKER_11]: I would be afraid that, like, in order to go, they would, like, shoot you with fire.

1936
02:55:51,477 --> 02:55:52,437
[SPEAKER_22]: I know people who've gone.

1937
02:55:53,067 --> 02:55:54,211
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh god, that scares me.

1938
02:55:54,953 --> 02:55:57,401
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, fire's cool and all, but not when it's on me.

1939
02:56:00,390 --> 02:56:07,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I want to do, like, Dance Dance, Hydro... Hydronization or something like that, where they shoot water.

1940
02:56:07,076 --> 02:56:08,057
[SPEAKER_11]: How about a Super Soaker?

1941
02:56:08,117 --> 02:56:12,280
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a little less harmful, but of course a Super Soaker gets on the pad and then it, you know, ruins the whole thing.

1942
02:56:13,021 --> 02:56:13,641
[SPEAKER_11]: Softpad.

1943
02:56:13,722 --> 02:56:14,602
[SPEAKER_11]: Slip and slide.

1944
02:56:14,702 --> 02:56:15,923
[SPEAKER_11]: Softpad, there you go.

1945
02:56:16,504 --> 02:56:17,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Slip and slide DDR.

1946
02:56:17,705 --> 02:56:18,946
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, that's so cool.

1947
02:56:18,986 --> 02:56:21,388
[SPEAKER_11]: You're tripping and falling on the bar and breaking bones.

1948
02:56:21,889 --> 02:56:22,829
[SPEAKER_11]: Hilarious!

1949
02:56:26,773 --> 02:56:27,033
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1950
02:56:27,987 --> 02:56:30,008
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's going to do it for tonight's show, boys and girls.

1963
02:56:58,634 --> 02:57:26,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, your final thought my final thought is I hope what they're saying about the PSP is true and then I'll be able to run homebrew games on Wednesday because I've got there's not that many games I want to buy and the emulators rock so go homebrew hoping for Stepmania ported to the PSP because I don't know because IndieGroove needs a PSP version or not

1964
02:57:27,307 --> 02:57:28,508

1965
02:57:30,509 --> 02:57:34,011
[SPEAKER_06]: I like blue alcohol, blue DSs, and Russian boys.

1966
02:57:37,514 --> 02:57:43,598
[SPEAKER_11]: My final thought is... I don't have one.

1967
02:57:43,698 --> 02:57:44,078
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1968
02:57:44,138 --> 02:57:44,518
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have any.

1969
02:57:44,558 --> 02:57:45,019
[SPEAKER_22]: Chirp, chirp.

1970
02:57:45,139 --> 02:57:45,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Chirp, chirp.

1971
02:57:45,639 --> 02:57:46,300
[SPEAKER_09]: It's blank.

1972
02:57:47,640 --> 02:57:53,064

2007
03:01:43,382 --> 03:01:47,125
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright guys, I promised that after the show we would play this one more time.

2008
03:01:47,145 --> 03:01:49,547
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm actually going to play the original version of this though.

2009
03:01:49,927 --> 03:01:55,812
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very similar to the DDR one, but it's just a little shorter, a little less instruments, but same idea.

2010
03:01:55,852 --> 03:01:58,174
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you guys didn't get to hear this earlier, you'll still get an idea.

2011
03:01:58,194 --> 03:01:59,995
[SPEAKER_11]: And those of you that did hear it, it's something a little different.

2012
03:02:00,315 --> 03:02:07,201
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is the album version of the new song we announced tonight, because actually Spray was the first to announce this on their website, the artist.

2013
03:02:07,941 --> 03:02:09,523
[SPEAKER_11]: I Am Gothic, the original version.

2014
03:02:09,583 --> 03:02:09,823
[SPEAKER_11]: Enjoy.

2015
03:02:15,087 --> 03:02:15,651
Thank you.

2016
03:05:55,771 --> 03:05:58,273
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, there was the original version of I Am Gothic.

2017
03:05:58,733 --> 03:06:02,876
[SPEAKER_11]: So, should be an interesting next few weeks as we start to learn some more.

2018
03:06:02,896 --> 03:06:07,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I should say next few months as we start to learn more and more of these songs that we will be doing the DDR to.

2019
03:06:07,579 --> 03:06:09,821
[SPEAKER_11]: Until next time, have a good one.
