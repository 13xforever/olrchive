6
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,000
Goodbye, Yellow Brick Mode

00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,300

8
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,500
Goodbye, Yellow Brick Mode

9
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,000

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,400

11
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,400

13
00:01:31,400 --> 00:02:00,400
The following live program is a special presentation of Orange Lounge Radio.

14
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:13,800
On tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio episode number 146, we're going to be debuting

15
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,280
a new song from Ultramix 3.

16
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,720
And the song that we're debuting, it's already been announced out there on the internet,

17
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,600
just none of you people found it yet.

18
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,960
So we're going to be blowing the lid on that one tonight.

19
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,960
We've already got the songs.

20
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,960
We're going to play that for you guys.

21
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,960
That's going to be tonight.

22
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:34,960

Go hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Ms. Jamie Summers, Dark Sakura.

68
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So who keyed my new car?

69
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,720
What?

70
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,840
Yeah, I don't know if there's already there, but it's very hard to tell cuz my car is silver

71
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,040
Uh-huh, so it doesn't show up as glaringly as it would on any other color

72
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:43,120
Oh, but I noticed it was like the light is reflecting in a funny way. I

73
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:48,720
got a car and my car kicks everybody's ass twice and

74
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,660
several times on Sunday and then like just

75
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,280
Fucks all that shit up

76
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,980
Well, I'm sure we'll be hearing more about that later.

77
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,340
Also joining us tonight, say hello to Tech Masoloki.

78
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,260
Hi.

79
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,580
I finished my pizza.

80
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,380
You finished your pizza and bread six nights.

81
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,700
Sorry about the little hiccup there in the beginning, boys and girls.

82
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:15,540
We accidentally had a router mishap, and something came unplugged during the intro there.

83
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,540
We cut the wrong wire.

84
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:22,020
Yes, basically we accidentally cut the wire that would blow everything up, because you

85
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,020
know how in the movies-

86
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:28,720
It's like you press the red button in an idiot mansion in the pool.

87
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,960
Or for those that didn't play through that game, which would be a lot of our audience,

88
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,200
because that game is kind of old. I'd always get just fed up and purposefully find the pool,

89
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,240
drain it because

90
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,420
the pool cooled the nuclear reactor,

91
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,160
and pressing the button made it explode. I wish they would release that TV show on DVD or

92
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,380
something, because I totally missed the TV show.

93
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:49,160
Okay, anyway, my analogy. You know how, like in the movies, they always have the green wire and the

94
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:54,740
red wire and you have to cut the right wire or everything will blow up, well we accidentally

95
00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:00,460
cut the wire that blew everything up.

96
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:04,420
Moving on, we are back, hello.

97
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,360
We got a fun show for you guys tonight.

98
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,160
We even have a very special guest here tonight, but he'll introduce himself after the first

99
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,880
break because we don't have all our listeners back yet.

100
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,880
We had a mishap.

101
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,960
Yeah, so we'll be back.

102
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,920
So let's go to a break and when we come back, we'll get to the show.

103
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,740
As I mentioned in the opening there, we are going to debut an UltraMix 3 song, a brand

104
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,080
new song here on the show.

105
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,700
Yeah, that's cool.

106
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,380
And the thing is, is that it's already been out there on the internet, just nobody found

107
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,380
it yet.

108
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,380
But we did.

109
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,580
So we're gonna unveil it to the rest of you guys.

110
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:40,220
We're gonna point at the pink elephant in the room tonight and say, look, UltraMix 3

111
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,220
song right over there.

112
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,340
There'll be also some more crap we're debuting too.

113
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,340
Like what?

114
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:51,340
Well, what's it say on the CD here? There's two songs on there, and what are they?

115
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,340
Interesting. Am I supposed to say now or later?

116
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:59,340
We'll say it later, but there's two songs on there that have remixes to them now, and

117
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:03,340
they're okay, but they'll never be released on the internet because they're B-sides.

118
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,340
Alright, so tonight's the only time you'll hear them then.

119
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,340
Well, maybe.

120
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,340
Alright, let's go into this break, and this first break we're going to hear some music

121
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:15,780
some music from DER UltraMix 2. Starting off with a song we were the first to blow the

122
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:20,100
lid off of last year, about a year ago this time, so here it is. For those of you guys

123
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,060
that are trying to get your friends in to listen, because we are going to be announcing

124
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:26,780
that new song and playing the new song, we have it, we found a copy of it out there,

125
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:32,540
so we're going to play the new song for you guys. That should be about 745, 8 o'clock-ish,

126
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:36,980
just so you know, but don't just tune out and then tune back in then, because we've

127
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,100
got loads of fun for you guys tonight cage match and stuff going on within the

128
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,700
groove as well and all the stuff you know and love here at orange lounge

129
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:51,700
Radio. We'll be back after this.

130
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,700
And yet nobody knows

131
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,700
Diddle, daddle, chicken chat

132
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,700
Shoots in the breeze

133
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,700
Put a clack in splutters

134
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,700
There's a synchronous symphony

135
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,700
Play from the familiar

136
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,700
Conjure a search a jive

137
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,700
Fidget in the mind

138
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,540
Enjoy chats with no regrets

139
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:47,340
Analyzing, hallucinations

140
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,640
Wind a lick in the imagination

141
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,480
Big hands, big hands, shadows dancing

142
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,480
Here's a synchronous symphony

143
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,780
Diddle-daddle, chin-shot

144
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,080
Shootin' the brains

145
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,080
Pat-a-clack, the cadence slatters

146
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,080
Is a synchronous symphony

147
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:59,560
Let me tell you something you don't know Let me tell you something you don't know

148
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:27,560
Let me tell you something you don't know Let me tell you something you don't know

149
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:34,560
If you keep those secrets, I won't go

150
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:43,560
If you keep those secrets, I won't go

151
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,560
I'm learning from you

152
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,560
Thank you for watching!

153
00:15:45,560 --> 00:16:01,560
I was picked up for a TV show, it's called B-24

154
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:08,560
I am the girl that you all know, to love, hate or adore

155
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,560
I've been waiting for my life

156
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,560
Trying to be seen

157
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,560
Seen by everyone

158
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,560
I wanted to be someone

159
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,560
I'm better soon before

160
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,560
Longing to be seen

161
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,560
I'm not the bad girl

162
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,560
I'll do anything

163
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,560
I'm better than the star

164
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,560
Longing to be seen

165
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:06,560
I'm the silver girl I'm the baby green

166
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:13,560
Like the blue stars Wanting everything

167
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,560
I'm just a little girl

168
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:22,560
I'll do anything you need

169
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,560
Oh

170
00:18:46,560 --> 00:19:13,560
Hi Ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

171
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,960
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

172
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:24,040
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

173
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:30,560
And we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 146.

174
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:35,360
Off to a very interesting start tonight with some stuff going on there

175
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,160
in the opening where we kind of disconnected there for a little bit.

176
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,800
And now folks in the chat room are saying they heard Skips there

177
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,600
in the last break.

178
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,920
I have no idea what that's about.

179
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:47,600
We don't show anything going on on our end, but I have no idea.

180
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,840
So hopefully everything's OK.

181
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,400
Anyway, tonight we are going to play a brand new song from Ultra Mix 3 for you

182
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:00,080
guys, probably in about, I don't know, probably about a little over an hour

183
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,640
from now.

184
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,640
In the meantime, it's myself, Dark Sakura, and Loki here tonight.

185
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,600
However, we do want to introduce a very special guest we have here tonight,

186
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,040
one of our favorite folks to have here in the studio who hasn't been here

187
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,040
In a while, might I add, I want you to introduce ourselves for the listeners.

188
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:22,040
Hi, it's Miklotov, Seagurd, whatever you want to call me.

189
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,040
What's up?

190
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,040
Hey, how you doing?

191
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,040
I'm good, good, good, yeah.

192
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,040
So, back at the ol' Konami now?

193
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,040
Yeah.

194
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,040
How's it going?

195
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,040
Pretty good.

196
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,040
Yeah, that's all I can say about that.

197
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,040
Yeah, I know, you can't really say anything, can you?

198
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,040
No, no I can't.

199
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,040
Ah, that's a bummer.

200
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,600
to at least see the new stuff that we're all excited about?

201
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,040
I don't know, it's a little thing called NDA.

202
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,400
Ah, you can't even say that.

203
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,720
Alright, well, that's too bad.

204
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,000
Which means that's a...

205
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
What?

206
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
That means yes, he has.

207
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
That's exactly what that means.

208
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Is that no means yes?

209
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,320
Because it would have been a no, otherwise, not, I can't talk about that.

210
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:08,160
Hey, let's use some reverse psychology to figure out some more stuff here.

211
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:16,120
Every time I answer NDA, that means yes.

212
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,560
Was somebody smoking crack when they put Butterfly on UltraMix 3?

213
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,560
NDA.

214
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,240
Okay, just curious.

215
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:31,340
Alright, also I have to point out is that because we are disclosing a new song tonight,

216
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,720
this has nothing to do with the coincidence that Miggletove is here because he is under

217
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,720
an NDA.

218
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,800
I didn't know about this till yesterday that you even knew about the song.

219
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,800
Yes.

220
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,720
As you will find out when we reveal the song, you'll find out why we're revealing the song

221
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,960
and it will make sense how all the cards kind of fell into place.

222
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,880
So we'll kind of get to that when we talk about the song.

223
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,880
But it has nothing to do with the song.

224
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,880
Was it GamePro again?

225
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,840
It actually was not GamePro, funny enough, but it was an internet website that spilled

226
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,840
in.

227
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,720
I will say that much.

228
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,720
And it wasn't a DDR-related website, so it's just a website.

229
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,720
the website.

230
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,720
Yes, so we'll get to that a little later.

231
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,560
So we're going to get to that, but first we've got to start off the show with a little bit

232
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:15,920
of how was your week, how was your day, and DarkStalker, I know you're dying to tell us

233
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,920
all about the new vehicle.

234
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,920
Yeah.

235
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,920
So how was your week, how was your day?

236
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,200
The rest of the week I could give a rat's ass about.

237
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,360
We went on Friday to one of the Mitsubishi dealerships in town because I had settled

238
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:33,520
on getting a Lancer, and they gave us a good deal on a not too exciting 2004, you know,

239
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,200
It only had like 5,000 miles on it, so it was really good.

240
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,920
It had all the options, everything else.

241
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,520
Like, OK, this is nice.

242
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,040
And then we went to Fairfield.

243
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:49,240
And they had a 2002 Lancer OZ Rally Edition,

244
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,000
which is what I wanted.

245
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,480
And the thing about it is that this has,

246
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,160
is basically, when I think Lancer,

247
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,400
this is the car I think of, it has the logo and wide letters

248
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,440
across the back instead of just eensy tiny

249
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,880
the bottom of the trunk and has the you know the custom rims for the for that

250
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:13,960
model has all the bells and whistles it's automatic on top of it we did look

251
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:18,400
at an it out of that evolution and there's no way I could perfecting afford

252
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,520
that car but hey I also got a warranty on it that's basically the warranty for

253
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,840
a brand new car on a 2002 model so basically I'll have an old car with a

254
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,560
a brand new warranty on it.

255
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,000
And it's fabulous.

256
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,640
It's silver.

257
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,920
It only has a little ding on the sender,

258
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,240
and then I found the scratch on the door.

259
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,120
But it's fast.

260
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,680
It goes from 0 to 60 in less than three seconds.

261
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,200
How fast have you taken it so far?

262
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,220
Ben took it to 95.

263
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,120
He got challenged on Roosevelt Road driving my car last night.

264
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,840
To a race?

265
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,000
Yes, to a race by it.

266
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,800
He passed them civic, and he just swooped right down

267
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,760
in front of them.

268
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,460
and so the guy in the city started flashing his lights like he wanted to race

269
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,900
and then pulled up in the lane beside him

270
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:09,400
but Dan said he might have done it but I would have had his balls for breakfast

271
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,760
or at least I would have fed it to him for breakfast

272
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,000
so good boy. Tie the car around a tree the first day out, that's a great idea

273
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,760
yeah, especially since that, from that area

274
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:25,680
of Roseville Road goes to one lane. Yeah, not smart

275
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,680
My week has been car.

276
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,680
Oh yeah, and I got an iPod.

277
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,680
It was free.

278
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,680
So the free iPod site actually worked?

279
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,680
Yes.

280
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,680
Is there an engraving on the thing that says freeipods.com or whatever?

281
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,680
No, it's just an iPod.

282
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,680
Nice!

283
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,680
How many gigs?

284
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,680
Twenty.

285
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,680
Alright.

286
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,680
And an FM tuner now.

287
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,680
How much have you filled it up already?

288
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,680
About ten.

289
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:51,680
And I have a 28 gigabyte collection, so I was taking off all the stuff that I never

290
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,680
listen to but play for other people.

291
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,680
Right on.

292
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,180
none of my bimani music is in it except for all my taco stuff.

293
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,680
You know what's interesting? None of my bimani music is in my iPod either.

294
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,680
I have some of the long versions.

295
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,680
Yeah, me too. I have, like, some long versions. Like,

296
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,680
I have Conga feelin' in there, because you have to have Conga feelin', obviously.

297
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:12,680
Um, and very few others. I have a couple Loki remixes, funny enough, which are, you know,

298
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,180
somewhat bimani-related, I suppose.

299
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,680
Is Celica only goes to 101?

300
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,680
Pfft!

301
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,180
We only- he only took the car that fast just because of the road.

302
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:31,540
The guy in the dealership said he got it going at 130 and still had room.

303
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:34,180
I'm just making a promise in the chat room.

304
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,180
Interesting comment.

305
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:38,340
Speaking of our chat room, why don't you join at www.orangelandreo.com, click on chat.

306
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,180
We've got a lot of interesting folks in there.

307
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:44,820
Sepiroth1215 says, I'm thinking about doing the free Xbox 360.

308
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:50,220
What do you think about that now that you have reaped the rewards of one of these free

309
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,940
iPod.com sites?

310
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:58,180
you think of? First of all, the Xbox 360 isn't going to be out for months. That's why I think

311
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:02,660
it's weird that there's already all these banner ads for a win a free PlayStation 3 and it's like...

312
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,940
The thing is, look at what type of offers they have, because I did the Blockbuster one,

313
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,940
because you have to sign up for an offer and you have to get five more people to do it. Right.

314
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:18,100
I signed up for the Blockbuster one, you know, it had a two-week trial on it. It takes them five

315
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:24,180
days to confirm. They do not bill you until your free trial is up and you can cancel within

316
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,180
your free trial.

317
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,180
Right.

318
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,460
So I waited until it confirmed and I canceled it.

319
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,460
Right.

320
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,460
No money lost.

321
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:35,100
Right. That's what a lot of people do. So people wonder how do they make money off this.

322
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,100
Well...

323
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,140
Keep in mind as well that you're putting a lot of your shipping, your address, all that

324
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:43,260
stuff on those sites that you're doing the offers for, they will sell your information.

325
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,060
Yep. Absolutely.

326
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:50,300
I actually got, and they'll spam your email box, so you have to, you know, basically get

327
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:55,420
their physical address and send them an affidavit. Do not sell my information. Opt out of any

328
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,140
sharing, because under privacy law they have to do it.

329
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:02,420
Right. But, or just move on them, which is something you're going to be doing soon anyway,

330
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,420
right? Boarding addresses.

331
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:08,020
Oh, I guess that's true. Oh, the junk mail finds you.

332
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:11,700
Is there a way that you can, when you put out your forwarding address, say, except for

333
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,740
ipodfreestuff.com or whatever site you use.

334
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,300
No. That's too bad.

335
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:20,140
Although what I do want to do is take the junk mail one day and just put a big

336
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,540
return to sender stamp on it.

337
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,100
Does it really work?

338
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,860
I haven't tried it yet. Or, one thing,

339
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:32,620
there's free offer things, you know, sign up for this credit card.

340
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:38,900
I used to chop up their offer and put it in the envelope and mail it back to them.

341
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,340
That's great.

342
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,500
do they still think that you are going to come in

343
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,080
i used to rate the feast on mine

344
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,840
uh... it's it to use for what defeat

345
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,280
this p

346
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,220
i stopped getting those offers

347
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:55,480
yeah i used to send them fingers than they started showing up in chili bowls

348
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,920
so i had to stop doing that

349
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,320
uh...

350
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,860

00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,380
no

366
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,380
cuz i don't have a fan club

367
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,200

uh...

371
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:53,980
people still bring up the whole last year with the extreme threat how

372
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:56,220
we gave them not real clues

373
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,580
uh... but that was funny

374
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:02,420
wah wah wah which would be even funnier if you guys don't give them any clues this year

375
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:05,360
that would be hilarious

376
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,440
uh...

377
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,340
let's see we

378
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,440
okay i just said that was my week uh...

379
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,800
and then yesterday i got really drunk

380
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:16,000
and i was on the floor a lot. Were you dunked? I was so dunked

381
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,840
at one point i think i asked if i was black

382
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,620
for the record boys and girls mikkel tov is not black

383
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,620
uh...

384
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,700
yeah

385
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,720
and i was on the floor a whole lot

386
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,820
and played drinking games and it was fun

387
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,160
except for the pain

388
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,760
of my stomach with alcohol but uh...

389
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:40,000
Yeah, I haven't done much.

390
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,820
I kind of... Oh, I picked up a blue DS!

391
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,040
That's hot, because it's blue.

392
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,760
And now I have to get Nintendogs for it, because Nintendogs is fun.

393
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,000
You have to tell them the mall story, though.

394
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,520
Because I got so much exercise in the mall today because of you.

395
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,360
Oh, okay. So, EB has this promotion going on

396
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,400
where you buy a DS and get Mario free.

397
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,120
So you went to EB in the mall, which was on the other side

398
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,940
of the mall from where we parked.

399
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:09,080
get there i'm like hey i want a blue ds with free mario they didn't have mario

400
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,140
and i was kind of sad and i was like okay i'll just buy it

401
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,640
so i take an ad just

402
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,660
i wanted to look at it and i bought the ds

403
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:20,020
and i'm like maybe game stuff will match the ad and that's on the other side of

404
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,260
them all so we go to the other side of them all

405
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:25,300
i still have my blue ds from eb go in there

406
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:29,780
i ask if they will uh... match the ad and he's like yeah if you have the ad with you

407
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,240
which i did

408
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:36,200
But I had this Blue DS that I had to go take back to EB first to get the money back for.

409
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,060
So we walked to the other side of the mall again to EB, talked to the guy,

410
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:44,440
tell him that I want my free games so I'm going to go to Gamestop. He was cool about it.

411
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,400
And walked to the other side of the mall to Gamestop

412
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,840
to get my

413
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,360
Blue DS and my free Mario. And then I wanted a USB cable as well,

414
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,260
but they were all fifteen dollars

415
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:58,560
and they came with software I didn't need and I have one back in Kansas that's like

416
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,800
a five dollar one but that's back in kansas

417
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,540
and i could give anyone for free

418
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:08,400
uh... i don't free now

419
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,580
uh... that uh... that was it

420
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,540
uh... yeah i got a lot of exercise them all today that's all i know these little

421
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,940
skanks never perfecting it

422
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:20,940
seven years old they look like they were performing to become future strippers

423
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,100
is that it was

424
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,840
and it was great

425
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,580
and there is a lot of pedophiles that you could tell

426
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,540
what was great is that the mall at the mall here they have one of those local

427
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,860
news stations

428
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:34,900
uh... that does their life broadcast from the mall or whatever so right next

429
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:38,920
to that is one of the stores where like girls little girls can go and buy

430
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,180
accessories

431
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:44,340
makes not claire's with one some other store they were having a jury and stuff

432
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,180

433
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:46,940

438
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:04,700
they're like seven years old so um yeah at a store I don't know what is so I

439
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,700
guess maybe this performance was something they learned how to do at the

440
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,540
birthday party I don't know but they looked like little miniature Christina

441
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:14,460
Aguilera's and parasol and all those old guys are just standing there watching

442
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:19,420

444
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:30,860
christopher making my roommate making a comment as we were walking by though he

445
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:35,660
said something about like very loudly he said something like dirty whores and

446
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:39,420
one of the old guys like clicked his tongue at him as if he was like

447
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:43,660
tisking him that's funny

448
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:47,580
yeah so most people do when they listen to this show

449
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,580
Alright, anyway, Loki, how was your week, how was your day?

450
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:23,460
Went to Target because she wanted a full-length mirror so she could see how she looks every morning

451
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,740
So so he got her that

452
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:31,300
And then I don't know why that's funny girls are funny and then and then and then what was it?

453
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:35,980
We were wandering around looking for other stuff, and I'm like hey look. There's like one of those shower massagers

454
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,540
I'm like you want me to get you one of those two and

455
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:42,260
Or I forget what she said it wasn't like

456
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:47,900
Like, um, she's like, oh, that's, that's right, um, she's all, what, what would I use that

457
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,900
for?

458
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,900
I'm like, masturbation!

459
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:53,260
I said that really loud.

460
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,820
And so, that was quite funny.

461
00:33:54,820 --> 00:34:02,860
But um, then also, let's see, what else did I do this week, uh, uh, watched a lot of X

462
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,860
Play.

463
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,140
Um, a lot, a lot of X Play.

464
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:09,760
And now I love the little kitties that are on there, the sensor kitties.

465
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:17,080
And oh yeah, I also mentioned that I tried pirating Seven Sins, and it didn't work because

466
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:21,180
of the CD copy protection stuff, but I'm going to get the work eventually.

467
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:25,280
Right now I'm working on Grand Theft Auto San Andreas for the PC, because that'll be

468
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,280
fun.

469
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:31,580
I do have a legal copy though for my Playstation 2, I just want to play it on the PC now too.

470
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:38,960
So I say that's completely illegal, and other than that, I've been, I tried playing some

471
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:45,440
final fantasy and the servers got dns attacked again again they haven't fixed that crap again

472
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,880
thank god i quit but it's cool though because it was like right about when i was gonna go to bed

473
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:57,440
and i was trying to figure a way to get out of the party i'm like oh that'll work so um yeah that was

474
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:03,200
it all right my weekend my day well heck i mean miklotov just kind of stole most of my story

475
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,960
because i've been hanging with him most of the weekend because i had i had to drive to the bay

476
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:12,560
area to get them the other day and I guess that was fun driving by myself

477
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,680
let's see what else getting drunk last night was kind of fun I actually drank

478
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:23,320
quite a bit myself I actually got drunk I started drinking at about six o'clock

479
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:27,960
last night and what was I having oh I had that Malibu and pineapple but it was

480
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,420
about the equivalent of about ten shots of Malibu and then a little bit of

481
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:36,140
pineapple in there so I started drinking that and I think I had down that whole

482
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:39,560
thing by seven o'clock. So by that point I was pretty butt. And then I had a couple other

483
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:46,800
miscellaneous shots. I was pretty much drunk by 7.30. Well, finally I think I sobered up

484
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:53,440
and I was ready to go to the club about nine o'clock. No, stop laughing. By the time I

485
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,840
actually got to the bar, I was pretty sober. Like not like 100% sober. Like I wouldn't

486
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:03,600
try to drive a car or anything, but I was coherent, right? So I get to the club and

487
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,360
I do I start drinking again because I want to get drunk again

488
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,960
But then everybody kept leaving and nice was dancing and I didn't really end up getting drunk

489
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,880
Just kind of buzzed which is too bad because that would have been quite an accomplishment to get drunk

490
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:20,300
Sober and then drunk again all in one night, so I will just have to aspire to do that in a future week

491
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,800
I've done it. I bet you

492
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,920
Didn't you do that here on a show once yes, I did

493
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,920
Oh! Yes, I did. Yes, I did.

494
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,920
We have to do another drunk show sometime. We kind of missed the last couple three day weekends.

495
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,920
Getting me drunk's expensive.

496
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,920
It is.

497
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,920
Let's find some cheap tequila.

498
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,920
But that's nasty.

499
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,920
What day is the Fourth of July?

500
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,920
I'm probably doing...well, I don't know. I actually have had a hangover.

501
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,920
Didn't you swear after the last drunk show that you weren't doing it again?

502
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,920
Yeah.

503
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,920
Hey! Hey here!

504
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,920
Guess what?

505
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,920
What?

506
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,920
The Fourth of July falls on a Monday.

507
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,600
I work for a bank.

508
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,200
Alright, sounds like we have a date set.

509
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,000
Uh, we're having a drunk show.

510
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,600
You, me, and a bottle of tequila, I'll have a date.

511
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,600
Hey, I got a-

512
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,600
No.

513
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,880
I will do a drunk show on one condition.

514
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,600
The tequila is the good Gula Gave tequila.

515
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,600
Know what you can do?

516
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,600
How much is that gonna set us back, bottle?

517
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,600
No.

518
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,600
About twenty bucks.

519
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,600
Get the crappy shit, and then get a Brito water filter.

520
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:27,280
You pour- you filter it through a few times, golden.

521
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,780
Some of our younger listeners are kind of lost in this conversation right now, and I

522
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,780
say that's good because...

523
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,940
You're too young to be drinking and chillin's?

524
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:35,940
Yes.

525
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,500
You should not be drinking until you're of age.

526
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,500
Exactly.

527
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,500
You gotta get the order of ages right.

528
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,180
First it's illegitimate children, then it's drinking.

529
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:47,340
So go get knocked up, then have some booze.

530
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,340
No.

531
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,820
Actually, the reason why we do the drunk shows, this is the reason behind it, because we can

532
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:55,820
show you what an ass you will make of yourself when you're drunk, so it scares all you freaking

533
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:58,820
kids out there and then not drinking because if you're listening to us going

534
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:02,540
oh my gosh if I drink I'm gonna turn into that those idiots I could take

535
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:07,300
Vicodin right now don't take Vicodin and then drink that's really really bad I

536
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:11,660
don't think I can do it right now I'll have to have to do an all-nighter if

537
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:14,980
it's gonna be a drinking show because I can't drive home afterwards we should do

538
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:23,780
an all-nighter show oh my god that would great just like just like rent out

539
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:28,800
things to talk about let's get me I'm so drunk let's get me to talk here get him

540
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:34,200
drunk too and then he'll probably be able to get around that NDA so black

541
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,560
miklotov what do you have for us now

542
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,360
maybe we could get him to bring some of his co-workers up here we'll get them

543
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:48,720
all drunk one of them's liable to spill the beans get Jason Enos up here there

544
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,720
There you go.

545
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,720
Oh, that guy was awesome.

546
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,720
That's what we need to do.

547
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,720
Tell Jason he needs to come up.

548
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,720
We'll get him drunk.

549
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,960
He should come on the show.

550
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,520
We'll find him some liquor if you come hang out with us.

551
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,520
Fun times.

552
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,760
All right.

553
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,960
Enough talk about things that will be happening in the future.

554
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,880
Let's talk about things that are happening in the now, such as an upcoming break and

555
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,720
an UltraMix 3 song coming your way in about 45 minutes.

556
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,720
Eventually.

557
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,720
Yes.

558
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:22,440
And here's, like, a little bit of a hint as to tonight's song.

559
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:28,440
When we discovered what the song was, I could do nothing but laugh because it

560
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:33,800
really fits in with something we've...with a theme we've been having going on on

561
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:40,040
the show for the past couple weeks. Like, it's so funny. I can't even...yeah,

562
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:44,200
I can't...this is going to be so funny. I can't wait. I can't wait.

563
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,980
it's just it's like the biggest coincidence ever

564
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,960
uh... it's amazing

565
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,080

566
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:56,960

567
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,960

00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,480

Little little mermaid

573
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,960
Nobody wants to know

574
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,960
Ain't no beautiful world

You've got a easy way

588
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,360

00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,360
Anano! Anano!

595
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:41,360
Don't you know, don't you know, I've been waiting for you

596
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:45,360
Don't you know, baby, you could show up right on time

597
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:48,360
Can't you see, I've been waiting for you

598
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,360
Can't you see, baby, you just wanna rise

599
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:54,360
All the time

600
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,360
So now it's thunder

601
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,360
I wasn't free

602
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,360
All I wanted was attention

603
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,360
Party after party

604
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,360
Beauty and money

605
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,360
We were so desperate for perfection

606
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:16,860
But you have made me feel so good

607
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:20,360
If I could be closer to you

608
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,360
I'd close my eyes

609
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,860
In your arms, I'd be gentle again

610
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:27,360
With you

611
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,860
Don't you know, don't you know

612
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,860
I've been waiting for you

613
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:31,860
Don't you know baby

614
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:34,360
Music's gonna thrive on time

615
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,860
Can't you see, can't you see

616
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,860
I've been waiting for you

617
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:38,860
Can't you see baby

618
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:41,360
Music's gonna thrive on time

619
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:45,360
Don't you know, don't you know I've been waiting for you

620
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,360
Don't you know, baby, you could drive on time

621
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:51,360
Can't you see, can't you see I've been waiting for you

622
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:57,360
Can't you see, baby, you could fly on a right on time

623
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:18,040
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

624
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:24,140
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 146.

625
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:25,680
You want to have a contest to name your car?

626
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,680
We'll have a contest to name my car.

627
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,680
I thought you were going to name your car God.

628
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:36,680
No, because then I'd start calling it, you know, like, every so often, deity or Jesus or...

629
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,680
And when I say, oh my God, I'm usually not referring to your car.

630
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:43,680
But I have a friend who goes, oh my car.

631
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,680
Seriously, she goes, oh my car.

632
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:49,680
Wow. That's pretty awesome.

633
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,680
The bitch tickler is being suggested in the chat room.

634
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,680
That's okay. That's okay.

635
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,880
Wow, that sounds like a, um, like a hardcore band.

636
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,380
If someone can- Like an industrial band.

637
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:03,580
Live, it's Bitch Tickler!

638
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:07,680
If someone can suggest a name for my car

639
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,580
that fits in with my interests in my pretty, pretty car

640
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:14,680
with those stupid key skirts on it, then

641
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:18,680
you'll get something nice from me after I move. Maybe like a piece of the car?

642
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:22,120
No! Fuck no!

643
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,120
Mine!

644
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,120
How about a dust ball?

645
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:27,120
It's called My Car.

646
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,120
And nobody gets a part of it but me.

647
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,120
Alright.

648
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,120
My car.

649
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,120
We are-

650
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,120
What?

651
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,120
What?

652
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,120
What?

653
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,120
What?

654
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,120
What?

655
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,120
What?

656
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,120
Rob!

657
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,120
What?

658
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,120
My car!

659
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,120
Mine!

660
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,120
I waited a month!

661
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,120
Mine!

662
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:49,280
We're still going to be doing the Ultra Mix 3 song.

663
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,280
About 30 minutes.

664
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:55,160
for now let's talk about another dancing game series. In to Groove. In to Groove was released

665
00:48:55,160 --> 00:49:00,120
I guess this week. I don't get the whole In the Groove thing. You know what's funny? And

666
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:03,940
we went into both those game stores today and in both of them I completely neglected

667
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:10,120
to check to see if In the Groove was in stock because I just... We went into GameStop three

668
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:16,140
times and went into EB twice and none of those times did I bother to check for In the Groove

669
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:20,340
Because that just wasn't the thing that was on my mind today, I feel bad.

670
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:22,900
No, but, honest, you know, I

671
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:26,740
would probably pick up In the Groove because, you know, I'm a dance game whore.

672
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:31,060
But I don't have a PS2 American and I have yet to mod my Japanese one, so,

673
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:34,820
and I don't know if I want to mod my Japanese one because I'm afraid of fucking it up.

674
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:39,220
You'll fuck it up, don't do it. Exactly, so I think I'll just wait for the slim PS2.

675
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:43,180
Well, actually, I don't want to have a slim PS2 because I want one that can put a hard drive in it.

676
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:47,660
so I have to wait for those PS2's to come out. I already have it in the group. With all the suns unlocked.

677
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:48,460
You already got it?

678
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:52,700
Yeah, it's called Stepmania. I had it for years.

679
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:53,660
What the hell?

680
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:59,580
I'm not gonna buy it for the PlayStation 2. I already have it on PC for free.

681
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:02,580
Well, this is the weird thing I don't get is that In the Groove was supposed to be

682
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:03,580
released

683
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:08,980
what, June 17th, and then all of a sudden... Here's what it is. Surprise! It's by June 17th because

684
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:09,900
they realized

685
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:17,220
I don't think Red Octane has quite the shipping capability as, say, like EA, so they ship

686
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:19,780
as much as we can.

687
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:23,220
That's understandable, but it's kind of interesting, because it's not kind of what you're used

688
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:26,620
to seeing for video game releases, because usually it's like, okay, video games are going

689
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:30,020
to ship this day to shelve the next day.

690
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:33,140
The traditional game release always works like that, like if Zelda's going to come out,

691
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:35,340
you know it's going to ship and then shelve all that.

692
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:40,820
then Red Octane is just kind of like, well, in the groove, you know, it'll show up around

693
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:45,380
June 17th. Maybe you'll see it a little sooner, but June 17th will be the last one.

694
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:48,900
Actually, that's quite typical for games, except, you know.

695
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:49,900
Really?

696
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:54,820
Well, yeah, because it's like, yeah, this game will be out in the summer. Like, for

697
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:59,380
example, let's just talk about Psychonauts here. That game was supposed to be out around

698
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:04,200
May, and it's like coming out around July now, so it's been pushed back like four or

699
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:10,900
five times so it's not surprising they just said no we'll get to you whenever

700
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:16,020
so um because of the fact I don't have a ps2 American although I need to get one

701
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:22,140
because I want in the groove and I want extreme two for and we love katamari and

702
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:25,940
we are katamari you know and I got to pick up the dance games that I was

703
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:29,620
pretty much leeching from Loki when I lived there so I gotta pick all those up

704
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:34,020
again although I thought I owned one of those maybe not max 2 I think I did own

705
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:40,260
Max 2 at one point. I don't even know where it is. Isn't that sad? Anyway, so I got to

706
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:43,740
get a PS2 at some point. But in the meanwhile, those of you guys out there, you've already

707
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:49,620
been picking up copies of In the Groove and you've been posting to message boards about

708
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:56,780
what songs are being unlocked and when. And I believe, I'm trying to find out what the

709
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:04,620
hidden In The Groove 2 songs were here. Somebody had posted a complete list somewhere in here.

710
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:11,980
I'm looking through some threads over on itgfreak.com where they talk about In The Groove a lot.

711
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:17,900
Liquid Moon is one of the songs from In The Groove 2 that is in the game. And I want to

712
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:30,160
say tribal style is another one funk factory and incognito is that it or is

713
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:38,720
that in in the groove one I don't even know I'm sure somebody in the chat room

714
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:42,320
will be sure to correct me but I know folks folks over there were really

715
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:47,880
excited about getting to play some songs from In The Groove 2.

716
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:48,960
So that's kind of neat.

717
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:56,880
I do like how they did that, is that they brought back some songs that are going to

718
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,120
be in the next mix, like preview tracks, like they used to do the old DDRs.

719
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:02,560
So how many songs have I got on lockdown before the game is good?

720
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,440
You're ruthless.

721
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,520
I'm never going to buy that game.

722
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:18,720
Maybe if I get for free or something, but I'll never pay my hard-earned money for that crap.

723
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:23,440
Instead, I'll buy, like, Dog's Life 2 or something.

724
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,800
You're really bad.

725
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:31,120
I'm trying to go to one of my other resources I know has this on. There we go, yes, it's

726
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:35,080
Funk Factory by Money Deluxe, Incognito by Inspector K,

727
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:39,560
Tribal Style by Ka, and Kid whatever with Wake Up,

728
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:46,560
which apparently is getting really good reviews already so

729
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:49,820
and i'm being corrected uh... liquid moon is not a song from in the group to

730
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:53,300
it's just one of those ones that you could only play before in the non-stop

731
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:56,220
mode how would i know that i don't play enough

732
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:59,400
sorry to disappoint

733
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,740
apparently can unlock modifiers as well

734
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:04,200
uh... bumpy i think was one of them

735
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:09,600
Does it have a modifier to make it a good game?

736
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:13,440
I hear it has link mode with DDR, but they're not similar.

737
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,880
Don't worry.

738
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:19,480
Or does it have pump it up mode?

739
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:23,320
Well, it does have hand plants, so I guess it's sort of similar.

740
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:29,600
Does it have we are under the bedsheets with Endemero mode?

741
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,920
No.

742
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,540
Damn!

743
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:36,220
Some folks in Chat Room were talking about before the show that In the Groove 2 is out

744
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:42,340
and about apparently is starting to make its way out towards arcades, which kind of lines

745
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:46,460
up with some chat that's been going on on the various web forums saying that In the

746
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:51,460
Groove 2 is supposed to be shipping in this time frame early June, so In the Groove 2

747
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:53,540
could be coming to an arcade near you.

748
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:58,420
I haven't heard if it's new cabinets and the whole works or what.

749
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:05,420
I'd imagine the Boxor thing had to go away, but there'd be no clear answer to the Boxor.

750
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:12,420
Yippee! Oh my god, I can't wait! Oh, The Groove 2! It would be so much... Nope, sorry. Sucks.

751
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:18,420
Well, look, I know you don't give a shit, and I know you don't give a shit, but there

752
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:22,820
are people out there in the community that do care, so I'm just trying to report on their

753
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:26,260
behalf, because from what I'm hearing, one of the folks in the chat room was talking

754
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:30,140
me about In the Groove 2 before the show, and was saying that it's very polished, like

755
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:34,260
it's much more polished, and now we get characters...

756
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:40,460
You know, you can buy boots at the thrift store and polish them up, but it still means,

757
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:42,580
you know, there's still boots from the thrift store.

758
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:48,540
Yes, ooh, characters! Yes, there's hot new characters named Paige and Shemy in the game.

759
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:52,060
We need Mr. Spanky! I'm kidding, I completely made that up. Don't

760
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:59,640
in the hate mail please all right so in the groove twos out and apparently it's

761
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:06,100
really polished and all the songs from in the groove one and then some including

762
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:12,100
some DDR crossovers like Bambi and just some crazy stuff and novice modes in it

763
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:16,420
now so should be interesting and maybe might change some of your guys's mind on

764
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:21,300
in the groove Loki gonna give in the group to a try you got to be fair come

765
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,700
You gotta be fair and balanced.

766
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:26,300
Will you at least take a piss on it if it caught on fire?

767
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,300
Stop it. Stop encouraging him.

768
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:34,300
Fine, I'll look at it, but it's gonna be the same damn game.

769
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,800
It's like, ooh, it's like red now.

770
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,300
But it's a pretty new cabinet.

771
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:41,300
But it's a new cabinet, and the fact that it's in a new cabinet means it's not DDR anymore, right?

772
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:42,300
Because that's what everybody...

773
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:46,800
That's what I'm reading on the interweb, is that it's in a new cabinet, so it's not the same game anymore.

774
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,800
Actually, that's exactly what it means, because you know what?

775
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:53,960
cabinets have this thing called jamma meaning i can put pac-man game in a

776
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:57,720
normal stand-up cabinet or i could put pac-man game in a driving cabinet or i

777
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:01,480
can put pac-man game in a goddamn guitar freaks cabinet it's still the same

778
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,960
fucking game doesn't matter what kind of cabinet

779
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:08,040
you put it in you know what it's like i just said in the chat room you know the

780
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:12,920
first in the group was basically shit but shit makes the flowers grow so maybe

781
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:16,440
if we bury this shit it'll grow something good you know the chat room is

782
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,440
I'm not pleased with this track of conversation.

783
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,440
Guess what? Too fucking bad.

784
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:23,440
There's about five people here saying stop hating.

785
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,440
Too.

786
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:25,440
Too.

787
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,440
Boo hoo.

788
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,440
I said I'd give it a try.

789
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:35,440
The first one had good music, but it was just DDR, only crappy.

790
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,440
I tried the first one and it sucked ass. The end.

791
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,440
It was, yeah, it was DDR, only crappy.

792
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:41,440
And...

793
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,440
I can't wait to see the review on X-Play.

794
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:45,440
I want to see the next one.

795
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:49,720
I can't wait to see it. Apparently it's been getting decent reviews. It's getting around

796
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:54,280
the same scores. I don't know on what planet In the Groove looks better than DDR because

797
00:57:54,280 --> 00:58:00,080
it like gave me eye strain after one song. And I never got eye strain on DDR. Whatever,

798
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:05,280
you know. For the record, I'm still of the school of thought here where In the Groove

799
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:10,200
is just another dance game to me. I don't hate it, but I don't love it. Again, it's

800
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:14,060
not as good as the fanboys say it is, but it's not as bad as the haters say it is. That

801
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:17,420
include you guys sorry but I don't think it's as bad as you guys make it out to

802
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:24,860
be I appreciate the effort it was bad I just said it was kind of not good I

803
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:30,580
appreciate the effort they're trying to put into reviving the dance game

804
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:36,820
community but I just think they made some mistakes along the way but that's

805
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:42,260
okay I would have made mistakes too so we've made mistakes doing a radio

806
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:59,260
It happens. So, anyway, if you are a fan of In the Groove, which apparently there are quite a few of you out there listening, because we're getting hate mail already, pick it up. It's out in stores at least by June 17th. It'll be there. But you might have it already. We just don't know because they're shipping it randomly.

807
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:06,260
In the Groove is only surviving the arcades because there's no new DDR. That's the only thing. Once new DDR comes out, buh-bye.

808
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:12,100
You know it's like I could take my hair and dye it purple does it change the fact it's going to grow back brown

809
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,300
so you can't

810
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,700
You know take DDR add

811
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:21,820
Modifiers to it. It's still gonna. You know always play like DDR

812
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:26,700
Whatever I'm done. I don't know right good I

813
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:30,740
Still am gonna harass people at Best Buy though. Oh

814
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:34,340
Oh yeah, they're doing this live tour thing, right?

815
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:38,860
What's going on? Oh yeah, live tour, woo!

816
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:41,580
You know what's interesting, and if you want to find out more information about

817
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:45,940
this live in the groove tour or whatever they're doing, there is actually a website

818
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:49,660
on MySpace, and this is interesting because this goes beyond just dancing

819
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:52,820
games. I know we usually talk about mostly dancing games in the three hour

820
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:53,620
show here, but

821
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:56,780
this whole MySpace trend for promoting your games

822
00:59:56,780 --> 01:00:00,180
has gone beyond just the dance games recently.

823
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:04,320
Donkey Konga 2 has its own MySpace now which I think is very

824
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:07,960
I don't know, interesting? If that's the word to describe it.

825
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:11,840
We actually posted the links to both of these on our website earlier this week

826
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:16,880
not just the Donkey Konga 2 one but also a link to the Red Octane page on MySpace

827
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:21,040
and Red Octane has their own little section of MySpace.com

828
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:25,380
and in

829
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:29,980
the MySpace they actually have posted all their live shows that they're gonna do

830
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:33,820
because they're actually going to tour in the groove around, and I think this probably

831
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:38,440
has to do with the fact that you remember on DER Freak a few weeks ago, they were putting

832
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:42,580
out a call to, they wanted, they were going to hire, I don't know, Fly Girls or something

833
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:46,480
that were going to be promoting this game, helping to promote the game. Well, they're

834
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:52,860
going out on tour, and the tour kicks off June 24th at the Best Buy in Dublin, and then

835
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:57,700
it goes on to Santa Rosa on the 25th, Roseville, which is the one near us, on the 26th, which

836
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:01,900
is my birthday by the way, which means I'm especially not going to be there and it has

837
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:05,340
nothing to do with like or dislike for In the Groove but I'm actually going on a company

838
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:07,180
trip so I can't be there.

839
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:09,780
Yeah, he's trying to get as far away from In the Groove as possible.

840
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:10,780
Yeah, right.

841
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:15,460
So it's going to roll through most of California, making stops at Anime Expo on July 4th and

842
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:21,780
San Diego Comic Con on July 17th, stopping along some various Best Buy stores on the

843
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:22,780
way.

844
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:27,140
And then it's going to roll through some other conventions, no other Best Buy stores yet

845
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:30,220
So if you're not in a Best Buy in California, sorry you're out of luck, but they're going

846
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:35,460
to various conventions throughout August, September, October and November, including

847
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:42,060
just a quick list here, Wizard World in Chicago, Otacon in Baltimore, Gen Con in Indianapolis,

848
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:49,780
Dragon Con in Atlanta, AWA also in Atlanta, Onicon in Houston, Wizard World in Arlington

849
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:51,840
and Gen Con in Anaheim.

850
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:58,700
when I thought anime expo couldn't get any worse I'm proven wrong so they will

851
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:01,780
be taking that out so if you want to try in the groove maybe you haven't played

852
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:06,180
yet don't take our word for it or not play the game yourself make your own

853
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:10,800
decisions you can go catch them out on the road and if you want to check out

854
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:15,860
the tour schedule to complete one for yourself www.myspace.com slash red

855
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:23,060
Octane, all one word. So there you have it. So it should be interesting, to say the

856
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:28,260
least. Alright, let's go ahead and we're gonna go to a quick break and then we're

857
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:31,460
gonna come back and we're going to talk a little bit about UltraMix 3,

858
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:35,660
specifically a brand new song in UltraMix 3. Also the cage match when we

859
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:40,940
come back a little later and some more stuff. We got more news for you guys when

860
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:45,540
we come back. In this break we'll do some music from 2DX. We'll start it off with

861
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:51,220
little bit of Setsugekka from tent style. We'll be back after this.

862
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:20,540
Yeah

863
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:25,540
Yeah

864
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:30,540
Yeah

865
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,540
Yeah

Hi.

Hi.

01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:06,440
Hi.

888
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:09,840
Hi.

889
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:13,280
Hi.

890
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:16,700
Hi.

891
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:20,140
Hi.

892
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:43,380
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because Real Radio makes Captain Jack cry.

893
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:49,940
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, music there in that break from the 2DX series.

894
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:58,580
it off was Ryu with Setsugekka from 2DX10 style, 2DX fist style consumer track C-R-A-C-K-ER

895
01:10:58,580 --> 01:11:05,820
by Guaashi and 2DX7 style 0-1 by Mr. T and finally 2DX Red, John Robinson, K-K-K.

896
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:10,420
That was the last one you heard there in that break.

897
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:12,900
Skypline is open, we decided we'd open it up a little bit.

898
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:18,700
We are going to be doing the brand new song from DDR UltraMix 3 very shortly here, but

899
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:23,700
I figured after that last little bit on, we were talking about the In the Groove home

900
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:28,580
version, I figured there might be somebody who might want to provide a counterpoint via

901
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:31,620
our Skype line, I don't know, so I am opening that up there.

902
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:36,500
If you want to join us on the Skype line, www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on the little

903
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:39,940
link that says, interact with us, and that's how you can call in on the Skype line.

904
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:40,940
But you know what?

905
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:44,480
I'm not sure how interactive people want to be tonight, because I'm not seeing a lot of

906
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,500
our listeners logged in to Skype right now.

907
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:47,500
They know I'm right.

908
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:50,980
say we have

909
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:55,420
well paris hilton chad is so outdated

910
01:11:55,420 --> 01:12:00,740
this is sad and I've got to admit it okay nelly was bored so she was watching

911
01:12:00,740 --> 01:12:04,700
get this um it was that uh

912
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:07,320
oh god chaotic

913
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:11,800
I saw way too many episodes of chaotic and what did it teach me it taught me

914
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:13,500
that britney spears is a whore

915
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:17,380
and I've already knew that britney spears is a whore but

916
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:18,940
She's just fucking like,

917
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:27,940
Oh, Kevin Vetterman! Oh, Kevin! Oh, Kevin! I've had sex three times today! Three times! I'm a fucking whore!

918
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:32,540
So that's, you know, basically what Chaotic is about. Now, I was reading just now

919
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:38,820
that Chaotic's actually going to be debuting a brand new Britney Spears video at the end of the show.

920
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:39,740
That's wonderful.

921
01:12:39,740 --> 01:12:44,900
So, you know, I figured I'd talk about that stuff. And I was watching the MTV Movie Awards.

922
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:48,540
I don't know why MTV was on all weekend, but again, that Skype line is open.

923
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:50,460
You don't have to talk about it in a group if you don't want to.

924
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:55,580
But they had Jimmy Fallon hosting, which he's not funny at all.

925
01:12:55,580 --> 01:13:00,380
And then they had Nicole Richie, she was actually interviewing people on the runway.

926
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:05,780
And it was really bad because she's just like, oh my god, you're so hot, oh my god.

927
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:07,980
And it was just completely stupid.

928
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:09,760
I really hated that show.

929
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,500
But for some reason, I watched it because I don't know.

930
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:17,500
If your girlfriend feels like she has to watch this shit, leave the room.

931
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:22,500
We're getting a call on Skype. Praise the Lord. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

932
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:27,500
Yeah, I think I was elected by the chat channel to call in and make him shut up.

933
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:32,500
Well, we will do so. Loki, shut up. Tell him to shut up.

934
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:35,500
Yeah, shut up, man.

935
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:37,500
So, what's on your mind?

936
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:45,580
Oh, drinking. Not much. Basically laughing at people as they bicker back and forth of

937
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:49,340
which dance game is better. I'm kind of the neutral party in this.

938
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:54,580
Now, you kind of came into listening to Orange Lawns Radio Live, I'm assuming from our podcast

939
01:13:54,580 --> 01:13:56,900
that we do, right? Where we talk about other video games?

940
01:13:56,900 --> 01:14:00,740
Actually, yeah. Somebody gave me one of the podcasts and I was like, hey, this sounds

941
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:04,460
pretty good. So I tuned in last week and just liked it.

942
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:07,820
Well, welcome to all our folks who've been listening to the podcast.

943
01:14:07,820 --> 01:14:11,020
We do do this three-hour show on Sunday nights, and since it kind of started

944
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:14,860
about Bamani and music video games and music-based things, we still talk about

945
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:17,260
them a whole awful lot here on this show, so

946
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:20,220
it's something you'll get used to. There are a lot of really good music games

947
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:23,740
out there, though. But we have been kind of trying to branch out as, you know,

948
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:26,060
as you kind of saw last week. We talk about, you know, just

949
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:29,900
whatever pop culture stuff, other video games we like, we, you know, get into all that.

950
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:33,900
Bringing up anything Nickelodeon is insanely cool with me.

951
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:38,420
That was kind of just a weird show last week when we just were getting into Nickelodeon,

952
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:43,180
but hey, cool with me, chat room scene to dig it, so I'm all cool with that again.

953
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:46,260
Pretty much anything old school in my book is really good.

954
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:52,300
And there's this whole like six degrees of separation thing going on because if you think

955
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:56,540
about it this way, you have Nickelodeon, you have that show Roundhouse, and then the guy

956
01:14:56,540 --> 01:15:01,740
on Roundhouse was the emcee at Konami's booth at E3 this year, showing off the new music

957
01:15:01,740 --> 01:15:02,740
games.

958
01:15:02,740 --> 01:15:08,740
We should figure out some kind of six degrees of separation with video games or something. There's bound to be a way to do it.

959
01:15:08,740 --> 01:15:12,740
Yes, we could connect anything back to, oh, we're really talking about Bemani, don't worry.

960
01:15:12,740 --> 01:15:15,740
But can we connect it to Kevin Bacon?

961
01:15:15,740 --> 01:15:16,740
Possibly.

962
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:18,740
Oh, jeez, not Kevin Bacon, come on.

963
01:15:18,740 --> 01:15:23,740
Did Kevin Bacon ever make like a guest spot at E3? Well, okay, maybe like Gary Coleman was at E3.

964
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:27,740
I don't know, was Gary Coleman and Kevin Bacon ever in a movie together?

965
01:15:27,740 --> 01:15:31,740
Gary Coleman was beating up people at the mall.

966
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:35,740
Did Kevin Bacon do that? I don't know.

967
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:39,740
Kevin Bacon has gone to a mall!

968
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:43,740
As a person who's calling in who isn't too familiar with the dance and music games,

969
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:47,740
what kind of news stories have been interesting you this week in the general gaming world?

970
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:51,740
General gaming world, I'd probably have to, well, GTA,

971
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:55,740
San Andreas is out on PC.

972
01:15:55,740 --> 01:15:58,160
I almost beat it and I just got it today.

973
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:01,320
Wow, had you played it on PlayStation 2 or any of that previously?

974
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:04,120
Uh, I played it on PlayStation 2 and hated it,

975
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:07,860
because it was just... it just didn't feel right to me, so I got it for PC instead.

976
01:16:07,860 --> 01:16:11,500
I've heard a lot of bitching about the controls in that game, and I've played a little bit of

977
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:15,200
San Andreas, but most of my San Andreas experience was watching Loki play,

978
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,640
because he's better at killing people than I am, let's just say this.

979
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,280
Let's play missions or a bitch.

980
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:23,240
Well, he also likes to load down the game with cheat codes, and then he'll just

981
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:26,680
skydive with no parachute. I don't know, what kind of stuff were you doing on those flying

982
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:30,880
missions? You used to, like, fly straight into the ground and all this crazy stuff.

983
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:34,920
I wasn't doing that. I don't remember. I just, you can actually chop up people with a propeller

984
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:39,720
if you're good enough. That's awesome. I would, but one thing I do remember from-

985
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:45,200
I would car surf and that was fun. One thing I do remember from San Andreas was

986
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:49,560
that the controls were a little, it was a lot for, like, a little controller. There's

987
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:52,920
so much you can do in that game that the controls get a little convoluted because there's so

988
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:57,140
much you can do with that controller. And I imagine if you can lay that out across a

989
01:16:57,140 --> 01:16:59,460
keyboard, it probably makes it a little more...

990
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:00,460
No.

991
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:01,460
Same.

992
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:02,460
You think? What do you think?

993
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:06,500
Well, yes and no. For the plane missions, having a joystick is very handy, except they

994
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:10,920
made it so incredibly touchy on the plane stuff. Like, you'll just tap it and you'll

995
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:13,140
automatically go craning towards the ground.

996
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:15,340
So like playing Top Gun on the NES?

997
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:16,780
It's all about...

998
01:17:16,780 --> 01:17:17,780
Exactly!

999
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:20,100
It's all about the train mission, or the trainers.

1000
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:30,100
You know, yeah, that's what I'm interested in because I remember watching you play Grand Theft Auto Vice City on the computer and there was that code where you could hit a button and you'd make a car rain down.

1001
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:38,100
No, basically what it was, it was, it was, um, I set one button, um, special moves, usually there's a code where you can do, um, make all the cars explode.

1002
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:46,100
So I mapped that to one key, held it down and all the cars rocket into the air, then you let go and start running and dodge the falling debris and that's awesome.

1003
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:47,100
See that's the kind of cool stuff...

1004
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:50,420
Or you can drop like tanks and then you just keep doing a line of tanks.

1005
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:52,820
Yeah tanks, that's a big tank pile.

1006
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:57,380
That's the kind of cool stuff that you can do in a game on the PC that's a little harder

1007
01:17:57,380 --> 01:17:58,380
on PlayStation.

1008
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:02,580
I mean they have a lot of these same codes on PlayStation but you can do more config

1009
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:06,580
and hacking and all that stuff on the PC so I think that's the real reason to be happy

1010
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:07,580
about it.

1011
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:09,460
You know what's quite funny is like up to like maybe last month or so they were still

1012
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:12,700
releasing new codes for Grand Theft Auto like in-game codes.

1013
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:15,700
Well that's a good way to keep your game going, you know, keep it alive a little bit.

1014
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:22,980
The console stuff, you can really go so far with it, but the PC, you always have where

1015
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:26,220
you can edit it and change it and add stuff to it.

1016
01:18:26,220 --> 01:18:31,900
Oh, I was seeing, I saw today on X-Play, they were talking about Grand Theft Auto, I see

1017
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:34,780
you had two player missions, you can make out with guys in that.

1018
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:35,780
Oh, hooray.

1019
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:36,780
Yeah, unfortunately.

1020
01:18:36,780 --> 01:18:40,300
They're talking about having a mini sex game in the PC version.

1021
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:42,780
Dark Sakura said the word sex, so I was interested here for that.

1022
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:43,780
The chat room's talking about it.

1023
01:18:43,780 --> 01:18:47,780
I haven't found out how to do it. I've been trying to find out how to do it.

1024
01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:52,780
What is up with the mini sex games lately? We had one in Fable. We had one in God of War.

1025
01:18:52,780 --> 01:18:55,780
It was written into the code but disabled.

1026
01:18:55,780 --> 01:18:59,780
It's written in the code but disabled for the PS2 version.

1027
01:18:59,780 --> 01:19:07,780
So if they just transferred that over to the PC, I'm sure someone will be able to find the way to, you know, get rid of that so you can actually have sex.

1028
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:12,780
Who cares? It's stupid. I mean, have you ever watched Hooker have sex with you in the car?

1029
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:16,780
All it is is the car rocking and she's sitting there, it's just great.

1030
01:19:16,780 --> 01:19:23,780
You can always do the really old sex joke and playing River City Ransom, you walk behind the girls in the mall and make it look like you're humping them from behind.

1031
01:19:23,780 --> 01:19:26,780
Dude, can you post those pictures in our chatroom, DarkSakura? They might get a kick out of that.

1032
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:27,780
I think those are fake.

1033
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:28,780
Are they fake?

1034
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:29,780
I think they're fake.

1035
01:19:29,780 --> 01:19:30,780
Oh, they are fake.

1036
01:19:30,780 --> 01:19:32,780
Aw, man, you had me going for a minute.

1037
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:33,780
They are funny.

1038
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:34,780
Post them anyway.

1039
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:35,780
Alright.

1040
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:41,780
Well, Reznor, we gotta let you go because we're going to get to a song premiere that the Dance Game folks really want to hear.

1041
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:43,860
All right, well, you have a good one, all right?

1042
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:44,360
You too.

1043
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:45,520
All right, thanks for calling.

1044
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:46,500
Later.

1045
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:47,980
All right.

1046
01:19:47,980 --> 01:19:48,820
This is interesting.

1047
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:50,900
Now we've got folks that are tuning in that aren't

1048
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:52,180
used to the dance game stuff.

1049
01:19:52,180 --> 01:19:54,780
So we've got to talk about the other stuff, too.

1050
01:19:54,780 --> 01:19:55,620
But that's all right.

1051
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:56,580
I like all games.

1052
01:19:56,580 --> 01:19:58,340
We're game fans first, dance game seconds.

1053
01:19:58,340 --> 01:20:00,500
All right, let's talk about those dance games.

1054
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:02,820
We promised you about now we'd be talking about the brand

1055
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:05,460
new DDR Ultra Mix 3 song.

1056
01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:09,060
Now, I told you guys earlier that Miklotov, even though

1057
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:11,120
he's here, you might have forgot he was here, because

1058
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:12,880
He's actually been playing the blue DS over there.

1059
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:13,880
He can't stop playing.

1060
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:14,880
Hi, Miklotov.

1061
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:15,880
How you doing?

1062
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:16,880
It's a mod.

1063
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,880
It's a mod you can download.

1064
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:19,880
Oh.

1065
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:20,880
Dark Sakura says the second...

1066
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:24,880
I did a little bit of digging on this, and apparently it's a mod you download.

1067
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,400
All right.

1068
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:30,480
Let's get to the dance thing, though, because they're impatient as it is.

1069
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:31,480
All right.

1070
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:35,800
Even though Miklotov here, he is not revealing this to you guys.

1071
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:40,120
He's under NDA, so he can't talk about it.

1072
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:44,920
But who can talk about it and who can talk about when their songs are in the games are

1073
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:47,320
the artists themselves.

1074
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:52,360
And sure enough, if you remember last year when DDR UltraMix II was coming out, we had

1075
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:59,800
TOY, I believe on his website, he had announced he was doing songs for DDR, Alien613 or whoever

1076
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:03,560
had announced they were doing a song for DDR, and they put the background of the song on

1077
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:04,560
their site.

1078
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:05,560
I don't know how they got that.

1079
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:11,920
Do you remember any other folks that announced their songs on their website before the rest

1080
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:13,840
of us found out about it?

1081
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:19,760
I remember it wasn't necessarily announcing songs that they did, but I believe Big Idea

1082
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:24,760
and Jesper Kidd or Kied both said that they were doing stuff for UltraMix on their websites

1083
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:30,120
last year, and lo and behold, apparently artists are doing it again this year.

1084
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:36,320
Alright, so, I know you're all dying to find out what the song is, but I want to remind

1085
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:42,400
you real quick that this ties into an ongoing theme we've had going on for a couple weeks

1086
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,400
here on the show.

1087
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:47,440
Loki just found it on the page here, he's laughing.

1088
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:52,800
Loki, what is the theme that it's tying into here on the show?

1089
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:59,800
I don't know, I can't trouble me with that stuff because I'm so very sad.

1090
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:09,400
Are you feeling tragic? I'm so tragic. Oh my god, I am so tragic.

1091
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:13,560
Oh, my tortured existence. Alright, if you haven't figured it out yet,

1092
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:18,640
the theme that this song relates to is our gothic talking that we've been doing for the

1093
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:21,660
past few weeks here. The artist...

1094
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:24,100
Because girls' butts have a lot to do with being God.

1095
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:27,460
Yeah, everybody in our chat room was rooting for girls' butts. Sorry guys, this actually

1096
01:22:27,460 --> 01:22:31,860
ties into another joke. I couldn't believe it when I found this. The artist that is doing

1097
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:37,120
this song is called Spray, and the song is called I Am Gothic, and they are claiming

1098
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:46,120
on their website, I'm going to quote from their website, their site is over at www.spraynet.freeserve.co.uk

1099
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:55,800
And I quote from the page, there's a section here that says DDR, whilst spray's dream of

1100
01:22:55,800 --> 01:23:01,520
sound tracking something by ultimate play the game may never materialize, we have the

1101
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:08,040
genuinely exciting news that DDR UltraMix 3 on the Xbox will feature I am gothic, the

1102
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:10,440
2003 single mix.

1103
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:13,940
So we have a song by the artist spray called I am gothic, we're going to play them, it's

1104
01:23:13,940 --> 01:23:17,900
actually available on the internet we got it off iTunes you can buy the song

1105
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:23,060
on iTunes we're gonna play it for you guys right now I guess ready for this

1106
01:23:23,060 --> 01:23:27,800
now remember this is not the DDR edit this song is actually kind of long

1107
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:31,880
remember that the song is going to be edited down for DDR when they actually

1108
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:36,420
put it in the game so this song actually clocks in at six minutes and 30 seconds

1109
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:41,500
so it's a little bit long but I think if you listen to it you can kind of tell

1110
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:46,480
what parts will be in the game you don't you don't have to be me glitov to know

1111
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:49,260
that you will probably able to guess all right here it is the orange andre do

1112
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:54,340
premiere of a brand new song announced by the artist on their website for DDR

1113
01:23:54,340 --> 01:24:01,340
Ultramix 3. Spray. I am gothic.

1114
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:38,340
Death inside, candlelight, night is there in gloom

1115
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:42,340
I'm just now cruising, I'm considered a dream

1116
01:25:42,340 --> 01:25:45,340
So far it's dark, can't you feel my pain?

1117
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:49,340
All are all the same, say I should make my way

1118
01:25:49,340 --> 01:25:56,340
Cast a ghost brain to the center of my heart

1119
01:25:56,340 --> 01:26:01,340
I am hopeless and found

1120
01:26:03,340 --> 01:26:07,340
I am selfish, I am frail

1121
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:10,340
I am scary, I am sane

1122
01:26:10,340 --> 01:26:14,340
I am loner, I am cold

1123
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:18,340
I feel special when people come following me

1124
01:26:44,340 --> 01:27:09,700
I don't like your band, I don't put any effort in it, it's just how I am, I'm disturbed,

1125
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:12,200
I feel hurt, I'm intense, that's me

1126
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:16,200
Writing poetry in ecstasy

1127
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:23,200
I'm a mythic before I study the above

1128
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:30,200
Just admit you're terrified

1129
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:33,700
I am conflict, I am hell

1130
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:37,200
I am scary, I'm insane

1131
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:44,200
I'm a loner, I am cold, I feel faster when people go cold

1132
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:51,200
I am perfect, I am fair, I am scary, I am sane

1133
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:59,200
I'm a loner, I am cold, I feel better when people come for me

1134
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:24,680
I am public, I am pale, I am scary, I don't study, I'm a loner, I am cold, I see a factor

1135
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:26,680
When people throw songs

1136
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:28,680
I am coming

1137
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:30,680
I am terrible

1138
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:32,680
I am scary

1139
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:34,680
I'm insane

1140
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:36,680
I'm a loser

1141
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:38,680
I am cold

1142
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:40,680
I am the best

1143
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:42,680
I am the best

1144
01:28:42,680 --> 01:29:11,680
I am dolphin, I am cradle, I am scary

1145
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:17,680
I am scary, I am strange, I am wrong, I am cold

1146
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:21,680
I feel better when people don't know

1147
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:27,680
I am complex, I am dead, I am scary, I am strange

1148
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:31,680
I am loner, I am whole

1149
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:36,680
I didn't think you'd let me go, don't you?

1150
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:19,380
The world premiere here on Orange Lounge Radio, that brand new song from DDR UltraMix 3 as

1151
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:25,760
announced by the artist on their website, Spray with I Am Gothic, the 2003 single mix.

1152
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:27,880
Alright, so there you have it.

1153
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:31,340
Now remember that that song, if you thought it was a little long, don't forget that they

1154
01:30:31,340 --> 01:30:36,580
do edit those songs down when they're put into DDR, so if you thought it was long, don't

1155
01:30:36,580 --> 01:30:40,260
worry, they're going to cut out some of the extra parts there and just have the meat of

1156
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:43,420
the song in the game.

1157
01:30:43,420 --> 01:30:45,300
So Loki, what did you think?

1158
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:46,300
I am gothic.

1159
01:30:46,300 --> 01:30:47,300
It was okay.

1160
01:30:47,300 --> 01:30:48,300
Yeah?

1161
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:49,300
Okay?

1162
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:51,420
It was okay.

1163
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:52,420
It's okay.

1164
01:30:52,420 --> 01:30:59,580
I was laughing my ass off when I found out about this a little earlier this week because,

1165
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:02,700
That's because of how it fits into everything we've been talking about on the show lately.

1166
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:03,700
I know.

1167
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:04,700
I was cracking up.

1168
01:31:04,700 --> 01:31:05,700
We're psychic.

1169
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:09,620
Anyway, the artist spray, I actually think they are very funny.

1170
01:31:09,620 --> 01:31:12,060
Here's the interesting thing about the band Spray.

1171
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:16,700
I was kind of perusing through their website where they announced this fact that they're

1172
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:18,700
going to be in DDR Ultra Mix 3.

1173
01:31:18,700 --> 01:31:25,300
And if you look at it and they talk about who they are, they are related to Ricky and

1174
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:30,620
Daz, who were formerly, let's see, Ricky and Daz were Space Cats, right?

1175
01:31:30,620 --> 01:31:33,140
You've got to help me out here, because I can't keep trying to realize this.

1176
01:31:33,140 --> 01:31:37,900
Ricky and Daz were Space Cats, and then Space Cats used to be Bus Stop at one point, right?

1177
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:43,460
So believe it or not, can we get him a mic, look, give him a mic.

1178
01:31:43,460 --> 01:31:44,460
So wait, am I right here?

1179
01:31:44,460 --> 01:31:46,700
Ricky and Daz were Space Cats who were Bus Stop.

1180
01:31:46,700 --> 01:31:47,700
Yes, exactly.

1181
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:48,700
Right.

1182
01:31:48,700 --> 01:31:49,700
Now here's the deal.

1183
01:31:49,700 --> 01:31:54,020
Ricky, it says Ricardo, who is one of the folks that's in this band, Spray, is one half

1184
01:31:54,020 --> 01:31:59,380
of pop production legends Ricky and Daz. Funny thing about Ricky and Daz, they're actually

1185
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:04,820
showing up in Neon FM with the Rhinestone Cowboy song. So it's really weird how this

1186
01:32:04,820 --> 01:32:10,200
is all relating together, but when I kind of tie that to Bus Stop, it's like, wow, because

1187
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:14,480
that song sounded nothing like anything you would ever expect to hear from Bus Stop, so

1188
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:19,660
that's very interesting. I was having the Sandstorm flashback, so...

1189
01:32:19,660 --> 01:32:25,260
Zachary you weren't a big fan of the song or it's all right it just generic

1190
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:28,820
well don't forget that it's gonna get cut down a little bit as well so it'll

1191
01:32:28,820 --> 01:32:34,340
be even more generic no but the parts that go on and on will be cut down okay

1192
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:39,100
I didn't care for much of it honestly I mean it was okay I'd listen to it in the

1193
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:43,760
background but I've heard better hmm I I'm totally digging it I think it's

1194
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:48,860
gonna be probably one of the songs that's as hot as skulk in the mix I

1195
01:32:48,860 --> 01:32:53,240
I don't know, maybe I'm just being premature, because I mean, we don't know that many songs

1196
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:54,860
in the mix yet, but I don't know.

1197
01:32:54,860 --> 01:32:57,780
We found out Skulk pretty early last year too, and that turned out to be one of the

1198
01:32:57,780 --> 01:32:58,780
best songs.

1199
01:32:58,780 --> 01:32:59,780
Skulk.

1200
01:32:59,780 --> 01:33:01,380
Bib Spray is my new echo image right now.

1201
01:33:01,380 --> 01:33:02,380
Really?

1202
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:03,380
Yeah.

1203
01:33:03,380 --> 01:33:04,380
Awesome.

1204
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:05,380
You know me, and you know me and Echo Image.

1205
01:33:05,380 --> 01:33:07,040
Yeah, that's pretty big.

1206
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:10,440
Some of the lyrics in the song, let me read you some of the lyrics from I Am Gothic.

1207
01:33:10,440 --> 01:33:13,300
Step inside, candle lights in my depressing gloom.

1208
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:17,180
I'm just no brooding teen, I'm considered abstruse.

1209
01:33:17,180 --> 01:33:20,780
so spares being dark can't you feel my pain people are all the same they

1210
01:33:20,780 --> 01:33:24,940
isolate my ways catch the ghost train to the center of my heart then the dark

1211
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:29,020
will rise again I am potent I'm profound then the clouds will part here's the

1212
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:34,540
chorus I am gothic I am pale I am scary I'm insane I'm a loner I am cold I feel

1213
01:33:34,540 --> 01:33:40,700
special when people don't phone yay so I can't I can't get it is it like there

1214
01:33:40,700 --> 01:33:49,960
They're satire of goth bands or are they poking fun at themselves or what?

1215
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:50,960
I don't know.

1216
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:55,600
I think it's just a satire because anything that's synthpop is now seeming to be labeled

1217
01:33:55,600 --> 01:34:00,920
as goth and they are definitely synthpop so they might be making fun of that.

1218
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:04,040
Actually I went ahead, I like that song so much actually, I really really dug that song

1219
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:08,440
so I liked it so much I went and bought the album which they also have available on iTunes

1220
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:09,980
and there's some great songs on there.

1221
01:34:09,980 --> 01:34:13,480
They also have a song called, now see Jamie would like this, and she's not in the room

1222
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:14,480
right now.

1223
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:15,480
I'll have to tell her when she comes back.

1224
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:20,480
But they have a song called, I Kill With My Car.

1225
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:21,480
Read a lyric.

1226
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:23,280
You want to hear a lyric from I Kill With My Car?

1227
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:28,600
Rubber on tarmac, grip the wheel, cold chrome heartbeat, stainless steel, come on baby,

1228
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:34,620
take that step, in front of me in certain death, I kill with my car.

1229
01:34:34,620 --> 01:34:38,680
And then there's another great song on there called, Fashion Stigmata.

1230
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:44,600
Stigmata is great because it has singing children in it. Yeah, little British children that sing.

1231
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:48,520
Let me play, I guess I'll play little clips of these songs here real quick. Let me play

1232
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:55,520
like a little clip of I kill with my car here, so you guys can get a feel for this.

1233
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:12,920
You see where that, I don't know, it strikes me as like, I want to see like an old woman

1234
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:17,620
driving a car with that blaring on... They're poking fun at the goth thing, but they're

1235
01:35:17,620 --> 01:35:22,000
goth themselves so it's like they're just I don't know I think Jamie said

1236
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,100
something when she was in here earlier it kind of seemed to make sense it's

1237
01:35:24,100 --> 01:35:27,880
like they are making fun of how people make fun of goths or something I don't

1238
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:33,640
know other song titles on the CD I keep missing the love boat and leave it to

1239
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:41,140
the girls boys all right one more little clip for you guys here this is from that

1240
01:35:41,140 --> 01:35:45,000
fashion stigmata song because I think this song is freaking funny fashion

1241
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:52,000
I'll try and get a clip.

1242
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Give all your body, that's how it's all wrong

1243
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:00,000
We're just a few friends, we're just a few friends

1244
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Give all your body, that's how it's all wrong

1245
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Oh, God, well, she could get really quite the same

1246
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Collections change, my scars are made, and my knees are now out of shape

1247
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,000
And I'm being sued by

1248
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Alright, so there you go.

1249
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
I just can't get into this.

1250
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,000
You can't get into it?

1251
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:21,000
No, I like the titles, but I just can't get into the songs. They're awful.

1252
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:25,180
awful. You know, we had to look... It's like an Uwe Voll movie. I mean, come on. It's like,

1253
01:36:25,180 --> 01:36:29,720
it's like... Oh, that's harsh. That is harsh. It's like a good concept, but executed poorly.

1254
01:36:29,720 --> 01:36:34,560
No, it's awesome. What's great is that they have a song called Child of the 80s, which

1255
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:38,420
is very similar to the I Am Gothic song, because it's like poking fun at like, you know, reminiscing

1256
01:36:38,420 --> 01:36:42,480
of the 80s and everything. And we could have sworn when we were listening to the song for

1257
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:45,760
the first time that it was saying, suddenly everybody rapes me because I'm a child of

1258
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:51,120
the 80s but it's actually rates me it's where that little accent comes into play

1259
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:56,920
all right so there you go there you have it I hope you enjoyed check them out I

1260
01:36:56,920 --> 01:37:02,160
personally recommend the band spray but it really depends on you know what you

1261
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:06,720
want make a talk I don't know is there anything you can tell us further about

1262
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:11,240
spray probably not but only personal thoughts on the band but you know I

1263
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:14,920
think they're my new echo image which means they're awesome and you can't say

1264
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:21,920
anything about him in the game, huh? NDA. Which is a yes! Which is a yes! Oh frat!

1265
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:27,200
Apparently I can say something. You can neither confirm or deny what they're saying on the

1266
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:32,040
website. Exactly. Well, I'm going to confirm it. No idiot would say that their song is

1267
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:36,720
in CD-R and then it's suddenly not there because they would look ass-tastic. But at least they

1268
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:41,960
got their song played on our cruddy little show, so hey! That's true. That's true. But

1269
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:45,060
it makes sense. I mean, I don't know if this is like a different drum because they're technically

1270
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:48,600
not on the different drum label. They're on this ninth wave records. I think it was ninth

1271
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:51,480
wave. I want to say what's the name of the label. They're on some different type of record

1272
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:54,840
label. So it's technically not a different drum. So it makes me think it's a license

1273
01:37:54,840 --> 01:38:01,440
song. And you can't tell me. You're no help as to which one it is. But I kind of see if

1274
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:07,200
it is a license song. If we're following that little six degrees of DDR here going from

1275
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:11,520
bus stop to Space Cats to Ricky and Daz to Spray, it makes sense

1276
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:18,320
how we ended up from point A to point B. So, there we go.

1277
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:21,240
I'm curious what our chat room folks thought of that.

1278
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:22,760
They probably hate it.

1279
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:27,020
They're fickle. Some folks were saying...

1280
01:38:27,020 --> 01:38:31,480
They were talking about Max in there. What?

1281
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:34,960
We did not pay attention, chat room. People don't come to the chat room to actually listen to the show.

1282
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:42,740
They go there to talk about, you know, other stuff, but, yeah, interesting.

1283
01:38:42,740 --> 01:38:45,740
This reminds me of Bloodhound Gang's Discovery Channel song.

1284
01:38:45,740 --> 01:38:46,740
Who said that?

1285
01:38:46,740 --> 01:38:48,380
Reznor, this guy, just called us in there.

1286
01:38:48,380 --> 01:38:49,380
No, I don't know who he is.

1287
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:51,860
I guess I can't make fun of him if I don't know who he is.

1288
01:38:51,860 --> 01:38:55,620
But you did say earlier, when we were listening to this album in the car, you said it sounded

1289
01:38:55,620 --> 01:38:58,100
like Eiffel 65, who did a remix of that song.

1290
01:38:58,100 --> 01:39:02,740
One of the songs, the very first track on the CD, sounds a lot like Eiffel 65, and it's

1291
01:39:02,740 --> 01:39:06,980
It's not a bad thing, because if you got over Blue, and you actually had their CD, it was

1292
01:39:06,980 --> 01:39:09,180
a pretty good CD.

1293
01:39:09,180 --> 01:39:10,180
So...

1294
01:39:10,180 --> 01:39:11,180
Alright.

1295
01:39:11,180 --> 01:39:13,880
Hi, Dark Sakura.

1296
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:16,160
You missed our chat about the band...

1297
01:39:16,160 --> 01:39:17,160
Good.

1298
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:18,160
No.

1299
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:19,160
They have a song.

1300
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:20,160
I was waiting for you.

1301
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:25,000
I was busy holding back the flood and getting two of every animal.

1302
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Okay.

1303
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,320
I know it.

1304
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:30,800
There's a song called, I Kill With My Car.

1305
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:31,800
I need that.

1306
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:33,800
See? He was telling me about it.

1307
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:35,800
I knew she would come around as soon as she found out about it.

1308
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:37,800
Your roommate was telling me about it.

1309
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:44,800
I'm sorry listeners, but I have to do this for Jamie. I have to play the clip again, you guys. I have to do this.

1310
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:51,800
and

1311
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:06,620
i'd like to know a whole lot of candy that so maybe it's just the remix it

1312
01:40:06,620 --> 01:40:10,880
because that was a remix the one that's gonna be an area that he stands for me

1313
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:14,880
that the original version of song is amazing it's it's uh... very what you

1314
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:18,040
say in the car edward scissor happened yeah i think that i think that the

1315
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:23,540
beginning of the song i don't think that sounds like a good time

1316
01:40:23,540 --> 01:40:28,020
at the original something else against me

1317
01:40:28,020 --> 01:40:31,540
now the president of the inner charity should just name your car killer i mean

1318
01:40:31,540 --> 01:40:33,900
it's still the death of the right

1319
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:37,020
all right enough about the band spray report about enough but we hope they

1320
01:40:37,020 --> 01:40:42,300
enjoy their 15 minutes while being in DDR. But you know what? Really, I haven't heard

1321
01:40:42,300 --> 01:40:47,980
an album that made me laugh and just... I just really liked it. I really did. It's everything

1322
01:40:47,980 --> 01:40:52,060
I like about music. It was synth-pop and it was funny. I mean, seriously, how can you

1323
01:40:52,060 --> 01:40:56,460
go wrong? They have a song about, it sounded like being a stalker and then committing suicide

1324
01:40:56,460 --> 01:41:03,220
and killing the other guy as well so you could be together forever. And that was pretty awesome.

1325
01:41:03,220 --> 01:41:09,820
Alright, let's go to a break, and in this break, I'm in a very Akira mood this break,

1326
01:41:09,820 --> 01:41:14,660
so I think we need to do some Akira Yamoka this break, so we're gonna do that, and then

1327
01:41:14,660 --> 01:41:17,380
we're gonna come back and get into this nice cage match, and we'll take another call on

1328
01:41:17,380 --> 01:41:20,500
Skype, if anybody's willing to call in, so I'll take a poll and chat and see if somebody

1329
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:21,740
wants to call in on Skype.

1330
01:41:21,740 --> 01:41:25,560
We'll take your calls, get to the cage match, get to the FUs of the week, and all the other

1331
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:28,460
gaming news we can dig up after this break.

1332
01:41:28,460 --> 01:41:29,460
Akira!

1333
01:41:59,460 --> 01:42:02,460
Take a look at me, I'm a virgin

1334
01:42:02,460 --> 01:42:06,460
Look at you, I don't want to make you feel

1335
01:42:06,460 --> 01:42:08,460
I'm all built for being a bitch

1336
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:10,460
And I'm making up a deal

1337
01:42:10,460 --> 01:42:14,460
How do you feel?

1338
01:42:14,460 --> 01:42:21,460
Let me through, let me through

1339
01:42:21,460 --> 01:42:32,860
Hello, you and I, we love you, we love you

1340
01:42:32,860 --> 01:42:36,660
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday

1341
01:42:36,660 --> 01:42:38,660
With the cynical boom in the back

1342
01:42:38,660 --> 01:42:41,860
I say Friday, Saturday, every day

1343
01:42:41,860 --> 01:43:05,860
Let me do, let me lose

1344
01:43:05,860 --> 01:43:10,860
Let me do, let me lose

1345
01:43:10,860 --> 01:43:24,860
Oh, you make love more like me, more like me

1346
01:44:40,860 --> 01:44:42,860
Are you here now?

1347
01:47:10,860 --> 01:47:29,860
This got too forever, the grain blast blows and the wind is dancing

1348
01:47:29,860 --> 01:47:36,860
It would be a much better fight, with you, with me

1349
01:47:36,860 --> 01:47:43,860
If you hadn't met me, I'd be fine on my own, baby

1350
01:47:43,860 --> 01:47:48,860
Never felt so lonely then you came along

1351
01:47:48,860 --> 01:47:52,860
So now what should I do?

1352
01:47:52,860 --> 01:47:55,860
I'm strung out, addicted to you

1353
01:47:55,860 --> 01:47:59,860
My body aches, now that you're gone

1354
01:47:59,860 --> 01:48:03,860
My supplies settle through

1355
01:48:03,860 --> 01:48:08,860
And they gave me everything you had and more

1356
01:48:08,860 --> 01:48:10,860
You craved my happiness

1357
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:13,860
When you made me feel a toy in me

1358
01:48:13,860 --> 01:48:17,860
Just smile, but now I feel your stress

1359
01:48:17,860 --> 01:48:19,860
Love was never meant to be

1360
01:48:19,860 --> 01:48:22,860
Such a crazy affair, no

1361
01:48:22,860 --> 01:48:24,860
And who has time for tears?

1362
01:48:24,860 --> 01:48:26,860
Never thought I'd sit around

1363
01:48:26,860 --> 01:48:30,860
Round and round all your love

1364
01:49:00,860 --> 01:49:05,500
it you missed it we premiered a brand new song from DDR UltraMix 3 it was

1365
01:49:05,500 --> 01:49:09,220
spray I am gothic when we were talking about the band spray for a little while

1366
01:49:09,220 --> 01:49:15,420
and maybe after after like at the very very end after the afterbirth we'll play

1367
01:49:15,420 --> 01:49:18,020
it one more time for those of you guys that missed it so stick with us and

1368
01:49:18,020 --> 01:49:23,380
we'll play it again for those of you guys that missed it is your mic on and I

1369
01:49:23,380 --> 01:49:28,180
also reminded people on DDR freak that you know because I told them what it was

1370
01:49:28,180 --> 01:49:33,260
was, and I reminded them that they can listen to it also on our rewinds that are on Friday

1371
01:49:33,260 --> 01:49:35,060
on DDR Freak Radio.

1372
01:49:35,060 --> 01:49:36,060
Very nice.

1373
01:49:36,060 --> 01:49:37,060
Good plug.

1374
01:49:37,060 --> 01:49:43,340
Actually, the rewind for this week won't show up till next Friday, because there was a boo-boo

1375
01:49:43,340 --> 01:49:50,320
and one of our shows got delayed, so we're a week behind again over there, so yeah, if

1376
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:51,320
that makes any sense.

1377
01:49:51,320 --> 01:49:56,040
Well, actually, this show will be on there next Friday, so whatever.

1378
01:49:56,040 --> 01:49:57,040
But look for it.

1379
01:49:57,040 --> 01:50:01,280
should, you know, always listen to the rewinds so you can relive your favorite OLR moments.

1380
01:50:01,280 --> 01:50:04,160
That's right, they'll hear us talking about gothic stuff and they'll think that we were

1381
01:50:04,160 --> 01:50:06,720
hinting at the song the whole time.

1382
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:08,000
I swear we weren't.

1383
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,160
We really weren't.

1384
01:50:09,160 --> 01:50:11,560
I don't know how long...

1385
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:15,280
Spray doesn't have dates as to when they do updates on their site, so we don't know when

1386
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:19,240
they put that up there, but it probably wasn't that long ago.

1387
01:50:19,240 --> 01:50:21,040
I figured out the connection too.

1388
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:22,040
Oh!

1389
01:50:22,040 --> 01:50:23,040
What is the connection?

1390
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:32,040
the record label, which is quite small, called 9th Day or something, 9th Something Records.

1391
01:50:32,040 --> 01:50:41,040
Anyways, they're a teeny, teeny, tiny label, and they only have a few artists, which all have really horrible web pages, except for Spray.

1392
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:48,040
And they're actually sold by none other than a Denver Drum.

1393
01:50:48,040 --> 01:50:51,040
Oh, so I think you found the connection there then. Interesting.

1394
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:55,040
which means it's probably not a licensed song

1395
01:50:55,040 --> 01:50:59,040
since if we ask miklotov he'll just say NDA which could mean yes

1396
01:50:59,040 --> 01:51:03,040
he's grabbing for a microphone

1397
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:07,040
oh you look like you're grabbing for a microphone

1398
01:51:07,040 --> 01:51:11,040
why are you even here?

1399
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:15,040
wait miklotov he wants a mic

1400
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:19,040
I'm here because I wanted to get drunk last night and I succeeded

1401
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:23,040
He drunk himself black.

1402
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:27,040
Alright. DarkSacker, are you going to say something?

1403
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:31,040
I think that someone needs to make a mention

1404
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:35,040
of the times for the rewind.

1405
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:39,040
I would love to, but I think it's six o'clock, I think?

1406
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:43,040
I don't know very well. You know what, though? I will check DDR Freak's schedule

1407
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:47,040
just for you guys right now, and have a look-see. In the meantime,

1408
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:50,040
DarkSacker, if you want to plug some other shows that we have on Orange Lounge Radio?

1409
01:51:50,040 --> 01:51:54,040
Yeah, I'd like to plug one. Where's my gun? No, I mean...

1410
01:51:54,040 --> 01:52:00,040
I do public the volume on Tuesdays with a music request show, except no one requests anything,

1411
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:07,040
except randomly going, we want to hear this song! And I don't have it, so I tell you to send it to me.

1412
01:52:07,040 --> 01:52:09,040
Oh yeah, back to the show.

1413
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:13,040
Pre-show starts at a quarter to seven. Official time is seven.

1414
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:19,200
The show starts at 7.30, I go to 10.30 supposedly, except I've been kind of going overboard since

1415
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:23,200
I've been working a later shift at work the next day, so you never know I might go to

1416
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:25,320
3 AM.

1417
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:26,700
Very nice.

1418
01:52:26,700 --> 01:52:29,080
And I play a lot of good music.

1419
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:32,360
It isn't necessarily video game.

1420
01:52:32,360 --> 01:52:36,300
There are, and I know I keep saying this, but there are some new shows coming to Orange

1421
01:52:36,300 --> 01:52:38,900
Lawn very soon.

1422
01:52:38,900 --> 01:52:41,000
I will be coming back with a new show.

1423
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:42,240
Skye's voiced the game.

1424
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:46,240
I will be coming back with a new show very soon.

1425
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:50,240
I'm looking forward to it. It's going to be a little different from outside the box, but

1426
01:52:50,240 --> 01:52:54,240
I think it'll be cool. You guys will dig it. I also know that there's

1427
01:52:54,240 --> 01:52:58,240
another project that doesn't involve any of us. I know it's

1428
01:52:58,240 --> 01:53:02,240
being worked on, and we're waiting to see what it sounds like

1429
01:53:02,240 --> 01:53:06,240
to see if it's airable, but it should be interesting.

1430
01:53:06,240 --> 01:53:10,240
I think we should play it even if it's not airable. Either way, it should be interesting.

1431
01:53:10,240 --> 01:53:13,680
There's also another show that I brought up.

1432
01:53:13,680 --> 01:53:14,680
Yeah, you've mentioned this before.

1433
01:53:14,680 --> 01:53:15,680
Um, it's...

1434
01:53:15,680 --> 01:53:16,680
I'm moving...

1435
01:53:16,680 --> 01:53:17,680
Okay, first of all, background.

1436
01:53:17,680 --> 01:53:19,960
I'm moving to a new house, so it won't be there for a couple weeks.

1437
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:24,220
Um, but there will be a show hosted by Dan.

1438
01:53:24,220 --> 01:53:26,280
As in, my Dan.

1439
01:53:26,280 --> 01:53:28,860
And his crazy GameStop buddies.

1440
01:53:28,860 --> 01:53:30,240
That should be very interesting.

1441
01:53:30,240 --> 01:53:31,240
GameStop talk!

1442
01:53:31,240 --> 01:53:32,240
It's going to...

1443
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:33,240
We're in the only gaming store!

1444
01:53:33,240 --> 01:53:35,880
It's going to basically be a...

1445
01:53:35,880 --> 01:53:40,640
When the new stuff comes out, his show goes up, he can get it that day and play it for

1446
01:53:40,640 --> 01:53:41,960
you even early.

1447
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:43,920
So that'll be very, that's going to be very cool.

1448
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:45,580
So something to look forward to.

1449
01:53:45,580 --> 01:53:49,520
So we are branching out because I know my new show's going to be General Gaming as well.

1450
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:50,880
That's going to be very exciting, his show.

1451
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:53,720
We've also talked about other things, but yeah.

1452
01:53:53,720 --> 01:53:59,400
There is definitely coming something to the station as soon as next week that's very exciting.

1453
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:03,120
It's not a live talk show, it's something else, but it's very exciting nonetheless.

1454
01:54:03,120 --> 01:54:04,400
So I think so anyway.

1455
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:05,400
It'll be fun.

1456
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:10,440
show, if nothing else. I'm doing a special show later on, too, that's going to be fun

1457
01:54:10,440 --> 01:54:15,640
and have nothing to do with our normal shows, but it just fits because it's nerdy and geeky.

1458
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:21,040
It's old school nerdy. I mean, like, old, old school. So, it should be a lot of fun

1459
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:25,280
and a little retro there. So, actually, for those of you that like old school, you are

1460
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:28,640
going to love the announcement we have this week. Hopefully, this week it's done. You

1461
01:54:28,640 --> 01:54:32,640
are going to love this announcement. Oh, yeah. You will poo your pants. Maybe not, but maybe.

1462
01:54:32,640 --> 01:54:33,640
That's good.

1463
01:54:33,640 --> 01:54:34,640
Quite awesome.

1464
01:54:34,640 --> 01:54:35,640
It's great.

1465
01:54:35,640 --> 01:54:36,640
Alright.

1466
01:54:36,640 --> 01:54:37,640
Anyway.

1467
01:54:37,640 --> 01:54:38,640
So enough talking.

1468
01:54:38,640 --> 01:54:39,640
Oh, I was going to mention too.

1469
01:54:39,640 --> 01:54:40,640
Our website is awesome.

1470
01:54:40,640 --> 01:54:41,640
You should go check it out.

1471
01:54:41,640 --> 01:54:45,880
In fact, we've got a story now about Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories with pictures.

1472
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:48,000
Yeah, that's my pictures.

1473
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:52,240
Rockstar is ripping them off other people's sites, but not us because we rock.

1474
01:54:52,240 --> 01:54:53,860
So we have pictures for you.

1475
01:54:53,860 --> 01:54:54,860
Go check them out.

1476
01:54:54,860 --> 01:54:55,860
It's pretty.

1477
01:54:55,860 --> 01:54:59,320
We also have the final pictures from 583.

1478
01:54:59,320 --> 01:55:00,320
E3.

1479
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:02,640
They're all up too.

1480
01:55:02,640 --> 01:55:03,920
Am I in any of them?

1481
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:06,080
No, but a slime is.

1482
01:55:06,080 --> 01:55:09,800
Yes, I finally got off of my ass and put up all the galleries.

1483
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:13,560
How many pictures total from E3 did you have?

1484
01:55:13,560 --> 01:55:16,640
About 700 something.

1485
01:55:16,640 --> 01:55:21,760
Let me take a look, I'll add them up.

1486
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:22,760
Talk about something.

1487
01:55:22,760 --> 01:55:26,280
You can talk about how awesome I am?

1488
01:55:26,280 --> 01:55:27,280
You are awesome.

1489
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:30,280
I am such a whore for the camera.

1490
01:55:30,280 --> 01:55:31,280
Mostly awesome.

1491
01:55:31,280 --> 01:55:32,280
Just kidding.

1492
01:55:32,280 --> 01:55:35,400
I thought your story earlier was really funny about, because you came in here and you said,

1493
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:39,240
I was Noah and I had to collect two of everything and clean up the flood.

1494
01:55:39,240 --> 01:55:42,600
You were actually being serious because my roommate spilled a gallon of water on the

1495
01:55:42,600 --> 01:55:46,880
floor in the kitchen, so she really was gone during the whole spray thing.

1496
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:47,880
It's a problem.

1497
01:55:47,880 --> 01:55:48,880
Yeah, I was getting sprayed.

1498
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:49,880
Thank you.

1499
01:55:49,880 --> 01:55:53,680
Yeah, my roommate sprayed water all over the floor, so it works.

1500
01:55:53,680 --> 01:55:57,320
These are the kind of hints you're supposed to do before the songs are announced, people.

1501
01:55:57,320 --> 01:55:58,320
That's alright.

1502
01:55:58,320 --> 01:55:59,320
Alright.

1503
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:00,320
Okay.

1504
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:05,280
Okay, Friday has 104.

1505
01:56:05,280 --> 01:56:06,280
And Thursday...

1506
01:56:06,280 --> 01:56:08,800
Which, by the way, like 20 of them are the PS3.

1507
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:13,720
So you can check out the PlayStation 3 from, like, every conceivable angle, because Dark

1508
01:56:13,720 --> 01:56:14,720
Sakura got it all.

1509
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:19,200
I put five pictures of the, five of the best pictures on the story that I did, which I'll

1510
01:56:19,200 --> 01:56:20,680
go back and link in the chat room.

1511
01:56:20,680 --> 01:56:25,480
Just an overview though, all the PS3 stuff is on Fridays.

1512
01:56:25,480 --> 01:56:31,800
Gunstar Superheroes, Magic Online, Kingdom Hearts, that's on Thursday, I have 263 images,

1513
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:32,800
various stuff.

1514
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:41,960
I also got the new Dead to Rights for PSP on the Thursday one, and, oh crap, I just

1515
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:42,960
lost the page.

1516
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:43,960
Oh, there we go.

1517
01:56:43,960 --> 01:56:47,160
Yeah, this is brilliant radio here.

1518
01:56:47,160 --> 01:56:48,160
And then for...

1519
01:56:48,160 --> 01:56:50,560
Rob, where are your pictures?

1520
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:56,560
They're not up yet. I was just about to say, my pictures are still not up yet. I didn't take quite nearly as many as Jamie. I think I have maybe about 100 total.

1521
01:56:56,560 --> 01:57:00,560
273 for Wednesday.

1522
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:05,560
Including pictures of army parachuting.

1523
01:57:05,560 --> 01:57:10,560
But what I do have in my picture gallery that I will be putting up soon is I have pictures of booth babes.

1524
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:15,560
Because nothing says love into those booth babes like a gay man running around E3 with a camera.

1525
01:57:15,560 --> 01:57:17,560
So you can look forward to that.

1526
01:57:17,560 --> 01:57:18,560
I have something that tops that.

1527
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:19,560
What's that?

1528
01:57:19,560 --> 01:57:22,560
I have a sexy picture of Shane.

1529
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:23,560
Do you?

1530
01:57:23,560 --> 01:57:24,560
Yes, I do.

1531
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:25,560
A sexy picture of Shane?

1532
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:26,560
Right here.

1533
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:29,560
If you ever wanted to know what Miklotov looked like, you can go to the gallery right now and see.

1534
01:57:29,560 --> 01:57:31,560
There's actually a full page of PlayStation 3.

1535
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:33,560
That's pretty funny.

1536
01:57:33,560 --> 01:57:35,560
Oh, wow, there really is.

1537
01:57:35,560 --> 01:57:36,560
It's kind of blurry.

1538
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:37,560
All right, anyway.

1539
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:38,560
You're doing the thumbs up.

1540
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:39,560
Oh, awesome.

1541
01:57:39,560 --> 01:57:40,560
Okay, I'll have a couple.

1542
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:41,560
All right.

1543
01:57:41,560 --> 01:57:50,560
Rob also has another picture. It's a sexy picture of me hugging Mario.

1544
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:57,560
I have a story from E3, actually. How Dan scared the living shit out of Miyamoto.

1545
01:57:57,560 --> 01:57:58,560
How's that?

1546
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:03,560
He got up with this thing to be autographed, and just as Miyamoto was getting up to leave,

1547
01:58:03,560 --> 01:58:08,560
he puts his hand on his shoulder, and he gives him this look of utter horror.

1548
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:12,560
And then Dan goes, thumbs up with a big ol' grin, and then he started laughing.

1549
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:14,560
So yeah, he saw him dancing.

1550
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:16,560
Wow. Anyways.

1551
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:18,560
Okay. Yeah. New subject, yes?

1552
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:20,560
Alright, we're moving on. Let's go.

1553
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:22,560
New subject. How about the cage match, boys and girls?

1554
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:23,560
How about?

1555
01:58:23,560 --> 01:58:24,560
Alright.

1556
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:25,560
Woohoo!

1557
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:31,560
Tonight's cage match, the way it works, three songs put into battle.

1558
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:35,560
You guys in the chatroom get to vote for your favorite song,

1559
01:58:35,560 --> 01:58:39,460
And the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's

1560
01:58:39,460 --> 01:58:43,740
Bomani Music and Video Game program, which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week

1561
01:58:43,740 --> 01:58:46,020
on this stream when we are not here.

1562
01:58:46,020 --> 01:58:46,900
All right.

1563
01:58:46,900 --> 01:58:51,580
The song that is the current victor is a song that has been in the victory

1564
01:58:51,580 --> 01:58:53,140
circle for two weeks now.

1565
01:58:53,140 --> 01:58:54,780
It's halfway to retirement.

1566
01:58:54,780 --> 01:58:57,660
We haven't had a retired song in quite a while, so this might be, I'm sure Jamie

1567
01:58:57,660 --> 01:59:02,420
would be thrilled, being the fangirl that she is, to get this song retired.

1568
01:59:02,420 --> 01:59:08,540
it has to happen with your guys's help and you know Loki and I are gonna do our

1569
01:59:08,540 --> 01:59:15,220
best to take it out so yeah yeah we'll see all right I don't know tonight I

1570
01:59:15,220 --> 01:59:18,700
know what I picked and I know that your very last minute I don't think we're

1571
01:59:18,700 --> 01:59:21,700
gonna be giving this song much competition tonight but you never know

1572
01:59:21,700 --> 01:59:25,860
all right so here it is song number one a clip of last week's winner you only

1573
01:59:25,860 --> 01:59:29,780
get to hear clip because you've heard this song already it's the gorillas and

1574
01:59:29,780 --> 01:59:32,860
And the song is their next single from the album, Demon Days.

1575
01:59:32,860 --> 01:59:33,980
It's Dare.

1576
01:59:33,980 --> 01:59:43,980
Hold me now there, jump in the moment when you see it

1577
01:59:43,980 --> 01:59:49,980
Jump back and forth, I feel like you were there

1578
01:59:49,980 --> 01:59:53,980
Let's get out

1579
02:00:23,980 --> 02:00:43,980
You've got the pressure on you, you just listen That's what you do, baby, hold it down, yeah

1580
02:00:43,980 --> 02:00:58,980
Jump back and forth, I feel like you were laying yourself, working out

1581
02:00:58,980 --> 02:01:06,980
Never did no harm, never did no harm

1582
02:01:36,980 --> 02:02:03,500
All righty, that was song number one, two weeks, going for a third win tonight, Gorillaz

1583
02:02:03,500 --> 02:02:04,500
with Dare.

1584
02:02:04,500 --> 02:02:10,500
Alright, we don't get to rate that song. We're going right into the next one because it already won, so you already know it's good.

1585
02:02:10,500 --> 02:02:21,500
Alright, the next song is my pick and I'm being really adventurous with my pick tonight because I really think that you guys are going to kind of be really weird with this one.

1586
02:02:21,500 --> 02:02:25,620
But um, you know, I don't I don't know what to say like

1587
02:02:26,260 --> 02:02:31,080
This artist is somebody I would never consider putting putting in the cage match

1588
02:02:31,300 --> 02:02:39,300
but the production values on this song are surprisingly really good and to take a person like this and

1589
02:02:40,260 --> 02:02:42,260
to produce a song

1590
02:02:42,620 --> 02:02:43,980
that is

1591
02:02:43,980 --> 02:02:46,900
Kind of infectious in a way. It's kind of impressive to me

1592
02:02:46,900 --> 02:02:50,200
So therefore I'm giving it a cage match spin to see what you guys think of it

1593
02:02:50,200 --> 02:02:55,080
And it was co-written by the chick from poor non blondes, which I think is cool. So cuz she's cool

1594
02:02:55,080 --> 02:02:57,440
All right. So here it is the artist

1595
02:02:57,960 --> 02:03:03,060
Brace yourself now don't hate this song just after I say the artist. The artist is Kelly Osbourne and

1596
02:03:03,580 --> 02:03:07,740
This song is one word. Okay, so give it a chance

1597
02:03:07,740 --> 02:03:13,540
Don't hate it just yet because it's kind of dancey check it out Kelly Osbourne one word here on the cage match

1598
02:03:19,260 --> 02:03:22,500
See even my computer doesn't want to play it here. Let's try this again kids

1599
02:03:22,500 --> 02:03:26,500
This is Kelly Osborn with one word here in the cage match.

1600
02:03:52,500 --> 02:03:59,500
One word breaks the code of silence Silence tells me all I need

1601
02:03:59,500 --> 02:04:16,500
One word breaks the code of silence Silence tells me all I need

1602
02:04:16,500 --> 02:04:20,500
One word breaks the code of silence

1603
02:04:20,500 --> 02:04:24,500
Silence tells me all I need to know

1604
02:04:24,500 --> 02:04:28,500
One word, one word

1605
02:04:28,500 --> 02:04:32,500
Tells me everything I need to know

1606
02:04:32,500 --> 02:04:36,500
One world driven into madness

1607
02:04:36,500 --> 02:04:40,500
Madness driven by the depths below

1608
02:04:40,500 --> 02:04:44,500
One word, one word

1609
02:04:45,060 --> 02:04:48,980
Tells me everything I need to know

1610
02:04:48,980 --> 02:04:51,680
It's not the way that I want it

1611
02:04:51,680 --> 02:04:55,020
It's just the way that I need it today

1612
02:04:58,020 --> 02:04:59,760
It's not the way that I want it

1613
02:04:59,880 --> 02:05:02,440
It's just the way that I need it today

1614
02:05:06,360 --> 02:05:10,000
Wasn't mine, cause a thousand stories

1615
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:14,000
The greatest stories ever told

1616
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:18,000
One lie, one lie

1617
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:22,000
Tells the greatest stories ever told

1618
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:26,000
One man can't predict the future

1619
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:30,000
A future journey into outer space

1620
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:34,000
One man, one man

1621
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:38,000
A future journey into outer space

1622
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:56,320
It's not the way that I want it It's just the way that I need it

1623
02:06:26,320 --> 02:06:30,320
After that, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

1624
02:06:56,320 --> 02:07:02,320
It's just the way that I need it today

1625
02:07:02,320 --> 02:07:04,320
It's not the way that I want it

1626
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:31,800
All right, that was song number two in tonight's cage match, Kelly Osbourne.

1627
02:07:31,800 --> 02:07:33,400
One word.

1628
02:07:33,400 --> 02:07:39,120
And now we get one vote from each person, actually not a vote, but one judgement, one

1629
02:07:39,120 --> 02:07:41,320
judgement from each person here in the room.

1630
02:07:41,320 --> 02:07:42,320
Dark Sockra.

1631
02:07:42,320 --> 02:07:52,160
Um, well I heard this in your car last week, and I liked it, it's okay, it is though really

1632
02:07:52,160 --> 02:07:58,680
repetitive, and she doesn't really sound like herself through all the synths and everything,

1633
02:07:58,680 --> 02:08:00,800
which I guess might be a blessing in disguise.

1634
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:01,800
I think so.

1635
02:08:01,800 --> 02:08:05,680
Um, it would be a background song for me, honestly.

1636
02:08:05,680 --> 02:08:09,280
I'd give it a seven.

1637
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:11,640
I'm being really nice, I'd give it a seven.

1638
02:08:11,640 --> 02:08:14,280
Me personally, I think it's great.

1639
02:08:14,280 --> 02:08:18,440
Kelly Osbourne, okay, the rock thing really didn't work for her, so she can't sing so

1640
02:08:18,440 --> 02:08:23,360
well, so let's find a genre that fits perfectly for people who can't sing that well.

1641
02:08:23,360 --> 02:08:26,520
Let's revive 80s New Wave, it works great.

1642
02:08:26,520 --> 02:08:29,120
So I like it, so I give it an eight for 80s.

1643
02:08:29,120 --> 02:08:34,120
Loki, she needs to get her dad to fucking sing with her, because at least that would be cool.

1644
02:08:35,120 --> 02:08:36,120
Honestly.

1645
02:08:36,120 --> 02:08:40,120
I have a music file of Ozzy Osbourne doing Stayin' Alive.

1646
02:08:40,120 --> 02:08:42,120
Oh my god, that was fucking awesome, I heard that.

1647
02:08:42,120 --> 02:08:43,120
That was great.

1648
02:08:43,120 --> 02:08:44,120
That was great.

1649
02:08:44,120 --> 02:08:45,120
I gotta bring that in.

1650
02:08:45,120 --> 02:08:47,120
All aboard the disco chain!

1651
02:08:47,120 --> 02:08:48,120
Hello.

1652
02:08:48,120 --> 02:08:49,120
I'm bringing that in.

1653
02:08:49,120 --> 02:08:50,120
One word, one word.

1654
02:08:50,120 --> 02:08:51,120
Oh, one word?

1655
02:08:51,120 --> 02:08:52,120
One song.

1656
02:08:52,120 --> 02:08:53,120
It was okay.

1657
02:08:53,120 --> 02:08:57,120
It was just kind of, it was very boring.

1658
02:08:57,120 --> 02:09:05,120
and I don't like Kelly Osbourne at all, and um, it was just kind of eh, it was just, I don't know,

1659
02:09:05,120 --> 02:09:08,880
she could keep doing that same genre because it's not as bad as like say, I don't know, um,

1660
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:14,320
Lala or something like that, you know, I know that's not Kelly Osbourne, but just as bad,

1661
02:09:14,320 --> 02:09:21,520
and trying to be rock. That one? Yeah, oh yeah, okay. This 80s, this, not 80s, this pop rock

1662
02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:26,720
crap that they're doing now, not good, okay, just crap, but it's good to see you're going

1663
02:09:26,720 --> 02:09:31,280
in a new direction, so I guess they give it a second. Alright. Miguel Ataz, something

1664
02:09:31,280 --> 02:09:36,720
you can talk about tonight for once. Kelly Osborn, one word. It was okay, um, kinda boring.

1665
02:09:36,720 --> 02:09:43,720
I think that's the theme. Uh, six. Alrighty. Let's get into song number three. It's Loki's

1666
02:09:43,720 --> 02:09:47,440
song and he refuses to tell me the name, so he will be doing the introduction. I will

1667
02:09:47,440 --> 02:09:54,160
be doing the introduction. Now this song, it's a remix I actually finished today, um,

1668
02:09:54,160 --> 02:10:02,160
I've been, you know, doing remixes now that I've got, you know, a Myspace, you know, community thing going here, so, um...

1669
02:10:02,160 --> 02:10:10,160
I did two remixes today, one of them being a remix to Dropout, which we're not playing, and the other remix is to Skulk!

1670
02:10:10,160 --> 02:10:14,160
This is Echo Image Skulk with, um...

1671
02:10:14,160 --> 02:10:19,160
Oh god, what the hell was the name of this? It was...

1672
02:10:19,160 --> 02:10:21,560
Nobody Understands Mix, that's what it was.

1673
02:10:21,560 --> 02:10:24,260
Okay, so this is Skulk, the Nobody Understands Mix.

1674
02:10:24,260 --> 02:10:24,760
Exactly.

1675
02:10:24,760 --> 02:10:25,860
Interesting, alright.

1676
02:10:25,860 --> 02:10:28,660
Any, uh, you want to talk about what you mixed it with, or later?

1677
02:10:28,660 --> 02:10:34,460
It's just, it's a lot of different versions of Skulk kind of put together, and also some other songs and stuff.

1678
02:10:35,260 --> 02:10:38,860
There's some things I would have loved to do to it that I couldn't do,

1679
02:10:38,860 --> 02:10:42,260
and so, you know, I see all the flaws in it, you know, going into it, but it's-

1680
02:10:42,260 --> 02:10:43,260
Way to sell it.

1681
02:10:43,260 --> 02:10:47,060
Hey, I'm sorry, okay, because I don't want to just, you know,

1682
02:10:47,060 --> 02:10:50,640
pop-out mixes that are just something you're going to see on BomaniStyle, you know, like

1683
02:10:50,640 --> 02:10:55,100
some of the crap that's on there. So I'm really picky on the stuff that I want to release

1684
02:10:55,100 --> 02:10:58,080
out there on the internet. That's why the dropout thing's not ever getting released

1685
02:10:58,080 --> 02:11:03,880
on the internet. But we'll hear that later. Anyways, this is Echo Image, Skulk, the No

1686
02:11:03,880 --> 02:11:05,880
No one here to stand, mix.

1687
02:12:03,880 --> 02:12:31,880
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1688
02:12:31,880 --> 02:12:35,380
It's like the fragment of my soul

1689
02:12:35,380 --> 02:12:39,880
It's the end, that's where I've become

1690
02:12:39,880 --> 02:12:43,380
I'm falling like I always have

1691
02:12:43,380 --> 02:12:46,380
Make me take control

1692
02:12:46,380 --> 02:12:49,380
I'll be no different than she

1693
02:12:49,380 --> 02:12:53,880
Making me feel like I'm back now

1694
02:14:53,880 --> 02:15:23,860
All right, Loki there, remixing Echo Image with Skulk, the nobody-understood

1695
02:15:23,860 --> 02:15:30,860
Let's see if the judges, us, were able to understand it, or we just didn't get it.

1696
02:15:30,860 --> 02:15:31,860
Dark Sakura.

1697
02:15:31,860 --> 02:15:35,860
It was overall good.

1698
02:15:35,860 --> 02:15:41,860
I think that the music over Shadow, it was imbalanced versus the lyrics.

1699
02:15:41,860 --> 02:15:43,860
It was actually pretty imbalanced.

1700
02:15:43,860 --> 02:15:49,860
I thought that the beat itself on the first measure could have,

1701
02:15:49,860 --> 02:15:53,340
could have at the beginning of every measure could have been a little bit

1702
02:15:53,340 --> 02:15:58,060
more subdued because I started getting headache which is how I do it whenever

1703
02:15:58,060 --> 02:16:04,940
any song does like that is so it doesn't matter what song it is it was so solid

1704
02:16:04,940 --> 02:16:10,580
with a little tweaking it could be a 10 so I go right now I give it a 7 and a half

1705
02:16:10,580 --> 02:16:15,900
bogey exact same thoughts because they have the same problems trying to pull

1706
02:16:15,900 --> 02:16:20,700
just you know vocals out of there can't really do that if i don't have a vocal track but i work with

1707
02:16:20,700 --> 02:16:27,340
what i got so you know i give it a nine um i you know i would think that loki and echo image

1708
02:16:27,340 --> 02:16:32,780
colliding would be like an instant 10 but for me like some of it was just like too busy like the

1709
02:16:32,780 --> 02:16:35,980
middle part of it was like too much like i think i felt the jamie thing was like oh my god there's

1710
02:16:35,980 --> 02:16:41,820
like too much here um but i think for what he had to work with loki did an amazing job i think what

1711
02:16:41,820 --> 02:16:47,020
it is is it's the beginning of a really really good mix and if Loki could get

1712
02:16:47,020 --> 02:16:51,260
the original samples and stuff he could clean it up a lot and it would totally

1713
02:16:51,260 --> 02:16:54,940
like just blow us all away it's hard because when you're working with like

1714
02:16:54,940 --> 02:16:58,500
three or four different tracks that once mixed in together on top and only one

1715
02:16:58,500 --> 02:17:02,600
has a vocal track pulling the vocals out there is impossible and I've tried the

1716
02:17:02,600 --> 02:17:06,340
best I could to like subdue the other tracks while I have a vocal track going

1717
02:17:06,340 --> 02:17:10,700
but it's like extremely extremely hard to do and that was like the best I can

1718
02:17:10,700 --> 02:17:15,260
it after a couple hours today. I do have a piece of advice in general though. You know

1719
02:17:15,260 --> 02:17:20,480
those drum beats that get louder as they go? You use those quite a lot. Yes, I recognize

1720
02:17:20,480 --> 02:17:26,620
that too in this song. You use that in every single mix! It's just temporary stuff. Alright.

1721
02:17:26,620 --> 02:17:31,300
You know what though? It's a start to something absolutely brilliant. I think that a simple

1722
02:17:31,300 --> 02:17:36,300
crescendo would be good. These people should be contacting you to remix their stuff. 7.5.

1723
02:17:36,300 --> 02:17:46,140
It reminded me a lot of the extended mix that is on Amazon.com that when people first heard

1724
02:17:46,140 --> 02:17:50,300
about Skuld they were downloading and thinking it was going to be in the game.

1725
02:17:50,300 --> 02:17:56,300
Not overly fond of that one, but it was still decent nonetheless, 7.

1726
02:17:56,300 --> 02:18:00,860
Alright let's recap kids, it's not up to us, it's up to you, here are the three songs you

1727
02:18:00,860 --> 02:18:05,520
get to vote for tonight in tonight's cage match.

1728
02:18:05,520 --> 02:18:18,580
Song number one you can vote for tonight is Dare.

1729
02:18:18,580 --> 02:18:35,400
And song number two you can vote for tonight is Kelly Osbourne with One Word.

1730
02:18:35,400 --> 02:18:40,480
Alright, and song number three you can vote for tonight is Echo Image, uh, remixed by

1731
02:18:40,480 --> 02:18:43,480
Loki, Skulk, the Nobody Understands mix.

1732
02:18:55,480 --> 02:19:02,480
Alright, place votes now! Send a private message to Skye in the chat room with your vote for

1733
02:19:02,480 --> 02:19:07,060
song number one, song number two, or song number three. Or you can call them by the

1734
02:19:07,060 --> 02:19:10,820
artist or name. I'm not retarded. I'll be able to figure it out either way.

1735
02:19:10,820 --> 02:19:13,120
We should play my other song since it's on the CD.

1736
02:19:13,120 --> 02:19:17,440
We will get to that. However, I want to give you a chance to talk about what's going on

1737
02:19:17,440 --> 02:19:18,440
in these systems.

1738
02:19:18,440 --> 02:19:24,000
In this scene. Nothing. And sadly enough, you know, I wish I had something to talk about,

1739
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:27,280
but there is nothing. So instead, I'm going to talk about something else, and that's diverse

1740
02:19:27,280 --> 02:19:32,200
systems, D9s coming out. I still haven't figured out a way to actually be able to order the

1741
02:19:32,200 --> 02:19:36,340
rest of them, since their English page only goes up to D6, which I have everything from

1742
02:19:36,340 --> 02:19:44,600
that back. So, I'm gonna maybe try, because I hate experimenting with sending them money,

1743
02:19:44,600 --> 02:19:49,380
especially since there's that language barrier there. I'm gonna try to order something that's

1744
02:19:49,380 --> 02:19:56,060
not on their order page, that's on the Japanese order page, and see if they said it anyways.

1745
02:19:56,060 --> 02:19:59,440
And hopefully they do. If that's the case, because there's a lot of CDs I gotta catch

1746
02:19:59,440 --> 02:20:04,440
up on the whole D7, D8, and then since D9 was announced, and then there's, you know,

1747
02:20:04,440 --> 02:20:14,440
Hello, was it, Hello Mr., was it Desire, and Hello Mr. Taka, I think, or something like

1748
02:20:14,440 --> 02:20:19,440
that. So, those we still need to get, but they've announced the stuff for D9 already,

1749
02:20:19,440 --> 02:20:25,440
and there's a lot of remixes from 9th and 10th style in it so far, so it should be interesting.

1750
02:20:25,440 --> 02:20:27,840
Alright, so that's pretty much it for The Sim Scene?

1751
02:20:27,840 --> 02:20:34,840
Yeah, there's nothing going on. I checked all the FoodMix stuff. No new releases or anything yet.

1752
02:20:34,840 --> 02:20:39,840
Probably you'll see the actual FoodMix release in about a month or so from now.

1753
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:44,840
It'll be coming. It's coming soon. But stuff like that is worth the wait.

1754
02:20:47,840 --> 02:20:53,840
Too bad none of our listeners were listening to Diversion. Or else we could keep playing this stuff.

1755
02:20:53,840 --> 02:20:58,120
You know, I will still also give it credit here on orange launch radio live, so we'll do it

1756
02:20:58,720 --> 02:21:04,400
Anyway, what we're going to do. We are going to play the other Loki remix while you guys send in your votes right now for cage

1757
02:21:04,400 --> 02:21:05,560
match and

1758
02:21:05,560 --> 02:21:12,040
Then when we come back Dark Sakura has something completely different for you guys in a in a new segment

1759
02:21:12,040 --> 02:21:14,840
I don't know what we can call this segment, but Dark Sakura is gonna the

1760
02:21:15,360 --> 02:21:21,720
WTF news the WTF report brought to you by Dark Sakura, so she'll be giving you that when we come back from this

1761
02:21:21,720 --> 02:21:24,720
Loki, you want to give this one an introduction?

1762
02:21:24,720 --> 02:21:33,720
Yeah, this is a B-side, basically. It's a remix that I did. I finished it just because it didn't turn out as good as I thought it was going to be.

1763
02:21:33,720 --> 02:21:38,720
So, this is a B-side remix of Dropout. I don't really have a title for it. It's just kind of interesting.

1764
02:21:38,720 --> 02:21:44,720
The problem with it is, for one, I couldn't do much with Dropout and the song.

1765
02:21:44,720 --> 02:21:51,700
And when I slowed the first song down to be about dropout speed, it didn't sound right.

1766
02:21:51,700 --> 02:21:57,500
So you can listen to it, it's okay, but it's never going to be on the internet to download.

1767
02:21:57,500 --> 02:22:00,420
So this is the dropout B-side mix, I guess.

1768
02:22:00,420 --> 02:22:01,420
I guess.

1769
02:22:01,420 --> 02:22:05,840
Because it's about, it's like, you know, like how we did, what was it, Acid, that one time.

1770
02:22:05,840 --> 02:22:07,620
It was an okay remix.

1771
02:22:07,620 --> 02:22:11,140
It's not anything I'd be proud of or like be out there, you know, saying, hey, look

1772
02:22:11,140 --> 02:22:12,140
at what I did.

1773
02:22:12,140 --> 02:22:16,980
This is just like, kind of, okay, I did it, you know, I started it, I finished it just

1774
02:22:16,980 --> 02:22:18,900
to get it done, so then, you know, moving on.

1775
02:22:18,900 --> 02:22:20,180
Is this on the MySpace?

1776
02:22:20,180 --> 02:22:21,180
No.

1777
02:22:21,180 --> 02:22:22,180
Okay.

1778
02:22:22,180 --> 02:22:24,420
Plug your MySpace, though, for folks that are into this, if they like your Echo Image

1779
02:22:24,420 --> 02:22:25,420
Mix and they like this.

1780
02:22:25,420 --> 02:22:31,180
If they like the Echo Image Mix, when it's done, finally, it will be on my MySpace page,

1781
02:22:31,180 --> 02:22:37,220
which is MySpace.com slash Loki Fusion, all one word, and you can check it out, you can

1782
02:22:37,220 --> 02:22:38,220
rate MySpace.

1783
02:22:38,220 --> 02:22:39,220
How many friends do you have now?

1784
02:22:39,220 --> 02:22:40,380
I have about 17 friends.

1785
02:22:40,380 --> 02:22:41,380
Woohoo!

1786
02:22:41,380 --> 02:22:47,100
people that I've, they're just random people. Good. So that's kind of neat. But yeah, Myspace.com

1787
02:22:47,100 --> 02:22:52,340
slash LowkeyFusion. You can check it out. I made a little cool banner for it and then,

1788
02:22:52,340 --> 02:22:56,120
and my page doesn't look too bad. So it's pretty nice. Check it out. Right now we've

1789
02:22:56,120 --> 02:23:03,720
got the Ecstasy remix because it's one, that's my favorite. We've got the Battle Without

1790
02:23:03,720 --> 02:23:10,880
Honor or Humanity, the 88 Severed Limbs mix which is on there. We also have, which some

1791
02:23:10,880 --> 02:23:16,640
Some people were saying they couldn't find before, the Radical Faith Final Judgment mix,

1792
02:23:16,640 --> 02:23:18,160
I think is what I called it.

1793
02:23:18,160 --> 02:23:19,160
And that's on there as well.

1794
02:23:19,160 --> 02:23:20,160
Alright, so check it out.

1795
02:23:20,160 --> 02:23:21,160
Here it is.

1796
02:23:21,160 --> 02:23:23,760
The premiere of Dropout, probably the only time you'll hear this.

1797
02:23:23,760 --> 02:23:25,240
Yeah, this is the B-side of it.

1798
02:23:25,240 --> 02:23:26,960
Dropout, the B-side mix, by Loki.

1799
02:23:26,960 --> 02:23:27,960
Enjoy.

1800
02:23:27,960 --> 02:23:29,960
Bring it back!

1801
02:23:29,960 --> 02:23:31,960
I'm a thief!

1802
02:23:31,960 --> 02:23:33,960
I'm telling the truth!

1803
02:23:33,960 --> 02:23:35,960
I'm a thief!

1804
02:23:35,960 --> 02:23:37,960
I'm a thief!

1805
02:23:37,960 --> 02:23:39,960
We have controlled the factory.

1806
02:23:39,960 --> 02:23:41,960
We have controlled the factory.

1807
02:23:41,960 --> 02:23:47,600
Ready but they can't, ready but they can't, ready but they can't

1808
02:23:47,660 --> 02:23:52,220
Ready but they can't, ready but they can't, ready but they can't

1809
02:23:52,380 --> 02:23:55,920
Ready but they can't, ready but they can't

1810
02:23:56,020 --> 02:24:00,660
Ready but they can't, ready but they can't, ready but they can't

1811
02:24:00,980 --> 02:24:05,780
Ready but they can't, ready but they can't, ready but they can't

1812
02:24:05,780 --> 02:24:09,780
I can't believe it, I can't believe it, I can't believe it

1813
02:25:05,780 --> 02:25:15,780
Why I'm not going to put that up on the internet.

1814
02:25:15,780 --> 02:25:16,780
Yes, Loki?

1815
02:25:16,780 --> 02:25:19,340
I said you can see why I'm not going to put that up on the internet.

1816
02:25:19,340 --> 02:25:21,420
Some of the folks in the chat room kind of dug that one.

1817
02:25:21,420 --> 02:25:22,420
Uh huh.

1818
02:25:22,420 --> 02:25:23,420
It's okay.

1819
02:25:23,420 --> 02:25:25,980
It's just, it's nothing I'd be proud of, so.

1820
02:25:25,980 --> 02:25:26,980
Alright.

1821
02:25:26,980 --> 02:25:27,980
Whatever.

1822
02:25:27,980 --> 02:25:34,300
Alright, uh, Dark Sakura, while I tally up the cage moats, make cage moats, cage match

1823
02:25:34,300 --> 02:25:35,300
moats over here.

1824
02:25:35,300 --> 02:25:41,820
Kage Mooch. Yes, love that Kage Mooch. She is going to bring you the WTF report, where,

1825
02:25:41,820 --> 02:25:46,340
you know, it's just a story that you could only find somewhere out there on the internet.

1826
02:25:46,340 --> 02:25:50,340
So, Dark Sakura, what do you have to share with us in the WTF report?

1827
02:25:50,340 --> 02:25:59,340
There's an article, actually I found this on DDR Freak, but it was on Yahoo News about

1828
02:25:59,340 --> 02:26:07,420
international robotics show that they do in Japan. It's at the Aichi World Expo in

1829
02:26:07,420 --> 02:26:15,220
Nakagure. Anyway, they had their a humanoid robot with a skin-like substance,

1830
02:26:15,220 --> 02:26:21,420
a working mouth full torso, it moves as though it's breathing, it sits as and

1831
02:26:21,420 --> 02:26:28,860
acts as a tour guide. But apparently the robot was so realistic looking that

1832
02:26:28,860 --> 02:26:33,860
They were pretty much afraid of it, you know, what does this represent for the future?

1833
02:26:33,860 --> 02:26:39,860
So I'm going to post a link to a, there's actually a good slideshow from the whole thing,

1834
02:26:39,860 --> 02:26:40,860
so I'm going to post this picture.

1835
02:26:40,860 --> 02:26:42,860
And you should look through the slideshow.

1836
02:26:42,860 --> 02:26:44,860
They have ballroom dancing robots.

1837
02:26:44,860 --> 02:26:47,860
They have robots that will do your kitchen deeds for you.

1838
02:26:47,860 --> 02:26:52,860
They show pictures of the bomb squad robots, which I've actually, they have employed in Israel already.

1839
02:26:52,860 --> 02:26:58,860
The question that everybody wants to know, though, was she a pleasure model?

1840
02:26:58,860 --> 02:27:01,860
You know what?

1841
02:27:01,860 --> 02:27:03,860
Shut up.

1842
02:27:03,860 --> 02:27:07,860
I've actually seen this. This was on M-Gadget earlier this week. It was pretty cool.

1843
02:27:07,860 --> 02:27:16,860
The whole thing about the robots, too. They had a captioning contest for the picture with the two ballroom dancing robots, and that was funny.

1844
02:27:16,860 --> 02:27:20,740
What are these strange looking gloves the robot has on her hands?

1845
02:27:20,740 --> 02:27:22,300
Maybe it's to prevent those types of things.

1846
02:27:22,300 --> 02:27:23,820
I don't know.

1847
02:27:23,820 --> 02:27:25,340
Maybe her hands are just not finished yet.

1848
02:27:25,340 --> 02:27:28,540
But you know, the thing is that I saw this when I was thinking about the movie that I

1849
02:27:28,540 --> 02:27:29,540
saw last night.

1850
02:27:29,540 --> 02:27:31,580
High robot or what?

1851
02:27:31,580 --> 02:27:32,580
No.

1852
02:27:32,580 --> 02:27:36,500
I went to go see, well I don't want to spoil it because it's going to be on sci-fi in a

1853
02:27:36,500 --> 02:27:46,700
couple months, but I went to see Bruce Campbell showing his new movie doing like a 40 theater

1854
02:27:46,700 --> 02:27:52,240
tour in the United States of a film he did in Bulgaria called The Man with the Screaming

1855
02:27:52,240 --> 02:27:57,820
Brain based on the Dark Horse comics. But the thing is that it's hard for me to say

1856
02:27:57,820 --> 02:28:03,800
this because there is an android moment in the movie, and the robot just made me flashback

1857
02:28:03,800 --> 02:28:06,260
since I saw it last night. You know what that robot reminds me of, and

1858
02:28:06,260 --> 02:28:10,980
it's completely not having to do with robots at all? It reminds me of this really crappy

1859
02:28:10,980 --> 02:28:20,260
Japanese show called Hey Mikey where it's all with mannequins not you know

1860
02:28:20,260 --> 02:28:24,480
like the little you know puppets or whatever we're talking full-size

1861
02:28:24,480 --> 02:28:29,840
mannequins it was creepy as hell I gotta buy that DVD because that was kind of

1862
02:28:29,840 --> 02:28:33,620
like today's special I hate to bring up the Nickelodeon thing too special but

1863
02:28:33,620 --> 02:28:36,380
today's special was the mannequins were coming to life I remember the 80s movie

1864
02:28:36,380 --> 02:28:43,400
mannequin yeah so I think it mannequin too is bad mannequin too was the first

1865
02:28:43,400 --> 02:28:47,360
one was actually kind of good stay away all right what's this face in it with

1866
02:28:47,360 --> 02:28:52,120
the hair so you really in ten years one of us could be replaced with a robot I'm

1867
02:28:52,120 --> 02:28:55,520
I if it is whether because that robot is very realistic looking that's kind of

1868
02:28:55,520 --> 02:29:01,700
scary their robots could walk among us it's like science fiction maybe one day

1869
02:29:01,700 --> 02:29:07,200
can replace my wife with a robot. How do you know they don't already? How do you know they

1870
02:29:07,200 --> 02:29:13,660
don't already? How do you know they don't already? Bad joke. Yeah, the ferret lives

1871
02:29:13,660 --> 02:29:16,860
among them. Here's how I know they don't already, because there's too many retarded people out

1872
02:29:16,860 --> 02:29:22,960
there, so. Honestly. Bad programming. They haven't got it right yet. Maybe the robots

1873
02:29:22,960 --> 02:29:28,660
are meant to do that. I have to program to make-live my sister. No, no, no, no. There's

1874
02:29:28,660 --> 02:29:32,860
There's a difference between being a full on physical robot and just being a walking

1875
02:29:32,860 --> 02:29:33,860
automaton.

1876
02:29:33,860 --> 02:29:37,740
You know if they cloned a sheep first, maybe they will make a robot of the pleasure sheep

1877
02:29:37,740 --> 02:29:38,740
first.

1878
02:29:38,740 --> 02:29:40,980
You know what?

1879
02:29:40,980 --> 02:29:45,100
Would having sex with a pleasure sheep be just as shameful as sex with a real sheep?

1880
02:29:45,100 --> 02:29:46,340
I think more so.

1881
02:29:46,340 --> 02:29:47,660
I love animals.

1882
02:29:47,660 --> 02:29:51,220
But it's not a real sheep.

1883
02:29:51,220 --> 02:29:53,220
Mikotov, you love sheep.

1884
02:29:53,220 --> 02:29:56,300
Do you love animals?

1885
02:29:56,300 --> 02:30:00,300
or one of my three phobias. It's really sad.

1886
02:30:00,300 --> 02:30:03,300
Oh, what are the other two? Flying bugs and water.

1887
02:30:03,300 --> 02:30:08,300
That's four then. Flying bugs, water, and sheep.

1888
02:30:08,300 --> 02:30:12,300
That's three. Flying bugs, water, and sheep. No, flying bugs.

1889
02:30:12,300 --> 02:30:16,300
Oh, like those huge Brazilian cockroaches.

1890
02:30:16,300 --> 02:30:20,300
You don't want to go to Alabama, though, because my mama got chased down the hall by a flying Brazilian

1891
02:30:20,300 --> 02:30:24,300
cockroach. It was really nasty. Yeah, what happens, though, if you find

1892
02:30:24,300 --> 02:30:28,900
flying sheep that's insect-like and it happens to be sitting in a pond. I mean, that's just

1893
02:30:28,900 --> 02:30:35,940
got to be your worst nightmare right there. Sheep are tasty, that's all I got to say.

1894
02:30:35,940 --> 02:30:41,660
Man, lamb burgers, mmm, yummy. Wait a minute, one of your fears is water, Miklazov? He's

1895
02:30:41,660 --> 02:30:44,860
saying yes. Then I have to ask, how do I microfest? I have to ask, what do you think of Ultramix

1896
02:30:44,860 --> 02:30:45,860
Ultramix 3's theme then.

1897
02:30:45,860 --> 02:30:46,860
Ha ha ha!

1898
02:30:46,860 --> 02:30:47,860
Bubbles.

1899
02:30:47,860 --> 02:30:48,860
Stupid.

1900
02:30:48,860 --> 02:30:49,860
Alright.

1901
02:30:49,860 --> 02:30:57,540
Ultramix 4, the theme is going to be shiny lights to pick up the mentally challenged

1902
02:30:57,540 --> 02:30:58,540
audience.

1903
02:30:58,540 --> 02:31:02,460
Because Ultramix 2, did it really have a theme?

1904
02:31:02,460 --> 02:31:03,460
It was kind of...

1905
02:31:03,460 --> 02:31:04,460
Blue.

1906
02:31:04,460 --> 02:31:05,460
Blue was the theme.

1907
02:31:05,460 --> 02:31:06,460
Oh, I'm sure that made you happy.

1908
02:31:06,460 --> 02:31:07,460
Now we've got Bubbles.

1909
02:31:07,460 --> 02:31:08,460
The theme is Dance Game.

1910
02:31:08,460 --> 02:31:09,460
This will be Ultramix's theme.

1911
02:31:09,460 --> 02:31:19,020
it'll be bubbles and then glitter and then ecstasy. I wonder how many of those Ultramix

1912
02:31:19,020 --> 02:31:23,340
games they'll crank out, man. It'll be crazy. Alright, anyway, let's talk about tonight's

1913
02:31:23,340 --> 02:31:30,900
cage match winner, boys and girls. The winner of tonight's cage match, it was no small vote

1914
02:31:30,900 --> 02:31:35,740
tonight, kids. You guys pretty much voted this one in somewhat of a landslide tonight.

1915
02:31:35,740 --> 02:31:39,740
It was song number... three.

1916
02:31:39,740 --> 02:31:42,740
Moki remixing Echo Image.

1917
02:31:42,740 --> 02:31:43,740
Scope.

1918
02:31:43,740 --> 02:31:46,460
How does this win?

1919
02:31:46,460 --> 02:31:50,700
Because our chat room has a huge boner for Echo Image and they have a huge boner for

1920
02:31:50,700 --> 02:31:54,900
you, so when you put two and two together, they can't contain it at their erection anymore

1921
02:31:54,900 --> 02:31:56,260
and it just comes all over.

1922
02:31:56,260 --> 02:31:59,460
I wish that it would have lost so that I could put the good one in later.

1923
02:31:59,460 --> 02:32:00,460
Oh well.

1924
02:32:00,460 --> 02:32:03,380
You know what's funny is I've actually, I was gonna be bringing a different song for

1925
02:32:03,380 --> 02:32:09,760
cage match, but I forgot my stupid, you know, the flash drive that I have. And what's funny

1926
02:32:09,760 --> 02:32:14,480
is I've tried to bring that song two times, and both times I've forgotten or like something's

1927
02:32:14,480 --> 02:32:18,360
happened where it couldn't be rotten. So I'm wondering if I should never submit that song

1928
02:32:18,360 --> 02:32:23,800
in the cage match ever. Maybe it's a sign. I don't know. Dark Sakura is showing us. Oh,

1929
02:32:23,800 --> 02:32:32,420
that, yeah. The robot up close. Oh, it's scary. Scary stuff. All right. Let's see. Dark Knight

1930
02:32:32,420 --> 02:32:36,560
in the chatroom is asking, has Loki's remixes ever took a loss? And I do recall that you

1931
02:32:36,560 --> 02:32:41,480
did lose at least once. Oh yeah, a couple times. Yeah. I don't know what it was though.

1932
02:32:41,480 --> 02:32:46,580
I am not a very good Orange Lounge radio historian. DDR Angel, who hasn't been here for a couple

1933
02:32:46,580 --> 02:32:50,120
weeks, I hope she's alright. I'm starting to worry now, I'm going to call the police

1934
02:32:50,120 --> 02:32:55,120
if she doesn't come next week. But she's a very good historian of the show, so when I

1935
02:32:55,120 --> 02:33:00,680
have questions I can ask her. The last one I think was, the lose was Legend of the Tran

1936
02:33:00,680 --> 02:33:02,680
2005 maybe I

1937
02:33:03,680 --> 02:33:07,900
Think that one did lose I do remember that so I didn't really want to enter that one

1938
02:33:07,900 --> 02:33:12,240
Anyway, so it's one of those weeks. I still didn't have anything to submit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right

1939
02:33:13,420 --> 02:33:18,500
Let's go to a break in this break. We're gonna do just some potpourri

1940
02:33:18,500 --> 02:33:24,440
We're gonna do whatever bovani songs we feel like when we come back from this break the F use of the week

1941
02:33:25,180 --> 02:33:28,460
So we'll be back after this. We're gonna start off this break with some

1942
02:33:28,460 --> 02:33:33,500
Akumajo Dracula Medley from Keyboard Mania. We'll be back after this with the FUs of the

1943
02:33:33,500 --> 02:33:36,500
If you want to start sending those in right now, you can. We'll be back after this.

1944
02:35:03,500 --> 02:35:26,860
When I began to get so anomaly I still needed to join in

1945
02:35:26,860 --> 02:35:32,000
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

1946
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
We can do whatever we want.

1947
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
We can do whatever we want.

1948
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:57,000
Feel the heat of vibrations on the streets, no situations.

1949
02:35:57,000 --> 02:36:00,000
Don't create complications, a lot of people live in life.

1950
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:03,000
But it's all they did in the fast lane, light the yellow, you can't have the dust lane

1951
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:06,000
I've seen so many blood stains, so many tiles with these rings

1952
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:09,000
To find people, see what's high, I'm saving up like the sky

1953
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:12,000
Keep it real, I'm raking lies, that I find the people at five

1954
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
This is your life, no keep getting blissable

1955
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:17,000
That's me with the pain, the puppet fist, yeah!

1956
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:21,000
I see you how I feel in this, I'm not so far away from this

1957
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:27,000
Take another dream in this damn thing, Take another chance, don't forget

1958
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:31,000
It's time to say goodbye to that thing

1959
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:36,000
I want you to know, I'm so sorry for you

1960
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:41,000
I want you to know, I'm so sorry for you

1961
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
I want you alone

1962
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:46,000
I'm ready, you don't need anything

1963
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:49,000
No, it's my time, I need to say

1964
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:52,000
That it's the same for you

1965
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:55,000
You don't need nobody, you can't be me

1966
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:58,000
No, it's the same for you

1967
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:02,000
I can't say it's over, I don't need anyone

1968
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
Oh

1969
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:36,000
Come on, let's play, play it!

1970
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
Let's play it!

1971
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:51,000
Gaming Radio, so uncensored

1972
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:52,000
Ooh!

1973
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:55,000
That even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

1974
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
Uh, Mooch, uh, Moochawkie.

1975
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

1976
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:03,000
He should be a foreign correspondent for us. That'd be awesome.

1977
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:06,000
That'd be pretty awesome. I feel naked tonight.

1978
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:09,000
I have all my clothes on. Don't worry. We didn't turn off the webcam because of that.

1979
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
We turned off the webcam because the webcam was crappy.

1980
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
Because the room's really dark.

1981
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:16,000
The room's too dark and the webcam's not that good.

1982
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:19,000
So when we get a better webcam, we will bring that back. We promise.

1983
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:24,000
We might even get one of those freaky remote-controlled ones where you could control it during the show.

1984
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
I'll hide over here.

1985
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:29,660
the cam next to you so that they can't... I can hold the cam? Yeah, you can hold it

1986
02:40:29,660 --> 02:40:32,380
so that they can't turn it around to you. I should have like a camcorder. You can get

1987
02:40:32,380 --> 02:40:36,300
one of those ones like that you hang on your head. I'll do that crappy MTV style upside

1988
02:40:36,300 --> 02:40:41,620
down and shit. Yeah, there you go. There you go. Um, alright, so what we're gonna do now

1989
02:40:41,620 --> 02:40:45,500
is uh, we're gonna get into the, oh, the reason why I feel naked, hello, the reason why I

1990
02:40:45,500 --> 02:40:50,500
feel naked is because I don't have headphones this week. Um, I broke them last week and

1991
02:40:50,500 --> 02:40:53,660
I have yet to go get new ones, I keep forgetting. Like I remember it was probably the day that

1992
02:40:53,660 --> 02:40:58,660
I needed new razors, I forgot to get headphones, because I'm a dumbass.

1993
02:40:58,660 --> 02:40:59,660
I feel naked.

1994
02:40:59,660 --> 02:41:00,660
The parrot still loves you.

1995
02:41:00,660 --> 02:41:04,020
I can't hear myself in my ears, and therefore my ego is saddened.

1996
02:41:04,020 --> 02:41:08,020
And I forgot to mention earlier that Coach Carter came to my work.

1997
02:41:08,020 --> 02:41:09,020
Who cares?

1998
02:41:09,020 --> 02:41:10,220
No, no one cares.

1999
02:41:10,220 --> 02:41:13,380
But it was cool because he was awesome.

2000
02:41:13,380 --> 02:41:14,380
That's good to know.

2001
02:41:14,380 --> 02:41:15,380
He was a good speaker.

2002
02:41:15,380 --> 02:41:16,980
What was the analogy you said earlier while we were...

2003
02:41:16,980 --> 02:41:23,180
He was saying his, well when he introduced his speech by saying it's going to be like

2004
02:41:23,180 --> 02:41:28,180
a woman's dress, long enough to cover the basics, but short enough to keep your attention.

2005
02:41:28,180 --> 02:41:34,300
Okay, it was cool all the time, I'm just kidding, no it's actually kind of funny.

2006
02:41:34,300 --> 02:41:39,420
Alright, let's get into the FUs of the week, FU people.

2007
02:41:39,420 --> 02:41:42,980
Jamie, why is it that we have to do the FUs of the week every single week?

2008
02:41:42,980 --> 02:41:43,980
Grr.

2009
02:41:43,980 --> 02:41:44,980
Argh.

2010
02:41:44,980 --> 02:41:57,140
The motherfucker who keyed my car.

2011
02:41:57,140 --> 02:42:00,940
I hope you have a plague of gnats inside your testicles.

2012
02:42:00,940 --> 02:42:07,780
Also, you know I'm really not too angsty because I love my car.

2013
02:42:07,780 --> 02:42:10,380
My car fills me full of joy.

2014
02:42:10,380 --> 02:42:17,160
But you know, for you people who think, oh I'm going to pass the lancer, fuck you, okay?

2015
02:42:17,160 --> 02:42:18,300
Fuck you.

2016
02:42:18,300 --> 02:42:26,100
My car kicks your ass, except for that special edition Corvette that passed me yesterday.

2017
02:42:26,100 --> 02:42:33,080
And F you to Krispy Kreme, because yesterday I had my cheat day, and I ate three donuts,

2018
02:42:33,080 --> 02:42:40,360
and they were damn good, but I got sick, because sugar makes my stomach hurt a lot.

2019
02:42:40,360 --> 02:42:45,720
like being curled up in a ball of fetal crying tears down my face having to go to hospital

2020
02:42:45,720 --> 02:42:47,000
type hurt.

2021
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,840
And so where I wasn't quite that bad yesterday, it did hurt pretty bad.

2022
02:42:49,840 --> 02:42:56,360
Also, F.U. to not hearing anything back about money for my injury, so I might have to seek

2023
02:42:56,360 --> 02:43:03,880
an accident attorney so that they'll pay me for the ongoing weakness in my right hip from

2024
02:43:03,880 --> 02:43:05,880
my accident.

2025
02:43:05,880 --> 02:43:12,880
The F.U. to moving, where I'm glad to be getting out of my crap-hole apartment complex.

2026
02:43:12,880 --> 02:43:16,880
It's the whole packing all of my stuff up that sucks.

2027
02:43:16,880 --> 02:43:18,880
It makes me a little depressed, too.

2028
02:43:18,880 --> 02:43:24,880
But, overall, I think the biggest F.U. for moving is the dust.

2029
02:43:24,880 --> 02:43:27,880
I'm gonna lay down the law in the new house.

2030
02:43:27,880 --> 02:43:30,880
The house will be regularly dusted.

2031
02:43:30,880 --> 02:43:32,880
And that's all.

2032
02:43:32,880 --> 02:43:38,880
Let's move on to Loki, if I can here.

2033
02:44:02,880 --> 02:44:10,840
game if you keep you know DNS crashing on me so oh well I guess short doses for

2034
02:44:10,840 --> 02:44:21,080
Final Fantasy and then finally fuck you to round table for your smokehouse combo

2035
02:44:21,080 --> 02:44:26,120
pizza because it was actually pretty tasty but it has barbecue sauce on it so

2036
02:44:26,120 --> 02:44:31,320
that just doesn't fit I don't know oh and fuck you to my apartment because the

2037
02:44:31,320 --> 02:44:37,320
So, for some reason, it smokes uncontrollably, and I don't know why. We have to figure that out, and that's without anything in it.

2038
02:44:40,320 --> 02:44:43,320
That's pretty much all that I have to deal with right now.

2039
02:44:46,320 --> 02:44:48,320
Alright, I'm done. Alright, then my turn.

2040
02:44:48,320 --> 02:44:55,320
I want to give an F.U. to this show that they have on MTV. First of all, I want to give

2041
02:44:57,880 --> 02:45:00,800
an F.U. to the fact that I was even watching MTV at all, but I was really bored. But I

2042
02:45:00,800 --> 02:45:05,400
want to give an F.U. to this show on MTV called Next, because it's the biggest piece of trash

2043
02:45:05,400 --> 02:45:10,800
I've ever seen in my life. It's so obviously scripted. Like, this is why people hate reality

2044
02:45:10,800 --> 02:45:15,120
TV is because of a show like this. And what I really hate is I really hate its portrayal

2045
02:45:15,120 --> 02:45:27,120
I've got a couple of gay guys, because it makes them look all like whores, because when they're like ready to speed date or whatever, the guys who are waiting to speed date are all too busy on the bus making out with each other, and I'm like, you're all a bunch of whores.

2046
02:45:27,120 --> 02:45:39,120
But to be on TV dating like strangers that you know nothing about is kind of whorish anyway. At least they're giving away money so I can kind of sympathize with them a little bit, because I do crazy shit for money as well.

2047
02:45:39,120 --> 02:45:43,760
Well, but f you to MTV for having crappy shows like next.

2048
02:45:43,760 --> 02:45:45,760
So that's it.

2049
02:45:45,760 --> 02:45:47,340
I think that's my only FU of the week this week.

2050
02:45:47,340 --> 02:45:48,600
I've actually had a pretty decent week.

2051
02:45:48,600 --> 02:45:49,600
I can't complain.

2052
02:45:49,600 --> 02:45:55,280
All right, Mikotov, what do you have for us tonight?

2053
02:45:55,280 --> 02:45:57,960
Oh yay, Lion Suki.

2054
02:45:57,960 --> 02:46:05,320
I have an FU to NDAs, because oh my god, seriously guys, NDAs suck.

2055
02:46:05,320 --> 02:46:10,720
FU to, that sounded like a good oh my god felt like, oh my god, I want to tell you something

2056
02:46:10,720 --> 02:46:20,720
but I can't, NDA, FU to the crappy EB employee today, now I have love for EB since that's

2057
02:46:20,720 --> 02:46:28,500
where I came from, but EB guy today was just complete jerk and rude, and the GameStop guy

2058
02:46:28,500 --> 02:46:31,340
it was just a little better so

2059
02:46:31,340 --> 02:46:33,020
as you do

2060
02:46:33,020 --> 02:46:34,100
if you don't like

2061
02:46:34,100 --> 02:46:38,100
or it's crappy game but i can't stop playing it

2062
02:46:38,100 --> 02:46:39,040
because

2063
02:46:39,040 --> 02:46:41,540
it was free

2064
02:46:41,540 --> 02:46:44,380
if you have to go to work

2065
02:46:44,380 --> 02:46:51,380
if you've been drunk but i think is that was painful as funny as it is

2066
02:46:52,020 --> 02:46:53,580
it was cool

2067
02:46:53,580 --> 02:46:55,480
when i was in pain

2068
02:46:55,480 --> 02:47:01,480
Because that drinking game we played, King's Cup, was funnier than anything, until I had to drink a lot during it.

2069
02:47:01,480 --> 02:47:03,480
But, yeah.

2070
02:47:03,480 --> 02:47:07,480
Ef-what the hell? Who?

2071
02:47:07,480 --> 02:47:10,480
N-n-that was just a random thing. I'll tell you later.

2072
02:47:10,480 --> 02:47:11,480
Okay.

2073
02:47:11,480 --> 02:47:12,480
No, it's Ef-3.

2074
02:47:12,480 --> 02:47:13,480
Ef-3 did not know what that is!

2075
02:47:13,480 --> 02:47:16,480
Ef-3, the guy with the really long hair who was up there playing DVR.

2076
02:47:16,480 --> 02:47:17,480
Oh god!

2077
02:47:17,480 --> 02:47:19,480
This is one of his cosplays. I'll put it in the chatroom.

2078
02:47:19,480 --> 02:47:21,480
He's at Sunnyville, all the time.

2079
02:47:21,480 --> 02:47:22,480
Yeah.

2080
02:47:22,480 --> 02:47:28,480
I've seen him as Kai, and FU to him, ruining Kai from Guilty Gear.

2081
02:47:28,480 --> 02:47:30,480
I'm not fair.

2082
02:47:30,480 --> 02:47:34,480
Alright, let's get to the chatroom after this, shall we? Because our chatroom is especially angsty tonight.

2083
02:47:34,480 --> 02:47:42,480
Um, OMGitsdoobs, although he's under the guise of OMGtitsboobs, but whatever.

2084
02:47:42,480 --> 02:47:47,480
FU to SSJ100Matt and MPQ for being such whores about my new name, suck it up.

2085
02:47:47,480 --> 02:47:49,480
Oh, I was just going to worry about your name too, sorry.

2086
02:47:49,480 --> 02:47:50,480
Hey, I came up with that name!

2087
02:47:50,480 --> 02:47:54,480
FU to Orlando for being so damn shitty. It's just a waste of 14 hours of my life.

2088
02:47:54,480 --> 02:47:56,480
FU to Wangan, I'm sorry.

2089
02:47:56,480 --> 02:47:59,480
Wangan, I can't pronounce this word for the life of me.

2090
02:47:59,480 --> 02:48:02,480
Wangan, Wangan, Wangan, Wangan?

2091
02:48:02,480 --> 02:48:05,480
I think maybe Wangan? He missed a letter then.

2092
02:48:05,480 --> 02:48:07,480
Wangan Midnight 2.

2093
02:48:07,480 --> 02:48:10,480
Wangan, whatever. That game, the race game.

2094
02:48:10,480 --> 02:48:13,480
Because of it, I don't like Initial D Arcade anymore.

2095
02:48:13,480 --> 02:48:18,480
And FU to Malaysian people and MMOs because their English is just as annoying as the English of Brazilian people.

2096
02:48:18,480 --> 02:48:19,920
That was good and racist.

2097
02:48:19,920 --> 02:48:25,920
He also says, oh and F you to O2 Jam for having such bad songs. I hate it.

2098
02:48:25,920 --> 02:48:29,420
Moving on, Yuki would like to say, F you to work being so dead today.

2099
02:48:29,420 --> 02:48:33,120
Much as the money would help with my credit card payment, I just wanted to be sent home early.

2100
02:48:33,120 --> 02:48:34,380
I know the feeling.

2101
02:48:34,380 --> 02:48:39,480
Start Tetsuya says, F you to AOL and my phone line. I missed half the show because of it.

2102
02:48:39,480 --> 02:48:40,920
America Offline.

2103
02:48:40,920 --> 02:48:47,280
DJ Dark Knight says, let me just flat out say it. F you to gas prices. Oh and an F you to work.

2104
02:48:47,280 --> 02:48:52,820
SSJ 100 Matt says, F you to real life work for keeping me away from this show and games

2105
02:48:52,820 --> 02:48:57,620
in general. F you to emo. F you to the New York Yankees losing. Laugh now, but they will

2106
02:48:57,620 --> 02:49:06,380
be back. MPQ says, F you to myself for forgetting about the show last week. LemonLimeJump says,

2107
02:49:06,380 --> 02:49:12,000
F you to my town. Period. Reznor says, a nice fuck you to people that think Honda Civics

2108
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:18,420
With blink and outrace anything and another fu to anyone that thinks any NES game sucks because of the graphics

2109
02:49:20,880 --> 02:49:26,160
What about bubble bath babes the graphics were kind of shitty in that game and the game could have been a whole lot better

2110
02:49:26,800 --> 02:49:30,840
Revenge a game was too damn hard for boobies. Okay, honestly

2111
02:49:32,080 --> 02:49:33,060
All right

2112
02:49:33,060 --> 02:49:38,000
Illusion says major major major fu to in the groove shipping not an fu to in the groove but an fu to the fact

2113
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:41,560
that I didn't get my copy my friend doesn't order things online so she gave

2114
02:49:41,560 --> 02:49:45,400
me her money to order the game for her so both copies of the game were supposed

2115
02:49:45,400 --> 02:49:49,280
to ship to my house but only her copy shipped to my house on Friday driving me

2116
02:49:49,280 --> 02:49:53,080
mad with anger if you'd only three people going there you get to keep your

2117
02:49:53,080 --> 02:49:58,040
copy and she has to wait for hers that's the way it works buddy all right

2118
02:49:58,040 --> 02:50:02,640
interesting question in the chat room there vid power says did you know that

2119
02:50:02,640 --> 02:50:05,640
Did you know that AOL has a video game radio station?

2120
02:50:05,640 --> 02:50:08,640
Did you know that ours is better?

2121
02:50:08,640 --> 02:50:11,640
Did you know that we don't give a flying flip?

2122
02:50:11,640 --> 02:50:15,640
Did you ever know that you're my hero?

2123
02:50:15,640 --> 02:50:17,640
You're everything I wish I could be.

2124
02:50:17,640 --> 02:50:20,640
Can you fly higher than the eagle?

2125
02:50:20,640 --> 02:50:21,640
I am the wind beneath you.

2126
02:50:21,640 --> 02:50:24,640
Stop it! Stop it right now!

2127
02:50:24,640 --> 02:50:27,640
God.

2128
02:50:27,640 --> 02:50:30,640
Alright.

2129
02:50:30,640 --> 02:50:34,400
something from old-school NES but I'll wait I'll wait for another appropriate

2130
02:50:34,400 --> 02:50:40,680
occasion to do that um let's see what can we do now we could do some ask

2131
02:50:40,680 --> 02:50:45,340
orange lounge we don't have any questions in yet we're yeah we're

2132

02:50:48,640 --> 02:50:51,640
post to the week you know we have another news story do you have something

2134
02:50:51,640 --> 02:50:56,760
well I guess we're just gonna talk about other news I know it sucks I have dead

2135
02:50:56,760 --> 02:50:59,760
skin on my feet

2136
02:50:59,760 --> 02:51:00,760
that's

2137
02:51:00,760 --> 02:51:01,760
alert the media

2138
02:51:01,760 --> 02:51:02,760
breaking news folks

2139
02:51:02,760 --> 02:51:06,760
PSP home brew on version 1.5 PSP

2140
02:51:06,760 --> 02:51:10,760
that means all you US people that have been waiting for home brew games

2141
02:51:10,760 --> 02:51:13,760
and all the Japanese people have been rubbing in your face

2142
02:51:13,760 --> 02:51:14,760
it's coming

2143
02:51:14,760 --> 02:51:18,760
it's going to be released supposedly on June 15th

2144
02:51:18,760 --> 02:51:21,760
at 3pm

2145
02:51:21,760 --> 02:51:22,760
general mountain time

2146
02:51:22,760 --> 02:51:24,760
and what's cool about it

2147
02:51:24,760 --> 02:51:47,760
All I know is it's coming out in a couple days and that makes me happy because I'll be able to run, like, crappy stuff for the PSP. I'll be able to put all my, you know, Game Boy Advance games on the PSP. How's that for irony?

2148
02:51:47,760 --> 02:51:54,080
And then so basically yeah, it's gonna be coming out it'll be cool and they've got me working for it right now

2149
02:51:54,080 --> 02:52:01,760
So, you know what? That means I'm gonna try to do. Oh, yeah, that's right. We're gonna be putting on the porno games

2150
02:52:04,600 --> 02:52:10,560
Alright all the gals panic I can possibly handle more to look forward on that on the podcast. Yeah, check out the podcast

2151
02:52:10,560 --> 02:52:15,440
Yes, check it out. I have to do this story. It's something you actually posted the site earlier this week

2152
02:52:15,440 --> 02:52:18,260
this is too damn good I can't believe we haven't brought this up on the show

2153
02:52:18,260 --> 02:52:20,960
earlier because we probably could have gone off for about a half-hour on it

2154
02:52:20,960 --> 02:52:25,760
you posted something on Tuesday it has to do with dance dance revolution being

2155
02:52:25,760 --> 02:52:31,240
mixed with fire yes this now Jamie don't get too excited

2156
02:52:31,240 --> 02:52:36,840
this grin on her face got dance dance immolation is the name of the game here

2157
02:52:36,840 --> 02:52:40,680
and you can actually go to this website here and the way this works what is

2158
02:52:40,680 --> 02:52:45,280
Dance Dance Immolation. It's an adaptation, this is from the website

2159
02:52:45,280 --> 02:52:51,000
interpretivearson.com slash DDI, actually is the name of the site here.

2160
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:55,600
Dance Dance Immolation is an adaptation of the popular arcade video game Dance

2161
02:52:55,600 --> 02:53:00,600
Dance Revolution, but with fire. Basically you play DDR. When you do well, the

2162
02:53:00,600 --> 02:53:05,320
computer shoots big propane blasts up in the air. When you do poorly, it shoots you

2163
02:53:05,320 --> 02:53:10,040
in the face with flamethrowers. Yes, you as in your actual body. And yes,

2164
02:53:10,040 --> 02:53:15,080
flamethrowers like the kind that are on fire now before you freak out here this

2165
02:53:15,080 --> 02:53:18,960
is what they say wait isn't this dangerous before you play you'll put on

2166
02:53:18,960 --> 02:53:25,400
a fully aluminized proximity suit with a forced air respirator gloves fireproof

2167
02:53:25,400 --> 02:53:29,240
hood the whole bit these are the suits that are used for fighting fires at

2168
02:53:29,240 --> 02:53:35,120
airports so basically you suit up and you play DDR but if you screw up you get

2169
02:53:35,120 --> 02:53:39,320
shot with fire some more cool some more info on this okay now the website right

2170
02:53:39,320 --> 02:53:44,400
now they just have their testing, their homemade flamethrower that they made.

2171
02:53:44,400 --> 02:53:47,440
So it's not actually gameplay shots or anything like that.

2172
02:53:47,440 --> 02:53:52,240
However, there was another post on the DDR community and LiveJournal, they had some more

2173
02:53:52,240 --> 02:53:53,640
pictures of the same thing.

2174
02:53:53,640 --> 02:53:59,760
But what's going to be happening is they actually have a computer running StepMania with a Firebase

2175
02:53:59,760 --> 02:54:08,600
theme and Firebase songs, like Burning Heat, Burning Up For You, My Fire, stuff like that.

2176
02:54:08,600 --> 02:54:13,600
So it's gonna be Rainstep Mania, if you wanna play this, you gotta be going to Burning Man.

2177
02:54:13,600 --> 02:54:14,600
How appropriate.

2178
02:54:14,600 --> 02:54:17,760
Burning Man, and there's also some Fyre Festival, I guess, in Oberlin or something like that.

2179
02:54:17,760 --> 02:54:23,360
I never got Burning Man, like I understand it's a big thing that all these people go

2180
02:54:23,360 --> 02:54:24,360
to the desert for.

2181
02:54:24,360 --> 02:54:27,840
I don't get it, so to speak.

2182
02:54:27,840 --> 02:54:30,840
I don't know if this is representative of what goes on at Burning Man, but let's just

2183
02:54:30,840 --> 02:54:33,240
say you aren't selling any tickets with this, okay?

2184
02:54:33,240 --> 02:54:38,120
I mean, this is the kind of stuff I would expect to see, like, on Jackass, but, like,

2185
02:54:38,120 --> 02:54:39,480
I don't know, even crazier.

2186
02:54:39,480 --> 02:54:41,680
I'm just waiting for the lawsuits.

2187
02:54:41,680 --> 02:54:42,680
And video.

2188
02:54:42,680 --> 02:54:43,680
I don't think there'll be a lawsuit.

2189
02:54:43,680 --> 02:54:47,080
I mean, these people probably do this with other crap all the time.

2190
02:54:47,080 --> 02:54:51,720
If people are stupid enough to suit up, I'm sure that they have disclaimers out the ass.

2191
02:54:51,720 --> 02:54:55,520
I'm not talking about them suiting up, I'm talking about stupid kids lighting themselves

2192
02:54:55,520 --> 02:54:58,520
on fire.

2193
02:54:58,520 --> 02:55:02,240
Because they see this on TV or something, or they see this in action, they see this

2194
02:55:02,240 --> 02:55:06,140
on the internet? I guess, yeah. Well, maybe parents ought to, you know, take responsibility,

2195
02:55:06,140 --> 02:55:15,820
keep fire away from their kids. Parents just don't understand, you know. So, very interesting.

2196
02:55:15,820 --> 02:55:21,000
If you're interested in fire and DDR, maybe this is the thing for you. Dance Dance, what

2197
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:28,180
was this again? Immolation. Immolation. And of course they have a PayPal link on their

2198
02:55:28,180 --> 02:55:31,980
site because you know you couldn't have this without a PayPal link and the

2199
02:55:31,980 --> 02:55:36,460
festival that they'll be showing us at the crucibles fire arts festival in

2200
02:55:36,460 --> 02:55:41,140
Oakland in July who knew that there was a whole festival about fire Jamie you

2201
02:55:41,140 --> 02:55:46,100
should be going to this I would so you know I'm actually on the website right

2202
02:55:46,100 --> 02:55:51,260
now I would be afraid that like in order to go they would like shoot you with fire

2203
02:55:51,260 --> 02:55:56,300
I know people who've gone oh god that scares me I mean fire is cool and all

2204
02:55:56,300 --> 02:55:58,300
but not when it's on me.

2205
02:56:26,300 --> 02:56:29,820
All right, I think that's gonna do it for tonight's show boys and girls

2206
02:56:29,820 --> 02:56:33,020
Thank you very much for tuning in and listening to orange lounge radio tonight

2207
02:56:33,660 --> 02:56:35,660
We got to wrap it up though

2208
02:56:35,740 --> 02:56:39,260
We got a lot of stuff to do after the show tonight such as tape a podcast

2209
02:56:39,260 --> 02:56:41,340
We know you guys like the podcast if you want to check that out

2210
02:56:41,340 --> 02:56:45,940
Www dot orange house radio comm I'm on the orange lounge radio to go edition. Yes, Jamie

2211
02:56:45,940 --> 02:56:50,900
I'm going to try to scare the shit out of you in my car. Okay, how so I'm going to drive

2212
02:56:50,900 --> 02:57:00,620
All right. Let's go around and get everybody's final thought. Loki, your final thought.

2213
02:57:00,620 --> 02:57:06,620
My final thought is I hope what they're saying about the PSP is true and that I'll be able

2214
02:57:06,620 --> 02:57:12,100
to run homebrew games on Wednesday because I've got, you know, there's not that many

2215
02:57:12,100 --> 02:57:18,700
games out I want to buy and the emulators rock, so go homebrew hoping for StepMania

2216
02:57:18,700 --> 02:57:22,160
imported to the PSP because

2217
02:57:22,160 --> 02:57:23,380
I don't know

2218
02:57:23,380 --> 02:57:27,280
because In the Groove needs a PSP version

2219
02:57:27,280 --> 02:57:30,460
Miele Tov, your final thought

2220
02:57:30,460 --> 02:57:32,200
I like blue alcohol,

2221
02:57:32,200 --> 02:57:36,880
blue DS's, and Russian boys

2222
02:57:36,880 --> 02:57:43,060
uh... my final thought is um...

2223
02:57:43,060 --> 02:57:47,580
I don't have one, I'm sorry, I don't have any... chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, it's blank

2224
02:57:47,580 --> 02:57:50,980
my final thought is reject false icons

2225
02:57:50,980 --> 02:57:55,020
and my car owns you all

2226
02:57:55,020 --> 02:58:00,180

2234
02:58:32,820 --> 02:58:35,660
Hey baby, wake up from your sleep.

2235
02:58:35,660 --> 02:58:39,660
We have arrived on to the future and the whole world is become

2236
02:58:42,660 --> 02:58:49,660
Electronic, supersonic, supersonic, electronic

2237
02:58:51,660 --> 02:58:55,660
Hey baby, ride with me away, we doesn't have much time

2238
02:58:55,660 --> 02:58:59,660
My blue jeans is tight, so onto my love rocket climb

2239
02:58:59,660 --> 02:59:03,660
Inside tank of fuel is not fuel, but love

2240
02:59:03,660 --> 02:59:07,660
Above us, there is nothing above but the stars above.

2241
02:59:07,660 --> 02:59:10,660
All systems gone, prepare for down count.

2242
02:59:10,660 --> 02:59:15,660
Five, four, three, one, off blast!

2243
02:59:16,660 --> 02:59:19,660
Fly away, my space rocket.

2244
02:59:19,660 --> 02:59:23,660
You no need put money in my pocket.

2245
02:59:23,660 --> 02:59:27,660
The door is closed, I just lock it.

2246
02:59:27,660 --> 02:59:31,660
I put my co-plug in your socket.

2247
02:59:31,660 --> 02:59:34,660
The sun and sky is bright like fire

2248
02:59:34,660 --> 02:59:38,660
You and me gets higher and higher

2249
02:59:38,660 --> 02:59:42,660
Out of communication bias

2250
02:59:42,660 --> 02:59:46,660
Only thing can stop us is flat tire

2251
02:59:49,660 --> 02:59:53,660
Hey love crusader, I want to be your space invader

2252
02:59:53,660 --> 02:59:56,660
For you I would descend the deepest moon crater

2253
02:59:56,660 --> 02:59:59,660
Eyes more stronger than dark vapor

2254
02:59:59,660 --> 03:00:02,660
Obey me, I is your new dictator.

2255
03:00:02,660 --> 03:00:04,660
For you is Venus, I am Mars.

2256
03:00:04,660 --> 03:00:07,660
With you I is more richer than all the stars.

2257
03:00:07,660 --> 03:00:09,660
Make our wishes on our shooting stars.

2258
03:00:09,660 --> 03:00:13,660
Then for you I will play on my cosmic guitar.

2259
03:00:13,660 --> 03:00:17,660
Ladies and gentlemen, fasten your belt, please.

2260
03:00:17,660 --> 03:00:19,660
We have commenced our descent.

2261
03:00:19,660 --> 03:00:23,660
I trust you enjoy this flight as much as you enjoy this accent.

2262
03:00:23,660 --> 03:00:27,660
Now, back on Earth, it's time for down splash.

2263
03:00:27,660 --> 03:00:31,160
Into sea of eternal glory my spaceship crash

2264
03:00:31,160 --> 03:00:34,660
People have arrived for to cheer me from near and far

2265
03:00:34,660 --> 03:00:37,160
And as I float I open door and shout

2266
03:00:37,160 --> 03:00:43,160
I am way's biggest washed up superstar

2267
03:00:43,160 --> 03:00:49,160
As for sure as the sun rises in the west

2268
03:00:49,160 --> 03:00:52,660
Of all the singers and poets on earth I am the bestest

2269
03:00:52,660 --> 03:00:55,660
Come let me put the ring of Jupiter on your finger

2270
03:00:55,660 --> 03:00:58,660
And like a smell around you, I will forever linger

2271
03:00:58,660 --> 03:01:01,660
Okay, it's time for end, no more will I sang

2272
03:01:01,660 --> 03:01:03,660
Let me take you back in time

2273
03:01:03,660 --> 03:01:07,660
I want for you to experience Big Bang

2274
03:01:10,660 --> 03:01:12,660
Long live Space Race

2275
03:01:12,660 --> 03:01:13,660
Long live

2276
03:01:13,660 --> 03:01:43,420
Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.

2277
03:01:43,420 --> 03:01:47,180
Alright guys, I promised that after the show we would play this one more time.

2278
03:01:47,180 --> 03:01:50,060
I'm actually going to play the original version of this, though.

2279
03:01:50,060 --> 03:01:55,060
It's very similar to the DDR one, but it's just a little shorter, a little less instruments,

2280
03:01:55,060 --> 03:01:56,060
but same idea.

2281
03:01:56,060 --> 03:01:58,140
So if you guys didn't get to hear this earlier, you'll still get an idea.

2282
03:01:58,140 --> 03:02:00,400
And those of you that did hear it, it's something a little different.

2283
03:02:00,400 --> 03:02:04,940
So this is the album version of the new song we announced tonight, because actually, Spray

2284
03:02:04,940 --> 03:02:09,500
was the first to announce this on their website, The Artist, I Am Gothic, the original version.

2285
03:02:09,500 --> 03:02:16,500
and enjoy.

2286
03:02:39,500 --> 03:02:45,500
Step inside the candlelight, my very own gloom

2287
03:02:45,500 --> 03:02:49,500
I'm just no crazy, I'm considerate of truth

2288
03:02:49,500 --> 03:02:52,500
In the fog, being dark, can't you feel my pain?

2289
03:02:52,500 --> 03:02:56,500
People are all the same, they isolate my way

2290
03:02:56,500 --> 03:03:03,500
Can't you tell the craziest answer of all?

2291
03:03:03,500 --> 03:03:08,500
I am broken, I am found

2292
03:03:10,500 --> 03:03:13,500
I am nothing, I am dead

2293
03:03:13,500 --> 03:03:17,500
I am scary, I am strange

2294
03:03:17,500 --> 03:03:20,500
I am alone and I am cold

2295
03:03:20,500 --> 03:03:24,500
I see a way to where the people come from

2296
03:03:38,500 --> 03:03:41,500
All the pure and pure, all the pure, yeah

2297
03:03:41,500 --> 03:03:44,500
And it won't come very near, dear

2298
03:03:45,500 --> 03:03:48,500
It's okay, I'm free, I don't like your fans

2299
03:03:48,500 --> 03:03:52,500
I don't put any effort in, it's just how I am

2300
03:03:52,500 --> 03:03:55,500
I'm disturbed, I feel hurt, I'm a chance at sleep

2301
03:03:55,500 --> 03:03:59,500
Write new poetry, you can definitely read

2302
03:03:59,500 --> 03:04:06,500
I'm a missing word, it's not easy to find

2303
03:04:06,500 --> 03:04:13,500
Just a missing word to find

2304
03:04:13,500 --> 03:04:20,600
I am cold, I am pale, I am scary, I am pale

2305
03:04:20,720 --> 03:04:27,760
I'm a lover, I am cold, I see affect when people come close

2306
03:04:27,960 --> 03:04:34,560
I am coverage, I am rare, I am scary, I am pretty

2307
03:04:34,560 --> 03:04:41,560
I'm a loner, I am cold I see a picture where the people don't fall

2308
03:04:41,560 --> 03:05:11,280
I am perfect, I am pale, I am scary, I am sane, I am louder, I am cold, I see what's

2309
03:05:11,280 --> 03:05:21,280
I feel better when people don't fall I am your fake, I am failed, I am scary, I'm insane

2310
03:05:21,280 --> 03:05:24,280
I ain't no lover, I have a call

2311
03:05:24,280 --> 03:05:29,280
I feel better when people don't fall

2312
03:05:54,280 --> 03:06:00,820
Okay, there was the original version of I Am Gothic, so it should be an interesting

2313
03:06:00,820 --> 03:06:04,640
next few weeks as we start to learn some more, or I should say next few months as we start

2314
03:06:04,640 --> 03:06:08,440
to learn more and more of these songs that we will be doing the DDR to.

2315
03:06:08,440 --> 03:06:09,840
Till next time, have a good one.
