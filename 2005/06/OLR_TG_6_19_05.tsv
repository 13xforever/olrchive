313	3134	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of June 20th, 2005.
3415	14600	You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
14860	18342	Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
20140	29448	Hello, everybody, and welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio To Go, video game radio dedicated to games that don't suck.
29528	32831	Although, you know, once in a while, we got to talk about some games that suck.
32871	37855	And tonight, towards the end of the program, we're going to talk about movies that are going to suck, I assure you.
38275	39216	My name is Rob Roberts.
39256	40237	You might know me as Sky.
40277	43960	Joining me as always, my awesome co-host, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
44605	48808	Dust, dust, dust, dirt, and cat poo.
50229	51170	How very random.
51210	51911	What's on your mind?
52131	54713	I've been moving and changing cat litter.
55593	55974	Fun.
56534	59336	My life is a never-ending swirl of dust.
59376	60657	I feel like I'm in Kansas.
60817	63860	I thought maybe you were finding cat poo in very hideous places.
63980	67262	Oh no, that would be a cat who would be in a lot of trouble.
67282	67783	Alright.
68944	71471	Also joining us, the one and only, infamous Loki!
71812	74179	I'll take the contents of my wallet for 500, Alex.
77546	80047	How you doing?
80427	81048	I'm hungry.
81428	86810	I haven't eaten since 2pm and it's now, what, 7 hours later?
87310	88390	You could have some damn.
88911	89951	I don't want any damn.
90371	93392	Damn, by the way, is the candy I got at Ikea that looks like Heath Bars.
93452	99115	It's kind of been a running gag all night long on our 3-hour program that we do on Sunday nights via OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
99135	100395	They would know that if they were listening.
101715	105537	I've been passing my time by grading sedans.
106420	107440	Grading Sedans.
107720	108721	Grading Sedans.
108761	109181	How so?
109261	109821	Like cheese.
110121	112422	Oh, I know what you're talking about because I grate SUVs.
113322	114742	The one and only WarioWare Twisted.
114782	116343	I just have nerves that get grated.
117383	127266	I also found that there's one game in there that's completely easy to play and you can get infinite levels on because it requires you to do nothing.
128526	129046	It's awesome.
130967	131367	Anyways.
133280	134481	Mind games with my fianc√©.
134541	134961	I mean, um...
148723	151805	That's just a required part of being engaged to a guy.
152885	157548	I haven't really had a lot of time to play any games, except I did play some PSO this week.
158388	160269	I had forgotten I did play some PSO.
160289	162251	Wait, wait, I thought Blue Burst beta closed.
162291	163071	Are you talking about Xbox?
163151	165732	I'm paying for PSO Blue Burst.
165812	169334	I thought there was going to be a gap between... It went live.
169475	170175	Hey, cool.
170515	174077	So I paid on Monday and played on Wednesday.
174157	176158	Is Blue Burst going to be sold over the counter?
176318	177319	I think it's downloadable.
178072	179033	Puzzle Pirates Puzzle Pirates
194200	196862	Dan's been playing a lot of Initial D ever since I got my car.
197943	201846	For those who don't know, I have a 2002 Mitsubishi Lancer OZ Rally.
202247	209512	Now he's talking about getting an Evolution, so he's been going crazy on Initial D on PS2, making Evolutions.
209593	210794	He's playing an Evo 7 right now.
210954	213736	So I can imagine you are probably sick of Eurobeat at this point.
215129	218410	and he comes in my car and drives it and makes me listen to Eurobeat.
218450	219311	I'm like, no, no, no.
219891	221051	Gorillas.
221091	224332	He does realize that your Lancer is not Initial D, right?
225373	226693	He got challenged to a race, though.
227473	228994	I got challenged to a race.
229894	230954	I'm like, turn.
233555	234455	I have a 2.0.
234956	235516	There's no way.
236576	242238	I know it would have smoked the little piece of crap Civic Hybrid that was challenging me.
243656	245197	Why do people do that, seriously?
245297	246038	Get a life, people.
246598	248239	Loki, what have you been up to, game-wise?
248259	255963	The reason why they do that is because they see movies like Too Fast, Too Furious, and Fast and the Furious, and the insert racing movie here.
256544	259465	That's because, yeah, they're stupid.
259886	269211	Anyways, I've been playing WarioWare Twisted today, and I'm trying to unlock all the wonderful goodies there, and there's tons to unlock.
270145	272970	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
281670	282510	I've been passing my time.
282610	288052	But the controls, the only thing that pisses me off is the camera doesn't change with you when you turn in the PC version.
288533	293475	So you have to adjust the camera with the mouse at the same time and it's not very convenient for me.
293895	299517	So I need to find a way to get it to move the camera with it or something so I can actually play the game.
299537	301438	Did you try the special mod?
302558	303659	I haven't gotten to that.
304119	307420	Yeah, I tried to take her out on a date and she wanted to, you know,
308263	312468	Do a drive-by, because that's what you do on dates in Los Santos, I guess.
314110	316313	I thought that sex mod was a load of crap.
317597	318297	No.
318718	320658	I showed you the stuff from that last week.
320678	323239	I thought it was shown to be a Photoshop or something.
323259	324519	No, it was real.
324779	325680	I have video.
325920	326600	I have video of it.
326660	328000	It's not a Photoshop.
328020	328320	Weird.
328540	329361	All right, all right.
329761	333202	Well, in other news also... It doesn't surprise me, sadly.
333222	338463	In other news, that mod, they've made it for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions of the game.
338583	340544	You can get patches for it.
341224	343825	People will see their boobies no matter what it takes.
363351	368315	You have an army of sluts carrying dildos and vibrators and they are chasing after you.
368395	373298	Meanwhile, you are in a gimp outfit with a dildo.
374759	377181	I was killing people with the dildo.
377561	382084	I went through and adjusted the damage rates for each weapon.
382124	389530	My spray paint was pure anthrax or something because it was instant death for everything that basically touched it.
390450	391211	It was a lot of fun.
392242	396224	Yeah, and we wonder why parents complain about these games.
399906	400246	Whatever.
400286	407209	Anyways, to finish how that date went, my car ended up getting shot up and then exploded and then that was the end of that date.
408149	412171	That's a nice story that could only be told in Grand Theft Auto.
413232	413612	Anything else?
415489	417150	I believe that's all the games I played this week.
417250	420571	Oh, oh, no, I actually did try playing some of the emulators.
420631	423172	I played a little bit of Doom on my PSP.
423332	425973	Well, you've got to tell us about this in a little bit, the PSP stuff.
425993	426774	That was big news this week.
427074	430295	Real quick, I'll tell you about mine, because I actually didn't get a chance to play a whole lot of new games.
430575	432196	I've still been playing WarioWare Twisted.
432236	433876	I only really touched the surface of it.
433976	435217	Now I'm really into the game.
435817	437718	I'm just trying to unlock more souvenirs.
438338	440359	I've got to say, WarioWare graphics...
440939	469564	typically what you're used to in WarioWare sound is you know again what you'd be used to bleeps and bloops nothing too exciting except there are records that you can unlock which is kind of cool because you can unlock like the old Kid Icarus theme as a record and by the way a big F you to Nintendo because the little caption that shows up when you unlock the Kid Icarus record is it says this is the closest thing to a sequel you're gonna get har har har and I'm like bastards you need to do a Kid Icarus sequel but um
470245	476670	You can get records and then you can scratch it using like the twist, you know, because the whole concept of WarioWare Twisted is that you move the thing around, so it's kind of cool.
476990	477631	So it's a lot of fun.
478031	478791	I'm surprised.
478871	483475	WarioWare Twisted looked kind of dumb to me and I was not a big fan of the twist idea, but...
484164	488025	Just goes to show you got to actually sit down and play the game because I'm having a lot of fun with it.
488085	490286	I actually really like the twist concept.
490326	491027	It's a lot of fun.
491467	492367	So I'm having fun with the game.
492387	493908	So I definitely recommend it.
494408	495228	I want to pet the kitty.
496188	498429	That was the coolest unlock that you have, Loki.
498449	504511	I don't have this one yet, but the Mutroid or whatever with the cat with the gun that rolls around on its back and shoots things.
504531	505752	No, I want to do the pet the kitty.
506332	510054	They have a lot of... Well, that was cute, but I want to shoot things with the kitty.
510194	511234	We need Ninten cats.
511499	516461	They have some other fun stuff in there, like you can unlock mini-golf, like a mini-golf game.
516481	518481	You can unlock a batting practice game.
518942	520822	You can unlock a ton of stuff.
520922	533386	I love the mini-games that are tucked away in there, and I think that's where Twisted is really excelling over Touched, because the mini-games in Touched were kind of eh, which is too bad, because Touched, you know, the stylus thing is such a cool idea.
534147	536507	I'm surprised it wasn't utilized, but maybe the game was rushed.
536547	536908	I don't know.
537288	537728	Who knows?
537868	538148	Who knows?
539551	542795	Alright, Loki, some big game news this week.
542835	555329	I'm going to let you start off tonight because that PSP hacking is just... When I saw one of my friends playing Legend of Zelda on the PSP, I was just like, there is something really, really wrong with this picture yet so...
556118	557759	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
579522	584665	You basically have two memory cards, and one of them can be any memory card size.
584845	591089	Basically, you put a small little file on there in a directory, and you put that same directory on another memory card.
591109	594311	The second memory card is the one that actually has the program on it.
594692	598694	So you put the first memory card in, and you load up the program.
598774	603037	And while it's loading, you really quickly swap in the one that has the actual program on it.
603652	604453	and DarkSakura.
632194	633239	What it's supposed to run at, 333 MHz.
636792	638333	You know, it's pretty cool Nintendo stuff.
638454	640495	I haven't got a Nintendo emulator to work on mine.
640656	641556	I've got to try it again.
642057	646080	But, I mean, it looked like it runs games pretty full speed.
646160	648302	I actually saw it on one of my friend's PSPs and it looked great.
648843	649483	I was impressed.
649524	650965	It was just, wow.
651285	662095	Even though these games we've played to death, there's just something about having that whole catalog of games opened up, able to play on the go, on a nice looking screen that is just...
662865	663946	So neat to me.
664046	664366	I don't know.
664426	666007	It makes me want a PSP even more.
666427	669750	Right now, I was kind of like, yeah, I want a PSP, but what do I really want it for?
669790	672812	I want to play Luminous and whatever cool games they release in the future.
672852	678475	But now I'm like, wow, with this trick, I could play the old Nintendo catalog and who knows what else.
678495	678756	For now.
678796	682578	Yeah, for now until they... When's this story going to come to an end here?
682598	683579	Well, there...
684079	692884	They've announced already that you can upgrade your system to a version 1.52 over, you know, you can do a network update, that type of thing.
693424	696406	But who's going to do that because they'll stop you from playing it.
696546	709994	However, in Japan, the same type of thing is happening with the version 1.0 stuff where they'll upgrade yours to 1.52 by playing certain games and they'll have a firmware update on the actual game and they'll force you to update it in order to play that game.
710974	728378	so it kind of sucks but there are ways around it still and people are going to find ways around that too I mean you just watch so it's right now just enjoy it while you have it I mean and avoid those games that will force you to update so that's pretty much it yeah okay we'll see
729031	730271	Anything else you want to share really quickly?
730311	732672	What's going on in the hacking and cracking world or anything?
732832	735933	I imagine that's probably the biggest thing that's got everybody's attention right now.
736013	737034	Yeah, that's the biggest thing right now.
737074	741955	They've got the Heretic WAD works with the Doom thing.
742015	750618	But the second thing that actually was just released not too long ago, which is probably within the hour, was the PSP Personalized version 1.0.
751338	756880	And basically what that does is you know how the PSP has the wonderful graphics in the background and changes color with the month?
757469	758049	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
777620	779581	Weather stuff they've got coming out.
779641	782323	Someone else is working on a custom boot-up screen video.
782343	784724	You know how they have the little PSP screen boot-up thing?
784865	790368	Well, now you'll be able to put your own video in there, and that's something that's going to be coming yet again later on.
790668	796852	Also, there is more information released about Liberty City Stories, the Grand Theft Auto version that's going to be coming out.
796872	799353	Basically, it's the same stuff we already know.
800834	802896	There's not going to be aircraft in it.
802996	806598	The main character, Tony, is going to be voiced by Michael Madsen, which is kind of cool.
807853	810134	The graphics will be better than Grand Theft Auto 3.
811214	814174	New landmarks are going to be available in Liberty City this time.
815155	818975	The motorcycles will be in there as well because you can ride motorcycles.
819215	821536	And the story will be as long as Vice City.
821676	822796	That's not hack and crack news.
823376	825097	You snuck that in there just because you're a Grand Theft Auto fan.
825137	826597	Yeah, because I like that stuff.
826637	826997	Whatever.
827057	831138	Anyways, Genesis Emulator was released for it, so that's kind of neat.
832038	853561	and other than that check PSPHacker.com it's a good resource for finding all your homebrew stuff as far as all the brand new releases for the emulators and what not for those of you guys that are going crazy over the PSP news this week PSPHacker.com and they also have their sister site which is DSHacker.com but obviously not as much news going on over there
854821	855901	Matrix Online is being sold.
880262	882044	Sony Online Entertainment
894002	894983	I'm impartial to it.
895263	895983	It doesn't really matter.
896083	899766	What if Matrix Online becomes part of the whole PlayOnline lineup?
900306	902027	Because all they have are, what, two games?
902187	907990	Well, I don't know if it necessarily becomes PlayOnline because EverQuest is also Sony and it's not a part of PlayOnline.
908331	911593	And if I remember right, PlayOnline is specifically half Square as well.
911793	912293	That's true.
912313	913114	Square has nothing to do with this.
913134	915415	And Square doesn't just have Final Fantasy XI.
915435	920418	They have, well, the Count Tetra Master, but they also have Front Mission Online, their other online game that's going to be coming out.
920438	922319	And they have a Mahjong game in Japan, I believe.
922519	922719	Yeah.
922739	923280	From what I remember.
923300	923700	Yeah.
924090	925371	Dude, I would do Front Mission Online.
925831	926392	That would be fun.
926452	927333	Coming out for consoles.
928594	929555	So that should just be interesting.
929575	939303	You know, Matrix Online, even though we haven't really played it a whole lot and haven't been able to give you a lot of perspective, I kind of think it's neat, some of their ideas, that they have the actual actors playing in the game.
939383	940624	It's kind of neat, I guess.
940724	941244	It's different.
941665	945808	I can applaud a company that takes different ideas on MMOs and games, so whatever.
946228	946469	That's cool.
946489	946589	Yeah.
948636	952058	Let's move on to another story that is just too cool for words.
952118	953339	I'm so excited about this.
954640	961023	This website here, a blogger, I should say, PressTheButtons.com, is reporting that the Super Mario Bros.
961084	965306	Super Show is going to be released on DVD.
965746	969709	A complete series of the programs are going to be released on DVD.
969749	975392	This will include all the Mario cartoons and the Zelda cartoons to be released this October.
975452	976873	This has been done before.
977963	979584	But with only some episodes.
979644	980745	Right, it was like a best of.
980925	987990	So the best of has happened previously, but I suppose due to demand or torrents or whatever, they're going to release the complete series.
988851	993153	I am actually considering buying this because I have such fond memories of watching this when I was growing up.
993253	993654	I don't know.
994134	998117	I don't know about you guys out there, but this show, I remember Friday's Zelda cartoons.
998537	1000558	Well, excuse me, princess.
1001159	1001719	It was just cool.
1001959	1003100	Any thoughts, Loki?
1003300	1004521	Something you'd consider buying or...
1004913	1007614	I was watching the Nintendo Entertainment Serial System thing.
1007654	1008354	That commercial was awful!
1029627	1033510	And if you go back and watch some of those episodes of Mario, some of them were really awful.
1033850	1035812	But the Super Mario World ones were really good.
1035832	1037333	But it's Captain Lou.
1037393	1038113	It's Mario.
1038413	1038954	I know.
1039294	1043036	But still, it's like they made sound effects when they walked.
1043497	1045098	But I thought that was cute.
1045298	1045738	I don't know.
1047139	1047539	All right.
1048340	1049541	Are you thinking about buying this?
1050299	1051300	You own a ton of DVDs.
1051340	1052841	Surely you have to add this one to your collection.
1053422	1054543	Uh, probably not.
1055123	1056724	I've been working on box sets of stuff.
1056744	1059026	I need to finish the Samurai Troopers set.
1059627	1060948	Fine, fine.
1061428	1062509	Hate on Mario Brothers.
1062569	1062889	See if I care.
1062909	1064851	It says that I have all the episodes of Zelda on my computer.
1065371	1065652	Alright.
1066352	1067793	Um, moving on.
1068054	1069295	I just wanted to address real fast.
1069315	1072597	If you guys ever have any comments or feedback on the show, you can always send us an email.
1073038	1076420	2go at orangeloungeradio.com is the address.
1076781	1077181	And, uh,
1077968	1078609	DarkSakura.com
1101448	1105010	Alright, let's do a quick follow-up to a story we were talking about a couple weeks ago.
1105530	1108852	Sony is talking about those porno UMDs.
1108912	1112514	Remember we were talking about a couple weeks ago they're going to release pornos on the PSP?
1113074	1116396	Well, out of Tokyo, Sony Computer Entertainment
1116826	1125470	They are frowning at this whole thing, calling this stuff, quote, utterly undesirable, but we cannot stop software makers from selling such videos.
1126991	1134114	An interesting thing to note, software releases for the PSP, they have to go through an approval process before they can be released.
1134174	1138996	However, the movies on the UMDs do not have to go through an approval process.
1139056	1142178	This is the loophole that the porno games are going through, so...
1143508	1145830	Final Fantasy XII, big news is coming from Squeenix
1167721	1171002	They're going to be doing a party over in Tokyo, their summer gaming event.
1171042	1172162	It's the Square Enix Party 2005.
1172883	1177824	It happens July 30 and 31 at the Nippon Convention Center.
1179144	1184346	And what's going to happen is that Nobuo Uematsu will actually be there, and he'll be talking about the game and showing off some new footage.
1185206	1188087	They'll also be having some of the voice actors there as well.
1188147	1194928	The music supervisor will be there, and they'll have more new information, including some type of surprise.
1195909	1196449	You guys think...
1197366	1198487	You might know any of the surprises.
1198527	1202309	Any guesses what the big Final Fantasy XII surprise could be?
1202749	1203690	You're on candid camera.
1204770	1206871	Maybe Final Fantasy V is hidden in the game?
1208252	1209933	Which was the best of them all?
1210553	1218498	Seriously, after seeing the footage at E3, the new Final Fantasy XII trailer, because they didn't really show any bits of the game, they only showed the trailer.
1219167	1222348	I seriously think it has something to do with an X-Gen system.
1222368	1223268	Surprise!
1223368	1224509	It's cross-gen.
1224589	1226049	It's PS3 and PS2.
1226189	1230171	Or I think maybe with Final Fantasy XI it could be Xbox 360.
1230231	1239294	Now, again, I'm speculating, but, you know, maybe it was the PS2, but I was just like, dang, this looks too good to be PS2.
1239314	1242135	Yeah, but which system had a tech demo for Final Fantasy VII?
1242475	1242955	Oh, yeah.
1243675	1244515	Oh, true, true.
1245736	1246416	That, I would...
1247751	1248812	That's my initial thought.
1248852	1251113	I bet it's something minor and who cares about it.
1251153	1253435	It's probably just some in-game tactic or something.
1253495	1253775	I don't know.
1253795	1257478	Or maybe one of the voice actors has a really big name or the theme song or something.
1258038	1260079	Al Pacino will play the main character.
1260099	1262381	You know what though?
1262441	1263682	Wouldn't that be interesting if it was cross-gen?
1263702	1275690	Keep in mind though, back in the day on the Nintendo 64, they did all the Final Fantasy 6 characters for a tech demo for the Nintendo 64.
1275890	1277171	I vaguely recall this.
1278552	1280213	Square jumped into bed with Sony.
1281294	1281755	That's true.
1282395	1284377	And they've been fucking around ever since.
1286098	1287279	Well, am I wrong?
1287539	1291383	Well, now Microsoft's getting, you know, coming in and wanting to get their hands on it.
1291483	1295026	And in the background, your cheating heart plays on the jukebox.
1297288	1298408	I don't know, I don't know.
1298628	1301329	That's just some speculation, you know.
1301709	1305930	And for the record, I would love to find a ROM or something of that demo.
1306290	1307431	Because I know it exists.
1308211	1310151	I've got the one for Robotech Crystal Dreams.
1311211	1311572	Playable.
1312572	1313032	Very cool.
1313732	1314712	We need more Robotech games.
1314932	1315632	Well, we'll see.
1315652	1317833	That's all we can really do here on the show is speculate.
1317853	1319133	We're just gamers like the rest of you.
1319173	1323074	So I think that would be kind of a neat news, though, if it is cross-gen.
1323114	1325895	But I think I'm just crazy talk.
1327048	1328408	But if you have a suggestion, send it to us.
1328428	1329129	Well, that's okay.
1329169	1329849	We're used to it.
1330289	1330849	Yeah, whatever.
1331829	1332110	All right.
1333010	1342793	Orange Lounge Radio, we're not just here to talk about video games all the time, but we're here to better your life because if we talked about games all the time and never went outside, we'd have no time to take over the world.
1343773	1352036	So we are here to bring you some advice to better your life, and who better to bring it to you than the one and only, the huggable Dark Sakura with her advice column.
1352336	1353436	Are you saying I'm cuddly?
1354076	1354656	Yes, I am.
1355717	1356037	Damn it.
1356874	1361017	Today's bit of sage advice is how to treat a broken nose.
1362498	1363079	Number one.
1363539	1364399	Stop the bleeding.
1364660	1365040	Duh.
1366001	1367422	Tilt your head back slightly.
1367802	1372685	Pinch the bridge of your nose closed, the region just below the hard cartilage, not simply the nostrils.
1373066	1375528	Hold a tissue underneath your nostrils to catch the blood.
1376328	1376588	Icky.
1377289	1377529	Two.
1378109	1379650	Apply a cold pack or ice immediately.
1379711	1380811	Keep your head tilted back.
1380871	1383393	Continue to apply ice as needed to keep the swelling down.
1384114	1384374	Three.
1384870	1388051	If your nose appears broken or crooked, do not attempt to treat it yourself.
1388671	1393072	The only reason to attempt to relocate the position of the nose is if you are having trouble breathing through your mouth.
1394012	1401194	If you aren't getting any air, you can attempt to relocate the position of your nose so that you can breathe through it, but this will be quite painful.
1401674	1402875	Otherwise, leave it to the doctor.
1403195	1405635	Four, seek medical attention immediately.
1406215	1408616	But my final, final bit of advice on that one?
1408736	1408976	Yes.
1409736	1412277	Don't go getting into the bar fights pissed on Miller Lite.
1415694	1416995	Some sage advice there, thank you.
1417375	1417876	You're welcome.
1418416	1419317	I always give good advice.
1419797	1420057	You do.
1420558	1420758	You do.
1421218	1421999	Well, once in a while.
1423160	1423800	Just kidding.
1423840	1428784	You know, you never know when you're going to be stuck in Brazil crossing a piranha-infested river, okay?
1429624	1430745	You never know.
1431145	1431446	I know.
1431526	1432847	I was just doing that the other week.
1433307	1435789	And when was the last time you jumped off the roof of a building?
1437070	1437410	Okay.
1438331	1438771	See?
1439091	1439892	Alright, alright.
1440512	1445076	And, you know, I had to stop a runaway camel the other day and I would not have known had I not researched it.
1445888	1447528	Alright, my bad, I'm sorry.
1447889	1448469	Alright then.
1448669	1450869	Let's talk about Mega Man Legends.
1451369	1455151	Now, Loki kind of brought this up briefly last week, but this is hitting the newswire now.
1455231	1460872	Mega Man Legends 2 is coming to the PSP, and it's shipping on September 8th.
1461012	1461852	They have an announced date.
1462172	1466174	Oh, by the way, that's a Japan shipping date, not an American shipping date yet.
1466194	1468034	Good, why don't they work on Legends 3 while they're at it?
1468814	1471435	Because I already finished the first two games, and I want more.
1473551	1481053	Mega Man Legends is coming out August 4th for the PSP Breath of Fire 3 on August 25th.
1481713	1483634	Direct port to their PlayStation Originals.
1484314	1486614	But they will be reformatted to the widescreen thing.
1487114	1487494	Go figure.
1488675	1490235	So all those games coming out in Japan.
1491295	1492135	Hopefully here too.
1493276	1493856	We'll find out.
1494516	1498517	I do believe that there was also a release date for Papakuros.
1499725	1500866	I haven't been following that one.
1500926	1503128	I do believe that they said August.
1503408	1503849	September.
1505010	1506010	And there was a month difference.
1506451	1507151	Very cool.
1507452	1514117	For those of you guys that like the music games, by the way, we have some dates for DDR Extreme 2 and DDR Ultramix 3.
1515258	1522784	DDR Extreme 2 is going to be out September the 28th with Extreme 2 on September the 28th and Ultramix 3 I get so confused, on November the 2nd.
1528137	1528697	are those games.
1528917	1531538	But of course, subject to change as all shipping dates are.
1534259	1539881	Miyamoto has been talking about Mario 128, you know that official sequel to Mario 64?
1539981	1543783	I don't know what the hell Super Mario Sunshine was then, but I guess it wasn't an actual sequel.
1545544	1549305	Mario 128 is the actual planned sequel, and he has officially said...
1550174	1551575	It ain't happening on GameCube.
1551955	1554896	However, they will be doing it on Revolution.
1555356	1561099	The Mario team can't create too many games at the same time, so they are concentrating on the Revolution.
1563024	1563744	Any thoughts on this?
1563824	1564844	Should be some good stuff.
1564904	1566005	I love Mario 64.
1567185	1577327	I think Mario 64 is slightly overrated in the halls of video game history, but I think it's a fun game and I will certainly be all over a sequel.
1577427	1578707	I think it could be good.
1578767	1583348	Dan and I would play that game together every night for the first few months that I moved out here.
1583668	1585068	What did you think of the DS one, though?
1585088	1587889	Did you play that at all or was the magic gone by that point?
1588609	1589649	I was in school.
1590734	1591214	Caracuri, Gimmicks
1615342	1617347	and basically it's a puzzle game.
1618289	1624143	The only reason I really bring this up, it seems like puzzle games are the big craze right now on the handheld systems.
1625035	1627417	Is it all because of Luminous or what's going on?
1627677	1630439	It's all systems, especially the DS.
1630739	1631380	All puzzle games.
1631880	1638725	It's funny though, try to find a puzzle game that's not on a handheld system that's brand new coming out.
1639186	1640306	You're not going to find one.
1641047	1641507	At all.
1641728	1643249	On the consoles.
1643329	1645430	Puzzles seem to be big on the handheld now.
1645791	1649753	That's because you can play with other people.
1650194	1653997	The DS itself lends itself very well to the puzzle game
1654898	1655298	Puyo Puyo
1683118	1685161	There's something about having the puzzles on the console.
1685181	1687644	I mean, just imagine having something like Luminous on the console.
1687664	1688525	It could be so pretty.
1689225	1689946	I don't know.
1690147	1690807	Maybe it's just me.
1691188	1692630	And you can play on the internet and everything.
1693471	1693711	Oh well.
1694591	1700156	All right, lastly tonight, we just have a barrage of stories regarding video game movies.
1700236	1703439	I mean, there's just an utter barrage of stuff going on.
1704119	1711225	First off, Hitman is going to be coming to the screen, and Vin Diesel, I believe you actually posted a story on OrangeSenseRadio.com about this.
1711245	1712646	Vin Diesel is playing Hitman.
1713147	1713948	Joy.
1714408	1716750	Should be interesting, certainly.
1716770	1718752	He's got to do something with what's left of his career.
1720130	1722872	Resident Evil is going to be having some more movies coming out.
1722912	1725873	There will be third and fourth movies.
1726234	1729615	The third movie, by the way, is called Resident Evil Afterlife.
1730276	1734038	And the movie script was written by the original director, Paul Anderson.
1734858	1739300	However, he is not currently attached to direct the upcoming film.
1739841	1744363	Mila Jovovich, though, is expected to come back and reprise her role tentatively 2006 for Resident Evil 3.
1746129	1749552	I haven't seen the second one, but I heard that it kind of went really crazy.
1750313	1753095	I heard it wasn't so hot, but I don't really know.
1753135	1754256	I don't follow the games enough.
1754977	1757599	Well, yeah, I don't follow the games enough, for one.
1757639	1758359	I mean, they're okay.
1758439	1761262	I play them, but I'm more into Silent Hill than I am Resident Evil.
1761282	1766006	The first one followed very... I think could have easily fit in with the whole...
1767165	1767385	What?
1789367	1793988	Dead or Alive is coming to the big screen.
1794768	1797189	Dead or Alive is being budgeted at $30 million.
1797949	1805231	It's being directed by Hong Kong action film director Corey Yuen, who did Romeo Must Die, which I thought was a very cool movie.
1805271	1809512	Producing the movie, Jeremy Bolt, who of course is also tied to the Resident Evil films.
1809892	1811932	The movie's script is being written by J.F.
1812112	1814473	Lawton, who did Pretty Woman, of all things.
1814873	1842447	and Seth Gross who did Devour which is an upcoming movie but what we should mention I do want to mention this Kasumi being played by Devon Aoki who was Miho in Sin City Miho and also for those who may not have seen Sin City she was also I believe Kiki which was the hot Asian driver that was in Too Fast Too Furious Suki Suki Kiki Suki who's got Hayabusa
1843726	1851020	They haven't talked about... Actually, it's Kane Kosugi, who is in Godzilla Final Wars, will be Ryu Hayabusa.
1851241	1851541	Ryu.
1851862	1852083	Ryu.
1852103	1852704	Sorry, whoop, Ryu.
1853288	1854749	That's my bad pronunciation coming in again.
1854769	1864712	Actually, okay, well, we've got... I was looking earlier at the people playing... Let me name some more here because I have a bunch here.
1865052	1868133	Jamie Presley from Not Another Teen Movie is Tina.
1868713	1872074	Nastassja Malth from Elektra is Ayan.
1872475	1875576	Sarah Carter from Final Destination 2 is Helena.
1876236	1879257	And Australian pop star Holly Valance is...
1879685	1880405	is Christy.
1880485	1882946	She was also in National Lampoon's Pledge This.
1884087	1886808	Professional wrestler Kevin Nash is bass.
1887268	1888169	Oh, my God.
1888549	1892230	Well, the thing is, though, is that in the game, though, he looks like Hulk Hogan.
1893311	1895251	But that kind of makes sense.
1895652	1901574	And Brian J. White, who, by the way, is also coming up in a film adaptation of Tekken, is going to be Zack.
1901734	1904055	I didn't even know they were doing a film adaptation of Tekken.
1904455	1906176	They better have somebody hot playing Gene.
1908464	1910045	Now I gotta look at the Tekken news.
1914268	1917210	Oh man, all I gotta say is they got one hot cast.
1917510	1918911	I need to see this.
1919271	1921293	Kevin Nash is in it.
1921533	1922914	Dan's gonna flip.
1923194	1924995	Brian J. White playing Bruce.
1925035	1926316	That's all they've got so far.
1928091	1929392	Kevin Nash, wow.
1930153	1933795	He was Diesel back in the WCW days.
1933955	1943781	Tekken is being directed by Charles Stone III, written by Michael Cullery and Mike Werb, whoever the hell those people are.
1944041	1948124	I'm on video game movie overload, but I saved the best for last, boys and girls.
1948884	1951546	Let me give you an idea of who Mike Werb is.
1951626	1955608	He did writing on Lara Croft, Tomb Raider, and Face Off.
1955929	1957570	Face Off was a good movie.
1958770	1967777	and also Michael did also writing on Lara Croft, Tomb Raider, and Face Off as well.
1967837	1969198	So that's kind of neat.
1969239	1975544	Director Charles Stone III did Mr. 3000, Drumline, and Paid in Full.
1976825	1978025	That's just stuff we've never heard of.
1978966	1980648	Anyway, I saved the best for last.
1980688	1981088	Come on, guys.
1981448	1982009	This is the best.
1983693	1986434	They're making a movie out of the game Postal.
1986995	1991518	Postal, you remember the very controversial game where, let's see, what's their tagline?
1991978	1996641	It's, I don't know, basically it was just kill people in all the great ways you can.
1997082	1999183	The director who's attached to the Postal movie?
1999764	2000204	Uwe Boll.
2003314	2009705	I just saw the most... Why do they keep giving that man work?
2009945	2017858	He's like, all he's doing is, I'm going to snatch up all the movie rights possible and make crap and keep churning it out over and over.
2018599	2022080	Honestly, people, have they watched these movies that have been made?
2022781	2023981	Save your dignity.
2024001	2029763	Yeah, but keep in mind, half of Hollywood's on drugs, and the other half is, you know, lung liquor.
2029783	2041107	This movie game, Uwe Boll, by the way, for those who may not know, famous for his work on the films Alone in the Dark, House of the Dead, and the upcoming Blood Rain.
2042699	2044321	House of the Dead was funny
2065339	2065920	Far Cry
2082620	2086282	It's the career video game movie maker, boys and girls.
2086642	2088002	Honestly, you know what?
2088363	2091644	I remember back in the day when I thought Mortal Kombat, the movie, kind of sucked.
2091764	2092925	Or Mortal Kombat Annihilation.
2092945	2094725	It's starting to look pretty good right now, isn't it?
2094805	2096446	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
2096466	2100488	Mortal Kombat Annihilation is an hour and a half of my life that I really want back.
2100608	2103249	Suddenly that Final Fantasy movie wasn't so bad, was it?
2103269	2104870	No, the Final Fantasy movie was good.
2105610	2107492	But it wasn't Final Fantasy.
2108132	2109814	But as a movie, it was good.
2109834	2111495	It should have been Alien 5.
2111555	2113017	Here's what it's got to come up with, though.
2113037	2115078	I mean, Rob, it's like this.
2115699	2123105	Basically, you've got a movie coming out this fall, Doom, starring The Rock or whatever.
2123886	2126028	This has the potential to be pretty good.
2126108	2127269	I mean, that and the Halo movie.
2127728	2130170	What we need is good video game movies to come out.
2130250	2133111	Honestly, I am so not interested in a Halo movie.
2133632	2136834	Love the game, I just, I know that a movie will ruin it.
2136994	2138375	So I'm not interested in the movie.
2138395	2139155	Okay, okay, well fine, fine.
2139175	2140676	Maybe not that, but like Spy Hunter.
2140836	2142817	Okay, these movies, they'll be okay.
2142897	2145799	They'll be, they could be good, okay?
2145839	2146440	Could be.
2146620	2146960	Could be.
2147000	2147680	Could be.
2147760	2149221	That's a big if.
2149301	2151263	Okay, assuming Doom is good, okay?
2151603	2153204	Assuming the Doom movie is good.
2154164	2160227	Hopefully people will say, okay, this is what they could be and not let Ui Bol direct anything ever again.
2160287	2164229	In fact, Ui Bol should be... I want to put a hit out on Ui Bol.
2164269	2165029	No, stop.
2165929	2168030	This is downloadable by anybody on the internet.
2168050	2168571	Don't go there.
2168591	2171712	They need to do a movie version of Hell and have Dennis Hopper in it.
2172292	2172773	Yeah.
2173273	2175674	Of course, you know Land of the Dead's coming out and he's in it.
2177799	2181142	Movie Bowl is like the video game version of M. Night Shyamalan.
2181162	2184365	He was just like, Hey, don't insult M. Night Shyamalan.
2184405	2185326	Don't insult him.
2185586	2186007	Yeah.
2186407	2188469	So what if the ending of Signs was crap?
2188529	2189350	I haven't seen Signs.
2189370	2191492	The Village was pretty good.
2191532	2192333	Signs was not crap.
2192353	2193814	The Village was retarded.
2193894	2194775	I like The Village.
2194815	2195596	The Village was...
2196136	2197357	An intelligent movie.
2197497	2198677	I like The Village, you should.
2198837	2199938	It required thought.
2200198	2200578	Oh, wow.
2200618	2204100	I couldn't figure out what the plot twist was going to be about five minutes into the movie.
2204120	2206861	Suddenly, Orange Lounge Radio has turned into the movie poop shoot.
2206961	2207341	I see.
2207481	2209502	Movie poop shoot to go.
2210943	2215485	I think it's time to end this episode so we can go beat up Loki.
2215525	2216045	How's that sound?
2216485	2217366	I drive over him in my car.
2217386	2220067	By the way, you know about that movie, The Village?
2220307	2220467	Yes.
2220707	2222168	It was set in modern time.
2225615	2226996	and the aliens in Signs.
2227677	2228717	Shut up, I haven't seen it.
2228998	2229978	Shut up, I haven't seen it.
2230419	2230839	All right.
2232841	2235443	That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio To Go.
2235563	2236503	Thanks for listening.
2236564	2237224	Have a good night.
2239146	2242748	That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.
