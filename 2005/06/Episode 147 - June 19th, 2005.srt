Don't you have a chance

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Can't you have a chance

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
To get lost on my track

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000

the happiest bunny on the farm, Ms. Jamie Summers, Dark Sakura.

41
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,980
I'm badly animated today.

42
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:59,980
You're badly drawn today?

43
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,520
Yeah, I'm badly drawn.

44
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,520
You were just drawn that way?

45
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,520
Today I was.

46
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,520
Oh, sorry to hear that.

47
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,240
I love the real me at home because she's currently packing up her entire life to the booties

48
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,240
of Citrus Heights.

49
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,240
Oh, okay.

50
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,240
All right.

51
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,520
I've got a house, I'm moving into a house for renting, therefore I have no life for

52
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,520
two weeks.

53
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,520
Fun!

54
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,520
Exactly.

55
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,520
I know what that's like.

56
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,520
Kinda.

57
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,520
Sorta.

58
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,520
Uh, just recently, as we moved in the new studio.

59
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,520
Anyway.

60
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,520
Also joining us, the recently moved Loki!

61
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,520
Hi.

62
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,520
I just moved.

63
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,520
Yes.

64
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,520
Like, to the side.

65
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,520
You moved from the living room to the studio.

66
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,520
It was very nice.

67
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,520
Yeah.

68
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,520
Unfortunately I didn't move to the pizza hut to get myself dinner.

69
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,520
I knew something was missing.

70
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,520
I forgot.

71
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,520
So.

72
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,520
I'm hungry now.

73
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,520
How could you-

74
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,520
I have a salad.

75
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,520
How could you-

76
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,520
Uh, no I don't eat salad.

77
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,020
I'm a meat-a-terian, okay? I don't touch that-

78
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,520
Her salad has bacon bits.

79
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,020
It has bacon and chicken in it.

80
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,020
Yeah, but the bacon bits aren't real.

81
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,020
They aren't real bacon.

82
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,020
Where'd you get that from, McDonald's?

83
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,020
Nothing's real there.

84
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,520
Dan says that salad is what food eats.

85
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,520
Exactly. You know, there's supposed to be one more step before I eat that stuff.

86
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,020
I'm eating this because my doctor told me to.

87
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,520
My doctor could tell me to eat salad all he wants,

88
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:27,520
Yeah, but I don't want to be one of those 300-pound women that walk around in a muumuu scratching their ass in the middle of Walmart with five screaming children.

89
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,520
Dude, I saw that the other day. Sick!

90
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,840

91
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:36,480

101
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,700

102
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,980

109
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,160

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,180
uh... he told us last week that would have been an exclusive but india

112
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,040

114
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:49,840
your work

115
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,460
secret may say something tonight but i don't know he looks too enthralled with

116
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:57,460
whatever he's playing on his brand new Blue DS. What are you playing?

117
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,460
I'm playing the crappy, or actually the fun minigames of Mario.

118
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:05,900
Secret, by the way, for those of our folks who are new listeners to the show, he actually

119
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:12,900
works at the big K, Konami, and therefore, on one hand it's really great to have him

120
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,460
on the show, because hey, who better to talk about DDR than somebody who works on DDR,

121
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:21,620
but on the other hand, he can't tell a shit about DDR, because if they find out, you know,

122
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,340
You know, with the feds listening to this show and all, they'll find him and they'll

123
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,340
beat him up.

124
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,340
Right?

125
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,700
Is that what happens?

126
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,700
Something like that.

127
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,700
What happens to people that violate NDAs?

128
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,660
Or would that be a violation of the NDAs?

129
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,420
They in turn become violated.

130
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,620
It's something like that, unfortunately.

131
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,620
That sounds kind of exciting.

132
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,940
They're beaten by Simon Belmont's whip.

133
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,940
Alright.

134
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,940
Anyway, let's get to a break.

135
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,940
We will go to a break and come back with a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your

136
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,140
Day, the Azoic song we'll play for you guys tonight.

137
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:56,420
as well as whatever else tickles our fancy. Oh, how about this?

138
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,420
Seegerd, now this is...

139
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,560
I always thought this was funny because you work at Konami yet you're a huge Pump It Up fan.

140
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,940
Let's not talk about that. Oh, we're talking about it after this. And this break

141
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:12,940
Some old school DDR songs we haven't played in a while. We'll be back after this.

142
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:40,940
Feel the swim you hear the sound of your master on the run

143
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:47,940
You feel the sense to be the one to come on and join the journey

144
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,940
This is the journey into the night

145
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,940
As long as you start learning

146
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,940
Race is on the run

147
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,940
Are you ready?

148
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,940
Ready for the race

149
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,460
Are you ready?

150
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,780
Are you ready?

151
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,740
I'm ready for the rakes

152
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,740
Are you ready?

153
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,220
Are you ready?

154
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,260
Are you ready?

155
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,600
Are you ready?

156
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,800
I'm ready for the rakes

157
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,800
Are you ready?

158
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,160
Are you ready?

159
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,440
Ready for the race

160
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,440
Are you ready?

161
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,440
Yeah

162
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,920
A place

163
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,920
Where nobody dared to go

164
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,760
The love that we came to know

165
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:04,760
They call me Salladhu

166
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:10,760
And Lord, open your eyes and see

167
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,760
What we have made is real

168
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:20,760
We are Salladhu

169
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:25,760
I've never loved a day that I've never been here with me

170
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,760
It's Saturday

171
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,760
Saturday

172
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,760
Saturday

173
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,760
It's Saturday

174
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,760
Now that I'm here, now that you're near

175
00:11:45,760 --> 00:12:01,760
It's love, love, love, love, love of you

176
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:30,760
You say that love is not a possession You say that love needs fantasy You say we must give this devotion But you don't say that you love me

177
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:44,760
Sometimes I wonder what I'm doing Sometimes I'm cold and serious But when you touch my body and close your eyes My little baby I don't realize

178
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,340
If you can say goodbye, baby tell me why

179
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,560
You don't want to love me just like I do

180
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,380
You can say goodbye, tell me what I got to do

181
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:03,740
If you can say goodbye, baby tell me why

182
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,960
You don't want to love me just like I do

183
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:11,960
You can't say goodbye, tell me what I've got to do

184
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:21,960
And now you're going to blow off the lamp now.

185
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:34,960
Give it the reading on the 1202 program alarm.

186
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:56,960
🎵

187
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,960
🎵 Give me the enemy 🎵

188
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:03,760
🎵

189
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:28,400
After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move marathon.

190
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,760
Nooooooo!

191
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,760
Just kidding.

192
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,040
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

193
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,000
Thank you guys for tuning in tonight and listening to us.

194
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,320
In that break, you heard Ecstasy from Fifth Mix.

195
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,560
Before that, from Third Mix, see if you can say goodbye by

196
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,640
the Cape Project.

197
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,680
And before that, the Olivia Project with Xanadu.

198
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,520
I didn't realize I kind of put him that way.

199
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,160
But that's all right.

200
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,760
And then starting that set off, a little bit of the

201
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,760
Captain Jack with the race, also from Third Mix.

202
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,200
So a lot of Third Mix on that break.

203
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,520
But hey, that's all right.

204
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,360
Third Mix rocked.

205
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,720
I mean, Third Mix was kind of the piece of the

206
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,720
Third Mix rocked.

207
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,440
I mean, Third Mix, Third Mix was kind of the peak of DDR in many ways.

208
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,360
At least a lot of folks that talk about the Japanese history of the game say it really

209
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,440
peaked with Third Mix, and I don't know, song list wise, I think Third Mix is one of the

210
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,440
best.

211
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,440
It really is.

212
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,080
I'm thinking it's all about Fourth Plus.

213
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,400
Fourth Plus was pretty rad.

214
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,720
I mean, I think that would be like, kind of like the peak, but everybody has their own

215
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,720
argument.

216
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,980
Then there's people that say, no, no, no, Extreme's got the bet, no, no, no, no, second

217
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,040
mix for life, whatever.

218
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,040
Step Battle.

219
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,040
Hey, it's all about Step Battle, okay?

220
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:33,040
I miss Step Battle, but I can play it at home on my Dreamcast.

221
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,040
Seegard, tell them to put Step Battle back in DDR.

222
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,040
Can you do that? I'll get right on that.

223
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,040
Because I know you actually write the games from scratch yourself.

224
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,040
With a pencil and paper.

225
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,040
And I put it on the sheet and kind of scroll it down.

226
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,040
That's real hand coding there.

227
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,040
Writing down the code and feeding it into a machine.

228
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,040
There you go.

229
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,480
And number two pencil on Scantron.

230
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,120
Is that how you guys do your dance steps on Scantron?

231
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:09,600
Yeah, but we actually use a blue ink pen instead of number two.

232
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,600
Do you really?

233
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,600
No, you don't.

234
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,600
Do you?

235
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
No, we don't.

236
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,600
Oh, okay.

237
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,680
I was going to say, wait a minute, no you don't.

238
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,400
Stop sounding serious during segments like that.

239
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,400
Fine.

240
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,400
All right.

241
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,400
All right.

242
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,400
Anyway.

243
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,520
with another edition of Orange Lounge Radio Live. You know I noticed that we

244
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,080
kind of had a hit listeners lately I don't know if it's maybe it's summertime

245
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,440
so some of the folks that were listening to us in college dorms just decided to

246
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,720
say see ya and aren't gonna listen to the show anymore but I noticed there's

247
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,440
been quite a bit of a drop in listeners let me put it perspective for you guys

248
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,880
about two months ago at this time we were at our station as a whole was at

249
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,720
3900 listening hours as we say so that means you know the 3900 people listen

250
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,080
for one hour each or some people listen more or less you know it evens out to

251
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,760
that right now we're looking at 2,700 listening hours we've taken a hit of

252
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,760
almost a third of our listeners and I'm trying to think of why that is if it's

253
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:11,760
because just summertime blahs or the fact that we had that life you see five

254
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,280
award thing earlier or if you just don't love us anymore

255
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:21,120
that's it we need to start selling off Loki stuff that's a good idea

256
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,800
put it on eBay. No I think actually maybe what part of it is is that you know we

257
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,840
had a bunch of weeknight shows now we only have one. We can sell Loki as a

258
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:34,240
virtual boyfriend on eBay. Nellie might have issues with that, his fiance. But

259
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:43,240
it's virtual. Like the like the Chi that was on eBay. I don't know. So I

260
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,920
don't know I think part of that might be because we don't have as much weeknight

261
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,960
programming of course the lovely dark Sakura of being the trooper she is still

262
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,400
has her Tuesday night show and I hope you all are listening because it's very nice.

263
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,400
It's a nice program.

264
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,480
I have a few people.

265
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,800
It's something the whole family can sit around the computer and really enjoy.

266
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:05,200
Sure if they want to hear, hi dad, I'm in jail, I like it here.

267
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,800
Yeah so, but no, we're going to remedy that.

268
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,720
We have a brand new show.

269
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,780
I don't know how much I want to say about it yet because it's not done, but we're going

270
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,800
to have a lunchtime show.

271
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,280
So we're going to have programming in the daytime, which should be very interesting.

272
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:23,120
And it's gonna be something that plays for like a half hour every Monday through Friday.

273
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,120
And what it is, I can't tell you yet, but you'll find out very soon.

274
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,120
It's gonna be very cool.

275
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,440
I love, I love the idea, partially because I've worked so hard on it, but I think it

276
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,440
really is a good idea.

277
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,440
So, you'll have that.

278
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,020
And of course, also we had some posts on the forums this week on the OrangeLaunchRadio.com

279
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,160
site on the forums.

280
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,440
Some folks wanted to know, what happened outside the box?

281
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:48,520
Unfortunately, due to real life and people having jobs, especially at employers that

282
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,700
can't seem to give them regular schedules, et cetera, et cetera, we kind of had to put

283
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:57,200
outside the box on the back burner for a long, long time.

284
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,760
So pretty much for the foreseeable future until stuff changes.

285
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:06,680
So I'm working on a new show that will hopefully debut soon on Wednesdays.

286
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,680
And I don't know when that will be.

287
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,420
It will be this week or next week.

288
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:12,560
So stay tuned to the website for more information on that, kids.

289
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,560
It just depends.

290
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,560
This is going to be a crazy week this week.

291
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,560
You know, my birthday is next Sunday.

292
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,560
You're going to be old.

293
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:21,480
What are you going to buy me?

294
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,280
A ticket to help me move?

295
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,280
Wait, that's right.

296
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,280
You're going to be driving the truck.

297
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,680
You're going to be moving next Sunday.

298
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,680
Oh, God.

299
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,680
We'll let you drive the U-Haul.

300
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,680
You do not want me driving the U-Haul.

301
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,280
That is some scary shit right there.

302
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,300
I cannot drive U-Hauls.

303
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,300
So you don't want me doing that.

304
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:41,480
But actually next Sunday, June the 26th, is my actual birthday birthday.

305
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:46,660
And because Dark Soccer is moving, and because I have my birthday, we are not going to have

306
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,660
a live show that night.

307
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,660
I don't think.

308
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,660
No!

309
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,660
No live show that night.

310
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,700
But we will have something else in our place.

311
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:59,080
And then, but in two weeks, when we come back July 3rd, huge show because it's our three

312
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,460
year anniversary, if you can believe it.

313
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,960
Three years of doing this crap.

314
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:10,160
Three years, three studios, three hosts, three migraines every week.

315
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,760
All kinds of aches and pains.

316
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,960
Yes, so we've got that to look forward to.

317
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,560
Torture, torture.

318
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,560
Yep.

319
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:22,160
All right, so that'll be coming on July 3rd, of all things, so that's like, you know, July

320
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,440
3rd, it's three years, dah, dah, dah.

321
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,840
We'll try to get some fun guests lined up for that show, too.

322
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,080
I think that would be fun.

323
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,200
We should get some guests here that we haven't had for a while.

324
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,440
Maybe we can get Mr. Spanky.

325
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,440
I don't know.

326
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,440
We'll see.

327
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,720
Anyway, enough of me blabbing, let's talk about our weeks and our days, and what's going

328
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:45,920
on in the wonderful life of yourself, starting off with the one and only, Dark Sakura.

329
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:56,720
My week has been just work and moving, and lots and lots of pain, not the band, but they're

330
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:04,680
But I've been having a flare-up from my car accident.

331
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:09,400
I am having some pretty bad muscle spasms around my right hip, so I scheduled myself

332
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:14,980
an appointment to see the doctor, who gave me more lovely Vicodin, a new muscle relaxer

333
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:21,960
called Robaxin, I think is what it's called, something like that, and more ibuprofen, lots

334
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:27,400
and lots of lovely refills of everything, and then also told me that the reason why

335
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:34,400
I'm having other pain is because my diet is, uh, hurting my digestion. So I get to completely

336
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:41,960
change how I'm eating, which is a lot of fun. So, yeah, salad. Um, other than that, I've

337
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:50,060
been doing nothing but moving. I haven't played any games, really, except for, like, a couple

338
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:54,020
the games on the Gorillaz site before I found out that we're actually moving next weekend

339
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,820
and not a weekend after. Fun.

340
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:07,400
How exactly do you take news like that? With a WTFucking F? That's just not like a what

341
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:12,880
the fuck, it's what the fucking fuck. To put it in perspective, you've got what

342
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,300
the fuck and then what the fucking fuck. But I did get through a lot of stuff yesterday

343
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:29,000
and today. I also got Tanda to take me to Outback. Mmm ribs. But I found a bunch of

344
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,480
stuff I bought from Alabama including a whole bunch of Superman comics and like

345
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:39,120
New Mutants all the stuff I was into. I found one of my old RPG journals from

346
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,080
when I played D&D. It was great. Found old character sheets, lots of old nerdy crap.

347
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:51,080
I found my e20s. Oh, I kept all those together. I know where my dice are. No, no, we ain't

348
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:58,840
having that. You're a total geek, I love it. I also did find my sketchbook from 1996. I

349
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:09,560
want to take you back, take you back. Okay. Sorry. That was when I was living in the college

350
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:15,440
dorms so I'll uh I maybe I'll scan a couple and put them up I also found a

351
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:22,920
picture of from my first anime expo when I had long hair and that was scary so

352
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:28,600
maybe those will find their way onto the internet because actually I look a lot

353
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:33,720
better now than I did then because my first year here I put on like 10 pounds

354
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:40,400
right away. California will do that to you. Either that or making anorexic. See the one

355
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:48,400
extreme or the other. Yeah, but that's it for me. Other than I hate dust! Alright, moving

356
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:55,320
on. Loki! Hey, how was your week? How was your day? Huh? Oh. Yeah, we do a show here,

357
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:16,320
That's right. Um, well let's see what I do this week. Um, well finally, my purchase of, um, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas has finished, so I was able to play my game, legally. And, um, so, it was quite interesting because I was trying out every single mod.

358
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,320
Did the credit card get held up? What exactly slowed this down?

359
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:26,240
You have to understand, you see, that, you know, when you're shipping stuff, sometimes,

360
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,120
you know, the truck breaks down or whatnot.

361
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,120
Right.

362
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,120
But over the internet sometimes...

363
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,720
Or when you're in a queue.

364
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,720
I know, I know.

365
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,720
They just...

366
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,200
For some reason, you know, the last bit of the game just, you know, wouldn't ship or

367
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,280
wasn't ready to ship right away for like about a week, you know, I guess as a manual or a

368
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,820
sticker or something.

369
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:50,240
So I had to wait for a while for it to get done shipping and then I was ready to go play

370
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,880
my brand new game and so anyways the graphics are awesome and I got to actually try out

371
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:01,840
some of the mods in it so it was the first thing I did I modded the trash master to be

372
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:08,660
super fast and handle like crazy so that was fun and then for some reason I did this code

373
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:14,400
where it says become a slut magnet and so I put it in and for some reason I was in the

374
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:20,040
the GIMP outfit with the dildo and my army of sluts following me, so that was interesting.

375
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:25,040
And then, um, uh, what else? Remind me to save that clip for the next intro.

376
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:37,040
Uh, nice. Thank you. You're welcome. Appreciate it. Anyway, I want that, I want that on, like,

377
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,800
one button demand, where I can push a button and I can hear Loki talking about it. Hey,

378
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:45,060
This isn't the first time that a clip of me talking about Grand Theft Auto has been used

379
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,060
in one of our intros.

380
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,420
That's very true.

381
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:53,220
Anyways, um, so, after playing around with the game some, um, what was it, actually the

382
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,500
only thing that pissed me off about the game is the controls in it because you have to

383
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,580
kind of use the mouse and keyboard and I hate that because I don't play first person shooters

384
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:07,900
so I don't like the mouse keyboard thing, I like, you know, just one thing and be done

385
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:13,460
with it but no whatever I'll figure a way around that then other than that

386
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:21,300
we're just scoping out locations for the wedding I think we found one and pretty

387
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:25,380
much that's it I got I found I got spending our thousand dollars for even

388
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:31,180
more rings this okay the woman is getting three goddamn rings okay she's

389
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:35,120
getting she's getting ring number one which is the current ring now that she

390
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,200
picked out and guess what? You can't make a wedding band for it. It would have to be

391
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:45,080
custom made. So she gets engagement ring number two. Make her pawn it. She won't. She has

392
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:50,480
sentimental attachments. Anyways, so she gets. I have sentimental attachments for my money.

393
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:56,720
She gets engagement ring number two, okay, and then wedding band. And so engagement ring

394
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,980
number two is now being referred to as the bling ring. So she's getting the bling ring

395
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,860
and then she has the ring engagement ring and then her wedding band.

396
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,860
And how many rings do you get?

397
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,540
I get one.

398
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,540
One student ring.

399
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,540
You know what?

400
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,540
She's paying for that ring.

401
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,540
Oh, that's nice.

402
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,540
Okay.

403
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,140
But I have to pay for the other three, okay?

404
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,140
You know what?

405
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:19,500
I think this whole wedding ring business is retarded, because the only reason that...

406
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:24,940
See, Dan and I are having one each, and we're having them custom made to match.

407
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,420
Together the price is $650.

408
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,020
Damn straight, that's what I'm saying, but...

409
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,860
I want it made out of titanium.

410
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:36,020
uh... mine was going to be made out of tan but it's too dark so here's what i want for

411
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:39,540
my wedding instead of the rings cause rings sit on my finger get dusty i have to get them

412
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:42,540
cleaned i want wedding sex that's what i want

413
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:47,340
well i'm getting that too but you know i mean you know i'd get that without a wedding

414
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:52,120
see the ring the ring is made to you know so when it's i guess

415
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,980
i guess you'd call it like uh...

416
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:58,260
you know uh... it's the collar of bondage

417
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,260
I guess.

418
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:05,780
It's a chick magnet is what it is, because you know women love married men.

419
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:09,180
You know how when you take magnets and you put the negative against the negative and

420
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:13,020
they won't stick together for any reason, in fact, they push each other away with great

421
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,280
force.

422
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,300
That's what the wedding ring does in the chick magnet sense.

423
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:25,180
No, I think you misinformed, but anyways, sorry, I don't understand your hetero-culture.

424
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:30,580
I don't understand women either, so, you know, we're pretty even on it.

425
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:34,980
You know what, I don't understand other women myself, because I think that this whole...

426
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,620
I think the whole wedding business is retarded.

427
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,620
Damn straight!

428
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,140
Why the hell do we have to spend so much money after one fucking day?

429
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,820
I'm getting married in the backyard, and the ceremony isn't going to be longer than five

430
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:49,180
minutes, and then I'm going to have a party and get fucking drunk!

431
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:53,280
I just want to point out, Orange Lounge Radio is here bridging the gap between straight

432
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:58,120
men and gay men, because we can at least agree on one thing.

433
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,120
Women are crazy.

434
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,400
Damn straight, and I can say this because I'm certifiably nuts.

435
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,040
Anyways, so yeah, we've already set a date.

436
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,100
It is on a Sunday, but it is next year.

437
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:15,640
And yeah, and I won't be going to E3 next year, unfortunately, because that falls the

438
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,760
week after the wedding, which that won't be good.

439
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,560
Why do you think I rescheduled mine away from April?

440
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,040
Oh, I'm doing mine in three months.

441
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,160
Fire!

442
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,200
I don't care.

443
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,200
I mean, ironically enough, they'd probably be paying my way.

444
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,000
Make her come with.

445
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,400
We'll introduce her to celebrities.

446
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:36,440
In a relationship, there must always be compromise, not,

447
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,000
you know, OK, whatever you say.

448
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Yeah, but I don't think honeymoon over, uh,

449
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,240
I don't think I'm going to win that, you know?

450
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:45,840
All right.

451
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,560
But anyways, so yeah, yeah.

452
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,240
But this will be the night she's listening,

453
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,540
and your ass is dead when you get home.

454
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,540
She's not listening.

455
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,460
She doesn't even know how to listen to this show.

456
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,460
All right.

457
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:04,660
I started planning a wedding, an actual wedding.

458
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,660
I went on one of those retarded websites

459
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,460
that gives you a budget.

460
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:12,940
And I saw all this paying for this crap and this crap and this.

461
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,620
A nude mariachi band?

462
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,220
No.

463
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:20,620
And I was like, they started off the budget at like $7,000.

464
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:24,620
And I'm like, fuck a bunch of that! That's, you know, like, all my savings right now!

465
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,620
I'd be lucky if ours was $7,000.

466
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:32,620
So basically, ours is probably- we're probably gonna get out of my wedding for under $1,000.

467
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,620
Under $1,000.

468
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:40,620
And then probably go spend another $1,000 when we have our two days at Disneyland honeymoon.

469
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,620
And then come back home and go to work.

470
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:47,620
You know, we've been together for seven years already. We don't need all this bullshit.

471
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:51,620
Now I'm wondering since gays can't technically get married, can we get some kind of discount?

472
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:58,620
That's what I'm wondering. Since we get discount weddings, do we get discounts on the costs?

473
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,620
Just curious.

474
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:03,620
No, that's all though for a gay wedding. They had this on...

475
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,620
Oh God, I don't even remember which show it was.

476
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,620
Probably something on Bravo, probably.

477
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:27,620
Well, one of my friends was telling me about some other friends of hers who actually had their last names combined into one new last name.

478
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:34,580
One of my friends was telling me about some other friends of hers who actually had their

479
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:38,900
last names combined into one new last name effective when they were married.

480
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,900
I've heard of that kind of stuff.

481
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,620
I'm going to have a fucked up last name.

482
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,620
I just want the tax breaks.

483
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,420
I'm going to have a fucked up Dutch last name.

484
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:49,940
I have no Dutch blood in me.

485
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:57,100
Wait a minute, now without giving away the soon to be Mister's last name, does it start

486
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:01,660
with the same three letters that my last name does? No. My real one? No. Oh, I thought it

487
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:06,660
did. Because that would have been funny if we were both... I know, if you want some Dutch

488
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:13,660
blood in your system, we can go find a Dutch virgin that you can convert over to a man.

489
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:21,060
I'm half Dutch, don't do that. I'm not against anyone Dutch, mind you, because there's you

490
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:25,260
you and there's yeah yeah I'm sitting right here so say it I'm I'm got the

491
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:31,140
tons of Celtic and then you know Slavic mix which means I can't out drink

492
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:35,820
anybody and it also means you're very Enya-esque

493
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:44,300
anyways yeah we looked at the wedding location crap and that's about it I

494
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:48,420
thought about playing Final Fantasy but I had other things I was working on so I

495
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:57,120
I can't do that. I've started to get another project, so this one does not involve any

496
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:05,420
actual purchasing of anything or any sort of actual monetary dedication. So, yeah. But

497
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:11,480
it's going to take a very, very, very, very, very long time to finish.

SSJ100Matt says they say 65 to 75 percent of men masturbate on their

500
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:31,640
honeymoon. Also 53 percent of statistics are made up on the spot I

501
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:38,960
guess I don't know. All right anyway let's move on. Loki did you have any

502
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,960
thoughts?

503
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,960
God damn!

504
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,960
Ow!

505
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,960
My foot!

506
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,960
Why did I shoot myself in my foot?

507
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,960
I didn't do it in the conversation.

508
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,960
No!

509
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,960
My foot!

510
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,960
I need that for walking!

511
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:58,080
No, we were talking about clips of you that I like to have.

512
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,080
I like to have them handy.

513
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:04,640
I like to save them for a rainy day because, you know, some days I'm feeling sad and I

514
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:10,020
I got yelled at at work and you know I'm not able to do something on the computer or something

515
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:17,120
so I have to come in and then I get cheered up.

516
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:21,760
I'm working on something cool. It'll be fun.

517
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,840
Seegard. Hi. How was your week? How was your day?

518
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,080
Why did we switch back to my old name from last year?

519
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,040
I don't know. I felt...

520
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,040
You have many names.

521
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,040
It's confusing to me.

522
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,040
or no, we're not having a show next week.

523
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,040
If you're next, yeah, we'll just call you Seagletov.

524
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,040
I like that.

525
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,040
I don't.

526
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,040
Well, could I call you Mickey Gert?

527
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,040
That's kind of funny.

528
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,040
I called you Mickey Gert last week,

529
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,040
but I think more people know you as Seagert.

530
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,040
More people know you as Seagert.

531
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,040
I think I should have called you Seagert last week.

532
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,040
Okay, but it doesn't matter to me.

533
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,040
Nobody cares anymore anyway.

534
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,040
You're too busy writing in pencil, too.

535
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,040
Dude, I'm playing minigames.

536
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,260
We're talking about work, I thought we were talking about now.

537
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,140
I got my hair cut.

538
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,140
That's about it.

539
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,140
And it's cute.

540
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,140
Thank you.

541
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,140
I like his new haircut quite a bit.

542
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,180
It's too bad the webcam sucks and we can't use it right now.

543
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,980
I can hold the microphone up to my hair and see if that helps.

544
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,980
Okay, let's see.

545
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:18,740
Do you hear that, y'all?

546
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:19,740
That sounds like hair.

547
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,980
That sounds like hair.

548
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,580
I didn't do much else.

549
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:28,300
I worked and I came here and...

550
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:32,220
Any songs getting you stuck in your head at work lately?

551
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:39,020
Only the ones I keep on my PSP from Echo Image that has nothing to do with DDR, or my British

552
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:41,060
band Manson I like.

553
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,540
I see.

554
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,540
Just prying.

555
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:48,300
The only thing to drink?

556
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,300
Forget it.

557
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,300
What?

558
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,300
I don't understand.

559
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:55,460
You have no idea how much Radiohead I've been listening to the last week.

560
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,460
Why?

561
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,460
Is that your angry band?

562
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:03,820
is not an angler than my depressed band. That makes sense. Every other song that popped

563
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:10,280
up on my iPod has been Radiohead or Super Furry Animals. My depressed music, and I hate

564
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,940
to admit this because it's going to make me sound so gay, but my depression music is Tori

565
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:19,780
Amos. Like, if I break it out the Tori, just get away. I wanted to slit my wrist after

566
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:26,940
listening to a combo of Radiohead, Bjork, Gloomy Sunday, and Tori Amos. You know, I

567
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:30,940
I wanted to slit my wrists after hearing Bjork's latest album as well, but that's just because it fucking sucked.

568
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:33,940
I liked it. I thought it was very stylish.

569
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,940
I didn't like it. That's alright.

570
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,940
That's because you need to expand your horizons.

571
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:39,940
Broaden them.

572
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:45,940
Hey, my musical horizons are very broad. I mean, look at my selection.

573
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,940
Trans-Ombiate!

574
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:52,940
Britney, Christina, Hilary Duff, Backstreet Boys...

575
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,940
No, I'm kidding. I don't listen to that crap.

576
00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:02,180
You have one Britney Spears song. You have the expansive music taste of a teenage girl.

577
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:05,220
Yes, that's a very good description.

578
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:10,980
Thank you. Speaking of music, it's quite funny. You know that one song by Gwen Stefani,

579
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,980
Hollaback Girl? Never heard it, thank God.

580
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:17,540
This shit is Bananas. B-A-M-A. Yeah, okay.

581
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:21,860
So Nellie was singing the song like all week but with the wrong lyrics

582
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:25,060
because she didn't know what the lyrics were and I'm trying to remember where they were but it's

583
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:29,720
something about kenny rogers eight micah eight no carlum back girl or

584
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,920
something like that

585
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:35,200
uh... put it was really weird

586
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,200
being

587
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:43,200
the

588
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,540
fighting may have a lot of that i don't know what to do

589
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,340
i don't think that no where she's

590
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,540
her lyrics are actually better than the song so

591
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,840
i will never

592
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,960
ever

593
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,760
ever support anything gwen stephanie does ever again

594
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,960
is this have to do with the fact that every photo she's in now she's with

595
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,720
these like totally fake japanese girls

596
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,560
has everything to do with that

597
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,520
scariest

598
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,060
i do not do you think she's a japanese girl cuz she's not

599
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:14,520
what she is doing is actually very damaging to

600
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,140
women in general

601
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,600
that's like saying shane's black

602
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,280
uh...

603
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:27,380
Gwen Stefani no longer receives any bit of support from me that I might ever have.

604
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,380
Never.

605
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,380
You know what's weird?

606
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,260
She is a waste of human flesh.

607
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,260
I was...

608
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,460
And she can't sing for shit.

609
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:38,060
We were listening to the first, well I mean no doubt had what, three albums before they

610
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,060
got big.

611
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,060
So we were listening to their first big album.

612
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,060
Tragic Kingdom, is that it?

613
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,420
We were listening to Tragic Kingdom the other day in the car.

614
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:47,180
And I was looking at the linear notes, because I was like the one person that never bought

615
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,180
Tragic Kingdom.

616
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,180
I'm assuming...

617
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,180
I have it.

618
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,180
You have it?

619
00:39:51,180 --> 00:40:00,180
I thought that the first one, yeah, I thought back then I thought it was funny. Yeah, no, no. Now I can't, I can't- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I haven't gotten to my point yet.

620
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:09,180
But I was looking at the linear notes, I was looking at the pictures and I was like, oh my god, they're so young in these pictures. Like, they're like five years younger than I am now.

621
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:20,180
And that just made me feel old. When Gwen Stefani looks like five years younger than me, that makes me feel really old. I just wanted to share that.

622
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:32,020
I got a new high score right now on my Mario game.

623
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,020
Very nice.

624
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,180
What Mario game?

625
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:37,580
The one where you hit the shells with the paddle.

626
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,700
Good job.

627
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:45,140
Alright, my week and my day was okay, I guess.

628
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,380
I just did the work thing.

629
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:51,760
And yesterday I went to IKEA with some friends, including Sigurd, because we picked him up

630
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,520
at the BART and then went over to IKEA.

631
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:58,620
And if they don't have IKEA in your neighborhood, then too bad for you because IKEA is very

632
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:05,900
cool and they sell like, it's totally like my first apartment, the store.

633
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,900
It's great.

634
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,380
And they have, you know, stuff that you, it's Lego furniture because you take it home and

635
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,700
build it yourself.

636
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:16,620
And I was being a real nasty bitch though because I hadn't eaten in like 12 hours and

637
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:19,740
I was getting a massive headache it was really really bad like I don't know what

638
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:25,440
it was and so the only cure was Swedish meatballs from Ikea so I had to wait in

639
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,480
line for like 30 minutes to get Swedish meatballs and that was cool because

640
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:34,020
Swedish meatballs rock and then we my buddy John bought like a new bookshelf

641
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:37,440
and it was so big that it wouldn't fit in the trunk of his car so he had to lay

642
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,520
it out in the backseat except the only problem was is that he was taking five

643
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:44,220
people in his car so there were three of us in the backseat with a new bookshelf

644
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:47,860
shelf, and I think my feet are still in a little bit of pain. I don't know about you,

645
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:52,500
Sigurd, but my feet are in pain.

646
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:57,420
You don't know pain until you ride in the back of VW Bug crammed with four people in

647
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,420
the back seat.

648
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:05,500
You don't know pain until you're forced to sit through a Britney Spears marathon.

649
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,060
Which we might do tonight if we run out of show.

650
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:12,820
Actually, I do know that kind of pain, because I sat through a marathon of, what was it,

651
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:13,820
Chaotic.

652
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:17,820
I just found out that I'm going to go see George Carlin on the 9th.

653
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:18,820
Well, that's kind of cool.

654
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:23,820
Yeah. And then go see the guy who does the Here's Your Sign.

655
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:26,820
You know, when you first said George Carlin, this is what a dummy I am.

656
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:31,820
When you first said George Carlin, I was thinking of the guy from the P-Funk All-Stars with, like, the rainbow in his hair.

657
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:32,820
That's...

658
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,820
I know, it's something completely different.

659
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:34,820
Clinton.

660
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,820
It's George Clinton.

661
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:38,820
I'm like, wait a minute. No, no, no.

662
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,820
Dude, I'd go see Carlin too if I could.

663
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:48,820
I know, but I can totally see you at a Parliament-funk concert, it'd be hilarious.

664
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,820
George Carlin is freaking awesome.

665
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:55,820
Yeah, and then George Carlin is the seven words you can't say guy.

666
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:58,820
And then what's his name? Bill Engvall?

667
00:42:58,820 --> 00:42:59,820
Engvall.

668
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,820
We're going to go see him in November.

669
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:04,820
Bill Engvall is with Blue Collar TV, and I don't like that show.

670
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:09,380
There's one, no actually one of the guys that's on the Blue Collar Comedy Tour, the like really

671
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:13,340
angry one, he's actually pretty good because his comedy isn't all redneck comedy, it's

672
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,620
just pretty, it's just normal comedy.

673
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:20,240
Whereas like, you know, Jeff Foxworthy couldn't do normal stand-up comedy, you know, his life

674
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,240
depended on.

675
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:25,620
Um, but I can't remember if Bill Engvall's the good one or not, it's um, the guy that's

676
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:29,180
in the black, like, like shirt or whatever that they have him on.

677
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:32,000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, the black shirt.

678
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
He's always wearing black on their god damn shows, kay?

679
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Johnny Cash?

680
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I don't...

681
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
He's dead!

682
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Dead!

683
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
The man in black is dead.

684
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Thank you.

685
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Whatever.

686
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Okay, I'm dead.

687
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Alright.

688
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Uh, yeah, so IKEA.

689
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
That was pretty much my week.

690
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
That's all I'm gonna say.

691
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Alright.

692
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,180
Well, you also watched Touch of Satan.

693
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,180
I did.

694
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,560
I watched Touch of Satan at the Mystery Science Theater thing, and that was...

695
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,560
The Touch of Satan one...

696
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:03,200
I don't know, like, I don't find Mystery Science Theater 3000, like, hilarious, like a lot

697
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:08,920
of my friends do, but I appreciate it, I respect it, I just don't laugh out loud a lot, but

698
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:13,200
that Touch of Satan, the bad thing is, is I was actually sitting there watching, you

699
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,120
know, the Mystery Science Theater thing, and I'm kind of going, you know, I'm kind of curious

700
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:22,040
what this movie is like without all the talking.

701
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,120
I don't know why, I think I just like bad movies.

702
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:27,960
I don't know why, some of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 movies are really funny, some

703
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:32,960
or not. This island earth can be yours if the price is right. And my other favorite

704
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:39,560
line in that one, my own private airfield. Which one is that from? The movie. And then

705
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:47,040
there's the one with the gunslinger, which is one of my favorites, with the female sheriff.

706
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,120
That one's really wrong. What was it, the touch of Satan, it had some wonderful lines

707
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:56,160
about like, they kept making references to walnut farming or something like that. And

708
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:01,640
like he's oh no my my prize walnut died or something like that because manos the hands

709
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:09,480
of fate where they showed the movie so awful that the doctor and the assistant both apologized

710
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:15,440
for making them watch it and then they came out in the robe with feet on it i have futos

711
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:21,720
no pedos that was it blink blink blink i'm lost that's right all right i have one more

712
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:25,720
little thing okay we watched the episode where they kept talking about waffles one night

713
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:30,380
when I lived in Alabama. I had waffles Saturday night. Lovely. I just wanted to share. My

714
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:35,560
friend and I wanted waffles so bad after watching this episode that we ran to the Super Walmart,

715
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:41,600
bought waffles, and came back and ate a whole box of waffles. Okay, once again at Walmart.

716
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:47,400
At Walmart. Hey, as in Alabama though, we did not have Target then. Alright. Yeah, we're

717
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:51,120
gonna go, well we're gonna go to a break and then we'll go get them. Well, not a full break

718
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:55,560
though, we're just gonna do one song real quick because the chat room requested this,

719
00:45:55,560 --> 00:46:01,640
Because it is Father's Day, so Happy Father's Day to all the fathers out there listening.

720
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:05,880
I don't know if we have any fathers that listen to this show, but if we do, hi, and Happy

721
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,720
Father's Day to you.

722
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,480
Did you guys do anything special today?

723
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,600
I forgot to call my daddy, but my daddy lives in a trailer by Lake Eufaula now.

724
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,600
Oh, okay.

725
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,440
I went and saw Batman Begins with my dad.

726
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,440
How was that?

727
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,480
It was good, actually.

728
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,120
Best Batman ever.

729
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,120
Best Batman ever?

00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,500

763

we have uh... now somebody who hasn't been on the show a whole lot but we have my

764
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:28,740
roommate here hi hello how are you

765
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:31,500
I'm doing well. How are you? Do you have a stage name you want to use?

766
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:36,380
Um, Extifer. Extifer. Okay, Extifer.

767
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:40,060
Extifer, you used to work at Walmart, correct?

768
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:43,900
I did. I used to work at Walmart. This is true. Right. Okay, so we've been talking about

769
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,340
Walmart tonight and just

770
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:49,660
we were talking during the show about, um, what was it, Jamie, you said you said you didn't want to

771
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:53,580
old up, or end up like an old woman who weighs... I don't want to be one of those middle-aged,

772
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:56,060
300-pound women in a moo-moo with five chillins.

773
00:48:56,060 --> 00:49:03,060
Momma, I want me a new Barbie. Momma, get me some chicken.

774
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:09,060
And so it had me thinking, well we should be asking Xtaphir about the funny people that show up at Walmart.

775
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:14,060
So do you have any interesting like 400 pound women that buy like thongpanny stories or anything?

776
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:24,060
We, I don't have like any 400 pound women buying thong stories, but like I had a bunch of like guys by the,

777
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:27,900
like Walmart used to have this like promotion or something like that

778
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:31,460
like that had to do with thong underwear and they were like stripper thong

779
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:32,140
underwear

780
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:36,200
like the flashy kind and like a bunch of... Wait, you're talking about guy

781
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,380
thong underwear? Yeah, guy thong underwear. Okay.

782
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:43,260
And like a bunch of like heavyset

783
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:46,820
like latino guys like came through my line like one time

784
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:50,180
and bought a bunch of them and I just thought it was kinda weird.

785
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:53,700
Is that all they bought? Yeah, it was actually.

786
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:56,820
You know what else would have been funny if they'd bought like all those thongs and a

787
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:59,780
jar of mayonnaise or something? Just to kind of throw you?

788
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:04,100
I don't remember any mayonnaise, but the thongs were still funny.

789
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:09,660
Wait, so they were buying, like there were how many of them?

790
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:14,580
I don't remember off the top of my head, but maybe like three or four probably.

791
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:18,060
And then they were buying like just ten? They bought them together, that's the funny

792
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:23,900
about it is I mean I don't know like if you're gonna buy some thong underwear I

793
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:29,820
guess invite your friends maybe it was less embarrassing to buy together I

794
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:33,740
don't know well now what is what is the policy on that see obviously you can't

795
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:37,380
point and laugh at them and go haha you're buying underwear oh I have I have

796
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:42,020
a good poker face so I'm just like you know I just ran through and let yeah

797
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:46,560
then had my laughs afterwards in the break room so you know like as you're

798
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,520
grabbing the underwear and putting it on the scanner, are you thinking, this is going to

799
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,960
be touching some fat guy's balls pretty soon?

800
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:55,200
Actually, I do think that.

801
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,200
But I'm just glad that it hasn't yet.

802
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,240
Anyhow.

803
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:05,000
Any other wonderful, glorious Walmart stories you want to share?

804
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,600
If I do come up with any, I'll let you know.

805
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,600
All right.

806
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:09,600
Sounds good.

807
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,600
Thank you.

808
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,280
We should make this a regular segment where you come tell us a funny Walmart story.

809
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,440
So you get to work on next week's edition.

810
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,440
Or we're not here next week.

811
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,440
You have two weeks to come up with another one. That's a lot of time.

812
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,440
Alright, you do that.

813
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,440
Alright, you do that.

814
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,440
Thank you. Extra firm.

815
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,440
Poor bastard has his house taken over every Sunday by us.

816
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,440
How would you like that?

817
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:33,440
Well, I have an offer. Open.

818
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,440
Oh, that's true, huh? Yeah.

819
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,440
Yeah, if you don't mind going out to the boonies at Citrus Heights.

820
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,440
I used to live in the boonies at Citrus Heights.

821
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,440
Well, not really the boonies, but...

822
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,440
Not really the boonies. It's a nice neighborhood.

823
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,440
Okay.

824
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,440
Yeah, it's a nice little...

825
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,440
I think I know which area you're going to...

826
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,440
I'm going to have a yard!

827
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:51,960
Dude, you're going to have to water a yard, or do that, you're going to have to water

828
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:52,960
a yard?

829
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,480
I'm... shit, no, Dan's job.

830
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,960
My parents are going on vacation, they want me to come over and water.

831
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:02,720
What's this manual labor stuff?

832
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,720
Alright.

833
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:10,040
Uh, let's talk about some actual DDR, Bamani-ish news, things going on.

834
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:15,080
Loki, this is interesting because no other website is running this story except for us,

835
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:19,160
so I'm assuming this is something you actually found out through your own means, but you're

836
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:22,640
talking about release dates for some of the new games.

837
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:29,240
Yeah, it's a perk of being in the video game sales business, so I have the two initial

838
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:35,880
street dates straight from Konami of when the new games will be coming out, and the

839
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:40,440
The first one being September 28th, I want to say, for DDR Extreme.

840
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:45,720
According to our website, our own website, orangehonestrainer.com, DDR Extreme 2 is going

841
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:54,360
to be out September 28th, 2005, and DDR UltraMix 3, November 2nd, 2005.

842
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,360
That's correct.

843
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,880
Election Day, right?

844
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:58,880
First Tuesday?

845
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,320
I don't vote.

846
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:04,480
Thank you for ruining America.

847
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:09,480
So define what initial street date means. Does this mean it's already solid or what?

848
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:14,480
Let me give you an idea of how solid game street dates are. There's this game called

849
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:19,480
Psychonauts. That's right, Psychonauts. It came out on the Xbox not too long ago. It's

850
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:23,080
supposed to be coming out for the PlayStation 2. This was back in May. It got pushed to

851
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:27,960
June. Then it got pushed to July. Then it went back to June. Back to July, then back

852
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:34,500
to June and it finally came out in June but so it depends certain companies

853
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:39,660
they'll move the dates around a little bit it being about you know a ways away

854
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:43,940
date wise you know three months away it's possible it can move I don't think

855
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:46,920
it will I'd be just because Konami is pretty good on their dates other

856
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:53,100
companies like EA and I don't know um Rockstar and anybody that's owned by

857
00:53:53,100 --> 00:54:00,380
jack-of-all-games, their dates are all fucked up. All over the place. But, yeah, so basically

858
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:04,100
I think that's probably pretty solid, just because the other two games before came out

859
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:06,980
around the same time, so it makes sense, you know.

860
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:10,100
Interesting. I tried it, and Seagrid left the room, but I...

861
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:13,300
Well, I'll let you know, like, as we're getting closer, when they're coming out, because I

862
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:17,940
am the one that actually keeps track of our date changes in our system, so...

863
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:21,500
That's cool. Good. So you're taking it to OrangeLaundry.com. Love it, love it.

864
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:22,500
Yeah.

865
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:25,500
And then, Karaoke Revolution Party Edition. I know that's coming out too.

866
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:29,500
Oh, and also the bundle I think is going to be $69, I think.

867
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,500
What bundle?

868
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:36,500
For, um, it's UltraMix III, I think, is their bundle. $69 retail.

869
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:39,500
I hear the Xbox pad's really good. I've never played with one.

870
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:44,500
But I still use my Red Octane Ignition because it hasn't broke yet, so it serves me well.

871
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:47,500
And I know Taiko No Tatujin 2's coming out at some point.

872
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:48,500
Really? Or you mean Taiko Drum Master?

873
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:49,500
Whatever.

874
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:53,500
I don't know. You gotta post more about the other games, too, not just the two.

875
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,500
I try. I'm like trying to keep track of...

876
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:59,500
Literally, there's a date change every day of the goddamn week.

877
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:06,500
Seriously, there's all these games that don't exist that our Dallas people are saying that do exist,

878
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:10,500
and I tell them that they're not, and then they're wrong, and yeah.

879
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:18,500
Anyway, these dates should really come as no surprise, because it's always been kind of assumed

880
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:22,100
both games are coming out in the fall and honestly we kind of have a pattern going here

881
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:29,340
now from the past two years and you know we usually get extreme September-ish and we get

882
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:34,420
the UltraMix games November-ish so this really isn't a surprise at all that these dates are

883
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:35,420
the way they are.

884
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:38,160
Although one is really close to the end of month and one is really close to the beginning.

885
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:42,500
I don't remember the games coming out so close together because they're only about four weeks

886
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:47,420
apart at this point and I think previously we've had like seven or eight weeks in between

887
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:52,100
indie games, so that's one thing. Well, it's really like, you know, as far as the release

888
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:55,900
schedule or whatever. Seegard, you're back. Now, I don't know what you can tell me and

889
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:59,700
can't tell me about NDAs. We're talking about the release dates for Extreme 2 and Ultra

890
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:08,700
Mix 3. Are they close? Or what? What do you know? I honestly know nothing about the release

891
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:15,740
dates, except what online retail sites are saying, and usually you can trust those if

892
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:22,060
If it's not Red Octane putting out the game, sorry, but let's face it, you pushed back

893
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:23,060
three times.

894
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:26,980
If it's not in the groove, it usually has a pretty good release date, and if they report

895
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:32,340
on it, they usually get that from the company, but I haven't seen any official things in

896
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:33,340
the office.

897
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:37,460
It's kind of weird that he would find out before you, but I guess that's the way it

898
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:38,460
goes.

899
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:39,780
Well, he doesn't deal with the sales end of it.

900
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:47,780
We've also gotten GameStop has most of them too, so I'd just ask Dan if everyone would know anything.

901
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,780
They're all in the same mailing list.

902
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:53,780
What I want to know is when are those vrares, assuming that both are going to have a vrare again,

903
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:57,780
I don't see why they wouldn't because I think people like those and Konami likes it when people like things.

904
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:02,780
Assuming we're getting new vrares, I'm not going to bother asking Seeker because he'll just tell me NDA,

905
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:06,780
but assuming we're getting new vrares, the question is when will those come out?

906
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:09,780
Do we get them maybe before, with a pre-order, or are we just going to get them the day of the game?

907
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:14,780
Well, you know, maybe we can get some hookups with those people from Konami of Japan checking on our show.

908
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:23,780
We were perusing our website statistic logs for another project, and we were looking at some of the domains that have been visiting us,

909
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:29,780
and we were kind of happy with some of the ones we saw. So, hi to our friends at Konami of Japan who listen secretly to our show.

910
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,780
What time is it there?

911
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:35,620
Like I don't think they listen to the live show, but I think they're there on the site

912
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:41,060
Well, they're definitely I was listening to the repeat depending on the time of day. Yes, the DER

913
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:43,500
comb on why

914
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:46,740
That's time of day. I don't know. I'm trying to think what time of day it would be that the show repeats

915
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:54,280
Yes, the DER freak radio rewind every Friday night at six o'clock six or seven check ddrfreak.com for the details

916
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:56,660
Friday nights over on ddrfreak.com

917
00:57:56,660 --> 00:58:05,980
All right, so there's your release dates for the new games. I think we'll do, we'll

918
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:09,220
actually go to a longer break right now and when we come back from this break we

919
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:12,380
got a brand new UltraMix 3 song to play for you guys and we want to talk

920
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:20,900
about this story. Pump It Up and In The Groove Are Joining Forces and yes we

921
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:25,340
already knew this in some capacity but I was quite surprised with the news I

922
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:27,820
heard this week so I'm really curious to see what you guys have to say about

923
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:33,820
Skypline will be open as well at some point when we come back so let's go to a

924
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:37,220
break and we'll come back so in this break I think we'll hear some since we

925
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:40,500
didn't last break we did some DDR songs we haven't heard in a while and this

926
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:44,940
break we'll do like some 2dx songs we haven't heard in a while so we're gonna

927
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:51,100
start it off with let's see I don't know what am I in the mood to hear let's hear

928
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:58,100
We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

929
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:24,700
We are your actors, everything's gonna be alright

930
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:29,700
I want to make a move for you, can't fake it now

931
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:34,700
I can't fake it now, I can't fake it, can't fake it, leave me all night

932
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:40,700
Yeah, every day, everywhere, I don't even wanna tell

933
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:42,700
Can't kite since then

Let's make it, let's go

942
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:11,700
I just wanna make it so I can stay

943
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:13,700
This is what it is all about

944
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:15,700
I just want to make one little one

945
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:17,700
You can't make it now

946
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:19,700
I just can't make it now

947
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:21,700
I just can't make a difference

948
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:23,700
Right

949
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:35,700
And the beat. And the beat.

950
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:45,700
And the beat.

951
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:19,860
The

952
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:23,860
the

953
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:27,860
the

954
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:31,860
the

955
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:35,860
the

956
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:39,860
the

957
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:43,860
the

958
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:48,860
Mmm, mmm, mmm

959
01:04:48,860 --> 01:05:13,500
Just disturbed guys.

960
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:15,500
Just a disturbed guy.

962
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:18,460
might I add that Final Destination 2 is exactly the same movie as Final Destination 1 just

963
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:25,500
gorier. That is about it. It is exactly the same. How did her head get chopped off? She

964
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:30,580
was stuck in an elevator door and then, yeah, her head was stuck in an elevator door. I

965
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:35,220
don't know. The Final Destination movies were all these crazy death trap scenarios. It was

966
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:38,300
like mouse trap, you know? First the ball rolls down the stairs and it rolls down a

967
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:42,460
little tube and it sets off the guy who jumps off the bed. You know, all that crap. I love

968
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:47,460
That's like the Final Destination movies. It's like Mouse Trap the movie, except people die in hideous ways.

969
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:54,460
That'd be hilarious if there was a movie where the villain, like, his calling card was the Mouse Trap game, and then, like, the whole thing would set off a bomb at the end.

970
01:06:54,460 --> 01:07:01,460
The only problem with Mouse Trap, though, is that sometimes it didn't go off just right. You know, it gets stuck or something. So I guess that wouldn't work.

971
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:02,460
work.

972
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:07,480
Well anyway, I don't know, this guy with a hook got the chick's hair and then she ended

973
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:09,380
up getting stuck in the door because of it.

974
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:13,260
I don't know, whatever, and then it was like, ew blood, and then Extra First said something

975
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:14,740
about that all the...

976
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:18,120
I haven't seen Final Destination 2, I've only seen the first one, but he said something

977
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:21,300
about Kool-Aid, all the blood looks like Kool-Aid, just...

978
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:24,500
Yeah, there's a lot of CG blood in this one.

979
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:25,500
I see.

980
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:31,540
and gets killed by a giant like window falling on them and like flattens them

981
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:36,900
by the way if we're spoiling the movie for you good just don't bother watching

982
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:41,900
it actually the same fucking movie you know the first movie I don't want to

983
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:44,220
spend too much time talking about a series of movies it's over five years

984
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:48,380
old but when we went saw the first movie in the theater you remember that scene

985
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:52,900
where the chick gets hit by the bus my best friend at the time and I were

986
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:57,860
laughing and laughing and laughing and people were turning around in the

987
01:07:57,860 --> 01:08:01,540
theater looking at us going you insensitive bastards that girl just got

988
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:04,880
splattered all over the street and we're laughing and laughing cuz it's the way

989
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:14,300
that it happens she's all screws like here comes the bus in Jurassic Park 3

990
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:19,520
when they were pulling the people out of the field buffet buffet I haven't seen

991
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:24,040
Jurassic Park 3 because it just, you know, it was Jurassic Park 3, and I figured one

992
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:25,040
and two was the-

993
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,040
It was with the raptors.

994
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:27,040
Really?

995
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:32,920
They were, they were, these people were crossing the fields and the velociraptors were running

996
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:37,360
through this tall field, and just, you'd see little people, whoop, disappear, whoop, disappear,

997
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:40,760
and we were like, it's a buffet for the raptors.

998
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:44,360
See, for a second there, before she mentioned raptors, I thought it might have been like,

999
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:50,120
know, I don't know, maybe um, Rosie O'Donnell or something in the field that, she might

1000
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:55,920
have been like, you know, snatching people because, you never know.

1001
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:56,920
Thanks.

1002
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:58,040
Alright.

1003
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:03,440
Back to um, the gaming realm, which we talk about here on this show, brand new UltraMix

1004
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:04,880
3 news this week.

1005
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:08,620
Last week, we got to unveil this, because nobody else found this, we were the first

1006
01:09:08,620 --> 01:09:13,200
to find this, that Spray had actually announced on their website that they were going to have

1007
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:16,840
new song in Ultramix 3 called I Am Gothic and we played this song for you guys last

1008
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:29,840
night to which it sounds like most of you guys had a bit of an eh reception. I like

1009
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:33,360
the song. I know Seagrid likes the song but the rest of you guys are kind of eh. Here's

1010
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:40,360
Here's a little reminder of IAMGothic.

1011
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:48,480
So,

1012
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:53,800
now this has already previously been announced on DDR Freaks in the

1013
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:57,200
official UltraMix 3 thread. We don't get to be the first to tell you about this because we didn't

1014
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:58,400
find this, somebody else did.

1015
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:02,400
A user here by the name of Rockus,

1016
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:05,920
who I think is also one of our listeners, so you go boy,

1017
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:06,760
found this one.

1018
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:10,200
And it's actually a link to a magazine website,

1019
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:13,440
Virus Magazine, which I think has to do

1020
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,240
with like industrial music.

1021
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:19,220
And sure enough, another band has themselves said

1022
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:21,260
that they have a song in UltraMix 3,

1023
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:23,660
and it's a band called the Azoic.

1024
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:26,300
The Azoic used to be on different drum,

1025
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:27,700
and I don't think they're on there anymore,

1026
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:29,420
but they used to be on different drum.

1027
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:31,260
And I think it's kind of neat that the Azoic

1028
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:35,460
moving over into DDR because I actually bought the Ozoic's last album of which

1029
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:41,380
this song a remix of the song is on so I think that's kind of neat based off of

1030
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:44,260
samples I heard on a different drum when Ultramix 2 got popular so I'm kind of

1031
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:48,740
excited about that anyway the song is called conflict and it's the turmoil

1032
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:53,260
mix and then the rest of the article talks about how the Ozoic.com has been

1033
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:56,740
down lately but at least we get to find out a new song so hey I'm liking this

1034
01:10:56,740 --> 01:11:00,660
trend since Sigurd won't tell us anything about the song list just

1035
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:04,240
kidding I know you're under contract or whatever the artists themselves are

1036
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:07,600
starting to spill the beans about the song so now we have another confirmed

1037
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:12,600
song thanks to a band with a big mouth the Azoic and Conflict so we're gonna

1038
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:17,340
hear the song you guys ready yes as we got it here on Orange Lounge Radio

1039
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:21,320
because that's what we do we find songs and we play them for you yep so here is

1040
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:27,000
a brand new song from DDR Ultra Mix 3 the band is called the Azoic and this is

1041
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Conflict, the Turmoil Mix, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1042
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Oh

1043
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:05,000
You're the only one here that knows the world that you live in

1044
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:12,000
You know I see the light inside my face, I let you rise

1045
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:18,000
You'll come and I will be with you until the sun gets gray

1046
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:25,000
I know you know I'll be with you until the sun gets gray

1047
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Keep walking, keep walking for me

1048
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Walk this one, you'll be the way

1049
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
You'll be here as the world

1050
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Walk, walk, walk, here as the one thing it can

1051
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:13,000
And I'll walk to your view on the sand

1052
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:18,000
I never knew what to be

1053
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Oh

1054
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,500
Go away from you, please don't play

1055
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:54,500
You'll be here at home now

1056
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:57,500
Go home, go clear at home

1057
01:15:57,500 --> 01:16:00,000
Take your time and go

1058
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,000
On to your new home now

1059
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:07,000
And I never knew what to do

1060
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
If I be a king

1061
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:45,200
Orange Lawn's radio premiere there of Conflict, the turmoil mix.

1062
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:50,260
Coming up from DDR, UltraMix III is going to be the game that has that song in it.

1063
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:54,260
And that was announced by the band, or at least a magazine on behalf of the band.

1064
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:55,900
I don't know how that works there.

1065
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:58,540
But the beans were spilled, and there it is.

1066
01:16:58,540 --> 01:17:00,380
That song's going to be in UltraMix III.

1067
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:01,000
What do you guys think?

1068
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:04,900
Now keep in mind, the song there clocks in at 5 and 1 half minutes,

1069
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:08,180
but they edit these songs down to a minute and a half, two minute range.

1070
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:09,620
You'll get like a verse and a chorus.

1071
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:10,300
What do you think?

1072
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:13,020
sounds like the stuff that they play at Rapture. It's pretty cool.

1073
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:17,140
Yeah, you know, I think it's kind of ironic that we got last week the I Am

1074
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:19,460
Gothic song, which is a little tongue-in-cheek.

1075
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:23,260
It wasn't really a goth song, but it wasn't really, like, anti-goth. It was just a tongue-in-cheek.

1076
01:17:23,260 --> 01:17:27,300
Like, it was a weird owl of goth, I think, to me. It's kinda

1077
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:31,020
synth-pop, I don't know. In a way, in a way.

1078
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:34,860
We get that song last week, and now we get this this week. So they actually play it

1079
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:39,180
the the we get like an actual like industrial goth

1080
01:17:39,180 --> 01:17:42,140
kinda sounding song that you would hear at a club. It was cool, I like it.

1081
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:46,380
Uh, Loki. Are they like suffering or lacking in the goth demographic

1082
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:50,220
as for DDR or something? Because this is what it seems like. It's like,

1083
01:17:50,220 --> 01:17:53,900
how can we, you know, get those goths to play a

1084
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:59,820
pop dance game? Let's put some some sad music in there. No, I, I don't know. It's

1085
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:03,820
just, it's okay, I guess. But let's just, hopefully

1086
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:07,900
the next few artists that announce that their songs are going to be in there will be a little

1087
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:10,620
something different than, say, I don't know, goth music.

1088
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:14,540
Well, now, you know, I'm sure they're going to have a variety of music, as they always

1089
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:18,220
do, and Konami's not the one releasing this information either. It's coming from the artists

1090
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:24,060
themselves, so maybe the gothic bands are just excited about DDR. I don't know. I don't

1091
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:25,860
know what to say about that, so.

1092
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:28,780
Well, whatever. I mean, it's just...

1093
01:18:28,780 --> 01:18:29,780
It's okay.

1094
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:32,220
I didn't really care for that song too much, actually.

1095
01:18:32,220 --> 01:18:34,820
Seegerd, what do you think of the Ozoic?

1096
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:36,980
I really, really, really like that song.

1097
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:43,700
And it got stuck in my head for about a week when I had heard it previously.

1098
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:45,660
But yeah, it's a good song.

1099
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:46,160
I like it.

1100
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:49,020
I'm glad it's in the game.

1101
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:52,420
Me personally, I'm thrilled that that song made the game.

1102
01:18:52,420 --> 01:18:54,980
I think it's kind of weird because it's interesting

1103
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:58,020
as I'm looking at the chat room reaction.

1104
01:18:58,020 --> 01:19:00,460
And a lot of folks are saying, I'm liking this.

1105
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:01,140
Me likey.

1106
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:06,180
it's a very upbeat kind of song. I like this, Arcadian42 says I hate myself and I

1107
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:17,660
want to DDR. It's kind of a sad song to me it's a very

1108
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:21,860
like kind of downbeat although it is upbeat dancy it's definitely a song that

1109
01:19:21,860 --> 01:19:26,780
will work for DDR it's it's kind of depressing in a way to me so and then I

1110
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:31,740
I think about UltraMix 3's theme and all the happy bubble water theme and the, you

1111
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:37,500
know, yeah it's DDR with all these happy characters, and I'm like, I love goth music and DDR, I'm

1112
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:45,020
gonna go drown myself now. I don't know, it's kind of, just interesting, so. I'm sure not

1113
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:49,700
every song is gonna be a goth song, I think it's just, just a coincidence. We need DDR

1114
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:58,620
mix. I would so, like, buy that. I'm so gothic that I play DDR in Bach mode. Dude,

1115
01:19:58,620 --> 01:20:06,940
DDR UltraMix just goth served us. Alright, so we'll see what artist spills the

1116
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:13,060
beans next. My advice, this is what we've had now, one, two folks from that are

1117
01:20:13,060 --> 01:20:18,380
somehow related to a different drum, even though maybe directly or not, keep an eye

1118
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:24,540
on the websites for these guys. Don't forget that Midihead is also related to a different

1119
01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:27,300
drum. And Midihead is on a different drum, and we already know that Raise Your Hands

1120
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:31,060
is going to be in there. We played that a few weeks ago. So, also kind of a, not so

1121
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:38,220
much a goth song, but an industrial-ish song. So, kind of interesting. My advice, keep an

1122
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:41,880
eye on those websites, those different drum artists, because one of them is bound to spill

1123
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:47,260
the beans next. I don't think three is, it seems like last time we had more than three

1124
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:50,500
different drum licenses so I'm thinking there's got to be at least at least a

1125
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:56,460
couple more so we'll see all right I like this now the chat room is going off

1126
01:20:56,460 --> 01:21:05,080
on this every time you conform you lose a bar interesting all right um moving

1127
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:11,140
on let's talk about some other big news that's going on in the scene right now

1128
01:21:11,140 --> 01:21:15,340
actually what happened this week is that and the Miro or no I'm sorry rocks or

1129
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:18,980
put out this press release maybe it was a joint release with Andamiro I don't

1130
01:21:18,980 --> 01:21:24,160
know but it's actually a post that's on rock source forums rock shore games is

01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:54,320
blah stereo system, blah blah blah 130 songs, blah blah blah all the songs from

1137
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:58,600
the original In the Groove, blah blah blah cooperation from Roxor and Anamiro,

1138
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:04,120
blah blah blah 1,100 dance routines because of all these songs, blah blah

1139
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:09,140
blah, you know, singles doubles and all that, you add it up it adds up quick, blah

1140
01:22:09,140 --> 01:22:13,220
blah blah Pump it Up In the Groove 2 is now available from game distributors

1141
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:17,620
nationwide so that was a little bit of a surprise no surprise there that

1142
01:22:17,620 --> 01:22:20,580
annamiro and rockstar are going to be working together we already knew annamiro

1143
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:25,100
was helping in the cabinets in some capacity but now in the groove is part

1144
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:31,980
of the pump it up series weird not really not really what do you think it's

1145
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:35,900
just a name it's just going to be on probably the cabinets and stuff and it's

1146
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:39,380
also they probably won the pump it up thing in there so they can steal that

1147
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:43,740
rolling freezes or freeze rolls or whatever because you know they needed

1148
01:22:43,740 --> 01:22:49,500
another gimmick I've seen some posts about what is a freeze roll and I don't

1149
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:54,460
remember where I read this but I do know I read it into what is the freeze roll

1150
01:22:54,460 --> 01:22:58,580
a freeze roll which is this new thing they're putting in in the groove to I'm

1151
01:22:58,580 --> 01:23:04,300
sorry pump it up in the groove to is instead of holding like a freeze arrow

1152
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:08,340
you hold your foot down the freeze roll is you have to tap your foot repeatedly

1153
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:13,180
like think about paranoia survivor heavy I think it was was it no no was it

1154
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:17,420
paranoia survivor what's no no no no no no no no no I'm thinking I can't stop

1155
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:22,500
falling in love is one what was the one in fifth mix the remarried a eternal yes

1156
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:27,580
paranoid eternal remember like there's one part of it we have to go it's like

1157
01:23:27,580 --> 01:23:31,340
all the same like it's a down arrow or left arrow or something that's what a

1158
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:35,860
freeze roll is which will kill your foot faster than anything else so I'm like

1159
01:23:35,860 --> 01:23:40,580
hooray it's another thing to hurt myself on in the group sorry pump it up in the

1160
01:23:40,580 --> 01:23:41,780
group

1161
01:23:41,780 --> 01:23:46,540
well what i remember from pump it up because they have that actually in there

1162
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:50,020
is the more you hit at the more point you get

1163
01:23:50,020 --> 01:23:53,380
during that for ok well that's kinda like uh... like a note

1164
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:56,520
catches it out there so i'm like that i could attach it in the more you hit or

1165
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:59,760
don't you know i'm going to have more you hit during one of those roles more

1166
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:03,540
point you get i think that's well that's not as bad benefits and then senate

1167
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:07,820
I think that's what it is, but it's still retarded. Whatever. I mean, it's...

1168
01:24:07,820 --> 01:24:12,860
I'm not gonna go, oh, that game was freeze-rolled, I gotta go play it right now.

1169
01:24:12,860 --> 01:24:13,500
No.

1170
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,540
It's okay. I mean,

1171
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:17,620
okay, they want a new idea.

1172
01:24:17,620 --> 01:24:21,620
Here you go. It's a new idea. Whatever. I'm glad though they have the nice

1173
01:24:21,620 --> 01:24:27,440
widescreen monitor to show off those really bland graphics in a really large, you know, size.

1174
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:31,740
Because, you know, a game like that just really needs the extra monitor space and

1175
01:24:31,740 --> 01:24:36,580
resolution because, you know, before it couldn't quite show off the bland graphics that were

1176
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:37,580
in it.

1177
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:42,300
Well, now, now, in the press release under In the Groove 2, I'm sorry, pump it up, In

1178
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:47,860
the Groove 2, under the new features, all new graphics, featuring new In the Groove

1179
01:24:47,860 --> 01:24:48,860
characters.

1180
01:24:48,860 --> 01:24:50,260
Oh wow, they're going to be bland too?

1181
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:56,500
You know, all new graphics meaning, we made it red, that's what it is, we made it red,

1182
01:24:56,500 --> 01:25:00,780
all new graphics, featuring In the Groove characters.

1183
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:05,780
Where have I seen dancing characters before? Where did I see that?

1184
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:09,780
Maybe it was in Maniac Mansion.

1185
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:11,780
That's right, it was Maniac Mansion.

1186
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:13,780
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1187
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:17,780
It was the Jungle Beat game. The Jungle Book, Jungle Beat game.

1188
01:25:17,780 --> 01:25:19,780
Yeah, they did kind of box out.

1189
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:20,780
Because they had the characters.

1190
01:25:20,780 --> 01:25:23,780
Nowhere else have they seen dancing characters before and they make custom characters.

1191
01:25:23,780 --> 01:25:28,780
In this game, it's actually a DDR sim. It's called StepMania.

1192
01:25:28,780 --> 01:25:35,020
Yeah, in which this game is in no way based on at all.

1193
01:25:35,020 --> 01:25:37,180
Speaking of which, I got a funny story about that later.

1194
01:25:37,180 --> 01:25:39,260
OK.

1195
01:25:39,260 --> 01:25:42,060
Let's see, unlockable songs and expert steps.

1196
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:45,100
Greatly expanded compatibility for USB memory cards.

1197
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:47,660
I think I was reading somewhere where the USB will now

1198
01:25:47,660 --> 01:25:51,260
not only download your scores, but the whole damn arcade

1199
01:25:51,260 --> 01:25:55,420
high scores will go on your USB card, which is interesting,

1200
01:25:55,420 --> 01:25:56,220
I guess.

1201
01:25:56,220 --> 01:26:01,020
I think they're trying to formulate this way of doing like a national ranking, which, you

1202
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:03,940
know what, one thing I really like about In The Groove and I give them a lot of credit

1203
01:26:03,940 --> 01:26:07,940
for it, the USB support is phenomenal and I wish DDR had something like it.

1204
01:26:07,940 --> 01:26:12,020
So I'll give them that and I'm interested to see how they expand on the USB support.

1205
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:14,860
So that's exciting news to me.

1206
01:26:14,860 --> 01:26:19,780
Novice difficulty with helpers like Traffic Light and Constant Scroll to assist players

1207
01:26:19,780 --> 01:26:22,260
who are just getting started.

1208
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:24,380
I have no idea what that means, but okay.

1209
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:34,460
light that sounds interesting let's see 65 new songs this is one other thing I

1210
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:40,100
like about in the groove vs. DDR because how many times has your DDR machine been

1211
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:45,800
reset at the local arcade and you cannot get the stupid arcade operator to put in

1212
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:50,300
the code to unlock stoic and all that stuff because you know they they do an

1213
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:53,840
outside vending company or something so nobody will open the machine even if you

1214
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:56,840
know the code, you can't put it in. Well, one thing I like about what In The Groove

1215
01:26:56,840 --> 01:27:02,560
does and Pump It Up In The Groove 2 is going to continue is that the unlock codes are actually

1216
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:08,400
entered by the players via the dance pad. So I think that's good. Smart idea. So that's

1217
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:13,280
coming back and all that stuff that you've come to know and love or whatever about In

1218
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:16,280
The Groove. Loki, any more hateful thoughts?

1219
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:22,600
Well, I got something that's not exactly... It's In The Groove news, but it's not related

1220
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:25,000
to this particular Indigroov news.

1221
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,800
Okay, well try me.

1222
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:29,080
Okay, well it was basically

1223
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:32,040
Indigroov was saying,

1224
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:33,680
our encryption is

1225
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:36,760
kick-ass and no one will be able to defeat it, yada yada yada.

1226
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:39,640
Well actually, no it was not.

1227
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:42,980
Because as soon as the game came out

1228
01:27:42,980 --> 01:27:46,320
for the U.S.

1229
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:47,720
for the Playstation 2,

1230
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:52,520
the entire theme, all the movies, and all the music, and all the steps, and

1231
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:57,840
everything else were ripped almost instantly because, guess what, and this is going to

1232
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:03,760
be a shocker, it's basically step mania. It's basically step mania. So everything was able

1233
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:09,960
to be ripped almost, like, without effort and thrown into step mania. So you can get

1234
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:14,040
that off your local BitTorrent site. I don't know if it's so much that as the fact as when

1235
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:20,080
people say, we have a great encryption scheme that nobody will be able to hack, that is

1236
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:25,840
inviting people to come in and hack it. I can think of examples that have nothing to

1237
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:31,580
do with video games, such as the CD companies, like Sony and stuff, when they said, oh, we're

1238
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:36,380
going to put out these copy protected CDs, and you will not be able to copy these CDs

1239
01:28:36,380 --> 01:28:40,380
no matter what you do, because it launches a program when you put the CD in, and you

1240
01:28:40,380 --> 01:28:45,180
can't copy the CDs. Well, here's the magic work around that somebody found. Get this.

1241
01:28:45,180 --> 01:28:49,360
hold the shift key when you put in the CD to abort the autorun feature

1242
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:51,540
copy protection aborted

1243
01:28:51,540 --> 01:28:52,900
so okay

1244
01:28:52,900 --> 01:28:55,220
when somebody says that we cannot be hacked

1245
01:28:55,220 --> 01:28:56,540
that is just an invite

1246
01:28:56,540 --> 01:28:58,700
to somebody to hack them

1247
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:01,580
I have to laugh because basically here's what

1248
01:29:01,580 --> 01:29:03,540
it's basically uh... and

1249
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:07,580
and normally when people release you know like themes and stuff it's like okay

1250
01:29:07,580 --> 01:29:10,140
you know hey the fans wanted to go play this and stuff

1251
01:29:10,140 --> 01:29:13,660
well this is just spiteful stuff basically here's

1252
01:29:13,660 --> 01:29:19,860
Here's a little info file that's included with your local Bittorrent version of their theme.

1253
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:21,660
It'd be, yes, we've done it.

1254
01:29:21,660 --> 01:29:25,180
We've done what those rocks or bastards claim to be impossible.

1255
01:29:25,180 --> 01:29:31,300
Again, we have cracked the encryption, end quotes, that houses the game's files using

1256
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:34,500
tools made in-house by our cracking experts.

1257
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:38,860
Since In the Groove is just a rip-off of StepMania, the files were easily portable

1258
01:29:38,860 --> 01:29:40,660
to the StepMania layout.

1259
01:29:40,660 --> 01:29:45,460
This smzip file contains songs, supporting graphics,

1260
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:47,780
for use in Samania.

1261
01:29:47,780 --> 01:29:49,540
Well, now I'm sure a lot of In the Groove fans

1262
01:29:49,540 --> 01:29:51,200
are going rabble, rabble, rabble at that.

1263
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:54,060
But you know, that's just some kid showing off their internet

1264
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:55,300
penis because they cracked it.

1265
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:56,000
Hooray for you.

1266
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:56,500
Good job.

1267
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:57,900
Whatever.

1268
01:29:57,900 --> 01:30:00,500
Don't take it too personally.

1269
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:01,740
That type of stuff.

1270
01:30:01,740 --> 01:30:02,940
It's quite funny.

1271
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:07,300
But basically, you can actually see some rips here

1272
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:09,820
on itgfreak.com.

1273
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:16,820
appropriate that they'd be on there, and they're pretty much perfect, granted there's some

1274
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:23,180
little tweaks. Are the loading times improved when you played in StepMania? I guess. And

1275
01:30:23,180 --> 01:30:29,140
what was up with the whole, I don't know, in the groove of corrupting your save file

1276
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:33,540
or something like that? I'm surprised that this game was so polished, I mean, I would

1277
01:30:33,540 --> 01:30:38,220
expect something from such a game that, you know... Now, now, now, somebody could just

1278
01:30:38,220 --> 01:30:42,180
come up just as easily and say, you're just picking on him now, because somebody could

1279
01:30:42,180 --> 01:30:47,100
easily come up and say, whoa, in DDR Extreme they have a whole song that was supposed to

1280
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:51,300
be unlocked that you can't get, da da da, you know, the memories debacle, whatever.

1281
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:55,420
No, that was basically, you know, cut out the game, but some of the stuff is still in

1282
01:30:55,420 --> 01:31:01,140
the code. That's not, my save file gets erased because that song is not in the game.

1283
01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:04,260
Okay, okay, I'll give you that. There's a slight difference there. There is.

1284
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:06,460
uh... i'm sorry i mean

1285
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:09,980
but you you're picking on it but you're picking on it looks like something that

1286
01:31:09,980 --> 01:31:13,260
some would make home brew for the dream cat to me this is what it looks like

1287
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:14,260
this game

1288
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:18,380
is just crap i'm sorry i know that we're at work we got enough hate mail last

1289
01:31:18,380 --> 01:31:18,980
week

1290
01:31:18,980 --> 01:31:20,200
cyrd what do you

1291
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:21,700
what do you think of

1292
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:22,940
pop it up

1293
01:31:22,940 --> 01:31:27,640
in the group to and i'll say it for you what secret says does not reflect in any

1294
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:31,440
way shape or form konami data that it uh... and very angry about it

1295
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:33,900
because as everybody should know by now

1296
01:31:33,900 --> 01:31:34,980
um...

1297
01:31:34,980 --> 01:31:38,200
maybe they don't i'm a huge fan of pump it up

1298
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:41,100
like half of me is dedicated to konami but

1299
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:45,420
the other half is all for pump it up and everything to do with pump it up

1300
01:31:45,420 --> 01:31:49,300
and so when i heard this i'd wanted to cry

1301
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:52,740
the half of me that loves pump it up could stay out of the konami versus rock

1302
01:31:52,740 --> 01:31:53,860
sore debate

1303
01:31:53,860 --> 01:31:57,340
and it could just go play pump it up but now it has to uh...

1304
01:31:57,340 --> 01:32:01,060
get involved because apparently and amira wanted to

1305
01:32:01,060 --> 01:32:06,180
get sued again by konami or vice versa or however that crappy lawsuit went

1306
01:32:06,180 --> 01:32:07,320
but um...

1307
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:08,740
yeah i don't like it

1308
01:32:08,740 --> 01:32:13,960
and i've even tried pump recently or not pump uh... in the group recently and

1309
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:16,580
and still very angry about all this

1310
01:32:16,580 --> 01:32:18,540
i played in the group today

1311
01:32:18,540 --> 01:32:20,520
so that i had a uh...

1312
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:21,060
it's

1313
01:32:21,060 --> 01:32:22,900
uh...

1314
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:24,620
well

1315
01:32:24,620 --> 01:32:26,300
oh yeah that was funny cuz

1316
01:32:26,300 --> 01:32:30,140
on my first song i got a i got a star because i got like a ninety six percent

1317
01:32:30,140 --> 01:32:35,140
or something and see yourself, you got a star! You can get a star in this game!

1318
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:37,140
And I'm like, dude, they let you work on DDR?

1319
01:32:37,140 --> 01:32:40,140
My DDR skills have seriously declined.

1320
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:44,140
But no, I think that's good. That goes to show that you don't have to be a DDR expert

1321
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:49,140
or whatever to play, you know, you don't have to be able to AAA everything in order to work on DDR.

1322
01:32:49,140 --> 01:32:52,140
I haven't really played DDR, like, for real in years.

1323
01:32:52,140 --> 01:32:59,140
So, it's amazing that I even got an A- or an S- or whatever that crappy letter thing they had on In the Groove was.

1324
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:03,460
Yeah, I'm just very bitter about this whole thing, and I don't want Pump It Up's name

1325
01:33:03,460 --> 01:33:08,140
attached to In The Groove, because I like Pump It Up, and I don't like In The Groove.

1326
01:33:08,140 --> 01:33:14,420
But I like In The Groove's songs, Land of the Rising Sun is cool, and The Roots, that's

1327
01:33:14,420 --> 01:33:15,420
about it.

1328
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:16,420
Yes, Loki.

1329
01:33:16,420 --> 01:33:17,420
Be good.

1330
01:33:17,420 --> 01:33:23,420
Why in the hell would Andamiro want to like, shame themselves, you know, by putting Pump

1331
01:33:23,420 --> 01:33:25,140
It Up in front of this game?

1332
01:33:25,140 --> 01:33:30,140
I mean, honestly, unless, unless, you know, the whole creative team behind Pump It Up

1333
01:33:30,140 --> 01:33:34,460
went and redesigned their whole interface and said, okay, yeah, we like what you did,

1334
01:33:34,460 --> 01:33:35,460
but we got a few...

1335
01:33:35,460 --> 01:33:36,460
No, no, no, no.

1336
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:38,380
Say what you wrote about the In The Groove interface.

1337
01:33:38,380 --> 01:33:40,420
Pumps is way worse.

1338
01:33:40,420 --> 01:33:42,420
Pump has one of the worst interfaces in the world.

1339
01:33:42,420 --> 01:33:43,500
That is a lie.

1340
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:44,500
That is a total truth.

1341
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:45,500
That is a lie.

1342
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:46,500
That is a total truth.

1343
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:47,500
Pump It Up has it great.

1344
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:48,500
I speak the truth.

1345
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:49,500
They have the songs...

1346
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:50,500
Get over it.

1347
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:52,660
They have the songs classified by channels, the Banya channel, the K-pop channel, and

1348
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:53,660
the pop channel.

1349
01:33:53,660 --> 01:33:54,860
You don't get much easier than that.

1350
01:33:54,860 --> 01:33:58,840
The only thing wrong with it is that you have to put all the codes in via your foot, and

1351
01:33:58,840 --> 01:33:59,840
that gets annoying.

1352
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:06,300
But also, when you're talking about In the Groove 2 having the codes with the feet to

1353
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:11,260
unlock the songs, Pump It Up does that too, so that's no surprise.

1354
01:34:11,260 --> 01:34:14,700
Which interface looks like it came out of my ass, and which one looks like it was actually

1355
01:34:14,700 --> 01:34:16,940
worked on by professional software teams?

1356
01:34:16,940 --> 01:34:18,020
I would beg to differ.

1357
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:20,100
I cannot stand Pump It Up's interface.

1358
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:21,100
I hate it.

1359
01:34:21,100 --> 01:34:22,100
It's horrible.

1360
01:34:22,100 --> 01:34:23,100
Okay, okay.

1361
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:24,780
Interface technicalities aside, I'm not talking about the

1362
01:34:24,780 --> 01:34:28,660
way the interface functions, just pure aesthetic value of it.

1363
01:34:28,660 --> 01:34:33,100
I want you to say, which game has run to you in it? Because that sells me right there,

1364
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:34,780
that's enough. Pump It Up doesn't anymore.

1365
01:34:34,780 --> 01:34:39,900
Oh, that's true. Damn them, neither. DarkStalker, you've been off very quiet over there, what

1366
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:44,460
do you think about this whole debacle? I'm not going to give any of them my business,

1367
01:34:44,460 --> 01:34:48,900
so that's all there is to it. I thought you liked Pump It Up.

1368
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:51,060
I liked it before they followed their name.

1369
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:52,540
Ooh!

1370
01:34:52,540 --> 01:34:56,140
Oh, snap! I think that kind of gives her opinion right there.

1371
01:34:56,140 --> 01:35:00,180
This would be like, you know, putting, you know, Dance Dance Revolution's George Foreman

1372
01:35:00,180 --> 01:35:03,740
Grill. I mean, there's really no point in doing that.

1373
01:35:03,740 --> 01:35:05,660
Now,

1374
01:35:05,660 --> 01:35:09,500
hold on a minute, because I'm actually going to think this out here, okay? Just be careful, there might

1375
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:11,500
be steam that arises from my head or something.

1376
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:13,260
Now, let's see.

1377
01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:15,660
I have a dancing game.

1378
01:35:15,660 --> 01:35:17,420
I'm Andy Mero, and I have a dancing game.

1379
01:35:17,420 --> 01:35:20,700
And it's not catching on the same way that my competitor's

1380
01:35:20,700 --> 01:35:22,860
dancing game is catching on.

1381
01:35:22,860 --> 01:35:25,520
OK, now wait for a minute.

1382
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:30,140
I am another company who borrowed heavily a lot of

1383
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:33,060
ideas from the competitor and put it into its own game and

1384
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:34,540
tried to improve upon it.

1385
01:35:34,540 --> 01:35:35,820
And now I'm getting sued.

1386
01:35:35,820 --> 01:35:36,940
So here we are.

1387
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:39,780
We've got the number one, the king of dance games, Konami.

1388
01:35:39,780 --> 01:35:40,680
You can't dispute that.

1389
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:42,300
Konami sells the most.

1390
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:42,900
You got that.

1391
01:35:42,900 --> 01:35:45,020
Just argue why you want the quality of the games.

1392
01:35:45,020 --> 01:35:47,420
but in terms of sales, Konami is tops.

1393
01:35:47,420 --> 01:35:52,080
So number two and number three want to join forces

1394
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:54,340
to take out number one.

1395
01:35:54,340 --> 01:35:59,220
Where's the, where's the, that doesn't make sense in that

1396
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:00,380
because it makes total sense to me.

1397
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:01,700
It's war.

1398
01:36:01,700 --> 01:36:03,140
Yeah, it's number two and number three.

1399
01:36:03,140 --> 01:36:04,540
Ever play Risk?

1400
01:36:04,540 --> 01:36:05,380
Yeah.

1401
01:36:07,180 --> 01:36:08,860
Number two and number three are joining forces

1402
01:36:08,860 --> 01:36:10,220
to take out number one.

1403
01:36:10,220 --> 01:36:15,740
just like GameStop and EB merged to take out Walmart, right?

1404
01:36:15,740 --> 01:36:18,180
The thing is, though, this is only the arcade aspect.

1405
01:36:18,180 --> 01:36:22,660
I have not seen numbers on how well The Groove has sold on the PS2.

1406
01:36:22,660 --> 01:36:25,460
DDR still sells really well.

1407
01:36:25,460 --> 01:36:28,900
Pump It Up still hasn't come out here yet, so we can't judge that.

1408
01:36:28,900 --> 01:36:32,420
So they might fight for the dying arcade market,

1409
01:36:32,420 --> 01:36:35,460
but who's to say that this collaboration will have

1410
01:36:35,460 --> 01:36:37,860
any impact on the home version?

1411
01:36:37,860 --> 01:36:39,100
OK, good point.

1412
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:46,100
I can put fifty additional names in front of this goddamn game and it's still not going to make it one ounce better.

1413
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:48,100
Just a big ball of hate, Loki.

1414
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:50,100
Big ball of hate.

1415
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:51,100
Alright.

1416
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:54,100
In this case, it's a little deserved.

1417
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:57,100
Alright, you guys.

1418
01:36:57,100 --> 01:37:00,100
This is why we lost all the listeners, because they were listening in the-

1419
01:37:00,100 --> 01:37:03,100
Hey, listen, listen, if they make a good game, I'll give it, you know, good reviews.

1420
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:06,100
But if the game sucks, I'm going to tell you how it is.

1421
01:37:06,100 --> 01:37:11,620
wait a minute wait a minute hello to the game's credit you haven't played pump it

1422
01:37:11,620 --> 01:37:16,780
up in the group to yet correct so you don't know yet are you gonna give it at

1423
01:37:16,780 --> 01:37:23,020
least one playthrough I'll play it once once just to give it get a taste of how

1424
01:37:23,020 --> 01:37:29,600
crappy it is and then I'll just let you know how it is again but you have to go

1425
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:34,260
in there with an impartial view as the media let's go this way

1426
01:37:34,260 --> 01:37:39,740
I I I don't think your play to play as I've seen how it started off is really

1427
01:37:39,740 --> 01:37:40,640
shitty

1428
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:45,220
it should be pretty easy to impress me then it's gotta be better than crap

1429
01:37:45,220 --> 01:37:48,520
okay so that it has a pretty easy goal to hit

1430
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:49,940
if they can't do that

1431
01:37:49,940 --> 01:37:54,860
I'm sorry the media you need to be impartial like Fox News channel

1432
01:37:54,860 --> 01:37:56,820
Snicker snicker snort

1433
01:37:56,820 --> 01:38:00,820
Yeah, only those dirty republicans play in the group too, okay?

1434
01:38:04,820 --> 01:38:06,820
Is that better? Is that impartial?

1435
01:38:08,820 --> 01:38:10,820
I don't know what to tell you anymore, Loki. I just don't...

1436
01:38:12,820 --> 01:38:13,820
Alright.

1437
01:38:17,820 --> 01:38:20,820
They can have their pump-it-up. I have macadamia nuts. Everyone's happy.

1438
01:38:21,820 --> 01:38:24,820
I hope this doesn't last. I want them to split up really bad.

1439
01:38:24,820 --> 01:38:29,700
really bad. You want them to argue and fight about this? Yeah, I want Anamir to realize

1440
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:36,700
their wrongs and punch Roxor in the face and take all their money, all four dollars.

1441
01:38:37,100 --> 01:38:44,100
I think the new cabinets are interesting. I think they're kind of ugly, but I think

1442
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:50,860
they're interesting because they're really big and I like big things, so I'm kind of

1443
01:38:50,860 --> 01:38:54,540
curious to see more so interesting it's like putting a DDR pad on a pump it up

1444
01:38:54,540 --> 01:39:00,820
cabinet oh wait that's what it is well that's that forget let's go how are we

1445
01:39:00,820 --> 01:39:06,340
gonna make this for panel with the pump it up Kevin oh I got it there we go

1446
01:39:06,340 --> 01:39:11,180
that was easy and this way now they can get around selling those boxers because

1447
01:39:11,180 --> 01:39:13,940
you can just put it in a pump cabinet and replace the pad well yeah they're

1448
01:39:13,940 --> 01:39:18,740
not gonna get sued over this one unless well Adam Eros smart and then realizes

1449
01:39:18,740 --> 01:39:24,480
are so horrible for doing this and decides to drop the name and then sue them for putting

1450
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:27,500
stuff in their arcade machines. I hate RockSore.

1451
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:37,720
Alright, whatever. Moving on. I'm in the groove, fans. I tried to argue your case here, but

1452
01:39:37,720 --> 01:39:44,260
Loki just won't budge. One bit. I'm sorry, guys. What can I say? Alright, let's go on

1453
01:39:44,260 --> 01:39:46,260
Let's get into tonight's cage match, shall we?

1454
01:39:48,260 --> 01:39:49,260
Okay, we don't have to.

1455
01:39:50,260 --> 01:39:52,260
I was nodding, but no one heard it on the radio.

1456
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:53,260
Sorry, alright.

1457
01:39:56,260 --> 01:40:00,260
The way the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match works, we play three songs for you guys.

1458
01:40:00,260 --> 01:40:02,260
One that each host selects.

1459
01:40:02,260 --> 01:40:10,260
And the winning song, as voted by you guys, goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Video Game Music and More program,

1460
01:40:10,260 --> 01:40:13,260
which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on the station when we are not live.

1461
01:40:13,260 --> 01:40:18,980
So, you get to hear a clip of last week's song and two new songs in their entirety.

1462
01:40:18,980 --> 01:40:23,100
So let's hear first, the song that won last week.

1463
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:31,500
It's a clip, it's a remix by Loki, and it's Echo Image, remix by Loki, Skulk, the Misunderstood

1464
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:33,100
Mix is what it was called, I believe.

1465
01:40:33,100 --> 01:40:35,540
I don't remember, I just renamed it again, so whatever.

1466
01:40:35,540 --> 01:40:38,540
Well I think MP3 says Misunderstood Mix, so that's what we're gonna call it.

1467
01:40:38,540 --> 01:40:40,300
So here it is, a clip of song number one.

1468
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:45,660
remember you have to be in our chat room www.orensonsradio.com click on chat to vote and be a part of the cage

1469
01:40:45,660 --> 01:40:50,200
match all right here it is song number one echo or echo image remix by Loki

1470
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:57,200
Skulk, the misunderstood mix.

1471
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:39,060
I've lost the fragment of my soul

1472
01:41:39,060 --> 01:41:43,560
Take me in, that's what I've become

1473
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:47,060
I'm falling like I'm a fish

1474
01:41:47,060 --> 01:41:50,560
Make me take control of the world

1475
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:53,560
Make no excuses, I'm shit

1476
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:57,560
Take me in, that's what I've become

1477
01:41:57,560 --> 01:42:00,560
I know I've made it to the top of the street

1478
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:48,240
Alright, that was song number one, Echo Image remix by Loki Skulk, the misunderstood mix.

1479
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:50,760
That was the song you guys voted as the winner last week.

1480
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:55,840
Let's see if it can hang on two weeks in a row or if it gets dethroned by one of the

1481
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:57,560
new entries in tonight's cage match.

1482
01:42:57,560 --> 01:42:58,560
I think I'll start tonight.

1483
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,560
Dark Sakura, you can bring up the rear.

1484
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:04,560
Wait, that's supposed to...okay.

1485
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:06,560
Yeah, hahaha, I get it.

1486
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:08,560
Ha ha ha, I get it.

1487
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:15,560
My choice tonight, I liked that I Am Gothic song so much last week that I had to dig up some more songs by Spray.

1488
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:17,560
And I really like this song.

1489
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:20,560
And Dark Sakura, I know you're going to like this one. You have to.

1490
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:22,560
Do I have to?

1491
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:23,560
You have to.

1492
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:26,560
Because this is a song called I Kill With My Car.

1493
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:32,560
I like it already. Alright, let's hear it. Song number two in tonight's cage match, Spray with I Kill With My Car.

1494
01:43:56,560 --> 01:44:06,560
Cold chrome heartbeat, stainless steel Come on baby, take that step

1495
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:09,560
In front of me in death and death

1496
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:29,560
I can't live without, I can't live without

1497
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:39,560
Feet are the rattles, I start to sweat Girl machine, it's harmonic death

1498
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:48,560
Abandoned system, terribly Hear my baby hug me

1499
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:57,560
Hurling pension and thunder Grinding pension can't stop

1500
01:44:57,560 --> 01:45:02,560
I kill with my gun

1501
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:07,560
I kill with my gun

1502
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:12,560
I kill with my gun

1503
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:17,560
I kill with my gun

1504
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:20,560
It's a sexual brand

1505
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:23,560
Like power hide and release control

1506
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:28,060
It's an accuracy which keeps the fear away and on the road

1507
01:45:28,060 --> 01:45:32,560
It's an accuracy to meet this scenario

1508
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:37,560
If the sky is in the falls, I'm here alone

1509
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:42,060
Rubber on tarmac, grip the ground

1510
01:45:42,060 --> 01:45:47,060
Melting heartbeat, the firing crowd

1511
01:45:47,060 --> 01:45:51,560
Come on baby, clutch control

1512
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:55,560
It's in their senses to see that you're the best

1513
01:45:56,560 --> 01:46:01,560
I kill with my gun

1514
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:05,560
I kill with my gun

1515
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:10,560
I kill with my gun

1516
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:15,560
I kill with my gun

1517
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:53,840
Number two I kill with my car. What do you think dark Sakura? I I can't pull

1518
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:58,960
a Simon tonight I'm sorry. It gets to nine and a half just because there was a

1519
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:02,520
bit of repetition but it was pretty cool and you have to email that to me now. Oh

1520
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:08,800
my god she liked one of my songs. It wasn't crap trance! Every week it's like let's

1521
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:10,800
Let's fix something really poppy for...

1522
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:12,800
I like a lot of crap trance.

1523
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:14,800
Or crap trance? Or...

1524
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:16,800
Or less than crap trance?

1525
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:18,800
Or... Or...

1526
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:20,800
Or, uh, what's your face?

1527
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:22,800
Kelly Osbourne.

1528
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:24,800
Which is just crap, period.

1529
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,800
Alright, let's just see if I went over Logi.

1530
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:28,800
You know what?

1531
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:30,800
I'm sorry, it's gonna get a 5

1532
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:32,800
because it wasn't crap trance.

1533
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:34,800
You know, I was really expecting crap trance

1534
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:36,800
and this was not crap trance.

1535
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:39,120
So, it gets a five. That and the fat.

1536
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:42,960
Fuck you both! Fuck you both! That's all I have to say. Fuck you both.

1537
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:51,120
Teager. Ten. Spray. I like them.

1538
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:53,440
X to fur. What do you think?

1539
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:56,320
I give it a ten, too.

1540
01:47:57,360 --> 01:48:00,720
Alright. Alright, let's get into song number three.

1541
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:05,920
Remember, it's not our votes to count. It's yours in the chat room at www.orangesontrader.com.

1542
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:10,640
But you got one more song to pick from and it's dark soccer is would you pick five years ago?

1543
01:48:10,640 --> 01:48:13,560
I was on a rampage looking for dr. Bombay stuff

1544
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:19,000
Instead I downloaded a song which to my delight was by somebody that I you know really liked

1545
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:23,100
I downloaded a song by del the funky homosapien called. Dr. Bombay

1546
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:27,080
And I like to think so cuz those cool

1547
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:34,480
So and of course this I didn't even realize until after I picked the song and already email is like Oh gorillas connection, but oh

1548
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:43,480
The song is called, Del The Funky Homosapien.

1549
01:48:43,480 --> 01:48:49,880
All right here it is song number three tell the funky homo sapien dr. Bombay not related to the 2dx artist dr.

1550
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:51,880
Right, all right here we go

1551
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:23,880
Well, kick it, mutton tail, sing me a 40 as a lie-bar when I'm through

1552
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:27,880
You don't like it? Well, you got the kiss, where the sun don't shine

1553
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:30,880
Bumpin' like my behind, I lose the band but I'ma be fine

1554
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:35,880
Stop the feelin', think I still could make funk real good

1555
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:38,880
Take it then I lose it, make you say it

1556
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:42,880
The more the booty make you shake your rump

1557
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:44,880
Till the brand new feet bump

1558
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:49,880
a chunk cause I'm much like a hoe cause you don't get killed with fuckin' a chunk

1559
01:49:49,880 --> 01:49:53,880
Comin' from around the way, it's self added on as I survive time

1560
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:57,880
Just serve something, eat on something, eat on plate

1561
01:49:57,880 --> 01:50:00,880
Every time I try to get to me, it's always burnin' away

1562
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:06,880
Just serve something, what you find on it? What you say?

1563
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:10,880
What the fuck is guaranteed to make my day?

1564
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:12,880
So, so, so, so

1565
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:14,880
I'm as much as a black woman through the inspection

1566
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:16,880
And the question everybody is asking

1567
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:18,880
When you get your foot down

1568
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:20,880
A brother named George, it's the one fifty month old

1569
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:22,880
Let's take it to the stage, you suckers

1570
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:25,880
I jam, and Mr. Domenino eats much

1571
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:28,880
Back in the house with the two-how at Lindsey

1572
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:30,880
Now you know every day is terrific

1573
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:33,880
Drunk in the 1990s, jacked ironic

1574
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:35,880
The grass, we was back at X-Tronic

1575
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:37,880
Down with the links, mine straight from the ghetto

1576
01:50:37,880 --> 01:50:39,880
But I'm under the sun in the meadow

1577
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:41,880
Me and this Amazon sitting on my lap

1578
01:50:41,880 --> 01:50:45,180
Sittin' on my lap, she bust so big when she walkin' clackin'

1579
01:50:45,180 --> 01:50:48,380
Doin' the hoochie coochie and the four shawls know who I am

1580
01:50:48,380 --> 01:50:49,880
So girl sing the chorus

1581
01:50:49,880 --> 01:50:54,280
Dr. Bumpin', he don't stop and he don't play

1582
01:50:54,280 --> 01:50:57,080
Every time I try to get to me, he's always runnin' away

1583
01:50:57,080 --> 01:50:59,280
He's runnin' away, he's runnin' away

1584
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:03,480
Dr. Bumpin', got your body runnin', what you say?

1585
01:51:03,480 --> 01:51:06,480
When the funk is guaranteed to make my day

1586
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:15,480
Doctor Bombay, hit on stuff and hit on play Every time I try to catch him he's always running away

1587
01:51:15,480 --> 01:51:26,480
Doctor Bombay, Doctor Bombay

1588
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:31,480
Watch the watch, cause if your style's tall Your style's gonna damn sure make your house tall

1589
01:51:31,480 --> 01:51:36,480
You peed on my jaws on your fists, I'm a dog, so you might be wrong

1590
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:40,480
Wait, it ain't fool to jock, cause you're real far from a ballerina

1591
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:45,480
So, ooh, ooh, Mr. Dop-a-mina, freeze, and get up off your knees

1592
01:51:45,480 --> 01:51:50,480
Everything that Dr. Bump makes sex, is guaranteed to make you say

1593
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:54,480
So keep some side to head, I like clubmen hanging out with the dibs

1594
01:51:54,480 --> 01:51:59,480
And girl, if you ain't got a chair, I won't hesitate to pull out my funky lines

1595
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:01,480
But if you ain't down, what's your fault?

1596
01:52:01,480 --> 01:52:04,480
Capital your appointment and please get the hell on

1597
01:52:04,480 --> 01:52:06,480
Cause I won't have one switch on

1598
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:09,480
Under my nose, if you want eighty pieces of clothes

1599
01:52:09,480 --> 01:52:11,480
Get out my way so I can save the day

1600
01:52:11,480 --> 01:52:13,480
Cause I'm Dr. Rhombus

1601
01:52:13,480 --> 01:52:15,480
Dr. Rhombus

1602
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:17,480
Get on something, get on a plane

1603
01:52:17,480 --> 01:52:19,480
Every time I'm trying to get you in

1604
01:52:19,480 --> 01:52:21,480
It's always running away from you

1605
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:22,480
Please get a good man

1606
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:24,480
Dr. Rhombus

1607
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:38,160
Okay, that was Del the Funky Homo Sapien with Dr. Bombay.

1608
01:53:38,160 --> 01:53:41,320
Let's see if the doctor is in or out permanently.

1609
01:53:41,320 --> 01:53:42,840
Dark Sakura.

1610
01:53:42,840 --> 01:53:49,240
I could have been better, but I've been listening to this song a lot today, so it gets a 9.

1611
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:51,240
Alright, uh, Logie.

1612
01:53:51,240 --> 01:53:53,240
It gets a 9 too.

1613
01:53:53,240 --> 01:53:54,240
It's pretty cool.

1614
01:53:54,240 --> 01:53:55,240
But it wasn't trans.

1615
01:53:55,240 --> 01:53:56,240
You're an ass.

1616
01:53:56,240 --> 01:53:57,240
I thought he doesn't expect trans from me.

1617
01:53:57,240 --> 01:53:58,240
You're an ass.

1618
01:53:58,240 --> 01:53:59,240
Right?

1619
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:00,240
You're an ass.

1620
01:54:00,240 --> 01:54:01,240
He doesn't expect trans from me.

1621
01:54:01,240 --> 01:54:02,240
Ass.

1622
01:54:02,240 --> 01:54:03,240
Seagurd.

1623
01:54:03,240 --> 01:54:07,720
It made me think of Busta Move and Ham.

1624
01:54:07,720 --> 01:54:14,000
So if he were in another game, he would have had that as a theme song, so it gets an 8.

1625
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:20,440
That gets a resounding WTFF from me, but it was actually kind of funky, it was like what

1626
01:54:20,440 --> 01:54:23,520
the funky fuck, so it wasn't bad.

1627
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:27,400
I think they should have music like that in DDR.

1628
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:33,000
They need to mix that in. I completely agree. They need to mix the goth music up and stuff like that.

1629
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:34,340
Make a suggestion.

1630
01:54:34,340 --> 01:54:37,580
Tell the funky homo-sapien.

1631
01:54:37,580 --> 01:54:42,140
Yeah, can you write that on the next scantron that goes and makes the DDR games?

1632
01:54:42,140 --> 01:54:43,940
That would be great.

1633
01:54:43,940 --> 01:54:48,060
Oh, my score. I guess I give it a, I don't know, like a seven and a half.

1634
01:54:48,060 --> 01:54:51,260
It was Nito. X to Purr, do you want to give a score on that one?

1635
01:54:51,260 --> 01:54:53,580
tell the funky homo sapien

1636
01:54:53,580 --> 01:54:56,420
i think i would give it a nine

1637
01:54:56,420 --> 01:54:58,340
all right because i really enjoyed it

1638
01:54:58,340 --> 01:55:00,100
when you moved?

1639
01:55:00,100 --> 01:55:03,020
yes i did

1640
01:55:03,020 --> 01:55:07,300
all right remember it our scores don't count but yours do it's about time to

1641
01:55:07,300 --> 01:55:11,100

01:55:56,740 --> 01:56:01,580
winner in a few moments here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1649
01:56:01,580 --> 01:56:02,940
What are you kids talking about back there?

1650
01:56:02,940 --> 01:56:06,740
I was saying that I found a whole bunch of CDs that I hope aren't warped, so I was going

1651
01:56:06,740 --> 01:56:10,400
and try to burn myself a new car CD and that was gonna go on it so instead of

1652
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:18,400
being all eurobeat driving in my Lancer I'll be all side to side you know what

1653
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:22,880
what I'm listening to that song and if I was driving and listening to this song I

1654
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:32,920
think I would be like check and turn a signal to the left a signal to the right

1655
01:56:32,920 --> 01:56:36,920
Props to you if you get that reference, by the way.

1656
01:56:36,920 --> 01:56:40,920
How can you not get that reference? You're an idiot if you don't get that reference.

1657
01:56:40,920 --> 01:56:44,920
I hope that folks in the chatroom get that. But seriously, that's what it sounds

1658
01:56:44,920 --> 01:56:48,920
like to me. DarkSakura, when you do that, and you

1659
01:56:48,920 --> 01:56:52,920
ride in the car, tell me that your mind will not do that. Do that check

1660
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:56,920
and turn. This is the left. Now it was step on the right.

1661
01:56:56,920 --> 01:57:00,920
I'm just gonna be all like, I'll be like, shit yeah, it's Del.

1662
01:57:00,920 --> 01:57:05,760
Um, this is the part of the show where we usually ask our buddy, Loki, what's going

1663
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:09,320
on in the Sims scene, because Lord knows I don't follow it.

1664
01:57:09,320 --> 01:57:10,320
Loki!

1665
01:57:10,320 --> 01:57:14,280
Well, I told you earlier what exactly happened, and the main thing that happened this week

1666
01:57:14,280 --> 01:57:20,440
was that the In the Groove theme is released for StepMania, and that is it.

1667
01:57:20,440 --> 01:57:23,240
No new Max 300 remixes of notes?

1668
01:57:23,240 --> 01:57:24,240
No.

1669
01:57:24,240 --> 01:57:25,240
Alright.

1670
01:57:25,240 --> 01:57:30,880
So, one thing I do want to ask you about then, since there's not a lot going on in the Sims

1671
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:34,880
I kind of want to, this kind of blurs the line here, this isn't necessarily DDR related,

1672
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:37,880
but we get to talk about other games when we want to on the show as well.

1673
01:57:37,880 --> 01:57:40,880
What is up with the PSP homebrew stuff?

1674
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:45,880
I know it was released this week, how does it work? Is it good? Tell us about it.

1675
01:57:45,880 --> 01:57:47,880
Put down warriorware for a minute, tell us about it.

1676
01:57:47,880 --> 01:57:50,880
Damn you, hit the pause button. Thank you.

1677
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:56,880
Ugh, fine. Anyways, the whole thing with the homebrew stuff,

1678
01:57:56,880 --> 01:58:03,520
homebrew stuff. Basically, they found a workaround to get, you know, games to work on version

1679
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:10,620
1.5 PSPs. And for those who don't know, the version 1.0 PSPs were the very first PSP shipped

1680
01:58:10,620 --> 01:58:15,520
in Japan. And those had a hole in it in their encryption or whatever that allowed you to

1681
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:21,800
run your own homebrew code on PSPs. Well, they fixed that in the U.S. ones which are

1682
01:58:21,800 --> 01:58:27,400
now version 1.5 where you couldn't do that. So, the way they've gotten around it is they

1683
01:58:27,400 --> 01:58:33,560
have almost like a swap technique. It's like, you know, the old PlayStation swap thing where

1684
01:58:33,560 --> 01:58:38,840
you put in one disk and you swap it with another and you basically trick it into thinking that

1685
01:58:38,840 --> 01:58:45,360
it's one thing when it's not. So, what we did is you actually take a memory card with

1686
01:58:45,360 --> 01:58:51,360
an image of a file on it and you put it in, load the game and while it's loading, you

1687
01:58:51,360 --> 01:58:56,420
really quickly swap in the other memory card so it thinks it's loading something else.

1688
01:58:56,420 --> 01:59:03,700
And then that in turn allows your game to run. And so now what they have available for

1689
01:59:03,700 --> 01:59:09,340
is like all the mainstream emulators out there so you can emulate, you know, Nintendo and

1690
01:59:09,340 --> 01:59:13,380
the Super Nintendo, Genesis, Mega Drive, you know.

1691
01:59:13,380 --> 01:59:17,700
Why is it so easy to port all these emulators over the PSP? Is it because the PSP is like

1692
01:59:17,700 --> 01:59:18,900
a mini PC or something?

1693
01:59:18,900 --> 01:59:38,900
No, it's just run off of, you basically adapt your code to whatever processor it is, and I forget what kind it is, but it's basically, just like, you know, the difference between the Nintendo DS and the Game Boy Advance, it's just ARM 9 and ARM 7. They're really almost the same processor, so you only have to change your code a little bit.

1694
01:59:38,900 --> 01:59:43,080
It's like kind of programming in, say, C versus C++ or

1695
01:59:43,080 --> 01:59:44,320
Visual C++.

1696
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:47,080
There's a few different ways you program stuff.

1697
01:59:47,080 --> 01:59:49,680
And so you have to program it differently for that.

1698
01:59:49,680 --> 01:59:51,280
And so it's easy to port it over.

1699
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:53,680
Well, now, obviously, this process doesn't take much time

1700
01:59:53,680 --> 01:59:57,160
because I was looking at the emulators.

1701
01:59:57,160 --> 02:00:02,040
Now, they just were able to get this fix in for America.

1702
02:00:02,040 --> 02:00:03,480
And I thought a lot of these programs

1703
02:00:03,480 --> 02:00:04,600
kind of originated here.

1704
02:00:04,600 --> 02:00:07,600
So I was kind of surprised with how fast emulators were

1705
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:07,800
happening.

1706
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:12,280
Well the emulators also too, you're getting homebrew games in there too, like for example

1707
02:00:12,280 --> 02:00:17,260
this game called Beats of Rage, which is a Streets of Rage clone, that's in there, Doom,

1708
02:00:17,260 --> 02:00:21,700
they ported Doom over, and anything that runs off of WAD, so you have Doom, Heretic, Doom

1709
02:00:21,700 --> 02:00:27,120
2, and I've even seen some, I don't know what exactly it is, like Quake and Duke Nukem

1710
02:00:27,120 --> 02:00:34,840
3D, but I think those are just conversions or mods of Doom or something, but those are

1711
02:00:34,840 --> 02:00:38,620
available and then you see actually people making like basic programs like chess and

1712
02:00:38,620 --> 02:00:46,180
tic-tac-toe and whatnot, those are available and pretty much, you know, this is just going

1713
02:00:46,180 --> 02:00:51,700
to keep going, you know, and they've found a way, supposedly now, Sony's like, oh yeah,

1714
02:00:51,700 --> 02:00:55,980
well we're going to try to make you upgrade again so this hole's closed so you can't do

1715
02:00:55,980 --> 02:00:56,980
this.

1716
02:00:56,980 --> 02:00:59,540
But, you know, it's just something fun to do while you're waiting for more games to

1717
02:00:59,540 --> 02:01:02,620
come out for the PSP, it's really what it comes down to.

1718
02:01:02,620 --> 02:01:06,120
very in a how would they close the whole of what they would be force your

1719
02:01:06,120 --> 02:01:09,740
firmware to upgrade yet with the new game basically a new game would come out

1720
02:01:09,740 --> 02:01:12,960
they would have the firmware update software on their in or the game the run

1721
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:16,680
it update your firmware to like one five two or something

1722
02:01:16,680 --> 02:01:18,200
anyway for she do that

1723
02:01:18,200 --> 02:01:21,360
is there a game out there that does that now of their japanese games to do that

1724
02:01:21,360 --> 02:01:22,600
uh... okay

1725
02:01:22,600 --> 02:01:24,040
uh... but they really should be jack

1726
02:01:24,040 --> 02:01:27,600
himself on the planet but you have both a like grand theft auto

1727
02:01:27,600 --> 02:01:30,880
will probably have something that i'd be screwed i would be tough if that

1728
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:33,880
that's the case, because then they'd be like, ah, dammit.

1729
02:01:33,880 --> 02:01:35,920
And they probably would do it with a game like that, because

1730
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:37,000
everyone's going to buy that game.

1731
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:40,440
Now, my next question is, like we said earlier, when a

1732
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:44,680
website or a game company says, you will not be able to

1733
02:01:44,680 --> 02:01:45,920
decrypt our encryption.

1734
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:48,360
That is just an invite for hackers to hack it.

1735
02:01:48,360 --> 02:01:52,080
So what's to say that 1.5.2 won't be cracked soon enough?

1736
02:01:52,080 --> 02:01:53,280
It just might.

1737
02:01:53,280 --> 02:01:56,840
Or what they might do is get away to where it doesn't

1738
02:01:56,840 --> 02:01:58,840
matter what firmware you update it to.

1739
02:01:58,840 --> 02:02:02,440
it's not going to... it'll bypass the whole encryption thing all together.

1740
02:02:02,440 --> 02:02:07,120
Basically just a workaround for it. It's possible because, like, for example,

1741
02:02:07,120 --> 02:02:12,200
earlier this week supposedly leaked on the internet was their entire library

1742
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:15,960
for all the library files for

1743
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:21,880
the PSP development kit. So, if you get a hold of that, you're going to see how everything works

1744
02:02:21,880 --> 02:02:24,900
and it won't matter how many times you upgrade the firmware. They're just going to have a way

1745
02:02:24,900 --> 02:02:25,480
around it

1746
02:02:25,480 --> 02:02:30,160
where it'll think it's like a version whatever. It'll think it's a UMD or something.

1747
02:02:30,160 --> 02:02:34,420
We'll just get away around it. In my opinion, this kind of sells PSPs. I kind of want one

1748
02:02:34,420 --> 02:02:37,320
even more now, knowing I can play Legend of Zelda on it.

1749
02:02:37,320 --> 02:02:40,760
They don't understand that, you know, I mean, granted, it's, you know,

1750
02:02:40,760 --> 02:02:44,000
they should just allow it to run homebrew code, but I don't think they want to be

1751
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:48,000
responsible for, like, this kind of stuff. For any of this kind of stuff, so they have to, you know,

1752
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:49,520
actively try to,

1753
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:54,120
you know, upgrade, you know, the firmware. What I would do is just say, well, we have it up,

1754
02:02:54,120 --> 02:02:58,080
you know the firmware can be you know the upgrade can be downloaded and it

1755
02:02:58,080 --> 02:03:00,840
fixes this problem leave it at that and just let you know

1756
02:03:00,840 --> 02:03:04,720
because I noticed that the DS isn't doing anything like that

1757
02:03:04,720 --> 02:03:07,520
then you're going to have Linux on there and then you're going to be able to run pretty much anything

1758
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:11,960
well almost anything on there. But isn't it harder to get something on the DS because the

1759
02:03:11,960 --> 02:03:14,560
DS doesn't have that whole memory stick thing

1760
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:18,160
Granted it has the flash cards. Yeah the flash cards are the

1761
02:03:18,160 --> 02:03:22,400
way you do that. But I think what they're doing right now with

1762
02:03:22,400 --> 02:03:27,480
The PSP, though, is they've got, um, well, some of the things I thought were pretty cool

1763
02:03:27,480 --> 02:03:31,400
is you can actually overclock your PC in some of these games, because it is running.

1764
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:37,680
The chip's supposed to run at 333 megahertz, but it actually runs at 222, so some of these

1765
02:03:37,680 --> 02:03:42,260
emulators, they actually have it where you can overclock it to 333, so, you know, it

1766
02:03:42,260 --> 02:03:47,160
runs at what it's supposed to, and so, so, it's just interesting to see what you can

1767
02:03:47,160 --> 02:03:48,160
do with this.

1768
02:03:48,160 --> 02:03:51,140
And, Beats of Rage is awesome, because it has so many different mods to it, so you can

1769
02:03:51,140 --> 02:03:55,020
play like you know it's basically a final fight so you can do it with

1770
02:03:55,020 --> 02:03:58,820
whatever characters you want like Megaman or ghosts and goblins I've seen

1771
02:03:58,820 --> 02:04:03,420
some really strange mods out there kill bill someone's made a mod for that you

1772
02:04:03,420 --> 02:04:09,020
know so it's interesting interesting hmm all I know is that when I saw Legend of

1773
02:04:09,020 --> 02:04:12,500
Zelda being played the the first thing and I know a secret thought of this was

1774
02:04:12,500 --> 02:04:17,140
that oh my gosh we could play Kid Icarus on the PSP and that makes the PSP just

1775
02:04:17,140 --> 02:04:19,620
totally worth having and I was just thinking about that too and I was just

1776
02:04:19,620 --> 02:04:29,580
kind of fantasizing tell me this doesn't make you happy damn you Nintendo damn

1777
02:04:29,580 --> 02:04:33,540
you and then over not putting it's gonna I can tell you pretty much it's gonna be

1778
02:04:33,540 --> 02:04:39,820
in goddamn Animal Crossing DS it's gonna be better be better be I want the new I

1779
02:04:39,820 --> 02:04:44,260
want a new kid of Chris though and no 3d crap I want like a I just remember the

1780
02:04:44,260 --> 02:04:47,980
What was that comic?

1781
02:04:47,980 --> 02:04:53,820
They don't do it anymore, but it was sort of like 8-bit theater.

1782
02:04:53,820 --> 02:04:57,660
They had Mario and all the guys hanging out at the bar, and no one's talking about their

1783
02:04:57,660 --> 02:05:01,660
upgrades and Pip's like, hey, I want one!

1784
02:05:01,660 --> 02:05:04,100
Sorry, you don't get one.

1785
02:05:04,100 --> 02:05:09,940
I remember Miyamoto saying something at E3 about he wants to put Kid Icarus on the revolution

1786
02:05:09,940 --> 02:05:10,940
like a new one.

1787
02:05:10,940 --> 02:05:11,940
He's a good cop.

1788
02:05:11,940 --> 02:05:13,940
He's what he is, honestly.

1789
02:05:13,940 --> 02:05:20,940
I'll take a tactics game or first-person shooter with pit, but as long as I get a Kid Icarus game

1790
02:05:20,940 --> 02:05:26,060
That's what I know. I will not accept any of that crap. I want a good old

1791
02:05:26,780 --> 02:05:28,300
2d

1792
02:05:28,300 --> 02:05:33,820
Shooter with three like like beautiful to Joe ish that just now with that cell cell cells

1793
02:05:34,420 --> 02:05:36,420
cell shading stuff

1794
02:05:36,420 --> 02:05:42,220
But imagine looking through pits eyes while you're pulling back the arrow to shoot. No, I'm a wizard in his one

1795
02:05:42,220 --> 02:05:43,220
And I...

1796
02:05:43,220 --> 02:05:44,220
It would just be Metroid!

1797
02:05:44,220 --> 02:05:46,460
I don't care if they did a good job with it.

1798
02:05:46,460 --> 02:05:53,460
And I'm not even like the biggest Metroid Prime fan, I mean it's okay, I like it okay.

1799
02:05:53,460 --> 02:05:57,140
But of course people would just say that that's because I have this intense hatred for first

1800
02:05:57,140 --> 02:05:59,000
person shooters, which you know, whatever.

1801
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:00,500
Which is why you own Halo 1 and 2.

1802
02:06:00,500 --> 02:06:05,220
Yeah, which is why I own Halo 1 and 2.

1803
02:06:05,220 --> 02:06:11,900
Alright, um, let's find out who won tonight's cage match, shall we?

1804
02:06:11,900 --> 02:06:21,720
cage match the winner is you guys ready for this it is a tie tonight and it's

1805
02:06:21,720 --> 02:06:29,600
our favorite kind of tie boys it's a three-way tie tonight so we got to go

1806
02:06:29,600 --> 02:06:34,840
look at the Orange Lounge Radio rule book and let's see here oh yes I

1807
02:06:34,840 --> 02:06:38,840
believe the way a three-way tie works for the Orange Lounge Radio cage match

1808
02:06:38,840 --> 02:06:46,700
rules is that the song that won last week is automatically tossed and the

1809
02:06:46,700 --> 02:06:51,580
host who put that song in breaks the tie from the other two so Loki your song

1810
02:06:51,580 --> 02:06:55,760
gets tossed actually you're wrong it's actually the person that's a guest in

1811
02:06:55,760 --> 02:06:59,380
the studio gets to pick no no I know I'm right on this one I know I'm right on

1812
02:06:59,380 --> 02:07:06,580
this one I got a sedan grader you got to break a tie what's it gonna be is it

1813
02:07:06,580 --> 02:07:09,860
going to be Spray, I Kill With My Car, or Del The Funky

1814
02:07:09,860 --> 02:07:11,780
Homo Sapien with Dr. Bombay.

1815
02:07:11,780 --> 02:07:12,780
Dr. Bombay.

1816
02:07:12,780 --> 02:07:13,940
All righty.

1817
02:07:13,940 --> 02:07:16,500
Del The Funky Homo Sapien with Dr. Bombay in a very, very

1818
02:07:16,500 --> 02:07:18,180
close vote tonight.

1819
02:07:18,180 --> 02:07:21,140
The funk is guaranteed to make my day.

1820
02:07:21,140 --> 02:07:23,100
So, so, so, little girl.

1821
02:07:23,100 --> 02:07:24,540
Mars is a black woman's movie.

1822
02:07:24,540 --> 02:07:25,260
All right.

1823
02:07:25,260 --> 02:07:27,180
Check and turn and settle to the left.

1824
02:07:27,180 --> 02:07:30,740
That will be in rotation all week long on Orange on

1825
02:07:30,740 --> 02:07:33,380
Australia, and we'll come back for its chance at a second

1826
02:07:33,380 --> 02:07:34,180
week victory.

1827
02:07:34,180 --> 02:07:38,660
But boys and girls, songs that prevail in three-way ties

1828
02:07:38,660 --> 02:07:40,300
very rarely last more than one week.

1829
02:07:40,300 --> 02:07:41,140
But we shall see.

1830
02:07:41,140 --> 02:07:42,620
We shall see.

1831
02:07:42,620 --> 02:07:43,260
All right.

1832
02:07:43,260 --> 02:07:46,940
Loki, you don't want your song to win out anyway.

1833
02:07:46,940 --> 02:07:48,340
Oh, I like this in the chat room.

1834
02:07:48,340 --> 02:07:49,900
Skye's will is absolute.

1835
02:07:49,900 --> 02:07:50,820
I like this.

1836
02:07:50,820 --> 02:07:51,780
Makes me feel special.

1837
02:07:55,900 --> 02:07:57,540
Pardon me while I stroke my ego here.

1838
02:07:57,540 --> 02:07:58,420
We're going to go to a break.

1839
02:07:58,420 --> 02:07:59,900
And when we come back from this break, we will be taking-

1840
02:07:59,900 --> 02:08:02,580
Is that your ego?

1841
02:08:02,580 --> 02:08:03,980
You're disgusting.

1842
02:08:03,980 --> 02:08:07,020
When we come back from this break,

1843
02:08:07,020 --> 02:08:08,980
we will take your calls on the Skype line,

1844
02:08:08,980 --> 02:08:11,940
and of course, we will get to the FUs of the week as well.

1845
02:08:11,940 --> 02:08:15,420
And I think that statement there brings a certain song

1846
02:08:15,420 --> 02:08:16,700
to mind that needs playing.

1847
02:08:16,700 --> 02:08:18,620
So let's get to a little bit of DJ Taka here.

1848
02:08:18,620 --> 02:08:21,540
We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio.

1849
02:09:21,540 --> 02:09:26,540
a

1850
02:09:26,540 --> 02:09:31,540
a

1851
02:09:31,540 --> 02:09:36,540
a

1852
02:09:36,540 --> 02:09:41,540
a

1853
02:09:41,540 --> 02:09:46,540
a

1854
02:10:16,540 --> 02:10:18,540
You

1855
02:14:16,540 --> 02:14:19,040
Now I'm saying goodbye, don't do it

1856
02:14:20,040 --> 02:14:25,040
And if I'm sleeping still, oh, I'm thinking of your sweet, sweet mama

1857
02:14:25,040 --> 02:14:29,540
Well, I like your good, your good, but I just can't decide

1858
02:14:30,540 --> 02:14:33,540
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

1859
02:14:33,540 --> 02:14:35,540
Let me know if you love me

1860
02:15:03,540 --> 02:15:18,260
Take away, take away, take away, take away

1861
02:15:18,260 --> 02:15:21,260
Are you ready?

1862
02:15:21,260 --> 02:15:23,260
Are you ready?

1863
02:15:23,260 --> 02:15:26,260
Are you ready?

1864
02:15:26,260 --> 02:15:27,260
Are you ready?

1865
02:15:27,260 --> 02:15:24,420
Let up

1866
02:15:24,420 --> 02:15:26,260
Are you ready?

1867
02:15:26,260 --> 02:15:27,260
Are you ready?

1868
02:15:27,260 --> 02:15:28,260
Are you ready?

1869
02:15:28,260 --> 02:15:30,260
Are you ready?

1870
02:15:30,260 --> 02:15:35,260
Are you ready?

1871
02:15:35,260 --> 02:15:36,260
Are you ready?

1872
02:15:36,260 --> 02:15:43,260
Are you ready?

1873
02:15:43,260 --> 02:15:44,760
Are you ready?

1874
02:15:44,760 --> 02:15:47,260
Are you ready?

1875
02:15:47,260 --> 02:16:09,540
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of

1876
02:16:09,540 --> 02:16:12,940
the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

1877
02:16:12,940 --> 02:16:18,440
Um, Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bamani Music & More program. Can we talk about that?

1878
02:16:18,440 --> 02:16:20,940
No subject will ever be taboo.

1879
02:16:20,940 --> 02:16:24,940
Well, I was thinking maybe we should move, pump up the volume from Tuesday nights?

1880
02:16:24,940 --> 02:16:27,940
Except, of course, the subject that was just on our discussion.

1881
02:16:27,940 --> 02:16:33,940
Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

1882
02:16:33,940 --> 02:16:35,940
I collect your fucking head.

1883
02:16:37,440 --> 02:16:39,440
Just like this fucker here.

1884
02:16:39,440 --> 02:16:48,440
kostjamrh Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki? The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

1885
02:16:48,440 --> 02:16:55,440
Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

1886
02:16:55,440 --> 02:17:03,440
Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say

1887
02:17:03,440 --> 02:17:08,440
We need to make our listeners do the work for us, honestly.

1888
02:17:08,440 --> 02:17:09,440
I have an idea for one.

1889
02:17:09,440 --> 02:17:10,440
Do you?

1890
02:17:10,440 --> 02:17:11,440
Yeah.

1891
02:17:11,440 --> 02:17:15,440
We need to make a thread in our super secret forum and keep these ideas flowing.

1892
02:17:15,440 --> 02:17:18,440
Because sometimes I think of ideas at work and then I forget to write them down and then they're gone forever.

1893
02:17:18,440 --> 02:17:21,440
I have to sneak onto the web page to be able to update at work.

1894
02:17:21,440 --> 02:17:23,440
Well, you can always send me an email and I'll post it for you.

1895
02:17:23,440 --> 02:17:24,440
Okay.

1896
02:17:24,440 --> 02:17:25,440
Because you can do that.

1897
02:17:25,440 --> 02:17:26,440
Isn't that weird that you can do email but you can't do internet?

1898
02:17:26,440 --> 02:17:28,440
An email that doesn't work half the time.

1899
02:17:28,440 --> 02:17:32,600
because the thing of the way that the email at my work is is that they're supposed to

1900
02:17:32,600 --> 02:17:37,680
be sort of server to block outside mail, which actually only works half of the time and never

1901
02:17:37,680 --> 02:17:46,120
works on you. I always get your email. And no, none of you in the chat room get my work

1902
02:17:46,120 --> 02:17:50,400
email, so sawed off.

1903
02:17:50,400 --> 02:17:56,520
All right. The Skype line is open. If you guys want to give us a call, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

1904
02:17:56,520 --> 02:17:59,480
on interact with us and look at that it's lighting up already

1905
02:17:59,480 --> 02:18:03,400
I think our listeners are starting to understand that when they don't call in

1906
02:18:03,400 --> 02:18:07,320
that Paris Hilton is going to come up so they're getting smart so we have a call

1907
02:18:07,320 --> 02:18:09,480
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio

1908
02:18:09,480 --> 02:18:11,920
Hi, Sephiroth1215 here

1909
02:18:11,920 --> 02:18:15,960
Hello, Sephiroth1215 and I know you're calling in to talk about that new Paris Hilton

1910
02:18:15,960 --> 02:18:18,120
Carl's Jr. commercial, right?

1911
02:18:18,120 --> 02:18:21,200
Yeah, of course, that's pretty cool

1912
02:18:21,200 --> 02:18:23,440
That's hot, huh?

1913
02:18:23,440 --> 02:18:26,200
Oh yeah, it is

1914
02:18:26,200 --> 02:18:28,200
Yes, what's on your mind?

1915
02:18:28,840 --> 02:18:32,440
I don't know just some random stuff. I guess oh I

1916
02:18:32,960 --> 02:18:37,660
Mean last week. I got you know the in the groove and afterburner pad bundle

1917
02:18:38,120 --> 02:18:41,960
What do you think because I honestly I haven't picked up in the groove yet

1918
02:18:41,960 --> 02:18:46,320
And that has nothing to do with like Loki's distaste of the game rubbing off on me or anything

1919
02:18:46,320 --> 02:18:49,500
It's just that I actually don't have an American ps2

1920
02:18:49,500 --> 02:18:52,760
And I don't want to mod my Japanese one because I know I will fuck it up

1921
02:18:52,760 --> 02:18:58,760
So I am kind of waiting until I can afford an American PS2, so I'm curious. How's the game?

1922
02:18:58,760 --> 02:19:05,760
It's okay. It's going to hold me over until like September, you know, when Extreme 2 comes out.

1923
02:19:05,760 --> 02:19:12,760
Not to mention, with the After Burner pad, I have to basically go back to all the other games and get new scores on them.

1924
02:19:12,760 --> 02:19:14,760
So I'm pretty good this summer.

1925
02:19:14,760 --> 02:19:17,760
What do you think of the After Burner pad? That's the brand new Metal pad, right?

1926
02:19:17,760 --> 02:19:19,760
So how's that working out for you?

1927
02:19:19,760 --> 02:19:25,080
At first, I thought it wasn't worth the money, but once I broke in the arrows, everything

1928
02:19:25,080 --> 02:19:29,640
was perfectly fine. It works great. I mean, I have a lot of fun with it.

1929
02:19:29,640 --> 02:19:34,600
How much are your scores improving on the old games?

1930
02:19:34,600 --> 02:19:39,920
Pretty much by a whole grade. Awesome. Secret, I have a curious question.

1931
02:19:39,920 --> 02:19:42,760
I don't know if you can answer this or what, but when you guys are testing the game at

1932
02:19:42,760 --> 02:19:46,880
Konami, I know you guys don't actually... Use softpads.

1933
02:19:46,880 --> 02:19:51,880
You do play Konami softpads. Oh, you use the official Konami pads, you don't use the other products.

1934
02:19:51,880 --> 02:19:56,880
I was just curious if you ever used the metal stuff. I'll tell you why after we're off the air.

1935
02:19:56,880 --> 02:19:59,880
Okay, okay. Sounds good.

1936
02:19:59,880 --> 02:20:02,880
Um, let's see, so...

1937
02:20:02,880 --> 02:20:05,880
What else have you been playing besides In the Groove?

1938
02:20:05,880 --> 02:20:07,880
And the old games?

1939
02:20:07,880 --> 02:20:12,880
Well, I don't know, there hasn't been much otherwise for normal games.

1940
02:20:12,880 --> 02:20:18,880
I'm just going some old stuff now. I just got Star Ocean since it went to a greatest hits price.

1941
02:20:18,880 --> 02:20:21,880
I love that when the games get cheaper, because they're greatest hits.

1942
02:20:21,880 --> 02:20:24,880
That's usually when I end up buying them.

1943
02:20:24,880 --> 02:20:25,880
Awesome.

1944
02:20:25,880 --> 02:20:27,880
And it's been happening rapidly.

1945
02:20:27,880 --> 02:20:30,880
Okay, anything else you wanted to call in tonight, ask us about?

1946
02:20:30,880 --> 02:20:34,880
Any questions for us here in the studio, or Seagurd, our guest, or whatever?

1947
02:20:34,880 --> 02:20:37,880
Not really. I guess I'm good now.

1948
02:20:37,880 --> 02:20:40,880
Alright, sounds good. Well thank you for calling in.

1949
02:20:40,880 --> 02:20:41,880
No problem.

1950
02:20:41,880 --> 02:20:43,880
Alright, anytime. Have a good one.

1951
02:20:43,880 --> 02:20:45,880
You too. Bye.

1952
02:20:45,880 --> 02:20:47,880
Alright.

1953
02:20:47,880 --> 02:20:49,880
Skyfline's open again if you want to give us a call.

1954
02:20:49,880 --> 02:20:51,880
www.orangelaungeradio.com

1955
02:20:51,880 --> 02:20:53,880
Click on interact with us and that has all

1956
02:20:53,880 --> 02:20:55,880
the details you need

1957
02:20:55,880 --> 02:20:57,880
in order to connect with us.

1958
02:20:57,880 --> 02:20:59,880
While we're waiting for

1959
02:20:59,880 --> 02:21:01,880
another call, if we get one, I don't know

1960
02:21:01,880 --> 02:21:03,880
like I said, our listeners are down. I don't know

1961
02:21:03,880 --> 02:21:05,880
if it's just college or they're studying for finals

1962
02:21:05,880 --> 02:21:07,880
or graduating or whatever's going on in your neck of the woods.

1963
02:21:07,880 --> 02:21:09,880
I want to mention real quick

1964
02:21:09,880 --> 02:21:13,680
that we actually have a LiveJournal system set up. Now you guys know about

1965
02:21:13,680 --> 02:21:17,360
our LiveJournal community at Orange Lounge. Well this, I didn't know about

1966
02:21:17,360 --> 02:21:22,160
this until tonight. One of our listeners, Arcadia, excuse me, Arcadia 42 is also a

1967
02:21:22,160 --> 02:21:28,120
frequent guest of the show, actually created an Orange Lounge radio podcast

1968
02:21:28,120 --> 02:21:33,460
feed in LiveJournal. Now it doesn't actually automatically download the

1969
02:21:33,460 --> 02:21:38,000
podcast for you, but what it does, if you add this to your LiveJournal, it will let

1970
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:42,620
you know when a new one has been posted so you can think oh okay it's time to go

1971
02:21:42,620 --> 02:21:47,640
in and sync using iPod or it's time to go in and you know grab it on Podcast

1972
02:21:47,640 --> 02:21:52,040
Alley or whatever you guys are using to get our podcast. The name of the

1973
02:21:52,040 --> 02:21:58,160
community is O-L-R underscore podcast and if you want to be able to find the whole

1974
02:21:58,160 --> 02:22:04,840
link there it's just www.livejournal.com slash users slash O-L-R underscore

1975
02:22:04,840 --> 02:22:09,520
our podcast. So if you add that username to your friends list over on LiveJournal, then

1976
02:22:09,520 --> 02:22:12,800
you will know when new podcasts are posted. You also get the brief little description

1977
02:22:12,800 --> 02:22:18,480
about what we talk about on each one, our little synopsis. So check that out. And also

1978
02:22:18,480 --> 02:22:26,120
don't forget to vote for us over on podcastalley.com because we appreciate your vote. And there's

1979
02:22:26,120 --> 02:22:30,320
also another we need your help type thing I will talk about a little later. I'm going

1980
02:22:30,320 --> 02:22:37,080
to bring that up in a few minutes here after we get through some other stuff. I do not

1981
02:22:37,080 --> 02:22:43,880
see any other calls coming in so I guess that's it. There's quite a few people online so I'm

1982
02:22:43,880 --> 02:22:47,200
kind of surprised that nobody else wants to call but that's fine. A question from our

1983
02:22:47,200 --> 02:22:51,560
chat room though, I think this is more for Dark Sacra. When does the podcast Poop Shoot

1984
02:22:51,560 --> 02:22:58,800
go live? You know what? I've been busy. Did you turn up my microphone? Yeah, you're on.

1985
02:22:58,800 --> 02:22:59,800
You turned up my microphone, though.

1986
02:22:59,800 --> 02:23:00,800
No, it's not.

1987
02:23:00,800 --> 02:23:01,800
It's too loud.

1988
02:23:01,800 --> 02:23:02,800
It's...

1989
02:23:02,800 --> 02:23:03,800
I turned up the in-house speakers.

1990
02:23:03,800 --> 02:23:04,800
Okay.

1991
02:23:04,800 --> 02:23:05,800
Turn this down, please.

1992
02:23:05,800 --> 02:23:06,800
Sorry.

1993
02:23:06,800 --> 02:23:07,800
Not...

1994
02:23:07,800 --> 02:23:08,800
I...

1995
02:23:08,800 --> 02:23:09,800
Hearing the reverb gives this, like, instant headache for me.

1996
02:23:09,800 --> 02:23:13,160
I have to turn it up to hear the calls on Skype.

1997
02:23:13,160 --> 02:23:14,160
Yeah.

1998
02:23:14,160 --> 02:23:15,160
All right.

1999
02:23:15,160 --> 02:23:19,160
At any rate, if you come over to my house and pack up all my crap and move it to my

2000
02:23:19,160 --> 02:23:21,800
new house, then maybe I'll make it.

2001
02:23:21,800 --> 02:23:22,800
So...

2002
02:23:22,800 --> 02:23:26,280
Or pay for the domain for me.

2003
02:23:26,280 --> 02:23:27,280
I don't know.

2004
02:23:27,280 --> 02:23:32,360
I'm still looking for someone to take the domain I registered and never used for a death

2005
02:23:32,360 --> 02:23:33,360
cake.

2006
02:23:33,360 --> 02:23:36,280
And you could make a pornography site out of it if you want.

2007
02:23:36,280 --> 02:23:37,280
No, that's okay.

2008
02:23:37,280 --> 02:23:40,000
I've actually registered lastlivingsouls.com.

2009
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Alright.

2010
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:45,760
So anyways, our chat room is saying they're all shy, they don't want to call in and be

2011
02:23:45,760 --> 02:23:46,760
on air tonight.

2012
02:23:46,760 --> 02:23:47,760
Fine.

2013
02:23:47,760 --> 02:23:48,760
So anyways.

2014
02:23:48,760 --> 02:23:49,760
At least we got the one going.

2015
02:23:49,760 --> 02:23:53,480
If you don't call in, I will come over to your house and personally kick your butt until

2016
02:23:53,480 --> 02:23:54,480
you call in.

2017
02:23:54,480 --> 02:23:55,480
Well, we did get one person.

2018
02:23:55,480 --> 02:23:56,480
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2019
02:23:56,480 --> 02:24:14,480
Well anyways, the thing I was working on before. See, before when I was playing around with this program called RPG Maker 2003, the thing that I didn't like about it the most was having to draw all the, like, sprite graphics and stuff, and that really kind of frustrated me because I had really good ideas, but I didn't want to have to draw everything because that takes way too much time.

2020
02:24:14,480 --> 02:24:16,480
I hate drawing too. I'm just not good at it.

2021
02:24:16,480 --> 02:24:21,600
Especially since plotting out an RPG is like way too much work as it is.

2022
02:24:21,600 --> 02:24:27,960
So I figured I'd go ahead and play around the program some more because the mods for

2023
02:24:27,960 --> 02:24:30,400
Beats of Rage actually have sprites in them.

2024
02:24:30,400 --> 02:24:31,400
So that's kind of nice.

2025
02:24:31,400 --> 02:24:33,960
So I'm stealing those because I'm lazy.

2026
02:24:33,960 --> 02:24:37,240
So I am making an RPG.

2027
02:24:37,240 --> 02:24:38,240
It'll be fun.

2028
02:24:38,240 --> 02:24:39,240
Oh, wait.

2029
02:24:39,240 --> 02:24:40,240
Is that your new project?

2030
02:24:40,240 --> 02:24:41,240
That's my new project.

2031
02:24:41,240 --> 02:24:42,240
All right.

2032
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:44,120
But the best part.

2033
02:24:44,120 --> 02:24:45,120
We're in it.

2034
02:24:45,120 --> 02:24:46,120
Oh, great.

2035
02:24:46,120 --> 02:24:48,120
Wait, did you draw something?

2036
02:24:48,120 --> 02:24:52,120
As the collective groan arises from the studio.

2037
02:24:52,120 --> 02:24:54,120
DarkSucker, you look frightened by that.

2038
02:24:54,120 --> 02:24:56,120
I can draw, you know.

2039
02:24:56,120 --> 02:25:00,120
Well, I know, but I don't need you guys to draw anything.

2040
02:25:00,120 --> 02:25:02,120
Oh, you don't need us!

2041
02:25:02,120 --> 02:25:04,120
You don't need our help!

2042
02:25:04,120 --> 02:25:07,120
Fine! I hope your project sucks!

2043
02:25:07,120 --> 02:25:13,120
I figured out who the villain's going to be, but I can't say, because it's going to be funny. Trust me.

2044
02:25:13,120 --> 02:25:16,080
Yeah, I know who you would make the villain. You'd make the villain like

2045
02:25:16,080 --> 02:25:18,440
Rockstar or something. Anyway, we gotta call. No. What?

2046
02:25:18,440 --> 02:25:21,440
Bigger than Rockstar. Oh, boy. Here we go. Alright, we gotta call.

2047
02:25:21,440 --> 02:25:25,960
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

2048
02:25:25,960 --> 02:25:31,960
Okay. That's it! I go back to spamming the chatroom! Now you're not on Orange Lawn's radio.

2049
02:25:31,960 --> 02:25:35,320
So anyways, as I was talking about the game.

2050
02:25:35,320 --> 02:25:38,400
Well, F you too! I see how it is.

2051
02:25:38,400 --> 02:25:40,300
Great. Okay.

2052
02:25:40,300 --> 02:25:41,540
Think Kingdom Hearts

2053
02:25:41,540 --> 02:25:47,060
minus the Disney characters, and all the console characters, like a lot of console characters.

2054
02:25:47,060 --> 02:25:49,480
And just have random, like, you know, villains in it.

2055
02:25:49,480 --> 02:25:52,000
But there's one big villain that's in charge of everything.

2056
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:57,980
And he's the worst video game villain. It's Mr. Spanky, isn't it? No, it's not Mr. Spanky. Bigger.

2057
02:25:57,980 --> 02:26:00,380
Yeah, think bigger.

2058
02:26:00,380 --> 02:26:04,340
I don't know. I can't give it away, I'm not going to give any hints, only because it's hilarious.

2059
02:26:04,340 --> 02:26:05,280
Buggy-buggy!

2060
02:26:05,280 --> 02:26:08,180
And I've got another person making a cameo in this

2061
02:26:08,180 --> 02:26:10,180
who's related to

2062
02:26:10,180 --> 02:26:12,820
our show but not to be

2063
02:26:12,820 --> 02:26:18,140
we i can't i can't say i find it'll be funny trust me it's great i'm gonna work

2064
02:26:18,140 --> 02:26:20,500
on it but i can see it too much more about it does

2065
02:26:20,500 --> 02:26:25,180
al the follower finish it or get the uh... urge to actually work on itself

2066
02:26:25,180 --> 02:26:27,060
but i'm hopefully gonna have it done

2067
02:26:27,060 --> 02:26:29,340
you know within like a year

2068
02:26:29,340 --> 02:26:31,340
uh... i think you're

2069
02:26:31,340 --> 02:26:32,180
hey

2070
02:26:32,180 --> 02:26:36,140
i'm given clear job to do this full-time this is more important

2071
02:26:36,140 --> 02:26:38,140
It'll be cool when it's done, okay?

2072
02:26:38,140 --> 02:26:43,140
The walking around, like, overworld music needs to be, like, the Goonies' song.

2073
02:26:43,140 --> 02:26:48,140
There's gonna be evil characters in, like, I've already decided there's gonna be Evil Ken.

2074
02:26:48,140 --> 02:26:50,140
He's gonna be one of the characters you have to fight in it.

2075
02:26:50,140 --> 02:26:51,140
How about Evil Rob?

2076
02:26:51,140 --> 02:26:53,140
There's gonna be Emo Dan.

2077
02:26:53,140 --> 02:26:55,140
Like, Dan from Street Fighter?

2078
02:26:55,140 --> 02:26:56,140
Oh, I thought maybe, no.

2079
02:26:56,140 --> 02:26:58,140
Oh wait, Aji!

2080
02:26:58,140 --> 02:27:01,140
Cause he's kinda depressed as it is, so I thought that would be funny.

2081
02:27:01,140 --> 02:27:05,140
I'd like to see Emo Dan, who manages the GameStop.

2082
02:27:05,140 --> 02:27:11,140
I can make that character Dan. That's angry Dan who manages the gamestop. I know, that's why it's funny to be anal Dan.

2083
02:27:11,140 --> 02:27:21,140
It'll be funny, it'll have references from stuff, it'll have inside jokes, it'll be great, and it'll just have like, you know, fun stuff, you know.

2084
02:27:21,140 --> 02:27:28,140
Alright. Like, Dark Sakura will summon an attack that'll involve the gorillas, you know.

2085
02:27:28,140 --> 02:27:30,140
Yeah, the jeep comes running out.

2086
02:27:30,140 --> 02:27:32,140
Running out, run over whoever.

2087
02:27:32,140 --> 02:27:34,140
Your mic going crazy.

2088
02:27:34,140 --> 02:27:36,140
Yeah, I know what's up with that.

2089
02:27:36,140 --> 02:27:38,140
Alright.

2090
02:27:38,140 --> 02:27:40,140
Alright. Jamie, don't bother berating the chatroom.

2091
02:27:40,140 --> 02:27:42,140
We've got other things to get to.

2092
02:27:42,140 --> 02:27:44,140
We'll just...

2093
02:27:44,140 --> 02:27:46,140
They can be shy if they want. Actually, I think the person

2094
02:27:46,140 --> 02:27:48,140
who tried to call in was saying that their settings

2095
02:27:48,140 --> 02:27:50,140
were screwed up, but we'll open it up again.

2096
02:27:50,140 --> 02:27:52,140
I can't breathe.

2097
02:27:52,140 --> 02:27:54,140
After this, what, are you okay?

2098
02:27:54,140 --> 02:27:56,140
I can only breathe through one nostril.

2099
02:27:56,140 --> 02:27:59,740
it sounds like you're ready to do some venting aren't you.

2100
02:27:59,740 --> 02:28:04,260
So I think we need to get to the FUs of the week don't we?

2101
02:28:04,260 --> 02:28:10,720
So Dark Sakura why is it that we do the FUs of the week every single freaking

2102
02:28:10,720 --> 02:28:11,140
week

2103
02:28:11,140 --> 02:28:18,140
Grr ARG

2104
02:28:18,140 --> 02:28:31,140
Dude, I love my F.U. music now. It's Angel Stanatos from Silent Hill 2. It's, like, awesome.

2105
02:28:31,140 --> 02:28:38,140
Anyway, uh, my first F.U. goes to Dust. It goes to throwing away shit I wanted to keep,

2106
02:28:38,140 --> 02:28:44,640
except I'm too pack ratty. Uh, F.U. to Dust again. F.U. to my nostril being plugged on

2107
02:28:44,640 --> 02:28:57,920
one side um f you to food um f you to the pizza that i ate yesterday uh crap f you to

2108
02:28:57,920 --> 02:29:03,840
the 50 boxes sitting in my living room and the fact that my cat is afraid of everything now

2109
02:29:04,720 --> 02:29:08,480
she's been living in her litter box since we started moving all those boxes downstairs

2110
02:29:08,480 --> 02:29:14,160
and why the fuck do i have so much stuff i swear i trip it over controllers and video

2111
02:29:14,160 --> 02:29:20,980
game systems and the cat and like RC cars we found our initial DRC car. You didn't pack

2112
02:29:20,980 --> 02:29:25,740
Shermie did you? No, Shermie will pack herself in her litter box until we're

2113
02:29:25,740 --> 02:29:30,020
moved. Then at the point that we are at the new location she will proceed to

2114
02:29:30,020 --> 02:29:35,420
live in her litter box for a week like she did the last two times. Shermie has

2115
02:29:35,420 --> 02:29:40,340
been with us through one move already. She knows things. She knows this is a

2116
02:29:40,340 --> 02:29:44,340
this strange place that dogs used to live at. Oh yeah, I'm probably going to have to

2117
02:29:44,340 --> 02:29:50,480
endure a couple of weeks worth of allergies from chows and cigarette smoke that used to

2118
02:29:50,480 --> 02:29:56,800
reside in the house. They had smoking dogs. No, but he, well I know he stopped smoking

2119
02:29:56,800 --> 02:30:03,200
once the baby was born. Which is good, but it's still in the house and it still stinks.

2120
02:30:03,200 --> 02:30:07,000
You know I saw this thing today in the magazine at the haircut place where Shane went where

2121
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:11,000
where it was showing pregnant celebrities like Britney Spears and stuff

2122
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:15,000
uh... who's the other one? It was Britney Spears and one of the other ones

2123
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:18,000
Baby Killers! And it showed their smoking husbands

2124
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
Baby Killers! Right in front of them

2125
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
Where do you have the ones that actually do smoke themselves?

2126
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
Britney was smoking while she was pregnant

2127
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
Well she didn't know she was pregnant, right?

2128
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:27,000
No, she was pregnant

2129
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:28,000
What a dumbass!

2130
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
She's a stupid bitch, I'm sorry

2131
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:31,000
Anyway

2132
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:35,000
She can't have a smart baby because how else will they grow up to be a pop singer?

2133
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:40,000
Sorry to derail that, I'm sorry.

2134
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
Back to you and your friends.

2135
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
I'm done.

2136
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:45,000
Fuck you, baby killer!

2137
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:50,000
Alright, let's go to Loki.

2138
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
Loki to my stomach for being empty.

2139
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:56,000
I want food, and I don't have food, so I gotta, you know, find food at home,

2140
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
which I'm sure we don't have food there either.

2141
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
I have some damn in the kitchen.

2142
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
I don't want any damn.

2143
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:08,000
Damn, by the way, is D-A-I-M, and it's little miniature heat barks. Delicious, I gotta go to that queue.

2144
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:37,280
still smell them on me after I've brushed my teeth a few times and washed my hands repeatedly.

2145
02:31:37,280 --> 02:31:43,400
They still smell like onion. It's like it's just toxic or something and I don't know what

2146
02:31:43,400 --> 02:31:57,400
to do. And that's about it. My turn. I want to give it a F-you to Nintendo for fucking

2147
02:31:57,400 --> 02:32:01,760
being a bunch of dicks in WarioWare Twisted and putting in that Kid Icarus record and

2148
02:32:01,760 --> 02:32:06,440
saying haha this is the closest thing you're going to get to a sequel wahaha I hate you

2149
02:32:06,440 --> 02:32:10,400
and I'm not going to buy any of your crapy products ever again except nintendo because

02:32:48,940 --> 02:32:58,840

2157
02:32:58,840 --> 02:33:04,120

2158
02:33:04,120 --> 02:33:10,960
FU to general work angst. That's alright. FU to trance music. There we go. Generic boring

2159
02:33:10,960 --> 02:33:12,820
trans music

2160
02:33:12,820 --> 02:33:13,760
they get you that

2161
02:33:13,760 --> 02:33:15,620

2162
02:33:15,620 --> 02:33:18,940

02:33:21,340 --> 02:33:22,960
fuck you too

2166
02:33:22,960 --> 02:33:25,580
three hundred-pound six at wal-mart

2167
02:33:25,580 --> 02:33:29,260

2168
02:33:29,260 --> 02:33:32,060

2169
02:33:32,060 --> 02:33:32,700
all right

2170
02:33:32,700 --> 02:33:36,000
let's go to the chair of the two at the same

2171
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,460
uh... tomorrow says

2172
02:33:38,460 --> 02:33:47,420
FU to crayons. Why? Why not? I happen to like crayons, personally. This tastes like purple!

2173
02:33:47,420 --> 02:33:53,540
Uh, let's see. That's not an FU. That's not an FU. You guys are sending me personal messages.

2174
02:33:53,540 --> 02:33:58,380
Dark Knight says, my FU goes to this weekend. Be short. I didn't, I so didn't want it to

2175
02:33:58,380 --> 02:34:06,380
end. I agree, the weekend's been short. Um, Misty says, my first FU is to cage match.

2176
02:34:06,380 --> 02:34:10,940
to work because we have whoppers on sales for 99 cents tomorrow. Not that she's hiding

2177
02:34:10,940 --> 02:34:15,140
where she works or anything. I may rant about this more in that F.U. thread in the forums

2178
02:34:15,140 --> 02:34:19,260
in my live journal when I get home tomorrow. That's what live journal is for. Thank you

2179
02:34:19,260 --> 02:34:24,660
for recognizing what live journal is for. StupidBaka says, an F.U. to some random guy

2180
02:34:24,660 --> 02:34:29,580
that almost hit me on Friday while I was walking to City College for class. He almost hit me

2181
02:34:29,580 --> 02:34:34,020
and even dared to yell, get out of the way, you fucking punk. So of course I got out of

2182
02:34:34,020 --> 02:34:38,020
the way and when he drives like half a block and stops to look back at me saying watch

2183
02:34:38,020 --> 02:34:42,700
for cars, dumbass. So of course I flip him the bird and yell at him to watch his shit

2184
02:34:42,700 --> 02:34:49,220
cause I scratched his car in a lightning bolt. What? I scratched his car in a lightning bolt?

2185
02:34:49,220 --> 02:34:56,220
That doesn't make sense. So yeah, fuck you to drivers. Dark Tetsuya says F you to myself

2186
02:34:56,220 --> 02:35:03,060
I fried my Playstation by dropping it. Whoops. You know I fried my Gamecube because I was

2187
02:35:03,060 --> 02:35:08,060
I was trying to play WarioWare Twisted and the Game Boy Player and it just, it wasn't working.

2188
02:35:08,060 --> 02:35:13,060
Doops says, F you to Orlando being so damn far from where I live.

2189
02:35:13,060 --> 02:35:18,060
And F you to Drawn Together for making Gay Link funny.

2190
02:35:18,060 --> 02:35:23,060
Short F you list today. Cause Xander was Gay Link.

2191
02:35:23,060 --> 02:35:28,060
Didn't that show come on like 8 months ago and hasn't done anything since?

2192
02:35:28,060 --> 02:35:31,860
or just a little slow. It's all right. Maybe the DVDs just came out or something. I don't

2193
02:35:31,860 --> 02:35:39,500
know. Maybe. I don't know. I would get on that. No. Apparently not. So. I totally would

2194
02:35:39,500 --> 02:35:47,220
buy drawn together DVDs. That's awesome. All right. We will go ahead and open up the Skype

2195
02:35:47,220 --> 02:35:50,840
line one more time. Give it a try. See if we get any calls. You can give us a call over

2196
02:35:50,840 --> 02:35:56,600
or on www.orangelaungeradio.com, click on interact with us.

2197
02:35:56,600 --> 02:35:59,440
In the meantime, one thing I wanted to bring up

2198
02:35:59,440 --> 02:36:03,980
was a way you can help us, actually.

2199
02:36:03,980 --> 02:36:06,720
And now I can't remember where the site was.

2200
02:36:06,720 --> 02:36:11,800
Oh yes, it's podcastawards.com.

2201
02:36:11,800 --> 02:36:14,400
And we're trying to get ourselves nominated.

2202
02:36:14,400 --> 02:36:17,120
Because originally I wasn't going to push for this one

2203
02:36:17,120 --> 02:36:20,820
because there was just a general technology category.

2204
02:36:20,820 --> 02:36:25,220
And there's no point, because Leo Laporte in This Week in Tech would just

2205
02:36:25,220 --> 02:36:27,700
whoop everybody's ass, so there's really no point, right?

2206
02:36:27,700 --> 02:36:29,060
So we were just not even gonna try.

2207
02:36:29,060 --> 02:36:33,900
But now, in going to podcastawards.com, we find that they have

2208
02:36:33,900 --> 02:36:37,540
added a new category for best gaming podcast.

2209
02:36:39,620 --> 02:36:41,620
So- I cast a spell.

2210
02:36:41,620 --> 02:36:47,180
So vote your conscience, but remember that we like people who help us out.

2211
02:36:47,180 --> 02:36:50,580
So go to podcasting, is it podcasting?

2212
02:36:50,580 --> 02:36:56,120
podcastawards.com all one word and click on the big nominate now by the way it's

2213
02:36:56,120 --> 02:37:00,140
the very last category listed on the page way in the bottom right gaming and

2214
02:37:00,140 --> 02:37:04,980
just fill that in you just put your email address orange lounge radio to go

2215
02:37:04,980 --> 02:37:09,540
and our website and the XML and any other comments you want if you don't

2216
02:37:09,540 --> 02:37:12,300
know the XML I will post that information in the chat room in a little

2217
02:37:12,300 --> 02:37:17,540
bit so we appreciate all your help because we like getting stuff it's cool

2218
02:37:17,540 --> 02:37:23,060
like awards I'm doing it right now and I'm hoping that the podcast awards are

2219
02:37:23,060 --> 02:37:27,100
actually filled with chocolate or something because that would be cool

2220
02:37:27,100 --> 02:37:30,580
like if the podcasting awards were actually made out of like solid milk

2221
02:37:30,580 --> 02:37:34,400
chocolate or something and I could eat it that would be yummy or made out of

2222
02:37:34,400 --> 02:37:39,820
damn that'd be great all right we're gonna go to another break and we come

2223
02:37:39,820 --> 02:37:44,500
back from this break we're gonna do some ask orange lounge that's right send in

2224
02:37:44,500 --> 02:37:49,140

2225
02:37:49,140 --> 02:37:58,180
over the show and ask us any questions that you want. All right. So we will be back after

2226
02:37:58,180 --> 02:38:02,220
this break. And in this break, I think we need to hear some para para because I'm feeling

2227
02:38:02,220 --> 02:38:06,620
a little sluggish here and I want to wake up. I need to wake up a little bit here. So

2228
02:38:06,620 --> 02:38:10,300
we'll start it off with Jamie's request here and we'll be back with more Orange Lounge

2229
02:38:10,300 --> 02:38:13,560
Radio. For those of you guys in chat, I will post more information on how to vote for us

2230
02:38:13,560 --> 02:38:20,560
on PodcastWords. We'll be back after this.

2231
02:38:43,560 --> 02:38:47,060
It's a long night, and the fucking sun's all coming down

2232
02:38:47,060 --> 02:38:49,060
It's a long night

2233
02:39:01,060 --> 02:39:05,560
Hurry up my little guy, everyone is getting all the secrets, baby

2234
02:39:07,060 --> 02:39:11,560
Come on baby, come on boy, won't you really be the only one in this doggy hole?

2235
02:39:11,560 --> 02:39:18,560
Bellfire, bellfire, sticking together with you Dancing, dancing, you gotta move, you're moving

Please don't fight

2243
02:40:08,560 --> 02:40:10,560
Give it all back

2244
02:40:10,560 --> 02:40:12,560
Go, go, go, go, go!

2245
02:40:24,560 --> 02:40:27,560
This music makes you feel higher and

2246
02:40:27,560 --> 02:40:30,560
It's breathing deep, we're into the sun

2247
02:40:30,560 --> 02:40:33,560
Just move your head and get me higher and

2248
02:40:33,560 --> 02:40:36,560
Night is only me and you

2249
02:40:36,560 --> 02:40:39,560
I need to touch your body, touch your body

2250
02:41:09,560 --> 02:41:11,960
I'd like to tell the world you're a big girl

2251
02:41:11,960 --> 02:41:13,560
We got to let them go

2252
02:41:25,560 --> 02:41:27,160
Give it all back

2253
02:41:29,160 --> 02:41:31,160
I'm on my own

2254
02:41:31,160 --> 02:41:59,160
Welcome to the rock'n'roll, welcome to the famous hit or night

2255
02:41:59,160 --> 02:42:04,160
Come on, lady, come on, girl Come on, lady, girl, you have to write

2256
02:42:04,160 --> 02:42:12,160
Not the danger, not the best stranger Rock it, rock it, I can't help you at all

2257
02:42:12,160 --> 02:42:16,160
I'll also make my name, I'll make it if you know how

2258
02:42:16,160 --> 02:42:19,160
I'd like to be your president

2259
02:42:19,160 --> 02:42:25,160
Night's on fire, you better, better think You better, better forget the phrase to say

2260
02:42:55,160 --> 02:43:23,160
I got something really happy just to tell You I got something really happy just to tell

2261
02:43:23,160 --> 02:43:26,160
I got somethin' really happy just to tell you, baby

2262
02:43:26,160 --> 02:43:28,160
Look at the sun, I don't even know

2263
02:43:29,160 --> 02:43:32,160
Ready to dive into the trail, but together

2264
02:43:32,160 --> 02:43:34,160
All you girls can dance

2265
02:43:34,160 --> 02:43:35,160
It's funny, I know

2266
02:43:35,160 --> 02:43:37,160
Preaching the mixing star

2267
02:43:37,160 --> 02:43:38,160
With fire, fire

2268
02:43:38,160 --> 02:43:40,160
We just can't change the taste

2269
02:43:40,160 --> 02:43:42,160
We've got some music that we make

2270
02:43:42,160 --> 02:43:45,160
Sing a song with me, oh, sorry

2271
02:43:45,160 --> 02:43:48,160
Wanna get some chicken in the lake, oh, sorry

2272
02:43:48,160 --> 02:43:51,160
Like a girl from the fun, oh, sorry

2273
02:43:51,160 --> 02:43:53,660
Can you hear me now, it's time to rise

2274
02:43:53,660 --> 02:43:57,160
It's my new day, do you know, I'm falling

2275
02:43:57,160 --> 02:43:59,660
All you can see me in the dark

2276
02:43:59,660 --> 02:44:02,160
I'm taking time like a bird from Japan

2277
02:44:02,160 --> 02:44:03,660
I'm falling

2278
02:44:03,660 --> 02:44:06,160
Can you hear me now, it's time to rise

2279
02:44:06,160 --> 02:44:31,160
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

2280
02:44:31,160 --> 02:44:33,160
Do we want to be accepted by Hollywood?

2281
02:44:33,160 --> 02:44:35,160
No!

2282
02:44:35,160 --> 02:44:37,160
Do we care what people think of us?

2283
02:44:37,160 --> 02:44:39,160
No!

2284
02:44:39,160 --> 02:44:41,160
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

2285
02:44:41,160 --> 02:44:43,160
Yeah!

2286
02:44:45,160 --> 02:44:51,160
Extreme Bimani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

2287
02:44:51,160 --> 02:44:53,160
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2288
02:44:53,160 --> 02:44:59,160
Loki, I found more information on that thing you were brought up earlier about in the groove and the whole crash thing.

2289
02:44:59,160 --> 02:45:02,960
It's actually in a story that was posted over on ddrfreak.com.

2290
02:45:02,960 --> 02:45:09,500
It talks about the game will crash on auto-load, basically corrupting a player's saved game.

2291
02:45:09,500 --> 02:45:17,200
All you have to do, if the top grade sorting order is deselected as the default sort order,

2292
02:45:17,200 --> 02:45:19,080
then the game crashes.

2293
02:45:19,080 --> 02:45:21,760
So that's how to do it, if you want to crash your game.

2294
02:45:21,760 --> 02:45:23,920
So, just thought I'd share that with you.

2295
02:45:23,920 --> 02:45:27,400
I know you're too busy playing WarioWare to give a shit, but I just thought I'd share.

2296
02:45:27,400 --> 02:45:29,400
Nah, I heard her, brother.

2297
02:45:57,400 --> 02:46:04,400
There's Pump Up The Volume on Tuesday night, although this week, I may not be able to do a show.

2298
02:46:04,400 --> 02:46:07,400
It depends. If I do, I'll play a bunch of comedy.

2299
02:46:07,400 --> 02:46:11,400
But usually I play whatever. If you're hanging out in the chat room, you can request whatever.

2300
02:46:11,400 --> 02:46:14,400
It starts with a pre-show at a quarter to seven Pacific time.

2301
02:46:14,400 --> 02:46:18,400
The show starts at 7.30 to 10.30, and it's really random every time.

2302
02:46:18,400 --> 02:46:24,400
If you want to hear something new, unusual, something you might not normally listen to, check it out.

2303
02:46:24,400 --> 02:46:34,060
Alright, sounds good. In the Groove, of course, since it made its recent debut on the PlayStation

2304
02:46:34,060 --> 02:46:39,480
2, it's kind of getting some media coverage and some press coverage out there. One of

2305
02:46:39,480 --> 02:46:43,760
the websites that actually covered it was Wired News, you know, Wired, the magazine,

2306
02:46:43,760 --> 02:46:47,880
very respected tech magazine out there, actually did an article on In the Groove. If you're

2307
02:46:47,880 --> 02:46:54,360
curious for the link, it's located on www.orangelaungeradio.com. It's on the front page, a link there.

2308
02:46:54,360 --> 02:46:58,920
there to the Wired news story and it's kind of neat because it it compares the

2309
02:46:58,920 --> 02:47:03,800
games DDR and in the groove and kind of talks about you know how the games are

2310
02:47:03,800 --> 02:47:07,040
different it's kind of interesting because the only people that won't say

2311
02:47:07,040 --> 02:47:11,920
that in the groove is kind of a loose adaptation of DDR or whatever is rock

2312
02:47:11,920 --> 02:47:16,680
sore and red octane themselves they just kind of ignore it there but they post a

2313
02:47:16,680 --> 02:47:18,840
nice review and that's kind of interesting that it actually gets

2314
02:47:18,840 --> 02:47:25,840
coverage in Wired magazine. I like that. What are you giggling at over there, Loki?

2315
02:47:25,840 --> 02:47:31,640
I was playing one level of the WarioWare and I got to like level 60 and the music got so

2316
02:47:31,640 --> 02:47:38,040
fast it was funny. I was doing the hamster ED thing and that was fun. I'm glad you were

2317
02:47:38,040 --> 02:47:42,220
able to do that. The only one I could probably rock at is the one where you have to hold

2318
02:47:42,220 --> 02:47:49,220
it still, so you just leave your Game Boy Advance just sitting there.

2319
02:47:49,220 --> 02:47:53,220
What if it requires you to have it at a certain angle?

2320
02:47:53,220 --> 02:47:57,740
I don't think that's the case, but I'll try it.

2321
02:47:57,740 --> 02:48:01,980
One other plug I want to get in regards to In the Groove stories, and I know we have

2322
02:48:01,980 --> 02:48:05,420
a listener that writes for this website, and he actually wrote this review, so he'll like

2323
02:48:05,420 --> 02:48:13,180
and I'm giving this a plug, but honestly, insidepulse.com, specifically games.insidepulse.com,

2324
02:48:13,180 --> 02:48:17,640
they actually posted a review by one of our listeners, El Mullet, who writes for this

2325
02:48:17,640 --> 02:48:25,420
website, did a review of In the Groove, and in my opinion, this freaking sums it up perfectly.

2326
02:48:25,420 --> 02:48:31,620
This is honestly, like, the best review. This would be exactly how I feel about the game.

2327
02:48:31,620 --> 02:48:36,180
I think there was one or two things I disagreed with, but it's almost 100% exactly how I feel

2328
02:48:36,180 --> 02:48:37,180
about the game.

2329
02:48:37,180 --> 02:48:38,180
And it's fair.

2330
02:48:38,180 --> 02:48:41,660
It talks about what is good about In the Groove and what's not so good about In the Groove

2331
02:48:41,660 --> 02:48:42,740
and all that.

2332
02:48:42,740 --> 02:48:45,180
Check it out if you're curious insidepulse.com.

2333
02:48:45,180 --> 02:48:46,260
I totally endorse it.

2334
02:48:46,260 --> 02:48:48,260
I think it's a great review.

2335
02:48:48,260 --> 02:48:51,740
Let's go and go to the Skype line because we actually just got a call on Skype.

2336
02:48:51,740 --> 02:48:54,940
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2337
02:48:54,940 --> 02:48:57,140
This is your resident Ninja Spy Dark Knight.

2338
02:48:57,140 --> 02:48:59,620
Hello, our Ninja Spy Dark Knight.

2339
02:48:59,620 --> 02:49:01,620
What is on your mind tonight?

2340
02:49:01,620 --> 02:49:03,620
Nothing much, just a little bit tired.

2341
02:49:03,620 --> 02:49:08,620
Just got back from the convention around town this weekend.

2342
02:49:08,620 --> 02:49:12,620
You sound a little drained, like you just went to a convention or something.

2343
02:49:12,620 --> 02:49:15,620
You sound a little out of it, but that's alright. How was the convention?

2344
02:49:15,620 --> 02:49:17,620
Oh, it was pretty good actually.

2345
02:49:17,620 --> 02:49:20,620
I went to see the cosplay for the first time.

2346
02:49:20,620 --> 02:49:23,620
There was a pretty interesting cosplay skit that was going on at the convention.

2347
02:49:23,620 --> 02:49:25,620
Now which convention is this?

2348
02:49:25,620 --> 02:49:27,620
Anime Mid-Atlantic.

2349
02:49:27,620 --> 02:49:30,640
made in atlantic alright so what what kind of stuff where they do it at this

2350
02:49:30,640 --> 02:49:34,380
convention or the big shows the big things to see

2351
02:49:34,380 --> 02:49:37,880
uh... well i'd like that during the cosplay there was one skit they had they

2352
02:49:37,880 --> 02:49:40,340
have one skit had on there which was like

2353
02:49:40,340 --> 02:49:43,160
uh... final fantasy bit where they had

2354
02:49:43,160 --> 02:49:47,020
a black mage a white mage and warrior fighting the tome berry

2355
02:49:47,020 --> 02:49:49,080
and it was hilarious it was like

2356
02:49:49,080 --> 02:49:50,840
of course a typical tome berry

2357
02:49:50,840 --> 02:49:51,800
when you attack it

2358
02:49:51,800 --> 02:49:54,860
it's almost impossible to get a single hit off of it

2359
02:49:54,860 --> 02:49:58,420
and it was just getting hilarious every time it was killing everybody off and everybody like that

2360
02:49:58,420 --> 02:49:59,160
at the end

2361
02:49:59,160 --> 02:50:01,180
you see a guy come out holding a sign saying

2362
02:50:01,180 --> 02:50:04,340
tom berry gains like five thousand experience

2363
02:50:04,340 --> 02:50:08,580
five hundred forty gil and get pizza times four. Did the tom berry do the little final

2364
02:50:08,580 --> 02:50:11,880
fantasy victory dance that they did in final fantasy where they just raise their arms

2365
02:50:11,880 --> 02:50:14,540
up repeatedly? Yeah. Oh that's awesome. Yeah

2366
02:50:14,540 --> 02:50:16,100
it was great

2367
02:50:16,100 --> 02:50:17,740
but and there was one

2368
02:50:17,740 --> 02:50:22,300
cosplay that was very that was really really good and

2369
02:50:22,300 --> 02:50:27,660
beautifully performed. I wish I knew what it was, but let me put it this way, it involved

2370
02:50:27,660 --> 02:50:33,620
a lot of people and flag waving displays, and it was beautifully done. And I don't know

2371
02:50:33,620 --> 02:50:37,820
if it might have won or not, but apparently it was great.

2372
02:50:37,820 --> 02:50:40,900
Maybe there'll be pictures on the internet at some point or something so you can share

2373
02:50:40,900 --> 02:50:47,000
that with us later. Hey, I gotta ask, because no anime convention is incomplete without

2374
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:50,300
a hentai room. Was there a hentai room?

2375
02:50:50,300 --> 02:50:58,520
No, actually, unfortunately not, but yeah, when they had the raid portion, yeah, the

2376
02:50:58,520 --> 02:51:02,360
emergency list kind of started piling up as the raid went on during the night.

2377
02:51:02,360 --> 02:51:03,600
I see, I see.

2378
02:51:03,600 --> 02:51:07,320
So anything else you want to share about the convention?

2379
02:51:07,320 --> 02:51:12,160
Well, at the end of the convention, the last day was today, there was a big announcement

2380
02:51:12,160 --> 02:51:14,760
about where they were going next year.

2381
02:51:14,760 --> 02:51:19,380
Apparently they actually are going to go to they actually go to a big convention hall

2382
02:51:19,940 --> 02:51:22,900
anime mid-atlantic next year will be at the Richmond Convention Center

2383
02:51:23,420 --> 02:51:30,100
Okay, now no this now no, I think AMA is mostly like a local small con that's hosting a hotel

2384
02:51:30,100 --> 02:51:35,720
But apparently it gotten so popular now that they decided on moving to the convention center, which is huge

2385
02:51:35,720 --> 02:51:41,940
In fact when the announcement came down the whole audience erupted when I heard that announcement now

2386
02:51:41,940 --> 02:51:47,440
Now I'm not very familiar with the mid-Atlantic landmarks, but I can imagine if you were doing

2387
02:51:47,440 --> 02:51:50,840
your convention in a hotel lobby, and then someone said, hey, we're moving to the big

2388
02:51:50,840 --> 02:51:51,840
convention center.

2389
02:51:51,840 --> 02:51:53,780
That's pretty cool, because that lets you know you made it.

2390
02:51:53,780 --> 02:51:55,160
So that's great.

2391
02:51:55,160 --> 02:51:57,960
Good job.

2392
02:51:57,960 --> 02:52:04,880
And now I'm hoping we might have good news that we might have a travel budget someday.

2393
02:52:04,880 --> 02:52:08,920
So hopefully one of these days at least one of us will be able to come out there or something,

2394
02:52:08,920 --> 02:52:09,920
do something.

2395
02:52:09,920 --> 02:52:10,920
We'll see.

2396
02:52:10,920 --> 02:52:15,320
It's a pretty cool convention. You meet some great guests.

2397
02:52:15,320 --> 02:52:20,480
In fact, one of the most voiced artists is actually a local guy who you might have heard of.

2398
02:52:20,480 --> 02:52:26,280
If you remember some of his shows, Greg Ayers actually comes to the convention every time and he's a local guy.

2399
02:52:26,280 --> 02:52:28,000
And what's he known for?

2400
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:33,720
He plays Son Goku in Sayuki, if I'm pronouncing that anime right.

2401
02:52:33,720 --> 02:52:37,400
And he also does a whole bunch of stuff in ADV.

2402
02:52:37,400 --> 02:52:41,220
most of all the big shows big enemies that they have out there he done our

2403
02:52:41,220 --> 02:52:42,420
voice works for most of them

2404
02:52:42,420 --> 02:52:46,700
you might have heard his voice once or twice on Evangelion maybe as well

2405
02:52:46,700 --> 02:52:49,980
oh wow I try not to watch that Ava dubbed

2406
02:52:49,980 --> 02:52:54,100
but he's like I said he's pretty good

2407
02:52:54,100 --> 02:52:57,580
he's like one of the main people out of ADV

2408
02:52:57,580 --> 02:53:00,620
and like I said it's a surprise who is it again?

2409
02:53:00,620 --> 02:53:04,420
who was it again? Greg Ayers

2410
02:53:04,420 --> 02:53:09,000
Okay, I don't know why for a moment. I had somebody else someone else's name stuck in my head

2411
02:53:09,560 --> 02:53:13,960
But like I said, he's a local and like I said for him to blow up like that is great

2412
02:53:13,960 --> 02:53:20,000
And to see a local guy actually succeed like that and it's really really cool. He's actually met him. He's really cool guy

2413
02:53:20,280 --> 02:53:26,640
So like I said, I mean, I like it. I love his work and I hope he does a lot more. I'll say that way

2414
02:53:27,160 --> 02:53:34,000
All right, very cool. Well, congratulations that the con was a big success and who knows hopefully we can come out to one of those

2415
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:37,200
cons one of these days we'll see we gotta let you go cuz we're gonna get some

2416
02:53:37,200 --> 02:53:40,660

2420
02:53:57,080 --> 02:54:00,120
all for supporting other life these five stations just don't forget about us

2421
02:54:00,120 --> 02:54:05,120
that's all I ask. Oh, trust me, I won't. If you like anime and stuff, check it out.

2422
02:54:05,120 --> 02:54:10,120
Sounds good, check it out then. I think internet radio is where it's at, so definitely listen to

2423
02:54:10,120 --> 02:54:15,120
internet radio stations including us and Anime Mid-Atlantic and whatever tickles your

2424
02:54:15,120 --> 02:54:20,120
fancy. Alright, y'all guys have a good night. Alright, you too. Have a good one.

2425
02:54:20,120 --> 02:54:25,120
Just in case anyone out there is playing WarioWare Twisted, you want to know what it sounds like on level

2426
02:54:25,120 --> 02:54:32,120
level 150

2427
02:54:32,400 --> 02:54:35,760
that's lovely thank you i'm gonna come over there and shake that

2428
02:54:35,760 --> 02:54:40,400
i'm playing the do not move one and it's so easy to win because you just

2429
02:54:40,400 --> 02:54:44,080
to set it down and you know i actually got up to about i think it was like three

2430
02:54:44,080 --> 02:54:45,800
hundred and fifty one

2431
02:54:45,800 --> 02:54:49,800
and it was on uh... warrior where for the game cube and it was the metroid

2432
02:54:49,800 --> 02:54:52,960
missile one all you had to do is hit the a button as fast as you can and shoot

2433
02:54:52,960 --> 02:54:54,580
missiles to kill mother brain

2434
02:54:54,580 --> 02:54:59,580
That was the minigame. For those of you guys that don't know WarioWare, it's just a bunch of minigames thrown together.

2435
02:54:59,580 --> 02:55:04,580
So, that was the whole concept, so to speak, I guess.

2436
02:55:04,580 --> 02:55:09,580
I got to, like, 350, and my fingers were practically starting to bleed,

2437
02:55:09,580 --> 02:55:14,580
because I just was whacking that button so much. The button! The button!

2438
02:55:16,580 --> 02:55:20,580
Let's go to some Ask Orange Lounge. We only got a few questions, that's alright, we don't have a lot of show left.

2439
02:55:20,580 --> 02:55:28,300
Whoa! That's not the right theme music. That's the Ask... That's the Ask... That's wedding chat!

2440
02:55:28,300 --> 02:55:37,100
That's the Ask Satan portion of the show. My bad, you guys. Sorry about that.

2441
02:55:37,100 --> 02:55:45,300
Marriage Talk with Cal Dracula. Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid

2442
02:55:45,300 --> 02:55:50,380
questions. What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio? It's a good

2443
02:55:50,380 --> 02:55:56,060
thing it's just dark sakura sky and low oki and not satan or else the theme music would

2444
02:55:56,060 --> 02:55:57,060
sound something like this

2445
02:55:57,060 --> 02:56:07,620
let's get to the questions

2446
02:56:07,620 --> 02:56:16,020
illusion wants to know in your guys opinions is gem truly truly truly outrageous

2447
02:56:16,020 --> 02:56:20,340
truly truly truly outrageous

2448
02:56:20,340 --> 02:56:24,060
well you know what and the misfits are bitter they're gonna get her

2449
02:56:24,060 --> 02:56:27,500
with the misfits their songs are better and they're gonna get her

2450
02:56:27,500 --> 02:56:31,620
the misfits were better people

2451
02:56:31,620 --> 02:56:37,540
ah misty wants to know does it still count as a hentai room

2452
02:56:37,540 --> 02:56:41,020
if it was only running from 2 to 7 a.m. on Saturday

2453
02:56:41,020 --> 02:56:45,260
and Sunday when most of the little kitties are asleep

2454
02:56:45,260 --> 02:56:48,580
It turns hentai and then changes back.

2455
02:56:48,580 --> 02:56:54,460
I think it works for me.

2456
02:56:54,460 --> 02:57:00,420
Hentai is hentai, people.

2457
02:57:00,420 --> 02:57:03,580
That's the important thing to remember.

2458
02:57:03,580 --> 02:57:05,200
Doobs wants to know...

2459
02:57:05,200 --> 02:57:06,940
Oh, I'm sorry, that was his FU.

2460
02:57:06,940 --> 02:57:10,940
Why does everyone hate Pump It Up slash In The Groove 2?

2461
02:57:10,940 --> 02:57:12,300
I don't really think it's

2462
02:57:12,300 --> 02:57:16,500
that bad of an idea. I'd like to play Pump It Up and In The Groove at the same time.

2463
02:57:16,500 --> 02:57:20,380
Okay, let me clarify something for you though, because I think this is gonna be a

2464
02:57:20,380 --> 02:57:21,620
common misconception.

2465
02:57:21,620 --> 02:57:25,820
With Pump It Up and In The Groove 2, you will not be able to play both games

2466
02:57:25,820 --> 02:57:30,380
at the same time. Think of it as a spin-off series, that basically In The

2467
02:57:30,380 --> 02:57:32,780
Groove is being absorbed into the Pump It Up series.

2468
02:57:32,780 --> 02:57:36,100
This does not mean that In The Groove will suddenly have five arrows or

2469
02:57:36,100 --> 02:57:38,300
whatever, and I don't know if you were misinterpreting this,

2470
02:57:38,300 --> 02:57:42,100
but I'm saying this in general for anybody who is thinking this way, just

2471
02:57:42,100 --> 02:57:46,780
in general. It's not suddenly going to mean that In the Groove turns into a five-arrow

2472
02:57:46,780 --> 02:57:50,760
dancing game. It doesn't mean any of that. It's just that it's a different game but they're

2473
02:57:50,760 --> 02:57:56,680
putting it out under the Pump It Up label. Such as, you know, I don't know, I'm trying

2474
02:57:56,680 --> 02:58:01,720
to think of a comparable example type thing. Whereas, you know, Diet Coke is not Coke but

2475
02:58:01,720 --> 02:58:04,320
it's under the Coke label. Does that make sense at all?

2476
02:58:04,320 --> 02:58:15,320
It's kind of like MTV2. See, MTV2 plays music videos, and MTV3 plays music videos, and MTV1 and 2.0.

2477
02:58:15,320 --> 02:58:16,320
The Ocho.

2478
02:58:18,320 --> 02:58:19,320
God, that is...

2479
02:58:20,320 --> 02:58:23,320
Yeah, it's just about their, you know, partnership with Animaro.

2480
02:58:23,320 --> 02:58:26,320
And they're actually going to get it in a good cabinet.

2481
02:58:26,320 --> 02:58:29,320
And to answer the other part of the question, why does everyone hate Pump It Up and The Groove 2,

2482
02:58:29,320 --> 02:58:34,320
I will defer that to Loki because he is the one that is most full of spite when it comes to those games, Loki.

2483
02:58:34,320 --> 02:58:38,320
Because it sucks. The first game sucked, the second one is going to suck as well.

2484
02:58:38,320 --> 02:58:40,320
What more do I need to ask?

2485
02:58:40,320 --> 02:58:45,320
I'm going to be a little hopeful for the second one just because I really like the Pump It Up cabinets.

2486
02:58:45,320 --> 02:58:53,320
Okay, we'll check out the brand new cabinets with their brand spanking new huge monitor.

2487
02:58:53,320 --> 02:58:55,320
They'll be like, wow, ugly graphics, but bigger.

2488
02:58:55,320 --> 02:59:00,320
Wait a minute. It sucks is the blandest description I've ever heard though. Why does it suck?

2489
02:59:00,320 --> 02:59:03,320
Why does it suck? The graphics suck.

2490
02:59:03,320 --> 02:59:08,320
Okay, the graphics are bland and horrible.

2491
02:59:08,320 --> 02:59:11,320
The gameplay is just lame.

2492
02:59:11,320 --> 02:59:16,320
It's basically, oh look, we copied DDR. It's a brand new game with really subpar graphics.

2493
02:59:16,320 --> 02:59:20,320
The interface we spent like two seconds actually designing.

2494
02:59:20,320 --> 02:59:24,320
You know, and the music, oh well, guess what, it sounds all the same.

2495
02:59:24,320 --> 02:59:27,320
And, you know, our step charts are way too damn hard.

2496
02:59:27,320 --> 02:59:28,320
How are you going to play them on a soft pad?

2497
02:59:28,320 --> 02:59:30,320
But, Loki, there's 12 and 13 footers in it.

2498
02:59:30,320 --> 02:59:32,320
Isn't that what the future of dance gaming is all about?

2499
02:59:32,320 --> 02:59:34,320
Oh, yeah, try that on a soft pad.

2500
02:59:34,320 --> 02:59:35,320
Yeah, yeah.

2501
02:59:35,320 --> 02:59:36,320
I was just curious.

2502
02:59:36,320 --> 02:59:38,320
Yeah, when you can't do, like, four footers on a soft pad,

2503
02:59:38,320 --> 02:59:40,320
yeah, 13 feet, that's going to rock.

2504
02:59:40,320 --> 02:59:42,320
Okay, yeah, well, that's where it's at.

2505
02:59:42,320 --> 02:59:43,320
I'm sorry.

2506
02:59:43,320 --> 02:59:46,320
All right.

2507
02:59:46,320 --> 02:59:49,320
I'm still, I say, in the groove.

2508
02:59:49,320 --> 02:59:52,320
It's not as good as the fanboys and girls say it is,

2509
02:59:52,320 --> 02:59:59,160
it is, but it's not as bad as Loki says it is either, or the haters say. It's just, it's

2510
02:59:59,160 --> 03:00:04,120
there. It's another dance game. It's fine. Whatever. For me it is kind of a holdover

2511
03:00:04,120 --> 03:00:10,120
until New DDR, honestly, which I hope will happen in the arcade someday. But I'm not

2512
03:00:10,120 --> 03:00:18,120
going to hold my breath. I hope. I hope those kinds of rumors are true. I really hope so.

2513
03:00:18,120 --> 03:00:21,800
Anyway, that's the end of the show. It's time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts,

2514
03:00:21,800 --> 03:00:26,720
Starting with Seagurd, Mieglatov, Shane, whatever the hell your name is.

2515
03:00:26,720 --> 03:00:31,800
Taco Bell has a new food item that's really good.

2516
03:00:31,800 --> 03:00:33,800
Loki.

2517
03:00:33,800 --> 03:00:38,920
I don't eat at Taco Bell because, you know, it looks like runny poop

2518
03:00:38,920 --> 03:00:40,720
and it gives you runny poop, so the end.

2519
03:00:46,640 --> 03:00:49,160
My final thought is, I want a Power Max.

2520
03:00:49,160 --> 03:00:50,880
Somebody give me $1,600.

2521
03:00:50,880 --> 03:00:56,280
And Loki, don't you open your mouth. I don't want to get into this discussion with you.

2522
03:00:56,280 --> 03:00:59,920
What exactly... What power would that have?

2523
03:00:59,920 --> 03:01:03,880
The power to crash. The power to run nothing.

2524
03:01:03,880 --> 03:01:06,400
The power to play no games.

2525
03:01:06,400 --> 03:01:09,760
I actually want... I actually want a G5.

2526
03:01:09,760 --> 03:01:13,080
Yeah. But I'm in the graphic art. I'm waiting for Loki to say something about,

2527
03:01:13,080 --> 03:01:18,040
you know, Macintoshes are the in the groove of the computer market or something.

2528
03:01:18,040 --> 03:01:25,280
I am actually thinking of saving up for a G5 tower, just because since my major is mostly

2529
03:01:25,280 --> 03:01:26,280
graphic based.

2530
03:01:26,280 --> 03:01:28,720
Look, look people, I want one because they're pretty, alright?

2531
03:01:28,720 --> 03:01:29,720
That's it.

2532
03:01:29,720 --> 03:01:30,720
I want one!

2533
03:01:30,720 --> 03:01:33,000
I have a legitimate reason for wanting one!

2534
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:34,640
You want one for aesthetic value?

2535
03:01:34,640 --> 03:01:37,640
No, I have real value for them.

2536
03:01:37,640 --> 03:01:43,280
I like the idea that they do the sound, I want things like GarageBand and those types

2537
03:01:43,280 --> 03:01:44,280
of programs.

2538
03:01:44,280 --> 03:01:45,560
I think they could answer some.

2539
03:01:45,560 --> 03:01:46,560
Yeah.

2540
03:01:46,560 --> 03:01:49,560
I just want Photoshop to be able to run decently.

2541
03:01:49,560 --> 03:01:55,560
And honestly, my work comes out a lot better using the G5 at school than using my PC.

2542
03:01:55,560 --> 03:01:58,560
Alright, DarkSakura, your final thought?

2543
03:01:58,560 --> 03:02:00,560
Reject false icons!

2544
03:02:00,560 --> 03:02:02,560
So that Britney Spears is on fire!

2545
03:02:02,560 --> 03:02:07,560
And the final word of the show, one word to sum everything up and let us know where we...

2546
03:02:07,560 --> 03:02:09,560
I gave it to you last week, didn't I, Seacred?

2547
03:02:09,560 --> 03:02:11,560
Alright, fine, you can have tonight's final word.

2548
03:02:11,560 --> 03:02:14,560
See you guys next week, thanks for listening, you guys.

2549
03:02:14,560 --> 03:02:19,560
And the final word of the show is hungry.

2550
03:02:19,560 --> 03:02:25,120
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

2555
03:02:43,760 --> 03:03:07,920
Now you say you never met my wife, you ain't never seen her before

2556
03:03:07,920 --> 03:03:12,800
Say you ain't been hangin' round my crib, well here's somethin' I wanna know

2557
03:03:12,800 --> 03:03:20,680
I wanna know what in the world is goin' down How come my dog don't bark when you come around?

2558
03:03:20,680 --> 03:03:27,520
I got the baddest dog, he'll bite anybody He bit my little brother, took a chunk out

2559
03:03:27,520 --> 03:03:33,680
of my old sweet little mother He bit the mailman, he sees him every day

2560
03:03:33,680 --> 03:03:38,240
He takes one look at you, he wanna jump up and play

2561
03:03:38,240 --> 03:03:42,240
Now I ain't got a clue as to what you puttin' down

2562
03:03:42,240 --> 03:03:47,240
But I come my dog, don't balk when you come around

2563
03:03:47,240 --> 03:03:52,240
My dog is dangerous, tryin' to set people free

2564
03:03:52,240 --> 03:03:56,240
Even bought a bad dog's fine and hung it on the gate

2565
03:03:56,240 --> 03:04:00,240
Here you come trippin' about a quarter to nine

2566
03:04:00,240 --> 03:04:05,240
Full of that nitrene wine tryin' to slide past the slide

2567
03:04:05,240 --> 03:04:09,240
My dog there knockin' off ain't read you no mind

2568
03:04:09,240 --> 03:04:14,240
That's my dog when I come home, he don't sleep that sound

2569
03:04:14,240 --> 03:04:18,240
How come my dog don't bark when you come around?

2570
03:04:18,240 --> 03:04:22,240
I still don't like it, I don't dig it one damn bit

2571
03:04:22,240 --> 03:04:26,240
The way you and my dog are so tight, somethin' don't fit

2572
03:04:26,240 --> 03:04:30,240
Now I slip through the alley, I call my dog

2573
03:04:30,240 --> 03:04:36,240
So get up off your rusty dust Move a little faster to your old master

2574
03:04:36,240 --> 03:04:40,240
Your Kai Yu Yu He took one look at me

2575
03:04:40,240 --> 03:04:50,240
He growled and he ran straight to you Now somebody's been confusing my whole hound

2576
03:04:50,240 --> 03:04:58,240
And I wanna know what's goin' down How come my dog don't bark when you come around?

2577
03:05:07,240 --> 03:05:15,240
Maybe I better call up Jacoby and Miles And you can take the Fifth Amendment, that is

2578
03:05:15,240 --> 03:05:21,240
Better stand up for your rights, cause you might not be standing too long

2579
03:05:21,240 --> 03:05:28,240
I'm gonna stop all this confusion, I'm gonna fire that hound, shoot that dog down

2580
03:05:28,240 --> 03:05:36,240
Then I'm gonna get busy mutilating, strangling, operating, and cremating my old lady

2581
03:05:36,240 --> 03:05:39,240
Down at the cremation station

2582
03:05:39,240 --> 03:05:43,240
Then I'm gonna torch that tooth and come right on after you

2583
03:05:43,240 --> 03:05:50,240
You'd give your heart and soul to charity And all the rest's gonna be a loan to me

2584
03:05:50,240 --> 03:05:54,240
I'm goin' straight down to that barber's supply shop

2585
03:05:54,240 --> 03:05:59,240
Gettin' a girl handy, double edged, high on the ground

2586
03:05:59,240 --> 03:06:08,240
Move a blue blade, adjustable stainless steel Horned edge, both blades on the same side

2587
03:06:08,240 --> 03:06:12,240
So when I cut you once, you gonna bleed twice

2588
03:06:12,240 --> 03:06:21,240
And if you don't believe me, shake your head, it'll be singin' I ain't got no vibe.

2589
03:06:21,240 --> 03:06:27,240
But one night I hit a little FBI 007 type investigation.

2590
03:06:27,240 --> 03:06:31,240
You and my old lady thought I was gone, but I wasn't gone.

2591
03:06:31,240 --> 03:06:35,240
That's why I had to separate you from your ground.

2592
03:06:35,240 --> 03:06:41,240
And the only sound you gonna hear when you six feet in the ground.

2593
03:06:41,240 --> 03:06:54,040
How come my dog didn't bark when you came around?

2594
03:06:54,040 --> 03:07:01,040
Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.

2595
03:07:24,040 --> 03:07:36,200
There we are. There's Mike. Alright. Rob, how come my cat don't meow when you come around?

2596
03:07:36,200 --> 03:07:42,160
I don't know honey, I don't know. Alright. Um, Loki, I promised the chatters I'd bring

2597
03:07:42,160 --> 03:07:45,640
this up to you because they started yelling this at me during the credits, but some folks

2598
03:07:45,640 --> 03:07:49,720
in the chat room say they can pass 11 footers on their home pads. And they're yelling at

2599
03:07:49,720 --> 03:07:56,080
saying you you suck to loki you are to suck we can pass yeah but what about

2600
03:07:56,080 --> 03:08:03,320
soft pads no there that somebody said my soft pad is modded on top of a plastic

2601
03:08:03,320 --> 03:08:09,160
card modded I'm sorry do it on an unmodded one and send us footage what

2602
03:08:09,160 --> 03:08:13,000
well what's that gonna prove us let's assume somewhere somebody has done it

2603
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:17,760
let's say what is that gonna prove no one can no one can do it on an unmodded

2604
03:08:17,760 --> 03:08:22,760
I think there's just no pleasing Loki, kids. That's just how it works. So, that's the best answer you're gonna get.

2605
03:08:22,760 --> 03:08:28,560
regular soft pad no what serious gamer plays on a regular soft pad though that's

2606
03:08:28,560 --> 03:08:32,440
what they sell them so that's what I did I haven't modded any of my pads yet then

2607
03:08:32,440 --> 03:08:36,800
again I did pay $80 for my Dreamcast ones all right all right there's just I

2608
03:08:36,800 --> 03:08:41,800
think there's just no pleasing Loki kids that's just how it works so that's the

2609
03:08:41,800 --> 03:08:45,320
best answer you're gonna get in the meantime we're signing out for the night

2610
03:08:45,320 --> 03:08:47,320
Thanks a lot for
