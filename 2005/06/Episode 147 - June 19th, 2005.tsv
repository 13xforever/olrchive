296313	297593	I'm badly animated today.
298894	299954	You're badly drawn today?
300054	301095	Yeah, I'm badly drawn.
301495	302536	You were just drawn that way?
302756	303376	Today I was.
304056	304516	Sorry to hear that.
304556	310059	I left the real me at home because she's currently packing up her entire life to the boonies of Citrus Heights.
311787	312348	Oh, okay.
312508	312808	Alright.
313268	313969	I've got a house.
314089	315430	I'm moving into a house for renting.
316311	318052	Therefore, I have no life for two weeks.
318993	319333	Fun!
319854	320274	Exactly.
320434	321215	I know what that's like.
321455	321875	Kinda.
321935	322196	Sort of.
323276	325138	Just recently, as we moved in the new studio.
325318	325558	Anyway.
326099	329041	Also joining us, the recently moved Loki!
329601	329862	Hi.
330891	331611	I just moved.
332292	333892	Yes, like, to the side.
334232	336213	You moved from the living room to the studio.
336233	337013	It was very nice.
337094	340615	Yeah, unfortunately I didn't move to the Pizza Hut to get myself dinner.
340795	342336	I knew something was missing.
343056	345337	I forgot, so I'm hungry now.
345537	346357	How could you forget pizza?
346417	346777	I have a salad.
346797	347498	How could you forget pizza?
347518	348678	Uh, no, I don't eat salad.
348878	349418	I'm sorry.
349839	351319	I'm a meatitarian, okay?
351359	352660	I don't touch that friggin' vegetables.
352680	353400	For salad, it has bacon bits.
353700	354761	It has bacon and chicken in it.
355181	356701	Yeah, but the bacon bits aren't real.
356941	358122	They aren't real bacon!
358894	360536	I'm eating this because my doctor told me to.
360556	363800	My doctor could tell me to eat salad all he wants and I'd be just like...
380276	387401	Yeah, but I don't want to be one of those 300-pound women that walk around in a muumuu scratching their ass in the middle of Walmart with five screaming children.
387702	388843	Dude, I saw that the other day.
389843	390444	Exactly.
390864	392025	That's not going to be me.
392065	394207	What are you doing in Walmart?
396428	397829	Just don't go to Walmart, Jamie.
399270	401032	But I don't want to wear the tent either.
402253	406496	Yeah, those women are the ones that shop for G-strings and shit, you know.
408486	410188	Go to work at a Walmart.
410208	410308	Never.
410328	410588	I'm sorry.
410628	411709	And he's not traumatized?
411729	414071	I just bit through my fork a moment ago.
414091	414451	It's crazy.
414471	415291	Look at my fork.
415371	415592	Anyway.
429987	437212	Moving on, special guest, say hello to, I never know what he wants to be called, but he's back here this week, Sigurd Miklatov.
437412	437832	Hi.
438073	438413	Whatever.
438733	439193	How you doing?
439513	441054	Good, playing Mario DS.
441315	443176	So, can you tell us anything new about the games yet?
443876	445938	Hey, Viazoic is in Ultimate 3.
445998	446678	Oh, great, thanks.
446758	448279	We were already going to get to that tonight.
449340	449680	Oops.
450200	453162	You know, if you told us last week, then it would have been an exclusive.
453563	455764	NDA, I can't tell you anything.
455784	456845	Hey, Spray last week.
457385	458266	Azoic This Week.
458386	460808	Okay, but you didn't tell us the spray thing.
460848	462330	Spray told us the spray thing.
462550	464531	Yeah, well, I was going to tell it too.
465212	465853	Sure you were.
467754	468055	Alright.
469135	475581	Well, Sigurd may say something tonight, but I don't know, he looks too enthralled with whatever he's playing on his brand new blue DS.
476502	477082	What are you playing?
477543	480646	I'm playing the crappy, actually the fun mini-games of Mario.
480966	481046	Oh.
481522	505699	Secret, by the way, for those of our folks who are new listeners to the show, he actually works at the Big K, Konami, and therefore, on one hand, it's really great to have him on the show, because, hey, who better to talk about DDR than somebody who works on DDR, but on the other hand, he can't tell a shit about DDR, because if they find out, you know, with the feds listening to the show and all, they'll find him and they'll beat him up, right?
506570	507130	Is that what happens?
507390	507971	Something like that.
507991	509551	What happens to people that violate NDAs?
510112	511552	Or would that be a violation of the NDAs?
511592	512853	They in turn become violated.
515314	517055	It's something like that, unfortunately.
517495	517655	Oh.
518535	519596	That sounds kind of exciting.
519616	521817	They're beaten by Simon Belmont's whip.
522057	522357	All right.
522597	523798	Anyway, let's get to a break.
523858	527820	We will go to a break and come back with a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.
528440	534382	The Azoic song we'll play for you guys tonight, as well as whatever else tickles our fancy.
534503	535303	Oh, how about this?
537459	541044	I always thought this was funny because you work at Konami yet you're a huge Pump It Up fan.
541564	542886	Let's not talk about that.
542946	544709	Oh, we're talking about it after this.
544769	548474	In this break, some old school DDR songs we haven't played in a while.
548494	549396	We'll be back after this.
551704	553485	Are you ready?
553505	554426	Ready for the race?
554606	555746	Are you ready?
556707	558248	Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh!
558408	559368	Are you ready?
559408	561469	Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh!
561549	562450	Are you ready?
563010	567092	No, we'll go round and round You hear the way you hear
606840	607263	Thank you.
633364	634348	Are you ready?
634589	636496	Ready for the race?
636717	637259	Are you ready?
725229	727311	If you can't say goodbye
789831	790899	Thank you for watching!
864614	865896	I'm going to step on the lamina.
865916	868901	Give us a reading on the 1202 programming.
924790	927994	After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move Marathon.
928294	930357	No!
930557	931218	Just kidding.
931639	932700	Orange Lounge Radio.
932780	934302	Crap-free Bavani Radio.
935166	936987	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
937007	939109	Thank you guys for tuning in tonight and listening to us.
939989	942251	In that break, you heard Ecstasy from Fifth Mix.
942291	945353	Before that, from Third Mix, if you can say goodbye by the Cape Project.
945833	948255	And before that, the Olivia Project with Xanadu.
948695	950957	I didn't realize I kind of put him that way, but that's all right.
951217	953198	And then starting that set off, a little bit of the Captain.
953499	955720	Captain Jack with The Race, also from Third Mix.
955880	958502	So a lot of Third Mix in that break, but hey, that's all right.
958542	959242	Third Mix rocked.
959363	959823	I mean, Third Mix...
960771	963333	Third Mix was kind of the peak of DDR in many ways.
963393	968477	At least a lot of folks that talk about the Japanese history of the game say it really peaked with Third Mix.
968557	971819	And I don't know, song list wise, I think Third Mix is one of the best.
971839	972400	It really is.
972600	974121	I'm thinking it's all about Fourth Plus.
974822	976363	Fourth Plus was pretty rad.
976383	978244	I mean, I think that would be kind of like the peak.
978264	979905	But everybody has their own argument.
979925	982287	And then there's people that say, no, no, no, Extreme's got the best.
982327	983168	No, no, no, no.
983688	984649	Second Mix for life.
984729	985069	Whatever.
985810	986450	Step Battle.
986490	987911	Hey, it's all about Step Battle.
987931	988752	Step Battle, yo.
988772	989292	I miss Step Battle.
989312	989813	Step Battle.
991263	991543	All right.
991563	993124	But I can play it at home on my Dreamcast.
993144	995804	Yeah, Sigurd, tell them to put Step Battle back in DDR.
996425	996925	Can you do that?
997245	998045	I'll get right on that.
998065	1001126	Because I know you actually write the games from scratch yourself.
1003407	1004627	With a pencil and paper.
1007288	1009929	And I put it on the CD and I kind of scroll it down.
1009949	1011490	That's real hand coding there.
1012170	1015071	Writing down the code and feeding it into a machine.
1015091	1015551	There you go.
1015811	1016611	In pencil.
1016691	1018612	And number two pencil on Scantron.
1020426	1022308	Is that how you guys do your dance steps?
1022368	1023269	It's on Scantron?
1024930	1028453	Yeah, but we actually use a blue ink pen instead of a number two.
1028893	1029093	Do you?
1029233	1030014	Oh, do you really?
1030034	1032596	No, you don't.
1032816	1033076	Do you?
1033256	1033617	No, we don't.
1033717	1034117	Oh, okay.
1034237	1035438	I was going to say, wait a minute.
1035458	1036058	No, you don't.
1038480	1040742	Stop sounding serious during segments like that.
1040842	1041323	Fine.
1041603	1041823	All right.
1043305	1044766	All right, anyway.
1044846	1047889	Here we are with another edition of Orange Lounge Radio Live.
1048150	1051793	You know, I noticed that we kind of had a hit in listeners lately.
1051853	1058759	I don't know if it's maybe it's summertime, so some of the folks that were listening to us in college dorms just decided to say, see ya, and aren't going to listen to the show anymore.
1060260	1062161	I noticed there's been quite a bit of a drop in listeners.
1062201	1063541	Let me put it in perspective for you guys.
1063901	1071764	About two months ago, at this time, we were at, our station as a whole was at 3,900 listening hours, as we say.
1071824	1077146	So that means 3,900 people listened for one hour each, or some people listened more or less.
1077486	1078266	It evens out to that.
1078806	1082087	Right now, we're looking at 2,700 listening hours.
1082127	1083988	We're taking a hit of almost a third of our listeners.
1084988	1086489	And I'm trying to think of why that is.
1086569	1087429	If it's because...
1088257	1096043	Just summertime blahs or the fact that we had that live 365 award thing earlier or if you just don't love us anymore.
1097164	1097624	That's it.
1097744	1099506	We need to start selling off Loki's stuff.
1100166	1100947	That's a good idea.
1101908	1102508	Put it on eBay.
1103429	1106971	No, I think actually maybe what part of it is is that, you know, we had a bunch of weeknight shows.
1107011	1107852	Now we only have one.
1107872	1110274	We can sell Loki as a virtual boyfriend on eBay.
1112396	1114017	Nelly might have issues with that, his fiance.
1114117	1114817	But it's virtual.
1115218	1115678	Like the chi.
1119420	1119740	I don't know.
1119760	1120461	This was on eBay.
1123084	1123604	So I don't know.
1123784	1126387	I think part of that might be because we don't have as much weeknight programming.
1126427	1131612	Of course, the lovely DarkSakura, being the trooper she is, still has her Tuesday night show, and I hope you all are listening because it's very nice.
1132313	1133214	It's a nice program.
1133554	1134835	I have a few people.
1135376	1138219	It's something the whole family can sit around the computer and really enjoy.
1138639	1141182	Sure, if they want to hear, Hi, Dad, I'm in jail.
1141983	1142984	I like it here.
1145086	1147667	Yeah, so, but no, we're going to remedy that.
1147707	1149288	We have a brand new show.
1150708	1154450	I don't know how much I want to say about it yet because it's not done, but we're going to have a lunchtime show.
1154710	1161874	So we're going to have programming in the daytime, which should be very interesting, but it's going to be something that plays for like a half hour every Monday through Friday.
1163014	1164215	And what it is, I can't tell you yet.
1165343	1167263	It's going to be very cool.
1167644	1172184	I love the idea, partially because I've worked so hard on it, but I think it really is a good idea.
1172445	1173065	So you'll have that.
1173165	1178826	And of course, also we had some posts on the forums this week on the OrangeLaunchRadio.com site on the forums.
1179046	1181806	Some folks wanted to know, what happened to Outside the Box?
1182106	1194869	Well, unfortunately due to real life and people having jobs, especially at employers that can't seem to give them regular schedules, etc., etc., we kind of had to put Outside the Box on the back burner for a while.
1195535	1197316	A ticket to help me move?
1225212	1226253	You can drive the truck.
1226273	1227534	You're going to be moving next Sunday.
1227554	1229295	We'll let you drive the U-Haul.
1229335	1230816	You do not want me driving the U-Haul.
1230856	1232277	That is some scary shit right there.
1232458	1233619	I cannot drive U-Hauls.
1234259	1235840	So, you don't want me doing that.
1237370	1241072	Actually, next Sunday, June the 26th, is my actual birthday birthday.
1241412	1248055	And because DarkSakura is moving and because I have my birthday, we are not going to have a live show that night, I don't think.
1248435	1248715	No.
1249136	1249956	No live show that night.
1249996	1251957	But we will have something else in our place.
1252617	1261161	And then, but in two weeks, when we come back July 3rd, huge show because it's our three-year anniversary, if you can believe it.
1261261	1262682	Three years of doing this crap.
1263783	1266364	Three years, three studios, three hosts.
1266943	1268285	Three migraines every week.
1270128	1271410	All kinds of aches and pains.
1271550	1273312	Yes, so we've got that to look forward to.
1273352	1274314	Torture, torture.
1276604	1276864	DarkSakura
1305888	1312356	My week has been just work and moving and lots and lots of pain.
1314958	1315439	Not the band.
1315879	1317121	No, but they're a good band.
1318835	1323218	But I've been having a flare-up from my car accident.
1324819	1347875	I'm having some pretty bad muscle spasms around my right hip, so I scheduled myself an appointment to see the doctor, who gave me more lovely Vicodin, a new muscle relaxer called Robaxin, I think is what it's called, something like that, and more ibuprofen, lots and lots of lovely refills of everything, and then also told me that the reason why I'm...
1348835	1353359	Having other pain is because my diet is hurting my digestion.
1354040	1356842	So I get to completely change how I'm eating, which is a lot of fun.
1357582	1359924	So yeah, salad.
1363487	1365569	Other than that, I've been doing nothing but moving.
1365669	1374897	I haven't played any games really, except for a couple of the games on the Guerrilla site before I found out that we're actually moving next weekend and not the weekend after.
1376257	1376437	WTF?
1376457	1376577	WTF?
1395117	1397839	I found one of my old RPG journals from when I played D&D.
1397859	1399380	It was great.
1399841	1401522	Found old character sheets, lots of old nerdy crap.
1424656	1426998	D20s I also did find my sketchbook from 1996
1443070	1444852	I want to take you back!
1462326	1465987	So, um, maybe those will find their way onto the internet.
1466287	1470128	Because actually, I look a lot better now than I did then.
1471008	1474108	Because my first year here, I put on like 10 pounds right away.
1475469	1476569	California will do that to you.
1477529	1478749	Either that or make you anorexic.
1479970	1481150	It's either one extreme or the other.
1481550	1482930	Yeah, but that's it for me.
1483770	1484871	Other than, I hate dust!
1487431	1488571	Alright, uh, moving on.
1488631	1489031	Loki!
1489792	1490792	Hey, how was your week?
1490812	1491212	How was your day?
1491412	1491592	Huh?
1492589	1494692	Oh, yeah, we do a show here, remember?
1496333	1496814	That's right.
1498176	1499437	Well, let's see what I do this week.
1500658	1511511	Well, finally, my purchase of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas has finished, so I was able to play my game, legally.
1512212	1512712	And, um...
1513593	1516736	So, it was quite interesting because I was trying out every single mod.
1516777	1518438	Did the credit card get held up?
1518498	1520541	What exactly slowed this down?
1520781	1529871	You have to understand, you see, that, you know, when you're shipping stuff, sometimes, you know, the truck breaks down or whatnot.
1529991	1530371	Right.
1530611	1532794	But over the internet, sometimes... Or when you're in a queue...
1534881	1545149	I know, I know, they just, for some reason, you know, the last bit of the game just, you know, wouldn't ship, or wasn't ready to ship right away for like about a week, you know, I guess with a manual or a sticker or something.
1545769	1550953	So I had to wait for a while for it to get done shipping, and then I was ready to go to play my brand new game.
1551134	1557278	And so anyways, the graphics are awesome, and I got to actually try out some of the mods in it, so...
1558439	1559820	What was the first thing you did?
1560220	1566943	I modded the Trash Master to be super fast and handle like crazy, so that was fun.
1566983	1579348	And then for some reason I did this code where it says become a slut magnet, and so I put it in, and for some reason I was in the gimp outfit with the dildo and my army of sluts following me, so that was interesting.
1579908	1582569	And then, um, what else?
1582589	1584330	Remind me to save that clip for the next intro.
1584890	1594938	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1609509	1612513	After playing around with the game some, um, what was it?
1612853	1623985	Actually, the only thing that pissed me off about the game is the controls in it, because you have to kind of use the mouse and keyboard, and I hate that, because I don't play first-person shooters, so I don't like the mouse-keyboard thing.
1624126	1628751	I like, you know, just one thing and be done with it, but...
1629702	1630082	and so on.
1646992	1648254	Make her pawn it.
1663132	1664312	And how many rings do you get?
1664512	1665233	I get one.
1687499	1688100	One stupid ring.
1688120	1688740	You know what?
1689521	1690501	She's paying for that ring.
1690521	1691102	Oh, that's nice.
1691262	1693023	But I have to pay for the other three, okay?
1694064	1694584	You know what?
1694904	1697106	I think this whole wedding ring business is retarded.
1697946	1703830	Because the only reason that... See, Dan and I are having one each, and we're having them custom-made to match.
1704611	1705752	Together, the price is $650.
1705912	1710295	Damn straight, that's what I'm saying, but... I want it made out of titanium.
1712137	1713577	Subtitles by the Amara.org community
1736270	1737711	It's the color of bondage.
1739192	1741354	It's a chick magnet is what it is.
1742515	1744116	Because you know women love married men.
1745738	1750942	You know how when you take magnets and you put the negative against the negative and they won't stick together for any reason?
1751142	1753444	In fact, they push each other away with great force.
1754044	1756486	That's what the wedding ring does in the chick magnet sense.
1759449	1761910	No, I think you've been misinformed.
1762011	1762351	But anyways...
1762931	1765212	Um, sorry, I don't understand your hetero culture.
1766853	1770394	Well, I don't understand women either, so, you know, we're pretty even.
1770494	1773135	You know what, I don't understand other women myself.
1773855	1776496	Because I think that this whole, I think the whole wedding business is retarded.
1777316	1780237	Damn straight, why the hell do we have to spend so much money on one fucking day?
1780257	1781438	I'm getting married in the backyard!
1781858	1787000	And the ceremony isn't going to be longer than five minutes, and then I'm going to have a party and get fucking drunk!
1789960	1797263	Orange Lounge Radio is here bridging the gap between straight men and gay men because we can at least agree on one thing.
1797764	1798904	Women are crazy.
1800105	1803267	Damn straight, and I can say this because I'm certifiably nuts.
1804187	1806949	Anyways, so yeah, we've already set a date.
1807009	1809270	It is on a Sunday, but it is next year.
1809950	1816774	And I won't be going to E3 next year, unfortunately, because that falls the week after the wedding.
1817813	1819634	which that won't be good.
1820575	1822656	Why do you think I rescheduled mine away from April?
1822676	1823917	I'm doing mine in three months.
1824037	1824457	FIRED!
1826298	1827139	I don't care.
1827219	1830321	I mean, ironically enough, they'd probably be paying my way.
1830341	1830981	Make her come with.
1831001	1831501	You know what?
1831521	1832522	Introduce her to celebrities.
1832542	1838786	In a relationship, there must always be compromise, not, you know, okay, whatever you say.
1839026	1844829	Yeah, but I don't think honeymoon, you know, over, uh, I don't think I'm gonna win that, you know.
1844849	1845510	Alright.
1845790	1847511	But anyways, anyways, so yeah, yeah.
1849679	1853462	This will be the night she's listening and your ass is dead when you get home.
1853482	1854423	She's not listening.
1854443	1856704	She doesn't even know how to listen to this show.
1860928	1862289	I started planning a wedding.
1862789	1863570	An actual wedding.
1864662	1873991	I went on one of those retarded websites that gives you a budget, and I saw all this paying for this crap and this crap and... A nude mariachi band?
1874631	1874771	No.
1875232	1884560	And this, and I was like, they started off the budget at like $7,000, and I'm like, fuck a bunch of that, that's, you know, like all my savings right now.
1885021	1886102	I'd be lucky if ours was $7,000.
1887654	1892075	So basically, we're probably going to get out of my wedding for under $1,000.
1893356	1893576	Under $1,000.
1893936	1899938	And then probably go spend another $1,000 when we have our two days at Disneyland honeymoon.
1901458	1902599	And then come back home and go to work.
1903699	1905379	We've been together for seven years already.
1905540	1907120	We don't need all this bullshit.
1907360	1910981	You know, I'm wondering, since gays can't technically get married, can we get some kind of discount?
1911401	1912082	That's what I'm wondering.
1912262	1916603	Since we get discount weddings, do we get discounts on the costs?
1918407	1918947	Just curious.
1919407	1920808	No, that's all for a gay wedding.
1920888	1924949	They had this on, oh God, I don't even remember which show it was.
1925189	1927249	Probably something on Bravo, probably.
1928049	1929650	It might have been Lysol.
1930450	1944753	Basically, their wedding ceremony was a fashion show, and what they did was they actually went and got their names legally changed so that it was both last names hyphened.
1945794	1946274	I've heard of that.
1946354	1946774	I've heard of that.
1947324	1958870	Well, one of my friends was telling me about some other friends of hers who actually had their last names combined into one new last name effective when they were married.
1958930	1959830	I've heard of that kind of stuff.
1960651	1962532	I'm going to have a fucked up last name.
1962632	1963832	I just want the tax breaks.
1963912	1966213	I'm going to have a fucked up Dutch last name.
1966714	1968875	I have no Dutch blood in me.
1969804	1978909	Wait a minute, without giving away the soon-to-be-mister's last name, does it start with the same three letters that my last name does?
1979429	1979609	No.
1979849	1980310	My real one?
1981090	1981250	No.
1981270	1981870	Oh, I thought it did.
1982451	1992656	Because that would have been funny if we were both... If you want some Dutch blood in your system, we can go find a Dutch virgin that you can convert over to a man.
1993597	1995818	Anyways, I'm half Dutch, don't do that.
1997703	2001927	I am nothing against anyone Dutch, mind you, because there's you and there's Dan.
2001947	2003929	Yeah, yeah, I'm sitting right here, so say it.
2004369	2011816	I've got the tons of Celtic and then, you know, Slavic mix, which means I can out-drink anybody.
2012036	2014098	And it also means you're very Enya-esque.
2014118	2022826	So anyways, yeah, we looked at the wedding location crap, and...
2023681	2024282	That's about it.
2024322	2029107	I thought about playing Final Fantasy, but I had other things I was working on, so I couldn't do that.
2030368	2031869	I've started yet another project.
2031889	2034192	Are you going to finish this one?
2034232	2034572	This one?
2034752	2035153	Well, maybe.
2035493	2043941	This one does not involve any actual purchasing of anything or any sort of actual monetary dedication.
2045353	2047533	But it's going to take a very, very, very, very long time to finish.
2048414	2048794	Sounds good.
2051254	2053355	Real quotes from the chat room.
2053615	2056776	www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on chat.
2057456	2062917	SSJ100Matt says, They say 65-75% of men masturbate on their honeymoon.
2067578	2068198	Dot, dot, dot.
2069058	2072019	Also 53% of statistics are made up on the spot, I guess.
2072099	2072439	I don't know.
2073857	2074117	All right.
2075058	2077219	Anyway, let's move on.
2078239	2079399	Loki, did you have any other thoughts?
2080720	2081741	God damn.
2082741	2083641	Ow, my foot.
2084142	2086343	Why did I shoot myself in my foot?
2086603	2088283	Nothing to do with the conversation.
2091645	2092685	No, my foot.
2092745	2093886	I need that for walking.
2095300	2095460	Seagird
2124048	2125208	Hi, how was your week, how was your day?
2126049	2128129	Why did we switch back to my old name from last year?
2128149	2130450	I don't know, I felt, I just, you have many names.
2130470	2130910	It's confusing to me.
2130930	2133211	And the next week, if you're here, oh no, we're not having a show next week.
2134031	2136572	If you're next, yeah, we'll just call you Siglatov, I like that.
2137652	2138032	I don't.
2138872	2141453	We can call you Mickey Gerd.
2142774	2143554	That's kind of funny.
2144174	2148535	I called you Miklatov last week, but I think more people know you as Sigurd.
2148755	2150256	I think I should have called you Sigurd last week.
2150956	2152137	Okay, it doesn't matter to me.
2152457	2153558	Nobody cares anymore, anyway.
2154399	2156680	You're too busy writing in pencil, too.
2156941	2158902	Dude, I'm playing minigames.
2159603	2160643	Oh, wait, we're talking about work.
2160683	2161684	I thought we were talking about now.
2162365	2163405	Oh, I got my hair cut.
2163966	2164586	That's about it.
2164806	2165647	And it's cute.
2165867	2167588	I like your new haircut quite a bit.
2167649	2170110	It's too bad the webcam sucks and we can't use it right now.
2170170	2172572	I can hold the microphone up to my hair and see if that helps.
2172632	2173293	Okay, let's see.
2176635	2177296	Do you hear that, y'all?
2177316	2178557	That sounds like hair.
2178577	2179657	That sounds like sexy hair.
2182505	2183525	I didn't do much else.
2183585	2183985	I worked.
2184506	2190887	And I came here and... Any songs getting you stuck in your head at work lately?
2192067	2200249	Only the ones I keep on my PSP from Echo Image that has nothing to do with DDR or my British band Manson I like.
2202550	2202850	I see.
2203350	2204250	Just prying.
2207291	2208011	You want anything to drink?
2210131	2210712	What?
2210732	2212034	I don't understand.
2212054	2215058	You have no idea how much Radiohead I've been listening to the last week.
2215578	2215859	Why?
2215939	2216900	Is that your angry band?
2216920	2218923	Radiohead is not an angry band.
2218943	2220185	They're my depressed band.
2220665	2221306	That makes sense.
2221506	2227795	Every other song that popped up on my iPod has been Radiohead or Super Furry Animals.
2229048	2235251	My depressed music, and I hate to admit this because it's going to make me sound so gay, but my depression music is Tori Amos.
2235411	2237792	Like, if I break it out to Tori, just get away.
2238272	2246116	I wanted to slit my wrist after listening to a combo of Radiohead, Bjork, Gloomy Sunday, and Tori Amos.
2246516	2250638	You know, I wanted to slit my wrist after hearing Bjork's latest album as well, but that's just because it fucking sucked.
2250718	2251378	I liked it.
2252038	2253639	I thought it was very stylish.
2254199	2254700	I didn't like it.
2255180	2255600	That's all right.
2256129	2259151	That's because you need to expand your horizons.
2259451	2259971	Broaden them.
2260111	2264393	Hey, my musical horizons are very broad.
2264553	2268215	I mean, look at my... Trans-ambient house.
2268475	2273058	Britney, Christina, Hilary Duff, Backstreet Boys.
2273278	2273758	No, I'm kidding.
2274198	2276939	I don't listen to that crap.
2276959	2278260	You have one Britney Spears song.
2278280	2282082	You have the expansive music taste of a teenage girl.
2282662	2285104	Yes, that's a very good description.
2285504	2285864	Thank you.
2287120	2288621	Speaking of music, it's quite funny.
2288641	2292184	You know that one song by Gwen Stefani, Holla Batgirl?
2292204	2293865	Never heard it, thank God.
2294365	2296887	This shit is bananas, B-A-N-A.
2296927	2297528	Yeah, okay.
2297768	2312438	So Nelly was singing the song, like, all week, but with the wrong lyrics, because she didn't know what the lyrics were, and I'm trying to remember what they were, but it's something about Kenny Rogers ate my cat, I ain't no Harlem Batgirl or something like that.
2313239	2315541	It was really weird, and she kept singing...
2317657	2335731	I... Plugging my ears, la la la la la la la I don't even know where she... Her lyrics are actually better than the song, so... I will never, ever, ever support anything Gwen Stefani does ever again.
2336812	2341716	Does this have to do with the fact that every photo she's in now she's with these, like, totally fake Japanese girls?
2341736	2343958	It has everything to do with that.
2344559	2345159	I'm just curious.
2346613	2349414	I do not... She thinks she's a Japanese girl, because she's not.
2350154	2355456	What she is doing is actually very damaging to women in general.
2356116	2357697	That's like saying Shane's black.
2361518	2366660	Gwen Stefani no longer receives any bit of support from me that I might ever have.
2368421	2369121	You know what's weird?
2369421	2370882	She is a waste of human flesh.
2371402	2373342	I was... And she can't sing for shit.
2373402	2374383	We were listening to the...
2375740	2376221	I have it!
2390757	2394138	Yeah, I thought that the first one, yeah.
2394518	2396159	I thought, back then, I thought it was fine.
2396179	2396519	Yeah, no, no.
2396779	2397659	Now I can't squirter.
2397679	2398079	No, no, no.
2398159	2398819	No, no, no.
2398979	2399780	I haven't gotten to my point yet.
2401080	2402120	But I was looking at the linear notes.
2402140	2405901	I was looking at the pictures and I was like, oh my god, they're so young in these pictures.
2406481	2408962	Like, they're like five years younger than I am now.
2410102	2411563	And that just made me feel old.
2412303	2417744	When Gwen Stefani looks like five years younger than me, that makes me feel really old.
2418845	2419465	I just wanted to share that.
2421133	2431176	I got a new high score right now on my Mario game.
2431856	2432336	Very nice.
2432696	2433417	What Mario game?
2434177	2436558	The one where you hit the shells with the paddle.
2436578	2437078	Good job.
2437458	2437838	Good job.
2441319	2441599	All right.
2442679	2445061	My week and my day was okay, I guess.
2445241	2446722	I just, you know, did the work thing.
2447263	2453607	And yesterday I went to Ikea with some friends, including Sigurd, because we picked him up at the Bart and then went over to Ikea.
2454468	2459892	And if they don't have Ikea in your neighborhood, then too bad for you, because Ikea is very cool, and they sell, like...
2460692	2463853	It's totally like my first apartment, the store.
2465814	2470996	It's great and they have, you know, stuff that you, it's Lego furniture because you take it home and build it yourself.
2471597	2477959	And I was being a real nasty bitch though because I hadn't eaten in like 12 hours and I was getting a massive headache.
2478019	2479200	It was really, really bad.
2479240	2479960	Like I don't know what it was.
2480552	2496575	and so the only cure was Swedish meatballs from Ikea so I had to wait in line for like 30 minutes to get Swedish meatballs and that was cool because Swedish meatballs rock and then my buddy John bought like a new bookshelf and it was so big that it wouldn't fit in the trunk of his car
2497028	2501371	So we had to lay it out in the backseat, except the only problem was that he was taking five people in his car.
2502051	2507315	So there were three of us in the backseat with a new bookshelf, and I think my feet are still in a little bit of pain.
2507335	2510436	I don't know about you, Sigurd, but my feet are in pain.
2512398	2518261	You don't know pain until you ride in the back of a VW Bug crammed with four people in the backseat.
2520803	2523625	You don't know pain until you're forced to sit through a Britney Spears marathon.
2525396	2527117	Which we might do tonight if we run out of show.
2527137	2532119	Actually, I do know that kind of pain because I sat through a marathon of, what was it?
2532819	2533159	Chaotic.
2533179	2533560	Chaotic.
2534560	2537121	I just found out that I'm going to go see George Carlin on the 9th.
2537782	2538702	Well, that's kind of cool.
2538922	2539362	Yeah.
2540163	2543024	And then go see the guy who does the Here's Your Sign.
2543663	2544024	George Carlin
2557765	2558726	I'm like, wait a minute, no, no, no.
2558766	2561249	Dude, I'd go see Parliament too if I could.
2561469	2568417	I know, but I could totally see you at a G, Parliament funk concert.
2568437	2569018	It would be hilarious.
2569038	2570780	George Carlin is freaking awesome.
2570800	2574744	Yeah, but then George Carlin is the seven words you can't say guy.
2575925	2578408	And then what's his name, Bill Engvall?
2578488	2578769	Engvall.
2579269	2581331	We're going to go see him in November.
2581431	2584674	Bill Ingvall is with Blue Collar TV, and I don't like that show.
2584694	2594942	There's one, no, actually, one of the guys that's on the Blue Collar comedy tour, the, like, really angry one, he's actually pretty good, because his comedy isn't all redneck comedy, it's just pretty, it's just normal comedy.
2595503	2601888	Whereas, like, you know, Jeff Foxworthy couldn't do normal stand-up comedy, you know, his life depended on.
2602188	2604590	But I can't remember if Bill Ingvall is a good one or not.
2604670	2606572	It's, um, the guy that's in the black, like,
2607352	2607812	TOUCH OF SATAN
2633306	2633726	I did.
2633846	2638269	I watched Touch of Satan at the Mystery Science Theater thing, and that was the Touch of Satan one.
2638549	2638929	I don't know.
2639069	2645552	I don't find Mystery Science Theater 3000 hilarious like a lot of my friends do, but I appreciate it.
2645652	2646553	I respect it.
2646953	2649554	I just don't laugh out loud a lot, but that Touch of Satan.
2650275	2657979	The bad thing is I was actually sitting there watching the Mystery Science Theater thing, and I'm kind of going, you know, I'm kind of curious what this movie is like without all the talking.
2662065	2662625	I don't know why.
2662746	2664087	I think I just like bad movies.
2664187	2664827	I don't know why.
2664907	2667369	Some of the Mystery Sanctuary 3000 movies are really funny.
2667769	2668350	Some are not.
2668730	2671152	This Island Earth can be yours if the price is right.
2672313	2673573	And my other favorite line in that one.
2674314	2675555	My own private airfield.
2677156	2678817	Which one is that from?
2678957	2679258	The movie.
2679318	2682320	And then there's the one with the gunslinger, which is one of my favorites.
2683040	2685042	With the female sheriff.
2686893	2688894	That one's really wrong.
2688914	2690154	What was it, The Touch of Satan?
2690174	2695156	It had some wonderful lines about, like, they kept making references to walnut farming or something like that.
2696057	2700158	And, like, he's all, oh no, my prized walnut died or something like that.
2700558	2710462	Manos, The Hands of Fate, where they showed the movie so awful that the doctor and the assistant both apologized for making them watch it.
2711866	2713067	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2736685	2739768	Bought waffles and came back and ate a whole box of waffles
2761887	2764008	I forgot to call my daddy, but my daddy lives in a trailer by Lake Eufaula now.
2782458	2784201	No, seriously, best Batman movie ever.
2784421	2784822	Go see it.
2785022	2785944	I highly recommend it.
2785984	2786985	You will not be disappointed.
2787125	2787326	All right.
2787606	2791953	We're going to do this real quick because the chat room suggested we dedicate this to the daddies of the world right now.
2792273	2795559	So we're going to play a song from DDR Solo, and it's called My Baby Mama.
2795759	2797642	And we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge.
2817574	2818274	Outro Music
2886423	2886743	All right.
2887183	2888804	Dedicated to the dads of the world there.
2889445	2891646	One dad having to defend himself there in that song, actually.
2892286	2895248	Hopefully, just remember, your dad could be like that.
2895608	2899210	That song's about a guy cheating on his woman, saying he's off with his baby mama.
2899550	2900371	Don't want no scrub.
2900711	2900991	All right.
2902211	2906914	Anyway, we have somebody who hasn't been on the show a whole lot, but we have my roommate here.
2907054	2907314	Hi.
2907434	2907754	Hello.
2907955	2908375	How are you?
2908775	2909355	I'm doing well.
2909395	2909716	How are you?
2909736	2911336	Do you have a stage name you want to use?
2912137	2912217	Um...
2913701	2920426	I don't want to be one of those middle-aged 300-pound women in a muumuu with five shillings.
2936914	2939738	Mama, I want me a new Barbie.
2940499	2942602	Mama, get me some chicken.
2944184	2949291	And so it had me thinking, well, we should be asking Extifer about the funny people that show up at Walmart.
2949311	2954118	So do you have any interesting, like, 400-pound women that buy, like, thong panty stories or anything?
2955600	2964335	I don't have any 400-pound women buying thong stories, but I had a bunch of guys buy them.
2964375	2967781	Walmart used to have this promotion or something like that.
2968443	2970004	Thong Underwear Guy Thong Underwear
2987174	2990097	and bought a bunch of them, and I just thought it was kind of weird.
2990377	2991378	Is that all they bought?
2991759	2993600	Yeah, it was, actually.
2993640	2994841	You know what else would have been funny?
2994881	2999686	If they'd bought all those thongs and a jar of mayonnaise or something, just to kind of throw you.
2999866	3003530	I don't remember any mayonnaise, but the thongs were still funny.
3004511	3007854	Wait, so they were buying, like, there were how many of them?
3009755	3013118	I don't remember off the top of my head, but maybe like three or four.
3013138	3013798	Okay.
3014479	3015320	And then they were buying like ten?
3015340	3016300	They bought them together.
3016380	3025047	That's like the funny thing about it is, I mean, I don't know, like if you're going to buy some thong underwear, I guess invite your friends.
3027355	3030616	Maybe it was less embarrassing to buy together, I don't know.
3030996	3032896	Now, what is the policy on that?
3032936	3036077	See, obviously you can't point and laugh at them and go, ha ha, you're buying underwear.
3036577	3045479	Oh, I have a good poker face, so I'm just like, you know, I just run them through and then have my laughs afterwards in the break room.
3045539	3051740	No, like as you're grabbing the underwear and putting it on the scanner, are you thinking, this is going to be touching some fat guy's balls pretty soon?
3051940	3053221	Actually, I do think that...
3054963	3056885	But I'm just glad that it hasn't yet.
3061388	3064751	Any other wonderful, glorious Walmart stories you want to share?
3064951	3067393	If I do come up with any, I'll let you know.
3067553	3068314	Alright, sounds good.
3068734	3069135	Thank you.
3069215	3072137	We should make this a regular segment where you come tell us a funny Walmart story.
3072478	3074499	So you get to work on next week's edition.
3074519	3075260	Or we're not here next week.
3075580	3076921	You have two weeks to come up with another one.
3076961	3077542	That's a lot of time.
3077662	3078583	Alright, you do that.
3078783	3079263	Thank you.
3083686	3086087	Poor bastard has his house taken over every Sunday by us.
3088249	3089169	How would you like that?
3090430	3093012	Well, I have an offer open.
3094652	3095593	Oh, that's true, huh?
3095653	3096033	Yeah.
3096293	3098695	Yeah, if you don't mind going out to the boonies of Citrus Heights.
3099035	3100716	I used to live in the boonies of Citrus Heights.
3100776	3104718	Well, not really the boonies, but... Not really the boonies, but it's a nice neighborhood.
3105119	3105419	Okay.
3105639	3106840	Yeah, it's a nice neighborhood.
3106860	3108361	I think I know which area you're... I'm gonna have a yard!
3108381	3110862	Dude, you're gonna have to water a yard?
3110962	3112343	Or, Dudette, you're gonna have to water a yard?
3112363	3112423	I'm...
3113134	3114595	Shit, no, Dan's job.
3116435	3117796	My parents are going on vacation.
3117836	3119097	They want me to come over and water.
3120537	3121638	What's this manual labor stuff?
3123538	3123899	All right.
3125679	3129961	Let's talk about some actual DDR, Bomani-ish news, things going on.
3130061	3141766	Loki, this is interesting because no other website is running this story except for us, so I'm assuming this is something you actually found out through your own means, but you're talking about release dates, right?
3141914	3142154	and so on.
3157882	3160344	September 28th, I want to say, for DDR Extreme?
3160384	3172235	According to our website, our own website, ornstownstream.com, DDR Extreme 2 is going to be out September 28th, 2005, and DDR Ultramix 3, November 2nd, 2005.
3172575	3174717	That's correct.
3174817	3175398	Election Day.
3177119	3177339	Right?
3177680	3178260	First Tuesday?
3178881	3179441	I don't know.
3179601	3180742	I don't vote.
3181123	3182204	Thank you for ruining America.
3184412	3187253	So define what initial street date means.
3187293	3189594	Does this mean it's already solid or what?
3189614	3192756	Let me give you an idea of how solid game street dates are.
3193316	3195357	There's this game called Psychonauts.
3195417	3196517	That's right, Psychonauts.
3196557	3199358	Came out on the Xbox not too long ago.
3199378	3200699	It was supposed to be coming out for the PlayStation 2.
3201379	3202179	This was back in May.
3202680	3203380	Got pushed to June.
3203740	3204761	Then got pushed to July.
3204861	3205801	Then went back to June.
3207062	3208342	Back to July, then back to June.
3208502	3210083	And it finally came out in June.
3210885	3213026	But, um, so, it depends.
3213126	3216368	Certain, um, companies, they'll move the dates around a little bit.
3217008	3223051	Um, it being about, you know, a ways away, date-wise, you know, three months away, it's possible it could move.
3223571	3224212	I don't think it will.
3224532	3226453	I mean, just because Konami's pretty good on their dates.
3226873	3235838	Other companies like EA and, oh, I don't know, um, Rockstar and anybody that's owned by Jack of all games, their dates are all fucked up.
3236298	3236598	Okay.
3236738	3237418	All over the place.
3237919	3238299	But, um,
3239548	3246185	Yeah, so basically I think that's probably pretty solid, just because the other two games before came out around the same time, so it makes sense, you know.
3248430	3257354	I'll let you know as we're getting closer when they're coming out because I'm the one that actually keeps track of our date changes in our system.
3257774	3258214	That's cool.
3258374	3258955	Good.
3258975	3260815	So you're taking it to OrangeLaundry.com.
3260916	3261196	Love it.
3261276	3261516	Love it.
3262176	3264237	Oh, and Carioca Revolution Party Edition.
3264257	3265258	I know that's coming out too.
3265598	3268379	Oh, and also the bundle I think is going to be $69, I think.
3268439	3269239	What bundle?
3270960	3275121	For, um, it's Ultramix 3, I think, is their bundle.
3275341	3276001	It's $69.
3276461	3276882	Retail.
3276962	3278362	I hear the Xbox pad's really good.
3278402	3279842	I've never played with one.
3279882	3284724	But I still use my Red Octane Ignition because it hasn't broke yet, so it serves me well.
3284744	3287164	I know Taiko No Tachiton 2's coming out at some point.
3287484	3287784	Really?
3287924	3288885	Or you mean Taiko Drum Master?
3289085	3289425	Whatever.
3289525	3289865	I don't know.
3290845	3293106	You gotta post more about the other games too, not just the two.
3293146	3299049	I try, I'm like, trying to keep track of, literally, there's a date change every day of the goddamn week.
3299849	3309873	Seriously, there's all these games that don't exist that our Dallas people are saying that do exist, and I tell them that they're not, and then they're wrong, and yeah.
3310673	3328317	Anyway, these dates should really come as no surprise, because it's always been kind of assumed that both games are coming out in the fall, and honestly, we kind of have a pattern going here now from the past two years, and we usually get extreme September-ish, and we get...
3329478	3334921	The Ultra Mixed Games November-ish, so this really isn't a surprise at all that these dates are the way they are.
3335202	3337863	Although one is really close to the end of the month and one is really close to the beginning.
3338264	3344288	I don't remember the games coming out so close together because they're only about four weeks apart at this point.
3344908	3347790	And I think previously we've had like seven or eight weeks between the games.
3348030	3352994	Well, it's really like, you know, as far as the release schedule or whatever.
3353414	3354274	Sigurd, you're back.
3354574	3356675	Now, I don't know what you can tell me and can't tell me about NDAs.
3356695	3359896	We're talking about the release dates for Extreme 2 and Ultramix 3.
3361237	3362717	Are they close?
3364058	3364478	Or what?
3364678	3365198	What do you know?
3366379	3371921	I honestly know nothing about the release dates, except what online retail sites are saying.
3372081	3378363	And usually, you can trust those if it's not Red Octane putting out the game.
3380437	3382518	Sorry, but let's face it, you pushed back three times.
3382819	3392905	If it's not in the groove, it usually has a pretty good release date, and if they report on it, they usually get that from the company, but I haven't seen any official things in the office.
3394086	3397388	It's kind of weird that he would find out before you, but I guess that's the way it goes.
3397408	3399510	Well, he doesn't deal with the sales end of it.
3399710	3404133	We've also gotten GameStop has most of them, too.
3405814	3407275	I just asked Dan if everyone knew anything.
3407833	3409194	They're all on the same mailing list.
3409214	3417822	What I want to know is, when are those V-Rares, assuming that both are going to have a V-Rare again, I don't see why they wouldn't, because I think people like those, and Konami likes it when people like things.
3418282	3426530	Assuming we're getting new V-Rares, I'm not going to bother asking Seeger, because he'll just tell me NDA, but assuming we're getting new V-Rares, the question is, when will those come out?
3426570	3429953	Could we get them maybe before, with a pre-order, or are we just going to get them the day of the game?
3430033	3434677	Well, you know, maybe we can get some hookups with those people from Konami of Japan checking out our show.
3436403	3446156	Oh yes, we were perusing our website statistic logs for another project and we were looking at some of the domains that have been visiting us and we were kind of happy with some of the ones we saw.
3446256	3449361	So, hi to our friends at Konami of Japan who listen secretly to our show.
3450182	3451003	What time is it there?
3452144	3452405	Like...
3452935	3453875	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3482031	3484555	So there's your release dates for the new games.
3484575	3493169	I think what we'll do, we'll actually go to a longer break right now and when we come back from this break, we got a brand new Ultramix 3 song to play for you guys and we want to talk about this story.
3493830	3496054	Pump it up and in the groove.
3497970	3498930	are joining forces.
3499470	3505932	And yes, we already knew this in some capacity, but I was quite surprised with the news I heard this week.
3505952	3508272	So I'm really curious to see what you guys have to say about it.
3508312	3511273	Skypline will be open as well at some point when we come back.
3512293	3515153	So let's go to a break, and we'll come back.
3515253	3519934	So in this break, I think we'll hear some... Since we did in the last break, we did some DDR songs we haven't heard in a while.
3520294	3523835	And this break, we'll do some 2DX songs we haven't heard in a while.
3524375	3529946	So we're going to start it off with, let's see, I don't know, what am I in the mood to hear?
3530006	3532231	Let's hear Sanctus.
3533473	3535817	We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

3829222	3829465	Wow.
3879415	3880016	Thanks for watching!
3944719	3948063	Hello everybody, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
3948103	3949544	Hope you're having a
3960177	3960737	Nice night.
3961138	3962739	Very happy, fun, go-lucky night.
3963500	3965161	There's violence in my living room right now.
3965721	3970745	My roommate's watching Final Destination 2, and I just watched some girl get her head chopped off.
3971605	3972406	It wasn't very nice.
3973487	3978991	Might I add that Final Destination 2 is exactly the same movie as Final Destination 1, just gorier.
3979411	3980432	That is about it.
3981593	3983055	It is exactly the same.
3983415	3984977	How did her head get chopped off?
3985437	3986759	She was stuck in an elevator door.
3988941	3990463	Her head was stuck in an elevator door.
3990523	3990823	I don't know.
3992165	3994946	The Final Destination movies were all these crazy death trap scenarios.
3995007	3996287	It was like Mousetrap, you know?
3996587	4000409	First the ball rolls down the stairs, then it rolls down a little tube, and it sets off the guy who jumps in the bin.
4000749	4001610	You know, all that crap.
4002190	4002790	I love that game.
4003691	4005212	That's like the Final Destination movies.
4005232	4007593	It's like Mousetrap the movie, except people die in hideous ways.
4007833	4014937	That'd be hilarious if there was a movie where the villain, his calling card was the Mousetrap game, and then the whole thing would set off a bomb at the end.
4015197	4018438	The only problem with Mousetrap, though, is that sometimes it didn't go off just right.
4018638	4020099	You know, it gets stuck or something.
4020639	4021660	So I guess that wouldn't work.
4023922	4024842	Well, anyway, I don't know.
4024862	4029204	This guy with the hook got the chick's hair and then she ended up getting stuck in the door because of it.
4029284	4029645	I don't know.
4030885	4031826	And then it was like, ew, blood.
4031866	4035847	And then Extraper said something about all the... I haven't seen Found Destination 2.
4036068	4037008	I've only seen the first one.
4037548	4039469	But he said something about Kool-Aid.
4039689	4040810	All the blood looks like Kool-Aid.
4040870	4045052	Yeah, there's a lot of CG blood in this one.
4045292	4051575	One person gets killed by a giant window falling on them and flattens them.
4052375	4052916	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4071249	4076133	My best friend at the time and I were laughing and laughing and laughing.
4076533	4080876	And people were turning around in the theater looking at us going, you insensitive bastards.
4080896	4082817	That girl just got splattered all over the street.
4082857	4084138	And we're laughing and laughing.
4084338	4085459	Because it's the way that it happens.
4085479	4085939	She's all screwed.
4085959	4088061	She's like, I just wish you guys would drop dead.
4088121	4091003	And then here comes the bus.
4093525	4096067	Jurassic Park 3 when they were pulling the people out of the field.
4097182	4098184	Buffet, buffet.
4099107	4105542	I haven't seen Jurassic Park 3 because it just, you know, it was Jurassic Park 3 and I figured 1 and 2 was... It was with the raptors.
4107577	4108877	Really?
4109738	4114398	These people were crossing the fields and the velociraptors were running through this tall field.
4114818	4116699	And you'd see little people disappear.
4116919	4120920	And we were like, it's a buffet for the raptors.
4121060	4129441	For a second there, before she mentioned raptors, I thought it might have been like, you know, maybe Rosie O'Donnell or something in the field.
4129461	4134482	She might have been like, you know, snatching people because you never know.
4135834	4136074	Thanks.
4136594	4136894	Alright.
4137835	4141416	Back to the gaming realm, which we talk about here on this show.
4142457	4144437	Brand new Ultramix 3 news this week.
4144537	4148139	Last week, we got to unveil this, because nobody else found this.
4148159	4155442	We were the first to find this, that Spray had actually announced on their website that they were going to have a new song in Ultramix 3 called I Am Gothic.
4155482	4158703	And we played this song for you guys last night, which it sounds like... Last week.
4159540	4160341	I'm sorry, last week.
4160661	4165426	To which it sounds like most of you guys had a bit of an eh kind of reception.
4165786	4167348	I don't know, I think that's the best way I can say it.
4167388	4168769	It was kind of an eh reception.
4169370	4170371	I like the song.
4170831	4172032	I know Sigurd likes the song.
4172152	4173213	The rest of you guys are kind of eh.
4173233	4174735	Here's a little reminder of I Am Gothic.
4186570	4195035	So, um, now this has already previously been announced on DDRFreaks in the official Ultramix 3 thread.
4195075	4198077	We don't get to be the first to tell you about this, because we didn't find this, somebody else did.
4198577	4200878	Um, a user here by the name of Rockus...
4202339	4206581	who I think is also one of our listeners, so you go, boy, found this one.
4206821	4214644	And it's actually a link to a magazine website, Virus Magazine, which I think has to do with industrial music.
4215444	4223168	And sure enough, another band has themselves said that they have a song in Ultramix 3, and it's a band called The Azoic.
4223648	4228850	The Azoic used to be on Different Drum, and I don't think they're on there anymore, but they used to be on Different Drum.
4229530	4238275	And I think it's kind of neat that the Azoic is moving over into DDR because I actually bought the Azoic's last album, of which a remix of this song is on.
4238335	4239356	So I think that's kind of neat.
4240816	4245379	Based off of samples I heard on a different drum when Ultramix 2 got popular, so I'm kind of excited about that.
4245759	4249101	Anyway, the song is called Conflict, and it's the Turmoil mix.
4249981	4253982	and then the rest of the article talks about how theazoic.com has been down lately.
4254402	4255843	But at least we get to find out a new song.
4255883	4259823	So hey, I'm liking this trend since Sigurd won't tell us anything about the song list.
4260504	4262244	Just kidding, I know you're under contract or whatever.
4263224	4266345	The artists themselves are starting to spill the beans about the song.
4266425	4272006	So now we have another confirmed song thanks to a band with a big mouth, The Azoic and Conflict.
4272187	4273227	So we're going to hear the song.
4273287	4273827	You guys ready?
4274778	4275219	I guess.
4275239	4278183	Because we got it here on Orange Lounge Radio because that's what we do.
4278443	4280325	We find songs and we play them for you.
4280546	4280786	Yep.
4281006	4283930	So here's a brand new song from DDR Ultramix 3.
4284872	4286273	The band is called The Ezoic.
4286694	4288797	And this is Conflict, the turmoil mix.
4289378	4290960	Here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4292237	4295100	Conflict Confusion Distrust
4323896	4324977	Thanks for watching!
4373109	4373771	Thanks for watching!
4480516	4481597	Thank you for watching!
4509052	4509934	Thanks for watching!
4601067	4604408	Orange Lounge Radio premiere there of Conflict, the turmoil mix.
4605188	4609850	Coming up from DDR, Ultramix 3 is going to be the game that has that song in it.
4610270	4614192	And that was announced by the band, or at least a magazine on behalf of the band.
4614232	4615192	I don't know how that works there.
4615972	4618413	But the beans were spilled, and there it is.
4618533	4619733	That song's going to be in Ultramix 3.
4620374	4620934	What do you guys think?
4620994	4627836	Now keep in mind, the song there clocks in at five and a half minutes, but they edit these songs down to a minute and a half, two minute range.
4628176	4629517	You'll get like a verse and a chorus.
4629577	4629957	What do you think?
4630322	4631691	Sounds like the stuff they play at Rapture.
4633078	4639141	Yeah, I think it's kind of ironic that we got last week the I Am Gothic song, which was a little tongue-in-cheek.
4639521	4642442	It wasn't really a goth song, but it wasn't really anti-goth.
4642462	4643263	It was just a tongue-in-cheek.
4643343	4646404	It was a weird owl of goth, I think, to me.
4646444	4648325	It's kind of synth-pop, I don't know.
4649026	4649726	In a way, in a way.
4651207	4653668	We get that song last week, and now we get this this week.
4653688	4654728	Did they actually play it?
4656609	4660911	We get an actual industrial goth kind of sounding song that you would hear at a club.
4660931	4661231	It was cool.
4661251	4661591	I like it.
4662432	4662612	Loki.
4663032	4667853	Are they like suffering or lacking in the goth demographic for DDR or something?
4667873	4669214	Because this is what it seems like.
4669274	4675035	It's like, how can we get those goths to play a pop dance game?
4675835	4678216	Let's put some sad music in there.
4679276	4679656	I don't know.
4679736	4682117	It's just, it's okay, I guess.
4682237	4690499	But let's just, hopefully the next few artists that announce that their songs are going to be in there will be a little something different than, say, I don't know, goth music.
4691530	4697173	Well, now, you know, I'm sure they're going to have a variety of music, as they always do, and Konami's not the one releasing this information, either.
4697213	4701715	It's coming from the artists themselves, so maybe the gothic bands are just excited about DDR.
4701755	4702055	I don't know.
4703116	4707238	I don't know what to say about that, so... Well, whatever.
4707278	4709139	I mean, it's just... It's okay.
4710120	4712121	I didn't really care for that song too much, actually.
4712441	4713961	Sigurd, what do you think of The Azohic?
4714962	4720685	I really, really, really like that song, and it got stuck in my head for about a week when I...
4721161	4722685	I'm glad it's in the game
4729144	4731546	Me personally, I'm thrilled that that song made the game.
4732606	4742954	I think it's kind of weird because it's interesting because I'm looking at the chatroom reaction and a lot of folks are saying, you know, I'm liking this, me likey, it's a very upbeat kind of song.
4743674	4746977	I like this, Arcadian42 says, I hate myself and I want to DDR.
4748778	4749018	Get it?
4749038	4750799	Instead of I hate myself and I want to DDR, forget it.
4750819	4752761	We got it.
4753101	4753721	Yeah, yeah, fine.
4755102	4757203	It's kind of a sad song to me.
4757243	4759245	It's a very, like, kind of downbeat.
4759325	4762987	Although it is upbeat, dancey, it's definitely a song that will work for DDR.
4763367	4765468	It's kind of depressing in a way to me.
4766489	4774473	And then I think about Ultramix 3's theme and all the happy bubble water theme and the, you know, yeah, it's DDR with all these happy characters.
4775474	4777375	I love goth music and DDR.
4777415	4778616	I'm going to go dry myself now.
4780717	4781157	I don't know.
4781237	4783138	It's kind of just interesting.
4784379	4786820	I'm sure not every song is going to be a goth song.
4786860	4789001	I think it's just a coincidence.
4789021	4790121	We need DDR Dark Mix.
4791542	4793542	I would so like buy that.
4794243	4797924	I'm so gothic that I play DDR in dark mode.
4798444	4801366	Dude, DDR Ultra Mix's goth served us.
4804007	4804347	Alright.
4805547	4807548	So we'll see what artist spills the beans next.
4807888	4808469	My advice...
4809961	4811023	This is what we've had now.
4811263	4817534	One, two folks that are somehow related to a different drum, even though maybe directly or not.
4818004	4819665	Keep an eye on the websites for these guys.
4819685	4824770	Don't forget that MidiHead is also related to a different drum.
4824850	4827792	And MidiHead is on a different drum, and we already know that Raise Your Hands is going to be in there.
4827812	4828873	We played that a few weeks ago.
4829473	4834037	Also kind of not so much a goth song, but an industrial-ish song.
4834597	4835898	So kind of interesting.
4837320	4842544	My advice, keep an eye on those websites, those different drum artists, because one of them is bound to spill the beans next.
4842584	4843805	I don't think three is...
4845505	4850989	It seems like last time we had more than three different drum licenses, so I'm thinking there's got to be at least a couple more.
4851169	4851629	So we'll see.
4852970	4853230	Alright.
4854531	4854992	I like this.
4855032	4856713	Now the chat room is going off on this.
4857013	4858734	Every time you conform, you lose a bar.
4861896	4862376	Interesting.
4863157	4863477	Alright.
4864838	4865338	Moving on.
4867620	4870282	Let's talk about some other big news that's going on in the scene right now.
4871862	4876904	Actually, what happened this week is that Andamiro, or no, I'm sorry, Roxor put out this press release.
4876984	4879105	Maybe it was a joint release with Andamiro, I don't know.
4879865	4882526	But it's actually a post that's on Roxor's forums.
4883306	4890309	Roxor Games is proud to announce their partnership with Andamiro Company Limited to create the next generation of arcade dance games.
4890369	4896191	The first collaboration, quote, Pump It Up, colon, In The Groove 2.
4898325	4924448	combines, end quote, combines Rockstar's unparalleled gameplay, music, and graphical content with Animero's co-development support and superior cabinet construction featuring blah, blah, blah, flat screen, blah, blah, blah, stereo system, blah, blah, blah, 130 songs, blah, blah, blah, all the songs from the original in the groove, blah, blah, blah, cooperation from Rockstar and Animero, blah, blah, blah, 1,100 dance routines because of all these songs, blah, blah, blah,
4929846	4933869	Pump It Up in the Groove 2 is now available from game distributors nationwide.
4933909	4935351	So that was a little bit of a surprise.
4936271	4939775	No surprise there that Andamiro and Rockstar are going to be working together.
4939815	4946381	We already knew Andamiro was helping in the cabinets in some capacity, but now In the Groove is part of the Pump It Up series.
4947870	4948270	Weird?
4949471	4950071	Not really.
4950391	4950891	Not really?
4951172	4951632	What do you think?
4965228	4974532	I've seen some posts about what is a freeze roll, and I don't remember where I read this, but I do know I read it into what is the freeze roll.
4974972	4985536	A freeze roll, which is this new thing they're putting in the groove 2, I'm sorry, pump it up in the groove 2, is instead of holding like a freeze arrow, you hold your foot down.
4985856	4988497	The Freeze Roll is you have to tap your foot repeatedly.
4988838	4992520	Like, think about Paranoia Survivor Heavy, I think it was.
4992980	4993760	Was it Paranoia Survivor?
4994621	4996302	No, no, no.
4996362	4997042	No, no, no.
4997062	4998263	Can't Stop Falling in Love is one.
4998283	4999203	What was the one in Fifth Mix?
4999904	5000044	The...
5000916	5002077	Paranoia Eternal
5030109	5031350	during that freeze time.
5031490	5034691	It's kind of like Taiko no Tachijin or something like that.
5034751	5040313	Yeah, Taiko no Tachijin, the more you hit, or Donkey Konga, the more you hit during one of those rolls, the more points you get.
5040373	5041474	I think that's kind of what it is.
5041494	5043515	Well, that's not as bad then if it's an incentive.
5043575	5046456	I think that's what it is, but still retarded, whatever.
5046516	5051498	I mean, it's... I'm not going to go, oh, that game has freeze rolls, I've got to go play it right now.
5051558	5053099	Instead, I'm going to go, no.
5053564	5060347	It's okay, I mean, okay, they want a new idea, here you go, it's a new idea, whatever.
5060387	5073452	I'm glad though they have the nice widescreen monitor to show off those really bland graphics in a really large size, because, you know, a game like that just really needs the extra monitor space and resolution, because, you know, before...
5073792	5076634	It couldn't quite show off the bland graphics that were in it.
5076654	5088563	Well, now, now, in the press release under In the Groove 2, I'm sorry, pump it up, In the Groove 2, under the new features, all new graphics featuring new In the Groove characters.
5088703	5090124	Oh, wow, they're going to be bland too?
5090444	5097269	You know, all new graphics meaning, we made it red, that's what it is, we made it red, all new graphics.
5099020	5100521	Featuring in the groove characters.
5100621	5102903	Where have I seen dancing characters before?
5103023	5107847	Where did I... Maybe it was in... Where did I see that?
5108307	5109608	I know it was in Maniac Mansion.
5109728	5111049	That's right, it was in Maniac Mansion.
5111490	5113251	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
5113271	5114572	It was the Jungle Beat game.
5116273	5117814	Jungle Book, Jungle Beat Games.
5134995	5136836	Speaking of which, I got a funny story about that later.
5137156	5138256	Okay.
5139237	5139537	Let's see.
5139657	5141677	Unlockable songs and expert steps.
5142098	5145039	Greatly expanded compatibility for USB memory cards.
5145059	5153222	I think I was reading somewhere where the USB will now not only download your scores, but the whole damn arcade high scores will go on your USB card.
5153682	5153982	Which is...
5154742	5155683	Interesting, I guess.
5155723	5167829	So I think they're trying to formulate this way of doing like a national ranking, which, you know what, one thing I really like about In The Groove, and I give them a lot of credit for, the USB support is phenomenal, and I wish DDR had something like it.
5167869	5171951	So I'll give them that, and I'm interested to see how they expand on the USB support.
5171971	5173051	So that's exciting news to me.
5174572	5180895	Novice difficulty with helpers like Traffic Light and Constant Scroll to assist players who are just getting started.
5182307	5184009	I have no idea what that means, but okay.
5184049	5185690	Traffic Light, that sounds interesting.
5188493	5191855	Let's see, 65 new songs.
5193357	5208210	This is one other thing I like about In The Groove versus DDR, because how many times has your DDR machine been reset at the local arcade, and you cannot get the stupid arcade operator to put in the code to unlock Stoic and all that stuff,
5209033	5213335	because, you know, they do an outside vending company or something so nobody will open the machine.
5213515	5214976	Even if you know the code, you can't put it in.
5215276	5225081	Well, one thing I like about what In The Groove does and Pump It Up In The Groove 2 is going to continue is that the unlock codes are actually entered by the players via the dance pad.
5225101	5226422	So I think that's good.
5226922	5227462	Smart idea.
5228103	5233726	So that's coming back and all that stuff that you've come to know and love or whatever about In The Groove.
5234846	5236287	Loki, any more hateful thoughts?
5237561	5244678	I got something that's not exactly... It's in the groove news, but it's not related to this particular in the groove news.
5245074	5246115	Okay, well, try me.
5246955	5256481	Okay, well, it was basically Indigrew was saying, Oh, our, you know, our encryption is kick-ass and no one will be able to defeat it, yadda yadda yadda.
5256901	5259403	Well, actually, no, it was not.
5260404	5274052	Because as soon as the game came out for the PlayStation 2, the entire theme, all the movies, and all the music, and all the steps, and everything else were ripped down.
5274432	5282779	I don't know if it's so much that as the fact as when people say, we have a great encryption scheme that nobody will be able to hack.
5299833	5302015	That is inviting people to come in and hack it.
5304657	5321271	I can think of examples that have nothing to do with video games, such as the CD companies, like Sony and stuff, when they said, oh, we're going to put out these copy-protected CDs, and you will not be able to copy these CDs no matter what you do, because it launches a program when you put the CD in, and you can't copy the CDs.
5321926	5324408	Well, here's the magic workaround that somebody found.
5324468	5324828	Get this.
5325328	5328891	Hold the shift key when you put in the CD to abort the auto-run feature.
5329431	5330672	Copy protection aborted.
5331713	5338058	So, when somebody says we cannot be hacked, that is just an invite to somebody to hack them.
5338818	5341200	I have to laugh, because basically here's what it is.
5341658	5341898	and so on.
5360424	5361224	Yes, we've done it.
5361624	5365006	We've done what those rocks or bastards claim to be impossible.
5365226	5374049	Again, we have cracked the encryption, in quotes, that houses the game's files using tools made in-house by our cracking experts.
5374509	5380552	Since In The Groove is just a rip-off of StepMania, the files were easily portable to the StepMania layout.
5380692	5386834	This SMZIP file contains songs, supporting graphics for use in StepMania.
5387793	5390757	Well, now I'm sure a lot of In The Groove fans are going rabble, rabble, rabble at that.
5390817	5395222	But, you know, that's just some kids showing off their internet penis because they cracked it.
5395263	5395903	Hooray for you.
5395983	5396424	Good job.
5396464	5396784	Whatever.
5397966	5399027	Don't take it too personally.
5400469	5401170	That type of stuff.
5402131	5403093	It's quite funny, but...
5404147	5409592	But basically, you can actually see some rips here on ITGFreak.com.
5409812	5410513	How appropriate.
5411233	5413375	Yeah, how appropriate that they'd be on there.
5414296	5415337	And they're pretty much perfect.
5416057	5418219	Granted, there's some little tweaks.
5418339	5421602	Are the loading times improved when you played in Step Mania?
5422103	5422403	I guess.
5423007	5429951	And what was up with the whole, I don't know, in the groove, like corrupting your save file or something like that?
5430551	5432852	I'm surprised that this game was so polished.
5433012	5450562	I mean, I would expect something from such a game that, you know... Now, now, now, somebody could just come up just as easily and say, you're just picking on him now, because somebody could easily come up and say, whoa, in DDR Extreme they have a whole song that was supposed to be unlocked that you can't get, da-da-da, you know, the memories debacle.
5451038	5451358	Whatever.
5451499	5455823	No, that was basically, you know, cut out the game, but some of the stuff is still in the code.
5455883	5459788	That's not... My save file gets erased because that song is not in the game.
5460929	5462510	Okay, okay, I'll give you that.
5462530	5463712	There's a slight difference there.
5463772	5464092	There is.
5464312	5465614	I'm sorry, I mean...
5466601	5467922	But you're picking on him.
5468322	5468942	You're picking on him.
5468962	5472143	The groove looks like something that someone would make homebrew for the Dreamcast.
5472223	5473464	I mean, this is what it looks like.
5473504	5475505	This game is just crap.
5475665	5476085	I'm sorry.
5476285	5477006	It is crap.
5477046	5478586	Look, we got enough hate mail last week.
5479046	5483588	Sigurd, what do you think of Pump It Up in the Groove 2?
5484109	5485429	And I'll say it for you.
5485669	5488751	What Sigurd says does not reflect in any way, shape, or form Konami.
5488791	5489351	Da-da-da-da-da.
5489611	5497756	I'm very angry about it, because as everybody should know by now, um, or maybe they don't, I'm a huge fan of Pump It Up.
5498196	5504600	Like, half of me is dedicated to Konami, but the other half is all for Pump It Up and everything to do with Pump It Up.
5505481	5516948	And so when I heard this, I wanted to cry, because the half of me that loves Pump It Up could stay out of the Konami vs. Rocksword debate, and it could just go play Pump It Up, but now it has to, uh,
5517355	5525500	Get Involved, because apparently Endemira wanted to get sued again by Konami, or vice versa, or however that crappy lawsuit went.
5526241	5528242	But, yeah, I don't like it.
5528882	5536027	And I've even tried Pump recently, or not Pump, Indigroo recently, and I'm still very angry about all this.
5536707	5538008	I played Indigroo today.
5538608	5539909	So did I. Yeah.
5540470	5541450	They sucked.
5542971	5543251	Oh well.
5544792	5552675	Oh yeah, that was funny, because on my first song I got a star, because I got like a 96% or something, and Secret's all, you got a star?
5553055	5554496	You can get a star in this game?
5555336	5557036	And I'm like, dude, they let you work on DDR?
5557296	5560057	My DDR skills have seriously declined.
5560478	5561418	But no, I think that's good.
5561438	5564259	That goes to show that you don't have to be a DDR expert.
5564839	5568760	or whatever to play, you know, you don't have to be able to triple A everything in order to work on DDR.
5568800	5584484	I haven't really played DDR, like, for real in years, so it's amazing that I even got an A-, or an S-, or whatever that crappy letter thing they had on in the groove was, but yeah, I'm just very bitter about this whole thing, and I don't want Pump It Up's name attached to, uh,
5585382	5588204	In The Groove, because I like Pump It Up and I don't like In The Groove.
5588284	5589305	But I like In The Groove songs.
5589945	5591226	Land of the Rising Sun is cool.
5592106	5594888	And that's... And The Roots, that's about it.
5595749	5596429	Yes, Loki.
5597670	5598550	Be good.
5598910	5604734	Why the hell would Endemiro want to, like, shame themselves, you know, by putting Pump It Up in front of this game?
5605214	5612039	I mean, honestly, unless... Unless, you know, the whole creative team behind Pump It Up went and redesigned their whole interface and said...
5612959	5615681	Okay, yeah, we like what you did, but we got a few... No, no, no.
5616161	5617842	Say what you will about the In The Groove interface.
5618102	5619964	Pumps is way worse.
5620204	5622145	Pump has one of the worst interfaces ever.
5622185	5623326	That is a lie.
5623386	5624366	That is a total truth.
5624386	5625647	That is a lie.
5625667	5626848	Pump It Up has it great.
5626948	5627929	I speak the truth.
5627989	5628389	Get over it.
5628669	5633312	They have the songs classified by channels, the Banya channel, the K-pop channel, and the pop channel.
5633352	5634533	You don't get much easier than that.
5634833	5639696	The only thing wrong with it is that you have to put all the codes in via your foot, and that gets annoying.
5640076	5649681	But also, when you're talking about In The Groove 2, having the codes with the feet to unlock the songs, Pump It Up does that too, so that's no surprise.
5650121	5650361	All right.
5651138	5656942	Which interface looks like it came out of my ass, and which one looks like it was actually worked on by a professional software team?
5657082	5657943	I would beg to differ.
5658143	5660044	I cannot stand Pump It Up's interface.
5660164	5660865	I hate it.
5660885	5661605	It's horrible.
5661665	5666208	Interface, technicalities aside, I'm not talking about the way the interface functions.
5666268	5668650	Just pure aesthetic value of it.
5668670	5671272	Why don't you just say, which game has run to you in it?
5671912	5673173	Because that sells me right there.
5673193	5673593	That's enough.
5673613	5674654	Pump It Up doesn't anymore.
5675274	5675815	Oh, that's true.
5677996	5679777	DarkSakura, you've been offered quiet over there.
5679817	5681398	What do you think about this whole debacle?
5682298	5685720	I'm not going to give any of them my business, so that's all there is to it.
5686260	5687260	I thought you liked Pump It Up.
5688941	5690442	I liked it before they sullied their name.
5692663	5693163	Oh, snap.
5693223	5695905	I think that kind of gives her opinion right there.
5696145	5700587	This would be like putting Dance Dance Revolution's George Foreman grill.
5700607	5702768	I mean, there's really no point in doing...
5704443	5708525	Now, hold on a minute, because I'm actually going to think this out here, okay?
5708585	5711086	Just be careful, there might be steam that arises from my head or something.
5711586	5712186	Now, let's see.
5713426	5714747	I have a dancing game.
5715747	5717368	I'm Andamiro, and I have a dancing game.
5717468	5721950	And it's not catching on the same way that my competitor's dancing game is catching on.
5722870	5724971	Okay, now, wait for a minute.
5725691	5727272	I am another company who...
5728584	5735570	borrowed heavily a lot of ideas from the competitor and put it into its own game and tried to improve upon it, and now I'm getting sued.
5735890	5739754	So here we are, we've got the number one, the king of dance games, Konami.
5739774	5741755	You can't dispute that, Konami sells the most.
5742296	5746900	You argue why you want the quality of the games, but in terms of sales, Konami is tops.
5747480	5753165	So number two and number three want to join forces to take out number one.
5754366	5755107	Where's the...
5756673	5760274	Where's the... That doesn't make sense in that, because it makes total sense to me.
5760394	5760874	It's war.
5761735	5762855	Yeah, it's number two and number three.
5762895	5763455	Ever pay risk?
5764556	5764836	Yeah.
5767237	5769557	Number two and number three are joining forces to take out number one.
5770198	5774419	Just like GameStop and EB merged to take out Walmart, right?
5775757	5778038	The thing is, though, this is only the arcade aspect.
5778398	5782259	I have not seen numbers on how well In The Groove has sold on the PS2.
5782639	5784099	DDR still sells really well.
5785419	5788220	Pump It Up still hasn't come out here yet, so we can't judge that.
5788960	5797122	So, they might fight for the dying arcade market, but who's to say that this collaboration will have any impact on the home version.
5797823	5798623	Okay, good point.
5799003	5803424	You can put 50 additional names in front of this goddamn game and it's still not going to make it one ounce better.
5805930	5807191	Just a big ball of hate, Loki.
5807751	5808412	Big ball of hate.
5810373	5810734	Alright.
5811014	5812375	In this case, it's a little deserved.
5814697	5815698	Alright, you guys.
5817079	5818800	This is why we lost all the listeners.
5818840	5820001	Hey, listen, listen.
5820061	5823003	If they make a good game, I'll give it, you know, good reviews.
5823063	5825445	But if the games suck, I'm going to tell you how it is.
5825465	5826086	Now, wait a minute.
5826146	5826686	Wait a minute.
5826866	5827327	Wait a minute.
5827387	5827727	Hello.
5828948	5832651	To the game's credit, you haven't played Pump It Up in the Groove 2 yet.
5832891	5833312	Correct?
5834032	5834873	So you don't know yet.
5835911	5838392	Are you going to give it at least one playthrough?
5838893	5839793	I'll play it once.
5840593	5840754	Once.
5841314	5844075	Just to get a taste of how crappy it is.
5844575	5847177	And then I'll just let you know how it is again.
5848735	5851076	But you have to go in there with an impartial view.
5851817	5856280	As the media... Let's put it this way.
5856460	5857120	Let me put it this way.
5857440	5863144	As I've seen how it started off as really shitty, it should be pretty easy to impress me then.
5863644	5865065	It's got to be better than crap.
5865305	5868207	Okay, so that's a pretty easy goal to hit.
5868587	5870689	If they can't do that, I'm sorry.
5870709	5871469	You're the media.
5871509	5874071	You need to be impartial like Fox News Channel.
5875231	5876471	Snicker, snicker, snort.
5877172	5880872	Yeah, only those dirty Republicans play in the group too, okay?
5885353	5885814	Is that better?
5885834	5886874	Is that impartial enough?
5889034	5890555	I don't know what to tell you anymore, Loki.
5890595	5893835	I just don't... Alright.
5897916	5898896	They can have their pump it up.
5899257	5900257	I have macadamia nuts.
5900617	5901117	Everyone's happy.
5902034	5903255	I hope this doesn't last.
5903735	5905556	I want them to split up really bad.
5905576	5907037	You want them to argue and fight about this?
5907097	5915721	Yeah, I want Andamira to realize their wrongs and punch Roxor in the face and take all their money, all four dollars.
5917282	5922365	I think the new cabinets are interesting.
5924729	5934983	I think they're kind of ugly, but I think they're interesting because they're really big, and I like big things, so I'm kind of curious to see what... They're so interesting, it's like putting a DDR pad on a pump-it-up cabinet.
5935043	5935944	Oh wait, that's what it is!
5938274	5943695	Wow, that's... How are we going to make this four panel with the pump-it-up cabinet?
5944815	5945475	Oh, I got it.
5945775	5946235	There we go.
5946495	5947096	That was easy.
5948496	5953397	And this way now, they can get around selling those boxers, because you can just put it in a pump cabinet and replace the pad.
5953457	5966039	Well, yeah, they're not going to get sued over this one, unless... Unless Andamiro's smart and realizes they're so horrible for doing this and decides to drop the name and then sue them for putting stuff in their arcade machines.
5966059	5967399	I hate Roxor.
5970437	5970717	Whatever.
5971878	5972258	Moving on.
5973419	5974861	In the group, fans, I'm sorry.
5975221	5979785	I tried to argue your case here, but Loki just won't budge one bit.
5979965	5980666	I'm sorry, guys.
5981086	5981627	What can I say?
5982648	5982968	All right.
5983869	5984870	Let's go on to a new topic.
5984890	5986591	Let's get into tonight's cage match, shall we?
5988573	5989253	Okay, we don't have to.
5990374	5992136	I was nodding, but no one heard it on the radio.
5992156	5992416	Sorry.
5992536	5992817	All right.
5996021	6012570	The way the Orange Lounge Radio Cage match works, we play three songs for you guys, one that each host selects, and the winning song, as voted by you guys, goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Video Game Music and More program, which plays 24 hours a day, seven days a week on this station.
6012671	6013431	We are not live.
6013911	6018874	So, you get to hear a clip of last week's song and two new songs in their entirety.
6018934	6020155	So let's hear first...
6021055	6022956	The song that won last week.
6023036	6023696	It's a clip.
6024777	6026518	It's a remix by Loki.
6027118	6029819	And it's echo image remix by Loki.
6030159	6032881	Skulk, the Misunderstood Mix is what it was called, I believe.
6033161	6033681	I don't remember.
6033721	6035442	I just renamed it again, so whatever.
6035462	6038483	Well, I think the MP3 says Misunderstood Mix, so that's what we're going to call it.
6038523	6040324	So here it is, a clip of song number one.

6168165	6170546	That was the song you guys voted as the winner last week.
6170606	6177528	Let's see if it can hang on two weeks in a row, or if it gets dethroned by one of the new entries in tonight's cage match.
6177548	6178669	I think I'll start tonight.
6179049	6180469	DarkSakura, you can bring up the rear.
6182650	6185011	Wait, isn't that supposed to... okay.
6185802	6187042	Yeah, ha ha ha, I get it.
6187062	6188343	Ha ha ha, I get it.
6188643	6188963	All right.
6189703	6196026	My choice tonight, I like that I Am Gothic song so much last week that I had to dig up some more songs by Spray.
6196406	6197646	And I really like this song.
6197726	6200367	And DarkSakura, I know you're going to like this one.
6200427	6200948	You have to.
6201408	6201868	You have to.
6201928	6202788	Do I have to?
6202808	6203348	You have to.
6203709	6206570	Because this is a song called I Kill With My Car.
6207710	6208370	I like it already.
6208510	6209251	All right, let's hear it.
6209331	6212572	Song number two in tonight's Cage Match, Spray with I Kill With My Car.
6285410	6290918	You're my baby, hot and sweet Hurling tension and thunder Grinding pets and kids to dust
6319135	6319977	Thanks for watching!
6348013	6349943	Thanks for watching!
6405219	6408023	Song number two, I Kill With My Car.
6409025	6410326	What do you think, DarkSakura?
6413151	6415234	I can't pull a Simon tonight, I'm sorry.
6416335	6417297	It gets to nine and a half.
6418263	6421025	Just because there was a bit of repetition, but it was pretty cool.
6421085	6422365	And you have to email that to me now.
6422546	6424367	Oh my god, she liked one of my songs.
6425047	6426388	It wasn't Crap Trance!
6427128	6430490	Every week, it's like, let's pick something really poppy.
6430650	6432291	I like a lot of Crap Trance.
6432351	6439515	Or Crap Trance, or less than Crap Trance, or what's your face?
6439895	6440616	Kelly Osbourne.
6442537	6443597	Which is just crap, period.
6443838	6446299	Alright, let's just see if I went over Loki.
6447489	6448130	You know what?
6448770	6449271	I'm sorry.
6449331	6451913	It's gonna get a 5 because it wasn't Crap Trance.
6452473	6456337	You know, I was really expecting Crap Trance, and this was not Crap Trance.
6456897	6458359	So, it gets a 5.
6458619	6459940	That and the fact- FUCK YOU BOTH!
6460120	6461121	FUCK YOU BOTH!
6461241	6462242	That's all I have to say.
6462362	6463063	Fuck you both.
6468047	6468528	Seegurd.
6469188	6468528	10.
6470069	6470509	Spray.
6470629	6471310	I like them.
6472171	6472851	Extifer.
6472991	6473512	What do you think?
6475097	6479039	5 years ago, I was on a rampage looking for Dr. Bombay stuff.
6479079	6483581	Instead, I downloaded a song which, to my delight, was by somebody that I really liked.
6483641	6486142	I downloaded a song by Del the Funky Homo Sapien called Dr. Bombay.
6504349	6517919	And I like the song, so, cause Del's cool So, and of course, this, I didn't even realize until after I picked the song And I already emailed it, I was like, oh, Gorillaz Connection, but Oh well, hey The song's cool What's new?
6518760	6531230	That's alright The song is cool So is Del the Funky Homo Sapien Alright, here it is, song number three Del the Funky Homo Sapien, Dr. Bombay Not related to the 2DX artist Dr. Bombay Right Alright, here we go
6554650	6557274	and I'm a pin the tail on the bump as anybody
6646926	6649633	The Force, y'all know who I am, so girl sing the chorus
6704582	6712486	And get up off your knees, everything that Dr. Bombay says It's guaranteed to make you say, so who's the side to hit?
6712626	6733378	I like club men hanging out with the Dems And girl, if you ain't got a turn I won't hesitate to pull out my funky puns But if you ain't down with Delfon Cancel your appointment and please get the hell on Cause I won't have fudge with gold Under my nose if you want 80% to close Get out my way so I can save the day Cause I'm Dr. Bombay
6814051	6817912	Okay, that was Dell the Funky Homo Sapien with Dr. Bombay.
6818012	6820653	Let's see if the doctor is in or out permanently.
6821133	6821914	DarkSakura.
6822934	6825895	I could have picked better, but I've been listening to this song a lot today, so it gets a 9.
6827475	6828516	All right, Loki.
6830596	6831777	It gets a 9, too.
6831817	6832317	It's pretty cool.
6834138	6835298	But it wasn't Trance.
6837482	6838843	You're an ass.
6838883	6840324	You're an ass.
6840384	6840724	Right?
6841885	6843086	He doesn't expect this from me.
6843126	6843226	Ass.
6843766	6844146	Sigurd.
6844967	6847068	It made me think of Bustamove and Ham.
6847649	6851071	So, if he were in another game, he would have had that as a theme song.
6851111	6851711	So it gets a 8.
6853892	6856874	That gets a resounding WTFF from me.
6857375	6859756	But, it was actually kind of funky.
6859836	6861417	It was like, what the funky fuck.
6861537	6862718	So, it wasn't bad.
6863658	6865540	I think they should have music like that in DDR.
6865560	6865820	Yeah.
6867798	6869139	I completely agree.
6870120	6872242	They need to mix the goth music up with stuff like that.
6873062	6873983	Make suggestions.
6874343	6875844	Zelda, Funky, Homo Sapiens.
6876045	6878486	See what I can do.
6878506	6882149	Can you write that on the next Scantron that goes and makes the DDR games?
6882169	6882690	That'd be great.
6884291	6884911	Oh, my score.
6884931	6887613	I guess I'd give it a, I don't know, like a 7.5.
6888514	6889014	It was neato.
6889375	6891016	Extaper, do you want to give a score on that one?
6891276	6892437	Zelda, Funky, Homo Sapiens?
6893604	6894605	I think I would give it a 9.
6896467	6896767	Alright.
6896807	6899029	Because I really enjoyed it.
6899049	6899629	When you moved?
6900090	6900550	Yes.
6900911	6901211	Alright.
6901311	6904073	Alright, remember it.
6904213	6906455	Our scores don't count, but yours do.
6906576	6909498	It's about time to vote, but first, let's recap your choices.
6909558	6913502	Song number one tonight, Echo Image, remixed by Loki, Skulk, Misunderstood.
6913562	6914082	Let's go.
6921809	6925993	Song number two you can vote for tonight is Spray with I Kill With My Car.
6936062	6940606	And song number three you can vote for tonight, Del the Funky Homo Sapien, Dr. Bombay.
6940846	6945711	A brother named George, that's the 151, so let's take you to the stage, you suck.
6948669	6951351	Place vote now.
6951531	6955754	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
6956094	6961217	And we'll announce the winner in a few moments here on Orange Lounge Radio.
6961497	6962798	What are you kids talking about back there?
6963038	6968321	I was saying that I found a whole bunch of CDs that I hope aren't warped, so I was going to try to burn myself a new car CD.
6968742	6973685	And that was going to go on it, so instead of being all Eurobeat driving in my Lancer, I'll be all...
6974525	6975346	Side to side.
6978047	6978667	You know what?
6978928	6988753	When I'm listening to that song, if I was driving and listening to this song, I think I would be like... Check and turn a signal to the left.
6988773	6991115	Check and turn a signal to the right.
6993696	6995497	Props to you if you get that reference, by the way.
6995537	6999120	How could you not get that reference?
6999160	7001161	You're an idiot if you don't get that reference.
7001281	7003082	I hope that folks in the chatroom get that.
7003817	7005578	But seriously, that's what it sounds like to me.
7007099	7012021	DarkSakura, when you do that, and you ride in the car, tell me that your mind will not do that.
7012081	7013181	Do the check, enter.
7013461	7018064	Now it was... I'm just gonna be all like, I'm gonna be like, shit, yeah, it's dealt.
7018324	7018984	Woohoo.
7020184	7020505	Alright.
7022386	7028969	This is the part of the show where we usually ask our buddy Loki what's going on in the sim scene, because lord knows I don't follow it.
7029269	7029589	Loki.
7029929	7032150	Well, I told you earlier what exactly happened.
7032886	7038890	The main thing that happened this week was that the In The Groove theme is released for Stepmania, and that is it.
7040390	7042532	No new Max 300 remixes of notes?
7044152	7044373	No.
7044853	7045133	Alright.
7047647	7057811	One thing I do want to ask you about then, since there's not a lot going on in the sim scene world, this kind of blurs the line here, this isn't necessarily DDR related, but we get to talk about other games when we want to on the show as well.
7058351	7061272	What is up with the PSP homebrew stuff?
7062332	7067794	I know it was released this week, how does it work, is it good, tell us about it, put down WarioWare for a minute, tell us about it.
7069352	7070552	Damn you, hit the pause button!
7071172	7071472	Thank you.
7071832	7072413	Ugh, fine.
7072753	7097357	Anyways, um, no, the whole thing with the homebrew stuff, basically, they found a workaround to get, you know, games to work on version 1.5 PSPs, and for those who don't know, the version 1.0 PSPs were the very first PSPs shipped in Japan, and those had a hole in it, and their encryption or whatever that allowed you to run your own homebrew
7098230	7099351	Code on PSPs.
7122978	7123418	and so on.
7142393	7152922	Now what they have available for is all the mainstream emulators out there so you can emulate Nintendo, the Super Nintendo, Genesis, Mega Drive.
7153502	7156465	Why is it so easy to port all these emulators over the PSP?
7156525	7158967	Is it because the PSP is like a mini PC or something?
7158987	7165332	No, it's just run off of, you basically adapt your code to whatever processor it is.
7165832	7172674	and I forget what kind it is, but it's basically just like, you know, the difference between the Nintendo DS and the Game Boy Advance.
7172734	7174675	It's just ARM 9 and ARM 7.
7174735	7176996	They're really almost the same processor.
7177376	7178836	So you only have to change your code a little bit.
7178856	7184218	It's like kind of programming in, say, C versus C++ or Visual C++.
7184238	7189220	There's a few different ways you program stuff, and so you have to program it differently for that.
7189753	7191056	and so it's easy to port it over.
7191236	7196486	Well now obviously this process doesn't take much time because I was looking at the emulators.
7197127	7197227	Now...
7198146	7198426	and so on.
7222742	7233289	I've even seen some, I don't know what exactly it is, like Quake and then Duke Nukem 3D, but I think those are just conversions or mods of Doom or something.
7234470	7240313	But those are available, and then you see actually people making basic programs like chess and tic-tac-toe and whatnot.
7241194	7242655	Those are available, and
7243664	7247307	Pretty much, you know, this is just going to keep going, you know.
7247627	7256033	And they've found a way, supposedly now, Sony's like, oh yeah, well we're going to try to make you upgrade again so this hole's closed so you can't do this.
7256654	7260397	But, you know, it's just something fun to do while you're waiting for more games to come out for the PSP.
7261459	7262460	It's really what it comes down to.
7278246	7279547	Is there a game out there that does that now?
7303695	7305896	You will not be able to decrypt our encryption.
7305956	7308157	That is just an invite for hackers to hack it.
7308537	7312059	So what's to say that 1.5.2 won't be cracked soon enough?
7312279	7313239	It just might.
7313459	7322323	Or what they might do is get away to where it doesn't matter what firmware you update it to, it'll bypass the whole encryption thing altogether.
7322503	7324044	Basically, just a workaround for it.
7325268	7338034	It's possible because, for example, earlier this week supposedly leaked on the internet was their entire library for all the library files for the PSP development kit.
7338314	7341895	So if you get a hold of that, you're going to see how everything works.
7341995	7344136	And it won't matter how many times you upgrade the firmware.
7344176	7348558	They're just going to have a way around it where it'll think it's like a version whatever.
7348598	7349939	It'll think it's a UMD or something.
7350299	7351320	We'll just get away around it.
7351460	7353741	In my opinion, this kind of sells PSPs.
7353801	7357083	I kind of want one even more now, knowing I can play Legend of Zelda on it.
7357383	7367009	They don't understand that, granted, they should just allow it to run homebrew code, but I don't think they want to be responsible for this kind of stuff.
7367029	7368950	So they have to actively try to
7369608	7369908	and so on.
7389520	7394422	But isn't it harder to get something on the DS because the DS doesn't have that whole memory stick thing?
7395042	7396623	Granted, it has the flash cards.
7396763	7398924	Yeah, the flash cards are the way you do that.
7399364	7404486	But I think what they're doing right now with the PSP, though, is they've got...
7405979	7415808	Well, some of the things I thought were pretty cool is you can actually overclock your PC in some of these games, because it is running, the chip's supposed to run at 333 MHz, but it actually runs at 222.
7416128	7423475	So some of these emulators, they actually have it where you can overclock it to 333, so it runs at what it's supposed to.
7424036	7427559	So it's just interesting to see what you can do with this.
7427619	7431663	And Beats of Rage is awesome, because it has so many different mods to it, so you can play like
7432473	7438477	It's basically a final fight, so you can do it with whatever characters you want, like Mega Man or Ghosts and Goblins.
7438517	7440218	I've seen some really strange mods out there.
7440599	7442980	Kill Bill, someone's made a mod for that.
7444121	7445222	So, it's interesting.
7445822	7446323	Interesting.
7447183	7458011	All I know is that when I saw Legend of Zelda being played, the first thing, and I know Sigrid thought of this, was that, oh my gosh, we could play Kid Icarus on the PSP, and that makes the PSP just totally worth having.
7458051	7461213	And I was just thinking about that too, and I was just kind of fantasizing.
7465304	7466605	Tell me this doesn't make you happy.
7468046	7468966	Damn you, Nintendo.
7469447	7471188	Damn you, Nintendo, for not putting out a sequel.
7471408	7475751	I can tell you pretty much it's going to be in goddamn Animal Crossing DS.
7475831	7476471	It's going to be.
7476591	7478612	It better be.
7479193	7479793	It better be.
7479833	7482275	I want a new Kid Icarus, though, and no 3D crap.
7482295	7486998	I want like a 2D... I just remember the old... What was that comic...
7487968	7492410	They don't do it anymore, but it was sort of like 8-bit theater.
7493711	7496072	But it had Mario and all the guys hanging out at the bar.
7496872	7500994	No one's talking about their upgrades, and Pip's like, Hey, I want one!
7501474	7502795	Sorry, you don't get one.
7504164	7510726	I remember Miyamoto saying something at E3 about he wants to put Kid Icarus on The Revolution, like a new one.
7511846	7513867	He just cock-teased what he is, honestly.
7514267	7521949	I'll take a tactics game or a first-person shooter with Pit, but so long as I get a Kid Icarus game, that's what matters.
7522409	7524450	I will not accept any of that crap.
7524630	7526911	I want a good old 2D...
7528391	7530652	I don't care if they did a good job with it.
7530672	7530932	It's fun.
7553393	7558814	But of course, people would just say that that's because I have this intense hatred for first-person shooters, which, you know, whatever.
7558834	7560375	Which is why you own Halo 1 and 2.
7560475	7562555	Yeah, yes, which is why I own Halo 1 and 2.
7565196	7565496	All right.
7567736	7570357	Let's find out who won tonight's cage match, shall we?
7571577	7575318	Tonight's cage match, the winner is... You guys ready for this?
7577327	7584730	It is a tie tonight, and it's our favorite kind of tie, boys and girls.
7584870	7587171	It's a three-way tie tonight!
7588772	7600357	So we gotta go look at the Orange Lounge Radio rulebook, and let's see here... Oh yes, I believe the way a three-way tie works, per the Orange Lounge Radio cage match rules, is that the...
7601628	7602688	Thank you for watching!
7624315	7625216	You gotta break a tie.
7625937	7626398	What's it gonna be?
7626438	7631326	Is it gonna be Spray I Kill With My Car or Dell the Funky Homo Sapien with Dr. Bombay?
7631766	7632467	Dr. Bombay.
7633048	7633649	Alrighty.
7633689	7638056	Dell the Funky Homo Sapien with Dr. Bombay in a very, very close vote tonight.
7644808	7647089	All right, check and turn and settle to the left.
7647129	7650989	That will be in rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio.
7651009	7660251	We'll come back for a chance at a second week victory, but boys and girls, songs that prevail in three-way ties very rarely last more than one week.
7660291	7661052	But we shall see.
7661132	7661672	We shall see.
7662572	7662852	All right.
7663272	7665113	Loki, you don't want your song to win anyway.
7666953	7668313	Oh, I like this in the chat room.
7668373	7669794	Sky's will is absolute.
7669894	7670354	I like this.
7670694	7671674	It makes me feel special.
7675915	7677216	Pardon me while I stroke my ego here.
7677496	7680738	We're going to go to a break, and when we come back from this break, we will be taking... Is that your ego?
7682519	7683199	You're disgusting.
7685120	7691864	When we come back from this break, we will take your calls on the Skype line, and of course we will get to the FUs of the week as well.
7691904	7696646	And I think that statement there brings a certain song to mind that needs playing.
7696706	7698588	So let's get to a little bit of DJ Taka here.
7698628	7700949	We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio.
7730533	7731354	Thanks for watching!
7790908	7791689	DarkSakura
7821556	7822636	Thanks for watching!
7876920	7877701	Thanks for watching!
8053928	8056349	DarkSakura, DarkSakura DarkSakura
8163257	8172615	And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.
8173363	8177445	Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.
8177465	8178425	Can we talk about that?
8178705	8181067	No subject will ever be taboo.
8181347	8184968	Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.
8185488	8188050	Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.
8188550	8193892	Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?
8194452	8195733	I collect your fucking head.
8197685	8199187	Just like this fucker here.
8200288	8203971	Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?
8204251	8207634	The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!
8208575	8215021	Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!
8216263	8219966	Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.
8223888	8225629	God damn, we need new promos.
8226229	8229210	We need to make our listeners do the work for us, honestly, because we're kind of lazy.
8229230	8230030	I have an idea for one.
8230350	8230590	Do you?
8230930	8231131	Yeah.
8231711	8235492	We need to make a thread in our super secret forum and keep these ideas flowing.
8235512	8238753	Because sometimes I think of ideas at work and then I forget to write them down and then they're gone forever.
8238773	8241374	I have to sneak onto the webpage to be able to update at work.
8241394	8241774	That's right.
8241794	8243455	Well, you can always send me an email and I'll post it for you.
8243475	8243555	Okay.
8243575	8244435	Because you can do that.
8244715	8246496	Isn't that weird that you can do email but you can't do internet?
8247074	8258244	The email that doesn't work half the time, because the thing of the way that the email at my work is, is that there's supposed to be some server to block outside mail, which actually only works half of the time and never works on you.
8260946	8261807	I always get your email.
8264349	8268133	And no, none of you in the chat room get my work email, so, sod off.
8270379	8273281	Alright, Skype line is open if you guys want to give us a call.
8273581	8277565	www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on Interact With Us.
8277605	8279667	And look at that, it's lighting up already.
8280348	8282570	I think our listeners are starting to understand that when they don't call in...
8283424	8284824	that Paris Hilton is going to come up.
8284884	8286205	So they're getting smart.
8286245	8287025	So we have a call.
8287345	8288525	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8289826	8291546	Hi, Sephiroth 1215 here.
8291946	8293187	Hello, Sephiroth 1215.
8293607	8296468	And I know you're calling in to talk about that new Paris Hilton Carl's Jr.
8296488	8297108	commercial, right?
8298648	8299828	Yeah, of course.
8299848	8301429	That's pretty cool.
8301509	8302409	That's hot, huh?
8303629	8304910	Oh, yeah, it is.
8305470	8306770	All right, enough BS.
8306790	8307270	What's on your mind?
8309811	8311592	I don't know, just some random stuff, I guess.
8313528	8319172	Last week I got the In The Groove and Afterburner Pad bundle What'd you think?
8319252	8338446	Because honestly I haven't picked up In The Groove yet And that has nothing to do with Loki's distaste of the game rubbing off on me or anything It's just that I actually don't have an American PS2 And I don't want to mod my Japanese one because I know I will fuck it up So I am kind of waiting until I can afford an American PS2 So I'm curious, how's the game?
8340040	8346245	It's okay, it's going to hold me over until like September, you know, when Extreme 2 comes out.
8346926	8354873	Not to mention, with the Afterburner pad, I have to basically go back to all the other games and get new scores on them, so I'm pretty good this summer.
8355773	8357054	What do you think of the Afterburner pad?
8357074	8358536	That's the brand new metal pad, right?
8358596	8359897	So how's that working out for you?
8361134	8366117	At first, I thought it wasn't worth the money, but once I broke in the arrows, everything was perfectly fine.
8366397	8367057	It works great.
8368298	8369238	I have a lot of fun with it.
8369578	8371879	How much are your scores improving on the old games?
8374441	8375641	Pretty much by a whole grade.
8376522	8376822	Awesome.
8377435	8377755	Good stuff.
8378295	8379936	Sigurd, I have a curious question.
8379976	8386099	I don't know if you can answer this or what, but when you guys are testing the game at Konami, I know you guys don't actually... We use softpads.
8386819	8388600	You do play Konami softpads?
8388760	8390180	Oh, you use the official Konami pads.
8390200	8391061	You don't use the other product.
8391121	8393542	I was just curious if you ever use the metal stuff.
8393602	8396003	I'll tell you why after we're off the air.
8396596	8402802	I'm just going to some old stuff now.
8402822	8406505	I just got Star Ocean since it went to a greatest hits price.
8406546	8406686	Mm-hmm.
8418837	8421299	I love that when the games get cheaper because they're greatest hits.
8421879	8423200	That's usually when I end up buying them.
8425121	8425382	Awesome.
8425402	8427083	And it's been happening rapidly.
8427763	8430285	Okay, anything else you wanted to call in tonight, ask us about?
8430445	8433627	Any questions for us here in studio or Sigurd, our guest, or whatever?
8435769	8436249	Not really.
8437110	8437850	I guess I'm good now.
8438130	8439071	Alright, sounds good.
8439111	8440132	Well, thank you for calling in.
8441473	8441873	No problem.
8441993	8442674	Alright, anytime.
8442734	8443134	Have a good one.
8443936	8444237	You too.
8444337	8444677	Bye.
8446080	8446420	All right.

8459028	8461610	While we're waiting for another call, if we get one, I don't know.
8461791	8463432	Like I said, our listeners are down.
8463452	8467796	I don't know if it's just college or they're studying for finals or graduating or whatever's going on in your neck of the woods.
8469097	8473000	I want to mention real quick that we actually have a live journal system set up.
8473040	8475883	Now, you guys know about our live journal community at Orange Lounge.
8475903	8478385	Well, I didn't know about this until tonight.
8478825	8486692	One of our listeners, Arcadian42, is also a frequent guest of the show, actually created an Orange Lounge radio program.
8487700	8489241	OLR underscore podcast
8516599	8525484	And if you want to be able to find the whole link there, it's just www.livejournal.com slash users slash OLR underscore podcast.
8525504	8531307	So if you add that username to your friends list over on LiveJournal, then you will know when new podcasts are posted.
8531327	8536510	You also get the brief little description about what we talk about on each one, our little synopsis.
8537510	8538090	So check that out.

8541403	8545566	Vote for us over on PodcastAlley.com because we appreciate your vote.
8545886	8549829	And there's also another We Need Your Help type thing I will talk about a little later.
8550109	8553751	I'm going to bring that up in a few minutes here after we get through some other stuff.
8556413	8561777	I do not see any other calls coming in, so I guess that's it.
8562517	8565920	There's quite a few people online, so I'm kind of surprised that nobody else wants to call, but that's fine.
8566520	8567882	A question from our chat room, though.
8567902	8569363	I think this one's more for DarkSakura.
8570084	8572126	When does the podcast Poop Shoot go live?
8573488	8574048	You know what?
8575069	8575850	I've been busy.
8576611	8577812	Did you turn on my microphone?
8577872	8578333	Yeah, you're on.
8578720	8579781	You turned up my microphone, though.
8579981	8580461	No, it's not up.
8580501	8580981	It's too loud.
8582002	8583203	I turned up the in-house speakers.
8583263	8584123	Okay, turn this up, please.
8584383	8585144	Sorry.
8587145	8590087	Hearing the reverb gives me instant headaches.
8590107	8593148	I have to turn it up to hear the calls on Skype.
8593269	8601333	Alright, at any rate, if you come over to my house and pack up all my crap and move it to my new house, then maybe I'll make it.
8602694	8602854	So...
8604776	8606657	or pay for the domain for me, I don't know.
8607457	8612739	I'm still looking for someone to take the domain I registered and never used for Death Cake.
8614040	8616101	And you could make a pornography site out of it if you want.
8616361	8616961	No, that's okay.
8617021	8620363	I actually registered lastlivingsouls.com.
8621943	8624905	So anyways... Our chat room is saying they're all shy.
8624945	8626406	They don't want to call in and be on air tonight.
8626466	8626906	Fine.
8627726	8629107	At least we got the one guy.
8629227	8634090	If you don't call in, I will come over to your house and personally kick your butt until you call in.
8634390	8635431	We did get one person.
8635671	8636712	No, no, no, no, no, no.
8636732	8638933	Well anyways, the thing I was working on before...
8639383	8654272	See, before when I was playing around with this program called RPG Maker 2003, the thing that I didn't like about it the most was having to draw all the sprite graphics and stuff, and that really kind of frustrated me because I had really good ideas, but I didn't want to have to draw everything because that takes way too much time.
8654352	8655072	I hate drawing, too.
8655352	8656313	I'm just not good at it.
8656393	8660935	Especially since plotting out an RPG is way too much work as it is.
8663340	8669923	I figured I'd go ahead and play around the program some more because the mods for Beats of Rage actually have sprites in them.
8670344	8671084	So that's kind of nice.
8671244	8673365	So I'm stealing those because I'm lazy.
8673905	8677487	So, I am making an RPG.
8677667	8678147	It'll be fun.
8679248	8680168	Oh wait, is that your new project?
8680369	8681049	That's my new project.
8681069	8681709	Alright.
8681949	8683390	But, the best part.
8683990	8684491	We're in it.
8685251	8685891	Oh great.
8686291	8691054	Wait, did you just... As the collective groan arises from the studio...
8692335	8694137	DarkSakura, you look frightened by that.
8694237	8695038	I can draw, you know.
8696079	8699963	Well, I know, but I don't need you guys to draw anything.
8700223	8702246	Oh, oh, you don't need us.
8702506	8703567	You don't need our help.
8703927	8704288	Fine.
8704768	8706650	I hope your project sucks.
8707891	8712396	I figured out who the villain's going to be, though, but I can't say because it's going to be funny.
8712657	8712997	Trust me.
8713248	8715190	Yeah, I know who you would make the villain.
8715210	8716951	You'd make the villain, like, Roxor or something.
8716971	8717732	Anyway, we got a call.
8718032	8718273	What?
8718453	8719414	Bigger than Roxor.
8719714	8720134	Oh, boy.
8720214	8720555	Here we go.
8720575	8721255	All right, we got a call.
8721496	8722857	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8726081	8727482	Okay.
8727502	8727963	That's it.
8728023	8729604	I go back to spamming the chat room.
8729624	8731746	Now you're not on Orange Launch Radio.
8733708	8735189	So anyways, as I was talking about the game.
8735409	8736550	Well, F you too.
8736750	8737551	I see how it is.
8737851	8744798	Think Kingdom Hearts minus the Disney characters and all the console characters.
8745078	8746299	Like a lot of console characters.
8747188	8749209	and just have random villains in it.
8749509	8753872	But there's one big villain that's in charge of everything and he's the worst video game villain.
8753892	8755153	It's Mr. Spanky, isn't it?
8755173	8756394	No, it's not Mr. Spanky.
8756994	8757274	Bigger.
8758015	8758595	Yeah, I think bigger.
8760478	8761018	I don't know.
8761379	8762159	I can't give it away.
8762219	8765021	I'm not going to give any hints only because it's hilarious.
8765381	8774747	And I've got another person making a cameo in this who's related to our show but not... I can't say.
8775147	8776167	It'll be funny.
8776207	8776648	Trust me.
8776768	8777188	It's great.
8777568	8784412	I'm going to work on it but I can't say too much more about it because I don't know if I'll ever finish it or get the urge to actually work on it.
8785233	8788355	But I'm hopefully going to have it done within like a year.
8789995	8790515	A year?
8791376	8795416	Hey, I'm giving- Quit your job and do this full time, this is more important.
8796457	8798457	It'll be cool when it's done, okay?
8798477	8802698	The walking around, like, overworld music needs to be, like, the Goonies song.
8802718	8807639	We're gonna have- There's gonna be evil characters in, like, I've already- I've already decided there's gonna be evil Ken.
8808059	8809840	He's gonna be one of the characters you have to fight in it.
8809920	8810740	How about evil Rob?
8810760	8812240	There's gonna be emo Dan.
8813240	8814641	Like- Dan from Street Fighter?
8814881	8815701	Oh, I thought maybe- No.
8815981	8816221	Oh yeah!
8818541	8821262	Because he's kind of depressed as it is, so I thought that would be funny.
8821362	8824084	I'd like to see emo Dan who manages the GameStop.
8824824	8825765	That would be a fun character.
8825785	8826925	I can make that character Dan.
8826945	8829606	That's angry Dan who manages the GameStop.
8829666	8831787	I know, that's why it's funny to be emo Dan.
8831867	8836350	It'll be funny, it'll have references from stuff, it'll have inside jokes, it'll be great.
8837030	8840892	And it'll just have, like, you know, fun stuff, you know.
8841932	8842252	Alright.
8842353	8847355	Like DarkSakura will summon an attack that will involve the gorillas, you know.
8848840	8850241	Yeah, the jeep comes running out.
8850261	8852461	Yeah, I'll run over whoever.
8853102	8854022	Your mic going crazy.
8854042	8855342	Yeah, I know.
8855382	8856143	What's up with that?
8856583	8856883	All right.
8858344	8858724	All right.
8859124	8860745	Jamie, don't bother berating the chat room.
8860765	8861925	We've got other things to get to.
8861985	8865306	We'll just... They can be shy if they want.
8865386	8868808	Actually, I think the person who tried to call in was saying that their settings were screwed up.
8868828	8872369	But we'll open it up again after this.
8872589	8872749	What?
8872789	8873289	Are you okay?
8873409	8875070	I can only breathe through one nostril.
8875689	8876189	It sucks.
8876389	8876970	Sorry to hear that.
8877250	8879491	Well, it sounds like you're ready to do some venting, aren't you?
8881792	8884173	So I think we need to get to the FUs of the week, don't we?
8887114	8891056	So, DarkSakura, why is it that we do the FUs of the week every single freaking week?
8891276	8892417	Grr, argh.
8903639	8905879	Dude, I love my FU music now.
8905959	8908220	It's Angel's Thanatos from Silent Hill 2.
8909061	8909661	Like, awesome.
8910941	8914783	Anyway, uh, my first FU goes to dust.
8916003	8919504	Goes to throwing away shit I wanted to keep, except I'm too pack-ratty.
8920545	8922105	Uh, FU to dust again.
8922705	8925306	FU to my nostril being plugged on one side.
8925326	8929848	Um, FU to food.
8932069	8933811	Um, F you to the pizza that I ate yesterday.
8933831	8937154	Uh, crap.
8937634	8940596	F you to the 50 boxes sitting in my living room.
8941137	8944019	And the fact that my cat is afraid of everything now.
8944920	8948223	She's been living in her litter box since we started moving all those boxes downstairs.
8948643	8950825	And why the fuck do I have so much stuff?
8951626	8956030	I swear, I trip it over controllers and video game systems and the cat.
8956990	8958711	and, like, RC cars.
8958811	8960372	We found our initial DRC cars.
8960413	8961994	You didn't pack Shermie, did you?
8962374	8962874	No.
8963374	8966116	Shermie will pack herself in her litter box until we're moved.
8966556	8973221	Then, at the point that we are at the new location, she will proceed to live in her litter box for a week, like she did the last two times.
8975049	8977009	Jeremy has been with us through one move already.
8977690	8978610	She knows things.
8979110	8982431	She knows this is a strange place that dogs used to live at.
8983111	8991213	Oh yeah, I'm probably going to have to endure a couple weeks worth of allergies from chows and cigarette smoke that used to reside in the house.
8993193	8994353	They had smoking dogs.
8994693	8995693	No, but he smoked.
8995733	8997774	Well, I know he stopped smoking once the baby was born.
8999249	9002251	Baby Killers Or do you have the ones that actually do smoke themselves?
9021721	9023121	Britney was smoking while she was pregnant.
9023762	9024922	Well, she didn't know she was pregnant, right?
9025322	9026762	No, she was pregnant.
9026822	9027623	What a dumbass.
9028023	9029263	It's because she's a stupid bitch.
9029363	9029783	I'm sorry.
9030203	9033504	She can't have a smart baby because how else will they grow up to be a pop singer?
9034805	9035105	True.
9035245	9036425	Sorry to derail that.
9036465	9036825	I'm sorry.
9040046	9041987	Back to you and your thoughts.
9042207	9042947	I'm done.
9043807	9044707	Fuck you, baby killer!
9045207	9046268	Alright, let's go to Loki.
9049793	9051635	Fuck you to my stomach for being empty.
9052015	9053797	I want food, and I don't have food.
9054177	9057540	So I gotta, you know, find food at home, which I'm sure we don't have food there yet.
9057660	9059362	I have some dam in the kitchen.
9059642	9060543	I want a dam.
9062605	9066108	Dam, by the way, is D apostrophe A-I-M, and it's little miniature heat parts.
9066128	9069070	It's delicious, I gotta know that cue.
9069471	9071232	Another reason why I wouldn't want that.
9071352	9071973	No, but, um...
9073442	9076584	Fuck you, the stupid people, especially driving on the road.
9077445	9080047	I swear to God, people don't use their turn signal or anything.
9080087	9082008	It's like, why do we even add them to the cars?
9082748	9083569	You're not going to use them.
9084249	9086471	Whatever, but... Fuck you, that.
9086831	9097158	And to the goddamn onions I had on my burger at lunch, because I still smell them on me after I've brushed my teeth a few times and washed my hands repeatedly.
9097418	9099280	They still smell like onion.
9100621	9102442	It's like that's just toxic or something, and I...
9103004	9103685	I don't know what to do.
9104986	9106427	And that's about it.
9106987	9107988	My turn.
9114830	9124832	I want to give an F you to Nintendo for fucking being a bunch of dicks in WarioWare Twisted and putting in that Kid Icarus record and saying, Ha ha, this is the closest thing you're going to get to a sequel.
9125112	9129133	Well, ha ha, I hate you and I'm not going to buy any of your crappy products ever again.
9129453	9131314	Except Nintendogs because Nintendogs is really cute.
9131394	9132594	And I kind of want Meteos too.
9133554	9134335	But you suck.
9134375	9134995	You still suck.
9135035	9135795	I hate you, Nintendo.
9137355	9140816	Yes, we're all going to have Nintendogs and our puppies are all going to play with each other.
9140836	9141896	F you to trendiness.
9142256	9144017	F you to all you being trendy.
9146030	9148172	I was the first at being trendy.
9148292	9154396	You all are... DarkSakura is giving me the don't go there hand.
9155377	9157278	F you to the don't go there hand.
9157839	9163703	F you to me being lazy because I need to get to the gym and work out because I need a nice body and not a fat one.
9163843	9165184	So that's it.
9166345	9168466	Let's go to Sigurd.
9168506	9169487	Do you have any F yous of the week?
9171300	9172921	I love that song.
9173221	9176562	I have no FUs this week.
9177242	9177862	You have nothing?
9178103	9181404	I have like a work-related thing I can't do over the air, but that's it.
9181704	9182984	I'm pretty happy.
9183064	9186305	So I just do the FU to general work angst.
9186445	9186906	That's alright.
9187126	9188606	FU to trance music.
9188806	9189386	There we go.
9189486	9191947	Generic, boring trance music.
9192808	9193608	Big FU to that.
9193808	9194068	Alright.
9194088	9194368	That's it.
9194588	9195028	Sounds good.
9195669	9197429	Extafur, do you have any FUs you want to give?
9198970	9199430	Don't lurk.
9200405	9204549	Um, fuck you to 300 pound chicks at Walmart.
9205730	9206090	Okay.
9206731	9207071	The end.
9209233	9210774	How about F you to moomoos in general?
9210794	9211715	I don't like moomoos.
9212055	9214518	Alright, let's go to the chat room and see what they have to say.
9216499	9219702	Uh, Chimera says, F you to crayons.
9219862	9220163	Why?
9220443	9220843	Why not?
9221864	9223466	I happen to like crayons, personally.
9224326	9225868	This tastes like purple!
9227441	9229964	Dark Knight says, My FU goes to this weekend.
9229984	9231025	Be short.
9231045	9232086	I so didn't want it to end.
9232106	9233787	Misty says, My first FU is to cage match.
9246348	9248931	Thank you for recognizing what Live Journal is for.
9262367	9268448	StupidBaka says, nephew to some random guy that almost hit me on Friday while I was walking to City College for class.
9268869	9272169	He almost hit me and even dared to yell, get out of the way, you fucking punk.
9272609	9279111	So, of course, I got out of the way, and when he drives like half a block and stops to look back at me saying, watch for cars, dumbass.
9279491	9284712	So, of course, I flip him the bird and yell at him to watch his shit, because I scratched his car in a lightning bolt.
9287355	9289036	I stretched this car in a lightning bolt.
9289397	9290097	That doesn't make sense.
9290698	9291878	So yeah, fuck you to drivers.
9293960	9296202	DarkTetsuya says, F you to myself.
9296342	9298443	I fried my PlayStation by dropping it.
9298864	9299244	Whoops.
9301366	9306950	You know, I fried my GameCube because I was trying to play WarioWare Twisted in the Game Boy Player and it just, it wasn't working.
9308331	9312274	Doops says, F you to Orlando being so damn far from where I live.
9312634	9315817	And F you to DrawnTogether for making Gay Link funny.
9317985	9319106	Short FU list today.
9319366	9320566	Because Xander was Gay Link.
9322227	9326269	Didn't that show come on like eight months ago and hasn't done anything since?
9326649	9327549	Yeah, pretty much.
9327709	9329430	Some people are just a little slow, it's alright.
9330070	9332011	Maybe the DVDs just came out or something, I don't know.
9332471	9333151	Maybe, I don't know.
9333371	9334252	I would get on that.
9334852	9336133	No.
9336153	9337313	Apparently not, so.
9338934	9341135	I totally would buy Drawn Together DVDs, that's awesome.
9341155	9341975	Alright.
9341995	9342215	Alright.
9345222	9345642	PodcastAwards.com
9372118	9374679	We're trying to get ourselves nominated.
9374900	9381103	Originally, I wasn't going to push for this one because there was just a general technology category.
9381803	9387786	There's no point because Leo Laporte and This Week in Tech would just whoop everybody's ass, so there's really no point.
9387826	9389127	We were just not even going to try.
9389187	9397371	Now, in going to podcastawards.com, we find that they have added a new category for Best Gaming Podcast.
9400102	9401403	I cast a spell!
9401643	9407087	So, you know, vote your conscience, but remember that we like people who help us out.
9407147	9410449	So, go to podcasting, is it podcasting?
9410529	9415593	No, podcastawards.com, all one word, and click on the big nominate now.
9415733	9419035	By the way, it's the very last category listed on the page, way in the bottom right.
9419455	9419855	Gaming.
9420356	9424839	And just fill that in, you just put your email address, orangeloungeradio2go.com
9425559	9428860	and our website and the XML and any other comments you want.
9429160	9432461	If you don't know the XML, I will post that information in the chat room in a little bit.
9432501	9436821	So we appreciate all your help because we like getting stuff.
9437042	9437442	It's cool.
9438462	9439022	Like awards.
9439702	9441162	I'm doing it right now.
9441222	9445703	And I'm hoping that the podcast awards are actually filled with chocolate or something because that would be cool.
9448004	9451425	Like if the podcasting awards were actually made out of solid milk chocolate or something.
9451885	9452405	I could eat it.
9452585	9453185	That would be yummy.
9453979	9454860	or MadeOutOfDamn.
9455440	9455981	That would be great.
9457602	9457982	All right.
9458323	9459383	We're going to go to another break.
9459443	9462986	When we come back from this break, we're going to do some Ask Orange Lounge.
9463587	9464127	That's right.
9464227	9467410	Send in your questions over private message to Sky in the chat room.
9467830	9473675	It's your chance to take over the show and ask us any questions that you want.
9474416	9474696	All right.
9475336	9476918	So we will be back.
9478012	9481155	After this break, and in this break, I think we need to hear some Parapara.
9481455	9484198	Because I'm feeling a little sluggish here, and I want to wake up.
9484979	9486280	I need to wake up a little bit here.
9486400	9490604	So we'll start it off with Jamie's request here, and we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio.
9490624	9494268	For those of you guys in chat, I will post more information on how to vote for us on Podcast Awards.
9494588	9495429	We'll be back after this.
9587655	9588605	Thanks for watching!
9631753	9632895	Thank you for watching!
9670779	9671823	and many more.
9730396	9731277	Thank you for watching!
9807182	9808506	Thank you for watching!
9867017	9871180	Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
9871400	9873121	Do we want to be accepted by Hollywood?
9873162	9875823	No!
9875923	9877284	Do we care what people think of us?
9877925	9879746	No!
9879786	9881227	Do we want people to kiss our ass?
9881708	9884630	Yes!
9885791	9890574	Extreme Bomani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.
9892025	9894047	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
9894127	9899151	Loki, I found more information on that thing you brought up earlier about in the groove and the whole crash thing.
9899231	9902253	It's actually in a story that was posted over on DDRFreak.com.
9902894	9909079	It talks about the game will crash on autoload, basically corrupting a player's saved game.
9909419	9918046	All you have to do, if the top grade sorting order is selected as the default sort order, then the game crashes.
9919025	9919966	So that's how to do it.
9919986	9921387	If you want to crash your game.
9922268	9923489	So, just thought I'd share that with you.
9924070	9927052	I know you're too busy playing WarioWare to give a shit, but I just thought I'd share.
9927072	9931857	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
9933438	9935500	We're going to get to Ask Orange Lounge momentarily.
9935961	9943127	Don't forget to send in your questions in the chat room over at www.orangeloungeradio.com and we'll get to your questions.
9947068	9950570	I was going to bring up another story, but I decided not to.
9950670	9952512	So that leaves me at a loss for words.
9952572	9957415	DarkSakura, why don't you plug our other nightly shows that go on here on Orange Lounge Radio.
9957555	9963939	There's Pump Up the Volume on Tuesday night, although this week, gee, I may not be able to do a show.
9964559	9965040	It depends.
9965140	9967041	If I do, I'll play a bunch of comedy.
9967421	9968442	But usually I play whatever.
9968482	9969563	If you're hanging out in the chat room...
9970143	9974544	You can request whatever it starts with the pre-show at a quarter to seven Pacific time.
9974564	9978365	The show starts at 7.30 to 10.30 and it's really random every time.
9978385	9983366	If you want to hear something new, unusual, something you might not normally listen to, check it out.
9985227	9986167	Alright, sounds good.
9988487	9994649	In the Groove, of course, since it made its recent debut on the PlayStation 2, it's kind of...
9995871	9996652	www.orangeloungeradio.com
10016383	10024126	And it's kind of neat because it compares the games DDR and In the Groove and kind of talks about, you know, how the games are different.
10024587	10033751	It's kind of interesting because the only people that won't say that In the Groove is kind of a loose adaptation of DDR or whatever is Rocksoar and Red Octane themselves.
10034451	10035451	They just kind of ignore it there.
10036112	10040234	But they post a nice review and that's kind of interesting that it actually gets coverage in Wired Magazine.
10040714	10041154	I like that.
10043535	10045296	What are you giggling at over there, Loki?
10046826	10052748	I was playing one level of the WarioWare and I got to like level 60 and the music got so fast it was funny.
10054209	10056450	I was doing the hamster ED thing and that was fun.
10057030	10058611	I'm glad you were able to do that.
10058631	10066894	You know what's one I could probably rock at is the one where you have to hold it still so you just like leave your Game Boy Advance just sitting there.
10068855	10069675	Which I'm going to try that one.
10069975	10072196	What if it requires you to have it at a certain angle?
10073697	10076598	I don't think that's the case but I'll try it.
10077685	10102312	One other plug I want to get in regards to In The Groove stories, and I know we have a listener that writes for this website, and he actually wrote this review, so he'll like that I'm giving this a plug, but honestly, InsidePulse.com, specifically Games.InsidePulse.com, they actually posted a review by one of our listeners, El Mullet, who writes for this website, did a review of In The Groove, and in my opinion, this...
10103274	10104874	Freaking sums it up perfectly.
10105314	10108315	This is honestly the best review.
10108395	10111496	This would be exactly how I feel about the game.
10112016	10112356	Mostly.
10112396	10116657	I think there was one or two things I disagreed with, but it's almost 100% exactly how I feel about the game.
10116677	10117197	And it's fair.
10117537	10122158	It talks about what is good about Indigroove and what's not so good about Indigroove and all that.
10122578	10123938	Check it out if you're curious.
10124038	10125158	InsidePulse.com.
10125319	10126259	I totally endorse it.
10126279	10127239	I think it's a great review.
10128119	10131682	Let's go and go to the Skype line because we actually just got a call on Skype.
10131702	10133143	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10134824	10136965	This is your resident ninja spy, Dark Knight.
10137185	10139487	Hello, our ninja spy, Dark Knight.
10139527	10141168	What is on your mind tonight?
10142369	10142889	Nothing much.
10142909	10143770	Just a little bit tired.
10143810	10148593	Just got back from a convention around town this weekend.
10148893	10152595	You sound a little drained like you just went to a convention or something.
10152615	10154176	You sound a little out of it, but that's all right.
10154277	10154877	How was the convention?
10155922	10157883	Oh, it was pretty good, actually.
10157943	10160363	I went to see the cosplay for the first time.
10160423	10163684	There was a pretty interesting cosplay skit that was going on at the convention.
10163844	10164765	Now, which convention is this?
10165885	10166905	Anime Mid-Atlantic.
10167345	10168726	Oh, Anime Mid-Atlantic, alright.
10168846	10171107	So, what kind of stuff were they doing at this convention?
10171127	10172887	What were the big shows and big things to see?
10175088	10182550	Well, like I said, during the cosplay, there was one skit they had on there, which was like a Final Fantasy bit, where they had a
10183388	10186269	Black Mage, White Mage, and Warrior fighting the Toonberry.
10187110	10188190	And it was hilarious.
10188250	10193913	It was like, of course, a typical Toonberry, when you attack it, it's almost impossible to get a single hit off of it.
10195013	10196474	And it was just getting hilarious every time.
10196494	10198215	I was killing everybody off and everybody like that.
10198495	10202697	At the end, you see a guy come out holding a sign saying, Toonberry gains like 5,000 experience.
10204749	10206910	540 Guild, and Get Pizza x4.
10206970	10212612	Did the Tomberry do the little Final Fantasy victory dance that they did in Final Fantasy where they just raised their arms up repeatedly?
10212632	10212992	Yeah.
10213272	10214713	Oh, that's awesome.
10214733	10214873	Yeah.
10215213	10215773	It was great.
10216534	10220755	And there was one cosplay that was really, really good.
10220775	10221336	What's that?
10221696	10223136	It was beautifully performed.
10223196	10226418	I wish I knew what it was, but let me put it this way.
10227198	10232340	It involved a lot of people and flag-waving displays, and it was beautifully done.
10233127	10237371	and I don't know if it might have won or not, but apparently it was great.
10237631	10241735	Maybe there'll be pictures on the internet at some point or something so you can share that with us later.
10242036	10247781	Hey, I gotta ask, because no anime convention is incomplete without a hentai room.
10247801	10248642	Was there a hentai room?
10250248	10252430	No, actually, unfortunately not.
10252530	10253110	Yes!
10254311	10262317	Unfortunately not, but yeah, when they had the raid portion, yeah, the emergency list kind of started piling up as the raid went on during the night.
10262657	10263417	I see, I see.
10263538	10266440	So, anything else you want to share about the convention?
10267400	10273825	Well, at the end of the convention, the last day it was today, there was a big announcement about where it was going next year.
10274757	10279460	Apparently, they actually are going to go to a big convention hall.
10279821	10283163	Anime Midnight next year will be at the Richmond Convention Center.
10283623	10284083	Okay.
10284744	10295791	Now, note, I think AMA is mostly like a local small con that's hosting a hotel, but apparently it's gotten so popular now that they decided to move it to the convention center, which is huge.
10295911	10298293	In fact, when the announcement came down, the whole...
10298952	10300795	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10316513	10319615	Yeah, it's a pretty cool convention.
10319796	10321357	You meet some great guests.
10321397	10325860	In fact, one of the voice artists is actually a local guy who you might have heard of.
10325880	10327240	If you remember some of his shows, Greg Ayers.
10343610	10344611	And what's he known for?
10357495	10362358	Most of all the big shows, big enemies that they have out there, he done voice works for most of them.
10362578	10366620	You might have heard his voice once or twice on Evangelion maybe as well.
10367761	10368901	I try not to watch that.
10369161	10369822	Ava dubbed.
10371963	10373844	But he's pretty good.
10374204	10377486	He's like one of the main people out of ADV.
10377506	10379607	Who is it again?
10379647	10380187	Who is it again?
10383700	10384300	Greg Ayers.
10384580	10384940	Oh, okay.
10385621	10389021	I don't know why for a moment I had someone else's name stuck in my head.
10389962	10397824	But like I said, he's a local, and like I said, for him to blow up like that is great, and to see a local guy actually succeed like that is really, really cool.
10398544	10399224	I actually met him.
10399244	10400144	He's a really cool guy.
10400664	10405786	So like I said, I mean, I love his work, and I hope he does a lot more.
10405806	10406686	I'll say it that way.
10407648	10408528	All right, very cool.
10408809	10409809	Well, congratulations.
10410009	10412610	The con was a big success, and who knows?
10412750	10414991	Hopefully we can come out to one of those cons one of these days.
10415051	10415492	We'll see.
10416012	10417913	We've got to let you go because we're going to get to some Ask Orange Lounge.
10418913	10419393	All right, hold on.
10419413	10420734	I'm going to throw a shameless plug in.
10420914	10421574	Absolutely.
10422815	10428577	On Live 365, that convention actually now has a radio channel on Live 365.
10430659	10435123	I will post a link on the forum on the chat room.
10435163	10435663	Is that okay?
10435723	10436283	That's fine.
10436303	10436984	That's absolutely fine.
10437024	10439106	I'm all for supporting other Live 365 stations.
10439166	10440146	Just don't forget about us.
10440306	10440927	That's all I ask.
10441788	10442708	Oh, trust me, I won't.
10442928	10445270	Like I said, if you like anime and stuff, check it out.
10445390	10445811	Sounds good.
10445831	10446431	Check it out then.
10446951	10455878	I think internet radio is where it's at, so definitely listen to internet radio stations including us and Anime Mid-Atlantic and whatever tickles your fancy.
10457159	10457399	Alright.
10457419	10458200	Y'all guys have a good night.
10458240	10458800	Alright, you too.
10459261	10459661	Have a good one.
10460976	10465439	Just in case anyone out there is playing WarioWare Twisted, you want to know what it sounds like at level 150?
10466319	10473503	That's lovely, thank you.
10473523	10474904	I'm going to come over there and shake that.
10475864	10481347	I'm playing the Do Not Move one and it's so easy to win because you just set it down and...
10481638	10482279	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10500390	10502832	That was the whole concept, so to speak, I guess.
10504973	10512299	I got to like 350, and my fingers were practically starting to bleed because I just was whacking that button so much.
10512479	10512859	The button!
10512979	10513360	The button!
10516682	10518363	Let's go to some Ask Orange Lounge.
10518383	10519364	We've only got a few questions.
10519384	10519724	That's all right.
10519744	10520565	We don't have a lot of show left.
10521505	10524388	Whoa, that's not the right theme music.
10524629	10528593	That's the Ask... That's Wedding Chat.
10528693	10531376	That's the Ask Satan portion of the show.
10532537	10533398	My bad, you guys.
10535160	10535861	Sorry about that.
10537863	10539164	Marriage Talk with Count Dracula.
10542901	10545864	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid questions.
10546304	10549527	What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
10550028	10556975	It's a good thing it's just DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki, and not Satan, or else the theme music would sound something like this.
10565183	10566124	Let's get to the questions.
10567535	10576060	Illusion wants to know, in your guys' opinions, is Jem truly, truly, truly outrageous?
10578381	10580282	Truly, truly, truly outrageous.
10580402	10581262	Well, you know what?
10581322	10583103	And the Misfits are bitter.
10583143	10583984	They're gonna get her.
10584624	10587406	The Misfits, their songs are better, and they're gonna get her.
10590267	10591508	The Misfits were better people.
10594391	10603675	Misty wants to know, does it still count as a hentai room if it was only running from 2-7am on Saturday and Sunday when most of the little kitties are asleep?
10605396	10606857	It turns hentai and then changes back.
10608937	10610058	I think it works for me.
10617881	10619082	Hentai is hentai, people.
10620502	10621603	That's the important thing to remember.
10623663	10626747	Doobs wants to know, oh, I'm sorry, that was his FU.
10627087	10630031	Why does everyone hate Pump It Up slash In The Groove 2?
10631152	10633535	I don't really think it's that bad of an idea.
10633695	10636398	I'd like to play Pump It Up and In The Groove at the same time.
10636919	10641484	Okay, let me clarify something for you, though, because I think this is going to be a common misconception.
10642481	10643342	With Pump It Up!
10643362	10646925	In the Groove 2, you will not be able to play both games at the same time.
10647326	10652391	Think of it as a spin-off series, that basically In the Groove is being absorbed into the Pump It Up!
10652431	10652711	series.
10652991	10662680	This does not mean that In the Groove will suddenly have five arrows or whatever, and I don't know if you were misinterpreting this, but I'm saying this in general for anybody who is thinking this way, just in general.
10664262	10667505	It's not suddenly going to mean that In the Groove turns into a five-arrow dancing game.
10667904	10668484	The Ocho The Ocho
10698604	10703726	God, that is... Yeah, it's just about their, you know, partnership with Animero.
10704106	10706507	And they're actually going to get it in a good cabinet.
10706747	10714310	And to answer the other part of the question, why does everyone hate Pump It Up in the Group 2, I will defer that to Loki, because he is the one that is most full of spite when it comes to those games.
10714430	10714590	Loki.
10715328	10716009	It sucks.
10716049	10717109	The first game sucked.
10717129	10718830	The second one's going to suck as well.
10719130	10721252	What more do I need to ask?
10721692	10726355	I'm going to be a little hopeful for the second one just because I really like the Pump It Up cabinets a whole bunch.
10726575	10733459	Okay, we'll check out the brand new cabinets with their brand spanking new huge monitor.
10733499	10735781	They'll be like, wow, ugly graphics, put bigger.
10735801	10736261	Wait a minute.
10736401	10739483	It sucks is the blandest description I've ever heard, though.
10739523	10740404	Why does it suck?
10741104	10741764	Why does it suck?
10741805	10742585	The graphics suck.
10742864	10744185	Loki, there's 12 and 13 footers in it.
10744205	10747907	Isn't that what the future of dance gaming is all about?
10772594	10773614	Oh yeah, try that on a softpad.
10774174	10774654	Yeah, yeah.
10774875	10775395	I was just curious.
10775555	10780076	Yeah, when you can't do like four footers on a softpad, yeah, 13 feet, that's gonna rock.
10780216	10782236	Okay, yeah, well, that's where it's at.
10782856	10783297	I'm sorry.
10783317	10783937	Alright.
10786517	10795119	I, I, I'm still, I say, in the groove, it's not as good as the fanboys and girls say it is, but it's not as bad as Loki says it is either.
10796120	10797240	Or the haters say.
10797320	10799380	It's, it's just, it's, it's there.
10799660	10800581	It's another dance game.
10800721	10801501	It's, it's fine.
10801741	10802201	Whatever, it's,
10802726	10805847	For me, it is kind of a holdover until new DDR, honestly.
10806167	10808228	Which I hope will happen in the arcade someday.
10809808	10810769	But I'm not going to hold my breath.
10810789	10813509	I hope.
10814029	10815550	I hope those kinds of rumors are true.
10815590	10816290	I really hope so.
10817931	10819731	Anyway, that's the end of the show.
10819811	10824693	It's time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts, starting with Sigurd, Miklatov, Shane, whatever the hell your name is.
10826693	10829314	Taco Bell has a new food item that's really good.
10831855	10832135	Loki.
10833823	10845746	I don't eat at Taco Bell because, you know, it looks like runny poop and it gives you runny poop, so the end.
10846667	10849107	My final thought is I want a Power Max.
10849147	10850008	Somebody give me $1,600.
10850468	10852128	And Loki, don't you open your mouth.
10852188	10854029	I don't want to get into this discussion with you.
10856326	10856986	What exactly?
10857546	10859287	What power would that have?
10859947	10861828	The power to crash.
10862128	10863608	The power to run nothing.
10863928	10865469	The power to play no game.
10866549	10868770	I actually want a G5.
10870070	10871070	But I'm into graphic art.
10871250	10876392	I'm waiting for Loki to say something about, you know, Macintoshes are in the groove of the computer market or something.
10878166	10886032	I am actually thinking of saving up for a G5 tower, just because since my major is mostly graphic based.
10886093	10888755	Look people, I want one because they're pretty, alright?
10888795	10889175	That's it.
10889595	10892558	I want one, I have a legitimate reason for wanting one.
10892918	10894619	You want one for aesthetic value?
10894780	10897502	No, I have real value for them.
10897822	10903827	I like the idea that they do the sound, I want things like GarageBand and those types of programs.
10904087	10904968	I think they could enhance our show.
10907329	10909270	I just want Photoshop to be able to run decently.
10910230	10914532	And honestly, my work comes out a lot better using the G5 at school than using my PC.
10916133	10916433	All right.
10917753	10918874	DarkSakura, your final thought.
10919114	10920194	Reject false icons.
10921235	10922335	Set Britney Spears on fire.
10922995	10927637	And the final word of the show, one word to sum everything up and let us know where we stand.
10927657	10929018	I gave it to you last week, didn't I, Seeker?
10930620	10931080	Alright, fine.
10931101	10932262	You can have tonight's final word.
10932322	10933222	See you guys next week.
10933262	10934383	Thanks for listening, you guys.
10934684	10937987	And the final word of the show is... Hungry.
