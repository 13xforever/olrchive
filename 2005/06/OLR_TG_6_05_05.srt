00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,660
How's their new album doing?

Pretty well?

22
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,660
Very well, very well.

23
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,700
I went to Dimple, it's number three for their bestsellers.

24
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,700
Good deal.

25
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,660
And I think it was number three on the US charts.

26
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,660
Cool.

27
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,660
For Billboard.

28
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,660
Good stuff, good stuff.

29
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,020
And I like that they have dance-y songs now because I like dare.

30
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,260
Anyway, we'll talk about music some other time because tonight we've got to talk about

31
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,260
games.

32
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,140
First off though, I want to give a big thank you to one of the podcast directors out there.

And we really appreciate all your guys' support.

42
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:15,140
The ferret is so happy that he had a seizure, seriously.

43
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,140
Great. Good to know.

44
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,140
All right.

45
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,140
Let's start off with a little bit of how is your gaming week,

46
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,820
gaming week the type of stuff you've been playing this week

47
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,820
we'll start off with loki tonight loki what kind of games you've been playing this week

48
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:29,180
i played not too much in the realm of games i played a little bit of ren goku

49
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,920
just

50
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,300
you know killing more stuff on the same level getting more experienced

51
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:39,740
beat this stupid game because it's just boring it's one of those ones where you're

52
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,300
so far into it now you just have to beat the damn thing right

53
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,920
uh... not really but like it's just not that great it just doesn't get much

54
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,740
harder. I don't know, but the first generation of PSP games just kind of blew. I don't know

55
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,740
why.

56
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Luminous. Hello.

57
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:04,520
Most of the first generation PSP games blew. Granted, there are some good ones, but there's

58
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,120
really not too much out there. Smart Bomb, for example, sucked. However, my boss gave

59
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,840
me a clean copy of it, so I was able to take it back for free, and I still have Smart Bomb.

60
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,520
So I got all my money back and I got the game for free basically.

61
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,520
So it's nice.

62
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,240
But now I have $90 in credit to GameStop and I have nothing to buy there.

63
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,240
$90?

64
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,240
Yep.

65
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,240
Dang.

66
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:30,080
And then also I played a little bit of The Simpsons arcade game on my MAME cabinet because

67
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,800
I had to fire that up to show Nellie's parents what that was.

68
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
So that was kind of neat.

69
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,340
But now I realize I have to go and fix my MAME cabinet because during the process of

70
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,800
moving it to the new apartment, wires came loose, so I got to rewire some stuff.

71
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,800
So that sucks.

72
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
Yikes.

73
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Yeah.

74
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,800
But it's nice to hear you're actually using that cabinet after all the effort you put

75
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,800
in the building.

76
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,360
I use it mainly now just watching movies on my other PC.

77
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,000
We were watching the Star Wars movies that I have borrowed from the internet.

78
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's a main cabinet.

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You don't watch movies on it.

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You play games.

81
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Old school games.

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It has a TV in there.

83
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We watch TV on it.

84
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,720
But yeah, we do play games on it, and it was fun.

85
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,520
got a kick out of the Simpsons game but you know after a while I just had to turn it off.

86
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,960
But um, a lot of fun.

87
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,360
Alright, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

88
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,880
I played lots and lots of PSO.

89
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,880
Blue Burst, correct?

90
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,880
Yes, Blue Burst.

91
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,440
I played some Silent Hill 3 and then turned it off because I was kind of bored and I watched

92
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,440
Dan beat Fire Emblem.

93
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,440
Which Fire Emblem?

94
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,440
The new game?

95
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,440
The Sacred Stones.

96
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,440
Oh okay, cool.

97
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,440
Yeah.

98
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,440
The one that just came out, the GameCube one, it's not out yet.

99
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,440
Ah, alright.

100
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,120
but, um, but yeah, I got to see the end of, uh, Fire Emblem. That's, like, all he plays

101
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,200
now is, well, let's put in the Game Boy Advance, play and play, uh, Fire Emblem.

102
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,520
You know, Fire Emblem was one of those games that was popular in Japan for a long time,

103
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,040
but it took a long time to come over here, and now it's-

104
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,480
Well, you know what they're playing today? Hmm?

105
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,140
Busted out the Super Nintendo and popped in the Super Famicom card of Fire Emblem 3.

106
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,520
I saw that when I went over there. I saw that one of your friends was playing, like, a Japanese

107
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,800
game on the Super Nintendo, this is the kind of stuff I only see happen at your house.

108
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,760
Yeah, and of course like upside down next to it was the PS2 and the Dreamcast tucked

109
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,600
into the corner and the Xbox dancing a jig.

110
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Show off.

111
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,360
And I saw Sega Fantasy 5.

112
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,360
What's that?

113
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,640
Well, you know what Sega Fantasy 6 was, right?

114
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,420
It was about the bunch of different gaming systems going up to kick the Xbox's ass Final

115
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,800
Fantasy 6 style.

116
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,800
But I watched Sega Fantasy 5 which was frustrating because the text would move just

117
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:35,040
fast enough that I would catch words and bits and pieces of Kana and not be able to read the whole thing so I was like

118
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,920
That's cool, I didn't know I didn't know that existed that's kind of funny

119
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,920
Sega fanboys and fangirls are pretty rabid

120
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:49,880
I'll see about posting link on the orange lounge radio comm life journal forum very nice nice plug

121
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,760
Alright, my gaming week, you know, there's not a whole lot of new stuff out there that

122
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,720
I really wanted to check out.

123
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,000
I wanted to buy a new DS game this week, but really, all that's out right now, I think

124
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,920
the only game that came out was Madagascar, which is a game I might be excited about if

125
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,000
I was seven years old, but I'm not, so I could care less.

126
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Then, Polarium.

127
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I played another game, actually.

128
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Okay, what's that?

129
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Lots and lots of the Pac-Pix demo at GameStop.

130
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Alright.

131
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,840
I thought Meteos was coming out.

132
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,040
Meteos is out June 27th.

133
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,960
It's the day after my birthday and I couldn't be more happier that the DS is getting that.

134
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,440
Sigma Star Saga is coming out, Game Boy Advance, I think, or, yeah, I think that's Game Boy

135
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,440
Advance.

136
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,680
That one's actually supposed to be pretty interesting because it's, imagine, you know,

137
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,720
your typical RPG, but instead of the random battles, it's random side-scroller shooters.

138
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,520
Oh, that's cool.

139
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,520
Huh.

140
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,520
Interesting.

141
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,880
Well, so since I didn't really get anything new, I went back to my collection and I said,

142
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,120
well, what are some games I really didn't play enough of?

143
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,320
So I'm checking out Mario DS, Mario 64 DS, because I really didn't get that far into

144
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,320
it.

145
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,920
I think I got about 30 stars, and then I said, screw it, I got more games to play.

146
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,540
But I really want more minigames right now, because surprisingly enough, the minigames

147
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,180
to me were the best part of Mario DS.

148
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:06,640
And also, I don't know if it's just me, but Mario 64, and I'm going to get a lot of crap

149
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,960
and hate letters for this, I think Mario 64 is one of the most overrated games ever, because

150
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,400
I see a lot of lists out there.

151
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,880
You know how every website out there has got to have a top 100 list.

152
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,760
And Super Mario 64 is always in the top 3 of the greatest platformers or the greatest

153
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,760
games even.

154
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:30,940
You know, I have to disagree with you, but I have special memories of Mario 64, because

155
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,800
Dan and I would play Mario 64 together and bond over it.

156
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,160
Well yeah, see, you got special stuff there.

157
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,800
Now add one single word in there, then it makes all the sense in the world.

158
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,480
Mario Kart 64, that was the game.

159
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,480
That was the game.

160
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,480
That game rocks.

161
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,840
Mario 64 for me was nothing but a bunch of like frustrating cameras and I don't know,

162
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,480
I mean it was, it was darn innovative at the time, yeah I gotta give it that, but I just,

163
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:01,200
I don't know if I would place it so near the top in the great, you know, list of video

164
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,960
game greats, because there's other Mario games I could think of that were better than Mario

165
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,960
64.

166
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,400
And what I also don't get, when people place Mario Sunshine at the bottom, say it was a

167
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,400
horrible, horrible game.

168
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,880
Mario Sunshine was cool!

169
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,560
But yeah, Mario Sunshine to me was not that bad.

170
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,320
I thought it was... It was like Mario 64 with water.

171
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,560
I hate to say it was better than Mario 64, but I was

172
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,200
entertained longer by Mario Sunshine than I was in Mario. And honestly, folks, if you have a

173
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,120
GameCube,

174
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,920
you should go out and buy it. It's only $19.99, probably less now.

175
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:37,400
And really, as far as new cube games coming out, there isn't a whole lot.

176
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,640
so hello Twilight Princess that's gonna be the one that well

177
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,680
there isn't a whole lot coming out period okay we're kind of in a slow period anyway

178
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,740
honestly there's like

179
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,860
Geist and Killer7 and that's about it

180
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,040
well I'm glad you bring that up because we're gonna get into tonight's news and

181
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,300
starting off with GameCube games getting delayed

182
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,400
and guess what two games got delayed Geist and Killer7

183
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,960
Killer7 is now in July now and Geist is also in July

184
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:10,160
actually guys say things in August now killer 7 is going to be out July 7

185
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,540

186
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,860
and then guys does also push back as well

187
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,420
I'm August is going to be the release date for guys

188
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:24,300
I keep up on that stuff yeah well I know the value for your work stuff but

189
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:28,780
you have to make it sound exciting for a podcast is exciting you do that for me

190
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:33,140
it is exciting because he there's not them a good GameCube games come out

191
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:37,180
A little bit of PSP news, Loki, you'll love this one.

192
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,440
PSP is getting some bonafide

193
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,740
actual porn. I read about that, that's awesome.

194
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,780
Not somebody putting the porn on their memory sticks as most PSP users probably

195
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,700
did the first day they got it. UMD porn.

196
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,180
Actual UMD porn coming out in Japan and the

197
00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:00,180
company that's putting this out is Glaze, G-L-A-Y apostrophe Z,

198
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:06,820
Starting off July 8th, the titles will be anywhere between 1,995 yen

199
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,940
and just under 4,000 yen. That's about 18 to 37 dollars

200
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,820
US. Now I can't... I will

201
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,780
horribly butcher some of these names if I try to pronounce them. However,

202
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:21,780
I like some of this. On July 22nd, Bi-body

203
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:26,380
Aeroterrorist Noah. Aeroterrorist, what is that?

204
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:31,340
I don't know. And let's see. HMP Countdown 2005.

205
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,740
HMP... Like Humping? I don't know. HMP... HUMP COUNTDOWN!

206
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,460
July 8th. Kanishiro Anna.

207
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:43,140
Koiku Soap Jew. I just like that because it has the word soap in it. So I don't know.

208
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,260
Maybe it's like Bubble Bath Babes, the porn. I don't know.

209
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,260
I can't. Do you really want to read this though?

210
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,500
It doesn't matter. It's all good though. But hey,

211
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,780
that's pretty cool. They should make Jew on the game. But too bad though,

212
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,700
it's going to be price censored because they censored it porn.

213
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,660
Porn in Japan is pixelated. That sucks. Mosaic porn is no fun.

214
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:10,300
Interesting. What do you think? Is this something that's going to catch on?

215
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,420
Is this something we're going to see in the US? You know, honestly,

216
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,820
probably. You know who I actually see probably

217
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,860
putting stuff out for it and be like Playboy? Something like that.

218
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,020
We did have a story a couple months ago about Playboy.com.

219
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:28,180
They're ibod crap and honestly you might see some of that stuff.

220
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:35,420
I think even better is downloadable content because honestly I couldn't see buying.

221
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,340
I just can't see a situation where this would come in handy.

222
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,340
Come in handy.

223
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,340
Get it?

224
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,340
Money.

225
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,340
Yeah, whatever.

226
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:48,500
I just don't see it being something I'd spend money on.

227
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,060
Again, I don't see myself spending money on UMDs, and here's a kind of story that ties

228
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,060
in there.

229
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:59,880
I'm not sure if we can cover it, but actually we're talking about the first two UMDs actually

230
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:08,420
hit 100,000 in sales, 100,000 units sold, and the first two would be House of Flying

231
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,320
Daggers and Resident Evil Apocalypse.

232
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,500
It took them only two months to reach 100,000, whereas the first DVD to reach 100,000, which

233
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:24,980
which was, I believe, Air Force One to reach 100,000. It took nine months. That's how fast

234
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:25,980
this stuff is selling.

235
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:29,220
I would have never guessed UMD, and I know I've said it on this show, and boy did I get

236
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,300
proven wrong. I did not think UMDs would take off.

237
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:42,100
They're selling. It's crazy. UMDs to me are like DVHS. It seems like such a useless format,

238
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,620
but people are buying this stuff because honestly this is like a replacement for a portable

239
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:52,460
DVD player. You know what it reminds me of? When did DVD players really take off when

240
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:56,580
PlayStation 2 came out? So maybe it's kind of similar where people don't want to buy

241
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:02,500
portable DVD players but they'll buy a PSP which is like a portable DVD player. I don't

242
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,220
know. I can't explain it. Hey, whatever. Yeah, that's cool. Whatever makes you happy. Dark

243
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,900
Sakura, you had a comment? Porn on the PSP? It's going to be really big in Japan. Here

244
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,460
it's not going to fly.

245
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,460
I don't think so.

246
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:17,660
Yeah, I don't think they're going to do it because age demographic, it's not going to

247
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,660
happen.

248
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,660
We'll see.

249
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,660
Also, a PSP news.

250
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:26,340
Now, going along with PSP news in Japan, they're saying it's slumping over in Tokyo, actually,

251
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,340
in Japan.

252
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:31,660
A new story coming out of Tokyo saying that the sales of the PSP are slumping.

253
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:39,240
From the week of May 23rd to 29th, only four PSP games were in the complete top 50, none

254
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:45,920
of them cracking the top 20, whereas you look on the other half of it, six Nintendo DS titles

255
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:52,120
in the top 20, Nintendogs doing huge business over in Japan, and I predict it's going to

256
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,760
do very well over here as well.

257
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,720
Nintendogs is so cute!

258
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,440
It's my favorite thing over at E3.

259
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,600
I love the puppies.

260
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,320
I played Frisbee with the puppies.

261
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,520
Is this a sign of things to come?

262
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,200
Is the DS going to outdo the PSP here in America?

263
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:18,200
It's America. We want it bigger, faster. It needs to do more shit. It needs Sony because the world sucks the cock of Sony.

264
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:29,200
There was honestly a big launch of games from the beginning. They had about 20 or so games out for this. Now it's dead as far as what's coming out.

265
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:36,200
That's what's happening. There's only a couple games. People are tired of the old games and now they're waiting for more stuff. It's in DS syndrome now.

266
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,720
Exactly what I was thinking is PSP is now suffering the same thing DS is I would say

267
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,160
to most extent still suffering through.

268
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,640
Both systems to me are at a dead still.

269
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:50,600
We don't have any really great games out on the horizon.

270
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,960
Maybe Meteos on the DS of course coming later this month.

271
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,160
That's by the res guy.

272
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:02,360
Looking at the PSP calendar, Batman Begins is coming out in June, Midnight Club 3 Dub

273
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,360
Edition now that could be very cool also coming out in June.

274
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,160
the only game slated for July, according to the calendar I have here, Star Wars Episode

275
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,160
3. So there's really not a whole lot of stuff coming out this summer.

276
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,880
Not necessarily. There's Armored Core is going to be coming out, Armored Core Formula

277
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:23,360
Prime, and also Dead to Rights will be coming out for the PSP as well in July or June, I

278
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,640
believe. Those are going to be coming out, and I haven't heard anything about Star Wars

279
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:34,160
yet and the Revenge of the Sith. I think that I got pushed back, and same with Midnight

280
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,880
Club 3 I think. DS on the other hand, DS is starting to pick up a

281
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,440
little steam here now they've been slumping through the past few months they're

282
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,640
starting to pick up a little steam. You've got GoldenEye,

283
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:48,600
Kirby Canvas Curse, Bomberman, Meteos, Tom Clancy Splinter Cell all this month.

284
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,320
Nanostray is going to be awesome. And Nanostray in July along with Spyro

285
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,360
Shadow Legacy also coming out in July.

286
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,960
So you can kind of see that it's starting to pick up a little bit of steam

287
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,200
whereas the PSP is in that

288
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,400
kind of, at least in my opinion, now everybody's got everything but

289
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,540
for me and the games I'm into. PSP's slumping right now

290
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:10,000
whereas DS is finally starting to pick up steam. Yeah, but the PSP is going to be

291
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,160
getting a lot of play in my house for me when

292
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,460
Papakaros comes out. Aren't you getting sick of this crap though where games

293
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,120
or the launches put all their games out

294
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,280
for the launch titles and then it's dead for like four months?

295
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,520
I'm honestly kind of looking forward to seeing Sony get screwed over for their arrogance.

296
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,780
That right there though, see that right there, that's what's gonna make the revolution rock.

297
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:34,260
If the next-gen systems pull the same crap,

298
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:38,700
I'm not usually one for resting on your laurels, but Nintendo

299
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:42,700
has always had, even though they haven't been at the top

300
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,700
of everything, they've had the staying power, they are stable.

301
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,300
See, again, this backs up what I said last week when I said I don't think that it's

302
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,620
such a bad thing that Revolution wasn't shown at E3 because I think they're

303
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,740
taking their sweetest time so that they can.

304
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,540
yeah they can they're doing it because they can because they know

305
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,620
they have been a trusted name for how long

306
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,720
I with Sony there in the beginning no

307
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,920
Sony was the bitch of Nintendo for a while and

308
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,800
they did the sound processor for the Super Nintendo and we're working on the

309
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,420
you're gonna get angry emails on that one

310
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:18,460
think think imagine with me here

311
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:21,460
just for a second here's where Nintendo is going to be revealed

312
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,900
Dark soccer is not finished I'm still had a rant to go

313
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,780
But Nintendo has been there since the late eighties.

314
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:32,240
There has always been a Nintendo system

315
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,620
since I would say right after

316
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,820
the uh, now I think the Master System was out first.

317
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:42,820
I was gonna say, I was just about to ask you though, couldn't you say the same thing about Sega? They were there in the beginning too, look at what happened to them.

318
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,620
Yeah, but Sega,

319
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:48,300
Sega actually started off doing third-party publishing because I've got

320
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,380
some Sega games on my Colecovision

321
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,420
and then they went, you know, they were pretty strong but I think that they sort of shot

322
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:59,580
themselves in the foot with the Dreamcast by it was there early it was

323
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:05,780
out but they needed to market it a little differently I think and then they

324
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,940
actually really got fucked over by the fact that Sony said hey we're gonna jump

325
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,620
in the market too that is what screwed over the Dreamcast it's a matter of

326
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:17,500
timing hmm Loki anyways I was gonna say imagine if you will because this is why

327
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,820
the revolution is gonna rock first off when it comes out it's gonna have launch

328
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,840
games that'd be cool but the thing is there will be a dead period of games well

329
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,240
one of the things that's going to be coming out is some of those downloads

330
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,440
remember you can download everything from you know Donkey Kong up to Mario

331
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:35,000
Sunshine basically for some of those are gonna be free that's gonna be cool but

332
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,920
here's the other thing that I think they're going to do download play to

333
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,640
your DS all those games you're downloading to your your revolution

334
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,880
you're gonna build down them to your DS put in sleep mode and take it with you

335
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,320
interesting thought interesting thought I like that idea well we'll see what

336
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,960
happens let's move on though anyway we got a lot of news to get through tonight

337
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:57,840
on dirge of cerebrus or cerebrus cerebrus cerebrus my horrible

338
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:07,960
pronunciation skills coming out or as we call it Vincent may cry website is up

339
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,040
and you get new downloads and you get more information on the story and

340
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,700
everything going on you can check that out and it's square dash enix dot co dot

341
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:33,820
You have no idea how big my Vincent fangirlism has been.

342
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:43,380
I had a directory of something like 3,000 doujinshi official art fan art pictures of

343
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,780
Vincent and I lost the one when my hard drive crashed.

344
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:50,280
Wow. You know what's funny? I was a scary fangirl. When I played through Final Fantasy 7 the

345
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:50,980
first time

346
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:55,540
I never got Vincent. You didn't know the right questions to ask. I guess so.

347
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,660
Wasn't that Yuffie? Vincent's the one where you open the safe.

348
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,820
Vincent, you have to talk to him a certain way. That's right.

349
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:05,460
And he wasn't in the safe, he was in a coffin. Sexy!

350
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,740
Anyway, let's move on.

351
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,340
Retailer news. Very interesting some of the things retailers are doing this week.

352
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:16,140
GameStop is already taking pre-orders for Halo 3

353
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:20,740
which, that doesn't surprise me considering every time I buy something

354
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,900
at GameStop or really any store these days

355
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:27,900
they always want me to pre-order something. Would you like to pre-order?

356
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,940
I understand but it's just... You know the thing is though, is it by getting your pre-order in early

357
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,460
you're guaranteed for shipment?

358
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:39,220
I personally don't do it because I'm a very spontaneous person and I like to

359
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,820
buy games, just walk in and I feel like buying this day.

360
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,060
I'm not a big pre-order person, I'm really not, and I have never

361
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:49,260
been denied a game I want by its out-of-stock or anything.

362
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,900
I always know how to find it. But whatever, pre-ordering's your thing.

363
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:57,260
Honestly, you can probably go to the GameStop now and pre-order the PS4,

364
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:00,180
you know, something like that. They'll take pre-orders for anything.

365
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:04,100
This was the other interesting thing, though. Walmart listed on its website this week

366
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:08,540
Katamari Damacy for the PSP, and the world let out a collective

367
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:12,420
Huh? Because we all thought Katamari Damacy was supposed to be on the DS.

368
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,500
So what do you think? Is there any merit to this? I go,

369
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,740
no, this is BS. I think it's just a mistake. Just like,

370
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:21,860
what was it, they had marijuana.

371
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:26,580
Target.com was selling marijuana at one point, which was some Web Kids

372
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,700
joke. I think, I don't think you can really trust

373
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:35,420
Walmart.com as your source for gaming. Honestly, I would have heard about it

374
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,420
already because,

375
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:57,420
would have been announced, I would have had to put it on my list. But anyways, the thing is, as far as games come, I'm totally lost now, but I'm not surprised that Halo 3, they've got pre-orders for it, but I wouldn't take that as, like, God, as it's coming out right away. I mean, it'll probably be a launch game or something pretty close.

376
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:02,420
Halo 3 is not going to be a launch game, it's going to come out when the PS3 is put out.

377
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:07,420
It's stupid. Honestly, I'm not going to get this game system because Halo 3 is coming out.

378
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:11,420
People that have the Xbox buy Halo 3. It doesn't matter. We'll buy both.

379
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:21,420
I will buy the Xbox 360 when Halo 3 is out because there's a better chance that the Xbox 360 might get its first price cut before then in order to entice sales of it.

380
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,420
It's not going to matter at my house. We get them all.

381
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:28,420
I know. Speaking of which, since we're talking about stuff in vendors and all that wonderful stuff.

382
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:34,940
wonderful stuff. PSP, there's rumors about it actually getting a price cut to $200, and

383
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:39,460
the reason why they are saying that this is going to happen, and one, they've heard it

384
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:43,540
from like a friend who heard it from somebody, you know, that type of thing. Well, there's

385
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:49,700
that. And then there's also the fact that apparently, I guess, Best Buy is listing now

386
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:59,100
on their website, Best Buy and EB Games are now stocking the official stuff like the Sony

387
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:05,260
headphones, the little soft case, the 32 meg memory stick card, and the battery chargers.

388
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:10,220
They're all sale individually, which this stuff's usually bundled with it.

389
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:14,980
So if there's going to be a non-bundle, then it's going to drop in price.

390
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:18,500
Well, logically, but okay, that's all good I guess.

391
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,720
at the same time it doesn't make much sense because you have to have a

392
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,300
memory stick with the PSP so you're going to end up buying that separately.

393
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,340
You have to have some type of charger so you're going to end up buying that.

394
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:31,340
Honestly, if I think what's going to happen though, the charger, I could see

395
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,420
maybe replacement memory stick as a replacement.

396
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:36,700
I think if they were going to do one, it would be just

397
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,860
system, memory stick, charger.

398
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:43,900
We'll see what happens. Alright, we here at Orange Launch Radio, we're not just

399
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,700
here to bring you the latest and greatest in video game news, but we're

400
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,980
here to better your life.

401
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:51,980
because if we just sat around and played video games all day long

402
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:55,500
we would have no time to go out drinking so

403
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,780
one way we're gonna better your life here is to have the one and only Dark

404
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,140
Sakura give you her

405
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:05,380
advice column. Dark Sakura what do you have to tell the kids about tonight?

406
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:10,020
Today's bit of advice is how to jump from a bridge or cliff into a river

407
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,340
so that when people tell you to take a flying leap you'll know what to do.

408
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:17,060
Now kids don't really try this at home

409
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:39,500
1. Jump feet first. 2. Keep your body entirely vertical. 3. Squeeze your feet together. 4.

410
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:44,300
Enter the water feet first, but clench your buttocks together. If you do not, water may

411
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:54,260
rush in and cause severe internal damage. 5. Protect your crotch area by covering it

412
00:24:54,260 --> 00:25:02,500
with your hands. 6. Immediately after you hit the water, spread

413
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,300
your arms and legs wide. Move them back and forth to generate resistance, which will slow

414
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:14,140
your plunge to the bottom but my uh honest uh final piece of advice in this

415
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:19,340
drown also avoid rocks that's like a major one right there

416
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:23,260
of if you see rocks poking out of the water might not be a good idea to jump

417
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,740
towards it

418
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:30,460
please don't do that at home you're not vin diesel you don't need to be jumping

419
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:34,700
off the bridge what cliff diving not well he used to

420
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,580
I'll jump off the rainbow bridge.

421
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,100
Wow.

422
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,220
Wowee wow.

423
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,940
Did he remember to tighten his buttocks when he jumped?

424
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,140
I'll have to ask him.

425
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,140
Please ask him.

426
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:49,260
Moving on, gaming companies.

427
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,140
I know that most of you guys are located in Silicon Valley,

428
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,180
although the rest of you guys, some

429
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,860
are located elsewhere in the nation, New York, wherever.

430
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:02,340
Louisiana is trying to get you to move your company over

431
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,180
there.

432
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:08,500
recently passed Louisiana Bill 341. It grants game developers generous tax

433
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,100
credits

434
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,380
if they relocate to Louisiana. It was

435
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,820
unanimously passed by the Senate. It gives a 10 percent

436
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:19,300
state tax income credit to studios that spend

437
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,940
anywhere between three hundred thousand dollars and eight million

438
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:27,420
by setting up shop in Louisiana and then remaining there for one year.

439
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,580
Do you see game companies rushing to Louisiana?

440
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,580
It could happen if they can live through the freaking humidity.

441
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:36,580
The first thing I was going to comment on too is that, you know...

442
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,580
I have been there.

443
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,580
Here's one thing that Louisiana, and with all due respect to our listeners in Louisiana,

444
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,580
I love you guys for tuning in, but let's think about it.

445
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,580
They probably don't have to blow on Nintendo cartridges down there

446
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,580
to get them to work anymore because it's so damn human.

447
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,580
No, you just have to deal with them resting.

448
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,580
No, no, no, you laugh.

449
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,580
No, I laugh because it's true.

450
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,580
But it happened.

451
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:01,740
you have to clean your contacts with alcohol

452
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:06,060
for our buddies over in the UK Dark Sakura's got your back what's going on

453
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,500
for the British folk

454
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,220
this is about the Gizmondo

455
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:13,780
the Gizmondo is put out by a UK company

456
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:17,980
actually looking over their stats it's a pretty pretty impressive little system

457
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,780
I got to play it, I got to play Johnny whatever

458
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:23,420
sort of like a game where you wail hard on your guitar and then you have a little

459
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,100
karaoke mode that plays sort of

460
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:29,940
like Guitar Freaks meets Karaoke Revolution

461
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:34,620
but basically it's going to be powered by Windows CE

462
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,860
it has a 2.8 inch TFT color screen

463
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,740
it actually supports MPEG4 movie

464
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:44,620
multimedia messaging, digital camera,

465
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:47,620
GPRS network

466
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:51,060
basically it's looking like it's trying to really compete with the PSP

467
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:54,580
just to run over some of the features 400 megahertz

468
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:58,500
ARM 9 processor, 64-bit graphics processor

469
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:04,580
8-way D-pad, left and right triggers, all these like bajillion buttons on it

470
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:08,680
integrated digital camera, 3D game engine

471
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:12,300
But Dark Sakura, can you play pornography on it?

472
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:17,500
Eventually. MPEG-4 video, come on. It has Windows Media Player 9 on it

473
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:22,220
Oh, there you go. Polyphonic ringtones, apparently it's also gonna

474
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:25,620
try to kick Nokia back under the grave

475
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:29,500
even if they aren't already there sorry but I mean come on

476
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,980
yeah this is like the nail in the coffin games coming out conflict vietnam

477
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,860

478
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:38,020

479
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:41,100

480
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,940
Rayman well if they relocate to

481
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,500
you know Louisiana then that won't be a problem

482
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:55,320
Also, that game Johnny Whatever, which we have pictures of on OrangeLoudRadio.com on

483
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,320
my E3 gallery.

484
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,320
Yes.

485
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,700
Any idea of her release date for our British friends?

486
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:04,940
It actually is scheduled to be hitting the U.S. August 11th, 2005.

487
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,900
Which means what, they get it three months later as typical?

488
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,900
I have no idea.

489
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,900
Sorry.

490
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,900
Sorry.

491
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,900
You guys know I'm telling the truth.

492
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,900
Sorry.

493
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,120
I'm having a feeling it's likely going to be coming out there around the same time.

494
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,100
It's not giving a difference in the dates.

495
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,100
That would be good.

496
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:21,340
If it's a portable system, they don't exactly have to redo the specs, because that's usually

497
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:27,340
why games take so long, because they have to go from NTSC to PAL, and all that. That's

498
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:30,100
usually why games get delayed, but they won't have to worry about that with Gizmodo.

499
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:34,780
No, and the thing is, it's like the same reason you can play PAL discs on an NTSC on your

500
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:40,100
computer, I mean, it's the same difference. But it really is looking like it's trying

501
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:45,660
to go head-to-head with the PSP, and on top of that, it actually takes flash drive.

502
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:50,060
I actually see it as more, not so much PSP, but more N-Gage, what N-Gage really should

503
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,060
have been.

504
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,060
Kind of.

505
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,300
It looks like it's trying to bridge the fence.

506
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:57,260
I don't want to have to compare the N-Gage to anything, because nobody is deserving of

507
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,620
that kind of punishment, but, you know, compared to a doggone.

508
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:04,020
But apparently it's being put out by Tiger.

509
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,020
Yeah, good.

510
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,020
Would you?

511
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:09,980
Tiger used to put out all those little LCD games back in the day, beep, beep, beep, beep,

512
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:10,980
beep, beep.

513
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:15,180
But Tiger's been around for a while, you know, and honestly, I honestly, honestly really

514
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:20,500
think that I'm going to get a Gizmondo. After playing it at E3, and also with just the excellent

515
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,060
show they put on, it's looking like it's going to be big.

516
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:27,740
You're not going to get it just because you have every other console system known to man.

517
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,540
I am a completion whore.

518
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:32,620
I will just borrow yours, when you let me.

519
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:36,100
You know, and honestly though, it actually was pretty comfortable to play. You know how

520
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,260
some systems just feel kind of out of whack in your hand?

521
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,260
Like the Engage?

522
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,260
It felt pretty comfortable.

523
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,260
I...

524
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,260
Do you mean the taco?

525
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:46,820
Gizmondo's going to have to wait in line because I still have to pick up a PSP, but I'm interested

526
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:47,820
in Gizmondo.

527
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,740
Why don't they just call it the Magic Taco Gaming System?

528
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,300
I think it would sell better.

529
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,300
Moving on.

530
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,300
Loki, what's up?

531
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,300
Video Taco!

532
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,300
We love the taco!

533
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,300
Anyway.

534
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,380
Loki, tell us about some hackin' and crackin'.

535
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:02,140
There's some cool stuff coming out actually for the PSP that you can get.

536
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:07,560
One of them's actually this group that's a Spanish electronica group called the Overkillers,

537
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,120
And they actually have a download.

538
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,300
Their whole music album is available now for a free PSP download.

539
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,300
And that's kinda cool.

540
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:20,780
So you can get that and I would say it's probably better to go to psphackers.com and then find

541
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:23,160
the link because the website's too long.

542
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,240
But anyways, you can get it.

543
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,480
It's like a good 63.6 meg download, so check it out.

544
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,080
There's some, obviously, they're going emulator crazy on the PSP right now.

545
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,080
Actually, I've noticed.

546
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,080
The PSP.

547
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,040
I've seen a lot of gaming blogs over on 1up.com.

548
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,400
are posting pictures of their PSP emulated stuff.

549
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:47,680
I'm almost tempted to go get a 1.0 version PSP, one of the Japanese first ones, but soon

550
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:53,800
enough once that 1.5, once they crack that, it's gonna be heaven man. You're gonna have

551
00:31:53,800 --> 00:32:00,120
all the Game Boy Advance games, they actually have Neo Geo emulated on that and that's great.

552
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:07,240
So yeah, definitely, if you're lucky enough to have one, the brand new version 1.01, definitely

553
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,120
check all this stuff out. Tons of fun stuff for that.

554
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:15,960
Now if you like more gadget-y junk, they've got the PSP Shuffle, where you can actually,

555
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:22,000
this program you can download, and it'll actually put random content on your PSP, basically.

556
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,480
That sounds kind of freaky.

557
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,480
It's kind of retarded.

558
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,480
Okay.

559
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,880
You actually have to buy this?

560
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,880
Life is random!

561
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,240
Why would you have to buy this program?

562
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,240
That's retarded.

563
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,560
But anyways, you can buy it if you want to, but honestly, save your time.

564
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,000
There are consumer whores out there.

565
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,180
I mean, if you want to be random, I'm never having a problem figuring out what I can put

566
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,180
on my PSP.

567
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:44,080
If you want to be random, put a dollar in an envelope and send it to me.

568
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,040
Honestly, that would be pretty random, and then I would have money.

569
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,600
But yeah, that's some cool stuff coming out.

570
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,400
Now I know that there's been some more stuff.

571
00:32:52,400 --> 00:33:00,240
I was watching the whole DS Linux, the whole thing going on with that, and they actually

572
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,040
have some progress on that, and it looks pretty cool.

573
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:08,400
They've got on the modgods.com, and it's a site that carries a bunch of information about

574
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:20,420
DS hacking, and they actually have DS Hacker.com they actually released, but they've got a

575
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:31,180
whole thing, they're showing pictures of the new version of Linux that's running on the

576
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:39,380
DS, and it actually has a picture of the Linux penguin with the Mario hat on it, which I

577
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:42,780
thought was pretty cute.

578
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:49,860
So it's coming along pretty soon, and you can actually download a copy of it, the Dualist

579
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:56,860
DS emulator. Oh, that's an emulator for DS. Well, check that out too. But a bunch of cool

580
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:02,900
stuff. And for my final thing to leave you guys with, actually two things. Under the

581
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:06,340
Knife looks awesome, because I want to cut up people just for the hell of it.

582
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:09,740
I completely missed this game at E3 and everybody's talking about it.

583
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:12,100
Under the Knife, there's an old game called like...

584
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,100
Operation?

585
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,980
No, not Operation. Life and Death.

586
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:17,760
Oh, shit! I remember that game.

587
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:27,760
All you would do is appendix surgery, but now under the knife you can relive the wonderful

588
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,760
doctor things.

589
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,440
There's a little error thing on there which you can do, but you basically cut people open

590
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,440
and fix them.

591
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,680
It's quite interesting.

592
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:41,160
When that comes out here, which is going to be in the winter of 2005, check it out.

593
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:44,440
Then they have this really weird one, and I don't know what the hell this is.

594
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,480
It's Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney.

595
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,540
That sounds quite boring, but actually I saw a preview for that.

596
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,540
It looked kind of funny.

597
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,540
I want to play that.

598
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,540
It looked kind of funny.

599
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,540
You'd be surprised.

600
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,540
That's why I got my alley.

601
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,540
A couple other things.

602
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,780
The DS, more colors, pink and red.

603
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:03,340
So now you've got red that's going to be coming out for Jump Superstars, which I don't know

604
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,340
is another game.

605
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,340
And that's here in America?

606
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,340
No, no, no, no.

607
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,340
It's in Japan.

608
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:10,900
Yeah, I need to import the graphite one because the graphite one is all shiny black.

609
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:15,420
So yeah, those are going to be coming out and definitely check out the brand new screens

610
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:22,420
for the Linux because it'll be awesome.

611
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:50,660
that's awful. Remember Monochrome Green? How did we live? I don't know. Honestly. Oregon

612
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:54,380
Trail, that's how we made it. Alright, a couple more stories. Let's talk about what's going

613
00:35:54,380 --> 00:36:01,020
on in some MMO's worlds right now. Not technically an MMO, okay. Warcraft 3, more of a head to

614
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:11,460
head game. Blizzard closed over 53,000 battle.net accounts on Warcraft 3. Basically, they were

615
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:16,540
closed because they were hacking or cheating during a multiplayer session.

616
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:19,300
Some of them were just banned for ladder play from a month.

617
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,780
Some were permanently removed, crazy.

618
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:27,620
So man, don't mess with those battle net.

619
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:31,160
Don't mess with your games because they'll get you.

620
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:37,800
And one of the granddad, now this is as old school as MMOs get here, Ultima Online.

621
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,900
Do we know anybody that still plays Ultima Online?

622
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,900
Yes.

623
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:45,860
I don't know anybody that still plays this, but that's cool. Ultima Online is getting another

624
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:49,340
expansion. It's called Mondane's Legacy.

625
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:53,340
You know that game's been out for eight years now? Mondane or Mundane?

626
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:56,860
Mondane. I know.

627
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:00,440
You would think after eight years. August 30th is the release of this game.

628
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,860
If you want a free trial of Ultima Online, see what you might be missing,

629
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:07,540
don't make fun until you've played it. I have played it. UO.com.

630
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,860
I still know people who are freaking playing Asheron's Call.

631
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,860
Why? That's not so surprising, but Ultimate Online.

632
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:17,860
The only thing I remember from Ultimate Online, because you'd have, like,

633
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:21,860
you can buy your own house, is people would put their horses in the house so it wouldn't get stolen.

634
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,860
Yeah. It builds like a stable room.

635
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,860
No, it's just a house.

636
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,860
No, no, I've seen them. I've played Asheron's Call.

637
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:31,860
And they would just call it a stable room.

638
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:35,860
I like the trophy rooms and stuff, where you keep your portals and shit.

639
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:39,740
Miyamoto made a very interesting comment this week in a

640
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:43,460
article on CNN Money. He said

641
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:47,240
there's not a lot I want to play now. A lot of the games out there are just too

642
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:47,900
long.

643
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:51,340
Of course there are games such as Halo or Grand Theft Auto that are big and

644
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,220
expansive

645
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:55,460
but if you're not interested in spending that time with them you're not gonna

646
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,140
play.

647
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:59,500
Interesting. You think games are too long these days?

648
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:04,420
Miyamoto's got a point? There need to be more, you know, quick play fun games.

649
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:10,040
But see the thing is with Grand Theft Auto though that is a quick play fun game same with Halo 2 actually because you can

650
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,600
Go and play multiplayer games. It's fun Grand Theft Auto. You don't even have to play the game

651
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:18,420
You just run around exist in the world and it's fun. And that's the whole point. That's why I love that game

652
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,420
That's why I can take Grand Theft Auto

653
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:25,760
Not play it for like a year and come back to it and still have fun in it and just be able to pick it

654
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:31,580
Right up again or even just be able to play it for weeks at a time because it's you can find little fun things to do

655
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:37,520
it. Maybe that's the problem, the fact that there is so much you can do with it, instead

656
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:44,020
of having something just simple, to the point. But you know what, don't buy it then. I don't

657
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:48,900
buy it, I think it's kind of crap, but you know, I like my puzzle games and I like my

658
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:54,900
cute RPGs. Maybe this is a hint as to what the revolution is. After 15 minutes, the revolution

659
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,700
shuts off and tells you to go outside, Fatty.

660
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:03,620
It's one of those old Nintendo demo machines.

661
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:07,220
Nintendo has always had, though, a family-oriented point of view.

662
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:11,820
I mean, we have had the fair share of violent games, but for the most part, Nintendo has

663
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:17,460
been, you know, they have brought out things that are kid-friendly, family-safe, you know,

664
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,580
that type of thing.

665
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:21,740
Nintendo only started getting a little more violent with that stuff, though, after they

666
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:25,740
were publicly embarrassed with Mortal Kombat's sweat thing. I mean, that was the laughing

667
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,740
stock at the time.

668
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,740
Yeah.

669
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,740
Alright.

670
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:33,940
Yeah, if you put in the blood code on Mortal Kombat 2, it would change some of the fatalities.

671
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:37,980
One more opinion piece. This was something that was posted over on Slashdot, which I

672
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:45,020
think was just a repeat of something from CNET, but they were predicting on CNET that

673
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:52,120
The next generation consoles will kill off PC gaming.

674
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:56,640
The bottom line is that console manufacturers often heavily subsidize their new machines

675
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:04,880
swallowing huge losses up front in hopes that they'll make it all back selling games, which

676
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:11,160
is to say that once the 18-34 demographic starts buying $400 PS3s instead of $400 video

677
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,200
cards, developers may have no choice but to follow suit.

678
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,880
Agree disagree

679
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:21,720
Now the PC market is still gonna go and then honestly, I really think that the whole PC gaming market

680
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,720
It's gonna be dominated by the MMO

681
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:29,600
The more of them that come out the more addicts there are going to be and the more people who are going to upgrade their

682
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,920
machine, you know, even I bought a new graphics card so I could play Final Fantasy 11 and

683
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,600
Now it makes PSO look so beautiful

684
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,600
You know still

685
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:45,600
You'll be able to play Final Fantasy, you can already play Final Fantasy 11 on a console, and then Xbox 360 is going to get it too.

686
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,600
But it looks like shit on the console.

687
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,600
Well, the Xbox 360 is going to be nice, you've got to give it that.

688
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:55,600
Yeah, but you can still always build a PC that's going to kick its ass.

689
00:40:55,600 --> 00:41:05,600
I just think that as the consoles evolve, the PCs evolve too, so I think there will always be a place for PC games. I mean, I don't know.

690
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:10,980
You pull your console out of the box, six weeks later your computer technology is going

691
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,860
to make it obsolete.

692
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,700
It's already obsolete.

693
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:21,500
You can build computers that use the cell structure processors.

694
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,500
They have them.

695
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,500
They've been having them.

696
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,900
They've been out for, what, a year now?

697
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,900
The cell processors?

698
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:27,900
Yeah.

699
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:33,560
Yeah, they've been marketing them for all kinds of science research.

700
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,920
I think what the article tries to say is that this kind of stuff is too

701
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,240
expensive for most of us but the game consoles make them affordable

702
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:45,720
I think. Yeah, you buy the package deal but there are still going to be

703
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,600
the hardcore PC people who are going to keep it alive and the fact that the

704
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,120
pieces are so expensive is just more fuel.

705
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:58,560
And just right now you can't play Xbox Live and be on IRC at the same time.

706
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,680
Nope. I cannot do my homework playing PSO on the Xbox.

707
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:06,560
Now, who's to say that that won't change in the future with what all these next-gen systems

708
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,560
want to do?

709
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,560
But I don't know.

710
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,560
Loke, you have another thought on this?

711
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,320
It's never going to kill it off because if you're spending $400 on a graphics card, you're

712
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,120
especially kind of crazy anyway, so it's not going to matter.

713
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:18,240
I mean, honestly, who spends $400 on a graphics card?

714
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,240
I mean...

715
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,960
If you're going to spend that kind of money buying Alienware...

716
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,240
Oh, big man buys a high-end graphics card.

717
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,240
Guess what?

718
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:29,720
Next week, it's obsolete and my $20 graphics card is still whatever.

719
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:33,360
The whole thing is is you really don't need to spend all this money on console games.

720
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,060
People that are playing console games are going to still be playing console games and

721
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:40,240
people that are playing the PC games, you know what, because the PCs now, they're still

722
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,200
going to get better, the graphics here are going to get better, and it's still going

723
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,000
to be one step ahead of the console systems.

724
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,900
The console systems will get closer but whatever.

725
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,040
I play all of them, I don't care.

726
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,640
I've got them, I play them.

727
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,480
But you're also a special kind of crazy dark Sakura.

728
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:02,860
Okay, emulators are one thing, but I have to have the stupid half-broken joystick in

729
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:10,120
my hand so I can play Kix on my Atari 5200 and play it right, god damn it.

730
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:13,980
Alright, one last, we're running kind of long, but one last story.

731
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:16,240
Something to make Dark Sakura squeal a little bit here.

732
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,240
You're a fan of Stargate, yes?

733
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,240
Yes.

734
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,400
Well, you know how there's the Stargate SG-1 game coming out, right?

735
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,400
Yes.

736
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:27,200
Richard Dean Anderson, Michael Shanks, Amanda Tappe and Christopher Judge, that's

737
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,340
right, some of the cast,

738
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:32,960
they will be doing the voice acting for the game. I didn't doubt it. I played some of it at E3.

739
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,800
Very cool. It's definitely very first-person shooter-y, but

740
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,040
they got them looking right. And you know, though, a bit of trivia.

741
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:45,160
You know Richard Dean Anderson was MacGyver.

742
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:48,800
Oh yeah. But Dude was also

743
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:54,200
in a few episodes of MacGyver 2. July is the release date for that game, so you kids

744
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:54,960
look for it.

745
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,820
That's gonna bring another additional Orange Lounge Radio to go to a close. Final

746
00:43:58,820 --> 00:43:59,680
thoughts, Loki?

747
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,720
I have my headache still, it needs to go away,

748
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:07,240
and I loaned out Grand Theft Auto San Andreas,

749
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:14,160
what was I thinking? Dark Sakura. Reject, false icons, and happy birthday to the old man.

750
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,280
And my final thought is

751
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:22,140
My birthday is coming up very soon and I hope you're all going to get me something lovely.

752
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:29,320
My second final thought is vote for us on Podcast Alley.

753
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:32,320
Go there now.

754
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,320
Don't hesitate.

755
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:36,340
Go there now because if you vote us, we get better.

756
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,920
Don't you feel like it's running for student council though?

757
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:39,920
No, no, no.

758
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:44,360
They need to vote for us so that my ego can inflate to astronomical proportions.

759
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,080
You need to go now.

760
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:51,160
Sally, honestly, go vote for us. Do it. And vote every month. Don't just vote once, vote

761
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:54,760
every month. I, your favorite internet celebrity, beseeches

762
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,800
you. Vote!

763
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,320
Vote or die! Vote or die!

764
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:06,640
As P. Diddy says, vote or die. Alright, have a good one you guys, we'll see you next time

765
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,640
on the Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

766
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:15,080
That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition. This podcast is a proud

767
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:22,080
part of www.orangeloungeradio.com. See you next update!
