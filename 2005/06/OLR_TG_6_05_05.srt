9
00:01:47,486 --> 00:01:51,028
[SPEAKER_05]: First off, though, I want to give a big thank you to one of the podcast directories out there.

10
00:01:51,068 --> 00:01:57,411
[SPEAKER_05]: It's PodcastShuffle.com because they made us their podcast of the day, week, moment.

11
00:01:57,431 --> 00:01:58,972
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of his favorite podcasts.

12
00:01:59,392 --> 00:01:59,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

13
00:02:00,852 --> 00:02:02,873
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes me all go squeak.

14
00:02:03,334 --> 00:02:03,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

15
00:02:03,714 --> 00:02:04,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we appreciate that.

16
00:02:04,654 --> 00:02:07,335

[SPEAKER_05]: And we really appreciate all your guys' support.

18
00:02:09,576 --> 00:02:11,978
[SPEAKER_02]: The Ferret is so happy that he had a seizure.

19
00:02:12,358 --> 00:02:12,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

20
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, good to know.

21
00:02:16,725 --> 00:02:21,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's start off with a little bit of how was your gaming week, the type of stuff you've been playing this week.

22
00:02:21,867 --> 00:02:23,068
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll start off with Loki tonight.

23
00:02:23,148 --> 00:02:24,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what kind of games have you been playing this week?

24
00:02:25,109 --> 00:02:27,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I played not too much in the realm of games.

25
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:34,674
[SPEAKER_04]: I played a little bit of Rengoku, just, you know, killing more stuff on the same level, getting more experience.

26
00:02:35,247 --> 00:02:38,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't beat this stupid game because it's just boring.

27
00:02:38,928 --> 00:02:41,949
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of those ones where you're so far into it now you just have to beat the damn thing, right?

28
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:45,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really, but it's just not that great.

29
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,331
[SPEAKER_04]: It just doesn't get much harder.

30
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:52,272
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, the first generation of PSP games just kind of blew.

31
00:02:52,432 --> 00:02:54,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why, but... Whoa, whoa, whoa.

32
00:02:54,433 --> 00:02:55,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Luminous, hello.

33
00:02:56,254 --> 00:03:01,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the first generation PSP games blew, okay.

34
00:03:01,895 --> 00:03:03,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Granted, there are some good ones, but...

35
00:03:04,411 --> 00:03:05,832
[SPEAKER_04]: There's really not too much out there.

36
00:03:05,972 --> 00:03:07,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Smart Bomb, for example, sucked.

37
00:03:07,974 --> 00:03:13,779
[SPEAKER_04]: However, my boss gave me a clean copy of it, so I was able to take it back for free, and I still have Smart Bomb.

38
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:17,081
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I got all my money back, and I got the game for free, basically.

39
00:03:17,482 --> 00:03:18,002
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's nice.

40
00:03:18,202 --> 00:03:21,705
[SPEAKER_04]: But now I have $90 in credit to GameStop, and I have nothing to buy there.

41
00:03:21,725 --> 00:03:21,705
$90?

42
00:03:21,845 --> 00:03:22,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

43
00:03:22,265 --> 00:03:23,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Dang.

44
00:03:24,207 --> 00:03:33,294
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, um, also, I played a little bit of the Simpsons arcade game on my meme cabinet, because I had to fire that up to show Nelly's parents what that was.

45
00:03:33,534 --> 00:03:34,155
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, um,

46
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:35,599
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

47
00:03:54,226 --> 00:03:55,647
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakra, how was your gaming week?

48
00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:56,447
[SPEAKER_04]: I played lots and lots of PSO

49
00:04:17,794 --> 00:04:18,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue Burst, correct?

50
00:04:18,574 --> 00:04:19,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Blue Burst.

51
00:04:19,796 --> 00:04:22,998
[SPEAKER_02]: I played some Silent Hill 3 and then turned it off because I was kind of bored.

52
00:04:23,059 --> 00:04:24,400
[SPEAKER_02]: And I watched Dan beat Fire Emblem.

53
00:04:25,361 --> 00:04:26,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Which Fire Emblem?

54
00:04:26,101 --> 00:04:26,582
[SPEAKER_05]: The new game?

55
00:04:26,602 --> 00:04:27,282
[SPEAKER_02]: The Sacred Stones.

56
00:04:27,563 --> 00:04:28,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay, cool.

57
00:04:28,444 --> 00:04:29,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the one that just came out.

58
00:04:29,344 --> 00:04:30,606
[SPEAKER_02]: The GameCube one that's not out yet.

59
00:04:31,747 --> 00:04:32,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, alright.

60
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:33,028
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um...

61
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:36,323
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I got to see the end of Fire Emblem.

62
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:40,706
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like all he plays now is, well, let's put in the Game Boy Advance player and play Fire Emblem.

63
00:04:41,126 --> 00:04:47,491
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Fire Emblem was one of those games that was popular in Japan for a long time, but it took a long time to come over here.

64
00:04:47,651 --> 00:04:49,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what they're playing today?

65
00:04:50,513 --> 00:04:53,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Busted out the Super Nintendo and popped in the Super Famicom card of Fire Emblem 3.

66
00:04:54,276 --> 00:04:55,717
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw that when I went over there.

67
00:04:55,777 --> 00:05:00,000
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw that one of your friends was playing like a Japanese game on the Super Nintendo.

68
00:05:00,681 --> 00:05:02,502
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the kind of stuff I only see happen at your house.

69
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:04,277
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

70
00:05:24,235 --> 00:05:34,777
[SPEAKER_02]: But I watched Sega Fantasy 5, which was frustrating because the text would move just fast enough that I would catch words and bits and pieces of Kana and not be able to read the whole thing.

71
00:05:34,797 --> 00:05:38,518
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was like... That's cool.

72
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:39,418
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know that existed.

73
00:05:39,438 --> 00:05:39,978
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of funny.

74
00:05:42,118 --> 00:05:44,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Sega fanboys and fangirls are pretty rabid.

75
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:48,320
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see about posting a link on the OrangeLoungeRadio.com live journal forum.

76
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Very nice.

77
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:49,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice plug.

78
00:05:50,421 --> 00:05:55,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, my gaming week, you know, there's not a whole lot of new stuff out there that I really wanted to check out.

79
00:05:56,845 --> 00:06:08,791
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to buy a new DS game this week, but really, all that's out right now, I think the only game that came out was Madagascar, which is a game I might be excited about if I was seven years old, but I'm not, so I could care less.

80
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:11,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't Polarium... I played another game, actually.

81
00:06:11,573 --> 00:06:12,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, what's that?

82
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots and lots of the Pac-Pix demo at GameStop.

83
00:06:15,515 --> 00:06:15,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

84
00:06:16,778 --> 00:06:17,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Medios is coming out.

85
00:06:17,838 --> 00:06:18,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Medios is out June 27th.

86
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,619
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the day after my birthday and I couldn't be more happier that the DS is getting that.

87
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Sigma Star Saga is coming out, Game Boy Advance, I think.

88
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, yeah, I think that's Game Boy Advance.

89
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:37,502
[SPEAKER_04]: That one's actually supposed to be pretty interesting because it's, imagine, you know, your typical RPG, but instead of the random battles, it's random side-scroller shooters.

90
00:06:38,183 --> 00:06:38,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's cool.

91
00:06:39,463 --> 00:06:39,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh.

92
00:06:39,703 --> 00:06:39,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

93
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:40,590
Interesting.

94
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:46,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, so since I didn't really get anything new, I went back to my collection and I said, well, what are some games I really didn't play enough of?

95
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:51,336
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm checking out Mario DS, Mario 64 DS, because I really didn't get that far into it.

96
00:06:51,356 --> 00:06:54,458
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I got about 30 stars, and then I said, eh, screw it, I got more games to play.

97
00:06:54,838 --> 00:07:00,561
[SPEAKER_05]: But I really want more minigames right now, because surprisingly enough, the minigames to me were the best part of Mario DS.

98
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:09,846
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and also, I don't know if it's just me, but Mario 64, and I'm going to get a lot of crap and hate letters for this, I think Mario 64 is one of the most overrated games ever.

99
00:07:10,373 --> 00:07:13,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I see a lot of lists out there.

100
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:16,397
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how every website out there has got to have a top 100 list.

101
00:07:16,817 --> 00:07:23,561
[SPEAKER_05]: And Super Mario 64 is always in the top three of the greatest platformers or the greatest games even.

102
00:07:23,881 --> 00:07:25,963
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I have to disagree with you.

103
00:07:26,303 --> 00:07:30,145
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have special memories of Mario 64.

104
00:07:30,746 --> 00:07:34,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Dan and I would play Mario 64 together and bond over it.

105
00:07:35,231 --> 00:07:37,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, see, you got special stuff there.

106
00:07:38,132 --> 00:07:41,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, add one single word in there, then it makes all the sense in the world.

107
00:07:41,672 --> 00:07:42,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario Kart 64.

108
00:07:43,413 --> 00:07:44,273
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the game.

109
00:07:44,313 --> 00:07:45,273
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the game.

110
00:07:45,353 --> 00:07:45,553
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.

111
00:07:45,573 --> 00:07:46,973
[SPEAKER_05]: That game rocked.

112
00:07:47,014 --> 00:07:49,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Mario 64 for me was nothing but a bunch of frustrating cameras.

113
00:07:50,054 --> 00:07:50,854
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

114
00:07:50,874 --> 00:07:54,095
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it was darn innovative at the time.

115
00:07:54,295 --> 00:07:55,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I got to give it that.

116
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:58,836
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know if I would place it so near the top in the great...

117
00:07:59,571 --> 00:08:00,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Mario Sunshine was cool.

118
00:08:00,131 --> 00:08:00,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Shine get!

119
00:08:00,612 --> 00:08:01,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Mario Sunshine to me was not that bad.

120
00:08:01,713 --> 00:08:02,873
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was... It was like Mario 64 with water.

121
00:08:02,893 --> 00:08:09,358
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate to say it was better than Mario 64, but I was entertained longer by Mario Sunshine than I was in Mario 64 initially.

122
00:08:09,378 --> 00:08:10,659
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, folks, if you have a GameCube,

123
00:08:28,427 --> 00:08:29,208
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

124
00:08:48,092 --> 00:08:48,792
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's about it.

125
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,266
[SPEAKER_05]: August is going to be the release date for Geist.

126
00:09:20,866 --> 00:09:21,847
[SPEAKER_04]: I keep up on that stuff.

127
00:09:22,387 --> 00:09:26,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I know you got it for your work stuff, but you have to make it sound exciting for our podcast.

128
00:09:26,989 --> 00:09:27,829
[SPEAKER_04]: It is exciting.

129
00:09:27,849 --> 00:09:28,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you do that for me?

130
00:09:28,909 --> 00:09:33,051
[SPEAKER_05]: It is exciting because there's not that many good GameCube games coming out.

131
00:09:33,929 --> 00:09:35,731
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit of PSP news.

132
00:09:35,931 --> 00:09:37,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, you'll love this one.

133
00:09:37,492 --> 00:09:41,635
[SPEAKER_05]: PSP is getting some bonafide actual porn.

134
00:09:42,055 --> 00:09:43,016
[SPEAKER_05]: I read about that.

135
00:09:43,056 --> 00:09:43,597
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

136
00:09:44,397 --> 00:09:50,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Not somebody putting the porn on their memory sticks, as most PSP users probably did the first day they got it.

137
00:09:50,021 --> 00:09:50,602
[SPEAKER_05]: UMD porn.

138
00:09:50,982 --> 00:09:54,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Actual UMD porn coming out in Japan.

139
00:09:54,745 --> 00:10:02,071
[SPEAKER_05]: And the company that's putting this out is Glaze, G-L-A-Y apostrophe Z, starting off July 8th.

140
00:10:03,091 --> 00:10:08,534
[SPEAKER_05]: The titles will be anywhere between ¥1,995 and just under ¥4,000.

141
00:10:08,754 --> 00:10:11,515
[SPEAKER_05]: That's about $18 to $37 US.

142
00:10:12,436 --> 00:10:17,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I will horribly butcher some of these names if I try to pronounce them.

143
00:10:17,218 --> 00:10:19,179
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I like some of this.

144
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:23,422
[SPEAKER_05]: On July 22nd, Bybody Aeroterrorist Noah.

145
00:10:24,662 --> 00:10:26,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Aeroterrorist, what is that?

146
00:10:26,721 --> 00:10:27,261
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

147
00:10:27,621 --> 00:10:30,262
[SPEAKER_05]: And let's see, HMP Countdown 2005.

148
00:10:30,842 --> 00:10:32,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, humping?

149
00:10:33,163 --> 00:10:33,903
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, HMP.

150
00:10:33,943 --> 00:10:34,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Hump Countdown!

151
00:10:35,564 --> 00:10:40,706
[SPEAKER_05]: July 8th, Kanishiro Ana, Koiku Soap Jewel.

152
00:10:41,006 --> 00:10:42,486
[SPEAKER_05]: I just like that because it has the word soap in it.

153
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:45,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it's like Bubble Bath Babes, the porn.

154
00:10:45,207 --> 00:10:46,167
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

155
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:47,568
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't.

156
00:10:47,768 --> 00:10:48,728
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

157
00:11:10,663 --> 00:11:12,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this something we're going to see in the U.S.?

158
00:11:12,484 --> 00:11:13,905
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, honestly, probably.

159
00:11:14,525 --> 00:11:19,789
[SPEAKER_04]: You know who I'd actually see probably putting stuff out for it would be like Playboy, something like that.

160
00:11:20,249 --> 00:11:23,231
[SPEAKER_05]: We did have a story a couple months ago about Playboy.com doing something.

161
00:11:23,251 --> 00:11:24,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, their iPod crap.

162
00:11:25,472 --> 00:11:28,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, honestly, you might see some of that stuff.

163
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:32,917
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it'd be better as downloadable content because, honestly, I couldn't see buying.

164
00:11:32,997 --> 00:11:37,900
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, really, I just can't see a situation where this would come in handy.

165
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,140
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean,

166
00:11:39,212 --> 00:11:40,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Come in handy.

167
00:11:40,072 --> 00:11:41,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it?

168
00:11:42,433 --> 00:11:43,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, whatever.

169
00:11:43,353 --> 00:11:48,435
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't see it being something I'd spend money on.

170
00:11:48,455 --> 00:11:50,696
[SPEAKER_04]: But then again, I don't see myself spending money on UMDs.

171
00:11:51,096 --> 00:11:53,437
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's a kind of story that ties in there.

172
00:11:53,557 --> 00:11:54,998
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if you can cover it.

173
00:11:56,658 --> 00:12:00,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, we're talking about the first two UMDs actually hit 100,000 in sales.

174
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:00,920
[SPEAKER_04]: 100,000 units sold.

175
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,620
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first two would be...

176
00:12:07,677 --> 00:12:08,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Air Force One took nine months.

177
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:24,877
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.com

178
00:12:49,173 --> 00:12:49,753
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, though?

179
00:12:49,774 --> 00:12:50,574
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what it reminds me of?

180
00:12:50,634 --> 00:12:52,336
[SPEAKER_05]: When did DVD players really take off?

181
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:53,717
[SPEAKER_05]: When PlayStation 2 came out.

182
00:12:54,177 --> 00:13:02,224
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe it's kind of similar, where people don't want to buy portable DVD players, but they'll buy a PSP, which is like a portable DVD player.

183
00:13:02,304 --> 00:13:02,685
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

184
00:13:02,845 --> 00:13:03,525
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't explain it.

185
00:13:04,086 --> 00:13:04,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, whatever.

186
00:13:04,646 --> 00:13:05,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's cool.

187
00:13:05,507 --> 00:13:06,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever makes you happy.

188
00:13:06,128 --> 00:13:07,569
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, you had a comment?

189
00:13:07,709 --> 00:13:08,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Porn on the PSP?

190
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's going to be really big in Japan.

191
00:13:10,772 --> 00:13:12,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, it's not going to play.

192
00:13:12,733 --> 00:13:13,414
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't think so, huh?

193
00:13:13,574 --> 00:13:14,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't think they're going to do it.

194
00:13:14,515 --> 00:13:14,835
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

195
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:16,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Age demographic, it's not going to happen.

196
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:17,463
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

197
00:13:18,763 --> 00:13:20,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, PSP news.

198
00:13:20,184 --> 00:13:26,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, going along with PSP news in Japan, they're saying it's slumping over in Tokyo, actually, in Japan.

199
00:13:26,987 --> 00:13:30,568
[SPEAKER_05]: A new story coming out of Tokyo saying that the sales of the PSP are slumping.

200
00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:48,286
[SPEAKER_05]: from the week of May 23rd to 29th only four PSP games were in the complete top 50 none of them cracking the top 20 whereas you look on the other half of it six Nintendo DS titles in the top 20 Nintendogs

201
00:13:49,046 --> 00:13:50,168
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the puppies.

202
00:13:50,188 --> 00:13:51,849
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Frisbee with the puppies.

203
00:13:51,869 --> 00:13:53,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this a sign of things to come?

204
00:13:53,611 --> 00:13:54,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the DS going to...

205
00:14:05,768 --> 00:14:08,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Outdo the PSP here in America?

206
00:14:08,591 --> 00:14:10,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, it's America.

207
00:14:11,093 --> 00:14:12,695
[SPEAKER_02]: We want it bigger, faster.

208
00:14:13,055 --> 00:14:14,417
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to do more shit.

209
00:14:14,457 --> 00:14:17,760
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to do more Sony because the world sucks the cock of Sony.

210
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:22,765
[SPEAKER_04]: There was honestly a big launch of games from the beginning.

211
00:14:23,646 --> 00:14:25,688
[SPEAKER_04]: They had about 20 or so games.

212
00:14:26,969 --> 00:14:28,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's dead as far as what's coming out.

213
00:14:29,266 --> 00:14:30,206
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what's happening.

214
00:14:30,266 --> 00:14:31,467
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like there's only a couple games.

215
00:14:31,507 --> 00:14:34,268
[SPEAKER_04]: People are tired of the old games, and now they're waiting for more stuff.

216
00:14:34,448 --> 00:14:35,848
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in DS syndrome now.

217
00:14:36,028 --> 00:14:37,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly what I was thinking.

218
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,249
[SPEAKER_05]: PSP is now suffering the same thing.

219
00:14:39,309 --> 00:14:42,410
[SPEAKER_05]: DS is, I would say to most extent, still suffering through.

220
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Both systems, to me, are at a dead still.

221
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:49,352
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have any really great games out on the horizon.

222
00:14:50,313 --> 00:14:53,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Meteos on the DS, of course, coming later this month.

223
00:14:53,774 --> 00:14:54,514
[SPEAKER_02]: That's by the Res guy.

224
00:14:55,895 --> 00:15:00,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking at the PSP calendar, Batman Begins is coming out in June.

225
00:15:00,997 --> 00:15:04,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Midnight Club 3 Dub Edition, now that could be very cool, also coming out in June.

226
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:09,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Currently the only game slated for July, according to the calendar I have here, is Star Wars Episode 3.

227
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:12,222
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's really not a whole lot of stuff coming out this summer.

228
00:15:12,242 --> 00:15:13,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Not necessarily.

229
00:15:13,182 --> 00:15:14,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Armored Core is going to be coming out.

230
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Armored Core Formula.

231
00:15:17,224 --> 00:15:17,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Pop Oculus.

232
00:15:18,405 --> 00:15:23,707
[SPEAKER_04]: And Dead to Rights will be coming out for the PSP as well in July or June, I believe.

233
00:15:24,167 --> 00:15:25,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are going to be coming out.

234
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:29,994
[SPEAKER_04]: And I haven't heard anything about Star Wars yet, The Revenge of the Sith.

235
00:15:30,014 --> 00:15:31,075
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that got pushed back.

236
00:15:31,235 --> 00:15:31,936
[SPEAKER_04]: And same with...

237
00:15:33,568 --> 00:15:35,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Midnight Club 3, I think.

238
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:39,771
[SPEAKER_05]: DS, on the other hand, DS is starting to pick up a little steam here.

239
00:15:39,831 --> 00:15:42,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, they've been slumping through the past few months, so they're starting to pick up a little steam.

240
00:15:42,513 --> 00:15:48,576
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got GoldenEye, Kirby, Canvas Curse, Bomberman, Meteos, Tom Clancy, Splinter Cell all this month.

241
00:15:48,776 --> 00:15:49,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Nanostray.

242
00:15:49,856 --> 00:15:50,557
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be awesome.

243
00:15:50,757 --> 00:15:55,259
[SPEAKER_05]: And Nanostray in July, along with Spyro Shadow Legacy also coming out in July.

244
00:15:55,619 --> 00:15:59,101
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can kind of see that it's starting to pick up a little bit of steam, whereas the PSP is in that...

245
00:16:00,345 --> 00:16:08,267
[SPEAKER_05]: At least in my opinion, now everybody's got a different opinion, but for me and the games I'm into, PSP's slumping right now, whereas DS is finally starting to pick up steam.

246
00:16:08,707 --> 00:16:13,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but the PSP is going to be getting a lot of play in my house from me when Popokoros comes out.

247
00:16:13,988 --> 00:16:23,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Aren't you getting sick of this crap, though, where the launches put all their games out for the launch titles and then it's dead for like four months?

248
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:26,391
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm honestly kind of looking forward to seeing Sony get screwed over for their arrogance.

249
00:16:26,772 --> 00:16:27,652
[SPEAKER_04]: That right there, though.

250
00:16:27,892 --> 00:16:28,532
[SPEAKER_04]: See that right there?

251
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:30,683
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what's going to make the revolution rock.

252
00:16:30,883 --> 00:16:35,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, if the next-gen systems pull this same crap, it's going to be over for one of them.

253
00:16:35,405 --> 00:16:45,470
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not usually one for resting on your laurels, but Nintendo has always had, even though they haven't been at the top of everything, they've had the staying power.

254
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,391
[SPEAKER_02]: They are stable.

255
00:16:46,811 --> 00:16:55,875
[SPEAKER_05]: See, again, this backs up what I said last week when I said I don't think that it's such a bad thing that revolution wasn't shown at E3 because I think they're taking their sweet-ass time so that they can.

256
00:16:56,776 --> 00:16:57,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they can.

257
00:16:58,081 --> 00:17:00,402
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing it because they can, because they know.

258
00:17:01,082 --> 00:17:03,483
[SPEAKER_02]: They have been a trusted name for how long?

259
00:17:04,643 --> 00:17:05,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Was Sony there in the beginning?

260
00:17:06,364 --> 00:17:08,664
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Sony was the bitch of Nintendo for a while.

261
00:17:10,145 --> 00:17:14,066
[SPEAKER_02]: They did the sound processor for the Super Nintendo, and we're working on the TV system.

262
00:17:14,086 --> 00:17:15,366
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get angry emails on that one.

263
00:17:15,606 --> 00:17:16,807
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true.

264
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:19,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine with me here, just for a second.

265
00:17:19,507 --> 00:17:21,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's where Nintendo's going to be revolutionized.

266
00:17:21,328 --> 00:17:22,548
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura's not finished.

267
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:23,609
[SPEAKER_02]: I still had a rant to go.

268
00:17:25,974 --> 00:17:28,636
[SPEAKER_02]: But Nintendo has been there since the late 80s.

269
00:17:29,096 --> 00:17:38,642
[SPEAKER_02]: There has always been a Nintendo system since, I would say, right after the... I think the Master System was out first.

270
00:17:39,002 --> 00:17:40,703
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just about to ask you, though.

271
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Couldn't you say the same thing about Sega?

272
00:17:42,164 --> 00:17:42,984
[SPEAKER_05]: They were there in the beginning, too.

273
00:17:43,004 --> 00:17:43,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Look what happened to them.

274
00:17:43,905 --> 00:17:50,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but Sega actually started off doing third-party publishing because I've got some Sega games on my Clicovision.

275
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:57,052
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they went, and they were pretty strong, but I think that they sort of shot themselves in the foot with the Dreamcast.

276
00:17:58,152 --> 00:18:04,694
[SPEAKER_02]: It was there early, it was out, but they needed to market it a little differently, I think.

277
00:18:05,214 --> 00:18:09,695
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they actually really got fucked over by the fact that Sony said, hey, we're going to jump in the market too.

278
00:18:10,876 --> 00:18:12,196
[SPEAKER_02]: That is what screwed over the Dreamcast.

279
00:18:12,236 --> 00:18:13,036
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a matter of timing.

280
00:18:14,197 --> 00:18:14,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

281
00:18:15,217 --> 00:18:18,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, I was going to say, imagine if you will, because this is why the revolution is going to rock.

282
00:18:19,226 --> 00:18:19,746
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

283
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,481
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to build Delim to your DS.

284
00:18:44,501 --> 00:18:45,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Put it in sleep mode and take it with you.

285
00:18:46,142 --> 00:18:47,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting thought.

286
00:18:47,323 --> 00:18:47,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting thought.

287
00:18:47,983 --> 00:18:48,603
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that idea.

288
00:18:48,803 --> 00:18:49,584
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see what happens.

289
00:18:49,904 --> 00:18:50,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on, though, anyway.

290
00:18:50,905 --> 00:18:52,106
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got a lot of news to get through tonight.

291
00:18:52,646 --> 00:18:53,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Dirge of Cerebrus.

292
00:18:54,107 --> 00:18:55,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Cerebrus?

293
00:18:55,488 --> 00:18:56,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Cerebus.

294
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:56,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Cerebus.

295
00:18:57,409 --> 00:18:59,030
[SPEAKER_05]: My horrible pronunciation skills coming out.

296
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:01,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Or as we call it, Vincent May Cry.

297
00:19:01,111 --> 00:19:03,833
[SPEAKER_05]: The Final Fantasy VII sequel.

298
00:19:05,325 --> 00:19:12,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Import Website is up and you get new downloads and you get more information on the story and everything going on.

299
00:19:12,807 --> 00:19:33,153
[SPEAKER_05]: You can check that out at square-enix.co.jp slash games slash ps2 slash dcff7 Now obviously you probably weren't writing that down so just type in square-enix.co.jp You have no idea how big my Vincent fangirlism has been.

300
00:19:33,908 --> 00:19:43,753
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a directory of something like 3,000 doujinshi official art, fan art, pictures of Vincent.

301
00:19:44,374 --> 00:19:45,594
[SPEAKER_02]: And I lost them when my hard drive crashed.

302
00:19:46,315 --> 00:19:47,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

303
00:19:47,495 --> 00:19:48,636
[SPEAKER_05]: I was a scary fangirl.

304
00:19:48,656 --> 00:19:52,158
[SPEAKER_05]: When I played through Final Fantasy VII the first time, I never got Vincent.

305
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,477
[SPEAKER_02]: GameStop is already taking pre-orders for Halo 3

306
00:20:16,661 --> 00:20:24,844
[SPEAKER_05]: which kind of doesn't surprise me considering every time I buy something at GameStop or really any store these days, they always want me to pre-order something.

307
00:20:26,504 --> 00:20:27,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you like to pre-order?

308
00:20:27,325 --> 00:20:27,785
[SPEAKER_02]: It's smart.

309
00:20:28,285 --> 00:20:33,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand, but it's just... You know, the thing is, though, is by getting your pre-order in early, you're guaranteed for shipment?

310
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:41,749
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally don't do it because I'm a very spontaneous person and I like to buy games, just walk in, and I feel like buying this day.

311
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,410
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not a big pre-order person.

312
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:43,870
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really not.

313
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,351
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have never been denied a game I want.

314
00:20:47,642 --> 00:20:48,843
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

315
00:21:13,393 --> 00:21:13,913
[SPEAKER_05]: So what do you think?

316
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:14,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there any merit to this?

317
00:21:15,013 --> 00:21:16,614
[SPEAKER_05]: I go, no, this is BS.

318
00:21:16,914 --> 00:21:20,475
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's just a mistake, just like, what was it, they had marijuana.

319
00:21:20,995 --> 00:21:21,955
[SPEAKER_05]: That was exactly what I was going to say.

320
00:21:21,975 --> 00:21:27,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Target.com was selling marijuana at one point, which was some web kid's joke.

321
00:21:27,997 --> 00:21:33,698
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think you can really trust Walmart.com as your source for gaming.

322
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:37,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, I would have heard about it already because it would have been announced.

323
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,520
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have had to put it on my list.

324
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,781
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways, the thing is for, what was I going to say?

325
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:46,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Halo 3 is coming out when the PS3 is put out.

326
00:22:11,871 --> 00:22:22,100
[SPEAKER_05]: I will buy the Xbox 360 when Halo 3 is out because there's a better chance that the Xbox 360 might get its first price cut before then in order to entice sales of it.

327
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,441
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to matter at my house.

328
00:22:23,481 --> 00:22:24,061
[SPEAKER_02]: We get them all.

329
00:22:24,362 --> 00:22:24,722
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

330
00:22:24,742 --> 00:22:33,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of which, since we're talking about stuff in vendors and all that wonderful stuff, PSP, there's rumors about it actually getting a price cut to $200.

331
00:22:33,189 --> 00:22:34,630
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard about this.

332
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,793
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason why they are saying that this is going to happen and...

333
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:42,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Best Buy and EB Games are now stocking the official stuff like the Sony headphones, the little soft case.

334
00:23:01,994 --> 00:23:09,781
[SPEAKER_04]: The 32 meg memory stick card and the battery chargers, they're all sale individually, which this stuff's usually bundled with it.

335
00:23:10,162 --> 00:23:13,585
[SPEAKER_04]: So if there's going to be a non-bundle, then it's going to drop in price.

336
00:23:14,846 --> 00:23:16,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, logically, but okay, that's...

337
00:23:17,512 --> 00:23:18,333
[SPEAKER_05]: All good, I guess.

338
00:23:18,413 --> 00:23:24,217
[SPEAKER_05]: But then at the same time, it doesn't make much sense because you have to have a memory stick with a PSP, so you're going to end up buying that separately.

339
00:23:24,557 --> 00:23:27,219
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to have some type of charger, so you're going to end up buying that.

340
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:33,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, if I think what's going to happen, though, the charger, I could see maybe a replacement memory stick as a replacement.

341
00:23:34,584 --> 00:23:38,306
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if they were going to do one, it would be just system, memory stick, charger.

342
00:23:39,087 --> 00:23:39,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's fine.

343
00:23:40,489 --> 00:23:42,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Dark Sakura, what do you have to tell the kids about tonight?

344
00:23:42,911 --> 00:23:45,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Today's bit of advice is how to jump from a bridge or cliff into a river.

345
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:13,224
[SPEAKER_02]: so that when people tell you to take a flying leap, you'll know what to do.

346
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:16,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, kids, don't really try this at home.

347
00:24:17,847 --> 00:24:18,587
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want to get sued.

348
00:24:18,727 --> 00:24:21,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, besides, if you have a cliff or bridge at home, that's just weird.

349
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:22,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey!

350
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,171
[SPEAKER_02]: My advice column, thank you.

351
00:24:26,232 --> 00:24:28,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, jump feet first.

352
00:24:29,153 --> 00:24:31,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Two, keep your body entirely vertical.

353
00:24:32,035 --> 00:24:33,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Three, squeeze your feet together.

354
00:24:33,656 --> 00:24:34,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Belly flop!

355
00:24:35,677 --> 00:24:36,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob?

356
00:24:36,778 --> 00:24:37,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

357
00:24:37,498 --> 00:24:37,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

358
00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:38,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Four,

359
00:24:39,409 --> 00:24:42,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Enter the water feet first, but cleanse your buttocks together.

360
00:24:43,051 --> 00:24:46,593
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do not, water may rush in and cause severe internal damage.

361
00:24:47,454 --> 00:24:48,774
[SPEAKER_04]: My ass exploded.

362
00:24:50,175 --> 00:24:50,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Five.

363
00:24:51,276 --> 00:24:55,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Protect your crotch area by covering it with your hands.

364
00:24:55,838 --> 00:24:58,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, can you imagine?

365
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,300
Sorry.

366
00:24:59,881 --> 00:25:00,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Six.

367
00:25:00,901 --> 00:25:03,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Immediately after you hit the water, spread your arms and legs wide.

368
00:25:04,023 --> 00:25:07,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Move them back and forth to generate resistance, which will slow your plunge to the bottom.

369
00:25:08,386 --> 00:25:09,066
[SPEAKER_02]: But my, uh...

370
00:25:09,855 --> 00:25:11,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Honest final piece of advice on this.

371
00:25:14,276 --> 00:25:14,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Drown.

372
00:25:15,896 --> 00:25:17,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, avoid rocks.

373
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:19,177
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like the major one right there.

374
00:25:19,957 --> 00:25:23,757
[SPEAKER_04]: If you see rocks poking out of the water, it might not be a good idea to jump towards it.

375
00:25:27,558 --> 00:25:28,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Please don't do that at home.

376
00:25:28,758 --> 00:25:29,619
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not Vin Diesel.

377
00:25:29,639 --> 00:25:31,159
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't need to be jumping off of bridges.

378
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:32,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Cliff diving?

379
00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:36,140
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll jump off the rainbow bridge.

380
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:37,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

381
00:25:39,195 --> 00:25:39,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Wowie wow.

382
00:25:40,236 --> 00:25:42,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Did he remember to tighten his buttocks when he jumped?

383
00:25:42,978 --> 00:25:43,839
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to ask him.

384
00:25:43,879 --> 00:25:44,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, please ask him.

385
00:25:46,201 --> 00:25:46,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

386
00:25:48,103 --> 00:25:49,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Gaming companies.

387
00:25:49,304 --> 00:25:56,591
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that most of you guys are located in Silicon Valley, although the rest of you guys are... Some are located elsewhere in the nation, New York, wherever.

388
00:25:57,131 --> 00:25:57,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Louisiana.

389
00:25:57,952 --> 00:25:58,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Louisiana.

390
00:25:59,364 --> 00:26:27,129
[SPEAKER_05]: is trying to get you to move your company over there recently passed Louisiana bill 341 it grants game developers generous tax credits if they relocate to Louisiana it was unanimously passed by the Senate it gives a 10% state tax income credit to studios that spend anywhere between $300,000 and $8 million by setting up shop in Louisiana and then remaining there for one year

391
00:26:28,052 --> 00:26:30,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you see game companies rushing to Louisiana?

392
00:26:30,414 --> 00:26:33,316
[SPEAKER_05]: It could happen if they can live through the freaking humidity.

393
00:26:33,536 --> 00:26:38,020
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the first thing I was going to comment on, too, is that, you know... I have been there.

394
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:44,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's one thing that Louisiana, and with all due respect to our listeners in Louisiana, I love you guys for tuning in, but let's think about it.

395
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:49,389
[SPEAKER_05]: They probably don't have to blow on Nintendo cartridges down there to get them to work anymore because it's so damn humid.

396
00:26:49,689 --> 00:26:51,171
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you just have to deal with them resting.

397
00:26:52,412 --> 00:26:53,492
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, you laugh.

398
00:26:54,233 --> 00:26:55,554
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I laugh because it's true.

399
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:56,435
[SPEAKER_02]: But it happened.

400
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:00,030
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd have to clean your contacts with alcohol.

401
00:27:02,092 --> 00:27:05,494
[SPEAKER_05]: For our buddies over in the UK, DarkSakura's got your back.

402
00:27:05,514 --> 00:27:07,335
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going on for the British folk?

403
00:27:07,736 --> 00:27:09,497
[SPEAKER_02]: This is about the Gizmondo.

404
00:27:10,538 --> 00:27:12,619
[SPEAKER_02]: The Gizmondo is put out by a UK company.

405
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually looking over their stats, it's a pretty, pretty impressive little system.

406
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:18,583
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to play it.

407
00:27:18,623 --> 00:27:19,664
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to play Johnny Whatever.

408
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:25,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of like a game where you wail hard on your guitar and then you have like a little karaoke mode that plays sort of like

409
00:27:27,071 --> 00:27:29,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Guitar Freaks meets Karaoke Revolution.

410
00:27:31,493 --> 00:27:34,414
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically it's going to be powered by Windows CE.

411
00:27:34,434 --> 00:27:37,715
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a 2.8 inch TFT color screen.

412
00:27:39,156 --> 00:27:46,099
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually supports MPEG-4 movie, multimedia messaging, digital camera, GPRS network.

413
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:50,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, it's looking like it's trying to really compete with the PSP.

414
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:53,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a run over of some of the features.

415
00:27:53,610 --> 00:28:08,398
[SPEAKER_02]: 400 MHz, ARM9 processor, 64-bit graphics processor, 8-way D-pad, left and right triggers, all these bajillion buttons on it, integrated digital camera, 3D game engine.

416
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:12,260
[SPEAKER_05]: But, DarkSakura, can you play pornography on it?

417
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:13,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Eventually.

418
00:28:13,921 --> 00:28:15,182
[SPEAKER_05]: MPEG-4 video, come on.

419
00:28:15,882 --> 00:28:17,443
[SPEAKER_02]: It has Windows Media Player 9 on it.

420
00:28:17,803 --> 00:28:18,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there you go.

421
00:28:19,784 --> 00:28:20,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Polyphonic ringtones.

422
00:28:20,984 --> 00:28:25,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently it's also going to try to kick Nokia back under the grave.

423
00:28:26,466 --> 00:28:27,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if they aren't already there.

424
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:29,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, but I mean, come on.

425
00:28:29,647 --> 00:28:31,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is like the nail in the coffin.

426
00:28:31,248 --> 00:28:32,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Games coming out.

427
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Conflict Vietnam.

428
00:28:33,089 --> 00:28:33,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Carmageddon.

429
00:28:34,309 --> 00:28:35,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Battle Stations Midway.

430
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:36,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Total Overdose.

431
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:37,430
[SPEAKER_02]: SSX 3.

432
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:39,831
[SPEAKER_02]: FIFA Soccer.

433
00:28:40,311 --> 00:28:40,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Sticky Balls.

434
00:28:41,552 --> 00:28:41,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Meh.

435
00:28:42,413 --> 00:28:42,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Rayman.

436
00:28:43,094 --> 00:28:50,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if they relocate to, you know, Louisiana, then that won't be a problem.

437
00:28:50,984 --> 00:28:56,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, that game Johnny Whatever, which we have pictures of on orangeelgeradio.com on my E3 gallery.

438
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:56,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

439
00:28:57,231 --> 00:28:59,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Any idea for a release date for our British friends?

440
00:28:59,895 --> 00:29:01,016
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

441
00:29:16,394 --> 00:29:16,794
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be good.

442
00:29:17,755 --> 00:29:20,457
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's a portable system, they don't exactly have to redo the specs.

443
00:29:20,838 --> 00:29:22,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's usually why games take so long.

444
00:29:22,339 --> 00:29:27,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they have to go from NTSC to PAL and all that.

445
00:29:27,243 --> 00:29:28,344
[SPEAKER_05]: That's usually why games get delayed.

446
00:29:28,364 --> 00:29:30,245
[SPEAKER_05]: But they won't have to worry about that with Gizmodo.

447
00:29:30,526 --> 00:29:35,250
[SPEAKER_02]: No, and the thing is, it's like the same reason you can play PAL discs on an NTSC on your computer.

448
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:36,371
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's the same difference.

449
00:29:38,091 --> 00:29:42,853
[SPEAKER_02]: But it really is looking like it's trying to go head-to-head with the PSP.

450
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:45,474
[SPEAKER_02]: And on top of that, it actually takes flash drive.

451
00:29:45,934 --> 00:29:50,395
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually see it as more, not so much PSP, but more N-Gage, what N-Gage really should have been.

452
00:29:51,695 --> 00:29:53,276
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like it's trying to bridge the fence.

453
00:29:53,376 --> 00:29:58,157
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to have to compare the N-Gage to anything, because nobody is deserving of that kind of punishment.

454
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:02,999
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know... But apparently it's being put out by Tiger.

455
00:30:03,019 --> 00:30:03,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

456
00:30:05,378 --> 00:30:09,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Tiger used to put out all those little LCD games back in the day.

457
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,901
[SPEAKER_02]: But Tiger's been around for a while.

458
00:30:12,281 --> 00:30:17,043
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, I honestly, honestly really think that I'm going to get a Gizmondo.

459
00:30:17,684 --> 00:30:23,026
[SPEAKER_02]: After playing it at E3, and also with just the excellent show they put on, it's looking like it's going to be big.

460
00:30:23,246 --> 00:30:26,267
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not going to get it just because you have every other console system known to man?

461
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:29,309
[SPEAKER_05]: I am a completion whore.

462
00:30:29,889 --> 00:30:32,130
[SPEAKER_05]: I will just borrow yours when you let me.

463
00:30:32,754 --> 00:30:38,202
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and honestly though, it actually was pretty comfortable to play You know how some systems just feel kind of out of whack in your hand?

464
00:30:39,272 --> 00:30:40,372
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt pretty comfortable.

465
00:30:41,413 --> 00:30:42,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you mean the taco?

466
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:47,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Gizmondo's going to have to wait in line because I still have to pick up a PSP, but I'm interested in Gizmondo.

467
00:30:47,335 --> 00:30:49,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't they just call it the Magic Taco Gaming System?

468
00:30:49,756 --> 00:30:50,697
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would sell better.

469
00:30:50,717 --> 00:30:51,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

470
00:30:52,157 --> 00:30:52,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

471
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:53,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Video taco!

472
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:55,239
[SPEAKER_02]: We love the taco!

473
00:30:55,259 --> 00:30:58,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, tell us about some hacking and cracking.

474
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,221
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some cool stuff coming out, actually, for the PSP that you can get.

475
00:31:02,102 --> 00:31:03,122
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them is actually this...

476
00:31:03,718 --> 00:31:07,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Group, that's a Spanish electronica group called the Overkillers.

477
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:12,941
[SPEAKER_04]: And they actually have a download, their whole music album is available now for a free PSP download.

478
00:31:13,181 --> 00:31:14,021
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of cool.

479
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:23,144
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can get that at, I would say it's probably better to go to PSPHackers.com and then find the link because the website's too long.

480
00:31:23,164 --> 00:31:27,725
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways, you can get it, it's like a good 63.6 meg download, so check it out.

481
00:31:28,385 --> 00:31:31,466
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some, obviously, they're going emulator crazy on...

482
00:31:32,469 --> 00:31:33,049
[SPEAKER_04]: The PSP, right?

483
00:31:33,069 --> 00:31:34,430
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I've noticed lately, too.

484
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:36,831
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen a lot of gaming blogs over on 1up.com.

485
00:31:36,871 --> 00:31:40,372
[SPEAKER_05]: People are posting pictures of their PSP emulated stuff.

486
00:31:40,392 --> 00:31:45,774
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm almost tempted to go get a 1.0 version PSP, one of the Japanese first ones.

487
00:31:46,914 --> 00:31:53,157
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, soon enough, once that 1.5, you know, once they crack that, it's going to be heaven, man.

488
00:31:53,397 --> 00:31:55,258
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have all the Game Boy Advance games.

489
00:31:55,638 --> 00:31:59,519
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually have Neo Geo emulated on that, and that's great.

490
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:01,740
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, definitely, if you've got a

491
00:32:02,273 --> 00:32:08,356
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're lucky enough to have one, the brand new version 1.01, definitely check all this stuff out.

492
00:32:08,396 --> 00:32:09,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Tons of fun stuff for that.

493
00:32:10,217 --> 00:32:22,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if you like more gadgety junk, they've got the PSP Shuffle, where this program you can download, and it'll actually put random content on your PSP, basically.

494
00:32:22,063 --> 00:32:23,444
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds kind of freaky.

495
00:32:23,624 --> 00:32:24,525
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of retarded.

496
00:32:24,545 --> 00:32:24,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

497
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:27,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Life is random.

498
00:32:27,892 --> 00:32:29,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would you have to buy this program?

499
00:32:29,152 --> 00:32:29,692
[SPEAKER_04]: That's retarded.

500
00:32:29,712 --> 00:32:34,453
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways, you can buy it if you want to, but honestly, save your time.

501
00:32:34,473 --> 00:32:35,914
[SPEAKER_04]: There are consumer whores out there.

502
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:40,455
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you want to be random, I'm never having a problem figuring out what I can put on my PSP.

503
00:32:40,475 --> 00:32:43,956
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to be random, put a dollar in an envelope and send it to me.

504
00:32:44,436 --> 00:32:45,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, that would be pretty random.

505
00:32:45,896 --> 00:32:47,497
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I would have money.

506
00:32:48,737 --> 00:32:50,538
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that's some cool stuff coming out.

507
00:32:50,598 --> 00:32:52,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I know that there's been some more stuff.

508
00:32:52,538 --> 00:32:55,119
[SPEAKER_04]: I was watching the whole

509
00:32:55,757 --> 00:32:59,641
[SPEAKER_04]: DS Linux, the whole thing going on with that.

510
00:32:59,741 --> 00:33:02,283
[SPEAKER_04]: And they actually have some progress on that, and it looks pretty cool.

511
00:33:02,944 --> 00:33:10,771
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got on themodgods.com, and it's a site that carries a bunch of information about, you know, just, you know, DS hacking.

512
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:14,054
[SPEAKER_04]: And they actually have DS, or DS... DS!

513
00:33:15,155 --> 00:33:15,756
[SPEAKER_04]: DS!

514
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotcha!

515
00:33:16,596 --> 00:33:19,259
[SPEAKER_04]: No, dshacker.com they actually released.

516
00:33:19,939 --> 00:33:21,080
[SPEAKER_04]: But they've got a whole thing...

517
00:33:22,113 --> 00:33:32,138
[SPEAKER_04]: They're showing pictures of, I believe it was actually on dshacker.com, pictures of the new version of Linux that's running on the DS.

518
00:33:32,198 --> 00:33:40,883
[SPEAKER_04]: And it actually has a picture of the Linux penguin with the Mario hat on it, which I thought was pretty cute.

519
00:33:42,724 --> 00:33:51,289
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's coming along pretty soon, and you'll be able to actually, you can actually download a copy of it, the Duelist 9 DS emulator.

520
00:33:53,007 --> 00:33:54,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's an emulator for DS.

521
00:33:54,128 --> 00:33:55,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, check that out too.

522
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,693
[SPEAKER_04]: A bunch of cool stuff.

523
00:33:58,754 --> 00:34:02,258
[SPEAKER_04]: And for my final thing to leave you guys with, actually two things.

524
00:34:02,705 --> 00:34:04,366
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

525
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:25,643
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S

526
00:34:55,189 --> 00:34:56,030
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple other things.

527
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,532
[SPEAKER_04]: The DS, more colors, pink and red.

528
00:34:58,712 --> 00:35:03,756
[SPEAKER_04]: So now you've got red that's going to be coming out for Jump Superstars, which, I don't know, is another game.

529
00:35:03,776 --> 00:35:04,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Not here in America?

530
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,017
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

531
00:35:05,057 --> 00:35:05,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Not in Japan.

532
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:10,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I need to import the graphite one, because the graphite one is all shiny black.

533
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:10,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

534
00:35:10,881 --> 00:35:19,648
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, those are going to be coming out, and definitely check out the brand new screens for the Linux, because it'll be awesome.

535
00:35:19,708 --> 00:35:20,068
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

536
00:35:20,268 --> 00:35:22,150
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, DarkSakura, I did say CGA.

537
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,791
[SPEAKER_05]: All its cyan...

538
00:35:24,318 --> 00:35:28,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Magenta, Black, and what's the other one I'm missing?

539
00:35:29,141 --> 00:35:29,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Yellow?

540
00:35:29,541 --> 00:35:30,102
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not Yellow.

541
00:35:30,822 --> 00:35:37,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, Cyan, Magenta, Black, and... No, Cyan, Magenta, Black, because C is Black.

542
00:35:37,786 --> 00:35:39,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

543
00:35:40,028 --> 00:35:40,368
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

544
00:35:40,508 --> 00:35:41,008
[SPEAKER_04]: It's four colors.

545
00:35:41,028 --> 00:35:42,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow.

546
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:44,511
[SPEAKER_05]: It was White, Black, Cyan, and Magenta.

547
00:35:44,531 --> 00:35:44,851
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

548
00:35:45,171 --> 00:35:45,951
[SPEAKER_04]: God, that's awful.

549
00:35:45,971 --> 00:35:47,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember Monochrome Green?

550
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:48,573
[SPEAKER_04]: How did we live?

551
00:35:48,933 --> 00:35:49,253
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

552
00:35:49,454 --> 00:35:49,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly.

553
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:51,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Oregon Trail, that's how we made it.

554
00:35:51,772 --> 00:35:53,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, a couple more stories.

555
00:35:53,534 --> 00:35:56,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about what's going on in some MMOs worlds right now.

556
00:35:56,679 --> 00:35:59,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Not technically an MMO, okay.

557
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Warcraft 3, more of a head-to-head game.

558
00:36:02,046 --> 00:36:02,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Blizzard...

559
00:36:03,493 --> 00:36:09,234
[SPEAKER_05]: closed over 53,000 Battle.net accounts on Warcraft 3.

560
00:36:10,594 --> 00:36:15,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, they were closed because they were hacking or cheating during a multiplayer session.

561
00:36:16,396 --> 00:36:19,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them were just banned for ladder play from a month.

562
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:20,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Some were permanently removed.

563
00:36:21,216 --> 00:36:21,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Crazy.

564
00:36:22,657 --> 00:36:25,877
[SPEAKER_05]: So, man, don't mess with those Battle.net.

565
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:29,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't mess with your games because they'll get you.

566
00:36:31,029 --> 00:36:37,473
[SPEAKER_05]: and one of the granddad, now this is as old school as MMOs get here, Ultima Online.

567
00:36:37,733 --> 00:36:39,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we know anybody that still plays Ultima Online?

568
00:36:39,934 --> 00:36:40,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

569
00:36:40,474 --> 00:36:42,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, I don't know anybody that still plays this, but that's cool.

570
00:36:43,556 --> 00:36:46,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Ultima Online is getting another expansion.

571
00:36:46,797 --> 00:36:49,159
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Mondaine's Legacy.

572
00:36:49,479 --> 00:36:51,500
[SPEAKER_05]: You know that game's been out for eight years now?

573
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Mondaine or Mundane?

574
00:36:54,301 --> 00:36:55,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Mondaine.

575
00:36:56,421 --> 00:36:56,741
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

576
00:36:57,002 --> 00:36:57,902
[SPEAKER_05]: You would think after eight years.

577
00:36:58,442 --> 00:37:00,343
[SPEAKER_05]: August 30th is the release of this game.

578
00:37:00,883 --> 00:37:03,725
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want a free trial of Ultima Online, see what you might be missing.

579
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:05,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't make fun until you've played it.

580
00:37:05,986 --> 00:37:06,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I have played it.

581
00:37:06,947 --> 00:37:07,507
[SPEAKER_05]: UO.com.

582
00:37:07,567 --> 00:37:09,708
[SPEAKER_02]: I still know people who are freaking playing Asheron's Call.

583
00:37:10,488 --> 00:37:10,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

584
00:37:10,888 --> 00:37:12,029
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not so surprising.

585
00:37:12,069 --> 00:37:12,910
[SPEAKER_02]: But Ultima Online.

586
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:19,053
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing I remember from Ultima Online is just because you can buy your own house.

587
00:37:19,093 --> 00:37:21,334
[SPEAKER_04]: People put their horses in the house so it wouldn't get stolen.

588
00:37:21,574 --> 00:37:21,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

589
00:37:22,352 --> 00:37:26,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Meimoto made a very interesting comment this week in an article on CNN Money.

590
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,517
[SPEAKER_05]: There need to be more quick play fun games.

591
00:38:04,795 --> 00:38:31,837
[SPEAKER_04]: but see the thing is with Grand Theft Auto though that is a quick play fun game same with Halo 2 actually because you can go and play multiplayer games it's fun Grand Theft Auto you don't even have to play the game you can just run around and exist in the world and it's fun and that's the whole point that's why I love that game that's why I can take Grand Theft Auto not play it for like a year and come back to it and still have fun in it and just be able to pick it right up again or even just be able to play it for weeks at a time because you can find little fun things to do in it

592
00:38:32,506 --> 00:38:33,427
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

593
00:39:03,328 --> 00:39:07,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo has always had, though, a family-oriented point of view.

594
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:17,975
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we have had the fair share of violent games, but for the most part, Nintendo has been, you know, they have brought out things that are kid-friendly, family-safe, you know, that type of thing.

595
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:24,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo only started getting a little more violent with that stuff, though, after they were publicly embarrassed with Mortal Kombat's sweat thing.

596
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:26,640
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that was the laughing stock at the time.

597
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:27,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

598
00:39:28,821 --> 00:39:33,145
[SPEAKER_02]: If you put in the blood code on Mortal Kombat 2, it would change some of the fatalities.

599
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:49,242
[SPEAKER_05]: on CNET, that the next generation consoles will kill off PC gaming.

600
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:50,183
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

601
00:39:50,203 --> 00:39:51,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on, hold on, hold on.

602
00:39:52,083 --> 00:40:01,507
[SPEAKER_05]: The bottom line is that console manufacturers often heavily subsidize their new machines, swallowing huge losses up front in hopes that they'll make it all back selling games.

603
00:40:04,788 --> 00:40:13,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is to say that once the 18-34 demographic starts buying $400 PS3s instead of $400 video cards, developers may have no choice but to follow suit.

604
00:40:14,491 --> 00:40:14,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Agree?

605
00:40:14,791 --> 00:40:15,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Disagree?

606
00:40:16,293 --> 00:40:23,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah, the PC market is still going to go... And honestly, I really think that the whole PC gaming market is going to be dominated by the MMO.

607
00:40:24,759 --> 00:40:33,767
[SPEAKER_02]: The more of them that come out, the more addicts there are going to be, and the more people who are going to upgrade their machine... Even I bought a new graphics card so I could play Final Fantasy XI.

608
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:37,630
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it makes PSO look so beautiful.

609
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,212
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, still...

610
00:40:42,118 --> 00:40:45,900
[SPEAKER_05]: You can already play Final Fantasy XI on a console, and then Xbox 360 is going to get it too.

611
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,021
[SPEAKER_02]: But it looks like shit on the console.

612
00:40:48,181 --> 00:40:50,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the Xbox 360 is going to be nice, you've got to give it that.

613
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:55,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but you can still always build a PC that's going to kick its ass.

614
00:40:56,844 --> 00:41:04,608
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think that as the consoles evolve, the PCs evolve too, so I think they'll always be a place for PC games.

615
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:05,628
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't know.

616
00:41:06,357 --> 00:41:26,677
[SPEAKER_02]: you pull your console out of the box six weeks later your computer technology is going to make it obsolete it's already obsolete you can build computers that use the cell structure processors they have them they've been having them they've been out for what a year now the cell processors

617
00:41:28,328 --> 00:41:33,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they've been marketing them for all kinds of science research.

618
00:41:33,651 --> 00:41:42,055
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what the article tries to say is that this kind of stuff is too expensive for most of us, but the game consoles make them affordable, I think, in a weird way.

619
00:41:42,075 --> 00:41:52,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, you buy the package deal, but there are still going to be the hardcore PC people who are going to keep it alive, and the fact that the pieces are so expensive, it's just more fuel.

620
00:41:53,194 --> 00:41:57,817
[SPEAKER_05]: and just right now, you can't play Xbox Live and be on IRC at the same time.

621
00:41:58,717 --> 00:41:58,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.

622
00:41:59,538 --> 00:42:02,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot do my homework playing PSO on the Xbox.

623
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:07,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, who's to say that that won't change in the future with what all these next-gen systems want to do, but I don't know.

624
00:42:07,463 --> 00:42:08,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, you have another thought on this?

625
00:42:08,503 --> 00:42:14,607
[SPEAKER_04]: It's never going to kill it off, because if you're spending $400 on a graphics card, you're a special kind of crazy anyway, so it's not going to matter.

626
00:42:15,171 --> 00:42:18,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, honestly, who spends $400 on a graphics card?

627
00:42:18,273 --> 00:42:23,096
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean... You know, if you're gonna spend that kind of money buying Alienware... Ooh, ooh, ooh, big man, buy a high-end graphics card.

628
00:42:23,136 --> 00:42:23,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess what?

629
00:42:23,616 --> 00:42:25,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Next week it's obsolete!

630
00:42:25,878 --> 00:42:29,000
[SPEAKER_04]: And my $20, you know, graphics card's still, you know, whatever.

631
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:33,122
[SPEAKER_04]: But the whole thing is, is you really don't need to spend all this money on console games.

632
00:42:33,203 --> 00:42:37,045
[SPEAKER_04]: People that are playing console games are gonna still be playing console games, and people that are playing the

633
00:42:37,831 --> 00:42:38,312
[SPEAKER_04]: PC games.

634
00:42:38,332 --> 00:42:44,961
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, because the PCs now, they're still going to get better, the graphics are going to get better, and it's still going to be one step ahead of the console systems.

635
00:42:44,981 --> 00:42:46,944
[SPEAKER_04]: The console systems will get closer, but whatever.

636
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:48,826
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd play all of them.

637
00:42:49,207 --> 00:42:49,607
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.

638
00:42:50,108 --> 00:42:50,568
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got them.

639
00:42:50,628 --> 00:42:50,969
[SPEAKER_02]: I play them.

640
00:42:52,073 --> 00:42:54,175
[SPEAKER_05]: But you're also a special kind of crazy, DarkSakura.

641
00:42:54,195 --> 00:42:55,816
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we love you.

642
00:42:56,136 --> 00:43:09,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, emulators are one thing, but I have to have the stupid half-broken joystick in my hand so I can play kicks on my Atari 5200 and play it right, goddammit.

643
00:43:09,926 --> 00:43:11,567
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

644
00:43:33,795 --> 00:43:34,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, very cool.

645
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:38,856
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely very first-person shooter-y, but they got them looking right.

646
00:43:39,336 --> 00:43:40,937
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, though, a bit of trivia.

647
00:43:41,777 --> 00:43:43,517
[SPEAKER_02]: You know Richard Dean Anderson was MacGyver.

648
00:43:44,758 --> 00:43:45,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

649
00:43:45,298 --> 00:43:45,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

650
00:43:46,078 --> 00:43:50,699
[SPEAKER_02]: But dude was also in a few episodes of MacGyver, too.

651
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:54,800
[SPEAKER_05]: July is the release date for that game, so you kids look for it.

652
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,581
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to bring another edition of Orange Lounge Radio to go to a close.

653
00:43:58,641 --> 00:43:59,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Final thoughts, Loki?

654
00:44:00,841 --> 00:44:02,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I have my headache still.

655
00:44:02,543 --> 00:44:03,544
[SPEAKER_04]: It needs to go away.

656
00:44:04,585 --> 00:44:07,207
[SPEAKER_04]: And I loaned out Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

657
00:44:07,287 --> 00:44:08,148
[SPEAKER_04]: What was I thinking?

658
00:44:09,589 --> 00:44:10,109
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

659
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:13,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Reject false icons and happy birthday to the old man.

660
00:44:16,415 --> 00:44:21,459
[SPEAKER_05]: And my final thought is my birthday is coming up very soon and I hope you're all going to get me something lovely.

661
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,301
[SPEAKER_04]: My second final thought is

662
00:44:24,585 --> 00:44:28,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Vote for us on Podcast Alley.

663
00:44:29,247 --> 00:44:31,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Go there now.

664
00:44:32,049 --> 00:44:33,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't hesitate.

665
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:33,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Go there now.

666
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:35,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you vote us, we get better.

667
00:44:36,191 --> 00:44:38,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you feel like it's running for student council, though?

668
00:44:38,892 --> 00:44:39,593
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

669
00:44:39,613 --> 00:44:44,735
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to vote for us so that my ego can inflate to astronomical proportions.

670
00:44:44,835 --> 00:44:45,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Need to go now.

671
00:44:45,475 --> 00:44:46,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Podcast Alley.

672
00:44:47,003 --> 00:44:48,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, go vote for us.

673
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:48,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it.

674
00:44:48,863 --> 00:44:49,204
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

675
00:44:49,324 --> 00:44:50,084
[SPEAKER_04]: And vote every month.

676
00:44:50,124 --> 00:44:50,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't just vote once.

677
00:44:51,044 --> 00:44:51,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Vote every month.

678
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:54,825
[SPEAKER_02]: I, your favorite internet celebrity, beseeches you.

679
00:44:56,005 --> 00:44:56,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Vote!

680
00:44:57,445 --> 00:44:57,846
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

681
00:44:57,866 --> 00:44:58,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Vote or die.

682
00:44:58,746 --> 00:44:59,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Vote or die!

683
00:44:59,486 --> 00:45:03,307
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just going to say, as P. Diddy says, vote or die.

684
00:45:04,447 --> 00:45:04,847
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

685
00:45:04,867 --> 00:45:05,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one, you guys.

686
00:45:05,987 --> 00:45:08,188
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see you next time on the Orange Lounge Radio Deco Edition.

687
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:13,165
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

688
00:45:13,485 --> 00:45:19,033
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com.

689
00:45:19,474 --> 00:45:20,475
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next update.
