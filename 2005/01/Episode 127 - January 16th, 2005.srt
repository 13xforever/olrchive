[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, you need to shut up.

27
00:03:41,786 --> 00:03:43,727
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, I'm kidding.

28
00:03:44,227 --> 00:03:49,590
[SPEAKER_16]: I had... I resisted temptation, which everyone's going to hear about later.

29
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,451
[SPEAKER_16]: But everybody needs to be proud of me.

[SPEAKER_16]: When are you going to join the Olympic team?

34
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,431
[SPEAKER_03]: When they make DDR an Olympic sport.

35
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:05,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.

36
00:04:05,191 --> 00:04:05,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.

37
00:04:05,991 --> 00:04:07,432
[SPEAKER_03]: When's DDR going to be in the Olympics?

38
00:04:07,492 --> 00:04:07,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.

39
00:04:07,892 --> 00:04:08,272
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

40
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:10,153
[SPEAKER_16]: Jumping on a trampoline is an Olympic sport.

41
00:04:10,253 --> 00:04:10,833
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh my God.

42
00:04:12,573 --> 00:04:15,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, don't knock the trampoline, okay?

43
00:04:15,134 --> 00:04:16,735
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't, but I still think it's funny.

44
00:04:16,815 --> 00:04:18,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Trampoline is fucking rad.

45
00:04:19,116 --> 00:04:25,918
[SPEAKER_03]: I was actually like looking into wanting to join like a trampoline class because they were showing it on the news and everything when the Olympics were around.

46
00:04:25,938 --> 00:04:27,859
[SPEAKER_16]: That's like taking bowling for college credit.

47
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:29,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I did that.

48
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,180
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm kidding.

49
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:31,440
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't.

50
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:31,640
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't.

51
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:39,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, also joining us tonight, I actually looked into the bowling class, I'll tell the bowling story later.

52
00:04:40,543 --> 00:04:45,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Also joining us tonight, say hello to the Tech Massa, with a Massa plan, Loki.

53
00:04:47,686 --> 00:04:48,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, hi.

54
00:04:51,127 --> 00:04:56,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Who has one of those looks of, I don't know what to do tonight, these people are very strange.

55
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Also joining us,

56
00:04:59,631 --> 00:05:02,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello to our very special guest this evening.

57
00:05:02,112 --> 00:05:04,313
[SPEAKER_03]: He's also special, just like DarkSakura.

58
00:05:05,114 --> 00:05:06,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello to Arcadian42.

59
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,655
[SPEAKER_17]: Is this a non-credible mic?

60
00:05:08,995 --> 00:05:12,557
[SPEAKER_17]: Or is it a new non-credible mic?

61
00:05:13,537 --> 00:05:16,059
[SPEAKER_03]: That microphone actually works, but it's kind of quiet.

62
00:05:16,499 --> 00:05:20,941
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're kind of quiet, so you're really going to have to try tonight.

63
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:21,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen in!

64
00:05:26,055 --> 00:05:30,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you don't have to yell out there to listen in, because obviously they're already listening, right?

65
00:05:30,499 --> 00:05:30,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

66
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:32,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

67
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:34,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

68
00:05:34,882 --> 00:05:36,924
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, maybe I'll help them to listen a little closer.

69
00:05:38,985 --> 00:05:39,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Come really close.

70
00:05:40,146 --> 00:05:40,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Come really close.

71
00:05:40,987 --> 00:05:41,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Come close to me for a minute.

72
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:43,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Come close to the speakers.

73
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:44,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Boo!

74
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:53,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yeah, anyway, we got tons of interesting stuff to talk about tonight, or at least in theory we do.

75
00:05:54,598 --> 00:05:54,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

76
00:05:57,078 --> 00:06:00,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Just keep thinking this show is good, and then it will be good.

77
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:03,780
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be interesting because it's somewhat of a slow news week.

78
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,480
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have a couple big things we want to talk about.

79
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,041
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do that.

80
00:06:07,381 --> 00:06:11,602
[SPEAKER_03]: All the favorite usual garbage you're used to, we're going to talk about that when we come back from this break.

81
00:06:12,322 --> 00:06:19,344
[SPEAKER_03]: In this break, we're going to do some music from Dancing Stage Fusion, which is the Europe DDR that just came out a couple months ago.

82
00:06:19,364 --> 00:06:21,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it was more than a couple months ago, but end of last year.

83
00:06:22,426 --> 00:06:27,989
[SPEAKER_03]: But they got some cool licenses in their version of DDR, and you're not going to believe some of the stuff you're going to hear in this break.

84
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,630
[SPEAKER_03]: It is all in the British DDR.

85
00:06:30,091 --> 00:06:36,935
[SPEAKER_03]: So enjoy this, and we will be back after this with more of the same old crap you know and love here at Orange Lounge Radio.

86
00:06:37,295 --> 00:06:40,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Join our chat, www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat.

87
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:43,979
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back after this, starting it off with DJ Sammy.

88
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,141
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not Heaven, the other song.

89
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:46,581
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back.

90
00:07:00,325 --> 00:07:04,208
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

91
00:07:43,854 --> 00:07:45,055
Thank you for watching!

92
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:17,123
[SPEAKER_13]: Fire in the disco Fire in the Taco Bell Fire in the disco

93
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:39,441
[SPEAKER_13]: Fire in the gates of hell Don't you wanna know how we keep starting fires?

94
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:46,223
[SPEAKER_13]: It's my desire It's my desire It's my desire Don't you wanna know how we keep starting fires?

95
00:10:46,283 --> 00:10:54,385
[SPEAKER_13]: It's my desire It's my desire It's my desire Danger, danger High voltage When we touch When we kill Danger, danger

96
00:11:03,738 --> 00:11:13,643
[SPEAKER_13]: High voltage, when we touch, when we kiss, when we touch Danger, danger, high voltage, when we touch, when we kiss Danger, danger, high voltage, when we touch, when we kiss

97
00:11:41,854 --> 00:11:45,161
[SPEAKER_13]: Tell me, is life just a playground?

98
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:50,973
[SPEAKER_14]: Think you're the real deal, honey And someone will always look out for you

99
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:24,804
[SPEAKER_21]: Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

100
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:36,196
[SPEAKER_03]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and in that break you heard some songs from Dancing Stage Fusion.

101
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:38,318
[SPEAKER_03]: To give you an idea, if you didn't know what some of those songs were...

102
00:13:38,778 --> 00:13:48,950
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Sammy with Sunlight, Kylie Minogue coming to my world, Electric Six with Danger High Voltage, also known as the Taco Bell song, and Basement Jacks, Good Luck.

103
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,992
[SPEAKER_03]: All of those are songs that are really cool.

104
00:13:51,172 --> 00:13:53,455
[SPEAKER_16]: We played that song in my spin class.

105
00:13:54,797 --> 00:13:56,939
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I introduced my spin teacher to Good Luck.

106
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't that a former cage match pick of yours, too?

107
00:13:59,682 --> 00:13:59,982
[SPEAKER_03]: It was.

108
00:14:00,102 --> 00:14:02,344
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was also in the Queer Eye soundtrack.

109
00:14:02,544 --> 00:14:03,825
[SPEAKER_03]: And look, it ended up in DDR.

110
00:14:04,185 --> 00:14:06,586
[SPEAKER_16]: And Kylie Minogue... I am so damn talented!

111
00:14:07,007 --> 00:14:10,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Kylie Minogue, coming to my world, was once in the Orange Lounge Cage Match.

112
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Ended up in DDR.

113
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:12,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.

114
00:14:13,851 --> 00:14:16,892
[SPEAKER_03]: So people don't think we know what we're talking about, but, you know, shit.

115
00:14:17,213 --> 00:14:21,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Just cross your fingers that Girls by Prodigy will not end up in DDR.

116
00:14:24,517 --> 00:14:24,917
[SPEAKER_24]: It will.

117
00:14:26,018 --> 00:14:26,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

118
00:14:27,219 --> 00:14:27,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway...

119
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:29,216
[SPEAKER_03]: and David Hasselhoff

120
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:55,677
[SPEAKER_03]: We did get some good stuff, but I would have rather had that.

121
00:14:56,057 --> 00:15:02,561
[SPEAKER_03]: And it kind of sucks because it's really hard to import the Europe DDR because you have to get one of those converters for your TV as well.

122
00:15:02,921 --> 00:15:04,301
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easy to import Japanese.

123
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:08,964
[SPEAKER_03]: You just get a Japanese PlayStation 2, get the Japanese game, and the TVs are the same format.

124
00:15:09,424 --> 00:15:12,446
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you want to do the Europe, the TVs are in a different format.

125
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,247
[SPEAKER_03]: The screens are actually a different resolution over there.

126
00:15:16,187 --> 00:15:19,089
[SPEAKER_24]: Stupid Europe and their base 10 measurement systems.

127
00:15:21,326 --> 00:15:24,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Stupid metric system and everything being easy math.

128
00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:26,451
[SPEAKER_16]: Like the rest of the world uses.

129
00:15:26,571 --> 00:15:27,072
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello?

130
00:15:28,753 --> 00:15:29,434
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I know.

131
00:15:30,435 --> 00:15:30,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

132
00:15:31,516 --> 00:15:33,578
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking at the comments in our chat room.

133
00:15:33,778 --> 00:15:35,640
[SPEAKER_03]: www.orangenautoradio.com, click on chat.

134
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:41,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Jaded2005 says, Girls would probably end up in DDR as Konami's way to shaft us again.

135
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,040
[SPEAKER_16]: I would cry.

136
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:50,204
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to write a letter to Jason Enos myself and request that girls be put in the next DDR.

137
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,207
[SPEAKER_03]: As much as that song bugs me, I just think that would be funny.

138
00:15:55,228 --> 00:15:57,690
[SPEAKER_24]: A very strange video.

139
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:01,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Prodigy was famous for that one video, the Smack My Bitch Up video.

140
00:16:01,212 --> 00:16:01,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it just as good?

141
00:16:02,313 --> 00:16:04,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the Smack My Bitch Up video was just, wow.

142
00:16:05,115 --> 00:16:13,902
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, this obviously doesn't help for the people at home, but I have... It was an edited version of the video for the first remix of Girls I Submitted to the Cage Match.

143
00:16:15,005 --> 00:16:16,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Um... It's a really bad one.

144
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:17,606
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, whatever.

145
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:28,770
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, anyways, um... So, just to give you an idea, I mean, this obviously is not going through to listeners, but it's just really very strange.

146
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:35,673
[SPEAKER_24]: They've got, like, some person that looks like a kid with, like, some army costume and a floating head, giant lips talking.

147
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,934
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got, like, the Rocky Horror lips mixed with Max Headroom.

148
00:16:39,414 --> 00:16:43,836
[SPEAKER_03]: They do, like, the Rocky Horror lips with White Wolf RPGs.

149
00:16:44,272 --> 00:16:50,094
[SPEAKER_24]: And then it just gets even stranger with this thing moving around and giant lips watching it.

150
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:55,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, the chatroom can't see it, but where could they maybe get a copy of it?

151
00:16:55,775 --> 00:16:57,016
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you got this from somewhere, right?

152
00:16:58,276 --> 00:17:02,757
[SPEAKER_24]: I believe this was on the... Oh, God, who was that?

153
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:05,878
[SPEAKER_24]: It was the group that remixed it.

154
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:10,159
[SPEAKER_24]: Let me see here.

155
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,720
[SPEAKER_24]: I believe it was...

156
00:17:12,694 --> 00:17:14,616
[SPEAKER_24]: The fake ID's website.

157
00:17:15,636 --> 00:17:16,797
[SPEAKER_24]: Fake ID is the band name.

158
00:17:17,398 --> 00:17:20,420
[SPEAKER_24]: And there's a link in their download section to the video.

159
00:17:21,881 --> 00:17:26,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so if you want to check out random 80's flashback to a cruddy song, enjoy.

160
00:17:28,427 --> 00:17:29,828
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, shut up.

161
00:17:31,109 --> 00:17:32,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'll change the topic.

162
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:33,891
[SPEAKER_24]: Or else I'll put in another version.

163
00:17:34,051 --> 00:17:35,012
[SPEAKER_24]: I've got two more.

164
00:17:35,432 --> 00:17:36,813
[SPEAKER_24]: They will go in the cage match.

165
00:17:38,415 --> 00:17:41,137
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be Loki's threat all night long.

166
00:17:41,716 --> 00:17:44,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't piss me off or I swear to God I'll do it again.

167
00:17:45,358 --> 00:17:45,939
[SPEAKER_03]: I dare you.

168
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:46,940
[SPEAKER_16]: I double dog dare you.

169
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,521
[SPEAKER_03]: The chat room's very divided there.

170
00:17:48,881 --> 00:17:50,162
[SPEAKER_16]: I triple dog dare you.

171
00:17:50,222 --> 00:17:51,362
[SPEAKER_03]: The chat room's very divided.

172
00:17:51,422 --> 00:17:52,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Some are yelling at you to do it.

173
00:17:52,643 --> 00:17:55,065
[SPEAKER_16]: I quadruple two-headed dog dare you.

174
00:17:57,787 --> 00:17:58,047
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

175
00:17:58,307 --> 00:18:02,710
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get into How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, but we did have a newcomer join us during the break there.

176
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:06,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Not much of a newcomer because she's been at this show a gazillion million times.

177
00:18:06,773 --> 00:18:07,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello to DDR Angel.

178
00:18:08,334 --> 00:18:08,534
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello.

179
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:08,674
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello.

180
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,511
[SPEAKER_03]: and why are you tardy, ma'am?

181
00:18:12,851 --> 00:18:14,672
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, traffic and stuff.

182
00:18:15,312 --> 00:18:16,132
[SPEAKER_03]: That's no excuse.

183
00:18:16,152 --> 00:18:17,092
[SPEAKER_03]: You should have left earlier.

184
00:18:17,132 --> 00:18:18,673
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to mark that down as tardy.

185
00:18:19,173 --> 00:18:19,573
[SPEAKER_16]: FIRED!

186
00:18:20,593 --> 00:18:21,194
[SPEAKER_16]: I am not.

187
00:18:21,654 --> 00:18:22,734
[SPEAKER_16]: You lie so bad.

188
00:18:24,214 --> 00:18:25,815
[SPEAKER_03]: She just, she knows she can get away with it.

189
00:18:26,075 --> 00:18:27,796
[SPEAKER_16]: Besides, I brought you something.

190
00:18:27,876 --> 00:18:30,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, she brought me, okay, gifts make it better.

191
00:18:30,116 --> 00:18:30,496
[SPEAKER_03]: What'd you bring me?

192
00:18:30,516 --> 00:18:30,897
[SPEAKER_03]: What'd you bring me?

193
00:18:30,917 --> 00:18:31,837
[SPEAKER_03]: What'd you bring me?

194
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,078
[SPEAKER_03]: All is forgiven because I got free stuff.

195
00:18:37,218 --> 00:18:37,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, soda.

196
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:38,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, what is this?

197
00:18:39,778 --> 00:18:41,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Diet Cherry Vanilla Dr. Pepper?

198
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:42,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Ew!

199
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:44,259
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never heard of this.

200
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:44,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Ew!

201
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,840
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gross.

202
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,640
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds interesting.

203
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I will be the judge of that.

204
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:49,301
[SPEAKER_16]: It is foul.

205
00:18:49,781 --> 00:18:51,101
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be the judge of that, Ms.

206
00:18:51,141 --> 00:18:51,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Thing.

207
00:18:51,622 --> 00:18:52,742
[SPEAKER_16]: I had it in Alabama.

208
00:18:54,162 --> 00:18:56,923
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, okay.

209
00:18:57,043 --> 00:18:58,223
[SPEAKER_16]: I had this in November.

210
00:18:58,724 --> 00:19:03,985
[SPEAKER_16]: When I went to Alabama, I was like, oh, that looks neat and interesting, and the commercials are on the radio all the goddamn time.

211
00:19:04,345 --> 00:19:05,226
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I'll try one.

212
00:19:05,526 --> 00:19:06,526
[SPEAKER_16]: I had three sips of it.

213
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:10,730
[SPEAKER_16]: I gave the rest of it to a homeless person.

214
00:19:13,412 --> 00:19:14,052
[SPEAKER_16]: He threw it away.

215
00:19:16,534 --> 00:19:17,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait a minute.

216
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:19,776
[SPEAKER_04]: You gave your soda to a homeless person?

217
00:19:19,796 --> 00:19:20,216
[SPEAKER_04]: How does that work?

218
00:19:20,236 --> 00:19:21,257
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I don't know if he was a homeless person.

219
00:19:21,277 --> 00:19:22,137
[SPEAKER_16]: He looked like a beach bum.

220
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:23,738
[SPEAKER_16]: He was out Pensacola.

221
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:26,200
[SPEAKER_24]: Loki, comment.

222
00:19:28,361 --> 00:19:31,823
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, because, you know, I always like taking shitty soda and adding shit to it.

223
00:19:32,103 --> 00:19:36,106
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, this soda would be just all that better if I put vanilla and cherry in it.

224
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:39,004
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't like Dr. Pepper anyway, so... They've had this...

225
00:19:49,184 --> 00:19:50,925
[SPEAKER_16]: at least in the southeast for a while now.

226
00:19:51,165 --> 00:19:55,467
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go over to the webcam and sample the Diet Cherry Vanilla Dr. Pepper.

227
00:19:55,808 --> 00:19:56,648
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll have the barf bag ready.

228
00:19:56,668 --> 00:19:58,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Webcam's over at www.warnersonsradio.com.

229
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:06,934
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime, since I can't expect everybody to be looking at the webcam, we'll start off our show as we always do, playing a little bit of How was your week?

230
00:20:06,974 --> 00:20:07,734
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your day?

231
00:20:08,315 --> 00:20:11,997
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jamie's going to start us off, as always, by letting us know, How was your week?

232
00:20:12,437 --> 00:20:12,877
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your day?

233
00:20:13,557 --> 00:20:18,040
[SPEAKER_16]: My week was sick, as in I've had this cough that hasn't wanted to go away.

234
00:20:22,497 --> 00:20:25,438
[SPEAKER_16]: and Holiday Spice Pasty is just as nasty.

235
00:20:28,639 --> 00:20:36,621
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, it was my last week over in the student loan industry.

236
00:20:37,101 --> 00:20:38,121
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank God!

237
00:20:38,642 --> 00:20:42,503
[SPEAKER_16]: And I swear the VP was kissing my ass the whole time trying to get me to stay.

238
00:20:43,183 --> 00:20:45,123
[SPEAKER_16]: And my boss took me out to eat.

239
00:20:45,863 --> 00:20:46,704
[SPEAKER_16]: And oh, this is funny.

240
00:20:47,864 --> 00:20:48,284
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you think?

241
00:20:51,856 --> 00:20:57,819
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't take a very big sip because the chat room just told us that the webcam isn't up still, so we're going to turn it on right now, and I'll take another sip.

242
00:21:01,401 --> 00:21:08,724
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, it was kind of a really messed up, sad week.

243
00:21:08,784 --> 00:21:10,084
[SPEAKER_16]: It was a very frustrating week.

244
00:21:11,585 --> 00:21:17,188
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just didn't have the energy to do much of anything, although I tried step aerobics and I didn't care for it.

245
00:21:18,588 --> 00:21:19,789
[SPEAKER_16]: That was my new thing that I did.

246
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:25,973
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, although Friday I took the day off and, uh, oh, here we go.

247
00:21:26,913 --> 00:21:29,796
[SPEAKER_16]: But, uh, Friday I took the day off and went to the Skywalker Ranch.

248
00:21:30,136 --> 00:21:38,642
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I have a friend that works for LucasArts and she got us into the Skywalker Ranch and so we were gonna go, uh-oh, I'll wait, I have to see this.

249
00:21:39,302 --> 00:21:39,943
[SPEAKER_16]: Take your drink.

250
00:21:40,943 --> 00:21:41,444
[SPEAKER_16]: Suffer!

251
00:21:41,464 --> 00:21:45,647
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh-oh.

252
00:21:53,058 --> 00:21:58,761
[SPEAKER_03]: It really just tastes like regular Dr. Pepper to me with like a funny flavor to it.

253
00:21:58,941 --> 00:22:00,042
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't explain it.

254
00:22:00,122 --> 00:22:01,162
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not cherry or vanilla.

255
00:22:01,202 --> 00:22:03,143
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just hilarity.

256
00:22:03,383 --> 00:22:06,325
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Dr. Pepper flavored with hilarity.

257
00:22:07,906 --> 00:22:16,690
[SPEAKER_24]: And the aftertaste is... Mmm, Dr. Pepper vaginal juice mix.

258
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,092
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, I went to the Skywalker Ranch.

259
00:22:20,112 --> 00:22:20,312
[SPEAKER_24]: Disgusting.

260
00:22:21,195 --> 00:22:22,977
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

261
00:22:43,169 --> 00:22:47,132
[SPEAKER_16]: Speaking of altering Star Wars, we're sitting there at our table eating.

262
00:22:47,713 --> 00:22:55,079
[SPEAKER_16]: All of a sudden, guess who walks by behind us but George Lucas himself and the business associate discussing things.

263
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:56,960
[SPEAKER_23]: I hope you flick your mashed potatoes at him.

264
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:57,961
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't eat mashed potatoes.

265
00:22:58,762 --> 00:23:02,805
[SPEAKER_16]: I really wanted to flick my meatloaf at him but the meatloaf was really good and I didn't want to ruin it.

266
00:23:03,686 --> 00:23:04,847
[SPEAKER_23]: You might have gotten kicked out too.

267
00:23:05,167 --> 00:23:05,407
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

268
00:23:05,587 --> 00:23:06,388
[SPEAKER_23]: But it would have been worth it.

269
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:09,931
[SPEAKER_16]: But we next went and raided the employee store.

270
00:23:10,811 --> 00:23:12,653
[SPEAKER_16]: So I actually have an episode 3 hoodie.

271
00:23:13,444 --> 00:23:19,108
[SPEAKER_16]: Just because I really wanted a hoodie, and I figured Episode 3 hoodie, nobody else has one unless they work there, so hey, cool.

272
00:23:19,188 --> 00:23:20,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're special.

273
00:23:20,469 --> 00:23:22,370
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I just figured it was an opportunity.

274
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:25,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I know you don't like to go on cam, but can we model your hoodie?

275
00:23:26,213 --> 00:23:26,953
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I suppose.

276
00:23:27,634 --> 00:23:28,915
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll model your hoodie.

277
00:23:29,015 --> 00:23:30,135
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, model my hoodie.

278
00:23:31,516 --> 00:23:36,900
[SPEAKER_16]: I also got an ILM shirt, and on the back it says Visual Arts Crew, which I thought was really nifty.

279
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:40,322
[SPEAKER_16]: Better watch out, it smells like me.

280
00:23:40,342 --> 00:23:42,704
[SPEAKER_16]: It smells like camo, which is what I'm really wearing.

281
00:23:47,165 --> 00:23:47,905
[SPEAKER_16]: It's upside down, Rob.

282
00:23:49,006 --> 00:23:49,546
[SPEAKER_16]: And backwards.

283
00:23:50,607 --> 00:23:52,268
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, you're just infinitely amusing.

284
00:23:56,751 --> 00:23:58,972
[SPEAKER_16]: Hold the hood back and hold it out by the shoulders.

285
00:23:58,992 --> 00:23:59,372
[SPEAKER_16]: There you go.

286
00:24:01,093 --> 00:24:02,114
[SPEAKER_16]: See, I'm cool.

287
00:24:03,895 --> 00:24:10,559
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, we also, I got a really nice leather business folder for Dan.

288
00:24:11,226 --> 00:24:29,141
[SPEAKER_16]: and we actually got everything, all this expensive shit at half price because one of our friends, because our friend was of course with us and I also had a latte made by a $10,000 latte machine and it was like a really damn good latte too it was like professional and shit, it was really yummy

289
00:24:31,045 --> 00:24:36,426
[SPEAKER_16]: and so we sat in this sort of lounge area enjoying our latte.

290
00:24:36,446 --> 00:24:39,327
[SPEAKER_16]: They had a bunch of old Star Wars and Indiana Jones toys in there.

291
00:24:39,347 --> 00:24:40,007
[SPEAKER_16]: Cool.

292
00:24:40,047 --> 00:24:41,987
[SPEAKER_16]: Because we went by the marketing director's office.

293
00:24:42,908 --> 00:24:44,348
[SPEAKER_16]: The licensing director, that was it.

294
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,869
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to clarify, the food was better than episode one?

295
00:24:49,129 --> 00:24:50,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, incredibly.

296
00:24:50,649 --> 00:24:51,670
[SPEAKER_16]: The food was excellent.

297
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,970
[SPEAKER_16]: The movie was not.

298
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:57,991
[SPEAKER_16]: We sort of were too stunned to go mob the man and say...

299
00:24:58,345 --> 00:25:01,288
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, Jorge, what was wrong with your head?

300
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:09,676
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was funny, we were talking to a couple of the receptionists there, just, you know, seeing who all they've met and everything.

301
00:25:09,696 --> 00:25:11,517
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like, oh, a George sighting!

302
00:25:12,658 --> 00:25:13,799
[SPEAKER_16]: So it was kind of funny.

303
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:19,825
[SPEAKER_24]: Nothing beats watching a really shitty Star Wars movie that's been bootlegged with really shitty subtitles.

304
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:23,989
[SPEAKER_24]: Like, for instance, you know, lines like, You'll be the desert of me.

305
00:25:24,562 --> 00:25:52,963
[SPEAKER_16]: Or Sup, Yoda That's funny Sup, Yoda But, you know, after that we took a trip to Network Video Because our friend still had to work And at Network Video we made some purchases We bought Saturn AV cables We bought Street Fighter Alpha for the US Saturn Because we didn't have it, believe it or not I have to ask

306
00:25:53,823 --> 00:25:56,465
[SPEAKER_03]: How many times do you actually play these games after you buy them?

307
00:25:57,206 --> 00:25:57,806
[SPEAKER_16]: I play them.

308
00:25:58,106 --> 00:25:59,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

309
00:25:59,127 --> 00:26:01,389
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, I also bought a Japanese game for the GameCube.

310
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:02,830
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, what game?

311
00:26:03,171 --> 00:26:06,053
[SPEAKER_16]: Dobutsu no Mori, which was Animal Crossing in the U.S.

312
00:26:06,593 --> 00:26:06,733
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh!

313
00:26:06,914 --> 00:26:11,858
[SPEAKER_16]: And the whole reason I was basically peeing in my pants the whole time watching this game was because...

314
00:26:14,483 --> 00:26:16,025
[SPEAKER_16]: I thought, because you know in the U.S.

315
00:26:16,245 --> 00:26:20,091
[SPEAKER_16]: one, it says each individual letter when they're talking.

316
00:26:20,772 --> 00:26:25,438
[SPEAKER_16]: But people usually go through it, and I was like, okay, well, you can't really understand the letters.

317
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:26,600
[SPEAKER_16]: And...

318
00:26:28,584 --> 00:26:32,007
[SPEAKER_16]: On some movie files, I had people playing the Japanese version.

319
00:26:32,027 --> 00:26:36,792
[SPEAKER_16]: I thought they were just speeding through it because they were saying it all so fast, but I could tell that they were saying each of the kana.

320
00:26:37,432 --> 00:26:44,419
[SPEAKER_16]: So I thought, well, maybe if I let it go slow, I'll hear what they're saying and can use it as practice for, you know, my comprehension.

321
00:26:44,659 --> 00:26:48,883
[SPEAKER_16]: Because that was the whole reason I won it, is because all of the text in the game is in hiragana.

322
00:26:49,784 --> 00:26:52,226
[SPEAKER_16]: So, yeah, I don't have to worry about reading any kanji because, like,

323
00:26:52,626 --> 00:26:54,748
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the 30 kanji I know is in the title.

324
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,531
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

325
00:27:38,813 --> 00:27:40,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Go find a homeless person and give them a Nintendo 64.

326
00:27:40,754 --> 00:27:42,795
[SPEAKER_16]: The fuck am I going to do with this?

327
00:27:49,633 --> 00:27:53,495
[SPEAKER_16]: I put it in, and to my disappointment, they spoke just as fast as it did in the thing.

328
00:27:53,536 --> 00:27:57,558
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's actually neat because I like how you enter your text.

329
00:27:58,178 --> 00:28:02,721
[SPEAKER_16]: Instead of having to go to that little screen where you choose your letters, instead you use your analog pad.

330
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:11,326
[SPEAKER_16]: Because the quote alphabet is done in a series of, like, you have five in each group.

331
00:28:11,746 --> 00:28:15,508
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, I, U, A, O, Ma, Mi, Mu, Me, Mo, Sa, Shi, Tu, Te, To, like that.

332
00:28:16,244 --> 00:28:41,876
[SPEAKER_16]: A, I, U, Me, Mo But the way that you do is you pick each of the first ones in the group The A sound like you could pick the A group or Ma group or Sa group, like that And then you choose that on your analog pad And then it pulls up all of the ones in that one So you choose everything with your analog pad It's very, very smart Very cool It wouldn't work for English, of course, which is probably why they changed it But it makes it a lot easier

333
00:28:42,481 --> 00:28:44,823
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so looking forward to Animal Crossing on the DS, though.

334
00:28:44,983 --> 00:28:47,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, so am I. So am I. Happy thoughts.

335
00:28:48,565 --> 00:28:52,688
[SPEAKER_16]: But also, I'm looking forward to actually being able to play Zelda and Mario without having a code.

336
00:28:54,389 --> 00:28:56,350
[SPEAKER_16]: Because they were just, you could dig them up in the dirt.

337
00:28:57,851 --> 00:29:01,414
[SPEAKER_16]: But, um, I figured it'll help me with my learning.

338
00:29:02,114 --> 00:29:08,498
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, and I did a pretty decent job reading it through, uh, through, uh, with, uh, what was his face?

339
00:29:08,899 --> 00:29:10,200
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't believe I forgot his name.

340
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,881
[SPEAKER_16]: But, um, the dog.

341
00:29:11,901 --> 00:29:12,101
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

342
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, KK.

343
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:17,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Tom Nook?

344
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:19,781
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I'm trying to remember his actual name.

345
00:29:20,102 --> 00:29:20,502
[SPEAKER_16]: Toto KK.

346
00:29:20,562 --> 00:29:21,382
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, okay.

347
00:29:21,402 --> 00:29:21,622
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

348
00:29:21,662 --> 00:29:23,542
[SPEAKER_16]: Toto KK.

349
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,443
[SPEAKER_16]: But I had a pretty good time with that.

350
00:29:26,483 --> 00:29:33,905
[SPEAKER_16]: And then yesterday, I went over to Iguana Girls House, and we played lots of 8-style and lots of Poppin' 9.

351
00:29:34,805 --> 00:29:37,426
[SPEAKER_16]: I have to thank Raichan for selling me her Poppin' 9.

352
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:38,566
[SPEAKER_16]: And, uh...

353
00:29:39,481 --> 00:29:44,664
[SPEAKER_16]: and Navi for selling me his controller, which still works beautifully, I might add.

354
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:44,964
[SPEAKER_16]: Good.

355
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:50,827
[SPEAKER_16]: And my five-year-old 2DX controller still functions as perfectly as when I opened the box.

356
00:29:50,847 --> 00:29:51,688
[SPEAKER_03]: You lucky bitch.

357
00:29:52,308 --> 00:29:54,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we actually... Mine is broke as hell.

358
00:29:54,089 --> 00:29:55,610
[SPEAKER_16]: We've only cleaned it out twice.

359
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,331
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to clean mine out like five times and still it was on.

360
00:29:58,351 --> 00:30:01,313
[SPEAKER_16]: But this last time we actually took it out and actually cleaned the circuit board.

361
00:30:02,494 --> 00:30:04,675
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was, it's almost flawless now.

362
00:30:04,695 --> 00:30:05,835
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, you can tell it's kind of old.

363
00:30:06,376 --> 00:30:07,777
[SPEAKER_16]: But we played lots of 8th style.

364
00:30:07,817 --> 00:30:08,437
[SPEAKER_16]: It was pretty fun.

365
00:30:09,076 --> 00:30:13,960
[SPEAKER_16]: and then we had Musical Night where we watched Little Shop of Horrors and Chicago.

366
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,561
[SPEAKER_16]: Didn't you guys go see Phantom?

367
00:30:15,821 --> 00:30:16,302
[SPEAKER_16]: No, we didn't.

368
00:30:16,782 --> 00:30:18,103
[SPEAKER_16]: But I'm going to go see it tomorrow with Tia.

369
00:30:18,303 --> 00:30:19,564
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

370
00:30:20,405 --> 00:30:22,386
[SPEAKER_16]: But I have to say this about Chicago.

371
00:30:22,447 --> 00:30:25,509
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the first movie I really liked that I hated all the characters in.

372
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:29,312
[SPEAKER_16]: I hate every single damn character in that movie.

373
00:30:29,872 --> 00:30:31,494
[SPEAKER_16]: I hated the blonde whoever.

374
00:30:31,934 --> 00:30:32,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Renee Zellweger?

375
00:30:32,775 --> 00:30:35,897
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, and I hated Catherine Zeta-Jones' character a whole lot.

376
00:30:36,277 --> 00:30:36,858
[SPEAKER_16]: I liked the...

377
00:30:39,491 --> 00:30:43,233
[SPEAKER_16]: The ballerina girl who got, you know... Spoilers.

378
00:30:43,754 --> 00:30:44,694
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not going to spoil.

379
00:30:44,794 --> 00:30:47,696
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, but... The one that didn't speak English.

380
00:30:48,776 --> 00:30:49,457
[SPEAKER_16]: She was nice.

381
00:30:49,677 --> 00:30:54,220
[SPEAKER_03]: You, of all people, must have loved that song where they talked about killing all their boyfriends.

382
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:57,121
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh yeah, that was my favorite.

383
00:30:58,662 --> 00:31:01,584
[SPEAKER_16]: And I also liked the whole scene with the courtroom with the tap dance.

384
00:31:03,042 --> 00:31:05,544
[SPEAKER_16]: The thing is that I really love the cinematography in the movie.

385
00:31:05,884 --> 00:31:09,866
[SPEAKER_16]: I like how they integrated all the song numbers with the reality.

386
00:31:11,046 --> 00:31:12,887
[SPEAKER_16]: And I love the music.

387
00:31:12,987 --> 00:31:13,767
[SPEAKER_16]: I love the songs.

388
00:31:13,807 --> 00:31:14,768
[SPEAKER_16]: Everybody sang well.

389
00:31:15,108 --> 00:31:17,249
[SPEAKER_16]: But I hated every single last character.

390
00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:20,330
[SPEAKER_16]: And the character I hated the most was the woman's husband.

391
00:31:21,631 --> 00:31:21,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

392
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,310
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't feel sorry for him at all.

393
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,291
[SPEAKER_16]: Guy asked for it.

394
00:31:24,951 --> 00:31:30,932
[SPEAKER_16]: He was a big, stupid sap the whole damn time, and if he had any balls to him, he would have divorced her that moment.

395
00:31:31,172 --> 00:31:32,353
[SPEAKER_16]: He wouldn't have done anything.

396
00:31:32,393 --> 00:31:33,933
[SPEAKER_16]: He would have said, excuse me, bitch.

397
00:31:37,294 --> 00:31:37,634
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

398
00:31:37,814 --> 00:31:39,155
[SPEAKER_03]: You're quite feisty tonight.

399
00:31:39,195 --> 00:31:39,575
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm enjoying this.

400
00:31:39,595 --> 00:31:40,695
[SPEAKER_16]: I am in a mood.

401
00:31:40,955 --> 00:31:41,615
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm enjoying this.

402
00:31:41,755 --> 00:31:42,996
[SPEAKER_16]: But I'm going to go see Phantom of the Mars.

403
00:31:43,016 --> 00:31:43,336
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm happy.

404
00:31:43,536 --> 00:31:47,537
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you my favorite character in the whole movie, and this is totally the gay in me talking, but I don't care.

405
00:31:49,355 --> 00:31:52,798
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're good to mama, mama's good to you.

406
00:31:52,838 --> 00:31:55,800
[SPEAKER_16]: That was actually, I have to say, that's my second favorite song in it.

407
00:31:56,241 --> 00:31:57,822
[SPEAKER_16]: She's a really nice voice.

408
00:31:57,982 --> 00:32:01,065
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have never expected Queen Latifah to be in that role, but she's awesome.

409
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:07,570
[SPEAKER_16]: I heard her sing at the Oscars, because they televised that, and that's actually the only part of the Oscars I watched that year, was just to hear her sing.

410
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,451
[SPEAKER_16]: She rocks.

411
00:32:08,471 --> 00:32:10,872
[SPEAKER_16]: Because she filled in for, what's her name, because she was pregnant.

412
00:32:11,633 --> 00:32:12,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.

413
00:32:13,254 --> 00:32:13,835
[SPEAKER_16]: She did very good.

414
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:16,437
[SPEAKER_02]: I never realized just, like, what a great voice Queen Latifah has.

415
00:32:17,958 --> 00:32:18,819
[SPEAKER_16]: She's a very good voice.

416
00:32:19,656 --> 00:32:28,800
[SPEAKER_16]: But one thing, though, that I really have to say this, though, costuming-wise, is that they should not have put Renee Zelliger in some of those clothes because she just doesn't have the figure for it.

417
00:32:29,601 --> 00:32:31,161
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I remember originally... She's built like a boy.

418
00:32:31,461 --> 00:32:32,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Madonna was supposed to be in that movie.

419
00:32:32,682 --> 00:32:33,723
[SPEAKER_03]: That would have been cool.

420
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:34,663
[SPEAKER_03]: That would have been interesting.

421
00:32:35,483 --> 00:32:36,844
[SPEAKER_16]: She would have been really good in that role, too.

422
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:37,864
[SPEAKER_16]: That would have been wrong.

423
00:32:37,924 --> 00:32:40,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually, she was supposed to be the Catherine Zeta-Jones one.

424
00:32:40,326 --> 00:32:40,806
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, really?

425
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:41,706
[SPEAKER_16]: Huh.

426
00:32:41,786 --> 00:32:42,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

427
00:32:43,047 --> 00:32:43,327
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

428
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,412
[SPEAKER_16]: Who cares?

429
00:32:45,452 --> 00:32:48,393
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are here to listen about video games and here we are talking musicals.

430
00:32:49,393 --> 00:32:52,774
[SPEAKER_16]: The thing is, believe it or not, we did not watch Rocky.

431
00:32:52,794 --> 00:32:54,655
[SPEAKER_16]: Really?

432
00:32:54,675 --> 00:32:56,335
[SPEAKER_16]: We had a musical night and didn't watch Rocky.

433
00:32:59,396 --> 00:33:00,416
[SPEAKER_16]: That was my week.

434
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:04,557
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I have issues with certain things.

435
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:07,477
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't like anybody in that damn movie.

436
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:08,738
[SPEAKER_16]: Not a one.

437
00:33:09,378 --> 00:33:09,758
[SPEAKER_16]: Not a one.

438
00:33:11,161 --> 00:33:11,681
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all right.

439
00:33:11,902 --> 00:33:12,422
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I'm done.

440
00:33:12,582 --> 00:33:12,982
[SPEAKER_03]: You're done?

441
00:33:13,723 --> 00:33:14,023
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

442
00:33:14,684 --> 00:33:19,207
[SPEAKER_03]: I was actually going to see, I thought I actually had the When You're Good to Mama song from Chicago.

443
00:33:19,227 --> 00:33:20,968
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to play a little clip, but I can't find it, so.

444
00:33:22,129 --> 00:33:24,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Our listeners are spared from musical night.

445
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:25,071
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be great.

446
00:33:25,091 --> 00:33:25,892
[SPEAKER_03]: We should have musical night.

447
00:33:26,392 --> 00:33:29,495
[SPEAKER_16]: Dude, do you have the Husband Killing song?

448
00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:30,856
[SPEAKER_03]: I had it somewhere.

449
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:31,736
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know where it is, though.

450
00:33:31,756 --> 00:33:31,997
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, no.

451
00:33:32,037 --> 00:33:34,118
[SPEAKER_16]: We should play that during the break.

452
00:33:34,518 --> 00:33:37,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe during the afterbirth, even though we don't really have an afterbirth anymore, but.

453
00:33:38,536 --> 00:33:39,496
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to play that.

454
00:33:39,536 --> 00:33:40,616
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll see what I can find.

455
00:33:40,836 --> 00:33:41,317
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

456
00:33:41,397 --> 00:33:44,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I will find it for you and you can use it as a fortune cookie next week, maybe.

457
00:33:44,717 --> 00:33:44,957
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

458
00:33:45,057 --> 00:33:45,818
[SPEAKER_16]: There you go.

459
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:48,918
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to go find the... Okay, I'm going to download it when I get home.

460
00:33:48,938 --> 00:33:50,218
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to find the soundtrack and play Tuesday.

461
00:33:50,238 --> 00:33:51,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there you go.

462
00:33:51,139 --> 00:33:51,419
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll play it.

463
00:33:51,439 --> 00:33:52,879
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I look forward to.

464
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:53,619
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll pump up the volume.

465
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,600
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to plug Pump Up the Volume real fast, Jamie?

466
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,340
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, Pump Up the Volume is Tuesday.

467
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,340
[SPEAKER_16]: Tune the hell in.

468
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,661
[SPEAKER_16]: At six... I'm sorry.

469
00:34:00,921 --> 00:34:04,421
[SPEAKER_16]: It's supposed to be at seven o'clock for the pre-show, but I usually start around 645.

470
00:34:04,701 --> 00:34:06,522
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I'm bored.

471
00:34:07,162 --> 00:34:07,422
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

472
00:34:08,941 --> 00:34:15,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on and as much as it pains me to move away from musicals, we're going to talk to Loki for a minute and ask Loki, how was your week?

473
00:34:15,785 --> 00:34:16,326
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your day?

474
00:34:19,468 --> 00:34:20,368
[SPEAKER_24]: My week was pretty good.

475
00:34:20,388 --> 00:34:24,451
[SPEAKER_24]: I got the rest of my stuff in from my computer thing.

476
00:34:25,372 --> 00:34:34,638
[SPEAKER_24]: I haven't really gotten to work much on that because I spent most of the day, well, part of the day yesterday looking for my drill bit set and I finally found it on top of the cabinet.

477
00:34:35,259 --> 00:34:35,519
[SPEAKER_24]: So...

478
00:34:36,311 --> 00:34:36,752
[SPEAKER_24]: Thanks for watching!

479
00:34:52,701 --> 00:34:53,042
[SPEAKER_24]: What else?

480
00:34:53,102 --> 00:34:56,885
[SPEAKER_24]: I went out to dinner last night to Tahoe Joe's.

481
00:34:56,925 --> 00:34:59,468
[SPEAKER_24]: And they're okay, but their mashed potatoes taste like shit.

482
00:35:00,609 --> 00:35:02,451
[SPEAKER_24]: Other than that, their food was decent.

483
00:35:02,471 --> 00:35:08,456
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't really like going back there because, I don't know, there was a lot of stuff I didn't like about them.

484
00:35:09,257 --> 00:35:09,898
[SPEAKER_24]: But whatever.

485
00:35:10,118 --> 00:35:13,962
[SPEAKER_24]: It was fun to try because I had a gift certificate, so, you know, free dinner.

486
00:35:16,263 --> 00:35:18,184
[SPEAKER_24]: Thanks for watching and see you next time!

487
00:35:35,982 --> 00:35:54,592
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I don't remember if I mentioned this last week, because I can't remember exactly when in the timeline this took place, but apparently the store chain that I do customer service for, Movie Gallery, purchased Hollywood Video, in which case they're probably going to go to self-distribution, which I don't see how that's possible, considering they're retarded.

488
00:35:55,532 --> 00:35:57,953
[SPEAKER_24]: So that means I might be out of a job anyway.

489
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:02,736
[SPEAKER_24]: But, no, they just relocate me to some customer service job.

490
00:36:03,556 --> 00:36:03,997
[SPEAKER_24]: No thanks.

491
00:36:04,057 --> 00:36:04,637
[SPEAKER_24]: Basically...

492
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:06,652
[SPEAKER_24]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

493
00:36:21,011 --> 00:36:21,812
[SPEAKER_24]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

494
00:36:43,008 --> 00:36:55,923
[SPEAKER_24]: So, basically, after spending seven straight hours title matching, which I might add to you is very draining and very tedious, I finally got done, and so I submitted the stuff off to them, and, you know, they were happy.

495
00:36:55,943 --> 00:37:03,531
[SPEAKER_24]: They were like, well, we wouldn't have had you do it if, you know, we knew it was going to take that long or, you know, it was going to be that much work, so, yay.

496
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,052
[SPEAKER_24]: But...

497
00:37:04,711 --> 00:37:13,593
[SPEAKER_24]: Because I was worn out or whatever, I somehow forgot to delete the order, so one of each of these 3,000 titles or whatever came into one of our branches.

498
00:37:14,993 --> 00:37:31,537
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that mistake cost the company, well, right now it's costing them about, I don't know, a couple, I don't know, tens of thousands of dollars, which in the grand scheme of things isn't that much, considering they can turn around and return all this stuff, but they're just making a big deal about it right now.

499
00:37:32,392 --> 00:37:34,453
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know why, but, you know, whatever.

500
00:37:34,693 --> 00:37:37,294
[SPEAKER_24]: So, that's that.

501
00:37:37,394 --> 00:37:38,934
[SPEAKER_24]: And so I gotta deal with that on Monday.

502
00:37:39,274 --> 00:37:39,834
[SPEAKER_24]: Fun, fun.

503
00:37:40,194 --> 00:37:42,115
[SPEAKER_24]: And, um, yeah.

504
00:37:42,335 --> 00:37:43,556
[SPEAKER_24]: So that was pretty much my week.

505
00:37:44,036 --> 00:37:45,236
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, kinda sucked.

506
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,177
[SPEAKER_24]: But, uh, yeah.

507
00:37:47,757 --> 00:37:54,959
[SPEAKER_24]: So, I gotta be looking for a new job anyways because, uh, you know, this one isn't doing a very good job paying the bills.

508
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:56,380
[SPEAKER_24]: Need more money.

509
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,180
[SPEAKER_24]: And besides, they're not moving me anywhere, so.

510
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:00,741
[SPEAKER_24]: Yep, need out.

511
00:38:02,128 --> 00:38:03,468
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's pretty much all that happened.

512
00:38:04,209 --> 00:38:05,509
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, and that and a lot of Final Fantasy.

513
00:38:07,749 --> 00:38:07,849
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh.

514
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:11,710
[SPEAKER_16]: I did have one thing to say since you said the evil addict word.

515
00:38:11,931 --> 00:38:12,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

516
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:18,672
[SPEAKER_16]: Because the copies literally fell onto my lap.

517
00:38:20,073 --> 00:38:22,313
[SPEAKER_16]: No, this was fate saying something.

518
00:38:23,033 --> 00:38:28,895
[SPEAKER_16]: I was doing some cleaning out of some drawers and onto my lap fell a series of discs in a box.

519
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:33,331
[SPEAKER_16]: Right next to them is a book that has certain key codes in it.

520
00:38:34,431 --> 00:38:37,612
[SPEAKER_16]: And right next to that was a little notepad with all my passwords on it.

521
00:38:38,912 --> 00:38:41,233
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm going to be rejoining the stupid world.

522
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:42,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Of?

523
00:38:43,414 --> 00:38:44,514
[SPEAKER_16]: Stupid Addict Game.

524
00:38:45,394 --> 00:38:47,815
[SPEAKER_03]: You mean you're going to sign up for Final Fantasy XI?

525
00:38:48,015 --> 00:38:49,195
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I'm canceling AOL.

526
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:50,175
[SPEAKER_16]: Addict!

527
00:38:50,636 --> 00:38:51,616
[SPEAKER_16]: No, not really.

528
00:38:53,796 --> 00:38:59,618
[SPEAKER_16]: It's for multiple purposes for me, and that and the fact that gravity has turned into a bunch of retards.

529
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,801
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm actually going to quit Final Fantasy XI when Ragnarok 2 comes out.

530
00:39:03,502 --> 00:39:05,263
[SPEAKER_24]: They turned into?

531
00:39:05,963 --> 00:39:07,204
[SPEAKER_24]: Meaning they weren't before?

532
00:39:07,524 --> 00:39:09,965
[SPEAKER_16]: They got increasingly stupid.

533
00:39:10,305 --> 00:39:18,229
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I was thinking about rejoining RO and World of Warcraft and when they filled up their servers in two weeks I just decided no.

534
00:39:18,429 --> 00:39:23,212
[SPEAKER_03]: You may remember back to when LankyStyle and I used to impersonate the Gravity personnel.

535
00:39:23,732 --> 00:39:25,433
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to talk bad about company?

536
00:39:25,673 --> 00:39:26,634
[SPEAKER_04]: We ban you!

537
00:39:26,894 --> 00:39:28,375
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to have bots on our server?

538
00:39:28,655 --> 00:39:29,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Ban!

539
00:39:30,003 --> 00:39:30,343
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

540
00:39:31,264 --> 00:39:34,045
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, why not?

541
00:39:34,445 --> 00:39:35,745
[SPEAKER_16]: And I have people to play with.

542
00:39:36,506 --> 00:39:46,230
[SPEAKER_16]: And I figured I'm probably going to be so bombarded with school and everything else, it's going to be a good distraction.

543
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:54,753
[SPEAKER_03]: The nice thing is that Angel plays on Final Fantasy XI now, and I love Angel because she is such our bitch.

544
00:39:55,453 --> 00:39:56,694
[SPEAKER_03]: And she will be your bitch, too.

545
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,028
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, Thief.

546
00:40:27,642 --> 00:40:28,323
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for watching!

547
00:40:40,073 --> 00:40:43,255
[SPEAKER_24]: I guess Warrior to start off with because that'll be the easiest.

548
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:44,116
[SPEAKER_24]: You just hit shit.

549
00:40:44,716 --> 00:40:45,457
[SPEAKER_24]: That's pretty much it.

550
00:40:46,157 --> 00:40:47,418
[SPEAKER_24]: Can't get any easier than that.

551
00:40:47,438 --> 00:40:48,880
[SPEAKER_16]: I want Thief stuff to get money.

552
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:54,384
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I was just thinking that, you know, I just thought, ah, Ninja stuff is hella expensive.

553
00:40:54,404 --> 00:40:56,646
[SPEAKER_16]: Then I thought, wait a minute, Ranger's the most expensive in the game.

554
00:40:56,666 --> 00:41:00,168
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe there's not any merchant class like there is in Ragnarok because merchants are owned.

555
00:41:00,909 --> 00:41:01,890
[SPEAKER_16]: You just go outside and...

556
00:41:02,762 --> 00:41:03,062
[SPEAKER_16]: Petal.

557
00:41:03,482 --> 00:41:09,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe they'll add something to Final Fantasy XI in the future, but I don't want to turn this into Final Fantasy XI chat.

558
00:41:09,446 --> 00:41:11,727
[SPEAKER_16]: I figured that I would mention the decision, so.

559
00:41:12,647 --> 00:41:15,149
[SPEAKER_16]: Should I bring up that Gravity thing, since she kind of mentioned it?

560
00:41:15,769 --> 00:41:16,129
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

561
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:23,793
[SPEAKER_16]: Gravity came out with a new game that has, like, the same sound effects as Ragnarok, which was kind of weird.

562
00:41:24,174 --> 00:41:25,234
[SPEAKER_16]: It's called Rose.

563
00:41:25,975 --> 00:41:27,055
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if you've heard about it, Jamie.

564
00:41:27,095 --> 00:41:29,957
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I have, and I've actually signed up for an account on Rose Online.

565
00:41:29,977 --> 00:41:32,078
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I've got one as well, so we can play there, too.

566
00:41:32,098 --> 00:41:32,298
[SPEAKER_16]: Haha.

567
00:41:34,349 --> 00:41:35,389
[SPEAKER_24]: Rosarock Online.

568
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,511
[SPEAKER_24]: There, yes, we're going to just change the name of this.

569
00:41:39,531 --> 00:41:41,231
[SPEAKER_16]: Dude, you can be a pirate on an airship.

570
00:41:42,172 --> 00:41:43,332
[SPEAKER_16]: How rad is that?

571
00:41:44,672 --> 00:41:46,013
[SPEAKER_16]: I forgot what it stands for, though.

572
00:41:46,853 --> 00:41:47,954
[SPEAKER_16]: My brain drew a blank.

573
00:41:47,974 --> 00:41:50,494
[SPEAKER_16]: Something of seven events.

574
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:54,016
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to be pirates, you better follow rules, or we ban you.

575
00:41:54,096 --> 00:41:55,176
[SPEAKER_16]: We make you walk plank.

576
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,917
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's Road of Seven Events or something.

577
00:41:59,384 --> 00:42:00,504
[SPEAKER_03]: What exactly do you do in this game?

578
00:42:00,824 --> 00:42:03,645
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like Ragnarok, but it's 3D.

579
00:42:03,865 --> 00:42:05,845
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, 3D and, yeah, there you go.

580
00:42:06,626 --> 00:42:09,246
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just like Ragnarok, but it's more 3D and it's cool and, yeah.

581
00:42:11,847 --> 00:42:13,007
[SPEAKER_16]: So, yeah, more game stuff.

582
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:20,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this time when you sign up, you're going to be a good girl and go with Sandoria as opposed to Bastok, right?

583
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:20,929
[SPEAKER_16]: I suppose.

584
00:42:21,889 --> 00:42:24,950
[SPEAKER_16]: I learned my way around Bastok pretty damn well because I kept dying.

585
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:26,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Or as we call it, Lastok.

586
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:29,676
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe I'll go to Winters.

587
00:42:31,197 --> 00:42:34,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Winters, the only problem with Winters is that you get lost there very easily.

588
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, it went back to Final Fantasy XI chat.

589
00:42:37,123 --> 00:42:39,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Bad host, bad, bad, bad.

590
00:42:39,445 --> 00:42:40,325
[SPEAKER_03]: So how was your week, Rob?

591
00:42:41,847 --> 00:42:43,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm so glad you asked, Jamie.

592
00:42:44,349 --> 00:42:45,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you done, Loki?

593
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:45,490
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

594
00:42:48,653 --> 00:42:50,935
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, well, Winters sucks because it's so big.

595
00:42:51,395 --> 00:42:52,877
[SPEAKER_24]: Stop it now, stop now.

596
00:42:57,188 --> 00:43:02,131
[SPEAKER_03]: My week and my day were pretty good, I guess I also played a lot of that

597
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:10,165
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm looking forward to tonight because I'm actually going to be going out tonight and I'm going to the Goth Club.

598
00:43:10,645 --> 00:43:14,627
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we've joked about this on the show a few weeks ago before, you know, last time I went.

599
00:43:15,147 --> 00:43:18,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually when a three-day weekend comes up, Rob does one of two things.

600
00:43:18,349 --> 00:43:21,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Either Rob drinks on the show or Rob goes to the Goth Club.

601
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:26,232
[SPEAKER_03]: So tonight I opted for Goth Club because Gwana Girl is going to meet me out there because she hasn't been to the Goth Club for a while.

602
00:43:26,292 --> 00:43:31,314
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to go and as you can see, I'm dressed in all black right now and I'll go model on the cam again in a minute.

603
00:43:32,939 --> 00:43:47,780
[SPEAKER_03]: and um and uh we're just gonna go and we're gonna look sit in the corner and look tragic you're gonna goth serve we're totally gonna goth serve people it'll be great um and um

604
00:43:48,527 --> 00:43:49,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy Handbag Sylvia Drive

605
00:44:16,363 --> 00:44:16,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma 1.5

606
00:44:37,782 --> 00:44:52,909
[SPEAKER_03]: and I got to see the first couple episodes and it's one of those animes I actually enjoy I think it's so cute, it makes me laugh and we were going to play Metroid Prime 2 Echoes because I'm really curious to check out that game but I don't know, we ran out of time we ended up watching A Mighty Wind instead

607
00:44:54,281 --> 00:44:54,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Go figure.

608
00:44:55,981 --> 00:45:03,883
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, well, Christopher made us watch episodes of Upright Citizens Brigade, which was this old show that was on Comedy Central a couple years ago, like five, six years ago.

609
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:06,023
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually kind of funny.

610
00:45:06,123 --> 00:45:07,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, some of it was really funny.

611
00:45:07,743 --> 00:45:09,964
[SPEAKER_03]: The concept, I really liked the concept.

612
00:45:10,524 --> 00:45:14,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the humor was a little, like it was hit and miss, but I thought the concept was great.

613
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:15,485
[SPEAKER_03]: And the girl in that show rocks.

614
00:45:16,205 --> 00:45:16,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

615
00:45:17,745 --> 00:45:19,205
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's pretty much it for my week and my day.

616
00:45:19,325 --> 00:45:21,646
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't do anything that exciting, game-wise.

617
00:45:22,146 --> 00:45:22,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Except that one game.

618
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:27,381
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, speaking of anime, a friend of mine got me onto an anime lately.

619
00:45:27,401 --> 00:45:29,102
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been watching Fruits Basket.

620
00:45:29,222 --> 00:45:29,762
[SPEAKER_16]: It's cute.

621
00:45:30,062 --> 00:45:30,982
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't think I'd like it.

622
00:45:32,723 --> 00:45:33,623
[SPEAKER_14]: Ah, you meanie!

623
00:45:34,083 --> 00:45:35,183
[SPEAKER_16]: I would have bought it from you.

624
00:45:37,924 --> 00:45:44,386
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sure they have it cheap, not... That's okay, because I have rips of the DVDs.

625
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:46,286
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, pictures of them.

626
00:45:46,586 --> 00:45:48,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us, for those of us that are not as into anime...

627
00:45:49,676 --> 00:45:50,616
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to spoil it.

628
00:45:50,636 --> 00:45:51,356
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cute.

629
00:45:51,396 --> 00:45:54,117
[SPEAKER_03]: What's kind of the main part?

630
00:45:54,257 --> 00:45:55,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us about some of the characters or something.

631
00:45:56,857 --> 00:45:58,058
[SPEAKER_16]: The best character is Kyo.

632
00:45:59,118 --> 00:46:00,098
[SPEAKER_16]: Because he's violent.

633
00:46:01,478 --> 00:46:02,159
[SPEAKER_16]: I like violence.

634
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:02,899
[SPEAKER_02]: And you like violence.

635
00:46:02,919 --> 00:46:03,299
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all.

636
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:09,300
[SPEAKER_16]: And no, I'm not watching Naruto because everybody in the goddamn universe is watching Naruto.

637
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,300
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not watching it.

638
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,260
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't watch it.

639
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:12,801
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been reading the manga, though.

640
00:46:12,821 --> 00:46:13,461
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't watch it.

641
00:46:14,141 --> 00:46:15,401
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't watch any anime.

642
00:46:15,621 --> 00:46:18,282
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that they got me to watch Ranma is amazing.

643
00:46:18,462 --> 00:46:19,362
[SPEAKER_03]: So, anyway.

644
00:46:20,253 --> 00:46:24,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on, Bradley, Arcadian42, our quiet man in the corner there.

645
00:46:25,136 --> 00:46:25,736
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your week?

646
00:46:25,756 --> 00:46:26,196
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your day?

647
00:46:27,097 --> 00:46:29,578
[SPEAKER_09]: My week was just a regular old week.

648
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:32,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Work and not much else.

649
00:46:34,421 --> 00:46:41,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Though I've had, for like the past two weeks, I've had crappy cold and sniffly and coffee and all this kind of crap.

650
00:46:42,045 --> 00:46:44,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of probably the same stuff that Jamie's had.

651
00:46:44,907 --> 00:46:46,908
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of, it's annoying.

652
00:46:47,974 --> 00:46:51,996
[SPEAKER_09]: This weekend I played some old school Super Nintendo games.

653
00:46:52,216 --> 00:46:55,358
[SPEAKER_09]: Played Actraiser and played Link to the Past.

654
00:46:56,418 --> 00:46:57,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are two very sexy games.

655
00:46:58,519 --> 00:47:02,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, and that's about everything I did of any interest at all.

656
00:47:05,262 --> 00:47:05,902
[SPEAKER_09]: On to the next.

657
00:47:06,583 --> 00:47:09,504
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just thinking about Actraiser for a minute and what a great game that is.

658
00:47:13,255 --> 00:47:13,455
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

659
00:47:14,135 --> 00:47:14,616
[SPEAKER_03]: What, DarkSakura?

660
00:47:14,656 --> 00:47:17,938
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know, people keep mentioning stuff that makes me remember the stuff I did during the week.

661
00:47:19,259 --> 00:47:20,439
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you think of now?

662
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,302
[SPEAKER_16]: Last night, falling asleep watching Dan play Metroid.

663
00:47:25,102 --> 00:47:26,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Metroid or like old school?

664
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:26,863
[SPEAKER_16]: Metroid.

665
00:47:27,704 --> 00:47:28,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's hot.

666
00:47:28,504 --> 00:47:29,225
[SPEAKER_16]: And Bionic Commando.

667
00:47:30,105 --> 00:47:30,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Man.

668
00:47:30,706 --> 00:47:31,866
[SPEAKER_16]: Watching Hitler blow up.

669
00:47:32,187 --> 00:47:33,327
[SPEAKER_03]: All these sexy games.

670
00:47:33,908 --> 00:47:35,949
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to have like a sexy retro night.

671
00:47:35,969 --> 00:47:36,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

672
00:47:36,852 --> 00:47:43,876
[SPEAKER_16]: No, if you're going to do that, though, I'm going to be bringing over... No, I'll bring over Sexy Parodius.

673
00:47:45,097 --> 00:47:48,019
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll bring over the... Sexy Parodius didn't have an arcade release.

674
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:52,642
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we need to play... This is what we're going to play.

675
00:47:53,262 --> 00:47:55,724
[SPEAKER_03]: We would have to play Actraiser, even though it's not multiplayer.

676
00:47:55,764 --> 00:47:57,485
[SPEAKER_03]: We could have it on for like 30 minutes at least.

677
00:47:58,045 --> 00:47:59,826
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we would play Guardian Legend.

678
00:48:00,407 --> 00:48:01,988
[SPEAKER_03]: We would all sit around and watch... Oh, hell yeah!

679
00:48:02,048 --> 00:48:04,169
[SPEAKER_03]: We would all sit around and watch me play Guardian Legend.

680
00:48:04,709 --> 00:48:05,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that game is awesome.

681
00:48:06,477 --> 00:48:18,862
[SPEAKER_03]: and then we would sit around and watch me play A Link to the Past and then you guys are going to sit around and watch me play Actaracer again and then you would sit around and watch me play Metroid and then what else can you guys watch me play?

682
00:48:19,942 --> 00:48:21,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't this night sound like fun?

683
00:48:23,164 --> 00:48:25,505
[SPEAKER_16]: I just thought of one but you're going to hit me so never mind.

684
00:48:26,905 --> 00:48:31,327
[SPEAKER_16]: You'd be playing Guardian Legend and then I'd take the controller and show you how to play Guardian Legend.

685
00:48:31,347 --> 00:48:33,488
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh snap!

686
00:48:33,808 --> 00:48:35,609
[SPEAKER_16]: The only levels I actually couldn't beat there were 10 and 20.

687
00:48:37,854 --> 00:48:40,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Angel, how was your week?

688
00:48:40,235 --> 00:48:40,835
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your day?

689
00:49:01,502 --> 00:49:02,102
[SPEAKER_16]: Pretty good.

690
00:49:03,183 --> 00:49:05,444
[SPEAKER_16]: Had to get ready for school and stuff because that starts this week.

691
00:49:05,605 --> 00:49:05,945
[SPEAKER_16]: Yay.

692
00:49:07,426 --> 00:49:12,749
[SPEAKER_16]: Didn't play too, too much of that evil game that I can't mention now because you're going to fire me, right?

693
00:49:16,671 --> 00:49:20,654
[SPEAKER_16]: Lots of... Well, I played a little bit of it, but whatever.

694
00:49:22,275 --> 00:49:23,856
[SPEAKER_16]: Other than that, not too, too much.

695
00:49:23,896 --> 00:49:24,976
[SPEAKER_16]: I do have to work tomorrow, though.

696
00:49:25,597 --> 00:49:25,957
[SPEAKER_16]: Dope.

697
00:49:26,717 --> 00:49:27,198
[SPEAKER_16]: Dope.

698
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:28,138
[SPEAKER_16]: Yuck.

699
00:49:29,239 --> 00:49:29,499
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't.

700
00:49:30,086 --> 00:49:30,927
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, well, oh well.

701
00:49:31,247 --> 00:49:32,348
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, see, Loki does.

702
00:49:34,069 --> 00:49:34,849
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, not too much.

703
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:36,250
[SPEAKER_16]: Other than that.

704
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:43,835
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, and, um, LiveJournal went down this week, if anybody knew about that, for 24 hours.

705
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:46,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, my world ended when LiveJournal collapsed.

706
00:49:46,957 --> 00:49:47,697
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm kidding, it didn't.

707
00:49:47,737 --> 00:49:52,420
[SPEAKER_03]: But seriously, did you notice how many people suddenly were like, I have to go outside.

708
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:53,941
[SPEAKER_03]: LiveJournal's down.

709
00:49:55,197 --> 00:50:03,403
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that was pretty funny, because as soon as it came back up, all of my friends were going, Oh my god, I couldn't live without LiveJournal!

710
00:50:04,124 --> 00:50:04,924
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh my god, it's back up!

711
00:50:04,965 --> 00:50:05,205
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

712
00:50:05,445 --> 00:50:11,429
[SPEAKER_16]: As soon as it went back up, everybody was posting about it and whatever, so everyone had their withdrawal.

713
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:23,839
[SPEAKER_16]: I only jumped on just to see, you know, what friends lists were doing and all that stuff, and to see if a certain other show was going on, but I couldn't do that because LiveJournal was down, so...

714
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of LiveJournal, what an excellent chance to plug our community.

715
00:50:29,161 --> 00:50:30,522
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually have a LiveJournal community.

716
00:50:30,582 --> 00:50:32,043
[SPEAKER_03]: It's username OrangeLounge.

717
00:50:32,103 --> 00:50:32,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Check it out.

718
00:50:32,823 --> 00:50:33,923
[SPEAKER_16]: That's really difficult to remember.

719
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:36,244
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of us, though, had DeadJournals to go to.

720
00:50:38,485 --> 00:50:41,326
[SPEAKER_03]: And DeadJournals that never get used unless LiveJournal's down, right?

721
00:50:41,486 --> 00:50:41,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

722
00:50:42,867 --> 00:50:43,207
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

723
00:50:43,587 --> 00:50:43,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair enough.

724
00:50:45,448 --> 00:50:45,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

725
00:50:45,928 --> 00:50:47,149
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's it for your weekend day?

726
00:50:48,469 --> 00:50:52,391
[SPEAKER_16]: Before I forget, I forgot to mention the website for that Rose game.

727
00:50:52,471 --> 00:50:53,991
[SPEAKER_16]: It's RoseOn.com.

728
00:50:54,031 --> 00:50:54,612
[SPEAKER_16]: It's all one word.

729
00:50:55,212 --> 00:50:55,412
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

730
00:50:57,105 --> 00:50:57,986
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the chat room.

731
00:50:58,226 --> 00:51:05,831
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry because I don't know who said this first, but another game at our sexy retro game-a-thon where you guys are going to sit around and watch me play games.

732
00:51:06,552 --> 00:51:07,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Blaster Master.

733
00:51:07,392 --> 00:51:14,777
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are going to sit around and watch me play Blaster Master because that would be probably the second best 8-bit game ever made.

734
00:51:14,917 --> 00:51:17,499
[SPEAKER_16]: That's when I actually bring over the collection.

735
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,042
[SPEAKER_16]: And I have to say, the collection.

736
00:51:21,842 --> 00:51:25,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and then we can sit around and talk about how much the other Blaster Master games sucked.

737
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:40,195
[SPEAKER_16]: All of the Mega Man games to date, up to, I think, I think I have that through X4 on Saturn, and then I have, like, I think 5 and 6, and then that's it.

738
00:51:40,635 --> 00:51:42,236
[SPEAKER_16]: But I have all of the NES ones.

739
00:51:43,056 --> 00:51:44,056
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what would be great?

740
00:51:45,117 --> 00:51:46,237
[SPEAKER_03]: I will never forget this.

741
00:51:46,297 --> 00:51:52,119
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the very first times I met DarkSakura, I went to her house, actually, because I got invited to her house pretty quick.

742
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:54,360
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I walked in,

743
00:51:55,373 --> 00:51:57,954
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

744
00:52:15,776 --> 00:52:16,276
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed that.

745
00:52:17,416 --> 00:52:19,997
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea why, but there was one random Splatterhouse.

746
00:52:20,417 --> 00:52:24,578
[SPEAKER_03]: All these guys in the house playing Zelda and yelling and screaming.

747
00:52:24,598 --> 00:52:25,338
[SPEAKER_03]: It was awesome.

748
00:52:25,418 --> 00:52:26,018
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in heaven.

749
00:52:26,678 --> 00:52:27,959
[SPEAKER_03]: And didn't you call that a LAN party?

750
00:52:28,139 --> 00:52:29,339
[SPEAKER_03]: A local area Nintendo party?

751
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:30,279
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it was a LAN party.

752
00:52:30,459 --> 00:52:31,319
[SPEAKER_16]: Local area Nintendo.

753
00:52:31,479 --> 00:52:33,240
[SPEAKER_16]: And they did the same with Mega Man 2 after.

754
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:36,920
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I was going to say, you need to do something like that, but on each TV have a different Mega Man game.

755
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:39,621
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be so hot.

756
00:52:41,027 --> 00:52:44,688
[SPEAKER_16]: Watching Andrew do that in an hour was scary as hell.

757
00:52:44,708 --> 00:52:45,888
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going, holy crap!

758
00:52:46,249 --> 00:52:47,169
[SPEAKER_16]: But that's Andrew for you.

759
00:52:47,189 --> 00:52:47,989
[SPEAKER_16]: He's Mega Man boy.

760
00:52:48,089 --> 00:53:00,253
[SPEAKER_16]: I've done the dragon level of... I've actually beat the dragon on Mega Man 2 blindfolded.

761
00:53:02,293 --> 00:53:02,913
[SPEAKER_16]: That's hot.

762
00:53:03,073 --> 00:53:08,635
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't do it now, but when I played that game all the damn time, I had all of my jumps

763
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:16,453
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like, basically, when you get to the platform right before you jump, that's when I was blindfolded, and I made all my jumps, hit it up there, and knew exactly where all my jumps were.

764
00:53:16,613 --> 00:53:29,579
[SPEAKER_03]: I could see, like, I could just picture it in my mind, Jamie sitting there in her camo, with a blindfold on, and the controller in her hand, and a candy cigarette in her mouth, because not a real one, because she doesn't smoke, but a candy cigarette in her mouth, just sitting there, bring it on.

765
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:31,620
[SPEAKER_16]: Whatever.

766
00:53:32,963 --> 00:53:35,464
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a non-flashback or something.

767
00:53:35,724 --> 00:53:41,166
[SPEAKER_16]: The only other game I can play blindfolded is level 8-1 on Super Mario Bros.

768
00:53:42,287 --> 00:53:44,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark Knight says Jamie was like Zen.

769
00:53:46,228 --> 00:53:47,869
[SPEAKER_03]: You channeled your Zen warrior power.

770
00:53:47,929 --> 00:53:49,469
[SPEAKER_03]: That is supreme geekness.

771
00:53:49,489 --> 00:53:51,170
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't even know I had any when I was 12.

772
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:51,930
[SPEAKER_15]: So hot.

773
00:53:53,171 --> 00:53:53,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

774
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:58,413
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm being poked fun of in the chat room for going over to a girl's house.

775
00:53:59,233 --> 00:54:01,734
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't you know they have goodies?

776
00:54:02,783 --> 00:54:03,883
[SPEAKER_24]: Don't you know they have cooties?

777
00:54:05,384 --> 00:54:08,304
[SPEAKER_16]: Remember the one guy who had his computer case built out of a toolbox?

778
00:54:08,804 --> 00:54:09,004
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

779
00:54:09,264 --> 00:54:09,865
[SPEAKER_16]: That was cool.

780
00:54:12,885 --> 00:54:13,885
[SPEAKER_16]: It was a camo toolbox.

781
00:54:17,606 --> 00:54:17,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

782
00:54:18,346 --> 00:54:20,727
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wallowing in geek right now.

783
00:54:20,767 --> 00:54:21,247
[SPEAKER_03]: This is funny.

784
00:54:21,287 --> 00:54:21,527
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

785
00:54:21,867 --> 00:54:22,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

786
00:54:23,387 --> 00:54:24,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Explicit joined us.

787
00:54:24,467 --> 00:54:25,468
[SPEAKER_03]: He walked in during the break.

788
00:54:25,608 --> 00:54:27,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Tardy there.

789
00:54:27,668 --> 00:54:28,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Tardy.

790
00:54:29,108 --> 00:54:29,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, all right.

791
00:54:29,828 --> 00:54:31,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Explicit, how was your week?

792
00:54:31,729 --> 00:54:32,229
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your day?

793
00:54:33,601 --> 00:54:34,221
[SPEAKER_07]: It was pretty cool.

794
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:38,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Some ups and downs, but most likely ups.

795
00:54:38,683 --> 00:54:39,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Any games you were playing this week?

796
00:54:42,165 --> 00:54:46,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I finished Metroid Prime 2 in like one week.

797
00:54:46,567 --> 00:54:47,107
[SPEAKER_07]: That's about it.

798
00:54:48,728 --> 00:54:50,129
[SPEAKER_07]: And beat Final Fantasy 2.

799
00:54:51,089 --> 00:54:52,850
[SPEAKER_07]: The Dawn of Souls one?

800
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,231
[SPEAKER_07]: In three days.

801
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:55,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Jeez.

802
00:54:56,191 --> 00:54:59,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I can't touch Final Fantasy 2 until I beat Final Fantasy 1.

803
00:55:00,313 --> 00:55:01,674
[SPEAKER_07]: 2 is a bitch to level up on.

804
00:55:02,879 --> 00:55:03,940
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to get used to the system.

805
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,622
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear you can do something in the beginning, though.

806
00:55:06,662 --> 00:55:07,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Make it really easy.

807
00:55:07,383 --> 00:55:09,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you level up your characters uber strong in the beginning.

808
00:55:09,424 --> 00:55:14,909
[SPEAKER_07]: You have enough time in your hands to cheat and level up so you can... There's always time for cheating.

809
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:17,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

810
00:55:17,411 --> 00:55:19,092
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll explain that on the FU's.

811
00:55:19,492 --> 00:55:19,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

812
00:55:21,574 --> 00:55:22,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else going on with your week?

813
00:55:23,435 --> 00:55:28,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, man, I was thinking of getting into a relationship with a close friend of mine, and you know that's about it.

814
00:55:29,231 --> 00:55:31,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, relations, huh?

815
00:55:32,274 --> 00:55:32,735
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

816
00:55:32,775 --> 00:55:33,936
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been having relations.

817
00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:40,843
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, updates on the tournament on February 5th.

818
00:55:41,664 --> 00:55:43,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, you're having a tournament in Sacto February 5th?

819
00:55:43,986 --> 00:55:45,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Sacto Smackdown February 5th.

820
00:55:46,328 --> 00:55:47,289
[SPEAKER_03]: I love these Jesus tournament names.

821
00:55:47,309 --> 00:55:50,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Or some people call it Piss because it says Sacto Smackdown.

822
00:55:53,091 --> 00:55:57,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Paradise Island Sacktown Smackdown, you're calling your tournament piss?

823
00:55:57,535 --> 00:55:58,596
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was not expected!

824
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, but scat was funny, but piss is really funny.

825
00:56:03,579 --> 00:56:06,342
[SPEAKER_07]: It was not expected, I was just like, oh my gosh.

826
00:56:06,442 --> 00:56:10,085
[SPEAKER_24]: And now, for the golden shower round!

827
00:56:12,426 --> 00:56:14,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Where we shower you with gold!

828
00:56:16,777 --> 00:56:18,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I co-emcee that tournament or something?

829
00:56:19,038 --> 00:56:19,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.

830
00:56:19,478 --> 00:56:25,100
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can come out and then throw gold glitter in the air and say, It's a golden shower here at Piss.

831
00:56:26,861 --> 00:56:27,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead.

832
00:56:27,421 --> 00:56:29,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Do whatever you want in the tournament.

833
00:56:34,949 --> 00:56:37,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, this is so 7th grade, but I don't care.

834
00:56:37,731 --> 00:56:39,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Do the posters say piss?

835
00:56:39,593 --> 00:56:42,695
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Chaos is the one that came up with it.

836
00:56:43,095 --> 00:56:44,637
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, ooh, it spells piss.

837
00:56:44,937 --> 00:56:49,941
[SPEAKER_07]: I was trying to prevent the word from saying ass.

838
00:56:50,221 --> 00:56:52,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, ASAC tells Smackdown, but now it says piss.

839
00:56:52,583 --> 00:56:56,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because, you know, ass would have been... Ass is looking pretty good right now, huh?

840
00:56:57,066 --> 00:57:02,170
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only time I'm going to get him to admit... Oh my gosh.

841
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:03,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

842
00:57:04,945 --> 00:57:05,366
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.

843
00:57:05,406 --> 00:57:06,766
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of tournaments are you having again?

844
00:57:07,086 --> 00:57:07,446
[SPEAKER_07]: At Piss?

845
00:57:07,547 --> 00:57:09,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, it starts at 11 or 12 o'clock.

846
00:57:10,568 --> 00:57:14,570
[SPEAKER_07]: It will contain DDR, PA, which is... The Piss begins at noon!

847
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:17,611
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god.

848
00:57:21,192 --> 00:57:25,114
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I just killed Sky on this one.

849
00:57:25,634 --> 00:57:28,576
[SPEAKER_24]: So will you be starting off on Heavy and then working your way to Light?

850
00:57:30,777 --> 00:57:31,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, that's two divisions.

851
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:37,762
[SPEAKER_07]: The Perfect Piss, and the Freestyle Piss.

852
00:57:39,603 --> 00:57:46,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god.

853
00:57:46,968 --> 00:57:48,729
[SPEAKER_07]: The first round, of course, is a PA.

854
00:57:49,749 --> 00:57:55,533
[SPEAKER_07]: The first round will determine if you're going to the intermediate or the expert division.

855
00:57:56,093 --> 00:57:56,953
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're applicable.

856
00:57:57,334 --> 00:57:59,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully you'll make it, unless you're really like the lowest seed.

857
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:05,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my gosh.

858
00:58:06,264 --> 00:58:13,226
[SPEAKER_24]: What the hell?

859
00:58:14,506 --> 00:58:15,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god.

860
00:58:16,887 --> 00:58:19,128
[SPEAKER_24]: Did you finally taste that piss in the bottle?

861
00:58:19,408 --> 00:58:22,069
[SPEAKER_24]: Fucking Dr. Pepper nasty shit?

862
00:58:22,089 --> 00:58:23,989
[SPEAKER_24]: Did it finally hit you?

863
00:58:24,549 --> 00:58:26,470
[SPEAKER_24]: Honestly, because that stuff looks nasty.

864
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:31,291
[SPEAKER_24]: Diet Dr. Pepper cherry vanilla ass juice.

865
00:58:31,451 --> 00:58:32,392
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh my god.

866
00:58:34,687 --> 00:58:44,372
[SPEAKER_03]: For those that couldn't see what just happened, I had one of those moments where I was about to laugh really, really hard because Loki just gave me that look of I'm thinking something really funny right now.

867
00:58:45,372 --> 00:58:48,594
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had to run over to the kitchen sink and spit out the drink.

868
00:58:49,394 --> 00:58:51,615
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was of course drinking that Dr. Pepper.

869
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:53,400
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

870
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:54,861
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, Explicit.

871
00:58:54,881 --> 00:58:55,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead and finish.

872
00:58:55,501 --> 00:58:55,841
[SPEAKER_07]: It's alright.

873
00:58:55,921 --> 00:58:56,461
[SPEAKER_07]: It's alright.

874
00:58:57,101 --> 00:58:59,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone's all cracking up with the title, Piss.

875
00:59:00,723 --> 00:59:08,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, there's also initial D version 3 tournaments for those interested in racing their cars.

876
00:59:10,426 --> 00:59:16,908
[SPEAKER_07]: So that should be, it's also going to be held at the same time with DDR PA as well, so time goes faster.

877
00:59:18,124 --> 00:59:19,585
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a freestyle at 6 o'clock.

878
00:59:20,006 --> 00:59:22,608
[SPEAKER_07]: This should be pretty interesting, a two-rounded DDR freestyle.

879
00:59:23,329 --> 00:59:26,471
[SPEAKER_07]: The first round is an improv with a prop.

880
00:59:26,992 --> 00:59:28,233
[SPEAKER_07]: You get to use a prop.

881
00:59:29,133 --> 00:59:32,516
[SPEAKER_24]: So you know the initial D term in there.

882
00:59:32,937 --> 00:59:35,399
[SPEAKER_24]: You could actually call it I'd Piss because, you know.

883
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:41,264
[SPEAKER_24]: The initial D, Paradise Island, Sacktown Smackdown.

884
00:59:43,325 --> 00:59:43,666
[SPEAKER_24]: Two.

885
00:59:44,787 --> 00:59:45,307
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh my god.

886
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:46,740
[SPEAKER_23]: Whatever.

887
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:48,021
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, I'm done with the piss jokes.

888
00:59:49,061 --> 00:59:49,581
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm sorry.

889
00:59:49,621 --> 00:59:52,663
[SPEAKER_23]: We will bury the piss jokes, but you have to admit, it's funny.

890
00:59:52,883 --> 00:59:55,044
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

891
00:59:55,324 --> 00:59:58,445
[SPEAKER_07]: I never expected it to be called that initials.

892
00:59:58,926 --> 00:59:59,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

893
01:00:00,206 --> 01:00:00,907
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

894
01:00:00,987 --> 01:00:01,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

895
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:02,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

896
01:00:02,767 --> 01:00:04,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, the last round is the routines.

897
01:00:05,329 --> 01:00:08,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep in mind that you can actually do a group routine if you wish to.

898
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:10,111
[SPEAKER_07]: For two group pissing.

899
01:00:11,912 --> 01:00:12,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, sorry, sorry.

900
01:00:12,932 --> 01:00:13,272
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

901
01:00:13,312 --> 01:00:13,712
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the last.

902
01:00:13,812 --> 01:00:14,613
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear that was the last.

903
01:00:14,673 --> 01:00:15,053
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

904
01:00:24,985 --> 01:00:27,688
[SPEAKER_16]: I come in from the bathroom and you're still talking about piss?

905
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:31,972
[SPEAKER_16]: What would you do without me to babysit you?

906
01:00:32,012 --> 01:00:38,178
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't be pissed off This show is so full of shit

907
01:00:39,548 --> 01:00:41,710
[SPEAKER_16]: Not tonight, it's full of pee.

908
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:45,513
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what you should give as refreshment to everybody at the tournament?

909
01:00:45,593 --> 01:00:46,613
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, okay, seriously?

910
01:00:46,674 --> 01:00:48,475
[SPEAKER_16]: No, no, no.

911
01:00:48,555 --> 01:00:51,077
[SPEAKER_16]: Red Bull and little plastic clear cups.

912
01:00:51,617 --> 01:00:52,858
[SPEAKER_16]: Because Red Bull looks like pee.

913
01:00:56,261 --> 01:00:57,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, this seriously has to stop.

914
01:00:59,824 --> 01:01:04,127
[SPEAKER_03]: When I said that this show went to the toilet, I wasn't literal, you guys.

915
01:01:05,088 --> 01:01:05,628
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you know.

916
01:01:06,966 --> 01:01:09,207
[SPEAKER_03]: And now our chat room is just going off.

917
01:01:13,487 --> 01:01:15,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, breathe in.

918
01:01:16,508 --> 01:01:21,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so February 5th is when it all goes down.

919
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:25,790
[SPEAKER_07]: It all goes down February 5th.

920
01:01:25,810 --> 01:01:30,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, by the way, there will be food supplied as well for those who enter the tournament.

921
01:01:30,871 --> 01:01:31,372
[SPEAKER_07]: And Red Bull.

922
01:01:32,592 --> 01:01:32,712
Yep.

923
01:01:34,528 --> 01:01:38,050
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, everyone, be sure to come out and PA with us.

924
01:01:41,091 --> 01:01:45,313
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, that was bad.

925
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:47,174
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we need a break.

926
01:01:49,255 --> 01:01:54,317
[SPEAKER_03]: In this break, we're going to hear some music that was in some various Japanese DDR releases.

927
01:01:54,717 --> 01:01:55,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the newer ones.

928
01:01:55,477 --> 01:02:00,059
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted an excuse to play Superstar and Paranoia Respect and some cool songs.

929
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:00,980
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to hear that.

930
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:07,104
[SPEAKER_03]: and then we're going to come back and we actually have some Bomani news I want to talk about when we come back, believe it or not.

931
01:02:07,464 --> 01:02:10,966
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually a new Bomani game being tested right now.

932
01:02:11,827 --> 01:02:13,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it the DDR with Mario?

933
01:02:13,728 --> 01:02:14,089
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

934
01:02:14,149 --> 01:02:15,149
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about that last week.

935
01:02:15,169 --> 01:02:17,891
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no new details on DDR Mario yet unless I missed something.

936
01:02:17,911 --> 01:02:19,372
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll check to see if there's any new details on that.

937
01:02:19,672 --> 01:02:21,233
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another new one that's being tested right now.

938
01:02:21,253 --> 01:02:22,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to talk about that when we come back.

939
01:02:24,596 --> 01:02:27,658
[SPEAKER_03]: And we will... I'll do Aoi Shodown next break.

940
01:02:28,038 --> 01:02:28,358
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

941
01:02:28,438 --> 01:02:28,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

942
01:02:29,139 --> 01:02:31,060
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back after this with more

943
01:02:31,713 --> 01:02:33,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio

944
01:02:56,553 --> 01:03:04,760
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what it is that makes me feel like this I don't know who you are But you must be some kind of superstar

945
01:03:24,702 --> 01:03:27,283
[SPEAKER_13]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

946
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:52,405
[SPEAKER_13]: No matter where you are No matter where you are I don't know who you are I don't know who you are I don't know who you are I don't know who you are

947
01:05:33,684 --> 01:05:34,225
Thanks for watching!

948
01:06:16,394 --> 01:06:17,095
What's going on?

949
01:06:17,115 --> 01:06:17,795
What's going on?

950
01:06:58,155 --> 01:07:00,376
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching.

951
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:01,736
[SPEAKER_13]: See you next time.

952
01:07:31,864 --> 01:07:33,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio.

953
01:07:33,426 --> 01:07:35,587
[SPEAKER_03]: We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

954
01:07:42,413 --> 01:07:47,698
[SPEAKER_03]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, recovering a little bit during that break here, and we're back.

955
01:07:48,959 --> 01:07:52,022
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it's been kind of a slow week in the Bomani world.

956
01:07:52,082 --> 01:07:56,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a whole lot of news, but there was one pretty big thing.

957
01:07:57,418 --> 01:07:59,278
[SPEAKER_03]: That I thought was pretty interesting.

958
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:03,900
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's actually something that kind of, I don't know, it's been leaking around on various live journals out there.

959
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:06,880
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you're seeing it kind of pop up on DDR Freak as well.

960
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:09,281
[SPEAKER_03]: I know somebody had posted about it over there in the forums over there.

961
01:08:09,881 --> 01:08:14,722
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's actually a new game by Konami that's being tested right now.

962
01:08:15,222 --> 01:08:17,343
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a game called Dance 86.4.

963
01:08:19,443 --> 01:08:23,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I guess it's supposed to be some kind of radio station parody or something, you know?

964
01:08:23,284 --> 01:08:23,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

965
01:08:24,070 --> 01:08:36,358
[SPEAKER_16]: I think Raichan posted something about it in her live journal, and she posted a picture of the actual machine, and on the title she was like, Nuba Money Game?

966
01:08:36,498 --> 01:08:45,804
[SPEAKER_16]: And I saw it and I'm like, dang, that's pretty cool, except it was funny because one of her friends commented and said that the bars were smaller.

967
01:08:47,304 --> 01:08:49,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, this looks like a game that's obviously geared at kids.

968
01:08:49,585 --> 01:08:52,607
[SPEAKER_03]: I just posted a link in the chatroom if you guys hadn't seen this yet.

969
01:08:53,007 --> 01:08:56,289
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's some pictures, some full-length pictures you can bring up of what this game looks like.

970
01:08:56,989 --> 01:08:59,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks very kid-like.

971
01:08:59,350 --> 01:09:09,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you could say poppin' music-like, but then again, we all know poppin' music was a game that was kind of aimed at kids originally, and it's now quickly become, like, one of the tougher Bomani series.

972
01:09:09,316 --> 01:09:11,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Some would argue it's the toughest Bomani series, but that's, you know...

973
01:09:12,452 --> 01:09:13,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Something you could be argued about.

974
01:09:13,933 --> 01:09:17,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Has a very similar look to DDR, except I noticed this.

975
01:09:18,298 --> 01:09:18,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Three panels.

976
01:09:19,699 --> 01:09:20,059
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

977
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:21,481
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a left...

978
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:23,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Middle, right.

979
01:09:23,626 --> 01:09:26,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Which sort of reminds me of DDR Solo's three-panel mode, if you remember that.

980
01:09:26,987 --> 01:09:29,949
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, but DDR Solo had like a three-panel mode that was very similar.

981
01:09:30,729 --> 01:09:34,851
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see in these screenshots, you can see a little character there dancing.

982
01:09:35,391 --> 01:09:38,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks very similar to the DDR concept.

983
01:09:38,093 --> 01:09:42,875
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little hard to tell without some moving screenshots, but that's what we see right now.

984
01:09:43,215 --> 01:09:48,938
[SPEAKER_03]: And then these little miniature bars that this time, they're in the front as opposed to the back.

985
01:09:50,365 --> 01:09:55,026
[SPEAKER_03]: So why you have the bars in the front as opposed to the back, I have no idea, but that's the way it's built.

986
01:09:55,527 --> 01:09:57,407
[SPEAKER_03]: So, take that as you will.

987
01:09:57,787 --> 01:09:58,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Now here's the other interesting thing.

988
01:09:58,908 --> 01:10:06,410
[SPEAKER_03]: When looking at the song list, some of the early songs that are supposed to be in this, you'll notice there's a couple songs that were actually in DDR Festival that are showing up here.

989
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:10,171
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them being the Cutie Honey theme that was in DDR Festival.

990
01:10:10,531 --> 01:10:19,714
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of those are crossing over into this new Dance 86.4 game, which is very interesting, I must say.

991
01:10:20,405 --> 01:10:48,671
[SPEAKER_03]: and yeah, I'm being corrected in the chat room that the three panel solo mode was actually bottom was involved so you weren't just moving back and forth side to side like this one set up where three arrows are all next to each other it was kind of like you could do upper left or left and upper right or right and then bottom so you kind of had a little bit of different motion but this one is kind of like, I don't know I would think that the way you would dance to this would be more like a hoedown but obviously this is something that's written or being done for kids I don't know, we'll see

992
01:10:50,916 --> 01:10:52,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Any comment on this game?

993
01:10:52,778 --> 01:10:54,519
[SPEAKER_03]: The Dance 86.4 Funky Raider Station?

994
01:10:58,022 --> 01:11:02,886
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll have to... You know, I would think that they would have just done the Ohasta.

995
01:11:04,288 --> 01:11:05,368
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, kind of weird, huh?

996
01:11:05,569 --> 01:11:07,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you posted some more pictures there, didn't you, Loki?

997
01:11:08,351 --> 01:11:09,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, very cool.

998
01:11:10,533 --> 01:11:12,755
[SPEAKER_03]: What I think is kind of weird about this is that

999
01:11:14,518 --> 01:11:19,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of me is kind of scared because you hear that we are starting over with DDR Extreme.

1000
01:11:20,248 --> 01:11:21,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this starting over?

1001
01:11:22,557 --> 01:11:23,517
[SPEAKER_24]: This isn't even DDR.

1002
01:11:23,537 --> 01:11:24,778
[SPEAKER_24]: You're not even close.

1003
01:11:24,818 --> 01:11:26,638
[SPEAKER_24]: This is a spin-off of Bishi Bashi.

1004
01:11:26,658 --> 01:11:27,298
[SPEAKER_24]: That's all it is.

1005
01:11:27,718 --> 01:11:34,400
[SPEAKER_24]: It's just like they have the Bishi Bashi type dancing game thing that had three... It was exactly like this, except it wasn't on stage.

1006
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:36,140
[SPEAKER_24]: It was just on some stupid little pad.

1007
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:37,901
[SPEAKER_24]: They have it at AI.

1008
01:11:38,161 --> 01:11:39,801
[SPEAKER_24]: It's honestly, it's nothing new.

1009
01:11:39,841 --> 01:11:40,901
[SPEAKER_24]: It's nothing exciting.

1010
01:11:40,941 --> 01:11:43,062
[SPEAKER_24]: It's just like a new Bishi Bashi game.

1011
01:11:43,102 --> 01:11:47,243
[SPEAKER_24]: They actually had... There's some other shit I posted, too, in here that was kind of funny.

1012
01:11:48,163 --> 01:11:51,264
[SPEAKER_24]: There was... Where did I put it here?

1013
01:11:53,085 --> 01:11:55,708
[SPEAKER_24]: Um... Oh, this one right here.

1014
01:11:56,148 --> 01:11:57,909
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm all, looks like Banjo Freaks.

1015
01:11:58,230 --> 01:12:01,373
[SPEAKER_24]: And, you know, it's, um, some, like, banjo game thing.

1016
01:12:01,393 --> 01:12:04,295
[SPEAKER_24]: They have, like, a bunch of stuff that was on this one website here.

1017
01:12:05,456 --> 01:12:08,819
[SPEAKER_16]: Keep it alive, Namco came out with a whole bunch of music games I never saw.

1018
01:12:08,839 --> 01:12:10,000
[SPEAKER_24]: Location testing.

1019
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:16,145
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, like, yeah, they have the, um, this karaoke game, I think, that's actually, um...

1020
01:12:17,086 --> 01:12:23,670
[SPEAKER_24]: Idolmaster, another Namco music game that's coming out where you have to become a pop idol type thing.

1021
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:28,192
[SPEAKER_24]: Of course, Guitar Freaks V, they have stuff about that.

1022
01:12:28,752 --> 01:12:33,655
[SPEAKER_24]: And then Funky Radio Station Dance 86.4.

1023
01:12:35,956 --> 01:12:37,677
[SPEAKER_24]: But yeah, I don't know.

1024
01:12:37,697 --> 01:12:41,899
[SPEAKER_24]: It looks interesting, I guess.

1025
01:12:46,027 --> 01:12:52,151
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know, I can't help but feel a little bit of, come on guys, you gotta work on this game.

1026
01:12:52,171 --> 01:12:53,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's my new DDR?

1027
01:12:53,452 --> 01:12:53,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Where is it?

1028
01:12:54,252 --> 01:12:54,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Where?

1029
01:12:55,833 --> 01:12:59,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want this Dance 86.4, so I want DDR.

1030
01:12:59,755 --> 01:13:00,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's my DDR, Loki?

1031
01:13:04,124 --> 01:13:06,746
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh, you just got, um, Festival on me.

1032
01:13:06,866 --> 01:13:07,767
[SPEAKER_24]: Shit, what do you want?

1033
01:13:07,887 --> 01:13:08,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I want Arcade DDR!

1034
01:13:08,828 --> 01:13:12,570
[SPEAKER_03]: They can, they're, I can't believe they're making this whole new machine, this D&D 644.

1035
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:18,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and I understand, maybe there's a market for kid games and stuff, but, eh, it's frustrating.

1036
01:13:19,575 --> 01:13:22,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are they spending time on this when they could be making me a beautiful new DDR machine?

1037
01:13:24,658 --> 01:13:25,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Because this is cheaper.

1038
01:13:25,579 --> 01:13:28,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1039
01:13:28,681 --> 01:13:28,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

1040
01:13:31,463 --> 01:13:31,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

1041
01:13:33,646 --> 01:13:34,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, let's move on.

1042
01:13:36,287 --> 01:13:38,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what's going on in the sim scene right now, anything?

1043
01:13:40,728 --> 01:13:49,151
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, finally, finally, the sim files have been released for DDR Ultramix 2, Dancing Stage Fusion, and Festival.

1044
01:13:50,331 --> 01:13:52,952
[SPEAKER_24]: Finally, they're, well, done, I guess.

1045
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:53,592
[SPEAKER_24]: Um.

1046
01:13:54,298 --> 01:13:58,980
[SPEAKER_24]: They would be found at... Well, they have a preliminary thing up right now.

1047
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:02,102
[SPEAKER_24]: It's pretty much... I mean, they're as done as far as you and I are concerned.

1048
01:14:02,542 --> 01:14:07,585
[SPEAKER_24]: Because... I mean, oh no, they're missing the beginner steps on doubles.

1049
01:14:07,985 --> 01:14:08,825
[SPEAKER_11]: Woo!

1050
01:14:09,305 --> 01:14:10,026
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh my god!

1051
01:14:10,046 --> 01:14:11,867
[SPEAKER_24]: But other than that, it's perfectly fine.

1052
01:14:11,887 --> 01:14:12,867
[SPEAKER_24]: They have them all done.

1053
01:14:13,968 --> 01:14:18,650
[SPEAKER_24]: Including, I think, the first... No, not the first service pack.

1054
01:14:18,670 --> 01:14:20,271
[SPEAKER_24]: But everything else is done on it.

1055
01:14:20,491 --> 01:14:20,571
[SPEAKER_24]: Um...

1056
01:14:22,372 --> 01:14:32,517
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, I have a very long link I'll post later for where you can find these at, but check in DDRUK if you want to know.

1057
01:14:33,598 --> 01:14:41,602
[SPEAKER_24]: Keep up to date with their progress on SongPack 6 and 7, or 7, whatever the two new ones are.

1058
01:14:42,902 --> 01:14:44,403
[SPEAKER_24]: Because that's what's going to be happening there.

1059
01:14:44,923 --> 01:14:46,264
[SPEAKER_24]: DDR Maniacs is still down.

1060
01:14:46,504 --> 01:14:50,366
[SPEAKER_24]: Also, I think, I'm not sure if I mentioned it, because like I said, I can't remember...

1061
01:14:51,195 --> 01:14:56,858
[SPEAKER_24]: There was the Legend of Tak, the Gravity, DarkSakura, Burn Nation mix, and the Ecstasy 14 Hours Club mix, I believe.

1062
01:15:19,344 --> 01:15:20,865
[SPEAKER_24]: No, that was an older one.

1063
01:15:21,885 --> 01:15:22,945
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyways.

1064
01:15:23,986 --> 01:15:28,207
[SPEAKER_24]: So yeah, that's pretty much all that's going on right now, scene-wise.

1065
01:15:28,347 --> 01:15:35,690
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, that and Bomani's still talking about rolling out a site called Simulation Style, which I think is like Bomani Sims 2.0 type thing.

1066
01:15:36,530 --> 01:15:38,651
[SPEAKER_24]: That's supposedly coming out later on.

1067
01:15:40,652 --> 01:15:40,992
[SPEAKER_24]: That's it.

1068
01:15:43,793 --> 01:15:44,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Alrighty.

1069
01:15:45,834 --> 01:15:46,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, how you doing over there?

1070
01:15:48,476 --> 01:15:50,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything interesting going on on the forums over there?

1071
01:15:51,217 --> 01:16:01,061
[SPEAKER_16]: There isn't crap happening on DDR Freak right now Except someone PM'd me asking me what post-touring is Could you explain for the masses what post-touring is?

1072
01:16:01,321 --> 01:16:16,527
[SPEAKER_16]: When you post a whole bunch of stuff unnecessarily especially for people who post three damn times in a row instead of editing your post I consider that to be a version of post-touring Okay

1073
01:16:17,179 --> 01:16:21,201
[SPEAKER_16]: But, no, there's not really a whole major lot going on the forums.

1074
01:16:21,681 --> 01:16:23,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so, you know, slow news week.

1075
01:16:24,122 --> 01:16:24,722
[SPEAKER_16]: Slow news week.

1076
01:16:25,243 --> 01:16:26,143
[SPEAKER_16]: Slow everything.

1077
01:16:27,043 --> 01:16:30,545
[SPEAKER_16]: I think people are just trying to get adjusted to the new year, maybe.

1078
01:16:32,535 --> 01:16:38,623
[SPEAKER_03]: I think everybody's kind of sitting on things until E3, so we're in for a slow couple of months.

1079
01:16:39,163 --> 01:16:46,172
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, there is this stuff kind of brewing in Japan with DDR Mario and supposedly being showed at that show that's going on right now.

1080
01:16:46,212 --> 01:16:47,514
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised we haven't heard anything about it.

1081
01:16:47,814 --> 01:16:52,395
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it'll leak out on the net in the next few days, depending on what capacity this game's being shown in.

1082
01:16:53,155 --> 01:17:00,557
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, as far as these new games getting test locations and stuff, we'll just kind of have to get the news as we get it.

1083
01:17:01,237 --> 01:17:04,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, as far as American releases go, we're probably not going to hear anything until E3.

1084
01:17:04,558 --> 01:17:05,298
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be the big time.

1085
01:17:05,338 --> 01:17:12,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, if there is a new DDR game coming out this year, which I'm confident there's going to be, we won't get the details until E3.

1086
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:15,241
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we're in for a very interesting next few months.

1087
01:17:16,941 --> 01:17:17,201
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1088
01:17:17,588 --> 01:17:19,929
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys ready to have a cage match?

1089
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:22,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, please.

1090
01:17:23,151 --> 01:17:23,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, here we go.

1091
01:17:23,791 --> 01:17:24,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Launch Radio cage match.

1092
01:17:28,714 --> 01:17:33,316
[SPEAKER_03]: The way the cage match works, we play three songs for your listening pleasure.

1093
01:17:34,036 --> 01:17:44,862
[SPEAKER_03]: And the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Launch Radio Live's Vimani Music and More program, which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on this station when we're not here.

1094
01:17:46,986 --> 01:17:47,987
[SPEAKER_03]: The song is called Joe LaTaxi

1095
01:18:13,332 --> 01:18:19,481
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to participate in the cage match, you've got to be in our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on chat.

1096
01:18:19,961 --> 01:18:27,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is, song number one, Oria Posey, Joe LaTaxi, the Jan Wayne remix radio cut.

1097
01:18:27,912 --> 01:18:28,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy.

1098
01:19:44,099 --> 01:19:44,480
S, Actdeft

1099
01:20:43,931 --> 01:20:54,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Having mics on would help There it is, song number one tonight A clip of Joe LaTaxi Alright, will Joe LaTaxi win again?

1100
01:20:54,795 --> 01:21:01,958
[SPEAKER_03]: We shall find out But we have to put two new songs up against it And the next song comes from Loki Loki, what are you putting in tonight?

1101
01:21:02,759 --> 01:21:03,999
[SPEAKER_24]: Is it a remix of Girls?

1102
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:13,563
[SPEAKER_24]: No No, it's not a remix of Girls Because I haven't cut those down to size yet So that's the only reason why you're not getting Girls

1103
01:21:15,273 --> 01:21:22,655
[SPEAKER_24]: I will make a remix of that song if I have to in order to make another entry.

1104
01:21:24,015 --> 01:21:25,215
[SPEAKER_24]: But this is not gross.

1105
01:21:25,635 --> 01:21:34,837
[SPEAKER_24]: This is our favorite friend, MidiHead, and his debut track that is going to be on his next album that he demoed for the wonderful people on his website.

1106
01:21:34,897 --> 01:21:37,098
[SPEAKER_24]: Unfortunately, you have to buy something or be a member or whatever.

1107
01:21:38,058 --> 01:21:39,458
[SPEAKER_24]: So, this is exclusive.

1108
01:21:40,498 --> 01:21:41,419
[SPEAKER_24]: Not released yet.

1109
01:21:41,499 --> 01:21:41,899
[SPEAKER_24]: This is...

1110
01:21:44,529 --> 01:21:46,990
[SPEAKER_24]: This is Take Me Away by MidiHead.

1111
01:21:48,630 --> 01:21:49,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Does he know that you're doing this?

1112
01:21:50,930 --> 01:21:51,091
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1113
01:21:51,731 --> 01:21:55,271
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you're bootlegging... God, if we get a nasty letter, it's your ass.

1114
01:21:55,331 --> 01:21:56,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, here it is.

1115
01:21:57,232 --> 01:22:00,873
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm, you know... I'm creating buzz.

1116
01:22:01,253 --> 01:22:01,593
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1117
01:22:02,213 --> 01:22:02,473
[SPEAKER_24]: Buzz.

1118
01:22:03,873 --> 01:22:04,713
[SPEAKER_24]: Buzz is not bad.

1119
01:22:04,933 --> 01:22:05,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Buzz is good.

1120
01:22:07,754 --> 01:22:09,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's see what kind of buzz this generates.

1121
01:22:09,754 --> 01:22:10,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is.

1122
01:22:10,134 --> 01:22:11,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Song number two, MidiHead.

1123
01:22:11,895 --> 01:22:12,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Take Me Away.

1124
01:22:12,535 --> 01:22:12,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy.

1125
01:22:16,190 --> 01:22:29,635
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't you take me away from here Away from all this madness Take me away from here Away from all the madness

1126
01:25:28,455 --> 01:25:29,252
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

1127
01:26:38,956 --> 01:26:40,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go around and see what they thought.

1128
01:26:40,959 --> 01:26:41,659
[SPEAKER_03]: What we thought.

1129
01:26:42,681 --> 01:26:44,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me, Jamie, your thoughts.

1130
01:26:45,124 --> 01:26:45,604
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, Explicit.

1131
01:27:01,389 --> 01:27:03,311
[SPEAKER_07]: 7 from Explicit, Arcadian 6 from Arcadian, Loki Angel

1132
01:27:27,803 --> 01:27:33,419
[SPEAKER_16]: I really do like mom book stuff, so, and it was really kind of bouncy kind of thing.

1133
01:27:33,459 --> 01:27:33,640
[SPEAKER_16]: Eight.

1134
01:27:35,959 --> 01:27:37,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I like Monolithic quite a bit too.

1135
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:39,742
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he has a very distinct voice.

1136
01:27:40,062 --> 01:27:40,802
[SPEAKER_03]: It's different.

1137
01:27:41,323 --> 01:27:44,165
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not for everybody, but I don't know.

1138
01:27:44,665 --> 01:27:52,290
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing about that song for me is that I think he said this on his forums too, which is why I kind of gave Loki a funny look when he put this song in.

1139
01:27:52,370 --> 01:27:55,952
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he said the song isn't quite finished yet, that it's kind of still a work in progress.

1140
01:27:56,413 --> 01:27:56,793
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, it is.

1141
01:27:56,853 --> 01:27:57,353
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a demo.

1142
01:27:57,373 --> 01:28:01,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and see, it's got that demo feel to me, like it's missing...

1143
01:28:02,821 --> 01:28:04,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Something, there's something missing.

1144
01:28:04,442 --> 01:28:06,584
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't put my finger on it, but I'm not the musician.

1145
01:28:07,425 --> 01:28:09,146
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to figure out exactly what it is.

1146
01:28:09,586 --> 01:28:10,286
[SPEAKER_03]: But I like it.

1147
01:28:10,447 --> 01:28:11,727
[SPEAKER_03]: I like what I hear so far.

1148
01:28:12,208 --> 01:28:14,389
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely will pick up his next album when it comes out.

1149
01:28:14,870 --> 01:28:16,831
[SPEAKER_03]: If for no other reason than I just think he's a cool guy.

1150
01:28:17,231 --> 01:28:18,952
[SPEAKER_03]: So I give it an 8.

1151
01:28:19,893 --> 01:28:20,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so an 8 for me.

1152
01:28:22,855 --> 01:28:24,916
[SPEAKER_03]: And moving on, it's my turn to pick a song.

1153
01:28:24,956 --> 01:28:27,398
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really didn't want to do this tonight.

1154
01:28:27,718 --> 01:28:29,159
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not want to put this song in.

1155
01:28:29,199 --> 01:28:30,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Surprisingly enough, I didn't want to do this.

1156
01:28:31,241 --> 01:28:31,461
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

1157
01:28:32,552 --> 01:28:43,377
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I have been listening to nothing but this song non-stop this week that I would be doing myself a personal injustice to not put this song in the cage match tonight.

1158
01:28:45,058 --> 01:28:46,058
[SPEAKER_03]: And no, it's not girls.

1159
01:28:46,398 --> 01:28:46,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1160
01:28:48,035 --> 01:28:48,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

1161
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:11,701
Thanks for watching!

1162
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:32,461
Thanks for watching!

1163
01:31:41,784 --> 01:31:42,666
Thanks for watching!

1164
01:32:12,361 --> 01:32:13,483
[SPEAKER_13]: Get Bumped!

1165
01:34:05,652 --> 01:34:06,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that was song number three.

1166
01:34:07,753 --> 01:34:09,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Echo Image with Endless Day.

1167
01:34:09,934 --> 01:34:11,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's find out the scores.

1168
01:34:11,475 --> 01:34:11,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie.

1169
01:34:12,435 --> 01:34:13,396
[SPEAKER_16]: I actually really like that.

1170
01:34:13,876 --> 01:34:17,758
[SPEAKER_16]: Except I think his voice is just slightly over for that one.

1171
01:34:18,198 --> 01:34:19,419
[SPEAKER_16]: Like it's a little too loud.

1172
01:34:19,939 --> 01:34:23,981
[SPEAKER_16]: Because on the other ones I've heard he has a really nice blend with the music.

1173
01:34:25,162 --> 01:34:30,184
[SPEAKER_16]: Almost in Ben Halen's Sammy Hagar era type blending.

1174
01:34:30,945 --> 01:34:33,186
[SPEAKER_16]: This one I think is a little overpowering, so I give it a nine.

1175
01:34:33,926 --> 01:34:34,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, nine from Jamie.

1176
01:34:34,867 --> 01:34:35,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Explicit.

1177
01:34:37,574 --> 01:34:38,495
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually like the song.

1178
01:34:38,515 --> 01:34:42,138
[SPEAKER_07]: I give it like an 8.5.

1179
01:34:43,099 --> 01:34:47,723
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's something about it that just makes it far from perfect in a way.

1180
01:34:48,243 --> 01:34:49,084
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very great song.

1181
01:34:49,104 --> 01:34:52,426
[SPEAKER_07]: It has a lot of originality and variation.

1182
01:34:53,367 --> 01:34:54,468
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very good music.

1183
01:34:54,748 --> 01:34:56,030
[SPEAKER_07]: It has an all-ticket cutter.

1184
01:34:57,871 --> 01:34:59,132
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1185
01:34:59,272 --> 01:35:03,756
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the pauses is what kills the song.

1186
01:35:03,876 --> 01:35:04,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a big fan of pauses.

1187
01:35:05,376 --> 01:35:08,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I like some of the positive, but it looks like it's done wrong in a way.

1188
01:35:08,998 --> 01:35:09,538
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure.

1189
01:35:10,218 --> 01:35:12,099
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't feel like it's something appealing.

1190
01:35:12,660 --> 01:35:12,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1191
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:14,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than that, it's a very good song.

1192
01:35:14,721 --> 01:35:14,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1193
01:35:15,441 --> 01:35:15,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Fair enough.

1194
01:35:15,821 --> 01:35:16,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Arcadian.

1195
01:35:16,742 --> 01:35:17,102
[SPEAKER_07]: That's good.

1196
01:35:17,122 --> 01:35:17,682
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll give it an 8.

1197
01:35:18,382 --> 01:35:18,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

1198
01:35:20,383 --> 01:35:21,464
[SPEAKER_03]: I give it a 10 because it's awesome.

1199
01:35:22,865 --> 01:35:23,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Angel.

1200
01:35:23,445 --> 01:35:26,606
[SPEAKER_16]: 10 because it's Echo Image and it's still awesome.

1201
01:35:28,187 --> 01:35:31,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, me, my opinion, in my opinion...

1202
01:35:32,540 --> 01:35:35,342
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, that song is perfection.

1203
01:35:35,722 --> 01:35:42,827
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is the first true 10 I would give to any song in the past 120 episodes that we've done this K-Dimension.

1204
01:35:43,207 --> 01:35:43,447
[SPEAKER_03]: To me.

1205
01:35:44,668 --> 01:35:44,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1206
01:35:47,310 --> 01:35:47,670
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

1207
01:35:47,730 --> 01:35:48,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1208
01:35:48,511 --> 01:35:49,732
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for you guys to vote.

1209
01:35:50,292 --> 01:35:55,315
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to place your votes in a minute here after this quick recap of the three songs you can vote for tonight.

1210
01:35:55,395 --> 01:35:57,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Song number one, Jolitaxi.

1211
01:36:08,961 --> 01:36:12,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Song number two, Midi Head, Take Me Away.

1212
01:36:22,548 --> 01:36:25,230
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm picking really bad clips of the songs tonight, I'm sorry guys.

1213
01:36:25,530 --> 01:36:28,111
[SPEAKER_03]: And song number three, Echo Image, Endless Day.

1214
01:36:29,131 --> 01:36:30,532
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I had my reasons after all

1215
01:36:38,187 --> 01:36:40,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, place vote now.

1216
01:36:41,009 --> 01:36:47,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote for song number 1, 2, or 3.

1217
01:36:48,354 --> 01:36:58,641
[SPEAKER_03]: You can call them Joe LaTaxi, Take Me Away, Endless Day, Echo Image, Midi Head, and if you can pronounce the other one, that's fine by me too.

1218
01:36:59,301 --> 01:37:00,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever will get the message across.

1219
01:37:00,922 --> 01:37:01,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on.

1220
01:37:02,873 --> 01:37:03,794
[SPEAKER_03]: More stuff going on.

1221
01:37:03,854 --> 01:37:07,797
[SPEAKER_03]: So when it is a slow news week, I like to go around and I like to browse some of the forums.

1222
01:37:08,138 --> 01:37:12,381
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like to be inspired by certain topics that are going on in some of the various web forums.

1223
01:37:12,441 --> 01:37:15,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, one of the largest being DDR Freak.

1224
01:37:15,324 --> 01:37:19,728
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, we like DDR Freak because not only do we have a host who happens to be a moderator there.

1225
01:37:20,709 --> 01:37:21,389
[SPEAKER_16]: I wonder who that is.

1226
01:37:22,190 --> 01:37:22,690
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's you.

1227
01:37:23,431 --> 01:37:24,472
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I forgot.

1228
01:37:25,453 --> 01:37:27,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Our webmaster is a moderator there.

1229
01:37:27,975 --> 01:37:28,235
[SPEAKER_03]: And then...

1230
01:37:29,537 --> 01:37:31,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Several of our frequent guests are moderators there.

1231
01:37:32,119 --> 01:37:33,079
[SPEAKER_16]: One's an admin.

1232
01:37:33,279 --> 01:37:33,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there you go.

1233
01:37:33,980 --> 01:37:35,621
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we get rerun.

1234
01:37:35,661 --> 01:37:36,462
[SPEAKER_16]: The admin.

1235
01:37:36,622 --> 01:37:39,403
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we are a small part of DDR Freak.

1236
01:37:39,463 --> 01:37:49,330
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to bring the site down with our dumb little show we do, which you can hear Friday nights at 6 o'clock over on DDR Freak Radio, which is a cool station.

1237
01:37:49,350 --> 01:37:49,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Check it out.

1238
01:37:50,661 --> 01:37:53,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you wish you had a girlfriend that played DDR?

1239
01:37:53,343 --> 01:37:57,065
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like every guy I know's dream to have a girl that will play DDR and actually be good.

1240
01:38:17,972 --> 01:38:19,753
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on, wouldn't that just be awesome?

1241
01:38:20,153 --> 01:38:22,675
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, except for the part where she steals all the glory or whatnot.

1242
01:38:25,537 --> 01:38:27,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't that be cool to have a girlfriend that plays DDR?

1243
01:38:28,358 --> 01:38:28,638
[SPEAKER_24]: Loki.

1244
01:38:28,678 --> 01:38:30,740
[SPEAKER_24]: There goes another F you.

1245
01:38:31,100 --> 01:38:34,022
[SPEAKER_24]: Wouldn't it be awesome to actually touch a real girl?

1246
01:38:38,384 --> 01:38:39,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Wouldn't it be awesome to get laid?

1247
01:38:40,826 --> 01:38:44,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Wouldn't it be awesome to rape a woman instead of a freaking bar?

1248
01:38:44,107 --> 01:38:44,147
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1249
01:38:45,608 --> 01:38:45,848
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

1250
01:38:46,149 --> 01:38:46,329
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1251
01:38:48,030 --> 01:38:48,590
[SPEAKER_16]: Not at all.

1252
01:38:51,052 --> 01:38:52,813
[SPEAKER_24]: God, this is sad.

1253
01:38:54,054 --> 01:38:55,535
[SPEAKER_24]: Someday I'll get laid!

1254
01:38:57,897 --> 01:39:01,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, don't you wish you had a girlfriend that played DDR?

1255
01:39:02,860 --> 01:39:03,541
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I don't know.

1256
01:39:03,561 --> 01:39:04,942
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to ask my fiancé.

1257
01:39:07,404 --> 01:39:09,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, surely you must have some kind of comment on this.

1258
01:39:11,206 --> 01:39:11,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me look here.

1259
01:39:11,727 --> 01:39:13,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me find that quote again.

1260
01:39:14,428 --> 01:39:16,450
[SPEAKER_03]: To have a girl that will play DDR...

1261
01:39:17,034 --> 01:39:18,215
[SPEAKER_04]: and actually be good!

1262
01:39:21,336 --> 01:39:22,477
[SPEAKER_16]: I wouldn't know anything about that.

1263
01:39:25,138 --> 01:39:28,160
[SPEAKER_03]: So are you saying that there's no girls that are actually good at DDR out there?

1264
01:39:29,761 --> 01:39:30,741
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, of course we are.

1265
01:39:31,522 --> 01:39:36,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though you can pass CATAs and... You know what?

1266
01:39:38,065 --> 01:39:42,087
[SPEAKER_16]: My comment is completely off the record as we are probably being recorded by a few people.

1267
01:39:42,327 --> 01:39:43,028
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, fine.

1268
01:39:43,588 --> 01:39:43,828
[SPEAKER_16]: But...

1269
01:39:44,525 --> 01:39:47,988
[SPEAKER_16]: That's probably the most dumb thread I've ever freaking heard of in my life.

1270
01:39:48,008 --> 01:39:52,111
[SPEAKER_16]: That's almost as dumb as show off your cell phone.

1271
01:39:53,332 --> 01:39:54,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is going on a random chat right now.

1272
01:39:54,733 --> 01:39:57,635
[SPEAKER_07]: This has turned out to be a dumbass, dumbass revolution.

1273
01:39:58,416 --> 01:40:03,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hey, you know, the guy just wants a girlfriend that I can sort of see.

1274
01:40:04,300 --> 01:40:08,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't we want to date people that have similar interests sometimes?

1275
01:40:08,423 --> 01:40:12,627
[SPEAKER_07]: But you've got people like DJ Ness saying, ooh, is there any hot girls in NorCal?

1276
01:40:13,247 --> 01:40:14,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Or shit like this.

1277
01:40:15,367 --> 01:40:16,808
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, you know what?

1278
01:40:17,289 --> 01:40:19,551
[SPEAKER_03]: There are no girls in NorCal, actually.

1279
01:40:19,591 --> 01:40:20,331
[SPEAKER_03]: We should tell them that.

1280
01:40:20,351 --> 01:40:21,372
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually no girls here.

1281
01:40:21,652 --> 01:40:23,553
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one big gay bar, actually.

1282
01:40:24,674 --> 01:40:26,115
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not responding to this.

1283
01:40:27,016 --> 01:40:29,518
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, why would they even ask?

1284
01:40:29,578 --> 01:40:30,959
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there any hotties in NorCal?

1285
01:40:30,999 --> 01:40:32,740
[SPEAKER_24]: Like, they're gonna talk to you, sure.

1286
01:40:35,082 --> 01:40:37,964
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, if you gotta ask, they're not gonna talk.

1287
01:40:39,425 --> 01:40:40,506
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, really, really.

1288
01:40:41,105 --> 01:40:41,225
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh!

1289
01:40:41,445 --> 01:40:42,526
[SPEAKER_24]: Someone's looking for Hotties!

1290
01:40:42,766 --> 01:40:43,906
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe I'll go date him!

1291
01:40:44,226 --> 01:40:45,006
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, really.

1292
01:40:45,667 --> 01:40:47,967
[SPEAKER_16]: Cause I really go to an arcade to pick up dates.

1293
01:40:48,567 --> 01:40:49,468
[SPEAKER_24]: I drive a ricer!

1294
01:40:49,748 --> 01:40:50,368
[SPEAKER_24]: I am pimp!

1295
01:40:50,928 --> 01:40:51,528
[SPEAKER_24]: Date me!

1296
01:40:52,689 --> 01:40:54,069
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh my gosh.

1297
01:40:54,869 --> 01:40:57,390
[SPEAKER_24]: Allow me to spread my seed and genes!

1298
01:40:58,411 --> 01:41:01,892
[SPEAKER_24]: So that we'll be able to create the ultimate dancing person.

1299
01:41:02,372 --> 01:41:03,712
[SPEAKER_24]: Who, yes, will not get laid.

1300
01:41:08,974 --> 01:41:09,254
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyways.

1301
01:41:10,959 --> 01:41:13,321
[SPEAKER_07]: So, not responding to this.

1302
01:41:13,902 --> 01:41:14,862
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, actually I did.

1303
01:41:15,022 --> 01:41:16,984
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually went in the thread and I responded.

1304
01:41:17,685 --> 01:41:18,505
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually responded.

1305
01:41:19,106 --> 01:41:20,667
[SPEAKER_03]: And here was my response down here.

1306
01:41:22,669 --> 01:41:25,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, I don't really want a girlfriend that plays DDR.

1307
01:41:25,651 --> 01:41:27,793
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it would be cool to have a boyfriend that plays DDR though.

1308
01:41:30,215 --> 01:41:31,116
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my response.

1309
01:41:31,816 --> 01:41:32,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Angel, any feedback?

1310
01:41:34,419 --> 01:41:35,960
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, considering...

1311
01:41:37,021 --> 01:41:39,923
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I'm going to have to switch this around.

1312
01:41:40,883 --> 01:41:51,128
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, at one point I did, uh, want to find a guy to play DR, but, you know, that's kind of, I suppose it's kind of easy because it's all guys, but, hey, it kind of happened, so, you know.

1313
01:41:53,469 --> 01:41:59,533
[SPEAKER_16]: Miraculously, yay, okay, um, so, whatever, you know.

1314
01:42:01,053 --> 01:42:01,494
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, gee.

1315
01:42:03,114 --> 01:42:04,675
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, yeah, whatever.

1316
01:42:05,536 --> 01:42:06,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so,

1317
01:42:08,304 --> 01:42:09,324
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1318
01:42:09,364 --> 01:42:11,365
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to give this guy a little credit here.

1319
01:42:11,445 --> 01:42:12,425
[SPEAKER_03]: He's probably young.

1320
01:42:14,306 --> 01:42:17,487
[SPEAKER_03]: But we see these threads all over the freaking forum.

1321
01:42:17,567 --> 01:42:18,147
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I know.

1322
01:42:18,187 --> 01:42:19,228
[SPEAKER_03]: But let me give you guys some advice.

1323
01:42:20,288 --> 01:42:25,990
[SPEAKER_03]: People assume that they want to date somebody that has similar interests with them so that they can go out and do stuff together.

1324
01:42:26,010 --> 01:42:26,470
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

1325
01:42:26,790 --> 01:42:32,092
[SPEAKER_03]: But remember, guys, your interests don't always have to match up 100% for a successful relationship.

1326
01:42:32,132 --> 01:42:33,933
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I've been in relationships where

1327
01:42:34,611 --> 01:42:36,572
[SPEAKER_03]: We weren't alike at all, okay?

1328
01:42:37,012 --> 01:42:43,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, we were not even into the same types of things, but part of the relationship was learning about each other's interests.

1329
01:42:43,813 --> 01:42:56,577
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think as long as your potential partner is open to the idea of, you know, hey, you play a dancing video game, you know, as long as maybe your potential partner watches a soap opera that you think is stupid.

1330
01:42:57,139 --> 01:42:57,899
[SPEAKER_03]: but they watch it every day.

1331
01:42:57,939 --> 01:43:00,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you've got to be kind of open to that and kind of see it from their perspective.

1332
01:43:00,741 --> 01:43:04,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Part about relationship is kind of learning from each other, I think.

1333
01:43:04,602 --> 01:43:07,083
[SPEAKER_03]: You're never going to find anybody that's 100% just like you.

1334
01:43:07,544 --> 01:43:10,245
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we all want to fuck ourselves, but let's face it.

1335
01:43:10,265 --> 01:43:12,066
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know about that, Scott.

1336
01:43:12,106 --> 01:43:13,986
[SPEAKER_07]: That's sick.

1337
01:43:14,086 --> 01:43:14,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm kidding.

1338
01:43:15,247 --> 01:43:19,729
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I mean, opposites attract and that's all I have to say.

1339
01:43:22,053 --> 01:43:23,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't you guys agree with me, though?

1340
01:43:23,774 --> 01:43:24,735
[SPEAKER_07]: I totally agree.

1341
01:43:24,755 --> 01:43:27,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no problem.

1342
01:43:27,817 --> 01:43:31,439
[SPEAKER_07]: You can settle your differences and make sure you understand each other in a way.

1343
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,142
[SPEAKER_16]: The main thing is communication, though.

1344
01:43:35,182 --> 01:43:35,842
[SPEAKER_16]: We all know that.

1345
01:43:37,543 --> 01:43:39,465
[SPEAKER_04]: That reminds me of that old Paula Abdul song.

1346
01:43:39,685 --> 01:43:41,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Two steps forward, two steps back.

1347
01:43:41,866 --> 01:43:43,847
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember that.

1348
01:43:44,228 --> 01:43:50,892
[SPEAKER_24]: And I have no career and I'm on a stupid show that makes fun of people that suck.

1349
01:43:51,738 --> 01:43:52,338
[SPEAKER_08]: She begs!

1350
01:43:52,379 --> 01:43:53,059
[SPEAKER_08]: She begs!

1351
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:58,123
[SPEAKER_24]: God, Paula Abdul, so... Last century.

1352
01:44:04,127 --> 01:44:05,128
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, anyways.

1353
01:44:06,629 --> 01:44:07,169
[SPEAKER_24]: That's lame.

1354
01:44:07,209 --> 01:44:08,971
[SPEAKER_24]: Why do people start threads like that, really?

1355
01:44:09,851 --> 01:44:10,952
[SPEAKER_24]: Go talk to real people.

1356
01:44:12,193 --> 01:44:14,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop using forums.

1357
01:44:16,276 --> 01:44:20,079
[SPEAKER_24]: Why don't you stop wondering about girls and go discover what girls really are?

1358
01:44:21,678 --> 01:44:27,343
[SPEAKER_03]: What if we didn't have that luxury of living in a somewhat big town and being able to go to the arcade and find people like us?

1359
01:44:27,363 --> 01:44:31,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we all met, like it or not, we all met playing DDR, right?

1360
01:44:31,946 --> 01:44:32,667
[SPEAKER_03]: That is true.

1361
01:44:32,767 --> 01:44:35,749
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, maybe we've got a luxury this guy doesn't have.

1362
01:44:37,151 --> 01:44:37,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Comment?

1363
01:44:39,472 --> 01:44:40,193
[SPEAKER_16]: We're special.

1364
01:44:41,334 --> 01:44:42,975
[SPEAKER_16]: I told you you were so talented.

1365
01:44:43,916 --> 01:44:51,262
[SPEAKER_16]: And on top of that, you want to know, I actually met Dan online through anime and video games.

1366
01:44:52,293 --> 01:44:54,134
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can find love on a forum.

1367
01:44:55,134 --> 01:44:58,915
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I didn't know what the fuck a forum was when I first went online.

1368
01:44:58,975 --> 01:45:00,975
[SPEAKER_16]: It was just someone my roommates knew.

1369
01:45:01,235 --> 01:45:02,736
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll tell you how I found everything.

1370
01:45:02,996 --> 01:45:04,016
[SPEAKER_24]: It's basically like this.

1371
01:45:04,476 --> 01:45:12,318
[SPEAKER_24]: I was bored, so I read the manual for DDR, USA, or whatever, and in the back it gave special credits to DDRFreak.com.

1372
01:45:12,918 --> 01:45:19,880
[SPEAKER_24]: Then in turn I went to DDRFreak.com, found that, found the regional forums, found the link to the Sacramento's webpage, joined their forums,

1373
01:45:20,359 --> 01:45:22,180
[SPEAKER_24]: Found a meetup and then went there.

1374
01:45:23,861 --> 01:45:25,422
[SPEAKER_24]: That's basically the whole chain of events.

1375
01:45:27,784 --> 01:45:38,230
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I'm hearing this right, you're suggesting maybe what this guy ought to do is if he wants to find the girl that's into DDR, go to a meetup in your area where there are going to be people playing DDR, boys and girls.

1376
01:45:38,630 --> 01:45:41,872
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's going to be 20 smelly guys all fighting over that one girl.

1377
01:45:42,853 --> 01:45:46,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, go Friday night, Saturday night, or even into a tournament.

1378
01:45:47,555 --> 01:45:49,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, go to your local tournament.

1379
01:45:49,597 --> 01:45:49,997
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1380
01:45:50,467 --> 01:45:52,268
[SPEAKER_07]: If someone dares to even organize one.

1381
01:45:53,169 --> 01:45:55,590
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's hard to say because I don't know where this guy lives.

1382
01:45:57,851 --> 01:45:58,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1383
01:45:59,312 --> 01:46:05,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, we're going to go to... I was going to say we're going to go to a break, but I think we're going to go to find out who won tonight's cage match.

1384
01:46:07,257 --> 01:46:08,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Who do you guys think won tonight's cage match?

1385
01:46:10,158 --> 01:46:12,700
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that Taku won with Holic.

1386
01:46:14,241 --> 01:46:18,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Taku did get another few votes tonight for Holic, but unfortunately we throw those out and shred them.

1387
01:46:18,523 --> 01:46:19,604
[SPEAKER_16]: Eventually he's going to win.

1388
01:46:20,231 --> 01:46:21,772
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you guys think won?

1389
01:46:21,852 --> 01:46:22,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Any guesses?

1390
01:46:22,712 --> 01:46:30,815
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm guessing... Echo Image, maybe?

1391
01:46:31,796 --> 01:46:36,657
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I was going to guess Echo Image, even though Midi Head's pretty cool.

1392
01:46:37,278 --> 01:46:39,218
[SPEAKER_16]: And Jamie's pick is also cool.

1393
01:46:40,459 --> 01:46:42,120
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I'm still going to guess Echo Image.

1394
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:48,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's find out... What, Logie?

1395
01:46:49,178 --> 01:46:49,398
[SPEAKER_24]: Nothing.

1396
01:46:49,418 --> 01:46:50,899
[SPEAKER_24]: I was just quoting them all.

1397
01:46:50,919 --> 01:46:58,905
[SPEAKER_24]: Imagine how it would be to be at the top making cash money to touring all around the world telling stories about young girls.

1398
01:47:01,787 --> 01:47:02,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1399
01:47:02,668 --> 01:47:02,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1400
01:47:03,349 --> 01:47:03,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is.

1401
01:47:03,849 --> 01:47:07,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight's winner of the Orange Launch Radio Cage Match by one vote.

1402
01:47:08,312 --> 01:47:11,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Only one vote made this song win.

1403
01:47:11,034 --> 01:47:11,715
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always one vote.

1404
01:47:11,735 --> 01:47:12,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is.

1405
01:47:12,075 --> 01:47:12,716
[SPEAKER_03]: By one vote...

1406
01:47:18,579 --> 01:47:22,121
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a new champion, Echo Image with Endless Day.

1407
01:47:22,881 --> 01:47:24,442
[SPEAKER_03]: One vote over Jolitaxi.

1408
01:47:24,922 --> 01:47:28,824
[SPEAKER_24]: Why am I not surprised?

1409
01:47:28,864 --> 01:47:30,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Very close vote, very close vote.

1410
01:47:30,565 --> 01:47:34,627
[SPEAKER_03]: And MidiHead picked up quite a few votes of his own too, but one vote over Jolitaxi.

1411
01:47:34,687 --> 01:47:36,948
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you think your vote doesn't make a difference, woohoo.

1412
01:47:37,208 --> 01:47:38,548
[SPEAKER_15]: I already know what I'm going to pick.

1413
01:47:38,568 --> 01:47:41,030
[SPEAKER_15]: The chatroom knows what I'm going to pick too.

1414
01:47:41,050 --> 01:47:41,990
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what I'm going to pick.

1415
01:47:43,564 --> 01:47:43,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue Impulse

1416
01:48:12,435 --> 01:48:12,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Ali Shuttle

1417
01:49:58,634 --> 01:49:59,100
Thank you.

1418
01:50:31,623 --> 01:50:33,104
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1419
01:51:25,712 --> 01:51:30,513
I want your everything Every night I'll give you everything I want you I want you I want you

1420
01:53:16,116 --> 01:53:16,677
and many more.

1421
01:54:10,929 --> 01:54:11,972
Thanks for watching!

1422
01:55:05,683 --> 01:55:06,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1423
01:55:07,264 --> 01:55:09,425
[SPEAKER_03]: We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

1424
01:55:14,847 --> 01:55:22,871
[SPEAKER_03]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening as we are usually here every Sunday night from 6.30pm to 9.30pm Pacific Standard Time.

1425
01:55:23,131 --> 01:55:25,092
[SPEAKER_03]: I was being such a camera whore during the break too.

1426
01:55:25,112 --> 01:55:25,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see that?

1427
01:55:25,692 --> 01:55:26,793
[SPEAKER_16]: I might get on the cam.

1428
01:55:27,682 --> 01:55:29,624
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1429
01:55:52,702 --> 01:55:54,883
[SPEAKER_16]: I wanted to go to Fanime, but I want to cosplay this year.

1430
01:55:55,223 --> 01:56:00,085
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, that would be a good way to... I'm thinking about making an idea I had a while back.

1431
01:56:00,185 --> 01:56:02,946
[SPEAKER_03]: We should write the Fanime people and get one of those lecture things.

1432
01:56:03,026 --> 01:56:04,587
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to make a white mage outfit.

1433
01:56:04,927 --> 01:56:05,727
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be awesome.

1434
01:56:06,688 --> 01:56:08,228
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be cool.

1435
01:56:08,529 --> 01:56:09,749
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go as a warrior.

1436
01:56:10,069 --> 01:56:11,330
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go as a warrior in Subligar.

1437
01:56:11,350 --> 01:56:13,731
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to do the Yuna 10-2 white mage outfit.

1438
01:56:14,671 --> 01:56:15,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, now that's cool.

1439
01:56:15,391 --> 01:56:16,292
[SPEAKER_16]: That one was really neat.

1440
01:56:16,732 --> 01:56:17,272
[SPEAKER_16]: Those boots.

1441
01:56:18,353 --> 01:56:21,794
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely want to do the warrior in Subligar, though.

1442
01:56:24,861 --> 01:56:25,461
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh-huh?

1443
01:56:26,082 --> 01:56:26,522
[SPEAKER_04]: When is what?

1444
01:56:27,223 --> 01:56:30,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Fanime is usually... Loki, isn't Fanime usually around Memorial Day weekend?

1445
01:56:31,406 --> 01:56:34,248
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, it was actually on Memorial Day weekend last year.

1446
01:56:35,169 --> 01:56:39,432
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, I remember Fanime was only like a week after E3 last year, and I was so tired.

1447
01:56:39,592 --> 01:56:41,053
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have to talk to the Fanime people, though.

1448
01:56:41,153 --> 01:56:43,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think we're good enough to get our own little lecture thing?

1449
01:56:43,295 --> 01:56:44,436
[SPEAKER_16]: We are hot, okay?

1450
01:56:44,496 --> 01:56:45,316
[SPEAKER_16]: We're hot shit!

1451
01:56:46,297 --> 01:56:49,400
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, honestly, honestly, they had Tanpopo Arcade there.

1452
01:56:50,440 --> 01:56:51,821
[SPEAKER_24]: Do you remember what Tanpopo Arcade was?

1453
01:56:51,841 --> 01:56:52,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1454
01:56:52,402 --> 01:56:52,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1455
01:56:53,686 --> 01:56:54,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Question answered.

1456
01:56:54,406 --> 01:56:54,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

1457
01:56:54,807 --> 01:56:55,407
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Angel.

1458
01:56:56,087 --> 01:56:58,349
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll go if somebody wants to kidnap me for a weekend.

1459
01:56:58,629 --> 01:56:59,709
[SPEAKER_16]: That sounded really bad.

1460
01:56:59,870 --> 01:57:00,130
[SPEAKER_16]: Oops.

1461
01:57:01,511 --> 01:57:04,712
[SPEAKER_16]: Fanime is May 27th, 28th, 29th, and 30th.

1462
01:57:06,233 --> 01:57:10,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I know, okay, everybody in the chat room is going, why Fanime?

1463
01:57:10,376 --> 01:57:12,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Come to our local convention on the East Coast.

1464
01:57:12,277 --> 01:57:13,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Anime Expo sucks.

1465
01:57:15,639 --> 01:57:16,699
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not Fanime Expo.

1466
01:57:16,719 --> 01:57:19,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's the fact that Fanime we can drive to.

1467
01:57:19,301 --> 01:57:21,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we can all pile in the OLR van.

1468
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:50,486
[SPEAKER_03]: that doesn't exist except in my imagination but we can pile in the mystery machine which is the OLR van and go whereas to go to the east coast costs money that we don't have until we become rich and famous so we'll see that's what you can do E3 is the weekend before if you want to see us at your east coast con help us be rich and famous send us money E3 is the weekend before alright we'll see

1469
01:57:51,212 --> 01:57:53,194
[SPEAKER_03]: We would love to come to more conventions, honestly.

1470
01:57:53,254 --> 01:57:56,376
[SPEAKER_03]: We will whore ourselves out to anybody that wants to have us.

1471
01:57:57,357 --> 01:57:58,578
[SPEAKER_16]: We could try Pacific Coast Con.

1472
01:57:58,698 --> 01:58:00,420
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll even fly southwest.

1473
01:58:00,940 --> 01:58:01,961
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're not picky.

1474
01:58:02,001 --> 01:58:03,722
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll fly southwest and stay in a Motel 6.

1475
01:58:05,063 --> 01:58:08,326
[SPEAKER_16]: There's the one that the people who originally started AX do now.

1476
01:58:08,346 --> 01:58:10,808
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's like Pacific Coast Con or something.

1477
01:58:11,709 --> 01:58:15,131
[SPEAKER_16]: That basically is back to what AX originally was before it got stupid.

1478
01:58:17,153 --> 01:58:18,454
[SPEAKER_16]: And here's a pretty good con.

1479
01:58:18,634 --> 01:58:19,795
[SPEAKER_16]: We could do Yowie Con.

1480
01:58:20,296 --> 01:58:20,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot.

1481
01:58:20,676 --> 01:58:20,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot.

1482
01:58:21,494 --> 01:58:26,201
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh my god, we should do YaoiCon and go all like, like, J-Rock style.

1483
01:58:26,662 --> 01:58:29,506
[SPEAKER_16]: You just made me blink and run away, but maybe that's a good thing.

1484
01:58:30,788 --> 01:58:31,989
[SPEAKER_16]: YaoiCon's supposed to be fun.

1485
01:58:32,070 --> 01:58:33,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, wouldn't you want to do YaoiCon?

1486
01:58:34,894 --> 01:58:36,396
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh yeah, look at me all excited.

1487
01:58:39,815 --> 01:58:43,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I think what we'll do now is actually we're going to open up our Skype line for some feedback.

1488
01:58:43,837 --> 01:58:46,219
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys want to call our show, we're going to do that.

1489
01:58:46,279 --> 01:58:50,801
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to open up the Skype line right now for you guys to be able to call into our show and have a chat with us.

1490
01:58:51,742 --> 01:58:54,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, in the meantime, I know you wanted to talk about something that's going on.

1491
01:58:54,664 --> 01:58:59,767
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking about LiveJournal a little bit before, and I know you've got a new little project going on over there, so go ahead and plug away.

1492
01:59:00,367 --> 01:59:06,110
[SPEAKER_16]: Over on LiveJournal, I've made a community called GeekFit, G-E-E-K-S-I-T.

1493
01:59:06,671 --> 01:59:08,992
[SPEAKER_16]: For anybody who was wanting to

1494
01:59:09,562 --> 01:59:12,105
[SPEAKER_16]: Have feedback on getting in better shape.

1495
01:59:13,107 --> 01:59:22,538
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a few of us on there right now, basically just like a big support group for each other, sharing tips, asking about exercise, different things that are helping all of us.

1496
01:59:22,639 --> 01:59:27,404
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you're interested in bettering yourself, then join up.

1497
01:59:27,665 --> 01:59:28,386
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what we're for.

1498
01:59:30,816 --> 01:59:31,837
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1499
01:59:51,121 --> 01:59:51,782
[SPEAKER_03]: DDRs and Means for Exercise

1500
02:00:11,385 --> 02:00:17,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, there's more to, though, you wouldn't, you know, somebody wants to join this community and talk about how DDR is their exercise program.

1501
02:00:17,808 --> 02:00:23,210
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool and all, but what are some other alternatives that you guys would be encouraging over in the GeekFit community?

1502
02:00:25,031 --> 02:00:29,533
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, it's more or less just leaning more toward healthy attitudes.

1503
02:00:30,494 --> 02:00:39,718
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, we would encourage, like, if you say, okay, if I need to play how much DDR to lose how much, then, you know, we've been sharing in there, like,

1504
02:00:40,091 --> 02:00:43,933
[SPEAKER_16]: Like our last thing that we put in there was different snacks.

1505
02:00:45,294 --> 02:00:49,696
[SPEAKER_16]: And about at least three people on the community now are doing low carb diets.

1506
02:00:49,737 --> 02:00:52,038
[SPEAKER_16]: We have other people who are highly active.

1507
02:00:52,818 --> 02:00:55,420
[SPEAKER_16]: And then, you know, there's my high protein thing that I'm doing.

1508
02:00:55,460 --> 02:01:02,524
[SPEAKER_16]: But mostly we just support each other's style of how we're doing it and give feedback.

1509
02:01:03,713 --> 02:01:05,554
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to follow up with you in a minute here.

1510
02:01:05,614 --> 02:01:10,837
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually just picked up a call on the Skype line here because I want to actually pick up a call while we've got somebody on the line.

1511
02:01:11,117 --> 02:01:12,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio.

1512
02:01:12,158 --> 02:01:12,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Who dis?

1513
02:01:13,498 --> 02:01:13,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello?

1514
02:01:14,059 --> 02:01:14,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

1515
02:01:15,339 --> 02:01:15,920
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Jaded.

1516
02:01:16,280 --> 02:01:16,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Jaded.

1517
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:17,320
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you?

1518
02:01:17,340 --> 02:01:18,481
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing fine.

1519
02:01:18,581 --> 02:01:18,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Yourself?

1520
02:01:19,281 --> 02:01:19,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

1521
02:01:19,681 --> 02:01:21,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this is the first time you've called into the show, isn't it?

1522
02:01:22,223 --> 02:01:22,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it is.

1523
02:01:22,863 --> 02:01:23,864
[SPEAKER_00]: Fresh blood.

1524
02:01:27,966 --> 02:01:29,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Any comment you want to make about tonight's show?

1525
02:01:29,427 --> 02:01:30,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Any comment in general?

1526
02:01:30,922 --> 02:01:33,503
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, actually, we were tired.

1527
02:01:35,403 --> 02:01:36,584
[SPEAKER_03]: I just lost you there, bud.

1528
02:01:37,704 --> 02:01:39,425
[SPEAKER_04]: You might have some bandwidth going there.

1529
02:01:39,445 --> 02:01:40,385
[SPEAKER_03]: You got bandwidth issues.

1530
02:01:40,405 --> 02:01:43,466
[SPEAKER_03]: You might want to stop anything else you're doing, even if you're listening to the show.

1531
02:01:44,506 --> 02:01:44,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me?

1532
02:01:47,727 --> 02:01:48,668
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we might have lost him.

1533
02:01:48,908 --> 02:01:49,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me, guy?

1534
02:01:49,688 --> 02:01:49,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Pardon me?

1535
02:01:50,410 --> 02:01:50,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, there you are.

1536
02:01:51,851 --> 02:01:54,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Your bandwidth, you're really choppy right now.

1537
02:01:54,852 --> 02:01:55,632
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a comment for us?

1538
02:01:56,853 --> 02:01:59,594
[SPEAKER_00]: Because my bandwidth is not being used at the time.

1539
02:02:00,194 --> 02:02:02,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, just must be a shoddy connection.

1540
02:02:02,395 --> 02:02:03,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1541
02:02:03,075 --> 02:02:05,296
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, try it now.

1542
02:02:06,977 --> 02:02:07,497
[SPEAKER_03]: A little better.

1543
02:02:07,517 --> 02:02:10,018
[SPEAKER_03]: I was noticing it, to tell you the truth.

1544
02:02:10,419 --> 02:02:12,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, what was the comment you wanted to make?

1545
02:02:12,720 --> 02:02:13,820
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll try to pick it up as best we can.

1546
02:02:14,820 --> 02:02:17,962
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the comment I wanted to make was about meeting the...

1547
02:02:18,760 --> 02:02:19,781
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, our crew, actually.

1548
02:02:19,801 --> 02:02:23,203
[SPEAKER_03]: The comment was, basically, that would pay, like, a great random prize, so to speak.

1549
02:02:23,223 --> 02:02:23,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, basically.

1550
02:02:23,644 --> 02:02:27,046
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of more or less as, like, a game show, so to speak.

1551
02:02:27,066 --> 02:02:28,908
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like the first date.

1552
02:02:44,332 --> 02:02:54,440
[SPEAKER_03]: So, okay, he's breaking up a little bit, but as I understand what he's suggesting here is that we should do some type of game show, and the big prize would be fly out here and meet the OLR crew.

1553
02:02:55,541 --> 02:02:56,662
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about that.

1554
02:02:56,742 --> 02:03:01,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, my God, that means one of us would have to put this person up and everything.

1555
02:03:01,025 --> 02:03:04,228
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be a little weird, but I like the idea.

1556
02:03:05,249 --> 02:03:08,672
[SPEAKER_03]: It just involves money, which is non-existent in our budget.

1557
02:03:09,192 --> 02:03:11,274
[SPEAKER_03]: How much was in the budget this year, DarkSakura?

1558
02:03:11,314 --> 02:03:12,835
[SPEAKER_03]: How much did we have in the Orange Launch Radio budget?

1559
02:03:13,667 --> 02:03:14,968
[SPEAKER_16]: and some sun-dried tomatoes.

1560
02:03:15,008 --> 02:03:19,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I believe we had some sun-dried tomatoes and about five jelly bellies in this year's budget.

1561
02:03:19,512 --> 02:03:20,693
[SPEAKER_16]: I contributed cashews, though.

1562
02:03:21,073 --> 02:03:22,174
[SPEAKER_03]: You did, so that was good.

1563
02:03:23,615 --> 02:03:27,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully we can sell that stuff on eBay and we'd be able to have this contest.

1564
02:03:27,558 --> 02:03:28,299
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the idea.

1565
02:03:29,160 --> 02:03:30,260
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't know if we can do it.

1566
02:03:30,861 --> 02:03:31,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you enter if we did it?

1567
02:03:32,562 --> 02:03:33,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would.

1568
02:03:33,403 --> 02:03:37,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, you're not one of those freaky stalkers that has an axe that would chop us up or anything, are you?

1569
02:03:37,606 --> 02:03:38,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.

1570
02:03:38,267 --> 02:03:38,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1571
02:03:39,108 --> 02:03:39,388
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1572
02:03:40,389 --> 02:03:40,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.

1573
02:03:40,929 --> 02:03:42,170
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, any other comment you want to make?

1574
02:03:43,450 --> 02:03:47,052
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, no, that's the only comment I really wanted to make.

1575
02:03:47,132 --> 02:03:48,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, I like the idea, Jaded.

1576
02:03:48,613 --> 02:03:50,774
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope one day we're rich and we can make it work for you guys.

1577
02:03:52,174 --> 02:03:52,455
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1578
02:03:52,515 --> 02:03:53,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, have a good one, buddy.

1579
02:03:53,635 --> 02:03:53,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

1580
02:03:54,095 --> 02:03:54,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, bye.

1581
02:03:55,276 --> 02:03:56,196
[SPEAKER_03]: We like new people calling in.

1582
02:03:56,216 --> 02:03:57,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, if you want to call in, Skype line's open.

1583
02:03:57,937 --> 02:03:58,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Give us a call there.

1584
02:03:58,878 --> 02:04:01,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie actually is over on the cam right now.

1585
02:04:01,499 --> 02:04:01,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Gasp.

1586
02:04:02,640 --> 02:04:03,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Shock and awe.

1587
02:04:04,100 --> 02:04:08,342
[SPEAKER_03]: www.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to head over there and look.

1588
02:04:10,063 --> 02:04:11,324
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, actually...

1589
02:04:12,490 --> 02:04:25,716
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what would be a good idea, is that instead of flying somebody out here necessarily to hang out in our studio house and everything like that, maybe if we were to do the Fateme thing or the E3 thing, we could actually have a Come With Us to E3 contest.

1590
02:04:26,076 --> 02:04:27,157
[SPEAKER_03]: How cool would that be?

1591
02:04:27,957 --> 02:04:31,018
[SPEAKER_03]: People would be murdering each other to do that, so I don't know.

1592
02:04:32,439 --> 02:04:32,979
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1593
02:04:33,159 --> 02:04:34,860
[SPEAKER_03]: One day we'll make one of these ideas work.

1594
02:04:34,920 --> 02:04:38,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, we've got another call on the Orange Launch Radio Skype line, so let's have a chat.

1595
02:04:38,342 --> 02:04:39,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1596
02:04:39,893 --> 02:04:40,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's hot.

1597
02:04:40,373 --> 02:04:40,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep talking.

1598
02:04:40,773 --> 02:04:41,713
[SPEAKER_03]: There are going to be...

1599
02:05:08,411 --> 02:05:18,176
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1600
02:05:31,519 --> 02:05:32,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's another thing.

1601
02:05:32,640 --> 02:05:35,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Seven new CS songs which are going to be exclusives.

1602
02:05:36,364 --> 02:05:39,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Including songs from L.E.D., Garoovy, and Megumi Over Slope.

1603
02:05:40,088 --> 02:05:43,131
[SPEAKER_03]: So surprise, we're seeing a lot of the same people that were in 8th style coming back.

1604
02:05:43,171 --> 02:05:43,811
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's a good thing.

1605
02:05:44,332 --> 02:05:45,033
[SPEAKER_03]: New L.E.D.

1606
02:05:45,413 --> 02:05:46,174
[SPEAKER_03]: is always a good thing.

1607
02:05:46,474 --> 02:05:50,258
[SPEAKER_03]: If Meg wants to do another video where she shows off her rack, fine by me.

1608
02:05:51,368 --> 02:05:52,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I heard that.

1609
02:05:52,169 --> 02:05:52,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah!

1610
02:05:53,270 --> 02:05:54,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Take it off!

1611
02:05:55,591 --> 02:06:01,174
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the last one here is a remix version of the popular song Usual Days from Poppin' Music.

1612
02:06:01,234 --> 02:06:02,996
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be on Nonstyle CS.

1613
02:06:03,236 --> 02:06:05,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, okay, so we're getting a Poppin' Music remix.

1614
02:06:05,737 --> 02:06:10,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, wasn't there another song in 8th style that was crossed over from Poppin' Music as well?

1615
02:06:11,421 --> 02:06:13,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's Everyday Lonely Day by Rosanna.

1616
02:06:13,742 --> 02:06:14,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yeah.

1617
02:06:14,603 --> 02:06:16,424
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love that song, so hopefully that's a good sign.

1618
02:06:18,664 --> 02:06:19,205
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, cool.

1619
02:06:19,265 --> 02:06:20,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other details on 9th style we know so far?

1620
02:06:21,586 --> 02:06:25,309
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the last thing there was on the message.

1621
02:06:25,570 --> 02:06:26,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, very cool.

1622
02:06:26,871 --> 02:06:29,233
[SPEAKER_03]: So I need to get back into 2DX.

1623
02:06:29,273 --> 02:06:30,093
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so far behind.

1624
02:06:30,133 --> 02:06:31,655
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to pick up 7th, 8th, and 9th style.

1625
02:06:31,675 --> 02:06:36,118
[SPEAKER_03]: But 9th style, seriously, is like my favorite song list since like 6th.

1626
02:06:36,318 --> 02:06:37,639
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have to have to get it.

1627
02:06:38,160 --> 02:06:39,881
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of these days.

1628
02:06:41,903 --> 02:06:43,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other news going on out there?

1629
02:06:44,076 --> 02:06:46,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this is the only one I've brought so far.

1630
02:06:46,557 --> 02:06:47,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, fair enough.

1631
02:06:47,477 --> 02:06:48,638
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll let you know.

1632
02:06:48,938 --> 02:06:49,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Any quick comments you want to make?

1633
02:06:50,579 --> 02:06:52,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah.

1634
02:06:52,960 --> 02:06:56,021
[SPEAKER_06]: The site that I gave you, I mean, the Dust Bacon site I gave you.

1635
02:06:56,161 --> 02:06:58,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Dust Bacon, which... Yeah.

1636
02:06:59,122 --> 02:07:00,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Just check it out after the show.

1637
02:07:02,164 --> 02:07:03,904
[SPEAKER_06]: I will have... It has a lot of videos in it.

1638
02:07:04,405 --> 02:07:07,566
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to zoom out to the goth club so I can look miserable tonight?

1639
02:07:07,986 --> 02:07:10,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, probably after the goth club or something.

1640
02:07:11,047 --> 02:07:11,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Anytime.

1641
02:07:11,668 --> 02:07:12,488
[SPEAKER_03]: I will make that happen.

1642
02:07:14,809 --> 02:07:15,089
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1643
02:07:15,750 --> 02:07:16,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for calling, my friend.

1644
02:07:16,610 --> 02:07:17,170
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.

1645
02:07:17,771 --> 02:07:18,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one, bud.

1646
02:07:18,651 --> 02:07:19,031
[SPEAKER_13]: No problem.

1647
02:07:19,151 --> 02:07:19,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye-bye.

1648
02:07:20,612 --> 02:07:21,192
[SPEAKER_03]: And look at that.

1649
02:07:21,233 --> 02:07:22,773
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting back-to-back phone calls tonight.

1650
02:07:23,294 --> 02:07:24,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1651
02:07:25,455 --> 02:07:26,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Sky.

1652
02:07:26,115 --> 02:07:26,795
[SPEAKER_08]: It's El Mullet.

1653
02:07:26,875 --> 02:07:27,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, El Mullet.

1654
02:07:27,816 --> 02:07:28,616
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you, my friend?

1655
02:07:29,177 --> 02:07:30,257
[SPEAKER_08]: I am doing good, Sky.

1656
02:07:30,297 --> 02:07:31,017
[SPEAKER_08]: How about yourself?

1657
02:07:31,178 --> 02:07:31,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm good.

1658
02:07:31,698 --> 02:07:34,399
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very happy that lots of people are interacting with the show tonight.

1659
02:07:34,459 --> 02:07:35,480
[SPEAKER_03]: This is making me very happy.

1660
02:07:35,720 --> 02:07:38,641
[SPEAKER_03]: And you were sitting on hold there for quite a while, so I appreciate your patience.

1661
02:07:39,122 --> 02:07:39,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no problem.

1662
02:07:39,742 --> 02:07:41,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody beat you to the punch a little earlier.

1663
02:07:41,183 --> 02:07:41,763
[SPEAKER_03]: What's new, buddy?

1664
02:07:43,611 --> 02:07:44,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Not much new.

1665
02:07:45,272 --> 02:07:48,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Took it to the ITG guy, like I said I was going to do last week.

1666
02:07:48,793 --> 02:07:49,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, yes, I remember this.

1667
02:07:49,733 --> 02:07:53,614
[SPEAKER_03]: You were having it out with the ITG guy in your column over on Inside Pulse.

1668
02:07:54,154 --> 02:07:54,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I was.

1669
02:07:55,114 --> 02:07:57,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Any feedback from that so far?

1670
02:07:58,555 --> 02:08:10,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, not direct feedback, except actually one person directly replied to the column on the site saying that he tried In The Groove and wasn't too impressed.

1671
02:08:10,878 --> 02:08:12,419
[SPEAKER_08]: He said it didn't have the

1672
02:08:13,157 --> 02:08:14,999
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1673
02:08:39,833 --> 02:08:45,558
[SPEAKER_08]: All that has happened now is one appears in my area so I can try it for myself so I can develop an opinion on it.

1674
02:08:45,838 --> 02:08:49,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you win the Come to Orange Lounge radio contest.

1675
02:08:50,342 --> 02:08:55,026
[SPEAKER_03]: At this rate, we're going to save our jelly bellies and that contest will be happening in 2008.

1676
02:08:57,067 --> 02:08:57,608
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see.

1677
02:08:58,629 --> 02:09:04,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully, if I can ever get a boatload of money, the first thing I'm going to do with it is to fly out and see you guys.

1678
02:09:04,454 --> 02:09:06,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now you've got a wedding coming up, right?

1679
02:09:06,693 --> 02:09:07,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I got a wedding coming up.

1680
02:09:07,634 --> 02:09:09,757
[SPEAKER_03]: You gotta spend it on the missus first, but then us.

1681
02:09:09,777 --> 02:09:10,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I do.

1682
02:09:10,317 --> 02:09:10,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I do.

1683
02:09:11,178 --> 02:09:11,559
[SPEAKER_03]: But then us.

1684
02:09:11,579 --> 02:09:13,861
[SPEAKER_08]: We're talking, like, lots of money.

1685
02:09:14,062 --> 02:09:17,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, hey, this makes me think of a topic we were just talking about earlier.

1686
02:09:17,846 --> 02:09:20,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Does your girlfriend, or your fiancé, does she end a DDR?

1687
02:09:22,209 --> 02:09:23,390
[SPEAKER_08]: She knows I play it.

1688
02:09:24,650 --> 02:09:30,133
[SPEAKER_08]: She's not too into it because she can't play very well.

1689
02:09:30,353 --> 02:09:32,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Something's wrong with her leg.

1690
02:09:32,814 --> 02:09:39,697
[SPEAKER_08]: She can walk normally, but she's had some surgeries in the past and she can't necessarily play.

1691
02:09:39,817 --> 02:09:41,898
[SPEAKER_03]: I know folks like that and they just have a hard time playing.

1692
02:09:42,799 --> 02:09:59,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, RicePrincess, I don't think she has a problem with me saying this, RicePrincess actually doesn't play a whole lot of DDR because she had surgery on her leg some time ago, and it causes her not to be able to, I mean, she can play it, but she can't play it as intensively as most of the addicts do, if you know what I mean.

1693
02:10:00,607 --> 02:10:07,312
[SPEAKER_08]: I tried getting her into it when we first started going out and nothing doing, so I said, okay, you got your opinion, that's fine.

1694
02:10:07,652 --> 02:10:08,913
[SPEAKER_08]: I did get her into Pokemon, though.

1695
02:10:09,493 --> 02:10:10,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there you go.

1696
02:10:11,315 --> 02:10:14,437
[SPEAKER_03]: See, but even though she's not into DDR, it worked, right?

1697
02:10:15,077 --> 02:10:15,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.

1698
02:10:15,578 --> 02:10:15,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.

1699
02:10:16,098 --> 02:10:22,983
[SPEAKER_03]: And is there anything that your girlfriend did that maybe at first you were like, okay, I gotta learn how to like that, or...

1700
02:10:25,963 --> 02:10:28,605
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, nothing I can think of on the top of my head.

1701
02:10:28,685 --> 02:10:29,565
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably for the best.

1702
02:10:29,625 --> 02:10:30,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Keeps you out of trouble that way.

1703
02:10:32,307 --> 02:10:33,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1704
02:10:33,708 --> 02:10:36,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other stuff going on at Inside Pulse this week we should be aware of?

1705
02:10:40,691 --> 02:10:42,572
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we have something new coming up.

1706
02:10:45,714 --> 02:10:49,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometime in the future we're going to have a Shining Force feature pop up.

1707
02:10:50,357 --> 02:10:51,177
[SPEAKER_03]: And what is that all about?

1708
02:10:52,695 --> 02:10:55,217
[SPEAKER_08]: There's an RPG series, The Shining Force.

1709
02:11:16,952 --> 02:11:19,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing like shamelessly shilling my own site.

1710
02:11:19,274 --> 02:11:20,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, nothing like it.

1711
02:11:20,655 --> 02:11:24,058
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why people call into this show, really, is to whore out their own projects, honestly.

1712
02:11:24,098 --> 02:11:24,559
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's all right.

1713
02:11:24,619 --> 02:11:24,959
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't mind.

1714
02:11:25,640 --> 02:11:26,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Come to my website.

1715
02:11:28,482 --> 02:11:29,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else you want to share?

1716
02:11:29,403 --> 02:11:31,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Any comments on what we talked about in the show?

1717
02:11:31,364 --> 02:11:36,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I've got to get going real quick.

1718
02:11:36,749 --> 02:11:37,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1719
02:11:37,290 --> 02:11:38,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's fair by me.

1720
02:11:38,390 --> 02:11:38,611
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1721
02:11:38,631 --> 02:11:39,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one, bud.

1722
02:11:39,531 --> 02:11:40,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for calling.

1723
02:11:40,192 --> 02:11:40,432
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1724
02:11:40,873 --> 02:11:41,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Later.

1725
02:11:43,295 --> 02:11:43,655
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1726
02:11:46,224 --> 02:11:50,747
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been playing over there on the webcam like crazy, haven't you, DarkSakura?

1727
02:11:52,028 --> 02:11:55,871
[SPEAKER_03]: All of a sudden I saw in the chatroom somebody had posted, Jamie's hot!

1728
02:11:58,553 --> 02:11:59,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that, I see it right there.

1729
02:11:59,694 --> 02:12:01,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie is so hot, says Dark Knight.

1730
02:12:04,518 --> 02:12:07,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie's selling it on the webcam tonight, awesome.

1731
02:12:09,362 --> 02:12:14,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine, put my magnets on the cam, but don't F up the TV with the magnetic fields and all that stuff, that would make me cry.

1732
02:12:17,196 --> 02:12:26,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's see, we have the Skype line still open, if you guys want to call in, we'll keep it open a few more minutes for you guys, just in case you want to call in there.

1733
02:12:29,269 --> 02:12:32,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to think of what else is going on in the scene right now, there's really, oh, Angel, you have a comment?

1734
02:12:34,874 --> 02:12:35,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting up there?

1735
02:12:36,284 --> 02:12:41,205
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I don't know, well actually it's something that all of us can make fun of because, oops.

1736
02:12:42,565 --> 02:12:47,346
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, um, AIM, or AOL Instant Messenger came up with it.

1737
02:12:47,406 --> 02:12:49,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, wait, hold this thought because I'm going to go off on this for a little bit.

1738
02:12:49,687 --> 02:12:50,367
[SPEAKER_03]: I know where you're going.

1739
02:12:50,407 --> 02:12:51,767
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to talk about this in detail a little bit.

1740
02:12:52,167 --> 02:12:52,967
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, never mind.

1741
02:12:53,248 --> 02:12:54,248
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, you didn't hear anything.

1742
02:12:54,308 --> 02:12:55,988
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, raise it from your minds.

1743
02:12:56,688 --> 02:12:59,249
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what we get for not preparing this show in advance, so that's fine.

1744
02:12:59,969 --> 02:13:02,029
[SPEAKER_03]: You've dealt with that for years, you'll continue to love us.

1745
02:13:02,609 --> 02:13:03,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we're going to go to the Skype line.

1746
02:13:03,950 --> 02:13:05,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Lines Radio.

1747
02:13:05,916 --> 02:13:09,440
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Dark Knight with a shameless plug to get OLR on the East Coast.

1748
02:13:22,276 --> 02:13:22,797
[SPEAKER_03]: and what the hell.

1749
02:13:22,997 --> 02:13:23,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, go for it.

1750
02:13:23,918 --> 02:13:28,061
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that project ended up taking off or what, but I guess not, because I haven't heard anything else about it.

1751
02:13:28,662 --> 02:13:29,983
[SPEAKER_03]: OLR East Coast.

1752
02:13:30,043 --> 02:13:31,564
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'd love it.

1753
02:13:31,644 --> 02:13:36,969
[SPEAKER_03]: If it was in the budget of jelly beans and cashews, I would do it, but you know... And the sun-dried tomatoes.

1754
02:13:37,029 --> 02:13:38,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, and the sun-dried tomatoes.

1755
02:13:38,750 --> 02:13:39,451
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't forget about that.

1756
02:13:39,511 --> 02:13:40,412
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good third of the budget.

1757
02:13:40,632 --> 02:13:43,935
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that we had a vote to up our budget to add spinach, too.

1758
02:13:44,155 --> 02:13:44,535
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1759
02:13:45,116 --> 02:13:45,496
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1760
02:13:45,836 --> 02:13:47,678
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have to fire somebody to add the spinach.

1761
02:13:48,218 --> 02:13:49,158
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, Angel.

1762
02:13:52,159 --> 02:13:53,939
[SPEAKER_03]: We need spinach more than an archive.

1763
02:13:54,039 --> 02:14:00,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Dark Knight, if we were to come out to the East Coast as Orange Lounge Radio, what would we do?

1764
02:14:00,400 --> 02:14:04,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Where would we be doing our show from, and what kinds of stuff would we report on, do you think?

1765
02:14:06,061 --> 02:14:10,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, I would probably have y'all in New York, in the middle of nowhere.

1766
02:14:10,202 --> 02:14:11,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Very fine, very fine.

1767
02:14:13,603 --> 02:14:14,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Covering in the groove.

1768
02:14:16,327 --> 02:14:17,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, that's it.

1769
02:14:18,207 --> 02:14:19,748
[SPEAKER_04]: This project's cancelled.

1770
02:14:20,528 --> 02:14:21,168
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm kidding.

1771
02:14:21,328 --> 02:14:22,128
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kidding.

1772
02:14:22,748 --> 02:14:30,690
[SPEAKER_03]: I would do a show live from 8 on the break with my ass planted on the up arrow of the in the groove machine if we had the money for it.

1773
02:14:31,090 --> 02:14:31,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay?

1774
02:14:31,910 --> 02:14:35,190
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jamie could have her ass planted on the down arrow on the two player side.

1775
02:14:35,210 --> 02:14:35,670
[SPEAKER_03]: And Loki?

1776
02:14:36,691 --> 02:14:37,251
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about him.

1777
02:14:38,191 --> 02:14:41,051
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe flipping it off or taking a piss on the back of it or something.

1778
02:14:41,732 --> 02:14:44,192
[SPEAKER_16]: Since I hardly ever get to do this, hi Dark Knight.

1779
02:14:44,881 --> 02:14:47,822
[SPEAKER_24]: Because you know me and my public urination.

1780
02:14:47,842 --> 02:14:53,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I think I just started to piss Dane again.

1781
02:14:54,004 --> 02:14:55,124
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, don't go there, buddy.

1782
02:14:55,184 --> 02:14:55,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't go there.

1783
02:14:56,044 --> 02:14:58,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki could be on the Parapara machine.

1784
02:14:58,305 --> 02:14:59,585
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a little ways down.

1785
02:14:59,625 --> 02:15:02,266
[SPEAKER_03]: And he could be doing his white freestyle on that.

1786
02:15:04,255 --> 02:15:05,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, if you say so.

1787
02:15:05,116 --> 02:15:08,840
[SPEAKER_05]: But like I said, give OLR money so you can bring them to the East Coast.

1788
02:15:09,040 --> 02:15:09,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.

1789
02:15:09,560 --> 02:15:10,161
[SPEAKER_05]: That is all.

1790
02:15:10,341 --> 02:15:12,203
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that give OLR money idea.

1791
02:15:12,463 --> 02:15:16,788
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, people have been telling us we should open up a PayPal thing for the longest time, a give OLR money thing.

1792
02:15:17,328 --> 02:15:21,252
[SPEAKER_24]: We do have the unofficial give OLR money thing.

1793
02:15:21,492 --> 02:15:24,976
[SPEAKER_24]: You can PayPal to nightmare underscore hunter at yahoo.com.

1794
02:15:26,637 --> 02:15:28,338
[SPEAKER_24]: Any amount of money is fine.

1795
02:15:28,778 --> 02:15:32,580
[SPEAKER_24]: All that money will not be going to Tsunami Relief.

1796
02:15:32,740 --> 02:15:36,761
[SPEAKER_24]: But you can give it to me, and I might.

1797
02:15:38,082 --> 02:15:39,962
[SPEAKER_24]: If the price is right, I might.

1798
02:15:40,803 --> 02:15:41,303
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I won't.

1799
02:15:42,902 --> 02:15:44,903
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, that is not the give OLR money.

1800
02:15:45,003 --> 02:15:48,044
[SPEAKER_03]: That is make Loki's porn collection bigger fund, okay?

1801
02:15:48,084 --> 02:15:50,505
[SPEAKER_03]: That is all you're going to do is make it... Buy porn?

1802
02:15:50,545 --> 02:15:51,286
[SPEAKER_16]: Who buys porn?

1803
02:15:51,306 --> 02:15:57,068
[SPEAKER_16]: Send to jamie at orangedownradio.com your links to your PayPal accounts and passwords.

1804
02:15:59,329 --> 02:16:13,881
[SPEAKER_16]: and the money will be well used to fund my let's go visit everybody and not go to work yeah right the pay our rent we'll have the Orange Lounge RV how about that

1805
02:16:14,511 --> 02:16:16,533
[SPEAKER_16]: Dude, we'd be like the freaking Partridge family.

1806
02:16:16,573 --> 02:16:17,874
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be rad.

1807
02:16:17,934 --> 02:16:19,135
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe we'd get our own cult.

1808
02:16:19,295 --> 02:16:29,384
[SPEAKER_03]: If we could wing it, if we had the money and we could all get like a week off of work, I would pile us all in a van and we'd drive around the country for a week.

1809
02:16:29,664 --> 02:16:33,788
[SPEAKER_16]: My work only gives leave of absence in increments of 30 days, so hey, that works for me.

1810
02:16:34,008 --> 02:16:35,669
[SPEAKER_16]: Do I get to come or am I still fired?

1811
02:16:37,771 --> 02:16:39,873
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends if the spinach can come or not.

1812
02:16:40,714 --> 02:16:40,914
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1813
02:16:41,789 --> 02:16:44,171
[SPEAKER_16]: Spinach would probably be consumed, so I guess you can come.

1814
02:16:44,471 --> 02:16:46,714
[SPEAKER_16]: I like spinach, so, yeah.

1815
02:16:48,475 --> 02:16:49,596
[SPEAKER_03]: What can I say, Dark Knight?

1816
02:16:49,676 --> 02:16:50,477
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the idea.

1817
02:16:50,577 --> 02:16:58,765
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to do the East Coast and talk about DDR out there, the whole scene out there, but until we have the money, we rely on you guys to report on the East Coast scene for us.

1818
02:16:58,785 --> 02:16:59,485
[SPEAKER_03]: You can give us money.

1819
02:16:59,825 --> 02:17:00,466
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all good.

1820
02:17:00,826 --> 02:17:02,668
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is going on on the East Coast scene right now?

1821
02:17:02,748 --> 02:17:04,630
[SPEAKER_03]: What's so freaking great about In The Groove, anyway?

1822
02:17:05,871 --> 02:17:09,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, actually, I'm in Richmond, so we'll never see you in the groove, knock on wood.

1823
02:17:10,494 --> 02:17:10,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-huh.

1824
02:17:11,475 --> 02:17:13,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what else is going on on the East Coast, then?

1825
02:17:14,117 --> 02:17:15,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing much right now.

1826
02:17:15,318 --> 02:17:18,440
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still kind of griping over the fact that we no longer have 2DX.

1827
02:17:19,220 --> 02:17:20,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, what happened?

1828
02:17:21,302 --> 02:17:26,565
[SPEAKER_05]: The machine wasn't taken care of, so they basically, the people up there called it a dead weight and got rid of it.

1829
02:17:27,586 --> 02:17:28,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that sucks.

1830
02:17:29,508 --> 02:17:33,630
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the last thing they did was put an upgrade in this machine to a V3, and that was it.

1831
02:17:33,871 --> 02:17:34,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Woo-hoo!

1832
02:17:34,864 --> 02:18:03,672
[SPEAKER_03]: you know we had a very similar sob story in Sacramento R8 style dead, gone, finally mailed away it's sad but you know the machine it's in a better place now it's in a better place now alright we're gonna let you go buddy we're gonna go to break have a good one though thanks for calling in later we heard from a lot of people tonight that was good thank you guys for calling in and making the show interesting because lord knows we're not good at it just kidding

1833
02:18:04,820 --> 02:18:10,045
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go to another break, and in this break, let's do some US DDR music, why not?

1834
02:18:10,785 --> 02:18:15,909
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know if I don't start it off with this song, that Jamie will kill me.

1835
02:18:17,251 --> 02:18:18,391
[SPEAKER_16]: We can't have that, can we?

1836
02:18:18,411 --> 02:18:23,836
[SPEAKER_03]: We cannot, so we'll be back after this with more Orange Launch Radio and the FUs of the week, coming up.

1837
02:18:39,401 --> 02:18:42,462
It's got to be forever, the green grass blows and the wind is dancing

1838
02:19:01,738 --> 02:19:10,830
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be a much better fight with you, with me If you hadn't met me, I'd be fine on my own, baby Never felt so lonely when you came along

1839
02:19:20,802 --> 02:19:22,183
[SPEAKER_13]: So now what should I do?

1840
02:19:22,223 --> 02:19:34,647
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm strung out, addicted to you My body aches, now that you're gone My supplies fell through You had to give me everything you had and more You craved my happiness When you made me feel joy and made you smile

1841
02:19:48,203 --> 02:19:48,864

[SPEAKER_03]: Gaming Radio.

1846
02:25:03,744 --> 02:25:08,707
[SPEAKER_20]: So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

1847
02:25:11,189 --> 02:25:12,530
[SPEAKER_20]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1848
02:25:15,752 --> 02:25:25,998
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, honestly, guys, that is what I absolutely love about this show is that, you know, we're supposedly about video games and DR and all that nerdy stuff, but man, when Tom Brokaw says cunt, that's funny.

1849
02:25:27,299 --> 02:25:28,540
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have to talk about it.

1850
02:25:32,285 --> 02:25:33,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Skyblind's open again.

1851
02:25:33,447 --> 02:25:36,712
[SPEAKER_03]: A few of you folks in the chatroom requested that we open it back up, so fine.

1852
02:25:37,093 --> 02:25:38,375
[SPEAKER_03]: We're opening it up for a little window.

1853
02:25:38,475 --> 02:25:41,380
[SPEAKER_03]: It's open right now, so you guys can call in right now.

1854
02:25:41,560 --> 02:25:42,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Only for a couple minutes, though.

1855
02:25:43,924 --> 02:25:45,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we're going to go on to bigger and better things.

1856
02:25:45,899 --> 02:25:50,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, that you have to be in our chat room to send in your FUs of the week.

1857
02:25:50,942 --> 02:25:52,002
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get into that segment.

1858
02:25:52,043 --> 02:25:57,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Please, though, we do have a lot of folks listening tonight, and explicit's here, which means it's going to go long anyway.

1859
02:25:57,886 --> 02:26:02,388
[SPEAKER_03]: So please, if you would, try to keep your FUs of the week short, and we'll get to those in a minute.

1860
02:26:02,428 --> 02:26:03,589
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we've got a call on the Skype line.

1861
02:26:03,629 --> 02:26:04,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to it.

1862
02:26:04,229 --> 02:26:05,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1863
02:26:08,011 --> 02:26:10,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1864
02:26:12,354 --> 02:26:12,454
Hello.

1865
02:26:13,686 --> 02:26:15,327
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear stuff moving around, but I don't hear you guys.

1866
02:26:15,587 --> 02:26:15,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello?

1867
02:26:16,467 --> 02:26:17,587
[SPEAKER_16]: It's Static Man.

1868
02:26:17,627 --> 02:26:18,188
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Static.

1869
02:26:18,808 --> 02:26:19,608
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Static Man.

1870
02:26:19,848 --> 02:26:21,649
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can hear us, we cannot hear you.

1871
02:26:21,749 --> 02:26:24,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure your microphone is turned on.

1872
02:26:25,470 --> 02:26:26,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, we got the hang up.

1873
02:26:26,410 --> 02:26:26,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Dough.

1874
02:26:27,791 --> 02:26:28,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Bummer.

1875
02:26:28,631 --> 02:26:29,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Live radio, guys.

1876
02:26:29,332 --> 02:26:29,732
[SPEAKER_03]: What can you do?

1877
02:26:29,972 --> 02:26:30,432
[SPEAKER_03]: No phone screen.

1878
02:26:30,772 --> 02:26:32,713
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not in the budget for a phone screener, either.

1879
02:26:32,773 --> 02:26:35,194
[SPEAKER_03]: We had to cut that out to make way for the jelly beans.

1880
02:26:35,734 --> 02:26:37,534
[SPEAKER_03]: So, what can we do?

1881
02:26:37,554 --> 02:26:38,755
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1882
02:26:38,795 --> 02:26:39,135
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1883
02:26:40,595 --> 02:26:42,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we'll try it again a little later.

1884
02:26:42,256 --> 02:26:44,056
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll try opening up the Skype line again a little later.

1885
02:26:44,116 --> 02:26:46,077
[SPEAKER_03]: But for now, I want to move into another topic.

1886
02:26:46,697 --> 02:26:49,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Angel, you were mentioning this and then I cut you off.

1887
02:26:49,178 --> 02:26:50,118
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so sorry, but please.

1888
02:26:50,778 --> 02:26:51,418
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on, Angel?

1889
02:26:53,299 --> 02:26:56,280
[SPEAKER_16]: I found something that we could actually make fun of if we wanted to.

1890
02:26:56,900 --> 02:27:02,562
[SPEAKER_16]: I was talking to Sky on AIM earlier, just chatting it up, and then I saw a little link that...

1891
02:27:03,956 --> 02:27:26,575
[SPEAKER_16]: It was something about an AOL Instant Messenger game, but it had something to do with dancing and I was kind of intrigued to click on it, but then I didn't want to because it was going to charge me money after a certain amount of songs and whatever, but I was almost tempted just to see how crappy it was going to be or good or however, but if it has to do with aim, usually it's crappy, right?

1892
02:27:28,257 --> 02:27:29,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we will see.

1893
02:27:29,118 --> 02:27:42,107
[SPEAKER_03]: So I investigated a little bit here, and sure enough, there is this new game that's showing up on AOL, on the Instant Messenger, in the games portion, called Groovomatic is the name of this game.

1894
02:27:42,167 --> 02:27:46,150
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Groovomatic, and I'm actually downloading it and installing it right now.

1895
02:27:46,190 --> 02:27:49,433
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're hearing a couple skips and things like that, I apologize.

1896
02:27:49,493 --> 02:27:51,334
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just moving in here.

1897
02:27:52,075 --> 02:27:54,877
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's go ahead and see if we can't...

1898
02:27:57,111 --> 02:27:59,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Get in this Groovomatic game.

1899
02:27:59,394 --> 02:28:01,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Angel, you actually didn't check this out yet?

1900
02:28:02,597 --> 02:28:08,583
[SPEAKER_16]: All I know is that you get one character and ten songs for free, and then you have to pay after that, I believe.

1901
02:28:09,004 --> 02:28:10,486
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all I know about it.

1902
02:28:11,507 --> 02:28:14,530
[SPEAKER_16]: But we'll see in about a few minutes if it's any good or not.

1903
02:28:15,894 --> 02:28:20,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this is a game made by Wild Tangent, which I know AdAware recognizes.

1904
02:28:20,496 --> 02:28:21,696
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an ad bot.

1905
02:28:21,976 --> 02:28:30,019
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have just installed an ad bot on my computer for you people, so you better appreciate this sneak preview of Groove-O-Matic.

1906
02:28:30,040 --> 02:28:34,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I'm going to go into single player mode here, and we're going to go into Groove-O-Matic.

1907
02:28:34,161 --> 02:28:36,722
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to hear what kind of songs this Groove-O-Matic game has.

1908
02:28:37,762 --> 02:28:38,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see here.

1909
02:28:39,703 --> 02:28:41,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes, it's saying Wild Tangent.

1910
02:28:42,335 --> 02:28:44,317
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the company that made this game.

1911
02:28:44,597 --> 02:28:45,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Groovy little songs there.

1912
02:28:45,618 --> 02:28:46,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we're going full screen.

1913
02:28:49,942 --> 02:28:50,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1914
02:28:50,402 --> 02:28:52,644
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do this dance to the beat option.

1915
02:28:54,305 --> 02:28:54,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, look at that.

1916
02:28:54,806 --> 02:28:55,907
[SPEAKER_03]: You get little characters.

1917
02:28:58,649 --> 02:29:02,212
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a mama on the right side there with big chichis.

1918
02:29:02,452 --> 02:29:03,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Her character's got some chichis there.

1919
02:29:04,994 --> 02:29:05,975
[SPEAKER_03]: It's her name's Janet.

1920
02:29:07,336 --> 02:29:07,877
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I can...

1921
02:29:08,809 --> 02:29:11,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, there's only one song I can play in this mini version.

1922
02:29:11,711 --> 02:29:12,971
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called La Fiesta.

1923
02:29:12,991 --> 02:29:14,472
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys ready to see La Fiesta?

1924
02:29:16,493 --> 02:29:16,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1925
02:29:17,154 --> 02:29:18,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they should be able to hear this.

1926
02:29:19,475 --> 02:29:20,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I'm going to play the song.

1927
02:29:20,535 --> 02:29:21,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see what happens.

1928
02:29:25,718 --> 02:29:26,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, is this like Bust-a-Move?

1929
02:29:27,639 --> 02:29:28,780
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of set up like it.

1930
02:29:29,080 --> 02:29:29,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see what happens.

1931
02:29:31,241 --> 02:29:32,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, run commentary while I play.

1932
02:29:34,043 --> 02:29:36,544
[SPEAKER_24]: This is, um, interesting for me.

1933
02:29:41,665 --> 02:29:42,426
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Bustamove!

1934
02:29:52,717 --> 02:29:54,779
[SPEAKER_03]: This game is just like Bustamove.

1935
02:29:54,859 --> 02:29:55,960
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't DDR at all.

1936
02:29:56,981 --> 02:29:57,441
[SPEAKER_03]: It's what?

1937
02:30:02,647 --> 02:30:04,729
[SPEAKER_03]: This song is really hot, by the way.

1938
02:30:06,641 --> 02:30:07,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, wait, I'm going to back out.

1939
02:30:07,722 --> 02:30:08,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I hit escape.

1940
02:30:08,763 --> 02:30:14,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's actually, it looks like there's a mode in there that is something about freestyle.

1941
02:30:14,807 --> 02:30:17,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you can play with your own MP3s.

1942
02:30:17,669 --> 02:30:18,509
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to do that mode.

1943
02:30:18,529 --> 02:30:19,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see if I can do it.

1944
02:30:21,512 --> 02:30:22,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Little goody, I can.

1945
02:30:25,714 --> 02:30:26,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see if I can find it.

1946
02:30:28,036 --> 02:30:30,178
[SPEAKER_03]: What would be a good song to dance to in freestyle mode?

1947
02:30:30,458 --> 02:30:31,679
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we're not going to do girls.

1948
02:30:35,621 --> 02:30:36,262
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to do something...

1949
02:30:37,751 --> 02:30:38,431
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm using here.

1950
02:30:40,573 --> 02:30:41,153
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't want to work.

1951
02:30:41,233 --> 02:30:41,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shoot.

1952
02:30:41,753 --> 02:30:43,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, hopefully I have something in this folder.

1953
02:30:44,835 --> 02:30:45,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, it's glitching out on me.

1954
02:30:46,156 --> 02:30:46,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Yikes.

1955
02:30:48,197 --> 02:30:51,659
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm already getting really bad glitches here.

1956
02:30:51,699 --> 02:30:52,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, there we go.

1957
02:30:52,220 --> 02:30:52,880
[SPEAKER_03]: It fixed itself.

1958
02:30:54,761 --> 02:30:55,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1959
02:30:55,261 --> 02:30:56,402
[SPEAKER_03]: What's a song I can do here?

1960
02:31:01,005 --> 02:31:01,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, guys.

1961
02:31:02,766 --> 02:31:03,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here we go.

1962
02:31:03,346 --> 02:31:06,208
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do this song.

1963
02:31:07,574 --> 02:31:08,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see how this works.

1964
02:31:10,955 --> 02:31:14,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so it's loading the song I just picked right now, and let's see how this plays.

1965
02:31:21,259 --> 02:31:22,239
[SPEAKER_24]: Loki, commentary please.

1966
02:31:23,279 --> 02:31:24,520
[SPEAKER_24]: Same shitty game still.

1967
02:31:29,201 --> 02:31:30,042
[SPEAKER_24]: Same background.

1968
02:31:34,523 --> 02:31:35,263
[SPEAKER_04]: And wow, this rocks.

1969
02:31:38,934 --> 02:31:41,596
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's just sitting there doing nothing.

1970
02:31:42,136 --> 02:31:43,617
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just dancing back and forth.

1971
02:31:43,637 --> 02:31:43,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

1972
02:31:44,397 --> 02:31:45,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's like DDR.

1973
02:31:47,399 --> 02:31:48,239
[SPEAKER_24]: This is DDR.

1974
02:31:51,001 --> 02:31:52,482
[SPEAKER_24]: This is exactly DDR.

1975
02:31:52,802 --> 02:31:54,083
[SPEAKER_24]: Wow, we ripped off DDR.

1976
02:31:58,185 --> 02:32:00,046
[SPEAKER_24]: What the hell is that chick doing on the side?

1977
02:32:01,167 --> 02:32:02,207
[SPEAKER_24]: Why is she getting naked?

1978
02:32:02,407 --> 02:32:06,990
[SPEAKER_24]: I like this game, but why... What the hell?

1979
02:32:07,605 --> 02:32:09,526
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like the guy game, but not.

1980
02:32:10,126 --> 02:32:13,148
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not even playing the damn MP3 I told it to play.

1981
02:32:13,628 --> 02:32:14,208
[SPEAKER_03]: That's hokey.

1982
02:32:15,989 --> 02:32:17,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, what can we say?

1983
02:32:17,570 --> 02:32:19,791
[SPEAKER_03]: That was interesting, to say the least.

1984
02:32:19,831 --> 02:32:20,792
[SPEAKER_03]: That was retarded.

1985
02:32:21,432 --> 02:32:24,734
[SPEAKER_03]: But it had Buster Groove and DDR stuff in it.

1986
02:32:24,814 --> 02:32:25,614
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of weird.

1987
02:32:25,714 --> 02:32:27,035
[SPEAKER_03]: That blows.

1988
02:32:27,135 --> 02:32:28,996
[SPEAKER_03]: It stole ideas from two games there.

1989
02:32:29,036 --> 02:32:29,736
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that about?

1990
02:32:30,877 --> 02:32:32,478
[SPEAKER_07]: That blows hard.

1991
02:32:32,798 --> 02:32:36,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, I can't believe we're going to advertise this game that we just did there.

1992
02:32:37,501 --> 02:32:45,445
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to check this out for yourself, open up AOL Instant Messenger and look on your games panel because it's right there waiting for you to play.

1993
02:32:45,585 --> 02:32:47,105
[SPEAKER_03]: So, have at it, people.

1994
02:32:47,626 --> 02:32:49,546
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sorry we were not able to put that on the cam.

1995
02:32:49,867 --> 02:32:53,728
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll try to do that next week for you guys because we have to actually load it on a different computer to do that.

1996
02:32:53,768 --> 02:32:56,790
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would involve putting spyware on Loki's computer.

1997
02:32:58,330 --> 02:32:58,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1998
02:33:00,691 --> 02:33:01,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1999
02:33:01,252 --> 02:33:04,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for bringing this show down with that crappy game, Angel.

2000
02:33:04,853 --> 02:33:06,214
[SPEAKER_16]: I knew it was going to be a crappy game.

2001
02:33:06,294 --> 02:33:06,874
[SPEAKER_16]: I just thought it was

2002
02:33:10,572 --> 02:33:15,793
[SPEAKER_03]: To that game's credit, it's not as bad as some of the knockoff games I've seen out there available for download.

2003
02:33:15,813 --> 02:33:18,733
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that one that had all the classical music in MIDI format?

2004
02:33:18,773 --> 02:33:19,913
[SPEAKER_03]: It was by, like, GameHouse or something?

2005
02:33:20,213 --> 02:33:21,554
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Tapajam, wasn't it?

2006
02:33:21,834 --> 02:33:22,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Tapajam.

2007
02:33:22,634 --> 02:33:23,774
[SPEAKER_02]: That game's... oh, boy.

2008
02:33:24,914 --> 02:33:26,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that game was bad.

2009
02:33:26,035 --> 02:33:28,695
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a bad game.

2010
02:33:34,981 --> 02:33:38,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we are going to go into the FUs of the week.

2011
02:33:39,245 --> 02:33:40,005
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that time.

2012
02:33:40,586 --> 02:33:41,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you guys ready?

2013
02:33:41,907 --> 02:33:45,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, why is it that we have to do the FUs of the week every single week?

2014
02:33:45,550 --> 02:33:47,732
[SPEAKER_16]: Because we're not going to take it anymore.

2015
02:33:54,858 --> 02:33:56,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, this is bad.

2016
02:33:56,119 --> 02:33:57,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Here is justice.

2017
02:33:57,881 --> 02:33:58,882
[SPEAKER_10]: Here is punishment.

2018
02:33:58,902 --> 02:33:59,102
[SPEAKER_10]: Here.

2019
02:33:59,142 --> 02:34:00,303
[SPEAKER_13]: This is fucked up.

2020
02:34:03,863 --> 02:34:11,006
[SPEAKER_16]: A big F you goes, of course, to the usual traffic, fog, sunny skies that get in my eyes.

2021
02:34:14,067 --> 02:34:20,089
[SPEAKER_16]: Really, I think it had to do with just being sick when I was out in the Bay Area on Friday.

2022
02:34:20,629 --> 02:34:26,291
[SPEAKER_16]: And also a big F you to not being able to purchase Twinbee for the Game Boy Advance because Network had it.

2023
02:34:26,798 --> 02:34:33,323
[SPEAKER_16]: and a big F you to Nintendo for giving them better packaging in Japan because the old releases are really awesome looking.

2024
02:34:33,343 --> 02:34:36,246
[SPEAKER_16]: They come in very tiny versions of the original boxes.

2025
02:34:39,268 --> 02:34:42,451
[SPEAKER_16]: Another F you goes toward time-distance lack of money.

2026
02:34:44,473 --> 02:34:45,954
[SPEAKER_16]: School's starting next week.

2027
02:34:47,795 --> 02:34:52,960
[SPEAKER_16]: Really, this is not a whole bunch I'm overly angsty about immediately.

2028
02:34:53,980 --> 02:34:54,281
[SPEAKER_16]: Shock.

2029
02:34:56,531 --> 02:35:05,416
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, yeah, and, uh, and FU to, uh... Oh, not being able to install certain games on my system yet.

2030
02:35:05,936 --> 02:35:10,358
[SPEAKER_16]: And Gravity for being assholes, and Ragnarok Online 2 for not being out yet.

2031
02:35:11,479 --> 02:35:11,959
[SPEAKER_16]: That's it.

2032
02:35:12,820 --> 02:35:14,280
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, and the scale at the damn gym.

2033
02:35:15,801 --> 02:35:16,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, dear.

2034
02:35:16,321 --> 02:35:16,662
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2035
02:35:17,442 --> 02:35:18,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

2036
02:35:18,543 --> 02:35:19,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, your turn.

2037
02:35:21,844 --> 02:35:24,666
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm... I'm getting tired now.

2038
02:35:24,786 --> 02:35:24,906
[SPEAKER_24]: Um...

2039
02:35:26,035 --> 02:35:29,358
[SPEAKER_24]: The only F you of the week goes to me for being stupid and making a dumb mistake.

2040
02:35:30,419 --> 02:35:31,680
[SPEAKER_24]: So, yeah.

2041
02:35:32,421 --> 02:35:40,868
[SPEAKER_24]: And, um... Fuck you to, um, actually... To Tahoe Joes for ruining mashed potatoes.

2042
02:35:41,228 --> 02:35:44,171
[SPEAKER_24]: They single-handedly ruined something that's so simple...

2043
02:35:45,026 --> 02:35:47,727
[SPEAKER_24]: F you to the lack of angst in the room tonight.

2044
02:35:47,827 --> 02:35:49,048
[SPEAKER_24]: What is up with that?

2045
02:36:15,935 --> 02:36:16,255
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

2046
02:36:16,435 --> 02:36:16,755
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

2047
02:36:17,115 --> 02:36:20,618
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate to be on the same page, but I really have a lot of the same FUs.

2048
02:36:21,178 --> 02:36:23,300
[SPEAKER_03]: FU to difficult situations.

2049
02:36:23,400 --> 02:36:30,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I just... I kind of... Like, there was like a... Somebody proposed something to me.

2050
02:36:30,325 --> 02:36:31,766
[SPEAKER_03]: This is going to sound dirty, but it's not.

2051
02:36:31,806 --> 02:36:32,226
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear to God.

2052
02:36:32,586 --> 02:36:35,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody kind of proposed something interesting out there.

2053
02:36:35,649 --> 02:36:37,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, and it has to do with my professional career.

2054
02:36:37,850 --> 02:36:39,111
[SPEAKER_03]: I got an interesting proposal.

2055
02:36:39,611 --> 02:36:41,513
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm really torn.

2056
02:36:41,673 --> 02:36:42,393
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what to do.

2057
02:36:42,634 --> 02:36:44,355
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'm just going to kind of put my...

2058
02:36:45,169 --> 02:36:45,870
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying anything.

2059
02:36:45,890 --> 02:36:45,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

2060
02:37:15,197 --> 02:37:16,978
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, actually, if I can sneak something in.

2061
02:37:17,078 --> 02:37:17,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

2062
02:37:17,899 --> 02:37:20,220
[SPEAKER_16]: F you to my voice for deciding it doesn't want to work.

2063
02:37:21,841 --> 02:37:22,241
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2064
02:37:23,502 --> 02:37:26,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go on and move on with the rest of the FUs of the week.

2065
02:37:27,945 --> 02:37:30,346
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to regret this, but let's start with Explicit.

2066
02:37:30,646 --> 02:37:31,006
Okay.

2067
02:37:31,427 --> 02:37:32,287
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to ask you a question.

2068
02:37:32,307 --> 02:37:34,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Did any of my FUs get to the last week?

2069
02:37:35,289 --> 02:37:37,450
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even remember what we touched on last week.

2070
02:37:37,490 --> 02:37:38,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Last week was last week.

2071
02:37:40,455 --> 02:37:46,336
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I cut out most of your FUs that dealt with people in particular because we don't like those types of FUs.

2072
02:37:46,576 --> 02:37:49,777
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd ask that you just try to pass those ones up.

2073
02:37:50,637 --> 02:37:52,577
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember which ones you can say.

2074
02:37:52,778 --> 02:37:53,258
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

2075
02:37:53,398 --> 02:37:55,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Just what's new this week that pissed you off?

2076
02:37:56,098 --> 02:37:57,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Three hour show, buddy.

2077
02:37:58,979 --> 02:37:59,359
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2078
02:38:00,359 --> 02:38:05,120
[SPEAKER_07]: FU for having a third crack in my fucking window over debris over a freaking storm again.

2079
02:38:06,147 --> 02:38:09,848
[SPEAKER_07]: God, three cracks in a window off in one whole month.

2080
02:38:09,868 --> 02:38:12,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Ain't that a fucking bitch.

2081
02:38:13,589 --> 02:38:16,049
[SPEAKER_07]: F you for school for starting next week.

2082
02:38:17,170 --> 02:38:19,450
[SPEAKER_07]: There goes packing up some of the books again.

2083
02:38:21,151 --> 02:38:25,472
[SPEAKER_07]: F you with everybody trying to make my tournament a joke again with the piss.

2084
02:38:26,514 --> 02:38:27,254
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny.

2085
02:38:27,674 --> 02:38:28,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

2086
02:38:31,395 --> 02:38:31,996
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a joke.

2087
02:38:32,056 --> 02:38:34,116
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a tournament, just like everything else.

2088
02:38:34,216 --> 02:38:38,257
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not something to take a piss on or whatever.

2089
02:38:38,277 --> 02:38:41,218
[SPEAKER_07]: And if YouTube people...

2090
02:38:44,219 --> 02:38:48,361
[SPEAKER_07]: who wants to start drama privately and sending their private messages to me privately.

2091
02:38:49,162 --> 02:38:54,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Just because you don't like somebody in this tournament does not mean you guys are not going to get along.

2092
02:38:55,085 --> 02:38:55,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Get over it.

2093
02:38:57,247 --> 02:38:58,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait till the tournament comes in.

2094
02:38:58,607 --> 02:38:59,268
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all it is.

2095
02:39:00,208 --> 02:39:07,573
[SPEAKER_07]: If it comes to people begging for the freaking song list for the tournament, goddammit, I told you the list is going to be 16 songs.

2096
02:39:09,747 --> 02:39:10,347
[SPEAKER_07]: That is all.

2097
02:39:10,607 --> 02:39:11,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing else.

2098
02:39:11,287 --> 02:39:12,648
[SPEAKER_07]: I will not reveal it to the tournament.

2099
02:39:13,368 --> 02:39:14,268
[SPEAKER_07]: I said on the rules.

2100
02:39:15,208 --> 02:39:15,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Just deal with it.

2101
02:39:16,749 --> 02:39:21,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Next person who... Next person who mentions this in private will be banned from my tournament.

2102
02:39:22,230 --> 02:39:22,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously.

2103
02:39:22,750 --> 02:39:29,492
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting a headache with all these people trying to complain and bitch about certain things that should not be bitched about.

2104
02:39:32,888 --> 02:39:39,678
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Effie goes to a stroke that my grandmother just recently had.

2105
02:39:41,520 --> 02:39:42,642
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty depressing.

2106
02:39:43,663 --> 02:39:48,069
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't really want to say this in the Effies, but yeah, strokes suck.

2107
02:39:50,532 --> 02:39:51,053
[SPEAKER_07]: And F.E.

2108
02:39:51,093 --> 02:39:55,658
[SPEAKER_07]: goes from misplanned, from plans being all mixed up on Friday.

2109
02:39:56,279 --> 02:40:05,490
[SPEAKER_07]: I was supposed to go to, I was supposedly supposed to go to Canada's freestyle meetup, but things got mixed up so I had to go to Reno with a few people.

2110
02:40:06,010 --> 02:40:08,333
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was planned earlier before the meetup.

2111
02:40:10,715 --> 02:40:19,098
[SPEAKER_07]: and Effie goes from the same people who are complaining about the religious issue over some games or censorship issues.

2112
02:40:19,758 --> 02:40:34,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Just because something has explicit content or whatever or they think it's offensive like a puppet of Maria from Banya think it's too religiously offensive is a reason why the puppet was removed from the Paradise Island.

2113
02:40:35,310 --> 02:40:36,571
[SPEAKER_03]: You have got to be kidding me.

2114
02:40:36,971 --> 02:40:38,191
[SPEAKER_07]: I shit you not.

2115
02:40:38,651 --> 02:40:40,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is that game, why is that song offensive?

2116
02:40:40,592 --> 02:40:42,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it says Ave Maria.

2117
02:40:43,173 --> 02:40:47,735
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see how that, let me tell Mary, I don't see how that is offending a Christian group.

2118
02:40:49,776 --> 02:40:52,877
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't say Ave Maria set your child on fire.

2119
02:40:53,177 --> 02:40:53,977
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on.

2120
02:40:54,057 --> 02:40:54,857
[SPEAKER_16]: It doesn't even say that at all.

2121
02:40:54,877 --> 02:40:57,118
[SPEAKER_16]: They're probably thinking it's blasphemous or something.

2122
02:40:57,138 --> 02:40:58,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God, you've got to be kidding me.

2123
02:40:59,355 --> 02:41:00,636
[SPEAKER_16]: I thought that I left Alabama.

2124
02:41:00,676 --> 02:41:01,397
[SPEAKER_16]: What's up with this?

2125
02:41:01,717 --> 02:41:02,658
[SPEAKER_24]: Fuck Christians!

2126
02:41:02,998 --> 02:41:08,642
[SPEAKER_24]: I hate the goddamn stupid super Christians out there that want to convert all the evils in the world.

2127
02:41:09,083 --> 02:41:13,106
[SPEAKER_24]: It's you people that ruin our TV and ruin our radio and music.

2128
02:41:13,366 --> 02:41:18,450
[SPEAKER_24]: Goddamn, if I want to see boobies flash by accident on TV, that's my God-given right.

2129
02:41:18,530 --> 02:41:24,034
[SPEAKER_24]: And if your children don't see, if happen to catch those boobies, it's time to tell them about life.

2130
02:41:24,114 --> 02:41:24,875
[SPEAKER_24]: Because guess what?

2131
02:41:25,275 --> 02:41:27,957
[SPEAKER_24]: One day or another they're going to see them, and that's that.

2132
02:41:28,457 --> 02:41:38,981
[SPEAKER_16]: If your children catch sight of boobies or happen to hear shit, fuck, damn, no matter what on TV or the radio, it's your fault for not censoring them, okay?

2133
02:41:39,461 --> 02:41:42,662
[SPEAKER_03]: The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio are absolutely true.

2134
02:41:44,203 --> 02:41:47,464
[SPEAKER_16]: Do your goddamn job and stop blaming the media for...

2135
02:41:48,982 --> 02:41:51,883
[SPEAKER_16]: Screwing up babysitting your children when it's not their responsibility.

2136
02:41:52,363 --> 02:41:58,204
[SPEAKER_16]: If you're going to get knocked up and have the kid, you need to take some goddamn responsibility, okay?

2137
02:41:59,484 --> 02:42:01,565
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's a little funny, though, about the religious issue?

2138
02:42:01,865 --> 02:42:07,286
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to point out, Loki was giving an F you to what we coined super Christians.

2139
02:42:07,686 --> 02:42:09,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Not all Christians, okay?

2140
02:42:09,226 --> 02:42:12,207
[SPEAKER_03]: You can be religious and be one with God and all that stuff.

2141
02:42:12,267 --> 02:42:13,007
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

2142
02:42:13,307 --> 02:42:15,008
[SPEAKER_03]: That's your right as an American.

2143
02:42:15,328 --> 02:42:16,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Freedom of religion.

2144
02:42:16,188 --> 02:42:16,708
[SPEAKER_03]: But remember...

2145
02:42:17,523 --> 02:42:21,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Freedom of religion means I'm free to choose my religion as well.

2146
02:42:22,326 --> 02:42:22,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it?

2147
02:42:23,267 --> 02:42:23,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

2148
02:42:24,027 --> 02:42:25,629
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's funny about the situation?

2149
02:42:27,070 --> 02:42:31,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Christians say they want to stand up to themselves, yet they commit a sin.

2150
02:42:33,194 --> 02:42:37,977
[SPEAKER_07]: A sin of wrath, of anger, saying this thing is offensive.

2151
02:42:37,997 --> 02:42:41,059
[SPEAKER_07]: They go outrageous to the management and patent vending themselves.

2152
02:42:42,120 --> 02:42:46,383
[SPEAKER_07]: And now they're doing almost the same thing to DDR because Heysel Fuse says the word fuck in it.

2153
02:42:47,344 --> 02:42:50,586
[SPEAKER_07]: and they try to get rid of DDR and try to screw my tournament over.

2154
02:42:50,646 --> 02:42:55,609
[SPEAKER_03]: If they want to screw my tournament over... I'm not sure if that was... Finger on the cam, okay?

2155
02:42:55,629 --> 02:42:55,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2156
02:42:56,730 --> 02:42:57,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously.

2157
02:42:58,531 --> 02:42:59,911
[SPEAKER_16]: I actually need to throw in an FU.

2158
02:43:00,852 --> 02:43:03,734
[SPEAKER_16]: FU to the majority of humanity for being stupid.

2159
02:43:05,234 --> 02:43:06,015
[SPEAKER_16]: And for sucking.

2160
02:43:08,283 --> 02:43:35,075
[SPEAKER_07]: and now I have to censor my props for this tournament so these don't go too far so I can't use my fuck you hat or I have to put a I have to put a white label so it doesn't show fuck you on this I can't bring vibrators on the tournament as a prop I can't bring barbed wire, I can't bring glass, I can't bring a tit cup that I have and etc etc etc that results in provoking the media

2161
02:43:36,977 --> 02:43:38,277
[SPEAKER_07]: because I don't want to get sued.

2162
02:43:39,157 --> 02:43:41,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless I do a counter-loss and people stand up for me.

2163
02:43:43,478 --> 02:43:44,359
[SPEAKER_07]: And let's see.

2164
02:43:45,479 --> 02:43:52,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, since I don't know which FU's got into last week's show, I just have to say to be continued for now.

2165
02:43:54,381 --> 02:43:56,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh good, we'll finish this show in three hours after all.

2166
02:43:56,781 --> 02:43:58,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Arcadian, your turn.

2167
02:44:00,682 --> 02:44:02,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck you, this cold is hanging around still.

2168
02:44:04,143 --> 02:44:05,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck you to the puddles of

2169
02:44:05,914 --> 02:44:06,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Angel!

2170
02:44:30,097 --> 02:44:30,617
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, F.U.

2171
02:44:30,637 --> 02:44:33,758
[SPEAKER_16]: to being sick earlier this week, seems like that's going around around here.

2172
02:44:33,778 --> 02:44:39,500
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, uh, yeah, I don't think, oh yeah, F.U.

2173
02:44:39,520 --> 02:44:41,820
[SPEAKER_16]: to school is starting on Tuesday because I don't want to go, but whatever.

2174
02:44:42,961 --> 02:44:46,402
[SPEAKER_16]: It's my educational goals or something.

2175
02:44:47,603 --> 02:45:01,200
[SPEAKER_16]: and, uh, I don't want to, you know, work tomorrow, but I got to anyway, and whatever, so, that kind of sucks, and, um, I guess that's it, because I can't think of, uh, the FDs I was going to think of, so whatever!

2176
02:45:02,552 --> 02:45:02,913
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2177
02:45:03,433 --> 02:45:08,659
[SPEAKER_03]: With one notable exception, the room here is pretty not angsty tonight.

2178
02:45:08,699 --> 02:45:10,381
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a lack of angst tonight.

2179
02:45:10,401 --> 02:45:12,043
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to keep it as a three-hour show.

2180
02:45:12,063 --> 02:45:12,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up, exception.

2181
02:45:14,266 --> 02:45:14,686
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2182
02:45:16,068 --> 02:45:20,092
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's go and see if our chat room outdoes us tonight in the angst.

2183
02:45:20,152 --> 02:45:21,033
[SPEAKER_03]: We will have a look here.

2184
02:45:22,735 --> 02:45:23,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Misty!

2185
02:45:24,138 --> 02:45:25,659
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkNight says, DarkNight says, DarkTetsuya says,

2186
02:45:49,793 --> 02:45:50,374
[SPEAKER_03]: in Seattle.

2187
02:45:51,034 --> 02:45:53,897
[SPEAKER_03]: MPQ says, F you to Sonic commercials.

2188
02:45:54,018 --> 02:45:55,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the Hedgehog, but the Burger Chain, I imagine.

2189
02:45:56,240 --> 02:45:59,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time I see their commercials, I think, oh man, I want that.

2190
02:45:59,283 --> 02:45:59,744
[SPEAKER_03]: But wait!

2191
02:46:00,164 --> 02:46:01,386
[SPEAKER_03]: There aren't any around here.

2192
02:46:01,946 --> 02:46:02,306
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

2193
02:46:02,327 --> 02:46:03,388
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the same problem.

2194
02:46:03,488 --> 02:46:07,272
[SPEAKER_03]: They advertise Sonic all the time in Sacramento, and the nearest one is an hour drive away.

2195
02:46:08,584 --> 02:46:09,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Go figure.

2196
02:46:09,184 --> 02:46:10,205
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a Sonic in Yuba City.

2197
02:46:10,225 --> 02:46:10,905
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the closest one.

2198
02:46:11,725 --> 02:46:15,446
[SPEAKER_16]: When I lived in the Bay Area, that's all we got was Sonic commercials.

2199
02:46:15,746 --> 02:46:19,208
[SPEAKER_16]: And at least in the area that I was living in, we didn't even have one.
