Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity, Orange Lounge may contain plenty of...

6
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,880
Uh, moo-ch-uh, moo-caw-key.

7
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,880
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that.

8
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,880

You're tuned into the BEE money scene's most fabulatastic radio station of all things.

15
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,880
music, video, gaming. That doesn't suck.

16
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,880
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

17
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,880
Or maybe you know me as Rob Roberts. Or maybe you know me as Asshole, as some people are saying.

18
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,880
Ski! Ski!

19
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,880
Also joining me tonight are my lovely co-hosts. In that corner, the happiest bunny

20
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,880
on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers, aka Dark Sakura.

21
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,880
Okay, you can just shut up.

22
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,880
I'm kidding.

23
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:50,360
I had, I resisted temptation, which everyone is going to hear about later, but everybody

24
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,280
needs to be proud of me.

25
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,520
You're special and that makes me proud.

26
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,520
And you know what?

27
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,520
So are you.

28
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,400
When are you going to join the Olympic team?

29
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,480
When they make DVR an Olympic sport.

30
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,480
Oh my God.

31
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,480
Oh my God.

32
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,480
When DVR is going to be in the Olympics.

33
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,480
Oh my God.

34
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,480
Oh no.

35
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,480
Jumping on a trampoline is an Olympic sport.

36
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,480
Also joining us tonight, say hello to the Tech Massa, with a Massa plan, Loki.

37
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:51,160
Yeah, hi.

38
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,380
Who has one of those looks of, I don't know what to do tonight.

39
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,120
These people are very strange.

40
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,160
Also joining us, say hello to our very special guest this evening.

41
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,180
He's also special, just like Dark Sakura.

42
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,180
Say hello to Arcadian42.

43
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,060
Is this a nice pretty mic, or is it?

44
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:16,060
The new North Pretty microphone actually works, but it's kind of quiet.

45
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,060
You're kind of quiet, so you're really going to have to try tonight.

46
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:26,060
Listen in!

47
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:31,060
Well, you don't have to yell out there to listen in, because obviously they're already listening, right?

48
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:36,060
Exactly.

49
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:42,500
a little closer. Come really close. Come really close. Come close to me for a minute. Come

50
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:51,500
close to the speakers. Boo! Uh, yeah, anyway, we got tons of interesting stuff to talk about

51
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:59,420
tonight, or at least in theory we do. Um, we, yeah, just keep thinking the show is good

52
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,140
and then it will be good. It's going to be interesting because it's somewhat of a slow

53
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,500
Newsweek. We do have a couple big things we want to talk about. We're going to do that.

54
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,660
But, you know, all the favorite, usual garbage you're used to. We're going to talk about

55
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:14,700
that. When we come back from this break, in this break, we're going to do some music from

56
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:19,180
Dancing Stage Fusion, which is the Europe DDR, like, that just came out a couple months

57
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,500
ago. Actually, it was more than a couple months ago, but, you know, end of last year. But

58
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,740
they got some cool licenses in their version of DDR, and you're not going to believe some

59
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:30,460
of the stuff you're going to hear in this break. It is all in the British DDR. So enjoy

60
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:35,820
Enjoy this, and we will be back after this with more of the same old crap you know and

61
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,260
love here at Orange Lawns Radio.

62
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:42,620
Join our chat, www.orangelawnsradio.com, click on chat, and we'll be back after this, starting

63
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,220
it off with DJ Sammy, No Not Heaven, the other song.

64
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:53,220
We'll be back.

65
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,220
Like shining bright

66
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,220
The sunlight

67
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:48,220
I'm drifting away somehow by the presence of the morning sun

68
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:54,620
I'm falling into the night, as I can see you shining bright

69
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,620
Sunlight

70
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:11,700
The night

71
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:51,620
Come, come, come into my world Let me up, up, high up on your love

72
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:59,620
Take these offers made for lovin' And this heart that will bleed for two

73
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:07,620
Take these eyes open back for watchin' over you

74
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:14,620
And I've been such a long time waitin' For someone I could call my own

75
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:25,620
I've been chasing the life I've dreamed of and now I'm home

76
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:31,620
I need your love

77
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:37,620
Nice, I need more than this

78
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:45,620
Why won't you come, come, come and steal my love

79
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:53,620
And drive me up, up, higher on your love

80
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:30,620
Fire in the Taco Bell Fire on the disco

81
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:35,620
Fire in the gates of hell

82
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,620
Does it wanna know how they keep dying fire?

83
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:44,620
It's my desire, it's my desire, it's my desire

84
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,620
Don't you wanna know how to keep starting fire?

85
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:52,620
It's my desire, it's my desire, it's my desire

86
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,620
Danger, danger, high voltage.

87
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,620
When we touch, when we can.

88
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:05,620
Danger, danger, high voltage.

89
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:11,620
When we touch, when we kiss, when we touch, danger, danger.

90
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:18,620
High voltage, when we touch, when we kiss, danger, danger.

91
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,620
Time for more things

92
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,620
Oh, when we touch, what do we get?

93
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,620
When we touch, what do we get?

94
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,620
Tell me, tell me

95
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,620
Is life just a playground?

96
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,620
Can't you take that from me?

97
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:52,620
It's a real deal honey, and someone will always look out for you

98
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,620
But wake up baby, you're so totally deluded

99
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:05,620
You'll end up old and lonely, if you don't get a boo in your head

100
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:22,620
Good luck, good luck, good luck in your new bed

101
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:29,620
And join the nightmare, when you're up to no end

102
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,620
Oh. Good luck, good luck

103
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,620
Good luck in your new bag

104
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,620
Enjoy your nightmares

105
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,620
Part of life

106
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,620
When you're roughing your way

107
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,620
Good luck, good luck

108
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,620
Good luck in your new bag

109
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,960
part of life

110
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,620
Enjoy your nightmares

111
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,620
part of life

112
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,620
When you're roughing your way

113
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,780
part of life

114
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,620
good, good luck

115
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,960
In your new bag

116
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,960
Enjoy your night, babe, when your breath's too low, babe.

117
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:07,960
Good, good luck, if you do bad. Enjoy your night, babe.

118
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:25,960
Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

119
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:30,680
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

120
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,380
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and in that break you heard some songs from Dancing

121
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,380
Stage Fusion.

122
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,480
To give you an idea, if you didn't know what some of those songs were, DJ Sammy with Sunlight,

123
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,420
Kylie Minogue, Come Into My World, Electric Six with Danger High Voltage, also known as

124
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:49,500
the Taco Bell song, and Basement Jacks, Good Luck.

125
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,220
All of those are songs that are really cool.

126
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:57,220
I would play that song in my spin class, because I introduced my spin teacher to Good Luck.

127
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,220
Wasn't that a former Cage Match pick of yours, too?

128
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,220
It was. And it was also in the Queer Eye soundtrack.

129
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:13,220
And look, it ended up in DDR. And Kylie Minogue, coming to my world, was once in the Orange Launch Cage Match, ended up in DDR. Look at that.

130
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,220
So people don't think we know what we're talking about, but, you know, shit.

131
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:23,220
Just cross your fingers that Girls by Prodigy will not end up in DDR.

132
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,220
Oh, it will.

133
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,220
It will.

134
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,220
Alright.

135
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:33,220
Anyway, man, they are just so lucky over there in Europe to be getting all those, like, really good songs.

136
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:39,220
I know they get a lot of, like, crappy, poppy songs too, but, you know, I honestly...

137
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,220
And David Hasselhoff.

138
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:48,220
I honestly would take, not in DDR thankfully, I honestly would take their lineup of songs over what we got.

139
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:56,220
Not that what we got was bad, I can't complain, you know, we did get some good stuff, but I would have rather have that.

140
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:03,220
And it kind of sucks because it's really hard to import the Europe DDR because you have to get one of those converters for your TV as well.

141
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:09,220
It's easy to import Japanese, you just get a Japanese PlayStation 2, get the Japanese game, and the TVs are the same format.

142
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,220
But if you want to do the Europe, the TVs are in a different format.

143
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,220
The screens are actually a different resolution over there.

144
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,220
They're PAL.

145
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:21,220
Stupid Europe and their base 10 measurement systems.

146
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,220
Stupid metric system and everything being easy math.

147
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,220
Like the rest of the world uses.

148
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,220
Hello?

149
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,220
I know, I know.

150
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,220
All right.

151
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,220
I'm looking at the comments in our chat room.

152
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,220
www.orangeisnostraeo.com.

153
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,220
Click on chat.

154
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:42,220
Kaded2005 says, uh, girls would probably end up in DDR as Konami's way to shaft us, again.

155
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:45,220
I would cry.

156
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:51,220
I'm gonna write a letter to Jason Enes myself, and request that girls be put in the next DDR.

157
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,220
As much as that song bugs me, I just think that would be funny.

158
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,220
That's a cool video. A very strange video.

159
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:02,220
Prodigy was famous for that one video, the Smack My Bitch Up video. Is it just as good?

160
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,220
Cause the Smack My Bitch Up video was just, wow.

161
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:09,100
this obviously doesn't help for the people at home but I have it was a

162
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,380
edited version of the video for the first remix of girls I submitted to the

163
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:20,580
cage match the really bad one yeah whatever okay anyways so just to give

164
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:25,660
you an idea I mean this obviously is not going through to listeners but it's just

165
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:31,940
really very strange they've got like some person that looks like a kid with

166
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:36,700
with, like, some army costume and a floating head, giant lips talking. They've got, like,

167
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,780
the Rocky Horror lips mixed with Max Headroom.

168
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,780
Exactly.

169
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:44,180
Did you, like, the Rocky Horror lips speak White Wolf RPGs?

170
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:49,060
And then it just gets even stranger, you know, with this thing moving around and giant lips

171
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:55,060
watching it and... Okay, well, the chat room can't see it, but where could they maybe get

172
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,180
a copy of it? I mean, you got this from somewhere, right?

173
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,820
I believe this was on the, um...

174
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,540
Oh god, who was that? The, um...

175
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,980
It was the group that remixed it.

176
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,540
Uh...

177
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,680
Let me see here. I believe it was

178
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:17,180
the Fake ID's website. It's, um, Fake ID is the band name,

179
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:21,820
and there's a link in their, like, download section to the video.

180
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:25,640
Alright, so if you want to check out Random 80's Flashback to a Cruddy Song,

181
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,400
enjoy

182
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,920

and i dare you i double dog dare you the chat room is very divided there

189
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,480
i triple dog dare you the chat room is very divided, some are yelling at you to do it

190
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,720
Two-headed dog dare you.

191
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,960
Alright, we're gonna get into how was your week, how was your day, but we did have a

192
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,640
newcomer join us during the break there. Not much of a newcomer because she's been at

193
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,240
the show

194
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,840
a gazillion million times. Say hello to DDR Angel. Hello.

195
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,920
And why are you tardy, ma'am?

196
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:18,800
Traffic and stuff. That's no excuse. You should have left earlier. I'm gonna mark that down as a tardy.

197
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,800
Fire! I am not. You lie so bad.

198
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,880
She knows she can get away with it.

199
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:31,280
She brought me, okay, gifts make it better. What'd you bring me, what'd you bring me, what'd you bring me?

200
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:37,080
All is forgiven because I got free stuff.

201
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,760
Ooh, soda. What is this? Diet cherry vanilla Dr. Pepper?

202
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,080
Ew! I've never heard of this. Ew!

203
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,400
It's gross! It sounds interesting. Well, I will be the judge of that.

204
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,400
I will be the judge of that, Miss Thing.

205
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,400
I had it in Alabama.

206
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,400
Oh, okay.

207
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,400
I had this in November.

208
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,400
When I went to Alabama, I was like, oh, that looks neat and interesting,

209
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,400
and the commercials are on the radio all the goddamn time.

210
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,400
I think I'll try one. I had three sips of it.

211
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,400
I gave the rest of it to a homeless person.

212
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,400
He threw it away.

213
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,400
Wait a minute! You gave your soda to a homeless person? How does that work?

214
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,400
Well, I don't know if he was a homeless person. He looked like a beach bum.

215
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,400
It was out of Pensacola.

216
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,400
Loki, comment.

217
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,400
Yeah, because you know I always like taking shitty soda and adding shit to it.

218
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,400
You know, this soda would be just all that better if I put vanilla and cherry in it.

219
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,400
Come on, take a dump in it! It might make it taste even better.

220
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,400
Which actually, though, it really, it tastes...

221
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:51,040
I don't like Dr. Pepper anyway, so I've had this, at least in the Southeast, for a while now.

222
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:55,680
I'm going to go over to the webcam and sample the Diet Cherry Vanilla Dr. Pepper.

223
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,560
I'll have the barf bag ready.

224
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,280
Webcam's over at www.orangetonsready.com.

225
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,120
In the meantime, since, you know, I can't expect everybody to be looking at the webcam,

226
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,880
we'll start off our show as we always do, playing a little bit of how was your week,

227
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,360
how was your day, and Jamie's going to start us off, as always, by letting us know

228
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,360
How was your week?

229
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,360
How was your day?

230
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,360
My week was sick.

231
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,360
As in I've had this cough that hasn't wanted to go away.

232
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,360
I like that.

233
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:28,360
And holiday spice testing is just as nasty.

234
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:37,360
Anyway, I really didn't, you know, it was my last week over in the student loan industry.

235
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,360
Thank God!

236
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:45,020
I swear the VP was kissing my ass the whole time trying to get me to stay and my boss took me out to eat

237
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,020
And oh, this is funny

238
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,500
What do you think?

239
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:56,100
I didn't take a very big sip because the chat room just told us that the webcam isn't up still so we're gonna turn it

240
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,100
On right now and I'll take another sip

241
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,700
All right, um anyway

242
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:11,700
You know, it was kind of a really messed up, sad week, it was a very frustrating week.

243
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,860
And I just didn't have the energy to do much of anything, although I tried step aerobics

244
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,660
and I didn't care for it.

245
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,900
That was like my new thing that I did.

246
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:28,340
Although Friday I took the day off and, oh here we go, but Friday I took the day off

247
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,220
and went to the Skywalker Ranch.

248
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:35,220
I have a friend that works for LucasArts, and she got us into the Skywalker Ranch, so

249
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:39,420
we were going to go, uh oh, I'll wait, I have to see this.

250
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:44,460
Take your drink, suffer!

251
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:53,100
Uh oh.

252
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:59,260
It really just tastes like regular Dr. Pepper to me, with like a funny flavor to it.

253
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:03,260
I can't explain. It's not cherry or vanilla. It's just hilarity.

254
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,460
It's Dr. Pepper flavored with hilarity.

255
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:13,460
And the aftertaste is...

256
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:17,300
Dr. Pepper vaginal juice mix.

257
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,500
Anyway, I went to the Skywalker Ranch.

258
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,660
Ate some very, very good food. Man, their employees have it good.

259
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:28,140
Their employee cafeteria has, like, the best food in it.

260
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:35,420
I had like what and is there a little like bulletin board on the back there

261
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:42,500
it says you know so many days since we've altered Star Wars again you know

262
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:47,700
speaking of altering Star Wars we're sitting there at our table eaten all of

263
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:53,060
a sudden guess who walks by behind us but George Lucas himself and the

264
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:56,940
business associate discussing things I hope you flick your mashed potatoes Adam

265
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:02,940
I didn't eat mashed potatoes. I really wanted to flick my meatloaf at him, but the meatloaf was really good and I didn't want to ruin it.

266
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,940
You might have gotten kicked out too, but it would have been worth it.

267
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:12,940
But we next went and raided the employee store, so I actually have an episode 3 hoodie.

268
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:18,940
Just because I really wanted a hoodie, and I figured episode 3 hoodie, nobody else has one unless they work there, so hey, cool.

269
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,940
Oh, you're special!

270
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,940
Well, I just figured it was an opportunity.

271
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,940
Well, I know you don't like to go on cam, but can we model your hoodie?

272
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,940
Yeah, I suppose.

273
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,940
I'll model your hoodie.

274
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,940
Okay, model my hoodie.

275
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:38,940
I also got an ILM shirt and on the back it says Visual Arts Crew, which I thought was really nifty.

276
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,940
You better watch out, it smells like me.

277
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:46,940
It smells like camo, which is what I'm really wearing.

278
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,940
It's upside down, Rob.

279
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,940
And backwards.

280
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,940
Oh, you're just infinitely amusing.

281
00:23:52,940 --> 00:24:00,940
Hold the hood back and hold it out by the shoulders, there you go.

282
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,940
See, I'm cool.

283
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:11,300
Anyway, we also, I got a really nice leather business folder for Dan.

284
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:16,500
And we actually got everything, all this expensive shit, at half price because one of our friends,

285
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,940
because our friend was of course with us.

286
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:23,920
And I also had a latte made by a $10,000 latte machine.

287
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,300
And it was like a really damn good latte, too.

288
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,500
It was like professional and shit.

289
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,160
It was really yummy.

290
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:36,480
And so we sat in this sort of lounge area, enjoying our latte.

291
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,700
They had a bunch of old Star Wars and Indiana Jones toys in there, because we went by the

292
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,920
marketing director's office.

293
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,920
The licensing director.

294
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,920
That was it.

295
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,920
I just want to clarify, the food was better than episode one?

296
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,920
Yes, incredibly. The food was excellent. The movie was not.

297
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,920
We didn't get a chance, we sort of were too stunned to go mob

298
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,920
the man and say, hey Jorge, what was wrong with your head?

299
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,920
And it was funny, we

300
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,920
were talking to a couple of the receptionists there, just seeing who all they've

301
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:12,920
met and everything. It was like, oh, a George sighting!

302
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:17,740
was kind of funny. Nothing beats watching a really shitty Star Wars movie that's been

303
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:23,000
bootlegged with really shitty subtitles. Like for instance, you know, lines like, you'll

304
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:30,000
be the desert of me. Or, sup Yoda. That's funny. Sup Yoda. But, you know, after that

305
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:40,080
we took a trip to Network Video, because our friends still had to work, and at Network

306
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:47,640
video we made some purchases. We bought Saturn AV cables. We bought Street Fighter Alpha

307
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:54,040
for the US Saturn, because we didn't have it believe it or not. I have to ask, how many

308
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:59,720
times do you actually play these games after you buy them? I play them. Actually I also

309
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:05,160
bought a Japanese game for the GameCube. Oh what game? Dobutsu no Mori, which was Animal

310
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:09,680
Crossing in the US. Oh! And the whole reason I was basically peeing in my pants the whole

311
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:17,240
time went in this game was because I thought, because you know in the US one it says each

312
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:23,040
individual letter when they're talking, but people usually go through it and I was like

313
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:30,860
okay well you can't really understand the letters and on some movie files I had of people

314
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:33,560
playing the Japanese version I thought they were just speeding through it because they

315
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,480
were saying it all so fast but I could tell that they were saying each of the kana. So

316
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:41,780
So I thought, well, maybe if I let it go slow, I'll hear what they're saying and can use

317
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:46,200
it as practice for, you know, my comprehension, because that's the whole reason I want it,

318
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,960
is because all of the text in the game is in hiragana, so I don't have to worry about

319
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,000
reading any kanji, because, like, one of the 30 kanji I know is in the title.

320
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,660
Wait, now, I'm kind of curious.

321
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:02,880
I thought that Animal Crossing was first on the Nintendo 64 in Japan, called Animal Forest.

322
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,880
I found the GameCube in, it was like, like Animal Forest special or something.

323
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,880
Okay, see now I thought that you had picked it up for the Nintendo 64, the old school one, okay.

324
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,880
You don't really own a whole lot of Nintendo 64 stuff, do you?

325
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,880
I don't even think we own a 64 anymore. We borrow, we have one somewhere.

326
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,880
Really? I thought you, you were on a mission to collect as many systems as possible.

327
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,880
Well yeah, but we, I think we gave ours away to somebody who really wanted to play it.

328
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,880
A homeless person?

329
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:32,880
Oh, yeah. Here's a Star Fox 64.

330
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,880
That would be great to go downtown and find a homeless person.

331
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,880
Go find a homeless person and give them a Nintendo 64.

332
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,880
What the fuck am I going to do with this?

333
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,880
I put it into my disappointment. They spoke just as fast as they did in the thing.

334
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:58,480
did in the thing. But it's actually neat because I like how you enter your text. Instead of

335
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,000
having to go to that little screen where you choose your letters, instead you use your

336
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:10,800
analog pad. Because the quote alphabet is done in a series of, like you have five in

337
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:16,000
each group. Like, a, i, u, e, o, ma, mi, mu, me, mo, sa, shi, tsu, te, to, like that.

338
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,880
But the way that you do is you pick each of the first ones in the group, the ah sound

339
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,360
like, you can pick the ah group or mah group or sah group, like that, and then you choose

340
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,340
that on your analog pad, and then it pulls up all of the ones in that one, so you choose

341
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,840
everything with your analog pad.

342
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,720
It's very, very smart.

343
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,040
And I mean, it wouldn't work for English, of course, which is probably why they changed

344
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,360
it, but it was, it makes it a lot easier.

345
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,920
I'm so looking forward to Animal Crossing on the DS, though.

346
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:51,600
Oh, so am I. But also I'm looking forward to actually being able to play Zelda and Mario

347
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:59,200
without having a code. Because they were just, you could dig them up in the dirt. But, um,

348
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,680
I figured it'll help me with my learning. You know, and I did a pretty decent job reading

349
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:09,920
it through, uh, through, uh, with, uh, what was his face? I can't believe I forgot his

350
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:20,040
name, but the dog. Yeah, KK. Oh, Tom Nook? No, I'm trying to remember his actual name.

351
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:26,640
Toda KK. Oh, okay. That's it, Toda KK. But I had a pretty good time with that, and then

352
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:33,240
yesterday I went over to Iguana Girl's house and we played lots of 8 style and lots of

353
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:41,760
Popit9. I have to thank Raichan for selling me your Popit9, and Navi for selling me his

354
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:48,480
controller, which still works beautifully, I might add. And my five-year-old 2DX controller

355
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,920
still functions as perfectly as when I opened the box now.

356
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,120
You lucky bitch. Mine's broke as hell.

357
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,360
We've only cleaned it out twice.

358
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,280
I tried to clean mine out like five times, as though it was on.

359
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,560
This is the last time we actually took it out and actually cleaned the circuit board.

360
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:06,120
And it was, it's almost flawless now, and you can tell it's kind of old.

361
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,200
But we played lots of 8th style, it was pretty fun.

362
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,600
And then we had Musical Night, where we watched Little Shop of Horrors and Chicago.

363
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,600
Didn't you guys go see Phantom?

364
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,600
No, we didn't.

365
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,600
Aww.

366
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,600
But I'm going to go see it tomorrow with Tia.

367
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,600
Okay.

368
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,720
But I have to say this about Chicago, this is the first movie I really liked that I hated

369
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,520
all the characters in.

370
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,720
I hate every single damn character in that movie.

371
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,880
I hated the blonde, whoever.

372
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,880
Renee Zellweger?

373
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,200
Yes, and I hated Catherine Zeta-Jones' character a whole lot.

374
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:42,840
I liked the ballerina girl who got, you know...

375
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,840
Spoilers.

376
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,840
I'm not gonna spoil.

377
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,840
Okay, but...

378
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,840
The one that didn't speak English!

379
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,840
She was nice.

380
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,800
You, of all people, must have loved that song where they talked about killing all their

381
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,800
boyfriends.

382
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,800
Oh yeah, that was my favorite.

383
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:04,000
I also liked the whole scene with the courtroom with the tap dance. The thing is that I really

384
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,720
loved the cinematography in the movie. I like how they integrated all the song numbers with

385
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:16,320
the reality. I loved the music, I loved the songs, everybody sang well, but I hated every

386
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:22,440
single last character and the character I hated the most was the woman's husband. I

387
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:34,440
I don't feel sorry for him at all. The guy asked for it. He was a big, stupid sap the whole damn time, and if he had any balls to him, he would have divorced her that moment. He wouldn't have done anything he would have said. Excuse me, bitch!

388
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,440
Okay.

389
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,440
You're quite feisty tonight. I'm enjoying this.

390
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,440
I am in a mood.

391
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,440
I'm enjoying this.

392
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,440
But I'm going to go see Phantom Demaris. I'm happy.

393
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,440
I'll tell you my favorite character in the whole movie, and this is totally the gay in me talking, but I don't care.

394
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,840
When you're good to mama, mama's good to you.

395
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,840
That was actually, I have to say that's my second favorite song in it.

396
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,840
She has a really nice voice. I would have never expected Queen Latifah to be

397
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,840
in that role, but she's awesome. I heard her sing at the Oscars,

398
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,440
because they televised that, and that's actually the only part of the Oscars I watched that year.

399
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,840
Was just to hear her sing. Because she filled in for, um, what's her name? Because she was pregnant.

400
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:16,440
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right. She did very good. I never realized just, like, what a great voice Queen Latifah has.

401
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:22,680
mm-hmm very good voice but um one thing though that I really I have to say this

402
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,920
though costuming wise is that they should not have put Renee Zelligler in

403
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,800
some of those clothes because she just doesn't have the figure for it you know

404
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,760
I remember originally like a boy Madonna was supposed to be in that movie that

405
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,800
would have been interesting she would have been really good in that role too

406
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,160
that would have been I think well actually she was she was supposed to be

407
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:45,560
the Catherine Zeta-Jones one oh really huh yeah I don't know but it cares you

408
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,560
You guys are here to listen about video games, and here we are talking musicals.

409
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:53,560
But the thing is, is that we didn't watch, believe it or not, we did not watch Rocky.

410
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,560
Really?

411
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,560
We had a musical night and didn't watch Rocky.

412
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,560
So, that was my week.

413
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:08,440
Yeah, I have issues with certain things, so I didn't like anybody in that damn movie.

414
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,520
Not a one.

415
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,520
Not a one.

416
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,520
That's alright.

417
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,520
Okay, I'm done.

418
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,520
You're done?

419
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,520
Alright.

420
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:21,520
I was actually going to see, I thought I actually had the When You're Good to Mama song from Chicago, I was going to play a little clip, but I can't find it, so.

421
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:26,520
Our listeners are spared from musical night. That'd be great, we should have musical night.

422
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,520
Dude, do you have the husband killing song?

423
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,520
I had it somewhere, I don't know where it is though.

424
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,520
Oh no, we should play that during a break if you haven't.

425
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:38,520
Maybe during the afterbirth, even though we don't really have an afterbirth anymore, but we'll see.

426
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,520
We need to play that.

427
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:44,520
I'll see what I can find. You know what? I will find it for you and you can use it as a fortune cookie next week, maybe.

428
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:50,520
Okay. I want to go find the... Okay, I'm going to download it when I get home. I'm going to find the soundtrack and play Tuesday.

429
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:55,520
Oh, there you go. I'm going to look forward to it. I'll pop up the volume. You want to pop up the volume real fast, Jamie?

430
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:03,520
Hey, pop up the volume is Tuesday. Tune the hell in. At six... I'm sorry. This would be at seven o'clock for the pre-show, but eh.

431
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,520
I'll usually start around six forty-five. Because I'm bored.

432
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:16,520
0blivixx, as much as it pains me to move away from musicals, we're going to talk to Loki for a minute and ask Loki, how was your week, how was your day?

433
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:41,740
to get for not remembering where I put stuff and then I don't know the week was

434
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:45,780
okay up till about Friday to where I found out that I fucked up big time at

435
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:53,140
work so now I gotta talk to my boss on Monday that sucks and then what else I

436
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:57,820
went out to dinner last night to Tahoe Joe's and they're okay but their

437
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:02,620
mashed potatoes taste like shit other than that their food was decent I'd

438
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:07,420
probably I don't really like going back there because I don't know there's a lot

439
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:11,660
of stuff I didn't like about him but whatever it was fun to try because I had

440
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:18,540
a gift certificate so you know free there then other than that really not

441
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:28,100
too much going on supposedly gonna get a was it a raise well not really raised

442
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:57,100
But bonus on Thursday. Assuming I don't get fired by then. And, um, yeah. I don't remember if I mentioned this last week, because I can't remember exactly when in the timeline this took place, but apparently the store chain that I do customer service for, Movie Gallery, purchased Hollywood Video, in which case they're probably going to go to self-distribution, which I don't see how that's possible, considering they're retarded. So that means I might be out of a job.

443
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:05,700
job anyways. But, no, they just relocate me to some customer service job. No thanks. Basically,

444
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:10,700
I know of at least nine people personally in our company that are leaving soon because

445
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:18,780
everyone's fed up with it. So, it's just interesting. But, yeah, I'm sure this mistake. See, basically

446
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:24,580
what happened was I had to do this price check, this giant price check for 3,000 items and

447
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:28,100
stuff and because movie galleries retarded and they don't have any

448
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:33,900
information to give me whatsoever they have like old UPCs and titles so the

449
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:38,300
only way I could do it to match it to items in our system is I had to title

450
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,540
match everything to stuff that we had in our system so in order to do that make a

451
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:47,180
mock order so basically after spending seven straight hours title matching

452
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:52,700
which I might add you it's very draining and very tedious I finally got done and

453
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:56,700
And so I submitted the stuff off to them, and, you know, they were happy. They were like,

454
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:03,700
Wow, we wouldn't have had you do it if, you know, we knew it was going to take that long, or, you know, it was going to be that much work. So, yay.

455
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:13,700
But, you know, because I was worn out or whatever, I somehow forgot to delete the order, so one of each of these 3,000 titles or whatever came into one of our branches.

456
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:23,700
I think that mistake cost the company, well, right now it's costing them about, I don't know, a couple, I don't know, tens of thousands of dollars.

457
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:31,700
Which in the grand scheme of things isn't that much, considering they can turn around and return all this stuff, but they're just making a big deal about it right now.

458
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:45,700
Um, I don't know why, but, you know, whatever. So, that's that. And so I gotta deal with that on Monday. Fun, fun. And, um, yeah. So that was pretty much my week. Um, kinda sucked.

459
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:59,700
But, uh, yeah. So, I gotta be looking for a new job anyways, because, uh, you know, this one isn't doing a very good job paying the bills. I need more money. And besides, they're not moving me anywhere, so.

460
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,700
Yep, need out.

461
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,700
So that's pretty much all that happened.

462
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,700
I don't want that in the law of Final Fantasy.

463
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:11,700
Oh, I did have one thing to say since you said the evil addict word.

464
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,700
Yes?

465
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:19,700
Because the copies literally fell onto my lap.

466
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,700
No, this was fate saying something.

467
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,700
I was doing some cleaning out of some drawers.

468
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:30,420
And onto my lap fall a series of discs in a box.

469
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:34,480
Right next to them is a book that has certain key codes in it.

470
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,940
And right next to that was a little notepad with all my passwords on it.

471
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:42,020
So I'm going to be rejoining the stupid world.

472
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,020
Of?

473
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,420
Stupid addict game.

474
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:48,180
You mean you're going to sign up for Final Fantasy XI?

475
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,460
Because I'm canceling AOL.

476
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,460
Addict!

477
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,460
No, not really.

478
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:59,460
It's multiple purposes for me and that and the fact that Gravity has turned into a bunch of retards.

479
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:03,460
So I'm actually going to quit Final Fantasy XI when Ragnarok II comes out.

480
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:07,460
They turned into? Meaning they weren't before?

481
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:10,460
They got increasingly stupid.

482
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:18,460
Because I was thinking about rejoining RO and World of Warcraft and when they filled up their servers in two weeks I just decided no.

483
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:22,980
You may remember back to when, uh, Lanky Style and I used to impersonate the, uh, Gravity

484
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:23,980
personnel.

485
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,700
You want to talk bad about company?

486
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,900
We ban you!

487
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,700
You want to have bots on our server?

488
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,700
Ban!

489
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,700
Yeah.

490
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,500
So, I, you know, why not?

491
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:42,360
And I have people to play with, and I figured I'm probably gonna be so bombarded with school

492
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:47,580
and everything else, it, it's gonna, it'll be a good distraction.

493
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:53,400
The nice thing is that Angel plays on Final Fantasy XI now, and I love Angel because she

494
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,520
is such our bitch.

495
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,520
And she will be your bitch, too.

496
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,520
Yeah, okay, I had to choke a ball all the way over to the dunes last night because somebody

497
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:06,120
forgot apple pie, so I just grabbed a stack and said, okay, you want to?

498
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,120
Yes, please!

499
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,120
Okay, fine.

500
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,120
I'm gonna go get you some.

501
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,120
Now, for those that don't play Final Fantasy XI, I went whoosh, but it's her angel carbine.

502
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,160
And if you hold your hand over your head, you might catch it.

503
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:20,520
See mine would have been I would have been like fuck that you should have been prepared fuck that you have the deal without it

504
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,020
But I need to know what to start off with if I want to get to a ranger like what job

505
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:30,160
These damn it. I mean that's a bill all that beef shit up again

506
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,200
Maybe thief or warrior maybe warrior

507
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,320
Anything because we're gonna want to do is beat

508
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:44,020
Ranger ninja anyways, so you just I guess warrior to start off with because they'll be the easiest you just hit shit

509
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:47,020
It's pretty much it. It can't get any easier than that.

510
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,020
I want Thief's stuff to get money.

511
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:54,020
Well, I was just thinking that, you know, I just thought, ah, Ninja stuff is hella expensive.

512
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:57,020
Then I thought, wait a minute, Ranger's the most expensive in the game, never mind.

513
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:59,020
Do you think there's not any merchant class like there is in Ragnarok?

514
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,020
Yeah, merchants are our own.

515
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,020
You just go outside and...pedal.

516
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:06,020
Well, maybe they'll add something to Final Fantasy XI in the future, but...

517
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:09,020
I don't want to turn this into Final Fantasy XI chat, we're bad enough to...

518
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:12,020
Anyway, I figured that I would mention the decision, so...

519
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:16,020
Should I bring up that Gravity thing since she kind of mentioned it?

520
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,020
Sure!

521
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:24,020
Um, Gravity came out with a new game that has like the same sound effects as Ragnarok, which was kind of weird.

522
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:27,020
It's called, uh, Rose? I don't know if you've heard about it, Jamie?

523
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:30,020
Yes I have, and I've actually signed up for an account on Rose Online.

524
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:33,020
I've got one as well, so we can play there too.

525
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,020
Rose Rock Online.

526
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:40,020
There he is. We're gonna just change the name of this person.

527
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,140
I'm a pirate on an airship!

528
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,660
How rad is that?

529
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,400
I forgot what it stands for, though.

530
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,660
My brain drew a blank.

531
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,900
Something of seven events.

532
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:55,520
If you want to be pirates, you better follow rules or we ban you! We make you walk plank!

533
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,140
I think it's Road of Seven Events or something.

534
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,180
What extent did you do in this game?

535
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:03,820
It's just like Ragnarok, but it's 3D.

536
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,060
Yeah, 3D and...

537
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,660
Yeah, there you go.

538
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:11,860
It's just like Ragnarok, but it's more 3D, and it's cool, and, yeah.

539
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:15,340
So, yeah, more game stuff.

540
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:18,140
Now, this time when you sign up, you're going to be a good girl and go with

541
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:20,140
Sandorria, as opposed to Bastok, right?

542
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:24,340
I suppose. I had my way around Bastok pretty damn well, because I kept

543
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:27,140
dying. Or, as we call it, Lastok.

544
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:30,380
Maybe I'll go to Winters.

545
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,740
Winters, it's the only problem with Winters, is that you get lost

546
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:38,740
Oh my god, it went back to Final Fantasy XI chat! Bad host! Bad! Bad! Bad!

547
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,740
The hell was your week, Rob?

548
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:45,740
Well, I'm so glad you asked, Jamie. Were you done, Loki? I'm sorry.

549
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:52,740
Uh, yeah, well, Winter sucks because it's so big. Stop it now! Stop now!

550
00:42:52,740 --> 00:43:03,420
Now, my week and my day were pretty good, I guess. I also played a lot of that unmentionable

551
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:08,060
game a bit this week. And I'm looking forward to tonight, because I'm actually going to

552
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:12,020
be going out tonight, and I'm going to the golf club. You know, we joked about this on

553
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:16,020
the show a few weeks ago before, you know, last time I went. Usually when a three-day

554
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:20,620
weekend comes up, Rob does one of two things. Either Rob drinks on the show, or Rob goes

555
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:24,220
to the goth club so tonight I opted for goth club because guana girl's gonna meet me out

556
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:27,920
there because she hasn't been to the goth club for a while so we're gonna go and as

557
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,020
you can see I'm dressed in all black right now and I'll go model on the cam again in

558
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:41,420
a minute and we're just gonna go and we're gonna look sit in the corner and look tragic.

559
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,260
You're gonna goth serve.

560
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:47,300
We're totally gonna goth serve people, that'd be great.

561
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:49,880
And what else did I do this week?

562
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:54,820
I played a little bit of Technic Beat today, which is a game I'm starting to grow really

563
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:58,580
fond of. It's such a cute little game. I can't wait to rip some of the music and play it

564
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:02,540
for you guys, those of you guys that haven't heard it yet. Some of the remixes of like

565
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:08,360
Pac-Man and Tower of Druaga and Mappy! Oh my god, Mappy! The Mappy theme rules. And

566
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:18,360
it's in the genre of Happy Handbag, which makes me think of Sylvia Drive. Alright, anyway.

567
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,360
And then what?

568
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,360
What else is going on this week?

569
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:24,800
Oh yeah, I hung out yesterday with Rice Princess, because she doesn't ever come to Thursday's

570
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,000
show anymore, it seems.

571
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,680
So we actually got to hang out earlier this week, and our buddy Christopher.

572
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:34,240
And we watched some anime yesterday, and you guys know I don't watch anime a whole lot,

573
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:39,640
but we actually watched Ranma, one half again, and I got to see the first couple episodes.

574
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:44,000
And it's one of those animes I actually enjoy, I think it's so cute, it makes me laugh.

575
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,080
And we were going to play Metroid Prime 2 Echoes, because I'm really curious to check

576
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:52,200
out that game. But, I don't know, we ran out of time. We ended up watching A Mighty Wind

577
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:59,220
instead. Go figure. And then, well, Christopher made us watch episodes of Upright Citizens

578
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:04,400
Brigade, which was this old show that was on Comedy Central a couple of years ago. It

579
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,880
was actually kind of funny. Like, some of it was really funny. The concept, I really

580
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,400
liked the concept. Some of the humor was a little, like it was hit and miss, but I thought

581
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:18,200
the concept was great, and the girl in that show rocks. Anyway, I guess that's pretty

582
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:22,520
much it for my week of my day. I didn't do anything that exciting game-wise, except that

583
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,160
one game.

584
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:28,440
Actually, speaking of anime, a friend of mine got me onto an anime lately. I've been watching

585
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,000
Fruits Basket. It's cute. I didn't think I'd like it.

586
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,600
I just pulled back the whole box.

587
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,600
Ah, you meanie!

588
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,600
Oh well, tough.

589
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,600
I would've bought it from you.

590
00:45:35,600 --> 00:46:04,600
The best character is Kyo, because he's violent. I like violence. That's all.

591
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:08,760
and no I'm not watching Naruto because everybody in the goddamn universe is

592
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:13,360
watching Naruto I don't watch it I've been reading the manga I don't watch it

593
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:17,120
but I don't watch like any anime the fact that they got me to watch Ranma is

594
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:24,440
you know amazing so anyway moving on Bradley Arcadian 42 our quiet man in the

595
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:29,280
corner there how was your week how was your day my week was just a regular old

596
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:36,800
week work and not much else though I've had for like the past two weeks I've had

597
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:42,440
crappy cold and sniffly and coffee and all this kind of crap kind of by the

598
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:49,080
same stuff that Jamie said it's kind of it's annoying this weekend I played some

599
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:55,520
old-school Super Nintendo games played a Actraiser and played Link to the Past

600
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,520
Those are two very sexy games.

601
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:01,520
Yes. And that's about everything I did.

602
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,520
If it's of any interest at all.

603
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,520
On to the next.

604
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,520
I was just thinking about Actraiser for a minute.

605
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,520
And what a great game that is.

606
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,520
What? What dark side, Cora?

607
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:18,520
I don't know. People keep mentioning stuff that makes me remember the stuff I did during the week.

608
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:21,520
What did you two think of now?

609
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,520
Last night, falling asleep watching Dan play Metroid.

610
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,520
Super Metroid or like old school?

611
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,520
Metroid.

612
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,520
Oh, that's odd.

613
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,520
And Bionic Commando.

614
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,520
Man.

615
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,520
Watching Hitler blow up.

616
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,520
All these sexy games.

617
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,520
We need to have like a sexy retro night.

618
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,520
No, if you're going to do that though, I'm going to be bringing over...

619
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,520
Sexy cabinet.

620
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,520
Sexy retro games on.

621
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,520
Nah.

622
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,520
I'll bring over Sexy Parodius.

623
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,520
I'll bring over the...

624
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,520
Sexy Parodius.

625
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,520
Sexy Parodius didn't have an arcade release.

626
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,520
I think we need to play...

627
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,520
This is what we're going to play.

628
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:26,520
I just thought of one, but you're gonna hit me, so never mind.

629
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:30,520
You'd be playing Guardian Legend, and then I'd take the controller and show you how to play Guardian Legend.

630
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:34,520
Ooh! Oh, snap!

631
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:38,520
The only levels I actually couldn't beat, there were 10 and 20. It was difficult.

632
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:42,520
I think I got about that far, and then I stopped, but

633
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:46,520
Guardian Legend, oh man. Seriously, I know some of you guys are kind of new to

634
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:50,520
the show, and you haven't heard us gush about Guardian Legend before, but it is seriously the greatest

635
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:55,840
this 8-bit game ever made, at least in my big fat opinion. It's part shooter, part Zelda,

636
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:01,680
part bliss. Angel, how was your week? How was your day?

637
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:07,680
Pretty good. Had to get ready for school and stuff because that starts this week, yay.

638
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:11,720
Didn't play too, too much of that evil game that everyone, that I can't mention now because

639
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:20,560
you're gonna fire me right lots of well I played a little bit of it but whatever

640
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:27,020
um other than that not too too much I do have to work tomorrow though don't so

641
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:35,080
yuck I don't yeah well oh well yeah see Loki does uh not too much

642
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:41,080
other than that oh and um life journal went down this week did any if anybody

643
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:46,600
knew about that for 24 hours oh my god my world ended when live journal

644
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,720
collapsed no I'm kidding it didn't but seriously did you notice how many people

645
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:56,240
suddenly were like I have to go outside live journals town yeah that was that

646
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:00,720
was pretty funny cuz as soon as it came back up all of my friends were going oh

647
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,600
my god I couldn't live without life you know oh my god it's back up what is it

648
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:09,680
as soon as it went back up everybody was posting about it and whatever so

649
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,240
everyone had their withdrawal. I only jumped on just to see

650
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:17,960
you know, what friendsists were doing and all that stuff

651
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:21,120
and to see if a certain other show was going on but

652
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:26,780
I couldn't do that because LiveJournal was down, so. Speaking of LiveJournal, what an

653
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:28,840
excellent chance to plug our community.

654
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:32,600
We actually have a LiveJournal community. It's username OrangeLounge. Check it out.

655
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:36,360
That's really difficult to remember. Some of us though had dead journals to go to.

656
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:41,360
And dead journal, and dead journals that never get used unless live journal's down, right?

657
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,360
Exactly.

658
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,360
Alright, fair enough.

659
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:47,360
Um, let's see, so that's it for your weekend day?

660
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:52,360
Before I forget, I forgot to mention the website for that Rose game.

661
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,360
It's roseon.com, it's all one word.

662
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,360
Alright.

663
00:50:55,360 --> 00:51:00,360
I love the chatroom, I'm sorry because I don't know who said this first,

664
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:05,360
but another game at our sexy retro game-a-thon where you guys are going to sit around and watch me play games.

665
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:11,640
play games. Um, Blaster Master, you guys can sit around and watch me play Blaster Master

666
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,880
because that would be probably the second best 8-bit game ever made.

667
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:21,800
That's when I actually bring over the collection, and uh, and I have to say, the collection.

668
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:25,120
Yeah, and then we can sit around and talk about how much the other Blaster Master games

669
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,120
sucked.

670
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:31,680
And bring over all of, all of the Mega Man games to date up to, I think, I think I have

671
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:39,600
up through X4 on Saturn and then I have like a I think five and six and then

672
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:44,940
that's it but I have all of the NES ones. You know what would be great I I will

673
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:48,700
still I will never forget this one of the very first times I met Dark Zakra I

674
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:52,000
went to her house actually because I got invited to her house like pretty quick

675
00:51:52,000 --> 00:52:00,240
and when I walked in there was like five TVs and everybody was playing The Legend

676
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:04,320
as Zelda, and the old school 8-bit Legend of Zelda on all these TV's. They were having

677
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:08,200
the speed beat. Yeah, and I guess what was going on is that they were seeing who could

678
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:13,640
beat Legend of Zelda the fastest. Five TV's in the living room and dining room. And there

679
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:18,400
was one person playing Splatterhouse. I noticed that, the one random person. I have no idea

680
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:23,520
why but there was one random Splatterhouse. All these guys in the house playing Zelda

681
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,300
and yelling and screaming, it was awesome, I was in heaven. And didn't you call that

682
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:31,460
a LAN party, a local area Nintendo party? Yeah, that was a LAN party, a local area Nintendo.

683
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:34,240
Now next time- And they did the same with Mega Man 2 after. I was gonna say, you need

684
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:39,240
to do something like that, but on each TV have a different Mega Man game. That'd be

685
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:46,320
so hot. Watching Andrew do that in an hour was like, scary as hell. I'm going, holy crap!

686
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:52,620
But that's Andrew for you, he's a Mega Man boy. I've done the um, the uh, the dragon

687
00:52:52,620 --> 00:53:00,620
level of, uh, of, uh, I've actually beat the dragon on Mega Man 2 blindfolded.

688
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:07,780
That's hot. I can't do it now, but when I played that game all the damn time, I had

689
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:11,700
all of my jumps, it's like basically when you get to the platform right before you jump,

690
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:15,740
that's when I was blindfolded, and I made all my jumps, hit it up there, and knew exactly

691
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:20,060
where all my jumps were. I could see, like, I could just picture it in my mind, Jamie

692
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:24,640
sitting there in her camo with the blindfold on and the controller in her hand and a candy

693
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,220
cigarette in her mouth, cause not a real one cause she doesn't smoke, but a candy cigarette

694
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:31,820
in her mouth, just sitting there, bringing it on.

695
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:32,820
Whatever.

696
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:33,820
The only other game...

697
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,780
It's like a non-flashback or something.

698
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:42,260
The only other game I can play blindfolded is level 81 on Super Mario Brothers.

699
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,860
Dark Knight says Jamie was like Zen.

700
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:48,060
You channeled your Zen warrior power.

701
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:49,340
That is supreme geekness.

702
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:52,340
I didn't even know I had any when I was twelve.

703
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:58,340
Alright, uh, and then I'm being poked fun of in the chat room for going over to a girl's house.

704
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:02,340
Don't you know they have cooties?

705
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:04,340
Don't you know they have cooties?

706
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:08,340
Do you remember the one guy who had his computer case built out of a toolbox?

707
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:09,340
Yes.

708
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:10,340
That was cool.

709
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:14,340
He knows a camo toolbox.

710
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:23,860
Okay, I'm just, I'm waller-ing in geek right now, this is funny. Alright, moving on. Umm,

711
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:29,340
Explicit joined us, he walked in during the break, also Tardy there, Mr. Tardy. Yeah,

712
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:32,140
alright. Well, Explicit, how was your week, how was your day?

713
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:38,620
It was pretty cool, I liked it. Some ups and downs, but most likely ups.

714
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:39,620
Any games you were playing this week?

715
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:47,620
Well, I finished Metroid Prime 2 in like, in like one week. That's about it.

716
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:50,620
I'm beating Final Fantasy II.

717
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,620
The Dawn of Souls one? Okay.

718
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:54,620
In three days.

719
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:59,620
Jeez. I feel like I can't touch Final Fantasy II until I beat Final Fantasy I.

720
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:04,620
II is a bitch to level up on. You have to get used to the system.

721
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:09,620
I hear you can do something in the beginning, though. Make it really easy. Like, you level up your characters uber strong in the beginning.

722
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:12,620
That's if you have enough time in your hands to cheat and level up so you can...

723
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:14,620
There's always time for cheating!

724
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:18,620
Oh, yeah. I'll explain that on the FUs.

725
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:19,620
Alright.

726
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:22,620
Anything else going on with your week?

727
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:27,620
Oh, man, I was thinking of getting into a relationship with a close friend of mine, and you know that's about it.

728
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:30,620
Relations, huh?

729
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:32,620
That's cool.

730
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:34,620
You've been having relations.

731
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:40,620
And also, updates on the tournament on February 5th.

732
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:43,620
Okay, you're having a tournament in SACTO February 5th?

733
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,620
SACTO SmackDown, February 5th.

734
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:46,620
I love these Jesus tournament names.

735
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:52,620
Or some people call it PISS because it says Paradise Island SACTO SmackDown.

736
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:57,620
Paradise Island SACTO SmackDown, you're calling your tournament PISS?

737
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:58,620
No, it was not expected.

738
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:02,860
Scat. Okay, but scat was funny, but piss is really funny.

739
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:06,300
It was not expected, I was just like, oh my gosh.

740
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:10,140
And now, for the golden shower round!

741
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:14,500
Where we shower you with gold!

742
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:18,780
Can I co-emcee that tournament or something?

743
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:22,820
Go ahead. So I can come out and then throw gold glitter in the air and say,

744
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:26,820
it's a golden shower here at piss!

745
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:29,320
Go ahead, do whatever you want in the tournament.

746
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,320
Hahahaha!

747
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:34,320
Hahahaha!

748
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:37,320
I'm sorry, this is so seventh grade but I don't care.

749
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,320
Do the posters say piss?

750
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:42,820
No, um, chaos is what I came up with.

751
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:44,820
It's like, ooh, it spells piss.

752
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:46,320
And that's a sack-tail smackdown.

753
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,820
I was actually trying to prevent the word from saying ass.

754
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:49,820
Oh, right.

755
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:52,320
Like a sack-tail smackdown but now it says piss.

756
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,320
Yeah, you know, ass would have been-

757
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:56,320
Ass is looking pretty good right now, huh?

758
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:00,320
That's the only time I'm going to get him to admit it.

759
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,320
Oh my gosh.

760
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:03,320
Alright.

761
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:04,320
That's great.

762
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,320
What kind of tournaments are you having again at PISS?

763
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:10,320
Okay, it starts at eleven or twelve o'clock.

764
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,320
It will contain DDRPA, which is-

765
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:16,320
THE PISS BEGINS AT NOON.

766
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:20,320
I long did.

767
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:23,320
Oh my gosh.

768
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:25,320
I think I just killed Sky on this one.

769
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:30,320
So will you be starting off on heavy and then working your way to light?

770
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:33,320
Actually that's two divisions.

771
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:36,320
The perfect piss.

772
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:39,320
And the freestyle piss.

773
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:46,320
Oh my god.

774
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:49,320
The first round of course is a PA.

775
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:57,320
The first one will determine if you're going to the intermediate or the expert division, if you're applicable.

776
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:00,320
Hopefully you'll make it unless you really like the lowest seed.

777
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:05,320
Oh my gosh.

778
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,320
What the hell?

779
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,320
Oh my god.

780
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:19,320
Did you finally taste that piss in the bottle?

781
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:22,320
Fucking Dr. Pepper nasty shit?

782
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,320
It finally hit you?

783
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,320
Honestly, because that stuff looks nasty.

784
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:33,320
Diet Dr. Pepper cherry vanilla ass juice.

785
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:36,320
For those that couldn't see what just happened,

786
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:40,320
I had one of those moments where I was about to laugh really really hard

787
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:44,320
because Loki just gave me that look of I'm thinking something really funny right now.

788
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:49,660
and I had to run over to the kitchen sink and spit out the drink so and I was

789
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:55,220
of course drinking that Dr. Pepper. I'm sorry I'm sorry explicit go ahead and finish.

790
00:58:55,220 --> 00:59:03,640
It's alright. Everyone's all cracking up with the title piss. Okay there's also there's also

791
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:09,520
initial D version 3 tournaments for those interested in wasting their cars.

792
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:14,320
so that should be it's also gonna be held at the same time with DDR PA as

793
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:20,360
well so time goes faster and there's a freestyle at six o'clock this should be

794
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:24,580
pretty interesting a two-rounded DDR freestyle the first round is an improv

795
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:32,520
improv with a prop you get to use a prop so you know the initial D term in there

796
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:35,520
You can actually call the I'd piss because you know.

797
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:38,520
Oh my god.

798
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:41,520
The initial D, Paradise Island, Sacktown Smackdown.

799
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:43,520
Two.

800
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,520
Oh my god.

801
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:48,520
Whatever. Okay, I'm done with the piss jokes.

802
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:52,520
I'm sorry. We will bury the piss jokes, but you have to admit it's funny.

803
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:53,520
I know.

804
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:58,520
I never expected it to be called that initials.

805
00:59:58,520 --> 00:59:59,520
Alright.

806
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,520
Ah, that's great. Alright.

807
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:05,520
Let's see. Of course, the last round is the routines.

808
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:09,520
Keep in mind that you can actually do a group routine if you wish to.

809
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,520
For two group pissing?

810
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:12,520
Knock it out!

811
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:16,520
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I'm sorry. That's the last. I swear that was the last. I'm sorry.

812
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:20,520
Oh my gosh.

813
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,520
Oh my gosh.

814
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,520
And James just pissed off all the...

815
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:29,520
I come in from the bathroom and you're still talking about piss?

816
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:32,020
What would you do without me to babysit you?

817
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:33,020
Don't be pissed off.

818
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:38,520
This show is so full of shit.

819
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:41,020
Not tonight, it's full of piss.

820
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:42,020
Full of pee.

821
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:45,520
You know what you should give as refreshment to everybody at the tournament?

822
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:46,520
Okay, okay, seriously?

823
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:47,520
No, no, no!

824
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:51,520
Red Bull and little plastic clear cups.

825
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,020
Because Red Bull looks like pee.

826
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:59,900
Okay, this seriously has to stop.

827
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:04,700
When I said that this show went to the toilet, I wasn't literal, you guys.

828
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:05,700
Jesus.

829
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:07,020
Well, you know.

830
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:10,340
And now our chat room is just going off.

831
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:12,340
Okay.

832
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:15,020
Breathe in.

833
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:16,020
Alright.

834
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:22,940
Alright, so, February 5th is when it all goes down.

835
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:30,940
It all goes down, by the way. There will be food supplied as well for those who enter the tournament.

836
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:32,940
And Red Bull.

837
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:37,940
Yes, everyone be sure to come out and pee A with us.

838
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:44,940
Alright, that was bad.

839
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:48,940
I think we need a break.

840
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:54,440
In this break, we're going to hear some music that was in some various Japanese DDR releases.

841
01:01:54,440 --> 01:02:00,240
Some of the newer ones. I just wanted an excuse to play Superstar and Paranoia Respect and some cool songs.

842
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:06,440
So we're going to hear that, and then we're going to come back, and we actually have some Bomani news I want to talk about when we come back.

843
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:11,440
Believe it or not, there's actually a new Bomani game being tested right now.

844
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,440
Is it the DDO with Mario?

845
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:17,940
No no no, we talked about that last week. There's no new details on DDR Mario yet, unless I miss something.

846
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:19,700
I'll check to see if there's any new details on that.

847
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:21,340
There's another new one that's being tested right now.

848
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:23,180
I'm gonna talk about that when we come back.

849
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:28,060
And we will, I'll do, oh, we should do it in the next break.

850
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:29,140
That's cool, okay.

851
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:33,660
We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

852
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:38,180
["Orange Lounge Radio"]

853
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:43,540
People always talk about

854
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:45,540
All the things they're all about

855
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:49,940
Slide it on a piece of paper

856
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:54,340
Got a feeling I'll see you later

857
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:57,940
There's something about these

858
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,940
That keep it moving

859
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:01,940
And if it's good enough

860
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:03,940
To get something cooking

861
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:05,940
That won't want to laugh at you

862
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:09,140
I'm stealing from connection

863
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:11,140
To the things you do

864
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:17,140
I don't know what it is that makes me feel like this

865
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:24,140
I don't know who you are, but you must be some kind of superstar

866
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:28,140
Cause you got a life in you no matter where you are

867
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:34,140
You just wanna be, I don't know what it is that makes me feel like this

868
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:41,260
I don't know who you are but you must be some kind of stupid star

869
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:46,620
Cause you got a lot for you, no matter where you are

870
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:53,160
I don't know what it is that you feel like saying

871
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:58,640
I don't know who you are but so you will see it some kind of stupid star

872
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:02,680
cause you got a lot for you, no matter where you are

873
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:07,680
The way you are, I'm in love with you

874
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:33,680
We don't care!

875
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:34,680
We don't care!

876
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:06,680
Oh

877
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:11,680
Orange Lounge Radio, we put your thing down for you.

878
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:42,460
it and reverse it.

879
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:47,220
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio recovering a little bit during that break here and we're

880
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:53,100
back and you know it's been kind of a slow week in the Bomani world, not a whole lot

881
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:59,580
of news but there was one pretty big thing that came up that I thought was pretty interesting

882
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:02,540
and it's actually something that kind of, I don't know, it's been leaking around on

883
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:06,300
various live journals out there and now you're seeing it kind of pop up on DDR

884
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:09,100
Freak as well I know somebody had posted about it over there in the forums over

885
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:14,860
there and it's actually a new game by Konami that's being tested right now and

886
01:08:14,860 --> 01:08:21,140
it's a game called dance 86.4 like I guess it's supposed to be some kind of

887
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:26,100
radio station parody or something you know yeah I think right John posted

888
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:30,260
something about it in her live journal and like she posted like a picture of

889
01:08:30,260 --> 01:08:35,820
of the actual machine and on the title she was like new she was like new of a

890
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:40,140
money game question mark and I saw it and I'm like dang that's pretty cool

891
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:45,020
except it was funny because one of her friends commented and said that the bars

892
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:49,660
were smaller well yeah this looks like a game that's obviously geared at kids I

893
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:52,780
just posted a link in the chat room if you guys hadn't hadn't seen this yet and

894
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:55,500
there's some pictures some full-length pictures you can bring up of what this

895
01:08:55,500 --> 01:09:01,620
game looks like, looks very kid-like, like you could say popin' music-like, but then

896
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:05,880
again, we all know popin' music was a game that was kind of aimed at kids originally

897
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:10,000
and has now quickly become like one of the tougher Bomani series, some would argue it's

898
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,600
the toughest Bomani series, but that's, you know, something you could be argued about.

899
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:20,760
It has a very similar look to DDR, except I noticed this. Three panels, that's it. You

900
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:26,240
got a left middle right which sort of reminds me of DDR solos three panel mode

901
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:29,160
if you remember that I don't know but DDR solo have like a three panel mode

902
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:33,600
that was very similar and you can see in these screenshots you can see a little

903
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:38,520
character there dancing looks very similar to the DDR concept it's a little

904
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:42,700
hard to tell without some moving screenshots but that's what we see right

905
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:47,520
now and then these little miniature bars that this time they're in the front as

906
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:52,200
as opposed to the back. So why you have the bars in the front

907
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:56,040
as opposed to the back, I have no idea, but that's the way it's built. So

908
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:59,400
take that as you will. Now here's the other interesting thing. When looking at

909
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,920
the song list, some of the early songs that are supposed to be in this,

910
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:05,680
you'll notice there's a couple songs that were actually in DDR Festival that

911
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:06,560
are showing up here.

912
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:10,320
One of them being the Cutie Honey theme that was in DDR Festival.

913
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:15,320
So some of those are crossing over into this new Dance

914
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:21,680
86.4 game which is very interesting I must say and yeah I'm being corrected in

915
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:27,400
the chat room that the three panel solo mode was actually bottom was involved so

916
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:30,240
you weren't just moving back and forth side to side like this one set up where

917
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:33,580
three arrows are all next to each other it was kind of like you could do upper

918
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:37,400
left or left and upper right or right and then bottom so you kind of had a

919
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:40,740
little bit different motion but this one is kind of like I don't know I would

920
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:44,000
think that the way you would dance to this would be more like a hoedown but

921
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Obviously this is something that's written, or being done for kids. I don't know. We'll see.

922
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Any comment on this game? The Dance 86.4 Funky Radio Station?

923
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:03,000
I have to... You know, I would think that they would have just done the Ohasta.

924
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:08,000
I know. Kind of weird, huh? Oh, you posted some more pictures there, didn't you, Loki?

925
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:15,640
Okay, very cool. What I think is kind of weird about this is that part of me is kind of scared

926
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:20,380
because, you know, you hear that, you know, we are starting over with DDR Extreme. Is

927
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:26,100
this starting over? This isn't even DDR. You're not even close. This is a spinoff of Bishi

928
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:30,240
Boshi. That's all it is. It's just like they have the Bishi Boshi type dancing game thing

929
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:35,560
that had three, it was exactly like this except it wasn't on stage. It was just on some stupid

930
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:41,000
little pad. They have it at AI. It's honestly, it's nothing new. It's nothing exciting. It's

931
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:46,160
just like a new bishy boshy game. They actually had, there was some other shit I posted too

932
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:55,520
in here that was kind of funny. There was, where did I put it here? Oh, this one right

933
01:11:55,520 --> 01:12:01,280
here. I'm all, looks like banjo freaks. And you know, it's some like banjo game thing.

934
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:05,280
They had, like, a bunch of stuff that was on this one website here that were look-

935
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:09,280
Well, keep in mind Namco came out with a whole bunch of music games they never saw.

936
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:13,280
Location testing. Um, like, yeah, they have the, um,

937
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:17,280
this, uh, karaoke game, I think, that's actually, um,

938
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:21,280
Idolmaster. It's another Namco music game that's coming out

939
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:25,280
where you have to become, like, a pop idol type thing. Um,

940
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:29,280
of course, you know, Guitar Freaks V. They had stuff about that, and, um,

941
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:39,280
Um, and then... Funky Radio Station Dance 86.4. But, um, yeah. I don't know. It's...

942
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:50,120
That looks interesting, I guess. So, I don't know. I can't help but feel a little bit of...

943
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:55,920
Come on, guys. You gotta work on this game. Where's my new DDR? Where is it? Where? I

944
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:59,920
I don't want this Dance 86.4 style. I want DDR.

945
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:03,920
Where's my DDR, Loki?

946
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:07,920
Uh, you just got Festival. I mean, shit. What do you want?

947
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:11,920
I want Arcade DDR! I can't believe they're making this whole new machine,

948
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:15,920
this Dance 86.4. Okay, and I understand maybe there's a market for kid games and stuff,

949
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:19,920
but, eh, it's frustrating.

950
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:23,920
Why are they spending time on this when they could be making me a beautiful new DDR machine?

951
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:37,280
cuz this is cheaper. Alright. Anyway, uh, let's move on. Loki, what's going on in the

952
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:44,920
sim scene right now? Anything? Yeah, finally, finally, the sim files have been released

953
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:52,560
for DDR UltraMix 2, Dancing Stage Fusion, and Festival. Finally, they're, well, done,

954
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:59,080
I guess. They would be found at, well, they have like a preliminary thing up right now.

955
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:04,320
It's pretty much, I mean, they're as done as far as you and I are concerned because,

956
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:10,400
I mean, oh no, they're missing the beginner steps on doubles. Whoo! Oh my God! You know,

957
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:20,400
But other than that, it's perfectly fine. They have them all done, including, I think, the first, no, not the first service pack, but everything else is done on it.

958
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:44,400
Now, I have a very long link I'll post later for where you can find these at, but check in DDRUK if you want to know. Keep up to date with their progress on Songpax 6 and 7, or whatever the two new ones are, because that's what's going to be happening there.

959
01:14:44,400 --> 01:15:02,400
DDR Maniacs is still down. Also, I think, I'm not sure if I mentioned it, because like I said, I can't remember where they came out on, but on DDR, or Bimani style, there's three more sim files for my songs on there, and they're actually pretty good, so you can go check those out, just, you know.

960
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:13,400
There was the Legend of TAC, the Gravity, Dark Sakura Burn Nation mix, and the Ecstasy

961
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:18,400
14 Hours Club mix, I believe.

962
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:21,400
No, that was an older one.

963
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:22,400
Anyways.

964
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:28,400
So yeah, that's pretty much all that's going on right now, scene wise.

965
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:36,400
So, that and Bomani is still talking about rolling out a site called Simulation Style, which I think is like Bomani Sims 2.0 type thing.

966
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:40,400
That's supposedly coming out later on, so...

967
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:43,400
That's it.

968
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:45,400
Alrighty.

969
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:47,400
Jamie, how you doing over there?

970
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:48,400
Sniffy.

971
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:51,400
Anything interesting going on on the forums over there?

972
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:54,400
There isn't crap happening on DDR Freak right now.

973
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:58,400
Someone PM'd me asking me what post touring is.

974
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:01,400
Could you explain for the masses what post touring is?

975
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:11,400
When you post a whole bunch of stuff, unnecessarily, especially for people who post three damn times in a row instead of editing your post.

976
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:16,400
I consider that to be a version of post touring.

977
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:17,400
Okay.

978
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:21,400
But now there's not really a whole major lot going on in the forums.

979
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:23,900
Yeah, so, you know, slow news week.

980
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:26,400
Slow news week. Slow everything.

981
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:30,900
Any people are just trying to get adjusted to the new year, maybe?

982
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:35,900
Maybe. I think everybody's kind of sitting on things until E3.

983
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:38,900
You know, so we're in for a slow couple of months.

984
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:42,900
I don't know, there is this stuff kind of brewing in Japan with DDR Mario

985
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:45,900
and supposedly being showed at that show that's going on right now.

986
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:47,900
I'm surprised we haven't heard anything about it.

987
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:49,900
I'm sure it'll leak out on the net in the next few days,

988
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:55,360
days, depending on what capacity this game is being shown in. And, you know, as far as

989
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:59,860
these new games getting test locations and stuff, we'll just kind of have to get the

990
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:03,600
news as we get it. Otherwise, as far as American releases go, we're probably not going to hear

991
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:06,920
anything until E3. That'll be the big time. Because, you know, if there is a new DDR game

992
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:11,680
coming out this year, which I'm confident there's going to be, we won't get the details

993
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:18,060
until E3. So, we're in for a very interesting next few months. All right. You guys ready

994
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:25,060
to have a cage match. Yes, please. Alright, here we go, Orange Lawns Radio cage match.

995
01:17:28,740 --> 01:17:34,220
The way the cage match works, we play three songs for your listening pleasure, and the

996
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:39,440
winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lawns Radio Live's Bimani Music

997
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:44,380
and More program, which plays 24 hours a day, seven days a week on the station when we're

998
01:17:44,380 --> 01:17:50,420
not here. The winning song, you get to hear a clip of it because it won last week so it

999
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:56,440
gets to be put in again this week. And then you hear two new songs in their entirety.

1000
01:17:56,440 --> 01:18:02,480
So let's start off with last week's song. Last week's song was a song that Jamie picked

1001
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:08,740
a couple weeks ago. It's two weeks in a row winning now and it's going for one more week.

1002
01:18:08,740 --> 01:18:14,140
The song is called Joe La Taxi, we're calling it for short. If you want to participate in

1003
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:20,060
cage match you got to be in our chat room www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on chat.

1004
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:27,060
Here it is, song number one, Oria Posey, Joe LaTaxi, the Jan Wayne remix radio cut. Enjoy.

1005
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:45,180
Having mics on would help.

1006
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:46,180
There it is.

1007
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:53,180
Another one tonight, a clip of Joe LaTaxi.

1008
01:20:53,180 --> 01:21:01,180
Alright, will Joe LaTaxi win again? We shall find out, but we have to put two new songs up against it, and the next song comes from Loki.

1009
01:21:01,180 --> 01:21:06,180
Loki, what are you putting in tonight? Is it a remix of Girls?

1010
01:21:06,180 --> 01:21:08,180
No.

1011
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:15,180
No, it's not a remix of Girls, because I haven't cut those down to size yet, so that's the only reason why you're not getting Girls.

1012
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:18,820
You pissed me off people and I will fucking put it in two more times cuz I have two more

1013
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:22,580
I will make a remix of that song if I have to in order to make another entry

1014
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:28,260
But this is not girls. This is this is our favorite friend Minnie head and his

1015
01:21:28,780 --> 01:21:34,380
Debut track that is gonna be on his next album that he demoed for the wonderful people on his website

1016
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:37,020
Unfortunately, you have to buy something or be a member or whatever

1017
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:39,660
So this is exclusive

1018
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:42,060
Not released yet. This is

1019
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:43,660
um...

1020
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:48,620
then what was it called? This is Take Me Away by Midihead.

1021
01:21:48,620 --> 01:21:51,700
Does he know that you're doing this?

1022
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:57,020
So, you're bootlegging... God, if we get a nasty letter, it's your ass. Alright, here it is.

1023
01:21:57,020 --> 01:21:58,020
I'm...

1024
01:21:58,020 --> 01:21:59,740
you know...

1025
01:21:59,740 --> 01:22:03,860
I'm creating buzz, okay? Buzz.

1026
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:07,700
Buzz is not bad. Buzz is good.

1027
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:11,880
Alright, let's see what kind of buzz this generates. Here it is, song number two, Midihead.

1028
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:18,880
take me away enjoy

1029
01:22:41,880 --> 01:23:00,880
A shot rings out of silence, another mother creeps

1030
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:14,880
And in this day of violence, they glorify the thieves

1031
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:17,880
Oh no, no, no

1032
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:23,880
I close my eyes in the darkness of the light

1033
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:34,880
I'm reaching for your hand Oh, give me away from here

1034
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:41,880
Away from all this madness Take me away from here

1035
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:45,880
Away from all the pain and fear

1036
01:23:45,880 --> 01:24:11,880
I'm crumpled in her corner

1037
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:18,880
Will this be her last breath?

1038
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:25,880
Some will mock, some will mourn her

1039
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:32,880
Has the cuddle hurt?

1040
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:40,880
I close my eyes and the darkness comes alive

1041
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:48,880
You're alive, you're reaching for my hand, hold me

1042
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:52,880
Won't you take me away from here

1043
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:55,880
Away from all this madness

1044
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:59,880
Take me away from here

1045
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:03,880
Away from all the pain and fear

1046
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:06,880
Away from here

1047
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:13,880
Away from all the sadness Take me away from here

1048
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:18,880
Away from all the pain and fear

1049
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:26,880
Far away

1050
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:30,880
But I don't know where you're from yet

1051
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:06,880
Won't you take me away from here, away from all this madness

1052
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:14,880
Take me away from here, away from all the pain and fear

1053
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:20,880
Away from here, away from all the sadness

1054
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:41,060
Let's go around and see what they thought.

1055
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:42,060
What we thought.

1056
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:43,060
Excuse me.

1057
01:26:43,060 --> 01:26:44,060
Jamie, your thoughts.

1058
01:26:44,060 --> 01:26:47,060
I still don't like that guy's voice.

1059
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:50,860
I'm not saying he's not talented or anything, I just don't really care for his voice.

1060
01:26:50,860 --> 01:26:56,860
But it did fit that song. I have to say, it did fit that song. So I give that one a 7.

1061
01:27:00,860 --> 01:27:07,860
Well I do have to agree with James about the voicing. I don't know, just something about it just doesn't blend too much to the music itself.

1062
01:27:07,860 --> 01:27:13,860
The artist is very talented, but I'll have to give it 10 out of 10.

1063
01:27:13,860 --> 01:27:15,860
7 from Xlicit

1064
01:27:15,860 --> 01:27:17,860
Arcadian

1065
01:27:17,860 --> 01:27:19,860
6 from Arcadian

1066
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:21,860
Loki

1067
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:23,860
He gets a 10 because I can't wait for his next album

1068
01:27:23,860 --> 01:27:25,860
And Angel

1069
01:27:25,860 --> 01:27:27,860
I really do like Monolithic stuff

1070
01:27:27,860 --> 01:27:29,860
And it was really kind of bouncy

1071
01:27:29,860 --> 01:27:31,860
8

1072
01:27:31,860 --> 01:27:33,860
Yeah I like Monolithic quite a bit too

1073
01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:35,860
I think he has a very distinct voice

1074
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:37,860
It's different

1075
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:39,860
It's not for everybody

1076
01:27:39,860 --> 01:27:41,860
But um

1077
01:27:41,860 --> 01:27:46,380
everybody but I don't know the only thing about that song for me is that I

1078
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:50,020
think he said this on his forums too which is why I kind of I kind of gave

1079
01:27:50,020 --> 01:27:53,140
Loki a funny look when he put this song in is that I don't think I think he said

1080
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:55,700
the song isn't quite finished yet that it's kind of still a work in progress

1081
01:27:55,700 --> 01:28:00,420
yes it is it's a demo yeah and that seat it's got that demo feel to me like it's

1082
01:28:00,420 --> 01:28:05,740
missing something there's something missing I can't put my finger on it but

1083
01:28:05,740 --> 01:28:09,700
I'm not the musician it's not I'm not gonna figure out exactly what it is but

1084
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:14,100
I like it. I like what I hear so far. I definitely will pick up his next album when it comes

1085
01:28:14,100 --> 01:28:19,420
out. If for no other reason than I just think he's a cool guy. So, uh, I give it an 8.

1086
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:26,100
Alright, so an 8 for me. And moving on, it's my turn to pick a song and I really didn't

1087
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:30,140
want to do this tonight. I did not want to put this song in, surprisingly enough, I didn't

1088
01:28:30,140 --> 01:28:36,980
want to do this, but I feel like I have been listening to nothing but this song non-stop

1089
01:28:36,980 --> 01:28:42,440
this week that I would be doing myself a personal injustice to not put this song

1090
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:49,200
in the cage match tonight and no it's not girls sorry but the song I did put

1091
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:54,560
in is another orange lounge favorite artist it is echo image because I picked

1092
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:57,680
up a new single but it's a new echo image song I picked up a single by them

1093
01:28:57,680 --> 01:29:03,160
last week it rocks I love it the song called endless day I hope you guys enjoy

1094
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:06,160
Here it is, song number three, Echo Image, Endless Day.

1095
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:21,160
Put me back inside so we can try Cross an ocean of a mountain, say goodbye

1096
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:29,160
Reverse what I once said, I can't be wrong

1097
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:38,160
Yes, I have my reasons after all

1098
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:45,160
Can't find the way to go, we're going back in time

1099
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:53,160
Didn't tell you what we ever thought we'd find

1100
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:59,160
Made you think you could find another way

1101
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:08,160
And you left behind another day

1102
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:13,160
I'll be gone

1103
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:29,160
I'll be gone

1104
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:54,160
Depending on those words I once belonged They used to make much sense but I was wrong

1105
01:31:54,160 --> 01:32:01,160
You're freezing my events all yesterday

1106
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:09,160
Yes, I should see you running my own way

1107
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:14,160
Get back, get back, get back, get back to living

1108
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:19,160
We're going back in time

1109
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:26,160
If you get lucky, you're as fucked up as fun

1110
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:33,160
Make a mistake and start a fight from the other way

1111
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:41,160
If you get left behind, it's another day

1112
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:47,160
Can't find it, but we're going back inside

1113
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:56,160
Can't tell you what we are about to find

1114
01:32:56,160 --> 01:33:02,160
Make them think that we're fighting another way

1115
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:11,420
Alright though, song number three, Echo Image with Endless Day. Let's find out the scores.

1116
01:34:11,420 --> 01:34:12,420
Jamie?

1117
01:34:12,420 --> 01:34:18,180
I actually really like that, because I think his voice is just slightly over for that one,

1118
01:34:18,180 --> 01:34:23,060
like it's a little too loud, because on the other ones I've heard he has a really nice

1119
01:34:23,060 --> 01:34:31,140
blend with the music, almost in Ben Halen's, you know, Sammy Hagar era type blending. This

1120
01:34:31,140 --> 01:34:33,140
and I think it was a little overpowering, so I give it a 9.

1121
01:34:33,140 --> 01:34:35,140
Alright, 9 from Jamie, explicit.

1122
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:48,140
I actually like the song, I give it like a 8.5, but there's something about it that just makes it far from perfect in a way.

1123
01:34:48,140 --> 01:34:54,140
It's a very great song, it has a lot of originality and variation, it's very good music.

1124
01:34:54,140 --> 01:34:59,660
Instead of like all ticket cutter, which, I don't know, just the pauses is like, anything

1125
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:03,960
the pauses is what kills the good, because of the song.

1126
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:04,960
Not a big fan of pauses.

1127
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:09,960
Well, I like some of the pauses, but it looks like it's done wrong in a way, I'm not sure.

1128
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:11,960
I just don't feel like it's something appealing.

1129
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:12,960
Alright.

1130
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:14,460
Other than that, it's a very good song.

1131
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:15,460
Alright.

1132
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:16,460
I like it a lot.

1133
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:17,460
Fair enough.

1134
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:18,460
Arcadian.

1135
01:35:18,460 --> 01:35:19,460
That's good.

1136
01:35:19,460 --> 01:35:20,460
I'll give it an 8.

1137
01:35:20,460 --> 01:35:21,460
Loki.

1138
01:35:21,460 --> 01:35:22,460
I guess it's him because it's awesome.

1139
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:27,460
10 because it's Echo Image and it's still awesome.

1140
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:55,580
here after this quick recap of the three songs you can vote for tonight.

1141
01:35:55,580 --> 01:36:09,460
Song number one, Jonah Taxi.

1142
01:36:09,460 --> 01:36:22,500
Song number two, Midihead, Take Me Away.

1143
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:25,820
I'm picking really bad clips of the songs tonight, I'm sorry guys.

1144
01:36:25,820 --> 01:36:32,300
Song number three, Echo Image, Endless Day.

1145
01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:45,860
All right. Place vote now. Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your

1146
01:36:45,860 --> 01:36:51,320
vote for song number one, two, or three. You can call them Joe LaTaxi, Take Me Away, Endless

1147
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:58,540
Day, Echo Image, Midi Head, and if you can pronounce the other one, that's fine by me

1148
01:36:58,540 --> 01:37:19,540
Whatever we'll get the message across. Alright, moving on. More stuff going on. So when it is a slow news week, I like to go around and I like to browse some of the forums and I like to be inspired by certain topics that are going on in some of the various web forums. Of course, one of the largest being DDRFreak and of course we like DDRFreak because not only do we have a host who happens to be a moderator there.

1149
01:37:19,540 --> 01:37:21,540
I wonder who that is.

1150
01:37:21,540 --> 01:37:22,540
I think it's you.

1151
01:37:22,540 --> 01:37:24,540
Oh, I forgot.

1152
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:27,680
Our webmaster is a moderator there

1153
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:32,040
and then several of our frequent guests are moderators there.

1154
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:35,660
One's an admin. And yeah, there you go. And then we get rerun.

1155
01:37:35,660 --> 01:37:41,100
E-admin. And now we are a small part of DDR Freak. We have to bring the site down

1156
01:37:41,100 --> 01:37:44,140
with our dumb little show we do.

1157
01:37:44,140 --> 01:37:48,500
Which you can hear Friday nights at six o'clock over on DDR Freak Radio,

1158
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:52,660
which is a cool station. Check it out. But they got forums over there and you know

1159
01:37:52,660 --> 01:37:55,880
sometimes I just I love these topics that come up

1160
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:59,640
and over a DDR chit chat I just I had to bring this up

1161
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:04,160
here's the topic title it's called don't you wish you had a girlfriend that

1162
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:05,320
played DDR

1163
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:12,080
let me sum up the message here this is like every guy I knows dream

1164
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:16,440
to have a girl that will play DDR and actually be good

1165
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:19,920
I mean come on wouldn't that just be awesome

1166
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:22,920
I mean, except for the part where she steals all the glory or whatnot.

1167
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:28,920
Wouldn't that be cool to have a girlfriend that plays DDR? Loki.

1168
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:29,920
There goes another F you.

1169
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:30,920
Or another kid.

1170
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:33,920
Wouldn't it be awesome to actually touch a real girl?

1171
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:39,920
Wouldn't it be awesome to get laid?

1172
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:43,920
Wouldn't it be awesome to rape a woman instead of a freakin' bar?

1173
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:45,920
No.

1174
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:46,920
No?

1175
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:50,920
Not at all.

1176
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:53,920
God, this is sad.

1177
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:56,920
Someday I'll get laid!

1178
01:38:56,920 --> 01:39:01,920
Jamie, don't you wish you had a girlfriend that played DDR?

1179
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:06,920
Well, I don't know. I have to ask my fiance.

1180
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:10,920
Jamie, surely you must have some kind of comment on this, because

1181
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:13,920
let me look here. Let me read that. Let me find that quote again.

1182
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:18,400
to have a girl that will play DDR and actually be good!

1183
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:22,560
I wouldn't know anything about that.

1184
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:28,240
So are you saying that there's no girls that are actually good at DDR out there?

1185
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:31,320
Well of course we are, I mean...

1186
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:35,280
Even though you can pass katas and...

1187
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:40,360
You know what, my comment is completely off the record as we are

1188
01:39:40,360 --> 01:39:43,080
probably being recorded by a few people.

1189
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:48,080
But that's probably the most dumb threat I've ever freaking heard of in my life.

1190
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:52,080
That's almost as dumb as show off your cell phone.

1191
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:55,080
Which is going on a random chat right now.

1192
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:58,080
This has turned out to be a dumbass, dumbass revolution.

1193
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:04,080
Well, hey, you know, the guy just wants a girlfriend that I can sort of see.

1194
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:08,080
Don't we want to date people that have similar interests? Sometimes.

1195
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:14,080
But then you got people like DJ Nes saying, ooh, is there any hot girls in NorCal? Or shit like this.

1196
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:23,080
No. You know what? There are no girls in NorCal, actually. We should tell them that. There's actually no girls here. It's one big gay bar, actually.

1197
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:26,080
I'm not responding to this.

1198
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:33,080
You know, why would they even ask? Is there any hotties in NorCal? Like, they're gonna talk to you. Sure.

1199
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:35,080
Seriously.

1200
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:39,440
Okay, if you gotta ask, they're not gonna talk.

1201
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:40,880
I mean, really, really.

1202
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:42,800
Oh! Someone's looking for Hotties!

1203
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:44,240
Maybe I'll go date him!

1204
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:45,680
I mean, really.

1205
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:50,960
Cause I really go to an arcade to pick up dates. I drive a ricer! I am pimp!

1206
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:54,840
Date me!

1207
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:58,400
Allow me to spread my seed in jeans!

1208
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:00,880
So that we can create the ultimate

1209
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:02,420
dancing person

1210
01:41:02,420 --> 01:41:16,100
who yes, will not get laid. Anyways, you know, actually I did, I actually went in the thread

1211
01:41:16,100 --> 01:41:23,420
and I responded. I actually responded and here was my response down here. Nah, I don't

1212
01:41:23,420 --> 01:41:26,960
really want a girlfriend that plays DDR. I think it would be cool to have a boyfriend

1213
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:33,960
that plays DDR though. That was my response. Angel, any feedback?

1214
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:43,800
Well, considering I'm going to have to switch this around, at one point I did want to find

1215
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:48,240
a guy that played DDR, but that's kind of, I suppose it's kind of easy because it's all

1216
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:59,280
guys but hey it can happen so you know miraculously yay okay so whatever you

1217
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:09,920
know oh gee yeah whatever all right so I don't know you know I'm trying to give

1218
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:14,280
this guy a little credit here okay he's probably young and you know um I mean

1219
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:17,500
But we see these threads all over the freaking forums.

1220
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:18,200
I know, I know.

1221
01:42:18,200 --> 01:42:20,280
But let me give you guys some advice, OK?

1222
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:23,540
People assume that they want to date somebody that has similar interests

1223
01:42:23,540 --> 01:42:26,020
with them so that they can go out and do stuff together.

1224
01:42:26,020 --> 01:42:26,780
That's cool.

1225
01:42:26,780 --> 01:42:31,100
But remember, guys, your interests don't always have to match up 100%

1226
01:42:31,100 --> 01:42:32,260
for a successful relationship.

1227
01:42:32,260 --> 01:42:37,460
In fact, I've been in relationships where we weren't alike at all, OK?

1228
01:42:37,460 --> 01:42:40,100
We were not even into the same types of things.

1229
01:42:40,100 --> 01:42:43,820
But part of the relationship was learning about each other's interests.

1230
01:42:43,820 --> 01:42:49,580
And I think as long as your potential partner is open to the idea of, you know, hey, you

1231
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:55,020
play a dancing video game, you know, as long as maybe your potential partner watches a

1232
01:42:55,020 --> 01:42:58,020
soap opera that you think is stupid, but they watch it every day.

1233
01:42:58,020 --> 01:43:00,980
Well, you've got to be kind of open to that and kind of see it from their perspective.

1234
01:43:00,980 --> 01:43:04,740
Part about relationship is kind of learning from each other, I think.

1235
01:43:04,740 --> 01:43:07,500
You're never going to find anybody that's 100% just like you.

1236
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:10,820
I know we all want to fuck ourselves, but let's face it.

1237
01:43:10,820 --> 01:43:14,020
I don't know about that guy, that's... that's sick.

1238
01:43:14,020 --> 01:43:15,220
Okay, I'm kidding.

1239
01:43:15,220 --> 01:43:21,920
But yeah, I mean, opposites attract, and that's all I have to say.

1240
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:24,020
Wouldn't you guys agree with me, though? The relate part of...

1241
01:43:24,020 --> 01:43:25,620
I totally agree, I mean...

1242
01:43:25,620 --> 01:43:26,820
Yeah, no problem. Like, really.

1243
01:43:26,820 --> 01:43:33,020
Opposites attract, you can settle your differences and make sure you understand each other in a way.

1244
01:43:33,020 --> 01:43:37,520
I see no problem with all these differences. The main thing is communication, though. We all know that.

1245
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:39,640
That reminds me of that old Paula Abdul song,

1246
01:43:39,640 --> 01:43:43,120
Two Steps Forward, Two Steps Back.

1247
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:47,780
I don't remember that. And I have no career and I'm on a stupid show

1248
01:43:47,780 --> 01:43:49,360
that uh...

1249
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:51,680
makes fun of people that suck.

1250
01:43:51,680 --> 01:43:54,320
She begged! She begged!

1251
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:56,940
God, Paula Abdul so...

1252
01:43:56,940 --> 01:44:03,940
last century.

1253
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:06,600
Yeah, anyways.

1254
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:09,800
That's lame. Why do people start threads like that, really?

1255
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:12,080
Go talk to real people.

1256
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:16,160
Stop using forums.

1257
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:21,560
Why don't you stop wondering about girls and go discover what girls really are?

1258
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:25,320
What if we didn't have that luxury of living in a somewhat big town and being

1259
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:29,140
able to go to the arcade and find people like us? Because we all met, you know,

1260
01:44:29,140 --> 01:44:32,080
like it or not, we all met playing DDR, right?

1261
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:39,080
So, you know, maybe we've got a luxury this guy doesn't have. Comment?

1262
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:41,080
We're special.

1263
01:44:41,080 --> 01:44:42,080
I told you you were special.

1264
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:52,080
We're talented. And on top of that, you want to know, I actually met Dan online through anime and video games.

1265
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:55,080
So you can find love on a forum?

1266
01:44:55,080 --> 01:45:01,080
No. I didn't know what the fuck a forum was when I first went online. It was just someone my roommates knew.

1267
01:45:01,080 --> 01:45:26,080
I'll tell you how I found everything. It's basically like this. I was bored, so I read the manual for, like, DDR USA or whatever, and in the back it gave special credits to ddrfreak.com. Then in turn I went to ddrfreak.com, found that, found the regional forums, found the link to the Sacramento's webpage, joined their forums, found a meetup, and then went there. That's basically the whole chain of events.

1268
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:31,560
So, if I'm hearing this right, you're suggesting maybe what this guy ought to do is if he wants

1269
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:35,740
to find the girl that's in the DDR, go to a meetup in your area where there are going

1270
01:45:35,740 --> 01:45:40,680
to be people playing DDR, boys and girls, and there's going to be 20 smelly guys all

1271
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:42,040
fighting over that one girl.

1272
01:45:42,040 --> 01:45:47,440
Yeah, I mean, go Friday nights, Saturday nights, or even into a tournament.

1273
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:49,600
Exactly, go to your local tournament.

1274
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:53,240
If someone dares to even organize one.

1275
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:57,240
So, it's hard to say because I don't know where this guy lives, but...

1276
01:45:57,240 --> 01:46:01,240
Alright, anyway, we're going to go to...

1277
01:46:01,240 --> 01:46:06,240
I was going to say we're going to go to a break, but I think we're going to go to find out who won tonight's cage match!

1278
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:09,240
Who do you guys think won tonight's cage match?

1279
01:46:09,240 --> 01:46:13,240
I think that Taku won with Holic.

1280
01:46:13,240 --> 01:46:18,240
Taku did get another few votes tonight for Holic, but unfortunately we throw those out and shred them.

1281
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:20,240
Eventually he's going to win!

1282
01:46:20,240 --> 01:46:23,240
Eventually. Actually, I think he would have won one of the ones a few weeks ago.

1283
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:26,240
What do you guys think won? Any guesses?

1284
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:31,240
I'm guessing... Echo Image, maybe?

1285
01:46:31,240 --> 01:46:37,240
Yeah, I was gonna guess Echo Image, even though Midi Head's pretty cool, but yeah.

1286
01:46:37,240 --> 01:46:40,240
And then Jamie's pick is also cool, so...

1287
01:46:40,240 --> 01:46:43,240
Uh, yeah, I'm still gonna guess Echo Image.

1288
01:46:43,240 --> 01:46:46,240
All right, let's find out.

1289
01:46:47,240 --> 01:46:49,240
Uh, what, Logie?

1290
01:46:49,240 --> 01:46:55,240
I was just quoting them all. Imagine how it would be to be at the top, making cash money,

1291
01:46:55,240 --> 01:47:01,240
detouring all around the world, telling stories about young girls.

1292
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:08,240
Right. All right. Here it is, tonight's winner, the Orange Lawns Radio Cage Match, by one vote.

1293
01:47:08,240 --> 01:47:15,240
Only one vote made this song. Wait, it's always one vote. Here it is by one vote.

1294
01:47:15,240 --> 01:47:24,240
There is a new champion, Echo Image with Endless Day, one vote over Jola Taxi.

1295
01:47:24,240 --> 01:47:27,440
That's why you dirty French people!

1296
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:28,440
One vote.

1297
01:47:28,440 --> 01:47:29,440
Why am I not surprised?

1298
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:30,440
Very close vote, very close vote.

1299
01:47:30,440 --> 01:47:34,720
And Midyhead picked up quite a few votes of his own too, but one vote over Jola Taxi.

1300
01:47:34,720 --> 01:47:37,040
So if you think your vote doesn't make a difference, ooh hoo.

1301
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:39,040
I already know what I'm going to pick.

1302
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:40,040
Girl.

1303
01:47:40,040 --> 01:47:41,040
The chat room knows what I'm going to pick too.

1304
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:43,040
I know what I'm going to pick.

1305
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:44,040
Well good.

1306
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:45,040
Uh oh.

1307
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:56,040
Echo Image can win again. Alright, we'll see next week. We'll let Echo Image win again, but in the meantime, you get that one in rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio.

1308
01:47:56,040 --> 01:48:05,040
Let's go to a break, shall we? In this break, some DDR potpourri. I think we'll do songs that were in DDR and 2DX. That sounds like fun.

1309
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:11,000
fun. We'll start it off with a song that Jamie requested we play, Blue Impulse.

1310
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Happy.

1311
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
Or as some folks call it...

1312
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,000
Alishoto.

1313
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Enjoy. We'll be back.

1314
01:52:45,000 --> 01:53:11,000
Every night, I hear your voice Baby, every day, and every night

1315
01:54:45,000 --> 01:55:10,000
Orange Lounge Radio, we put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

1316
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:18,880
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening as we are usually

1317
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:23,000
here every Sunday night from 6.30pm to 9.30pm Pacific Standard Time.

1318
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,960
I was being such camera horror during the break too, did you see that?

1319
01:55:25,960 --> 01:55:28,600
I might get on the cam.

1320
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:29,600
Shock of shocks!

1321
01:55:29,600 --> 01:55:30,600
That would be amazing.

1322
01:55:30,600 --> 01:55:31,600
You definitely want to stay tuned for that.

1323
01:55:31,600 --> 01:55:35,240
But actually I just made this really random pose on the cam and it actually turned out

1324
01:55:35,240 --> 01:55:36,240
really good.

1325
01:55:36,240 --> 01:55:38,240
You definitely need to make an icon of that.

1326
01:55:38,240 --> 01:55:39,240
I'm going to.

1327
01:55:39,240 --> 01:55:45,240
Alright, we shall see. And then the chat room's being so sweet, they're talking about how they want to meet us and stuff.

1328
01:55:45,240 --> 01:55:52,240
We do want to go to a con. I, come hell or high water, I'm going to make it to Faname this year.

1329
01:55:52,240 --> 01:55:55,240
I wanted to go to Faname, but I want to cosplay this year.

1330
01:55:55,240 --> 01:55:57,240
So, you know, that would be a good way to...

1331
01:55:57,240 --> 01:56:00,240
I'm thinking about making an idea I had a while back.

1332
01:56:00,240 --> 01:56:03,240
We should write to Faname people and get one of those lecture things.

1333
01:56:03,240 --> 01:56:04,240
I want to make a white mage outfit.

1334
01:56:04,240 --> 01:56:07,240
That would be awesome. That would be cool.

1335
01:56:07,240 --> 01:56:11,240
I'll go as a- I'll go as a warrior. I'll go as a warrior in Sublegar.

1336
01:56:11,240 --> 01:56:13,240
I wanted to do the Yuna 10-2 vintage outfit.

1337
01:56:13,240 --> 01:56:15,240
Oh no, that's cool.

1338
01:56:15,240 --> 01:56:17,240
That one was really neat. Those boots.

1339
01:56:17,240 --> 01:56:21,240
I definitely want to do the warrior in Sublegar though.

1340
01:56:24,240 --> 01:56:26,240
But, huh? When is what?

1341
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:30,240
Uh, Faname is usually- Loki, isn't Faname usually around Memorial Day weekend?

1342
01:56:30,240 --> 01:56:35,960
day weekend? Yeah, it was actually on Memorial Day weekend last year. That's right, I remember

1343
01:56:35,960 --> 01:56:39,040
Fanta Mae was only like a week after E3 last year. Let me get the Fanta Mae dates, I'll

1344
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:41,680
go check. We'll have to talk to the Fanta Mae people though. Do you think we're good

1345
01:56:41,680 --> 01:56:47,600
enough to get our own little lecture thing? We are hot, okay? We're hot shit! Okay, honestly,

1346
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:53,960
honestly, they had Tampopo arcade there. Do you remember what Tampopo arcade was? Okay.

1347
01:56:53,960 --> 01:56:57,880
Question answered, thanks. Alright, Angel. I'll go if somebody wants to kidnap me for

1348
01:56:57,880 --> 01:57:00,920
for a weekend. That sounded really bad, oops.

1349
01:57:00,920 --> 01:57:05,480
Fonomay is May 27th, 28th, 29th, and 30th.

1350
01:57:05,480 --> 01:57:09,420
Now, now, I know, okay, everybody in the chat room is going,

1351
01:57:09,420 --> 01:57:14,780
why Fonomay? Come to our local convention on the East Coast. Because Fonomay Expo sucks!

1352
01:57:14,780 --> 01:57:19,320
It's not Fonomay Expo, yeah, it's the fact that Fonomay we can drive to,

1353
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:24,240
okay, we can all pile in the OLR van that doesn't exist, except in my imagination.

1354
01:57:24,240 --> 01:57:27,400
We can pile in the Mystery Machine, which is the OLR van,

1355
01:57:27,400 --> 01:57:34,900
and go. Uh, whereas to go to the East Coast costs money that we don't have until we become

1356
01:57:34,900 --> 01:57:38,480
rich and famous. So, we'll see. That's what you can do.

1357
01:57:38,480 --> 01:57:42,760
E3 is the weekend before. If you want to see us at your East Coast Con,

1358
01:57:42,760 --> 01:57:47,840
help us be rich and famous. That's what it is. Send us money.

1359
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:51,880
E3 is the weekend before. Alright, we'll see. We would love to come

1360
01:57:51,880 --> 01:57:55,720
to more conventions, honestly. We will whore ourselves out to anybody that wants to have

1361
01:57:55,720 --> 01:58:01,600
us, so... We could try Pacific Coast Con. We'll even fly Southwest. I mean, we're not

1362
01:58:01,600 --> 01:58:07,000
picky. We'll fly Southwest and stay in a Motel 6. There's the one that the people who originally

1363
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:12,940
started AX do now, things like Pacific Coast Con or something. That basically is back to

1364
01:58:12,940 --> 01:58:18,820
what AX originally was before it got stupid. And I hear it's a pretty good con. We could

1365
01:58:18,820 --> 01:58:26,740
to do YowieCon! Hot! Oh my god, we should do YowieCon and go all like, like J-Rock style.

1366
01:58:26,740 --> 01:58:31,620
You just made me blink and run away, but maybe that's a good thing. YowieCon's supposed to

1367
01:58:31,620 --> 01:58:40,380
be fun. Loki, wouldn't you want to do YowieCon? Oh yeah, look at me all excited. Alright,

1368
01:58:40,380 --> 01:58:43,780
I think what we'll do now is actually we're going to open up our Skype line for some feedback.

1369
01:58:43,780 --> 01:58:46,940
If you guys want to call our show, we're going to do that. So we're going to open up the

1370
01:58:46,940 --> 01:58:50,240
skype line right now for you guys to be able to call into our show and have a

1371
01:58:50,240 --> 01:58:54,020
chat with us. Um, Jamie in the meantime I know you wanted to talk about something

1372
01:58:54,020 --> 01:58:56,760
that's going on. We were talking about LiveJournal a little bit before and I

1373
01:58:56,760 --> 01:58:59,420
know you've got a new little project going on over there so go ahead and plug

1374
01:58:59,420 --> 01:59:06,800
away. Over on LiveJournal I've made a community called GeekFit, G-E-E-K-S-I-T, for

1375
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:12,560
anybody who was wanting to have feedback on getting in better shape and you know

1376
01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:15,800
there's a few of us on there right now basically just like a big support group

1377
01:59:15,800 --> 01:59:21,280
for each other you know sharing tips you know asking about exercise different

1378
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:25,360
things that are helping all of us so if you're interested in bettering yourself

1379
01:59:25,360 --> 01:59:33,240
then join up it's what we're for. Sounds cool so now we didn't you have to have

1380
01:59:33,240 --> 01:59:37,040
another community at one point that was kind of similar to food? It was it was

1381
01:59:37,040 --> 01:59:42,200
actually just for certain local oh okay oh I'm sorry I'm sorry that was oh yeah

1382
01:59:42,200 --> 01:59:44,200
Yeah, that was an invite only one anyway, right?

1383
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:45,200
Yeah, it was invite only.

1384
01:59:45,200 --> 01:59:46,200
Okay.

1385
01:59:46,200 --> 01:59:47,200
I was special because I was there.

1386
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:51,280
This one is open, but the requirement is that you have to be a geek.

1387
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:55,320
And if you're listening to this show, that's an instant qualifier, honestly, because you

1388
01:59:55,320 --> 01:59:56,960
have to be a geek to listen to this show.

1389
01:59:56,960 --> 02:00:03,000
So you are pre-approved for membership in a Geek Fit if you're listening to this show.

1390
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:08,560
So check that out, and I know a lot of folks out there use DDR as a means for exercise.

1391
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:11,440
I'm putting a link in the chatroom momentarily.

1392
02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:15,000
Now there's, there's more to, though, you wouldn't, you know, somebody wants to join

1393
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:18,000
this community and talk about how DDR is their exercise program.

1394
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:19,280
That's cool and all.

1395
02:00:19,280 --> 02:00:22,320
But what are some other alternatives that you guys would be encouraging over in the

1396
02:00:22,320 --> 02:00:24,320
Geek Fit community?

1397
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:29,720
Well, it's more or less just leaning more toward healthy attitudes.

1398
02:00:29,720 --> 02:00:35,400
You know, we would encourage, like if you say, okay, if I need to play how much DDR

1399
02:00:35,400 --> 02:00:40,960
to lose how much, then, you know, we've been sharing in there, like, like our last thing

1400
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:47,280
that we put in there was different snacks, and it's about at least three people on the

1401
02:00:47,280 --> 02:00:49,760
community now are doing low-carb diets.

1402
02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:54,600
We have other people who are highly active, and then, you know, there's my high-protein

1403
02:00:54,600 --> 02:01:01,800
thing that I'm doing, but mostly we just support each other's style of how we're doing it and

1404
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:02,800
give feedback.

1405
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:03,800
All right.

1406
02:01:03,800 --> 02:01:05,560
I'm going to follow up with you in a minute here.

1407
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:09,260
I actually just picked up a call on the Skype line here because I want to actually pick

1408
02:01:09,260 --> 02:01:12,260
up a call while we've got somebody on the line. Hi, you're on Orange House Radio. Who

1409
02:01:12,260 --> 02:01:19,260
dis? Hello? Hello. This is Jaded. Hi, Jaded. How are you? I'm doing fine. Is this off?

1410
02:01:19,260 --> 02:01:23,300
Good. Now, this is the first time you've called into the show, isn't it? Yes, it is. Fresh

1411
02:01:23,300 --> 02:01:31,300
blood. Any comment you wanted to make about tonight's show? Any comment in general? Yes,

1412
02:01:31,300 --> 02:01:39,240
actually, we were tight. I just lost you there, bud. You might have some bandwidth going there,

1413
02:01:39,240 --> 02:01:44,240
I got bandwidth issues. You might want to stop anything else you're doing, even if you're listening to the show.

1414
02:01:44,240 --> 02:01:47,240
Can you hear me?

1415
02:01:47,240 --> 02:01:49,240
I think we might have lost him. Can you hear me, guy?

1416
02:01:49,240 --> 02:01:50,240
Pardon me?

1417
02:01:50,240 --> 02:01:55,240
Okay, there you are. Your bandwidth, you're really choppy right now. You got a comment for us?

1418
02:01:55,240 --> 02:01:59,240
Oh, really? Because my bandwidth is not being used all the time.

1419
02:01:59,240 --> 02:02:02,240
Ooh, just must be a shoddy connection. I don't know.

1420
02:02:02,240 --> 02:02:06,240
Okay, try it now. I had...

1421
02:02:06,240 --> 02:02:07,240
A little better.

1422
02:02:07,240 --> 02:02:10,240
I have something about it that I was noticing it, to tell you the truth.

1423
02:02:11,240 --> 02:02:14,240
What was the comment you wanted to make? We'll try to pick it up as best we can.

1424
02:02:15,240 --> 02:02:20,240
Okay, the comment I wanted to make was about meeting the ORL crew, actually.

1425
02:02:21,240 --> 02:02:24,240
Okay, meeting the Orange Mountains Radio crew, yes, and we can hear you good now. So, yeah, what was the comment?

1426
02:02:25,240 --> 02:02:30,240
The comment was, that would be like a great random prize, so to speak.

1427
02:02:30,240 --> 02:02:34,280
a great random prize. For us to give out, you mean?

1428
02:02:34,280 --> 02:02:38,120
To fly somebody out here? Yeah, basically.

1429
02:02:38,120 --> 02:02:42,080
Kind of more or less as like a game show, so to speak.

1430
02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:45,520
Kind of like The Price is Right. So, okay,

1431
02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:48,800
he's breaking up a little bit, but as I understand what he's suggesting here is

1432
02:02:48,800 --> 02:02:51,680
that we should do some type of game show, and the big prize would be

1433
02:02:51,680 --> 02:02:57,400
fly out here and meet the OLR crew. I don't know about that. I mean, my god,

1434
02:02:57,400 --> 02:02:59,120
that means one of us would have to put this

1435
02:02:59,120 --> 02:03:02,600
person up in everything be a little weird but

1436
02:03:02,600 --> 02:03:06,560
I like the idea it just involves money

1437
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:10,680
which is non-existent in our budget. How much was in the budget this year

1438
02:03:10,680 --> 02:03:14,000
Dark Sakura? How much did we have in the Orange Ontario budget?

1439
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:17,520
Some sun-dried tomatoes. Yeah I believe we had some sun-dried tomatoes and about five

1440
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:19,360
Jelly Bellies in this year's budget.

1441
02:03:19,360 --> 02:03:22,880
I contributed cashews though. You did so that was good so

1442
02:03:22,880 --> 02:03:26,560
hopefully we can sell that stuff on eBay and we'd be able to

1443
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:30,320
have this contest I like the idea I just don't know if we can do it

1444
02:03:30,320 --> 02:03:34,480
I would you enter if we did it? Yeah I would. Now you're not one of those freaky

1445
02:03:34,480 --> 02:03:37,440
stalkers that have like an axe that would chop us up or anything are you?

1446
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:40,860
Oh no. Okay alright sounds good

1447
02:03:40,860 --> 02:03:44,000
alright any other comment you want to make? And then

1448
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:48,160
no that's the only comment I really wanted to make. Alright well I like the idea

1449
02:03:48,160 --> 02:03:50,880
jaded I hope one day we're rich and we can make it work for you guys

1450
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:54,560
okay alright have a good one buddy yep alright bye

1451
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:58,560
We like new people calling in. All right, if you want to call in, Skype line's open. Give us a call there.

1452
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:03,560
Jamie actually is over on the cam right now. Gasp, shock, and awe.

1453
02:04:03,560 --> 02:04:08,560
www.orangelaungeradio.com if you want to head over there and look.

1454
02:04:08,560 --> 02:04:19,560
You know, actually, this is what would be a good idea, is that instead of flying somebody out here necessarily to, like, hang out in our studio house and everything like that,

1455
02:04:19,560 --> 02:04:27,560
Maybe if we were to do the Fatime thing, or the E3 thing, we could actually have a come with us to E3 contest. How cool would that be?

1456
02:04:27,560 --> 02:04:34,560
People would be murdering each other to do that, so I don't know. We'll see. One day, one day we'll make one of these ideas work.

1457
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:39,560
Anyway, we got another call on the Orange Launch Radio skype line, so let's have a chat. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1458
02:04:39,560 --> 02:04:43,560
Hello Sky, it's Siggy here. Hello Siggy, what's on your mind, buddy?

1459
02:04:43,560 --> 02:04:48,060
Well, I just recently browsed into the Bimani style forms.

1460
02:04:48,060 --> 02:04:50,800
Actually, this was as of last Thursday.

1461
02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:55,960
RMZ posted about what he knows about 9th Style CS so far.

1462
02:04:55,960 --> 02:04:59,000
Ooh, I want to hear! 9th Style, very sexy, what's up?

1463
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Yeah, there are going to be 60 9th Style songs, I mean 60 songs from 9th Style.

1464
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:05,280
Uh-huh, that's hot.

1465
02:05:05,280 --> 02:05:13,160
Yeah, and there are going to be three songs that are most likely going to be on 9th Style CS,

1466
02:05:13,160 --> 02:05:17,880
which are going to be, that have anothers, which is Genim Screams, Checking You Out,

1467
02:05:17,880 --> 02:05:18,880
and Minimalion.

1468
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:21,600
Okay, so there are new songs that haven't had anothers before?

1469
02:05:21,600 --> 02:05:26,400
They didn't have any anothers, but these are the three songs that will most likely come

1470
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:27,400
back.

1471
02:05:27,400 --> 02:05:28,400
Gotcha.

1472
02:05:28,400 --> 02:05:29,400
On themselves, yes.

1473
02:05:29,400 --> 02:05:30,400
Okay, cool.

1474
02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:36,400
Yeah, and then, here's another thing, seven new CS songs which are going to be exclusives,

1475
02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:40,160
including songs from L.E.D., Garouvi, and Megumi Uperslope.

1476
02:05:40,160 --> 02:05:43,040
surprised we're seeing a lot of the same people that were in 8th Style coming back

1477
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:47,400
but that's a good thing. New LED is always a good thing. If Meg wants to do

1478
02:05:47,400 --> 02:05:54,560
another video where she shows off a rack, fine by me. Yeah, I heard that, yeah! Take it off!

1479
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:59,360
And then the last one here is a remix version of the popular song

1480
02:05:59,360 --> 02:06:03,120
Usual Days from Pop'n Music is going to be on non-style CS.

1481
02:06:03,120 --> 02:06:07,280
Ooh, okay so we're getting a Pop'n Music remix. Now wasn't there another song

1482
02:06:07,280 --> 02:06:11,280
That song in 8th style that was crossed over from Poppin' Music as well?

1483
02:06:11,280 --> 02:06:13,280
Oh, that's Everyday Lovely Day by Rihanna.

1484
02:06:13,280 --> 02:06:17,280
Okay, yeah. And I love that song, so hopefully that's a good sign.

1485
02:06:17,280 --> 02:06:21,280
Alright, cool. Any other details on 9th style we know so far?

1486
02:06:21,280 --> 02:06:25,280
That's the last thing that was on the message.

1487
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:30,280
Okay. Very cool. So, I need to get back into 2DX. I'm so far behind.

1488
02:06:30,280 --> 02:06:36,280
I have to pick up 7th, 8th, and 9th style. But 9th style, seriously, is like my favorite song list since, like, 6th.

1489
02:06:36,280 --> 02:06:38,120
so i have to have to get it

1490
02:06:38,120 --> 02:06:39,280
so yeah

1491
02:06:39,280 --> 02:06:41,720
one of these days

1492
02:06:41,720 --> 02:06:44,080
idea any other news going on other

1493
02:06:44,080 --> 02:06:46,520
well this is the only one abroad so far

1494
02:06:46,520 --> 02:06:48,200
and i want to know

1495
02:06:48,200 --> 02:06:50,600
or any other any quick comments you make

1496
02:06:50,600 --> 02:06:52,000
well yeah

1497
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,000

02:07:01,860 --> 02:07:04,180
i i will have in videos in it

1502
02:07:04,180 --> 02:07:07,740
I have to zoom out to the goth club so I can look miserable tonight.

1503
02:07:07,740 --> 02:07:11,540
Well, probably after the goth club or something, or anytime.

1504
02:07:11,540 --> 02:07:14,740
I will make that happen.

1505
02:07:14,740 --> 02:07:18,380
Alright, thanks for calling my friend, I appreciate it. Have a good one, bud.

1506
02:07:18,380 --> 02:07:22,860
No problem. Bye-bye. And look at that, we're getting back-to-back phone calls tonight.

1507
02:07:22,860 --> 02:07:26,800
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Hey, Skye, it's El Mullet.

1508
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:30,980
Hello, El Mullet, how are you my friend? I am doing good, Skye. How about yourself?

1509
02:07:30,980 --> 02:07:33,980
I'm good. I'm very happy that lots of people are interacting with the show

1510
02:07:33,980 --> 02:07:35,640
tonight. This is making me very happy.

1511
02:07:35,640 --> 02:07:39,060
And you were sitting on hold there for quite a while, so I appreciate your patience.

1512
02:07:39,060 --> 02:07:43,200
No problem. Somebody beat you to the punch a little earlier. What's new, buddy?

1513
02:07:43,200 --> 02:07:48,580
Not much new. Took it to the ITG guy, like I said I was going to do last week.

1514
02:07:48,580 --> 02:07:52,440
Ah, yes, I remember this. You were having it out with the ITG guy in your column

1515
02:07:52,440 --> 02:07:54,080
over on Inside Pulse.

1516
02:07:54,080 --> 02:07:58,520
Yes, I was. Any feedback from that so far?

1517
02:07:58,520 --> 02:08:05,520
Well, not direct feedback, except actually one person directly replied to the column on the site

1518
02:08:05,520 --> 02:08:15,520
saying that he tried In the Groove and wasn't too impressed. He said it didn't have the thorough polish that DDR had.

1519
02:08:15,520 --> 02:08:23,520
You know what? That is my, I think, issue with it too, is that polish isn't there. I think that's a really good term for it.

1520
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:26,520
kind of the same thing I was saying about that Biddy Head song that was in

1521
02:08:26,520 --> 02:08:30,600
Cage Match tonight. The polish isn't quite there. I don't know how else to...

1522
02:08:30,600 --> 02:08:33,540
There's no other way to put it. But that, yeah, I would agree that that's my

1523
02:08:33,540 --> 02:08:37,460
problem with In the Groove 2. Yeah. Is that it feels like a fan mix. It feels

1524
02:08:37,460 --> 02:08:43,000
like a bootleg. All that has happened now is one appears in my area so I

1525
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:47,840
can try it for myself so I can develop an opinion on it. Or you win the Come to

1526
02:08:47,840 --> 02:08:52,480
Orange Lawns radio contest that will happen. At this rate, we're gonna save our

1527
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:58,960
jelly bellies and that contest will be happening in 2008 so we'll see hopefully

1528
02:08:58,960 --> 02:09:02,640
some if I can ever get a boatload of money the first thing I'm gonna do with

1529
02:09:02,640 --> 02:09:05,920
it is to fly out and see you guys well now you got a wedding coming up right

1530
02:09:05,920 --> 02:09:10,480
yes you got a wedding you got to spend it on the missus first but then I do yes

1531
02:09:10,480 --> 02:09:16,160
I do then we're talking like lots of money oh hey this makes me this makes me

1532
02:09:16,160 --> 02:09:18,720
think of a topic we were just talking about earlier does your girlfriend or

1533
02:09:18,720 --> 02:09:26,440
your fiance? Is she into DDR? She knows I play it. She's not too into it because she

1534
02:09:26,440 --> 02:09:36,460
can't play very well. Something's wrong with her leg. She can walk normally, but she's

1535
02:09:36,460 --> 02:09:40,760
had some surgeries in the past that she can't necessarily play. I know folks like that and

1536
02:09:40,760 --> 02:09:45,760
they just have a hard time playing. Actually, Rice Princess, I don't think she has a problem

1537
02:09:45,760 --> 02:09:49,520
saying this. Rice Princess actually doesn't play a whole lot of DDR because she had surgery

1538
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:54,120
on her leg some time ago and it causes her not to be able, I mean she can play it like,

1539
02:09:54,120 --> 02:09:59,480
but she can't play it as intensively as most of the addicts do, if you know what I mean.

1540
02:09:59,480 --> 02:10:04,080
Right, I mean I tried getting her into it like when we first started going out and nothing

1541
02:10:04,080 --> 02:10:09,720
doing so I said, okay, you got your opinion, that's fine. I did get her into Pokemon though.

1542
02:10:09,720 --> 02:10:13,680
There you go, see there's got to be a given to, see, but even though she's not into DDR,

1543
02:10:13,680 --> 02:10:18,560
it worked, right? Definitely. Definitely. Is there anything that your girlfriend did

1544
02:10:18,560 --> 02:10:27,200
that maybe at first you were like, okay, I gotta learn how to like that? Well, nothing

1545
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:30,240
I can think of on the top of my head. It's probably for the best. Keeps you out of trouble

1546
02:10:30,240 --> 02:10:36,680
that way. Yeah. Any other stuff going on at Inside Pulps this week we should be aware

1547
02:10:36,680 --> 02:10:47,080
of? Um, I think we have something new coming up. Sometime in the future we're going to

1548
02:10:47,080 --> 02:10:54,560
have a Shining Force feature pop up. And what is that all about? There's an RPG series of

1549
02:10:54,560 --> 02:11:05,400
Shining Force. Cool. Alright, so what else was I going to ask you bud? I was going to

1550
02:11:05,400 --> 02:11:09,400
Okay, if you want to post a link to your recent column in the chatroom, go for it.

1551
02:11:09,400 --> 02:11:10,400
Yes, sir.

1552
02:11:10,400 --> 02:11:13,960
You have our full blessing on that, so, because you give, you're very kind to give us a lot

1553
02:11:13,960 --> 02:11:16,600
of shout-outs in your column, so it's only fair.

1554
02:11:16,600 --> 02:11:19,280
Something like shamelessly shilling my own site.

1555
02:11:19,280 --> 02:11:20,800
Yeah, nothing like it.

1556
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:23,960
That's why people call into this show, really, is to whore out their own projects, honestly,

1557
02:11:23,960 --> 02:11:25,520
but that's alright, we don't mind.

1558
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:28,720
Come to my website.

1559
02:11:28,720 --> 02:11:29,720
Anything else you want to share?

1560
02:11:29,720 --> 02:11:32,040
Any comments on what we talked about in the show?

1561
02:11:32,040 --> 02:11:36,600
Actually, I gotta get going real quick, so.

1562
02:11:36,600 --> 02:11:40,080
Okay, well that's fair by me. Alright, have a good one, bud. Thanks for calling.

1563
02:11:40,080 --> 02:11:43,720
Alright, later. Alright.

1564
02:11:43,720 --> 02:11:48,560
You're showing off my fridge? You've been playing over there on the webcam

1565
02:11:48,560 --> 02:11:53,640
like crazy, haven't you, DarkSakura? All of a sudden, I saw in the chat room

1566
02:11:53,640 --> 02:11:54,640
somebody had posted,

1567
02:11:54,640 --> 02:12:00,720
Jamie's hot! Look at that, I see it right there. Jamie is so hot.

1568
02:12:00,720 --> 02:12:03,760
says dark night. Alright.

1569
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:07,160
Jamie's selling it on the webcam tonight. Awesome. Alright.

1570
02:12:07,160 --> 02:12:11,160
Fine, put my magnets on the cam. Don't

1571
02:12:11,160 --> 02:12:14,960
eff up the TV with the magnetic fields and all that stuff. That would make me cry.

1572
02:12:14,960 --> 02:12:18,640
Alright.

1573
02:12:18,640 --> 02:12:22,680
Let's see. We have the Skype line still open if you guys want to call in. We'll

1574
02:12:22,680 --> 02:12:26,640
keep it open a few more minutes for you guys just in case you want to call in

1575
02:12:26,640 --> 02:12:27,040
there.

1576
02:12:27,040 --> 02:12:31,600
Um, I'm trying to think of what else is going on in the scene right now. There's really-

1577
02:12:31,600 --> 02:12:35,400
Oh, Angel, you have a comment? Gettin' up there?

1578
02:12:35,400 --> 02:12:40,320
Um, I don't know. Well, actually, it's something that all of us can make fun of,

1579
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:43,680
because- oops. Okay, um,

1580
02:12:43,680 --> 02:12:47,360
A.I.M., or A.I.M., came up with a-

1581
02:12:47,360 --> 02:12:50,080
Okay, wait, hold this thought because I'm gonna go off on this for a little bit. I know where you're

1582
02:12:50,080 --> 02:12:51,800
going. I want to talk about this in detail a little bit.

1583
02:12:51,800 --> 02:12:56,000
Okay, never mind. Um, you didn't hear anything. Yeah, uh, raise it from your minds.

1584
02:12:56,000 --> 02:13:00,000
This is what we get for not preparing this show in advance, so that's fine.

1585
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
You've dealt with that for years, you'll continue to love us.

1586
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
We're going to go to the Skype line.

1587
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
Hi, you're on Orange Arms Radio.

1588
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:10,000
This is Dark Knight with a shameless plug to get O.L.R. on the East Coast.

1589
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:11,000
Please, kid.

1590
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:21,000
You know, actually, somebody, one of our buddies, it was John Fields, I believe, wanted to do an outside the box East Coast version or something like that,

1591
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
and I said, eh, what the hell.

1592
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:24,000
Sure, go for it.

1593
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:28,500
I don't know if that project ended up taking off or what, but I guess not, because I haven't heard anything else about it.

1594
02:13:28,500 --> 02:13:35,500
OLR East Coast. You know, I'd love it. If it was in the budget of jelly beans and cashews, I would do it, but you know...

1595
02:13:35,500 --> 02:13:37,000
And the sun-dried tomatoes.

1596
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:40,500
Sorry, and the sun-dried tomatoes. I can't forget about that. It's a third of the budget.

1597
02:13:40,500 --> 02:13:44,000
I think that we add a vote of our budget to add spinach to.

1598
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:48,000
We'll see. You know what? We're going to have to fire somebody to add the spinach.

1599
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:49,000
Sorry, Angel.

1600
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:54,000
We need spinach more than an archive.

1601
02:13:54,000 --> 02:14:00,000
Alright, Dark Knight, if we were to come out to the East Coast as Orange Lounge Radio, what would we do?

1602
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:05,000
Where would we be doing our show from, and what kinds of stuff would we report on, do you think?

1603
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:10,000
Let's see, I would probably have y'all in New York, in the middle of nowhere.

1604
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:13,000
Very fine, very fine.

1605
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:16,000
Cover it in the groove.

1606
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:20,000
Oh no, that's it. This project's cancelled.

1607
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:24,000
No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I would do a show

1608
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:28,000
live from 8 on the break with my ass planted on the

1609
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:32,000
up arrow of the in the groove machine if we had the money for it.

1610
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:36,000
And Jamie could have her ass planted on the down arrow on the two player side. And Loki,

1611
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:40,000
I don't know about him.

1612
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:44,000
Since I hardly ever get to do this,

1613
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:48,000
Hey, cause you know me and my public urination.

1614
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:53,000
Oh, I think I just started to piss Dane again.

1615
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:56,000
No, no, don't go there buddy, don't go there.

1616
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:00,000
Loki could be on the Para Para machine. That's a little ways down.

1617
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:04,000
And he could be doing his white freestyle on that.

1618
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:09,000
Yeah, but like I said, give OLR money so they can bring him to the east coast.

1619
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:12,000
I like that give OLR money idea.

1620
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:15,200
idea. In fact, people have been telling us we should open up a Paypal thing for the longest

1621
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:22,000
time, a give OLR money thing. We do have the unofficial give OLR money thing. You can Paypal

1622
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:29,160
to nightmare underscore hunter at yahoo dot com. Any amount of money is fine. All that

1623
02:15:29,160 --> 02:15:36,000
money will not be going to tsunami relief. But you can, you can give it to me and I,

1624
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:42,000
I might. If the price is right, I might. No, I won't.

1625
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:47,300
Okay. No, no. That is not the give OLR money. That is make Loki's porn collection bigger

1626
02:15:47,300 --> 02:15:51,300
fund, okay? That is all you're going to do is make it. Buy porn? Who buys porn?

1627
02:15:51,300 --> 02:15:59,500
Send to jamie at orangeboundradio.com your links to your PayPal accounts and passwords.

1628
02:15:59,500 --> 02:16:04,940
And the money will be well used to fund my, um, let's go visit everybody.

1629
02:16:04,940 --> 02:16:08,460
Yeah, and not go to work.

1630
02:16:08,460 --> 02:16:12,660
Yeah, right? The pay our rent. We'll have the Orange Lounge RV.

1631
02:16:12,660 --> 02:16:17,660
How about that? Dude, we'd be like the freakin' Partridge Family. That'd be rad.

1632
02:16:17,660 --> 02:16:22,140
Maybe we'd get our own cult. If we could wing it. If we had the money

1633
02:16:22,140 --> 02:16:26,980
and we could all get like a week off of work, I would pile us all in a van and we'd

1634
02:16:26,980 --> 02:16:28,200
drive around the country

1635
02:16:28,200 --> 02:16:33,100
for a week. My work only gives leave of absence and increments of 30 days, so hey, that

1636
02:16:33,100 --> 02:16:33,940
works for me.

1637
02:16:33,940 --> 02:16:35,940
Do I get to come or am I still fired?

1638
02:16:36,940 --> 02:16:39,940
It depends if the spinach can come or not.

1639
02:16:39,940 --> 02:16:40,940
No.

1640
02:16:40,940 --> 02:16:43,940
The spinach would probably be consumed, so I guess you can come.

1641
02:16:43,940 --> 02:16:46,940
I like spinach, so, yeah.

1642
02:16:47,940 --> 02:16:49,940
What can I say, Dark Knight? I love the idea.

1643
02:16:49,940 --> 02:16:53,940
I'd love to do the East Coast and talk about DDR out there, the whole scene out there,

1644
02:16:53,940 --> 02:16:58,940
but until we have the money, we rely on you guys to report on the East Coast scene for us.

1645
02:16:58,940 --> 02:16:59,940
You can give us money.

1646
02:16:59,940 --> 02:17:00,940
It's all good.

1647
02:17:00,940 --> 02:17:05,940
What is going on on the East Coast scene right now? What's so freaking great about In the Groove anyway?

1648
02:17:05,940 --> 02:17:10,940
Well actually I'm in Richmond so I will never see In the Groove, knock on wood.

1649
02:17:10,940 --> 02:17:13,940
What else is going on on the East Coast then?

1650
02:17:13,940 --> 02:17:18,940
Nothing much right now. I'm still kind of griping over the fact that we no longer have 2DX.

1651
02:17:18,940 --> 02:17:20,940
Aww, what happened?

1652
02:17:20,940 --> 02:17:26,940
The machine wasn't taken care of so they basically, the people up there called it a dead weight and got rid of it.

1653
02:17:26,940 --> 02:17:28,940
No, that sucks.

1654
02:17:28,940 --> 02:17:33,940
I think the last thing they did was put an upgrade in this machine to a V3, and that was it.

1655
02:17:58,940 --> 02:18:05,000
the show interesting because Lord knows we're not good at it. Just kidding. We're

1656
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:09,640
gonna go to another break and in this break and let's do some U.S. DDR music.

1657
02:18:09,640 --> 02:18:15,780
Why not? And I know if I don't start it off with this song that Jamie will kill

1658
02:18:15,780 --> 02:18:20,160
me. Well we can't have that can we? We cannot. So we'll be back after this with

1659
02:18:20,160 --> 02:18:27,160
more orange on radio and the F use of the week coming up

1660
02:18:50,160 --> 02:18:57,160
It would be a much better sight, with you, with me

1661
02:18:57,160 --> 02:19:04,160
If you hadn't met me, I'd be fine on my own, baby

1662
02:19:04,160 --> 02:19:10,160
Never felt so lonely then you, came along

1663
02:19:10,160 --> 02:19:15,160
Let me hide and be fine on my own, baby

1664
02:19:15,160 --> 02:19:20,160
Never felt so lonely then you came along

1665
02:19:20,160 --> 02:19:24,160
So now what should I do?

1666
02:19:24,160 --> 02:19:27,160
I'm strung out, addicted to you

1667
02:19:27,160 --> 02:19:31,160
My body aches, now that you're gone

1668
02:19:31,160 --> 02:19:35,160
My supplies fell through

1669
02:19:35,160 --> 02:19:40,160
And they gave me everything you had and more

1670
02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:42,160
You craved my happiness

1671
02:19:42,160 --> 02:19:46,160
When you made me feel joy and made you smile

1672
02:19:46,160 --> 02:19:49,160
But now I feel your stress

1673
02:19:49,160 --> 02:19:54,160
Love was never meant to be such a crazy affair, no

1674
02:19:54,160 --> 02:19:56,160
And who had time but you?

1675
02:19:56,160 --> 02:20:02,160
Never thought I'd sit around and unravel your love

1676
02:20:32,160 --> 02:20:37,160
Leave me alone if I'm not right

1677
02:20:37,160 --> 02:20:38,160
And why?

1678
02:20:38,160 --> 02:20:41,160
You leave me alone so many days

1679
02:20:41,160 --> 02:20:45,160
You're thinking of you so many nights

1680
02:20:45,160 --> 02:20:50,160
Leave me alone if I'm not right

1681
02:20:50,160 --> 02:20:52,160
Tell me why

1682
02:20:57,160 --> 02:20:59,160
Now tell me why

1683
02:20:59,160 --> 02:21:01,160
I don't know what to do

1684
02:21:01,160 --> 02:21:03,160
I don't know what to do

1685
02:21:03,160 --> 02:21:05,160
I don't know what to do

1686
02:21:05,160 --> 02:21:07,160
Why?

1687
02:21:35,160 --> 02:22:00,120
Let me tell you something you don't know

1688
02:22:00,120 --> 02:22:28,120
Let me tell you somethin' you don't know Let me tell you somethin' you don't know

1689
02:22:28,120 --> 02:22:36,540
Let me tell you something you don't know

1690
02:22:36,540 --> 02:22:43,840
Let me tell you something you don't know

1691
02:22:43,840 --> 02:22:50,680
Take you deep those secrets I once saw

1692
02:22:50,680 --> 02:22:56,600
Take you deep those secrets I once saw

1693
02:23:26,600 --> 02:23:28,600

02:26:55,000 --> 02:27:00,620
fun of if we wanted to I was talking to sky on aim earlier just chatting it up

1716
02:27:00,620 --> 02:27:06,920
and then I saw a little link that was something about you know an AOL instant

1717
02:27:06,920 --> 02:27:10,800
messenger game but it had something to do with dancing and I was kind of

1718
02:27:10,800 --> 02:27:15,760
intrigued to click on it but then you know I didn't want it because it was

1719
02:27:15,760 --> 02:27:19,640
gonna charge me money after a certain amount of songs and whatever but I was

1720
02:27:19,640 --> 02:27:23,640
almost tempted just to see how crappy it was gonna be or good or however but you

1721
02:27:23,640 --> 02:27:29,280
know if it has to do with aim usually it's crappy right? Well we will see so I

1722
02:27:29,280 --> 02:27:34,160
investigated a little bit here and sure enough there is this new game that's

1723
02:27:34,160 --> 02:27:38,360
showing up on AOL on the instant messenger in the games portion called

1724
02:27:38,360 --> 02:27:44,000
groov-o-matic is the name of this game it's groov-o-matic and I'm actually

1725
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:47,320
downloading it and installing it right now so if you're hearing a couple skips

1726
02:27:47,320 --> 02:27:52,880
and things like that I apologize we're just moving in here so let's go ahead

1727
02:27:52,880 --> 02:27:59,960
and see if we can't get in this groove-o-matic game now angel you

1728
02:27:59,960 --> 02:28:05,960
actually didn't check this out yet all I know is that you get one character and

1729
02:28:05,960 --> 02:28:09,680
ten songs for free and then you have to pay after that I believe that's that's

1730
02:28:09,680 --> 02:28:14,360
all I know about it but we'll see in about a few minutes if it's any good or

1731
02:28:14,360 --> 02:28:21,320
Now, this is a game made by Wild Tangent, which I know AdAware recognizes. This is an

1732
02:28:21,320 --> 02:28:26,320
AdBot. So I have just installed an AdBot on my computer for you people. So you better

1733
02:28:26,320 --> 02:28:32,220
appreciate this sneak preview of Groove-O-Matic. Okay, so I'm going to go into single-player

1734
02:28:32,220 --> 02:28:35,660
mode here, and we're going to go into Groove-O-Matic. I just want to hear what kind of songs this

1735
02:28:35,660 --> 02:28:43,040
Groove-O-Matic game has. Let's see here. Oh, yes, it's saying Wild Tangent. This is off

1736
02:28:43,040 --> 02:28:50,080
the company that made this game. Groovy little songs there. Oh, we're going full screen.

1737
02:28:50,080 --> 02:28:55,140
Let's see. I'm going to do this dance to the beat option. Oh, look at that. You get little

1738
02:28:55,140 --> 02:29:03,040
characters. There's a mama on the right side there with big chichis. Her character's got

1739
02:29:03,040 --> 02:29:10,180
some chichis there. It's her name's Janet. And now I can. Okay, there's only one song

1740
02:29:10,180 --> 02:29:14,420
I can play in this mini version. It's called La Fiesta. You guys ready to see La Fiesta?

1741
02:29:16,020 --> 02:29:21,340
All right, yeah, they should be able to hear this. Okay, so I'm gonna play the song. Let's see what happens.

1742
02:29:25,420 --> 02:29:29,660
Oh, is this like Busta Move? It's kind of set up like it. Let's see what happens.

1743
02:29:30,980 --> 02:29:32,980
Loki, run commentary while I play.

1744
02:29:32,980 --> 02:29:55,980
This game is just like Bust-A-Move. This isn't DDR at all. It's what?

1745
02:29:55,980 --> 02:30:07,920
it's what this song is really hot by the way okay wait I'm gonna back out okay I

1746
02:30:07,920 --> 02:30:11,960
hit escape because there's actually it looks like there's a mode in there that

1747
02:30:11,960 --> 02:30:17,940
is something about freestyle like you can play with your own mp3 so I'm gonna

1748
02:30:17,940 --> 02:30:21,940
I'm going to do that mode. Let's see if I can do it.

1749
02:30:21,940 --> 02:30:25,940
Oh goody, I can.

1750
02:30:25,940 --> 02:30:29,940
Let's see if I can find it. What would be a good song to dance to in freestyle mode?

1751
02:30:29,940 --> 02:30:33,940
No, we're not going to do Girls.

1752
02:30:33,940 --> 02:30:37,940
I want to do something amusing here.

1753
02:30:37,940 --> 02:30:41,940
It doesn't want to work. Oh shoot.

1754
02:30:41,940 --> 02:30:45,940
Okay, well hopefully I have something in this folder.

1755
02:30:45,940 --> 02:31:08,940
I'm already getting really bad glitches here. Okay, there we go, it fixed itself. Let's see, what's the song I can do here? Sorry guys. Okay, here we go. We're going to do this song. Let's see how this works.

1756
02:31:08,940 --> 02:31:33,700
p0k3smot42o

1757
02:31:33,700 --> 02:31:35,700
kostjamrh And no music!

1758
02:32:03,700 --> 02:32:09,700
What the hell? Dude, this is like the guy game but not.

1759
02:32:09,700 --> 02:32:15,700
It's not even playing the damn MP3 I told it to play. That's hokey.

1760
02:32:15,700 --> 02:32:19,700
Okay, what can we say? That was interesting to say the least.

1761
02:32:19,700 --> 02:32:21,700
That was retarded.

1762
02:32:21,700 --> 02:32:25,700
But it had Buster Groove and DER stuff in it. That's kind of weird.

1763
02:32:25,700 --> 02:32:27,700
That blows.

1764
02:32:27,700 --> 02:32:30,700
It stole ideas from two games there. What's that about?

1765
02:32:30,700 --> 02:32:32,700
That blows hard.

1766
02:32:32,700 --> 02:32:37,580
Alright, well I can't believe we're going to advertise this game that we just did there.

1767
02:32:37,580 --> 02:32:42,780
If you want to check this out for yourself, open up AOL Instant Messenger and look on

1768
02:32:42,780 --> 02:32:45,660
your games panel because it's right there waiting for you to play.

1769
02:32:45,660 --> 02:32:47,700
So have at it people.

1770
02:32:47,700 --> 02:32:49,980
And I'm sorry we were not able to put that on the cam.

1771
02:32:49,980 --> 02:32:52,980
We'll try to do that next week for you guys because we have to actually load it on a different

1772
02:32:52,980 --> 02:32:53,980
computer to do that.

1773
02:32:53,980 --> 02:32:58,380
And that would involve putting spyware on Loki's computer.

1774
02:32:58,380 --> 02:33:04,200
Alright, thank you, thank you so much for bringing this show down with that crappy game,

1775
02:33:04,200 --> 02:33:05,200
Angel.

1776
02:33:05,200 --> 02:33:09,560
I knew it was gonna be a crappy game, I just thought it was slightly worth bringing up.

1777
02:33:09,560 --> 02:33:14,320
It's not, to that game's credit, it's not as bad as some of the knockoff games I've

1778
02:33:14,320 --> 02:33:15,880
seen out there available for download.

1779
02:33:15,880 --> 02:33:19,520
What was that one that had all the classical music in MIDI format, it was by like Gamehouse

1780
02:33:19,520 --> 02:33:20,520
or something?

1781
02:33:20,520 --> 02:33:21,800
It was Tap a Jam, wasn't it?

1782
02:33:21,800 --> 02:33:22,800
Tap a Jam.

1783
02:33:22,800 --> 02:33:26,440
That game was, oh boy, oh that game was bad.

1784
02:33:26,440 --> 02:33:29,440
That was a bad game.

1785
02:33:29,440 --> 02:33:34,440
I was thinking it was a retarded Flash Flash Revolution or something like that.

1786
02:33:34,440 --> 02:33:39,440
Alright, we are going to go into the FUs of the Week.

1787
02:33:39,440 --> 02:33:41,440
It's that time. Are you guys ready?

1788
02:33:41,440 --> 02:33:45,440
Jamie, why is it that we have to do the FUs of the Week every single week?

1789
02:33:45,440 --> 02:33:48,440
Because we're not going to take it anymore.

1790
02:33:48,440 --> 02:34:14,320
A big SU goes of course to the usual traffic, fog, sunny skies that get in my eyes.

1791
02:34:14,320 --> 02:34:20,640
I think I had to do it just being sick when I was out in the Bay Area on Friday.

1792
02:34:20,640 --> 02:34:25,940
And also a big F.U. to not being able to purchase Twinbee for the Game Boy Advance because Network

1793
02:34:25,940 --> 02:34:26,940
had it.

1794
02:34:26,940 --> 02:34:31,140
And a big F.U. to Nintendo for giving them better packaging in Japan because the old

1795
02:34:31,140 --> 02:34:33,340
releases are really awesome looking.

1796
02:34:33,340 --> 02:34:39,480
They come in very tiny versions of the original boxes.

1797
02:34:39,480 --> 02:34:46,480
Another FU goes toward time, distance, lack of money, um, school starting next week.

1798
02:34:46,480 --> 02:34:53,480
Really, this is not a whole bunch I'm overly angsty about immediately.

1799
02:34:53,480 --> 02:34:54,480
Shock?

1800
02:34:54,480 --> 02:35:05,480
Uh, yeah, and uh, an FU to uh, not being able to install certain games on my system yet.

1801
02:35:05,480 --> 02:35:10,480
And Gravity for being assholes, and Ragnarok Online 2 for not being out yet.

1802
02:35:10,480 --> 02:35:14,480
That's it. Oh, and the scale at the damn gym.

1803
02:35:14,480 --> 02:35:19,480
Oh dear, alright. Moving on! Loki, your turn.

1804
02:35:22,480 --> 02:35:29,480
I'm fucking tired now. Um, nearly a few of the week goes to me for being stupid and making a dumb mistake.

1805
02:35:29,480 --> 02:35:41,320
So, yeah. And, um, fuck you to, um, actually to Tahoe Joe's for ruining mashed potatoes.

1806
02:35:41,320 --> 02:35:46,760
They single-handedly ruined something that's so simple as mashed potatoes by trying to

1807
02:35:46,760 --> 02:35:51,720
put scallions in it. Never ever fucking do that again. It's just nasty, it just tastes

1808
02:35:51,720 --> 02:36:03,400
one giant onion is not good so it's a hell of thin and um that's pretty much it i'm done wow

1809
02:36:03,400 --> 02:36:13,960
you guys are quick tonight f you to the lack of angst in the room tonight what is up with that

1810
02:36:15,080 --> 02:36:20,200
um i don't know i you know what i hate to be on the same page but i really have a lot of the same

1811
02:36:20,200 --> 02:36:27,720
if you if you to difficult situations like I just I kind of like there was

1812
02:36:27,720 --> 02:36:31,720
like a somebody proposed something to me this is gonna sound dirty but it's not I

1813
02:36:31,720 --> 02:36:36,000
sort of got somebody kind of proposed something interesting out there like and

1814
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:40,320
it has to do with my professional career I got an interesting proposal and I'm

1815
02:36:40,320 --> 02:36:45,400
really torn I don't know what to do so I'm just gonna kind of put my hand out

1816
02:36:45,400 --> 02:36:49,040
there and kind of see what happens see if it's gonna be a good thing but but I

1817
02:36:49,040 --> 02:36:56,040
I fear change, fundamentally, and F you to that. F you to that, um, fear, I guess, of change.

1818
02:36:56,040 --> 02:37:07,040
Otherwise, I really don't have a lot to be angsty about. Um, F you to myself for not getting, um, not getting a healthy amount of sleep lately, but it's okay.

1819
02:37:07,040 --> 02:37:09,040
It's for a good cause.

1820
02:37:09,040 --> 02:37:12,040
Jamie, you're giving me concerned slash funny look.

1821
02:37:12,040 --> 02:37:13,040
What?

1822
02:37:13,040 --> 02:37:14,040
I'm not saying anything.

1823
02:37:14,040 --> 02:37:15,040
Fine.

1824
02:37:15,040 --> 02:37:17,040
Oh, actually, if I can speak something in.

1825
02:37:17,040 --> 02:37:18,040
Sure.

1826
02:37:18,040 --> 02:37:22,040
Thank you to my voice for deciding it and doing the work.

1827
02:37:48,040 --> 02:37:53,360
try to pass those ones up I don't remember which one I don't remember it

1828
02:37:53,360 --> 02:37:59,240
just what's new this week that pissed you off three hours show buddy all right

1829
02:37:59,240 --> 02:38:03,580
if you for having a third crack in my fucking window over debris over a

1830
02:38:03,580 --> 02:38:11,080
freaking storm again three cracks in a window off in one whole month that a

1831
02:38:11,080 --> 02:38:18,080
that fucking bitch. F you for school for starting next week. There goes packing up some of the

1832
02:38:18,920 --> 02:38:25,920
books again. F you with everybody trying to make my tournament a joke again with the piss.

1833
02:38:26,640 --> 02:38:33,640
It's funny. Come on. It's not a joke. It's just a tournament just like everything else.

1834
02:38:33,640 --> 02:38:39,640
It's not the things you take a piss on or whatever.

1835
02:38:39,640 --> 02:38:48,640
And FU to people who want to start drama privately and sending their private messages to me privately.

1836
02:38:48,640 --> 02:38:54,640
Just cause you don't like somebody in this term does not mean you guys are not gonna get along.

1837
02:38:54,640 --> 02:38:59,640
Get over it, wait till the tournament comes in, that's all it is.

1838
02:38:59,640 --> 02:39:05,220
If it comes to people begging for the freaking song list for the tournament god damn it

1839
02:39:05,220 --> 02:39:07,920
I told you the list is gonna be 16 songs

1840
02:39:09,340 --> 02:39:14,080
That is all nothing else. I will not reveal it to the tournament. I said on the rules

1841
02:39:15,020 --> 02:39:17,440
deal with this next person who

1842
02:39:18,180 --> 02:39:21,500
Next person who mentions this in private will be banned for my tournament

1843
02:39:22,180 --> 02:39:26,540
Seriously getting a headache with all these people kind of complain and bitch

1844
02:39:26,540 --> 02:39:35,740
about some things that should not be fished about and an FE goes to a stroke

1845
02:39:35,740 --> 02:39:44,340
that my grandmother just recently had. It's pretty depressing. I don't really want to say

1846
02:39:44,340 --> 02:39:53,380
this in the FEs but yeah, strokes suck. An FE goes from misplanned from

1847
02:39:53,380 --> 02:39:57,620
plans being all mixed up on Friday I was supposed to go to I was supposedly

1848
02:39:57,620 --> 02:40:03,620
supposed to go to Camp Canada's freestyle meetup but things got mixed

1849
02:40:03,620 --> 02:40:09,700
up so I have to go to Reno with a few people so I was planned earlier before the meetup.

1850
02:40:09,700 --> 02:40:14,360
And if he goes from the same people who are complaining about the religious

1851
02:40:14,360 --> 02:40:19,900
issue over some games or since if or should I say censorship issues just

1852
02:40:19,900 --> 02:40:34,900
It's because something that has explicit content or whatever, or they think it's offensive, like a puppet of Maria from Banya think it's too religiously offensive, is a reason why the puppet was removed from the Paradise Island.

1853
02:40:34,900 --> 02:40:36,900
You have got to be kidding me.

1854
02:40:36,900 --> 02:40:38,900
I shit you not.

1855
02:40:38,900 --> 02:40:40,900
Why is that song offensive?

1856
02:40:40,900 --> 02:40:43,900
Because it says Ave Maria. I don't see how that...

1857
02:40:43,900 --> 02:40:48,900
It means Hail Mary. I don't see how that is offending a Christian group.

1858
02:40:48,900 --> 02:40:53,080
It doesn't say Ave Maria set your child on fire.

1859
02:40:53,080 --> 02:40:56,880
I mean, come on. They're probably thinking it's blasphemous or something.

1860
02:40:56,880 --> 02:41:01,440
Oh my god, you gotta be kidding me. I thought that I left Alabama, what's up with this?

1861
02:41:01,440 --> 02:41:04,800
Fuck Christians! I hate the goddamn stupid

1862
02:41:04,800 --> 02:41:08,720
super Christians out there that want to convert all the evils in the world.

1863
02:41:08,720 --> 02:41:13,160
It's you people that ruin our TV and ruin our radio and music.

1864
02:41:13,160 --> 02:41:16,800
Goddamn it, if I want to see boobies flash by accident on TV,

1865
02:41:16,800 --> 02:41:24,800
That's my god-given right, and if your children don't happen to catch those boobies, it's time to tell them about life, because guess what?

1866
02:41:24,800 --> 02:41:27,800
One day or another they're gonna see them, and that's that.

1867
02:41:27,800 --> 02:41:38,800
You know what? If your children catch sight of boobies or happen to hear shit, fuck, damn, no matter what on TV or the radio, it's your fault for not censoring them, okay?

1868
02:41:38,800 --> 02:41:42,800
The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio are absolutely true.

1869
02:41:42,800 --> 02:41:51,800
Do your goddamn job and stop blaming the media for screwing up babysitting your children when it's not their responsibility.

1870
02:41:51,800 --> 02:41:58,800
If you're gonna get knocked up and have the kid, you need to take some goddamn responsibility, okay?

1871
02:41:58,800 --> 02:42:01,800
You know what's funny though about the religious issue?

1872
02:42:01,800 --> 02:42:07,800
I do want to point out, Loki was giving an F.U. to what we coined super-Christians.

1873
02:42:07,800 --> 02:42:16,300
Not all Christians, okay? You can be religious and be one with God and all that stuff. That's fine. That's your right as an American, freedom of religion.

1874
02:42:16,300 --> 02:42:23,800
But remember, freedom of religion means I'm free to choose my religion as well. Got it? Good.

1875
02:42:23,800 --> 02:42:31,800
You know what's funny about the situation? Christians say they want to stand up to themselves, yet they commit a sin.

1876
02:42:31,800 --> 02:42:41,800
A sin of wrath, of anger, saying this thing is offensive. They go outrageous to the management and patent-vending themselves.

1877
02:42:41,800 --> 02:42:46,800
And now they're doing almost the same thing to DDR because Haizal Fu says the word fuck in it.

1878
02:42:46,800 --> 02:42:53,800
And they're trying to get rid of DDR and try to screw my tournament over. If they want to screw my tournament over...

1879
02:42:53,800 --> 02:42:54,800
I'm not sure if that was...

1880
02:42:54,800 --> 02:42:55,800
Finger on the cam, okay.

1881
02:42:55,800 --> 02:42:57,800
Yeah. Obviously.

1882
02:42:57,800 --> 02:43:00,800
I actually need to fill in FU.

1883
02:43:00,800 --> 02:43:06,300
I feed it to the majority of humanity for being stupid, and for sucking.

1884
02:43:08,300 --> 02:43:14,300
And now I have to censor my props for this tournament so these don't go too far, so I can't use my fuck you head, or...

1885
02:43:14,800 --> 02:43:19,800
I have to put a... I have to put a white label so it doesn't show fuck you on this.

1886
02:43:20,300 --> 02:43:23,300
I can't bring vibrators on the tournament, or the props.

1887
02:43:23,300 --> 02:43:30,300
I can't bring barbed wire, I can't bring glass, I can't bring a tit cup that I have

1888
02:43:30,300 --> 02:43:35,300
and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. That results in provoking the media.

1889
02:43:35,300 --> 02:43:41,300
It's because I don't want to get sued unless I do a counter-loss and people stand up for me.

1890
02:43:41,300 --> 02:43:51,300
And let's see. Well, since I don't know which FDs got into last week's show, I just have to say,

1891
02:43:51,300 --> 02:43:54,300
to be continued for now

1892
02:43:54,300 --> 02:43:57,980
oh good we'll finish this show in three hours after all all right Arkadian your

1893
02:43:57,980 --> 02:44:00,660
turn

1894
02:44:00,660 --> 02:44:04,300
fuck you this cold is hanging around still

1895
02:44:04,300 --> 02:44:06,100
even the potholes have

1896
02:44:06,100 --> 02:44:09,900
shown up like in the last month or near my work

1897
02:44:09,900 --> 02:44:12,380
every day is just like another fucking pothole on the road

1898
02:44:12,380 --> 02:44:19,380
like for all of the places that have wanted to avoid the damn thing

1899
02:44:29,980 --> 02:44:33,060
uh... if you're being sick earlier this week seems like that's going around

1900
02:44:33,060 --> 02:44:36,740
around here

1901
02:44:36,740 --> 02:44:38,900
yeah i don't

1902
02:44:38,900 --> 02:44:42,860
and he just was starting on tuesday because i don't want to go but whatever

1903
02:44:42,860 --> 02:44:44,240
it's my

1904
02:44:44,240 --> 02:44:45,400
educational hit

1905
02:44:45,400 --> 02:44:47,240
goals or something

1906
02:44:47,240 --> 02:44:50,100
and uh... i don't want to

1907
02:44:50,100 --> 02:44:54,420
work tomorrow but i got it anyway

1908
02:44:54,420 --> 02:44:56,760
that kind of sucks and uh...

1909
02:44:56,760 --> 02:44:59,320
i guess that's it because i can't think of uh...

1910
02:44:59,320 --> 02:45:03,380
the fps i was going to think of so whatever

1911
02:45:03,380 --> 02:45:07,860
with one notable exception uh... the uh... room here is pretty not

1912
02:45:07,860 --> 02:45:11,940
angsty tonight. We're pretty, we have a lack of angst tonight. I'm trying to keep it as a three hour show.

1913
02:45:11,940 --> 02:45:12,980
Shut up, exception.

1914
02:45:12,980 --> 02:45:19,980
Alright. So let's go and see if our chat room out does us tonight in the angst.

1915
02:45:19,980 --> 02:45:21,140
We will have a look here.

1916
02:45:21,140 --> 02:45:24,540
Misty says,

1917
02:45:24,540 --> 02:45:28,340
F the weather in St. Louis right now. There either needs to be enough snow for

1918
02:45:28,340 --> 02:45:30,180
a decent ass snowball war,

1919
02:45:30,180 --> 02:45:34,020
or none at all, because I actually want to take driving lessons now.

1920
02:45:34,020 --> 02:45:40,020
Dark Night says, okay F you to crazy weather and work, more to come.

1921
02:45:40,020 --> 02:45:43,020
And F you to my PS2 about to kick the bucket soon.

1922
02:45:43,020 --> 02:45:47,020
Dark Tetsuya says F you to the crappy weather coming back from Washington.

1923
02:45:47,020 --> 02:45:51,020
Our flight was delayed due to freezing rain in Seattle.

1924
02:45:51,020 --> 02:45:56,020
MPQ says F you to Sonic commercials, not the hedgehog but the burger chain I imagine.

1925
02:45:56,020 --> 02:45:59,020
Every time I see their commercials I think, oh man I want that.

1926
02:45:59,020 --> 02:46:02,020
But wait, there aren't any around here.

1927
02:46:02,020 --> 02:46:03,540
You know what, we have the same problem.

1928
02:46:03,540 --> 02:46:08,660
They advertise Sonic all the time in Sacramento, and the nearest one is an hour drive away.

1929
02:46:08,660 --> 02:46:09,660
Go figure.

1930
02:46:09,660 --> 02:46:10,660
There's a Sonic in Yuba City.

1931
02:46:10,660 --> 02:46:11,660
That's the closest one.

1932
02:46:11,660 --> 02:46:12,660
Oh.

1933
02:46:12,660 --> 02:46:17,140
When I lived in the Bay Area, that's all we got was Sonic commercials, and at least in

1934
02:46:17,140 --> 02:46:21,620
the area that I was living in, we didn't even have one, so yeah.

1935
02:46:21,620 --> 02:46:23,140
Yeah.

1936
02:46:23,140 --> 02:46:24,140
So we hear you there.

1937
02:46:24,140 --> 02:46:29,600
Also, F you to my parents insisting on using AOL, even though we have cable internet.

1938
02:46:29,600 --> 02:46:30,740
That coming from MPQ.

1939
02:46:30,740 --> 02:46:31,900
I'm canceling mine.

1940
02:46:31,900 --> 02:46:39,300
Uh, VXJ6V says F you once again to my manager. F you, F you, F you. That's all.

1941
02:46:39,300 --> 02:46:42,020
Phoenix says

1942
02:46:42,020 --> 02:46:44,340
F you to DarkSakura for booting me.

1943
02:46:44,340 --> 02:46:47,100
Haha, only kidding.

1944
02:46:47,100 --> 02:46:51,180
It's a damn good thing he put that only kidding thing in there, huh?

1945
02:46:51,180 --> 02:46:54,820
No it's not. She's going to work.

1946
02:46:54,820 --> 02:46:57,620
F you to the weather getting cold for tomorrow

1947
02:46:57,620 --> 02:47:02,660
when I have to march, Meh.

1948
02:47:02,660 --> 02:47:05,980
And he also says he apolog- that was him that called in and he apologizes for his

1949
02:47:05,980 --> 02:47:10,340
ma- uh, microphone screwing up.

1950
02:47:10,340 --> 02:47:12,460
DJ Ron Mez says,

1951
02:47:12,460 --> 02:47:17,940
First, F you to myself for not finding my PS2 game and my mem card. Second, F you to

1952
02:47:17,940 --> 02:47:21,580
my ex-roommate for flipping me off and threatening me again. That shit will get

1953
02:47:21,580 --> 02:47:27,140
you fired. Or have you forgotten that we work for the same company, you redneck?

1954
02:47:27,140 --> 02:47:34,140
Jaded2005 says, F you to Mad Catz Pads cause I almost killed myself on one last night.

1955
02:47:34,140 --> 02:47:35,640
That's no fun.

1956
02:47:35,640 --> 02:47:40,420
TheBigRedPimp, Ohio Bamani says, F you to the lack of a Chinese food restaurant in my

1957
02:47:40,420 --> 02:47:45,020
back ass town.

1958
02:47:45,020 --> 02:47:50,020
Dork says, one word, girls.

1959
02:47:50,020 --> 02:47:54,020
Now I don't know if he means the song or girls in general.

1960
02:47:54,020 --> 02:47:55,020
You be the judge.

1961
02:47:55,020 --> 02:48:03,020
SSJ100Matt says, FU of the Week, General Grievous slash Derek not holding up his end of the deal.

1962
02:48:03,020 --> 02:48:07,020
FU leaving hometown New York City to go back to school in Phoenix.

1963
02:48:07,020 --> 02:48:12,020
DarkSakura, oh it's Samir.

1964
02:48:12,020 --> 02:48:14,020
Hi DarkSakura!

02:48:14,020 --> 02:48:16,020

02:48:16,020 --> 02:48:17,020
I forgot, you sent that on behalf of a friend.

1967
02:48:17,020 --> 02:48:19,020
And it comes from EarthDragononix.

anything it doesn't matter you don't deserve anything in this life no one

02:56:22,480 --> 02:56:28,080
funnier than Joey so you know tune in anything is funnier than Joey right so

2020
02:56:28,080 --> 02:56:33,760
that's that and the light is funnier than Joey uh what else is there there's

2021
02:56:33,760 --> 02:56:38,360
There's umm, whatever you're doing.

2022
02:56:38,360 --> 02:56:39,360
Well that's Thursdays.

2023
02:56:39,360 --> 02:56:40,360
Mondays, Diversion.

2024
02:56:40,360 --> 02:56:41,360
Diversion.

2025
02:56:41,360 --> 02:56:42,840
And then Fridays over on The Freak.

2026
02:56:42,840 --> 02:56:46,080
Wednesdays we have the oldie and moldy orange launch radio reruns.

2027
02:56:46,080 --> 02:56:47,080
They're still around.

2028
02:56:47,080 --> 02:56:49,600
We've got to get some new episodes up in there so I'll try to shuffle that around.

2029
02:56:49,600 --> 02:56:53,120
I know we're going to have new music coming to Bomani Music & More this week.

2030
02:56:53,120 --> 02:56:59,240
We've got some of the songs from Fusion, some new 2DX11 songs, some of the secret songs.

2031
02:56:59,240 --> 02:57:01,480
I got some copies of those, we're going to put those in there too because there's some

2032
02:57:01,480 --> 02:57:02,480
awesome songs in there.

2033
02:57:02,480 --> 02:57:04,480
What is the secret song?

2034
02:57:04,480 --> 02:57:07,480
There's a new Ryu song and a new Slake song and I like them both.

2035
02:57:07,480 --> 02:57:09,480
What's the boss song for 2DX?

2036
02:57:09,480 --> 02:57:11,480
God, I don't remember.

2037
02:57:13,480 --> 02:57:18,480
I just got called out and I lost big time. Oh well, what can you do?

2038
02:57:21,480 --> 02:57:25,480
Let's see. I guess that's it. Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

2039
02:57:25,480 --> 02:57:29,480
We'll start it off with explicit. Since you were the tardiest, you have to go first.

2040
02:57:29,480 --> 02:57:31,480
Your final thought.

2041
02:57:31,480 --> 02:57:33,480
Being late sucks.

2042
02:57:33,480 --> 02:57:38,480
There you go. Being the second tardiest, Angel gets her final thought.

2043
02:57:39,480 --> 02:57:42,480
Need more game. Oh wait, I have school this week. Shit.

2044
02:57:43,480 --> 02:57:48,480
Arcadian, being prompt. Thank you. You get your final thought.

2045
02:57:48,480 --> 02:57:52,480
I hope I get broadband soon. Very soon, hopefully.

2046
02:57:52,480 --> 02:57:56,480
And Loki, having the least amount of seniority, you get your final thought.

2047
02:57:56,480 --> 02:57:58,480
Tomorrow's gonna be fun.

2048
02:57:58,480 --> 02:58:03,980
And my final thought is, I'm going to give Jamie her final thought.

2049
02:58:03,980 --> 02:58:07,380
Jamie, your final thought.

2050
02:58:07,380 --> 02:58:11,680
My final thought is, well, my lap's pretty warm from this laptop.

2051
02:58:11,680 --> 02:58:15,280
Alright.

2052
02:58:15,280 --> 02:58:18,580
Go outside and do something, people!

2053
02:58:18,580 --> 02:58:23,840
Except unless we're broadcasting. The final word of the show I'm going to give to MrQuiet

2054
02:58:23,840 --> 02:58:28,880
Arcadian 42, because he's got to say something, dammit. One word to sum it all up.

2055
02:58:28,880 --> 02:58:32,880
Leprechauns!

2056
02:58:32,880 --> 02:58:36,240

And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

2061
02:59:21,880 --> 02:59:25,880
It's always busy when I try to call

2062
02:59:26,880 --> 02:59:30,880
Mouse keeps clickin' till my hand's turnin' blue

2063
02:59:30,880 --> 02:59:34,880
You know I'm tryin' to phone ya, but my modem won't go through

2064
02:59:34,880 --> 02:59:38,880
Got a research paper due at school

2065
02:59:38,880 --> 02:59:42,880
Some dirty pictures would be awfully cool

2066
02:59:43,880 --> 02:59:47,880
I'm emailin' grandma, she's a hundred and two

2067
02:59:47,880 --> 02:59:50,280
But now I'm sad to inform ya

2068
02:59:50,280 --> 02:59:52,480
Granddad's message won't close through

2069
02:59:52,480 --> 02:59:56,480
Wanna surf but I can hardly roll

2070
02:59:56,480 --> 03:00:01,280
The U.S. Postal Service ain't this slow

2071
03:00:01,280 --> 03:00:05,080
I told AOL that I was totally screwed

2072
03:00:05,080 --> 03:00:07,480
They said we're sorry we boned ya

2073
03:00:07,480 --> 03:00:09,480
But there's nothing we can do

2074
03:00:37,480 --> 03:00:46,360
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2075
03:01:07,480 --> 03:01:33,480
All right, guys.

Sakura?

2080
03:01:47,080 --> 03:01:48,080
Uh, it's fire.

2081
03:01:48,080 --> 03:01:54,200
Loki? Uh, no. I don't have anything. See ya! Don't forget about our podcast, by the way,
