[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, go ahead.

16:40.597 --> 16:43.759

[SPEAKER_01]: Did he used to play football when he was in high school?

[SPEAKER_09]: Well, actually, no, he didn't.

17:00.298 --> 17:02.159
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what do you think of Intern Zero?

17:02.599 --> 17:05.981
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to really remember the pill, alright?

17:06.461 --> 17:08.442
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm seeing some forgetting, possibly.

17:08.742 --> 17:11.663
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm seeing a new baby in the next three months.

17:12.425 --> 17:12.825
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

17:13.125 --> 17:16.026
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, well, thanks for being on Orange Lounge Radio today.

17:16.186 --> 17:21.228
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't mean to sidetrack your question here, but who are all of these nosy people?

17:21.488 --> 17:24.789
[SPEAKER_01]: Outside influences I'm seeing around you by the moon card.

17:24.989 --> 17:25.910
[SPEAKER_43]: Get away from me.

17:28.431 --> 17:33.252
[SPEAKER_43]: Orange Lounge Radio, helping to free your mind and spirit.

[SPEAKER_01]: I love you.

[SPEAKER_09]: We're here, of course, every Sunday night for you guys.

17:49.107 --> 17:51.288
[SPEAKER_09]: 6.30 Pacific Standard Time to 9.30 Pacific Standard Time.

17:51.468 --> 17:56.670
[SPEAKER_09]: All that discussion on rhythm and music, video gaming, and video games that don't suck.

17:57.450 --> 17:57.950
[SPEAKER_09]: And some that do.

18:00.111 --> 18:02.732
[SPEAKER_09]: Join us in our chat room, www.OrangeLawnTrader.com.

18:02.752 --> 18:03.473
[SPEAKER_09]: Click on chat.

18:04.373 --> 18:05.994
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever happened to Intern Zero, by the way?

18:07.194 --> 18:11.496
[SPEAKER_19]: I know a whole bunch of crap about him that I'm not at liberty to speak of.

18:12.217 --> 18:13.579
[SPEAKER_19]: But it involves legal action.

18:13.779 --> 18:14.840
[SPEAKER_09]: Make up your own story.

18:15.861 --> 18:17.062
[SPEAKER_09]: That could be a contest, maybe.

18:17.102 --> 18:17.843
[SPEAKER_09]: Write your fanfic.

18:17.923 --> 18:18.444
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, maybe not.

18:19.024 --> 18:21.227
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

18:22.488 --> 18:32.018
[SPEAKER_07]: He was abducted by aliens and went up with Richard Dreyfuss, and then they flew away while Steven Spielberg got rich.

18:33.599 --> 18:34.420
[SPEAKER_44]: Yes, that's it.

18:35.259 --> 18:40.402
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, usually we start off the show playing a little bit of how was your week, how was your day, and we're going to get into that in a little bit.

18:40.462 --> 18:43.924
[SPEAKER_09]: However, I did want to kind of make an exception tonight for this.

18:45.164 --> 18:49.667
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie and I were talking about this a little bit before tonight's show and we thought we wanted to take a minute to acknowledge this.

18:50.285 --> 19:16.662
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have had the television on at all today, I'm sure you've heard about this, so we're probably not the first ones to break this news to you, but Johnny Carson, you know, the late night guy that was on for many, many, many years, he passed away today, and we just wanted to take a minute to kind of offer up a moment of silence, because I don't know about you guys, but for me, I think Johnny Carson is an inspiration to any sort of talk program ever.

19:16.762 --> 19:18.603
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the guy was absolutely hilarious.

19:18.663 --> 19:19.604
[SPEAKER_09]: He was a comic genius.

19:20.409 --> 19:26.173
[SPEAKER_09]: So many people on his show, so many careers of celebrities that we know today got started all thanks to his help.

19:26.673 --> 19:31.036
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just want to take a minute to acknowledge Mr. Johnny Carson.

19:31.577 --> 19:32.537
[SPEAKER_09]: A moment of silence, please.

19:37.261 --> 19:38.061
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, thank you very much.

19:39.222 --> 19:40.323
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything you want to add to that, Jamie?

19:41.323 --> 19:43.285
[SPEAKER_19]: I remember that weird curtain he had.

19:44.445 --> 19:47.888
[SPEAKER_19]: I remember the curtain reappearing in Mallrats.

19:48.988 --> 19:49.909
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember Ed McMahon.

19:51.459 --> 19:52.520
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

20:24.904 --> 20:27.765
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very little bit cold outside, isn't it?

20:29.266 --> 20:31.887
[SPEAKER_19]: Excuse me for a second.

20:31.927 --> 20:37.309
[SPEAKER_09]: Just so you guys know what's going on, we're just... Oh, say hello, Mr. Man, who just picked up the microphone, who's getting glomped right now.

20:37.810 --> 20:42.852
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, yeah, it's... Yeah, that guy called Floatwalk, and he's got something to say later.

20:43.592 --> 20:44.673
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay, all right.

20:45.513 --> 20:45.673
[SPEAKER_09]: And?

20:45.953 --> 20:48.014
[SPEAKER_16]: And his faithful traveling companion, Sharkskrull.

20:48.074 --> 20:49.254
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, Sharkskrull.

20:49.315 --> 20:50.195
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, how are you?

20:50.215 --> 20:50.315
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello!

20:51.239 --> 20:52.540
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello, I have presents for you.

20:52.560 --> 20:54.142
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for making me feel special.

20:54.162 --> 21:00.067
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta let DarkSakura finish her thought that she was starting with.

21:14.426 --> 21:19.791
[SPEAKER_19]: My week was, well, it started off really good because I started my new position at work on Tuesday.

21:20.431 --> 21:24.434
[SPEAKER_19]: Making more money, doing cooler stuff, and not talking to people on the phone.

21:25.816 --> 21:32.061
[SPEAKER_19]: And then as of Wednesday, I was single for about most of the day.

21:33.522 --> 21:35.283
[SPEAKER_19]: As Lynn literally dumped that day.

21:36.825 --> 21:37.025
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

21:37.045 --> 21:37.125
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

21:38.292 --> 21:40.013
[SPEAKER_19]: and things have since been repaired.

21:41.754 --> 21:50.558
[SPEAKER_19]: Although it's been a very, very, I'm not, of course, it's nobody's real business what happened, but I've been very much on edge for this entire week.

21:51.799 --> 21:55.100
[SPEAKER_19]: And today has been the first good day of my entire week.

22:00.243 --> 22:00.543
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just,

22:04.794 --> 22:05.754
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not really going to go into it.

22:05.794 --> 22:06.975
[SPEAKER_19]: It was really, really hard.

22:08.335 --> 22:08.795
[SPEAKER_09]: It's personal.

22:08.835 --> 22:09.195
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fine.

22:09.835 --> 22:17.177
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, but that's really been the entire focus of my week, although I've played a whole crapload of Castlevania today.

22:19.038 --> 22:19.378
[SPEAKER_09]: Which one?

22:19.818 --> 22:20.498
[SPEAKER_19]: Symphony of the Night.

22:20.818 --> 22:21.118
[SPEAKER_09]: Right on.

22:22.778 --> 22:29.640
[SPEAKER_19]: And I had two class orientations, spent $118 on art supplies, and I still need to buy another 60 more.

22:30.440 --> 22:31.020
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeez.

22:31.400 --> 22:32.461
[SPEAKER_19]: What kind of class is this for?

22:33.321 --> 22:33.381
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh,

22:33.999 --> 22:35.020
[SPEAKER_19]: Concept of art design.

22:37.763 --> 22:41.487
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I have to buy paint next, like watercolors and crap.

22:43.088 --> 22:47.232
[SPEAKER_19]: So, that's really it for this week.

22:48.073 --> 22:49.214
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's why I'm full of angst.

22:49.935 --> 22:50.616
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, well.

22:50.656 --> 22:54.820
[SPEAKER_19]: However, I have rediscovered the joys of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches made with pineapple jelly.

22:55.706 --> 22:56.727
[SPEAKER_09]: I figured you'd like the picture.

23:19.781 --> 23:20.762
[SPEAKER_09]: I rejoined that too.

23:44.884 --> 23:46.104
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh.

23:46.445 --> 23:46.785
[SPEAKER_07]: Addict!

23:47.105 --> 23:47.425
[SPEAKER_07]: Addict!

23:48.045 --> 23:48.866
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you're not an addict.

23:48.986 --> 23:49.546
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, sure.

23:49.606 --> 23:50.846
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll cover that later.

23:51.246 --> 23:52.127
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm not an addict.

23:52.907 --> 24:03.231
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, then I was working on the Orange Box at the moment, and for those who don't know what the Orange Box is, that's the Xbox case that's going to have a PC in it.

24:04.271 --> 24:11.514
[SPEAKER_07]: And I spent lots of time dremeling today, and now the case is, you know, kind of a,

24:12.814 --> 24:15.135
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

24:37.240 --> 24:38.520
[SPEAKER_07]: That will be replacing it.

24:38.880 --> 24:46.602
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know why I need a 160 gig hard drive considering that this... I don't really know what the hell I'm going to put on it.

24:46.722 --> 24:47.122
[SPEAKER_07]: ROMs.

24:47.362 --> 24:49.622
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't think I can fit 160 gigs of ROMs.

24:49.662 --> 24:50.542
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a lot.

24:52.743 --> 24:54.723
[SPEAKER_07]: And then... What else?

24:54.863 --> 24:54.963
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh!

24:55.683 --> 24:58.764
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than that, I had a migraine yesterday and that was lots of fun.

24:59.144 --> 25:04.165
[SPEAKER_07]: And then... No, that's pretty much it.

25:06.185 --> 25:06.345
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

25:08.826 --> 25:13.288
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I did not plan how to rape Robin in the sleep, but there was a sketch... What?

25:14.568 --> 25:14.828
[SPEAKER_26]: What?

25:15.128 --> 25:18.450
[SPEAKER_07]: But Nellie said she would try for $100, but she... $50.

25:19.450 --> 25:32.235
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to ask, because I was sitting here the other night, we were all sitting around, and Nellie, who is Loki's other half, was just coming up with all these random hypothetical questions, and they all had to do with raping me.

25:35.359 --> 25:38.080
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, we're going to get that kid named Jagermeister eventually.

25:40.901 --> 25:42.162
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you rape him in a boat?

25:42.242 --> 25:43.563
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you rape him on a float?

25:43.683 --> 25:45.123
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you rape him near or far?

25:45.183 --> 25:46.304
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you rape him in a car?

25:47.444 --> 25:51.886
[SPEAKER_20]: But it would be really easy to rape you in your sleep because you sleep a lot on the couch on your back.

25:52.687 --> 26:00.530
[SPEAKER_20]: And since 70% of male sleep is spent with an erection, I was thinking I'd just sneak up on him and pull his pants down.

26:01.070 --> 26:04.192
[SPEAKER_20]: And insertion equals rape, so that's like an easy 50 bucks.

26:05.856 --> 26:08.378
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but the minute you sit on me, I'm going to go, Ah!

26:09.279 --> 26:11.220
[SPEAKER_20]: It's in already, so it doesn't matter.

26:12.081 --> 26:12.922
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my God.

26:14.143 --> 26:15.284
[SPEAKER_09]: You're a sick woman.

26:15.304 --> 26:20.548
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to steal my... This is the first time we've gotten Nellie to really talk on this show, and it's about raping me.

26:23.551 --> 26:24.651
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what I do best.

26:25.232 --> 26:29.876
[SPEAKER_09]: Then she's sitting around trying to get Loki, Would you rape Rob for a million dollars?

26:31.017 --> 26:33.759
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you rape Rob for a hundred thousand dollars?

26:35.370 --> 26:36.651
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you rape him for 20 bucks?

26:37.052 --> 26:37.552
[SPEAKER_09]: And a smile.

26:37.572 --> 26:39.494
[SPEAKER_09]: I love her.

26:39.554 --> 26:41.156
[SPEAKER_19]: Would you rape Rob for a Klondike bar?

26:43.899 --> 26:45.480
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, Klondike bar.

26:46.201 --> 26:49.264
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Klondike bars, but no, no, no.

26:53.909 --> 26:56.531
[SPEAKER_09]: Now the chat room is having their own rhyming contest here.

26:56.811 --> 26:58.413
[SPEAKER_09]: OrangeLawnsRadio.com, click on chat.

26:58.713 --> 26:59.254
[SPEAKER_09]: Now blaze.

26:59.850 --> 27:02.731
[SPEAKER_09]: about me for a question for Loki here.

27:02.971 --> 27:04.351
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you rape him in the face?

27:04.591 --> 27:05.792
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you rape him anyplace?

27:10.313 --> 27:12.734
[SPEAKER_09]: Somewhere, Dr. Seuss is crying.

27:12.834 --> 27:14.435
[SPEAKER_20]: But I offered to split the money with you.

27:15.655 --> 27:16.015
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, gee.

27:16.035 --> 27:19.476
[SPEAKER_20]: That's why it's $100, because I was going to give $50 to you.

27:19.516 --> 27:19.716
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

27:20.857 --> 27:21.237
[SPEAKER_09]: Never mind.

27:21.297 --> 27:23.817
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to get technical and ask, technically, what is rape?

27:23.837 --> 27:24.978
[SPEAKER_09]: Does oral sex count as rape?

27:25.098 --> 27:25.258
No.

27:26.038 --> 27:26.298
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

27:27.879 --> 27:28.899
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, move on.

27:29.511 --> 27:32.374
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on to non-raping subjects, at least I hope.

27:32.894 --> 27:33.875
[SPEAKER_09]: Mel B, how was your week?

27:33.915 --> 27:34.495
[SPEAKER_09]: How was your day?

27:35.536 --> 27:36.257
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, dear.

27:36.957 --> 27:41.421
[SPEAKER_35]: Week was a lot of monotony, but then again, when you're working in video games, you wait.

27:41.461 --> 27:42.742
[SPEAKER_35]: That's really how it goes.

27:43.383 --> 27:46.906
[SPEAKER_35]: For those who may or may not know, I actually did not work at Konami at the time.

27:50.229 --> 27:51.450
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay, just reading these lines.

27:51.490 --> 27:51.830
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

27:51.990 --> 27:53.772
[SPEAKER_10]: Chat room, stop being funny.

27:54.132 --> 27:54.492
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop.

27:55.694 --> 27:57.375
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop being... Okay, I'll say it.

27:58.130 --> 28:02.672
[SPEAKER_09]: For those that are not into chat, Blaze, the comic genius of Blaze again.

28:02.992 --> 28:04.412
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you rape him in the ear?

28:04.552 --> 28:05.813
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you rape him for a beer?

28:09.554 --> 28:10.894
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you rape him like a duck?

28:11.015 --> 28:12.095
[SPEAKER_09]: Would anyone give a fuck?

28:12.955 --> 28:14.496
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you rape him for five bucks?

28:14.556 --> 28:15.496
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you rape him like a duck?

28:16.116 --> 28:17.117
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, jeez, forget it.

28:17.317 --> 28:18.377
[SPEAKER_09]: Chat room, stop being funny.

28:18.637 --> 28:18.957
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop.

28:19.718 --> 28:20.078
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop.

28:21.698 --> 28:22.058
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, Mel.

28:22.579 --> 28:26.620
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah, I'm actually, instead of being at Konami right now, I'm actually working at Namco.

28:27.276 --> 28:34.899
[SPEAKER_35]: of all places, which means it's a lot of Pac-Man and Pac-Man and Tekken 5.

28:36.179 --> 28:38.180
[SPEAKER_35]: But it's just kind of going along.

28:38.220 --> 28:38.620
[SPEAKER_35]: It's a job.

28:38.640 --> 28:40.681
[SPEAKER_35]: Everything is kind of interesting.

28:41.021 --> 28:47.944
[SPEAKER_35]: And of course, as with any place I go to, there's that one person who watches me play either DDO or 2DX at work.

28:48.004 --> 28:50.965
[SPEAKER_35]: I usually bring my stuff on break and play user debug stations.

28:51.065 --> 28:51.145
[SPEAKER_35]: And

28:52.043 --> 28:54.284
[SPEAKER_35]: They say, wow, did you work at Konami or test this game?

28:54.324 --> 28:57.225
[SPEAKER_35]: Like, I didn't test this game, but, you know, I played before and stuff.

28:57.465 --> 28:58.846
[SPEAKER_35]: Like, wow, you must feel like DDR, too.

28:58.866 --> 29:00.907
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm like, yeah, I played, you know, I played DDR for a couple years.

29:00.927 --> 29:03.888
[SPEAKER_35]: And he goes, wait a minute, weren't you at that first Metreon tournament?

29:03.928 --> 29:04.749
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm like, yeah.

29:04.969 --> 29:06.009
[SPEAKER_35]: Wait a minute, what's your name again?

29:06.489 --> 29:06.970
[SPEAKER_35]: Uh, Mel.

29:07.290 --> 29:10.151
[SPEAKER_35]: They're like, no way, you're not Mel B. I'm like, yeah.

29:10.471 --> 29:11.812
[SPEAKER_35]: Like, dude, let me see your name badge.

29:11.992 --> 29:14.113
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm like, this is at work?

29:14.553 --> 29:15.273
[SPEAKER_35]: This is at work.

29:16.114 --> 29:21.496
[SPEAKER_35]: Here, guys, like, other testers come up to me and, like, know me through this stuff and... Don't you...

29:22.176 --> 29:24.538
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have time to be fraternizing on your breaks.

29:24.678 --> 29:28.681
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't there a new Katamari Damacy game to be testing and Tekken 5 and all that stuff?

29:29.002 --> 29:30.443
[SPEAKER_35]: That'll be later this year.

29:31.784 --> 29:32.364
[SPEAKER_35]: How it goes.

29:32.845 --> 29:36.047
[SPEAKER_35]: But yeah, we have all sorts of goodies over there right now.

29:36.087 --> 29:38.269
[SPEAKER_35]: We get to see a lot of PSP action out there, actually.

29:38.429 --> 29:39.130
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, very hot.

29:39.370 --> 29:41.992
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah, so those things look pretty sexy, I must say.

29:42.092 --> 29:43.613
[SPEAKER_35]: They look a lot better than what I remember at E3.

29:43.633 --> 29:44.894
[SPEAKER_35]: I remember that much.

29:45.835 --> 29:47.957
[SPEAKER_09]: Is Namco going to be putting anything out on the DS?

29:48.677 --> 29:50.419
[SPEAKER_09]: Because damn, the DS needs some games.

29:51.159 --> 29:51.620
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes, there is.

29:52.298 --> 29:53.519
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, the Pac-Pix thing.

29:53.919 --> 29:54.159
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course.

29:54.359 --> 29:57.140
[SPEAKER_09]: Namco has to whore Pac-Man wherever they can.

29:57.781 --> 29:58.101
[SPEAKER_35]: Mm-hmm.

29:58.501 --> 30:12.107
[SPEAKER_35]: I mean, yeah, basically, the two main sounds you hear out of Namco are waka-waka and... Seriously, that's just what I feel like when I walk around the whole... When you walk around the Namco building, do you actually do a... Do they have dots on the floor?

30:18.447 --> 30:25.793
[SPEAKER_35]: I think in one of the old rooms, because they just moved buildings, but at the old building, yes, there was a room that actually had, like, a Pac-Man mic.

30:26.154 --> 30:29.737
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, at Namco, can you have drag days, and you just all come to work with a bow in your hair?

30:32.339 --> 30:37.904
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, man, they just instituted a dress code out there, so we can't even, like, you know, come in our normal does.

30:37.924 --> 30:40.806
[SPEAKER_35]: We gotta have, like, collared shirts, and we gotta be all prim and proper.

30:41.567 --> 30:45.190
[SPEAKER_09]: I would, so, if I worked at Namco, thank God I don't, because they couldn't handle me.

30:45.558 --> 30:50.321
[SPEAKER_09]: But if I were Dinamco, man, I'd come to work with a bow in my hair one day and be all, yes, I miss Roberts.

30:54.304 --> 30:55.004
[SPEAKER_35]: Forget it.

30:55.385 --> 30:57.386
[SPEAKER_35]: So, yeah, just getting used to the new gig.

30:57.486 --> 30:58.467
[SPEAKER_35]: It's, you know, pretty cool.

30:58.807 --> 31:03.830
[SPEAKER_35]: Although, you know, after playing a fighting game for eight hours straight, it can be tiresome.

31:04.010 --> 31:09.194
[SPEAKER_35]: Or, you know, when they do something genius like have me play a two-player mode all by myself for eight hours.

31:09.314 --> 31:11.115
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I was reading about that in the LJ.

31:11.175 --> 31:11.856
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up with that?

31:11.876 --> 31:13.617
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't know, man.

31:13.717 --> 31:14.978
[SPEAKER_35]: They're just geniuses out there.

31:14.998 --> 31:15.418
[SPEAKER_35]: What can I say?

31:15.945 --> 31:23.767
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I've played two-player versus in fighting games by myself before, but that was, like, to see all the fatalities in Mortal Kombat, okay?

31:23.847 --> 31:24.067
[SPEAKER_35]: Right.

31:24.187 --> 31:27.227
[SPEAKER_35]: I mean, if I want to do something like that, just put me on practice mode.

31:27.267 --> 31:30.488
[SPEAKER_35]: At least there's some kind of, you know, indicator of what you're doing in there.

31:30.508 --> 31:35.689
[SPEAKER_35]: You can actually, like, practice stuff in practice mode, but if you play versus, it's kind of pointless.

31:36.869 --> 31:38.430
[SPEAKER_35]: But, yeah, for that.

31:38.450 --> 31:40.550
[SPEAKER_35]: And then the weekend's been pretty, you know, chill.

31:40.570 --> 31:44.331
[SPEAKER_35]: I mean, yesterday was a pretty horrible day because I was going to go to work,

31:45.323 --> 31:47.124
[SPEAKER_35]: I wake up and I realize I can't find my car keys.

31:47.164 --> 31:49.005
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm like, hmm, what could be going on?

31:49.565 --> 31:50.986
[SPEAKER_35]: And so I'm just kind of worried.

31:51.006 --> 31:53.167
[SPEAKER_35]: So I start turning my place upside down and I don't find it.

31:53.667 --> 31:56.188
[SPEAKER_35]: And I couldn't find my phone because it was locked in my car.

31:56.688 --> 32:01.610
[SPEAKER_35]: And so, you know, my phone was in my car and I didn't have my car keys.

32:02.031 --> 32:03.411
[SPEAKER_35]: And so I'm just like really tripping.

32:03.511 --> 32:07.433
[SPEAKER_35]: And then, so I don't know how to, you know, contact anyone or anything.

32:07.553 --> 32:11.675
[SPEAKER_35]: And it's like, first I didn't want to, you know, tell anyone.

32:12.536 --> 32:16.118
[SPEAKER_35]: Sharks girl over here because she knows I'm like the most forgetful person in the world.

32:16.438 --> 32:20.159
[SPEAKER_35]: Last thing I needed was more, you know, fuel for her fire and etc.

32:20.660 --> 32:25.742
[SPEAKER_35]: And then it kind of got to the point where I just kind of said, okay, screw it.

32:25.762 --> 32:29.083
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm just going to call mobile locksmith and yeah, I'm just going to bite the bullet, etc.

32:29.563 --> 32:31.284
[SPEAKER_35]: And so what happens is I called a locksmith and

32:32.094 --> 32:59.405
[SPEAKER_35]: he comes on over and he pops my door open and it was going to cost about like damn near 300 bucks to get a new key because I have like a computer chip in my key that's you know certain to the Camaro series of that year and right when he pops my door open my cell phone goes off and it starts going and she calls me and says hey I just found your keys right now in my handbag I'm like no way so it was all about impeccable timing that night but I was on edge pretty much that rest of the day and

33:00.239 --> 33:06.043
[SPEAKER_35]: Everything else has been pretty chill and today's been just coming up here and of course Orange Lounge is where I be.

33:07.564 --> 33:09.565
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, and Pixie?

33:13.547 --> 33:22.953
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, to say the least, I spent the majority of my week on vacation in Hayward doing butt-ass nothing, driving a truck all day long.

33:24.134 --> 33:29.177
[SPEAKER_13]: And, let's see, came back on Thursday night in like dense-ass fog.

33:30.697 --> 33:31.157
[SPEAKER_13]: What else do we do?

33:31.658 --> 33:32.378
[SPEAKER_13]: What else do we do?

33:34.120 --> 33:35.461
[SPEAKER_13]: Stop bringing goddamn books!

33:36.502 --> 33:36.902
[SPEAKER_13]: Bitch!

33:38.783 --> 33:40.024
[SPEAKER_13]: Now he won't talk to me.

33:40.044 --> 33:40.925
[SPEAKER_13]: But anyways, yeah.

33:41.025 --> 33:41.646
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that the new one?

33:43.287 --> 33:43.867
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that the new one?

33:44.107 --> 33:46.169
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the one with the Chains of Prometheus stuff in it?

33:47.490 --> 33:48.311
I'm sorry.

33:48.891 --> 33:49.552
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I had that one.

33:49.612 --> 33:49.912
[SPEAKER_07]: Never mind.

33:50.172 --> 33:51.033
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, anyways, continue.

33:52.834 --> 33:54.295
[SPEAKER_19]: And, let's see, Saturday.

33:54.315 --> 33:57.358
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I've been boring.

33:57.378 --> 33:58.839
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't been here very often.

33:59.622 --> 34:00.423
Alright Frank, give it to Victor.

34:07.248 --> 34:08.168
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm right here.

34:09.730 --> 34:14.693
[SPEAKER_13]: Buy me a bottle of Jager and give me five bucks in five minutes.

34:17.235 --> 34:19.016
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, Rob, you can open your gift now.

34:19.457 --> 34:21.418
[SPEAKER_13]: This was Angel's idea to get this.

34:21.758 --> 34:22.379
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes it was.

34:22.739 --> 34:27.182
[SPEAKER_13]: So I could redeem myself because I flaked twice on you when I said I was going to come by.

34:27.763 --> 34:29.204
[SPEAKER_13]: But you have to read the card first.

34:31.926 --> 34:32.867
[SPEAKER_09]: I love GIFs.

34:33.007 --> 34:33.707
[SPEAKER_09]: This is great.

34:33.787 --> 34:36.488
[SPEAKER_09]: I think every week should be Bring Sky GIFs Week on Orange Lounge.

34:36.709 --> 34:38.870
[SPEAKER_18]: Next week will be Bring Sky GIFs Day.

34:39.010 --> 34:42.191
[SPEAKER_19]: I was like, it wasn't my... Yeah, it was her idea.

34:42.291 --> 34:43.072
[SPEAKER_19]: She spotted it.

34:43.372 --> 34:43.872
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, fine.

34:43.892 --> 34:46.674
[SPEAKER_18]: Where's the card?

34:46.714 --> 34:47.514
[SPEAKER_13]: Where's the card?

34:47.934 --> 34:49.335
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, go through the double wrap.

34:50.356 --> 34:52.757
[SPEAKER_13]: The double ghetto wrap that I call Winko Plastic Bag.

34:52.777 --> 34:53.677
[SPEAKER_09]: I love present time.

34:54.758 --> 34:55.879
[SPEAKER_09]: Aw, it's kisses.

34:55.979 --> 34:57.239
[SPEAKER_09]: It has a little pig on it.

34:57.259 --> 34:58.360
[SPEAKER_09]: It says, kiss you.

35:00.572 --> 35:01.593
[SPEAKER_09]: Make me squeal.

35:01.753 --> 35:05.236
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it says inside, it says, Will you marry me?

35:07.057 --> 35:08.458
[SPEAKER_09]: Janae just proposed to me.

35:09.119 --> 35:09.379
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

35:09.519 --> 35:10.900
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, bitch, I'll marry you.

35:10.920 --> 35:14.143
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, your ring's in the bag, too.

35:14.243 --> 35:16.144
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, your ring's in the bag.

35:16.164 --> 35:17.265
[SPEAKER_13]: Your ring's in the bag, too.

35:19.947 --> 35:20.748
[SPEAKER_26]: What the shit?

35:24.091 --> 35:24.231
[SPEAKER_10]: It's...

35:25.231 --> 35:27.454
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a rainbow dessert parfait.

35:27.975 --> 35:28.335
[SPEAKER_09]: Get it?

35:28.556 --> 35:29.897
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'm a big fag?

35:30.378 --> 35:31.219
[SPEAKER_09]: It's rainbow?

35:34.564 --> 35:36.226
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll go put this on cam.

35:38.529 --> 35:39.871
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's shaped like a hole.

35:43.490 --> 35:44.731
[SPEAKER_05]: A bag of mayonnaise.

35:46.532 --> 35:47.873
[SPEAKER_05]: What the fuck, lady?

35:49.614 --> 35:51.415
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't mean it with a bag of mayonnaise.

35:51.435 --> 35:57.639
[SPEAKER_13]: That was for my sandwich.

35:57.739 --> 35:59.040
[SPEAKER_05]: I will remember this forever.

35:59.380 --> 36:08.466
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go with my mom and say, Mama, I got proposed to with a bag of mayonnaise and a Froot Loop.

36:11.118 --> 36:13.799
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought $2 would be enough to spend on you, you know?

36:19.482 --> 36:22.043
[SPEAKER_19]: Other than Frozen and Rob, that's been my week.

36:23.384 --> 36:23.744
Victor?

36:24.965 --> 36:27.166
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, my week, or the week before, which was more exciting.

36:27.226 --> 36:27.806
[SPEAKER_32]: Actually, just kidding.

36:27.846 --> 36:29.667
[SPEAKER_32]: This week was fun with my girlfriend.

36:29.687 --> 36:30.828
[SPEAKER_32]: We had a lot of sex!

36:31.328 --> 36:32.749
[SPEAKER_32]: No, we had no sex.

36:32.769 --> 36:34.529
[SPEAKER_32]: What the hell is that tuna smell?

36:36.590 --> 36:38.171
[SPEAKER_32]: Sorry, I had a sandwich in there.

36:38.691 --> 36:39.692
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, ugh.

36:41.035 --> 36:45.916
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, anyways, playing Final Fantasy Online and Rank 6.

36:47.617 --> 36:50.917
[SPEAKER_32]: Have a whole bunch of plus one gear and leaping lizards and all that crap.

36:51.918 --> 36:56.739
[SPEAKER_32]: Other than that, this week with my girlfriend was exciting.

36:57.399 --> 36:57.879
[SPEAKER_32]: I loved it.

36:58.679 --> 36:59.099
[SPEAKER_32]: And that was it.

37:00.940 --> 37:01.120
[SPEAKER_42]: Aww.

37:01.640 --> 37:05.621
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, by the way, you can double the ring mold as something to put your dick in.

37:07.721 --> 37:08.422
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, my God.

37:12.725 --> 37:12.965
[SPEAKER_26]: You.

37:20.008 --> 37:21.108
[SPEAKER_07]: It's safe sex.

37:23.609 --> 37:25.710
[SPEAKER_07]: That mayonnaise does not have a spermicide in it.

37:29.871 --> 37:31.032
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the new microphones.

37:31.512 --> 37:33.853
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I can't wait to go fuck my new rainbow pussy.

37:33.893 --> 37:34.793
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so excited.

37:38.515 --> 37:38.855
[SPEAKER_09]: Bitch.

37:41.773 --> 37:42.914
[SPEAKER_38]: I love you!

37:44.815 --> 37:48.458
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just too hardcore for G4 TV, that's why we'd never be on there.

37:52.560 --> 37:53.201
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, anyways.

37:54.862 --> 37:58.845
[SPEAKER_09]: Our chat room is so lost right now because they're not getting half these references, but that's alright.

37:59.685 --> 38:01.566
[SPEAKER_09]: NoStylin, were you done talking about your week and your day?

38:03.748 --> 38:04.208
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm rank 6.

38:04.428 --> 38:05.829
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you waving your hand in the air?

38:06.109 --> 38:07.430
[SPEAKER_09]: Waving it like you just don't care?

38:08.831 --> 38:11.393
[SPEAKER_07]: You might get those girls parapairing.

38:13.366 --> 38:14.726
[SPEAKER_09]: You got ranked 6th on Final Fantasy.

38:14.746 --> 38:16.407
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so proud of you.

38:16.447 --> 38:17.947
[SPEAKER_09]: Your internet penis is huge!

38:20.048 --> 38:22.269
[SPEAKER_32]: I have 90 days playing Acquired.

38:22.349 --> 38:24.050
[SPEAKER_32]: I have wasted my life.

38:24.410 --> 38:24.770
[SPEAKER_32]: Jamie?

38:26.511 --> 38:26.931
[SPEAKER_09]: If you would.

38:27.411 --> 38:27.691
[SPEAKER_19]: Addict?

38:30.832 --> 38:32.373
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what?

38:33.233 --> 38:37.195
[SPEAKER_19]: I plan on addicting myself because Ragnarok Online 2 is not yet out.

38:38.194 --> 38:42.655
[SPEAKER_19]: and I need something to play because I miss Ragnarok so much but I'm so pissed off at Gravity right now.

38:43.716 --> 38:49.858
[SPEAKER_19]: I actually spent a whole ten minutes on Final Fantasy XI yesterday waiting on Rob.

38:53.499 --> 38:53.819
[SPEAKER_44]: Alright.

38:57.740 --> 38:58.480
[SPEAKER_09]: Shark Skrull.

38:59.540 --> 39:02.761
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, I had to revel in the moment there about Jamie actually playing Final Fantasy XI.

39:02.801 --> 39:03.902
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to think about it for a minute.

39:05.422 --> 39:06.242
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, you're done now.

39:06.322 --> 39:06.963
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, Shark Skrull.

39:07.143 --> 39:07.583
[SPEAKER_09]: How was your week?

39:07.603 --> 39:07.983
[SPEAKER_09]: How was your day?

39:08.393 --> 39:09.053
[SPEAKER_16]: That'd be awesome.

39:37.199 --> 39:44.781
[SPEAKER_07]: that would be kind of a different change I forgot to mention I had big news my job well

39:46.109 --> 40:11.746
[SPEAKER_07]: technically it's not been announced yet but since no one really listens to the station anyways of any importance I thought I would go ahead and mention it well our company has decided to get back into the games business so now they're going to be doing game distribution and I've been told by the CEO and by my boss that I'll be a part of it somehow but you have to rape them I do not have to rape them

40:16.801 --> 40:18.142
[SPEAKER_07]: Rape them at a medium pace.

40:19.923 --> 40:21.344
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to rape them at the mall.

40:21.404 --> 40:22.545
[SPEAKER_09]: Then you have to rape them all.

40:23.506 --> 40:23.786
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

40:23.806 --> 40:26.748
[SPEAKER_19]: Why do you rape them for a PSP?

40:26.808 --> 40:32.552
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like this slogan they used to have for the mall back in Mobile.

40:32.973 --> 40:35.574
[SPEAKER_19]: It was, you know, shop the mall, shop them all.

40:36.315 --> 40:38.116
[SPEAKER_19]: It's rape the mall, rape them all.

40:38.997 --> 40:40.358
[SPEAKER_19]: Gotta rape them all.

40:43.180 --> 40:44.040
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyways...

40:45.649 --> 40:47.250
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, remember that word, piss?

40:47.350 --> 40:49.071
[SPEAKER_07]: How funny that was last week?

40:49.512 --> 40:49.952
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

40:52.093 --> 41:03.721
[SPEAKER_07]: No, so anyways, games... We're going to be getting in the games business, so that means I can get an E3 using VPD now, and also hopefully get some free demos.

41:04.942 --> 41:05.682
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, demos!

41:08.304 --> 41:11.606
[SPEAKER_09]: SharkStroll, were you done with your thought before Loki so rudely interrupted you?

41:12.587 --> 41:14.148
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm boring this week, so...

41:20.821 --> 41:26.725
[SPEAKER_16]: I interviewed for the job I'm at now on Monday on the phone.

41:26.825 --> 41:28.807
[SPEAKER_16]: I interviewed in person on Wednesday at 9.

41:28.907 --> 41:31.789
[SPEAKER_16]: I found out I had the job at 1 and got in a car accident at 1.20.

41:32.149 --> 41:38.654
[SPEAKER_16]: You have this insane luck with car accidents when you do new exciting things.

41:38.674 --> 41:41.636
[SPEAKER_16]: $1,584 to fix a bumper and a back quarter panel.

41:42.136 --> 41:43.077
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crap.

41:43.657 --> 41:44.658
[SPEAKER_16]: That sucks.

41:45.354 --> 41:47.595
[SPEAKER_16]: Luckily, my insurance covered all but $250 of it.

41:48.215 --> 41:48.795
[SPEAKER_16]: That's decent.

41:49.115 --> 41:57.978
[SPEAKER_16]: And I might get $125 back if I can convince Geico that because I'm backing out doesn't mean that I have a greater duty of care to watch that I don't hit him considering he was backing out too.

41:59.119 --> 41:59.939
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't get that one.

42:00.339 --> 42:01.840
[SPEAKER_16]: Why it's more my fault, but okay.

42:03.340 --> 42:04.320
[SPEAKER_20]: Because you're a woman.

42:04.340 --> 42:04.921
[SPEAKER_20]: What, Nellie?

42:04.981 --> 42:05.901
[SPEAKER_20]: Because you're a woman.

42:07.762 --> 42:10.463
[SPEAKER_07]: Which proves the point that women can't drive.

42:11.323 --> 42:11.803
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop.

42:12.427 --> 42:15.908
[SPEAKER_16]: I have some really nice videotapes I could throw at your head right now.

42:15.968 --> 42:18.309
[SPEAKER_16]: They're nice and heavy.

42:18.970 --> 42:19.170
[SPEAKER_16]: That's hot.

42:19.190 --> 42:19.590
[SPEAKER_16]: Flavor Flav!

42:19.630 --> 42:19.910
[SPEAKER_09]: Flavor Flav!

42:38.035 --> 42:46.881
[SPEAKER_16]: Flava Flav, and Dave Coulee, and Brigitte Nielsen, and Charo, and Brian Starr.

42:47.561 --> 42:50.083
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, and Jordan Knight.

42:50.583 --> 42:50.963
Whatever.

42:51.544 --> 42:52.004
[SPEAKER_09]: What else is there?

42:52.084 --> 42:55.326
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, so you've been doing nothing but playing on your sidekick at work this week.

42:55.346 --> 42:55.706
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, pretty much.

42:56.107 --> 42:57.367
[SPEAKER_09]: Does Snoop do his own laundry?

42:57.888 --> 42:58.048
[SPEAKER_08]: Huh?

42:58.268 --> 42:59.549
[SPEAKER_09]: Does Snoop do his own laundry?

43:00.489 --> 43:01.030
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

43:03.051 --> 43:03.311
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

43:03.391 --> 43:04.152
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you have a comment?

43:04.672 --> 43:05.873
[SPEAKER_09]: Or are you just waving at the camera?

43:05.993 --> 43:06.473
[SPEAKER_09]: No styling?

43:06.493 --> 43:07.514
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

43:07.987 --> 43:13.350
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to see the webcam, www.orangeonstrider.com Moving on, it's my turn, dammit!

43:14.151 --> 43:16.152
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to take a turn, I know we still got Angel left to go.

43:16.212 --> 43:16.893
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on, bitch!

43:17.433 --> 43:19.754
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got something to say!

43:19.894 --> 43:20.955
[SPEAKER_13]: I've got something to say!

43:21.115 --> 43:23.957
[SPEAKER_13]: My boyfriend's retarded, so don't look at him on the camera, please.

43:24.337 --> 43:25.158
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't encourage him.

43:26.058 --> 43:29.861
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, my week and my day was okay.

43:30.061 --> 43:32.542
[SPEAKER_09]: I did a whole lot of nothing this week, really.

43:32.562 --> 43:35.004
[SPEAKER_09]: I played a lot of Final Fantasy XI, just like, you know, my...

43:35.970 --> 43:37.711
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

43:53.412 --> 43:55.595
[SPEAKER_09]: and you guys know what a freaking lightweight I am.

43:55.635 --> 43:57.518
[SPEAKER_09]: You've heard the drunk shows we've done on Orange Islands Radio.

43:57.718 --> 44:02.825
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how I was able to hold down that many shots without completely passing.

44:02.885 --> 44:07.911
[SPEAKER_09]: I did eventually pass out, but I was quite proud of myself considering I hadn't drank in a long time.

44:08.012 --> 44:08.953
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Pixie Dust.

44:10.123 --> 44:15.467
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, did you pass out and they put a funnel in your mouth and then they shot the shot down for you?

44:15.747 --> 44:19.190
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I kept going... You were always falling asleep on the floor.

44:19.210 --> 44:21.971
[SPEAKER_19]: I fell asleep on the floor like three times in my house.

44:22.052 --> 44:23.753
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody was doing shots together.

44:23.913 --> 44:26.575
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just the biggest pussy with the lowest alcohol tolerance.

44:27.295 --> 44:28.916
[SPEAKER_09]: And so everybody else was still coherent.

44:28.936 --> 44:33.640
[SPEAKER_09]: But then I'd be kind of like slumping on the table going, I need to cut myself off.

44:33.900 --> 44:37.142
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they'll put another one in front of me and I'll be all, okay, drink it.

44:37.222 --> 44:37.523
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

44:46.983 --> 44:51.166
[SPEAKER_09]: No, thankfully Pixie Dust was not at the party, so nobody was putting makeup on me and making me look pretty.

44:51.366 --> 44:57.610
[SPEAKER_16]: At least you weren't like Verne Troyer in the first episode of Surreal Life Season 4, because he was naked and pissing in the corner of the weight room.

44:57.730 --> 45:06.937
[SPEAKER_16]: I was, however, going, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

45:09.238 --> 45:11.780
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, enough talking about VH1 shows.

45:13.066 --> 45:18.070
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at that, they're sitting there in the chat room right now, and one of my buddies that was there last night says, yeah, we shaved his ass.

45:20.151 --> 45:20.452
[SPEAKER_09]: Huh.

45:21.012 --> 45:21.492
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

45:21.613 --> 45:22.894
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I check it this morning?

45:24.795 --> 45:26.616
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to come inspect it, Pacey Dust?

45:27.497 --> 45:29.238
[SPEAKER_09]: Get the flashlight, it's pretty cavernous.

45:29.619 --> 45:29.899
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

45:31.280 --> 45:33.282
[SPEAKER_09]: DDR Angel, last but certainly not least.

45:33.302 --> 45:34.142
[SPEAKER_09]: How was your week, how was your day?

45:35.403 --> 45:36.084
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, let's see.

45:36.524 --> 45:42.909
[SPEAKER_19]: Classes started this week, and normally I'd probably be going, uh, but

45:43.729 --> 45:47.852
[SPEAKER_19]: No, actually, scarily enough, I enjoyed myself this week.

45:48.533 --> 45:49.514
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a little scary.

45:49.594 --> 45:51.075
[SPEAKER_19]: School being enjoyable.

45:52.075 --> 45:53.497
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, anyway.

45:54.497 --> 46:04.365
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, yeah, other than that, uh, just like everyone else, Final Fantasy XI, Jamie, waiting, waiting, waiting.

46:06.141 --> 46:07.102
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not going to say it anymore.

46:07.362 --> 46:09.423
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

46:09.803 --> 46:13.625
[SPEAKER_19]: And actually, I actually split myself between three games now.

46:13.826 --> 46:19.949
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's now Final Fantasy XI there, and I've gotten back into Myst.

46:20.269 --> 46:20.670
[SPEAKER_19]: Help.

46:22.050 --> 46:23.071
[SPEAKER_19]: Ah, Myst.

46:23.511 --> 46:25.372
[SPEAKER_19]: Nobody cares about that in this area.

46:25.813 --> 46:28.134
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't Myst like 15 years old, that game?

46:28.194 --> 46:29.615
[SPEAKER_09]: It's older than God.

46:30.069 --> 46:37.312
[SPEAKER_19]: Of course, but I had to start... I'm not going to comment that I have it for Saturn.

46:38.372 --> 46:39.272
[SPEAKER_19]: Cool.

46:40.293 --> 46:57.338
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I never got to really get to play that game, so they came out with a DVD version a little while back, so I have all three of those, the first three in the series, and then I got the Complete Chronicles, which is like a little offshoot of the...

47:00.106 --> 47:05.889
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I have too many games to play and school to deal with.

47:07.750 --> 47:08.190
[SPEAKER_19]: That's okay.

47:08.350 --> 47:09.311
[SPEAKER_19]: Final Fantasy XI tomorrow.

47:09.451 --> 47:09.671
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

47:10.731 --> 47:11.151
[SPEAKER_32]: Or tonight.

47:11.572 --> 47:12.552
[SPEAKER_32]: I beat it last week.

47:14.433 --> 47:15.534
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't beat Final Fantasy XI.

47:15.574 --> 47:16.094
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, you can.

47:16.114 --> 47:17.394
[SPEAKER_32]: The original Final Fantasy XI.

47:17.414 --> 47:18.475
[SPEAKER_32]: You can beat the storyline.

47:18.515 --> 47:19.435
[SPEAKER_32]: I played the storyline.

47:19.475 --> 47:20.216
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay, okay.

47:20.276 --> 47:20.756
[SPEAKER_09]: That was fun.

47:21.597 --> 47:21.977
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotcha.

47:26.719 --> 47:27.159
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on.

47:27.179 --> 47:28.140
[SPEAKER_09]: They can't hear you, dear.

47:28.160 --> 47:28.680
[SPEAKER_09]: They can't hear you.

47:29.352 --> 47:32.934
[SPEAKER_19]: I spent it laying on the bed watching my boyfriend play Final Fantasy XI.

47:33.194 --> 47:35.175
[SPEAKER_19]: How depressing is that?

47:37.497 --> 47:38.757
[SPEAKER_19]: For my vacation.

47:38.857 --> 47:39.918
[SPEAKER_09]: Were you at least giving him head?

47:39.938 --> 47:43.880
[SPEAKER_13]: The majority of my vacation was sucked into Final Fantasy XI.

47:44.180 --> 47:45.581
[SPEAKER_09]: Were you giving him head while he was doing it?

47:46.021 --> 47:47.122
[SPEAKER_13]: Nah, the table's too small.

47:47.222 --> 47:48.443
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, whoa, hey.

47:48.483 --> 47:49.143
[SPEAKER_09]: Ho, ho, ho.

47:49.183 --> 47:49.704
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

47:49.724 --> 47:49.984
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

47:50.064 --> 47:50.384
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

47:50.504 --> 47:50.924
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

47:51.104 --> 47:51.304
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

47:51.365 --> 47:51.625
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

47:58.235 --> 48:00.777
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on, we're going to go to a break, I think.

48:00.897 --> 48:08.583
[SPEAKER_09]: And in this break, now when we were in that last break there, the chat room was starting to go, you guys play these songs all the time.

48:08.683 --> 48:11.525
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't you play some songs we don't ever hear?

48:11.805 --> 48:12.886
[SPEAKER_09]: What's wrong with you guys?

48:13.046 --> 48:14.047
[SPEAKER_09]: Play some new songs.

48:14.508 --> 48:14.748
[SPEAKER_09]: Fine.

48:15.128 --> 48:23.034
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm digging into the obscure stuff, the stuff we don't really play a whole lot, and I'm going to try and play some new stuff that we don't play on Orange Launch Radio a whole lot.

48:24.744 --> 48:26.905
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, but see, we play that one a bit.

48:27.366 --> 48:31.708
[SPEAKER_09]: I can do that in a later break, but I gotta do stuff that jumps out at me saying we don't really play this.

48:31.728 --> 48:34.250
[SPEAKER_19]: Dig into the bowels of 2DX Substream.

48:34.650 --> 48:42.315
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna dig into the bowels here, but what I have queued up right now, I have the bonus stage from the newest Taiko no Tatooine in Japan.

48:42.375 --> 48:44.956
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I know we've never played that one, because Navi just sent it to me this week.

48:45.376 --> 48:45.857
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called...

48:46.437 --> 49:12.510
[SPEAKER_09]: Koi Bumi 2000, we're going to play that and then we have from 2DX Red, I know a lot of folks have heard this but we haven't played this song on Orange Lounge Radio and it has the word fuck in it, so I have to play it, so listen carefully but it goes, you have to listen carefully because it goes, fuck me and it's called Injection of Love and then we're going to play something, I'm going to play some like old ass 5 key song as well so we will be back after this

49:13.203 --> 49:17.772
[SPEAKER_09]: with some rare music stuff, and we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio after this.

49:37.743 --> 49:38.184
[SPEAKER_26]: DarkSakura

49:54.284 --> 49:55.365
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you for watching!

50:39.364 --> 50:40.428
Thanks for watching!

51:56.301 --> 51:57.462
Thank you for watching!

52:46.677 --> 52:47.326
DarkSakura

53:31.858 --> 53:33.278
Thanks for watching!

54:32.907 --> 54:43.573
[SPEAKER_26]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio and oh my lord, there's a gazillion people in the house now.

54:53.729 --> 55:02.731
[SPEAKER_09]: I think somewhere during that break, Explicit showed up, and RicePrincess and LankyStyle from Thursday Nights Outside the Box showed up as well.

55:03.391 --> 55:05.291
[SPEAKER_09]: Holy crap, there's a lot of people here.

55:05.931 --> 55:10.012
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess we might as well continue with the how was your week, how was your day bit real fast for the people that just got here.

55:12.233 --> 55:13.513
[SPEAKER_09]: LankyStyle, how was your week, how was your day?

55:14.813 --> 55:19.414
[SPEAKER_02]: Same as always, just work, slaved over the phone, working for the devil.

55:21.075 --> 55:21.575
[SPEAKER_09]: I hear that.

55:21.835 --> 55:23.556
[SPEAKER_09]: Rice Princess, how was your week, how was your day?

55:24.896 --> 55:25.797
[SPEAKER_09]: She just said pretty good.

55:27.898 --> 55:28.378
[SPEAKER_09]: Explicit?

55:31.239 --> 55:31.939
[SPEAKER_31]: It's pretty good.

55:32.519 --> 55:40.062
[SPEAKER_31]: Just getting some more replies with Determine and actually I'm sending applications on PI for those who cannot pre-register online and stuff.

55:41.183 --> 55:44.564
[SPEAKER_31]: And just got off of CCL to see what new arcades they have gotten.

55:45.820 --> 55:47.941
[SPEAKER_31]: Of course, everyone knows they have 6th style there.

55:48.901 --> 55:53.382
[SPEAKER_31]: And they're replacing one of the DDR machines with the In The Groove machine.

55:53.402 --> 55:54.002
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, what?

55:54.162 --> 55:54.362
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

55:55.222 --> 55:56.542
[SPEAKER_09]: They have 6th style at CCL?

55:57.382 --> 55:59.383
[SPEAKER_31]: No, it's just B-Mania 3.

55:59.723 --> 56:00.223
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, B-Mania 3.

56:00.503 --> 56:01.283
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'd heard about that.

56:01.583 --> 56:02.263
[SPEAKER_31]: Not 2DX.

56:03.284 --> 56:03.584
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

56:04.384 --> 56:04.804
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotcha.

56:04.964 --> 56:06.804
[SPEAKER_31]: You know how crowded that's going to be in CCL.

56:09.305 --> 56:09.625
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

56:11.005 --> 56:12.746
[SPEAKER_31]: The rest will be held in my FUs.

56:12.926 --> 56:13.646
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, goody, goody.

56:13.906 --> 56:14.206
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

56:15.017 --> 56:15.397
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on.

56:16.157 --> 56:16.797
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, guys.

56:16.857 --> 56:18.578
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what can I say in studio here?

56:18.658 --> 56:19.778
[SPEAKER_09]: There's, what, like 11 people here?

56:19.838 --> 56:20.578
[SPEAKER_09]: Pull up a floor.

56:22.898 --> 56:24.599
[SPEAKER_09]: Please try not to fart in studio.

56:24.639 --> 56:25.919
[SPEAKER_09]: We'd appreciate that.

56:27.639 --> 56:28.139
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on.

56:28.259 --> 56:34.921
[SPEAKER_09]: I noticed Loki's over on our webcam there at www.orangeentrader.com and he's holding up pieces of this modified Xbox.

56:35.241 --> 56:41.922
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell us, for the listeners that haven't heard about what you're doing here with this Xbox, tell us about this little project that you've picked up, Loki, about modifying an Xbox.

56:42.611 --> 56:43.292
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

56:58.419 --> 57:18.506
[SPEAKER_07]: No, um, usually they're fanless, but this one being a 1 gigahertz processor is not fanless, but they're really fucking small, so you're, you know, able to put them in the really small, um, cases, like the Xbox case here, so it's actually gonna have, the way I have it working right now is it's actually gonna run all off a battery.

57:19.656 --> 57:21.457
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's going to be 100% portable.

57:21.577 --> 57:30.023
[SPEAKER_07]: For a monitor, I'm actually using a portable PlayStation PS1 LCD screen that's 5 inches.

57:31.724 --> 57:32.945
[SPEAKER_07]: All going to be portable, though.

57:33.165 --> 57:33.585
[SPEAKER_07]: Completely 100%.

57:33.685 --> 57:36.167
[SPEAKER_07]: Nerd!

57:37.388 --> 57:44.793
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, it's us four, so we can, you know, do our, you know, Orange Lounge Radio To Go editions from the road, from E3.

57:46.286 --> 57:46.426
[SPEAKER_09]: Nerds!

58:09.454 --> 58:13.158
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, I'm pictochatting with someone sitting right next to me.

58:14.200 --> 58:14.520
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

58:14.700 --> 58:17.183
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd be playing DS2, but I left it at my buddy's house.

58:17.463 --> 58:18.404
[SPEAKER_09]: Whoops, in my jacket.

58:18.485 --> 58:19.145
[SPEAKER_32]: Shame on you.

58:22.449 --> 58:22.950
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well.

58:23.691 --> 58:24.051
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, um...

58:25.780 --> 58:29.323
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to get to some actual DDR news, you guys.

58:29.984 --> 58:33.967
[SPEAKER_09]: Actual news about a really big rhythm music game going on right now.

58:34.688 --> 58:41.414
[SPEAKER_09]: As we talked about a couple weeks ago, there's going to be a brand new DDR game coming out on the GameCube, and it's called DDR with Mario.

58:42.255 --> 58:50.342
[SPEAKER_09]: And we knew that we were going to be getting some more information on this game after the Tokyo, what was it, the Tokyo Hobby Fair or something like that that just took place very recently?

58:51.583 --> 58:52.343
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I screw up the name?

58:52.404 --> 58:52.744
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably.

58:53.459 --> 59:00.242
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyway, this Tokyo Fair just happened, and not only did we get a lot more information about this game, we got videos.

59:00.945 --> 59:10.713
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to show some videos in studio right now, and for those of you on stream, I know this makes for really great radio, but for those of you on stream, you can actually listen to this over the stream.

59:10.733 --> 59:17.239
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be playing this for you guys, and what's really cool is that you can actually hear some of the music that's going to be in DDR Mario through this.

59:17.619 --> 59:24.185
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to play this, and this first video should be a song that you guys really recognize, at least I hope so.

59:25.860 --> 59:36.228
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you want to check out these videos for yourself, just head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on the news story that we posted earlier about this.

59:37.950 --> 59:39.451
[SPEAKER_19]: By the way, thank Dan for those.

59:40.172 --> 59:40.892
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, did he find those?

59:41.032 --> 59:42.413
[SPEAKER_19]: Dan found those for me last night.

59:42.774 --> 59:43.214
[SPEAKER_09]: Very nice.

59:44.155 --> 59:51.761
[SPEAKER_19]: By the way, if anybody happens to have an IGN Insider account, please let us know because we need your assistance.

59:52.842 --> 59:53.182
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

59:53.587 --> 59:57.631
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, here's one video, and listen carefully for the song that's playing in the background.

59:57.691 --> 59:58.752
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds very familiar.

01:00:14.393 --> 01:00:15.454
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:00:56.210 --> 01:00:57.711
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I want to point this out in the video.

01:00:57.731 --> 01:00:59.252
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me turn this down a little bit.

01:00:59.592 --> 01:01:00.793
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you guys can hear the song.

01:01:01.354 --> 01:01:05.998
[SPEAKER_09]: In the video, you'll notice that some of the arrows are actually pictures of Boo.

01:01:06.638 --> 01:01:07.239
[SPEAKER_09]: The little Boo.

01:01:08.192 --> 01:01:13.976
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you step on that, it makes this giant ghost appear on your opponent's side that blocks the arrows.

01:01:14.496 --> 01:01:17.078
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're incorporating some of the Versus Mode stuff in it.

01:01:25.944 --> 01:01:30.366
[SPEAKER_09]: Very interesting there, because you notice that the DDR Max announcer was in that.

01:01:30.887 --> 01:01:31.567
[SPEAKER_09]: Perfect!

01:01:31.887 --> 01:01:32.768
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, all that stuff.

01:01:33.448 --> 01:01:36.630
[SPEAKER_09]: Very... I don't know if it's Thomas Howard, I don't know.

01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:37.111
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

01:01:37.191 --> 01:01:37.471
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

01:01:38.455 --> 01:01:42.416
[SPEAKER_09]: The lady's voice in the background, we think, is just at the show.

01:01:42.476 --> 01:01:43.857
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't think it's actually a part of the game.

01:01:43.897 --> 01:01:44.997
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, she's just a part of the show.

01:01:45.437 --> 01:01:48.078
[SPEAKER_09]: But you could probably hear it in the background, that medley that's playing.

01:01:48.358 --> 01:01:50.419
[SPEAKER_09]: You knew that this would happen in a DDR Mario game.

01:01:50.459 --> 01:01:51.819
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a dance version of the Mario Bros.

01:01:51.839 --> 01:01:51.939
[SPEAKER_09]: theme.

01:01:51.959 --> 01:01:54.920
[SPEAKER_09]: From Super Mario 2, or USA, first stage.

01:02:01.226 --> 01:02:02.608
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, so very interesting there.

01:02:02.989 --> 01:02:05.111
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, this next one is very interesting.

01:02:05.152 --> 01:02:07.495
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to show you this one, the last clip.

01:02:07.535 --> 01:02:08.396
[SPEAKER_09]: It's clip number four.

01:02:08.817 --> 01:02:12.642
[SPEAKER_09]: This is one of my favorites because they actually have Mario and Luigi dancing in it.

01:02:13.022 --> 01:02:15.546
[SPEAKER_09]: But this will allow you to hear one of the other songs that's in the game.

01:02:16.187 --> 01:02:16.627
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um...

01:02:17.469 --> 01:02:25.331
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to get a little hint of the gameplay, because you'll notice the arrows aren't only just replaced with the boos, but they also have the Goombas and the Koopa Troopas.

01:02:25.771 --> 01:02:26.512
[SPEAKER_09]: Very interesting.

01:02:26.572 --> 01:02:27.812
[SPEAKER_09]: Very Nintendo-fied, this game.

01:02:27.832 --> 01:02:29.432
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to talk about it a little more here in a minute.

01:02:29.913 --> 01:02:38.915
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me get this other clip queued up here, and we'll watch it in studio, and you guys can hear a clip of the song that's going to be in DDR with Mario. ...

01:02:46.229 --> 01:02:50.516
[SPEAKER_09]: and in this video they have para para girls doing a routine to the song

01:03:09.318 --> 01:03:13.881
[SPEAKER_09]: And they have girls paraparrying to a basic song on DDR Mario here.

01:03:20.506 --> 01:03:24.749
[SPEAKER_09]: And male DDR fans everywhere have a new masturbatory video to watch.

01:03:27.010 --> 01:03:29.032
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to point out though, look how Mario dances.

01:03:31.130 --> 01:03:31.891
[SPEAKER_26]: Look at Luigi!

01:03:32.011 --> 01:03:32.771
[SPEAKER_26]: He's making waves!

01:03:32.811 --> 01:03:33.592
[SPEAKER_26]: He's doing the Watusi!

01:03:33.612 --> 01:03:35.553
[SPEAKER_26]: See, there's a Koopa Troopa that just went up.

01:03:52.791 --> 01:03:55.172
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm rather impressed that they can patapata in there too

01:04:21.815 --> 01:04:22.976
[SPEAKER_09]: Very interesting.

01:04:23.876 --> 01:04:30.601
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I realize you guys at home listening right now can't really see what we're watching, but you can get the videos on the website.

01:04:30.641 --> 01:04:36.785
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got to be interesting also to hear the songs there, but what do you guys think now that you've seen a little bit of DDR Mario in action?

01:04:36.985 --> 01:04:40.188
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on, let me tell you guys a little bit more information about this game going on.

01:04:40.888 --> 01:04:49.434
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, what's going on is that they only were able to check out a demo version, of course, naturally, at the Tokyo...

01:04:52.709 --> 01:04:54.265
[SPEAKER_09]: The World Hobby Fair, that's it.

01:04:54.751 --> 01:04:55.511
[SPEAKER_09]: The World Hobby Fair.

01:04:55.531 --> 01:04:58.692
[SPEAKER_09]: They were only able to have a little mini version of the game.

01:04:58.732 --> 01:05:00.233
[SPEAKER_09]: And here's what the mini version featured.

01:05:00.693 --> 01:05:03.474
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that it kind of featured only the two-player mode.

01:05:03.734 --> 01:05:06.295
[SPEAKER_09]: And Mario and Luigi were the only playable characters in it.

01:05:06.595 --> 01:05:08.435
[SPEAKER_09]: And there were only about seven songs.

01:05:08.735 --> 01:05:12.877
[SPEAKER_09]: And it does talk about that Goomba and Koopa show up as special icons.

01:05:13.237 --> 01:05:17.578
[SPEAKER_09]: When you see a Goomba icon, if you tap the appropriate space on the dance pad, it smashes it.

01:05:17.918 --> 01:05:21.999
[SPEAKER_09]: If you smash a Koopa twice, you'll send it flying back down the column.

01:05:22.099 --> 01:05:23.640
[SPEAKER_09]: And it'll knock out all the other arrows.

01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:24.640
[SPEAKER_09]: in the column.

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:29.781
[SPEAKER_09]: So they've come up with all these interesting little, very Nintendo-like things.

01:05:29.801 --> 01:05:33.622
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the boo, if you step on the boo, it makes the ghost bigger on the other side and it hides the arrows.

01:05:33.882 --> 01:05:36.202
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, of course, there's a little picture of the dance mat here.

01:05:37.843 --> 01:05:38.803
[SPEAKER_09]: Very interesting.

01:05:40.503 --> 01:05:46.284
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to head on over to DDR Freak because I know on the thread there over DDR Freak they were talking about some of the songs that are actually going to be in it.

01:05:46.524 --> 01:05:49.165
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, you heard there the song from Super Mario Bros.

01:05:49.205 --> 01:05:50.405
[SPEAKER_09]: Part 2, Stage 1 in it.

01:05:51.388 --> 01:05:53.089
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you guys think after seeing some of those videos?

01:05:53.149 --> 01:05:55.190
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, you were the one that showed me these videos in the first place.

01:05:55.210 --> 01:05:55.631
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think?

01:05:56.371 --> 01:05:57.472
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's adorable.

01:05:59.013 --> 01:06:02.435
[SPEAKER_19]: I just think it's cool watching them do the cute little dances and turning around.

01:06:02.695 --> 01:06:03.475
[SPEAKER_19]: And then the big boo.

01:06:04.136 --> 01:06:04.936
[SPEAKER_19]: It had the big boo.

01:06:05.237 --> 01:06:06.377
[SPEAKER_19]: And I love the big boo.

01:06:08.639 --> 01:06:12.501
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm quoting from a post here from Unknown Gamer over on DDR Freak.

01:06:12.541 --> 01:06:15.343
[SPEAKER_09]: It's post number 202 in the GameCube DDR thread.

01:06:15.723 --> 01:06:18.024
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're saying some of the songs that they've translated...

01:06:19.432 --> 01:06:23.913
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see, we have Here We Go from Super Mario Bros., Hoppin' Choppin' from Super Mario Bros.

01:06:24.013 --> 01:06:28.775
[SPEAKER_09]: USA, and then look at this, Para Para Carmen, like the opera Carmen.

01:06:29.355 --> 01:06:29.715
[SPEAKER_09]: That's wrong.

01:06:29.735 --> 01:06:30.736
[SPEAKER_09]: A Para Para version.

01:06:31.316 --> 01:06:37.158
[SPEAKER_09]: Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Mozart in the Pipe, Then Go the You, A Small Night's Music.

01:06:37.798 --> 01:06:40.079
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the name of the song, Then Go the Pipe.

01:06:42.879 --> 01:06:47.641
[SPEAKER_09]: Credit there to Unknown Gamer over at DDR Freak for translating some of those and putting them in a post there.

01:06:48.374 --> 01:06:50.155
[SPEAKER_09]: You know my thoughts on this?

01:06:50.315 --> 01:06:51.055
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'll get to my thoughts.

01:06:51.075 --> 01:06:51.815
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to hear you guys.

01:06:51.835 --> 01:06:52.395
[SPEAKER_09]: I've talked enough.

01:06:53.196 --> 01:06:56.557
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to know if there's going to be a mushroom icon.

01:06:56.577 --> 01:07:00.038
[SPEAKER_02]: If you step on that, it gives a hallucinogenic effect to the other player or something.

01:07:02.859 --> 01:07:05.500
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole game seems like a big hallucinogenic effect.

01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:08.501
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what would you expect, though, from this?

01:07:08.641 --> 01:07:10.121
[SPEAKER_09]: DDR with Mario, honestly.

01:07:13.603 --> 01:07:13.863
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

01:07:14.763 --> 01:07:14.883
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

01:07:15.296 --> 01:07:16.436
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it looks fun.

01:07:16.796 --> 01:07:22.658
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it'd be interesting to, I think mainly the big thing for me is just the music, you know, see what they're going to do with the Nintendo tunes.

01:07:24.478 --> 01:07:28.539
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they should have a secret, like, other Nintendo characters thing in there too, though.

01:07:28.579 --> 01:07:32.200
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, you got Samus, and you get Samus music.

01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:35.661
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude, the Samus shuffle, I don't know.

01:07:38.482 --> 01:07:40.682
[SPEAKER_09]: The Morph Ball slide, I don't know.

01:07:41.383 --> 01:07:42.763
[SPEAKER_09]: How about Mel, Mel B?

01:07:44.191 --> 01:07:44.772
[SPEAKER_35]: Um, gosh.

01:07:44.812 --> 01:07:46.933
[SPEAKER_09]: You gotta admit, that Power Par Freestyle was pretty hot.

01:07:47.513 --> 01:07:55.178
[SPEAKER_35]: Um, yeah, I must say, it reinforces my belief that, pretty much, Power Par is a female thing, and it only looks good that way.

01:07:56.219 --> 01:08:00.662
[SPEAKER_35]: But, um, that said, I mean, looking at the gameplay and stuff, it reminds me a lot of basically just...

01:08:01.252 --> 01:08:04.335
[SPEAKER_35]: Disney Rave Magic on Crack, which, you know, is a cool thing.

01:08:04.415 --> 01:08:10.019
[SPEAKER_35]: It's like one of those concepts that Ultramix 2, you know, kind of tried to do with its battle mode and like other gimmicks.

01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:14.783
[SPEAKER_35]: This one kind of takes into a more, I guess, recognizable form, which is kind of cool.

01:08:15.464 --> 01:08:27.594
[SPEAKER_35]: It's kind of neat to see the music that seems to hear, you know, what I heard as far as music-wise, but hypothetically, if this comes out, say, you know, to a stateside release, I can't see it doing a whole lot better, you know.

01:08:27.834 --> 01:08:28.435
[SPEAKER_35]: It's sort of like

01:08:29.096 --> 01:08:30.177
[SPEAKER_35]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.911
[SPEAKER_35]: DDR Ultramix 1

01:09:13.362 --> 01:09:14.022
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so other comments?

01:09:14.062 --> 01:09:14.182
[SPEAKER_09]: Angel.

01:09:14.202 --> 01:09:16.403
[SPEAKER_09]: It does have potential, though, so you never know.

01:09:41.576 --> 01:09:43.337
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I thought it was really cool.

01:09:43.457 --> 01:09:46.438
[SPEAKER_19]: I would probably be one of those people to be like, oh, I'm still getting that.

01:09:47.178 --> 01:09:50.320
[SPEAKER_19]: Just because it's DDR and it's cute and whatever.

01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:53.921
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you say one of the songs called Mozart on the Pipe?

01:09:54.282 --> 01:09:55.382
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like that.

01:09:55.402 --> 01:09:56.763
[SPEAKER_02]: Stoner DDR is right, yeah.

01:09:57.543 --> 01:09:59.364
[SPEAKER_35]: I didn't know Mary and Barry was Mozart.

01:10:01.945 --> 01:10:05.386
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other thoughts from those of you guys on the couch or over at Sharks Girl?

01:10:05.426 --> 01:10:06.387
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know anybody.

01:10:07.067 --> 01:10:08.788
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to pick up DDR Mario Sharks Girl?

01:10:08.808 --> 01:10:08.848
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

01:10:10.572 --> 01:10:12.113
[SPEAKER_09]: What is it about this game that looks so cool?

01:10:12.513 --> 01:10:15.334
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know, it's just, it's something different for once.

01:10:15.715 --> 01:10:19.496
[SPEAKER_10]: I think, it's just, it's so gay.

01:10:22.438 --> 01:10:23.718
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, whoa.

01:10:26.319 --> 01:10:27.640
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch your language, Rob.

01:10:29.261 --> 01:10:34.183
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't mean gay as in butt sex, I mean gay as in happy.

01:10:34.263 --> 01:10:34.943
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, Eminem.

01:10:39.457 --> 01:10:42.038
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, look at Disney Rave, especially like the U.S.

01:10:42.278 --> 01:10:43.039
[SPEAKER_16]: one, Disney Mix.

01:10:43.499 --> 01:10:46.360
[SPEAKER_16]: Dude, you can't pick that up anywhere for under like $130.

01:10:47.041 --> 01:10:47.841
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, my God.

01:10:47.861 --> 01:10:49.282
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, check eBay.

01:10:49.922 --> 01:10:51.883
[SPEAKER_19]: I found it at Network Video for cheap.

01:10:52.603 --> 01:10:54.124
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you get the Japanese or the American one?

01:10:54.964 --> 01:10:59.006
[SPEAKER_19]: The American one is the one that's going for... Oh, I'm talking about the one on the Nintendo 64.

01:10:59.066 --> 01:10:59.767
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, that one.

01:11:01.187 --> 01:11:02.748
[SPEAKER_19]: But I have both of them anyway.

01:11:03.008 --> 01:11:03.949
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, well, so does Mel.

01:11:04.009 --> 01:11:04.829
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, it's no big deal.

01:11:04.889 --> 01:11:06.470
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know, it's like people like...

01:11:07.842 --> 01:11:09.483
[SPEAKER_16]: I really hope Princess Peach is an unlockable character.

01:11:09.503 --> 01:11:09.544
[SPEAKER_16]: If...

01:11:35.655 --> 01:11:37.656
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, this is my letter to Nintendo.

01:11:38.276 --> 01:11:46.480
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear Nintendo, In the upcoming game, DDR with Mario, I hereby request that Princess Peach be a playable character.

01:11:47.261 --> 01:11:50.722
[SPEAKER_09]: If this is to be the case, I will play your game every day.

01:11:51.323 --> 01:11:52.183
[SPEAKER_09]: Drunk off my ass.

01:11:52.964 --> 01:11:53.284
[SPEAKER_09]: Naked.

01:11:54.584 --> 01:12:00.107
[SPEAKER_02]: You know they're gonna pull the whole, was it, um, was it the ME and Ultramix 2 thing?

01:12:00.327 --> 01:12:00.927
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that what it was?

01:12:01.008 --> 01:12:01.868
[SPEAKER_02]: From Ultramix 2 or whatever?

01:12:02.588 --> 01:12:03.429
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the Coochie Cutters?

01:12:03.749 --> 01:12:09.934
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, like, uh, with, uh, they'll do that with Princess Peach, she'll be all, like, whored out and stuff, the Daisy Dukes, and it's like, woo!

01:12:10.094 --> 01:12:10.775
[SPEAKER_33]: That'd be beautiful.

01:12:10.835 --> 01:12:11.515
[SPEAKER_33]: Or not.

01:12:12.736 --> 01:12:16.599
[SPEAKER_16]: If you're a girl, you're with me, it sucks trying to play DDR in a skirt, okay?

01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:20.422
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they better put her in, like, hot pants or something, I don't know.

01:12:22.564 --> 01:12:26.307
[SPEAKER_09]: If the only reason you want Princess Peach in DDR is for an upskirt cam...

01:12:27.353 --> 01:12:28.754
[SPEAKER_09]: You get that in Super Smash Bros.

01:12:28.795 --> 01:12:29.675
[SPEAKER_09]: Melee, my friend.

01:12:30.176 --> 01:12:33.459
[SPEAKER_16]: And may I also say it sucks trying to play DDR in platform boots.

01:12:33.559 --> 01:12:38.083
[SPEAKER_16]: Been there, done that, failed.

01:12:38.223 --> 01:12:42.066
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, my first time on a DDR machine was in somebody else's Broken in Combat boots.

01:12:43.407 --> 01:12:49.232
[SPEAKER_19]: I was cosplaying as Jill Valentine from Resident Evil.

01:12:50.093 --> 01:12:50.954
[SPEAKER_19]: That was pain.

01:12:51.815 --> 01:12:52.996
[SPEAKER_19]: Utter and complete pain.

01:12:54.068 --> 01:13:02.371
[SPEAKER_16]: One of my first times on a DDR machine, especially alone, I was wearing four-inch heels with two-and-a-half-inch platform boots, and I failed Butterfly Basic.

01:13:02.692 --> 01:13:03.392
[SPEAKER_16]: I sucked.

01:13:04.973 --> 01:13:06.793
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't say I've ever played with platform shoes.

01:13:07.594 --> 01:13:08.134
[SPEAKER_02]: Or high heels.

01:13:08.414 --> 01:13:08.854
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank goodness.

01:13:10.675 --> 01:13:12.516
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish I could say the same, but no, I'm kidding.

01:13:12.696 --> 01:13:13.056
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't.

01:13:13.236 --> 01:13:13.596
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, wait.

01:13:13.636 --> 01:13:14.416
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Dick, huh?

01:13:15.757 --> 01:13:16.597
[SPEAKER_09]: Aha!

01:13:16.677 --> 01:13:17.278
[SPEAKER_09]: You funny.

01:13:17.698 --> 01:13:18.038
[SPEAKER_09]: Failed.

01:13:18.058 --> 01:13:19.458
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, Rob, I can lend you the boots.

01:13:19.478 --> 01:13:20.039
[SPEAKER_16]: I still got them.

01:13:20.099 --> 01:13:20.279
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey!

01:13:20.299 --> 01:13:20.359
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:23.080
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

01:13:23.544 --> 01:13:24.745
[SPEAKER_31]: Are you guys still doing comments?

01:13:26.346 --> 01:13:28.588
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Mario, what do you want to say about DDR Mario?

01:13:29.408 --> 01:13:30.910
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, I think it's a very good concept.

01:13:30.970 --> 01:13:35.613
[SPEAKER_31]: Of course, like everyone says, anything with Mario and Luigi would sell, in a way.

01:13:35.993 --> 01:13:40.917
[SPEAKER_31]: And with the new DDR pads for the GameCube, who knows what they'll do with Mario Party 7, maybe.

01:13:43.599 --> 01:13:44.400
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, God.

01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:46.842
[SPEAKER_09]: Mario Party 7, I didn't even think about that.

01:13:46.882 --> 01:13:50.324
[SPEAKER_09]: What's going to be the asinine peripheral that's going to go with Mario Party 7?

01:13:50.404 --> 01:13:51.205
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably this.

01:13:53.266 --> 01:13:56.448
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you seriously played Mario Party 6 with a microphone?

01:13:56.808 --> 01:13:57.149
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

01:13:57.889 --> 01:13:58.669
[SPEAKER_09]: Move up.

01:14:00.230 --> 01:14:01.311
[SPEAKER_09]: Goomba.

01:14:01.391 --> 01:14:01.871
[SPEAKER_09]: Goomba.

01:14:02.192 --> 01:14:03.232
[SPEAKER_09]: Mario Party!

01:14:07.675 --> 01:14:11.998
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you have to go faster, faster, faster, faster, faster, faster, faster, faster!

01:14:12.178 --> 01:14:12.858
[SPEAKER_09]: Mario Party!

01:14:13.159 --> 01:14:13.839
[SPEAKER_05]: Mario Party!

01:14:14.119 --> 01:14:14.760
[SPEAKER_05]: Mario Party!

01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:18.422
[SPEAKER_09]: This is seriously what playing Mario Party 6 sounds like.

01:14:21.144 --> 01:14:21.364
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay.

01:14:23.286 --> 01:14:24.067
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh my gosh.

01:14:24.087 --> 01:14:30.212
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my gosh.

01:14:31.513 --> 01:14:40.300
[SPEAKER_31]: Anyways, but since how like Donkey Kong became like a good, a pretty decent success seller, I think this would sell pretty well.

01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:50.008
[SPEAKER_31]: I wonder what it's going to do with like some of the features, maybe a Koopa Shell while playing the game, and if you touch it you lose health, maybe, sort of like mines, fucking set mania in a way.

01:14:51.630 --> 01:14:55.631
[SPEAKER_31]: or if they play a damn hard song, they actually consider pipe raping or so.

01:14:57.591 --> 01:14:57.911
[SPEAKER_11]: Pipe.

01:14:58.832 --> 01:14:59.672
[SPEAKER_09]: Pipe raping.

01:14:59.732 --> 01:15:00.352
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell?

01:15:04.193 --> 01:15:04.593
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:15:06.713 --> 01:15:07.433
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on.

01:15:07.513 --> 01:15:08.814
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we're going to go to a break.

01:15:08.914 --> 01:15:13.955
[SPEAKER_09]: When we come back from this break, we're going to do a little more news and then the Orange Lounge Radio cage match when we come back.

01:15:15.726 --> 01:15:16.126
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

01:15:16.206 --> 01:15:22.270
[SPEAKER_09]: I just realized I lost all my Poppin' Music 9 consumer tracks when I got my new hard drive, so I don't have that song you wanted.

01:15:22.290 --> 01:15:22.891
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crappy.

01:15:22.911 --> 01:15:23.191
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

01:15:23.211 --> 01:15:24.391
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there something else you wanted to hear, darling?

01:15:25.152 --> 01:15:25.892
[SPEAKER_00]: The Safari.

01:15:26.413 --> 01:15:27.353
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, you got it.

01:15:27.533 --> 01:15:28.154
[SPEAKER_09]: The Safari.

01:15:29.214 --> 01:15:36.719
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be back after this break featuring starting it off with The Safari, and we'll be back with the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, etc., etc.

01:15:36.819 --> 01:15:43.083
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember, if you want to participate in tonight's Cage Match, you've got to be in the chat room, or else it just sucks to be you.

01:15:43.103 --> 01:15:44.504
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio.

01:16:05.343 --> 01:16:06.124
Thanks for watching!

01:17:46.053 --> 01:17:48.014
Thanks for watching!

01:19:19.617 --> 01:19:20.619
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you for watching!

01:20:36.651 --> 01:20:38.113
[SPEAKER_26]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:21:03.928 --> 01:21:04.890
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you for watching!

01:21:37.502 --> 01:21:39.083
[SPEAKER_26]: Gaming Radio, so uncensored.

01:22:07.177 --> 01:22:11.720
[SPEAKER_09]: and even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:13.201
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio.

01:22:17.584 --> 01:22:19.965
[SPEAKER_09]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:22:21.046 --> 01:22:22.767
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for tuning in tonight, boys and girls.

01:22:23.507 --> 01:22:24.228
[SPEAKER_09]: Great turnout.

01:22:24.288 --> 01:22:24.948
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, guys.

01:22:25.028 --> 01:22:27.430
[SPEAKER_09]: We love it when our ratings get whored up.

01:22:27.850 --> 01:22:29.871
[SPEAKER_09]: Not only in studio, but online as well.

01:22:30.352 --> 01:22:33.934
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we broke a record in the chat room with well over 40 people in chat.

01:22:34.014 --> 01:22:34.594
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty crazy.

01:22:35.255 --> 01:22:35.475
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

01:22:36.875 --> 01:22:39.762
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we got more people in here than I've seen in a long time.

01:22:39.802 --> 01:22:40.443
[SPEAKER_09]: This is great.

01:22:41.004 --> 01:22:41.746
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you guys very much.

01:22:43.416 --> 01:22:47.038
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead and open up the Skype line right now if you want to call into the show.

01:22:47.498 --> 01:22:53.021
[SPEAKER_09]: If you are curious about how you use the Skype line, head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com.

01:22:53.341 --> 01:22:57.323
[SPEAKER_09]: Click on Interact With Us, and that will show you how you can interact with the show.

01:22:57.363 --> 01:22:58.563
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I've got to warn you guys, though.

01:22:58.963 --> 01:23:04.566
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there might be some issues with the Skype line tonight, so we're going to kind of play it on the fly.

01:23:04.966 --> 01:23:10.989
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I did make some changes to my computer this week, I think there might be some echoes when you guys are talking on Skype.

01:23:11.289 --> 01:23:12.669
[SPEAKER_09]: And if there is, I apologize.

01:23:12.749 --> 01:23:13.830
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll just see what happens.

01:23:14.810 --> 01:23:17.191
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just going to wing it and try taking a call and see what happens.

01:23:17.231 --> 01:23:18.391
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:23:19.491 --> 01:23:20.752
[SPEAKER_23]: It's me, Legend of Zaku.

01:23:21.132 --> 01:23:23.032
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, it's me, Legend of Zaku.

01:23:23.072 --> 01:23:23.532
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you?

01:23:24.413 --> 01:23:24.793
[SPEAKER_23]: Fine.

01:23:26.153 --> 01:23:26.773
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know.

01:23:26.933 --> 01:23:30.134
[SPEAKER_23]: In two days, we're about to see the new Dancing Stage Fusion.

01:23:30.194 --> 01:23:33.455
[SPEAKER_23]: So I wonder how big is the coverage on that going to be?

01:23:33.475 --> 01:23:36.956
[SPEAKER_23]: Because we're going to find out this new hardware and everything about it.

01:23:37.364 --> 01:23:40.445
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Dancing Stage Fusion... Well, you know, very good point you're bringing up.

01:23:40.485 --> 01:23:43.786
[SPEAKER_09]: Dancing Stage Fusion is supposedly going to be out this week.

01:23:44.226 --> 01:23:47.808
[SPEAKER_09]: So, or we're supposed to... No, it's not that it's out, but we get to see it at some extra.

01:23:47.828 --> 01:23:48.288
[SPEAKER_09]: Two more days.

01:23:48.928 --> 01:23:52.689
[SPEAKER_23]: Tuesday should be... It's going to be debuted on Tuesday in London.

01:23:52.969 --> 01:23:54.610
[SPEAKER_23]: Right, it's going to be at that show, right?

01:23:55.447 --> 01:24:01.851
[SPEAKER_23]: I was just checking out the boards, I mean, I was just checking out the Freak right there, and there's only like a few people that are actually going.

01:24:02.391 --> 01:24:05.633
[SPEAKER_23]: I know one of the mods basically couldn't go that day, but, you know, that's about it.

01:24:05.653 --> 01:24:10.035
[SPEAKER_23]: You know what... I don't know if it's coverage-wise, how... Here's how it works, though, Zaku, seriously.

01:24:10.376 --> 01:24:17.300
[SPEAKER_09]: If one person goes, and one person goes, and one person takes a camera with them, that's all it takes for this to get all over the internet.

01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:19.561
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know some of the big gaming sites are going to be there.

01:24:20.561 --> 01:24:21.082
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say...

01:24:22.963 --> 01:24:25.804
[SPEAKER_23]: I doubt Mist and DDRUK would know.

01:24:26.384 --> 01:24:31.386
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, DDRUK is in a bit of trouble right now.

01:24:31.506 --> 01:24:34.667
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to say you're not going to hear anything from them because I really don't know.

01:24:34.727 --> 01:24:35.508
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't run that site.

01:24:35.548 --> 01:24:36.488
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what they've got planned.

01:24:36.508 --> 01:24:38.989
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know if Mist is going to send people from his site.

01:24:39.893 --> 01:24:43.455
[SPEAKER_23]: and post on the Freak, but we'll just wait and see.

01:24:44.175 --> 01:24:48.797
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hoping, you know what, DDR Freak is usually the hub of all the DDR information.

01:24:49.257 --> 01:24:54.439
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if it gets posted to another site, like Aaron in Japan usually has a lot of news breaks over there.

01:24:55.020 --> 01:24:58.301
[SPEAKER_09]: If they break it, it's going to be posted on DDR Freak.

01:24:58.361 --> 01:24:59.622
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the beauty of the internet.

01:24:59.762 --> 01:25:02.763
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the information superhighway and we all share the information.

01:25:03.323 --> 01:25:06.505
[SPEAKER_09]: You will not be left out in the cold with the information, Zaku.

01:25:06.985 --> 01:25:09.246
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything we find out, Zaku, I assure you we'll bring you.

01:25:09.971 --> 01:25:12.892
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, that's cool.

01:25:13.212 --> 01:25:13.773
[SPEAKER_23]: Let me see.

01:25:14.293 --> 01:25:15.013
[SPEAKER_23]: Anything else?

01:25:15.653 --> 01:25:22.796
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, I got money for buying 2DX products and basically starting to get into that thing.

01:25:22.836 --> 01:25:28.258
[SPEAKER_23]: I just need a great deal on a 2DX controller and at least one style that could be affordable.

01:25:28.698 --> 01:25:30.098
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm going to spend about $100.

01:25:30.358 --> 01:25:31.879
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me poll the chat room right now.

01:25:32.219 --> 01:25:34.640
[SPEAKER_09]: Most affordable 2DX controller you've seen lately?

01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:36.161
[SPEAKER_19]: None of them.

01:25:38.007 --> 01:25:40.088
[SPEAKER_19]: Whatever you do, don't buy the triangular looking one.

01:25:40.208 --> 01:25:41.469
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, don't buy the cheap one.

01:25:41.509 --> 01:25:42.009
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what?

01:25:42.029 --> 01:25:42.550
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what?

01:25:43.690 --> 01:25:45.551
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't buy anything but the official stuff.

01:25:46.212 --> 01:25:47.753
[SPEAKER_19]: You'll be wasting your money otherwise.

01:25:48.793 --> 01:25:49.954
[SPEAKER_19]: You get what you pay for.

01:25:50.034 --> 01:25:51.615
[SPEAKER_19]: If you pay for cheap, you get cheap.

01:25:51.895 --> 01:25:53.196
[SPEAKER_19]: And it breaks in five days.

01:25:55.314 --> 01:25:56.895
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not getting the Rave Discman.

01:25:56.955 --> 01:25:58.996
[SPEAKER_23]: I know that I'm not getting the Rave Discman.

01:25:59.016 --> 01:26:02.559
[SPEAKER_23]: There's no way I'm getting the damn Rave Discman.

01:26:02.599 --> 01:26:03.840
[SPEAKER_19]: Just buy a real controller.

01:26:03.900 --> 01:26:05.081
[SPEAKER_19]: Go to Toys and Joys.

01:26:05.221 --> 01:26:06.142
[SPEAKER_19]: What the?

01:26:06.342 --> 01:26:09.245
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know how they still charge different prices depending on the size.

01:26:09.325 --> 01:26:11.066
[SPEAKER_23]: I know, but you know, they're 80 bucks.

01:26:12.647 --> 01:26:14.809
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how much these puppies cost.

01:26:14.849 --> 01:26:16.670
[SPEAKER_19]: That's cheaper than what I paid for mine.

01:26:16.690 --> 01:26:17.891
[SPEAKER_19]: Shipping's like 40 bucks.

01:26:18.632 --> 01:26:20.273
[SPEAKER_19]: I paid 120 for mine.

01:26:20.894 --> 01:26:22.275
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't complain about 80 dollars.

01:26:23.924 --> 01:26:27.649
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, all I can say, shop around, Zaku.

01:26:27.849 --> 01:26:29.911
[SPEAKER_09]: Go to Toys and Joys, Hameya.

01:26:29.971 --> 01:26:31.834
[SPEAKER_19]: But never order from Byright.

01:26:32.014 --> 01:26:36.679
[SPEAKER_19]: Never, ever, ever, ever order from Byright because they will screw you.

01:26:37.821 --> 01:26:38.481
[SPEAKER_09]: Without lube.

01:26:39.062 --> 01:26:40.043
[SPEAKER_19]: It will be painful.

01:26:41.044 --> 01:26:42.526
[SPEAKER_09]: Shop around, Zaku.

01:26:42.546 --> 01:26:43.247
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the best you can do.

01:26:44.672 --> 01:26:46.393
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, bud, I'm going to let you go so we can take another call.

01:26:46.593 --> 01:26:47.494
[SPEAKER_09]: But thanks for calling in, as always.

01:26:47.514 --> 01:26:48.354
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, thanks a lot, man.

01:26:48.394 --> 01:26:48.875
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care, Zach.

01:26:49.755 --> 01:26:50.736
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to the next call.

01:26:50.776 --> 01:26:52.317
[SPEAKER_09]: I see another line ringing here.

01:26:52.657 --> 01:26:55.158
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:26:56.299 --> 01:26:56.859
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, what's up?

01:26:56.879 --> 01:26:58.840
[SPEAKER_09]: This is DJ Ranma S from the East Coast.

01:26:58.900 --> 01:27:00.801
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a box full of snow for you guys.

01:27:01.081 --> 01:27:04.403
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, hooray, snow, because we don't get that here, seriously.

01:27:05.264 --> 01:27:06.064
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of figured.

01:27:06.525 --> 01:27:07.705
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind, Ranma S?

01:27:09.046 --> 01:27:09.766
[SPEAKER_09]: Ranma.

01:27:10.107 --> 01:27:10.707
[SPEAKER_09]: Ranma.

01:27:12.541 --> 01:27:16.742
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know, if you wanted to be literal, you could just call him Wild Horse S, because that's what Ranma means.

01:27:16.762 --> 01:27:17.703
[SPEAKER_09]: How about Ranmask?

01:27:17.743 --> 01:27:19.243
[SPEAKER_09]: You want me to start calling you Ranmask?

01:27:20.183 --> 01:27:22.184
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, Sky, you can call me whatever you like.

01:27:22.324 --> 01:27:23.584
[SPEAKER_06]: Call me through the phone.

01:27:24.004 --> 01:27:24.825
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, George.

01:27:25.105 --> 01:27:25.245
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

01:27:25.585 --> 01:27:26.185
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind?

01:27:27.005 --> 01:27:28.766
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't much want to know how you guys are doing over there.

01:27:28.806 --> 01:27:30.906
[SPEAKER_06]: I want some of that warm weather, because I'm freezing here.

01:27:31.246 --> 01:27:33.627
[SPEAKER_09]: We will put some warm weather in a box and send it to you.

01:27:33.747 --> 01:27:34.287
[SPEAKER_09]: How does that sound?

01:27:35.147 --> 01:27:35.668
[SPEAKER_09]: Even trade?

01:27:36.428 --> 01:27:36.968
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, why not?

01:27:37.679 --> 01:27:38.939
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, that works for me, boys.

01:27:38.979 --> 01:27:39.999
[SPEAKER_06]: That works great for me.

01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:42.180
[SPEAKER_09]: What's going on on the East Coast scene right now?

01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:43.840
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, not much.

01:27:43.900 --> 01:27:46.261
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been... Everybody's just dealing with the snow.

01:27:46.281 --> 01:27:48.601
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, we got like two feet over here.

01:27:48.641 --> 01:27:50.382
[SPEAKER_06]: People complaining about the weather, you know.

01:27:51.162 --> 01:27:51.882
[SPEAKER_06]: Work sucks.

01:27:51.942 --> 01:27:55.323
[SPEAKER_06]: People complain that we closed early yesterday, but we were in the middle of a snowstorm.

01:27:55.343 --> 01:27:56.203
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you expect us to do?

01:27:56.503 --> 01:28:00.404
[SPEAKER_09]: I could not imagine anything closing due to snow.

01:28:01.064 --> 01:28:02.624
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm spoiled by California.

01:28:02.644 --> 01:28:03.104
[SPEAKER_09]: What can I say?

01:28:04.484 --> 01:28:07.005
[SPEAKER_06]: Right or not, I would love to be in California for about a good two weeks.

01:28:07.926 --> 01:28:18.294
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, didn't you come out here for the expo, or am I getting my... No, no, no, no, I'm not coming out for Anime Expo, but I am coming out there for Anime Vegas sometime in September.

01:28:18.475 --> 01:28:19.575
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, I want to go to Vegas.

01:28:19.595 --> 01:28:21.737
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever you do, never go to AX, because it sucks.

01:28:22.378 --> 01:28:23.779
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to Anime this year.

01:28:24.559 --> 01:28:26.121
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no plans to go to AX.

01:28:26.761 --> 01:28:32.025
[SPEAKER_06]: I sent some friends of mine out there from the Econ Reports, they said it sucked, so I have no plans to go.

01:28:32.826 --> 01:28:35.688
[SPEAKER_19]: Someone, I was cosplaying Mad Hatter.

01:28:36.297 --> 01:28:38.738
[SPEAKER_19]: I said, did you snap their neck or send somebody after them to hurt them?

01:28:39.038 --> 01:28:42.779
[SPEAKER_19]: I still didn't hear Did you snap their neck or send somebody after them to hurt them?

01:29:06.353 --> 01:29:09.375
[SPEAKER_19]: I did step on somebody's foot in the 4-inch boots.

01:29:10.296 --> 01:29:11.036
[SPEAKER_06]: That works for me.

01:29:11.116 --> 01:29:11.636
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

01:29:12.817 --> 01:29:13.698
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else on your mind?

01:29:14.578 --> 01:29:15.178
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's it.

01:29:15.198 --> 01:29:16.539
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to hear you guys.

01:29:16.559 --> 01:29:17.400
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all, basically.

01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:18.420
[SPEAKER_09]: Love the show.

01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:20.241
[SPEAKER_09]: Thoughts on DDR Mario, real quick.

01:29:22.003 --> 01:29:24.244
[SPEAKER_06]: I already have it pre-reserved at my store.

01:29:24.824 --> 01:29:25.625
[SPEAKER_09]: Then there you have it.

01:29:25.765 --> 01:29:26.705
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, thanks for calling.

01:29:28.246 --> 01:29:28.546
[SPEAKER_06]: Laters.

01:29:28.747 --> 01:29:29.387
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good one, buddy.

01:29:30.407 --> 01:29:31.608
[SPEAKER_09]: We're hearing from all sorts of people.

01:29:31.628 --> 01:29:33.109
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do one more call, then we'll get to the cage match.

01:29:33.429 --> 01:29:34.450
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:29:35.478 --> 01:29:36.799
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey Sky, it's El Mullet.

01:29:36.939 --> 01:29:38.119
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello El Mullet!

01:29:38.620 --> 01:29:39.560
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello Sky!

01:29:39.820 --> 01:29:42.062
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, he with my favorite nickname on the internet.

01:29:42.082 --> 01:29:42.482
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up?

01:29:44.383 --> 01:29:45.924
[SPEAKER_04]: Today's a pretty big day for me.

01:29:46.084 --> 01:29:47.504
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to move back into school.

01:29:47.564 --> 01:29:48.825
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in the dorm room right now.

01:29:49.546 --> 01:29:50.506
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, dorm life.

01:29:50.626 --> 01:29:51.767
[SPEAKER_09]: Duh, duh, duh.

01:29:51.987 --> 01:29:52.867
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, man.

01:29:53.428 --> 01:29:53.828
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

01:29:53.868 --> 01:29:55.449
[SPEAKER_04]: Bad internet connections and all.

01:29:55.649 --> 01:29:56.769
[SPEAKER_09]: Quick poll in the studio.

01:29:56.809 --> 01:29:58.330
[SPEAKER_09]: Who here has lived in a college dorm?

01:29:59.591 --> 01:30:00.852
[SPEAKER_09]: Just me and Jamie?

01:30:01.272 --> 01:30:01.652
[SPEAKER_21]: That's it?

01:30:02.017 --> 01:30:02.997
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, oh my god.

01:30:03.057 --> 01:30:03.718
[SPEAKER_09]: College dorm life.

01:30:03.738 --> 01:30:05.278
[SPEAKER_21]: Living in the dorm was the best.

01:30:05.558 --> 01:30:07.959
[SPEAKER_09]: Living in the dorm was horrible, horrible, horrible.

01:30:07.999 --> 01:30:09.259
[SPEAKER_09]: I would never wish that upon anybody.

01:30:09.639 --> 01:30:17.122
[SPEAKER_19]: My dorm was so awesome because, first of all, our person who watched us never really cared what we did.

01:30:17.582 --> 01:30:18.702
[SPEAKER_19]: So my friend had durables.

01:30:19.022 --> 01:30:19.983
[SPEAKER_19]: They were the VCRs.

01:30:21.823 --> 01:30:30.506
[SPEAKER_19]: And then I also lived within walking distance of a bar slash deli slash arcade that would get imports and pirate kits.

01:30:31.434 --> 01:30:32.015
[SPEAKER_19]: All the time.

01:30:33.136 --> 01:30:34.658
[SPEAKER_19]: And they were open 24 hours.

01:30:35.519 --> 01:30:36.019
[SPEAKER_09]: Dang.

01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:37.301
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty nice.

01:30:38.302 --> 01:30:43.608
[SPEAKER_09]: The only good thing about living in the dorms for me was that I was the only one that had a Super Nintendo.

01:30:44.089 --> 01:30:46.712
[SPEAKER_09]: So all the boys would come over and play Mario Kart.

01:30:47.205 --> 01:30:51.027
[SPEAKER_19]: My roommate actually had a Playstation when it came out and I had a TV and she didn't.

01:30:51.447 --> 01:30:53.648
[SPEAKER_19]: So we had it hooked up at a VCR.

01:30:53.688 --> 01:30:55.548
[SPEAKER_19]: I would skip my witchcraft class.

01:30:56.249 --> 01:30:57.269
[SPEAKER_19]: I took History of Witchcraft.

01:30:57.569 --> 01:30:58.009
[SPEAKER_09]: I did too.

01:30:58.469 --> 01:30:59.710
[SPEAKER_19]: To watch Sailor Moon.

01:31:00.650 --> 01:31:02.391
[SPEAKER_19]: It just dates when I lived in the dorms.

01:31:02.935 --> 01:31:07.339
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you're guaranteed college popularity if you have something very obscure.

01:31:07.939 --> 01:31:11.262
[SPEAKER_09]: See, I didn't quite get to the second half of my story.

01:31:11.322 --> 01:31:19.609
[SPEAKER_09]: See, I was popular when I had the Super Nintendo, but then when the upstairs guys got the Nintendo 64, nobody loved Rob anymore.

01:31:20.029 --> 01:31:21.590
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody loved Rob anymore.

01:31:22.931 --> 01:31:27.055
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, the other thing that was cool about me living on campus is I had a job on campus.

01:31:27.575 --> 01:31:29.457
[SPEAKER_19]: I worked in our pool hall slash arcade.

01:31:30.257 --> 01:31:30.758
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's cool.

01:31:31.352 --> 01:31:35.835
[SPEAKER_19]: and I ran our tournaments and my first time playing a Saturn was playing Japanese games.

01:31:36.135 --> 01:31:36.876
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

01:31:37.436 --> 01:31:40.779
[SPEAKER_09]: Our college built an arcade the year after I left.

01:31:41.299 --> 01:31:41.980
[SPEAKER_09]: Those cocks.

01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:42.820
[SPEAKER_22]: Sucky.

01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:43.341
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

01:31:43.641 --> 01:31:45.282
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, I'm sorry, Elmo, we got sidetracked.

01:31:45.302 --> 01:31:46.763
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you call in to talk to us about tonight?

01:31:47.483 --> 01:31:50.446
[SPEAKER_09]: I called to talk about various things.

01:31:50.786 --> 01:31:51.186
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

01:31:52.227 --> 01:31:53.888
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR Mario, for example.

01:31:53.948 --> 01:31:55.209
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really looking forward to it.

01:31:56.330 --> 01:31:58.151
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I want to know your thoughts on DDR Mario.

01:31:59.178 --> 01:32:06.941
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, first of all, considering it's a joint project between Konami and Nintendo, I mean, how can that possibly go wrong?

01:32:07.962 --> 01:32:14.545
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, I'm just a giddy little fanboy thinking about the possibilities when Konami and Nintendo join forces.

01:32:14.665 --> 01:32:15.885
[SPEAKER_09]: This game's going to rock.

01:32:16.265 --> 01:32:20.207
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be really nauseously cute, but it's going to rock.

01:32:20.971 --> 01:32:22.272
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, wait a minute, I'm a Nintendo fanboy!

01:32:50.681 --> 01:32:53.602
[SPEAKER_09]: Any wishes, things you want to see in DDR Mario?

01:32:54.523 --> 01:33:01.525
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see a crapload of Konami original remixes of Nintendo songs.

01:33:01.545 --> 01:33:02.305
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be incredible.

01:33:02.325 --> 01:33:03.325
[SPEAKER_09]: I need lots of Taku.

01:33:14.685 --> 01:33:16.867
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Jamie wants Taku to come over and remix and stuff.

01:33:16.887 --> 01:33:20.410
[SPEAKER_19]: Imagine Taku doing, like, the dungeon one from the first Super Mario Bros.

01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:24.854
[SPEAKER_19]: Seriously, could you imagine it?

01:33:25.474 --> 01:33:26.175
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be pretty hot.

01:33:26.635 --> 01:33:31.159
[SPEAKER_04]: If I had one wish, I want a dance remix of the Zelda 2 dungeon theme.

01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:40.327
[SPEAKER_44]: Oh, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-

01:33:44.474 --> 01:33:46.454
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and then we have a comment in the chat room.

01:33:46.474 --> 01:33:50.095
[SPEAKER_09]: Miklatov, Akira Yamaoka better fucking be in it remixing anything.

01:33:51.035 --> 01:33:51.395
[SPEAKER_04]: Amen to that.

01:33:51.415 --> 01:33:54.296
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a great Mario happy joy go lucky mix.

01:33:54.316 --> 01:33:55.276
[SPEAKER_09]: Winner is you.

01:33:55.376 --> 01:34:00.337
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, seriously, if he can do like Bitmania and all that stuff, imagine him remixing like a Mario theme.

01:34:01.177 --> 01:34:01.937
[SPEAKER_09]: I just got a boner.

01:34:02.377 --> 01:34:02.677
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

01:34:03.497 --> 01:34:03.697
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

01:34:03.857 --> 01:34:04.237
[SPEAKER_19]: Kidding.

01:34:04.377 --> 01:34:04.697
[SPEAKER_19]: Kidding.

01:34:04.757 --> 01:34:08.398
[SPEAKER_19]: No, Akira Yamaoka remixing music from Luigi's Mansion.

01:34:10.198 --> 01:34:11.979
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we want music that people have actually heard.

01:34:13.059 --> 01:34:13.339
What?

01:34:14.858 --> 01:34:18.139
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you think Luigi's Mansion was kind of fun, spooky?

01:34:18.199 --> 01:34:19.639
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, but the game was kind of not.

01:34:19.659 --> 01:34:20.600
[SPEAKER_19]: The game was cute.

01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:24.301
[SPEAKER_04]: Luigi's Mansion was a great YouTube tech demo.

01:34:25.161 --> 01:34:25.981
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty much it.

01:34:26.001 --> 01:34:28.842
[SPEAKER_04]: If it came with the system, it would have been a hell of a lot better.

01:34:29.022 --> 01:34:31.102
[SPEAKER_04]: But we had to pay $50 for it, so.

01:34:32.483 --> 01:34:35.204
[SPEAKER_02]: Personally, I think it sucked.

01:34:36.184 --> 01:34:36.524
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it?

01:34:37.539 --> 01:34:40.422
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Luigi had a vacuum.

01:34:41.463 --> 01:34:43.445
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, why did I call him?

01:34:43.525 --> 01:34:44.026
[SPEAKER_03]: Loser!

01:34:45.968 --> 01:34:51.073
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, any other thoughts on your mind, Elmullet, on this lovely Sunday evening?

01:34:51.653 --> 01:34:52.854
[SPEAKER_03]: There are many, many thoughts.

01:34:52.954 --> 01:34:54.196
[SPEAKER_04]: Which one would you like me to share?

01:34:55.137 --> 01:34:55.697
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:34:56.898 --> 01:34:57.539
[SPEAKER_04]: The third one.

01:34:58.325 --> 01:34:59.185
[SPEAKER_04]: The third one?

01:35:00.286 --> 01:35:00.846
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:35:00.906 --> 01:35:01.966
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little risque.

01:35:02.867 --> 01:35:05.548
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll just skip to the fourth one and chill out my side again.

01:35:06.968 --> 01:35:07.148
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

01:35:07.168 --> 01:35:07.449
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

01:35:07.489 --> 01:35:07.849
[SPEAKER_09]: I missed that.

01:35:08.569 --> 01:35:10.910
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just skip to the fourth one and chill out my side again.

01:35:11.490 --> 01:35:11.790
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

01:35:12.090 --> 01:35:12.450
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

01:35:12.510 --> 01:35:12.931
[SPEAKER_09]: Go for it.

01:35:13.851 --> 01:35:20.594
[SPEAKER_04]: www.insidepulse.com Go to the game section and read me specifically and other people because they're awesome.

01:35:21.594 --> 01:35:25.015
[SPEAKER_09]: We only let him whore out that because he whores us out all the time.

01:35:25.615 --> 01:35:26.196
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week.

01:35:26.756 --> 01:35:26.976
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

01:35:27.438 --> 01:35:28.859
[SPEAKER_09]: We appreciate the whoring out, buddy.

01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:30.140
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.

01:35:30.220 --> 01:35:35.144
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we're looking forward to more information on DDR Mario showing up on Inside Pulse as it comes out.

01:35:35.644 --> 01:35:35.984
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

01:35:36.064 --> 01:35:36.785
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, take care, bud.

01:35:37.866 --> 01:35:38.106
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

01:35:38.446 --> 01:35:38.726
[SPEAKER_09]: Later.

01:35:39.527 --> 01:35:40.968
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura has an announcement.

01:35:41.368 --> 01:35:41.969
[SPEAKER_19]: In local news.

01:35:42.629 --> 01:35:43.350
[SPEAKER_09]: In local news.

01:35:44.411 --> 01:35:47.593
[SPEAKER_19]: I put the final nail in the coffin on Sackbimani today.

01:35:49.134 --> 01:35:51.756
[SPEAKER_09]: Aww, Sackbimani is dead and gone and is no more.

01:35:51.776 --> 01:35:54.038
[SPEAKER_19]: Is making way for Deathcake.com.

01:35:56.491 --> 01:35:59.053
[SPEAKER_09]: Since you're not going to say it anymore, Addict!

01:36:00.514 --> 01:36:01.555
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know we love you.

01:36:01.975 --> 01:36:03.977
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not doing this for myself, I'm doing it for you guys.

01:36:04.257 --> 01:36:04.537
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

01:36:04.578 --> 01:36:09.341
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'm still probably not going to play more than a couple... It's group addiction therapy for you.

01:36:10.983 --> 01:36:12.624
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm still going to be too busy with school.

01:36:12.644 --> 01:36:13.865
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, it's all good.

01:36:15.137 --> 01:36:18.859
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we're going to... Is that all you wanted to say about... You know what, though?

01:36:18.979 --> 01:36:24.261
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta say, though, it is kind of sad to see Sakpamani go bye-bye, because it was kind of, you know... Not my fault it died.

01:36:24.482 --> 01:36:25.262
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, I know.

01:36:25.322 --> 01:36:42.010
[SPEAKER_09]: It was kind of the way we all got to know each other, and I think LiveJournal kind of... Not everyone would rather post in the crappy RBGL thread on... Well, the cool thing about the Sakpamani forums was that they had, like, the masturbation thread and things like that, and now people use their LiveJournals for that stuff, so... Still have a community.

01:36:42.728 --> 01:36:45.429
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, I'm going to go start a masturbation thread on my life journal right now.

01:36:47.189 --> 01:36:49.030
[SPEAKER_19]: I can post it on my life journal right now.

01:36:49.050 --> 01:36:49.850
[SPEAKER_09]: Just kidding.

01:36:50.530 --> 01:36:51.011
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kidding.

01:36:51.031 --> 01:36:51.871
[SPEAKER_09]: Gross.

01:36:52.691 --> 01:36:54.091
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, wait a minute.

01:36:54.191 --> 01:36:54.672
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm hot.

01:36:57.552 --> 01:37:00.573
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, if you get defriended by me in the next couple of days, you know why.

01:37:04.535 --> 01:37:06.015
[SPEAKER_19]: You need to play with the mouse a little bit.

01:37:07.195 --> 01:37:07.615
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait a minute.

01:37:07.696 --> 01:37:09.596
[SPEAKER_09]: Is Jamie telling Brad to click the mouse over there?

01:37:09.776 --> 01:37:11.497
[SPEAKER_17]: No, but we do need to be focused on the chat room.

01:37:12.357 --> 01:37:12.617
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:37:13.047 --> 01:37:16.369
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, let's get to the Orange Lounge Radio cage match, shall we?

01:37:18.011 --> 01:37:22.974
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though I'm totally not ready to do the cage match tonight.

01:37:24.595 --> 01:37:27.557
[SPEAKER_09]: I need some more time filler here while I set up for cage match.

01:37:27.597 --> 01:37:27.878
[SPEAKER_09]: Help!

01:37:32.241 --> 01:37:33.662
[SPEAKER_09]: What is going on over there in the kitchen?

01:37:36.183 --> 01:37:37.344
[SPEAKER_09]: They're having an orgy in the kitchen.

01:37:41.547 --> 01:37:42.028
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, boy.

01:37:42.148 --> 01:37:42.568
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:37:46.256 --> 01:37:49.798
[SPEAKER_09]: The Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match Boys and Girls

01:38:07.569 --> 01:38:08.930
[SPEAKER_09]: and you can make a vote, okay?

01:38:09.470 --> 01:38:18.954
[SPEAKER_09]: The winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music & More program which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on this station when we're not live.

01:38:19.314 --> 01:38:21.315
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so it's your chance to pick a song.

01:38:22.056 --> 01:38:25.017
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, first off, you get to hear a clip of last week's winner.

01:38:25.257 --> 01:38:30.159
[SPEAKER_09]: You only get to hear a clip because it was the winner, so you already heard it because you listen to the show every week, right?

01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:31.200
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, here it is.

01:38:31.901 --> 01:38:33.022
[SPEAKER_09]: A clip of song number one.

01:38:33.082 --> 01:38:37.023
[SPEAKER_09]: And remember guys, you cannot vote until all three songs have played in their entirety.

01:38:37.043 --> 01:38:38.443
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we'll tell you how to vote in the chat.

01:38:38.744 --> 01:38:39.224
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, here it is.

01:38:39.624 --> 01:38:42.005
[SPEAKER_09]: Last week in the Orange Lounge Cage Match, we had a brand new winner.

01:38:42.385 --> 01:38:44.466
[SPEAKER_09]: An old favorite, Echo Image.

01:38:44.826 --> 01:38:47.927
[SPEAKER_09]: And here it is, song number one, Echo Image with Endless Day.

01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:26.288
DarkSakura

01:40:40.366 --> 01:40:44.530
They used to make much sense, but I was wrong

01:41:00.757 --> 01:41:05.560
[SPEAKER_09]: Challenger number one comes to us from DarkSakura, and you get to hear these songs in their entirety.

01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:07.541
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, what's challenger number one tonight?

01:41:07.642 --> 01:41:09.923
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, it's DJ Bobo, I believe.

01:41:11.024 --> 01:41:17.208
[SPEAKER_19]: I was at Tapioca Express last night, and they put in a DVD, and this song was on it, and the video was just really awesome.

01:41:17.868 --> 01:41:23.392
[SPEAKER_19]: And I instantly fell for this song, so I at least have an opportunity now to share it with everybody.

01:41:24.232 --> 01:41:24.532
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:41:25.333 --> 01:41:25.813
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else?

01:41:26.334 --> 01:41:26.514
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

01:41:26.534 --> 01:41:26.914
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:41:27.349 --> 01:41:29.090
[SPEAKER_19]: Does there have to always be something?

01:41:29.370 --> 01:41:31.290
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but I just liked your description of the video.

01:41:31.970 --> 01:41:53.077
[SPEAKER_19]: The video was, okay, the video had this one guy getting onto a subway car, and there was, you know, just people of all types sitting around, just minding their own business, being singular, and then he starts handing out beer to everybody, to a nun, to this old man, to this kid, and also to everyone's own, oh, we're unified and we like beer.

01:41:54.557 --> 01:41:54.977
[SPEAKER_19]: Singing.

01:41:55.558 --> 01:41:56.058
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool.

01:41:56.078 --> 01:41:56.478
[SPEAKER_19]: Over beer.

01:41:57.168 --> 01:41:58.569
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:42:17.717 --> 01:42:19.118
[SPEAKER_09]: The orgy's going somewhere else.

01:42:19.138 --> 01:42:19.698
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thanks for coming.

01:42:19.718 --> 01:42:20.958
[SPEAKER_16]: We're relocating to the wild.

01:42:21.238 --> 01:42:24.720
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's amazingly funny that we have the longest drive of all, and we're staying to the end.

01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:25.920
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you're troopers.

01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:30.582
[SPEAKER_09]: You're real fans, Shark Skrull, Mel B. We are hardcore like the Peach Pits.

01:42:31.783 --> 01:42:33.604
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, let's get to Jamie's song.

01:42:33.644 --> 01:42:33.984
[SPEAKER_10]: Here it is.

01:42:34.324 --> 01:42:37.265
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Bobo with... I Believe.

01:42:37.425 --> 01:42:37.825
[SPEAKER_09]: I Believe.

01:42:37.845 --> 01:42:38.946
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Bobo, I Believe.

01:42:38.986 --> 01:42:40.226
[SPEAKER_09]: Song number two in tonight's cage match.

01:42:40.246 --> 01:42:40.486
[SPEAKER_09]: Enjoy.

01:42:51.523 --> 01:42:52.683
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on, small glitch there.

01:42:52.743 --> 01:42:53.244
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, guys.

01:42:53.384 --> 01:42:55.004
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me start it over here.

01:42:55.184 --> 01:42:55.805
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry about that.

01:42:55.845 --> 01:42:57.185
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got to bring up the audio levels.

01:42:57.225 --> 01:42:59.907
[SPEAKER_09]: Here it is, song number two, DJ Bobo, I Believe.

01:43:07.090 --> 01:43:08.971
[SPEAKER_28]: I believe in magic

01:43:17.883 --> 01:43:22.808
[SPEAKER_28]: I believe in freedom I believe in dreams I believe in

01:43:51.991 --> 01:43:55.991
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm afraid we've placed our life in another piece

01:44:37.903 --> 01:44:40.052
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for watching!

01:45:38.897 --> 01:45:52.198
[SPEAKER_28]: I believe I believe my dream can be reality I believe my time on earth is destiny

01:46:10.035 --> 01:46:14.538
I believe in love, I believe in magic, this is not enough, we are strong enough

01:46:42.333 --> 01:46:43.093
[SPEAKER_09]: All righty, guys.

01:46:43.113 --> 01:46:44.655
[SPEAKER_09]: That was song number two.

01:46:44.675 --> 01:46:47.917
[SPEAKER_09]: That was DJ Bobo with I Believe.

01:46:48.018 --> 01:46:49.399
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we believe in this song?

01:46:50.019 --> 01:46:50.580
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's find out.

01:46:50.620 --> 01:46:50.860
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie.

01:46:51.140 --> 01:46:52.842
[SPEAKER_19]: I was just transfixed by this video.

01:46:54.203 --> 01:46:57.166
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sitting there eating my tater tots and curry at CapEx.

01:46:57.926 --> 01:46:59.027
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm like, ooh.

01:46:59.448 --> 01:47:00.208
[SPEAKER_19]: So I give it a ten.

01:47:01.029 --> 01:47:01.369
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:47:02.210 --> 01:47:02.711
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's got the mic?

01:47:02.731 --> 01:47:03.171
[SPEAKER_09]: Shark Skrull.

01:47:04.768 --> 01:47:05.649
[SPEAKER_16]: 8.395 from Shark Scroll.

01:47:05.669 --> 01:47:06.009
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, Explicit.

01:47:06.029 --> 01:47:06.730
[SPEAKER_16]: 8.5 from Explicit.

01:47:06.990 --> 01:47:07.411
[SPEAKER_16]: Mel B.

01:47:31.654 --> 01:47:36.775
[SPEAKER_35]: Um, kind of throws me back to like the late 90s type of club techno type stuff.

01:47:37.175 --> 01:47:40.416
[SPEAKER_35]: Kind of sounds like No Mercy except a lot less whistled.

01:47:41.236 --> 01:47:42.777
[SPEAKER_35]: Um, I'll give it a 7.92.

01:47:43.917 --> 01:47:49.659
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, um, for me personally, I definitely agree.

01:47:49.679 --> 01:47:51.439
[SPEAKER_09]: I was thinking the mid 90s thing as well.

01:47:51.859 --> 01:47:54.820
[SPEAKER_09]: Like an inspirational, I can do anything.

01:47:56.340 --> 01:47:58.002
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe I can fly like this.

01:47:58.062 --> 01:47:58.362
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

01:47:58.402 --> 01:47:59.103
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like an inspirational.

01:47:59.403 --> 01:48:06.830
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is why I'm thinking about Jamie describing the video a little bit before and I'm like, that totally goes against that song.

01:48:07.171 --> 01:48:08.432
[SPEAKER_19]: No, it was about...

01:48:10.003 --> 01:48:11.084
[SPEAKER_19]: It was like a unity thing.

01:48:11.104 --> 01:48:11.784
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe in beer.

01:48:11.824 --> 01:48:13.264
[SPEAKER_19]: Everybody getting together over beer.

01:48:13.425 --> 01:48:17.266
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, I'm not supposed, we're not supposed to take the videos into account during these Caged Vegetables.

01:48:17.286 --> 01:48:26.510
[SPEAKER_09]: So the song, Strictly Yourself, it was, I like the throwback aspect of it and it left me, it left me feeling hopeful and inspirational and making me want to pray.

01:48:26.691 --> 01:48:28.731
[SPEAKER_09]: So I give it a 6.66.

01:48:29.212 --> 01:48:30.532
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I gotta give it something higher than that.

01:48:30.732 --> 01:48:31.353
[SPEAKER_09]: An 8.666.

01:48:31.893 --> 01:48:36.215
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe I was bored, so I get the 7.

01:48:39.167 --> 01:48:42.093
[SPEAKER_09]: You know he's got to have his lame pun or it's just not a show.

01:48:42.594 --> 01:48:43.536
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, here we go.

01:48:43.596 --> 01:48:45.400
[SPEAKER_09]: Song number three from Loki.

01:48:47.049 --> 01:48:49.971
[SPEAKER_07]: I was gonna put in the girls remix.

01:48:50.572 --> 01:48:58.057
[SPEAKER_07]: I was told in the chatroom to do it, I was told by Jamie to do it, but my judgment, you know, said no, that would be wrong.

01:48:58.218 --> 01:48:59.579
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll do it next week if this doesn't win.

01:48:59.859 --> 01:49:04.923
[SPEAKER_07]: This is, um, I don't know for how many of you out there have seen the Sin City trailer.

01:49:05.603 --> 01:49:08.585
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, this is a song playing in the background, except that's the instrumental version.

01:49:08.625 --> 01:49:11.668
[SPEAKER_07]: This is The Cells by a group called The Servant.

01:49:13.609 --> 01:49:16.111
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, song number three, The Cells by The Servant.

01:49:17.096 --> 01:49:42.715
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll all click when the mortgage clears All our fears will disappear Now you go to bed

01:49:45.576 --> 01:49:46.957
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:50:13.275 --> 01:50:27.818
I look for each other in the TV screen The sun goes up and the sun goes down I drag myself into the sand All I do, all I do is dance with you Every day I'm at my dad's And my dad's got right there All I do, all I do

01:50:47.236 --> 01:50:51.382
[SPEAKER_29]: on the back of a manky cat now in I go like a

01:51:02.617 --> 01:51:18.320
[SPEAKER_39]: I watch them, watch me, I watch them too Across the street, across the room I dress myself like a charcoal sketch My eyes are brown and my hair's a mess They annoy me, they do employ me They could destroy me, they should enjoy me We Chinese are funny We look for each other in the TV screen

01:51:37.288 --> 01:51:50.417
The sun goes up and the sun goes down, DarkSakura tells me to look down, All I do, all I wanna do is... Every day is not my day, Can I take a break from this?

01:51:50.517 --> 01:51:51.538
All I do...

01:52:04.885 --> 01:52:11.912
The sales I am at the moment will soon die, but I will be here

01:52:31.798 --> 01:52:46.329
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, I'll still be here Just as I am at the moment We'll soon die But I won't be here Oh, I'll still be

01:53:09.302 --> 01:53:10.224
Thanks for watching!

01:54:12.741 --> 01:54:16.882
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, that was song number three, The Servant with the Cells.

01:54:17.123 --> 01:54:20.464
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see if that was good cells or bad cells.

01:54:20.864 --> 01:54:21.184
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie?

01:54:21.784 --> 01:54:22.764
[SPEAKER_19]: Mitochondria.

01:54:22.784 --> 01:54:23.985
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like parasites.

01:54:24.585 --> 01:54:26.646
[SPEAKER_19]: Um... And...

01:54:28.976 --> 01:54:30.477
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura.com

01:54:49.790 --> 01:54:50.050
[SPEAKER_16]: 6.8 Mel B

01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:17.381
[SPEAKER_35]: Um, it's quite a pretty good ambiance, actually.

01:55:17.581 --> 01:55:24.902
[SPEAKER_35]: I mean, not something I would bump in my system or nothing like that, but it kind of has a very, kind of a dark theme to it, obviously.

01:55:25.042 --> 01:55:29.063
[SPEAKER_35]: Kind of throws me to the, uh, Silent Hill 4 type, uh, music.

01:55:29.123 --> 01:55:31.043
[SPEAKER_35]: I was digging it, actually.

01:55:31.163 --> 01:55:39.325
[SPEAKER_35]: I'd give it a... But, although, when, you know, Loki was talking about Wildcard, I was expecting something wild, but it's all good.

01:55:39.345 --> 01:55:40.585
[SPEAKER_35]: I'll give it an 8.12.

01:55:41.285 --> 01:55:43.966
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, my thoughts, personally, um, I would say...

01:55:46.134 --> 01:55:48.355
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the song, actually, quite a bit.

01:55:48.375 --> 01:55:49.335
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd probably give it like an 8.

01:55:50.136 --> 01:55:54.438
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just don't see it in an Orange Launch Radio cage match.

01:55:54.558 --> 01:55:56.259
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't gel right.

01:55:56.299 --> 01:55:57.100
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't click for me.

01:55:58.220 --> 01:56:00.942
[SPEAKER_09]: So I give it a... I would have given that even less score.

01:56:02.283 --> 01:56:04.084
[SPEAKER_09]: I give it like a 6.5.

01:56:06.125 --> 01:56:08.086
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to see this with the trailer.

01:56:08.386 --> 01:56:09.847
[SPEAKER_07]: It is goddamn sexy.

01:56:09.927 --> 01:56:10.967
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I have to say.

01:56:11.428 --> 01:56:11.808
[SPEAKER_07]: Because...

01:56:12.358 --> 01:56:41.490
[SPEAKER_07]: now the instrumental version is going to be in the movie I think actually the guy's voice kind of takes away from the song because you missed all the cool guitar riffs but um I was looking hard for that instrumental version but I couldn't find it because the soundtrack's not out yet so but god damn it go see Sin City it's going to be fucking awesome coming out April 1st April 1st see Sin City the only movie you'll need to see the entire year screw Star Wars and King Kong this is the best movie ever

01:56:42.748 --> 01:56:43.228
[SPEAKER_07]: and I give it a 10.

01:56:45.529 --> 01:56:48.591
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, it's not up to us to decide, it's up to you to decide.

01:56:48.611 --> 01:56:50.732
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to place your vote for one of these three songs.

01:56:51.152 --> 01:56:53.553
[SPEAKER_09]: Song number one, Echo Image, Endless Day.

01:57:03.338 --> 01:57:08.821
[SPEAKER_09]: Song number two is DJ Bobo with a song called I Believe.

01:57:22.132 --> 01:57:26.113
[SPEAKER_09]: And song number three, The Servant, with a song called The Cells.

01:57:34.215 --> 01:57:36.435
[SPEAKER_09]: Place vote now.

01:57:36.535 --> 01:57:40.056
[SPEAKER_09]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

01:57:40.096 --> 01:57:43.477
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you don't understand what I'm saying there, I'll type it in chat for you guys right now.

01:57:44.397 --> 01:57:45.917
[SPEAKER_09]: OrangeNotesRadio.com, click on chat.

01:57:46.277 --> 01:57:49.738
[SPEAKER_09]: In the meantime, Loki, how about that Sim scene?

01:57:50.757 --> 01:57:51.679
[SPEAKER_07]: DDR UK was shut down

01:57:59.605 --> 01:58:00.506
[SPEAKER_07]: Why it was shut down?

01:58:00.646 --> 01:58:01.367
[SPEAKER_07]: Voluntarily.

01:58:01.847 --> 01:58:03.669
[SPEAKER_07]: And here is why voluntarily.

01:58:04.070 --> 01:58:15.461
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the UK equivalent of the RIAA came after them and says, Currently the site has been placed into a temporary state of closure.

01:58:15.481 --> 01:58:23.409
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a direct response to communication from the IFPI in regards to a variety of links and files that were available from the site.

01:58:23.829 --> 01:58:28.676
[SPEAKER_07]: No direct legal action is being raised and this action has been voluntarily undertaken.

01:58:29.116 --> 01:58:31.419
[SPEAKER_07]: We hope for normal service to resume soon.

01:58:31.920 --> 01:58:34.023
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, there's a little bit more to go along with that.

01:58:35.725 --> 01:58:38.208
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently this was posted in...

01:58:39.623 --> 01:58:41.745
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:58:59.239 --> 01:59:02.341
[SPEAKER_07]: I do know, well, the site was taken down voluntarily.

01:59:02.421 --> 01:59:03.802
[SPEAKER_07]: They haven't, you know, pressed charges.

01:59:03.862 --> 01:59:08.484
[SPEAKER_07]: It's due to response for the official files that were on there.

01:59:08.864 --> 01:59:12.046
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, obviously they got in trouble for that.

01:59:12.866 --> 01:59:14.727
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's the link here?

01:59:17.149 --> 01:59:17.649
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

01:59:20.110 --> 01:59:21.971
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, there were some other interesting things on that.

01:59:22.391 --> 01:59:24.833
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I wish I could really find this.

01:59:26.533 --> 01:59:27.194
[SPEAKER_07]: Where is it?

01:59:31.147 --> 01:59:36.613
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, it's basically they got the logs of everyone that downloaded that crap.

01:59:36.873 --> 01:59:42.859
[SPEAKER_07]: So they don't know what exactly that's going to entail as far as all the people that downloaded this stuff.

01:59:45.161 --> 01:59:47.063
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, whether they're going to get in trouble or whatnot.

01:59:47.443 --> 01:59:49.185
[SPEAKER_07]: Lucky for me, I don't download off that site.

01:59:49.225 --> 01:59:51.968
[SPEAKER_07]: At least none of the official stuff and not from there.

01:59:53.149 --> 01:59:54.871
[SPEAKER_07]: Now the other thing though, which was interesting...

01:59:56.356 --> 02:00:03.819
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and this is in regards to, um, but my style, they're talking about taking down their sim file, um, I think too.

02:00:03.939 --> 02:00:04.339
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.

02:00:04.799 --> 02:00:06.020
[SPEAKER_07]: I, no, that's not it.

02:00:07.060 --> 02:00:11.382
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and basically, you know, the same reasons, oh, okay, here we go.

02:00:11.542 --> 02:00:13.863
[SPEAKER_07]: The DDRUK legal proceedings fact.

02:00:14.363 --> 02:00:15.443
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, what happened to the site?

02:00:15.463 --> 02:00:21.866
[SPEAKER_07]: DDRUK was recently contacted by the IFPI regarding legally held music recordings being distributed on the site.

02:00:22.026 --> 02:00:24.987
[SPEAKER_07]: The recordings in question were the official sim files from Konami's

02:00:25.627 --> 02:00:26.868
[SPEAKER_07]: Dance Dance Revolution Game.

02:00:27.028 --> 02:00:27.768
[SPEAKER_07]: How'd they find out?

02:00:27.808 --> 02:00:29.029
[SPEAKER_07]: Officially, we do not know.

02:00:30.270 --> 02:00:35.033
[SPEAKER_07]: Unofficially, the AFPI website allows anonymous reporting of copyright infringement.

02:00:35.093 --> 02:00:44.398
[SPEAKER_07]: Since the downloads are only accessible by registered members, it is likely a DDRUK site member contacted the AFPI and gave them details of the files being stored.

02:00:45.859 --> 02:00:48.421
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh, they must have banned somebody and they didn't like that.

02:00:50.566 --> 02:00:52.147
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, what's going to happen to the site?

02:00:52.187 --> 02:00:53.287
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now we do not know.

02:00:53.367 --> 02:00:57.749
[SPEAKER_07]: Myst is currently unreachable and is currently in discussions.

02:00:58.709 --> 02:01:02.530
[SPEAKER_07]: The site is down for the moment and is likely to remain that way until a later date.

02:01:03.191 --> 02:01:04.171
[SPEAKER_07]: Currently unconfirmed.

02:01:04.911 --> 02:01:07.932
[SPEAKER_07]: Is Myst facing a fine or jail time?

02:01:07.952 --> 02:01:09.073
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the guy that runs the site.

02:01:09.853 --> 02:01:13.515
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Myst has given full cooperation with the authorities.

02:01:13.575 --> 02:01:14.615
[SPEAKER_07]: They have requested that...

02:01:15.442 --> 02:01:16.283
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching.

02:01:35.185 --> 02:01:36.747
[SPEAKER_07]: He is avoiding any punitive action.

02:01:37.167 --> 02:01:38.508
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what will happen to the users.

02:01:38.848 --> 02:01:43.352
[SPEAKER_07]: This we do not know, aside from the fact that Myst has complied with the request.

02:01:43.772 --> 02:01:47.835
[SPEAKER_07]: We do not know what action, if any, the AFPI intend to take.

02:01:49.056 --> 02:01:51.638
[SPEAKER_07]: And this will be updated as they know more.

02:01:53.400 --> 02:01:57.283
[SPEAKER_09]: Comment from the chatroom, coming from Same, says that fact is fake.

02:01:58.092 --> 02:02:03.813
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm sorry, but I tend to agree, because I wouldn't believe a goddamn thing I would read on the GameFAQs message boards.

02:02:05.133 --> 02:02:05.613
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, whatever.

02:02:05.673 --> 02:02:12.815
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, all we know... Well, here's the thing that also was suspicious of me, is the BitTorrent files, they aren't on that server.

02:02:12.895 --> 02:02:18.796
[SPEAKER_07]: They're on DRAmerica.com, which also got shut down, but that's another thing entirely.

02:02:19.536 --> 02:02:21.736
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is just a scare tactic, honestly.

02:02:21.916 --> 02:02:24.037
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't... I mean, come on, people.

02:02:24.617 --> 02:02:25.357
[SPEAKER_09]: It's freaking...

02:02:26.061 --> 02:02:27.802
[SPEAKER_09]: DDR SIM files.

02:02:28.162 --> 02:02:30.342
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not even often the full songs.

02:02:30.402 --> 02:02:32.663
[SPEAKER_09]: They're little cut-down versions of these full songs.

02:02:33.483 --> 02:02:42.987
[SPEAKER_09]: If they were really going to do lawsuits against the users of DDR UK, don't you think everybody that's ever used Supernova would be extremely fucked right about now?

02:02:43.567 --> 02:02:47.608
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, seriously, you could have downloaded way more stuff.

02:02:47.688 --> 02:02:49.249
[SPEAKER_09]: Full CDs off Supernova.

02:02:49.409 --> 02:02:49.809
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.

02:02:50.205 --> 02:02:54.106
[SPEAKER_19]: Some of us still download full CDs off of ByTorrent.com

02:03:11.457 --> 02:03:20.955
[SPEAKER_31]: But even if they're trying to catch us or anything like that, we can always file back a counter-lawsuit for invading our privacy and stuff.

02:03:22.978 --> 02:03:27.141
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why... I think you're more just getting into international messiness.

02:03:27.161 --> 02:03:27.921
[SPEAKER_31]: Bullshit, though.

02:03:27.961 --> 02:03:28.402
[SPEAKER_31]: Seriously.

02:03:28.562 --> 02:03:29.963
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's just international messiness.

02:03:30.103 --> 02:03:32.044
[SPEAKER_09]: I think somebody's pulling your leg over on GameFAQs.

02:03:32.124 --> 02:03:32.785
[SPEAKER_09]: I honestly do.

02:03:32.825 --> 02:03:33.865
[SPEAKER_31]: RIAA crap.

02:03:33.885 --> 02:03:45.894
[SPEAKER_09]: They lost the lawsuit with the MP3s and shit, so... I mean, because when you get into the international stuff, because Canada was upheld in court that the people sharing files were protected in Canada.

02:03:46.314 --> 02:03:50.056
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you're a Canadian user that downloaded off of DDRUK, you'll get off scot-free.

02:03:50.076 --> 02:03:52.338
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you're an American user, hey, you're going to be screwed.

02:03:52.955 --> 02:03:53.235
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

02:03:53.396 --> 02:03:53.676
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

02:03:55.478 --> 02:03:57.660
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's the IPA, it's not the RIA.

02:03:58.060 --> 02:04:02.364
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, as I was mentioning, dancing character, I have to show Rob.

02:04:02.444 --> 02:04:04.426
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously this is not good radio because you can't see it.

02:04:05.087 --> 02:04:07.910
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is something you would think I would have made.

02:04:08.170 --> 02:04:15.177
[SPEAKER_07]: But I didn't make it, so... So anyways...

02:04:18.092 --> 02:04:18.552
[SPEAKER_26]: Lovely.

02:04:18.732 --> 02:04:20.412
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, a description for those at home.

02:04:20.713 --> 02:04:25.694
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, somebody has created a DDR character for Stepmania that is a naked girl.

02:04:25.754 --> 02:04:26.754
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, a topless girl.

02:04:27.514 --> 02:04:33.415
[SPEAKER_09]: And her boobs in full glory, and wearing tight little panty bottoms or something she's got there.

02:04:33.735 --> 02:04:34.575
[SPEAKER_09]: Little skirt bottom.

02:04:34.935 --> 02:04:38.496
[SPEAKER_09]: What is the name of this character, and where can the little boys who want to masturbate to it down?

02:04:38.776 --> 02:04:39.436
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I love that!

02:04:39.596 --> 02:04:41.877
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you see on the upskirt cam, you could see her little...

02:04:42.987 --> 02:04:45.089
[SPEAKER_09]: Poonani on the little obscure cam, did you see that?

02:04:45.369 --> 02:04:48.012
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a little dark spot in the shape of a triangle.

02:04:48.272 --> 02:04:50.514
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, where can the boys get this?

02:04:51.615 --> 02:04:57.761
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's been taken down due to, I guess, bandwidth issues.

02:04:58.342 --> 02:05:04.048
[SPEAKER_07]: But, it can be found...

02:05:05.317 --> 02:05:10.519
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a thread on DDR Freak in the sim file section that you could find this.

02:05:11.100 --> 02:05:28.287
[SPEAKER_07]: I luckily searched Google and in a cache page I found the link here, which I will later post to, I'll post the link in OrangeLodgeRadio.com where you can find it, which I'll upload to my site or something.

02:05:29.454 --> 02:05:35.377
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the first thing I noticed is that you could see her cootie box when it was going up the skirt there.

02:05:37.018 --> 02:05:39.239
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't believe you guys missed it.

02:05:39.779 --> 02:05:41.940
[SPEAKER_09]: Now Jamie's even got that curious look on her face.

02:05:46.663 --> 02:05:47.123
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

02:05:48.064 --> 02:05:48.904
[SPEAKER_19]: That's ridiculous.

02:05:49.744 --> 02:05:51.465
[SPEAKER_18]: Where is my pantsless rage?

02:05:52.506 --> 02:05:53.186
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously.

02:05:53.726 --> 02:05:55.067
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's our pantsless rage?

02:05:55.267 --> 02:05:56.168
[SPEAKER_09]: Our boy dancers.

02:05:58.209 --> 02:05:58.549
[SPEAKER_09]: Pervs.

02:06:00.168 --> 02:06:01.549
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, enough of that.

02:06:02.470 --> 02:06:04.971
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember where I got it, but some guy made it.

02:06:05.332 --> 02:06:18.201
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm sure if you look over in, if you search for like black, oh is it Stepmania character, or it's like, I don't remember, it's just whatever they posted in the one thread.

02:06:18.881 --> 02:06:28.848
[SPEAKER_07]: I found it pretty easy, but I will post a link, it will be in our forums to where you can find the wonderful Stepmania character.

02:06:30.879 --> 02:06:34.782
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:07:00.134 --> 02:07:00.974
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what else to say.

02:07:01.495 --> 02:07:03.355
[SPEAKER_09]: You're still giggling over there, Explicit.

02:07:03.715 --> 02:07:08.317
[SPEAKER_09]: You're like a little 12-year-old boy who just saw boobies on the TV for the first time on HBO.

02:07:09.838 --> 02:07:11.038
[SPEAKER_16]: Dude, change to Channel 9.

02:07:11.079 --> 02:07:12.159
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a breast exam, girl.

02:07:16.421 --> 02:07:17.781
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, this brings up a good topic.

02:07:18.201 --> 02:07:19.482
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to go around the room.

02:07:21.163 --> 02:07:24.224
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have to participate if you don't want to.

02:07:24.844 --> 02:07:28.986
[SPEAKER_09]: But I want to talk about the first time you ever saw the naughty bits of the opposite gender.

02:07:35.913 --> 02:07:36.634
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura?

02:07:42.339 --> 02:07:48.304
[SPEAKER_19]: This is kind of embarrassing, but there was a kid I played with in my neighborhood and I was nine.

02:07:48.964 --> 02:07:51.747
[SPEAKER_18]: And he thought that one day it would be funny to pull down his pants.

02:07:53.688 --> 02:07:55.630
[SPEAKER_18]: And I told his mommy and got him spanked.

02:08:00.919 --> 02:08:01.439
[SPEAKER_19]: That's hot.

02:08:01.600 --> 02:08:02.941
[SPEAKER_19]: It was our next door neighbor.

02:08:04.402 --> 02:08:08.045
[SPEAKER_19]: This is when I used to run around carrying my gizmo everywhere.

02:08:08.305 --> 02:08:09.266
[SPEAKER_19]: My little gremlins doll.

02:08:10.226 --> 02:08:10.987
[SPEAKER_05]: Gizmo, huh?

02:08:11.307 --> 02:08:13.289
[SPEAKER_19]: You need to shut up, okay?

02:08:14.250 --> 02:08:20.455
[SPEAKER_19]: But seriously, that was my first exposure and I thought it was incredibly stupid.

02:08:23.617 --> 02:08:23.937
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright.

02:08:24.078 --> 02:08:28.221
[SPEAKER_19]: My mommy... My mom had no idea how to explain to me.

02:08:28.241 --> 02:08:29.382
[SPEAKER_19]: I was...

02:08:31.948 --> 02:08:36.812
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, Mel B. You guys don't have to participate.

02:08:36.832 --> 02:08:38.093
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just talking to whoever's got the mic.

02:08:38.313 --> 02:08:40.575
[SPEAKER_35]: First time seeing live Naughty Bits, man.

02:08:41.556 --> 02:08:43.937
[SPEAKER_35]: I mean, okay, like, all media aside.

02:08:45.118 --> 02:08:45.559
[SPEAKER_35]: Gosh.

02:08:47.060 --> 02:08:47.440
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't know.

02:08:47.500 --> 02:08:54.826
[SPEAKER_35]: I think by the time I had, like, seen live ones, I'd been so desensitized by all the porn that my dad, like, hid underneath his bed and, like, in the cabinets.

02:08:55.366 --> 02:08:58.028
[SPEAKER_35]: It really wasn't anything new to me other than, like,

02:08:58.593 --> 02:09:00.133
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay, it's about time I saw this live.

02:09:00.153 --> 02:09:01.374
[SPEAKER_35]: You know, it's 3D and...

02:09:02.054 --> 02:09:02.134
[SPEAKER_09]: 3D?!

02:09:02.154 --> 02:09:08.036
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, it was like... They didn't have any of that rad 70s porn with the glasses?

02:09:09.836 --> 02:09:14.638
[SPEAKER_35]: No, and there weren't any cool, like, you know, rainbows in the background or, like, you know, little stars flying around.

02:09:14.658 --> 02:09:26.221
[SPEAKER_35]: I mean, but... I guess it was a treat to see, like, you know, nice little shadows and, like, things just... Wow, there's texture to them and... Whoa, they're cold or... Wow, it's... It was...

02:09:27.959 --> 02:09:33.262
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah, the first time I ever seen him was in my truck and it was in the back of the cab and it was a very cold night.

02:09:34.403 --> 02:09:35.763
[SPEAKER_35]: We had to keep each other warm somehow.

02:09:38.505 --> 02:09:39.765
[SPEAKER_09]: Anybody else care to go explicit?

02:09:40.626 --> 02:09:47.349
[SPEAKER_31]: If coming out of your mom's vagina counts... Not quite there, buddy.

02:09:47.369 --> 02:09:52.752
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, I was one years old.

02:09:53.487 --> 02:09:56.990
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, I don't even remember what the hell happened when I was one.

02:09:57.130 --> 02:09:59.511
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, let's go the year when I was three years old.

02:10:01.593 --> 02:10:06.717
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, I come to the bathroom, someone rushes to the shower, naked.

02:10:06.737 --> 02:10:10.359
[SPEAKER_31]: I was like, holy shit, what is this?

02:10:10.599 --> 02:10:11.560
[SPEAKER_31]: And what does hair grow down there?

02:10:11.580 --> 02:10:12.561
[SPEAKER_31]: Wow, this is getting interesting.

02:10:12.581 --> 02:10:14.182
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay.

02:10:23.410 --> 02:10:24.811
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I really want to bring up this topic?

02:10:24.891 --> 02:10:25.231
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

02:10:25.271 --> 02:10:27.593
[SPEAKER_31]: Hey, you're the one who brought it.

02:10:27.633 --> 02:10:28.013
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

02:10:28.473 --> 02:10:31.135
[SPEAKER_09]: I dated girls in high school, and that's how I saw boobs.

02:10:31.515 --> 02:10:33.797
[SPEAKER_09]: Really, it wasn't any surprise.

02:10:34.057 --> 02:10:36.339
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Mel, you'd seen it on TV enough times.

02:10:36.379 --> 02:10:38.420
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just like, oh, now I've got them live and in person.

02:10:39.140 --> 02:10:40.501
[SPEAKER_09]: But really, sad enough.

02:10:41.482 --> 02:10:44.264
[SPEAKER_09]: But now, remember, ladies, I'm gay.

02:10:45.384 --> 02:10:50.628
[SPEAKER_09]: But the first time I saw the lower equator was actually at a strip bar.

02:10:52.318 --> 02:10:52.838
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:11:13.120 --> 02:11:13.640
[SPEAKER_07]: This is easy.

02:11:15.562 --> 02:11:18.184
[SPEAKER_07]: I assume this is the first time live.

02:11:18.645 --> 02:11:20.286
[SPEAKER_07]: It was 6th grade.

02:11:20.366 --> 02:11:31.095
[SPEAKER_07]: They were doing presentations in my class for... We were studying Roman history or something like that.

02:11:31.175 --> 02:11:32.116
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it wasn't Roman history.

02:11:32.136 --> 02:11:32.677
[SPEAKER_07]: We were reading...

02:11:34.969 --> 02:11:40.753
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we were reading, like, I want to say it was like, not Julius Caesar, no.

02:11:42.834 --> 02:11:43.974
[SPEAKER_07]: Something to do with Greek and Romans.

02:11:43.995 --> 02:11:45.635
[SPEAKER_07]: We were studying, like, history or something.

02:11:46.296 --> 02:11:51.639
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was a presentation being done in the class, and, you know, people were dressing up for the part.

02:11:51.739 --> 02:12:04.567
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this one chick, she wasn't too smart, so she didn't wear anything underneath it, and she was up on a chair, like, reciting something, and she got down off the chair, stepped on her toga, and the whole thing just came off.

02:12:09.105 --> 02:12:10.106
[SPEAKER_07]: All in front of the class.

02:12:12.848 --> 02:12:13.748
[SPEAKER_19]: How educational.

02:12:14.269 --> 02:12:14.649
[SPEAKER_08]: It was.

02:12:18.952 --> 02:12:19.292
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

02:12:20.353 --> 02:12:20.733
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

02:12:21.874 --> 02:12:24.115
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, we're supposed to talk about games on this show.

02:12:24.195 --> 02:12:25.036
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

02:12:25.136 --> 02:12:25.776
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so sorry.

02:12:27.818 --> 02:12:29.159
[SPEAKER_09]: Games that little kids play.

02:12:31.921 --> 02:12:32.281
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

02:12:32.614 --> 02:12:33.774
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to a break, guys.

02:12:34.014 --> 02:12:36.095
[SPEAKER_09]: When we come back from the break, we're going to do the FUs of the week.

02:12:36.115 --> 02:12:40.316
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to talk about who won the cage match and who knows, whatever else we feel like.

02:12:40.877 --> 02:12:44.058
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to do whatever the hell we please, basically, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:12:44.518 --> 02:12:45.758
[SPEAKER_09]: So you just be ready for it.

02:12:46.919 --> 02:12:48.539
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be back after this.

02:12:49.379 --> 02:12:53.621
[SPEAKER_09]: I decided we'd do a break of some DDR songs, some pretty well-known DDR songs.

02:12:53.961 --> 02:12:57.382
[SPEAKER_09]: And just for Jamie, I made the first song by Taku.

02:12:58.478 --> 02:12:59.821
[SPEAKER_09]: and it's one we haven't played in a while.

02:13:00.182 --> 02:13:02.587
[SPEAKER_09]: So starting it off we have Era starting off this mix.

02:13:03.028 --> 02:13:03.429
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be back.

02:13:52.456 --> 02:13:53.417
Thanks for watching!

02:14:43.696 --> 02:14:45.058
Thanks for watching!

02:16:36.449 --> 02:16:37.770
Thanks for watching!

02:18:19.659 --> 02:18:28.285
[SPEAKER_12]: Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.

02:18:34.189 --> 02:18:36.550
[SPEAKER_09]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:18:36.590 --> 02:18:37.871
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you guys for sticking with us.

02:18:37.911 --> 02:18:39.612
[SPEAKER_09]: We're getting into the last hour of the show here.

02:18:39.652 --> 02:18:43.815
[SPEAKER_09]: We have plenty of stuff coming up, including some favorite segments you've come to know and love.

02:18:44.355 --> 02:18:48.078
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got to get one of those segments taken care of, though, and that would be the cage match.

02:18:48.138 --> 02:18:49.719
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys want to know who won tonight's cage match?

02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:53.101
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to give props to the chat room.

02:18:53.121 --> 02:18:55.362
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people voting tonight's cage match.

02:18:55.463 --> 02:18:58.044
[SPEAKER_09]: Very pleased to see a lot of participation from the chat room tonight.

02:18:58.344 --> 02:18:59.065
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what?

02:18:59.385 --> 02:19:06.890
[SPEAKER_09]: Once again, one vote separating not only the winner from the second place song, but from the third place song as well.

02:19:06.910 --> 02:19:09.132
[SPEAKER_09]: It was that freaking close tonight.

02:19:09.592 --> 02:19:10.272
[SPEAKER_09]: So here it is.

02:19:10.633 --> 02:19:13.875
[SPEAKER_09]: The winning song of tonight's cage match is...

02:19:18.276 --> 02:19:20.637
[SPEAKER_09]: Echo Image with Endless Day.

02:19:22.117 --> 02:19:23.197
[SPEAKER_09]: One more time.

02:19:24.738 --> 02:19:26.038
[SPEAKER_09]: Very, very close.

02:19:26.218 --> 02:19:28.799
[SPEAKER_09]: One vote, any other direction would have made all the difference.

02:19:29.059 --> 02:19:30.379
[SPEAKER_09]: So, very nice.

02:19:30.819 --> 02:19:32.160
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for participating, you guys.

02:19:33.020 --> 02:19:34.300
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll do it again next week.

02:19:35.060 --> 02:19:35.380
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

02:19:36.781 --> 02:19:37.221
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on.

02:19:39.161 --> 02:19:41.682
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we're kind of getting into the last hour of the show.

02:19:41.722 --> 02:19:45.524
[SPEAKER_09]: We really only have, what, FUs, Ask Orange Lounge, Left to Go, right?

02:19:45.544 --> 02:19:46.604
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the usual bits.

02:19:47.024 --> 02:19:59.229
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we get bored and we're looking for things to talk about on the show because, you know, if we don't talk about DDR, there'll be people out there that go, Man, that Orange Lounge Radio sucks!

02:20:01.360 --> 02:20:03.722
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't ever talk about DDR.

02:20:03.762 --> 02:20:07.304
[SPEAKER_11]: They talk about the first time they saw boobs or penises.

02:20:08.084 --> 02:20:09.205
[SPEAKER_11]: They're all gay.

02:20:10.085 --> 02:20:11.106
[SPEAKER_11]: What's wrong with them?

02:20:11.426 --> 02:20:15.488
[SPEAKER_16]: And you know, chat room, you're really missing something without being able to see Rob's face while he does this.

02:20:17.049 --> 02:20:18.370
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, I can talk about both at once.

02:20:18.710 --> 02:20:21.071
[SPEAKER_11]: Man, everybody at Orange Lounge Radio is gay.

02:20:21.391 --> 02:20:23.212
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a big gay station.

02:20:23.272 --> 02:20:24.733
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything about it is gay.

02:20:25.794 --> 02:20:26.574
[SPEAKER_31]: You mean unhappy?

02:20:26.594 --> 02:20:26.674
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah.

02:20:31.368 --> 02:20:32.829
[SPEAKER_09]: Where is that rainbow cake, man?

02:20:33.450 --> 02:20:35.472
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, how fruity.

02:20:35.812 --> 02:20:43.839
[SPEAKER_09]: In an effort to warm ourselves up more to the DDR community, we seek inspiration from posts from DDR Freak.

02:20:46.060 --> 02:20:47.381
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, God, no.

02:20:48.943 --> 02:20:49.663
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

02:20:50.604 --> 02:20:53.647
[SPEAKER_10]: It's time for the DDR Chit Chat Post of the Week.

02:20:54.027 --> 02:20:54.768
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, my God.

02:20:58.280 --> 02:21:05.624
[SPEAKER_09]: Since we are syndicated now on DDR Freak Radio, we've got to give a shout out to our fellow friends over at DDR Freak.

02:21:06.565 --> 02:21:11.908
[SPEAKER_09]: We're working together with the Freak by stealing one of their topics for one of our own.

02:21:11.968 --> 02:21:15.330
[SPEAKER_10]: So here it is, the DDR topic of the week.

02:21:16.951 --> 02:21:19.672
[SPEAKER_09]: Here it is, guys, and you all are going to have to answer this.

02:21:20.012 --> 02:21:20.373
[SPEAKER_09]: Here it is.

02:21:21.673 --> 02:21:23.054
[SPEAKER_09]: Subject of message.

02:21:24.215 --> 02:21:26.276
[SPEAKER_09]: What are tournaments like?

02:21:28.311 --> 02:21:33.174
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell on Earth Hell on Earth And you don't eat all day Now we're talking about DDR tournaments

02:21:48.911 --> 02:21:50.412
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm talking about DDR tournaments too.

02:21:51.533 --> 02:21:52.134
[SPEAKER_09]: Now wait a minute though.

02:21:52.154 --> 02:21:57.979
[SPEAKER_09]: There was the one tournament we had in Sacramento where Lanky Style and Rice Princess were running the kitchen with deep fried Twinkies.

02:21:59.200 --> 02:22:00.041
[SPEAKER_19]: I had half of one.

02:22:00.421 --> 02:22:01.642
[SPEAKER_09]: So you did get to eat that day.

02:22:02.263 --> 02:22:03.684
[SPEAKER_19]: That's all I needed to eat all day.

02:22:06.246 --> 02:22:06.886
[SPEAKER_09]: Explicit.

02:22:07.347 --> 02:22:08.768
[SPEAKER_09]: What are DDR tournaments like?

02:22:09.269 --> 02:22:12.071
[SPEAKER_31]: Heaven or hell.

02:22:12.091 --> 02:22:15.314
[SPEAKER_31]: The good thing about tournaments is of course you get to meet with a lot of people.

02:22:16.320 --> 02:22:21.883
[SPEAKER_31]: Chitchat and compete so you can feel welcome to see how your skills match up with others.

02:22:22.523 --> 02:22:24.885
[SPEAKER_31]: Are you better than everybody else or not?

02:22:25.845 --> 02:22:27.866
[SPEAKER_31]: Some tournaments actually serve food.

02:22:28.347 --> 02:22:31.368
[SPEAKER_31]: The upcoming tournament I'm organizing called Sacktown Smackdown.

02:22:31.588 --> 02:22:32.429
[SPEAKER_31]: Not piss!

02:22:33.489 --> 02:22:34.450
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't need to go back there.

02:22:35.450 --> 02:22:36.271
[SPEAKER_31]: I'll talk to you about that.

02:22:37.031 --> 02:22:38.292
[SPEAKER_09]: Talk to Mel about it another time.

02:22:38.332 --> 02:22:39.993
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not bringing that subject back up this week.

02:22:41.554 --> 02:22:42.354
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, okay.

02:22:42.374 --> 02:22:43.074
[SPEAKER_31]: Back on topic.

02:22:43.735 --> 02:22:45.796
[SPEAKER_31]: The tournament is to meet the organizers

02:22:48.071 --> 02:22:52.893
[SPEAKER_31]: and for those who are lonely, they can visit the opposite sex if that's possible.

02:22:54.293 --> 02:22:57.034
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, as for the hell part, this is where I get cranky.

02:22:57.694 --> 02:23:00.075
[SPEAKER_31]: People bitch about the fucking pads.

02:23:00.615 --> 02:23:02.516
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh wow, a pair doesn't work.

02:23:04.076 --> 02:23:05.757
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, that's too bad.

02:23:06.698 --> 02:23:09.120
[SPEAKER_31]: We only say that if it doesn't work immediately.

02:23:09.160 --> 02:23:12.922
[SPEAKER_31]: You can't have it step up no matter how many pounds of pressure you put on it.

02:23:13.723 --> 02:23:17.566
[SPEAKER_31]: But I've seen people complain because they tap it very loudly and get a miss.

02:23:18.186 --> 02:23:19.187
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh wow, you got a miss.

02:23:19.307 --> 02:23:19.727
[SPEAKER_31]: So what?

02:23:20.067 --> 02:23:20.748
[SPEAKER_31]: Focus more.

02:23:20.788 --> 02:23:21.568
[SPEAKER_31]: Don't give up.

02:23:22.849 --> 02:23:25.571
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh my god, you screwed me over on the fucking tournament.

02:23:25.831 --> 02:23:26.972
[SPEAKER_31]: Or complain about the rules.

02:23:28.193 --> 02:23:32.056
[SPEAKER_31]: And of course, you get the butt-raping drama that's been going around and shit.

02:23:32.981 --> 02:23:34.662
[SPEAKER_31]: Ooh, NorCal versus SoCal.

02:23:35.442 --> 02:23:37.763
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh wow, what big of a deal is this?

02:23:37.783 --> 02:23:39.064
[SPEAKER_09]: Seattle versus everybody.

02:23:39.644 --> 02:23:41.605
[SPEAKER_35]: NorCal versus SoCal ain't no rivalry, man.

02:23:41.625 --> 02:23:42.646
[SPEAKER_35]: Especially in freestyle.

02:23:42.886 --> 02:23:44.307
[SPEAKER_35]: That's a one-sided ass-whooping.

02:23:44.327 --> 02:23:45.107
[SPEAKER_35]: That ain't a rivalry.

02:23:45.667 --> 02:23:47.508
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh dear, oh dear, he's starting something.

02:23:47.809 --> 02:23:50.390
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, that's what I'm getting to in the freestyle section.

02:23:50.430 --> 02:23:53.391
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, freestyle is always about the opinions.

02:23:53.852 --> 02:24:01.295
[SPEAKER_31]: You can't complain and say you deserve first place or second place unless you've got something that's determined that's favoring one side or the other.

02:24:01.715 --> 02:24:02.576
[SPEAKER_31]: If that is the case...

02:24:03.069 --> 02:24:04.270
[SPEAKER_31]: They shouldn't even be judges.

02:24:04.690 --> 02:24:07.873
[SPEAKER_31]: Of course, Mel B knows what kind of tournaments those have been.

02:24:09.554 --> 02:24:11.856
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, Mel B. I gotta ask Mel B, though.

02:24:12.076 --> 02:24:18.442
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll continue to address to Mel B. Okay, Mel B, because you've won a couple tournaments, and you've had a hand in judging and putting together some.

02:24:18.982 --> 02:24:19.903
[SPEAKER_10]: What are tournaments like?

02:24:20.163 --> 02:24:20.664
[SPEAKER_10]: Payday.

02:24:25.287 --> 02:24:27.950
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Mel Ego B, everybody!

02:24:28.770 --> 02:24:31.973
[SPEAKER_35]: As far as I'm concerned, there's two things that I know when I have a good tourney.

02:24:32.372 --> 02:24:35.474
[SPEAKER_35]: I come out paid, and when I'm done back home, there are panties on my drawer.

02:24:39.516 --> 02:24:42.437
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't know, it's kind of hard to say.

02:24:42.837 --> 02:24:47.940
[SPEAKER_35]: Obviously, if we're going back about five years ago, tournaments were a big thing.

02:24:48.560 --> 02:24:52.703
[SPEAKER_35]: We were trying to promote the game, we were trying to get people aware of this.

02:24:54.472 --> 02:24:55.973
[SPEAKER_35]: No, I mean, we took tournaments seriously.

02:24:56.013 --> 02:25:02.576
[SPEAKER_35]: We figured, you know, we had to put our best foot forward to make this game look good and say like, hey, this is something everyone can enjoy and all that good stuff.

02:25:02.776 --> 02:25:04.677
[SPEAKER_35]: And so it was sort of fun.

02:25:04.717 --> 02:25:06.798
[SPEAKER_35]: But when I got to my first tournament, I won.

02:25:06.838 --> 02:25:10.320
[SPEAKER_35]: And like by that, I think that just kind of like maybe see tournaments a whole different way.

02:25:10.340 --> 02:25:11.780
[SPEAKER_35]: Like I had to go out there and I had to win.

02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:16.082
[SPEAKER_35]: I wasn't out there to, I mean, yeah, I was out there to have fun and, you know, socialize and promote it.

02:25:16.122 --> 02:25:22.285
[SPEAKER_35]: But when all was said and done, I didn't drive down five hours to LA to be second place or to be, you know, to have a good show.

02:25:22.485 --> 02:25:23.066
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, snap.

02:25:23.086 --> 02:25:23.666
[SPEAKER_35]: Screw that.

02:25:24.093 --> 02:25:48.637
[SPEAKER_35]: but um so yeah after all you know tourneys you know yeah I got bigger prizes got my solo machine got my poppin music controller at the last tourney which is pretty dope by the way thank you desktop arcade um I would say as far as organizing a tourney those things are not fun yeah organizers are not that great I think perfect tech tourneys are fucking boring as hell because it's I mean it's

02:25:50.227 --> 02:26:19.431
[SPEAKER_35]: yeah there's just basically nothing new you can put to PA I mean yeah you can put on different modifiers but then it's like you're not really gauging someone's perfect attack ability you're gauging their improv you know their sight reading more or less which is not a bad thing I mean it's something that should be tested but at the same time it's kind of just kind of gone to the wayside it's boring in my opinion at least with freestyle there's that chance you can see something new and something cool but tournaments are pretty fun if you just don't hang around the venue too long

02:26:21.496 --> 02:26:31.240
[SPEAKER_09]: DDR Tournaments for me, DDR Tournaments for me are about bringing a lot of Febreze and a super soaker to give some of these kids a bath.

02:26:32.300 --> 02:26:32.820
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm kidding.

02:26:33.320 --> 02:26:33.821
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I'm not.

02:26:33.861 --> 02:26:42.584
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, DDR Tournaments, it's all about community to me, and I could give a shit about who's winning the tournament, and I've participated in tournaments, and I've lost big.

02:26:42.904 --> 02:26:45.465
[SPEAKER_09]: I've done decent in some as well, but...

02:26:46.337 --> 02:26:51.919
[SPEAKER_09]: To me, yes, to me it's about making people know who I am.

02:26:54.280 --> 02:27:01.683
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll tell you what, after the March Madness where we had DDR Idol, you know who I am.

02:27:05.806 --> 02:27:08.249
[SPEAKER_09]: It's about making your DDR penis as big as possible.

02:27:08.269 --> 02:27:10.872
[SPEAKER_31]: We need to do DDR Idol again.

02:27:10.912 --> 02:27:14.856
[SPEAKER_31]: Are you actually going to come back?

02:27:14.896 --> 02:27:16.318
[SPEAKER_09]: The good doctor's thinking about it.

02:27:16.338 --> 02:27:19.001
[SPEAKER_09]: You just need something to get him out of the closet again.

02:27:20.242 --> 02:27:25.548
[SPEAKER_31]: Remember in my tournament, you get to improv with a prop.

02:27:27.672 --> 02:27:28.092
[SPEAKER_31]: Think about it.

02:27:28.252 --> 02:27:30.593
[SPEAKER_31]: That's a new thing I'm putting up for freestyle.

02:27:30.673 --> 02:27:31.333
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds pretty hot.

02:27:31.353 --> 02:27:33.213
[SPEAKER_31]: Improvision with a prop.

02:27:33.793 --> 02:27:35.114
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll talk to the good doctor about it.

02:27:35.134 --> 02:27:35.954
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see what he comes up with.

02:27:36.054 --> 02:27:43.215
[SPEAKER_35]: Or you're probably saving up for DDR History X. I don't want to beat the Dr. Dick thing into the ground, though.

02:27:44.116 --> 02:27:45.416
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm only going to use him on a rainy day.

02:27:45.916 --> 02:27:47.356
[SPEAKER_31]: How can you not?

02:27:49.257 --> 02:27:49.637
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

02:27:49.697 --> 02:27:50.037
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

02:27:50.617 --> 02:27:50.897
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

02:27:51.617 --> 02:27:53.438
[SPEAKER_09]: Shark Scroll, anything you wanted to add to this discussion?

02:27:54.218 --> 02:27:55.298
[SPEAKER_16]: What is a tournament like?

02:27:55.888 --> 02:27:56.088
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

02:27:56.308 --> 02:27:56.769
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

02:27:57.169 --> 02:27:58.010
[SPEAKER_16]: Find my friends.

02:27:58.110 --> 02:27:59.110
[SPEAKER_16]: Jabber, jabber, jabber.

02:27:59.170 --> 02:28:00.051
[SPEAKER_16]: Have they started yet?

02:28:00.491 --> 02:28:01.212
[SPEAKER_16]: Jabber, jabber, jabber.

02:28:01.252 --> 02:28:01.652
[SPEAKER_16]: Another hour.

02:28:01.692 --> 02:28:02.653
[SPEAKER_16]: Have they started yet?

02:28:02.773 --> 02:28:03.634
[SPEAKER_16]: Jabber, jabber, jabber.

02:28:04.254 --> 02:28:05.095
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, there's a routine.

02:28:05.135 --> 02:28:05.655
[SPEAKER_16]: Who's on?

02:28:06.336 --> 02:28:07.437
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, we just missed the entire thing.

02:28:07.517 --> 02:28:07.737
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, well.

02:28:08.718 --> 02:28:09.078
[SPEAKER_16]: That's it.

02:28:10.579 --> 02:28:14.302
[SPEAKER_16]: And most of the time it involves doing something completely unrelated to DDR, like actually mini-golfing.

02:28:14.482 --> 02:28:18.084
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, SharkScroll and I met for the first time at a DDR tournament.

02:28:19.365 --> 02:28:20.346
[SPEAKER_09]: Just jabber, jabber, jabber.

02:28:20.766 --> 02:28:21.207
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

02:28:21.227 --> 02:28:24.009
[SPEAKER_09]: Because DarkSakura and I were pissed that we screwed up on PA.

02:28:24.759 --> 02:28:28.140
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I met you before the PA, because I remember you guys went to go get the bats.

02:28:28.921 --> 02:28:30.381
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah!

02:28:30.481 --> 02:28:31.401
[SPEAKER_09]: And the toy horns.

02:28:31.501 --> 02:28:36.043
[SPEAKER_09]: But I remember we screwed up on PA so bad, and we got your input on what we should do for the freestyle.

02:28:36.063 --> 02:28:45.046
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, like, me, DarkSakura, IguanaGirl, I remember we all went to the Rite Aid, and we got the bats, and we did the Stomp to My Beat routine, which was the best routine I was ever a part of, by the way.

02:28:46.387 --> 02:28:50.708
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, the funny thing is, I remember when I met you, and I know I've told you this, but I'll tell the entire world this.

02:28:51.008 --> 02:28:52.889
[SPEAKER_16]: My first two thoughts when I met Rob...

02:28:53.416 --> 02:28:54.337
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow, he's hot.

02:28:54.637 --> 02:28:55.578
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow, he's gay.

02:28:56.478 --> 02:28:58.700
[SPEAKER_16]: In that order, at that speed.

02:28:58.800 --> 02:28:59.240
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

02:29:00.141 --> 02:29:00.761
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, honey.

02:29:06.005 --> 02:29:06.605
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm blushing.

02:29:07.706 --> 02:29:08.207
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop, girl.

02:29:08.567 --> 02:29:10.828
[SPEAKER_09]: See, this is about tournaments being good for my ego.

02:29:11.289 --> 02:29:13.951
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, Loki, anything you want to add about DDR tournaments?

02:29:17.893 --> 02:29:21.476
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they're long and boring.

02:29:23.638 --> 02:29:24.878
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's my take on them.

02:29:25.819 --> 02:29:29.440
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, um, watching Titanic.

02:29:31.580 --> 02:29:46.765
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like you keep expecting something, you keep expecting something cool to happen, and someone says that there's something really good about it, but you just don't see it no matter how long you watch it, and after you're done, you want your three hours back.

02:29:46.865 --> 02:29:49.146
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's pretty much, you know...

02:29:51.480 --> 02:30:00.102
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and you know, you expect something major to happen, like Leonardo DiCaprio to die, but then you find out he just was acting, so.

02:30:02.923 --> 02:30:05.103
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, you know, we're all shocked to find out the boat sinks.

02:30:05.864 --> 02:30:06.404
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh my!

02:30:07.744 --> 02:30:09.244
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for ruining it for me, Rob!

02:30:09.264 --> 02:30:14.206
[SPEAKER_07]: Something completely unexpected happens, like the same people winning the tournaments all the time.

02:30:14.826 --> 02:30:16.066
[SPEAKER_07]: That's wonderful.

02:30:18.527 --> 02:30:19.027
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all right.

02:30:20.188 --> 02:30:21.528
[SPEAKER_09]: The doctor's going to make a comeback.

02:30:21.568 --> 02:30:22.149
[SPEAKER_09]: Just you wait.

02:30:23.549 --> 02:30:23.870
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

02:30:23.950 --> 02:30:25.550
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, let's move on.

02:30:26.051 --> 02:30:28.532
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was our DDR Freak post of the week.

02:30:28.752 --> 02:30:29.252
[SPEAKER_09]: There you have it.

02:30:29.352 --> 02:30:31.833
[SPEAKER_09]: Our DDR Chit Chat post of the week.

02:30:31.973 --> 02:30:34.635
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep posting over in DDR Freak on the DDR Chit Chat boards.

02:30:34.975 --> 02:30:41.138
[SPEAKER_09]: Your post, if it's interesting enough, could be fodder for this show.

02:30:41.378 --> 02:30:41.638
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

02:30:42.096 --> 02:30:47.178
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on, let's get into the FUs of the week.

02:30:47.618 --> 02:30:51.319
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, why is it that we have to do these FUs every single week?

02:30:51.480 --> 02:30:54.000
[SPEAKER_19]: Because life is a big stinking pile of shit.

02:30:55.121 --> 02:31:00.463
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, this is bad.

02:31:02.184 --> 02:31:02.964
[SPEAKER_28]: Here is justice.

02:31:10.365 --> 02:31:14.328
[SPEAKER_19]: An FU goes toward the entirety of my week since Wednesday.

02:31:15.168 --> 02:31:18.310
[SPEAKER_19]: For getting three hours of sleep in as many days.

02:31:20.671 --> 02:31:23.633
[SPEAKER_19]: For being an emotional wreck for the past few days.

02:31:25.094 --> 02:31:29.477
[SPEAKER_19]: An FU to basically almost having to go find my own damn apartment.

02:31:31.878 --> 02:31:37.262
[SPEAKER_19]: To being harassed by the cops at Denny's over an open confrontation.

02:31:37.282 --> 02:31:39.143
[SPEAKER_17]: To your wife.

02:31:41.185 --> 02:31:41.725
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not funny.

02:31:42.365 --> 02:31:43.065
[SPEAKER_19]: It's really serious.

02:31:44.386 --> 02:31:53.030
[SPEAKER_19]: Um... Just F you to all that, and having to compromise for a worthy cause.

02:31:54.431 --> 02:31:55.491
[SPEAKER_19]: That's it, that's all I'm gonna say.

02:31:56.972 --> 02:32:00.233
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, then we'll move on to... Loki!

02:32:03.355 --> 02:32:07.997
[SPEAKER_07]: First off, thank you to myself for having to buy another fucking hard drive for this goddamn computer.

02:32:08.615 --> 02:32:18.583
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I didn't calculate the voltage needed for these things, so... You know, one rail of the power supply would've been maxed out if I bought these other things.

02:32:18.684 --> 02:32:23.588
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, you plug in a USB anything and the computer crashes, so that would've sucked.

02:32:24.208 --> 02:32:30.934
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I got a larger hard drive out of it, now I have this really small 30 gig laptop hard drive that... I have no fucking clue what I'm gonna do with.

02:32:31.735 --> 02:32:36.879
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, fuck you, those goddamn slow people in front of me today while I was coming home.

02:32:37.628 --> 02:32:42.671
[SPEAKER_07]: You were literally driving like 20 miles an hour in 50 mile an hour area.

02:32:43.432 --> 02:32:44.773
[SPEAKER_07]: I drive by you and guess what?

02:32:44.793 --> 02:32:45.273
[SPEAKER_07]: You're old.

02:32:45.733 --> 02:32:46.534
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a shocker.

02:32:47.935 --> 02:32:55.340
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, honestly, driving slower will not get you, will not let you live longer, basically.

02:32:55.640 --> 02:32:57.241
[SPEAKER_07]: You cannot slow down time.

02:32:58.101 --> 02:33:00.903
[SPEAKER_07]: So please, drive the speed limit or faster.

02:33:01.464 --> 02:33:02.164
[SPEAKER_19]: May I add one?

02:33:03.185 --> 02:33:03.345
[SPEAKER_19]: F.U.

02:33:03.385 --> 02:33:04.886
[SPEAKER_19]: people with halogen headlights, thank you.

02:33:05.493 --> 02:33:07.135
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yes, I'd like to second that.

02:33:07.515 --> 02:33:12.919
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing that I like more than having the sun staring at me through my back window.

02:33:13.440 --> 02:33:21.647
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, because I'm glad you can see five miles in front of you, but I can't even see two feet in front of me because your lights are burning my retinas.

02:33:22.227 --> 02:33:26.671
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, but, you know, I fucking hate all these trucks with, like, fog lamps and shit on them.

02:33:27.192 --> 02:33:30.715
[SPEAKER_07]: They have so much, you know, fucking light coming out of them, I literally...

02:33:31.596 --> 02:33:36.762
[SPEAKER_07]: I can see them cutting a hole in the fog, you know, literally just evaporating right in front of them.

02:33:38.124 --> 02:33:38.744
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just nuts.

02:33:39.065 --> 02:33:42.969
[SPEAKER_07]: No wonder deers fucking, you know, get hit by cars because they stare through the headlights.

02:33:43.250 --> 02:33:44.591
[SPEAKER_07]: They, like, literally go blind.

02:33:45.032 --> 02:33:46.854
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just, like, brain shocked.

02:33:48.513 --> 02:33:49.554
[SPEAKER_07]: So that fucking sucked.

02:33:50.355 --> 02:33:55.819
[SPEAKER_07]: And just basically, you know, fuck you to this stupid Dremel attachment that I have.

02:33:55.859 --> 02:34:04.146
[SPEAKER_07]: This little flex shaft thing that supposedly allows you to use a Dremel tool in really tight places and stuff.

02:34:04.386 --> 02:34:11.633
[SPEAKER_07]: But the goddamn thing, you know, I put the bit inside of it and it threw the goddamn saw blade out at me, so that sucked.

02:34:15.103 --> 02:34:18.926
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to hear any of your giggling over a flex shaft in tight places.

02:34:22.108 --> 02:34:23.109
[SPEAKER_07]: The hell with you people.

02:34:24.751 --> 02:34:28.774
[SPEAKER_19]: You're saying about talking about putting things in tight places in this crowd.

02:34:31.701 --> 02:34:32.061
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

02:34:32.101 --> 02:34:33.722
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds like fun, girl.

02:34:35.242 --> 02:34:44.105
[SPEAKER_07]: And a Final Fantasy-related FU to this guy named Warchief, who is a complete moron, who I literally think is retarded and doesn't speak English.

02:34:44.905 --> 02:34:47.766
[SPEAKER_07]: So, way to go, retarded people.

02:34:48.046 --> 02:34:48.566
[SPEAKER_37]: Dark!

02:34:48.886 --> 02:34:50.386
[SPEAKER_37]: Final Fantasy fun!

02:34:51.047 --> 02:34:54.828
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um... Yay.

02:34:55.688 --> 02:34:56.988
[SPEAKER_07]: So, to hell with all that.

02:34:57.528 --> 02:34:59.729
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, really, it's been a pretty decent week, though.

02:35:01.721 --> 02:35:02.021
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm done.

02:35:10.268 --> 02:35:17.513
[SPEAKER_09]: An FU to my mouse that just decided to die on me so I can't control the show right now except with the keyboard.

02:35:17.913 --> 02:35:20.355
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is going to be an interesting second half of the show.

02:35:20.675 --> 02:35:24.098
[SPEAKER_09]: I've just got to go run and get the spare battery so I've got to keep my FUs kind of short.

02:35:25.459 --> 02:35:27.781
[SPEAKER_09]: FU to the Valero that just opened up.

02:35:28.882 --> 02:35:30.082
[SPEAKER_09]: Literally across the street.

02:35:30.142 --> 02:35:32.724
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you noticed, they've been building a gas station across the street.

02:35:33.144 --> 02:35:37.467
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to set this up, the Orange Lounge Studios are in the middle of fucking nowhere, okay?

02:35:37.567 --> 02:35:40.628
[SPEAKER_09]: And they just finally built a gas station, like, literally right across the street from us.

02:35:40.969 --> 02:35:42.289
[SPEAKER_09]: But now it has a mini-mart.

02:35:42.630 --> 02:35:46.032
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course these mini-marts are gonna be freaking marked up to all hell.

02:35:46.492 --> 02:35:47.893
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's so convenient!

02:35:48.393 --> 02:35:53.716
[SPEAKER_09]: So now I'm gonna end up paying, like, $5 for a 12-pack of Pepsi because, well, shit, it's right across the street.

02:35:54.196 --> 02:35:54.857
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm lazy.

02:35:56.894 --> 02:35:57.675
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, alright.

02:35:57.695 --> 02:36:00.918
[SPEAKER_09]: Continue from the previous weeks that I've not been saying FU's.

02:36:18.997 --> 02:36:23.922
[SPEAKER_31]: A big F you goes to almost everybody who keeps calling my god damn tournament Piss.

02:36:25.504 --> 02:36:29.908
[SPEAKER_31]: Just cause some people spelled it Paradise Island, Sacktown, Smackdown.

02:36:31.050 --> 02:36:32.671
[SPEAKER_31]: It doesn't mean it is called Piss.

02:36:32.731 --> 02:36:34.373
[SPEAKER_31]: Just call it Sacktown Smackdown.

02:36:36.775 --> 02:36:38.637
[SPEAKER_31]: Since when did we have a Piss attack?

02:36:40.319 --> 02:36:41.000
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm on a perfect...

02:36:41.696 --> 02:36:47.681
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't know, the first Sacramento attorney I remember was called Scat, so... That was not my idea.

02:36:49.944 --> 02:37:00.333
[SPEAKER_19]: But, on an odd enough note, I actually found two of the Scat t-shirts in my closet while looking for stuff, so maybe we'll throw it out as a prize.

02:37:03.035 --> 02:37:04.437
[SPEAKER_19]: T-shirts from the bottom of my closet.

02:37:04.477 --> 02:37:05.798
[SPEAKER_12]: The mouse is fixed, thank you.

02:37:07.799 --> 02:37:15.105
[SPEAKER_31]: Another F he goes to, someone's throwing a fucking glass, a fucking, um, slowly bottle in the fucking road again.

02:37:15.625 --> 02:37:16.626
[SPEAKER_31]: What am I supposed to do?

02:37:19.488 --> 02:37:26.213
[SPEAKER_31]: Don't fucking F. I drive, I drive back and forth every day and I see someone throw a damn bottle out of nowhere.

02:37:26.854 --> 02:37:28.295
[SPEAKER_31]: Who the hell do you think you are?

02:37:28.615 --> 02:37:31.617
[SPEAKER_31]: This is $1,000 fine if you throw anything out the window.

02:37:31.657 --> 02:37:32.178
[SPEAKER_31]: If you get caught.

02:37:36.997 --> 02:37:44.421
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, if you get caught, but it's because the cops are so lazy eating their fucking 12 donuts or Krispy Kreme donuts.

02:37:46.142 --> 02:37:50.505
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, now, don't be getting mad at cops for eating donuts.

02:37:50.585 --> 02:37:52.726
[SPEAKER_07]: They have to have breakfast just like you and me.

02:37:53.146 --> 02:37:58.710
[SPEAKER_07]: And goddammit, if they decide to frequent a donut place, then that's their god-given right.

02:38:02.510 --> 02:38:05.815
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm not going to go with the freaking donut issue.

02:38:05.895 --> 02:38:09.821
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen a cop... It's donut's fault for being so goddamn delicious.

02:38:11.043 --> 02:38:12.725
[SPEAKER_31]: And it's too damn round as well.

02:38:14.535 --> 02:38:39.015
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm not gonna go, okay, uh, let me see, another F he goes to DDRUK for shutting down, of course, he's got people trying to spy over MP3s and shit, but like I stated earlier, I said, we can always find our counter lawsuit for, for bargaining our privacy and shit, so, all is forgiven, and if not really, we beat that shit out of him,

02:38:40.714 --> 02:38:40.934
[SPEAKER_31]: Mel B!

02:38:56.630 --> 02:39:08.359
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh gosh, well, after you go to my, uh, workplace over at Navco, real smooth to have a QA department of about, oh, about maybe 60 strong or so, and have, like, six computers for all of us to use.

02:39:08.459 --> 02:39:12.242
[SPEAKER_35]: Especially when we're trying to bug, like, a really, uh, big project here.

02:39:12.842 --> 02:39:14.223
[SPEAKER_35]: Do you have Katamari Stress Balls?

02:39:14.243 --> 02:39:14.363
[SPEAKER_35]: Maybe...

02:39:44.093 --> 02:39:53.658
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah, I'm actually, funny enough, one of the people who I know at Namco, just transferred from Konami, works in the marketing division, so I'm going to try to see if she can be my hookup for stuff.

02:39:54.139 --> 02:39:57.580
[SPEAKER_35]: And she's Japanese, too, so that's a double-plot.

02:39:58.321 --> 02:40:03.544
[SPEAKER_17]: I did find out that for the LucasArts people, they get thermal nuclear detonator shuffles.

02:40:04.264 --> 02:40:08.226
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, yeah, so, yeah, happy to them.

02:40:08.486 --> 02:40:09.087
[SPEAKER_35]: Happy to...

02:40:09.980 --> 02:40:12.921
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you to myself for losing my damn keys on Friday night.

02:40:13.141 --> 02:40:17.202
[SPEAKER_35]: Apparently what happened was it ended up in Shark's girl's handbag somehow.

02:40:17.222 --> 02:40:19.603
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't know if she had a hand in this.

02:40:19.883 --> 02:40:21.923
[SPEAKER_15]: I swear to you, I had the bag on your chair.

02:40:21.943 --> 02:40:25.404
[SPEAKER_15]: You threw the keys on the chair when you walked in the door and it fell in my bag.

02:40:25.424 --> 02:40:27.745
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait, you're the responsible one.

02:40:27.765 --> 02:40:30.246
[SPEAKER_15]: You should know what you're saying.

02:40:30.326 --> 02:40:34.047
[SPEAKER_35]: So yeah, thank you to myself for just losing my keys like I always do.

02:40:34.087 --> 02:40:35.767
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank God I actually found it.

02:40:36.267 --> 02:40:38.028
[SPEAKER_35]: But that's about it.

02:40:38.655 --> 02:40:40.196
[SPEAKER_35]: Life is actually alright otherwise.

02:40:41.557 --> 02:40:42.217
[SPEAKER_10]: Sharksgirl.

02:40:43.438 --> 02:40:44.979
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't really have anything.

02:40:45.059 --> 02:40:46.120
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm feeling pretty mellow.

02:40:47.841 --> 02:40:49.001
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to not being happy.

02:40:49.161 --> 02:40:50.082
[SPEAKER_09]: Or not being angsty.

02:40:50.242 --> 02:40:51.563
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to being happy and not being angsty.

02:40:52.724 --> 02:40:56.086
[SPEAKER_15]: F you to you for giving me an F you.

02:40:56.646 --> 02:40:57.506
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I was looking for.

02:40:59.127 --> 02:41:00.008
[SPEAKER_09]: Nelly, any F yous?

02:41:01.226 --> 02:41:03.747
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for ruining an entire continuity that I grew up with.

02:41:03.967 --> 02:41:04.827
[SPEAKER_20]: I want my $8 back.

02:41:04.867 --> 02:41:05.287
[SPEAKER_20]: Exactly.

02:41:31.634 --> 02:41:33.735
[SPEAKER_19]: Star Wars was my first movie ever.

02:41:34.476 --> 02:41:37.837
[SPEAKER_19]: I was one and my mom drug me screaming to the movie theater.

02:41:38.197 --> 02:41:40.639
[SPEAKER_19]: However, I would be quiet whenever Darth Vader was on the screen.

02:41:40.779 --> 02:41:44.901
[SPEAKER_19]: That would show that I was meant to have a life of evil.

02:41:48.443 --> 02:41:49.903
[SPEAKER_19]: Just screw him.

02:41:50.904 --> 02:41:53.265
[SPEAKER_19]: He's messed with my childhood.

02:41:54.365 --> 02:41:56.286
[SPEAKER_09]: But he did cast Natalie Portman in his movies.

02:41:58.327 --> 02:41:59.328
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gay and I'd hit that.

02:42:01.226 --> 02:42:04.067
[SPEAKER_19]: And she's one of five people in that movie who have any talent.

02:42:06.227 --> 02:42:06.748
[SPEAKER_07]: Very true.

02:42:08.208 --> 02:42:08.488
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

02:42:09.068 --> 02:42:09.808
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, now, man.

02:42:09.848 --> 02:42:10.689
[SPEAKER_07]: Chewbacca.

02:42:11.669 --> 02:42:12.009
[SPEAKER_07]: That's Oscar.

02:42:12.049 --> 02:42:13.909
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm looking forward to seeing the Wookiee planet, though.

02:42:15.470 --> 02:42:15.970
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, God.

02:42:16.190 --> 02:42:17.670
[SPEAKER_08]: They get out of the ship.

02:42:18.271 --> 02:42:19.471
[SPEAKER_08]: What the hell's going on?

02:42:19.491 --> 02:42:19.531
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh!

02:42:21.004 --> 02:42:25.046
[SPEAKER_08]: Dark Knight says, F you to cold weather and ice.

02:42:52.045 --> 02:42:57.550
[SPEAKER_09]: Peralta says, F you to the people who hate my little Euro car with the bright halogen lights.

02:42:57.810 --> 02:42:58.931
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, he didn't say halogen lights.

02:42:58.971 --> 02:43:00.973
[SPEAKER_09]: I threw that in there, but I'm assuming that's what he's referencing.

02:43:03.315 --> 02:43:06.298
[SPEAKER_09]: He also says, F you to the mess I woke up to this morning.

02:43:06.959 --> 02:43:09.661
[SPEAKER_09]: The gays left the house so much cleaner than it was before.

02:43:09.801 --> 02:43:10.882
[SPEAKER_09]: Clara from Drawn Together.

02:43:14.165 --> 02:43:14.746
[SPEAKER_09]: Raichan says,

02:43:15.313 --> 02:43:18.776
[SPEAKER_09]: says, F you to being emotionally stupid the other night.

02:43:19.196 --> 02:43:21.238
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to my mom being a total bitch yesterday.

02:43:21.318 --> 02:43:27.083
[SPEAKER_09]: And Joyce says, F you to horny guys that think they can have ass sex with me while I'm trying to dance.

02:43:28.644 --> 02:43:32.368
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to potholes for trying to mess up my lowered truck.

02:43:34.089 --> 02:43:40.915
[SPEAKER_09]: Big Red Pimp, Ohio Bomani, says, F you to being too broke to buy a para para para controller so I can make drivers for Stepmania.

02:43:42.566 --> 02:43:46.007
[SPEAKER_09]: Zerus says, a big F you to not playing My Baby Daddy sooner.

02:43:46.407 --> 02:43:49.067
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, keep on talking, we ain't gonna play that song, you don't have that attitude.

02:43:49.528 --> 02:43:54.729
[SPEAKER_09]: Jaded2005 says, F you to the person who's requesting My Baby Mama, cause it sucks.

02:43:55.149 --> 02:43:56.949
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that was comic timing.

02:43:58.249 --> 02:44:02.330
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Ranma S says, F you to the fucktards on my job for stealing.

02:44:02.770 --> 02:44:04.891
[SPEAKER_09]: You're making it worse on the entire store.

02:44:06.618 --> 02:44:11.021
[SPEAKER_09]: Seperoff, 1215, says F you to Thursday for no inside the box.

02:44:11.242 --> 02:44:12.282
[SPEAKER_09]: It's actually outside the box.

02:44:12.703 --> 02:44:15.825
[SPEAKER_09]: And F you to the Blizzard for ruining my weekend and DDR playing.

02:44:16.746 --> 02:44:17.907
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, real life got in the way.

02:44:17.927 --> 02:44:18.407
[SPEAKER_09]: What can I say?

02:44:18.947 --> 02:44:22.730
[SPEAKER_09]: Illusion says F you to this weekend being so goddamn boring.

02:44:23.131 --> 02:44:34.339
[SPEAKER_09]: Although Friday was hella, yes, I said hella, fun because Denny's plus karaoke to Love Shack with my friend Amanda and getting a standing ovation from a crowd of drunken Mexicans that couldn't understand what I was even saying.

02:44:34.839 --> 02:44:35.340
[SPEAKER_09]: Dot, dot, dot.

02:44:36.491 --> 02:44:39.933
[SPEAKER_09]: and FU to close your eyes by day behavior being impossible to find.

02:44:42.414 --> 02:44:51.318
[SPEAKER_09]: Phoenix says FU to death, FU for me missing the first part of Orange Lounge Radio and no FU to Jamie because she is the bestest and pretty damn hot too.

02:44:53.139 --> 02:44:54.419
[SPEAKER_09]: You go girl, you got a fan.

02:44:55.239 --> 02:44:55.720
[SPEAKER_00]: My heart.

02:44:57.781 --> 02:44:58.901
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a stalker.

02:45:00.082 --> 02:45:01.542
[SPEAKER_09]: I want a stalker, no fair.

02:45:10.486 --> 02:45:19.832
[SPEAKER_09]: On behalf of Orange Lounge Radio, don't!

02:45:19.852 --> 02:45:22.213
[SPEAKER_20]: There's plenty of McDonald's jobs out there, don't worry.

02:45:22.894 --> 02:45:24.295
[SPEAKER_07]: That's refreshing news, I'm sure.

02:45:24.375 --> 02:45:24.675
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

02:45:26.095 --> 02:45:32.917
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, you need to get a job at Rayleigh's Chinese Food Place because the goddamn people that work there can't fucking speak English.

02:45:34.297 --> 02:45:38.038
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be a relief to... Oh my god, I gotta go into this later.

02:45:38.238 --> 02:45:39.079
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, later on.

02:45:39.479 --> 02:45:41.119
[SPEAKER_09]: After this, you're done reading these.

02:45:43.160 --> 02:45:50.042
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100Matt says, Big FU for Dell Indian Tech Support trying to get me to reformat my PC when I didn't need to.

02:45:50.562 --> 02:45:53.263

02:45:55.495 --> 02:46:00.757
[SPEAKER_09]: Mikolatov says, F you to Konami for making me come up with passcodes for a free sweet code in Forswag.

02:46:01.257 --> 02:46:04.739
[SPEAKER_09]: I fucking hate slide puzzles, so of course I had to do one to get a code.

02:46:04.779 --> 02:46:08.920
[SPEAKER_09]: And F you to Final Fantasy XI for making Black Mage artifact armor so hard to get.

02:46:09.020 --> 02:46:10.001
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn you, Squeenix.

02:46:11.481 --> 02:46:14.843
[SPEAKER_09]: DDR Angel says, F you to the garrison run on Final Fantasy XI.

02:46:15.163 --> 02:46:16.263
[SPEAKER_09]: It was hard to stay alive.

02:46:16.403 --> 02:46:19.725
[SPEAKER_09]: I made it, and it was fun to have a new experience and game with an 18-person alliance.

02:46:19.785 --> 02:46:21.786
[SPEAKER_09]: But F you to it being difficult and disorienting.

02:46:21.866 --> 02:46:22.126
[SPEAKER_09]: Done.

02:46:22.246 --> 02:46:22.546
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

02:46:24.967 --> 02:46:25.087
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

02:46:26.599 --> 02:46:29.620
[SPEAKER_09]: Islander says, F you to everyone hating on my baby daddy.

02:46:30.600 --> 02:46:31.120
[SPEAKER_24]: Word.

02:46:31.300 --> 02:46:33.000
[SPEAKER_09]: Zerus says, another F you.

02:46:33.080 --> 02:46:36.341
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is pronounced Zerious.

02:46:37.041 --> 02:46:37.601
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my bad.

02:46:38.462 --> 02:46:39.722
[SPEAKER_09]: Like serious, but Zerious.

02:46:40.922 --> 02:46:41.562
[SPEAKER_09]: My bad.

02:46:41.862 --> 02:46:42.382
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm white.

02:46:42.482 --> 02:46:42.803
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

02:46:43.363 --> 02:46:44.823
[SPEAKER_09]: Dork says, F you to work.

02:46:44.883 --> 02:46:46.543
[SPEAKER_09]: Because of it, I almost got shot.

02:46:48.464 --> 02:46:49.484
[SPEAKER_09]: And Zaku says...

02:46:51.091 --> 02:46:55.233
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to the sky taking a shit on the east coast in the form of snow this weekend.

02:46:55.293 --> 02:46:56.254
[SPEAKER_09]: At least it's not yellow snow.

02:46:56.794 --> 02:46:59.575
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to the current school semester with a shitty GPA.

02:47:00.096 --> 02:47:02.877
[SPEAKER_09]: And F you to being laid off from my current job on Friday.

02:47:03.157 --> 02:47:03.497
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up?

02:47:08.660 --> 02:47:10.941
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't pronounce this guy's name right no matter what.

02:47:12.602 --> 02:47:13.082
[SPEAKER_09]: Zyrus.

02:47:16.966 --> 02:47:17.748
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm getting yelled at.

02:47:20.113 --> 02:47:22.719
[SPEAKER_09]: Flynn says, F you to PCs, Max Rock.

02:47:24.703 --> 02:47:25.905
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you got a cheer there from...

02:47:27.282 --> 02:47:32.464
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, I do have to say that I'm considering getting a Mac after they get cheaper for one reason.

02:47:32.804 --> 02:47:33.285
[SPEAKER_19]: Mac Mini.

02:47:33.325 --> 02:47:37.326
[SPEAKER_19]: I want the Mac Mini to build a countertop main machine out of.

02:47:37.346 --> 02:47:40.188
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a lot of people that are considering using Mac Minis for other things.

02:47:40.488 --> 02:47:40.848
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

02:47:41.048 --> 02:47:44.049
[SPEAKER_19]: I wouldn't use it to actually, you know, use it for a computer.

02:47:45.030 --> 02:47:47.131
[SPEAKER_09]: I want the laptops to come down to those kinds of prices.

02:47:47.511 --> 02:47:51.113
[SPEAKER_19]: Except since a lot of my major is now graphic arts and taught in the Mac Lab.

02:47:53.734 --> 02:47:54.034
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

02:47:55.735 --> 02:47:56.615
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's

02:47:57.456 --> 02:48:02.162
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you guys for participating in tonight's FUs of the Week.

02:48:11.381 --> 02:48:14.983
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to my cable modem and CD DVD drives for being out.

02:48:15.243 --> 02:48:17.404
[SPEAKER_09]: Can still get on AIM via my cell at least.

02:48:17.844 --> 02:48:19.224
[SPEAKER_09]: But she's unable to listen to the show.

02:48:19.385 --> 02:48:20.745
[SPEAKER_19]: I actually had another one to add.

02:48:20.765 --> 02:48:21.906
[SPEAKER_19]: This is just laughable.

02:48:22.326 --> 02:48:28.248
[SPEAKER_19]: How many people, my orientation for my Photoshop class was, it's an online class, was taught in the Mac Lab.

02:48:28.829 --> 02:48:32.890
[SPEAKER_19]: And it was amazing that half the people were saying, how do I get on to the blackboard?

02:48:33.150 --> 02:48:35.271
[SPEAKER_19]: Because they didn't know where to find Internet Explorer.

02:48:37.032 --> 02:48:38.333
[SPEAKER_19]: I just laughed.

02:48:42.033 --> 02:48:44.735
[SPEAKER_19]: I laughed for a very long time.

02:48:44.795 --> 02:48:50.441
[SPEAKER_19]: My first computer was one of those old Apple 2E tall ones.

02:48:51.161 --> 02:48:54.104
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like, this thing's taller than my head.

02:48:55.245 --> 02:48:59.209
[SPEAKER_17]: Along the playing, where in the world is Carmen Sandiego on those things?

02:49:00.611 --> 02:49:07.175
[SPEAKER_07]: As I was going to say before about the retarded people at the Chinese food place, there was actually someone that was more retarded than the sample lady.

02:49:07.675 --> 02:49:20.121
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was this person, I don't even know who she was, she wasn't even Asian, but I was like, I want the large rice plate, as advertised in this little thing here where it's $4.99.

02:49:20.601 --> 02:49:22.241
[SPEAKER_07]: So what she does, she starts going for the chow mein.

02:49:22.262 --> 02:49:25.263
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, large rice plate, not chow mein!

02:49:26.184 --> 02:49:27.685
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and so she's like, oh!

02:49:28.186 --> 02:49:37.514
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so she gets the rice, and then she doesn't know what she's doing, she keeps asking the Asian people, and they're just like, looking at her funny, like, you don't understand?

02:49:38.314 --> 02:49:39.174
[SPEAKER_07]: You stupid!

02:49:39.835 --> 02:49:42.796
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyways, I finally got my stuff, but man, she was a retard.

02:49:44.156 --> 02:50:06.905
[SPEAKER_07]: And the other thing I was going to mention, which is kind of cool, in two weeks I get to go see the Kings play, even though I'm not a Kings fan, but I won floor tickets to the Kings, and I honestly, I hate the Kings, but we're watching them play the Knicks, and I'm taking my mom because she likes the Kings, and whatever, so...

02:50:07.546 --> 02:50:08.748
[SPEAKER_07]: I get to go sit on the floor.

02:50:10.830 --> 02:50:14.635
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I hope something cool happens like a meteor hits them and kills them all.

02:50:15.156 --> 02:50:16.097
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that'd be cool.

02:50:16.778 --> 02:50:18.540
[SPEAKER_07]: Or if one of them has a heart attack or something.

02:50:18.560 --> 02:50:20.482
[SPEAKER_07]: I should bring marbles.

02:50:22.345 --> 02:50:26.530
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if I want to die...

02:50:28.789 --> 02:50:33.170
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we're going to go to a quick break, and when we come back, a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge.

02:50:33.230 --> 02:50:37.111
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a little bit of time for Ask Orange Lounge, or you could ask Mel B, Shark's Girl, or Explicit.

02:50:37.951 --> 02:50:39.071
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you could ask Nellie.

02:50:39.111 --> 02:50:40.051
[SPEAKER_09]: That doesn't mean she'll answer you.

02:50:40.492 --> 02:50:44.653
[SPEAKER_09]: You can ask... I'm going to ask Nellie.

02:50:45.093 --> 02:50:45.693
[SPEAKER_07]: No, never mind.

02:50:46.673 --> 02:50:47.273
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, anyway.

02:50:47.653 --> 02:50:49.894
[SPEAKER_20]: How much money would it take for you to rape Robin?

02:50:50.714 --> 02:50:51.234
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

02:50:51.956 --> 02:50:55.500
[SPEAKER_09]: Ask Orange Lounge when we come back for a little bit, and then we're going to put the nail in the coffin of this show.

02:50:55.821 --> 02:51:01.948
[SPEAKER_09]: In this break, we're going to do a two-song break featuring some requests, some songs that you guys have been requesting all night long.

02:51:01.988 --> 02:51:02.428
[SPEAKER_09]: Here you go.

02:51:02.688 --> 02:51:04.571
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to start it off with a little bit of a ballad.

02:51:05.552 --> 02:51:08.415
[SPEAKER_09]: So get out the lighters and slow dance to this one.

02:51:22.934 --> 02:51:23.635
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

02:51:23.655 --> 02:51:24.095
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

02:51:47.967 --> 02:51:48.668
Thanks for watching!

02:52:28.924 --> 02:52:29.587
Thanks for watching!

02:53:03.001 --> 02:53:04.122
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

02:54:21.445 --> 02:54:27.251
[SPEAKER_34]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

02:54:32.015 --> 02:54:34.898
[SPEAKER_09]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:54:38.061 --> 02:54:42.606
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was going to do Ask Orange Lounge, but nobody submitted a question yet.

02:54:42.966 --> 02:54:44.167
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a question.

02:54:44.227 --> 02:54:45.588
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on, we've got to do the music.

02:54:45.628 --> 02:54:46.089
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a minute here.

02:54:52.506 --> 02:54:56.188
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I just put it there in chat, a reminder of how to ask Orange Lounge if you would like.

02:54:56.208 --> 02:54:58.509
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, ask us a question, bitches.

02:54:58.569 --> 02:55:05.072
[SPEAKER_09]: But since we don't have any questions yet, what we'll do is we'll allow somebody in the room to ask other folks in the room a question.

02:55:05.152 --> 02:55:07.353
[SPEAKER_09]: So let me get the theme music so we can play.

02:55:10.094 --> 02:55:10.514
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go.

02:55:14.076 --> 02:55:14.516
Here we go.

02:55:17.731 --> 02:55:20.673
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

02:55:21.173 --> 02:55:24.395
[SPEAKER_09]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

02:55:24.815 --> 02:55:26.316
[SPEAKER_09]: Will you rape me in a bus?

02:55:26.676 --> 02:55:28.197
[SPEAKER_09]: Will you rape me in a car?

02:55:28.557 --> 02:55:30.058
[SPEAKER_09]: Will you... Fuck it.

02:55:40.003 --> 02:55:41.624
[SPEAKER_09]: Peralta has a question.

02:55:41.984 --> 02:55:44.806
[SPEAKER_09]: When will you report on Tony Hawk's latest game?

02:55:46.730 --> 02:55:48.571
[SPEAKER_19]: When monkeys fly out of my ass.

02:55:48.591 --> 02:55:52.454
[SPEAKER_09]: When one magically appears on the hard drive of my HD loader.

02:55:52.774 --> 02:55:59.018
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to play The Punisher because you can kill people in hundreds of different ways.

02:56:11.761 --> 02:56:21.223
[SPEAKER_07]: including like taking their jaw, opening it up on a curb and smashing their skull down or throwing them through wood chippers or drill presses or like many other ways.

02:56:21.283 --> 02:56:28.045
[SPEAKER_07]: You can interrogate them over a roof by dangling them by their feet and then you can let them go and like a bunch of other fun stuff like that.

02:56:28.465 --> 02:56:29.865
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like super violent and stuff.

02:56:31.446 --> 02:56:32.826
[SPEAKER_19]: Someone's played my favorite game already.

02:56:33.226 --> 02:56:34.906
[SPEAKER_09]: Peralta has a follow-up question.

02:56:35.707 --> 02:56:37.727
[SPEAKER_09]: When will monkeys be flying out of Jamie's ass?

02:56:39.328 --> 02:56:40.088
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully never.

02:56:42.475 --> 02:56:50.640
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, uh, Zerus says, why do so many people hate on my baby, insert parent figure here, my baby mama or my baby daddy?

02:56:51.780 --> 02:56:57.123
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't hate it, I just think we do play that song an awful lot, we're supposed to, you know, that's supposed to be a rainy day song.

02:56:57.403 --> 02:57:04.527
[SPEAKER_19]: We need to do the more politically correct version, you know, uh, my baby non-gender specific parental unit.

02:57:06.409 --> 02:57:07.349
[SPEAKER_09]: My baby parent.

02:57:08.190 --> 02:57:08.990
[SPEAKER_07]: My baby guardian.

02:57:10.638 --> 02:57:14.420
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been reading a lot of those politically correct bedtime stories, those little books.

02:57:16.181 --> 02:57:21.883
[SPEAKER_19]: And so, I was actually spending the other day trying to filk songs to do them politically correct.

02:57:22.783 --> 02:57:23.184
[SPEAKER_16]: It didn't work.

02:57:23.204 --> 02:57:25.004
[SPEAKER_16]: Why does my baby have two mamas?

02:57:25.785 --> 02:57:28.466
[SPEAKER_16]: My baby mamas?

02:57:29.403 --> 02:57:30.243
[SPEAKER_09]: My baby mamas.

02:57:31.183 --> 02:57:31.563
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

02:57:32.264 --> 02:57:35.704
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to kind of tear through these because suddenly we're getting like eight questions.

02:57:35.764 --> 02:57:36.204
[SPEAKER_09]: It's crazy.

02:57:36.224 --> 02:57:38.485
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've got to burn through these because we've only got a little show left here.

02:57:38.965 --> 02:57:42.045
[SPEAKER_09]: K- wants to know, what is the best way to pick up chicks?

02:57:43.546 --> 02:57:44.446
[SPEAKER_09]: Show them your wallet.

02:57:45.666 --> 02:57:47.046
[SPEAKER_16]: Lift them by the shoulders.

02:57:47.346 --> 02:57:47.926
[SPEAKER_09]: A backhoe.

02:57:49.887 --> 02:57:51.467
[SPEAKER_35]: Tell them you're a great freestyler.

02:57:51.647 --> 02:57:55.208
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, when he says chicks, he means chicks at DDR Tourneys.

02:57:55.648 --> 02:57:56.948
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, show them your wallet.

02:57:57.890 --> 02:58:00.772
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, unless they're competing, they're usually there to watch their boyfriends.

02:58:01.652 --> 02:58:03.353
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a barnyard at tournaments?

02:58:03.413 --> 02:58:04.133
[SPEAKER_16]: Little chicks?

02:58:04.494 --> 02:58:06.615
[SPEAKER_16]: Cheep, cheep, cheep, ha, ha, ha.

02:58:06.695 --> 02:58:07.275
[SPEAKER_09]: Boo!

02:58:08.095 --> 02:58:10.837
[SPEAKER_09]: Just kidding.

02:58:11.617 --> 02:58:12.918
[SPEAKER_09]: Do I have any serious advice?

02:58:13.198 --> 02:58:13.678
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

02:58:15.960 --> 02:58:17.040
[SPEAKER_09]: Just go up and say hi.

02:58:17.260 --> 02:58:18.881
[SPEAKER_09]: Girls are impressed with a guy with balls.

02:58:19.121 --> 02:58:19.962
[SPEAKER_09]: Just go up and say hi.

02:58:20.842 --> 02:58:22.283
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't say hi repeatedly.

02:58:22.343 --> 02:58:24.444
[SPEAKER_00]: If she walks away, don't follow her.

02:58:24.464 --> 02:58:25.404
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's stalking.

02:58:27.981 --> 02:58:28.401
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura?

02:58:29.201 --> 02:58:36.644
[SPEAKER_19]: Well... If she just doesn't say anything to you, but doesn't move, maybe she didn't hear you.

02:58:37.484 --> 02:58:38.005
[SPEAKER_09]: That could be.

02:58:38.285 --> 02:58:39.645
[SPEAKER_19]: Or she's pointedly ignoring you.

02:58:39.765 --> 02:58:40.445
[SPEAKER_09]: Or she's deaf.

02:58:40.625 --> 02:58:41.006
[SPEAKER_09]: Or dead.

02:58:41.606 --> 02:58:43.186
[SPEAKER_07]: Or dead.

02:58:43.246 --> 02:58:47.568
[SPEAKER_07]: A DDR tournament is not a good place to talk to women because it's so fucking loud there.

02:58:47.788 --> 02:58:49.369
[SPEAKER_19]: Wait until they go outside.

02:58:50.049 --> 02:58:53.130
[SPEAKER_19]: Casually stand there and go, Oh, hi, I saw you inside.

02:58:53.430 --> 02:58:54.070
[SPEAKER_20]: Whip it out!

02:58:56.914 --> 02:58:57.474
[SPEAKER_19]: Go planet!

02:58:57.554 --> 02:58:58.255
[SPEAKER_19]: Illusion says...

02:59:26.513 --> 02:59:26.953
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell?

02:59:28.655 --> 02:59:33.059
[SPEAKER_09]: Read any good books lately that aren't of the homoerotic variety, a.k.a.

02:59:33.159 --> 02:59:33.880
[SPEAKER_09]: Anne Rice novels?

02:59:34.741 --> 02:59:35.461
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, it's funny.

02:59:35.641 --> 02:59:40.866
[SPEAKER_19]: My bathroom reading right now is an Anne Rice novel.

02:59:40.946 --> 02:59:42.968
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm reading the sequel to Blackwood Farm.

02:59:51.692 --> 02:59:54.975
[SPEAKER_19]: But it's all from Lestat's point of view, which I think he's absolutely hilarious.

02:59:55.635 --> 03:00:02.861
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to know why people are busting up laughing, it's because somebody in chat said, DER attorneys are not a good place to talk to girls because they are probably underage.

03:00:04.142 --> 03:00:07.184
[SPEAKER_09]: Anybody else reading any books they want to share?

03:00:07.504 --> 03:00:09.005
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm reading a book on how to start your own business.

03:00:09.966 --> 03:00:11.627
[SPEAKER_16]: Will Wheaton, just a geek.

03:00:11.727 --> 03:00:14.710
[SPEAKER_16]: He's an awesome author and he's even funnier live.

03:00:14.870 --> 03:00:15.310
[SPEAKER_35]: That's hot.

03:00:16.384 --> 03:00:26.008
[SPEAKER_35]: Dark Knight says, about Mario DDR, if they had no choice but to put a Max 300 style song in it using a Nintendo game song, what would it be?

03:00:26.028 --> 03:00:27.109
[SPEAKER_35]: The Legend of Zelda!

03:00:27.169 --> 03:00:27.229
[SPEAKER_09]: Duh!

03:00:27.249 --> 03:00:27.369
[SPEAKER_09]: Duh!

03:00:47.199 --> 03:00:56.567
[SPEAKER_09]: If real radio makes Captain Jack cry, do pay-based podcasts make Politary make another bad song?

03:00:59.289 --> 03:01:00.690
[SPEAKER_09]: Pay-based podcasts?

03:01:00.810 --> 03:01:01.931
[SPEAKER_09]: That makes me sick.

03:01:02.551 --> 03:01:07.295
[SPEAKER_16]: If a tree falls in the middle of the forest and nobody's around, nobody's still listening to internet radio.

03:01:14.266 --> 03:01:16.068
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember that in Family Guy.

03:01:16.148 --> 03:01:19.752
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, yeah, Phil fell down last week and he hasn't stopped talking about it.

03:01:21.734 --> 03:01:23.696
[SPEAKER_09]: Mikulatov has a question for Loki.

03:01:24.116 --> 03:01:28.921
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, why did you not include Strangers with Candy, the movie, as one of the must-see movies of the year?

03:01:30.475 --> 03:01:57.295
[SPEAKER_09]: because I had to pick one and you know Sin City was over Strangers with Candy I still want to see Constantine over Sin City I will make Strangers with Candy my must-see movie of the year there you have it I still want to see Constantine Legend of Zaku says out of all the acts from last Tuesday's and Wednesday's American Idol which do you think was the worst act and why?

03:01:57.796 --> 03:01:59.237
[SPEAKER_09]: did anybody actually watch it?

03:02:00.352 --> 03:02:01.672
[SPEAKER_19]: Who in here doesn't watch TV?

03:02:02.533 --> 03:02:03.873
[SPEAKER_09]: My hand is raised.

03:02:04.473 --> 03:02:05.513
[SPEAKER_19]: I watched it.

03:02:06.054 --> 03:02:07.594
[SPEAKER_07]: I was here watching it, remember?

03:02:08.714 --> 03:02:10.235
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the last chick was cool.

03:02:10.815 --> 03:02:12.175
[SPEAKER_07]: Because she was insane.

03:02:13.535 --> 03:02:15.596
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say the guy that was related to Toni Braxton.

03:02:16.156 --> 03:02:16.696
[SPEAKER_09]: Supposedly.

03:02:20.457 --> 03:02:22.558
[SPEAKER_09]: Who was the worst singer on American Idol Tuesday or Wednesday?

03:02:23.178 --> 03:02:27.659
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, it was the crazy girl who had multiple personalities and she had different voices talking to her.

03:02:27.699 --> 03:02:28.379
[SPEAKER_20]: That was hilarious.

03:02:29.847 --> 03:02:33.408
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100 Matt says, Why do only gay guys and not hot girls get turned on by guys playing DDR?

03:02:56.943 --> 03:02:57.963
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's my answer to that.

03:02:58.023 --> 03:03:03.665
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Murphy's Law in action, because I, being a gay man, I only attract women playing DDR.

03:03:04.605 --> 03:03:06.386
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's just the way life works, buddy.

03:03:06.926 --> 03:03:07.266
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

03:03:07.926 --> 03:03:10.327
[SPEAKER_09]: Your non-preferred gender is the one that'll start hitting on you.

03:03:10.387 --> 03:03:11.567
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just, life's funny.

03:03:13.247 --> 03:03:15.848
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it says, Shark's Girl says on the contrary.

03:03:15.868 --> 03:03:17.088
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if you're a girl, it's different.

03:03:17.709 --> 03:03:22.490
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, if you're a girl and you're playing any video game and you're any good at it, yeah, you get some attention most of the time.

03:03:22.970 --> 03:03:26.091
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh my God, when I worked for Cyber Station...

03:03:27.714 --> 03:03:31.935
[SPEAKER_19]: Walking around with the Pac-Man shirt, playing Tekken 3 back in the day.

03:03:32.395 --> 03:03:34.655
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got boobs and you're good at games!

03:03:34.976 --> 03:03:35.956
[SPEAKER_16]: Marry me now!

03:03:35.976 --> 03:03:37.736
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and I just kicked your ass.

03:03:38.276 --> 03:03:46.498
[SPEAKER_16]: When I worked at the shark store, wearing a hockey jersey, spouting facts and knowing more than the guys around, um, oh dear god, it was crazy.

03:03:47.358 --> 03:03:52.899
[SPEAKER_19]: What would get to people is when I would accurately predict the next character to come out, because I would follow the Japanese machines.

03:03:53.879 --> 03:03:56.260
[SPEAKER_19]: And actually, they did three characters out of order.

03:03:57.205 --> 03:04:03.590
[SPEAKER_16]: I was playing Star Wars once and I had 10 year old boys that looked like they were about ready to propose marriage to me because I was so good at it.

03:04:04.391 --> 03:04:08.334
[SPEAKER_16]: I would put the cursor where characters were before they were there because I had memorized all the patterns.

03:04:09.214 --> 03:04:11.436
[SPEAKER_20]: Boys don't like it when girls are smarter than they are.

03:04:11.536 --> 03:04:13.157
[SPEAKER_20]: I try to pretend like I'm stupid.

03:04:19.640 --> 03:04:23.262
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's a line that you hit depending on what type of group.

03:04:25.624 --> 03:04:30.567
[SPEAKER_19]: You get the worship in some groups and then you get the other way around in other groups.

03:04:30.587 --> 03:04:31.948
[SPEAKER_19]: It was really bad in Alabama.

03:04:32.788 --> 03:04:39.032
[SPEAKER_19]: I was just glad that my boyfriend at the time was as big of a nerd as I was and liked to drink just as much as I did.

03:04:43.752 --> 03:04:54.438
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we gotta wrap it up, so one more question, and then we're gonna put the nail in the coffin on Ask Orange Lounge, and I apologize to those of you that were cutting off, we just did the questions in the order we received them, so you were towards the end, sorry guys.

03:04:54.999 --> 03:05:04.144
[SPEAKER_09]: DDR Angel wants to know, if Myst is like 20 years old and still very popular, what do you think DDR or Bramante in general will be at its 20 year old birthday?

03:05:05.265 --> 03:05:05.665
[SPEAKER_35]: 20 years old.

03:05:06.696 --> 03:05:16.845
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it'll be the thing that's going to be on VH1's I Love the Zeros and Hal Sparks is sitting there going, those crazy kids were playing that game with the flashing seizure lights.

03:05:16.985 --> 03:05:19.788
[SPEAKER_16]: And somewhere someone's still going to be raping the bar.

03:05:21.770 --> 03:05:22.150
[SPEAKER_09]: Word.

03:05:22.470 --> 03:05:22.771
[SPEAKER_09]: Word.

03:05:23.760 --> 03:05:26.601
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, I think that definitely sums it up.

03:05:27.201 --> 03:05:27.801
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura?

03:05:27.821 --> 03:05:31.282
[SPEAKER_19]: I just had this vision of this person 20 years from now.

03:05:32.222 --> 03:05:37.503
[SPEAKER_19]: Waiting until everybody's gone, the lights are out, reaching into their closet and pulling out one of those bars.

03:05:38.223 --> 03:05:45.285
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Orange Lounge Radio Live, this is episode 1048, and you're... And I need a job!

03:05:46.865 --> 03:05:47.225
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

03:05:47.625 --> 03:05:48.986
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, our contract just ended for G5.

03:05:51.661 --> 03:05:54.032
[SPEAKER_19]: And you know, we've decided that we're going to go off on our own.

03:05:54.173 --> 03:05:54.936
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to expand.

03:05:55.976 --> 03:06:01.437
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, we just got done buying out 50 companies, and this one we're all uber successful and elitist.

03:06:01.477 --> 03:06:03.818
[SPEAKER_19]: We have people to pretend to be us.

03:06:04.498 --> 03:06:12.660
[SPEAKER_09]: And in the latest ratings book, we just got the latest ratings book, and look, Orange Lounge Radio has beaten G4 Television in the ratings book.

03:06:13.180 --> 03:06:18.402
[SPEAKER_09]: And, oh, it looks like the two guys tickling each other channel on Live 365 also beat G4.

03:06:22.443 --> 03:06:24.063
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, it looks like

03:06:24.699 --> 03:06:31.020
[SPEAKER_10]: G4 came in next to last place and in last place the microphone up a donkey's butt station.

03:06:31.040 --> 03:06:34.221
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I like that station.

03:06:35.101 --> 03:06:38.582
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't be dissing the microphone up ass ass station.

03:06:40.542 --> 03:06:40.882
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

03:06:41.602 --> 03:06:43.403
[SPEAKER_09]: We gotta go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

03:06:43.423 --> 03:06:44.823
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry to those questions we didn't get to.

03:06:45.163 --> 03:06:50.624
[SPEAKER_09]: Explicit, your final thought.

03:06:53.625 --> 03:06:54.525
[SPEAKER_09]: Mel B, your final thought.

03:06:55.208 --> 03:06:56.729
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh man, it's good to be back up in here.

03:06:56.749 --> 03:06:58.610
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so boring, I don't have one.

03:06:58.650 --> 03:06:59.970
[SPEAKER_16]: How much money would it take?

03:06:59.990 --> 03:07:02.852
[SPEAKER_16]: I kid you not, I have seen pictures of a baby soup.

03:07:20.129 --> 03:07:27.175
[SPEAKER_07]: Go to superzooi.com, that's S-U-P-E-R-Z-O-O-I dot com.

03:07:27.455 --> 03:07:33.800
[SPEAKER_07]: In the left-hand column, there will be a picture thing, and click on the one that says Baby Soup, and it actually shows it.

03:07:35.181 --> 03:07:37.382
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is, why is he a co-host?

03:07:38.824 --> 03:07:39.124
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

03:07:39.684 --> 03:07:40.265
[SPEAKER_09]: Why, why, why?

03:07:40.385 --> 03:07:40.645
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie?

03:07:40.925 --> 03:07:44.088
[SPEAKER_19]: My final thought was because he sat on the floor long enough to yearn to spot...

03:07:46.786 --> 03:07:48.527
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, final word of the show.

03:07:48.648 --> 03:07:50.609

[SPEAKER_09]: Why not, Mel?

03:08:05.441 --> 03:08:06.062
[SPEAKER_09]: You got the mic.

03:08:06.262 --> 03:08:07.303
[SPEAKER_09]: One word to sum it all up.

03:08:13.612 --> 03:08:25.480

03:09:07.206 --> 03:09:14.249
[SPEAKER_22]: In sleep he sang to me, in dreams he came, that voice which calls to me and speaks my name.

03:09:53.663 --> 03:10:20.734
[SPEAKER_27]: My power over you grows stronger yet And though you turn from me to glance behind The phantom of the authorized

03:10:35.032 --> 03:10:45.142
[SPEAKER_22]: Those who have seen your face draw back in fear I am the moth

03:10:47.246 --> 03:10:59.776
[SPEAKER_27]: It's me they hear, your spirit and your voice in one combined.

03:11:00.097 --> 03:11:09.084
The power to hold the operatic dead inside my mind.

03:11:30.399 --> 03:11:36.882
[SPEAKER_27]: Say you're my angel of youth Say you're my dream Say you're for me

03:12:00.372 --> 03:12:01.714
and my angels!

03:12:16.827 --> 03:12:44.495
[SPEAKER_36]: I have brought you to this seat of sweet music's tone To this kingdom where all must pay homage to music Music, you have come here For one purpose and one alone

03:12:45.891 --> 03:12:57.979
[SPEAKER_36]: Since the moment I first heard you sing, I have needed you with me to serve me to sing for my music.

03:13:01.041 --> 03:13:03.602
[SPEAKER_36]: My music.

03:13:09.066 --> 03:13:12.548
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:13:34.978 --> 03:13:38.140
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright guys, that's it for tonight's broadcast of Orange Launch Radio.

03:13:38.160 --> 03:13:41.462
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I totally forgot to get into the DDR Freak Idol thing.

03:13:41.883 --> 03:13:45.025
[SPEAKER_09]: You know they're doing a DDR Freak Idol competition in random chat right now?

03:13:45.265 --> 03:13:47.066
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, lovely.

03:13:47.086 --> 03:13:49.248
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm going to volunteer us to get involved somehow.

03:13:49.308 --> 03:13:50.148
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it might be fun.

03:13:50.909 --> 03:13:51.329
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

03:13:52.370 --> 03:13:54.751
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the DDR Freak users, you know, they want to sing.

03:13:55.092 --> 03:13:56.132
[SPEAKER_09]: So, why not?
