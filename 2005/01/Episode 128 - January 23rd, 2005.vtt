WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
And as we wind down I-95, yeah, our shadow's taller than our soul.

00:12.000 --> 00:21.000
Hey, there's that lady we all know, she's shining white light and wants to show.

00:21.000 --> 00:31.000
And if you listen very hard That tune will come to you at last

00:31.000 --> 00:40.000
All for one, one for all Baby, you're rockin' the tune

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
I said, roll, roll, roll.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
I said, roll.

00:46.000 --> 01:05.640
And, she's, buying, a stairway!

01:05.640 --> 01:06.140
Agh!

01:15.320 --> 01:15.820
Kevin!

01:18.600 --> 01:22.360
And I'm sailing!

01:29.640 --> 01:31.320
Should've been, could've been, would've been dead

01:31.320 --> 01:33.320
If I didn't get the message going to my head

01:33.320 --> 01:35.000
I am what I am

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Most motherfuckers don't give a damn

01:37.000 --> 01:38.500
Oh baby, think you can

01:38.500 --> 01:40.300
Be my girl, I'll be your man

01:40.300 --> 01:42.200
Someone full of fun, do be tellin' well done

01:42.200 --> 01:44.200
Little woe, keep comin' for my stun gun

01:44.200 --> 01:45.700
Beware, take care

01:45.700 --> 01:47.700
Most motherfuckers have a cold ass snare

01:47.700 --> 01:49.300
Oh baby, please be there

01:49.300 --> 01:51.700
Suck my kiss, cut me my share

01:55.000 --> 01:57.200
Hit me, you can't hurt me

01:57.200 --> 01:58.700
Suck my kiss

01:58.700 --> 02:00.700
Kiss me, please, pervert me

02:00.700 --> 02:02.200
Stick with this

02:02.200 --> 02:05.200
Is she talking dirty?

02:05.200 --> 02:09.200
Give to me sweet sacred bliss, your milk was made to suck my kiss!

02:24.200 --> 02:28.200
I took her out, it was a Friday night

02:28.200 --> 02:31.200
I walk alone to get the feeling right

02:31.200 --> 02:35.200
We started making out, and she took off my pants

02:35.200 --> 02:38.200
But then I turned on the TV

02:38.200 --> 02:42.200
And that's about the time she walked away from me

02:42.200 --> 02:45.200
Nobody likes you when you're 23

02:45.200 --> 02:48.200
And I'm still more amused by TV shows

02:48.200 --> 02:50.200
What the hell is ad?

02:50.200 --> 02:52.200
My friends say I should act my age

02:52.200 --> 02:54.200
What's my age again?

02:54.200 --> 02:56.200
What's my age again?

02:56.200 --> 03:06.600
Then later on, on the drive home, I called her mom from a payphone

03:06.600 --> 03:09.800
I said, I want the cops, and your husband's in jail

03:09.800 --> 03:15.080
The state looks down on sodomy And that's about the time that bitch hung

03:15.080 --> 03:20.720
up on me Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three

03:20.720 --> 03:25.320
And I'm still more amused by bank phone calls What the heck is call ID?

03:25.320 --> 03:29.320
My friends say I shit at my age, what's my age again?

03:29.320 --> 03:33.320
What's my age again?

03:43.320 --> 03:49.320
Look at those stars, see how they shine for boo

03:49.320 --> 03:53.320

Well, she was looking like she was taking a shit while she was drinking the energy because her eyes just went to like...

Right.

09:43.340 --> 09:47.340
Anyway, okay, that's the story. Nobody cares, buh-bye.

09:47.340 --> 09:54.340
Alright, I know we have more special guests. We have some surprise special guests who are going to show up any minute. I'm very excited about that.

And, um, whole much more stuff to talk about tonight. Um, Konami has a big fat announcement and people think they've figured out what it is.

10:03.340 --> 10:08.340
We've got Dance Dance Revolution Mario stuff. It's great.

10:08.340 --> 10:13.340
I know what the Konami announcement is. You know, all the people in power there have a humongous daikon up their butt.

10:13.340 --> 10:18.340
The Konami announcement is... Get a life!

10:18.340 --> 10:23.340

11:34.340 --> 11:41.340
Let me tell you something you don't know

11:41.340 --> 11:49.340
If you keep those secrets I won't know

11:49.340 --> 11:58.340
If you keep those secrets I won't know

11:58.340 --> 12:00.340
Oh, oh, oh, oh

14:44.340 --> 14:48.340
All the mysteries of life

Hello, how are you today?

16:24.780 --> 16:25.780

16:25.780 --> 16:26.780
Did you have a question?

16:26.780 --> 16:28.780
Well, yes, actually I wanted to know.

16:28.780 --> 16:33.780
Can I please have your first name only and your birthdate, please?

16:33.780 --> 16:38.780

16:38.780 --> 16:39.780
Alright, go ahead.

16:39.780 --> 16:43.780
Well, what do you think of Loki, one of the three hosts of Orange Lounge Radio?

16:43.780 --> 16:44.780
Is he incarcerated?

16:44.780 --> 16:48.780
Uh, actually, no he's not, but what do you think of the ever-ranty Dark Sakura?

16:48.780 --> 16:50.780
Hi, dear, how are you?

16:50.780 --> 16:51.780
I love you.

16:51.780 --> 16:54.780
I see you two must know each other. Well, what do you think of Sky?

16:54.780 --> 16:56.780
Did he used to play football when he was in high school?

16:56.780 --> 16:58.780
Well, actually, no he didn't.

16:58.780 --> 16:59.780
Ha ha ha ha!

16:59.780 --> 17:01.780
Well, what do you think of Intern Zero?

17:01.780 --> 17:05.780
I want you to really remember the pill, alright?

17:05.780 --> 17:11.780
I'm seeing some forgetting, possibly, and I'm seeing a new baby in the next three months.

17:11.780 --> 17:15.780
Right. Okay, well, thanks for being on Orange Lounge Radio today.

17:15.780 --> 17:20.780
Um, I don't mean to sidetrack your question here, but who are all of these nosy people,

17:20.780 --> 17:24.780
outside influences I'm seeing around you by the moon card?

17:24.780 --> 17:26.780
Get away from me.

17:27.780 --> 17:32.780
Orange Lounge Radio, helping to free your mind and spirit.

17:32.780 --> 17:38.080
spirit. I'm Miss Cleo, I love you.

17:38.080 --> 17:44.980
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio. Thank you for joining us on this lovely Sunday night.

17:44.980 --> 17:50.540
We're here of course every Sunday night for you guys. 6.30 Pacific Standard Time to 9.30

17:50.540 --> 17:55.820
Pacific Standard Time. All that discussion on rhythm and music video gaming and video

17:55.820 --> 18:02.740
video games that don't suck, and some that do. Join us in our chat room, www.orangelauntrader.com,

18:02.740 --> 18:07.060
click on chat. Whatever happened to Intern Zero by the way?

18:07.060 --> 18:12.900
I know a whole bunch of crap about him, that I'm not at liberty to speak of, but it involves

18:12.900 --> 18:13.900
legal action.

18:13.900 --> 18:19.180
Make up your own story. That could be a contest maybe, right? Your fanfic. Okay, maybe not.

18:19.180 --> 18:32.180
He was abducted by aliens and went up with Richard Dreyfuss and then they flew away while Steven Spielberg got rich.

18:32.180 --> 18:39.180
Yes, that's it. Anyway, usually we start off the show playing a little bit of how was your week, how was your day.

18:39.180 --> 18:44.180
And we're going to get into that in a little bit. However, I did want to kind of make an exception tonight for this.

18:44.180 --> 18:48.020
Jamie and I were talking about this a little bit before tonight's show, and we thought

18:48.020 --> 18:50.340
we wanted to take a minute to acknowledge this.

18:50.340 --> 18:56.060
If you have had the television on at all today, I'm sure you've heard about this, so we're

18:56.060 --> 19:00.300
probably not the first ones to break this news to you, but Johnny Carson, you know,

19:00.300 --> 19:05.660
the late night guy that was on for many, many, many years, he passed away today.

19:05.660 --> 19:09.140
And we just wanted to take a minute to kind of offer up a moment of silence, because I

19:09.140 --> 19:13.940
don't know about you guys, but for me, I think Johnny Carson is an inspiration to any

19:13.940 --> 19:20.460
sort of talk program ever. I mean, the guy was absolutely hilarious. He was a comic genius.

19:20.460 --> 19:25.180
So many people on his show, so many careers of celebrities that we know today got started

19:25.180 --> 19:31.520
all thanks to his help. And I just want to take a minute to acknowledge Mr. Johnny Carson.

19:31.520 --> 19:40.520
A moment of silence, please. All right, thank you very much. Anything you want to add to

19:40.520 --> 19:48.520
I remember that weird curtain he had. I remember the curtain reappearing in Mallrats.

19:48.520 --> 19:54.520
I remember Ed McMahon. I mean, he's still around, but you know, with the chemistry they had.

19:54.520 --> 20:02.520
Anyway, let's move on and onto the usual stuff we have going on on the show here.

20:02.520 --> 20:07.520
Dick and fart jokes all night long. No, Jamie, how was your week? How was your day?

20:07.520 --> 20:10.640
My week was absolutely shit.

20:10.640 --> 20:13.360
Not for any type of happy fun reason either.

20:13.360 --> 20:17.960
Um...

20:17.960 --> 20:20.080
Oh, our special guest just arrived!

20:20.080 --> 20:24.840
Hello!

20:24.840 --> 20:29.160
It is very a little bit cold outside, isn't it?

20:29.160 --> 20:31.680
Excuse me for a second.

20:31.680 --> 20:35.120
Just so you guys know what's going on, we're just... Oh, say hello!

20:35.120 --> 20:37.760
Mr. Man just picked up the microphone who's getting glomped right now.

20:37.760 --> 20:43.440
Oh yeah, it's that guy called Float Walk and he's got something to say later.

20:43.440 --> 20:45.920
Oh, okay. All right. And?

20:45.920 --> 20:48.080
And his faithful traveling companion, Sharks Girl, who always rides.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.200
Hello, Sharks Girl. Hello, how are you?

20:50.200 --> 20:53.120
Hello, hello. I have presents for you.

20:53.120 --> 20:57.640
Yay!

20:57.640 --> 21:02.220
All right. Woohoo. I'm so excited. Anyway.

21:02.220 --> 21:06.860
I'm sorry, DarkSakura, we'll get to Mel B and SharksGirl in a minute, but I just wanted

21:06.860 --> 21:07.860
to let you...

21:07.860 --> 21:08.860
Thank you for making me feel special!

21:08.860 --> 21:14.460
Well, no, no, no, I just gotta let DarkSakura finish her thought that she was starting with.

21:14.460 --> 21:19.260
My week was, well, it started off really good because I started my new position at work

21:19.260 --> 21:27.340
on Tuesday, making more money, doing cooler stuff, and not talking to people on the phone.

21:27.340 --> 21:34.840
And then, as of Wednesday, I was single for about most of the day, as Lynn literally dumped

21:34.840 --> 21:38.460
that day, yeah.

21:38.460 --> 21:44.580
And things have since been repaired, although it's been a very, very, I'm not, of course,

21:44.580 --> 21:50.260
it's nobody's real business what happened, but I've been very much on edge for this entire

21:50.260 --> 22:05.180
week. And today has been the first good day of my entire week. It's just... I'm not really

22:05.180 --> 22:07.420
going to go into it. It was really, really hard.

22:07.420 --> 22:14.400
It's personal. That's fine. Yeah, but that's really been the entire focus

22:14.400 --> 22:19.120
of my week, although I've played a whole crapload of Castlevania today.

22:19.120 --> 22:26.720
one symphony of the night right on and I had two class orientations spent $118 on

22:26.720 --> 22:31.840
art supplies and I still need to buy another 60 more geez what kind of class

22:31.840 --> 22:40.320
is this for a concept of art design so yeah I have to buy paint next like

22:40.320 --> 22:48.720
watercolors and crap so that's really it for this week so that's why I'm full of

22:48.720 --> 22:53.880
of angst. However, I have rediscovered the joys of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches

22:53.880 --> 23:01.520
made with pineapple jelly.

23:01.520 --> 23:06.180
Shark Scroll is handing out presents. This is awesome. Shark Scroll is giving me her

23:06.180 --> 23:14.320
old Queer Eye for the Straight Guy calendar so I can just turn to April and just hang

23:14.320 --> 23:21.240
up that picture of Jay. I figured you'd like the picture. Anyway, and then also she brought

23:21.240 --> 23:25.840
me a new Xbox Live headset because my other one broke and it's in pieces, so I can play

23:25.840 --> 23:30.800
Halo again. No one's used to not play Halo with me. We'll have a kill Rob Knight on Halo,

23:30.800 --> 23:35.560
that'll be fun. Alright, anyway, moving on. Let's see, Loki, how was your week, how was

23:35.560 --> 23:44.800
today. My week involved lots of Final Fantasy XI, and working on... I rejoined that too.

23:44.800 --> 23:49.760
Oh yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh. Addict! Addict! Oh, you're not an addict. Oh yeah, sure. We'll

23:49.760 --> 23:56.720
cover that later. I'm not an addict. Anyways, then I was working on the orange box at the

23:56.720 --> 24:02.080
moment, and for those who don't know what the orange box is, that's the Xbox case that's

24:02.080 --> 24:08.840
going to have a PC in it. And I spent lots of time dremeling today, and now the case

24:08.840 --> 24:16.960
is, you know, kind of a shell of an old Xbox now. Most of the parts have been ripped out

24:16.960 --> 24:22.400
of it, and I'm just kind of piecing this together. I bought the rest of the parts today because

24:22.400 --> 24:28.120
the hard drive that I had was a laptop hard drive, and it took too much power on the...

24:28.120 --> 24:32.180
I don't want to get too technical, but it took too much power than it needed to, so

24:32.180 --> 24:39.900
I bought a 160 gig hard drive that's a lot faster that will be replacing it, and I don't

24:39.900 --> 24:45.940
know why I need a 160 gig hard drive considering that this, I don't really know what the hell

24:45.940 --> 24:50.060
I'm going to put on it, ROMs, but I don't think it can fit 160 gigs of ROMs, that's

24:50.060 --> 24:52.840
a lot.

24:52.840 --> 24:58.120
And then, um, what else? Oh! Other than that, um, I had a migraine yesterday and that was

24:58.120 --> 25:05.120
lots of fun, and, um, then, oh, that was pretty much it. Yeah.

25:08.880 --> 25:15.560
No, I did not plan how the rape Robin was asleep, but there was this guy, but Nellie

25:15.560 --> 25:22.140
Nellie said she would try for $100, but she- $50.

25:22.140 --> 25:26.460
I was sitting here the other night, we were all sitting around, and Nellie, who is Loki's

25:26.460 --> 25:31.020
other half, was just coming up with all these random hypothetical questions, and they all

25:31.020 --> 25:33.420
had to do with raping me.

25:33.420 --> 25:41.020
Hey, we're going to get that kid named Jagermeister eventually.

25:41.020 --> 25:42.340
Would you rape him in a boat?

25:42.340 --> 25:43.780
Would you rape him on a float?

25:43.780 --> 25:45.260
Would you rape him near or far?

25:45.260 --> 25:47.540
Would you rape him in a car?

25:47.540 --> 25:50.780
But it would be really easy to rape you in your sleep because you sleep a lot on the

25:50.780 --> 25:52.780
couch on your back.

25:52.780 --> 25:57.660
And since 70% of male sleep is spent with an erection, I was thinking I'd just like

25:57.660 --> 26:01.180
sneak up on him and pull his pants down.

26:01.180 --> 26:05.020
And insertion equals rape, so that's like an easy fishing book.

26:05.020 --> 26:08.740
Yeah, but the minute you sit on me, I'm gonna go, AHHH!

26:08.740 --> 26:12.060
It's in already, so it doesn't matter.

26:12.060 --> 26:16.360
Oh my God. You're a sick woman. You're gonna steal my...

26:16.360 --> 26:19.540
I kept... This is the first time we've gotten Nellie to really talk on this show and it's

26:19.540 --> 26:20.620
about raping me.

26:20.620 --> 26:24.460
That's what I do best.

26:24.460 --> 26:28.540
And then she's sitting around trying to get Loki. Would you rape Rob

26:28.540 --> 26:32.340
for a million dollars? Would you rape Rob

26:32.340 --> 26:36.980
for a hundred thousand dollars? Would you rape him for twenty bucks?

26:36.980 --> 26:41.180
And a smile. I love her. Would you rape Rob for a Klondike bar?

26:41.180 --> 26:49.180
Ooh, Klondike Bar. I love Klondike Bars, but no, no, no.

26:49.180 --> 26:56.180
Now the chat room is having their own rhyming contest here.

26:56.180 --> 27:02.180
OrangeLonsRady.com, click on chat. Now Blaze, about me, for a question for Loki here.

27:02.180 --> 27:06.180
Would you rape him in the face? Would you rape him any place?

27:06.180 --> 27:10.180
Laughter

27:10.180 --> 27:14.180
Somewhere Dr. Seuss is crying.

27:14.180 --> 27:18.180
But I offered to split the money with you.

27:18.180 --> 27:22.180
Because I was going to give 50 to you.

27:22.180 --> 27:26.180
Never mind, I was going to get technical and ask, technically what is rape? Does oral sex count as rape?

27:26.180 --> 27:30.180
No.

27:30.180 --> 27:34.180
Moving on to non-raping subjects, at least I hope. Mel B, how was your week?

27:34.180 --> 27:42.180
Uh, there, um, week was a lot of monotony, but then again, when you're working in video games your way, that's really how it goes.

27:42.180 --> 27:46.180
Uh, for those who may or may not know, I actually did not work at Konami at the time.

27:49.180 --> 27:51.180
Okay, just reading these ones.

27:51.180 --> 27:57.180
I'm sorry. Chat room, stop being funny. Stop. Stop being... Okay, I'll say it.

27:57.180 --> 28:06.180
For those that are not into chat, Blaze, the comic genius of Blaze again, can you rape him in the ear? Would you rape him for a beer?

28:06.180 --> 28:20.180
Would you rape him like a duck? Would anyone give a fuck? Would you rape him for five bucks? Would you rape him like a duck? Oh jeez, forget it. Chat room, stop being funny! Stop! Stop!

28:20.180 --> 28:22.180
Okay. Sorry, Mel.

28:22.180 --> 28:28.180
Yeah, actually instead of being at Konami right now, I'm actually working at Namco, of all places.

28:28.180 --> 28:35.180
Which means it's a lot of Pac-Man, and Pac-Man, and Tekken 5.

28:35.180 --> 28:40.180
But it's kind of going along, it's a job, everything is kind of interesting.

28:40.180 --> 28:47.180
And of course, as with any place I go to, there's that one person who watches me play either DDR or 2DX at work.

28:47.180 --> 28:52.420
2DX at work, I usually bring my stuff on break and play user debug stations, and they say,

28:52.420 --> 28:56.220
wow, did you work at Konami or test this game? Like, I didn't test this game, but you know,

28:56.220 --> 29:00.060
I played before and stuff. Like, wow, you must have played DDR2. I'm like, yeah, I played

29:00.060 --> 29:03.420
DDR for a couple years. And he goes, wait a minute, weren't you at that first Metreon

29:03.420 --> 29:07.860
tournament? I'm like, yeah. Wait a minute, what's your name again? Uh, Mel. They're like,

29:07.860 --> 29:12.500
no way, you're not Mel B. I'm like, yeah. Like, dude, let me see your name badge. I'm

29:12.500 --> 29:14.500
This is at work?

29:14.500 --> 29:15.500
This is at work.

29:15.500 --> 29:20.500
Here, guys, like other testers come up to me and like, know me through this stuff and...

29:20.500 --> 29:21.500
Don't you...

29:21.500 --> 29:24.500
You don't have time to be fraternizing on your breaks.

29:24.500 --> 29:28.500
Isn't there a new Katamari Damacy game to be testing in Tekken 5 and all that stuff?

29:28.500 --> 29:30.500
Uh, that'll be later this year.

29:30.500 --> 29:31.500
Alright.

29:31.500 --> 29:32.500
How it goes.

29:32.500 --> 29:35.500
But yeah, we have all sorts of goodies over there right now.

29:35.500 --> 29:37.500
We get to see a lot of PSP action out there, actually.

29:37.500 --> 29:38.500
Ooh, very hot.

29:38.500 --> 29:41.500
Yeah, so it's, uh, those things look pretty sexy, I must say.

29:41.500 --> 29:45.500
They look a lot better than what I remember at E3. I remember that much.

29:45.500 --> 29:50.500
Is Namco going to be putting anything out on the DS? Because damn the DS needs some games.

29:50.500 --> 29:52.500
Uh, yes there is.

29:52.500 --> 29:57.500
Oh yeah, the Pac-Pix thing. Of course. Namco has to whore Pac-Man wherever they can.

29:57.500 --> 30:05.500
Mm-hmm. I mean, yeah, basically the two main sounds you hear out of Namco are waka-waka and ee-ree-ree-wak-wak.

30:05.500 --> 30:08.500
Seriously, that's just what I feel like when I walk around like the whole-

30:08.500 --> 30:12.880
When you walk around the Namco building do you actually do a waka waka waka waka waka waka waka?

30:13.060 --> 30:14.060
What?

30:14.060 --> 30:16.060
Do they have dots on the floor?

30:18.260 --> 30:20.260
I think in one of the old rooms that

30:20.340 --> 30:22.860
Because they just moved buildings, but the old building yes

30:22.860 --> 30:26.240
There was a room that actually had like a Pac-Man light.

30:26.240 --> 30:27.940
Now at Namco can you have drag days?

30:27.940 --> 30:29.940
And you just all come to work with a bow in your hair?

30:32.140 --> 30:37.880
Oh man, they just instituted a dress code out there, so we can't even like you know come in our normal does

30:37.880 --> 30:40.880
Cause we gotta have like collared shirts and we gotta be all prim and proper and...

30:53.880 --> 30:54.880
But yeah.

30:54.880 --> 30:58.880
So yeah, just getting used to the new gig. It's, you know, pretty cool.

30:58.880 --> 31:03.880
Although, you know, after playing a fighting game for eight hours straight it can be tiresome.

31:03.880 --> 31:06.260
or you know when they do something genius like

31:06.260 --> 31:10.100
have me play a two-player mode all by myself for eight hours. Yeah I was reading about

31:10.100 --> 31:12.780
that in the LJ, what's up with that?

31:12.780 --> 31:16.500
I don't know man, they're just geniuses up there, what can I say?

31:16.500 --> 31:20.500
Now I've played two-player versus in fighting games by myself before

31:20.500 --> 31:25.940
but that was like to see all the fatalities in Mortal Kombat, okay? Right, I mean if I want to do something like that

31:25.940 --> 31:28.740
just put me on practice mode, at least there's some kind of

31:28.740 --> 31:33.460
you know, indicator of what you're doing in there, you can actually like practice stuff in practice mode, but

31:33.460 --> 31:34.820
papers

31:34.820 --> 31:36.840
point

31:36.840 --> 31:37.980
but uh... yeah

31:37.980 --> 31:41.280
uh... then then the weekend's been pretty you know it's not yesterday was a

31:41.280 --> 31:43.380
pretty horrible day because

31:43.380 --> 31:45.060
i was going to go to work

31:45.060 --> 31:48.060
now wake up now because i can't find my car keys on mike

31:48.060 --> 31:51.540
but to be going you know i've been so i can just kind of words are searching

31:51.540 --> 31:53.980
replace upside down i'll find it

31:53.980 --> 31:56.580
i can't find my phone to do locked in my car

31:56.580 --> 31:59.700
and so you know

31:59.700 --> 32:01.940
my phone with my car and i didn't have my car keys

32:01.940 --> 32:05.100
and so I'm just like really trippin' and then

32:05.100 --> 32:09.660
so I don't know how to you know contact anyone or anything and it's like

32:09.660 --> 32:12.180
first I didn't want to you know tell

32:12.180 --> 32:16.380
uh... sharks go over here because she knows I'm like the most forgetful person in the world

32:16.380 --> 32:20.580
last thing I needed was more you know amp for fuel for her fire and etcetera

32:20.580 --> 32:22.040
and then uh...

32:22.040 --> 32:23.500
it kinda got to the point where

32:23.500 --> 32:24.460
I

32:24.460 --> 32:28.580
just kinda said okay screw it I'm just gonna call mobile locksmith and yeah I'm just gonna bite the bullet

32:28.580 --> 32:29.500
etcetera

32:29.500 --> 32:34.820
And so what happens is I call the locksmith and he comes on over and he pops my door open

32:34.820 --> 32:38.580
and it was gonna cost about like damn near 300 bucks to get a new key because I have

32:38.580 --> 32:43.060
like a computer chip in my key that's you know certain to the Camaro series of that

32:43.060 --> 32:48.140
year and right when he pops my door open my cell phone goes off and the sharks go and

32:48.140 --> 32:53.940
she calls me and says hey I just found your keys right now in my handbag I'm like no way

32:53.940 --> 32:58.700
so it was all about impeccable timing that night but I was on edge pretty much that rest

32:58.700 --> 33:04.180
of the day and everything else has been pretty chill and today's been just coming up here

33:04.180 --> 33:07.580
and of course Orange Lounge is where I be.

33:07.580 --> 33:10.580
Alright and Pixie?

33:10.580 --> 33:20.740
Well, to say the least, I spent the majority of my week on vacation in Hayward doing butt

33:20.740 --> 33:27.740
ass nothing and driving a truck all day long and, let's see, came back on Thursday night

33:27.740 --> 33:34.740
like, dumb ass bogs. What else do we do? Stop bringing goddamn books! Bitch! Now I won't

33:39.180 --> 33:44.440
talk to you. But anyways, yeah. Is that the new one? Is that the new one? Like, the one

33:44.440 --> 33:50.440
with the Chains of Prometheus stuff in it? I'm sorry. No, I have that one. Nevermind.

33:50.440 --> 33:57.440
And, let's see, Saturday... I mean, I've been boring. We haven't been here very often

33:57.440 --> 33:58.440
just because...

33:58.440 --> 33:59.440
Alright fine, give it the victor.

33:59.440 --> 34:00.440
I'm right here!

34:00.440 --> 34:14.440
Buy me a bottle of Jagger and give me five bucks in five minutes.

34:14.440 --> 34:22.440
Well, Rob, you can open your gift now. This was Angel's idea to give this. Yes, it was.

34:22.440 --> 34:29.440
So I could redeem myself because I flaked twice on you when I said I was going to come by. But you have to read the card first.

34:29.440 --> 34:36.440
I love gifts. This is great. I think every week should be Bring Sky Gifts Week on Orange Lawn.

34:36.440 --> 34:40.440
It wasn't my okay was. I was like, it wasn't my...

34:40.440 --> 34:42.440
Yeah, it was her idea. She spotted it.

Yeah, your ring's in the bag.

35:12.940 --> 35:13.940
Your ring's in the bag, too.

35:13.940 --> 35:25.360

Hello, Annette. This week with my girlfriend was exciting. I loved it. And that was it.

37:00.020 --> 37:01.020
Aww.

37:01.020 --> 37:06.020
Oh, by the way, you can double the ring mold as something to put your dick in.

37:06.020 --> 37:12.020
Oh, my God.

37:12.020 --> 37:13.020
Hey, you.

If you want.

37:14.020 --> 37:15.020
Hey.

37:15.020 --> 37:17.020
That's the mayonnaise one.

37:17.020 --> 37:23.780
It's safe sex.

37:23.780 --> 37:26.860
That mayonnaise does not have spermicide in it.

37:26.860 --> 37:31.060
I like the new microphones.

37:31.060 --> 37:33.900
Oh, I can't wait to go fuck my new rainbow pussy.

37:33.900 --> 37:35.900
I'm so excited.

37:35.900 --> 37:37.220
Bitch.

37:37.220 --> 37:41.660
I love you.

37:41.660 --> 37:44.940
I love you.

37:44.940 --> 37:48.940
We're just too hardcore for G4TV. That's why we'd never be on there.

37:48.940 --> 37:53.940
Okay, anyways.

37:53.940 --> 37:57.940
Our chat room is so lost right now because they're not getting half these references.

37:57.940 --> 38:01.940
But that's alright. No styling. Were you done talking about your week and your day?

38:01.940 --> 38:04.940
I'm rank six.

38:04.940 --> 38:07.940
Are you waving your hand in the air? Waving it like you just don't care?

38:07.940 --> 38:11.940
You might get those girls para-pairing.

38:11.940 --> 38:15.940
I'll get to that in a minute. You got ranked 6 on Final Fantasy, I'm so proud of you.

38:15.940 --> 38:19.940
Oh my, your internet penis is huge!

38:19.940 --> 38:23.940
I have 90 days playing in choirs, I have wasted my life.

38:23.940 --> 38:27.940
Jamie, if you would.

38:27.940 --> 38:31.940
Addict?

38:31.940 --> 38:35.940
You know what, I plan on addicting myself because Ragnarok on Line 2

38:35.940 --> 38:39.940
is not yet out, and I need something to play because I miss Ragnarok

38:39.940 --> 38:44.660
gonna rock so much but I'm so pissed off at gravity right now I actually spent a

38:44.660 --> 38:55.740
whole ten minutes on Final Fantasy 11 yesterday waiting on Rob all right

38:57.020 --> 39:01.340
sharks girl I I just I'm sorry I had to revel in the moment there about Jamie

39:01.340 --> 39:06.380
actually playing Final Fantasy 11 I had to think about that for a minute all

39:06.380 --> 39:08.380
How was your week? How was your day?

39:08.380 --> 39:10.380
Incredibly boring.

39:10.380 --> 39:15.380
I got a new job. I gave my old job two days notice, which made me insanely happy.

39:15.380 --> 39:18.380
Because it was very fun watching them all flip out.

39:18.380 --> 39:25.380
And then I got a contract at Cisco Systems and they have not come to the realization that,

39:25.380 --> 39:28.380
oh, it takes forever for all your passwords to clear and everything.

39:28.380 --> 39:34.380
So I've been sitting there chatting online and playing on my sidekick all week and getting paid for it.

39:34.380 --> 39:39.380
Maybe tomorrow I'll actually do something. That would be kind of a different change.

40:04.380 --> 40:10.440
and by my boss that I'll be a part of it somehow but you have to rape them I do

40:10.440 --> 40:21.040
not have to rape them rape them at a medium pace you have to rape them at the

40:21.040 --> 40:29.120
mall then you have to rape the ball sorry I can it's like this this uh this

40:29.120 --> 40:34.260
uh slogan they used to have for the mall back in Mobile it was you know shop the

40:34.260 --> 40:45.620
the mall, shop them all. It's rape them all, rape them all. Gotta rape them all. So anyways,

40:45.620 --> 40:54.060
yeah, remember that word piss, how funny that was last week? Yeah. No, so anyways, games,

40:54.060 --> 40:58.620
we're gonna be getting in the games business, so that means I can get an E3 using VPD now

40:58.620 --> 41:00.240
and uh...

41:00.240 --> 41:02.340
also um...

41:02.340 --> 41:04.880
hopefully get some free demos

41:04.880 --> 41:08.200
yay demos

41:08.200 --> 41:12.200
shark stroll were you done with your thought before loki so rudely interrupted you

41:12.200 --> 41:16.120
I'm boring this week so

41:16.120 --> 41:19.240
the week before was the more entertaining one but

41:19.240 --> 41:20.040
yeah I'm bored

41:20.040 --> 41:22.400
any highlights you want to share from that week?

41:22.400 --> 41:26.040
I interviewed for the job I'm at now on monday

41:26.040 --> 41:30.600
on the phone. I interviewed in person on Wednesday at 9. I found out I had the job at 1

41:30.600 --> 41:35.720
and got in a car accident at 120. You have this insane luck with car accidents

41:35.720 --> 41:39.160
when you do new exciting things. $1,584 fucking dollars

41:39.160 --> 41:43.120
to fix a bumper and a back quarter panel. That's crap.

41:43.120 --> 41:47.640
That sucks. Luckily, my insurance covered all but 250 of it.

41:47.640 --> 41:51.520
That's decent. And I might get 125 back if I can convince

41:51.520 --> 41:55.080
Geico that because I'm backing out doesn't mean that I have a greater duty of

41:55.080 --> 41:58.160
care to watch that I don't hit him considering he was backing out too I

41:58.160 --> 42:07.880
don't get that one why it's more my fault because you're a woman which

42:07.880 --> 42:12.800
improves the point that a new women can't run stop you're gonna get in

42:12.800 --> 42:22.480
trouble thank you by the way sharks girl for all these tapes I'm getting this is

42:22.480 --> 42:26.960
the entire surreal life season three I got on tape and then the entire first

42:26.960 --> 42:31.000
part of I love the 90s and I just tivo the entire second part of I love the

42:31.000 --> 42:36.640
90s and you'll be getting that and probably that's hot season three flavor

42:36.640 --> 42:47.940
Flava Flav and Dave Couleé and Brigitte Nielsen and Charo and Brian Starr. Oh, and Jordan

42:47.940 --> 42:48.940
Knight.

42:48.940 --> 42:54.720
What else is there? Oh, so you've been doing nothing but playing on your sidekick at work

42:54.720 --> 42:57.320
this week. Does Snoop do his own laundry?

42:57.320 --> 42:58.320
Huh?

42:58.320 --> 42:59.480
Does Snoop do his own laundry?

42:59.480 --> 43:00.480
Yeah.

43:00.480 --> 43:02.960
yeah

43:02.960 --> 43:04.640
all right did you have a comment

43:04.640 --> 43:07.940
are you just waiting at the camera no style

43:07.940 --> 43:11.160
if you want to see the webcam dubbed up dot or is already dot com

43:11.160 --> 43:14.040
uh... moving on it's my turn damage

43:14.040 --> 43:17.280
i want to take a turn i know we still got angel left to go but

43:17.280 --> 43:19.440
uh...

43:19.440 --> 43:25.960
i've got something to say

43:25.960 --> 43:27.620
anyway

43:27.620 --> 43:32.500
My week of my day was okay. I did a whole lot of nothing this week, really.

43:32.500 --> 43:38.060
I played a lot of Final Fantasy XI, just like, you know, my buddy Loki here and

43:38.060 --> 43:41.420
no styling. Last night, though, was very cool. Last night, my buddy,

43:41.420 --> 43:44.340
and they're listening right now, actually, my buddy and his roommate threw a little

43:44.340 --> 43:50.480
dinner party, and I got really drunk. No kidding. I did 20 shots last night,

43:50.480 --> 43:55.580
about. And you guys know what a freaking lightweight I am.

43:55.580 --> 44:15.580
Did you pass out and they put a funnel in your mouth and then they shot the shots down for you?

44:15.580 --> 44:16.580
Did that happen?

44:16.580 --> 44:19.580
You were always falling asleep on the floor.

44:19.580 --> 44:21.580
I fell asleep on the floor like three times in my house.

44:21.580 --> 44:25.700
everybody was doing shots together I was just the biggest pussy with the lowest

44:25.700 --> 44:29.660
alcohol tolerance and so everybody else is still coherent but then like I'd be

44:29.660 --> 44:30.580
like kinda like

44:30.580 --> 44:33.740
slumping on the table going I need to cut myself off

44:33.740 --> 44:40.740
and then they'll put another one in front of me and I'll be all okay and drink it

44:46.900 --> 44:50.460
no thankfully pixie dust is not at the party so nobody was putting makeup on me

44:50.460 --> 44:51.260
make me look pretty

44:51.260 --> 44:54.900
at least you weren't like Vern Troyer in the first episode of surreal life season 4, because

44:54.900 --> 44:57.600
he was naked and pissing in the corner of the weight room.

44:57.600 --> 45:00.420
I was however going, egh, egh, egh, egh, egh, egh, egh, egh.

45:00.420 --> 45:07.380
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

45:07.380 --> 45:11.780
Alright, enough talking about VH1's shows.

45:11.780 --> 45:15.780
Look at that, they're sitting there in the chat room right now and one of my buddies

45:15.780 --> 45:19.160
that was there last night says, yeah, we shaved his ass.

45:19.160 --> 45:20.160
Huh.

45:20.160 --> 45:21.160
Interesting.

45:21.160 --> 45:24.840
Do I check it this morning?

45:24.840 --> 45:27.580
You want to come inspect it?

45:27.580 --> 45:28.580
Get the flashlight.

45:28.580 --> 45:29.580
It's pretty cavernous.

45:29.580 --> 45:30.580
Alright.

45:30.580 --> 45:31.580
Uh.

45:31.580 --> 45:32.580
DDR Angel.

45:32.580 --> 45:33.580
Last but certainly not least.

45:33.580 --> 45:34.580
How was your week?

45:34.580 --> 45:35.580
How was your day?

45:35.580 --> 45:36.580
Well let's see.

45:36.580 --> 45:37.580
Uh.

45:37.580 --> 45:44.540
Classes started this week and normally I'd probably be going uhhh but no.

45:44.540 --> 45:48.760
Actually I, scarily enough I enjoyed myself this week.

45:48.760 --> 45:49.760
That's a little scary.

45:49.760 --> 45:58.880
being enjoyable okay anyway um yeah other than that uh just like everyone

45:58.880 --> 46:06.760
else Final Fantasy 11 and Jamie waiting waiting wait no I'm not gonna say it

46:06.760 --> 46:13.960
anymore okay um and actually I actually split myself between three games now so

46:13.960 --> 46:25.960
So, it's now Final Fantasy XI there, and I've gotten back into Myst. Help. Ah, Myst. Nobody cares about that in this area.

46:25.960 --> 46:29.960
Isn't Myst like 15 years old that game? It's older than God.

46:29.960 --> 46:31.960
Of course, but I had to start-

46:31.960 --> 46:34.960
Yeah, God 16.

46:34.960 --> 46:37.960
I'm not going to comment that I have it for Saturn.

46:37.960 --> 46:45.400
cool um yeah I never got to really like get to play that game so they came out

46:45.400 --> 46:50.760
with a DVD version a little while back so I have all three of those there you

46:50.760 --> 46:55.120
know the first three in the series and then I got the complete Chronicles which

46:55.120 --> 47:04.560
is like a little offshoot of the series as well so I have too many games to play

47:04.560 --> 47:11.560
play and school to deal with, and that's okay. Final Fantasy XI tomorrow, yeah. Or tonight.

47:11.560 --> 47:15.920
I beat it last week. What? What? You can't beat Final Fantasy XI, the game is unbeatable.

47:15.920 --> 47:19.000
At least you can, the original Final Fantasy XI. You can beat the storyline, I played the

47:19.000 --> 47:24.320
storyline. Oh, okay, okay. That was fun. I gotcha. And I watched all of it. Uh-huh. On

47:24.320 --> 47:28.560
the dayward, laying on the bed. Moving on, they can't hear you dear, they can't hear

47:28.560 --> 47:34.200
you. I spent it laying on the bed watching my boyfriend play Final Fantasy XI. How depressing

47:34.200 --> 47:37.480
is that

47:37.480 --> 47:41.760
for my vacation. Were you at least giving him head? The majority of my vacation was

47:41.760 --> 47:45.680
sucked into Final Fantasy 11. Were you giving him head while he was doing it?

47:45.680 --> 47:50.200
Nah, the table's too small. Oh, whoa, hey, ho, ho, hello.

47:50.200 --> 47:53.040
I hit my head. I know. Alright.

47:53.040 --> 47:57.600
Alright. Wow.

47:57.600 --> 48:01.760
Moving on, we're going to go to a break, I think, and in this break,

48:01.760 --> 48:05.880
Now, when we were in that last break there, the chat room was starting to go,

48:05.880 --> 48:09.320
you guys play these songs all the time, can't you play,

48:09.320 --> 48:12.960
play some songs we don't ever hear, what, what's wrong with you guys?

48:12.960 --> 48:16.560
Play some new songs! Fine. So I'm digging into the

48:16.560 --> 48:20.120
obscure stuff, the stuff we don't really play a whole lot, and I'm gonna try and

48:20.120 --> 48:20.920
play some

48:20.920 --> 48:25.120
new stuff that we don't play on Orange Longest Radio a whole lot. Okay.

48:25.120 --> 48:28.920
What we do, but see, we play that one a bit. I, I, I can do that in a later break, but I gotta do

48:28.920 --> 48:29.920
stuff we like, I, I,

48:29.920 --> 48:34.560
that jumps out at me saying we don't really play this. Dig into the bowels of like 2DX substreams.

48:34.560 --> 48:38.480
I'm gonna dig into the bowels here, but what I have queued up right now, I have

48:38.480 --> 48:42.840
the bonus stage from the newest Taiko no Tatujin in Japan. Now I know we've never

48:42.840 --> 48:45.040
played that one because Navi just sent it to me this week.

48:45.040 --> 48:48.960
It's called Koibumi 2000. We're gonna play that.

48:48.960 --> 48:53.320
And then we have from 2DX Red. I know a lot of folks have heard this, but we

48:53.320 --> 48:55.240
haven't played this song on Orange Lounge Radio,

48:55.240 --> 48:58.600
and it has the word fuck in it, so I have to play it. So listen carefully.

48:58.600 --> 49:02.600
But it goes, you have to listen carefully because it goes fook me.

49:02.600 --> 49:06.600
And it's called Injection of Love. And then we're going to play something,

49:06.600 --> 49:10.600
I'm going to play some like old ass Five Key song as well.

49:10.600 --> 49:14.600
So we will be back after this with some rare music

49:14.600 --> 49:18.600
stuff and we'll be back with more Orange Launch Radio after this.

50:18.600 --> 50:28.600
This is the end of the video, thank you for watching and see you in the next video.

51:18.600 --> 51:25.600
What are you telling me, me to let you go You want it, you want it, you want it

51:48.600 --> 51:52.400
Don't fear, since you're running out.

51:52.720 --> 51:55.700
They will kill you

51:55.700 --> 51:58.380
But I won't child.

52:00.480 --> 52:04.680
I won't take you anymore.

52:04.680 --> 52:07.960
hearts

52:07.960 --> 52:10.840
words

52:10.840 --> 52:13.900

54:16.240 --> 54:44.240
So that's why the orange paddle, this video stops, hollers, stop, stop, stop, stop, hollers,

54:44.240 --> 54:52.560
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio and oh my lord there's a gazillion people in the

54:52.560 --> 54:59.500
house now. I think somewhere during that break explicit showed up and Rice Princess and Lanky

54:59.500 --> 55:04.760
Style from Thursday Nights Outside the Box showed up as well. Holy crap there's a lot

55:04.760 --> 55:08.200
of people here. So I guess we might as well continue with the how was your week, how was

55:08.200 --> 55:13.040
your day bit real fast for the people that just got here. Lanky Style, how was your week,

55:13.040 --> 55:21.000
how was your day? Same as always. Worked, slaved over the phone. Working for the devil.

55:21.000 --> 55:26.600
I hear that. Rice Princess, how was your week, how was your day? She said pretty good. That's

55:26.600 --> 55:34.080
a nod off. Uhh, explicit? It's pretty good. Just getting some more replies with the tournament

55:34.080 --> 55:41.320
and actually sending applications on PI for those who cannot pre-register online and stuff.

55:41.320 --> 55:45.320
I just got off of CCL to see what new arcades they have gotten.

55:45.320 --> 55:49.320
Of course, everyone knows they have 6-style there.

55:49.320 --> 55:53.320
And they're replacing one of the DDR machines with the In The Groove machine.

55:53.320 --> 55:57.320
Wait, what? What? They have 6-style at CCL?

55:57.320 --> 56:01.320
No, it's just B-Mania 3. Oh, B-Mania 3. Yeah, I'd heard about that.

56:01.320 --> 56:05.320
Not 2DX.

56:05.320 --> 56:09.320
You know how crowded that's going to be in CCL.

56:09.320 --> 56:11.320
Alright.

56:11.320 --> 56:13.320
The rest will be held in my FUs.

56:13.320 --> 56:15.320
Oh goody goody. Alright.

56:15.320 --> 56:21.320
Moving on. Um, wow guys. Well what can I say in studio here. There's what, like 11 people here? Pull up a floor.

56:21.320 --> 56:25.320
Please try not to fart in studio. We'd appreciate that.

56:25.320 --> 56:35.320
Moving on, I noticed Loki's over on our webcam there at www.orangelandtray.com and he's holding up pieces of this modified Xbox.

56:35.320 --> 56:38.600
Tell us, for the listeners that haven't heard about what you're doing here with this Xbox,

56:38.600 --> 56:41.880
tell us about this little project that you've picked up low-key about modifying an Xbox.

56:41.880 --> 56:46.280
Well, it's not really modifying an Xbox. It's merely just a PC that's going inside of an

56:46.280 --> 56:52.240
Xbox case. It's a micro-ITX PC, which, for those who don't know what those are, they're

56:52.240 --> 56:59.840
really small form factor PC motherboards. They're 17 centimeters by 17 centimeters.

56:59.840 --> 57:04.080
Usually they're fanless, but this one being a 1 gigahertz processor is not fanless, but

57:04.080 --> 57:10.280
They're really fucking small, so you're able to put them in the really small cases, like

57:10.280 --> 57:16.400
the Xbox case here, so it's actually going to have, the way I have it working right now

57:16.400 --> 57:22.080
is it's actually going to run all off a battery. So it's going to be 100% portable. For a monitor,

57:22.080 --> 57:32.080
I'm actually using a portable PlayStation PS1 LCD screen that's 5 inches. All going

57:32.080 --> 57:39.040
gonna be portable though completely 100% nerd hey it's this force so we can you

57:39.040 --> 57:45.600
know do our you know Orange Lawn's radio to go editions from the road from e3 oh

57:45.600 --> 57:49.000
I'm so glad you brought up Orange Lawn's radio to go it's a brand new thing on

57:49.000 --> 57:52.760
our website check it out orangelawnsradio.com click on to go you can download a

57:52.760 --> 57:57.880
very special show that we do every week just for you guys speaking of nerd I

57:57.880 --> 58:03.640
I want to point this out. I'm looking in studio right now and I see one, two, three, four

58:03.640 --> 58:12.720
people playing Nintendo DS. Nerds! Hey, I'm pictochatting with someone sitting right next

58:12.720 --> 58:17.440
to me. Nerds! You know what, I'd be playing DS too, but I left it at my buddy's house.

58:17.440 --> 58:27.400
Whoops, in my jacket. Shame on you. Oh well. Anyway, um, moving on, I want to get to some

58:27.400 --> 58:33.680
actual DDR news, you guys. Actual news about a really big rhythm music game going on right

58:33.680 --> 58:37.780
now. As we talked about a couple weeks ago, there's going to be a brand new DDR game coming

58:37.780 --> 58:43.380
out on the GameCube and it's called DDR with Mario. And we knew that we were going to be

58:43.380 --> 58:47.600
getting some more information on this game after the Tokyo, what was it, the Tokyo Hobby

58:47.600 --> 58:52.280
Fair or something like that that just took place very recently. I screwed up the name

58:52.280 --> 58:57.720
probably. So anyway, this Tokyo Fair just happened, and not only did we get a lot more

58:57.720 --> 59:03.060
information about this game, we got videos. So I'm gonna show some videos in studio right

59:03.060 --> 59:06.880
now, and for those of you on stream, I know this makes for really great radio, but for

59:06.880 --> 59:11.200
those of you on stream, you can actually listen to this over the stream. We'll be playing

59:11.200 --> 59:15.000
this for you guys, and what's really cool is that you can actually hear some of the

59:15.000 --> 59:21.000
music that's gonna be in DDR Mario through this. So I'm gonna play this, and this first

59:21.000 --> 59:26.000
This video should be a song that you guys really recognize, at least I hope so.

59:26.000 --> 59:32.000
And if you want to check out these videos for yourself, just head on over to www.orangelaungeradio.com

59:32.000 --> 59:37.000
and click on the news story that we posted earlier about this.

59:37.000 --> 59:40.000
By the way, thank Dan for those.

59:40.000 --> 59:41.000
Oh, did he find those?

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Dan found those for me last night.

59:43.000 --> 59:44.000
Very nice.

59:44.000 --> 59:52.000
By the way, if anybody happens to have an IGN insider account, please let us know because we need your assistance.

59:52.000 --> 59:59.000
Alright, okay here's one video and listen carefully for the song that's playing in the background. It sounds very familiar.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:01:00.040
Now, I want to point this out in the video. Let me turn this down a little bit, so you

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:04.640
guys can hear the song. In the video, you'll notice that some of the arrows are actually

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:11.440
pictures of Boo, the little Boo. And when you step on that, it makes this giant ghost

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:15.720
appear on your opponent's side that blocks the arrows. So they're incorporating some

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:26.240
of the versus mode stuff in it.

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:32.080
Very interesting there, because you notice that the DDR Max announcer was in that perfect,

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:38.520
you know, all that stuff, very, I don't know if it's Thomas Howard, I don't know, maybe.

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:43.240
The lady's voice in the background we think is just at the show, we don't think it's actually

01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:44.240
a part of the game.

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:47.720
the show but that you could probably hear it in the background that medley

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:50.920
displaying you knew that this would happen in a DDR Mario game it's a dance

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:59.920
version of the Mario Brothers theme from Super Mario 2 or USA first

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:05.400
stage yep so very interesting there now this next one is very interesting I want

01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:09.520
to show you this one the last clip it's clip number four this is one of my

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:13.400
favorites because they actually have Mario and Luigi dancing in it but this

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:17.920
This will allow you to hear one of the other songs that's in the game, and kind of get

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:21.900
a little hint of the gameplay, because you'll notice the arrows aren't only just replaced

01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:25.980
with the boos, but they also have the Goombas and the Koopa Troopas.

01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:26.980
Very interesting.

01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:27.980
Very Nintendo-fied, this game.

01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:30.040
We're going to talk about it a little more here in a minute.

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:35.560
Let me get this other clip cued up here, and we'll watch it in studio, and you guys can

01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:42.560
hear a clip of the song that's going to be in DDR with Mario.

01:02:42.560 --> 01:03:09.400
And in this video they have Para Para girls doing a routine to the song.

01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:20.600
And they have girls caraparing to a basic song on DDR Mario here.

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:26.960
And male DDR fans everywhere have a new masturbatory video to watch.

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:37.280
I just want to point out though, look how Mario dances.

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:49.280
Look at Luigi, he's making waves, he's doing the Watusi.

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:51.280
See, there's a Koopa Troopa that just went up.

01:03:51.280 --> 01:04:20.960
I'm rather impressed that they can pat-a-pat on this too.

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:26.960
very interesting now I realize you guys at home listening right now can't really

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:31.120
see what we're watching but you can get the videos on the website it's got to be

01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:34.800
interesting also to hear the songs there but what do you guys think now that

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:38.000
you've seen a little bit of DDR Mario in action hold on let me tell you guys a

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.840
little bit more information about this game going on basically what's going on

01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:47.360
is that they only were able to check out a demo version of course naturally at

01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:58.680
at the Tokyo World Hobby Fair, they were only able to have a little mini version of the

01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:03.120
game, and here's what the mini version featured, is that it kind of featured only the two player

01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:07.680
mode, and Mario and Luigi were the only playable characters in it, and there were only about

01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:08.680
seven songs.

01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:13.320
And it does talk about that Goomba and Koopa show up as special icons.

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:17.540
When you see a Goomba icon, if you tap the appropriate space on the dance pad, it smashes

01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:18.540
it.

01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:22.560
If you smash a Koopa twice, you'll send it flying back down the column, and it'll knock

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:25.540
out all the other arrows in the column.

01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:30.020
So they've come up with all these interesting little, very Nintendo-like things, and then

01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:33.220
the boo, if you step on the boo, it makes the ghost bigger on the other side, and it

01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:34.220
hides the arrows.

01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:38.020
And then of course, there's a little picture of the dance mat here.

01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:39.020
Very interesting.

01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:44.140
I'm going to head on over to DDRFreak because I know on the thread there over DDRFreak they

01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:46.540
were talking about some of the songs that are actually going to be in it.

01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:51.460
Of course, you heard there the song from Super Mario Brothers Part II, Stage 1 in it.

01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:53.140
What do you guys think after seeing some of those videos?

01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:56.260
Jamie, you were the one that showed me these videos in the first place, what do you think?

01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:58.940
I think it's adorable.

01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:02.780
I think it's cool watching them do the cute little dances and turning around.

01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:03.780
And then the big boo.

01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:08.340
It had the big boo, and I love the big boo.

01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:12.620
I'm quoting from a post here from Unknown Gamer over on DDR Freak.

01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:15.800
It's post number 202 in the GameCube DDR thread.

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:19.580
And they're saying some of the songs that they've translated.

01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:23.580
Let's see, we have Here We Go from Super Mario Brothers, Hoppin' Choppin' from Super Mario

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:29.540
Brothers USA, and then look at this, Para Para Carmen, like the opera Carmen.

01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:30.540
That's wrong.

01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:31.540
A Para Para version.

01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:38.020
Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Mozart in the Pipe, Then Go the U, A Small Night's Music.

01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:43.180
That's the name of the song, then go the pipe.

01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:47.060
Credit there to Unknown Gamer over at DDRFreak for translating some of those and putting

01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:48.440
them in a post there.

01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:50.180
You know my thoughts on this?

01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:51.180
Well, I'll get to my thoughts.

01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:52.180
I want to hear you guys.

01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:53.180
I've talked enough.

01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:54.180
Likey style.

01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:56.460
I just want to know if there's going to be like a mushroom icon.

01:06:56.460 --> 01:07:00.140
If you step on that, it gives like a hallucinogenic effect to the other player or something, you

01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:01.140
know?

01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:05.660
I think the whole game seems like a big hallucinogenic effect.

01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:10.660
Well, what would you expect, though, from this DDR with Mario, honestly?

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:19.660
I think it looks fun. I mean, it'd be interesting to, I think mainly the big thing for me is

01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:24.660
just the music, you know, see what they're going to do with the Nintendo tunes. I think

01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:28.660
they should have, like, a secret, like, other Nintendo characters thing in there, too, though.

01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:31.660
Like, you know, you got Samus, and you get Samus music.

01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:32.660
Samus Samus music?

01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:36.660
Yeah dude, the Samus Shuffle, I don't know.

01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:38.660
Oh dude, the Morph Ball.

01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:41.660
The Morph Ball Slide, I don't know.

01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:44.660
How about Mel, Mel B?

01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:47.660
You've got to admit that Power Power Freestyle was pretty hot.

01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:56.660
Yeah, I must say it reinforces my belief that pretty much Power Power is a female thing and it only looks good that way.

01:07:56.660 --> 01:08:02.660
That said, I mean, looking at the gameplay and stuff, it reminds me a lot of basically just Disney Rave magic on crack.

01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:09.660
Which, you know, is a cool thing. It's like, one of those concepts that Ultramix 2, you know, kind of tried to do with its battle mode and like other gimmicks.

01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:14.660
This one kind of takes it to a more, I guess, recognizable form, which is kind of cool.

01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:19.660
I, it's kind of neat to see the music that, even to hear, you know, what I heard as far as music-wise.

01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:27.660
But, hypothetically, if this comes out to say, you know, to a stateside release, I can't see it doing a whole lot better, you know.

01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:34.660
It's sort of like, you know, just the GameCube phenomenon, they just came a couple years way too late for something like this.

01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:42.660
You know, I don't know though, me personally, I will buy this thing in a heartbeat, because it's total, it's total the stoner DDR, as somebody said in the chat room, no.

01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:51.660
I mean, if you're into DDR and you just want to see something different, you're going to buy it just on that principle, but once you get past that...

01:08:51.660 --> 01:09:00.660
That's what I think is so cool, because there's been a lot of talk, and this got a lot of resistance in the DDR scene at first, when UltraMix 1 first came out.

01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:06.660
It was really trying to separate itself from the rest of DDR, from the Japanese import DDR that we know.

01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:12.100
And then so now you've got these real distinct separations between PlayStation 2, you've got itoy,

01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:17.700
full screen videos, and a lot of that stuff that you see. And then you move over to Ultramix,

01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:25.100
you've got the synth pop music, you've got downloadable packs, online play, and now GameCube has its own version of DDR. It's

01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:30.660
Mario Horde, basically, but no, you know this is going to be the minigame king.

01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:41.660
It does have potential though, so, hey, you never know.

01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:45.660
Yeah, I thought it was really cool. I would probably be one of those people that would be like,

01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:50.660
Ooh, I'm still getting that. Just because it's DDR and it's cute and whatever.

01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:54.660
Did you say one of the songs was called Moats? Moats are on the pipe?

01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:55.660
Something like that.

01:09:55.660 --> 01:09:57.660
Stoner DDR is right, yeah.

01:09:57.660 --> 01:09:59.660
I didn't know Marion Barry was Mozart.

01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:34.660
I don't mean gayest in butt sex, I mean gayest in happy!

01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:39.340
Okay Eminem.

01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:43.020
I mean look at Disney Rave, especially like the U.S. one, Disney Mix.

01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:46.700
Dude, you can't pick that up anywhere for under like a hundred and thirty bucks.

01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:49.420
Oh my god. Yeah, check eBay.

01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:54.140
I found it at Network Video for cheap. Did you get the Japanese or the American one?

01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:56.140
The American one is the one that's going from-

01:10:56.140 --> 01:11:00.140
Oh, I'm talking about the one on the Nintendo 64.

01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:01.140
Oh, that one.

01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:03.140
But I have both of them, anyway.

01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:05.140
Yeah, well, so does Mel. You know, it's no big deal.

01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:10.140
But, you know, it's like, people like different things, and they like the cute Mario Luigi.

01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:12.140
It'll sell. Plus, it's a good way-

01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:14.140
Everyone's always complaining about the exercise factor.

01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:17.140
All the kids in America are so fat and everything.

01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:20.140
This is a good way to get the younger ones playing DDR, which we all know is great exercise.

01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:23.140
Because we all know the kids of America want to be just like Mario.

01:11:23.140 --> 01:11:30.140
That's right! It's the me!

01:11:30.140 --> 01:11:34.140
I just, I really hope Princess Peach is an unlockable character.

01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:38.140
If, in fact, this is my letter to Nintendo.

01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:41.140
Dear Nintendo,

01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:47.140
In the upcoming game, DDR with Mario, I hereby request that Princess Peach be a playable character.

01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:51.140
If this is to be the case, I will play your game every day.

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:53.140
Drunk off my ass. Naked.

01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:30.140
If the only reason you want Princess Peach in DDR is for an upskirt cam, you get that in Super Smash Brothers Melee, my friend.

01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:37.140
And may I also say it sucks trying to play DDR in platform boots. Been there, done that, failed.

01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:43.140
Actually, my first time on a DDR machine was in somebody else's broken in combat boots.

01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:46.120
Was it I was cosplaying as Jill Valentine from Resident Evil

01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:52.900
That was that was pain utter and complete pain

01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:56.660
One of my first times on a DDR machine, especially alone

01:12:56.660 --> 01:13:03.260
I was wearing four inch heels with two and a half inch platform booth and I failed butterfly basic I sucked

01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:09.100
Can't say I've ever played with platform shoes or high heels. Thank goodness. I

01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:13.100
I wish I could say the same, but no, I'm kidding, I haven't.

01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:15.100
Oh wait, Dr. Dick, huh?

01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:17.100
Aha! You funny.

01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:20.100
Hey Rob, I can lend you the boots, I still got them.

01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:21.100
Hey!

01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:22.100
Rob?

01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:23.100
Yes?

01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:25.100
Are you guys still doing comments?

01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:29.100
Yes, Mario, what do you want to say about DDR Mario exclusive?

01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:35.100
Well, I think it's a very good concept. Of course, like everyone says, anything Mario and Luigi would sell, in a way.

01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:41.100
in a way. And with the new DDR pads for like, the GameCube, who knows what they'll do with Mario Party 7, maybe?

01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:51.100
Oh, God. Mario Party 7, I didn't even think about that. What's gonna be the asinine peripheral that's gonna go with Mario Party 7? Probably this.

01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:56.100
Have you seriously played Mario Party 6 with a microphone?

01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:57.100
Yes.

01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:59.100
Move up.

01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:01.100
Goomba.

01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:03.100
Goomba, Mario Party!

01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:12.100
And then you have to go faster, faster, faster, faster, faster, faster, faster!

01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:15.100
Mario Party! Mario Party! Mario Party!

01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:19.100
This is seriously what playing Mario Party 6 sounds like.

01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:25.100
Oh my gosh.

01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:36.780
I know anyways but since I like doggy Konga became like a good a pretty decent

01:14:36.780 --> 01:14:41.060
success seller I think it would this would sell pretty well I wonder whether

01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:44.180
I could do with like some of the features maybe a Cooper's shell during

01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:48.080
while playing the game and potentially lose health maybe sort of like mines

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:53.180
but it's that mania in a way or if they play a damn hard song they actually

01:14:53.180 --> 01:15:07.540
consider pipe raping or so pipe raping what the hell all right moving on I

01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:10.500
think we're gonna go to a break when we come back from this break we're gonna do

01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:13.720
a little more news and then the orange lounge radio cage match when we come

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:19.100
back um you know what I just realized I don't I lost all my pop music nine

01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:22.040
consumer tracks so I got my new hard drive so I don't have that song you

01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:23.040
That's crappy.

01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:25.200
I'm sorry, is there something else you wanted to hear, darling?

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:26.200
The safari.

01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:27.560
Okay, you got it.

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:29.280
The safari.

01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:33.920
We'll be back after this break, featuring, starting it off with the safari, and we'll

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:36.720
be back with the Orange Launch Radio cage match, etc., etc.

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:41.560
Remember, if you want to participate in tonight's cage match, you gotta be in the chat room,

01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:43.160
or else it just sucks to be you.

01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:50.160
We'll be back with more Orange Laundrio.

01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:41.160
Here's the latest, here's the greatest Here's the meaning for the world

01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:44.240
Surf on Fire Ghosts on Fire

01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:47.240
Surf to death the magic words

01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:50.120
You can do it today

01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:52.820
you can do it, you can do it the wrong way

01:17:53.780 --> 01:17:55.480
Even if you will say

01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:58.420
Even if you decide to play the game

01:17:58.420 --> 01:17:59.740
Go on to Heaven

01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:01.980
Burn the repeating

01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:03.840
WWW

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:04.860
Dot Dev Dot work

01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:07.260
Dot go

01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:08.880
Dog my name

01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:10.460
And you'll be as one of there for you

01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:12.960
I'll never feel alone

01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:15.960
W-W-W

01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:18.960
Got-got-got-got-got

01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:21.960
Probably I'll be-come to you

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:23.960
Oh

01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:23.960
Oh

01:21:51.960 --> 01:22:17.640
So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us at Mookawky Orange Lounge Radio.

01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:21.240
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:30.240
Thanks for tuning in tonight boys and girls. Great turnout. Thank you guys. We love it when our ratings get hoarded up. Not only in studio but online as well.

01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:42.240
I think we broke a record in the chat room with well over 40 people in chat. Pretty crazy. And then we got more people in here than I've seen in a long time. This is great. Thank you guys very much.

01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:46.720
We're going to go ahead and open up the Skype line right now if you want to call in to the

01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:47.720
show.

01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:53.360
If you are curious about how you use the Skype line, head on over to www.orangelaungeradio.com,

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:57.400
click on interact with us, and that'll show you how you can interact with the show.

01:22:57.400 --> 01:23:02.360
Now I gotta warn you guys though, I think there might be some issues with the Skype

01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:05.240
line tonight, so we're going to kind of play it on the fly.

01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:09.400
Because I did make some changes to my computer this week, I think there might be some echoes

01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:13.320
when you guys are talking on Skype, and if there is, I apologize, we'll just see what

01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:17.520
happens. We're just going to wing it and try taking a call and see what happens. Hi, you're

01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:23.100
on Orange Launch Radio! It's me, Legend of Zaku. Hello, it's me, Legend of Zaku, how

01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:29.320
are you? Fine, uh, I don't know, in two days we're about to see the new, the new Dancing

01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:33.100
Stage Fusion, so I wonder how, how big is the, you know, the coverage on that going

01:23:33.100 --> 01:23:37.680
to be, because we're going to find out this new hardware and everything about it. Well,

01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:41.560
Dancing Stage Fusion, well you know, very good point you're bringing up, Dancing Stage Fusion is

01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:45.280
supposedly gonna be out this week, so, or we're supposed to get,

01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:48.480
or, no, it's not that it's out, but we get to see it at some expo.

01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:52.760
Tuesday should be, is gonna be, you know, is gonna be debuted in Tuesday in London.

01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:56.920
Right, it's gonna be at that show, right? I was just checking out the boards,

01:23:56.920 --> 01:24:00.520
I mean, I was just checking out the Freak right there, and there's only like a few

01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:01.960
people that are actually going.

01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:05.880
I know one of the mods basically couldn't go that day, but, you know, that's about it.

01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:10.160
You know what? Here's how it works though, Zaku, seriously.

01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:15.040
If one person goes, and one person goes, and one person takes a camera with them,

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:18.000
that's all it takes for this to get all over the internet. And you know some of

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.720
the big gaming sites are going to be there.

01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:22.840
I would say any news...

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:25.880
I doubt Myst and DDR UK would know it would be...

01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:31.000
Well, DDR UK is in a bit of trouble right now, so you're not going to be...

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.880
I'm not going to say you're not going to hear anything from them because I

01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:36.440
I really don't know. I don't run that site. I don't know what they've got planned.

01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:40.840
I don't know if this is going to set people from, you know, from his site and do, you

01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:43.680
know, and post on The Freak, but, you know, we'll just wait and see.

01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:49.480
I'm hoping, you know what, DDR Freak is usually the hub of all the DDR information. Even if

01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:53.760
it gets posted to another site, like, Aaron in Japan usually has a lot of news breaks

01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:54.760
over there.

01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:55.760
Oh, right. I've got to check that too.

01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:59.640
If they break it, it's going to be posted on DDR Freak. That's the beauty of the Internet.

01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:03.240
It's the information superhighway, and we all share the information.

01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:06.280
You will not be left out in the cold with the information, Zaku.

01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:11.640
And anything we find out, Zaku, I assure you we'll bring you next Sunday.

01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:14.200
All right, that's cool. All right. Let me see.

01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:15.600
Anything else?

01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:19.400
Well, I got money for, you know, for buying 2DX, you know, products and basically

01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:20.920
starting to, like,

01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:25.320
you know, start to get into that thing. I just need a great deal on a 2DX controller

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:28.440
and at least, you know, one style that could be affordable.

01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:31.920
I'm gonna spend about a hundred bucks on hold. Let me poll the chat room right now.

01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:34.720
most affordable 2DX controller you've seen lately?

01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:40.120
None of them. Whatever you do, don't buy the triangular looking one.

01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:45.560
Yeah, don't buy the cheap one. You know what? You know what? Don't buy anything but the official stuff.

01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:50.080
I know. You'll be wasting your money otherwise. You get what you pay for.

01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:53.280
If you pay for cheap, you get cheap. And it breaks in five days.

01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:59.480
I'm not getting the rave disc man. I know that I'm not getting the rave disc man.

01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:02.560
I've heard there's no way I'm getting the damn read this man

01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:05.660
by a real controller good at toys and joys what the

01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:08.840
well I get but but you know how they still charge different price I know

01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:13.080
what I am but you know they're 80 bucks I tell my

01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:16.720
no he's not the cost that's cheaper than what I paid for my

01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:20.400
things like 40 bucks I paid a hundred and twenty for mine

01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:23.860
don't complain about eighty dollars so

01:26:23.860 --> 01:26:27.160
well I all I can say shop around exactly

01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:30.160
Go to Toys and Joys, Ha-Mea, Japan Video Games.

01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:37.160
But never order from BuyRight. Never, ever, ever, ever order from BuyRight because they will screw you.

01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:39.160
Without lube.

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:41.160
It will be painful.

01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:44.160
Shop around, Zaku. That's the best you can do.

01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:47.160
Alright, bud. I'm gonna let you go so we can take another call. But thanks for calling in, as always.

01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:48.160
Alright, thanks a lot, man.

01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:49.160
Take care, Zaku.

01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:52.160
Let's go to the next call. I see another line ringing here.

01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:56.160
Hi! You are on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:26:56.160 --> 01:27:00.800
Hey, what's up? This is DJ Rama S from the East Coast. I have a box full of snow for you guys.

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:04.520
Oh, hooray, snow! Because we don't get that here, seriously.

01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:07.840
I kind of figured. What's on your mind, Rama S?

01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:10.960
Ron Ma. Ron Ma.

01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:15.560
I don't know, if you want it to be literal, you can just call him Wild Horse S.

01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:19.280
Because that's what Rama means. How about Rand Mask? You want me to start calling you Rand Mask?

01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:22.280
Sure, Sky. You can call me whatever you like.

01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:26.280
Okay George, no. What's on your mind?

01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:30.280
Not much. I want to know how you guys are doing over there. I want some of that warm weather because I'm freezing here.

01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:34.280
We will put some warm weather in a box and send it to you. How's that sound?

01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:38.280
Even great. Sure, why not? Hey, that works for me boys.

01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:42.280
That works great for me. What's going on on the East Coast scene right now?

01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:46.280
Not much. The average is dealing with the snow.

01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:50.280
We've got like two feet over here. People complaining about the weather, you know.

01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:56.280
Work sucks. People complained that we closed early yesterday, but we were in the middle of a snowstorm. What do you expect us to do?

01:27:56.280 --> 01:28:03.280
I could not imagine anything closing due to snow, but I'm spoiled by California. What can I say?

01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:07.280
Right? Well, no. I would love to be in California for about a good two weeks.

01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:12.280
Now, didn't you come out here for the expo, or am I getting my...

01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:18.280
No, no, no, no. I'm not coming out for Anime Expo, but I am coming out there for Anime Vegas sometime in September.

01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:22.280
Whatever you do, never go to AX because it sucks.

01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:26.280
I have no plans to go to AX.

01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:30.280
I sent some friends of mine out there from the econ reports.

01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:34.280
They said it sucked, so I have no plans to go.

01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:38.280
I was cosplaying Mad Hatter, the last one I went to, walking around in these

01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:42.280
4 inch platform boots that were scary. It made me tall

01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:46.280
though. That was cool. But I was in pain for the whole

01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:56.460
days of the con and then someone tried to break one of my wings one more time

01:28:56.460 --> 01:29:01.940
he didn't hear you I said did you snap their neck or send somebody after them I

01:29:01.940 --> 01:29:05.300
still didn't hear did you snap their neck or send somebody after him to hurt

01:29:05.300 --> 01:29:10.980
him um I did step on somebody's foot in the four inch boots that works for me

01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:15.740
there you go any other thing anything else on your mind no that's it yeah

01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:17.740
Not here you guys, that's all, basically.

01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:19.740
Love the show.

01:29:21.740 --> 01:29:24.740
I already have it pre-reserved at my store.

01:29:24.740 --> 01:29:25.740
Then there you have it.

01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:27.740
Alright, thanks for calling.

01:29:27.740 --> 01:29:28.740
Cheaters.

01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:29.740
Have a good one, buddy.

01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:31.740
We're hearing from all sorts of people.

01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:33.740
Let's do one more call, then we'll get to the cage bench.

01:29:33.740 --> 01:29:35.740
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:36.740
Hey, Sky, it's El Mullet.

01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:38.740
Hello, El Mullet.

01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:39.740
Hello, Sky.

01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:41.740
Oh, he with my favorite nickname on the internet.

01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:43.740
What's up?

01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:48.740
Today's a pretty big day for me. Got to move back into school. I'm in the dorm room right now.

01:29:48.740 --> 01:29:52.740
Ah, dorm life. Duh duh duh. I'm sorry, man.

01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:55.740
I know bad internet connections and all.

01:29:55.740 --> 01:29:58.740
Quick poll in the studio. Who here has lived in a college dorm?

01:29:58.740 --> 01:29:59.740
Just one.

01:29:59.740 --> 01:30:01.740
Me and Jamie? That's it?

01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:03.740
Wow. Oh my God. College dorm.

01:30:03.740 --> 01:30:05.740
Living in the dorm was the best.

01:30:05.740 --> 01:30:09.740
Living in the dorm was horrible. Horrible. I would never wish that upon anybody.

01:30:09.740 --> 01:30:16.660
My dorm was so awesome because, first of all, our person who watched us never really cared

01:30:16.660 --> 01:30:17.660
what we did.

01:30:17.660 --> 01:30:19.080
So my friend had durables.

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:21.940
They were the VCRs.

01:30:21.940 --> 01:30:28.460
And then I also lived within walking distance of a bar slash deli slash arcade that would

01:30:28.460 --> 01:30:33.340
get imports and pirate kits all the time.

01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:35.540
And they were open 24 hours.

01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:36.540
Dang.

01:30:36.540 --> 01:30:38.340
That's pretty nice.

01:30:38.340 --> 01:30:42.740
The only good thing about living in the dorms for me was that I was the only one that had

01:30:42.740 --> 01:30:47.260
a Super Nintendo, so all the boys would come over and play Mario Kart.

01:30:47.260 --> 01:30:51.180
My roommate actually had a Playstation when it came out, and I had a TV and she didn't,

01:30:51.180 --> 01:30:53.660
so we had it hooked up out of VCR.

01:30:53.660 --> 01:30:55.660
I would skip my witchcraft class.

01:30:55.660 --> 01:30:57.500
I took History of Witchcraft.

01:30:57.500 --> 01:30:58.740
I did too in junior college.

01:30:58.740 --> 01:31:03.000
To watch Sailor Moon, as this dates when I lived in the dorms.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:08.020
You know, you're guaranteed college popularity if you have something very obscure.

01:31:08.020 --> 01:31:12.860
I used to, but I didn't quite get to the second half of my story. See, I was popular when

01:31:12.860 --> 01:31:17.740
I had the Super Nintendo, but then when the upstairs guys got the Nintendo 64, nobody

01:31:17.740 --> 01:31:24.560
loved Rob anymore. Nobody loved Rob anymore. Well, the other thing that was cool about

01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:30.500
me living on campus is I had a job on campus. I worked in our pool hall slash arcade. Oh,

01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:34.820
that's cool. And I ran our tournaments and I got, my first time playing as Saturn was

01:31:34.820 --> 01:31:40.220
playing Japanese games. You know what, we, our college built an arcade the year after

01:31:40.220 --> 01:31:45.400
I left. Those cocks. Sucky. I know. Anyway, I'm sorry Elmo, we got sidetracked. What'd

01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:52.280
you call in to talk to us about tonight? I'd call in to talk about various things. Alright.

01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:57.340
DDR Mario, for example. I'm really looking forward to it. Yes, I want to know your thoughts

01:31:57.340 --> 01:32:04.560
on DDR Mario. Well, first of all, considering it's a joint project between Konami and Nintendo,

01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:07.320
I mean, how can that possibly go wrong?

01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:12.980
I know, I'm just a giddy little fanboy thinking about the possibilities when Konami and Nintendo

01:32:12.980 --> 01:32:14.760
join forces.

01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:16.360
This game's going to rock.

01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:21.360
It's going to be really nauseously cute, but it's going to rock.

01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:25.740
It's not going to be your traditional Dance Dance Revolution game, but it's not going

01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:26.840
to be crap either.

01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:31.560
It's going to cater to two different types of niche audiences, and when you bring them

01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:35.720
together, it's only going to branch them both out.

01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:41.680
And those two niche audiences would be kids and Nintendo fanboys? You think?

01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:44.400
Well, that's pretty much the same group, but...

01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:49.520
Well, hey, wait a minute! I'm a Nintendo fanboy!

01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:50.520
Still.

01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:54.440
Alright, any wishes, things you want to see in DDR Mario?

01:32:54.440 --> 01:32:59.440
I want to see a crapload of Konami original

01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:01.440
remixes of Nintendo songs.

01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:06.440
Ooh, you want to see Konami artists remixing Nintendo songs?

01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:10.440
That would rock, like, Soda remixing the Zelda theme or something?

01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:11.440
That would be incredible.

01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:14.440
I need lots of Taku.

01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:16.440
Oh, Jamie wants Taku to come over and remix some stuff.

01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:20.440
Imagine Taku doing, like, the dungeon one from the first Super Mario Brothers.

01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:23.440
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:25.380
Seriously, could you imagine it?

01:33:25.380 --> 01:33:26.520
It'd be pretty hot.

01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:32.180
If I had one wish, I want a dance remix of the Zelda II dungeon theme.

01:33:32.180 --> 01:33:32.880
Oh...

01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:37.500
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do...

01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:38.720
The remake of Super Smash-

01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:39.320
A-a-a-a-a-a

01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:40.020
...

01:33:40.020 --> 01:33:41.360
Jeez!

01:33:41.660 --> 01:33:42.940
Whoa!

01:33:42.940 --> 01:33:44.360
Hahaha!

01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:47.040
Oh, and then we have a comment in the chat room, Miklotov,

01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:50.840
Akira Yumoka better f***ing be in it remixing anything.

01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:51.440
Amen to that...

01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:56.780
Mario happy joy go lucky mix winner is you I mean seriously if he can do like

01:33:56.780 --> 01:34:01.600
bit mania and all that stuff imagine him remixing like a Mario theme I just got a

01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:10.280
boner no no kidding no a kiri amoko remixing music from Luigi's mansion no

01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:16.360
we want music that people have actually heard the music in Luigi's mansion was

01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:19.840
kind of kind of fun spooky yeah but the game was kind of not

01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:24.840
Luigi's Mansion was a great kiddie-tube tech demo.

01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:28.840
That's pretty much it. If it came with the system, it would have been a hell of a lot better.

01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:31.840
But we had to pay $50 for it, so...

01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:34.840
Personally, I think it sucked.

01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:36.840
Duh-dun... get it?

01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:38.840
Oh, okay, because Luigi had a vacuum.

01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:44.840
Oh, my God, why did I call it... LOSER!

01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:51.840
Anyway, um, any other thoughts on your mind, El Mullet, on this lovely sunny evening?

01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:54.840
There are many, many thoughts. Which one would you like me to share?

01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:58.840
Uh, I don't know, um, the third one.

01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:02.840
The third one? I don't know, it's a little risque.

01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:06.840
So I'll just skip to the fourth one and chill out my sight again.

01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:08.840
What? I'm sorry, I missed that.

01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:11.840
I'll just skip to the fourth one and chill out my sight again.

01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:13.840
Okay. Oh, okay, go for it.

01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:20.560
www.insidepulse.com go to the game section and read me specifically and other people because they're awesome

01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:26.060
We only let him whore out that because he whores us out all the time. So we every week

01:35:26.060 --> 01:35:30.480
We I know we appreciate the whoring out buddy. No problem. All right

01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:36.720
We're looking forward to more information on DDR Mario showing up on inside pulse as it comes out. All right. All right. Take care, bud

01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:39.200
Bye later

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:43.520
Dark sakura has an announcement in local news in local news. I

01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:47.760
Put the final nail in the coffin on sack the money today. Oh

01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:52.160
Sack the money is dead and gone and is no more making

01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:58.960
Since you're not gonna say it anymore addict

01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:03.880
But indicate, you know, we love you. I'm not doing this for myself. I'm doing it for you guys

01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:07.880
I know. Because I'm still probably not going to play more than a couple...

01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:10.880
It's group addiction therapy for you.

01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:12.880
I'm still going to be too busy with school.

01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:14.880
I know, it's all good.

01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:17.880
Alright, we're going to... Is that all you wanted to say about it?

01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:22.880
You know what though? I gotta say though, it is kind of sad to see SACBOMANI go bye-bye because it was kind of, you know...

01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:23.880
Not my fault it died.

01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:28.880
I know, I know. It was kind of the way we all got to know each other and I think LiveJournal kind of...

01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:32.880
Not everyone would rather post in the crappy RVGL thread on...

01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:40.880
The cool thing about the Sackbomani forums was that they had like the masturbation thread and things like that, and now people use their live journals for that stuff, so...

01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:42.880
Still have a community.

01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:45.880
In fact, I'm gonna go start a masturbation thread on my live journal right now.

01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:49.880
I can post in my live journal right now, but it just says...

01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:51.880
Just kidding. No, I'm kidding! Gross!

01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:53.880
I'm posting in my live...

01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:55.880
Hey, wait a minute! I'm hot!

01:36:55.880 --> 01:37:00.880
Okay, if you get befriended by me in the next couple days, you know why.

01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:09.880
Wait a minute, is Jamie telling Brad to click the mouse over there?

01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:11.880
No, but we do need to be focused on the chat room.

01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:16.880
Alright, anyway, let's get to the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, shall we?

01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:21.880
Even though I'm totally not ready to do the cage match tonight.

01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:27.040
I need some, I need some more time filler here while I set up for

01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:32.160
Cagematch. Help!

01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:36.240
What is going on over there in the kitchen?

01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:40.720
They're having an orgy in the kitchen.

01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:45.760
Oh boy, alright.

01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:50.040
Okay, I'm ready. Here we go. The Orange Lounge Radio Cagematch, boys and girls.

01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:58.600
The way the cage match works is that we're going to play three songs for you guys.

01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:03.520
You get to vote on your favorite, but you have to be in the chat room in order to vote.

01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:09.540
www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat, and you can make a vote, okay?

01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:14.280
The winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music

01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:18.360
& More program, which plays 24 hours a day, seven days a week on this station when we're

01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:19.360
not live.

01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:22.060
All right, so it's your chance to pick a song.

01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:25.300
Now first off, you get to hear a clip of last week's winner.

01:38:25.300 --> 01:38:27.660
You only get to hear a clip because it was the winner,

01:38:27.660 --> 01:38:28.500
so you already heard it

01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:30.720
because you listen to the show every week, right?

01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:31.700
All right, here it is.

01:38:31.700 --> 01:38:33.100
A clip of song number one.

01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:34.620
And remember guys, you cannot vote

01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:37.100
until all three songs have played in their entirety

01:38:37.100 --> 01:38:38.760
and then we'll tell you how to vote in the chat.

01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:39.600
All right, here it is.

01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:41.080
Last week in the Orange Lounge Cage Match,

01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:44.820
we had a brand new winner, an old favorite, Echo Image.

01:38:44.820 --> 01:38:46.360
And here it is, song number one,

01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:48.280
Echo Image with Endless Day.

01:38:48.280 --> 01:39:14.280
Bring me back inside so we can try Cross an ocean of a mountain, say goodbye

01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:22.280
Reversed while I was sad I could be wrong

01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:31.280
Yes, I had my reasons after all

01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:38.280
Can't find the evidence we're yelling back in time

01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:46.280
This girl is what we always thought of as fun

01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:52.280
Maybe she'll think that we'll find some other way

01:39:52.280 --> 01:40:01.280
Maybe she'll think that we'll find some other way

01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:06.280
And we fall

01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:22.280
In love

01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:47.160
They used to make much sense, but I was wrong

01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:57.660
All right, that was a clip of song number one, Echo Image, Endless Day.

01:40:57.660 --> 01:41:01.120
And now we're going to put it up against two challengers.

01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:04.540
Challenger number one comes to us from Dark Sakura, and you get to hear these songs in

01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:05.540
their entirety.

01:41:05.540 --> 01:41:07.680
Dark Sakura, what's challenger number one tonight?

01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:10.880
Well, it's DJ Bobo, I believe.

01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:15.000
I was at Tapioca Express last night, and they put in a DVD.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.960
And the song was on it, and the video was just really awesome.

01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:22.760
And I instantly fell for this song, so I at least have an opportunity now to share it

01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:23.760
with everybody.

01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:24.760
Alright.

01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:25.760
Anything else?

01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:26.760
No.

01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:27.760
Alright.

01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:28.760
Does there have to always be something?

01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:31.240
No, but I just liked your description of the video.

01:41:31.240 --> 01:41:33.240
Did the video was right?

01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:34.240
Okay.

01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:39.360
The video had this one guy getting onto a subway car, and there was just people of all

01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:42.880
types sitting around, just minding their business, being singular.

01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:49.780
And then he starts handing out beer to everybody, to a nun, to this old man, to this kid.

01:41:49.780 --> 01:41:53.760
And also to everyone's all, oh, we're unified and we like beer.

01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:54.760
Singing.

01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:55.760
Very cool.

01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:56.760
Over beer.

01:41:56.760 --> 01:41:57.760
Very cool.

01:41:57.760 --> 01:42:01.040
I want to see the video at some point, no matter how, I haven't really heard the song,

01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:04.000
so no matter how good or how bad the song is, I still want to see the video.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:08.040
I need to, I'm going to actually go back and ask them what the name of the DVD is because

01:42:08.040 --> 01:42:09.040
I want to buy it.

01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:10.040
Very cool.

01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:14.720
Bye to Angel, Pixie Dust, No Stylin, Rice Princess, and Lanky Stylin are all leaving.

01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:17.720
It's emptying out in here!

01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:19.640
The Orgy's going somewhere else, well thanks for coming guys.

01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:21.160
They're relocating to the wild.

01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:24.280
I think it's amazingly funny that we have the longest drive of all and we're staying

01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:25.280
to the end.

01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:27.680
Cause you're troopers, you're real fans, Sharkscroll Mel B.

01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:31.760
We are hardcore like the Peach Pits.

01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:34.360
Alright let's get to Jamie's song, here it is.

01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:37.280
DJ Bobo with I Believe.

01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:41.280
I believe. DJ Bobo, I believe. Song number two in tonight's cage match. Enjoy.

01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:55.780
Hold on. Small glitch there. Sorry guys. Let me start it over here. Sorry about that.

01:42:55.780 --> 01:43:02.780
We've got to bring up the audio levels. Here it is, song number two, DJ Bobo, I Believe.

01:43:25.780 --> 01:43:28.780
I believe in dreams

01:43:28.780 --> 01:43:31.780
I believe in heroes

01:43:31.780 --> 01:43:36.780
And this is not a gun

01:43:36.780 --> 01:43:43.780
I believe in faith in knowledge I can learn

01:43:43.780 --> 01:43:51.780
I believe all what you give you can return

01:43:51.780 --> 01:43:57.780
And I'm afraid we place our life in other people's hands

01:43:58.780 --> 01:44:04.780
I'll realize on earth we're all the same, we need a chance

01:44:04.780 --> 01:44:07.780
I believe in visions

01:44:08.780 --> 01:44:10.780
I believe in love

01:44:12.780 --> 01:44:14.780
I believe in magic

01:44:15.780 --> 01:44:17.780
But this is not enough

01:44:17.780 --> 01:44:39.620
I believe in life there's more than wrong or right

01:44:39.620 --> 01:44:49.620
I believe in colors, there's no black or white

01:44:49.620 --> 01:44:56.620
And you don't know what you have got until you say goodbye

01:44:56.620 --> 01:45:02.620
But in my dreams one day I spread my wings and I will fly

01:45:02.620 --> 01:45:27.620
I believe in visions. I believe in love. I believe in magic. This is not enough. I believe in freedom. I believe in dreams. I believe in heroes.

01:45:27.620 --> 01:45:34.620
But this is not enough, this is not enough

01:45:37.620 --> 01:45:45.620
I believe, I believe my dream can be reality

01:45:47.620 --> 01:45:52.620
I believe my time on earth is destiny

01:45:52.620 --> 01:45:55.460
Oh I believe

01:45:55.460 --> 01:45:57.940
Oh I believe

01:45:59.540 --> 01:46:02.540
That we are strong and us

01:46:02.540 --> 01:46:04.060
Oh I..

01:46:04.060 --> 01:46:06.460
I believe

01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:08.900
We are strong

01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:11.320
and me as a nation

01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:13.620
I believe

01:46:13.620 --> 01:46:16.220
That we are strong

01:46:16.220 --> 01:46:18.500
I believe

01:46:18.500 --> 01:46:19.700
I believe

01:46:19.700 --> 01:46:21.320
This life is.

01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:33.320
We are strong and I believe in freedom We are strong and I believe in heroes

01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:48.660
All righty guys, that was song number two. That was DJ Bobo with I Believe. Do we believe

01:46:48.660 --> 01:46:51.060
in this song? Let's find out. Jamie.

01:46:51.060 --> 01:46:56.100
I was just transfixed by this video. So, I'm sitting there eating my tater tots and curry

01:46:56.100 --> 01:47:01.100
at Tab X and I'm like, ooh, so I give it a ten.

01:47:01.100 --> 01:47:03.100
Alright, who's got the mic? Sharks Girl!

01:47:04.100 --> 01:47:07.100
I grabbed the mic to send it to other people, okay!

01:47:08.100 --> 01:47:11.100
Actually I liked it, it was pretty messy. I kinda want to see the video actually.

01:47:12.100 --> 01:47:18.100
It was happy, yay, I have to give it a number, huh? 8.395

01:47:19.100 --> 01:47:20.100
8.395 from Sharks Girl.

01:47:21.100 --> 01:47:22.100
Explicit.

01:47:23.100 --> 01:47:28.100
I actually dig the music. It's still pretty smooth. I would say 8.5.

01:47:28.100 --> 01:47:37.100
Kind of throws me back to the late 90s type stuff, techno type stuff.

01:47:37.100 --> 01:47:41.100
Kind of sounds like No Mercy except a lot less falsified.

01:47:41.100 --> 01:47:45.300
Um, I'll give it a 7.92.

01:47:45.300 --> 01:47:51.300
Alright, um, for me personally, I definitely grew up singing the mid-90s thing as well,

01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:57.940
like an inspirational, I can do anything type, like, yeah, I believe I can fly, like dance,

01:47:57.940 --> 01:48:02.380
I don't know, it's like an inspirational, which is why I'm thinking about Jamie describing

01:48:02.380 --> 01:48:06.980
the video a little bit before and I'm like, that totally goes against that song.

01:48:06.980 --> 01:48:12.960
no it was about it was like a unity I believe everybody getting together over

01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:13.360
beer

01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:15.880
all right well I'm not supposed to we're not supposed to take the videos into

01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:16.440
account

01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:20.980
during this case also the song strictly so it was I like the throwback aspect of

01:48:20.980 --> 01:48:21.940
it and it left me

01:48:21.940 --> 01:48:26.620
it left me feeling hopeful and inspirational and making me wanna pray

01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:30.620
so I give it a 6.66 no I gotta get something higher than that

01:48:30.620 --> 01:48:35.540
an 8.666 I believe I was bored

01:48:35.540 --> 01:48:43.060
so I get to seven. You know he's got to have his lame pun or it's just not a show. Alright,

01:48:43.060 --> 01:48:50.860
here we go. Song number three from Loki. I was going to put in the girls remix. I was

01:48:50.860 --> 01:48:56.020
told in the chat room to do it, I was told by Jamie to do it, but my judgment, you know,

01:48:56.020 --> 01:49:01.180
said no, that would be wrong. So I'll do it next week if this doesn't win. This is, um,

01:49:01.180 --> 01:49:05.360
I don't know for how many of you out there have seen the Sin City trailer.

01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:08.680
This is a song playing in the background except that's the instrumental version.

01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:13.560
This is The Cells by a group called The Servant.

01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:16.600
Alright, song number three, The Cells by The Servant.

01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:23.600
Sounds goth-y. We'll see. Enjoy!

01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:53.600
My skin feels like orange peel My eyes are peed, my vacuum sealed

01:49:53.600 --> 01:50:01.600
My organs move like a swarm of eels We should be more adventurous the way they

01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:07.600
feel They annoy me, they'll still employ me

01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:10.600
They could destroy me, they should destroy me

01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:13.600
We ain't Chinese, I'm funny

01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:18.600
Look for each other in the TV screen

01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:22.600
I'm your self and it's time to stand

01:50:22.600 --> 01:50:25.600
I'm your self and it's time to stand

01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:31.600
All I do, I wanna do is you

01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:35.600
Every day and that's my day

01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:38.600
That's my day and that's my little risk

01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:44.600
All I do, all I wanna do

01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:53.600
Sissy skin, they move on mass

01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:56.600
Like a rash on the back of a manky cat

01:50:56.600 --> 01:50:59.600
Now in I go, like a fool

01:50:59.600 --> 01:51:04.600
I can't resist dipping in the pool

01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:07.600
Watch them, watch me, watch them too

01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:11.600
Across the street, across the realm

01:51:11.600 --> 01:51:14.600
I dress myself like a charcoal sketch

01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:18.600
My eyes are brown and my head's red

01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:22.600
They annoy me, they'll soon employ me

01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:25.600
They could destroy me, they should enjoy me

01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:28.600
We ain't Chinese, up on me

01:51:28.600 --> 01:51:34.600
To live for each other and to see me scream

01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:41.600
The sun goes up and the sun goes down

01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:44.600
The day has come and soon will come

01:51:44.600 --> 01:51:49.600
For us to all understand

01:51:50.600 --> 01:51:53.600
Every day and every night day

01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:55.600
Every day and every night day

01:51:55.600 --> 01:52:04.080
Come right here, all I do, I wanna see you

01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:07.280
I don't trust that it's time to tell

01:52:07.280 --> 01:52:10.640
I drag myself into the town

01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:16.320
All I do, I wanna see you

01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:35.320
The sales I am at the moment will soon die But I will be here, oh I'll still be here

01:52:35.320 --> 01:52:41.320
The sales I am at the moment will soon die

01:52:41.320 --> 01:52:43.320
But I will be here

01:52:44.460 --> 01:52:48.460
Oh, I'll still be here

01:52:50.940 --> 01:52:53.940
Oh, you're the one who's out there

01:52:53.940 --> 01:52:55.940
The sun will tell

01:52:55.940 --> 01:52:58.940
Let myself into the shadows

01:52:58.940 --> 01:53:04.940
All I do, I wanna be here

01:54:04.940 --> 01:54:17.260
Alright, that was song number three, The Servant with the Cells.

01:54:17.260 --> 01:54:20.820
Let's see if that was Good Cells or Bad Cells.

01:54:20.820 --> 01:54:21.820
Jamie.

01:54:21.820 --> 01:54:22.820
Mitochondria.

01:54:22.820 --> 01:54:23.820
It's like Parasites.

01:54:23.820 --> 01:54:24.820
I don't know.

01:54:24.820 --> 01:54:33.820
I don't know if I liked it or not.

01:54:33.820 --> 01:54:40.820
I would listen to it if I were doing something else, but I wouldn't just listen to it and it definitely wouldn't go in my car.

01:54:40.820 --> 01:54:42.820
So it gets 5.

01:54:49.820 --> 01:54:53.820
It made me very mellow and I kind of liked it. I think I'd like to listen to it a little bit.

01:54:53.820 --> 01:54:55.820
Um...

01:54:55.820 --> 01:54:59.320
I want to say a 7.12398.

01:55:03.820 --> 01:55:06.320
I don't know, I just didn't feel the music too much.

01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:10.320
I mean, it's a good song, but I just didn't feel it in a way.

01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:11.820
I'd say 6.8.

01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:17.320
It's quite a pretty good ambiance, actually.

01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:20.820
I mean, it's not something I would bump in my system or nothing like that,

01:55:20.820 --> 01:55:24.820
but it kind of has a very, kind of a dark theme to it, obviously.

01:55:24.820 --> 01:55:31.820
It kind of throws me to the Silent Hill 4 type music. I was thinking it actually. I'd give it a...

01:55:31.820 --> 01:55:40.820
Although when you talk about wild products expecting something wild, I'll give it an 8.12.

01:56:01.820 --> 01:56:09.100
I give it like a six and a half you have to see this with the trailer it is goddamn

uh... or is already dot com click on chat in the meantime

01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:48.500
low-key

01:57:48.500 --> 01:57:50.640
how about that sim scene

01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:54.220
how about it's not going around for much longer that's for sure

01:57:54.220 --> 01:57:57.260
uh... so the big news this week was

01:57:57.260 --> 01:57:59.500
ddr uk was shut down

01:57:59.500 --> 01:58:05.080
why was shut down voluntarily and here is why voluntarily because

01:58:05.080 --> 01:58:06.660
the uh...

01:58:06.660 --> 01:58:12.140
uk equivalent of the r-i-a-a came after them and says

01:58:12.140 --> 01:58:16.100
Currently, the site has been placed into a temporary state of closure. This is a direct

01:58:16.100 --> 01:58:22.000
response to communication from the IFPI in regards to a variety of links and files that

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:27.120
were available from the site. No direct legal action is being raised and this action has

01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:32.540
been voluntarily undertaken. We hope for normal service to resume soon. Now, there's a little

01:58:32.540 --> 01:58:41.080
bit more to go along with that. And apparently, this was posted in, it was posted on my cell,

01:58:41.080 --> 01:58:48.080
but it was actually posted from the Game Facts boards. Let's see if I can find this real quick here.

01:58:48.080 --> 01:58:57.080
It's basically a run down, kind of a quick little fact of what's going on in regards to why the site was closed and yada yada.

01:58:57.080 --> 01:59:08.080
I do know, well, the site was taken down voluntarily. They haven't pressed charges. It's due to the response for the official files that were on there.

01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:13.680
on there. So, you know, obviously they got in trouble for that. Where's the link here?

01:59:13.680 --> 01:59:24.200
Let's see. Now there were some other interesting things on that, like, I wish I could really

01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:36.000
find this. Where is it? Anyways, it's basically, they got the logs of everyone that downloaded

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:40.920
that crap so they don't know what exactly that's gonna entail as far as

01:59:40.920 --> 01:59:45.760
you know all the people have downloaded this stuff you know whether they're

01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:49.240
gonna get in trouble or whatnot lucky for me I don't download off that site at

01:59:49.240 --> 01:59:53.840
least none of the official stuff and not from there now the other thing though

01:59:53.840 --> 02:00:00.280
which was interesting and this is in regards to but my cell they're talking

02:00:00.280 --> 02:00:08.920
about taking down their sim file thing, too. Here we go. No, that's not it. And basically,

02:00:08.920 --> 02:00:14.520
no, the same reasons. Oh, okay, here we go. The DDRUK legal proceedings fact. It says,

02:00:14.520 --> 02:00:19.360
what happened to the site? DDRUK was recently contacted by the IFPI regarding legally held

02:00:19.360 --> 02:00:23.400
music recordings being distributed on the site. The recordings in question were the

02:00:23.400 --> 02:00:28.160
official sim files from Konami's Dance Dance Revolution game. How'd they find out? Officially,

02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:35.160
Unfortunately, we do not know. Unfortunately, unofficially, the AFPI website allows anonymous reporting of copyright infringement.

02:00:35.160 --> 02:00:45.160
Since the downloads are only accessible by registered members, it is likely a DDRUK site member contacted the IFPI and gave them details of the files being stored.

02:00:45.160 --> 02:00:49.160
Uh oh, they must have banned somebody and they didn't like that.

02:00:49.160 --> 02:01:02.160
Anyways, what's going to happen to the site? Right now we do not know. Miss is currently unreachable and is currently in discussions. The site is down for the moment and is likely to remain that way until later dates.

02:01:02.160 --> 02:01:09.160
Currently unconfirmed. Is Miss facing a fine or jail time? This is the guy that runs the site.

02:01:09.160 --> 02:01:13.580
No, Ms. has given full cooperation with the authorities.

02:01:13.580 --> 02:01:20.640
They have requested that, requested the BitTorrent tracker statistics from his site logs.

02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:26.560
Whilst recent database errors have erased most recent data, it is understood that a

02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:31.400
log of all uploading and downloading has been done through the site, including user names,

02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:32.640
profiles, and IP addresses.

02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:38.920
In return, he has, he is avoiding any punitive action and says, what will happen to the users?

02:01:38.920 --> 02:01:44.120
this we do not know, aside from the fact that Ms. has complied with the request, we do not

02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:51.120
know what action, if any, the AFPI intends to take and this will be updated as, you know,

02:01:51.120 --> 02:01:53.640
they know more.

02:01:53.640 --> 02:01:59.600
Comment from the chat room, coming from same, says that fact is fake and I'm sorry but I

02:01:59.600 --> 02:02:03.220
tend to agree because I wouldn't believe that goddamn thing I would read on the game facts

02:02:03.220 --> 02:02:04.220
message boards.

02:02:04.220 --> 02:02:19.220
Well, whatever. Okay, all we know... I... Well, here's the thing that also was suspicious of me, is the BitTorrent files, they aren't on that server. They're on ddramerica.com, which also got shut down, but that's another thing entirely.

02:02:19.220 --> 02:02:24.220
I think this is just a scare tactic, honestly. I don't... I mean, come on, people!

02:02:24.220 --> 02:02:33.220
It's frickin' DDR sim files. They're not even often the full songs. They're little cut-down versions of these full songs.

02:02:33.220 --> 02:02:43.220
If they were really gonna do lawsuits against the users of DDR UK, don't you think everybody that's ever used Supernova would be extremely fucked right about now?

02:02:43.220 --> 02:02:50.220
I mean, seriously, you can download, you could have downloaded way more stuff, full CDs off Supernova, Dark Sakura.

02:02:50.220 --> 02:02:55.220
Some of us still download full CDs off of Bytor.com.

02:02:55.220 --> 02:02:59.220
Yeah, they really shut down Supernova there, it's like a completely, anyway.

02:02:59.220 --> 02:03:00.220
Besides the Supernova here.

02:03:00.220 --> 02:03:06.220
So basically, yeah, the whole scare thing's going on right now, everyone's, you know, in pandemonium or whatever.

02:03:06.220 --> 02:03:11.220
Now the other thing that happened this week is there's yet another character created, and this character...

02:03:11.220 --> 02:03:21.220
But even if they're trying to catch us or anything like that, we can always file back a counter lawsuit for invading our privacy and stuff.

02:03:21.220 --> 02:03:24.220
That's why...

02:03:24.220 --> 02:03:27.220
I think you're more just getting into international messiness.

02:03:27.220 --> 02:03:32.220
I think it's just international messiness. I think somebody's pulling your leg over on GameFAQs, I honestly do.

02:03:32.220 --> 02:03:37.220
Like it's RIAA crap, they lost the lawsuit with the MP3s and shit, so...

02:03:37.220 --> 02:03:46.220
I mean, because when you get into the international stuff, because Canada frickin' was upheld in court that the people sharing files were protected in Canada.

02:03:46.220 --> 02:03:52.220
So, if you're a Canadian user that downloaded off of DDRUK, you'll get off scot free, but if you're an American user, hey, you're going to be screwed.

02:03:52.220 --> 02:03:54.220
I don't know. Anyway.

02:03:54.220 --> 02:03:58.220
Because it's the IPI, it's not the RIA.

02:03:58.220 --> 02:04:15.220
As I was mentioning, dancing character, I have to show Rob, obviously this is not good radio because you can't see it, but this is something you would think I would have made. But I didn't make it, so anyways.

02:04:15.220 --> 02:04:23.920
Okay, a description for those at home. Basically, somebody has created a DDR character for StepMania

02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:30.880
that is a naked girl, well, a topless girl, and her boobs in full glory and wearing tight

02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:35.480
little panty bottoms or something she's got there, little skirt bottom. What is the name

02:04:35.480 --> 02:04:39.240
of this character and where can the little boys who want to masturbate to it? Oh, I love

02:04:39.240 --> 02:04:44.360
that! Did you see on the upskirt cam? You can see her little punani on the little upskirt

02:04:44.360 --> 02:04:49.760
did you see that? It was a little dark spot in the shape of a triangle. Okay, where can

02:04:49.760 --> 02:05:03.120
the boys get this? Well, it's been taken down due to, I guess, bandwidth issues. But, it

02:05:03.120 --> 02:05:10.320
can be found, there was a thread on DDR Freak in the sim file section that you could find

02:05:10.320 --> 02:05:19.880
this. I luckily searched Google and in a cache page I found the link here, which I will later

02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:27.420
post to, I'll post the link in OrangeLaunchRadio.com where you can find it, which I'll upload to

02:05:27.420 --> 02:05:33.440
my site or something. That was the first thing I noticed is that you could see her cootie

02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:39.200
box when it was going up the skirt there. I can't believe you guys missed it. Jamie's

02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:48.200
kind of, now Jamie's even got that curious look on her face. Oh. Anyway.

02:05:48.200 --> 02:05:55.320
That's ridiculous. Where is my pantsless rage? Seriously, where's our pantsless rage, our

02:05:55.320 --> 02:06:03.960
boydancers pervs so yeah enough of that I I don't remember where I got it but is

02:06:03.960 --> 02:06:10.680
some guy made it and I'm sure if you look over in if you search for like

02:06:10.680 --> 02:06:15.840
black and oh is it step mania character or or it's like I'll remember it's just

02:06:15.840 --> 02:06:21.480
whatever they posted in the one thread I found it pretty easy but I will post it

02:06:21.480 --> 02:06:28.480
a link, um, it will be in our forums to where you can find the wonderful StepMania, um,

02:06:28.480 --> 02:06:36.920
character. Yeah. Anyways. Um, so that's pretty much all that's going on right now. Just a

02:06:36.920 --> 02:06:43.680
whole bunch of scaring, you know, scared people and that kind of thing. But, I should mention,

02:06:43.680 --> 02:06:48.960
because we haven't mentioned it yet, um, big news will be coming this week regarding Dancing

02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:54.080
Stage Fusion, the 25th through the 27th. We're going to be finding out all about that. So,

02:06:54.080 --> 02:07:02.680
couple things. Exciting. I don't know what else to say. You're still giggling over there,

02:07:02.680 --> 02:07:06.760
explicit. You're like a little 12-year-old boy who just saw boobies on the TV for the

02:07:06.760 --> 02:07:16.740
first time on HBO. Dude, change of channel 9, it's the breast exam girl. Actually, this

02:07:16.740 --> 02:07:23.620
This brings up a good topic. I would like to go around the room. You don't have to participate

02:07:23.620 --> 02:07:28.060
if you don't want to. But I want to talk about the first time you ever saw the naughty bits

02:07:28.060 --> 02:07:42.420
of the opposite gender. Dark Sakura.

02:07:42.420 --> 02:07:46.620
is kind of embarrassing mm-hmm but there was this little there was a kid I played

02:07:46.620 --> 02:07:50.140
with in my neighborhood and I was nine and he thought that one day it would be

02:07:50.140 --> 02:08:01.300
funny to pull down his pants and I told his mommy and got him spanked that's hot

02:08:01.300 --> 02:08:06.580
it was our next-door neighbor this is when I used to run around carrying my

02:08:06.580 --> 02:08:16.660
gizmo everywhere my little gremlins doll gizmo huh but seriously that was my

02:08:16.660 --> 02:08:22.220
first exposure and I thought it was incredibly stupid

02:08:22.660 --> 02:08:34.700
all right my mommy my mom had no idea how to explain to me anyway anyway Mel B

02:08:34.700 --> 02:08:38.700
You guys don't have to participate, I'm just talking to whoever's got the mic.

02:08:38.700 --> 02:08:41.700
First time seeing live naughty bits, man.

02:08:41.700 --> 02:08:46.700
I mean, okay, like all media aside, gosh.

02:08:46.700 --> 02:08:54.700
I don't know, I think by the time I had seen live ones, I had been so desensitized by all the porn that my dad hid underneath his bed in the cab.

02:08:54.700 --> 02:09:01.700
It really wasn't anything new to me other than like, okay, it's about time I saw this live, you know, it's 3D and...

02:09:01.700 --> 02:09:03.700
3D?

02:09:03.700 --> 02:09:07.940
yeah I mean it was like they didn't have any of that rad 70s porn with the glasses

02:09:10.020 --> 02:09:13.780
and there weren't any cool like you know rainbows in the background or like you know little stars

02:09:13.780 --> 02:09:19.700
flying around I mean but I guess it was a treat to see like you know nice little shadows and like

02:09:19.700 --> 02:09:26.100
things just wow there's texture to them and oh they're cold or wow it's it was

02:09:27.060 --> 02:09:31.300
yeah yeah the first time I've ever seen them was in my it was in my truck and it was in the back

02:09:31.300 --> 02:09:38.300
of the cab, and it was a very cold night. We had to keep each other warm somehow.

02:09:38.740 --> 02:09:41.620
Anybody else care to go, explicit?

02:09:41.620 --> 02:09:45.660
If coming out of your mom's vagina is a cow.

02:09:45.660 --> 02:09:48.900
Not quite there, buddy.

02:09:48.900 --> 02:09:55.900
Alright, okay, I was one years old. Okay, actually I don't even remember what the hell

02:09:56.260 --> 02:10:01.260
happened when I was one. Okay, let's go the year when I was three years old.

02:10:01.260 --> 02:10:09.900
Okay, I come to the bathroom, someone rushes to the shower, naked, I was like, holy shit,

02:10:09.900 --> 02:10:14.180
what is this?

02:10:14.180 --> 02:10:19.940
And what, and what, and what is head growth your, and what is head growth down there?

02:10:19.940 --> 02:10:22.580
Wow, this is getting interesting.

02:10:22.580 --> 02:10:24.860
Did I really want to bring up this topic?

02:10:24.860 --> 02:10:25.860
I don't know.

02:10:25.860 --> 02:10:27.700
Hey, you're the one who brought it.

02:10:27.700 --> 02:10:35.100
You know what? I dated girls in high school and that's how I saw boobs. Like Mel, you'd

02:10:35.100 --> 02:10:39.260
seen it on TV enough times, it was just like, oh, now I've got them live and in person.

02:10:39.260 --> 02:10:46.700
But really, you know, sad enough. But now, remember ladies, I'm gay. But the first time

02:10:46.700 --> 02:10:54.940
I saw the lower equator was actually at a strip bar. My girlfriends were always virginal

02:10:54.940 --> 02:10:59.940
and peer and, you know, didn't want to show that, you know, so.

02:10:59.940 --> 02:11:02.940
I see.

02:11:02.940 --> 02:11:07.940
Well, boobs are one thing though. I mean, hell, if you're in Europe, hey, boobs are just nothing else, you know.

02:11:07.940 --> 02:11:12.940
Anybody else want to go? Low key.

02:11:12.940 --> 02:11:17.940
This is easy. I assume this is the first time in live.

02:11:17.940 --> 02:11:22.940
It was sixth grade. They were doing presentations in my class

02:11:22.940 --> 02:11:31.640
for, um, before, um, we were studying Roman history or something like that. No, it wasn't

02:11:31.640 --> 02:11:39.720
Roman history, we were reading, um, no, we were reading, um, I want to say it was like,

02:11:39.720 --> 02:11:45.140
not Julius Caesar, no, um, something to do with Greek and Romans, we were studying history

02:11:45.140 --> 02:11:50.520
or something, and there was a presentation being done in the class, and, you know, people

02:11:50.520 --> 02:12:14.520
All in front of the class.

02:12:14.520 --> 02:12:28.120
Oh yeah, we're supposed to talk about games on this show. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. Games

02:12:28.120 --> 02:12:35.000
that little kids play. Alright, let's go to a break guys. When we come back from the break

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.760
we're going to do the FUs of the week, we're going to talk about who won the cage match

02:12:37.760 --> 02:12:42.660
and who knows, whatever else we feel like. We're going to do whatever the hell we please,

02:12:42.660 --> 02:12:46.900
basically here on Orange Lounge Radio. So you just be ready for it.

02:12:46.900 --> 02:12:49.340
We'll be back after this.

02:12:49.340 --> 02:12:53.900
I decided we'd do a break of some DDR songs, some pretty well-known DDR songs.

02:12:53.900 --> 02:12:58.140
And just for Jamie, I made the first song by Taku.

02:12:58.140 --> 02:13:01.780
And it's one we haven't played in a while. So starting off, we have Era

02:13:01.780 --> 02:13:02.960
Starting off the mix.

02:13:02.960 --> 02:13:09.960
we'll be back

02:18:02.960 --> 02:18:24.840
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

02:18:24.840 --> 02:18:29.140
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

02:18:29.140 --> 02:18:34.140
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

02:18:34.140 --> 02:18:37.840
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio. Thank you guys for sticking with us.

02:18:37.840 --> 02:18:41.440
We're getting into the last hour of the show here. We have plenty of stuff coming up,

02:18:41.440 --> 02:18:44.240
including some favorite segments you've come to know and love.

02:18:44.240 --> 02:18:48.040
We gotta get one of those segments taken care of, though, and that would be the cage match.

02:18:48.040 --> 02:18:49.740
You guys wanna know who won tonight's cage match?

02:18:49.740 --> 02:18:51.040
Uh-huh.

02:18:51.040 --> 02:18:54.560
I have to give props to the chat room. Lot of people voting

02:18:54.560 --> 02:18:58.120
tonight's cage match. Very pleased to see a lot of participation from the chat room tonight

02:18:58.120 --> 02:19:01.600
and you know what? Once again, one vote

02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:04.680
separating not only the winner from the second place song

02:19:04.680 --> 02:19:07.720
but from the third place song as well. It was that

02:19:07.720 --> 02:19:12.760
freaking close tonight. So here it is. The winning song of tonight's cage match

02:19:12.760 --> 02:19:18.160
is...

02:19:18.160 --> 02:19:27.760
Echo Image with Endless Day, one more time, very, very close, one vote, any other direction

02:19:27.760 --> 02:19:32.980
would have made all the difference, so very nice, thank you for participating you guys,

02:19:32.980 --> 02:19:40.440
and we'll do it again next week. Alright, moving on, you know, we're kind of, you know,

02:19:40.440 --> 02:19:44.680
getting into the last hour of the show, we really only have what, FUs, Ask Orange, Lounge,

02:19:44.680 --> 02:19:49.460
left to go, right? You know the usual bits. Well, we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we get

02:19:49.460 --> 02:19:53.040
bored and we're looking for things to talk about on the show because, you know, if we

02:19:53.040 --> 02:19:57.920
don't talk about DDR, there'll be people out there that go, man, that Orange Lounge

02:19:57.920 --> 02:20:06.920
Radio sucks. They don't ever talk about DDR. They talk about the first time they saw boobs

02:20:06.920 --> 02:20:11.720
or penises. They're all gay. What's wrong with them?

02:20:11.720 --> 02:20:15.720
You know chat room, you're really missing something without being able to see Rob's face while he does this.

02:20:15.720 --> 02:20:20.720
Well, I can talk about both at once. Man, everybody at Orange Lounge Radio is gay.

02:20:20.720 --> 02:20:25.720
It's a big gay station. Everything about it is gay.

02:20:25.720 --> 02:20:29.720
You mean unhappy?

02:20:29.720 --> 02:20:34.720
So, in an effort... Where is that rainbow cake, man? What kind of hug is this?

02:20:34.720 --> 02:20:39.720
Oh, how fruity. In an effort to, you know, warm ourselves up more to the DDR community,

02:20:39.720 --> 02:20:45.840
we seek inspiration from posts from ddrfreak

02:20:45.840 --> 02:20:48.960
oh god no

02:20:48.960 --> 02:20:50.520
that's right

02:20:50.520 --> 02:20:57.520
it's time for the ddr chit chat post of the week

02:20:58.320 --> 02:21:01.880
since you know we are syndicated now on ddrfreak radio you know we gotta give a

02:21:01.880 --> 02:21:03.700
shout out to our

02:21:03.700 --> 02:21:06.600
our fellow friends over at ddrfreak so

02:21:06.600 --> 02:21:08.200
we're working together

02:21:08.200 --> 02:21:14.600
with the Freak by stealing one of their topics for one of our own. So here it is, the DDR

02:21:14.600 --> 02:21:20.000
topic of the week. Here it is guys, and we, y'all are going to have to answer this, okay,

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:29.560
here it is. Subject of message, what are tournaments like? And that's the entire message right

02:21:29.560 --> 02:21:34.280
there. It says C title in the message. So, Jamie, what are tournaments like? Hell on

02:21:34.280 --> 02:21:41.200
earth oh come on the thing is how the past ones I've been to I've had a hand

02:21:41.200 --> 02:21:48.080
in running hell on earth and you don't eat all day now we're talking about DDR

02:21:48.080 --> 02:21:52.280
tournaments I didn't talk about DDR turn now well now wait a minute though there

02:21:52.280 --> 02:21:55.480
was the one tournament we had in Sacramento where a lanky style and rice

02:21:55.480 --> 02:22:00.520
princess were running the kitchen with deep-fried Twinkies I had half of one so

02:22:00.520 --> 02:22:02.520
So you did get to eat that day.

02:22:02.520 --> 02:22:04.520
That's all I needed to eat all day.

02:22:06.520 --> 02:22:09.520
Explicit, what are DDR tournaments like?

02:22:09.520 --> 02:22:11.520
Heaven or hell.

02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:22.520
The good thing about tournaments is, of course, you get to meet with a lot of people, chit-chat, and compete so you can feel welcome to see how your skills match up with others.

02:22:22.520 --> 02:22:25.520
Are you better than everybody else or not?

02:22:25.520 --> 02:22:31.520
Some tournaments actually serve food, but I'm currently in a tournament I'm organizing called Sacktown Smackdown

02:22:31.520 --> 02:22:33.520
Not piss!

02:22:33.520 --> 02:22:35.520
We don't need to go back there

02:22:35.520 --> 02:22:37.520
I'll talk to you about that

02:22:37.520 --> 02:22:41.520
Talk to Mel about it another time, I'm not bringing that subject back up this week

02:22:41.520 --> 02:22:43.520
Okay, okay, back on topic

02:22:43.520 --> 02:22:47.520
And the tournament is just to meet the organizers

02:22:47.520 --> 02:22:53.520
And for those who are lonely they can visit the opposite sex if that's possible

02:22:53.520 --> 02:22:57.520
Okay, as for the hell part, this is where I get cranky.

02:22:57.520 --> 02:23:00.520
People bitch about the fucking pads.

02:23:00.520 --> 02:23:03.520
Oh, wow, the up-air doesn't work.

02:23:03.520 --> 02:23:06.520
Well, that's too bad. If it doesn't...

02:23:06.520 --> 02:23:09.520
We only say that if it doesn't work immediately.

02:23:09.520 --> 02:23:13.520
You gotta have a step up. No matter how many pounds of pressure put on it.

02:23:13.520 --> 02:23:17.520
But I've seen people complain because they tap it very lightly and you get a miss.

02:23:17.520 --> 02:23:21.520
Oh, wow, you got a miss. So what? Focus more. Don't give up.

02:23:21.520 --> 02:23:25.840
saying what oh my god you screwed me over on the fucking tournament or

02:23:25.840 --> 02:23:29.880
complaining about the rules and of course you get the butt-raping drama

02:23:29.880 --> 02:23:36.240
that's been going around and shit Oh NorCal versus SoCal oh wow what's that

02:23:36.240 --> 02:23:41.560
what that what what big of a deal is it? Seattle versus everybody! NorCal versus SoCal ain't no rivalry man

02:23:41.560 --> 02:23:45.400
especially Freestyle that's a one-sided ass whooping that ain't a rivalry oh

02:23:45.400 --> 02:23:49.520
dear oh dear he's starting something okay that's what I'm getting to in the

02:23:49.520 --> 02:23:54.520
freestyle section. You know, freestyle is always about opinions. You can't complain

02:23:54.520 --> 02:23:59.440
saying you deserve first place or second place. Unless you got something that's a tournament

02:23:59.440 --> 02:24:04.680
that's favoring one side or the other. If that is the case, they shouldn't even be judges.

02:24:04.680 --> 02:24:09.600
Of course Mel B knows what kind of tournaments those have been.

02:24:09.600 --> 02:24:12.440
Alright Mel B, I gotta ask Mel B though. Oh I'm sorry.

02:24:12.440 --> 02:24:15.720
I'll continue the address to Mel B. Okay, Mel B, because you've won a couple

02:24:15.720 --> 02:24:19.080
tournaments and you've had a hand in judging and putting together some what

02:24:19.080 --> 02:24:29.600
are tournaments like? Payday. It's Mel Ego B everybody. As far as I'm concerned

02:24:29.600 --> 02:24:33.400
there's two things that I know when I have a good tourney. I come out paid and

02:24:33.400 --> 02:24:41.720
when I'm done back home there are panties on my drawer. I don't know it's

02:24:41.720 --> 02:24:46.200
kind of hard to say if obviously if we're going back about five years ago

02:24:46.200 --> 02:24:50.320
tournaments were like a big thing because like you know we were trying to

02:24:50.320 --> 02:24:54.520
promote the game we were trying to like get people aware of this and so like no

02:24:54.520 --> 02:24:57.320
I mean we took tournaments seriously we figured you know we had to put our best

02:24:57.320 --> 02:25:00.840
foot forward to make this game look good and say like hey this is something

02:25:00.840 --> 02:25:05.320
everyone can enjoy and all that good stuff and so it was sort of fun but when

02:25:05.320 --> 02:25:08.160
I got to my first tournament I won and like by that I think that just kind of

02:25:08.160 --> 02:25:11.040
like maybe see tournaments a whole different way like I had to go out there

02:25:11.040 --> 02:25:13.400
and I had to win, I wasn't out there to,

02:25:13.400 --> 02:25:14.760
I mean, yeah, I was out there to have fun

02:25:14.760 --> 02:25:16.120
and, you know, socialize and promote it,

02:25:16.120 --> 02:25:17.520
but when all was said and done,

02:25:17.520 --> 02:25:20.080
I didn't drive down five hours to LA to be second place

02:25:20.080 --> 02:25:22.460
or to be, you know, to have a good show.

02:25:22.460 --> 02:25:23.300
Oh, snap.

02:25:23.300 --> 02:25:24.120
You know, screw that.

02:25:24.120 --> 02:25:27.960
But, so yeah, after all, you know, tourneys,

02:25:27.960 --> 02:25:29.240
you know, yeah, I got bigger prizes,

02:25:29.240 --> 02:25:31.680
got my solo machine, got my popping music controller

02:25:31.680 --> 02:25:34.060
at the last tourney, which is pretty dope, by the way.

02:25:34.060 --> 02:25:35.420
Thank you, desktop arcade.

02:25:36.800 --> 02:25:38.440
I would say as far as organizing a tourney,

02:25:38.440 --> 02:25:40.200
those things are not fun.

02:25:40.200 --> 02:25:45.560
Yeah, organizers are not that great. I think perfect attack attorneys are fucking boring as hell

02:25:46.680 --> 02:25:48.680
because it's I it's

02:25:49.800 --> 02:25:52.560
Yeah, there's just basically nothing new you can put to PA

02:25:52.560 --> 02:25:58.280
I mean, yeah, you could put on different modifiers, but then it's like you're not really gauging someone's perfect attack ability

02:25:58.280 --> 02:26:02.880
You're gauging their improv, you know, they're they're sight reading more or less, which is not a bad thing

02:26:02.880 --> 02:26:05.480
I mean, it's something that should be tested at the same time

02:26:05.480 --> 02:26:13.480
It's kind of just kind of gone to the wayside. It's boring in my opinion. At least with freestyle, there's that chance you can see something new and something cool.

02:26:13.480 --> 02:26:19.480
But tournaments are pretty fun if you just don't hang around the venue too long.

02:26:19.480 --> 02:26:31.480
DDR tournaments for me are about bringing a lot of Febreze and a Super Soaker to give some of these kids a bath.

02:26:31.480 --> 02:26:52.480
No, I'm kidding. Actually, I'm not. But, you know, DDR tournaments, it's all about community to me, and I could give a shit about who's winning the tournament, and I've participated in tournaments, and I've lost big. I've done decent in some as well, but to me, yes, to me it's about making people know who I am.

02:26:52.480 --> 02:27:02.480
And I'll tell you what, after the March Madness where we had DDR Idol, you know who I am.

02:27:02.480 --> 02:27:08.480
It's about making your DDR penis as big as possible.

02:27:08.480 --> 02:27:10.480
We need to do DDR Idol again.

02:27:10.480 --> 02:27:14.480
Are you actually going to come back or is Dr. Forrest going to come back?

02:27:14.480 --> 02:27:19.480
The good doctor is thinking about it. You just need something to get him out of the closet again.

02:27:19.480 --> 02:27:32.480
Remember that in my tournament, you guys do improv with a prop, that's a new thing I'm putting up for freestyle. Improvision with a prop.

02:27:32.480 --> 02:27:35.480
I'll talk to the good doctor about it, we'll see what he comes up with.

02:27:35.480 --> 02:27:38.480
Or you're probably saving up for DDR History X.

02:27:38.480 --> 02:27:45.480
I don't want to beat the Dr. Dick thing into the ground though, I'm only going to use him on a rainy day.

02:27:45.480 --> 02:27:48.480
How can you not?

02:27:48.480 --> 02:27:53.480
We'll see, we'll see. Alright, uh, SharkSkrull, anything you wanted to add to this discussion?

02:27:53.480 --> 02:28:03.480
What is a tournament like? Yes. Okay, find my friends, jabber jabber jabber, have they started yet? Jabber jabber jabber, another hour. Have they started yet? Jabber jabber jabber.

02:28:03.480 --> 02:28:09.480
Oh, there's a routine, who's on? Oh, we just missed the entire thing, oh well. That's it.

02:28:09.480 --> 02:28:14.480
And most of the time it involves doing something completely unrelated to DDR, like actually mini-golfing.

02:28:14.480 --> 02:28:19.500
By the way, SharkSkrull and I met for the first time at a DDR tournament.

02:28:19.500 --> 02:28:20.900
Just jabber jabber jabber.

02:28:20.900 --> 02:28:21.900
That's right.

02:28:21.900 --> 02:28:24.800
Cause DarkSakura and I were pissed that we screwed up on PA.

02:28:24.800 --> 02:28:25.800
So we talked...

02:28:25.800 --> 02:28:26.800
No, I met you before the PA.

02:28:26.800 --> 02:28:28.080
Cause I remember you guys went to go get the bats.

02:28:28.080 --> 02:28:29.080
That's...

02:28:29.080 --> 02:28:30.080
Yeah!

02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:31.080
Remember?

02:28:31.080 --> 02:28:32.080
And the toy horns.

02:28:32.080 --> 02:28:35.320
But I remember we screwed up on PA so bad and we got your input on what we should do

02:28:35.320 --> 02:28:36.320
for the freestyle.

02:28:36.320 --> 02:28:40.840
And then like, me, DarkSakura, IguanaGirl, I remember we all went to the Rite Aid and

02:28:40.840 --> 02:28:43.940
we got the bats and we did the Stomp to My Beat routine, which was the best routine I

02:28:43.940 --> 02:28:48.500
was ever a part of by the way. Now the funny thing is I remember when I met you, and I

02:28:48.500 --> 02:28:52.100
know I've told you this, but I'll tell the entire world this, my first two thoughts when

02:28:52.100 --> 02:29:00.340
I met Rob. Wow, he's hot. Wow, he's gay. In that order, at that speed. Thank you. Thank

02:29:00.340 --> 02:29:09.820
you, honey. I'm blushing. Stop, girl. See, you know what I'm talking about? Tournaments

02:29:09.820 --> 02:29:13.900
being good for my ego. Anyway, uh, Loki, anything you want to add about DDR tournaments?

02:29:13.900 --> 02:29:28.500
The, um, well, they're long and boring. Yeah, that's my take on them. They're like, um,

02:29:28.500 --> 02:29:36.740
watching Titanic. It's like you keep expecting something, you keep expecting something cool

02:29:36.740 --> 02:29:41.500
to happen, and someone says that there's something really good about it, but you just don't see

02:29:41.500 --> 02:29:46.820
it no matter how long you watch it, and after you're done, you want your three hours back,

02:29:46.820 --> 02:29:55.360
so that's pretty much, you know, pretty much how it is. Oh, and you know, you expect something

02:29:55.360 --> 02:29:58.460
major to happen, like, you know, Leonardo DiCaprio to die, but then you find out he

02:29:58.460 --> 02:30:04.500
just was acting, so, so it's like... And then, you know, we're all shocked to find out the

02:30:04.500 --> 02:30:05.500
The boat sinks.

02:30:05.500 --> 02:30:06.500
Oh my!

02:30:06.500 --> 02:30:09.500
Thank you for ruining it for me, Rob!

02:30:09.500 --> 02:30:13.760
Something completely unexpected happens, like the same people winning the tournaments all

02:30:13.760 --> 02:30:14.760
the time.

02:30:14.760 --> 02:30:15.760
That's wonderful.

02:30:15.760 --> 02:30:16.760
It's alright.

02:30:16.760 --> 02:30:21.720
The doctor's going to make a comeback.

02:30:21.720 --> 02:30:22.720
Just you wait.

02:30:22.720 --> 02:30:26.100
Alright, anyway, let's move on.

02:30:26.100 --> 02:30:28.860
So that was our DDR Freak post of the week.

02:30:28.860 --> 02:30:29.860
There you have it.

02:30:29.860 --> 02:30:31.780
Our DDR chit-chat post of the week.

02:30:31.780 --> 02:30:41.780
If you keep posting over in DDR Freak on the DDR chit-chat boards, your post, if it's interesting enough, could be fodder for the show.

02:30:41.780 --> 02:30:42.780
Alright, moving on.

02:30:42.780 --> 02:30:44.780
Fodder for our ridicule.

02:30:44.780 --> 02:30:47.780
Let's get into the FUs of the week.

02:30:47.780 --> 02:30:51.780
Jamie, why is it that we have to do these FUs every single week?

02:30:51.780 --> 02:30:54.780
Because life is a big stinking pile of shit.

02:30:54.780 --> 02:31:17.200
An F.U. goes toward the entirety of my week since Wednesday for getting 3 hours of sleep

02:31:17.200 --> 02:31:20.060
in as many days

02:31:20.060 --> 02:31:24.380
uh... for being an emotional wreck for the past few days

02:31:24.380 --> 02:31:26.680
uh... and if you too

02:31:26.680 --> 02:31:30.880
uh... basically almost having to go find my own damn apartment

02:31:30.880 --> 02:31:36.040
uh... to being harassed by the cops at Denny's

02:31:36.040 --> 02:31:41.480
over an open confrontation

02:31:41.480 --> 02:31:42.300
it's not funny

02:31:42.300 --> 02:31:44.080
it's really serious

02:31:44.080 --> 02:31:46.540
uh...

02:31:46.540 --> 02:31:48.820
just F you to all that

02:31:48.820 --> 02:31:52.260
and having to compromise

02:31:52.260 --> 02:31:54.420
for a worthy cause

02:31:54.420 --> 02:31:56.860
that's it, that's all I'm gonna say

02:31:56.860 --> 02:31:58.940
alright then we'll move on to

02:31:58.940 --> 02:32:03.340
Loki

02:32:03.340 --> 02:32:06.820
first off, thank you to myself for having to buy another fucking hard drive for

02:32:06.820 --> 02:32:08.580
this god damn computer

02:32:08.580 --> 02:32:12.020
because I didn't calculate the voltage

02:32:12.020 --> 02:32:14.380
needed for these things so

02:32:14.380 --> 02:32:17.980
you know one rail of the power supply would have been maxed out if I bought

02:32:17.980 --> 02:32:22.540
this other things basically you plug in a USB anything and the computer crashes

02:32:22.540 --> 02:32:26.320
so that would have sucked but I got a larger hard drive out of it now I have

02:32:26.320 --> 02:32:30.420
this really small 30 gig laptop hard drive that I have no fucking clue I'm

02:32:30.420 --> 02:32:35.820
gonna do it and fuck you this goddamn slow people in front of me today while I

02:32:35.820 --> 02:32:41.020
was coming home you were literally driving like 20 miles an hour and 50

02:32:41.020 --> 02:32:45.380
mile an hour area. I drive by you and guess what, you're old.

02:32:45.380 --> 02:32:48.460
There's a shocker. Seriously,

02:32:48.460 --> 02:32:52.140
honestly, driving slower will not get you...

02:32:52.140 --> 02:32:55.380
will not let you live longer, basically.

02:32:55.380 --> 02:32:58.620
You cannot slow down time. So please,

02:32:58.620 --> 02:33:02.180
drive the speed limit or faster. May I add one?

02:33:02.180 --> 02:33:06.020
A few people with halogen headlights, thank you. Oh yes,

02:33:06.020 --> 02:33:10.140
I'd like to second that. Nothing that I like more than having the sun

02:33:10.140 --> 02:33:15.840
staring at me through my back window you know cuz I'm glad you can see five miles

02:33:15.840 --> 02:33:19.840
in front of you but I can't even see two feet in front of me because your lights

02:33:19.840 --> 02:33:25.020
are burning my retinas I'm sorry but you know I fucking hate all these trucks

02:33:25.020 --> 02:33:29.280
with like fog lamps and shit on them they have so much you know fucking light

02:33:29.280 --> 02:33:34.360
coming out of them I literally I could see them cutting a hole in the fog you

02:33:34.360 --> 02:33:39.440
know literally just evaporating right in front of them it's just nuts no wonder

02:33:39.440 --> 02:33:43.300
their tears fucking, you know, get hit by cars because they stare into the headlights.

02:33:43.300 --> 02:33:50.300
They like literally go blind. They're just like brain shocked. So that fucking sucks.

02:33:51.900 --> 02:33:55.820
And just basically, you know, fuck you do, this stupid Dremel attachment that I have,

02:33:55.820 --> 02:34:02.820
this little flex shaft thing that supposedly allows you to use a Dremel tool in like really

02:34:02.940 --> 02:34:09.220
tight places and stuff. But the goddamn thing, you know, I put the bit inside of it and it

02:34:09.220 --> 02:34:15.040
threw the god damn saw blade out at me so that sucked

02:34:15.040 --> 02:34:22.040
I don't want to hear any of your giggling over a flex shaft in tight places

02:34:22.040 --> 02:34:24.720
the hell with you people

02:34:24.720 --> 02:34:31.560
you're saying about talking about putting things in tight places in this crowd

02:34:31.560 --> 02:34:34.960
I know, that sounds like fun girl

02:34:34.960 --> 02:34:40.960
And a Final Fantasy-related, um, F.U. to this guy named Warchief, who is a complete moron,

02:34:40.960 --> 02:34:43.960
who I literally think is retarded, and doesn't speak English.

02:34:43.960 --> 02:34:47.960
So... Way to go, retarded people.

02:34:47.960 --> 02:34:50.960
D'oh! Final Fantasy fun!

02:34:50.960 --> 02:34:53.960
So, um...

02:34:53.960 --> 02:34:54.960
Yay.

02:34:54.960 --> 02:34:56.960
So, the hell with all that.

02:34:56.960 --> 02:34:59.960
Um, yeah, really, it's been a pretty, um, decent week, though.

02:34:59.960 --> 02:35:06.960
I'm done.

02:35:09.960 --> 02:35:15.360
Uh, an F.U. to my mouse that just decided to die on me while, uh, so I can't control the

02:35:15.360 --> 02:35:19.800
show right now except with the keyboard. So this is gonna be an interesting, uh, second

02:35:19.800 --> 02:35:22.940
half of the show. I, I've just gotta go run and get the spare battery, so I gotta keep

02:35:22.940 --> 02:35:29.560
my F.U.s kinda short. Um, F.U. to the Valero that just opened up, uh, uh, literally across

02:35:29.560 --> 02:35:32.160
the street I don't know if you notice they've been building a gas station

02:35:32.160 --> 02:35:35.440
across the street just to set this up the orange lounge studios are in the

02:35:35.440 --> 02:35:39.360
middle of fucking nowhere okay and they just finally built a gas station like

02:35:39.360 --> 02:35:42.780
literally right across the street from us but now it has a mini-mart and of

02:35:42.780 --> 02:35:46.740
course these mini-marts are gonna be freaking marked up to all hell but it's

02:35:46.740 --> 02:35:51.000
so convenient so now I'm gonna end up paying like five dollars for 12 pack of

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:57.740
Pepsi because well shit it's right across the street and I'm lazy also an

02:35:57.740 --> 02:36:02.980
FU to my low alcohol tolerance but you know I think I think I did pretty good

02:36:02.980 --> 02:36:06.300
this week all things considered and that's all I'm gonna say we're gonna

02:36:06.300 --> 02:36:09.620
move on moving on who's got the mic over there yeah I guess we might as well

02:36:09.620 --> 02:36:14.180
start it off with explicit remember it's a three-hour show buddy all right good

02:36:14.180 --> 02:36:20.300
did it from the previous weeks have not been saying F use a big F you goes to

02:36:20.300 --> 02:36:26.060
almost everybody who keeps calling that my goddamn term it's pissed just cuz it

02:36:26.060 --> 02:36:30.060
Just cuz some people spell this Paradise Island, Sacktown Smackdown.

02:36:31.060 --> 02:36:35.060
Doesn't mean it is called piss, just called Sacktown Smackdown.

02:36:36.060 --> 02:36:39.060
Since when did we have a piss attack?

02:36:40.060 --> 02:36:41.060
Ooh, I'm on a perfect...

02:36:41.060 --> 02:36:45.060
I don't know, the first Sacramento attorney I remember was called Scat, so...

02:36:46.060 --> 02:36:48.060
That was not my idea.

02:36:48.060 --> 02:36:56.300
But on an odd enough note, I actually found two of the scat t-shirts in my closet while

02:36:56.300 --> 02:37:00.860
looking for stuff, so maybe we'll fill it out as a surprise.

02:37:00.860 --> 02:37:04.460
T-shirts from the bottom of my closet.

02:37:04.460 --> 02:37:05.460
The mouse is fixed.

02:37:05.460 --> 02:37:06.460
Thank you.

02:37:06.460 --> 02:37:14.300
Another F.D. ghost is someone putting a fucking glass, a fucking, um, snowy ball on the fucking

02:37:14.300 --> 02:37:15.300
road again.

02:37:15.300 --> 02:37:17.300
What am I supposed to do, rush?

02:37:19.300 --> 02:37:26.300
Don't fucking ask. I drive back and forth every day and I see someone throw a damn bottle out of nowhere.

02:37:26.300 --> 02:37:28.300
Who the hell do you think you are?

02:37:28.300 --> 02:37:34.300
This used to be the rush of $1,000 fine if you throw anything out the window.

02:37:34.300 --> 02:37:36.300
If you get caught.

02:37:36.300 --> 02:37:42.300
Yeah, if you get caught, but it's because the cops are so lazy eating their fucking 12 donuts.

02:37:42.300 --> 02:37:45.820
It doesn't- oh, Krispy Kreme donuts, ooh! The middle!

02:37:45.820 --> 02:37:50.460
Hey, now, now, now, don't be getting, you know, mad at cops for eating donuts.

02:37:50.460 --> 02:37:52.860
They have to have breakfast just like you and me.

02:37:52.860 --> 02:37:58.780
And, goddammit, if they decide to, you know, frequent a donut place, then that's their god-given right.

02:37:58.780 --> 02:38:01.260
Ha ha ha! Yeah...

02:38:01.260 --> 02:38:06.940
Yeah, I'm not gonna- I'm not gonna go with the friggin' donut issue of seeing a cop-

02:38:06.940 --> 02:38:09.900
It's donuts' faults for being so goddamn delicious!

02:38:09.900 --> 02:38:13.900
They have two damn rounds as well.

02:38:13.900 --> 02:38:16.900
I'm not gonna go...

02:38:16.900 --> 02:38:20.900
Let me see, another FD goes to GDR UK for shutting down, of course.

02:38:20.900 --> 02:38:24.900
He's got people trying to spy over MP3s and shit.

02:38:24.900 --> 02:38:32.900
But like I stated earlier, I said, you can always file a calendar to lawsuit for barging in our privacy and shit.

02:38:32.900 --> 02:38:36.900
Always forgiving.

02:38:36.900 --> 02:38:39.300
And if not, really, we'll beat that shit out of him.

02:38:40.300 --> 02:38:41.900
Problem solved.

02:38:42.900 --> 02:38:44.900
Or just kill him if we can't beat him up.

02:38:45.900 --> 02:38:50.900
Uh, yeah, to be continued, because I wanted to keep doing a short show.

02:38:50.900 --> 02:38:54.900
Oh, good, okay, good. Only ten minutes this week, explicit. Appreciate it, I'm kidding.

02:38:54.900 --> 02:38:55.900
Mel B!

02:38:55.900 --> 02:39:00.900
Oh, gosh, uh, after you go to my, uh, workplace over at NAMCO,

02:39:00.900 --> 02:39:04.900
real smooth to have a QA department of about, oh, maybe 60 strong or so,

02:39:04.900 --> 02:39:08.900
and have like six computers for all of us to use.

02:39:08.900 --> 02:39:12.900
Especially more for the bug, like a really big project here.

02:39:12.900 --> 02:39:16.900
And there's just so many crashes that they kind of wonder why there's like ten duplicate bugs

02:39:16.900 --> 02:39:20.900
in like the system. Because no one can go to their own computer,

02:39:20.900 --> 02:39:24.900
look up the PC, see if it's been written already, and just everything is so chaotic.

02:39:24.900 --> 02:39:28.900
So uh yeah, they just need to get their act together and uh, you know, they need to just

02:39:28.900 --> 02:39:32.900
redevelop the place and make it even more Pac-Man-ish. Or you know, at least

02:39:32.900 --> 02:39:37.900
They give us, you know, like Friday, I think Friday, Katamari days, we can like roll our boxes up or something, that'd be pretty nice.

02:39:37.900 --> 02:39:39.900
Do you have Katamari stress balls?

02:39:39.900 --> 02:39:41.900
Maybe.

02:39:43.900 --> 02:39:53.900
Yeah, there's, I'm actually, um, funny enough, one of the people who I know at Namco just granted some Konami work in the marketing division, so I'm gonna try to see if she can do my hookups and stuff.

02:39:53.900 --> 02:39:57.900
And she's Japanese too, so that's a double quad.

02:39:57.900 --> 02:40:03.900
I did find out that, for the LucasArts people, they get thermal nuclear detonator truffles.

02:40:05.900 --> 02:40:12.900
Ah yeah, so yeah, happy to them. Happy to, um, happy to myself for losing my damn keys on Friday night.

02:40:12.900 --> 02:40:18.900
Apparently what happened was, it ended up in Sharp's girl's handbag somehow. I don't know if she had a hand in this.

02:40:18.900 --> 02:40:25.900
I swear to you, I had the bag on your chair. You threw the keys on the chair when you walked in the door and it fell on my bag.

02:40:25.900 --> 02:40:29.900
But you're the responsible one, you should know what you think.

02:40:29.900 --> 02:40:33.900
So yeah, thank you to myself for just losing my keys like I always do.

02:40:33.900 --> 02:40:35.900
Thank God I actually found it.

02:40:35.900 --> 02:40:37.900
But uh, that's about it.

02:40:37.900 --> 02:40:40.900
Life is actually alright otherwise, this week.

02:40:40.900 --> 02:40:42.900
Sharks, girl.

02:40:42.900 --> 02:40:46.900
I don't really have anything, I'm feeling pretty mellow.

02:40:46.900 --> 02:40:49.900
F you to not being happy, or not being angsty.

02:40:49.900 --> 02:40:51.900
F you to being happy and not being angsty.

02:40:51.900 --> 02:40:55.900
Well, F.U. to you for giving me an F.U. to her.

02:40:55.900 --> 02:40:59.900
That's what I was looking for. All right. Nellie, any F.U.s?

02:40:59.900 --> 02:41:04.900
I see you just putting the mic in my face. I don't know if that's really what you're doing.

02:41:04.900 --> 02:41:05.900
I have one to add.

02:41:05.900 --> 02:41:08.900
Ooh, she's getting snippy with me. All right.

02:41:08.900 --> 02:41:10.900
I have one to add, actually.

02:41:10.900 --> 02:41:16.900
An F.U. to LucasArts for ending my friend's assignment so I can't go to the Skywalker Ranch anymore.

02:41:16.900 --> 02:41:20.100
he heard the show and heard that you were gonna fling meatloaf at him

02:41:20.100 --> 02:41:23.780
or whatever it was you were eating that yeah well fuck you George Lucas

02:41:23.780 --> 02:41:27.820
thank you for ruining an entire continuity that I grew up with

02:41:27.820 --> 02:41:33.900
exactly okay Star Wars was my first movie ever

02:41:33.900 --> 02:41:37.940
I was one and my mom drug me screaming to the movie theater

02:41:37.940 --> 02:41:41.140
however I would be quiet whenever Darth Vader was on the screen that would show

02:41:41.140 --> 02:41:43.020
that I was meant to have a life of evil

02:41:43.020 --> 02:41:54.020
Um, but uh, just, screw him, you know? He's, he's messed with my childhood.

02:41:54.020 --> 02:42:01.020
But he did cast Natalie Portman in his movies. I'm gay and I'd hit that.

02:42:01.020 --> 02:42:06.020
And she's one of five people in that movie who have any talent.

02:42:06.020 --> 02:42:08.020
Very true.

02:42:08.020 --> 02:42:12.020
Alright, now now man, that Chewbacca, that's awesome.

02:42:12.020 --> 02:42:14.020
I am looking forward to seeing the Wookie planet though.

02:42:15.020 --> 02:42:18.020
Oh god, they get out of the ship, they're all,

02:42:18.020 --> 02:42:19.020
they're all, what the hell's going on?

02:42:21.020 --> 02:42:22.020
It's just all that.

02:42:24.020 --> 02:42:25.020
Go back, it's too loud.

02:42:29.020 --> 02:42:31.020
It's all it is, it's just so annoying.

Since a lot of my major is now graphic arts and taught in the Mac Lab.

02:47:51.740 --> 02:47:55.740
Alright.

02:47:55.740 --> 02:47:59.740

Thank you guys for participating in tonight's FUs of the Week. Oh no wait! I had one more!

02:48:03.740 --> 02:48:07.740
There was one more that came in over email. I forgot about that because it came from

02:48:07.740 --> 02:48:11.740
Misty. She sent it on her cell phone to my email address.

02:48:11.740 --> 02:48:15.740
FU to my cable modem and CD DVD drives for being out.

02:48:15.740 --> 02:48:19.740

02:48:19.740 --> 02:48:24.100
had another one to add okay just laughable how many people by orientation

02:48:24.100 --> 02:48:27.700
for my Photoshop class was it's an online class was taught the mat was in

02:48:27.700 --> 02:48:31.860
the Mac lab and it was amazing that half the people are saying how do I get on to

02:48:31.860 --> 02:48:37.340
the blackboard because they didn't know where to find Internet Explorer I just

02:48:37.340 --> 02:48:39.340
I laughed.

02:48:39.340 --> 02:48:41.340
Silly PC people.

02:48:41.340 --> 02:48:43.340
I laughed.

02:48:43.340 --> 02:48:48.340
For a very long time. My first computer was one of those old Apple IIe.

02:48:48.340 --> 02:48:50.340
Tall, tall ones.

02:48:50.340 --> 02:48:52.340
It's like, this thing's taller than my head.

02:48:52.340 --> 02:48:54.340
I love Oregon Trail.

02:48:54.340 --> 02:48:55.340
Anyways...

02:48:55.340 --> 02:48:59.340
As long as we're playing Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego on those things.

02:48:59.340 --> 02:49:04.340
As I was going to say before about the retarded people at the Chinese food place,

02:49:04.340 --> 02:49:07.560
there was actually some of those more retarded than the sample lady

02:49:07.560 --> 02:49:11.820
and that was this person i don't even know who she was she wasn't even asian but

02:49:11.820 --> 02:49:14.040

02:49:51.880 --> 02:49:59.960
i'm not a not a kings fan but i won uh floor tickets um to the kings and i honestly i hate

02:49:59.960 --> 02:50:24.960
Where are Laker's Jordan?

02:50:29.960 --> 02:50:34.000
a break, and when we come back, a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge. We have a little bit

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:37.400
of time for Ask Orange Lounge, or you could ask Mel B, Sharks Girl, or Explicit. You could

02:50:37.400 --> 02:50:44.400
ask, maybe you could ask Nellie, that doesn't mean she'll answer you. You can ask, no, never

02:50:45.400 --> 02:50:52.120
mind. Alright, anyway. How much money would it take for you to rape Robin? Alright. Ask

02:50:52.120 --> 02:50:54.720
Orange Lounge when we come back for a little bit, and then we're gonna put the nail in

02:50:54.720 --> 02:50:59.600
the coffin of the show. In this break, we're gonna do a two-song break featuring some requests,

02:50:59.600 --> 02:51:03.240
some song that you guys have been requesting all night long. Here you go. We're gonna start

02:51:03.240 --> 02:51:08.200
it off with a little bit of a ballad. So, get out the lighters and slow dance to this

02:51:08.200 --> 02:51:09.200
one.

02:51:09.200 --> 02:51:26.200
Love you baby, the place is true, just give me a chance to prove I'm leaving you

02:51:26.200 --> 02:51:32.200
Oh baby, I'm never gonna end up to cry

02:51:32.200 --> 02:51:36.200
All I want to do is tell you please

02:51:36.200 --> 02:51:41.200
Love is the magic bird for us to see

02:51:41.200 --> 02:51:47.200
Together we can see the night

02:51:47.200 --> 02:51:51.200
The moon doesn't last that big

02:51:51.200 --> 02:51:55.200
The only earth can know

02:51:55.200 --> 02:51:59.200
The moon doesn't last that big

02:51:59.200 --> 02:52:12.200
When you tell me you love me, you can be my love again

02:52:12.200 --> 02:52:20.200
Come and join me, come and join me

02:52:20.200 --> 02:52:24.200
I will tell you how I feel

02:52:24.200 --> 02:52:27.200
You're in my mind every day

02:52:27.200 --> 02:52:37.200
I will tell you how I feel

02:52:37.200 --> 02:52:40.200
When, when, when you say hello

02:52:40.200 --> 02:52:43.200
Tell me, girl, don't you know

02:52:47.200 --> 02:52:48.200
Now who that is?

02:52:48.200 --> 02:52:49.200
That my baby mama

02:53:49.200 --> 02:53:51.760
If I catch disease, round town sources like a farmer

02:53:51.760 --> 02:53:53.720
You better beware your baby mama

02:53:53.720 --> 02:53:54.460
Who that is?

02:53:54.460 --> 02:53:55.200
My baby momma

02:53:55.200 --> 02:53:56.200
No, who that is?

02:53:56.200 --> 02:53:57.000
My baby momma

02:53:57.000 --> 02:53:58.100
Now who that is?

02:53:58.100 --> 02:53:58.600
Baby momma

02:53:58.600 --> 02:53:59.560
No, who that is?

02:53:59.560 --> 02:54:00.400
My baby momma

02:54:00.400 --> 02:54:01.280
Now who that is?

02:54:01.280 --> 02:54:02.100
My baby momma

02:54:02.100 --> 02:54:02.960
No, who that is?

02:54:02.960 --> 02:54:03.900
My baby momma

02:54:03.900 --> 02:54:04.800
Now who that is?

02:54:04.800 --> 02:54:05.680
My baby momma

02:54:05.680 --> 02:54:06.540
No, who that is?

02:54:06.540 --> 02:54:07.900
My baby momma

02:54:07.900 --> 02:54:32.080
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

02:54:32.080 --> 02:54:41.440
We are back here on Orange Lounge radio, and I was going to do Ask Orange Lounge, but nobody

02:54:41.440 --> 02:54:43.440
submitted a question yet, so I don't know what we're going to do.

02:54:43.440 --> 02:54:44.440
I have a question.

02:54:44.440 --> 02:54:45.440
Well, hold on.

02:54:45.440 --> 02:54:46.440
We've got to do the music.

02:54:46.440 --> 02:54:47.440
Just a minute here.

02:54:47.440 --> 02:54:56.000
Okay, I just put it there in chat, a reminder of how to Ask Orange Lounge, if you would

02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:57.000
like.

02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:58.720
Yeah, ask us a question, bitches.

02:54:58.720 --> 02:55:04.720
Since we don't have any questions yet, what we'll do is we'll allow somebody in the room to ask other folks in the room a question.

02:55:04.720 --> 02:55:07.720
So, let me get the theme music so we can play.

02:55:09.720 --> 02:55:10.720
Here we go.

02:55:17.720 --> 02:55:20.720
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

02:55:20.720 --> 02:55:24.720
What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

02:55:24.720 --> 02:55:28.720
Will you rape me in a bus? Will you rape me in a car? Will you r-

02:55:28.720 --> 02:55:30.720
Fuck it.

02:55:38.720 --> 02:55:41.720
Uhh, Peralta has a question.

02:55:41.720 --> 02:55:44.720
When will you report on Tony Hawk's latest game?

02:55:46.720 --> 02:55:48.720
When monkeys fly out of my ass.

02:55:48.720 --> 02:55:56.640
No, I, well, I like the Tony Hawk games, but they're just, they're too, um, heterosexual for this show.

02:55:56.640 --> 02:55:57.920
I don't know, no, I'm kidding, I don't know.

02:55:58.920 --> 02:56:02.520
When one magically appears on the hard drive of my HD loader.

02:56:03.220 --> 02:56:07.120
When I magically get a chance to play it, I'll let you guys know what I think, I guess.

02:56:07.120 --> 02:56:10.620
I need to play the Punisher, because you can kill people in, like, hundreds of different ways.

02:56:11.620 --> 02:56:16.020
Including, like, taking their jaw, opening it up on a curb, and then smashing their skull down.

02:56:16.020 --> 02:56:19.380
or throwing them through wood chippers or drill presses

02:56:19.380 --> 02:56:23.700
or like many other ways. You can interrogate them over a roof by dangling

02:56:23.700 --> 02:56:25.740
them by their feet and then you can let them go

02:56:25.740 --> 02:56:29.900
and like a bunch of other fun stuff like that. It's like super violent and stuff.

02:56:29.900 --> 02:56:32.940
I'm playing my favorite game already.

02:56:32.940 --> 02:56:37.860
Peralta has a follow-up question. When will monkeys be flying out of Jamie's ass?

02:56:37.860 --> 02:56:41.260
Hopefully never.

02:56:41.260 --> 02:56:49.460
Alright, uh, Zerus says, why do so many people hate on My Baby, insert parent figure here,

02:56:49.460 --> 02:56:51.700
My Baby Mama or My Baby Daddy?

02:56:51.700 --> 02:56:55.500
I don't hate it, I just think we do play that song an awful lot, we're supposed to, you

02:56:55.500 --> 02:56:57.480
know, that's supposed to be a rainy day song.

02:56:57.480 --> 02:57:03.340
We need to do the more politically correct version, you know, uh, My Baby Non-Gender

02:57:03.340 --> 02:57:06.440
Specific Parental Unit.

02:57:06.440 --> 02:57:10.580
My Baby Parent, not...

02:57:10.580 --> 02:57:16.300
I've been reading a lot of those politically correct bedtime stories, those little books.

02:57:16.300 --> 02:57:21.540
And so, I was actually spending the other day trying to filk songs to do them politically

02:57:21.540 --> 02:57:22.540
correct.

02:57:22.540 --> 02:57:23.540
It didn't work.

02:57:23.540 --> 02:57:29.500
Why does my baby have two mamas?

02:57:29.500 --> 02:57:30.500
My baby mamas.

02:57:30.500 --> 02:57:31.500
My baby mamas.

02:57:31.500 --> 02:57:32.500
Alright.

02:57:32.500 --> 02:57:35.860
I'm going to kind of tear through these because suddenly we're getting like eight questions.

02:57:35.860 --> 02:57:36.860
It's crazy.

02:57:36.860 --> 02:57:39.060
So I've got to burn through these because we've only got a little show left here.

02:57:39.060 --> 02:57:43.640
K-Dash wants to know, what is the best way to pick up chicks?

02:57:43.640 --> 02:57:44.640
Show him your wallet.

02:57:44.640 --> 02:57:47.320
Lift them by the shoulders.

02:57:47.320 --> 02:57:48.320
A backhoe.

02:57:48.320 --> 02:57:49.320
Oh.

02:57:49.320 --> 02:57:51.780
Tell him you're a great freestyler.

02:57:51.780 --> 02:57:55.760
When he, well, when he says chicks, he means chicks at DDR attorneys.

02:57:55.760 --> 02:57:57.360
Again, show him your wallet.

02:57:57.360 --> 02:58:01.720
Okay, unless they're competing, they're usually there to watch their boyfriends.

02:58:01.720 --> 02:58:03.560
Is there a barnyard at tournaments?

02:58:03.560 --> 02:58:04.560
Little chicks?

02:58:04.560 --> 02:58:07.320
Cheep, cheep, cheep, ha, ha, ha.

02:58:07.320 --> 02:58:08.320
Boo!

02:58:08.320 --> 02:58:20.320
Do I have any serious advice? You know what? Just go up and say hi. Girls are impressed with a guy with balls. Just go up and say hi.

02:58:20.320 --> 02:58:26.320
Don't say hi repeatedly. If she walks away, don't follow her, because that's stalking.

02:58:26.320 --> 02:58:36.560
Well, if she just doesn't say anything to you, but doesn't move, maybe she didn't hear

02:58:36.560 --> 02:58:37.560
you.

02:58:37.560 --> 02:58:38.560
That could be.

02:58:38.560 --> 02:58:39.800
Or she's pointedly ignoring you.

02:58:39.800 --> 02:58:40.800
Or she's deaf.

02:58:40.800 --> 02:58:41.800
Or dead.

02:58:41.800 --> 02:58:42.800
Or dead.

02:58:42.800 --> 02:58:47.960
A DDR tournament is not a good place to talk to women because it's so fucking loud there.

02:58:47.960 --> 02:58:50.080
Wait until they go outside.

02:58:50.080 --> 02:58:57.680
casually stand there and go, oh hi, I saw you inside. Whip it out! If she walks up to

02:58:57.680 --> 02:59:01.440
you and does the Margaret Cho pick up line, you know you've got it made. Whip it out and

02:59:01.440 --> 02:59:08.120
tell her to suck it, it works every time. You know what line I'm referring to. Stick

02:59:08.120 --> 02:59:16.860
it in! I didn't order this pizza with SUFFAGE! Phoenix says, who are the people on the couch?

02:59:16.860 --> 02:59:23.500
From left to right, Explicit, Mel B, and Sharks Girl.

02:59:23.500 --> 02:59:31.860
Illusion says, what the hell, read any good books lately that aren't of the homoerotic

02:59:31.860 --> 02:59:34.980
variety aka Anne Rice novels?

02:59:34.980 --> 02:59:40.540
Actually it's funny, my bathroom reading right now isn't an Anne Rice novel.

02:59:40.540 --> 02:59:47.540
I'm reading the sequel to Blackwood Farm.

02:59:51.140 --> 02:59:54.380
But it's all from Lestat's point of view, which I think he's absolutely

02:59:54.380 --> 02:59:55.020
hilarious.

02:59:55.020 --> 02:59:58.580
If you want to know why people are busting up laughing, it's because somebody in chat said

02:59:58.580 --> 03:00:01.860
DER attorneys are not a good place to talk to girls because they're

03:00:01.860 --> 03:00:03.020
probably underage.

03:00:03.020 --> 03:00:07.260
Anybody else reading any books you want to share?

03:00:07.260 --> 03:00:09.760
I'm reading a book on how to start your own business.

03:00:09.760 --> 03:00:14.760
Will Wheaton, just a geek. He's an awesome author and he's even funnier live.

03:00:14.760 --> 03:00:15.760
That's hot.

03:00:15.760 --> 03:00:18.760
And I'm actually reading Yao Ming's autobiography right now.

03:00:18.760 --> 03:00:22.760
It's quite, quite interesting I must say, even if you're not a basketball fan.

03:00:24.760 --> 03:00:25.760
Alright.

03:00:25.760 --> 03:00:26.760
Part two.

03:00:26.760 --> 03:00:28.760
Nelly says, Penthouse part two.

03:00:28.760 --> 03:00:31.260
Darkknight says, about Mario DDR.

03:00:31.260 --> 03:00:35.760
If they had no choice but to put a Max 300 style song in it using a Nintendo game song,

03:00:35.760 --> 03:00:42.760
If a tree falls in the forest and no one's around, just admit it.

03:01:05.760 --> 03:01:07.760
Does anyone care?

03:01:07.760 --> 03:01:12.760
If a tree falls in the middle of the forest and nobody's around, nobody's still listening to internet radio.

03:01:12.760 --> 03:01:19.760
I remember that in Family Guy. He's like, yeah, Phil fell down last week and he hasn't stopped talking about it.

03:01:19.760 --> 03:01:28.760
Mikolatov has a question for Loki. Loki, why did you not include Strangers with Candy, the movie, as one of the must-see movies of the year?

03:01:28.760 --> 03:01:36.560
year? Because I had to pick one, and, you know, Sin City was over Strangers with Candy.

03:01:36.560 --> 03:01:40.960
I still want to see Constantine over Sin City. I will make Strangers with Candy my must-see

03:01:40.960 --> 03:01:50.080
movie of the year. There you have it. I still want to see Constantine.

03:01:50.080 --> 03:01:55.040
Legend of Zaku says, out of all the acts from last Tuesday's and Wednesday's American Idol,

03:01:55.040 --> 03:01:59.180
Which do you think was the worst act and why? Did anybody actually watch it?

03:01:59.920 --> 03:02:01.920
Who in here doesn't watch TV?

03:02:02.100 --> 03:02:03.800
My hand is raised.

03:02:03.800 --> 03:02:07.560
I watched it. I was here watching it, remember?

03:02:07.980 --> 03:02:12.380
I think the last chick was cool because she was insane.

03:02:13.180 --> 03:02:16.620
I would say the guy that was related to Toni Braxton, supposedly.

03:02:20.040 --> 03:02:22.520
Who was the worst singer on American Idol on Tuesday or Wednesday?

03:02:22.520 --> 03:02:27.040
Oh, it was the crazy girl who had multiple personalities and she had different voices

03:02:27.040 --> 03:02:31.920
talking to her. That was hilarious. My favorite one, and Rob will agree with me,

03:02:31.920 --> 03:02:37.640
is the one that she's like, Jesus gave me, or God gave me the sound of voice, or like

03:02:37.640 --> 03:02:44.640
the gift of voice, and she's all, God wants me to sing for you, and then Simon's like,

03:02:44.640 --> 03:02:49.760
God does not want you to win this competition.

03:02:49.760 --> 03:02:53.200
SSJ100Matt says, why do only gay guys

03:02:53.200 --> 03:02:56.520
and not hot girls get turned on by guys playing DDR?

03:02:56.520 --> 03:03:00.680
Here's my answer to that. This is Murphy's Law in action because I, being a

03:03:00.680 --> 03:03:01.360
gay man,

03:03:01.360 --> 03:03:06.520
I only attract women playing DDR. So that's just the way life works, buddy.

03:03:06.520 --> 03:03:10.720
Sorry, your non-preferred gender is the one that'll start hitting on you. It's just

03:03:10.720 --> 03:03:13.800
life's funny. Oh, it says

03:03:13.800 --> 03:03:17.120
sharks girl says on the contrary with your girl it's different

03:03:17.120 --> 03:03:20.800
yes if you're a girl and you're playing any video game and you're any good at it

03:03:20.800 --> 03:03:24.760
yeah you get some attention most of the time. Oh my god when I worked for

03:03:24.760 --> 03:03:29.440
um cyber station. Walking around with the Pac-Man shirt

03:03:29.440 --> 03:03:34.880
playing Tekken 3 back in the day. You've got boobs and you're good at games.

03:03:34.880 --> 03:03:40.640
Marry me now. Yeah and I just kicked your ass. When I worked at the shark store wearing a hockey jersey

03:03:40.640 --> 03:03:43.520
spouting facts and knowing more than the guys around

03:03:43.520 --> 03:03:46.600
Oh dear God, it was crazy.

03:03:46.600 --> 03:03:49.960
What would get the people is when I would accurately predict the next

03:03:49.960 --> 03:03:52.920
character to come out because I would follow the Japanese machine

03:03:52.920 --> 03:03:56.360
and actually they did three characters out of order.

03:03:56.360 --> 03:04:02.720
I was playing Star Wars once and I had ten-year-olds boys that looked like they were about ready to propose marriage to me

03:04:02.720 --> 03:04:06.920
because I was so good at it. I would put the cursor where characters were before they were there

03:04:06.920 --> 03:04:10.120
because I had memorized all the patterns.

03:04:10.120 --> 03:04:26.040
I think it's like a line that you hit depending on what type of group because you get the

03:04:26.040 --> 03:04:30.920
worship in some groups and then you get the other way around in other groups is really

03:04:30.920 --> 03:04:32.680
bad in Alabama.

03:04:32.680 --> 03:04:37.760
I was just glad that my boyfriend at the time was as big of a nerd as I was and liked to

03:04:37.760 --> 03:04:43.760
drink just as much as I did.

03:04:43.760 --> 03:04:48.000
Alright we gotta wrap it up so one more question and then we're gonna put the nail in the coffin

03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:49.000
on Ask Orange Lounge.

03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:52.280
I apologize to those of you that were cutting off, we just did the questions in the order

03:04:52.280 --> 03:04:54.120
we received them so you were towards the end.

03:04:54.120 --> 03:04:55.120
Sorry guys.

03:04:55.120 --> 03:05:00.360
DDR Angel wants to know, if MIST is like 20 years old and still very popular, what do

03:05:00.360 --> 03:05:04.320
you think DDR or Bramani in general will be at its 20 year old birthday?

03:05:04.320 --> 03:05:06.580
20 years old.

03:05:06.580 --> 03:05:11.140
I think it'll be the thing that's going to be on VH1's I love the zeroes

03:05:11.140 --> 03:05:13.140
and how Sparks is sitting there going

03:05:13.140 --> 03:05:17.500
those crazy kids were playing that game with the flashing seizure lights and

03:05:17.500 --> 03:05:21.300
and somewhere someone's still going to be raping the bar

03:05:21.300 --> 03:05:23.640
uh... word

03:05:23.640 --> 03:05:27.160
all right i think that uh... definitely sums it up

03:05:27.160 --> 03:05:29.660
dark saccharine? I just had this vision of

03:05:29.660 --> 03:05:32.180
this person twenty years from now

03:05:32.180 --> 03:05:34.020
wait until everybody's gone

03:05:34.020 --> 03:05:35.100
the lights are out

03:05:35.100 --> 03:05:38.220
reached into their closet, pulling out one of those bars.

03:05:38.220 --> 03:05:44.260
This is Orange Lounge Radio Live, this is episode 1048, and you're...

03:05:44.260 --> 03:05:46.820
And I need a job!

03:05:46.820 --> 03:05:47.580
Alright.

03:05:47.580 --> 03:05:51.560
Well, our contract just ended for G5.

03:05:51.560 --> 03:05:54.180
And you know, we've decided that we're going to go off on our own.

03:05:54.180 --> 03:05:55.880
We're going to expand.

03:05:55.880 --> 03:05:59.980
And you know, we just got done buying out 50 companies, and this one we're all

03:05:59.980 --> 03:06:03.620
super successful and elitist we have people to do to you know pretend to be

03:06:03.620 --> 03:06:08.220
us and in the latest ratings book we just got the latest ratings book and

03:06:08.220 --> 03:06:13.860
look orange lounge radio has beaten g4 television in the ratings book and oh it

03:06:13.860 --> 03:06:20.300
looks like the two guys tickling each other channel on live 365 also beat g4

03:06:21.300 --> 03:06:28.620
in fact it looks like g4 came in next to last place and in last place the

03:06:28.620 --> 03:06:36.180
microphone up a donkey's butt station. Hey, I like that station. Don't be dissing the

03:06:36.180 --> 03:06:43.100
microphone up ass ass station. All right. We got to go around and get everybody's final

03:06:43.100 --> 03:06:46.220
thoughts. Sorry to those questions we didn't get to. Explicit, your final thought.

03:06:46.220 --> 03:06:54.580
There's nothing really, so. Mel B., your final thought.

03:06:54.580 --> 03:06:57.580
Oh man, it's good to be back up in here.

03:06:58.580 --> 03:07:01.580
I'm so boring, I don't have one.

03:07:01.580 --> 03:07:03.580
Nellie, your final thought?

03:07:03.580 --> 03:07:06.580
How much money would it take?

03:07:06.580 --> 03:07:09.580
Yeah. Loki, your final thought?

03:07:09.580 --> 03:07:15.580
Do you realize that on the internet, there are actually pictures of people eating babies?

03:07:15.580 --> 03:07:19.580
I kid you not. I have seen pictures of a baby's soup.

03:07:19.580 --> 03:07:34.580
Go to superzooie.com, that's S-U-P-E-R-Z-O-O-I.com. In the left-hand column there will be a picture thing, and click on the one that says Baby Soup, and it actually shows it.

03:07:34.580 --> 03:07:40.580
My final thought is, why is he a co-host? Why? Why, why, why? Jamie?

03:07:40.580 --> 03:07:46.580
My final thought was because he sat on the floor long enough to earn his spot.

03:07:46.580 --> 03:07:50.580

03:09:09.380 --> 03:09:14.380
In dreams he came

03:09:14.380 --> 03:09:18.380
That voice which calls to me

03:09:18.380 --> 03:09:22.380
And speaks my name

03:09:22.380 --> 03:09:26.380
And do I dream again

03:09:26.380 --> 03:09:31.380
For now I find

03:09:31.380 --> 03:09:38.380
The phantom of the opera is there

03:09:38.380 --> 03:09:43.380
Inside my heart

03:09:50.380 --> 03:09:54.380
Sing once again with me

03:09:54.380 --> 03:09:58.380
Our screams duet

03:09:58.380 --> 03:10:02.380
My power over you

03:10:02.380 --> 03:10:06.380
Grows stronger yet

03:10:06.380 --> 03:10:15.380
And though you turn from me to glance behind,

03:10:15.380 --> 03:10:27.380
The time come of the opera is there inside your mind.

03:10:27.380 --> 03:10:42.380
Those who have seen your face draw back in fear

03:10:42.380 --> 03:10:46.380
I am the moth you wear

03:10:46.380 --> 03:10:50.380
It's me they hear

03:10:50.380 --> 03:10:59.380
My spirit and my voice in one combine

03:10:59.380 --> 03:11:06.380
The circle of the operated

03:11:06.380 --> 03:11:15.380
Inside my heart

03:11:15.380 --> 03:11:23.380
Y vez do nando lo mio para

03:11:30.380 --> 03:11:33.380
Hail, my angel of union

03:11:33.380 --> 03:11:40.380
Sing for me!

03:11:40.380 --> 03:11:49.380
Sing for me!

03:11:49.380 --> 03:12:02.380
Sing my angels!

03:12:02.380 --> 03:12:28.260
I have brought you to this seat of sweet music's throne to this kingdom where all must pay

03:12:28.260 --> 03:12:33.260
pay homage to music.

03:12:33.260 --> 03:12:40.260
Music, you have come here

03:12:40.260 --> 03:12:45.260
for one purpose and one alone.

03:12:45.260 --> 03:12:49.260
Since the moment I first had you sing

03:12:49.260 --> 03:12:55.260
I have needed you with me to serve me to sing

03:12:55.260 --> 03:12:59.260
For my music

03:13:01.260 --> 03:13:05.260
My music

03:13:05.260 --> 03:13:35.020
Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.

03:13:35.020 --> 03:13:38.780
Alright guys, that's it for tonight's broadcast to Orange Launch Radio. You know, I totally

03:13:38.780 --> 03:13:43.940
forgot to get into the DDR Freak Idol thing. You know they're doing a DDR Freak Idol competition

03:13:43.940 --> 03:13:45.020
in random chat right now?

03:13:45.020 --> 03:13:46.020
Oh, lovely.

03:13:46.020 --> 03:13:49.700
And I, I, I'm gonna, I'm gonna volunteer us to get involved somehow. I think it might

03:13:49.700 --> 03:13:50.700
be fun.

03:13:50.700 --> 03:13:51.700
What?

03:13:51.700 --> 03:13:56.260
We'll see. Cause the DDR Freak users, you know, they wanna sing. So, we, why not? We've

03:13:56.260 --> 03:14:01.660
got bandwidth. We'll let them sing on our bandwidth maybe. We'll see. We'll see. We'll

03:14:01.660 --> 03:14:04.500
see. It depends what goes on with that contest.

03:14:04.500 --> 03:14:06.340
I'm frightened.

03:14:06.340 --> 03:14:09.580
Why not? I mean, if we let Loki sing on this station...

03:14:09.580 --> 03:14:10.860
But that was comedy.

03:14:10.860 --> 03:14:14.000
You made me do it, and I didn't want to. Anyways, hey,

03:14:14.000 --> 03:14:17.260

03:14:17.260 --> 03:14:19.980

It's called Distraction.

03:14:21.880 --> 03:14:23.140
It's awesome.

03:14:23.140 --> 03:14:27.740
They have, um, you know, basically they torture these people on the game show,

03:14:27.740 --> 03:14:29.600
and they let them win cars,

03:14:29.600 --> 03:14:33.380
and then when they get the car, they have to answer more questions or else they destroy the

03:14:33.380 --> 03:14:43.060
the car it was great now this question is for your windshield and the guy got

03:14:43.060 --> 03:14:48.000
