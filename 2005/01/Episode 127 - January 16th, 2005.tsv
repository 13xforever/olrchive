201976	203397	Or maybe you know me as Rob Roberts.

209400	211842	Also joining me tonight are my lovely co-hosts.

217044	218004	DarkSakura.
219645	220766	Okay, you need to shut up.
221786	223727	DarkSakura, I'm kidding.
224227	229590	I had... I resisted temptation, which everyone's going to hear about later.
229870	231451	But everybody needs to be proud of me.
233172	235013	You're special, and that makes me proud.
236454	237074	And you know what?
237114	237775	So are you.
237935	239796	When are you going to join the Olympic team?
242290	244431	When they make DDR an Olympic sport.
244511	245111	Oh my God.
245191	245951	Oh my God.
245991	247432	When's DDR going to be in the Olympics?
247492	247852	Oh my God.
247892	248272	I don't know.
248332	250153	Jumping on a trampoline is an Olympic sport.
250253	250833	Oh my God.
252573	255114	Hey, don't knock the trampoline, okay?
255134	256735	I don't, but I still think it's funny.
256815	258535	Trampoline is fucking rad.
259116	265918	I was actually like looking into wanting to join like a trampoline class because they were showing it on the news and everything when the Olympics were around.
265938	267859	That's like taking bowling for college credit.
268379	269679	Hey, I did that.
270760	271180	No, I'm kidding.
271240	271440	I didn't.
271460	271640	I didn't.
273641	279143	Alright, also joining us tonight, I actually looked into the bowling class, I'll tell the bowling story later.
280543	285705	Also joining us tonight, say hello to the Tech Massa, with a Massa plan, Loki.
287686	288286	Yeah, hi.
291127	296709	Who has one of those looks of, I don't know what to do tonight, these people are very strange.
297950	298830	Also joining us,
299631	302072	Say hello to our very special guest this evening.
302112	304313	He's also special, just like DarkSakura.
305114	306374	Say hello to Arcadian42.
306514	308655	Is this a non-credible mic?
308995	312557	Or is it a new non-credible mic?
313537	316059	That microphone actually works, but it's kind of quiet.
316499	320941	And you're kind of quiet, so you're really going to have to try tonight.
321041	321461	Listen in!
326055	330479	Well, you don't have to yell out there to listen in, because obviously they're already listening, right?
330499	330639	Yeah.
332600	332900	Alright.
333701	334141	Exactly.
334882	336924	Well, maybe I'll help them to listen a little closer.
338985	339706	Come really close.
340146	340687	Come really close.
340987	341868	Come close to me for a minute.
342408	343329	Come close to the speakers.
344490	344770	Boo!
347792	353977	Uh, yeah, anyway, we got tons of interesting stuff to talk about tonight, or at least in theory we do.
354598	354698	Um...
357078	360339	Just keep thinking this show is good, and then it will be good.
360819	363780	It's going to be interesting because it's somewhat of a slow news week.
363800	365480	We do have a couple big things we want to talk about.
365500	367041	We're going to do that.
367381	371602	All the favorite usual garbage you're used to, we're going to talk about that when we come back from this break.
372322	379344	In this break, we're going to do some music from Dancing Stage Fusion, which is the Europe DDR that just came out a couple months ago.
379364	381805	Actually, it was more than a couple months ago, but end of last year.
382426	387989	But they got some cool licenses in their version of DDR, and you're not going to believe some of the stuff you're going to hear in this break.
388050	389630	It is all in the British DDR.
390091	396935	So enjoy this, and we will be back after this with more of the same old crap you know and love here at Orange Lounge Radio.
397295	400597	Join our chat, www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat.
400917	403979	We'll be back after this, starting it off with DJ Sammy.
404280	406141	No, not Heaven, the other song.
406161	406581	We'll be back.
420325	424208	Thank you for watching!
463854	465055	Thank you for watching!
610359	617123	Fire in the disco Fire in the Taco Bell Fire in the disco
633539	639441	Fire in the gates of hell Don't you wanna know how we keep starting fires?
639601	646223	It's my desire It's my desire It's my desire Don't you wanna know how we keep starting fires?
646283	654385	It's my desire It's my desire It's my desire Danger, danger High voltage When we touch When we kill Danger, danger
663738	673643	High voltage, when we touch, when we kiss, when we touch Danger, danger, high voltage, when we touch, when we kiss Danger, danger, high voltage, when we touch, when we kiss
701854	705161	Tell me, is life just a playground?
706303	710973	Think you're the real deal, honey And someone will always look out for you
796175	804804	Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.
810650	816196	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and in that break you heard some songs from Dancing Stage Fusion.
816216	818318	To give you an idea, if you didn't know what some of those songs were...
818778	828950	DJ Sammy with Sunlight, Kylie Minogue coming to my world, Electric Six with Danger High Voltage, also known as the Taco Bell song, and Basement Jacks, Good Luck.
829470	830992	All of those are songs that are really cool.
831172	833455	We played that song in my spin class.
834797	836939	Because I introduced my spin teacher to Good Luck.
837480	839282	Wasn't that a former cage match pick of yours, too?
839682	839982	It was.
840102	842344	And it was also in the Queer Eye soundtrack.
842544	843825	And look, it ended up in DDR.
844185	846586	And Kylie Minogue... I am so damn talented!
847007	850088	Kylie Minogue, coming to my world, was once in the Orange Lounge Cage Match.
850649	852150	Ended up in DDR.
852230	852730	Look at that.
853851	856892	So people don't think we know what we're talking about, but, you know, shit.
857213	861275	Just cross your fingers that Girls by Prodigy will not end up in DDR.
864517	864917	It will.
866018	866318	Alright.
867219	867499	Anyway...
868435	869216	and David Hasselhoff
891975	895677	We did get some good stuff, but I would have rather had that.
896057	902561	And it kind of sucks because it's really hard to import the Europe DDR because you have to get one of those converters for your TV as well.
902921	904301	It's easy to import Japanese.
904321	908964	You just get a Japanese PlayStation 2, get the Japanese game, and the TVs are the same format.
909424	912446	But if you want to do the Europe, the TVs are in a different format.
913246	915247	The screens are actually a different resolution over there.
916187	919089	Stupid Europe and their base 10 measurement systems.
921326	924609	Stupid metric system and everything being easy math.
924769	926451	Like the rest of the world uses.
926571	927072	Hello?
928753	929434	I know, I know.
930435	930755	Alright.
931516	933578	I'm looking at the comments in our chat room.
933778	935640	www.orangenautoradio.com, click on chat.
936100	941646	Jaded2005 says, Girls would probably end up in DDR as Konami's way to shaft us again.
944560	945040	I would cry.
945361	950204	I'm going to write a letter to Jason Enos myself and request that girls be put in the next DDR.
952166	954207	As much as that song bugs me, I just think that would be funny.
955228	957690	A very strange video.
958010	961132	Prodigy was famous for that one video, the Smack My Bitch Up video.
961212	961933	Is it just as good?
962313	964595	Because the Smack My Bitch Up video was just, wow.
965115	973902	Well, this obviously doesn't help for the people at home, but I have... It was an edited version of the video for the first remix of Girls I Submitted to the Cage Match.
975005	976166	Um... It's a really bad one.
977166	977606	Yeah, whatever.
977686	988770	Okay, anyways, um... So, just to give you an idea, I mean, this obviously is not going through to listeners, but it's just really very strange.
988810	995673	They've got, like, some person that looks like a kid with, like, some army costume and a floating head, giant lips talking.
996333	998934	They've got, like, the Rocky Horror lips mixed with Max Headroom.
999414	1003836	They do, like, the Rocky Horror lips with White Wolf RPGs.
1004272	1010094	And then it just gets even stranger with this thing moving around and giant lips watching it.
1011094	1015715	Okay, well, the chatroom can't see it, but where could they maybe get a copy of it?
1015775	1017016	I mean, you got this from somewhere, right?
1018276	1022757	I believe this was on the... Oh, God, who was that?
1024558	1025878	It was the group that remixed it.
1029539	1030159	Let me see here.
1030320	1031720	I believe it was...
1032694	1034616	The fake ID's website.
1035636	1036797	Fake ID is the band name.
1037398	1040420	And there's a link in their download section to the video.
1041881	1046225	Alright, so if you want to check out random 80's flashback to a cruddy song, enjoy.
1048427	1049828	You know, shut up.
1051109	1052250	Alright, I'll change the topic.
1052530	1053891	Or else I'll put in another version.
1054051	1055012	I've got two more.
1055432	1056813	They will go in the cage match.
1058415	1061137	That's going to be Loki's threat all night long.
1061716	1064358	Don't piss me off or I swear to God I'll do it again.
1065358	1065939	I dare you.
1065999	1066940	I double dog dare you.
1066960	1068521	The chat room's very divided there.
1068881	1070162	I triple dog dare you.
1070222	1071362	The chat room's very divided.
1071422	1072563	Some are yelling at you to do it.
1072643	1075065	I quadruple two-headed dog dare you.
1077787	1078047	All right.
1078307	1082710	We're going to get into How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, but we did have a newcomer join us during the break there.
1083190	1086753	Not much of a newcomer because she's been at this show a gazillion million times.
1086773	1087693	Say hello to DDR Angel.
1088334	1088534	Hello.
1088554	1088674	Hello.
1089830	1091511	and why are you tardy, ma'am?
1092851	1094672	Uh, traffic and stuff.
1095312	1096132	That's no excuse.
1096152	1097092	You should have left earlier.
1097132	1098673	I'm going to mark that down as tardy.
1099173	1099573	FIRED!
1100593	1101194	I am not.
1101654	1102734	You lie so bad.
1104214	1105815	She just, she knows she can get away with it.
1106075	1107796	Besides, I brought you something.
1107876	1110096	Ooh, she brought me, okay, gifts make it better.
1110116	1110496	What'd you bring me?
1110516	1110897	What'd you bring me?
1110917	1111837	What'd you bring me?
1114738	1117078	All is forgiven because I got free stuff.
1117218	1117879	Ooh, soda.
1118079	1118659	Ooh, what is this?
1119778	1121719	Diet Cherry Vanilla Dr. Pepper?
1122539	1122779	Ew!
1123279	1124259	I've never heard of this.
1124759	1124940	Ew!
1125160	1125840	It's gross.
1126980	1127640	It sounds interesting.
1127680	1128841	Well, I will be the judge of that.
1128861	1129301	It is foul.
1129781	1131101	I will be the judge of that, Ms.
1131141	1131401	Thing.
1131622	1132742	I had it in Alabama.
1134162	1136923	Oh, okay.
1137043	1138223	I had this in November.
1138724	1143985	When I went to Alabama, I was like, oh, that looks neat and interesting, and the commercials are on the radio all the goddamn time.
1144345	1145226	I think I'll try one.
1145526	1146526	I had three sips of it.
1149249	1150730	I gave the rest of it to a homeless person.
1153412	1154052	He threw it away.
1156534	1157154	Wait a minute.
1157574	1159776	You gave your soda to a homeless person?
1159796	1160216	How does that work?
1160236	1161257	Well, I don't know if he was a homeless person.
1161277	1162137	He looked like a beach bum.
1162798	1163738	He was out Pensacola.
1165399	1166200	Loki, comment.
1168361	1171823	Yeah, because, you know, I always like taking shitty soda and adding shit to it.
1172103	1176106	You know, this soda would be just all that better if I put vanilla and cherry in it.
1177242	1179004	I don't like Dr. Pepper anyway, so... They've had this...
1189184	1190925	at least in the southeast for a while now.
1191165	1195467	I'm going to go over to the webcam and sample the Diet Cherry Vanilla Dr. Pepper.
1195808	1196648	I'll have the barf bag ready.
1196668	1198949	Webcam's over at www.warnersonsradio.com.
1199450	1206934	In the meantime, since I can't expect everybody to be looking at the webcam, we'll start off our show as we always do, playing a little bit of How was your week?
1206974	1207734	How was your day?
1208315	1211997	And Jamie's going to start us off, as always, by letting us know, How was your week?
1212437	1212877	How was your day?
1213557	1218040	My week was sick, as in I've had this cough that hasn't wanted to go away.
1222497	1225438	and Holiday Spice Pasty is just as nasty.
1228639	1236621	Anyway, it was my last week over in the student loan industry.
1237101	1238121	Thank God!
1238642	1242503	And I swear the VP was kissing my ass the whole time trying to get me to stay.
1243183	1245123	And my boss took me out to eat.
1245863	1246704	And oh, this is funny.
1247864	1248284	What do you think?
1251856	1257819	I didn't take a very big sip because the chat room just told us that the webcam isn't up still, so we're going to turn it on right now, and I'll take another sip.
1261401	1268724	Anyway, it was kind of a really messed up, sad week.
1268784	1270084	It was a very frustrating week.
1271585	1277188	And I just didn't have the energy to do much of anything, although I tried step aerobics and I didn't care for it.
1278588	1279789	That was my new thing that I did.
1280789	1285973	Um, although Friday I took the day off and, uh, oh, here we go.
1286913	1289796	But, uh, Friday I took the day off and went to the Skywalker Ranch.
1290136	1298642	Um, I have a friend that works for LucasArts and she got us into the Skywalker Ranch and so we were gonna go, uh-oh, I'll wait, I have to see this.
1299302	1299943	Take your drink.
1300943	1301444	Suffer!
1301464	1305647	Uh-oh.
1313058	1318761	It really just tastes like regular Dr. Pepper to me with like a funny flavor to it.
1318941	1320042	I can't explain it.
1320122	1321162	It's not cherry or vanilla.
1321202	1323143	It's just hilarity.
1323383	1326325	It's Dr. Pepper flavored with hilarity.
1327906	1336690	And the aftertaste is... Mmm, Dr. Pepper vaginal juice mix.
1338171	1340092	Anyway, I went to the Skywalker Ranch.
1340112	1340312	Disgusting.
1341195	1342977	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1363169	1367132	Speaking of altering Star Wars, we're sitting there at our table eating.
1367713	1375079	All of a sudden, guess who walks by behind us but George Lucas himself and the business associate discussing things.
1375099	1376960	I hope you flick your mashed potatoes at him.
1377200	1377961	I didn't eat mashed potatoes.
1378762	1382805	I really wanted to flick my meatloaf at him but the meatloaf was really good and I didn't want to ruin it.
1383686	1384847	You might have gotten kicked out too.
1385167	1385407	Yeah.
1385587	1386388	But it would have been worth it.
1386708	1389931	But we next went and raided the employee store.
1390811	1392653	So I actually have an episode 3 hoodie.
1393444	1399108	Just because I really wanted a hoodie, and I figured Episode 3 hoodie, nobody else has one unless they work there, so hey, cool.
1399188	1400169	Oh, you're special.
1400469	1402370	Well, I just figured it was an opportunity.
1402530	1405492	Well, I know you don't like to go on cam, but can we model your hoodie?
1406213	1406953	Yeah, I suppose.
1407634	1408915	I'll model your hoodie.
1409015	1410135	Okay, model my hoodie.
1411516	1416900	I also got an ILM shirt, and on the back it says Visual Arts Crew, which I thought was really nifty.
1419041	1420322	Better watch out, it smells like me.
1420342	1422704	It smells like camo, which is what I'm really wearing.
1427165	1427905	It's upside down, Rob.
1429006	1429546	And backwards.
1430607	1432268	Oh, you're just infinitely amusing.
1436751	1438972	Hold the hood back and hold it out by the shoulders.
1438992	1439372	There you go.
1441093	1442114	See, I'm cool.
1443895	1450559	Anyway, we also, I got a really nice leather business folder for Dan.
1451226	1469141	and we actually got everything, all this expensive shit at half price because one of our friends, because our friend was of course with us and I also had a latte made by a $10,000 latte machine and it was like a really damn good latte too it was like professional and shit, it was really yummy
1471045	1476426	and so we sat in this sort of lounge area enjoying our latte.
1476446	1479327	They had a bunch of old Star Wars and Indiana Jones toys in there.
1479347	1480007	Cool.
1480047	1481987	Because we went by the marketing director's office.
1482908	1484348	The licensing director, that was it.
1485568	1488869	I just want to clarify, the food was better than episode one?
1489129	1490509	Yes, incredibly.
1490649	1491670	The food was excellent.
1491990	1492970	The movie was not.
1493630	1497991	We sort of were too stunned to go mob the man and say...
1498345	1501288	Hey, Jorge, what was wrong with your head?
1504110	1509676	And it was funny, we were talking to a couple of the receptionists there, just, you know, seeing who all they've met and everything.
1509696	1511517	It's like, oh, a George sighting!
1512658	1513799	So it was kind of funny.
1514120	1519825	Nothing beats watching a really shitty Star Wars movie that's been bootlegged with really shitty subtitles.
1520486	1523989	Like, for instance, you know, lines like, You'll be the desert of me.
1524562	1552963	Or Sup, Yoda That's funny Sup, Yoda But, you know, after that we took a trip to Network Video Because our friend still had to work And at Network Video we made some purchases We bought Saturn AV cables We bought Street Fighter Alpha for the US Saturn Because we didn't have it, believe it or not I have to ask
1553823	1556465	How many times do you actually play these games after you buy them?
1557206	1557806	I play them.
1558106	1559007	Okay.
1559127	1561389	Actually, I also bought a Japanese game for the GameCube.
1562330	1562830	Oh, what game?
1563171	1566053	Dobutsu no Mori, which was Animal Crossing in the U.S.
1566593	1566733	Oh!
1566914	1571858	And the whole reason I was basically peeing in my pants the whole time watching this game was because...
1574483	1576025	I thought, because you know in the U.S.
1576245	1580091	one, it says each individual letter when they're talking.
1580772	1585438	But people usually go through it, and I was like, okay, well, you can't really understand the letters.
1586480	1586600	And...
1588584	1592007	On some movie files, I had people playing the Japanese version.
1592027	1596792	I thought they were just speeding through it because they were saying it all so fast, but I could tell that they were saying each of the kana.
1597432	1604419	So I thought, well, maybe if I let it go slow, I'll hear what they're saying and can use it as practice for, you know, my comprehension.
1604659	1608883	Because that was the whole reason I won it, is because all of the text in the game is in hiragana.
1609784	1612226	So, yeah, I don't have to worry about reading any kanji because, like,
1612626	1614748	One of the 30 kanji I know is in the title.
1627850	1629531	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1658813	1660554	Go find a homeless person and give them a Nintendo 64.
1660754	1662795	The fuck am I going to do with this?
1669633	1673495	I put it in, and to my disappointment, they spoke just as fast as it did in the thing.
1673536	1677558	But it's actually neat because I like how you enter your text.
1678178	1682721	Instead of having to go to that little screen where you choose your letters, instead you use your analog pad.
1682981	1691326	Because the quote alphabet is done in a series of, like, you have five in each group.
1691746	1695508	Like, I, U, A, O, Ma, Mi, Mu, Me, Mo, Sa, Shi, Tu, Te, To, like that.
1696244	1721876	A, I, U, Me, Mo But the way that you do is you pick each of the first ones in the group The A sound like you could pick the A group or Ma group or Sa group, like that And then you choose that on your analog pad And then it pulls up all of the ones in that one So you choose everything with your analog pad It's very, very smart Very cool It wouldn't work for English, of course, which is probably why they changed it But it makes it a lot easier
1722481	1724823	I'm so looking forward to Animal Crossing on the DS, though.
1724983	1727204	Oh, so am I. So am I. Happy thoughts.
1728565	1732688	But also, I'm looking forward to actually being able to play Zelda and Mario without having a code.
1734389	1736350	Because they were just, you could dig them up in the dirt.
1737851	1741414	But, um, I figured it'll help me with my learning.
1742114	1748498	You know, and I did a pretty decent job reading it through, uh, through, uh, with, uh, what was his face?
1748899	1750200	I can't believe I forgot his name.
1750940	1751881	But, um, the dog.
1751901	1752101	Yeah.
1753840	1755420	Yeah, KK.
1756521	1757861	Oh, Tom Nook?
1758341	1759781	No, I'm trying to remember his actual name.
1760102	1760502	Toto KK.
1760562	1761382	Oh, okay.
1761402	1761622	That's it.
1761662	1763542	Toto KK.
1764763	1766443	But I had a pretty good time with that.
1766483	1773905	And then yesterday, I went over to Iguana Girls House, and we played lots of 8-style and lots of Poppin' 9.
1774805	1777426	I have to thank Raichan for selling me her Poppin' 9.
1778166	1778566	And, uh...
1779481	1784664	and Navi for selling me his controller, which still works beautifully, I might add.
1784784	1784964	Good.
1785384	1790827	And my five-year-old 2DX controller still functions as perfectly as when I opened the box.
1790847	1791688	You lucky bitch.
1792308	1794069	Well, we actually... Mine is broke as hell.
1794089	1795610	We've only cleaned it out twice.
1796430	1798331	I tried to clean mine out like five times and still it was on.
1798351	1801313	But this last time we actually took it out and actually cleaned the circuit board.
1802494	1804675	And it was, it's almost flawless now.
1804695	1805835	I mean, you can tell it's kind of old.
1806376	1807777	But we played lots of 8th style.
1807817	1808437	It was pretty fun.
1809076	1813960	and then we had Musical Night where we watched Little Shop of Horrors and Chicago.
1814440	1815561	Didn't you guys go see Phantom?
1815821	1816302	No, we didn't.
1816782	1818103	But I'm going to go see it tomorrow with Tia.
1818303	1819564	Okay.
1820405	1822386	But I have to say this about Chicago.
1822447	1825509	This is the first movie I really liked that I hated all the characters in.
1826670	1829312	I hate every single damn character in that movie.
1829872	1831494	I hated the blonde whoever.
1831934	1832695	Renee Zellweger?
1832775	1835897	Yes, and I hated Catherine Zeta-Jones' character a whole lot.
1836277	1836858	I liked the...
1839491	1843233	The ballerina girl who got, you know... Spoilers.
1843754	1844694	I'm not going to spoil.
1844794	1847696	Okay, but... The one that didn't speak English.
1848776	1849457	She was nice.
1849677	1854220	You, of all people, must have loved that song where they talked about killing all their boyfriends.
1854260	1857121	Oh yeah, that was my favorite.
1858662	1861584	And I also liked the whole scene with the courtroom with the tap dance.
1863042	1865544	The thing is that I really love the cinematography in the movie.
1865884	1869866	I like how they integrated all the song numbers with the reality.
1871046	1872887	And I love the music.
1872987	1873767	I love the songs.
1873807	1874768	Everybody sang well.
1875108	1877249	But I hated every single last character.
1877289	1880330	And the character I hated the most was the woman's husband.
1881631	1881911	Oh, yeah.
1882270	1883310	I didn't feel sorry for him at all.
1883550	1884291	Guy asked for it.
1884951	1890932	He was a big, stupid sap the whole damn time, and if he had any balls to him, he would have divorced her that moment.
1891172	1892353	He wouldn't have done anything.
1892393	1893933	He would have said, excuse me, bitch.
1897294	1897634	Okay.
1897814	1899155	You're quite feisty tonight.
1899195	1899575	I'm enjoying this.
1899595	1900695	I am in a mood.
1900955	1901615	I'm enjoying this.
1901755	1902996	But I'm going to go see Phantom of the Mars.
1903016	1903336	I'm happy.
1903536	1907537	I'll tell you my favorite character in the whole movie, and this is totally the gay in me talking, but I don't care.
1909355	1912798	When you're good to mama, mama's good to you.
1912838	1915800	That was actually, I have to say, that's my second favorite song in it.
1916241	1917822	She's a really nice voice.
1917982	1921065	I would have never expected Queen Latifah to be in that role, but she's awesome.
1921085	1927570	I heard her sing at the Oscars, because they televised that, and that's actually the only part of the Oscars I watched that year, was just to hear her sing.
1927590	1928451	She rocks.
1928471	1930872	Because she filled in for, what's her name, because she was pregnant.
1931633	1932854	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.
1933254	1933835	She did very good.
1933875	1936437	I never realized just, like, what a great voice Queen Latifah has.
1937958	1938819	She's a very good voice.
1939656	1948800	But one thing, though, that I really have to say this, though, costuming-wise, is that they should not have put Renee Zelliger in some of those clothes because she just doesn't have the figure for it.
1949601	1951161	You know, I remember originally... She's built like a boy.
1951461	1952662	Madonna was supposed to be in that movie.
1952682	1953723	That would have been cool.
1953743	1954663	That would have been interesting.
1955483	1956844	She would have been really good in that role, too.
1957164	1957864	That would have been wrong.
1957924	1960125	Well, actually, she was supposed to be the Catherine Zeta-Jones one.
1960326	1960806	Oh, really?
1961526	1961706	Huh.
1961786	1962026	Yeah.
1963047	1963327	I don't know.
1963712	1965412	Who cares?
1965452	1968393	You guys are here to listen about video games and here we are talking musicals.
1969393	1972774	The thing is, believe it or not, we did not watch Rocky.
1972794	1974655	Really?
1974675	1976335	We had a musical night and didn't watch Rocky.
1979396	1980416	That was my week.
1980896	1984557	Yeah, I have issues with certain things.
1985517	1987477	I didn't like anybody in that damn movie.
1988278	1988738	Not a one.
1989378	1989758	Not a one.
1991161	1991681	That's all right.
1991902	1992422	Okay, I'm done.
1992582	1992982	You're done?
1993723	1994023	All right.
1994684	1999207	I was actually going to see, I thought I actually had the When You're Good to Mama song from Chicago.
1999227	2000968	I was going to play a little clip, but I can't find it, so.
2002129	2004271	Our listeners are spared from musical night.
2004291	2005071	That would be great.
2005091	2005892	We should have musical night.
2006392	2009495	Dude, do you have the Husband Killing song?
2009975	2010856	I had it somewhere.
2010876	2011736	I don't know where it is, though.
2011756	2011997	Oh, no.
2012037	2014118	We should play that during the break.
2014518	2017861	Maybe during the afterbirth, even though we don't really have an afterbirth anymore, but.
2018536	2019496	We need to play that.
2019536	2020616	I'll see what I can find.
2020836	2021317	You know what?
2021397	2024337	I will find it for you and you can use it as a fortune cookie next week, maybe.
2024717	2024957	Okay.
2025057	2025818	There you go.
2025858	2028918	I want to go find the... Okay, I'm going to download it when I get home.
2028938	2030218	I'm going to find the soundtrack and play Tuesday.
2030238	2031059	Oh, there you go.
2031139	2031419	I'll play it.
2031439	2032879	That's what I look forward to.
2032899	2033619	I'll pump up the volume.
2033919	2035600	You want to plug Pump Up the Volume real fast, Jamie?
2035620	2037340	Hey, Pump Up the Volume is Tuesday.
2037400	2038340	Tune the hell in.
2039240	2040661	At six... I'm sorry.
2040921	2044421	It's supposed to be at seven o'clock for the pre-show, but I usually start around 645.
2044701	2046522	Because I'm bored.
2047162	2047422	All right.
2048941	2055745	Let's move on and as much as it pains me to move away from musicals, we're going to talk to Loki for a minute and ask Loki, how was your week?
2055785	2056326	How was your day?
2059468	2060368	My week was pretty good.
2060388	2064451	I got the rest of my stuff in from my computer thing.
2065372	2074638	I haven't really gotten to work much on that because I spent most of the day, well, part of the day yesterday looking for my drill bit set and I finally found it on top of the cabinet.
2075259	2075519	So...
2076311	2076752	Thanks for watching!
2092701	2093042	What else?
2093102	2096885	I went out to dinner last night to Tahoe Joe's.
2096925	2099468	And they're okay, but their mashed potatoes taste like shit.
2100609	2102451	Other than that, their food was decent.
2102471	2108456	I don't really like going back there because, I don't know, there was a lot of stuff I didn't like about them.
2109257	2109898	But whatever.
2110118	2113962	It was fun to try because I had a gift certificate, so, you know, free dinner.
2116263	2118184	Thanks for watching and see you next time!
2135982	2154592	Yeah, I don't remember if I mentioned this last week, because I can't remember exactly when in the timeline this took place, but apparently the store chain that I do customer service for, Movie Gallery, purchased Hollywood Video, in which case they're probably going to go to self-distribution, which I don't see how that's possible, considering they're retarded.
2155532	2157953	So that means I might be out of a job anyway.
2159074	2162736	But, no, they just relocate me to some customer service job.
2163556	2163997	No thanks.
2164057	2164637	Basically...
2165791	2166652	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2181011	2181812	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2203008	2215923	So, basically, after spending seven straight hours title matching, which I might add to you is very draining and very tedious, I finally got done, and so I submitted the stuff off to them, and, you know, they were happy.
2215943	2223531	They were like, well, we wouldn't have had you do it if, you know, we knew it was going to take that long or, you know, it was going to be that much work, so, yay.
2223872	2224052	But...
2224711	2233593	Because I was worn out or whatever, I somehow forgot to delete the order, so one of each of these 3,000 titles or whatever came into one of our branches.
2234993	2251537	I think that mistake cost the company, well, right now it's costing them about, I don't know, a couple, I don't know, tens of thousands of dollars, which in the grand scheme of things isn't that much, considering they can turn around and return all this stuff, but they're just making a big deal about it right now.
2252392	2254453	I don't know why, but, you know, whatever.
2254693	2257294	So, that's that.
2257394	2258934	And so I gotta deal with that on Monday.
2259274	2259834	Fun, fun.
2260194	2262115	And, um, yeah.
2262335	2263556	So that was pretty much my week.
2264036	2265236	Um, kinda sucked.
2265856	2267177	But, uh, yeah.
2267757	2274959	So, I gotta be looking for a new job anyways because, uh, you know, this one isn't doing a very good job paying the bills.
2275679	2276380	Need more money.
2277520	2279180	And besides, they're not moving me anywhere, so.
2280041	2280741	Yep, need out.
2282128	2283468	So that's pretty much all that happened.
2284209	2285509	Oh, and that and a lot of Final Fantasy.
2287749	2287849	Oh.
2289050	2291710	I did have one thing to say since you said the evil addict word.
2291931	2292151	Yes.
2294191	2298672	Because the copies literally fell onto my lap.
2300073	2302313	No, this was fate saying something.
2303033	2308895	I was doing some cleaning out of some drawers and onto my lap fell a series of discs in a box.
2310330	2313331	Right next to them is a book that has certain key codes in it.
2314431	2317612	And right next to that was a little notepad with all my passwords on it.
2318912	2321233	So I'm going to be rejoining the stupid world.
2322333	2322453	Of?
2323414	2324514	Stupid Addict Game.
2325394	2327815	You mean you're going to sign up for Final Fantasy XI?
2328015	2329195	Because I'm canceling AOL.
2329895	2330175	Addict!
2330636	2331616	No, not really.
2333796	2339618	It's for multiple purposes for me, and that and the fact that gravity has turned into a bunch of retards.
2340100	2342801	So I'm actually going to quit Final Fantasy XI when Ragnarok 2 comes out.
2343502	2345263	They turned into?
2345963	2347204	Meaning they weren't before?
2347524	2349965	They got increasingly stupid.
2350305	2358229	Because I was thinking about rejoining RO and World of Warcraft and when they filled up their servers in two weeks I just decided no.
2358429	2363212	You may remember back to when LankyStyle and I used to impersonate the Gravity personnel.
2363732	2365433	You want to talk bad about company?
2365673	2366634	We ban you!
2366894	2368375	You want to have bots on our server?
2368655	2369035	Ban!
2370003	2370343	Yeah.
2371264	2374045	So, you know, why not?
2374445	2375745	And I have people to play with.
2376506	2386230	And I figured I'm probably going to be so bombarded with school and everything else, it's going to be a good distraction.
2387550	2394753	The nice thing is that Angel plays on Final Fantasy XI now, and I love Angel because she is such our bitch.
2395453	2396694	And she will be your bitch, too.
2398187	2399028	Uh, Thief.
2427642	2428323	Thank you for watching!
2440073	2443255	I guess Warrior to start off with because that'll be the easiest.
2443275	2444116	You just hit shit.
2444716	2445457	That's pretty much it.
2446157	2447418	Can't get any easier than that.
2447438	2448880	I want Thief stuff to get money.
2449200	2454384	Well, I was just thinking that, you know, I just thought, ah, Ninja stuff is hella expensive.
2454404	2456646	Then I thought, wait a minute, Ranger's the most expensive in the game.
2456666	2460168	Maybe there's not any merchant class like there is in Ragnarok because merchants are owned.
2460909	2461890	You just go outside and...
2462762	2463062	Petal.
2463482	2469286	Well, maybe they'll add something to Final Fantasy XI in the future, but I don't want to turn this into Final Fantasy XI chat.
2469446	2471727	I figured that I would mention the decision, so.
2472647	2475149	Should I bring up that Gravity thing, since she kind of mentioned it?
2475769	2476129	Sure.
2477390	2483793	Gravity came out with a new game that has, like, the same sound effects as Ragnarok, which was kind of weird.
2484174	2485234	It's called Rose.
2485975	2487055	I don't know if you've heard about it, Jamie.
2487095	2489957	Yes, I have, and I've actually signed up for an account on Rose Online.
2489977	2492078	Yeah, I've got one as well, so we can play there, too.
2492098	2492298	Haha.
2494349	2495389	Rosarock Online.
2497550	2499511	There, yes, we're going to just change the name of this.
2499531	2501231	Dude, you can be a pirate on an airship.
2502172	2503332	How rad is that?
2504672	2506013	I forgot what it stands for, though.
2506853	2507954	My brain drew a blank.
2507974	2510494	Something of seven events.
2510975	2514016	If you want to be pirates, you better follow rules, or we ban you.
2514096	2515176	We make you walk plank.
2515596	2517917	I think it's Road of Seven Events or something.
2519384	2520504	What exactly do you do in this game?
2520824	2523645	It's like Ragnarok, but it's 3D.
2523865	2525845	Yeah, 3D and, yeah, there you go.
2526626	2529246	It's just like Ragnarok, but it's more 3D and it's cool and, yeah.
2531847	2533007	So, yeah, more game stuff.
2535408	2540049	Now, this time when you sign up, you're going to be a good girl and go with Sandoria as opposed to Bastok, right?
2540289	2540929	I suppose.
2541889	2544950	I learned my way around Bastok pretty damn well because I kept dying.
2545130	2546430	Or as we call it, Lastok.
2548295	2549676	Maybe I'll go to Winters.
2551197	2554160	Winters, the only problem with Winters is that you get lost there very easily.
2554480	2557002	Oh my god, it went back to Final Fantasy XI chat.
2557123	2559425	Bad host, bad, bad, bad.
2559445	2560325	So how was your week, Rob?
2561847	2563048	Well, I'm so glad you asked, Jamie.
2564349	2565110	Were you done, Loki?
2565150	2565490	I'm sorry.
2568653	2570935	Yeah, well, Winters sucks because it's so big.
2571395	2572877	Stop it now, stop now.
2577188	2582131	My week and my day were pretty good, I guess I also played a lot of that
2583622	2590165	And I'm looking forward to tonight because I'm actually going to be going out tonight and I'm going to the Goth Club.
2590645	2594627	You know, we've joked about this on the show a few weeks ago before, you know, last time I went.
2595147	2598228	Usually when a three-day weekend comes up, Rob does one of two things.
2598349	2601350	Either Rob drinks on the show or Rob goes to the Goth Club.
2601390	2606232	So tonight I opted for Goth Club because Gwana Girl is going to meet me out there because she hasn't been to the Goth Club for a while.
2606292	2611314	So we're going to go and as you can see, I'm dressed in all black right now and I'll go model on the cam again in a minute.
2612939	2627780	and um and uh we're just gonna go and we're gonna look sit in the corner and look tragic you're gonna goth serve we're totally gonna goth serve people it'll be great um and um
2628527	2629187	Happy Handbag Sylvia Drive
2656363	2656523	Ranma 1.5
2677782	2692909	and I got to see the first couple episodes and it's one of those animes I actually enjoy I think it's so cute, it makes me laugh and we were going to play Metroid Prime 2 Echoes because I'm really curious to check out that game but I don't know, we ran out of time we ended up watching A Mighty Wind instead
2694281	2694741	Go figure.
2695981	2703883	And then, well, Christopher made us watch episodes of Upright Citizens Brigade, which was this old show that was on Comedy Central a couple years ago, like five, six years ago.
2704383	2706023	It was actually kind of funny.
2706123	2707423	Like, some of it was really funny.
2707743	2709964	The concept, I really liked the concept.
2710524	2714304	Some of the humor was a little, like it was hit and miss, but I thought the concept was great.
2714445	2715485	And the girl in that show rocks.
2716205	2716425	Anyway.
2717745	2719205	I guess that's pretty much it for my week and my day.
2719325	2721646	I didn't do anything that exciting, game-wise.
2722146	2722946	Except that one game.
2723180	2727381	Actually, speaking of anime, a friend of mine got me onto an anime lately.
2727401	2729102	I've been watching Fruits Basket.
2729222	2729762	It's cute.
2730062	2730982	I didn't think I'd like it.
2732723	2733623	Ah, you meanie!
2734083	2735183	I would have bought it from you.
2737924	2744386	I'm sure they have it cheap, not... That's okay, because I have rips of the DVDs.
2744826	2746286	I mean, pictures of them.
2746586	2748947	Tell us, for those of us that are not as into anime...
2749676	2750616	I don't want to spoil it.
2750636	2751356	It's cute.
2751396	2754117	What's kind of the main part?
2754257	2755677	Tell us about some of the characters or something.
2756857	2758058	The best character is Kyo.
2759118	2760098	Because he's violent.
2761478	2762159	I like violence.
2762179	2762899	And you like violence.
2762919	2763299	That's all.
2765599	2769300	And no, I'm not watching Naruto because everybody in the goddamn universe is watching Naruto.
2769320	2770300	I'm not watching it.
2770640	2771260	I don't watch it.
2771960	2772801	I've been reading the manga, though.
2772821	2773461	I don't watch it.
2774141	2775401	But I don't watch any anime.
2775621	2778282	The fact that they got me to watch Ranma is amazing.
2778462	2779362	So, anyway.
2780253	2784856	Moving on, Bradley, Arcadian42, our quiet man in the corner there.
2785136	2785736	How was your week?
2785756	2786196	How was your day?
2787097	2789578	My week was just a regular old week.
2790119	2792980	Work and not much else.
2794421	2801185	Though I've had, for like the past two weeks, I've had crappy cold and sniffly and coffee and all this kind of crap.
2802045	2804887	Kind of probably the same stuff that Jamie's had.
2804907	2806908	It's kind of, it's annoying.
2807974	2811996	This weekend I played some old school Super Nintendo games.
2812216	2815358	Played Actraiser and played Link to the Past.
2816418	2817859	Those are two very sexy games.
2818519	2822861	Yes, and that's about everything I did of any interest at all.
2825262	2825902	On to the next.
2826583	2829504	I was just thinking about Actraiser for a minute and what a great game that is.
2833255	2833455	What?
2834135	2834616	What, DarkSakura?
2834656	2837938	I don't know, people keep mentioning stuff that makes me remember the stuff I did during the week.
2839259	2840439	What did you think of now?
2841500	2844302	Last night, falling asleep watching Dan play Metroid.
2845102	2846423	Super Metroid or like old school?
2846443	2846863	Metroid.
2847704	2848424	Oh, that's hot.
2848504	2849225	And Bionic Commando.
2850105	2850566	Man.
2850706	2851866	Watching Hitler blow up.
2852187	2853327	All these sexy games.
2853908	2855949	We need to have like a sexy retro night.
2855969	2856049	Yeah.
2856852	2863876	No, if you're going to do that, though, I'm going to be bringing over... No, I'll bring over Sexy Parodius.
2865097	2868019	I'll bring over the... Sexy Parodius didn't have an arcade release.
2868559	2872642	I think we need to play... This is what we're going to play.
2873262	2875724	We would have to play Actraiser, even though it's not multiplayer.
2875764	2877485	We could have it on for like 30 minutes at least.
2878045	2879826	And then we would play Guardian Legend.
2880407	2881988	We would all sit around and watch... Oh, hell yeah!
2882048	2884169	We would all sit around and watch me play Guardian Legend.
2884709	2885770	Because that game is awesome.
2886477	2898862	and then we would sit around and watch me play A Link to the Past and then you guys are going to sit around and watch me play Actaracer again and then you would sit around and watch me play Metroid and then what else can you guys watch me play?
2899942	2901083	Doesn't this night sound like fun?
2903164	2905505	I just thought of one but you're going to hit me so never mind.
2906905	2911327	You'd be playing Guardian Legend and then I'd take the controller and show you how to play Guardian Legend.
2911347	2913488	Oh snap!
2913808	2915609	The only levels I actually couldn't beat there were 10 and 20.
2917854	2920215	Angel, how was your week?
2920235	2920835	How was your day?
2941502	2942102	Pretty good.
2943183	2945444	Had to get ready for school and stuff because that starts this week.
2945605	2945945	Yay.
2947426	2952749	Didn't play too, too much of that evil game that I can't mention now because you're going to fire me, right?
2956671	2960654	Lots of... Well, I played a little bit of it, but whatever.
2962275	2963856	Other than that, not too, too much.
2963896	2964976	I do have to work tomorrow, though.
2965597	2965957	Dope.
2966717	2967198	Dope.
2967898	2968138	Yuck.
2969239	2969499	I don't.
2970086	2970927	Yeah, well, oh well.
2971247	2972348	Yeah, see, Loki does.
2974069	2974849	Uh, not too much.
2975710	2976250	Other than that.
2977150	2983835	Oh, and, um, LiveJournal went down this week, if anybody knew about that, for 24 hours.
2984315	2986916	Oh my god, my world ended when LiveJournal collapsed.
2986957	2987697	No, I'm kidding, it didn't.
2987737	2992420	But seriously, did you notice how many people suddenly were like, I have to go outside.
2993040	2993941	LiveJournal's down.
2995197	3003403	Yeah, that was pretty funny, because as soon as it came back up, all of my friends were going, Oh my god, I couldn't live without LiveJournal!
3004124	3004924	Oh my god, it's back up!
3004965	3005205	What?
3005445	3011429	As soon as it went back up, everybody was posting about it and whatever, so everyone had their withdrawal.
3011830	3023839	I only jumped on just to see, you know, what friends lists were doing and all that stuff, and to see if a certain other show was going on, but I couldn't do that because LiveJournal was down, so...
3025520	3028701	Speaking of LiveJournal, what an excellent chance to plug our community.
3029161	3030522	We actually have a LiveJournal community.
3030582	3032043	It's username OrangeLounge.
3032103	3032523	Check it out.
3032823	3033923	That's really difficult to remember.
3034364	3036244	Some of us, though, had DeadJournals to go to.
3038485	3041326	And DeadJournals that never get used unless LiveJournal's down, right?
3041486	3041987	Exactly.
3042867	3043207	All right.
3043587	3043907	Fair enough.
3045448	3045848	Let's see.
3045928	3047149	So that's it for your weekend day?
3048469	3052391	Before I forget, I forgot to mention the website for that Rose game.
3052471	3053991	It's RoseOn.com.
3054031	3054612	It's all one word.
3055212	3055412	All right.
3057105	3057986	I love the chat room.
3058226	3065831	I'm sorry because I don't know who said this first, but another game at our sexy retro game-a-thon where you guys are going to sit around and watch me play games.
3066552	3067372	Blaster Master.
3067392	3074777	You guys are going to sit around and watch me play Blaster Master because that would be probably the second best 8-bit game ever made.
3074917	3077499	That's when I actually bring over the collection.
3079160	3081042	And I have to say, the collection.
3081842	3085485	Yeah, and then we can sit around and talk about how much the other Blaster Master games sucked.
3086850	3100195	All of the Mega Man games to date, up to, I think, I think I have that through X4 on Saturn, and then I have, like, I think 5 and 6, and then that's it.
3100635	3102236	But I have all of the NES ones.
3103056	3104056	You know what would be great?
3105117	3106237	I will never forget this.
3106297	3112119	One of the very first times I met DarkSakura, I went to her house, actually, because I got invited to her house pretty quick.
3113039	3114360	And when I walked in,
3115373	3117954	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3135776	3136276	I noticed that.
3137416	3139997	I have no idea why, but there was one random Splatterhouse.
3140417	3144578	All these guys in the house playing Zelda and yelling and screaming.
3144598	3145338	It was awesome.
3145418	3146018	I was in heaven.
3146678	3147959	And didn't you call that a LAN party?
3148139	3149339	A local area Nintendo party?
3149359	3150279	Yeah, it was a LAN party.
3150459	3151319	Local area Nintendo.
3151479	3153240	And they did the same with Mega Man 2 after.
3153260	3156920	See, I was going to say, you need to do something like that, but on each TV have a different Mega Man game.
3156940	3159621	That would be so hot.
3161027	3164688	Watching Andrew do that in an hour was scary as hell.
3164708	3165888	I'm going, holy crap!
3166249	3167169	But that's Andrew for you.
3167189	3167989	He's Mega Man boy.
3168089	3180253	I've done the dragon level of... I've actually beat the dragon on Mega Man 2 blindfolded.
3182293	3182913	That's hot.
3183073	3188635	I can't do it now, but when I played that game all the damn time, I had all of my jumps
3189150	3196453	It's like, basically, when you get to the platform right before you jump, that's when I was blindfolded, and I made all my jumps, hit it up there, and knew exactly where all my jumps were.
3196613	3209579	I could see, like, I could just picture it in my mind, Jamie sitting there in her camo, with a blindfold on, and the controller in her hand, and a candy cigarette in her mouth, because not a real one, because she doesn't smoke, but a candy cigarette in her mouth, just sitting there, bring it on.
3211080	3211620	Whatever.
3212963	3215464	It's like a non-flashback or something.
3215724	3221166	The only other game I can play blindfolded is level 8-1 on Super Mario Bros.
3222287	3224548	Dark Knight says Jamie was like Zen.
3226228	3227869	You channeled your Zen warrior power.
3227929	3229469	That is supreme geekness.
3229489	3231170	I didn't even know I had any when I was 12.
3231390	3231930	So hot.
3233171	3233471	Alright.
3234631	3238413	And then I'm being poked fun of in the chat room for going over to a girl's house.
3239233	3241734	Don't you know they have goodies?
3242783	3243883	Don't you know they have cooties?
3245384	3248304	Remember the one guy who had his computer case built out of a toolbox?
3248804	3249004	Yes.
3249264	3249865	That was cool.
3252885	3253885	It was a camo toolbox.
3257606	3257926	Okay.
3258346	3260727	I'm wallowing in geek right now.
3260767	3261247	This is funny.
3261287	3261527	All right.
3261867	3262247	Moving on.
3263387	3264367	Explicit joined us.
3264467	3265468	He walked in during the break.
3265608	3267268	Also, Tardy there.
3267668	3268348	Mr. Tardy.
3269108	3269768	Yeah, all right.
3269828	3271689	Well, Explicit, how was your week?
3271729	3272229	How was your day?
3273601	3274221	It was pretty cool.
3276482	3278163	Some ups and downs, but most likely ups.
3278683	3279644	Any games you were playing this week?
3282165	3286027	Well, I finished Metroid Prime 2 in like one week.
3286567	3287107	That's about it.
3288728	3290129	And beat Final Fantasy 2.
3291089	3292850	The Dawn of Souls one?
3293290	3294231	In three days.
3295091	3295491	Jeez.
3296191	3299373	I feel like I can't touch Final Fantasy 2 until I beat Final Fantasy 1.
3300313	3301674	2 is a bitch to level up on.
3302879	3303940	You have to get used to the system.
3304801	3306622	I hear you can do something in the beginning, though.
3306662	3307343	Make it really easy.
3307383	3309404	Like, you level up your characters uber strong in the beginning.
3309424	3314909	You have enough time in your hands to cheat and level up so you can... There's always time for cheating.
3317030	3317370	Oh, yeah.
3317411	3319092	I'll explain that on the FU's.
3319492	3319832	Alright.
3321574	3322715	Anything else going on with your week?
3323435	3328039	Well, man, I was thinking of getting into a relationship with a close friend of mine, and you know that's about it.
3329231	3331153	Oh, relations, huh?
3332274	3332735	That's cool.
3332775	3333936	You've been having relations.
3337079	3340843	And also, updates on the tournament on February 5th.
3341664	3343946	Okay, you're having a tournament in Sacto February 5th?
3343986	3345708	Sacto Smackdown February 5th.
3346328	3347289	I love these Jesus tournament names.
3347309	3350152	Or some people call it Piss because it says Sacto Smackdown.
3353091	3357475	Paradise Island Sacktown Smackdown, you're calling your tournament piss?
3357535	3358596	No, it was not expected!
3360357	3362719	Okay, but scat was funny, but piss is really funny.
3363579	3366342	It was not expected, I was just like, oh my gosh.
3366442	3370085	And now, for the golden shower round!
3372426	3374348	Where we shower you with gold!
3376777	3378698	Can I co-emcee that tournament or something?
3379038	3379438	Go ahead.
3379478	3385100	So I can come out and then throw gold glitter in the air and say, It's a golden shower here at Piss.
3386861	3387381	Go ahead.
3387421	3389142	Do whatever you want in the tournament.
3394949	3397211	Sorry, this is so 7th grade, but I don't care.
3397731	3399172	Do the posters say piss?
3399593	3402695	No, Chaos is the one that came up with it.
3403095	3404637	It's like, ooh, it spells piss.
3404937	3409941	I was trying to prevent the word from saying ass.
3410221	3412523	Like, ASAC tells Smackdown, but now it says piss.
3412583	3416426	Yeah, because, you know, ass would have been... Ass is looking pretty good right now, huh?
3417066	3422170	That's the only time I'm going to get him to admit... Oh my gosh.
3422711	3423051	Alright.
3424945	3425366	That's great.
3425406	3426766	What kind of tournaments are you having again?
3427086	3427446	At Piss?
3427547	3429928	Okay, it starts at 11 or 12 o'clock.
3430568	3434570	It will contain DDR, PA, which is... The Piss begins at noon!
3434590	3437611	Oh my god.
3441192	3445114	I think I just killed Sky on this one.
3445634	3448576	So will you be starting off on Heavy and then working your way to Light?
3450777	3451757	Actually, that's two divisions.
3453840	3457762	The Perfect Piss, and the Freestyle Piss.
3459603	3466307	Oh my god.
3466968	3468729	The first round, of course, is a PA.
3469749	3475533	The first round will determine if you're going to the intermediate or the expert division.
3476093	3476953	If you're applicable.
3477334	3479655	Hopefully you'll make it, unless you're really like the lowest seed.
3483903	3485243	Oh my gosh.
3486264	3493226	What the hell?
3494506	3495106	Oh my god.
3496887	3499128	Did you finally taste that piss in the bottle?
3499408	3502069	Fucking Dr. Pepper nasty shit?
3502089	3503989	Did it finally hit you?
3504549	3506470	Honestly, because that stuff looks nasty.
3507170	3511291	Diet Dr. Pepper cherry vanilla ass juice.
3511451	3512392	Oh my god.
3514687	3524372	For those that couldn't see what just happened, I had one of those moments where I was about to laugh really, really hard because Loki just gave me that look of I'm thinking something really funny right now.
3525372	3528594	And I had to run over to the kitchen sink and spit out the drink.
3529394	3531615	And I was of course drinking that Dr. Pepper.
3532940	3533400	I'm sorry.
3533880	3534861	I'm sorry, Explicit.
3534881	3535481	Go ahead and finish.
3535501	3535841	It's alright.
3535921	3536461	It's alright.
3537101	3539362	Everyone's all cracking up with the title, Piss.
3540723	3548245	Okay, there's also initial D version 3 tournaments for those interested in racing their cars.
3550426	3556908	So that should be, it's also going to be held at the same time with DDR PA as well, so time goes faster.
3558124	3559585	And there's a freestyle at 6 o'clock.
3560006	3562608	This should be pretty interesting, a two-rounded DDR freestyle.
3563329	3566471	The first round is an improv with a prop.
3566992	3568233	You get to use a prop.
3569133	3572516	So you know the initial D term in there.
3572937	3575399	You could actually call it I'd Piss because, you know.
3577480	3581264	The initial D, Paradise Island, Sacktown Smackdown.
3583325	3583666	Two.
3584787	3585307	Oh my god.
3586400	3586740	Whatever.
3586780	3588021	Okay, I'm done with the piss jokes.
3589061	3589581	I'm sorry.
3589621	3592663	We will bury the piss jokes, but you have to admit, it's funny.
3592883	3595044	I know.
3595324	3598445	I never expected it to be called that initials.
3598926	3599266	Alright.
3600206	3600907	That's great.
3600987	3601347	Alright.
3601807	3602147	Let's see.
3602767	3604428	Of course, the last round is the routines.
3605329	3608370	Keep in mind that you can actually do a group routine if you wish to.
3608390	3610111	For two group pissing.
3611912	3612872	Sorry, sorry, sorry.
3612932	3613272	I'm sorry.
3613312	3613712	That's the last.
3613812	3614613	I swear that was the last.
3614673	3615053	I'm sorry.
3624985	3627688	I come in from the bathroom and you're still talking about piss?
3629930	3631972	What would you do without me to babysit you?
3632012	3638178	Don't be pissed off This show is so full of shit
3639548	3641710	Not tonight, it's full of pee.
3642110	3645513	You know what you should give as refreshment to everybody at the tournament?
3645593	3646613	Okay, okay, seriously?
3646674	3648475	No, no, no.
3648555	3651077	Red Bull and little plastic clear cups.
3651617	3652858	Because Red Bull looks like pee.
3656261	3657802	Okay, this seriously has to stop.
3659824	3664127	When I said that this show went to the toilet, I wasn't literal, you guys.
3665088	3665628	Well, you know.
3666966	3669207	And now our chat room is just going off.
3673487	3675168	Okay, breathe in.
3676508	3681389	Alright, so February 5th is when it all goes down.
3682930	3685790	It all goes down February 5th.
3685810	3690851	Oh yeah, by the way, there will be food supplied as well for those who enter the tournament.
3690871	3691372	And Red Bull.
3692592	3692712	Yep.
3694528	3698050	Yes, everyone, be sure to come out and PA with us.
3701091	3705313	Alright, that was bad.
3705493	3707174	I think we need a break.
3709255	3714317	In this break, we're going to hear some music that was in some various Japanese DDR releases.
3714717	3715437	Some of the newer ones.
3715477	3720059	I just wanted an excuse to play Superstar and Paranoia Respect and some cool songs.
3720380	3720980	So we're going to hear that.
3721600	3727104	and then we're going to come back and we actually have some Bomani news I want to talk about when we come back, believe it or not.
3727464	3730966	There's actually a new Bomani game being tested right now.
3731827	3733228	Is it the DDR with Mario?
3733728	3734089	No, no, no.
3734149	3735149	We talked about that last week.
3735169	3737891	There's no new details on DDR Mario yet unless I missed something.
3737911	3739372	I'll check to see if there's any new details on that.
3739672	3741233	There's another new one that's being tested right now.
3741253	3742414	I'm going to talk about that when we come back.
3744596	3747658	And we will... I'll do Aoi Shodown next break.
3748038	3748358	That's cool.
3748438	3748618	Okay.
3749139	3751060	We'll be back after this with more
3751713	3753294	Orange Lounge Radio
3776553	3784760	I don't know what it is that makes me feel like this I don't know who you are But you must be some kind of superstar
3804702	3807283	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3822193	3832405	No matter where you are No matter where you are I don't know who you are I don't know who you are I don't know who you are I don't know who you are
3933684	3934225	Thanks for watching!
3976394	3977095	What's going on?
3977115	3977795	What's going on?
4018155	4020376	Thank you for watching.
4020416	4021736	See you next time.
4051864	4053085	Orange Lounge Radio.
4053426	4055587	We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.
4062413	4067698	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, recovering a little bit during that break here, and we're back.
4068959	4072022	And, you know, it's been kind of a slow week in the Bomani world.
4072082	4076726	Not a whole lot of news, but there was one pretty big thing.
4077418	4079278	That I thought was pretty interesting.
4079659	4083900	And it's actually something that kind of, I don't know, it's been leaking around on various live journals out there.
4084420	4086880	And now you're seeing it kind of pop up on DDR Freak as well.
4086900	4089281	I know somebody had posted about it over there in the forums over there.
4089881	4094722	And it's actually a new game by Konami that's being tested right now.
4095222	4097343	And it's a game called Dance 86.4.
4099443	4103124	Like, I guess it's supposed to be some kind of radio station parody or something, you know?
4103284	4103424	Yeah.
4104070	4116358	I think Raichan posted something about it in her live journal, and she posted a picture of the actual machine, and on the title she was like, Nuba Money Game?
4116498	4125804	And I saw it and I'm like, dang, that's pretty cool, except it was funny because one of her friends commented and said that the bars were smaller.
4127304	4129545	Well, yeah, this looks like a game that's obviously geared at kids.
4129585	4132607	I just posted a link in the chatroom if you guys hadn't seen this yet.
4133007	4136289	And there's some pictures, some full-length pictures you can bring up of what this game looks like.
4136989	4139270	Looks very kid-like.
4139350	4149296	Like, you could say poppin' music-like, but then again, we all know poppin' music was a game that was kind of aimed at kids originally, and it's now quickly become, like, one of the tougher Bomani series.
4149316	4151857	Some would argue it's the toughest Bomani series, but that's, you know...
4152452	4153473	Something you could be argued about.
4153933	4157077	Has a very similar look to DDR, except I noticed this.
4158298	4158998	Three panels.
4159699	4160059	That's it.
4160680	4161481	You got a left...
4162125	4163146	Middle, right.
4163626	4166947	Which sort of reminds me of DDR Solo's three-panel mode, if you remember that.
4166987	4169949	I don't know, but DDR Solo had like a three-panel mode that was very similar.
4170729	4174851	And you can see in these screenshots, you can see a little character there dancing.
4175391	4178033	Looks very similar to the DDR concept.
4178093	4182875	It's a little hard to tell without some moving screenshots, but that's what we see right now.
4183215	4188938	And then these little miniature bars that this time, they're in the front as opposed to the back.
4190365	4195026	So why you have the bars in the front as opposed to the back, I have no idea, but that's the way it's built.
4195527	4197407	So, take that as you will.
4197787	4198888	Now here's the other interesting thing.
4198908	4206410	When looking at the song list, some of the early songs that are supposed to be in this, you'll notice there's a couple songs that were actually in DDR Festival that are showing up here.
4207030	4210171	One of them being the Cutie Honey theme that was in DDR Festival.
4210531	4219714	So some of those are crossing over into this new Dance 86.4 game, which is very interesting, I must say.
4220405	4248671	and yeah, I'm being corrected in the chat room that the three panel solo mode was actually bottom was involved so you weren't just moving back and forth side to side like this one set up where three arrows are all next to each other it was kind of like you could do upper left or left and upper right or right and then bottom so you kind of had a little bit of different motion but this one is kind of like, I don't know I would think that the way you would dance to this would be more like a hoedown but obviously this is something that's written or being done for kids I don't know, we'll see
4250916	4252638	Any comment on this game?
4252778	4254519	The Dance 86.4 Funky Raider Station?
4258022	4262886	I'll have to... You know, I would think that they would have just done the Ohasta.
4264288	4265368	I know, kind of weird, huh?
4265569	4267931	Oh, you posted some more pictures there, didn't you, Loki?
4268351	4269032	Okay, very cool.
4270533	4272755	What I think is kind of weird about this is that
4274518	4279887	Part of me is kind of scared because you hear that we are starting over with DDR Extreme.
4280248	4281250	Is this starting over?
4282557	4283517	This isn't even DDR.
4283537	4284778	You're not even close.
4284818	4286638	This is a spin-off of Bishi Bashi.
4286658	4287298	That's all it is.
4287718	4294400	It's just like they have the Bishi Bashi type dancing game thing that had three... It was exactly like this, except it wasn't on stage.
4294460	4296140	It was just on some stupid little pad.
4296920	4297901	They have it at AI.
4298161	4299801	It's honestly, it's nothing new.
4299841	4300901	It's nothing exciting.
4300941	4303062	It's just like a new Bishi Bashi game.
4303102	4307243	They actually had... There's some other shit I posted, too, in here that was kind of funny.
4308163	4311264	There was... Where did I put it here?
4313085	4315708	Um... Oh, this one right here.
4316148	4317909	I'm all, looks like Banjo Freaks.
4318230	4321373	And, you know, it's, um, some, like, banjo game thing.
4321393	4324295	They have, like, a bunch of stuff that was on this one website here.
4325456	4328819	Keep it alive, Namco came out with a whole bunch of music games I never saw.
4328839	4330000	Location testing.
4330320	4336145	Um, like, yeah, they have the, um, this karaoke game, I think, that's actually, um...
4337086	4343670	Idolmaster, another Namco music game that's coming out where you have to become a pop idol type thing.
4344790	4348192	Of course, Guitar Freaks V, they have stuff about that.
4348752	4353655	And then Funky Radio Station Dance 86.4.
4355956	4357677	But yeah, I don't know.
4357697	4361899	It looks interesting, I guess.
4366027	4372151	So, I don't know, I can't help but feel a little bit of, come on guys, you gotta work on this game.
4372171	4373191	Where's my new DDR?
4373452	4373912	Where is it?
4374252	4374492	Where?
4375833	4379055	I don't want this Dance 86.4, so I want DDR.
4379755	4380796	Where's my DDR, Loki?
4384124	4386746	Uh, you just got, um, Festival on me.
4386866	4387767	Shit, what do you want?
4387887	4388808	I want Arcade DDR!
4388828	4392570	They can, they're, I can't believe they're making this whole new machine, this D&D 644.
4392850	4398674	Okay, and I understand, maybe there's a market for kid games and stuff, but, eh, it's frustrating.
4399575	4402897	Why are they spending time on this when they could be making me a beautiful new DDR machine?
4404658	4405559	Because this is cheaper.
4405579	4408581	Alright.
4408681	4408821	Anyway.
4411463	4411763	Anyway.
4413646	4414566	Uh, let's move on.
4416287	4418187	Loki, what's going on in the sim scene right now, anything?
4420728	4429151	Yeah, finally, finally, the sim files have been released for DDR Ultramix 2, Dancing Stage Fusion, and Festival.
4430331	4432952	Finally, they're, well, done, I guess.
4433512	4433592	Um.
4434298	4438980	They would be found at... Well, they have a preliminary thing up right now.
4439140	4442102	It's pretty much... I mean, they're as done as far as you and I are concerned.
4442542	4447585	Because... I mean, oh no, they're missing the beginner steps on doubles.
4447985	4448825	Woo!
4449305	4450026	Oh my god!
4450046	4451867	But other than that, it's perfectly fine.
4451887	4452867	They have them all done.
4453968	4458650	Including, I think, the first... No, not the first service pack.
4458670	4460271	But everything else is done on it.
4460491	4460571	Um...
4462372	4472517	Now, I have a very long link I'll post later for where you can find these at, but check in DDRUK if you want to know.
4473598	4481602	Keep up to date with their progress on SongPack 6 and 7, or 7, whatever the two new ones are.
4482902	4484403	Because that's what's going to be happening there.
4484923	4486264	DDR Maniacs is still down.
4486504	4490366	Also, I think, I'm not sure if I mentioned it, because like I said, I can't remember...
4491195	4496858	There was the Legend of Tak, the Gravity, DarkSakura, Burn Nation mix, and the Ecstasy 14 Hours Club mix, I believe.
4519344	4520865	No, that was an older one.
4521885	4522945	Anyways.
4523986	4528207	So yeah, that's pretty much all that's going on right now, scene-wise.
4528347	4535690	Oh, that and Bomani's still talking about rolling out a site called Simulation Style, which I think is like Bomani Sims 2.0 type thing.
4536530	4538651	That's supposedly coming out later on.
4540652	4540992	That's it.
4543793	4544593	Alrighty.
4545834	4546754	Jamie, how you doing over there?
4548476	4550117	Anything interesting going on on the forums over there?
4551217	4561061	There isn't crap happening on DDR Freak right now Except someone PM'd me asking me what post-touring is Could you explain for the masses what post-touring is?
4561321	4576527	When you post a whole bunch of stuff unnecessarily especially for people who post three damn times in a row instead of editing your post I consider that to be a version of post-touring Okay
4577179	4581201	But, no, there's not really a whole major lot going on the forums.
4581681	4583802	Yeah, so, you know, slow news week.
4584122	4584722	Slow news week.
4585243	4586143	Slow everything.
4587043	4590545	I think people are just trying to get adjusted to the new year, maybe.
4592535	4598623	I think everybody's kind of sitting on things until E3, so we're in for a slow couple of months.
4599163	4606172	I don't know, there is this stuff kind of brewing in Japan with DDR Mario and supposedly being showed at that show that's going on right now.
4606212	4607514	I'm surprised we haven't heard anything about it.
4607814	4612395	I'm sure it'll leak out on the net in the next few days, depending on what capacity this game's being shown in.
4613155	4620557	And, you know, as far as these new games getting test locations and stuff, we'll just kind of have to get the news as we get it.
4621237	4624538	Otherwise, as far as American releases go, we're probably not going to hear anything until E3.
4624558	4625298	That'll be the big time.
4625338	4632300	Because, you know, if there is a new DDR game coming out this year, which I'm confident there's going to be, we won't get the details until E3.
4632360	4635241	So, we're in for a very interesting next few months.
4636941	4637201	All right.
4637588	4639929	You guys ready to have a cage match?
4642250	4642871	Yes, please.
4643151	4643771	Alright, here we go.
4643791	4644872	Orange Launch Radio cage match.
4648714	4653316	The way the cage match works, we play three songs for your listening pleasure.
4654036	4664862	And the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Launch Radio Live's Vimani Music and More program, which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on this station when we're not here.
4666986	4667987	The song is called Joe LaTaxi
4693332	4699481	If you want to participate in the cage match, you've got to be in our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on chat.
4699961	4707752	Here it is, song number one, Oria Posey, Joe LaTaxi, the Jan Wayne remix radio cut.
4707912	4708253	Enjoy.
4784099	4784480	S, Actdeft
4843931	4854715	Having mics on would help There it is, song number one tonight A clip of Joe LaTaxi Alright, will Joe LaTaxi win again?
4854795	4861958	We shall find out But we have to put two new songs up against it And the next song comes from Loki Loki, what are you putting in tonight?
4862759	4863999	Is it a remix of Girls?
4866280	4873563	No No, it's not a remix of Girls Because I haven't cut those down to size yet So that's the only reason why you're not getting Girls
4875273	4882655	I will make a remix of that song if I have to in order to make another entry.
4884015	4885215	But this is not gross.
4885635	4894837	This is our favorite friend, MidiHead, and his debut track that is going to be on his next album that he demoed for the wonderful people on his website.
4894897	4897098	Unfortunately, you have to buy something or be a member or whatever.
4898058	4899458	So, this is exclusive.
4900498	4901419	Not released yet.
4901499	4901899	This is...
4904529	4906990	This is Take Me Away by MidiHead.
4908630	4909810	Does he know that you're doing this?
4910930	4911091	No.
4911731	4915271	So, you're bootlegging... God, if we get a nasty letter, it's your ass.
4915331	4916092	Alright, here it is.
4917232	4920873	I'm, you know... I'm creating buzz.
4921253	4921593	Okay.
4922213	4922473	Buzz.
4923873	4924713	Buzz is not bad.
4924933	4925493	Buzz is good.
4927754	4929714	Alright, let's see what kind of buzz this generates.
4929754	4930094	Here it is.
4930134	4931415	Song number two, MidiHead.
4931895	4932475	Take Me Away.
4932535	4932815	Enjoy.
4936190	4949635	Don't you take me away from here Away from all this madness Take me away from here Away from all the madness
5128455	5129252	Thank you for watching!
5198956	5200498	Let's go around and see what they thought.
5200959	5201659	What we thought.
5202681	5204082	Excuse me, Jamie, your thoughts.
5205124	5205604	Alright, Explicit.
5221389	5223311	7 from Explicit, Arcadian 6 from Arcadian, Loki Angel
5247803	5253419	I really do like mom book stuff, so, and it was really kind of bouncy kind of thing.
5253459	5253640	Eight.
5255959	5257420	Yeah, I like Monolithic quite a bit too.
5257660	5259742	I think he has a very distinct voice.
5260062	5260802	It's different.
5261323	5264165	It's not for everybody, but I don't know.
5264665	5272290	The only thing about that song for me is that I think he said this on his forums too, which is why I kind of gave Loki a funny look when he put this song in.
5272370	5275952	I think he said the song isn't quite finished yet, that it's kind of still a work in progress.
5276413	5276793	Yes, it is.
5276853	5277353	It's a demo.
5277373	5281036	Yeah, and see, it's got that demo feel to me, like it's missing...
5282821	5284382	Something, there's something missing.
5284442	5286584	I can't put my finger on it, but I'm not the musician.
5287425	5289146	I'm not going to figure out exactly what it is.
5289586	5290286	But I like it.
5290447	5291727	I like what I hear so far.
5292208	5294389	I definitely will pick up his next album when it comes out.
5294870	5296831	If for no other reason than I just think he's a cool guy.
5297231	5298952	So I give it an 8.
5299893	5300834	Alright, so an 8 for me.
5302855	5304916	And moving on, it's my turn to pick a song.
5304956	5307398	And I really didn't want to do this tonight.
5307718	5309159	I did not want to put this song in.
5309199	5310640	Surprisingly enough, I didn't want to do this.
5311241	5311461	But...
5312552	5323377	I feel like I have been listening to nothing but this song non-stop this week that I would be doing myself a personal injustice to not put this song in the cage match tonight.
5325058	5326058	And no, it's not girls.
5326398	5326719	Sorry.
5328035	5328996	Thank you for watching!
5350880	5351701	Thanks for watching!
5431880	5432461	Thanks for watching!
5501784	5502666	Thanks for watching!
5532361	5533483	Get Bumped!
5645652	5646993	Alright, that was song number three.
5647753	5649834	Echo Image with Endless Day.
5649934	5651255	Let's find out the scores.
5651475	5651775	Jamie.
5652435	5653396	I actually really like that.
5653876	5657758	Except I think his voice is just slightly over for that one.
5658198	5659419	Like it's a little too loud.
5659939	5663981	Because on the other ones I've heard he has a really nice blend with the music.
5665162	5670184	Almost in Ben Halen's Sammy Hagar era type blending.
5670945	5673186	This one I think is a little overpowering, so I give it a nine.
5673926	5674827	Alright, nine from Jamie.
5674867	5675267	Explicit.
5677574	5678495	I actually like the song.
5678515	5682138	I give it like an 8.5.
5683099	5687723	But there's something about it that just makes it far from perfect in a way.
5688243	5689084	It's a very great song.
5689104	5692426	It has a lot of originality and variation.
5693367	5694468	It's very good music.
5694748	5696030	It has an all-ticket cutter.
5697871	5699132	I don't know.
5699272	5703756	I think the pauses is what kills the song.
5703876	5704797	Not a big fan of pauses.
5705376	5708938	Well, I like some of the positive, but it looks like it's done wrong in a way.
5708998	5709538	I'm not sure.
5710218	5712099	I just don't feel like it's something appealing.
5712660	5712880	Alright.
5713080	5714460	Other than that, it's a very good song.
5714721	5714981	Alright.
5715441	5715761	Fair enough.
5715821	5716201	Arcadian.
5716742	5717102	That's good.
5717122	5717682	I'll give it an 8.
5718382	5718663	Loki.
5720383	5721464	I give it a 10 because it's awesome.
5722865	5723425	Uh, Angel.
5723445	5726606	10 because it's Echo Image and it's still awesome.
5728187	5731569	Uh, me, my opinion, in my opinion...
5732540	5735342	For me, that song is perfection.
5735722	5742827	And that is the first true 10 I would give to any song in the past 120 episodes that we've done this K-Dimension.
5743207	5743447	To me.
5744668	5744968	Alright.
5747310	5747670	That's it.
5747730	5748411	Let's see.
5748511	5749732	It's time for you guys to vote.
5750292	5755315	And we're going to place your votes in a minute here after this quick recap of the three songs you can vote for tonight.
5755395	5757437	Song number one, Jolitaxi.
5768961	5772503	Song number two, Midi Head, Take Me Away.
5782548	5785230	I'm picking really bad clips of the songs tonight, I'm sorry guys.
5785530	5788111	And song number three, Echo Image, Endless Day.
5789131	5790532	Yes, I had my reasons after all
5798187	5800909	Alright, place vote now.
5801009	5807814	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote for song number 1, 2, or 3.
5808354	5818641	You can call them Joe LaTaxi, Take Me Away, Endless Day, Echo Image, Midi Head, and if you can pronounce the other one, that's fine by me too.
5819301	5820862	Whatever will get the message across.
5820922	5821703	Alright, moving on.
5822873	5823794	More stuff going on.
5823854	5827797	So when it is a slow news week, I like to go around and I like to browse some of the forums.
5828138	5832381	And I like to be inspired by certain topics that are going on in some of the various web forums.
5832441	5835224	Of course, one of the largest being DDR Freak.
5835324	5839728	And, of course, we like DDR Freak because not only do we have a host who happens to be a moderator there.
5840709	5841389	I wonder who that is.
5842190	5842690	I think it's you.
5843431	5844472	Oh, I forgot.
5845453	5847555	Our webmaster is a moderator there.
5847975	5848235	And then...
5849537	5851979	Several of our frequent guests are moderators there.
5852119	5853079	One's an admin.
5853279	5853940	Yeah, there you go.
5853980	5855621	And then we get rerun.
5855661	5856462	The admin.
5856622	5859403	And now we are a small part of DDR Freak.
5859463	5869330	We have to bring the site down with our dumb little show we do, which you can hear Friday nights at 6 o'clock over on DDR Freak Radio, which is a cool station.
5869350	5869690	Check it out.
5870661	5873283	Don't you wish you had a girlfriend that played DDR?
5873343	5877065	This is like every guy I know's dream to have a girl that will play DDR and actually be good.
5897972	5899753	I mean, come on, wouldn't that just be awesome?
5900153	5902675	I mean, except for the part where she steals all the glory or whatnot.
5905537	5907858	Wouldn't that be cool to have a girlfriend that plays DDR?
5908358	5908638	Loki.
5908678	5910740	There goes another F you.
5911100	5914022	Wouldn't it be awesome to actually touch a real girl?
5918384	5919905	Wouldn't it be awesome to get laid?
5920826	5924087	Wouldn't it be awesome to rape a woman instead of a freaking bar?
5924107	5924147	No.
5925608	5925848	No.
5926149	5926329	No.
5928030	5928590	Not at all.
5931052	5932813	God, this is sad.
5934054	5935535	Someday I'll get laid!
5937897	5941179	Jamie, don't you wish you had a girlfriend that played DDR?
5942860	5943541	Well, I don't know.
5943561	5944942	I have to ask my fiancé.
5947404	5949885	Jamie, surely you must have some kind of comment on this.
5951206	5951687	Let me look here.
5951727	5953368	Let me find that quote again.
5954428	5956450	To have a girl that will play DDR...
5957034	5958215	and actually be good!
5961336	5962477	I wouldn't know anything about that.
5965138	5968160	So are you saying that there's no girls that are actually good at DDR out there?
5969761	5970741	Well, of course we are.
5971522	5976904	Even though you can pass CATAs and... You know what?
5978065	5982087	My comment is completely off the record as we are probably being recorded by a few people.
5982327	5983028	Alright, fine.
5983588	5983828	But...
5984525	5987988	That's probably the most dumb thread I've ever freaking heard of in my life.
5988008	5992111	That's almost as dumb as show off your cell phone.
5993332	5994673	Which is going on a random chat right now.
5994733	5997635	This has turned out to be a dumbass, dumbass revolution.
5998416	6003900	Well, hey, you know, the guy just wants a girlfriend that I can sort of see.
6004300	6008283	Don't we want to date people that have similar interests sometimes?
6008423	6012627	But you've got people like DJ Ness saying, ooh, is there any hot girls in NorCal?
6013247	6014328	Or shit like this.
6015367	6016808	No, no, you know what?
6017289	6019551	There are no girls in NorCal, actually.
6019591	6020331	We should tell them that.
6020351	6021372	There's actually no girls here.
6021652	6023553	It's one big gay bar, actually.
6024674	6026115	I'm not responding to this.
6027016	6029518	You know, why would they even ask?
6029578	6030959	Is there any hotties in NorCal?
6030999	6032740	Like, they're gonna talk to you, sure.
6035082	6037964	Okay, if you gotta ask, they're not gonna talk.
6039425	6040506	I mean, really, really.
6041105	6041225	Oh!
6041445	6042526	Someone's looking for Hotties!
6042766	6043906	Maybe I'll go date him!
6044226	6045006	I mean, really.
6045667	6047967	Cause I really go to an arcade to pick up dates.
6048567	6049468	I drive a ricer!
6049748	6050368	I am pimp!
6050928	6051528	Date me!
6052689	6054069	Oh my gosh.
6054869	6057390	Allow me to spread my seed and genes!
6058411	6061892	So that we'll be able to create the ultimate dancing person.
6062372	6063712	Who, yes, will not get laid.
6068974	6069254	Anyways.
6070959	6073321	So, not responding to this.
6073902	6074862	You know, actually I did.
6075022	6076984	I actually went in the thread and I responded.
6077685	6078505	I actually responded.
6079106	6080667	And here was my response down here.
6082669	6085211	Nah, I don't really want a girlfriend that plays DDR.
6085651	6087793	I think it would be cool to have a boyfriend that plays DDR though.
6090215	6091116	That was my response.
6091816	6092897	Angel, any feedback?
6094419	6095960	Well, considering...
6097021	6099923	Um, I'm going to have to switch this around.
6100883	6111128	Um, at one point I did, uh, want to find a guy to play DR, but, you know, that's kind of, I suppose it's kind of easy because it's all guys, but, hey, it kind of happened, so, you know.
6113469	6119533	Miraculously, yay, okay, um, so, whatever, you know.
6121053	6121494	Oh, gee.
6123114	6124675	Um, yeah, whatever.
6125536	6126296	Alright, so,
6128304	6129324	I don't know.
6129364	6131365	I'm trying to give this guy a little credit here.
6131445	6132425	He's probably young.
6134306	6137487	But we see these threads all over the freaking forum.
6137567	6138147	I know, I know.
6138187	6139228	But let me give you guys some advice.
6140288	6145990	People assume that they want to date somebody that has similar interests with them so that they can go out and do stuff together.
6146010	6146470	That's cool.
6146790	6152092	But remember, guys, your interests don't always have to match up 100% for a successful relationship.
6152132	6153933	In fact, I've been in relationships where
6154611	6156572	We weren't alike at all, okay?
6157012	6163713	Like, we were not even into the same types of things, but part of the relationship was learning about each other's interests.
6163813	6176577	And I think as long as your potential partner is open to the idea of, you know, hey, you play a dancing video game, you know, as long as maybe your potential partner watches a soap opera that you think is stupid.
6177139	6177899	but they watch it every day.
6177939	6180681	Well, you've got to be kind of open to that and kind of see it from their perspective.
6180741	6184542	Part about relationship is kind of learning from each other, I think.
6184602	6187083	You're never going to find anybody that's 100% just like you.
6187544	6190245	I know we all want to fuck ourselves, but let's face it.
6190265	6192066	I don't know about that, Scott.
6192106	6193986	That's sick.
6194086	6194647	Okay, I'm kidding.
6195247	6199729	But yeah, I mean, opposites attract and that's all I have to say.
6202053	6203234	Wouldn't you guys agree with me, though?
6203774	6204735	I totally agree.
6204755	6207777	Yeah, no problem.
6207817	6211439	You can settle your differences and make sure you understand each other in a way.
6213000	6215142	The main thing is communication, though.
6215182	6215842	We all know that.
6217543	6219465	That reminds me of that old Paula Abdul song.
6219685	6221846	Two steps forward, two steps back.
6221866	6223847	I don't remember that.
6224228	6230892	And I have no career and I'm on a stupid show that makes fun of people that suck.
6231738	6232338	She begs!
6232379	6233059	She begs!
6234360	6238123	God, Paula Abdul, so... Last century.
6244127	6245128	Yeah, anyways.
6246629	6247169	That's lame.
6247209	6248971	Why do people start threads like that, really?
6249851	6250952	Go talk to real people.
6252193	6254235	Stop using forums.
6256276	6260079	Why don't you stop wondering about girls and go discover what girls really are?
6261678	6267343	What if we didn't have that luxury of living in a somewhat big town and being able to go to the arcade and find people like us?
6267363	6271746	Because we all met, like it or not, we all met playing DDR, right?
6271946	6272667	That is true.
6272767	6275749	So, you know, maybe we've got a luxury this guy doesn't have.
6277151	6277471	Comment?
6279472	6280193	We're special.
6281334	6282975	I told you you were so talented.
6283916	6291262	And on top of that, you want to know, I actually met Dan online through anime and video games.
6292293	6294134	So you can find love on a forum.
6295134	6298915	No, I didn't know what the fuck a forum was when I first went online.
6298975	6300975	It was just someone my roommates knew.
6301235	6302736	I'll tell you how I found everything.
6302996	6304016	It's basically like this.
6304476	6312318	I was bored, so I read the manual for DDR, USA, or whatever, and in the back it gave special credits to DDRFreak.com.
6312918	6319880	Then in turn I went to DDRFreak.com, found that, found the regional forums, found the link to the Sacramento's webpage, joined their forums,
6320359	6322180	Found a meetup and then went there.
6323861	6325422	That's basically the whole chain of events.
6327784	6338230	So if I'm hearing this right, you're suggesting maybe what this guy ought to do is if he wants to find the girl that's into DDR, go to a meetup in your area where there are going to be people playing DDR, boys and girls.
6338630	6341872	And there's going to be 20 smelly guys all fighting over that one girl.
6342853	6346355	Yeah, I mean, go Friday night, Saturday night, or even into a tournament.
6347555	6349136	Exactly, go to your local tournament.
6349597	6349997	There you go.
6350467	6352268	If someone dares to even organize one.
6353169	6355590	So, it's hard to say because I don't know where this guy lives.
6357851	6358172	Alright.
6359312	6365676	Anyway, we're going to go to... I was going to say we're going to go to a break, but I think we're going to go to find out who won tonight's cage match.
6367257	6368738	Who do you guys think won tonight's cage match?
6370158	6372700	I think that Taku won with Holic.
6374241	6378463	Taku did get another few votes tonight for Holic, but unfortunately we throw those out and shred them.
6378523	6379604	Eventually he's going to win.
6380231	6381772	What do you guys think won?
6381852	6382692	Any guesses?
6382712	6390815	I'm guessing... Echo Image, maybe?
6391796	6396657	Yeah, I was going to guess Echo Image, even though Midi Head's pretty cool.
6397278	6399218	And Jamie's pick is also cool.
6400459	6402120	Yeah, I'm still going to guess Echo Image.
6403760	6408342	Alright, let's find out... What, Logie?
6409178	6409398	Nothing.
6409418	6410899	I was just quoting them all.
6410919	6418905	Imagine how it would be to be at the top making cash money to touring all around the world telling stories about young girls.
6421787	6422328	Right.
6422668	6422988	Alright.
6423349	6423769	Here it is.
6423849	6427552	Tonight's winner of the Orange Launch Radio Cage Match by one vote.
6428312	6431014	Only one vote made this song win.
6431034	6431715	It's always one vote.
6431735	6432035	Here it is.
6432075	6432716	By one vote...
6438579	6442121	There's a new champion, Echo Image with Endless Day.
6442881	6444442	One vote over Jolitaxi.
6444922	6448824	Why am I not surprised?
6448864	6450345	Very close vote, very close vote.
6450565	6454627	And MidiHead picked up quite a few votes of his own too, but one vote over Jolitaxi.
6454687	6456948	So if you think your vote doesn't make a difference, woohoo.
6457208	6458548	I already know what I'm going to pick.
6458568	6461030	The chatroom knows what I'm going to pick too.
6461050	6461990	I know what I'm going to pick.
6463564	6463984	Blue Impulse
6492435	6492936	Ali Shuttle
6598634	6599100	Thank you.
6631623	6633104	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6685712	6690513	I want your everything Every night I'll give you everything I want you I want you I want you
6796116	6796677	and many more.
6850929	6851972	Thanks for watching!
6905683	6906924	Orange Lounge Radio.
6907264	6909425	We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.
6914847	6922871	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening as we are usually here every Sunday night from 6.30pm to 9.30pm Pacific Standard Time.
6923131	6925092	I was being such a camera whore during the break too.
6925112	6925612	Did you see that?
6925692	6926793	I might get on the cam.
6927682	6929624	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6952702	6954883	I wanted to go to Fanime, but I want to cosplay this year.
6955223	6960085	So, you know, that would be a good way to... I'm thinking about making an idea I had a while back.
6960185	6962946	We should write the Fanime people and get one of those lecture things.
6963026	6964587	I want to make a white mage outfit.
6964927	6965727	That would be awesome.
6966688	6968228	That would be cool.
6968529	6969749	I'll go as a warrior.
6970069	6971330	I'll go as a warrior in Subligar.
6971350	6973731	I want to do the Yuna 10-2 white mage outfit.
6974671	6975331	Oh, now that's cool.
6975391	6976292	That one was really neat.
6976732	6977272	Those boots.
6978353	6981794	I definitely want to do the warrior in Subligar, though.
6984861	6985461	But, uh-huh?
6986082	6986522	When is what?
6987223	6990645	Uh, Fanime is usually... Loki, isn't Fanime usually around Memorial Day weekend?
6991406	6994248	Yeah, it was actually on Memorial Day weekend last year.
6995169	6999432	That's right, I remember Fanime was only like a week after E3 last year, and I was so tired.
6999592	7001053	We'll have to talk to the Fanime people, though.
7001153	7003255	Do you think we're good enough to get our own little lecture thing?
7003295	7004436	We are hot, okay?
7004496	7005316	We're hot shit!
7006297	7009400	Okay, honestly, honestly, they had Tanpopo Arcade there.
7010440	7011821	Do you remember what Tanpopo Arcade was?
7011841	7012382	Okay.
7012402	7012562	Okay.
7013686	7014346	Question answered.
7014406	7014667	Thanks.
7014807	7015407	All right, Angel.
7016087	7018349	I'll go if somebody wants to kidnap me for a weekend.
7018629	7019709	That sounded really bad.
7019870	7020130	Oops.
7021511	7024712	Fanime is May 27th, 28th, 29th, and 30th.
7026233	7030336	Now, I know, okay, everybody in the chat room is going, why Fanime?
7030376	7032257	Come to our local convention on the East Coast.
7032277	7033998	Because Anime Expo sucks.
7035639	7036699	It's not Fanime Expo.
7036719	7039221	Yeah, it's the fact that Fanime we can drive to.
7039301	7041282	Okay, we can all pile in the OLR van.
7041840	7070486	that doesn't exist except in my imagination but we can pile in the mystery machine which is the OLR van and go whereas to go to the east coast costs money that we don't have until we become rich and famous so we'll see that's what you can do E3 is the weekend before if you want to see us at your east coast con help us be rich and famous send us money E3 is the weekend before alright we'll see
7071212	7073194	We would love to come to more conventions, honestly.
7073254	7076376	We will whore ourselves out to anybody that wants to have us.
7077357	7078578	We could try Pacific Coast Con.
7078698	7080420	We'll even fly southwest.
7080940	7081961	I mean, we're not picky.
7082001	7083722	We'll fly southwest and stay in a Motel 6.
7085063	7088326	There's the one that the people who originally started AX do now.
7088346	7090808	I think it's like Pacific Coast Con or something.
7091709	7095131	That basically is back to what AX originally was before it got stupid.
7097153	7098454	And here's a pretty good con.
7098634	7099795	We could do Yowie Con.
7100296	7100656	Hot.
7100676	7100736	Hot.
7101494	7106201	Oh my god, we should do YaoiCon and go all like, like, J-Rock style.
7106662	7109506	You just made me blink and run away, but maybe that's a good thing.
7110788	7111989	YaoiCon's supposed to be fun.
7112070	7113552	Loki, wouldn't you want to do YaoiCon?
7114894	7116396	Oh yeah, look at me all excited.
7119815	7123797	Alright, I think what we'll do now is actually we're going to open up our Skype line for some feedback.
7123837	7126219	If you guys want to call our show, we're going to do that.
7126279	7130801	So we're going to open up the Skype line right now for you guys to be able to call into our show and have a chat with us.
7131742	7134624	Jamie, in the meantime, I know you wanted to talk about something that's going on.
7134664	7139767	We were talking about LiveJournal a little bit before, and I know you've got a new little project going on over there, so go ahead and plug away.
7140367	7146110	Over on LiveJournal, I've made a community called GeekFit, G-E-E-K-S-I-T.
7146671	7148992	For anybody who was wanting to
7149562	7152105	Have feedback on getting in better shape.
7153107	7162538	There's a few of us on there right now, basically just like a big support group for each other, sharing tips, asking about exercise, different things that are helping all of us.
7162639	7167404	So if you're interested in bettering yourself, then join up.
7167665	7168386	That's what we're for.
7170816	7171837	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7191121	7191782	DDRs and Means for Exercise
7211385	7217788	Now, there's more to, though, you wouldn't, you know, somebody wants to join this community and talk about how DDR is their exercise program.
7217808	7223210	That's cool and all, but what are some other alternatives that you guys would be encouraging over in the GeekFit community?
7225031	7229533	Well, it's more or less just leaning more toward healthy attitudes.
7230494	7239718	You know, we would encourage, like, if you say, okay, if I need to play how much DDR to lose how much, then, you know, we've been sharing in there, like,
7240091	7243933	Like our last thing that we put in there was different snacks.
7245294	7249696	And about at least three people on the community now are doing low carb diets.
7249737	7252038	We have other people who are highly active.
7252818	7255420	And then, you know, there's my high protein thing that I'm doing.
7255460	7262524	But mostly we just support each other's style of how we're doing it and give feedback.
7263713	7265554	I'm going to follow up with you in a minute here.
7265614	7270837	I actually just picked up a call on the Skype line here because I want to actually pick up a call while we've got somebody on the line.
7271117	7272138	Hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio.
7272158	7272498	Who dis?
7273498	7273778	Hello?
7274059	7274339	Hello.
7275339	7275920	This is Jaded.
7276280	7276880	Hi, Jaded.
7276920	7277320	How are you?
7277340	7278481	I'm doing fine.
7278581	7278961	Yourself?
7279281	7279581	Good.
7279681	7281663	Now, this is the first time you've called into the show, isn't it?
7282223	7282703	Yes, it is.
7282863	7283864	Fresh blood.
7287966	7289387	Any comment you want to make about tonight's show?
7289427	7290107	Any comment in general?
7290922	7293503	Yes, actually, we were tired.
7295403	7296584	I just lost you there, bud.
7297704	7299425	You might have some bandwidth going there.
7299445	7300385	You got bandwidth issues.
7300405	7303466	You might want to stop anything else you're doing, even if you're listening to the show.
7304506	7304946	Can you hear me?
7307727	7308668	I think we might have lost him.
7308908	7309528	Can you hear me, guy?
7309688	7309948	Pardon me?
7310410	7310930	Okay, there you are.
7311851	7314372	Your bandwidth, you're really choppy right now.
7314852	7315632	You got a comment for us?
7316853	7319594	Because my bandwidth is not being used at the time.
7320194	7322235	Ooh, just must be a shoddy connection.
7322395	7323055	I don't know.
7323075	7325296	Okay, try it now.
7326977	7327497	A little better.
7327517	7330018	I was noticing it, to tell you the truth.
7330419	7332700	Okay, what was the comment you wanted to make?
7332720	7333820	We'll try to pick it up as best we can.
7334820	7337962	Okay, the comment I wanted to make was about meeting the...
7338760	7339781	Oh, our crew, actually.
7339801	7343203	The comment was, basically, that would pay, like, a great random prize, so to speak.
7343223	7343624	Yeah, basically.
7343644	7347046	Kind of more or less as, like, a game show, so to speak.
7347066	7348908	Kind of like the first date.
7364332	7374440	So, okay, he's breaking up a little bit, but as I understand what he's suggesting here is that we should do some type of game show, and the big prize would be fly out here and meet the OLR crew.
7375541	7376662	I don't know about that.
7376742	7381005	I mean, my God, that means one of us would have to put this person up and everything.
7381025	7384228	It would be a little weird, but I like the idea.
7385249	7388672	It just involves money, which is non-existent in our budget.
7389192	7391274	How much was in the budget this year, DarkSakura?
7391314	7392835	How much did we have in the Orange Launch Radio budget?
7393667	7394968	and some sun-dried tomatoes.
7395008	7399292	Yeah, I believe we had some sun-dried tomatoes and about five jelly bellies in this year's budget.
7399512	7400693	I contributed cashews, though.
7401073	7402174	You did, so that was good.
7403615	7407478	Hopefully we can sell that stuff on eBay and we'd be able to have this contest.
7407558	7408299	I like the idea.
7409160	7410260	I just don't know if we can do it.
7410861	7411902	Would you enter if we did it?
7412562	7413103	Yeah, I would.
7413403	7417366	Now, you're not one of those freaky stalkers that has an axe that would chop us up or anything, are you?
7417606	7418107	Oh, no.
7418267	7418527	Okay.
7419108	7419388	All right.
7420389	7420829	Sounds good.
7420929	7422170	All right, any other comment you want to make?
7423450	7427052	And then, no, that's the only comment I really wanted to make.
7427132	7428573	Alright, well, I like the idea, Jaded.
7428613	7430774	I hope one day we're rich and we can make it work for you guys.
7432174	7432455	Okay.
7432515	7433335	Alright, have a good one, buddy.
7433635	7433875	Yep.
7434095	7434496	Alright, bye.
7435276	7436196	We like new people calling in.
7436216	7437897	Alright, if you want to call in, Skype line's open.
7437937	7438498	Give us a call there.
7438878	7441359	Jamie actually is over on the cam right now.
7441499	7441919	Gasp.
7442640	7443620	Shock and awe.
7444100	7448342	www.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to head over there and look.
7450063	7451324	You know, actually...
7452490	7465716	This is what would be a good idea, is that instead of flying somebody out here necessarily to hang out in our studio house and everything like that, maybe if we were to do the Fateme thing or the E3 thing, we could actually have a Come With Us to E3 contest.
7466076	7467157	How cool would that be?
7467957	7471018	People would be murdering each other to do that, so I don't know.
7472439	7472979	We'll see.
7473159	7474860	One day we'll make one of these ideas work.
7474920	7478161	Anyway, we've got another call on the Orange Launch Radio Skype line, so let's have a chat.
7478342	7479282	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
7479893	7480333	Oh, that's hot.
7480373	7480753	Keep talking.
7480773	7481713	There are going to be...
7508411	7518176	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7531519	7532140	Here's another thing.
7532640	7535283	Seven new CS songs which are going to be exclusives.
7536364	7539467	Including songs from L.E.D., Garoovy, and Megumi Over Slope.
7540088	7543131	So surprise, we're seeing a lot of the same people that were in 8th style coming back.
7543171	7543811	But that's a good thing.
7544332	7545033	New L.E.D.
7545413	7546174	is always a good thing.
7546474	7550258	If Meg wants to do another video where she shows off her rack, fine by me.
7551368	7552129	Yeah, I heard that.
7552169	7552969	Yeah!
7553270	7554070	Take it off!
7555591	7561174	And then the last one here is a remix version of the popular song Usual Days from Poppin' Music.
7561234	7562996	It's going to be on Nonstyle CS.
7563236	7565217	Ooh, okay, so we're getting a Poppin' Music remix.
7565737	7570900	Now, wasn't there another song in 8th style that was crossed over from Poppin' Music as well?
7571421	7573402	Oh, that's Everyday Lonely Day by Rosanna.
7573742	7574223	Okay, yeah.
7574603	7576424	And I love that song, so hopefully that's a good sign.
7578664	7579205	All right, cool.
7579265	7580986	Any other details on 9th style we know so far?
7581586	7585309	That's the last thing there was on the message.
7585570	7586791	Okay, very cool.
7586871	7589233	So I need to get back into 2DX.
7589273	7590093	I'm so far behind.
7590133	7591655	I have to pick up 7th, 8th, and 9th style.
7591675	7596118	But 9th style, seriously, is like my favorite song list since like 6th.
7596318	7597639	So I have to have to get it.
7598160	7599881	So one of these days.
7601903	7603324	Any other news going on out there?
7604076	7606257	Well, this is the only one I've brought so far.
7606557	7607397	Alright, well, fair enough.
7607477	7608638	I'll let you know.
7608938	7609898	Any quick comments you want to make?
7610579	7612139	Well, yeah.
7612960	7616021	The site that I gave you, I mean, the Dust Bacon site I gave you.
7616161	7618082	Dust Bacon, which... Yeah.
7619122	7620563	Just check it out after the show.
7622164	7623904	I will have... It has a lot of videos in it.
7624405	7627566	I have to zoom out to the goth club so I can look miserable tonight?
7627986	7630867	Well, probably after the goth club or something.
7631047	7631488	Anytime.
7631668	7632488	I will make that happen.
7634809	7635089	All right.
7635750	7636590	Thanks for calling, my friend.
7636610	7637170	I appreciate it.
7637771	7638311	Have a good one, bud.
7638651	7639031	No problem.
7639151	7639592	Bye-bye.
7640612	7641192	And look at that.
7641233	7642773	We're getting back-to-back phone calls tonight.
7643294	7644594	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7645455	7646055	Hey, Sky.
7646115	7646795	It's El Mullet.
7646875	7647796	Hello, El Mullet.
7647816	7648616	How are you, my friend?
7649177	7650257	I am doing good, Sky.
7650297	7651017	How about yourself?
7651178	7651658	I'm good.
7651698	7654399	I'm very happy that lots of people are interacting with the show tonight.
7654459	7655480	This is making me very happy.
7655720	7658641	And you were sitting on hold there for quite a while, so I appreciate your patience.
7659122	7659722	Yeah, no problem.
7659742	7661143	Somebody beat you to the punch a little earlier.
7661183	7661763	What's new, buddy?
7663611	7664391	Not much new.
7665272	7668592	Took it to the ITG guy, like I said I was going to do last week.
7668793	7669713	Ah, yes, I remember this.
7669733	7673614	You were having it out with the ITG guy in your column over on Inside Pulse.
7674154	7674834	Yes, I was.
7675114	7677895	Any feedback from that so far?
7678555	7690838	Well, not direct feedback, except actually one person directly replied to the column on the site saying that he tried In The Groove and wasn't too impressed.
7690878	7692419	He said it didn't have the
7693157	7694999	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7719833	7725558	All that has happened now is one appears in my area so I can try it for myself so I can develop an opinion on it.
7725838	7729161	Or you win the Come to Orange Lounge radio contest.
7730342	7735026	At this rate, we're going to save our jelly bellies and that contest will be happening in 2008.
7737067	7737608	So we'll see.
7738629	7744354	Hopefully, if I can ever get a boatload of money, the first thing I'm going to do with it is to fly out and see you guys.
7744454	7746015	Well, now you've got a wedding coming up, right?
7746693	7747614	Yes, I got a wedding coming up.
7747634	7749757	You gotta spend it on the missus first, but then us.
7749777	7750077	Yes, I do.
7750317	7750858	Yes, I do.
7751178	7751559	But then us.
7751579	7753861	We're talking, like, lots of money.
7754062	7757746	Ooh, hey, this makes me think of a topic we were just talking about earlier.
7757846	7760349	Does your girlfriend, or your fiancé, does she end a DDR?
7762209	7763390	She knows I play it.
7764650	7770133	She's not too into it because she can't play very well.
7770353	7772494	Something's wrong with her leg.
7772814	7779697	She can walk normally, but she's had some surgeries in the past and she can't necessarily play.
7779817	7781898	I know folks like that and they just have a hard time playing.
7782799	7799041	Actually, RicePrincess, I don't think she has a problem with me saying this, RicePrincess actually doesn't play a whole lot of DDR because she had surgery on her leg some time ago, and it causes her not to be able to, I mean, she can play it, but she can't play it as intensively as most of the addicts do, if you know what I mean.
7800607	7807312	I tried getting her into it when we first started going out and nothing doing, so I said, okay, you got your opinion, that's fine.
7807652	7808913	I did get her into Pokemon, though.
7809493	7810974	Well, there you go.
7811315	7814437	See, but even though she's not into DDR, it worked, right?
7815077	7815538	Definitely.
7815578	7815998	Definitely.
7816098	7822983	And is there anything that your girlfriend did that maybe at first you were like, okay, I gotta learn how to like that, or...
7825963	7828605	Well, nothing I can think of on the top of my head.
7828685	7829565	It's probably for the best.
7829625	7830526	Keeps you out of trouble that way.
7832307	7833648	Yeah.
7833708	7836849	Any other stuff going on at Inside Pulse this week we should be aware of?
7840691	7842572	I think we have something new coming up.
7845714	7849056	Sometime in the future we're going to have a Shining Force feature pop up.
7850357	7851177	And what is that all about?
7852695	7855217	There's an RPG series, The Shining Force.
7876952	7879134	Nothing like shamelessly shilling my own site.
7879274	7880595	Yeah, nothing like it.
7880655	7884058	That's why people call into this show, really, is to whore out their own projects, honestly.
7884098	7884559	But that's all right.
7884619	7884959	We don't mind.
7885640	7886740	Come to my website.
7888482	7889363	Anything else you want to share?
7889403	7891344	Any comments on what we talked about in the show?
7891364	7896549	Actually, I've got to get going real quick.
7896749	7897029	Okay.
7897290	7898330	Well, that's fair by me.
7898390	7898611	All right.
7898631	7899491	Have a good one, bud.
7899531	7900032	Thanks for calling.
7900192	7900432	All right.
7900873	7901133	Later.
7903295	7903655	All right.
7906224	7910747	You've been playing over there on the webcam like crazy, haven't you, DarkSakura?
7912028	7915871	All of a sudden I saw in the chatroom somebody had posted, Jamie's hot!
7918553	7919594	Look at that, I see it right there.
7919694	7921776	Jamie is so hot, says Dark Knight.
7924518	7927080	Jamie's selling it on the webcam tonight, awesome.
7929362	7934766	Fine, put my magnets on the cam, but don't F up the TV with the magnetic fields and all that stuff, that would make me cry.
7937196	7946926	Alright, let's see, we have the Skype line still open, if you guys want to call in, we'll keep it open a few more minutes for you guys, just in case you want to call in there.
7949269	7952792	Trying to think of what else is going on in the scene right now, there's really, oh, Angel, you have a comment?
7954874	7955335	Getting up there?
7956284	7961205	Um, I don't know, well actually it's something that all of us can make fun of because, oops.
7962565	7967346	Okay, um, AIM, or AOL Instant Messenger came up with it.
7967406	7969667	Okay, wait, hold this thought because I'm going to go off on this for a little bit.
7969687	7970367	I know where you're going.
7970407	7971767	I want to talk about this in detail a little bit.
7972167	7972967	Okay, never mind.
7973248	7974248	Um, you didn't hear anything.
7974308	7975988	Yeah, raise it from your minds.
7976688	7979249	This is what we get for not preparing this show in advance, so that's fine.
7979969	7982029	You've dealt with that for years, you'll continue to love us.
7982609	7983930	Uh, we're going to go to the Skype line.
7983950	7985030	Hi, you're on Orange Lines Radio.
7985916	7989440	This is Dark Knight with a shameless plug to get OLR on the East Coast.
8002276	8002797	and what the hell.
8002997	8003597	Sure, go for it.
8003918	8008061	I don't know if that project ended up taking off or what, but I guess not, because I haven't heard anything else about it.
8008662	8009983	OLR East Coast.
8010043	8011564	You know, I'd love it.
8011644	8016969	If it was in the budget of jelly beans and cashews, I would do it, but you know... And the sun-dried tomatoes.
8017029	8018710	Sorry, and the sun-dried tomatoes.
8018750	8019451	I can't forget about that.
8019511	8020412	It's a good third of the budget.
8020632	8023935	I think that we had a vote to up our budget to add spinach, too.
8024155	8024535	We'll see.
8025116	8025496	You know what?
8025836	8027678	We're going to have to fire somebody to add the spinach.
8028218	8029158	Sorry, Angel.
8032159	8033939	We need spinach more than an archive.
8034039	8040300	Alright, Dark Knight, if we were to come out to the East Coast as Orange Lounge Radio, what would we do?
8040400	8044381	Where would we be doing our show from, and what kinds of stuff would we report on, do you think?
8046061	8050022	Let's see, I would probably have y'all in New York, in the middle of nowhere.
8050202	8051202	Very fine, very fine.
8053603	8054423	Covering in the groove.
8056327	8057567	Oh no, that's it.
8058207	8059748	This project's cancelled.
8060528	8061168	No, I'm kidding.
8061328	8062128	I'm kidding.
8062748	8070690	I would do a show live from 8 on the break with my ass planted on the up arrow of the in the groove machine if we had the money for it.
8071090	8071410	Okay?
8071910	8075190	And Jamie could have her ass planted on the down arrow on the two player side.
8075210	8075670	And Loki?
8076691	8077251	I don't know about him.
8078191	8081051	Maybe flipping it off or taking a piss on the back of it or something.
8081732	8084192	Since I hardly ever get to do this, hi Dark Knight.
8084881	8087822	Because you know me and my public urination.
8087842	8093463	Oh, I think I just started to piss Dane again.
8094004	8095124	No, no, don't go there, buddy.
8095184	8095944	Don't go there.
8096044	8098125	Loki could be on the Parapara machine.
8098305	8099585	That's a little ways down.
8099625	8102266	And he could be doing his white freestyle on that.
8104255	8105096	Yeah, if you say so.
8105116	8108840	But like I said, give OLR money so you can bring them to the East Coast.
8109040	8109520	I like that.
8109560	8110161	That is all.
8110341	8112203	I like that give OLR money idea.
8112463	8116788	In fact, people have been telling us we should open up a PayPal thing for the longest time, a give OLR money thing.
8117328	8121252	We do have the unofficial give OLR money thing.
8121492	8124976	You can PayPal to nightmare underscore hunter at yahoo.com.
8126637	8128338	Any amount of money is fine.
8128778	8132580	All that money will not be going to Tsunami Relief.
8132740	8136761	But you can give it to me, and I might.
8138082	8139962	If the price is right, I might.
8140803	8141303	No, I won't.
8142902	8144903	No, no, that is not the give OLR money.
8145003	8148044	That is make Loki's porn collection bigger fund, okay?
8148084	8150505	That is all you're going to do is make it... Buy porn?
8150545	8151286	Who buys porn?
8151306	8157068	Send to jamie at orangedownradio.com your links to your PayPal accounts and passwords.
8159329	8173881	and the money will be well used to fund my let's go visit everybody and not go to work yeah right the pay our rent we'll have the Orange Lounge RV how about that
8174511	8176533	Dude, we'd be like the freaking Partridge family.
8176573	8177874	That'd be rad.
8177934	8179135	Maybe we'd get our own cult.
8179295	8189384	If we could wing it, if we had the money and we could all get like a week off of work, I would pile us all in a van and we'd drive around the country for a week.
8189664	8193788	My work only gives leave of absence in increments of 30 days, so hey, that works for me.
8194008	8195669	Do I get to come or am I still fired?
8197771	8199873	It depends if the spinach can come or not.
8200714	8200914	No.
8201789	8204171	Spinach would probably be consumed, so I guess you can come.
8204471	8206714	I like spinach, so, yeah.
8208475	8209596	What can I say, Dark Knight?
8209676	8210477	I love the idea.
8210577	8218765	I'd love to do the East Coast and talk about DDR out there, the whole scene out there, but until we have the money, we rely on you guys to report on the East Coast scene for us.
8218785	8219485	You can give us money.
8219825	8220466	It's all good.
8220826	8222668	So what is going on on the East Coast scene right now?
8222748	8224630	What's so freaking great about In The Groove, anyway?
8225871	8229874	Well, actually, I'm in Richmond, so we'll never see you in the groove, knock on wood.
8230494	8230794	Uh-huh.
8231475	8233136	Well, what else is going on on the East Coast, then?
8234117	8235298	Nothing much right now.
8235318	8238440	I'm still kind of griping over the fact that we no longer have 2DX.
8239220	8240301	Oh, what happened?
8241302	8246565	The machine wasn't taken care of, so they basically, the people up there called it a dead weight and got rid of it.
8247586	8248507	Oh, that sucks.
8249508	8253630	I think the last thing they did was put an upgrade in this machine to a V3, and that was it.
8253871	8254191	Woo-hoo!
8254864	8283672	you know we had a very similar sob story in Sacramento R8 style dead, gone, finally mailed away it's sad but you know the machine it's in a better place now it's in a better place now alright we're gonna let you go buddy we're gonna go to break have a good one though thanks for calling in later we heard from a lot of people tonight that was good thank you guys for calling in and making the show interesting because lord knows we're not good at it just kidding
8284820	8290045	We're going to go to another break, and in this break, let's do some US DDR music, why not?
8290785	8295909	And I know if I don't start it off with this song, that Jamie will kill me.
8297251	8298391	We can't have that, can we?
8298411	8303836	We cannot, so we'll be back after this with more Orange Launch Radio and the FUs of the week, coming up.
8319401	8322462	It's got to be forever, the green grass blows and the wind is dancing

8620606	8622307	Thanks for watching!
8702543	8703504	Gaming Radio.
8703744	8708707	So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
8711189	8712530	Orange Lounge Radio.
8715752	8725998	You know, honestly, guys, that is what I absolutely love about this show is that, you know, we're supposedly about video games and DR and all that nerdy stuff, but man, when Tom Brokaw says cunt, that's funny.
8727299	8728540	And we have to talk about it.
8732285	8733427	Skyblind's open again.
8733447	8736712	A few of you folks in the chatroom requested that we open it back up, so fine.
8737093	8738375	We're opening it up for a little window.
8738475	8741380	It's open right now, so you guys can call in right now.
8741560	8742842	Only for a couple minutes, though.
8743924	8745406	Then we're going to go on to bigger and better things.
8745899	8750542	Also, that you have to be in our chat room to send in your FUs of the week.
8750942	8752002	We're going to get into that segment.
8752043	8757526	Please, though, we do have a lot of folks listening tonight, and explicit's here, which means it's going to go long anyway.
8757886	8762388	So please, if you would, try to keep your FUs of the week short, and we'll get to those in a minute.
8762428	8763589	All right, we've got a call on the Skype line.
8763629	8764169	Let's go to it.
8764229	8765410	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8768011	8770133	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8772354	8772454	Hello.
8773686	8775327	I hear stuff moving around, but I don't hear you guys.
8775587	8775867	Hello?
8776467	8777587	It's Static Man.
8777627	8778188	It's Static.
8778808	8779608	It's Static Man.
8779848	8781649	If you can hear us, we cannot hear you.
8781749	8784170	Make sure your microphone is turned on.
8785470	8786210	Ah, we got the hang up.
8786410	8786831	Dough.
8787791	8788091	Bummer.
8788631	8789312	Live radio, guys.
8789332	8789732	What can you do?
8789972	8790432	No phone screen.
8790772	8792713	It's not in the budget for a phone screener, either.
8792773	8795194	We had to cut that out to make way for the jelly beans.
8795734	8797534	So, what can we do?
8797554	8798755	All right.
8798795	8799135	All right.
8800595	8802216	Well, we'll try it again a little later.
8802256	8804056	We'll try opening up the Skype line again a little later.
8804116	8806077	But for now, I want to move into another topic.
8806697	8809138	Angel, you were mentioning this and then I cut you off.
8809178	8810118	I'm so sorry, but please.
8810778	8811418	What's going on, Angel?
8813299	8816280	I found something that we could actually make fun of if we wanted to.
8816900	8822562	I was talking to Sky on AIM earlier, just chatting it up, and then I saw a little link that...
8823956	8846575	It was something about an AOL Instant Messenger game, but it had something to do with dancing and I was kind of intrigued to click on it, but then I didn't want to because it was going to charge me money after a certain amount of songs and whatever, but I was almost tempted just to see how crappy it was going to be or good or however, but if it has to do with aim, usually it's crappy, right?
8848257	8849018	Well, we will see.
8849118	8862107	So I investigated a little bit here, and sure enough, there is this new game that's showing up on AOL, on the Instant Messenger, in the games portion, called Groovomatic is the name of this game.
8862167	8866150	It's Groovomatic, and I'm actually downloading it and installing it right now.
8866190	8869433	So if you're hearing a couple skips and things like that, I apologize.
8869493	8871334	We're just moving in here.
8872075	8874877	So let's go ahead and see if we can't...
8877111	8879133	Get in this Groovomatic game.
8879394	8881176	Now, Angel, you actually didn't check this out yet?
8882597	8888583	All I know is that you get one character and ten songs for free, and then you have to pay after that, I believe.
8889004	8890486	That's all I know about it.
8891507	8894530	But we'll see in about a few minutes if it's any good or not.
8895894	8900476	Now, this is a game made by Wild Tangent, which I know AdAware recognizes.
8900496	8901696	This is an ad bot.
8901976	8910019	So I have just installed an ad bot on my computer for you people, so you better appreciate this sneak preview of Groove-O-Matic.
8910040	8914141	Okay, so I'm going to go into single player mode here, and we're going to go into Groove-O-Matic.
8914161	8916722	I just want to hear what kind of songs this Groove-O-Matic game has.
8917762	8918363	Let's see here.
8919703	8921584	Oh, yes, it's saying Wild Tangent.
8922335	8924317	This is the company that made this game.
8924597	8925558	Groovy little songs there.
8925618	8926699	Oh, we're going full screen.
8929942	8930342	Let's see.
8930402	8932644	I'm going to do this dance to the beat option.
8934305	8934766	Oh, look at that.
8934806	8935907	You get little characters.
8938649	8942212	There's a mama on the right side there with big chichis.
8942452	8943893	Her character's got some chichis there.
8944994	8945975	It's her name's Janet.
8947336	8947877	And now I can...
8948809	8951671	Okay, there's only one song I can play in this mini version.
8951711	8952971	It's called La Fiesta.
8952991	8954472	You guys ready to see La Fiesta?
8956493	8956753	Alright.
8957154	8958194	Yeah, they should be able to hear this.
8959475	8960515	Okay, so I'm going to play the song.
8960535	8961176	Let's see what happens.
8965718	8966839	Oh, is this like Bust-a-Move?
8967639	8968780	It's kind of set up like it.
8969080	8969700	Let's see what happens.
8971241	8972542	Loki, run commentary while I play.
8974043	8976544	This is, um, interesting for me.
8981665	8982426	It's Bustamove!
8992717	8994779	This game is just like Bustamove.
8994859	8995960	This isn't DDR at all.
8996981	8997441	It's what?
9002647	9004729	This song is really hot, by the way.
9006641	9007642	Okay, wait, I'm going to back out.
9007722	9008462	Okay, I hit escape.
9008763	9014727	Because there's actually, it looks like there's a mode in there that is something about freestyle.
9014807	9017148	Like you can play with your own MP3s.
9017669	9018509	So I'm going to do that mode.
9018529	9019310	Let's see if I can do it.
9021512	9022392	Little goody, I can.
9025714	9026555	Let's see if I can find it.
9028036	9030178	What would be a good song to dance to in freestyle mode?
9030458	9031679	No, we're not going to do girls.
9035621	9036262	I want to do something...
9037751	9038431	I'm using here.
9040573	9041153	It doesn't want to work.
9041233	9041693	Oh, shoot.
9041753	9043334	Okay, well, hopefully I have something in this folder.
9044835	9045896	Ooh, it's glitching out on me.
9046156	9046456	Yikes.
9048197	9051659	I'm already getting really bad glitches here.
9051699	9052180	Okay, there we go.
9052220	9052880	It fixed itself.
9054761	9055181	Let's see.
9055261	9056402	What's a song I can do here?
9061005	9061625	Sorry, guys.
9062766	9063326	Okay, here we go.
9063346	9066208	We're going to do this song.
9067574	9068394	Let's see how this works.
9070955	9074656	Okay, so it's loading the song I just picked right now, and let's see how this plays.
9081259	9082239	Loki, commentary please.
9083279	9084520	Same shitty game still.
9089201	9090042	Same background.
9094523	9095263	And wow, this rocks.
9098934	9101596	and it's just sitting there doing nothing.
9102136	9103617	They're just dancing back and forth.
9103637	9103977	Here we go.
9104397	9105138	Now it's like DDR.
9107399	9108239	This is DDR.
9111001	9112482	This is exactly DDR.
9112802	9114083	Wow, we ripped off DDR.
9118185	9120046	What the hell is that chick doing on the side?
9121167	9122207	Why is she getting naked?
9122407	9126990	I like this game, but why... What the hell?
9127605	9129526	This is like the guy game, but not.
9130126	9133148	It's not even playing the damn MP3 I told it to play.
9133628	9134208	That's hokey.
9135989	9137390	Okay, what can we say?
9137570	9139791	That was interesting, to say the least.
9139831	9140792	That was retarded.
9141432	9144734	But it had Buster Groove and DDR stuff in it.
9144814	9145614	That's kind of weird.
9145714	9147035	That blows.
9147135	9148996	It stole ideas from two games there.
9149036	9149736	What's that about?
9150877	9152478	That blows hard.
9152798	9156720	Alright, well, I can't believe we're going to advertise this game that we just did there.
9157501	9165445	If you want to check this out for yourself, open up AOL Instant Messenger and look on your games panel because it's right there waiting for you to play.
9165585	9167105	So, have at it, people.
9167626	9169546	And I'm sorry we were not able to put that on the cam.
9169867	9173728	We'll try to do that next week for you guys because we have to actually load it on a different computer to do that.
9173768	9176790	And that would involve putting spyware on Loki's computer.
9178330	9178610	Alright.
9180691	9181091	Thank you.
9181252	9184413	Thank you so much for bringing this show down with that crappy game, Angel.
9184853	9186214	I knew it was going to be a crappy game.
9186294	9186874	I just thought it was
9190572	9195793	To that game's credit, it's not as bad as some of the knockoff games I've seen out there available for download.
9195813	9198733	What was that one that had all the classical music in MIDI format?
9198773	9199913	It was by, like, GameHouse or something?
9200213	9201554	It was Tapajam, wasn't it?
9201834	9202514	Tapajam.
9202634	9203774	That game's... oh, boy.
9204914	9206015	Oh, that game was bad.
9206035	9208695	That was a bad game.
9214981	9218424	Alright, we are going to go into the FUs of the week.
9219245	9220005	It's that time.
9220586	9221367	Are you guys ready?
9221907	9225110	Jamie, why is it that we have to do the FUs of the week every single week?
9225550	9227732	Because we're not going to take it anymore.
9234858	9236099	Oh, this is bad.
9236119	9237781	Here is justice.
9237881	9238882	Here is punishment.
9238902	9239102	Here.
9239142	9240303	This is fucked up.
9243863	9251006	A big F you goes, of course, to the usual traffic, fog, sunny skies that get in my eyes.
9254067	9260089	Really, I think it had to do with just being sick when I was out in the Bay Area on Friday.
9260629	9266291	And also a big F you to not being able to purchase Twinbee for the Game Boy Advance because Network had it.
9266798	9273323	and a big F you to Nintendo for giving them better packaging in Japan because the old releases are really awesome looking.
9273343	9276246	They come in very tiny versions of the original boxes.
9279268	9282451	Another F you goes toward time-distance lack of money.
9284473	9285954	School's starting next week.
9287795	9292960	Really, this is not a whole bunch I'm overly angsty about immediately.
9293980	9294281	Shock.
9296531	9305416	Oh, yeah, and, uh, and FU to, uh... Oh, not being able to install certain games on my system yet.
9305936	9310358	And Gravity for being assholes, and Ragnarok Online 2 for not being out yet.
9311479	9311959	That's it.
9312820	9314280	Oh, and the scale at the damn gym.
9315801	9316161	Oh, dear.
9316321	9316662	All right.
9317442	9318022	Moving on.
9318543	9319523	Loki, your turn.
9321844	9324666	I'm... I'm getting tired now.
9324786	9324906	Um...
9326035	9329358	The only F you of the week goes to me for being stupid and making a dumb mistake.
9330419	9331680	So, yeah.
9332421	9340868	And, um... Fuck you to, um, actually... To Tahoe Joes for ruining mashed potatoes.
9341228	9344171	They single-handedly ruined something that's so simple...
9345026	9347727	F you to the lack of angst in the room tonight.
9347827	9349048	What is up with that?
9375935	9376255	I don't know.
9376435	9376755	You know what?
9377115	9380618	I hate to be on the same page, but I really have a lot of the same FUs.
9381178	9383300	FU to difficult situations.
9383400	9390305	Like, I just... I kind of... Like, there was like a... Somebody proposed something to me.
9390325	9391766	This is going to sound dirty, but it's not.
9391806	9392226	I swear to God.
9392586	9395548	Somebody kind of proposed something interesting out there.
9395649	9397490	Like, and it has to do with my professional career.
9397850	9399111	I got an interesting proposal.
9399611	9401513	And I'm really torn.
9401673	9402393	I don't know what to do.
9402634	9404355	So, I'm just going to kind of put my...
9405169	9405870	I'm not saying anything.
9405890	9405970	Fine.
9435197	9436978	Oh, actually, if I can sneak something in.
9437078	9437338	Sure.
9437899	9440220	F you to my voice for deciding it doesn't want to work.
9441841	9442241	All right.
9443502	9446484	Let's go on and move on with the rest of the FUs of the week.
9447945	9450346	I'm going to regret this, but let's start with Explicit.
9450646	9451006	Okay.
9451427	9452287	I'd like to ask you a question.
9452307	9454629	Did any of my FUs get to the last week?
9455289	9457450	I don't even remember what we touched on last week.
9457490	9458671	Last week was last week.
9460455	9466336	I think I cut out most of your FUs that dealt with people in particular because we don't like those types of FUs.
9466576	9469777	So I'd ask that you just try to pass those ones up.
9470637	9472577	I don't remember which ones you can say.
9472778	9473258	I don't remember.
9473398	9475778	Just what's new this week that pissed you off?
9476098	9477098	Three hour show, buddy.
9478979	9479359	All right.
9480359	9485120	FU for having a third crack in my fucking window over debris over a freaking storm again.
9486147	9489848	God, three cracks in a window off in one whole month.
9489868	9492129	Ain't that a fucking bitch.
9493589	9496049	F you for school for starting next week.
9497170	9499450	There goes packing up some of the books again.
9501151	9505472	F you with everybody trying to make my tournament a joke again with the piss.
9506514	9507254	It's funny.
9507674	9508175	Come on.
9511395	9511996	It's not a joke.
9512056	9514116	It's just a tournament, just like everything else.
9514216	9518257	It's not something to take a piss on or whatever.
9518277	9521218	And if YouTube people...
9524219	9528361	who wants to start drama privately and sending their private messages to me privately.
9529162	9534645	Just because you don't like somebody in this tournament does not mean you guys are not going to get along.
9535085	9535826	Get over it.
9537247	9538387	Wait till the tournament comes in.
9538607	9539268	That's all it is.
9540208	9547573	If it comes to people begging for the freaking song list for the tournament, goddammit, I told you the list is going to be 16 songs.
9549747	9550347	That is all.
9550607	9551147	Nothing else.
9551287	9552648	I will not reveal it to the tournament.
9553368	9554268	I said on the rules.
9555208	9555869	Just deal with it.
9556749	9561550	Next person who... Next person who mentions this in private will be banned from my tournament.
9562230	9562730	Seriously.
9562750	9569492	I'm getting a headache with all these people trying to complain and bitch about certain things that should not be bitched about.
9572888	9579678	And then Effie goes to a stroke that my grandmother just recently had.
9581520	9582642	It's pretty depressing.
9583663	9588069	I didn't really want to say this in the Effies, but yeah, strokes suck.
9590532	9591053	And F.E.
9591093	9595658	goes from misplanned, from plans being all mixed up on Friday.
9596279	9605490	I was supposed to go to, I was supposedly supposed to go to Canada's freestyle meetup, but things got mixed up so I had to go to Reno with a few people.
9606010	9608333	So that was planned earlier before the meetup.
9610715	9619098	and Effie goes from the same people who are complaining about the religious issue over some games or censorship issues.
9619758	9634823	Just because something has explicit content or whatever or they think it's offensive like a puppet of Maria from Banya think it's too religiously offensive is a reason why the puppet was removed from the Paradise Island.
9635310	9636571	You have got to be kidding me.
9636971	9638191	I shit you not.
9638651	9640572	Why is that game, why is that song offensive?
9640592	9642853	Because it says Ave Maria.
9643173	9647735	I don't see how that, let me tell Mary, I don't see how that is offending a Christian group.
9649776	9652877	It doesn't say Ave Maria set your child on fire.
9653177	9653977	I mean, come on.
9654057	9654857	It doesn't even say that at all.
9654877	9657118	They're probably thinking it's blasphemous or something.
9657138	9658759	Oh my God, you've got to be kidding me.
9659355	9660636	I thought that I left Alabama.
9660676	9661397	What's up with this?
9661717	9662658	Fuck Christians!
9662998	9668642	I hate the goddamn stupid super Christians out there that want to convert all the evils in the world.
9669083	9673106	It's you people that ruin our TV and ruin our radio and music.
9673366	9678450	Goddamn, if I want to see boobies flash by accident on TV, that's my God-given right.
9678530	9684034	And if your children don't see, if happen to catch those boobies, it's time to tell them about life.
9684114	9684875	Because guess what?
9685275	9687957	One day or another they're going to see them, and that's that.
9688457	9698981	If your children catch sight of boobies or happen to hear shit, fuck, damn, no matter what on TV or the radio, it's your fault for not censoring them, okay?
9699461	9702662	The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio are absolutely true.
9704203	9707464	Do your goddamn job and stop blaming the media for...
9708982	9711883	Screwing up babysitting your children when it's not their responsibility.
9712363	9718204	If you're going to get knocked up and have the kid, you need to take some goddamn responsibility, okay?
9719484	9721565	You know what's a little funny, though, about the religious issue?
9721865	9727286	I do want to point out, Loki was giving an F you to what we coined super Christians.
9727686	9729066	Not all Christians, okay?
9729226	9732207	You can be religious and be one with God and all that stuff.
9732267	9733007	That's fine.
9733307	9735008	That's your right as an American.
9735328	9736108	Freedom of religion.
9736188	9736708	But remember...
9737523	9741506	Freedom of religion means I'm free to choose my religion as well.
9742326	9742747	Got it?
9743267	9743647	Good.
9744027	9745629	You know what's funny about the situation?
9747070	9751473	Christians say they want to stand up to themselves, yet they commit a sin.
9753194	9757977	A sin of wrath, of anger, saying this thing is offensive.
9757997	9761059	They go outrageous to the management and patent vending themselves.
9762120	9766383	And now they're doing almost the same thing to DDR because Heysel Fuse says the word fuck in it.
9767344	9770586	and they try to get rid of DDR and try to screw my tournament over.
9770646	9775609	If they want to screw my tournament over... I'm not sure if that was... Finger on the cam, okay?
9775629	9775889	Yeah.
9776730	9777230	Obviously.
9778531	9779911	I actually need to throw in an FU.
9780852	9783734	FU to the majority of humanity for being stupid.
9785234	9786015	And for sucking.
9788283	9815075	and now I have to censor my props for this tournament so these don't go too far so I can't use my fuck you hat or I have to put a I have to put a white label so it doesn't show fuck you on this I can't bring vibrators on the tournament as a prop I can't bring barbed wire, I can't bring glass, I can't bring a tit cup that I have and etc etc etc that results in provoking the media
9816977	9818277	because I don't want to get sued.
9819157	9821158	Unless I do a counter-loss and people stand up for me.
9823478	9824359	And let's see.
9825479	9832660	Well, since I don't know which FU's got into last week's show, I just have to say to be continued for now.
9834381	9836721	Oh good, we'll finish this show in three hours after all.
9836781	9838362	Alright, Arcadian, your turn.
9840682	9842522	Fuck you, this cold is hanging around still.
9844143	9845303	Fuck you to the puddles of
9845914	9846034	Angel!
9870097	9870617	Uh, F.U.
9870637	9873758	to being sick earlier this week, seems like that's going around around here.
9873778	9879500	Um, uh, yeah, I don't think, oh yeah, F.U.
9879520	9881820	to school is starting on Tuesday because I don't want to go, but whatever.
9882961	9886402	It's my educational goals or something.
9887603	9901200	and, uh, I don't want to, you know, work tomorrow, but I got to anyway, and whatever, so, that kind of sucks, and, um, I guess that's it, because I can't think of, uh, the FDs I was going to think of, so whatever!
9902552	9902913	All right.
9903433	9908659	With one notable exception, the room here is pretty not angsty tonight.
9908699	9910381	We have a lack of angst tonight.
9910401	9912043	I'm trying to keep it as a three-hour show.
9912063	9912864	Shut up, exception.
9914266	9914686	All right.
9916068	9920092	So let's go and see if our chat room outdoes us tonight in the angst.
9920152	9921033	We will have a look here.
9922735	9923156	Misty!
9924138	9925659	DarkNight says, DarkNight says, DarkTetsuya says,
9949793	9950374	in Seattle.
9951034	9953897	MPQ says, F you to Sonic commercials.
9954018	9955739	Not the Hedgehog, but the Burger Chain, I imagine.
9956240	9959183	Every time I see their commercials, I think, oh man, I want that.
9959283	9959744	But wait!
9960164	9961386	There aren't any around here.
9961946	9962306	You know what?
9962327	9963388	We have the same problem.
9963488	9967272	They advertise Sonic all the time in Sacramento, and the nearest one is an hour drive away.
9968584	9969044	Go figure.
9969184	9970205	There's a Sonic in Yuba City.
9970225	9970905	That's the closest one.
9971725	9975446	When I lived in the Bay Area, that's all we got was Sonic commercials.
9975746	9979208	And at least in the area that I was living in, we didn't even have one.
9979308	9980768	So, yeah.
9982649	9983689	Yeah, so we hear you there.
9984109	9988811	Also, F you to my parents insisting on using AOL even though we have cable internet.
9989471	9990632	That coming from MPQ.
9990812	9991652	I'm canceling mine.
9992472	9995613	VXChaseXV says F you once again to my manager.
9995853	9996974	F you, F you, F you.
9997174	9997514	That's all.
9999378	10004041	Phoenix says, F you to DarkSakura for booting me.
10004361	10007884	Ha ha, only kidding.
10008564	10011126	It's a damn good thing he put that only kidding thing in there, huh?
10011186	10011786	No, it's not.
10012066	10013828	She's going to work.
10015089	10018891	F you to the weather getting cold for tomorrow when I have to march.
10019211	10019672	Meh.
10022734	10023975	And he also says he apologized.
10023995	10027577	That was him that called in and he apologizes for his microphone screwing up.
10030379	10033280	DJ Ranma S says, That's no fun.
10055592	10061696	The Big Red Pimp, Ohio Bomani says, F you to the lack of a Chinese food restaurant in my back-ass town.
10065018	10067620	Dork says, one word, girls.
10070061	10073863	Now, I don't know if he means the song or girls in general.
10073963	10074624	You be the judge.
10075735	10099433	SSJ 100 Matt, says FU of the week, General Grievous slash Derek, not holding up his end of the deal FU leaving hometown New York City to go back to school in Phoenix DarkSakura, oh it's Samir, hi DarkSakura I sent that on behalf of somebody I forgot, you sent that on behalf of a friend, and it comes from EarthDragonOnyx
10100707	10105911	and the FU says I'm trying to decide on a new character so I have a poll going and someone said give it up.
10106531	10107112	Fuck him.
10108033	10108373	Yeah.
10110614	10114897	Raichan says FU to the people that go through life believing they deserve something.
10115098	10115478	Anything.
10115518	10116098	It doesn't matter.
10116459	10118460	You don't deserve anything in this life.
10118820	10120742	No one owes you anything.
10122623	10129428	And lastly Sephiroth 1215 says a big FU to General Grievous for telling on me.
10130839	10135063	I don't know who this general grievance person is, but they're busted.
10136244	10137926	What is that big bassy noise I'm hearing right now?
10138426	10138906	That's weird.
10140168	10140808	That's scary.
10140828	10142209	I heard like a big bass noise for a minute.
10142750	10143070	All right.
10143931	10144371	That's funny.
10144411	10145312	Phoenix in chat right now.
10145593	10146253	I like Sakura.
10146293	10146854	She's spicy.
10151017	10151478	Moving on.
10152264	10154908	We're going to go to a quick break, then we're going to come back and wrap up the show.
10154948	10156230	Can you believe it's that time already?
10156791	10159635	Got a couple more things we want to say to you guys, though, so stay tuned.
10159655	10160597	We'll be back after this.
10161037	10163000	Featuring a couple songs.
10163781	10165965	I want to do Rotel the Mercury, so we're going to do that song.

10564066	10565087	Monday night, yep, Jamie?
10565387	10567307	That's because my show is rad.
10567627	10568348	It is pretty rad.
10569308	10570548	It's better than mediocre.
10570969	10572329	You know, it's, you know...
10573760	10574240	It's okay.

10600869	10602129	And then Friday's over on The Freak.
10602774	10605695	Wednesdays we have the oldie and moldy Orange Launch Radio reruns.
10605995	10606875	They're still around.
10606975	10609436	We've got to get some new episodes up in there, so I'll try to shuffle that around.
10609776	10612357	I know we're going to have new music coming to Bomani Music & More this week.
10612997	10619219	We've got some of the songs from Fusion, some new 2DX11 songs, some of the secret songs.
10619259	10620179	I've got some copies of those.
10620199	10622360	We're going to put those in there, too, because there's some awesome songs in there.
10623020	10625081	What are the secret songs?

10634045	10636806	I just got called out and I lost big time.
10637086	10637786	Oh well, what can you do?
10641327	10641707	Let's see.
10642927	10643488	I guess that's it.
10643808	10645868	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
10645968	10647209	We'll start it off with Explicit.
10647489	10649269	Since you were the tardiest, you have to go first.
10649869	10650730	Your final thought.
10651650	10652810	Being late sucks.
10653450	10653931	There you go.
10654391	10657952	Being the second tardiest, Angel gets her final thought.
10659632	10660452	Need more game.
10660552	10661593	Oh wait, I have school this week.
10661633	10661833	Shit.
10663368	10665649	Arcadian, being prompt, thank you.
10666389	10668330	You get your final thought.
10668630	10669911	I hope I get broadband soon.
10670811	10671652	Very soon, hopefully.
10672372	10676234	And Loki, having the least amount of seniority, you get your final thought.
10677394	10678255	Tomorrow's going to be fun.
10680336	10683897	And my final thought is, I'm going to give Jamie her final thought.
10686579	10687319	Jamie, your final thought.
10687579	10691521	My final thought is, well, my lap's pretty warm from this laptop.
10695573	10697474	Go outside and do something, people!
10698535	10700195	Except unless we're broadcasting.
10700856	10706718	The final word of the show I'm going to give to Mr. Quiet Arcadian42 because he's got to say something, damn it.
10707299	10708759	One word to sum it all up.
10710540	10711160	Leprechauns.
10713682	10718564	That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.
