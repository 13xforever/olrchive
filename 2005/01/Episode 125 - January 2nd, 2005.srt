00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,220
What?

30
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:57,220
I have a mouth full of asparagus.

31
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:02,220
That's not what I heard. It sounded like she was mumbling, like, local street names and stuff from around here.

32
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:07,220
here all right also in that corner the other co-host the fabulous wonderful

00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,580
guests in studio especially some old favorites which we have here tonight yes

37
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:32,000
I think some of you guys are now designated old favorites, including...

38
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,340
Old, maybe.

39
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,220

40
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,420
Psycho Forum goddess. Head bitch.

00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:47,420
Say hello to Iguana Girl. Uh, hi. Yo, what up?

42
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:51,060
How you doing? That mic's a little quiet. I was noticing that.

43
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,020
From the gut. You don't want me to go from there.

44
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,900
I'm blasting everybody out. You gotta yell like you're yelling at newbies.

45
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,340
If only you knew.

46
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,380
Alright, also joining us tonight

47
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,940
say hello to Islander. Hello everyone.

48
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,540
How you doing? Oh, good and loud. Absolutely.

49
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,980
I learned my lesson. We have a new microphone. We finally, after about four weeks, replaced

50
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,140
that microphone that was cutting out for our guests,

51
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:26,520
but it's a little quiet so because we had to play some mic roulette actually

52
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:33,800
so yeah anyway also say hello to joining us on this show it hasn't been here in

53
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:41,080

54
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:46,480

57
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:04,160
well I'm late ah now they would have never known that because you were here

58
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,360
right before your to but you just had to go and spill all the beans and now they

59
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,440
knew you're tired our webcam wasn't even on they couldn't see all right anyway

60
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,200
Can I just start off by saying, I love our chat room.

61
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,960
I love our chat room, www.orangelandsrader.com, click on chat.

62
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,520
I love this. MPQ in chat says, every time I hear the opening I think my mom will

63
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,400
think I'm looking at porn or something,

64
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,520
because you know we have that sexy voice in there. You're listening to Orangelsands, right?

65
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,240
And then somebody else replies here, uh, shade23 says,

66
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,240
well why aren't you?

67
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:52,240
Great. All right. Well, join in the fun by heading on over to our chat room, or be a loser and just, you know, sit there in the background and just listen to us in the background. No, that's fine.

68
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,240
We understand some of you guys have more important things you might be trying to do right now, like-

69
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,240
Masturbating.

70
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,240
Homework, or-

71
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,240
Masturbating.

72
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,240
Masturbating to pornography. Fair enough. All right.

73
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,240
But we're going to keep the music and talk coming to you guys.

74
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,240
First off, I thought we might be able to do some music from 2DX Red.

75
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,240
Big 2DX game released last year. Now I can say last year, because we're in 2005.

76
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,240
So big 2DX game released last year. We're going to hear some music from 2DX Red.

77
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,240
And when we come back, all that randomness and chatter you've come to expect

78
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:29,240
your buddies here at Orange Lounge Radio. We'll be back!

79
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,240
I can't wait to see you in the next video!

80
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,240
Thank you so much for watching!

81
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,240
I'll see you in the next video!

82
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:23,240
Make my head to my head to my head

83
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:30,240
Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet, be quiet

84
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:33,240
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

85
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:39,240
Um, Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bamani Music and More program. Can we talk about that?

86
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,240
No subject will ever be taboo.

87
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,240
Well, I was thinking maybe we should move, pump up the volume from Tuesday nights?

88
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,240
Except of course the subject that was just under discussion.

89
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,000
discussion okay well what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of

90
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,920
the attack music we play on the station I collect your fucking head just like

91
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:05,080
this fucker here oh my god why did you do that to Loki the

92
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:11,920

00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,120

97
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:42,900

100
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:54,140
the skype line which I should sign into at some point but we will have orange

101
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,700

102
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:01,540
and all that good stuff just sitting here sitting back talking about music

103
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:06,140
based video games and, you know, Bamani-type games, and just, you know, really anything

104
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:10,220
that doesn't suck is fair game here. And even some stuff that does suck. We have a whole

105
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:14,260
segment dedicated to that. So, we'll get into that a little later. But first, we have to

106
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:20,020
start off tonight's show. We start off every week's show, 125 episodes, nothing's changed.

107
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,860
How was your week? How was your day? And we're going to start it off with a lovely, dark

108
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,540
Sakura who actually wasn't here last week because you were sick last week, right?

109
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:31,540
I was. I was actually pretty damn tired last week.

110
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,540
That's too bad to hear. Everything okay? But you seem good now.

111
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,540
But I have sexy jeans.

112
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,540
I haven't taken a look at your sexy jeans here.

113
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,540
I'm not wearing them. They're in the washer.

114
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:45,540
Oh, okay. Well, we want to see your sexy jeans. This is why we have a webcam.

115
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:50,540
Half of them are recessive. Actually, a quarter of them are recessive.

116
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,540
How does that work?

117
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:58,500
jeans are a quarter as fast as everybody's are.

118
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,980
How was your week, how was your day?

119
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:06,100
My week was, you know, I was getting all pissed off and stressed out at work, and then I went

120
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,500
to a job interview on Wednesday.

121
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:16,540
The next day I get called and offered the position, the damn next day, so I'm going

122
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:24,040
I'm going to be changing from the exciting world of student loans going into the exciting world, again, of home mortgages.

123
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,040
I'm going to be working in the escrow department.

124
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,540
Which is something probably I would estimate that 98% of our listeners know nothing about.

125
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:35,540
I would have to say that 98% of home owners know nothing about.

126
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:42,040
Considering our average age of the listener would be about, what, 12? I don't know. No, I'm kidding.

127
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:48,360
I don't know. But, well, more seriously, probably, I think, we've got our high schoolers, then

128
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,280
we have our twenty-somethings. A few of them might know.

129
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,280
Few of them might know. Well, for the people who probably have no

130
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,720
idea what escrow is, at least in the sense that I'm doing, you know, you always hear

131
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:05,360
closing escrow when you're buying a house. What an actual escrow is, is when you have,

132
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,280
you know, when you pay for your mortgage, your mortgage company has the option of paying

133
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:15,100
your taxes and insurance with your with your with your house payment so they

134
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,880
will actually set it up to where you have the money in a separate holding

135
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,900
account which is an escrow account to pay your taxes and insurance that's what

136
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,780
I'm going to be doing is making sure that they're managed properly because if

137
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:29,200
they're not gives people lots of trouble with the government makes people really

138
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,700
poor because trust me when you go to buy a house don't be a retard about it come

139
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:44,660
talk to me anyway so I'll so make making some changes other changes and as of

140
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:51,380
tomorrow I am back on the straight and narrow for my big resolution I'm going

141
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:56,700
to say this on the air tonight oh see last year I lost 50 pounds this year I'm

142
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:02,500
going to lose another 50 there you're gonna be a toothpick but before long

143
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,500
How long do you keep losing all this weight?

144
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,500
I don't think so. Not the way I'm doing it.

145
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,500
Alright.

146
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,500
I want like the Linda Hamilton Terminator 2 look. I want it to be tough.

147
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,500
Okay.

148
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,500
I want to kick people's ass.

149
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,500
Alright.

150
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,500
And then take out a submachine gun and go blow away. Oh, sorry.

151
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:22,500
I'm also going to take gun safety classes this year.

152
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:27,500
Oh no. I remember this was the discussion last January.

153
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,500
Is that Jamie was going to get a gun.

154
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,500
I couldn't afford a gun last year.

155
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,500
Thankfully the discussion went away for a while and now, great, it's back.

156
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,500
Jamie got a gun.

157
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,500
Okay, you know what?

158
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:46,500
When I go postal, the first place I'm coming is here.

159
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,500
Seriously, though.

160
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,500
Come on, it couldn't resist that one.

161
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:57,500
Um, I'm gonna, you know, we're talking about getting like, you know, a little crappy.22 rifle, but I'm gonna work up.

162
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,060
Remind me again. What do you need a gun for?

163
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:05,100
You shoot stuff, duh! Stress relief!

164
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:10,460
Stress relief, she says. What are you gonna be shooting? You're not gonna be going to golf?

165
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,460
An anime object. You're not gonna be going to golf land, are you?

166
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:18,100
RVGL children. You have to remember that Roseville Golf Land, for those who have never

167
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,980
been there, one of our local arcades we play at,

168
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:24,540
it's two stories and not a lot goes on on the second story. Except me with a

169
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,340
sniper rifle.

170
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:30,300
exactly that's my fear defile my machine I dare you

171
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:34,180
don't you think it would be quite humorous though if they put like a

172
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:38,780
silent scope machine up there dude that'd be rad

173
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:47,420
anyway I was sick on Christmas Day I'm sorry I was sick with like this nasty

174
00:20:47,420 --> 00:21:00,620
fatigue, which actually lasted into Sunday. I got up, I went to breakfast, went to bed.

175
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:06,260
Got up, went to dinner over at Dan's aunt's house. Then when he was, I said, just take

176
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:10,020
me home. I'm not going to be able to hang out with your cousins. He's like, let's go

177
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:17,020
go play DDR at your cousin's house. No. No, Jamie, go bed. I went home. I sat up for about

178
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:21,700
an hour just, you know, checking my email, settling stuff. My ass was in bed. I was like,

179
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:28,700
no, I can't deal with it. So, I was asleep for most of Christmas. Well, you know, in

180
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,720
some ways, sometimes it's better that way to be asleep for Christmas. But I did get

181
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:39,720
nifty presents. I got gift cards. Which means that the day after, I was basically wearing

182
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,680
myself out shopping, but it was fun. It was very fun. I went shopping with Tia and Jessica

183
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:53,040
and we had a fun time. The day after Christmas is kind of a nightmare shopping day though,

184
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:59,440
because I remember that I was at Best Buy I think that day and I just, oh my gosh, it

185
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:05,360
was crazy. The line was going around the block. It was pretty crazy. Just the thing is that

186
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:11,320
But I didn't have, I mean, basically I was really, really, I shouldn't, by all rights

187
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:17,440
have been out, but it's the day after freaking Christmas, sales, you know, womanly instinct

188
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,760
is stronger than fatigue sometimes.

189
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,040
And then I had an egg nug frappuccino.

190
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,740
I wish Starbucks would never get rid of those, because they're so good, and I know they're

191
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,840
going to be gone Monday, probably, makes me sad.

192
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:37,140
I'm actually glad they're gone because they prove to be too much temptation, especially

193
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,140
with the Starbucks.

194
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:42,220
You know, the one thing that keeps me away from the Starbucks by my present location

195
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:46,140
of work is the fact that it's right by a freaking Target.

196
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:50,600
So traffic is enough to keep me away.

197
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,720
I know a lot of people out there are very, very anti-Starbucks.

198
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,280
And for those of you guys that don't have a Starbucks in your neighborhood, just wait.

199
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,760
You'll have one soon.

200
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,760
It's a coffee shop.

201
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,760
For those that didn't know, it's huge.

202
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:07,040
Mississippi orgy going on. It is law. I'm talking Starbucks, hold on.

203
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,800
Mississippi orgy can wait. It's kind of week and day. Two.

204
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,280
But I just want to say Starbucks, it's not as bad as you people make it out to be.

205
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:18,200
They have great, some of their coffee is so good. Even if it is a month old.

206
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,440
Yeah, anyway I'm sorry to interrupt. Their coffee means our month old.

207
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,760
At least. But now in Mississippi it's law that if you have

208
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:31,080
more than three people in the same room, at least of course one has to be of a

209
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:36,520
different gender and they're not wearing shoes it's an orgy in the state of

210
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:41,200
Mississippi. You have got to be kidding. I'm not kidding you at all. It is true. So let's

211
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,520
see, Jamie doesn't have shoes on. The guana girl doesn't have shoes on. I don't

212
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:52,680
have shoes on. Thank God we're not in Mississippi. Sorry people in Mississippi.

213
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:58,800
But thank God. With all due respect to our friends in Mississippi, thank God

214
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:07,080
were not you and and you know I actually have room to say this because I've been

215
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:13,400
in Mississippi I'm from Alabama I have been in Mississippi quite a bit my mom

216
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:24,400
works in Biloxi I like California um and also as far as the rest of my weekend

217
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:31,400
have been, it's just been, today has been kind of, yesterday was really just weird for

218
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:36,840
me. I'd have to say it ended well, it ended very well. That's good. But today has just

219
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,960
been like, ugh, rain, ugh. I noticed you were a little drained yesterday. We were doing

220
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:48,080
the top 10, 14 show, whatever, 10 or 14, whatever it was, over on DDR Freak Radio, and I think

221
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,560
we were all feeling a little drained after that. Yesterday morning. I think we were just

222
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:56,480
used to doing these these things on Sunday nights so well I had tried to

223
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,560
stay up doing and see that this is actually I did Bimani stuff this weekend

224
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:06,800
I played two hours of 8 style and like beat almost everything in light 7

225
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:19,080
stupid Safari stupid B stupid a stupid Sakura that's not me but anyway I also

226
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,520
though they made me play karaoke revolution and they had kr3 and so I

227
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,620
knew the only way that I'd get to here waiting for you is if I was the one to

228
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:30,620
sing it so I was like okay well I'll do that and I was like oh that song's cool

229
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:34,080
who did that and so I got to be all nerdy and say hey that's from silent

230
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:43,440
hill 4 you should play that but uh today's just been you know yesterday

231

yesterday though see I was headachy and sick all New Year's night New Year's Eve

232
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:54,260
and then yesterday morning I was just feeling really just out of it because I

233
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:59,120
did something really stupid the night before after consuming two bottles of

234
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:04,720
Guinness in ten minutes and for those of you that were listening about six

235
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,080
months ago when we had our last drunk show was it that one I think it was oh

236
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:13,820
yeah when I passed out in your bed and then proceeded to eat four waffles that's

237
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:17,420
I think that was the same show where I was kicking at the wall going I'm in the

253
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,340
eBay.

254
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:52,380
Did you remember that guy that sold the French toast that had the Virgin Mary's likeness

255
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,380
in it?

256
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,380
Wasn't he like 10 years old or something?

257
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:59,740
Yeah, he had saved it for 10 years and finally was like, time to move on.

258
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:02,940
Anyway, sorry to keep interrupting you.

259
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:06,260
That reminds me of, do you remember the old Bloom County comics?

260
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,260
Yeah.

261
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,060
The first Opus ones?

262
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:14,580
had the one about the woman who had the image of Elvis in mold on her refrigerator and then

263
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:23,020
later on the crowds dispersed because it turned into Mr. Ed, the mold crew. But anyway, I'm

264
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:29,100
in a much better mood now than I was, but I was in crap, crap mood all day. So I'm happy

265
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,100
now.

266
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,100
Alright, yay happy.

267
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:35,580
Look at me grin. And of course the people listening will never ever see this because

268
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,580
I fear...

269
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,580
Webcams.

270
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,580
...the webcam.

271
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:42,900
fair enough. Alright, let's move on.

272
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,100
Loki! We haven't heard a lot from you yet tonight, how was your week, how was your day?

273
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:50,500
But little does she realize, we've hidden a hidden camera up above Rob

274
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,380
to capture her, without her knowing- oh, just a second.

275
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,380
You can bite me.

276
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:59,580
Hot Orange Lounge upskirt cam dot com!

277
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,380
I'm wearing... I'm wearing jeans. Doesn't work.

278
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,880
This is why nobody visits that site.

279
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,580
Yeah, Rob's the one wearing the skirt.

280
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,380
Zoinks!

281
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,580
Anyways, um...

282
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:19,980
How this week sucked.

283
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,080
That's it.

284
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,480
Didn't do anything.

285
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,880
Um, what'd I do yesterday?

286
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,280
Oh, that's right, nothing.

287
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,480
And, um...

288
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,480
New Year's Eve?

289
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:01,480
Yeah, that's about it.

290
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,480
Alright, I'll go later, so let's hear from some guests.

291
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,480
Where's the mic getting handed over there? Alright, Jazz! Who, by the way,

292
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,480
won one of our Kiryamoka CDs. Yay!

293
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,480
And if I remember right, one of the rules for the contest was that being here so many times

294
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,480
rendered you ineligible, but you were just under that? Yeah.

295
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,480
I've been here once before. Okay, so now this is your second. What was it, like three times?

296
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,480
It's kind of funny if this would push you over that limit after you've already won the contest, but...

297
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,480
Hee hee hee. Technicalities rule.

298
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,480
Alright. Didn't you end up giving away that CD to one of your friends?

299
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,480
Yes, for Christmas I gave it to my best friend.

300
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,480
And what did she say?

301
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,480
She said, oh my god, a bunch of times.

302
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,480
That was very funny.

303
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,480
Aww, how cute.

304
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,480
Aww, I'm glad she enjoyed it. Alright.

305
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:51,480
Alright. Well, for my week, I basically just came up to Sacramento on Friday night for New Year's Eve.

306
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:57,200
that was fun because we all played Mario Party and that was fun because me and

307
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:02,280
Rob were princesses and every time we got team together we would kick ass you

308
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,640
don't understand you don't understand there's a rule about when Rob plays

309
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:10,760
Mario Party I have to be Princess Peach or I throw a fit like a little baby okay

310
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:18,560
so I took daisy because Robert took peach and I got mad anyway after New

311
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:25,560
years I slept for a little bit then I woke up and then I came here for the top

no don't be sorry that's a great game it's hilarious rumble roses is pretty

315
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:56,800
The story mode is just hilarious for that game and so today I went to RVGL for the first time in, like, ever.

316
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,800
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

317
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,800
Actually, it wasn't too bad.

318
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:03,800
It's not as bad as like it was about a year ago. If you'd gone about a year ago, it would have been like, oh boy.

319
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:10,800
But now, you know, it's improving. Did you say hello to the new 2DX machine that has no monitor?

320
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:10,800
Yes.

321
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,800
Oh, okay. Just curious.

322
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:19,800
Let's see, uh, basically I just played Tekken 5 all day, and that was fun, because I finally

323
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:24,120
have a card, even though it costs $5, but I don't care, because it's a good game, it's

324
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,120
good, dammit.

325
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,120
$5?

326
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,120
It's $5 for a card.

327
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,880
Dude, I got one in Alabama for one.

328
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,880
Is it gold-plated or something?

329
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,880
No.

330
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,880
It's like a credit card.

331
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,280
I'll show you mine in a moment, you can put it on the cam.

332
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:41,040
I went to an Amco arcade, though, they had Tekken 5, like, forever, and no one was playing

333
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:49,040
So I was like, shoot, I paid $10 worth of Tekken 5, $1 if it was my card.

334
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,540
The chick related to Jun.

335
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,540
Asuka?

336
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,540
Asuka, yeah.

337
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,540
Same person as you.

338
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:58,860
Just because Jun's moves are not fun anymore.

339
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:02,340
I'm kind of a Tekken retard, so explain something to me.

340
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:06,460
What exactly is the difference between Tekken 4 and Tekken 5, besides the card thing?

341
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:09,020
Tekken 4 was dumb and Tekken 5 isn't.

342
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,580
I like Tekken 4.

343
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:13,300
I liked Tekken 4 a whole bunch.

344
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:18,060
Tekken 4 was basically, to me, it seemed like Tekken was trying to be like DOA, and it did

345
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,140
not work at all for me.

346
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:24,140
And Tekken 5 is a lot more like Tag, which I loved, so it worked a lot for better.

347
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:28,620
I didn't care for Tag, but I do like Tekken 5 just because I was a Jun player in Tekken

348
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,620
2.

349
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,620
Wait, it's...

350
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,540
And that's why I played Jin, because I was also a Kazuya player.

351
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,540
Yeah.

352
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,540
And he was like the best.

353
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,020
Who's the guy without the shirt that all the girls swoon over?

354
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,020
Jin.

355
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,020
Jin.

356
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,020
Then again, there's also Pho Rong.

357
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,020
But he was the Korean guy with the red hair.

358
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,020
No, I'm not talking about Hora, I'm talking about you guys.

359
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,020
Okay. Is Jin in Tekken 5?

360
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,020
Yes.

361
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,020
Okay.

362
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,020
And he's still hot.

363
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,020
Okay. That was my next question. Thank you.

364
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:52,020
And that was about it.

365
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:57,020
Alrighty. Let's move on to Islander. How was your week? How was your day?

366
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:07,020
Uh, week was actually pretty good. Pretty good. Just spent all, work was so damn slow that I just spent my entire day trying to find stuff to do.

367
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:10,860
It was to the point where we were cutting papers for screw or like for just for scratch paper

368
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:15,660
And I must spend about a day doing that just out of shear borgen. It was horrible

369
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:19,500
Were you making little crafts out of them too? No, you know, it's really funny

370
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,180
One of our roommates downloaded

371
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,140
He actually printed up some hit some papers on how to make

372
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:33,860
Origami rhinos and left them at work and I was half-concerting actually making some but didn't get around to doing it

373
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:42,660
But, anyways, um, other than that, you know, spent New Year's, um, you know, I didn't have

374
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:46,340
as many jello shots as I should have, because we still have a refrigerator full of them.

375
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:49,340
Maybe I should bring them here sometime.

376
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,340
They last a while.

377
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,980
Well, yeah, I mean, and we have a ton.

378
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:53,980
Unbelievable.

379
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,980
Anyway.

380
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:59,640
Those are some yummy jello shots, though, especially considering that they were low-carb

381
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,640
jello shots.

382
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,640
Absolutely.

383
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:07,640
When you consider the vodka and jello, no carbs, or at least the type of jello, yes.

384
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,640
It's lovely.

385
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,640
Oh, absolutely.

386
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,640
Good stuff.

387
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:17,160
But yeah, like, you know, Jazz and I played a lot of Rumble Roses.

388
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:22,480
When I went to Roseville today, he played second five, I played DLC, like I always do,

389
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,760
because DLC is my crack.

390
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:29,400
Is it just me, or is there now starting to become like a little Roseville Golf Land following

391
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,400
for Derby Owners Club?

392
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,400
No, there is, there is.

393
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,480
I was actually playing and there was this one guy

394
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,360
And there are people I've never seen before

395
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,040
There was one guy who was playing and he had some pretty good horses

396
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,500
and whenever he saw mine pop up

397
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,320
I could always hear a sigh from the back, it's like, ah damn, I don't want to be in for it

398
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,520
and I could not beat this fucker

399
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,120
I could not beat him

400
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,720
When we finally left, he actually turned around and said, hey man, you're pretty good

401
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,680
and I was like, wow, okay

402
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,800
Interesting, but yeah, there is a little following there and I hope it really takes off

403
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:03,300
In the beginning, though, if I remember right, half the following was just Milpitas people driving up to see their machine.

404
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,800
You know, in the end, the people calling in saying, hey, we want our machine back.

405
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,800
Oh, whatever happened with that?

406
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,800
How does it feel to want it?

407
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:16,300
You know what, though? That does kind of suck, if you're in that area, Milpitas area, and to have a machine like that.

408
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,800
They can go to Demon Busters, screw all of them.

409
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,800
Oh, that's true, that's true.

410
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,800
Poop, poop, poop.

411
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,800
True, true, true.

412
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,300
They can pay twice as much money.

413
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:27,300
I did that for a long time. Blah.

414
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:31,300
Well okay then.

415
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:35,300
About RVGL though, there was one very odd

416
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:39,300
thing that I saw. I was playing Drumania, sucking like usual

417
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:43,300
because I don't play Drumania, and there's this guy next to me.

418
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:47,300
It was obvious to me that he's kind of mentally handicapped in

419
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:51,300
some way, but then he went up to the Guitar Freaks

420
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:58,020
Tarfreak's screen and either licked it or sniffed it. And I was just mortified beyond

421
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:03,580
all belief. Maybe he didn't understand how to play the game. He was like sniffing Tran

422
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:08,260
or something. I was like, what the hell is going on? And yeah, that was a little scary

423
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:15,260
so I ran away. I can smell your cunt from here! Oh no you didn't!

424
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:26,860
Rob is red, this is funny. I think what made that so funny is because

425
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:32,460
I was really out of nowhere. I mean, just, not only was it out of nowhere, but it was

426
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:42,060
obscure that I think maybe two of our listeners got it. Anyway sorry. Rob, you forgot one

427
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:48,860
more reason why it was funny. Well, that makes me want to crawl under the table because I

428
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:56,260
know what's coming next. Well, he hasn't had proper warning about that. I'll let him live

429
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:00,300
this time. Alright, well since you got a mic Iguana girl, let's talk about your week and

430
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:06,920
your day, which was hopefully C-bomb free. It was until now, bitch. Hey, that's what

431
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:12,880
we're here to do, to fulfill your naughty words quotient of the week. It's what I get

432
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:19,560
for missing Rocky all this time. I have to get it someplace. The week was relatively

433
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:27,640
calm. Like Jamie was saying, we did the whole big massive shopping trip on Sunday, which

434
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:35,480
is pretty cool because I have really, really, really, really, really needed new clothing.

435
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:41,040
I've been shrinking out of everything that I own and it's very difficult to find new

436
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,660
clothes that are at a decent price for big people.

437
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,920
But best new reason to buy new clothes though.

438
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,920
Exactly.

439
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,920
Exactly.

440
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:53,080
So I took my $200 and got a bunch of new bras and all that.

441
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,240
La, la, la, la, la.

442
00:38:55,240 --> 00:39:01,160
Hey, those suckers cost a lot, buddy. I paid 52 bucks for four bras and that was on sale.

443
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,640
See, you know what? Walmart,

444
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,360
five bucks for a three-pack undies. It's hard to find.

445
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,560
Okay, let me put it this way. It's hard to find

446
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:15,440
bras this big for cheap prices.

447
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,720
Alright, alright. It's like, you know, it truly is an over-the-shelf brothel herder.

448
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:23,280
Did you hear that, boys? Big bras. You know what that means.

449
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:32,120
But, uh, we ended up going over to Old Navy and found my jackpot.

450
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:37,360
I managed to get four shirts and two pairs of pants for $100, and I was all super happy

451
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:42,960
because I told myself I wouldn't get anything over a certain size, and I didn't, so yay!

452
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,520
But, uh, that's about it.

453
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:49,240
My week was pretty boring.

454
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,400
I fell asleep a lot.

455
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:56,320
of the holidays are for though? Yeah. I was really tired and I pulled a butt

456
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:03,000
muscle. Now how did you pull a butt muscle? I was at the gym on Friday doing

457
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:09,720
my fit track appointment with Jamie's and my mutual trainer and I was doing

458
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:14,520
some sort of chest press and as I stood up to move to another machine my butt

459
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:20,000
muscle just went tweak and suddenly my butt muscle hurt like hell. So my butt

460
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:27,000
muscles hurt ever since, kind of on and off. My butt's sore. I think I need one of those

461
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:34,120
little butt pillows. Something you can strap to your bottom. Something like that. Oh my

462
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:45,760
gosh, I'm so glad half our studio isn't wired up right now. Okay. That's about it. I won't

463
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,760
I won't hurt you with more butt muscle stuff.

464
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,760
That's alright. That's what they tune in for.

465
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,760
And my socks are in the dryer.

466
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,760
Because my feet were wet.

467
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:01,760
This show, honestly, it's about Bamani, and it's about Iguana Girl's butt. That's it.

468
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,760
Oh yeah, and I did that show yesterday.

469
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,760
Oh yeah, the show. The show was good. We'll talk about the show a little bit.

470
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:13,760
We don't want to recap the whole show because I assume that it's going to be played again later.

471
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,440
but uh... you know we'll talk about the show

472
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:20,220
already made my age joke for the week

473
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:23,100
angel how was your week how was your day

474
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:26,760
uh... pretty good i spent the holidays uh... up in the bay

475
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,160
uh... with my folks

476
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,300
and

477
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,160
it was pretty good except for the fact that

478
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,060
uh...

479
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:38,600
i had internet on tuesday the day that i arrived there by wednesday i didn't have

480
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,600
internet

481
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,760
until

482
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,220
christmas day

483
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:45,120
which didn't really matter anyway because

484
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,720
i ended up being sick from

485
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,280
christmas day till

486
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,520
the tuesday

487
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:54,520
that i had or not the tuesday i had to leave but you know the last day i was supposed to

488
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:57,120
be at my folks so

489
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,260
that kind of sucks

490
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:02,880
i didn't have internet and then i got sick

491
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,200
it was basically like a stress panic type deal

492
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,040
cause it was like the first time

493
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,120
i had been back

494
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:14,500
uh... to my parents house since uh... i moved out so i don't know why

495
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:18,160
it happened but i guess stress is kind of

496
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,560
known to do that i guess and

497
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:25,120
but christmas is good got some dvd's i wanted

498
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,240
and uh... all that

499
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,860
so i was happy about that

500
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:33,640
and new years was spent

501
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,000
or new years eve rather

502
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,360
was spent just

503
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,780
watching the tv until the fireworks went off and then

504
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:42,720
the news station was kinda cool cuz

505
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,660
you know four sets of fireworks going off at the same time so that was pretty

506
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,780
interesting to watch

507
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:49,260
and then i had a bloody mary for the first time

508
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:53,180
yay angel drank oh my god

509
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:56,980
actually no i cheated cuz i only had a third of that and then like a third of

510
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:59,780
a glass of champagne and then i was just like duh

511
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:02,500
and i still don't like champagne

512
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,680
there's that

513
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,560
and then

514
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:10,680
I've been bad because I've been on a certain game for the past, let's see, wait, probably

515
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,640
since Wednesday.

516
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,000
Not as bad as the other two in here.

517
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,040
Wait, I've been on the valve.

518
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,040
Yeah well.

519
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,040
I'm going to check my plans today.

520
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,040
Uh oh.

521
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,040
Jazz!

522
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:33,280
Um, yeah, so, yeah, I've been playing that just a little too much, but it's okay, because

523
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,520
It took me four months to get to that point, so you know what, just yay, alright?

524
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,120
That's it.

525
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,040
I'd just like to point out for the record that I have not been quite the addict, because

526
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:47,160
I remember, I did sign on to Final Fantasy XI for a little bit this morning, and I got

527
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:52,400
a message from DDR Angel, and suddenly I noticed, I'm like, dang, that girl's gained six levels

528
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,280
since yesterday, how much has she been playing?

529
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,840
Um, lots of PL, that's all I have to say.

530
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,840
Alright, anyway.

531
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:05,360
So, my week and my day, yeah, okay, a little bit of Final Fantasy XI, but not too bad.

532
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:10,080
I did go out and do some stuff. I went to Iguana Girls New Year's Eve, bashed a little

533
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:15,280
gathering of people there, and I learned how to play Texas Hold'em by watching celebrity

534
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:20,440
poker, which I hadn't done before. But I love Kathy Griffin, oh my god, I love her, and

535
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,680
even though she annoys the hell out of most people, I think she's so funny, and she was

536
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:27,320
on the show, and she was the first person booted out that particular episode. Sorry

537
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,320
Sorry to ruin it for you.

538
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:32,100
She was the first person booted out that particular episode, but it was a good watch, and I learned

539
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,100
how to play Texas Hold'em.

540
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:36,940
So next time you guys have a poker night, it's on.

541
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:37,940
It's on.

542
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:45,900
Let's see, outside of that, New Year's Day, one of my buddies had his birthday, and he

543
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:49,020
lives out in the middle of nowhere, California, basically.

544
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:53,360
He lives about an hour's drive from here, and once you get about an hour out of Sacramento,

545
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,620
this is why they call it Cowtown, okay?

546
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:59,360
Unless you're going the hour towards the bay, that's about it.

547
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:03,140
The other hours all around it is nothingness and there's really...

548
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:08,240
It looked like the town out of Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, kinda.

549
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,240
But it was cool.

550
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,240
No, it was cool.

551
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,240
We had a good time.

552
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,740
And that was pretty much it.

553
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:18,700
In Bimani-related news, gasp, gasp, in my life, for the past few days I have been playing

554
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:24,200
workout mode in UltraMix 2, which I've actually been finding quite a lot of fun and I've been

555
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,880
been playing for at least 20 minutes every day. Getting a little bit of exercise, trying

556
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:31,340
to get some of my stamina back, because I figure if I play 20 minutes every day for

557
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:39,900
a couple weeks, I'll be able to pass Katas back to back again, without having to stop.

558
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:44,880
Which is how it's been lately. So, we'll see what happens. Other than that, that's pretty

559
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,880
much it. Not a whole lot else for me to report that I can think of off the top of my head.

560
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,780
I don't think so. Maybe later, so we go through the rest of the show. Alright, in fact, we're

561
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:59,380
We're going to go to a break here, and when we come back from the break, we're going to

562
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:06,920
talk about some new years news, and I want to talk about that other new music game that

563
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:10,000
I finally have to take a look at today, even though it's been out for like three months.

564
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,780
So we'll talk about that a little bit, and that'll be it when we come back.

565
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:18,300
This break we're going to have some music.

566
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:21,420
Some things that Jamie was saying there kind of inspired me a little bit, so I thought

567
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:25,420
I thought we could do a break of music that makes Jamie angry.

568
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:26,420
That makes me angry?

569
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:27,420
Yes.

570
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,420
Starting with the...

571
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:29,420
Well, is it all voluntary?

572
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:30,420
No.

573
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:31,420
No.

574
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:32,420
It's going to be the Safari to start it off.

575
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:33,420
I like the...

576
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:34,420
As long as you don't play the fast, crappy one.

577
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:37,420
I actually like the song, but it pisses me off to play.

578
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:38,420
Exactly.

579
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,420
These are going to be songs that piss Jamie off to play.

580
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:42,420
Although I did manage to stay about a 50% on it.

581
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:43,420
Alright.

582
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:44,420
Well, there you go.

583
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:45,420
Alright, here we go.

584
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:46,420
We'll be back after this.

585
00:51:46,420 --> 00:52:12,020
Hi, this is Melby of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Melby can join

586
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:14,020
us on all the fun together.

587
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:21,020
Hey, hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great?

588
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:28,020
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights. Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

589
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:34,020
Hello and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, our old buddy Mel there. I don't know when he's coming back for the show.

590
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:36,020
That was at one of our very early shows.

591
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:45,020
That, I believe, Mel came out for Episode 6, which was a long time ago.

592
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:48,020
Back when I was still using the headset.

593
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:50,020
Oh gosh, oh yes.

594
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:53,020
That I acquired from Memories.

595
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:59,020
We need to have an official nostalgia segment of the show, I think, because it comes up every week.

596
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:01,020
Remember back when Orange Lounge was cool?

597
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:03,020
Hey, we're always cool.

598
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:05,020
I know, I'm just playing around.

599
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:10,940
Let's see, what's going on this week? We had the big show we were doing here yesterday

600
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:18,460
over on, you know, that other radio station, DDR Freak Radio, which is, no, it's fun, it

601
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:22,340
was a good time, it's always fun to partner up with another station, kind of put your

602
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:27,460
resources together to do something fun, and it was pretty cool to be a part of the first

603
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:32,700
live show that DDR Freak had really done. Was it their, the first live show?

604
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:39,120
There was a very, very brief, like 15 minute thing that I did that was just me being incredibly

605
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:46,880
bored and experimental, and I did the whole radio DJ bit for a whopping season.

606
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,360
You're listening to DDR music at the top of the hour?

607
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,360
Exactly.

608
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,360
Okay.

609
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:53,360
Exactly.

610
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:57,760
So I consider yesterday being the first DDR Freak Live special.

611
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:00,360
The first horror show, basically.

612
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:03,480
the one you got to whore out to the masses to get people to tune in.

613
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:12,280
Because you know, I've done all of the other crap with the history of DDR and, you know, it's cool and all, but I want, you know, interaction.

614
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:19,080
I want to be able to get the people involved and that's, you know, whenever we get the people involved, that's when we get the numbers.

615
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:26,960
Absolutely, absolutely. So that was going on and a very interesting list. It was a top 14. It was originally going to be a top 10.

616
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:30,660
Yeah, because not enough people got their butts out there and voted.

617
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:36,880
To their credit, though, it was only a day, but still, more people could have done their

618
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:37,880
part.

619
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,100
But it's alright, it happens.

620
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:42,700
It's the holidays, I guess.

621
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:46,740
So it ended up, because of all the ties, there was a top 14 list they came up with.

622
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:48,700
Now, we don't want to ruin it.

623
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:51,740
A lot of you guys probably already figured it out for yourselves, maybe, if you know

624
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:53,300
how to do that.

625
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:55,940
Or some of you guys may have tuned in.

626
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:59,700
But there are going to be replays coming up soon and those will be announced over on DDR

627
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:01,020
Freak Radio.

628
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:05,780
For you dial-up users, because I don't think it's going to show up on DDR Freak Lowband,

629
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:06,780
right?

630
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:07,780
No.

631
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:08,780
No.

632
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:09,780
Lowband is pretty much dying out.

633
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:13,120
It will probably be disbanded after the year is up.

634
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:14,620
Very few dial-up users anymore, though.

635
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:15,620
Very, very few.

636
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:16,620
Very few.

637
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:21,340
We don't have plans to ditch the dial-up friendly stream anytime soon just because of the fact

638
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:24,860
that since we're MP3 Pro, we can stay a pretty good quality.

639
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:29,220
And again, if you guys don't know what MP3 Pro is, and we're not sounding like FM quality

640
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:31,580
to you, then you're missing the MP3 Pro codec.

641
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:35,660
And if you want to just get more information on that, go to www.orangeonsready.com and

642
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:39,980
click on the FAQ, and that'll give you all the information on the MP3 Pro codec.

643
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:43,940
And if, like, if you're listening to us in your iTunes player right now, iTunes does

644
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,500
not have MP3 Pro codec.

645
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:48,840
So there's actually a much clearer version of the stream available.

646
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,080
All the information's over there.

647
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,080
Check it out.

648
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,080
But again, you don't have to do it.

649
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:56,140
just, you know, make things a little clearer. But I think for the foreseeable future we're

650
00:55:56,140 --> 00:56:00,120
going to stay dial-up friendly, because I know we still have a few of those. Very few,

651
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:07,680
but a few. And I want to say that the DDR Freak Top 10 Countdown we will broadcast for

652
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:14,100
our dial-up users, and for those that want to catch it, one time, and that's Tuesday

653
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:18,920
night, as part of Pump Up The Volume. So you have to tune into Jamie's show, because she'll

654
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:20,520
play the Top 10 show as part of her show.

655
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,960
And if you don't, I'll kick your butt.

656
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,480
Exactly. Same rule as always, tune in or she'll kick your butt.

657
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:33,240
What did you think of the list that ended up though? Were you kind of surprised with it?

658
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:41,000
I'm not incredibly surprised. I'm surprised at how many songs from how many different mixes

659
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:47,080
got in there, which, you know, pleasant surprise on that front, but I'm really going to fucking

660
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:50,640
kill Dawn. I'm killing frequency, that's all there is to it.

661
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:54,100
Okay. Um, Dynamite Rave should not have been in that list

662
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:56,920
at all, thank you very much.

663
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:01,040
And let alone people voting for Dynamite Rave.

664
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:06,400
Good God. That's true, because not only did it have to get nominated, but it had to get voted on.

665
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,880
But, we're not stupid. We know that folks have their little cliques out there,

666
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,920
because, you know, hell, I had my friends voting for Skulk. I mean, what can you...

667
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:19,920
Yeah, but there were other people voting for Skull too, so that's why it made it in there.

668
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:27,920
But, you know, overall, I was pretty pleased to see some of the stuff that ended up on the list.

669
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,920
You know, I'm glad, I was very happy to see a lot of 2DX representation.

670
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:40,920
A lot of 2DX representation. My biggest surprise was the fact that I think on the whole list there was only two songs that were actually new in 2004.

671
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:44,320
I think, off the top of my head. Maybe

672
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:47,560
there's another couple... Not enough love for the US original stuff.

673
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:52,060
No, and that kind of surprised me, because I thought... I realize that some people have

674
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:55,240
issues with the US mixes and the way that they've been presented.

675
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:59,440
For example, Xtreme, people bitch about the interface, although...

676
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:03,280
They bitch about everything. Seriously, they bitch about everything, but the biggest bitch being the

677
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,540
interface, although,

678
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:09,960
you know, it's not that bad. But most people are okay with the songs.

679
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,960
You know, I hear a few bitches here and they're like,

680
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,960
Ehh, why is YMCA in there? That song's gay.

681
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:18,960
But usually, people seem to enjoy the U.S. exclusive songs, especially Max 2.

682
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,960
I think nobody can really complain about Max 2.

683
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:21,960
It was great music.

684
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:22,960
Yeah, it was.

685
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:28,960
All of the Max 2 stuff, even some of the Max stuff, it was just great.

686
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,960
But, oh well.

687
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:34,960
Yeah, don't go there.

688
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,960
He was making reference to a deep black forest.

689
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,960
Hey, I like dark black forest

690
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:43,960
See, I don't even know what it's called because all I can call it

691
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:52,100
See now I have to explain the story good in the beginning where he says into the dark black forest or whatever it is

692
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:56,680
All right. I'm afraid it's where we going. It sounds like the start of a porno

693
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:01,000
So I always hear big black cock

694
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:07,000
You know what's funny? I think that was a running gag on this show for a while, too.

695
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
It was, thanks to, um, Darkstown.

696
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:15,000
That was Darkstown. Hold on, hold on, let me, for those who don't know what the hell Iguana Girl's talking about, here is a little clip, okay?

697
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:21,000
It's a long way to go, honey.

698
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:26,000
I know, but I'm afraid. Where are we going?

699
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:33,000
into the dark black forest.

700
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:37,360
Alright, you need to get it. It just sounds like the start of a porno, I don't know.

701
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:42,760
Maybe it should be, I don't know. I'm afraid, where are we going? Shut up and take your clothes off, bitch!

702
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:48,560
I'm paid to cash up front, now take it off!

703
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:53,560
Well...

704
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:58,560
And Dark Black Forest could be a euphemism for something if you think about it.

705
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:00,560
You know what? We don't need to go there.

706
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:03,560
Someone who isn't very well kept.

707
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:07,560
We've had the C-bomb once.

708
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:09,560
Hey, I...

709
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:13,560
Both boys and girls can have this issue, okay?

710
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:15,560
Shaved ears, please.

711
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:18,560
We're Europeans.

712
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:23,560
Anyway, wow. Leave it to this show to go straight to the toilet.

713
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:25,560
Thankfully that song was not on the countdown.

714
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:30,560
Yeah, because heaven forbid that subject came up yesterday.

715
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:38,560
So, I guess I have to, this would be a good time to ask this question because

716
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:44,560
you know, DDR Freak, although I don't like to just sit here and talk about DDR Freak.

717
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:45,560
Neither do I.

718
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:50,120
So let's face it though, hon, it's a big part of the community and anybody that listens

719
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:55,320
to this show knows what DDR Freak is, they may not post everything.

720
01:00:55,320 --> 01:01:00,560
So DDR Freak is kind of family friendly, right, and a lot of people get frustrated because

721
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:04,720
they can't type shit and fuck, it gets censored, although some of the censored stuff is really

722
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:05,720
funny.

723
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:08,200
I personally like doggy, that's just me.

724
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,200
I like...

725
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,200
I like poopy.

726
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,200
I like cigarette.

727
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:17,680
best was, before when they first tried to start it, ass turned into butt. So someone

728
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:21,680
would try to type Massachusetts and type M-A-S-S and it turned into M-butt.

729
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:35,480
Now it's just buttocks. So, M-buttocks-chucets? I don't know. Anyway,

730
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:40,720
so is there a lot of youngins on DER Freak or is this, you just want to keep a G rating

731
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:46,720
We're trying to keep it as G-rated as possible just for the overall audience.

732
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:51,720
We get quite a few mentions on all of the different mixes that are coming out.

733
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:56,720
And one of the first places that people are going to go when they look up DDR is going to be DDR Freaks.

734
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:03,720
So we have to kind of try to keep that family-friendly vibe going so that somebody's 13-year-old kid

735
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,720
is going to be coming on there and their parents are going,

736
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:10,500
going oh my god is that the word fuck on your screen you know and freaking out or

737
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:15,800
something obviously there's ways around the filters and if you know if you're

738
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:20,000
smart enough you can kind of just ask anybody ask any of the ops in our chat

739
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,360
room they know how to do it quote somebody's post you know be able to see

740
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:33,120
it oh wait I give away a secret oh but yeah we we don't really we don't really

741
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:35,120
I actually... I openly advertise that.

742
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,120
See, I...

743
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,120
Well, that's okay. Nobody listens to this show.

744
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:44,120
I feel kind of bad because I dropped the F-bomb on yesterday's show.

745
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:47,120
Kind of forgetting that whole family-friendly vibe.

746
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:48,120
You know, honestly...

747
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:51,120
At least I didn't say what Loki said earlier.

748
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:55,120
I'm not too concerned about it.

749
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:57,120
It's no big deal.

750
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:00,120
I was the one sitting there making AIDS jokes, so...

751
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:05,240
If there's nothing, you know, less family-friendly, less family-friendly than the internet.

752
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,120
Or politically correct, really.

753
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,120
Yes.

754
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,120
Yes.

755
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,120
All right.

756
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,120
All right.

757
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:14,280
I just had to ask about the, you know, family thing, because I think, I think some people

758
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,280
out there...

759
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:18,420
Okay, even, here's the catch-22 that we have.

760
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:22,720
We have specifically, when you sign up for the site, when you sign up for the forums,

761
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:29,660
it asks you, it says, I am over the age of 13, and you cannot agree to that unless you're

762
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:35,980
over the age of 13, or you're lying. So unfortunately we do have, you know, 11-year-olds, 12-year-olds.

763
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:39,660
I was going to say, how old is the youngest poster though? Because I...

764
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:44,380
We've got like, you know, we've got like DDRbot. Yeah, wow. And isn't DDRbot like 10 or something?

765
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:52,180
I think so, I think so. Yeah. So the youngest I think is probably around 9 or 10. And it's

766
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:58,300
not, we usually don't cause problems about it unless they're causing issues. And it's

767
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:04,880
just a matter of maturity, typically. So I've met a lot of 16-year-olds that were less

768
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:09,740
mature than the 9-year-olds. Yeah, me too. And I've dropped the f-bomb quite a lot on

769
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:16,020
DDR Freak on the boards, but you know, you just... They're gonna learn it sometimes.

770
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:20,480
It's the way you say it. Yeah. Sometimes it's not what you're saying, it's the way you say

771
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:27,320
it, you know? And I can say, because I am an instructor of customer service, and I can

772
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:30,400
tell you kids, if you ever go out and get a customer service job, your instructor's

773
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,480
going to tell you the same thing.

774
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:32,480
Respond.

775
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:33,480
Don't react.

776
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:34,480
Exactly.

777
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,300
It's not about what you say.

778
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:39,600
What you say is only 10% of how the information is perceived.

779
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:43,320
And by the way, 35% of statistics are made up on the spot.

780
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:44,320
But...

781
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:45,320
I thought it was 43.

782
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,560
Whatever.

783
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:48,360
But it's how you say it, kids.

784
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:51,680
You know, I really don't give a crap about your problem, but let's tell you what we can

785
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:54,320
do to just BS our way through it.

786
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:55,320
Exactly.

787
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:58,840
When Darksecker said that it had a nice, friendly atmosphere to it, you know?

788
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:01,640
Who's been doing customer service for too damn long?

789
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:04,840
As I raise my hand?

790
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:11,960
Ironic enough, I just went through a stupid class in school doing that exact same shit.

791
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:14,360
Oh my god, I hated it.

792
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:17,720
All that just for one stinking little piece of paper.

793
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:23,160
Well, that piece of stinking paper is going to turn into a big wad of cash someday.

794
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:23,960
Just got to remember that.

795
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:24,600
We'll see.

796
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:34,320
I'll take the spotlight off of Drill DDR Freak for right now.

797
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:39,720
But speaking of DDR Freak, for whatever reason, despite the kid-friendly and family-friendly

798
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:43,840
atmosphere, they do rebroadcast this very show, Friday nights at 6 o'clock.

799
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,880
So tune into that, definitely.

800
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,800
I'm sure with the hefty disclaimer.

801
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:51,120
Just the standard disclaimers that...

802
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:54,060
We have a disclaimer right in the intro to the show.

803
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:58,920
does say there may be a scene of nudity in this program and there may be this

804
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:05,700
this program contains naughty language well shit so it's not my fault if you

805
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:10,600
tuned in halfway through you should have been here on time it's not like I

808
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:26,220
here all right but anyway I actually speaking of nobody being here I happen

809
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:29,460
to know that a lot of folks weren't here for last week's show I know because I

810
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:34,820
got the ratings okay people so this Friday on DDR freak great chance for you

811
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:38,180
guys to catch that episode if you missed it so Friday six o'clock all I'm gonna

812
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:43,580
say I don't want to ruin what went on but we had our own DDR freak the movie

813
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:50,660
parody thing going on priceless you got to hear it man that's a subject that

814
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:54,860
hasn't been heard of for years oh we just took that subject and ran away with

815
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:58,820
it though I know I know that that it's an it's old news but somehow it got

816
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:02,420
brought up last week and we just ran away with it on a random side note that

817
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:07,560
I just remembered again Rob yes we've been playing DDR for four years now

818
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:12,380
that's true oh my gosh this is our official four year anniversary of DDR

819
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:19,380
Yeah, actually last Sunday. Not today, but the first day we went to play DDR was sometime between Christmas and New Year's.

820
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:25,380
I played for the first time, well not for the first first time, but, you know, for first regular. Like our first regular session was.

821
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:35,380
Yeah, that was on the 26th. A little known fact, Iguana Girl and I played our first game, well actually no, most people that listen to this show know that now, because I know it's not the first time it's come up, but we played our first game of DDR together in Vegas.

822
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:41,440
October 2000. October 2000 and then we didn't play regularly until

823
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:46,220
one of us spotted the machine at golf. Was it me? You did it, you saw it, you played it,

824
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:50,300
and then I was jealous because I couldn't play it until the day after Christmas.

825
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:53,900
That's right. You know what, I remember now.

826
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:57,700
My memory is being jogged. I went down there because... You went there on Christmas Eve.

827
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:02,820
I went there to go play pinball or something. Yeah. So I was all pissed off because you had two more days than me.

828
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:07,140
me and that's what I kept it you know the reason why you were so much better

829
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:11,540
yes and amazingly amazingly enough suddenly I was passing nine-footers on

830
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:16,620
the third day and just left a guana girl in the dust go figure out not quite not

831
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:20,820
quite boys and girls it took me a long time to pass a knife long time has

832
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:25,860
nine-footer I remember a certain expedition to a certain golf land and a

833
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:32,300
certain Milpitas and the islander machine I remember the first time I met

834
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:42,500
Islander was at Fana made 2001 when I was cosplaying Emmy no it was before

835
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:46,500
that but I mean the first February February right right because of the

836
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:52,500
Milpitas trip right but does the second time then was at Fana me yeah and I was

837
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:56,660
sort of a little standoffish because of the shirt he was wearing a flip shirt

838
01:08:56,660 --> 01:09:06,660
It was something to wear. It was just something I didn't have. At the time I was collecting just random shirts.

839
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:10,660
Look boys and girls, what you don't know is he went home later and changed the oil with it, okay?

840
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:16,660
I also remember that that's when I met a bunch of people in the community was at that particular convention.

841
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:18,660
That was a great convention. It really was.

842
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:22,940
was I remember sitting on the floor after two days of sleep deprivation and

843
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:29,260
then Wendell sits next to me after two days of drinking actually he was drunk I

844
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:32,420
was sleep deprived so we were both in about the same frame of mind and going

845
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:38,020
having an interesting conversation and then he fell asleep I was actually in

846
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:40,860
the arcade room and I fell asleep on the chair that was right next to the DDR

847
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:44,940
machine oh yeah absolutely and so like I was sitting there and people were

848
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:49,380
walking up and they're like looking at me going oh man this guy's not doing his

849
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:59,540
job and I'm like what my first eat my first EDR machine that was the year

850
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:06,120
before that on a May Expo 2000 they had the third mix there and I was like why

851
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:12,940
are the arrows cap colors because I started playing with the first one on

852
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:17,620
PlayStation 98 and then I the only one I had ever owned was my second mix on

853
01:10:17,620 --> 01:10:24,300
Dreamcast. The first mix Jess and I ever played was a 1-5 right? I remember playing

854
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:27,260
Butterfly. Yeah we played Butterfly and we played Boom Boom Dollar. Yeah I remember

855
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:32,800
that but it didn't phase me when we when we moved up to USA because like that was

856
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,180
the next machine we'd played so I it never occurred to me that oh the first

857
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:39,980
time we played this didn't look all pretty like this you know just I all I

858
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:45,480
The first thing I noticed was, wow, there's so many songs in this, which is ironic considering

859
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:50,280
it was DDR USA mix, and I'm sitting there going, oh my god, this has a ton of songs.

860
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:51,280
What's this Boyz song?

861
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:52,280
This song's great.

862
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:53,920
Oh god, you heard that out.

863
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,920
Oh my god, you heard that out.

864
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,200
I was so tired of hearing that song.

865
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:02,880
I hoard Boyz by Smile DK on DDR USA.

866
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:06,600
And it pissed me off because when we were first starting out, it was hard for me.

867
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:10,600
I was having a hard time doing that on basic, you know?

868
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:15,600
It's like, it's kind of frustrating, you know, thinking back on it,

869
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:18,600
but yeah, I was pissed off at the fact that you kept doing boys

870
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,600
because I was like, you're going to kill me!

871
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,600
But I love Boys, the song.

872
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:27,600
Yeah, sure, the song.

873
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:30,600
But then again, I forced you through 20 November about 5 billion times, too.

874
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:33,600
I remember 20 November-a-thons, yes I do.

875
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:34,600
Yeah. Good times.

876
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:43,600
And our massive attempts at trying to take on the board, the high score board, because

877
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:48,600
back then, that was when Konami was doing their net ranking, right?

878
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:58,600
And back then, you could score the same on a basic song as you could on a maniac song.

879
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:02,720
it was it was something like that no I think it was 45 I think what it was

880
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:08,000
million is that you honestly there weren't that many people playing DDR yet

881
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,760
yeah so there wasn't that many people on the scoreboards and we were kind of like

882
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:16,400
wow if we could full combo that's it it didn't have to anything to do with

883
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:20,120
perfect grace or anything your score was full combo if you could full combo your

884
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:24,280
way through a bunch of songs you would be in good shape a couple times that I

885
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:28,480
had to do EOTC five times in a row I remember that we were trying to rank

886
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:31,480
Like, didn't we end up in the top twenty or something?

887
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:32,480
We were in the top five.

888
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:34,480
What? Were we really?

889
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:35,480
We were in the top five.

890
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:36,480
Were we?

891
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:37,480
Well, not-

892
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:38,480
No, I thought you meant overall in the U.S.

893
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,480
Yeah, no, no, no. I'm talking on just the machine.

894
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:42,480
Oh yeah, I remember the machine we ended up in the top five.

895
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:43,480
Yeah.

896
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:46,480
Because I remember on doubles, uh, Dark Sakura,

897
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,480
and this is when we first really were getting to know each other,

898
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,480
Dark Sakura and I had a friendly little competition going

899
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:53,480
where her and I were kind of battling each other on the doubles board.

900
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:55,480
We had the sandwich.

901
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:56,480
Yes, we had the sandwich for a while.

902
01:12:56,480 --> 01:13:03,240
for a while. Who was it? Uh, Lanky Style. Lanky Style. No, it was Brad Sandwich. I worked

903
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:07,840
my ass off to get first place on that damn machine. I remember. Jamie was the buns, because

904
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:12,280
she was first and last. I was first and last. And Brad, Lanky Style, on Thursday Night's

905
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:17,760
Program, was the meat, because he was in the middle, he was third, and I was the fruit,

906
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:21,680
second and fourth. You know how I got first place? How? I ended up getting first place

907
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:27,440
by doing Dynamite Rave doubles, basic, and full convo-ing it.

908
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:30,360
Oh I see, you were one of those ones that hoarded Dynamite Rave in the beginning.

909
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:33,400
I was one of the ones that hoarded Dynamite Rave, but then again, I was very proud because

910
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:35,680
Dynamite Rave was the first 5 footer I could do in doubles.

911
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:38,040
That's alright, you know what song I used to do it?

912
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:39,720
Love to me.

913
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:40,720
Oooooooh.

914
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:50,280
Alright, Nostalgia City, remember when all the cool kids were doing that?

915
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:52,520
I was never a cool kid.

916
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:57,640
You never did that? Not even once? I'm too fat to do that.

917
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:01,920
I'm serious. I would have fallen over if I tried to do that. I seem to remember that you did some

918
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:05,640
kind of white girl freestyle. Yeah, I was doing a white girl freestyle that didn't require me to

919
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,960
actually have to hit the pad with my hands.

920
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:12,440
I mean, I... well, alright. When you get down there, it's hard to bring yourself back up.

921
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:15,800
It's hard to bring yourself back up, yeah. It's one thing to fall. And you gotta keep in mind that

922
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:18,520
when I first started I was 270.

923
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:23,960
So it took me quite a long time to lose my initial 30 pounds, and that, you know, unfortunately

924
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:26,240
I gained more than that back.

925
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:29,560
But I've lost it again, so it doesn't matter.

926
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:31,080
We're clean slate now.

927
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:32,080
Yeah.

928
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,080
Yeah.

929
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:34,080
All right.

930
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:38,480
But for those of you guys that weren't, you know, you've only been playing DDR since like

931
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:43,360
fourth, max, whatever, and you kind of missed out on those USA days, if you want to see

932
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:48,120
what we're talking about, go to DDR Freak, look at the step chart for Love to Me Basic,

933
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:52,220
you'll see several portions of the song left right jump right you have left

934
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:57,540
right jumps and then down up in quarter notes right so the jump on left right

935
01:14:57,540 --> 01:15:04,100
uh-huh and then hand backward hand plant backwards and then go forwards are you

936
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:07,140
are you demonstrating on cam even though it's only updates every 30 seconds

937
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:10,380
that's right I have a girl demonstrate in super slow

938
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:28,140
motion for these guys on cam. Hopefully we'll see something on cam. Sometimes I wish we

939
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:37,640
were a TV show, I really do. So that we could get booed by the Nilsons? Please, our ratings

940
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:43,200
couldn't be any worse than g4 tech TV come on oh my god when you're when

941
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:48,400
you're getting beat by the Golf Channel okay something's wrong you know tech TV

942
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:54,840
came up a conversation over lunch today how so the Soul Caliber dates Soul

943
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:58,280
Caliber dates they Dan was telling me about something they had on tech TV

944
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:02,320
where they had someone going on a blind date with Cervantes from Soul Caliber

945
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,920
What are you going to have for dinner?

946
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:07,520
I WANT YOUR SOUL!

947
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:13,040
We never had tech TV, it was G4 and then G4 basically assimilated tech TV.

948
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,040
This was G4 tech TV.

949
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:16,040
I didn't see it.

950
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:21,160
Alright, well you know what, if any G4 tech TV people are listening, as much as we give

951
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:28,040
you guys shit, we would sell our souls to you in a minute, so uh, call me.

952
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:29,040
Moving on.

953
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:30,040
I think now's a good time.

954
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:32,040
On that note, let's go to a break.

955
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:38,280
Alright, when we come back from break, I know Loki is dying over there to give a sim update.

956
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:42,860
We still want to talk about that other game, and we also want to get to the cage match.

957
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:44,620
We gotta do the cage match.

958
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:46,700
It's just not Orange on the Radio show without the cage match.

959
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:51,060
And for those of you guys that missed last week, you missed a real shocker in the cage

960
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:52,060
match.

961
01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:55,540
And we'll explain what's going on there when we come back from this break.

962
01:16:55,540 --> 01:17:01,140
And I figured maybe in this break, we could do some music that would remind us of the

963
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:10,500
good old days. So, let's start it off with... I'm looking, I'm looking to see if I can find

964
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:15,380
it. I think it's this one. We'll be right back after this, boys and girls. And everybody,

965
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:19,720
when you hear this song, practice. Get up off your chair and practice the move that

966
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:26,720
Islander was just showing you will be back

967
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:56,720
I need you more, never lose your way Only in my dreams, when I see you, they say

968
01:17:56,720 --> 01:18:05,720
I'll come back to me If you see that you love me, look, I'm talking

969
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:12,720
You give me a helping, all I can say I love what you're feeling, I love what you're dreaming

970
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:15,840
No one can bring me on to where I am

971
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:19,440
You've been young, baby, so close, yeah, close, yeah

972
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:23,200
So many, so many, who's here, who's here

973
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:26,720
Leave me on the high street, high street, high street

974
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:28,640
Let me be

975
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:34,000
So far out, I've been reduced to hope before you wade away

976
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,120
I need you now, metal is the way

977
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:42,320
Only in my dreams, when I see you looking, they all come back to me

978
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:46,320
This is so clear, so many good ears

979
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:49,320
We must go home dear, careful just to see ya

980
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:52,320
See you on my side, see the cow hide

981
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:56,320
Don't want to wait for the baby, watch the river

982
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:05,320
Dreamin', dreamin', groovin'

983
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:09,320
If you know what I mean, it's spookin' on the scene, alright

984
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:13,400
Make them come in, take the winin', make them movin' up with the Dancer King

985
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,240
What are they gonna do, what are they thinkin'?

986
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:21,280
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip on skank

987
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:23,020
Grind a yo's and up in the vine

988
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:25,020
To top around if your body have size

989
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:27,020
Now we have the size and shape and stamina

990
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:30,020
To make the party cool, the bubble and wine

991
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:31,020
Ratch it on my boy

992
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:36,720
Make them come in, take the winin', make them movin' up with the Dancer King

993
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:38,480
Until you diss, until you dance

994
01:20:38,480 --> 01:21:02,480
This morning I open my eyes and everything is still the same

995
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:06,480
I turned to the guy who was gay last night

996
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:11,480
I'm asking, what's your name?

997
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:14,480
She used to touch me more and more

998
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:18,480
I love those men one and all

999
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:22,480
Each new one of me makes my heart beat fast

1000
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:25,480
When I see them so strong and tall

1001
01:21:55,480 --> 01:22:02,480
With apologies to Iguana Girl, I can't resist this next one.

1002
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:28,920
Boys, boys, be my boy, and that I'm ready, honey

1003
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:33,080
Boys, boys, be my boy, I wanna be your lover, girl

1004
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:35,880
Be my lover, boy

1005
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:38,920
I've done my job, always thought that I'm a man

1006
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:41,960
I've got a magic in me, yeah

1007
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:45,960
I'm all around, still we're family paradise

1008
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:49,000
We cry to be the kids everywhere

1009
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:52,760
I'm just a girl, the clock has locked us all

1010
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:56,760
It's time to get something hot So come on, let's get hot

1011
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:59,760
But, boy, be my boy I wanna feel your body

1012
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:03,760
But, boy, be my boy Tonight I'm ready, honey

1013
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:07,760
But, boy, be my boy I wanna be your lover, girl

1014
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:10,760
Be my lover, boy

1015
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:20,760
But, boy, be my boy I wanna feel your body

1016
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:23,260
Honey, bud, bud, be my boy.

1017
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:26,740
Tonight I'm ready, honey, bud, bud, be my boy.

1018
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:29,740
I'm gonna be your lover, girl.

1019
01:23:29,740 --> 01:23:31,240
Be my lover, boy.

1020
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:43,720
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.

1021
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:45,180
Orange Lounge Radio.

1022
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:58,180
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio. Sorry, Jess, I just couldn't resist. But it's been like a good, like, what, four, three, four years since you heard it last, maybe?

1023
01:23:58,180 --> 01:24:05,180
Come on, so many memories, so little time. How can I choose?

1024
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:08,180
That's still the sluttiest song ever.

1025
01:24:08,180 --> 01:24:13,140
I'm being told F you in the chatroom. Thank you. Hey, we'll get to the F. He's a week a little later. All right

1026
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:20,800
She's not I'm I'm sorry

1027
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:23,660
I'm sorry. I

1028
01:24:23,700 --> 01:24:26,080
Sorry, I will we follow you

1029
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:31,080
She's typing messages. Oh, she says I'm not cute.

1030
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:44,080
She's only typing at me through text now.

1031
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:51,080
Oh, she's not even typing at me anymore. Forget it.

1032
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:55,520
going to move on with the show here. I'm actually waiting, I'm kind of hoping to hear from somebody

1033
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:59,680
on the Skype line in a couple minutes here. I open it up for a particular person to get

1034
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:06,140
through, which I'm hoping to hear from in just a second here. In the meantime, I thought

1035
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:11,940
maybe we would kind of start moving into the sim update for this week. I know Loki's got

1036
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:15,180
a lot he wants to say for the sim update, so I'll let him get started, but just keep

1037
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:18,020
in mind I might have to pick up a call midway through, sorry.

1038
01:25:18,020 --> 01:25:20,020
Thanks.

1039
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:23,460
Glad I'm, you know, top priority there.

1040
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:29,540
Anyways, um, yeah, this week there's a few things as opposed to the normal nothing.

1041
01:25:29,540 --> 01:25:34,300
Um, DDRUK still new, um, no new sim files.

1042
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:39,020
They're still waiting on beginner steps for, um, the Ultramix 2 stuff.

1043
01:25:39,020 --> 01:25:41,500
But it's close to being done, so that's good.

1044
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:50,500
Um, other than that, um, there's also a little theme that just got released on, uh, Bamai Cell right now, only because DDR Mania X is down,

1045
01:25:50,500 --> 01:26:00,500
and that theme would be Techno-Fiend 3. That's right, the most kick-ass skin ever for Step Mania has now released its final version of it, and, uh, it's awesome.

1046
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:06,500
Now, I don't even play Step Mania, really, and I know what Techno-Fiend is, okay? It's that good.

1047
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:11,660
good. Like, I really think the skin is great. I think it just, whoever did the work on that,

1048
01:26:11,660 --> 01:26:12,660
kudos to you.

1049
01:26:12,660 --> 01:26:17,740
It is the sexiest skin out there, and you gotta check it out. It's just, it's really

1050
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:23,180
awesome. Lots of humor and a little Easter eggster in the background there. But, um,

1051
01:26:23,180 --> 01:26:28,660
it's just, it's really nice looking. They've added, um, it's just completely redone almost,

1052
01:26:28,660 --> 01:26:35,140
and I don't know how to describe it. It's just very well put together, very, um, optimized,

1053
01:26:35,140 --> 01:26:42,140
and just runs really well. But yeah, you'll have to go check it out. It's kind of hard

1054
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:46,860
to find right now, only because, you know, DDR Maniacs is down. So what you need to do

1055
01:26:46,860 --> 01:26:54,340
is go to BamaiCell, go to their DDR sim file section there, and just do a search for Technofeen.

1056
01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:58,500
You'll find it probably, it's actually on the second or third page on there right now,

1057
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:04,660
and you should find it to download it and it's awesome. It's a good 14 megs but um...

1058
01:27:04,660 --> 01:27:07,920
it is a really good sim... um... skin.

1059
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:09,580
Um... other than that

1060
01:27:09,580 --> 01:27:10,860
uh... there's also

1061
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:13,060
what was it the um...

1062
01:27:13,060 --> 01:27:17,540
OSC3 Plus Remix which is um...

1063
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:20,820
the Stepfile contest where they had all the you know

1064
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:25,260
basically songs where they're taking new steps or they're being remixed or whatever.

1065
01:27:25,260 --> 01:27:43,260
That's available for download also on BamaiStyle, and they also have their own download pack that's available right now, which is, I think, a couple more sim files, and it's, uh, DDR5 Key Classics is the, um, theme for this one, so check those out over there as well.

1066
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:45,260
And that's all.

1067
01:27:46,260 --> 01:27:53,260
Okay, for those that don't really know what Technofeam is all about, what exactly makes this skin so damn cool?

1068
01:27:53,260 --> 01:28:07,260
It's just sexy, that's all it is. It's just very, you know, the interface is very well done and it just doesn't look like DDR. It looks really cool. I can't really describe it, you just have to go download it and check it out.

1069
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:26,260
It's kind of like, I want to say Star Wars because it has a lot of Star Wars parodies in it, but not really. I mean, it's just very different. It makes DDR all futuristic. It makes it feel like a 2010 game or something, you know. It just gives it a very futuristic theme to it. That would be the way I would put it. And it's sexy.

1070
01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:45,260
Yes, that'd probably be a way. It looks like what a new, if they were to reinvent DDR and release it now, what it would look like. Well, maybe not. Because, you know, if they were to, you know, spend the amount of time that they did on, like, finding good music with designing the interface, this is what it'd look like.

1071
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:49,260
Alright. Any comments from anybody else about Techno-Fiend? I know-

1072
01:28:50,260 --> 01:28:51,260
It was purdy.

1073
01:28:51,260 --> 01:28:52,260
You saw a little bit of it?

1074
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:53,260
It was purdy.

1075
01:28:53,260 --> 01:28:54,260
Yeah, very pretty.

1076
01:28:54,260 --> 01:28:55,760
very pretty

1077
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:56,620
and it

1078
01:28:56,620 --> 01:28:58,260
jazz felt excited

1079
01:28:58,260 --> 01:29:00,260
you've used this technofeen before yes

1080
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:05,740
not yet the first time i've seen it but i'm definitely going to download it when i get back to walnut creek today

1081
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:06,480
it's sexy

1082
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:10,380
oh yeah it's sexy

1083
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:14,180
um... what now i guess we're gonna go ahead and get into the cage match and we'll come

1084
01:29:14,180 --> 01:29:15,380
back and hopefully that

1085
01:29:15,380 --> 01:29:18,180
call we can get to and then

1086
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:19,900
the new game, we're talking about the new game now

1087
01:29:19,900 --> 01:29:22,900
I know, I keep putting it off. Alright, let's talk about the new game now. Let's talk about the new game.

1088
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:27,900
Um, so I finally got to check out this game for the PlayStation 2, thanks to

1089
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:32,900
Islander and Iguana Girl bringing it over for me. It's called Technic Beat.

1090
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:35,900
And this game's actually been out for like two months, right? It's been out a little while.

1091
01:29:35,900 --> 01:29:39,900
But I'm just now getting to see it, because I somehow completely missed this game.

1092
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:44,900
I heard about it like a month ago, but I'd really missed it somehow.

1093
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:47,900
Um, you're pretty familiar with this game, right Jess?

1094
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:48,900
Yeah.

1095
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:50,300
Tell us about how this game works.

1096
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:54,460
Well, the way this game works is very interesting.

1097
01:29:54,460 --> 01:30:00,100
Basically, you choose a character and you start walking around on a kind of liquidy

1098
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:06,540
type surface, and then circles will appear, and then little circles will appear coming

1099
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:07,540
from it.

1100
01:30:07,540 --> 01:30:13,780
And if you think of the big circles as like guide arrows in DDR, and the little circles

1101
01:30:13,780 --> 01:30:19,140
coming out towards the other circle like the actual arrows then that's what it's

1102
01:30:19,140 --> 01:30:23,840
kind of like it's basically you want to hit the ripples right so basically you

1103
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:27,300
have a little character you start riding around start hitting the ripples and the

1104
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:31,220
game is full of a bunch of Namco original songs like old-school Namco

1105
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:36,700
stuff like Thema Daruga and Pacmania Pacmania which is awesome

1106
01:30:36,700 --> 01:30:41,540
Dig Dug even Point Blank but now there's kind of a tie into Bamani isn't there

1107
01:30:41,540 --> 01:30:47,900
here? A little bit, yes, because basically the whole game is done by Sampling Masters,

1108
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:53,460
Aya and Mega, which are of Rotel da Moon, I mean, Rotel da Sun, Rotel da Mercury, blah

1109
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:57,260
blah blah, stuff like that, and they even have a Routine da Moon song, which is completely

1110
01:30:57,260 --> 01:31:02,560
awesome in the game. Okay. So if you're a fan of that music in 2DX, you probably should

1111
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:07,120
check out this Technic Beat, because they did all the music. And that Pac-Mania song

1112
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:10,620
that I heard you play was awesome. That was good. And that was by Sampling Masters, Mega,

1113
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:12,620
One of the two. One of the two.

1114
01:31:12,620 --> 01:31:14,620
Alright. Good stuff.

1115
01:31:14,620 --> 01:31:16,620
It was a little...

1116
01:31:16,620 --> 01:31:18,620
It was different though. It was very different

1117
01:31:18,620 --> 01:31:20,620
compared to other music games I've played lately.

1118
01:31:20,620 --> 01:31:22,620
Which is good though. I think they need to get away

1119
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:24,620
from the moving

1120
01:31:24,620 --> 01:31:26,620
moving thing towards

1121
01:31:26,620 --> 01:31:28,620
the line and stuff. You know, every

1122
01:31:28,620 --> 01:31:30,620
game is starting to look like DDR.

1123
01:31:30,620 --> 01:31:32,620
It's a lot more obscure. And that's what I like about it.

1124
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:34,620
Because it has you... Yeah, like you said

1125
01:31:34,620 --> 01:31:36,620
a lot of things are basically, wait for it to

1126
01:31:36,620 --> 01:31:38,620
get to this screen. Okay.

1127
01:31:38,620 --> 01:31:43,620
This one you have to run around, and some characters can't run fast.

1128
01:31:43,620 --> 01:31:48,620
And you have to kick the notes around sometimes, and then depending on which note you hit,

1129
01:31:48,620 --> 01:31:52,620
you'll actually kind of change the pitch of the music, which is pretty cool, I think.

1130
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:55,620
It's kind of fun to sometimes play it, and you get to remix your own a little bit.

1131
01:31:55,620 --> 01:31:58,620
Kind of like Amplitude allows you to do, in a way.

1132
01:31:58,620 --> 01:32:01,620
You can even have a remix mode in the game where you can make your own stuff.

1133
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:04,620
And there looked to be a lot of modes in Technic Beat.

1134
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:07,620
I didn't really get to play with a lot of the others. Have you checked out some of the other modes?

1135
01:32:07,620 --> 01:32:12,620
Basically, it's basically the normal stuff they have, like non-stop mode is in there,

1136
01:32:12,620 --> 01:32:16,620
free mode, like 2DX is in free mode after you play a song, it's unlocked in free mode.

1137
01:32:16,620 --> 01:32:21,620
Which is hard because there's not really a way to keep track of the songs you've passed

1138
01:32:21,620 --> 01:32:25,620
in regular game mode, so you're kind of guessing which ones you've passed already in free mode.

1139
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:29,620
Then you go back and check, oh, that's unlocked, yay, oh, that's, nah.

1140
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:35,620
So, yeah, it gets a little annoying, but still it's a great game because it has about 80 songs.

1141
01:32:35,620 --> 01:32:40,980
and it's only twenty dollars. Yeah, it's one of these budget games, like

1142
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:44,260
it's kind of, Namco did this one right? Yeah. So

1143
01:32:44,260 --> 01:32:47,540
that... No, it was a Mastiff

1144
01:32:47,540 --> 01:32:51,020
and a Rika, which are basically a branch off of Namco. Okay.

1145
01:32:51,020 --> 01:32:54,740
But Katamari Damacyu was also by Namco, and I think these two games came out

1146
01:32:54,740 --> 01:32:58,460
together, actually, didn't they? Around?

1147
01:32:58,460 --> 01:33:03,100
It came out in the same manner, like it wasn't released that much because they

1148
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:05,060
didn't think there were going to be a high demand for it.

1149
01:33:05,060 --> 01:33:08,140
And there hasn't been, so it's kind of like, eh.

1150
01:33:08,140 --> 01:33:09,700
At least for Technic Beat there hasn't been.

1151
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:12,940
Now Katamari Damacy, they probably thought the same thing going into it, but boy were

1152
01:33:12,940 --> 01:33:13,940
they wrong.

1153
01:33:13,940 --> 01:33:14,940
Oh yeah.

1154
01:33:14,940 --> 01:33:19,500
So, and I, but Technic Beat, and we've got a lot of folks in our town saying they never

1155
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:20,500
even heard of this game.

1156
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:21,500
Yeah.

1157
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:24,940
So, and it's not, you know, not surprising at all, but it is a new music rhythm game

1158
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:27,420
that's out there, and it's kind of different the way it works.

1159
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:31,380
You're not gonna know, a lot of the songs in there are gonna be unfamiliar to you unless

1160
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:34,200
you play a lot of old school 80s arcade games.

1161
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:39,440
If you're a mame whore, like you're a mame whore, you've got that multi-arcade machine

1162
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:40,440
emulator?

1163
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:41,440
That is exactly it.

1164
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:43,680
Oh, I remembered.

1165
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:49,140
If you've got that on your computer, and you have all these ROMs from crazy places of games

1166
01:33:49,140 --> 01:33:52,200
you've never heard of, which you're not supposed to do, because that's illegal, boys and girls,

1167
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:55,120
and I'm not encouraging you to do that, I'm just saying if you've already done it, then

1168
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:58,080
you probably are familiar with a lot of these old games, and they've remixed a lot of these

1169
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:00,120
old games, which is cool.

1170
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:01,120
Yeah.

1171
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:03,020
So, check it out!

1172
01:34:03,020 --> 01:34:04,020
It's only 20 bucks.

1173
01:34:04,020 --> 01:34:05,020
Yeah.

1174
01:34:05,020 --> 01:34:09,660
So, wow, this will be a great opportunity to sell it on our website, but we just, you

1175
01:34:09,660 --> 01:34:12,300
know, we're not that smart.

1176
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:13,300
Cry.

1177
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:14,500
Oh well.

1178
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:19,820
I did see that game while I was Christmas shopping, and the first thing I thought was,

1179
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:22,760
ooh, should I get that for, no, what if it sucks?

1180
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:28,100
But now I know, so I might just have to like go down and get it tomorrow.

1181
01:34:28,100 --> 01:34:32,940
Now speaking of music games that suck, I know, Islander, you got a chance to play one not

1182
01:34:32,940 --> 01:34:36,680
too long ago, right?

1183
01:34:36,680 --> 01:34:38,220
Music games that suck?

1184
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:39,220
Yeah.

1185
01:34:39,220 --> 01:34:41,900
One not too long ago.

1186
01:34:41,900 --> 01:34:43,140
Oh, Jesus Christ!

1187
01:34:43,140 --> 01:34:47,120
Let me give you a hint, let me give you a hint.

1188
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:52,180
All those people complaining about GameCube DDR, there's something out there for you.

1189
01:34:52,180 --> 01:34:55,580
And really, you're not missing out.

1190
01:34:55,580 --> 01:35:01,780
It's by MadCats, who, you know, for a long time have been making third-party controllers

1191
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:08,820
and such, and memory cards and other various accessories, but this being their first game,

1192
01:35:08,820 --> 01:35:09,820
it was lacking.

1193
01:35:09,820 --> 01:35:10,820
Boy, was it lacking.

1194
01:35:10,820 --> 01:35:12,300
That's putting it lightly.

1195
01:35:12,300 --> 01:35:13,300
Oh, yes.

1196
01:35:13,300 --> 01:35:14,300
Very lightly.

1197
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:15,780
It was a pile of steaming poopie.

1198
01:35:15,780 --> 01:35:17,780
Well, yeah.

1199
01:35:17,780 --> 01:35:21,540
The one saving grace was that the soundtrack wasn't bad.

1200
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:27,820
I liked a lot of the music in there, but dear lord, do I really like to play the full length

1201
01:35:27,820 --> 01:35:30,980
five minute version of Parents Just Don't Understand on eight arrows?

1202
01:35:30,980 --> 01:35:32,980
Do I really need to do this?

1203
01:35:32,980 --> 01:35:34,740
Do the arrows even make any sense?

1204
01:35:34,740 --> 01:35:35,740
Like do they...

1205
01:35:35,740 --> 01:35:36,740
They're...

1206
01:35:36,740 --> 01:35:37,740
Okay, imagine...

1207
01:35:37,740 --> 01:35:41,380
Okay, now we were just discussing Technic Beat, how it has a circle and another circle

1208
01:35:41,380 --> 01:35:43,700
that comes out to meet it.

1209
01:35:43,700 --> 01:35:47,180
Your arrows are set up in a circular manner.

1210
01:35:47,180 --> 01:35:50,060
You have up, down, left, right and the four diagonals.

1211
01:35:50,060 --> 01:35:55,060
and the arrows appear from the center and move outward.

1212
01:35:55,060 --> 01:35:57,060
It's very strange looking.

1213
01:35:57,060 --> 01:35:59,060
Which is confusing to begin with, a setup like that.

1214
01:35:59,060 --> 01:36:06,060
Another option is the scroll mode, which turns it into DDR, but up and down are switched.

1215
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:10,060
And that was really confusing too.

1216
01:36:10,060 --> 01:36:12,060
Yeah, exactly.

1217
01:36:12,060 --> 01:36:16,060
That was like just uhhhh, I'm not...

1218
01:36:16,060 --> 01:36:18,060
Damnit

1219
01:36:19,780 --> 01:36:24,260
Wow, it's it was it was real bad as a matter of fact, I played it for about maybe 30 minutes

1220
01:36:25,620 --> 01:36:27,980
Looked at you want a girl and said this is a piece of crap

1221
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:33,260
Threw it back in the box and went back to GameStop or yeah GameStop the very next day and said, you know

1222
01:36:33,260 --> 01:36:37,100
What let me get a game that like is actually cool. Can I try this in for Mario Party 6?

1223
01:36:38,620 --> 01:36:40,620
and

1224
01:36:40,620 --> 01:36:43,900
It was and sure enough I was able to do that and get some money

1225
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:47,100
being reimbursed to me, and I was very happy about that.

1226
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:50,340
And that's a good thing that you got Mario Party 6 out of it, because, you know, otherwise

1227
01:36:50,340 --> 01:36:53,300
we wouldn't have had that on New Year's, and that was a lot of fun to play, so...

1228
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:55,300
Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.

1229
01:36:55,300 --> 01:36:56,300
All right.

1230
01:36:56,300 --> 01:37:02,300
But, boy, please, people, stay away from MC Groove's dance craze, please.

1231
01:37:02,300 --> 01:37:05,800
I mean, the only reason I'd buy it is if it was, like, 20 bucks.

1232
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:06,800
How much was it?

1233
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:09,260
At the time, 60.

1234
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:11,380
Right now, it's going for 50.

1235
01:37:11,380 --> 01:37:13,260
You've gotta be kidding me, 50 bucks?

1236
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:14,260
Does it come with a pad or something?

1237
01:37:14,260 --> 01:37:15,260
Yeah.

1238
01:37:15,260 --> 01:37:16,260
It comes with a pad and a pad.

1239
01:37:16,260 --> 01:37:17,260
Okay, but still!

1240
01:37:17,260 --> 01:37:18,260
Yeah, exactly.

1241
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:19,260
Ooh.

1242
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:20,260
God.

1243
01:37:20,260 --> 01:37:21,260
Oh, it was horrible.

1244
01:37:21,260 --> 01:37:22,260
But even the Mad Cat's pad wouldn't even be worth $50.

1245
01:37:22,260 --> 01:37:23,260
It sucks.

1246
01:37:23,260 --> 01:37:30,080
I mean, it actually worked well, but I was like, ugh, just, ugh, it's just bad.

1247
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:31,080
People stay away, please.

1248
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:32,080
Get on the Mind?

1249
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:33,080
Ooh.

1250
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:40,640
That was one of the games we picked up, basically because we have Carrier Revolution Volume

1251
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:46,240
And we wanted to play duets with like two mics. So I bought I bought get on the mic for the second mic

1252
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:51,820
The game itself is actually pretty interesting. It uses a lot of I mean, of course, it's it's all hip-hop

1253
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:54,620
But it ranges from stuff like the newer stuff

1254
01:37:56,520 --> 01:38:03,640
Gosh like turn it up and some other strange things or like party up DMX to like old-school stuff like Humpty dance and

1255
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:09,920
and and and and the characters are just hilarious because like there's this one

1256
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:13,820
stage where you're just starting out your career and you're in your bathroom

1257
01:38:13,820 --> 01:38:17,360
looking at yourself in the mirror trying to be all hardcore. Wasn't that a scene in

1258
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:22,940
8 Mile? Yeah, basically. It's funny because like your your boombox is on the

1259
01:38:22,940 --> 01:38:26,900
shelf and it's like bouncing and it's and like if you're doing well the whole

1260
01:38:26,900 --> 01:38:33,560
room starts like like bouncing and having fun. Yeah, pretty much. And it's

1261
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:37,900
like Parappa's bathroom level. Basically, there you go. There you go.

1262
01:38:37,900 --> 01:38:43,500
He's not rapping about having to go to the bathroom. No, but like perhaps honestly my favorite song in that game. I know I know

1263
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:49,220
It's a great song in there may know in the snow. I got that really gotta go

1264
01:38:56,580 --> 01:38:58,580
I made me laugh so hard. I peed a little

1265
01:39:00,700 --> 01:39:04,020
Yeah, all right, please stay away from as he can't then see Cruz dance craze, please

1266
01:39:04,020 --> 01:39:09,860
I got to check out a little bit of Donkey Konga this week because one of my buddies

1267
01:39:09,860 --> 01:39:12,580
got it for Christmas and he said, you have to play it, you have to play it.

1268
01:39:12,580 --> 01:39:14,940
So he brought it over, kind of like how you guys brought it over a couple weeks ago, but

1269
01:39:14,940 --> 01:39:17,820
this time I actually had time to play it.

1270
01:39:17,820 --> 01:39:21,380
I feel bad because you guys brought those games, we didn't even really get to them.

1271
01:39:21,380 --> 01:39:26,740
But not to play a little more Donkey Konga, now I'd seen it at E3, and really the game

1272
01:39:26,740 --> 01:39:30,640
was pretty much what I remembered at E3, there wasn't a whole lot different, but it's just,

1273
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:31,640
it's fun.

1274
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:32,640
It really is.

1275
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:36,740
game there's some songs in there that are really freaking cute like there's a

1276
01:39:36,740 --> 01:39:41,980
cover of I think I love you so what am I so afraid but it's all like happy

1277
01:39:41,980 --> 01:39:46,180
Britney style kind of but not not like Britney bad but like you know yeah but

1278
01:39:46,180 --> 01:39:49,580
it has that like a cute Nazi feel to it it does and we got to get some of those

1279
01:39:49,580 --> 01:39:51,500
songs and get them on orange on this radio because there's some really cute

1280
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:56,700
docu conga songs but then there's some like really really like okay this game

1281
01:39:56,700 --> 01:40:01,300
is obviously for five-year-old songs because there's like the campfire medley

1282
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:08,300
There was a Foster's Medley in Taiko Drum Master 2, and I'm like, what the hell is this?

1283
01:40:08,300 --> 01:40:15,300
I came this close to picking up Taiko Drum Master today. I saw it sitting on the shelf, and I was like, it's calling my name.

1284
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:16,300
Get it, get it.

1285
01:40:16,300 --> 01:40:21,300
But then I was like, must save money for something else.

1286
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:27,300
I want that game. But I still want a freaking second pair of maracas.

1287
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:30,300
They stopped making Samba de Amigo like three years ago.

1288
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:32,300
I wanted them to bring out the tambourine one.

1289
01:40:32,300 --> 01:40:34,300
Seriously, the tambourine game?

1290
01:40:34,300 --> 01:40:36,300
I would be all over the freaking tambourine game.

1291
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:38,300
This coming from somebody who has played

1292
01:40:38,300 --> 01:40:40,300
Dance Dance Revolution,

1293
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:42,300
Para Para Paradise,

1294
01:40:42,300 --> 01:40:44,300
I've played just about

1295
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:46,300
almost every music

1296
01:40:46,300 --> 01:40:48,300
game out there.

1297
01:40:48,300 --> 01:40:50,300
The tambourine game did come out.

1298
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:52,300
The tambourine game is the gayest

1299
01:40:52,300 --> 01:40:54,300
music game I've ever played.

1300
01:40:54,300 --> 01:40:56,300
I don't care, I'm a chick, I can get away with it.

1301
01:40:56,300 --> 01:40:58,300
You can, but I'm just saying.

1302
01:40:58,300 --> 01:41:03,880
You think Para Para is bad? Play the, what's the tambourine game called? Tambourine something.

1303
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:08,080
Tambourine something. I'll find out the name. Wow. Give me a sec, I'll find out the name.

1304
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:15,080
Alright. Mr. Tambourine Man. Mr. Tambourine Haynes. Yeah, but nothing like those fifteen

1305
01:41:15,140 --> 01:41:19,860
pound samba controllers. Dear lord. Samba was such a fun game though, it's such a pity.

1306
01:41:19,860 --> 01:41:23,420
Wasn't it? Well, you know it's gonna have a little revival because the itoy thing, the

1307
01:41:23,420 --> 01:41:27,640
Sega itoy is gonna have a samba minigame in it. But man, it was just fun for those random

1308
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:33,680
composers you have to do those are always great which which which reminds

1309
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:41,480
me Jamie Samba on iToy travesty or best thing ever I hate the iToy so travesty

1310
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:49,040
all right just curious all right all right yeah how about that cage match how

1311
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:54,600
about that cage match let's get into the cage match we're gonna get into it here

1312
01:41:54,600 --> 01:42:01,760
Alright, last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, we were missing a host, so we

1313
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:04,360
didn't get a song, because Jamie was out sick.

1314
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:05,360
Got the name.

1315
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:06,360
Oh.

1316
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:07,360
Chacato Tambourine, I think.

1317
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:08,360
Oh.

1318
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:10,360
So, what, shake that tambourine, basically?

1319
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:11,360
Basically.

1320
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:12,360
Alright.

1321
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:17,440
Anyway, we were down a host last week, so we let you guys, the listeners, do something

1322
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:25,180
you have been begging us to do for years now and that is a chat room choice song

1323
01:42:25,180 --> 01:42:30,100
for the cage match so we let a random chat room listener which was I believe

1324
01:42:30,100 --> 01:42:32,940
it was big red pimp ended up picking this right and angel you helped them

1325
01:42:32,940 --> 01:42:38,020
find it or something well no actually he already had it and he told me what it

1326
01:42:38,020 --> 01:42:44,060
was over private message I'm like oh that's cool all right so we had

1327
01:42:44,060 --> 01:42:47,140
everybody in the chat room submit a random entry and we picked one at random

1328
01:42:47,140 --> 01:42:51,700
And it was this one and sure enough you let the chat room put a song in the cage match and of course

1329
01:42:51,700 --> 01:42:53,700
They're gonna vote for it. So that's on one. Oh

1330
01:42:56,260 --> 01:42:58,260
I thought you had a comment. So

1331
01:42:58,380 --> 01:43:04,740
What that means is that cage match is all screwed up now because we have a chat room choice sitting there in the cage match

1332
01:43:04,740 --> 01:43:07,860
So what we're gonna do is know what we're gonna do is this

1333
01:43:08,460 --> 01:43:11,700
Since Jamie stepped aside last week for the chat room choice

1334
01:43:11,700 --> 01:43:16,220
I will step aside this week so the chat room choice can be in and if for whatever reason it wins again

1335
01:43:16,220 --> 01:43:17,220
again.

1336
01:43:17,220 --> 01:43:18,220
Loki will be out next week.

1337
01:43:18,220 --> 01:43:19,220
Okay?

1338
01:43:19,220 --> 01:43:21,380
That means you just didn't want to pick a song this week?

1339
01:43:21,380 --> 01:43:23,340
No, because I have a good song.

1340
01:43:23,340 --> 01:43:26,340
I have a good song, but I just, I'm going to step aside this week.

1341
01:43:26,340 --> 01:43:28,180
Did you listen, by the way, at my suggestion?

1342
01:43:28,180 --> 01:43:29,180
I haven't had a chance to.

1343
01:43:29,180 --> 01:43:31,220
I'm going to hear it for the first time tonight, so we'll see.

1344
01:43:31,220 --> 01:43:32,620
Alright, here we go.

1345
01:43:32,620 --> 01:43:37,220
So song number one, last week's winner, is a group, you guys know this one if you listen

1346
01:43:37,220 --> 01:43:42,100
to any J-Rock, Lark and Seal did this song, and the song is called Ready Steady Go, and

1347
01:43:42,100 --> 01:43:45,740
no, it's not anything like the Paul Logan fold one, okay?

1348
01:43:45,740 --> 01:43:50,060
Alright so again the way the cage match works we play three songs for your listening pleasure

1349
01:43:50,060 --> 01:43:51,380
or displeasure.

1350
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:55,080
You pick your favorite and your favorite song goes into rotation all week long on Orange

1351
01:43:55,080 --> 01:43:59,300
Lawns Radio's Hermione Music and More program which runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on

1352
01:43:59,300 --> 01:44:01,420
the station when we're not live.

1353
01:44:01,420 --> 01:44:06,880
Alright so here it is, oh and remember you gotta be in our chat room to participate so

1355
01:44:11,700 --> 01:44:19,380
Alright, that being said, here it is. Song number one, a clip, because it won last week, so you already know what it sounds like. A clip of Lark and Seal. Ready, steady, go.

1356
01:45:41,700 --> 01:46:01,260
Alright, that was song number one in tonight's cage match, the chat room choice, which I'm

1357
01:46:01,260 --> 01:46:06,300
stepping aside for, is that that song can continue to stay in cage match until it gets

1358
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:07,300
voted out.

1359
01:46:07,300 --> 01:46:11,300
That's Lark and Seal with Ready Steady Go and so let's get into tonight's two

1360
01:46:11,300 --> 01:46:14,440
challengers that will be battling that song.

1361
01:46:14,440 --> 01:46:18,300
Well I just have to make one comment since I wasn't here last week.

1362
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:21,480
I do really like Lark and Seal.

1363
01:46:21,480 --> 01:46:25,700
I don't like that as the opening theme for SMA.

1364
01:46:25,700 --> 01:46:28,900
Lark and Seal's done a lot better.

1365
01:46:28,900 --> 01:46:32,340
A lot better. Since Jamie didn't get to make her comment last week, there you go.

1366
01:46:32,340 --> 01:46:34,220
On a scale of one to ten.

1367
01:46:34,220 --> 01:46:37,220
It's a seven. I mean, it's a good song. Don't get me wrong. It's just...

1368
01:46:37,220 --> 01:46:42,920
And I should like the opening sequence for FMA, but it just doesn't fit. It doesn't fit.

1369
01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:49,720
Let me put it this way. I was really scared when we were opening it up to a random chatroom song of what we were gonna get.

1370
01:46:49,720 --> 01:46:53,920
It could have been a lot worse. It could have been a lot worse.

1371
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:56,920
So, chatroom did okay on that one, so I'm not gonna complain.

1372
01:46:56,920 --> 01:47:03,920
Alright, here we go. Song number two tonight is gonna come to us from Loki. And, uh, Loki, what are you picking tonight?

1373
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:25,920
I'm picking, uh, first I found the remix album, then I found the original CD, but this is from a group that's calling themselves ProdigyRemix.com, and it's actually a group of about four different, um, remixers that completely remixed the brand new album from Prodigy, um, which is always outnumbered and never outgunned.

1374
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:35,400
This one is Always Outsiders, Never Outdone, and this is their track Girls, which is Girls

1375
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:41,840
the Idiotek Remix, which is pretty interesting, it's just a strange song.

1376
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:46,120
Alright Loki says strange song, we will find out, is the cage match worthy?

1377
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:53,120
We'll find out. This is ProdigyRemix.com with girls, the Idiotek remix. Enjoy!

1378
01:48:46,120 --> 01:49:10,440
It will be a mission now It will be a mission now

1379
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:13,740
Speed it up, it hydraulic speed, pour a EVs

1380

Speed it up, it hydraulic speed, pour a EVs

1381

Speed it up, it hydraulic speed, pour a EVs

1382
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:20,680
Speed it up, it hydraulic speed, pour a EVs

1383
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:24,140
Speed it up, it hydraulic speed, pour a EVs

1384
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:24,340
Speed it up, it hydraulic speed, pour a EVs

1385
01:49:24,440 --> 01:49:26,700
Speed it up, it hydraulic speed, pour a EVs

1386
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:26,940
Speed it up, it hydraulic speed, pour a EVs

1387
01:49:26,440 --> 01:49:26,900
Speed it up, it hydraulic speed, pour a EVs

1388
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:29,700
Speed it up, it hydraulic speed, pour a EVs

1389
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:31,700
Speed it up, it hydraulic speed, pour a EVs

1390
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:34,240
Speed it up, it hydraulic speed, pour a EVs

1391

Speed it up, it hydraulic speed, pour a EVs

1392

Speed it up, it hydraulic speed, pour a EVs

1393
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:38,800
Speed it up, it hydraulic speed, pour a EVs

1394
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:41,660
I'm going to go look at all the young girls

1395
01:49:41,660 --> 01:49:42,680
Who's your last one?

1396
01:49:42,680 --> 01:49:43,800
Who's the end?

1397
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:45,140
I'm gonna catch you later

1398
01:49:45,140 --> 01:49:48,520
I'm going to go look at all the young girls

1399
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:50,520
Oh

1400
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:50,520
Oh

1401
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:20,520
Oh

1402
01:52:48,520 --> 01:53:12,760
Okay, I just want to preface, before we judge the song, I want to preface with this.

1403
01:53:12,760 --> 01:53:16,600
We've been doing the cage match for about two years now.

1404
01:53:16,600 --> 01:53:21,960
I have been waiting that entire two years for a moment like this.

1405
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:26,280
That being said, Jamie, what did you think of that?

1406
01:53:26,280 --> 01:53:28,200
It stopped!

1407
01:53:28,200 --> 01:53:29,440
Zero!

1408
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:33,400
Islander, negative two.

1409
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:34,400
Jazz.

1410
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:35,400
Girl.

1411
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:36,400
Girl.

1412
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:39,400
You don't like girls.

1413
01:53:39,400 --> 01:53:40,400
Zero.

1414
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:44,580
I want a girl.

1415
01:53:44,580 --> 01:53:51,580
That was something from Prodigy?

1416
01:53:52,360 --> 01:53:55,500
Oh, I was waiting for a number, I'm sorry.

1417
01:53:55,500 --> 01:53:57,380
Zero. Oh, okay.

1418
01:53:57,380 --> 01:53:59,880
Uh, Loki!

1419
01:53:59,880 --> 01:54:01,380
You know,

1420
01:54:01,380 --> 01:54:06,020
what's sad is that this remixed version was better than the original.

1421
01:54:06,020 --> 01:54:08,380
That's the worst part of it.

1422
01:54:08,380 --> 01:54:11,740
You know what? I just picked a song because I had nothing else.

1423
01:54:11,740 --> 01:54:13,420
Next week is when I'll have the good stuff.

1424
01:54:13,420 --> 01:54:17,860
That's what I was trying to download, but, you know,

1425
01:54:17,860 --> 01:54:20,880
I just found it too late, so, it's alright.

1426
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:25,660
But, uh, I give it a zero just to go with everyone else.

1427
01:54:25,660 --> 01:54:26,940
Um,

1428
01:54:26,940 --> 01:54:28,820
you know what?

1429
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:33,060
Loki, after all the shitty songs I've put in the cage match, cause there's been a

1430
01:54:33,060 --> 01:54:38,420
few, I'm really glad that it's not just me. Zero, Angel.

1431
01:54:38,420 --> 01:54:40,880
Um, negative 999, that's all.

1432
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:43,880
Oh my god, she didn't do something nice!

1433
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:47,880
Holy crap, you've given the tennis some really bad stuff!

1434
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:53,880
I mean, I'm not meaning this in a mean way, but...

1435
01:54:53,880 --> 01:54:55,880
I'm surprised!

1436
01:54:55,880 --> 01:54:59,880
Yeah, uh... I don't know.

1437
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:00,880
I, I...

1438
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:05,880
We'll remind you though, your singing actually did get voted in for, uh...

1439
01:55:05,880 --> 01:55:07,880
For the weekly pick, so...

1440
01:55:07,880 --> 01:55:08,880
If?

1441
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:11,680
Yeah, I think your singing is better than girls.

1442
01:55:11,680 --> 01:55:12,960
I would like to point this out.

1443
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:14,800
Girls, girls, girls, girls.

1444
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:18,080
Loki, Loki now can attest to this.

1445
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:21,920
This is the first time a song has ever been put in the cage match

1446
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:26,960
and gotten zeroes from every single judge, including the one who put it in.

1447
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:30,500
Wow.

1448
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:33,360
We have orange elves history tonight.

1449
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:37,200
I think we've had one where I put it in and everybody else gave it a zero,

1450
01:55:37,200 --> 01:55:40,600
But I gave it a hundred to balance it out. I don't remember what song it was

1451
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:44,880
I know it. I know I've been there, but remember you know what our opinion sucks

1452
01:55:45,320 --> 01:55:49,800
Will the chat room vote it in just to be funny and let me tell you that would not be funny

1453
01:55:50,600 --> 01:55:52,960
We'll find out because it's really up to the chat room

1454
01:55:53,960 --> 01:55:55,960
Jamie

1455
01:55:56,520 --> 01:55:58,280
Yeah, that's right you'd have to listen to all week

1456
01:55:58,280 --> 01:56:02,320
And you would have to hear it again next week, and I'll play a long clip of that song next week

1457
01:56:09,320 --> 01:56:13,380
Like why are you giving the chairman ultimatum? You know they're gonna be mean right back at us

1458
01:56:14,160 --> 01:56:17,800
Love you chat room that being said let's give them another option Jamie. I

1459
01:56:18,520 --> 01:56:20,400
Forgot who it is that did this again

1460
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:25,960
But there was a song and I think I really do think that this is one that I had on a tape that I bought

1461
01:56:25,960 --> 01:56:30,960
I got it The Limited back when I was in my senior year of high school, taking French.

1462
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:32,960
And I bought the CD, the tape, because it was all in French.

1463
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:35,960
I was like, oh cool, I can use it to, you know, practice.

1464
01:56:35,960 --> 01:56:40,960
It's a song called Jola Taxi that I really liked.

1465
01:56:40,960 --> 01:56:44,960
I mean, it was a cute song, and I was looking for it and found a remix of it.

1466
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:48,960
And this has actually been sort of edging me back into trance, believe it or not.

1467
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:51,960
So this is a trance mix of Jola Taxi.

1468
01:56:51,960 --> 01:56:55,960
Alright, now the full name of this is huge, so I'm only going to read it once, kids. Here it is.

1469
01:56:55,960 --> 01:57:03,960
The artist, Aria Posey, and the song, Joe Lataxi, and it's the Jan Wayne remix radio cut.

1470
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:05,960
Okay?

1471
01:57:05,960 --> 01:57:06,960
Wow, that's pretty damn long.

1472
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:08,960
Here it is, song number 3, enjoy!

1473
02:00:36,960 --> 02:00:51,040
All right, let's see what everybody thought about song number three.

1474
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:53,720
We'll just call it Joe La Taxi for short.

1475
02:00:53,720 --> 02:00:54,720
Jamie?

1476
02:00:54,720 --> 02:00:57,440
I've just been listening to that song on repeat.

1477
02:00:57,440 --> 02:00:58,440
I mean, actually, it was...

1478
02:00:58,440 --> 02:01:03,560
I was listening to it earlier today just trying to keep myself in a good mood, and I give

1479
02:01:03,560 --> 02:01:04,560
it a nine.

1480
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:08,540
I like I'm still not quite my chance, but it had to have a couple of slightly

1481
02:01:08,980 --> 02:01:13,100
Overly trancy annoying things in it, but overall it's such a good song and I like the original

1482
02:01:13,800 --> 02:01:17,680
Okay, did you want to get your thought in before you head off? Okay. All right, Jess. I

1483
02:01:18,200 --> 02:01:19,560
Thought it was okay

1484
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:25,880
It seems very kind of Jay trancy to me like something at UMI would do a lot to me and that's okay

1485
02:01:25,880 --> 02:01:28,440
But I don't know it got a little too trancy for me

1486
02:01:28,440 --> 02:01:32,440
Just giving it generic termsy for me, but it was still good, so I'd give it like a 7.

1487
02:01:35,440 --> 02:01:37,440
You know, that was actually the same score I was gonna give it myself.

1488
02:01:38,440 --> 02:01:41,440
I did like it a lot, and I liked it a lot better than some of the other stuff that was played.

1489
02:01:41,440 --> 02:01:48,440
played? That being said, yes. A good solid 7. That sounds very good.

1490
02:01:48,440 --> 02:01:53,120
Uh, you know, that song was kind of odd, but it was odd in a good way. Like, it was kind

1491
02:01:53,120 --> 02:01:58,680
of one of those songs I just go, huh, that's kind of neat. Um, so, and honestly, this week

1492
02:01:58,680 --> 02:02:04,840
it better win, so I give it a 9. Girls. Like the French, I wanted the retreat from this

1493
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:15,720
song so it gets a five because it's not sorry hey Joel I like it's bouncy it's

1494
02:02:15,720 --> 02:02:22,160
happy it's any all right you've heard what we have to say now let's hear what

That's it. I know what I'm going to do.

1505
02:03:29,560 --> 02:03:31,720
Loki's shaking his finger at me. What?

1506
02:03:31,720 --> 02:03:35,000
I'm going to change my F.U. music to that.

1507
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:38,120
Loki wants to change his F.U. music to that song.

1508
02:03:38,120 --> 02:03:42,320
can't. Jackety Sax is so good though. You've been threatening to change your

1509
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:50,000
F.U. song for a while. Alright. Place your vote now guys. Hopefully somebody will

1511
02:03:56,960 --> 02:03:59,600
done so yet.

1512
02:04:02,120 --> 02:04:07,600
Alright. Moving on. I was gonna take a call on the Skype line but I'm gonna I'm

1513
02:04:07,600 --> 02:04:10,600
I'm going to hold off on that for just a minute because I just remembered something and I

1514
02:04:10,600 --> 02:04:13,040
was like, oh yeah, let's wait on it for a minute.

1515
02:04:13,040 --> 02:04:15,960
So we'll do that Skype line thing in a little bit.

1516
02:04:15,960 --> 02:04:19,360
We're going to go to a quick break, I think, and then come back.

1517
02:04:19,360 --> 02:04:24,400
Before we go to the break, though, I thought I'd scan around, see if there's any big news

1518
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:28,720
going on here we should talk about.

1519
02:04:28,720 --> 02:04:29,720
What about the...

1520
02:04:29,720 --> 02:04:30,720
Oh yeah, tell me about this.

1521
02:04:30,720 --> 02:04:33,080
This is another game I got to play for the first time this week, the guy game.

1522
02:04:33,080 --> 02:04:35,040
Tell us about what's going on there.

1523
02:04:35,040 --> 02:04:37,280
It's being recalled.

1524
02:04:37,280 --> 02:04:57,280
There is a lawsuit there against, well obviously her name is being withheld, they're just calling her Jane Doe, but she is suing both Top Heavy Studios, the producers of the game, Sony, and Microsoft for having it been released since it features her in Spring Break topless at the age of 17.

1525
02:04:57,280 --> 02:05:01,620
Lovely.

1526
02:05:01,620 --> 02:05:06,360
Yeah. Lovely, lovely, lovely. Dun, dun, dun.

1527
02:05:06,360 --> 02:05:10,600
So now the game's getting recalled. Oh yeah, so it's being yanked off store shelves with the

1528
02:05:10,600 --> 02:05:11,240
quickness.

1529
02:05:11,240 --> 02:05:15,040
I was able to snag an Xbox copy for my

1530
02:05:15,040 --> 02:05:18,560
cousin for Christmas and I told him if you ever sell this thing I will fucking kill you.

1531
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:22,280
You could ebay this probably in about a year for some big cash, who knows?

1532
02:05:22,280 --> 02:05:25,840
Seriously, it's a collector's item now. It's right up there with Custer's Revenge now at this

1533
02:05:25,840 --> 02:05:26,220
point.

1534
02:05:26,220 --> 02:05:28,780
Oh yeah, seriously. Oh yeah. Definitely.

1535
02:05:28,780 --> 02:05:35,880
Alright, we're going to go to a break now and when we come back from this break we'll

1536
02:05:35,880 --> 02:05:39,960
go to the Skype line and we'll hear who won tonight's cage match and we're going to get

1537
02:05:39,960 --> 02:05:46,200
into the FUs of the week. Busy show still ahead, so don't go anywhere. We will be back

1538
02:05:46,200 --> 02:05:48,980
after this break and I haven't even really thought about what kind of theme we should

1539
02:05:48,980 --> 02:05:57,180
to do this break. Maybe, um... No, we're not going to play Girls again. Let's play, I don't

1540
02:05:57,180 --> 02:06:01,620
know, I want to play a song we don't usually play. How about some BeatMania 5 key stuff?

1541
02:06:01,620 --> 02:06:04,980
We haven't heard some 5 key stuff in a while. Here's something from BeatMania Final. This

1542
02:06:04,980 --> 02:06:11,980
This is Fellows. We'll be back after this.

1543
02:07:34,980 --> 02:07:49,980
Yeah, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1544
02:08:04,980 --> 02:08:13,040
ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶

1545
02:08:34,980 --> 02:08:36,980
That a castle there

1546
02:09:04,980 --> 02:09:08,980
No matter what they do, they're gonna keep me gone

1547
02:09:08,980 --> 02:09:10,980
You know what they mean?

1548
02:09:10,980 --> 02:09:13,980
I'll see them again

1549
02:09:13,980 --> 02:09:18,480
Giiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

1550
02:10:43,980 --> 02:11:11,700
This is the way we dance, this is the way we rock, this is the way we vibe, as we demonstrate,

1551
02:11:11,700 --> 02:11:15,300
As we demonstrate, everybody wants a piece of the pie

1552
02:11:15,300 --> 02:11:16,900
Bolsa mila means the eye

1553
02:11:16,900 --> 02:11:18,700
Coso dos are like having the eye, know the fight

1554
02:11:18,700 --> 02:11:20,700
Cos I spy, image fly

1555

This is the way we dance, this is the way we rock

1556
02:11:23,300 --> 02:11:26,100
This is the way we ride, as we demonstrate

1557
02:11:26,100 --> 02:11:27,340
As we demonstrate

1558
02:11:44,840 --> 02:11:45,840
This is the sounds

1559
02:11:47,520 --> 02:11:48,940
This is the sounds

1560
02:11:49,320 --> 02:11:50,980
Everybody wants a piece of the pie

1561
02:11:50,980 --> 02:11:52,480
Both of me that means the eye

1562
02:11:52,480 --> 02:11:54,480
Cause I'm losing like everybody I know the vibe

1563
02:12:24,480 --> 02:12:34,480
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

1564
02:12:34,480 --> 02:12:43,480
We are back here at Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 125.

1565
02:12:43,480 --> 02:12:48,480
And let's find out who won tonight's cage match. I know you boys and girls are really excited.

1566
02:12:48,480 --> 02:12:55,280
All right, let's find out by one vote this song won

1567
02:12:58,280 --> 02:13:00,280
By one vote

02:13:02,760 --> 02:13:04,760
Don't attack see

02:13:06,840 --> 02:13:08,960
Winner of the year you do

1570
02:13:08,960 --> 02:13:17,960
I'm special. Might I add? It tastes like purple. Might I add, that was one vote over song number two.

1571
02:13:17,960 --> 02:13:29,960
You are shitting me. No. So who do we ban? I can't say, I'm sworn to secrecy. One vote over song number two.

1572
02:13:29,960 --> 02:13:41,960
Some folks trying to be funny. The chatroom is full of fuckhards. Song number one not forgotten about, not forgotten about by any means, but a little bit left in the dust there with the rest of the controversy, so sorry guys.

1573
02:13:41,960 --> 02:13:50,960
But maybe we'll do the chatroom choice again sometime at a later date. Girls. Girls.

1574
02:13:50,960 --> 02:13:58,080
Alright, I think what we're going to do is we're going to go to the Skype line in a minute

1575
02:13:58,080 --> 02:13:59,080
here.

1576
02:13:59,080 --> 02:14:04,300
We're going to do that and also we're going to be doing the FUs of the week momentarily,

1577
02:14:04,300 --> 02:14:09,900
so send those FUs over to Sky via private message and we'll take those.

1578
02:14:09,900 --> 02:14:12,600
In the meantime, let's go to the Skype line.

1579
02:14:12,600 --> 02:14:16,260
Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

1580
02:14:16,260 --> 02:14:17,260
Is this me?

1581
02:14:17,260 --> 02:14:18,260
No, this is not.

1582
02:14:18,260 --> 02:14:19,260
Hello?

1583
02:14:19,260 --> 02:14:20,260
This is me.

1584
02:14:20,260 --> 02:14:23,860
Hi. How are you? Good. Who's this? I'm on the air.

1585
02:14:23,860 --> 02:14:27,220
Hi on the air. How are you? I'm moist.

1586
02:14:27,220 --> 02:14:30,220
Aren't you always?

1587
02:14:30,220 --> 02:14:33,220
Well, when I think of you, yes.

1588
02:14:33,220 --> 02:14:37,420
And then the minute I hear Rob's voice, it shrinks up.

1589
02:14:37,420 --> 02:14:40,580
Tell him who you are, asshole.

1590
02:14:40,580 --> 02:14:46,540
I'm the asshole. Don't you want to be my friend?

1591
02:14:46,540 --> 02:14:50,140
The asshole formerly known as the Asshole of the Dance.

1592
02:14:50,140 --> 02:14:57,940
don't make me come back there the one the one and only and never replaceable

1593
02:14:57,940 --> 02:15:09,540
asshole yeah come on say all right it Travis from under sedation live.org oh

1594
02:15:09,540 --> 02:15:15,060
you like that don't you yes oh you like that bitch Duncan huh what do you want

1595
02:15:15,060 --> 02:15:19,780
Travis did you just call in to taunt us well actually I had a rant but I'm gonna

1596
02:15:19,780 --> 02:15:24,780
We'll get to that in a second. You guys were talking about, obviously you had an annoying song on earlier.

1597
02:15:24,780 --> 02:15:25,780
Yes, we did.

1598
02:15:25,780 --> 02:15:28,780
I guess it was something that was catastrophically annoying.

1599
02:15:28,780 --> 02:15:29,780
Yes, it was.

1600
02:15:29,780 --> 02:15:31,780
Well, I found something worse.

1601
02:15:31,780 --> 02:15:32,780
Okay.

1602
02:15:37,780 --> 02:15:39,780
Isn't this annoying?

1603
02:15:42,780 --> 02:15:44,780
Sounds like a game, doesn't it?

1604
02:15:44,780 --> 02:15:45,780
Yeah.

1605
02:15:45,780 --> 02:15:47,780
Can you even hear it?

1606
02:15:47,780 --> 02:15:48,780
Yes, I can. I can hear it.

1607
02:15:48,780 --> 02:15:53,780
Good!

1608
02:15:53,880 --> 02:15:54,880
That's worse...

1609
02:15:54,980 --> 02:15:56,480
What is that?

1610
02:15:56,580 --> 02:15:59,580
That's from life aquatic.

1611
02:16:00,880 --> 02:16:03,280
Oh, so that's the trailer in the movie the life aquatic?

1612
02:16:03,380 --> 02:16:04,680
Yeah, that's from the movie the life aquatic.

1613
02:16:04,780 --> 02:16:08,380
Is that supposed to be going under the sea music?

1614
02:16:08,480 --> 02:16:11,280
That is, that's going under the sea music...

1615
02:16:11,380 --> 02:16:13,480
That's the music that's playing in Bill Murray's helmet.

1616
02:16:13,580 --> 02:16:15,180
It was kind of funky.

1617
02:16:15,280 --> 02:16:17,480
That's right, that was on the trailer!

1618
02:16:17,480 --> 02:16:19,280
Yeah, and he starts doing that little butt shake.

1619
02:16:19,280 --> 02:16:21,160
I need to see that movie.

1620
02:16:21,160 --> 02:16:24,760
It was, I don't know, the girl's song, not Funky.

1621
02:16:24,760 --> 02:16:25,760
That song, Funky.

1622
02:16:25,760 --> 02:16:26,760
I don't know.

1623
02:16:26,760 --> 02:16:29,580
Dude, that one's kind of groovy, if annoying.

1624
02:16:29,580 --> 02:16:33,120
But I'm amazed Rob didn't play this when that song was on.

1625
02:16:33,120 --> 02:16:37,800
In my opinion, and I have an opinion on this show, they are losers.

1626
02:16:37,800 --> 02:16:42,160
Because Rob, your man is back in what, two weeks, three weeks?

1627
02:16:42,160 --> 02:16:45,680
Yes, Simon, my idol, yes, he's back.

1628
02:16:45,680 --> 02:16:48,080
I'm actually going to try and watch American Idol this year.

1629
02:16:48,080 --> 02:16:50,760
I didn't watch it last year.

1630
02:16:50,760 --> 02:16:54,440
But I do... I have an F.U.

1631
02:16:54,440 --> 02:16:59,800
Okay, we're going to be getting into that soon, so why not give us a preemptive F.U. here?

1632
02:16:59,800 --> 02:17:03,720
Oh, a preemptive F.U.? Whatever, a pre-school...

1633
02:17:03,720 --> 02:17:08,840
I don't know. Fine, we'll call it a four-play F.U. How's that?

1634
02:17:08,840 --> 02:17:14,320
Okay, well let me transition. Okay.

1635
02:17:14,320 --> 02:17:17,480
at a transition into FU mode

1636
02:17:17,480 --> 02:17:20,940
because you're like the only outlet i can go to when it comes to video games

1637
02:17:20,940 --> 02:17:21,820
is you guys

1638
02:17:21,820 --> 02:17:25,000
well that's what we're here for okay

1639
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:29,120
so i thought i'd get this out of my

1640
02:17:29,120 --> 02:17:30,520
out in the open now

1641
02:17:30,520 --> 02:17:31,700
i'm fucking

1642
02:17:31,700 --> 02:17:33,760
can i say that on this show?

1643
02:17:33,760 --> 02:17:35,560
uh... yes you fucking can

1644
02:17:35,560 --> 02:17:37,980
oh thank you fucking much

1645
02:17:37,980 --> 02:17:42,280
i'm sick and fucking tired of all these jack-ons on halo 2 who are fucking

1646
02:17:42,280 --> 02:17:47,080
cheating out the ass with standbys on their cable modems.

1647
02:17:47,080 --> 02:17:48,920
How do you cheat in Halo 2?

1648
02:17:48,920 --> 02:17:53,960
You put your cable modem on standby in multiplayer games like capture the flag, assault and all

1649
02:17:53,960 --> 02:17:55,860
that shit.

1650
02:17:55,860 --> 02:18:00,440
So while everyone else goes into reconnection oblivion, you're still playing your game.

1651
02:18:00,440 --> 02:18:05,160
You got the bomb, you got the flag, you go right to the gold point, set the bomb off

1652
02:18:05,160 --> 02:18:09,640
or capture the flag, take your modem out of standby and boom, you've suddenly got a point.

1653
02:18:09,640 --> 02:18:10,640
Genius.

1654
02:18:10,640 --> 02:18:16,640
Thank you for telling all our listeners how to cheat at Halo. I'm sure they're all going to go do it right now.

1655
02:18:16,640 --> 02:18:26,640
What everybody needs to do is go to bungee.net, the people behind Halo 2, get on their forum boards, report people that do this shit, and get these people banned off Xbox Live.

1656
02:18:26,640 --> 02:18:34,640
No, what's also great is those people that mod their controllers for burst firing in Halo 2. I've seen that also. That's ridiculous.

1657
02:18:34,640 --> 02:18:39,640
That's not cheating. That's just competitive play.

1658
02:18:39,640 --> 02:18:43,080
I see. Meaning that Travis doesn't. I see, okay.

1659
02:18:43,080 --> 02:18:46,240
Alright. That's called taking advantage of the scenario. Alright.

1660
02:18:46,240 --> 02:18:49,800
Okay, just like grabbing the flag through the wall. That's fun as hell.

1661
02:18:49,800 --> 02:18:54,660
Now, is it true that Bungie erased everybody's data sometime in the

1662
02:18:54,660 --> 02:18:56,820
past couple days, like all the Rumble Slayer

1663
02:18:56,820 --> 02:19:01,140
stuff went bye-bye? I heard this. If they haven't already done it, they are in the

1664
02:19:01,140 --> 02:19:04,720
process of doing this, because I've talked to a couple people in the community

1665
02:19:04,720 --> 02:19:09,100
and Bungie, they're even trying to find a way to work around

1666
02:19:09,100 --> 02:19:11,980
the the stand i don't know what to play here was one line dot that was the

1667
02:19:11,980 --> 02:19:13,780
need is thing the world was

1668
02:19:13,780 --> 02:19:16,780
wind your game goes in the lagging you disconnect

1669
02:19:16,780 --> 02:19:19,580
you don't lose the game entirely you just pick up where you left off

1670
02:19:19,580 --> 02:19:22,160
everything's fine you just keep on playing

1671
02:19:22,160 --> 02:19:24,260
well unfortunately is little you know

1672
02:19:24,260 --> 02:19:29,360
fourteen-year-old ass wipes to you know get off on gushing on pictures of lindsey

1673
02:19:29,360 --> 02:19:33,180
low hand in entertainment weekly who have no life but drinking you who

1674
02:19:33,180 --> 02:19:36,760
anything being dong's have found this little loophole through their cable

1675
02:19:36,760 --> 02:19:38,880
modems

1676
02:19:38,880 --> 02:19:45,000
So, you know, these, by the way, being the same 14 year olds that get on Xbox Live and

1677
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:49,560
while you're playing them go, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga!

1678
02:19:49,560 --> 02:19:51,680
And they're as white as you, Rob.

1679
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:54,660
Exactly, they are, whiter, in fact, if you can believe it.

1680
02:19:54,660 --> 02:19:57,960
And you can hear it in their voice, and what's funny is when I'm playing with one of my friends

1681
02:19:57,960 --> 02:20:05,240
who happens to be a man of color, listening to him crack up, listening to these guys go,

1682
02:20:05,240 --> 02:20:07,740
Oh, you nigga this, you nigga. Oh, I got you, nigga.

1683
02:20:07,740 --> 02:20:14,740
You know, and he just, he takes great pride and pleasure in coming behind them during the game and just beating them down.

1684
02:20:14,740 --> 02:20:20,740
If I could count the number of times I've heard, I'm Rick James, bitch, on Xbox Live.

1685
02:20:20,740 --> 02:20:25,740
Yeah, when will people, when will they realize Dave Chappelle is not that funny?

1686
02:20:25,740 --> 02:20:28,740
Well, I don't know. The Grand Theft Auto sketch is pretty funny. Have you seen this?

1687
02:20:28,740 --> 02:20:31,740
He's got his hits and misses, but he does have hits and misses.

1688
02:20:31,740 --> 02:20:34,240
Wayne Brady? Hilarious.

1689
02:20:34,240 --> 02:20:36,240
Yeah, okay

1690
02:20:36,280 --> 02:20:38,280
Jack Black not funny

1691
02:20:38,360 --> 02:20:43,880
You know stuff like that. I mean, I mean us white people we got Jack Black and unfortunately, you know

1692
02:20:43,880 --> 02:20:47,040
The the african-american community has Dave Chappelle. So, you know

1693
02:20:48,040 --> 02:20:50,600
Alright, but you know what? I mean, I'm serious

1694
02:20:52,640 --> 02:20:58,760
Hang on you have to go back a little bit with the Jack Black stuff and you have to go back to mr. Show

1695
02:20:58,760 --> 02:21:00,520
No.

1696
02:21:00,520 --> 02:21:02,760
He ruined every episode he was in.

1697
02:21:02,760 --> 02:21:03,760
No way.

1698
02:21:03,760 --> 02:21:04,760
No way.

1699
02:21:04,760 --> 02:21:05,760
I'm sorry.

1700
02:21:05,760 --> 02:21:06,760
Jeepers Creepers.

1701
02:21:06,760 --> 02:21:07,760
Don't put your dick in these holes.

1702
02:21:07,760 --> 02:21:08,760
That's classic.

1703
02:21:08,760 --> 02:21:09,840
Jeepers Creepers.

1704
02:21:09,840 --> 02:21:11,860
He ruined that one.

1705
02:21:11,860 --> 02:21:14,000
He ruined the farmer bit.

1706
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:15,000
No.

1707
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:16,800
He's ruined all the shit.

1708
02:21:16,800 --> 02:21:17,800
I don't like him.

1709
02:21:17,800 --> 02:21:18,800
No.

1710
02:21:18,800 --> 02:21:19,800
I hated him.

1711
02:21:19,800 --> 02:21:20,800
I can't stand Tenacious D.

1712
02:21:20,800 --> 02:21:24,440
Have you even bothered to see School of Rock?

1713
02:21:24,440 --> 02:21:25,440
Yes I have.

1714
02:21:25,440 --> 02:21:31,080
Unfortunately, my place has a habit of showing it multiple times on the electronics section,

1715
02:21:31,080 --> 02:21:35,440
so I unfortunately am cursed with seeing that movie.

1716
02:21:35,440 --> 02:21:39,680
So, how are you doing, Jess?

1717
02:21:39,680 --> 02:21:40,680
I'm in pain.

1718
02:21:40,680 --> 02:21:41,680
Why?

1719
02:21:41,680 --> 02:21:42,680
What's wrong, hon?

1720
02:21:42,680 --> 02:21:48,760
My left side hurts for no apparent reason, and it has been since, like, Friday, so I'm

1721
02:21:48,760 --> 02:21:52,560
trying to determine if it's because of working out too much or not.

1722
02:21:52,560 --> 02:21:56,560
Well, you know what it could be, now that I think about it, you know?

1723
02:21:56,560 --> 02:21:57,560
I'm not pregnant!

1724
02:21:57,560 --> 02:21:58,560
No, no, no!

1725
02:21:58,560 --> 02:22:00,560
I don't have AIDS!

1726
02:22:00,560 --> 02:22:02,560
It could be a tumor!

1727
02:22:02,560 --> 02:22:03,560
It's not a tumor!

1728
02:22:03,560 --> 02:22:04,560
It's not a tumor!

1729
02:22:04,560 --> 02:22:05,560
Okay.

1730
02:22:05,560 --> 02:22:10,560
See, I could play, you know?

1731
02:22:10,560 --> 02:22:12,560
I envy your soundboard, what can I say?

1732
02:22:12,560 --> 02:22:14,560
We don't have anything that fancy.

1733
02:22:14,560 --> 02:22:19,560
This is why I came up with the other idea, which, you know, I'm emailing you all, I've

1734
02:22:19,560 --> 02:22:24,560
I've set a date tentatively, and then I hope you all are capable of participating.

1735
02:22:24,560 --> 02:22:25,560
I'll have to pencil it in.

1736
02:22:25,560 --> 02:22:26,560
Yes.

1737
02:22:26,560 --> 02:22:29,560
Just pencil in the 29th of January.

1738
02:22:29,560 --> 02:22:32,560
Wow, that happens to be my birthday weekend.

1739
02:22:32,560 --> 02:22:33,560
Hi!

1740
02:22:33,560 --> 02:22:36,560
Good planning on my part, huh?

1741
02:22:36,560 --> 02:22:39,560
Potentially bad, but we'll see.

1742
02:22:39,560 --> 02:22:40,560
Oh, I see.

1743
02:22:40,560 --> 02:22:41,560
Your birthday's more important.

1744
02:22:41,560 --> 02:22:44,560
Okay.

1745
02:22:44,560 --> 02:22:45,560
Well, I'll remember that.

1746
02:22:45,560 --> 02:22:50,560
I'm only turning 28, you old fart, but it's still important.

1747
02:22:55,560 --> 02:22:59,560
I think Travis just shot himself, ladies and gentlemen, live on air.

1748
02:22:59,560 --> 02:23:00,560
No, um...

1749
02:23:00,560 --> 02:23:01,560
Oh, darn.

1750
02:23:01,560 --> 02:23:03,560
Have you even told...

1751
02:23:03,560 --> 02:23:06,560
No, it's just Texas. You get all sorts of gun noises out there.

1752
02:23:06,560 --> 02:23:07,560
Oh, yeah.

1753
02:23:07,560 --> 02:23:10,560
You forget we live in shit-kicking Texas.

1754
02:23:11,560 --> 02:23:13,560
Have we even told them what?

1755
02:23:13,560 --> 02:23:17,560
Well, I mean, I know Jess knows. I know you know. I know Jamie knows.

1756
02:23:17,560 --> 02:23:21,560
Anybody else around knows about the little thing?

1757
02:23:21,560 --> 02:23:23,560
Yeah, I do.

1758
02:23:23,560 --> 02:23:25,560
Angel says yes, she does.

1759
02:23:25,560 --> 02:23:26,560
Okay. Alright.

1760
02:23:26,560 --> 02:23:29,560
And Ross knows, but he doesn't realize he knows.

1761
02:23:29,560 --> 02:23:36,560
People know. They know. Anyway, I don't want to steer too off track here, but I do want to say, some folks in the chat room think you're pretty funny, Travis.

1762
02:23:36,560 --> 02:23:39,560
You have some fans in the chat room already.

1763
02:23:39,560 --> 02:23:46,440
yeah exactly that's what I said when I read it um if you guys think Travis is

1764
02:23:46,440 --> 02:23:55,720
funny then you know what um you can listen to Travis's show it's under

1765
02:23:55,720 --> 02:24:02,360
sedation live www.under station live.org it's where iguana girl and I got our

1766
02:24:02,360 --> 02:24:06,600
start on internet radio and dark sacra to some extent as well I was number one

1767
02:24:06,600 --> 02:24:12,600
most often guess. I know you weren't. Yes. Hey Rob? Yes. Hey, I just got one thing to

1768
02:24:12,600 --> 02:24:19,160
say. Do you really think you can do all that bullshit you just said? I'm just trying to

1769
02:24:19,160 --> 02:24:29,040
help you out buddy. What the hell are you doing? It was a weird echo. Go. Go. Stop that.

1770
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:31,040
I'm hanging up on you. No you're not!

1771
02:24:31,040 --> 02:24:33,040
Use the force!

1772
02:24:36,040 --> 02:24:38,040
Do you honestly want to get into that type of war with me?

1773
02:24:39,040 --> 02:24:41,040
You know you'll lose.

1774
02:24:44,040 --> 02:24:46,040
You're gonna be in the process too.

1775
02:24:46,040 --> 02:24:48,040
What?

1776
02:24:48,040 --> 02:24:50,040
You're being mean to me in the process too.

1777
02:24:50,040 --> 02:24:52,040
Turn your goddamn echo thing off!

1778
02:24:52,040 --> 02:24:54,040
Hey, Rob.

1779
02:24:54,040 --> 02:24:56,040
What?

1780
02:24:59,040 --> 02:25:01,040
I can make everybody sound like chipmunks.

1781
02:25:02,040 --> 02:25:03,040
I hate you.

1782
02:25:07,040 --> 02:25:09,040
And then I can do 3D effects.

1783
02:25:11,040 --> 02:25:17,040
See, this is what happens when I waste my money on toys that I don't need instead of, you know, getting stuff that my daughter really needs, like diapers.

1784
02:25:17,040 --> 02:25:21,040
You know, it's kind of hard wrapping her up in brown paper bags.

1785
02:25:21,040 --> 02:25:25,040
Let's say Walmart on the side.

1786
02:25:25,040 --> 02:25:29,040
Actually, never mind, it won't go there.

1787
02:25:29,040 --> 02:25:33,040
Anywho, don't forget, the 29th, if that's a conflict,

1788
02:25:33,040 --> 02:25:37,040
let me know ahead of time, I will attempt to reschedule.

1789
02:25:37,040 --> 02:25:41,040
But we need to test out how it's going to work in sound.

1790
02:25:41,040 --> 02:25:45,040
Our people will be in touch with your people.

1791
02:25:45,040 --> 02:25:47,040
Oh, get your people with my people?

1792
02:25:47,040 --> 02:25:47,540
Yes.

1793
02:25:47,540 --> 02:25:49,040
I have no people.

1794
02:25:50,540 --> 02:25:52,040
You have little people?

1795
02:25:55,040 --> 02:25:57,040
And Rob just has people that come around him going,

1796
02:25:57,040 --> 02:25:58,540
Ooh, Rob's cool.

1797
02:25:58,540 --> 02:26:01,540
Wanna touch him? I touched him. Wanna touch him? Ooh, I touched him.

1798
02:26:03,040 --> 02:26:05,040
Who has a trash?

1799
02:26:06,040 --> 02:26:08,040
What the hell is going on on your end?

1800
02:26:08,040 --> 02:26:10,040
It sounds like you guys are like pushing some weird button.

1801
02:26:10,040 --> 02:26:12,040
No, you've got the echo thing on.

1802
02:26:12,040 --> 02:26:17,040
No, I don't. I turned off all my echo shit.

1803
02:26:17,040 --> 02:26:20,040
I don't know what's going on.

1804
02:26:20,040 --> 02:26:22,040
Oh, you scare me, man.

1805
02:26:22,040 --> 02:26:24,040
Alright, thanks for calling in, Travis.

1806
02:26:24,040 --> 02:26:25,040
I gotta go.

1807
02:26:25,040 --> 02:26:26,040
Later.

1808
02:26:26,040 --> 02:26:28,040
Bye, bye, bye.

1809
02:26:28,040 --> 02:26:31,040
That was not on my end.

1810
02:26:31,040 --> 02:26:34,040
Oh look, it's gone! Magically!

1811
02:26:34,040 --> 02:26:37,040
I wonder how that happened.

1812
02:26:37,040 --> 02:26:38,040
Oh no.

1813
02:26:38,040 --> 02:26:40,040
I swear he does that just to piss us off.

1814
02:26:40,040 --> 02:26:41,040
Yeah, I know.

1815
02:26:41,040 --> 02:26:46,400
Alright, again, if you thought that was funny, I don't know why, but no, I'm kidding.

1816
02:26:46,400 --> 02:26:50,560
Uh, understationlive.org, we do love Travis, and of course Jenna, we love Jenna even more.

1817
02:26:50,560 --> 02:26:51,560
I mean, honestly.

1818
02:26:51,560 --> 02:26:52,560
Because Jenna is hot.

1819
02:26:52,560 --> 02:26:53,960
It's all about Jenna, really.

1820
02:26:53,960 --> 02:26:54,960
Jenna is hot.

1821
02:26:54,960 --> 02:26:55,960
Jenna is a hottie.

1822
02:26:55,960 --> 02:26:56,960
Totally.

1823
02:26:56,960 --> 02:26:57,960
It's all about Kira.

1824
02:26:57,960 --> 02:26:58,960
Alright.

1825
02:26:58,960 --> 02:27:00,960
And Kira's a cutie.

1826
02:27:00,960 --> 02:27:01,960
Alright.

1827
02:27:01,960 --> 02:27:05,840
If you want to find out what we were talking about there with the 29th, just head on over

1828
02:27:05,840 --> 02:27:09,240
understationlive.org and there'll be more information soon.

1829
02:27:09,240 --> 02:27:13,240
And then it involves us. So, you'll see.

1830
02:27:13,240 --> 02:27:19,240
Exactly. Alright. Oh, I'm so glad that we get to go from that phone call into this next segment,

1831
02:27:19,240 --> 02:27:24,240
because this next segment is a good one to follow that up with, and it's the FUs of the Week.

1832
02:27:24,240 --> 02:27:29,240
It's our chance to rant a little bit about the things that have been pissing us off today, or all week long.

1833
02:27:29,240 --> 02:27:34,240
And, Jamie, why is it that we have to do these FUs of the Week every single week?

1834
02:27:34,240 --> 02:27:36,240
Because of girls.

1835
02:27:52,240 --> 02:27:54,240
My first F.U. of the week goes to your dryer.

1836
02:27:55,240 --> 02:27:57,240
My second F.U. of the week goes towards the fatigue flu.

1837
02:27:57,240 --> 02:28:06,440
flu for making me feel like crap another one goes to stress as you goes to

1838
02:28:06,440 --> 02:28:12,920
distance money but I am very glad though that I am getting a raise with my new

1839
02:28:12,920 --> 02:28:17,840
job which is probably gonna go to pay for bills humongous as you goes to

1840
02:28:17,840 --> 02:28:25,360
GameStop incorporated if you goes toward the holidays in general for screwing

1841
02:28:25,360 --> 02:28:34,640
with my head. Um, an F.U. goes toward stupid fuckers who drive really stupidly in the rain.

1842
02:28:34,640 --> 02:28:39,680
Like, let's go, you know, there's one thing to drive five miles under the speed limit

1843
02:28:39,680 --> 02:28:47,160
when you're, you know, in the rain. Five to ten miles, depending on the conditions, is

1844
02:28:47,160 --> 02:28:53,200
smart. Thirty miles under the goddamn speed limit. Someone's going twenty. And, like,

1845
02:28:53,200 --> 02:28:58,840
Unless you, you know, if your car is so bad to the point where you cannot drive in the

1846
02:28:58,840 --> 02:29:03,520
rain, you need to either get a new car or take the damn bus, okay?

1847
02:29:03,520 --> 02:29:10,480
Um, it's, it was just one thing after, I'm a very easily frustrated driver though, so

1848
02:29:10,480 --> 02:29:12,400
that could just be it, but.

1849
02:29:12,400 --> 02:29:18,080
And another one goes toward people who have 20 items when it says 15 items or less in

1850
02:29:18,080 --> 02:29:19,480
the damn express line.

1851
02:29:19,480 --> 02:29:21,480
Okay, I'm done.

1852
02:29:21,480 --> 02:29:27,160
Sorry about that, I got a little bit of Loki's music in there because I ran into the other

1853
02:29:27,160 --> 02:29:28,160
room for a second there.

1854
02:29:28,160 --> 02:29:30,080
I'll try and fix that in this situation.

1855
02:29:30,080 --> 02:29:31,960
Now we will get to Loki's FUs of the Week.

1856
02:29:31,960 --> 02:29:32,960
Here we go.

1857
02:29:32,960 --> 02:29:33,960
Yeah.

1858
02:29:33,960 --> 02:29:34,960
I'm...

1859
02:29:34,960 --> 02:29:37,960
God damn it, I don't have enough cord.

1860
02:29:37,960 --> 02:29:41,840
Okay, I'll make this really quick because I'm cooking stuff.

1861
02:29:41,840 --> 02:29:42,840
Let's see here.

1862
02:29:42,840 --> 02:29:43,840
Fuck you, stupid drivers.

1863
02:29:43,840 --> 02:29:47,000
Fuck you to the fact that I don't feel good right now.

1864
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,280
I think I caught someone's cold.

1865
02:29:49,280 --> 02:29:53,200
And um, uh, let's see, fuck you to work because they're not paying me enough so I have to

1866
02:29:53,200 --> 02:29:58,560
get a new job, and I'm sure there's some other stuff I can't remember right now, I have a

1867
02:29:58,560 --> 02:30:03,280
lot of stuff earlier, but hey, we're gonna keep it short, that's my gift to you.

1868
02:30:03,280 --> 02:30:10,560
Alright!

1869
02:30:10,560 --> 02:30:13,640
I like to give an F.U. to people that try to drive in the rain because it's obvious

1870
02:30:13,640 --> 02:30:18,200
that nobody knows how to do it, because whenever I get out there and I try to drive and it's

1871
02:30:18,200 --> 02:30:22,520
been raining just nobody knows that they're doing so I just what's wrong

1872
02:30:22,520 --> 02:30:27,480
with people what is it about rain oh my god water falling from the sky I need to

1873
02:30:27,480 --> 02:30:31,340
start cutting more people off and driving 25 under the speed limit or 25

1874
02:30:31,340 --> 02:30:35,200
over the speed limit and coming up on your ass and you know refusing to pass

1875
02:30:35,200 --> 02:30:41,340
you I hate people but I hate parking lots a big f you to Roseville and this

1876
02:30:41,340 --> 02:30:47,960
place that I call Whitey Plaza because damn what a bunch of yuppies I just oh I

1877
02:30:47,960 --> 02:30:54,360
I hate that place. Anyway, that's pretty much it. Otherwise, everything's pretty good, and I can't really complain a whole lot

1878
02:30:54,360 --> 02:30:59,480
So we're gonna move on and going around. Let's start it off with who's got a mic over there jazz

1879
02:31:01,600 --> 02:31:05,120
If you two people who do not signal when they merge

1880
02:31:05,840 --> 02:31:13,400
And holy crap, I have never seen so many people do that here and try to cut you off. It is ridiculous. Damn

1881
02:31:13,400 --> 02:31:20,400
Also, I view it as people who don't signal when they're making a left turn that isn't protected.

1882
02:31:20,400 --> 02:31:28,400
Oh my god. People in Milpitas do this all the time. I'm trying to get out of a shopping center and it's raining, so it's hard enough to see what's going on.

1883
02:31:28,400 --> 02:31:34,400
And people keep turning and turning and I can either go straight or left and I'm assuming they can too.

1884
02:31:34,400 --> 02:31:38,400
I'm like, oh my god, what are they going to do? No one's signaling but oh my god, they're all turning.

1885
02:31:38,400 --> 02:31:45,400
They're all turning, so I'm like, oh no, oh no, and finally they all go through and they all turn, and I'm like, fuck you all, and they just go in my merry way.

1886
02:31:45,400 --> 02:31:54,400
Uh, I'll do FU to Taiken 5, because let's suck at it. Uh, yeah, that's about it.

1887
02:31:54,400 --> 02:31:57,400
Alright, Islander!

1888
02:31:57,400 --> 02:32:03,400
The only FU I can think of, really, is FU to my car doors for, like, not closing all the way and letting rainwater in.

1889
02:32:03,400 --> 02:32:08,040
in I have to like keep a stack of newspapers on both feet to keep it dry

1890
02:32:08,040 --> 02:32:14,960

02:33:11,580 --> 02:33:15,580

02:33:27,580 --> 02:33:55,580

02:34:04,580 --> 02:34:10,580
I don't want to learn to drive from you. Your skills may be leaped in your opinion, but your temper sucks too much for me to put up with you at times already.

1905
02:34:10,580 --> 02:34:14,580
I don't want to put up with your shit when I have to put up with the other retards on the road.

1906
02:34:14,580 --> 02:34:19,580
F you to StepMania. Alpha24 was the most recent one that actually worked for me.

1907

Misty says oh yeah F you to school starting January 10th

1921
02:35:40,380 --> 02:35:41,860
I'm going to refrain from comment

1922
02:35:41,860 --> 02:35:49,740
Ram says F U M S depression and A D D. K Dash says F U to New Year's because I was

1923
02:35:49,740 --> 02:35:56,480
all alone. Oh I'm sorry. Next time tune in to see what's going on with the internet radio

1924
02:35:56,480 --> 02:36:04,060
because we're around sometimes on New Year's so I know what little concession. Jaded 2005

1925
02:36:04,060 --> 02:36:09,540
says F U to people who think I know everything about computers when they can't work them.

1926
02:36:09,540 --> 02:36:16,700

Alright.

1929
02:36:23,560 --> 02:36:25,940
Very ranty chat room there.

1930
02:36:25,940 --> 02:36:26,940
What can I say?

1931
02:36:26,940 --> 02:36:30,660
Alright, but they typically are.

1932
02:36:30,660 --> 02:36:31,660
They're moody usually.

1933
02:36:31,660 --> 02:36:35,820
Alright, we're going to go to a break and when we come back from this break, we are

1934
02:36:35,820 --> 02:36:39,260
going to do some Ask Orange Lounge.

1935
02:36:39,260 --> 02:36:43,420
So you will have a chance to ask us just about anything you want. Send your questions in

1936
02:36:43,420 --> 02:36:49,100
right now over private message to Sky and we'll take care of those. In the meantime,

1937
02:36:49,100 --> 02:36:53,300
we were talking about home versions a little earlier so I thought maybe we could play some

1938
02:36:53,300 --> 02:37:04,300
good songs that were on home version stuff. And I'll see if I can find it. All right.

1939
02:37:04,300 --> 02:37:08,020
Loki says I have to play a certain song from 2DX so maybe we'll squeeze that in somewhere

1940
02:37:08,020 --> 02:37:15,020
We will be back after this. We're going to start it off with a very popular track from DDR Extreme USA. We'll be back.

1941
02:37:38,020 --> 02:37:40,020
So little hope, so little hope

1942
02:37:40,020 --> 02:37:42,020
And I'm paying it out for love

1943
02:37:42,020 --> 02:37:44,020
Yeah

1944
02:37:44,020 --> 02:37:47,020
So little fear that makes me change

1945
02:37:47,020 --> 02:37:49,020
But not so late

1946
02:37:49,020 --> 02:37:51,020
A thousand years of Dallas Bay

1947
02:37:51,020 --> 02:37:53,020
So emulate

1948
02:37:53,020 --> 02:37:55,020
So emulate in the dark

1949
02:37:55,020 --> 02:37:57,020
But I'm raised up for love, love

1950
02:37:57,020 --> 02:37:59,020
Love

1951
02:37:59,020 --> 02:38:02,020
Love, love, love

1952
02:38:02,020 --> 02:38:04,020
So maybe love

1953
02:38:04,020 --> 02:38:06,020
Love, love

1954
02:38:06,020 --> 02:38:16,820
Similar love, similar love, similar love

1955
02:38:16,820 --> 02:38:19,960
More than love, yeah, yeah

1956
02:38:19,960 --> 02:38:23,340
Similar love, yeah, yeah

1957
02:38:23,340 --> 02:38:30,720
Similar love, yeah, yeah

1958
02:38:30,720 --> 02:38:35,800
Similar love, yeah

1959
02:38:35,800 --> 02:38:56,800
Simply be love, is more than enough

1960
02:39:05,800 --> 02:39:32,800
Holding on to all my fading memories

1961
02:39:32,800 --> 02:39:36,300
Back to where it all began

1962
02:39:36,300 --> 02:39:39,300
So much there I understand

1963
02:39:39,300 --> 02:39:42,800
As I look now

1964
02:39:42,800 --> 02:39:46,800
To a distance far away

1965
02:39:46,800 --> 02:39:49,800
I will cross familiar lines

1966
02:39:49,800 --> 02:39:52,800
Now I'm standing still in time

1967
02:39:52,800 --> 02:39:56,300
Still in time

1968
02:39:56,300 --> 02:39:59,800
Still in time

1969
02:39:59,800 --> 02:40:06,800
Still in time, still in time

1970
02:40:29,800 --> 02:40:53,800
I thought that I was gonna lose you, yeah Just have a one-on-one game, yeah

1971
02:40:53,800 --> 02:40:56,800
I was born to be dead

1972
02:40:56,800 --> 02:41:00,800
Just after one of these days, yeah

1973
02:41:00,800 --> 02:41:03,800
Didn't know what to do

1974
02:41:03,800 --> 02:41:06,800
Then there was you, yeah

1975
02:41:06,800 --> 02:41:10,800
And baby, feeling right so wrong tonight

1976
02:41:10,800 --> 02:41:14,800
And the stars came up in the sky

1977
02:41:14,800 --> 02:41:18,800
The music you were playing really blew my mind

1978
02:41:18,800 --> 02:41:22,300
Love is perfect

1979
02:41:22,300 --> 02:41:26,800
Cause baby, when I heard you say

1980
02:41:26,800 --> 02:41:30,300
Love was not an idea

1981
02:41:30,300 --> 02:41:33,800
We were meant to be

1982
02:41:33,800 --> 02:41:37,800
Love was not an idea

1983
02:41:37,800 --> 02:41:41,800
Cause baby, when I heard you say

1984
02:41:41,800 --> 02:41:45,800
Love was not an idea

1985
02:41:45,800 --> 02:41:54,800
We were meant to be one

1986
02:42:15,800 --> 02:42:22,800
It's a place you can hide, no care or frustration, leave the world behind

1987
02:42:22,800 --> 02:42:30,800
Time to look to the light, do we find the right direction, you know we all can find

1988
02:42:30,800 --> 02:42:34,800
Gonna take you through the light, turn your darkness into light

1989
02:42:34,800 --> 02:42:38,800
Gonna find a better day, go and don't give up this way

1990
02:42:38,800 --> 02:42:41,800
Gonna take you through the light, turn your darkness into light

1991
02:43:11,800 --> 02:43:15,800
To the morning light, take it, na na na, take it

1992
02:43:15,800 --> 02:43:20,800
To the morning light, to the break I say

1993
02:43:22,800 --> 02:43:27,800
To the morning light, to the break I say

1994
02:43:33,800 --> 02:43:38,800
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting

1995
02:43:38,800 --> 02:43:40,800
Do you want to be interviewed by Hollywood?

1996
02:43:40,800 --> 02:43:42,800
No!

1997
02:43:42,800 --> 02:43:44,800
Do we care what people think of us?

1998
02:43:44,800 --> 02:43:46,800
No!

1999
02:43:46,800 --> 02:43:48,800
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

2000
02:43:48,800 --> 02:43:50,800
Yeah!

2001
02:43:52,800 --> 02:43:58,800
Extreme Bamani Radio. That's us. Orange Lounge Radio.

2002
02:44:00,800 --> 02:44:02,800
Alright, we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2003
02:44:02,800 --> 02:44:04,800
We're kind of getting into the home stretch.

2004
02:44:04,800 --> 02:44:07,800
But you know, some folks in the chat room were kind of asking tonight

2005
02:44:07,800 --> 02:44:11,200
if we were going to do an Ask Orange Lounge segment, and I said, you know what, sure.

2006
02:44:11,200 --> 02:44:14,640
It's been a few weeks since we've done Ask Orange Lounge, we did List List a couple weeks

2007
02:44:14,640 --> 02:44:18,000
ago, we did Match Game and stuff, so we haven't done Ask Orange Lounge in a little while,

2008
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:21,440
and this is a segment where you can just basically ask us whatever you want.

2009
02:44:21,440 --> 02:44:26,840
This is a great way to get us to actually talk about DDR if you want, or you could go

2010
02:44:26,840 --> 02:44:30,980
out of left field, maybe you have a relationship problem you want to ask us about, and Jamie

2011
02:44:30,980 --> 02:44:36,400
will give you straight up advice, really, and you may not want to hear it, but she'll

2012
02:44:36,400 --> 02:44:40,360
give the honest answer but remember we love you that's why we're honest

2013
02:44:40,360 --> 02:44:44,080
beginner alright so that being said

2014
02:44:44,080 --> 02:44:48,080
let's get into it and we kick it off with me making an ass out of myself with

2015
02:44:48,080 --> 02:44:55,080
a little opening theme song

2016
02:44:55,920 --> 02:44:59,040
let's ask orange lounge some stupid question

2017
02:44:59,040 --> 02:45:02,760
what will we find out this week on orange lounge radio

2018
02:45:02,760 --> 02:45:06,440
Is someone bound to ask a stupid dating question?

2019
02:45:06,440 --> 02:45:10,120
I really hope not, because Dark Sakura will tear up a new butthole.

2020
02:45:10,120 --> 02:45:17,120
Girls.

2021
02:45:18,600 --> 02:45:21,880
What are you cooking over there, Loki? I have to ask. Loki's garlicky.

2022
02:45:21,880 --> 02:45:25,280
Loki's cooking and it smells like garlic, and now all of a sudden I'm like, garlic.

2023
02:45:25,280 --> 02:45:29,320
Oh, you doing the fried rice thing?

2024
02:45:29,320 --> 02:45:33,520
oh his fried rice beautiful

2025
02:45:33,520 --> 02:45:40,520
he learned from the Benihana chefs alright

2026
02:45:40,520 --> 02:45:43,480
let's move on to question number one

2027
02:45:43,480 --> 02:45:47,840
illusion this is a question from illusion brace yourself you knew this

2028
02:45:47,840 --> 02:45:48,840
would be random

2029
02:45:48,840 --> 02:45:53,440
if you throw a blender off of the Leaning Tower of Pisa

2030
02:45:53,440 --> 02:45:57,800
and it lands in the Gulf of Mexico who did the wrapping in that one paranoia

2031
02:45:57,800 --> 02:46:02,140
remixed Loki did. I think it was Paranoia Revolution or something. He said it would

2032
02:46:02,140 --> 02:46:08,880
be the last one, if that helps any. So, Loki did this remix of Paranoia Revolution, and

2033
02:46:08,880 --> 02:46:14,000
I guess it has... I remember this remix that Loki did a while back. It was... What the

2034
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,700
hell was the name of this, Loki? Can we tear you away from the kitchen for just a minute

2035
02:46:16,700 --> 02:46:21,880
to ask you about this? The rapping? Yeah, what was the rapping in it from? That was

2036
02:46:21,880 --> 02:46:27,540
from the song, actually, called The Revolution. It's by BT. I forget who he has that does

2037
02:46:27,540 --> 02:46:32,020
rapping but he's like on a bunch of different albums and I think it said who

2038
02:46:32,020 --> 02:46:37,740
his name was and I don't remember um Scotty D it's not Scotty D that's

2039
02:46:37,740 --> 02:46:50,200
retarded I can't remember why you look for that let me play a clip from

2040
02:46:50,200 --> 02:46:54,060
paranoia revolution and I but the rapping was towards the end right okay

2041
02:46:54,060 --> 02:46:56,460
here here's a little clip of paranoia revolution so you know what the hell

2042
02:46:56,460 --> 02:47:00,100
we're talking about. This is a Loki remix that you can find on his website, which is

2043
02:47:00,100 --> 02:47:07,100
lowkeyfusion.tk still? Alright, here it is.

2044
02:47:30,100 --> 02:47:46,500
Ooh, very sexy clip there from Paranoia Revolution, if you want to download the whole thing, it's

2045
02:47:46,500 --> 02:47:51,380
loki-fusion.tk, and I've heard that clip, the revolution will be televised, I think

2046
02:47:51,380 --> 02:47:56,380
I saw that on a bumper sticker once, that's what the guy said in one part there, alright,

2047
02:47:56,380 --> 02:48:00,860
Alright, alright. While Loki does some more research on that, I'm going to go ahead and

2048
02:48:00,860 --> 02:48:05,940
move on and you can come back to this question a little later, but it's from BT, basically,

2049
02:48:05,940 --> 02:48:11,500
the short answer to your question. And Delusion would also like to add on a note, and I'm

2050
02:48:11,500 --> 02:48:17,700
going to play some apologetic music to match his mood here on this note here, so I'll play

2051
02:48:17,700 --> 02:48:26,020
some very solemn apologetic music here. Oh, no, Loki found it. God damn it, who the fuck

2052
02:48:26,020 --> 02:48:35,020
What is this? It was in the song Mad Skills. Mike Cheka is the name of the song that was on his album Movement and Still Life.

2053
02:48:35,020 --> 02:48:42,020
And they actually, I think, in the song he says who it is. Because, you know, they do that stupid, you know, shout out crap in it.

2054
02:48:42,020 --> 02:48:49,020
So, I don't remember who he's partnered with, but it's the same guy that's on like all these albums.

2055
02:48:49,020 --> 02:48:53,020
And Movement and Still Life would be a good one to find out who's in that.

2056
02:48:53,020 --> 02:49:00,020
He doesn't give any credits anywhere else looking on Amazon, but no, nothing. So, um, oh well.

2057
02:49:01,020 --> 02:49:09,020
Alright, let me get to another note from Illusion here. He would like to offer a formal apology.

2058
02:49:10,020 --> 02:49:16,020
He says, I'm sorry, and I'm adding the crying noises because I know he's making them up.

2059
02:49:16,020 --> 02:49:26,340
I'm sorry to everyone that I pissed off. I, too, will be going to community college, though

2060
02:49:26,340 --> 02:49:31,960
I'm not too excited about it, nor would I be excited about any college. So, there you

2061
02:49:31,960 --> 02:49:39,220
have it. A formal apology courtesy of Illusion. And there will be a replay of that apology

2062
02:49:39,220 --> 02:49:44,940
next week on DDO Free Radio. In case you missed it or you want to tell your friends.

2063
02:49:44,940 --> 02:49:51,940
Alright. K-Dash. Okay. K-Dash has a question about Beatmania 2DX.

2064
02:49:51,940 --> 02:49:57,940
I'm planning on buying 2DX and I would like to know if anyone has any tips for me concerning whether I should get a flip-top

2065
02:49:57,940 --> 02:50:02,940
or just a Japanese PlayStation 2. And the best place that I could purchase them from.

2066
02:50:02,940 --> 02:50:05,940
Thank you. Japanese PS2 and CSX.

2067
02:50:05,940 --> 02:50:10,940
I would also go with the Japanese PlayStation 2. The flip-tops are becoming a little more...

2068
02:50:10,940 --> 02:50:14,740
Like, you know, like, if you'd asked us this two years ago, we would have said, straight

2069
02:50:14,740 --> 02:50:18,660
up, do not trust the mods, go for a Japanese Playstation 2.

2070
02:50:18,660 --> 02:50:22,420
They're a little better now, and I think there's more out there that you can kind of trust,

2071
02:50:22,420 --> 02:50:26,300
but if you want the real thing, you want a collector's item, I would say just spend the

2072
02:50:26,300 --> 02:50:28,840
extra money, get a PS2, because you're going to have to pay someone to install it, unless

2073
02:50:28,840 --> 02:50:29,840
you do it, I mean, I don't know, maybe do it yourself.

2074
02:50:29,840 --> 02:50:31,300
I'm talking about they're less expensive now.

2075
02:50:31,300 --> 02:50:35,800
I mean, if you want one of the nude, skinny, tiny, and they have all the pretty colors,

2076
02:50:35,800 --> 02:50:38,900
they have the Sakura colors, and the, Those are only those for the old model.

2077
02:50:38,900 --> 02:50:39,900
Oh, okay.

2078
02:50:39,900 --> 02:50:43,900
going to get a very brand new one, they're all going to be the slim style.

2079
02:50:43,900 --> 02:50:44,900
Alright.

2080
02:50:44,900 --> 02:50:45,900
Islander.

2081
02:50:45,900 --> 02:50:46,900
Yeah, no.

2082
02:50:46,900 --> 02:50:51,020
I second the whole, you know, getting the Japanese PS2, you know, wholeheartedly.

2083
02:50:51,020 --> 02:50:54,740
I don't trust the flip top still, I don't know why.

2084
02:50:54,740 --> 02:51:02,700
And make sure when you buy it, you buy a Japanese PS2, not an Asian PS2.

2085
02:51:02,700 --> 02:51:06,300
There is a difference, thank you.

2086
02:51:06,300 --> 02:51:10,580
Even though it is cheaper and, you know, it looks like it's going to be a good deal for

2087
02:51:10,580 --> 02:51:15,660
you, you have to, you actually have to use a converter because it is different power

2088
02:51:15,660 --> 02:51:20,380
than the Japanese PS2, American PS2 voltage.

2089
02:51:20,380 --> 02:51:25,980
So you end up putting that amount of money back into a good converter that you don't

2090
02:51:25,980 --> 02:51:28,520
fry your PS2 with.

2091
02:51:28,520 --> 02:51:29,520
Very good tip.

2092
02:51:29,520 --> 02:51:31,620
A lot of something people don't think about sometimes.

2093
02:51:31,620 --> 02:51:32,780
All right.

2094
02:51:32,780 --> 02:51:36,660
So as far as that goes, it sounds like we kind of give the consensus, you know what,

2095
02:51:36,660 --> 02:51:41,580
just go and get the Japanese Playstation 2, it's cheap and you won't regret it later.

2096
02:51:41,580 --> 02:51:46,540
And was she asking what style to or did she just ask other tips or he, I'm sorry, I don't

2097
02:51:46,540 --> 02:51:49,460
know if it's he or she, sorry.

2098
02:51:49,460 --> 02:51:52,260
I'm not sure, so we'll just move on.

2099
02:51:52,260 --> 02:51:54,780
I would say as far as styles are concerned, because usually that's another question that

2100
02:51:54,780 --> 02:51:56,900
goes along with it, is what style should I get.

2101
02:51:56,900 --> 02:51:59,920
You really just have to evaluate the song list and look at the one that has the songs

2102
02:51:59,920 --> 02:52:00,920
you want.

2103
02:52:00,920 --> 02:52:04,240
beginners go though I wouldn't go with third or fourth if you're a beginner

2104
02:52:04,240 --> 02:52:09,200
just because fifth and later had more beginner friendly modes in it overall I

2105
02:52:09,200 --> 02:52:15,000
would say as far as song selection actually 8th style doesn't really have

2106
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:23,120
too many beginner friendly songs even in light 7 I would actually point people to

2107
02:52:23,120 --> 02:52:26,320
fifth style let's say if you're gonna start anywhere start with this style has

2108
02:52:26,320 --> 02:52:30,140
a lot more beginner friendly songs except the sixth style does have the

2109
02:52:30,140 --> 02:52:36,340
beginner mode in it so it really depends I mean as far as song selection eight

2110
02:52:36,340 --> 02:52:41,700
styles got a bajillion you know seven style has a whole bunch but I think

2111
02:52:41,700 --> 02:52:46,460
overall you're best starting with fifth or sixth all right let's move on we got

2112
02:52:46,460 --> 02:52:49,580
more questions here we want to get through before the show is over on dark

2113
02:52:49,580 --> 02:52:52,180
night asked me this question earlier in the show and I wanted to get it out

2114
02:52:52,180 --> 02:52:56,380
there we talked last week we talked a little bit about resolutions you don't

2115
02:52:56,380 --> 02:53:00,060
plan on keeping this is kind of in those same veins so if you think about it

2116
02:53:00,060 --> 02:53:04,500
a little bit of a different question, and, you know, just share if you want, you guys,

2117
02:53:04,500 --> 02:53:12,300
but your goals for 2005, a goal for 2005, do you have any goals that you'd like to share?

2118
02:53:12,300 --> 02:53:17,860
I'll start it off. I really want to get to Maniac mode this year, that's it. I gotta

2119
02:53:17,860 --> 02:53:23,460
do it. And probably get better at 2DX as well, although I don't really know where I'm going

2120
02:53:23,460 --> 02:53:29,820
with that, but let's just stick to DDR first. My goals for this year are very simple, and

2121
02:53:29,820 --> 02:53:33,500
And actually, I met one before the year began, because my goal was to be in a new job.

2122
02:53:33,500 --> 02:53:37,180
One of my resolutions I put in my life journal was to have a new job, and I actually got

2123
02:53:37,180 --> 02:53:40,860
that right before the beginning of the year.

2124
02:53:40,860 --> 02:53:43,660
Goal number one is to lose 50 pounds.

2125
02:53:43,660 --> 02:53:48,100
Goal number two is to be enlisted in the Air Force or Army Reserves by the end of the year,

2126
02:53:48,100 --> 02:53:53,620
at least to get my man over his anti-military thing.

2127
02:53:53,620 --> 02:53:55,400
Anything you guys on the couch want to share?

2128
02:53:55,400 --> 02:53:57,840
I have three of them.

2129
02:53:57,840 --> 02:54:01,360
Two of them are most definitely going to happen, and the third one is going to take a lot more

2130
02:54:01,360 --> 02:54:02,760
work.

2131
02:54:02,760 --> 02:54:08,960
Goal number one, I'm going to graduate again this year, so basically my goal is to pass

2132
02:54:08,960 --> 02:54:14,920
my last class that I have to take in order to graduate, and hopefully convince my teacher

2133
02:54:14,920 --> 02:54:18,560
that I don't have to be there for the day of the final, because otherwise I'll be stuck

2134
02:54:18,560 --> 02:54:21,040
here instead of at E3.

2135
02:54:21,040 --> 02:54:22,040
Painful.

2136
02:54:22,040 --> 02:54:23,040
Yeah.

2137
02:54:23,040 --> 02:54:27,540
Second one is this is the year that I'm going to be getting out of debt, thankfully

2138
02:54:28,320 --> 02:54:33,840
So I have to finish that out. I would anticipate it probably will be done by about August

2139
02:54:33,840 --> 02:54:37,020
So I'll actually be 28 years old and completely debt-free

2140
02:54:37,600 --> 02:54:42,420
Which is not something that most 28 year olds can say. Exactly. And I'll own my own car

2141
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:47,060
No, no making payments or anything like that and that's coming up in about two months

2142
02:54:47,060 --> 02:54:54,060
And then my third, and probably the most important, and the one that's been the biggest problem for me,

2143
02:54:54,060 --> 02:54:58,060
I'd like to lose another 80 pounds.

2144
02:54:58,060 --> 02:55:06,060
Even if I don't lose the weight and just get down into size 12 or 14, I'd be ecstatic at that.

2145
02:55:06,060 --> 02:55:16,060
But I have been working my butt off to try to lose the weight, and it's hard, especially with my conditions and everything.

2146
02:55:16,060 --> 02:55:17,780
I'm gonna do it

2147
02:55:17,780 --> 02:55:22,200
Good luck to you. We're here to support you orange launch radio. Anybody that you know is

2148
02:55:22,800 --> 02:55:28,800
Trying to do that right now. Your friends are the best support you got for things like that. I think sometimes so

2149
02:55:29,460 --> 02:55:34,340
And you can look to for encouragement and we definitely encourage those you guys that want to be more fit

2150
02:55:34,340 --> 02:55:37,820
You know and especially Jamie is always telling you guys to go outside once in a while

2151
02:55:38,220 --> 02:55:43,660
Even though you do have to sit indoors to listen to this show. It's Sunday night. Okay, that's that's that was the Lord's Day to rest

2152
02:55:43,660 --> 02:55:47,740
so that's fine but you know go outside once in a while and get fit and that

2153
02:55:47,740 --> 02:55:51,460
kind of goes along with my goals too is that I have a goal where I would just

2154
02:55:51,460 --> 02:55:56,980
like to be more active and they say it takes 21 days to set a habit so I'm

2155
02:55:56,980 --> 02:56:01,400
trying to going to get in the habit of working out more every day and whether

2156
02:56:01,400 --> 02:56:05,500
that be that I get into riding a bike whether it be I get into lifting weights

2157
02:56:05,500 --> 02:56:09,960
whether it be I play DDR and actually do play DDR every day at least it's

2158
02:56:09,960 --> 02:56:14,100
something I want to get so where I'm doing like one fit activity a day so I

2159
02:56:14,100 --> 02:56:19,680
can work off this little little tiny pooch I got a little pooch actually I do

2160
02:56:19,680 --> 02:56:24,240
have a slight announcement to make okay for anyone who uses live journal I've

2161
02:56:24,240 --> 02:56:28,360
made and I will actually I'm thinking of making this just a big support group I

2162
02:56:28,360 --> 02:56:35,320
made a community called geek fit on live journal and I just made it this

2163
02:56:35,320 --> 02:56:42,640
afternoon but just for anyone who wants tips, advice, just to share, you know, what

2164
02:56:42,640 --> 02:56:46,240
you're doing, what's working for you. You don't even have to post every day but I

2165
02:56:46,240 --> 02:56:50,200
would encourage people to make use of this that I've opened up for everybody.

2166
02:56:50,200 --> 02:56:56,840
Just the livejournal.com slash community slash geekfit. G-E-E-K-F-I-T. Geekfit. I love

2167
02:56:56,840 --> 02:57:00,640
the name. That's gonna be cool. So live journal is a great way of support. Also a

2168
02:57:00,640 --> 02:57:04,480
lot of folks in our chat room are bringing up getupmove.com. Of course the

2169
02:57:04,480 --> 02:57:09,040
DDR fitness site, although getupmove.com, a little bit commercial because it's kind

2170
02:57:09,040 --> 02:57:13,040
of a red octane theme, but I have kind of looked at, I've lurked on the forums a

2171
02:57:13,040 --> 02:57:16,600
little bit, I think the forums are really cool. So I think if you want to find

2172
02:57:16,600 --> 02:57:20,080
people in the same boat that are kind of using DDR as a way to get more active

2173
02:57:20,080 --> 02:57:23,520
and lose weight, I think the forums are really great help over there on

2174
02:57:23,520 --> 02:57:29,920
getupmove.com, so check those out, definitely. Boy, okay, I guess we should

2175
02:57:29,920 --> 02:57:32,280
move on or else we're gonna run out of showtime and not get to everybody's

2176
02:57:32,280 --> 02:57:34,920
questions. We got to breeze through these last few questions here. Any other goals?

2177
02:57:34,920 --> 02:57:39,320
Anybody want to get out there? Okay. I did, I do have some other goals and that

2178
02:57:39,320 --> 02:57:45,360
would probably be just I want to, I'm kind of looking forward to 2006 where I

2179
02:57:45,360 --> 02:57:50,200
want to buy a house in 2006 and not be a renter anymore. So I want to do one more

2180
02:57:50,200 --> 02:57:53,520
year of renting something and I want to try and buy in 2006. That's going to take

2181
02:57:53,520 --> 02:57:56,080
you know establishing more credit and things like that and being a good boy

2182
02:57:56,080 --> 02:58:00,320
and things like that. And we'll see what happens with that. And then of course you

2183
02:58:00,320 --> 02:58:03,720
know there's relationship goals too, but at the same time you can't, I don't think you

2184
02:58:03,720 --> 02:58:06,500
can really set those kind of goals, because then you'll have these expectations that may

2185
02:58:06,500 --> 02:58:11,240
not be met, you're just setting yourself up for disappointment. So, while the wish is

2186
02:58:11,240 --> 02:58:18,220
there, it's not really a goal. What can you say? All right. Moving on, MPQ wants to know,

2187
02:58:18,220 --> 02:58:26,460
why did it take my Popin' Music 5 soundtrack so long to arrive? Well, I imagine the mix

2188
02:58:26,460 --> 02:58:30,940
This is several, or it's a couple years old now, so it's probably just hard to find.

2189
02:58:30,940 --> 02:58:33,100
It's the holidays.

2190
02:58:33,100 --> 02:58:34,100
That too?

2191
02:58:34,100 --> 02:58:35,100
That makes sense to me.

2192
02:58:35,100 --> 02:58:36,100
Yeah, there you go.

2193
02:58:36,100 --> 02:58:37,100
It'll take a while.

2194
02:58:37,100 --> 02:58:39,100
Bad weather, holding up packages.

2195
02:58:39,100 --> 02:58:40,100
Exactly.

2196
02:58:40,100 --> 02:58:41,100
Tsunamis.

2197
02:58:41,100 --> 02:58:43,540
Everybody knows it's Al-Qaeda.

2198
02:58:43,540 --> 02:58:45,540
Loki's ranting about Al-Qaeda?

2199
02:58:45,540 --> 02:58:47,260
Alright.

2200
02:58:47,260 --> 02:58:48,260
We'll see.

2201
02:58:48,260 --> 02:58:54,780
Um, let's see, DJ Ronma S wants to know, did you all get everything that you wanted for

2202
02:58:54,780 --> 02:58:55,780
Christmas?

2203
02:58:55,780 --> 02:59:04,780
No, I did not, and I don't care because I can work on it this year if I really want to.

2204
02:59:04,780 --> 02:59:07,780
Anything else?

2205
02:59:07,780 --> 02:59:11,780
There were a couple of things I wanted, but I for the most part got what I wanted.

2206
02:59:11,780 --> 02:59:17,780
Me personally, I didn't really have a list of demands, I just said I wanted to hang out with people more, and I did.

2207
02:59:17,780 --> 02:59:21,780
I went to some pretty cool parties in December, so you know, it's all good.

2208
02:59:21,780 --> 02:59:28,180
I don't really had I the one material thing I wanted I went out and I bought myself. I got it

2209
02:59:28,180 --> 02:59:32,040
So the end my raw plutonium still in the mail they tell me

2210
02:59:35,020 --> 02:59:37,020
Can't get your portal to hell did you?

2211
02:59:39,720 --> 02:59:42,900
Final fantasy has kept me away from contacting the dead. I'm sorry

2212
02:59:44,620 --> 02:59:45,540
Actually, it's funny

2213
02:59:45,540 --> 02:59:47,420
I was watching something on TV

2214
02:59:47,420 --> 02:59:54,420
Where I don't remember the show was because I just happened to pass it while Dan was watching where they were talking about your

2215
02:59:54,700 --> 02:59:56,140
experiment

2216
02:59:56,140 --> 02:59:59,900
As gonna be something that they were showing doing a news report on

2217
03:00:02,420 --> 03:00:06,260
Yeah, that was it it was a movie and they were doing they were talking about the movie

2218
03:00:07,020 --> 03:00:11,260
That was it. And I was like, oh, that's a that's a Loki's portal to hell

2219
03:00:11,260 --> 03:00:18,260
I just want to be like you, you cool guy you.

2220
03:00:18,260 --> 03:00:21,660
Alright I got to wrap this up so I'm sorry because I'm cutting a few people's questions

2221
03:00:21,660 --> 03:00:22,660
off.

2222
03:00:22,660 --> 03:00:23,660
I'm really sorry to you guys.

2223
03:00:23,660 --> 03:00:24,660
We're going to have to make this the last question.

2224
03:00:24,660 --> 03:00:28,620
Vidpowah wants to know, I recently picked up Tycho Drummaster, what do you guys think

2225
03:00:28,620 --> 03:00:29,620
of this game?

2226
03:00:29,620 --> 03:00:30,620
Any advice?

2227
03:00:30,620 --> 03:00:31,620
Real quick.

2228
03:00:31,620 --> 03:00:33,020
It makes my hands hurt.

2229
03:00:33,020 --> 03:00:34,020
Freaking badass.

2230
03:00:34,020 --> 03:00:35,180
I love the game.

2231
03:00:35,180 --> 03:00:37,400
I love it too.

2232
03:00:37,400 --> 03:00:40,180
I still can't get over Katamari on the rocks so you know what?

2233
03:00:40,180 --> 03:00:49,020
I have yet to check out the US version, but my advice to you would be if you like the

2234
03:00:49,020 --> 03:00:52,820
US version, there's about five of them in Japan that are just waiting for you to pick

2235
03:00:52,820 --> 03:00:53,820
them up.

2236
03:00:53,820 --> 03:00:57,500
Take breaks, otherwise you're going to kill your forearms.

2237
03:00:57,500 --> 03:01:01,740
I had a friend, my friend that got Donkey Konga complained of the same thing from playing

2238
03:01:01,740 --> 03:01:06,260
it too much, and even though it's a little bit different style still, I mean, as with

2239
03:01:06,260 --> 03:01:10,500
any game that requires you to move motion, even DDR, take breaks, you know, take breaks

2240
03:01:10,500 --> 03:01:14,020
once in a while. That's why you get a break stage on workout mode and things like that.

2241
03:01:14,020 --> 03:01:20,580
So, any other advice? Okay. Well, that's going to bring that segment to a close. Thank you

2242
03:01:20,580 --> 03:01:27,160
guys for the good questions tonight. We appreciate that. And we'll do more Ask Orange Lounge

2243
03:01:27,160 --> 03:01:31,660
in a future week. Remember, we're here doing this show every Sunday night from 6.30 p.m.

2244
03:01:31,660 --> 03:01:36,860
Pacific Standard Time to 930 p.m. Pacific Standard Time. Of course, this isn't the

2245
03:01:36,860 --> 03:01:40,720
only show that happens. We have multiple live shows throughout the week. Monday

2246
03:01:40,720 --> 03:01:45,120
night, Diversion, Bahmani remixes. Man, some good stuff. If you thought that

2247
03:01:45,120 --> 03:01:47,860
Paranoia Revolution clip was cool, you should hear all the stuff that's on

2248
03:01:47,860 --> 03:01:53,460
Monday night. It's awesome. Tuesday night, Dark Sakura, Pump Up the Volume. And also

2249
03:01:53,460 --> 03:01:57,640
this Tuesday I will be playing the repeat. Yes, the one chance to catch the

2250
03:01:57,640 --> 03:02:03,680
repeat on Orange Lounge Radio, you'll catch that this Tuesday, your one and only shot.

2251
03:02:03,680 --> 03:02:09,480
But DDR Freak Radio, I'm sure we'll play it several times this month, I'm assuming. Okay,

2252
03:02:09,480 --> 03:02:15,320
I'm getting nods. All right, and Wednesday night we have the Old and Mold Orange Lounge

2253
03:02:15,320 --> 03:02:19,120
Radio Rewinds, shows from like two years ago, we're playing for you guys. If you want to

2254
03:02:19,120 --> 03:02:23,900
hear what it was like when we were talking about how cool DDR Max 2 was and why are they

2255
03:02:23,900 --> 03:02:29,380
calling the next mix extreme. That's extremely lame and things like that. It's hilarious.

2256
03:02:29,380 --> 03:02:33,980
And you can hear me for the first time ever, but who really cares, right?

2257
03:02:33,980 --> 03:02:40,660
Right. And what else? You'll actually see a lot of faces two years ago. I mean, you're

2258
03:02:40,660 --> 03:02:43,380
one of the few people that was here two years ago that's still here. A lot of folks that

2259
03:02:43,380 --> 03:02:46,900
were here two years ago aren't here anymore, which is kind of sad. Except Logie, he's still

2260
03:02:46,900 --> 03:02:50,060
here. He schmoozed his way onto the show.

2261
03:02:50,060 --> 03:02:53,820
And see, when I was on the show, he was sitting on the floor. Now who's sitting on the floor?

2262
03:02:53,820 --> 03:03:01,500
Alright, alright. Because it's his apartment now. Anyway, also Thursday night outside the

2263
03:03:01,500 --> 03:03:06,020
box has been hitting some road bumps lately. I'm sorry you guys, it's just that Rice Princess

2264
03:03:06,020 --> 03:03:10,080
and Lanky Style have had other commitments, so we're going to try and maybe play with

2265
03:03:10,080 --> 03:03:13,260
that a little bit. Hopefully we can bring outside the box back this week. If not, we

2266
03:03:13,260 --> 03:03:18,100
might kind of change the format a little bit and try something else. Keep your eyes on

2267
03:03:18,100 --> 03:03:23,920
orangelaunchradio.com. Something exciting is coming very soon. Very soon. That's all

2268
03:03:23,920 --> 03:03:29,260
I can say right now. Friday nights, DER Freak Radio, working together with us to bring you

2269
03:03:29,260 --> 03:03:33,140
the Orange Launch Radio Rewind, 6 o'clock. If you missed this show, any part of it, or

2270
03:03:33,140 --> 03:03:38,140
a previous week's show, tune in over at The Freak, 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time. I

2271
03:03:38,140 --> 03:03:41,340
think that's about all the whoring I needed to do tonight for all the various stuff we're

2272
03:03:41,340 --> 03:03:46,820
involved with. Yes? Anything else? Anything? Any of our guests have anything they want

2273
03:03:46,820 --> 03:03:53,020
Wanna plug? No? Think we hit it all? Alright. Go on, girl.

2274
03:03:53,020 --> 03:03:57,260
When you're not listening to Orange Lounge, go listen to DDR3C radio. That is all.

2275
03:03:57,260 --> 03:04:03,660
Yes. You know what? Honestly, just support internet radio in general. Just turn off your

2276
03:04:03,660 --> 03:04:08,980
regular corporate commercially fed...and I know a lot of people bitch that Live 365 plays

2277
03:04:08,980 --> 03:04:12,500
too many commercials, but you know what, guys? It is nothing compared to corporate radio.

2278
03:04:12,500 --> 03:04:17,500
turn on your FCC regulated censored airwaves sometime and take a listen to the crap they

2279
03:04:17,500 --> 03:04:19,740
have on there and then tell me live 365 sucks.

2280
03:04:19,740 --> 03:04:27,080
I have some great news for everybody too. Also, G4, um, Tech TV or just G4 TV, the two

2281
03:04:27,080 --> 03:04:34,260
girls on G4TechTV.com promised that they wouldn't suck this year. I know everybody's so enthusiastic

2282
03:04:34,260 --> 03:04:37,540
because the channel's not gonna suck anymore. Because they said so.

2283
03:04:37,540 --> 03:04:39,540
But what if you're one of their boyfriends?

2284
03:04:39,540 --> 03:04:42,980
But they also promised to do some lesbian action on there.

2285
03:04:42,980 --> 03:04:45,060
That was their promise.

2286
03:04:45,060 --> 03:04:47,620
Oh, yeah, true.

2287
03:04:47,620 --> 03:04:49,060
I will one-up that.

2288
03:04:49,060 --> 03:04:51,660
This year, we will continue to not suck,

2289
03:04:51,660 --> 03:04:54,100
and we will bring you a hot lesbian action at some point

2290
03:04:54,100 --> 03:04:55,340
during the year.

2291
03:04:55,340 --> 03:04:59,380
That gives us 360 days to work with here, so.

2292
03:04:59,380 --> 03:05:01,860
At some point, we will bring you hot lesbian action.

2293
03:05:01,860 --> 03:05:03,900
And maybe some hot gay action, too,

2294
03:05:03,900 --> 03:05:08,180
for you folks that are into that.

2295
03:05:08,180 --> 03:05:12,180
We'll not only give you one instance of lesbian action, we'll give you two!

2296
03:05:12,180 --> 03:05:17,180
How's that? How do you like them apples, G4TV? Huh? Huh?

2297
03:05:17,180 --> 03:05:25,180
Alright. Anyway, uh, also the email boxes are open. We have email. If you ever want to say hi to us in email, you have a suggestion, comment, send us email.

Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.

2343
03:10:29,620 --> 03:10:33,840
Alright guys, this is the part of the show called the After Birth.

2344
03:10:33,840 --> 03:10:37,560
Now what I have to kind of put out there is that our After Birth segments are going to

2345
03:10:37,560 --> 03:10:42,840
be changing a little bit in the future because of something else that we're doing and I can't

2346
03:10:42,840 --> 03:10:46,480
spill the beans just yet, but trust me, you'll be cool with this once you find out.

2347
03:10:46,480 --> 03:10:50,260
So our After Births are going to be a little bit shorter and just so you guys know, when

2348
03:10:50,260 --> 03:10:55,720
our shows are over, you're going to be going back straight to the Orange Lawns Radio Bamani

2349
03:10:55,720 --> 03:10:56,960
Music and More program.

2350
03:10:56,960 --> 03:11:00,360
That does mean you get dumped from the stream, you're gonna have to reconnect in 30 seconds.

2351
03:11:00,360 --> 03:11:01,640
But it's no big deal, right?

2352
03:11:01,640 --> 03:11:05,040
You guys still love Orange Lounge, and we'll listen to it, right?

2353
03:11:05,040 --> 03:11:06,040
No, they hate us.

2354
03:11:06,040 --> 03:11:07,040
I know, they hate us.

2355
03:11:07,040 --> 03:11:08,040
Ugh!

2356
03:11:08,040 --> 03:11:09,040
I thought that was a good show tonight.

2357
03:11:09,040 --> 03:11:10,040
It was a very good show.

2358
03:11:10,040 --> 03:11:11,040
I think it was a very good show.

2359
03:11:11,040 --> 03:11:15,840
I love it when Iguana Girl and Jazz comes in from out of town, and Islander's here,

2360
03:11:15,840 --> 03:11:20,640
and Angel's here, of course, and Loki has food so he's happy.

2361
03:11:20,640 --> 03:11:23,120
Loki, you look pretty pissed off at the beginning of the show.

2362
03:11:23,120 --> 03:11:26,440
I think you tripped on something and I saw you just go into anger mode.

2363
03:11:26,440 --> 03:11:32,180
what happened? I tripped on two sets of cords. First, set number one going from the cabinet

2364
03:11:32,180 --> 03:11:38,360
to the chair, and set number two going from the table next to the cabinet to somewhere

2365
03:11:38,360 --> 03:11:43,640
on towards the wall. It's like two trip wires that we have in here, and I hit them both.

2366
03:11:43,640 --> 03:11:47,100
That and I had a fucking headache, and it seems to be going away now that I have food.

2367
03:11:47,100 --> 03:11:53,460
I think it's probably because I didn't eat since 11, and when I did eat it at 11, it

2368
03:11:53,460 --> 03:12:01,700
it was four-day-old twists. So, literally, my jaw was sore from chewing those twists.

2369
03:12:01,700 --> 03:12:05,940
It's like, you know, if you work out, you know, while you can't move your arm, well,

2370
03:12:05,940 --> 03:12:11,160
that was like my jaw. It sucked. But, so I made my fried rice thing, and I have enough

2371
03:12:11,160 --> 03:12:14,880
now for the whole week, so I'm going to eat it.

2372
03:12:14,880 --> 03:12:18,940
I'd like to comment in the chat room, there's still a few people in there over at www.orange.com

2373
03:12:18,940 --> 03:12:23,380
in chat. Dark Knight says, dang, the studio cleared out fast, didn't it? Well, yeah, this

2374
03:12:23,380 --> 03:12:27,020
is pretty typical where most of our guests take off during the closing credits there,

2375
03:12:27,020 --> 03:12:30,540
just like a lot of our listeners do. Well, we understand it's kind of late for you guys

2376
03:12:30,540 --> 03:12:34,260
out there, especially on the East Coast. It's, what, 1230 your time out there, so pretty

2377
03:12:34,260 --> 03:12:41,340
late. But, you know, obviously, Goanna Girl's kind of hurting there a little bit, and Jazz

2378
03:12:41,340 --> 03:12:45,700
had to drive back to the Bay tonight, so it's very typical where, you know, people just

2379
03:12:45,700 --> 03:12:48,580
got to get somewhere else so it's kind of interesting with radio though

2380
03:12:48,580 --> 03:12:53,580
sometimes you can't always tell people will run into the studio sometimes while

2381
03:12:53,580 --> 03:12:58,140
the opening is playing and be in their seat right in time for the show to start

2382
03:12:58,140 --> 03:13:02,300
and you know live TV and live other live radio programs work this exact same way

2383
03:13:02,300 --> 03:13:06,180
so it's just kind of funny the illusion that would sometimes gives that we've

2384
03:13:06,180 --> 03:13:09,260
been sitting here for you know a half hour waiting for the show to start no I

2385
03:13:09,260 --> 03:13:13,660
don't think so but anyway we do appreciate you guys sitting through the

2386
03:13:13,660 --> 03:13:18,480
show and sticking with us. Have a great one, you guys. We really support you guys and thank

2387
03:13:18,480 --> 03:13:23,700
you guys for supporting us. What can I say? You guys have stuck with us through the holidays

2388
03:13:23,700 --> 03:13:28,120
and everything. Don't forget, listen to our Bomani Music Amore program. We've got some

2389
03:13:28,120 --> 03:13:33,240
exciting new things coming to you guys very soon. We're doing it for you guys because

2390
03:13:33,240 --> 03:13:41,700
we love you. Except Loki, he hates you. We love you. This new thing we're doing somewhere

2391
03:13:41,700 --> 03:13:47,580
involved needs to be the song girls just so everyone can suffer

2392
03:13:47,580 --> 03:13:50,700
we'll see alright guys have a great night thank you for tuning in at this

2393
03:13:50,700 --> 03:13:51,300
point

2394
03:13:51,300 --> 03:13:54,540
you're gonna be released from the live stream which means you're gonna be dumped

2395
03:13:54,540 --> 03:13:56,220
What you have to do is you have
