[SPEAKER_05]: What?

24
00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:53,790
[SPEAKER_18]: I have a mouthful of asparagus.

25
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,421
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not what I heard.

26
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:02,405
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounded like she was mumbling local street names and stuff from around here.

27
00:05:02,905 --> 00:05:09,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, also in that corner, the other co-host, the fabulous, wonderful, tech master, Loki!

28
00:05:11,673 --> 00:05:14,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's waving at you right now because he's not near a microphone.

29
00:05:15,517 --> 00:05:16,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Not prepared.

30
00:05:16,778 --> 00:05:17,238
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm kidding.

31
00:05:17,278 --> 00:05:18,499
[SPEAKER_05]: He's doing other stuff.

32
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:18,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

33
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,182
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have a bunch of special guests, though.

34
00:05:22,465 --> 00:05:26,969
[SPEAKER_05]: We always love having special guests in studio, especially some old favorites which we have here tonight.

35
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:30,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I think some of you guys are now designated old favorites.

36
00:05:31,272 --> 00:05:32,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Including... Old, maybe.

37
00:05:35,515 --> 00:05:39,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Including everybody's favorite psycho forum goddess.

38
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:41,460
[SPEAKER_11]: Head bitch.

39
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Head bitch.

40
00:05:42,501 --> 00:05:43,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Say hello to Iguana Girl.

41
00:05:44,142 --> 00:05:44,823
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, hi.

42
00:05:45,823 --> 00:05:46,884
[SPEAKER_11]: Yo, what up?

43
00:05:47,485 --> 00:05:47,945
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing?

44
00:05:47,965 --> 00:05:48,906
[SPEAKER_05]: That mic's a little quiet.

45
00:05:49,726 --> 00:05:50,507
[SPEAKER_20]: I was noticing that.

46
00:05:50,607 --> 00:05:51,928
[SPEAKER_05]: You gotta... from the gut.

47
00:05:52,825 --> 00:05:55,928
[SPEAKER_20]: You don't want me to go first.

48
00:05:55,968 --> 00:05:57,790
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just blasting everybody out now.

49
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,891
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta yell like you're yelling at newbies.

50
00:06:01,693 --> 00:06:03,094
[SPEAKER_20]: If only you knew.

51
00:06:04,956 --> 00:06:10,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, also joining us tonight, say hello to Islander.

52
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:10,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello everyone.

53
00:06:11,221 --> 00:06:11,862
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing?

54
00:06:12,342 --> 00:06:13,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Good and loud tonight.

55
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:13,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

56
00:06:14,344 --> 00:06:15,125
[SPEAKER_05]: I learned my lesson.

57
00:06:15,822 --> 00:06:16,703
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a new microphone.

58
00:06:16,723 --> 00:06:21,186
[SPEAKER_05]: We finally, after about four weeks, replaced that microphone that was cutting out for our guests.

59
00:06:21,727 --> 00:06:22,667
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a little quiet.

60
00:06:24,348 --> 00:06:26,550
[SPEAKER_05]: So, because we had to play some mic roulette, actually.

61
00:06:27,051 --> 00:06:28,071
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.

62
00:06:28,372 --> 00:06:31,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, also say hello to joining us on this show.

63
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,816
[SPEAKER_05]: It hasn't been here in several years.

64
00:06:35,857 --> 00:06:36,718
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's been a while.

65
00:06:36,998 --> 00:06:39,020
[SPEAKER_05]: He grew since the last time I saw him.

66
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Say hello to Jazz.

67
00:06:42,862 --> 00:06:43,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, everybody.

68
00:06:44,178 --> 00:06:47,281
[SPEAKER_05]: I know him better as Kamikaze, though, from the Final Fantasy universe.

69
00:06:47,561 --> 00:06:48,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

70
00:06:49,382 --> 00:06:49,803
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

71
00:06:50,463 --> 00:06:51,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Say hello to another old favorite.

72
00:06:52,265 --> 00:06:55,607
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's such an old favorite that she's getting moldy.

73
00:06:56,408 --> 00:06:57,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Say hello to DDR Angel.

74
00:06:59,050 --> 00:06:59,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

75
00:07:00,011 --> 00:07:00,531
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm late.

76
00:07:01,052 --> 00:07:01,192
[SPEAKER_19]: Ah!

77
00:07:02,093 --> 00:07:07,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, they would have never known that because you were here right before your cue, but you just had to go and spill all the beans, so now they know you're tired.

78
00:07:07,777 --> 00:07:08,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Our webcam wasn't even on.

79
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:09,819
[SPEAKER_05]: They couldn't see.

80
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,120
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

81
00:07:12,185 --> 00:07:16,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, can I just start off by saying, I love our chat room.

82
00:07:17,446 --> 00:07:20,847
[SPEAKER_05]: I love our chat room, www.orangelonsradio.com, click on chat.

83
00:07:21,287 --> 00:07:28,329
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this, MPQ in chat says, Every time I hear the opening, I think my mom will think I'm looking at porn or something.

84
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:30,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, we have that sexy voice in there.

85
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:32,410
[SPEAKER_05]: You're listening to Orange Lens, right?

86
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:37,331
[SPEAKER_05]: And then somebody else replies here, Shade23 says, Well, why aren't you?

87
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Masterbating to Pornography

88
00:08:10,345 --> 00:08:12,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Big 2DX game released last year.

89
00:08:12,406 --> 00:08:14,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I can say last year, because we're in 2005.

90
00:08:14,988 --> 00:08:16,569
[SPEAKER_05]: So big 2DX game released last year.

91
00:08:16,589 --> 00:08:18,030
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to hear some music from 2DX Red.

92
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:24,594
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we come back, all that randomness and chatter you've come to expect from your buddies here at Orange Lounge Radio.

93
00:08:24,614 --> 00:08:25,155
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back.

94
00:08:29,037 --> 00:08:30,058
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll be back.

95
00:09:23,538 --> 00:09:24,490
Thank you for watching!

96
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,447
Thank you for watching!

97
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,906
Thanks for watching!

98
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:50,641
Thanks for watching!

00:13:20,248 --> 00:13:21,490
Thanks for watching!

100
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:54,451
Thanks for watching!

101
00:14:23,974 --> 00:14:33,337
[SPEAKER_17]: And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

102
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.

103
00:14:38,183 --> 00:14:39,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we talk about that?

104
00:14:39,423 --> 00:14:41,785
[SPEAKER_09]: No subject will ever be taboo.

105
00:14:42,065 --> 00:14:45,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.

106
00:14:46,207 --> 00:14:48,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.

107
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:54,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

108
00:14:55,172 --> 00:14:56,453
[SPEAKER_09]: I collect your fucking head.

109
00:14:58,402 --> 00:14:59,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like this fucker here.

110
00:15:00,203 --> 00:15:04,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?

111
00:15:04,967 --> 00:15:08,329
[SPEAKER_06]: The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

112
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:15,734
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

113
00:15:16,955 --> 00:15:20,738
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

114
00:15:20,758 --> 00:15:23,380
[SPEAKER_11]: Orange Lounge Radio

115
00:15:24,813 --> 00:15:29,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 125.

116
00:15:30,979 --> 00:15:33,701
[SPEAKER_05]: That's some kind of landmark number, isn't it?

117
00:15:33,721 --> 00:15:33,701
125?

118
00:15:33,781 --> 00:15:34,102
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

119
00:15:35,343 --> 00:15:35,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe not.

120
00:15:36,043 --> 00:15:36,784
[SPEAKER_05]: A dollar and a quarter?

121
00:15:36,824 --> 00:15:37,165
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

122
00:15:37,785 --> 00:15:38,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, we're here.

123
00:15:40,202 --> 00:15:43,104
[SPEAKER_05]: for your listening pleasure or displeasure, as the case may be.

124
00:15:43,925 --> 00:15:47,407
[SPEAKER_05]: www.orangeonstrater.com for all the interaction stuff with the show.

125
00:15:47,467 --> 00:15:52,951
[SPEAKER_05]: We know you guys love to interact with the show, whether it be via the chat room or via the Skype line, which I should sign into at some point.

126
00:15:53,372 --> 00:15:57,875
[SPEAKER_05]: But we will have Orange Ons Radio on the Skype line so you can call in later in the show if you want and all that good stuff.

127
00:15:58,736 --> 00:16:00,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Just sitting here, sitting back, talking about...

128
00:16:01,232 --> 00:16:04,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Music-based video games and, you know, Bomani-type games.

129
00:16:04,494 --> 00:16:07,715
[SPEAKER_05]: And just, you know, really anything that doesn't suck is fair game here.

130
00:16:08,216 --> 00:16:09,696
[SPEAKER_05]: And even some stuff that does suck.

131
00:16:09,756 --> 00:16:11,157
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a whole segment dedicated to that.

132
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:12,898
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll get into that a little later.

133
00:16:13,678 --> 00:16:18,120
[SPEAKER_05]: But first we have to start off tonight's show as we start off every week's show.

134
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,441
[SPEAKER_05]: 125 episodes and nothing's changed.

135
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:20,762
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your week?

136
00:16:20,822 --> 00:16:21,522
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your day?

137
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:25,464
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to start it off with the lovely DarkSakura, who actually wasn't here last week.

138
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you were sick last week, right?

139
00:16:27,325 --> 00:16:27,705
[SPEAKER_18]: I was.

140
00:16:28,265 --> 00:16:29,026
[SPEAKER_18]: I was actually...

141
00:16:29,895 --> 00:16:31,716
[SPEAKER_18]: Pretty damn tired last week.

142
00:16:31,876 --> 00:16:32,637
[SPEAKER_05]: That's too bad to hear.

143
00:16:33,057 --> 00:16:33,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything okay?

144
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:35,038
[SPEAKER_05]: But you seem good now.

145
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:36,258
[SPEAKER_18]: But I have sexy jeans.

146
00:16:36,979 --> 00:16:39,100
[SPEAKER_05]: You do have sexy... I haven't taken a look at your sexy jeans here.

147
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,660
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not wearing them.

148
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:39,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

149
00:16:40,101 --> 00:16:41,441
[SPEAKER_18]: They're in the washer.

150
00:16:41,962 --> 00:16:42,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

151
00:16:42,422 --> 00:16:43,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we want to see your sexy jeans.

152
00:16:44,283 --> 00:16:45,564
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why we have a webcam.

153
00:16:45,844 --> 00:16:47,244
[SPEAKER_05]: There's never anything interesting on a webcam.

154
00:16:47,264 --> 00:16:48,925
[SPEAKER_18]: Half of them are recessive.

155
00:16:48,985 --> 00:16:50,366
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, a quarter of them are recessive.

156
00:16:50,546 --> 00:16:51,086
[SPEAKER_05]: How's that work?

157
00:16:51,407 --> 00:16:52,747
[SPEAKER_18]: My jeans are a quarter recessive.

158
00:16:52,807 --> 00:16:53,468
[SPEAKER_18]: Everybody's are.

159
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:58,831
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your week?

160
00:16:58,851 --> 00:16:59,271
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your day?

161
00:16:59,291 --> 00:16:59,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

162
00:17:00,271 --> 00:17:01,613
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, DarkSakura!

163
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:23,725
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I'm going to be changing from the exciting world of student loans going into the exciting world, again, of home mortgages.

164
00:17:23,925 --> 00:17:25,346
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to be working in the escrow department.

165
00:17:25,366 --> 00:17:30,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is something probably I would estimate that 98% of our listeners know nothing about.

166
00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:34,991
[SPEAKER_18]: I would have to say that 98% of homeowners know nothing about.

167
00:17:36,872 --> 00:17:40,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Considering our average age of the listener would be about, what, 12?

168
00:17:40,714 --> 00:17:41,374
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

169
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:41,915
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm kidding.

170
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:42,755
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

171
00:17:43,171 --> 00:17:43,911
[SPEAKER_05]: www.DarkSakura.com

172
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:36,353
[SPEAKER_18]: your mortgage company has the option of paying your taxes and insurance with your house payment so they will actually set it up to where you have the money in a separate holding account which is an escrow account to pay your taxes and insurance and that's what I'm going to be doing is making sure that they're managed properly because if they're not it gives people lots of trouble with the government makes people really poor because trust me when you go to buy a house don't be a retard about it come talk to me anyway

173
00:18:38,236 --> 00:18:43,280
[SPEAKER_18]: So, also making some changes, other changes.

174
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:50,044
[SPEAKER_18]: And as of tomorrow, I am back on the straight and narrow for my big resolution.

175
00:18:51,085 --> 00:18:53,287
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to say this on the air tonight.

176
00:18:53,627 --> 00:18:53,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-oh.

177
00:18:54,488 --> 00:18:56,109
[SPEAKER_18]: See, last year I lost 50 pounds.

178
00:18:56,349 --> 00:18:57,410
[SPEAKER_18]: This year I'm going to lose another 50.

179
00:19:00,591 --> 00:19:04,173
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to be a toothpick before long if you keep losing all this weight.

180
00:19:04,213 --> 00:19:04,954
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think so.

181
00:19:05,234 --> 00:19:06,214
[SPEAKER_18]: Not the way I'm doing it.

182
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,397
[SPEAKER_18]: I want the Linda Hamilton Terminator 2 look.

183
00:19:09,457 --> 00:19:10,938
[SPEAKER_18]: I want it to be tough.

184
00:19:11,238 --> 00:19:12,439
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to kick people's ass.

185
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:15,121
[SPEAKER_18]: And then take out a submachine gun and go blow away.

186
00:19:15,261 --> 00:19:15,821
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, sorry.

187
00:19:17,502 --> 00:19:21,545
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm also going to take gun safety classes this year.

188
00:19:22,566 --> 00:19:22,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no.

189
00:19:24,423 --> 00:19:29,166
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember this was the discussion last January, is that Jamie was going to get a gun.

190
00:19:29,687 --> 00:19:31,348
[SPEAKER_18]: I couldn't afford a gun last year.

191
00:19:31,368 --> 00:19:34,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Thankfully the discussion went away for a while, and now, great, it's back.

192
00:19:35,931 --> 00:19:37,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie got a gun.

193
00:19:37,372 --> 00:19:39,634
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, you know what?

194
00:19:41,495 --> 00:19:43,877
[SPEAKER_18]: When I go postal, the first place I'm coming is here.

195
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:47,339
[SPEAKER_18]: Seriously, though.

196
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:50,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, you couldn't resist that one.

197
00:19:51,753 --> 00:19:57,056
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, I'm gonna, you know, we're talking about getting like, you know, a little crappy .22 rifle, but I'm gonna work up.

198
00:19:57,856 --> 00:19:58,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Remind me again.

199
00:19:59,957 --> 00:20:00,918
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you need a gun for?

200
00:20:00,938 --> 00:20:02,979
[SPEAKER_18]: To shoot stuff, duh!

201
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:05,120
[SPEAKER_18]: Stress relief!

202
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Stress relief, she says.

203
00:20:08,221 --> 00:20:09,362
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you gonna be shooting?

204
00:20:09,402 --> 00:20:10,482
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not gonna be going to golf?

205
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:11,443
[SPEAKER_05]: An animal object.

206
00:20:11,463 --> 00:20:12,804
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not gonna be going to golf land, are you?

207
00:20:12,824 --> 00:20:13,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Stray dogs.

208
00:20:15,139 --> 00:20:23,963
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to remember that Roseville Golf Land, for those who have never been there, one of our local arcades we play at, it's two stories, and not a lot goes on on the second story.

209
00:20:24,043 --> 00:20:25,224
[SPEAKER_18]: Except me with a sniper rifle.

210
00:20:25,644 --> 00:20:26,324
[SPEAKER_18]: Exactly.

211
00:20:26,604 --> 00:20:27,384
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my fear.

212
00:20:27,624 --> 00:20:30,005
[SPEAKER_18]: Defile my machine, I dare you.

213
00:20:31,006 --> 00:20:35,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you think it would be quite humorous, though, if they put like a silent scope machine up there?

214
00:20:36,008 --> 00:20:36,928
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, that'd be rad.

215
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:41,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

216
00:20:42,611 --> 00:20:43,711
[SPEAKER_18]: I was sick on Christmas Day.

217
00:20:44,773 --> 00:20:45,213
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

218
00:20:46,034 --> 00:20:50,236
[SPEAKER_18]: I was sick with like this nasty fatigue, which actually lasted into Sunday.

219
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:59,060
[SPEAKER_18]: But I was, I got up, I went to breakfast, went to bed.

220
00:21:00,461 --> 00:21:03,262
[SPEAKER_18]: Got up, went to dinner over at Dan's aunt's house.

221
00:21:04,283 --> 00:21:06,664
[SPEAKER_18]: And then when he was, I said, just take me home.

222
00:21:06,844 --> 00:21:08,985
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not going to be able to hang out with your cousins and play video games.

223
00:21:09,683 --> 00:21:11,864
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's go play DDR at your cousin's house.

224
00:21:11,964 --> 00:21:12,384
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

225
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:14,745
[SPEAKER_18]: No, Jamie, go bed.

226
00:21:16,086 --> 00:21:16,586
[SPEAKER_18]: I went home.

227
00:21:16,626 --> 00:21:20,127
[SPEAKER_18]: I sat up for about an hour just, you know, checking my email, settling stuff.

228
00:21:20,408 --> 00:21:21,148
[SPEAKER_18]: My ass was in bed.

229
00:21:21,328 --> 00:21:22,408
[SPEAKER_18]: I was like, no, I can't deal with it.

230
00:21:22,869 --> 00:21:25,870
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I was asleep for most of Christmas.

231
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:32,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, in some ways, sometimes it's better that way to be asleep for Christmas.

232
00:21:32,172 --> 00:21:33,453
[SPEAKER_18]: But I did get nifty presents.

233
00:21:33,513 --> 00:21:34,293
[SPEAKER_18]: I got gift cards.

234
00:21:35,454 --> 00:21:38,495
[SPEAKER_18]: Which means that the day after, I was

235
00:21:39,147 --> 00:21:41,229
[SPEAKER_18]: Basically wearing myself out shopping, but it was fun.

236
00:21:41,329 --> 00:21:41,989
[SPEAKER_18]: It was very fun.

237
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:45,612
[SPEAKER_18]: I went shopping with Tia and Jessica, and we had a fun time.

238
00:21:47,574 --> 00:22:00,144
[SPEAKER_05]: The day after Christmas is kind of a nightmare shopping day, though, because I remember that I was at Best Buy, I think, that day, and I just... Oh my gosh, it was crazy.

239
00:22:00,564 --> 00:22:02,506
[SPEAKER_05]: The line was going around the block.

240
00:22:03,247 --> 00:22:04,508
[SPEAKER_18]: It was pretty crazy.

241
00:22:04,528 --> 00:22:06,049
[SPEAKER_18]: Just the thing is that I didn't have...

242
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:24,252
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, basically, I was really, really, I shouldn't by all rights have been out, but it's the day after freaking Christmas, sales, you know, womanly instinct is stronger than fatigue sometimes, and then I had an eggnog frappuccino.

243
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:31,376
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish Starbucks would never get rid of those because they're so good and I know they're going to be gone Monday probably.

244
00:22:31,776 --> 00:22:38,538
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm actually glad they're gone because they proved to be too much temptation especially with the Starbucks.

245
00:22:38,638 --> 00:22:45,279
[SPEAKER_18]: The one thing that keeps me away from the Starbucks by my present location of work is the fact that it's right by a freaking Target.

246
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:48,180
[SPEAKER_18]: So traffic is enough to keep me away.

247
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:49,960
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm

248
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:54,365
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a lot of people out there are very, very anti-Starbucks.

249
00:22:54,626 --> 00:22:58,168
[SPEAKER_05]: And for those of you guys that don't have a Starbucks in your neighborhood, just wait.

250
00:22:58,248 --> 00:22:59,108
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll have one soon.

251
00:22:59,709 --> 00:23:01,070
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a coffee shop for those that didn't know.

252
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,430
[SPEAKER_05]: It's huge.

253
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,091
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a Mississippi orgy going on.

254
00:23:05,225 --> 00:23:06,606
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking Starbucks.

255
00:23:06,646 --> 00:23:06,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.

256
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:08,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Mississippi orgy can wait.

257
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:09,667
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not week and day.

258
00:23:10,308 --> 00:23:10,668
[SPEAKER_18]: Two.

259
00:23:11,228 --> 00:23:12,469
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just wanted to say Starbucks.

260
00:23:12,589 --> 00:23:14,170
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not as bad as you people make it out to be.

261
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:16,651
[SPEAKER_05]: They have great, some of their coffee is so good.

262
00:23:17,071 --> 00:23:18,132
[SPEAKER_18]: Even if it is a month old.

263
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:18,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

264
00:23:19,072 --> 00:23:20,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, I'm sorry to interrupt.

265
00:23:20,193 --> 00:23:21,373
[SPEAKER_18]: Their coffee beans are a month old.

266
00:23:22,894 --> 00:23:23,214
[SPEAKER_18]: At least.

267
00:23:24,275 --> 00:23:34,820
[SPEAKER_18]: But no, in Mississippi it's law that if you have more than three people in the same room, at least of course one has to be of a different gender, and they're not wearing shoes, it's an orgy.

268
00:23:36,073 --> 00:23:36,994
[SPEAKER_18]: and the state of Mississippi.

269
00:23:37,354 --> 00:23:38,395
[SPEAKER_05]: You have got to be kidding.

270
00:23:38,675 --> 00:23:39,855
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not kidding you at all.

271
00:23:40,676 --> 00:23:41,416
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's see.

272
00:23:41,516 --> 00:23:42,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie doesn't have shoes on.

273
00:23:43,618 --> 00:23:44,999
[SPEAKER_05]: The Guana Girl doesn't have shoes on.

274
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,399
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have shoes on.

275
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,561
[SPEAKER_18]: Good thing we're not in Mississippi.

276
00:23:49,581 --> 00:23:51,202
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank God we're not in Mississippi.

277
00:23:51,603 --> 00:23:52,663
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry people in Mississippi.

278
00:23:53,364 --> 00:23:54,104
[SPEAKER_18]: But thank God.

279
00:23:55,665 --> 00:23:59,528
[SPEAKER_05]: With all due respect to our friends in Mississippi, thank God we're not you.

280
00:24:03,822 --> 00:24:08,085
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, I actually have room to say this because I've been in Mississippi.

281
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:09,826
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm from Alabama.

282
00:24:10,567 --> 00:24:12,328
[SPEAKER_18]: I have been in Mississippi quite a bit.

283
00:24:13,088 --> 00:24:14,409
[SPEAKER_18]: My mom works in Biloxi.

284
00:24:18,372 --> 00:24:19,132
[SPEAKER_18]: I like California.

285
00:24:20,954 --> 00:24:31,521
[SPEAKER_18]: And also, as far as the rest of my weekend day has been, it's just been, today has been kind of, yesterday was really just weird for me.

286
00:24:32,711 --> 00:24:33,872
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd have to say it ended well.

287
00:24:33,912 --> 00:24:34,753
[SPEAKER_18]: It ended very well.

288
00:24:34,993 --> 00:24:35,354
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good.

289
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:37,856
[SPEAKER_18]: But today has just been like, ugh, rain.

290
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,498
[SPEAKER_05]: I noticed you were a little drained yesterday.

291
00:24:40,538 --> 00:24:46,624
[SPEAKER_05]: We were doing the Top 10, 14 show, whatever, 10 or 14, whatever it was, over on DDR Freak Radio.

292
00:24:47,265 --> 00:24:50,688
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we were all feeling a little drained after that.

293
00:24:50,708 --> 00:24:53,971
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're just so used to doing these things on Sunday nights.

294
00:24:55,152 --> 00:24:55,773
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I had...

295
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,968
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

296
00:25:22,213 --> 00:25:27,016
[SPEAKER_18]: And they had KR3, and so I knew the only way that I'd get to hear Waiting For You was if I was the one to sing it.

297
00:25:27,076 --> 00:25:28,337
[SPEAKER_18]: So I was like, okay, well, I'll do that.

298
00:25:29,297 --> 00:25:30,818
[SPEAKER_18]: And everyone was like, oh, that song's cool.

299
00:25:30,938 --> 00:25:31,519
[SPEAKER_18]: Who did that?

300
00:25:31,939 --> 00:25:34,461
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I got to be all nerdy and say, hey, that's from Silent Hill 4.

301
00:25:34,581 --> 00:25:35,261
[SPEAKER_18]: You should play that.

302
00:25:38,143 --> 00:25:48,369
[SPEAKER_18]: But today's just been, you know... Yesterday, though, see, I was headachy and sick all New Year's night, New Year's Eve.

303
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:51,211
[SPEAKER_18]: And then yesterday morning, I was just feeling really...

304
00:25:53,228 --> 00:26:00,734
[SPEAKER_18]: Just out of it because I did something really stupid the night before after consuming two bottles of Guinness in ten minutes.

305
00:26:02,295 --> 00:26:07,379
[SPEAKER_05]: And for those of you that were listening about six months ago when we had our last drunk show, was it that long?

306
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:07,839
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was.

307
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

308
00:26:09,861 --> 00:26:13,183
[SPEAKER_18]: When I passed out in your bed and then proceeded to eat four waffles.

309
00:26:14,024 --> 00:26:18,547
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that was the same show where I was kicking at the wall going, I'm in the Matrix, I'm in the Matrix.

310
00:26:19,648 --> 00:26:21,770
[SPEAKER_18]: I will buy you some damn waffles, okay?

311
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:21,870
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

312
00:26:24,863 --> 00:26:29,906
[SPEAKER_18]: Next Saturday, I will take you for waffles.

313
00:26:31,207 --> 00:26:33,388
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, free food, yeah.

314
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:36,190
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I say this on the air.

315
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:39,231
[SPEAKER_18]: Next Saturday, or at least a Saturday in the future.

316
00:26:41,693 --> 00:26:42,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait a minute, wait a minute.

317
00:26:43,254 --> 00:26:44,114
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, next Saturday.

318
00:26:44,214 --> 00:26:45,455
[SPEAKER_18]: Next Saturday, we will go get waffles.

319
00:26:45,915 --> 00:26:46,796
[SPEAKER_05]: We're backpedaling.

320
00:26:47,376 --> 00:26:49,377
[SPEAKER_18]: No, next Saturday, we will get waffles.

321
00:26:49,397 --> 00:26:50,178
[SPEAKER_18]: Keep your schedule free.

322
00:26:50,678 --> 00:26:50,978
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

323
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:52,583
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to tag along.

324
00:26:52,603 --> 00:26:53,524
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to buy me waffles.

325
00:26:53,544 --> 00:26:55,224
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll buy my own waffle.

326
00:26:55,444 --> 00:26:56,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Challenge Breakfast.

327
00:26:56,465 --> 00:26:57,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we going to go to Country Waffles?

328
00:26:58,126 --> 00:26:58,306
Sure.

329
00:26:58,486 --> 00:27:01,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they got peanut butter banana waffles there.

330
00:27:04,688 --> 00:27:06,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Waffles blessed by Jesus.

331
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:09,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki says that for a reason.

332
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the Country Waffles place...

333
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:14,511
[SPEAKER_05]: is decorated in Jesus, basically.

334
00:27:14,651 --> 00:27:15,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you serious?

335
00:27:15,511 --> 00:27:17,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it has a Jesus theme to it.

336
00:27:17,232 --> 00:27:18,813
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you've been to places like this before.

337
00:27:18,993 --> 00:27:19,133
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

338
00:27:20,254 --> 00:27:27,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, some places have, like, you know, the jungle theme, and some places have the, you know, the element theme and the cave theme.

339
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:29,300
[SPEAKER_05]: This place has a Jesus theme.

340
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,442
[SPEAKER_18]: I was going to take you there, and then they changed management.

341
00:27:35,043 --> 00:27:35,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

342
00:27:35,644 --> 00:27:35,984
[SPEAKER_18]: But, um...

343
00:27:38,552 --> 00:27:39,853
[SPEAKER_18]: Do they have whole grain waffles?

344
00:27:40,274 --> 00:27:44,116
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, but I'm just waiting for the Virgin Mary to show up in my waffle so I can sell it on eBay.

345
00:27:45,057 --> 00:27:48,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, damn, you can make a killing on eBay.

346
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,662
[SPEAKER_06]: So you remember that guy that sold the French toast that had the Virgin Mary's likeness in it?

347
00:27:52,902 --> 00:27:53,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't it like 10 years old or something?

348
00:27:54,003 --> 00:27:58,125
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, he had saved it for 10 years and finally was like, time to move on.

349
00:27:58,146 --> 00:28:02,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, sorry to keep interrupting.

350
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:06,231
[SPEAKER_18]: That reminds me of, you remember the old Bloom County comics?

351
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:06,531
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

352
00:28:07,051 --> 00:28:07,712
[SPEAKER_18]: The first opus.

353
00:28:08,886 --> 00:28:13,408
[SPEAKER_18]: They had the one about the woman who had the image of Elvis in mold on her refrigerator.

354
00:28:14,308 --> 00:28:17,269
[SPEAKER_18]: And then later on the crowds dispersed because it turned into Mr. Ed.

355
00:28:18,689 --> 00:28:19,470
[SPEAKER_18]: The mold crew.

356
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:24,731
[SPEAKER_18]: But anyway, I'm in a much better mood now than I was.

357
00:28:25,191 --> 00:28:27,892
[SPEAKER_18]: I was in a crap mood all day.

358
00:28:28,753 --> 00:28:29,353
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm happy now.

359
00:28:30,853 --> 00:28:32,014
[SPEAKER_18]: Look at me grin.

360
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:36,395
[SPEAKER_18]: And of course the people listening will never ever see this because I fear...

361
00:28:37,185 --> 00:28:37,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Webcams.

362
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:38,105
[SPEAKER_18]: The webcam.

363
00:28:38,285 --> 00:28:39,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, fair enough.

364
00:28:40,306 --> 00:28:41,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

365
00:28:41,506 --> 00:28:41,906
[SPEAKER_18]: Done.

366
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:42,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on.

367
00:28:42,946 --> 00:28:43,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki!

368
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:45,126
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't heard a lot from you yet tonight.

369
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:45,547
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your week?

370
00:28:45,567 --> 00:28:46,027
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your day?

371
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:53,308
[SPEAKER_07]: But little does she realize, we've hidden a hidden camera up above Rob to capture her without her knowing... Oh, just a second.

372
00:28:53,668 --> 00:28:54,548
[SPEAKER_18]: You can bite me.

373
00:28:56,449 --> 00:29:01,790
[SPEAKER_18]: HotOrangeLoungeUpskirtCam.com I'm wearing jeans.

374
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:02,290
[SPEAKER_18]: Doesn't work.

375
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:03,690
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why nobody visits that site.

376
00:29:09,209 --> 00:29:09,709
[SPEAKER_07]: New Year's Eve?

377
00:29:09,769 --> 00:29:19,572
[SPEAKER_07]: We played Trivial Pursuit 90s Edition and watched South Park.

378
00:29:35,967 --> 00:29:36,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is nothing.

379
00:29:36,707 --> 00:29:37,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and Torture the Cat.

380
00:29:38,468 --> 00:29:42,569
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um... But not with a gun, right?

381
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:43,790
[SPEAKER_07]: No, with a whip.

382
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:45,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

383
00:29:46,491 --> 00:29:48,832
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um... Yeah.

384
00:29:49,432 --> 00:29:52,613
[SPEAKER_07]: That's about all I did, I think.

385
00:29:52,653 --> 00:29:53,594
[SPEAKER_07]: This week kind of sucked.

386
00:29:54,254 --> 00:29:55,774
[SPEAKER_07]: At least I didn't have to do any more potlucks.

387
00:29:56,435 --> 00:29:57,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Stupid company.

388
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:00,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's about it.

389
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I'll go later, so let's hear from some guests.

390
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:06,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's the mic getting handed over there?

391
00:30:06,739 --> 00:30:09,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Jazz, who, by the way...

392
00:30:10,046 --> 00:30:11,906
[SPEAKER_05]: won one of our Kiryamoka CDs.

393
00:30:12,086 --> 00:30:12,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

394
00:30:13,147 --> 00:30:20,428
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I remember right, one of the rules for the contest was that being here so many times rendered you ineligible, but you were like just under that?

395
00:30:20,608 --> 00:30:21,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

396
00:30:21,368 --> 00:30:22,369
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been here once before.

397
00:30:22,449 --> 00:30:23,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so now this is your second.

398
00:30:23,569 --> 00:30:24,529
[SPEAKER_05]: What was it, like three times?

399
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:30,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I was going to say, that's kind of funny if this would push you over that limit after you already won the contest, but... He, he, he.

400
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:31,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Technicalities rule.

401
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:32,051
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

402
00:30:32,691 --> 00:30:34,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't you end up giving away that CD to one of your friends?

403
00:30:34,851 --> 00:30:36,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, for Christmas I gave it to my best friend.

404
00:30:36,631 --> 00:30:37,312
[SPEAKER_03]: And what did she say?

405
00:30:37,592 --> 00:30:39,232
[SPEAKER_03]: She said, oh my God, a bunch of times.

406
00:30:40,197 --> 00:30:41,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

407
00:30:59,717 --> 00:31:01,939
[SPEAKER_03]: and every time we got teamed together we would kick ass.

408
00:31:02,199 --> 00:31:02,999
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't understand.

409
00:31:03,019 --> 00:31:04,080
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't understand.

410
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,322
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a rule about when Rob plays Mario Party.

411
00:31:06,802 --> 00:31:10,705
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to be Princess Peach or I throw a fit like a little baby, okay?

412
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:14,407
[SPEAKER_03]: So I took Daisy because Rob already took Peach and I got mad.

413
00:31:16,128 --> 00:31:20,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so after New Year's I slept for a little bit.

414
00:31:20,992 --> 00:31:26,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I woke up and then I came here for the Top 14 show and that was fun.

415
00:31:27,569 --> 00:31:31,732
[SPEAKER_03]: and then we went back to Jessica's place and we all slept.

416
00:31:32,813 --> 00:31:33,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Together?

417
00:31:33,713 --> 00:31:33,974
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

418
00:31:34,194 --> 00:31:34,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

419
00:31:38,417 --> 00:31:41,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, we played Rumble Roses a lot and that was fun.

420
00:31:41,619 --> 00:31:41,999
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

421
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,761
[SPEAKER_03]: No, don't be sorry.

422
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:44,681
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great game.

423
00:31:44,721 --> 00:31:45,842
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hilarious.

424
00:31:45,922 --> 00:31:47,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Rumble Roses is pretty funny.

425
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:49,445
[SPEAKER_03]: The story mode is just hilarious for that game.

426
00:31:51,426 --> 00:31:56,269
[SPEAKER_03]: And so today I went to RVGL for the first time in like ever.

427
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:56,710
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

428
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:58,359
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so sorry.

429
00:31:58,499 --> 00:31:59,219
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't too bad.

430
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,600
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not as bad as it was about a year ago.

431
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,261
[SPEAKER_05]: If he'd gone about a year ago, it would have been like, oh boy.

432
00:32:04,501 --> 00:32:07,482
[SPEAKER_05]: But now, it's improving.

433
00:32:08,062 --> 00:32:10,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you say hello to the new 2DX machine that has no monitor?

434
00:32:10,983 --> 00:32:11,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

435
00:32:11,363 --> 00:32:11,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

436
00:32:11,803 --> 00:32:12,323
[SPEAKER_03]: I was curious.

437
00:32:13,944 --> 00:32:14,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

438
00:32:15,825 --> 00:32:17,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, I just played Taiken 5 all day.

439
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:18,845
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was fun.

440
00:32:19,266 --> 00:32:20,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I finally have a card.

441
00:32:20,726 --> 00:32:21,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though it costs $5.

442
00:32:21,846 --> 00:32:22,467
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't care.

443
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:23,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's a good game.

444
00:32:24,047 --> 00:32:24,767
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good, damn it.

445
00:32:25,067 --> 00:32:24,767
$5?

446
00:32:25,187 --> 00:32:25,748
[SPEAKER_18]: It's $5 for a card.

447
00:32:27,366 --> 00:32:28,207
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

448
00:32:48,403 --> 00:32:51,147
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, the chick related to, uh, Jun.

449
00:32:51,627 --> 00:32:51,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Asuka?

450
00:32:52,228 --> 00:32:52,749
[SPEAKER_18]: Asuka, yeah.

451
00:32:52,769 --> 00:32:54,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Same person as you?

452
00:32:54,831 --> 00:32:57,855
[SPEAKER_18]: Just because Jin's moves are not fun anymore.

453
00:32:57,975 --> 00:33:01,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'm kind of a Tekken retard, so explain something to me.

454
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:06,104
[SPEAKER_05]: What exactly is the difference between Tekken 4 and Tekken 5, besides the card thing?

455
00:33:06,385 --> 00:33:08,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Tekken 4 was dumb and Tekken 5 isn't.

456
00:33:09,116 --> 00:33:10,497
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Tekken 4.

457
00:33:10,717 --> 00:33:12,618
[SPEAKER_18]: I like Tekken 4 a whole bunch.

458
00:33:12,718 --> 00:33:19,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Tekken 4 was basically, to me, it seemed like Tekken was trying to be like DOA and it did not work at all for me.

459
00:33:20,063 --> 00:33:24,165
[SPEAKER_03]: And Tekken 5 is a lot more like Tag, which I loved, so it worked a lot for better.

460
00:33:24,565 --> 00:33:28,748
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't care for Tag, but I do like Tekken 5 just because I was a Jin player in Tekken 2.

461
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:32,350
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's why I played Jin, because I was also a Kazuya player.

462
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:35,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's the guy without the shirt that all the girls swoon over?

463
00:33:36,206 --> 00:33:36,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Jin?

464
00:33:36,866 --> 00:33:38,027
[SPEAKER_18]: Then again, there's also Hwarang.

465
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:39,748
[SPEAKER_18]: But he was the Korean guy with the red hair.

466
00:33:39,788 --> 00:33:40,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, no, I'm not talking about Hwarang.

467
00:33:40,909 --> 00:33:41,750
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking about Jin.

468
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:42,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

469
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:43,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Is Jin in Tekken 5?

470
00:33:44,531 --> 00:33:44,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

471
00:33:45,112 --> 00:33:45,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

472
00:33:45,872 --> 00:33:46,472
[SPEAKER_13]: And he's still hot.

473
00:33:46,773 --> 00:33:47,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

474
00:33:47,533 --> 00:33:48,394
[SPEAKER_05]: That was my next question.

475
00:33:48,434 --> 00:33:48,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

476
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:51,576
[SPEAKER_13]: And that was about it.

477
00:33:53,077 --> 00:33:53,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Alrighty.

478
00:33:53,977 --> 00:33:55,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on to Islander.

479
00:33:55,598 --> 00:33:56,159
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your week?

480
00:33:56,199 --> 00:33:57,820
[SPEAKER_22]: How was your day?

481
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,860
[SPEAKER_22]: Week was actually pretty good.

482
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,361
[SPEAKER_22]: Pretty good.

483
00:34:00,001 --> 00:34:02,843
[SPEAKER_22]: Just spent all... Work was so damn slow.

484
00:34:03,585 --> 00:34:07,007
[SPEAKER_22]: I just spent my entire day trying to find stuff to do.

485
00:34:07,547 --> 00:34:10,989
[SPEAKER_22]: It was to the point where we were cutting papers just for scratch paper.

486
00:34:11,609 --> 00:34:13,070
[SPEAKER_22]: I spent about a day doing that.

487
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:14,690
[SPEAKER_22]: Just out of sheer boredom.

488
00:34:14,971 --> 00:34:15,671
[SPEAKER_22]: It was horrible.

489
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:18,538
[SPEAKER_22]: Were you making little crafts out of them, too?

490
00:34:18,558 --> 00:34:19,639
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, it's really funny.

491
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:30,501
[SPEAKER_22]: One of our roommates downloaded... He actually printed up some papers on how to make origami rhinos and left them at work.

492
00:34:31,001 --> 00:34:33,882
[SPEAKER_22]: And I was half-concerning actually making some, but didn't get around to doing it.

493
00:34:35,662 --> 00:34:36,402
[SPEAKER_22]: But, anyways.

494
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:43,884
[SPEAKER_22]: Other than that, you know, spent New Year's... You know, I didn't have as many jello shots as I should have.

495
00:34:44,636 --> 00:34:45,156
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

496
00:35:09,688 --> 00:35:11,030
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, absolutely, good stuff.

497
00:35:12,753 --> 00:35:17,200
[SPEAKER_22]: But yeah, like, you know, Jazz and I played a lot of Rumble Roses.

498
00:35:19,343 --> 00:35:21,507
[SPEAKER_22]: He played Tekken 5, I played DLC, like I always do.

499
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,530
[SPEAKER_22]: because DLC is my crack.

500
00:35:24,711 --> 00:35:30,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it just me, or is there now starting to become like a little Roseville Golf Land following for Derby Owners Club?

501
00:35:30,252 --> 00:35:31,072
[SPEAKER_22]: No, there is, there is.

502
00:35:31,452 --> 00:35:33,293
[SPEAKER_22]: I was actually playing, and there was this one guy.

503
00:35:33,473 --> 00:35:34,593
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are people I've never seen before.

504
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,534
[SPEAKER_22]: There was one guy who was playing, and he had some pretty good horses.

505
00:35:38,314 --> 00:35:42,315
[SPEAKER_22]: And whenever he saw mine pop up, he was, I could always hear a sigh from the back.

506
00:35:42,335 --> 00:35:43,875
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like, ah, damn, I'm going to be in for it.

507
00:35:44,695 --> 00:35:45,896
[SPEAKER_22]: And I could not beat this fucker.

508
00:35:47,176 --> 00:35:47,736
[SPEAKER_22]: I could not beat him.

509
00:35:48,556 --> 00:35:51,257
[SPEAKER_22]: When we finally left, he actually turned around and said, hey, man, you're pretty good, and

510
00:35:51,772 --> 00:35:54,073
[SPEAKER_22]: I was like, wow, okay, interesting.

511
00:35:54,213 --> 00:35:57,575
[SPEAKER_22]: But yeah, there is a little following there, and I hope it really takes off.

512
00:35:57,855 --> 00:36:03,098
[SPEAKER_05]: In the beginning, though, if I remember right, half the following was just Milpitas people driving up to see their machine.

513
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:08,461
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, and the people calling in saying, hey, we want our machine back.

514
00:36:09,784 --> 00:36:11,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, whatever happened with that?

515
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:12,485
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, though?

516
00:36:12,665 --> 00:36:13,525
[SPEAKER_05]: That does kind of suck.

517
00:36:13,745 --> 00:36:17,646
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're in that area, in Milpitas area, and to have a machine like that.

518
00:36:17,866 --> 00:36:18,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's true, that's true.

519
00:36:18,826 --> 00:36:19,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Poop, poop, poop.

520
00:36:19,906 --> 00:36:20,726
[SPEAKER_06]: True, true, true.

521
00:36:22,147 --> 00:36:23,127
[SPEAKER_22]: They can pay twice as much money.

522
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:25,668
[SPEAKER_22]: I did that for a long time.

523
00:36:25,968 --> 00:36:26,248
[SPEAKER_22]: Blah.

524
00:36:28,028 --> 00:36:28,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, okay, then.

525
00:36:31,069 --> 00:36:31,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, yes?

526
00:36:32,469 --> 00:36:36,390
[SPEAKER_03]: About RVGL, though, there was one very odd thing that I saw.

527
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:43,053
[SPEAKER_03]: I was playing Drum Mania, sucking like usual because I don't play Drum Mania, and there's this guy next to me.

528
00:36:43,694 --> 00:36:47,996
[SPEAKER_03]: It was obvious to me that he's kind of mentally handicapped in some way.

529
00:36:48,277 --> 00:36:48,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

530
00:36:49,417 --> 00:36:54,580
[SPEAKER_03]: But then he went up to the Guitar Freak's screen and either licked it or sniffed it.

531
00:36:55,801 --> 00:36:58,823
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just mortified beyond all belief.

532
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:01,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe he didn't understand how to play the game.

533
00:37:01,865 --> 00:37:04,206
[SPEAKER_03]: He was like sniffing Tran or something.

534
00:37:04,246 --> 00:37:05,867
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, what the hell is going on?

535
00:37:06,647 --> 00:37:09,009
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, that was a little scary, so I ran away.

536
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,711
[SPEAKER_06]: I can smell your cunt from here.

537
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:15,033
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh no, you didn't.

538
00:37:15,053 --> 00:37:21,518
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a film reference.

539
00:37:21,538 --> 00:37:22,439
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob is red.

540
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:23,179
[SPEAKER_18]: This is funny.

541
00:37:24,921 --> 00:37:28,203
[SPEAKER_06]: I think what made that so funny is because that was really out of nowhere.

542
00:37:28,623 --> 00:37:33,287
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, just... Not only was it out of nowhere, but it was so obscure...

543
00:37:34,488 --> 00:37:36,189
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

544
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:10,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, that's what we're here to do, to fulfill your naughty words quotient of the week.

545
00:38:10,919 --> 00:38:14,161
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what I get for missing Rocky all this time.

546
00:38:15,161 --> 00:38:16,121
[SPEAKER_20]: I have to get it someplace.

547
00:38:17,902 --> 00:38:21,663
[SPEAKER_20]: Week was relatively calm.

548
00:38:22,824 --> 00:38:28,746
[SPEAKER_20]: Like Jamie was saying, we did the whole big, massive shopping trip on Sunday, which was pretty cool because...

549
00:38:29,924 --> 00:38:33,768
[SPEAKER_20]: I have really, really, really, really, really needed new clothing.

550
00:38:35,509 --> 00:38:44,057
[SPEAKER_20]: I've been shrinking out of everything that I own and it's very difficult to find new clothes that are at a decent price for big people.

551
00:38:44,577 --> 00:38:46,519
[SPEAKER_05]: But best new reason to buy new clothes, though.

552
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:47,780
[SPEAKER_20]: Exactly, exactly.

553
00:38:48,261 --> 00:38:53,205
[SPEAKER_20]: So I took my $200 and got a bunch of new bras and all that.

554
00:38:53,285 --> 00:38:54,186
[SPEAKER_00]: La, la, la, la, la.

555
00:38:55,888 --> 00:38:57,969
[SPEAKER_20]: Hey, those suckers cost a lot, buddy.

556
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:01,049
[SPEAKER_20]: I paid $52 for four bras, and that was on sale.

557
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:03,290
[SPEAKER_05]: See, you know what?

558
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:06,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Walmart, $5 for a three-pack undies.

559
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:09,691
[SPEAKER_20]: It's hard to find... Okay, let me put it this way.

560
00:39:10,432 --> 00:39:15,393
[SPEAKER_20]: It's hard to find bras this big for cheap prices.

561
00:39:15,693 --> 00:39:16,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, alright.

562
00:39:17,153 --> 00:39:19,674
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like, you know, it truly is an over-the-shoulder bra-ble-harter.

563
00:39:19,714 --> 00:39:20,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you hear that, boys?

564
00:39:20,814 --> 00:39:21,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Big bras.

565
00:39:21,854 --> 00:39:22,654
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what that means?

566
00:39:22,674 --> 00:39:23,255
[SPEAKER_20]: I need this reference!

567
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:31,852
[SPEAKER_20]: But we ended up going over to Old Navy and found my jackpot.

568
00:39:31,912 --> 00:39:42,137
[SPEAKER_20]: I managed to get four shirts and two pairs of pants for $100, and I was all super happy because I told myself I wouldn't get anything over a certain size, and I didn't, so yay!

569
00:39:43,937 --> 00:39:45,358
[SPEAKER_20]: But that's about it.

570
00:39:46,498 --> 00:39:47,399
[SPEAKER_20]: My week was pretty boring.

571
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,240
[SPEAKER_20]: I fell asleep a lot.

572
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,441
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what the holidays are for, though.

573
00:39:52,561 --> 00:39:52,801
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

574
00:39:54,249 --> 00:39:55,131
[SPEAKER_20]: I was really tired.

575
00:39:55,472 --> 00:39:56,754
[SPEAKER_20]: And I pulled a butt muscle.

576
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:00,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Now how did you pull a butt muscle?

577
00:40:00,501 --> 00:40:07,205
[SPEAKER_20]: I was at the gym on Friday doing my FitTrack appointment with Jamie's and my mutual trainer.

578
00:40:07,985 --> 00:40:15,689
[SPEAKER_20]: And I was doing some sort of chest press, and as I stood up to move to another machine, my butt muscle just went, tweak!

579
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,811
[SPEAKER_20]: And suddenly my butt muscle hurt like hell.

580
00:40:19,451 --> 00:40:22,653
[SPEAKER_20]: So my butt muscles hurt ever since, kind of on and off.

581
00:40:23,634 --> 00:40:24,294
[SPEAKER_20]: My butt sores.

582
00:40:26,266 --> 00:40:28,027
[SPEAKER_20]: I think I need one of those little butt pillows.

583
00:40:29,987 --> 00:40:31,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Something you can strap to your bottom.

584
00:40:32,548 --> 00:40:34,029
[SPEAKER_11]: Something like that.

585
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:41,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my gosh, I'm so glad like half our studio isn't wired up right now.

586
00:40:41,951 --> 00:40:42,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

587
00:40:42,612 --> 00:40:45,153
[SPEAKER_20]: But that's about it.

588
00:40:45,313 --> 00:40:45,993
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, alright.

589
00:40:46,273 --> 00:40:47,974
[SPEAKER_20]: I won't torture you with more butt muscle stuff.

590
00:40:48,454 --> 00:40:48,914
[SPEAKER_05]: That's alright.

591
00:40:49,354 --> 00:40:50,154
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what they tune in for.

592
00:40:50,174 --> 00:40:51,295
[SPEAKER_20]: And my socks are in the dryer.

593
00:40:53,655 --> 00:40:55,096
[SPEAKER_20]: Because my feet were wet.

594
00:40:56,017 --> 00:41:00,919
[SPEAKER_05]: This show, honestly, it's about Bomani and it's about Iguana Girls, but that's it.

595
00:41:01,899 --> 00:41:04,540
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh yeah, and I did that show yesterday.

596
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, the show.

597
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,100
[SPEAKER_05]: The show was good.

598
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,801
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll talk about the show a little bit.

599
00:41:08,741 --> 00:41:13,742
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want to recap the whole show because I assume that it's going to be played again later.

600
00:41:14,223 --> 00:41:15,883
[SPEAKER_05]: But we'll talk about the show.

601
00:41:16,643 --> 00:41:18,304
[SPEAKER_20]: I already made my AIDS joke for the week.

602
00:41:20,485 --> 00:41:21,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Angel, how was your week?

603
00:41:21,505 --> 00:41:22,005
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your day?

604
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:23,777
[SPEAKER_19]: Pretty good.

605
00:41:23,797 --> 00:41:28,499
[SPEAKER_19]: I spent the holidays up in the bay with my folks.

606
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:37,022
[SPEAKER_19]: And it was pretty good except for the fact that I had internet on Tuesday, the day that I arrived there.

607
00:41:37,222 --> 00:41:41,384
[SPEAKER_19]: By Wednesday, I didn't have internet until Christmas Day.

608
00:41:42,264 --> 00:41:46,606
[SPEAKER_19]: Which didn't really matter anyway because I ended up being sick from...

609
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:55,223
[SPEAKER_19]: Christmas Day till the Tuesday that I had, or not the Tuesday I had to leave, but, you know, the last day I was supposed to be at my folks.

610
00:41:55,523 --> 00:42:00,805
[SPEAKER_19]: So, that kind of sucked, because I didn't have internet, and then I got sick.

611
00:42:01,106 --> 00:42:12,351
[SPEAKER_19]: And then, yeah, it was basically like a stress panic type deal, because it was like the first time I had been back to my parents' house since I moved out.

612
00:42:12,491 --> 00:42:16,313
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I don't know why it happened, but I guess stress is kind of...

613
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:21,402
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, known to do that, I guess, and that.

614
00:42:21,582 --> 00:42:26,084
[SPEAKER_19]: But Christmas was good, got some DVDs I wanted, and all that.

615
00:42:27,325 --> 00:42:28,445
[SPEAKER_19]: So I was happy about that.

616
00:42:30,486 --> 00:42:46,393
[SPEAKER_19]: And New Year's was spent just, or New Year's Eve rather, was spent just watching the TV until the fireworks went off, and then the news station was kind of cool because we had, you know, four sets of fireworks going off at the same time, so that was pretty interesting to watch.

617
00:42:46,809 --> 00:42:48,530
[SPEAKER_19]: And then I had a Bloody Mary for the first time.

618
00:42:49,291 --> 00:42:50,151
[SPEAKER_19]: Yay!

619
00:42:50,432 --> 00:42:51,813
[SPEAKER_19]: Angel drank, oh my god!

620
00:42:53,254 --> 00:42:59,238
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, no, I cheated, because I only had a third of that, and then, like, a third of a glass of champagne, and then I was just like, done.

621
00:42:59,918 --> 00:43:01,259
[SPEAKER_19]: And I still don't like champagne.

622
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,041
[SPEAKER_19]: So, there's that.

623
00:43:03,741 --> 00:43:09,485
[SPEAKER_19]: And then, I've been bad, because I've been on a certain game for the past... Let's see, wait.

624
00:43:10,326 --> 00:43:13,008
[SPEAKER_19]: Probably since... Wednesday...

625
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:15,320
[SPEAKER_19]: Not as bad as the other two in here.

626
00:43:25,104 --> 00:43:36,809
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I've been playing that just a little too much, but it's okay, because it took me four months to get to that point, so you know what, just yay, alright?

627
00:43:37,369 --> 00:43:37,849
[SPEAKER_19]: That's it.

628
00:43:40,205 --> 00:43:43,047
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd just like to point out for the record that I have not been quite the addict.

629
00:43:43,767 --> 00:43:53,232
[SPEAKER_05]: I did sign on to Final Fantasy XI for a little bit this morning, and I got a message from DDR Angel, and suddenly I noticed that, like, dang, that girl's gained six levels since yesterday.

630
00:43:53,272 --> 00:43:54,593
[SPEAKER_05]: How much has she been playing?

631
00:43:56,394 --> 00:43:58,875
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, lots of PL, that's all I have to say.

632
00:43:59,576 --> 00:44:00,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyway.

633
00:44:01,078 --> 00:44:05,261
[SPEAKER_05]: So my week and my day, yeah, okay, a little bit of Final Fantasy XI, but not too bad.

634
00:44:05,742 --> 00:44:07,002
[SPEAKER_05]: I did go out and do some stuff.

635
00:44:07,523 --> 00:44:17,030
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to Iguana Girls New Year's Eve, bashed a little gathering of people there, and I learned how to play Texas Hold'em by watching Celebrity Poker, which I hadn't done before.

636
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:18,951
[SPEAKER_05]: But I love Kathy Griffin.

637
00:44:18,991 --> 00:44:20,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God, I love her.

638
00:44:20,352 --> 00:44:23,455
[SPEAKER_05]: And even though she annoys the hell out of most people, I think she's so funny.

639
00:44:23,475 --> 00:44:27,177
[SPEAKER_05]: And she was on the show, and she was the first person booted out that particular episode.

640
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:27,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry to ruin it for you.

641
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:33,015
[SPEAKER_05]: She was the first person booted out that particular episode, but it was a good watch, and I learned how to play Texas Hold'em.

642
00:44:33,055 --> 00:44:36,178
[SPEAKER_05]: So, next time you guys have a poker night, it's on.

643
00:44:36,858 --> 00:44:37,099
[SPEAKER_05]: It's on.

644
00:44:39,764 --> 00:44:45,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, outside of that, New Year's Day, one of my buddies had his birthday.

645
00:44:45,728 --> 00:44:48,990
[SPEAKER_05]: And he lives out in the middle of nowhere, California, basically.

646
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:50,711
[SPEAKER_05]: He lives about an hour's drive from here.

647
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:55,194
[SPEAKER_05]: And once you get about an hour out of Sacramento, this is why they call it Cowtown, okay?

648
00:44:55,634 --> 00:44:58,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless you're going the hour towards the bay, that's about it.

649
00:44:59,336 --> 00:45:02,558
[SPEAKER_05]: The other hours all around it is nothingness.

650
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:06,241
[SPEAKER_05]: It looked like the town out of Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, kind of.

651
00:45:08,214 --> 00:45:09,154
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

652
00:45:32,435 --> 00:45:35,998
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be able to pass Katas back to back again without having to stop.

653
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:43,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is how it's been lately, so we'll see what happens.

654
00:45:44,043 --> 00:45:45,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Other than that, that's pretty much it.

655
00:45:45,604 --> 00:45:48,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a whole lot else for me to report that I can think of off the top of my head.

656
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:49,367
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so.

657
00:45:49,867 --> 00:45:51,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe later, so we go through the rest of the show.

658
00:45:52,429 --> 00:45:55,311
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, we're going to go to a break here.

659
00:45:55,952 --> 00:46:00,115
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we come back from the break, we're going to talk about...

660
00:46:02,082 --> 00:46:03,402
[SPEAKER_05]: and some New Year's news.

661
00:46:04,103 --> 00:46:09,565
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to talk about that other new music game that I finally got to take a look at today, even though it's been out for like three months.

662
00:46:09,926 --> 00:46:10,846
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll talk about that a little bit.

663
00:46:11,346 --> 00:46:14,428
[SPEAKER_05]: And that'll be it when we come back.

664
00:46:15,688 --> 00:46:17,870
[SPEAKER_05]: This break we're going to have some music.

665
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:20,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Some things that Jamie was saying there kind of inspired me a little bit.

666
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:24,613
[SPEAKER_05]: So I thought we could do a break of music that makes Jamie angry.

667
00:46:25,193 --> 00:46:26,014
[SPEAKER_18]: That makes me angry?

668
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:26,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

669
00:46:27,014 --> 00:46:28,175
[SPEAKER_18]: Was it all solitary?

670
00:46:28,395 --> 00:46:28,595
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

671
00:46:29,415 --> 00:46:30,496
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's going to be the safari.

672
00:46:31,089 --> 00:46:31,670
[SPEAKER_05]: to start it off.

673
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:32,431
[SPEAKER_18]: I like the song.

674
00:46:32,491 --> 00:46:34,494
[SPEAKER_18]: As long as you don't play the fast, crappy one.

675
00:46:34,555 --> 00:46:37,279
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually like the song, but it pisses me off to play.

676
00:46:37,379 --> 00:46:37,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

677
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,703
[SPEAKER_05]: These are going to be songs that piss Jamie off to play.

678
00:46:39,723 --> 00:46:42,167
[SPEAKER_18]: Although I did manage to stay about a 50% on it.

679
00:46:42,287 --> 00:46:43,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, there you go.

680
00:46:43,789 --> 00:46:44,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, here we go.

681
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:45,312
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back after this.

682
00:47:06,597 --> 00:47:07,418
Thanks for watching!

683
00:48:45,178 --> 00:48:46,160
Thanks for watching!

684
00:49:26,776 --> 00:49:27,538
Thanks for watching!

685
00:50:02,575 --> 00:50:03,536
Thanks for watching!

686
00:51:11,085 --> 00:51:12,029
Thanks for watching!

687
00:52:07,068 --> 00:52:08,668
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.

688
00:52:09,028 --> 00:52:14,750
[SPEAKER_14]: And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.

689
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:20,751
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

690
00:52:21,091 --> 00:52:22,971
[SPEAKER_13]: It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

691
00:52:23,551 --> 00:52:27,972
[SPEAKER_13]: Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

692
00:52:28,732 --> 00:52:33,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, our old buddy Mel there.

693
00:52:33,513 --> 00:52:34,614
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know when he's coming back to the show.

694
00:52:34,634 --> 00:52:36,034
[SPEAKER_18]: That was one of our very early shows.

695
00:52:36,374 --> 00:52:36,614
[SPEAKER_18]: That...

696
00:52:37,308 --> 00:52:44,934
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe Mel came out for episode 6, which was a long time ago.

697
00:52:46,575 --> 00:52:48,076
[SPEAKER_18]: Back when I was still using the headset.

698
00:52:48,777 --> 00:52:49,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh gosh, oh yes.

699
00:52:50,018 --> 00:52:52,500
[SPEAKER_18]: That I acquired from... Memories.

700
00:52:55,622 --> 00:52:58,864
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to have an official nostalgia segment of the show, I think, because it comes up every week.

701
00:52:58,924 --> 00:53:00,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember back when Orange Lounge was cool?

702
00:53:01,666 --> 00:53:02,727
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, we're always cool.

703
00:53:02,747 --> 00:53:04,268
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I'm just playing around.

704
00:53:05,769 --> 00:53:05,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

705
00:53:07,153 --> 00:53:08,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, what's going on this week?

706
00:53:08,553 --> 00:53:15,996
[SPEAKER_05]: We had the big show we were doing here yesterday over on that other radio station, DDR Freak Radio.

707
00:53:18,057 --> 00:53:18,997
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fun, it was a good time.

708
00:53:19,057 --> 00:53:24,059
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always fun to partner up with another station, kind of put your resources together to do something fun.

709
00:53:24,719 --> 00:53:29,600
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty cool to be a part of the first live show that DDR Freak had really done.

710
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it the first live show?

711
00:53:32,608 --> 00:53:40,912
[SPEAKER_20]: There was a very, very brief, like, 15-minute thing that I did that was just me being incredibly bored and experimental.

712
00:53:41,132 --> 00:53:41,412
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

713
00:53:41,572 --> 00:53:41,892
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

714
00:53:42,172 --> 00:53:48,555
[SPEAKER_20]: And I did, you know, the whole radio DJ bit for a whopping... You're listening to DDR music!

715
00:53:48,615 --> 00:53:49,295
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the top of the hour.

716
00:53:49,875 --> 00:53:50,436
[SPEAKER_20]: Exactly.

717
00:53:51,076 --> 00:53:51,356
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

718
00:53:51,396 --> 00:53:51,836
[SPEAKER_20]: Exactly.

719
00:53:52,296 --> 00:53:57,719
[SPEAKER_20]: So I consider yesterday being the first DDR Freak Live special.

720
00:53:57,759 --> 00:53:58,179
[SPEAKER_20]: The first...

721
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:00,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Horde Show, basically.

722
00:54:00,321 --> 00:54:02,943
[SPEAKER_05]: The one you've got to whore out to the masses to get people to tune in.

723
00:54:03,563 --> 00:54:07,245
[SPEAKER_20]: Because, you know, I've done all of the other crap with the history of DDR.

724
00:54:08,026 --> 00:54:12,248
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, it's cool and all, but I want interaction.

725
00:54:12,268 --> 00:54:15,850
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to be able to get the people involved.

726
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:18,932
[SPEAKER_20]: Whenever we get the people involved, that's when we get the numbers.

727
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:20,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely, absolutely.

728
00:54:21,254 --> 00:54:23,995
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was going on and a very interesting list.

729
00:54:24,035 --> 00:54:25,375
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a top 14.

730
00:54:25,415 --> 00:54:26,815
[SPEAKER_05]: It was originally going to be a top 10.

731
00:54:27,015 --> 00:54:30,076
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, because not enough people got their butts out there and voted.

732
00:54:30,096 --> 00:54:37,318
[SPEAKER_05]: To their credit though, it was only a day, but still more people could have done their part.

733
00:54:37,398 --> 00:54:38,298
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's alright, it happens.

734
00:54:38,998 --> 00:54:41,119
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the holidays, I guess.

735
00:54:42,639 --> 00:54:46,500
[SPEAKER_05]: So it ended up, because of all the ties, there was a top 14 list they came up with.

736
00:54:47,836 --> 00:54:48,677
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want to ruin it.

737
00:54:48,717 --> 00:54:52,401
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of you guys probably already figured it out for yourselves, maybe, if you know how to do that.

738
00:54:53,302 --> 00:54:55,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Or some of you guys may have tuned in.

739
00:54:55,784 --> 00:55:00,228
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are going to be replays coming up soon, and those will be announced over on DDR Freak Radio.

740
00:55:00,909 --> 00:55:06,094
[SPEAKER_05]: For you dial-up users, because I don't think it's going to show up on DDR Freak low-band, right?

741
00:55:06,535 --> 00:55:07,376
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

742
00:55:07,396 --> 00:55:11,119
[SPEAKER_20]: Low-band is pretty much dying out, and it will probably be disbanded after...

743
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:12,987
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura.com

744
00:55:23,652 --> 00:55:25,033
[SPEAKER_05]: We can say a pretty good quality.

745
00:55:25,053 --> 00:55:31,376
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, if you guys don't know what MP3 Pro is, and we're not sounding like FM quality to you, then you're missing the MP3 Pro codec.

746
00:55:31,516 --> 00:55:39,600
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you want to just get more information on that, go to www.orangeonsradio.com and click on the FAQ, and that'll give you all the information on the MP3 Pro codec.

747
00:55:39,921 --> 00:55:45,323
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're listening to us in your iTunes player right now, iTunes does not have MP3 Pro codec.

748
00:55:45,443 --> 00:55:48,405
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's actually a much clearer version of the stream available.

749
00:55:48,785 --> 00:55:49,826
[SPEAKER_05]: All the information is over there.

750
00:55:49,986 --> 00:55:50,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Check it out.

751
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:51,100
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

752
00:56:01,312 --> 00:56:16,655
[SPEAKER_05]: and I want to say that the DDR Freak Top 10 Countdown we will broadcast for our dial-up users and for those that want to catch it one time and that's Tuesday night as part of Pump Up the Volume.

753
00:56:17,295 --> 00:56:20,596
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to tune in to Jamie's show because she'll play the Top 10 show as part of her show.

754
00:56:20,756 --> 00:56:21,856
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you don't, I'll kick your butt.

755
00:56:22,056 --> 00:56:23,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

756
00:56:23,397 --> 00:56:24,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Same rule as always.

757
00:56:24,177 --> 00:56:25,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Tune in or she'll kick your butt.

758
00:56:28,749 --> 00:56:31,871
[SPEAKER_05]: So, what did you think of the list that ended up, though?

759
00:56:31,911 --> 00:56:33,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Were you kind of surprised with it?

760
00:56:34,413 --> 00:56:37,415
[SPEAKER_20]: It was... I'm not incredibly surprised.

761
00:56:37,675 --> 00:56:42,438
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm surprised at how many songs from how many different mixes got in there.

762
00:56:43,299 --> 00:56:45,520
[SPEAKER_20]: Which, you know, pleasant surprise on that front.

763
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,122
[SPEAKER_20]: But I'm really going to fucking kill Dawn.

764
00:56:48,983 --> 00:56:49,783
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm killing Frequency.

765
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,044
[SPEAKER_20]: That's all there is to it.

766
00:56:51,985 --> 00:56:55,107
[SPEAKER_20]: Dynamite Rave should not have been in that list at all.

767
00:56:55,771 --> 00:56:56,712
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you very much.

768
00:56:57,993 --> 00:57:01,035
[SPEAKER_22]: And let alone people voting for Dynamite Rave.

769
00:57:01,255 --> 00:57:01,756
[SPEAKER_22]: Good God.

770
00:57:03,417 --> 00:57:06,339
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true, because not only did it have to get nominated, but it had to get voted on.

771
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:08,521
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're not stupid.

772
00:57:08,561 --> 00:57:13,445
[SPEAKER_05]: We know that folks have their little cliques out there, because, you know, hell, I had my friends voting for Skulk.

773
00:57:13,465 --> 00:57:17,268
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, but there were other people voting for Skulk, too.

774
00:57:17,508 --> 00:57:18,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know, I know.

775
00:57:18,489 --> 00:57:19,570
[SPEAKER_20]: That's why it made it in there, but.

776
00:57:21,297 --> 00:57:27,601
[SPEAKER_20]: But, you know, overall, I was pretty pleased to see some of the stuff that ended up on the list.

777
00:57:27,721 --> 00:57:29,281
[SPEAKER_20]: And, you know, I'm glad.

778
00:57:29,762 --> 00:57:32,123
[SPEAKER_20]: I was very happy to see a lot of 2DX representation.

779
00:57:32,143 --> 00:57:33,504
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of 2DX representation.

780
00:57:33,644 --> 00:57:40,067
[SPEAKER_05]: My biggest surprise was the fact that I think on the whole list there was only two songs that were actually new in 2004.

781
00:57:40,107 --> 00:57:40,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

782
00:57:40,768 --> 00:57:41,648
[SPEAKER_05]: I think.

783
00:57:41,788 --> 00:57:42,329
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

784
00:57:42,449 --> 00:57:43,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Off the top of my head.

785
00:57:43,609 --> 00:57:45,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe there's another couple.

786
00:57:45,831 --> 00:57:46,991
[SPEAKER_20]: Not enough love for the U.S.

787
00:57:47,051 --> 00:57:47,832
[SPEAKER_20]: original stuff.

788
00:57:47,892 --> 00:57:49,973
[SPEAKER_05]: No, and that kind of surprised me because I thought...

789
00:57:50,573 --> 00:57:55,099
[SPEAKER_05]: I realize that some people have issues with the US mixes and the way that they've been presented.

790
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:00,425
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, Extreme, people bitch about the interface, although... They don't bitch about everything.

791
00:58:00,465 --> 00:58:05,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, they bitch about everything, but the biggest bitch being the interface, although, you know, it's not that bad.

792
00:58:06,767 --> 00:58:09,729
[SPEAKER_05]: But, most people are okay with the songs.

793
00:58:10,309 --> 00:58:13,191
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I hear a few bitches here and they're like, eh, why is YMCA on there?

794
00:58:13,211 --> 00:58:13,872
[SPEAKER_05]: That song's gay.

795
00:58:14,732 --> 00:58:18,455
[SPEAKER_05]: But, usually, people seem to enjoy the US exclusive songs, especially Max 2.

796
00:58:18,935 --> 00:58:20,836
[SPEAKER_05]: I think nobody can really complain about Max 2.

797
00:58:20,896 --> 00:58:21,957
[SPEAKER_20]: It was great music.

798
00:58:22,017 --> 00:58:24,018
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, it was.

799
00:58:24,899 --> 00:58:28,501
[SPEAKER_20]: All of the Max 2 stuff, even some of the Max stuff, it was just great.

800
00:58:29,342 --> 00:58:31,784
[SPEAKER_20]: But, oh well.

801
00:58:33,084 --> 00:58:33,905
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, don't go there.

802
00:58:35,946 --> 00:58:36,507
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkBlackForest.com

803
00:59:04,386 --> 00:59:05,106
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's funny?

804
00:59:05,146 --> 00:59:07,547
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that was a running gag on this show for a while, too.

805
00:59:07,567 --> 00:59:09,828
[SPEAKER_18]: It was, thanks to Darkstown.

806
00:59:09,848 --> 00:59:10,548
[SPEAKER_05]: That was Darkstown.

807
00:59:10,728 --> 00:59:11,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on, hold on.

808
00:59:11,769 --> 00:59:15,210
[SPEAKER_05]: For those who don't know what the Heleguana girl's talking about, here is a little clip, okay?

809
00:59:15,230 --> 00:59:21,532
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a long way to go, honey.

810
00:59:22,632 --> 00:59:22,892
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

811
00:59:23,993 --> 00:59:24,813
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm afraid.

812
00:59:24,853 --> 00:59:26,153
[SPEAKER_11]: Where are we going?

813
00:59:26,273 --> 00:59:27,974
[SPEAKER_11]: Into the dark.

814
00:59:28,054 --> 00:59:28,594
[SPEAKER_11]: Big.

815
00:59:28,874 --> 00:59:29,414
[SPEAKER_21]: Black.

816
00:59:29,875 --> 00:59:31,335
[SPEAKER_21]: Far.

817
00:59:33,276 --> 00:59:33,976
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, you need to get...

818
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:37,047
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

819
00:59:37,687 --> 00:59:38,527
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe it's just me.

820
00:59:39,567 --> 00:59:40,288
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm afraid.

821
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:40,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Where are we going?

822
00:59:41,088 --> 00:59:42,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up and take your clothes off, bitch.

823
00:59:46,229 --> 00:59:47,670
[SPEAKER_06]: I paid you cash up front.

824
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:48,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Now take it off.

825
00:59:53,012 --> 00:59:58,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Well... And Dark Black Forest could be a euphemism for something if you think about it.

826
00:59:59,133 --> 00:59:59,714
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what?

827
00:59:59,734 --> 01:00:00,934
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't need to go there.

828
01:00:00,954 --> 01:00:03,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone who isn't very well kept...

829
01:00:05,427 --> 01:00:06,828
[SPEAKER_18]: We've had the C-bomb once.

830
01:00:10,251 --> 01:00:12,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Both boys and girls can have this issue, okay?

831
01:00:14,394 --> 01:00:15,676
[SPEAKER_21]: Shaved ears, please.

832
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:21,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, wow.

833
01:00:22,101 --> 01:00:23,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Leave it to this show to go straight to the toilet.

834
01:00:23,442 --> 01:00:25,244
[SPEAKER_20]: Thankfully that song was not on the countdown.

835
01:00:26,625 --> 01:00:30,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because heaven forbid that subject came up yesterday.

836
01:00:33,197 --> 01:00:53,067
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I guess I have to, this would be a good time to ask this question, because, you know, DDR Freak, although I don't like to just sit here and talk about DDR Freak, let's face it though, hon, it's a big part of the community, and anybody that listens to this show knows what DDR Freak is.

837
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:54,087
[SPEAKER_05]: They may not post everything.

838
01:00:55,248 --> 01:00:55,408
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

839
01:00:56,161 --> 01:00:58,622
[SPEAKER_05]: DDR Freak is kind of family friendly, right?

840
01:00:58,642 --> 01:01:02,043
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of people get frustrated because they can't type shit and fuck.

841
01:01:02,283 --> 01:01:03,203
[SPEAKER_05]: It gets censored.

842
01:01:03,484 --> 01:01:05,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Although some of the censored stuff is really funny.

843
01:01:05,744 --> 01:01:07,005
[SPEAKER_20]: I personally like doggy.

844
01:01:07,405 --> 01:01:08,745
[SPEAKER_20]: That's just me.

845
01:01:08,785 --> 01:01:09,466
[SPEAKER_20]: I like poopy.

846
01:01:09,546 --> 01:01:10,326
[SPEAKER_05]: I like cigarette.

847
01:01:10,846 --> 01:01:16,868
[SPEAKER_22]: No, the best was before when they first tried to start it, ass turned into butt.

848
01:01:17,268 --> 01:01:21,850
[SPEAKER_22]: So someone would try to type Massachusetts and type M-A-S-S and it turned into M-butt.

849
01:01:29,355 --> 01:01:30,116
[SPEAKER_20]: Now it's just buttocks.

850
01:01:31,957 --> 01:01:33,538
[SPEAKER_05]: And buttocks choosets?

851
01:01:33,818 --> 01:01:34,098
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

852
01:01:34,158 --> 01:01:40,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, so is there a lot of youngins on DDR Freak, or do you just want to keep a G rating?

853
01:01:41,082 --> 01:01:44,905
[SPEAKER_20]: We're trying to keep it as G rated as possible just for...

854
01:01:46,197 --> 01:01:47,038
[SPEAKER_20]: The overall audience.

855
01:01:47,238 --> 01:01:52,321
[SPEAKER_20]: We get quite a few mentions on all of the different mixes that are coming out.

856
01:01:52,841 --> 01:01:56,704
[SPEAKER_20]: And one of the first places that people are going to go when they look up DDR is going to be DDR Freaks.

857
01:01:56,764 --> 01:02:08,991
[SPEAKER_20]: So we have to kind of try to keep that family-friendly vibe going so that somebody's 13-year-old kid isn't going to be coming on there and their parents are going, Oh my God, is that the word fuck on your screen?

858
01:02:09,511 --> 01:02:10,892
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, freaking out or something.

859
01:02:12,176 --> 01:02:20,238
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, obviously, there's ways around the filters, and if you're smart enough, you can kind of... Just ask any of the ops in our chat room.

860
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:20,898
[SPEAKER_05]: They know how to do it.

861
01:02:21,159 --> 01:02:23,539
[SPEAKER_20]: Or just quote somebody's post, and you'll be able to see it.

862
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:26,260
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, wait, I gave away a secret.

863
01:02:29,101 --> 01:02:33,242
[SPEAKER_20]: But, yeah, we don't really... We don't really...

864
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:44,673
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel kind of bad because I dropped the F-bomb on yesterday's show.

865
01:02:44,933 --> 01:02:48,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of forgetting that whole family-friendly vibe.

866
01:02:48,795 --> 01:02:50,695
[SPEAKER_05]: At least I didn't say what Loki said earlier.

867
01:02:53,517 --> 01:02:54,837
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not too concerned about it.

868
01:02:55,237 --> 01:02:57,158
[SPEAKER_20]: It's no big deal.

869
01:02:57,498 --> 01:02:59,979
[SPEAKER_20]: I was the one sitting there making AIDS jokes.

870
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:03,281
[SPEAKER_20]: If there's nothing less family-friendly...

871
01:03:04,068 --> 01:03:06,710
[SPEAKER_20]: Or politically correct, really.

872
01:03:10,173 --> 01:03:13,436
[SPEAKER_05]: I just had to ask about the family thing.

873
01:03:15,658 --> 01:03:17,760
[SPEAKER_20]: Here's the catch-22 that we have.

874
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:25,426
[SPEAKER_20]: We have specifically, when you sign up for the site, when you sign up for the forums, it asks you, it says, I am over the age of 13.

875
01:03:26,907 --> 01:03:31,311
[SPEAKER_20]: And you cannot agree to that unless you're over the age of 13 or you're lying.

876
01:03:32,489 --> 01:03:35,791
[SPEAKER_20]: So, unfortunately, we do have, you know, 11-year-olds, 12-year-olds.

877
01:03:36,072 --> 01:03:39,534
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, how old is the youngest poster, though?

878
01:03:40,415 --> 01:03:41,616
[SPEAKER_20]: We've got, like, DDR Bot.

879
01:03:41,836 --> 01:03:42,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, wow.

880
01:03:42,937 --> 01:03:44,378
[SPEAKER_20]: And isn't DDR Bot, like, 10 or something?

881
01:03:44,398 --> 01:03:45,198
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so, I think so.

882
01:03:45,518 --> 01:03:45,699
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

883
01:03:46,179 --> 01:03:49,001
[SPEAKER_20]: So, the youngest, I think, is probably around 9 or 10.

884
01:03:49,201 --> 01:03:58,047
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's not... We usually don't cause problems about it unless they're causing issues.

885
01:03:58,107 --> 01:04:00,950
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's just a matter of maturity, typically.

886
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:01,570
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you could...

887
01:04:02,512 --> 01:04:06,013
[SPEAKER_20]: So I've met a lot of 16-year-olds that were less mature than the 9-year-olds.

888
01:04:06,894 --> 01:04:07,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, me too.

889
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:15,457
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've dropped the F-bomb quite a lot on DDR Freak on the boards, but, you know, you just... They're going to learn it sometime.

890
01:04:15,937 --> 01:04:17,138
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the way you say it.

891
01:04:17,698 --> 01:04:17,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

892
01:04:18,098 --> 01:04:21,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes it's not what you're saying, it's the way you say it, you know?

893
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:22,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

894
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:25,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I am an instructor of customer service.

895
01:04:27,166 --> 01:04:31,329
[SPEAKER_05]: I can tell you kids, if you ever go out and get a customer service job, your instructor is going to tell you the same thing.

896
01:04:31,449 --> 01:04:32,110
[SPEAKER_20]: Respond.

897
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:32,991
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't react.

898
01:04:33,511 --> 01:04:33,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

899
01:04:34,312 --> 01:04:35,813
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not about what you say.

900
01:04:36,173 --> 01:04:39,295
[SPEAKER_05]: What you say is only 10% of how the information is perceived.

901
01:04:40,216 --> 01:04:42,538
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, 35% of statistics are made up on the spot.

902
01:04:43,238 --> 01:04:44,439
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought it was 43%.

903
01:04:44,539 --> 01:04:44,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

904
01:04:46,501 --> 01:04:47,962
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's how you say it, kids.

905
01:04:48,302 --> 01:04:52,966
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I really don't give a crap about your problem, but let's try what we can do to just BS our way through it.

906
01:04:54,162 --> 01:04:54,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly!

907
01:04:54,982 --> 01:04:58,444
[SPEAKER_05]: See, when DarkSakura said that it had a nice friendly atmosphere to it, you know?

908
01:04:58,964 --> 01:05:01,005
[SPEAKER_18]: Who's been doing customer service for too damn long?

909
01:05:01,865 --> 01:05:02,625
[SPEAKER_18]: As I raise my hand.

910
01:05:05,086 --> 01:05:10,908
[SPEAKER_20]: Ironic enough, I just went through a stupid class in school doing that exact same shit.

911
01:05:12,149 --> 01:05:13,389
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh my god, I hated it.

912
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:17,091
[SPEAKER_20]: All that just for one stinking little piece of paper.

913
01:05:17,111 --> 01:05:18,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

914
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:19,460
[SPEAKER_05]: D.D.R.

915
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:19,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Freak

916
01:05:43,806 --> 01:05:45,767
[SPEAKER_05]: So tune into that, definitely.

917
01:05:45,907 --> 01:05:47,307
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sure with a hefty disclaimer.

918
01:05:48,848 --> 01:05:53,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Just the standard disclaimers that... Well, we have a disclaimer right in the intro to the show.

919
01:05:54,030 --> 01:06:00,853
[SPEAKER_05]: It does say, there may be a scene of nudity in this program, and there may be... This program contains naughty language!

920
01:06:01,994 --> 01:06:02,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, shit!

921
01:06:03,794 --> 01:06:06,776
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it's not my fault if you tuned in halfway through.

922
01:06:07,016 --> 01:06:08,116
[SPEAKER_05]: You should have been here on time.

923
01:06:10,117 --> 01:06:12,238
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not like I started at a different time every single...

924
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:13,621
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, that's right.

925
01:06:13,801 --> 01:06:15,202
[SPEAKER_05]: We're here whether you are or not.

926
01:06:15,822 --> 01:06:19,244
[SPEAKER_05]: And believe me, we've done this show when nobody was here.

927
01:06:22,827 --> 01:06:24,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

928
01:06:24,628 --> 01:06:28,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of nobody being here, I happen to know that a lot of folks weren't here for last week's show.

929
01:06:28,891 --> 01:06:30,852
[SPEAKER_05]: I know because I got the ratings, okay people?

930
01:06:31,292 --> 01:06:36,376
[SPEAKER_05]: So, this Friday on DDR Freak, great chance for you guys to catch that episode if you missed it.

931
01:06:36,416 --> 01:06:37,356
[SPEAKER_05]: So Friday, 6 o'clock.

932
01:06:37,877 --> 01:06:39,698
[SPEAKER_05]: All I'm going to say, I don't want to ruin what went on.

933
01:06:41,072 --> 01:06:44,713
[SPEAKER_05]: But we had our own DDR Freak the movie parody thing going on.

934
01:06:46,693 --> 01:06:47,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Priceless, you gotta hear it.

935
01:06:49,554 --> 01:06:52,795
[SPEAKER_20]: Man, that's a subject that hasn't been heard of for years.

936
01:06:53,515 --> 01:06:55,396
[SPEAKER_05]: We just took that subject and ran away with it.

937
01:06:55,596 --> 01:07:00,757
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that it's old news, but somehow it got brought up last week and we just ran away with it.

938
01:07:01,097 --> 01:07:04,198
[SPEAKER_20]: On a random side note that I just remembered again, Rob?

939
01:07:04,618 --> 01:07:04,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

940
01:07:05,778 --> 01:07:07,619
[SPEAKER_20]: We've been playing DDR for four years now.

941
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:08,840
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

942
01:07:09,161 --> 01:07:12,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my gosh, this is our official four-year anniversary of DDR.

943
01:07:12,503 --> 01:07:12,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

944
01:07:12,824 --> 01:07:13,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Really.

945
01:07:13,344 --> 01:07:13,684
[SPEAKER_20]: Today is?

946
01:07:13,944 --> 01:07:14,745
[SPEAKER_20]: Actually, last Sunday.

947
01:07:14,865 --> 01:07:19,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Not today, but the first day we went to play DDR was sometime between Christmas and New Year's.

948
01:07:19,989 --> 01:07:24,313
[SPEAKER_20]: I played for the first time, well, not for the first first time, but, you know, for first regular time.

949
01:07:24,333 --> 01:07:26,835
[SPEAKER_20]: Like our first regular session was... Yeah, that was on the 26th.

950
01:07:27,714 --> 01:07:30,195
[SPEAKER_05]: A little known fact, Iguana Girl and I played our first game.

951
01:07:30,215 --> 01:07:30,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, actually, no.

952
01:07:30,855 --> 01:07:33,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Most people that listen to the show know that now because I know it's not the first time it's come out.

953
01:07:33,296 --> 01:07:35,536
[SPEAKER_05]: But we played our first game of DDR together in Vegas.

954
01:07:37,077 --> 01:07:37,517
[SPEAKER_21]: October 2000.

955
01:07:38,217 --> 01:07:38,557
[SPEAKER_05]: October 2000.

956
01:07:39,318 --> 01:07:43,559
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we didn't play regularly until one of us spotted the machine at Golfland.

957
01:07:43,579 --> 01:07:43,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it me?

958
01:07:44,198 --> 01:07:44,578
[SPEAKER_20]: You did it.

959
01:07:44,659 --> 01:07:45,559
[SPEAKER_20]: You saw it.

960
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:46,140
[SPEAKER_20]: You played it.

961
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:52,166
[SPEAKER_20]: And then I was jealous because I couldn't play it until the day after Christmas.

962
01:07:52,547 --> 01:07:52,867
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

963
01:07:52,907 --> 01:07:53,448
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember now.

964
01:07:54,709 --> 01:07:55,730
[SPEAKER_05]: My memory's being jogged.

965
01:07:55,770 --> 01:07:57,712
[SPEAKER_20]: I went down there because... You went there on Christmas Eve.

966
01:07:57,812 --> 01:07:59,854
[SPEAKER_05]: I went there to go play pinball or something.

967
01:08:00,335 --> 01:08:03,858
[SPEAKER_20]: So I was all pissed off because you had two more days than me and that's what I kept...

968
01:08:05,911 --> 01:08:08,733
[SPEAKER_21]: The reason why you were so much better than me is because of those three days.

969
01:08:08,853 --> 01:08:14,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazingly enough, suddenly I was passing nine-footers on the third day and just left Iguana Girl in the dust.

970
01:08:14,456 --> 01:08:16,037
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not quite.

971
01:08:16,498 --> 01:08:17,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Not quite, boys and girls.

972
01:08:17,458 --> 01:08:21,281
[SPEAKER_05]: It took me a long time to pass a nine-footer.

973
01:08:22,361 --> 01:08:29,826
[SPEAKER_18]: I remember a certain expedition to a certain golf land in a certain Milpitas to see a certain machine.

974
01:08:30,586 --> 01:08:33,108
[SPEAKER_18]: I remember the first time I met Islander.

975
01:08:34,525 --> 01:08:39,207
[SPEAKER_18]: was at Fanime 2001 when I was cosplaying Emi.

976
01:08:40,787 --> 01:08:41,668
[SPEAKER_20]: No, it wouldn't have been then.

977
01:08:41,748 --> 01:08:44,249
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it was before that, but I mean the first... It was February.

978
01:08:44,469 --> 01:08:44,869
[SPEAKER_18]: February.

979
01:08:45,609 --> 01:08:47,650
[SPEAKER_18]: Right, because of the... The Milpitas trip.

980
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:50,451
[SPEAKER_18]: Right, but the second time then was at Fanime.

981
01:08:51,152 --> 01:08:51,352
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

982
01:08:52,052 --> 01:08:55,113
[SPEAKER_18]: And I was sort of a little standoffish because of the shirt.

983
01:08:55,973 --> 01:08:56,934
[SPEAKER_20]: He was wearing a flip shirt, wasn't he?

984
01:08:56,954 --> 01:08:57,834
[SPEAKER_20]: A flip shirt, yes.

985
01:08:58,835 --> 01:08:59,255
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, boy.

986
01:08:59,295 --> 01:08:59,555
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, boy.

987
01:09:01,539 --> 01:09:02,279
[SPEAKER_22]: It was something to wear.

988
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:03,440
[SPEAKER_22]: It was just something I didn't have.

989
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:05,841
[SPEAKER_22]: At the time, I was collecting just random shirts.

990
01:09:06,681 --> 01:09:09,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, boys and girls, what you don't know is he went home later and changed the oil with it.

991
01:09:10,842 --> 01:09:14,044
[SPEAKER_18]: I also remember that that's when I met a bunch of people in the community.

992
01:09:14,064 --> 01:09:15,664
[SPEAKER_18]: It was at that particular convention.

993
01:09:16,405 --> 01:09:17,325
[SPEAKER_22]: That was a great convention.

994
01:09:17,365 --> 01:09:17,985
[SPEAKER_22]: It really was.

995
01:09:18,585 --> 01:09:18,906
[SPEAKER_18]: It was.

996
01:09:18,986 --> 01:09:22,767
[SPEAKER_18]: I remember sitting on the floor after two days of sleep deprivation.

997
01:09:23,703 --> 01:09:26,564
[SPEAKER_18]: And then Wendell sits next to me, after two days of drinking.

998
01:09:28,385 --> 01:09:34,508
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, he was drunk, I was sleep deprived, so we were both in about the same frame of mind, having an interesting conversation.

999
01:09:35,228 --> 01:09:35,929
[SPEAKER_18]: And then he fell asleep.

1000
01:09:37,329 --> 01:09:41,171
[SPEAKER_22]: I was actually in the arcade room, and I fell asleep on the chair that was right next to the DDR machine.

1001
01:09:41,431 --> 01:09:42,191
[SPEAKER_18]: That big comfy one?

1002
01:09:42,432 --> 01:09:43,192
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yeah, absolutely.

1003
01:09:43,492 --> 01:09:49,795
[SPEAKER_22]: And so I was sitting there, and people were walking up, and they were looking at me going, Oh man, this guy's not doing his job.

1004
01:09:51,156 --> 01:09:51,796
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm like, what's...

1005
01:09:57,696 --> 01:10:02,119
[SPEAKER_18]: My first DDR machine, though, was the year before that at Anime Expo 2000.

1006
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:04,280
[SPEAKER_18]: They had the third mix there.

1007
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:08,442
[SPEAKER_18]: And I was like, why are the arrows have colors?

1008
01:10:10,404 --> 01:10:14,286
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I started playing with the first one on PlayStation in 98.

1009
01:10:15,166 --> 01:10:18,048
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the only one I had ever owned was my second mix on Dreamcast.

1010
01:10:20,151 --> 01:10:21,492
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1011
01:10:50,126 --> 01:10:51,207
[SPEAKER_05]: What's this boy song?

1012
01:10:51,227 --> 01:10:51,927
[SPEAKER_05]: This song's great.

1013
01:10:51,947 --> 01:10:53,268
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, God, you whored that out.

1014
01:10:54,128 --> 01:10:56,169
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, my God, you whored that out.

1015
01:10:57,090 --> 01:10:58,251
[SPEAKER_21]: I was so tired.

1016
01:10:58,371 --> 01:11:02,773
[SPEAKER_05]: I whored Boys by SmileDK on DDR USA.

1017
01:11:02,793 --> 01:11:06,075
[SPEAKER_20]: And it pissed me off because when we were first starting out, it was hard for me.

1018
01:11:06,715 --> 01:11:10,337
[SPEAKER_20]: I was having a hard time doing that on basic.

1019
01:11:10,377 --> 01:11:15,640
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, it's like, it's kind of frustrating, you know, thinking back on it.

1020
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:16,381
[SPEAKER_20]: But, yeah, I was...

1021
01:11:16,929 --> 01:11:23,031
[SPEAKER_20]: Pissed off at the fact that you kept doing boys, because I was like, you're going to kill me!

1022
01:11:23,091 --> 01:11:24,712
[SPEAKER_05]: But I love boys, the song.

1023
01:11:25,232 --> 01:11:25,913
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1024
01:11:26,793 --> 01:11:27,533
[SPEAKER_20]: Sure, the song.

1025
01:11:28,193 --> 01:11:31,215
[SPEAKER_20]: But then again, I forced you through 20 November about 5 billion times, too.

1026
01:11:31,395 --> 01:11:33,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember 20 November-a-thons, yes I do.

1027
01:11:34,216 --> 01:11:34,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

1028
01:11:35,256 --> 01:11:41,799
[SPEAKER_20]: And our massive attempts at trying to take on the board, the high score board.

1029
01:11:42,379 --> 01:11:42,479
Oh.

1030
01:11:43,385 --> 01:11:44,085
[SPEAKER_20]: Those are the days.

1031
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:47,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Back then, that was when Konami was doing their net ranking, right?

1032
01:11:48,448 --> 01:11:56,713
[SPEAKER_20]: And back then, you could score the same on a basic song as you could on a maniac song.

1033
01:11:58,614 --> 01:11:59,815
[SPEAKER_20]: Or it was something like that.

1034
01:11:59,915 --> 01:12:08,059
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think it was... I think what it was is that you... Honestly, there weren't that many people playing DDR yet.

1035
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:12,362
[SPEAKER_05]: So there wasn't that many people on the scoreboards, and we were kind of like, wow, if we could...

1036
01:12:13,191 --> 01:12:16,134
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember at least a couple times that I had to do EOTC five times in a row.

1037
01:12:16,154 --> 01:12:16,674
[SPEAKER_05]: We were in the top five.

1038
01:12:16,694 --> 01:12:16,794
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1039
01:12:16,814 --> 01:12:17,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Were we really?

1040
01:12:17,115 --> 01:12:17,755
[SPEAKER_05]: We were in the top five.

1041
01:12:17,815 --> 01:12:18,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Were we?

1042
01:12:36,502 --> 01:12:38,324
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1043
01:13:02,816 --> 01:13:05,638
[SPEAKER_18]: I worked my ass off to get first place on that damn machine.

1044
01:13:05,718 --> 01:13:06,118
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember.

1045
01:13:06,758 --> 01:13:08,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie was the buns, because she was first and last.

1046
01:13:08,819 --> 01:13:09,499
[SPEAKER_18]: I was first and last.

1047
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:16,222
[SPEAKER_05]: And Brad, lanky style, on Thursday Night's Program, was the meat, because he was in the middle.

1048
01:13:16,262 --> 01:13:18,263
[SPEAKER_05]: He was third, and I was the fruit, second and fourth.

1049
01:13:18,323 --> 01:13:19,464
[SPEAKER_18]: You know how I got first place?

1050
01:13:19,664 --> 01:13:19,864
[SPEAKER_05]: How?

1051
01:13:20,424 --> 01:13:24,666
[SPEAKER_18]: I ended up getting first place by doing Dynamite Rave doubles basic.

1052
01:13:26,967 --> 01:13:27,967
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I see.

1053
01:13:28,067 --> 01:13:30,408
[SPEAKER_05]: You were one of those ones that whored Dynamite Rave in the beginning.

1054
01:13:30,428 --> 01:13:31,689
[SPEAKER_18]: I was one of the ones that whored Dynamite Rave.

1055
01:13:31,729 --> 01:13:35,390
[SPEAKER_18]: But then again, I was very proud because Dynamite Rave was the first five-footer I could do in doubles.

1056
01:13:35,570 --> 01:13:35,930
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all right.

1057
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:37,110
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what song I used to do it?

1058
01:13:37,850 --> 01:13:38,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Love to Me.

1059
01:13:44,352 --> 01:13:44,772
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1060
01:13:45,433 --> 01:13:47,873
[SPEAKER_21]: Nostalgia City.

1061
01:13:48,073 --> 01:13:49,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember when all the cool kids were doing that?

1062
01:13:50,514 --> 01:13:51,695
[SPEAKER_20]: I was never a cool kid.

1063
01:13:52,555 --> 01:13:53,515
[SPEAKER_05]: You never did that?

1064
01:13:53,795 --> 01:13:54,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Not even once?

1065
01:13:54,775 --> 01:13:56,356
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm too fat to do that.

1066
01:13:57,697 --> 01:13:58,277
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm serious!

1067
01:13:58,677 --> 01:14:00,598
[SPEAKER_20]: I would have fallen over if I tried to do that.

1068
01:14:00,618 --> 01:14:03,139
[SPEAKER_05]: I seem to remember that you did some kind of white girl freestyle.

1069
01:14:03,379 --> 01:14:07,460
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I was doing white girl freestyle that didn't require me to actually have to hit the pad with my hands.

1070
01:14:08,061 --> 01:14:09,741
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I... well, alright.

1071
01:14:10,201 --> 01:14:12,522
[SPEAKER_20]: When you get down there, it's hard to bring yourself back up.

1072
01:14:12,542 --> 01:14:13,803
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to bring yourself back up, yeah.

1073
01:14:13,823 --> 01:14:14,523
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one thing to fall.

1074
01:14:14,683 --> 01:14:16,804
[SPEAKER_20]: And you gotta keep in mind that when I first started, I was 270.

1075
01:14:17,084 --> 01:14:21,345
[SPEAKER_20]: So it took me quite a long time to lose my initial 30 pounds.

1076
01:14:21,705 --> 01:14:26,027
[SPEAKER_20]: And, you know, unfortunately I gained more than that back.

1077
01:14:26,147 --> 01:14:26,307
[SPEAKER_20]: But...

1078
01:14:27,028 --> 01:14:28,289
[SPEAKER_20]: I've lost it again, so it doesn't matter.

1079
01:14:29,509 --> 01:14:30,690
[SPEAKER_05]: We're a clean slate now.

1080
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:30,870
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1081
01:14:31,230 --> 01:14:31,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, alright.

1082
01:14:32,991 --> 01:14:50,278
[SPEAKER_05]: But for those of you guys that weren't, you know, you've only been playing DDR since like 4th, Max, whatever, and you kind of missed out on those USA days, if you want to see what we're talking about, go to DDR Freak, look at the step chart for Love To Me Basic, and you'll see several portions of the song.

1083
01:14:50,498 --> 01:14:51,319
[SPEAKER_20]: The left-right jump.

1084
01:14:51,559 --> 01:14:54,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, you have left-right jumps, and then down-up jumps.

1085
01:14:54,955 --> 01:15:03,341
[SPEAKER_05]: So you would jump on left-right, and then hand-plant backwards, and then go forwards.

1086
01:15:03,962 --> 01:15:07,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you demonstrating on cam, even though it only updates every 30 seconds?

1087
01:15:07,184 --> 01:15:07,585
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

1088
01:15:08,926 --> 01:15:12,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Islander will demonstrate in super slow motion for you to see this guy's on cam.

1089
01:15:13,129 --> 01:15:17,552
[SPEAKER_05]: He looks like he's going to take a shit.

1090
01:15:17,632 --> 01:15:20,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully we'll see something on cam.

1091
01:15:22,936 --> 01:15:24,237
[SPEAKER_21]: He's taking a backward shit.

1092
01:15:27,293 --> 01:15:29,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes I wish we were a TV show, I really do.

1093
01:15:30,674 --> 01:15:31,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1094
01:15:32,435 --> 01:15:34,315
[SPEAKER_18]: So that we could get booed by the Nilsons?

1095
01:15:36,476 --> 01:15:40,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Please, our ratings couldn't be any worse than G4 Tech TV, come on.

1096
01:15:43,077 --> 01:15:45,898
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're getting beat by the Golf Channel, okay, something's wrong.

1097
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:50,279
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, Tech TV came up in conversation over lunch today.

1098
01:15:50,559 --> 01:15:50,920
[SPEAKER_05]: How so?

1099
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:52,320
[SPEAKER_18]: The Soul Calibur dates.

1100
01:15:54,662 --> 01:15:55,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Soul Calibur dates?

1101
01:15:56,103 --> 01:16:02,307
[SPEAKER_18]: Dan was telling me about something they had on Tech TV where they had someone going on a blind date with Cervantes from Soul Calibur.

1102
01:16:03,008 --> 01:16:04,028
[SPEAKER_18]: What are you going to have for dinner?

1103
01:16:05,069 --> 01:16:06,490
[SPEAKER_05]: I want your soul!

1104
01:16:07,491 --> 01:16:08,671
[SPEAKER_05]: We never had Tech TV.

1105
01:16:08,691 --> 01:16:12,854
[SPEAKER_05]: It was G4 and then G4 basically assimilated Tech TV.

1106
01:16:13,134 --> 01:16:14,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I didn't see it.

1107
01:16:16,797 --> 01:16:17,077
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1108
01:16:17,577 --> 01:16:18,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know what?

1109
01:16:18,298 --> 01:16:24,382
[SPEAKER_05]: If any G4 Tech TV people are listening, as much as we give you guys shit, we would sell our souls to you in a minute, so call me.

1110
01:16:28,249 --> 01:16:29,790
[SPEAKER_05]: I think now's a good time.

1111
01:16:29,870 --> 01:16:30,991
[SPEAKER_05]: On that note, let's go to a break.

1112
01:16:58,203 --> 01:17:01,787
[SPEAKER_05]: We could do some music that would remind us of the good old days.

1113
01:17:04,489 --> 01:17:10,575
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's start it off with... I'm looking, I'm looking to see if I can find it.

1114
01:17:10,695 --> 01:17:11,716
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's this one.

1115
01:17:12,316 --> 01:17:13,778
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be right back after this, boys and girls.

1116
01:17:14,138 --> 01:17:17,381
[SPEAKER_05]: And everybody, when you hear this song, practice.

1117
01:17:17,561 --> 01:17:20,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Get up off your chair and practice the move that Islander was just showing you.

1118
01:17:20,824 --> 01:17:21,245
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back.

1119
01:17:39,611 --> 01:17:42,005
[SPEAKER_08]: What's your name, Brian, and what's your storyline?

1120
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:12,198
[SPEAKER_15]: Dreaming, dreaming, grooving, if you know what I mean, it's moving on the scene, alright Take the bumping, take the whining, take the moving, I'm with the DarkSakura King

1121
01:19:35,999 --> 01:19:36,920
Thanks for watching!

1122
01:20:22,455 --> 01:20:23,557
Thanks for watching!

1123
01:20:57,231 --> 01:20:58,773
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

1124
01:21:28,951 --> 01:21:30,332
Thank you for watching!

1125
01:22:01,658 --> 01:22:04,859
[SPEAKER_05]: With apologies to Iguana Girl, I can't resist this next one.

1126
01:23:40,152 --> 01:23:50,354
[SPEAKER_17]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1127
01:23:51,934 --> 01:23:53,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Jess, I just couldn't resist.

1128
01:23:53,615 --> 01:23:57,696
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's been like a good, like what, three, four years since you heard it last, maybe?

1129
01:24:00,356 --> 01:24:02,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, so many memories, so little time.

1130
01:24:04,137 --> 01:24:04,837
[SPEAKER_05]: How can I choose?

1131
01:24:05,868 --> 01:24:07,449
[SPEAKER_18]: That's still the sluttiest song ever.

1132
01:24:09,369 --> 01:24:11,190
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm being told F you in the chatroom, thank you.

1133
01:24:11,290 --> 01:24:13,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, we'll get to the F yous a week a little later, alright?

1134
01:24:18,413 --> 01:24:21,073
[SPEAKER_02]: She's not... I'm Sawi.

1135
01:24:22,134 --> 01:24:22,654
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Sawi.

1136
01:24:23,895 --> 01:24:24,415
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Sawi.

1137
01:24:25,355 --> 01:24:26,115
[SPEAKER_02]: I will be Fawi.

1138
01:24:27,756 --> 01:24:28,656
[SPEAKER_02]: She's typing messages.

1139
01:24:29,156 --> 01:24:30,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, she says I'm not cute.

1140
01:24:39,133 --> 01:24:40,034
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1141
01:24:57,057 --> 01:24:58,018
[SPEAKER_05]: and a couple minutes here.

1142
01:24:58,238 --> 01:25:02,000
[SPEAKER_05]: I opened it up for a particular person to get through, which I'm hoping to hear from in just a second here.

1143
01:25:03,441 --> 01:25:10,946
[SPEAKER_05]: In the meantime, I thought maybe we would kind of start moving into the sim update for this week.

1144
01:25:11,306 --> 01:25:16,909
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Loki's got a lot he wants to say for the sim update, so I'll let him get started, but just keep in mind I might have to pick up a call midway through.

1145
01:25:16,969 --> 01:25:17,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

1146
01:25:18,070 --> 01:25:18,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.

1147
01:25:18,590 --> 01:25:22,473
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad I'm top priority there.

1148
01:25:23,553 --> 01:25:24,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, um,

1149
01:25:25,154 --> 01:25:29,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, this week there's a few things as opposed to the normal nothing.

1150
01:25:30,981 --> 01:25:41,092
[SPEAKER_07]: DDRUK, still new, no new sim files, they're still waiting on beginner steps for the Ultramix 2 stuff, but it's close to being done, so that's good.

1151
01:25:42,227 --> 01:26:00,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than that, there's also a little theme that just got released on Bomani Cell right now, only because DDR Mania X is down, and that theme would be Techno Fiend 3, that's right, the most kickass skin ever for Step Mania has now released its final version of it, and it's awesome.

1152
01:26:01,997 --> 01:26:06,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I don't even play Step Mania, really, and I know what Techno Fiend is, okay?

1153
01:26:06,099 --> 01:26:06,740
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that good.

1154
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:08,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I really think the skin is great.

1155
01:26:08,841 --> 01:26:12,223
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it just, whoever did the work on that, kudos to you.

1156
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:37,144
[SPEAKER_07]: It is the sexiest skin out there, and you gotta check it out, it's just, it's really awesome, lots of humor and little Easter eggs thrown in the background there, but, um, it's just, it's really nice looking, they've added, um, it's just completely redone almost, and I don't know how to describe it, it's just very well put together, very, um, optimized, and just runs really well, um,

1157
01:26:38,874 --> 01:26:40,776
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, you'll have to go check it out.

1158
01:26:40,816 --> 01:26:45,379
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of hard to find right now, only because, you know, DDR Maniacs is down.

1159
01:26:45,980 --> 01:26:54,386
[SPEAKER_07]: So what you need to do is go to my style, go to their DDR sim file section there, and just do a search for Technofiend.

1160
01:26:54,406 --> 01:26:58,109
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll find it probably, it's actually on the second or third page on there right now.

1161
01:26:58,789 --> 01:27:01,692
[SPEAKER_07]: And you should find it to download, and it's awesome.

1162
01:27:01,872 --> 01:27:07,096
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a good 14 megs, but it is a really good sim skin.

1163
01:27:08,270 --> 01:27:24,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than that, there's also the OSC3 Plus Remix, which is the step-file contest where they had all the songs where they're taking new steps or they're being remixed or whatever.

1164
01:27:25,602 --> 01:27:52,954
[SPEAKER_07]: that's available for download also on my style and they also have their own download pack that's available right now with just I think a couple more sim files and it's DR5Key Classics is the theme for this one so check those out over there as well and that's all okay for those that don't really know what Technofiend is all about what exactly makes this skin so damn cool

1165
01:27:53,837 --> 01:27:54,578
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1166
01:28:10,678 --> 01:28:13,939
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say Star Wars because it has a lot of Star Wars parodies in it, but not really.

1167
01:28:13,999 --> 01:28:16,279
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's just very different.

1168
01:28:16,319 --> 01:28:17,899
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes DDR all futuristic.

1169
01:28:17,919 --> 01:28:21,620
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes it feel like a 2010 game or something, you know.

1170
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:23,400
[SPEAKER_05]: It just gives a very futuristic theme to it.

1171
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:24,681
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be the way I would put it.

1172
01:28:25,741 --> 01:28:26,301
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's sexy.

1173
01:28:27,301 --> 01:28:28,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that would probably be the way.

1174
01:28:29,262 --> 01:28:33,802
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like what a new, if they were to reinvent DDR and release it now, what it would look like.

1175
01:28:34,923 --> 01:28:36,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, maybe not, because, you know...

1176
01:28:38,068 --> 01:28:45,350
[SPEAKER_07]: If they were to, you know, spend the amount of time that they did on, like, finding good music with designing the interface, this is what it would look like.

1177
01:28:47,510 --> 01:28:47,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1178
01:28:48,030 --> 01:28:49,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Any comments from anybody else about Techno Fiend?

1179
01:28:49,711 --> 01:28:51,211
[SPEAKER_18]: I know... It was purdy.

1180
01:28:51,851 --> 01:28:52,732
[SPEAKER_05]: You saw a little bit of it?

1181
01:28:52,772 --> 01:28:53,532
[SPEAKER_18]: It was purdy.

1182
01:28:53,672 --> 01:28:53,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1183
01:28:54,312 --> 01:28:54,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Very pretty.

1184
01:28:55,892 --> 01:28:57,733
[SPEAKER_18]: And, Jazz... I felt excited.

1185
01:28:58,373 --> 01:29:00,113
[SPEAKER_05]: You've used this Techno Fiend before, yes?

1186
01:29:00,373 --> 01:29:00,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Not yet.

1187
01:29:00,873 --> 01:29:04,854
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the first time I've seen it, but I'm definitely going to download it when I get back to Walnut Creek today.

1188
01:29:05,295 --> 01:29:05,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1189
01:29:05,855 --> 01:29:06,315
[SPEAKER_07]: It's sexy.

1190
01:29:06,595 --> 01:29:06,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

1191
01:29:07,015 --> 01:29:07,335
[SPEAKER_07]: It's sexy.

1192
01:29:09,116 --> 01:29:09,436
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1193
01:29:11,198 --> 01:29:11,518
[SPEAKER_05]: What now?

1194
01:29:11,578 --> 01:29:18,645
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess we're going to go ahead and get into the cage match, and we'll come back, and hopefully that call we can get to, and then... The new game.

1195
01:29:18,665 --> 01:29:19,606
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about the new game now?

1196
01:29:20,087 --> 01:29:20,887
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I keep putting it off.

1197
01:29:20,907 --> 01:29:21,928
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's talk about the new game now.

1198
01:29:22,089 --> 01:29:22,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about the new game.

1199
01:29:24,378 --> 01:29:29,901
[SPEAKER_05]: So I finally got to check out this game for the PlayStation 2, thanks to Islander and Iguana Girl bringing it over for me.

1200
01:29:30,601 --> 01:29:35,244
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Technic Beat, and this game's actually been out for like two months, right?

1201
01:29:35,284 --> 01:29:39,466
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been out a little while, but I'm just now getting to see it, because I somehow completely missed this game.

1202
01:29:39,886 --> 01:29:44,428
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard about it like a month ago, but I'd really missed it somehow.

1203
01:29:46,269 --> 01:29:47,770
[SPEAKER_05]: You're pretty familiar with this game, right, Jazz?

1204
01:29:47,950 --> 01:29:48,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1205
01:29:48,590 --> 01:29:49,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell us about how this game works.

1206
01:29:50,635 --> 01:29:53,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the way this game works is very interesting.

1207
01:29:53,996 --> 01:30:03,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, you choose a character, and you start walking around on a kind of liquidy-type surface, and then circles will appear.

1208
01:30:04,179 --> 01:30:06,920
[SPEAKER_03]: And then little circles will appear coming from it.

1209
01:30:07,420 --> 01:30:12,042
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you think of the big circles as, like, guide arrows in DDR...

1210
01:30:13,086 --> 01:30:41,752
[SPEAKER_03]: and the little circles coming out towards the other circle like the actual arrows then that's what it's kind of like it's basically you want to hit the ripples right so basically you have a little character you start running around and start hitting the ripples and the game is full of a bunch of Namco original songs like old school Namco stuff like Thema Daruga and Pac-Mania Pac-Mania which is awesome Dig Dug even Point Blank but now there's kind of a tie into Bomani isn't there here

1211
01:30:42,230 --> 01:30:42,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Pac-Mania

1212
01:31:07,245 --> 01:31:08,306
[SPEAKER_05]: That I heard you play was awesome.

1213
01:31:08,426 --> 01:31:09,026
[SPEAKER_05]: That was good.

1214
01:31:09,046 --> 01:31:10,928
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was by Sampling Masters Mega, right?

1215
01:31:11,148 --> 01:31:11,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably.

1216
01:31:11,348 --> 01:31:11,768
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the two.

1217
01:31:11,888 --> 01:31:12,249
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the two.

1218
01:31:12,309 --> 01:31:12,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1219
01:31:12,869 --> 01:31:13,169
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1220
01:31:13,830 --> 01:31:14,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Good stuff.

1221
01:31:15,791 --> 01:31:17,773
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a little... Like, it was different, though.

1222
01:31:17,853 --> 01:31:21,235
[SPEAKER_05]: It was very different compared to other music games I play lately, which is good, though.

1223
01:31:21,555 --> 01:31:27,560
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they need to get away from the moving thing towards the line and stuff.

1224
01:31:27,580 --> 01:31:29,881
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, every game's starting to look like DDR.

1225
01:31:29,901 --> 01:31:33,264
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot more obscure, and that's what I like about it, because it has...

1226
01:31:33,922 --> 01:31:37,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like you said, a lot of things are basically wait for it to get to this screen.

1227
01:31:38,363 --> 01:31:38,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1228
01:31:39,203 --> 01:31:39,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1229
01:31:39,463 --> 01:31:39,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1230
01:31:39,803 --> 01:31:43,744
[SPEAKER_03]: This one you have to run around and some characters can't run fast.

1231
01:31:44,004 --> 01:31:46,225
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have to kick the notes around sometimes.

1232
01:31:46,305 --> 01:31:51,146
[SPEAKER_05]: And then depending on which note you hit, you'll actually kind of change the pitch of the music.

1233
01:31:51,186 --> 01:31:51,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1234
01:31:51,526 --> 01:31:52,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is pretty cool, I think.

1235
01:31:52,707 --> 01:31:56,087
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of fun to sometimes play it and you get to remix your own a little bit.

1236
01:31:56,247 --> 01:31:56,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1237
01:31:56,428 --> 01:31:58,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of like Amplitude allows you to do in a way.

1238
01:31:58,408 --> 01:31:58,728
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit.

1239
01:31:58,748 --> 01:31:59,068
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit.

1240
01:31:59,088 --> 01:32:01,609
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have a remix mode in the game where you can make your own stuff.

1241
01:32:01,729 --> 01:32:02,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, right.

1242
01:32:02,209 --> 01:32:02,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1243
01:32:02,589 --> 01:32:04,490
[SPEAKER_05]: And there look to be a lot of modes in Technic Beat.

1244
01:32:04,510 --> 01:32:06,010
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't really get to play with a lot of the others.

1245
01:32:06,050 --> 01:32:07,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you checked out some of the other modes?

1246
01:32:07,471 --> 01:32:14,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, it's basically the normal stuff they have, like non-stop mode is in there, free mode, like 2DX is in free mode.

1247
01:32:14,313 --> 01:32:22,716
[SPEAKER_03]: After you play a song, it's unlocked in free mode, which is hard because there's not really a way to keep track of the songs you've passed in regular game modes.

1248
01:32:22,736 --> 01:32:25,497
[SPEAKER_03]: You're kind of guessing which ones you've passed already in free mode.

1249
01:32:25,817 --> 01:32:29,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you go back and check, oh, that's unlocked, yay, oh, that's, nah.

1250
01:32:30,185 --> 01:32:35,487
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, it gets a little annoying, but still it's a great game because it has about 80 songs.

1251
01:32:36,607 --> 01:32:37,548
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's only $20.

1252
01:32:37,808 --> 01:32:40,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's one of these budget games.

1253
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:43,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Namco did this one, right?

1254
01:32:45,051 --> 01:32:50,513
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was Mastiff and Eureka, which are basically a branch off of Namco.

1255
01:32:50,633 --> 01:32:56,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, but Katamari Damashii was also by Namco, and I think these two games came out together, actually, didn't they?

1256
01:32:56,555 --> 01:32:56,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1257
01:32:57,402 --> 01:33:01,006
[SPEAKER_03]: This only came out in the same manner.

1258
01:33:01,106 --> 01:33:05,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it wasn't released that much because they didn't think there was going to be a high demand for it.

1259
01:33:05,671 --> 01:33:09,635
[SPEAKER_03]: And there hasn't been, so it's kind of like... At least for Technic Beat, there hasn't been.

1260
01:33:09,675 --> 01:33:13,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, Katamari Damacy, they probably thought the same thing going into it, but boy, were they wrong.

1261
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:14,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

1262
01:33:14,461 --> 01:33:14,661
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

1263
01:33:16,031 --> 01:33:42,795
[SPEAKER_05]: and I but Technic Beat and we've got a lot of folks in our chat room saying they never even heard of this game yeah so and it's not you know not surprising at all but it is a new music rhythm game that's out there and it's kind of different the way it works you're not going to know a lot of the songs in there are going to be unfamiliar to you unless you play a lot of old school 80s arcade games if you're a mame whore like you have you're a mame whore you've got that multi what does that mean multi arcade machine emulator that is exactly it oh I'm oh I remembered um

1264
01:33:43,644 --> 01:33:53,454
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've got that on your computer and you have all these ROMs from crazy places of games you've never heard of, which you're not supposed to do because that's illegal, boys and girls, and I'm not encouraging you to do that.

1265
01:33:53,474 --> 01:33:59,139
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying if you've already done it, then you probably are familiar with a lot of these old games and they've remixed a lot of these old themes, which is cool.

1266
01:34:00,901 --> 01:34:02,783
[SPEAKER_05]: So, check it out.

1267
01:34:02,963 --> 01:34:03,223
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only $20.

1268
01:34:05,683 --> 01:34:11,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, this would be a great opportunity to sell it on our website, but we just, you know, we're not that smart.

1269
01:34:12,546 --> 01:34:13,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Cry.

1270
01:34:13,626 --> 01:34:13,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh well.

1271
01:34:14,587 --> 01:34:20,689
[SPEAKER_19]: I did see that game while I was Christmas shopping, and the first thing I thought was, ooh, should I get that?

1272
01:34:21,109 --> 01:34:22,049
[SPEAKER_19]: No, what if it sucks?

1273
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:25,831
[SPEAKER_19]: But now I know, so I might just have to go down and get it tomorrow.

1274
01:34:28,072 --> 01:34:33,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, speaking of music games that suck, I know Islander, you got a chance to play one not too long ago, right?

1275
01:34:36,465 --> 01:34:37,686
[SPEAKER_22]: Music games that suck?

1276
01:34:38,046 --> 01:34:41,888
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1277
01:34:42,069 --> 01:34:43,149
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, Jesus Christ.

1278
01:34:43,169 --> 01:34:45,691
[SPEAKER_22]: Let me give you a hint.

1279
01:34:45,711 --> 01:34:46,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me give you a hint.

1280
01:34:47,072 --> 01:34:51,315
[SPEAKER_05]: All those people complaining about GameCube DDR, there's something out there for you.

1281
01:34:52,055 --> 01:34:53,816
[SPEAKER_22]: And really, you're not missing out.

1282
01:34:54,937 --> 01:34:58,179
[SPEAKER_22]: It's by MadCatz, who, you know...

1283
01:34:59,625 --> 01:35:09,347
[SPEAKER_22]: for a long time have been making third-party controllers and such, and memory cards and other various accessories, but this being their first game, it was lacking.

1284
01:35:09,467 --> 01:35:10,428
[SPEAKER_22]: Boy, was it lacking.

1285
01:35:11,148 --> 01:35:12,008
[SPEAKER_05]: That's putting it lightly.

1286
01:35:12,528 --> 01:35:13,608
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, yes, very lightly.

1287
01:35:14,169 --> 01:35:15,329
[SPEAKER_22]: It was a pile of steaming poopy.

1288
01:35:15,689 --> 01:35:21,070
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, yeah, the one saving grace was that the soundtrack wasn't bad.

1289
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:23,331
[SPEAKER_22]: I liked a lot of the music in there.

1290
01:35:25,463 --> 01:35:30,947
[SPEAKER_22]: Dear Lord, do I really have to play the full-length, five-minute version of Parents Just Don't Understand on eight arrows?

1291
01:35:31,187 --> 01:35:32,048
[SPEAKER_22]: Do I really need to do this?

1292
01:35:32,988 --> 01:35:34,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Do the arrows even make any sense?

1293
01:35:35,590 --> 01:35:42,535
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, imagine we were just discussing Technic Beat, how it has a circle and another circle that comes out to meet it.

1294
01:35:43,656 --> 01:35:46,678
[SPEAKER_22]: Your arrows are set up in a circular manner.

1295
01:35:47,138 --> 01:35:49,159
[SPEAKER_22]: You have up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals.

1296
01:35:50,020 --> 01:35:54,103
[SPEAKER_22]: And the arrows appear from the center and move outward.

1297
01:35:55,049 --> 01:35:56,330
[SPEAKER_22]: It's very strange looking.

1298
01:35:56,931 --> 01:35:59,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is confusing to begin with, a setup like that.

1299
01:35:59,332 --> 01:36:05,657
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, another option is the scroll mode, which makes it turn, which turns it into DDR, but up and down are switched.

1300
01:36:08,379 --> 01:36:09,420
[SPEAKER_22]: And that was really confusing too.

1301
01:36:10,141 --> 01:36:11,282
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, exactly.

1302
01:36:12,343 --> 01:36:16,606
[SPEAKER_22]: That was like just, uh, I'm not, damn it.

1303
01:36:21,322 --> 01:36:21,782
[SPEAKER_22]: It was real bad.

1304
01:36:22,122 --> 01:36:28,064
[SPEAKER_22]: As a matter of fact, I played it for about maybe 30 minutes, looked at Iwana Girl and said, this is a piece of crap.

1305
01:36:28,944 --> 01:36:35,105
[SPEAKER_22]: Threw it back in the box, went back to GameStop the very next day and said, you know what, let me get a game that is actually cool.

1306
01:36:35,906 --> 01:36:36,926
[SPEAKER_22]: Can I try this in for Mario Party 6?

1307
01:36:40,607 --> 01:36:46,348
[SPEAKER_22]: And sure enough, I was able to do that and get some money reimbursed to me, and I was very happy about that.

1308
01:36:47,165 --> 01:36:47,865
[SPEAKER_05]: MC Groove's Dance Graze

1309
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:06,411
[SPEAKER_22]: How much was it?

1310
01:37:07,052 --> 01:37:07,512
[SPEAKER_22]: At the time, $60.

1311
01:37:09,153 --> 01:37:10,234
[SPEAKER_22]: Right now, it's going for $50.

1312
01:37:10,514 --> 01:37:13,157
[SPEAKER_22]: You've got to be kidding me.

1313
01:37:13,197 --> 01:37:14,478
[SPEAKER_22]: Does it come with a pad or something?

1314
01:37:14,518 --> 01:37:15,719
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, it comes with a game and a pad.

1315
01:37:15,739 --> 01:37:16,139
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, but still.

1316
01:37:16,179 --> 01:37:17,320
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, exactly.

1317
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:17,881
[SPEAKER_22]: Exactly.

1318
01:37:18,141 --> 01:37:19,022
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, it was horrible.

1319
01:37:19,342 --> 01:37:21,624
[SPEAKER_18]: But even the Mad Catz pad wouldn't be worth $50.

1320
01:37:21,724 --> 01:37:23,265
[SPEAKER_18]: It sucks.

1321
01:37:24,126 --> 01:37:26,808
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, it actually worked well, but I was like, oh.

1322
01:37:28,009 --> 01:37:29,270
[SPEAKER_22]: Just, oh, it's just bad.

1323
01:37:29,911 --> 01:37:30,952
[SPEAKER_22]: People, stay away, please.

1324
01:37:33,991 --> 01:37:35,673
[SPEAKER_22]: Get On The Mic Get On The Mic

1325
01:37:47,498 --> 01:37:48,999
[SPEAKER_22]: The game itself is actually pretty interesting.

1326
01:37:49,019 --> 01:38:03,425
[SPEAKER_22]: It uses a lot of, I mean, of course, it's all hip-hop, but it ranges from stuff like the newer stuff, oh gosh, like Turn It Up and some other strange things, or like Party Up DMX, to like old school stuff like Humpty Dance.

1327
01:38:05,246 --> 01:38:16,554
[SPEAKER_22]: and the characters are just hilarious because there's this one stage where you're just starting out your career and you're in your bathroom looking at yourself in the mirror trying to be all hardcore.

1328
01:38:16,674 --> 01:38:17,895
[SPEAKER_22]: Wasn't that a scene in 8 Mile?

1329
01:38:18,495 --> 01:38:19,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, basically.

1330
01:38:19,896 --> 01:38:30,204
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's funny because your boombox is on the shelf and it's bouncing and if you're doing well, the whole room starts bouncing and having fun.

1331
01:38:30,224 --> 01:38:31,005
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1332
01:38:31,565 --> 01:38:32,786
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, pretty much.

1333
01:38:33,487 --> 01:38:34,988
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like Parappa's bathroom level.

1334
01:38:35,569 --> 01:38:36,770
[SPEAKER_22]: Basically, there you go.

1335
01:38:37,350 --> 01:38:37,771
[SPEAKER_22]: There you go.

1336
01:38:38,071 --> 01:38:40,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Except he's not rapping about having to go to the bathroom.

1337
01:38:40,433 --> 01:38:42,775
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but that's honestly my favorite song in that game.

1338
01:38:43,175 --> 01:38:43,756
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I know.

1339
01:38:44,036 --> 01:38:44,837
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.

1340
01:38:44,897 --> 01:38:45,477
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great song.

1341
01:38:46,398 --> 01:38:49,321
[SPEAKER_05]: In the rain or in the snow, I really gotta go.

1342
01:38:49,821 --> 01:38:58,689
[SPEAKER_05]: That made me laugh so hard I peed a little.

1343
01:39:00,970 --> 01:39:04,372
[SPEAKER_22]: But yeah, people, please stay away from NC Crew's Dance Grace, please.

1344
01:39:05,253 --> 01:39:12,517
[SPEAKER_05]: That reminds me, I got to check out a little bit of Donkey Konga this week, because one of my buddies got it for Christmas, and he said, you have to play, you have to play it.

1345
01:39:12,537 --> 01:39:17,480
[SPEAKER_05]: So he brought it over, kind of like how you guys brought it over a couple weeks ago, but this time I actually had time to play it.

1346
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:20,681
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel bad, because you guys brought those games, we didn't even really get to them.

1347
01:39:21,242 --> 01:39:23,563
[SPEAKER_05]: But, got to play a little more Donkey Konga.

1348
01:39:23,603 --> 01:39:28,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I'd seen it at E3, and really, the game was pretty much what I remembered at E3.

1349
01:39:28,386 --> 01:39:30,107
[SPEAKER_05]: There wasn't a whole lot different, but it's just...

1350
01:39:30,535 --> 01:39:31,095
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fun!

1351
01:39:31,396 --> 01:39:32,056
[SPEAKER_05]: It really is.

1352
01:39:32,256 --> 01:39:35,938
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some songs in there that are really freaking cute.

1353
01:39:36,338 --> 01:39:41,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, there's a cover of, uh, I think I love you, so what am I so afraid of?

1354
01:39:41,121 --> 01:39:45,623
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's all, like, Happy Britney style, kind of, but not, like, Britney bad, but, like, you know.

1355
01:39:45,663 --> 01:39:47,724
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, but it has that, like, cute Nazi feel to it.

1356
01:39:47,844 --> 01:39:48,265
[SPEAKER_05]: It does.

1357
01:39:48,965 --> 01:39:52,227
[SPEAKER_05]: We gotta get some of those songs and get them on Orange Lounge Radio, because there's some really cute Donkey Konga songs.

1358
01:39:52,287 --> 01:39:53,467
[SPEAKER_22]: Absolutely, that would be cool.

1359
01:39:53,668 --> 01:39:59,991
[SPEAKER_05]: But then there's some, like, really, really, like, okay, this game is obviously for five-year-old songs, because there's, like, the Campfire Medley.

1360
01:40:02,602 --> 01:40:05,784
[SPEAKER_22]: There's Foster's Medley in Taiko Drum Master too.

1361
01:40:06,224 --> 01:40:08,045
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm like, what the hell is this?

1362
01:40:08,765 --> 01:40:11,286
[SPEAKER_05]: I came this close to picking up Taiko Drum Master today.

1363
01:40:11,326 --> 01:40:15,348
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw it sitting on the shelf and I was like, it's calling my name.

1364
01:40:15,368 --> 01:40:16,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Get it, get it.

1365
01:40:16,408 --> 01:40:20,430
[SPEAKER_05]: But then I was like, I must save money for something else.

1366
01:40:21,951 --> 01:40:22,711
[SPEAKER_18]: I want that game.

1367
01:40:23,952 --> 01:40:26,493
[SPEAKER_18]: But I still want a freaking second pair of maracas.

1368
01:40:27,979 --> 01:40:30,400
[SPEAKER_09]: They stopped making Samba de Amigo like three years ago.

1369
01:40:30,420 --> 01:40:32,000
[SPEAKER_18]: I wanted them to bring out the tambourine one.

1370
01:40:32,721 --> 01:40:34,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, the tambourine game?

1371
01:40:34,321 --> 01:40:36,422
[SPEAKER_18]: I would be all over the freaking tambourine game.

1372
01:40:36,542 --> 01:40:41,604
[SPEAKER_05]: This coming from somebody who has played Dance Dance Revolution, Para Para Paradise.

1373
01:40:42,684 --> 01:40:46,986
[SPEAKER_05]: I've played just about almost every music game out there.

1374
01:40:49,824 --> 01:40:53,686
[SPEAKER_05]: The Tambourine Game is the gayest music game I've ever played.

1375
01:41:12,125 --> 01:41:13,306
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate the eye toy.

1376
01:41:40,854 --> 01:41:41,474
[SPEAKER_05]: So travesty.

1377
01:41:41,935 --> 01:41:42,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, just curious.

1378
01:41:44,056 --> 01:41:44,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1379
01:41:46,337 --> 01:41:46,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1380
01:41:47,778 --> 01:41:48,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, how about that cage match?

1381
01:41:48,939 --> 01:41:49,819
[SPEAKER_05]: How about that cage match?

1382
01:41:49,839 --> 01:41:51,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get into the cage match.

1383
01:41:51,660 --> 01:41:52,581
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to get into it here.

1384
01:41:56,843 --> 01:42:04,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, last week in the Orange Lounge Radio cage match, we were missing a host, so we didn't get a song, because Jamie was out sick.

1385
01:42:04,228 --> 01:42:04,628
[SPEAKER_18]: Got the name.

1386
01:42:05,328 --> 01:42:05,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

1387
01:42:05,929 --> 01:42:07,310
[SPEAKER_18]: Shakato Tambourine, I think.

1388
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:07,670
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh.

1389
01:42:07,690 --> 01:42:07,770
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh.

1390
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:10,121
[SPEAKER_05]: So, what, shake that tambourine, basically?

1391
01:42:10,141 --> 01:42:10,581
[SPEAKER_18]: Basically.

1392
01:42:10,662 --> 01:42:10,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1393
01:42:11,322 --> 01:42:26,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, we were down to host last week, so we let you guys, the listeners, do something that you have been begging us to do for years now, and that is a chatroom choice song for the cage match.

1394
01:42:26,391 --> 01:42:31,914
[SPEAKER_05]: So we let a random chatroom listener, which was, I believe it was Big Red Pimp ended up picking this, right?

1395
01:42:31,934 --> 01:42:33,615
[SPEAKER_05]: And Angel, you helped them find it or something?

1396
01:42:34,437 --> 01:42:41,040
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, no, actually he already had it, and he told me what it was over private message, and I'm like, ooh, that's cool.

1397
01:42:41,420 --> 01:42:42,621
[SPEAKER_19]: So it was all him.

1398
01:42:43,501 --> 01:42:47,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so we had everybody in the chatroom submit a random entry, and we picked one at random, and it was this one.

1399
01:42:48,523 --> 01:42:53,545
[SPEAKER_05]: And sure enough, you let the chatroom put a song in the cage match, and of course they're going to vote for it, so that song won.

1400
01:42:53,565 --> 01:42:57,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I thought you had a comment.

1401
01:42:57,347 --> 01:42:57,507
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

1402
01:42:58,786 --> 01:43:04,891
[SPEAKER_05]: What that means is that Cage Match is all screwed up now because we have a chatroom choice sitting there in the Cage Match.

1403
01:43:04,951 --> 01:43:07,973
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we're going to do is this.

1404
01:43:08,814 --> 01:43:14,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Since Jamie stepped aside last week for the chatroom choice, I will step aside this week so the chatroom choice can be in.

1405
01:43:14,698 --> 01:43:18,001
[SPEAKER_05]: And if, for whatever reason, it wins again, Loki will be out next week.

1406
01:43:18,161 --> 01:43:18,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay?

1407
01:43:19,097 --> 01:43:21,199
[SPEAKER_18]: That means you just didn't want to pick a song to sing.

1408
01:43:21,459 --> 01:43:23,120
[SPEAKER_05]: No, because I have a good song.

1409
01:43:23,540 --> 01:43:26,142
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a good song, but I'm going to step aside this week.

1410
01:43:26,162 --> 01:43:28,023
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you listen, by the way, at my suggestion?

1411
01:43:28,243 --> 01:43:29,084
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't had a chance to.

1412
01:43:29,124 --> 01:43:31,005
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to hear it for the first time tonight, so we'll see.

1413
01:43:31,125 --> 01:43:31,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, here we go.

1414
01:43:32,566 --> 01:43:35,628
[SPEAKER_05]: So song number one, last week's winner, is a group.

1415
01:43:35,928 --> 01:43:37,950
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys know this one if you listen to any J-rock.

1416
01:43:38,030 --> 01:43:41,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Larkin Seal did this song, and the song is called Ready, Steady, Go.

1417
01:43:41,932 --> 01:43:44,274
[SPEAKER_05]: And no, it's not anything like the Paul Oakenfold one, okay?

1418
01:43:44,294 --> 01:43:44,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1419
01:43:45,646 --> 01:43:50,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so again, the way the cage match works, we play three songs for your listening pleasure or displeasure.

1420
01:43:51,309 --> 01:44:00,713
[SPEAKER_05]: You pick your favorite, and your favorite song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Launch Radio's Hermione Music and More program, which runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on this station when we're not live.

1421
01:44:01,373 --> 01:44:02,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so here it is.

1422
01:44:04,034 --> 01:44:11,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and remember, you've got to be in our chat room to participate, so head on over to www.orangelaunchradio.com and click on chat now so you can participate.

1423
01:44:11,638 --> 01:44:13,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, that being said, here it is.

1424
01:44:13,098 --> 01:44:14,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Song number one, a clip

1425
01:44:14,986 --> 01:44:17,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it won last week, so you already know what it sounds like.

1426
01:44:17,048 --> 01:44:18,349
[SPEAKER_05]: A clip of Larkin Seal.

1427
01:44:18,409 --> 01:44:19,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Ready, steady, go.

1428
01:44:44,008 --> 01:44:53,893
Kato wa kirenai kizu kakaekonde ite mo Chotto ya soto ja tamashii made wa ubawasenai Aoka no nukou de kimi ni deaeta nara Nani kara hanasou

1429
01:45:15,129 --> 01:45:15,669
Hey, everybody

1430
01:45:56,264 --> 01:45:58,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, that was song number one in tonight's Cage Match.

1431
01:45:58,985 --> 01:46:06,848
[SPEAKER_05]: The chatroom choice, which I'm stepping aside for, is that that song can continue to stay in Cage Match until it gets voted out.

1432
01:46:07,288 --> 01:46:09,529
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Larkin Seal with Ready Steady Go.

1433
01:46:09,609 --> 01:46:13,990
[SPEAKER_05]: And so let's get into tonight's two challengers that will be battling that song.

1434
01:46:14,971 --> 01:46:17,311
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I just have to make one comment since I wasn't here last week.

1435
01:46:17,371 --> 01:46:17,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1436
01:46:18,432 --> 01:46:20,473
[SPEAKER_18]: I do really like Larkin Seal.

1437
01:46:21,573 --> 01:46:24,274
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't like that as the opening theme for SMA.

1438
01:46:25,814 --> 01:46:26,975
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1439
01:46:53,996 --> 01:46:56,756
[SPEAKER_05]: So, chat room did okay on that one, so I'm not going to complain.

1440
01:46:57,037 --> 01:46:57,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1441
01:46:58,297 --> 01:46:58,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we go.

1442
01:46:58,977 --> 01:47:01,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Song number two tonight is going to come to us from Loki.

1443
01:47:01,877 --> 01:47:03,298
[SPEAKER_05]: And, Loki, what are you picking tonight?

1444
01:47:04,538 --> 01:47:07,218
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm picking a... First, I found the remix album.

1445
01:47:07,258 --> 01:47:09,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I found the original CD.

1446
01:47:09,299 --> 01:47:22,781
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is from a group that's calling themselves ProdigyRemix.com And it's actually a group of about four different remixers that completely remixed the brand new album from Prodigy, which is

1447
01:47:23,911 --> 01:47:25,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Always Outnumbered and Never Outgunned

1448
01:53:07,705 --> 01:53:12,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I just want to preface, before we judge the song, I want to preface with this.

1449
01:53:12,646 --> 01:53:15,887
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been doing the cage match for about two years now.

1450
01:53:16,707 --> 01:53:20,027
[SPEAKER_05]: I have been waiting that entire two years for a moment like this.

1451
01:53:21,788 --> 01:53:25,168
[SPEAKER_06]: That being said, Jamie, what did you think of that?

1452
01:53:26,228 --> 01:53:27,109
[SPEAKER_21]: It stopped!

1453
01:53:28,469 --> 01:53:29,069
[SPEAKER_21]: Zero!

1454
01:53:31,149 --> 01:53:32,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Islander, negative two.

1455
01:53:33,630 --> 01:53:35,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Jazz, girl.

1456
01:53:37,606 --> 01:53:38,366
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't like girls.

1457
01:53:39,267 --> 01:53:39,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Zero.

1458
01:53:42,069 --> 01:53:42,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Guana Girl.

1459
01:53:44,451 --> 01:53:46,493
[SPEAKER_21]: That was something from Prodigy?

1460
01:53:52,478 --> 01:53:54,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I was waiting for a number, I'm sorry.

1461
01:53:55,541 --> 01:53:55,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Zero.

1462
01:53:56,181 --> 01:53:56,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

1463
01:53:57,662 --> 01:53:58,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki!

1464
01:53:59,984 --> 01:54:00,365
[SPEAKER_07]: You know...

1465
01:54:01,528 --> 01:54:05,251
[SPEAKER_07]: What's sad is that this remix version was better than the original.

1466
01:54:06,051 --> 01:54:07,592
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the worst part of it.

1467
01:54:08,413 --> 01:54:08,873
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1468
01:54:09,193 --> 01:54:10,774
[SPEAKER_07]: I just picked this song because I had nothing else.

1469
01:54:11,134 --> 01:54:13,216
[SPEAKER_07]: And next week is when I'll have the good song.

1470
01:54:13,476 --> 01:54:14,937
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I was trying to download.

1471
01:54:15,537 --> 01:54:19,240
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, I just found it too late.

1472
01:54:19,260 --> 01:54:20,180
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it's alright.

1473
01:54:20,941 --> 01:54:22,822
[SPEAKER_07]: But I give it a zero just to go with everyone else.

1474
01:54:27,045 --> 01:54:27,585
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1475
01:54:28,931 --> 01:54:35,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, after all the shitty songs I've put in the cage match, because there's been a few, I'm really glad that it's not just me.

1476
01:54:35,873 --> 01:54:36,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Zero.

1477
01:54:36,993 --> 01:54:37,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Angel?

1478
01:54:39,034 --> 01:54:40,454
[SPEAKER_19]: Negative 999, that's all.

1479
01:54:40,995 --> 01:54:42,955
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh my god, she didn't do something nice.

1480
01:54:44,156 --> 01:54:47,076
[SPEAKER_18]: Holy crap, you've given the 10 to some really bad stuff.

1481
01:54:51,298 --> 01:54:54,999
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I'm not meaning this in a mean way, but I'm surprised.

1482
01:54:58,420 --> 01:54:58,720
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1483
01:55:01,416 --> 01:55:08,140
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll remind you though, your singing actually did get voted in for the weekly pick.

1484
01:55:09,040 --> 01:55:11,682
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I think your singing is better than girls.

1485
01:55:11,862 --> 01:55:13,042
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to point this out.

1486
01:55:13,063 --> 01:55:15,424
[SPEAKER_20]: Girls, girls, girls, girls.

1487
01:55:16,164 --> 01:55:17,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki now can attest to this.

1488
01:55:18,225 --> 01:55:26,990
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the first time a song has ever been put in the cage match and gotten zeros from every single judge, including the one who put it in.

1489
01:55:30,146 --> 01:55:33,347
[SPEAKER_18]: We have our show's history tonight.

1490
01:55:33,467 --> 01:55:39,069
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we've had one where I put it in and everybody else gave it a zero, but I gave it a hundred to balance it out.

1491
01:55:39,669 --> 01:55:41,870
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember what song it was, but I know I've been there.

1492
01:55:42,490 --> 01:55:43,571
[SPEAKER_05]: But remember, you know what?

1493
01:55:43,991 --> 01:55:45,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Our opinion sucks.

1494
01:55:45,692 --> 01:55:48,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Will the chat room vote it in just to be funny?

1495
01:55:48,292 --> 01:55:49,913
[SPEAKER_05]: And let me tell you, that would not be funny.

1496
01:55:51,013 --> 01:55:53,014
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll find out because it's really up to the chat room.

1497
01:55:54,269 --> 01:55:55,009
[SPEAKER_20]: Jamie... Jamie...

1498
01:56:18,638 --> 01:56:30,466
[SPEAKER_18]: I forgot who it is that did this again, but there was a song, and I think, I really do think that this is one that I had on a tape that I bought at the Limited back when I was in my senior year of high school, taking French.

1499
01:56:30,926 --> 01:56:33,028
[SPEAKER_18]: And I bought the tape because it was all in French.

1500
01:56:33,048 --> 01:56:36,610
[SPEAKER_18]: I was like, oh, cool, I can use it to, you know, practice.

1501
01:56:37,511 --> 01:56:40,713
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a song called Jolitaxi that I really liked.

1502
01:56:40,833 --> 01:56:47,878
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, it was a cute song, and I was looking for it and found a remix of it, and this has actually been sort of edging me back into trance, believe it or not.

1503
01:56:48,479 --> 01:56:51,261
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is a trance mix of Jolitaxi.

1504
01:56:51,841 --> 01:56:55,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, now the full name of this is huge, so I'm only going to read it once, kids.

1505
01:56:55,304 --> 01:56:55,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Here it is.

1506
01:56:56,165 --> 01:57:03,450
[SPEAKER_05]: The artist, Aria Posey, and the song, Jolitaxi, and it's the Jan Wayne remix radio cut.

1507
01:57:04,851 --> 01:57:05,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay?

1508
01:57:05,671 --> 01:57:06,512
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow, that's pretty damn long.

1509
01:57:06,572 --> 01:57:07,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, here it is.

1510
01:57:07,773 --> 01:57:08,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Song number three.

1511
01:57:08,433 --> 01:57:08,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy.

1512
01:57:11,336 --> 01:57:12,897
[SPEAKER_11]: Jolitaxi Jolitaxi

1513
01:57:19,470 --> 01:57:34,024
[SPEAKER_11]: In your yellow castle, you know all the streets by heart In your quest, the goal is four days It's the game, the game, the game, the game

1514
01:59:28,280 --> 01:59:31,745
Sake, La Musica Jo, C'est La Rumba, Le Duroc au Mambo

1515
02:00:48,152 --> 02:00:50,894
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's see what everybody thought about song number three.

1516
02:00:50,954 --> 02:00:53,356
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll just call it Joe LaTaxi for short.

1517
02:00:53,977 --> 02:00:54,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie?

1518
02:00:55,178 --> 02:00:57,279
[SPEAKER_18]: I've just been listening to that song on repeat.

1519
02:00:57,480 --> 02:01:04,085
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, actually, it was... I was listening to it earlier today just trying to keep myself in a good mood, and I give it a nine.

1520
02:01:04,406 --> 02:01:04,646
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean...

1521
02:01:05,351 --> 02:01:06,932
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm still not quite in my trance minute.

1522
02:01:06,952 --> 02:01:13,434
[SPEAKER_18]: It does have a couple of slightly overly trance-y annoying things in it, but overall it's such a good song and I like the original.

1523
02:01:14,495 --> 02:01:15,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you want to get your thought in before you head off?

1524
02:01:15,975 --> 02:01:17,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, alright.

1525
02:01:17,216 --> 02:01:17,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Jazz?

1526
02:01:18,456 --> 02:01:19,437
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was okay.

1527
02:01:20,077 --> 02:01:24,759
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems very kind of J-trance-y to me, like something Ayumi would do a lot to me.

1528
02:01:25,319 --> 02:01:30,361
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's okay, but I don't know, it got a little too trance-y for me, just generic trance-y for me.

1529
02:01:30,401 --> 02:01:31,942
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was still good, so I'd give it like a 7.

1530
02:01:33,022 --> 02:01:33,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1531
02:01:33,983 --> 02:01:34,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Islander?

1532
02:01:35,407 --> 02:01:37,568
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, that was actually the same score I was going to give it myself.

1533
02:01:38,369 --> 02:01:41,690
[SPEAKER_22]: I did like it a lot, and I liked it a lot better than some of the other stuff that was played.

1534
02:01:43,652 --> 02:01:45,372
[SPEAKER_22]: That being said, yes, a good solid 7.

1535
02:01:45,412 --> 02:01:48,574
[SPEAKER_22]: That sounds very good.

1536
02:01:49,034 --> 02:01:52,496
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that song was kind of odd, but it was odd in a good way.

1537
02:01:52,616 --> 02:01:55,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it was kind of one of those songs I just go, huh, that's kind of neat.

1538
02:01:56,739 --> 02:01:59,980
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and honestly, this week it better win, so I give it a 9.

1539
02:02:02,728 --> 02:02:03,028
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it.

1540
02:02:03,048 --> 02:02:03,509
[SPEAKER_07]: It's bouncy.

1541
02:02:03,609 --> 02:02:03,869
[SPEAKER_07]: It's happy.

1542
02:02:03,909 --> 02:02:04,109
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an 8.

1543
02:02:19,275 --> 02:02:23,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, you've heard what we have to say, now let's hear what you have to say.

1544
02:02:23,157 --> 02:02:28,500
[SPEAKER_05]: You will pick the winner by placing your vote right after this recap of the three songs you can vote for tonight.

1545
02:02:28,580 --> 02:02:31,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Song number one, Larkin Seal, Ready Steady Go.

[SPEAKER_05]: Girls.

1550

[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1551
02:03:03,976 --> 02:03:05,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki's crying foul.

1552
02:03:05,756 --> 02:03:06,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki's crying foul.

1553
02:03:06,816 --> 02:03:08,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a little bit longer.

1554
02:03:14,058 --> 02:03:14,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Girls.

1555
02:03:14,598 --> 02:03:15,219
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, there it is.

1556
02:03:15,419 --> 02:03:15,739
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1557
02:03:17,895 --> 02:03:18,795
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what I'm going to do.

1558
02:03:18,815 --> 02:03:19,775
[SPEAKER_05]: I might change my F.U.

1559
02:03:19,795 --> 02:03:20,416
[SPEAKER_05]: music to that.

1560
02:03:20,436 --> 02:03:21,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, fine.

1561
02:03:47,601 --> 02:03:48,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Place your vote now, guys.

1562
02:03:49,262 --> 02:03:57,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully somebody will remind you there in the chat room how you can place your vote if you haven't done so yet.

1563
02:04:02,647 --> 02:04:02,967
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1564
02:04:03,948 --> 02:04:04,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

1565
02:04:05,788 --> 02:04:10,350
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to take a call on the Skype line, but I'm going to hold off on that for just a minute because I just remembered something.

1566
02:04:10,370 --> 02:04:12,851
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, oh yeah, let's wait on it for a minute.

1567
02:04:12,951 --> 02:04:15,812
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll do that Skype line thing in a little bit.

1568
02:04:15,832 --> 02:04:18,352
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to go to a quick break, I think, and then come back.

1569
02:04:19,093 --> 02:04:26,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Before we go to the break, though, I thought I'd scan around, see if there's any big news going on here we should talk about.

1570
02:04:28,616 --> 02:04:29,957
[SPEAKER_05]: What about the, oh yeah, tell me about this.

1571
02:04:29,997 --> 02:04:32,037
[SPEAKER_05]: This is another game I got to play for the first time this week.

1572
02:04:32,097 --> 02:04:32,918
[SPEAKER_05]: The Guy Game.

1573
02:04:32,958 --> 02:04:33,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell us about what's going on there.

1574
02:04:34,637 --> 02:04:34,837
[SPEAKER_22]: Lovely.

1575
02:04:34,877 --> 02:04:35,698
[SPEAKER_22]: Lovely, lovely, lovely.

1576
02:05:04,329 --> 02:05:06,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Dun, dun, dun.

1577
02:05:07,210 --> 02:05:08,571
[SPEAKER_22]: So now the game's getting recalled.

1578
02:05:08,631 --> 02:05:08,991
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, yeah.

1579
02:05:09,031 --> 02:05:11,072
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's being yanked off store shelves with the quickness.

1580
02:05:12,432 --> 02:05:18,474
[SPEAKER_22]: I was able to snag an Xbox copy for my cousin for Christmas, and I told him, if you ever sell this thing, I will fucking kill you.

1581
02:05:19,455 --> 02:05:21,776
[SPEAKER_22]: You could eBay this probably in about a year for some big cash.

1582
02:05:21,796 --> 02:05:22,116
[SPEAKER_22]: Who knows?

1583
02:05:22,516 --> 02:05:22,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

1584
02:05:22,956 --> 02:05:23,857
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a collector's item now.

1585
02:05:24,117 --> 02:05:26,157
[SPEAKER_05]: It's right up there with, like, Custer's Revenge now at this point.

1586
02:05:26,358 --> 02:05:26,658
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, yeah.

1587
02:05:26,698 --> 02:05:27,078
[SPEAKER_22]: Seriously.

1588
02:05:27,338 --> 02:05:27,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

1589
02:05:27,938 --> 02:05:28,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.

1590
02:05:28,919 --> 02:05:29,239
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1591
02:05:29,939 --> 02:05:30,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1592
02:05:31,343 --> 02:05:34,045
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to go to a break now.

1593
02:05:34,065 --> 02:05:38,727
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we come back from this break, we'll go to the Skype line and we'll hear who won tonight's cage match.

1594
02:05:39,348 --> 02:05:41,269
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to get into the FUs of the week.

1595
02:05:42,690 --> 02:05:43,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Busy show still ahead.

1596
02:05:44,131 --> 02:05:45,151
[SPEAKER_05]: So don't go anywhere.

1597
02:05:45,211 --> 02:05:46,892
[SPEAKER_05]: We will be back after this break.

1598
02:05:46,912 --> 02:05:49,674
[SPEAKER_05]: And I haven't even really thought about what kind of theme we should do this break.

1599
02:05:49,754 --> 02:05:53,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe... No, we're not going to play girls again.

1600
02:05:56,141 --> 02:05:57,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's play... I don't know.

1601
02:05:57,403 --> 02:05:59,485
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to play a song we don't usually play.

1602
02:05:59,906 --> 02:06:01,588
[SPEAKER_05]: How about some Beatmania 5-key stuff?

1603
02:06:01,628 --> 02:06:02,929
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't heard some 5-key stuff in a while.

1604
02:06:03,210 --> 02:06:04,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's something from Beatmania Final.

1605
02:06:04,872 --> 02:06:05,773
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Fellows.

1606
02:06:05,993 --> 02:06:07,115
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back after this.

1607
02:06:47,563 --> 02:06:48,905
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

1608
02:07:52,453 --> 02:08:05,523
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma

1609
02:08:20,785 --> 02:08:21,866
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

1610
02:08:49,532 --> 02:08:51,634
Thank you for watching!

1611
02:11:03,166 --> 02:11:03,786
and many more.

1612
02:11:57,254 --> 02:11:58,634
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

1613
02:12:28,001 --> 02:12:33,765
[SPEAKER_16]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

1614
02:12:38,147 --> 02:12:42,970
[SPEAKER_05]: We are back here at Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 125.

[SPEAKER_05]: And let's find out who won tonight's cage match.

1616
02:12:45,992 --> 02:12:47,853
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you boys and girls are really excited.

[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's find out.

[SPEAKER_05]: By one vote, this song won.

[SPEAKER_05]: I can't say, I'm sworn to secrecy.

1620

[SPEAKER_05]: One vote over song number two.

1621
02:13:31,226 --> 02:13:32,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Some folks trying to be funny.

1622
02:13:32,187 --> 02:13:33,929
[SPEAKER_18]: The chat room is full of fun cards.

1623
02:13:33,949 --> 02:13:35,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Song number one, not forgotten about.

1624
02:13:36,071 --> 02:13:40,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Not forgotten about by any means, but a little bit left in the dust there with the rest of the controversy.

1625
02:13:40,555 --> 02:13:41,556
[SPEAKER_05]: So, sorry guys.

1626
02:13:42,257 --> 02:13:47,162
[SPEAKER_05]: But maybe we'll do the chat room choice again sometime at a later date.

1627
02:13:47,302 --> 02:13:47,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Girls.

1628
02:13:49,404 --> 02:13:49,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Girls.

1629
02:13:51,406 --> 02:13:51,686
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1630
02:13:54,901 --> 02:14:16,696
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what we're going to do is we're going to go to the Skype line in a minute here We're going to do that and also we're going to be doing the FUs of the week momentarily So send those FUs over to Sky via private message and we'll take those In the meantime, let's go to the Skype line Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio Is this me?

02:14:29,395 --> 02:14:30,115
[SPEAKER_20]: Aren't you always?

1637
02:14:31,636 --> 02:14:33,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, when I think of you, yes.

1638
02:14:35,117 --> 02:14:37,338
[SPEAKER_04]: And the minute I hear Rob's voice, it shrinks up.

1639
02:14:38,818 --> 02:14:40,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell him who you are, asshole.

1640
02:14:41,779 --> 02:14:42,680
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the asshole.

1641
02:14:45,161 --> 02:14:46,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you want to be my friend?

1642
02:14:46,441 --> 02:14:49,162
[SPEAKER_21]: Asshole formerly known as the asshole of the dance.

1643
02:14:51,024 --> 02:14:52,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't make me come back there.

1644
02:14:54,446 --> 02:14:58,868
[SPEAKER_05]: The one and only and never replaceable asshole.

1645
02:15:01,350 --> 02:15:04,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, come on, say it, say it.

1646
02:15:05,011 --> 02:15:11,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Travis from UnderSedationLive.org Oh, you like that, don't you?

1647
02:15:11,235 --> 02:15:11,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1648
02:15:12,155 --> 02:15:13,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you like that bitch, don't you, huh?

1649
02:15:14,611 --> 02:15:15,652
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you want, Travis?

1650
02:15:15,672 --> 02:15:17,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you just call in to taunt us?

1651
02:15:18,093 --> 02:15:20,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually, I had a rant, but I'm going to get to that in a second.

1652
02:15:20,795 --> 02:15:21,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1653
02:15:21,115 --> 02:15:24,637
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys were talking about, obviously, you had an annoying song on earlier.

1654
02:15:24,817 --> 02:15:25,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we did.

1655
02:15:25,338 --> 02:15:28,439
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it was something that was catastrophically annoying.

1656
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:29,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it was.

1657
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:31,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I found something worse.

1658
02:15:31,441 --> 02:15:31,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1659
02:15:31,761 --> 02:15:35,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't this annoying?

1660
02:15:36,885 --> 02:15:37,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1661
02:15:43,337 --> 02:15:44,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like a game, doesn't it?

1662
02:15:44,738 --> 02:15:45,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1663
02:15:46,218 --> 02:15:46,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you even hear it?

1664
02:15:47,579 --> 02:15:48,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I can.

1665
02:15:48,079 --> 02:15:48,439
[SPEAKER_05]: I can hear it.

1666
02:15:48,759 --> 02:15:48,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

1667
02:15:53,321 --> 02:15:53,941
[SPEAKER_04]: That's worse.

1668
02:15:54,702 --> 02:15:55,322
[SPEAKER_04]: What is that?

1669
02:15:56,102 --> 02:15:58,203
[SPEAKER_04]: That's from The Life Aquatic.

1670
02:16:00,564 --> 02:16:02,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so that's the trailer in the movie The Life Aquatic?

1671
02:16:03,145 --> 02:16:05,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's from the movie The Life Aquatic.

1672
02:16:05,286 --> 02:16:07,647
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that supposed to be going under the sea music?

1673
02:16:08,187 --> 02:16:08,467
[SPEAKER_04]: That is.

1674
02:16:08,487 --> 02:16:09,668
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going under the sea music.

1675
02:16:10,939 --> 02:16:13,061
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the music that's playing in Bill Murray's helmet.

1676
02:16:13,921 --> 02:16:14,862
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of funky.

1677
02:16:14,882 --> 02:16:16,823
[SPEAKER_18]: That's right, that was on the trailer.

1678
02:16:17,364 --> 02:16:19,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and he starts doing that little butt shake.

1679
02:16:19,926 --> 02:16:20,986
[SPEAKER_18]: I need to see that movie.

1680
02:16:21,127 --> 02:16:24,509
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, I don't know, the girl's song, not funky.

1681
02:16:24,609 --> 02:16:25,550
[SPEAKER_05]: That song, funky.

1682
02:16:25,810 --> 02:16:26,150
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1683
02:16:26,190 --> 02:16:27,171
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, that one's kind of groovy.

1684
02:16:28,072 --> 02:16:28,692
[SPEAKER_18]: If annoying.

1685
02:16:29,433 --> 02:16:32,555
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm amazed Rod didn't play this when that song was on.

1686
02:16:33,075 --> 02:16:36,398
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, and I have an opinion on this show, they are losers.

1687
02:16:38,816 --> 02:16:41,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, your man is back in what, two weeks, three weeks?

1688
02:16:42,039 --> 02:16:43,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Simon, my idol, yes, he's back.

1689
02:16:45,701 --> 02:16:47,563
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually going to try and watch American Idol this year.

1690
02:16:48,383 --> 02:16:49,304
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't watch it last year.

1691
02:16:50,805 --> 02:16:53,167
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do, I have an FU.

1692
02:16:53,487 --> 02:16:58,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, we're going to be getting into that soon, so why not give us a preemptive FU here?

1693
02:16:59,871 --> 02:17:01,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, a preemptive FU?

1694
02:17:01,072 --> 02:17:07,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever, a pre, pre, pre, I don't know, fine, we'll call it a foreplay FU, how's that?

1695
02:17:08,888 --> 02:17:10,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well let me transition.

1696
02:17:10,609 --> 02:17:10,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1697
02:17:13,171 --> 02:17:13,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1698
02:17:14,312 --> 02:17:17,694
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to transition into FU mode.

1699
02:17:17,794 --> 02:17:21,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you're like the only outlet I can go to when it comes to video games, is you guys.

1700
02:17:22,217 --> 02:17:23,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's what we're here for, okay.

1701
02:17:24,499 --> 02:17:30,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so I thought I'd get this out in my, you know, out in the open now.

1702
02:17:30,623 --> 02:17:34,145
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm fucking, can I say that on this show?

1703
02:17:34,245 --> 02:17:35,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you fucking can.

1704
02:17:35,686 --> 02:17:36,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thank you fucking much.

1705
02:17:38,064 --> 02:17:45,270
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sick and fucking tired of all these jack-ons on Halo 2 who are fucking cheating out the ass with standbys on their cable modems.

1706
02:17:46,471 --> 02:17:47,932
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you cheat in Halo 2?

1707
02:17:48,873 --> 02:17:54,598
[SPEAKER_04]: You put your cable modem on standby in multiplayer games like Capture the Flag, Assault, and all that shit.

1708
02:17:55,842 --> 02:18:00,047
[SPEAKER_04]: So while everyone else goes into reconnection oblivion, you're still playing your game.

1709
02:18:00,387 --> 02:18:09,137
[SPEAKER_04]: You got the bomb, you got the flag, you go right to the goal point, set the bomb off or capture the flag, take your modem out of standby, and boom, you've suddenly got a point.

1710
02:18:09,737 --> 02:18:10,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Genius.

1711
02:18:12,526 --> 02:18:14,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for telling all our listeners how to cheat at Halo.

1712
02:18:14,907 --> 02:18:17,088
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure they're all going to go do it right now.

1713
02:18:17,148 --> 02:18:26,811
[SPEAKER_04]: What everybody needs to do is go to Bungie.net, the people behind Halo 2, get on their forum boards, report people that do this shit, and get these people banned off Xbox Live.

1714
02:18:26,931 --> 02:18:31,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Notice also, Graves, those people that mod their controllers for burst firing in Halo 2.

1715
02:18:32,533 --> 02:18:33,413
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen that also.

1716
02:18:33,473 --> 02:18:34,714
[SPEAKER_07]: That's ridiculous.

1717
02:18:35,414 --> 02:18:36,114
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not cheating.

1718
02:18:36,354 --> 02:18:37,815
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just competitive play.

1719
02:18:40,049 --> 02:18:40,549
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

1720
02:18:40,629 --> 02:18:41,610
[SPEAKER_21]: Meaning that Travis does it.

1721
02:18:42,030 --> 02:18:43,370
[SPEAKER_04]: I see, okay.

1722
02:18:43,390 --> 02:18:45,551
[SPEAKER_04]: That's called taking advantage of the scenario.

1723
02:18:46,632 --> 02:18:48,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like grabbing the flag through the wall.

1724
02:18:48,672 --> 02:18:49,693
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fun as hell.

1725
02:18:51,874 --> 02:18:55,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it true that Bungie erased everybody's data sometime in the past couple days?

1726
02:18:55,495 --> 02:18:57,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Like all the Rumble Slayer stuff went bye-bye?

1727
02:18:58,336 --> 02:18:58,856
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard this.

1728
02:18:59,237 --> 02:19:02,358
[SPEAKER_04]: If they haven't already done it, they are in the process of doing this.

1729
02:19:02,378 --> 02:19:05,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I've talked to a couple people in the community and...

1730
02:19:05,848 --> 02:19:21,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Bungie, they're even trying to find a way to work around the standby mode and all of us who play Halo 2 Online thought that was the neatest thing in the world was when your game goes into lag and you disconnect you don't lose the game entirely you just pick up where you left off everything's fine and you just keep on playing

1731
02:19:22,202 --> 02:19:37,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, unfortunately, these little, you know, 14-year-old asswipes who, you know, get off on gushing on pictures of Lindsay Lohan in Entertainment Weekly, who have no life but drinking Yahoo and eating Ding Dongs, have found this little loophole through their cable modems.

1732
02:19:38,976 --> 02:19:48,745
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know... These, by the way, being the same 14-year-olds that get on Xbox Live and while you're playing them go, Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga!

1733
02:19:49,446 --> 02:19:51,188
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're as white as you, Rob.

1734
02:19:51,968 --> 02:19:52,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly, they are.

1735
02:19:52,929 --> 02:19:54,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Whiter, in fact, if you can believe it.

1736
02:19:54,411 --> 02:19:55,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and you can hear it in their voice.

1737
02:19:55,952 --> 02:20:07,382
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's funny is when I'm playing with one of my friends, who happens to be a man of color, listening to him crack up, listening to these guys go, Oh, you nigga this, you nigga, oh, I got you, nigga.

1738
02:20:07,723 --> 02:20:13,688
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and he just, he takes great pride and pleasure in coming behind them during the game and just beating them down.

1739
02:20:14,963 --> 02:20:15,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Jack Black, NotFunny

1740
02:20:39,186 --> 02:21:08,165
[SPEAKER_20]: stuff like that I mean, us white people, we got Jack Black and unfortunately, the African American community has Dave Chappelle alright wait, wait, wait hang on you have to go back a little bit with the Jack Black stuff and you have to go back to Mr. Show he ruined every episode he was in no way, no way, I'm sorry don't put your dick in these holes that's classic

1741
02:21:08,786 --> 02:21:10,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeepers Creepers, he ruined that one.

1742
02:21:11,828 --> 02:21:13,489
[SPEAKER_04]: He ruined the farmer bit.

1743
02:21:14,449 --> 02:21:14,809
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1744
02:21:15,350 --> 02:21:16,410
[SPEAKER_04]: He's ruined all the shit.

1745
02:21:16,450 --> 02:21:17,751
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I don't like him.

1746
02:21:18,391 --> 02:21:18,972
[SPEAKER_04]: I hated him.

1747
02:21:19,392 --> 02:21:23,835
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't stand Tenacious D. Have you even bothered to see School of Rock?

1748
02:21:24,495 --> 02:21:25,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I have.

1749
02:21:25,275 --> 02:21:30,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, my place has a habit of showing it multiple times on the electronics section.

1750
02:21:31,019 --> 02:21:34,561
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I unfortunately am cursed with seeing that movie.

1751
02:21:36,122 --> 02:21:38,603
[SPEAKER_04]: So, how are you doing, Jeff?

1752
02:21:39,693 --> 02:21:40,273
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm in pain.

1753
02:21:40,893 --> 02:21:41,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

1754
02:21:41,094 --> 02:21:42,554
[SPEAKER_04]: What's wrong, hun?

1755
02:21:42,714 --> 02:21:44,455
[SPEAKER_20]: My left side hurts for no apparent reason.

1756
02:21:44,875 --> 02:21:46,775
[SPEAKER_20]: And it has been since, like, Friday.

1757
02:21:48,616 --> 02:21:51,297
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm trying to determine if it's because of working out too much or not.

1758
02:21:52,457 --> 02:21:54,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what it could be.

1759
02:21:55,658 --> 02:21:56,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that I think about it.

1760
02:21:56,499 --> 02:21:57,399
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not pregnant.

1761
02:21:57,919 --> 02:21:58,920
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

1762
02:21:58,980 --> 02:22:00,000
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't have AIDS.

1763
02:22:01,120 --> 02:22:01,981
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be a tumor.

1764
02:22:02,881 --> 02:22:04,121
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not a tumor.

1765
02:22:04,141 --> 02:22:05,122
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not a tumor.

1766
02:22:05,322 --> 02:22:05,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1767
02:22:05,562 --> 02:22:05,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1768
02:22:09,315 --> 02:22:09,876
[SPEAKER_04]: I could play.

1769
02:22:10,916 --> 02:22:12,237
[SPEAKER_05]: I envy your soundboard.

1770
02:22:12,297 --> 02:22:12,937
[SPEAKER_05]: What can I say?

1771
02:22:12,997 --> 02:22:15,278
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have anything that fancy.

1772
02:22:15,398 --> 02:22:19,701
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why I came up with the other idea, which I'm emailing you all.

1773
02:22:19,861 --> 02:22:24,563
[SPEAKER_04]: I've set a date tentatively, and I hope you all are capable of participating.

1774
02:22:24,583 --> 02:22:25,624
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to pencil it in.

1775
02:22:26,464 --> 02:22:26,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1776
02:22:27,144 --> 02:22:29,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Just pencil in the 29th of January.

1777
02:22:29,806 --> 02:22:31,947
[SPEAKER_20]: Wow, that happens to be my birthday weekend.

1778
02:22:32,327 --> 02:22:33,048
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi.

1779
02:22:33,788 --> 02:22:36,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Good planning on my part, huh?

1780
02:22:36,509 --> 02:22:37,790
[SPEAKER_20]: Potentially bad, but we'll see.

1781
02:22:39,651 --> 02:22:40,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I see.

1782
02:22:40,372 --> 02:22:41,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Your birthday's more important.

1783
02:22:41,352 --> 02:22:41,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1784
02:22:41,512 --> 02:22:44,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'll remember that.

1785
02:22:44,514 --> 02:22:50,718
[SPEAKER_20]: At least, you know, I'm only turning 28, you old fart, but it's still important.

1786
02:22:56,022 --> 02:22:59,264
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Travis just shot himself, ladies and gentlemen, live on air.

1787
02:22:59,724 --> 02:23:00,004
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1788
02:23:00,565 --> 02:23:01,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, darn.

1789
02:23:01,505 --> 02:23:04,728
[SPEAKER_04]: No, have you even told... No, it's just Texas.

1790
02:23:04,748 --> 02:23:06,389
[SPEAKER_20]: You get all sorts of gun noises out there.

1791
02:23:06,589 --> 02:23:06,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

1792
02:23:08,127 --> 02:23:09,768
[SPEAKER_04]: You forget, we live in shit-kicking Texas.

1793
02:23:12,189 --> 02:23:13,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Have we even told them what?

1794
02:23:14,690 --> 02:23:17,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, I know Jess knows, I know you know, I know Jamie knows.

1795
02:23:17,972 --> 02:23:20,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody else around knows about the little thing?

1796
02:23:21,674 --> 02:23:25,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I... Angel says yes, she does.

1797
02:23:26,196 --> 02:23:26,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, alright.

1798
02:23:27,356 --> 02:23:29,617
[SPEAKER_20]: And Ross knows, but he doesn't realize he knows.

1799
02:23:29,677 --> 02:23:30,598
[SPEAKER_05]: People know, they know.

1800
02:23:30,678 --> 02:23:30,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway...

1801
02:23:32,133 --> 02:23:36,837
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to steer too off track here, but I do want to say some folks in the chat room think you're pretty funny, Travis.

1802
02:23:37,217 --> 02:23:38,899
[SPEAKER_05]: You have some fans in the chat room already.

1803
02:23:40,480 --> 02:23:41,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.

1804
02:23:42,341 --> 02:23:43,522
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I said when I read it.

1805
02:23:45,123 --> 02:23:48,546
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys think Travis is funny, then you know what?

1806
02:23:49,056 --> 02:23:50,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Scream me along!

1807
02:23:53,819 --> 02:23:55,361
[SPEAKER_05]: You can listen to Travis' show.

1808
02:23:55,421 --> 02:23:56,521
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Under Sedation Live.

1809
02:23:57,522 --> 02:24:05,308
[SPEAKER_05]: www.undersedationlive.org It's where Iguana Girl and I got our start on the internet radio and DarkSakura to some extent as well.

1810
02:24:05,748 --> 02:24:07,689
[SPEAKER_18]: I was the number one most often guest.

1811
02:24:07,749 --> 02:24:08,250
[SPEAKER_18]: I know you were.

1812
02:24:08,410 --> 02:24:08,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1813
02:24:08,650 --> 02:24:09,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Rob.

1814
02:24:09,170 --> 02:24:09,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1815
02:24:10,952 --> 02:24:11,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I just got one thing to say.

1816
02:24:12,993 --> 02:24:15,255
[SPEAKER_09]: You really think you can do all that bullshit you just said?

1817
02:24:18,671 --> 02:24:19,891
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just trying to help you out, buddy.

1818
02:24:21,472 --> 02:24:22,432
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell are you doing?

1819
02:24:22,752 --> 02:24:24,432
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a weird echo.

1820
02:24:24,592 --> 02:24:24,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Go.

1821
02:24:26,612 --> 02:24:27,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop that.

1822
02:24:29,073 --> 02:24:30,093
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hanging up on you.

1823
02:24:30,333 --> 02:24:30,893
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you're not.

1824
02:24:31,093 --> 02:24:34,674
[SPEAKER_11]: Use the force.

1825
02:24:35,874 --> 02:24:38,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you honestly want to get into that type of war with me?

1826
02:24:39,675 --> 02:24:40,615
[SPEAKER_04]: You know you'll lose.

1827
02:24:43,675 --> 02:24:45,376
[SPEAKER_20]: You're going to be in the process, too.

1828
02:24:45,396 --> 02:24:45,636
[SPEAKER_20]: What?

1829
02:24:48,154 --> 02:24:49,895
[SPEAKER_20]: You're being in the front.

1830
02:24:49,915 --> 02:24:51,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Turn your goddamn echo thing off.

1831
02:24:53,616 --> 02:24:54,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Rob.

1832
02:24:54,617 --> 02:24:54,897
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1833
02:24:59,639 --> 02:25:01,039
[SPEAKER_04]: I can make everybody sound like chipmunks.

1834
02:25:02,700 --> 02:25:03,820
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate you.

1835
02:25:04,121 --> 02:25:09,023
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I can do 3D effects.

1836
02:25:11,163 --> 02:25:17,266
[SPEAKER_04]: See, this is what happens when I waste my money on toys that I don't need instead of, you know, getting stuff that my daughter really needs, like diapers.

1837
02:25:18,284 --> 02:25:20,387
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of hard wrapping her up in brown paper bags.

1838
02:25:22,309 --> 02:25:24,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's say Walmart on the side.

1839
02:25:26,254 --> 02:25:27,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, never mind, I won't go there.

1840
02:25:28,717 --> 02:25:30,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Anywho.

1841
02:25:31,300 --> 02:25:34,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't forget, the 29th, if that's a conflict, let me know ahead of time.

1842
02:25:34,504 --> 02:25:35,825
[SPEAKER_04]: I will attempt to reschedule.

1843
02:25:36,606 --> 02:25:37,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, okay.

1844
02:25:37,546 --> 02:25:40,687
[SPEAKER_04]: But we need to test out how it's going to work in sound.

1845
02:25:41,087 --> 02:25:45,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Our people will be in touch with your people.

1846
02:25:45,409 --> 02:25:47,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, get your people with my people?

1847
02:25:47,189 --> 02:25:47,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1848
02:25:47,769 --> 02:25:48,910
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no people.

1849
02:25:50,550 --> 02:25:51,791
[SPEAKER_20]: You have little people.

1850
02:25:55,132 --> 02:25:58,393
[SPEAKER_04]: And Rob just has people that come around him going, Ooh, Rob's cool.

1851
02:25:58,733 --> 02:25:59,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Want to touch him?

1852
02:25:59,453 --> 02:25:59,913
[SPEAKER_04]: I touched him.

1853
02:25:59,933 --> 02:26:00,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Want to touch him?

1854
02:26:00,673 --> 02:26:01,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, I touched him.

1855
02:26:03,154 --> 02:26:04,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Who hasn't touched Travis?

1856
02:26:04,835 --> 02:26:05,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Travis.

1857
02:26:06,320 --> 02:26:07,901
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell is going on on your end?

1858
02:26:07,921 --> 02:26:10,541
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like you guys are pushing some weird button.

1859
02:26:10,561 --> 02:26:12,062
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you've got the echo thing on.

1860
02:26:12,742 --> 02:26:13,342
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't.

1861
02:26:15,203 --> 02:26:16,803
[SPEAKER_04]: I turned off all my echo shit.

1862
02:26:17,503 --> 02:26:20,424
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what's going on.

1863
02:26:20,464 --> 02:26:21,345
[SPEAKER_04]: You scare me, man.

1864
02:26:21,625 --> 02:26:23,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, thanks for calling in, Travis.

1865
02:26:24,045 --> 02:26:24,946
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta go.

1866
02:26:24,986 --> 02:26:25,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Later.

1867
02:26:25,846 --> 02:26:26,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

1868
02:26:28,627 --> 02:26:29,567
[SPEAKER_05]: That was not on my end.

1869
02:26:31,580 --> 02:26:32,840
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh look, it's gone!

1870
02:26:33,480 --> 02:26:34,220
[SPEAKER_20]: Magically!

1871
02:26:34,381 --> 02:26:35,801
[SPEAKER_20]: I wonder how that happened.

1872
02:26:37,081 --> 02:26:37,581
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh no.

1873
02:26:38,261 --> 02:26:40,001
[SPEAKER_20]: I swear he does that just to piss us off.

1874
02:26:40,442 --> 02:26:40,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know.

1875
02:26:41,462 --> 02:26:46,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, again, if you thought that was funny, I don't know why, but, no, I'm kidding.

1876
02:26:46,763 --> 02:26:49,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Understationlive.org, we do love Travis, and of course Jenna.

1877
02:26:49,463 --> 02:26:50,463
[SPEAKER_05]: We love Jenna even more.

1878
02:26:50,603 --> 02:26:51,123
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, honestly.

1879
02:26:51,143 --> 02:26:52,124
[SPEAKER_18]: Because Jenna is hot.

1880
02:26:52,264 --> 02:26:53,544
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all about Jenna, really.

1881
02:26:54,044 --> 02:26:54,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Jenna is hot.

1882
02:26:55,424 --> 02:26:56,324
[SPEAKER_18]: Jenna is a hottie.

1883
02:26:56,764 --> 02:26:57,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally.

1884
02:26:57,524 --> 02:26:58,505
[SPEAKER_18]: It's all about Kira.

1885
02:26:58,765 --> 02:26:59,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1886
02:26:59,645 --> 02:27:00,585
[SPEAKER_18]: And Kira's a cutie.

1887
02:27:02,645 --> 02:27:08,888
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to find out what we were talking about there with the 29th, just head on over to understationlive.org and there'll be more information soon.

1888
02:27:09,168 --> 02:27:10,029
[SPEAKER_05]: And it involves us.

1889
02:27:10,789 --> 02:27:12,190
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you'll see.

1890
02:27:14,090 --> 02:27:14,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

1891
02:27:14,711 --> 02:27:15,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1892
02:27:15,691 --> 02:27:23,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm so glad that we get to go from that phone call into this next segment because this next segment is a good one to follow that up with and it's the FUs of the week.

1893
02:27:24,655 --> 02:27:29,117
[SPEAKER_05]: It's our chance to rant a little bit about the things that have been pissing us off today or all week long.

1894
02:27:29,598 --> 02:27:30,298
[SPEAKER_05]: And Jamie...

1895
02:27:31,053 --> 02:27:34,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is it that we have to do these FUs of the week every single week?

1896
02:27:34,775 --> 02:27:36,375
[SPEAKER_18]: Because of girls.

1897
02:27:52,182 --> 02:27:54,022
[SPEAKER_18]: My first FU of the week goes to your dryer.

1898
02:27:55,123 --> 02:27:57,564
[SPEAKER_18]: My second FU of the week goes toward the fatigue flu.

1899
02:27:59,195 --> 02:28:00,476
[SPEAKER_18]: for making me feel like crap.

1900
02:28:00,516 --> 02:28:02,917
[SPEAKER_18]: Another one goes to stress.

1901
02:28:04,999 --> 02:28:08,801
[SPEAKER_18]: SD goes to distance, money.

1902
02:28:10,142 --> 02:28:15,605
[SPEAKER_18]: But I am very glad, though, that I am getting a raise with my new job, which is probably going to go to pay for bills.

1903
02:28:16,192 --> 02:28:19,014
[SPEAKER_18]: Humongous F you goes to GameStop Incorporated.

1904
02:28:20,515 --> 02:28:26,079
[SPEAKER_18]: F you goes toward the holidays in general for screwing with my head.

1905
02:28:28,040 --> 02:28:34,064
[SPEAKER_18]: And F you goes toward stupid fuckers who drive really stupidly in the rain.

1906
02:28:34,765 --> 02:28:42,149
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, let's go... You know, it's one thing to drive five miles under the speed limit when you're, you know, in the rain.

1907
02:28:43,250 --> 02:28:44,291
[SPEAKER_18]: Five to ten speed, you know...

1908
02:28:44,881 --> 02:28:47,543
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, miles, depending on the conditions, is smart.

1909
02:28:47,563 --> 02:28:50,645
[SPEAKER_18]: 30 miles under the goddamn speed limit!

1910
02:28:50,665 --> 02:28:51,166
[SPEAKER_18]: Someone was going 20!

1911
02:28:52,827 --> 02:29:01,873
[SPEAKER_18]: And, like, unless you, you know, if your car is so bad to the point where you cannot drive in the rain, you need to either get a new car or take the damn bus.

1912
02:29:02,274 --> 02:29:02,654
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay?

1913
02:29:03,775 --> 02:29:08,258
[SPEAKER_18]: Um... It's... It was just one thing after another.

1914
02:29:08,298 --> 02:29:13,682
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm a very easily frustrated driver, though, so that could just be it, but... And another one goes toward...

1915
02:29:14,375 --> 02:29:19,137
[SPEAKER_18]: People who have 20 items when it says 15 items or less in the damn express line.

1916
02:29:20,238 --> 02:29:20,718
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I'm done.

1917
02:29:24,400 --> 02:29:29,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about that, I got a little bit of Loki's music in there because I ran into the other room for a second there to try and fix that out of the situation.

1918
02:29:29,803 --> 02:29:31,864
[SPEAKER_05]: But now we will get to Loki's FUs of the Week.

1919
02:29:31,904 --> 02:29:32,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.

1920
02:29:33,845 --> 02:29:38,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Um... Yeah, I'm... God damn it, I don't have enough cord.

1921
02:29:38,247 --> 02:29:39,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'll make this really quick because I'm cooking stuff.

1922
02:29:40,248 --> 02:29:40,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1923
02:29:41,728 --> 02:29:42,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see here.

1924
02:29:42,369 --> 02:29:43,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you, stupid drivers.

1925
02:29:43,430 --> 02:29:46,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you to the fact that I don't feel good right now.

1926
02:29:47,112 --> 02:29:48,453
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I caught someone's cold.

1927
02:29:51,456 --> 02:29:53,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you to work because they're not paying me enough so I have to get a new job.

1928
02:29:56,379 --> 02:29:57,200
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure there's some other stuff.

1929
02:29:57,240 --> 02:29:58,221
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember right now.

1930
02:29:58,241 --> 02:30:00,462
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a lot of stuff earlier, but hey, we're going to keep it short.

1931
02:30:00,823 --> 02:30:01,743
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my gift to you.

1932
02:30:03,285 --> 02:30:03,745
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1933
02:30:10,595 --> 02:30:38,244
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to give an F you to people that try to drive in the rain because it's obvious that nobody knows how to do it because whenever I get out there and I try to drive and it's been raining just nobody knows what they're doing so I just what's wrong with people what is it about rain oh my god water falling from the sky I need to start cutting more people off and driving 25 under the speed limit or 25 over the speed limit and coming up on your ass and you know refusing to pass you I hate people and I hate parking lots

1934
02:30:39,133 --> 02:30:43,155
[SPEAKER_05]: A big F you to Roseville and this place that I call Whitey Plaza.

1935
02:30:45,536 --> 02:30:47,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, damn, what a bunch of yuppies.

1936
02:30:47,477 --> 02:30:48,738
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, oh, I hate that place.

1937
02:30:48,878 --> 02:30:50,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, that's pretty much it.

1938
02:30:50,819 --> 02:30:52,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, everything's pretty good.

1939
02:30:52,980 --> 02:30:54,440
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can't really complain a whole lot.

1940
02:30:54,500 --> 02:30:55,501
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to move on.

1941
02:30:56,401 --> 02:30:59,103
[SPEAKER_05]: And going around, let's start it off with, who's got a mic over there?

1942
02:30:59,123 --> 02:30:59,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Jazz!

1943
02:31:02,259 --> 02:31:05,341
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to people who do not signal when they merge.

1944
02:31:06,242 --> 02:31:11,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy crap, I have never seen so many people do that here and try to cut you off.

1945
02:31:11,526 --> 02:31:12,587
[SPEAKER_03]: It is ridiculous.

1946
02:31:13,267 --> 02:31:13,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn.

1947
02:31:14,888 --> 02:31:20,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, F you to people who don't signal when they're making a left turn that isn't protected.

1948
02:31:21,693 --> 02:31:22,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.

1949
02:31:22,814 --> 02:31:24,775
[SPEAKER_03]: People in Milpitas do this all the time.

1950
02:31:24,835 --> 02:31:28,478
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to get out of a shopping center and it's raining, so it's hard enough to see what's going on.

1951
02:31:28,838 --> 02:31:30,980
[SPEAKER_03]: And people keep turning and turning and I...

1952
02:31:31,776 --> 02:31:57,283
[SPEAKER_03]: and I can either go straight or left and I'm assuming they can too I'm like oh my god what are they gonna do no one's signaling but oh my god they're all turning so I'm like oh no oh no and finally they all go through and they all turn and I'm like fuck you all and I'm just going my merry way uh I'll do FU to Taiken 5 because I suck at it uh yeah that's about it alright Islander

1953
02:31:58,271 --> 02:32:03,637
[SPEAKER_22]: The only FU I can think of really is FU to my car doors for not closing all the way and letting rainwater in.

1954
02:32:03,937 --> 02:32:08,142
[SPEAKER_22]: I have to keep a stack of newspapers on both seats to keep it dry.

1955
02:32:08,542 --> 02:32:09,543
[SPEAKER_22]: It's really annoying.

1956
02:32:11,385 --> 02:32:11,806
[SPEAKER_22]: I want a girl.

1957
02:32:13,492 --> 02:32:15,434
[SPEAKER_20]: F you to my side for hurting right now.

1958
02:32:16,854 --> 02:32:22,358
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know what caused it, but it's really, really, really, really annoying and it's painful and I want it to go away.

1959
02:32:22,378 --> 02:32:26,320
[SPEAKER_20]: F you to my butt muscles for tweaking out.

[SPEAKER_20]: FU to Lane Bryant for carrying Size 20 Pants That Don't Fit.

1964
02:32:48,871 --> 02:32:52,092
[SPEAKER_20]: FU to Lane Bryant for charging $52 for four bras on sale.

1965
02:32:52,152 --> 02:32:52,252
[SPEAKER_20]: And...

[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to learn to drive from you.

1977
02:34:06,302 --> 02:34:11,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Your skills may be leet, in your opinion, but your temper sucks too much for me to put up with you at times already.

1978
02:34:11,347 --> 02:34:14,310
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to put up with your shit when I have to put up with the other retards on the road.

1979
02:34:15,030 --> 02:34:15,951
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to Stepmania.

1980
02:34:16,412 --> 02:34:19,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Alpha 24 was the most recent one that actually worked for me.

1981
02:34:19,615 --> 02:34:22,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it won't load at all, and I can't find any older alphas to download.

02:34:25,014 --> 02:34:28,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Dork says, F you goes to work for cutting my hours.

1990
02:34:54,525 --> 02:34:58,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Allusion says F you to Bill O'Reilly for being a douchey blubbering vagina.

02:35:25,790 --> 02:35:27,111

[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

02:35:28,752 --> 02:35:32,935
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S says, F you to my job for fucking me over, you bastards.

2001
02:35:32,975 --> 02:35:34,096
[SPEAKER_05]: I will have my revenge.

2002
02:35:35,937 --> 02:35:40,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Misty says, Oh yeah, F you to school starting January 10th.

2003
02:35:40,400 --> 02:35:41,561
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to refrain from comment.

2004
02:35:41,961 --> 02:35:44,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Raym says, F you MS, depression, and ADD.

2005
02:35:46,965 --> 02:35:50,567
[SPEAKER_05]: K-Dash says, F you to New Year's, cause I was all alone.

2006
02:35:50,728 --> 02:35:51,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sorry.

2007
02:35:52,669 --> 02:35:59,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, next time tune in to see what's going on with the internet radio, because we're around sometimes on New Year's, so I know, what little concession.

2008
02:36:02,795 --> 02:36:07,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Jaded2005 says, F you to people who think I know everything about computers when they can't work them.

[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

2012
02:36:48,991 --> 02:36:58,857
[SPEAKER_05]: We were talking about home versions a little earlier, so I thought maybe we could play some good songs that were on home version stuff.

2013
02:37:02,159 --> 02:37:03,660
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll see if I can find it.

2014
02:37:03,780 --> 02:37:08,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Loki says I have to play a certain song from 2DX, so maybe we'll squeeze that in somewhere too.

2015
02:37:09,323 --> 02:37:10,804
[SPEAKER_05]: We will be back after this.

2016
02:37:10,864 --> 02:37:14,046
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to start it off with a very popular track from DDR Extreme USA.

2017
02:37:14,106 --> 02:37:15,247
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back.

2018
02:37:33,921 --> 02:37:34,282

I heard you were in love, but I knew we were meant to be

2024
02:43:34,421 --> 02:43:38,585
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

2025
02:43:38,805 --> 02:43:40,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want to be staffed by Hollywood?

2026
02:43:41,047 --> 02:43:43,230
[SPEAKER_08]: No!

2027
02:43:43,330 --> 02:43:44,691
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we care what people think of us?

2028
02:43:45,332 --> 02:43:46,993
[SPEAKER_08]: No!

2029
02:43:47,153 --> 02:43:48,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we want people to kiss our ass?

2030
02:43:49,115 --> 02:43:52,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes!

2031
02:43:53,199 --> 02:43:55,101
[SPEAKER_17]: Extreme Bomani Radio.

2032
02:43:55,301 --> 02:43:55,922
[SPEAKER_17]: That's us.

2033
02:43:56,482 --> 02:43:58,024
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge Radio.

2034
02:44:00,595 --> 02:44:03,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2035
02:44:03,096 --> 02:44:04,696
[SPEAKER_05]: We're kind of getting into the home stretch.

2036
02:44:04,776 --> 02:44:09,858
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, some folks in the chat room were kind of asking tonight if we were going to do an Ask Orange Lounge segment.

2037
02:44:09,878 --> 02:44:11,058
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, you know what, sure.

2038
02:44:11,559 --> 02:44:13,399
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a few weeks since we've done Ask Orange Lounge.

2039
02:44:13,579 --> 02:44:14,780
[SPEAKER_05]: We did Listless a couple weeks ago.

2040
02:44:14,800 --> 02:44:15,740
[SPEAKER_05]: We did Match Game and stuff.

2041
02:44:15,760 --> 02:44:17,821
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we haven't done Ask Orange Lounge in a little while.

2042
02:44:17,921 --> 02:44:20,922
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is a segment where you can just basically ask us whatever you want.

2043
02:44:21,342 --> 02:44:25,263
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a great way to get us to actually talk about DDR, if you want.

2044
02:44:26,143 --> 02:44:27,624
[SPEAKER_05]: or you could go out of left field.

2045
02:44:27,664 --> 02:44:30,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you have a relationship problem you want to ask us about.

2046
02:44:30,525 --> 02:44:32,826
[SPEAKER_05]: And Jamie will give you straight up advice, really.

2047
02:44:33,286 --> 02:44:34,266
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I ever.

2048
02:44:34,586 --> 02:44:37,427
[SPEAKER_05]: You may not want to hear it, but she'll give you the honest answer.

2049
02:44:37,607 --> 02:44:39,068
[SPEAKER_05]: But remember, we love you.

2050
02:44:39,408 --> 02:44:40,248
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we're honest.

2051
02:44:40,368 --> 02:44:40,828
[SPEAKER_18]: For dinner.

2052
02:44:41,249 --> 02:44:41,609
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2053
02:44:42,909 --> 02:44:45,170
[SPEAKER_05]: So that being said, let's get into it.

2054
02:44:45,330 --> 02:44:49,492
[SPEAKER_05]: And we kick it off with me making an ass out of myself with a little opening theme song.

2055
02:44:55,976 --> 02:44:58,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid questions.

2056
02:44:59,398 --> 02:45:02,639
[SPEAKER_05]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

2057
02:45:03,159 --> 02:45:06,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Is someone bound to ask a stupid dating question?

2058
02:45:06,901 --> 02:45:10,023
[SPEAKER_05]: I really hope not, because DarkSakura will tear him a new butthole.

2059
02:45:11,824 --> 02:45:12,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Girls.

2060
02:45:18,707 --> 02:45:19,987
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you cooking over there, Loki?

2061
02:45:20,028 --> 02:45:20,708
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to ask.

2062
02:45:20,848 --> 02:45:21,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki's garlicky.

2063
02:45:21,908 --> 02:45:25,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki's cooking, it smells like garlic, and now all of a sudden I'm like, garlic.

2064
02:45:28,041 --> 02:45:29,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you're doing the fried rice thing?

2065
02:45:30,283 --> 02:45:31,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, his fried rice.

2066
02:45:33,025 --> 02:45:33,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful.

2067
02:45:33,585 --> 02:45:34,806
[SPEAKER_05]: He learned from the Benihana chefs.

2068
02:45:35,307 --> 02:45:35,627
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2069
02:45:40,571 --> 02:45:43,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on to question number one.

2070
02:45:43,734 --> 02:45:44,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Illusion.

2071
02:45:44,234 --> 02:45:45,395
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a question from Illusion.

2072
02:45:45,515 --> 02:45:46,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Brace yourself.

2073
02:45:47,537 --> 02:45:48,678
[SPEAKER_05]: You knew this would be random.

2074
02:45:49,838 --> 02:45:55,263
[SPEAKER_05]: If you throw a blender off of the Leaning Tower of Pisa and it lands in the Gulf of Mexico...

2075
02:45:55,993 --> 02:45:58,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Who did the rapping in that one Paranoia remix Loki did?

2076
02:45:58,995 --> 02:46:01,256
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was Paranoia Revolution or something.

2077
02:46:01,657 --> 02:46:03,958
[SPEAKER_05]: He said it would be the last one, if that helps any.

2078
02:46:04,919 --> 02:46:12,103
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Loki did this remix of Paranoia Revolution, and I guess as... I remember this remix that Loki did a while back.

2079
02:46:12,163 --> 02:46:15,025
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, um... What the hell was the name of this, Loki?

2080
02:46:15,045 --> 02:46:17,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we tear you away from the kitchen for just a minute to ask you about this?

2081
02:46:17,506 --> 02:46:18,007
[SPEAKER_05]: The rapping?

2082
02:46:18,707 --> 02:46:20,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, what was the rapping in it from?

2083
02:46:21,649 --> 02:46:23,970
[SPEAKER_07]: That was from a song actually called Revolution.

2084
02:46:24,030 --> 02:46:24,651
[SPEAKER_07]: It's by BT.

2085
02:46:24,671 --> 02:46:24,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2086
02:46:26,031 --> 02:46:30,134
[SPEAKER_07]: I forget who he has that does rapping, but he's on a bunch of different albums.

2087
02:46:30,994 --> 02:46:34,877
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it said who his name was in... I don't remember.

2088
02:46:35,457 --> 02:46:39,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Scotty D. It's not Scotty D. That's retarded.

2089
02:46:40,180 --> 02:46:41,281
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember.

2090
02:46:41,301 --> 02:46:43,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me see here.

2091
02:46:44,503 --> 02:46:51,647
[SPEAKER_05]: While you look for that, let me play a clip from Paranoia Revolution.

2092
02:46:51,947 --> 02:46:53,128
[SPEAKER_05]: The rapping was towards the end, right?

2093
02:46:53,903 --> 02:46:56,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, here's a little clip of Paranoia Revolution so you know what the hell we're talking about.

2094
02:46:56,925 --> 02:47:01,749
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a Loki remix that you can find on his website, which is what, LokiFusion.tk still?

2095
02:47:02,249 --> 02:47:02,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, here it is.

2096
02:47:42,498 --> 02:47:45,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, very sexy clip there from Paranoia Revolution.

2097
02:47:45,439 --> 02:47:47,839
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to download the whole thing, it's LokiFusion.tk.

2098
02:47:48,419 --> 02:47:51,160
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've heard that clip, the revolution will be televised.

2099
02:47:51,180 --> 02:47:52,640
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I saw that on a bumper sticker once.

2100
02:47:52,660 --> 02:47:55,080
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what the guy said in one part there.

2101
02:47:55,520 --> 02:47:55,780
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2102
02:47:56,821 --> 02:47:57,301
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, all right.

2103
02:47:58,321 --> 02:48:03,002
[SPEAKER_05]: While Loki does some more research on that, I'm going to go ahead and move on, and you can come back to this question a little later.

2104
02:48:03,342 --> 02:48:06,963
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's from BT, basically, the short answer to your question.

2105
02:48:07,363 --> 02:48:09,143
[SPEAKER_05]: And Illusion would also like to add...

2106
02:48:10,587 --> 02:48:16,973
[SPEAKER_05]: On a note, and I'm going to play some apologetic music to match his mood here on this note here.

2107
02:48:17,054 --> 02:48:20,517
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll play some very solemn apologetic music here.

2108
02:48:21,398 --> 02:48:22,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, Loki found it.

2109
02:48:24,875 --> 02:48:26,436
[SPEAKER_07]: God damn, who the fuck is this?

2110
02:48:26,956 --> 02:48:50,967
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, it was in the song, uh, Mad Skills, uh, Mike Cheka is the name of the song that was, um, on his album, Movement and Still Life, and they actually, I think, in the song, he says who it is, because, you know, they do that stupid, you know, shout out crap in it, so, um, I don't remember who he's partnered with, but it's the same guy that's on, like, all these albums, and, uh, Movement and Still Life would be a good one, the

2111
02:48:54,979 --> 02:49:04,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let me get to another note from Illusion here.

2112
02:49:05,384 --> 02:49:09,046
[SPEAKER_05]: He would like to offer a formal apology.

2113
02:49:10,486 --> 02:49:12,687
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, I'm sorry.

2114
02:49:13,267 --> 02:49:16,029
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm adding the crying noises because I know he's making them up.

2115
02:49:17,669 --> 02:49:21,251
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry to everyone that I pissed off

2116
02:49:22,897 --> 02:49:30,745
[SPEAKER_05]: I too will be going to community college, though I'm not too excited about it, nor would I be excited about any college.

2117
02:49:31,346 --> 02:49:32,387
[SPEAKER_05]: So, there you have it.

2118
02:49:34,189 --> 02:49:36,071
[SPEAKER_05]: A formal apology courtesy of Illusion.

2119
02:49:37,432 --> 02:49:40,795
[SPEAKER_05]: And there will be a replay of that apology next week on DDO Freak Radio.

2120
02:49:42,757 --> 02:49:44,579
[SPEAKER_05]: In case you missed it or you want to tell your friends.

2121
02:49:45,100 --> 02:49:45,420
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2122
02:49:49,291 --> 02:49:51,632
[SPEAKER_05]: K-Dash has a question about Beatmania 2DX.

2123
02:49:52,153 --> 02:50:02,698
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm planning on buying 2DX and I would like to know if anyone has any tips for me concerning whether I should get a flip top or just a Japanese PlayStation 2 and the best place that I can purchase them from.

2124
02:50:03,119 --> 02:50:03,519
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2125
02:50:03,719 --> 02:50:05,420
[SPEAKER_18]: Japanese PS2 and CSX.

2126
02:50:06,668 --> 02:50:08,209
[SPEAKER_05]: I would also go with the Japanese PlayStation 2.

2127
02:50:08,429 --> 02:50:17,874
[SPEAKER_05]: The flip tops are becoming a little more... Like, you know, if you'd asked us this two years ago, we would have said straight up, do not trust the mods, go for a Japanese PlayStation 2.

2128
02:50:18,555 --> 02:50:22,417
[SPEAKER_05]: They're a little better now, and I think there's more out there that you can kind of trust, but...

2129
02:50:23,061 --> 02:50:23,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Islander

2130
02:50:45,453 --> 02:50:50,798
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, no, I second the whole, you know, getting the Japanese PS2 wholeheartedly.

2131
02:50:51,138 --> 02:50:52,600
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't trust the flip-top still.

2132
02:50:53,020 --> 02:50:53,541
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know why.

2133
02:50:54,682 --> 02:51:02,088
[SPEAKER_20]: And make sure when you buy it, you buy a Japanese PS2, not an Asian PS2.

2134
02:51:02,589 --> 02:51:04,150
[SPEAKER_20]: There is a difference.

2135
02:51:04,451 --> 02:51:04,851
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2136
02:51:06,167 --> 02:51:20,210
[SPEAKER_20]: Even though it is cheaper and it looks like it's going to be a good deal for you, you actually have to use a converter because it is different power than the Japanese PS2, American PS2 voltage.

2137
02:51:20,310 --> 02:51:27,491
[SPEAKER_20]: So you end up putting that amount of money back into a good converter that you don't fry your PS2 with.

2138
02:51:28,331 --> 02:51:29,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good tip.

2139
02:51:29,111 --> 02:51:31,252
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of something people don't think about sometimes.

2140
02:51:32,112 --> 02:51:32,352
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2141
02:51:32,719 --> 02:51:38,281
[SPEAKER_05]: So, as far as that goes, it sounds like we kind of give the consensus, you know what, just go and get the Japanese PlayStation 2.

2142
02:51:39,061 --> 02:51:40,402
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cheap, and you won't regret it later.

2143
02:51:41,422 --> 02:51:47,344
[SPEAKER_05]: And, was she asking what style, too, or did she just ask other tips, or he, I'm sorry, I don't know if it's he or she, sorry.

2144
02:51:49,685 --> 02:51:51,625
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure, so we'll just move on.

2145
02:51:52,386 --> 02:51:56,367
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say as far as styles are concerned, because usually that's another question that goes along with it, is what style should I get?

2146
02:51:56,847 --> 02:52:00,428
[SPEAKER_05]: You really just have to evaluate the song lists and look at the one that has the songs you want.

2147
02:52:00,508 --> 02:52:02,069
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as beginners go, though...

2148
02:52:02,449 --> 02:52:07,411
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't go with 3rd or 4th if you're a beginner just because 5th and later had more beginner-friendly modes in it.

2149
02:52:08,551 --> 02:52:18,174
[SPEAKER_18]: Overall, I would say as far as song selection, actually 8th style doesn't really have too many beginner-friendly songs, even in Light 7.

2150
02:52:21,455 --> 02:52:23,636
[SPEAKER_18]: I would actually point people to 5th style.

2151
02:52:24,156 --> 02:52:26,136
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd say if you're going to start anywhere, start with 5th style.

2152
02:52:26,156 --> 02:52:30,918
[SPEAKER_18]: It has a lot more beginner-friendly songs, except that 6th style does have the beginner mode in it.

2153
02:52:32,432 --> 02:52:34,415
[SPEAKER_18]: So, it really depends.

2154
02:52:34,775 --> 02:52:37,539
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, as far as song selection, 8th style's got a bajillion.

2155
02:52:38,560 --> 02:52:40,283
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, 7th style has a whole bunch.

2156
02:52:41,264 --> 02:52:43,127
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think overall you're best starting with 5th or 6th.

2157
02:52:44,946 --> 02:52:45,506
[SPEAKER_05]: A goal for 2005.

2158
02:52:45,567 --> 02:52:47,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have any goals that you'd like to share?

2159
02:53:12,108 --> 02:53:13,009
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll start it off.

2160
02:53:14,189 --> 02:53:16,431
[SPEAKER_19]: I really want to get to Maniac Mode this year.

2161
02:53:16,491 --> 02:53:16,871
[SPEAKER_19]: That's it.

2162
02:53:17,632 --> 02:53:18,192
[SPEAKER_19]: I gotta do it.

2163
02:53:18,993 --> 02:53:26,157
[SPEAKER_19]: And probably get better at 2DX as well, although I don't really know where I'm going with that, but let's just stick to DDR first.

2164
02:53:28,138 --> 02:53:33,402
[SPEAKER_18]: My goals for this year are very simple, and actually I met one before the year began, because my goal was to be in a new job.

2165
02:53:33,482 --> 02:53:38,065
[SPEAKER_18]: One of my resolutions I put in my live journal was to have a new job, and I actually got that right before...

2166
02:53:39,037 --> 02:53:43,082
[SPEAKER_18]: Goal number one is to lose 50 pounds.

2167
02:53:43,563 --> 02:53:47,668
[SPEAKER_18]: Goal number two is to be enlisted in the Air Force or Army Reserves by the end of the year.

2168
02:53:48,209 --> 02:53:50,532
[SPEAKER_18]: At least to get my man over his anti-military thing.

2169
02:53:53,415 --> 02:53:54,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything you guys on the couch want to share?

2170
02:53:55,506 --> 02:53:56,387
[SPEAKER_20]: I have three of them.

2171
02:53:57,787 --> 02:54:01,409
[SPEAKER_20]: Two of them are most definitely going to happen and the third one is going to take a lot more work.

2172
02:54:02,689 --> 02:54:06,070
[SPEAKER_20]: Goal number one, I'm going to graduate again this year.

2173
02:54:07,211 --> 02:54:19,456
[SPEAKER_20]: So basically my goal is to pass my last class that I have to take in order to graduate and hopefully convince my teacher that I don't have to be there for the day of the final because otherwise I'll be stuck here instead of at E3.

2174
02:54:20,916 --> 02:54:21,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Painful.

2175
02:54:21,877 --> 02:54:22,677
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

2176
02:54:23,258 --> 02:54:30,142
[SPEAKER_20]: Second one is, this is the year that I'm going to be getting out of debt, thankfully, so I have to finish that out.

2177
02:54:30,382 --> 02:54:40,309
[SPEAKER_20]: I would anticipate it probably will be done by about August, so I'll actually be 28 years old and completely debt-free, which is not something that most 28-year-olds can say.

2178
02:54:40,329 --> 02:54:40,849
[SPEAKER_22]: Exactly.

2179
02:54:41,449 --> 02:54:42,590
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'll own my own car.

2180
02:54:43,451 --> 02:54:45,412
[SPEAKER_20]: No making payments or anything like that, and that's

2181
02:54:45,892 --> 02:54:48,354
[SPEAKER_20]: Coming up in about two months.

2182
02:54:48,874 --> 02:54:58,841
[SPEAKER_20]: And then my third, and probably the most important, and the one that's been the biggest problem for me, I'd like to lose another 80 pounds.

2183
02:54:58,921 --> 02:55:06,146
[SPEAKER_20]: Even if I don't lose the weight, and just get down into size 12 or 14, I'd be ecstatic at that.

2184
02:55:06,506 --> 02:55:15,432
[SPEAKER_20]: But I have been working my butt off to try to lose the weight, and it's hard, especially with my conditions and everything.

2185
02:55:16,152 --> 02:55:16,953
[SPEAKER_20]: But I'm going to do it.

2186
02:55:18,154 --> 02:55:18,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Good luck to you.

2187
02:55:18,634 --> 02:55:19,455
[SPEAKER_05]: We're here to support you.

2188
02:55:19,675 --> 02:55:29,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Launch Radio, anybody that is trying to do that right now, your friends are the best support you've got for things like that, I think, sometimes.

2189
02:55:29,963 --> 02:55:31,264
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can look to for encouragement.

2190
02:55:31,404 --> 02:55:40,572
[SPEAKER_05]: And we definitely encourage those of you guys that want to be more fit, and especially Jamie is always telling you guys to go outside once in a while, even though you do have to sit indoors to listen to this show.

2191
02:55:40,632 --> 02:55:41,412
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Sunday night.

2192
02:55:41,532 --> 02:55:44,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that was the Lord's Day to rest, so that's fine.

2193
02:55:45,175 --> 02:55:45,596
[SPEAKER_05]: www.DarkSakura.com

2194
02:56:04,159 --> 02:56:04,439
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

2195
02:56:22,014 --> 02:56:28,157
[SPEAKER_18]: For anyone who uses LiveJournal, I've made, and I actually am thinking of making this just a big support group.

2196
02:56:28,697 --> 02:56:36,120
[SPEAKER_18]: I made a community called GeekFit on LiveJournal, and I just made it this afternoon.

2197
02:56:36,800 --> 02:56:44,283
[SPEAKER_18]: But just for anyone who wants tips, advice, just to share what you're doing, what's working for you.

2198
02:56:44,323 --> 02:56:50,266
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't even have to post every day, but I would encourage people to make use of this that I've opened up for everybody.

2199
02:56:51,128 --> 02:56:55,424
[SPEAKER_18]: LiveJournal.com slash community slash geekfit G-E-E-K-F-I-T

2200
02:56:55,968 --> 02:56:57,949
[SPEAKER_05]: GeekFit, I love the name, that's going to be cool.

2201
02:56:58,789 --> 02:57:00,249
[SPEAKER_05]: So LiveJournal is a great way of support.

2202
02:57:00,369 --> 02:57:05,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, a lot of folks in our chat room are bringing up GetUpMove.com, of course, the DDR fitness site.

2203
02:57:06,150 --> 02:57:13,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Although GetUpMove.com, a little bit commercial because it's kind of a red octane thing, but I have kind of looked at, I've lurked on the forums a little bit.

2204
02:57:13,512 --> 02:57:14,752
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the forums are really cool.

2205
02:57:15,133 --> 02:57:24,555
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think if you want to find people in the same boat that are kind of using DDR as a way to get more active and lose weight, I think the forums are really great help over there on GetUpMove.com.

2206
02:57:24,575 --> 02:57:25,235
[SPEAKER_05]: So check those out.

2207
02:57:25,675 --> 02:57:26,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.

2208
02:57:28,196 --> 02:57:29,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Boy, okay.

2209
02:57:29,577 --> 02:57:32,698
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess we should move on or else we're going to run out of show time and not get to everybody's questions.

2210
02:57:32,718 --> 02:57:34,439
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got to breeze through these last few questions here.

2211
02:57:34,479 --> 02:57:35,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other goals?

2212
02:57:35,079 --> 02:57:37,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody want to get out there?

2213
02:57:37,320 --> 02:57:49,365
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have some other goals and that would probably be just I want to... I'm kind of looking forward to 2006 where I want to buy a house in 2006 and not be a renter anymore.

2214
02:57:49,426 --> 02:57:52,127
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to do one more year of renting something and then I want to try and buy in 2006.

2215
02:57:52,987 --> 02:57:56,789
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to take establishing more credit and things like that and being a good boy and things like that.

2216
02:57:57,449 --> 02:57:59,530
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll see what happens with that.

2217
02:57:59,731 --> 02:58:01,592
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, there's relationship goals, too.

2218
02:58:01,632 --> 02:58:07,154
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, I don't think you can really set those kind of goals because then you'll have these expectations that may not be met.

2219
02:58:07,174 --> 02:58:08,695
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just setting yourself up for disappointment.

2220
02:58:09,316 --> 02:58:12,277
[SPEAKER_05]: So while the wish is there, it's not really a goal.

2221
02:58:12,637 --> 02:58:13,097
[SPEAKER_05]: What can you say?

2222
02:58:13,798 --> 02:58:14,098
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2223
02:58:16,483 --> 02:58:22,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on, MPQ wants to know, why did it take my Poppin' Music 5 soundtrack so long to arrive?

2224
02:58:24,127 --> 02:58:30,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I imagine the mix is several, or it's a couple years old now, so it's probably just hard to find.

2225
02:58:30,831 --> 02:58:31,751
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the holidays.

2226
02:58:32,872 --> 02:58:33,252
[SPEAKER_05]: That too?

2227
02:58:33,312 --> 02:58:34,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Makes sense to me.

2228
02:58:34,233 --> 02:58:35,053
[SPEAKER_05]: There, there you go.

2229
02:58:35,513 --> 02:58:36,294
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll take a while.

2230
02:58:36,314 --> 02:58:38,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Bad weather, holding up packages.

2231
02:58:38,515 --> 02:58:38,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

2232
02:58:39,375 --> 02:58:40,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Tsunamis.

2233
02:58:40,776 --> 02:58:42,397
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody knows it's Al-Qaeda.

2234
02:58:43,318 --> 02:58:44,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki's ranting about Al-Qaeda?

2235
02:58:44,758 --> 02:58:45,759
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2236
02:58:50,509 --> 02:58:55,270
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S wants to know, did you all get everything that you wanted for Christmas?

2237
02:58:58,950 --> 02:59:04,111
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I did not, and I don't care because I can work on it this year if I really want to.

2238
02:59:06,992 --> 02:59:07,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody else?

2239
02:59:08,392 --> 02:59:11,373
[SPEAKER_18]: There were a couple of things I wanted, but I for the most part got what I wanted.

2240
02:59:13,385 --> 02:59:15,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Me personally, I didn't really have a list of demands.

2241
02:59:15,587 --> 02:59:17,949
[SPEAKER_05]: I just said I wanted to hang out with people more, and I did.

2242
02:59:17,989 --> 02:59:21,953
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to some pretty cool parties in December, so, you know, it's all good.

2243
02:59:22,053 --> 02:59:27,457
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really have... The one material thing I wanted, I went out and I bought myself.

2244
02:59:27,798 --> 02:59:29,139
[SPEAKER_05]: I got it, so, the end.

2245
02:59:29,780 --> 02:59:32,062
[SPEAKER_07]: My raw plutonium's still in the mail, they tell me.

2246
02:59:35,204 --> 02:59:36,686
[SPEAKER_18]: You didn't get your portal to hell, did you?

2247
02:59:37,366 --> 02:59:38,387
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't started it yet.

2248
02:59:38,647 --> 02:59:39,388
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't really leaked

2249
02:59:39,980 --> 02:59:42,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy has kept me away from contacting the dead.

2250
02:59:42,500 --> 02:59:43,021
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

2251
02:59:44,921 --> 02:59:45,661
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, it's funny.

2252
02:59:45,801 --> 03:00:00,024
[SPEAKER_18]: I was watching something on TV where I don't remember the show it was because I just happened to pass it while Dan was watching where they were talking about your experiment as going to be something that they were doing a news report on.

2253
03:00:02,844 --> 03:00:03,504
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that was it.

2254
03:00:03,544 --> 03:00:06,265
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a movie and they were talking about the movie.

2255
03:00:07,423 --> 03:00:08,043
[SPEAKER_18]: That was it.

2256
03:00:08,324 --> 03:00:11,365
[SPEAKER_18]: And I was like, oh, that's Loki's portal to hell.

2257
03:00:15,207 --> 03:00:16,348
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to be like you.

2258
03:00:16,588 --> 03:00:17,468
[SPEAKER_18]: You cool guy, you.

2259
03:00:18,229 --> 03:00:21,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I gotta wrap this up, so I'm sorry because I'm cutting a few people's questions off.

2260
03:00:21,771 --> 03:00:22,571
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really sorry to you guys.

2261
03:00:22,591 --> 03:00:23,872
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to have to make this the last question.

2262
03:00:24,392 --> 03:00:27,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Vidpower wants to know, I recently picked up Tycho Drummaster.

2263
03:00:27,934 --> 03:00:29,294
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you guys think of this game?

2264
03:00:29,495 --> 03:00:30,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Any advice?

2265
03:00:30,095 --> 03:00:30,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Real quick.

2266
03:00:30,755 --> 03:00:31,716
[SPEAKER_19]: It makes my hands hurt.

2267
03:00:32,956 --> 03:00:33,917
[SPEAKER_22]: Freaking badass.

2268
03:00:34,017 --> 03:00:34,517
[SPEAKER_22]: I love the game.

2269
03:00:35,258 --> 03:00:35,758
[SPEAKER_19]: I love it too.

2270
03:00:37,512 --> 03:00:39,793
[SPEAKER_19]: I still can't get over Katamari on the Rock, so you know what?

2271
03:00:40,073 --> 03:00:40,634
[SPEAKER_19]: Deal with it!

2272
03:00:44,716 --> 03:00:53,101
[SPEAKER_05]: I have yet to check out the US version, but my advice to you would be, if you like the US version, there's about five of them in Japan that are just waiting for you to pick them up.

2273
03:00:53,421 --> 03:00:54,161
[SPEAKER_20]: Take breaks.

2274
03:00:55,282 --> 03:00:56,843
[SPEAKER_20]: Otherwise you're going to kill your forearms.

2275
03:00:58,112 --> 03:01:02,114
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a friend, my friend that got Donkey Konga complained of the same thing from playing it too much.

2276
03:01:02,134 --> 03:01:09,738
[SPEAKER_05]: And even though it's a little bit different style still, I mean, as with any game that requires you to move motion, even DDR, take breaks.

2277
03:01:09,878 --> 03:01:10,978
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, take breaks once in a while.

2278
03:01:11,358 --> 03:01:13,979
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why you get a break stage on workout mode and things like that.

2279
03:01:15,660 --> 03:01:16,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other advice?

2280
03:01:17,361 --> 03:01:17,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2281
03:01:18,121 --> 03:01:20,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's going to bring that segment to a close.

2282
03:01:20,362 --> 03:01:22,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys for the good questions tonight.

2283
03:01:22,383 --> 03:01:23,103
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate that.

2284
03:01:23,624 --> 03:01:23,744
[SPEAKER_05]: And...

2285
03:01:25,612 --> 03:01:26,612
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, PumpUpTheVolume

2286
03:01:53,049 --> 03:02:04,837
[SPEAKER_05]: and also this Tuesday I will be playing the repeat yes, the one chance to catch the repeat on Orange Lounge Radio you'll catch that this Tuesday your one and only shot but DDR Freak Radio

2287
03:02:05,723 --> 03:02:06,403
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2288
03:02:33,650 --> 03:02:36,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, and what else?

2289
03:02:37,871 --> 03:02:39,832
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll actually see a lot of faces two years ago.

2290
03:02:39,852 --> 03:02:42,793
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you're one of the few people that was here two years ago that's still here.

2291
03:02:42,833 --> 03:02:45,374
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of folks that were here two years ago aren't here anymore, which is kind of sad.

2292
03:02:46,054 --> 03:02:47,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Except Loki, he's still here.

2293
03:02:47,714 --> 03:02:48,915
[SPEAKER_05]: He smooched his way onto the show.

2294
03:02:49,935 --> 03:02:52,596
[SPEAKER_19]: And see, when I was on the show, he was sitting on the floor.

2295
03:02:52,716 --> 03:02:53,816
[SPEAKER_19]: Now he's sitting on the floor!

2296
03:02:55,517 --> 03:02:56,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, alright.

2297
03:02:56,377 --> 03:02:57,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's his apartment now.

2298
03:02:58,358 --> 03:02:58,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway...

2299
03:02:59,853 --> 03:03:04,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, also Thursday night, Outside the Box has been hitting some road bumps lately.

2300
03:03:04,515 --> 03:03:05,175
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, you guys.

2301
03:03:05,236 --> 03:03:07,617
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just that Rice Princess and Lanky Stahl have had other commitments.

2302
03:03:08,417 --> 03:03:10,618
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to try and maybe play with that a little bit.

2303
03:03:10,678 --> 03:03:12,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully we can bring Outside the Box back this week.

2304
03:03:12,779 --> 03:03:15,880
[SPEAKER_05]: If not, we might kind of change the format a little bit and try something else.

2305
03:03:17,121 --> 03:03:18,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep your eyes on OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

2306
03:03:20,097 --> 03:03:22,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Something exciting is coming very soon.

2307
03:03:22,879 --> 03:03:23,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Very soon.

2308
03:03:23,699 --> 03:03:24,700
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I can say right now.

2309
03:03:25,120 --> 03:03:31,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Friday nights, DDR Freak Radio, working together with us to bring you the Orange Launch Radio Rewind, 6 o'clock.

2310
03:03:31,184 --> 03:03:37,408
[SPEAKER_05]: If you missed this show, any part of it, or a previous week's show, tune in over at The Freak, 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

2311
03:03:38,248 --> 03:03:41,910
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's about all the whoring I needed to do tonight for all the various stuff we're involved with.

2312
03:03:41,950 --> 03:03:42,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes?

2313
03:03:43,431 --> 03:03:44,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else?

2314
03:03:45,733 --> 03:03:47,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Any of our guests have anything they want to plug?

2315
03:03:48,514 --> 03:03:48,694
[SPEAKER_05]: No?

2316
03:03:48,894 --> 03:03:49,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Think we hit it all?

2317
03:03:49,515 --> 03:03:49,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

2318
03:03:50,447 --> 03:03:51,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Gwana Girl?

2319
03:03:52,890 --> 03:03:56,314
[SPEAKER_20]: When you're not listening to Orange Lounge, go listen to DDR Freak Radio, that is all.

2320
03:03:57,215 --> 03:03:57,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2321
03:03:58,416 --> 03:03:58,796
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

2322
03:03:59,097 --> 03:04:00,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, just support internet radio in general.

2323
03:04:02,236 --> 03:04:31,003
[SPEAKER_05]: just turn off your regular corporate commercially fed and I know a lot of people bitch that Life 365 plays too many commercials but you know what guys it is nothing compared to corporate radio turn on your FCC regulated censored airwaves sometime and take a listen to the crap they have on there and then tell me Life 365 sucks I have some great news for everybody too also G4 Tech TV or G4 TV the two girls on G4TechTV.com promised that they wouldn't suck this year

2324
03:04:32,361 --> 03:04:37,304
[SPEAKER_07]: I know everybody's so enthusiastic because the channel's not going to suck anymore because they said so.

2325
03:04:37,564 --> 03:04:39,245
[SPEAKER_22]: But what if you're one of their boyfriends?

2326
03:04:39,605 --> 03:04:42,167
[SPEAKER_07]: But they also promised to do some lesbian action on there.

2327
03:04:43,287 --> 03:04:44,108
[SPEAKER_07]: That was their promise.

2328
03:04:46,249 --> 03:04:49,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I will one-up that.

2329
03:04:49,111 --> 03:04:54,554
[SPEAKER_05]: This year we will continue to not suck and we will bring you a hot lesbian action at some point during the year.

2330
03:04:55,454 --> 03:04:57,456
[SPEAKER_05]: That gives us 360 days to work with here.

2331
03:04:59,557 --> 03:05:01,478
[SPEAKER_05]: At some point we will bring you hot lesbian action.

2332
03:05:02,003 --> 03:05:06,104
[SPEAKER_05]: and maybe some hot gay action too for you folks that are into that.

2333
03:05:08,285 --> 03:05:11,846
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll not only give you one instance of lesbian action, we'll give you two!

2334
03:05:12,646 --> 03:05:13,307
[SPEAKER_07]: How's that?

2335
03:05:13,667 --> 03:05:15,807
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you like them apples, G4TV?

2336
03:05:16,047 --> 03:05:16,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh?

2337
03:05:16,408 --> 03:05:16,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh?

2338
03:05:18,228 --> 03:05:18,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2339
03:05:19,008 --> 03:05:21,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, also the email boxes are open.

2340
03:05:21,669 --> 03:05:22,249
[SPEAKER_05]: We have email.

2341
03:05:22,269 --> 03:05:25,811
[SPEAKER_05]: If you ever want to say hi to us in email, you have a suggestion, comment, send us email.

2342
03:05:25,871 --> 03:05:29,932
[SPEAKER_05]: It's rob at orangelongerator.com or jamie at orangelongerator.com

2343
03:05:30,829 --> 03:05:32,890
[SPEAKER_05]: or loki.com.

2344
03:05:33,510 --> 03:05:47,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Now folks, I know that you guys like to tell me that my penis is small and that my breasts need enlarging, but I'd like some actual male too, other than these other things.

2345
03:05:48,133 --> 03:05:54,075
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have any problem with my sexual performance, so I don't need any of those pills either, but thanks for the offers anyways.

2346
03:05:54,861 --> 03:05:55,521
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we got to go.

2347
03:05:55,561 --> 03:05:56,022
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, guys.

2348
03:05:56,042 --> 03:05:56,502
[SPEAKER_05]: We're running over.

2349
03:05:56,562 --> 03:05:57,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Final thoughts.

2350
03:05:57,843 --> 03:05:58,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear it.

2351
03:05:58,623 --> 03:06:00,144
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll start with Islander since he has a mic.

2352
03:06:00,325 --> 03:06:00,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Final thoughts.

2353
03:06:02,166 --> 03:06:02,366
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

2354
03:06:02,386 --> 03:06:02,986
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all you, buddy.

2355
03:06:04,127 --> 03:06:04,988
[SPEAKER_22]: None at the time.

2356
03:06:05,268 --> 03:06:06,308
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't think of one.

2357
03:06:07,049 --> 03:06:07,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

2358
03:06:07,529 --> 03:06:07,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Come back to me.

2359
03:06:09,030 --> 03:06:09,490
[SPEAKER_05]: I want a girl.

2360
03:06:09,691 --> 03:06:10,091
[SPEAKER_22]: Final thought.

2361
03:06:10,411 --> 03:06:11,392
[SPEAKER_20]: My side hurts.

2362
03:06:11,992 --> 03:06:12,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Feel better.

2363
03:06:12,993 --> 03:06:13,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Take drugs.

2364
03:06:14,354 --> 03:06:14,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Jazz.

2365
03:06:15,634 --> 03:06:17,155
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not understand.

2366
03:06:19,477 --> 03:06:19,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Angel.

2367
03:06:21,038 --> 03:06:22,559
[SPEAKER_19]: The addiction helped not.

2368
03:06:25,379 --> 03:06:25,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Islander.

2369
03:06:26,179 --> 03:06:26,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Girls.

2370
03:06:29,161 --> 03:06:29,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie.

2371
03:06:31,202 --> 03:06:32,302
[SPEAKER_18]: Go out and play a real game.

2372
03:06:33,623 --> 03:06:34,043
No!

2373
03:06:34,644 --> 03:06:35,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

2374
03:06:35,804 --> 03:06:41,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Playing 10 minute long marathon courses in Stepmania may hinder your ability for masturbation.

2375
03:06:44,148 --> 03:06:48,710
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is I still got to work in my 20 minutes of DDR today so let's call it a wrap, shall we?

2376
03:06:49,131 --> 03:06:50,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Final word of the show.

2377
03:06:50,451 --> 03:06:52,532
[SPEAKER_05]: One word to sum up the whole damn show.

2378
03:06:52,952 --> 03:06:53,893
[SPEAKER_05]: In one word...

2379
03:06:55,168 --> 03:06:56,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Jazz, don't let me down.

2380
03:06:57,990 --> 03:06:58,410
[SPEAKER_17]: Girls.

03:06:59,671 --> 03:07:04,534
[SPEAKER_17]: That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

2382
03:07:05,374 --> 03:07:09,577

2396
03:10:29,586 --> 03:10:33,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright guys, this is the part of the show called the Afterbirth.

2397
03:10:33,810 --> 03:10:42,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Now what I have to kind of put out there is that our Afterbirth segments are going to be changing a little bit in the future because of something else that we're doing and I can't...

2398
03:10:42,998 --> 03:10:46,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Spill the beans just yet, but trust me, you'll be cool with this once you find out.

2399
03:10:46,441 --> 03:10:48,022
[SPEAKER_05]: So our afterbursts are going to be a little bit shorter.

2400
03:10:48,623 --> 03:10:56,830
[SPEAKER_05]: And just so you guys know, when our shows are over, you're going to be going back straight to the Orange Lounge Radio Bomani Music and More program.

2401
03:10:56,870 --> 03:10:58,171
[SPEAKER_05]: That does mean you get dumped from the stream.

2402
03:10:58,191 --> 03:10:59,913
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to have to reconnect in 30 seconds.

2403
03:11:00,313 --> 03:11:01,554
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's no big deal, right?

2404
03:11:01,614 --> 03:11:04,577
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys still love Orange Lounge and will listen to it, right?

2405
03:11:04,997 --> 03:11:06,178
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they hate us.

2406
03:11:06,238 --> 03:11:06,999
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, they hate us.

2407
03:11:08,340 --> 03:11:09,421
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that was a good show tonight.

2408
03:11:09,461 --> 03:11:10,141
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a very good show.

2409
03:11:10,942 --> 03:11:20,188
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it when Iguana Girl and Jazz comes in from out of town and Islander's here and Angel's here, of course, and Loki has food so he's happy.

2410
03:11:20,748 --> 03:11:22,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, you look pretty pissed off at the beginning of the show.

2411
03:11:23,230 --> 03:11:26,372
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you tripped on something and I saw you just go into anger mode.

2412
03:11:26,392 --> 03:11:26,812
[SPEAKER_05]: What happened?

2413
03:11:27,679 --> 03:11:29,560
[SPEAKER_07]: I tripped on two sets of cords.

2414
03:11:29,660 --> 03:11:33,022
[SPEAKER_07]: First, set number one going from the cabinet to the chair.

2415
03:11:33,443 --> 03:11:39,346
[SPEAKER_07]: And set number two going from the table next to the cabinet to somewhere towards the wall.

2416
03:11:39,366 --> 03:11:41,087
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like two trip wires that we have in here.

2417
03:11:41,367 --> 03:11:42,128
[SPEAKER_07]: And I hit them both.

2418
03:11:42,968 --> 03:11:44,749
[SPEAKER_07]: And that and I had a fucking headache.

2419
03:11:44,809 --> 03:11:47,051
[SPEAKER_07]: And it seems to be going away now that I have food.

2420
03:11:47,171 --> 03:11:51,233
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's probably because I didn't eat since 11.

2421
03:11:51,654 --> 03:11:55,616
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I did eat at 11, it was four day old twists.

2422
03:11:56,471 --> 03:11:56,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Ew!

2423
03:11:57,812 --> 03:12:01,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Literally, my jaw was sore from chewing those twists.

2424
03:12:01,796 --> 03:12:07,080
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, you know, if you work out, you know, while you can't move your arm, well, that was like my jaw.

2425
03:12:07,220 --> 03:12:07,780
[SPEAKER_07]: It sucked.

2426
03:12:08,241 --> 03:12:13,245
[SPEAKER_07]: But, so I made my fried rice thing, and I have enough now for the whole week, so I'm gonna eat it.

2427
03:12:14,816 --> 03:12:16,177
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to comment in the chat room.

2428
03:12:16,197 --> 03:12:19,399
[SPEAKER_05]: There's still a few people in there over at www.orange.com and chat.

2429
03:12:19,959 --> 03:12:22,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Dark Knight says, dang, the studio cleared out fast, didn't it?

2430
03:12:22,280 --> 03:12:28,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, this is very typical where most of our guests take off during the closing credits there, just like a lot of our listeners do.

2431
03:12:28,844 --> 03:12:31,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we understand it's kind of late for you guys out there, especially on the East Coast.

2432
03:12:32,005 --> 03:12:34,567
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, what, 12.30 your time out there, so pretty late.

2433
03:12:35,627 --> 03:12:40,410
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, obviously, Iguana Girl is kind of hurting there a little bit, and Jazz...

2434
03:12:41,178 --> 03:13:09,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Jazz had to drive back to the bay tonight so it's very typical where people have just got to get somewhere else so it's kind of interesting with radio though sometimes you can't always tell people will run into the studio sometimes while the opening is playing and be in their seat right in time for the show to start and you know live TV and other live radio programs work this exact same way so it's just kind of funny the illusion that it sometimes gives that we've been sitting here for a half hour waiting for the show to start no I don't think so

2435
03:13:11,656 --> 03:13:12,116
[SPEAKER_05]: We love you!

2436
03:13:12,136 --> 03:13:12,436
[SPEAKER_05]: We love you!

2437
03:13:38,666 --> 03:13:40,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!
