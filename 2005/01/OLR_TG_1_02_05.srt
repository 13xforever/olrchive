00:00:10,685 --> 00:00:15,028
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

3
00:00:16,009 --> 00:00:21,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everybody and welcome to the very first Orange Lounge Radio Podcast.

00:00:29,751 --> 00:00:52,801
[SPEAKER_02]: and then of course we have one more host you guys have all come to know and love and I'm hungry no I'm Loki alright so Orange Lounge Radio this is going to be the first edition of our podcast so what is this all about the Orange Lounge Radio podcast the idea behind this is this great new technology that's out there on the internet that's basically you can kind of think of it as an audio blog

7
00:00:53,419 --> 00:00:55,160
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's something that you can subscribe to.

8
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,261
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're hearing this, you've figured out via our website how to subscribe to our podcast.

9
00:00:59,701 --> 00:01:03,162
[SPEAKER_02]: And now what you're going to be able to do is that you stay subscribed to our podcast.

10
00:01:03,482 --> 00:01:07,323
[SPEAKER_02]: And about every week or so, you're going to get a brand new episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

11
00:01:07,643 --> 00:01:12,505
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is not just rehashed, re-edited stuff that's on our normal three-hour live talk program.

12
00:01:12,525 --> 00:01:19,647
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an all-new program that's made specifically for you to take with you in your pocket everywhere you go.

13
00:01:20,687 --> 00:01:22,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Just promise to treat us gently.

14
00:01:23,035 --> 00:01:24,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio

15
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:42,970
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

16
00:02:11,864 --> 00:02:24,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Beatmania, then we had Dance Dance Revolution, that's the one you guys have all heard about, certainly, and then we have other games that came out in that series, Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, Para Para Paradise, all these types of games, right?

17
00:02:25,094 --> 00:02:30,498
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the meantime, other folks notice what Konami's doing, and they come out with their own music games that are pretty good.

18
00:02:30,538 --> 00:02:39,445
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got Amplitude, you've got Frequency, and then you've got Donkey Konga, Taiko Drum Master now, and then of course you had the granddaddies of them all,

19
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,973
[SPEAKER_02]: The very first games we saw like this, one of your favorites, right Jamie?

20
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:46,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, my Busta Move.

21
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:47,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Busta Move.

22
00:02:47,774 --> 00:02:52,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you get annoyed when people call this Busta Groove though, right?

23
00:02:52,616 --> 00:03:01,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, because Busta Move, the only reason why it's Busta Groove over here is because Taito has Busta Move licensed for Puzzle Bobble.

24
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:05,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Which Puzzle Bobble is a lot cuter name for the little bubble game.

25
00:03:05,443 --> 00:03:07,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it was Bubble Bobble and you had Puzzle Bobble.

26
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:09,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Bust a move.

27
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,102
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, how do you bust a groove?

28
00:03:11,882 --> 00:03:12,303
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you do?

29
00:03:12,343 --> 00:03:15,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like fill it with something and then hit it with a jackhammer?

30
00:03:15,626 --> 00:03:15,986
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

31
00:03:17,608 --> 00:03:18,829
[SPEAKER_01]: How can you serve someone?

32
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:21,472
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just in the same category right there.

33
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:22,493
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make any sense.

34
00:03:23,334 --> 00:03:23,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.

35
00:03:24,778 --> 00:03:29,642
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so of course we have this love for music video games because it's how we all kind of came together.

36
00:03:29,682 --> 00:03:42,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you'll notice, if you visit huge websites dedicated to these games out there, things such as DDRFreak.com, things such as BomaniStyle, DDRSpot, and of course OrangeLaunchRadio.com, you notice that there's quite a little following to these games.

37
00:03:42,511 --> 00:03:44,853
[SPEAKER_02]: However, OrangeLaunchRadio, we kind of want to expand.

38
00:03:44,913 --> 00:03:45,654
[SPEAKER_02]: We noticed that...

39
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:53,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Video gaming, while it's addressed out there in the internet radio world, it's just not covered quite the way we think we can do it.

40
00:03:53,517 --> 00:03:57,658
[SPEAKER_02]: So we like to call ourselves also Video Game News About Games That Don't Suck.

41
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:02,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Which sometimes get fewer and fewer.

42
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,761
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd be surprised.

43
00:04:03,801 --> 00:04:06,722
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's just so many great new games out there we want to talk about as well.

44
00:04:06,982 --> 00:04:07,502
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

45
00:04:07,982 --> 00:04:11,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Even when a game sometimes does suck, we've got to let you know about it so that you don't buy it.

46
00:04:11,924 --> 00:04:12,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

47
00:04:13,288 --> 00:04:13,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Driver 3.

48
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:53,352
[SPEAKER_02]: and what they're talking about is that Konami is going to showcase over at the Consumer Electronics Show 2005 and Konami is going to actually feature Dance Dance Revolution at the show from January 6th through the 9th and they're going to be doing this thing called the Cardio Play Zone so now of course the Consumer Electronics Show this is something that takes place in America

49
00:04:53,892 --> 00:05:04,314
[SPEAKER_02]: They're probably going to be selling games such as, you know, well, I mean, not literally selling there at the show, but they're going to be pushing games such as DDR Ultramix 2, DDR Extreme, things that came out this year.

50
00:05:04,714 --> 00:05:09,795
[SPEAKER_02]: But what a really good time to be pushing this Get Fit envelope right at the beginning of the year, huh?

51
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:13,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Because everyone's going to be making their New Year's resolutions.

52
00:05:13,776 --> 00:05:18,256
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, everyone's going to get in a big frenzy to buy it right there at the beginning of the year.

53
00:05:18,356 --> 00:05:21,117
[SPEAKER_03]: So even if they lose their momentum later on, they've already made the purchase.

54
00:05:23,044 --> 00:05:23,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

55
00:05:23,664 --> 00:05:26,786
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you are somebody that actually goes to a gym on a regular basis.

56
00:05:26,846 --> 00:05:27,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

57
00:05:27,486 --> 00:05:31,008
[SPEAKER_02]: You play DDR for a workout sometimes, but you get your real workout at the gym, right?

58
00:05:31,628 --> 00:05:34,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me about what happens in January versus what happens in June.

59
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,991
[SPEAKER_03]: The gym fills up with so many stupid people.

60
00:05:39,312 --> 00:05:43,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, we're going to work out five million days a week, and we're going to get fit.

61
00:05:43,353 --> 00:05:46,115
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, a month later, it's back to business as usual.

62
00:05:46,215 --> 00:05:48,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a couple of them will stay, but, you know...

63
00:05:49,611 --> 00:05:58,337
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why for anyone, I say if anyone's ever going to make that resolution to get fit, start light because you will burn yourself out like just about all those other people do at the gym.

64
00:05:59,318 --> 00:05:59,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

65
00:06:00,578 --> 00:06:10,185
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're going to play DDR to get fit, you know, we've talked a lot about on our three-hour program, we've talked a lot about how, you know, folks use DDR in their diet and things like that.

66
00:06:10,505 --> 00:06:12,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Just remember to stick with it, okay?

67
00:06:12,507 --> 00:06:14,208
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to play, play on a

68
00:06:16,523 --> 00:06:17,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm speaking from experience here.

69
00:06:18,223 --> 00:06:20,564
[SPEAKER_02]: If you stop playing for a while, you lose it.

70
00:06:20,724 --> 00:06:24,365
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just the skill you lose, but you lose your stamina, and it sucks.

71
00:06:25,225 --> 00:06:26,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, I can attest to that.

72
00:06:26,905 --> 00:06:33,647
[SPEAKER_01]: See, right now I'm working on the first stage of our coverage of the aerobic aspects of DDR.

73
00:06:33,987 --> 00:06:36,167
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working on the fattening up stage, okay?

74
00:06:36,527 --> 00:06:38,588
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll get into actual gameplay.

75
00:06:38,728 --> 00:06:44,129
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say when, but at some point we'll start playing again, or at least I'll start playing again, and

76
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:45,832
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

77
00:06:55,747 --> 00:06:58,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, what I want to talk about is going on in Bomani News right now.

78
00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:00,591
[SPEAKER_02]: This has to do with DDR Ultramix 2.

79
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome mix that's out there for the Xbox.

80
00:07:04,374 --> 00:07:11,359
[SPEAKER_02]: They partnered up with a different drum.com, the label there, and just gave a whole new style of music to it.

81
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:17,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, through the DDR Freak forums, we actually know some of the new songs that are going to be in Downloadable Song Pack 8.

82
00:07:17,824 --> 00:07:19,326
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys can look forward to these songs.

83
00:07:19,726 --> 00:07:22,508
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Cosmic Cowgirls going to be in Song Pack 8.

84
00:07:22,768 --> 00:07:24,069
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the song that was in Guitar Freaks.

85
00:07:24,089 --> 00:07:24,690
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember that song?

86
00:07:27,431 --> 00:07:28,451
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that song.

87
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:28,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

88
00:07:28,852 --> 00:07:30,252
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my drum mania song.

89
00:07:30,312 --> 00:07:30,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Cosmic Cowgirl.

90
00:07:31,573 --> 00:07:33,153
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a remix of Kind Lady.

91
00:07:33,173 --> 00:07:37,835
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know exactly what the remix title is yet, but there will be a remix of Kind Lady in the song pack.

92
00:07:38,336 --> 00:07:41,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Another remix of In My Eyes is going to be happening as well.

93
00:07:41,997 --> 00:07:46,519
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Togo Project featuring Sana, More Deep, version 2.1.

94
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:51,622
[SPEAKER_02]: This song, you might remember, was a hidden song in Max 2 USA, so now it's going to cross over to the Xbox.

95
00:07:52,102 --> 00:07:54,063
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a really interesting one, I thought.

96
00:07:54,723 --> 00:07:54,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh,

97
00:07:55,936 --> 00:08:02,458
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can even pronounce this right, it's a song from Guitar Freak 6th and Drum Mania 5th, and it's crossing over into DDR.

98
00:08:02,518 --> 00:08:05,239
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Balalakia, Carried with the Wind.

99
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:06,960
[SPEAKER_02]: You know this one?

100
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,020
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of an interesting one.

101
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:09,741
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

102
00:08:10,181 --> 00:08:15,843
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to hear those songs in their entirety, we'll be playing them on Orange Lounge Radio at some point a little bit of a later date.

103
00:08:16,243 --> 00:08:16,483
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

104
00:08:17,683 --> 00:08:25,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, as you know, on Orange Lounge Radio, the program which we have Sunday night, 630 Pacific Standard Time, we have this little segment we like to do called the FUs of the Week.

105
00:08:26,431 --> 00:08:31,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what we've decided to do for this portable version is, you know, Jamie still has a little bit of anger.

106
00:08:32,574 --> 00:08:33,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a little bit.

107
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the pain, the anger.

108
00:08:34,315 --> 00:08:36,956
[SPEAKER_02]: But she's going to use that anger for the forces of good.

109
00:08:38,696 --> 00:08:40,977
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's going to have her own... Is that what they're calling it now?

110
00:08:41,037 --> 00:08:42,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's what they're calling it now.

111
00:08:42,498 --> 00:08:44,939
[SPEAKER_02]: So now she's going to have her advice column.

112
00:08:44,979 --> 00:08:48,161
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Jamie, if you would, please tell us your advice column for this week.

113
00:08:48,881 --> 00:08:53,243
[SPEAKER_03]: My first piece of advice for this first podcast is...

114
00:08:54,648 --> 00:08:58,652
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have to sign a contract, read the damn thing first.

115
00:08:59,432 --> 00:09:09,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't just sign your name to it and then call customer service when you don't understand what you've just signed when they bill you for something or when something goes wrong because you were a big retard and didn't read it.

116
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Always read before you sign.

117
00:09:12,864 --> 00:09:15,707
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care how many damn pages it is or if it's in Swahili.

118
00:09:17,483 --> 00:09:19,945
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's a contract, they have to pay for you to read it.

119
00:09:20,005 --> 00:09:20,765
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get a lawyer.

120
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Just read it first.

121
00:09:23,087 --> 00:09:27,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Understand what you are signing your name to, because a contract is binding and legal.

122
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you're under the age of majority within your state, and then that's another story.

123
00:09:30,692 --> 00:09:37,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct me if I'm wrong, though, but if everybody actually read their contracts, wouldn't customer service employees be without a job?

124
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:39,859
[SPEAKER_03]: No, because people are still fundamentally retarded.

125
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:40,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

126
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Just checking.

127
00:09:43,427 --> 00:09:46,008
[SPEAKER_01]: And really now, why would you be signing a contract in Swahili?

128
00:09:46,048 --> 00:09:47,328
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's just retarded.

129
00:09:48,128 --> 00:09:49,148
[SPEAKER_03]: What if you're from Africa?

130
00:09:50,409 --> 00:09:52,149
[SPEAKER_01]: But, ah, damn it.

131
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,290
[SPEAKER_01]: Still though, it should be English.

132
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:56,390
[SPEAKER_01]: English.

133
00:09:58,451 --> 00:09:59,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, alright.

134
00:10:00,111 --> 00:10:02,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, tell us what's going on in the sim scene this week.

135
00:10:02,552 --> 00:10:08,393
[SPEAKER_02]: For those guys that like to emulate their favorite music games on the computer, or, I'm sorry, emulate versus simulate.

136
00:10:08,413 --> 00:10:09,774
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get yelled at by somebody for that.

137
00:10:10,294 --> 00:10:10,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Simulate.

138
00:10:11,789 --> 00:10:18,055
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, really, one big thing, because a lot of websites are down because of different reasons.

139
00:10:18,155 --> 00:10:27,124
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, the big thing that came out this week would be Technofiend 3, which is the brand new Stepmania skin, for those who might not know.

140
00:10:28,745 --> 00:10:32,509
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just released, actually, on Bumaisel.com.

141
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:36,612
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find it in their downloadable sim file section.

142
00:10:38,063 --> 00:10:39,883
[SPEAKER_01]: Technofiend 3.0 Stepmania 3.9 Release Candidate 2

143
00:11:05,683 --> 00:11:07,444
[SPEAKER_01]: Release Candidate 2A, I think.

144
00:11:07,564 --> 00:11:09,765
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the one that's on stepmania.com.

145
00:11:10,205 --> 00:11:11,246
[SPEAKER_01]: You can download it there.

146
00:11:11,466 --> 00:11:16,708
[SPEAKER_01]: Just get the new upgrade, download that skin, and it's heaven right there.

147
00:11:16,828 --> 00:11:18,829
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all you need to know.

148
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:26,132
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, since this is the first podcast, there might be people listening to this that have no idea what you just said, which is possible.

149
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:32,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, sometimes folks have taken the concept of DDR and built these simulators around it, and Loki...

150
00:11:33,104 --> 00:11:34,365
[SPEAKER_02]: He's our man in the scene.

151
00:11:34,465 --> 00:11:37,466
[SPEAKER_02]: He knows about what's going on, so he's always going to bring you those kinds of updates.

152
00:11:38,087 --> 00:11:41,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, StepMania is the most popular Dance Dance Revolution simulator.

153
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:45,150
[SPEAKER_02]: It's available over at www.stepmania.com.

154
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:49,572
[SPEAKER_02]: But simulators being built for games other than DDR, right?

155
00:11:49,592 --> 00:11:50,993
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other types of simulators out there.

156
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:53,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Any popular recommendations?

157
00:11:54,254 --> 00:11:55,915
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some for Guitar Freaks.

158
00:11:56,575 --> 00:11:57,616
[SPEAKER_01]: That's DTXMania.

159
00:11:59,105 --> 00:12:02,888
[SPEAKER_01]: Step Mania is an all-in-one simulator game.

160
00:12:28,632 --> 00:12:29,693
[SPEAKER_01]: Techno something or other.

161
00:12:29,993 --> 00:12:32,615
[SPEAKER_01]: It's some 8-panel, 9-panel thing that there's like... Technomotion.

162
00:12:32,635 --> 00:12:33,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Technomotion.

163
00:12:33,376 --> 00:12:36,278
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like, what, three of those in the entire world or something?

164
00:12:36,378 --> 00:12:36,739
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

165
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:38,400
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think like two of them are in Las Vegas.

166
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, two of them are in Vegas.

167
00:12:39,881 --> 00:12:40,542
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, whatever.

168
00:12:40,862 --> 00:12:42,283
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's those that are coming.

169
00:12:43,224 --> 00:12:48,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Tons of, you know, games that no one really plays anymore, but, you know...

170
00:12:48,527 --> 00:12:52,468
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be coming to simulator stuff right now, though, if you want to play right now.

171
00:12:52,528 --> 00:12:55,049
[SPEAKER_01]: DTX Mania, which would be one for Drum Mania.

172
00:12:55,449 --> 00:12:59,831
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find tons of information on all these other simulator stuff on the Bomani Style forums.

173
00:12:59,851 --> 00:13:03,092
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually have whole sections dedicated to these simulators.

174
00:13:03,672 --> 00:13:07,534
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really play much Guitar Freaks because I don't have any good controllers for them or anything like that.

175
00:13:08,134 --> 00:13:16,297
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as Beat Mania goes, Delight Delight, Reduplication, and there's Beemania DX is the other good one.

176
00:13:16,846 --> 00:13:17,947
[SPEAKER_01]: So check those out.

177
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:20,688
[SPEAKER_01]: Or BM98, that's another good one to find out.

178
00:13:21,729 --> 00:13:23,550
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's pretty much all that's simulated out there.

179
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:29,434
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's also Feeling Pomo, which is the popping music one, which is supposed to be pretty good.

180
00:13:29,574 --> 00:13:36,038
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, Stepmania 4.0 is supposed to have them all together, and it would be a lot easier than having six different programs.

181
00:13:36,098 --> 00:13:37,539
[SPEAKER_01]: So look for that.

182
00:13:38,928 --> 00:13:40,349
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we'll see what happens there.

183
00:13:40,489 --> 00:13:44,093
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's move on to what's going on in the rest of the gaming world.

184
00:13:44,453 --> 00:13:47,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the gaming world's kind of quiet right now because it's the holidays.

185
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:51,479
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just coming, you know, this is the first week of 2005, so we're just coming off the holidays.

186
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,823
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's not a whole lot kind of new going on, exciting.

187
00:13:56,144 --> 00:14:03,670
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure we're going to start, as the new year comes back, we're going to start hearing a whole lot of stuff right up until E3 because they're going to start dropping little hints here and there.

188
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,452
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll do our best to keep you guys on top of that.

189
00:14:06,181 --> 00:14:09,942
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the meantime, there's sometimes news that you can't control.

190
00:14:10,903 --> 00:14:15,044
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is the news, one of the oldest American ways of business, the lawsuit.

191
00:14:15,444 --> 00:14:17,265
[SPEAKER_02]: But this one's kind of amusing, if you think about it.

192
00:14:17,545 --> 00:14:20,466
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys remember this game that came out this year called The Guy Game?

193
00:14:21,046 --> 00:14:24,288
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was basically Girls Gone Wild in game form.

194
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:26,809
[SPEAKER_02]: You must love this concept, Loki.

195
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:31,310
[SPEAKER_01]: No, this has actually been done like Howard Stern and The Man Show.

196
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:32,971
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's been done before.

197
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,652
[SPEAKER_01]: They basically kind of ripped it off and...

198
00:14:37,065 --> 00:14:38,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Jack with Naked Chicks

199
00:14:48,562 --> 00:14:53,188
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be a good idea, but unfortunately there was one little thing these guys forgot to check.

200
00:14:53,828 --> 00:15:02,038
[SPEAKER_02]: And now what's happened is that Cox News Service last week reported that a young woman, and they're not giving out her name, they're calling her Jane Doe.

201
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:08,366
[SPEAKER_02]: She has filed suit against Take-Two, Sony, and Microsoft because this game was out on PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

202
00:15:09,026 --> 00:15:10,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Take two are the folks that made the game there.

203
00:15:10,687 --> 00:15:14,588
[SPEAKER_02]: They have filed suit because it has footage of her topless.

204
00:15:15,128 --> 00:15:20,050
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was taken during the annual spring break on Texas South Padre Island.

205
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:27,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, okay, that's where they get a lot of these girls to show their assets, so to speak, is at these events by getting them inebriated.

206
00:15:27,533 --> 00:15:29,493
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was one little teeny problem.

207
00:15:30,534 --> 00:15:31,274
[SPEAKER_02]: The girl was only 17.

208
00:15:31,374 --> 00:15:31,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops-doe.

209
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:33,835
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Jane-doe.

210
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:42,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, as a girl, a gamer girl, what do you think of this?

211
00:15:43,747 --> 00:15:48,269
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, I think that showing your boobs for anybody is about the most retarded thing you can do.

212
00:15:48,909 --> 00:15:58,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Being from the South, from where Mardi Gras originated, I think that all those stupid tourists that go to New Orleans to flash their tits for, you know, boom pies, are retarded.

213
00:15:58,814 --> 00:16:00,854
[SPEAKER_03]: And so are all the ones who do the Girls Gone Wild thing.

214
00:16:01,415 --> 00:16:02,075
[SPEAKER_03]: They're sluts.

215
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:03,621
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

216
00:16:21,551 --> 00:16:22,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

217
00:16:51,502 --> 00:16:51,922
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

218
00:16:52,342 --> 00:16:53,583
[SPEAKER_01]: I think her parents should pay for this.

219
00:16:53,623 --> 00:16:56,704
[SPEAKER_01]: They should, you know, make her parents pay for this kind of thing.

220
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:57,404
[SPEAKER_01]: Because guess what?

221
00:16:57,444 --> 00:16:59,584
[SPEAKER_01]: She was, um... I don't know.

222
00:16:59,604 --> 00:17:01,305
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there's laws against that, though.

223
00:17:01,905 --> 00:17:03,946
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's laws against that, and her parents should pay.

224
00:17:05,046 --> 00:17:05,546
[SPEAKER_01]: God damn it.

225
00:17:05,606 --> 00:17:06,746
[SPEAKER_01]: Ruining our entertainment.

226
00:17:07,907 --> 00:17:09,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Always these stupid little hang-ups.

227
00:17:11,188 --> 00:17:12,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, any response to this?

228
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:17,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh... I actually agree with that.

229
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:17,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Stupid.

230
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:18,870
[SPEAKER_03]: She knew where she was going.

231
00:17:19,793 --> 00:17:20,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

232
00:17:38,456 --> 00:17:42,737
[SPEAKER_03]: I told Dan to buy BMX XXX just because I wanted to see what all the crap was in it.

233
00:17:42,777 --> 00:17:45,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I did buy that game and that game is quite nice.

234
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:47,119
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's my thing, okay?

235
00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:53,281
[SPEAKER_01]: With everything that has to do with putting people on film and everything, there's a little thing called a release agreement.

236
00:17:54,585 --> 00:17:56,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Where was that in this, okay?

237
00:17:56,225 --> 00:17:58,786
[SPEAKER_01]: What, they just filmed it and didn't sign a release?

238
00:17:59,126 --> 00:18:00,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Shame on Take-Two.

239
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:05,768
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure she signed a release, but the problem is, if you're under 18, you can't sign the contract.

240
00:18:05,788 --> 00:18:06,808
[SPEAKER_02]: So she probably said she was 18.

241
00:18:07,649 --> 00:18:09,409
[SPEAKER_02]: They just didn't check her ID.

242
00:18:09,729 --> 00:18:14,370
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course, if all you're wearing is panties and nothing else, then you probably don't have your ID on you.

243
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:20,132
[SPEAKER_03]: There still is a thing, even if there was a contract, having taken business law,

244
00:18:21,338 --> 00:18:24,239
[SPEAKER_03]: A contract against a minor is not a binding contract.

245
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:25,840
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a voided contract.

246
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,041
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, legally, yes, she does have the right to sue.

247
00:18:31,362 --> 00:18:33,302
[SPEAKER_02]: But, damn girl, just keep your clothes on.

248
00:18:34,203 --> 00:18:35,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be a slut!

249
00:18:35,603 --> 00:18:36,404
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that easy.

250
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:42,886
[SPEAKER_01]: All I gotta say is, we have the game already in so hot, nothing you can do from me seeing your boobies.

251
00:18:43,086 --> 00:18:43,846
[SPEAKER_01]: I will see them!

252
00:18:45,287 --> 00:18:46,867
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will laugh at my victory.

253
00:18:47,788 --> 00:18:48,748
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a sick man, Loki.

254
00:18:49,156 --> 00:18:54,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly though, the interesting news that comes out of this in the end, this is going to be a collector's game.

255
00:18:55,020 --> 00:19:00,284
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be that original version of Tetris that was on the Nintendo.

256
00:19:00,744 --> 00:19:02,785
[SPEAKER_03]: This will be your first release of Custer's Revenge.

257
00:19:02,805 --> 00:19:04,086
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be Custer's Revenge.

258
00:19:04,206 --> 00:19:05,687
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be that game.

259
00:19:05,787 --> 00:19:07,088
[SPEAKER_03]: This would be X-Man.

260
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:11,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you know the game I'm talking about.

261
00:19:11,211 --> 00:19:11,631
[SPEAKER_02]: I do, I do.

262
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:15,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Where it looks like scissors in a maze except one of those is really his cock.

263
00:19:17,993 --> 00:19:23,757
[SPEAKER_02]: On that note, that's going to do it for this edition, our very first edition of the Orange Lounge Radio podcast.

264
00:19:24,298 --> 00:19:24,998
[SPEAKER_02]: I said cock.

265
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:29,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys for downloading us, and we'll see you next time.

266
00:19:30,882 --> 00:19:33,484
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for subscribing to our podcast.
