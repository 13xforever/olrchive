1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
And now, the Orange Lounge Radio to Go Edition, your internet radio home for discussion on

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,760
rhythm and music gaming and all the news on video games that don't suck.

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,360
And now, here are your hosts, Dark Sakura, Skye, and Loki.

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,600
Hello, everybody, and welcome to the very first Orange Lounge Radio podcast.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,120
I'm your host, Rob Roberts, along with my other host.

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,800
Dark Sakura, the great and terrible.

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,600
And then, of course, we have one more host you guys have all come to know and love.

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,600
And I'm hungry.

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,600
No, I'm looking.

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:43,040
All right, so, Orange Launch Radio, this is going to be the first edition of our podcast.

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,360
So what is this all about?

12
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,760
The Orange Launch Radio podcast, the idea behind this is this great new technology that's

13
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,480
out there on the internet that's basically, you can kind of think of it as an audio blog.

14
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,300
But it's something that you can subscribe to.

15
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,560
So if you're hearing this, you've figured out via our website how to subscribe to our

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,360
podcast and now what you're going to be able to do is that you stay subscribed to our podcast

17
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,520
and about every week or so you're going to get a brand new episode of Orange Lounge Radio

18
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,560
and this is not just rehashed, re-edited stuff that's on our normal 3 hour live talk program.

19
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:19,120
This is an all new program that's made specifically for you to take with you in your pocket everywhere

20
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,920
you go.

21
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,000
Just promise to treat us gently.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,800
So in the end you can basically say, hey I win at the internet.

23
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,800
Exactly.

24
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:32,360
than all your friends, basically. No, but podcasting is an awesome technology. It

25
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,040
really just allows everybody to have a shot at creating all this unique content

26
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,680
out there. So we want to muck it up with our stuff too. So what is

27
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,880
Orange Lounge Radio all about? For those of you guys that may have never heard of

28
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,080
us before, you're hearing about us for the first time due to podcasting.

29
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:52,840
Basically, we are an internet radio station that broadcasts via www.orangeloungeradio.com.

30
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,560
We've been doing this for a couple of years now, and our radio station, which

31
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,500
originally founded behind the concept of rhythm and music video games.

32
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,600
Most common ones everybody thinks about are Konami's Bamani series.

33
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,140
That's Beatmania, Bamani, that was the first game in Konami's series of beat matching games.

34
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,340
There was Beatmania, then we had Dance Dance Revolution, that's the one you guys have all

35
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,220
heard about, certainly.

36
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,380
And then we have other games that came out in that series, Guitar Freaks, Drummania,

37
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,140
Para Para Paradise, all these types of games, right?

38
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,620
And then in the meantime, other folks notice what Konami's doing, and they come out with

39
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,620
their own music games that are pretty good.

40
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:36,300
You've got Amplitude, you've got Frequency, and then you've got Donkey Konga, Taiko Drum

41
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,300
Master now.

42
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,780
And then of course you had the granddaddies of them all, the very first games we saw like

43
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,620
this, one of your favorites.

44
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,620
Right Jamie?

45
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,940
Yeah, my Bust a Move.

46
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,940
Bust a Move.

47
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,780
Now, you get annoyed when people call this Bust a Groove though, right?

48
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:58,900
because best move the only reason why it's best to groove over here is because

49
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,220
Taito has best to move licensed for puzzle bobble which puzzle bobble is a

50
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,780
lot cuter name for the little bubble game because it was bubble bobble and

51
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,280
yet puzzle bobble best to move I'm sorry how do you bust a groove what do you do

52
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,860
just like fill it with something and then hit it with a jackhammer I don't

53
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:20,780
know how can you serve someone I mean it's just in the same same category

54
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,780
Corey right there doesn't make any sense. Whatever.

55
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:28,300
Alright so of course we have this love for music video games because it's how

56
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,420
we all kinda came together because you'll notice if you visit huge websites

57
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,860
dedicated to these games out there things such as ddrfreak.com

58
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:40,100
things such as BamaniStyle, DDR spot and of course OrangeLawnsRadio.com you

59
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,180
notice there's quite a little following to these games

60
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,100
however OrangeLawnsRadio we kinda want to expand we notice that

61
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,780
video gaming while it's addressed out there in the internet radio world

62
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:54,260
it's just not covered quite the way we think we can do it so we like to call

63
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:54,900
ourselves

64
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,660
also video game news about games that don't suck.

65
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:03,020
Which sometimes get fewer and fewer.

66
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,940
You'd be surprised. So there's just so many great new games out there we want

67
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,820
to talk about as well

68
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,460
and you know what, even when a game sometimes does suck, we gotta let you

69
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,820
know about it so you don't buy it.

70
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,300
Like Driver 3.

71
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:19,500
Alright so getting into it, what we want to do here in this episode, let's talk about

72
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,580
about what's going on this week because we want this to be a weekly thing so we're

73
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,820
always going to give you kind of the top stories what's going on. So let's talk

74
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,500
about what's going on in the music gaming world this week. What I want to

75
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,700
talk about is a story that was on ddrfreak.com actually just recently

76
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,700
posted this week and what they're talking about is that Konami is going to

77
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:42,060
showcase over at the Consumer Electronics Show 2005 and Konami is going

78
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,500
to actually feature Dance Dance Revolution at the show from January 6th

79
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,180
through the 9th and they're going to be doing this thing called the cardio play

80
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,900
zone so now of course the Consumer Electronics Show this is something that takes place in

81
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,760
America they're probably going to be selling games such as you know well I mean not literally

82
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,080
selling there at the show but they're going to be pushing games such as DDR Ultra Mix

83
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,300
2, DDR Extreme, things that came out this year but what a really good time to be pushing

84
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,940
this get fit envelope right at the beginning of the year huh?

85
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:15,260
Because everyone's going to be making their new year's resolutions and of course everyone's

86
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,720
going to get in a big frenzy to buy it right there at the beginning of the year so even

87
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,000
And if they lose their momentum later on, they've already made the purchase.

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Exactly.

89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,580
And now you are somebody that actually goes to a gym on a regular basis.

90
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,760
You play DDR for a workout sometimes, but you get your real workout at the gym, right?

91
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,360
Tell me about what happens in January versus what happens in June.

92
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,520
The gym fills up with so many stupid people, like, we're going to work out five million

93
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,000
days a week, and we're going to get fit, and then, of course, a month later, it's back

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,400
to business as usual.

95
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,680
Maybe a couple of them will stay, but you know, that's why for anyone, I say if anyone's

96
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,360
ever going to make that resolution to get fit, start light because you will burn yourself

97
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,800
out, like just about all those other people do at the gym.

98
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,800
Absolutely.

99
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,000
And if you're going to play DDR to get fit, you know, we've talked a lot about on our

100
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,520
three hour program, we've talked a lot about how, you know, folks use DDR in their diet

101
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,680
and things like that.

102
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,200
Just remember to stick with it, okay?

103
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,920
If you're going to play, play on a regular basis and stick with it because I'm speaking

104
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,280
from experience here.

105
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,800
If you stop playing for a while, you lose it.

106
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,640
It's not just the skill you lose, but you lose your stamina and it sucks.

107
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,960
Oh yeah, I can attest to that.

108
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:33,240
See right now I'm working on the first stage of our coverage of the aerobic aspects of

109
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,240
DDR.

110
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,600
I'm working on the fattening up stage, okay?

111
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,640
And then we'll get into the actual gameplay.

112
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,760
I can't say when but at some point we'll start playing again

113
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,760
or at least I'll start playing again and become sexy again

114
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,880
but right now it's just like quasi-sexy

115
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:54,440
so I can't win.

116
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,060
Also what I want to talk about is going on in Bomani News right now this has to do

117
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,120
with DDR UltraMix 2

118
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,840
awesome mix that's out there for the Xbox. They

119
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,400
partnered up with a different drum.com the label there and

120
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,020
just gave a whole new style of music to it. Well,

121
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,580
through the DDR Freak forums, we actually know some of the new songs that are going to be

122
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,580
in downloadable Song Pack 8.

123
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:21,820
So you guys can look forward to these songs. We have Cosmic Cowgirl is going to be in

124
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,820
Song Pack 8. That was the song that was in Guitar Freak. Do you remember that song?

125
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,300
I love that song.

126
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:33,200
Exactly. That was my Drummania song. Cosmic Cowgirl. We have a remix of Kind Lady. We

127
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,480
don't know exactly what the remix title is yet, but there will be a remix of Kind

128
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,100
Lady in the

129
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,620
in the song pack. Another remix of In My Eyes was going to be happening as well

130
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,620
and the Togo project featuring Sana

131
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,860
More Deep version 2.1. This song you might remember was a hidden song in the

132
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,700
Max 2 USA so now it's going to cross over to the Xbox

133
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,940
and this is a really interesting one I thought.

134
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:59,580
If I can even pronounce this right, it's a song from Guitar Freak 6

135
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,740
and Drummania 5 and it's crossing over into DDR. It's

136
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:08,260
Balalakia, Carried with the Wind. You know this one? It's kinda, it's kinda

137
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:11,740
an interesting one. Alright. If you wanna hear those songs in their entirety, we'll

138
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,420
be playing them on Orange Launch Radio at some point,

139
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:19,700
a little bit of a later date. Alright. Now as you know, on Orange Launch Radio, the

140
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,980
program which we have Sunday night, 6.30 Pacific Standard Time, we have this little

141
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,460
segment we like to do called the FUs of the Week.

142
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:29,220
Well, what we've decided to do for this portable version is,

143
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:34,840
You know, Jamie still has a little bit of anger, maybe a little bit, but she's going

144
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,740
to use that anger for the forces of good.

145
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:45,020
And she's going to have her own, so now she's going to have her advice column.

146
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,880
So Jamie, if you would, please tell us your advice column for this week.

147
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:57,260
My first piece of advice for this first podcast is if you have to sign a contract, read the

148
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:02,620
damn thing first don't just sign your name to it and then call customer

149
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,500
service when you don't understand what you've just signed when they bill you

150
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,300
for something and when something goes wrong because you were a big retard and

151
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:14,500
didn't read it always read before you sign I don't care how many damn pages is

152
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:20,100
or if it's in Swahili if it's a contract they have to pay for you to read it you

153
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,820
can get a lawyer just read it first understand what you are signing your

154
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,660
name too cuz the contract is binding and legal unless you're under the age of

155
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,300
majority within your state and then that's another story correct me if I'm

156
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,780
wrong though but if everybody actually read their contracts wouldn't customer

157
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:39,460
service employees be without a job no because people are still fundamentally

158
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:44,820
retarded okay just checking and really now why would you be signing the

159
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:50,580
contract in Swahili I mean that's just retarded what if you're from Africa but

160
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:57,580
it

161
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,540
alright alright

162
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,060
uh... low key tell us what's going on in the sim seen this week for those guys

163
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:07,020
that like to emulate their favorite music games on the computer or i'm sorry

164
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,120
emilate versus simulate i'll get yelled at by somebody for that

165
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,740
simile

166
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:17,140
well really the one big thing because a lot of websites are down because of uh...

167
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,840
different reasons that anyways

168
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:27,340
The big thing that come out this week would be Technofeend 3, which is the brand new StepMania skin, for those who might not know.

169
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:37,340
It was just released, actually, on Bmifestyle.com. You can find it in their downloadable sim file section.

170
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:43,340
It should be, uh, just search for Technofeend Volume 3, or 3.0, and you'll find it there.

171
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,900
there they've included this time around a brand new completely reworked

172
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:52,100
interface it's just so well done it's very professional they even have a note

173
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:57,540
skin to go with it that's pretty sexy but definitely I highly recommend you

174
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:05,960
download it you will need however step mania 3.9 release candidate to release

175
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:11,220
can to a I think it's the one it's on step mania.com you can download it there

176
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:16,980
just get the new upgrade download that skin and it's heaven right there that's

177
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:22,980
all you need to know and again since this is the first podcast there might be

178
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,100
people listening to this have no idea what you just said which is possible

179
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,240
again sometimes folks have taken the concept of DDR and built these

180
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,180
simulators around it and Loki he's our man in the scene he knows about what's

181
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,860
going on so he's always going to bring you those kinds of updates again step

182
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,540
Step Mania is the most popular Dance Dance Revolution simulator, it's available over

183
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,620
at www.stepmania.com.

184
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:49,700
But simulators being built for games other than DDR, right?

185
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:54,380
There's other types of simulators out there, any popular recommendations?

186
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,080
There's some for Guitar Freaks, that's DTX Mania.

187
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:04,260
Now remember that Step Mania is trying to be an all-in-one simulator someday.

188
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:12,120
still working on StepMania 4.0, which is supposed to include game types for BeatMania, BeatMania

189
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:20,280
2DX, Guitar Freaks, DrumMania, Dance Maniacs, Para Para Para, then even some of the ones

190
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:29,320
that aren't even in the Bomani series, like, what was it, I can't remember, Techno something

191
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,680
or other it's it's some eight panel nine panel thing that there's like a motion

192
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,960
second emotion there's like what three of those in the entire world or

193
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,400
something I don't know like two of them are in Las Vegas yeah two of them are in

194
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:45,800
Vegas I mean whatever so there's those they're coming tons of you know games

195
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,400
that no one really plays anymore but you know they're gonna be coming to

196
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,640
simulator stuff right now though if you want to play right now DTX mania which

197
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,480
would be one for drum mania you can find tons of information on all these other

198
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,140
simulator stuff on the Bhumani-style forms. They actually have whole sections dedicated

199
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:05,980
to these simulators. I don't really play much Guitar Freaks because I don't have any good

200
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,900
controllers for them or anything like that. As far as Beatmania goes, Delight Delight

201
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:17,940
Reduplication, and there's Bhumani, or Bemania DX is the other good one. So check those out,

202
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:23,340
or BM98, that's another good one to find out. And that's pretty much all that's simulated

203
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:28,780
out there. I know there's also Feeling Pomo, which is the popping music one, which is supposed

204
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:33,940
to be pretty good. But, like I said, StepMania 4.0 is supposed to have them all together

205
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,500
and it would be a lot easier than having six different programs. So, look for that.

206
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:43,300
Alright, we'll see what happens there. Alright, let's move on to what's going on in the rest

207
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:47,000
of the gaming world. Now, the gaming world is kind of quiet right now because it's the

208
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,700
holidays. We're just coming, you know, it's the first week of 2005, so we're just coming

209
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:56,220
off the holidays so there's not a whole lot kind of new going on exciting and

210
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,340
I'm sure we're going to start as the new year comes back we're going to start

211
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,460
hearing a whole lot of stuff right up until e3 because they're going to start

212
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,900
dropping little hints here and there so we'll do our best to keep you guys on

213
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:09,380
top of that but in the meantime there are sometimes news that you can't

214
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:14,340
control and that is the news one of the oldest American ways of business the

215
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:17,980
lawsuit but this was kind of amusing if you think about it you guys remember

216
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:21,120
Remember this game that came out this year called The Guy Game?

217
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,480
And it was basically Girls Gone Wild in game form.

218
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,240
You must love this concept, Loki.

219
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,640
This has actually been done by Howard Stern and The Man Show.

220
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,320
I know it's been done before.

221
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,880
They basically kind of ripped it off and tried to come up with it.

222
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,560
It's almost like you don't know Jack with naked chicks.

223
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:52,680
It would be a good idea, but unfortunately there was one little thing these guys forgot

224
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:58,000
to check, and now what's happened is that Cox News Service last week reported that a

225
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,160
young woman, and they're not giving out her name, they're calling her Jane Doe.

226
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,180
She has filed suit against Take-Two, Sony, and Microsoft, because this game was out on

227
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,180
PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

228
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,760
Take-Two are the folks that made the game there.

229
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:16,380
have filed suit because it has footage of her topless and this was taken during

230
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:21,180
the annual spring break on Texas South Padre Island well okay that's where they

231
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:26,180
get a lot of these girls to show their assets so to speak is that these events

232
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:30,980
by getting them inebriated but there was one little teeny problem the girl was

233
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:40,780
only 17 oops dough no Jane Jane Doe oopsie Jamie what he as as a girl a gamer

234
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:45,820
girl what do you think of this first of all I think that showing your boobs for

235
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,740
anybody is about the most retarded thing you can do well being from the south

236
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,820
from where Mardi Gras originated I think that all those stupid tourists that go

237
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:59,020
to New Orleans to flash their tits for you know boom pies are retarded and so

238
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:04,400
are all the ones who do the Girls Gone Wild thing. They're sluts. They're easy. They obviously

239
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,500
have a poor self-image because they feel the need to show their boobies to make themselves

240
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,500
be appreciated.

241
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,180
and we appreciate them now

242
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:16,840
I know it's great though is I love they have like other lawsuits similar to

243
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,960
this type of thing that's not necessarily video game related but

244
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:25,960
if like do like I know that they were filming for this video at this party

245
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,560
oh you didn't know by going to the girls gone wild party

246
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,640
that they're gonna be filling for the video

247
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,200
what you think is going on there seriously it's retarded

248
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,280
I mean it was spring break okay so they're flat she's flashing your tits

249
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:41,920
out there

250
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,400
oh my god guess what they recorded it og

251
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,920
well she must be really concerned about that when she went out in front of like

252
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,040
thousands of people

253
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,000
flasher tits you know what I think your parents should pay for this station

254
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,440
you know maker parents pay for this can think this guess what she was a

255
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,560
I don't know I'm sure there's laws against that though I know there's laws

256
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,020
against that her parents should pay

257
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:11,020
Goddamnit, ruining our entertainment. Always these stupid little hang-ups.

258
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,020
Jamie, any response to this?

259
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:19,020
Uh, I actually agree with that. Stupid, she knew where she was going.

260
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,020
She probably did it just to make the lawsuit.

261
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:29,020
Who knows, but would you ever let a guy that you were dating, what would you think if they were, of course you, you know,

262
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:32,020
folks that listen to Orange on this Radio know that you've been in a long-term relationship for some time,

263
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,660
time. Would you let the boyfriend play the guy game?

264
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:41,300
Why not? I think they're fucking hilarious. I told Dan to buy BMX XXX just because I wanted

265
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,500
to see what all the crap was in it. No, I did buy that game and that game is

266
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:49,920
quite nice. But here's my thing, okay? With everything that has to do with putting people

267
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:55,220
on film and everything, there's a little thing called a release agreement. Where was that

268
00:17:55,220 --> 00:18:01,060
in this, okay? What, they just filmed it and didn't sign a release? Shame on take two.

269
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:04,540
I'm sure she signed a release but the problem is you can't if you're under 18

270
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,260
you can't sign the contract so she probably said she was 18

271
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:11,740
they just didn't check her ID but of course if all you're wearing is panties

272
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,460
and nothing else then you probably don't have your ID on you

273
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,780
there still is a thing even if there was a

274
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:23,180
contract having taken business law a contract against a minor is not a

275
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,980
binding contract it is avoided contract

276
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,100
and so legally yes she does have the right to sue

277
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:34,460
But, damn girl, just keep your clothes on.

278
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,540
Don't be a slut, it's that easy.

279
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:42,300
All I gotta say is, we have the game already and so ha, nothing you can do from me seeing

280
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,300
your boobies.

281
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,340
I will see them!

282
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,860
And I will laugh at my victory.

283
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,220
You're a sick man, Loki.

284
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:53,820
Honestly though, the interesting news that comes out of this in the end, this is going

285
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,100
to be a collector's game.

286
00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:00,860
This will be that original version of Tetris that was on the Nintendo.

287
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,620
This would be your first release of Custer's Revenge.

288
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,320
This will be Custer's Revenge.

289
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,860
This will be that game.

290
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,860
This would be X-Man.

291
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:14,020
Yes, you know the game I'm talking about, where it looks like Scissors in a Maze except

292
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:18,020
one of those is really his cock.

293
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:22,440
On that note, that's going to do it for this edition, our very first edition of the Orange

294
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:42,880
Thank you guys for downloading us, and we'll see you next time.
