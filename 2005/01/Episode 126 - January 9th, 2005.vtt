04:30.061 --> 04:30.561
Oh, God.

04:30.581 --> 04:31.862
[SPEAKER_21]: Call me Daddy.

04:51.253 --> 04:54.755

[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

04:59.818 --> 05:02.919
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

05:03.640 --> 05:10.083
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge may contain plenty of... Just kidding.

05:10.183 --> 05:13.905
[SPEAKER_27]: Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.

05:14.005 --> 05:15.406
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, isn't that special?

05:20.408 --> 05:38.940
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio Live is a fully interactive program via our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com And now, here are your hosts for Orange Lounge Radio Live, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

05:41.142 --> 05:43.804
[SPEAKER_28]: We are live!

05:44.824 --> 05:46.445
[SPEAKER_28]: And this is episode number 126 for this

05:49.651 --> 05:52.152
[SPEAKER_28]: January the 9th of 2005.

05:52.713 --> 05:59.877
[SPEAKER_28]: You're tuned into the B... Money Scenes.

06:00.877 --> 06:02.878
[SPEAKER_28]: Most minty station of all things money.

06:03.939 --> 06:05.099
[SPEAKER_28]: My name is Rob Roberts.

06:05.139 --> 06:06.680
[SPEAKER_28]: You might know me as Sky.

06:07.521 --> 06:09.782
[SPEAKER_28]: Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts.

06:09.962 --> 06:11.823
[SPEAKER_28]: In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm.

06:11.923 --> 06:13.644
[SPEAKER_28]: Say hello to DarkSakura.

06:13.664 --> 06:15.325
[SPEAKER_28]: You know her maybe as Jamie Summers.

06:16.385 --> 06:16.786
[SPEAKER_09]: I like fire.

06:18.550 --> 06:19.751
[SPEAKER_28]: Fire is very cool.

06:19.811 --> 06:20.432
[SPEAKER_28]: I do like fire.

06:20.512 --> 06:22.694
[SPEAKER_09]: I watched Mr. Show today.

06:23.834 --> 06:26.216
[SPEAKER_28]: What have you set on fire this week, Jamie?

06:26.257 --> 06:26.977
[SPEAKER_28]: Just out of curiosity.

06:26.997 --> 06:27.417
[SPEAKER_09]: Candles.

06:27.898 --> 06:28.138
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, okay.

06:28.378 --> 06:29.399
[SPEAKER_09]: They smelled like pears.

06:29.519 --> 06:30.140
[SPEAKER_28]: That's something.

06:31.501 --> 06:33.282
[SPEAKER_09]: I played Sunday Money this week.

06:33.643 --> 06:36.845
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, we're going to get into that definitely when we get into How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.

06:36.986 --> 06:38.227
[SPEAKER_28]: You should light a pear on fire.

06:38.267 --> 06:39.047
[SPEAKER_28]: I wonder what that would do.

06:40.048 --> 06:43.791
[SPEAKER_09]: It wouldn't catch fire because of the moisture in the pear.

06:44.512 --> 06:45.753
[SPEAKER_09]: You catch the stem on fire, maybe.

06:46.283 --> 06:51.206
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, if you threw it in the fireplace, that might be like a lot of fire where the moisture would put it out.

06:51.266 --> 06:53.467
[SPEAKER_09]: But not enough.

06:53.528 --> 06:59.951
[SPEAKER_09]: It would still... Seriously?

07:01.132 --> 07:02.693
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm full of good ideas here.

07:02.733 --> 07:05.455
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, we're going to have roasted pears with butter and cinnamon.

07:06.275 --> 07:07.256
[SPEAKER_09]: Stay on Iron Chef.

07:07.276 --> 07:07.876
[SPEAKER_09]: We're a battle.

07:07.916 --> 07:08.577
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm a genius.

07:09.677 --> 07:13.580
[SPEAKER_28]: Also joining us, the other co-host, you know him...

07:14.485 --> 07:17.426
[SPEAKER_28]: The angry, the bitter, the tech massa, Loki!

07:19.627 --> 07:19.827
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

07:23.368 --> 07:27.270
[SPEAKER_28]: And we never say his stage name, but it's Matt Blackman, by the way.

07:27.630 --> 07:28.670
[SPEAKER_28]: Just in case you were curious.

07:28.730 --> 07:29.010
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

07:30.811 --> 07:33.232
[SPEAKER_28]: Also joining us tonight, we have one special guest.

07:33.632 --> 07:36.993
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, actually we have two, but one of them never talks, so we just don't acknowledge her.

07:38.170 --> 07:38.590
[SPEAKER_09]: DDRAngel

08:06.363 --> 08:06.663
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

08:06.964 --> 08:07.104
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah.

08:09.566 --> 08:10.927
[SPEAKER_10]: I almost killed myself with the cord.

08:11.147 --> 08:11.268
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah!

08:11.928 --> 08:15.712
[SPEAKER_28]: Those that know her pretty well, though, know that she's actually DDR Devil.

08:16.993 --> 08:17.934
[SPEAKER_10]: Bastard, I am not.

08:20.476 --> 08:21.057
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, great.

08:21.617 --> 08:24.079
[SPEAKER_28]: There's the devil right there in ferret form.

08:24.820 --> 08:25.921
[SPEAKER_10]: So, do I have a name yet?

08:28.483 --> 08:28.864
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you?

08:29.024 --> 08:29.364
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know.

08:29.424 --> 08:30.045
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you have a name?

08:31.963 --> 08:32.384
[SPEAKER_10]: Tell me.

08:32.484 --> 08:33.186
[SPEAKER_10]: Just Angel.

08:33.526 --> 08:34.428
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, it's just Angel.

08:34.468 --> 08:34.729
[SPEAKER_10]: Fine.

08:35.089 --> 08:35.971
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have a label anymore.

08:36.011 --> 08:36.973
[SPEAKER_28]: Angel of the morning.

08:37.133 --> 08:38.376
[SPEAKER_28]: I like Angel Devilman.

08:40.340 --> 08:41.141
[SPEAKER_28]: Or Deviled Angel.

08:41.181 --> 08:43.285
[SPEAKER_28]: I like those paradoxes.

08:43.345 --> 08:43.546
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyway.

08:44.600 --> 08:48.944
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, we got a fun show for you tonight.

08:49.024 --> 08:49.724
[SPEAKER_28]: Actually, we don't.

08:49.744 --> 08:52.446
[SPEAKER_28]: We have a mediocre show, but it's packaged as a good show.

08:52.527 --> 08:55.509
[SPEAKER_28]: No, it's going to be a good show as always.

08:56.169 --> 08:57.230
[SPEAKER_28]: Lots of things to talk about.

08:57.871 --> 09:03.115
[SPEAKER_28]: As Jamie mentioned there, she's actually played some Bomani this week, so we got to talk about that, among other Bomani things.

09:03.896 --> 09:06.338
[SPEAKER_28]: Huge Bomani news going on in the scene this week.

09:06.358 --> 09:07.479
[SPEAKER_28]: We got to talk about this.

09:07.499 --> 09:08.479
[SPEAKER_28]: You know this is going to be big.

09:09.100 --> 09:12.823
[SPEAKER_28]: Also, we want to talk about the brand new...

09:13.800 --> 09:15.341
[SPEAKER_28]: Orange Lounge Radio Production.

09:15.361 --> 09:16.781
[SPEAKER_28]: There's a brand new show.

09:17.221 --> 09:18.722
[SPEAKER_28]: You may not have even heard of this yet.

09:18.742 --> 09:20.002
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to tell you guys all about it.

09:20.062 --> 09:20.723
[SPEAKER_28]: It's so cool.

09:21.583 --> 09:22.803
[SPEAKER_28]: All of that when we get back from this break.

09:22.823 --> 09:23.824
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called Fun With Butter.

09:25.844 --> 09:26.365
[SPEAKER_28]: That's right.

09:26.525 --> 09:27.545
[SPEAKER_28]: It's Fun With Butter.

09:28.085 --> 09:33.127
[SPEAKER_28]: And we just take DDR Angel and we just douse her in butter and then cook her.

09:34.948 --> 09:35.428
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, shit.

09:35.468 --> 09:36.728
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you going to light me on fire?

09:38.369 --> 09:38.549
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

09:40.060 --> 09:43.022
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's have DDR Angel hold pears and then set it on fire.

09:43.042 --> 09:44.383
[SPEAKER_28]: We're being very random tonight.

09:45.803 --> 09:47.784
[SPEAKER_10]: Let my blackmates light you on fire.

09:48.625 --> 09:49.005
[SPEAKER_26]: All right.

09:49.485 --> 09:51.646
[SPEAKER_26]: It's going to be one of those shows, folks.

09:51.807 --> 09:53.267
[SPEAKER_26]: One of those shows.

09:53.948 --> 09:54.268
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

09:55.008 --> 09:58.310
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll talk about all that fun stuff when we come back from this break.

09:58.954 --> 10:07.918
[SPEAKER_28]: In this break, we're going to feature music from 2DX, but Jamie requested that we play some 2DX songs that you don't normally hear us play.

10:08.338 --> 10:11.079
[SPEAKER_28]: So these are underappreciated 2DX songs.

10:11.400 --> 10:15.821
[SPEAKER_28]: And we're going to start it off with a little ditty from Slake called I'm For Real.

10:15.861 --> 10:16.782
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll be back after this.

10:18.663 --> 10:19.103
I'm For Real

11:52.543 --> 11:54.165
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

13:24.733 --> 13:25.219
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

14:32.245 --> 14:33.167
Thanks for watching!

15:59.631 --> 16:02.912
[SPEAKER_14]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

16:02.972 --> 16:07.074
[SPEAKER_14]: Rhythm and music gaming and video games that don't suck.

16:07.174 --> 16:07.975
[SPEAKER_13]: And some that do.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.449
[SPEAKER_28]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

16:44.500 --> 16:47.282
[SPEAKER_28]: Is it just me, or I kind of feel what they're saying.

16:47.302 --> 16:50.465
[SPEAKER_28]: There's a lot of real elitist 2DX players out there.

16:50.745 --> 16:54.008
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, now, I've always been one that says, you know, just play the damn game.

16:54.248 --> 16:55.229
[SPEAKER_28]: Just have fun with the game.

16:55.790 --> 16:57.031
[SPEAKER_28]: That's why they make it for the home.

16:57.071 --> 16:58.592
[SPEAKER_28]: You can play in the privacy of your own home.

16:58.652 --> 17:03.356
[SPEAKER_28]: Mostly arcades don't even have the game anyway, so you don't have to be intimidated or worry about anything.

17:03.416 --> 17:04.717
[SPEAKER_28]: But what's up with that?

17:04.757 --> 17:06.579
[SPEAKER_28]: Why do people get elitist over 2DX?

17:06.839 --> 17:07.379
[SPEAKER_28]: Any ideas?

17:09.621 --> 17:09.801
[SPEAKER_28]: No?

17:10.101 --> 17:10.842
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie, any thoughts?

17:11.683 --> 17:11.903
[SPEAKER_09]: This is...

17:12.230 --> 17:18.334
[SPEAKER_09]: Because people have to have something to feel good about themselves, and if they suck at everything else in life, they have to at least be good at 2DX, I don't know.

17:19.414 --> 17:32.662
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, no, I know some good 2DX players that don't suck at life, they're very good at life, and they just happen to be good at 2DX too, but some people, man, it's like, I don't know, instead of having a humongous internet penis, they feel the need to have a humongous 2DX penis.

17:33.663 --> 17:35.944
[SPEAKER_28]: And this, you know, this could be a girl too, don't, you know.

17:36.772 --> 17:39.493
[SPEAKER_28]: Although I actually don't know a whole lot of girls that play 2DX.

17:39.533 --> 17:42.453
[SPEAKER_28]: I know some, and some that are quite good, like Jamie.

17:42.793 --> 17:43.713
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie plays 2DX.

17:44.274 --> 17:45.314
[SPEAKER_28]: Angel plays a little 2DX.

17:47.194 --> 17:47.814
[SPEAKER_28]: I am not good.

17:47.854 --> 17:53.655
[SPEAKER_28]: But see, that's the whole thing right there, is that you feel like you're not good compared to what?

17:55.756 --> 17:57.216
[SPEAKER_09]: Compared to other people in general?

17:57.316 --> 18:04.098
[SPEAKER_28]: You know what, but any old person walking up the street, if you were to play 2DX for that person, they'd probably go, wow, she's hitting a lot of buttons.

18:04.398 --> 18:05.418
[SPEAKER_09]: It's relative, but I'm...

18:06.365 --> 18:11.289
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, my skill has depreciated a bit at the game, just with lack of practice.

18:11.930 --> 18:13.151
[SPEAKER_28]: So has mine, oh my gosh.

18:13.591 --> 18:19.115
[SPEAKER_28]: Tell you what, if you don't keep practicing these music games, these rhythm beat games, you'll lose it.

18:19.556 --> 18:20.396
[SPEAKER_28]: Boy, do you ever.

18:20.757 --> 18:21.217
[SPEAKER_28]: It's sad.

18:21.958 --> 18:31.165
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, anyway, let's not get too off topic because we've got to start off tonight's show as we start off every week's show playing a little game, and that game is How was your week?

18:31.385 --> 18:32.046
[SPEAKER_28]: How was your day?

18:32.967 --> 18:34.088
[SPEAKER_28]: Dark Sakura, how was your week?

18:34.108 --> 18:34.468
[SPEAKER_28]: How was your day?

18:34.781 --> 18:35.742
[SPEAKER_09]: I played some 2DX.

18:36.903 --> 18:39.205
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, then you can't beat that out of practice.

18:39.225 --> 18:48.753
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, just a little, but my week's been, it's been a really fucked up week because this is my second to last week at my job.

18:49.434 --> 18:52.357
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I got promoted, going back to where I was before.

18:52.477 --> 18:53.197
[SPEAKER_28]: Congratulations.

18:53.297 --> 18:53.638
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

18:53.898 --> 18:55.019
[SPEAKER_09]: Get a nice raise out of it, too.

18:55.159 --> 18:56.280
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, raises rock.

18:58.627 --> 19:02.010
[SPEAKER_28]: Now you can buy more useless video game garbage you'll only play one time.

19:02.170 --> 19:03.812
[SPEAKER_09]: This money is getting saved up for my house.

19:04.632 --> 19:08.576
[SPEAKER_28]: So you can have more places to keep all your useless video games.

19:08.856 --> 19:09.877
[SPEAKER_09]: Precisely.

19:10.177 --> 19:11.798
[SPEAKER_28]: None of your stuff is useless though, Jamie.

19:11.818 --> 19:12.779
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm talking in general.

19:13.039 --> 19:17.743
[SPEAKER_28]: I would never make fun of the DarkSakura Museum of Video Gaming.

19:18.264 --> 19:21.686
[SPEAKER_09]: Museum is right, although it's all in boxes most of the places.

19:22.067 --> 19:23.568
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to be getting rid of a lot of our toys soon.

19:24.829 --> 19:25.790
[SPEAKER_28]: Are you going to put it on eBay?

19:26.169 --> 19:28.511
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we're probably just going to give them away to some charity or something.

19:28.631 --> 19:29.112
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm charity.

19:30.713 --> 19:33.636
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, do you want a bunch of Ronin Warriors and Exo Squad toys?

19:33.816 --> 19:34.796
[SPEAKER_28]: I would never.

19:34.837 --> 19:39.360
[SPEAKER_09]: They re-released a bunch of the Macross toys as Exo Squad toys, and we have them.

19:41.642 --> 19:43.544
[SPEAKER_28]: We should give them away as prizes on the show.

19:43.564 --> 19:45.005
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I did!

19:45.145 --> 19:48.548
[SPEAKER_09]: I did manage to get more V-Rares.

19:49.189 --> 19:52.732
[SPEAKER_09]: More copies of the EX and Ultra Mix V-Rares.

19:53.840 --> 20:02.122
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have three of each, and maybe doing something with those as far as prize-related things.

20:03.262 --> 20:03.462
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

20:03.902 --> 20:05.682
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse me.

20:06.122 --> 20:13.284
[SPEAKER_09]: I've also had this burning spot at the back of my throat, just like a little rough spot, so my voice has been kind of, uh, all day.

20:13.944 --> 20:14.884
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw The Grudge again.

20:15.664 --> 20:16.044
[SPEAKER_25]: How was that?

20:16.104 --> 20:16.524
[SPEAKER_09]: In the theater.

20:17.244 --> 20:20.065
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it would have been great, except for the morons talking behind us, so...

20:20.618 --> 20:25.220
[SPEAKER_09]: My friend turns around, this is at the Sunrise Theater, she turns around and says, do you want me to beat you in the head?

20:26.581 --> 20:28.582
[SPEAKER_28]: That was almost like my experience when I went and saw The Grudge.

20:28.702 --> 20:30.282
[SPEAKER_09]: This was right at the beginning of the movie.

20:30.622 --> 20:32.403
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh no, this was towards the end when I saw it.

20:33.544 --> 20:42.448
[SPEAKER_28]: And there was this guy, this like jock guy sitting in the back going, and I turn around and go, well the guy with the little penis in the back row, please shut up.

20:43.783 --> 20:46.965
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there was this one kid that just started belching in the last half of the movie.

20:47.485 --> 20:50.808
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, wow, it must be special to be able to burp in a movie.

20:50.828 --> 20:51.948
[SPEAKER_09]: Only retards do that.

20:52.809 --> 20:54.130
[SPEAKER_09]: And so he stopped.

20:55.170 --> 20:58.353
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just a little... His mom was there, too.

20:59.593 --> 21:02.755
[SPEAKER_09]: So I felt like making a comment about how she raised her children.

21:02.815 --> 21:04.196
[SPEAKER_26]: Isn't your mother proud of you now?

21:06.838 --> 21:07.599
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway...

21:08.897 --> 21:10.698
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just been a very weird week.

21:10.758 --> 21:17.843
[SPEAKER_09]: And like Friday was also my boss's boss, who is the AVP in our department, her last day.

21:18.744 --> 21:23.828
[SPEAKER_09]: And we just ended up talking about stuff in general about... How last days rock.

21:24.628 --> 21:28.271
[SPEAKER_09]: About our opinion of certain people, you know.

21:28.731 --> 21:30.873
[SPEAKER_09]: And just in general, and I hardly touched the phone.

21:30.913 --> 21:32.033
[SPEAKER_09]: I took like 20 calls all day.

21:32.934 --> 21:33.955
[SPEAKER_09]: I ate carrot cake.

21:36.096 --> 21:38.358
[SPEAKER_09]: And I did body sculpting for the first time on Tuesday.

21:39.190 --> 21:42.391
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was so sore, but I was like, Mom, I'm going to go spin the next day.

21:42.411 --> 21:44.731
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to be a good little workoutaholic.

21:45.671 --> 21:47.212
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my God, I was in such pain.

21:47.672 --> 21:48.372
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't go Thursday.

21:48.692 --> 21:49.372
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't go Friday.

21:49.552 --> 21:50.712
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't go yesterday.

21:51.333 --> 21:52.193
[SPEAKER_09]: I did crap.

21:52.533 --> 21:53.813
[SPEAKER_28]: That's like my DDR diet.

21:53.873 --> 21:56.294
[SPEAKER_28]: I played like four days in a row, and then I didn't play for five.

21:56.454 --> 21:57.354
[SPEAKER_28]: And then I played yesterday.

21:58.394 --> 21:59.674
[SPEAKER_09]: I played PSO last night.

22:00.474 --> 22:01.295
[SPEAKER_09]: And on the internet.

22:01.975 --> 22:02.815
[SPEAKER_09]: And went to TapX.

22:04.135 --> 22:07.616
[SPEAKER_09]: I went to the new TapX on... There's a new TapX?

22:08.095 --> 22:09.396
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell, no, on Hell.

22:12.397 --> 22:14.899
[SPEAKER_09]: It intersects with Hell off of Fair Oaks.

22:14.979 --> 22:15.919
[SPEAKER_09]: Off Fair Oaks, actually.

22:16.699 --> 22:17.760
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, I didn't even know there was a new one.

22:17.800 --> 22:19.681
[SPEAKER_09]: It's tucked away back there, but they have fish balls on the menu.

22:20.121 --> 22:24.924
[SPEAKER_09]: And they have real spring rolls, like the Vietnamese-style spring rolls, with the thin wraps.

22:25.084 --> 22:28.786
[SPEAKER_25]: For those that don't have Tap-X, what's Tap-X, for those that may not know?

22:28.826 --> 22:29.426
[SPEAKER_09]: Tapioca Express.

22:29.786 --> 22:35.409
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically, you can get all kinds of tea, juices, and milk tea, coffee...

22:35.854 --> 22:36.434
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

23:04.727 --> 23:07.988
[SPEAKER_28]: In fact, Angel's got some balls... Kind of sticky and squishy.

23:08.108 --> 23:09.948
[SPEAKER_28]: Angel's got some balls mints with her right now.

23:09.968 --> 23:11.088
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll have to put these on cam.

23:12.849 --> 23:15.949
[SPEAKER_28]: So I can put Angel's balls in my mouth, which I think I'm going to do right now.

23:16.910 --> 23:20.110
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to look politely in the other direction.

23:20.290 --> 23:21.230
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, look, ferret!

23:24.671 --> 23:26.292
[SPEAKER_26]: Anything else you want to share about your week and your day?

23:27.292 --> 23:28.332
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, no.

23:28.572 --> 23:28.752
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

23:31.513 --> 23:32.813
[SPEAKER_28]: Alrighty, let's move on to Loki!

23:32.853 --> 23:33.233
[SPEAKER_28]: Loki!

23:34.332 --> 23:35.693
[SPEAKER_28]: Logi, how was your week?

23:35.713 --> 23:36.333
[SPEAKER_28]: How was your day, Logi?

23:37.794 --> 23:38.674
[SPEAKER_24]: My week was alright.

23:39.074 --> 23:40.755
[SPEAKER_24]: I've been buying stuff.

23:41.996 --> 23:45.037
[SPEAKER_24]: Stuff for my project, my other project.

23:45.337 --> 23:48.639
[SPEAKER_24]: Because, you know, all the other projects I start without finishing the other ones.

23:49.659 --> 23:52.180
[SPEAKER_24]: But this one should be done pretty quick, though, because it's a small one.

23:53.641 --> 23:58.543
[SPEAKER_24]: But everything to build my micro-ITX PC that's going to be inside of an Xbox.

23:59.664 --> 24:01.285
[SPEAKER_24]: That's going to be for our roadshows.

24:02.586 --> 24:03.207
[SPEAKER_24]: So I have it all.

24:03.367 --> 24:05.450
[SPEAKER_24]: Right now most of it is stacked on that table right there.

24:07.714 --> 24:09.637
[SPEAKER_24]: But everything else is still coming in for it.

24:09.777 --> 24:11.640
[SPEAKER_24]: The only thing I have left to purchase on is Ram.

24:12.100 --> 24:12.501
[SPEAKER_24]: And then...

24:14.085 --> 24:42.380
[SPEAKER_24]: Any other peripherals that plug into it And then, you know, any other miscellaneous case modding crap I want to do to it So I have that And then, this week I've been playing a lot of Final Fantasy That type of stuff Also been playing a lot of the Guy game, actually Which is quite funny Because it's a fun trivia game with boobies in it And, let's see what else Oh, just, you know, watched a few movies And that kind of thing

24:43.576 --> 24:44.856
[SPEAKER_24]: Overall, pretty easy week.

24:46.077 --> 24:50.538
[SPEAKER_24]: And, um... Yeah, that's all that's pretty much been going on.

24:50.958 --> 24:51.698
[SPEAKER_24]: Just that kind of stuff.

24:58.680 --> 25:04.621
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, and my week and my day was, um... Okay, I guess I had a very lazy day.

25:04.741 --> 25:06.582
[SPEAKER_28]: I've had a very lazy weekend, come to think of it.

25:06.922 --> 25:08.322
[SPEAKER_28]: I really done crap this weekend.

25:08.342 --> 25:10.262
[SPEAKER_28]: I played a lot of Final Fantasy, that's for sure.

25:11.343 --> 25:11.863
[SPEAKER_09]: Addict!

25:12.003 --> 25:12.363
[SPEAKER_28]: Whatever.

25:14.913 --> 25:19.977
[SPEAKER_28]: That's alright, we've sucked DDR Angel into our little addiction and soon you will be next.

25:19.997 --> 25:23.240
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I tried that little addiction, you know what?

25:23.780 --> 25:25.481
[SPEAKER_09]: It was crap, so I stopped playing.

25:25.581 --> 25:27.703
[SPEAKER_28]: As long as you didn't ditch us for World of Warcraft.

25:28.504 --> 25:30.385
[SPEAKER_10]: Should we tell her about the character problem?

25:30.645 --> 25:30.905
[SPEAKER_10]: Oops.

25:33.687 --> 25:36.970
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyway, let's see, what else was I going to say?

25:36.990 --> 25:37.070
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

25:38.024 --> 25:38.985
[SPEAKER_28]: Death's the best part

26:06.816 --> 26:08.554
[SPEAKER_28]: well, not when you're the one that's dying

26:09.431 --> 26:15.533
[SPEAKER_28]: When you're killing other people, it's okay, but I was the one that kept dying, so... I don't know, I just went back into Final Fantasy XI where I don't die as much.

26:16.794 --> 26:21.915
[SPEAKER_28]: But I got to play Halo 2 last night, and I forgot that it actually can be a lot of fun when you're killing your friends.

26:22.536 --> 26:36.901
[SPEAKER_28]: So, I need to, like, have a Halo 2 night or something, where I set aside a night and play Halo 2, because it's much more fun to play with your friends than it is to play strangers on Xbox Live, who are, like, a gazillion times better than you are, and just get on there and say...

26:38.021 --> 26:40.423
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm gonna shoot you down, faggot.

26:40.523 --> 26:41.503
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm gonna kill you.

26:43.145 --> 26:45.126
[SPEAKER_16]: Nigga, I'm the best one at this game.

26:47.087 --> 26:49.849
[SPEAKER_28]: And I swear, people on Xbox Live, they talk just like that.

26:49.889 --> 26:51.010
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm not even exaggerating.

26:51.070 --> 26:54.112
[SPEAKER_28]: So if you're offended by what I said, just go on Xbox Live.

26:54.152 --> 26:54.573
[SPEAKER_28]: It's worse.

26:57.455 --> 27:00.357
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyway, what else is going on?

27:00.657 --> 27:00.977
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know.

27:01.017 --> 27:03.919
[SPEAKER_28]: I was kind of hoping to do a little bit of traveling this weekend, but that didn't happen.

27:03.959 --> 27:06.501
[SPEAKER_28]: But next weekend is a three-day weekend.

27:07.316 --> 27:11.819
[SPEAKER_28]: So I don't know if it's going to be a drunk show Sunday night or if I'm going to go out after the show next Sunday.

27:12.819 --> 27:14.220
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll drink if someone can get me home.

27:14.981 --> 27:15.401
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see.

27:15.421 --> 27:16.241
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll have to see what we can do.

27:16.361 --> 27:17.662
[SPEAKER_28]: But it's a three-day weekend for me next week.

27:17.702 --> 27:18.683
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm playing hooky on Friday, too.

27:18.963 --> 27:20.664
[SPEAKER_28]: Our work celebrates Martin Luther King Day.

27:21.104 --> 27:22.065
[SPEAKER_28]: So we get it off.

27:22.425 --> 27:22.905
[SPEAKER_28]: It's pretty cool.

27:24.226 --> 27:26.067
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, speaking of that, if I can add one more thing.

27:26.487 --> 27:26.808
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

27:27.028 --> 27:29.029
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to the Skywalker Ranch on Friday.

27:29.869 --> 27:30.390
[SPEAKER_28]: What for?

27:30.890 --> 27:32.371
[SPEAKER_09]: My friend works for LucasArts.

27:33.843 --> 27:35.264
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to do school stuff that morning.

27:35.284 --> 27:37.704
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm playing hooky anyway on Friday, on my last day.

27:38.345 --> 27:40.305
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to the Skywalker Ranch for lunch.

27:41.226 --> 27:43.667
[SPEAKER_28]: You should take some business cards.

27:44.927 --> 27:45.687
[SPEAKER_09]: Give me some business cards.

27:45.707 --> 27:46.168
[SPEAKER_28]: We can find some.

27:46.208 --> 27:46.888
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, anyway.

27:46.908 --> 27:48.509
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I just wanted to throw that in.

27:48.529 --> 27:50.989
[SPEAKER_28]: Whoring out Orange Lounge Radio everywhere we can.

27:52.690 --> 27:55.531
[SPEAKER_28]: I guess that's all I really have to say about my week and my day, and not a whole lot.

27:55.651 --> 27:56.552
[SPEAKER_28]: I did see some movies.

27:57.232 --> 28:01.053
[SPEAKER_28]: I saw that movie Finding Neverland, which is kind of like an artsy film that's up for Golden Globes.

28:01.533 --> 28:01.994
[SPEAKER_28]: Very good.

28:02.474 --> 28:02.994
[SPEAKER_28]: Very good film.

28:03.447 --> 28:04.807
[SPEAKER_28]: If you like Johnny Depp, you'll like this movie.

28:05.748 --> 28:06.288
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, that's it.

28:07.228 --> 28:08.068
[SPEAKER_28]: Enough of me, I'm boring.

28:08.629 --> 28:09.349
[SPEAKER_28]: Angel, how was your week?

28:09.389 --> 28:09.749
[SPEAKER_28]: How was your day?

28:10.649 --> 28:11.950
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm even more boring, so there.

28:12.290 --> 28:14.530
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me.

28:15.070 --> 28:15.431
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

28:16.971 --> 28:23.353
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I guess for the gaggy part of my week, because I know you guys are all going to gag and go, oh, not.

28:24.913 --> 28:27.774
[SPEAKER_10]: Magus and I celebrated our two year anniversary, so yay.

28:29.935 --> 28:30.035
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh!

28:31.584 --> 28:32.224
[SPEAKER_10]: See, he told you.

28:32.645 --> 28:35.987
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, I also played a lot of Final Fantasy XI.

28:36.027 --> 28:37.148
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Rob.

28:37.828 --> 28:38.228
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey!

28:41.350 --> 28:43.512
[SPEAKER_10]: And, yeah, signed up for school.

28:44.092 --> 28:45.313
[SPEAKER_10]: Ow, that was expensive.

28:45.513 --> 28:45.933
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh well.

28:46.634 --> 28:48.635
[SPEAKER_10]: Not as expensive as Jamie's, I'm sure, but still.

28:51.037 --> 28:52.838
[SPEAKER_10]: Because she's taking a lot more classes than I am.

28:53.018 --> 28:54.919
[SPEAKER_09]: How many classes are you taking?

28:55.220 --> 28:55.440
[SPEAKER_09]: Three.

28:56.340 --> 28:56.861
[SPEAKER_10]: How many units?

28:57.301 --> 28:59.382
[SPEAKER_10]: Three, because there are only one unit classes each.

28:59.522 --> 29:00.323
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

29:00.836 --> 29:02.477
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm taking four three-unit classes.

29:02.957 --> 29:04.218
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, no one's a two.

29:04.478 --> 29:06.279
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah, it's not my full-time.

29:06.439 --> 29:08.239
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm working full-time.

29:08.840 --> 29:10.701
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I got that too, so.

29:11.581 --> 29:11.801
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm?

29:12.702 --> 29:13.462
[SPEAKER_10]: I got that too.

29:14.622 --> 29:18.164
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, well, I've got work too and all that stuff, so.

29:19.565 --> 29:22.226
[SPEAKER_10]: Other than that, I didn't really do much this week.

29:22.906 --> 29:25.067
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I'm more boring than Rob is.

29:27.248 --> 29:28.449
[SPEAKER_28]: As if that's possible.

29:29.857 --> 29:36.903
[SPEAKER_28]: I forgot to say, one other thing I did is that I went to the bookstore, Borders Books, and I got a book about starting your own business.

29:36.923 --> 29:37.463
[SPEAKER_28]: You can read?

29:38.224 --> 29:39.765
[SPEAKER_28]: Amazingly enough, I can.

29:41.587 --> 29:45.350
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that if you were a corporate trainer, you couldn't read and had bad grammar.

29:45.370 --> 29:46.911
[SPEAKER_28]: Very funny, very funny.

29:49.269 --> 29:55.251
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, well, I have horrible handwriting, so whenever I write on the board, for those who don't know, my day job is I'm a corporate trainer.

29:55.771 --> 29:57.472
[SPEAKER_28]: And when I write on the board, it's very yucky.

29:57.512 --> 29:58.753
[SPEAKER_28]: That's why I like to use PowerPoint.

29:59.773 --> 30:05.735
[SPEAKER_09]: It was very much a tease because I have known some where I work who have the worst grammar ever.

30:06.155 --> 30:08.056
[SPEAKER_28]: I am the best corporate trainer you'll ever have.

30:08.096 --> 30:08.856
[SPEAKER_09]: You are the best.

30:08.876 --> 30:11.057
[SPEAKER_28]: You should come work where I work.

30:11.737 --> 30:15.399
[SPEAKER_09]: If you give me a job making what I'm going to be making in my new position, sure.

30:17.225 --> 30:19.027
[SPEAKER_28]: Everybody should come work where I work.

30:19.207 --> 30:21.689
[SPEAKER_28]: Except I'm not going to tell you where I work because I don't need any more stalkers.

30:23.971 --> 30:24.312
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyway.

30:25.192 --> 30:27.014
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh yeah, so I got the book on starting your own business.

30:27.074 --> 30:30.257
[SPEAKER_28]: So that, you know, because we're thinking about it with Orange Launch Radio.

30:30.277 --> 30:30.938
[SPEAKER_28]: We're thinking about it.

30:31.939 --> 30:32.519
[SPEAKER_28]: We're thinking about it.

30:33.820 --> 30:35.222
[SPEAKER_28]: Actually making this legit.

30:35.282 --> 30:37.083
[SPEAKER_28]: We've been doing it for, what, two and a half years now?

30:37.124 --> 30:38.465
[SPEAKER_28]: I think it's about time to make this legit.

30:39.526 --> 30:41.688
[SPEAKER_28]: We've always been in the business to sex you up.

30:47.382 --> 30:49.171
[SPEAKER_28]: on that note I think we're going to go to a break

30:50.934 --> 31:20.318
[SPEAKER_28]: and when we come back from this break I know we got a list list we want to do tonight I know we've got something that new project we want to plug for those that haven't figured it out we got a cage match we want to do we got big DDR news very full plate for us when we come back in this break I thought we could do some poppy DDR music like some DDR poppy music starting it off with one of the most poppy songs of all Dark Knight wanted to dedicate this to his friend who's having a rough week so I'm gonna do that for him because we here at Orange Lounge Radio we care

31:21.417 --> 31:21.718
[SPEAKER_28]: We care.

31:22.620 --> 31:24.564
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll be back after this with more Orange Launch Radio.

32:55.925 --> 32:57.086
[SPEAKER_28]: I made a My Bad there.

32:57.166 --> 33:01.127
[SPEAKER_28]: That was actually for DJ Ranma S's friend, not Dark Knight's friend.

33:01.167 --> 33:03.167
[SPEAKER_28]: Although maybe Dark Knight wanted to hear it too, I have no idea.

33:03.267 --> 33:07.709
[SPEAKER_28]: But as you can tell, I usually get too many private messages during the show, so I screwed up.

33:07.809 --> 33:08.189
[SPEAKER_28]: My Bad!

33:10.930 --> 33:15.851
My Bad

34:01.729 --> 34:02.653
Thank you for watching

34:38.488 --> 34:43.170
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

35:13.012 --> 35:14.294
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

35:46.298 --> 35:47.820
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

37:11.008 --> 37:15.312
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

37:41.272 --> 37:57.166
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.

38:03.251 --> 38:06.534
[SPEAKER_28]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 126.

38:09.008 --> 38:11.049
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I know, I can't believe we've been doing it that long either.

38:11.910 --> 38:20.775
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyway, we have been doing this quite a while, but there's always new stuff cooking up over at Orange Lounge Radio, and we have a brand new thing.

38:21.195 --> 38:27.938
[SPEAKER_28]: It just launched earlier this week, but we know a lot of you guys don't really pay attention to anything we do outside of this Sunday show, so we want to let you guys know.

38:28.479 --> 38:37.684
[SPEAKER_28]: There's actually a brand new show, and one of the most common requests we get here on Orange Lounge Radio is, can we download your show?

38:38.363 --> 38:40.344
[SPEAKER_28]: and to that we say, no, you can't.

38:40.644 --> 38:42.665
[SPEAKER_28]: The files are too big.

38:42.705 --> 38:43.865
[SPEAKER_09]: How does it feel to want?

38:44.786 --> 38:46.506
[SPEAKER_28]: Basically, A, the files are too big.

38:46.606 --> 38:49.668
[SPEAKER_28]: B, we want people to listen live and it hoards up our ratings.

38:49.728 --> 38:52.329
[SPEAKER_28]: And C, you can always catch the rewinds on DDR-free radio Fridays at 6.

38:53.029 --> 38:53.349
[SPEAKER_28]: Whatever.

38:53.449 --> 38:56.411
[SPEAKER_28]: So that is just not happening right now anyway.

38:56.451 --> 38:59.312
[SPEAKER_28]: I can't say it's never going to happen, but just right at this time it's not happening.

38:59.412 --> 39:04.214
[SPEAKER_28]: But we decided, we thought, well, let's give them something they can download.

39:04.234 --> 39:07.175
[SPEAKER_28]: And there's this new technology out there called podcasting.

39:07.759 --> 39:07.959
[SPEAKER_28]: P.O.D.D.E.R.

39:28.464 --> 39:30.405
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you have to have an iPod to hear this show?

39:30.845 --> 39:31.125
[SPEAKER_28]: No.

39:31.565 --> 39:36.287
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you have to have a live 365 account or do you have to listen to the station live to hear this show?

39:36.507 --> 39:36.727
[SPEAKER_28]: No.

39:36.867 --> 39:39.148
[SPEAKER_28]: It's something you download onto your computer.

39:39.168 --> 39:40.669
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you have to have broadband to hear this show?

39:40.809 --> 39:40.969
[SPEAKER_28]: No.

39:41.029 --> 39:42.370
[SPEAKER_28]: It's just going to be a little slower for you.

39:42.890 --> 39:45.011
[SPEAKER_28]: So check out on our website.

39:45.091 --> 39:46.952
[SPEAKER_28]: There's a new feature over on the left side.

39:47.032 --> 39:49.132
[SPEAKER_28]: It's called Orange Lounge Radio To Go.

39:49.653 --> 39:54.154
[SPEAKER_28]: And it's basically a brand new, I don't know, 15 to 25 minute show.

39:54.495 --> 39:55.155
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a mini show.

39:55.856 --> 39:58.861
[SPEAKER_28]: But it's something that's intended for you to download every week.

39:58.941 --> 40:08.939
[SPEAKER_28]: And for those of you guys that do have some type of portable media player such as an iPod, the whole reason it's called podcasting is because iPod is the most popular form of this.

40:09.737 --> 40:17.980
[SPEAKER_28]: But if you have any portable media player, really, what this is designed to do is that you can subscribe to the Orange Launch Radio podcast and then just keep checking it.

40:18.240 --> 40:22.381
[SPEAKER_28]: Have your iPod or program check every week or so, or check every day.

40:22.861 --> 40:26.402
[SPEAKER_28]: And every Monday or so, you're going to see a new show from us.

40:26.683 --> 40:32.444
[SPEAKER_28]: And if you have a media player, it'll hook right up to your media player so that you'll have a new show to listen to for that week.

40:32.644 --> 40:33.365
[SPEAKER_28]: So it's pretty cool.

40:33.705 --> 40:34.705
[SPEAKER_28]: You've got to check it out.

40:35.105 --> 40:37.226
[SPEAKER_28]: There's already an episode up there for grabs.

40:37.786 --> 40:41.848
[SPEAKER_28]: If you want to subscribe, I know a few of you guys have been having problems getting the most recent episode.

40:42.168 --> 40:45.210
[SPEAKER_28]: We're hoping that when we put up a new episode, it's going to fix all that.

40:45.610 --> 40:46.671
[SPEAKER_28]: So just stay tuned.

40:47.451 --> 40:49.712
[SPEAKER_28]: Go ahead, subscribe to it, and keep checking.

40:49.752 --> 40:54.334
[SPEAKER_28]: There should be a new episode up tomorrow, if not late, late tonight, possibly.

40:55.135 --> 40:56.576
[SPEAKER_28]: But there is one already there.

40:56.636 --> 40:58.937
[SPEAKER_28]: We taped a show last week, and it got put up there.

40:59.893 --> 41:01.614
[SPEAKER_28]: and a lot of folks have already been downloading it.

41:01.674 --> 41:10.781
[SPEAKER_28]: In fact, I think we might have some new folks listening to this show who actually heard the podcast first because the podcast is such a huge new technology that's out there.

41:10.821 --> 41:13.443
[SPEAKER_28]: A lot of people are just downloading new shows as they can find it.

41:14.023 --> 41:17.165
[SPEAKER_28]: And if you came all this way to listen to our live show, hey, thanks a bunch.

41:17.826 --> 41:20.067
[SPEAKER_28]: Stop on in the chat room and let us know you enjoyed it.

41:20.888 --> 41:23.930
[SPEAKER_28]: www.OrangeLaunchRadio.com Click on chat.

41:25.043 --> 41:28.724
[SPEAKER_28]: And yes, it is a show we plan to do every week, if not more.

41:29.104 --> 41:37.826
[SPEAKER_28]: We might actually, I mean, when we go on the road, such as, oh, I don't know, E3, we might be able to use this technology to do updates every day.

41:37.906 --> 41:39.746
[SPEAKER_28]: Little shows, little interviews from E3.

41:39.826 --> 41:41.407
[SPEAKER_28]: So, stay tuned.

41:41.607 --> 41:41.987
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very cool.

41:42.007 --> 41:43.207
[SPEAKER_09]: I also have the Infernal Machine.

41:44.047 --> 41:44.327
[SPEAKER_28]: Mm-hmm.

41:45.848 --> 41:46.988
[SPEAKER_28]: So, yeah, that...

41:49.417 --> 41:50.557
[SPEAKER_28]: So, wow.

41:51.298 --> 41:52.079
[SPEAKER_28]: Lots of stuff there.

41:52.119 --> 41:53.620
[SPEAKER_28]: The podcast is an exciting feature.

41:53.680 --> 41:56.982
[SPEAKER_28]: Remember, all you've got to do is subscribe and you're set.

41:58.510 --> 42:11.100
[SPEAKER_28]: Now, of course, all the chat room is saying the next step is Orange Lounge Radio Television and I want my OLR TV, which is kind of funny because when you think about it, I don't know if you knew this, but do you know who one of the driving forces behind podcasting was?

42:11.200 --> 42:13.942
[SPEAKER_28]: One of the people that kind of came up with the idea with some friends?

42:14.523 --> 42:18.085
[SPEAKER_28]: Adam Curry, the MTV VJ from years ago.

42:18.366 --> 42:19.146
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, he was cool.

42:19.366 --> 42:20.187
[SPEAKER_28]: He was awesome.

42:20.307 --> 42:24.730
[SPEAKER_28]: And now he's got this thing, which just makes him even more cool.

42:24.831 --> 42:26.592
[SPEAKER_28]: So, you know, it's awesome.

42:27.116 --> 42:31.798
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it would be, like, ultimately cool if, like, it were also sponsored by Martha Quinn.

42:32.378 --> 42:33.118
[SPEAKER_09]: Then I would be happy.

42:33.158 --> 42:35.059
[SPEAKER_09]: Because she has nice hair.

42:35.519 --> 42:40.141
[SPEAKER_28]: Instead of being hosted by us, we'll just have Julie Brown and... You know what we need?

42:40.341 --> 42:40.562
[SPEAKER_28]: What?

42:40.802 --> 42:45.644
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to do something... When we have our TV show, we need, like, the remote control segment.

42:46.524 --> 42:47.544
[SPEAKER_09]: Complete with those chairs.

42:47.985 --> 42:49.185
[SPEAKER_28]: Seriously, remote control.

42:49.425 --> 42:52.927
[SPEAKER_28]: That could be, like, our game show, the match game segment or something.

42:53.327 --> 42:54.367
[SPEAKER_28]: If you get the answer wrong.

42:54.927 --> 42:56.108
[SPEAKER_28]: Nah, nah, nah, nah.

42:58.122 --> 42:59.423
[SPEAKER_28]: I remember when MTV was cool.

42:59.744 --> 43:01.145
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, now they suck on ice.

43:01.185 --> 43:04.848
[SPEAKER_28]: But the weird thing is, how old were we when MTV was cool?

43:04.928 --> 43:07.070
[SPEAKER_28]: Maybe 12, around that age?

43:07.511 --> 43:12.115
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the tale of when MTV was cool was when I was a senior in high school, so I was 18.

43:12.835 --> 43:17.399
[SPEAKER_28]: Was probably when these guys like Adam Curry and Martha Quinn and them were still on the air.

43:17.860 --> 43:19.061
[SPEAKER_28]: We're showing our age a little bit.

43:19.517 --> 43:20.117
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

43:40.502 --> 43:51.892
[SPEAKER_09]: Back when Mike Myers and Dana Carvey and all them were on... Now, some would argue with you that this old 75 cast with Bill Murray... Well, they were great too, but I mean as far as the more modern era of Saturday Night Live.

43:52.392 --> 43:55.295
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I would probably turn on 120 Minutes and Headbangers Ball.

43:56.716 --> 43:57.517
[SPEAKER_28]: My God, look at this!

43:58.012 --> 44:01.473
[SPEAKER_28]: Our chat room right now, you've got to see this over in OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on chat.

44:01.673 --> 44:07.094
[SPEAKER_28]: They're practically creating this whole treatment for an Orange Lounge Radio TV show that could be on MTV.

44:07.134 --> 44:13.336
[SPEAKER_28]: They're saying, oh, the cage match could have videos on it, people could vote, and it's crazy.

44:13.476 --> 44:14.036
[SPEAKER_28]: That's awesome.

44:14.096 --> 44:14.756
[SPEAKER_28]: You guys rock.

44:16.257 --> 44:16.577
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know.

44:16.657 --> 44:17.637
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know what to tell you guys.

44:17.977 --> 44:24.839
[SPEAKER_28]: I'd love to see it happen someday, but at the same time, got to pay the rent, so I can't quit my J-Dub yet until somebody...

44:26.235 --> 44:27.516
[SPEAKER_28]: Here, Rob, here's some money.

44:27.936 --> 44:28.616
[SPEAKER_28]: Come do a show.

44:28.916 --> 44:30.317
[SPEAKER_28]: Then I'd be all, fuck yeah, I quit.

44:31.037 --> 44:31.377
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll see.

44:31.657 --> 44:35.458
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm sure you're the same, right?

44:36.098 --> 44:38.219
[SPEAKER_28]: Get paid to do Wayne's World?

44:38.679 --> 44:40.860
[SPEAKER_28]: Shut up.

44:42.841 --> 44:45.782
[SPEAKER_28]: That's like my dream right there is Wayne's World, the movie.

44:45.802 --> 44:47.422
[SPEAKER_28]: Except don't they get kind of screwed in the end?

44:48.062 --> 44:48.322
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh well.

44:49.343 --> 44:49.763
[SPEAKER_28]: Who cares?

44:51.246 --> 45:02.963
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll see, maybe someday But I think the podcast is a really exciting technology because it allows people like Adam Curry to hear us Anyway, we'll see what happens

45:04.241 --> 45:04.581
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

45:05.242 --> 45:07.063
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyway, so there's the podcast.

45:07.163 --> 45:11.007
[SPEAKER_28]: Again, I urge you guys to check this out on the website over at orangelaunchradio.com.

45:11.027 --> 45:11.867
[SPEAKER_28]: Just look in the upper left.

45:11.907 --> 45:13.308
[SPEAKER_28]: It says Orange Launch Radio to go.

45:13.829 --> 45:15.390
[SPEAKER_28]: It's really easy to set up.

45:15.490 --> 45:22.856
[SPEAKER_28]: Honestly, if you were able to listen to this show, if you were able to sign up for Live 365 and get this show to play, you can do this podcast thing.

45:22.916 --> 45:23.797
[SPEAKER_28]: It's super easy.

45:24.097 --> 45:25.899
[SPEAKER_28]: And again, you don't have to have a portable player.

45:26.199 --> 45:30.963
[SPEAKER_28]: You can just have it download the MP3 and you listen to it in Winamp or iTunes or whatever later.

45:31.423 --> 45:42.045
[SPEAKER_28]: And just an FYI, for those of you guys that do listen to this, that show is actually encoded in MP3 Pro, which doesn't do you any good if you have an iPod, because iPods don't decode it.

45:42.085 --> 45:45.905
[SPEAKER_28]: But if you're using Winamp, you can actually listen to that show in MP3 Pro, and it sounds great.

45:46.966 --> 45:47.706
[SPEAKER_28]: So, just a thought.

45:48.446 --> 45:48.706
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

45:49.566 --> 45:49.846
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyway.

45:51.086 --> 45:52.387
[SPEAKER_28]: On to some actual gaming news.

45:52.427 --> 45:54.027
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's talk gaming news that's going on right now.

45:54.627 --> 45:55.787
[SPEAKER_28]: Huge... No, this is huge.

45:55.827 --> 45:56.567
[SPEAKER_28]: This is really huge.

45:59.288 --> 45:59.588
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

46:00.328 --> 46:00.408
[SPEAKER_28]: In...

46:01.541 --> 46:03.783
[SPEAKER_28]: The DDR scene this week, there was huge news.

46:04.443 --> 46:10.007
[SPEAKER_28]: What has been one thing that people in the DDR scene have been begging for for the longest time?

46:10.888 --> 46:11.708
[SPEAKER_28]: Other than to get laid.

46:13.189 --> 46:14.910
[SPEAKER_24]: A 62 foot long cigar?

46:16.411 --> 46:17.993
[SPEAKER_24]: No, not a 62 foot long cigar.

46:18.013 --> 46:18.353
[SPEAKER_24]: What else?

46:22.335 --> 46:23.997
[SPEAKER_09]: They want more Mambo and Go-Go.

46:25.478 --> 46:30.281
[SPEAKER_24]: They want a DDR game featuring characters from other games that have nothing to do with DDR whatsoever.

46:31.257 --> 46:32.259
[SPEAKER_24]: That's absolutely right.

46:32.319 --> 46:34.943
[SPEAKER_28]: No, actually, I'll tell you, since you obviously don't know.

46:35.364 --> 46:37.909
[SPEAKER_28]: They want a DDR game on the GameCube.

46:38.850 --> 46:40.233
[SPEAKER_28]: Because GameCube doesn't have a DDR game.

46:40.253 --> 46:41.214
[SPEAKER_09]: There was one on the Nintendo 64.

46:41.735 --> 46:42.697
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, not the GameCube.

46:44.446 --> 46:49.010
[SPEAKER_28]: So, GameCube announced this week is getting its own DDR game.

46:49.811 --> 46:54.896
[SPEAKER_24]: Does this fulfill my fantasy for having to buy yet another peripheral for another game system to play DDR?

46:55.076 --> 46:57.458
[SPEAKER_09]: You can never have too many specialty controllers, dammit.

46:57.558 --> 46:58.339
[SPEAKER_28]: It absolutely does.

46:58.599 --> 47:01.742
[SPEAKER_28]: And if you think about it, Nintendo is really the granddaddy of DDR.

47:01.782 --> 47:03.464
[SPEAKER_28]: The granddaddy, granddaddy, granddaddy.

47:03.484 --> 47:06.206
[SPEAKER_28]: Like, the great, great granddaddy of DDR is Dance Aerobics.

47:07.307 --> 47:09.029
[SPEAKER_28]: If you think about it, with the power pad.

47:09.649 --> 47:10.150
[SPEAKER_28]: So, um...

47:11.187 --> 47:15.670
[SPEAKER_28]: It makes sense that it's going back to its roots and DDR is going to be showing up on the GameCube.

47:16.210 --> 47:18.231
[SPEAKER_28]: Details are very sketchy at this time.

47:18.331 --> 47:19.112
[SPEAKER_28]: This is what we know.

47:19.552 --> 47:22.434
[SPEAKER_28]: It's DDR featuring Mario.

47:24.455 --> 47:28.678
[SPEAKER_09]: We can urge to refer to old cartoon Rising.

47:29.318 --> 47:30.439
[SPEAKER_28]: I know, I know, seriously.

47:31.219 --> 47:33.421
[SPEAKER_28]: Absolutely the first thing I thought of when I heard this.

47:33.521 --> 47:38.404
[SPEAKER_28]: I read this story and it was very... Earlier this week the rain was keeping me up at like 4 in the morning.

47:38.965 --> 47:56.816
[SPEAKER_28]: and I ended up getting online and I read about this and just instantly I couldn't help but when I read that DDR and Mario were teaming up to do this I couldn't help but think about this Hey Paisanos, it's the Super Mario Brothers Super Show

47:57.560 --> 47:59.462
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you late 80s early 90s

48:50.429 --> 48:53.892
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, you gotta love that echo at the end.

48:54.152 --> 48:56.274
[SPEAKER_23]: Hooked on the brothers, brothers, brothers.

48:57.295 --> 49:00.598
[SPEAKER_28]: I am petitioning Nintendo myself to have that song included.

49:01.499 --> 49:02.420
[SPEAKER_28]: It needs to be there.

49:02.560 --> 49:04.622
[SPEAKER_28]: It absolutely needs to be there in DDR Mario.

49:05.223 --> 49:07.145
[SPEAKER_28]: Or the one with Lou Albano singing it at the end.

49:07.385 --> 49:09.587
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's all do some Mario.

49:09.647 --> 49:10.188
[SPEAKER_28]: Remember that one?

49:10.928 --> 49:12.670
[SPEAKER_28]: I wish we had an MP3 of that we could play too, but...

49:13.832 --> 49:26.140
[SPEAKER_28]: So, here it is, Nintendo is going to be doing this DDR game, but Konami, it's some kind of partnership, and we don't really know in what capacity, if Nintendo is making the game with Konami's blessing, or what's going on.

49:26.380 --> 49:35.807
[SPEAKER_28]: I have a feeling it's going to be very similar to Donkey Konga, because when you look at Donkey Konga, it's basically Taiko Drum Master, but with Donkey Konga.

49:36.787 --> 49:37.568
[SPEAKER_28]: Stupid clapping!

49:38.607 --> 49:40.148
[SPEAKER_28]: But it had Namco's blessing.

49:40.349 --> 49:42.070
[SPEAKER_28]: Namco actually helped him out with the game.

49:42.110 --> 49:43.872
[SPEAKER_28]: So I think it's going to be very similar to that.

49:43.892 --> 49:44.792
[SPEAKER_28]: That's just speculation.

49:44.812 --> 49:45.133
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll see.

49:45.273 --> 49:45.513
[SPEAKER_28]: Loki?

49:46.654 --> 49:47.615
[SPEAKER_24]: There's one thing for sure.

49:47.655 --> 49:48.936
[SPEAKER_24]: It's going to have awesome minigames.

49:48.956 --> 49:52.579
[SPEAKER_24]: Because if there's one thing that Nintendo's good at, it's making minigames for games.

49:53.760 --> 50:02.547
[SPEAKER_24]: So that would be a lot better than that crappy, what, feed the oddly shaped animal heads or whatever, you know?

50:03.168 --> 50:06.871
[SPEAKER_24]: Or the frustrating, hit the ball around the maze thing.

50:07.571 --> 50:09.174
[SPEAKER_24]: That's a lot better than that.

50:13.564 --> 50:14.185
[SPEAKER_24]: I just can't.

50:14.465 --> 50:15.648
[SPEAKER_28]: No, I can't buy this game.

50:17.952 --> 50:19.593
[SPEAKER_28]: It's alright, because I'm definitely going to buy it.

50:19.633 --> 50:20.354
[SPEAKER_28]: I have to buy this game.

50:20.814 --> 50:26.359
[SPEAKER_28]: If you actually look at our website, orangelawnradio.com, we actually posted a story about this earlier this week.

50:26.419 --> 50:27.660
[SPEAKER_28]: It's like the second story down.

50:27.720 --> 50:33.885
[SPEAKER_28]: It says, DDR teaming up with Mario, and if you actually click on the read more, you can see some screenshots from the game.

50:34.405 --> 50:40.550
[SPEAKER_28]: And the first two screenshots look like your standard DDR setup, although the two-player mode is interesting.

50:40.610 --> 50:41.111
[SPEAKER_28]: It looks like

50:42.074 --> 50:43.634
[SPEAKER_28]: Some of the dancing characters you can have.

50:43.654 --> 50:48.095
[SPEAKER_28]: You have a little Mario, and then it looks like a little... Either that's a Hammer Brother, or it's a Koopa Troopa.

50:48.115 --> 50:50.176
[SPEAKER_28]: I can't really tell, because it's from the Skyview.

50:50.196 --> 50:52.276
[SPEAKER_28]: I think it's a Hammer Brother, because I see a hammer in the picture.

50:52.837 --> 50:56.577
[SPEAKER_28]: So it looks like those are some of the, maybe, dancing characters that might be available.

50:56.617 --> 50:56.978
[SPEAKER_28]: Who knows?

50:57.738 --> 51:04.119
[SPEAKER_28]: But then the third picture in there, it shows Mario running from snowballs, and there are no arrows on the screen.

51:04.539 --> 51:06.760
[SPEAKER_28]: So it makes you think that it's some kind of minigame.

51:06.840 --> 51:11.561
[SPEAKER_28]: So I think it's definite that there's got to be a minigame that's going to turn up in here somewhere.

51:12.702 --> 51:17.265
[SPEAKER_24]: All it really is, is it comes down to... Look, Konami made a DDR pad.

51:17.466 --> 51:20.868
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, now we don't have to make another power pad, so let's make another power pad game.

51:21.929 --> 51:22.469
[SPEAKER_24]: That's what it is.

51:24.991 --> 51:28.194
[SPEAKER_28]: I just... Nintendo, I think, is finally realizing they missed the boat on DDR.

51:28.214 --> 51:29.314
[SPEAKER_28]: They should have had this a long time ago.

51:29.695 --> 51:30.916
[SPEAKER_28]: And that Mad Catz game?

51:30.956 --> 51:31.536
[SPEAKER_28]: What the hell was that?

51:31.676 --> 51:32.597
[SPEAKER_28]: MC Groove thing?

51:33.798 --> 51:34.038
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

51:34.904 --> 51:35.964
[SPEAKER_28]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

52:00.268 --> 52:08.434
[SPEAKER_28]: or you can play Parents Don't Understand for like five minutes because they don't cut their songs down and then the arrows don't make any sense at all and they come from the middle of the screen.

52:08.534 --> 52:09.194
[SPEAKER_28]: What the hell?

52:09.915 --> 52:10.775
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you can play In the Groove.

52:12.457 --> 52:16.379
[SPEAKER_28]: I would play In the Groove for three days straight before I would ever touch that other game.

52:17.500 --> 52:17.900
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, Angel?

52:18.721 --> 52:19.481
[SPEAKER_28]: You look like you have a comment.

52:19.501 --> 52:23.925
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel a little scared because you were just talking about the whole Mario thing and what shirt am I wearing?

52:24.145 --> 52:24.485
[SPEAKER_10]: Oops!

52:25.566 --> 52:26.046
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

52:26.066 --> 52:26.626
[SPEAKER_28]: You're in the mood.

52:26.646 --> 52:27.427
[SPEAKER_28]: You're being festive.

52:28.528 --> 52:28.808
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

52:29.338 --> 52:31.060
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm wearing my DDR Freak shirt.

52:31.160 --> 52:32.401
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

52:32.521 --> 52:32.902
[SPEAKER_28]: Wow.

52:33.482 --> 52:36.085
[SPEAKER_28]: Now, if you two merged your shirts, you'd have this new game.

52:37.286 --> 52:39.889
[SPEAKER_10]: Very true, in a weird sort of way, yeah.

52:39.909 --> 52:40.290
[SPEAKER_10]: Scary.

52:40.430 --> 52:44.234
[SPEAKER_28]: The working title of this game is Dance Dance Revolution with Mario.

52:46.297 --> 52:47.939
[SPEAKER_28]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

53:06.956 --> 53:30.233
[SPEAKER_28]: Many games, it looks like it's going to come out summer of 2005 is when this game is scheduled to come out We're going to get the first peek at the game at the 2005 World Hobby Fair And that happens in Tokyo on January 16th So by this time next week, we ought to know some more details on this game So we'll definitely pass it along to you as soon as we know

53:33.371 --> 53:33.671
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

53:34.993 --> 53:37.316
[SPEAKER_28]: Any wishes you guys hope to see with this game?

53:37.396 --> 53:39.859
[SPEAKER_28]: The Dance Dance Revolution with Mario game?

53:40.660 --> 53:41.601
[SPEAKER_28]: Anything on your wish list?

53:43.616 --> 53:47.537
[SPEAKER_09]: I want the swimming music to be in there.

53:50.698 --> 53:52.899
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't make me break out my cell phone.

53:52.999 --> 53:55.879
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how they would... No, you know what has to be in there?

53:55.899 --> 53:56.640
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of cell phones.

53:57.180 --> 53:57.500
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-oh.

53:57.660 --> 53:57.980
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

53:58.260 --> 53:58.980
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me get out my cell phone.

53:59.420 --> 54:00.141
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

54:00.161 --> 54:03.621
[SPEAKER_28]: Meantime, while she's digging for that, Angel, wish list for this dance set?

54:03.661 --> 54:11.484
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I was going to say a remix of the water music myself, but if we can't have that, then I guess the... What is it?

54:11.544 --> 54:12.264
[SPEAKER_10]: Level 2 music?

54:12.344 --> 54:12.524
[SPEAKER_10]: The...

54:13.044 --> 54:15.105
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, the blue level.

54:15.826 --> 54:16.526
[SPEAKER_10]: After the first one.

54:16.546 --> 54:17.227
[SPEAKER_28]: The blue level.

54:17.987 --> 54:18.688
[SPEAKER_10]: No, the... Here we go.

54:22.910 --> 54:23.210
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes!

54:24.011 --> 54:24.871
[SPEAKER_10]: Super Mario World!

54:25.031 --> 54:25.532
Yay!

54:27.353 --> 54:28.774
[SPEAKER_28]: Can you really dance to that?

54:29.254 --> 54:29.574
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

54:30.175 --> 54:31.435
[SPEAKER_10]: In a really messed up sort of way?

54:31.475 --> 54:31.776
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

54:31.796 --> 54:33.196
[SPEAKER_10]: It'd be kind of hard.

54:36.699 --> 54:40.501
[SPEAKER_28]: I want the Campfire medley from Donkey Konga.

54:40.521 --> 54:41.161
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

54:43.331 --> 54:44.171
[SPEAKER_09]: I love my phone.

54:44.911 --> 54:46.592
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a medley of all these campfire songs.

54:46.672 --> 54:47.872
[SPEAKER_28]: That's pretty good quality.

54:49.213 --> 54:51.933
[SPEAKER_28]: Loki, your wish list for Dance Dance Revolution with Mario?

54:53.814 --> 54:58.175
[SPEAKER_24]: That that be the only game they release on the GameCube for DDR.

54:59.895 --> 55:00.876
[SPEAKER_24]: Why you gotta hate?

55:00.976 --> 55:02.476
[SPEAKER_24]: Why you being such a hater with this?

55:02.536 --> 55:03.156
[SPEAKER_24]: I've gotta know.

55:04.557 --> 55:06.197
[SPEAKER_28]: It's gonna suck just like Donkey Konga.

55:07.563 --> 55:09.525
[SPEAKER_28]: I didn't think Donkey Konga sucked.

55:09.545 --> 55:10.546
[SPEAKER_28]: There could have been more to it.

55:10.566 --> 55:11.508
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, we get the idea, Jimmy.

55:11.708 --> 55:12.308
[SPEAKER_28]: Seriously, we get it.

55:12.889 --> 55:16.933
[SPEAKER_09]: I was wondering when you'd say something.

55:20.718 --> 55:24.502
[SPEAKER_28]: Donkey Konga, there could have been more to it, but it wasn't a bad game.

55:24.522 --> 55:26.624
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, it was.

55:27.754 --> 55:28.174
[SPEAKER_28]: Whatever.

55:28.695 --> 55:29.035
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

55:30.936 --> 55:38.700
[SPEAKER_28]: My wish list, I want to see Princess Peach as a dancing character, and whenever the stage is over, she'll go, Peach is the winner!

55:39.461 --> 55:40.121
[SPEAKER_28]: Just like at Mario Party.

55:40.141 --> 55:41.282
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully they don't hooch her all up.

55:42.202 --> 55:49.947
[SPEAKER_28]: Dude, they should have Princess Peach in the Emmy costume that was shown at the Ultimix 2 demo at E3 when Emmy was all hoochified.

55:50.407 --> 55:51.808
[SPEAKER_28]: They need that, but Princess Peach.

55:51.828 --> 55:52.508
[SPEAKER_28]: It would be awesome.

55:55.723 --> 55:57.484
[SPEAKER_28]: I can't wait to find out more information about this game.

55:57.904 --> 56:05.248
[SPEAKER_28]: I actually think this game has the potential to be very cool, because Nintendo, they've just got such classic songs, and it's going to be so cute.

56:05.528 --> 56:10.531
[SPEAKER_28]: It's probably going to be geared for kids, and it'll probably end up being like OHA DDR, but I don't care.

56:10.851 --> 56:13.493
[SPEAKER_28]: Or Disney's Rave, Disney's Mix, whatever you call it.

56:16.054 --> 56:19.336
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, we need more kiddie DDR.

56:19.716 --> 56:22.057
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to get them hooked young, like crack.

56:23.447 --> 56:24.107
[SPEAKER_09]: Jungle Book or something?

56:53.017 --> 56:53.598
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, God.

56:53.658 --> 56:56.421
[SPEAKER_28]: The game that got me a dance pad for the first time.

56:56.441 --> 56:57.181
[SPEAKER_09]: You had that tiny thing.

56:57.242 --> 56:57.582
[SPEAKER_28]: I did.

56:57.722 --> 56:58.483
[SPEAKER_28]: It was... Okay.

56:59.013 --> 57:01.034
[SPEAKER_09]: And I had to bring you Third Mix to fix that.

57:01.114 --> 57:05.796
[SPEAKER_28]: This was, it was the very first US release of a dancing game.

57:05.836 --> 57:08.257
[SPEAKER_28]: This was out before Dance Dance Revolution USA.

57:08.677 --> 57:10.738
[SPEAKER_28]: And it was the Jungle Book dance game.

57:10.778 --> 57:14.380
[SPEAKER_28]: It was put out by, I don't remember what the game, it was Jungle Groove.

57:14.540 --> 57:15.720
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I think it was called Jungle Groove.

57:16.281 --> 57:20.762
[SPEAKER_28]: And it actually came with a little dance mat, but the dance mat was made for like a five year old.

57:21.163 --> 57:23.504
[SPEAKER_28]: But I bought it because I wanted a dance mat.

57:24.904 --> 57:27.645
[SPEAKER_28]: And it was this... I remember that Lou Bega was in it.

57:28.125 --> 57:33.007
[SPEAKER_28]: Because, like, he did a cover of that song that went, I wanna walk like you, talk like you, too.

57:33.147 --> 57:34.267
[SPEAKER_28]: Remember that song from the Jungle Book?

57:34.667 --> 57:37.368
[SPEAKER_28]: And that was, like, the big song you could unlock if you played it enough.

57:38.188 --> 57:38.649
[SPEAKER_28]: What, Loki?

57:38.669 --> 57:41.189
[SPEAKER_28]: You're giving EDS, Evil's Death, stare over here.

57:42.710 --> 57:49.152
[SPEAKER_24]: Like I said before, this is why they do not need to make any more games for the GameCube that feature DDR.

57:49.352 --> 57:51.793
[SPEAKER_24]: Or, I know this was, like, for the Nintendo 64.

57:51.833 --> 57:52.613
[SPEAKER_24]: It still sucked.

57:53.106 --> 57:54.387
[SPEAKER_24]: Still, a Nintendo game sucked.

57:54.948 --> 57:56.490
[SPEAKER_28]: This game actually was PlayStation.

57:56.530 --> 57:57.911
[SPEAKER_28]: This was a PlayStation game that I bought.

57:58.171 --> 57:58.672
[SPEAKER_24]: Still sucked.

57:59.952 --> 58:04.196
[SPEAKER_28]: And I remember that this was right when I was starting to get into DDR.

58:04.496 --> 58:08.419
[SPEAKER_28]: And I finally remember that Jamie and some other folks all came to my apartment.

58:08.880 --> 58:13.964
[SPEAKER_28]: And Jamie actually brought a little plug, a mod plug that would plug into the back of the PlayStation.

58:14.124 --> 58:14.965
[SPEAKER_09]: The game killer.

58:15.085 --> 58:15.745
[SPEAKER_28]: The game killer.

58:16.126 --> 58:19.749
[SPEAKER_28]: And then she brought a copy of Third Mix.

58:20.469 --> 58:25.634
[SPEAKER_28]: And we played DDR Third Mix on my little Jungle Book dance mat that's made for five-year-olds.

58:26.278 --> 58:30.599
[SPEAKER_28]: and I don't remember, I think it was LankyStyle was dancing to Graduizic Cyber.

58:31.679 --> 58:34.560
[SPEAKER_28]: Funny stuff on that little five-year-old dance pad.

58:36.821 --> 58:37.221
[SPEAKER_28]: Memories.

58:38.961 --> 58:39.962
[SPEAKER_28]: Finally the damn thing broke.

58:39.982 --> 58:41.302
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a long-ass time ago.

58:41.402 --> 58:43.703
[SPEAKER_28]: The down arrow broke on that thing after like a week.

58:44.043 --> 58:44.943
[SPEAKER_09]: This was what?

58:46.029 --> 58:46.890
[SPEAKER_09]: 4 years ago.

58:46.910 --> 58:47.530
[SPEAKER_28]: 5 years ago.

59:08.423 --> 59:10.825
[SPEAKER_28]: and we found the Golf Land Machine December of 2000.

59:10.985 --> 59:12.466
[SPEAKER_28]: That's when we really started getting into it.

59:12.486 --> 59:13.127
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was early 2001 then.

59:13.167 --> 59:13.547
[SPEAKER_09]: It was early 2001.

59:13.587 --> 59:14.648
[SPEAKER_09]: But it was in the winter time.

59:15.328 --> 59:24.435
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't even know we had machines in town until like September of 2000 when I would go play the 1.5.

59:26.276 --> 59:26.657
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh yes.

59:27.037 --> 59:28.958
[SPEAKER_28]: And play Boom Boom Dollar over and over again.

59:30.299 --> 59:31.841
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you remember what the trick code was?

59:31.921 --> 59:32.861
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't even remember what it was.

59:33.502 --> 59:35.423
[SPEAKER_28]: It was like left, left, down, down, right, right or something.

59:35.463 --> 59:35.904
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't remember.

59:36.424 --> 59:37.545
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it was the running steps.

59:38.433 --> 59:39.473
[SPEAKER_28]: Was it left, down, right, down, left?

59:39.654 --> 59:40.714
[SPEAKER_09]: Left, down, right, down, left.

59:40.734 --> 59:43.635
[SPEAKER_28]: I thought there was, you had to hit one of them twice.

59:44.876 --> 59:47.037
[SPEAKER_09]: It was, that was for Maniac.

59:48.217 --> 59:53.259
[SPEAKER_28]: Back in my day, you didn't get to just push the little button and be on Maniac steps.

59:53.279 --> 59:56.320
[SPEAKER_16]: You had to do the little... We didn't have Vivid.

59:56.941 --> 59:59.242
[SPEAKER_16]: We had, they were all one color and we liked it.

59:59.442 --> 01:00:01.783
[SPEAKER_28]: And it wasn't called Heavy, it was called Maniac.

01:00:01.803 --> 01:00:02.123
[SPEAKER_16]: Maniac.

01:00:02.683 --> 01:00:04.344
[SPEAKER_28]: Because you had to be one to play on it.

01:00:05.284 --> 01:00:07.505
[SPEAKER_09]: And we had one paranoia mix.

01:00:09.787 --> 01:00:10.327
[SPEAKER_28]: Absolutely.

01:00:10.767 --> 01:00:11.348
[SPEAKER_09]: So bad.

01:00:11.428 --> 01:00:12.068
[SPEAKER_28]: Preach on.

01:00:13.809 --> 01:00:16.250
[SPEAKER_28]: Now I'm all in the mood for some nostalgic DDR music.

01:00:18.131 --> 01:00:19.111
[SPEAKER_28]: So I think we're going to take a break.

01:00:19.751 --> 01:00:24.053
[SPEAKER_28]: And when we come back from this break, more stuff, including tonight's cage match.

01:00:24.553 --> 01:00:28.035
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to do a list list tonight at some point, and who knows what else.

01:00:28.135 --> 01:00:29.716
[SPEAKER_28]: So we'll be back after this.

01:00:30.556 --> 01:00:30.816
[SPEAKER_28]: Enjoy.

01:00:49.201 --> 01:00:52.584
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:01:16.246 --> 01:01:17.086
Thank you for watching!

01:01:55.208 --> 01:01:56.017
DarkSakura.com

01:02:25.271 --> 01:02:26.173
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:34.162
[SPEAKER_11]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:04:46.492 --> 01:04:46.794
Thank you.

01:06:15.225 --> 01:06:21.088
[SPEAKER_03]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because Real Radio makes Captain Jack cry.

01:06:25.470 --> 01:06:27.171
[SPEAKER_28]: You know the thing I realized about that promo?

01:06:27.231 --> 01:06:32.273
[SPEAKER_28]: What is Real Radio anymore these days, honestly, with all the... Everyone's on the Sirius Network.

01:06:32.293 --> 01:06:33.974
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we should go on the Sirius Network.

01:06:33.994 --> 01:06:34.575
[SPEAKER_28]: Seriously.

01:06:34.595 --> 01:06:35.295
[SPEAKER_28]: Seriously.

01:06:36.744 --> 01:06:38.746
[SPEAKER_09]: Man's still trying to bring us down.

01:07:02.316 --> 01:07:03.997
[SPEAKER_28]: I know, I know.

01:07:04.098 --> 01:07:08.321
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm having fun watching the chatroom there over at www.orangelonsradio.com.

01:07:08.341 --> 01:07:09.042
[SPEAKER_28]: Click on chat.

01:07:09.702 --> 01:07:14.906
[SPEAKER_28]: They're just talking about the DDR Mario game and just expectations.

01:07:14.926 --> 01:07:16.648
[SPEAKER_28]: Some people are already saying, it's going to suck.

01:07:17.088 --> 01:07:17.789
[SPEAKER_28]: Game's going to suck.

01:07:17.869 --> 01:07:18.529
[SPEAKER_28]: It's going to be horrible.

01:07:18.669 --> 01:07:19.570
[SPEAKER_28]: Worst game ever.

01:07:21.832 --> 01:07:22.552
[SPEAKER_28]: We shall see.

01:07:22.993 --> 01:07:23.793
[SPEAKER_28]: We shall soon see.

01:07:24.894 --> 01:07:30.739
[SPEAKER_28]: Somebody was talking about, then somehow the chat in the chatroom went on to playing DDR with a light gun.

01:07:32.512 --> 01:07:32.912
[SPEAKER_28]: DarkSakura.com

01:07:52.278 --> 01:07:54.339
[SPEAKER_10]: The screw.

01:07:54.359 --> 01:07:58.282
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, there's a screw.

01:07:58.502 --> 01:07:59.343
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right, that's key.

01:07:59.463 --> 01:07:59.843
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

01:08:00.444 --> 01:08:03.646
[SPEAKER_10]: But, yeah, that's what it reminded me of when you said light gun and DDR heroes.

01:08:03.666 --> 01:08:04.727
[SPEAKER_10]: No one going, no!

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:08.849
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, boy.

01:08:09.150 --> 01:08:09.550
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

01:08:11.171 --> 01:08:14.413
[SPEAKER_28]: I hope this... You know, we don't know for sure if DDR Mario is even going to come to America.

01:08:16.015 --> 01:08:19.357
[SPEAKER_28]: It's so far, you know, all the writings in Japanese, so... But I would...

01:08:21.791 --> 01:08:24.912
[SPEAKER_28]: Loki says no plans, but I say it's gotta happen.

01:08:25.052 --> 01:08:26.993
[SPEAKER_28]: They would be idiots not to port this to the US.

01:08:27.013 --> 01:08:27.413
[SPEAKER_09]: Freeloader.

01:08:28.874 --> 01:08:29.514
[SPEAKER_28]: Not even that.

01:08:29.694 --> 01:08:30.914
[SPEAKER_09]: All you need is Freeloader.

01:08:30.994 --> 01:08:33.895
[SPEAKER_28]: I know, but I don't even... I want to play a US mix.

01:08:34.976 --> 01:08:38.757
[SPEAKER_28]: Nintendo would be absolute morons to not bring this game to the US.

01:08:39.097 --> 01:08:40.018
[SPEAKER_28]: Absolute morons.

01:08:43.739 --> 01:08:44.159
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:46.860
[SPEAKER_24]: No, actually, no, they wouldn't.

01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:48.241
[SPEAKER_24]: Keep it far away from the States.

01:08:48.401 --> 01:08:49.181
[SPEAKER_24]: Far, far away.

01:08:50.017 --> 01:08:50.538
[SPEAKER_28]: Don't hate!

01:08:50.778 --> 01:08:51.218
[SPEAKER_28]: Don't hate!

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:06.541
[SPEAKER_24]: Thanks for watching!

01:09:21.571 --> 01:09:23.573
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyways, he does some really kick-ass sim files.

01:09:23.613 --> 01:09:35.021
[SPEAKER_24]: He's done one for Ecstasy, the 14 Hours Club mix, the Gravity, DarkSakura, Burn Nation mix, and Legend of Tak on there.

01:09:35.542 --> 01:09:41.206
[SPEAKER_24]: And he's also done some other cool songs, so go check those out on Bomani Style.

01:09:41.246 --> 01:09:48.972
[SPEAKER_24]: And if I'm nice, I might go and link them in the LiveJournal community for Orange Lounge Radio, which you can find on LiveJournal.com.

01:09:51.124 --> 01:09:53.025
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm so glad you took the opportunity to whore that out.

01:09:53.085 --> 01:09:54.807
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, check out our LiveJournal community.

01:09:54.847 --> 01:09:55.767
[SPEAKER_28]: Just go to orangezontrade.com.

01:09:55.807 --> 01:09:57.548
[SPEAKER_09]: You're being immortalized in the sim file.

01:09:57.769 --> 01:09:58.109
[SPEAKER_28]: Exactly.

01:09:58.129 --> 01:09:58.669
[SPEAKER_09]: That's rad.

01:09:58.729 --> 01:09:59.169
[SPEAKER_28]: That is pretty.

01:09:59.550 --> 01:10:01.871
[SPEAKER_28]: And one of them is your song.

01:10:01.911 --> 01:10:02.652
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know.

01:10:02.712 --> 01:10:04.693
[SPEAKER_28]: And your name's on the background and everything.

01:10:04.893 --> 01:10:05.394
[SPEAKER_28]: It's pretty cool.

01:10:05.774 --> 01:10:07.295
[SPEAKER_09]: God damn, I feel important.

01:10:08.408 --> 01:10:16.969
[SPEAKER_24]: So yeah, that's pretty much all that's happened other than that DDRUK suffered a server crash.

01:10:17.410 --> 01:10:25.351
[SPEAKER_24]: But they say that they're pretty much done with the Ultramix 2 sim files and they should be released in a week or so, I think.

01:10:25.391 --> 01:10:26.131
[SPEAKER_24]: That's what I heard.

01:10:27.151 --> 01:10:32.452
[SPEAKER_24]: Because they're just finishing up the last bits of the beginner steps and that was pretty much all that was left.

01:10:32.812 --> 01:10:36.953
[SPEAKER_24]: So those should be coming out soon and DDR Maniacs is still down and

01:10:39.446 --> 01:10:40.487
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I think that's pretty much it.

01:10:41.307 --> 01:10:43.629
[SPEAKER_24]: So, nothing really ain't going on.

01:10:44.129 --> 01:10:48.371
[SPEAKER_24]: Just a dead... Everyone's still kind of coming off the holiday.

01:10:50.753 --> 01:10:51.113
[SPEAKER_24]: So, yeah.

01:10:53.334 --> 01:10:53.615
[SPEAKER_24]: Angel?

01:10:55.176 --> 01:10:55.776
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I can talk.

01:10:55.936 --> 01:10:56.576
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, my bad.

01:10:58.477 --> 01:11:12.441
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, actually, that new skin thing, the Technofiend skin, the third one, uh, Mikey and I, uh, BigRedPimp in the chat room, uh, we decided to try playing that online mode this week.

01:11:12.481 --> 01:11:13.262
[SPEAKER_10]: That was pretty weird.

01:11:14.002 --> 01:11:15.282
[SPEAKER_10]: He kicked my butt twice.

01:11:15.382 --> 01:11:16.102
[SPEAKER_28]: How does that work?

01:11:16.162 --> 01:11:18.483
[SPEAKER_28]: I haven't really, um, tried the online mode.

01:11:18.543 --> 01:11:21.244
[SPEAKER_28]: Is it... You have to, like... Is it laggy, or does it... No.

01:11:21.284 --> 01:11:21.504
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, really?

01:11:21.524 --> 01:11:21.604
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

01:11:22.102 --> 01:11:23.082
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's pretty good.

01:11:24.603 --> 01:11:30.086
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to put your own IP in it, and then you set up the server that way.

01:11:30.966 --> 01:11:35.849
[SPEAKER_10]: And then when people try to connect to it, they just put in your IP, and then it just works from there.

01:11:36.109 --> 01:11:36.709
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty cool.

01:11:37.469 --> 01:11:40.391
[SPEAKER_24]: There is a front end for all this, just so people know.

01:11:40.451 --> 01:11:40.911
[SPEAKER_24]: It's out there.

01:11:40.951 --> 01:11:45.313
[SPEAKER_24]: I can't remember the website, but there is a front end and an actual community base around it.

01:11:45.373 --> 01:11:47.494
[SPEAKER_24]: So if you search, you'll find it.

01:11:49.741 --> 01:11:50.561
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's in options.

01:11:50.701 --> 01:11:54.183
[SPEAKER_10]: Just go down to network and then, yeah.

01:11:54.223 --> 01:11:55.663
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty self-explanatory from there.

01:11:56.964 --> 01:11:57.304
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

01:11:59.205 --> 01:12:02.646
[SPEAKER_28]: If that's it for the sim news, then I think we're going to have ourselves a cage match.

01:12:02.686 --> 01:12:03.266
[SPEAKER_28]: How's that sound?

01:12:03.286 --> 01:12:04.167
[SPEAKER_23]: Cage match.

01:12:04.287 --> 01:12:05.247
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, let's have a cage match.

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:20.725
[SPEAKER_28]: Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, Loki put in the most panned song ever in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, getting a zero from every single person in the room, including himself.

01:12:22.106 --> 01:12:24.027
[SPEAKER_28]: Will he have his revenge this week?

01:12:24.187 --> 01:12:25.227
[SPEAKER_28]: We shall soon see.

01:12:26.928 --> 01:12:31.990
[SPEAKER_28]: The chatroom pick is now out because it got bumped out last week by Jamie's pick.

01:12:32.927 --> 01:12:42.818
[SPEAKER_28]: Which is a little song called Joe La Taxi And who knew that anybody liked anything French But our chat room apparently dug it It's like it's French as sung by a Japanese girl

01:12:43.174 --> 01:12:44.735
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, it's a cute song.

01:12:44.775 --> 01:12:45.556
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm kind of glad it won.

01:12:45.576 --> 01:12:46.156
[SPEAKER_28]: It was a cute one.

01:12:46.396 --> 01:12:46.797
[SPEAKER_09]: I like it.

01:12:47.097 --> 01:12:51.480
[SPEAKER_28]: And since the chatroom choice is out, it may come back.

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:53.962
[SPEAKER_28]: That option may come back in a later week, but not tonight.

01:12:54.502 --> 01:12:57.385
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm coming back in with a choice of my own, and we shall see.

01:12:57.845 --> 01:13:12.576
[SPEAKER_28]: And I've decided just now, after seeing what all the songs are in Cage Match tonight, I've decided just now, I took a poll in the room about which song they wanted to see me put in Cage Match tonight, and I've decided to go against that and do what I feel like doing.

01:13:13.681 --> 01:13:19.092
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, I took a poll, too, to see what song I should put in Cage Match, and you picked this one, so... Ah!

01:13:20.074 --> 01:13:20.515
[SPEAKER_24]: I laughed.

01:13:22.475 --> 01:13:23.255
[SPEAKER_28]: Very interesting.

01:13:23.335 --> 01:13:27.958
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, let's start off with a clip of last week's... Oh yes, a reminder on the way the cage match works.

01:13:28.438 --> 01:13:34.180
[SPEAKER_28]: It used to be songs that we think would be good in a DDR or other Bomani game, but now it's just kind of turned into whatever's cool.

01:13:34.621 --> 01:13:37.842
[SPEAKER_28]: Three songs, each host picks a song, puts it in the cage match.

01:13:38.362 --> 01:13:43.505
[SPEAKER_28]: You guys in the chat room, you have to be in the chat room to participate, www.orangehoundsradio.com, click on chat.

01:13:44.105 --> 01:13:56.586
[SPEAKER_28]: You guys in the chat room, vote for your favorite, and your favorite goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's 24-hour day, 7 days a week, Bomani Music and More program.

01:13:58.618 --> 01:13:59.338
[SPEAKER_28]: So let's have it.

01:13:59.739 --> 01:14:03.241
[SPEAKER_28]: First, you get a clip of last week's winner because you've already been hearing it all week long.

01:14:03.321 --> 01:14:03.821
[SPEAKER_28]: Here it is.

01:14:04.101 --> 01:14:05.822
[SPEAKER_28]: This is, and this is a long name.

01:14:05.862 --> 01:14:06.943
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm only going to say it once.

01:14:07.303 --> 01:14:11.985
[SPEAKER_28]: This is Aria Posey with Joe LaTaxi, the Jan Wayne remix radio cut.

01:14:12.045 --> 01:14:12.866
[SPEAKER_28]: It's last week's winner.

01:14:13.246 --> 01:14:14.347
[SPEAKER_28]: Joe LaTaxi for short.

01:14:14.807 --> 01:14:15.047
[SPEAKER_28]: Enjoy.

01:15:48.954 --> 01:15:50.339
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

01:16:32.501 --> 01:16:33.782
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, that was song number one.

01:16:34.843 --> 01:16:37.825
[SPEAKER_28]: And I'm only going to read this one more time because somebody missed the name.

01:16:38.165 --> 01:16:38.806
[SPEAKER_28]: Pay attention.

01:16:39.486 --> 01:16:44.269
[SPEAKER_28]: Aurea Posey with Joe LaTaxi, the Jan Wayne remix radio cut.

01:16:45.370 --> 01:16:45.871
[SPEAKER_26]: There you go.

01:16:46.411 --> 01:16:47.692
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's move into song number two.

01:16:47.812 --> 01:16:49.974
[SPEAKER_28]: Song number two is Loki's pick tonight.

01:16:51.515 --> 01:16:52.515
[SPEAKER_26]: What did you pick, Loki?

01:16:55.297 --> 01:17:00.081
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, everyone in the studio here voted for the wild card song and

01:17:00.874 --> 01:17:01.414
[SPEAKER_24]: Guess what?

01:17:02.435 --> 01:17:11.122
[SPEAKER_24]: You see, last week I put in a song by a group called ProdigyRemix.com that's the Girls' Ideotech remix.

01:17:11.722 --> 01:17:14.885
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, you didn't like that too much.

01:17:15.265 --> 01:17:15.866
[SPEAKER_24]: So you know what?

01:17:16.066 --> 01:17:17.146
[SPEAKER_24]: I said, fuck it.

01:17:17.587 --> 01:17:19.008
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't give a shit what you like.

01:17:19.548 --> 01:17:20.109
[SPEAKER_24]: So you know what?

01:17:20.269 --> 01:17:21.290
[SPEAKER_24]: I put in the original.

01:17:21.370 --> 01:17:23.231
[SPEAKER_24]: So fucking, you get Girls again.

01:17:23.411 --> 01:17:27.394
[SPEAKER_24]: And if I can find a goddamn another remix of this song, I will put it in next week too.

01:17:28.275 --> 01:17:28.815
[SPEAKER_24]: So suck it.

01:17:28.915 --> 01:17:29.436
[SPEAKER_24]: Here's Girls.

01:17:34.887 --> 01:17:39.190
[SPEAKER_26]: Song number two, Prodigy with Girls and Joy.

01:19:59.108 --> 01:19:59.809
Thank you for watching!

01:21:25.383 --> 01:21:26.288
Thanks for watching!

01:21:59.493 --> 01:22:02.074
[SPEAKER_26]: Jamie, your thoughts?

01:22:03.815 --> 01:22:05.275
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess it didn't make it on the air.

01:22:05.556 --> 01:22:10.677
[SPEAKER_09]: So that last part, I'm like, if you'd like to take a phone call, please sign up and try it again.

01:22:10.997 --> 01:22:11.818
[SPEAKER_09]: Or deposit 25 cents.

01:22:11.918 --> 01:22:16.059
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually like that one a whole lot better.

01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:19.381
[SPEAKER_09]: But it has some annoying parts, so it gets like a 6.

01:22:20.881 --> 01:22:21.261
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, 6.

01:22:21.421 --> 01:22:22.382
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a 0.

01:22:22.942 --> 01:22:23.442
[SPEAKER_28]: 6 from Jamie.

01:22:23.482 --> 01:22:24.342
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm actually surprised.

01:22:24.582 --> 01:22:25.103
[SPEAKER_28]: 6 from Jamie.

01:22:25.863 --> 01:22:26.163
[SPEAKER_28]: Angel.

01:22:26.183 --> 01:22:26.283
[SPEAKER_28]: Angel.

01:22:27.771 --> 01:22:29.352
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna be nice and give it a four.

01:22:29.412 --> 01:22:31.674
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't as bad as last week, so whatever.

01:22:32.815 --> 01:22:33.335
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I know.

01:22:33.675 --> 01:22:33.976
[SPEAKER_23]: Shit.

01:22:34.276 --> 01:22:38.099
[SPEAKER_23]: Angel gives everything like a nine or a ten, and she gave that a four.

01:22:38.359 --> 01:22:39.259
[SPEAKER_23]: That's not nice.

01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:41.941
[SPEAKER_10]: It's better than zero.

01:22:41.961 --> 01:22:43.002
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, you got a point.

01:22:43.082 --> 01:22:43.723
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, Loki.

01:22:45.124 --> 01:22:46.865
[SPEAKER_24]: It gets a girls, because...

01:22:47.529 --> 01:23:16.026
[SPEAKER_24]: I want everyone every time they hear the word girls to think of this song and it will be foreverly imprinted on your brain you'll never be able to forget the song no matter how bad it sucks it will just stick with you like the goddamn ketchup song and milkshake song it's just gonna it's just everybody's gonna hear girls and just think of that so it's gonna be brainwashed into your head anyways I give it a hundred because it's awesome

01:23:16.770 --> 01:23:19.132
[SPEAKER_24]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:23:36.562 --> 01:23:51.135
[SPEAKER_28]: and you put it in a nice shoebox and you put that shoebox in nice wrapping and then you paint it with glitter and then you tie it up in a nice little bow and then you put a little ribbon on it and it's a little sparkling and then you put, you know, you plate it in gold and then you cover it in money.

01:23:51.676 --> 01:23:54.318
[SPEAKER_28]: You still have dog shit!

01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:58.802
[SPEAKER_28]: But it wasn't as bad as last week so I give it a one.

01:23:59.543 --> 01:24:00.924
[SPEAKER_09]: That's more like a dog fart.

01:24:01.985 --> 01:24:02.365
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

01:24:05.131 --> 01:24:05.591
[SPEAKER_28]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:24:23.326 --> 01:24:24.566
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to go with this one.

01:24:25.107 --> 01:24:28.628
[SPEAKER_28]: I cannot let Prodigy win, so I've got to bring out the big guns.

01:24:29.248 --> 01:24:31.288
[SPEAKER_28]: And I truly think this is the better song.

01:24:31.348 --> 01:24:33.209
[SPEAKER_28]: It's one I've been listening to in my car all week.

01:24:33.629 --> 01:24:36.730
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a group called Flower Power is the name of the group.

01:24:37.230 --> 01:24:38.891
[SPEAKER_28]: And they have a guest singer on this one.

01:24:39.391 --> 01:24:40.151
[SPEAKER_28]: It's Danny Minow.

01:24:40.911 --> 01:24:41.372
[SPEAKER_10]: No!

01:24:41.632 --> 01:24:41.872
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

01:24:42.732 --> 01:24:42.892
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

01:24:43.254 --> 01:24:45.095
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, another Mario reference.

01:24:45.175 --> 01:24:46.096
[SPEAKER_10]: Please kill me.

01:24:46.516 --> 01:24:47.056
[SPEAKER_28]: Here we go.

01:24:47.476 --> 01:24:48.697
[SPEAKER_28]: This is Danny Minow.

01:24:48.837 --> 01:24:52.999
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry, it's Flower Power featuring Danny Minow with a song called You Won't Forget About Me.

01:24:53.279 --> 01:24:53.559
[SPEAKER_28]: Enjoy.

01:25:38.728 --> 01:25:48.683
I'm breathing in deep, let it go, now I don't know It's good to know, yeah it's good to know that you

01:26:28.744 --> 01:26:29.505
Thank you.

01:27:29.251 --> 01:27:31.113
Thanks for watching!

01:28:41.067 --> 01:28:41.347
[SPEAKER_28]: Oops.

01:28:42.668 --> 01:28:44.188
[SPEAKER_28]: You got a little bit of my next song in there.

01:28:45.469 --> 01:28:46.249
[SPEAKER_28]: That's for next week.

01:28:46.309 --> 01:28:46.809
[SPEAKER_28]: No, I'm kidding.

01:28:48.330 --> 01:28:51.391
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, that was Danny Minow with You Won't Forget About Me.

01:28:52.051 --> 01:28:56.233
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see if we won't be able to forget that song or if we'd rather would forget it.

01:28:56.473 --> 01:28:56.753
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie.

01:28:57.453 --> 01:28:58.133
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't bad.

01:28:58.193 --> 01:28:58.734
[SPEAKER_09]: It didn't suck.

01:28:58.774 --> 01:28:59.314
[SPEAKER_09]: It gets an eight.

01:29:00.294 --> 01:29:00.614
[SPEAKER_28]: Angel.

01:29:02.855 --> 01:29:03.535
[SPEAKER_10]: Ow.

01:29:04.156 --> 01:29:04.736
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Danny.

01:29:05.196 --> 01:29:06.836
[SPEAKER_10]: Nine.

01:29:07.717 --> 01:29:07.997
[SPEAKER_24]: Loki.

01:29:10.017 --> 01:29:11.218
[SPEAKER_24]: I forgot about the song.

01:29:11.638 --> 01:29:13.200
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry, Danny Minow sucks.

01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:16.022
[SPEAKER_24]: It's just a fucking clone of Kylie Minow.

01:29:16.242 --> 01:29:17.083
[SPEAKER_24]: So, you know what?

01:29:17.904 --> 01:29:18.364
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't like it.

01:29:18.905 --> 01:29:19.225
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

01:29:19.365 --> 01:29:19.845
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a four.

01:29:22.828 --> 01:29:24.710
[SPEAKER_28]: I like that song because it's very disco.

01:29:25.010 --> 01:29:26.451
[SPEAKER_28]: And it has a very catchy hook.

01:29:26.491 --> 01:29:29.354
[SPEAKER_28]: And I don't care if you didn't like it tonight, which most of you in the chatroom didn't.

01:29:30.034 --> 01:29:31.716
[SPEAKER_28]: You won't be able to forget that song come tomorrow.

01:29:31.736 --> 01:29:32.897
[SPEAKER_28]: You'll be thinking about that hook.

01:29:34.018 --> 01:29:35.239
[SPEAKER_28]: I promise you this.

01:29:35.739 --> 01:29:36.440
[SPEAKER_28]: I promise you...

01:29:39.110 --> 01:29:40.971
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll see, we'll see what they remember come tomorrow.

01:29:41.452 --> 01:29:43.253
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright guys, it's time to vote.

01:29:45.314 --> 01:29:51.779
[SPEAKER_28]: But after this quick recap of the songs you can vote for tonight, song number one, Joe LaTaxi.

01:30:02.727 --> 01:30:05.289
[SPEAKER_28]: Song number two, Prodigy with Girls.

01:30:13.780 --> 01:30:20.125
[SPEAKER_28]: And song number three you can vote for tonight is Flower Power featuring Danny Minow, You Won't Forget About Me.

01:30:29.431 --> 01:30:32.474
[SPEAKER_28]: Place, vote, now.

01:30:32.614 --> 01:30:41.160
[SPEAKER_28]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote for either song number one, song number two, or song number three.

01:30:42.566 --> 01:30:43.408
[SPEAKER_28]: Don't vote for song number two.

01:30:55.450 --> 01:30:59.951
[SPEAKER_24]: and if this doesn't win, I have more girls to go in for next week.

01:31:00.731 --> 01:31:03.392
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie, we need to institute some new rule against that.

01:31:04.512 --> 01:31:09.473
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie, help me come up with a rule so Loki cannot put in another remix of Girls next week if he loses.

01:31:10.534 --> 01:31:12.254
[SPEAKER_09]: The other veto power.

01:31:12.974 --> 01:31:13.635
[SPEAKER_28]: The veto power?

01:31:13.655 --> 01:31:14.255
[SPEAKER_09]: The veto power.

01:31:14.335 --> 01:31:17.615
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, veto power's in.

01:31:18.356 --> 01:31:19.156
[SPEAKER_28]: And let's take a vote.

01:31:19.216 --> 01:31:20.976
[SPEAKER_28]: Who votes that we do the veto power next week?

01:31:21.837 --> 01:31:23.597
[SPEAKER_28]: And who votes we don't do the veto power next week?

01:31:24.244 --> 01:31:24.985
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh shit!

01:31:25.005 --> 01:31:27.547
[SPEAKER_09]: Sucks to be you.

01:31:29.388 --> 01:31:33.251
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I actually kind of liked the original.

01:31:34.192 --> 01:31:37.815
[SPEAKER_28]: To Loki's credit, the original wasn't as bad as the one last week.

01:31:38.055 --> 01:31:38.896
[SPEAKER_28]: But it was still pretty bad.

01:31:40.231 --> 01:31:40.491
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

01:31:41.052 --> 01:31:44.454
[SPEAKER_28]: I just... We've got to encourage Loki to expand his horizons.

01:31:44.834 --> 01:31:47.196
[SPEAKER_28]: But then he's just going to go and put echo image in or something.

01:31:49.158 --> 01:31:49.558
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll see.

01:31:50.879 --> 01:31:52.340
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll see what... Oh, and look at the chat room.

01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:53.941
[SPEAKER_28]: They're all raising their hands as well.

01:31:54.301 --> 01:31:55.022
[SPEAKER_28]: Too bad they don't get a vote.

01:31:55.402 --> 01:31:55.722
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

01:31:57.304 --> 01:31:58.104
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll see what happens.

01:31:58.304 --> 01:31:58.484
[SPEAKER_28]: What?

01:31:59.205 --> 01:31:59.825
[SPEAKER_24]: They get a vote?

01:32:00.866 --> 01:32:01.987
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, they get their vote right now.

01:32:02.047 --> 01:32:03.588
[SPEAKER_28]: They're voting for their favorite song.

01:32:03.688 --> 01:32:06.971
[SPEAKER_28]: Either Joe LaTaxi or Girls or Danny.

01:32:07.031 --> 01:32:07.451
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll see.

01:32:08.332 --> 01:32:08.632
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

01:32:09.463 --> 01:32:13.045
[SPEAKER_28]: Moving on, what else is going on in the gaming world right now?

01:32:13.365 --> 01:32:15.886
[SPEAKER_28]: You talked about that you'd actually played some Bomani this week, Jamie?

01:32:16.586 --> 01:32:17.526
[SPEAKER_28]: Just 2DX.

01:32:18.107 --> 01:32:20.148
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, I thought you'd actually gone out to the arcade or something.

01:32:20.888 --> 01:32:21.108
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

01:32:22.909 --> 01:32:23.749
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't had time.

01:32:24.209 --> 01:32:29.211
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, I want to go out to the arcade, but I can't get my motivation.

01:32:29.571 --> 01:32:32.213
[SPEAKER_09]: I've actually been tempted to re-download BM98.

01:32:32.993 --> 01:32:33.413
[SPEAKER_28]: Why's that?

01:32:33.673 --> 01:32:34.654
[SPEAKER_09]: Just because I miss it.

01:32:34.794 --> 01:32:35.494
[SPEAKER_09]: It feels fun.

01:32:36.912 --> 01:32:38.212
[SPEAKER_28]: What was so great about it?

01:32:38.232 --> 01:32:42.813
[SPEAKER_09]: Just the fact that you could... It was the Metal Gear song, but it had the whole first level of Metal Gear.

01:32:45.574 --> 01:32:45.894
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

01:32:49.535 --> 01:32:52.036
[SPEAKER_28]: I need to go out to the arcade sometime this week and play some DDR.

01:32:52.056 --> 01:32:53.636
[SPEAKER_28]: We should have like a DDR night or something.

01:32:54.996 --> 01:32:55.816
[SPEAKER_28]: I know, I know.

01:32:57.437 --> 01:32:57.977
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, well...

01:32:58.991 --> 01:33:00.912
[SPEAKER_28]: G, I guess we're going to take a break.

01:33:00.992 --> 01:33:03.894
[SPEAKER_28]: And when we come back from the break, we'll find out who won Cage Match.

01:33:04.214 --> 01:33:07.276
[SPEAKER_28]: And we will have ourselves a list list for this evening.

01:33:07.356 --> 01:33:08.396
[SPEAKER_28]: So be thinking about that.

01:33:10.317 --> 01:33:10.537
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob.

01:33:10.717 --> 01:33:10.898
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

01:33:11.098 --> 01:33:11.278
[SPEAKER_28]: Rob.

01:33:11.378 --> 01:33:11.538
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

01:33:11.838 --> 01:33:11.998
[SPEAKER_28]: What?

01:33:12.098 --> 01:33:12.238
[SPEAKER_28]: Rob.

01:33:12.278 --> 01:33:12.418
[SPEAKER_28]: What?

01:33:12.438 --> 01:33:12.578
[SPEAKER_28]: Rob.

01:33:12.638 --> 01:33:12.739
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi.

01:33:12.759 --> 01:33:12.939
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

01:33:12.999 --> 01:33:13.459
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

01:33:23.877 --> 01:33:26.958
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to take a break when we come back to tonight's version of Listless.

01:33:27.418 --> 01:33:39.660
[SPEAKER_28]: And if you guys would like to start making suggestions for tonight's Listless, tonight's Listless topic is video game we would most like to see in 2005.

01:33:40.860 --> 01:33:45.181
[SPEAKER_28]: Now that doesn't mean it has to actually be a game that has been announced, although it could be.

01:33:45.761 --> 01:33:46.661
[SPEAKER_28]: You could make something up.

01:33:46.961 --> 01:33:51.002
[SPEAKER_28]: But just video game I most want to see so I can buy it in 2005.

01:33:51.042 --> 01:33:51.902
[SPEAKER_28]: That's tonight's topic.

01:33:52.719 --> 01:33:59.708
[SPEAKER_28]: When we come back from this break of music featuring songs from DDR Solo, because I just want an excuse to play Temple of Love.

01:34:01.310 --> 01:34:03.393
[SPEAKER_28]: So we'll be back after this.

01:34:04.054 --> 01:34:04.375
[SPEAKER_28]: Enjoy.

01:34:06.237 --> 01:34:07.679
[SPEAKER_28]: And don't forget, vote on tonight's cage match.

01:34:15.442 --> 01:34:28.859
[SPEAKER_19]: You hear the priest that's trying to keep his god asleep Love's shining eternally, love will make you feel so free Come on girl, it's okay for satisfaction You must break the flame of passion In the blood that's shining in the temple of love

01:34:58.300 --> 01:34:59.181
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for watching!

01:36:03.479 --> 01:36:04.220
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for watching!

01:37:18.367 --> 01:37:22.482
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's dream a dream together A dream that is real

01:39:29.223 --> 01:39:29.944
[SPEAKER_17]: I wanna rock!

01:40:08.570 --> 01:40:09.531
[SPEAKER_27]: Gaming Radio.

01:40:09.751 --> 01:40:17.055
[SPEAKER_27]: So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

01:40:17.215 --> 01:40:18.555
[SPEAKER_27]: Orange Lounge Radio.

01:40:23.758 --> 01:40:25.739
[SPEAKER_28]: We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:40:28.161 --> 01:40:29.061
[SPEAKER_28]: Tom Brokaw, our buddy.

01:40:29.882 --> 01:40:31.082
[SPEAKER_28]: We miss him already, don't we?

01:40:31.122 --> 01:40:32.443
[SPEAKER_28]: That other guy is not quite as cool.

01:40:32.963 --> 01:40:33.263
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

01:40:33.604 --> 01:40:36.025
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, you guys ready to hear who won tonight's cage match?

01:40:36.045 --> 01:40:37.726
[SPEAKER_28]: Sure.

01:40:37.746 --> 01:40:37.926
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

01:40:37.946 --> 01:40:38.026
[SPEAKER_28]: Sure.

01:40:38.424 --> 01:40:41.746
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll tell you what guys, it was a landslide vote.

01:40:42.387 --> 01:40:48.090
[SPEAKER_28]: Every song got a couple of votes, but tonight's winner was an absolute landslide.

01:40:48.190 --> 01:40:51.312
[SPEAKER_28]: Getting twice as many votes as the other two songs combined.

01:40:52.413 --> 01:40:53.694
[SPEAKER_28]: What do you think?

01:40:53.934 --> 01:40:55.395
[SPEAKER_28]: All that being said, who do you think won it?

01:40:57.436 --> 01:40:58.377
[SPEAKER_28]: Loki says my song.

01:40:58.397 --> 01:40:59.037
[SPEAKER_28]: What do you think, Jamie?

01:40:59.577 --> 01:41:00.238
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I don't care.

01:41:00.598 --> 01:41:01.138
[SPEAKER_28]: I think you don't care.

01:41:01.158 --> 01:41:01.759
[SPEAKER_28]: What do you think, Loki?

01:41:02.639 --> 01:41:03.700
[SPEAKER_09]: I already told you I thought.

01:41:03.820 --> 01:41:04.440
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh yeah, just kidding.

01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:05.201
[SPEAKER_28]: Angel, what do you think?

01:41:07.226 --> 01:41:08.406
[SPEAKER_28]: I already know, so I can't say.

01:41:10.108 --> 01:41:13.350
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess I'll say... Oh, God.

01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:16.252
[SPEAKER_10]: It's either a toss-up between Jamie's or yours.

01:41:16.593 --> 01:41:17.433
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, well, let's see.

01:41:17.533 --> 01:41:21.816
[SPEAKER_28]: Tonight's cage match winner is... Dome of Taxi!

01:41:21.917 --> 01:41:23.218
[SPEAKER_28]: Holy shit!

01:41:23.398 --> 01:41:23.858
[SPEAKER_28]: Cool!

01:41:25.439 --> 01:41:27.160
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually kind of thought it would be yours.

01:41:27.461 --> 01:41:29.983
[SPEAKER_28]: Blew the other two songs out of the freaking water.

01:41:31.784 --> 01:41:33.205
[SPEAKER_28]: Got two more where that came from, baby.

01:41:33.584 --> 01:41:34.786
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thank you, chat room.

01:41:34.806 --> 01:41:35.627
[SPEAKER_09]: You really love me.

01:41:36.027 --> 01:41:36.989
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

01:41:37.389 --> 01:41:41.374
[SPEAKER_28]: Actually, I'm not so sure if it's that they love you as they hated the other two songs.

01:41:41.394 --> 01:41:42.836
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I know your song was kind of cool.

01:41:42.916 --> 01:41:43.517
[SPEAKER_09]: I liked it.

01:41:43.637 --> 01:41:43.958
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

01:41:45.219 --> 01:41:47.783
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, so Jolitaxi wins it two weeks in a row.

01:41:49.048 --> 01:41:49.408
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

01:41:50.029 --> 01:41:51.250
[SPEAKER_28]: Loki's going to keep trying, though.

01:41:51.290 --> 01:41:54.152
[SPEAKER_28]: He wants to put girls up again next week, so we'll see what happens.

01:41:54.612 --> 01:41:56.333
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to tell you, you're going to keep losing, too.

01:41:57.254 --> 01:41:59.435
[SPEAKER_09]: Yet another week I don't have to pick a song.

01:41:59.615 --> 01:42:00.596
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, everybody.

01:42:01.717 --> 01:42:06.560
[SPEAKER_28]: We haven't had a two-week winner since, well, Gwen Stefani wasn't that long ago, I suppose.

01:42:07.180 --> 01:42:08.661
[SPEAKER_28]: That was the last song we had to retire.

01:42:10.390 --> 01:42:10.890
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, alright.

01:42:11.531 --> 01:42:14.272
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's get into tonight's list list.

01:42:14.352 --> 01:42:28.300
[SPEAKER_28]: Now, let's explain the way list list works, because I know a lot of you guys are new to Orange Lounge Radio, whether it be through the DDR Freak repeats, which are on Friday nights at 6 o'clock, if you ever miss this show, by the way, on DDR Freak Radio, or through the podcast.

01:42:28.700 --> 01:42:30.981
[SPEAKER_28]: So it's very possible you haven't heard list list before.

01:42:31.041 --> 01:42:31.862
[SPEAKER_28]: Basically what we do...

01:42:32.617 --> 01:42:34.458
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for watching!

01:42:51.678 --> 01:42:57.759
[SPEAKER_28]: So tonight's list is going to be video game you most want to see in 2005.

01:42:58.099 --> 01:43:00.079
[SPEAKER_28]: And this can be something that's already been announced.

01:43:00.620 --> 01:43:04.960
[SPEAKER_28]: This could be something that you just dream about.

01:43:05.660 --> 01:43:06.901
[SPEAKER_28]: It could be just about anything.

01:43:06.921 --> 01:43:08.541
[SPEAKER_28]: We're really not setting any limits on this.

01:43:08.601 --> 01:43:10.241
[SPEAKER_28]: So let's see what everybody comes up with.

01:43:11.041 --> 01:43:16.042
[SPEAKER_28]: But in order to do list list properly, we have to bring in our game show announcer and our game show music.

01:43:16.082 --> 01:43:17.382
[SPEAKER_28]: So you guys ready to do some list list?

01:43:17.802 --> 01:43:18.022
[SPEAKER_28]: What?

01:43:18.323 --> 01:43:18.663
[SPEAKER_28]: Sure.

01:43:19.123 --> 01:43:19.603
[SPEAKER_28]: What was that?

01:43:19.743 --> 01:43:20.143
[SPEAKER_28]: Nothing.

01:43:20.583 --> 01:43:21.103
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, here we go.

01:43:21.670 --> 01:43:23.211
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's bring in our game show announcer.

01:43:42.825 --> 01:43:44.266
[SPEAKER_23]: That's right, everybody.

01:43:44.806 --> 01:43:47.348
[SPEAKER_23]: It's time to play Listless.

01:43:48.129 --> 01:43:53.212
[SPEAKER_23]: Remember, in order to participate in the listless segment, you have to be in our chat room!

01:43:54.033 --> 01:44:06.181
[SPEAKER_23]: www.orangelearnradio.com Tonight, we're going to come up with the definitive list for a video game we most want to see in 2005!

01:44:07.161 --> 01:44:12.225
[SPEAKER_23]: Helping us come up with tonight's list, say hello to DarkSakura!

01:44:13.145 --> 01:44:13.746
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi!

01:44:15.172 --> 01:44:19.135
[SPEAKER_23]: And say hello to the inventor of Rice-A-Roni, Loki!

01:44:20.756 --> 01:44:21.616
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh, no.

01:44:23.357 --> 01:44:27.040
[SPEAKER_23]: Also helping us out, say hello to DDRangel!

01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:27.740
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello.

01:44:29.641 --> 01:44:31.442
[SPEAKER_23]: And say hello to Skye!

01:44:31.943 --> 01:44:32.243
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

01:44:33.384 --> 01:44:34.544
[SPEAKER_23]: Hey, Mr. Announcer!

01:44:34.825 --> 01:44:36.446
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, DarkSakura!

01:44:37.206 --> 01:44:39.748
[SPEAKER_23]: Did you ever get this shoe removed from your butt?

01:44:40.914 --> 01:44:43.136
[SPEAKER_23]: I have no idea what you're talking about!

01:45:05.788 --> 01:45:06.808
[SPEAKER_28]: Why the hell not?

01:45:06.848 --> 01:45:08.989
[SPEAKER_28]: You always start off these segments, so why not?

01:45:09.049 --> 01:45:09.709
[SPEAKER_28]: Why the hell not?

01:45:09.749 --> 01:45:11.710
[SPEAKER_28]: You're number three pick.

01:45:12.370 --> 01:45:13.691
[SPEAKER_09]: Pimp My Ride the game.

01:45:14.931 --> 01:45:23.894
[SPEAKER_09]: After all, you know, and all of those racing games they have where you can customize your car and everything, they just need a game of nothing but that, because that's the most fun.

01:45:24.954 --> 01:45:26.275
[SPEAKER_09]: Pimp My Ride the game.

01:45:26.335 --> 01:45:27.895
[SPEAKER_28]: Pimp My Ride the game.

01:45:27.955 --> 01:45:28.916
[SPEAKER_28]: That's pretty creative.

01:45:28.936 --> 01:45:29.716
[SPEAKER_28]: I've got to give that to you.

01:45:29.736 --> 01:45:30.216
[SPEAKER_28]: That's good.

01:45:30.716 --> 01:45:31.096
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

01:45:31.656 --> 01:45:33.077
[SPEAKER_24]: Loki, you're number three pick.

01:45:35.492 --> 01:45:37.933
[SPEAKER_24]: This one just came to me now, just like an epiphany.

01:45:39.433 --> 01:45:49.657
[SPEAKER_24]: This one is going to have similar gameplay to Katamari Damacy.

01:45:51.237 --> 01:45:56.819
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it would be very popular because everybody has these, they can identify with them.

01:45:57.739 --> 01:46:00.480
[SPEAKER_24]: It's Roll My SUV The Game.

01:46:04.704 --> 01:46:06.866
[SPEAKER_24]: Because, you know, those SUVs, they like to roll.

01:46:08.727 --> 01:46:10.889
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't get it or something.

01:46:10.909 --> 01:46:14.552
[SPEAKER_28]: Can you explain the joke, please, for the mentally challenged such as myself?

01:46:15.673 --> 01:46:26.643
[SPEAKER_24]: Giant fucking vehicles that have no point in being on a road, and people drive them around like they're race cars, and well, since they have a high center of balance, they tend to roll.

01:46:27.424 --> 01:46:31.467
[SPEAKER_24]: Like, as in flip over, as in crash, explode, people die.

01:46:31.687 --> 01:46:32.288
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds like Burnout 3.

01:46:33.902 --> 01:46:34.682
[SPEAKER_24]: Sounds like Driver 3.

01:46:35.643 --> 01:46:37.923
[SPEAKER_28]: Angel, your number three pick, please.

01:46:38.083 --> 01:46:47.806
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say Actraiser DS just because I was being serious, but I think I need to steal K-Dash's suggestion, which was DDR Dimash.

01:46:49.487 --> 01:46:50.407
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it sounded funny.

01:46:51.447 --> 01:46:53.928
[SPEAKER_28]: And how exactly does DDR Dimash work?

01:46:55.029 --> 01:46:57.509
[SPEAKER_10]: I have no idea, but it sounded funny at the time.

01:46:57.629 --> 01:46:58.230
[SPEAKER_10]: So you know what?

01:46:58.270 --> 01:46:59.550
[SPEAKER_10]: He gets a cookie for that one.

01:47:01.084 --> 01:47:01.964
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, fair enough.

01:47:02.524 --> 01:47:06.286
[SPEAKER_28]: My number three pick, I actually went with a serious one, heaven forbid.

01:47:06.846 --> 01:47:09.646
[SPEAKER_28]: This is a game that has needed to come out for about the past ten years.

01:47:10.527 --> 01:47:11.227
[SPEAKER_28]: Kid Icarus 2005.

01:47:11.447 --> 01:47:13.348
[SPEAKER_09]: Holy shit, yeah.

01:47:17.149 --> 01:47:19.489
[SPEAKER_28]: I seriously, seriously don't get it.

01:47:19.829 --> 01:47:28.212
[SPEAKER_28]: Nintendo has this character, many people still know this character and love this character, and yet this character is yet to turn up in any type of Super Smash Bros.

01:47:28.232 --> 01:47:28.952
[SPEAKER_28]: game or anything.

01:47:29.617 --> 01:47:30.177
[SPEAKER_28]: What the hell?

01:47:30.297 --> 01:47:32.498
[SPEAKER_28]: They could do a kick-ass game with Kid Icarus.

01:47:32.738 --> 01:47:34.378
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe the next Animal Crossing?

01:47:36.098 --> 01:47:36.438
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know.

01:47:36.478 --> 01:47:36.919
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll see.

01:47:37.199 --> 01:47:38.139
[SPEAKER_28]: We will see what happens.

01:47:39.119 --> 01:47:39.539
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

01:47:41.019 --> 01:47:41.600
[SPEAKER_28]: Moving on.

01:47:42.380 --> 01:47:43.500
[SPEAKER_28]: Number two pick time.

01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:45.440
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie, your number two pick, please.

01:47:46.561 --> 01:47:48.001
[SPEAKER_09]: The Sims, Sims in the Hood.

01:47:48.961 --> 01:47:50.582
[SPEAKER_28]: The Sims, Sims in the Hood.

01:47:51.502 --> 01:47:52.702
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not meaning like the herbs.

01:47:52.882 --> 01:47:56.683
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean like we have ghetto Sims that have to go pick up their cheese.

01:47:59.821 --> 01:48:05.125
[SPEAKER_28]: And I'm going to spell that Sims with a Z. Oh, I did too.

01:48:05.665 --> 01:48:06.146
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, good.

01:48:06.226 --> 01:48:06.566
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

01:48:07.687 --> 01:48:08.568
[SPEAKER_28]: Sims in the hood.

01:48:10.229 --> 01:48:11.570
[SPEAKER_28]: Loki, your number two pick, please.

01:48:12.390 --> 01:48:14.152
[SPEAKER_24]: This one's a request by Nelly.

01:48:14.232 --> 01:48:16.373
[SPEAKER_24]: She wants the girl game.

01:48:17.334 --> 01:48:21.617
[SPEAKER_24]: Much like the guy game, but, you know, no breasts and more cock shots.

01:48:23.018 --> 01:48:27.081
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, funny you should mention this, because something similar is going to come up on my list, but we'll see.

01:48:28.082 --> 01:48:29.303
[SPEAKER_28]: Angel, your number two pick.

01:48:30.127 --> 01:48:35.892
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I was just looking at the poster over there and I just had to giggle at myself because I just picked something completely at random.

01:48:37.033 --> 01:48:39.275
[SPEAKER_10]: Except I don't know if I want to call it one thing or the other.

01:48:39.395 --> 01:48:45.740
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I was either going to say Kill Bill Online or something just because I was just being completely random.

01:48:45.860 --> 01:48:47.801
[SPEAKER_28]: So Kill Bill the game or Kill Bill Online?

01:48:50.083 --> 01:48:50.303
Oops.

01:48:50.664 --> 01:48:51.824
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh oh.

01:48:51.925 --> 01:48:53.626
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

01:48:53.646 --> 01:48:54.847
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to think of something new now.

01:48:55.027 --> 01:48:55.968
[SPEAKER_09]: I had Kill Bill the RPG.

01:48:56.974 --> 01:48:58.274
[SPEAKER_09]: That would have been cooler, see?

01:48:58.394 --> 01:48:59.535
[SPEAKER_28]: You still would have gotten props from me.

01:48:59.555 --> 01:49:01.355
[SPEAKER_28]: So do you want Kill Bill the RPG Angel?

01:49:01.835 --> 01:49:02.056
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

01:49:02.616 --> 01:49:05.217
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, and she just stole Jamie's just like that.

01:49:05.837 --> 01:49:06.457
[SPEAKER_28]: What a bitch.

01:49:06.477 --> 01:49:07.257
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate you.

01:49:07.377 --> 01:49:07.797
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

01:49:09.458 --> 01:49:11.879
[SPEAKER_28]: My number two pick is another serious one.

01:49:13.099 --> 01:49:13.839
[SPEAKER_28]: Heaven forbid.

01:49:14.599 --> 01:49:19.141
[SPEAKER_28]: I would like to see a true sequel to Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

01:49:19.561 --> 01:49:21.421
[SPEAKER_28]: And I'm not talking those 3D bullshit.

01:49:21.561 --> 01:49:21.982
[SPEAKER_28]: I want a 2D...

01:49:24.028 --> 01:49:31.569
[SPEAKER_28]: Beautiful, I don't care what they do, I want a 2D Castlevania game that just fucking sleeps with me, it's that good.

01:49:32.750 --> 01:49:34.870
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'm going to call it Castlevania Symphony of the Night 2.

01:49:36.750 --> 01:49:38.111
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm done, actually.

01:49:38.291 --> 01:49:39.011
[SPEAKER_09]: Announce for the DC.

01:49:40.651 --> 01:49:40.891
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

01:49:41.931 --> 01:49:46.092
[SPEAKER_28]: Then that is the game I most, no, okay, then I'm going to be specific.

01:49:46.712 --> 01:49:48.132
[SPEAKER_28]: On PS2.

01:49:48.592 --> 01:49:50.273
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sick of this handheld bullshit.

01:49:50.353 --> 01:49:51.353
[SPEAKER_28]: I want one on a console.

01:49:52.673 --> 01:49:54.374
[SPEAKER_09]: Put it on a good system and put it on the Xbox.

01:49:54.614 --> 01:49:55.735
[SPEAKER_09]: So it'll actually look good.

01:49:56.435 --> 01:49:57.036
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't give a shit.

01:49:57.116 --> 01:49:57.616
[SPEAKER_28]: I just want it.

01:49:57.836 --> 01:49:59.617
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't want it on a freaking handheld.

01:49:59.657 --> 01:50:06.201
[SPEAKER_28]: I want it on the big TV so I can turn up the speakers and blast the shit out of the Castlevania music.

01:50:08.762 --> 01:50:09.422
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyway, moving on.

01:50:11.083 --> 01:50:12.924
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie, did you manage to find a new number one?

01:50:13.265 --> 01:50:14.065
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I guess so.

01:50:14.145 --> 01:50:15.246
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, what is your new number one?

01:50:15.806 --> 01:50:17.087
[SPEAKER_09]: Console Ragnarok Online.

01:50:18.327 --> 01:50:19.328
[SPEAKER_09]: Fully customizable.

01:50:23.027 --> 01:50:25.048
[SPEAKER_28]: Ragnarok Online to your console.

01:50:25.328 --> 01:50:25.728
[SPEAKER_28]: Beautiful.

01:50:26.989 --> 01:50:27.969
[SPEAKER_28]: Angel, you're number one.

01:50:28.869 --> 01:50:29.390
[SPEAKER_28]: You don't have one.

01:50:29.490 --> 01:50:30.750
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, sorry, Loki, you're number one.

01:50:32.531 --> 01:50:33.071
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, man.

01:50:35.252 --> 01:50:35.772
[SPEAKER_24]: Let's see.

01:50:35.812 --> 01:50:37.233
[SPEAKER_24]: What would be a good game?

01:50:40.314 --> 01:50:41.334
[SPEAKER_24]: I know, I know, I know.

01:50:41.955 --> 01:50:43.395
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, let's... No, actually, that's going to suck.

01:50:43.415 --> 01:50:45.536
[SPEAKER_27]: You're supposed to prep these.

01:50:46.316 --> 01:50:46.876
[SPEAKER_24]: You know what?

01:50:47.597 --> 01:50:48.117
[SPEAKER_24]: God damn it.

01:50:48.641 --> 01:50:49.281
[SPEAKER_24]: How about this?

01:50:49.341 --> 01:50:50.441
[SPEAKER_24]: This is going to be my game.

01:50:50.481 --> 01:50:53.302
[SPEAKER_24]: It's called Get Off Your Ass and Get a Job, the game.

01:50:55.483 --> 01:51:01.184
[SPEAKER_24]: This will teach those fat fuckers that play games all the time to fucking get off their ass, go outside and get a job.

01:51:01.244 --> 01:51:03.705
[SPEAKER_24]: And provide for your family.

01:51:06.105 --> 01:51:10.026
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not about leveling your fucking character, it's about getting a goddamn job.

01:51:10.466 --> 01:51:11.226
[SPEAKER_24]: That's what it's about.

01:51:11.967 --> 01:51:15.167
[SPEAKER_24]: Seriously, who gives a shit if you're a level 50 monk?

01:51:15.707 --> 01:51:17.988
[SPEAKER_24]: You need to be earning some fucking cash.

01:51:19.711 --> 01:51:24.815
[SPEAKER_24]: You're going to have a family out there and just because you can slay dragons doesn't mean you can fucking provide.

01:51:25.416 --> 01:51:26.657
[SPEAKER_24]: So get a fucking job.

01:51:26.737 --> 01:51:27.217
[SPEAKER_24]: That's it.

01:51:28.338 --> 01:51:28.779
[SPEAKER_24]: That's my game.

01:51:30.300 --> 01:51:31.321
[SPEAKER_28]: Get out and get a job.

01:51:31.361 --> 01:51:31.821
[SPEAKER_28]: The game.

01:51:32.222 --> 01:51:32.582
[SPEAKER_28]: Lovely.

01:51:34.203 --> 01:51:37.166
[SPEAKER_28]: I wrote it down as get out and get a job.

01:51:37.206 --> 01:51:38.687
[SPEAKER_28]: You want get out and get a fucking job?

01:51:40.288 --> 01:51:41.990
[SPEAKER_09]: There are plenty of people who would like a job fucking.

01:51:42.030 --> 01:51:42.330
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

01:51:44.452 --> 01:51:46.674
[SPEAKER_28]: Now the ESRB may have problems with this.

01:51:48.635 --> 01:51:58.183
[SPEAKER_28]: That's why they put it out on Xbox Alright, get up off your ass and get a fucking job the game, alright Uh, Angel, did you come up with the new number one over there?

01:51:58.983 --> 01:52:17.918
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, Angel's number one Yeah, except I can't think of a city that I wanted to put in the name Happy Bunny Kills Everything, insert city name here Happy Bunny Kills Everything, the game Yes, I was trying to be random, leave me alone We're just gonna call it Happy Bunny Kills Everything, how's that?

01:52:19.238 --> 01:52:23.481
[SPEAKER_28]: And Angel, for those that may not know, what is Happy Bunny?

01:52:24.462 --> 01:52:25.143
[SPEAKER_28]: What is Happy Bunny?

01:52:25.383 --> 01:52:26.264
[SPEAKER_09]: My personal avatar.

01:52:27.384 --> 01:52:29.066
[SPEAKER_09]: Let Jamie do it because Jamie's cooler.

01:52:29.766 --> 01:52:30.067
[SPEAKER_25]: Jamie?

01:52:31.728 --> 01:52:38.193
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that my favorite Happy Bunny line is this cute little bunny you see just looking all happy, all sweet and everything.

01:52:38.573 --> 01:52:42.456
[SPEAKER_09]: My favorite one is, school prepares you for the real world, which also sucks.

01:52:43.857 --> 01:52:48.361
[SPEAKER_09]: Or my other favorite one is, you icky people are nice, but you gotta go.

01:52:49.548 --> 01:52:53.051
[SPEAKER_28]: Don't you think that Happy Bunny sold out a little bit thanks to Hot Topic?

01:52:53.872 --> 01:52:55.653
[SPEAKER_09]: A little, but Happy Bunny's still cool.

01:52:55.753 --> 01:52:57.695
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, all right.

01:52:57.895 --> 01:53:04.701
[SPEAKER_28]: And the last one is my number one pick, and it's very similar to one that Loki put in earlier, but I had a different idea.

01:53:05.461 --> 01:53:07.083
[SPEAKER_28]: You guys know the guy game, right?

01:53:07.463 --> 01:53:13.768
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, we need a game that caters to the other percentage of the male population, the gay guy game, and that is my number one pick.

01:53:17.612 --> 01:53:17.932
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

01:53:19.364 --> 01:53:21.786
[SPEAKER_28]: Now it's time for the elimination round.

01:53:22.586 --> 01:53:24.728
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's read the list that we have so far.

01:53:24.888 --> 01:53:30.412
[SPEAKER_28]: Each host will have to eliminate one song forever off of this list.

01:53:30.452 --> 01:53:30.872
[SPEAKER_28]: Here we go.

01:53:30.992 --> 01:53:33.374
[SPEAKER_28]: We have... What?

01:53:34.054 --> 01:53:34.775
[SPEAKER_24]: Not a song.

01:53:34.835 --> 01:53:35.255
[SPEAKER_24]: No, you're right.

01:53:35.275 --> 01:53:35.896
[SPEAKER_28]: It's not a song.

01:53:35.936 --> 01:53:37.577
[SPEAKER_28]: It's an item from the list.

01:53:37.617 --> 01:53:38.097
[SPEAKER_28]: Here we go.

01:53:39.878 --> 01:53:40.519
[SPEAKER_28]: Number one.

01:53:41.179 --> 01:53:43.501
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry, not number one, but first item on the list.

01:53:43.621 --> 01:53:45.182
[SPEAKER_28]: Pimp My Ride, the game.

01:53:46.103 --> 01:53:47.604
[SPEAKER_28]: Roll My SUV, the game.

01:53:48.365 --> 01:54:11.155
[SPEAKER_28]: DDR Dimashy, Kid Icarus 2005, The Sims, Sims and the Hood, The Girl Game, Kill Bill, the RPG, Castlevania Symphony of the Night 2, console please, Console Ragnarok Online, Get Up Off Your Ass and Get a Fucking Job, the game, Happy Bunny Kills Everything, and the Gay Guy game.

01:54:12.776 --> 01:54:13.756
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, Jamie?

01:54:13.776 --> 01:54:13.876
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie?

01:54:14.901 --> 01:54:16.422
[SPEAKER_28]: You get the first elimination.

01:54:16.462 --> 01:54:23.367
[SPEAKER_21]: What's coming off the list?

01:54:23.747 --> 01:54:33.614
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that I'm going to have to kick off... Goddamn.

01:54:33.654 --> 01:54:35.436
[SPEAKER_09]: Get off your ass and get a fucking job at the game.

01:54:35.636 --> 01:54:36.136
[SPEAKER_28]: Really?

01:54:37.357 --> 01:54:38.938
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, I would have thought this would have been your anthem.

01:54:39.018 --> 01:54:41.140
[SPEAKER_09]: It's sort of defeating the purpose.

01:54:42.714 --> 01:54:46.417
[SPEAKER_09]: You could play about getting a fucking job, but you could get a fucking job.

01:54:48.679 --> 01:54:50.180
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, defeat the purpose.

01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:51.101
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, Loki.

01:54:53.563 --> 01:54:59.408
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to have to take off Ragnarok Online, the console game, because that game sucks and doesn't deserve to be on console.

01:55:00.068 --> 01:55:01.469
[SPEAKER_24]: It's made by Koreans.

01:55:01.589 --> 01:55:04.972
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, the same can be said about Final Fantasy XI, which also sucks.

01:55:06.213 --> 01:55:07.714
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, but that's on a console already.

01:55:07.874 --> 01:55:08.395
[SPEAKER_24]: D'oh!

01:55:08.951 --> 01:55:09.772
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and it still sucks.

01:55:09.812 --> 01:55:11.493
[SPEAKER_28]: Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.

01:55:11.933 --> 01:55:13.094
[SPEAKER_28]: Ooh, take it outside.

01:55:13.134 --> 01:55:14.194
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's put it on webcam.

01:55:14.395 --> 01:55:15.415
[SPEAKER_28]: Kick the shit out of each other.

01:55:15.775 --> 01:55:17.397
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't go on webcam, and I would win.

01:55:17.617 --> 01:55:19.858
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

01:55:20.058 --> 01:55:20.719
[SPEAKER_28]: Angel, your turn.

01:55:20.799 --> 01:55:21.279
[SPEAKER_28]: One's got to go.

01:55:23.941 --> 01:55:25.382
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to pick my own, but never mind.

01:55:25.562 --> 01:55:27.143
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll just do Roll My SUV, the game.

01:55:27.163 --> 01:55:28.604
[SPEAKER_28]: Sorry, Loki.

01:55:28.624 --> 01:55:29.845
[SPEAKER_28]: Roll My SUV, the game.

01:55:29.865 --> 01:55:30.185
[SPEAKER_28]: You know what?

01:55:30.225 --> 01:55:32.106
[SPEAKER_28]: I was looking at that one, too, because I didn't get the joke either.

01:55:32.726 --> 01:55:36.289
[SPEAKER_28]: And I'm going to... I know, I get it.

01:55:36.469 --> 01:55:36.489
[SPEAKER_28]: I...

01:55:37.362 --> 01:55:46.208
[SPEAKER_28]: I will eliminate DDR Dimashy with respect to our chatroom because I know it was their idea, but I'm just not sure how to spell Dimashy, and I'm not going to make an ass out of myself.

01:55:46.969 --> 01:55:47.989
[SPEAKER_10]: It's okay, Rob.

01:55:51.012 --> 01:55:54.874
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, so we have a final list here, and you guys get to place your vote.

01:55:55.214 --> 01:56:00.238
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's bring back our own version of Don Pardo to read the choices you have to pick from.

[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, we have to do the FUs of the week.

01:57:20.989 --> 01:57:22.150
[SPEAKER_28]: But don't send those in just yet.

01:57:22.190 --> 01:57:23.930
[SPEAKER_28]: I want votes for listless first.

01:57:24.571 --> 01:57:26.612
[SPEAKER_28]: And then, I don't know.

01:57:26.992 --> 01:57:27.632

Wow, he's quite a personality.

[SPEAKER_02]: And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:04:52.015 --> 02:04:56.097
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.

02:04:56.118 --> 02:04:57.078
[SPEAKER_28]: Can we talk about that?

02:04:57.358 --> 02:04:59.700
[SPEAKER_21]: No subject will ever be taboo.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:03.642
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.

02:05:04.162 --> 02:05:06.684
[SPEAKER_28]: Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.

02:05:07.204 --> 02:05:12.547
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

02:05:13.107 --> 02:05:14.388
[SPEAKER_24]: I collect your fucking head.

02:05:16.337 --> 02:05:17.858
[SPEAKER_15]: Just like this fucker here.

02:05:18.938 --> 02:05:22.621
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?

02:05:22.901 --> 02:05:26.283
[SPEAKER_23]: The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

02:05:27.223 --> 02:05:33.667
[SPEAKER_17]: Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

02:05:34.867 --> 02:05:38.669
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

02:05:42.892 --> 02:05:44.953
[SPEAKER_28]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and...

02:05:45.615 --> 02:05:51.398
[SPEAKER_28]: We're about ready to reveal the winners of tonight's list list, the definitive list of games we most want to see in 2005.

02:05:52.318 --> 02:05:58.241
[SPEAKER_28]: It's very funny, though, because the chat room was just going off on these ideas about Orange Lounge Radio, the game.

02:05:59.541 --> 02:06:02.402
[SPEAKER_28]: Phoenix in the chat room says, Orange Lounge Radio, the game.

02:06:02.442 --> 02:06:12.627
[SPEAKER_28]: You could be one of the broadcasters, and then if Loki says something retarded or votes for a bad song, he would promptly be shot with an RPG or a large rifle.

02:06:12.707 --> 02:06:14.208
[SPEAKER_28]: Failure to do so will cause you to lose.

02:06:14.248 --> 02:06:15.008
[SPEAKER_28]: Hey, I like that idea.

02:06:17.168 --> 02:06:19.029
[SPEAKER_28]: And let's see, what else is it?

02:06:19.129 --> 02:06:24.891
[SPEAKER_28]: Jaded2005 says, make it an RPG where you guide the Orange Lawns Radio guys to the studio before the show starts.

02:06:25.291 --> 02:06:27.292
[SPEAKER_28]: K-Dash says, make sure they get there before 6.

02:06:28.092 --> 02:06:28.312
[SPEAKER_28]: Ha!

02:06:29.073 --> 02:06:34.655
[SPEAKER_28]: More like real life, make it before they get here by 6.32, because that's about what time they usually get here.

02:06:35.475 --> 02:06:36.035
[SPEAKER_28]: Hardy har.

02:06:37.696 --> 02:06:38.396
[SPEAKER_26]: Ah, funny stuff.

02:06:39.710 --> 02:06:43.832
[SPEAKER_28]: BlackDevilerX says, Orange Lens Radio, the game definitely belongs on the PlayStation 2.

02:06:44.532 --> 02:06:48.434
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, so we can be badly anti-alias just like all the rest of the games on PS2.

02:06:48.474 --> 02:06:49.055
[SPEAKER_28]: That'd be great.

02:06:49.255 --> 02:06:50.975
[SPEAKER_28]: We could look very pixelated on the edges.

02:06:51.236 --> 02:06:51.676
[SPEAKER_28]: Be hot.

02:06:52.396 --> 02:06:52.836
[SPEAKER_28]: Can't wait.

02:06:54.317 --> 02:06:56.678
[SPEAKER_28]: DarkSakura, what do you think of Orange Lens Radio, the game?

02:06:56.718 --> 02:06:57.639
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't care.

02:06:57.679 --> 02:06:58.339
[SPEAKER_28]: Get with the show.

02:07:01.260 --> 02:07:05.582
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that I would have to go around with hammers hitting people in the head with them in the game.

02:07:06.403 --> 02:07:06.703
[SPEAKER_28]: Love you.

02:07:07.773 --> 02:07:09.054
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, you can go back to the wedding talk now.

02:07:09.074 --> 02:07:09.634
[SPEAKER_28]: Girl talk.

02:07:10.475 --> 02:07:11.655
[SPEAKER_28]: With the silent Nelly.

02:07:12.396 --> 02:07:12.616
[SPEAKER_28]: Angel?

02:07:12.776 --> 02:07:14.497
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that mean I can kill everybody with halos?

02:07:14.537 --> 02:07:15.317
[SPEAKER_10]: Oops, did I say that?

02:07:16.818 --> 02:07:17.579
[SPEAKER_10]: And stuff.

02:07:18.699 --> 02:07:19.400
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm not funny.

02:07:19.720 --> 02:07:20.200
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, bye.

02:07:21.521 --> 02:07:27.605
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, let's get into tonight's winners from Listless.

02:07:30.787 --> 02:07:31.627
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright!

02:07:32.948 --> 02:07:36.230
[SPEAKER_23]: And now it's time to reveal the top three...

02:07:37.515 --> 02:08:06.703
[SPEAKER_23]: Games we most want to see in 2005 Number 3 Kid Icarus 2005 Number 2 Happy Bunny Kills Everything And the number 1 game we most want to see in 2005 Kill Bill The RPG I'm taking half credit for that, you know You should, you should

02:08:07.558 --> 02:08:10.019
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead.

02:08:10.059 --> 02:08:10.779
[SPEAKER_28]: There it is.

02:08:11.559 --> 02:08:13.260
[SPEAKER_28]: The definitive list.

02:08:14.280 --> 02:08:21.582
[SPEAKER_28]: As pissed off as this chat room is that I took off DDR Dimashy, and they're saying, Sky's an idiot if he can't spell Dimashy.

02:08:21.642 --> 02:08:23.502
[SPEAKER_28]: He's an idiot for taking us off the list.

02:08:23.522 --> 02:08:24.363
[SPEAKER_28]: You idiot!

02:08:25.443 --> 02:08:26.583
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, you know what?

02:08:26.823 --> 02:08:27.583
[SPEAKER_28]: I just didn't get it.

02:08:27.663 --> 02:08:27.964
[SPEAKER_28]: Sorry.

02:08:27.984 --> 02:08:31.244
[SPEAKER_24]: Katamari Dimashy 2 coming out this year, so shut up.

02:08:31.745 --> 02:08:32.405
[SPEAKER_28]: Exactly.

02:08:32.685 --> 02:08:34.645
[SPEAKER_28]: You're getting Katamari Dimashy 2, so shut up.

02:08:35.426 --> 02:08:35.766
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

02:08:39.557 --> 02:08:43.199
[SPEAKER_28]: As I promised, we're going to go over and open up the Skype line.

02:08:43.479 --> 02:08:48.321
[SPEAKER_28]: So if you want to call in on the Skype line, we will basically take your calls about just about anything.

02:08:49.041 --> 02:08:54.023
[SPEAKER_28]: www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on interact with us.

02:08:54.103 --> 02:08:55.804
[SPEAKER_28]: And look, the chat room is going off again.

02:08:55.864 --> 02:08:57.465
[SPEAKER_28]: It says, you didn't get it?

02:08:57.845 --> 02:08:59.065
[SPEAKER_16]: What's wrong with you?

02:08:59.625 --> 02:09:01.646
[SPEAKER_28]: I think they're just making fun of me.

02:09:01.686 --> 02:09:02.026
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know.

02:09:03.167 --> 02:09:03.807
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, let's see.

02:09:03.827 --> 02:09:04.688
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to take a call.

02:09:06.068 --> 02:09:07.869
[SPEAKER_28]: Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:09:09.093 --> 02:09:10.795
[SPEAKER_28]: Hello Sky, it's Elmullet again.

02:09:10.895 --> 02:09:12.817
[SPEAKER_28]: Hello Elmullet, how are you my friend?

02:09:13.397 --> 02:09:15.419
[SPEAKER_12]: I am doing good Sky, how about yourself?

02:09:15.559 --> 02:09:16.780
[SPEAKER_12]: Good, long time no talk?

02:09:17.561 --> 02:09:22.506
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, long time no listen, I just got... As with most people, it's alright.

02:09:23.987 --> 02:09:26.409
[SPEAKER_12]: I take my sabbaticals from things every now and then.

02:09:26.710 --> 02:09:27.891
[SPEAKER_28]: It's okay, it's alright.

02:09:27.931 --> 02:09:30.133
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, what's new in the Elmullet world?

02:09:32.008 --> 02:09:36.131
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, in the Elmullet world, I've recently restarted Encore Extra Stage.

02:09:36.151 --> 02:09:38.332
[SPEAKER_12]: You will be receiving your weekly plug as always.

02:09:38.573 --> 02:09:38.913
[SPEAKER_25]: Hot!

02:09:40.814 --> 02:09:44.757
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've been, I've actually gone a bit mainstream.

02:09:44.817 --> 02:09:48.980
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't stop playing Grand Theft Auto 3, I mean, San Andreas for some reason.

02:09:49.800 --> 02:09:51.161
[SPEAKER_28]: Because you like the N-word?

02:09:51.221 --> 02:09:53.703
[SPEAKER_28]: Because that's about the only reason I can see to keep playing that game.

02:09:54.403 --> 02:09:54.704
[SPEAKER_28]: No, I'm kidding.

02:09:54.724 --> 02:09:56.045
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, the N-word is funny.

02:09:56.285 --> 02:09:57.746
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't quote half the game.

02:09:58.346 --> 02:10:02.649
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, Loki, you were playing San Andreas for a while, but you stopped.

02:10:02.689 --> 02:10:03.429
[SPEAKER_28]: What happened, Loki?

02:10:04.390 --> 02:10:04.810
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, fancy.

02:10:06.151 --> 02:10:08.153
[SPEAKER_28]: Exactly, exactly.

02:10:09.533 --> 02:10:13.396
[SPEAKER_28]: No, seriously, in all seriousness, what is it about San Andreas that's drawing you to that game?

02:10:14.364 --> 02:10:15.725
[SPEAKER_12]: I really don't know what it is.

02:10:15.925 --> 02:10:19.508
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, for some reason, I like the Grand Theft Auto formula.

02:10:19.708 --> 02:10:21.510
[SPEAKER_12]: I like the basic gameplay about it.

02:10:21.930 --> 02:10:26.674
[SPEAKER_12]: And this one actually has a good story that goes along with it.

02:10:27.675 --> 02:10:29.136
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a very compelling one.

02:10:29.316 --> 02:10:33.219
[SPEAKER_12]: It relies mostly on gang warfare than mob warfare.

02:10:34.881 --> 02:10:36.302
[SPEAKER_12]: And the story is pretty well done.

02:10:37.017 --> 02:10:42.818
[SPEAKER_28]: You know what I like about the Grand Theft Auto games is the fact that you can kind of just go around anywhere and do anything.

02:10:43.178 --> 02:10:46.419
[SPEAKER_28]: You don't really have to go and follow along the story if you want.

02:10:46.539 --> 02:10:48.479
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, sure, it'll open up new areas and new stuff.

02:10:49.199 --> 02:10:55.200
[SPEAKER_28]: But hell, put in the cheat codes and you can do whatever the hell you want and you can start blowing away people with rockets and start running from the police.

02:10:55.501 --> 02:10:57.761
[SPEAKER_28]: That's my favorite part of the game is running away from the police.

02:10:58.881 --> 02:10:59.501
[SPEAKER_28]: Me personally.

02:11:01.082 --> 02:11:03.222
[SPEAKER_28]: So what did you think of the list there that we came up with?

02:11:04.344 --> 02:11:04.845
[SPEAKER_12]: I liked it.

02:11:04.865 --> 02:11:06.447
[SPEAKER_12]: I liked the list.

02:11:06.627 --> 02:11:07.808
[SPEAKER_12]: Kid Icarus made it on there.

02:11:07.968 --> 02:11:10.251
[SPEAKER_28]: Any particular game you think should have been on the list that wasn't?

02:11:12.133 --> 02:11:15.738
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't really think of any one specifically.

02:11:16.756 --> 02:11:23.398
[SPEAKER_28]: I had Beatmania 2DX USA on there because I do think that they should come out with a 2DX USA.

02:11:25.699 --> 02:11:40.123
[SPEAKER_12]: Truthfully, it looks as though an American release of a 2DX or something along those lines is a bit more realized than it would be, say, like a year ago because all of a sudden we see all these music games coming out in the U.S.,

02:11:40.683 --> 02:11:56.890
[SPEAKER_12]: With their various controllers, we have a Donkey Konga, we have Taiko, Notatsujin, and it seems as though that if these things are really taking off, it would give Konami more incentive to look into porting some of their other Bimani over here.

02:11:57.702 --> 02:11:58.262
[SPEAKER_28]: I hope so.

02:11:58.482 --> 02:11:59.723
[SPEAKER_28]: I hope it's being incentive for them.

02:11:59.763 --> 02:12:00.643
[SPEAKER_28]: I guess we'll find out.

02:12:00.723 --> 02:12:04.745
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm hoping that we're in for a treat at E3 this year, but I'm not going to hold my breath either.

02:12:05.145 --> 02:12:11.648
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm expecting to see Karaoke Revolution 4, Extreme 2, and Ultramix 3, which honestly wouldn't be a bad lineup.

02:12:11.688 --> 02:12:12.308
[SPEAKER_28]: Don't get me wrong.

02:12:12.388 --> 02:12:14.649
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, they have to do an Ultramix 3.

02:12:14.749 --> 02:12:15.129
[SPEAKER_28]: Have to.

02:12:15.350 --> 02:12:15.790
[SPEAKER_28]: No choice.

02:12:17.430 --> 02:12:18.631
[SPEAKER_28]: Ultramix 2 is the best.

02:12:18.691 --> 02:12:18.951
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you?

02:12:20.172 --> 02:12:20.892
[SPEAKER_28]: I highly agree.

02:12:21.851 --> 02:12:24.912
[SPEAKER_28]: So you were mentioning your column, which is Encore Extra Stage.

02:12:24.972 --> 02:12:28.933
[SPEAKER_28]: I will give you a chance to plug it, since you plug us so kindly in your column.

02:12:29.093 --> 02:12:30.853
[SPEAKER_28]: Let the listeners know where they can read your column.

02:12:31.733 --> 02:12:45.896
[SPEAKER_12]: Go to www.insidepulse.com or to go directly to my section, games.insidepulse.com I have a Friday column, Encore Extra Stage.

02:12:46.877 --> 02:12:48.017
[SPEAKER_12]: It's numbered and everything.

02:12:50.261 --> 02:12:51.582
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's a pretty good read.

02:12:51.722 --> 02:12:52.762
[SPEAKER_12]: Pretty good read indeed.

02:12:52.902 --> 02:12:53.823
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a mediocre read.

02:12:53.883 --> 02:12:54.403
[SPEAKER_28]: No, I'm kidding.

02:12:54.423 --> 02:12:55.103
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a very good read.

02:12:55.163 --> 02:12:57.284
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Scott.

02:12:57.584 --> 02:12:58.224
[SPEAKER_28]: Anytime.

02:12:58.284 --> 02:12:58.664
[SPEAKER_28]: Anytime.

02:12:58.904 --> 02:12:59.645
[SPEAKER_28]: It's okay.

02:13:00.065 --> 02:13:06.187
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, I guess if I'm done looking at porn, it's something I can go look at, you know, while I'm kind of coming down.

02:13:06.207 --> 02:13:07.228
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the majority of my fan base.

02:13:07.428 --> 02:13:08.608
[SPEAKER_12]: Stinky-fingered porn watchers.

02:13:11.649 --> 02:13:12.430
[SPEAKER_28]: Hey, same thing.

02:13:12.610 --> 02:13:13.150
[SPEAKER_28]: Hey, you know what?

02:13:13.170 --> 02:13:15.771
[SPEAKER_28]: We have people that listen to this show while looking at porn.

02:13:15.851 --> 02:13:16.471
[SPEAKER_28]: So, you know...

02:13:19.167 --> 02:13:34.957
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know how people could listen to this show while looking at porn, because I think listening to this show would just be... I can just see them, all of a sudden, Loki's face appearing on a girl's body.

02:13:35.838 --> 02:13:36.939
[SPEAKER_28]: What else was I going to say?

02:13:37.139 --> 02:13:39.900
[SPEAKER_28]: Over on Inside Pulse, you guys do a lot of game reviews, right?

02:13:40.141 --> 02:13:41.822
[SPEAKER_28]: Not just you, but the other folks over there, right?

02:13:42.362 --> 02:13:43.863
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, yeah.

02:13:44.063 --> 02:13:45.684
[SPEAKER_28]: Did you guys do any sort of top 2004 list?

02:13:48.002 --> 02:13:50.703
[SPEAKER_12]: We did a 2004 awards segment, actually.

02:13:50.843 --> 02:13:53.864
[SPEAKER_28]: And what was the best game of 2004?

02:13:55.244 --> 02:13:56.644
[SPEAKER_12]: Best game of 2004?

02:13:57.485 --> 02:13:58.905
[SPEAKER_12]: Give me a second, let me look it up.

02:13:59.005 --> 02:14:01.226
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been a tiny bit since I started.

02:14:04.267 --> 02:14:05.987
[SPEAKER_28]: How about you personally, while you're looking?

02:14:07.207 --> 02:14:08.028
[SPEAKER_12]: Me personally?

02:14:08.108 --> 02:14:13.809
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess it would be a tie in between Katamari Damacy and Pokemon FireRedLeafGreen.

02:14:14.449 --> 02:14:14.770
[SPEAKER_28]: Really?

02:14:14.790 --> 02:14:16.410
[SPEAKER_28]: You liked Pokemon that much, huh?

02:14:17.173 --> 02:14:20.535
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm a Pokemon fan, to be brutally honest with you.

02:14:21.336 --> 02:14:23.337
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been a fan since the Red Blue days.

02:14:23.778 --> 02:14:25.299
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a very engrossing game.

02:14:26.099 --> 02:14:31.984
[SPEAKER_12]: I love the fact that it's freeform after you go through all the main quests.

02:14:32.604 --> 02:14:36.227
[SPEAKER_28]: I thought it was good, but I don't know if I could name it Best of 2004.

02:14:37.067 --> 02:14:38.448
[SPEAKER_24]: To each their own.

02:14:38.688 --> 02:14:39.069
[SPEAKER_24]: Loki!

02:14:39.749 --> 02:14:41.010
[SPEAKER_24]: I have my nomination for Best of 2004.

02:14:41.050 --> 02:14:44.573
[SPEAKER_24]: Actually, I guess it would be kind of Best of 2005, but it started in 2004.

02:14:45.751 --> 02:14:49.213
[SPEAKER_24]: It would be Gary's Mod, version 5 for Half-Life 2.

02:14:50.914 --> 02:14:51.314
[SPEAKER_16]: Why?

02:14:52.055 --> 02:14:52.435
Why?

02:14:53.135 --> 02:14:55.977
[SPEAKER_24]: Because you can pose people and make funny pictures.

02:14:56.237 --> 02:15:02.701
[SPEAKER_24]: For instance, they have, and you can find this all at www.gary.tv slash Gary's Mod.

02:15:03.562 --> 02:15:05.122
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, the one with the baby launcher.

02:15:05.743 --> 02:15:06.743
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, exactly.

02:15:07.224 --> 02:15:11.066
[SPEAKER_24]: It says you can string up a combine soldier and fire dead babies at him.

02:15:12.072 --> 02:15:13.233
[SPEAKER_24]: And there's the dead babies.

02:15:13.573 --> 02:15:18.857
[SPEAKER_24]: And there's also one that says, position ragdolls so they look like they've had a baby.

02:15:21.659 --> 02:15:22.580
[SPEAKER_24]: It's just so much fun.

02:15:22.680 --> 02:15:24.721
[SPEAKER_24]: This is like, this is what we need.

02:15:26.002 --> 02:15:28.884
[SPEAKER_28]: Only you would vote for the game with the dead baby launcher.

02:15:29.164 --> 02:15:30.946
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd vote for a game with a dead baby launcher.

02:15:30.966 --> 02:15:31.906
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty cool.

02:15:32.207 --> 02:15:33.568
[SPEAKER_28]: Post that link in our chat if you can.

02:15:33.588 --> 02:15:34.528
[SPEAKER_28]: I can't get it.

02:15:34.648 --> 02:15:35.449
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, all right, all right.

02:15:36.334 --> 02:15:37.955
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry, Mullet, we forgot all about you.

02:15:38.095 --> 02:15:40.916
[SPEAKER_28]: And that game that you guys, you were looking at there?

02:15:42.237 --> 02:15:44.838
[SPEAKER_28]: Best of 2004, according to the Inside Pulse, folks?

02:15:44.918 --> 02:15:47.279
[SPEAKER_12]: Inside Pulse, it was Katamari Damacy.

02:15:47.719 --> 02:15:48.540
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm not surprised.

02:15:49.240 --> 02:15:51.821
[SPEAKER_12]: With GTA SA following up as runner-up.

02:15:52.381 --> 02:15:53.422
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm also not surprised.

02:15:53.762 --> 02:16:00.365
[SPEAKER_28]: Now, wait, I'm kind of surprised that Halo 2 isn't mentioned there somewhere, but you're a very anti-Halo kind of guy, if I remember right, right?

02:16:01.365 --> 02:16:04.427
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, mostly because of the fucking hype.

02:16:04.447 --> 02:16:04.667
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

02:16:05.163 --> 02:16:06.624
[SPEAKER_12]: The hype killed the game.

02:16:06.644 --> 02:16:07.044
[SPEAKER_28]: Wait, what?

02:16:07.104 --> 02:16:07.745
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't have Halo 2 yet.

02:16:07.765 --> 02:16:10.667
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't even play it, but I have a character made for it.

02:16:28.917 --> 02:16:30.018
[SPEAKER_28]: I just think it's kind of interesting.

02:16:30.459 --> 02:16:32.160
[SPEAKER_28]: What about the hype ruined the game?

02:16:32.220 --> 02:16:38.486
[SPEAKER_28]: Just the fact that, you know, it was the overnight people waiting out in line or just the... Oh, not even that.

02:16:38.526 --> 02:16:40.107
[SPEAKER_12]: We're talking about a year ago.

02:16:40.247 --> 02:16:44.651
[SPEAKER_12]: It was named best game on the Xbox without anybody playing it.

02:16:44.972 --> 02:16:45.212
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

02:16:45.932 --> 02:16:46.113
[SPEAKER_12]: You know...

02:16:47.240 --> 02:16:51.102
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll tell you what bugged me about Halo 2 was the fact... I mean, I love Halo 2.

02:16:51.402 --> 02:16:52.162
[SPEAKER_28]: It's an awesome game.

02:16:52.182 --> 02:16:53.383
[SPEAKER_28]: Me, personally, I love it.

02:16:54.063 --> 02:16:55.964
[SPEAKER_28]: I do agree the hype was a little bit much.

02:16:56.024 --> 02:16:57.545
[SPEAKER_28]: Here's my biggest problem with Halo 2.

02:16:58.225 --> 02:17:04.888
[SPEAKER_28]: It was Halo 1 with Xbox Live and a kind of better story mode, a more theatric story mode.

02:17:05.169 --> 02:17:05.529
[SPEAKER_09]: No way.

02:17:05.589 --> 02:17:07.850
[SPEAKER_09]: It had the flying things, but...

02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:09.440
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:17:28.069 --> 02:17:29.329
[SPEAKER_09]: with his Inviso armor.

02:17:29.690 --> 02:17:35.912
[SPEAKER_28]: No, I don't want the Halo fans sending me a nasty gram going, you faggot, why don't you like the Halo games?

02:17:35.932 --> 02:17:36.672
[SPEAKER_28]: What is wrong with you?

02:17:37.012 --> 02:17:38.253
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, I bought Halo.

02:17:38.453 --> 02:17:39.493
[SPEAKER_28]: I like Halo.

02:17:39.813 --> 02:17:40.233
[SPEAKER_28]: Like.

02:17:40.894 --> 02:17:41.274
[SPEAKER_28]: Like.

02:17:41.614 --> 02:17:42.614
[SPEAKER_28]: I just don't love it.

02:17:43.855 --> 02:17:51.397
[SPEAKER_09]: The Arbiter's level, though, is really aggravating because you don't know who you're trying to kill because they're all freaking Covenant guys.

02:17:52.018 --> 02:17:52.258
[SPEAKER_28]: I know.

02:17:52.438 --> 02:17:52.978
[SPEAKER_28]: It's confusing.

02:17:53.618 --> 02:17:53.878
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

02:17:54.879 --> 02:17:55.699
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I get motion sick.

02:17:57.258 --> 02:17:59.580
[SPEAKER_28]: Any other thoughts, Mullet, on gaming?

02:17:59.680 --> 02:18:01.401
[SPEAKER_28]: What's going on right now or anything in general?

02:18:01.421 --> 02:18:10.148
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, actually, going on to gaming cults and people emailing you going, you're an idiot if you don't like this, that, and the other thing.

02:18:10.548 --> 02:18:14.651
[SPEAKER_12]: I got my first In The Groove fanboy email.

02:18:14.991 --> 02:18:15.612
[SPEAKER_28]: Ooh, goody!

02:18:16.232 --> 02:18:17.674
[SPEAKER_28]: I haven't gotten any of those yet.

02:18:18.034 --> 02:18:19.975
[SPEAKER_28]: Rob at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:18:21.084 --> 02:18:22.605
[SPEAKER_28]: In the Groove is not that great.

02:18:22.865 --> 02:18:24.305
[SPEAKER_28]: Send your emails away, okay?

02:18:24.525 --> 02:18:25.065
[SPEAKER_28]: There you go.

02:18:25.265 --> 02:18:25.686
[SPEAKER_28]: I said it.

02:18:26.406 --> 02:18:32.208
[SPEAKER_12]: I personally can't comment on the game because there is no machine within a 500 mile radius of my house.

02:18:32.328 --> 02:18:32.628
[SPEAKER_28]: Yikes.

02:18:33.548 --> 02:18:40.951
[SPEAKER_12]: But the guy emails my cookie column, which I wrote five months ago, and takes it completely out of context.

02:18:41.191 --> 02:18:45.332
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh boy, you think they put in Moonlight Shadow because of your suggestion?

02:18:45.412 --> 02:18:46.473
[SPEAKER_12]: You are selfish.

02:18:46.613 --> 02:18:47.653
[SPEAKER_12]: In the Groove rocks.

02:18:50.215 --> 02:18:51.936
[SPEAKER_28]: Are you going to respond to it in your next column?

02:18:52.816 --> 02:18:57.977
[SPEAKER_12]: I've already responded it to him, and I'm going to print it up front and center in the next column, pretty much.

02:18:58.137 --> 02:18:58.957
[SPEAKER_28]: Can't wait!

02:18:59.857 --> 02:19:00.297
[SPEAKER_28]: Can't wait.

02:19:02.418 --> 02:19:03.278
[SPEAKER_28]: Silly fanboys.

02:19:03.458 --> 02:19:12.880
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, but if you do want to send fanboy or fangirl mail to Orange Lounge Radio, you can send it to either Rob at Orange Lounge Radio, Jamie at Orange Lounge Radio, or Loki at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:19:12.920 --> 02:19:15.301
[SPEAKER_28]: We all have those addresses, so have fun.

02:19:16.581 --> 02:19:16.861
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

02:19:17.502 --> 02:19:19.302
[SPEAKER_28]: Anything else you want to share, Al Mullet, before I hang up on you?

02:19:20.270 --> 02:19:21.772
[SPEAKER_12]: You can go ahead and hang up now.

02:19:21.852 --> 02:19:22.493
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

02:19:22.633 --> 02:19:23.294
[SPEAKER_28]: Have a good one, Mullen.

02:19:23.314 --> 02:19:23.814
[SPEAKER_28]: Thanks for calling.

02:19:25.832 --> 02:19:26.432
[SPEAKER_28]: I cut him off.

02:19:26.472 --> 02:19:27.132
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm so rude.

02:19:27.812 --> 02:19:28.453
[SPEAKER_28]: I didn't mean to.

02:19:28.673 --> 02:19:29.073
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry.

02:19:29.413 --> 02:19:33.494
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, we're going to keep the Skype line open if anybody else wants to call in.

02:19:33.834 --> 02:19:38.775
[SPEAKER_28]: As much as we enjoy El Mullet and talking to him on the show, I had to let him go because I wanted to see if anybody else wanted to call.

02:19:39.315 --> 02:19:41.255
[SPEAKER_28]: I've got to give other folks an opportunity here.

02:19:41.755 --> 02:19:42.575
[SPEAKER_28]: What are you looking at now?

02:19:42.615 --> 02:19:48.137
[SPEAKER_28]: You're still on this Gary's Mod thing for Half-Life 2, which, by the way, is a game I really want to play.

02:19:48.597 --> 02:19:49.257
[SPEAKER_28]: I just haven't.

02:19:49.497 --> 02:19:50.637
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know.

02:19:52.217 --> 02:19:54.718
[SPEAKER_24]: Loki, I'm working on acquiring it.

02:19:55.393 --> 02:19:56.194
[SPEAKER_24]: I have my means.

02:19:56.794 --> 02:20:09.025
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyways, the other thing that I should note that was posted, Jason, you know, in our chat room there, he posted a link to a port for Duke Nukem 3D for Windows.

02:20:09.345 --> 02:20:10.186
[SPEAKER_24]: That's pretty sweet.

02:20:11.387 --> 02:20:16.071
[SPEAKER_24]: But this Gary's Mod thing is so cool because just people, like, make the weirdest things.

02:20:16.291 --> 02:20:18.133
[SPEAKER_24]: It's like they have one with a pole dancer.

02:20:18.943 --> 02:20:39.254
[SPEAKER_24]: which is great, I don't even know why, it's just so funny, or this one, it's like, look ma, no hands, it's some guy riding a bike, then all of a sudden, it's just like, smacked into a tree, I mean, just like, funny shit, but this is the best part about it, is you can make like, your own webcomics, just doing little screen captures and putting stuff on there, it's genius, it's fun.

02:20:40.942 --> 02:20:51.608
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, it kind of reminds me of Duke Nukem 3D, when you could make your own maps, and you could just have, like, the strippers out in the middle of the street, just doing nothing, but just sitting there on the poles, and you can blow them all away with rocket launchers.

02:20:54.129 --> 02:20:57.211
[SPEAKER_24]: I've made some of the most kick-ass Duke Nukem 3D maps ever.

02:20:57.251 --> 02:21:00.493
[SPEAKER_24]: I'd spend, like, months on these maps, and then...

02:21:01.328 --> 02:21:15.080
[SPEAKER_24]: Literally, I'd run out of space, because in the build engine, which is the whole engine based around Duke Nukem 3D, you're given a limited amount of map that you can basically build in, and I would literally fill up everything.

02:21:15.280 --> 02:21:16.822
[SPEAKER_24]: Just completely fill it up.

02:21:17.302 --> 02:21:19.344
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, we're going to go back to the Skype line, because we actually got a phone call.

02:21:19.384 --> 02:21:20.805
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh wait, Jamie, you have a quick comment before we go?

02:21:21.710 --> 02:21:25.772
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just actually having a flashback to, on emulators, the Metroid level builder.

02:21:27.113 --> 02:21:29.214
[SPEAKER_09]: A guy built his own version of Metroid.

02:21:29.434 --> 02:21:31.035
[SPEAKER_28]: Metroid and the Zelda one, too?

02:21:31.235 --> 02:21:31.695
[SPEAKER_28]: Great stuff.

02:21:31.735 --> 02:21:33.176
[SPEAKER_28]: Man, people got too much free time.

02:21:33.716 --> 02:21:34.677
[SPEAKER_28]: Get out and get a job.

02:21:35.217 --> 02:21:35.698
[SPEAKER_28]: Get a real job.

02:21:35.778 --> 02:21:36.398
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

02:21:36.738 --> 02:21:38.379
[SPEAKER_28]: I gotta go to the caller, because he's hanging here.

02:21:38.419 --> 02:21:39.740
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:21:40.340 --> 02:21:41.721
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?

02:21:42.181 --> 02:21:43.362
[SPEAKER_28]: Hey, Big Red Pimp, what's up?

02:21:43.402 --> 02:21:43.922
[SPEAKER_28]: What's on your mind?

02:21:43.962 --> 02:21:45.643
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too much.

02:21:46.823 --> 02:21:47.424
[SPEAKER_28]: Any particular...

02:21:48.024 --> 02:21:52.228
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just thinking about all that first person shooter crap you guys are talking over there.

02:21:52.388 --> 02:21:54.250
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, what about the first person shooter crap?

02:21:55.391 --> 02:22:00.175
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that first person shooter players just rank up there with people who post on forums.

02:22:00.375 --> 02:22:01.657
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the scourge of the earth.

02:22:03.038 --> 02:22:07.862
[SPEAKER_28]: Now wait a minute, you mean to tell me there is not a single first person shooter game that you kind of like?

02:22:08.723 --> 02:22:11.686
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not played a first person shooter that I like since GoldenEye.

02:22:12.352 --> 02:22:13.032
[SPEAKER_28]: Since Goldeneye.

02:22:13.073 --> 02:22:15.094
[SPEAKER_28]: So at least there's one, okay?

02:22:15.114 --> 02:22:15.354
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

02:22:15.874 --> 02:22:18.516
[SPEAKER_28]: And there's not a single web forum out there you like either?

02:22:19.837 --> 02:22:20.017
[SPEAKER_28]: No.

02:22:20.938 --> 02:22:22.639
[SPEAKER_00]: After reading GameFAQs, forget it.

02:22:23.620 --> 02:22:24.800
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, well that I could go with.

02:22:25.181 --> 02:22:28.023
[SPEAKER_28]: But not even OrangeLoungeRadio.com forums?

02:22:28.383 --> 02:22:29.203
[SPEAKER_28]: You make me sad.

02:22:29.383 --> 02:22:30.744
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm not much of a forum whore.

02:22:31.065 --> 02:22:31.385
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

02:22:31.445 --> 02:22:33.246
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, what do you do on the internet then?

02:22:33.266 --> 02:22:40.611
[SPEAKER_28]: Because as far as I know, the internet's all about forum whore, live journal, and chat rooms pretending to be people you're not.

02:22:41.360 --> 02:22:42.661
[SPEAKER_00]: You're forgetting the porn junkies.

02:22:42.921 --> 02:22:43.081
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh!

02:22:44.002 --> 02:22:44.322
[SPEAKER_28]: Shit!

02:22:44.482 --> 02:22:46.363
[SPEAKER_28]: How could I forget the porn junkies?

02:22:46.504 --> 02:22:47.664
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

02:22:47.764 --> 02:22:51.647
[SPEAKER_28]: So you, instead of posting on forums, you have amassed a collection of pornography?

02:22:52.388 --> 02:22:52.628
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

02:22:53.348 --> 02:22:54.990
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.

02:22:55.110 --> 02:22:55.630
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

02:22:56.210 --> 02:22:56.410
[SPEAKER_28]: What?

02:22:56.611 --> 02:22:58.052
[SPEAKER_28]: Well then what is it you do on the internet?

02:22:59.293 --> 02:23:00.053
[SPEAKER_28]: Make fun of others.

02:23:00.533 --> 02:23:00.894
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, okay.

02:23:01.594 --> 02:23:03.876
[SPEAKER_28]: That's pretty much the same thing as what forum posters do.

02:23:04.096 --> 02:23:04.756
[SPEAKER_28]: Very similar.

02:23:05.677 --> 02:23:06.137
[SPEAKER_28]: Cousins.

02:23:06.518 --> 02:23:06.818
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know.

02:23:07.919 --> 02:23:09.880
[SPEAKER_00]: I have nothing better to do than orient anyway.

02:23:10.669 --> 02:23:10.909
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

02:23:10.929 --> 02:23:12.451
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, ranting is for live journals.

02:23:12.491 --> 02:23:16.775
[SPEAKER_28]: You should get one of those, I don't know, what, live journal or what are the other things?

02:23:16.835 --> 02:23:19.458
[SPEAKER_28]: Zongas or I don't know what the hell else there is.

02:23:19.618 --> 02:23:20.119
[SPEAKER_28]: Blogger.

02:23:21.019 --> 02:23:22.501
[SPEAKER_00]: I rant enough in my live journal.

02:23:22.901 --> 02:23:23.942
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, so you do have a live journal.

02:23:23.962 --> 02:23:24.463
[SPEAKER_28]: So there you go.

02:23:24.483 --> 02:23:25.364
[SPEAKER_28]: There's something for the Internet.

02:23:26.024 --> 02:23:26.325
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

02:23:29.428 --> 02:23:29.708
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

02:23:29.728 --> 02:23:32.631
[SPEAKER_28]: Anything else you want to share with us, BigRedPimp, before we hang up on you?

02:23:32.671 --> 02:23:33.452
[SPEAKER_28]: Anything you want to plug?

02:23:34.269 --> 02:23:40.813
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really, except for the fact that Loki, the song should not be referenced as girls because girls do not suck that badly.

02:23:40.913 --> 02:23:42.213
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to end it as that.

02:23:42.914 --> 02:23:45.935
[SPEAKER_28]: Loki is actually not in the room right now, but we'll relay the message to him.

02:23:45.955 --> 02:23:46.836
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

02:23:47.016 --> 02:23:47.336
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

02:23:47.576 --> 02:23:48.116
[SPEAKER_28]: Have a good one.

02:23:48.837 --> 02:23:49.257
[SPEAKER_28]: You too.

02:23:49.457 --> 02:23:49.777
[SPEAKER_28]: Bye.

02:23:50.738 --> 02:23:52.159
[SPEAKER_28]: Actually, I hope he heard it from the other room.

02:23:52.179 --> 02:23:52.879
[SPEAKER_28]: That would be hilarious.

02:23:53.339 --> 02:23:57.301
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, we'll keep the Skype line open for one more call, maybe, possibly.

02:23:57.341 --> 02:23:57.762
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll see.

02:23:59.302 --> 02:24:00.323
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll see what happens there.

02:24:03.890 --> 02:24:06.031
[SPEAKER_28]: Just reading our chat room, some random folks there.

02:24:06.511 --> 02:24:08.491
[SPEAKER_28]: www.orangeonline.com, click on chat.

02:24:09.072 --> 02:24:12.573
[SPEAKER_28]: Jaded2005 says, First person shooters are too much for me.

02:24:12.633 --> 02:24:14.793
[SPEAKER_28]: People play that for like 15 hours straight.

02:24:15.193 --> 02:24:17.094
[SPEAKER_28]: I have seen people that play that stuff for 15 hours straight.

02:24:17.454 --> 02:24:20.495
[SPEAKER_28]: Me personally, I can play it a little bit.

02:24:20.675 --> 02:24:24.656
[SPEAKER_28]: I like playing my friends, maybe in an hour long session on a weekend, but that's about it.

02:24:24.776 --> 02:24:25.917
[SPEAKER_28]: I can't stand much more than that.

02:24:26.297 --> 02:24:27.437
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, we're getting another call.

02:24:27.497 --> 02:24:30.838
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's go back to the Skype line and say, Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:24:32.248 --> 02:24:32.888
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, it's Misty.

02:24:33.208 --> 02:24:34.349
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi, Misty, how are you?

02:24:35.169 --> 02:24:36.010
[SPEAKER_08]: Misty, doing good.

02:24:36.850 --> 02:24:38.051
[SPEAKER_28]: What's on your mind, Misty?

02:24:39.591 --> 02:24:43.533
[SPEAKER_08]: I just really wanted to say, not all the torrents are porn.

02:24:44.213 --> 02:24:47.375
[SPEAKER_28]: I know not all the torrents out there are porn, but a good majority.

02:24:50.196 --> 02:24:52.857
[SPEAKER_28]: What kind of torrents do you like to download, then, if it's not porn?

02:24:54.398 --> 02:24:54.478
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

02:24:56.061 --> 02:24:57.983
[SPEAKER_08]: My main downloads are anime, of course.

02:24:58.563 --> 02:25:01.245
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't been much in a torrent mood right now.

02:25:02.166 --> 02:25:06.549
[SPEAKER_28]: I know, it's kind of, ever since Supernova went down, it's been kind of hard to stay on top of torrents.

02:25:07.010 --> 02:25:15.156
[SPEAKER_28]: I know that one thing I'm going to end up torrenting is probably the new season of 24, which was on tonight, and I completely forgot about it, so I'm going to have to download the first episode.

02:25:17.788 --> 02:25:19.749
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not really into 24 yet.

02:25:20.690 --> 02:25:21.510
[SPEAKER_28]: I think it's a good show.

02:25:21.871 --> 02:25:23.892
[SPEAKER_28]: I kind of missed most of last season, but I think it's a good show.

02:25:24.172 --> 02:25:25.653
[SPEAKER_28]: What kind of anime do you download?

02:25:25.913 --> 02:25:28.435
[SPEAKER_28]: What kind of anime is good stuff out there right now on Torrent?

02:25:30.076 --> 02:25:33.618
[SPEAKER_08]: Last major thing I downloaded is a series called Psychic Academy.

02:25:34.719 --> 02:25:38.181
[SPEAKER_08]: Doesn't seem likely to get released in the US from what I've seen of the series.

02:25:42.363 --> 02:25:44.905
[SPEAKER_24]: No, I just wanted to hold the microphone.

02:25:46.079 --> 02:25:48.561
[SPEAKER_28]: I thought maybe you had a question for Misty or something.

02:25:49.141 --> 02:25:51.003
[SPEAKER_28]: Anything you want to plug, Misty, while you're here on the air?

02:25:52.324 --> 02:25:54.105
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't really have anything to plug.

02:25:54.485 --> 02:25:56.026
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, well, fair enough.

02:25:56.266 --> 02:25:57.487
[SPEAKER_09]: Download the Parappa anime.

02:25:58.428 --> 02:25:58.848
[SPEAKER_28]: Is that on?

02:25:58.988 --> 02:26:01.450
[SPEAKER_09]: I found it on animesuki.com.

02:26:03.992 --> 02:26:05.293
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, download the Parappa torrent.

02:26:05.313 --> 02:26:06.293
[SPEAKER_28]: You gotta let us know what you think.

02:26:07.114 --> 02:26:07.754
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I will.

02:26:07.895 --> 02:26:08.215
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

02:26:08.435 --> 02:26:12.418
[SPEAKER_28]: Hey, video game you're most looking forward to seeing in 2005?

02:26:12.758 --> 02:26:13.178
[SPEAKER_28]: Anything?

02:26:15.160 --> 02:26:15.440
[SPEAKER_28]: Anything?

02:26:17.365 --> 02:26:20.867
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing I can really think of right now, but I haven't been paying much attention.

02:26:21.247 --> 02:26:21.747
[SPEAKER_28]: That's alright.

02:26:21.787 --> 02:26:23.528
[SPEAKER_28]: It's hard to pay attention to this show sometimes.

02:26:25.288 --> 02:26:26.129
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm just messing with you.

02:26:26.389 --> 02:26:27.429
[SPEAKER_28]: Thanks for calling in, Misty.

02:26:27.449 --> 02:26:28.350
[SPEAKER_28]: You have a wonderful week.

02:26:28.970 --> 02:26:29.330
[SPEAKER_08]: You too.

02:26:29.490 --> 02:26:30.370
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, bye-bye.

02:26:31.471 --> 02:26:32.131
[SPEAKER_28]: I like Misty.

02:26:32.151 --> 02:26:32.891
[SPEAKER_28]: She's so sweet.

02:26:33.352 --> 02:26:34.792
[SPEAKER_28]: She's always there for the show.

02:26:34.812 --> 02:26:40.615
[SPEAKER_28]: She's always there in chat to say... When newbies come in throughout the week going, Is this Orange Louse Radio's chat room?

02:26:40.895 --> 02:26:42.275
[SPEAKER_28]: Misty's always there to say something.

02:26:42.315 --> 02:26:42.635
[SPEAKER_28]: Hello.

02:26:42.936 --> 02:26:44.856
[SPEAKER_28]: If she's around, she'll say... No, you dumb shits.

02:26:44.896 --> 02:26:45.357
[SPEAKER_09]: This is DDR.

02:26:47.142 --> 02:26:48.463
[SPEAKER_28]: That's what I'm going to say in the next one.

02:26:48.503 --> 02:26:49.244
[SPEAKER_28]: No, you dumb shits.

02:26:49.264 --> 02:26:50.265
[SPEAKER_28]: This is DDR Freak.

02:26:53.287 --> 02:26:57.311
[SPEAKER_28]: Although, ironically enough, this show is going to be played on DDR Freak Radio, so for some reason, anyway.

02:26:58.031 --> 02:26:59.973
[SPEAKER_28]: It's the Bomani Sims chat room.

02:27:02.295 --> 02:27:04.417
[SPEAKER_28]: This is Bomani-style chat, actually.

02:27:05.898 --> 02:27:06.859
[SPEAKER_09]: Pimp my dance pad.

02:27:07.539 --> 02:27:10.762
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, this is Pimp My Dance Pad, exactly.

02:27:12.283 --> 02:27:12.743
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, boy.

02:27:13.044 --> 02:27:13.344
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

02:27:14.341 --> 02:27:15.701
[SPEAKER_28]: That's it for the Skype line for now.

02:27:15.741 --> 02:27:18.662
[SPEAKER_28]: We might open it up again a little bit later there, but I think three's enough for now.

02:27:18.982 --> 02:27:23.904
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to go to a break, and when we come back from this break, we've got to get ranty.

02:27:24.684 --> 02:27:26.744
[SPEAKER_28]: We're upset, and we're going to get ranty.

02:27:27.645 --> 02:27:30.465
[SPEAKER_28]: In this break, we're going to feature some superstar.

02:27:30.525 --> 02:27:31.726
[SPEAKER_28]: I wanted to hear... Oh, no, wait, no.

02:27:31.966 --> 02:27:32.846
[SPEAKER_28]: We're not going to hear superstar.

02:27:32.866 --> 02:27:37.167
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to hear Osama Kubota songs, because I promised Jamie we could hear some.

02:27:38.528 --> 02:27:38.948
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry.

02:27:38.988 --> 02:27:40.248
[SPEAKER_28]: I almost forgot there for a minute.

02:27:40.288 --> 02:27:43.449
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I will go postal if I don't hear Presto.

02:27:43.962 --> 02:27:47.324
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, we're going to queue that up so Jamie does not go postal.

02:27:48.385 --> 02:27:50.366
[SPEAKER_28]: She has so many reasons to go postal, though, honestly.

02:27:52.388 --> 02:27:55.090
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, we'll start it off with Presto, Osama Kubota music.

02:27:55.490 --> 02:28:02.795
[SPEAKER_28]: We will be back with the FUs of the week, which you can send in, by the way, right now over private message to Sky if you have something you want to say after this.

02:29:10.624 --> 02:29:11.529
Thanks for watching!

02:30:01.355 --> 02:30:02.235
Thanks for watching!

02:31:00.031 --> 02:31:00.518
Thank you.

02:32:00.610 --> 02:32:01.570
Thanks for watching!

02:32:42.828 --> 02:32:44.009
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:33:17.626 --> 02:33:18.326
and many more.

02:33:18.346 --> 02:33:18.667
Thank you.

02:33:45.382 --> 02:33:46.502
Thank you for watching!

02:34:23.789 --> 02:34:25.030
[SPEAKER_28]: Orange Lounge Radio.

02:34:25.370 --> 02:34:32.574
[SPEAKER_28]: We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

02:34:34.735 --> 02:34:35.575
[SPEAKER_28]: Son of a bitch.

02:34:35.595 --> 02:34:36.676
[SPEAKER_28]: We need to make new promos.

02:34:36.716 --> 02:34:38.997
[SPEAKER_28]: We need to put that on our list of things to do.

02:34:39.257 --> 02:34:39.897
[SPEAKER_28]: New promos.

02:34:40.758 --> 02:34:41.458
[SPEAKER_28]: Goddamn.

02:34:41.678 --> 02:34:42.599
[SPEAKER_28]: We need new promos.

02:34:42.699 --> 02:34:43.319
[SPEAKER_28]: Really badly.

02:34:44.742 --> 02:34:45.423
[SPEAKER_28]: Hey, hey, hey, hey!

02:35:13.379 --> 02:35:14.540
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's try that again.

02:35:16.481 --> 02:35:21.343
[SPEAKER_28]: Why is it that we have to do these... Rob, you are a bitch.

02:35:21.423 --> 02:35:23.284
[SPEAKER_28]: Minor technical glitch there.

02:35:24.044 --> 02:35:24.985
[SPEAKER_09]: You are a bitch.

02:35:25.525 --> 02:35:29.807
[SPEAKER_28]: I thought we could do Switcheroo Night or something, and I'd give Loki the gay song or something.

02:35:30.328 --> 02:35:30.828
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm just kidding.

02:35:30.988 --> 02:35:31.268
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

02:35:31.468 --> 02:35:32.229
[SPEAKER_28]: No, you don't get girls.

02:35:33.569 --> 02:35:33.949
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry.

02:35:33.989 --> 02:35:34.910
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's try that from the top.

02:35:35.590 --> 02:35:36.150
[SPEAKER_28]: Rewind.

02:35:36.911 --> 02:35:37.391
[SPEAKER_28]: Start over.

02:35:37.471 --> 02:35:37.931
[SPEAKER_28]: Take two.

02:35:38.592 --> 02:35:38.932
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie...

02:35:40.273 --> 02:35:43.736
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie, why is it that we have to do these FUs of the week every single week?

02:35:43.896 --> 02:35:44.396
[SPEAKER_28]: Fuck you.

02:35:47.879 --> 02:35:49.420
[SPEAKER_09]: My first FU was to go to Rob.

02:36:01.210 --> 02:36:07.015
[SPEAKER_09]: No, my first FU of the night is just to the torrential downpour we had.

02:36:08.412 --> 02:36:09.253
[SPEAKER_09]: It was pretty vicious.

02:36:09.373 --> 02:36:16.919
[SPEAKER_09]: Another F you goes to the HR guy I was dealing with for basically trying to pull the same crap he pulled on one of my other co-workers.

02:36:17.640 --> 02:36:26.607
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, whenever we brought up a legitimate concern, he was trying to pull the company this, and I basically turned it right back around on him because if there's one thing I'm good at, it's point and counterpoint.

02:36:28.369 --> 02:36:34.854
[SPEAKER_09]: So finally, I got him to say that he was going to turn over our VP to our business partner over here, so...

02:36:35.424 --> 02:36:37.406
[SPEAKER_09]: Gonna have some investigation going on.

02:36:38.566 --> 02:36:45.512
[SPEAKER_09]: FU goes to the VP for always wanting to put his goddamn hand on my shoulder whenever he talks to me.

02:36:45.572 --> 02:36:50.756
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm like, you know, I should have just said, you know, I would rather you not do that.

02:36:50.856 --> 02:36:52.677
[SPEAKER_09]: But the whole thing is that this is a VP.

02:36:53.938 --> 02:37:02.745
[SPEAKER_09]: And until I report him to HR, I don't know what's going to be used as, you know, a retaliatory action.

02:37:03.165 --> 02:37:05.167
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I think he's petty enough to do it.

02:37:05.902 --> 02:37:09.324
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um... Yeah, Big Effie goes to him.

02:37:09.424 --> 02:37:10.844
[SPEAKER_09]: He keeps begging me to stay.

02:37:11.525 --> 02:37:15.847
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, on top of this, he's trying to get me to stay there through the end of the month, forcing me to stay.

02:37:16.587 --> 02:37:20.989
[SPEAKER_09]: By some weird... We have to hold her to release her some type of bullshit.

02:37:21.729 --> 02:37:24.611
[SPEAKER_09]: And my change date's already set with HR.

02:37:24.931 --> 02:37:28.112
[SPEAKER_09]: He can't freaking do it, so I get to rub it in his face Monday.

02:37:28.132 --> 02:37:28.913
[SPEAKER_09]: That's gonna be awesome.

02:37:31.254 --> 02:37:34.035
[SPEAKER_09]: Um... Effie goes to, uh...

02:37:34.491 --> 02:37:38.374
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I really don't have much else to F you about except for maybe my lack of time.

02:37:39.075 --> 02:37:45.820
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, an F you goes toward my lack of funds and ability to travel to places that I want to go and see people I want to see.

02:37:47.301 --> 02:37:50.984
[SPEAKER_09]: Other than that, I'm fairly happy because I don't have to be there anymore after this week.

02:37:51.444 --> 02:37:54.227
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have to look at that man after this week.

02:37:54.307 --> 02:37:55.568
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be so awesome.

02:37:57.449 --> 02:37:57.709
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

02:38:01.352 --> 02:38:03.033
[SPEAKER_28]: She put the mic down, so I'm thinking she's done.

02:38:03.053 --> 02:38:03.254
[SPEAKER_28]: Done.

02:38:03.574 --> 02:38:03.794
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

02:38:04.471 --> 02:38:05.832
[SPEAKER_28]: Loki, it's your turn.

02:38:07.694 --> 02:38:12.578
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh, first off, fuck you, you stupid people.

02:38:13.399 --> 02:38:16.501
[SPEAKER_24]: You can't seem to figure out how, you know, online games work.

02:38:16.962 --> 02:38:21.025
[SPEAKER_24]: You don't go looking for a party if you're not your keyboard for hours at end.

02:38:21.846 --> 02:38:26.790
[SPEAKER_24]: And then, like, give me a tell later on, you know, saying, oh, hi, I'm ready to party.

02:38:27.010 --> 02:38:28.211
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, oh, that was half an hour ago.

02:38:28.371 --> 02:38:28.872
[SPEAKER_24]: Where were you?

02:38:29.392 --> 02:38:30.553
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, well, I was just taking a nap.

02:38:31.714 --> 02:38:32.855
[SPEAKER_24]: What the fuck are you doing?

02:38:33.286 --> 02:38:35.507
[SPEAKER_24]: Or people that do that while you're partying.

02:38:36.047 --> 02:38:37.348
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh yeah, I'm going AFK for a second.

02:38:38.068 --> 02:38:39.289
[SPEAKER_24]: And they're gone for half an hour.

02:38:40.109 --> 02:38:40.689
[SPEAKER_24]: No, fuck that.

02:38:41.630 --> 02:38:42.330
[SPEAKER_24]: That's stupid.

02:38:42.370 --> 02:38:46.332
[SPEAKER_24]: If you have things that, you know, you have to do, don't play the game.

02:38:47.412 --> 02:38:48.493
[SPEAKER_24]: Get the set-aside time.

02:38:49.934 --> 02:38:51.314
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyways, so fuck you to that.

02:38:51.594 --> 02:38:58.878
[SPEAKER_24]: Fuck you to online websites that don't really correspond with you when you order products with them.

02:38:59.038 --> 02:39:00.098
[SPEAKER_24]: You just kind of have to wait.

02:39:00.838 --> 02:39:01.159
[SPEAKER_24]: And wait.

02:39:01.799 --> 02:39:02.099
[SPEAKER_24]: And wait.

02:39:02.737 --> 02:39:05.319
[SPEAKER_24]: and hope that they sent it and didn't just take your money.

02:39:07.501 --> 02:39:14.207
[SPEAKER_24]: And, um... Yeah, that's pretty much all I have right now.

02:39:15.888 --> 02:39:16.508
[SPEAKER_24]: Yep, that's it.

02:39:17.009 --> 02:39:18.270
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't have anything else I can think of.

02:39:19.951 --> 02:39:21.793
[SPEAKER_28]: Anna, by the way, is suggesting a Warp 2.

02:39:25.596 --> 02:39:26.577
[SPEAKER_24]: What?

02:39:27.117 --> 02:39:28.338
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, yeah, we did do that.

02:39:31.926 --> 02:39:32.286
[SPEAKER_24]: My turn.

02:39:39.870 --> 02:39:42.371
[SPEAKER_28]: I would like to give a big fat F you to The Rain.

02:39:43.363 --> 02:39:46.765
[SPEAKER_28]: On Thursday night, the rain was so bad.

02:39:47.125 --> 02:39:51.607
[SPEAKER_28]: Like, we here on the West Coast, we're really big pussies when it comes to the rain, okay?

02:39:52.267 --> 02:39:53.408
[SPEAKER_28]: If it starts... God, you are.

02:39:53.608 --> 02:39:54.048
[SPEAKER_28]: Seriously.

02:39:54.588 --> 02:39:58.090
[SPEAKER_28]: Like, I've been on the East Coast and I've seen how it rains back there.

02:39:58.110 --> 02:39:59.790
[SPEAKER_28]: When it rains on the East Coast, it rains.

02:40:00.431 --> 02:40:03.432
[SPEAKER_28]: When it rains like that here, people freak out, okay?

02:40:03.452 --> 02:40:08.074
[SPEAKER_28]: But you have to remember, it's not built around here to handle rain like that.

02:40:08.154 --> 02:40:08.814
[SPEAKER_28]: It's really not.

02:40:09.075 --> 02:40:11.276
[SPEAKER_28]: It rains like that out here too long, it floods.

02:40:11.916 --> 02:40:11.996
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

02:40:12.950 --> 02:40:18.051
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate to interject on this, but Rob, you remember seeing me one of the first times I was out here for a big rain, right?

02:40:18.791 --> 02:40:19.912
[SPEAKER_28]: I believe so.

02:40:19.952 --> 02:40:22.572
[SPEAKER_09]: Were you just going, what the fuck, at everybody else?

02:40:23.613 --> 02:40:24.693
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it was nothing?

02:40:25.653 --> 02:40:26.593
[SPEAKER_28]: But here's the problem.

02:40:26.993 --> 02:40:28.914
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't have a problem with heavy rain like that.

02:40:29.234 --> 02:40:40.217
[SPEAKER_28]: I have a problem when that heavy rain starts causing so much drainage to fall from the top of the roof and it's falling outside my window on the bush that it's keeping me awake and I can't freaking sleep.

02:40:40.577 --> 02:40:41.077
[SPEAKER_28]: So I have to...

02:40:41.815 --> 02:40:43.456
[SPEAKER_28]: Get up at 4.30 in the morning.

02:40:43.516 --> 02:40:45.356
[SPEAKER_28]: No, 4 in the morning because I can't sleep.

02:40:46.337 --> 02:40:49.458
[SPEAKER_28]: And I get on the computer and read about freaking DDR and Mario.

02:40:50.839 --> 02:40:51.979
[SPEAKER_28]: I just, I don't know.

02:40:53.700 --> 02:40:54.560
[SPEAKER_28]: I was sad.

02:40:56.921 --> 02:40:58.562
[SPEAKER_28]: That's it, so I give an FU to the rain.

02:40:59.827 --> 02:41:02.629
[SPEAKER_28]: Otherwise, I really don't have a lot to be pissed off about.

02:41:03.569 --> 02:41:07.091
[SPEAKER_28]: F you to people that... F you to slow service at restaurants.

02:41:07.152 --> 02:41:09.513
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh my god, I had the slowest service the other day.

02:41:09.533 --> 02:41:10.273
[SPEAKER_28]: It made me scream.

02:41:10.974 --> 02:41:11.554
[SPEAKER_28]: I think that's it.

02:41:12.054 --> 02:41:12.795
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm good otherwise.

02:41:13.275 --> 02:41:14.496
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's hear from DDR Angel.

02:41:15.517 --> 02:41:21.860
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to being sick earlier this week because I was afraid I wasn't going to be able to come to show today, but I'm here, so yay.

02:41:23.161 --> 02:41:24.522
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to people that can't run a party.

02:41:24.702 --> 02:41:29.265
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not supposed to have somebody that's four levels higher than you.

02:41:30.049 --> 02:41:32.711
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you to Anna for stealing me away from that party.

02:41:32.991 --> 02:41:34.792
[SPEAKER_10]: Good God.

02:41:35.032 --> 02:41:36.393
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that sucked.

02:41:37.134 --> 02:41:39.655
[SPEAKER_10]: And F you to White Mage, because oh my God.

02:41:40.136 --> 02:41:41.857
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh wait, Rob helped me do that.

02:41:43.218 --> 02:41:43.938
[SPEAKER_10]: Go sub job.

02:41:44.379 --> 02:41:45.279
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh well, I'm almost done.

02:41:45.339 --> 02:41:47.421
[SPEAKER_10]: I can go back to Black Mage, so yay.

02:41:48.321 --> 02:41:49.002
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I'm done.

02:41:49.222 --> 02:41:49.882
[SPEAKER_10]: See, I'm boring.

02:41:50.963 --> 02:41:51.223
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

02:41:51.624 --> 02:41:52.444
[SPEAKER_28]: I actually thought of one.

02:41:52.484 --> 02:41:53.845
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh my God, Loki reminded me of one.

02:41:53.865 --> 02:41:54.365
[SPEAKER_28]: I gotta go back.

02:41:55.426 --> 02:41:55.986
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, go back.

02:41:56.187 --> 02:41:56.547
[SPEAKER_10]: Rewind.

02:41:59.588 --> 02:42:00.849
[SPEAKER_28]: That's the theme of tonight, is rewind.

02:42:01.129 --> 02:42:02.110
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, here it is.

02:42:03.050 --> 02:42:05.572
[SPEAKER_28]: We had a party yesterday in Final Fantasy XI.

02:42:06.393 --> 02:42:06.713
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie?

02:42:08.114 --> 02:42:13.878
[SPEAKER_28]: We had a party yesterday in Final Fantasy XI.

02:42:13.998 --> 02:42:14.878
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

02:42:14.938 --> 02:42:21.563
[SPEAKER_28]: You know how in Final Fantasy XI you have Japanese and English players playing together, that's kind of the draw, you know, it's kind of cool.

02:42:22.301 --> 02:42:23.502
[SPEAKER_28]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:42:51.764 --> 02:42:56.668
[SPEAKER_28]: OMG, JP, do they even speak American?

02:42:57.328 --> 02:42:59.990
[SPEAKER_28]: I will leave unless they understand what I'm saying.

02:43:00.431 --> 02:43:04.674
[SPEAKER_28]: I will not die because of some JP player who can't communicate with me.

02:43:06.135 --> 02:43:09.638
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, first off, bitch, it's called English, not American.

02:43:09.658 --> 02:43:10.939
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay?

02:43:11.579 --> 02:43:15.962
[SPEAKER_28]: Second off, the game was designed so that Japanese and English players can play together.

02:43:16.003 --> 02:43:18.544
[SPEAKER_28]: That's why you have something called the auto-translate function.

02:43:18.885 --> 02:43:20.366
[SPEAKER_28]: I suggest you learn how to use it.

02:43:21.502 --> 02:43:23.643
[SPEAKER_23]: Third off, you are a stupid bitch!

02:43:24.484 --> 02:43:26.265
[SPEAKER_23]: Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid bitch!

02:43:28.106 --> 02:43:28.707
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, Angel.

02:43:29.727 --> 02:43:31.048
[SPEAKER_10]: Angel's gonna laugh at this.

02:43:31.609 --> 02:43:34.070
[SPEAKER_10]: Blizzard, bio, see ya, bye!

02:43:34.090 --> 02:43:35.431
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

02:43:35.851 --> 02:43:37.833
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyway, that's it.

02:43:37.913 --> 02:43:39.193
[SPEAKER_28]: So, Sniper Kitten, F you.

02:43:39.574 --> 02:43:39.874
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

02:43:43.806 --> 02:44:12.414
[SPEAKER_28]: Jaded2005 moving on in the chatroom Jaded2005 would like to say F you to the postal service for not delivering my Dance Mania CD sooner Phoenix says I want to say F you Loki because he puts girls in the cage match which sucked and I would like to say F you to the creator of DDR with Mario Mario is dead and he just wants to add yeah Loki sucked tonight he must be a friend of yours or something whatever girls is going in next week

02:44:14.351 --> 02:44:40.474
[SPEAKER_28]: K-Dash says F you to dumb co-workers that you wish would go away Dark Knight says F you to my arm for being in so much pain after I went go-kart racing last night and F you to myself for having a nightmare of a birthday being late for work on Thursday BRP Ohio Bomani says F you to parents and grandparents that don't give the respect to their children and grandchildren that they would expect back

02:44:41.467 --> 02:44:47.239
[SPEAKER_28]: F you to Viz for holding on to Hikaru no Go anime license and not doing anything with it since they got it.

02:44:47.720 --> 02:44:50.506
[SPEAKER_28]: And F you to the ice storms that hit the east coast last week.

02:44:52.483 --> 02:44:57.786
[SPEAKER_28]: El Mullet says, F you to any mission in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas that involves aircraft of any kind.

02:44:58.206 --> 02:45:07.370
[SPEAKER_28]: The controls are way too sensitive, causing the plane to fly in weird directions when I thought I was going straight and doing barrel rolls and slightly leaning on the analog stick the wrong way.

02:45:07.731 --> 02:45:12.573
[SPEAKER_28]: Whoever was in charge of designing the plane controls must have been drunk, high, or both.

02:45:14.460 --> 02:45:18.162
[SPEAKER_28]: VXJasonXV says, F you to being so freaking tired.

02:45:18.222 --> 02:45:19.623
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, I'm freaking tired.

02:45:20.103 --> 02:45:23.466
[SPEAKER_28]: F you to my manager for being a lying, pessimistic ass.

02:45:23.966 --> 02:45:24.506
[SPEAKER_28]: Guess what?

02:45:24.546 --> 02:45:26.527
[SPEAKER_28]: It's all coming around to bite you in the ass now.

02:45:26.908 --> 02:45:28.268
[SPEAKER_28]: And someone important has proof.

02:45:29.029 --> 02:45:29.669
[SPEAKER_28]: Sounds scandalous.

02:45:30.750 --> 02:45:34.032
[SPEAKER_28]: BlackDevilerX says, F you to the idiot who wrote to El Mullet.

02:45:34.092 --> 02:45:35.253
[SPEAKER_28]: He doesn't sound very bright.

02:45:35.653 --> 02:45:39.575
[SPEAKER_28]: I hope El Mullet dishes out his cool logic against that guy in his next column.

02:45:39.915 --> 02:45:40.676
[SPEAKER_28]: He deserves it.

02:45:42.953 --> 02:45:48.437
[SPEAKER_28]: Arcadian 42, who usually is here, he says, fuck you to the cold I've had all fucking week.

02:45:48.557 --> 02:45:49.057
[SPEAKER_28]: That sucks.

02:45:50.058 --> 02:45:55.522
[SPEAKER_28]: Illusion says, F you to Sunflakes and Joe LaTaxi being so hard to find on Morpheus.

02:45:58.084 --> 02:46:00.706
[SPEAKER_28]: F you to finals coming up and F you all the goddamn rain.

02:46:02.007 --> 02:46:04.248
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie, he's looking for Joe LaTaxi.

02:46:05.869 --> 02:46:06.530
[SPEAKER_28]: Where should he look?

02:46:08.022 --> 02:46:12.803
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember where I found it, but I'll send it to you later.

02:46:12.863 --> 02:46:15.704
[SPEAKER_09]: Just shoot, I'm not even in there.

02:46:16.264 --> 02:46:16.684
[SPEAKER_09]: Email me.

02:46:17.585 --> 02:46:19.785
[SPEAKER_28]: Bat your eyelashes and look pretty at DarkSakura.

02:46:19.825 --> 02:46:20.605
[SPEAKER_28]: Maybe she'll help you out.

02:46:22.986 --> 02:46:27.507
[SPEAKER_28]: And Misty said, this isn't the best one I've ever had, but yeah, F you not having money.

02:46:27.527 --> 02:46:29.008
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, that does kind of suck.

02:46:29.748 --> 02:46:30.408
[SPEAKER_28]: And lastly...

02:46:31.198 --> 02:46:34.319
[SPEAKER_28]: Dork says, F you to no one cooking me food.

02:46:34.339 --> 02:46:36.719
[SPEAKER_28]: I need a freaking girlfriend, dammit.

02:46:37.239 --> 02:46:39.340
[SPEAKER_28]: So now instead of listening to the show, I'm cooking.

02:46:39.480 --> 02:46:40.480
[SPEAKER_28]: Boo freaking hoo.

02:46:42.940 --> 02:46:43.581
[SPEAKER_28]: I like that.

02:46:43.781 --> 02:46:46.841
[SPEAKER_28]: I like how he says, F you to no one cooking me food.

02:46:46.961 --> 02:46:48.222
[SPEAKER_28]: I need a freaking girlfriend.

02:46:49.782 --> 02:46:51.342
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, and Anna Kitty has one too.

02:46:51.362 --> 02:46:54.063
[SPEAKER_28]: F you to the lag I get while trying to listen to Orange Launch Radio.

02:46:54.423 --> 02:46:57.043
[SPEAKER_28]: Tell the boyfriend, or actually husband, right?

02:46:57.503 --> 02:46:57.964
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't remember.

02:46:58.024 --> 02:46:58.544
[SPEAKER_28]: Is it husband?

02:46:59.644 --> 02:47:00.124
[SPEAKER_28]: Fiancee?

02:47:00.894 --> 02:47:01.514
[SPEAKER_28]: I can't remember.

02:47:01.795 --> 02:47:03.636
[SPEAKER_28]: Just tell him to quit playing Final Fantasy XI.

02:47:03.796 --> 02:47:05.056
[SPEAKER_28]: Tell the other guy in your house.

02:47:06.077 --> 02:47:06.898
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll call him that.

02:47:07.378 --> 02:47:08.959
[SPEAKER_28]: Tell the guy in your house to quit playing it.

02:47:10.760 --> 02:47:11.200
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

02:47:13.401 --> 02:47:13.942
[SPEAKER_28]: There you have it.

02:47:15.623 --> 02:47:21.746
[SPEAKER_28]: Again, you can email the lovely DarkSakura by emailing jamie at orangelawnsradio.com and it will forward to her usual address.

02:47:22.567 --> 02:47:22.987
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, it will.

02:47:23.407 --> 02:47:24.588
[SPEAKER_28]: I verified it was set up this week.

02:47:26.529 --> 02:47:27.589
[SPEAKER_28]: Unless you want to give your other one.

02:47:28.110 --> 02:47:28.410
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't care.

02:47:30.607 --> 02:47:40.712
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, actually, you can either do it there or, um, this one time only I'm going to give, um, an email I can check from work.

02:47:41.773 --> 02:47:46.775
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, uh, DarkSakura at DelBiter, D-E-L-B-I-T-E-R dot com.

02:47:47.515 --> 02:47:49.036
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the only time I'm giving this one out.

02:47:49.736 --> 02:47:50.417
[SPEAKER_28]: Ooh, okay.

02:47:51.477 --> 02:47:53.218
[SPEAKER_28]: Quick, stalker fans, write that down.

02:47:54.519 --> 02:47:54.759
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

02:47:55.939 --> 02:47:58.261
[SPEAKER_28]: Anna did verify that yes, it is indeed husband.

02:47:58.301 --> 02:47:59.181
[SPEAKER_28]: My bad, my bad.

02:48:00.100 --> 02:48:00.620
[SPEAKER_28]: What can I do?

02:48:04.223 --> 02:48:05.884
[SPEAKER_28]: I like the other guy that lives in your house.

02:48:05.924 --> 02:48:07.184
[SPEAKER_28]: Come on, you have to admit, that was a good one.

02:48:08.405 --> 02:48:08.725
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

02:48:09.926 --> 02:48:16.050
[SPEAKER_28]: I got a file from DJ Ranma S, who was so kind to find this file for me.

02:48:16.490 --> 02:48:19.952
[SPEAKER_28]: Remember earlier when we were talking about DDR featuring Mario?

02:48:20.873 --> 02:48:24.035
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, here's another song that needs to be in the game.

02:48:27.993 --> 02:48:29.035
[SPEAKER_20]: Do the Mario!

02:48:29.055 --> 02:48:33.322
[SPEAKER_20]: Swing your arms from side to side, come on, it's time to go!

02:48:33.362 --> 02:48:34.424
[SPEAKER_20]: Do the Mario!

02:48:34.484 --> 02:48:38.731
[SPEAKER_20]: Take one step, and then again, let's do the Mario!

02:48:38.851 --> 02:48:39.872
[SPEAKER_20]: All together now!

02:48:44.247 --> 02:48:45.327
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the Mario!

02:48:46.948 --> 02:48:47.968
[SPEAKER_20]: Do the Mario!

02:48:48.008 --> 02:48:50.629
[SPEAKER_20]: Swing your arms from side to side.

02:48:50.689 --> 02:48:52.249
[SPEAKER_20]: Come on, it's time to go!

02:48:52.289 --> 02:48:53.350
[SPEAKER_20]: Do the Mario!

02:48:53.430 --> 02:48:55.990
[SPEAKER_20]: Take one step, and then again.

02:48:56.050 --> 02:48:58.891
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's do the Mario all together now!

02:49:00.532 --> 02:49:03.513
[SPEAKER_20]: Come on now, just like that!

02:49:05.013 --> 02:49:07.094
[SPEAKER_28]: Just like that!

02:49:07.414 --> 02:49:10.215
[SPEAKER_28]: He sounds like a cross between Cookie Monster and Cat and Lou.

02:49:10.335 --> 02:49:11.495
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh god, he was awesome.

02:49:11.880 --> 02:49:17.984
[SPEAKER_09]: And he was Cyndi Lauper's dad in the videos.

02:49:18.004 --> 02:49:18.484
[SPEAKER_28]: The 80s.

02:49:21.006 --> 02:49:21.406
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyway.

02:49:23.907 --> 02:49:28.931
[SPEAKER_28]: It's so funny looking at the chat room and some people that freaking hate that song and some people that really love it.

02:49:30.652 --> 02:49:32.233
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I like how El Mullet puts it.

02:49:32.553 --> 02:49:35.114
[SPEAKER_28]: Cookie, cookie, I'm not doing the Mario!

02:49:38.877 --> 02:49:39.317
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

02:49:40.257 --> 02:49:40.878
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to...

02:49:42.599 --> 02:49:46.202
[SPEAKER_28]: If I didn't read your FU, I didn't get one, so resend it, I guess.

02:49:46.562 --> 02:49:48.584
[SPEAKER_28]: So we'll read those when we come back.

02:49:49.945 --> 02:49:51.606
[SPEAKER_28]: In the meantime, we're going to do one more break.

02:49:51.626 --> 02:49:55.789
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to do a quick break, a couple songs, and then we're going to come back and wrap up the show.

02:49:55.949 --> 02:49:57.810
[SPEAKER_28]: That's right, it's time to wrap up the show.

02:49:58.591 --> 02:50:01.073
[SPEAKER_28]: So I thought I'd play something a little up-tempo for you guys.

02:50:01.153 --> 02:50:06.016
[SPEAKER_28]: I thought we'd play a little bit of something from Guitar Freaks, and then we'll come back and get ready to wrap up the show.

02:50:06.277 --> 02:50:06.677
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll be back.

02:51:22.434 --> 02:51:23.235
It's great, man.

02:52:53.950 --> 02:52:56.371
Listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:52:56.411 --> 02:53:00.253
Because Bongo demands it.

02:53:18.191 --> 02:53:18.671
[SPEAKER_28]: You know what?

02:53:18.711 --> 02:53:21.993
[SPEAKER_28]: I think our chat room tonight has turned into Jamie's personal hell.

02:53:22.353 --> 02:53:25.594
[SPEAKER_28]: Because, like, everybody from our Final Fantasy XI link shell is coming in.

02:53:26.755 --> 02:53:28.496
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't call it my own personal hell, you know.

02:53:28.516 --> 02:53:33.878
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't have had a problem with Final Fantasy XI had I received the support I needed.

02:53:36.019 --> 02:53:36.739
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a tough game.

02:53:37.039 --> 02:53:37.460
[SPEAKER_25]: It's tough.

02:53:37.940 --> 02:53:38.980
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not saying it was tough.

02:53:39.160 --> 02:53:42.082
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just, you know, on Ragnarok, there were always people playing.

02:53:43.802 --> 02:53:46.924
[SPEAKER_09]: I could easily go and level completely by myself.

02:53:48.294 --> 02:53:54.918
[SPEAKER_09]: But anytime I ever came on and asked for help, sorry, we're busy doing some dumbass crap.

02:53:54.958 --> 02:53:55.538
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, I tried.

02:53:55.778 --> 02:53:56.278
[SPEAKER_25]: I tried.

02:53:58.319 --> 02:53:59.120
[SPEAKER_09]: So I said forget it.

02:54:01.401 --> 02:54:01.841
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see.

02:54:02.922 --> 02:54:03.822
[SPEAKER_28]: What else was I going to say?

02:54:04.243 --> 02:54:04.643
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know.

02:54:04.703 --> 02:54:06.043
[SPEAKER_28]: I had something else I was going to say.

02:54:06.144 --> 02:54:08.045
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, I wanted to do some late FUs that came in.

02:54:10.240 --> 02:54:17.062
[SPEAKER_28]: MPQ had some FUs he was trying to send me, but MIRC sucks for some reason, so FU to MIRC, says MPQ.

02:54:17.563 --> 02:54:20.123
[SPEAKER_28]: But he says, here's the in a nutshell version of it.

02:54:20.544 --> 02:54:26.205
[SPEAKER_28]: Illusions never fixes their babani, smokers poison me, and Bill Masterman doesn't know much about how 2DX actually costs.

02:54:26.506 --> 02:54:27.426
[SPEAKER_28]: Those are all his FUs.

02:54:31.587 --> 02:54:32.888
[SPEAKER_28]: And let's see, what was last here?

02:54:33.228 --> 02:54:37.009
[SPEAKER_28]: DJ Ranma S says, I'm putting in my FU still late, I don't care.

02:54:37.309 --> 02:54:39.450
[SPEAKER_28]: FU to people returning iPods that work.

02:54:40.936 --> 02:54:43.038
[SPEAKER_28]: You retards, and F you to my computer for crashing.

02:54:45.400 --> 02:54:45.780
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

02:54:47.462 --> 02:54:47.762
[SPEAKER_28]: Wow.

02:54:48.142 --> 02:54:48.643
[SPEAKER_28]: Where'd it go?

02:54:49.203 --> 02:54:50.404
[SPEAKER_28]: We're just about done with the show here.

02:54:50.745 --> 02:54:55.189
[SPEAKER_28]: Any other Bomani news that you can think of that went on this week that I'm completely missing?

02:54:55.229 --> 02:54:56.029
[SPEAKER_28]: I can't think of anything.

02:54:56.069 --> 02:54:57.971
[SPEAKER_28]: You've been reading the boards, though, Loki.

02:54:57.991 --> 02:54:58.712
[SPEAKER_28]: Anything you can think of?

02:55:01.814 --> 02:55:01.994
[SPEAKER_28]: No.

02:55:03.396 --> 02:55:03.956
[SPEAKER_24]: Nothing really.

02:55:04.096 --> 02:55:07.079
[SPEAKER_24]: Actually, I've been paying more attention to building my computer.

02:55:07.588 --> 02:55:08.348
[SPEAKER_24]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:55:30.642 --> 02:55:33.103
[SPEAKER_24]: All the people that used to make good sim files stopped doing it.

02:55:33.183 --> 02:55:44.085
[SPEAKER_24]: It's just like, it's going to be a whole new resurgence of, you know, I guess before, I mean, it wasn't exactly, he wasn't exactly good or anything, but, you know, there was, you know, Bomani Ruler, and everyone was like, oh, I've got to get that stuff.

02:55:44.845 --> 02:55:45.506
[SPEAKER_24]: No, then he left.

02:55:45.806 --> 02:55:48.626
[SPEAKER_24]: And then it was UtterDude, and then everyone was like, oh, I've got to get his stuff.

02:55:48.886 --> 02:55:49.427
[SPEAKER_24]: Then he's gone.

02:55:49.907 --> 02:55:55.468
[SPEAKER_24]: And now there's new people stepping in to take their place, and so it's just the whole thing all over again.

02:55:56.048 --> 02:56:05.715
[SPEAKER_24]: But, um, really, I think the problem is, is because DDR Maniacs is down, and so you don't have any, like, Step Mania updates, that's where all your theme stuff was, everything.

02:56:05.815 --> 02:56:12.159
[SPEAKER_24]: So, that's probably why you're missing out on that stuff, and DDR UK is just not quite up to, you know, that stuff.

02:56:12.199 --> 02:56:17.243
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, they're working hard on those official sim files, so that'll be fun once that comes out, but, um...

02:56:18.936 --> 02:56:19.797
[SPEAKER_24]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:56:34.626 --> 02:56:43.915
[SPEAKER_24]: I've thought of some other things, but I don't want to commit to anything because I hate starting projects after I haven't finished other projects.

02:56:45.276 --> 02:56:45.677
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll see.

02:56:46.037 --> 02:56:46.377
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know.

02:56:47.458 --> 02:56:48.900
[SPEAKER_24]: No news until there is news, I guess.

02:56:51.402 --> 02:56:56.146
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm hoping the rumors are true that there's going to be some type of new DDR game this year.

02:56:56.166 --> 02:56:57.968
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, besides the Europe thing we already heard about.

02:56:58.008 --> 02:56:58.969
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, obviously there's that.

02:56:59.650 --> 02:57:01.173
[SPEAKER_24]: How about that pretty soon, actually?

02:57:01.493 --> 02:57:04.479
[SPEAKER_24]: That should be by the end of next week?

02:57:05.228 --> 02:57:09.952
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm hoping it's a sign of things to come from not only Japan, but the US as well.

02:57:10.593 --> 02:57:11.454
[SPEAKER_28]: At least something.

02:57:11.714 --> 02:57:12.675
[SPEAKER_28]: It's been too long.

02:57:12.735 --> 02:57:14.376
[SPEAKER_28]: DDR Extreme, we've been sitting on it too long.

02:57:14.396 --> 02:57:15.237
[SPEAKER_28]: We need something new.

02:57:15.877 --> 02:57:17.179
[SPEAKER_28]: We're foaming at the mouth here, people.

02:57:17.199 --> 02:57:17.939
[SPEAKER_28]: We need something new.

02:57:18.640 --> 02:57:21.142
[SPEAKER_28]: Otherwise, people are going to have to start importing machines from Europe.

02:57:21.182 --> 02:57:21.843
[SPEAKER_24]: What's with that?

02:57:22.583 --> 02:57:24.425
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, here is, I think, what the problem was before.

02:57:24.445 --> 02:57:27.428
[SPEAKER_24]: It wasn't a matter of, you know, oh, we just don't want to release another mix.

02:57:27.908 --> 02:57:32.172
[SPEAKER_24]: It was they hit the limits of their previous mix, and they had to develop something.

02:57:32.987 --> 02:57:40.130
[SPEAKER_24]: Kind of like, I'm not really sure with 9th style and 8th style if there was a lull between those, but it's like that.

02:57:40.170 --> 02:57:43.452
[SPEAKER_24]: They just have to, you know, they have to kind of redesign everything from the ground up.

02:57:43.612 --> 02:57:46.553
[SPEAKER_24]: That's why probably having gotten anything.

02:57:46.573 --> 02:57:55.437
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, since, you know, their arcade division kind of fizzled out, you know, you have to design the hardware for it, and it's a little more difficult than just throwing a PC in there.

02:57:55.698 --> 02:57:57.478
[SPEAKER_24]: So, I don't know.

02:57:57.859 --> 02:57:58.839
[SPEAKER_24]: That's the only thing I can think of.

02:58:00.305 --> 02:58:05.731
[SPEAKER_28]: DarkLionXVI sent me this link, and I thought we had talked about this on a previous show, but maybe we missed it.

02:58:05.771 --> 02:58:06.252
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't remember.

02:58:06.312 --> 02:58:07.633
[SPEAKER_28]: I think we brought it up briefly.

02:58:07.914 --> 02:58:10.717
[SPEAKER_28]: But the website has been updated here and there a little bit.

02:58:10.997 --> 02:58:14.701
[SPEAKER_28]: It's Karaoke Revolution Bamani Edition, and this is coming out in Japan.

02:58:15.102 --> 02:58:18.065
[SPEAKER_28]: And you can sing to poppin' music hits and things like that.

02:58:18.946 --> 02:58:22.207
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know if there is new stuff that they're putting in here.

02:58:22.287 --> 02:58:23.947
[SPEAKER_28]: It looks like there might be a few new songs in here.

02:58:24.327 --> 02:58:29.248
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, because I don't think like Mobomogo was in there before and KCK and songs like that.

02:58:30.628 --> 02:58:33.149
[SPEAKER_28]: Looks like some new Desro songs are going to be put in there.

02:58:33.909 --> 02:58:37.869
[SPEAKER_28]: Very interesting, these songs that they've decided to put in Karaoke Revolution Bomani.

02:58:38.770 --> 02:58:41.430
[SPEAKER_28]: One thing I noticed on the site, is that I might rave on there?

02:58:41.470 --> 02:58:42.330
[SPEAKER_28]: You've got to be kidding me.

02:58:43.350 --> 02:58:45.191
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, Loki says that would be cool though.

02:58:45.231 --> 02:58:46.231
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't think I see it on there.

02:58:47.048 --> 02:58:49.710
[SPEAKER_28]: Just a lot of poppin' music type songs are in there.

02:58:50.170 --> 02:58:50.891
[SPEAKER_28]: Not just that, though.

02:58:50.931 --> 02:58:53.733
[SPEAKER_28]: You can check out the website over at KonamiStyle.com.

02:58:54.133 --> 02:58:58.756
[SPEAKER_28]: You notice, though, that Karaoke Revolution in Japan looks a lot different.

02:58:59.236 --> 02:59:04.580
[SPEAKER_28]: It's not the whole person singing on the stage thing or anything like that.

02:59:04.700 --> 02:59:07.562
[SPEAKER_28]: It looks like basically a karaoke machine would.

02:59:08.311 --> 02:59:10.153
[SPEAKER_28]: Kind of not quite as flashy, I don't know.

02:59:10.213 --> 02:59:10.953
[SPEAKER_28]: Or maybe it is flashy.

02:59:10.973 --> 02:59:12.374
[SPEAKER_28]: I've got to see this game in motion, really.

02:59:12.414 --> 02:59:15.397
[SPEAKER_28]: But it doesn't look anything like Karaoke Revolution USA.

02:59:15.777 --> 02:59:21.182
[SPEAKER_28]: But if you like to sing, you can get on that.

02:59:21.302 --> 02:59:21.602
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know.

02:59:22.503 --> 02:59:27.107
[SPEAKER_24]: They should port over their DDR karaoke mix.

02:59:27.267 --> 02:59:37.215
[SPEAKER_24]: Another thing that came out recently, which I have to actually update on our game here, is Karaoke Revolution 3, which we have.

02:59:37.877 --> 02:59:41.259
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, cheat codes came out, so we can unlock all the songs, including Snake Eater.

02:59:42.140 --> 02:59:42.840
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright!

02:59:42.941 --> 02:59:45.402
[SPEAKER_09]: Snake Eater is the most ridiculous damn song in that game!

02:59:46.123 --> 02:59:47.984
[SPEAKER_09]: You can feast on a tree frog.

02:59:49.565 --> 02:59:50.626
[SPEAKER_09]: Best lyrics ever.

02:59:52.087 --> 02:59:55.349
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, and, um, I hate Metal Gear Solid 3, cause...

02:59:56.862 --> 03:00:03.707
[SPEAKER_24]: Us nerds were not meant to be in the jungle, therefore putting us in the jungle does not work.

03:00:04.207 --> 03:00:07.149
[SPEAKER_24]: I went into the jungle and I knew nothing of what I was doing.

03:00:07.209 --> 03:00:08.910
[SPEAKER_24]: I was like, oh my god, I'm gonna die.

03:00:08.930 --> 03:00:11.412
[SPEAKER_09]: You're supposed to feast on a tree frog.

03:00:11.692 --> 03:00:15.955
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, an alligator feasted on me, so yeah.

03:00:16.415 --> 03:00:17.256
[SPEAKER_24]: That was the end of that.

03:00:18.857 --> 03:00:20.678
[SPEAKER_24]: Because my fucking cheat codes wouldn't work.

03:00:20.718 --> 03:00:23.100
[SPEAKER_24]: I wanted to Rambo my way through it, but it wouldn't let me.

03:00:24.001 --> 03:00:24.641
[SPEAKER_24]: Those bastards.

03:00:27.580 --> 03:00:30.422
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, it's getting down towards the end of the show, guys.

03:00:30.442 --> 03:00:31.223
[SPEAKER_28]: We've got to wrap it up.

03:00:32.084 --> 03:00:32.784
[SPEAKER_28]: Final thoughts.

03:00:33.025 --> 03:00:33.985
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll start off with Angel.

03:00:34.106 --> 03:00:34.706
[SPEAKER_28]: Your final thought.

03:00:37.428 --> 03:00:39.410
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to go play Final Fantasy XI again.

03:00:39.730 --> 03:00:40.151
[SPEAKER_10]: Addict.

03:00:40.451 --> 03:00:41.191
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, wait a minute.

03:00:41.232 --> 03:00:42.493
[SPEAKER_10]: You're the one who's going to meet me tonight.

03:00:44.734 --> 03:00:45.675
[SPEAKER_24]: Final thought, Loki.

03:00:46.796 --> 03:00:48.237
[SPEAKER_24]: I hope more of my computer stuff comes in.

03:00:48.297 --> 03:00:50.059
[SPEAKER_24]: Actually, I hope all of it comes in this week.

03:00:50.643 --> 03:00:51.904
[SPEAKER_24]: DarkSakura, your final thought?

03:00:51.924 --> 03:00:52.625
[SPEAKER_24]: I freaking hate IRC.

03:00:52.645 --> 03:00:56.247
[SPEAKER_24]: And my final thought is please tune in to Orange Launch Radio's other programming throughout the week.

03:01:19.232 --> 03:01:23.436
[SPEAKER_28]: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Wednesday even, and then Friday over on DDR Freak.

03:01:23.476 --> 03:01:24.037
[SPEAKER_28]: Listen to it!

03:01:25.378 --> 03:01:25.919
[SPEAKER_28]: Or I'll cry.

03:01:27.320 --> 03:01:28.722
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, um, that's it.

03:01:29.362 --> 03:01:34.067
[SPEAKER_28]: The final word of tonight's show, one word to sum up everything.

03:01:35.589 --> 03:01:37.451
[SPEAKER_28]: Nellie, do you want, oh, you want it, Jamie?

03:01:37.791 --> 03:01:38.992
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, Jamie, what's the final word?

03:01:40.414 --> 03:01:40.654
[SPEAKER_00]: Addict.

03:01:41.844 --> 03:01:46.689
[SPEAKER_03]: That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

03:01:47.530 --> 03:01:51.734
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio Live is an Orange Lounge Radio production.

03:01:52.235 --> 03:01:59.982

03:02:00.543 --> 03:02:04.507
[SPEAKER_03]: And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

03:02:34.225 --> 03:02:35.531
Thanks for watching!

03:03:06.468 --> 03:03:07.449
Thanks for watching!

03:03:41.760 --> 03:03:43.081
Thanks for watching!

03:04:12.777 --> 03:04:13.798
Thank you for watching!

03:04:51.630 --> 03:04:55.142
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:05:15.792 --> 03:05:19.096
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright guys, we're back here, Orange Lounge Radio.

03:05:19.616 --> 03:05:35.271
[SPEAKER_28]: As a reminder, because I know a lot of you guys were off for the past couple weeks, we are phasing out the afterbirth segment of the show, just because we have other things we have to take care of after the show is now, so the afterbirths aren't going to be around a whole lot longer, and plus there will be no more post-show.

03:05:36.092 --> 03:05:40.076
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll go right back into the Bomani Music & More program featuring all your favorite DDR bands,

03:05:41.677 --> 03:05:47.882
[SPEAKER_28]: I know you guys might be sad about the loss of the afterbirth, but remember, this is how we bring you these other projects that we're doing, like the podcast and things like that.

03:05:47.902 --> 03:05:48.563
[SPEAKER_28]: So don't cry!

03:05:49.103 --> 03:05:50.264
[SPEAKER_28]: Don't cry for me, Argentina!

03:05:50.924 --> 03:05:51.205
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

03:05:52.626 --> 03:05:53.466
[SPEAKER_28]: Did you just think that?

03:05:53.947 --> 03:05:54.387
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

03:05:54.567 --> 03:05:56.629
[SPEAKER_28]: Nellie's finally saying something, even though the show's over.

03:05:57.269 --> 03:05:57.509
[SPEAKER_28]: What?

03:05:58.110 --> 03:05:58.550
[SPEAKER_28]: Exactly.

03:05:59.011 --> 03:05:59.351
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

03:06:00.612 --> 03:06:01.272
[SPEAKER_28]: So that's it.

03:06:01.793 --> 03:06:05.876
[SPEAKER_28]: We're now going to go back to Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music and
