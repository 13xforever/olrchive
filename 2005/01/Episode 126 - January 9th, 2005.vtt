05:00.080 --> 05:03.880
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

05:03.880 --> 05:06.480
Orange Lounge may contain plenty of...

05:06.480 --> 05:07.480
...muh...muh...cocky.

05:07.480 --> 05:10.360
Just kidding.

05:10.360 --> 05:13.160
Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that.

05:13.160 --> 05:14.160
In this episode...

05:14.160 --> 05:20.640

05:41.260 --> 05:44.900
We are live!

05:44.900 --> 05:52.660
This is episode number 126 for this January the 9th of 2005.

05:52.660 --> 06:00.860
You're tuned into the B money scenes.

06:00.860 --> 06:03.940
Most minty station of all things money.

06:03.940 --> 06:05.180
My name is Rob Roberts.

06:05.180 --> 06:07.500
You might know me as Sky.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.940
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts.

06:09.940 --> 06:11.860
In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm,

06:11.860 --> 06:13.660
say hello to Dark Sakura.

06:13.660 --> 06:16.380
You know her, maybe ask Jamie Sommers.

06:16.380 --> 06:18.580
I like fire.

06:18.580 --> 06:20.460
Fire is very cool. I do like fire.

06:20.460 --> 06:23.340
I watched Mr. Show today.

06:23.340 --> 06:26.980
What have you set on fire this week, Jamie? Just out of curiosity.

06:26.980 --> 06:27.740
Candles.

06:27.740 --> 06:29.540
Oh, okay. They smelled like pears.

06:29.540 --> 06:31.380
On something.

06:31.380 --> 06:33.860
I actually spent the money this week.

06:33.860 --> 06:36.980
Ooh, we're going to get into that, definitely, when we get into How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.

06:36.980 --> 06:40.780
You should light a pear on fire. I wonder what that would do.

06:40.780 --> 06:44.500
it wouldn't catch fire because of the moisture in the pear

06:44.500 --> 06:46.220
you catch the stem on fire maybe

06:46.220 --> 06:50.180
well if you threw it in the fireplace that might be like a lot of fire where

06:50.180 --> 06:52.780
the moisture wouldn't put it out

06:52.780 --> 06:59.380
but not enough, it would still...

06:59.380 --> 07:01.100
seriously

07:01.100 --> 07:03.340
i'm full of good ideas here

07:03.340 --> 07:06.260
we're going to have roasted pears with butter and cinnamon

07:06.260 --> 07:09.540
today on Iron Chef, we're a battle

07:09.540 --> 07:17.100
Also joining us, the other co-hosts, you know him, the angry, the bitter, the tech-massa,

07:17.100 --> 07:18.100
Loki!

07:18.100 --> 07:19.100
Alright.

07:19.100 --> 07:28.300
And we never say his stage name, but it's Matt Blackman, by the way, just in case you're

07:28.300 --> 07:29.300
curious.

07:29.300 --> 07:30.300
Alright.

07:30.300 --> 07:34.900
Um, also joining us tonight, we have one special guest, well actually we have two, but one

07:34.900 --> 07:37.380
of them never talks, so we just don't acknowledge her.

07:37.380 --> 07:43.900
have said stuff on this show before. Very rarely though. You need to give him the EBS,

07:43.900 --> 07:51.900
the Evil Death Stare. I got the Evil Death Stare and the finger. Isn't that lovely? Uh

07:51.900 --> 07:57.900
oh. Oh, two fingers. Oh, two fingers. You're going to hell. Yeah, I am. For a plethora

07:57.900 --> 08:03.140
of reasons which I'll discuss later. Uh, anyway, say hello to the other, uh, special guests

08:03.140 --> 08:05.140
Still a DDR Angel.

08:06.140 --> 08:07.140
Hello. Ah.

08:09.140 --> 08:11.140
I almost killed myself with the cord. Ah!

08:12.140 --> 08:16.140
Those that know her pretty well, though, know that she's actually DDR Devil.

08:17.140 --> 08:18.140
Bastard, I am not.

08:20.140 --> 08:24.140
Oh, great. There's the Devil right there in ferret form.

08:25.140 --> 08:26.140
So, do I have a name yet?

08:28.140 --> 08:30.140
Do you? I don't know. Do you have a name?

08:30.140 --> 08:31.140
I don't know.

08:31.140 --> 08:32.140
You tell me.

08:32.140 --> 08:33.140
Just Angel.

08:33.140 --> 08:35.020
Okay, it's just Angel, fine.

08:35.020 --> 08:36.020
I don't have a label anymore.

08:36.020 --> 08:37.020
Angel of the Morning.

08:37.020 --> 08:40.320
I like Angel Devilman.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.320
Or Deviled Angel.

08:41.320 --> 08:44.140
I like those, you know, paradoxes.

08:44.140 --> 08:45.140
Anyway.

08:45.140 --> 08:47.100
Alright.

08:47.100 --> 08:49.260
We got a fun show for you tonight.

08:49.260 --> 08:50.260
Actually we don't.

08:50.260 --> 08:52.740
We have a mediocre show, but it's packaged as a good show.

08:52.740 --> 08:56.260
No, it's going to be a good show as always.

08:56.260 --> 08:57.920
Lots of things to talk about.

08:57.920 --> 09:01.140
Jamie mentioned there she's actually played some Bahmani this week so we got

09:01.140 --> 09:05.600
to talk about that among other Bahmani things huge Bahmani news going on in the

09:05.600 --> 09:08.400
scene this week we got to talk about this you know this is going to be big

09:08.400 --> 09:15.320
and also we want to talk about the brand new orange lounge radio production

09:15.320 --> 09:18.920
there's a brand new show you may not have even heard of this yet we're gonna

09:18.920 --> 09:22.640
tell you guys all about it it's so cool all of that when we get back in this

09:22.640 --> 09:24.640
It's called fun with butter.

09:24.640 --> 09:27.640
That's right, it's fun with butter.

09:27.640 --> 09:34.640
And we just take DDR Angel and we just douse her in butter and then cook her.

09:34.640 --> 09:37.640
Ah shit, are you going to light me on fire?

09:37.640 --> 09:45.640
Yes. Let's have DDR Angel hold the pears and then set it on fire. We're being very random tonight.

09:45.640 --> 09:48.640
Where'd my Black Mage light you on fire?

09:48.640 --> 09:53.640
Alright, it's gonna be one of those shows, folks. One of those shows.

09:53.640 --> 09:58.640
Alright, we'll talk about all that fun stuff when we come back from this break.

09:58.640 --> 10:07.640
In this break, we're gonna feature music from 2DX, but Jamie requested that we play some 2DX songs that you don't normally hear, hear us play.

10:07.640 --> 10:10.640
So, these are under-appreciated 2DX songs.

10:10.640 --> 10:15.680
songs and we're going to start it off with a little ditty from slake called i'm for real

10:15.680 --> 10:22.680
So we'll be back after this.

10:45.680 --> 10:48.480
Reach way down into my soul

10:48.480 --> 10:51.680
And you will see real love, I'm small

10:51.680 --> 10:53.680
Oh baby, I'm for real

10:53.680 --> 10:55.680
About the way I feel

10:55.680 --> 10:57.680
I don't have no doubt

10:57.680 --> 10:59.680
Just wanna shout out loud

10:59.680 --> 11:00.680
I'm for real

11:00.680 --> 11:02.680
About the way I feel

11:02.680 --> 11:04.680
It's just a matter of time

11:04.680 --> 11:06.680
And you will be all mine

11:06.680 --> 11:18.680

Oh, baby, first you see this in my heart, and you will see the fire sparkling from the sun.

11:36.680 --> 11:39.680
And I have no doubt, just wanna shout out loud

11:39.680 --> 11:43.680

12:14.680 --> 12:15.680
Hey!

12:15.680 --> 12:16.680
Hey!

12:16.680 --> 12:17.680
Hey!

12:17.680 --> 12:18.680
Hey!

13:18.680 --> 13:20.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

15:48.680 --> 16:16.760
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

16:16.760 --> 16:22.240
them in music gaming and video games that don't suck, and some that do.

16:22.240 --> 16:24.840
Here we are on our 126th episode.

16:24.840 --> 16:29.100
I'm just kind of watching our chat room over there, www.orangelaungeradio.com.

16:29.100 --> 16:30.100
Click on chat.

16:30.100 --> 16:31.100
We've got a whole little group in there.

16:31.100 --> 16:32.280
A little chatty bunch tonight.

16:32.280 --> 16:33.280
It's very nice.

16:33.280 --> 16:36.120
Good to see some folks chatting in there.

16:36.120 --> 16:41.400
I guess the 2DX music was inspiring some talks there about 2DX clicks, and some people in

16:41.400 --> 16:44.560
there kind of felt they don't fit in with the 2DX clicks.

16:44.560 --> 16:48.240
it just me or I kind of feel what they're saying there's a lot of real

16:48.240 --> 16:52.200
like elitist 2dx players out there I mean now I've always been one that says

16:52.200 --> 16:56.040
you know just just play the damn game just have fun with a game that's why

16:56.040 --> 16:58.920
they make it for the home you can play in the privacy your own home mostly

16:58.920 --> 17:01.840
arcades don't even have the game anyway so you don't have to work be

17:01.840 --> 17:05.400
intimidated or worry about anything but what's up with that why do people get

17:05.400 --> 17:13.080
elitist over 2dx any ideas no Jamie any thoughts this because people have to

17:13.080 --> 17:16.200
to have something to feel good about themselves if they suck at everything else in life, they

17:16.200 --> 17:19.840
have to at least be good at 2DX, I don't know.

17:19.840 --> 17:23.440
I know some good 2DX players that don't suck at life, they're very good at life, and they

17:23.440 --> 17:28.240
just happen to be good at 2DX too, but some people, man, it's like, I don't know, instead

17:28.240 --> 17:33.760
of having a humongous internet penis, they feel the need to have a humongous 2DX penis.

17:33.760 --> 17:37.520
And this, you know, this could be a girl too, don't, you know. Although I actually don't

17:37.520 --> 17:42.040
know a whole lot of girls that play 2DX. I know some, and some that are quite good, like

17:42.040 --> 17:45.400
Jamie. Jamie plays 2DX. Angel plays 2DX. I am not good.

17:45.400 --> 17:50.100
But see why, now see that's the whole thing right there is that you feel like

17:50.100 --> 17:50.920
you are

17:50.920 --> 17:57.280
you're not good compared to what? Compared to other people in general?

17:57.280 --> 18:00.360
You know what, any old person walking up the street if you were to play 2DX for

18:00.360 --> 18:02.160
that person they'd probably go wow

18:02.160 --> 18:06.000
she hitting a lot of buttons. It's relative but I'm

18:06.000 --> 18:09.720
you know my skill has depreciated a bit at the game

18:09.720 --> 18:13.400
just with lack of practice. So is mine, oh my gosh.

18:13.400 --> 18:17.400
Tell you what, you know, if you don't keep practicing these music games, these

18:17.400 --> 18:20.560
rhythm beat games, you'll lose it. Boy, do you ever.

18:20.560 --> 18:26.080
It's sad. Alright, anyway, let's not get too off-topic because we've got to start

18:26.080 --> 18:27.320
off tonight's show as we start off

18:27.320 --> 18:31.320
every week's show playing a little game and that game is How Was Your Week?

18:31.320 --> 18:34.560
How Was Your Day? Dark Sakura, how was your week? How was your day?

18:34.560 --> 18:39.560
I played some 2DX. Well, then you can't beat that out of practice.

18:39.560 --> 18:46.760
Well, just a little, but, um, my week's been, it's been a really fucked up week, because

18:46.760 --> 18:51.680
this is my second to last week at my job, because I got promoted, going back to where

18:51.680 --> 18:52.680
I was before.

18:52.680 --> 18:53.680
Congratulations.

18:53.680 --> 18:54.680
Thank you.

18:54.680 --> 18:55.680
Get a nice raise out of it, too.

18:55.680 --> 18:56.680
All right, raises rock.

18:56.680 --> 18:57.680
But, um...

18:57.680 --> 19:02.280
Now you can buy more useless video game garbage you'll only play one time.

19:02.280 --> 19:04.160
This money's gonna save it for my house.

19:04.160 --> 19:05.160
Oh, that's very good.

19:05.160 --> 19:08.680
So you can have more places to keep all your useless video games.

19:08.680 --> 19:13.680
None of your stuff is useless, though, Jamie. I'm talking in general, in general.

19:13.680 --> 19:18.680
I would never make fun of the Dark Sacra Museum of Video Gaming.

19:18.680 --> 19:23.680
The museum is right, although it's all in boxes, most of the places. We're going to be getting rid of a lot of our toys soon.

19:23.680 --> 19:28.680
Are you going to put it on eBay? No, we're probably just going to give them away to some charity or something.

19:28.680 --> 19:33.680
I'm charity. Okay, do you want a bunch of Ronin Warriors and Exo Squad toys?

19:33.680 --> 19:34.680
I would never play with them.

19:34.680 --> 19:41.680
They re-released a bunch of the Madcross toys as ExoSquad toys, and we have them.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.720
We should give them away as prizes on the show.

19:43.720 --> 19:44.720
Win!

19:44.720 --> 19:45.720
Oh, I did!

19:45.720 --> 19:46.720
I did manage to get more...

19:46.720 --> 19:47.720
Win Jamie's crap.

19:47.720 --> 19:48.720
More V-Rares.

19:48.720 --> 19:49.720
Oh, cool.

19:49.720 --> 19:53.880
More copies of the EX and UltraMix V-Rares.

19:53.880 --> 20:01.520
So I have three of each, and may be doing something with those as far as prize-related

20:01.520 --> 20:02.520
things.

20:02.520 --> 20:03.520
Alright.

20:03.520 --> 20:10.560
Um, excuse me, I've also had like this burning spot at the back of my throat is just like a little rough spot

20:10.560 --> 20:14.840
So my voice has been kind of all day. I saw the grudge again

20:15.280 --> 20:19.920
How was that in a theater? Well, it would have been great except for the morons talking behind us

20:19.920 --> 20:25.040
So my friend turns around this is at the sunrise theater. She says you're gonna beat you in the head

20:26.200 --> 20:28.920
That was almost like my experience. I went and saw the grudge and there was

20:28.920 --> 20:30.920
This is right at the beginning of the movie.

20:30.920 --> 20:32.920
Oh no, this was towards the end when I saw it.

20:32.920 --> 20:36.920
And there was this guy, this jock guy sitting in the back going,

20:36.920 --> 20:38.920
EEEHHH

20:38.920 --> 20:40.920
And I turn around and go,

20:40.920 --> 20:42.920
Will the guy with the little penis in the back row please shut up?

20:42.920 --> 20:46.920
Well there was this one kid that just started belching in the last half of the movie.

20:46.920 --> 20:50.920
I'm like, wow, it must be special to be able to burp in a movie.

20:50.920 --> 20:52.920
Only retards do that.

20:52.920 --> 20:54.920
And so he stopped.

20:54.920 --> 21:01.560
just a little his mom was there too so I felt like saying making a comment about

21:01.560 --> 21:08.920
how she raised her children isn't your mother proud of you now but anyway it's

21:08.920 --> 21:14.080
just been a very weird week and like Friday was also my boss's boss who is

21:14.080 --> 21:21.560
the AVP in our department her last day and we just ended up talking about stuff

21:21.560 --> 21:27.960
in general about how last days rock about our opinion of certain people you

21:27.960 --> 21:31.640
know and just in general and I hardly touched the phone I took like 20 calls

21:31.640 --> 21:38.360
all day I ate carrot cake and I did body sculpting for the first time on Tuesday

21:38.360 --> 21:42.760
and I was so sore but I was like mom I'm gonna go spin the next day gonna be a

21:42.760 --> 21:47.400
good little workout you know work out a holic oh my god I was in such pain I

21:47.400 --> 21:52.400
I didn't go Thursday. I didn't go Friday. I didn't go yesterday. I did crap.

21:52.400 --> 21:57.400
That's like my DDR diet. I played like four days in a row and then I didn't play for five. And then I played yesterday.

21:57.400 --> 22:03.400
I played PSO last night. And on the internet. And went to TapX.

22:03.400 --> 22:06.400
I went to the new TapX on um...

22:06.400 --> 22:08.400
There's a new TapX?

22:08.400 --> 22:12.400
HAL. No, on HAL.

22:12.400 --> 22:16.400
It intersects with HAL off of Fair Oaks. Off Fair Oaks, actually.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.900
Oh, I didn't even know there was a new one.

22:17.900 --> 22:19.900
It's tucked away back there, but they have fish balls on the menu.

22:19.900 --> 22:22.900
And they have real spring rolls, like the Vietnamese style spring rolls.

22:22.900 --> 22:23.400
Yeah.

22:23.400 --> 22:24.900
With the thin wraps.

22:24.900 --> 22:28.900
For those that don't have Tap-X, what's Tap-X, for those that may not know?

22:28.900 --> 22:29.900
Tapioca Express.

22:29.900 --> 22:36.400
It's basically, you can get all kinds of tea, juices, and milk tea, coffee, with these little

22:36.400 --> 22:38.900
gooey tapioca pearls on the bottom.

22:38.900 --> 22:39.900
They're so good.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.900
And it's the gooey tapioca pearls that make all the difference.

22:41.900 --> 22:45.500
difference now now I know a lot of you guys might be all like ew tapioca because

22:45.500 --> 22:49.580
I had tapioca pudding once it was nasty nasty nothing like it nothing like it

22:49.580 --> 22:53.500
it's good it's like look online for tapioca express it's like you're

22:53.500 --> 22:58.380
drinking and then suddenly have balls in your mouth and it tastes yummy so what

22:58.380 --> 23:05.960
is it like to have balls in your mouth chewy really in fact angels got some

23:05.960 --> 23:10.180
balls sticky and squishy angels got some balls mints with her right now I'll have

23:10.180 --> 23:15.340
to put these on cam so I can put angels balls in my mouth which I think I'm

23:15.340 --> 23:20.780
gonna do right now I'm gonna look politely in the other direction hey look

23:20.780 --> 23:31.580
ferret anything else you want to share about your week your day um no fine all

23:31.580 --> 23:37.900
righty let's move on to Loki Loki how was your week how was your day Loki my

23:37.900 --> 23:45.020
week is all right. I've been buying stuff. Stuff for my project, my other project.

23:45.020 --> 23:48.300
You know, because you know all the other projects I start without finishing the

23:48.300 --> 23:51.940
other ones. But this one should be done pretty quick though, because it's a small

23:51.940 --> 23:57.940
one, so. But everything to build my micro ITX PC that's gonna be inside of an

23:57.940 --> 24:04.060
Xbox, that's gonna be for our roadshows. So I have it all. Right now most of it's

24:04.060 --> 24:10.020
stacked on that table right there. But everything else is still coming in for it. The only thing

24:10.020 --> 24:15.300
I have left to purchase on it is RAM and then, you know, any other peripherals that plug

24:15.300 --> 24:21.860
into it. And then, you know, any other miscellaneous case modding crap I want to do to it. So I

24:21.860 --> 24:28.740
have that. And then, this week I've been playing a lot of Final Fantasy and that type of stuff.

24:28.740 --> 24:34.000
Also been playing a lot of the guy game, actually, which is quite funny, because it's a fun trivia

24:34.000 --> 24:40.900
with boobies in it. And, um, let's see what else. Oh, just, um, you know, watched a few

24:40.900 --> 24:49.440
movies and that kind of thing. Overall, pretty easy week. And, um, yeah, that's all that's

24:49.440 --> 24:58.440
pretty much been going on. Just that kind of stuff.

24:58.440 --> 25:10.440
Alright, and my week and my day was, um, okay, I guess. I had a very lazy day. I've had a very lazy weekend, come to think of it. I haven't really done crap this weekend. I played a lot of Final Fantasy, that's for sure.

25:10.440 --> 25:12.440
Um, whatever.

25:14.440 --> 25:20.440
That's alright, we've sucked DDR Angel into our little addiction, and soon you will be next. Mwahahaha.

25:20.440 --> 25:25.440
Okay, I tried that little addiction. You know what? It was crap. So I stopped playing.

25:25.440 --> 25:28.440
As long as you didn't ditch us for World of Warcraft.

25:28.440 --> 25:30.440
Should we tell her about the character problem?

25:30.440 --> 25:33.440
Oops.

25:33.440 --> 25:37.440
Anyway, let's see. What else was I going to say?

25:37.440 --> 25:40.440
I don't remember. Final Fantasy XI has pretty much been my whole week.

25:40.440 --> 25:44.440
No, I went out and saw some old high school friends last night, which was good.

25:44.440 --> 25:47.440
You know, it's good to see those people that you actually liked in high school.

25:47.440 --> 25:49.440
You know, there probably wasn't many if you're like me.

25:49.440 --> 25:53.440
And I hung out with them last night. And then we went back to my friend's house and played Halo.

25:53.440 --> 25:57.620
Because I had really played Halo 2 in quite some time since I got the game

25:57.620 --> 26:02.580
It's like I got the game then I played online for like two weeks and then I got sick of dying a lot

26:02.920 --> 26:08.340
So I went back. That's the best part. Well, not when you're the one that's dying

26:09.020 --> 26:11.820
When you're killing other people, it's okay, but I was the one that kept dying

26:11.820 --> 26:15.460
So, I don't know. I just went back into Final Fantasy 11 where I don't die as much

26:16.360 --> 26:21.900
But I got to play Halo 2 last night and I forgot that it actually can be a lot of fun when you're killing your friends

26:21.900 --> 26:36.900
So, I need to, like, have a Halo 2 night or something where I set aside a night and play Halo 2 because it's much more fun to play with your friends than it is to play strangers on Xbox Live who are, like, a gazillion times better than you are and just get on there and say,

26:36.900 --> 26:46.900
I'm gonna shoot you down, faggot! I'm gonna kill you! Nigga, I'm the best one at this game!

26:46.900 --> 26:50.900
And I swear, people on Xbox Live, they talk just like that. I'm not even exaggerating.

26:50.900 --> 26:55.900
So, if you're offended by what I said, just go on Xbox Live, it's worse.

26:55.900 --> 27:03.900
Anyway, what else is going on? I don't know. I was kind of hoping to do a little bit of traveling this weekend, but that didn't happen.

27:03.900 --> 27:08.980
But next weekend is a three day weekend, so I don't know if it's going to be a drunk show

27:08.980 --> 27:11.980
Sunday night or if I'm going to go out after the show next Sunday.

27:11.980 --> 27:12.980
So that's a look forward to.

27:12.980 --> 27:14.500
I'll drink if someone can get me home.

27:14.500 --> 27:15.500
Let's see.

27:15.500 --> 27:16.500
We'll have to see what we can do.

27:16.500 --> 27:17.740
But it's a three day weekend for me next week.

27:17.740 --> 27:18.980
I'm playing hooky on Friday too.

27:18.980 --> 27:21.140
Our work celebrates Martin Luther King Day.

27:21.140 --> 27:22.140
So we get it off.

27:22.140 --> 27:23.140
It's pretty cool.

27:23.140 --> 27:26.580
Actually, speaking of that, if I can add one more thing?

27:26.580 --> 27:27.580
Sure.

27:27.580 --> 27:29.980
I'm going to the Skywalker Ranch on Friday.

27:29.980 --> 27:30.980
What for?

27:30.980 --> 27:32.980
My friend works for Lucas Arts.

27:32.980 --> 27:37.980
So I'm going to do school stuff that morning. I'm playing hooky anyway on Friday, on my last day.

27:37.980 --> 27:40.980
And we're going to the Skywalker Ranch for lunch.

27:40.980 --> 27:43.980
You should, um, take some business cards.

27:43.980 --> 27:45.980
Get me some business cards.

27:45.980 --> 27:46.980
We can find some, alright. Anyway.

27:46.980 --> 27:48.980
Sorry, I just wanted to throw that in.

27:48.980 --> 27:50.980
Whoring out Orange Lounge Radio everywhere we can.

27:50.980 --> 27:55.980
Um, I guess that's all I really have to say about my week and my day, and not a whole lot.

27:55.980 --> 28:00.980
I did see some movies, um, I saw that movie Finding Neverland, which is kind of like an artsy film that's up for Golden Globes.

28:00.980 --> 28:04.980
Very good. Very good film. If you like Johnny Depp, you'll like this movie.

28:04.980 --> 28:09.980
Alright, that's it. Enough of me, I'm boring. Angel, how was your week? How was your day?

28:09.980 --> 28:15.980
I'm even more boring, so there. Um, excuse me. Uh, let's see.

28:15.980 --> 28:22.980
Well, I guess for the gaggy part of my week, because I know you guys are all going to gag and go,

28:22.980 --> 28:33.220
not uh magus and i celebrated our two year anniversary so yay oh see he told you anyway

28:33.220 --> 28:44.260
um i also played a lot of final fantasy 11 thank you rob hey um and yes signed up for school ow

28:44.260 --> 28:51.460
that was expensive oh well not as expensive as jimmy's i'm sure but still um because she's taking

28:51.460 --> 28:54.460
I'm taking a lot more classes than I am.

28:54.460 --> 28:55.460
How many classes are you taking?

28:55.460 --> 28:56.460
Three.

28:56.460 --> 28:57.460
How many units?

28:57.460 --> 28:58.460
Three.

28:58.460 --> 28:59.460
Because there are only one unit classes each.

28:59.460 --> 29:00.460
Oh.

29:00.460 --> 29:01.460
Okay.

29:01.460 --> 29:02.460
I'm taking four three-unit classes.

29:02.460 --> 29:03.460
Ow.

29:03.460 --> 29:04.460
See?

29:04.460 --> 29:05.460
Well, no one's a two.

29:05.460 --> 29:06.460
Well, yeah, it's not my fault.

29:06.460 --> 29:07.460
So I'm going 11 units.

29:07.460 --> 29:08.460
It's not my fault.

29:08.460 --> 29:09.460
I'm working full-time.

29:09.460 --> 29:10.460
Yeah.

29:10.460 --> 29:11.460
I got that, too.

29:11.460 --> 29:12.460
So.

29:12.460 --> 29:13.460
Hm?

29:13.460 --> 29:14.460
I got that, too.

29:14.460 --> 29:15.460
Yeah.

29:15.460 --> 29:19.460
Well, I've got work, too, and all that stuff.

29:19.460 --> 29:27.260
Other than that, I didn't really do much this week, so I'm more boring than Rob is.

29:27.260 --> 29:28.580
As if that's possible.

29:28.580 --> 29:34.140
Oh, I forgot to say, one other thing I did is that I went to the book store, Borders

29:34.140 --> 29:36.980
Books, and I got a book about starting your own business.

29:36.980 --> 29:37.980
You can read?

29:37.980 --> 29:39.980
Amazingly enough, I can.

29:39.980 --> 29:44.620
I thought that if you were like, you know, a corporate trainer, you couldn't read and

29:44.620 --> 29:45.620
had bad grammar.

29:45.620 --> 29:46.620
Very funny.

29:46.620 --> 29:49.300
Very funny.

29:49.300 --> 29:53.420
You know, well I have horrible handwriting so whenever I write on the board, for those

29:53.420 --> 29:56.980
that don't know my day job is I'm a corporate trainer, and when I write on the board it's

29:56.980 --> 29:57.980
very yucky.

29:57.980 --> 29:59.820
That's why I like to use PowerPoint.

29:59.820 --> 30:05.180
It was very much a tease because I have known some where I work who have the worst grammar

30:05.180 --> 30:06.180
ever.

30:06.180 --> 30:08.140
I am the best corporate trainer you'll ever have.

30:08.140 --> 30:10.140
You are the best.

30:10.140 --> 30:11.140
You should come work where I work.

30:11.140 --> 30:12.140
Well, not really.

30:12.140 --> 30:17.340
If you give me a job making what I'm going to be making in my new position, sure.

30:17.340 --> 30:20.580
Everybody should come work where I work, except I'm not going to tell you where I work because

30:20.580 --> 30:22.460
I don't need any more stalkers.

30:22.460 --> 30:28.860
Anyway, oh yeah, so I got the book on starting your own business so that, you know, because

30:28.860 --> 30:32.420
we're thinking about with Orange Lounge Radio, we're thinking about it, we're thinking about

30:32.420 --> 30:35.380
it, actually making this legit.

30:35.380 --> 30:37.100
We've been doing it for what, two and a half years now?

30:37.100 --> 30:39.620
I think it's about time to make this legit.

30:39.620 --> 30:48.660
always been in the business sex you up on that note I think we're gonna go to a

30:48.660 --> 30:53.580
break and when we come back from this break I know we got a list list we want

30:53.580 --> 30:57.780
to do tonight I know we've got something that new project we want to plug for

30:57.780 --> 31:00.820
those that haven't figured it out we got a cage match we want to do we got big

31:00.820 --> 31:05.300
DDR news very full plate for us when we come back in this break I thought we

31:05.300 --> 31:10.340
do some poppy DDR music like some DDR poppy music starting it off with one of

31:10.340 --> 31:14.260
the most poppy songs of all Dark Knight wanted to dedicate this to his friend

31:14.260 --> 31:19.260
who's having a rough week so I'm gonna do that for him because we here at

31:19.260 --> 31:26.260
Orange Lawns Radio. We care. We care. We'll be back after this with more Orange Lawns Radio.

31:49.260 --> 32:01.260
I need your love in every way And I feel this every day

32:01.260 --> 32:06.260
Cause I have too many tears To fall in love again

32:06.260 --> 32:10.260
Now I am walking around In this side of the town

32:10.260 --> 32:15.260
I just can't hide away How can I look in your eyes

32:45.260 --> 33:01.220
I made a My Bad there, that was actually for DJ Rama S's friend, not Dark Knight's friend,

33:01.220 --> 33:04.460
although maybe Dark Knight wanted to hear it too, I have no idea, but as you can tell,

33:04.460 --> 33:07.860
I usually get too many private messages during the show, so I screwed up.

33:07.860 --> 33:08.360
My bad

33:37.860 --> 33:40.860
Baby, stay with me tonight

33:40.860 --> 33:42.860

Oh, yeah

Let me find out

33:55.860 --> 33:56.860
Watch your glasses last

33:56.860 --> 33:57.860
Make a passion dance

33:57.860 --> 33:58.860
Your body jam

33:58.860 --> 33:59.860
Felt so cute

33:59.860 --> 34:00.860
Come on, now I've got my mind

34:00.860 --> 34:01.860
To do what I said to you

34:01.860 --> 34:02.860
So tonight

34:02.860 --> 34:03.860
Move your body to the bright

34:03.860 --> 34:04.860
Imagine

34:04.860 --> 34:05.860
Up there on your chest

34:05.860 --> 34:06.860
On your lower

34:06.860 --> 34:08.860
You know I'm not so bad

34:08.860 --> 34:11.860
That's my bad and I'm united

34:11.860 --> 34:14.860
And the rest is dependent on you

34:14.860 --> 34:18.860
Come close to me and we'll be united

34:18.860 --> 34:21.860
You will see, it's all so true

34:21.860 --> 34:24.860
That's my bad and I'm not faking

34:24.860 --> 34:27.860
Don't take less when you can't get it all

34:27.860 --> 34:31.860
Just hold me tight, what you're giving I'm taking

34:31.860 --> 34:36.860
Baby, stay with me tonight, alright

36:31.860 --> 36:42.260
Carried away by a moonlight, shed a chance to look in the riddle of a Saturday night

36:42.260 --> 36:48.860
Far away on the other side, she was caught in the middle of a different flight

36:48.860 --> 36:51.860
And she couldn't find how to push through

36:51.860 --> 36:55.860
A dream that was full in the evening

36:55.860 --> 36:59.860
Carried away by a moonlight, shed a chance to look

36:59.860 --> 37:05.860
Sore and breathing, carried away by a moonlight shadow

37:05.860 --> 37:12.860
She saw what the feeling went and found, far away on the other side

37:12.860 --> 37:19.860
She was shot six times by a man who ran, and she couldn't find how to push through

37:19.860 --> 37:26.860
I said, I said, I prayed, I need you in heaven, one day

37:26.860 --> 37:53.740
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

37:53.740 --> 37:58.020
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

37:58.020 --> 38:03.220
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

38:03.220 --> 38:08.980
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 126.

38:08.980 --> 38:09.540
Yeah, I know.

38:09.540 --> 38:11.860
I can't believe we've been doing it that long either.

38:11.860 --> 38:15.540
Anyway, we have been doing this quite a while,

38:15.540 --> 38:18.660
but there's always new stuff cooking up over at Orange Lounge Radio.

38:18.660 --> 38:21.140
And we have a brand new thing.

38:21.140 --> 38:23.220
It just launched earlier this week, but we

38:23.220 --> 38:26.220
know a lot of you guys don't really pay attention to anything we do outside of

38:26.220 --> 38:30.020
this Sunday show so we want to let you guys know there's actually a brand new

38:30.020 --> 38:35.500
show and one of the most common requests we get here on Orange Lounge Radio is

38:35.500 --> 38:42.140
can we download your show and we to that we say no you can't it's too the files

38:42.140 --> 38:46.380
are too big how does it feel to want yeah basically a the files are too big

38:46.380 --> 38:50.020
be you know we want people to listen live and a horse of our ratings and see

38:50.020 --> 38:53.580
you can always catch the rewinds on DDR for your radio Fridays at 6. Whatever. So,

38:53.580 --> 38:57.100
that, you know, it's just not happening right now anyway. I can't say it's never

38:57.100 --> 39:01.500
gonna happen, but just right at this time it's not happening. But, we decided, we

39:01.500 --> 39:04.820
thought, well, let's give them something they can download. And there's this new

39:04.820 --> 39:08.660
technology out there called podcasting. For those of you guys that haven't heard

39:08.660 --> 39:13.900
about this, you got to check out a site such as iPoder.org. That's not Potter as

39:13.900 --> 39:22.300
and Harry Potter, that's podder, p-o-d-d-e-r, ipodder.org, what else, what about podcasting.net,

39:22.300 --> 39:25.900
what are the other big sites, I can't even think of them, there's so many, podcastally.com,

39:25.900 --> 39:32.040
I think is another one. Do you have to have an iPod to hear this show? No. Do you have

39:32.040 --> 39:36.020
to have a live 365 account or do you have to listen to the station live to hear this

39:36.020 --> 39:40.140
show? No. It's something you download onto your computer. Do you have to have broadband

39:40.140 --> 39:43.960
to hear the show, no, it's just going to be a little slower for you. So check out

39:43.960 --> 39:47.760
on our website, there's a new feature over on the left side, it's called Orange

39:47.760 --> 39:53.880
Lounge Radio To Go, and it's basically a brand new, I don't know, 15 to 25 minute

39:53.880 --> 39:57.700
show. It's a mini show, but it's something that's intended for you to

39:57.700 --> 40:01.160
download every week, and for those of you guys that do have some type of portable

40:01.160 --> 40:06.520
media player, such as an iPod, the whole reason it's called podcasting is because

40:06.520 --> 40:12.240
iPod is the most popular form of this. But if you have any portable media player, really,

40:12.240 --> 40:16.420
what this is designed to do is that you can subscribe to the Orange Launch Radio Podcast

40:16.420 --> 40:21.580
and then just keep checking it. Have your iPod or program check every week or so or

40:21.580 --> 40:27.120
check every day. And every Monday or so, you're gonna see a new show from us. And if you have

40:27.120 --> 40:31.280
a media player, it'll hook right up to your media player so that you'll have a new show

40:31.280 --> 40:35.720
to listen to for that week. So it's pretty cool. You gotta check it out. There's already

40:35.720 --> 40:39.560
an episode up there for grabs if you want to subscribe. I know a few of you guys have

40:39.560 --> 40:43.280
been having problems getting the most recent episode. We're hoping that when we put up

40:43.280 --> 40:48.540
a new episode, it's going to fix all that, so just stay tuned. Go ahead, subscribe to

40:48.540 --> 40:53.740
it and keep checking. There should be a new episode up tomorrow, if not late, late tonight

40:53.740 --> 40:58.580
possibly, but there is one already there. We taped a show last week and it got put up

40:58.580 --> 41:02.700
there and a lot of folks have already been downloading it. In fact, I think we might

41:02.700 --> 41:07.020
have some new folks listening to this show who actually heard the podcast

41:07.020 --> 41:11.140
first because the podcast is such a huge new technology that's out there a lot of

41:11.140 --> 41:14.900
people are just downloading new shows as they can find it and if you came all

41:14.900 --> 41:18.900
this way to listen to our live show hey thanks a bunch stop on in the chat room

41:18.900 --> 41:24.060
and let us know you enjoyed it www.orangelandtrader.com click on chat

41:24.060 --> 41:29.900
and yes it is a show we plan to do every week if not more we might actually I

41:29.900 --> 41:35.340
I mean, when we go on the road, such as, oh, I don't know, E3, we might be able to use

41:35.340 --> 41:40.940
this technology to do updates every day, little shows, little interviews from E3, so stay

41:40.940 --> 41:41.940
tuned.

41:41.940 --> 41:42.940
It's very cool.

41:42.940 --> 41:43.940
It'll also have the infernal machine.

41:43.940 --> 41:44.940
Mm-hmm.

41:44.940 --> 41:52.140
So, yeah, that, so, wow, lots of stuff there.

41:52.140 --> 41:53.620
The podcast is an exciting feature.

41:53.620 --> 41:58.540
Remember, all you gotta do is subscribe, and you're set.

41:58.540 --> 42:02.700
Now of course all the chat room is saying the next step is Orange Lounge Radio Television

42:02.700 --> 42:07.400
and I want my OLR TV, which is kind of funny, because when you think about it, I don't know

42:07.400 --> 42:11.220
if you knew this, but do you know who one of the driving forces behind podcasting was?

42:11.220 --> 42:14.380
One of the people that kind of came up with the idea with some friends?

42:14.380 --> 42:18.140
Adam Curry, the MTV VJ from years ago.

42:18.140 --> 42:19.360
Dude, he was cool.

42:19.360 --> 42:20.360
He was awesome.

42:20.360 --> 42:27.140
And now he's got this thing, which just makes him even more cool, so, you know, it's awesome.

42:27.140 --> 42:31.420
know it would be like ultimately cool if like it were also sponsored by Martha

42:31.420 --> 42:38.300
Quinn then I would be happy. And instead of being hosted by us we'll just have

42:38.300 --> 42:42.780
Julie Brown and what we need what we need to do something when we have our TV

42:42.780 --> 42:47.460
show we need like the remote control segment complete with those chairs

42:47.460 --> 42:52.100
seriously remote control that could be like our game shows at the match game

42:52.100 --> 42:54.820
segment or something. If you get the answer wrong.

42:54.820 --> 42:59.620
Nah nah nah nah. Nah nah nah nah. God, I remember when MTV was cool.

42:59.620 --> 43:03.300
I know, now they suck on ice. But the weird thing is, like, how old were

43:03.300 --> 43:07.340
we when MTV was cool? Like, maybe 12? Around that age?

43:07.340 --> 43:12.900
I think the time when MTV was cool was when I was a senior in high school, so I was 18.

43:12.900 --> 43:17.080
Was probably when these guys like Adam Curry and Martha Quinn and them were still on the

43:17.080 --> 43:21.740
air, if we're showing our age a little bit. It was right when, you know, the real world

43:21.740 --> 43:26.540
was cool when it first came out, it was kind of a neat concept. When it took over the entirety

43:26.540 --> 43:32.900
of MTV, uh-uh. You know, I took watch of my remote control, but the thing is that my senior

43:32.900 --> 43:38.420
year of high school was spent on two pots of coffee every night watching the good cast

43:38.420 --> 43:42.780
of Saturday Night Live. You know, back when Mike Myers and Dana Carvey and all them were

43:42.780 --> 43:43.780
on...

43:43.780 --> 43:47.580
Now, some would argue with you that this old 75 cast with Bill Murray and Gilda Radner...

43:47.580 --> 43:51.260
Well, they were great too, but I mean like as far as the more modern era of Saturday

43:51.260 --> 43:56.780
live and then I would probably turn on 120 minutes and have bangers ball my

43:56.780 --> 44:00.340
god look at this our chat room right now you got to see this over in orange

44:00.340 --> 44:03.300
launch radio.com click on chat they're practically creating this whole

44:03.300 --> 44:07.540
treatment for an orange launch radio TV show that could be on MTV they're saying

44:07.540 --> 44:13.220
all the cage match could have videos on it people could vote and it's crazy

44:13.220 --> 44:17.500
that's awesome you guys rock I don't know I don't know what to tell you guys

44:17.500 --> 44:26.500
Guys, I'd love to see it happen some day, but at the same time, gotta pay the rent, so I can't quit my J-Dog yet until somebody says,

44:26.500 --> 44:32.500
Here, Rob, here's some money. Come to a show. Then I'd be all, Fuck yeah, I quit. We'll see. And I'm sure you're the same, right?

44:32.500 --> 44:38.500
What was the line from Wayne's World? Get paid to do Wayne's World?

44:38.500 --> 44:46.180
Yeah. That's like my dream right there is Wayne's World the movie, except don't they

44:46.180 --> 44:53.180
get kind of screwed in the end? Oh well. Who cares? We'll see, maybe someday. But I think

44:53.180 --> 44:57.420
the podcast is a really exciting technology because it allows people like Adam Curry to

44:57.420 --> 45:07.820
hear us. Anyway, we'll see what happens. Alright, anyway, so there's the podcast. Again, I urge

45:07.820 --> 45:11.240
you guys to check this out on the website over at orangehonoredradio.com. Just look

45:11.240 --> 45:15.400
in the upper left, it says Orange Honored Radio to go. It's really easy to set up.

45:15.400 --> 45:18.780
Honestly, if you were able to listen to this show, if you were able to sign up for Live

45:18.780 --> 45:24.380
365 and get this show to play, you can do this podcast thing. It's super easy. And again,

45:24.380 --> 45:28.380
you don't have to have a portable player. You can just have it download the MP3 and

45:28.380 --> 45:32.500
you'll listen to it in Winamp or iTunes or whatever later. And just an FYI, for those

45:32.500 --> 45:39.100
you guys that do listen to this. That show is actually encoded in MP3 Pro, which doesn't

45:39.100 --> 45:42.660
do you any good if you have an iPod, because iPods don't decode it, but if you're using

45:42.660 --> 45:47.380
Winamp, you can actually listen to that show in MP3 Pro, and it sounds great. So, just

45:47.380 --> 45:53.380
a thought. All right. Anyway, on to some actual gaming news. Let's talk gaming news that's

45:53.380 --> 46:02.220
going on right now. Huge, no, this is huge. This is really huge. All right. In the DDR

46:02.220 --> 46:08.300
this week, there was huge news. What has been one thing that people in the DDR scene have

46:08.300 --> 46:16.740
been begging for for the longest time, other than to get laid? A 62 foot long cigar? No,

46:16.740 --> 46:26.520
not a 62 foot long cigar. What else? They want more Mamba like Go-Go. They want a DDR

46:26.520 --> 46:31.220
game featuring characters from other games that have nothing to do with DDR whatsoever.

46:31.220 --> 46:35.300
That's absolutely right. No, actually, I'll tell you, since you obviously don't know.

46:35.300 --> 46:38.860
They want a DDR game on the GameCube.

46:38.860 --> 46:44.340
Because GameCube doesn't have a DDR game. There was one on the Nintendo 64. Well, not the GameCube.

46:44.340 --> 46:49.780
So, GameCube, announced this week, is getting its own DDR game.

46:49.780 --> 46:53.180
Does this fulfill my fantasy for having to buy yet another peripheral for

46:53.180 --> 46:55.020
another game system to play DDR?

46:55.020 --> 46:58.460
You can never have too many specialty controllers, dammit. It absolutely does.

46:58.460 --> 47:09.460
And if you think about it, Nintendo is really the granddaddy of DDR, the granddaddy, granddaddy, granddaddy, like the great, great granddaddy of DDR is Dance Aerobics, if you think about it, with the power pad.

47:09.460 --> 47:15.960
So, um, it makes sense that, uh, it's going back to its roots, and DDR is going to be showing up on the GameCube.

47:15.960 --> 47:22.960
Details are very sketchy at this time, this is what we know. It's DDR featuring Mario.

47:22.960 --> 47:28.960
We can, uh, urge to refer to old cartoon rising.

47:28.960 --> 47:30.960
I know, I know, seriously.

47:30.960 --> 47:34.960
Absolutely the first thing I thought of when I heard this, I read this story and it was very...

47:34.960 --> 47:41.960
Earlier this week the rain was keeping me up at like 4 in the morning, and I ended up getting online and I read about this.

47:41.960 --> 47:51.960
And just instantly, I couldn't help but when I read that DDR and Mario were teaming up to do this, I couldn't help but think about this.

47:51.960 --> 47:56.960
Hey, Paisanos! It's the Super Mario Brothers Super Show!

47:56.960 --> 48:23.960
Thank you, late 80s, early 90s.

48:23.960 --> 48:29.960
Koopas and Koopas, the princess and the others, hanging with the plumbers, you'll be hooked on the brothers and the friends!

48:47.960 --> 48:49.960
I said hook, hook, hook, hook, hook!

48:49.960 --> 48:51.960
Don't the brothers, the brothers, the brothers!

48:51.960 --> 48:53.960
Oh, you gotta love that echo at the end.

48:53.960 --> 48:56.960
Hooked on the brothers, brothers, brothers.

48:56.960 --> 49:00.960
I am petitioning Nintendo myself to have that song included.

49:00.960 --> 49:04.960
It needs to be there. It absolutely needs to be there in DDR Mario.

49:04.960 --> 49:06.960
Or the one with Lou Albano singing it at the end.

49:06.960 --> 49:10.960
Let's all do some Mario. Remember that one?

49:10.960 --> 49:13.960
I wish we had an MP3 that we could play too, but...

49:13.960 --> 49:18.960
So, here it is. Nintendo is going to be doing this DDR game, but Konami...

49:18.960 --> 49:25.960
It's some kind of partnership, and we don't really know in what capacity if Nintendo is making the game with Konami's blessing, or what's going on.

49:25.960 --> 49:35.960
I have a feeling it's going to be very similar to Donkey Konga, because when you look at Donkey Konga, it's basically Taiko Drum Master, but with Donkey Konga.

49:35.960 --> 49:37.960
Stupid clapping!

49:37.960 --> 49:45.960
But it had Namco's blessing. Namco actually helped them out with the game, so I think it's going to be very similar to that. That's just speculation, we'll see. Loki?

49:45.960 --> 49:48.960
There's one thing for sure, it's gonna have awesome minigames.

49:48.960 --> 49:52.960
Because if there's one thing that Nintendo's good at, it's making minigames for games.

49:52.960 --> 50:01.960
So, that would be a lot better than that crappy, what, feed the oddly shaped animal heads or whatever, you know?

50:01.960 --> 50:06.960
Or the, or the frustrating hit the ball around the maze thing.

50:06.960 --> 50:09.960
That's a lot better than that. So, um...

50:09.960 --> 50:18.040
I just can't, no, I can't buy this game.

50:18.040 --> 50:20.860
It's alright, because I'm definitely going to buy it, I have to buy this game.

50:20.860 --> 50:25.840
If you actually look at our website, orangeontrader.com, we actually posted a story about this earlier

50:25.840 --> 50:30.240
this week, it's like the second story down, it says, DDR teaming up with Mario, and if

50:30.240 --> 50:34.520
you actually click on the read more, you can see some screenshots from the game.

50:34.520 --> 50:39.640
And the first two screenshots look like your standard DDR setup, although the two player

50:39.640 --> 50:43.800
mode is interesting. It looks like some of the dancing characters you can have, you have

50:43.800 --> 50:47.660
a little Mario and then it looks like a little, either that's a hammer brother or it's a Koopa

50:47.660 --> 50:51.100
Troopa. I can't really tell because it's from the Skyview. I think it's a hammer brother

50:51.100 --> 50:54.340
because I see a hammer in the picture. So it looks like those are some of the maybe

50:54.340 --> 50:59.480
dancing characters that might be available, who knows? But then the third picture in there,

50:59.480 --> 51:04.960
it shows Mario running from snowballs and there are no arrows on the screen. So it makes

51:04.960 --> 51:09.440
you think that it's some kind of mini-game. So I think it's definite that there's got

51:09.440 --> 51:14.120
to be a minigame that's going to turn up in here somewhere. All it really is, is it comes

51:14.120 --> 51:19.440
down to, look, Konami made a DDR pad. Okay, now we don't have to make another power pad,

51:19.440 --> 51:26.480
so let's make another power pad game. That's what it is. I just, Nintendo I think is finally

51:26.480 --> 51:29.780
realizing they missed the boat on DDR, they should have had this a long time ago. And

51:29.780 --> 51:36.380
that Mad Catz game, what the hell was that MC Groove thing? Okay, that is a bastardization

51:36.380 --> 51:41.300
of a dance game. Don't even waste your time. That doesn't count. We're not going to acknowledge

51:41.300 --> 51:46.560
that game any further on this show. Period. You know which game I'm talking about. I'm

51:46.560 --> 51:51.680
not going to say the name on air. It's by that company that puts out the mediocre dance

51:51.680 --> 51:56.340
pads and put out this really, really below average game on the GameCube that Islander

51:56.340 --> 52:02.520
talked about last week. Yeah, exactly. Or you can play Parents Just Don't Understand

52:02.520 --> 52:06.240
for like 5 minutes, because they don't cut their songs down, and then the arrows don't

52:06.240 --> 52:09.240
make any sense at all. And they come from the middle of the screen. What the hell?

52:09.240 --> 52:14.920
Oh, you can play In the Groove. I would, I would play In the Groove for 3 days straight

52:14.920 --> 52:19.640
before I would ever touch that other game. Yes, Angel? You look like you have a comment.

52:19.640 --> 52:23.080
I feel a little scared, because you were just talking about the whole Mario thing, and what

52:23.080 --> 52:29.240
shirt am I wearing? Oops! There you go, you're in the mood, you're being festive. Alright.

52:29.240 --> 52:31.240
I'm wearing my DDR freak shirt.

52:31.240 --> 52:32.240
Yay!

52:32.240 --> 52:33.240
Wow.

52:33.240 --> 52:36.520
Oh, now if you two merged your shirts, you'd have this new game.

52:36.520 --> 52:40.120
Very true, in a weird sort of way, yeah.

52:40.120 --> 52:41.120
Scary.

52:41.120 --> 52:46.680
The working title of this game is Dance Dance Revolution with Mario.

52:46.680 --> 52:52.360
Konami and Nintendo are co-publishing the title, whatever that means.

52:52.360 --> 52:56.320
Supposedly it's going to have a two player mode and there will be a dance mat that comes

52:56.320 --> 52:58.320
with the game so we won't have to worry about.

52:58.320 --> 53:02.560
But you know that Red Octane's gonna put out a Red Octane 3.0 dance pad that'll have

53:02.560 --> 53:06.360
Xbox, GameCube, and PlayStation outputs. You know that'll happen.

53:06.360 --> 53:11.720
Uh, minigames. It looks like it's gonna come out summer of 2005 is when this game is

53:11.720 --> 53:12.600
scheduled to come out.

53:12.600 --> 53:18.480
Uh, we're gonna get the first peek at the game at the 2005 World Hobby Fair, and that

53:18.480 --> 53:19.400
happens on Tokyo-

53:19.400 --> 53:22.800
in Tokyo on January 16th.

53:22.800 --> 53:27.960
So, by this time next week, we oughta know some more details on this game, so

53:27.960 --> 53:35.720
we'll definitely pass it along to you as soon as we know all right any any wishes

53:35.720 --> 53:39.920
you guys hope to see with this game the dance dance revolution with Mario game

53:39.920 --> 53:48.520
anything on your wish list I want the the swimming music to be in there but do

53:48.520 --> 53:53.720
do do do do do do do don't make me break out my cell phone I don't know how they

53:53.720 --> 54:00.080
would um no no you don't have to be in there speaking of cell phones all right

54:00.080 --> 54:03.480
meantime while she's digging for that angel wish list for this dead sets

54:03.480 --> 54:08.880
revolution I was gonna say a remix of the water music myself but if we can't

54:08.880 --> 54:16.280
have that and I guess the with a level two music the blue level after the first

54:16.280 --> 54:17.280
The blue level.

54:17.280 --> 54:18.280
No.

54:18.280 --> 54:19.280
Here we go.

54:22.280 --> 54:23.280
Yes!

54:23.280 --> 54:25.280
Super Mario World!

54:25.280 --> 54:26.280
Yay!

54:26.280 --> 54:29.280
Can you really dance to that?

54:29.280 --> 54:30.280
Yes.

54:30.280 --> 54:31.280
And it really messed up straight away.

54:31.280 --> 54:32.280
Sure.

54:32.280 --> 54:33.280
It's kinda hard.

54:36.280 --> 54:40.280
I want the campfire medley from Donkey Konga.

54:43.280 --> 54:44.280
I love my phone.

54:44.280 --> 54:48.280
It's a medley of all these campfire zones. That's pretty good quality.

54:48.280 --> 54:52.280
Loki, your wishlist for Dance Dance Revolution with Mario.

54:52.280 --> 54:58.280
That that be the only game they release on the GameCube for DDR.

54:58.280 --> 55:03.280
Why you gotta hate? Why you being such a hater with this? I've gotta know.

55:03.280 --> 55:06.280
It's gonna suck just like Donkey Konga.

55:06.280 --> 55:10.280
I didn't think Donkey Konga sucked. There could have been more to-

55:10.280 --> 55:12.280
Okay, we get the idea, Jimmy. Seriously, we get it.

55:12.280 --> 55:20.280
I was wondering when you'd say something.

55:20.280 --> 55:25.280
Donkey Kong, there could have been more to it, but, you know, it wasn't a bad game.

55:25.280 --> 55:28.280
Yeah, it was. Whatever.

55:28.280 --> 55:30.280
Alright.

55:30.280 --> 55:37.280
My wish list, I want to see Princess Peach as a dancing character, and whenever the stage is over, she'll go,

55:37.280 --> 55:39.280
Peach is the winner!

55:39.280 --> 55:53.280
Dude, they should have Princess Peach in the Emi costume that was shown at the Ultramix 2 demo at E3 when Emi was all hoochified. They need that, but Princess Peach would be awesome.

55:53.280 --> 56:15.280
Sigh. I can't wait to find out more information about this game. I actually think this game has the potential to be very cool because Nintendo, they've just got such classic songs and it's going to be so cute. It's probably going to be geared for kids and it'll probably end up being like Oh Ha DDR, but I don't care. Or Disney's Rave, Disney's Mix, whatever you call it.

56:15.280 --> 56:19.760
By the way, we need more kiddie DDR.

56:19.760 --> 56:23.760
We need to get them hooked young, like crack.

56:23.760 --> 56:28.400
It starts with the cigarettes and they move on to crack before you know it they're all

56:28.400 --> 56:32.800
on LSD and then it's like they have a DDR.

56:32.800 --> 56:38.760
We get them hooked young, they move up to 2DX and then Dance Me Next and then before

56:38.760 --> 56:43.240
you know it they're shaking their asses to deluxe on Pada Pada.

56:43.240 --> 56:47.040
It's reminded me of that one, what was that one game that you guys kept talking about

56:47.040 --> 56:50.920
like a long time ago?

56:50.920 --> 56:52.600
Jungle Book or something?

56:52.600 --> 56:56.520
Oh god, the game that got me a dance pad for the first time.

56:56.520 --> 56:57.520
You had that tiny thing.

56:57.520 --> 56:58.520
I did.

56:58.520 --> 56:59.520
It was, okay.

56:59.520 --> 57:01.240
And I had to bring you Third Mix to fix that.

57:01.240 --> 57:05.920
This was, it was the very first US release of a dancing game.

57:05.920 --> 57:08.720
This was out before Dance Dance Revolution USA.

57:08.720 --> 57:10.600
And it was the Jungle Book Dance Game.

57:10.600 --> 57:14.840
It was put out by, I don't remember what the game, it was Jungle Groove, yeah I think it

57:14.840 --> 57:16.360
was called Jungle Groove.

57:16.360 --> 57:20.320
And it actually came with a little dance mat, but the dance mat was made for like a five

57:20.320 --> 57:21.320
year old.

57:21.320 --> 57:24.980
But I bought it because I wanted a dance mat.

57:24.980 --> 57:29.400
And it was this, I remember that Lou Bega was in it, because like he did a cover of

57:29.400 --> 57:32.760
that song that went, I wanna walk like you, talk like you too.

57:32.760 --> 57:34.760
Remember that song from the Jungle Book?

57:34.760 --> 57:38.320
And that was like the big song you could unlock if you played it enough.

57:38.320 --> 57:42.800
Loki, you're still giving EDS Evil's death stare over here.

57:42.800 --> 57:48.180
Like I said before, this is why they do not need to make any more games for the GameCube

57:48.180 --> 57:53.240
that feature DDR. Or, I know this was like for the Nintendo 64. It still sucked. It's

57:53.240 --> 57:57.320
still a Nintendo game. It sucked. This game actually was a PlayStation. This was a PlayStation

57:57.320 --> 58:03.280
game that I bought. It still sucked. And I remember that this was right when I was starting

58:03.280 --> 58:07.760
to get into DDR, and I finally remember that Jamie and some other folks all came to my

58:07.760 --> 58:12.740
apartment and Jamie actually brought a little plug a mod plug that would plug

58:12.740 --> 58:16.520
into the back of the PlayStation the game killer the game killer and then she

58:16.520 --> 58:23.320
bought a brought a copy of third mix and we played DDR third mix on my little

58:23.320 --> 58:27.760
jungle book dance mat that's made for five-year-olds and I don't remember I

58:27.760 --> 58:33.520
think it was lanky style was dancing a graduizic cyber funny stuff on that

58:33.520 --> 58:41.220
little five-year-old dance pad memories finally the damn thing broke time ago

58:41.220 --> 58:46.720
the down arrow broke on that thing after like a week this was what four years ago

58:46.720 --> 58:53.640
a long time ago no it was winter when did I get into DDR winter of 2000 so I

58:53.640 --> 58:57.680
think it was probably that January because I met everybody in September ish

58:57.680 --> 59:03.440
yeah after no it was a little later because a guana girl night and get into

59:03.440 --> 59:11.440
We first played DDR at the Rocky Ore Convention, it was October of 2000, and we found the Golf Land machine December of 2000.

59:11.440 --> 59:12.440
That's when we really started to do it.

59:12.440 --> 59:13.440
So it was early 2001 then?

59:13.440 --> 59:14.440
It was early 2001.

59:14.440 --> 59:15.440
When it was in the winter time.

59:15.440 --> 59:22.440
I didn't even know we had machines in town until September of 2000.

59:22.440 --> 59:26.440
When I would go play the 1.5.

59:26.440 --> 59:30.440
Oh yes, and play Boom Boom Dollar over and over again.

59:30.440 --> 59:33.440
You remember what the trick code was? I don't even remember what it was.

59:33.440 --> 59:36.440
It was like left, left, down, down, right, right, or something. I don't remember.

59:36.440 --> 59:38.440
No, it was the running steps.

59:38.440 --> 59:39.440
Was it left, down, right, down, left?

59:39.440 --> 59:41.440
Left, down, right, down, left.

59:41.440 --> 59:44.440
I thought there was... you had to hit one of them twice.

59:44.440 --> 59:47.440
No, it was... that was for Maniac.

59:47.440 --> 59:53.440
Back in my day, you didn't get to just push the little button and be on Maniac steps.

59:53.440 --> 59:54.440
You had to do the little...

59:54.440 --> 59:59.440
We didn't have Vivid! We had... they were all one color and we liked it!

59:59.440 --> 01:00:03.980
And it wasn't called Heavy, it was called Maniac, because you had to be one to play

01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:04.980
on it.

01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:08.620
And we had one paranoia mix!

01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:09.620
Absolutely.

01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:11.500
This was so bad.

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:13.840
Preach on.

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:18.180
Now I'm all in the mood for some nostalgic DDR music.

01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:19.180
So I think we're going to take a break.

01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:24.020
And when we come back from this break, more stuff, including tonight's cage match.

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:28.180
We're going to do a list list tonight at some point, and who knows what else.

01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:35.180
So we'll be back after this, enjoy!

01:00:58.180 --> 01:01:04.180
Tell me, why-y-y-y-y, you keep the pockets full of grim, grim dollars

01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:07.180
I love you like the time

01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:11.180
You're very hard, you speak like a young fella

01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:15.180
Take me overnight

01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:18.180
Boom, boom, boom, boom, something like a bubble

01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:22.180
Boom, boom, boom, boom, back to your world

01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:25.180
Boom, boom, boom, boom, pushing all the buttons

01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:27.180
Oh

01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:28.780
P.M.P. is a tab, tune chaos, don't ask if you can

01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:30.780
I'm so hypnotized, P.M.P. is a tab, tune

01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:32.780
P.M.P. is a tab, tune

01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:34.780
You think what I said, if you didn't bring something

01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:36.780
You don't sleep when I eat, you see stuff that might blossom

01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:38.380
It don't take time for me to blow your mind

01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:40.380
It take a second to reckon because you dumb and blossom

01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:42.780
Just rap, but you a empty climber of the circus

01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:45.980
P.M.P. is a tab, tune chaos, don't ask if you can

01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:47.980
I'm so hypnotized, I know the pause and the loosen

01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:49.980
Like a magician, he draws a rabbit out of the hat, son

01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:52.780
I'm doing more like a 44th magnet, MC3, stop and don't listen

01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:54.780
They try to imagine, just traveling the speed of light

01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:38.020
Come on, make up, here we go Jumpin' and jumpin' and jumpin'

01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:40.380
Everybody just jump over and down Feelin' like it's down

01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:21.380
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because Real Radio makes Captain Jack cry.

01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:29.380
You know the thing I realized about that promo? What is Real Radio anymore these days, honestly?

01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:33.380
Everyone's on the serious network. Maybe we should go on the serious network.

01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:37.380
Seriously? I made it funny, I made it funny.

01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:38.380
Oh! Woof woof!

01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:39.380
Ugh...

01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:41.380
Between...

01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:42.380
Serious, he's a dog star.

01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:44.380
Between...like...you know, typical...

01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:45.380
Serious black.

01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:48.380
FCC licensed black commercial corporate over the air radio.

01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:52.380
And now you got satellite radio, internet radio and now podcasting.

01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:54.380
There's so much radio these days.

01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:57.380
You just fill your ears with oral pleasure.

01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:00.380
Anyways...

01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:02.380
Man's still trying to bring us down.

01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:03.380
I know, I know.

01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:06.380
I just...I'm having fun watching the chat room there over at

01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:13.660
www.orangeonsradio.com, click on chat. They're just talking about the DDR Mario game and

01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:17.500
just expectations. Some people are already saying, it's going to suck. Game's going to

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:25.100
suck. It's going to be horrible. Worst game ever. We shall see. We shall soon see. Somebody

01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:30.100
was talking about, then somehow the chat in the chat room went on to playing DDR with

01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:35.260
a light gun. Like I guess shooting out other people's arrows or something. I have no idea.

01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:42.260
That would be kind of fun though if you could like, yee-haw, it would be like country dancing, where you dance and shoot. What the hell? That's funny.

01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:43.260
Redneck Revolution.

01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:45.260
Yeah, Redneck Revolution, I don't know. Yes, Angel?

01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:48.260
Completely off-topic and has nothing to do with the money at all.

01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:50.260
Oh, what isn't on this show?

01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:56.260
The nail button in You Don't Know Jack where you just keep hitting the end button.

01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:57.260
Oh, the screw?

01:07:57.260 --> 01:08:00.260
Yes, there's a screw. That's right, that's key. That's right.

01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:04.260
But, yeah, that's what it reminded me of when you said Light Gun and DDR Mario. There was no one going,

01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:08.260
No!

01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:12.260
Oh, boy. Alright. I hope this, you know, we don't know

01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:16.260
for sure if DDR Mario is even going to come to America.

01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:20.260
It's so far, you know, all the writings in Japanese, so, but I would...

01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:24.260
Loki says no plans, but I say it's gotta happen.

01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:28.260
They would be idiots not to port this to the US.

01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:32.380
Not even that. All you need is freeloader. I know, but I don't even...

01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:37.500
I want to play a US mix. Nintendo would be absolute morons to not bring this

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:38.060
game

01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:43.620
to the US. Absolute morons.

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:48.260
Yeah. No, actually, no they wouldn't. Keep it far away from the states.

01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:51.300
Far, far away. Stop hating. Don't hate.

01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:56.980
Don't hate. Alright. We're going to get into the cage match here pretty shortly. However,

01:08:56.980 --> 01:09:02.980
First, I want to allow the Loki here to give us an update on what's going on in the Sim world.

01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:34.980
The Gravity Dark Sakura Burn Nation Mix, and Legend of Tack on there.

01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:48.980
And he's also done some other cool songs, so go check those out on BomaniStyle, and if I'm nice, I might go and link them in the LiveJournal community for Orange Launch Radio, which you can find on LiveJournal.

01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:55.980
I'm so glad you took the opportunity to hoard that out. Yes, check out our LiveJournal community. Just go to orangelaunchradio.com.

01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:58.980
You're being immortalized in the sim file. That's rad.

01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:01.980
And one of them is your song.

01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:02.980
Yeah, I know.

01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:05.980
And your name's on the background and everything. It's pretty cool.

01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:07.980
God damn, I feel important.

01:10:07.980 --> 01:10:11.980
So yeah, that's pretty much all that's happened other than that, you know,

01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:16.980
DDRUK suffered a, I don't know, server crash.

01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:21.980
But they say that they're pretty much done with the UltraMix 2 sim files

01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:27.340
files, and they should be released in a week or so, I think. That's what I heard. Um, because

01:10:27.340 --> 01:10:31.540
they were just finishing up the last bits of, uh, the beginner steps, and that was pretty

01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:36.460
much all that was left. So those should be coming out soon, and, um, DDR Maniacs is still

01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:45.700
down, and, yeah, I think that's pretty much it. So nothing really going on. Just a dead.

01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:52.700
Everyone's still kinda coming off the holiday.

01:10:53.180 --> 01:10:55.140
Angel.

01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:58.100
Yeah, I can talk. Okay, my bad.

01:10:58.100 --> 01:10:58.980
Um...

01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:02.360
Actually, that new skin thing, the technofeen skin,

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:03.940
the third one,

01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:04.740
uh...

01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:08.060
Mikey and I, uh, Big Red Pimp in the chat room,

01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:10.320
uh... we decided to

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:13.980
try playing that online mode this week. That was pretty weird.

01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:18.860
He kicked my butt twice. How does that work? I haven't really tried the online mode.

01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:22.060
You have to like... Is it laggy? No. Oh really?

01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:24.580
No. It's pretty good.

01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:26.500
You like have to have a...

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:30.920
You have to put your own IP in it and then you set up the server that way.

01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:34.980
And then when people try to connect to it they just put in your IP and then

01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:37.480
it just works from there. It's pretty cool.

01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:41.140
There is a front end for all this, just so people know. It's out there.

01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:43.740
I can't remember the website but there is a front end and

01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:50.100
actual community base are at it so if you search you'll find it yeah it's in

01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:55.480
options just go down to network and then yeah it's pretty a self-explanatory from

01:11:55.480 --> 01:12:01.720
there all right uh if that's it for the sim news then I think we're gonna have

01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:08.280
ourselves a cage match how's that sound all right let's have a cage match last

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:22.280
Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage match, Loki put in the most panned song ever in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage match, getting a zero from every single person in the room, including himself.

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:27.280
Will he have his revenge this week? We shall soon see.

01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:39.280
The chat room pick is now out because it got bumped out last week by Jamie's pick, which is a little song called Joe La Taxi, and who knew that anybody liked anything French?

01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:41.280
But our chat room apparently dug it.

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:43.280
I feel like it's French as sung by a Japanese girl.

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:46.280
Yeah, it's a cute song. I'm kind of glad it won. It was a cute one.

01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:47.280
I like it.

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:53.440
And since the chat room choice is out, that option may come back in a later week, but

01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:54.440
not tonight.

01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:57.920
I'm coming back in with a choice of my own, and we shall see.

01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:02.760
And I've decided just now, after seeing what all the songs are in Cage Match tonight, I've

01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:08.120
decided just now, I took a poll in the room about which song they wanted to see me put

01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:12.960
in Cage Match tonight, and I've decided to go against that, and do what I feel like doing.

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:17.960
Well, I took a poll too to see what song I should put in Cage Match, and you picked this one, so...

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:21.960
Ah! I laugh.

01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:24.960
Very interesting. All right, let's start off with a clip of last week's under...

01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:27.960
Oh yes, a reminder on the way to Cage Match works.

01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:31.960
It used to be songs that we think would be good in a DDR or other Bomani game,

01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:33.960
but now it's just kind of turned into whatever's cool.

01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:37.960
Three songs, each host picks a song, puts it in the Cage Match.

01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:43.960

01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:20.220
Jola Taxi for short. Enjoy.

01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:50.220
If people keep me, don't I care?

01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:57.220
La música ajo, se la rumba

01:15:57.220 --> 01:16:02.220
Le je roc o mambo

01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:39.180
Alright though, song number one, and I'm only going to read this one more time because somebody missed the name. Pay attention.

01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:47.620
Oria Posey with Joe LaTaxi, the Jan Wayne remix radio cut. There you go. Let's move into song number two.

01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:55.020
Song number two is Loki's pick tonight. What did you pick, Loki?

01:16:55.020 --> 01:17:11.020
Well, everyone in the studio here voted for the Wild Card song, and guess what, you see, last week I put in a song by a group called ProdigyRemix.com, that's the Girls IDIOTECH remix.

01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:23.020
Well, you didn't like that too much, so you know what, I said, fuck it, I don't give a shit what you like, so you know what, I put in the original, so fucking, you get Girls again.

01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:29.340
And if I can find a goddamn another remix of this song I will put it in next week too. So suck it. Here's girls

01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:39.340
Song number two, Prodigy with Girls. Enjoy.

01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:06.340
All about the world, tell us what it's like to fall in love

01:18:29.340 --> 01:18:55.340
All around the world, still don't know where I'll be, don't know since you're here with me

01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:27.960
It wouldn't be to be us if I'm making cash money

01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:30.960
Going to all around the world to tell stories of that

01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:32.960
All the young love for sure

01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:35.960
All the fun making cash money

01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:49.460
Out of the bag

01:19:49.460 --> 01:20:15.580
We need glass, we need glass We need glass, we need glass

01:21:45.580 --> 01:22:03.660
Jamie, your thoughts?

01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:08.500
I guess it didn't make it on the air, so that last ehhhhh part, I'm like, if you'd like

01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:14.580
to make a phone call, please sing us and try again, or deposit 25 cents.

01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:18.660
actually like that one a whole lot better but it has some annoying parts so

01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:23.880
it gets like a six all right six not a zero six from Jamie I'm actually

01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:29.860
surprised six from Jamie angel I'm gonna be nice and give it a four it wasn't as

01:22:29.860 --> 01:22:35.860
bad as last week so whatever yeah I know shit angel gives everything like a nine

01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:42.300
or a ten and she gave that a four that's not nice it's better than zero yeah you

01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:49.340
you got a point all right loki it gets a girls because i want everyone every time to hear the

01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:55.740
word girls to think of this song and it will be foreverly imprinted on your brain you'll never be

01:22:55.740 --> 01:23:01.420
able to forget the song no matter how bad it sucks it will just stick with you like the goddamn ketchup

01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:10.220
song and milkshake song it's just gonna it's just everybody's gonna hear girls and just think of

01:23:10.220 --> 01:23:15.460
of that, so it's going to be brainwashed into your head. Anyways, I give it a hundred, because

01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:22.380
it's awesome. Because I just, the agony of the chatroom felt as well, worth that one

01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:27.900
hundred. And it looks like we lost only twenty percent of our listeners this week during

01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:36.620
that song. Good job. My thoughts, let's see. If you were to take a pile of dog shit, and

01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:40.940
you put it in a nice shoebox and you put that shoebox in nice wrapping and then you paint

01:23:40.940 --> 01:23:45.100
it with glitter and then you tie it up a nice little bow and then you put a little ribbon

01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:49.900
on it and it's a little sparkling and then you put you know you plate it in gold and

01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:58.000
then you cover it in money you still have dog shit but it wasn't as bad as last week

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:05.960
so I give it a one that's more like a dog fart all right but it doesn't matter what

01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:10.360
we think it matters what you guys think so we will soon see but it's my turn

01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:16.100
here it is my song and I asked the chat room what they are I'm sorry I asked the

01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:19.900
studio what they wanted to hear if they wanted to hear a former Spice Girl but

01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:23.960
and that's the one they chose but I decided you know what I'm gonna go with

01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:29.460
this one I cannot let Prodigy win so I've got to bring out the big guns and I

01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:32.860
truly think this is the better song it's when I've been listening into my car all

01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:37.620
week it's a group called flower power is the name of the group and they have a

01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:44.620
guest singer on this one it's Danny Minow no yes yes again another Mario

01:24:44.620 --> 01:24:49.420
reference please kill me here we go this is Danny Minow I'm sorry it's flower

01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:56.420
Power Power featuring Danny Minow with a song called, You Won't Forget About Me. Enjoy.

01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:25.420
I'm not nothing that I will remember

01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:32.420
I'll never feel the same again

01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:35.420
I'm not nothing that I will remember

01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:38.420
Living the dream

01:25:38.420 --> 01:25:41.420
I'm breathing light and deep

01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:43.420
Let it go

01:25:43.420 --> 01:25:46.420

Couldn't know Yeah, so good to know about you

So if you can't love me, then why would you leave.

01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:15.360
I'm going to let you all over you.

01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:18.860
If you can't love me, I promise you this.

01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:22.320
I'm going to have you near me.

01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:29.780
When you can't love me, I'll hear the music of wonderland.

01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:51.220
I need a mystery, I'm breathing in deep Then I hear you say, as you drift away

01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:56.860
And it's good to know, it's good to know, that I'm here

01:26:56.860 --> 01:27:01.340
Won't you come at me, it's gonna be you

01:27:01.340 --> 01:27:07.020

01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:56.120
Want it all on repeat

01:27:56.120 --> 01:28:02.120

That's for next week.

01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:47.640
No, I'm kidding.

01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:48.640
All right.

01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:52.200
That was Danny Minnow with You Won't Forget About Me.

01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:56.640
Let's see if we won't be able to forget that song or if we'd rather would forget it.

01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:57.640
Jamie.

01:28:57.640 --> 01:28:58.640
It wasn't bad.

01:28:58.640 --> 01:28:59.640
It didn't suck.

01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:01.640
Angel!

01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:03.640

01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:11.640
I forgot about the song.

01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:13.640
I'm sorry, Danny Minogue sucks.

01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:15.640
It's just a fucking clone of Kylie Minogue.

01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:17.640
So, you know what?

01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:19.640
I don't like it. I'm sorry, it's a four.

01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:24.640
I like that song because it's very disco,

01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:26.640
and it has a very catchy hook,

01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:28.640

Come to think of it, don't vote for song number two, please. Alright.

01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:48.700
Oh wait, I gotta be impartial. My bad, my bad.

01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:52.700
Alright. So.

01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:56.700
What now? Yes, Loki. And if this doesn't win,

01:30:56.700 --> 01:31:00.700
I have more girls to go in for next week.

01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:04.700
Jamie, we need to institute some new rule against that.

01:31:04.700 --> 01:31:08.700
Jamie, help me come up with a rule so Loki cannot put in another remix of Girls next week.

01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:12.700
If he loses. Um, the other veto power.

01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:16.700
The veto power? The veto power. Alright, veto power's in.

01:31:16.700 --> 01:31:20.700
Yep, yep. And let's take a vote. Who votes that we do the veto power next week?

01:31:20.700 --> 01:31:24.700
And who votes we don't do the veto power next week?

01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:28.700
Two against one, Loki loses. Oh shit! It sucks to be you.

01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:32.700
Although I actually kind of liked the original.

01:31:32.700 --> 01:31:36.700
The original. To Loki's credit, the original wasn't as bad as

01:31:36.700 --> 01:31:40.700
the one last week. But it was still pretty bad.

01:31:40.700 --> 01:31:44.700
I just, we've got to encourage Loki to expand his horizons.

01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:48.700
But then he's just going to go and put echo image in or something.

01:31:48.700 --> 01:31:52.700
We'll see. Oh, and look at the chatroom.

01:31:52.700 --> 01:31:56.700
They're all raising their hand as well. Too bad they don't get a vote. Alright.

01:31:56.700 --> 01:32:00.700
We'll see what happens. What? They get a vote?

01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:04.700
Yeah, they get their vote right now. They're voting for their favorite song. Either

01:32:04.700 --> 01:32:08.700
Jola Taxi or Girls or Danny. We'll see.

01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:13.180
Moving on, what else is going on in the, uh, gaming world right now?

01:32:13.180 --> 01:32:16.020
You talked about that you'd actually played some Bomani this week, Jamie?

01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:20.220
Just 2DX. Just 2DX? Oh, I thought you actually had gone out to the arcade or something.

01:32:20.220 --> 01:32:23.900
No. Oh. My bad. I haven't had time.

01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:28.140
You know, I, I want to go out to the arcade, but I'm just, I, I can't, I can't get my...

01:32:28.140 --> 01:32:31.380
motivation. I've actually been tempted to redownload

01:32:31.380 --> 01:32:34.700
the BM98. Why is that? Just because I miss it.

01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:36.820
It's so fun.

01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:41.260
What was so great about it? Just the fact that you could... It was the Metal Gear song, but it had the

01:32:41.260 --> 01:32:45.460
whole first level of Metal Gear.

01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:49.460
Alright.

01:32:49.460 --> 01:32:52.900
I need to go out to the arcade sometime this week and play some DDR. We should have like a DDR

01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:54.940
night or something.

01:32:54.940 --> 01:32:57.380
I know, I know.

01:32:57.380 --> 01:32:58.940
Alright, well

01:32:58.940 --> 01:33:02.260
Gee, I guess we're going to take a break and when we come back from the break we'll

01:33:02.260 --> 01:33:07.420
We'll find out who won Cage Match and we will have ourselves a list list for this evening,

01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:08.900
so be thinking about that.

01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:09.900
Rob.

01:33:09.900 --> 01:33:10.900
Yes.

01:33:10.900 --> 01:33:11.900
Rob.

01:33:11.900 --> 01:33:12.900
Yes.

01:33:12.900 --> 01:33:13.900
Rob.

01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:14.900
What?

01:33:14.900 --> 01:33:15.900
Rob.

01:33:15.900 --> 01:33:16.900
What?

01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:17.900
Rob.

01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:18.900
Rob.

01:33:18.900 --> 01:33:19.900
Rob.

01:33:19.900 --> 01:33:20.900
Rob.

01:33:20.900 --> 01:33:21.900
Rob.

01:33:21.900 --> 01:33:22.900
Rob.

01:33:22.900 --> 01:33:23.900
Rob.

01:33:23.900 --> 01:33:24.900
Rob.

01:33:24.900 --> 01:33:25.900
Rob.

01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:26.900
Rob.

01:33:26.900 --> 01:33:27.900
Rob.

01:33:27.900 --> 01:33:28.900
Rob.

01:33:28.900 --> 01:33:29.900
Rob.

01:33:29.900 --> 01:33:30.900
Rob.

01:33:30.900 --> 01:33:31.900
Rob.

01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:37.660
The tonight's list list topic is, game we most would like to see, I'm sorry, video game

01:33:37.660 --> 01:33:40.900
we would most like to see in 2005.

01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:44.740
Now that doesn't mean it has to actually be a game that has been announced, although it

01:33:44.740 --> 01:33:45.800
could be.

01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:50.380
You could make something up, but just video game I most want to see so I can buy it in

01:33:50.380 --> 01:33:51.380
2005.

01:33:51.380 --> 01:33:52.380
That's tonight's topic.

01:33:52.380 --> 01:33:58.140
When we come back from this break of music featuring songs from DDR Solo, because I just

01:33:58.140 --> 01:34:01.340
want an excuse to play Temple of Love.

01:34:01.340 --> 01:34:06.340
So we'll be back after this. Enjoy.

01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:08.340
Don't forget, vote on tonight's cage match.

01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:57.340
Come to the capital of love in your heart Make some joy and the death is my sorrow

01:34:57.340 --> 01:35:00.340
Sex is all the power helping you through the midnight hour

01:35:00.340 --> 01:35:04.340
And the secret of love and peace, soul and heart, it will release

01:35:04.340 --> 01:35:07.700
So, for your head of prey, it's gonna take your fear away

01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:11.700
Flyin' like a snow adult, out of the temple of love

01:35:12.700 --> 01:35:14.700
Come into the temple of love

01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:19.700
And together we'll pray to the heavens above

01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:21.700
Come into the temple of love

01:38:21.700 --> 01:38:27.200
Dream a dream, no but not just a dream If you wanna go for free, boy you're makin' me scream

01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:30.200
Ooh la la la la la la

01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:33.200
Take me any way you please, boy you're makin' me scream

01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:37.200
Ooh la la la la la

01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:41.200
You gotta dream a little dream

01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:56.200
This it take us different ways

01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:06.200
Don't give a fuck to me

01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:08.200
Don't try to stop me

01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:10.200
Don't wait up and go

01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:14.200
Yo, don't block me, don't be, just block me

01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:18.200
Don't try to stop me, don't wait up and go

01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:20.200
Don't block me

01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:21.200
Crop it like a nut, crack a crush is a nut

01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:23.200
Sizzle survivor for my rifle when I'm on the cut

01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:25.200
After end your memory, I like to say to you first

01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:27.200
I done you like Gatorade when I'm quitching my dirt

01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:29.200
I'm the back of the ladder and you're the stable

01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:31.200
I'll catch you like my DJ cuts a record on the table

01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:33.200
I wanna rock, get off the battleground

01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:35.200
You're no map, swear to God, I'll talk and beat you down

01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:37.200
Crack a sword, I'll put you in a muzzle

01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:39.200
I'll break you in pieces like a jigsaw puzzle

01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:40.800
I'll ring your rimes, and I'll murder your style.

01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:42.800
I'm the one doing the saying, yeah you're on trial.

01:39:42.900 --> 01:39:43.440
I'm conducting.

01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:44.780
I'm rainin when it all in place.

01:39:44.780 --> 01:39:46.640
Form a line such as this so you can bleed your key.

01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:47.840
I want to rock, rock!

01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:49.180
Rock.

01:39:49.180 --> 01:39:49.680
Get it.

01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:50.180
Rock.

01:39:50.180 --> 01:39:50.680
Run.

01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:51.160
Don't beat.

01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:52.640
Just rock me.

01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:54.120
Don't try to stop me.

01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:55.580
Don't wait up.

01:39:55.580 --> 01:39:59.060
And yo, don't clock me to beat.

01:39:59.060 --> 01:40:00.060
Just rock me.

01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:02.040
Don't try to stop me.

01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:04.180
Yo.

01:40:04.180 --> 01:40:08.520
Don't try to climb in.

01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:12.520
gaming radio, so uncensored

01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:16.520
that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:20.520
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:24.520
We're back

01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:28.520
here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:32.520
Tom Brokaw, our buddy. We miss him already, don't we? That other guy is not quite as cool.

01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:36.520
Alright, you guys ready to hear who won tonight's cage match?

01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:41.880
Alright. I'll tell you what guys, it was a landslide vote.

01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:48.120
Every song got a couple of votes, but tonight's winner was an absolute landslide.

01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:51.480
Getting twice as many votes as the other two songs combined.

01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:55.440
What do you think? What do you think? All that being said, who do you think won it?

01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:59.080
Loki says my song. What do you think, Jamie?

01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:03.480
I think I don't care. I think you don't care. What do you think, Loki?

01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:08.600
Yeah, just kidding angel, what do you think I already know so I can't say I

01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:12.160
Guess I'll say

01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:18.880
Guys these that are toss-up between jammies or yours. All right. Well, let's see. It's nice cage match winner is

01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:22.560
Don't look taxi

01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:25.160
I

01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:29.840
Actually kind of thought that it would be yours blew the other two songs out of the freaking water

01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:33.360
I got two more where that came from, baby.

01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:35.840
Well, thank you, chatroom. You really love me.

01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:41.520
Alright. Actually, I'm not so sure if it's that they love you as they hated the other two songs.

01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:43.520
Well, I know. Your song was kind of cool. I liked it.

01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:47.760
Alright. Alright, so, Joel attacks. He wins it two weeks in a row.

01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:52.960
Alright. Loki's going to keep trying, though. He wants to put girls up again next week,

01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:56.240
so we'll see what happens. I'm going to tell you, you're going to keep losing, too.

01:41:56.240 --> 01:42:01.040
next yet another week I don't have to pick a song thank you everybody then

01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:05.480
next week we haven't had a two-week winner since well Gwen Stefani wasn't

01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:10.440
that long ago I suppose how was the last song we had to retire all right all

01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:15.920
right all right let's get into tonight's list list now let's explain the way

01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:19.520
list list works because I know a lot of you guys are new to orange lounge radio

01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:24.040
whether it be through the DER freak repeats which are on Friday nights at

01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:27.360
6 o'clock if you ever miss this show by the way on DDR Freak Radio or through

01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:31.360
the podcast so it's very possible you haven't heard list list before basically

01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:38.920
what we do is we are making a definitive list through our own process each host

01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:44.080
and guest nominates three songs that should be on the list and then we go

01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:48.040
around and we each eliminate one song and then you guys in the chat room vote

01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:55.000
and we come up with the definitive list. So tonight's list is going to be video

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:59.240
game you most want to see in 2005. And this can be something that's already

01:42:59.240 --> 01:43:05.640
been announced. This could be something that you just are have a dream about. It

01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:08.960
could be just about anything. We're really not setting any limits on this. So let's

01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:13.460

01:43:13.460 --> 01:43:16.800

01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:01.640
I'm never prepared.

01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:04.960
All right, let's see, who wants to start us off?

01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:05.960
Jamie.

01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:06.960
Why the hell not?

01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:09.080
You always start off these segments, so why not?

01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:10.080
Why the hell not?

01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:12.080
You're number three pick.

01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:15.120
Pimp My Ride the Game.

01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:19.920
After all, you know, and all of those racing games they have where you can customize your

01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:23.560
car and everything. They just need a game of nothing but that because that's the most

01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:29.320
fun. Pimp my ride the game. Pimp my ride the game. That's pretty creative. I got to give

01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:36.240
that to you. That's good. All right. Loki, your number three pick. This one just came

01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:41.800
to me now. It's just like an epiphany. This one is going to have similar game play to...

01:45:41.800 --> 01:45:49.040
Oh, I got to get the giggles out. Calm. Okay. It's going to have similar game play to Katamari

01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:56.200
Dimashii. I think it'd be very popular because everybody, you know, has these. They can identify

01:45:56.200 --> 01:46:08.600
with them. It's roll my SUV the game. Cause you know, those SUVs, they like the roll.

01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:13.840
I don't get it or something. Can you explain the joke please for the mentally challenged

01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:18.960
such as myself? Giant fucking vehicles that have no point in being on a roll.

01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:26.960
On a road, okay, and people drive them out around like they're race cars, and well, since they have a high center of balance, they tend to roll.

01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:31.960
Like, as in flip over, as in crash, explode, people die.

01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:33.960
Sounds like Burnout 3.

01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:37.960
Sounds like Driver 3. Angel, your number 3 pick, please.

01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:47.960
Okay, I was going to say Actraiser DS, just because I was being serious, but I think I need to steal K-Dash's suggestion, which was DDR Demashi.

01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:50.960
Because it sounded funny.

01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:53.960
And how exactly does DDR Demashi work?

01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:59.960
I have no idea, but it sounded funny at the time, so you know what, he gets a cookie for that one.

01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:05.960
Alright, fair enough. My number three pick, I actually went with a serious one, heaven forbid.

01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:11.960
This is a game that has needed to come out for about the past ten years. Kid Icarus 2005.

01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:13.960
Holy shit, yeah.

01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:19.580
I seriously, seriously don't get it.

01:47:19.580 --> 01:47:23.980
Nintendo has this character, many people still know this character and love this

01:47:23.980 --> 01:47:24.620
character,

01:47:24.620 --> 01:47:28.380
and yet this character is yet to turn up in any type of Super Smash Brothers game

01:47:28.380 --> 01:47:29.100
or anything.

01:47:29.100 --> 01:47:32.660
What the hell? They could do a kick-ass game with Kid Icarus.

01:47:32.660 --> 01:47:37.060
Maybe the next Animal Crossing? I don't know, we'll see.

01:47:37.060 --> 01:47:41.680
We will see what happens. Alright, moving on.

01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:48.040
Number two pick time. Jamie, your number two pick please. The Sims, Sims in the Hood.

01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:53.600
The Sims, Sims in the Hood. But I'm not meaning like the herbs. Okay, yeah. I mean

01:47:53.600 --> 01:48:00.120
like we have ghetto Sims that have to go, you know, pick up their cheese. I need to

01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:05.080
like have like realistic. And I'm gonna spell that Sims with a Z. Oh, I did too.

01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:09.080
Okay, good. Alright. Sims into hood.

01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:13.080
Uh, Loki, your number two pick, please.

01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:17.080
This one's a request by Nellie. She wants the girl game.

01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:21.080
Much like the guy game, but, you know, no breasts and more

01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:25.080
cock shots. You know, funny you should mention this, because

01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:29.080
something similar is going to come up on my list, but we'll see. Uh, Angel, your number

01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:33.080
two pick. You know, I was just looking at the poster over there and I just had to giggle it myself

01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:38.360
because I just picked something completely at random except I don't know if I want to

01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:44.000
call it one thing or the other. Okay, I was either going to say Kill Bill Online or something

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:45.760
just because I was just being completely random.

01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:47.800
So, Kill Bill the game or Kill Bill Online?

01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:48.800
Oops.

01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:49.800
Uh-oh.

01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:50.800
She took my number one.

01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:51.800
I'm sorry.

01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:52.800
Oh, no. All right.

01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:58.040
I have to think of something new now. I had Kill Bill the RPG. That would have been cooler.

01:48:58.040 --> 01:48:59.560
See? You still would have gotten props from me.

01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:01.800
So, do you want Kill Bill the RPG, Angel?

01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:02.800
Yeah.

01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:10.520
and she just stole Jamie's just like that. What a bitch. I hate you. Alright. My number two pick is

01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:17.480
another serious one, heaven forbid. I would like to see a true sequel to

01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:21.840
Castlevania Symphony of the Night and I'm not talking those 3D bullshit. I want

01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:28.720
a 2D, beautiful, I don't care what they do, I want a 2D Castlevania game that

01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:34.440
just fucking sleeps with me, it's that good. So I'm gonna call it Castlevania Symphony

01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:42.640
of the Night 2. Um, then, actually, and now it's for the DC. Yes. Then that is the game

01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:50.280
I'm most, no, okay, then I'm gonna be specific. On PS2, I'm sick of this handheld bullshit.

01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:54.800
I want one on a console. Well, put it on a good system and put it on the Xbox. I don't...

01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:56.400
So it'll actually look good.

01:49:56.400 --> 01:49:58.760
I don't give a shit. I just want it... I don't want it on a

01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:00.560
freakin' handheld. I want it

01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:03.760
on the big TV so I can turn up the speakers

01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:08.680
and blast the shit out of the Castlevania music.

01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:09.960
Anyway, moving on.

01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:11.020
Uh...

01:50:11.020 --> 01:50:13.120
Jamie, did you manage to find a new number one?

01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:15.720
Yeah, I guess so. Okay, what is your new number one?

01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:18.240
Console Ragnarok Online.

01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:22.920
Fully customizable.

01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:26.840
Ragnarok Online to your console. Beautiful.

01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:28.780
Angel, you're number one.

01:50:28.780 --> 01:50:32.220
You don't have one yet. Oh, sorry. Loki, you're number one.

01:50:32.220 --> 01:50:35.080
Oh, man. Um...

01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:40.160
Let's see. What would be a good game?

01:50:40.160 --> 01:50:41.860
I know, I know, I know.

01:50:41.860 --> 01:50:46.280
Well, let's... No, actually, that's gonna suck. Um...

01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:47.560
You know what?

01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:48.540

01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:10.560
it's not about leveling your fucking character it's about getting a god damn job

01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:12.560

01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:15.560

That's why they'll put it out on Xbox.

01:52:18.600 --> 01:52:24.560
And, Angel, for those that may not know, what is Happy Bunny?

01:52:24.560 --> 01:52:25.560
What is Happy Bunny?

01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:26.560
My personal avatar.

01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:30.360
Let Jamie do it, cause Jamie's cooler.

01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:31.360
Jamie?

01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:35.880
Um, I believe that my favorite Happy Bunny line is this cute little bunny, you see, that's

01:52:35.880 --> 01:52:38.600
looking all happy, all sweet, and everything.

01:52:38.600 --> 01:52:43.800
My favorite one is, school prepares you for the real world, which also sucks.

01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:48.680
you know my other favorite one is you icky people are nice but you gotta go

01:52:48.680 --> 01:52:53.240

little bit happy bunny still cool all right all right and the last one is my

01:52:59.320 --> 01:53:03.920
number one pick and it's very similar to one that Loki put in earlier but I had a

01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:08.360
different idea you guys know the guy game right well we need a game that

01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:12.680
caters to the other percentage of the male population the gay guy game and

01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:18.040

Now it's time for the elimination round.

01:53:21.960 --> 01:53:26.520

one song forever off of this list. Here we go. We have...

01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:34.880
Not a song. What? Not a song.

01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:38.240
No, you're right. It's not a song. It's an item from the list. Here we go.

01:53:38.240 --> 01:53:42.120
Number one. I'm sorry, not number one, but

01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:45.400

Alright, Jamie, you get the first elimination. What's coming off the list?

01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:21.480
Umm...

01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:26.240
I think that I'm going to have to kick

01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:29.960
off...

01:54:29.960 --> 01:54:33.440
Goddamn.

01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:36.320
Get off your ass and get a fucking job at the game. Really?

01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:39.760
Oh, I would have thought this would have been your anthem.

01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:45.600
defeating the purpose. You could play about getting a fucking job, you could go get a

01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:53.920
fucking job. Alright. So, yeah, defeat the purpose. Alright. Loki! Um, I'm gonna have

01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:58.600
to take off, uh, Ragnarok Online, the console game, cause that game sucks, and doesn't deserve

01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:03.240
to be on console. It's made by Koreans, there's, you know... Well, the same can be said about

01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:09.240
Final Fantasy XI, which also sucks. Yeah, but that's on a console already. D'oh! Yeah,

01:55:09.240 --> 01:55:15.240
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight. Ooh, take it outside, let's put it on webcam. Kick the shit out of each other.

01:58:13.060 --> 01:58:17.060
I should never fail to make some change

01:58:17.060 --> 01:58:20.060
But not so late, a thousand years since I was raised

01:58:20.060 --> 01:58:24.060
To emulate the storm in the middle of the dark

01:58:24.060 --> 01:58:28.060
And I'm raised up for love, love

01:58:28.060 --> 01:58:31.060
Love, love, love

01:58:31.060 --> 01:58:33.060
Simply being loved

01:58:33.060 --> 01:58:35.060
Love, love

01:58:35.060 --> 01:58:38.060
Simply being loved, loved, loved

01:58:38.060 --> 01:58:42.060
Simply being loved, loved, loved

01:58:42.060 --> 01:58:43.980
It seems they being loved...

01:58:44.220 --> 01:58:45.100
Loved, loved

01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:47.000
More than enough

01:58:46.980 --> 01:58:48.240
Yeah yeah

01:58:49.180 --> 01:58:50.800
Seems they being loved

Yeah

01:58:58.760 --> 01:58:59.420
Yeah

01:59:01.420 --> 01:59:02.680
Since they being loved

01:59:02.660 --> 01:59:03.300
Yeah

01:59:07.140 --> 01:59:08.500
Seems they being loved

01:59:08.500 --> 01:59:15.500
It's more than enough Simply being loved

01:59:15.500 --> 01:59:23.500
It's more than enough Simply being loved

01:59:23.500 --> 01:59:27.500
Is more than enough, yeah

02:01:23.500 --> 02:01:27.500
...

02:01:27.500 --> 02:01:31.500
...

02:01:31.500 --> 02:01:35.500
...

02:01:35.500 --> 02:01:39.500
...

02:01:39.500 --> 02:01:43.500
...

02:01:43.500 --> 02:01:47.500
...

02:01:47.500 --> 02:01:51.500
...

02:02:21.500 --> 02:02:45.060
Wow, he's quite a personality.

02:02:51.500 --> 02:03:09.500
Close your eyes, close your eyes and let us fly You and I, together we can touch the sky

02:03:09.500 --> 02:03:13.500
I was walking down the street

02:03:13.500 --> 02:03:16.500
You came like a summer breeze

02:03:16.500 --> 02:03:20.500
Sweeping my breath away

02:03:20.500 --> 02:03:23.500
It doesn't happen every day

02:03:23.500 --> 02:03:27.500
You and I together in the sky

02:03:27.500 --> 02:03:30.500
Forever young we can never die

02:03:30.500 --> 02:03:36.500
Close your eyes and let us fly

02:03:36.500 --> 02:03:39.500
You and I

02:03:39.500 --> 02:03:43.500
Together we can touch the sky

02:03:43.500 --> 02:03:46.500
Close your eyes

02:03:57.500 --> 02:04:01.500
Close your eyes

02:04:01.500 --> 02:04:04.500

You and I, you and I, together we can touch the sky.

02:04:41.500 --> 02:04:46.500
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting

02:04:46.500 --> 02:04:51.500
as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:04:51.500 --> 02:04:57.000
Um, Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bamani Music and More program. Can we talk about that?

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.500
No subject will ever be taboo.

02:04:59.500 --> 02:05:03.500
Well, I was thinking maybe we should move, pump up the volume from Tuesday nights?

02:05:03.500 --> 02:05:06.500
Except, of course, the subject that was just under discussion.

02:05:06.500 --> 02:05:12.500
Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

02:05:12.500 --> 02:05:14.500
I collect your fucking head.

02:05:15.500 --> 02:05:17.500
Just like this fucker here.

02:05:17.500 --> 02:05:26.500
Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki? The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

02:05:26.500 --> 02:05:34.500
Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

02:05:34.500 --> 02:05:42.500
Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

02:05:42.500 --> 02:05:47.380
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio and we're about ready to reveal the winners of

02:05:47.380 --> 02:05:52.660
tonight's list list, the definitive list of games we most want to see in 2005. It's very

02:05:52.660 --> 02:05:57.260
funny though because the chat room was just going off on these ideas about Orange Lounge

02:05:57.260 --> 02:06:02.740
Radio the game. Phoenix in the chat room says, Orange Lounge Radio the game, you could be

02:06:02.740 --> 02:06:07.180
one of the broadcasters and then if Loki says something retarded or votes for a bad song,

02:06:07.180 --> 02:06:13.700
You would probably be shot with an RPG or a large rifle, failure to do so will cause

02:06:13.700 --> 02:06:14.700
you to lose.

02:06:14.700 --> 02:06:17.300
Hey, I like that idea.

02:06:17.300 --> 02:06:19.060
And let's see, what else is it?

02:06:19.060 --> 02:06:23.820
Jaded2005 says, make it an RPG where you guide the Orange Lawns Radio guys to the studio

02:06:23.820 --> 02:06:25.380
before the show starts.

02:06:25.380 --> 02:06:28.220
K-Dash says, make sure they get there before 6.

02:06:28.220 --> 02:06:29.220
Ha!

02:06:29.220 --> 02:06:33.660
More like real life, make it before they get here by 6.32 because that's about what time

02:06:33.660 --> 02:06:35.540
they usually get here.

02:06:35.540 --> 02:06:52.540
BlackDevilerX says, OrangeOnsRadio the game definitely belongs on the Playstation 2. Yes, so we can be badly anti-aliased just like all the rest of the games on PS2, that'd be great. We could look very pixelated on the edges, be hot. Can't wait.

02:06:52.540 --> 02:06:55.540
DarkSakura, what do you think of OrangeOnsRadio the game?

02:06:55.540 --> 02:06:56.540
What do you think of wedding kimonos?

02:06:56.540 --> 02:06:58.540
I don't care, get with the show!

02:06:58.540 --> 02:07:05.540
Um, I think that I would have to go around with hammers hitting people in the head with them in the game.

02:07:05.540 --> 02:07:12.540
Love you. Okay, you can go back to the wedding talk now. Girl talk. With the silent Nelly. Angel?

02:07:12.540 --> 02:07:20.540
Does that mean I can kill everybody with halos? Oops, did I say that? And stuff. Yeah, I'm not funny. Okay, bye.

02:07:20.540 --> 02:07:27.540
Alright, let's get into tonight's winners from Listless.

02:07:27.540 --> 02:07:41.540
Alright, and now it's time to reveal the top three games we most want to see in 2005.

02:07:41.540 --> 02:07:46.540
Number three, Kid Icarus 2005.

02:07:46.540 --> 02:07:58.100
number two happy bunny kills everything and the number one game we most want to

02:07:58.100 --> 02:08:06.460

02:09:09.960 --> 02:09:10.960
It's El Mullet again.

02:09:10.960 --> 02:09:11.960
Hello, El Mullet!

02:09:11.960 --> 02:09:12.960
How are you, my friend?

02:09:12.960 --> 02:09:14.720
I am doing good, Sky.

02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:15.720
How about yourself?

02:09:15.720 --> 02:09:16.720
Good.

02:09:16.720 --> 02:09:17.720
Long time no talk?

02:09:17.720 --> 02:09:18.720
Yeah, long time no listen.

02:09:18.720 --> 02:09:21.080
I've just got...

02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:23.800
As with most people, it's all right.

02:09:23.800 --> 02:09:26.800
I take my sabbaticals from things every now and then.

02:09:26.800 --> 02:09:27.800
It's okay.

02:09:27.800 --> 02:09:28.800
It's all right.

02:09:28.800 --> 02:09:30.880
Well, what's new in the El Mullet world?

02:09:30.880 --> 02:09:36.200
Well, in the El Mullet world, I've recently restarted Encore Extra Stage.

02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:39.320
You will be receiving your weekly plug, as always.

02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:42.940
and I've been I've actually

02:09:42.940 --> 02:09:46.740
gone a bit mainstream I can't stop playing Grand Theft Auto 3

02:09:46.740 --> 02:09:51.400
I mean San Andreas for some reason. Because you like the n-word because

02:09:51.400 --> 02:09:53.840
that's about the only reason I can see to keep playing that game

02:09:53.840 --> 02:09:58.120
No, I'm kidding. Yes, the n-word is funny. I can't quote half the game.

02:09:58.120 --> 02:10:03.520
Alright. Loki, you were playing San Andreas for a while but you stopped. What happened, Loki?

02:10:03.520 --> 02:10:07.000
Oh, fancy. Exactly.

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:14.000
In all seriousness, what is it about San Andreas that's drawing you to that game?

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
I really don't know what it is.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:20.000
I mean, for some reason, I like the Grand Theft Auto formula.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
I like the basic gameplay about it.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:27.000
And this one actually has a good story that goes along with it.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
It's a very compelling one.

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:34.000
It relies mostly on gang warfare than mob warfare.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:38.560
and the story is pretty well done you know what I like about the Grand Theft

02:10:38.560 --> 02:10:41.160
Auto games is the fact that you can kinda just go around

02:10:41.160 --> 02:10:45.400
anywhere and do anything you don't really have to go and follow on the

02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:46.480
story if you want

02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:50.640
I mean sure it'll open up new areas new stuff but hell put in the cheat codes

02:10:50.640 --> 02:10:53.520
you can do whatever the hell you want and you can start blown away people with

02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:55.280
rockets and start running from the police

02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:58.800
that's my favorite part of the game is running away from the police

02:10:58.800 --> 02:11:03.320
me personally so what did you think of the list there that we came up with

02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:08.320
I liked it. I liked the list. Kid Icarus made it on there.

02:11:08.320 --> 02:11:11.320
Any particular game you think should have been on the list that wasn't?

02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:16.320
Can't really think of any one specifically.

02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:24.320
Alright. I had Beatmania 2DX USA on there because I do think that they should come out with the 2DX USA.

02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:36.320
Truthfully, it looks as though an American release of a 2DX or something along those lines is a bit more realized than it would be, say, like a year ago,

02:11:36.320 --> 02:11:42.320
because all of a sudden we see all these music games coming out in the U.S. with their various controllers.

02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:52.320
We have a Donkey Konga, we have Taiko and Otatsujin, and it seems as though if these things are really taking off,

02:11:52.320 --> 02:11:57.600
of Konami more incentive to look into porting some of their other Bimani over here?

02:11:57.600 --> 02:12:01.320
I hope so. I hope it's being incentive for them. I guess we'll find out. I'm hoping that

02:12:01.320 --> 02:12:05.200
we're in for a treat at E3 this year, but I'm not going to hold my breath either. I'm

02:12:05.200 --> 02:12:10.860
expecting to see Karaoke Revolution 4, Extreme 2, and Ultramix 3, which honestly wouldn't

02:12:10.860 --> 02:12:15.380
be a bad lineup, don't get me wrong. I mean, they have to do an Ultramix 3. Have to. No

02:12:15.380 --> 02:12:17.840
choice. As far as I'm concerned.

02:12:17.840 --> 02:12:20.080
Ultramix 2 is the best, do you?

02:12:20.080 --> 02:12:25.100
I highly agree. So you were mentioning your column which is Encore Extra Stage. I will

02:12:25.100 --> 02:12:29.600
give you a chance to plug it since you plug us so kindly in your column. Let the listeners

02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:37.160
know where they can read your column. Go to www.insidepulse.com or to go directly

02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:46.960
to my section, games.insidepulse.com. I have a Friday column, Encore Extra Stage. It's

02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:51.880
It's numbered and everything, and it's a pretty good read.

02:12:51.880 --> 02:12:52.880
Pretty good read indeed.

02:12:52.880 --> 02:12:53.880
It's a mediocre read.

02:12:53.880 --> 02:12:54.880
No, I'm kidding.

02:12:54.880 --> 02:12:55.880
It's a very good read.

02:12:55.880 --> 02:12:56.880
It's good.

02:12:56.880 --> 02:12:57.880
Thank you, Sky.

02:12:57.880 --> 02:12:58.880
It does compliment you.

02:12:58.880 --> 02:12:59.880
Any time.

02:12:59.880 --> 02:13:00.880
Any time.

02:13:00.880 --> 02:13:01.880
It's okay.

02:13:01.880 --> 02:13:05.200
I mean, I guess if I'm done looking at porn, it's something I can go look at, you know,

02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:06.200
while I'm kind of coming down.

02:13:06.200 --> 02:13:09.920
That's the majority of my fan base, some stick-a-fingered porn watchers.

02:13:09.920 --> 02:13:12.400
Hey, same thing.

02:13:12.400 --> 02:13:13.400
Hey, you know what?

02:13:13.400 --> 02:13:19.100
people that listen to this show while looking at porn, so, you know?

02:13:19.100 --> 02:13:22.020
I don't know how people could listen to this show while looking at porn, because I think

02:13:22.020 --> 02:13:23.340
listening to this show would just be...

02:13:23.340 --> 02:13:34.340
I can just see them, all of a sudden, Moki's face appearing on a girl's body, ugh.

02:13:34.340 --> 02:13:37.260
Alright, what else was I going to say?

02:13:37.260 --> 02:13:40.260
Over on Inside Pulse, you guys do a lot of game reviews, right?

02:13:40.260 --> 02:13:42.300
Not just you, but the other folks over there, right?

02:13:42.300 --> 02:13:43.380
Oh yeah.

02:13:43.380 --> 02:13:48.060
And so, did you guys do any sort of top 2004 list?

02:13:48.060 --> 02:13:50.900
We did a 2004 awards segment, actually.

02:13:50.900 --> 02:13:55.420
And what was the best game of 2004?

02:13:55.420 --> 02:14:04.340
Best game of 2004, give me a second, let me look it up, it's been a tiny bit since I started.

02:14:04.340 --> 02:14:07.260
How about you personally, while you're looking?

02:14:07.260 --> 02:14:13.220
Me personally, I guess it would be a tie in between Katamari Damacy and Pokemon FireRed

02:14:13.220 --> 02:14:14.220
LeafGreen.

02:14:14.220 --> 02:14:15.220
Really?

02:14:15.220 --> 02:14:17.060
You liked Pokemon that much, huh?

02:14:17.060 --> 02:14:19.100
I'm a Pokemon fan.

02:14:19.100 --> 02:14:23.880
To be brutally honest with you, I've been a fan since the Red-Blue days.

02:14:23.880 --> 02:14:27.740
It's a very engrossing game.

02:14:27.740 --> 02:14:32.540
I love the fact that it's freeform after you go through all the main quests.

02:14:32.540 --> 02:14:36.980
I thought it was good, but I don't know if I could name it best in 2004, but to each

02:14:36.980 --> 02:14:38.980
To each their own. To each their own.

02:14:38.980 --> 02:14:39.980
Loki.

02:14:39.980 --> 02:14:41.980
I have my nomination for best of 2004.

02:14:41.980 --> 02:14:43.980
Actually, I guess it would be kind of best of 2005.

02:14:43.980 --> 02:14:45.980
But start in 2004.

02:14:45.980 --> 02:14:50.980
It would be Gary's Mod, version 5 for Half-Life 2.

02:14:50.980 --> 02:14:52.980
Why? Why?

02:14:52.980 --> 02:14:55.980
Because you can pose people and make funny pictures.

02:14:55.980 --> 02:14:57.980
For instance, they have...

02:14:57.980 --> 02:15:02.980
And you can find this all at www.gary.tv slash Gary's Mod.

02:15:02.980 --> 02:15:04.980
Oh, the one with the baby launcher.

02:15:04.980 --> 02:15:10.980
Yes, exactly. It says you can string up a Combine soldier and fire dead babies at him.

02:15:10.980 --> 02:15:18.980
And there's the dead babies. And there's also one that says position rag dolls so they look like they've had a baby.

02:15:18.980 --> 02:15:24.980
It's just so much fun. This is like, this is what we need.

02:15:24.980 --> 02:15:28.980
Only you would vote for the game with the dead baby launcher.

02:15:28.980 --> 02:15:31.980
I'd vote for the game with the dead baby launcher. That's pretty cool.

02:15:31.980 --> 02:15:33.980
Post that link in our chat if you can.

02:15:33.980 --> 02:15:35.980
Alright, alright, alright.

02:15:35.980 --> 02:15:37.980
I'm sorry Mullet, we forgot all about you.

02:15:37.980 --> 02:15:41.980
And that game that you guys were looking at there?

02:15:41.980 --> 02:15:44.980
Best of 2004 according to the Inside Pulse folks.

02:15:44.980 --> 02:15:46.980
Inside Pulse it was Katamari Damacy.

02:15:46.980 --> 02:15:48.980
I'm not surprised.

02:15:48.980 --> 02:15:51.980
With GTA SA following up his runner up.

02:15:51.980 --> 02:15:53.980
I'm also not surprised.

02:15:53.980 --> 02:15:56.980
Now wait, I'm kind of surprised that Halo 2 isn't mentioned there somewhere,

02:15:56.980 --> 02:16:00.980
but you're a very anti-Halo kind of guy if I remember right, right?

02:16:00.980 --> 02:16:04.980
Yeah, mostly because of the fucking hype.

02:16:04.980 --> 02:16:06.980
The hype killed the game.

02:16:06.980 --> 02:16:08.980
It was a lot of hype. You know what's funny though?

02:16:08.980 --> 02:16:14.980
You and I think DDR Angel are the only people on my Xbox Live friends list that don't have the game.

02:16:14.980 --> 02:16:17.980
Or at least don't have a character registered.

02:16:17.980 --> 02:16:18.980
Wait, what?

02:16:18.980 --> 02:16:20.980
I don't get a logo that loads for you guys.

02:16:20.980 --> 02:16:22.980
Uh, Halo 2. You don't have it, right Angel?

02:16:22.980 --> 02:16:24.980
I don't have Halo 2 yet.

02:16:24.980 --> 02:16:25.980
Exactly.

02:16:25.980 --> 02:16:27.980
I don't even play it, but I have a character made for...

02:16:27.980 --> 02:16:31.980
I just think it's kind of interesting. What about the hype ruin the game?

02:16:31.980 --> 02:16:36.980
Just the fact that, you know, is the overnight people waiting out in line, or just the...

02:16:36.980 --> 02:16:44.980
Oh, not even that. We're talking about a year ago, it was named best game on the Xbox without anybody playing it.

02:16:44.980 --> 02:16:50.980
Yeah. You know, I'll tell you what bugged me about Halo 2 was the fact, I mean, I love Halo 2.

02:16:50.980 --> 02:16:55.980
It's an awesome game. Me personally, I love it. I do agree the hype was a little bit much.

02:16:55.980 --> 02:17:02.980
here's my biggest problem with Halo 2. It was Halo 1 with Xbox Live and a kind of better

02:17:02.980 --> 02:17:09.660
story mode, a more theatric story mode. No way, it had the flying things. But Halo 1

02:17:09.660 --> 02:17:13.700
had the warthog? But the flying things are cool because if you get the flying things

02:17:13.700 --> 02:17:17.540
into areas you're not supposed to have them, then you can run around on top of buildings

02:17:17.540 --> 02:17:22.620
and explore. While it had more, it didn't have that much more. That was my complaint.

02:17:22.620 --> 02:17:27.620
And, and, and, and, and, and. It had the, um, the, uh, Arbiter.

02:17:27.620 --> 02:17:29.620
With his Inviso armor.

02:17:29.620 --> 02:17:32.620
No, I don't want the Halo fans sending me a nasty gram going,

02:17:32.620 --> 02:17:36.620
You faggot! Why don't you like the Halo games? What is wrong with you?

02:17:36.620 --> 02:17:42.620
Okay, I bought Halo. I like Halo. Like! Like! I just don't love it.

02:17:42.620 --> 02:17:47.620
The Arbiter's level, though, is really aggravating, because you don't know who you're trying to kill.

02:17:47.620 --> 02:17:51.620
Because they're all freakin' Covenant guys.

02:17:51.620 --> 02:17:53.620
I know. It's confusing.

02:17:54.620 --> 02:17:56.620
And then I get motion sick.

02:17:56.620 --> 02:18:01.620
Any other thoughts, Mullet, on gaming? What's going on right now or anything in general?

02:18:01.620 --> 02:18:07.620
Well, actually, going on to, like, gaming cults and people emailing you going,

02:18:07.620 --> 02:18:10.620
You're an idiot if you don't like this, that, and the other thing.

02:18:10.620 --> 02:18:14.620
I got my first In The Groove fanboy email.

02:18:14.620 --> 02:18:17.620
Ooh, goodie! I haven't gotten any of those yet.

02:18:17.620 --> 02:18:20.620
Rob at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:18:20.620 --> 02:18:25.820
In The Groove is not that great. Send your emails away, okay? There you go. I said it.

02:18:25.820 --> 02:18:32.220
I personally can't comment on the game because there is no machine within the 500 mile radius of my house.

02:18:32.220 --> 02:18:32.720
Yikes.

02:18:32.720 --> 02:18:41.020
But the guy emails my cookie column, which I wrote five months ago, and takes it completely out of context.

02:18:41.020 --> 02:18:47.820
Oh boy, you think they'd put in Moonlight Shadow because of your suggestion? You are selfish. In The Groove rocks.

02:18:47.820 --> 02:18:52.060
Are you going to respond to it in your next column?

02:18:52.060 --> 02:18:56.820
I've already responded it to him and I'm gonna print it like up front and center in the

02:18:56.820 --> 02:18:58.060
next column pretty much.

02:18:58.060 --> 02:19:03.380
Can't wait! Can't wait. Silly fanboys.

02:19:03.380 --> 02:19:06.460
Alright, but if you do want to send fanboy or fangirl mail to

02:19:06.460 --> 02:19:09.820
Orange Lawns Radio, you can send it to either Rob at Orange Lawns Radio,

02:19:09.820 --> 02:19:13.540
Jamie at Orange Lawns Radio, or Loki at Orange Lawns Radio. We all have

02:19:13.540 --> 02:19:16.900
those addresses, so have fun. Alright.

02:19:16.900 --> 02:19:19.900
Anything else you want to share, El Mullet, before I hang up on you?

02:19:19.900 --> 02:19:21.900
I can go ahead and hang up now, no big deal.

02:19:21.900 --> 02:19:23.900
All right. Have a good one, Mullet. Thanks for calling.

02:19:23.900 --> 02:19:24.900
Good.

02:19:24.900 --> 02:19:28.900
I cut him off. I'm so rude. I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.

02:19:28.900 --> 02:19:32.900
All right, we're going to keep the Skype line open if anybody else wants to call in.

02:19:32.900 --> 02:19:35.900
I had, as much as we enjoy El Mullet and talking to him on the show,

02:19:35.900 --> 02:19:38.900
I had to let him go because I wanted to see if anybody else wanted to call.

02:19:38.900 --> 02:19:40.900
I got to give other folks an opportunity here.

02:19:40.900 --> 02:19:44.900
What are you looking at now? You're still on this Gary's Mod thing for Half-Life 2,

02:19:44.900 --> 02:19:50.180
Life 2. Which, by the way, is a game I really want to play. I just haven't. I'm just, I

02:19:50.180 --> 02:19:58.140
don't know. Loki. I'm working on acquiring it. I have my means. Anyways, the other thing

02:19:58.140 --> 02:20:04.980
that I should note that was posted, Jason, you know, in our chat room there, he posted

02:20:04.980 --> 02:20:12.340
a link to a port for Duke Nukem 3D for Windows. That's pretty sweet. But this Garry's Mod

02:20:12.340 --> 02:20:16.700
things so cool because just people like make the weirdest things out of this like

02:20:16.700 --> 02:20:22.300
they have one with a pole dancer which is great I don't even know why it's just so

02:20:22.300 --> 02:20:26.780
funny or this one it's like look ma no hands is some guy riding the bike then

02:20:26.780 --> 02:20:31.500
all of a sudden it's just like smack into a tree I mean just like funny shit but

02:20:31.500 --> 02:20:34.740
this is the best part about it is you can make like your own webcomics just

02:20:34.740 --> 02:20:40.980
doing little screen captures and putting stuff on there it's genius it's fun you

02:20:40.980 --> 02:20:45.040
You know, it kind of reminds me of Duke Nukem 3D when you could make your own maps and you

02:20:45.040 --> 02:20:48.720
could just have like the strippers out in the middle of the street just doing nothing

02:20:48.720 --> 02:20:54.020
but just sitting there on the poles and you can blow them all away with rocket launches.

02:20:54.020 --> 02:20:57.200
I've made some of the most kick-ass Duke Nukem 3D maps ever.

02:20:57.200 --> 02:21:03.920
I'd spent like months on these maps and then like literally I'd run out of space because

02:21:03.920 --> 02:21:09.200
in the build engine, which is the whole engine based around Duke Nukem 3D, you're given like

02:21:09.200 --> 02:21:12.920
a limited amount of map that you can basically build in and I would

02:21:12.920 --> 02:21:17.640
literally fill up everything just completely fill it up all right we're

02:21:17.640 --> 02:21:19.880
gonna go back to the skyline cuz we actually got a phone call wait Jamie you

02:21:19.880 --> 02:21:23.600
have a quick comment for you I'm just actually having a flashback to on

02:21:23.600 --> 02:21:29.120
emulators the Metroid level builder oh a guy built his own version of Metroid

02:21:29.120 --> 02:21:33.840
Metroid and the Zelda one too great so man people got too much free time get

02:21:33.840 --> 02:21:37.240
out and get a job get a real huh all right all right I gotta go to the

02:21:37.240 --> 02:21:42.680
collar cuz he's hanging here hi you're on orange lounge radio hey hey big red

02:21:42.680 --> 02:21:49.840
pimp what's up what's on your mind I'm just thinking about all that first

02:21:49.840 --> 02:21:53.080
person shooter crap you guys are talking over there all right what about the

02:21:53.080 --> 02:21:57.880
first person shooter crap I think they that first person shooter players just

02:21:57.880 --> 02:22:03.120
rank up there with people who post on forums there's scourge of the earth now

02:22:03.120 --> 02:22:06.680
wait a minute you need to tell me there is not a single first-person shooter

02:22:06.680 --> 02:22:13.000
game that you kind of like? I have not played a first person shooter that I have liked since

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:16.820
GoldenEye. Since GoldenEye. So at least there's one, okay? Yeah. And there's not a single

02:22:16.820 --> 02:22:24.000
web forum out there you like either? No. After reading game facts, forget it. Okay, well

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:29.680
that I could go with. But, not even OrangeLawnsRadio.com forums? You make me sad. I don't, I'm not

02:22:29.680 --> 02:22:33.600
much of a forum whore. Alright, well what do you do on the internet then? Because as

02:22:33.600 --> 02:22:39.400
As far as I know, the internet is all about forum horror, live journal, and chat rooms

02:22:39.400 --> 02:22:41.440
pretending to be people you're not.

02:22:41.440 --> 02:22:43.720
You're forgetting the porn junkies, too.

02:22:43.720 --> 02:22:44.720
Oh!

02:22:44.720 --> 02:22:45.720
Shit!

02:22:45.720 --> 02:22:46.720
How could I forget the porn junkies?

02:22:46.720 --> 02:22:47.720
Alright.

02:22:47.720 --> 02:22:52.040
So you, instead of posting on forums, you have amassed a collection of pornography?

02:22:52.040 --> 02:22:53.040
No.

02:22:53.040 --> 02:22:54.040
Oh.

02:22:54.040 --> 02:22:55.040
No.

02:22:55.040 --> 02:22:56.040
C'mon, Mikey, no.

02:22:56.040 --> 02:22:57.040
I don't want...

02:22:57.040 --> 02:22:58.040
What?

02:22:58.040 --> 02:22:59.380
Well, then what is it you do on the internet?

02:22:59.380 --> 02:23:00.380
Make fun of others.

02:23:00.380 --> 02:23:01.380
Oh, okay.

02:23:01.380 --> 02:23:05.380
That's pretty much the same thing as what forum posters do. Very similar.

02:23:05.380 --> 02:23:07.380
Cousins. I don't know.

02:23:07.380 --> 02:23:10.380
I have nothing better to do than rant anyway.

02:23:10.380 --> 02:23:14.380
Alright. Well, ranting is for live journals. You should get one of those, uh...

02:23:14.380 --> 02:23:18.380
I don't know, what? Live journal, or what are the other things? Zangas, or...

02:23:18.380 --> 02:23:20.380
I don't know what the hell else there is. Blogger.

02:23:20.380 --> 02:23:22.380
I rant enough in my live journal.

02:23:22.380 --> 02:23:25.380
Oh, so you do have a live journal. So there you go. There's something for the internet.

02:23:25.380 --> 02:23:27.380
Alright.

02:23:27.380 --> 02:23:33.380
Alright, anything else you want to share with us, Big Red Pimp, before we hang up on you? Anything you want to plug?

02:23:33.380 --> 02:23:42.380
Not really, except for the fact that Loki, the song should not be referenced as girls, because girls do not suck that badly, and I'm going to end it as that.

02:23:42.380 --> 02:23:46.380
Loki is actually not in the room right now, but we'll relay the message to him.

02:23:46.380 --> 02:23:47.380
Okay.

02:23:47.380 --> 02:23:48.380
Alright, have a good one.

02:23:48.380 --> 02:23:49.380
You too.

02:23:49.380 --> 02:23:50.380
Bye.

02:23:50.380 --> 02:23:53.380
Actually, I hope you heard it from the other room. That would be hilarious.

02:23:53.380 --> 02:23:59.380
Okay, we'll keep the Skype line open for one more call, maybe, possibly. We'll see.

02:23:59.380 --> 02:24:03.380
We'll see what happens there.

02:24:03.380 --> 02:24:06.380
I'm just reading our chat room, some random folks there.

02:24:06.380 --> 02:24:09.380
www.orangeandre.com, click on chat.

02:24:09.380 --> 02:24:15.380
Jaded2005 says, first-person shooters are too much for me. People play that for like 15 hours straight.

02:24:15.380 --> 02:24:17.380
I have seen people that play that stuff for 15 hours straight.

02:24:17.380 --> 02:24:22.820
Me personally, I can play it a little bit. I like playing my friends, maybe in an hour-long

02:24:22.820 --> 02:24:26.220
session on a weekend, but that's about it. I can't stand much more than that.

02:24:26.220 --> 02:24:29.780
Alright, we're getting another call. Let's go back to the Skype line and say, hi, you're

02:24:29.780 --> 02:24:30.780
on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:24:30.780 --> 02:24:31.780
Hey, it's Misty.

02:24:31.780 --> 02:24:32.780
Hi, Misty, how are you?

02:24:32.780 --> 02:24:33.780
Hi, Misty. Doing good.

02:24:33.780 --> 02:24:34.780
Aw, what's on your mind, Misty?

02:24:34.780 --> 02:24:43.980
I just really wanted to say not all the torrents are porn.

02:24:43.980 --> 02:24:50.280
I know not all the torrents out there are porn, but a good majority.

02:24:50.280 --> 02:24:56.060
What kind of torrents do you like to download then, if it's not porn?

02:24:56.060 --> 02:24:58.420
My main downloads are anime, of course.

02:24:58.420 --> 02:25:01.980
I haven't been much in a torrent mode right now.

02:25:01.980 --> 02:25:05.860
I know it's kind of, ever since Supernova went down it's been kind of hard to stay on

02:25:05.860 --> 02:25:06.860
top of torrents.

02:25:06.860 --> 02:25:11.900
I know that one thing I'm going to end up torrenting is probably the new season of 24,

02:25:11.900 --> 02:25:14.500
which was on tonight and I completely forgot about it, so I'm going to have to download

02:25:14.500 --> 02:25:15.500
the first episode.

02:25:15.500 --> 02:25:20.460
It's not really into 24 yet.

02:25:20.460 --> 02:25:21.620
I think it's a good show.

02:25:21.620 --> 02:25:24.260
I kind of missed most of last season, but I think it's a good show.

02:25:24.260 --> 02:25:26.020
What kind of anime do you download?

02:25:26.020 --> 02:25:30.300
What kind of anime is good stuff out there right now on Torrid?

02:25:30.300 --> 02:25:33.820
Last major thing I downloaded is the series called Psychic Academy.

02:25:33.820 --> 02:25:39.620
It doesn't seem likely to get released in the US from what I've seen of the series.

02:25:39.620 --> 02:25:41.620
Yeah, Loki, you coming?

02:25:41.620 --> 02:25:45.620
No, I just wanted to hold the microphone.

02:25:45.620 --> 02:25:48.620
Well, I thought maybe you had a question for Misty or something.

02:25:48.620 --> 02:25:51.620
Anything you want to plug, Misty, while you're here on the air?

02:25:51.620 --> 02:25:54.620
Don't really have anything to plug.

02:25:54.620 --> 02:25:56.620
All right, well, fair enough. We just-

02:25:56.620 --> 02:25:58.620
Download the Parappa anime.

02:25:58.620 --> 02:25:59.620
Is that on?

02:25:59.620 --> 02:26:03.620
I found it on anime-suki.com.

02:26:03.620 --> 02:26:06.620
All right, download the Parappa torrent. You gotta let us know what you think.

02:26:06.620 --> 02:26:07.620
All right, I will.

02:26:07.620 --> 02:26:14.620
Alright. Hey, uhh, video game you're most looking forward to seeing in 2005?

02:26:14.620 --> 02:26:16.620
Anything?

02:26:16.620 --> 02:26:20.620
Uh, nothing I can really think of right now, but I haven't been paying much attention.

02:26:20.620 --> 02:26:24.620
That's alright, it's hard to pay attention to this show sometimes.

02:26:24.620 --> 02:26:28.620
I'm just messing with you. Thanks for calling in, Misty, you have a wonderful week.

02:26:28.620 --> 02:26:30.620
You too. Bye-bye.

02:26:30.620 --> 02:26:35.620
I like Misty, she's so sweet. She's always there for the show, she's always there in chat to say

02:26:35.620 --> 02:26:38.420
to say when newbies come in throughout the week going,

02:26:38.420 --> 02:26:40.620
is this Orange Louse Radio's chat room?

02:26:40.620 --> 02:26:43.620
Misty's always there to say something hello or say, if she's around, she'll say,

02:26:43.620 --> 02:26:45.620
No, you dumb shits, this is DDR.

02:26:45.620 --> 02:26:50.620
That's what I'm going to say to the next one, no, you dumb shits, this is DDR Freak.

02:26:50.620 --> 02:26:57.620
Although, ironically enough, this show's going to be played on DDR Freak Radio, so for some, anyway.

02:26:57.620 --> 02:27:00.620
It's the Bimani Sims chat room.

02:27:00.620 --> 02:27:04.620
This is Bimani style chat, actually.

02:27:04.620 --> 02:27:06.620
Pimp my dance pad.

02:27:06.620 --> 02:27:10.620
Yes, this is Pimp My Dance Pad, exactly.

02:27:10.620 --> 02:27:13.620
Oh, boy. All right.

02:27:13.620 --> 02:27:18.620
That's it for the Skype line for now. We might open it up again a little bit later there, but I think three is enough for now.

02:27:18.620 --> 02:27:23.620
We're going to go to a break, and when we come back from this break, we've got to get ranty.

02:27:23.620 --> 02:27:26.620
We're upset, and we're going to get ranty.

02:27:26.620 --> 02:27:30.620
In this break, we're going to feature some Superstar.

02:27:30.620 --> 02:27:37.180
I wanted to hear, oh no wait, no. We're not gonna hear Superstar. We're gonna hear Ussama Kabota songs, because I promised Jamie we could hear some.

02:27:37.180 --> 02:27:38.400
Ahh...

02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:40.860
I'm sorry, I almost forgot there for a minute, so um...

02:27:40.860 --> 02:27:43.780
Cause I will like go postal if I don't hear Presto.

02:27:43.780 --> 02:27:47.600
Alright, we're gonna cue that up so Jamie does not go postal.

02:27:47.600 --> 02:27:50.660
She has so many reasons to go postal though, honestly.

02:27:50.660 --> 02:27:55.340
Alright, we'll start it off with Presto, Ussama Kabota music.

02:27:55.340 --> 02:27:59.140
We'll be back with the FUs of the week, which you can send in by the way

02:27:59.140 --> 02:28:02.300
right now over private message to Sky if you have something you want to say

02:28:02.300 --> 02:28:04.300
after this.

02:33:32.300 --> 02:33:34.300
La di ba

02:33:46.600 --> 02:33:52.660
Oi oi, mi nou, mi bais, oi, oi, mi nou

02:33:52.660 --> 02:33:58.660
Ba da di nou, mi bais, oi, oi, mi nou

02:33:58.660 --> 02:34:14.740
Happy, happy, w-w-w-w-w-w-w Happy, happy, happy, w-w-w-w-wah

02:34:23.480 --> 02:34:28.000
Orange Lounge radio, we put your thang down. Flip it and reverse it.

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.500
This server made a bit of a fight in the head, nubba.

02:34:30.500 --> 02:34:32.500
Hey sir, I've been made a bit of a fight and you ain't had none before.

02:35:00.500 --> 02:35:04.380
these FUs of the week, even though they often don't have anything to do with video games,

02:35:04.380 --> 02:35:06.180
why do we have to do this every single week?

02:35:06.180 --> 02:35:08.180
Grr, arg.

02:35:08.180 --> 02:35:12.380
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

02:35:12.380 --> 02:35:16.540
Let's, let's try that again.

02:35:16.540 --> 02:35:18.300
Why is it that we have to do these...

02:35:18.300 --> 02:35:21.460
Rob, you are a bitch.

02:35:21.460 --> 02:35:24.100
Minor technical glitch there.

02:35:24.100 --> 02:35:25.300
You are a bitch.

02:35:25.300 --> 02:35:29.660
I thought we could do Switcheroo Night or something and I'd give Loki the gay song or

02:35:29.660 --> 02:35:34.660
I'm just kidding. All right. No, you don't get girls. Um, I'm sorry. Let's try that from the top.

02:35:34.660 --> 02:35:37.660
Rewind. Start over. Take two.

02:35:37.660 --> 02:35:43.660
Jamie? Jamie? Why is it that we have to do these FUs of the week every single week?

02:35:43.660 --> 02:35:44.660
Fuck you.

02:35:46.660 --> 02:35:49.660
Um, my first FU wants to go to Rob.

02:35:49.660 --> 02:35:51.660
This is too serious for you.

02:35:51.660 --> 02:36:08.420
Um, no, my first F.U. of the night is, uh, just to the torrential downpour we had, um,

02:36:08.420 --> 02:36:09.420
it was pretty vicious.

02:36:09.420 --> 02:36:14.060
Another F.U. goes to the HR guy I was dealing with for basically trying to pull the same

02:36:14.060 --> 02:36:19.780
crap he pulled on one of my other co-workers, um, basically whenever we brought up a legitimate

02:36:19.780 --> 02:36:23.260
concern he was trying to fool the company this and I basically turned it right back

02:36:23.260 --> 02:36:27.460
around on him because if there's one thing I'm good at it's point-and-counter point.

02:36:27.460 --> 02:36:34.100
So finally I got him to say that he was going to turn over our VP to our business partner

02:36:34.100 --> 02:36:35.100
over here.

02:36:35.100 --> 02:36:37.860
So I'm going to have some investigation going on.

02:36:37.860 --> 02:36:44.780
Um, F.U. goes to the VP for always wanting to put his goddamn hand on my shoulder whenever

02:36:44.780 --> 02:36:45.780
he talks to me.

02:36:45.780 --> 02:36:50.620
like you know I should have just said you know I would rather you not do that

02:36:50.620 --> 02:36:56.460
but the whole thing is that this is a VP and until I report him to HR I don't

02:36:56.460 --> 02:37:03.620
know what's going to be used as a you know a retaliatory action because I

02:37:03.620 --> 02:37:09.660
think he's petty enough to do it so um yeah big etsy goes to him he keeps

02:37:09.660 --> 02:37:13.900
begging me to stay and then he on top of this he's trying to get me to stay there

02:37:13.900 --> 02:37:19.200
through the end of the month, forcing me to stay by some weird, we have to hold her to

02:37:19.200 --> 02:37:25.440
release her some type of bullshit. And my change date's already set with HR. He can't

02:37:25.440 --> 02:37:31.480
freakin' do it, so I get to rub it in his face Monday. That's gonna be awesome.

02:37:31.480 --> 02:37:37.460
Um, F.U. goes to, uh, you know, I really don't have much else to F.U. about except for maybe

02:37:37.460 --> 02:37:43.560
my lack of time. And also, um, an F.U. goes toward my lack of funds and ability to travel

02:37:43.560 --> 02:37:48.400
to places that I want to go and see people I want to see. Other than that, I'm fairly

02:37:48.400 --> 02:37:52.660
happy because I don't have to be there anymore after this week. I don't have to look at that

02:37:52.660 --> 02:37:59.660
man after this week. It's going to be so awesome. Yeah.

02:38:01.380 --> 02:38:03.460
She put the mic down, so I'm thinking she's done.

02:38:03.460 --> 02:38:04.060
Done.

02:38:04.060 --> 02:38:06.060
Loki, it's your turn.

02:38:34.060 --> 02:38:39.080
while you're partying I am going afk for a second and they're gone for half an

02:38:39.080 --> 02:38:44.880
hour now fuck that that's stupid if you have things that you know you have to do

02:38:44.880 --> 02:38:51.840
don't play the game get the set-aside time anyways so fuck you that fuck you

02:38:51.840 --> 02:38:58.120
to online websites that don't really correspond with you when you order

02:38:58.120 --> 02:39:03.440
product with them you just kind of have to wait and wait and wait and hope that

02:39:03.440 --> 02:39:13.400
they sent it and then just take your money and yeah pretty much all I have

02:39:13.400 --> 02:39:20.280
right now yep that's it I don't have anything else I can think of Anna by the

02:39:20.280 --> 02:39:22.280
by the way, suggesting a warp 2.

02:39:25.280 --> 02:39:28.280
What? Oh, oh yeah, we did do that.

02:39:31.280 --> 02:39:32.280
My turn.

02:39:39.280 --> 02:39:42.280
I would like to give a big fat F you to the rain.

02:39:43.280 --> 02:39:46.280
On Thursday night, the rain was so bad.

02:39:46.280 --> 02:39:50.960
bad like we here on the West Coast we're really big pussies when it comes to the

02:39:50.960 --> 02:39:51.760
rain okay

02:39:51.760 --> 02:39:54.920
if it starts are seriously like

02:39:54.920 --> 02:39:58.640
I've been on the East Coast and I've seen how it rains back there when it rains on

02:39:58.640 --> 02:39:59.840
the East Coast it rains

02:39:59.840 --> 02:40:03.040
when it rains like that here people freak out

02:40:03.040 --> 02:40:06.160
okay we have to remember it's not built

02:40:06.160 --> 02:40:10.040
around here to handle rain like that it's really not it rains like that out

02:40:10.040 --> 02:40:11.280
here too long it floods

02:40:11.280 --> 02:40:15.760
and I hate to interject on this but Rob you remember seeing me

02:40:15.760 --> 02:40:18.080
one of the first times I was out here for a big rain, right?

02:40:18.080 --> 02:40:22.600
I believe so. Me just going what the fuck at all to everybody else

02:40:22.600 --> 02:40:26.680
because it was nothing. But here's the problem.

02:40:26.680 --> 02:40:30.200
I don't have a problem with heavy rain like that. I have a problem when that

02:40:30.200 --> 02:40:31.120
heavy rain

02:40:31.120 --> 02:40:34.960
starts causing so much drainage to fall from the top of the roof and it's

02:40:34.960 --> 02:40:39.320
falling outside my window on the bush that it's keeping me awake and I can't

02:40:39.320 --> 02:40:40.360
freaking sleep.

02:40:40.360 --> 02:40:44.680
So I have to get up at 4.30 in the morning. No, 4 in the morning because I

02:40:44.680 --> 02:40:45.480
can't sleep

02:40:45.480 --> 02:40:50.480
And I get on the computer and read about freaking DDR and Mario.

02:40:50.480 --> 02:40:53.480
I just, I don't know.

02:40:53.480 --> 02:40:56.480
I was sad.

02:40:56.480 --> 02:40:59.480
That's it, so I give an FU to the rain.

02:40:59.480 --> 02:41:03.480
Otherwise, I really don't have a lot to be pissed off about.

02:41:03.480 --> 02:41:08.480
FU to people that, um, FU to slow service at restaurants. Oh my god.

02:41:08.480 --> 02:41:11.480
That was the slowest service the other day. It made me scream.

02:41:11.480 --> 02:41:13.480
I think that's it. I'm good otherwise.

02:41:13.480 --> 02:41:15.100
here from the original

02:41:15.100 --> 02:41:18.340
uh... defeated being sick earlier this week as i was afraid i was going to be

02:41:18.340 --> 02:41:19.420
a

02:41:19.420 --> 02:41:21.060
commission today but uh...

02:41:21.060 --> 02:41:23.100
i'm here to see a

02:41:23.100 --> 02:41:26.600
every people they can't run a party you're not supposed to

02:41:26.600 --> 02:41:30.760
have somebody that's four levels higher than you

02:41:30.760 --> 02:41:33.040
thank you and for stealing me away from that party

02:41:33.040 --> 02:41:34.480
good

02:41:34.480 --> 02:41:35.860
uh... yeah

02:41:35.860 --> 02:41:36.820
that's out

02:41:36.820 --> 02:41:37.920
and uh...

02:41:37.920 --> 02:41:40.120
and you know i think it's all my god

02:41:40.120 --> 02:41:40.940

02:41:43.020 --> 02:41:50.020
go sub job. Oh well, I'm almost done and I can go back to Black Mage, so yay. Okay, I'm done. See, I'm boring.

02:41:50.020 --> 02:41:55.020
Alright. I actually thought of one. Oh my god, Loki reminded me of one. I gotta go back.

02:41:55.020 --> 02:41:57.020
Okay, go back.

02:41:57.020 --> 02:41:59.020
Rewind.

02:41:59.020 --> 02:42:06.020
That's the theme of tonight, is rewind. Okay, here it is. We had a party yesterday in Final Fantasy XI.

02:42:06.020 --> 02:42:10.020
Jamie? We had a party yesterday in Final Fantasy XI.

02:42:10.020 --> 02:42:22.020
You know how in Final Fantasy XI you have Japanese and English players playing together? That's kind of the draw, you know, it's kind of cool.

02:42:22.020 --> 02:42:24.020
Sometimes you get to party. Yeah, I know, that's what I said.

02:42:24.020 --> 02:42:28.020
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Kevin Spacey is supposed to play Lex Luthor.

02:42:28.020 --> 02:42:33.020
Yes, he is. Anyway, my, hello, my segment, my time, my time.

02:42:33.020 --> 02:42:39.020
alright so anyway sometimes you get to party with Japanese people right

02:42:39.020 --> 02:42:42.100
well we have a Japanese person in our party

02:42:42.100 --> 02:42:45.260
and then we invite this paladin who is

02:42:45.260 --> 02:42:48.700
from the US and this is what she says and I quote when she finds out

02:42:48.700 --> 02:42:52.780
that we have somebody who's Japanese in the party OMG

02:42:52.780 --> 02:42:56.860
JP do they even speak American

02:42:56.860 --> 02:43:00.100
I will leave unless they understand what I'm saying

02:43:00.100 --> 02:43:03.180
I will not die because of some JP player

02:43:03.180 --> 02:43:06.100
who can't communicate with me.

02:43:06.100 --> 02:43:07.600
Okay, first off, bitch.

02:43:07.600 --> 02:43:10.600
It's called English, not American.

02:43:10.600 --> 02:43:14.100
Okay? Second off, the game was designed

02:43:14.100 --> 02:43:16.100
so that Japanese and English players can play together.

02:43:16.100 --> 02:43:18.600
That's why you have something called the auto-translate function.

02:43:18.600 --> 02:43:21.100
I suggest you learn how to use it.

02:43:21.100 --> 02:43:24.100
Third off, you are a stupid bitch.

02:43:24.100 --> 02:43:28.100
Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid bitch.

02:43:28.100 --> 02:43:29.100
Yes, Angel.

02:43:29.100 --> 02:43:32.100
His hand is gonna laugh at this.

02:43:32.100 --> 02:43:35.100
Blizzard, Bio, see ya, bye!

02:43:35.100 --> 02:43:36.100
Yeah.

02:43:36.100 --> 02:43:40.100
Anyway, that's it, so SniperKitten, F you.

02:43:40.100 --> 02:43:41.100
Alright.

02:43:41.100 --> 02:43:48.820
Jaded2005, moving on to the chatroom, Jaded2005 would like to say, F you to the Postal Service

02:43:48.820 --> 02:43:52.780
for not delivering my Dance Mania CD sooner.

02:43:52.780 --> 02:43:58.780
Phoenix says, I want to say F U Loki because he puts girls in the cage match which sucked

02:43:58.780 --> 02:44:05.180
and I would like to say F U to the creator of DDR with Mario. Mario is dead! And he just

02:44:05.180 --> 02:44:10.780
wants to add, yeah Loki sucked tonight. He must be a friend of yours or something.

02:44:10.780 --> 02:44:13.780
Whatever girls is going in next week.

02:44:13.780 --> 02:44:20.280
Alright. K-Dash says F U to dumb co-workers that you wish would go away. Dark Knight says

02:44:20.280 --> 02:44:25.180
FU to my arm for being in so much pain after I went go-kart racing last night

02:44:25.180 --> 02:44:29.240
and FU to myself for having a nightmare of a birthday being late for work on

02:44:29.240 --> 02:44:29.920
Thursday

02:44:29.920 --> 02:44:33.800
BRP Ohio Bamani says

02:44:33.800 --> 02:44:37.960
FU to parents and grandparents that don't give the respect to their children and

02:44:37.960 --> 02:44:38.640
grandchildren

02:44:38.640 --> 02:44:42.440
children that they would expect back. FU to Viz

02:44:42.440 --> 02:44:46.400
for holding on to Hikaru no Go anime license and not doing anything with it

02:44:46.400 --> 02:44:47.280
since they got it

02:44:47.280 --> 02:44:50.600
and F.U. to the ice storms that hit the East Coast last week.

02:44:50.600 --> 02:44:56.480
L. Mowat says F.U. to any mission in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas that involves

02:44:56.480 --> 02:45:00.000
aircraft of any kind. The controls are way too sensitive

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:03.360
causing the plane to fly in weird directions when I thought I was going

02:45:03.360 --> 02:45:06.800
straight and doing barrel rolls and slightly leaning on the analog stick the

02:45:06.800 --> 02:45:07.480
wrong way.

02:45:07.480 --> 02:45:11.240
Whoever was in charge of designing the plane controls must have been drunk,

02:45:11.240 --> 02:45:16.240
high, or both. VX Jason XV says

02:45:16.240 --> 02:45:21.080
F you to being so freaking tired yes I'm freaking tired F you to my manager for

02:45:21.080 --> 02:45:25.920

02:45:25.920 --> 02:45:31.480
the ass now and someone important has proof sound scandalous black devil or X

02:45:31.480 --> 02:45:35.440
says F you to the idiot who wrote to el mullet he doesn't sound very bright I

02:45:35.440 --> 02:45:40.000

02:46:26.080 --> 02:46:31.820
if you not having money you know that does kind of suck and lastly dork says

02:46:31.820 --> 02:46:37.500
f you to no one cooking me food I need a freaking girlfriend damn it so now

02:46:37.500 --> 02:46:43.580

Final Fantasy 11 tell the other guy in your house we'll call him that tell the

02:47:07.040 --> 02:47:09.040
tell the guy in your house to quit playing it.

02:47:09.040 --> 02:47:14.040
Alright. There you have it.

02:47:14.040 --> 02:47:18.500
Again, you can email TheLovelyDarkSakura by emailing

02:47:18.500 --> 02:47:21.840
jamie.orensonsradio.com and it will forward to her usual address.

02:47:21.840 --> 02:47:25.440
Yes, it will. I verified it was set up this week.

02:47:25.440 --> 02:47:28.560
So, unless you want to give your other one, I don't care.

02:47:28.560 --> 02:47:31.800
Um, actually

02:47:31.800 --> 02:47:35.000
you can either do it there or

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:47.000
This one time only I'm going to give an email I can check from work. It's darksakra at delbiter.com.

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:49.000
This is the only time I'm giving this one out.

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:54.000
Ooh, okay. Quick stalker fans, write that down.

02:47:54.000 --> 02:48:01.000
Alright. Anna did verify that yes it is indeed husband. My bad, my bad. What can I do?

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:08.000
I like the other guy that lives in your house. Come on, you have to admit that was a good one.

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:16.000
Alright, I got a file from DJ Ron Ma S who was so kind to find this file for me.

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:20.000
Remember earlier when we were talking about DDR featuring Mario?

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:25.000
Well, here's another song that needs to be in the game.

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:29.000
Do the Mario!

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:33.000
Swing your arms, from side to side, come on, it's time to go!

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:37.000
Do the Mario! Take one step, and then again

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:41.000
Let's do the Mario! All together now!

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:45.000
You got it! It's the Mario!

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:49.000
Do the Mario! Swing your arms,

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:53.000
From side to side, come on, it's time to go!

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:59.000
Mario takes one step, and then again let's do the Mario all together now!

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:04.000
Come on now, just like that!

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.000
Just like that!

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000
He sounds like a cross between Cookie Monster and-

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:10.000
I'm just Captain Lou.

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:12.000
Oh god, he was awesome.

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:14.000
And he was Cyndi Lauper's dad in the videos.

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:19.000
Oh, the 80s.

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:27.640
Anyway, it's so funny looking at the chatroom and some people that freaking hate that song

02:49:27.640 --> 02:49:30.840
and some people that really love it.

02:49:30.840 --> 02:49:38.920
I like how L. Mullet puts it, cookie, cookie, I'm not doing the Mario.

02:49:38.920 --> 02:49:46.640
Alright, we're going to, if I didn't read your FU I didn't get one, so resend it I guess.

02:49:46.640 --> 02:49:51.200
we'll read those when we come back. In the meantime we're gonna do one more

02:49:51.200 --> 02:49:54.540
break. We're gonna do a quick break, a couple songs, and then we're gonna come

02:49:54.540 --> 02:49:58.680
back and wrap up the show. That's right, it's time to wrap up the show. So I

02:49:58.680 --> 02:50:01.720
thought I'd play something a little uptempo for you guys. I thought we'd play

02:50:01.720 --> 02:50:05.240
a little bit of something from Guitar Freaks, and then we'll come back and get

02:50:05.240 --> 02:50:12.240
we're ready to wrap up the show. We'll be back.

02:50:35.240 --> 02:50:39.240
I'd like to steal those off the fireball, but it's out of control

02:50:39.240 --> 02:50:44.240
Get to a tornado, soak the fireball, burn the sky like rock and roll

02:50:44.240 --> 02:50:48.240
Get outta here!

02:51:08.240 --> 02:51:12.240
Yeah, this is my transmission, nuclear fission, make them all go

02:51:12.240 --> 02:51:15.740
I need a guy to see a fireball burnin' out of control

02:51:15.740 --> 02:51:19.740
Findin' a ship, gettin' there and questin' that it's in a load

02:51:19.740 --> 02:51:23.740
Beatin' an engine, beatin' a fireball, beatin' out of control

02:51:24.740 --> 02:51:25.740
I'm gonna getcha!

02:51:25.740 --> 02:51:32.740
Shout out to all the great fans who supported your team.

02:51:32.740 --> 02:51:34.740
It's great, man!

02:51:47.740 --> 02:51:51.740
Who can make waves all over town?

02:51:51.740 --> 02:51:55.740
When the TV comes, everybody dance around

02:51:56.740 --> 02:52:01.740
Riverton can do the dolphin ragtime sound

02:52:01.740 --> 02:52:25.740
I was a youth man, a turtle, not a tree I told you, darlin', can't get off the weed

02:52:55.740 --> 02:53:04.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

02:53:04.600 --> 02:53:14.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Listen to Orange Lounge Radio

02:53:14.200 --> 02:53:18.680
Because Bongo demands it You know what?

02:53:18.680 --> 02:53:23.120
I think our chat room tonight has turned into Jamie's personal hell, because like everybody

02:53:23.120 --> 02:53:26.680
from our Final Fantasy XI Link show is coming in.

02:53:26.680 --> 02:53:30.800
I wouldn't call it my own personal hell, you know, I wouldn't have had a problem with Final

02:53:30.800 --> 02:53:36.120
Fantasy XI had I received the support I needed.

02:53:36.120 --> 02:53:37.120
It's a tough game.

02:53:37.120 --> 02:53:38.120
It's tough.

02:53:38.120 --> 02:53:41.760
I'm not saying it was tough, it's just, you know, on Ragnarok there were always people

02:53:41.760 --> 02:53:43.760
playing.

02:53:43.760 --> 02:53:52.240
I could easily go and level completely by myself, but anytime I ever came on and asked

02:53:52.240 --> 02:53:55.240
I'm sorry, we're busy doing some dumbass class.

02:53:55.240 --> 02:53:56.240
Hey, I tried, I tried.

02:53:58.240 --> 02:53:59.240
I said forget it.

02:54:01.240 --> 02:54:06.240
Let's see, what else was I going to say? I don't know, I had something else I was going to say.

02:54:06.240 --> 02:54:08.240
Oh, I wanted to do some late FUs that came in.

02:54:10.240 --> 02:54:17.240
MPQ had some FUs he was trying to send me, but MIRC sucks for some reason, so FU to MIRC says MPQ.

02:54:17.240 --> 02:54:20.240
But he says, here's the in a nutshell version of it.

02:54:20.240 --> 02:54:26.240
Illusions never fixes their bimani, Smokers poison me, and Bill Masterman doesn't know much about how 2DX actually costs.

02:54:26.240 --> 02:54:28.240
Those are all his FUs.

02:54:31.240 --> 02:54:33.240
And, let's see, what was last here?

02:54:33.240 --> 02:54:40.240
DJ Rama S says, I'm putting in my FU, still late, I don't care. FU to people returning iPods that work.

02:54:40.240 --> 02:54:43.240
You retards, and FU to my computer for crashing.

02:54:45.240 --> 02:54:46.240
Alright.

02:54:46.240 --> 02:54:59.240
Wow, where'd it go? We're just about done with the show here. Any late, any other Bahmani news that you can think of that went on this week that I'm completely missing? I can't think of anything. You've been reading the boards though. Loki, anything you can think of?

02:54:59.240 --> 02:55:16.240
Um, no. Nothing really. Actually, I've been paying more attention to building my computer than anything. I've been shopping a lot of that. And, um, I don't know. I've been, no, I haven't really been paying attention.

02:55:16.240 --> 02:55:20.240
I mean, as far as there really hasn't been anything going on, though, that's the thing.

02:55:20.240 --> 02:55:24.240
And, I mean, other than, like, what, those two sim file tournaments that are going on,

02:55:24.240 --> 02:55:29.240
which, I don't even know what the deal is with those, but I don't even really pay attention to those anymore,

02:55:29.240 --> 02:55:32.240
because, you know, all the people that used to make good sim files stopped doing it.

02:55:32.240 --> 02:55:37.240
It's just, like, it's gonna be a whole new resurgence of, you know, I guess before,

02:55:37.240 --> 02:55:41.240
I mean, it wasn't exactly, he wasn't exactly good or anything, but, you know, there was, you know,

02:55:41.240 --> 02:55:44.880
There was, you know, BemoniRuler and everyone was like, oh, I gotta get that stuff.

02:55:44.880 --> 02:55:45.880
No, and then he left.

02:55:45.880 --> 02:55:49.000
And then it was Utterdude, and then everyone was like, oh, I gotta get his stuff.

02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:50.000
Then he's gone.

02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:54.540
And now there's, you know, new people stepping in to take their place, and so it's just the

02:55:54.540 --> 02:55:56.200
whole thing all over again.

02:55:56.200 --> 02:56:00.800
But really, I think the problem is is because DDR Maniacs is down, and so you don't have

02:56:00.800 --> 02:56:05.880
any, like, step mania updates, that's where all your theme stuff was, everything.

02:56:05.880 --> 02:56:11.000
So that's probably why you're missing out on that stuff, and DDR UK is just not quite

02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:14.520
up to you know that stuff I mean they're working hard on those official sim files

02:56:14.520 --> 02:56:21.200
so that'll be fun once that comes out but um really not much I'm you know

02:56:21.200 --> 02:56:29.240
downloading more material for remixing stuff with and I'm just trying to do

02:56:29.240 --> 02:56:32.440
that kind of crap and then hopefully maybe crank something out I don't know

02:56:32.440 --> 02:56:38.720
but um I've thought of some other things but I don't want to commit to anything

02:56:38.720 --> 02:56:43.520
because, you know, I hate, you know, starting projects after I haven't finished other projects.

02:56:43.520 --> 02:56:48.920
So, we'll see. I don't know. No news until there is news, I guess.

02:56:50.920 --> 02:56:56.020
I'm just, I'm hoping the rumors are true that there's gonna be some type of new DDR game this year.

02:56:56.020 --> 02:56:58.920
I mean, besides the Europe thing we already heard about. I mean, obviously there's that.

02:56:58.920 --> 02:57:04.520
We'll find out about that pretty soon, actually. That should be, uh, by the end of next week?

02:57:04.520 --> 02:57:10.640
Like, I'm hoping it's a sign of things to come from not only Japan, but the US as well.

02:57:10.640 --> 02:57:11.820
At least something.

02:57:11.820 --> 02:57:12.820
It's been too long.

02:57:12.820 --> 02:57:14.480
DDR Extreme, we've been sitting on it too long.

02:57:14.480 --> 02:57:16.000
We need something new.

02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:17.280
We're foaming at the mouth here, people!

02:57:17.280 --> 02:57:18.280
We need something new!

02:57:18.280 --> 02:57:21.340
Otherwise, people are going to have to start importing machines from Europe.

02:57:21.340 --> 02:57:22.340
What's with that?

02:57:22.340 --> 02:57:26.140
Well, here is, I think, what the problem was, before it wasn't a matter of, you know, oh,

02:57:26.140 --> 02:57:27.940
we just don't want to release another mix.

02:57:27.940 --> 02:57:32.520
It was a heavy limits of their previous mix, and they had to develop something.

02:57:32.520 --> 02:57:59.520
Kind of like, I'm not really sure with 9th style and 8th style if there was a lull between those, but it's like that. They just have to, you know, they have to kind of redesign everything from the ground up. That's why probably you haven't gotten anything. I mean, since, you know, their arcade division kind of fizzled out, you know, you have to design the hardware for it, and it's a little more difficult than just throwing a PC in there. So, I don't know. That's the only thing I can think of.

02:57:59.520 --> 02:58:04.160
DarkLionXVI sent me this link and I thought we had talked about this on a

02:58:04.160 --> 02:58:07.160
previous show but maybe we missed it. I don't remember. I think we brought it up

02:58:07.160 --> 02:58:11.080
briefly but the website has been updated here and there a little bit. It's

02:58:11.080 --> 02:58:15.480
Karaoke Revolution Bamani Edition and this is coming out in Japan and you can

02:58:15.480 --> 02:58:19.560
sing to pop in music hits and things like that. I don't know if

02:58:19.560 --> 02:58:23.060
there is new stuff that they're putting in here. It looks like there might be a

02:58:23.060 --> 02:58:26.160
few new songs in here. Yeah because I don't think like Mobomogo was in there

02:58:26.160 --> 02:58:30.580
before and uh... kisi k and songs like that

02:58:30.580 --> 02:58:33.760
looks like some new dez rose songs are going to be put in there

02:58:33.760 --> 02:58:37.480
very interesting the songs that they've decided to put in karaoke revolution

02:58:37.480 --> 02:58:38.520
by money

02:58:38.520 --> 02:58:43.200
one thing i notice on the site is that my rave on there you have a kidding me

02:58:43.200 --> 02:58:47.060
uh... loki says that that would be cool though i don't think i see it on there

02:58:47.060 --> 02:58:49.980
just a lot of a lot of popular music type songs are in there

02:58:49.980 --> 02:58:53.300
i'm not just that though you can check out the uh... website over economy style

02:58:53.300 --> 02:58:54.100
dot com

02:58:54.100 --> 02:58:59.300
You notice, though, that Karaoke Revolution in Japan looks a lot different.

02:58:59.300 --> 02:59:04.700
It's not the whole person singing on the stage thing or anything like that.

02:59:04.700 --> 02:59:08.420
It looks like basically a karaoke machine would.

02:59:08.420 --> 02:59:10.180
Kind of not quite as flashy, I don't know.

02:59:10.180 --> 02:59:11.180
Or maybe it is flashy.

02:59:11.180 --> 02:59:12.440
I've got to see this game in motion, really.

02:59:12.440 --> 02:59:15.820
But it doesn't look anything like Karaoke Revolution USA.

02:59:15.820 --> 02:59:21.220
But if you like to sing, you can get on that.

02:59:21.220 --> 02:59:22.220
I don't know.

02:59:22.220 --> 02:59:25.220
They should port over their DDR karaoke mix.

02:59:28.220 --> 02:59:34.220
Another thing that came out recently, which I have to actually update on our game here,

02:59:34.220 --> 02:59:37.220
is Karaoke Revolution 3, which we have.

02:59:37.220 --> 02:59:41.220
Cheat codes came out, so we can unlock all the songs, including Snake Eater.

02:59:41.220 --> 02:59:42.220
Alright!

02:59:42.220 --> 02:59:45.220
Snake Eater is the most ridiculous damn song in that game.

02:59:45.220 --> 02:59:48.220
It can feast on a tree frog.

02:59:49.220 --> 02:59:51.220
Best lyrics ever.

02:59:51.220 --> 03:00:09.220
Oh, and, um, I hate Metal Gear Solid 3, cause, um, us nerds were not meant to be in, um, the jungle, therefore, putting us in the jungle does not work. I went into the jungle and I knew nothing of what I was doing. I was like, oh my god, I'm gonna die.

03:00:09.220 --> 03:00:11.220
What's the feast on a tree frog?

03:00:11.220 --> 03:00:17.220
Well, alligator feasted on me, so yeah. That was the end of that.

03:00:17.220 --> 03:00:23.220
Cause my fucking cheat codes wouldn't work. I wanted to Rambo my way through it, but it wouldn't let me.

03:00:23.220 --> 03:00:25.220
These bastards.

03:00:27.220 --> 03:00:31.220
Alright, it's getting down towards the end of the show guys, so gotta wrap it up.

03:00:31.220 --> 03:00:35.220
Uh, final thoughts. We'll start off with Angel. Your final thought.

03:00:35.220 --> 03:00:39.220
Um, I wanna go play Final Fantasy XI again.

03:00:39.220 --> 03:00:40.220
Attic!

03:00:40.220 --> 03:00:41.220
Hey!

03:00:41.220 --> 03:00:42.220
Wait a minute!

03:00:42.220 --> 03:00:44.940
You're the one that's gonna meet me tonight!

03:00:44.940 --> 03:00:46.740
Final thought, Loki.

03:00:46.740 --> 03:00:48.420
I hope more of my computer stuff comes in.

03:00:48.420 --> 03:00:50.340
Actually, I hope all of it comes in this week.

03:00:50.340 --> 03:00:51.600
Cause I have...

03:00:51.600 --> 03:00:54.980
I think everything's been ordered last week and it shouldn't take that long to ship.

03:00:54.980 --> 03:01:01.140
I just hope all my stuff can come in so I can build it.

03:01:01.140 --> 03:01:03.140
Kick you out of the chatroom?

03:01:03.140 --> 03:01:04.140
Okay.

03:01:04.140 --> 03:01:05.140
Uh...

03:01:05.140 --> 03:01:07.700
Dark Sakura, your final thought?

03:01:07.700 --> 03:01:12.380
I freakin' hate IRC.

03:01:12.380 --> 03:01:17.400
And my final thought is, please tune in to Orange Launch Radio's other programming throughout

03:01:17.400 --> 03:01:23.700
the week. Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Wednesday even, and then Friday over on DER Freak. Listen

03:01:23.700 --> 03:01:27.380
to it! Or I'll cry.

03:01:27.380 --> 03:01:35.660
Alright, that's it. The final word of tonight's show, one word to sum up everything.

03:01:35.660 --> 03:01:37.660
Oh, you want it, Jamie?

03:01:37.660 --> 03:01:39.660
Alright, Jamie, what's the final word?

03:01:39.660 --> 03:01:41.660
Addict!

03:01:41.660 --> 03:01:46.660
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

03:04:29.660 --> 03:04:55.080
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:04:59.660 --> 03:05:19.700
Alright guys, we're back here, Orange Lounge Radio.

03:05:19.700 --> 03:05:23.620
As a reminder, because I know a lot of you guys were off for the past couple weeks, we

03:05:23.620 --> 03:05:27.780
are phasing out the afterbirth segment of the show just because we have other things

03:05:27.780 --> 03:05:31.940
we have to take care of, um, after the shows now, so the afterbirths aren't gonna be around

03:05:31.940 --> 03:05:36.860
a whole lot longer, and plus there will be no more post-show. Um, we'll go right back

03:05:36.860 --> 03:05:41.380
into the Bamani Music and More program, featuring all your favorite DDR, 2DX, and Dance Mini

03:05:41.380 --> 03:05:44.540
favorites. I know you guys might be sad about the loss of the afterbirth, but remember,

03:05:44.540 --> 03:05:47.580
this is how we bring you these other projects that we're doing, like the podcast and things

03:05:47.580 --> 03:05:52.980
like that. So don't cry! Don't cry for me, Argentina! Alright. Did you, did you just

03:05:52.980 --> 03:05:56.900
think that? Alright. Nellie's finally saying something, even though the show's over.

03:05:56.900 --> 03:05:59.280
What exactly all right?

03:06:00.180 --> 03:06:02.760
So that's it. We're now going to go back to

03:06:02.760 --> 03:06:05.880
Back to Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music-
