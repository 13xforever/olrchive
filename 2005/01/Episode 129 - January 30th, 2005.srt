[SPEAKER_19]: Are you allergic to me?

28
00:06:04,786 --> 00:06:07,247
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been like this all day.

29
00:06:07,287 --> 00:06:08,348
[SPEAKER_19]: What is it that you're allergic to?

30
00:06:08,628 --> 00:06:09,068
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything.

31
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:11,949
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not gay people, is it?

32
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,590
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Rob, it's gay people.

34
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:21,593
[SPEAKER_19]: Also joining us, say hello to TechMassaLoki.

35
00:06:21,893 --> 00:06:22,654
[SPEAKER_19]: I found my knife.

36
00:06:24,474 --> 00:06:26,075
[SPEAKER_19]: Please, don't run around the house with it.

37
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:30,497
[SPEAKER_19]: Promise me you will not chase DDR Angel around with your knife again this week.

38
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,842
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I'll have to see about that, but sure.

39
00:06:36,082 --> 00:06:39,044
[SPEAKER_19]: Speaking of DDR Angels, say hello to our special guest.

40
00:06:40,004 --> 00:06:40,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

41
00:06:42,205 --> 00:06:42,986
[SPEAKER_19]: You're always here.

42
00:06:44,707 --> 00:06:45,847
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, now what are you going to call me?

43
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:48,929
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to call you Al.

44
00:06:50,549 --> 00:06:52,490
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know, I just was thinking of the old... forget it.

45
00:06:53,151 --> 00:06:53,431
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway...

46
00:06:54,713 --> 00:06:55,173
[SPEAKER_19]: That's it.

47
00:06:55,534 --> 00:06:57,215
[SPEAKER_19]: Angel's the only special guest here tonight.

48
00:06:57,415 --> 00:07:00,057
[SPEAKER_19]: She's not really that special anymore either, because she's always here.

49
00:07:00,137 --> 00:07:02,218
[SPEAKER_19]: So she's just your standard guest.

50
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:04,660
[SPEAKER_19]: She's more of a standard guest than a special guest.

51
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:06,461
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just your pest.

52
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:09,864
[SPEAKER_19]: No, no, no.

53
00:07:09,924 --> 00:07:13,687
[SPEAKER_19]: You wouldn't be a pest, because then when I sprayed the raid on you, it would have gotten rid of you.

54
00:07:14,527 --> 00:07:15,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Raid?

55
00:07:15,828 --> 00:07:17,369
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just kidding.

56
00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:18,110
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

57
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:19,871
[SPEAKER_19]: But it's just us.

58
00:07:20,912 --> 00:07:24,715
[SPEAKER_19]: Feeling the love here in the Orange Lounge Radio Studio, especially after a chaotic week last week.

59
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,796
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish I felt the love for my allergy medicine.

60
00:07:27,417 --> 00:07:28,217
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

61
00:07:29,438 --> 00:07:30,759
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, this should be a lovely night.

62
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,742
[SPEAKER_19]: Jamie's extra sassy because of her allergies.

63
00:07:34,842 --> 00:07:35,822
[SPEAKER_19]: Loki's got a knife.

64
00:07:38,264 --> 00:07:39,485
[SPEAKER_19]: This should be an interesting show.

65
00:07:39,845 --> 00:07:46,710
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just trying to turn this into a round cable, but I think I just broke it.

66
00:07:48,345 --> 00:07:51,506
[SPEAKER_19]: So basically you've got a square cable over there and you're trying to turn it into a round cable.

67
00:07:51,526 --> 00:07:52,827
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a ribbon cable.

68
00:07:53,127 --> 00:07:57,108
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought, at least in theory, that I could split these down here.

69
00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:07,893
[SPEAKER_17]: However, they're a little thinner than I thought, so when I poked this knife through, instead of actually splitting it, it stripped all the covering on this one wire here.

70
00:08:08,653 --> 00:08:08,933
[SPEAKER_19]: Hmm.

71
00:08:09,353 --> 00:08:09,753
[SPEAKER_19]: Interesting.

72
00:08:10,594 --> 00:08:11,114
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, well...

73
00:08:11,471 --> 00:08:12,032
[SPEAKER_17]: No, not really.

74
00:08:12,052 --> 00:08:13,273
[SPEAKER_19]: Not really, yeah.

75
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:20,658
[SPEAKER_19]: You can see the action because Loki has decided to go sit in front of the webcam because people say that the webcam is never that exciting.

76
00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:21,799
[SPEAKER_19]: So Loki is cutting things.

77
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:23,060
[SPEAKER_17]: I just happened to find my knife over here.

78
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,861
[SPEAKER_17]: That's why I sat down.

79
00:08:24,141 --> 00:08:25,703
[SPEAKER_19]: Loki's cutting things on cam.

80
00:08:25,943 --> 00:08:31,968
[SPEAKER_19]: www.orgsloungeradio.com And if somebody in studio pisses him off enough, they might get cut tonight.

81
00:08:32,288 --> 00:08:32,668
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll see.

82
00:08:32,868 --> 00:08:33,369
[SPEAKER_16]: Gotta expect.

83
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:37,112
[SPEAKER_19]: They can't hear that.

84
00:08:38,113 --> 00:08:38,633
[SPEAKER_19]: Whatever.

85
00:08:38,713 --> 00:08:39,594
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't fucking care.

86
00:08:39,614 --> 00:08:39,854
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

87
00:08:40,825 --> 00:08:42,445
[SPEAKER_19]: Tonight is definitely one of those nights.

88
00:08:43,826 --> 00:08:45,406
[SPEAKER_11]: I want the world to die.

89
00:08:46,046 --> 00:08:53,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything good in this world needs to wither and die and stop spreading your goddamn pollen.

90
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:55,808
[SPEAKER_17]: Please.

91
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:58,469
[SPEAKER_17]: And the person in the chatroom named Come As You Are.

92
00:08:58,989 --> 00:08:59,449
[SPEAKER_17]: No script.

93
00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:00,209
[SPEAKER_17]: Bad.

94
00:09:00,849 --> 00:09:01,829
[SPEAKER_11]: Go ahead and boot their ass.

95
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:04,650
[SPEAKER_17]: What the hell?

96
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,374
[SPEAKER_19]: That calls for Instaban.

97
00:09:08,734 --> 00:09:10,635
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, we'll handle that.

98
00:09:11,076 --> 00:09:13,517
[SPEAKER_19]: As soon as we come back after these lovely songs.

99
00:09:14,318 --> 00:09:19,681
[SPEAKER_19]: In this break, random 2DX songs from Yonder Pass.

100
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,443
[SPEAKER_19]: They're old 2DX songs that we don't play that often.

101
00:09:22,803 --> 00:09:27,467
[SPEAKER_19]: Because, you know, last week we had people bitching, You guys play the same songs all the time.

102
00:09:27,507 --> 00:09:28,747
[SPEAKER_19]: Every week we have to hear Skull.

103
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:30,188
[SPEAKER_19]: Why don't you play something new?

104
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:31,209
[SPEAKER_19]: So fine.

105
00:09:31,729 --> 00:09:32,590
[SPEAKER_19]: You get some random stuff.

106
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:33,491
[SPEAKER_19]: We should play Girls.

107
00:09:34,171 --> 00:09:34,411
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

108
00:09:34,932 --> 00:09:35,652
[SPEAKER_19]: God damn it.

109
00:09:35,832 --> 00:09:36,953
[SPEAKER_19]: Let that die already.

110
00:09:37,503 --> 00:09:37,944
[SPEAKER_19]: No!

111
00:09:39,785 --> 00:09:47,973
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, we'll be back after this with more Orange Launch Radio, maybe some Bomani news, some random video game stuff.

112
00:09:48,294 --> 00:09:54,259
[SPEAKER_19]: Jamie wants to take this show tonight in a really random video game direction, but I don't care, we're going to do it.

113
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,843
[SPEAKER_19]: So stay tuned, we'll be back after this with Don't Stop!

114
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:53,036
I'll take you up, oh sweet baby As years go by

115
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:23,572
I win!

116
00:13:02,092 --> 00:13:02,433
Thank you.

117
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:47,660
Thank you.

118
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,375
Thank you for watching!

119
00:15:21,577 --> 00:15:24,175
Thanks for watching!

120
00:17:06,636 --> 00:17:08,737
[SPEAKER_19]: I love that promo because it's the only one we have.

121
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:12,360
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the only promo we have where I get to hear Jamie click like a chicken.

122
00:17:16,142 --> 00:17:17,823
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't do any imitations right now.

123
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:18,684
[SPEAKER_15]: Aww.

124
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:19,484
[SPEAKER_11]: Except one.

125
00:17:19,965 --> 00:17:20,165
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

126
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:24,590
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

127
00:17:48,182 --> 00:17:49,504
[SPEAKER_26]: It's the Grudge Show!

128
00:17:49,604 --> 00:17:51,886
[SPEAKER_19]: Who's soul will Tobio take today?

129
00:17:54,808 --> 00:18:04,417
[SPEAKER_19]: Starring... and... Oh, wow, we're dumb.

130
00:18:04,797 --> 00:18:05,958
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, here we are.

131
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,162
[SPEAKER_19]: Another week is upon us here at the Orange Lounge Radio Headquarters.

132
00:18:10,939 --> 00:18:11,679
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

133
00:18:33,973 --> 00:18:34,873
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

134
00:18:57,475 --> 00:19:01,677
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I don't know, but they're cool, I like them, and I wanted to go see them play live.

135
00:19:01,977 --> 00:19:15,903
[SPEAKER_19]: Me and the boys were gonna go catch the Scissor Sister, like me and, you know, some of my friends, but we... I kind of made a mistake, because when I tried to go in and get tickets, the only tickets that were available were in, like, the back, back, back row.

136
00:19:16,163 --> 00:19:19,344
[SPEAKER_19]: Like, it was row, like, double Y in the second balcony, okay?

137
00:19:19,364 --> 00:19:20,345
[SPEAKER_19]: It was that far back.

138
00:19:20,665 --> 00:19:21,125
[SPEAKER_19]: And I was like...

139
00:19:21,772 --> 00:19:48,532
[SPEAKER_19]: Fuck that, I'm not going to get tickets if I have to sit that far back So I'm going to wait, because usually with concerts, this is a trick a lot of people don't know They'll open up better tickets like a week before Or, you know, sometimes you can get general admission So we were trying to get floor seats, but it never opened up I kept checking every day and I was not able to get better tickets So therefore I'm here tonight, where somewhere in the city, by the bay Scissor Sisters is taking the stage right now, and I'm not there

140
00:19:49,465 --> 00:19:51,125
[SPEAKER_19]: Therefore, I'm a little bit bitter tonight.

141
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:54,346
[SPEAKER_19]: If I sound a little bit bitter, it's because I could be somewhere else.

142
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:55,407
[SPEAKER_19]: That's alright.

143
00:19:55,427 --> 00:20:01,368
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to start off tonight's show as we do every week, playing a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.

144
00:20:01,428 --> 00:20:02,569
[SPEAKER_19]: Jamie, how was your week, how was your day?

145
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,210
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been sneezing all fucking day.

146
00:20:09,771 --> 00:20:13,552
[SPEAKER_11]: I made it to level 10 in a week on fucking game.

147
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,321
[SPEAKER_19]: Also known as Final Fantasy XI.

148
00:20:18,902 --> 00:20:20,263
[SPEAKER_11]: Been going to school.

149
00:20:20,724 --> 00:20:22,065
[SPEAKER_11]: My teacher's an asshole.

150
00:20:22,965 --> 00:20:25,887
[SPEAKER_11]: More like an elitist snob, but eh.

151
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:29,770
[SPEAKER_11]: Just stuff, really.

152
00:20:31,111 --> 00:20:36,014
[SPEAKER_11]: I went bowling yesterday with Iguana Girl and Islander.

153
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:36,775
[SPEAKER_19]: You went bowling?

154
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:37,455
[SPEAKER_11]: I went bowling.

155
00:20:37,475 --> 00:20:39,177
[SPEAKER_11]: I scored five strikes my second game.

156
00:20:39,297 --> 00:20:39,637
[SPEAKER_19]: Nice.

157
00:20:41,638 --> 00:20:42,619
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you do the strike dance?

158
00:20:42,639 --> 00:20:42,699
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

159
00:20:42,998 --> 00:20:43,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Drake!

160
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:44,679
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you do that?

161
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:45,560
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

162
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,462
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

163
00:20:47,542 --> 00:20:49,103
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we went to Mikuni.

164
00:20:49,703 --> 00:20:50,784
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, Jamie.

165
00:20:51,185 --> 00:20:53,146
[SPEAKER_19]: We should start an Orange Lounge Bowling League.

166
00:20:54,367 --> 00:20:54,807
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, no.

167
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:55,928
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

168
00:20:56,829 --> 00:20:57,750
[SPEAKER_19]: Come on!

169
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:01,233
[SPEAKER_19]: We could all have orange bowling balls.

170
00:21:01,733 --> 00:21:02,273
[SPEAKER_19]: Come on.

171
00:21:02,514 --> 00:21:03,154
[SPEAKER_19]: It'd be cute.

172
00:21:03,254 --> 00:21:04,195
[SPEAKER_19]: And we could all have this... Rob.

173
00:21:04,815 --> 00:21:05,116
[SPEAKER_19]: Rob.

174
00:21:05,476 --> 00:21:05,756
[SPEAKER_19]: Rob.

175
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:06,257
[SPEAKER_19]: Rob.

176
00:21:07,698 --> 00:21:08,038
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob.

177
00:21:08,278 --> 00:21:08,578
[SPEAKER_19]: What?

178
00:21:09,199 --> 00:21:09,599
[SPEAKER_19]: What?

179
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:10,360
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

180
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:10,420
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

181
00:21:12,318 --> 00:21:21,764
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey Rob, once I had a really good idea just like that, you know, it was to put a Russian space station around, you know, orbit, around Earth.

182
00:21:21,784 --> 00:21:23,585
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, that didn't turn out very well.

183
00:21:23,805 --> 00:21:24,766
[SPEAKER_19]: Let Jamie finish her week.

184
00:21:25,866 --> 00:21:30,209
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been sneezing all day.

185
00:21:30,469 --> 00:21:31,710
[SPEAKER_11]: Woke up with a cat on my head.

186
00:21:33,951 --> 00:21:38,434
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I just, I'm done.

187
00:21:39,574 --> 00:21:41,896
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not very often that Jamie wakes up with pussy in her face.

188
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:44,659
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

189
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:46,920
[SPEAKER_10]: That wasn't funny.

190
00:21:47,921 --> 00:21:51,602
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought it was funny and I didn't even hear the... I was laughing before the joke.

191
00:21:51,742 --> 00:21:57,464
[SPEAKER_19]: The reaction we got in studio when I said that, just Jamie, she's got this very dead look on her face.

192
00:21:57,484 --> 00:22:00,585
[SPEAKER_19]: Like, you know, kind of like... You know, she's got that look on her face right now.

193
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:01,546
[SPEAKER_19]: She's kind of leaning back.

194
00:22:01,986 --> 00:22:07,068
[SPEAKER_19]: She's staring off into space, staring at the ceiling, going, you know, I don't want to be here, type thing.

195
00:22:07,088 --> 00:22:11,090
[SPEAKER_19]: And then when I said that, you know... And she doesn't often get pussy on her face.

196
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:11,990
[SPEAKER_19]: She's just kind of...

197
00:22:12,646 --> 00:22:15,227
[SPEAKER_19]: Reaches over and grabs the mic and goes, you know what?

198
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:19,889
[SPEAKER_11]: No, my cat didn't poop.

199
00:22:20,449 --> 00:22:21,070
[SPEAKER_11]: That's sick.

200
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,230
[SPEAKER_19]: Sometimes I wish we were a TV show.

201
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:23,831
[SPEAKER_19]: I really do.

202
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:36,296
[SPEAKER_11]: I've taken two doses of Advil cold sinus, a dose of Benadryl, and two doses of Tylenol allergy sinus.

203
00:22:37,836 --> 00:22:41,498
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm drugged, upset, I ate.

204
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,361
[SPEAKER_11]: Three Lindered Chocolate Balls on the way here.

205
00:22:45,561 --> 00:22:46,761
[SPEAKER_19]: Were they salty chocolate balls?

206
00:22:47,021 --> 00:22:47,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, hush.

207
00:22:47,961 --> 00:22:48,782
[SPEAKER_11]: They were dark chocolate.

208
00:22:50,722 --> 00:22:57,264
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I go look at my friends list to see freaking sluts on my friends list on my live journal.

209
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:02,705
[SPEAKER_19]: I got sluts on my friends list too, but that's just how they... But I need pictures of sluts.

210
00:23:02,805 --> 00:23:04,705
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, I'm like, these are actual people.

211
00:23:05,025 --> 00:23:06,046
[SPEAKER_19]: I just have to accept them.

212
00:23:06,066 --> 00:23:06,746
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the way they are.

213
00:23:06,766 --> 00:23:08,066
[SPEAKER_17]: I never get sluts on my friends list.

214
00:23:10,115 --> 00:23:11,376
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, my life is miserable.

215
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,237
[SPEAKER_19]: Join a couple gay live journal communities.

216
00:23:13,257 --> 00:23:14,758
[SPEAKER_19]: You can get tons of sluts on your friends' page.

217
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:18,480
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

218
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:29,986
[SPEAKER_11]: I need... Wow.

219
00:23:31,107 --> 00:23:31,367
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow.

220
00:23:31,707 --> 00:23:32,688
[SPEAKER_19]: Loki, how was your week?

221
00:23:32,728 --> 00:23:33,288
[SPEAKER_19]: How was your day?

222
00:23:34,609 --> 00:23:34,689
[SPEAKER_19]: Um...

223
00:23:36,138 --> 00:23:38,019
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, my week was okay.

224
00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:40,399
[SPEAKER_17]: Didn't really do too much.

225
00:23:41,459 --> 00:23:43,780
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see.

226
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:48,121
[SPEAKER_17]: Friday, Christopher brought over the parts for his PC, so I built that.

227
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:52,262
[SPEAKER_17]: And that was fun, until I couldn't figure out why I wasn't booting.

228
00:23:52,282 --> 00:23:55,323
[SPEAKER_17]: It's because... Now...

229
00:23:55,888 --> 00:24:09,355
[SPEAKER_17]: The motherboard I bought has actually two different chipsets on it, you know, so you can run the older Athlon processors, and you can run the new 64-bit ones, the ones beside, you know, above 3.2 gigahertz or whatever.

230
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:18,901
[SPEAKER_17]: So, anyways, I had the processor in the right one, but I had the RAM in the wrong set of slots there, so it wasn't booting up.

231
00:24:19,901 --> 00:24:22,323
[SPEAKER_17]: Finally figured that out after about six hours, and then...

232
00:24:24,793 --> 00:24:25,654
[SPEAKER_17]: Loaded that all up.

233
00:24:25,754 --> 00:24:26,596
[SPEAKER_17]: It looks really cool.

234
00:24:41,883 --> 00:24:48,769
[SPEAKER_17]: And then on my computer, which is sitting in the middle of the room right now, I installed the motherboard in that and cut the rest of the case.

235
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:52,112
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm pretty much ready to go with that.

236
00:24:52,132 --> 00:24:57,397
[SPEAKER_17]: I probably should set it up to install everything.

237
00:24:57,897 --> 00:25:01,981
[SPEAKER_17]: So I was messing around with that.

238
00:25:02,141 --> 00:25:03,963
[SPEAKER_17]: And then played lots of Final Fantasy.

239
00:25:05,324 --> 00:25:05,524
[SPEAKER_17]: And...

240
00:25:07,626 --> 00:25:11,108
[SPEAKER_17]: They didn't do too much else other than that.

241
00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:16,471
[SPEAKER_17]: The first night when Christopher brought his computer over on Friday, I stayed up until 6 in the morning.

242
00:25:16,971 --> 00:25:20,373
[SPEAKER_17]: And then last night I stayed up until 6 in the morning playing Final Fantasy.

243
00:25:21,273 --> 00:25:27,417
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm kind of like my whole schedule is messed up right now.

244
00:25:28,397 --> 00:25:29,598
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been staying up way too late.

245
00:25:31,178 --> 00:25:32,099
[SPEAKER_19]: And you have to work tomorrow, huh?

246
00:25:33,101 --> 00:25:36,842
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it's going to be great though because my co-worker's quitting.

247
00:25:38,522 --> 00:25:39,783
[SPEAKER_17]: So now they're going to be panicking.

248
00:25:40,503 --> 00:25:44,444
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's great because I'm just an observer in their panic.

249
00:25:45,164 --> 00:25:45,884
[SPEAKER_17]: So it'll be fun.

250
00:25:46,884 --> 00:25:50,625
[SPEAKER_17]: Then this week I have to go see the Kings in floor seats.

251
00:25:51,825 --> 00:25:58,227
[SPEAKER_17]: I hate the Kings, but I'm taking my mom because whatever, I couldn't really do much of these tickets, so.

252
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:04,293
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, DT says I should invest in a Mac Mini.

253
00:26:04,593 --> 00:26:06,555
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I'm sorry, I already have a toaster.

254
00:26:06,915 --> 00:26:09,617
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't need a piece of shit computer that's small.

255
00:26:10,098 --> 00:26:12,299
[SPEAKER_19]: Why do you hate Apple computers so much?

256
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:18,304
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I remember the day I brought home my iPod, you were like... Okay.

257
00:26:19,076 --> 00:26:19,696
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll tell you why.

258
00:26:20,196 --> 00:26:25,017
[SPEAKER_17]: Back in the day when I had to do fucking school assignments at the Mac Lab at our school, okay?

259
00:26:25,277 --> 00:26:27,258
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll tell you what, those things are a piece of shit.

260
00:26:27,298 --> 00:26:29,298
[SPEAKER_17]: You put the disc in, the whole thing explodes.

261
00:26:29,738 --> 00:26:32,899
[SPEAKER_17]: That is pretty much how reliable Macintosh computers are.

262
00:26:32,939 --> 00:26:34,799
[SPEAKER_19]: They're computers for idiots!

263
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:42,281
[SPEAKER_19]: But I remember in the computer school lab, the Macs, when you turn them on, you'd see the little picture of the computer and it had the little happy face.

264
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:44,501
[SPEAKER_17]: You don't buy computers because they're cute!

265
00:26:45,141 --> 00:26:47,643
[SPEAKER_17]: You buy them because they work and they're functional.

266
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:50,205
[SPEAKER_17]: You don't buy fucking cute computers.

267
00:26:50,846 --> 00:26:54,229
[SPEAKER_17]: You shouldn't choose a computer because, oh, it'll match my curtains.

268
00:26:54,609 --> 00:26:55,309
[SPEAKER_17]: Fuck that.

269
00:26:56,190 --> 00:27:02,035
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, but it'll still get on the internet, and the fact that it matches the curtains is a plus.

270
00:27:02,055 --> 00:27:05,638
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, you know, an old 386 computer will get on the internet too, but you know what?

271
00:27:05,658 --> 00:27:06,779
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not going to be using that.

272
00:27:09,601 --> 00:27:10,802
[SPEAKER_11]: They're good if you're a graphic artist.

273
00:27:11,348 --> 00:27:13,610
[SPEAKER_11]: A-ha, a-ha, good graphics.

274
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:23,558
[SPEAKER_11]: And actually, you can link, for every Mac you have linked up, it will increase the entire processing power of the entire unit because of the dual processing system.

275
00:27:23,798 --> 00:27:26,600
[SPEAKER_11]: You can actually get more power out of a Mac than you can out of a PC.

276
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,641
[SPEAKER_19]: You can do that with anything.

277
00:27:28,202 --> 00:27:30,844
[SPEAKER_19]: And they do the video editing really easy, really easy.

278
00:27:31,653 --> 00:27:32,713
[SPEAKER_19]: You can do that with anything.

279
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:34,614
[SPEAKER_19]: You can film the kitty.

280
00:27:34,774 --> 00:27:43,836
[SPEAKER_19]: You can film your kitty cat and then really easily put it on your Mac and you can make little videos like my kitty and string it all together and then you put music in the background.

281
00:27:44,216 --> 00:27:45,816
[SPEAKER_19]: So cute and so easy on a Mac.

282
00:27:46,237 --> 00:27:47,717
[SPEAKER_17]: You can do that with Windows too.

283
00:27:47,757 --> 00:27:49,357
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, but everything crashes in Windows.

284
00:27:49,757 --> 00:27:51,958
[SPEAKER_17]: No, not everything crashes in Windows.

285
00:27:52,098 --> 00:27:54,359
[SPEAKER_17]: Everything crashes in Windows.

286
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:55,219
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't get me wrong.

287
00:27:55,239 --> 00:27:55,559
[SPEAKER_17]: I love Windows.

288
00:27:55,579 --> 00:27:57,039
[SPEAKER_17]: Look at all those fucking games for the Macs.

289
00:28:01,047 --> 00:28:02,148
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh wait, no there isn't!

290
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:03,969
[SPEAKER_19]: That's right, because they suck!

291
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:06,331
[SPEAKER_19]: Now wait a minute, wait a minute.

292
00:28:06,671 --> 00:28:12,535
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, I'll tell you what's cool about Macs, are the laptops, the little iBooks.

293
00:28:13,076 --> 00:28:16,338
[SPEAKER_19]: The little apple, when you use it on the back, it glows.

294
00:28:17,619 --> 00:28:21,041
[SPEAKER_19]: So, let's say you ever have to be in the dark.

295
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:24,324
[SPEAKER_19]: The apple will glow, and it gives you... Shut up.

296
00:28:24,864 --> 00:28:25,344
[SPEAKER_19]: Stop.

297
00:28:26,545 --> 00:28:27,106
[SPEAKER_19]: But it's cute.

298
00:28:30,526 --> 00:28:32,467
[SPEAKER_19]: Have you ever been to the Apple Store at the mall?

299
00:28:32,647 --> 00:28:34,227
[SPEAKER_19]: It's blinding!

300
00:28:34,307 --> 00:28:36,148
[SPEAKER_19]: Here at the local mall, yeah, they have an Apple Store.

301
00:28:36,528 --> 00:28:38,969
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't know how they light that thing.

302
00:28:39,109 --> 00:28:45,872
[SPEAKER_19]: I think they actually took a little chunk of the sun and put it inside the Apple Store because it is so freaking bright in there.

303
00:28:49,473 --> 00:28:52,434
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it's like, you know... No, no, I'm sorry.

304
00:28:52,634 --> 00:28:57,956
[SPEAKER_17]: I am... I will never, ever, ever... I'm going down the record stands.

305
00:28:58,177 --> 00:28:59,217
[SPEAKER_17]: I will never own...

306
00:28:59,873 --> 00:29:01,493
[SPEAKER_17]: Anything that's made by Apple.

307
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:02,494
[SPEAKER_17]: Nothing.

308
00:29:03,134 --> 00:29:04,434
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not buying an iPod.

309
00:29:04,814 --> 00:29:05,914
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not buying a computer.

310
00:29:06,075 --> 00:29:07,855
[SPEAKER_17]: I will not buy a laptop made by them.

311
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:08,295
[SPEAKER_17]: Nothing.

312
00:29:09,235 --> 00:29:11,596
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, Apple is a fully unsubsidiary of Microsoft.

313
00:29:12,536 --> 00:29:13,036
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what?

314
00:29:14,517 --> 00:29:16,517
[SPEAKER_17]: Did I say Microsoft?

315
00:29:16,757 --> 00:29:17,677
[SPEAKER_17]: I said Apple.

316
00:29:20,918 --> 00:29:21,458
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what?

317
00:29:21,838 --> 00:29:23,699
[SPEAKER_19]: You should hold your tongue and say Apple.

318
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:24,519
[SPEAKER_19]: It's really funny.

319
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:28,400
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

320
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,011
[SPEAKER_17]: Apple.

321
00:29:31,112 --> 00:29:34,895
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I think I graduated from elementary school a while ago.

322
00:29:36,616 --> 00:29:39,539
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, this is coming from someone who said that the chair was not green.

323
00:29:41,961 --> 00:29:42,761
[SPEAKER_19]: The chair's green.

324
00:29:42,821 --> 00:29:43,722
[SPEAKER_19]: I think the chair's green.

325
00:29:43,862 --> 00:29:44,763
[SPEAKER_19]: It's mostly black.

326
00:29:44,823 --> 00:29:46,124
[SPEAKER_19]: It's green!

327
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:52,229
[SPEAKER_17]: If you take green, or black, and add a little bit of green to that, that is mainly black.

328
00:29:52,569 --> 00:29:54,371
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a night green.

329
00:29:55,984 --> 00:29:56,524
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what?

330
00:29:56,925 --> 00:29:57,925
[SPEAKER_17]: It's black, okay?

331
00:29:58,446 --> 00:30:02,348
[SPEAKER_19]: I will take a piece of that chair into a paint match store and we will settle this debate.

332
00:30:02,548 --> 00:30:03,389
[SPEAKER_17]: It's fucking black.

333
00:30:03,489 --> 00:30:04,570
[SPEAKER_17]: Just like my trench coat.

334
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:07,011
[SPEAKER_17]: My trench coat's blue, but it's fucking black.

335
00:30:07,031 --> 00:30:09,553
[SPEAKER_17]: It looks black, therefore it's black, okay?

336
00:30:09,973 --> 00:30:12,675
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care if it has a hint of green in it.

337
00:30:12,695 --> 00:30:13,816
[SPEAKER_11]: It's still black.

338
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:14,717
[SPEAKER_19]: Hold on, hold on a minute.

339
00:30:15,717 --> 00:30:16,618
[SPEAKER_11]: It actually is more green.

340
00:30:17,138 --> 00:30:17,658
[SPEAKER_19]: Hold on a minute.

341
00:30:21,061 --> 00:30:21,301
[SPEAKER_19]: Whatever.

342
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:22,181
[SPEAKER_19]: Hold on, hold on, I'm working.

343
00:30:22,842 --> 00:30:24,083
[SPEAKER_19]: No way, I want you to rant a little more here.

344
00:30:24,443 --> 00:30:25,884
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just, you know, finding some music here.

345
00:30:32,048 --> 00:30:33,709
[SPEAKER_19]: The chair is green.

346
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:35,230
[SPEAKER_17]: Black.

347
00:30:35,631 --> 00:30:36,091
[SPEAKER_17]: Green.

348
00:30:36,391 --> 00:30:36,832
[SPEAKER_17]: Black.

349
00:30:36,892 --> 00:30:37,332
[SPEAKER_17]: Green.

350
00:30:37,652 --> 00:30:38,132
[SPEAKER_17]: Black.

351
00:30:40,014 --> 00:30:41,255
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a goddamn chair!

352
00:30:42,456 --> 00:30:45,358
[SPEAKER_17]: If Justin Timberlake can be black, that chair can be black, okay?

353
00:30:50,581 --> 00:30:51,302
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you finished?

354
00:30:51,762 --> 00:30:51,962
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

355
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:53,223
[SPEAKER_19]: Angel, how was your week?

356
00:30:53,243 --> 00:30:53,824
[SPEAKER_19]: How was your day?

357
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:56,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob made my tongue numb.

358
00:30:57,326 --> 00:30:57,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah!

359
00:30:58,187 --> 00:30:59,488
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even want to know how that happened.

360
00:31:00,205 --> 00:31:01,486
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry, I won't bite so hard next time.

361
00:31:01,506 --> 00:31:02,507
[SPEAKER_19]: What are you talking about?

362
00:31:04,008 --> 00:31:04,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Stupid Altoids.

363
00:31:06,589 --> 00:31:07,610
[SPEAKER_19]: And that was your week and your day?

364
00:31:08,871 --> 00:31:09,091
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

365
00:31:12,473 --> 00:31:13,294
[SPEAKER_10]: Final Fantasy XI.

366
00:31:16,336 --> 00:31:19,017
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, when I was on, you guys weren't, because you guys had to work.

367
00:31:20,138 --> 00:31:25,001
[SPEAKER_10]: But then again, I had school, so... Not much happened.

368
00:31:25,242 --> 00:31:27,223
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm supposed to say hi to Mikey, so hi Mikey!

369
00:31:27,938 --> 00:31:32,840
[SPEAKER_10]: otherwise known as BRPOhiovaMoney That's quick.

370
00:31:34,113 --> 00:31:35,093
[SPEAKER_19]: My week and my day.

371
00:31:35,633 --> 00:31:37,254
[SPEAKER_19]: Really, not a whole lot going on.

372
00:31:37,314 --> 00:31:39,214
[SPEAKER_19]: I did play a little bit of Final Fantasy.

373
00:31:39,494 --> 00:31:40,775
[SPEAKER_19]: I had days off, actually, this week.

374
00:31:40,795 --> 00:31:44,796
[SPEAKER_19]: I took Monday and Tuesday off of work, and oh my god, I had this big list of things I was going to do.

375
00:31:45,256 --> 00:31:51,917
[SPEAKER_19]: I was going to go to the mall, and I was going to go shopping, and there was all this stuff I wanted to buy, like new socks and underwear and things.

376
00:31:52,237 --> 00:32:00,579
[SPEAKER_19]: I was going to buy all this stuff at the mall, and then, let's see, I was going to go to Ikea one day, and then I was going to clean my room from top to bottom.

377
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:03,380
[SPEAKER_19]: I had this big project where I was going to totally redo my room and clean it,

378
00:32:04,281 --> 00:32:08,744
[SPEAKER_19]: and I didn't get any of that done because I was leveling in Final Fantasy all day both days.

379
00:32:14,128 --> 00:32:15,429
[SPEAKER_19]: I think I'm just going to uninstall it.

380
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:17,051
[SPEAKER_19]: Then I won't be tempted to play it anymore.

381
00:32:20,353 --> 00:32:24,177
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm seriously wondering how much would I get done if Final Fantasy XI wasn't installed.

382
00:32:24,437 --> 00:32:27,099
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what though, seriously, if it wasn't that, it would be some other game.

383
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:29,581
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd go right back to playing Final Fantasy X or something.

384
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:33,910
[SPEAKER_19]: Loki says, at least I'd finish the damn game.

385
00:32:35,391 --> 00:32:36,311
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, whatever.

386
00:32:36,651 --> 00:32:41,074
[SPEAKER_19]: And now they're yelling at me, I can't uninstall the game.

387
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:43,335
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's see, what else?

388
00:32:43,835 --> 00:32:45,095
[SPEAKER_19]: What else is going on in Rob's world?

389
00:32:47,997 --> 00:32:50,018
[SPEAKER_19]: Yesterday we went out to sushi, that was cool.

390
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:56,681
[SPEAKER_19]: We went to wasabi, which is cool, because when you walk in the door, they all yell at you from behind the bar, WASABI!

391
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:58,962
[SPEAKER_19]: When you walk in, WASABI!

392
00:32:59,803 --> 00:33:00,063
[SPEAKER_07]: WASABI!

393
00:33:01,983 --> 00:33:02,983
[SPEAKER_19]: And it always scares me.

394
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:05,524
[SPEAKER_19]: It always scares me when I walk in there.

395
00:33:05,564 --> 00:33:06,444
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like, you know, I walk in.

396
00:33:07,404 --> 00:33:09,305
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to walk into a nice little sushi restaurant.

397
00:33:09,365 --> 00:33:12,846
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you sure they're not saying it ashamase?

398
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:14,246
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

399
00:33:14,506 --> 00:33:15,466
[SPEAKER_19]: It always sounds like wasabi.

400
00:33:16,607 --> 00:33:18,107
[SPEAKER_19]: I always thought they were saying the name of the restaurant.

401
00:33:18,787 --> 00:33:20,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, because I know Mikuni does it.

402
00:33:20,688 --> 00:33:25,549
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like any time you go into an establishment, they're supposed to go ashamase, which is like welcome.

403
00:33:26,569 --> 00:33:26,649
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh.

404
00:33:27,341 --> 00:33:27,801
[SPEAKER_11]: What else?

405
00:33:58,041 --> 00:34:01,843
[SPEAKER_19]: I had this whole list of things I was going to talk about, but I can't think of any, so I guess we'll just have to move on.

406
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:06,605
[SPEAKER_19]: I wish I had some exciting DDR story to tell, but I really don't.

407
00:34:07,246 --> 00:34:08,186
[SPEAKER_19]: I haven't been to the arcade in a while.

408
00:34:08,206 --> 00:34:09,747
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm still waiting for them to set up 2DX.

409
00:34:10,087 --> 00:34:11,628
[SPEAKER_19]: We're supposed to be getting 2DX here locally.

410
00:34:11,668 --> 00:34:12,989
[SPEAKER_19]: That was supposed to happen, what, four weeks ago?

411
00:34:13,669 --> 00:34:15,810
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess they're waiting on a part, so we'll see.

412
00:34:16,711 --> 00:34:17,011
[SPEAKER_19]: Loki?

413
00:34:17,331 --> 00:34:18,071
[SPEAKER_19]: Loki has a comment.

414
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:21,713
[SPEAKER_17]: It'll never happen.

415
00:34:22,233 --> 00:34:23,994
[SPEAKER_17]: They'll just keep talking and hinting at it.

416
00:34:24,475 --> 00:34:27,056
[SPEAKER_17]: The monitor will constantly be in trend to us.

417
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:28,605
[SPEAKER_17]: It'll never happen.

418
00:34:28,846 --> 00:34:30,366
[SPEAKER_11]: I took fucking pictures of it.

419
00:34:31,307 --> 00:34:32,087
[SPEAKER_19]: But there's no monitor.

420
00:34:32,948 --> 00:34:35,069
[SPEAKER_19]: The monitor's gone.

421
00:34:35,869 --> 00:34:36,089
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

422
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:41,212
[SPEAKER_17]: You know... I don't know.

423
00:34:41,232 --> 00:34:42,452
[SPEAKER_17]: They should, like, ghetto rig it.

424
00:34:46,114 --> 00:34:47,374
[SPEAKER_19]: Pimp my 2DX machine.

425
00:34:50,256 --> 00:34:52,857
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, what was that idea for a TV show you were talking about earlier this week?

426
00:34:52,877 --> 00:34:53,657
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought it was kind of cool.

427
00:34:53,697 --> 00:34:54,598
[SPEAKER_19]: Pimp my rig...

428
00:34:57,358 --> 00:34:58,438
[SPEAKER_17]: And what would happen on this show?

429
00:34:59,118 --> 00:35:02,299
[SPEAKER_17]: They would take someone's piece of shit computer and they'd make it pretty.

430
00:35:03,379 --> 00:35:04,379
[SPEAKER_17]: And they'd case mod it.

431
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:06,800
[SPEAKER_17]: Kind of what you did to Christopher's computer this week.

432
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,660
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, that's just building a computer.

433
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,700
[SPEAKER_17]: But yeah, more or less.

434
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:16,681
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just, um, I could see G4 doing this because they're retarded and want to rip off ideas from people, so why not?

435
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:25,503
[SPEAKER_19]: Our show's come to a halt because I'm trying to give Jamie chocolate right now.

436
00:35:27,527 --> 00:35:29,007
[SPEAKER_19]: Gotta get your priorities in straight.

437
00:35:31,368 --> 00:35:32,049
[SPEAKER_11]: Chocolate first.

438
00:35:33,369 --> 00:35:35,990
[SPEAKER_19]: Legend of Zaku says he needs someone to pimp his PA skills.

439
00:35:38,431 --> 00:35:39,192
[SPEAKER_19]: Practice, practice.

440
00:35:39,992 --> 00:35:40,612
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what it takes.

441
00:35:41,453 --> 00:35:51,057
[SPEAKER_19]: If you want to join our chatroom and make random comments that we might read on air, join our chatroom, www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on chat, and it's lots of fun.

442
00:35:52,103 --> 00:35:55,086
[SPEAKER_19]: El Mullet made it funny.

443
00:35:55,947 --> 00:35:58,730
[SPEAKER_19]: He says once they pimp it, they could call it an apple.

444
00:36:02,555 --> 00:36:03,235
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I'm sorry.

445
00:36:03,315 --> 00:36:08,801
[SPEAKER_17]: They're not removing all functionality out of it or replacing the innards with a toaster.

446
00:36:10,743 --> 00:36:13,186
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember the old GeForce, the transparent toasters.

447
00:36:13,406 --> 00:36:13,987
[SPEAKER_17]: Those are great.

448
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:18,578
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, we're going to go to a break.

449
00:36:18,598 --> 00:36:22,059
[SPEAKER_19]: When we come back from this break, I guess we'll talk about some DDR stuff.

450
00:36:22,899 --> 00:36:25,760
[SPEAKER_19]: There's some stuff going on in the Babani scene this week, and I suppose we can talk about it.

451
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,141
[SPEAKER_19]: Might as well.

452
00:36:28,281 --> 00:36:30,281
[SPEAKER_19]: In this break, what?

453
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:36,643
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh yeah, and Jamie has this really random Castlevania thing she wants to share with you guys, so we'll hook that up for later.

454
00:36:37,783 --> 00:36:43,665
[SPEAKER_19]: In this break, we're going to play some PlayStation 2DX songs, because I want to hear Cracker.

455
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,896
[SPEAKER_19]: So we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio

456
00:38:39,138 --> 00:38:41,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

457
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,181
Lens Flasher and Destroyer

458
00:41:55,114 --> 00:41:56,457
and Torture and Destroy.

459
00:44:30,795 --> 00:44:36,660
[SPEAKER_22]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

460
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,883
[SPEAKER_07]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and Jamie...

461
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:47,780
[SPEAKER_19]: wants to do something for you guys here.

462
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,001
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a little bit random.

463
00:44:49,041 --> 00:44:54,364
[SPEAKER_19]: It doesn't really have to do with Bomani per se, but turn on the satanic music we've got there in the background.

464
00:44:54,384 --> 00:44:55,044
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not satanic.

465
00:44:55,124 --> 00:44:55,824
[SPEAKER_11]: It's churchy.

466
00:44:55,845 --> 00:44:56,945
[SPEAKER_19]: It sounds satanic to me.

467
00:44:57,065 --> 00:44:58,726
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm actually feeling better now that I stand up.

468
00:44:59,086 --> 00:44:59,446
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, that's good.

469
00:44:59,567 --> 00:45:03,569
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, we've always made fun of Castlevania Symphony of the Night before the bad voice acting.

470
00:45:03,689 --> 00:45:05,970
[SPEAKER_19]: Right, and this has to do with the podcast from last week.

471
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:07,891
[SPEAKER_19]: This kind of relates into the podcast.

472
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:10,533
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you listen to it, you'd know what we were talking about.

473
00:45:10,573 --> 00:45:10,953
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

474
00:45:10,973 --> 00:45:12,073
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the plug I was going to make.

475
00:45:12,434 --> 00:45:14,695
[SPEAKER_19]: If you haven't checked out the podcast yet...

476
00:45:15,242 --> 00:45:15,662
[SPEAKER_19]: Do it!

477
00:45:16,163 --> 00:45:18,805
[SPEAKER_19]: www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on Orange Lounge Radio to go.

478
00:45:19,065 --> 00:45:26,530
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a whole extra 20-minute show that we do, and we talk about random shit like this, such as the voice acting in Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

479
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:28,832
[SPEAKER_19]: And a lot of you guys have played this game.

480
00:45:29,012 --> 00:45:30,713
[SPEAKER_19]: God, this song scares the shit out of me.

481
00:45:32,514 --> 00:45:37,578
[SPEAKER_19]: A lot of you... Listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

482
00:45:38,218 --> 00:45:38,899
[SPEAKER_19]: It is holy.

483
00:45:40,245 --> 00:45:41,206
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I didn't know it was going through.

484
00:45:41,226 --> 00:45:41,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's already going through.

485
00:45:41,987 --> 00:45:42,367
[SPEAKER_19]: They can hear it.

486
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:45,129
[SPEAKER_19]: The holiest of internet radio.

487
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:45,610
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway.

488
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:46,630
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to go ahead and get started playing.

489
00:45:46,811 --> 00:45:47,011
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

490
00:45:47,551 --> 00:45:52,475
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know the bad voice acting in Symphony of the Night is like, Die, monster.

491
00:45:52,996 --> 00:45:54,157
[SPEAKER_19]: You don't belong in this world.

492
00:45:54,737 --> 00:45:55,278
[SPEAKER_19]: It's really lame.

493
00:45:55,538 --> 00:46:01,603
[SPEAKER_19]: So anyway, Jamie said she wanted to play for you all how much better the Japanese voice acting is.

494
00:46:02,418 --> 00:46:03,999
[SPEAKER_19]: So she's going to do that for you guys.

495
00:46:04,299 --> 00:46:05,539
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, this is the cool thing.

496
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:19,466
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're listening live on Sunday night, which I know obviously right now you are, but some of you guys hear this show on the rebroadcast over on DDR Freak Radio and all that stuff, you can actually see it on our webcam, www.orangehornsradio.com.

497
00:46:20,751 --> 00:46:28,155
[SPEAKER_11]: I would appreciate it, however, though, if people save copies of them, I will put this up somewhere for people to see the images.

498
00:46:28,475 --> 00:46:34,399
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, Misty is our usual webcam whore, and she's not here tonight, so hopefully somebody else is saving pictures.

499
00:46:34,919 --> 00:46:37,961
[SPEAKER_11]: Save the pictures, and after the show, I'll give you my email address.

500
00:46:43,103 --> 00:46:44,024
[SPEAKER_27]: One gay man.

501
00:46:45,152 --> 00:46:48,873
[SPEAKER_27]: One angsty woman and one angry man.

502
00:46:49,533 --> 00:46:51,273
[SPEAKER_27]: Orange Lounge Radio.

503
00:46:51,513 --> 00:46:52,233
[SPEAKER_11]: Coming to a theater near you.

504
00:46:52,253 --> 00:46:52,853
[SPEAKER_11]: I see the story on here.

505
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,674
[SPEAKER_11]: You know how they give you the whole story?

506
00:46:55,234 --> 00:46:57,274
[SPEAKER_11]: It actually is different, but it's still written in English.

507
00:46:58,314 --> 00:47:03,615
[SPEAKER_11]: But they say it as your... Okay.

508
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:06,416
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, you actually have to play the game for a little bit to get to the opening.

509
00:47:06,836 --> 00:47:09,076
[SPEAKER_19]: You just wanted to play games on Orange Lounge Radio.

510
00:47:12,237 --> 00:47:13,517
[SPEAKER_19]: Isn't this an Akira Yamaoka track?

511
00:47:15,174 --> 00:47:15,494
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

512
00:47:18,116 --> 00:47:23,419
[SPEAKER_19]: Isn't this great?

513
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:30,524
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys are tuned into an internet radio station, and you're not even watching somebody play games.

514
00:47:30,584 --> 00:47:31,165
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, here we go.

515
00:47:31,225 --> 00:47:31,745
[SPEAKER_14]: Destroy!

516
00:47:32,706 --> 00:47:34,107
[SPEAKER_13]: This is not the world you live in!

517
00:47:34,247 --> 00:47:38,529
[SPEAKER_13]: I will not be revived by my own power.

518
00:47:38,549 --> 00:47:39,910
[SPEAKER_13]: I will be revived by greedy humans.

519
00:47:45,353 --> 00:47:47,214
[SPEAKER_13]: Power is the only justice.

520
00:47:47,274 --> 00:47:49,275
[SPEAKER_13]: That's your own way of saying it.

521
00:47:49,295 --> 00:47:53,297
[SPEAKER_14]: People seek each other under the same belief, unite, and walk.

522
00:47:53,357 --> 00:48:02,242
[SPEAKER_13]: However, humans have developed by desire, and have been defeated by faith.

523
00:48:02,262 --> 00:48:07,024
[SPEAKER_13]: Humans cannot be defeated by power alone.

524
00:48:07,204 --> 00:48:07,665
[SPEAKER_13]: Uyamae,

525
00:48:15,157 --> 00:48:16,558
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow, that was very scary.

526
00:48:16,618 --> 00:48:22,940
[SPEAKER_14]: And now you're doing the little battle in the beginning, right?

527
00:48:36,124 --> 00:48:37,485
[SPEAKER_19]: I recognize one part.

528
00:48:37,785 --> 00:48:38,505
[SPEAKER_19]: I recognize one part.

529
00:48:38,685 --> 00:48:40,286
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's when the little glass breaks.

530
00:48:40,826 --> 00:48:42,447
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I remember that in the English version.

531
00:48:42,807 --> 00:48:43,668
[SPEAKER_19]: What is a man?

532
00:48:43,688 --> 00:48:46,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Oops.

533
00:48:46,609 --> 00:48:49,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh.

534
00:48:53,512 --> 00:48:54,373
[SPEAKER_19]: How cool he says what?

535
00:48:56,174 --> 00:48:56,794
[SPEAKER_19]: Hydro Storm.

536
00:49:07,146 --> 00:49:08,147
That was very hot.

537
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:29,492
[SPEAKER_19]: Symphony of the Night is like the sex... I mean, I know this isn't Symphony of the Night, but I'm used to Symphony of the Night.

538
00:49:29,792 --> 00:49:31,692
[SPEAKER_19]: It has the sexiest music.

539
00:49:31,912 --> 00:49:33,233
[SPEAKER_19]: God, the music is so good.

540
00:49:33,353 --> 00:49:36,434
[SPEAKER_14]: Translation, because they changed it.

541
00:49:36,734 --> 00:49:44,557
[SPEAKER_11]: After a series of epic battles, Richter Velma finally succeeded in destroying Count Dracula, the ancient vampire who had been the most recently resurrected by the Dark Priest Shaft.

542
00:49:44,997 --> 00:49:49,559
[SPEAKER_11]: However, one night, four years later, under the bright glare of the moon, Richter mysteriously vanished.

543
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:52,880
[SPEAKER_11]: With no idea of where to begin her search, Maria Renard set out to look for him.

544
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:54,541
[SPEAKER_11]: It was then that fate intervened.

545
00:49:55,051 --> 00:50:01,936
[SPEAKER_11]: Castlevania, The Castle of Dracula, which is rumored to appear only once every century, suddenly and mysteriously materialized.

546
00:50:01,976 --> 00:50:03,197
[SPEAKER_11]: More text.

547
00:50:03,277 --> 00:50:06,480
[SPEAKER_11]: Meanwhile, powerful forces were at work in the life of a man named Alucard.

548
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:10,943
[SPEAKER_11]: The very same Alucard who had previously teamed up with Ralph C. Belmont

549
00:50:11,683 --> 00:50:15,344
[SPEAKER_11]: to destroy his immortal father, Vlad Tepesov, aka Count Dracula.

550
00:50:15,944 --> 00:50:22,366
[SPEAKER_11]: Alucard, in order to rid the world of his own first bloodline, sealed off his powers and entered into what was supposed to be an eternal slumber.

551
00:50:24,726 --> 00:50:26,687
[SPEAKER_11]: At the end of this is the line that they pissed off that they changed.

552
00:50:27,227 --> 00:50:32,768
[SPEAKER_11]: But now that sleep had been disturbed, Alucard is aware of the evil that has once again arisen in his homeland.

553
00:50:33,028 --> 00:50:37,150
[SPEAKER_11]: The time has come once more for the forces of good and evil to engage in their ancient battle.

554
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:38,830
[SPEAKER_11]: Dracula's castle beckons for you.

555
00:50:39,497 --> 00:50:42,679
[SPEAKER_11]: and perhaps none but that bright and glaring moon can say who will triumph.

556
00:50:42,859 --> 00:50:43,900
[SPEAKER_11]: They changed that line.

557
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:44,741
[SPEAKER_11]: That pissed me off.

558
00:50:44,761 --> 00:50:45,901
[SPEAKER_11]: That was so awesome.

559
00:50:45,981 --> 00:50:47,642
[SPEAKER_19]: This is just like watching Iron Chef.

560
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:51,905
[SPEAKER_20]: And the secret ingredient?

561
00:50:52,185 --> 00:50:52,786
[SPEAKER_19]: Potato!

562
00:50:54,747 --> 00:50:55,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me bite this pepper.

563
00:50:58,489 --> 00:51:00,831
[SPEAKER_11]: And it says Dracula X. That's so awesome.

564
00:51:02,572 --> 00:51:06,074
[SPEAKER_11]: This is actually supposed to be on the 32X.

565
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:10,836
[SPEAKER_11]: You know?

566
00:51:10,996 --> 00:51:11,316
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

567
00:51:12,257 --> 00:51:12,517
[SPEAKER_17]: Lovely.

568
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:23,126
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, all I gotta say is, uh... Who's the man?

569
00:51:23,587 --> 00:51:25,628
[SPEAKER_20]: The resurrected Dracula?

570
00:51:26,329 --> 00:51:26,769
[SPEAKER_20]: Shit!

571
00:51:29,111 --> 00:51:29,892
[SPEAKER_20]: Can you dig it?

572
00:51:30,833 --> 00:51:31,533
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, yeah.

573
00:51:34,896 --> 00:51:36,017
[SPEAKER_20]: You're a dumbass.

574
00:51:37,638 --> 00:51:38,259
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, alright.

575
00:51:39,762 --> 00:51:40,242
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway.

576
00:51:40,262 --> 00:51:45,345
[SPEAKER_19]: Gave me just one excuse to play video games during the show.

577
00:51:46,485 --> 00:51:46,785
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

578
00:51:48,066 --> 00:51:48,986
[SPEAKER_19]: That was pretty cool, though.

579
00:51:49,066 --> 00:51:51,347
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd actually never heard that, the Japanese version.

580
00:51:51,507 --> 00:51:54,309
[SPEAKER_19]: I think maybe you sent me bits and pieces, like on Wave.

581
00:51:54,909 --> 00:51:59,511
[SPEAKER_11]: I had a file of Alucard, though, because I figured we wouldn't be getting to the part with Alucard, so I brought a file with him.

582
00:52:00,071 --> 00:52:02,192
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you want me to play that little Wave sample?

583
00:52:03,073 --> 00:52:03,693
[SPEAKER_11]: In just a sec.

584
00:52:03,873 --> 00:52:04,133
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

585
00:52:05,674 --> 00:52:06,294
[SPEAKER_19]: A little bit there.

586
00:52:07,655 --> 00:52:07,795
Ugh.

587
00:52:11,055 --> 00:52:13,376
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll be talking about Bomani News at some point this evening, too.

588
00:52:13,416 --> 00:52:15,718
[SPEAKER_19]: But let's face it, you know, there hasn't been a new game lately.

589
00:52:15,778 --> 00:52:17,519
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, actually, there was a big new game this week.

590
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,561
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't really have an excuse to not be talking Bomani.

591
00:52:23,722 --> 00:52:24,603
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll get to it, though.

592
00:52:24,623 --> 00:52:25,243
[SPEAKER_19]: We will, we will.

593
00:52:27,464 --> 00:52:32,147
[SPEAKER_19]: Of course, Castlevania, I mean, a lot of you guys that play DDR, I know a lot of you guys are into Castlevania, too.

594
00:52:32,167 --> 00:52:33,128
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you're not, you should be.

595
00:52:33,368 --> 00:52:35,649
[SPEAKER_19]: Because the music's good, the gameplay's good.

596
00:52:35,789 --> 00:52:36,330
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, yes, Jamie.

597
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:37,090
[SPEAKER_11]: The file of Alucard?

598
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:37,550
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

599
00:52:38,411 --> 00:52:38,891
[SPEAKER_19]: You want it now?

600
00:52:39,171 --> 00:52:39,351
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

601
00:52:40,092 --> 00:52:40,352
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is.

602
00:52:42,042 --> 00:52:44,503
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.

603
00:52:45,103 --> 00:52:55,310
[SPEAKER_00]: But see, isn't the voice acting better?

604
00:52:56,090 --> 00:53:00,233
[SPEAKER_19]: But see, there's something about the American voice acting that's very charming.

605
00:53:00,653 --> 00:53:01,633
[SPEAKER_11]: Die, monster!

606
00:53:01,794 --> 00:53:03,354
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't belong in this world!

607
00:53:03,655 --> 00:53:04,135
[SPEAKER_11]: It's cute.

608
00:53:04,155 --> 00:53:05,876
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, excuse me, Richter.

609
00:53:12,453 --> 00:53:13,133
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, boy, oh, boy.

610
00:53:14,394 --> 00:53:14,754
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

611
00:53:15,855 --> 00:53:18,717
[SPEAKER_19]: Loki's going to hook the webcam back up so you can stare at the couch again.

612
00:53:19,037 --> 00:53:19,958
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to check on my laundry.

613
00:53:20,178 --> 00:53:20,498
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

614
00:53:20,538 --> 00:53:23,220
[SPEAKER_19]: Meanwhile, we're going to talk a little bit about some Bomani news.

615
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:26,442
[SPEAKER_19]: There actually was a little bit of news this week, and we can talk about that.

616
00:53:27,443 --> 00:53:28,264
[SPEAKER_19]: This isn't Bomani.

617
00:53:28,324 --> 00:53:30,465
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, I'll talk about the Castlevania thing real fast.

618
00:53:30,846 --> 00:53:34,708
[SPEAKER_19]: But you know that Konami was making this big announcement on Thursday.

619
00:53:35,088 --> 00:53:37,210
[SPEAKER_19]: They were going to make a big announcement on January 27th, right?

620
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:37,370
[SPEAKER_19]: Well...

621
00:53:40,379 --> 00:53:43,561
[SPEAKER_19]: It turned out that the big announcement was just their 2005 lineup.

622
00:53:43,741 --> 00:53:46,363
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, you can see all the new Konami games that are coming out in 2005.

623
00:53:47,464 --> 00:53:57,630
[SPEAKER_19]: And, of course, as suspected, and if you were paying attention to OrangeLawnRadio.com throughout the week, you already knew this, but one of the games they announced was Castlevania Curse of Darkness, which is going to be a brand new PlayStation 2 title.

624
00:53:58,550 --> 00:53:58,950
[SPEAKER_19]: Very cool.

625
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:01,232
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's in addition to the DS Castlevania game.

626
00:54:01,493 --> 00:54:03,014
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's going to be a big year for Castlevania.

627
00:54:03,054 --> 00:54:03,774
[SPEAKER_19]: That's going to be cool.

628
00:54:04,095 --> 00:54:05,276
[SPEAKER_19]: And then they announced some other games.

629
00:54:05,456 --> 00:54:06,997
[SPEAKER_19]: Ninja Turtles game is in there.

630
00:54:08,138 --> 00:54:08,779
[SPEAKER_19]: What else was there?

631
00:54:08,819 --> 00:54:13,002
[SPEAKER_19]: There was a new Frogger game.

632
00:54:13,102 --> 00:54:15,244
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, and of course, Metal Gear Acid for the PSP.

633
00:54:15,284 --> 00:54:16,165
[SPEAKER_19]: We all knew that was coming.

634
00:54:16,685 --> 00:54:17,886
[SPEAKER_19]: So they announced all these games.

635
00:54:18,847 --> 00:54:22,570
[SPEAKER_19]: And then what was weird is that the same day, the exact same day,

636
00:54:23,346 --> 00:54:26,548
[SPEAKER_19]: in unrelated news, but they put out a press release on this.

637
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:29,509
[SPEAKER_19]: They did not announce any new DDR titles.

638
00:54:29,549 --> 00:54:31,610
[SPEAKER_19]: They did not announce any Extreme 2.

639
00:54:31,971 --> 00:54:33,871
[SPEAKER_19]: They did not announce Ultramix 3.

640
00:54:34,212 --> 00:54:37,153
[SPEAKER_19]: They didn't announce DDR with Mario for the US.

641
00:54:37,173 --> 00:54:38,374
[SPEAKER_19]: They didn't announce any of that stuff.

642
00:54:38,854 --> 00:54:44,957
[SPEAKER_19]: But what they did do is that they published this press release saying, Hey, guess what, kids?

643
00:54:45,497 --> 00:54:51,541
[SPEAKER_19]: Dance Dance Revolution sold 1.2 million copies in North America in 2004.

644
00:54:53,382 --> 00:55:02,185
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, that's across all titles, so we're talking Extreme and Ultramix 2 combined, along with Ultramix 1 and Max 2.

645
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:11,289
[SPEAKER_19]: All those combined, all those sales totaled 1.2 million, but really, for a game that requires an additional peripheral to play, not too shabby.

646
00:55:11,749 --> 00:55:14,610
[SPEAKER_19]: Certainly higher sales than any Power Pad game ever got, right?

647
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:16,791
[SPEAKER_19]: So that was 1.2 million copies in 2004.

648
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:33,120
[SPEAKER_19]: since DDR debuted in 2001 all the way back on Dance Dance Revolution on the Playstation 2.5 million copies of DDR games for the home consoles in the US sold not too shabby right?

649
00:55:34,585 --> 00:55:37,787
[SPEAKER_19]: But then they didn't announce a new DDR game to go along with that.

650
00:55:37,827 --> 00:55:40,088
[SPEAKER_19]: They just said, gee, isn't DDR great?

651
00:55:40,468 --> 00:55:42,149
[SPEAKER_19]: But honestly, think about it, people.

652
00:55:42,529 --> 00:55:49,834
[SPEAKER_19]: Are they going to submit this press release and then say, oh, and by the way, because of DDR's great success, no more DDR games in the U.S.

653
00:55:49,914 --> 00:55:50,394
[SPEAKER_19]: It's done.

654
00:55:50,654 --> 00:55:51,955
[SPEAKER_19]: We're pulling the plug on DDR.

655
00:55:52,435 --> 00:55:53,716
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going out on the top.

656
00:55:53,796 --> 00:55:54,136
[SPEAKER_19]: That's right.

657
00:55:54,616 --> 00:55:59,239
[SPEAKER_19]: We're like a TV sitcom like Friends or something.

658
00:55:59,259 --> 00:56:01,120
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to go out while we're still on top.

659
00:56:02,506 --> 00:56:03,747
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think so, boys and girls.

660
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:05,027
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not quite how it works.

661
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:14,072
[SPEAKER_19]: You can bet your sweet ass that we will see new games on PlayStation and Xbox this year, and we will probably see that GameCube game as well.

662
00:56:14,252 --> 00:56:16,333
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's just a foregone conclusion.

663
00:56:16,713 --> 00:56:21,255
[SPEAKER_19]: We just have to sit here and twiddle our thumbs until the details are announced, which probably won't be until E3.

664
00:56:23,236 --> 00:56:23,577
[SPEAKER_19]: Honestly.

665
00:56:24,017 --> 00:56:24,537
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's that.

666
00:56:25,598 --> 00:56:26,718
[SPEAKER_19]: Anything you want to add to that, Loki?

667
00:56:27,318 --> 00:56:28,279
[SPEAKER_19]: What's a GameCube?

668
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:30,400
[SPEAKER_19]: Smartass.

669
00:56:33,726 --> 00:56:35,087
[SPEAKER_19]: Jamie, anything you want to add to that?

670
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:39,490
[SPEAKER_15]: Aren't you excited about new DDRM consoles?

671
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:42,612
[SPEAKER_15]: I am, if I... Yeah, I am.

672
00:56:43,052 --> 00:56:43,933
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, this is what I'm thinking.

673
00:56:44,253 --> 00:56:49,057
[SPEAKER_19]: How many copies of a video game do you think it would take to sell to call it a success?

674
00:56:50,418 --> 00:56:53,440
[SPEAKER_19]: A success... How many copies does a successful video game sell?

675
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:54,440
[SPEAKER_19]: Two.

676
00:56:55,401 --> 00:56:55,721
[SPEAKER_19]: Come on.

677
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:56,742
[SPEAKER_19]: Like 100,000?

678
00:56:56,782 --> 00:56:57,062
[SPEAKER_19]: That's decent.

679
00:56:57,082 --> 00:56:58,943
[SPEAKER_11]: 100,000 would be really decent, right?

680
00:56:58,963 --> 00:56:59,043
[SPEAKER_19]: Now...

681
00:57:01,858 --> 00:57:24,553
[SPEAKER_19]: If one out of every ten people that bought DDR 2004 were to support a, I don't know, another music game that Konami would put out, say, Beatmania 2DX, if you could convince one out of every ten people that bought DDR that Beatmania 2DX is a good idea, one out of every ten, you'd have a successful game on your hands.

682
00:57:25,194 --> 00:57:31,218
[SPEAKER_17]: If you could say, convince those same one out of ten people to, I don't know, say support an online,

683
00:57:32,614 --> 00:57:37,058
[SPEAKER_17]: Music game related radio show, we would be rich.

684
00:57:41,161 --> 00:57:42,062
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I know, I know.

685
00:57:42,962 --> 00:57:43,603
[SPEAKER_19]: Man can dream.

686
00:57:44,143 --> 00:57:51,049
[SPEAKER_19]: Whereas the figure is actually more like one out of every million actually support that internet.

687
00:57:51,089 --> 00:57:52,170
[SPEAKER_19]: Because that would make it what, two?

688
00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:53,751
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that's about how many listeners we have, two.

689
00:57:57,344 --> 00:57:57,644
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

690
00:57:58,784 --> 00:58:17,749
[SPEAKER_19]: And everyone else is expecting to hear Tomosuke and the rest of the Orange Lounge Radio band because they think that this shows... You know, there's been so many people out there that have actually thought that Orange Lounge Radio is related to Orange Lounge that we finally put a disclaimer on the website at the very, very bottom in little text.

691
00:58:17,989 --> 00:58:18,309
[SPEAKER_19]: Note.

692
00:58:19,109 --> 00:58:24,070
[SPEAKER_19]: Orange Lounge Radio is not affiliated with Orange Lounge the band from DDR and 2DX and all that.

693
00:58:26,291 --> 00:58:26,631
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry.

694
00:58:28,108 --> 00:58:29,590
[SPEAKER_19]: Tomosuke does have his own site.

695
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:30,250
[SPEAKER_19]: It's out there.

696
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:31,891
[SPEAKER_19]: We had a link to it once.

697
00:58:33,072 --> 00:58:37,356
[SPEAKER_19]: Just put Orange Lounge into Google and it's the site that comes up before Orange Lounge Radio.

698
00:58:37,916 --> 00:58:38,096
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

699
00:58:39,638 --> 00:58:42,720
[SPEAKER_11]: Before I let my pet peeve bug me anymore, it's Tomosuke.

700
00:58:43,341 --> 00:58:43,601
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry.

701
00:58:45,662 --> 00:58:46,023
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm white.

702
00:58:48,345 --> 00:58:48,665
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

703
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:52,219
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know why.

704
00:58:52,299 --> 00:58:57,981
[SPEAKER_19]: I know a lot of people have this fear that if they bring out 2DX in America, it's going to be fucked up.

705
00:58:58,581 --> 00:58:59,761
[SPEAKER_19]: But I kind of don't care.

706
00:58:59,921 --> 00:59:01,341
[SPEAKER_19]: I just really want them to do it.

707
00:59:03,042 --> 00:59:07,343
[SPEAKER_19]: Even if it isn't as good as 2DX 7th, 8th, 9th style that's coming out soon.

708
00:59:07,643 --> 00:59:10,744
[SPEAKER_19]: Even if it's not that good, give us some new songs.

709
00:59:10,824 --> 00:59:11,784
[SPEAKER_19]: Give us something.

710
00:59:12,504 --> 00:59:13,604
[SPEAKER_19]: Something to make it US.

711
00:59:14,104 --> 00:59:14,765
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd be happy.

712
00:59:14,825 --> 00:59:17,025
[SPEAKER_19]: A lot of people would be very, very happy if you do it.

713
00:59:18,746 --> 00:59:19,386
[SPEAKER_19]: That's my plea.

714
00:59:19,846 --> 00:59:20,326
[SPEAKER_19]: What can you do?

715
00:59:23,934 --> 00:59:24,254
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

716
00:59:25,235 --> 00:59:29,717
[SPEAKER_19]: Any other comments on Beatmania 2DX USA and the hopes and dreams of seeing it happen?

717
00:59:29,737 --> 00:59:30,317
[SPEAKER_19]: We wish, we wish.

718
00:59:30,678 --> 00:59:30,958
[SPEAKER_19]: I know.

719
00:59:32,178 --> 00:59:33,639
[SPEAKER_19]: Not gonna happen, but whatever.

720
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:35,960
[SPEAKER_19]: See, now Jamie... Listen up, pessimist.

721
00:59:36,461 --> 00:59:41,003
[SPEAKER_19]: Jamie, you usually prefer the Japanese mixes to American mixes, usually.

722
00:59:41,483 --> 00:59:41,964
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.

723
00:59:42,544 --> 00:59:45,406
[SPEAKER_19]: But you still would want to see a 2DX US mix.

724
00:59:45,686 --> 00:59:46,166
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.

725
00:59:46,266 --> 00:59:46,446
[SPEAKER_19]: Why?

726
00:59:47,247 --> 00:59:48,227
[SPEAKER_11]: Just to have it out here.

727
00:59:49,088 --> 00:59:51,109
[SPEAKER_19]: Another 2DX game to waste my money on, exactly.

728
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:51,589
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously.

729
00:59:52,748 --> 00:59:54,549
[SPEAKER_19]: I still have to find a copy of Fourth Style somewhere.

730
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:00,091
[SPEAKER_19]: And I understand what they're saying in the chatroom there.

731
01:00:00,111 --> 01:00:04,012
[SPEAKER_19]: They're saying, if you were to bring 2DX to the US, it would have to appeal to the US gamers.

732
01:00:05,112 --> 01:00:10,234
[SPEAKER_19]: You only have to appeal to one out of every ten people that bought DDR last year to make this game a success.

733
01:00:10,274 --> 01:00:11,095
[SPEAKER_19]: That's all I'm saying.

734
01:00:13,195 --> 01:00:14,776
[SPEAKER_19]: One out of every ten should not be that hard.

735
01:00:15,216 --> 01:00:19,838
[SPEAKER_19]: If Donkey Konga can be a success, 2DX can be a success.

736
01:00:19,898 --> 01:00:20,338
[SPEAKER_19]: You know it.

737
01:00:23,277 --> 01:00:24,077
[SPEAKER_19]: I know this in my heart.

738
01:00:24,318 --> 01:00:33,822
[SPEAKER_19]: A lot of 2DX elitists I'm not saying everybody that plays 2DX is a 2DX elitist but a lot of 2DX elitists out there would have you believe that the masses don't want to eat up a game like 2DX.

739
01:00:35,843 --> 01:00:42,547
[SPEAKER_19]: But whenever I play 2DX in the arcades there's always these people that stand around kind of watching going ooh ah just like with DDR.

740
01:00:43,447 --> 01:00:45,288
[SPEAKER_19]: It's got a lot of that same appeal to it.

741
01:00:46,969 --> 01:00:47,309
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

742
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:49,130
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll see.

743
01:00:50,891 --> 01:00:52,372
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to take a break.

744
01:00:52,392 --> 01:00:52,932
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll be back

745
01:00:54,229 --> 01:00:54,549
[SPEAKER_19]: Allie Japan

746
01:01:23,059 --> 01:01:25,093
[SPEAKER_19]: And we'll be back after this.

747
01:01:59,781 --> 01:02:01,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

748
01:04:09,703 --> 01:04:10,950
You gotta move it, move it now

749
01:05:26,409 --> 01:05:27,971
Thank you for watching!

750
01:05:53,229 --> 01:05:53,791
Thanks for watching!

751
01:07:05,715 --> 01:07:06,739
Thanks for watching!

752
01:07:54,935 --> 01:07:58,459
[SPEAKER_19]: Whoops, forgot to queue up a promo there that says we're coming back.

753
01:07:58,579 --> 01:07:59,000
[SPEAKER_19]: My bad.

754
01:08:01,843 --> 01:08:03,085
[SPEAKER_19]: Let me put something up there.

755
01:08:10,270 --> 01:08:18,876
[SPEAKER_26]: Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.

756
01:08:18,917 --> 01:08:24,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

757
01:08:25,902 --> 01:08:26,422
[SPEAKER_19]: There we go.

758
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:28,444
[SPEAKER_19]: Now we can come back.

759
01:08:29,024 --> 01:08:29,785
[SPEAKER_19]: Hello, boys and girls.

760
01:08:33,163 --> 01:08:36,486
[SPEAKER_19]: You know the DDR Freak was down earlier this evening, but it's back up now.

761
01:08:36,646 --> 01:08:38,007
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess they were having some server problems.

762
01:08:38,328 --> 01:08:41,451
[SPEAKER_19]: DDR Freak was down, and then didn't you try to get on Bomani Style, and they were down too?

763
01:08:41,891 --> 01:08:42,932
[SPEAKER_19]: Everybody's broken!

764
01:08:43,713 --> 01:08:44,473
[SPEAKER_19]: They all broke!

765
01:08:47,436 --> 01:08:47,916
[SPEAKER_19]: What can you do?

766
01:08:48,697 --> 01:08:52,300
[SPEAKER_19]: But now the DDR Freak is back up.

767
01:08:53,561 --> 01:08:56,704
[SPEAKER_19]: I went over to the Mod of the Month thread, and I voted for Jamie.

768
01:08:57,445 --> 01:08:58,466
[SPEAKER_19]: I voted for you for Mod of the Month.

769
01:08:58,820 --> 01:08:59,181
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

770
01:08:59,361 --> 01:09:00,283
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going to win.

771
01:09:00,524 --> 01:09:02,849
[SPEAKER_19]: I know you're not because a bunch of people went in there and flooded for somebody else.

772
01:09:03,189 --> 01:09:03,811
[SPEAKER_19]: But that's okay.

773
01:09:03,831 --> 01:09:04,873
[SPEAKER_19]: You should still vote for Jamie.

774
01:09:06,156 --> 01:09:06,436
[SPEAKER_19]: Do it.

775
01:09:06,777 --> 01:09:07,038
[SPEAKER_19]: Do it.

776
01:09:08,721 --> 01:09:08,962
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

777
01:09:10,529 --> 01:09:16,492
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, I was asked to pass along our buddy Explicit, who's usually here at the show.

778
01:09:16,592 --> 01:09:18,193
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, he has a lot of FUs.

779
01:09:18,513 --> 01:09:29,399
[SPEAKER_19]: He sent along a little private message to me over on Orange Lounge Radio, and he wanted me to share some stuff with you guys about the upcoming tournament that's happening on, what, Saturday?

780
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:31,420
[SPEAKER_19]: This Saturday, Saturday, February 5th.

781
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:32,921
[SPEAKER_19]: Piss is happening this Saturday.

782
01:09:32,941 --> 01:09:33,661
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm so excited.

783
01:09:34,242 --> 01:09:35,823
[SPEAKER_19]: Paradise Island, SmackDown Sackdown...

784
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:42,601
[SPEAKER_17]: If I have a lot to drink tonight, piss might happen even earlier.

785
01:09:45,622 --> 01:09:50,763
[SPEAKER_19]: The Paradise Island Sacktown Smackdown is happening this Saturday, February 5th.

786
01:09:51,824 --> 01:09:53,904
[SPEAKER_19]: And they're going to have the P.A.

787
01:09:53,964 --> 01:09:56,345
[SPEAKER_19]: and Demonium, like Pan-Demonium, get it?

788
01:09:56,385 --> 01:09:56,865
[SPEAKER_19]: P.A.

789
01:09:56,985 --> 01:09:57,545
[SPEAKER_19]: and Demonium?

790
01:09:57,625 --> 01:09:58,086
[SPEAKER_19]: Pan-Demonium?

791
01:09:58,766 --> 01:10:00,006
[SPEAKER_19]: That's their version of Perfect Attack.

792
01:10:00,646 --> 01:10:03,867
[SPEAKER_19]: And they're going to have a Showstopper Freestyle Contest, that should be fun.

793
01:10:04,187 --> 01:10:09,109
[SPEAKER_19]: And, get your rice rockets ready, an initial D Grand Prix.

794
01:10:10,222 --> 01:10:11,823
[SPEAKER_19]: Joy and joy, that should be fun.

795
01:10:12,023 --> 01:10:13,183
[SPEAKER_17]: Golden showers for all.

796
01:10:19,805 --> 01:10:22,707
[SPEAKER_19]: Explicit asked me to pass along some updates to the tournament.

797
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:26,288
[SPEAKER_19]: They've actually lowered some of the prices, which is nice.

798
01:10:26,548 --> 01:10:34,871
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you were thinking about it, they've actually lowered the price to get into freestyle and try to pull up the latest update.

799
01:10:37,021 --> 01:10:42,963
[SPEAKER_19]: And let's see, freestyle price has been reduced to $10, only $8 if you're pre-registered.

800
01:10:43,363 --> 01:10:52,626
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you want to pre-register, go to DDR Freak, now that it's back up, go to DDR Tournament Chat, or whatever that forum's called, and look for the Paradise Island thread.

801
01:10:52,646 --> 01:11:00,408
[SPEAKER_19]: And yes, I know that's a local tournament, so those of you guys on the East Coast probably are not feasibly going to be going to this, but I did promise we would put that little local plug.

802
01:11:01,669 --> 01:11:05,030
[SPEAKER_19]: And at some point during the tournament, I do plan on making a cameo.

803
01:11:06,721 --> 01:11:08,683
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm gonna dabble in the piss for a little bit.

804
01:11:10,184 --> 01:11:11,245
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you gonna get your hands wet?

805
01:11:11,265 --> 01:11:13,247
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm gonna get my hands wet at piss.

806
01:11:14,688 --> 01:11:15,288
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, we'll stop.

807
01:11:15,468 --> 01:11:15,889
[SPEAKER_19]: Seriously.

808
01:11:19,372 --> 01:11:19,792
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, damn.

809
01:11:21,914 --> 01:11:22,875
[SPEAKER_19]: Looking forward to piss.

810
01:11:22,935 --> 01:11:23,415
[SPEAKER_19]: It'll be fun.

811
01:11:24,696 --> 01:11:27,358
[SPEAKER_19]: But don't call it that in front of him because he'll get really mad.

812
01:11:28,459 --> 01:11:30,301
[SPEAKER_19]: He was a really good sport here at the show the other week.

813
01:11:32,236 --> 01:11:32,817
[SPEAKER_19]: DDR scene this week.

814
01:11:56,559 --> 01:12:03,202
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, they announced their new Dancing Stage game, which I remember had a really dumb name to it.

815
01:12:03,562 --> 01:12:08,844
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not Dancing Stage Fusion, it's like Dancing Stage Happy Fun Time.

816
01:12:08,864 --> 01:12:11,185
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know what the hell it's called, but it's like something.

817
01:12:11,969 --> 01:12:16,311
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyways, and it's got all the crap that was in... It's Dancing Stage Fusion.

818
01:12:16,711 --> 01:12:17,991
[SPEAKER_17]: No, it's not Dancing Stage Fusion.

819
01:12:18,051 --> 01:12:19,152
[SPEAKER_17]: It's called something else.

820
01:12:19,892 --> 01:12:21,313
[SPEAKER_19]: Hold on, I'm going to look at these pictures here.

821
01:12:21,993 --> 01:12:23,754
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, Dancing Stage Dayglo Mix.

822
01:12:23,834 --> 01:12:24,154
[SPEAKER_19]: Was that it?

823
01:12:24,174 --> 01:12:24,854
[SPEAKER_17]: Dayglo Mix.

824
01:12:24,894 --> 01:12:25,654
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what it was.

825
01:12:25,995 --> 01:12:26,615
[SPEAKER_19]: No, no, no.

826
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:28,836
[SPEAKER_19]: That was what somebody said they should call it.

827
01:12:28,916 --> 01:12:30,096
[SPEAKER_19]: That's not what they really call it.

828
01:12:30,296 --> 01:12:35,318
[SPEAKER_19]: Because if you go and you look at the pictures of the cabinet... Let's see.

829
01:12:35,458 --> 01:12:36,459
[SPEAKER_19]: It's Dancing Stage Fusion.

830
01:12:36,779 --> 01:12:39,960
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what somebody on Freak said it should be called because of the way it looked.

831
01:12:40,658 --> 01:12:42,219
[SPEAKER_19]: Dancing Stage Fusion

832
01:13:07,991 --> 01:13:33,128
[SPEAKER_19]: 321 Stars, A, A Stupid Barber, Across the Nightmare, AM3P, Be Lovin', Believe, Can't Stop Falling in Love, Speed Mix, Candy Star, Colors for Extreme, Destiny Lovers, Dive, Dynamite Rave, Soda Mix, Firefly, Familiar Feeling, whatever that is, Healing Vision, Angelic Mix, Heaven and Earth, which I think is a licensed song, It's Rain and Men, you know that one, Kakumei,

833
01:13:33,735 --> 01:13:34,415
[SPEAKER_19]: Keep on moving.

834
01:13:34,735 --> 01:13:39,096
[SPEAKER_19]: Kids in America, Ladies Night, La Senorita and La Senorita Virtual.

835
01:13:39,356 --> 01:13:41,937
[SPEAKER_17]: And Ladies Night, we do want to mention is Atomic Kitten.

[SPEAKER_19]: Make It Better, Make It Better So Real Mix, Mickey, Orion 7-8 Civ Mix, Paranoia Max Dirty Mix, Rapper's Delight.

837
01:13:51,019 --> 01:13:53,599
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, that was in Dancing Stage Fusion.

838
01:13:53,619 --> 01:13:54,799
[SPEAKER_17]: I know, how cool.

839
01:13:55,620 --> 01:14:02,021
[SPEAKER_19]: Still in My Heart, Sync, Tomorrow Perfume, Tough Enough, Trip Machine.

840
01:14:03,024 --> 01:14:30,699
[SPEAKER_17]: try to love you une, deux, trois waiting for tonight you're not here and your reign the rage mix and that's not all of them that's just what was on the demo cabinet that they had that's not everything that's going to be on the mix there's a lot more stuff so it looks pretty good so far but I mean granted it's just exactly like Dancing Stage Fusion or DDR Extreme you know the home versions

841
01:14:32,213 --> 01:14:34,995
[SPEAKER_17]: But hey, it's something new, so, yay!

842
01:14:35,915 --> 01:14:37,356
[SPEAKER_17]: I wonder if they're going to bring anything over here.

843
01:14:37,616 --> 01:14:38,196
[SPEAKER_17]: Probably not.

844
01:14:38,817 --> 01:14:40,958
[SPEAKER_17]: Who knows, you might get lucky, someone might import it.

845
01:14:41,158 --> 01:14:41,858
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't see why not.

846
01:14:41,938 --> 01:14:48,822
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, people import stuff from, you know, Korea and, you know, China and Japan and stuff.

847
01:14:49,222 --> 01:14:50,283
[SPEAKER_17]: Why not from Europe?

848
01:14:50,383 --> 01:14:51,784
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, makes sense to me.

849
01:14:53,445 --> 01:14:54,886
[SPEAKER_17]: But, that's what's going on.

850
01:14:56,186 --> 01:15:00,849
[SPEAKER_17]: And, um, no real, I don't think they really announced when, um...

851
01:15:03,722 --> 01:15:07,465
[SPEAKER_17]: They're going to be releasing that, but we're thinking probably the end of this year.

852
01:15:09,547 --> 01:15:10,848
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, I think it'll be sooner than that.

853
01:15:12,989 --> 01:15:13,289
[SPEAKER_19]: Whatever.

854
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:15,631
[SPEAKER_19]: You know they were showing In The Groove at this show, too.

855
01:15:16,852 --> 01:15:17,493
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, that was right.

856
01:15:18,113 --> 01:15:32,744
[SPEAKER_17]: The In The Groove was being shown by, I forget what company it was, they had boasted that their, what was it, they have, at the show they had gotten 200 orders for In The Groove

857
01:15:33,271 --> 01:15:35,973
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't want to have another In The Groove debate on this show.

858
01:15:35,993 --> 01:15:38,174
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe they'll fix some of the problems with 1 and 2.

859
01:15:57,439 --> 01:16:05,342
[SPEAKER_19]: The longer and longer this goes on, the more and more I'm buying into the theory of Konami, that's what you get for not putting out any more arcade mixes.

860
01:16:05,502 --> 01:16:09,003
[SPEAKER_19]: Honestly, they deserve in the groove to be out there at this point.

861
01:16:09,143 --> 01:16:10,603
[SPEAKER_19]: I just, I don't know.

862
01:16:11,224 --> 01:16:15,185
[SPEAKER_19]: But I still think if they try to release in the groove on a home console, there's going to be issues.

863
01:16:15,685 --> 01:16:16,365
[SPEAKER_19]: I still say that.

864
01:16:17,025 --> 01:16:19,986
[SPEAKER_19]: And you can argue all you want, but I'm welcome to my opinion.

865
01:16:20,987 --> 01:16:22,047
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't wait for them to try.

866
01:16:22,843 --> 01:16:28,568
[SPEAKER_19]: I hope they do try to release on a home console so we can have this debate and get it over with.

867
01:16:30,429 --> 01:16:31,130
[SPEAKER_19]: Seriously.

868
01:16:32,471 --> 01:16:35,873
[SPEAKER_17]: If anything, to watch a show like X-Play rip it apart.

869
01:16:36,894 --> 01:16:37,535
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I don't know.

870
01:16:37,755 --> 01:16:38,615
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know if they would.

871
01:16:39,116 --> 01:16:43,079
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, the casual gamer doesn't give a shit.

872
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:45,060
[SPEAKER_19]: Right?

873
01:16:45,180 --> 01:16:45,481
[SPEAKER_19]: True.

874
01:16:46,221 --> 01:16:52,166
[SPEAKER_17]: That's how pieces of crap like Britney's Dance Beat get out there and get played.

875
01:16:52,845 --> 01:17:01,608
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, people call Pump It Up that dance game and don't realize the differences between that... You know, whatever happened to fucking Pump It Up coming to the Japanese PlayStation 2?

876
01:17:02,429 --> 01:17:04,869
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a game that should be, you know, fucking brought over here.

877
01:17:05,290 --> 01:17:11,392
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it's doing well in, like, all these other countries, but, you know, no one wants to bring it over here, obviously, because of the lawsuits and shit.

878
01:17:11,832 --> 01:17:14,533
[SPEAKER_17]: But yet, stuff like, you know, fucking...

879
01:17:16,075 --> 01:17:21,421
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't understand how one can be okay and the other one can't.

880
01:17:22,122 --> 01:17:22,783
[SPEAKER_17]: You see what I'm saying?

881
01:17:24,505 --> 01:17:24,825
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

882
01:17:27,148 --> 01:17:29,931
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I don't get it, but nothing's going on.

883
01:17:31,741 --> 01:17:36,283
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, I promised that we would open up the Skype line, so that's exactly what I'm going to do.

884
01:17:36,343 --> 01:17:42,686
[SPEAKER_19]: If you want to call into the show, head on over to www.orangelonsradio.com and click on Interact With Us.

885
01:17:43,126 --> 01:17:51,770
[SPEAKER_19]: I do request, Skype actually upgraded to version 1.1 earlier this week, or no, I'm sorry, actually it was earlier this month, it was a little while ago.

886
01:17:52,430 --> 01:17:56,912
[SPEAKER_19]: And they have some new features in it, so make sure you upgrade the latest version.

887
01:17:57,292 --> 01:17:58,313
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

888
01:17:59,969 --> 01:18:00,910
[SPEAKER_19]: Agent Izaku here.

889
01:18:01,150 --> 01:18:02,671
[SPEAKER_19]: Hello, Izaku, how are you?

890
01:18:03,852 --> 01:18:04,173
[SPEAKER_12]: Fine.

891
01:18:04,593 --> 01:18:05,213
[SPEAKER_19]: What's on your mind?

892
01:18:06,194 --> 01:18:10,318
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I'm just looking over, you know, now that DDR Freak went back up again.

893
01:18:10,958 --> 01:18:20,626
[SPEAKER_12]: I was looking over the Dancing States thread, and apparently, to my surprise, during the... For some reason, during the whole event, I looked at, you know, I saw two pictures.

894
01:18:20,846 --> 01:18:25,070
[SPEAKER_12]: One of a person, you know, one of the, you know, Konami's area where they had fusion...

895
01:18:26,811 --> 01:18:38,114
[SPEAKER_12]: It's one of the most recent posts on the thread, I know what you're talking about.

896
01:18:38,974 --> 01:18:41,194
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, and I'm surprised.

897
01:18:41,234 --> 01:18:43,475
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought we were supposed to be behind something like this 100%.

898
01:18:45,275 --> 01:18:45,715
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't get it.

899
01:18:46,415 --> 01:18:54,817
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, from the looks of it, it looks like there was some type of event going on at the Pump It Up booth.

900
01:18:55,865 --> 01:18:57,206
[SPEAKER_19]: And so all those people were there.

901
01:18:57,427 --> 01:19:00,249
[SPEAKER_19]: And whereas Dancing Stage just kind of had the machine out there.

902
01:19:01,010 --> 01:19:01,310
[SPEAKER_12]: Hmm.

903
01:19:02,071 --> 01:19:02,491
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

904
01:19:02,511 --> 01:19:04,753
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess, I don't know if I should accept that as an excuse.

905
01:19:04,813 --> 01:19:10,378
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyways, now that we have, now that DDR itself already hit at least 1.3 billion last year.

906
01:19:10,499 --> 01:19:19,587
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what, Zach, I just want to say, for all you know, I mean, we don't know because we weren't there, but for all we know, there was a topless girl playing Pump It Up at that moment.

907
01:19:20,373 --> 01:19:20,713
[SPEAKER_19]: Really?

908
01:19:22,434 --> 01:19:23,074
[SPEAKER_19]: For all you know.

909
01:19:23,094 --> 01:19:26,956
[SPEAKER_19]: So you don't know why all those people were there, but that's one possible reason.

910
01:19:28,197 --> 01:19:31,218
[SPEAKER_19]: If you look at the picture, they all kind of have that, ooh, boobies look on their face.

911
01:19:31,318 --> 01:19:31,619
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

912
01:19:32,879 --> 01:19:47,687
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyways, now that DDR has already sold 1.2 million last year, totaling up to 2.5 million, which, if I'm not mistaken, should almost count for a quarter of all DDR sales worldwide.

913
01:19:47,707 --> 01:19:47,947
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

914
01:19:48,936 --> 01:19:50,258
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have the latest figures, but sure

915
01:20:07,347 --> 01:20:11,190
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, I don't know, there has to be something done, some sort of action.

916
01:20:11,871 --> 01:20:14,773
[SPEAKER_12]: We already know people, you know, who can make it happen.

917
01:20:14,813 --> 01:20:22,199
[SPEAKER_12]: We just gotta, you know, push, you know, we gotta basically, you know, we just gotta stay on top of this 110%.

918
01:20:22,519 --> 01:20:24,200
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what I'm saying?

919
01:20:24,921 --> 01:20:25,661
[SPEAKER_19]: I hear what you're saying.

920
01:20:25,762 --> 01:20:27,483
[SPEAKER_19]: Honestly, you're preaching to the choir here.

921
01:20:28,143 --> 01:20:29,004
[SPEAKER_19]: You're preaching to the choir here.

922
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:30,125
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not gonna disagree with you.

923
01:20:30,245 --> 01:20:31,806
[SPEAKER_19]: You are absolutely right.

924
01:20:32,046 --> 01:20:34,008
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that we need to be doing a new USA Mix.

925
01:20:34,929 --> 01:20:35,549
[SPEAKER_12]: We have just...

926
01:20:37,097 --> 01:20:45,439
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that the people who have made it happen previously are trying to make it happen again.

927
01:20:45,699 --> 01:20:47,840
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know this for a fact, but I would assume.

928
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:50,961
[SPEAKER_19]: I know that there's people that love DDR trying to make it happen.

929
01:20:51,821 --> 01:20:58,183
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't doubt that they're trying again, but sometimes it's a matter of it's just got to be the right time.

930
01:20:58,243 --> 01:20:59,964
[SPEAKER_19]: You've got to get the people to say the right thing.

931
01:21:00,504 --> 01:21:01,584
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know what it's going to take.

932
01:21:03,061 --> 01:21:14,067
[SPEAKER_19]: But you don't see Silent Scope websites out there with 50,000 dedicated members.

933
01:21:14,747 --> 01:21:18,629
[SPEAKER_19]: To my knowledge, there is no internet radio station dedicated to the game Silent Scope.

934
01:21:19,890 --> 01:21:21,110
[SPEAKER_19]: And there's two for DDR.

935
01:21:21,151 --> 01:21:22,431
[SPEAKER_19]: We can definitely start.

936
01:21:22,471 --> 01:21:23,112
[SPEAKER_19]: We could start one.

937
01:21:23,132 --> 01:21:24,552
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly, but this is a cult following.

938
01:21:24,592 --> 01:21:25,653
[SPEAKER_12]: You have a game here that...

939
01:21:28,447 --> 01:21:30,129
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the thing, you have a cult following.

940
01:21:30,430 --> 01:21:35,416
[SPEAKER_12]: You have people who love this game to the point that it consumes their lives to an extent.

941
01:21:36,517 --> 01:21:42,685
[SPEAKER_12]: And they basically have purpose to make something happen.

942
01:21:43,266 --> 01:21:46,631
[SPEAKER_12]: And in this case, we could go after a new arcade mix.

943
01:21:47,611 --> 01:21:48,912
[SPEAKER_12]: What was that?

944
01:21:49,112 --> 01:21:49,452
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically.

945
01:22:18,153 --> 01:22:23,380
[SPEAKER_12]: I doubt I would see something that perfect, but you know, it's worth a shot.

946
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:27,645
[SPEAKER_19]: I think the most we can do as fans right now, continue to support the games.

947
01:22:27,985 --> 01:22:37,337
[SPEAKER_19]: When the home mixes come out, buy the new home mixes as they come out, support the arcade mixes that are already out there, and just keep showing that there's...

948
01:22:38,295 --> 01:22:39,816
[SPEAKER_19]: Demand out there for dance games.

949
01:22:40,096 --> 01:22:49,460
[SPEAKER_19]: And I hate to say it, but maybe supporting In The Groove, God, I can't believe I just said that, would show folks that there's still a demand out there for dance games.

950
01:22:49,921 --> 01:22:51,962
[SPEAKER_19]: Although, I don't know.

951
01:22:52,042 --> 01:22:54,103
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I still have mixed feelings on In The Groove.

952
01:22:54,583 --> 01:22:54,923
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

953
01:22:56,684 --> 01:22:56,964
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

954
01:22:57,324 --> 01:22:59,165
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I'm going to let you go, buddy, because we've got connection issues.

955
01:22:59,185 --> 01:23:07,389
[SPEAKER_19]: I understand what you're saying, and I hope we can all band together in one happy Bamani Rainbow family.

956
01:23:08,171 --> 01:23:08,792
[SPEAKER_19]: Take care, Zaku.

957
01:23:09,713 --> 01:23:10,173
[SPEAKER_19]: Have a good one.

958
01:23:11,815 --> 01:23:12,655
[SPEAKER_19]: I think he was behind.

959
01:23:13,136 --> 01:23:14,918
[SPEAKER_19]: I think he, like, it was weird.

960
01:23:15,098 --> 01:23:17,220
[SPEAKER_19]: I think he was hearing us about five seconds after we said something.

961
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:18,301
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe that's a weird Skype thing.

962
01:23:18,321 --> 01:23:18,641
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

963
01:23:19,522 --> 01:23:20,803
[SPEAKER_19]: Anything you guys want to add to that?

964
01:23:23,506 --> 01:23:23,646
[SPEAKER_19]: No?

965
01:23:24,607 --> 01:23:24,887
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

966
01:23:26,108 --> 01:23:28,751
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, Skype line's open again if somebody else wants to give us a call.

967
01:23:29,978 --> 01:23:32,019
[SPEAKER_19]: We certainly would love to hear what you have to say.

968
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:35,922
[SPEAKER_19]: Otherwise, I guess we're going to go ahead and get into the Orange Launch Radio cage match next.

969
01:23:35,942 --> 01:23:37,002
[SPEAKER_19]: That would be something exciting.

970
01:23:39,124 --> 01:23:41,105
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm checking out what's going on in the chat room there.

971
01:23:41,125 --> 01:23:49,870
[SPEAKER_19]: Basically, the chat room just kind of saying, didn't so-and-so say that there was going to be a new mix?

972
01:23:50,491 --> 01:23:52,272
[SPEAKER_19]: Didn't so-and-so say this?

973
01:23:53,372 --> 01:23:56,194
[SPEAKER_19]: Honestly, until Konami puts out the press release, it's all hearsay.

974
01:24:00,069 --> 01:24:02,091
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, what's going on?

975
01:24:02,111 --> 01:24:02,451
[SPEAKER_19]: This is Phoenix.

976
01:24:02,471 --> 01:24:02,531
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey.

977
01:24:02,551 --> 01:24:03,432
[SPEAKER_19]: What's on your mind?

978
01:24:30,779 --> 01:24:31,099
[SPEAKER_19]: Hello?

979
01:24:31,339 --> 01:24:31,839
[SPEAKER_19]: What's on your mind?

980
01:24:34,980 --> 01:24:35,540
[SPEAKER_19]: Can you hear me, buddy?

981
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:36,080
[SPEAKER_19]: What's on your mind?

982
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:37,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what's going on?

983
01:24:37,681 --> 01:24:38,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Not much.

984
01:24:38,181 --> 01:24:40,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wanted to say hey to Jamie.

985
01:24:40,801 --> 01:24:41,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope she's feeling better.

986
01:24:41,942 --> 01:24:43,182
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

987
01:24:43,662 --> 01:24:44,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Just chilling out, you know?

988
01:24:44,782 --> 01:24:45,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Listening to the show.

989
01:24:46,363 --> 01:24:49,403
[SPEAKER_19]: Jamie's in the kitchen getting herself a drink so she can feel a little better there.

990
01:24:50,544 --> 01:24:50,704
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

991
01:24:52,124 --> 01:24:52,184
[SPEAKER_19]: Um.

992
01:24:54,128 --> 01:24:54,789
[SPEAKER_19]: Anything on your mind?

993
01:24:54,849 --> 01:24:58,310
[SPEAKER_19]: Any comments, response to things we've been talking about in the show so far?

994
01:24:58,410 --> 01:25:00,470
[SPEAKER_19]: Such as the new Europe DDR mix?

995
01:25:01,531 --> 01:25:03,071
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

996
01:25:03,331 --> 01:25:05,892
[SPEAKER_02]: There just needs to be a new DDR for the US.

997
01:25:06,012 --> 01:25:08,833
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just bogus that they would just drop it like that.

998
01:25:10,239 --> 01:25:11,660
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, there will be a new U.S.

999
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:12,000
[SPEAKER_19]: mix.

1000
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:13,200
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just the home.

1001
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,081
[SPEAKER_19]: It's kind of focused on home right now.

1002
01:25:15,161 --> 01:25:16,002
[SPEAKER_19]: It is kind of weird.

1003
01:25:16,362 --> 01:25:18,883
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, if you think about it, though, the U.S.

1004
01:25:18,983 --> 01:25:21,524
[SPEAKER_19]: arcade mix has stopped a long, long time ago.

1005
01:25:21,564 --> 01:25:22,045
[SPEAKER_19]: They really did.

1006
01:25:22,085 --> 01:25:24,366
[SPEAKER_19]: We only ever had one true U.S.

1007
01:25:24,466 --> 01:25:26,787
[SPEAKER_19]: arcade mix, and it was kind of a mediocre game at best.

1008
01:25:27,627 --> 01:25:29,748
[SPEAKER_19]: But it's the Japanese ones that have really stopped.

1009
01:25:30,609 --> 01:25:33,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was sort of shaky there, but I don't know.

1010
01:25:33,230 --> 01:25:36,631
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they could do, if they really wanted to, they could do what they wanted.

1011
01:25:36,791 --> 01:25:37,952
[SPEAKER_02]: They could come out with a good one.

1012
01:25:38,525 --> 01:25:39,346
[SPEAKER_19]: I know, I know.

1013
01:25:39,466 --> 01:25:48,573
[SPEAKER_19]: And you know what's interesting, though, is that you don't see Konami of Japan putting out this press release going, ooh, DDR Festival sold 1.2 million copies.

1014
01:25:49,033 --> 01:25:50,374
[SPEAKER_19]: You didn't see that press release.

1015
01:25:51,195 --> 01:25:52,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that is true.

1016
01:25:52,216 --> 01:25:53,537
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know.

1017
01:25:54,538 --> 01:25:55,438
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1018
01:25:55,739 --> 01:26:01,663
[SPEAKER_02]: It just seems like a lot of this stuff is going down, like those websites that got shut down the other night.

1019
01:26:02,644 --> 01:26:03,064
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it?

1020
01:26:03,224 --> 01:26:04,305
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR UK and stuff?

1021
01:26:06,107 --> 01:26:06,267
[SPEAKER_02]: What...

1022
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:09,102
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you talking about DDRUK getting shut down?

1023
01:26:09,662 --> 01:26:11,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, those websites getting shut down.

1024
01:26:11,664 --> 01:26:14,186
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, but we know that it has nothing to do with Konami.

1025
01:26:14,226 --> 01:26:19,010
[SPEAKER_19]: That was more of the MP3s in the songpacks, at least assumably.

1026
01:26:19,070 --> 01:26:23,714
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, we're making a lot of assumptions here, but assumably, it was the MP3s that were inside the songpacks.

1027
01:26:24,014 --> 01:26:31,140
[SPEAKER_19]: And remember that, if I'm not mistaken, Loki, correct me if I'm wrong, I wasn't a big DDRUK user, but they didn't just have the official songpacks.

1028
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:33,422
[SPEAKER_19]: They had fan ones too, right?

1029
01:26:33,522 --> 01:26:34,303
[SPEAKER_19]: Am I correct?

1030
01:26:34,323 --> 01:26:35,924
[SPEAKER_19]: Because they did contests and stuff, right?

1031
01:26:36,769 --> 01:26:47,577
[SPEAKER_17]: They didn't have those, but they had links to the Shoei, whatever, his little sim file museum stuff, which I'm sure had a lot of crap in it.

1032
01:26:48,098 --> 01:26:49,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, I don't know.

1033
01:26:50,099 --> 01:26:56,925
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just, I think Step Mania and stuff like that, people are going to get into that more and move that way.

1034
01:26:57,585 --> 01:26:59,727
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, because that's customizable to how you want it.

1035
01:27:00,862 --> 01:27:09,726
[SPEAKER_19]: And I agree, and I think a lot of the cult scene is kind of in there as it is, but until Step Mania is something that's over the counter, I don't think it's a real threat.

1036
01:27:10,827 --> 01:27:11,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that is true, though.

1037
01:27:12,008 --> 01:27:17,330
[SPEAKER_19]: It just kind of keeps the cult thing going, and I think that's why Konami hasn't stepped in and done anything about it.

1038
01:27:17,610 --> 01:27:21,272
[SPEAKER_19]: But I think if Step Mania were to be something that was sold over the counter, well, then there'd be an issue.

1039
01:27:21,332 --> 01:27:23,453
[SPEAKER_19]: But then again, what is in the groove?

1040
01:27:23,573 --> 01:27:25,594
[SPEAKER_19]: In the groove is Step Mania, basically.

1041
01:27:25,614 --> 01:27:25,694
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

1042
01:27:26,740 --> 01:27:47,093
[SPEAKER_19]: so I don't know but until and that's why I say that I don't think Konami is going to do anything about In The Groove unless they try to invade on the home market but of course In The Groove says they have the patents okay whatever fine I'm not going to dispute that but I do think if they try to go to the home route there's going to be a bit of clashing heads there

1043
01:27:47,506 --> 01:27:49,047
[SPEAKER_19]: Because that's Konami's baby right now.

1044
01:27:49,327 --> 01:27:51,169
[SPEAKER_19]: It's obvious they're putting out press releases on it.

1045
01:27:51,209 --> 01:27:52,069
[SPEAKER_19]: You know it's their baby.

1046
01:27:52,990 --> 01:27:56,732
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they have to be planning to do something to put out a press release.

1047
01:27:56,772 --> 01:28:01,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that would just be silly to be like, we sold a million copies and then drop it.

1048
01:28:02,196 --> 01:28:05,318
[SPEAKER_19]: I was just a little disappointed that they didn't announce anything the same day.

1049
01:28:05,659 --> 01:28:08,601
[SPEAKER_19]: We all know that DDR Mario is in the making in Japan.

1050
01:28:08,921 --> 01:28:12,303
[SPEAKER_19]: So, why not tell us US folks we're going to get it?

1051
01:28:12,323 --> 01:28:13,284
[SPEAKER_19]: Because we better be getting it.

1052
01:28:13,826 --> 01:28:15,690
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not liking the DDR Mario.

1053
01:28:15,710 --> 01:28:17,112
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's going to be a little bogus.

1054
01:28:17,573 --> 01:28:20,138
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Mario's a little played out.

1055
01:28:20,598 --> 01:28:22,201
[SPEAKER_02]: That was sort of in the 90s.

1056
01:28:23,003 --> 01:28:25,768
[SPEAKER_19]: Regardless, love or hate Mario, it's more DDR.

1057
01:28:26,570 --> 01:28:27,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that is true.

1058
01:28:27,490 --> 01:28:29,111
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.

1059
01:28:29,651 --> 01:28:31,031
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, any other comments you got for us?

1060
01:28:31,871 --> 01:28:33,491
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's pretty much about it.

1061
01:28:33,912 --> 01:28:34,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wanted to call in.

1062
01:28:34,752 --> 01:28:35,492
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my first time.

1063
01:28:36,212 --> 01:28:37,792
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, thank you for calling in.

1064
01:28:37,832 --> 01:28:38,873
[SPEAKER_19]: It's your virgin phone call.

1065
01:28:38,913 --> 01:28:39,533
[SPEAKER_19]: We appreciate it.

1066
01:28:39,693 --> 01:28:41,753
[SPEAKER_19]: We're glad to initiate you into Orange Lounge.

1067
01:28:42,113 --> 01:28:43,193
[SPEAKER_11]: Ha ha ha ha.

1068
01:28:43,374 --> 01:28:47,034
[SPEAKER_19]: And Jamie, you may have missed it because you were in the kitchen, but he did say he hopes you feel better.

1069
01:28:47,254 --> 01:28:47,774
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1070
01:28:47,874 --> 01:28:48,415
[SPEAKER_11]: I do too.

1071
01:28:49,735 --> 01:28:51,235
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, we don't want Jamie to die on air.

1072
01:28:51,495 --> 01:28:52,215
[SPEAKER_19]: That would not be cool.

1073
01:28:52,715 --> 01:28:53,436
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that'd be sad.

1074
01:28:53,536 --> 01:28:55,076
[SPEAKER_11]: It'd be interesting for ratings.

1075
01:28:55,096 --> 01:28:55,216
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

1076
01:28:56,657 --> 01:28:56,957
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1077
01:28:57,257 --> 01:28:57,957
[SPEAKER_19]: Have a good one, Phoenix.

1078
01:28:57,977 --> 01:28:58,718
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for calling in, bud.

1079
01:28:58,738 --> 01:28:59,218
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, man.

1080
01:28:59,458 --> 01:28:59,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Later.

1081
01:29:01,398 --> 01:29:01,978
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1082
01:29:02,879 --> 01:29:03,599
[SPEAKER_19]: New callers.

1083
01:29:03,659 --> 01:29:05,299
[SPEAKER_19]: We like hearing from new people once in a while.

1084
01:29:05,799 --> 01:29:06,239
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, my God.

1085
01:29:06,519 --> 01:29:08,260
[SPEAKER_19]: Jamie's head exploded in the bathroom.

1086
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:08,820
[SPEAKER_19]: What was that?

1087
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,181
[SPEAKER_19]: I just heard this giant achoo.

1088
01:29:12,921 --> 01:29:13,201
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1089
01:29:13,681 --> 01:29:16,682
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, we're going to get into the Orange Lounge Radio cage match.

[SPEAKER_19]: So it's last week's winner.

1093

[SPEAKER_19]: It's been winning two weeks in a row now.

1094
01:30:12,113 --> 01:30:15,836
[SPEAKER_19]: So if it wins tonight, that'll be week number three, halfway to retirement.

1095

[SPEAKER_19]: Let's see if we can do it.

1096
01:30:17,097 --> 01:30:17,678

[SPEAKER_19]: Song number one, Echo Image, Endless Day.

01:30:21,241 --> 01:30:23,062
We made back in time so we can try

1099
01:30:55,259 --> 01:30:55,923
Thanks for watching!

1100
01:32:07,025 --> 01:32:08,089
Thanks for watching!

1101
01:32:51,193 --> 01:32:51,873
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, though.

1102
01:32:51,933 --> 01:32:55,475
[SPEAKER_19]: Song number one in tonight's cage match, Echo Image, Endless Day.

1103
01:32:55,535 --> 01:32:56,495
[SPEAKER_19]: A clip of that there.

1104
01:32:57,856 --> 01:33:01,517
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, let's see if it does it again tonight, but we've got to get the challengers in.

1105
01:33:01,637 --> 01:33:03,818
[SPEAKER_19]: First up is DarkSakura's pick.

1106
01:33:03,858 --> 01:33:04,798
[SPEAKER_19]: What did you pick for us tonight?

1107
01:33:05,639 --> 01:33:08,140
[SPEAKER_11]: Some Eurobeat song.

1108
01:33:08,620 --> 01:33:10,901
[SPEAKER_19]: It's been a while since we've had some Eurobeat in the cage match.

1109
01:33:11,121 --> 01:33:16,483
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Dream, their version of Night of Fire, but it's a different mix of the sort of rock mix.

1110
01:33:16,563 --> 01:33:17,623
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember the name of it.

1111
01:33:17,903 --> 01:33:19,704
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, Dream originally did Night of Fire.

1112
01:33:20,264 --> 01:33:20,364
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

1113
01:33:20,444 --> 01:33:21,084
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I thought they did.

1114
01:33:21,144 --> 01:33:21,504
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry.

1115
01:33:21,824 --> 01:33:24,045
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that was the guy who did Night of Fire.

1116
01:33:24,305 --> 01:33:24,705
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, my bad.

1117
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:25,966
[SPEAKER_11]: And then Dream, I think, redid it.

1118
01:33:26,661 --> 01:33:27,982
[SPEAKER_19]: Night of Fire, Dream of Dream Mix

1119
01:34:03,158 --> 01:34:05,720
Night Dog Fire Night Dog Fire Night Dog Fire

1120
01:34:42,299 --> 01:34:43,420
Thank you for watching!

1121
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:13,341
Thank you for watching!

1122
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:44,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't say those sweet, kind words.

1123
01:35:44,921 --> 01:35:47,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it'll make me feel like I'm going to cry.

1124
01:35:47,981 --> 01:35:49,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Even at times like this, stay by my side.

1125
01:35:49,862 --> 01:35:51,662
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll give you strength, I'll protect you.

1126
01:35:51,702 --> 01:35:55,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you'll always be there for me.

1127
01:35:55,163 --> 01:35:58,444
Because I want to sing with you and be with you.

1128
01:36:14,108 --> 01:36:16,690
Night of Fire 今あなたと運命を感じてみたいよ Night of Fire 言えないけど抱きしめて欲しい日もあるよ Night of Fire 惹かれていくあなたに

1129
01:36:44,662 --> 01:36:47,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Night of Fire Night of Fire Night of Fire Night of Fire

1130
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:26,024
Night of Fire Night of Fire

1131
01:37:46,187 --> 01:37:51,071
[SPEAKER_19]: Alrighty, that was song number two, Dream with Night of Fire, the Dream of Dream Mix.

1132
01:37:51,412 --> 01:37:54,194
[SPEAKER_19]: Did we here in the studio find that song to be dreamy?

1133
01:37:55,215 --> 01:37:55,535
[SPEAKER_19]: Or not?

1134
01:37:56,055 --> 01:37:56,376
[SPEAKER_19]: Jamie?

1135
01:37:56,776 --> 01:37:57,316
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't care.

1136
01:38:00,839 --> 01:38:02,140
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess that's her final word on the matter.

1137
01:38:02,701 --> 01:38:03,161
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, Loki?

1138
01:38:05,783 --> 01:38:05,944
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1139
01:38:06,544 --> 01:38:08,125
[SPEAKER_17]: No, no, no, no, no.

1140
01:38:09,126 --> 01:38:10,067
[SPEAKER_17]: I was too listening to it.

1141
01:38:10,087 --> 01:38:10,888
[SPEAKER_17]: It's Night of Fire.

1142
01:38:10,968 --> 01:38:12,069
[SPEAKER_17]: What else do I need to know?

1143
01:38:12,549 --> 01:38:13,770
[SPEAKER_11]: You weren't fucking listening to it.

1144
01:38:13,970 --> 01:38:14,911
[SPEAKER_11]: You had your headphones on.

1145
01:38:15,316 --> 01:38:18,199
[SPEAKER_11]: On one side of my head, just like DJs do.

1146
01:38:19,980 --> 01:38:22,482
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I'm sorry, I did listen to it, and you know what?

1147
01:38:22,903 --> 01:38:24,824
[SPEAKER_17]: It's still Night of Fire, so it gets like a 7.

1148
01:38:26,906 --> 01:38:27,647
[SPEAKER_17]: That's about it, though.

1149
01:38:27,927 --> 01:38:29,208
[SPEAKER_17]: No more, because it is Eurobeat.

1150
01:38:29,668 --> 01:38:31,650
[SPEAKER_17]: The Eurobeat part of it, you know, really... I...

1151
01:38:38,192 --> 01:38:41,433
[SPEAKER_19]: I had a lot of fear going into that, but it actually was pretty neat.

1152
01:38:41,993 --> 01:38:44,534
[SPEAKER_19]: I actually thought it would be more Eurobeat than it ended up being.

1153
01:38:45,474 --> 01:38:46,134
[SPEAKER_19]: It wasn't too bad.

1154
01:38:46,174 --> 01:38:46,954
[SPEAKER_19]: It was kind of catchy.

1155
01:38:47,174 --> 01:38:47,734
[SPEAKER_19]: I give it like an 8.

1156
01:38:48,715 --> 01:38:49,015
[SPEAKER_19]: Angel.

1157
01:38:50,575 --> 01:38:51,055
[SPEAKER_10]: I like it.

1158
01:38:51,155 --> 01:38:51,755
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Eurobeat.

1159
01:38:51,895 --> 01:38:53,596
[SPEAKER_10]: Eurobeat is fun.

1160
01:38:53,936 --> 01:38:53,596
8.5.

1161
01:38:55,796 --> 01:38:56,236
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

1162
01:38:56,256 --> 01:38:56,937
[SPEAKER_10]: It goes enough.

1163
01:38:59,257 --> 01:39:01,678
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, let's get into Loki's pick.

1164
01:39:01,798 --> 01:39:02,838
[SPEAKER_19]: Loki, what did you pick tonight?

1165
01:39:05,537 --> 01:39:11,378
[SPEAKER_17]: My song is from a group called Osiris, and it's Oneness with the Universe, is what it's called.

1166
01:39:11,398 --> 01:39:13,819
[SPEAKER_17]: It's an awesome trans compilation I got a while back.

1167
01:39:16,359 --> 01:39:16,680
[SPEAKER_17]: It's good.

1168
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:17,200
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

1169
01:39:19,860 --> 01:39:23,601
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, let's... It's only because you don't want to fucking hear girls again.

1170
01:39:23,761 --> 01:39:27,022
[SPEAKER_17]: And goddammit, if this doesn't go in, you can expect girls next week.

1171
01:39:27,222 --> 01:39:27,502
[SPEAKER_17]: Got it?

1172
01:39:30,268 --> 01:39:30,909
[SPEAKER_19]: We will see.

1173
01:39:31,109 --> 01:39:33,732
[SPEAKER_19]: Osiris, Oneness with the Universe.

1174
01:39:33,992 --> 01:39:34,893
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's check it out.

1175
01:39:35,093 --> 01:39:35,754
[SPEAKER_19]: Song number three.

1176
01:40:00,033 --> 01:40:01,555
DarkSakura.com

1177
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:41,069
Thanks for watching!

1178
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:12,644
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's see what folks thought of Osiris, Oneness with the Universe.

1179
01:44:12,784 --> 01:44:16,347
[SPEAKER_19]: Were we oneness with that song, or were we better off without that song?

1180
01:44:16,387 --> 01:44:16,667
[SPEAKER_19]: Jamie?

1181
01:44:20,010 --> 01:44:24,614
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm drugged, and it was enhancing my drugged state of mind, so it gets a seven.

1182
01:44:25,455 --> 01:44:25,795
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1183
01:44:26,275 --> 01:44:26,616
[SPEAKER_17]: Loki?

1184
01:44:26,656 --> 01:44:26,916
[SPEAKER_17]: Loki.

1185
01:44:29,252 --> 01:44:29,492
[SPEAKER_17]: Angel Angel

1186
01:44:57,938 --> 01:45:07,920
[SPEAKER_10]: It was okay, but you know how those type of songs are, they get kind of repetitive, so I was semi-zoning out at the end of it, so I'll be nice and give it a six.

1187
01:45:10,401 --> 01:45:10,861
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow.

1188
01:45:12,061 --> 01:45:13,922
[SPEAKER_19]: Angel usually doesn't give anything below a nine.

1189
01:45:13,962 --> 01:45:14,622
[SPEAKER_19]: That's pretty harsh.

1190
01:45:14,682 --> 01:45:15,002
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1191
01:45:15,902 --> 01:45:19,263
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight.

1192
01:45:19,303 --> 01:45:24,444
[SPEAKER_19]: Song number one, Endless Day with, I'm sorry, Echo Image with Endless Day.

1193
01:45:33,283 --> 01:45:38,064
[SPEAKER_19]: Song number two, Dream with Night of Fire, the Dream of Dream mix.

1194
01:45:39,005 --> 01:45:42,886
[SPEAKER_07]: And song number three, Osiris, Oneness with the Universe.

1195
01:46:00,189 --> 01:46:06,592
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, place boat now and send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

1196
01:46:06,752 --> 01:46:07,333
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, he's right.

1197
01:46:07,353 --> 01:46:09,474
[SPEAKER_19]: When you listen to a little clip of that song, it sounds pretty cool.

1198
01:46:10,094 --> 01:46:10,414
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

1199
01:46:12,595 --> 01:46:16,257
[SPEAKER_19]: If I were to just play the clips, I probably would have given that song like a 9.

1200
01:46:17,138 --> 01:46:17,458
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

1201
01:46:20,479 --> 01:46:22,100
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe we'll do that for the cage match one night.

1202
01:46:22,140 --> 01:46:23,181
[SPEAKER_19]: It'll just be a clip match.

1203
01:46:24,247 --> 01:46:25,747
[SPEAKER_19]: Then we could put like 30 songs in.

1204
01:46:25,767 --> 01:46:26,348
[SPEAKER_19]: It would be awesome.

1205
01:46:26,808 --> 01:46:27,388
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, we'll see.

1206
01:46:29,308 --> 01:46:30,809
[SPEAKER_19]: Remember, private message.

1207
01:46:32,549 --> 01:46:34,790
[SPEAKER_19]: Some folks are yelling out their votes in the chat room.

1208
01:46:34,890 --> 01:46:35,830
[SPEAKER_19]: Doesn't work that way.

1209
01:46:36,010 --> 01:46:36,831
[SPEAKER_19]: Send a private message.

1210
01:46:36,851 --> 01:46:38,171
[SPEAKER_19]: If you don't know how to do that, ask.

1211
01:46:39,071 --> 01:46:40,191
[SPEAKER_19]: That's all you got to do is ask.

1212
01:46:41,572 --> 01:46:42,152
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, Bugged.

1213
01:46:42,372 --> 01:46:45,813
[SPEAKER_19]: I noticed Bugged walked into the room while we were doing the cage match there.

1214
01:46:47,233 --> 01:46:49,854
[SPEAKER_19]: Another local Techmaster type person.

1215
01:46:49,914 --> 01:46:52,895
[SPEAKER_19]: Not the Techmasa of Orange Lounge Radio, but a Techmasa.

1216
01:46:55,871 --> 01:46:56,991
[SPEAKER_19]: Wait, get a mic.

1217
01:46:57,031 --> 01:46:57,512
[SPEAKER_19]: We can't hear you.

1218
01:46:58,732 --> 01:46:59,432
[SPEAKER_19]: He says get a mic.

1219
01:47:02,974 --> 01:47:03,114
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1220
01:47:04,274 --> 01:47:05,995
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the best shirt ever.

1221
01:47:07,255 --> 01:47:09,376
[SPEAKER_19]: Bugs is wearing a shirt that says we'll work for bandwidth.

1222
01:47:10,296 --> 01:47:10,897
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's true.

1223
01:47:12,917 --> 01:47:13,278
[SPEAKER_21]: I have.

1224
01:47:14,878 --> 01:47:18,039
[SPEAKER_19]: Unfortunately, you are not the tech master of Orange Lounge Radio.

1225
01:47:18,059 --> 01:47:18,599
[SPEAKER_19]: Who do I have to kill?

1226
01:47:19,380 --> 01:47:19,500
[SPEAKER_19]: Loki.

1227
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:19,800
[SPEAKER_19]: Loki.

1228
01:47:20,467 --> 01:47:26,272
[SPEAKER_19]: and then probably you'd have to kill VXJ's next V too because really he's a big tech guy for the station too.

1229
01:47:26,312 --> 01:47:29,994
[SPEAKER_19]: He's more of the web god slash internet penis.

1230
01:47:31,676 --> 01:47:32,937
[SPEAKER_19]: Then Loki's the tech massa.

1231
01:47:32,997 --> 01:47:35,559
[SPEAKER_19]: You're just A tech massa.

1232
01:47:35,959 --> 01:47:38,721
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, I can live with A. You're from another department.

1233
01:47:41,163 --> 01:47:42,804
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll take tech master overlord.

1234
01:47:45,546 --> 01:47:46,447
[SPEAKER_19]: That might work, we'll see.

1235
01:47:48,354 --> 01:47:50,795
[SPEAKER_19]: You were a tech master before being a tech master was cool.

1236
01:47:51,155 --> 01:47:51,875
[SPEAKER_21]: This is very true.

1237
01:47:53,956 --> 01:47:57,237
[SPEAKER_19]: Bugged and I went to not only high school together, but junior high school together.

1238
01:47:57,637 --> 01:47:58,297
[SPEAKER_19]: Long time ago.

1239
01:47:58,317 --> 01:48:00,098
[SPEAKER_19]: I know Bugged a long fucking time.

1240
01:48:00,718 --> 01:48:01,578
[SPEAKER_21]: I know Rob's real name.

1241
01:48:01,638 --> 01:48:04,980
[SPEAKER_21]: It's Robert.

1242
01:48:05,020 --> 01:48:05,840
[SPEAKER_19]: No, that's my last name.

1243
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:06,620
[SPEAKER_19]: Remember Roberts?

1244
01:48:07,220 --> 01:48:07,500
[SPEAKER_19]: Get it?

1245
01:48:08,381 --> 01:48:08,861
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, anyway.

1246
01:48:09,821 --> 01:48:10,301
[SPEAKER_19]: Moving on.

1247
01:48:10,861 --> 01:48:15,343
[SPEAKER_19]: Speaking of the VXJSONXV, our buddy and pal,

1248
01:48:16,127 --> 01:48:43,302
[SPEAKER_19]: He actually sent me a link, he wanted me to talk about this on the show tonight at some point I know Loki brought this up briefly, I think a couple shows ago It's this, you know how we were talking about In the Groove and how this is what Konami gets for not putting out a new arcade mix lately Well now, In the Groove is going to have some competition It's a game called Dance Tracks And it's another new game being put out by some folks Loki, have you heard about this one at all?

1249
01:48:45,106 --> 01:48:45,727
[SPEAKER_17]: DTX.PulseNetwork.net

1250
01:48:57,700 --> 01:49:02,061
[SPEAKER_19]: I will be so kind as to post a link in the chatroom there, if you want.

1251
01:49:02,581 --> 01:49:12,803
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, there really isn't a whole lot there besides a lot of blue, but they do have some screenshots from the game, except the screenshots they have are not from the in-game mode.

1252
01:49:12,883 --> 01:49:14,944
[SPEAKER_19]: It is the select play mode screen.

1253
01:49:15,324 --> 01:49:16,444
[SPEAKER_19]: Woo!

1254
01:49:16,544 --> 01:49:17,785
[SPEAKER_21]: It's so brilliant.

1255
01:49:17,985 --> 01:49:19,065
[SPEAKER_19]: Woo, I'm so excited.

1256
01:49:20,525 --> 01:49:24,106
[SPEAKER_19]: But what they do post in here is they post a partial song list.

1257
01:49:24,554 --> 01:49:30,079
[SPEAKER_19]: So you look at the track list here, and I noticed that LMK is on the track list.

1258
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:31,501
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, hmm, that's interesting.

1259
01:49:32,181 --> 01:49:34,504
[SPEAKER_19]: And let's see, I noticed this, this I thought was interesting.

1260
01:49:34,684 --> 01:49:44,953
[SPEAKER_19]: Ace of Base with Cruel Summer, Bad Religion with Inner Logic, Mindless Self-Indulgence has a couple tracks on there.

1261
01:49:45,514 --> 01:49:46,295
[SPEAKER_19]: Jenny Rom!

1262
01:49:46,935 --> 01:49:48,597
[SPEAKER_21]: What precisely are you to do to these songs?

1263
01:49:48,837 --> 01:49:50,239
[SPEAKER_17]: DM Ashura with Neon Rush DM Ashura with Neon Rush

1264
01:50:06,403 --> 01:50:07,484
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, so it looks pretty good.

1265
01:50:07,524 --> 01:50:09,545
[SPEAKER_17]: At least they've got some good musicians behind it.

1266
01:50:09,925 --> 01:50:24,234
[SPEAKER_17]: And if I remember correctly, I do remember hearing this way the hell back in the day, because they were actually going in the Bamai Style music production thread, and they were asking people to help them out with game music and stuff.

1267
01:50:24,374 --> 01:50:26,295
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I know these people signed on there.

1268
01:50:27,115 --> 01:50:28,836
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's where I remember this from, at least.

1269
01:50:28,916 --> 01:50:32,278
[SPEAKER_17]: But hey, at least they've got better people making music.

1270
01:50:33,059 --> 01:50:33,259
[SPEAKER_17]: So...

1271
01:50:34,145 --> 01:50:37,527
[SPEAKER_17]: I see what they have to show first.

1272
01:50:37,567 --> 01:50:41,469
[SPEAKER_17]: Can't really go by much of this menu graphics crap.

1273
01:50:41,669 --> 01:50:45,291
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

1274
01:50:48,092 --> 01:50:48,692
[SPEAKER_17]: Watch it.

1275
01:50:48,772 --> 01:50:49,312
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I don't know.

1276
01:50:50,393 --> 01:50:56,436
[SPEAKER_17]: DJ Slash, he was also the guy that did a lot of stuff back in the day on the DWI Palace.

1277
01:50:57,757 --> 01:51:02,639
[SPEAKER_17]: You've got, of course, I can't see the guy's name under his

1278
01:51:03,633 --> 01:51:31,464
[SPEAKER_17]: um that was also another sim file maker I know um yeah looks like just a lot of people from the DWI community and stepmania stuff hmm it's kinda neat we'll see we'll see there's really nothing here for me yet we'll see I'll keep my eye on this and we'll see that's about all I can say

1279
01:51:32,762 --> 01:51:33,722
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't fuck it up, guys!

1280
01:51:36,483 --> 01:51:38,144
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, uh, let's see.

1281
01:51:39,764 --> 01:51:40,284
[SPEAKER_19]: Do they really?

1282
01:51:40,384 --> 01:51:41,205
[SPEAKER_19]: I totally missed that.

1283
01:51:43,185 --> 01:51:44,806
[SPEAKER_19]: El Mullet says Queen of Love is on there.

1284
01:51:44,886 --> 01:51:45,826
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh my god, they're right.

1285
01:51:45,886 --> 01:51:47,586
[SPEAKER_19]: Wild Side with Queen of Love is on there.

1286
01:51:48,007 --> 01:51:48,607
[SPEAKER_19]: That's awesome.

1287
01:51:48,827 --> 01:51:54,188
[SPEAKER_19]: That's like an English version of Bacquois, although it's not really, because it's not actually the lyrics in English, it's just the melody.

1288
01:51:54,889 --> 01:51:55,569
[SPEAKER_19]: But that's kind of neat.

1289
01:51:56,649 --> 01:51:58,790
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, so I have a pretty decent track list so far.

1290
01:51:58,870 --> 01:51:59,550
[SPEAKER_19]: It's very, uh,

1291
01:51:59,983 --> 01:52:04,928
[SPEAKER_19]: DDR Chibi-ish with a little bit of American flavor in there.

1292
01:52:05,629 --> 01:52:06,109
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll see.

1293
01:52:08,532 --> 01:52:08,932
[SPEAKER_19]: Interesting.

1294
01:52:09,733 --> 01:52:10,654
[SPEAKER_19]: More as it develops.

1295
01:52:11,222 --> 01:52:12,442
[SPEAKER_19]: Skype line's open again.

1296
01:52:12,662 --> 01:52:21,525
[SPEAKER_19]: If you would like to send us a call, you can just head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on interact with us and you can call us on the Skype line.

1297
01:52:21,925 --> 01:52:28,087
[SPEAKER_19]: I noticed not a lot of people on the Skype line tonight so I'm thinking we might not get a whole lot of calls but it is open if you do want to give us a call.

1298
01:52:28,787 --> 01:52:30,907
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, please make sure you have the latest version.

1299
01:52:30,927 --> 01:52:35,309
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to be tallying up those votes for Cage Match pretty soon.

1300
01:52:35,949 --> 01:52:37,029
[SPEAKER_19]: What else is in the news this week?

1301
01:52:37,069 --> 01:52:40,110
[SPEAKER_19]: I had another article I wanted to talk about and then I got sidetracked with this

1302
01:52:41,107 --> 01:52:42,308
[SPEAKER_19]: and DTXThing.

1303
01:52:46,110 --> 01:52:48,111
[SPEAKER_19]: Loki, how about what's going on in the sim scene?

1304
01:52:48,151 --> 01:52:48,572
[SPEAKER_17]: Why not?

1305
01:52:48,592 --> 01:52:49,692
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll get your sim update done.

1306
01:52:50,693 --> 01:52:53,855
[SPEAKER_17]: What's not going on in the sim scene is more like it.

1307
01:52:54,575 --> 01:52:57,157
[SPEAKER_17]: Still, DDRUK is still down.

1308
01:52:57,257 --> 01:52:58,398
[SPEAKER_17]: Same with DDR Maniacs.

1309
01:52:59,038 --> 01:53:00,799
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not looking good for DDR Maniacs.

1310
01:53:00,839 --> 01:53:04,481
[SPEAKER_17]: They've been down for months, so say goodbye to them, probably.

1311
01:53:05,362 --> 01:53:07,363
[SPEAKER_17]: DDRUK is still down for a while.

1312
01:53:07,523 --> 01:53:10,045
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to bet that they're not coming back either.

1313
01:53:10,943 --> 01:53:16,668
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, and then you've got BamaiStyle, um, nothing really too much going on there.

1314
01:53:17,428 --> 01:53:27,696
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, pretty much the only other thing, like I mentioned last week, there's, um, a bunch of different, like, food mix type stuff that's coming out, actually.

1315
01:53:28,757 --> 01:53:36,403
[SPEAKER_17]: A bunch of different ones that I was testing out, um, a while back, like last week or so, that are, um, in the works.

1316
01:53:36,423 --> 01:53:37,864
[SPEAKER_17]: Excuse me.

1317
01:53:40,286 --> 01:53:40,386
[SPEAKER_17]: Um,

1318
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:44,241
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me see here.

1319
01:53:45,301 --> 01:53:51,883
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, we've got... Let me pull this up real quick here.

1320
01:53:53,723 --> 01:53:54,764
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, we are getting a call.

1321
01:53:55,184 --> 01:53:56,044
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, take that call.

1322
01:53:57,364 --> 01:53:58,605
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

1323
01:54:01,105 --> 01:54:01,545
[SPEAKER_19]: Hello?

1324
01:54:02,906 --> 01:54:04,266
[SPEAKER_19]: Hello, you are on Orange Sounds Radio.

1325
01:54:07,047 --> 01:54:07,467
[SPEAKER_19]: Can you hear us?

1326
01:54:07,607 --> 01:54:08,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, there we go.

1327
01:54:08,427 --> 01:54:08,987
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

1328
01:54:09,167 --> 01:54:10,508
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

1329
01:54:10,708 --> 01:54:11,108
[SPEAKER_19]: Who is this?

1330
01:54:11,735 --> 01:54:12,495
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Raichan.

1331
01:54:12,635 --> 01:54:13,916
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi Raichan, how are you?

1332
01:54:14,436 --> 01:54:16,177
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been a while since I've called you guys.

1333
01:54:16,257 --> 01:54:18,278
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought I'd just call and say hi.

1334
01:54:18,298 --> 01:54:19,739
[SPEAKER_19]: It has been a little while.

1335
01:54:19,839 --> 01:54:20,879
[SPEAKER_19]: Hello to you, my friend.

1336
01:54:23,140 --> 01:54:27,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Joyce is sitting over here working on my Katamari hat again.

1337
01:54:28,122 --> 01:54:29,463
[SPEAKER_09]: She's doing the last little bit.

1338
01:54:29,783 --> 01:54:31,204
[SPEAKER_19]: Hello, Joyce, as well.

1339
01:54:31,464 --> 01:54:32,104
[SPEAKER_19]: Hope you're doing well.

1340
01:54:32,777 --> 01:54:35,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, he says hello, Joyce, saying he hopes you're doing well.

1341
01:54:35,639 --> 01:54:36,099
[SPEAKER_09]: She waves.

1342
01:54:37,079 --> 01:54:37,519
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1343
01:54:38,220 --> 01:54:39,400
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got the headphones on.

1344
01:54:39,961 --> 01:54:41,742
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, you guys are making hats together?

1345
01:54:42,522 --> 01:54:47,084
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, well, she hasn't taught me how to crochet yet, which is the next project.

1346
01:54:47,645 --> 01:54:49,065
[SPEAKER_09]: She's teaching me how to do it.

1347
01:54:49,165 --> 01:54:53,367
[SPEAKER_09]: She's working on a Katamari hat for me, and then she's going to do one for Jason, too.

1348
01:54:54,108 --> 01:54:55,929
[SPEAKER_19]: What exactly is a Katamari hat?

1349
01:54:57,109 --> 01:55:00,651
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a girl that sold a hat on eBay recently for $130 that

1350
01:55:02,887 --> 01:55:05,569
[SPEAKER_09]: was a crocheted hat that was like a Katamari ball.

1351
01:55:06,370 --> 01:55:10,333
[SPEAKER_09]: It had the little bumps on it like the Katamari have.

1352
01:55:11,594 --> 01:55:12,415
[SPEAKER_19]: And the little hearts.

1353
01:55:12,575 --> 01:55:15,137
[SPEAKER_19]: I noticed on the little hat it had little hearts in the bumps.

1354
01:55:15,457 --> 01:55:16,038
[SPEAKER_19]: So cute.

1355
01:55:16,538 --> 01:55:17,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Virgo one.

1356
01:55:17,299 --> 01:55:22,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Mine's the one with all the hearts and the pink and all that sort of stuff.

1357
01:55:22,824 --> 01:55:28,128
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have a really good one in my journal, but I did post one in Damacy Loving.

1358
01:55:29,372 --> 01:55:34,014
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you want to see a picture of this, go to LiveJournal and look up Dimash 11, and there's a picture of it.

1359
01:55:34,735 --> 01:55:39,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Here, let me see if I can find that one real quick, and I'll post a link in the chat room.

1360
01:55:39,697 --> 01:55:40,058
[SPEAKER_19]: Awesome.

1361
01:55:40,778 --> 01:55:44,240
[SPEAKER_19]: Chat room again over at www.orangenautoradio.com, click on chat.

1362
01:55:44,780 --> 01:55:50,163
[SPEAKER_19]: So you're going to be learning how to crochet, and you'll be doing a hat as well for yourself?

1363
01:55:50,983 --> 01:55:52,424
[SPEAKER_19]: No, the one being made now is for you.

1364
01:55:53,184 --> 01:55:54,465
[SPEAKER_09]: The one being made now is for me.

1365
01:55:54,545 --> 01:55:56,086
[SPEAKER_19]: And then you're going to make one for Jason.

1366
01:55:56,949 --> 01:55:58,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, she's actually got one started for Jason.

1367
01:55:58,870 --> 01:55:59,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

1368
01:55:59,350 --> 01:56:01,691
[SPEAKER_19]: But you're going to learn how to crochet because it's fun.

1369
01:56:03,172 --> 01:56:03,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1370
01:56:03,952 --> 01:56:04,692
[SPEAKER_19]: Right on, right on.

1371
01:56:05,733 --> 01:56:07,453
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, how about that DDR?

1372
01:56:07,493 --> 01:56:08,714
[SPEAKER_19]: Any DDR news you want to share?

1373
01:56:10,294 --> 01:56:13,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I started talking to Middyhead last night.

1374
01:56:13,276 --> 01:56:13,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah?

1375
01:56:14,316 --> 01:56:24,220
[SPEAKER_09]: He was saying something because I started a step file for House of Joy and recently just got things set up for Maxim.

1376
01:56:25,077 --> 01:56:29,059
[SPEAKER_09]: and I posted in his forum about it and he sounds really interested.

1377
01:56:29,140 --> 01:56:33,882
[SPEAKER_09]: He might actually do some remixes specifically for Step Mania.

1378
01:56:34,263 --> 01:56:35,683
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow, that's kind of neat.

1379
01:56:36,084 --> 01:56:36,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1380
01:56:36,364 --> 01:56:37,224
[SPEAKER_09]: That guy is so cool.

1381
01:56:37,264 --> 01:56:38,185
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm excited about that.

1382
01:56:38,717 --> 01:56:41,999
[SPEAKER_19]: I was talking to him about maybe we can just take and put him up in the VIP area for his site, but

1383
01:57:08,550 --> 01:57:11,552
[SPEAKER_09]: He was like, no, I'd be pretty cool with you just sharing them around.

1384
01:57:11,973 --> 01:57:12,853
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow, very cool.

1385
01:57:13,194 --> 01:57:15,035
[SPEAKER_19]: Where can folks download this?

1386
01:57:15,255 --> 01:57:16,276
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you have it up on the web somewhere?

1387
01:57:16,336 --> 01:57:21,580
[SPEAKER_09]: No, actually I don't because I recently recut the MP3 for it.

1388
01:57:22,781 --> 01:57:26,644
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I need to give it back to Jason because he was working on the heavy steps for it.

1389
01:57:27,004 --> 01:57:30,767
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe once you guys are done, maybe we can work something out on originalsradio.com.

1390
01:57:30,787 --> 01:57:32,188
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe we can help you out.

1391
01:57:32,548 --> 01:57:33,549
[SPEAKER_19]: That'd be cool.

1392
01:57:33,849 --> 01:57:34,810
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, right on.

1393
01:57:34,890 --> 01:57:35,170
[SPEAKER_19]: Cool.

1394
01:57:36,611 --> 01:57:37,852
[SPEAKER_19]: So anything else you want to share?

1395
01:57:39,344 --> 01:57:39,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Not really.

1396
01:57:40,224 --> 01:57:45,685
[SPEAKER_09]: I got Stepmania set up for hooking it up to my TV downstairs in the basement.

1397
01:57:46,465 --> 01:57:47,166
[SPEAKER_18]: Ah, that's fun.

1398
01:57:47,346 --> 01:57:50,026
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's because I've got Joyce.

1399
01:57:51,286 --> 01:57:53,167
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got Joyce started playing DDR.

1400
01:57:53,827 --> 01:57:57,508
[SPEAKER_09]: She's only really been playing for about a month, seriously.

1401
01:57:58,008 --> 01:57:59,168
[SPEAKER_19]: And how's she doing after a month?

1402
01:58:00,048 --> 01:58:01,968
[SPEAKER_09]: She's actually just starting to get into heavy.

1403
01:58:02,008 --> 01:58:04,229
[SPEAKER_09]: She can do some six foot, some seven.

1404
01:58:04,689 --> 01:58:04,889
Hmm.

1405
01:58:05,509 --> 01:58:06,309
[SPEAKER_19]: Not bad for a month.

1406
01:58:06,349 --> 01:58:09,010
[SPEAKER_19]: God, after a month, I think I was graduating to threes.

1407
01:58:09,371 --> 01:58:10,051
[SPEAKER_19]: So very nice stuff.

1408
01:58:10,091 --> 01:58:12,652
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, she's got those Asian genes in her.

1409
01:58:15,173 --> 01:58:18,454
[SPEAKER_09]: She's half Korean, so she's got it working for her.

1410
01:58:18,634 --> 01:58:19,215
[SPEAKER_19]: Very cool.

1411
01:58:19,535 --> 01:58:19,775
[SPEAKER_19]: Good job.

1412
01:58:19,915 --> 01:58:21,356
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, Jamie just got back in the room.

1413
01:58:21,396 --> 01:58:22,436
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got to share this with Jamie.

1414
01:58:22,676 --> 01:58:29,379
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you know that Raichan and her friend Joyce, they're making Katamari hats from Katamari Damacy?

1415
01:58:29,399 --> 01:58:30,840
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, you read the journal, so you probably know.

1416
01:58:30,860 --> 01:58:31,740
[SPEAKER_19]: But isn't that so cool?

1417
01:58:34,129 --> 01:58:36,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, right now, Joyce is the only one making them.

1418
01:58:37,570 --> 01:58:37,810
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1419
01:58:38,870 --> 01:58:41,531
[SPEAKER_19]: But you're moral support, and that counts for something.

1420
01:58:42,052 --> 01:58:42,292
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1421
01:58:42,512 --> 01:58:43,312
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, very cool.

1422
01:58:43,632 --> 01:58:48,194
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, Raichan, I'm going to say goodbye, but thanks so much for calling in, and we hope to hear from you again sometime.

1423
01:58:48,814 --> 01:58:48,974
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep.

1424
01:58:49,254 --> 01:58:50,015
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, have a good one, buddy.

1425
01:58:50,555 --> 01:58:51,035
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, goodbye.

1426
01:58:51,075 --> 01:58:51,415
[SPEAKER_15]: Bye.

1427
01:58:52,896 --> 01:58:53,176
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1428
01:58:53,436 --> 01:58:55,857
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, Loki is going to finish his sim file thought.

1429
01:58:56,137 --> 01:58:59,058
[SPEAKER_17]: As I was mentioning before, there's a whole bunch of stuff...

1430
01:58:59,639 --> 01:59:03,430
[SPEAKER_17]: for those people out there that were looking for life after FoonMix.

1431
01:59:04,952 --> 01:59:11,375
[SPEAKER_17]: Starting off, there's a thread that was in Bimani Style on their DDR simulation stuff.

1432
01:59:11,896 --> 01:59:17,759
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's the Japanese DDR fan mix watch thread.

1433
01:59:18,179 --> 01:59:21,401
[SPEAKER_17]: And basically they have a few listed on here that you can go check out.

1434
01:59:21,821 --> 01:59:28,304
[SPEAKER_17]: Starting with DDR XX Mix, which is... They said they're currently testing it this week.

1435
01:59:28,624 --> 01:59:32,867
[SPEAKER_17]: And the song list so far... It's a lot of... Like...

1436
01:59:33,871 --> 01:59:34,693
[SPEAKER_17]: BMS stuff.

1437
01:59:34,773 --> 01:59:37,799
[SPEAKER_17]: It's kind of... I don't know how to really describe it.

1438
01:59:38,601 --> 01:59:41,887
[SPEAKER_17]: But they've got... Let's see here.

1439
01:59:42,729 --> 01:59:43,811
[SPEAKER_17]: They kind of reverted back.

1440
01:59:43,891 --> 01:59:44,212
[SPEAKER_17]: It was

1441
01:59:47,597 --> 01:59:56,419
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, anyways, so I played it a little earlier this week, it's pretty decent, they've got some decent files for that, with videos in the background, that kind of thing.

1442
01:59:56,439 --> 02:00:07,081
[SPEAKER_17]: Then we have DDR D3 Mix, which is, they only have really one song done on it so far, this song called J219 by Cranky, which is interesting.

1443
02:00:07,101 --> 02:00:12,622
[SPEAKER_17]: DDR E-Mix, which is all anime J-pop, if you like that kind of stuff.

1444
02:00:13,497 --> 02:00:20,782
[SPEAKER_17]: Then we have Strawberry Steps, which is kind of more like an event, not really a mix, but interesting stuff anyways.

1445
02:00:22,731 --> 02:00:28,292
[SPEAKER_17]: There was another one I found too, something about like Pop Candy or something mixed, but I don't have the link for that.

1446
02:00:28,752 --> 02:00:36,933
[SPEAKER_17]: Then there's a new theme also that's on the same thread, Step Mania Siberia style, which is basically it looks just like Techno Fiend.

1447
02:00:36,993 --> 02:00:39,194
[SPEAKER_17]: It's pretty cool to check it out.

1448
02:00:39,294 --> 02:00:44,675
[SPEAKER_17]: So, yeah, that was pretty much what was going on in the Sim scene.

1449
02:00:44,715 --> 02:00:45,415
[SPEAKER_17]: Not really much.

1450
02:00:45,755 --> 02:00:51,776
[SPEAKER_17]: Then, of course, I mentioned last week that one bondage chick thing that was retarded, but...

1451
02:00:53,277 --> 02:00:54,358
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, that's everything.

1452
02:00:55,979 --> 02:00:57,460
[SPEAKER_11]: That was someone with too much free time.

1453
02:00:59,121 --> 02:00:59,441
[SPEAKER_11]: Agreed.

1454
02:00:59,721 --> 02:01:00,602
[SPEAKER_11]: And he wasn't getting laid.

1455
02:01:02,063 --> 02:01:04,484
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, you guys want to hear who won tonight's cage match?

1456
02:01:06,906 --> 02:01:11,229
[SPEAKER_19]: Jamie says... Alright, let's find out who won tonight's cage match.

1457
02:01:11,609 --> 02:01:15,952
[SPEAKER_19]: Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new champion in the cage match this week, and it is...

1458
02:01:20,390 --> 02:01:21,891
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't fucking believe it.

1459
02:01:22,131 --> 02:01:25,854
[SPEAKER_19]: Night of Fire by a landslide even.

1460
02:01:26,474 --> 02:01:27,395
[SPEAKER_19]: By a landslide.

1461
02:01:27,435 --> 02:01:30,738
[SPEAKER_19]: The other two songs combined did not take that one out.

1462
02:01:31,278 --> 02:01:31,778
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

1463
02:01:32,058 --> 02:01:34,420
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm surprised because I just sort of threw it in.

1464
02:01:35,141 --> 02:01:36,061
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, there you have it.

1465
02:01:36,101 --> 02:01:36,742
[SPEAKER_19]: It's in there now.

1466
02:01:36,822 --> 02:01:41,886
[SPEAKER_19]: The winner, Dream, Night of Fire.

1467
02:01:43,707 --> 02:01:45,528
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to be sick more often.

1468
02:01:46,249 --> 02:01:49,191
[SPEAKER_19]: Tune in next week to see if Loki makes good on his promise.

1469
02:01:50,183 --> 02:01:53,166
[SPEAKER_19]: and maybe I'm going to make a mean pick next week too.

1470
02:01:53,206 --> 02:01:53,666
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll see.

1471
02:01:54,487 --> 02:01:54,867
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1472
02:01:58,170 --> 02:01:59,711
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's go to a break, boys and girls.

1473
02:01:59,811 --> 02:02:08,198
[SPEAKER_19]: When we come back from this break, I think it's high time we got into the FUs of the week because damn it, we're getting angsty.

1474
02:02:10,720 --> 02:02:16,045
[SPEAKER_19]: In this break, I'm doing fourth mix songs because I'm playing Hypnotic Crisis.

1475
02:02:17,208 --> 02:02:19,629
[SPEAKER_19]: and if you were here with me, the B4 Zah Mix because those songs are cool.

1476
02:02:19,689 --> 02:02:21,170
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

1477
02:02:21,210 --> 02:02:21,410
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1478
02:02:21,650 --> 02:02:22,791
[SPEAKER_11]: We need Saints Go Marching.

1479
02:02:23,871 --> 02:02:24,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we do.

1480
02:02:25,011 --> 02:02:27,413
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to do Saints Go Marching and we'll do Ninja Bro.

1481
02:02:27,673 --> 02:02:28,173
[SPEAKER_19]: Hell with it.

1482
02:02:28,233 --> 02:02:29,694
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a four song break, damn you.

1483
02:02:30,394 --> 02:02:31,434
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll be back after this.

1484
02:02:32,015 --> 02:02:33,035
[SPEAKER_19]: Get your fourth mix on.

1485
02:02:33,235 --> 02:02:34,656
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio.

1486
02:03:27,539 --> 02:03:28,141
Thanks for watching!

1487
02:04:05,441 --> 02:04:06,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

1488
02:07:21,520 --> 02:07:22,664
Thanks for watching!

1489
02:07:52,938 --> 02:07:56,449
Feel the heat, the vibration, on the streets, new situation, got the crazy car

1490
02:08:34,130 --> 02:08:40,313
[SPEAKER_18]: Gaming Radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

1491
02:08:42,795 --> 02:08:44,135
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1492
02:08:49,218 --> 02:08:51,039
[SPEAKER_19]: We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1493
02:08:51,079 --> 02:08:51,739
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you miss us?

1494
02:08:53,040 --> 02:08:53,520
[SPEAKER_19]: I hope so.

1495
02:08:54,261 --> 02:08:55,542
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds like their aim's improving.

1496
02:08:55,622 --> 02:08:56,082
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I know.

1497
02:08:56,542 --> 02:08:57,563
[SPEAKER_19]: Hopefully your aim is improving.

1498
02:08:57,743 --> 02:08:58,843
[SPEAKER_11]: Are your allergies improving yet?

1499
02:08:59,444 --> 02:09:00,244
[SPEAKER_11]: When I lay down.

1500
02:09:00,784 --> 02:09:01,945
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, well I hope you feel better.

1501
02:09:02,461 --> 02:09:07,904
[SPEAKER_11]: It's okay, I'm just laying... I'm actually... This chair is so huge that I can lay across it.

1502
02:09:09,846 --> 02:09:10,446
[SPEAKER_19]: I love that chair.

1503
02:09:10,466 --> 02:09:11,407
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty comfortable.

1504
02:09:11,907 --> 02:09:13,008
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to make love to that chair.

1505
02:09:13,568 --> 02:09:14,348
[SPEAKER_19]: Just kidding, I don't.

1506
02:09:14,448 --> 02:09:14,769
[SPEAKER_19]: Please don't.

1507
02:09:14,789 --> 02:09:15,009
[SPEAKER_19]: I won't.

1508
02:09:15,029 --> 02:09:15,689
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to sit here.

1509
02:09:15,729 --> 02:09:16,870
[SPEAKER_19]: Not while you're laying in it, anyway.

1510
02:09:18,731 --> 02:09:20,252
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm pissed off about something.

1511
02:09:22,733 --> 02:09:23,374
[SPEAKER_19]: I know, nobody cares.

1512
02:09:24,675 --> 02:09:27,016
[SPEAKER_19]: Where the fuck is Ultramix 2 Song Pack 8?

1513
02:09:27,116 --> 02:09:27,917
[SPEAKER_19]: What the fuck?

1514
02:09:27,937 --> 02:09:28,537
[SPEAKER_19]: What the fuck?

1515
02:09:30,003 --> 02:09:32,285
[SPEAKER_19]: It was announced like forever ago.

1516
02:09:33,686 --> 02:09:39,029
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, I know, from what I understand, Konami submitted it and it's Microsoft's fault.

1517
02:09:39,089 --> 02:09:40,630
[SPEAKER_19]: They're sitting on it or whatever.

1518
02:09:41,231 --> 02:09:42,111
[SPEAKER_19]: God damn it!

1519
02:09:42,452 --> 02:09:43,332
[SPEAKER_19]: Release it already.

1520
02:09:43,412 --> 02:09:46,214
[SPEAKER_19]: Listen to these songs that are going to be in Ultramix 2 song pack number 8.

1521
02:09:46,715 --> 02:09:47,855
[SPEAKER_19]: Cosmic Cowgirl.

1522
02:09:48,456 --> 02:09:49,276
[SPEAKER_19]: Love that song.

1523
02:09:49,497 --> 02:09:51,418
[SPEAKER_19]: Do I have clips of some of these songs?

1524
02:09:52,341 --> 02:09:52,942
[SPEAKER_19]: I hope I do.

1525
02:09:53,903 --> 02:09:56,266
[SPEAKER_19]: Let me see if I got a little clip of Cowgirl, or Cosmic Cowgirl.

1526
02:09:56,567 --> 02:09:57,628
[SPEAKER_19]: No, we all know Cowgirl.

1527
02:09:58,649 --> 02:10:02,655
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm thinking Cosmic Cowgirl.

1528
02:10:03,756 --> 02:10:06,339
[SPEAKER_19]: This is like all the way from Guitar Freak's, like, what, third mix?

1529
02:10:06,680 --> 02:10:09,483
[SPEAKER_11]: Cosmic Cowgirl was like my favorite song to play on Drumania.

1530
02:10:09,523 --> 02:10:09,804
[SPEAKER_19]: Here it is.

1531
02:10:21,601 --> 02:10:22,402
[SPEAKER_19]: That song rocks.

1532
02:10:23,142 --> 02:10:24,003
[SPEAKER_19]: I want that damn song.

1533
02:10:26,425 --> 02:10:29,688
[SPEAKER_19]: And then this one I can't even pronounce, but it's a fun song to play.

1534
02:10:30,189 --> 02:10:31,990
[SPEAKER_19]: Balalakia, Carried with the Wind.

1535
02:10:32,671 --> 02:10:33,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Balalakia.

1536
02:10:34,873 --> 02:10:36,334
[SPEAKER_19]: By Julianne Frost in Song Pack 8.

1537
02:10:36,855 --> 02:10:38,836
[SPEAKER_19]: More deep version 2.1.

1538
02:10:38,916 --> 02:10:39,977
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, we already have that one.

1539
02:10:39,997 --> 02:10:41,519
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not so concerned with that one.

1540
02:10:42,019 --> 02:10:44,922
[SPEAKER_19]: In My Eyes, the Neuromix by Neuropa.

1541
02:10:45,808 --> 02:10:46,528
[SPEAKER_19]: That is so cool.

1542
02:10:46,569 --> 02:10:48,750
[SPEAKER_19]: Naropa did like one of the coolest songs in Ultramix 2.

1543
02:10:48,790 --> 02:10:50,971
[SPEAKER_19]: They did Standing Still in Time and they sound like Erasure.

1544
02:10:51,271 --> 02:10:52,792
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't wait to see what they do to In My Eyes.

1545
02:10:52,852 --> 02:10:53,433
[SPEAKER_19]: It's going to rock.

1546
02:10:53,993 --> 02:10:55,834
[SPEAKER_19]: And then Kind Lady, The Interlude.

1547
02:10:57,255 --> 02:10:58,836
[SPEAKER_19]: Notice about this song pack.

1548
02:10:59,796 --> 02:11:05,640
[SPEAKER_19]: What a lot of people were bitching about with the Konami song packs is that they were recycling a lot of old garbage.

1549
02:11:06,601 --> 02:11:09,362
[SPEAKER_19]: Only one old song in this pack.

1550
02:11:09,722 --> 02:11:12,104
[SPEAKER_19]: And really, it's not even that old.

1551
02:11:12,722 --> 02:11:16,424
[SPEAKER_19]: It's only shown up in, like, what, two other releases?

1552
02:11:16,524 --> 02:11:17,565
[SPEAKER_19]: One in Japan, one in the US?

1553
02:11:18,185 --> 02:11:18,846
[SPEAKER_19]: On PS2?

1554
02:11:19,406 --> 02:11:21,047
[SPEAKER_19]: So, more Deep Version 2.1.

1555
02:11:21,107 --> 02:11:22,028
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, you've seen it before.

1556
02:11:22,648 --> 02:11:24,189
[SPEAKER_19]: But the other four are all new!

1557
02:11:25,210 --> 02:11:25,770
[SPEAKER_19]: What a deal!

1558
02:11:26,030 --> 02:11:26,670
[SPEAKER_19]: Five bucks!

1559
02:11:26,851 --> 02:11:28,171
[SPEAKER_19]: Microsoft, get up off your ass.

1560
02:11:28,211 --> 02:11:28,952
[SPEAKER_19]: Put this on the site.

1561
02:11:29,052 --> 02:11:29,692
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to download it.

1562
02:11:30,793 --> 02:11:31,313
[SPEAKER_19]: It's new!

1563
02:11:32,954 --> 02:11:33,314
[SPEAKER_19]: Damn it!

1564
02:11:35,576 --> 02:11:36,576
[SPEAKER_19]: What's wrong with you people?

1565
02:11:38,117 --> 02:11:39,078
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just really upset about this.

1566
02:11:41,567 --> 02:11:43,628
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe I have a little clip of the Kind Lady interlude, too.

1567
02:11:43,668 --> 02:11:44,968
[SPEAKER_19]: I was kind of hoping I would have one of those.

1568
02:11:46,229 --> 02:11:46,689
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know, though.

1569
02:11:47,329 --> 02:11:56,613
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe, uh... No, I only have the... I have the Japanese VRare at some point, but I think I moved it into a deep, dark directory I'm not going to find anytime soon.

1570
02:11:59,094 --> 02:12:00,835
[SPEAKER_19]: Um... Yeah.

1571
02:12:01,135 --> 02:12:02,015
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, well, maybe another time.

1572
02:12:03,056 --> 02:12:03,416
[SPEAKER_19]: It's all right.

1573
02:12:04,996 --> 02:12:08,898
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess it's time for us to get into the FUs of the week.

1574
02:12:08,918 --> 02:12:09,058
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1575
02:12:12,318 --> 02:12:12,838
[SPEAKER_19]: Sound good?

1576
02:12:13,839 --> 02:12:14,440
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't have to.

1577
02:12:14,520 --> 02:12:16,261
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, we could just, you know, end the show.

1578
02:12:17,762 --> 02:12:18,282
[SPEAKER_11]: Promise.

1579
02:12:19,043 --> 02:12:22,445
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, you guys can send your FUs of the week over to Sky in the chat room.

1580
02:12:22,905 --> 02:12:23,686
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's start it off.

1581
02:12:23,746 --> 02:12:25,007
[SPEAKER_19]: Here we go, FUs of the week.

1582
02:12:27,289 --> 02:12:28,429
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1583
02:12:28,690 --> 02:12:30,771
[SPEAKER_19]: Jamie, why do we have to do the FUs every week?

1584
02:12:35,734 --> 02:12:36,795
[SPEAKER_21]: Very good, now use your mouth.

1585
02:12:38,436 --> 02:12:39,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, this is bad.

1586
02:12:39,197 --> 02:12:40,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Here is justice.

1587
02:12:40,558 --> 02:12:41,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Here is justice.

1588
02:12:48,072 --> 02:12:49,693
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck you to my allergies.

1589
02:12:50,153 --> 02:12:50,893
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate them.

1590
02:12:51,794 --> 02:12:53,775
[SPEAKER_11]: And my cat for sleeping on my head.

1591
02:12:55,576 --> 02:12:56,656
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate my allergies.

1592
02:12:56,736 --> 02:12:58,197
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm on all kinds of drugs right now.

1593
02:12:58,237 --> 02:13:00,598
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not doing shit to make me feel better.

1594
02:13:01,939 --> 02:13:05,901
[SPEAKER_11]: Um... Also, F you to sneezing messily in my car.

1595
02:13:07,221 --> 02:13:09,442
[SPEAKER_11]: And then to stupid drivers.

1596
02:13:10,483 --> 02:13:12,404
[SPEAKER_11]: And then to my Photoshop teacher.

1597
02:13:12,424 --> 02:13:14,725
[SPEAKER_11]: Because Photoshop sucks, but he's an elitist.

1598
02:13:16,265 --> 02:13:16,365
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

1599
02:13:17,966 --> 02:13:22,269
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to the seven goblins that followed my ass through the tomb in Final Fantasy XI.

1600
02:13:22,349 --> 02:13:27,533
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope that some paladin came by and owned all your asses.

1601
02:13:28,434 --> 02:13:29,374
[SPEAKER_11]: Because you suck.

1602
02:13:32,957 --> 02:13:35,258
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to how slow leveling in that game is.

1603
02:13:36,359 --> 02:13:41,663
[SPEAKER_11]: But it is a very blessed thing that there's not so much of the Ragnarok-style newbie talk.

1604
02:13:42,263 --> 02:13:44,004
[SPEAKER_11]: Which really sucks a whole bunch of ass.

1605
02:13:45,786 --> 02:13:45,886
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

1606
02:13:48,266 --> 02:13:52,750
[SPEAKER_11]: FU to not having any real concentration.

1607
02:13:53,310 --> 02:13:57,894
[SPEAKER_11]: Other situations that I can't really do anything about.

1608
02:14:00,456 --> 02:14:05,940
[SPEAKER_11]: FU to GameStop just for a situation involving my fiancé.

1609
02:14:10,123 --> 02:14:12,325
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's really it.

1610
02:14:14,506 --> 02:14:17,869
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, then let's go over to our buddy Loki with his FUs of the week.

1611
02:14:21,874 --> 02:14:23,135
[SPEAKER_17]: Fucking A, okay?

1612
02:14:23,235 --> 02:14:28,821
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, first off, fucking A-Bit for, um, creating... I think it was A-Bit, I don't even remember.

1613
02:14:28,961 --> 02:14:29,522
[SPEAKER_17]: No, A.S.

1614
02:14:30,262 --> 02:14:30,603
[SPEAKER_17]: Rock.

1615
02:14:31,243 --> 02:14:36,188
[SPEAKER_17]: For creating a stupid motherboard with, you know, five different places to put RAM.

1616
02:14:36,969 --> 02:14:41,173
[SPEAKER_17]: And for confusing me for hours because I put the RAM in the wrong spot.

1617
02:14:42,374 --> 02:14:42,595
[SPEAKER_17]: Dope.

1618
02:14:44,056 --> 02:14:44,557
Anyway.

1619
02:14:45,217 --> 02:14:45,798
[SPEAKER_17]: And, um...

1620
02:14:46,779 --> 02:14:53,901
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, basically just fucking using my crazy sleep schedule because I'm going to be so tired tomorrow.

1621
02:14:54,541 --> 02:14:59,722
[SPEAKER_17]: Not that I really care because it'll be fine because everyone will be getting mad at Erica because I was leaving for my work.

1622
02:15:00,542 --> 02:15:06,384
[SPEAKER_17]: And fucking using my goddamn case because I had to get another...

1623
02:15:07,079 --> 02:15:07,639
[SPEAKER_17]: No, they don't.

1624
02:15:07,659 --> 02:15:07,999
[SPEAKER_17]: They get worse.

1625
02:15:08,039 --> 02:15:08,079
[SPEAKER_17]: Um...

1626
02:15:33,918 --> 02:15:40,503
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd like to give an F you to the government for getting one of my high school friends killed in Iraq.

1627
02:15:40,743 --> 02:15:41,443
[SPEAKER_19]: That kind of sucks.

1628
02:15:41,904 --> 02:15:42,184
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1629
02:15:43,004 --> 02:15:44,245
[SPEAKER_19]: So, F you to the government.

1630
02:15:45,246 --> 02:15:46,767
[SPEAKER_19]: F you to Bush while I'm at it, because I don't like him.

1631
02:15:46,807 --> 02:15:47,147
[SPEAKER_19]: I never did.

1632
02:15:48,488 --> 02:15:52,031
[SPEAKER_19]: And F you to the fact that I have to get up and go to work early tomorrow.

1633
02:15:52,051 --> 02:15:52,471
[SPEAKER_19]: That sucks.

1634
02:15:52,531 --> 02:15:53,071
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't like that.

1635
02:15:54,452 --> 02:15:57,875
[SPEAKER_19]: F you to me being lazy.

1636
02:15:58,115 --> 02:16:00,016
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not getting anything accomplished, but that's my own damn fault.

1637
02:16:00,036 --> 02:16:00,756
[SPEAKER_19]: So, F you to myself.

1638
02:16:01,817 --> 02:16:01,977
[SPEAKER_19]: And...

1639
02:16:03,636 --> 02:16:04,356
[SPEAKER_19]: F you to Angst!

1640
02:16:05,477 --> 02:16:06,297
[SPEAKER_19]: I've had a lot of it lately.

1641
02:16:07,537 --> 02:16:09,058
[SPEAKER_19]: But I hide it really good on this show.

1642
02:16:10,118 --> 02:16:12,539
[SPEAKER_19]: But secretly I'm plotting to kill each and every one of you.

1643
02:16:13,079 --> 02:16:13,479
[SPEAKER_19]: Just kidding.

1644
02:16:13,679 --> 02:16:13,979
[SPEAKER_19]: Love ya.

1645
02:16:14,619 --> 02:16:15,280
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for the warning.

1646
02:16:15,380 --> 02:16:15,760
[SPEAKER_19]: You're welcome.

1647
02:16:16,300 --> 02:16:18,521
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's see what the other folks in the studio have to say.

1648
02:16:18,601 --> 02:16:19,381
[SPEAKER_19]: Starting with Bugged.

1649
02:16:20,281 --> 02:16:21,502
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, double F you to the government.

1650
02:16:21,522 --> 02:16:22,882
[SPEAKER_21]: He was a very good high school buddy.

1651
02:16:23,782 --> 02:16:28,144
[SPEAKER_21]: And I've heard from various people that I haven't heard it from in ten years.

1652
02:16:28,304 --> 02:16:30,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

1653
02:16:31,685 --> 02:16:32,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, shit.

1654
02:16:33,359 --> 02:16:38,763
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, it was a very strange phone call today, because this person was very close to the friend who died.

1655
02:16:40,044 --> 02:16:44,007
[SPEAKER_21]: It was strange.

1656
02:16:44,027 --> 02:16:47,350
[SPEAKER_21]: FU to diesel prices, as always.

1657
02:16:49,552 --> 02:16:51,993
[SPEAKER_21]: Not FU to running diesel.

1658
02:16:53,775 --> 02:16:56,117
[SPEAKER_19]: We still get way good miles to the gallon, so shut up.

1659
02:16:56,317 --> 02:16:57,398
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I do.

1660
02:16:57,478 --> 02:16:57,958
[SPEAKER_21]: I get 40.

1661
02:16:58,338 --> 02:17:00,280
[SPEAKER_21]: And FU to Johnny Carson dying.

1662
02:17:00,880 --> 02:17:01,521
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, that sucked, too.

1663
02:17:02,711 --> 02:17:05,132
[SPEAKER_19]: We did a memorial last week, but that still sucks.

1664
02:17:06,792 --> 02:17:07,452
[SPEAKER_21]: I wasn't running.

1665
02:17:08,172 --> 02:17:08,592
[SPEAKER_19]: That's alright.

1666
02:17:09,153 --> 02:17:11,933
[SPEAKER_21]: And, uh, pretty good week.

1667
02:17:12,213 --> 02:17:14,054
[SPEAKER_21]: I need to bring the hard drive to my iMac.

1668
02:17:15,414 --> 02:17:22,915
[SPEAKER_21]: I saved a laptop by pulling the hard drive out, moving files over for a UC Davis College student.

1669
02:17:22,935 --> 02:17:23,956
[SPEAKER_21]: Putting them on my elder iMac.

1670
02:17:24,016 --> 02:17:24,476
[SPEAKER_21]: I've had words.

1671
02:17:24,496 --> 02:17:27,476
[SPEAKER_21]: She was happy she had a computer that worked.

1672
02:17:27,496 --> 02:17:28,837
[SPEAKER_21]: She didn't want to talk about it.

1673
02:17:32,998 --> 02:17:43,282
[SPEAKER_20]: FU to people who have a problem with me and won't come to me and come to my friends instead, that's all I have to say

1674
02:18:00,137 --> 02:18:02,442
[SPEAKER_19]: about the FUs of the Week segment here on this program.

1675
02:18:02,483 --> 02:18:04,126
[SPEAKER_19]: Let me get my reminder music up.

1676
02:18:04,206 --> 02:18:06,251
[SPEAKER_19]: If I could do this here.

1677
02:18:12,455 --> 02:18:21,799
[SPEAKER_19]: Boys and girls, we here at Orange Lounge Radio do the FUs of the week as a service to you and ourselves because we certainly get a load off of our chest.

1678
02:18:21,859 --> 02:18:28,782
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, luckily, we're a small program and nobody listens to us, so pretty much anybody who submits their FUs will get it right on the air.

1679
02:18:29,242 --> 02:18:31,903
[SPEAKER_19]: One day, we will be bigger than God and...

1680
02:18:32,927 --> 02:18:35,168
[SPEAKER_19]: We're not going to read your FUs anymore because we won't have the time.

1681
02:18:35,408 --> 02:18:37,749
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll have a little dark corner of the website where you can post them.

1682
02:18:38,069 --> 02:18:40,030
[SPEAKER_19]: But for now, we read your FUs on the air.

1683
02:18:40,310 --> 02:18:42,291
[SPEAKER_19]: However, there are some exceptions to this rule.

1684
02:18:42,731 --> 02:18:45,612
[SPEAKER_19]: We do not read FUs of a personal nature.

1685
02:18:45,972 --> 02:18:50,354
[SPEAKER_19]: In other words, if you're going to rant about somebody else, we're not going to read that FU on the air.

1686
02:18:50,414 --> 02:18:51,814
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, of course, there's exceptions to every rule.

1687
02:18:52,174 --> 02:18:56,916
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're going to rant about your teacher, we'll read that FU because, you know what, your teacher doesn't like you either.

1688
02:18:57,256 --> 02:18:58,477
[SPEAKER_19]: So, fine, we'll read that FU.

1689
02:18:59,611 --> 02:19:00,532
[SPEAKER_19]: FUs to your parents.

1690
02:19:00,832 --> 02:19:03,274
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, everybody has FUs about their parents once in a while.

1691
02:19:03,534 --> 02:19:05,656
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, you love your parents, but some days you want to kill them.

1692
02:19:06,016 --> 02:19:06,437
[SPEAKER_19]: Guess what?

1693
02:19:06,477 --> 02:19:07,878
[SPEAKER_19]: They feel the same way about you.

1694
02:19:08,858 --> 02:19:12,401
[SPEAKER_19]: They love you most days, but some days they want to kill you and wish you'd never been born.

1695
02:19:13,082 --> 02:19:16,204
[SPEAKER_19]: So we will allow the FUs to teachers and parents and bosses.

1696
02:19:16,504 --> 02:19:17,405
[SPEAKER_19]: We all hate our boss.

1697
02:19:17,545 --> 02:19:18,646
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, I love my boss.

1698
02:19:18,826 --> 02:19:20,468
[SPEAKER_19]: I love my boss.

1699
02:19:20,708 --> 02:19:21,468
[SPEAKER_19]: I love people I work with.

1700
02:19:21,709 --> 02:19:23,670
[SPEAKER_19]: But I know a lot of you work in retail, so you don't.

1701
02:19:24,010 --> 02:19:24,591
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's fine.

1702
02:19:24,891 --> 02:19:25,912
[SPEAKER_19]: You can give an FU to your boss.

1703
02:19:27,293 --> 02:19:28,834
[SPEAKER_19]: Those types of FUs are fine.

1704
02:19:29,134 --> 02:19:40,080
[SPEAKER_19]: However, if you're going to give an FU to like an ex-boyfriend, or an ex-girlfriend, or an ex-best friend, or an ex-wife, well, some exceptions.

1705
02:19:40,701 --> 02:19:43,763
[SPEAKER_19]: I still let some exceptions even with that.

1706
02:19:43,843 --> 02:19:49,186
[SPEAKER_19]: But, for the most part, if you want to give an FU about those types of things, let me give you a phone number.

1707
02:19:49,206 --> 02:19:49,986
[SPEAKER_19]: 1-800-96-JERRY Okay?

1708
02:19:54,409 --> 02:19:56,250
[SPEAKER_19]: That is where you can go to handle your problems.

1709
02:19:56,390 --> 02:19:59,092
[SPEAKER_19]: Please, do not send them care of Orange Lounge Radio.

1710
02:19:59,352 --> 02:20:01,113
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't want to get caught in the middle of your bullshit.

1711
02:20:01,453 --> 02:20:01,753
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1712
02:20:03,874 --> 02:20:05,495
[SPEAKER_19]: And now, the chatroom FUs of the week.

1713
02:20:09,618 --> 02:20:10,238
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's see.

1714
02:20:10,818 --> 02:20:13,760
[SPEAKER_19]: VXJasonXV says, FU to Tifa.

1715
02:20:14,240 --> 02:20:14,581
[SPEAKER_19]: That's all.

1716
02:20:15,741 --> 02:20:17,642
[SPEAKER_19]: Rai Chan says, oh, Joyce first.

1717
02:20:17,662 --> 02:20:18,543
[SPEAKER_19]: She's sending Joyce's.

1718
02:20:19,606 --> 02:20:26,911
[SPEAKER_19]: Joy says, F you to sick, demented fruitcakes that feel they can abuse animals and then don't even bother taking them to a shelter and leave them to fend for themselves.

1719
02:20:27,111 --> 02:20:27,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1720
02:20:28,932 --> 02:20:32,514
[SPEAKER_19]: Rychan says, F you to all the people at Walmart on Sunday afternoons.

1721
02:20:32,614 --> 02:20:33,274
[SPEAKER_19]: Come on, people.

1722
02:20:33,615 --> 02:20:38,978
[SPEAKER_19]: There has to be something better for you to do than stand in the middle of the aisle while your children run around like they're in a playground.

1723
02:20:40,646 --> 02:20:50,310
[SPEAKER_19]: BRP Ohio Bomani, the Big Red Pimp, says F you to Food Network for showing stupid American football party specials that make him wait for Iron Chef America to come on again.

1724
02:20:50,390 --> 02:20:51,391
[SPEAKER_19]: Flay vs. Ming.

1725
02:20:54,572 --> 02:20:54,912
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1726
02:20:56,453 --> 02:21:02,436
[SPEAKER_19]: Illusion says F you to the Super Blue Sphere levels in Sonic 3 and Knuckles for being so damn hard to beat.

1727
02:21:03,050 --> 02:21:10,393
[SPEAKER_19]: and FU to my cousin, though more of an in-your-face FU because we played Texas Hold'em last night and I started with 18 pennies and ended up with 80.

1728
02:21:11,054 --> 02:21:12,134
[SPEAKER_19]: Flush that, you bitch!

1729
02:21:14,275 --> 02:21:23,119
[SPEAKER_19]: Dark Knight says FU to freeze my ass off because of this weather and FU to school for screwing up my financial aid because without the aid I can't attend college for the summer now.

1730
02:21:25,487 --> 02:21:53,395

1731
02:21:54,491 --> 02:21:57,812
[SPEAKER_19]: FU to... Oh, that is a personal FU.

1732
02:21:58,273 --> 02:21:58,533
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry.

[SPEAKER_19]: Dork says FU to girls.

[SPEAKER_19]: Lovely.

[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you guys for sharing your FUs with us.

1739
02:22:13,158 --> 02:22:14,739
[SPEAKER_19]: We feel your angst.

1740
02:22:15,879 --> 02:22:16,800
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, Jamie has another one.

1741
02:22:17,340 --> 02:22:18,040
[SPEAKER_19]: Let me get your song.

1742
02:22:18,400 --> 02:22:19,561
[SPEAKER_11]: No, you don't need to.

1743
02:22:19,661 --> 02:22:20,501
[SPEAKER_11]: Just to myself.

1744
02:22:20,701 --> 02:22:20,961
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1745
02:22:22,282 --> 02:22:22,482
[SPEAKER_19]: Why?

1746
02:22:22,502 --> 02:22:22,562
[SPEAKER_19]: Why?

1747
02:22:24,969 --> 02:22:25,409
[SPEAKER_19]: Why?

1748
02:22:25,990 --> 02:22:26,911
[SPEAKER_19]: But we love you, Jamie.

1749
02:22:36,938 --> 02:22:37,479
[SPEAKER_19]: When in doubt.

1750
02:22:37,879 --> 02:22:38,219
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1751
02:22:38,560 --> 02:22:39,901
[SPEAKER_11]: When in doubt, haunt people.

1752
02:22:41,622 --> 02:22:42,143
[SPEAKER_19]: Hear, hear.

1753
02:22:44,364 --> 02:22:45,005
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's see.

1754
02:22:45,125 --> 02:22:45,765
[SPEAKER_11]: He's a stalker.

1755
02:22:47,126 --> 02:22:48,808
[SPEAKER_19]: I think you have a couple in our chat room.

1756
02:22:48,848 --> 02:22:51,230
[SPEAKER_19]: I think Phoenix, well, Phoenix said he was a fanboy.

1757
02:22:51,250 --> 02:22:51,630
[SPEAKER_19]: He's a stalker.

1758
02:22:52,515 --> 02:22:54,195
[SPEAKER_19]: I think he's more of a fanboy than a stalker.

1759
02:22:54,556 --> 02:22:55,536
[SPEAKER_19]: You want a stalker?

1760
02:22:56,196 --> 02:22:59,397
[SPEAKER_11]: I do, just because it would be fun and interesting.

1761
02:22:59,717 --> 02:23:03,738
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I could hunt them down and kill them as revenge.

1762
02:23:04,438 --> 02:23:05,438
[SPEAKER_11]: And then get on the news.

1763
02:23:09,219 --> 02:23:13,160
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, if you want to stalk Jamie, send those emails to jamie at orangeloungeradio.com

1764
02:23:14,696 --> 02:23:19,421
[SPEAKER_19]: And did you know it'll also work for Rob at OrangeLaunchRadio.com or Loki at OrangeLaunchRadio.com?

1765
02:23:19,701 --> 02:23:20,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I agree.

1766
02:23:21,082 --> 02:23:26,608
[SPEAKER_11]: If anyone puts a personal F you in, again, we stick a Nevada-ton on them.

1767
02:23:30,071 --> 02:23:31,533
[SPEAKER_11]: She can go after them with a box cutter.

1768
02:23:32,013 --> 02:23:32,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

1769
02:23:35,003 --> 02:23:38,185
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, did you know that the DanceMania folks updated their website?

1770
02:23:38,225 --> 02:23:42,127
[SPEAKER_19]: DanceMania, you know, being the series that DDR got a lot of its music from in Japan.

1771

[SPEAKER_19]: Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

1774
02:23:49,651 --> 02:23:51,712
[SPEAKER_19]: No, it's a lot of really interesting old songs.

[SPEAKER_19]: Listen to some of these songs that are on the CD.

[SPEAKER_19]: A lot of these songs show up on a lot of dance media albums.

02:24:13,074 --> 02:24:15,515
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, that song is on like... Rai Chan is my official stalker now.

1782
02:24:15,855 --> 02:24:16,175
[SPEAKER_19]: Who is?

1783
02:24:16,395 --> 02:24:16,796

[SPEAKER_19]: Telephone Operator by Pete Shelley.

1790
02:24:29,149 --> 02:24:33,051
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that song's been in just about every other Dance Mania CD.

1791
02:24:33,551 --> 02:24:35,132
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, and this is so cool.

1792

[SPEAKER_19]: Madness within the city.

1793
02:24:38,434 --> 02:24:39,354
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not our house.

1794
02:24:39,454 --> 02:24:40,054
[SPEAKER_19]: It's in the city.

1795
02:24:42,135 --> 02:24:43,116
[SPEAKER_21]: Madness had another song.

1796
02:24:43,256 --> 02:24:43,716
[SPEAKER_19]: I know.

[SPEAKER_19]: Abracadabra.

1799
02:24:54,102 --> 02:24:54,382
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1800
02:24:54,969 --> 02:24:57,471
[SPEAKER_19]: We got to go to a break because Jamie's foaming at the mouth.

1801
02:24:57,511 --> 02:24:58,832
[SPEAKER_19]: She wants to get into the chat room.

1802
02:24:59,732 --> 02:25:04,316
[SPEAKER_19]: She's going to regulate, so we have to log out on the main screen so we can get her in.

1803
02:25:04,896 --> 02:25:08,178
[SPEAKER_19]: She wants to be cyber-stalked by those of you guys, so we got to make it work.

1804
02:25:08,198 --> 02:25:10,420
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, apparently we're not doing a good enough job for her in person.

1805
02:25:11,881 --> 02:25:16,404
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, we're going to play some Euromix songs in this break because I want to hear Video Kill the Radio Star.

1806
02:25:17,064 --> 02:25:19,926
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're going to do some varying Euromix tracks.

1807
02:25:22,368 --> 02:25:23,629
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we'll be back.

1808
02:25:25,675 --> 02:25:28,942
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, and Jamie wants to hear Kids in America, so I guess we can pull that song in there too.

1809
02:25:31,647 --> 02:25:34,513
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

1816
02:30:11,343 --> 02:30:23,807

[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, Dark Knight, send me a private message with more information on what you're saying in chatroom.

1862
02:35:35,281 --> 02:35:36,401
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm too lazy to type right now.

1863
02:35:36,942 --> 02:35:37,502
[SPEAKER_19]: This is great.

1864
02:35:37,802 --> 02:35:40,864
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just going to talk to the chatroom tonight.

1865
02:35:43,265 --> 02:35:43,846
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, forget it.

1866
02:35:46,447 --> 02:35:51,330
[SPEAKER_19]: But Dark Knight, send me a private message with a link to more information and I will do so.

1867
02:35:54,403 --> 02:35:56,305
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, let's get into Ask Orange Lounge.

1868
02:35:56,325 --> 02:35:59,447
[SPEAKER_19]: This is your opportunity to ask us some stuff.

1869
02:36:07,054 --> 02:36:09,957
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

1870
02:36:10,497 --> 02:36:13,720
[SPEAKER_19]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

1871
02:36:14,421 --> 02:36:17,463
[SPEAKER_19]: Will we find the cure to Jamie's allergies?

1872
02:36:17,944 --> 02:36:21,227
[SPEAKER_19]: Or will we find a cure for Matt's big angst?

1873
02:36:25,977 --> 02:36:28,458
[SPEAKER_19]: There's no cure, no cure The easy answer I have to that is yes

1874
02:36:47,349 --> 02:36:48,990
[SPEAKER_11]: We already have a podcast-only segment.

1875
02:37:12,395 --> 02:37:17,878
[SPEAKER_19]: Remember, the cage match didn't show up until episode 20, and some of the segments, you know, it didn't show up until later on.

1876
02:37:18,538 --> 02:37:19,419
[SPEAKER_19]: And now we whore them out.

1877
02:37:19,459 --> 02:37:21,400
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, if we didn't have these segments, we wouldn't have a show.

1878
02:37:21,880 --> 02:37:23,301
[SPEAKER_19]: The podcast will do the same thing.

1879
02:37:24,341 --> 02:37:33,506
[SPEAKER_19]: The other cool thing about the podcast is that it's very flexible, is that we could, if we wanted to, if we were on the road somewhere...

1880
02:37:34,364 --> 02:37:38,066
[SPEAKER_19]: Loki's trying to build us an on-the-road computer that's going to be inside an Xbox.

1881
02:37:38,127 --> 02:37:40,568
[SPEAKER_19]: In fact, if you look on cam, you can kind of see Loki's head.

1882
02:37:40,888 --> 02:37:41,869
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what he's working on right now.

1883
02:37:41,889 --> 02:37:43,150
[SPEAKER_19]: He's working on the Xbox PC.

1884
02:37:43,610 --> 02:37:50,535
[SPEAKER_19]: We have a plan that this year from E3, we're going to be giving you updates via the podcast every day on what we've seen at E3.

1885
02:37:52,305 --> 02:38:01,110
[SPEAKER_19]: Honestly, if you were to watch this coverage on television, on one of the tech stations on TV, you'd be waiting a couple weeks to a month to be seeing these sorts of updates.

1886
02:38:01,710 --> 02:38:05,592
[SPEAKER_19]: If you were to be reading about it in a magazine, you'd be waiting like six to eight weeks to see this stuff.

1887
02:38:05,932 --> 02:38:08,834
[SPEAKER_19]: Even other websites take a couple days sometimes.

1888
02:38:09,254 --> 02:38:15,217
[SPEAKER_19]: We will have live audio from E3 the same damn day.

1889
02:38:15,857 --> 02:38:16,518
[SPEAKER_19]: It's going to rock.

1890
02:38:17,138 --> 02:38:19,239
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the kind of cool stuff the podcast is going to present.

1891
02:38:19,299 --> 02:38:20,400
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what we're planning to do.

1892
02:38:20,900 --> 02:38:21,060
[SPEAKER_19]: So...

1893
02:38:22,631 --> 02:38:23,472
[SPEAKER_19]: All those sorts of things.

1894
02:38:23,552 --> 02:38:24,273
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you very much.

1895
02:38:24,513 --> 02:38:25,193
[SPEAKER_19]: Hugs and kisses.

1896
02:38:26,815 --> 02:38:27,075
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

1897
02:38:28,516 --> 02:38:30,658
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's get to some more questions here.

1898
02:38:31,839 --> 02:38:34,161
[SPEAKER_19]: What else do you guys think could be done with the podcast?

1899
02:38:34,202 --> 02:38:37,625
[SPEAKER_19]: Anything you guys want to add to that?

1900
02:38:40,287 --> 02:38:43,830
[SPEAKER_11]: We could even do other podcasts for some of our spin-off shows.

1901
02:38:45,892 --> 02:38:47,534
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, we do have that ability, honestly.

1902
02:38:48,074 --> 02:38:49,035
[SPEAKER_19]: So we shall see.

1903
02:38:51,593 --> 02:38:51,973
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1904
02:38:57,256 --> 02:38:57,957
[SPEAKER_19]: Dead air, dead air.

1905
02:38:57,977 --> 02:39:02,139
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry, I'm posting a link in our chat room right now on how folks can help.

1906
02:39:02,259 --> 02:39:04,100
[SPEAKER_11]: I can make the grudge sound again.

[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if you took apart a laptop battery.

1910
02:39:10,964 --> 02:39:11,464
[SPEAKER_17]: That's fun.

1911
02:39:12,285 --> 02:39:12,905
[SPEAKER_17]: What?

1912
02:39:13,265 --> 02:39:15,246
[SPEAKER_17]: I said I just took apart a laptop battery.

1913
02:39:15,286 --> 02:39:15,887
[SPEAKER_17]: That's fun.

1914
02:39:16,147 --> 02:39:16,387
[SPEAKER_17]: Fun.

1915
02:39:16,447 --> 02:39:17,027
[SPEAKER_17]: What's inside?

1916
02:39:17,668 --> 02:39:18,128
[SPEAKER_17]: Batteries.

1917
02:39:19,906 --> 02:39:21,247
[SPEAKER_17]: Scary stuff that could hurt me.

1918
02:39:23,007 --> 02:39:24,668
[SPEAKER_19]: Legend of Zaku has a question.

1919
02:39:24,788 --> 02:39:29,791
[SPEAKER_19]: What licensed songs would you like to see on an American 2DX mix if it happens?

1920
02:39:32,072 --> 02:39:34,313
[SPEAKER_19]: Any requests for an... Shaft.

1921
02:39:35,413 --> 02:39:36,494
[SPEAKER_19]: The theme from Shaft.

1922
02:39:36,874 --> 02:39:38,394
[SPEAKER_19]: Jamie says Temple of Butt.

1923
02:39:38,715 --> 02:39:39,995
[SPEAKER_19]: She's yelling from the laundry room.

1924
02:39:40,295 --> 02:39:41,236
[SPEAKER_19]: Angel, anything you want to see?

1925
02:39:44,697 --> 02:39:45,178
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1926
02:39:45,198 --> 02:39:45,798
[SPEAKER_10]: All of a sudden I...

1927
02:39:46,673 --> 02:39:50,736
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought of the BT song from Extreme.

1928
02:39:50,876 --> 02:39:52,558
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know why, I just kind of thought of it.

1929
02:39:52,638 --> 02:39:53,678
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1930
02:39:53,718 --> 02:39:54,419
[SPEAKER_19]: Simply Being Loved.

1931
02:39:55,019 --> 02:39:57,241
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I was going to say that, but I don't know.

1932
02:39:58,782 --> 02:40:01,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Either that or just something different.

1933
02:40:01,504 --> 02:40:01,825
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1934
02:40:02,265 --> 02:40:04,146
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, Skull could be actually kind of fun to play.

1935
02:40:04,307 --> 02:40:05,307
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh my god, yes.

1936
02:40:06,969 --> 02:40:07,629
[SPEAKER_19]: Any echo image.

1937
02:40:08,750 --> 02:40:12,113
[SPEAKER_19]: Just mix, just honestly, team up with a different drum.

1938
02:40:12,553 --> 02:40:13,774
[SPEAKER_19]: Let Konami Hawaii do it.

1939
02:40:15,175 --> 02:40:16,436
[SPEAKER_19]: And team up with a different drum.

1940
02:40:17,148 --> 02:40:18,189
[SPEAKER_19]: because that would be so hot.

1941
02:40:19,870 --> 02:40:22,172
[SPEAKER_19]: So that and what other songs would be good?

1942
02:40:23,773 --> 02:40:27,596
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, a lot of the crossovers they've had in DDR might be fun, like Dirty Vegas would be kind of cute.

1943
02:40:29,037 --> 02:40:29,858
[SPEAKER_19]: What else would be fun?

1944
02:40:30,338 --> 02:40:32,280
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm trying to think of songs that haven't really been in DDR yet.

1945
02:40:33,260 --> 02:40:34,041
[SPEAKER_19]: Or 2DX.

1946
02:40:34,501 --> 02:40:35,202
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, you know what?

1947
02:40:35,262 --> 02:40:40,826
[SPEAKER_19]: Even though this song's already been in 2DX and it's a really horrid song, I really want to see it in 2DX USA.

1948
02:40:41,327 --> 02:40:41,907
Deadline.

1949
02:40:42,468 --> 02:40:43,128
I love Deadline.

1950
02:40:44,129 --> 02:40:44,349
Love it.

1951
02:40:46,551 --> 02:40:46,691
[SPEAKER_19]: Um...

1952
02:40:48,755 --> 02:40:54,897
[SPEAKER_19]: Honestly, just go to like Robbins Entertainment and just put anything from those dance compilations.

1953
02:40:55,217 --> 02:40:57,778
[SPEAKER_19]: Just give us some Lasco, some Ian Vandal.

1954
02:40:58,379 --> 02:40:58,859
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't care.

1955
02:40:59,679 --> 02:41:00,639
[SPEAKER_19]: All that stuff would be cool.

1956
02:41:01,140 --> 02:41:03,300
[SPEAKER_19]: I want that Come Into My Dream song by Froggy.

1957
02:41:03,641 --> 02:41:05,041
[SPEAKER_19]: Come into my dream.

1958
02:41:05,061 --> 02:41:06,482
[SPEAKER_19]: Because that has a really cool beat to it.

1959
02:41:06,682 --> 02:41:08,602
[SPEAKER_19]: Ooh, definitely do that.

1960
02:41:11,904 --> 02:41:13,964
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, let's see.

1961
02:41:14,645 --> 02:41:15,685
[SPEAKER_19]: Illusion has a question.

1962
02:41:17,384 --> 02:41:23,629
[SPEAKER_19]: Illusion wants to know, okay, he's done a lot of soul searching here, and he's wanted to ask this question for the longest time.

1963
02:41:24,189 --> 02:41:29,033
[SPEAKER_19]: Weeks have gone by, sleepless nights, because I couldn't ask this question, he says.

1964
02:41:29,573 --> 02:41:30,694
[SPEAKER_19]: Here is his question.

1965
02:41:31,634 --> 02:41:34,076
[SPEAKER_19]: Is Jem truly outrageous?

1966
02:41:35,797 --> 02:41:37,218
[SPEAKER_11]: Truly, truly outrageous.

1967
02:41:38,199 --> 02:41:39,160
[SPEAKER_17]: Jem is adventure.

1968
02:41:39,560 --> 02:41:40,381
[SPEAKER_17]: Jem is excitement.

1969
02:41:41,321 --> 02:41:42,342
[SPEAKER_17]: Jem is lame.

1970
02:41:42,762 --> 02:41:43,663
[SPEAKER_11]: Jem is not lame!

1971
02:41:44,063 --> 02:41:46,205
[SPEAKER_11]: She is not, but the dolls have really huge heads.

1972
02:41:47,830 --> 02:41:49,832
[SPEAKER_19]: But the misfits, their songs are better.

1973
02:41:50,353 --> 02:41:51,073
[SPEAKER_19]: And they're going to get her.

1974
02:41:51,694 --> 02:41:56,719
[SPEAKER_11]: It was all about later in the series when Jetta showed up and played that black saxophone.

1975
02:41:56,799 --> 02:41:58,421
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, my hero forever.

1976
02:42:03,226 --> 02:42:03,686
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what?

1977
02:42:04,147 --> 02:42:10,093
[SPEAKER_19]: Since we got some extra time here, since we haven't gotten a whole lot of questions, I have to play at least a little clip of this because this is so cool.

1978
02:42:10,876 --> 02:42:12,397
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys know Freeze Pop, right?

1979
02:42:12,857 --> 02:42:19,719
[SPEAKER_19]: They're the band that did Super Sprode and Science Genius Girl.

1980
02:42:20,279 --> 02:42:22,180
[SPEAKER_19]: You know they've got like two full albums, right?

1981
02:42:23,320 --> 02:42:23,580
[SPEAKER_19]: What?

1982
02:42:26,101 --> 02:42:26,961
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, Shark Attack.

1983
02:42:27,101 --> 02:42:28,342
[SPEAKER_19]: They've got other songs.

1984
02:42:28,762 --> 02:42:31,002
[SPEAKER_19]: But one of the songs they do is so cool.

1985
02:42:31,022 --> 02:42:31,763
[SPEAKER_19]: You've got to hear this.

1986
02:42:32,423 --> 02:42:33,983
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got to find the directory it's in, though.

1987
02:42:34,804 --> 02:42:36,504
[SPEAKER_19]: My computer's a big fat mess right now.

1988
02:42:37,004 --> 02:42:38,665
[SPEAKER_19]: It is actually a cover...

1989
02:42:39,838 --> 02:42:40,478
[SPEAKER_19]: You're not going to believe this.

1990
02:42:40,779 --> 02:42:42,700
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a cover of the Gem theme song.

1991
02:42:43,760 --> 02:42:44,561
[SPEAKER_11]: That is awesome.

1992
02:42:44,681 --> 02:42:45,041
[SPEAKER_11]: Play it.

1993
02:42:45,201 --> 02:42:46,462
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to play a little clip of it.

1994
02:42:46,482 --> 02:42:47,983
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, I'm only going to play like the first verse.

1995
02:42:48,223 --> 02:42:48,503
[SPEAKER_19]: Here it is.

1996
02:43:04,918 --> 02:43:14,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Jem, Jem is excitement, Jem, Jem is adventure, Jem, Jem is truly outrageous, truly, truly, truly outrageous, Jem, Jem is my name, no one else is the same,

1997
02:43:46,226 --> 02:43:49,009
[SPEAKER_19]: Come on, they're the misfits, they're gonna get her.

1998
02:43:49,789 --> 02:43:50,430
[SPEAKER_19]: Isn't that cool?

1999
02:43:51,431 --> 02:43:53,653
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I have to tell a little story about Freeze Pop.

2000
02:43:53,773 --> 02:43:54,874
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, tell a story about Freeze Pop.

2001
02:43:55,074 --> 02:44:07,025
[SPEAKER_21]: Freeze Pop is from Boston, I have a bunch of friends in Boston, and they were, my friends were at a club, and this guy was going off about how he hates, hates Freeze Pop because they sound so fake.

2002
02:44:07,779 --> 02:44:11,280
[SPEAKER_21]: Meanwhile, the lead singer of Freeze Pop was standing behind him just fuming.

2003
02:44:13,461 --> 02:44:13,741
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

2004
02:44:14,701 --> 02:44:16,222
[SPEAKER_21]: And apparently she could really kick ass.

2005
02:44:17,162 --> 02:44:17,542
[SPEAKER_21]: Did she?

2006
02:44:17,942 --> 02:44:18,702
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't believe so.

2007
02:44:18,802 --> 02:44:20,223
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, Freeze Pop is so awesome.

2008
02:44:20,403 --> 02:44:26,545
[SPEAKER_21]: It was pointed out that the lead singer that he really hates the sound of was standing right behind him, and I guess he left.

2009
02:44:27,445 --> 02:44:28,625
[SPEAKER_21]: Much to his own behest.

2010
02:44:29,406 --> 02:44:31,346
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh my god, we need to get Freeze Pop on this show.

2011
02:44:33,807 --> 02:44:36,008
[SPEAKER_19]: I doubt that's even possible, but I would try.

2012
02:44:36,028 --> 02:44:36,988
[SPEAKER_21]: They tend to stick around Boston.

2013
02:44:37,859 --> 02:44:38,959
[SPEAKER_19]: No, they don't have to be here.

2014
02:44:39,260 --> 02:44:40,320
[SPEAKER_19]: We do have the phone thing.

2015
02:44:40,740 --> 02:44:41,300
[SPEAKER_21]: You can Skype them.

2016
02:44:41,540 --> 02:44:42,241
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, see?

2017
02:44:42,701 --> 02:44:43,901
[SPEAKER_19]: We got MidiHead on this show.

2018
02:44:44,101 --> 02:44:44,441
[SPEAKER_19]: Damn it.

2019
02:44:44,701 --> 02:44:45,502
[SPEAKER_19]: Anything's possible.

2020
02:44:46,782 --> 02:44:50,023
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll see what my contacts can do.

2021
02:44:50,263 --> 02:44:50,483
[SPEAKER_19]: Ooh!

2022
02:44:50,544 --> 02:44:54,465
[SPEAKER_19]: Have your people talk to their people, and then have their people contact my people, and we'll have a people party.

2023
02:44:55,265 --> 02:44:56,005
[SPEAKER_21]: Yay, people party.

2024
02:44:56,466 --> 02:44:57,386
[SPEAKER_21]: Or do you get the Android before?

2025
02:44:58,866 --> 02:44:59,387
[SPEAKER_19]: All the time.

2026
02:44:59,707 --> 02:45:00,287
[SPEAKER_19]: Non-stop.

2027
02:45:01,027 --> 02:45:03,588
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura, I know you're a big Gem fan and a FreezePop fan.

2028
02:45:03,608 --> 02:45:04,228
[SPEAKER_19]: What did you think of that?

2029
02:45:05,189 --> 02:45:06,049
[SPEAKER_08]: That was pretty neat.

2030
02:45:06,693 --> 02:45:07,653
[SPEAKER_19]: I love the Misfits part.

2031
02:45:07,674 --> 02:45:08,514
[SPEAKER_19]: That's like the best part of this all.

2032
02:45:08,714 --> 02:45:09,654
[SPEAKER_19]: We are the Misfits.

2033
02:45:09,694 --> 02:45:10,735
[SPEAKER_19]: Our songs are better.

2034
02:45:11,475 --> 02:45:12,096
[SPEAKER_19]: Have you heard this?

2035
02:45:12,256 --> 02:45:13,456
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got a... Okay, you know what?

2036
02:45:14,577 --> 02:45:14,977
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't care.

2037
02:45:15,017 --> 02:45:17,258
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to play another little clip of a Freeze Pop song.

2038
02:45:17,298 --> 02:45:18,979
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't care that we're kind of off on a tangent right now.

2039
02:45:19,679 --> 02:45:20,199
[SPEAKER_19]: It's our show.

2040
02:45:20,240 --> 02:45:21,100
[SPEAKER_19]: We can do whatever we want.

2041
02:45:21,400 --> 02:45:25,862
[SPEAKER_19]: But you have to hear this song because they talk about video games in it.

2042
02:45:25,902 --> 02:45:27,003
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm only going to play a little clip of it.

2043
02:45:27,303 --> 02:45:31,325
[SPEAKER_19]: But you have to listen because in the beginning they sample a speak and spell.

2044
02:45:32,105 --> 02:45:33,046
[SPEAKER_19]: It is so awesome.

2045
02:45:33,286 --> 02:45:33,786
[SPEAKER_19]: Listen to this.

2046
02:45:34,086 --> 02:45:35,547
[SPEAKER_19]: And it spells out freeze poop.

2047
02:45:35,567 --> 02:45:35,807
[SPEAKER_19]: Freeze poop.

2048
02:45:36,511 --> 02:45:37,952
[SPEAKER_19]: Listen, listen, I'm not even kidding, it's awesome.

2049
02:45:41,155 --> 02:45:50,102
[SPEAKER_01]: F-R-E-E-Z-E-P-O-O-P Wrong, try again.

2050
02:45:51,082 --> 02:45:59,069
[SPEAKER_01]: F-R-E-E-Z-E-P-O-P You are correct.

2051
02:46:08,355 --> 02:46:36,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't play with me, I'm not your toy Oh, can't you see, I am not a game boy Don't mess with me, I'm not your toy Just look at me, I am not a game boy Six AA batteries, and I'm good to go 700 milliamps, I'm here to rock the show Six AA batteries, and I'm good to go

2052
02:47:00,995 --> 02:47:02,376
[SPEAKER_19]: Tell me that song is not cool.

2053
02:47:03,557 --> 02:47:04,558
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty cool.

2054
02:47:04,898 --> 02:47:06,659
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to play that song in its entirety later.

2055
02:47:06,699 --> 02:47:07,240
[SPEAKER_19]: Just you wait.

2056
02:47:08,961 --> 02:47:10,002
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, enough free spot.

2057
02:47:10,022 --> 02:47:11,663
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Illusion, for sending me all those songs.

2058
02:47:11,683 --> 02:47:12,204
[SPEAKER_19]: It's awesome.

2059
02:47:14,045 --> 02:47:14,525
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's see.

2060
02:47:15,866 --> 02:47:16,467
[SPEAKER_19]: Moving on.

2061
02:47:17,515 --> 02:47:20,137
[SPEAKER_19]: Rai Chan and Joyce are sending this question.

2062
02:47:20,657 --> 02:47:24,199
[SPEAKER_19]: Will Orange Lounge Radio ever get a studio pet?

2063
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:28,542
[SPEAKER_19]: If they make ferrets legal, you guys should get one as your studio pet.

2064
02:47:28,602 --> 02:47:31,664
[SPEAKER_21]: I was going to say, I thought the ferrets were the pets.

2065
02:47:31,724 --> 02:47:32,965
[SPEAKER_21]: I was wondering where they disappeared to.

2066
02:47:34,866 --> 02:47:36,807
[SPEAKER_19]: We haven't had the ferrets in the show in a long time.

2067
02:47:36,967 --> 02:47:39,169
[SPEAKER_19]: I think the ferrets got buried under crap.

2068
02:47:39,329 --> 02:47:40,430
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know where the ferrets are.

2069
02:47:40,490 --> 02:47:41,250
[SPEAKER_19]: They're around somewhere.

2070
02:47:41,290 --> 02:47:41,771
[SPEAKER_19]: Look around.

2071
02:47:41,791 --> 02:47:42,351
[SPEAKER_19]: They're somewhere.

2072
02:47:43,314 --> 02:47:44,655
[SPEAKER_19]: There might be some next to your chair.

2073
02:47:44,735 --> 02:47:46,036
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't you usually have them during the show?

2074
02:47:46,056 --> 02:47:48,457
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but if I bend over, my nose is going to start draining again.

2075
02:47:49,798 --> 02:47:50,899
[SPEAKER_19]: We've got the ferrets around somewhere.

2076
02:47:53,140 --> 02:48:01,145
[SPEAKER_19]: Basically, the reason why we don't have an actual pet is that... I don't know about Loki, but I am far too irresponsible to have a pet.

2077
02:48:01,245 --> 02:48:01,866
[SPEAKER_19]: I will kill it.

2078
02:48:02,226 --> 02:48:06,108
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm the type of person that will come home and say, Oh shit, I forgot to feed the cat this week.

2079
02:48:06,128 --> 02:48:07,649
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not about caring for the pet.

2080
02:48:07,729 --> 02:48:10,391
[SPEAKER_17]: It's about the $500 deposit for the pet.

2081
02:48:10,431 --> 02:48:11,292
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh yeah, that's part of it too.

2082
02:48:11,912 --> 02:48:12,613
[SPEAKER_17]: Fuck that.

2083
02:48:12,633 --> 02:48:14,093
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a lot I could do with $500.

2084
02:48:14,354 --> 02:48:16,555
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, piss it away on some computer that I won't use.

2085
02:48:16,755 --> 02:48:17,275
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.

2086
02:48:17,395 --> 02:48:20,757
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, I just don't have the desire to get a pet.

2087
02:48:21,518 --> 02:48:27,641
[SPEAKER_17]: As far as ferrets... Yep, and besides, like BRP said, they already have a studio pet.

2088
02:48:27,741 --> 02:48:28,502
[SPEAKER_17]: His name is Loki.

2089
02:48:29,982 --> 02:48:34,285
[SPEAKER_11]: And ferrets actually smell very bad, even if you... I want a penthouse pet.

2090
02:48:35,791 --> 02:48:37,573
[SPEAKER_19]: Ferrets are mean little shits, too.

2091
02:48:37,914 --> 02:48:38,515
[SPEAKER_19]: Seriously.

2092
02:48:38,535 --> 02:48:38,835
[SPEAKER_19]: No, they're not.

2093
02:48:38,995 --> 02:48:39,356
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, they are.

2094
02:48:39,396 --> 02:48:40,117
[SPEAKER_19]: Ferrets are nice.

2095
02:48:40,137 --> 02:48:40,777
[SPEAKER_19]: Ferrets are evil.

2096
02:48:40,978 --> 02:48:43,321
[SPEAKER_19]: They bite things, and they bite through your finger.

2097
02:48:43,621 --> 02:48:44,983
[SPEAKER_11]: Only if you raise them wrong.

2098
02:48:45,003 --> 02:48:49,849
[SPEAKER_19]: And at night, and after midnight, if you feed it, they turn into rabid little creatures and...

2099
02:48:50,396 --> 02:48:52,338
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you keep him around?

2100
02:48:53,459 --> 02:48:54,500
[SPEAKER_11]: Because he actually pays rent.

2101
02:48:54,520 --> 02:48:56,742
[SPEAKER_19]: But that's funny and we can tape him and put him on the internet.

2102
02:48:56,802 --> 02:48:57,582
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, and he pays rent.

2103
02:48:57,883 --> 02:49:00,024
[SPEAKER_19]: Would a ferret go out and get a job and pay rent?

2104
02:49:00,125 --> 02:49:00,765
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think so.

2105
02:49:01,486 --> 02:49:02,907
[SPEAKER_11]: My friend's ferrets were cool.

2106
02:49:03,427 --> 02:49:06,790
[SPEAKER_11]: He named them Kodo and Podo and he was going to give them to me before I moved out here.

2107
02:49:07,891 --> 02:49:09,653
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I found out that I couldn't have ferrets out here.

2108
02:49:11,371 --> 02:49:20,381
[SPEAKER_19]: Rightchan would just like to add that Joyce is saying, Joyce has a pair of really sweet ferrets, and she says, ferrets you don't because they are like a large hamster.

2109
02:49:20,401 --> 02:49:23,744
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, they're like a really small cat mixed with a hamster.

2110
02:49:25,606 --> 02:49:26,367
[SPEAKER_19]: Just what I need.

2111
02:49:27,368 --> 02:49:28,349
[SPEAKER_19]: A giant hamster.

2112
02:49:29,090 --> 02:49:31,212
[SPEAKER_19]: Think of all the gay jokes I'd hear with that one.

2113
02:49:32,213 --> 02:49:32,714
[SPEAKER_19]: What'd you sit on?

2114
02:49:32,734 --> 02:49:33,054
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.

2115
02:49:33,114 --> 02:49:33,615
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.

2116
02:49:40,785 --> 02:49:43,307
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm getting told by Joyce.

2117
02:49:43,347 --> 02:49:44,148
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't get me started.

2118
02:49:44,188 --> 02:49:45,409
[SPEAKER_19]: I know how to take care of ferrets.

2119
02:49:45,489 --> 02:49:46,890
[SPEAKER_19]: Do not underestimate ferrets.

2120
02:49:48,511 --> 02:49:51,234
[SPEAKER_19]: They're illegal in California.

2121
02:49:52,174 --> 02:49:53,495
[SPEAKER_19]: California says no to ferrets.

2122
02:49:54,156 --> 02:49:55,357
[SPEAKER_19]: They will terminate the ferrets.

2123
02:49:59,520 --> 02:50:01,261
[SPEAKER_19]: That's got to be one of the worst Arnold impressions.

2124
02:50:01,462 --> 02:50:03,163
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't get paid to impersonate Arnold.

2125
02:50:04,224 --> 02:50:08,447
[SPEAKER_17]: Did you see that stupid TV movie that they're doing

2126
02:50:09,263 --> 02:50:18,368
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you see that movie that they're doing about the governor?

2127
02:50:18,969 --> 02:50:19,849
[SPEAKER_19]: No, what about it?

2128
02:50:20,149 --> 02:50:25,132
[SPEAKER_17]: It has this old guy that doesn't look or sound like Arnold, but it's supposed to be him.

2129
02:50:25,773 --> 02:50:26,433
[SPEAKER_17]: It sucks.

2130
02:50:31,716 --> 02:50:32,336
[SPEAKER_19]: That is all.

2131
02:50:32,717 --> 02:50:34,337
[SPEAKER_19]: So that would be like me playing Arnold.

2132
02:50:35,018 --> 02:50:35,378
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2133
02:50:36,179 --> 02:50:36,759
[SPEAKER_19]: California!

2134
02:50:40,983 --> 02:50:54,771
[SPEAKER_15]: Dark Knight is sending a question.

2135
02:50:54,811 --> 02:50:58,633
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, quick question thinking about the Capcom and Namco thing.

2136
02:50:58,693 --> 02:50:59,793
[SPEAKER_19]: This was posted to our website.

2137
02:50:59,813 --> 02:51:01,834
[SPEAKER_19]: They're doing a Capcom cross Namco game.

2138
02:51:02,075 --> 02:51:04,236
[SPEAKER_19]: It's going to be like an RPG featuring both characters.

2139
02:51:04,756 --> 02:51:09,939
[SPEAKER_19]: I was wondering if Namco and Sega will finally do a Tekken versus Virtua Fighter game for real.

2140
02:51:09,959 --> 02:51:10,239
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

2141
02:51:10,427 --> 02:51:12,248
[SPEAKER_11]: God, I hope not, because I hate Virtua Fighter.

2142
02:51:13,609 --> 02:51:19,073
[SPEAKER_19]: Honestly, we are really not the people to be asking on that subject.

2143
02:51:20,514 --> 02:51:23,215
[SPEAKER_19]: Write letters, show love, maybe it'll happen, you know?

2144
02:51:23,296 --> 02:51:26,578
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want Tekken 5 to be out now.

2145
02:51:27,498 --> 02:51:28,139
[SPEAKER_19]: On console?

2146
02:51:28,479 --> 02:51:28,739
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2147
02:51:28,779 --> 02:51:29,880
[SPEAKER_19]: That'd be pretty hot.

2148
02:51:30,800 --> 02:51:33,482
[SPEAKER_11]: Dan's saving a Tekken 5 poster for me to go in my cubicle.

2149
02:51:36,024 --> 02:51:36,844
[SPEAKER_19]: When is that supposed to come out?

2150
02:51:36,884 --> 02:51:37,485
[SPEAKER_19]: Do we have a release?

2151
02:51:38,405 --> 02:51:38,806
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

2152
02:51:38,966 --> 02:51:39,086
[SPEAKER_11]: Hmm.

2153
02:51:40,206 --> 02:51:42,707
[SPEAKER_19]: I honestly don't know.

2154
02:51:42,987 --> 02:51:43,627
[SPEAKER_19]: That would be neat.

2155
02:51:43,787 --> 02:51:45,908
[SPEAKER_19]: Crossover games can be neat, but we don't know.

2156
02:51:46,748 --> 02:51:48,288
[SPEAKER_19]: Here's a question maybe we can help with.

2157
02:51:49,889 --> 02:51:50,449
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's see.

2158
02:51:51,029 --> 02:51:53,350
[SPEAKER_19]: Dark Knight says, another question I need your help on.

2159
02:51:53,410 --> 02:51:57,651
[SPEAKER_19]: Choosing an anime character to dress up as when I go to a local convention in June.

2160
02:51:58,311 --> 02:52:03,772
[SPEAKER_19]: Should I dress up as a character from B-Blade or Lan from Mega... You will so be laughed at.

2161
02:52:04,053 --> 02:52:06,273
[SPEAKER_19]: Or Lan from Mega Man and T-Series?

2162
02:52:08,414 --> 02:52:09,314
[SPEAKER_11]: Go with the second one.

2163
02:52:11,252 --> 02:52:13,013
[SPEAKER_19]: I think you should dress up as a milkmaid.

2164
02:52:14,934 --> 02:52:15,695
[SPEAKER_21]: Super Milk John?

2165
02:52:16,335 --> 02:52:16,615
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2166
02:52:18,756 --> 02:52:21,598
[SPEAKER_19]: Go as Ranma, because it's one of the only animes I've actually seen.

2167
02:52:23,219 --> 02:52:23,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

2168
02:52:24,800 --> 02:52:28,462
[SPEAKER_11]: Ranma cosplay should have been buried five years ago.

2169
02:52:29,743 --> 02:52:30,804
[SPEAKER_21]: What about Sailor Menchi?

2170
02:52:35,006 --> 02:52:36,567
[SPEAKER_21]: That really killed everyone right there.

2171
02:52:37,267 --> 02:52:38,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, the last...

2172
02:52:38,937 --> 02:52:44,521
[SPEAKER_11]: AX I went to, though, had an Utena cosplayer who went as Utena in the boy's uniform.

2173
02:52:46,503 --> 02:52:49,846
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was a guy cosplaying her who looked very female.

2174
02:52:52,087 --> 02:52:54,309
[SPEAKER_11]: But it was really good cosplay.

2175
02:52:54,349 --> 02:52:57,432
[SPEAKER_11]: And then he went around later in the girl's style with the shorts and everything.

2176
02:52:58,913 --> 02:53:02,295
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there was the Umi cosplayer who was a guy at Faname 2001.

2177
02:53:07,319 --> 02:53:08,160
[SPEAKER_21]: What's it the mob asked?

2178
02:53:12,789 --> 02:53:14,269
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even know how to pronounce that.

2179
02:53:14,549 --> 02:53:15,389
[SPEAKER_21]: It's Dumabass.

2180
02:53:16,529 --> 02:53:17,629
[SPEAKER_21]: No, it's Dumas.

2181
02:53:18,870 --> 02:53:19,690
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Dumas.

2182
02:53:20,150 --> 02:53:22,930
[SPEAKER_19]: I love it when people make typos and everybody jumps on them.

2183
02:53:23,310 --> 02:53:24,711
[SPEAKER_19]: Ha ha, you said Dumabass.

2184
02:53:25,771 --> 02:53:27,491
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's start internet trend now.

2185
02:53:27,891 --> 02:53:31,892
[SPEAKER_17]: Whenever you say dumbass or type dumbass, always spell it like that.

2186
02:53:32,152 --> 02:53:32,772
[SPEAKER_17]: Dumubass.

2187
02:53:34,952 --> 02:53:35,792
[SPEAKER_17]: Just like pwned.

2188
02:53:36,373 --> 02:53:37,273
[SPEAKER_17]: You heard it here first.

2189
02:53:37,333 --> 02:53:37,933
[SPEAKER_17]: Dumubass.

2190
02:53:38,133 --> 02:53:38,773
[SPEAKER_17]: Dumubass.

2191
02:53:42,856 --> 02:53:43,857
[SPEAKER_19]: Shut up, you demubass.

2192
02:53:45,418 --> 02:53:46,800
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, let's see.

2193
02:53:47,040 --> 02:53:50,523
[SPEAKER_21]: Smells like demubass.

2194
02:53:50,583 --> 02:53:53,146
[SPEAKER_19]: Joyce wanted to clarify a few things about the pet ferret.

2195
02:53:54,287 --> 02:53:54,827
[SPEAKER_19]: They're tasty.

2196
02:53:54,927 --> 02:53:58,811
[SPEAKER_19]: She's getting... That is not what she's saying.

2197
02:53:58,991 --> 02:53:59,472
[SPEAKER_19]: You sure?

2198
02:54:00,072 --> 02:54:00,753
[SPEAKER_19]: As I'm sure.

2199
02:54:01,906 --> 02:54:08,747
[SPEAKER_19]: It became illegal because of wrong scientific information in the 1930s that they are wild animals and non-domesticated.

2200
02:54:09,188 --> 02:54:13,108
[SPEAKER_19]: They've been domesticated for so long that they couldn't survive in the wild.

2201
02:54:13,508 --> 02:54:16,849
[SPEAKER_19]: The AFA is working on getting them legalized in California.

2202
02:54:18,269 --> 02:54:19,830
[SPEAKER_19]: But in the meantime, you know what?

2203
02:54:20,070 --> 02:54:23,010
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't want to go to jail over a ferret.

2204
02:54:23,391 --> 02:54:24,871
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't want to be sitting next to Bubba.

2205
02:54:24,891 --> 02:54:27,431
[SPEAKER_11]: They're just going to slap a fine on you.

2206
02:54:27,671 --> 02:54:28,692
[SPEAKER_11]: What are you in here for?

2207
02:54:29,612 --> 02:54:30,332
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, I asked Bubba.

2208
02:54:30,891 --> 02:54:32,352
[SPEAKER_19]: Bubba, what are you in here for?

2209
02:54:33,473 --> 02:54:35,414
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm in here for committing murder.

2210
02:54:35,815 --> 02:54:37,596
[SPEAKER_27]: I murdered a guy over drugs.

2211
02:54:38,317 --> 02:54:40,118
[SPEAKER_27]: What are you in here for, gay boy?

2212
02:54:40,898 --> 02:54:41,659
[SPEAKER_19]: I owned a ferret.

2213
02:54:41,679 --> 02:54:46,342
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, you're not going to go to jail for owning a ferret, but that would be funny.

2214
02:54:46,583 --> 02:54:47,884
[SPEAKER_19]: That would be a great sitcom.

2215
02:54:49,144 --> 02:54:49,985
[SPEAKER_11]: Another big guy.

2216
02:54:50,706 --> 02:54:53,107
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm in here for ripping the tag off a pillow.

2217
02:54:55,249 --> 02:54:57,831
[SPEAKER_20]: It's another episode of Bubba and the Gay!

2218
02:55:03,143 --> 02:55:05,164
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh my god, this ferret was tearing apart my curtains.

2219
02:55:05,284 --> 02:55:05,964
[SPEAKER_19]: I was so mad.

2220
02:55:07,545 --> 02:55:13,027
[SPEAKER_11]: I just had an image of a little Korean lady in the background going, Are you the gay?

2221
02:55:14,228 --> 02:55:15,168
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you the gay?

2222
02:55:15,188 --> 02:55:17,269
[SPEAKER_19]: The Korean lady can be like the warden.

2223
02:55:20,170 --> 02:55:24,872
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it would be very funny to put gay man and bubba in the same cell.

2224
02:55:24,932 --> 02:55:25,712
[SPEAKER_19]: What is that accent?

2225
02:55:25,732 --> 02:55:26,633
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't even know what I'm doing.

2226
02:55:27,133 --> 02:55:27,553
[SPEAKER_19]: Forget it.

2227
02:55:28,414 --> 02:55:29,254
[SPEAKER_21]: Korean-Italian?

2228
02:55:32,717 --> 02:55:34,017
[SPEAKER_21]: Really Spicy Spaghetti, I guess?

2229
02:55:34,238 --> 02:55:35,318
[SPEAKER_19]: You got a purty mouth.

2230
02:55:35,358 --> 02:55:39,139
[SPEAKER_19]: My ferret had a purty mouth.

2231
02:55:39,159 --> 02:55:40,380
[SPEAKER_21]: Because we're demubasses.

2232
02:55:59,042 --> 02:56:00,203
[SPEAKER_19]: You need to come here more often.

2233
02:56:00,343 --> 02:56:01,144
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, yes, I know.

2234
02:56:01,384 --> 02:56:03,166
[SPEAKER_19]: So people... Now, let me finish the question.

2235
02:56:03,526 --> 02:56:07,850
[SPEAKER_19]: Why doesn't someone change the webcam so people don't look at the couch the whole time?

2236
02:56:08,431 --> 02:56:10,293
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it's not going to be pointed at me.

2237
02:56:11,474 --> 02:56:12,335
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, we have a ban.

2238
02:56:12,435 --> 02:56:15,538
[SPEAKER_19]: Jamie is banning herself from the camera.

2239
02:56:15,758 --> 02:56:17,740
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll get on the fucking cam.

2240
02:56:18,220 --> 02:56:20,082
[SPEAKER_19]: Jamie's going to go supermodel on the cam.

2241
02:56:20,342 --> 02:56:21,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, fuck a cam.

2242
02:56:21,363 --> 02:56:21,584
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

2243
02:56:26,044 --> 02:56:29,907
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, Jamie's inching her way towards the cam so that you can see something new.

2244
02:56:30,668 --> 02:56:32,949
[SPEAKER_19]: Basically, what are you doing?

2245
02:56:34,671 --> 02:56:35,811
[SPEAKER_19]: Jamie's made her way to the cam.

2246
02:56:35,832 --> 02:56:37,273
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, Jamie is on the cam right now.

2247
02:56:37,313 --> 02:56:40,655
[SPEAKER_19]: A little piece of Jamie for you guys on the cam.

2248
02:56:43,758 --> 02:56:51,804
[SPEAKER_19]: Basically, the way the cam is set up, it's actually inside that massive arcade cabinet that Loki has set up.

2249
02:56:51,924 --> 02:56:54,726
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's a real bitch to take the eye toy out of it.

2250
02:56:55,399 --> 02:56:56,560
[SPEAKER_19]: and put it somewhere else.

2251
02:56:57,841 --> 02:56:59,722
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, there have been previous episodes.

2252
02:56:59,762 --> 02:57:03,505
[SPEAKER_19]: There was an episode not that long ago where we actually had the iToyCam pointed over this way.

2253
02:57:03,525 --> 02:57:11,311
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, it's not really that much of a bitch to take... Yes, it's a huge bitch to take out of the cabinet.

2254
02:57:12,292 --> 02:57:16,975
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh my god, the... Yeah, exactly what... Yes.

2255
02:57:18,416 --> 02:57:19,277
[SPEAKER_17]: Pain in the dumb ass.

2256
02:57:20,954 --> 02:57:22,356
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to make this catch on.

2257
02:57:22,656 --> 02:57:23,296
[SPEAKER_17]: You're going to like it.

2258
02:57:23,316 --> 02:57:24,357
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just like Death Cake.

2259
02:57:24,858 --> 02:57:27,861
[SPEAKER_19]: The chat room has a request for you to do your grudge face on cam.

2260
02:57:31,344 --> 02:57:31,985
[SPEAKER_19]: She's going to do it.

2261
02:57:32,045 --> 02:57:33,346
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have a grudge face.

2262
02:57:33,887 --> 02:57:35,088
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just me with my mouth open.

2263
02:57:39,092 --> 02:57:39,632
[SPEAKER_19]: Think fish.

2264
02:57:42,916 --> 02:57:43,156
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

2265
02:57:43,436 --> 02:57:44,117
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, illusion.

2266
02:57:44,137 --> 02:57:44,317
[SPEAKER_19]: Illusion.

2267
02:57:45,476 --> 02:57:46,197
[SPEAKER_19]: as a question.

2268
02:57:46,817 --> 02:57:50,260
[SPEAKER_19]: Since you've got 10 minutes of no questions, I suppose I'll ask another.

2269
02:57:50,320 --> 02:57:53,642
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, what's your favorite freeze pop song?

2270
02:57:54,563 --> 02:57:56,744
[SPEAKER_19]: Obviously, I'm having an orgasm over them recently.

2271
02:57:59,306 --> 02:58:00,467
[SPEAKER_19]: Science Genius Girl remix.

2272
02:58:01,428 --> 02:58:01,948
[SPEAKER_19]: The live one.

2273
02:58:03,069 --> 02:58:05,291
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, you know what Science Genius Girl remix rocks?

2274
02:58:08,073 --> 02:58:08,393
None of them.

2275
02:58:09,134 --> 02:58:11,495
[SPEAKER_19]: No, Loki, none of them is not the correct answer.

2276
02:58:11,515 --> 02:58:13,697
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to kick you in the dumb ass now.

2277
02:58:14,184 --> 02:58:14,525
[SPEAKER_19]: I know.

2278
02:58:15,688 --> 02:58:16,811
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't be such a demub-ass.

2279
02:58:18,595 --> 02:58:21,883
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the Science Genius Girl mix that sounds like it was done on a Game Boy.

2280
02:58:21,963 --> 02:58:22,404
[SPEAKER_19]: Listen to this.

2281
02:58:22,424 --> 02:58:22,966
[SPEAKER_19]: It's so cool.

2282
02:58:50,785 --> 02:58:59,230
[SPEAKER_15]: Fun times two times three When I clone a human being Isn't that cool?

2283
02:58:59,270 --> 02:58:59,750
[SPEAKER_11]: I want that.

2284
02:58:59,770 --> 02:59:00,310
[SPEAKER_11]: Send that to me.

2285
02:59:00,370 --> 02:59:01,071
[SPEAKER_19]: Isn't that cool?

2286
02:59:02,391 --> 02:59:04,753
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we might use that in a show intro, like, later on.

2287
02:59:05,153 --> 02:59:06,073
[SPEAKER_19]: That would so rock.

2288
02:59:08,815 --> 02:59:09,915
[SPEAKER_19]: Pardon me, Bison coming through.

2289
02:59:11,456 --> 02:59:14,478
[SPEAKER_19]: Dark Knight's pissed because we're making fun of his demubass comment.

2290
02:59:14,738 --> 02:59:17,640
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, he's such a demubass, we're not even being able to spell demubass correctly.

2291
02:59:18,100 --> 02:59:19,260
[SPEAKER_19]: Aw, but we love him.

2292
02:59:19,541 --> 02:59:20,241
[SPEAKER_19]: It's alright.

2293
02:59:22,601 --> 02:59:23,001
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

2294
02:59:23,702 --> 02:59:24,382
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh boy, oh boy.

2295
02:59:28,805 --> 02:59:30,146
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, think about it this way, Dark Knight.

2296
02:59:30,186 --> 02:59:34,269
[SPEAKER_19]: You are on the cutting edge of a new internet trend.

2297
02:59:41,193 --> 02:59:49,299
[SPEAKER_19]: My favorite freeze pop song for the record would be the... Oh God, I forgot the name of it.

2298
02:59:50,259 --> 02:59:51,140
[SPEAKER_19]: What a fan I am.

2299
02:59:52,645 --> 02:59:54,967
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we're about wrapping up the show.

2300
02:59:54,987 --> 02:59:58,789
[SPEAKER_19]: We're pretty much done, boys and girls.

2301
02:59:58,809 --> 03:00:01,731
[SPEAKER_19]: But we have to get everybody's final thought before this show can be over.

2302
03:00:01,751 --> 03:00:02,431
[SPEAKER_19]: Bug, your final thought.

2303
03:00:25,473 --> 03:00:26,273
[SPEAKER_19]: Angel, your final thought?

2304
03:00:28,075 --> 03:00:29,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Online games are addicting.

[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura?

2306
03:00:40,186 --> 03:00:41,348
[SPEAKER_19]: Loki, your final thought?

2307
03:00:43,049 --> 03:00:47,013
[SPEAKER_17]: My final thought is I made a mess and didn't do anything and

2308
03:00:48,430 --> 03:00:49,431
[SPEAKER_17]: Now I'm back to square one.

2309
03:00:49,451 --> 03:00:50,792
[SPEAKER_19]: You made a mess, now clean it up.

2310
03:00:51,152 --> 03:00:52,593
[SPEAKER_17]: I did clean it up, that's what I'm doing right now.

2311
03:00:53,054 --> 03:00:56,957
[SPEAKER_17]: But, uh... I hate this stupid thing.

2312
03:00:57,177 --> 03:00:57,658
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what?

2313
03:00:57,858 --> 03:01:02,382
[SPEAKER_17]: I could have bought a laptop for the money and built this damn thing and it would have been more powerful, too.

2314
03:01:02,642 --> 03:01:03,102
[SPEAKER_19]: Probably.

2315
03:01:03,543 --> 03:01:04,043
[SPEAKER_17]: Go figure.

2316
03:01:04,063 --> 03:01:05,184
[SPEAKER_19]: But not as leet.

2317
03:01:05,944 --> 03:01:06,885
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess, whatever.

2318
03:01:07,085 --> 03:01:07,366
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

2319
03:01:08,467 --> 03:01:09,327

[SPEAKER_19]: Um... And then, um...

2321
03:01:15,928 --> 03:01:20,170
[SPEAKER_19]: My final thought would be 1-800-96-JERRY.

2322

2326
03:01:26,873 --> 03:01:28,354
[SPEAKER_19]: One word to sum it all up.

[SPEAKER_19]: I just found a bootleg site.

2338
03:03:16,936 --> 03:03:20,098
[SPEAKER_19]: Somebody's posting episodes of this show up on a bootleg page.

2339
03:03:20,719 --> 03:03:21,379
[SPEAKER_19]: We should sue them.

2340
03:03:21,799 --> 03:03:22,540
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to sue.

2341
03:03:23,180 --> 03:03:23,661
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I'm just kidding.

03:03:23,681 --> 03:03:24,281

2343
03:03:25,162 --> 03:03:25,762
[SPEAKER_19]: That's kind of cool.

2344
03:03:26,102 --> 03:03:27,223
[SPEAKER_19]: Orange House Radio is being bootlegged.

2345
03:03:27,243 --> 03:03:27,844
[SPEAKER_19]: That's so cool.

2346
03:03:29,505 --> 03:03:30,806
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't do it.

2347
03:03:31,386 --> 03:03:32,207
[SPEAKER_10]: I am innocent.

2348
03:03:32,327 --> 03:03:32,707
