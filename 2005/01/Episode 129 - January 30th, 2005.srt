00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000

You're tuned in to the B-Money Scene's most repaired radio station of all things, B-Money.

51
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,620
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

52
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:54,620
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts, in this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm,

53
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,620
Miss Jamie Summers, AKA, DarkSakura.

54
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,620
I hate my nose. I hate allergies.

55
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,120
Oh, are you allergic to me?

56
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,620
I've been like this all day.

57
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,620
Oh, I'm sorry. What is it that you're allergic to?

58
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,620
Everything.

59
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,620
Oh, I'm sorry. It's not gay people, is it?

60
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,620
Yes, Rob, it's gay people. I'm sorry.

61
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:21,620
Also joining us, say hello to Tech Massa, Loki!

62
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,620
I found my knife.

63
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,620
Please, don't run around the house with it.

64
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,620
Promise me you will not chase DDR Angel around with your knife again this week.

65
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:35,620
Okay, I'll have to see about that, but sure.

66
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,620
Speaking of DDR Angels, say hello to our special guest.

67
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,620
Hello.

68
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,620
You're always here.

69
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,620
Yeah, now what are you going to call me? Uh-oh.

70
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:51,620
I'm going to call you Al. I don't know, I just was thinking of the old...

71
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,620
forget it. Anyway, um, that's it.

72
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,620
Angel's the only special guest here tonight. She's not really that special anymore either, because she's

73
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,620
always here, so she's just, she's just, you know, your standard guest. She's more of a standard guest

74
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,620
than a special guest. I'm just your pest.

75
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,620
No, no, no, you wouldn't be a pest, because then when I sprayed

76
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,620
the raid on you, it would have gotten rid of you.

77
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,620
Raid?

78
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,620
Ah!

79
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,620
I'm just kidding.

80
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,620
Alright.

81
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,140
Um, but it's just us, you know, feeling the love here in the Orange Launch Radio Studio,

82
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,780
especially after a chaotic week last week.

83
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,740
I wish I felt the love from my allergy medicine.

84
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,060
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

85
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,300
Well, this should be a lovely night.

86
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,740
Jamie's extra sassy because of her allergies.

87
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,300
Loki's got a knife.

88
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,500
This should be an interesting show.

89
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:48,400
I'm just trying to turn this into a round cable, but I think I just broke it.

90
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,020
So basically you've got a square cable over there and you're trying to turn it into a

91
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,020
round cable.

92
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,020
It's a ribbon cable.

93
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:59,420
I thought, at least in theory, that I could split these down here, however they're a little

94
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:04,180
thinner than I thought, so when I poked this knife through, instead of actually splitting

95
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,740
it, it stripped all the covering on this one wire here.

96
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,740
I don't fucking care.

97
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,740
Tonight is definitely one of those nights.

98
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,740
I want the world to die.

99
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:53,740
Everything and everything in this world needs to wither and die and stop spreading your goddamn pollen.

100
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,740
Please!

101
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,740
And the person in the chatroom named come as you are.

102
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,740
No script. Bad.

103
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,740
Go ahead and boot their ass.

104
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,740
What the hell?

105
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,740
That calls for insta-ban.

106
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:42,740
let that die already. No! Alright, we'll be back after this with more Orange Launch Radio,

107
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,740
maybe some Bamani news, some random video game stuff. Jamie wants to take this show

108
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,740
tonight in a really random video game direction, but I don't care, we're going to do it. So

109
00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:01,740
So stay tuned, we'll be back after this with Don't Stop!

110
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,740
But you know our love will always stay the same

111
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,740
Don't ever stop

112
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,740
Don't ever quit

113
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,740
Don't ever take it up

114
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,740
You're my man

115
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,740
Yes, it's our friend

116
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,740
You are my friend

117
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,740
You are the best thing that ever happened to me

118
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,740
No one could ever come between

119
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,740
You and me, baby

120
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:57,740
Because we are what friends should be

121
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:05,740
I guess you should go, I'll pick you up, oh sweet baby

122
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:14,740
As years go by, you'll always have me

123
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:22,740
Don't ever stop, don't ever quit Don't ever take your love from me

124
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:29,740
Yes it's my win, you are my friend You are the best thing ever happened to me

125
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:37,740
Don't ever stop, don't ever quit Don't ever take your love from me

126
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:44,740
Don't ever stop, don't ever quit, don't ever take your love from me

127
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,740
Is

128

How do I look?

142
00:16:51,380 --> 00:17:11,820
I love that promo because it's the only one we have where I get to hear Jamie click like

143
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:15,860
a chicken.

144
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,100
I can't do any imitations right now.

145
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,100
Aww.

146
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,100
It says one.

147
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,100

148
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,600

Especially when the sequel comes out. They know. They have the right to do it again.

152
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
They are making a sequel right, they have to do it again.

153
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,600
I've already been out in Japan.

154
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,560
Yeah, they're working on a sequel.

155
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,600
They did a TV series too.

156
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,600
Really? What was the TV series called?

00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,100

Hope you guys had a lovely week.

170

173

00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,840
was trying to go to a concert tonight I wanted to go see Scissor Sisters tonight

177
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,840
because they're playing in San Francisco and I know a lot of you guys probably

178
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,360
don't even know who this band is although they did play on Saturday Night

179
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:55,360
I love watching when it became unfunny back in the 90s.

180
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,640
back row like it was row like double y in the second balcony okay it was that far back

181
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,120
and I was like fuck that I'm not gonna get tickets if I have to sit that far back so

182
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,440
I'm gonna wait because usually with concerts this is a trick a lot of people don't know

183
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,440
they'll open up better tickets like a week before or you know sometimes you can get general

184
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,800
admission so we were trying to get floor seats but it never opened up I kept checking every

185
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:43,720
day and I was not able to get better tickets so therefore I'm here tonight where somewhere

186
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,800
in the city by the bay

187
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,440
scissors sisters taking the stage right now and i'm not there

188
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,320
therefore i'm a little bit better tonight

189
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,080
the sound a little bit better

190
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,360
because i could be somewhere else

191
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,980
we're gonna stop tonight show

192
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,640

i made it to level ten in a week

196
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:17,420
Fucking game. Also known as Final Fantasy XI.

197
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:22,180
Yeah. Been going to school. My teacher's an asshole.

198
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:26,060
More like an elitist snob, but eh.

199
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:29,900
Just stuff, really.

200
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,900
I went bowling yesterday

201
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:39,220
with Iguana Girl and Islander. You went bowling? I went bowling. I scored five strikes my second game.

202
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,660
Nice.

203
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:44,260
Do you do the strike dance? Strike!

204
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,140
Did you do that?

205
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,660
Um, then we went to Mikuni.

206
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,140
Oh my god, Jamie.

207
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:54,180
We should start an orange lounge bowling league.

208
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,140
Um, no.

209
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,760
No.

210
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,300
Come on!

211
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,660
We could all have orange bowling balls.

212
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:07,660
Come on. It'd be cute. And we could all have this... Rob. Rob. Rob. Rob.

213
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,160
Rob.

214
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,660
What?

215
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,160
Uhh...

216
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,660
What?

217
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,160
No.

218
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,160
Sorry to interrupt.

219
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,160
Hey, Rob, once I had a really good idea just like that...

220
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,660
Uh-huh.

221
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:20,660
You know, it was to put a Russian space station around, you know, orbit.

222
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,160
Mm-hmm.

223
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,160
Around Earth.

224
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,660
Yeah, that didn't turn out very well.

225
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,660
Why don't you let me finish your week?

226
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,660
Uhh...

227
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,160
I've been sneezing all day.

228
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,160
Woke up with a cat on my head.

229
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,660
Umm...

230
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:38,660
I just... I'm done.

231
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:42,660
It's not very often that Jamie wakes up with pussy in her face.

232
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:46,660
You know what? That wasn't funny.

233
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:50,660
I thought it was funny and I didn't even hear the... I was laughing before the joke.

234
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:54,660
The reaction we got in studio when I said that, just Jamie

235
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:58,660
she's got this very dead look on her face, like you know kind of like

236
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:02,660
you know she's got that look on her face right now, she's kind of leaning back, she's staring off

237
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:06,800
into space staring at the ceiling going you know I don't want to be here type

238
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,820
thing and then when I said that you know and she doesn't often get pussy on her

239
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:18,640
face she just kind of reaches over and grabs the mic and goes you know what no

240
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:24,740
my cat didn't poop that's sick sometimes I wish we were a TV show I really do I

241
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:35,420
I've taken two doses of Advil cold sinus, a dose of Benadryl, and two doses of Tylenol

242
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,780
allergy sinus.

243
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:45,620
I'm drugged, upset, I ate three lindered chocolate balls on the way here.

244
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,940
Were they salty chocolate balls?

245
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,780
Oh hush, they were dark chocolate.

246
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:56,840
And then I go look at my friends list to see freakin' sluts on my friends list on my live

247
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,840
journal.

248
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,840
Guys-

249
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,680
I got sluts on my friends list too, but that's just how they-

250
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,680
But I need pictures of sluts!

251
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,680
Oh, I'm like, these are actual people, I just have to accept them, that's the way they are.

252
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,880
I never get sluts on my friends list.

253
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,560
Oh, my life is miserable.

254
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,440
Join a couple gay live journal communities, you can get tons of sluts on your friends

255
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,440
page.

256
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,440
No. I mean...

257
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,440
That is...

258
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,440
Wow. Wow.

259
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,440
Uh, Loki, how was your week? How was your day?

260
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,440
Um, well, my week was okay.

261
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,440
Didn't really do too much.

262
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:52,440
See, Friday Christopher brought over the parts for his PC, so I built that, and that was fun, until I couldn't figure out why I wasn't booting.

263
00:23:52,440 --> 00:24:04,440
Because, now, the motherboard I bought has actually two different chipsets on it, you know, so you can run the older, um, Athlon processors, and you can run the new 64-bit ones.

264
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,440
The ones beside, you know, above, uh, 3.2 gigahertz or whatever.

265
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:19,440
So, anyways, I had the processor in the right one, but I had the RAM in the wrong set of slots there, so it wasn't booting up.

266
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:27,440
Finally figured that out after about six hours, and then loaded that all up. It looks really cool.

267
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:35,440
Christopher's computer is very purdy. It glows purple and, like, black light, purple and pink. It's very nice.

268
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:41,980
I think Christopher put it best actually, he said his computer looks like Metroid Prime.

269
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:46,500
And then, on my computer, which is sitting in the middle of the room right now, I installed

270
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:51,800
the motherboard in that and cut the rest of the case. So I'm pretty much ready to go with

271
00:24:51,800 --> 00:25:02,220
that. I probably should set it up to install everything. So I was messing around with that.

272
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:07,220
And then play lots of Final Fantasy. And...

273
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:16,220
We didn't do too much else other than that. Oh, I've been, well, like, the first night when Christopher brought his computer over at Friday, I stayed up till six in the morning.

274
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:24,220
And then, last night, I stayed up till six in the morning playing Final Fantasy. So, I'm kinda like my, um...

275
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:30,220
Whole, like, schedule's messed up right now. It's been staying up way too late.

276
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:35,020
and you have to work tomorrow huh yeah sucks to be you gonna be great though

277
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:40,860
because my co-workers quitting so now they're gonna be panicking it's great

278
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:45,980
because I am in like I'm just an observer and they're panic so be fun

279
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:52,420
then this week I have to go see the Kings in floor seats I hate the Kings

280
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:57,900
but I'm taking my mom because whatever I couldn't really do much of these tickets

281
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:06,660
So, okay, DT says I should invest in a Mac Mini. No, I'm sorry, I already have a toaster.

282
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,020
I don't need a piece of shit computer that's small.

283
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:14,340
Why do you hate Apple computers so much? I mean, I remember the day I brought home my

284
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,340
iPod, you were like...

285
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:23,220
Okay, I'll tell you why. Back in the day when I had to do fucking school assignments at

286
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:27,260
the Mac Lab at our school, okay, I'll tell you what, those things are a piece of shit.

287
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:32,340
you put the disc in, the whole thing explodes. That is pretty much how reliable Macintosh

288
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,840
computers are. They're computers for idiots!

289
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:39,880
But I remember in the computer school lab, the Macs, when you turn them on, you'd see

290
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,300
the little picture of the computer, and it had the little happy face.

291
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:46,760
You don't buy computers because they're cute! You buy them because they work, and they're

292
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:52,640
functionable! You don't buy fucking cute computers! You shouldn't choose a computer because, oh,

293
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,120
it'll match my curtains! Fuck that!

294
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:01,240
okay but it'll still get on the internet and the fact that it matches the

295
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:01,880
curtains

296
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,760
yeah you know an old 386 computer will get on the internet too but you know what I'm not

297
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,800
going to be using that

298
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,920
they're good if you're a graphic artist

299
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,980
aha good graphic and actually you can

300
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:18,320
link for every Mac you have linked up

301
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,500
it will increase the entire processing power of the entire unit because the

302
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,640
dual processing system

303
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,880
You can actually get more power out of a Mac than you can out of a PC.

304
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,960
You can do that with anything.

305
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,320
And they do the video-editing really easy.

306
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,080
Really easy.

307
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,800
You can do that with anything.

308
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,840
You can film the kitty.

309
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,000
You can film your kitty-cat.

310
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,640
Ooh.

311
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,320
And then really easily put it on your Mac.

312
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,140
And you can make little videos, like,

313
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:40,720
My kitty.

314
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,820
And, you know, string it all together, and then you put, like,

315
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,100
music in the background.

316
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,940
So cute and so easy on a Mac.

317
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,860
You can do that with Windows, too.

318
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,480
Yeah, but everything crashes in Windows.

319
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,040
No, not everything crashes in Windows.

320
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,620
Everything crashes in Windows.

321
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,460
It's more like a fucking Mac.

322
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,460
Now, don't get... Hey, you know what? Don't get me wrong. I love Windows.

323
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,460
You want to hear about Macs? They're powerful gaming machines. Look at all those fucking games for the Macs.

324
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:04,460
Oh, wait! No, there isn't! That's right, because they suck!

325
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,460
Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Okay.

326
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:12,460
I'll tell you what's cool about Macs are the laptops, the little iBooks.

327
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:16,460
The little apple, when you use it on the back, it glows.

328
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:21,460
So, let's say you ever have to be in the dark.

329
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:30,820
the Apple will glow and it gives shut up stop but it's not you have you ever

330
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:34,580
been to the Apple Store at the mall they actually have here here blinding here at

331
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:38,420
the local mall yeah they have an Apple Store and I don't know how they light

332
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:42,860
that thing I think they actually took a little chunk of the Sun and put it inside

333
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:50,220
the Apple Store because it is so freaking bright in there yeah it's like

334
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:57,280
you know no no I'm sorry I am I will never ever ever I'm going down the

335
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:03,520
record stance I will never own anything that's made by Apple nothing I'm not

336
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,760
buying an iPod I'm not buying a computer I will not buy a laptop made by them

337
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:13,640
nothing of course Apple is a fully in subsidiary of Microsoft you know what

338
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:22,800
did I say Microsoft I said Apple hey you know what you should hold your tongue

339
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:34,480
and say Apple it's really funny yeah Apple you know elementary school a while

340
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:42,320
ago this is coming from someone who said that the chair was not green the chair's

341
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,320
The chair's green. I think the chair's green.

342
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,320
It's mostly black, okay?

343
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,320
It's green!

344
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:52,320
If you take green, or black, and add a little bit of green to that, okay? That is mainly black.

345
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,320
It's a night green.

346
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,320
You know what? It's black, okay?

347
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,320
I will take a piece of that chair into a paint match store and we will settle this debate.

348
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,320
It's fucking black. Just like my trench coat. My trench coat's blue, but it's fucking black.

349
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:13,820
It looks black, therefore it's black, okay? I don't care if it has a hint of green in it. It's still black.

350
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,820
Hold on, hold on a minute.

351
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,820
That actually is more green.

352
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,820
Hold on a minute.

353
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,320
Whatever.

354
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:25,820
Hold on, hold on, I'm working. No wait, I want you to rant a little more here. I'm just, you know, finding some music here.

355
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,820
The chair is green.

356
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,320
Black.

357
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,320
Green.

358
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:36,820
Black.

359
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:44,020
green black it's a goddamn chair if Justin Timberlake can be black that

360
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:53,580
chair can be black okay are you finished yes angel how was your week how was your

361
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:58,500
day Rob made my tongue numb ah I don't even

362
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,660
want to know how that happened sorry I won't bite so hard next time what are

363
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:12,380
you talking about? Stupid Altoids. AHHH! And that was your week and your day? No. Um, jeez,

364
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:18,580
smilefancy11, eh. Um, unfortunately when I was on you guys weren't, because you guys

365
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:25,700
had to work, so, but then again I had school, so, eh. Not much happened, and I'm supposed

366
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:30,780
to say hi to Mikey. So, hi Mikey! Otherwise known as BRP Ohio Baloney.

367
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:38,520
That's quick. My week and my day, uh, really not a whole lot going on. I did play a little

368
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,960
bit of Final Fantasy. I had days off actually this week. I took Monday and Tuesday off of

369
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,840
work and oh my god, I had this big list of things I was gonna do. I was gonna go to the

370
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,000
mall and I was gonna go shopping and I was gonna, like there was all this stuff I wanted

371
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,720
to buy, like new socks and underwear and things. I was gonna buy all this stuff at the mall

372
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:59,720
And then, let's see, I was gonna go to Ikea one day, and then I was gonna clean my room

373
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,720
from top to bottom.

374
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,600
I had this big project where I was gonna, like, totally redo my room and clean it, and

375
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:14,080
I didn't get any of that done because I was leveling in Final Fantasy all day both days.

376
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:20,240
I think I'm just gonna uninstall it, and I won't be tempted to play it anymore.

377
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,240
I'm seriously wondering how much would I get done if Final Fantasy XI wasn't installing it.

378
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,240
You know what though, seriously, if it wasn't that, it would be some other game.

379
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,240
I'd go right back to playing Final Fantasy X, or something.

380
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,240
Look, he says, at least I'd finished the damn game.

381
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,240
Alright, whatever.

382
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,240
And now they're yelling at me, I can't uninstall the game.

383
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,240
Let's see, what else? What else is going on in Rob's World?

384
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:51,760
yesterday we went out to sushi that was cool we went to wasabi which is cool

385
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,760
because when you actually when you walk in the door they all yell at you from

386
00:32:54,760 --> 00:33:04,680
behind the bar when you walk in and it always scares me it always scares me

387
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,880
when I walk in there it's like you know I walk in doo doo doo doo I'm gonna walk

388
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:15,360
into a nice little sushi restaurant I don't know it always sounds like wasabi

389
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,200
I always thought they were saying the name of the restaurant.

390
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,080
Oh, cause I know, well, Makuni does it, so like, any time you go into

391
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,660
an establishment, they're supposed to go to Ashima Se, which is like, welcome.

392
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:30,760
Oh. Very polite one. But see, we'll see the thing about, like, Makuni and other sushi

393
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,680
places, they're very quiet, they're very low-key,

394
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,880
they're very nice little places, but Wasabi's a frickin' sports bar, okay? They play, like,

395
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,880
basketball games on the TV and stuff, and then it just so happens that you have

396
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,360
sushi there. It's a sushi bar.

397
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:46,360
And I mean bar. Like, emphasis on the bar. It just has sushi. It's pretty good.

398
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,360
But they're loud. It's very loud and noisy.

399
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,360
Uhh, what else?

400
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:02,360
I have this whole list of things I was going to talk about, but I can't think of any, so I guess we'll just have to move on.

401
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,360
I wish I had some exciting DDR story to tell, but I really don't.

402
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,360
I haven't been to the arcade in a while. I'm still waiting for them to set up 2DX.

403
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,380
2DX. We're supposed to be getting 2DX here locally. That was supposed to happen, what,

404
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:18,040
four weeks ago? I guess they're waiting on a part, so we'll see. Loki. Loki has a comment.

405
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:25,800
It'll never happen. They'll just keep talking and hinting at it. The monitor will constantly

406
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,120
be in trend to us. It'll never happen. The machine's been...

407
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:35,800
I've been taking pictures of it. But there's no monitor. The monitor's gone.

408
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:45,800
Okay, you know, I don't know, they should like ghetto rig it.

409
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,800
Pimp my 2DX machine.

410
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,800
Hey, what was that idea for a TV show you were talking about earlier this week? I thought it was kind of cool.

411
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,800
Pimp my rig.

412
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,800
And what would happen on this show?

413
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:04,800
They would take someone's piece of shit computer and they'd make it pretty. And they'd case mod it.

414
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:25,360
kostjamrh Our show's come to a halt because we're trying to give Jamie chocolate right

415
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,360
now.

416
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,360
Gotta get your priorities in straight.

417
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,360
Chocolate first.

418
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,360
Legend of Zaku says he needs someone to pimp his PA skills.

419
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,360
Practice, practice.

420
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,360
That's what it takes.

421
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:45,360

And it's lots of fun.

425
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,360
L. Mullet made it funny.

426
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:59,360
He says once they pimp it, they can call it an apple.

427
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,360
Oh, I'm sorry. They're not removing all functionality out of it.

428
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,360
Or replacing the innards with a toaster.

429
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:14,360
I remember the old G4s, the transparent toasters. Those are great.

430
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:22,360
Alright, we're gonna go to a break. When we come back from this break, I guess we'll talk about some DDR stuff.

431
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,360
There's some stuff going on in the Bevani scene this week, and I suppose we can talk about it.

432
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,360
Might as well.

433
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,360
In this break, what?

434
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:37,360
Oh yeah, and Jamie has this really random Castlevania thing she wants to share with you guys, so we'll hook that up for later.

435
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:44,360
In this break, we're going to play some PlayStation 2DX songs, because I want to hear Cracker.

436
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,840
So we'll be back after this with more orange lounge radio

437
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,360
Taki no mienu tenka ni basen itto nai

Nari o miru nari o mo

454
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:28,660
Looking for the light of night in the world and I see where there is light gone

455
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:36,660
Look inside you came on between the world and the sea

456
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:40,660
Not past my future

457
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:43,660
Where it goes

458
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:46,660
Where the birds are going

459
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:53,660
The sunshine in a black dark forest

460
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:59,660
Hold your lies, don't you cry, cry, cry

461
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:05,660
There's a light on my tooth

462
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:11,660
Hold your lies, don't you smile, smile, smile

463
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:14,660
Yes, I can't listen

464
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,660
I want you

465
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:50,660
Let me show you what you can do with your life.

466
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:20,660
Oh,

467
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:24,660
oh

468
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:28,660
oh

469
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:32,660
oh

470
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:36,660
oh

471
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:40,660
oh

472
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:44,660
oh

473
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:41,660
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

474
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:47,900
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and Jamie wants to do something for you guys here.

475
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:52,380
This is a little bit random, it doesn't really have to do with Momani per se, but turn on

476
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:53,380
the satanic music.

477
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:54,380
What do we got there in the background?

478
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:56,180
It sounds satanic, it's churchy.

479
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,180
Sounds satanic to me.

480
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,820
I'm actually feeling better now that I stand up.

481
00:44:58,820 --> 00:44:59,820
Oh, that's good.

482
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:03,580
But you know, we've always made fun of Castlevania Symphony the night before the bad voice acting.

483
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:06,100
Right, and this has to do with the podcast from last week.

484
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,740
This kind of relates into the podcast.

485
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:10,580
And if you listen to it, you know what we were talking about.

486
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:17,580
Thank you. That's the plug I was going to make. If you haven't checked out the podcast yet, do it! www.orangeloungeradio.com

487
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:23,580
Click on Orange Lounge Radio to go. There's a whole extra 20 minute show that we do, and we talk about random shit like this.

488
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:30,580
Such as the voice acting in Castlevania Symphony of the Night. And a lot of you guys have played this game. God, this song scares the shit out of me.

489
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:39,580
Um, a lot of you...listen to Orange Lounge Radio. It is holy.

490
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:40,580
Oh, I didn't know it was going through.

491
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:45,580
Yeah, it's already going through. They can hear it. The holiest of internet radio. No, anyway.

492
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:46,580
I'm gonna go ahead and start playing.

493
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:50,580
Okay. So, you know the bad boys acting in Symphony of the Night is like,

494
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:55,580
Die, monster. You don't belong in this world. You know, it's really lame.

495
00:45:55,580 --> 00:46:01,040
So anyway, Jamie said she wanted to play for you all how much better the Japanese voice

496
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,460
acting is.

497
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,340
So she's going to do that for you guys.

498
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:10,460
Now this is the cool thing, if you're listening live on Sunday night, which I know obviously

499
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:14,980
right now you are, but some of you guys hear this show on the rebroadcast over on DDR Freak

500
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:19,580
Radio and all that stuff, you can actually see it on our webcam, www.orangetonsradio.com.

501
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:28,580
I would appreciate however those people sent copies of them, I will put this up on somewhere for people to see the images.

502
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:34,580
Now Missy is our usual webcam whore and she's not here tonight, so hopefully somebody else is saving pictures.

503
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:38,580
Save the pictures and after the show I'll give you my email address.

504
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:52,580
One gay man, one angsty woman, and one angry man. Orange Lounge Radio, coming to a theater near you.

505
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:57,580
I have a story on here. You know how they give you the whole story? It actually is different, but it's still written in English.

506
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:00,580
But they say it as your...

507
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:06,580
Okay. So now you actually have to play the game for a little bit to get to the opening.

508
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:09,080
You just wanted to play games on Orange Lawn's radio.

509
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,580
Isn't this in a Kiriyamoka track?

510
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:15,580
I don't know.

511
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:30,580
Isn't this great? You guys are tuned into an internet radio station, and you're not even watching somebody play games.

512
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:32,580
Oh, here we go.

513
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:04,580
If you don't like having fun with your friends,

514
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:09,580
then help each other out in search of great partner to meet a number of Xi.

515
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:13,580
If you love it, let's cheer on each other.

516
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:13,480
Otherwise,...?

517
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:15,580
What are you thinking of?

518
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:20,580
Are you comparing small with old entanglements?

519
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,580
Very large.

520
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:24,080
But you're over it.

521
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,080
That was what?

522
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,080
Hydro storm.

523
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:24,000
That was very hot.

524
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:33,000
I know this isn't Symphony of the Night, but I'm used to Symphony of the Night. It has the sexiest music. God, the music is so good.

525
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,880
intervened. Castlevania, the castle of Dracula, which is rumored to appear only once every

526
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:03,080
century, suddenly and mysteriously materialized. More text.

527
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:07,240
Meanwhile, powerful forces were at work in the lives of a man named Alucard, the very

528
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:12,840
same Alucard who had previously teamed up with Ralph C. Belmont to destroy his immortal

529
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:18,080
father Vlad Tepes, aka Count Dracula. Alucard, in order to rid the world of his own first

530
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:23,960
bloodline, sealed off his powers and entered into what was supposed to be an eternal slumber.

531
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,960
At the end of this is the line that they pissed off that they changed.

532
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:32,960
But now that sleep had been disturbed, now a card is aware of the evil that is once again arisen in this homeland.

533
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,960
The time has come once more for the forces of good and evil to engage in their ancient battles.

534
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,960
Jekyll's castle beckons for you.

535
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,960
And perhaps none but that bright and glaring moon can say who will triumph.

536
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,960
They changed that line. That pissed me off. That was so awesome.

537
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,960
This is just like watching Iron Chef.

538
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:51,960
Are those secret ingredients?

539
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,960
POTATO!

540
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,960
Let me bite this pepper.

541
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,960
And it says, JACULA X. That's so awesome.

542
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:07,960
This is actually supposed to be on the 32X.

543
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:10,960
You know?

544
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,960
Alright. Lovely.

545
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:14,960
You know...

546
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,960
All I gotta say is, uh...

547
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:24,960
Who's the man that resurrected Dracula?

548
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:26,960
Shit!

549
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:29,960
Can you dig it?

550
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:30,960
Oh yeah.

551
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,960
You're a dumbass.

552
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:37,960
Alright, alright.

553
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:39,960
Anyway...

554
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:54,960
Anyway, gave me just one excuse to play video games during the show. Alright. That was pretty cool though, I'd actually never heard that, the Japanese version. I think maybe you sent me bits and pieces, like on Wave.

555
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:59,960
I had a file of Alucard though, because I figured we wouldn't be getting to the part with Alucard, so I brought a file with him.

556
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:02,960
Did you want me to play that Little Wave sample?

557
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:03,960
In just a sec.

558
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:26,960
kostjamrh We'll be talking about Bobanis at some point this evening too, but let's face it, you know, there hasn't been a new game lately. Well, actually, there was a big new game this week. We don't really have an excuse to not be talking Bobani. We'll get to it, though. We will, we will.

559
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:35,960
Of course, Castlevania. I mean, a lot of you guys that play DDR, I know a lot of you guys are into Castlevania, too, and if you're not, you should be, because the music's good, the gameplay's good. Oh, yes, Jamie.

560
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:36,960
The file of Alucard?

561
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,960
Yes. You want it now?

562
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:39,960
Yeah.

563
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:40,960
Here it is.

564
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:52,960
That's it.

565
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,960
Yeah, but see, isn't the voice acting better?

566
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:00,460
But see, there's something about the American voice acting that's very charming.

567
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:03,460
Die, monster! You don't belong in this world!

568
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:04,460
It's cute!

569
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:05,960
Excuse me, Richter.

570
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,460
Hahahaha!

571
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,460
Ahhh, boy oh boy.

572
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:14,960
Alright.

573
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:18,460
Loki's gonna hook the webcam back up so you can stare at the couch again.

574
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:19,960
I'm gonna check on my laundry.

575
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,960
Alright, meanwhile, uh, we're gonna talk a little bit about some Bimani news.

576
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,960
There actually was a little bit of news this week, and we can talk about that.

577
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,960
This isn't Bomani. Okay, I'll talk about the Castlevania thing real fast.

578
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,960
But you know that Konami was making this big announcement on Thursday?

579
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,960
They were going to make a big announcement on January 27th, right?

580
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,960
Well, it turned out that the big announcement was just their 2005 lineup.

581
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,960
So, you know, you can see all the new Konami games that are coming out in 2005.

582
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,960
And of course, as suspected, and if you were paying attention to OrangeLawrenceRadio.com throughout the week,

583
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,580
the week you already knew this, but one of the games they announced was Castlevania Curse

584
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:59,260
of Darkness, which is going to be a brand new PlayStation 2 title. Very cool. And that's

585
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:03,260
in addition to the DS Castlevania game. So it's going to be a big year for Castlevania.

586
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:06,540
That's going to be cool. And then they announced some other games. A Ninja Turtles game is

587
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:13,880
in there. What else was there? There was a new Frogger game. Oh, and of course Metal

588
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:18,980
Gear Acid for the PSP. We all knew that was coming. So they announced all these games.

589
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:24,840
And then what was weird is that the same day, the exact same day, in unrelated news, but

590
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:29,620
they put out a press release on this, they did not announce any new DDR titles.

591
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:34,980
They did not announce any Xtreme 2, they did not announce UltraMix 3, they didn't announce

592
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:38,980
DDR with Mario for the US, they didn't announce any of that stuff.

593
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:44,580
But what they did do is that they published this press release saying, hey, guess what

594
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:54,980
kids, Dance Dance Revolution sold 1.2 million copies in North America in 2004. Now, that's

595
00:54:54,980 --> 00:55:00,780
across all titles, so we're talking Extreme and Ultramix 2 combined, along with, you know,

596
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:07,580
Ultramix 1 and Max 2. All those combined, all those sales totaled 1.2 million, but really,

597
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:12,380
for a game that requires an additional peripheral to play, not too shabby. Certainly higher

598
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:16,820
sales than any power pad game ever got right so that was 1.2 million copies in

599
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:23,460
2004 since DDR debuted in 2001 all the way back on Dance Dance Revolution on

600
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:30,100
the PlayStation 2.5 million copies of DDR games for the home consoles in the

601
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:37,080
US sold not too shabby right but then they didn't announce a new DDR game to

602
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:41,500
go along with that they just said gee isn't DDR great but honestly think

603
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:45,060
Think about it people, are they going to submit this press release and then say,

604
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:50,000
oh and by the way, because of DDR's great success, no more DDR games in the U.S.

605
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
It's done.

606
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
We're pulling the plug on DDR.

607
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
We're going out on the top.

608
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
That's right.

609
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,340
We're like, you know, we're like a TV sitcom like Friends or something.

610
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:02,500
We're going to go out while we're still on top.

611
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,640
I don't think so boys and girls, that's not quite how it works.

612
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:11,460
You can bet your sweet ass that we will see new games on PlayStation and Xbox this year

613
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:16,700
And we will probably see that GameCube game as well. I think it's just a foregone conclusion.

614
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:20,340
We just have to sit here and twiddle our thumbs until the details are announced, which probably

615
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:27,260
won't be until E3. Honestly. And that's that. Anything you want to add to that, Loki?

616
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:33,740
What's a GameCube? Smartass.

617
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:37,940
Jamie, anything you want to add to that?

618
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:39,940
Now, aren't you excited about new DDR on the console?

619
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:42,940
I am if I... Yeah, I am.

620
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:49,940
Now, this is what I'm thinking. How many copies of a video game do you think it would take to sell to call it a success?

621
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:53,940
A successful... How many copies does a successful video game sell?

622
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:54,940
Two.

623
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:57,940
Come on. Like a hundred thousand?

624
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:58,940
That's decent.

625
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:00,940
A hundred thousand would be really decent, right?

626
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:09,940
Now, if one out of every ten people that bought DDR in 2004 were to support a, I don't know,

627
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:17,420
another music game that Konami would put out, say Beatmania 2DX. If you could convince one

628
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:21,300
out of every ten people that bought DDR that Beatmania 2DX is a good idea, one out of every

629
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:24,620
ten, you'd have a successful game on your hands.

630
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:37,620
If you could say, convince those same one out of ten people to, I don't know, say support an online music game related radio show, we would be rich.

631
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:43,620
Yeah, I know, I know. Man can dream.

632
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:53,620
Whereas the figure is actually more like one out of every million actually support that internet, because that would make it what, two? Yeah, that's about how many listeners we have, two.

633
00:57:53,620 --> 00:58:03,860
to. All right. And everyone else is expecting to hear, you know, Tomosuke and the rest of,

634
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:09,100
you know, the Orange Lounge radio band because they think that this shows... You know, there's

635
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:12,700
been so many people out there that have actually thought that Orange Lounge radio is related

636
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:17,020
to Orange Lounge that we finally put a disclaimer on the website at the very, very bottom in

637
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:22,100
little text. Note, Orange Lounge radio is not affiliated with Orange Lounge the band

638
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:31,020
from DDR and 2DX and all that. Sorry. Tomosuke does have his own site. It's out there. We

639
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:36,100
had a link to it once. Just put Orange Lounge into Google and it's the site that comes up

640
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:43,260
before Orange Lounge Radio? Yes. Before I let my pet peeve bug me anymore, it's Tomosuke.

641
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:54,140
Sorry. I'm white. Alright. I just, I don't know why. I know a lot of people fear, have

642
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:59,380
this fear that if they bring out 2DX in America it's gonna be fucked up, but I kinda don't

643
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:06,160
care. I just really want them to do it. Even if it isn't as good as 2DX's seventh, eighth,

644
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:10,780
ninth style that's coming out soon, even if it's not that good, give us some new songs.

645
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:15,580
give us something, something to make it US and I'd be happy. A lot of people would be

646
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:25,940
very, very happy if you do it. That's my plea. What can you do? Alright. Any other comments

647
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:32,340
on BeatMania 2DX USA and the hopes and dreams of seeing it happen? We wish, we wish. I know.

648
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:37,520
Not going to happen, but whatever. See, now Jamie, listen up pessimists. Jamie, you usually

649
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:43,280
prefer the Japanese mixes to American mixes, usually the games and stuff, but you still

650
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,600
would want to see a 2DX U.S. mix.

651
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:46,600
Absolutely.

652
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:47,600
Why?

653
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,280
Just to have it out here.

654
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,320
Another 2DX game to waste my money on, exactly.

655
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,320
Seriously.

656
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:58,460
I still have to find a copy of Fourth Style somewhere.

657
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:00,720
And I understand what they're saying in the chat room there, they're saying if you were

658
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:05,220
to bring 2DX to the U.S. it would have to appeal to the U.S. gamers.

659
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:09,340
You only have to appeal to one out of every ten people that bought DDR last year to make

660
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:15,260
this game a success. That's all I'm saying. One out of every ten should not be that hard.

661
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:23,700
If Donkey Konga can be a success, 2DX can be a success. You know it. I know this in

662
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:28,340
my heart. A lot of 2DX elitists, I'm not saying everybody that plays 2DX is a 2DX elitist,

663
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:32,680
but a lot of 2DX elitists out there would have you believe that the masses don't want

664
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:38,760
to eat up a game like 2DX. But whenever I play 2DX in the arcades, there's always these

665
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:43,840
people that stand around kind of watching going, ooh, ah, just like with DDR. It's got

666
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:52,500
a lot of that same appeal to it. I don't know. We'll see. We're going to take a break. We'll

667
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:56,800
be back. And I guess we'll open up the Skype line. I'm sure some of you guys out there

668
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:00,400
want to make a comment on this, I'm sure. So if you want to know what the Skype line

669
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:05,720
is all about, go to www.orangelaundraider.com and click on interact with us and it has all

670
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:11,320
the information you need there in order to interact with the program via the Skype line.

671
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:17,240
Meanwhile we're going to play some music and in this break I want to do some Para Para

672
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:23,080
music so we're going to do that and we're going to start it off with some Ali Japan.

673
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:30,080
Sounds Like Fun, and we'll be back after this.

674
01:01:53,080 --> 01:02:05,080
This is meant to be together, a wish upon a dream forever

675
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:15,080
Now our heroes will play the game, and we will see you in front of us

676
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:18,080
Are you ready for this fight tonight?

677
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:26,080
Who is that who's trying to see you will play me your part?

678
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:30,080
I need your plan

679
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,080
We're gonna sing for you

680
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,080
O-re-o-re

681
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:36,080
I need your plan

682
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:38,080
Come be the jersey, yo

683
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:39,080
O-re-o-re

684
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:43,080
I need your plan

685
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:44,580
We're gonna sing for you

686
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:49,080
O-le-o-le, A-le-ja-la-n

687
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:51,080
You'll be the champion

688
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:55,580
O-le-o-le, A-le-ja-la-n

689
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:32,580
A bad body to the music sound down A bad body to the music sound through

690
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:35,580
A bad body to the music sound through

691
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:38,580
I'm still alive, I've got fucking soul to cast down

692
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:40,580
I'm still alive

693
01:03:40,580 --> 01:04:04,580
Come on baby, come on boy Won't you really be the only one in Tokyo?

694
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:37,580
A bad fight is the future coming

695
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:38,580
You're all mine

696
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:40,580
A bad fun, 2000, calm down

697
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:42,580
Come down, let's do it

698
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:17,580
He's gonna listen to my word

699
01:07:40,580 --> 01:08:01,940
Whoops, forgot to queue up a promo there that says we're coming back, my bad.

700
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:03,940
Let me, uh, put something up there.

701
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:19,940
Hi-ho! Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

702
01:08:19,940 --> 01:08:25,940
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

703
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:28,940
There we go! Now we can come back.

704
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:29,940
Hello boys and girls.

705
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:37,940
You know the DDR Freak was down earlier this evening, but it's back up now. I guess they were having some server problems.

706
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:42,940
DDR Freak was down and then didn't you try to get on Bamani style and they were down too? Everybody's broken!

707
01:08:42,940 --> 01:08:44,940
They all broke!

708
01:08:46,940 --> 01:08:47,940
What can you do?

709
01:08:47,940 --> 01:08:49,940
But now the DDR Freak is...

710
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:56,940
Now the DDR Freak is back up, I went over to the Mod of the Month thread and I voted for Jamie.

711
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:57,940
I voted for you for Mod of the Month.

712
01:08:57,940 --> 01:09:01,540
of the month. Thank you. I'm not gonna win. I know you're not, because a bunch of people

713
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:04,500
went in there and flooded for somebody else. But that's okay, you should still vote for

714
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:15,340
Jamie. Do it! Do it! Alright. Anyway, I was asked to pass along, our buddy explicit, who's

715
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:19,660
usually here at the show, you know, he has a lot of FUs, he sent along a little private

716
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:23,720
message to me over on Orange Lounge Radio, and he wanted me to share some stuff with

717
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:29,960
you guys about the upcoming tournament that's happening on what Saturday this

718
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:33,680
Saturday Saturday February 5th piss is happening this Saturday so excited

719
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:40,360
Paradise Island Smacktown sack down or smack sack Smacktown sack down if I have

720
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:46,680
a lot to drink tonight piss might happen even earlier the Paradise Island

721
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:52,280
sacktown Smackdown is happening this Saturday February 5th and they're gonna

722
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:58,280
They're going to have the P.A. pneumonia, like pan pneumonia. Get it? P.A. and pneumonia. Pan pneumonia.

723
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:00,280
That's their version of perfect attack.

724
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:04,280
And they're going to have a showstopper freestyle contest. That should be fun.

725
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:09,280
And, get your ice rockets ready, an initial D grand prix.

726
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:12,280
Joy and joy. That should be fun.

727
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:13,280
Golden shower sprawl.

728
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:14,280
Shut up.

729
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:23,640
explicit asked me to pass along some updates to the tournament they've

730
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:27,480
actually lowered some of the prices which is nice so if you were thinking

731
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:33,000
about it they've actually lowered the price to get into freestyle and try to

732
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:40,400
pull up the latest update and let's see freestyle price has been reduced to $10

733
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:43,420
There's only eight if you're pre-registered.

734
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:47,540
So if you want to pre-register, go to DDR Freak, now that it's back up.

735
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:51,860
Go to DDR Tournament Chat, or whatever that forum's called, and look for the Paradise

736
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:52,860
Island thread.

737
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:55,520
And yes, I know that's a local tournament, so those of you guys on the East Coast probably

738
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:59,760
are not feasibly going to be going to this, but I did promise we would put that little

739
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,720
local plug.

740
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:06,680
And at some point during the tournament, I do plan on making a cameo.

741
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:09,040
I'm going to dabble in the piss for a little bit.

742
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:11,220
Are you going to get your hands wet?

743
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:14,620
I'm going to go get my hands wet at piss.

744
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:15,620
Okay we'll stop.

745
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:16,620
Seriously.

746
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:22,100
Oh, damn.

747
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:23,100
Looking forward to piss.

748
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:24,740
It'll be fun.

749
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:28,460
But don't call it that in front of him because he'll get really mad.

750
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:32,340
He was a really good sport here at the show the other week.

751
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:34,940
We'll get you the full piss rundown next Sunday on the show.

752
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:36,180
Hey, he should have not mentioned it.

753
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:37,180
We would have never thought about it.

754
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:41,180
I would have never thought, and I'm kind of stupid.

755
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:43,180
It's all his fault. He can only go to himself.

756
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:46,180
I know, I know. All right.

757
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:48,180
Let's see, moving on.

758
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:51,180
Loki, I know you've been following this a little better than I have,

759
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:56,180
but I know there was some big news in the Europe DDR scene this week.

760
01:11:56,180 --> 01:12:01,180
Yeah, they announced their new Dancing Stage game,

761
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:04,180
which I remember had a really dumb name to it.

762
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:09,180
It's like Dancing Stage Fusion. It's like Dancing Stage Happy Fun Time.

763
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:12,180
I don't know what the hell it's called, but it's like something.

764
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:15,180
Anyways, and it's got all the crap that was in...

765
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:17,180
It's Dancing Stage Fusion.

766
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:20,180
No, it's not Dancing Stage Fusion. It's called something else.

767
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:22,180
Hold on. I'm going to look at these pictures here.

768
01:12:22,180 --> 01:12:24,180
Oh, Dancing Stage Day Glow Mix. Was that it?

769
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:26,180
Day Glow Mix. That's what it was.

770
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:29,180
No, no, no. That was what somebody said they should call it.

771
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:31,180
That's not what they really call it.

772
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:37,260
at the pictures of the cabinet. Let's see, it's Dancing Stage Fusion. That's what somebody

773
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:41,660
on Freaks said it should be called because of the way it looked. See, Dancing Stage,

774
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:46,040
not Dayquil. Whatever. Anyway, so yeah, Dancing Stage Fusion. It's got all the same stuff

775
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:52,160
as the home version. Plus, a few other licensed songs I saw were on there, which you can read

776
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:57,000
off for me since I don't have the list in front of me. Well now, okay, this is what's

777
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:01,120
interesting is that imagine if you took Extreme USA and put it in a cabinet and

778
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:04,760
change the song list a little bit that's pretty much what you got with this mix

779
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:10,360
yes what sounds like anyway here's the song list three two one stars a a stupid

780
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:16,340

783
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:32,280
heaven and earth which i think is a licensed song it's raining men you know

784
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:38,240
that one kakumei keep on moving kids in america ladies night la senorita and la

785
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:42,520

787
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:58,360
The Rage Mix, Rapper's Delight, A Hip Hop, A Hip It To The Hop, Still In My Heart, Sink,

788
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:08,920
Tomorrow Perfume, Tough Enough, Trip Machine, Try To Love You, Une De Toi, Waiting For Tonight,

789
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:12,820
You're Not Here, and Your Rain, The Rage Mix.

790
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:16,720
And that's not all of them, that's just what was on the demo cabinet that they had.

791
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:21,420
not everything that's gonna be on this mix. Not everything that's gonna be in there, there's a lot more stuff.

792
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:26,220
So, um, it looks pretty good so far, but, I mean, granted, it's just exactly like

793
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:29,580
Dancy Stage Fusion, or DDR Extreme,

794
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:32,180
you know, the home versions.

795
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:35,900
But hey, it's something new, so, yay!

796
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:38,800
I wonder if they're gonna bring anything over here. Probably not.

797
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:42,840
Who knows, you might get lucky, some of them might import it, I don't see why not, I mean,

798
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:49,080
People import stuff from, you know, Korea and, you know, China and Japan and stuff.

799
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:50,320
Why not from Europe?

800
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:53,400
I mean, it makes sense to me.

801
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,940
But that's what's going on.

802
01:14:55,940 --> 01:15:06,120
And I don't think they really announced when they're going to be releasing that, but we're

803
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:09,480
thinking probably the end of this year.

804
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:12,920
I think it'll be sooner than that.

805
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:16,760
Whatever. You know they were showing In the Groove at this show too.

806
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:20,720
Yeah, that was right. The In the Groove was being shown by,

807
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:24,320
I forget what company it was, Bingoist. They had boasted that

808
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:27,440
their, um, what was it?

809
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:30,920
They have, um, at the show they had gotten

810
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:34,560
200 orders for In the Groove for the UK.

811
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:38,000
So that was kinda interesting. And they, um, officially announced

812
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,560
in the group to that was the other thing surprise which they

813
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:44,920
I mean didn't really give any details on it they said yeah we're gonna make one

814
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:49,640
so

815
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:53,280
I don't have another in the group debate on the show maybe they'll fix some of

816
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:54,880
the problems with one in two

817
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:59,240
but I don't know I'm I them the longer longer this goes on

818
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:02,520
the more and more I'm buying into the theory of Konami that's what you get

819
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:06,080
for not putting out any more arcade mixes honestly

820
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:10,520
they deserve in the groove to be out there at this point I just I don't know

821
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:14,560
but I still think if they try to release in the groove on a home console there's

822
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:19,320
gonna be issues I still say that and you can argue all you want but I'm welcome

823
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:24,560
to my opinion so I can't wait for him to try I I really hope I hope I hope they

824
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:28,200
do try to release on a home console so we can have this debate and get it over

825
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:37,600
with. Seriously. If anything, to watch a show like X play Rip It Apart. Well, I don't know.

826
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:44,880
I don't know if they would. I mean, a lot of, the casual gamer doesn't give a shit.

827
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:50,600
Right? True. That's how, you know, pieces of crap like Britney's Dance Beat get out

828
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:57,040
there and get played. I mean, people call Pump It Up that dance game and don't realize

829
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:02,040
You know what ever happened to fucking Pump It Up coming to the Japanese PlayStation 2?

830
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:05,040
That's a game that should be, you know, fucking brought over here.

831
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:11,040
I mean, it's doing well in, like, all these other countries, but, you know, no one wants to bring it over here, obviously, because of the lawsuits and shit.

832
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:22,040
But yet, stuff like, you know, fucking In The Groove gets out there, I don't understand how, you know, one can be okay and the other one can't.

833
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:24,040
You see what I'm saying?

834
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:32,760
don't know so I don't get it but nothing's going on all right I promised

835
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:36,540
that we would open up the Skype line so that's exactly what I'm gonna do if you

836
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:41,540
want to call into the show head on over to www.orangelanosradio.com and click

837
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:48,440
on interact with us I do request Skype actually upgraded to version 1.1 earlier

838
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:51,500
this week or no I'm sorry actually was earlier this month it was a little while

839
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:56,380
ago and they have some new features in it so make sure you're upgrade the

840
01:17:56,380 --> 01:18:02,060
latest version hi you're on orange ons radio like Dennis Aku here hello Zaku

841
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:08,080
how are you fine what's on your mind well I'm just looking over you know now

842
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:12,540
that DDR frequent went back up again I was looking over the Dancing States thread

843
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:17,460
and apparently to my surprise during them for some reason during it during

844
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:35,460
During the whole event, I looked at, you know, I saw two pictures, one of a person, you know, one of the, you know, Konami's area where they had Fusion, there was only one girl playing, and another one with the Pump It Up Exceed 2 section, where there's like, what, uh, ten, like thirty, like about forty people right there carding up.

845
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:38,460
Yeah, it's one of the most recent posts on the thread, I know what you're talking about.

846
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:46,460
Yes, and I'm surprised, I thought we were supposed to be behind something like this 100%. I don't get it.

847
01:18:46,460 --> 01:19:00,460
Well, from the looks of it, it looks like that there was some type of event going on at the Pump It Up booth, and so all those people were there, and whereas Dancing Stage just kind of had the machine out there.

848
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:11,460
Hmm, I don't know, I guess I don't know if I should accept that as an excuse. Anyways, now that we have, now that DDR itself already hit at least 1.2 billion last year...

849
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:20,460
Zach, I just want to say, for all you know, I mean, we don't know because we weren't there, but for all we know, there was a topless girl playing Pump It Up at that moment.

850
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:22,460
Really? Not just...

851
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:27,460
For all you know, so you don't know why all those people were there, but that's one possible reason.

852
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:31,460
If you look at the picture, they all kind of have that, ooh, boobies look on their face.

853
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:47,460
Right. Anyways, now that DDR has already sold 1.2 million last year, totaling up to 2.5 million, which, if I'm not mistaken, should almost count for a quarter of all DDR sales worldwide.

854
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:50,460
I'm going on fuzzy math right now.

855
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:52,460
I don't have the latest figures.

856
01:19:52,460 --> 01:20:00,460
This should be the perfect opportunity to justify a new arcade mix.

857
01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:05,460
We already have the evidence that this game is profitable in this country.

858
01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:10,460
And so, I don't know, there has to be something done, some sort of action.

859
01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:14,460
We already know people who can make it happen.

860
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:24,380
If that doesn't happen, we just got to push, you know, we got to basically, you know, we just got to stay on top of this 110%, you know what I'm saying?

861
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:34,140
Well, I hear what you're saying, honestly, you're preaching to the choir here, you're preaching to the choir here, I'm not going to disagree with you, you are absolutely right, I think that we need to be doing a new USA mix.

862
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:36,140
We got proof, we have just...

863
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:39,140
But, I think that the people who...

864
01:20:39,140 --> 01:20:41,140
Yeah, we got to get a new arcade mix.

865
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:45,620
People who have made it happen previously are trying to make it happen again.

866
01:20:45,620 --> 01:20:48,260
I don't know this for a fact, but I would assume.

867
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:51,540
I know that there's people that love DDR trying to make it happen.

868
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:56,860
I don't doubt that they're trying again, but you know, sometimes it's a matter of it's

869
01:20:56,860 --> 01:20:58,340
just got to be the right time.

870
01:20:58,340 --> 01:21:00,400
You got to get the people to say the right thing.

871
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:03,340
I don't know what it's going to take.

872
01:21:03,340 --> 01:21:10,100
But you don't see silent scope websites out there.

873
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:14,860
You don't see Silent Scope websites out there with 50,000 dedicated members.

874
01:21:14,860 --> 01:21:20,020
To my knowledge, there is no internet radio station dedicated to the game Silent Scope.

875
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:21,220
And there's two for DDR.

876
01:21:21,220 --> 01:21:22,540
We can definitely start.

877
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:23,540
We could start one.

878
01:21:23,540 --> 01:21:24,680
This is a cult following.

879
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:28,660
You have a game here that...

880
01:21:28,660 --> 01:21:29,660
That's the thing.

881
01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:30,660
You have a cult following.

882
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:36,700
You have people who love this game to the point that it consumes their lives to an extent.

883
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:42,700
They basically, you know, they have purpose to make something happen.

884
01:21:42,700 --> 01:21:46,700
And in this case, we could go after a new arcade mix.

885
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:55,700
The thing is, we gotta make sure we gotta preach to the choir, to people who have seen the sites.

886
01:21:55,700 --> 01:22:02,700
That way we start some sort of movement that could be legitimate and aiming towards a common goal.

887
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:07,760
Okay, your voice is fading out a little bit here. We had some weird connection issues in your last statement there.

888
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:14,100
But I got the gist of what you're saying there. You just, you would like to see the masses get together and do something.

889
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,360
Basically.

890
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:23,240
I think... I doubt I would, you know, I doubt to see something that perfect, but you know, it's worth a shot.

891
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:25,840
I think the most we can do as fans right now,

892
01:22:26,220 --> 01:22:31,440
continue to support the games. When the home mixes come out, buy the new home mixes as they come out,

893
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:36,480
support the arcade mixes that are already out there and you know just keep

894
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:41,760
showing that there's a demand out there for dance games and I hate to say it but

895
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:46,360
maybe supporting in the groove god I can't believe I just said that would

896
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:50,840
show folks that there's still a demand out there for dance games although I

897
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:56,960
don't know I mean I still have mixed feelings on in the groove yeah all right

898
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:07,960
Well, I'm going to let you go, buddy, because we've got connection issues, but I understand what you're saying, and I hope we can all band together in one happy Bamani Rainbow family.

899
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:10,960
Take care, Zaku. Have a good one.

900
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:18,960
I think he was behind. I think he, like, it was weird. I think he was hearing us about five seconds after we said something. Maybe that's a weird Skype thing, I don't know.

901
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:21,960
Anything you guys want to add to that?

902
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:25,960
No? All right.

903
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:28,920
well skype lines open again if somebody else wants to give us a call

904
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:32,240
we certainly would love to hear what you have to say

905
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:35,300
otherwise I guess we're gonna go ahead and get into the orange launch radio cage

906
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:37,080
match next so it'd be something exciting

907
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:41,200
I'm checking out what's going on in the chat room there

908
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:45,720
I'm

909
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:48,700
basically the chat room just kinda saying didn't so-and-so say that there

910
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:50,000
was going to be a new mix

911
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:55,480
didn't so-and-so say this now honestly until Konami puts out the press release

912
01:23:55,480 --> 01:24:03,640
it's all hearsay all right I guess what we'll do is we're going to close down

913
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:06,840
the skyline for right now and what we'll do is we'll go into the Orange Andreo

914
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:09,880
cage match and we'll open it back up again after the cage match so if you

915
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:14,700
were thinking about calling in and you want to later then oh actually we're

916
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:18,360
getting a call right now I'll go ahead and take this one hi you're on Orange

917
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:20,360
Hey, what's going on? This is Phoenix.

918
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:22,360
Hello Phoenix, how are you?

919
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:25,360
Hey.

920
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:26,360
What's on your mind?

921
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:31,360
Hello? What's on your mind?

922
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:35,360
Can you hear me, buddy? What's on your mind?

923
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:36,360
Hey, what's going on?

924
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:41,360
Not much, just, uh, I wanted to say hey to Jamie. Hope she's feeling better.

925
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:45,360
I don't know. Just chilling out, you know? Listening to the show.

926
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:48,920
show. Jamie's in the kitchen getting herself a drink so she can feel a little

927
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:56,720
better there. Yeah. Anything on your mind, any comments, response to things

928
01:24:56,720 --> 01:25:00,680
we've been talking about in the show so far, such as the new Europe DDR mix or

929
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:07,440
you know? I don't know, there just needs to be a new DDR for the US. It's just bogus

930
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:12,200
that they would just drop it like that. Well there will be a new US mix, it's

931
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:16,520
just the home it's kind of focused on home right now it is kind of weird well

932
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:21,240
if you think about it though the US arcade mix has stopped a long long time

933
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:25,600
ago they really did we only ever had one true US arcade mix and it was kind of a

934
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:29,760
mediocre game at best but it's the Japanese ones that have really stopped

935
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:34,880
yeah it was sort of shaky there but I don't know I think they could do if they

936
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:37,800
really wanted to they could do what they wanted they could come out with a good

937
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:41,620
one yeah I know I know and it's you know what's interesting though is that you

938
01:25:41,620 --> 01:25:45,320
I don't see Konami of Japan putting out this press release going,

939
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:49,080
ooh, DDR Festival sold 1.2 million copies this year.

940
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:51,240
You didn't see that press release.

941
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:52,240
Yeah, that is true.

942
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:55,120
I mean, I don't know.

943
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:56,240
I don't know.

944
01:25:56,240 --> 01:25:58,640
It just seems like a lot of this stuff is going down.

945
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:03,280
Like, those websites that got shut down the other night, what was it?

946
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:06,120
DDR UK and stuff?

947
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:06,920
Well, I don't know.

948
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:09,680
Are you talking about like DDR UK getting shut down?

949
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:11,680
Yeah, those websites getting shut down.

950
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:18,680
Yeah, but we know that it has nothing to do with Konami. That was more of the MP3s in the song pack, at least assumably.

951
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:23,680
Now, we're making a lot of assumptions here, but assumably, it was the MP3s that were inside the song packs.

952
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:30,680
And remember that, if I'm not mistaken, Loki, correct me if I'm wrong, I wasn't a big DDRUK user, but they didn't just have the official song packs.

953
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:36,680
They had fan ones too, right? Am I correct? Because they did contests and stuff, right?

954
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:47,680
They didn't have those, but they had links to, like, the shoey, whatever, his little, like, museum, symphile museum stuff, which I'm sure had a lot of crap in it.

955
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:59,680
Yeah, well, I don't know. I would just, I think StepMania and stuff like that, people are gonna get into that more and move that way, you know, because that's customizable to how you want it.

956
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:09,680
And I agree, and I think a lot of the cult scene is kind of in there as it is, but until Stepmania is something that's over the counter, I don't think it's a real threat.

957
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:11,680
Yeah, that is true, though.

958
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:16,680
It just kind of keeps the cult thing going, and I think that's why Konami hasn't stepped in and done anything about it.

959
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:20,680
But I think if Stepmania were to be something that was sold over the counter, well, then there'd be an issue.

960
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:25,680
But then again, what is in the groove? In the groove is Stepmania, basically.

961
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:26,680
That is, yeah.

962
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:32,120
so I don't know, but until, and that's why I say that I don't think Konami's gonna do

963
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:36,920
anything about In the Groove unless they try to invade on the home market, but of course,

964
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:40,000
you know, In the Groove says they have the patents, okay, whatever, fine, I'm not gonna

965
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:44,680
dispute that, but I do think if they try to go to the home route, there's gonna be a bit

966
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:49,920
of, uh, clashing heads there, because that's Konami's baby right now, it's obviously, they're

967
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:52,920
putting out press releases on it, you know it's their baby, so.

968
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:56,920
I mean, they have to be planning to do something to put out a press release.

969
01:27:56,920 --> 01:28:01,920
I mean, that would just be silly to be like, we sold a million copies and then drop it.

970
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:05,920
I was just a little disappointed that they didn't announce anything the same day.

971
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:08,920
We all know that DDR Mario is in the making in Japan.

972
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:13,920
So, why not tell us U.S. folks who are going to get it? Because we better be getting it.

973
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:17,920
I'm not liking the DDR Mario. I think that's going to be a little bogus.

974
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:21,240
I think Mario's a little played out. That was sorta

975
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:24,960
in the 90s. Regardless, love or hate Mario,

976
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:29,120
it's more DDR. Yeah, that is true. So, I don't know.

977
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:33,560
Alright, any other comments you got for us? No, that's pretty much about it.

978
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:38,360
Just wanted to call in. It's my first time. Well, thank you for calling in. It's your virgin

979
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:39,640
phone call. We appreciate it.

980
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:43,240
We're glad to initiate you into Orange Lounge. Ha, ha, ha, ha.

981
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:46,280
And Jamie, he did say, you may have missed it because you were in the kitchen, but he did say he

982
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:47,160
hopes you feel better.

983
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:49,160
Thank you, I do too.

984
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:27,160
Remember boys and girls, in order to participate in the cage match, you must be in our chat room. www.orangelaungeradio.com, click on chat.

985
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:33,160
The way the cage match works, we play three songs for your listening pleasure or listening displeasure.

986
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:44,160
You pick your favorite. The winning song per the chat room goes into rotation all week long here on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music and More program.

987
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:48,560
Which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week when we're not live?

988
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:52,520
You get to hear a clip of last week's winner because

989
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:56,120
supposedly you were already listening last week or the week before, so you've heard

990
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:57,200
the whole song already.

991
01:29:57,200 --> 01:30:00,880
So here's a clip of last week's winner. It's a group called

992
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:04,680
Echo Image. They did the song Skulk in UltraMix 2, you know,

993
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:07,800
and they have a new song. It's called Endless Day.

994
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:12,400
So it's last week's winner. It's been winning two weeks in a row now, so if it

995
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:16,560
wins tonight that'll be week number three halfway to retirement let's see if

996
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:23,560
we can do it. Here's a clip. Song number one, Echo Image, Endless Day.

997
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:52,560
But I once said I could be wrong

998
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:59,560
Yes, I have my reasons after all

999
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:07,560
Can't find the way to come, we're going back in time

1000
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:16,560
This girl is one of the only ones lost in her mind

1001
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:22,560
Make no mistake, you're gonna find another way

1002
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:31,560
Left behind, there's another and that's it

1003
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:37,560
And we fall

1004
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:52,560
And we fall

1005
01:31:52,560 --> 01:32:18,560
Depending on those words that once belonged They used to make much sense but I was wrong

1006
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:25,560
Embracing my events of yesterday

1007
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:32,560
Yes, I should see you walking my own way

1008
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:36,560
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

1009
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:42,560
To everyone we've done and back and done

1010
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:55,840
All right, though, song number one in tonight's cage match, Echo Image, Endless Day, a clip

1011
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:56,840
of that there.

1012
01:32:56,840 --> 01:33:01,640
All right, let's see if it does it again tonight, but we've got to get the challengers in.

1013
01:33:01,640 --> 01:33:03,960
First up is DarkSakurasPick.

1014
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:04,960
What'd you pick for us tonight?

1015
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:05,960
Some Eurobeat song.

1016
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:11,160
It's been a while since we've had some Eurobeat in the cage match.

1017
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:17,660
It's Dream, um, different version of Night of Fire, but it's a different mix of the sort of rock mix. I don't remember the name of it.

1018
01:33:17,660 --> 01:33:19,660
Now Dream originally did Night of Fire.

1019
01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:20,160
No.

1020
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:21,660
No, I thought they did. I'm sorry.

1021
01:33:21,660 --> 01:33:24,160
No, that was the guy who did Night of Fire.

1022
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:24,660
Oh, my bad.

1023
01:33:24,660 --> 01:33:26,160
And then Dream, I think, redid it.

1024
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:32,660
Okay, so we got Dream, and then they did Night of Fire, which you might know as a 2DX song or a Para Para song.

1025
01:33:32,660 --> 01:33:34,660
This isn't necessarily a Eurobeat version of it.

1026
01:33:34,660 --> 01:33:39,660
Right, this is a different version. It's Dream of Dream mix. Hmm.

1027
01:33:39,660 --> 01:33:42,660
So we shall see. Anything else you want to say about it?

1028
01:33:42,660 --> 01:33:43,660
No.

1029
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:45,660
Alright, here it is. Song number two.

1030
01:33:45,660 --> 01:33:48,660
Night of Fire, Dream of Dream Mix. Enjoy!

1031
01:34:15,660 --> 01:34:17,660
Don't go away

1032
01:34:21,660 --> 01:34:23,660
Don't go away

1033
01:37:23,660 --> 01:37:35,660
Night of fire!

1034
01:37:35,660 --> 01:37:43,660
Night of fire!

1035
01:37:43,660 --> 01:37:51,500
Alrighty, that was song number two, Dream with Night of Fire, the dream of dream mix.

1036
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:55,220
Did we here in the studio find that song to be dreamy?

1037
01:37:55,220 --> 01:37:56,220
Or not?

1038
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:57,220
Jamie.

1039
01:37:57,220 --> 01:37:58,220
I don't care.

1040
01:37:58,220 --> 01:38:02,460
I guess that's her final word on the matter.

1041
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:03,460
Uh, Loki.

1042
01:38:03,460 --> 01:38:04,460
No.

1043
01:38:04,460 --> 01:38:05,460
No, no, no.

1044
01:38:05,460 --> 01:38:06,460
No, no.

1045
01:38:06,460 --> 01:38:12,780
I was too listening to it, it's Night of Fire, what else do I need to know?

1046
01:38:12,780 --> 01:38:13,780
Weren't fucking listening to it.

1047
01:38:13,780 --> 01:38:14,780
Get your headphones on.

1048
01:38:14,780 --> 01:38:16,900
On one side of my head.

1049
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:18,900
Just like DJ's do.

1050
01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:24,340
no I'm sorry I did listen to it and you know what it's still night of fire so it

1051
01:38:24,340 --> 01:38:29,700
gets like a seven that's about it though no more because it is eurobeat the

1052
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:40,380
eurobeat part of it you know really I I had a lot of fear going into that but it

1053
01:38:40,380 --> 01:38:43,740
actually was pretty neat I actually thought it would be more eurobeat than

1054
01:38:43,740 --> 01:38:47,700
it ended up being it wasn't too bad it was kind of catchy I give it like an

1055
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:58,700
Angel. I like it. It's your beat. Your beat is fun. Um, eight and a half. Whatever. Close enough.

1056
01:38:58,700 --> 01:39:04,700
Alright, let's get into Loki's pick. Loki, what did you pick tonight?

1057
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:11,700
Um, my song is from a group called Osiris, and it's Oneness with the Universe, is what it's called.

1058
01:39:11,700 --> 01:39:13,860
off of them trans compilation I got a while back.

1059
01:39:16,260 --> 01:39:17,260
It's good. I don't know.

1060
01:39:19,660 --> 01:39:20,460
Alright, let's...

1061
01:39:21,260 --> 01:39:23,660
It's only because you don't wanna fuckin' hear Girls again.

1062
01:39:23,660 --> 01:39:27,100
And goddamnit, if this doesn't go in, you can expect Girls next week.

1063
01:39:27,100 --> 01:39:27,600
Got it?

1064
01:39:30,100 --> 01:39:33,860
We will see. Osiris. Oneness with the universe.

1065
01:39:33,860 --> 01:39:40,860
let's check it out song number three

1066
01:40:03,860 --> 01:40:09,860
And they do, don't they do, don't they do...

1067
01:40:11,860 --> 01:40:13,860
Oh, well done, y'all.

1068
01:40:14,860 --> 01:40:17,860
How can I stop you?

1069
01:40:17,860 --> 01:40:25,860
We can make it through, we can do, can do, can do

1070
01:41:17,860 --> 01:41:19,860
Oh

1071
01:43:47,860 --> 01:44:12,860
Let's see what folks thought of Osiris, Oneness with the Universe.

1072
01:44:12,860 --> 01:44:16,860
Were we oneness with that song or were we better off without that song?

1073
01:44:16,860 --> 01:44:24,860
uh, i'm drugged, and it was enhancing my drugged state of mind, so it gets a 7.

1074
01:44:24,860 --> 01:44:26,860
alright, uh, loki!

1075
01:44:28,860 --> 01:44:36,860
i don't know, the clip i listened to was good, but no, the whole song was just eh, why did i put it in there? fucking a, i should've put girls in there again.

1076
01:44:36,860 --> 01:44:38,860
that's right, next week.

1077
01:44:39,860 --> 01:44:40,860
score?

1078
01:44:40,860 --> 01:44:49,700
I get the four because it sounded too much like you know and yeah that song

1079
01:44:49,700 --> 01:44:54,060
you know what with that song I could really picture myself at a rave taking a

1080
01:44:54,060 --> 01:45:01,340
nap boring five angel it was okay but you know how those type of songs are

1081
01:45:01,340 --> 01:45:06,700
they get kind of repetitive so I was semi zoning out at the end of it so I'll

1082
01:45:06,700 --> 01:45:08,700
I'll be nice and give it a six.

1083
01:45:10,700 --> 01:45:14,700
Wow. Angel usually doesn't give anything below a nine. That's pretty harsh.

1084
01:45:14,700 --> 01:45:19,700
Alright, let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight.

1085
01:45:19,700 --> 01:45:24,700
Song number one, Endless Day with, I'm sorry, Echo Image with Endless Day.

1086
01:45:24,700 --> 01:45:47,060
Song number two, Dream with Night of Fire, the Dream of Dream mix.

1087
01:45:47,060 --> 01:45:52,060
This is song number three, Osiris, Oneness with the Universe.

1088
01:45:52,060 --> 01:46:07,060
Alright, place vote now, send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

1089
01:46:07,060 --> 01:46:10,060
You know he's right, when you listen to a little clip of that song it sounds pretty cool.

1090
01:46:10,060 --> 01:46:16,060
Alright, if I were to just play the clips, I probably would have given that song like a nine.

1091
01:46:16,060 --> 01:46:18,060
Alright.

1092
01:46:18,060 --> 01:46:23,060
Maybe we'll do that for the cage match one night. It'll just be a clip match.

1093
01:46:23,060 --> 01:46:26,060
Then we can put like 30 songs in it would be awesome.

1094
01:46:26,060 --> 01:46:27,060
Alright, we'll see.

1095
01:46:27,060 --> 01:46:31,060
Uh, so send a private, remember private message.

1096
01:46:31,060 --> 01:46:34,060
Some folks are yelling out their votes in the chat room.

1097
01:46:34,060 --> 01:46:38,060
Doesn't work that way. Send a private message. If you don't know how to do that, ask.

1098
01:46:38,060 --> 01:46:40,060
All I gotta do is ask.

1099
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:46,060
Hi Bugd, I noticed Bugd walked into the room while we were doing the cage match there.

1100
01:46:46,060 --> 01:46:53,060
Another local Techmaster type person, not THE Techmassa of Orange Lawns Radio, but A Techmassa.

1101
01:46:53,060 --> 01:47:00,060
Wait, get a mic, we can't hear you. He says get a mic.

1102
01:47:00,060 --> 01:47:06,060
That's the best shirt ever.

1103
01:47:06,060 --> 01:47:10,060
Bugs is wearing a shirt that says, will work for bandwidth.

1104
01:47:10,060 --> 01:47:14,060
And it's true. I have.

1105
01:47:14,060 --> 01:47:18,060
Unfortunately, you are not THE Tecmasa of Oranzons Radio.

1106
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:22,060
Who do I have to kill? Loki. And then probably you'd have to kill VXJs

1107
01:47:22,060 --> 01:47:26,060
and XV2, because really, he's a big tech guy for this station too.

1108
01:47:26,060 --> 01:47:30,060
He's more of the web god slash internet penis.

1109
01:47:30,060 --> 01:47:34,060
Then Loki's a Tecmasa, you're just

1110
01:47:34,060 --> 01:47:36,060
A Techmaster.

1111
01:47:36,060 --> 01:47:37,060
Okay, I can live with A.

1112
01:47:37,060 --> 01:47:39,060
Like, you're from another department.

1113
01:47:41,060 --> 01:47:43,060
I'll take Techmaster Overlord.

1114
01:47:45,060 --> 01:47:47,060
That might work, we'll see.

1115
01:47:48,060 --> 01:47:51,060
You were a Techmaster before being a Techmaster was cool, really.

1116
01:47:51,060 --> 01:47:52,060
This is very true.

1117
01:47:54,060 --> 01:47:57,060
Bugden and I went to not only high school together, but junior high school together.

1118
01:47:57,060 --> 01:48:00,060
A long time ago. I know Bugden a long fucking time.

1119
01:48:00,060 --> 01:48:02,060
And I know Rob's real name. It's Robert.

1120
01:48:30,060 --> 01:48:34,500
gets for not putting out a new arcade mix lately. Well now, In the Groove is

1121
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:39,240
going to have some competition. It's a game called Dance Tracks and it's

1122
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:43,080
another new game being put out by some folks. Loki, have you heard about this one

1123
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:50,480
at all? No, I don't keep my finger on the pulse of crap. Well, here we go. You can

1124
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:58,120
actually look at this website if you want to. dtx.pulsenetwork.net. I will be

1125
01:48:58,120 --> 01:49:03,760
be so kind as to post a link in the chatroom there, if you want. Now, there really isn't

1126
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:09,260
a whole lot there besides a lot of blue, but they do have some screenshots from the game,

1127
01:49:09,260 --> 01:49:14,560
except the screenshots they have are not from the in-game mode. It is the select play mode

1128
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:22,920
screen, which, woo! I'm so, woo, I'm so excited. But what they do post in here is they post

1129
01:49:22,920 --> 01:49:29,420
a partial song list. So you look at the track list here, and I notice that L.M.K. is on

1130
01:49:29,420 --> 01:49:34,000
the track list. Now, hmm, that's interesting. And let's see, I noticed this, this I thought

1131
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:41,000
was interesting. Ace of Bass with Cruel Summer, Bad Religion with Inner Logic, Mindless Self-Indulgence,

1132
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:47,500
yeah. Mindless Self-Indulgence has a couple tracks on there. Jenny Rom. What precisely

1133
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:51,220
are you to do to these songs? There's other few ones though that these are a little bit

1134
01:49:51,220 --> 01:49:54,720
more important a beat drop with phase one beat drop would be the guy that did

1135
01:49:54,720 --> 01:50:00,580
days and destroy the remix of hysteria DM Ashura with neon rush so I mean at

1136
01:50:00,580 --> 01:50:04,100
least it got some pretty decent people

1137
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:09,260
yeah so it looks pretty good at least they've got some good musicians behind

1138
01:50:09,260 --> 01:50:13,620
it and if I remember correctly I do remember hearing this way the hell back

1139
01:50:13,620 --> 01:50:18,380
in the day because they were actually going in the Bamai style music

1140
01:50:18,380 --> 01:50:26,380
Um, production thread, and they were asking people to help them out with, um, game music and stuff, and so I know these people, like, signed on there.

1141
01:50:26,380 --> 01:50:32,380
So that's where I remember this from, at least. But, hey, you know, at least they got better people making music.

1142
01:50:32,380 --> 01:50:42,380
So, I see what they have to, you know, show first, you know, can't really go by much of this, uh, menu graphics crap, so...

1143
01:50:42,380 --> 01:50:44,380
I dunno. Watch it.

1144
01:50:44,380 --> 01:50:46,380
It's coming soon. Here's the staff.

1145
01:51:14,380 --> 01:51:25,780
that many of his stuff. Hm. It's kinda neat. We'll see. We'll see. There's really nothing

1146
01:51:25,780 --> 01:51:31,020
here for me. Yet. We'll see. I'll keep my eye on this and we'll see. That's about all

1147
01:51:31,020 --> 01:51:41,020
I can say. Don't fuck it up, guys! Alright, uh, let's see. Do they really? I totally missed

1148
01:51:41,020 --> 01:51:46,720
that. Al Mullet says Queen of Love is on there. Oh my God, they're right. Wildside with Queen

1149
01:51:46,720 --> 01:51:50,780
of Love is on there. That's awesome. That's like an English version of Bequia, although

1150
01:51:50,780 --> 01:51:54,900
it's not really because it's not actually the lyrics in English. It's just the melody.

1151
01:51:54,900 --> 01:51:59,220
But that's kind of neat. Okay, so they have a pretty decent track list so far. It's very

1152
01:51:59,220 --> 01:52:09,900
DDR Chibi-ish with a little bit of American flavor in there. We'll see. Interesting. More

1153
01:52:09,900 --> 01:52:15,960
as it develops. Skypline's open again. If you would like to send us a call, you can

1154
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:20,460
just head on over to www.orangelaungeradio.com and click on interact with us, and you can

1155
01:52:20,460 --> 01:52:24,140
call us on the Skypline. I notice not a lot of people on the Skypline tonight, so I'm

1156
01:52:24,140 --> 01:52:27,600
thinking we might not get a whole lot of calls, but it is open. If you do want to give us

1157
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:33,780
a call, again, please make sure you have the latest version. I'm going to be tallying up

1158
01:52:33,780 --> 01:52:37,460
those votes for Cagematch pretty soon. What else is in the news this week? I had another

1159
01:52:37,460 --> 01:52:44,460
Another article I wanted to talk about, and then I got sidetracked with this DTX thing.

1160
01:52:44,460 --> 01:52:49,500
Loki, how about what's going on in the sim scene? Why not? We'll get your sim update

1161
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:50,500
done.

1162
01:52:50,500 --> 01:52:57,380
What's not going on in the sim scene is more like it. Still, DDRUK is still down. Same

1163
01:52:57,380 --> 01:53:01,900
with DDR Maniacs. It's not looking good for DDR Maniacs. They've been down for months,

1164
01:53:01,900 --> 01:53:04,780
So, say goodbye to them probably.

1165
01:53:04,780 --> 01:53:07,420
Uhm, DDRUK still down for a while.

1166
01:53:07,420 --> 01:53:10,620
I'm gonna bet that they're not coming back either.

1167
01:53:10,620 --> 01:53:14,220
Uhm, and then you've got Bamai style.

1168
01:53:14,220 --> 01:53:17,300
Uhm, nothing really too much going on there.

1169
01:53:17,300 --> 01:53:22,340
Uh, pretty much the only other thing, like I mentioned last week, there's, uhm, a bunch

1170
01:53:22,340 --> 01:53:28,660
of different, like, food mix type stuff that's coming out actually.

1171
01:53:28,660 --> 01:53:32,780
a bunch of different ones that I was testing out a while back

1172
01:53:32,780 --> 01:53:34,260
like last week or so

1173
01:53:34,260 --> 01:53:35,620
that are uh...

1174
01:53:35,620 --> 01:53:41,820
in the works

1175
01:53:41,820 --> 01:53:45,220
let me see here

1176
01:53:45,220 --> 01:53:47,100
okay

1177
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:49,940
we've got

1178
01:53:49,940 --> 01:53:53,660
let me pulse up real quick here

1179
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:55,100
well we are getting a call

1180
01:53:55,100 --> 01:53:57,300
okay take that call

1181
01:53:57,300 --> 01:54:01,060
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

1182
01:54:01,060 --> 01:54:02,860
Hello?

1183
01:54:02,860 --> 01:54:06,980
Hello, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

1184
01:54:06,980 --> 01:54:10,580
Can you hear us? Ah, there we go. There you go. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

1185
01:54:10,580 --> 01:54:14,100
Who is this? This is Rai-Chan. Hi Rai-Chan, how are you?

1186
01:54:14,100 --> 01:54:18,380
It's been a while since I've called you guys. I thought I'd just call and say hi.

1187
01:54:18,380 --> 01:54:23,020
It has been a little while. Hello to you, my friend.

1188
01:54:23,020 --> 01:54:27,620
Yes, um, Joyce is sitting over here working on my katamari hat again.

1189
01:54:27,620 --> 01:54:29,620
She's doing the last little bit.

1190
01:54:29,620 --> 01:54:32,620
Hello, Joyce, as well. Hope you're doing well.

1191
01:54:32,620 --> 01:54:36,120
Yeah, he says hello, Joyce, saying he hopes you're doing well. She waves.

1192
01:54:36,120 --> 01:54:37,920
Alright, so...

1193
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:39,820
Because I've got the headphones on, so...

1194
01:54:39,820 --> 01:54:42,320
Now, you guys are making hats together?

1195
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:47,720
Yeah, well, she hasn't taught me how to crochet yet, which is the next project.

1196
01:54:47,720 --> 01:54:51,320
Teaching me how to do it. She's working on a katamari hat for me,

1197
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:53,960
and then she's going to do one for Jason too.

1198
01:54:53,960 --> 01:54:57,000
What exactly is a katamari hat?

1199
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:01,880
There was a girl that sold a hat on eBay recently for $130

1200
01:55:01,880 --> 01:55:06,160
that was a crocheted hat that was like a katamari ball.

1201
01:55:06,160 --> 01:55:11,440
It had the little bumps on it like the katamari have.

1202
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:12,440
And the little hearts.

1203
01:55:12,440 --> 01:55:15,280
I noticed on the little hat it had little hearts in the bumps.

1204
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:16,440
So cute.

1205
01:55:16,440 --> 01:55:17,200
Virgo one.

1206
01:55:17,200 --> 01:55:20,200
Mine's the one with all the hearts and the pink

1207
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:26,440
and all that sort of stuff. I don't have a really good one in my journal, but I did post

1208
01:55:26,440 --> 01:55:31,720
one in Dimashie Loving. So, if you want to see a picture of this, go to the live journal

1209
01:55:31,720 --> 01:55:36,880
and look up Dimashie Loving and there's a picture of it. Here, let me see if I can find

1210
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:41,600
that one real quick and I'll post a link in the chat room. Awesome. Chat room again over

1211
01:55:41,600 --> 01:55:46,360
at www.orangehontrader.com, click on chat. So, you're going to be learning how to crochet

1212
01:55:46,360 --> 01:55:52,280
and you'll be doing a hat as well for yourself or for, or no, the one being made now is for

1213
01:55:52,280 --> 01:55:53,280
you.

1214
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:54,600
The one being made now is for me.

1215
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:56,400
And then you're going to make one for Jason.

1216
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:59,040
Well, she's actually got one started for Jason.

1217
01:55:59,040 --> 01:56:00,040
Oh, okay.

1218
01:56:00,040 --> 01:56:03,280
But you're going to learn how to crochet because it's fun.

1219
01:56:03,280 --> 01:56:04,280
Yeah.

1220
01:56:04,280 --> 01:56:05,280
Right on, right on.

1221
01:56:05,280 --> 01:56:07,560
Well, how about, how about that DDR?

1222
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:09,320
Any DDR news you want to share?

1223
01:56:09,320 --> 01:56:13,200
Um, well I started talking to Midihead last night.

1224
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:14,200
Oh yeah?

1225
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:34,200
He was saying something, because I started a step file for House of Joy, and recently just got things set up for Maxim, and I posted in his forum about it, and he sounds really interested. He might actually do some remixes specifically for StepMania.

1226
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:39,200
Wow, that's kind of neat. That guy is so cool.

1227
01:56:39,200 --> 01:56:56,200
Minnie Head is the guy we had on the show, it was about a month ago now, it was a little while ago, it was awesome, he's a great guy and he's really, he loves this because he knows it's making him some new fans, he's made a lot of fans thanks to DDR, and that's cool, so you actually made some step files and he's cool with it, he thinks it's a neat idea, huh?

1228
01:56:56,200 --> 01:57:02,200
Yeah, he had absolutely no problem with me even sharing them around.

1229
01:57:02,200 --> 01:57:08,200
I was talking to him about maybe we can just take and put him up in the VIP area for his site.

1230
01:57:08,200 --> 01:57:12,200
He was like, no, it might be pretty cool with you just sharing them around.

1231
01:57:12,200 --> 01:57:16,200
Wow, very cool. Where can folks download this? Do you have it up on the web somewhere?

1232
01:57:16,200 --> 01:57:22,200
No, actually I don't because I recently recut the MP3 for it.

1233
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:27,200
And then I need to give it back to Jason, because he was working on the heavy steps for it.

1234
01:57:27,200 --> 01:57:31,200
Maybe once you guys are done, maybe we can work something out on orangelongstreet.com.

1235
01:57:31,200 --> 01:57:32,200
Yeah.

1236
01:57:32,200 --> 01:57:33,200
Maybe we can help you out.

1237
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:34,200
That'd be cool.

1238
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:36,200
All right, right on. Cool.

1239
01:57:36,200 --> 01:57:38,200
So, anything else you want to share?

1240
01:57:38,200 --> 01:57:40,200
No, not really.

1241
01:57:40,200 --> 01:57:46,200
I got StepMania set up for hooking it up to my TV downstairs in the basement.

1242
01:57:46,200 --> 01:57:47,200
Ah, that's fun.

1243
01:57:47,200 --> 01:57:53,200
That's because I've got Joyce started playing DDR.

1244
01:57:53,200 --> 01:57:57,200
She's only really been playing for about a month, seriously.

1245
01:57:57,200 --> 01:57:59,200
And how's she doing after a month?

1246
01:57:59,200 --> 01:58:02,200
She's actually just starting to get into heavy.

1247
01:58:02,200 --> 01:58:04,200
She can do some six foot, some seven.

1248
01:58:04,200 --> 01:58:06,200
Hmm. Not bad for a month. God.

1249
01:58:06,200 --> 01:58:09,200
After a month, I think I was graduating to threes.

1250
01:58:09,200 --> 01:58:10,200
So very nice stuff.

1251
01:58:10,200 --> 01:58:13,200
You know, she's got those Asian genes in her.

1252
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:18,120
She's half Korean, so she's got it working for her.

1253
01:58:18,120 --> 01:58:19,120
Very good.

1254
01:58:19,120 --> 01:58:20,120
Very cool.

1255
01:58:20,120 --> 01:58:21,120
Good job.

1256
01:58:21,120 --> 01:58:22,120
Hey, Jamie just got back in the room.

1257
01:58:22,120 --> 01:58:23,120
I've got to share this with Jamie.

1258
01:58:23,120 --> 01:58:27,240
Did you know that Rai Chan and her friend Joyce, they're making Katamari hats from

1259
01:58:27,240 --> 01:58:28,240
Katamari Damacy?

1260
01:58:28,240 --> 01:58:29,240
And yeah.

1261
01:58:29,240 --> 01:58:32,240
Yeah, you read the journals, so you probably know, but isn't that so cool?

1262
01:58:32,240 --> 01:58:33,240
Yeah.

1263
01:58:33,240 --> 01:58:34,240
Yeah.

1264
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:38,360
Yeah, right now, Joyce is the only one making them, so.

1265
01:58:38,360 --> 01:58:39,360
Okay.

1266
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:41,840
But your moral support, and that counts for something.

1267
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:42,840
Yes.

1268
01:58:42,840 --> 01:58:48,340
Very cool. Alright, Raichan, I'm gonna say goodbye, but thanks so much for calling in, and we hope to hear from you again sometime.

1269
01:58:48,340 --> 01:58:49,140
Yeah.

1270
01:58:49,140 --> 01:58:50,340
Alright, have a good one, buddy.

1271
01:58:50,340 --> 01:58:51,040
Alright, goodbye.

1272
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:51,540
Bye.

1273
01:58:52,740 --> 01:58:55,940
Okay, alright. Loki is gonna finish his sim file thought.

1274
01:58:55,940 --> 01:59:03,540
As I was mentioning before, there's a whole bunch of stuff for, you know, those people out there that were looking for life after FoodMix.

1275
01:59:03,540 --> 01:59:32,540
Um, starting off, um, there's a thread that was in, um, Bimani style on their DDR simulation stuff, and it's the, um, Japanese DDR fan mix watch, um, thread, and basically they have a few listed on here that you can go check out, starting with DDR XX mix, which is, um, they said they're currently testing it this week, and the song list so far, um, it's a lot of, like,

1276
01:59:32,540 --> 01:59:38,540
Like, DMS stuff. It's kind of, um, I don't know how to really describe it.

1277
01:59:38,540 --> 01:59:45,540
But, um, they've got... Let's see here. No, they kind of reverted back. It was...

1278
01:59:45,540 --> 01:59:47,540
Nothing.

1279
01:59:47,540 --> 01:59:52,540
Okay. Anyways, um, so I played it a little earlier this week. It's pretty decent.

1280
01:59:52,540 --> 01:59:56,540
They've got some decent files for that, um, with videos in the background, that kind of thing.

1281
01:59:56,540 --> 02:00:02,460
Then we have DDR D3 Mix, which is, um, they only have really one song done on it so far,

1282
02:00:02,460 --> 02:00:07,140
the song called J2-19, uh, by Cranky, which is interesting.

1283
02:00:07,140 --> 02:00:13,220
Uh, DDR E-Mix, which is all, um, anime J-pop, if you like that kind of stuff.

1284
02:00:13,220 --> 02:00:18,260
Um, then we have Strawberry Steps, which is kind of more like an event, not really a mix,

1285
02:00:18,260 --> 02:00:21,460
but, um, interesting stuff anyways.

1286
02:00:21,460 --> 02:00:28,460
There was another one I found too, something about like pop candy or something mixed, but I don't have the link for that.

1287
02:00:28,460 --> 02:00:39,460
Then there's a new theme also that's on the same thread, Stepmania Siberia style, which is basically it looks just like Techno Fiend, it's pretty cool to check it out.

1288
02:00:39,460 --> 02:00:45,460
So yeah, that was pretty much what was going on in the sim scene, not really much.

1289
02:00:45,460 --> 02:00:54,460
Of course, I mentioned last week that one bondage chick thing that was retarded, but yeah, that's everything.

1290
02:00:55,460 --> 02:00:57,460
That was someone with too much free time.

1291
02:00:58,460 --> 02:00:59,460
Agreed.

1292
02:00:59,460 --> 02:01:00,460
And he wasn't getting laid.

1293
02:01:01,460 --> 02:01:04,460
Alright, you guys want to hear who won tonight's cage match?

1294
02:01:06,460 --> 02:01:07,460
Jamie says mmm.

1295
02:01:08,460 --> 02:01:10,460
Alright, let's find out who won tonight's cage match.

1296
02:01:10,460 --> 02:01:15,460
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new champion in the cage match this week, and it is...

1297
02:01:19,460 --> 02:01:21,460
I don't fucking believe it.

1298
02:01:21,460 --> 02:01:26,460
Night of Fire by a landslide, even. By a landslide.

1299
02:01:26,460 --> 02:01:30,460
The other two songs combined did not take that one out.

1300
02:01:30,460 --> 02:01:34,460
Wow. I'm surprised, because I just sort of threw it in.

1301
02:01:34,460 --> 02:01:37,460
Well, there you have it. It's in there now. The winner...

1302
02:01:37,460 --> 02:01:48,100
Dream. Night of Fire. I need to be sick more often. Tune in next week to see if Loki makes

1303
02:01:48,100 --> 02:01:58,300
good on his promise. And maybe I'm gonna make a mean pic next week, too. We'll see. Alright.

1304
02:01:58,300 --> 02:02:02,060
Let's go to a break, boys and girls. When we come back from this break, I think it's

1305
02:02:02,060 --> 02:02:06,480
high time we got into the FUs of the week

1306
02:02:06,480 --> 02:02:10,620
because damn it we're getting angsty

1307
02:02:10,620 --> 02:02:12,840
in this break

1308
02:02:12,840 --> 02:02:17,120
I'm doing fourth mix songs because I'm playing Hypnotic Crisis

1309
02:02:17,120 --> 02:02:20,640
and if you were here with me the B4za mix because those songs are cool

1310
02:02:20,640 --> 02:02:23,800
oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, we need Saints Go Marching

1311
02:02:23,800 --> 02:02:27,600
yes we do, we're gonna do Saints Go Marching and we'll do Ninzabro

1312
02:02:27,600 --> 02:02:31,960
hell with it it's a four song break damn you we'll be back after this

1313
02:02:31,960 --> 02:02:38,960
get your fourth mix on. We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio.

1314
02:03:01,960 --> 02:03:02,960
Hey!

1315
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:03,960
Hey!

1316
02:03:03,960 --> 02:03:04,960
Hey!

1317
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:05,960
Hey!

1318
02:03:05,960 --> 02:03:06,960
Hey!

1319
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:07,960
Hey!

1320
02:03:07,960 --> 02:03:08,960
Hey!

1321
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:09,960
Hey!

1322
02:03:09,960 --> 02:03:10,960
Hey!

1323
02:03:40,960 --> 02:04:08,960
If you were here with me If you were here with me

1324
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:26,960
This ain't Sean and I am standing alone I think of you and wonder if you think of me too

1325
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:31,960
I'm back to the town that I was born in To think of my life and to start it over with you

1326
02:04:31,960 --> 02:04:37,960
Cause you know we've been in a maze of love And we are losing control to get away

1327
02:04:37,960 --> 02:04:40,960
Here I am walking on a hill in the south

1328
02:04:40,960 --> 02:04:43,960
Life in my childhood, that seems like yesterday

1329
02:04:43,960 --> 02:04:46,960
If you were here with me

1330
02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:49,960
You could feel the way I do now

1331
02:04:49,960 --> 02:04:52,960
If you were here with me

1332
02:04:52,960 --> 02:04:54,960
You could see what I am looking for now

1333
02:04:54,960 --> 02:05:11,960
Cause you know we've been in a maze of love, and we are losing control to get away.

1334
02:05:11,960 --> 02:05:17,960
Here I am walking on the hill in this town, like in my childhood that seems like yesterday.

1335
02:05:17,960 --> 02:05:23,460
If you were here with me, you could feel the way I do now

1336
02:05:23,460 --> 02:05:28,960
If you were here with me, you could see what I am looking for now

1337
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:33,760
If you were here with me

1338
02:05:58,960 --> 02:06:00,960
Oh

1339
02:06:58,960 --> 02:07:00,960
Thanks for watching!

1340
02:07:28,960 --> 02:07:56,960
I feel the heat, the vibrations on the streets No situation, it's got great complications

1341
02:07:56,960 --> 02:07:58,760
She's part of people living life

1342
02:07:58,760 --> 02:07:59,960
But it's always in the fast lane

1343
02:07:59,960 --> 02:08:01,560
Like the yellow UK, I'm the Daphne

1344
02:08:01,560 --> 02:08:02,960
I see too many blood stains

1345
02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:04,360
Too many cars with these rings

1346
02:08:04,360 --> 02:08:05,760
She's part of people seeing what's high

1347
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:07,160
I'm saving off like the sky

1348
02:08:07,160 --> 02:08:08,560
Keep it real, I'm raking lies

1349
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:10,160
And I'm part of people at five

1350
02:08:10,160 --> 02:08:11,360
This is your life, Lukey

1351
02:08:11,360 --> 02:08:13,360
Gang, listen up, and stay with the pain

1352
02:08:13,360 --> 02:08:15,360
Look at this! Yeah!

1353
02:08:33,360 --> 02:08:37,360
Gaming radio, so uncensored

1354
02:08:37,360 --> 02:08:40,360
that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

1355
02:08:40,360 --> 02:08:44,360
Uh, buch- uh, bukkake, Orange Lounge Radio.

1356
02:08:44,360 --> 02:08:46,360
Pack's done.

1357
02:08:49,360 --> 02:08:52,360
We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio. Did you miss us?

1358
02:08:52,360 --> 02:08:54,360
I hope so.

1359
02:08:54,360 --> 02:08:55,360
Sounds like their aim's improving.

1360
02:08:55,360 --> 02:08:57,360
Yeah, I know. Hopefully your aim is improving.

1361
02:08:57,360 --> 02:08:59,360
Are your allergies improving yet?

1362
02:08:59,360 --> 02:09:00,360
When I lay down.

1363
02:09:00,360 --> 02:09:02,360
Okay, well I hope you feel better.

1364
02:09:02,360 --> 02:09:08,360
It's okay, I'm just laying- um, um, actually, this- this chair is so huge that I can lay across it.

1365
02:09:08,360 --> 02:09:11,520
and I love that chair pretty comfortable

1366
02:09:11,520 --> 02:09:14,840
I wanna make love to that chair just kidding I don't I won't

1367
02:09:14,840 --> 02:09:17,800
I have to sit here not while you're laying in it anyway

1368
02:09:17,800 --> 02:09:23,480
so I'm pissed off about something I know nobody cares

1369
02:09:23,480 --> 02:09:27,440
where the fuck is Ultramix 2 song pack 8

1370
02:09:27,440 --> 02:09:31,160
what the fuck it was announced like

1371
02:09:31,160 --> 02:09:34,600
forever ago now I know

1372
02:09:34,600 --> 02:09:39,240
from what I understand Konami submitted it and it's Microsoft's fault they're

1373
02:09:39,240 --> 02:09:40,800
sitting on it or whatever

1374
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:44,820
god dammit release it already listen to these songs that are going to be an

1375
02:09:44,820 --> 02:09:46,480
Ultramix 2 song pack number 8

1376
02:09:46,480 --> 02:09:49,760
Cosmic Cowgirl love that song from D

1377
02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:53,160
do I have clips of some of these songs I hope I do

1378
02:09:53,160 --> 02:09:56,320
let me see if I got a little clip of Cowgirl or Cosmic Cowgirl

1379
02:09:56,320 --> 02:09:59,960
we all know Cowgirl I'm thinking Cosmic Cowgirl

1380
02:09:59,960 --> 02:10:06,520
this is like all the way from guitar freaks like what third mix?

1381
02:10:06,520 --> 02:10:09,520
cosmic cowgirl was like my favorite song to play on drumania

1382
02:10:09,520 --> 02:10:16,520
here it is

1383
02:10:21,600 --> 02:10:24,160
that song rocks! I want that damn song

1384
02:10:24,160 --> 02:10:29,800
and then this one I can't even pronounce but it's a fun song to play

1385
02:10:29,800 --> 02:10:36,600
Ballalakya, Carried with the Wind by Julianne Frost in song pack eight.

1386
02:10:36,600 --> 02:10:40,600
More Deep version 2.1, well we already have that one, I'm not so

1387
02:10:40,600 --> 02:10:44,080
concerned with that one. In My Eyes, the Neuromix

1388
02:10:44,080 --> 02:10:48,680
by Neuropa. That is so cool. Neuropa did like one of the coolest songs in UltraMix 2.

1389
02:10:48,680 --> 02:10:51,120
They did Standing Still in Time and they sound like Erasure.

1390
02:10:51,120 --> 02:10:54,920
I can't wait to see what they do to In My Eyes, it's gonna rock. And then Kind Lady,

1391
02:10:54,920 --> 02:10:55,960
The Interlude.

1392
02:10:55,960 --> 02:10:58,960
Notice about this song pack

1393
02:10:58,960 --> 02:11:03,260
What a lot of people were bitching about with the Konami song packs is that they

1394
02:11:03,260 --> 02:11:05,820
were recycling a lot of old garbage.

1395
02:11:05,820 --> 02:11:09,500
Only one old song in this pack

1396
02:11:09,500 --> 02:11:15,180
and really it's not even that old. It's only shown up in like

1397
02:11:15,180 --> 02:11:19,020
what, two other releases? One in Japan, one in the US on PS2?

1398
02:11:19,020 --> 02:11:22,140
So, more Deep version 2.1. Okay, you've seen it before.

1399
02:11:22,140 --> 02:11:25,940
But the other four are all new. What a deal!

1400
02:11:25,940 --> 02:11:29,940
Five bucks! Microsoft, get up off your ass, put this on the site. I want to download it.

1401
02:11:29,940 --> 02:11:33,940
It's new! Damn it!

1402
02:11:33,940 --> 02:11:37,940
What's wrong with you people?

1403
02:11:37,940 --> 02:11:41,940
I'm just really upset about this.

1404
02:11:41,940 --> 02:11:45,940
Maybe I have a little clip of the Kind Lady interlude, too. I was kind of hoping I would have one of those.

1405
02:11:45,940 --> 02:11:49,940
I don't know, though. Maybe, uh...

1406
02:11:49,940 --> 02:11:56,940
Well, I only have the... I have the Japanese v-rare at some point, but I think I moved it into a deep dark directory I'm not going to find any time soon.

1407
02:11:57,940 --> 02:12:03,940
Um... yeah. Oh well, maybe another time. It's alright.

1408
02:12:04,940 --> 02:12:09,940
I guess it's time for us to get into the FUs of the week?

1409
02:12:11,940 --> 02:12:16,940
Sound good? We don't have to. I mean, we could just, you know, end the show.

1410
02:12:16,940 --> 02:12:18,940
Promise?

1411
02:12:18,940 --> 02:12:20,940
Alright, you guys can send your FUs of the Week

1412
02:12:20,940 --> 02:12:22,940
over to Sky in the chatroom.

1413
02:12:22,940 --> 02:12:26,560
Let's start it off. Here we go, FUs of the Week.

1414
02:12:26,560 --> 02:12:28,560
Oh! I'm sorry.

1415
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:30,940
Jamie, why do we have to do the FUs every week?

1416
02:12:30,940 --> 02:12:34,000
Uh...

1417
02:12:35,640 --> 02:12:37,920
Very good. Now use your mouth.

1418
02:12:37,920 --> 02:12:39,920
Fall with the bag.

1419
02:12:39,920 --> 02:12:41,920
Here is justice.

1420
02:12:41,920 --> 02:12:43,920
Here is punishment.

1421
02:12:43,920 --> 02:12:45,920
Here is...

1422
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:51,920
Fuck you to my allergies, I hate them.

1423
02:12:51,920 --> 02:12:54,920
And my cat for sleeping on my head.

1424
02:12:54,920 --> 02:13:01,920
I hate my allergies, I'm on all kinds of drugs right now, they're not doing shit to make me feel better.

1425
02:13:01,920 --> 02:13:06,920
Also, F you to sneezing messily in my car.

1426
02:13:06,920 --> 02:13:09,920
And then to stupid drivers.

1427
02:13:09,920 --> 02:13:14,920
And then to my Photoshop teacher, because Photoshop sucks, but he's an elitist.

1428
02:13:14,920 --> 02:13:22,920
Um, F you to the seven goblins that followed my ass through the tomb in Final Fantasy 11.

1429
02:13:22,920 --> 02:13:24,920
Now you're talking.

1430
02:13:24,920 --> 02:13:27,920
Some paladin came by and owned all your asses.

1431
02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:31,920
Because you suck.

1432
02:13:31,920 --> 02:13:35,920
Um, F you to how slow leveling in that game is.

1433
02:13:35,920 --> 02:13:43,800
But it is a very blessed thing that there's not so much of the Ragnarok style newbie talk, which really sucks a whole bunch of ass

1434
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
F you to

1435
02:13:50,480 --> 02:13:55,720
Not having any real concentration other situations that I can't really do anything about

1436
02:13:55,720 --> 02:14:02,720
about. Um, F.U. to GameStop, just for the situation involving my fiance. Um, and, that's

1437
02:14:10,760 --> 02:14:17,760
really it. Alright then, let's go over to our buddy, Loki, with his F.Us of the week.

1438
02:14:17,760 --> 02:14:40,760
Fucking A, okay? First off, fucking Abit for creating a stupid motherboard with five different places to put RAM, and for confusing me for hours because I put the RAM in the wrong spot.

1439
02:14:40,760 --> 02:14:52,000
spot don't and see also basically just um looking using my crazy sleep schedule

1440
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:55,920
because I'm gonna be so tired tomorrow not that I really care because it'll be

1441
02:14:55,920 --> 02:15:04,560
fun to be getting mad at Erica sleeping for my work and lucky to my goddamn case

1442
02:15:04,560 --> 02:15:09,960
because I had to get another hard drive which I'm not even sure I need now just

1443
02:15:09,960 --> 02:15:16,440
to get the stupid thing to work with power supply. So that sucks. And that's pretty much

1444
02:15:16,440 --> 02:15:31,440
it. I had a pretty good week I think. Well then it's my turn. No they don't, they get

1445
02:15:31,440 --> 02:15:39,680
worse. I'd like to give an F you to the government for getting one of my high school friends

1446
02:15:39,680 --> 02:15:45,800
killed in Iraq. That kind of sucks. So, F you to the government. F you to Bush while

1447
02:15:45,800 --> 02:15:50,880
I'm at it, because I don't like him. I never did. And, F you to the fact that I have to

1448
02:15:50,880 --> 02:15:57,460
get up and go to work early tomorrow. That sucks. I don't like that. F you to me being

1449
02:15:57,460 --> 02:16:01,520
lazy and not getting anything accomplished, but that's my own damn fault. F you to myself.

1450
02:16:01,520 --> 02:16:03,480
and uh...

1451
02:16:03,480 --> 02:16:05,480
at the end

1452
02:16:05,480 --> 02:16:07,540
i've had a lot of it lately

1453
02:16:07,540 --> 02:16:10,100
but i hide it really good on this show

1454
02:16:10,100 --> 02:16:14,620
but secretly i'm plotting to kill each and every one of you

1455
02:16:14,620 --> 02:16:16,260
thanks for the morning welcome

1456
02:16:16,260 --> 02:16:20,300
let's see what the other folks in studio have to say starting with bug

1457
02:16:20,300 --> 02:16:23,700
yes double F you to the government

1458
02:16:23,700 --> 02:16:26,100
and uh... i've heard from various

1459
02:16:26,100 --> 02:16:33,100
people that I haven't heard it from in ten years.

1460
02:16:33,340 --> 02:16:40,340
Yeah, it was a very strange phone call today, because this person was very close to the stranger who died, and it was kind of strange.

1461
02:16:45,840 --> 02:16:49,520
F-you the diesel prices, as always.

1462
02:16:49,520 --> 02:16:53,700
Not F-you the running diesel prices.

1463
02:16:53,700 --> 02:17:00,700
we still get way good miles to the gallon so shut up

1464
02:17:00,840 --> 02:17:02,720
oh that sucked too

1465
02:17:02,720 --> 02:17:06,720
We did a memorial last week, but that still sucks.

1466
02:17:06,720 --> 02:17:07,720
I wasn't wrong.

1467
02:17:07,720 --> 02:17:08,720
That's right.

1468
02:17:08,720 --> 02:17:10,720
And, uh, let's do that.

1469
02:17:10,720 --> 02:17:11,720
Pretty good deal.

1470
02:17:11,720 --> 02:17:14,720
I need computer hard drives for my iMacs.

1471
02:17:14,720 --> 02:17:18,720
I saved a laptop by pulling a hard drive out,

1472
02:17:18,720 --> 02:17:22,720
moving files over for a UC Davis college student.

1473
02:17:22,720 --> 02:17:23,720
Putting them on my elder iMac.

1474
02:17:23,720 --> 02:17:25,720
I have the rules.

1475
02:17:25,720 --> 02:17:26,720
She was happy.

1476
02:17:26,720 --> 02:17:28,720
She had a computer that worked.

1477
02:17:28,720 --> 02:17:33,720
Okay, now I get it.

1478
02:17:33,720 --> 02:17:35,720
Yeah, yeah, there you go.

1479
02:17:35,720 --> 02:17:37,720
I don't want to.

1480
02:17:37,720 --> 02:17:38,720
Anything else?

1481
02:17:38,720 --> 02:17:39,720
Uh, not really.

1482
02:17:39,720 --> 02:17:40,720
Alright.

1483
02:17:40,720 --> 02:17:41,720
Angel!

1484
02:17:41,720 --> 02:17:48,720
A few to people who have a problem with me and won't come to me and come to my friends instead. That's all I have to say.

1485
02:17:48,720 --> 02:17:50,720
Alright.

1486
02:17:50,720 --> 02:17:52,720
And now we're going to get to the FUs from the chat room.

1487
02:17:52,720 --> 02:17:56,200
from the chat room. However, before we get to the FUs from the chat room, I would like

1488
02:17:56,200 --> 02:18:02,440
to offer a little bit of a reminder about the FUs of the Week segment here on this program.

1489
02:18:02,440 --> 02:18:14,440
Let me get my reminder music up if I could do this here. Boys and girls, we do, we here

1490
02:18:14,440 --> 02:18:20,160
at Orange Tons Radio do the FUs of the Week as a service to you and ourselves because

1491
02:18:20,160 --> 02:18:24,680
we certainly get a load off of our chest. Now, luckily, we're a small program and nobody

1492
02:18:24,680 --> 02:18:28,540
listens to us, so pretty much anybody who submits their FUs will get it read on the

1493
02:18:28,540 --> 02:18:34,240
air. One day, we will be bigger than God, and we're not going to read your FUs anymore

1494
02:18:34,240 --> 02:18:37,120
because we won't have the time. We'll have a little dark corner of the website where

1495
02:18:37,120 --> 02:18:41,720
you can post them. But for now, we read your FUs on the air. However, there are some exceptions

1496
02:18:41,720 --> 02:18:47,040
to this rule. We do not read FUs of a personal nature. In other words, if you're going to

1497
02:18:47,040 --> 02:18:51,020
rant about somebody else, we're not gonna read that F.U on the air and of course there's

1498
02:18:51,020 --> 02:18:55,180
an exception to every rule. If you're gonna rant about your teacher, we'll read that F.U

1499
02:18:55,180 --> 02:19:00,860
because your teacher doesn't like you either, fine we'll read that F.U. F.Us to your parents,

1500
02:19:00,860 --> 02:19:04,600
yeah everybody has F.Us about their parents once in a while. You know you love your parents

1501
02:19:04,600 --> 02:19:09,220
but some days you wanna kill them. Guess what? They feel the same way about you. They love

1502
02:19:09,220 --> 02:19:13,620
you most days but some days they wanna kill you. And wish you never been born. So we will

1503
02:19:13,620 --> 02:19:17,900
allowed the FUs to teachers and parents and bosses. We all hate our boss. Actually, I

1504
02:19:17,900 --> 02:19:22,220
love my boss. I'm very, I love my boss. I love people I work with. But I know a lot

1505
02:19:22,220 --> 02:19:27,780
of you work in retail, so you don't. So that's fine. You can give an FU to your boss. Those

1506
02:19:27,780 --> 02:19:33,080
types of FUs are fine. However, if you're going to give an FU to like an ex-boyfriend

1507
02:19:33,080 --> 02:19:40,100
or an ex-girlfriend or an ex-best friend or an ex-what? Ex-wife. Well, some exceptions.

1508
02:19:40,100 --> 02:19:46,120
I still let some exceptions even with that, but for the most part, if you want to give

1509
02:19:46,120 --> 02:19:54,620
an F.U. about those types of things, let me give you a phone number, 1-800-96-GERRY.

1510
02:19:54,620 --> 02:19:56,740
That is where you can go to handle your problems.

1511
02:19:56,740 --> 02:19:59,420
Please do not send them care of Orange Lounge Radio.

1512
02:19:59,420 --> 02:20:01,620
We don't want to get caught in the middle of your bullshit.

1513
02:20:01,620 --> 02:20:03,980
Thank you.

1514
02:20:03,980 --> 02:20:08,980
And now, the chat room FUs of the week.

1515
02:20:08,980 --> 02:20:15,740
Ah, let's see, VX JasonXV says, F you to Tifa, that's all.

1516

Ry Chan says, oh Joyce first, she's sending Joyce's.

1517
02:20:19,580 --> 02:20:23,460
Joyce says F you to sick demented fruit cakes that feel they can abuse animals and then

1518
02:20:23,460 --> 02:20:28,980
don't even bother taking them to a shelter and leave them to fend for themselves.

1519
02:20:28,980 --> 02:20:32,700
Ry Chan says F you to all the people at Walmart on Sunday afternoons.

1520
02:20:32,700 --> 02:20:35,900
on people there has to be something better for you to do than stand in the

1521
02:20:35,900 --> 02:20:39,860
middle of the aisle while your children run around like they're in a playground

1522
02:20:39,860 --> 02:20:45,780

02:22:12,400 --> 02:22:15,400
We feel you're angst.

1541
02:22:15,400 --> 02:22:18,400
Oh, Jamie has another one. Let me get your song.

1542
02:22:18,400 --> 02:22:20,400
No, you don't. Me too. Just to myself.

1543
02:22:20,400 --> 02:22:26,760
Okay, why why but we love you Jamie

1544
02:22:36,520 --> 02:22:38,520
When in doubt all right

1545
02:22:41,260 --> 02:22:43,260
Here here

1546
02:22:43,960 --> 02:22:45,960
Let's see a stalker I

1547
02:22:45,960 --> 02:22:49,960
I think you have a couple in our chat room. I think I think Phoenix

1548
02:22:49,960 --> 02:22:54,320
well Phoenix said he was a fanboy. I think he's more of a fanboy than a stalker.

1549
02:22:54,320 --> 02:22:57,600
You want a stalker? I do just because

1550
02:22:57,600 --> 02:23:01,320
it would be fun and interesting. Alright well. And then I could like

1551
02:23:01,320 --> 02:23:08,320
hunt them down and kill them as revenge and then get on the news.

1552
02:23:09,200 --> 02:23:13,720
Alright if you want to stalk Jamie send those emails to jamie at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

1553
02:23:13,720 --> 02:23:19,720
And did you know it'll also work for Rob at orangeslauncherider.com or Loki at orangeslauncherider.com?

1554
02:23:19,720 --> 02:23:26,720
Yeah, I agree. If anyone puts a personal F-you in again, we stick a Nevada-ton on them.

1555
02:23:29,720 --> 02:23:31,720
She can go after them with a box cutter.

1556
02:23:34,720 --> 02:23:37,720
Hey, did you know that the Dance Mania folks updated their website?

1557
02:23:37,720 --> 02:23:41,720
Dance Mania, you know, being the series that DDR got a lot of its music from in Japan.

1558
02:23:41,720 --> 02:23:50,240
Japan. They've got a new album coming out soon. It's Disco Viking. No, it's a lot of

1559
02:23:50,240 --> 02:23:54,520
really interesting old songs. Listen to some of these songs that are on the CD. Call Me

1560
02:23:54,520 --> 02:24:03,000

1561
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:08,740
Modern Girl, Heaven is a Place on Earth by Belinda Carlisle. A lot of these songs show

1562
02:24:08,740 --> 02:24:13,420
up on a lot of DanceMania albums. Belinda Carlisle. An Upside Down by Cuckoo. Okay,

1563
02:24:13,420 --> 02:24:20,980
that song is on like... Raichan is my official stalker now. Who is? Raichan. Cool. Never

1564
02:24:20,980 --> 02:24:27,420
Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley. Oh, get this. Vacation by the Go-Go's. Love that song.

1565
02:24:27,420 --> 02:24:32,380
Telephone Operator by Pete Shelley. I think that song's been in just about every other

1566
02:24:32,380 --> 02:24:46,600
The

1567
02:24:46,600 --> 02:24:55,040
Steve Miller band, Abracadabra.

1568
02:24:55,040 --> 02:24:58,540
We gotta go to a break, cause Jamie's foaming at the mouth, she wants to get into the chat

1569
02:24:58,540 --> 02:25:03,680
room, or she's gonna, she's gonna regulate, so we have to log out on the main screen so

1570
02:25:03,680 --> 02:25:04,800
we can get her in.

1571
02:25:04,800 --> 02:25:07,440
She wants to be cyber-stalked by those of you guys, so we gotta...

1572
02:25:07,440 --> 02:25:11,000
Yes, apparently we're not doing a good enough job for her in person.

1573
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:15,360
Alright, we're gonna play some Euromix songs in this break, because I wanna hear Video

1574
02:25:15,360 --> 02:25:17,120
Kill the Radio Star.

1575
02:25:17,120 --> 02:25:22,440
So we're gonna do some Euro- some varying Euromix tracks.

1576
02:25:22,440 --> 02:25:28,100
then we'll be back. Oh, and Jamie wants to hear Kids in America, so I guess we can pull

1577
02:25:28,100 --> 02:25:35,100
that song in there too. We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

1578
02:25:58,100 --> 02:26:01,100
The video killed the radio star

1579
02:26:01,100 --> 02:26:05,100
Pictures came and broke your heart

1580
02:26:09,100 --> 02:26:12,100
And now we meet in an abandoned studio

1581
02:26:12,100 --> 02:26:16,100
We hear the playback and it seems so long ago

1582
02:26:16,100 --> 02:26:20,100
And you remember the jingles used to go

1583
02:26:22,100 --> 02:26:24,100
You were the first one

1584
02:26:25,100 --> 02:26:27,100
You were the last one

1585
02:26:27,100 --> 02:26:34,100
Video killed the radio star

1586
02:26:34,100 --> 02:26:38,100
In my mind and in my car

1587
02:26:38,100 --> 02:26:42,100
We can't rewind, we've gone too far

1588
02:27:12,100 --> 02:27:33,100
I sit here alone and I wonder why, Friday night and everyone, I can feel the heat but it's soothing, heading down, I search for the beat in this steady town.

1589
02:27:33,100 --> 02:27:36,300
Steady down, down the yard with our growing

1590
02:27:36,300 --> 02:27:39,300
Down, down the yard with our growing

1591
02:27:39,300 --> 02:27:42,300
We're the kids in America

1592
02:27:42,300 --> 02:27:45,300
We're the kids in America

1593
02:27:45,300 --> 02:27:49,300
Everybody lives for the music around

1594
02:28:45,300 --> 02:29:09,300
I thought that I was wounded, yeah Just after one of these days, yeah

1595
02:29:09,300 --> 02:29:13,300
You didn't know what to do

1596
02:29:13,300 --> 02:29:16,300
Then there was you

1597
02:29:16,300 --> 02:29:20,300
And everything went so wrong tonight

1598
02:29:20,300 --> 02:29:24,300
And the story might have been a concern

1599
02:29:24,300 --> 02:29:27,300
And the music you were playing really blew my mind

1600
02:29:27,300 --> 02:29:29,300
And the love

1601
02:29:29,300 --> 02:29:31,300
It broke tight

1602
02:29:31,300 --> 02:29:35,300
Cause baby when I

1603
02:29:35,300 --> 02:29:40,300
When you fall in love for that I do

1604
02:29:40,300 --> 02:29:46,300
We warm up to be a star

1605
02:29:46,300 --> 02:29:50,300
We see and I see and I see

1606
02:29:50,300 --> 02:29:55,300
When you fall in love for that I do

1607
02:29:55,300 --> 02:30:04,300
We are one, we are one

1608
02:30:25,300 --> 02:30:28,300
Do you feel the same?

1609
02:30:38,300 --> 02:30:43,300
I want you to want me for all that I am

1610
02:30:43,300 --> 02:30:47,300
And I'll never leave you behind

1611
02:30:47,300 --> 02:30:54,300
I want you to be by my side, you're always on my mind

1612
02:30:54,300 --> 02:31:02,300
Baby, am I the only reason to stop this game?

1613
02:31:02,300 --> 02:31:06,300
Tell me, do you feel the same?

1614
02:31:06,300 --> 02:31:10,300
I want you to want me for all that I am

1615
02:31:10,300 --> 02:31:16,300
I hope that you will try to understand

1616
02:31:16,300 --> 02:31:20,300
Do you feel the same?

1617
02:31:20,300 --> 02:31:24,300
Do you feel the same?

1618
02:31:24,300 --> 02:31:28,300
Or would you have warned me for all that I am?

1619
02:31:28,300 --> 02:31:34,300
I hope that you will try to understand

1620
02:31:34,300 --> 02:31:36,300
Do you feel the same?

1621
02:31:36,300 --> 02:31:38,300
Do you feel the same?

1622
02:31:38,300 --> 02:31:40,300
Do you feel the same?

1623
02:31:40,300 --> 02:31:47,300
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and we want to get into some Ask Orange Lounge

Smiles, chat room, smiles.

1630
02:32:33,320 --> 02:32:35,120
All right.

1631
02:32:35,120 --> 02:32:39,560
But first, I want to give some plugs, we got a few plugs we want to give out.

1632
02:32:39,560 --> 02:32:43,760
As we mentioned earlier in the show, the Orange Lounge Radio Podcast, it's a downloadable

1633
02:32:43,760 --> 02:32:47,560
version of our show, about, what, 15-20 minutes?

1634
02:32:47,560 --> 02:32:48,560
Very cool.

1635
02:32:48,560 --> 02:32:50,560
No, you do not need an iPod to listen.

1636
02:32:50,560 --> 02:32:55,440
It's developed for any type of MP3 player, including your computer.

1637
02:32:55,440 --> 02:32:57,640
You can just listen to the show on your computer if you want.

1638
02:32:57,640 --> 02:33:01,640
But the really cool thing is that if you happen to have some type of portable device, the

1639
02:33:01,640 --> 02:33:05,120
show is really designed to be something that you listen to on the go.

1640
02:33:05,120 --> 02:33:08,560
So check it out, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

02:33:38,500 --> 02:33:42,020
It's really awesome and normally I don't

1647
02:33:42,020 --> 02:33:47,500

Alright, uh, let's see

1670
02:35:28,860 --> 02:35:32,100
We're gonna go into ask orange lounge hey dark night

1671
02:35:32,100 --> 02:35:37,460
Send me a private message with more information on what you're saying in chat room. I'm too lazy to type right now. This is great

1672
02:35:37,460 --> 02:35:39,460
I'm just gonna talk to the chat room

1673
02:35:40,100 --> 02:35:42,100
tonight

1674
02:35:42,100 --> 02:35:50,580
Alright, forget it. But Dark Knight, send me a private message with a link to more information

1675
02:35:50,580 --> 02:35:57,400
and I will do so. Alright, let's get into Ask Orange Lounge. This is your opportunity

1676
02:35:57,400 --> 02:36:11,580
to ask us some stuff. Let's Ask Orange Lounge. Some stupid question. What will we find out

1677
02:36:11,580 --> 02:36:18,340
this week on Orange Lounge Radio. Will we find a cure to Jamie's allergies or will we

1678
02:36:18,340 --> 02:36:31,340
find a cure for Matt's big angst? There's no cure, no cure. Question number one from

1679
02:36:31,340 --> 02:36:41,540
BRP Ohio Bamani. The podcast has potential for much more. Are you guys considering any

1680
02:36:41,540 --> 02:36:47,020
podcast-only segments? The easy answer I have to that is yes.

1681
02:36:47,020 --> 02:36:51,340
We already have a podcast-only segment. Yeah, we do have some podcast-only segments.

1682
02:36:51,340 --> 02:36:56,260
We have Dark Sakura's advice column, which is a podcast-only segment. We're hoping to

1683
02:36:56,260 --> 02:37:01,740
have more segments in the future. It's still in its infancy. I mean, what, tonight we're

1684
02:37:01,740 --> 02:37:07,000
going to do episode number five, I think? Episode five or six of the program? The show

1685
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:13,080
was still in his infancy. This show sucked when it first started too. Remember, the cage

1686
02:37:13,080 --> 02:37:16,880
match didn't show up until episode 20, and some of the segments, you know, it didn't

1687
02:37:16,880 --> 02:37:20,840
show up until later on. And now we whore them out. I mean, if we didn't have these segments,

1688
02:37:20,840 --> 02:37:25,340
we wouldn't have a show. The podcast would do the same thing. The other cool thing about

1689
02:37:25,340 --> 02:37:32,140
the podcast is that it's very flexible, is that we could, if we wanted to, if we were

1690
02:37:32,140 --> 02:37:36,820
on the road somewhere, Loki's trying to build us an on the road computer that's

1691
02:37:36,820 --> 02:37:39,900
going to be inside an Xbox. In fact, if you look on cam, you can kind of see

1692
02:37:39,900 --> 02:37:43,660
Loki's head. That's what he's working on right now. He's working on the Xbox PC. We

1693
02:37:43,660 --> 02:37:47,800
have a plan that this year from E3, we're going to be giving you updates via the

1694
02:37:47,800 --> 02:37:53,580
podcast every day on what we've seen at E3. Honestly, if you were to watch this

1695
02:37:53,580 --> 02:37:58,380
coverage on television on one of the tech stations on TV, you'd be waiting a

1696
02:37:58,380 --> 02:38:02,440
a couple weeks to a month to be seeing these sorts of updates. If you were to be reading

1697
02:38:02,440 --> 02:38:06,180
about it in a magazine, you'd be waiting like six to eight weeks to see this stuff. Even

1698
02:38:06,180 --> 02:38:14,860
other websites take a couple days sometimes. We will have live audio from E3 the same damn

1699
02:38:14,860 --> 02:38:19,240
day. It's going to rock. That's the kind of cool stuff the podcast is going to present.

1700
02:38:19,240 --> 02:38:24,440
That's what we're planning to do. So, all those sorts of things. So thank you very much.

1701
02:38:24,440 --> 02:38:32,880
hugs and kisses. Alright. Let's get to some more questions here. What else do you guys

1702
02:38:32,880 --> 02:38:40,320
think could be done with the podcast? Anything you guys want to add to that?

1703
02:38:40,320 --> 02:38:45,960
We could even do other podcasts for some of our spin-off shows.

1704
02:38:45,960 --> 02:38:50,960
Yeah, we do have that ability, honestly. So, we shall see.

1705
02:38:50,960 --> 02:38:55,960
Alright.

1706
02:38:55,960 --> 02:39:00,960
Dead air, dead air. Sorry, I'm posting a link in our chat room right now

1707
02:39:00,960 --> 02:39:05,960
on how folks can help pour us up.

1708
02:39:05,960 --> 02:39:10,960
I can make the grudge sound again.

1709
02:39:10,960 --> 02:39:11,960
That's fun.

1710
02:39:11,960 --> 02:39:12,960
What?

1711
02:39:12,960 --> 02:39:13,960
This is really creepy.

1712
02:39:13,960 --> 02:39:15,480
I said I just took apart a laptop battery.

1713
02:39:15,480 --> 02:39:16,480
That's fun.

1714
02:39:16,480 --> 02:39:17,480
Fun.

1715
02:39:17,480 --> 02:39:18,480
What's inside?

1716
02:39:18,480 --> 02:39:19,480
Batteries.

1717
02:39:19,480 --> 02:39:23,080
Scary stuff that could hurt me.

1718
02:39:23,080 --> 02:39:24,960
Legend of Zaku has a question.

1719
02:39:24,960 --> 02:39:32,160
What licensed songs would you like to see on an American 2DX mix, if it happens?

1720
02:39:32,160 --> 02:39:35,480
Any requests for an im- Shaft.

1721
02:39:35,480 --> 02:39:36,840
The theme from Shaft.

1722
02:39:36,840 --> 02:39:38,840
Jamie says Temple of Butt.

1723
02:39:38,840 --> 02:39:40,200
She's yelling from the laundry room.

1724
02:39:40,200 --> 02:39:44,640
Angel, anything you want to say?

1725
02:39:44,640 --> 02:39:46,760
I don't know, all of a sudden I

1726
02:39:46,760 --> 02:39:50,080
thought of the BT song from

1727
02:39:50,080 --> 02:39:53,640
Extreme. I don't know why, I just kind of thought of it, I don't know.

1728
02:39:53,640 --> 02:39:55,000
Simply being loved.

1729
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:58,180
Yeah, I was going to say that, but I don't know.

1730
02:39:58,180 --> 02:40:02,240
Either that or just something different, I don't know.

1731
02:40:02,240 --> 02:40:06,920
Dude, Skulk would be actually kind of fun to play. Oh my god, yes.

1732
02:40:06,920 --> 02:40:15,280
any echo image. Just honestly, team up with a different drum. Let Konami Hawaii do it.

1733
02:40:15,280 --> 02:40:21,280
And team up with a different drum. Because that would be so hot. So that and what other

1734
02:40:21,280 --> 02:40:26,160
songs would be good? Actually a lot of the crossovers they've had in DDR might be fun

1735
02:40:26,160 --> 02:40:31,000
like Dirty Vegas would be kind of cute. What else would be fun? I'm trying to think of

1736
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:35,480
songs that haven't really been in DDR yet. Or 2DX. Actually, you know what, even though

1737
02:40:35,480 --> 02:40:39,840
the song's already been in 2DX, and it's a really horrid song, I really want to see it

1738
02:40:39,840 --> 02:40:52,180
in 2DX USA, Deadline. I love Deadline. Love it. Honestly, just go to like Robin's Entertainment

1739
02:40:52,180 --> 02:40:58,360
and just put anything from those dance compilations. Just give us some Lasko, some Ian Vandal,

1740
02:40:58,360 --> 02:41:03,620
I don't care. All that stuff would be cool. I want that Come Into My Dream song by Froggy.

1741
02:41:03,620 --> 02:41:08,580
come into my address, because that has a really cool beat to it, so. Ooh, definitely, do that.

1742
02:41:08,580 --> 02:41:18,740
Do that. All right, let's see. Illusion has a question. Illusion wants to know, okay,

1743
02:41:18,740 --> 02:41:23,260
he's done a lot of soul searching here, and he's wanted to ask this question for the longest

1744
02:41:23,260 --> 02:41:29,540
time. Weeks have gone by, sleepless nights because I couldn't ask this question, he says.

1745
02:41:29,540 --> 02:41:34,540
Here is his question. Is Jem truly outrageous?

1746
02:41:34,540 --> 02:41:37,540
Truly, truly outrageous.

1747
02:41:37,540 --> 02:41:43,540
Jem is adventure. Jem is excitement. Jem is lame. Jem is not lame!

1748
02:41:43,540 --> 02:41:46,540
She is not, but the dolls have really huge heads.

1749
02:41:46,540 --> 02:41:51,540
But the Misfits? Their songs are better. And they're gonna get her.

1750
02:41:51,540 --> 02:41:56,540
It was all about later in the series when Jetta showed up and played that black saxophone.

1751
02:41:56,540 --> 02:42:03,540
phone. I was like, my hero forever.

1752
02:42:26,540 --> 02:42:31,540
They got other songs. But one of the songs they do is so cool. You've got to hear this.

1753
02:42:31,540 --> 02:42:36,540
I've got to find the directory it's in though. My computer is a big fat mess right now.

1754
02:42:36,540 --> 02:42:42,540
It is actually a cover. You're not going to believe this. It's a cover of the Gem theme song.

1755
02:42:42,540 --> 02:42:44,540
That is awesome. Play it.

1756
02:42:44,540 --> 02:42:48,120
I'm gonna play a little clip of it. Okay, I'm only gonna play like the first verse.

1757
02:42:48,120 --> 02:42:50,120
Here it is.

1758
02:43:18,120 --> 02:43:20,560
Truly truly truly outraging

1759
02:43:20,560 --> 02:43:40,460
Whoa, tramp

1760
02:43:46,400 --> 02:43:47,480
Come on

1761
02:43:47,480 --> 02:43:49,720
They're the misfits, they're gonna get her.

1762
02:43:49,720 --> 02:43:51,360
Isn't that cool?

1763
02:43:51,360 --> 02:43:53,720
Yeah, I have to tell a little story about Freeze Pop.

1764
02:43:53,720 --> 02:43:55,040
Alright, tell a story about Freeze Pop.

1765
02:43:55,040 --> 02:43:59,060
Freeze Pop is from Boston. I have a bunch of friends in Boston.

1766
02:43:59,060 --> 02:44:00,280
They were...

1767
02:44:00,280 --> 02:44:02,520
My friends were at a club, and

1768
02:44:02,520 --> 02:44:05,000
this guy was going off about how he hates

1769
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,700
and hates Freeze Pop because they sound so fake.

1770
02:44:07,700 --> 02:44:11,960
Meanwhile, the lead singer of Freeze Pop was standing behind him, just fuming.

1771
02:44:11,960 --> 02:44:14,600
Yeah.

1772
02:44:14,600 --> 02:44:16,760
And apparently she could really kick ass.

1773
02:44:16,760 --> 02:44:20,180
Did she I don't believe so freeze-pop is so awesome

1774
02:44:20,180 --> 02:44:25,900
It was pointed out that the elite singer that he really hates the sound of was standing right behind him and he I guess he left

1775
02:44:27,020 --> 02:44:31,480
Much to his own behest. Oh my god. We need to get freeze-pop on this show. I

1776
02:44:33,540 --> 02:44:38,880
Doubt that's even possible, but I would try to stick around Boston. No, I don't have to be here

1777
02:44:38,880 --> 02:44:40,880
We get we do have the phone thing

1778
02:44:40,880 --> 02:44:45,880
Yeah, see? We got Midihead on this show, dammit! Anything's possible.

1779
02:44:45,880 --> 02:44:47,880
I'll see what my contacts can do.

1780
02:44:47,880 --> 02:44:54,880
Ooh! Have your, yeah, have your people talk to their people, and then have their people contact my people. And we'll have a people party.

1781
02:44:54,880 --> 02:44:57,880
Yay people party. Or did you get the ender before?

1782
02:44:57,880 --> 02:45:00,880
Awesome. All the time. Non-stop.

1783
02:45:00,880 --> 02:45:04,880
DarkSakura, I know you're a big Gem fan, and a FreezePop fan, what'd you think of that?

1784
02:45:04,880 --> 02:45:05,880
That was pretty neat.

1785
02:45:05,880 --> 02:45:08,880
I love the Misfits part. That's like the best part of this song.

1786
02:45:08,880 --> 02:45:11,880
We are the Misfits. Our songs are better.

1787
02:45:11,880 --> 02:45:14,880
Have you heard this song? Okay, you know what?

1788
02:45:14,880 --> 02:45:17,880
I don't care. I'm going to play another little clip of a Freezepop song.

1789
02:45:17,880 --> 02:45:19,880
I don't care that we're kind of off on a tangent right now.

1790
02:45:19,880 --> 02:45:21,880
It's our show. We can do whatever we want.

1791
02:45:21,880 --> 02:45:25,880
But you have to hear this song because they talk about video games in it.

1792
02:45:25,880 --> 02:45:27,880
I'm only going to play a little clip of it.

1793
02:45:27,880 --> 02:45:31,880
But you have to listen because in the beginning they sample a Speak and Spell.

1794
02:45:31,880 --> 02:45:33,880
It is so awesome. Listen to this.

1795
02:45:33,880 --> 02:45:40,880
and it spells out freeze poop. Listen, listen, I'm not even kidding, it's awesome.

1796
02:45:40,880 --> 02:45:48,880
F-R-E-E-Z-E-P-O-O-P.

1797
02:45:48,880 --> 02:45:57,880
Wrong, try again. F-R-E-E-Z-E-P-O-P.

1798
02:45:57,880 --> 02:45:59,880
You are correct.

1799
02:46:27,880 --> 02:46:45,600
I don't have new headbands Asteroids are Donkey Kong

1800
02:46:45,600 --> 02:46:49,920
Don't look here for Tetris Even Super Wario

1801
02:46:49,920 --> 02:46:54,480
Don't ask me I told you though Don't play with me

1802
02:46:54,480 --> 02:47:00,480
I am not your choice. Oh, can't you see? I am the perfect one.

1803
02:47:00,480 --> 02:47:04,680
tell me that song is not cool pretty cool

1804
02:47:04,680 --> 02:47:09,500
I'm gonna play that song in its entirety later just you wait alright enough

1805
02:47:09,500 --> 02:47:13,180
freeze pop thank you illusion for sending me all those songs is awesome

1806
02:47:13,180 --> 02:47:20,820
let's see uh moving on right Chan and Joyce are sending this question will

1807
02:47:20,820 --> 02:47:26,860
orange lounge radio ever get a studio pet if they make ferrets legal you guys

1808
02:47:26,860 --> 02:47:32,860
I was going to say, I thought the ferrets were the pets. I was wondering where they disappeared to.

1809
02:47:32,860 --> 02:47:38,860
We haven't had the ferrets in the show in a long time. I think the ferrets got buried under crap.

1810
02:47:38,860 --> 02:47:42,860
I don't know where the ferrets are. They're around somewhere. Look around. They're somewhere.

1811
02:47:42,860 --> 02:47:46,860
There might be some next to your chair. Don't you usually have them during the show?

1812
02:47:46,860 --> 02:47:49,860
If I bend over, my nose is going to start draining again.

1813
02:47:49,860 --> 02:47:57,100
We got the ferrets around somewhere. Basically, the reason why we don't have an actual pet

1814
02:47:57,100 --> 02:48:01,420
is that, I don't know about Loki, but I am far too irresponsible to have a pet. I will

1815
02:48:01,420 --> 02:48:05,580
kill it. I'm the type of person that will come home and say, oh shit, I forgot to feed

1816
02:48:05,580 --> 02:48:06,580
a cat this week.

1817
02:48:06,580 --> 02:48:10,380
It's not about caring for the pet. It's about the $500 deposit for the pet.

1818
02:48:10,380 --> 02:48:11,380
Oh yeah, that's part of it too.

1819
02:48:11,380 --> 02:48:12,380
Fuck that.

1820
02:48:12,380 --> 02:48:13,380
Yeah.

1821
02:48:13,380 --> 02:48:16,700
There's a lot I could do with $500. Like piss it away on some computer that I won't use.

1822
02:48:16,700 --> 02:48:21,140
exactly so um... you know i just don't have the desire to get a pet

1823
02:48:21,140 --> 02:48:23,380
uh... as far as ferret and besides

1824
02:48:23,380 --> 02:48:25,020
besides like um...

1825
02:48:25,020 --> 02:48:26,360
brp said

1826
02:48:26,360 --> 02:48:29,900
they already have a studio pet, his name is loki

1827
02:48:29,900 --> 02:48:33,700
and ferrets actually smell very bad even if you do that

1828
02:48:33,700 --> 02:48:35,780
i want a penthouse pet

1829
02:48:35,780 --> 02:48:39,000
ferrets are mean little shits too seriously

1830
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:42,440
ferrets are evil because they bite things and they bite

1831
02:48:42,440 --> 02:48:43,540
through your finger

1832
02:48:43,540 --> 02:48:45,040
Only if you raise them wrong.

1833
02:48:45,040 --> 02:48:49,580
And at night, and after midnight, if you feed it, they turn into rabid little creatures

1834
02:48:49,580 --> 02:48:50,580
and...

1835
02:48:50,580 --> 02:48:51,580
Dude, no.

1836
02:48:51,580 --> 02:48:52,580
So is Loki.

1837
02:48:52,580 --> 02:48:53,580
Why do you keep him around?

1838
02:48:53,580 --> 02:48:54,580
Because he actually pays rent.

1839
02:48:54,580 --> 02:48:55,580
But that's funny.

1840
02:48:55,580 --> 02:48:57,980
We can tape him and put him on the internet, yeah, and he pays rent.

1841
02:48:57,980 --> 02:49:00,060
Would a ferret go out and get a job and pay rent?

1842
02:49:00,060 --> 02:49:01,060
I don't think so.

1843
02:49:01,060 --> 02:49:03,060
My friend's ferrets were cool.

1844
02:49:03,060 --> 02:49:07,460
He named them Koto and Poto and then he was going to give them to me before I moved out

1845
02:49:07,460 --> 02:49:08,460
here.

1846
02:49:08,460 --> 02:49:11,500
And then I found out that I couldn't have ferrets out here.

1847
02:49:11,500 --> 02:49:17,620
I would just like to add that Joyce is saying Joyce has a pair of really sweet ferrets, and she says ferrets

1848
02:49:17,620 --> 02:49:20,320
You don't because they are like a large hamster

1849
02:49:21,060 --> 02:49:23,540
Well, they're like a really small cat mixed with a hamster

1850
02:49:25,300 --> 02:49:31,140
Just what I need a giant hamster think of all the gay jokes I'd hear of with that one

1851
02:49:31,820 --> 02:49:33,820
What'd you sit on exactly?

1852
02:49:33,820 --> 02:49:46,820
I'm getting told by Joyce. Don't get me started. I know how to take care of ferrets. Do not underestimate ferrets.

1853
02:49:46,820 --> 02:49:55,820
They're illegal in California. California says no to ferrets. They will terminate the ferrets.

1854
02:49:55,820 --> 02:50:01,820
That's got to be one of the worst Arnold impressions.

1855
02:50:01,820 --> 02:50:09,260
paid to impersonate Arnold yeah what about what about that can't hear you put

1856
02:50:09,260 --> 02:50:14,700
the microphone next to your mouth we can actually hear you did you see much that

1857
02:50:14,700 --> 02:50:20,580
movie that they're doing about the governor no what about it it has this

1858
02:50:20,580 --> 02:50:25,340
old guy that doesn't look or sound like Arnold but it's supposed to be him it

1859
02:50:25,340 --> 02:50:27,340
It sucks.

1860
02:50:31,340 --> 02:50:32,340
That is all.

1861
02:50:32,340 --> 02:50:34,340
So that would be like me playing Arnold.

1862
02:50:34,340 --> 02:50:35,340
Yes.

1863
02:50:35,340 --> 02:50:37,340
California!

1864
02:50:40,340 --> 02:50:41,340
I crack me up.

1865
02:50:42,340 --> 02:50:43,340
Alright.

1866
02:50:47,340 --> 02:50:49,340
You crack you up or you're on crack?

1867
02:50:49,340 --> 02:50:50,340
Both.

1868
02:50:50,340 --> 02:50:51,340
Difference?

1869
02:50:52,340 --> 02:50:53,340
Let's see.

1870
02:50:53,340 --> 02:50:58,180
Dark Knight is sending a question, hey, quick question thinking about the Capcom and Namco

1871
02:50:58,180 --> 02:50:59,180
thing.

1872
02:50:59,180 --> 02:51:02,360
This was posted to our website, they're doing a Capcom cross Namco game, it's going to be

1873
02:51:02,360 --> 02:51:04,660
like an RPG featuring both characters.

1874
02:51:04,660 --> 02:51:10,580
I was wondering if Namco and Sega will finally do a Tekken vs Virtua Fighter game for real.

1875
02:51:10,580 --> 02:51:13,660
God I hope not because I hate Virtua Fighter.

1876
02:51:13,660 --> 02:51:20,680
Honestly we are really not the people to be asking on that subject.

1877
02:51:20,680 --> 02:51:22,980
Write letters, show love, maybe it'll happen.

1878
02:51:22,980 --> 02:51:26,980
I just want Tekken 5 to be out now.

1879
02:51:26,980 --> 02:51:27,980
On console?

1880
02:51:27,980 --> 02:51:28,980
Yes.

1881
02:51:28,980 --> 02:51:29,980
That'd be pretty hot.

1882
02:51:29,980 --> 02:51:34,980
Dan's saving a Tekken 5 poster for me to go in my cubicle.

1883
02:51:34,980 --> 02:51:37,980
When is that supposed to come out? Do we have a release?

1884
02:51:37,980 --> 02:51:38,980
I don't know.

1885
02:51:38,980 --> 02:51:40,980
Not right now.

1886
02:51:40,980 --> 02:51:45,980
I honestly don't know. That would be neat. Crossover games can be neat, but we don't know.

1887
02:51:45,980 --> 02:51:48,980
Here's a question maybe we can help with.

1888
02:51:48,980 --> 02:52:07,980
Let's see. Darkknight says, another question I need your help on. Choosing an anime character to dress up as when I go to a local convention in June. Should I dress up as a character from B-Blade, or land from Mega Man and T-Series?

1889
02:52:07,980 --> 02:52:10,980
Go with the second one.

1890
02:52:10,980 --> 02:52:14,980
I think you should dress up as a milkmaid.

1891
02:52:14,980 --> 02:52:15,980
Super milk child?

1892
02:52:15,980 --> 02:52:21,620
Yes. Go as Ranma because it's one of the only animes I've actually seen.

1893
02:52:21,620 --> 02:52:25,860
Okay. Ranma cosplay

1894
02:52:25,860 --> 02:52:30,860
should have been buried five years ago. What about Sailor Menshi?

1895
02:52:30,860 --> 02:52:36,700
That really killed everyone right there.

1896
02:52:36,700 --> 02:52:41,260
The last AX I went to though had an Utena cosplayer

1897
02:52:41,260 --> 02:52:44,620
who went as Utena in the boys uniform.

1898
02:52:44,620 --> 02:52:53,140
and it was a guy cosplaying her who looked very female but it was it was

1899
02:52:53,140 --> 02:52:56,520
really good cosplay and then he went around later in the the girl style with

1900
02:52:56,520 --> 02:53:01,740
the shorts and everything and then there was the Umi cosplayer who was a guy at

1901
02:53:01,740 --> 02:53:05,820
Fana Mae 2001

1902
02:53:06,820 --> 02:53:13,460
what's it the mob ass I don't know what I didn't I don't even know how to

1903
02:53:13,460 --> 02:53:21,020
to pronounce that. It's Dumubas. No, it's Dumas. Mr. Dumas. I love it when people make

1904
02:53:21,020 --> 02:53:27,940
typos and everybody jumps on them. Haha, you said Dumubas. Let's start internet trend now.

1905
02:53:27,940 --> 02:53:35,180
Whenever you say dumbass or type dumbass, always spell it like that. Dumubas. Just like

1906
02:53:35,180 --> 02:53:44,440
pwned you heard it here first to move ass to move ass shut up you do move ass

1907
02:53:44,440 --> 02:53:52,760
all right let's see Joyce wanted to clarify a few things about the pet

1908
02:53:52,760 --> 02:54:00,320
ferret they're tasty she's getting that is not what she's saying you sure as I'm

1909
02:54:00,320 --> 02:54:07,080
sure. It became illegal because of wrong scientific information in the 1930s that they are wild

1910
02:54:07,080 --> 02:54:11,980
animals and non-domesticated. They've been domesticated for so long that they couldn't

1911
02:54:11,980 --> 02:54:18,380
survive in the wild. The AFA is working on getting them legalized in California. But

1912
02:54:18,380 --> 02:54:23,580
in the meantime, you know what? I don't want to go to jail over a ferret. You know, I don't

1913
02:54:23,580 --> 02:54:28,100
want to be sitting next to Bubba. You're just going to slap a fine on you. What are you

1914
02:54:28,100 --> 02:54:34,320
here for? You know, I asked Bubba, Bubba, what are you in here for? I'm in here for

1915
02:54:34,320 --> 02:54:41,100
committing murder. I murdered a guy over drugs. What are you in here for, gay boy? I owned

1916
02:54:41,100 --> 02:54:46,000
a ferret. Okay, you're not going to go to jail for owning a ferret, but that would be

1917
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:52,500
funny. That would be a great sitcom. Another big guy. I'm in here for ripping the tag off

1918
02:54:52,500 --> 02:54:59,500
a pillow. It's another episode of Bubba and the Gay. Oh my god, this ferret was like tearing

1919
02:55:04,420 --> 02:55:11,180
apart my curtains. I was so mad. I just had an image of like a little Korean lady in the

1920
02:55:11,180 --> 02:55:18,180
background going, are you the gay? Are you the gay? The Korean lady can be like the warden.

1921
02:55:18,180 --> 02:55:22,540
I think it would be very funny to put

1922
02:55:22,540 --> 02:55:26,700
gay man and Bubba in the same cell. What is that accent? I don't even know what I'm doing.

1923
02:55:26,700 --> 02:55:32,700
Forget it. Korean Italian?

1924
02:55:32,700 --> 02:55:34,100
Really spicy spaghetti I guess?

1925
02:55:34,100 --> 02:55:38,900
Ry Chan says Bubba might like me though.

1926
02:55:38,900 --> 02:55:43,380
You got a purty mouth.

1927
02:55:43,380 --> 02:55:47,420
My ferret had a purty mouth.

1928
02:55:47,420 --> 02:55:50,260
Jaded2005 has a question.

1929
02:55:50,260 --> 02:55:53,580
Why doesn't someone change the webcam

1930
02:55:53,580 --> 02:55:57,220
so people don't look at the couch the whole time?

1931
02:55:57,220 --> 02:56:00,260
You need to come here more often.

1932
02:56:00,260 --> 02:56:04,820
Yes, yes I know. So people, let me finish the question. Why doesn't someone change the

1933
02:56:04,820 --> 02:56:07,980
webcam so people don't look at the couch the whole time?

1934
02:56:07,980 --> 02:56:12,380
Because it's not going to be pointed at me. Yeah, we have a ban.

1935
02:56:12,380 --> 02:56:17,380
Alright, I'll get on the fucking cam.

1936
02:56:17,380 --> 02:56:30,380
Alright, Jamie's inching her way towards the cam so that you can see something new.

1937
02:56:30,380 --> 02:56:33,380
Uh, basically, what are you doing?

1938
02:56:34,380 --> 02:56:37,380
Jamie's made her way to the c- okay, Jamie's on the cam right now, a little piece of-

1939
02:56:37,380 --> 02:56:38,380
JAMIE!

1940
02:56:38,380 --> 02:56:40,380
A little piece of Jamie, for you guys, on the cam.

1941
02:56:43,380 --> 02:56:51,380
Basically, the way the cam is set up, it's actually inside that massive arcade cabinet that Loki has set up,

1942
02:56:51,380 --> 02:56:56,380
and it's a real bitch to take the iToy out of it and put it somewhere else.

1943
02:56:56,380 --> 02:57:01,340
else. Now, there have been previous episodes. There was an episode not that long ago where

1944
02:57:01,340 --> 02:57:03,620
we actually had the IToyCam pointed over this way.

1945
02:57:03,620 --> 02:57:09,820
Well, it's not really that much of a bitch to take it. Okay. Yes, it's a huge bitch to

1946
02:57:09,820 --> 02:57:13,200
take out of the cabinet. Oh my God, the-

1947
02:57:13,200 --> 02:57:14,700
Painted in mumbass.

1948
02:57:14,700 --> 02:57:23,120
Yeah, exactly. What? Yes. Painted in mumbass. We're gonna make this catch on. You're gonna

1949
02:57:23,120 --> 02:57:24,900
like it. It's just like Death Cake.

1950
02:57:24,900 --> 02:57:31,460
The chat room has a request for you to do your grudge face on cam.

1951
02:57:31,460 --> 02:57:32,460
She's gonna do it.

1952
02:57:32,460 --> 02:57:33,460
I don't have a grudge face.

1953
02:57:33,460 --> 02:57:39,220
It's just me with my mouth open.

1954
02:57:39,220 --> 02:57:40,220
Think fish.

1955
02:57:40,220 --> 02:57:41,220
No.

1956
02:57:41,220 --> 02:57:47,060
All right, illusion as a question.

1957
02:57:47,060 --> 02:57:50,500
Since you've got ten minutes of no questions, I suppose I'll ask another.

1958
02:57:50,500 --> 02:57:51,500
Hey.

1959
02:57:51,500 --> 02:57:54,420
What's your favorite freeze pop song?

1960
02:57:54,420 --> 02:57:59,260
Obviously I'm having an orgasm over them recently.

1961
02:57:59,260 --> 02:58:01,420
Science Genius Girl remix.

1962
02:58:01,420 --> 02:58:03,020
The live one.

1963
02:58:03,020 --> 02:58:09,020
Dude, you know what Science Genius Girl remix rocks?

1964
02:58:09,020 --> 02:58:12,460
No, Loki, none of them is not the correct answer.

1965
02:58:12,460 --> 02:58:15,580
We're gonna kick you in the demub ass now.

1966
02:58:15,580 --> 02:58:18,500
Don't be such a demub ass.

1967
02:58:18,500 --> 02:58:21,700
It's the Science Genius Girl mix that sounds like it was done on a Game Boy.

1968
02:58:21,700 --> 02:58:23,700
Oh boy, listen to this, it's so cool.

1969
02:58:23,700 --> 02:58:53,140
One times two times three

1970
02:58:53,140 --> 02:58:56,140
When I clone a human being

1971
02:59:23,140 --> 02:59:25,140
Oh, boy, oh, boy.

1972
02:59:28,140 --> 02:59:35,140
Yeah, think about it this way, Dark Knight. You are on the cutting edge of a new internet trend.

1973
02:59:41,140 --> 02:59:47,140
My favorite, my favorite, uh, freeze-pop song for the record would be the, um, um...

1974
02:59:47,140 --> 02:59:50,140
Oh, God, I forgot the, I forgot the name of it.

1975
02:59:50,140 --> 02:59:52,140
What a fan I am.

1976
02:59:52,140 --> 03:00:00,140
shit meanwhile listen to Jamie just choke over there or whatever she's doing

1977
03:00:00,140 --> 03:00:04,940
what's this about stakeout that's the name of the song stakeouts my favorite

1978
03:00:04,940 --> 03:00:15,260
free swap song all right let's see I think we're about wrapping up the show

1979
03:00:15,260 --> 03:00:19,420
we're pretty much done boys and girls but we have to get everybody's final

1980
03:00:19,420 --> 03:00:28,260
thought before this show can be over. Bug, your final thought. Angel, your final thought.

1981
03:00:28,260 --> 03:00:45,060
Online games are addicting. Dark Sacra. Loki, your final thought. My final thought is I

1982
03:00:45,060 --> 03:00:48,420
I made a mess and didn't do anything.

1983
03:00:48,420 --> 03:00:52,700
Now I'm back to square one. You made a mess, now clean it up. I did clean it up, that's what I'm doing right now.

1984
03:00:52,700 --> 03:00:56,160
But uh...

1985
03:00:56,160 --> 03:00:57,200
I hate this stupid thing.

1986
03:00:57,200 --> 03:01:02,620
You know what? I could have bought a laptop for the money. I built this damn thing and it would have been more powerful too.

1987
03:01:02,620 --> 03:01:03,540
Probably.

1988
03:01:03,540 --> 03:01:05,920
Go fake. But not as leet.

1989
03:01:05,920 --> 03:01:07,860
I guess, whatever.

1990
03:01:07,860 --> 03:01:09,820
Um, let's see.

1991
03:01:09,820 --> 03:01:12,600
Um...

1992
03:01:12,600 --> 03:01:22,600
And then, um, my final thought would be, um, 1-800-96-JERRY. That's my final thought.

1993
03:01:22,600 --> 03:01:27,380
The final word of tonight's show, bugged, I'm gonna give it to you, buddy. One word

1994
03:01:27,380 --> 03:01:32,620
to sum it all up, this show. What is it, my friend? See you next week, guys.

1995
03:01:32,620 --> 03:01:35,300
DUMB-UM-ASS.

1996
03:01:35,300 --> 03:01:40,600

2004
03:03:12,220 --> 03:03:16,720
Did you know our show is being bootlegged? I just found a bootleg site.

2005
03:03:16,720 --> 03:03:21,720
Somebody's posting episodes of this show up on a bootleg page. We should sue them.

2006
03:03:21,720 --> 03:03:25,720
We're gonna sue! No, I'm just kidding, we're not gonna sue. That's kinda cool.

2007
03:03:25,720 --> 03:03:28,720
Orange House Radio's being bootlegged, that's so cool.

2008
03:03:28,720 --> 03:03:33,220
I didn't do it. I am innocent. Thank you.

2009
03:03:33,220 --> 03:03:36,500
I know you didn't do it. I know who did it! They signed their name on the page!

2010
03:03:36,500 --> 03:03:40,580
I know damn well who did it! That's alright.

2011
03:03:40,580 --> 03:03:44,540
We think it's cute. That's my official word on the matter, it's cute.

2012
03:03:44,540 --> 03:03:48,380
Alright, have a good one you guys, we'll see you next time.
