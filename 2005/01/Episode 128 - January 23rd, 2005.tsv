3838	10608	And as we wind down I-95 Our shadow's taller than our soul
22214	36845	And if you listen very hard That tune will come to you at last All for one, one for all Hey, be a rock and not to roll, roll, roll I said roll, roll

562246	566228	So... Oh, no.

582649	583150	Right.
584010	585191	Anyway, okay, that's the story.
585211	585831	Nobody cares.

977835	979476	Can you introduce yourself for our listeners?
979936	980756	I'm Miss Cleo.
981316	982897	Oh, it's great to have you on the show today.
983257	984337	Hello, how are you today?
984887	985828	I'm great, thanks.
985988	987029	Did you have a question?
987449	993373	Well, yes, actually I wanted to know... Can I please have your first name only and your birth date, please?
994473	999076	Uh, well, no, I actually just wanted to know what you thought of Orange Lounge Radio.
999336	1000217	Alright, go ahead.
1000597	1003759	Well, what do you think of Loki, one of the three hosts of Orange Lounge Radio?
1004119	1004980	Is he incarcerated?
1005692	1006973	Uh, actually, no, he's not.
1007033	1009274	But what do you think of the ever-ranty DarkSakura?
1009434	1010714	Hi, dear, how are you?
1011294	1012015	I love you.
1012255	1013755	I see you two must know each other.
1013856	1015156	Well, what do you think of Sky?
1015456	1017397	Did he used to play football when he was in high school?
1017637	1019078	Well, actually, no, he didn't.
1020298	1022159	Well, what do you think of Intern Zero?
1022599	1025981	I want you to really remember the pill, alright?
1026461	1028442	I'm seeing some forgetting, possibly.
1028742	1031663	And I'm seeing a new baby in the next three months.
1032425	1032825	Right.
1033125	1036026	Okay, well, thanks for being on Orange Lounge Radio today.
1036186	1041228	Um, I don't mean to sidetrack your question here, but who are all of these nosy people?
1041488	1044789	Outside influences I'm seeing around you by the moon card.
1044989	1045910	Get away from me.
1048431	1053252	Orange Lounge Radio, helping to free your mind and spirit.

1069107	1071288	6.30 Pacific Standard Time to 9.30 Pacific Standard Time.
1071468	1076670	All that discussion on rhythm and music, video gaming, and video games that don't suck.
1077450	1077950	And some that do.
1080111	1082732	Join us in our chat room, www.OrangeLawnTrader.com.
1082752	1083473	Click on chat.
1084373	1085994	Whatever happened to Intern Zero, by the way?
1087194	1091496	I know a whole bunch of crap about him that I'm not at liberty to speak of.
1092217	1093579	But it involves legal action.
1093779	1094840	Make up your own story.
1095861	1097062	That could be a contest, maybe.
1097102	1097843	Write your fanfic.
1097923	1098444	Okay, maybe not.
1099024	1101227	Anyway.
1102488	1112018	He was abducted by aliens and went up with Richard Dreyfuss, and then they flew away while Steven Spielberg got rich.
1113599	1114420	Yes, that's it.
1115259	1120402	Anyway, usually we start off the show playing a little bit of how was your week, how was your day, and we're going to get into that in a little bit.
1120462	1123924	However, I did want to kind of make an exception tonight for this.
1125164	1129667	Jamie and I were talking about this a little bit before tonight's show and we thought we wanted to take a minute to acknowledge this.
1130285	1156662	If you have had the television on at all today, I'm sure you've heard about this, so we're probably not the first ones to break this news to you, but Johnny Carson, you know, the late night guy that was on for many, many, many years, he passed away today, and we just wanted to take a minute to kind of offer up a moment of silence, because I don't know about you guys, but for me, I think Johnny Carson is an inspiration to any sort of talk program ever.
1156762	1158603	I mean, the guy was absolutely hilarious.
1158663	1159604	He was a comic genius.
1160409	1166173	So many people on his show, so many careers of celebrities that we know today got started all thanks to his help.
1166673	1171036	And I just want to take a minute to acknowledge Mr. Johnny Carson.
1171577	1172537	A moment of silence, please.
1177261	1178061	All right, thank you very much.
1179222	1180323	Anything you want to add to that, Jamie?
1181323	1183285	I remember that weird curtain he had.
1184445	1187888	I remember the curtain reappearing in Mallrats.
1188988	1189909	I remember Ed McMahon.
1191459	1192520	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1224904	1227765	It's very little bit cold outside, isn't it?
1229266	1231887	Excuse me for a second.
1231927	1237309	Just so you guys know what's going on, we're just... Oh, say hello, Mr. Man, who just picked up the microphone, who's getting glomped right now.
1237810	1242852	Oh, yeah, it's... Yeah, that guy called Floatwalk, and he's got something to say later.
1243592	1244673	Oh, okay, all right.
1245513	1245673	And?
1245953	1248014	And his faithful traveling companion, Sharkskrull.
1248074	1249254	Hello, Sharkskrull.
1249315	1250195	Hello, how are you?
1250215	1250315	Hello!
1251239	1252540	Hello, I have presents for you.
1252560	1254142	Thank you for making me feel special.
1254162	1260067	I gotta let DarkSakura finish her thought that she was starting with.
1274426	1279791	My week was, well, it started off really good because I started my new position at work on Tuesday.
1280431	1284434	Making more money, doing cooler stuff, and not talking to people on the phone.
1285816	1292061	And then as of Wednesday, I was single for about most of the day.
1293522	1295283	As Lynn literally dumped that day.
1296825	1297025	Yeah.
1297045	1297125	Yeah.
1298292	1300013	and things have since been repaired.
1301754	1310558	Although it's been a very, very, I'm not, of course, it's nobody's real business what happened, but I've been very much on edge for this entire week.
1311799	1315100	And today has been the first good day of my entire week.
1320243	1320543	It's just,
1324794	1325754	I'm not really going to go into it.
1325794	1326975	It was really, really hard.
1328335	1328795	It's personal.
1328835	1329195	That's fine.
1329835	1337177	Yeah, but that's really been the entire focus of my week, although I've played a whole crapload of Castlevania today.
1339038	1339378	Which one?
1339818	1340498	Symphony of the Night.
1340818	1341118	Right on.
1342778	1349640	And I had two class orientations, spent $118 on art supplies, and I still need to buy another 60 more.
1350440	1351020	Jeez.
1351400	1352461	What kind of class is this for?
1353321	1353381	Uh,
1353999	1355020	Concept of art design.
1357763	1361487	So, I have to buy paint next, like watercolors and crap.
1363088	1367232	So, that's really it for this week.
1368073	1369214	So that's why I'm full of angst.
1369935	1370616	Okay, well.
1370656	1374820	However, I have rediscovered the joys of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches made with pineapple jelly.
1375706	1376727	I figured you'd like the picture.
1399781	1400762	I rejoined that too.
1424884	1426104	Oh yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh.
1426445	1426785	Addict!
1427105	1427425	Addict!
1428045	1428866	Oh, you're not an addict.
1428986	1429546	Oh yeah, sure.
1429606	1430846	We'll cover that later.
1431246	1432127	I'm not an addict.
1432907	1443231	Anyways, then I was working on the Orange Box at the moment, and for those who don't know what the Orange Box is, that's the Xbox case that's going to have a PC in it.
1444271	1451514	And I spent lots of time dremeling today, and now the case is, you know, kind of a,
1452814	1455135	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1477240	1478520	That will be replacing it.
1478880	1486602	And I don't know why I need a 160 gig hard drive considering that this... I don't really know what the hell I'm going to put on it.
1486722	1487122	ROMs.
1487362	1489622	But I don't think I can fit 160 gigs of ROMs.
1489662	1490542	That's a lot.
1492743	1494723	And then... What else?
1494863	1494963	Oh!
1495683	1498764	Other than that, I had a migraine yesterday and that was lots of fun.
1499144	1504165	And then... No, that's pretty much it.
1506185	1506345	Yeah.
1508826	1513288	No, I did not plan how to rape Robin in the sleep, but there was a sketch... What?
1514568	1514828	What?
1515128	1518450	But Nellie said she would try for $100, but she... $50.
1519450	1532235	I need to ask, because I was sitting here the other night, we were all sitting around, and Nellie, who is Loki's other half, was just coming up with all these random hypothetical questions, and they all had to do with raping me.
1535359	1538080	Hey, we're going to get that kid named Jagermeister eventually.
1540901	1542162	Would you rape him in a boat?
1542242	1543563	Would you rape him on a float?
1543683	1545123	Would you rape him near or far?
1545183	1546304	Would you rape him in a car?
1547444	1551886	But it would be really easy to rape you in your sleep because you sleep a lot on the couch on your back.
1552687	1560530	And since 70% of male sleep is spent with an erection, I was thinking I'd just sneak up on him and pull his pants down.
1561070	1564192	And insertion equals rape, so that's like an easy 50 bucks.
1565856	1568378	Yeah, but the minute you sit on me, I'm going to go, Ah!
1569279	1571220	It's in already, so it doesn't matter.
1572081	1572922	Oh my God.
1574143	1575284	You're a sick woman.
1575304	1580548	You're going to steal my... This is the first time we've gotten Nellie to really talk on this show, and it's about raping me.
1583551	1584651	That's what I do best.
1585232	1589876	Then she's sitting around trying to get Loki, Would you rape Rob for a million dollars?
1591017	1593759	Would you rape Rob for a hundred thousand dollars?
1595370	1596651	Would you rape him for 20 bucks?
1597052	1597552	And a smile.
1597572	1599494	I love her.
1599554	1601156	Would you rape Rob for a Klondike bar?
1603899	1605480	Ooh, Klondike bar.
1606201	1609264	I love Klondike bars, but no, no, no.

1619850	1622731	about me for a question for Loki here.
1622971	1624351	Would you rape him in the face?
1624591	1625792	Would you rape him anyplace?
1630313	1632734	Somewhere, Dr. Seuss is crying.
1632834	1634435	But I offered to split the money with you.
1635655	1636015	Oh, gee.
1636035	1639476	That's why it's $100, because I was going to give $50 to you.
1639516	1639716	No.
1640857	1641237	Never mind.
1641297	1643817	I was going to get technical and ask, technically, what is rape?
1643837	1644978	Does oral sex count as rape?
1645098	1645258	No.
1646038	1646298	All right.
1647879	1648899	Anyway, move on.
1649511	1652374	Moving on to non-raping subjects, at least I hope.
1652894	1653875	Mel B, how was your week?
1653915	1654495	How was your day?
1655536	1656257	Oh, dear.
1656957	1661421	Week was a lot of monotony, but then again, when you're working in video games, you wait.
1661461	1662742	That's really how it goes.
1663383	1666906	For those who may or may not know, I actually did not work at Konami at the time.
1670229	1671450	Okay, just reading these lines.
1671490	1671830	I'm sorry.
1671990	1673772	Chat room, stop being funny.
1674132	1674492	Stop.
1675694	1677375	Stop being... Okay, I'll say it.
1678130	1682672	For those that are not into chat, Blaze, the comic genius of Blaze again.
1682992	1684412	Can you rape him in the ear?
1684552	1685813	Would you rape him for a beer?
1689554	1690894	Would you rape him like a duck?
1691015	1692095	Would anyone give a fuck?
1692955	1694496	Would you rape him for five bucks?
1694556	1695496	Would you rape him like a duck?
1696116	1697117	Oh, jeez, forget it.
1697317	1698377	Chat room, stop being funny.
1698637	1698957	Stop.
1699718	1700078	Stop.
1701698	1702058	Sorry, Mel.
1702579	1706620	Yeah, I'm actually, instead of being at Konami right now, I'm actually working at Namco.
1707276	1714899	of all places, which means it's a lot of Pac-Man and Pac-Man and Tekken 5.
1716179	1718180	But it's just kind of going along.
1718220	1718620	It's a job.
1718640	1720681	Everything is kind of interesting.
1721021	1727944	And of course, as with any place I go to, there's that one person who watches me play either DDO or 2DX at work.
1728004	1730965	I usually bring my stuff on break and play user debug stations.
1731065	1731145	And
1732043	1734284	They say, wow, did you work at Konami or test this game?
1734324	1737225	Like, I didn't test this game, but, you know, I played before and stuff.
1737465	1738846	Like, wow, you must feel like DDR, too.
1738866	1740907	I'm like, yeah, I played, you know, I played DDR for a couple years.
1740927	1743888	And he goes, wait a minute, weren't you at that first Metreon tournament?
1743928	1744749	I'm like, yeah.
1744969	1746009	Wait a minute, what's your name again?
1746489	1746970	Uh, Mel.
1747290	1750151	They're like, no way, you're not Mel B. I'm like, yeah.
1750471	1751812	Like, dude, let me see your name badge.
1751992	1754113	I'm like, this is at work?
1754553	1755273	This is at work.
1756114	1761496	Here, guys, like, other testers come up to me and, like, know me through this stuff and... Don't you...
1762176	1764538	You don't have time to be fraternizing on your breaks.
1764678	1768681	Isn't there a new Katamari Damacy game to be testing and Tekken 5 and all that stuff?
1769002	1770443	That'll be later this year.
1771784	1772364	How it goes.
1772845	1776047	But yeah, we have all sorts of goodies over there right now.
1776087	1778269	We get to see a lot of PSP action out there, actually.
1778429	1779130	Ooh, very hot.
1779370	1781992	Yeah, so those things look pretty sexy, I must say.
1782092	1783613	They look a lot better than what I remember at E3.
1783633	1784894	I remember that much.
1785835	1787957	Is Namco going to be putting anything out on the DS?
1788677	1790419	Because damn, the DS needs some games.
1791159	1791620	Yes, there is.
1792298	1793519	Oh, yeah, the Pac-Pix thing.
1793919	1794159	Of course.
1794359	1797140	Namco has to whore Pac-Man wherever they can.
1797781	1798101	Mm-hmm.
1798501	1812107	I mean, yeah, basically, the two main sounds you hear out of Namco are waka-waka and... Seriously, that's just what I feel like when I walk around the whole... When you walk around the Namco building, do you actually do a... Do they have dots on the floor?
1818447	1825793	I think in one of the old rooms, because they just moved buildings, but at the old building, yes, there was a room that actually had, like, a Pac-Man mic.
1826154	1829737	Now, at Namco, can you have drag days, and you just all come to work with a bow in your hair?
1832339	1837904	Oh, man, they just instituted a dress code out there, so we can't even, like, you know, come in our normal does.
1837924	1840806	We gotta have, like, collared shirts, and we gotta be all prim and proper.
1841567	1845190	I would, so, if I worked at Namco, thank God I don't, because they couldn't handle me.
1845558	1850321	But if I were Dinamco, man, I'd come to work with a bow in my hair one day and be all, yes, I miss Roberts.
1854304	1855004	Forget it.
1855385	1857386	So, yeah, just getting used to the new gig.
1857486	1858467	It's, you know, pretty cool.
1858807	1863830	Although, you know, after playing a fighting game for eight hours straight, it can be tiresome.
1864010	1869194	Or, you know, when they do something genius like have me play a two-player mode all by myself for eight hours.
1869314	1871115	Yeah, I was reading about that in the LJ.
1871175	1871856	What's up with that?
1871876	1873617	I don't know, man.
1873717	1874978	They're just geniuses out there.
1874998	1875418	What can I say?
1875945	1883767	Now, I've played two-player versus in fighting games by myself before, but that was, like, to see all the fatalities in Mortal Kombat, okay?
1883847	1884067	Right.
1884187	1887227	I mean, if I want to do something like that, just put me on practice mode.
1887267	1890488	At least there's some kind of, you know, indicator of what you're doing in there.
1890508	1895689	You can actually, like, practice stuff in practice mode, but if you play versus, it's kind of pointless.
1896869	1898430	But, yeah, for that.
1898450	1900550	And then the weekend's been pretty, you know, chill.
1900570	1904331	I mean, yesterday was a pretty horrible day because I was going to go to work,
1905323	1907124	I wake up and I realize I can't find my car keys.
1907164	1909005	I'm like, hmm, what could be going on?
1909565	1910986	And so I'm just kind of worried.
1911006	1913167	So I start turning my place upside down and I don't find it.
1913667	1916188	And I couldn't find my phone because it was locked in my car.
1916688	1921610	And so, you know, my phone was in my car and I didn't have my car keys.
1922031	1923411	And so I'm just like really tripping.
1923511	1927433	And then, so I don't know how to, you know, contact anyone or anything.
1927553	1931675	And it's like, first I didn't want to, you know, tell anyone.
1932536	1936118	Sharks girl over here because she knows I'm like the most forgetful person in the world.
1936438	1940159	Last thing I needed was more, you know, fuel for her fire and etc.
1940660	1945742	And then it kind of got to the point where I just kind of said, okay, screw it.
1945762	1949083	I'm just going to call mobile locksmith and yeah, I'm just going to bite the bullet, etc.
1949563	1951284	And so what happens is I called a locksmith and
1952094	1979405	he comes on over and he pops my door open and it was going to cost about like damn near 300 bucks to get a new key because I have like a computer chip in my key that's you know certain to the Camaro series of that year and right when he pops my door open my cell phone goes off and it starts going and she calls me and says hey I just found your keys right now in my handbag I'm like no way so it was all about impeccable timing that night but I was on edge pretty much that rest of the day and
1980239	1986043	Everything else has been pretty chill and today's been just coming up here and of course Orange Lounge is where I be.
1987564	1989565	Alright, and Pixie?
1993547	2002953	Well, to say the least, I spent the majority of my week on vacation in Hayward doing butt-ass nothing, driving a truck all day long.
2004134	2009177	And, let's see, came back on Thursday night in like dense-ass fog.
2010697	2011157	What else do we do?
2011658	2012378	What else do we do?
2014120	2015461	Stop bringing goddamn books!
2016502	2016902	Bitch!
2018783	2020024	Now he won't talk to me.
2020044	2020925	But anyways, yeah.
2021025	2021646	Is that the new one?
2023287	2023867	Is that the new one?
2024107	2026169	Like the one with the Chains of Prometheus stuff in it?
2027490	2028311	I'm sorry.
2028891	2029552	No, I had that one.
2029612	2029912	Never mind.
2030172	2031033	Okay, anyways, continue.
2032834	2034295	And, let's see, Saturday.
2034315	2037358	I mean, I've been boring.
2037378	2038839	I haven't been here very often.
2039622	2040423	Alright Frank, give it to Victor.
2047248	2048168	I'm right here.
2049730	2054693	Buy me a bottle of Jager and give me five bucks in five minutes.
2057235	2059016	Well, Rob, you can open your gift now.
2059457	2061418	This was Angel's idea to get this.
2061758	2062379	Yes it was.
2062739	2067182	So I could redeem myself because I flaked twice on you when I said I was going to come by.
2067763	2069204	But you have to read the card first.
2071926	2072867	I love GIFs.
2073007	2073707	This is great.
2073787	2076488	I think every week should be Bring Sky GIFs Week on Orange Lounge.
2076709	2078870	Next week will be Bring Sky GIFs Day.
2079010	2082191	I was like, it wasn't my... Yeah, it was her idea.
2082291	2083072	She spotted it.
2083372	2083872	Okay, fine.
2083892	2086674	Where's the card?
2086714	2087514	Where's the card?
2087934	2089335	Well, go through the double wrap.
2090356	2092757	The double ghetto wrap that I call Winko Plastic Bag.
2092777	2093677	I love present time.
2094758	2095879	Aw, it's kisses.
2095979	2097239	It has a little pig on it.
2097259	2098360	It says, kiss you.
2100572	2101593	Make me squeal.
2101753	2105236	And then it says inside, it says, Will you marry me?
2107057	2108458	Janae just proposed to me.
2109119	2109379	Yes.
2109519	2110900	Yes, bitch, I'll marry you.
2110920	2114143	Well, your ring's in the bag, too.
2114243	2116144	Yeah, your ring's in the bag.
2116164	2117265	Your ring's in the bag, too.
2119947	2120748	What the shit?
2124091	2124231	It's...
2125231	2127454	It's a rainbow dessert parfait.
2127975	2128335	Get it?
2128556	2129897	Because I'm a big fag?
2130378	2131219	It's rainbow?
2134564	2136226	I'll go put this on cam.
2138529	2139871	And it's shaped like a hole.
2143490	2144731	A bag of mayonnaise.
2146532	2147873	What the fuck, lady?
2149614	2151415	I didn't mean it with a bag of mayonnaise.
2151435	2157639	That was for my sandwich.
2157739	2159040	I will remember this forever.
2159380	2168466	I'm going to go with my mom and say, Mama, I got proposed to with a bag of mayonnaise and a Froot Loop.
2171118	2173799	I thought $2 would be enough to spend on you, you know?
2179482	2182043	Other than Frozen and Rob, that's been my week.
2183384	2183744	Victor?
2184965	2187166	Alright, my week, or the week before, which was more exciting.
2187226	2187806	Actually, just kidding.
2187846	2189667	This week was fun with my girlfriend.
2189687	2190828	We had a lot of sex!
2191328	2192749	No, we had no sex.
2192769	2194529	What the hell is that tuna smell?
2196590	2198171	Sorry, I had a sandwich in there.
2198691	2199692	Oh, ugh.
2201035	2205916	Well, anyways, playing Final Fantasy Online and Rank 6.
2207617	2210917	Have a whole bunch of plus one gear and leaping lizards and all that crap.
2211918	2216739	Other than that, this week with my girlfriend was exciting.
2217399	2217879	I loved it.
2218679	2219099	And that was it.
2220940	2221120	Aww.
2221640	2225621	Oh, by the way, you can double the ring mold as something to put your dick in.
2227721	2228422	Oh, my God.
2232725	2232965	You.
2240008	2241108	It's safe sex.
2243609	2245710	That mayonnaise does not have a spermicide in it.
2249871	2251032	I like the new microphones.
2251512	2253853	Oh, I can't wait to go fuck my new rainbow pussy.
2253893	2254793	I'm so excited.
2258515	2258855	Bitch.
2261773	2262914	I love you!
2264815	2268458	We're just too hardcore for G4 TV, that's why we'd never be on there.
2272560	2273201	Okay, anyways.
2274862	2278845	Our chat room is so lost right now because they're not getting half these references, but that's alright.
2279685	2281566	NoStylin, were you done talking about your week and your day?
2283748	2284208	I'm rank 6.
2284428	2285829	Are you waving your hand in the air?
2286109	2287430	Waving it like you just don't care?
2288831	2291393	You might get those girls parapairing.
2293366	2294726	You got ranked 6th on Final Fantasy.
2294746	2296407	I'm so proud of you.
2296447	2297947	Your internet penis is huge!
2300048	2302269	I have 90 days playing Acquired.
2302349	2304050	I have wasted my life.
2304410	2304770	Jamie?
2306511	2306931	If you would.
2307411	2307691	Addict?
2310832	2312373	You know what?
2313233	2317195	I plan on addicting myself because Ragnarok Online 2 is not yet out.
2318194	2322655	and I need something to play because I miss Ragnarok so much but I'm so pissed off at Gravity right now.
2323716	2329858	I actually spent a whole ten minutes on Final Fantasy XI yesterday waiting on Rob.
2333499	2333819	Alright.
2337740	2338480	Shark Skrull.
2339540	2342761	I'm sorry, I had to revel in the moment there about Jamie actually playing Final Fantasy XI.
2342801	2343902	I had to think about it for a minute.
2345422	2346242	Okay, you're done now.
2346322	2346963	Alright, Shark Skrull.
2347143	2347583	How was your week?
2347603	2347983	How was your day?
2348393	2349053	That'd be awesome.
2377199	2384781	that would be kind of a different change I forgot to mention I had big news my job well
2386109	2411746	technically it's not been announced yet but since no one really listens to the station anyways of any importance I thought I would go ahead and mention it well our company has decided to get back into the games business so now they're going to be doing game distribution and I've been told by the CEO and by my boss that I'll be a part of it somehow but you have to rape them I do not have to rape them
2416801	2418142	Rape them at a medium pace.
2419923	2421344	You have to rape them at the mall.
2421404	2422545	Then you have to rape them all.
2423506	2423786	Sorry.
2423806	2426748	Why do you rape them for a PSP?
2426808	2432552	It's like this slogan they used to have for the mall back in Mobile.
2432973	2435574	It was, you know, shop the mall, shop them all.
2436315	2438116	It's rape the mall, rape them all.
2438997	2440358	Gotta rape them all.
2443180	2444040	So anyways...
2445649	2447250	Yeah, remember that word, piss?
2447350	2449071	How funny that was last week?
2449512	2449952	Yeah.
2452093	2463721	No, so anyways, games... We're going to be getting in the games business, so that means I can get an E3 using VPD now, and also hopefully get some free demos.
2464942	2465682	Yay, demos!
2468304	2471606	SharkStroll, were you done with your thought before Loki so rudely interrupted you?
2472587	2474148	I'm boring this week, so...
2480821	2486725	I interviewed for the job I'm at now on Monday on the phone.
2486825	2488807	I interviewed in person on Wednesday at 9.
2488907	2491789	I found out I had the job at 1 and got in a car accident at 1.20.
2492149	2498654	You have this insane luck with car accidents when you do new exciting things.
2498674	2501636	$1,584 to fix a bumper and a back quarter panel.
2502136	2503077	That's crap.
2503657	2504658	That sucks.
2505354	2507595	Luckily, my insurance covered all but $250 of it.
2508215	2508795	That's decent.
2509115	2517978	And I might get $125 back if I can convince Geico that because I'm backing out doesn't mean that I have a greater duty of care to watch that I don't hit him considering he was backing out too.
2519119	2519939	I don't get that one.
2520339	2521840	Why it's more my fault, but okay.
2523340	2524320	Because you're a woman.
2524340	2524921	What, Nellie?
2524981	2525901	Because you're a woman.
2527762	2530463	Which proves the point that women can't drive.
2531323	2531803	Stop.
2532427	2535908	I have some really nice videotapes I could throw at your head right now.
2535968	2538309	They're nice and heavy.
2538970	2539170	That's hot.
2539190	2539590	Flavor Flav!
2539630	2539910	Flavor Flav!
2558035	2566881	Flava Flav, and Dave Coulee, and Brigitte Nielsen, and Charo, and Brian Starr.
2567561	2570083	Oh, and Jordan Knight.
2570583	2570963	Whatever.
2571544	2572004	What else is there?
2572084	2575326	Oh, so you've been doing nothing but playing on your sidekick at work this week.
2575346	2575706	Yeah, pretty much.
2576107	2577367	Does Snoop do his own laundry?
2577888	2578048	Huh?
2578268	2579549	Does Snoop do his own laundry?
2580489	2581030	Yeah.
2583051	2583311	All right.
2583391	2584152	Did you have a comment?
2584672	2585873	Or are you just waving at the camera?
2585993	2586473	No styling?
2586493	2587514	All right.
2587987	2593350	If you want to see the webcam, www.orangeonstrider.com Moving on, it's my turn, dammit!
2594151	2596152	I want to take a turn, I know we still got Angel left to go.
2596212	2596893	Come on, bitch!
2597433	2599754	I've got something to say!
2599894	2600955	I've got something to say!
2601115	2603957	My boyfriend's retarded, so don't look at him on the camera, please.
2604337	2605158	Don't encourage him.
2606058	2609861	Anyway, my week and my day was okay.
2610061	2612542	I did a whole lot of nothing this week, really.
2612562	2615004	I played a lot of Final Fantasy XI, just like, you know, my...
2615970	2617711	Thank you for watching!
2633412	2635595	and you guys know what a freaking lightweight I am.
2635635	2637518	You've heard the drunk shows we've done on Orange Islands Radio.
2637718	2642825	I don't know how I was able to hold down that many shots without completely passing.
2642885	2647911	I did eventually pass out, but I was quite proud of myself considering I hadn't drank in a long time.
2648012	2648953	Yes, Pixie Dust.
2650123	2655467	Okay, did you pass out and they put a funnel in your mouth and then they shot the shot down for you?
2655747	2659190	No, I kept going... You were always falling asleep on the floor.
2659210	2661971	I fell asleep on the floor like three times in my house.
2662052	2663753	Everybody was doing shots together.
2663913	2666575	I was just the biggest pussy with the lowest alcohol tolerance.
2667295	2668916	And so everybody else was still coherent.
2668936	2673640	But then I'd be kind of like slumping on the table going, I need to cut myself off.
2673900	2677142	And then they'll put another one in front of me and I'll be all, okay, drink it.
2677222	2677523	Okay.
2686983	2691166	No, thankfully Pixie Dust was not at the party, so nobody was putting makeup on me and making me look pretty.
2691366	2697610	At least you weren't like Verne Troyer in the first episode of Surreal Life Season 4, because he was naked and pissing in the corner of the weight room.
2697730	2706937	I was, however, going, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.
2709238	2711780	Alright, enough talking about VH1 shows.
2713066	2718070	Look at that, they're sitting there in the chat room right now, and one of my buddies that was there last night says, yeah, we shaved his ass.
2720151	2720452	Huh.
2721012	2721492	Interesting.
2721613	2722894	Did I check it this morning?
2724795	2726616	You want to come inspect it, Pacey Dust?
2727497	2729238	Get the flashlight, it's pretty cavernous.
2729619	2729899	Alright.
2731280	2733282	DDR Angel, last but certainly not least.
2733302	2734142	How was your week, how was your day?
2735403	2736084	Well, let's see.
2736524	2742909	Classes started this week, and normally I'd probably be going, uh, but
2743729	2747852	No, actually, scarily enough, I enjoyed myself this week.
2748533	2749514	That's a little scary.
2749594	2751075	School being enjoyable.
2752075	2753497	Okay, anyway.
2754497	2764365	Um, yeah, other than that, uh, just like everyone else, Final Fantasy XI, Jamie, waiting, waiting, waiting.
2766141	2767102	I'm not going to say it anymore.
2767362	2769423	Okay.
2769803	2773625	And actually, I actually split myself between three games now.
2773826	2779949	So it's now Final Fantasy XI there, and I've gotten back into Myst.
2780269	2780670	Help.
2782050	2783071	Ah, Myst.
2783511	2785372	Nobody cares about that in this area.
2785813	2788134	Isn't Myst like 15 years old, that game?
2788194	2789615	It's older than God.
2790069	2797312	Of course, but I had to start... I'm not going to comment that I have it for Saturn.
2798372	2799272	Cool.
2800293	2817338	Yeah, I never got to really get to play that game, so they came out with a DVD version a little while back, so I have all three of those, the first three in the series, and then I got the Complete Chronicles, which is like a little offshoot of the...
2820106	2825889	So, I have too many games to play and school to deal with.
2827750	2828190	That's okay.
2828350	2829311	Final Fantasy XI tomorrow.
2829451	2829671	Yeah.
2830731	2831151	Or tonight.
2831572	2832552	I beat it last week.
2834433	2835534	You can't beat Final Fantasy XI.
2835574	2836094	Yes, you can.
2836114	2837394	The original Final Fantasy XI.
2837414	2838475	You can beat the storyline.
2838515	2839435	I played the storyline.
2839475	2840216	Oh, okay, okay.
2840276	2840756	That was fun.
2841597	2841977	I gotcha.
2846719	2847159	Moving on.
2847179	2848140	They can't hear you, dear.
2848160	2848680	They can't hear you.
2849352	2852934	I spent it laying on the bed watching my boyfriend play Final Fantasy XI.
2853194	2855175	How depressing is that?
2857497	2858757	For my vacation.
2858857	2859918	Were you at least giving him head?
2859938	2863880	The majority of my vacation was sucked into Final Fantasy XI.
2864180	2865581	Were you giving him head while he was doing it?
2866021	2867122	Nah, the table's too small.
2867222	2868443	Oh, whoa, hey.
2868483	2869143	Ho, ho, ho.
2869183	2869704	Hello.
2869724	2869984	Hello.
2870064	2870384	Alright.
2870504	2870924	Alright.
2871104	2871304	Wow.
2871365	2871625	Wow.
2878235	2880777	Moving on, we're going to go to a break, I think.
2880897	2888583	And in this break, now when we were in that last break there, the chat room was starting to go, you guys play these songs all the time.
2888683	2891525	Can't you play some songs we don't ever hear?
2891805	2892886	What's wrong with you guys?
2893046	2894047	Play some new songs.
2894508	2894748	Fine.
2895128	2903034	So I'm digging into the obscure stuff, the stuff we don't really play a whole lot, and I'm going to try and play some new stuff that we don't play on Orange Launch Radio a whole lot.
2904744	2906905	Okay, but see, we play that one a bit.
2907366	2911708	I can do that in a later break, but I gotta do stuff that jumps out at me saying we don't really play this.
2911728	2914250	Dig into the bowels of 2DX Substream.
2914650	2922315	I'm gonna dig into the bowels here, but what I have queued up right now, I have the bonus stage from the newest Taiko no Tatooine in Japan.
2922375	2924956	Now, I know we've never played that one, because Navi just sent it to me this week.
2925376	2925857	It's called...
2926437	2952510	Koi Bumi 2000, we're going to play that and then we have from 2DX Red, I know a lot of folks have heard this but we haven't played this song on Orange Lounge Radio and it has the word fuck in it, so I have to play it, so listen carefully but it goes, you have to listen carefully because it goes, fuck me and it's called Injection of Love and then we're going to play something, I'm going to play some like old ass 5 key song as well so we will be back after this
2953203	2957772	with some rare music stuff, and we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio after this.
2977743	2978184	DarkSakura
2994284	2995365	Thank you for watching!
3039364	3040428	Thanks for watching!
3116301	3117462	Thank you for watching!
3166677	3167326	DarkSakura
3211858	3213278	Thanks for watching!
3272907	3283573	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio and oh my lord, there's a gazillion people in the house now.
3293729	3302731	I think somewhere during that break, Explicit showed up, and RicePrincess and LankyStyle from Thursday Nights Outside the Box showed up as well.
3303391	3305291	Holy crap, there's a lot of people here.
3305931	3310012	So I guess we might as well continue with the how was your week, how was your day bit real fast for the people that just got here.
3312233	3313513	LankyStyle, how was your week, how was your day?
3314813	3319414	Same as always, just work, slaved over the phone, working for the devil.
3321075	3321575	I hear that.
3321835	3323556	Rice Princess, how was your week, how was your day?
3324896	3325797	She just said pretty good.
3327898	3328378	Explicit?
3331239	3331939	It's pretty good.
3332519	3340062	Just getting some more replies with Determine and actually I'm sending applications on PI for those who cannot pre-register online and stuff.
3341183	3344564	And just got off of CCL to see what new arcades they have gotten.
3345820	3347941	Of course, everyone knows they have 6th style there.
3348901	3353382	And they're replacing one of the DDR machines with the In The Groove machine.
3353402	3354002	Wait, what?
3354162	3354362	What?
3355222	3356542	They have 6th style at CCL?
3357382	3359383	No, it's just B-Mania 3.
3359723	3360223	Oh, B-Mania 3.
3360503	3361283	Yeah, I'd heard about that.
3361583	3362263	Not 2DX.
3363284	3363584	Okay.
3364384	3364804	I gotcha.
3364964	3366804	You know how crowded that's going to be in CCL.
3369305	3369625	All right.
3371005	3372746	The rest will be held in my FUs.
3372926	3373646	Oh, goody, goody.
3373906	3374206	All right.
3375017	3375397	Moving on.
3376157	3376797	Wow, guys.
3376857	3378578	Well, what can I say in studio here?
3378658	3379778	There's, what, like 11 people here?
3379838	3380578	Pull up a floor.
3382898	3384599	Please try not to fart in studio.
3384639	3385919	We'd appreciate that.
3387639	3388139	Moving on.
3388259	3394921	I noticed Loki's over on our webcam there at www.orangeentrader.com and he's holding up pieces of this modified Xbox.
3395241	3401922	Tell us, for the listeners that haven't heard about what you're doing here with this Xbox, tell us about this little project that you've picked up, Loki, about modifying an Xbox.
3402611	3403292	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3418419	3438506	No, um, usually they're fanless, but this one being a 1 gigahertz processor is not fanless, but they're really fucking small, so you're, you know, able to put them in the really small, um, cases, like the Xbox case here, so it's actually gonna have, the way I have it working right now is it's actually gonna run all off a battery.
3439656	3441457	So it's going to be 100% portable.
3441577	3450023	For a monitor, I'm actually using a portable PlayStation PS1 LCD screen that's 5 inches.
3451724	3452945	All going to be portable, though.
3453165	3453585	Completely 100%.
3453685	3456167	Nerd!
3457388	3464793	Hey, it's us four, so we can, you know, do our, you know, Orange Lounge Radio To Go editions from the road, from E3.
3466286	3466426	Nerds!
3489454	3493158	Hey, I'm pictochatting with someone sitting right next to me.
3494200	3494520	You know what?
3494700	3497183	I'd be playing DS2, but I left it at my buddy's house.
3497463	3498404	Whoops, in my jacket.
3498485	3499145	Shame on you.
3502449	3502950	Oh, well.
3503691	3504051	Anyway, um...
3505780	3509323	I want to get to some actual DDR news, you guys.
3509984	3513967	Actual news about a really big rhythm music game going on right now.
3514688	3521414	As we talked about a couple weeks ago, there's going to be a brand new DDR game coming out on the GameCube, and it's called DDR with Mario.
3522255	3530342	And we knew that we were going to be getting some more information on this game after the Tokyo, what was it, the Tokyo Hobby Fair or something like that that just took place very recently?
3531583	3532343	Did I screw up the name?
3532404	3532744	Probably.
3533459	3540242	So anyway, this Tokyo Fair just happened, and not only did we get a lot more information about this game, we got videos.
3540945	3550713	So I'm going to show some videos in studio right now, and for those of you on stream, I know this makes for really great radio, but for those of you on stream, you can actually listen to this over the stream.
3550733	3557239	We'll be playing this for you guys, and what's really cool is that you can actually hear some of the music that's going to be in DDR Mario through this.
3557619	3564185	So I'm going to play this, and this first video should be a song that you guys really recognize, at least I hope so.
3565860	3576228	And if you want to check out these videos for yourself, just head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on the news story that we posted earlier about this.
3577950	3579451	By the way, thank Dan for those.
3580172	3580892	Oh, did he find those?
3581032	3582413	Dan found those for me last night.
3582774	3583214	Very nice.
3584155	3591761	By the way, if anybody happens to have an IGN Insider account, please let us know because we need your assistance.
3592842	3593182	All right.
3593587	3597631	Okay, here's one video, and listen carefully for the song that's playing in the background.
3597691	3598752	It sounds very familiar.
3614393	3615454	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3656210	3657711	Now I want to point this out in the video.
3657731	3659252	Let me turn this down a little bit.
3659592	3660793	Because you guys can hear the song.
3661354	3665998	In the video, you'll notice that some of the arrows are actually pictures of Boo.
3666638	3667239	The little Boo.
3668192	3673976	And when you step on that, it makes this giant ghost appear on your opponent's side that blocks the arrows.
3674496	3677078	So they're incorporating some of the Versus Mode stuff in it.
3685944	3690366	Very interesting there, because you notice that the DDR Max announcer was in that.
3690887	3691567	Perfect!
3691887	3692768	You know, all that stuff.
3693448	3696630	Very... I don't know if it's Thomas Howard, I don't know.
3696650	3697111	Maybe.
3697191	3697471	Maybe.
3698455	3702416	The lady's voice in the background, we think, is just at the show.
3702476	3703857	We don't think it's actually a part of the game.
3703897	3704997	Yeah, she's just a part of the show.
3705437	3708078	But you could probably hear it in the background, that medley that's playing.
3708358	3710419	You knew that this would happen in a DDR Mario game.
3710459	3711819	It's a dance version of the Mario Bros.
3711839	3711939	theme.
3711959	3714920	From Super Mario 2, or USA, first stage.
3721226	3722608	Yep, so very interesting there.
3722989	3725111	Now, this next one is very interesting.
3725152	3727495	I want to show you this one, the last clip.
3727535	3728396	It's clip number four.
3728817	3732642	This is one of my favorites because they actually have Mario and Luigi dancing in it.
3733022	3735546	But this will allow you to hear one of the other songs that's in the game.
3736187	3736627	And, um...
3737469	3745331	We're going to get a little hint of the gameplay, because you'll notice the arrows aren't only just replaced with the boos, but they also have the Goombas and the Koopa Troopas.
3745771	3746512	Very interesting.
3746572	3747812	Very Nintendo-fied, this game.
3747832	3749432	We're going to talk about it a little more here in a minute.
3749913	3758915	Let me get this other clip queued up here, and we'll watch it in studio, and you guys can hear a clip of the song that's going to be in DDR with Mario. ...
3766229	3770516	and in this video they have para para girls doing a routine to the song
3789318	3793881	And they have girls paraparrying to a basic song on DDR Mario here.
3800506	3804749	And male DDR fans everywhere have a new masturbatory video to watch.
3807010	3809032	I just want to point out though, look how Mario dances.
3811130	3811891	Look at Luigi!
3812011	3812771	He's making waves!
3812811	3813592	He's doing the Watusi!
3813612	3815553	See, there's a Koopa Troopa that just went up.
3832791	3835172	I'm rather impressed that they can patapata in there too
3861815	3862976	Very interesting.
3863876	3870601	Now, I realize you guys at home listening right now can't really see what we're watching, but you can get the videos on the website.
3870641	3876785	It's got to be interesting also to hear the songs there, but what do you guys think now that you've seen a little bit of DDR Mario in action?
3876985	3880188	Hold on, let me tell you guys a little bit more information about this game going on.
3880888	3889434	Basically, what's going on is that they only were able to check out a demo version, of course, naturally, at the Tokyo...
3892709	3894265	The World Hobby Fair, that's it.
3894751	3895511	The World Hobby Fair.
3895531	3898692	They were only able to have a little mini version of the game.
3898732	3900233	And here's what the mini version featured.
3900693	3903474	Is that it kind of featured only the two-player mode.
3903734	3906295	And Mario and Luigi were the only playable characters in it.
3906595	3908435	And there were only about seven songs.
3908735	3912877	And it does talk about that Goomba and Koopa show up as special icons.
3913237	3917578	When you see a Goomba icon, if you tap the appropriate space on the dance pad, it smashes it.
3917918	3921999	If you smash a Koopa twice, you'll send it flying back down the column.
3922099	3923640	And it'll knock out all the other arrows.
3924060	3924640	in the column.
3925480	3929781	So they've come up with all these interesting little, very Nintendo-like things.
3929801	3933622	And then the boo, if you step on the boo, it makes the ghost bigger on the other side and it hides the arrows.
3933882	3936202	And then, of course, there's a little picture of the dance mat here.
3937843	3938803	Very interesting.
3940503	3946284	I'm going to head on over to DDR Freak because I know on the thread there over DDR Freak they were talking about some of the songs that are actually going to be in it.
3946524	3949165	Of course, you heard there the song from Super Mario Bros.
3949205	3950405	Part 2, Stage 1 in it.
3951388	3953089	What do you guys think after seeing some of those videos?
3953149	3955190	Jamie, you were the one that showed me these videos in the first place.
3955210	3955631	What do you think?
3956371	3957472	I think it's adorable.
3959013	3962435	I just think it's cool watching them do the cute little dances and turning around.
3962695	3963475	And then the big boo.
3964136	3964936	It had the big boo.
3965237	3966377	And I love the big boo.
3968639	3972501	I'm quoting from a post here from Unknown Gamer over on DDR Freak.
3972541	3975343	It's post number 202 in the GameCube DDR thread.
3975723	3978024	And they're saying some of the songs that they've translated...
3979432	3983913	Let's see, we have Here We Go from Super Mario Bros., Hoppin' Choppin' from Super Mario Bros.
3984013	3988775	USA, and then look at this, Para Para Carmen, like the opera Carmen.
3989355	3989715	That's wrong.
3989735	3990736	A Para Para version.
3991316	3997158	Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Mozart in the Pipe, Then Go the You, A Small Night's Music.
3997798	4000079	That's the name of the song, Then Go the Pipe.
4002879	4007641	Credit there to Unknown Gamer over at DDR Freak for translating some of those and putting them in a post there.
4008374	4010155	You know my thoughts on this?
4010315	4011055	Well, I'll get to my thoughts.
4011075	4011815	I want to hear you guys.
4011835	4012395	I've talked enough.
4013196	4016557	I just want to know if there's going to be a mushroom icon.
4016577	4020038	If you step on that, it gives a hallucinogenic effect to the other player or something.
4022859	4025500	The whole game seems like a big hallucinogenic effect.
4026540	4028501	Well, what would you expect, though, from this?
4028641	4030121	DDR with Mario, honestly.
4033603	4033863	Alright.
4034763	4034883	Um...
4035296	4036436	I think it looks fun.
4036796	4042658	I mean, it'd be interesting to, I think mainly the big thing for me is just the music, you know, see what they're going to do with the Nintendo tunes.
4044478	4048539	I think they should have a secret, like, other Nintendo characters thing in there too, though.
4048579	4052200	Like, you know, you got Samus, and you get Samus music.
4052500	4055661	Yeah, dude, the Samus shuffle, I don't know.
4058482	4060682	The Morph Ball slide, I don't know.
4061383	4062763	How about Mel, Mel B?
4064191	4064772	Um, gosh.
4064812	4066933	You gotta admit, that Power Par Freestyle was pretty hot.
4067513	4075178	Um, yeah, I must say, it reinforces my belief that, pretty much, Power Par is a female thing, and it only looks good that way.
4076219	4080662	But, um, that said, I mean, looking at the gameplay and stuff, it reminds me a lot of basically just...
4081252	4084335	Disney Rave Magic on Crack, which, you know, is a cool thing.
4084415	4090019	It's like one of those concepts that Ultramix 2, you know, kind of tried to do with its battle mode and like other gimmicks.
4090360	4094783	This one kind of takes into a more, I guess, recognizable form, which is kind of cool.
4095464	4107594	It's kind of neat to see the music that seems to hear, you know, what I heard as far as music-wise, but hypothetically, if this comes out, say, you know, to a stateside release, I can't see it doing a whole lot better, you know.
4107834	4108435	It's sort of like
4109096	4110177	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4130390	4130911	DDR Ultramix 1
4153362	4154022	All right, so other comments?
4154062	4154182	Angel.
4154202	4156403	It does have potential, though, so you never know.
4181576	4183337	Yeah, I thought it was really cool.
4183457	4186438	I would probably be one of those people to be like, oh, I'm still getting that.
4187178	4190320	Just because it's DDR and it's cute and whatever.
4191060	4193921	Did you say one of the songs called Mozart on the Pipe?
4194282	4195382	Something like that.
4195402	4196763	Stoner DDR is right, yeah.
4197543	4199364	I didn't know Mary and Barry was Mozart.
4201945	4205386	Any other thoughts from those of you guys on the couch or over at Sharks Girl?
4205426	4206387	I don't know anybody.
4207067	4208788	Are you going to pick up DDR Mario Sharks Girl?
4208808	4208848	No.
4210572	4212113	What is it about this game that looks so cool?
4212513	4215334	I don't know, it's just, it's something different for once.
4215715	4219496	I think, it's just, it's so gay.
4222438	4223718	Wait, whoa.
4226319	4227640	Watch your language, Rob.
4229261	4234183	I don't mean gay as in butt sex, I mean gay as in happy.
4234263	4234943	Okay, Eminem.
4239457	4242038	I mean, look at Disney Rave, especially like the U.S.
4242278	4243039	one, Disney Mix.
4243499	4246360	Dude, you can't pick that up anywhere for under like $130.
4247041	4247841	Oh, my God.
4247861	4249282	Yeah, check eBay.
4249922	4251883	I found it at Network Video for cheap.
4252603	4254124	Did you get the Japanese or the American one?
4254964	4259006	The American one is the one that's going for... Oh, I'm talking about the one on the Nintendo 64.
4259066	4259767	Oh, that one.
4261187	4262748	But I have both of them anyway.
4263008	4263949	Yeah, well, so does Mel.
4264009	4264829	You know, it's no big deal.
4264889	4266470	But, you know, it's like people like...
4267842	4269483	I really hope Princess Peach is an unlockable character.
4269503	4269544	If...
4295655	4297656	In fact, this is my letter to Nintendo.
4298276	4306480	Dear Nintendo, In the upcoming game, DDR with Mario, I hereby request that Princess Peach be a playable character.
4307261	4310722	If this is to be the case, I will play your game every day.
4311323	4312183	Drunk off my ass.
4312964	4313284	Naked.
4314584	4320107	You know they're gonna pull the whole, was it, um, was it the ME and Ultramix 2 thing?
4320327	4320927	Was that what it was?
4321008	4321868	From Ultramix 2 or whatever?
4322588	4323429	Oh, the Coochie Cutters?
4323749	4329934	Yeah, yeah, like, uh, with, uh, they'll do that with Princess Peach, she'll be all, like, whored out and stuff, the Daisy Dukes, and it's like, woo!
4330094	4330775	That'd be beautiful.
4330835	4331515	Or not.
4332736	4336599	If you're a girl, you're with me, it sucks trying to play DDR in a skirt, okay?
4338140	4340422	Yeah, they better put her in, like, hot pants or something, I don't know.
4342564	4346307	If the only reason you want Princess Peach in DDR is for an upskirt cam...
4347353	4348754	You get that in Super Smash Bros.
4348795	4349675	Melee, my friend.
4350176	4353459	And may I also say it sucks trying to play DDR in platform boots.
4353559	4358083	Been there, done that, failed.
4358223	4362066	Actually, my first time on a DDR machine was in somebody else's Broken in Combat boots.
4363407	4369232	I was cosplaying as Jill Valentine from Resident Evil.
4370093	4370954	That was pain.
4371815	4372996	Utter and complete pain.
4374068	4382371	One of my first times on a DDR machine, especially alone, I was wearing four-inch heels with two-and-a-half-inch platform boots, and I failed Butterfly Basic.
4382692	4383392	I sucked.
4384973	4386793	Can't say I've ever played with platform shoes.
4387594	4388134	Or high heels.
4388414	4388854	Thank goodness.
4390675	4392516	I wish I could say the same, but no, I'm kidding.
4392696	4393056	I haven't.
4393236	4393596	Oh, wait.
4393636	4394416	Dr. Dick, huh?
4395757	4396597	Aha!
4396677	4397278	You funny.
4397698	4398038	Failed.
4398058	4399458	Hey, Rob, I can lend you the boots.
4399478	4400039	I still got them.
4400099	4400279	Hey!
4400299	4400359	Yes.
4402900	4403080	Yes.
4403544	4404745	Are you guys still doing comments?
4406346	4408588	Yes, Mario, what do you want to say about DDR Mario?
4409408	4410910	Well, I think it's a very good concept.
4410970	4415613	Of course, like everyone says, anything with Mario and Luigi would sell, in a way.
4415993	4420917	And with the new DDR pads for the GameCube, who knows what they'll do with Mario Party 7, maybe.
4423599	4424400	Oh, God.
4424980	4426842	Mario Party 7, I didn't even think about that.
4426882	4430324	What's going to be the asinine peripheral that's going to go with Mario Party 7?
4430404	4431205	Probably this.
4433266	4436448	Have you seriously played Mario Party 6 with a microphone?
4436808	4437149	Yes.
4437889	4438669	Move up.
4440230	4441311	Goomba.
4441391	4441871	Goomba.
4442192	4443232	Mario Party!
4447675	4451998	And then you have to go faster, faster, faster, faster, faster, faster, faster, faster!
4452178	4452858	Mario Party!
4453159	4453839	Mario Party!
4454119	4454760	Mario Party!
4455880	4458422	This is seriously what playing Mario Party 6 sounds like.
4461144	4461364	Okay.
4463286	4464067	Oh my gosh.
4464087	4470212	Oh my gosh.
4471513	4480300	Anyways, but since how like Donkey Kong became like a good, a pretty decent success seller, I think this would sell pretty well.
4480700	4490008	I wonder what it's going to do with like some of the features, maybe a Koopa Shell while playing the game, and if you touch it you lose health, maybe, sort of like mines, fucking set mania in a way.
4491630	4495631	or if they play a damn hard song, they actually consider pipe raping or so.
4497591	4497911	Pipe.
4498832	4499672	Pipe raping.
4499732	4500352	What the hell?
4504193	4504593	All right.
4506713	4507433	Moving on.
4507513	4508814	I think we're going to go to a break.
4508914	4513955	When we come back from this break, we're going to do a little more news and then the Orange Lounge Radio cage match when we come back.
4515726	4516126	You know what?
4516206	4522270	I just realized I lost all my Poppin' Music 9 consumer tracks when I got my new hard drive, so I don't have that song you wanted.
4522290	4522891	That's crappy.
4522911	4523191	I'm sorry.
4523211	4524391	Is there something else you wanted to hear, darling?
4525152	4525892	The Safari.
4526413	4527353	Okay, you got it.
4527533	4528154	The Safari.
4529214	4536719	We'll be back after this break featuring starting it off with The Safari, and we'll be back with the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, etc., etc.
4536819	4543083	Remember, if you want to participate in tonight's Cage Match, you've got to be in the chat room, or else it just sucks to be you.
4543103	4544504	We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio.
4565343	4566124	Thanks for watching!
4666053	4668014	Thanks for watching!
4759617	4760619	Thank you for watching!
4836651	4838113	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4863928	4864890	Thank you for watching!
4897502	4899083	Gaming Radio, so uncensored.
4927177	4931720	and even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
4931860	4933201	Orange Lounge Radio.
4937584	4939965	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4941046	4942767	Thanks for tuning in tonight, boys and girls.
4943507	4944228	Great turnout.
4944288	4944948	Thank you, guys.
4945028	4947430	We love it when our ratings get whored up.
4947850	4949871	Not only in studio, but online as well.
4950352	4953934	I think we broke a record in the chat room with well over 40 people in chat.
4954014	4954594	Pretty crazy.
4955255	4955475	Yeah.
4956875	4959762	And then we got more people in here than I've seen in a long time.
4959802	4960443	This is great.
4961004	4961746	Thank you guys very much.
4963416	4967038	Go ahead and open up the Skype line right now if you want to call into the show.
4967498	4973021	If you are curious about how you use the Skype line, head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com.
4973341	4977323	Click on Interact With Us, and that will show you how you can interact with the show.
4977363	4978563	Now, I've got to warn you guys, though.
4978963	4984566	I think there might be some issues with the Skype line tonight, so we're going to kind of play it on the fly.
4984966	4990989	Because I did make some changes to my computer this week, I think there might be some echoes when you guys are talking on Skype.
4991289	4992669	And if there is, I apologize.
4992749	4993830	We'll just see what happens.
4994810	4997191	We're just going to wing it and try taking a call and see what happens.
4997231	4998391	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4999491	5000752	It's me, Legend of Zaku.
5001132	5003032	Hello, it's me, Legend of Zaku.
5003072	5003532	How are you?
5004413	5004793	Fine.
5006153	5006773	I don't know.
5006933	5010134	In two days, we're about to see the new Dancing Stage Fusion.
5010194	5013455	So I wonder how big is the coverage on that going to be?
5013475	5016956	Because we're going to find out this new hardware and everything about it.
5017364	5020445	Well, Dancing Stage Fusion... Well, you know, very good point you're bringing up.
5020485	5023786	Dancing Stage Fusion is supposedly going to be out this week.
5024226	5027808	So, or we're supposed to... No, it's not that it's out, but we get to see it at some extra.
5027828	5028288	Two more days.
5028928	5032689	Tuesday should be... It's going to be debuted on Tuesday in London.
5032969	5034610	Right, it's going to be at that show, right?
5035447	5041851	I was just checking out the boards, I mean, I was just checking out the Freak right there, and there's only like a few people that are actually going.
5042391	5045633	I know one of the mods basically couldn't go that day, but, you know, that's about it.
5045653	5050035	You know what... I don't know if it's coverage-wise, how... Here's how it works, though, Zaku, seriously.
5050376	5057300	If one person goes, and one person goes, and one person takes a camera with them, that's all it takes for this to get all over the internet.
5057360	5059561	And you know some of the big gaming sites are going to be there.
5060561	5061082	I would say...
5062963	5065804	I doubt Mist and DDRUK would know.
5066384	5071386	Well, DDRUK is in a bit of trouble right now.
5071506	5074667	I'm not going to say you're not going to hear anything from them because I really don't know.
5074727	5075508	I don't run that site.
5075548	5076488	I don't know what they've got planned.
5076508	5078989	I don't know if Mist is going to send people from his site.
5079893	5083455	and post on the Freak, but we'll just wait and see.
5084175	5088797	I'm hoping, you know what, DDR Freak is usually the hub of all the DDR information.
5089257	5094439	Even if it gets posted to another site, like Aaron in Japan usually has a lot of news breaks over there.
5095020	5098301	If they break it, it's going to be posted on DDR Freak.
5098361	5099622	That's the beauty of the internet.
5099762	5102763	It's the information superhighway and we all share the information.
5103323	5106505	You will not be left out in the cold with the information, Zaku.
5106985	5109246	Anything we find out, Zaku, I assure you we'll bring you.
5109971	5112892	All right, that's cool.
5113212	5113773	Let me see.
5114293	5115013	Anything else?
5115653	5122796	Well, I got money for buying 2DX products and basically starting to get into that thing.
5122836	5128258	I just need a great deal on a 2DX controller and at least one style that could be affordable.
5128698	5130098	I'm going to spend about $100.
5130358	5131879	Let me poll the chat room right now.
5132219	5134640	Most affordable 2DX controller you've seen lately?
5135720	5136161	None of them.
5138007	5140088	Whatever you do, don't buy the triangular looking one.
5140208	5141469	Yeah, don't buy the cheap one.
5141509	5142009	You know what?
5142029	5142550	You know what?
5143690	5145551	Don't buy anything but the official stuff.
5146212	5147753	You'll be wasting your money otherwise.
5148793	5149954	You get what you pay for.
5150034	5151615	If you pay for cheap, you get cheap.
5151895	5153196	And it breaks in five days.
5155314	5156895	I'm not getting the Rave Discman.
5156955	5158996	I know that I'm not getting the Rave Discman.
5159016	5162559	There's no way I'm getting the damn Rave Discman.
5162599	5163840	Just buy a real controller.
5163900	5165081	Go to Toys and Joys.
5165221	5166142	What the?
5166342	5169245	But you know how they still charge different prices depending on the size.
5169325	5171066	I know, but you know, they're 80 bucks.
5172647	5174809	That's how much these puppies cost.
5174849	5176670	That's cheaper than what I paid for mine.
5176690	5177891	Shipping's like 40 bucks.
5178632	5180273	I paid 120 for mine.
5180894	5182275	Don't complain about 80 dollars.
5183924	5187649	Well, all I can say, shop around, Zaku.
5187849	5189911	Go to Toys and Joys, Hameya.
5189971	5191834	But never order from Byright.
5192014	5196679	Never, ever, ever, ever order from Byright because they will screw you.
5197821	5198481	Without lube.
5199062	5200043	It will be painful.
5201044	5202526	Shop around, Zaku.
5202546	5203247	That's the best you can do.
5204672	5206393	All right, bud, I'm going to let you go so we can take another call.
5206593	5207494	But thanks for calling in, as always.
5207514	5208354	All right, thanks a lot, man.
5208394	5208875	Take care, Zach.
5209755	5210736	Let's go to the next call.
5210776	5212317	I see another line ringing here.
5212657	5215158	Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
5216299	5216859	Hey, what's up?
5216879	5218840	This is DJ Ranma S from the East Coast.
5218900	5220801	I have a box full of snow for you guys.
5221081	5224403	Oh, hooray, snow, because we don't get that here, seriously.
5225264	5226064	I kind of figured.
5226525	5227705	What's on your mind, Ranma S?
5229046	5229766	Ranma.
5230107	5230707	Ranma.
5232541	5236742	I don't know, if you wanted to be literal, you could just call him Wild Horse S, because that's what Ranma means.
5236762	5237703	How about Ranmask?
5237743	5239243	You want me to start calling you Ranmask?
5240183	5242184	Sure, Sky, you can call me whatever you like.
5242324	5243584	Call me through the phone.
5244004	5244825	Okay, George.
5245105	5245245	No.
5245585	5246185	What's on your mind?
5247005	5248766	I don't much want to know how you guys are doing over there.
5248806	5250906	I want some of that warm weather, because I'm freezing here.
5251246	5253627	We will put some warm weather in a box and send it to you.
5253747	5254287	How does that sound?
5255147	5255668	Even trade?
5256428	5256968	Sure, why not?
5257679	5258939	Hey, that works for me, boys.
5258979	5259999	That works great for me.
5260580	5262180	What's going on on the East Coast scene right now?
5263040	5263840	Uh, not much.
5263900	5266261	It's been... Everybody's just dealing with the snow.
5266281	5268601	It's like, we got like two feet over here.
5268641	5270382	People complaining about the weather, you know.
5271162	5271882	Work sucks.
5271942	5275323	People complain that we closed early yesterday, but we were in the middle of a snowstorm.
5275343	5276203	What do you expect us to do?
5276503	5280404	I could not imagine anything closing due to snow.
5281064	5282624	But I'm spoiled by California.
5282644	5283104	What can I say?
5284484	5287005	Right or not, I would love to be in California for about a good two weeks.
5287926	5298294	Now, didn't you come out here for the expo, or am I getting my... No, no, no, no, I'm not coming out for Anime Expo, but I am coming out there for Anime Vegas sometime in September.
5298475	5299575	Ooh, I want to go to Vegas.
5299595	5301737	Whatever you do, never go to AX, because it sucks.
5302378	5303779	I'm going to Anime this year.
5304559	5306121	I have no plans to go to AX.
5306761	5312025	I sent some friends of mine out there from the Econ Reports, they said it sucked, so I have no plans to go.
5312826	5315688	Someone, I was cosplaying Mad Hatter.
5316297	5318738	I said, did you snap their neck or send somebody after them to hurt them?
5319038	5322779	I still didn't hear Did you snap their neck or send somebody after them to hurt them?
5346353	5349375	I did step on somebody's foot in the 4-inch boots.
5350296	5351036	That works for me.
5351116	5351636	There you go.
5352817	5353698	Anything else on your mind?
5354578	5355178	No, that's it.
5355198	5356539	I just wanted to hear you guys.
5356559	5357400	That's all, basically.
5357420	5358420	Love the show.
5358500	5360241	Thoughts on DDR Mario, real quick.
5362003	5364244	I already have it pre-reserved at my store.
5364824	5365625	Then there you have it.
5365765	5366705	Alright, thanks for calling.
5368246	5368546	Laters.
5368747	5369387	Have a good one, buddy.
5370407	5371608	We're hearing from all sorts of people.
5371628	5373109	Let's do one more call, then we'll get to the cage match.
5373429	5374450	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
5375478	5376799	Hey Sky, it's El Mullet.
5376939	5378119	Hello El Mullet!
5378620	5379560	Hello Sky!
5379820	5382062	Oh, he with my favorite nickname on the internet.
5382082	5382482	What's up?
5384383	5385924	Today's a pretty big day for me.
5386084	5387504	Got to move back into school.
5387564	5388825	I'm in the dorm room right now.
5389546	5390506	Ah, dorm life.
5390626	5391767	Duh, duh, duh.
5391987	5392867	I'm sorry, man.
5393428	5393828	I know.
5393868	5395449	Bad internet connections and all.
5395649	5396769	Quick poll in the studio.
5396809	5398330	Who here has lived in a college dorm?
5399591	5400852	Just me and Jamie?
5401272	5401652	That's it?
5402017	5402997	Wow, oh my god.
5403057	5403718	College dorm life.
5403738	5405278	Living in the dorm was the best.
5405558	5407959	Living in the dorm was horrible, horrible, horrible.
5407999	5409259	I would never wish that upon anybody.
5409639	5417122	My dorm was so awesome because, first of all, our person who watched us never really cared what we did.
5417582	5418702	So my friend had durables.
5419022	5419983	They were the VCRs.
5421823	5430506	And then I also lived within walking distance of a bar slash deli slash arcade that would get imports and pirate kits.
5431434	5432015	All the time.
5433136	5434658	And they were open 24 hours.
5435519	5436019	Dang.
5436720	5437301	That's pretty nice.
5438302	5443608	The only good thing about living in the dorms for me was that I was the only one that had a Super Nintendo.
5444089	5446712	So all the boys would come over and play Mario Kart.
5447205	5451027	My roommate actually had a Playstation when it came out and I had a TV and she didn't.
5451447	5453648	So we had it hooked up at a VCR.
5453688	5455548	I would skip my witchcraft class.
5456249	5457269	I took History of Witchcraft.
5457569	5458009	I did too.
5458469	5459710	To watch Sailor Moon.
5460650	5462391	It just dates when I lived in the dorms.
5462935	5467339	You know, you're guaranteed college popularity if you have something very obscure.
5467939	5471262	See, I didn't quite get to the second half of my story.
5471322	5479609	See, I was popular when I had the Super Nintendo, but then when the upstairs guys got the Nintendo 64, nobody loved Rob anymore.
5480029	5481590	Nobody loved Rob anymore.
5482931	5487055	Well, the other thing that was cool about me living on campus is I had a job on campus.
5487575	5489457	I worked in our pool hall slash arcade.
5490257	5490758	Oh, that's cool.
5491352	5495835	and I ran our tournaments and my first time playing a Saturn was playing Japanese games.
5496135	5496876	You know what?
5497436	5500779	Our college built an arcade the year after I left.
5501299	5501980	Those cocks.
5502440	5502820	Sucky.
5503080	5503341	I know.
5503641	5505282	Anyway, I'm sorry, Elmo, we got sidetracked.
5505302	5506763	What did you call in to talk to us about tonight?
5507483	5510446	I called to talk about various things.
5510786	5511186	Alright.
5512227	5513888	DDR Mario, for example.
5513948	5515209	I'm really looking forward to it.
5516330	5518151	Yes, I want to know your thoughts on DDR Mario.
5519178	5526941	Well, first of all, considering it's a joint project between Konami and Nintendo, I mean, how can that possibly go wrong?
5527962	5534545	I know, I'm just a giddy little fanboy thinking about the possibilities when Konami and Nintendo join forces.
5534665	5535885	This game's going to rock.
5536265	5540207	It's going to be really nauseously cute, but it's going to rock.
5540971	5542272	Hey, wait a minute, I'm a Nintendo fanboy!
5570681	5573602	Any wishes, things you want to see in DDR Mario?
5574523	5581525	I want to see a crapload of Konami original remixes of Nintendo songs.
5581545	5582305	That would be incredible.
5582325	5583325	I need lots of Taku.
5594685	5596867	Oh, Jamie wants Taku to come over and remix and stuff.
5596887	5600410	Imagine Taku doing, like, the dungeon one from the first Super Mario Bros.
5600550	5604854	Seriously, could you imagine it?
5605474	5606175	It'd be pretty hot.
5606635	5611159	If I had one wish, I want a dance remix of the Zelda 2 dungeon theme.
5612400	5620327	Oh, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-
5624474	5626454	Oh, and then we have a comment in the chat room.
5626474	5630095	Miklatov, Akira Yamaoka better fucking be in it remixing anything.
5631035	5631395	Amen to that.
5631415	5634296	You're a great Mario happy joy go lucky mix.
5634316	5635276	Winner is you.
5635376	5640337	I mean, seriously, if he can do like Bitmania and all that stuff, imagine him remixing like a Mario theme.
5641177	5641937	I just got a boner.
5642377	5642677	No.
5643497	5643697	No.
5643857	5644237	Kidding.
5644377	5644697	Kidding.
5644757	5648398	No, Akira Yamaoka remixing music from Luigi's Mansion.
5650198	5651979	No, we want music that people have actually heard.
5653059	5653339	What?
5654858	5658139	Did you think Luigi's Mansion was kind of fun, spooky?
5658199	5659639	Yeah, but the game was kind of not.
5659659	5660600	The game was cute.
5660640	5664301	Luigi's Mansion was a great YouTube tech demo.
5665161	5665981	That's pretty much it.
5666001	5668842	If it came with the system, it would have been a hell of a lot better.
5669022	5671102	But we had to pay $50 for it, so.
5672483	5675204	Personally, I think it sucked.
5676184	5676524	Get it?
5677539	5680422	Because Luigi had a vacuum.
5681463	5683445	Oh my god, why did I call him?
5683525	5684026	Loser!
5685968	5691073	Anyway, any other thoughts on your mind, Elmullet, on this lovely Sunday evening?
5691653	5692854	There are many, many thoughts.
5692954	5694196	Which one would you like me to share?
5695137	5695697	I don't know.
5696898	5697539	The third one.
5698325	5699185	The third one?
5700286	5700846	I don't know.
5700906	5701966	It's a little risque.
5702867	5705548	So I'll just skip to the fourth one and chill out my side again.
5706968	5707148	What?
5707168	5707449	I'm sorry.
5707489	5707849	I missed that.
5708569	5710910	I'll just skip to the fourth one and chill out my side again.
5711490	5711790	Okay.
5712090	5712450	Oh, okay.
5712510	5712931	Go for it.
5713851	5720594	www.insidepulse.com Go to the game section and read me specifically and other people because they're awesome.
5721594	5725015	We only let him whore out that because he whores us out all the time.
5725615	5726196	Every week.
5726756	5726976	I know.
5727438	5728859	We appreciate the whoring out, buddy.
5729680	5730140	No problem.
5730220	5735144	Alright, we're looking forward to more information on DDR Mario showing up on Inside Pulse as it comes out.
5735644	5735984	Alright.
5736064	5736785	Alright, take care, bud.
5737866	5738106	Bye.
5738446	5738726	Later.
5739527	5740968	DarkSakura has an announcement.
5741368	5741969	In local news.
5742629	5743350	In local news.
5744411	5747593	I put the final nail in the coffin on Sackbimani today.
5749134	5751756	Aww, Sackbimani is dead and gone and is no more.
5751776	5754038	Is making way for Deathcake.com.
5756491	5759053	Since you're not going to say it anymore, Addict!
5760514	5761555	But you know we love you.
5761975	5763977	I'm not doing this for myself, I'm doing it for you guys.
5764257	5764537	I know.
5764578	5769341	Because I'm still probably not going to play more than a couple... It's group addiction therapy for you.
5770983	5772624	I'm still going to be too busy with school.
5772644	5773865	I know, it's all good.
5775137	5778859	All right, we're going to... Is that all you wanted to say about... You know what, though?
5778979	5784261	I gotta say, though, it is kind of sad to see Sakpamani go bye-bye, because it was kind of, you know... Not my fault it died.
5784482	5785262	I know, I know.
5785322	5802010	It was kind of the way we all got to know each other, and I think LiveJournal kind of... Not everyone would rather post in the crappy RBGL thread on... Well, the cool thing about the Sakpamani forums was that they had, like, the masturbation thread and things like that, and now people use their LiveJournals for that stuff, so... Still have a community.
5802728	5805429	In fact, I'm going to go start a masturbation thread on my life journal right now.
5807189	5809030	I can post it on my life journal right now.
5809050	5809850	Just kidding.
5810530	5811011	I'm kidding.
5811031	5811871	Gross.
5812691	5814091	Hey, wait a minute.
5814191	5814672	I'm hot.
5817552	5820573	Okay, if you get defriended by me in the next couple of days, you know why.
5824535	5826015	You need to play with the mouse a little bit.
5827195	5827615	Wait a minute.
5827696	5829596	Is Jamie telling Brad to click the mouse over there?
5829776	5831497	No, but we do need to be focused on the chat room.
5832357	5832617	All right.
5833047	5836369	Anyway, let's get to the Orange Lounge Radio cage match, shall we?
5838011	5842974	Even though I'm totally not ready to do the cage match tonight.
5844595	5847557	I need some more time filler here while I set up for cage match.
5847597	5847878	Help!
5852241	5853662	What is going on over there in the kitchen?
5856183	5857344	They're having an orgy in the kitchen.
5861547	5862028	Oh, boy.
5862148	5862568	All right.
5866256	5869798	The Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match Boys and Girls
5887569	5888930	and you can make a vote, okay?
5889470	5898954	The winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music & More program which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on this station when we're not live.
5899314	5901315	Alright, so it's your chance to pick a song.
5902056	5905017	Now, first off, you get to hear a clip of last week's winner.
5905257	5910159	You only get to hear a clip because it was the winner, so you already heard it because you listen to the show every week, right?
5910680	5911200	Alright, here it is.
5911901	5913022	A clip of song number one.
5913082	5917023	And remember guys, you cannot vote until all three songs have played in their entirety.
5917043	5918443	And then we'll tell you how to vote in the chat.
5918744	5919224	Alright, here it is.
5919624	5922005	Last week in the Orange Lounge Cage Match, we had a brand new winner.
5922385	5924466	An old favorite, Echo Image.
5924826	5927927	And here it is, song number one, Echo Image with Endless Day.
5965440	5966288	DarkSakura
6040366	6044530	They used to make much sense, but I was wrong
6060757	6065560	Challenger number one comes to us from DarkSakura, and you get to hear these songs in their entirety.
6065800	6067541	DarkSakura, what's challenger number one tonight?
6067642	6069923	Well, it's DJ Bobo, I believe.
6071024	6077208	I was at Tapioca Express last night, and they put in a DVD, and this song was on it, and the video was just really awesome.
6077868	6083392	And I instantly fell for this song, so I at least have an opportunity now to share it with everybody.
6084232	6084532	All right.
6085333	6085813	Anything else?
6086334	6086514	No.
6086534	6086914	All right.
6087349	6089090	Does there have to always be something?
6089370	6091290	No, but I just liked your description of the video.
6091970	6113077	The video was, okay, the video had this one guy getting onto a subway car, and there was, you know, just people of all types sitting around, just minding their own business, being singular, and then he starts handing out beer to everybody, to a nun, to this old man, to this kid, and also to everyone's own, oh, we're unified and we like beer.
6114557	6114977	Singing.
6115558	6116058	Very cool.
6116078	6116478	Over beer.
6117168	6118569	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6137717	6139118	The orgy's going somewhere else.
6139138	6139698	Well, thanks for coming.
6139718	6140958	We're relocating to the wild.
6141238	6144720	I think it's amazingly funny that we have the longest drive of all, and we're staying to the end.
6144820	6145920	Because you're troopers.
6145960	6150582	You're real fans, Shark Skrull, Mel B. We are hardcore like the Peach Pits.
6151783	6153604	All right, let's get to Jamie's song.
6153644	6153984	Here it is.
6154324	6157265	DJ Bobo with... I Believe.
6157425	6157825	I Believe.
6157845	6158946	DJ Bobo, I Believe.
6158986	6160226	Song number two in tonight's cage match.
6160246	6160486	Enjoy.
6171523	6172683	Hold on, small glitch there.
6172743	6173244	Sorry, guys.
6173384	6175004	Let me start it over here.
6175184	6175805	Sorry about that.
6175845	6177185	We've got to bring up the audio levels.
6177225	6179907	Here it is, song number two, DJ Bobo, I Believe.
6187090	6188971	I believe in magic
6197883	6202808	I believe in freedom I believe in dreams I believe in
6231991	6235991	I'm afraid we've placed our life in another piece
6277903	6280052	Thank you for watching!
6338897	6352198	I believe I believe my dream can be reality I believe my time on earth is destiny
6370035	6374538	I believe in love, I believe in magic, this is not enough, we are strong enough
6402333	6403093	All righty, guys.
6403113	6404655	That was song number two.
6404675	6407917	That was DJ Bobo with I Believe.
6408018	6409399	Do we believe in this song?
6410019	6410580	Let's find out.
6410620	6410860	Jamie.
6411140	6412842	I was just transfixed by this video.
6414203	6417166	I'm sitting there eating my tater tots and curry at CapEx.
6417926	6419027	I'm like, ooh.
6419448	6420208	So I give it a ten.
6421029	6421369	All right.
6422210	6422711	Who's got the mic?
6422731	6423171	Shark Skrull.
6424768	6425649	8.395 from Shark Scroll.
6425669	6426009	Uh, Explicit.
6426029	6426730	8.5 from Explicit.
6426990	6427411	Mel B.
6451654	6456775	Um, kind of throws me back to like the late 90s type of club techno type stuff.
6457175	6460416	Kind of sounds like No Mercy except a lot less whistled.
6461236	6462777	Um, I'll give it a 7.92.
6463917	6469659	Alright, um, for me personally, I definitely agree.
6469679	6471439	I was thinking the mid 90s thing as well.
6471859	6474820	Like an inspirational, I can do anything.
6476340	6478002	I believe I can fly like this.
6478062	6478362	I don't know.
6478402	6479103	It's like an inspirational.
6479403	6486830	Which is why I'm thinking about Jamie describing the video a little bit before and I'm like, that totally goes against that song.
6487171	6488432	No, it was about...
6490003	6491084	It was like a unity thing.
6491104	6491784	I believe in beer.
6491824	6493264	Everybody getting together over beer.
6493425	6497266	Alright, well, I'm not supposed, we're not supposed to take the videos into account during these Caged Vegetables.
6497286	6506510	So the song, Strictly Yourself, it was, I like the throwback aspect of it and it left me, it left me feeling hopeful and inspirational and making me want to pray.
6506691	6508731	So I give it a 6.66.
6509212	6510532	No, I gotta give it something higher than that.
6510732	6511353	An 8.666.
6511893	6516215	I believe I was bored, so I get the 7.
6519167	6522093	You know he's got to have his lame pun or it's just not a show.
6522594	6523536	Alright, here we go.
6523596	6525400	Song number three from Loki.
6527049	6529971	I was gonna put in the girls remix.
6530572	6538057	I was told in the chatroom to do it, I was told by Jamie to do it, but my judgment, you know, said no, that would be wrong.
6538218	6539579	So I'll do it next week if this doesn't win.
6539859	6544923	This is, um, I don't know for how many of you out there have seen the Sin City trailer.
6545603	6548585	Um, this is a song playing in the background, except that's the instrumental version.
6548625	6551668	This is The Cells by a group called The Servant.
6553609	6556111	Alright, song number three, The Cells by The Servant.
6557096	6582715	It'll all click when the mortgage clears All our fears will disappear Now you go to bed
6585576	6586957	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6613275	6627818	I look for each other in the TV screen The sun goes up and the sun goes down I drag myself into the sand All I do, all I do is dance with you Every day I'm at my dad's And my dad's got right there All I do, all I do
6647236	6651382	on the back of a manky cat now in I go like a
6662617	6678320	I watch them, watch me, I watch them too Across the street, across the room I dress myself like a charcoal sketch My eyes are brown and my hair's a mess They annoy me, they do employ me They could destroy me, they should enjoy me We Chinese are funny We look for each other in the TV screen
6697288	6710417	The sun goes up and the sun goes down, DarkSakura tells me to look down, All I do, all I wanna do is... Every day is not my day, Can I take a break from this?
6710517	6711538	All I do...
6724885	6731912	The sales I am at the moment will soon die, but I will be here
6751798	6766329	Oh, I'll still be here Just as I am at the moment We'll soon die But I won't be here Oh, I'll still be
6789302	6790224	Thanks for watching!
6852741	6856882	Alright, that was song number three, The Servant with the Cells.
6857123	6860464	Let's see if that was good cells or bad cells.
6860864	6861184	Jamie?
6861784	6862764	Mitochondria.
6862784	6863985	It's like parasites.
6864585	6866646	Um... And...
6868976	6870477	DarkSakura.com
6889790	6890050	6.8 Mel B
6914720	6917381	Um, it's quite a pretty good ambiance, actually.
6917581	6924902	I mean, not something I would bump in my system or nothing like that, but it kind of has a very, kind of a dark theme to it, obviously.
6925042	6929063	Kind of throws me to the, uh, Silent Hill 4 type, uh, music.
6929123	6931043	I was digging it, actually.
6931163	6939325	I'd give it a... But, although, when, you know, Loki was talking about Wildcard, I was expecting something wild, but it's all good.
6939345	6940585	I'll give it an 8.12.
6941285	6943966	Alright, my thoughts, personally, um, I would say...
6946134	6948355	I like the song, actually, quite a bit.
6948375	6949335	I'd probably give it like an 8.
6950136	6954438	But I just don't see it in an Orange Launch Radio cage match.
6954558	6956259	It doesn't gel right.
6956299	6957100	It doesn't click for me.
6958220	6960942	So I give it a... I would have given that even less score.
6962283	6964084	I give it like a 6.5.
6966125	6968086	You have to see this with the trailer.
6968386	6969847	It is goddamn sexy.
6969927	6970967	That's all I have to say.
6971428	6971808	Because...
6972358	7001490	now the instrumental version is going to be in the movie I think actually the guy's voice kind of takes away from the song because you missed all the cool guitar riffs but um I was looking hard for that instrumental version but I couldn't find it because the soundtrack's not out yet so but god damn it go see Sin City it's going to be fucking awesome coming out April 1st April 1st see Sin City the only movie you'll need to see the entire year screw Star Wars and King Kong this is the best movie ever
7002748	7003228	and I give it a 10.
7005529	7008591	Alright, it's not up to us to decide, it's up to you to decide.
7008611	7010732	You're going to place your vote for one of these three songs.
7011152	7013553	Song number one, Echo Image, Endless Day.
7023338	7028821	Song number two is DJ Bobo with a song called I Believe.
7042132	7046113	And song number three, The Servant, with a song called The Cells.
7054215	7056435	Place vote now.
7056535	7060056	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
7060096	7063477	And if you don't understand what I'm saying there, I'll type it in chat for you guys right now.
7064397	7065917	OrangeNotesRadio.com, click on chat.
7066277	7069738	In the meantime, Loki, how about that Sim scene?
7070757	7071679	DDR UK was shut down
7079605	7080506	Why it was shut down?
7080646	7081367	Voluntarily.
7081847	7083669	And here is why voluntarily.
7084070	7095461	Because the UK equivalent of the RIAA came after them and says, Currently the site has been placed into a temporary state of closure.
7095481	7103409	This is a direct response to communication from the IFPI in regards to a variety of links and files that were available from the site.
7103829	7108676	No direct legal action is being raised and this action has been voluntarily undertaken.
7109116	7111419	We hope for normal service to resume soon.
7111920	7114023	Now, there's a little bit more to go along with that.
7115725	7118208	And apparently this was posted in...
7119623	7121745	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7139239	7142341	I do know, well, the site was taken down voluntarily.
7142421	7143802	They haven't, you know, pressed charges.
7143862	7148484	It's due to response for the official files that were on there.
7148864	7152046	So, you know, obviously they got in trouble for that.
7152866	7154727	Where's the link here?
7157149	7157649	Let's see.
7160110	7161971	Now, there were some other interesting things on that.
7162391	7164833	Like, I wish I could really find this.
7166533	7167194	Where is it?
7171147	7176613	Anyways, it's basically they got the logs of everyone that downloaded that crap.
7176873	7182859	So they don't know what exactly that's going to entail as far as all the people that downloaded this stuff.
7185161	7187063	You know, whether they're going to get in trouble or whatnot.
7187443	7189185	Lucky for me, I don't download off that site.
7189225	7191968	At least none of the official stuff and not from there.
7193149	7194871	Now the other thing though, which was interesting...
7196356	7203819	Um, and this is in regards to, um, but my style, they're talking about taking down their sim file, um, I think too.
7203939	7204339	Here we go.
7204799	7206020	I, no, that's not it.
7207060	7211382	Um, and basically, you know, the same reasons, oh, okay, here we go.
7211542	7213863	The DDRUK legal proceedings fact.
7214363	7215443	It says, what happened to the site?
7215463	7221866	DDRUK was recently contacted by the IFPI regarding legally held music recordings being distributed on the site.
7222026	7224987	The recordings in question were the official sim files from Konami's
7225627	7226868	Dance Dance Revolution Game.
7227028	7227768	How'd they find out?
7227808	7229029	Officially, we do not know.
7230270	7235033	Unofficially, the AFPI website allows anonymous reporting of copyright infringement.
7235093	7244398	Since the downloads are only accessible by registered members, it is likely a DDRUK site member contacted the AFPI and gave them details of the files being stored.
7245859	7248421	Uh-oh, they must have banned somebody and they didn't like that.
7250566	7252147	Anyways, what's going to happen to the site?
7252187	7253287	Right now we do not know.
7253367	7257749	Myst is currently unreachable and is currently in discussions.
7258709	7262530	The site is down for the moment and is likely to remain that way until a later date.
7263191	7264171	Currently unconfirmed.
7264911	7267932	Is Myst facing a fine or jail time?
7267952	7269073	This is the guy that runs the site.
7269853	7273515	No, Myst has given full cooperation with the authorities.
7273575	7274615	They have requested that...
7275442	7276283	Thank you for watching.
7295185	7296747	He is avoiding any punitive action.
7297167	7298508	This is what will happen to the users.
7298848	7303352	This we do not know, aside from the fact that Myst has complied with the request.
7303772	7307835	We do not know what action, if any, the AFPI intend to take.
7309056	7311638	And this will be updated as they know more.
7313400	7317283	Comment from the chatroom, coming from Same, says that fact is fake.
7318092	7323813	And I'm sorry, but I tend to agree, because I wouldn't believe a goddamn thing I would read on the GameFAQs message boards.
7325133	7325613	Well, whatever.
7325673	7332815	Okay, all we know... Well, here's the thing that also was suspicious of me, is the BitTorrent files, they aren't on that server.
7332895	7338796	They're on DRAmerica.com, which also got shut down, but that's another thing entirely.
7339536	7341736	I think this is just a scare tactic, honestly.
7341916	7344037	I don't... I mean, come on, people.
7344617	7345357	It's freaking...
7346061	7347802	DDR SIM files.
7348162	7350342	They're not even often the full songs.
7350402	7352663	They're little cut-down versions of these full songs.
7353483	7362987	If they were really going to do lawsuits against the users of DDR UK, don't you think everybody that's ever used Supernova would be extremely fucked right about now?
7363567	7367608	I mean, seriously, you could have downloaded way more stuff.
7367688	7369249	Full CDs off Supernova.
7369409	7369809	DarkSakura.
7370205	7374106	Some of us still download full CDs off of ByTorrent.com
7391457	7400955	But even if they're trying to catch us or anything like that, we can always file back a counter-lawsuit for invading our privacy and stuff.
7402978	7407141	That's why... I think you're more just getting into international messiness.
7407161	7407921	Bullshit, though.
7407961	7408402	Seriously.
7408562	7409963	I think it's just international messiness.
7410103	7412044	I think somebody's pulling your leg over on GameFAQs.
7412124	7412785	I honestly do.
7412825	7413865	RIAA crap.
7413885	7425894	They lost the lawsuit with the MP3s and shit, so... I mean, because when you get into the international stuff, because Canada was upheld in court that the people sharing files were protected in Canada.
7426314	7430056	So if you're a Canadian user that downloaded off of DDRUK, you'll get off scot-free.
7430076	7432338	But if you're an American user, hey, you're going to be screwed.
7432955	7433235	I don't know.
7433396	7433676	Anyway.
7435478	7437660	Because it's the IPA, it's not the RIA.
7438060	7442364	Anyway, as I was mentioning, dancing character, I have to show Rob.
7442444	7444426	Obviously this is not good radio because you can't see it.
7445087	7447910	But this is something you would think I would have made.
7448170	7455177	But I didn't make it, so... So anyways...
7458092	7458552	Lovely.
7458732	7460412	Okay, a description for those at home.
7460713	7465694	Basically, somebody has created a DDR character for Stepmania that is a naked girl.
7465754	7466754	Well, a topless girl.
7467514	7473415	And her boobs in full glory, and wearing tight little panty bottoms or something she's got there.
7473735	7474575	Little skirt bottom.
7474935	7478496	What is the name of this character, and where can the little boys who want to masturbate to it down?
7478776	7479436	Oh, I love that!
7479596	7481877	Did you see on the upskirt cam, you could see her little...
7482987	7485089	Poonani on the little obscure cam, did you see that?
7485369	7488012	There was a little dark spot in the shape of a triangle.
7488272	7490514	Okay, where can the boys get this?
7491615	7497761	Well, it's been taken down due to, I guess, bandwidth issues.
7498342	7504048	But, it can be found...
7505317	7510519	There was a thread on DDR Freak in the sim file section that you could find this.
7511100	7528287	I luckily searched Google and in a cache page I found the link here, which I will later post to, I'll post the link in OrangeLodgeRadio.com where you can find it, which I'll upload to my site or something.
7529454	7535377	That was the first thing I noticed is that you could see her cootie box when it was going up the skirt there.
7537018	7539239	I can't believe you guys missed it.
7539779	7541940	Now Jamie's even got that curious look on her face.
7546663	7547123	Anyway.
7548064	7548904	That's ridiculous.
7549744	7551465	Where is my pantsless rage?
7552506	7553186	Seriously.
7553726	7555067	Where's our pantsless rage?
7555267	7556168	Our boy dancers.
7558209	7558549	Pervs.
7560168	7561549	So yeah, enough of that.
7562470	7564971	I don't remember where I got it, but some guy made it.
7565332	7578201	And I'm sure if you look over in, if you search for like black, oh is it Stepmania character, or it's like, I don't remember, it's just whatever they posted in the one thread.
7578881	7588848	I found it pretty easy, but I will post a link, it will be in our forums to where you can find the wonderful Stepmania character.
7590879	7594782	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7620134	7620974	I don't know what else to say.
7621495	7623355	You're still giggling over there, Explicit.
7623715	7628317	You're like a little 12-year-old boy who just saw boobies on the TV for the first time on HBO.
7629838	7631038	Dude, change to Channel 9.
7631079	7632159	It's a breast exam, girl.
7636421	7637781	Actually, this brings up a good topic.
7638201	7639482	I would like to go around the room.
7641163	7644224	You don't have to participate if you don't want to.
7644844	7648986	But I want to talk about the first time you ever saw the naughty bits of the opposite gender.
7655913	7656634	DarkSakura?
7662339	7668304	This is kind of embarrassing, but there was a kid I played with in my neighborhood and I was nine.
7668964	7671747	And he thought that one day it would be funny to pull down his pants.
7673688	7675630	And I told his mommy and got him spanked.
7680919	7681439	That's hot.
7681600	7682941	It was our next door neighbor.
7684402	7688045	This is when I used to run around carrying my gizmo everywhere.
7688305	7689266	My little gremlins doll.
7690226	7690987	Gizmo, huh?
7691307	7693289	You need to shut up, okay?
7694250	7700455	But seriously, that was my first exposure and I thought it was incredibly stupid.
7703617	7703937	Alright.
7704078	7708221	My mommy... My mom had no idea how to explain to me.
7708241	7709382	I was...
7711948	7716812	Anyway, Mel B. You guys don't have to participate.
7716832	7718093	I'm just talking to whoever's got the mic.
7718313	7720575	First time seeing live Naughty Bits, man.
7721556	7723937	I mean, okay, like, all media aside.
7725118	7725559	Gosh.
7727060	7727440	I don't know.
7727500	7734826	I think by the time I had, like, seen live ones, I'd been so desensitized by all the porn that my dad, like, hid underneath his bed and, like, in the cabinets.
7735366	7738028	It really wasn't anything new to me other than, like,
7738593	7740133	Okay, it's about time I saw this live.
7740153	7741374	You know, it's 3D and...
7742054	7742134	3D?!
7742154	7748036	Yeah, I mean, it was like... They didn't have any of that rad 70s porn with the glasses?
7749836	7754638	No, and there weren't any cool, like, you know, rainbows in the background or, like, you know, little stars flying around.
7754658	7766221	I mean, but... I guess it was a treat to see, like, you know, nice little shadows and, like, things just... Wow, there's texture to them and... Whoa, they're cold or... Wow, it's... It was...
7767959	7773262	Yeah, the first time I ever seen him was in my truck and it was in the back of the cab and it was a very cold night.
7774403	7775763	We had to keep each other warm somehow.
7778505	7779765	Anybody else care to go explicit?
7780626	7787349	If coming out of your mom's vagina counts... Not quite there, buddy.
7787369	7792752	Okay, I was one years old.
7793487	7796990	Okay, I don't even remember what the hell happened when I was one.
7797130	7799511	Okay, let's go the year when I was three years old.
7801593	7806717	Okay, I come to the bathroom, someone rushes to the shower, naked.
7806737	7810359	I was like, holy shit, what is this?
7810599	7811560	And what does hair grow down there?
7811580	7812561	Wow, this is getting interesting.
7812581	7814182	Okay.
7823410	7824811	Did I really want to bring up this topic?
7824891	7825231	I don't know.
7825271	7827593	Hey, you're the one who brought it.
7827633	7828013	You know what?
7828473	7831135	I dated girls in high school, and that's how I saw boobs.
7831515	7833797	Really, it wasn't any surprise.
7834057	7836339	Like Mel, you'd seen it on TV enough times.
7836379	7838420	It was just like, oh, now I've got them live and in person.
7839140	7840501	But really, sad enough.
7841482	7844264	But now, remember, ladies, I'm gay.
7845384	7850628	But the first time I saw the lower equator was actually at a strip bar.
7852318	7852838	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7873120	7873640	This is easy.
7875562	7878184	I assume this is the first time live.
7878645	7880286	It was 6th grade.
7880366	7891095	They were doing presentations in my class for... We were studying Roman history or something like that.
7891175	7892116	No, it wasn't Roman history.
7892136	7892677	We were reading...
7894969	7900753	No, we were reading, like, I want to say it was like, not Julius Caesar, no.
7902834	7903974	Something to do with Greek and Romans.
7903995	7905635	We were studying, like, history or something.
7906296	7911639	And there was a presentation being done in the class, and, you know, people were dressing up for the part.
7911739	7924567	Well, this one chick, she wasn't too smart, so she didn't wear anything underneath it, and she was up on a chair, like, reciting something, and she got down off the chair, stepped on her toga, and the whole thing just came off.
7929105	7930106	All in front of the class.
7932848	7933748	How educational.
7934269	7934649	It was.
7938952	7939292	Awesome.
7940353	7940733	Alright.
7941874	7944115	Oh yeah, we're supposed to talk about games on this show.
7944195	7945036	I'm sorry.
7945136	7945776	I'm so sorry.
7947818	7949159	Games that little kids play.
7951921	7952281	Alright.
7952614	7953774	Let's go to a break, guys.
7954014	7956095	When we come back from the break, we're going to do the FUs of the week.
7956115	7960316	We're going to talk about who won the cage match and who knows, whatever else we feel like.
7960877	7964058	We're going to do whatever the hell we please, basically, here on Orange Lounge Radio.
7964518	7965758	So you just be ready for it.
7966919	7968539	We'll be back after this.
7969379	7973621	I decided we'd do a break of some DDR songs, some pretty well-known DDR songs.
7973961	7977382	And just for Jamie, I made the first song by Taku.
7978478	7979821	and it's one we haven't played in a while.
7980182	7982587	So starting it off we have Era starting off this mix.
7983028	7983429	We'll be back.
8032456	8033417	Thanks for watching!
8083696	8085058	Thanks for watching!
8196449	8197770	Thanks for watching!
8299659	8308285	Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.
8314189	8316550	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
8316590	8317871	Thank you guys for sticking with us.
8317911	8319612	We're getting into the last hour of the show here.
8319652	8323815	We have plenty of stuff coming up, including some favorite segments you've come to know and love.
8324355	8328078	We've got to get one of those segments taken care of, though, and that would be the cage match.
8328138	8329719	You guys want to know who won tonight's cage match?
8331520	8333101	I have to give props to the chat room.
8333121	8335362	A lot of people voting tonight's cage match.
8335463	8338044	Very pleased to see a lot of participation from the chat room tonight.
8338344	8339065	And you know what?
8339385	8346890	Once again, one vote separating not only the winner from the second place song, but from the third place song as well.
8346910	8349132	It was that freaking close tonight.
8349592	8350272	So here it is.
8350633	8353875	The winning song of tonight's cage match is...
8358276	8360637	Echo Image with Endless Day.
8362117	8363197	One more time.
8364738	8366038	Very, very close.
8366218	8368799	One vote, any other direction would have made all the difference.
8369059	8370379	So, very nice.
8370819	8372160	Thank you for participating, you guys.
8373020	8374300	And we'll do it again next week.
8375060	8375380	All right.
8376781	8377221	Moving on.
8379161	8381682	You know, we're kind of getting into the last hour of the show.
8381722	8385524	We really only have, what, FUs, Ask Orange Lounge, Left to Go, right?
8385544	8386604	You know, the usual bits.
8387024	8399229	Well, we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we get bored and we're looking for things to talk about on the show because, you know, if we don't talk about DDR, there'll be people out there that go, Man, that Orange Lounge Radio sucks!
8401360	8403722	They don't ever talk about DDR.
8403762	8407304	They talk about the first time they saw boobs or penises.
8408084	8409205	They're all gay.
8410085	8411106	What's wrong with them?
8411426	8415488	And you know, chat room, you're really missing something without being able to see Rob's face while he does this.
8417049	8418370	Well, I can talk about both at once.
8418710	8421071	Man, everybody at Orange Lounge Radio is gay.
8421391	8423212	It's a big gay station.
8423272	8424733	Everything about it is gay.
8425794	8426574	You mean unhappy?
8426594	8426674	Yeah.
8431368	8432829	Where is that rainbow cake, man?
8433450	8435472	Oh, how fruity.
8435812	8443839	In an effort to warm ourselves up more to the DDR community, we seek inspiration from posts from DDR Freak.
8446060	8447381	Oh, God, no.
8448943	8449663	That's right.
8450604	8453647	It's time for the DDR Chit Chat Post of the Week.
8454027	8454768	Oh, my God.
8458280	8465624	Since we are syndicated now on DDR Freak Radio, we've got to give a shout out to our fellow friends over at DDR Freak.
8466565	8471908	We're working together with the Freak by stealing one of their topics for one of our own.
8471968	8475330	So here it is, the DDR topic of the week.
8476951	8479672	Here it is, guys, and you all are going to have to answer this.
8480012	8480373	Here it is.
8481673	8483054	Subject of message.
8484215	8486276	What are tournaments like?
8488311	8493174	Hell on Earth Hell on Earth And you don't eat all day Now we're talking about DDR tournaments
8508911	8510412	And I'm talking about DDR tournaments too.
8511533	8512134	Now wait a minute though.
8512154	8517979	There was the one tournament we had in Sacramento where Lanky Style and Rice Princess were running the kitchen with deep fried Twinkies.
8519200	8520041	I had half of one.
8520421	8521642	So you did get to eat that day.
8522263	8523684	That's all I needed to eat all day.
8526246	8526886	Explicit.
8527347	8528768	What are DDR tournaments like?
8529269	8532071	Heaven or hell.
8532091	8535314	The good thing about tournaments is of course you get to meet with a lot of people.
8536320	8541883	Chitchat and compete so you can feel welcome to see how your skills match up with others.
8542523	8544885	Are you better than everybody else or not?
8545845	8547866	Some tournaments actually serve food.
8548347	8551368	The upcoming tournament I'm organizing called Sacktown Smackdown.
8551588	8552429	Not piss!
8553489	8554450	We don't need to go back there.
8555450	8556271	I'll talk to you about that.
8557031	8558292	Talk to Mel about it another time.
8558332	8559993	I'm not bringing that subject back up this week.
8561554	8562354	Okay, okay.
8562374	8563074	Back on topic.
8563735	8565796	The tournament is to meet the organizers
8568071	8572893	and for those who are lonely, they can visit the opposite sex if that's possible.
8574293	8577034	Okay, as for the hell part, this is where I get cranky.
8577694	8580075	People bitch about the fucking pads.
8580615	8582516	Oh wow, a pair doesn't work.
8584076	8585757	Well, that's too bad.
8586698	8589120	We only say that if it doesn't work immediately.
8589160	8592922	You can't have it step up no matter how many pounds of pressure you put on it.
8593723	8597566	But I've seen people complain because they tap it very loudly and get a miss.
8598186	8599187	Oh wow, you got a miss.
8599307	8599727	So what?
8600067	8600748	Focus more.
8600788	8601568	Don't give up.
8602849	8605571	Oh my god, you screwed me over on the fucking tournament.
8605831	8606972	Or complain about the rules.
8608193	8612056	And of course, you get the butt-raping drama that's been going around and shit.
8612981	8614662	Ooh, NorCal versus SoCal.
8615442	8617763	Oh wow, what big of a deal is this?
8617783	8619064	Seattle versus everybody.
8619644	8621605	NorCal versus SoCal ain't no rivalry, man.
8621625	8622646	Especially in freestyle.
8622886	8624307	That's a one-sided ass-whooping.
8624327	8625107	That ain't a rivalry.
8625667	8627508	Oh dear, oh dear, he's starting something.
8627809	8630390	Okay, that's what I'm getting to in the freestyle section.
8630430	8633391	You know, freestyle is always about the opinions.
8633852	8641295	You can't complain and say you deserve first place or second place unless you've got something that's determined that's favoring one side or the other.
8641715	8642576	If that is the case...
8643069	8644270	They shouldn't even be judges.
8644690	8647873	Of course, Mel B knows what kind of tournaments those have been.
8649554	8651856	Alright, Mel B. I gotta ask Mel B, though.
8652076	8658442	I'll continue to address to Mel B. Okay, Mel B, because you've won a couple tournaments, and you've had a hand in judging and putting together some.
8658982	8659903	What are tournaments like?
8660163	8660664	Payday.
8665287	8667950	It's Mel Ego B, everybody!
8668770	8671973	As far as I'm concerned, there's two things that I know when I have a good tourney.
8672372	8675474	I come out paid, and when I'm done back home, there are panties on my drawer.
8679516	8682437	I don't know, it's kind of hard to say.
8682837	8687940	Obviously, if we're going back about five years ago, tournaments were a big thing.
8688560	8692703	We were trying to promote the game, we were trying to get people aware of this.
8694472	8695973	No, I mean, we took tournaments seriously.
8696013	8702576	We figured, you know, we had to put our best foot forward to make this game look good and say like, hey, this is something everyone can enjoy and all that good stuff.
8702776	8704677	And so it was sort of fun.
8704717	8706798	But when I got to my first tournament, I won.
8706838	8710320	And like by that, I think that just kind of like maybe see tournaments a whole different way.
8710340	8711780	Like I had to go out there and I had to win.
8711840	8716082	I wasn't out there to, I mean, yeah, I was out there to have fun and, you know, socialize and promote it.
8716122	8722285	But when all was said and done, I didn't drive down five hours to LA to be second place or to be, you know, to have a good show.
8722485	8723066	Oh, snap.
8723086	8723666	Screw that.
8724093	8748637	but um so yeah after all you know tourneys you know yeah I got bigger prizes got my solo machine got my poppin music controller at the last tourney which is pretty dope by the way thank you desktop arcade um I would say as far as organizing a tourney those things are not fun yeah organizers are not that great I think perfect tech tourneys are fucking boring as hell because it's I mean it's
8750227	8779431	yeah there's just basically nothing new you can put to PA I mean yeah you can put on different modifiers but then it's like you're not really gauging someone's perfect attack ability you're gauging their improv you know their sight reading more or less which is not a bad thing I mean it's something that should be tested but at the same time it's kind of just kind of gone to the wayside it's boring in my opinion at least with freestyle there's that chance you can see something new and something cool but tournaments are pretty fun if you just don't hang around the venue too long
8781496	8791240	DDR Tournaments for me, DDR Tournaments for me are about bringing a lot of Febreze and a super soaker to give some of these kids a bath.
8792300	8792820	No, I'm kidding.
8793320	8793821	Actually, I'm not.
8793861	8802584	But, you know, DDR Tournaments, it's all about community to me, and I could give a shit about who's winning the tournament, and I've participated in tournaments, and I've lost big.
8802904	8805465	I've done decent in some as well, but...
8806337	8811919	To me, yes, to me it's about making people know who I am.
8814280	8821683	And I'll tell you what, after the March Madness where we had DDR Idol, you know who I am.
8825806	8828249	It's about making your DDR penis as big as possible.
8828269	8830872	We need to do DDR Idol again.
8830912	8834856	Are you actually going to come back?
8834896	8836318	The good doctor's thinking about it.
8836338	8839001	You just need something to get him out of the closet again.
8840242	8845548	Remember in my tournament, you get to improv with a prop.
8847672	8848092	Think about it.
8848252	8850593	That's a new thing I'm putting up for freestyle.
8850673	8851333	Sounds pretty hot.
8851353	8853213	Improvision with a prop.
8853793	8855114	I'll talk to the good doctor about it.
8855134	8855954	We'll see what he comes up with.
8856054	8863215	Or you're probably saving up for DDR History X. I don't want to beat the Dr. Dick thing into the ground, though.
8864116	8865416	I'm only going to use him on a rainy day.
8865916	8867356	How can you not?
8869257	8869637	We'll see.
8869697	8870037	We'll see.
8870617	8870897	All right.
8871617	8873438	Shark Scroll, anything you wanted to add to this discussion?
8874218	8875298	What is a tournament like?
8875888	8876088	Yes.
8876308	8876769	Okay.
8877169	8878010	Find my friends.
8878110	8879110	Jabber, jabber, jabber.
8879170	8880051	Have they started yet?
8880491	8881212	Jabber, jabber, jabber.
8881252	8881652	Another hour.
8881692	8882653	Have they started yet?
8882773	8883634	Jabber, jabber, jabber.
8884254	8885095	Oh, there's a routine.
8885135	8885655	Who's on?
8886336	8887437	Oh, we just missed the entire thing.
8887517	8887737	Oh, well.
8888718	8889078	That's it.
8890579	8894302	And most of the time it involves doing something completely unrelated to DDR, like actually mini-golfing.
8894482	8898084	By the way, SharkScroll and I met for the first time at a DDR tournament.
8899365	8900346	Just jabber, jabber, jabber.
8900766	8901207	That's right.
8901227	8904009	Because DarkSakura and I were pissed that we screwed up on PA.
8904759	8908140	No, I met you before the PA, because I remember you guys went to go get the bats.
8908921	8910381	Yeah!
8910481	8911401	And the toy horns.
8911501	8916043	But I remember we screwed up on PA so bad, and we got your input on what we should do for the freestyle.
8916063	8925046	And then, like, me, DarkSakura, IguanaGirl, I remember we all went to the Rite Aid, and we got the bats, and we did the Stomp to My Beat routine, which was the best routine I was ever a part of, by the way.
8926387	8930708	Now, the funny thing is, I remember when I met you, and I know I've told you this, but I'll tell the entire world this.
8931008	8932889	My first two thoughts when I met Rob...
8933416	8934337	Wow, he's hot.
8934637	8935578	Wow, he's gay.
8936478	8938700	In that order, at that speed.
8938800	8939240	Thank you.
8940141	8940761	Thank you, honey.
8946005	8946605	I'm blushing.
8947706	8948207	Stop, girl.
8948567	8950828	See, this is about tournaments being good for my ego.
8951289	8953951	Anyway, Loki, anything you want to add about DDR tournaments?
8957893	8961476	Well, they're long and boring.
8963638	8964878	Yeah, that's my take on them.
8965819	8969440	They're like, um, watching Titanic.
8971580	8986765	It's like you keep expecting something, you keep expecting something cool to happen, and someone says that there's something really good about it, but you just don't see it no matter how long you watch it, and after you're done, you want your three hours back.
8986865	8989146	So that's pretty much, you know...
8991480	9000102	Oh, and you know, you expect something major to happen, like Leonardo DiCaprio to die, but then you find out he just was acting, so.
9002923	9005103	And then, you know, we're all shocked to find out the boat sinks.
9005864	9006404	Oh my!
9007744	9009244	Thank you for ruining it for me, Rob!
9009264	9014206	Something completely unexpected happens, like the same people winning the tournaments all the time.
9014826	9016066	That's wonderful.
9018527	9019027	That's all right.
9020188	9021528	The doctor's going to make a comeback.
9021568	9022149	Just you wait.
9023549	9023870	All right.
9023950	9025550	Anyway, let's move on.
9026051	9028532	So that was our DDR Freak post of the week.
9028752	9029252	There you have it.
9029352	9031833	Our DDR Chit Chat post of the week.
9031973	9034635	Keep posting over in DDR Freak on the DDR Chit Chat boards.
9034975	9041138	Your post, if it's interesting enough, could be fodder for this show.
9041378	9041638	All right.
9042096	9047178	Moving on, let's get into the FUs of the week.
9047618	9051319	Jamie, why is it that we have to do these FUs every single week?
9051480	9054000	Because life is a big stinking pile of shit.
9055121	9060463	Oh, this is bad.
9062184	9062964	Here is justice.
9070365	9074328	An FU goes toward the entirety of my week since Wednesday.
9075168	9078310	For getting three hours of sleep in as many days.
9080671	9083633	For being an emotional wreck for the past few days.
9085094	9089477	An FU to basically almost having to go find my own damn apartment.
9091878	9097262	To being harassed by the cops at Denny's over an open confrontation.
9097282	9099143	To your wife.
9101185	9101725	It's not funny.
9102365	9103065	It's really serious.
9104386	9113030	Um... Just F you to all that, and having to compromise for a worthy cause.
9114431	9115491	That's it, that's all I'm gonna say.
9116972	9120233	Alright, then we'll move on to... Loki!
9123355	9127997	First off, thank you to myself for having to buy another fucking hard drive for this goddamn computer.
9128615	9138583	Because I didn't calculate the voltage needed for these things, so... You know, one rail of the power supply would've been maxed out if I bought these other things.
9138684	9143588	Basically, you plug in a USB anything and the computer crashes, so that would've sucked.
9144208	9150934	But, I got a larger hard drive out of it, now I have this really small 30 gig laptop hard drive that... I have no fucking clue what I'm gonna do with.
9151735	9156879	And, um, fuck you, those goddamn slow people in front of me today while I was coming home.
9157628	9162671	You were literally driving like 20 miles an hour in 50 mile an hour area.
9163432	9164773	I drive by you and guess what?
9164793	9165273	You're old.
9165733	9166534	There's a shocker.
9167935	9175340	Seriously, honestly, driving slower will not get you, will not let you live longer, basically.
9175640	9177241	You cannot slow down time.
9178101	9180903	So please, drive the speed limit or faster.
9181464	9182164	May I add one?
9183185	9183345	F.U.
9183385	9184886	people with halogen headlights, thank you.
9185493	9187135	Oh yes, I'd like to second that.
9187515	9192919	Nothing that I like more than having the sun staring at me through my back window.
9193440	9201647	You know, because I'm glad you can see five miles in front of you, but I can't even see two feet in front of me because your lights are burning my retinas.
9202227	9206671	I'm sorry, but, you know, I fucking hate all these trucks with, like, fog lamps and shit on them.
9207192	9210715	They have so much, you know, fucking light coming out of them, I literally...
9211596	9216762	I can see them cutting a hole in the fog, you know, literally just evaporating right in front of them.
9218124	9218744	It's just nuts.
9219065	9222969	No wonder deers fucking, you know, get hit by cars because they stare through the headlights.
9223250	9224591	They, like, literally go blind.
9225032	9226854	They're just, like, brain shocked.
9228513	9229554	So that fucking sucked.
9230355	9235819	And just basically, you know, fuck you to this stupid Dremel attachment that I have.
9235859	9244146	This little flex shaft thing that supposedly allows you to use a Dremel tool in really tight places and stuff.
9244386	9251633	But the goddamn thing, you know, I put the bit inside of it and it threw the goddamn saw blade out at me, so that sucked.
9255103	9258926	I don't want to hear any of your giggling over a flex shaft in tight places.
9262108	9263109	The hell with you people.
9264751	9268774	You're saying about talking about putting things in tight places in this crowd.
9271701	9272061	I know.
9272101	9273722	That sounds like fun, girl.
9275242	9284105	And a Final Fantasy-related FU to this guy named Warchief, who is a complete moron, who I literally think is retarded and doesn't speak English.
9284905	9287766	So, way to go, retarded people.
9288046	9288566	Dark!
9288886	9290386	Final Fantasy fun!
9291047	9294828	So, um... Yay.
9295688	9296988	So, to hell with all that.
9297528	9299729	Yeah, really, it's been a pretty decent week, though.
9301721	9302021	I'm done.
9310268	9317513	An FU to my mouse that just decided to die on me so I can't control the show right now except with the keyboard.
9317913	9320355	So this is going to be an interesting second half of the show.
9320675	9324098	I've just got to go run and get the spare battery so I've got to keep my FUs kind of short.
9325459	9327781	FU to the Valero that just opened up.
9328882	9330082	Literally across the street.
9330142	9332724	I don't know if you noticed, they've been building a gas station across the street.
9333144	9337467	Just to set this up, the Orange Lounge Studios are in the middle of fucking nowhere, okay?
9337567	9340628	And they just finally built a gas station, like, literally right across the street from us.
9340969	9342289	But now it has a mini-mart.
9342630	9346032	And of course these mini-marts are gonna be freaking marked up to all hell.
9346492	9347893	But it's so convenient!
9348393	9353716	So now I'm gonna end up paying, like, $5 for a 12-pack of Pepsi because, well, shit, it's right across the street.
9354196	9354857	And I'm lazy.
9356894	9357675	Alright, alright.
9357695	9360918	Continue from the previous weeks that I've not been saying FU's.
9378997	9383922	A big F you goes to almost everybody who keeps calling my god damn tournament Piss.
9385504	9389908	Just cause some people spelled it Paradise Island, Sacktown, Smackdown.
9391050	9392671	It doesn't mean it is called Piss.
9392731	9394373	Just call it Sacktown Smackdown.
9396775	9398637	Since when did we have a Piss attack?
9400319	9401000	I'm on a perfect...
9401696	9407681	I don't know, the first Sacramento attorney I remember was called Scat, so... That was not my idea.
9409944	9420333	But, on an odd enough note, I actually found two of the Scat t-shirts in my closet while looking for stuff, so maybe we'll throw it out as a prize.
9423035	9424437	T-shirts from the bottom of my closet.
9424477	9425798	The mouse is fixed, thank you.
9427799	9435105	Another F he goes to, someone's throwing a fucking glass, a fucking, um, slowly bottle in the fucking road again.
9435625	9436626	What am I supposed to do?
9439488	9446213	Don't fucking F. I drive, I drive back and forth every day and I see someone throw a damn bottle out of nowhere.
9446854	9448295	Who the hell do you think you are?
9448615	9451617	This is $1,000 fine if you throw anything out the window.
9451657	9452178	If you get caught.
9456997	9464421	Yeah, if you get caught, but it's because the cops are so lazy eating their fucking 12 donuts or Krispy Kreme donuts.
9466142	9470505	Hey, now, don't be getting mad at cops for eating donuts.
9470585	9472726	They have to have breakfast just like you and me.
9473146	9478710	And goddammit, if they decide to frequent a donut place, then that's their god-given right.
9482510	9485815	I'm not going to go with the freaking donut issue.
9485895	9489821	I've seen a cop... It's donut's fault for being so goddamn delicious.
9491043	9492725	And it's too damn round as well.
9494535	9519015	I'm not gonna go, okay, uh, let me see, another F he goes to DDRUK for shutting down, of course, he's got people trying to spy over MP3s and shit, but like I stated earlier, I said, we can always find our counter lawsuit for, for bargaining our privacy and shit, so, all is forgiven, and if not really, we beat that shit out of him,
9520714	9520934	Mel B!
9536630	9548359	Oh gosh, well, after you go to my, uh, workplace over at Navco, real smooth to have a QA department of about, oh, about maybe 60 strong or so, and have, like, six computers for all of us to use.
9548459	9552242	Especially when we're trying to bug, like, a really, uh, big project here.
9552842	9554223	Do you have Katamari Stress Balls?
9554243	9554363	Maybe...
9584093	9593658	Yeah, I'm actually, funny enough, one of the people who I know at Namco, just transferred from Konami, works in the marketing division, so I'm going to try to see if she can be my hookup for stuff.
9594139	9597580	And she's Japanese, too, so that's a double-plot.
9598321	9603544	I did find out that for the LucasArts people, they get thermal nuclear detonator shuffles.
9604264	9608226	Oh, yeah, so, yeah, happy to them.
9608486	9609087	Happy to...
9609980	9612921	Thank you to myself for losing my damn keys on Friday night.
9613141	9617202	Apparently what happened was it ended up in Shark's girl's handbag somehow.
9617222	9619603	I don't know if she had a hand in this.
9619883	9621923	I swear to you, I had the bag on your chair.
9621943	9625404	You threw the keys on the chair when you walked in the door and it fell in my bag.
9625424	9627745	Wait, you're the responsible one.
9627765	9630246	You should know what you're saying.
9630326	9634047	So yeah, thank you to myself for just losing my keys like I always do.
9634087	9635767	Thank God I actually found it.
9636267	9638028	But that's about it.
9638655	9640196	Life is actually alright otherwise.
9641557	9642217	Sharksgirl.
9643438	9644979	I don't really have anything.
9645059	9646120	I'm feeling pretty mellow.
9647841	9649001	F you to not being happy.
9649161	9650082	Or not being angsty.
9650242	9651563	F you to being happy and not being angsty.
9652724	9656086	F you to you for giving me an F you.
9656646	9657506	That's what I was looking for.
9659127	9660008	Nelly, any F yous?
9661226	9663747	Thank you for ruining an entire continuity that I grew up with.
9663967	9664827	I want my $8 back.
9664867	9665287	Exactly.
9691634	9693735	Star Wars was my first movie ever.
9694476	9697837	I was one and my mom drug me screaming to the movie theater.
9698197	9700639	However, I would be quiet whenever Darth Vader was on the screen.
9700779	9704901	That would show that I was meant to have a life of evil.
9708443	9709903	Just screw him.
9710904	9713265	He's messed with my childhood.
9714365	9716286	But he did cast Natalie Portman in his movies.
9718327	9719328	I'm gay and I'd hit that.
9721226	9724067	And she's one of five people in that movie who have any talent.
9726227	9726748	Very true.
9728208	9728488	Alright.
9729068	9729808	Now, now, man.
9729848	9730689	Chewbacca.
9731669	9732009	That's Oscar.
9732049	9733909	I'm looking forward to seeing the Wookiee planet, though.
9735470	9735970	Oh, God.
9736190	9737670	They get out of the ship.
9738271	9739471	What the hell's going on?
9739491	9739531	Oh!
9741004	9745046	Dark Knight says, F you to cold weather and ice.
9772045	9777550	Peralta says, F you to the people who hate my little Euro car with the bright halogen lights.
9777810	9778931	Actually, he didn't say halogen lights.
9778971	9780973	I threw that in there, but I'm assuming that's what he's referencing.
9783315	9786298	He also says, F you to the mess I woke up to this morning.
9786959	9789661	The gays left the house so much cleaner than it was before.
9789801	9790882	Clara from Drawn Together.
9794165	9794746	Raichan says,
9795313	9798776	says, F you to being emotionally stupid the other night.
9799196	9801238	F you to my mom being a total bitch yesterday.
9801318	9807083	And Joyce says, F you to horny guys that think they can have ass sex with me while I'm trying to dance.
9808644	9812368	F you to potholes for trying to mess up my lowered truck.
9814089	9820915	Big Red Pimp, Ohio Bomani, says, F you to being too broke to buy a para para para controller so I can make drivers for Stepmania.
9822566	9826007	Zerus says, a big F you to not playing My Baby Daddy sooner.
9826407	9829067	Oh, keep on talking, we ain't gonna play that song, you don't have that attitude.
9829528	9834729	Jaded2005 says, F you to the person who's requesting My Baby Mama, cause it sucks.
9835149	9836949	Well, that was comic timing.
9838249	9842330	DJ Ranma S says, F you to the fucktards on my job for stealing.
9842770	9844891	You're making it worse on the entire store.
9846618	9851021	Seperoff, 1215, says F you to Thursday for no inside the box.
9851242	9852282	It's actually outside the box.
9852703	9855825	And F you to the Blizzard for ruining my weekend and DDR playing.
9856746	9857907	Well, real life got in the way.
9857927	9858407	What can I say?
9858947	9862730	Illusion says F you to this weekend being so goddamn boring.
9863131	9874339	Although Friday was hella, yes, I said hella, fun because Denny's plus karaoke to Love Shack with my friend Amanda and getting a standing ovation from a crowd of drunken Mexicans that couldn't understand what I was even saying.
9874839	9875340	Dot, dot, dot.
9876491	9879933	and FU to close your eyes by day behavior being impossible to find.
9882414	9891318	Phoenix says FU to death, FU for me missing the first part of Orange Lounge Radio and no FU to Jamie because she is the bestest and pretty damn hot too.
9893139	9894419	You go girl, you got a fan.
9895239	9895720	My heart.
9897781	9898901	I have a stalker.
9900082	9901542	I want a stalker, no fair.
9902363	9902403	K-6
9903482	9908185	says F you to myself for getting mad, yelling at my boss, and getting fired this past week.
9910486	9919832	On behalf of Orange Lounge Radio, don't!
9919852	9922213	There's plenty of McDonald's jobs out there, don't worry.
9922894	9924295	That's refreshing news, I'm sure.
9924375	9924675	All right.
9926095	9932917	Seriously, you need to get a job at Rayleigh's Chinese Food Place because the goddamn people that work there can't fucking speak English.
9934297	9938038	It would be a relief to... Oh my god, I gotta go into this later.
9938238	9939079	Okay, later on.
9939479	9941119	After this, you're done reading these.
9943160	9950042	SSJ100Matt says, Big FU for Dell Indian Tech Support trying to get me to reformat my PC when I didn't need to.
9950562	9953263	Also, FU to Expedia.com screwing me out of $180. $180.
9955495	9960757	Mikolatov says, F you to Konami for making me come up with passcodes for a free sweet code in Forswag.
9961257	9964739	I fucking hate slide puzzles, so of course I had to do one to get a code.
9964779	9968920	And F you to Final Fantasy XI for making Black Mage artifact armor so hard to get.
9969020	9970001	Damn you, Squeenix.
9971481	9974843	DDR Angel says, F you to the garrison run on Final Fantasy XI.
9975163	9976263	It was hard to stay alive.
9976403	9979725	I made it, and it was fun to have a new experience and game with an 18-person alliance.
9979785	9981786	But F you to it being difficult and disorienting.
9981866	9982126	Done.
9982246	9982546	Bye.
9984967	9985087	Um...
9986599	9989620	Islander says, F you to everyone hating on my baby daddy.
9990600	9991120	Word.
9991300	9993000	Zerus says, another F you.
9993080	9996341	My name is pronounced Zerious.
9997041	9997601	Oh, my bad.
9998462	9999722	Like serious, but Zerious.
10000922	10001562	My bad.
10001862	10002382	I'm white.
10002482	10002803	Sorry.
10003363	10004823	Dork says, F you to work.
10004883	10006543	Because of it, I almost got shot.
10008464	10009484	And Zaku says...
10011091	10015233	F you to the sky taking a shit on the east coast in the form of snow this weekend.
10015293	10016254	At least it's not yellow snow.
10016794	10019575	F you to the current school semester with a shitty GPA.
10020096	10022877	And F you to being laid off from my current job on Friday.
10023157	10023497	What's up?
10028660	10030941	I can't pronounce this guy's name right no matter what.
10032602	10033082	Zyrus.
10036966	10037748	I'm getting yelled at.
10040113	10042719	Flynn says, F you to PCs, Max Rock.
10044703	10045905	Oh, you got a cheer there from...
10047282	10052464	Actually, I do have to say that I'm considering getting a Mac after they get cheaper for one reason.
10052804	10053285	Mac Mini.
10053325	10057326	I want the Mac Mini to build a countertop main machine out of.
10057346	10060188	There's a lot of people that are considering using Mac Minis for other things.
10060488	10060848	Yeah.
10061048	10064049	I wouldn't use it to actually, you know, use it for a computer.
10065030	10067131	I want the laptops to come down to those kinds of prices.
10067511	10071113	Except since a lot of my major is now graphic arts and taught in the Mac Lab.
10073734	10074034	Alright.
10075735	10076615	And I think that's
10077456	10082162	Thank you guys for participating in tonight's FUs of the Week.
10091381	10094983	F you to my cable modem and CD DVD drives for being out.
10095243	10097404	Can still get on AIM via my cell at least.
10097844	10099224	But she's unable to listen to the show.
10099385	10100745	I actually had another one to add.
10100765	10101906	This is just laughable.
10102326	10108248	How many people, my orientation for my Photoshop class was, it's an online class, was taught in the Mac Lab.
10108829	10112890	And it was amazing that half the people were saying, how do I get on to the blackboard?
10113150	10115271	Because they didn't know where to find Internet Explorer.
10117032	10118333	I just laughed.
10122033	10124735	I laughed for a very long time.
10124795	10130441	My first computer was one of those old Apple 2E tall ones.
10131161	10134104	It's like, this thing's taller than my head.
10135245	10139209	Along the playing, where in the world is Carmen Sandiego on those things?
10140611	10147175	As I was going to say before about the retarded people at the Chinese food place, there was actually someone that was more retarded than the sample lady.
10147675	10160121	And that was this person, I don't even know who she was, she wasn't even Asian, but I was like, I want the large rice plate, as advertised in this little thing here where it's $4.99.
10160601	10162241	So what she does, she starts going for the chow mein.
10162262	10165263	I'm like, large rice plate, not chow mein!
10166184	10167685	You know, and so she's like, oh!
10168186	10177514	Okay, so she gets the rice, and then she doesn't know what she's doing, she keeps asking the Asian people, and they're just like, looking at her funny, like, you don't understand?
10178314	10179174	You stupid!
10179835	10182796	So anyways, I finally got my stuff, but man, she was a retard.
10184156	10206905	And the other thing I was going to mention, which is kind of cool, in two weeks I get to go see the Kings play, even though I'm not a Kings fan, but I won floor tickets to the Kings, and I honestly, I hate the Kings, but we're watching them play the Knicks, and I'm taking my mom because she likes the Kings, and whatever, so...
10207546	10208748	I get to go sit on the floor.
10210830	10214635	Yeah, I hope something cool happens like a meteor hits them and kills them all.
10215156	10216097	Because that'd be cool.
10216778	10218540	Or if one of them has a heart attack or something.
10218560	10220482	I should bring marbles.
10222345	10226530	Yeah, if I want to die...
10228789	10233170	All right, we're going to go to a quick break, and when we come back, a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge.
10233230	10237111	We have a little bit of time for Ask Orange Lounge, or you could ask Mel B, Shark's Girl, or Explicit.
10237951	10239071	Maybe you could ask Nellie.
10239111	10240051	That doesn't mean she'll answer you.
10240492	10244653	You can ask... I'm going to ask Nellie.
10245093	10245693	No, never mind.
10246673	10247273	All right, anyway.
10247653	10249894	How much money would it take for you to rape Robin?
10250714	10251234	All right.
10251956	10255500	Ask Orange Lounge when we come back for a little bit, and then we're going to put the nail in the coffin of this show.
10255821	10261948	In this break, we're going to do a two-song break featuring some requests, some songs that you guys have been requesting all night long.
10261988	10262428	Here you go.
10262688	10264571	We're going to start it off with a little bit of a ballad.
10265552	10268415	So get out the lighters and slow dance to this one.
10282934	10283635	Thank you.
10283655	10284095	Thank you.
10307967	10308668	Thanks for watching!
10348924	10349587	Thanks for watching!
10383001	10384122	Thank you for watching!
10461445	10467251	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
10472015	10474898	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
10478061	10482606	And I was going to do Ask Orange Lounge, but nobody submitted a question yet.
10482966	10484167	I have a question.
10484227	10485588	Hold on, we've got to do the music.
10485628	10486089	Just a minute here.
10492506	10496188	Okay, I just put it there in chat, a reminder of how to ask Orange Lounge if you would like.
10496208	10498509	Yeah, ask us a question, bitches.
10498569	10505072	But since we don't have any questions yet, what we'll do is we'll allow somebody in the room to ask other folks in the room a question.
10505152	10507353	So let me get the theme music so we can play.
10510094	10510514	Here we go.
10514076	10514516	Here we go.
10517731	10520673	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
10521173	10524395	What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
10524815	10526316	Will you rape me in a bus?
10526676	10528197	Will you rape me in a car?
10528557	10530058	Will you... Fuck it.
10540003	10541624	Peralta has a question.
10541984	10544806	When will you report on Tony Hawk's latest game?
10546730	10548571	When monkeys fly out of my ass.
10548591	10552454	When one magically appears on the hard drive of my HD loader.
10552774	10559018	I need to play The Punisher because you can kill people in hundreds of different ways.
10571761	10581223	including like taking their jaw, opening it up on a curb and smashing their skull down or throwing them through wood chippers or drill presses or like many other ways.
10581283	10588045	You can interrogate them over a roof by dangling them by their feet and then you can let them go and like a bunch of other fun stuff like that.
10588465	10589865	It's like super violent and stuff.
10591446	10592826	Someone's played my favorite game already.
10593226	10594906	Peralta has a follow-up question.
10595707	10597727	When will monkeys be flying out of Jamie's ass?
10599328	10600088	Hopefully never.
10602475	10610640	Alright, uh, Zerus says, why do so many people hate on my baby, insert parent figure here, my baby mama or my baby daddy?
10611780	10617123	I don't hate it, I just think we do play that song an awful lot, we're supposed to, you know, that's supposed to be a rainy day song.
10617403	10624527	We need to do the more politically correct version, you know, uh, my baby non-gender specific parental unit.
10626409	10627349	My baby parent.
10628190	10628990	My baby guardian.
10630638	10634420	I've been reading a lot of those politically correct bedtime stories, those little books.
10636181	10641883	And so, I was actually spending the other day trying to filk songs to do them politically correct.
10642783	10643184	It didn't work.
10643204	10645004	Why does my baby have two mamas?
10645785	10648466	My baby mamas?
10649403	10650243	My baby mamas.
10651183	10651563	Alright.
10652264	10655704	I'm going to kind of tear through these because suddenly we're getting like eight questions.
10655764	10656204	It's crazy.
10656224	10658485	So I've got to burn through these because we've only got a little show left here.
10658965	10662045	K- wants to know, what is the best way to pick up chicks?
10663546	10664446	Show them your wallet.
10665666	10667046	Lift them by the shoulders.
10667346	10667926	A backhoe.
10669887	10671467	Tell them you're a great freestyler.
10671647	10675208	Well, when he says chicks, he means chicks at DDR Tourneys.
10675648	10676948	Again, show them your wallet.
10677890	10680772	Okay, unless they're competing, they're usually there to watch their boyfriends.
10681652	10683353	Is there a barnyard at tournaments?
10683413	10684133	Little chicks?
10684494	10686615	Cheep, cheep, cheep, ha, ha, ha.
10686695	10687275	Boo!
10688095	10690837	Just kidding.
10691617	10692918	Do I have any serious advice?
10693198	10693678	You know what?
10695960	10697040	Just go up and say hi.
10697260	10698881	Girls are impressed with a guy with balls.
10699121	10699962	Just go up and say hi.
10700842	10702283	Don't say hi repeatedly.
10702343	10704444	If she walks away, don't follow her.
10704464	10705404	Because that's stalking.
10707981	10708401	DarkSakura?
10709201	10716644	Well... If she just doesn't say anything to you, but doesn't move, maybe she didn't hear you.
10717484	10718005	That could be.
10718285	10719645	Or she's pointedly ignoring you.
10719765	10720445	Or she's deaf.
10720625	10721006	Or dead.
10721606	10723186	Or dead.
10723246	10727568	A DDR tournament is not a good place to talk to women because it's so fucking loud there.
10727788	10729369	Wait until they go outside.
10730049	10733130	Casually stand there and go, Oh, hi, I saw you inside.
10733430	10734070	Whip it out!
10736914	10737474	Go planet!
10737554	10738255	Illusion says...
10766513	10766953	What the hell?
10768655	10773059	Read any good books lately that aren't of the homoerotic variety, a.k.a.
10773159	10773880	Anne Rice novels?
10774741	10775461	Actually, it's funny.
10775641	10780866	My bathroom reading right now is an Anne Rice novel.
10780946	10782968	I'm reading the sequel to Blackwood Farm.
10791692	10794975	But it's all from Lestat's point of view, which I think he's absolutely hilarious.
10795635	10802861	If you want to know why people are busting up laughing, it's because somebody in chat said, DER attorneys are not a good place to talk to girls because they are probably underage.
10804142	10807184	Anybody else reading any books they want to share?
10807504	10809005	I'm reading a book on how to start your own business.
10809966	10811627	Will Wheaton, just a geek.
10811727	10814710	He's an awesome author and he's even funnier live.
10814870	10815310	That's hot.
10816384	10826008	Dark Knight says, about Mario DDR, if they had no choice but to put a Max 300 style song in it using a Nintendo game song, what would it be?
10826028	10827109	The Legend of Zelda!
10827169	10827229	Duh!
10827249	10827369	Duh!
10847199	10856567	If real radio makes Captain Jack cry, do pay-based podcasts make Politary make another bad song?
10859289	10860690	Pay-based podcasts?
10860810	10861931	That makes me sick.
10862551	10867295	If a tree falls in the middle of the forest and nobody's around, nobody's still listening to internet radio.
10874266	10876068	I remember that in Family Guy.
10876148	10879752	He's like, yeah, Phil fell down last week and he hasn't stopped talking about it.
10881734	10883696	Mikulatov has a question for Loki.
10884116	10888921	Loki, why did you not include Strangers with Candy, the movie, as one of the must-see movies of the year?
10890475	10917295	because I had to pick one and you know Sin City was over Strangers with Candy I still want to see Constantine over Sin City I will make Strangers with Candy my must-see movie of the year there you have it I still want to see Constantine Legend of Zaku says out of all the acts from last Tuesday's and Wednesday's American Idol which do you think was the worst act and why?
10917796	10919237	did anybody actually watch it?
10920352	10921672	Who in here doesn't watch TV?
10922533	10923873	My hand is raised.
10924473	10925513	I watched it.
10926054	10927594	I was here watching it, remember?
10928714	10930235	I think the last chick was cool.
10930815	10932175	Because she was insane.
10933535	10935596	I would say the guy that was related to Toni Braxton.
10936156	10936696	Supposedly.
10940457	10942558	Who was the worst singer on American Idol Tuesday or Wednesday?
10943178	10947659	Oh, it was the crazy girl who had multiple personalities and she had different voices talking to her.
10947699	10948379	That was hilarious.
10949847	10953408	SSJ100 Matt says, Why do only gay guys and not hot girls get turned on by guys playing DDR?
10976943	10977963	Here's my answer to that.
10978023	10983665	This is Murphy's Law in action, because I, being a gay man, I only attract women playing DDR.
10984605	10986386	So that's just the way life works, buddy.
10986926	10987266	Sorry.
10987926	10990327	Your non-preferred gender is the one that'll start hitting on you.
10990387	10991567	It's just, life's funny.
10993247	10995848	Oh, it says, Shark's Girl says on the contrary.
10995868	10997088	Well, if you're a girl, it's different.
10997709	11002490	Yeah, if you're a girl and you're playing any video game and you're any good at it, yeah, you get some attention most of the time.
11002970	11006091	Oh my God, when I worked for Cyber Station...
11007714	11011935	Walking around with the Pac-Man shirt, playing Tekken 3 back in the day.
11012395	11014655	You've got boobs and you're good at games!
11014976	11015956	Marry me now!
11015976	11017736	Yeah, and I just kicked your ass.
11018276	11026498	When I worked at the shark store, wearing a hockey jersey, spouting facts and knowing more than the guys around, um, oh dear god, it was crazy.
11027358	11032899	What would get to people is when I would accurately predict the next character to come out, because I would follow the Japanese machines.
11033879	11036260	And actually, they did three characters out of order.
11037205	11043590	I was playing Star Wars once and I had 10 year old boys that looked like they were about ready to propose marriage to me because I was so good at it.
11044391	11048334	I would put the cursor where characters were before they were there because I had memorized all the patterns.
11049214	11051436	Boys don't like it when girls are smarter than they are.
11051536	11053157	I try to pretend like I'm stupid.
11059640	11063262	I think it's a line that you hit depending on what type of group.
11065624	11070567	You get the worship in some groups and then you get the other way around in other groups.
11070587	11071948	It was really bad in Alabama.
11072788	11079032	I was just glad that my boyfriend at the time was as big of a nerd as I was and liked to drink just as much as I did.
11083752	11094438	Alright, we gotta wrap it up, so one more question, and then we're gonna put the nail in the coffin on Ask Orange Lounge, and I apologize to those of you that were cutting off, we just did the questions in the order we received them, so you were towards the end, sorry guys.
11094999	11104144	DDR Angel wants to know, if Myst is like 20 years old and still very popular, what do you think DDR or Bramante in general will be at its 20 year old birthday?
11105265	11105665	20 years old.
11106696	11116845	I think it'll be the thing that's going to be on VH1's I Love the Zeros and Hal Sparks is sitting there going, those crazy kids were playing that game with the flashing seizure lights.
11116985	11119788	And somewhere someone's still going to be raping the bar.
11121770	11122150	Word.
11122470	11122771	Word.
11123760	11126601	Alright, I think that definitely sums it up.
11127201	11127801	DarkSakura?
11127821	11131282	I just had this vision of this person 20 years from now.
11132222	11137503	Waiting until everybody's gone, the lights are out, reaching into their closet and pulling out one of those bars.
11138223	11145285	This is Orange Lounge Radio Live, this is episode 1048, and you're... And I need a job!
11146865	11147225	Alright.
11147625	11148986	Well, our contract just ended for G5.
11151661	11154032	And you know, we've decided that we're going to go off on our own.
11154173	11154936	We're going to expand.
11155976	11161437	And, you know, we just got done buying out 50 companies, and this one we're all uber successful and elitist.
11161477	11163818	We have people to pretend to be us.
11164498	11172660	And in the latest ratings book, we just got the latest ratings book, and look, Orange Lounge Radio has beaten G4 Television in the ratings book.
11173180	11178402	And, oh, it looks like the two guys tickling each other channel on Live 365 also beat G4.
11182443	11184063	In fact, it looks like
11184699	11191020	G4 came in next to last place and in last place the microphone up a donkey's butt station.
11191040	11194221	Hey, I like that station.
11195101	11198582	Don't be dissing the microphone up ass ass station.
11200542	11200882	Alright.
11201602	11203403	We gotta go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
11203423	11204823	Sorry to those questions we didn't get to.
11205163	11210624	Explicit, your final thought.
11213625	11214525	Mel B, your final thought.
11215208	11216729	Oh man, it's good to be back up in here.
11216749	11218610	I'm so boring, I don't have one.
11218650	11219970	How much money would it take?
11219990	11222852	I kid you not, I have seen pictures of a baby soup.
11240129	11247175	Go to superzooi.com, that's S-U-P-E-R-Z-O-O-I dot com.
11247455	11253800	In the left-hand column, there will be a picture thing, and click on the one that says Baby Soup, and it actually shows it.
11255181	11257382	My final thought is, why is he a co-host?
11258824	11259124	Why?
11259684	11260265	Why, why, why?
11260385	11260645	Jamie?
11260925	11264088	My final thought was because he sat on the floor long enough to yearn to spot...

11347206	11354249	In sleep he sang to me, in dreams he came, that voice which calls to me and speaks my name.
11393663	11420734	My power over you grows stronger yet And though you turn from me to glance behind The phantom of the authorized

11618160	11621462	You know, I totally forgot to get into the DDR Freak Idol thing.
11621883	11625025	You know they're doing a DDR Freak Idol competition in random chat right now?
11625265	11627066	Oh, lovely.
11627086	11629248	And I'm going to volunteer us to get involved somehow.
11629308	11630148	I think it might be fun.

11644875	11645295	DarkSakura.com
11669676	11673819	And then when they get the car, they have to answer more questions or else they destroy the car.
11676261	11677241	It was great.
11678102	11680764	Now this question is for your windshield.
11682405	11687328	And the guy got it wrong, so the losing contestants are there with like shit.
11687348	11695073	So the guy had a sledgehammer, smashed it once with a sledgehammer, smashed it again, smashed it a third time with a sledgehammer, went through the windshield.
