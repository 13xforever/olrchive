289608	289948	What?
292169	293790	I have a mouthful of asparagus.
297560	298421	That's not what I heard.
298481	302405	It sounded like she was mumbling local street names and stuff from around here.
302905	309071	Alright, also in that corner, the other co-host, the fabulous, wonderful, tech master, Loki!
311673	314315	Who's waving at you right now because he's not near a microphone.
315517	316277	Not prepared.
316778	317238	No, I'm kidding.
317278	318499	He's doing other stuff.
318539	318860	Alright.
319460	321182	We do have a bunch of special guests, though.
322465	326969	We always love having special guests in studio, especially some old favorites which we have here tonight.
327409	330071	Yes, I think some of you guys are now designated old favorites.
331272	332673	Including... Old, maybe.
335515	339959	Including everybody's favorite psycho forum goddess.
341020	341460	Head bitch.

344142	344823	Uh, hi.
345823	346884	Yo, what up?
347485	347945	How you doing?
347965	348906	That mic's a little quiet.
349726	350507	I was noticing that.
350607	351928	You gotta... from the gut.
352825	355928	You don't want me to go first.
355968	357790	I'm just blasting everybody out now.
357870	359891	You gotta yell like you're yelling at newbies.
361693	363094	If only you knew.
364956	370060	Alright, also joining us tonight, say hello to Islander.
370341	370881	Hello everyone.
371221	371862	How you doing?
372342	373423	Good and loud tonight.
373503	373964	Absolutely.
374344	375125	I learned my lesson.
375822	376703	We have a new microphone.
376723	381186	We finally, after about four weeks, replaced that microphone that was cutting out for our guests.
381727	382667	But it's a little quiet.
384348	386550	So, because we had to play some mic roulette, actually.
387051	388071	So, yeah.
388372	391814	Anyway, also say hello to joining us on this show.
392875	394816	It hasn't been here in several years.
395857	396718	Yeah, it's been a while.
396998	399020	He grew since the last time I saw him.
401001	402502	Say hello to Jazz.
402862	403563	Hello, everybody.
404178	407281	I know him better as Kamikaze, though, from the Final Fantasy universe.
407561	408341	Yay.
409382	409803	All right.
410463	411904	Say hello to another old favorite.
412265	415607	And she's such an old favorite that she's getting moldy.
416408	417909	Say hello to DDR Angel.
419050	419490	Hello.
420011	420531	I'm late.
421052	421192	Ah!
422093	427737	Now, they would have never known that because you were here right before your cue, but you just had to go and spill all the beans, so now they know you're tired.
427777	428898	Our webcam wasn't even on.
429178	429819	They couldn't see.
430800	431120	All right.
432185	436066	Anyway, can I just start off by saying, I love our chat room.
437446	440847	I love our chat room, www.orangelonsradio.com, click on chat.
441287	448329	I love this, MPQ in chat says, Every time I hear the opening, I think my mom will think I'm looking at porn or something.
448349	450529	Because, you know, we have that sexy voice in there.
450889	452410	You're listening to Orange Lens, right?
453310	457331	And then somebody else replies here, Shade23 says, Well, why aren't you?
462295	464897	Masterbating to Pornography
490345	492266	Big 2DX game released last year.
492406	494248	Now I can say last year, because we're in 2005.
494988	496569	So big 2DX game released last year.
496589	498030	We're going to hear some music from 2DX Red.
498050	504594	And when we come back, all that randomness and chatter you've come to expect from your buddies here at Orange Lounge Radio.
504614	505155	We'll be back.
509037	510058	We'll be back.
563538	564490	Thank you for watching!
595080	596447	Thank you for watching!
631960	632906	Thanks for watching!

833530	834451	Thanks for watching!
863974	873337	And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.
874080	878162	Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.
878183	879143	Can we talk about that?
879423	881785	No subject will ever be taboo.
882065	885687	Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.
886207	888769	Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.
889269	894612	Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?
895172	896453	I collect your fucking head.
898402	899923	Just like this fucker here.
900203	904687	Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?
904967	908329	The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!
909290	915734	Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!
916955	920738	Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.
920758	923380	Orange Lounge Radio
924813	929958	Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 125.
930979	933701	That's some kind of landmark number, isn't it?
933721	933701	125?
933781	934102	I don't know.
935343	935723	Maybe not.
936043	936784	A dollar and a quarter?
936824	937165	I don't know.
937785	938526	Anyway, we're here.
940202	943104	for your listening pleasure or displeasure, as the case may be.
943925	947407	www.orangeonstrater.com for all the interaction stuff with the show.
947467	952951	We know you guys love to interact with the show, whether it be via the chat room or via the Skype line, which I should sign into at some point.
953372	957875	But we will have Orange Ons Radio on the Skype line so you can call in later in the show if you want and all that good stuff.
958736	960477	Just sitting here, sitting back, talking about...
961232	964254	Music-based video games and, you know, Bomani-type games.
964494	967715	And just, you know, really anything that doesn't suck is fair game here.
968216	969696	And even some stuff that does suck.
969756	971157	We have a whole segment dedicated to that.
971597	972898	So we'll get into that a little later.
973678	978120	But first we have to start off tonight's show as we start off every week's show.
978140	979441	125 episodes and nothing's changed.
980061	980762	How was your week?
980822	981522	How was your day?
981542	985464	And we're going to start it off with the lovely DarkSakura, who actually wasn't here last week.
985484	986605	Because you were sick last week, right?
987325	987705	I was.
988265	989026	I was actually...
989895	991716	Pretty damn tired last week.
991876	992637	That's too bad to hear.
993057	993557	Everything okay?
993577	995038	But you seem good now.
995078	996258	But I have sexy jeans.
996979	999100	You do have sexy... I haven't taken a look at your sexy jeans here.
999120	999660	I'm not wearing them.
999840	999960	Oh.
1000101	1001441	They're in the washer.
1001962	1002382	Oh, okay.
1002422	1003943	Well, we want to see your sexy jeans.
1004283	1005564	This is why we have a webcam.
1005844	1007244	There's never anything interesting on a webcam.
1007264	1008925	Half of them are recessive.
1008985	1010366	Actually, a quarter of them are recessive.
1010546	1011086	How's that work?
1011407	1012747	My jeans are a quarter recessive.
1012807	1013468	Everybody's are.
1018450	1018831	How was your week?
1018851	1019271	How was your day?
1019291	1019371	Good.
1020271	1021613	Hey, DarkSakura!
1033780	1043725	So, I'm going to be changing from the exciting world of student loans going into the exciting world, again, of home mortgages.
1043925	1045346	I'm going to be working in the escrow department.
1045366	1050289	Which is something probably I would estimate that 98% of our listeners know nothing about.
1051149	1054991	I would have to say that 98% of homeowners know nothing about.
1056872	1060154	Considering our average age of the listener would be about, what, 12?
1060714	1061374	I don't know.
1061394	1061915	No, I'm kidding.
1062375	1062755	I don't know.
1063171	1063911	www.DarkSakura.com
1086960	1116353	your mortgage company has the option of paying your taxes and insurance with your house payment so they will actually set it up to where you have the money in a separate holding account which is an escrow account to pay your taxes and insurance and that's what I'm going to be doing is making sure that they're managed properly because if they're not it gives people lots of trouble with the government makes people really poor because trust me when you go to buy a house don't be a retard about it come talk to me anyway
1118236	1123280	So, also making some changes, other changes.
1124060	1130044	And as of tomorrow, I am back on the straight and narrow for my big resolution.
1131085	1133287	I'm going to say this on the air tonight.
1133627	1133987	Uh-oh.
1134488	1136109	See, last year I lost 50 pounds.
1136349	1137410	This year I'm going to lose another 50.
1140591	1144173	You're going to be a toothpick before long if you keep losing all this weight.
1144213	1144954	I don't think so.
1145234	1146214	Not the way I'm doing it.
1147135	1149397	I want the Linda Hamilton Terminator 2 look.
1149457	1150938	I want it to be tough.
1151238	1152439	I want to kick people's ass.
1152919	1155121	And then take out a submachine gun and go blow away.
1155261	1155821	Oh, sorry.
1157502	1161545	I'm also going to take gun safety classes this year.
1162566	1162946	Oh no.
1164423	1169166	I remember this was the discussion last January, is that Jamie was going to get a gun.
1169687	1171348	I couldn't afford a gun last year.
1171368	1174850	Thankfully the discussion went away for a while, and now, great, it's back.
1175931	1177352	Jamie got a gun.
1177372	1179634	Okay, you know what?
1181495	1183877	When I go postal, the first place I'm coming is here.
1186619	1187339	Seriously, though.
1189321	1190802	Come on, you couldn't resist that one.
1191753	1197056	Um, I'm gonna, you know, we're talking about getting like, you know, a little crappy .22 rifle, but I'm gonna work up.
1197856	1198737	Remind me again.
1199957	1200918	What do you need a gun for?
1200938	1202979	To shoot stuff, duh!
1204179	1205120	Stress relief!
1206340	1207361	Stress relief, she says.
1208221	1209362	What are you gonna be shooting?
1209402	1210482	You're not gonna be going to golf?
1210502	1211443	An animal object.
1211463	1212804	You're not gonna be going to golf land, are you?
1212824	1213344	Stray dogs.
1215139	1223963	You have to remember that Roseville Golf Land, for those who have never been there, one of our local arcades we play at, it's two stories, and not a lot goes on on the second story.
1224043	1225224	Except me with a sniper rifle.
1225644	1226324	Exactly.
1226604	1227384	That's my fear.
1227624	1230005	Defile my machine, I dare you.
1231006	1235528	Don't you think it would be quite humorous, though, if they put like a silent scope machine up there?
1236008	1236928	Dude, that'd be rad.
1241470	1241750	Anyway.
1242611	1243711	I was sick on Christmas Day.
1244773	1245213	I'm sorry.
1246034	1250236	I was sick with like this nasty fatigue, which actually lasted into Sunday.
1251416	1259060	But I was, I got up, I went to breakfast, went to bed.
1260461	1263262	Got up, went to dinner over at Dan's aunt's house.
1264283	1266664	And then when he was, I said, just take me home.
1266844	1268985	I'm not going to be able to hang out with your cousins and play video games.
1269683	1271864	Let's go play DDR at your cousin's house.
1271964	1272384	No.
1273625	1274745	No, Jamie, go bed.
1276086	1276586	I went home.
1276626	1280127	I sat up for about an hour just, you know, checking my email, settling stuff.
1280408	1281148	My ass was in bed.
1281328	1282408	I was like, no, I can't deal with it.
1282869	1285870	So, I was asleep for most of Christmas.
1287851	1292092	Well, you know, in some ways, sometimes it's better that way to be asleep for Christmas.
1292172	1293453	But I did get nifty presents.
1293513	1294293	I got gift cards.
1295454	1298495	Which means that the day after, I was
1299147	1301229	Basically wearing myself out shopping, but it was fun.
1301329	1301989	It was very fun.
1302710	1305612	I went shopping with Tia and Jessica, and we had a fun time.
1307574	1320144	The day after Christmas is kind of a nightmare shopping day, though, because I remember that I was at Best Buy, I think, that day, and I just... Oh my gosh, it was crazy.
1320564	1322506	The line was going around the block.
1323247	1324508	It was pretty crazy.
1324528	1326049	Just the thing is that I didn't have...
1327259	1344252	I mean, basically, I was really, really, I shouldn't by all rights have been out, but it's the day after freaking Christmas, sales, you know, womanly instinct is stronger than fatigue sometimes, and then I had an eggnog frappuccino.
1346095	1351376	I wish Starbucks would never get rid of those because they're so good and I know they're going to be gone Monday probably.
1351776	1358538	I'm actually glad they're gone because they proved to be too much temptation especially with the Starbucks.
1358638	1365279	The one thing that keeps me away from the Starbucks by my present location of work is the fact that it's right by a freaking Target.
1366099	1368180	So traffic is enough to keep me away.
1369840	1369960	I'm
1370703	1374365	I know a lot of people out there are very, very anti-Starbucks.
1374626	1378168	And for those of you guys that don't have a Starbucks in your neighborhood, just wait.
1378248	1379108	You'll have one soon.
1379709	1381070	It's a coffee shop for those that didn't know.
1381110	1381430	It's huge.
1381470	1383091	We have a Mississippi orgy going on.
1385225	1386606	I'm talking Starbucks.
1386646	1386966	Hold on.
1387486	1388467	Mississippi orgy can wait.
1388487	1389667	It's not week and day.
1390308	1390668	Two.
1391228	1392469	But I just wanted to say Starbucks.
1392589	1394170	It's not as bad as you people make it out to be.
1394330	1396651	They have great, some of their coffee is so good.
1397071	1398132	Even if it is a month old.
1398732	1398912	Yeah.
1399072	1400032	Anyway, I'm sorry to interrupt.
1400193	1401373	Their coffee beans are a month old.
1402894	1403214	At least.
1404275	1414820	But no, in Mississippi it's law that if you have more than three people in the same room, at least of course one has to be of a different gender, and they're not wearing shoes, it's an orgy.
1416073	1416994	and the state of Mississippi.
1417354	1418395	You have got to be kidding.
1418675	1419855	I'm not kidding you at all.
1420676	1421416	So let's see.
1421516	1422917	Jamie doesn't have shoes on.
1423618	1424999	The Guana Girl doesn't have shoes on.
1425279	1426399	I don't have shoes on.
1427500	1428561	Good thing we're not in Mississippi.
1429581	1431202	Thank God we're not in Mississippi.
1431603	1432663	Sorry people in Mississippi.
1433364	1434104	But thank God.
1435665	1439528	With all due respect to our friends in Mississippi, thank God we're not you.
1443822	1448085	And, you know, I actually have room to say this because I've been in Mississippi.
1448906	1449826	I'm from Alabama.
1450567	1452328	I have been in Mississippi quite a bit.
1453088	1454409	My mom works in Biloxi.
1458372	1459132	I like California.
1460954	1471521	And also, as far as the rest of my weekend day has been, it's just been, today has been kind of, yesterday was really just weird for me.
1472711	1473872	I'd have to say it ended well.
1473912	1474753	It ended very well.
1474993	1475354	That's good.
1475574	1477856	But today has just been like, ugh, rain.
1478977	1480498	I noticed you were a little drained yesterday.
1480538	1486624	We were doing the Top 10, 14 show, whatever, 10 or 14, whatever it was, over on DDR Freak Radio.
1487265	1490688	And I think we were all feeling a little drained after that.
1490708	1493971	I think we're just so used to doing these things on Sunday nights.
1495152	1495773	Well, I had...
1496286	1498968	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1522213	1527016	And they had KR3, and so I knew the only way that I'd get to hear Waiting For You was if I was the one to sing it.
1527076	1528337	So I was like, okay, well, I'll do that.
1529297	1530818	And everyone was like, oh, that song's cool.
1530938	1531519	Who did that?
1531939	1534461	And so I got to be all nerdy and say, hey, that's from Silent Hill 4.
1534581	1535261	You should play that.
1538143	1548369	But today's just been, you know... Yesterday, though, see, I was headachy and sick all New Year's night, New Year's Eve.
1548970	1551211	And then yesterday morning, I was just feeling really...
1553228	1560734	Just out of it because I did something really stupid the night before after consuming two bottles of Guinness in ten minutes.
1562295	1567379	And for those of you that were listening about six months ago when we had our last drunk show, was it that long?
1567399	1567839	I think it was.
1568760	1569180	Oh, yeah.
1569861	1573183	When I passed out in your bed and then proceeded to eat four waffles.
1574024	1578547	I think that was the same show where I was kicking at the wall going, I'm in the Matrix, I'm in the Matrix.
1579648	1581770	I will buy you some damn waffles, okay?
1581790	1581870	Sure.
1584863	1589906	Next Saturday, I will take you for waffles.
1591207	1593388	Okay, free food, yeah.
1593468	1596190	Okay, I say this on the air.
1596830	1599231	Next Saturday, or at least a Saturday in the future.
1601693	1602673	Wait a minute, wait a minute.
1603254	1604114	Okay, next Saturday.
1604214	1605455	Next Saturday, we will go get waffles.
1605915	1606796	We're backpedaling.
1607376	1609377	No, next Saturday, we will get waffles.
1609397	1610178	Keep your schedule free.
1610678	1610978	All right.
1611843	1612583	I want to tag along.
1612603	1613524	You don't have to buy me waffles.
1613544	1615224	I'll buy my own waffle.
1615444	1616445	Orange Challenge Breakfast.
1616465	1617565	Are we going to go to Country Waffles?
1618126	1618306	Sure.
1618486	1621107	Because they got peanut butter banana waffles there.
1624688	1626169	Waffles blessed by Jesus.
1626549	1629750	Loki says that for a reason.
1629770	1631111	Because the Country Waffles place...
1632089	1634511	is decorated in Jesus, basically.
1634651	1635471	Are you serious?
1635511	1637012	Yeah, it has a Jesus theme to it.
1637232	1638813	You know, you've been to places like this before.
1638993	1639133	No.
1640254	1647439	Well, some places have, like, you know, the jungle theme, and some places have the, you know, the element theme and the cave theme.
1647719	1649300	This place has a Jesus theme.
1650240	1652442	I was going to take you there, and then they changed management.
1655043	1655284	Anyway.
1655644	1655984	But, um...
1658552	1659853	Do they have whole grain waffles?
1660274	1664116	I don't know, but I'm just waiting for the Virgin Mary to show up in my waffle so I can sell it on eBay.
1665057	1668779	Because, damn, you can make a killing on eBay.
1668799	1672662	So you remember that guy that sold the French toast that had the Virgin Mary's likeness in it?
1672902	1673983	Wasn't it like 10 years old or something?
1674003	1678125	Yeah, he had saved it for 10 years and finally was like, time to move on.
1678146	1682689	Anyway, sorry to keep interrupting.
1682849	1686231	That reminds me of, you remember the old Bloom County comics?
1686251	1686531	Yeah.
1687051	1687712	The first opus.
1688886	1693408	They had the one about the woman who had the image of Elvis in mold on her refrigerator.
1694308	1697269	And then later on the crowds dispersed because it turned into Mr. Ed.
1698689	1699470	The mold crew.
1701390	1704731	But anyway, I'm in a much better mood now than I was.
1705191	1707892	I was in a crap mood all day.
1708753	1709353	So I'm happy now.
1710853	1712014	Look at me grin.
1712294	1716395	And of course the people listening will never ever see this because I fear...
1717185	1717585	Webcams.
1717625	1718105	The webcam.
1718285	1719125	Alright, well, fair enough.
1720306	1721466	Alright.
1721506	1721906	Done.
1722166	1722786	Let's move on.
1722946	1723426	Loki!
1723806	1725126	We haven't heard a lot from you yet tonight.
1725166	1725547	How was your week?
1725567	1726027	How was your day?
1726767	1733308	But little does she realize, we've hidden a hidden camera up above Rob to capture her without her knowing... Oh, just a second.
1733668	1734548	You can bite me.
1736449	1741790	HotOrangeLoungeUpskirtCam.com I'm wearing jeans.
1741870	1742290	Doesn't work.
1742330	1743690	This is why nobody visits that site.
1749209	1749709	New Year's Eve?
1749769	1759572	We played Trivial Pursuit 90s Edition and watched South Park.
1775967	1776567	Which is nothing.
1776707	1777748	Oh, and Torture the Cat.
1778468	1782569	And, um... But not with a gun, right?
1783270	1783790	No, with a whip.
1784950	1785170	Okay.
1786491	1788832	And, um... Yeah.
1789432	1792613	That's about all I did, I think.
1792653	1793594	This week kind of sucked.
1794254	1795774	At least I didn't have to do any more potlucks.
1796435	1797035	Stupid company.
1799756	1800256	Yeah, that's about it.
1802133	1804957	Alright, I'll go later, so let's hear from some guests.
1805417	1806679	Where's the mic getting handed over there?
1806739	1809302	Alright, Jazz, who, by the way...
1810046	1811906	won one of our Kiryamoka CDs.
1812086	1812567	Yay.
1813147	1820428	And if I remember right, one of the rules for the contest was that being here so many times rendered you ineligible, but you were like just under that?
1820608	1821308	Yeah.
1821368	1822369	I've been here once before.
1822449	1823549	Okay, so now this is your second.
1823569	1824529	What was it, like three times?
1824689	1830130	Because I was going to say, that's kind of funny if this would push you over that limit after you already won the contest, but... He, he, he.
1830570	1831470	Technicalities rule.
1831750	1832051	All right.
1832691	1834771	Didn't you end up giving away that CD to one of your friends?
1834851	1836551	Yes, for Christmas I gave it to my best friend.
1836631	1837312	And what did she say?
1837592	1839232	She said, oh my God, a bunch of times.
1840197	1841459	Thank you for watching!
1859717	1861939	and every time we got teamed together we would kick ass.
1862199	1862999	You don't understand.
1863019	1864080	You don't understand.
1864120	1866322	There's a rule about when Rob plays Mario Party.
1866802	1870705	I have to be Princess Peach or I throw a fit like a little baby, okay?
1871625	1874407	So I took Daisy because Rob already took Peach and I got mad.
1876128	1880211	Anyway, so after New Year's I slept for a little bit.
1880992	1886856	Then I woke up and then I came here for the Top 14 show and that was fun.
1887569	1891732	and then we went back to Jessica's place and we all slept.
1892813	1893253	Together?
1893713	1893974	No.
1894194	1894294	Oh.
1898417	1901559	Actually, we played Rumble Roses a lot and that was fun.
1901619	1901999	I'm sorry.
1902720	1903761	No, don't be sorry.
1903801	1904681	That's a great game.
1904721	1905842	It's hilarious.
1905922	1907023	Rumble Roses is pretty funny.
1907363	1909445	The story mode is just hilarious for that game.
1911426	1916269	And so today I went to RVGL for the first time in like ever.
1916289	1916710	I'm sorry.
1917679	1918359	I'm so sorry.
1918499	1919219	It wasn't too bad.
1919440	1921600	It's not as bad as it was about a year ago.
1921620	1924261	If he'd gone about a year ago, it would have been like, oh boy.
1924501	1927482	But now, it's improving.
1928062	1930583	Did you say hello to the new 2DX machine that has no monitor?
1930983	1931183	Yes.
1931363	1931643	Oh, okay.
1931803	1932323	I was curious.
1933944	1934244	Let's see.
1935825	1937845	Basically, I just played Taiken 5 all day.
1938145	1938845	And that was fun.
1939266	1940486	Because I finally have a card.
1940726	1941326	Even though it costs $5.
1941846	1942467	But I don't care.
1942807	1943807	Because it's a good game.
1944047	1944767	It's good, damn it.
1945067	1944767	$5?
1945187	1945748	It's $5 for a card.
1947366	1948207	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1968403	1971147	Um, the chick related to, uh, Jun.
1971627	1971988	Asuka?
1972228	1972749	Asuka, yeah.
1972769	1974811	Same person as you?
1974831	1977855	Just because Jin's moves are not fun anymore.
1977975	1981679	Okay, I'm kind of a Tekken retard, so explain something to me.
1982260	1986104	What exactly is the difference between Tekken 4 and Tekken 5, besides the card thing?
1986385	1988327	Tekken 4 was dumb and Tekken 5 isn't.
1989116	1990497	I like Tekken 4.
1990717	1992618	I like Tekken 4 a whole bunch.
1992718	1999362	Tekken 4 was basically, to me, it seemed like Tekken was trying to be like DOA and it did not work at all for me.
2000063	2004165	And Tekken 5 is a lot more like Tag, which I loved, so it worked a lot for better.
2004565	2008748	I didn't care for Tag, but I do like Tekken 5 just because I was a Jin player in Tekken 2.
2009008	2012350	And that's why I played Jin, because I was also a Kazuya player.
2013070	2015832	Who's the guy without the shirt that all the girls swoon over?
2016206	2016686	Jin?
2016866	2018027	Then again, there's also Hwarang.
2018167	2019748	But he was the Korean guy with the red hair.
2019788	2020889	Okay, no, I'm not talking about Hwarang.
2020909	2021750	I'm talking about Jin.
2022170	2022450	Okay.
2023010	2023851	Is Jin in Tekken 5?
2024531	2024871	Yes.
2025112	2025352	Okay.
2025872	2026472	And he's still hot.
2026773	2027493	Okay.
2027533	2028394	That was my next question.
2028434	2028774	Thank you.
2030795	2031576	And that was about it.
2033077	2033377	Alrighty.
2033977	2035458	Let's move on to Islander.
2035598	2036159	How was your week?
2036199	2037820	How was your day?
2037860	2038860	Week was actually pretty good.
2038940	2039361	Pretty good.
2040001	2042843	Just spent all... Work was so damn slow.
2043585	2047007	I just spent my entire day trying to find stuff to do.
2047547	2050989	It was to the point where we were cutting papers just for scratch paper.
2051609	2053070	I spent about a day doing that.
2053770	2054690	Just out of sheer boredom.
2054971	2055671	It was horrible.
2056598	2058538	Were you making little crafts out of them, too?
2058558	2059639	You know, it's really funny.
2062639	2070501	One of our roommates downloaded... He actually printed up some papers on how to make origami rhinos and left them at work.
2071001	2073882	And I was half-concerning actually making some, but didn't get around to doing it.
2075662	2076402	But, anyways.
2077743	2083884	Other than that, you know, spent New Year's... You know, I didn't have as many jello shots as I should have.
2084636	2085156	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
2109688	2111030	Oh, absolutely, good stuff.
2112753	2117200	But yeah, like, you know, Jazz and I played a lot of Rumble Roses.
2119343	2121507	He played Tekken 5, I played DLC, like I always do.
2122230	2123530	because DLC is my crack.
2124711	2130232	Is it just me, or is there now starting to become like a little Roseville Golf Land following for Derby Owners Club?
2130252	2131072	No, there is, there is.
2131452	2133293	I was actually playing, and there was this one guy.
2133473	2134593	And there are people I've never seen before.
2135333	2137534	There was one guy who was playing, and he had some pretty good horses.
2138314	2142315	And whenever he saw mine pop up, he was, I could always hear a sigh from the back.
2142335	2143875	It's like, ah, damn, I'm going to be in for it.
2144695	2145896	And I could not beat this fucker.
2147176	2147736	I could not beat him.
2148556	2151257	When we finally left, he actually turned around and said, hey, man, you're pretty good, and
2151772	2154073	I was like, wow, okay, interesting.
2154213	2157575	But yeah, there is a little following there, and I hope it really takes off.
2157855	2163098	In the beginning, though, if I remember right, half the following was just Milpitas people driving up to see their machine.
2165339	2168461	You know, and the people calling in saying, hey, we want our machine back.
2169784	2171844	Oh, whatever happened with that?
2172005	2172485	You know what, though?
2172665	2173525	That does kind of suck.
2173745	2177646	If you're in that area, in Milpitas area, and to have a machine like that.
2177866	2178806	Oh, that's true, that's true.
2178826	2179426	Poop, poop, poop.
2179906	2180726	True, true, true.
2182147	2183127	They can pay twice as much money.
2184807	2185668	I did that for a long time.
2185968	2186248	Blah.
2188028	2188808	Well, okay, then.
2191069	2191529	Alright, yes?
2192469	2196390	About RVGL, though, there was one very odd thing that I saw.
2197290	2203053	I was playing Drum Mania, sucking like usual because I don't play Drum Mania, and there's this guy next to me.
2203694	2207996	It was obvious to me that he's kind of mentally handicapped in some way.
2208277	2208637	Okay.
2209417	2214580	But then he went up to the Guitar Freak's screen and either licked it or sniffed it.
2215801	2218823	And I was just mortified beyond all belief.
2219343	2221204	Maybe he didn't understand how to play the game.
2221865	2224206	He was like sniffing Tran or something.
2224246	2225867	I was like, what the hell is going on?
2226647	2229009	And yeah, that was a little scary, so I ran away.
2229910	2231711	I can smell your cunt from here.
2231731	2235033	Oh no, you didn't.
2235053	2241518	That's a film reference.
2241538	2242439	Rob is red.
2242519	2243179	This is funny.
2244921	2248203	I think what made that so funny is because that was really out of nowhere.
2248623	2253287	I mean, just... Not only was it out of nowhere, but it was so obscure...
2254488	2256189	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2286118	2290899	Hey, that's what we're here to do, to fulfill your naughty words quotient of the week.
2290919	2294161	That's what I get for missing Rocky all this time.
2295161	2296121	I have to get it someplace.
2297902	2301663	Week was relatively calm.
2302824	2308746	Like Jamie was saying, we did the whole big, massive shopping trip on Sunday, which was pretty cool because...
2309924	2313768	I have really, really, really, really, really needed new clothing.
2315509	2324057	I've been shrinking out of everything that I own and it's very difficult to find new clothes that are at a decent price for big people.
2324577	2326519	But best new reason to buy new clothes, though.
2326859	2327780	Exactly, exactly.
2328261	2333205	So I took my $200 and got a bunch of new bras and all that.
2333285	2334186	La, la, la, la, la.
2335888	2337969	Hey, those suckers cost a lot, buddy.
2338769	2341049	I paid $52 for four bras, and that was on sale.
2342490	2343290	See, you know what?
2343910	2346851	Walmart, $5 for a three-pack undies.
2347291	2349691	It's hard to find... Okay, let me put it this way.
2350432	2355393	It's hard to find bras this big for cheap prices.
2355693	2356313	Alright, alright.
2357153	2359674	It's like, you know, it truly is an over-the-shoulder bra-ble-harter.
2359714	2360474	Did you hear that, boys?
2360814	2361454	Big bras.
2361854	2362654	You know what that means?
2362674	2363255	I need this reference!
2365970	2371852	But we ended up going over to Old Navy and found my jackpot.
2371912	2382137	I managed to get four shirts and two pairs of pants for $100, and I was all super happy because I told myself I wouldn't get anything over a certain size, and I didn't, so yay!
2383937	2385358	But that's about it.
2386498	2387399	My week was pretty boring.
2389320	2390240	I fell asleep a lot.
2391280	2392441	That's what the holidays are for, though.
2392561	2392801	Yeah.
2394249	2395131	I was really tired.
2395472	2396754	And I pulled a butt muscle.
2398719	2400001	Now how did you pull a butt muscle?
2400501	2407205	I was at the gym on Friday doing my FitTrack appointment with Jamie's and my mutual trainer.
2407985	2415689	And I was doing some sort of chest press, and as I stood up to move to another machine, my butt muscle just went, tweak!
2417190	2418811	And suddenly my butt muscle hurt like hell.
2419451	2422653	So my butt muscles hurt ever since, kind of on and off.
2423634	2424294	My butt sores.
2426266	2428027	I think I need one of those little butt pillows.
2429987	2431508	Something you can strap to your bottom.
2432548	2434029	Something like that.
2438610	2441571	Oh my gosh, I'm so glad like half our studio isn't wired up right now.
2441951	2442232	Okay.
2442612	2445153	But that's about it.
2445313	2445993	Alright, alright.
2446273	2447974	I won't torture you with more butt muscle stuff.
2448454	2448914	That's alright.
2449354	2450154	That's what they tune in for.
2450174	2451295	And my socks are in the dryer.
2453655	2455096	Because my feet were wet.
2456017	2460919	This show, honestly, it's about Bomani and it's about Iguana Girls, but that's it.
2461899	2464540	Oh yeah, and I did that show yesterday.
2464700	2465260	Oh yeah, the show.
2465620	2466100	The show was good.
2466580	2467801	We'll talk about the show a little bit.
2468741	2473742	We don't want to recap the whole show because I assume that it's going to be played again later.
2474223	2475883	But we'll talk about the show.
2476643	2478304	I already made my AIDS joke for the week.
2480485	2481485	Angel, how was your week?
2481505	2482005	How was your day?
2483397	2483777	Pretty good.
2483797	2488499	I spent the holidays up in the bay with my folks.
2489559	2497022	And it was pretty good except for the fact that I had internet on Tuesday, the day that I arrived there.
2497222	2501384	By Wednesday, I didn't have internet until Christmas Day.
2502264	2506606	Which didn't really matter anyway because I ended up being sick from...
2507719	2515223	Christmas Day till the Tuesday that I had, or not the Tuesday I had to leave, but, you know, the last day I was supposed to be at my folks.
2515523	2520805	So, that kind of sucked, because I didn't have internet, and then I got sick.
2521106	2532351	And then, yeah, it was basically like a stress panic type deal, because it was like the first time I had been back to my parents' house since I moved out.
2532491	2536313	So, I don't know why it happened, but I guess stress is kind of...
2536980	2541402	You know, known to do that, I guess, and that.
2541582	2546084	But Christmas was good, got some DVDs I wanted, and all that.
2547325	2548445	So I was happy about that.
2550486	2566393	And New Year's was spent just, or New Year's Eve rather, was spent just watching the TV until the fireworks went off, and then the news station was kind of cool because we had, you know, four sets of fireworks going off at the same time, so that was pretty interesting to watch.
2566809	2568530	And then I had a Bloody Mary for the first time.
2569291	2570151	Yay!
2570432	2571813	Angel drank, oh my god!
2573254	2579238	Actually, no, I cheated, because I only had a third of that, and then, like, a third of a glass of champagne, and then I was just like, done.
2579918	2581259	And I still don't like champagne.
2581880	2583041	So, there's that.
2583741	2589485	And then, I've been bad, because I've been on a certain game for the past... Let's see, wait.
2590326	2593008	Probably since... Wednesday...
2593519	2595320	Not as bad as the other two in here.
2605104	2616809	Yeah, I've been playing that just a little too much, but it's okay, because it took me four months to get to that point, so you know what, just yay, alright?
2617369	2617849	That's it.
2620205	2623047	I'd just like to point out for the record that I have not been quite the addict.
2623767	2633232	I did sign on to Final Fantasy XI for a little bit this morning, and I got a message from DDR Angel, and suddenly I noticed that, like, dang, that girl's gained six levels since yesterday.
2633272	2634593	How much has she been playing?
2636394	2638875	Um, lots of PL, that's all I have to say.
2639576	2640096	Alright, anyway.
2641078	2645261	So my week and my day, yeah, okay, a little bit of Final Fantasy XI, but not too bad.
2645742	2647002	I did go out and do some stuff.
2647523	2657030	I went to Iguana Girls New Year's Eve, bashed a little gathering of people there, and I learned how to play Texas Hold'em by watching Celebrity Poker, which I hadn't done before.
2657670	2658951	But I love Kathy Griffin.
2658991	2660212	Oh my God, I love her.
2660352	2663455	And even though she annoys the hell out of most people, I think she's so funny.
2663475	2667177	And she was on the show, and she was the first person booted out that particular episode.
2667197	2667918	Sorry to ruin it for you.
2668291	2673015	She was the first person booted out that particular episode, but it was a good watch, and I learned how to play Texas Hold'em.
2673055	2676178	So, next time you guys have a poker night, it's on.
2676858	2677099	It's on.
2679764	2685248	Let's see, outside of that, New Year's Day, one of my buddies had his birthday.
2685728	2688990	And he lives out in the middle of nowhere, California, basically.
2689010	2690711	He lives about an hour's drive from here.
2690771	2695194	And once you get about an hour out of Sacramento, this is why they call it Cowtown, okay?
2695634	2698536	Unless you're going the hour towards the bay, that's about it.
2699336	2702558	The other hours all around it is nothingness.
2703119	2706241	It looked like the town out of Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, kind of.
2708214	2709154	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2732435	2735998	I'll be able to pass Katas back to back again without having to stop.
2739820	2743063	Which is how it's been lately, so we'll see what happens.
2744043	2745304	Other than that, that's pretty much it.
2745604	2748406	Not a whole lot else for me to report that I can think of off the top of my head.
2748927	2749367	I don't think so.
2749867	2751369	Maybe later, so we go through the rest of the show.
2752429	2755311	In fact, we're going to go to a break here.
2755952	2760115	And when we come back from the break, we're going to talk about...
2762082	2763402	and some New Year's news.
2764103	2769565	And I want to talk about that other new music game that I finally got to take a look at today, even though it's been out for like three months.
2769926	2770846	So we'll talk about that a little bit.
2771346	2774428	And that'll be it when we come back.
2775688	2777870	This break we're going to have some music.
2778230	2780891	Some things that Jamie was saying there kind of inspired me a little bit.
2781211	2784613	So I thought we could do a break of music that makes Jamie angry.
2785193	2786014	That makes me angry?
2786074	2786994	Yes.
2787014	2788175	Was it all solitary?
2788395	2788595	No.
2789415	2790496	No, it's going to be the safari.
2791089	2791670	to start it off.
2791750	2792431	I like the song.
2792491	2794494	As long as you don't play the fast, crappy one.
2794555	2797279	I actually like the song, but it pisses me off to play.
2797379	2797840	Exactly.
2797860	2799703	These are going to be songs that piss Jamie off to play.
2799723	2802167	Although I did manage to stay about a 50% on it.
2802287	2803288	Alright, well, there you go.
2803789	2804370	Alright, here we go.
2804430	2805312	We'll be back after this.
2826597	2827418	Thanks for watching!
2925178	2926160	Thanks for watching!
2966776	2967538	Thanks for watching!
3002575	3003536	Thanks for watching!
3071085	3072029	Thanks for watching!
3127068	3128668	Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.
3129028	3134750	And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.
3134790	3140751	Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.
3141091	3142971	It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.
3143551	3147972	Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.
3148732	3153273	Hello and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, our old buddy Mel there.
3153513	3154614	I don't know when he's coming back to the show.
3154634	3156034	That was one of our very early shows.
3156374	3156614	That...
3157308	3164934	I believe Mel came out for episode 6, which was a long time ago.
3166575	3168076	Back when I was still using the headset.
3168777	3169878	Oh gosh, oh yes.
3170018	3172500	That I acquired from... Memories.
3175622	3178864	We need to have an official nostalgia segment of the show, I think, because it comes up every week.
3178924	3180445	Remember back when Orange Lounge was cool?
3181666	3182727	Hey, we're always cool.
3182747	3184268	I know, I'm just playing around.
3185769	3185870	Um...
3187153	3188493	Let's see, what's going on this week?
3188553	3195996	We had the big show we were doing here yesterday over on that other radio station, DDR Freak Radio.
3198057	3198997	It's fun, it was a good time.
3199057	3204059	It's always fun to partner up with another station, kind of put your resources together to do something fun.
3204719	3209600	It was pretty cool to be a part of the first live show that DDR Freak had really done.
3209620	3211441	Was it the first live show?
3212608	3220912	There was a very, very brief, like, 15-minute thing that I did that was just me being incredibly bored and experimental.
3221132	3221412	Yeah.
3221572	3221892	Okay.
3222172	3228555	And I did, you know, the whole radio DJ bit for a whopping... You're listening to DDR music!
3228615	3229295	It's the top of the hour.
3229875	3230436	Exactly.
3231076	3231356	Okay.
3231396	3231836	Exactly.
3232296	3237719	So I consider yesterday being the first DDR Freak Live special.
3237759	3238179	The first...
3238740	3240221	Horde Show, basically.
3240321	3242943	The one you've got to whore out to the masses to get people to tune in.
3243563	3247245	Because, you know, I've done all of the other crap with the history of DDR.
3248026	3252248	You know, it's cool and all, but I want interaction.
3252268	3255850	I want to be able to get the people involved.
3256050	3258932	Whenever we get the people involved, that's when we get the numbers.
3259172	3260253	Absolutely, absolutely.
3261254	3263995	So that was going on and a very interesting list.
3264035	3265375	It was a top 14.
3265415	3266815	It was originally going to be a top 10.
3267015	3270076	Yeah, because not enough people got their butts out there and voted.
3270096	3277318	To their credit though, it was only a day, but still more people could have done their part.
3277398	3278298	But it's alright, it happens.
3278998	3281119	It's the holidays, I guess.
3282639	3286500	So it ended up, because of all the ties, there was a top 14 list they came up with.
3287836	3288677	We don't want to ruin it.
3288717	3292401	A lot of you guys probably already figured it out for yourselves, maybe, if you know how to do that.
3293302	3295183	Or some of you guys may have tuned in.
3295784	3300228	But there are going to be replays coming up soon, and those will be announced over on DDR Freak Radio.
3300909	3306094	For you dial-up users, because I don't think it's going to show up on DDR Freak low-band, right?
3306535	3307376	No.
3307396	3311119	Low-band is pretty much dying out, and it will probably be disbanded after...
3312225	3312987	DarkSakura.com
3323652	3325033	We can say a pretty good quality.
3325053	3331376	And again, if you guys don't know what MP3 Pro is, and we're not sounding like FM quality to you, then you're missing the MP3 Pro codec.
3331516	3339600	And if you want to just get more information on that, go to www.orangeonsradio.com and click on the FAQ, and that'll give you all the information on the MP3 Pro codec.
3339921	3345323	And if you're listening to us in your iTunes player right now, iTunes does not have MP3 Pro codec.
3345443	3348405	So there's actually a much clearer version of the stream available.
3348785	3349826	All the information is over there.
3349986	3350406	Check it out.
3350799	3351100	DarkSakura.com
3361312	3376655	and I want to say that the DDR Freak Top 10 Countdown we will broadcast for our dial-up users and for those that want to catch it one time and that's Tuesday night as part of Pump Up the Volume.
3377295	3380596	So you have to tune in to Jamie's show because she'll play the Top 10 show as part of her show.
3380756	3381856	And if you don't, I'll kick your butt.
3382056	3383196	Exactly.
3383397	3384137	Same rule as always.
3384177	3385057	Tune in or she'll kick your butt.
3388749	3391871	So, what did you think of the list that ended up, though?
3391911	3393592	Were you kind of surprised with it?
3394413	3397415	It was... I'm not incredibly surprised.
3397675	3402438	I'm surprised at how many songs from how many different mixes got in there.
3403299	3405520	Which, you know, pleasant surprise on that front.
3405640	3408122	But I'm really going to fucking kill Dawn.
3408983	3409783	I'm killing Frequency.
3409823	3411044	That's all there is to it.
3411985	3415107	Dynamite Rave should not have been in that list at all.
3415771	3416712	Thank you very much.
3417993	3421035	And let alone people voting for Dynamite Rave.
3421255	3421756	Good God.
3423417	3426339	That's true, because not only did it have to get nominated, but it had to get voted on.
3426780	3428521	But we're not stupid.
3428561	3433445	We know that folks have their little cliques out there, because, you know, hell, I had my friends voting for Skulk.
3433465	3437268	Yeah, but there were other people voting for Skulk, too.
3437508	3438449	Yeah, I know, I know.
3438489	3439570	That's why it made it in there, but.
3441297	3447601	But, you know, overall, I was pretty pleased to see some of the stuff that ended up on the list.
3447721	3449281	And, you know, I'm glad.
3449762	3452123	I was very happy to see a lot of 2DX representation.
3452143	3453504	A lot of 2DX representation.
3453644	3460067	My biggest surprise was the fact that I think on the whole list there was only two songs that were actually new in 2004.
3460107	3460508	Yeah.
3460768	3461648	I think.
3461788	3462329	Yeah.
3462449	3463269	Off the top of my head.
3463609	3465811	Maybe there's another couple.
3465831	3466991	Not enough love for the U.S.
3467051	3467832	original stuff.
3467892	3469973	No, and that kind of surprised me because I thought...
3470573	3475099	I realize that some people have issues with the US mixes and the way that they've been presented.
3476280	3480425	For example, Extreme, people bitch about the interface, although... They don't bitch about everything.
3480465	3485632	Seriously, they bitch about everything, but the biggest bitch being the interface, although, you know, it's not that bad.
3486767	3489729	But, most people are okay with the songs.
3490309	3493191	You know, I hear a few bitches here and they're like, eh, why is YMCA on there?
3493211	3493872	That song's gay.
3494732	3498455	But, usually, people seem to enjoy the US exclusive songs, especially Max 2.
3498935	3500836	I think nobody can really complain about Max 2.
3500896	3501957	It was great music.
3502017	3504018	Yeah, it was.
3504899	3508501	All of the Max 2 stuff, even some of the Max stuff, it was just great.
3509342	3511784	But, oh well.
3513084	3513905	Yeah, don't go there.
3515946	3516507	DarkBlackForest.com
3544386	3545106	You know what's funny?
3545146	3547547	I think that was a running gag on this show for a while, too.
3547567	3549828	It was, thanks to Darkstown.
3549848	3550548	That was Darkstown.
3550728	3551508	Hold on, hold on.
3551769	3555210	For those who don't know what the Heleguana girl's talking about, here is a little clip, okay?
3555230	3561532	It's a long way to go, honey.
3562632	3562892	I know.
3563993	3564813	But I'm afraid.
3564853	3566153	Where are we going?
3566273	3567974	Into the dark.
3568054	3568594	Big.
3568874	3569414	Black.
3569875	3571335	Far.
3573276	3573976	All right, you need to get...
3576406	3577047	I don't know.
3577687	3578527	Maybe it's just me.
3579567	3580288	I'm afraid.
3580368	3580948	Where are we going?
3581088	3582608	Shut up and take your clothes off, bitch.
3586229	3587670	I paid you cash up front.
3587710	3588450	Now take it off.
3593012	3598173	Well... And Dark Black Forest could be a euphemism for something if you think about it.
3599133	3599714	You know what?
3599734	3600934	We don't need to go there.
3600954	3603215	Someone who isn't very well kept...
3605427	3606828	We've had the C-bomb once.
3610251	3612653	Both boys and girls can have this issue, okay?
3614394	3615676	Shaved ears, please.
3620500	3621520	Anyway, wow.
3622101	3623422	Leave it to this show to go straight to the toilet.
3623442	3625244	Thankfully that song was not on the countdown.
3626625	3630188	Yeah, because heaven forbid that subject came up yesterday.
3633197	3653067	So, I guess I have to, this would be a good time to ask this question, because, you know, DDR Freak, although I don't like to just sit here and talk about DDR Freak, let's face it though, hon, it's a big part of the community, and anybody that listens to this show knows what DDR Freak is.
3653107	3654087	They may not post everything.
3655248	3655408	So...
3656161	3658622	DDR Freak is kind of family friendly, right?
3658642	3662043	And a lot of people get frustrated because they can't type shit and fuck.
3662283	3663203	It gets censored.
3663484	3665024	Although some of the censored stuff is really funny.
3665744	3667005	I personally like doggy.
3667405	3668745	That's just me.
3668785	3669466	I like poopy.
3669546	3670326	I like cigarette.
3670846	3676868	No, the best was before when they first tried to start it, ass turned into butt.
3677268	3681850	So someone would try to type Massachusetts and type M-A-S-S and it turned into M-butt.
3689355	3690116	Now it's just buttocks.
3691957	3693538	And buttocks choosets?
3693818	3694098	I don't know.
3694158	3700802	Anyway, so is there a lot of youngins on DDR Freak, or do you just want to keep a G rating?
3701082	3704905	We're trying to keep it as G rated as possible just for...
3706197	3707038	The overall audience.
3707238	3712321	We get quite a few mentions on all of the different mixes that are coming out.
3712841	3716704	And one of the first places that people are going to go when they look up DDR is going to be DDR Freaks.
3716764	3728991	So we have to kind of try to keep that family-friendly vibe going so that somebody's 13-year-old kid isn't going to be coming on there and their parents are going, Oh my God, is that the word fuck on your screen?
3729511	3730892	You know, freaking out or something.
3732176	3740238	I mean, obviously, there's ways around the filters, and if you're smart enough, you can kind of... Just ask any of the ops in our chat room.
3740278	3740898	They know how to do it.
3741159	3743539	Or just quote somebody's post, and you'll be able to see it.
3745020	3746260	Oh, wait, I gave away a secret.
3749101	3753242	But, yeah, we don't really... We don't really...
3758670	3764673	I feel kind of bad because I dropped the F-bomb on yesterday's show.
3764933	3768294	Kind of forgetting that whole family-friendly vibe.
3768795	3770695	At least I didn't say what Loki said earlier.
3773517	3774837	I'm not too concerned about it.
3775237	3777158	It's no big deal.
3777498	3779979	I was the one sitting there making AIDS jokes.
3781460	3783281	If there's nothing less family-friendly...
3784068	3786710	Or politically correct, really.
3790173	3793436	I just had to ask about the family thing.
3795658	3797760	Here's the catch-22 that we have.
3798400	3805426	We have specifically, when you sign up for the site, when you sign up for the forums, it asks you, it says, I am over the age of 13.
3806907	3811311	And you cannot agree to that unless you're over the age of 13 or you're lying.
3812489	3815791	So, unfortunately, we do have, you know, 11-year-olds, 12-year-olds.
3816072	3819534	I was going to say, how old is the youngest poster, though?
3820415	3821616	We've got, like, DDR Bot.
3821836	3822836	Yeah, wow.
3822937	3824378	And isn't DDR Bot, like, 10 or something?
3824398	3825198	I think so, I think so.
3825518	3825699	Yeah.
3826179	3829001	So, the youngest, I think, is probably around 9 or 10.
3829201	3838047	And it's not... We usually don't cause problems about it unless they're causing issues.
3838107	3840950	And it's just a matter of maturity, typically.
3841110	3841570	I mean, you could...
3842512	3846013	So I've met a lot of 16-year-olds that were less mature than the 9-year-olds.
3846894	3847514	Yeah, me too.
3847594	3855457	And I've dropped the F-bomb quite a lot on DDR Freak on the boards, but, you know, you just... They're going to learn it sometime.
3855937	3857138	It's the way you say it.
3857698	3857978	Yeah.
3858098	3861079	Sometimes it's not what you're saying, it's the way you say it, you know?
3862500	3862620	Yeah.
3862640	3865701	Because I am an instructor of customer service.
3867166	3871329	I can tell you kids, if you ever go out and get a customer service job, your instructor is going to tell you the same thing.
3871449	3872110	Respond.
3872250	3872991	Don't react.
3873511	3873971	Exactly.
3874312	3875813	It's not about what you say.
3876173	3879295	What you say is only 10% of how the information is perceived.
3880216	3882538	And by the way, 35% of statistics are made up on the spot.
3883238	3884439	I thought it was 43%.
3884539	3884840	Whatever.
3886501	3887962	But it's how you say it, kids.
3888302	3892966	You know, I really don't give a crap about your problem, but let's try what we can do to just BS our way through it.
3894162	3894682	Exactly!
3894982	3898444	See, when DarkSakura said that it had a nice friendly atmosphere to it, you know?
3898964	3901005	Who's been doing customer service for too damn long?
3901865	3902625	As I raise my hand.
3905086	3910908	Ironic enough, I just went through a stupid class in school doing that exact same shit.
3912149	3913389	Oh my god, I hated it.
3914550	3917091	All that just for one stinking little piece of paper.
3917111	3918091	Yeah.
3919380	3919460	D.D.R.
3919480	3919580	Freak
3943806	3945767	So tune into that, definitely.
3945907	3947307	I'm sure with a hefty disclaimer.
3948848	3953930	Just the standard disclaimers that... Well, we have a disclaimer right in the intro to the show.
3954030	3960853	It does say, there may be a scene of nudity in this program, and there may be... This program contains naughty language!
3961994	3962774	Well, shit!
3963794	3966776	So, it's not my fault if you tuned in halfway through.
3967016	3968116	You should have been here on time.
3970117	3972238	It's not like I started at a different time every single...
3972540	3973621	That's right, that's right.
3973801	3975202	We're here whether you are or not.
3975822	3979244	And believe me, we've done this show when nobody was here.
3982827	3984588	Alright.
3984628	3988751	Speaking of nobody being here, I happen to know that a lot of folks weren't here for last week's show.
3988891	3990852	I know because I got the ratings, okay people?
3991292	3996376	So, this Friday on DDR Freak, great chance for you guys to catch that episode if you missed it.
3996416	3997356	So Friday, 6 o'clock.
3997877	3999698	All I'm going to say, I don't want to ruin what went on.
4001072	4004713	But we had our own DDR Freak the movie parody thing going on.
4006693	4007914	Priceless, you gotta hear it.
4009554	4012795	Man, that's a subject that hasn't been heard of for years.
4013515	4015396	We just took that subject and ran away with it.
4015596	4020757	I know that it's old news, but somehow it got brought up last week and we just ran away with it.
4021097	4024198	On a random side note that I just remembered again, Rob?
4024618	4024818	Yes.
4025778	4027619	We've been playing DDR for four years now.
4028280	4028840	That's true.
4029161	4032443	Oh my gosh, this is our official four-year anniversary of DDR.
4032503	4032683	Yeah.
4032824	4033084	Really.
4033344	4033684	Today is?
4033944	4034745	Actually, last Sunday.
4034865	4039509	Not today, but the first day we went to play DDR was sometime between Christmas and New Year's.
4039989	4044313	I played for the first time, well, not for the first first time, but, you know, for first regular time.
4044333	4046835	Like our first regular session was... Yeah, that was on the 26th.
4047714	4050195	A little known fact, Iguana Girl and I played our first game.
4050215	4050815	Well, actually, no.
4050855	4053276	Most people that listen to the show know that now because I know it's not the first time it's come out.
4053296	4055536	But we played our first game of DDR together in Vegas.
4057077	4057517	October 2000.
4058217	4058557	October 2000.
4059318	4063559	And then we didn't play regularly until one of us spotted the machine at Golfland.
4063579	4063879	Was it me?
4064198	4064578	You did it.
4064659	4065559	You saw it.
4065640	4066140	You played it.
4066520	4072166	And then I was jealous because I couldn't play it until the day after Christmas.
4072547	4072867	You know what?
4072907	4073448	I remember now.
4074709	4075730	My memory's being jogged.
4075770	4077712	I went down there because... You went there on Christmas Eve.
4077812	4079854	I went there to go play pinball or something.
4080335	4083858	So I was all pissed off because you had two more days than me and that's what I kept...
4085911	4088733	The reason why you were so much better than me is because of those three days.
4088853	4094376	Amazingly enough, suddenly I was passing nine-footers on the third day and just left Iguana Girl in the dust.
4094456	4096037	No, not quite.
4096498	4097418	Not quite, boys and girls.
4097458	4101281	It took me a long time to pass a nine-footer.
4102361	4109826	I remember a certain expedition to a certain golf land in a certain Milpitas to see a certain machine.
4110586	4113108	I remember the first time I met Islander.
4114525	4119207	was at Fanime 2001 when I was cosplaying Emi.
4120787	4121668	No, it wouldn't have been then.
4121748	4124249	No, it was before that, but I mean the first... It was February.
4124469	4124869	February.
4125609	4127650	Right, because of the... The Milpitas trip.
4127910	4130451	Right, but the second time then was at Fanime.
4131152	4131352	Yeah.
4132052	4135113	And I was sort of a little standoffish because of the shirt.
4135973	4136934	He was wearing a flip shirt, wasn't he?
4136954	4137834	A flip shirt, yes.
4138835	4139255	Oh, boy.
4139295	4139555	Oh, boy.
4141539	4142279	It was something to wear.
4142399	4143440	It was just something I didn't have.
4143460	4145841	At the time, I was collecting just random shirts.
4146681	4149702	Look, boys and girls, what you don't know is he went home later and changed the oil with it.
4150842	4154044	I also remember that that's when I met a bunch of people in the community.
4154064	4155664	It was at that particular convention.
4156405	4157325	That was a great convention.
4157365	4157985	It really was.
4158585	4158906	It was.
4158986	4162767	I remember sitting on the floor after two days of sleep deprivation.
4163703	4166564	And then Wendell sits next to me, after two days of drinking.
4168385	4174508	Actually, he was drunk, I was sleep deprived, so we were both in about the same frame of mind, having an interesting conversation.
4175228	4175929	And then he fell asleep.
4177329	4181171	I was actually in the arcade room, and I fell asleep on the chair that was right next to the DDR machine.
4181431	4182191	That big comfy one?
4182432	4183192	Oh yeah, absolutely.
4183492	4189795	And so I was sitting there, and people were walking up, and they were looking at me going, Oh man, this guy's not doing his job.
4191156	4191796	And I'm like, what's...
4197696	4202119	My first DDR machine, though, was the year before that at Anime Expo 2000.
4202159	4204280	They had the third mix there.
4204720	4208442	And I was like, why are the arrows have colors?
4210404	4214286	Because I started playing with the first one on PlayStation in 98.
4215166	4218048	And then the only one I had ever owned was my second mix on Dreamcast.
4220151	4221492	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4250126	4251207	What's this boy song?
4251227	4251927	This song's great.
4251947	4253268	Oh, God, you whored that out.
4254128	4256169	Oh, my God, you whored that out.
4257090	4258251	I was so tired.
4258371	4262773	I whored Boys by SmileDK on DDR USA.
4262793	4266075	And it pissed me off because when we were first starting out, it was hard for me.
4266715	4270337	I was having a hard time doing that on basic.
4270377	4275640	You know, it's like, it's kind of frustrating, you know, thinking back on it.
4275680	4276381	But, yeah, I was...
4276929	4283031	Pissed off at the fact that you kept doing boys, because I was like, you're going to kill me!
4283091	4284712	But I love boys, the song.
4285232	4285913	Yeah.
4286793	4287533	Sure, the song.
4288193	4291215	But then again, I forced you through 20 November about 5 billion times, too.
4291395	4293535	I remember 20 November-a-thons, yes I do.
4294216	4294716	Good times.
4295256	4301799	And our massive attempts at trying to take on the board, the high score board.
4302379	4302479	Oh.
4303385	4304085	Those are the days.
4304466	4307387	Back then, that was when Konami was doing their net ranking, right?
4308448	4316713	And back then, you could score the same on a basic song as you could on a maniac song.
4318614	4319815	Or it was something like that.
4319915	4328059	No, I think it was... I think what it was is that you... Honestly, there weren't that many people playing DDR yet.
4328440	4332362	So there wasn't that many people on the scoreboards, and we were kind of like, wow, if we could...
4333191	4336134	I remember at least a couple times that I had to do EOTC five times in a row.
4336154	4336674	We were in the top five.
4336694	4336794	What?
4336814	4337095	Were we really?
4337115	4337755	We were in the top five.
4337815	4338176	Were we?
4356502	4358324	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4382816	4385638	I worked my ass off to get first place on that damn machine.
4385718	4386118	I remember.
4386758	4388799	Jamie was the buns, because she was first and last.
4388819	4389499	I was first and last.
4389719	4396222	And Brad, lanky style, on Thursday Night's Program, was the meat, because he was in the middle.
4396262	4398263	He was third, and I was the fruit, second and fourth.
4398323	4399464	You know how I got first place?
4399664	4399864	How?
4400424	4404666	I ended up getting first place by doing Dynamite Rave doubles basic.
4406967	4407967	Oh, I see.
4408067	4410408	You were one of those ones that whored Dynamite Rave in the beginning.
4410428	4411689	I was one of the ones that whored Dynamite Rave.
4411729	4415390	But then again, I was very proud because Dynamite Rave was the first five-footer I could do in doubles.
4415570	4415930	That's all right.
4415950	4417110	You know what song I used to do it?
4417850	4418691	Love to Me.
4424352	4424772	All right.
4425433	4427873	Nostalgia City.
4428073	4429914	Remember when all the cool kids were doing that?
4430514	4431695	I was never a cool kid.
4432555	4433515	You never did that?
4433795	4434575	Not even once?
4434775	4436356	I'm too fat to do that.
4437697	4438277	I'm serious!
4438677	4440598	I would have fallen over if I tried to do that.
4440618	4443139	I seem to remember that you did some kind of white girl freestyle.
4443379	4447460	Yeah, I was doing white girl freestyle that didn't require me to actually have to hit the pad with my hands.
4448061	4449741	I mean, I... well, alright.
4450201	4452522	When you get down there, it's hard to bring yourself back up.
4452542	4453803	It's hard to bring yourself back up, yeah.
4453823	4454523	It's one thing to fall.
4454683	4456804	And you gotta keep in mind that when I first started, I was 270.
4457084	4461345	So it took me quite a long time to lose my initial 30 pounds.
4461705	4466027	And, you know, unfortunately I gained more than that back.
4466147	4466307	But...
4467028	4468289	I've lost it again, so it doesn't matter.
4469509	4470690	We're a clean slate now.
4470750	4470870	Yeah.
4471230	4471750	Yeah, alright.
4472991	4490278	But for those of you guys that weren't, you know, you've only been playing DDR since like 4th, Max, whatever, and you kind of missed out on those USA days, if you want to see what we're talking about, go to DDR Freak, look at the step chart for Love To Me Basic, and you'll see several portions of the song.
4490498	4491319	The left-right jump.
4491559	4494240	Right, you have left-right jumps, and then down-up jumps.
4494955	4503341	So you would jump on left-right, and then hand-plant backwards, and then go forwards.
4503962	4507144	Are you demonstrating on cam, even though it only updates every 30 seconds?
4507184	4507585	That's right.
4508926	4512348	Islander will demonstrate in super slow motion for you to see this guy's on cam.
4513129	4517552	He looks like he's going to take a shit.
4517632	4520474	Hopefully we'll see something on cam.
4522936	4524237	He's taking a backward shit.
4527293	4529494	Sometimes I wish we were a TV show, I really do.
4530674	4531014	Alright.
4532435	4534315	So that we could get booed by the Nilsons?
4536476	4540177	Please, our ratings couldn't be any worse than G4 Tech TV, come on.
4543077	4545898	When you're getting beat by the Golf Channel, okay, something's wrong.
4546959	4550279	You know, Tech TV came up in conversation over lunch today.
4550559	4550920	How so?
4551220	4552320	The Soul Calibur dates.
4554662	4555443	Soul Calibur dates?
4556103	4562307	Dan was telling me about something they had on Tech TV where they had someone going on a blind date with Cervantes from Soul Calibur.
4563008	4564028	What are you going to have for dinner?
4565069	4566490	I want your soul!
4567491	4568671	We never had Tech TV.
4568691	4572854	It was G4 and then G4 basically assimilated Tech TV.
4573134	4574475	Oh, I didn't see it.
4576797	4577077	Alright.
4577577	4578238	Well, you know what?
4578298	4584382	If any G4 Tech TV people are listening, as much as we give you guys shit, we would sell our souls to you in a minute, so call me.
4588249	4589790	I think now's a good time.
4589870	4590991	On that note, let's go to a break.
4618203	4621787	We could do some music that would remind us of the good old days.
4624489	4630575	So let's start it off with... I'm looking, I'm looking to see if I can find it.
4630695	4631716	I think it's this one.
4632316	4633778	We'll be right back after this, boys and girls.
4634138	4637381	And everybody, when you hear this song, practice.
4637561	4640784	Get up off your chair and practice the move that Islander was just showing you.
4640824	4641245	We'll be back.
4659611	4662005	What's your name, Brian, and what's your storyline?
4743900	4752198	Dreaming, dreaming, grooving, if you know what I mean, it's moving on the scene, alright Take the bumping, take the whining, take the moving, I'm with the DarkSakura King
4775999	4776920	Thanks for watching!
4822455	4823557	Thanks for watching!
4857231	4858773	DarkSakura.com
4888951	4890332	Thank you for watching!
4921658	4924859	With apologies to Iguana Girl, I can't resist this next one.
5020152	5030354	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5031934	5033575	Sorry, Jess, I just couldn't resist.
5033615	5037696	But it's been like a good, like what, three, four years since you heard it last, maybe?
5040356	5042817	Come on, so many memories, so little time.
5044137	5044837	How can I choose?
5045868	5047449	That's still the sluttiest song ever.
5049369	5051190	I'm being told F you in the chatroom, thank you.
5051290	5053191	Hey, we'll get to the F yous a week a little later, alright?
5058413	5061073	She's not... I'm Sawi.
5062134	5062654	I'm Sawi.
5063895	5064415	I'm Sawi.
5065355	5066115	I will be Fawi.
5067756	5068656	She's typing messages.
5069156	5070357	Oh, she says I'm not cute.
5079133	5080034	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5097057	5098018	and a couple minutes here.
5098238	5102000	I opened it up for a particular person to get through, which I'm hoping to hear from in just a second here.
5103441	5110946	In the meantime, I thought maybe we would kind of start moving into the sim update for this week.
5111306	5116909	I know Loki's got a lot he wants to say for the sim update, so I'll let him get started, but just keep in mind I might have to pick up a call midway through.
5116969	5117190	Sorry.
5118070	5118570	Thanks.
5118590	5122473	I'm glad I'm top priority there.
5123553	5124314	Anyways, um,
5125154	5129439	Yeah, this week there's a few things as opposed to the normal nothing.
5130981	5141092	DDRUK, still new, no new sim files, they're still waiting on beginner steps for the Ultramix 2 stuff, but it's close to being done, so that's good.
5142227	5160719	Other than that, there's also a little theme that just got released on Bomani Cell right now, only because DDR Mania X is down, and that theme would be Techno Fiend 3, that's right, the most kickass skin ever for Step Mania has now released its final version of it, and it's awesome.
5161997	5166059	Now, I don't even play Step Mania, really, and I know what Techno Fiend is, okay?
5166099	5166740	It's that good.
5167020	5168401	Like, I really think the skin is great.
5168841	5172223	I think it just, whoever did the work on that, kudos to you.
5173220	5197144	It is the sexiest skin out there, and you gotta check it out, it's just, it's really awesome, lots of humor and little Easter eggs thrown in the background there, but, um, it's just, it's really nice looking, they've added, um, it's just completely redone almost, and I don't know how to describe it, it's just very well put together, very, um, optimized, and just runs really well, um,
5198874	5200776	But yeah, you'll have to go check it out.
5200816	5205379	It's kind of hard to find right now, only because, you know, DDR Maniacs is down.
5205980	5214386	So what you need to do is go to my style, go to their DDR sim file section there, and just do a search for Technofiend.
5214406	5218109	You'll find it probably, it's actually on the second or third page on there right now.
5218789	5221692	And you should find it to download, and it's awesome.
5221872	5227096	It's a good 14 megs, but it is a really good sim skin.
5228270	5244811	Other than that, there's also the OSC3 Plus Remix, which is the step-file contest where they had all the songs where they're taking new steps or they're being remixed or whatever.
5245602	5272954	that's available for download also on my style and they also have their own download pack that's available right now with just I think a couple more sim files and it's DR5Key Classics is the theme for this one so check those out over there as well and that's all okay for those that don't really know what Technofiend is all about what exactly makes this skin so damn cool
5273837	5274578	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5290678	5293939	I want to say Star Wars because it has a lot of Star Wars parodies in it, but not really.
5293999	5296279	I mean, it's just very different.
5296319	5297899	It makes DDR all futuristic.
5297919	5301620	It makes it feel like a 2010 game or something, you know.
5301640	5303400	It just gives a very futuristic theme to it.
5303540	5304681	That would be the way I would put it.
5305741	5306301	And it's sexy.
5307301	5308982	Yes, that would probably be the way.
5309262	5313802	It looks like what a new, if they were to reinvent DDR and release it now, what it would look like.
5314923	5316443	Well, maybe not, because, you know...
5318068	5325350	If they were to, you know, spend the amount of time that they did on, like, finding good music with designing the interface, this is what it would look like.
5327510	5327690	Alright.
5328030	5329691	Any comments from anybody else about Techno Fiend?
5329711	5331211	I know... It was purdy.
5331851	5332732	You saw a little bit of it?
5332772	5333532	It was purdy.
5333672	5333932	Yeah.
5334312	5334732	Very pretty.
5335892	5337733	And, Jazz... I felt excited.
5338373	5340113	You've used this Techno Fiend before, yes?
5340373	5340833	Not yet.
5340873	5344854	This is the first time I've seen it, but I'm definitely going to download it when I get back to Walnut Creek today.
5345295	5345495	Yeah.
5345855	5346315	It's sexy.
5346595	5346955	Oh, yeah.
5347015	5347335	It's sexy.
5349116	5349436	All right.
5351198	5351518	What now?
5351578	5358645	I guess we're going to go ahead and get into the cage match, and we'll come back, and hopefully that call we can get to, and then... The new game.
5358665	5359606	We're talking about the new game now?
5360087	5360887	I know, I keep putting it off.
5360907	5361928	All right, let's talk about the new game now.
5362089	5362749	Let's talk about the new game.
5364378	5369901	So I finally got to check out this game for the PlayStation 2, thanks to Islander and Iguana Girl bringing it over for me.
5370601	5375244	It's called Technic Beat, and this game's actually been out for like two months, right?
5375284	5379466	It's been out a little while, but I'm just now getting to see it, because I somehow completely missed this game.
5379886	5384428	I heard about it like a month ago, but I'd really missed it somehow.
5386269	5387770	You're pretty familiar with this game, right, Jazz?
5387950	5388130	Yeah.
5388590	5389891	Tell us about how this game works.
5390635	5393896	Well, the way this game works is very interesting.
5393996	5403479	Basically, you choose a character, and you start walking around on a kind of liquidy-type surface, and then circles will appear.
5404179	5406920	And then little circles will appear coming from it.
5407420	5412042	And if you think of the big circles as, like, guide arrows in DDR...
5413086	5441752	and the little circles coming out towards the other circle like the actual arrows then that's what it's kind of like it's basically you want to hit the ripples right so basically you have a little character you start running around and start hitting the ripples and the game is full of a bunch of Namco original songs like old school Namco stuff like Thema Daruga and Pac-Mania Pac-Mania which is awesome Dig Dug even Point Blank but now there's kind of a tie into Bomani isn't there here
5442230	5442470	Pac-Mania
5467245	5468306	That I heard you play was awesome.
5468426	5469026	That was good.
5469046	5470928	And that was by Sampling Masters Mega, right?
5471148	5471328	Probably.
5471348	5471768	One of the two.
5471888	5472249	One of the two.
5472309	5472649	Yeah.
5472869	5473169	All right.
5473830	5474430	Good stuff.
5475791	5477773	It was a little... Like, it was different, though.
5477853	5481235	It was very different compared to other music games I play lately, which is good, though.
5481555	5487560	I think they need to get away from the moving thing towards the line and stuff.
5487580	5489881	You know, every game's starting to look like DDR.
5489901	5493264	It's a lot more obscure, and that's what I like about it, because it has...
5493922	5497563	Yeah, like you said, a lot of things are basically wait for it to get to this screen.
5498363	5498723	Okay.
5499203	5499403	Yeah.
5499463	5499743	Okay.
5499803	5503744	This one you have to run around and some characters can't run fast.
5504004	5506225	And you have to kick the notes around sometimes.
5506305	5511146	And then depending on which note you hit, you'll actually kind of change the pitch of the music.
5511186	5511446	Yeah.
5511526	5512627	Which is pretty cool, I think.
5512707	5516087	It's kind of fun to sometimes play it and you get to remix your own a little bit.
5516247	5516388	Yeah.
5516428	5518388	Kind of like Amplitude allows you to do in a way.
5518408	5518728	A little bit.
5518748	5519068	A little bit.
5519088	5521609	You can have a remix mode in the game where you can make your own stuff.
5521729	5522189	Right, right.
5522209	5522349	Yeah.
5522589	5524490	And there look to be a lot of modes in Technic Beat.
5524510	5526010	I didn't really get to play with a lot of the others.
5526050	5527451	Have you checked out some of the other modes?
5527471	5534273	Basically, it's basically the normal stuff they have, like non-stop mode is in there, free mode, like 2DX is in free mode.
5534313	5542716	After you play a song, it's unlocked in free mode, which is hard because there's not really a way to keep track of the songs you've passed in regular game modes.
5542736	5545497	You're kind of guessing which ones you've passed already in free mode.
5545817	5549538	Then you go back and check, oh, that's unlocked, yay, oh, that's, nah.
5550185	5555487	So, yeah, it gets a little annoying, but still it's a great game because it has about 80 songs.
5556607	5557548	And it's only $20.
5557808	5560389	Yeah, it's one of these budget games.
5562290	5563450	Namco did this one, right?
5565051	5570513	No, it was Mastiff and Eureka, which are basically a branch off of Namco.
5570633	5576535	Okay, but Katamari Damashii was also by Namco, and I think these two games came out together, actually, didn't they?
5576555	5576635	Yeah.
5577402	5581006	This only came out in the same manner.
5581106	5585010	Like, it wasn't released that much because they didn't think there was going to be a high demand for it.
5585671	5589635	And there hasn't been, so it's kind of like... At least for Technic Beat, there hasn't been.
5589675	5593520	Now, Katamari Damacy, they probably thought the same thing going into it, but boy, were they wrong.
5593640	5594040	Oh, yeah.
5594461	5594661	So...
5596031	5622795	and I but Technic Beat and we've got a lot of folks in our chat room saying they never even heard of this game yeah so and it's not you know not surprising at all but it is a new music rhythm game that's out there and it's kind of different the way it works you're not going to know a lot of the songs in there are going to be unfamiliar to you unless you play a lot of old school 80s arcade games if you're a mame whore like you have you're a mame whore you've got that multi what does that mean multi arcade machine emulator that is exactly it oh I'm oh I remembered um
5623644	5633454	If you've got that on your computer and you have all these ROMs from crazy places of games you've never heard of, which you're not supposed to do because that's illegal, boys and girls, and I'm not encouraging you to do that.
5633474	5639139	I'm just saying if you've already done it, then you probably are familiar with a lot of these old games and they've remixed a lot of these old themes, which is cool.
5640901	5642783	So, check it out.
5642963	5643223	It's only $20.
5645683	5651465	Wow, this would be a great opportunity to sell it on our website, but we just, you know, we're not that smart.
5652546	5653006	Cry.
5653626	5653886	Oh well.
5654587	5660689	I did see that game while I was Christmas shopping, and the first thing I thought was, ooh, should I get that?
5661109	5662049	No, what if it sucks?
5662690	5665831	But now I know, so I might just have to go down and get it tomorrow.
5668072	5673734	Now, speaking of music games that suck, I know Islander, you got a chance to play one not too long ago, right?
5676465	5677686	Music games that suck?
5678046	5681888	Yeah.
5682069	5683149	Oh, Jesus Christ.
5683169	5685691	Let me give you a hint.
5685711	5686371	Let me give you a hint.
5687072	5691315	All those people complaining about GameCube DDR, there's something out there for you.
5692055	5693816	And really, you're not missing out.
5694937	5698179	It's by MadCatz, who, you know...
5699625	5709347	for a long time have been making third-party controllers and such, and memory cards and other various accessories, but this being their first game, it was lacking.
5709467	5710428	Boy, was it lacking.
5711148	5712008	That's putting it lightly.
5712528	5713608	Oh, yes, very lightly.
5714169	5715329	It was a pile of steaming poopy.
5715689	5721070	Well, yeah, the one saving grace was that the soundtrack wasn't bad.
5721090	5723331	I liked a lot of the music in there.
5725463	5730947	Dear Lord, do I really have to play the full-length, five-minute version of Parents Just Don't Understand on eight arrows?
5731187	5732048	Do I really need to do this?
5732988	5734469	Do the arrows even make any sense?
5735590	5742535	Okay, imagine we were just discussing Technic Beat, how it has a circle and another circle that comes out to meet it.
5743656	5746678	Your arrows are set up in a circular manner.
5747138	5749159	You have up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals.
5750020	5754103	And the arrows appear from the center and move outward.
5755049	5756330	It's very strange looking.
5756931	5759032	Which is confusing to begin with, a setup like that.
5759332	5765657	Now, another option is the scroll mode, which makes it turn, which turns it into DDR, but up and down are switched.
5768379	5769420	And that was really confusing too.
5770141	5771282	Yeah, exactly.
5772343	5776606	That was like just, uh, I'm not, damn it.
5781322	5781782	It was real bad.
5782122	5788064	As a matter of fact, I played it for about maybe 30 minutes, looked at Iwana Girl and said, this is a piece of crap.
5788944	5795105	Threw it back in the box, went back to GameStop the very next day and said, you know what, let me get a game that is actually cool.
5795906	5796926	Can I try this in for Mario Party 6?
5800607	5806348	And sure enough, I was able to do that and get some money reimbursed to me, and I was very happy about that.
5807165	5807865	MC Groove's Dance Graze
5825750	5826411	How much was it?
5827052	5827512	At the time, $60.
5829153	5830234	Right now, it's going for $50.
5830514	5833157	You've got to be kidding me.
5833197	5834478	Does it come with a pad or something?
5834518	5835719	Yeah, it comes with a game and a pad.
5835739	5836139	Okay, but still.
5836179	5837320	Yeah, exactly.
5837540	5837881	Exactly.
5838141	5839022	Oh, it was horrible.
5839342	5841624	But even the Mad Catz pad wouldn't be worth $50.
5841724	5843265	It sucks.
5844126	5846808	I mean, it actually worked well, but I was like, oh.
5848009	5849270	Just, oh, it's just bad.
5849911	5850952	People, stay away, please.
5853991	5855673	Get On The Mic Get On The Mic
5867498	5868999	The game itself is actually pretty interesting.
5869019	5883425	It uses a lot of, I mean, of course, it's all hip-hop, but it ranges from stuff like the newer stuff, oh gosh, like Turn It Up and some other strange things, or like Party Up DMX, to like old school stuff like Humpty Dance.
5885246	5896554	and the characters are just hilarious because there's this one stage where you're just starting out your career and you're in your bathroom looking at yourself in the mirror trying to be all hardcore.
5896674	5897895	Wasn't that a scene in 8 Mile?
5898495	5899096	Yeah, basically.
5899896	5910204	And it's funny because your boombox is on the shelf and it's bouncing and if you're doing well, the whole room starts bouncing and having fun.
5910224	5911005	Yeah.
5911565	5912786	Yeah, pretty much.
5913487	5914988	It's like Parappa's bathroom level.
5915569	5916770	Basically, there you go.
5917350	5917771	There you go.
5918071	5920373	Except he's not rapping about having to go to the bathroom.
5920433	5922775	No, but that's honestly my favorite song in that game.
5923175	5923756	I know, I know.
5924036	5924837	It's awesome.
5924897	5925477	It's a great song.
5926398	5929321	In the rain or in the snow, I really gotta go.
5929821	5938689	That made me laugh so hard I peed a little.
5940970	5944372	But yeah, people, please stay away from NC Crew's Dance Grace, please.
5945253	5952517	That reminds me, I got to check out a little bit of Donkey Konga this week, because one of my buddies got it for Christmas, and he said, you have to play, you have to play it.
5952537	5957480	So he brought it over, kind of like how you guys brought it over a couple weeks ago, but this time I actually had time to play it.
5958080	5960681	I feel bad, because you guys brought those games, we didn't even really get to them.
5961242	5963563	But, got to play a little more Donkey Konga.
5963603	5968366	Now, I'd seen it at E3, and really, the game was pretty much what I remembered at E3.
5968386	5970107	There wasn't a whole lot different, but it's just...
5970535	5971095	It's fun!
5971396	5972056	It really is.
5972256	5975938	There's some songs in there that are really freaking cute.
5976338	5981101	Like, there's a cover of, uh, I think I love you, so what am I so afraid of?
5981121	5985623	But it's all, like, Happy Britney style, kind of, but not, like, Britney bad, but, like, you know.
5985663	5987724	Yeah, but it has that, like, cute Nazi feel to it.
5987844	5988265	It does.
5988965	5992227	We gotta get some of those songs and get them on Orange Lounge Radio, because there's some really cute Donkey Konga songs.
5992287	5993467	Absolutely, that would be cool.
5993668	5999991	But then there's some, like, really, really, like, okay, this game is obviously for five-year-old songs, because there's, like, the Campfire Medley.
6002602	6005784	There's Foster's Medley in Taiko Drum Master too.
6006224	6008045	And I'm like, what the hell is this?
6008765	6011286	I came this close to picking up Taiko Drum Master today.
6011326	6015348	I saw it sitting on the shelf and I was like, it's calling my name.
6015368	6016348	Get it, get it.
6016408	6020430	But then I was like, I must save money for something else.
6021951	6022711	I want that game.
6023952	6026493	But I still want a freaking second pair of maracas.
6027979	6030400	They stopped making Samba de Amigo like three years ago.
6030420	6032000	I wanted them to bring out the tambourine one.
6032721	6034141	Seriously, the tambourine game?
6034321	6036422	I would be all over the freaking tambourine game.
6036542	6041604	This coming from somebody who has played Dance Dance Revolution, Para Para Paradise.
6042684	6046986	I've played just about almost every music game out there.
6049824	6053686	The Tambourine Game is the gayest music game I've ever played.
6072125	6073306	I hate the eye toy.
6100854	6101474	So travesty.
6101935	6102755	Alright, just curious.
6104056	6104296	Alright.
6106337	6106738	Alright.
6107778	6108899	Yeah, how about that cage match?
6108939	6109819	How about that cage match?
6109839	6111040	Let's get into the cage match.
6111660	6112581	We're going to get into it here.
6116843	6124068	Alright, last week in the Orange Lounge Radio cage match, we were missing a host, so we didn't get a song, because Jamie was out sick.
6124228	6124628	Got the name.
6125328	6125469	Oh.
6125929	6127310	Shakato Tambourine, I think.
6127330	6127670	Oh.
6127690	6127770	Oh.
6128160	6130121	So, what, shake that tambourine, basically?
6130141	6130581	Basically.
6130662	6130902	Alright.
6131322	6146010	Anyway, we were down to host last week, so we let you guys, the listeners, do something that you have been begging us to do for years now, and that is a chatroom choice song for the cage match.
6146391	6151914	So we let a random chatroom listener, which was, I believe it was Big Red Pimp ended up picking this, right?
6151934	6153615	And Angel, you helped them find it or something?
6154437	6161040	Well, no, actually he already had it, and he told me what it was over private message, and I'm like, ooh, that's cool.
6161420	6162621	So it was all him.
6163501	6167803	Alright, so we had everybody in the chatroom submit a random entry, and we picked one at random, and it was this one.
6168523	6173545	And sure enough, you let the chatroom put a song in the cage match, and of course they're going to vote for it, so that song won.
6173565	6177327	Oh, I thought you had a comment.
6177347	6177507	So...
6178786	6184891	What that means is that Cage Match is all screwed up now because we have a chatroom choice sitting there in the Cage Match.
6184951	6187973	So what we're going to do is this.
6188814	6194658	Since Jamie stepped aside last week for the chatroom choice, I will step aside this week so the chatroom choice can be in.
6194698	6198001	And if, for whatever reason, it wins again, Loki will be out next week.
6198161	6198381	Okay?
6199097	6201199	That means you just didn't want to pick a song to sing.
6201459	6203120	No, because I have a good song.
6203540	6206142	I have a good song, but I'm going to step aside this week.
6206162	6208023	Did you listen, by the way, at my suggestion?
6208243	6209084	I haven't had a chance to.
6209124	6211005	I'm going to hear it for the first time tonight, so we'll see.
6211125	6211686	Alright, here we go.
6212566	6215628	So song number one, last week's winner, is a group.
6215928	6217950	You guys know this one if you listen to any J-rock.
6218030	6221872	Larkin Seal did this song, and the song is called Ready, Steady, Go.
6221932	6224274	And no, it's not anything like the Paul Oakenfold one, okay?
6224294	6224374	Okay.
6225646	6230788	Alright, so again, the way the cage match works, we play three songs for your listening pleasure or displeasure.
6231309	6240713	You pick your favorite, and your favorite song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Launch Radio's Hermione Music and More program, which runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on this station when we're not live.
6241373	6242794	Alright, so here it is.
6244034	6251177	Oh, and remember, you've got to be in our chat room to participate, so head on over to www.orangelaunchradio.com and click on chat now so you can participate.
6251638	6253038	Alright, that being said, here it is.
6253098	6254319	Song number one, a clip
6254986	6257008	Because it won last week, so you already know what it sounds like.
6257048	6258349	A clip of Larkin Seal.
6258409	6259149	Ready, steady, go.
6284008	6293893	Kato wa kirenai kizu kakaekonde ite mo Chotto ya soto ja tamashii made wa ubawasenai Aoka no nukou de kimi ni deaeta nara Nani kara hanasou
6315129	6315669	Hey, everybody
6356264	6358945	Alright, that was song number one in tonight's Cage Match.
6358985	6366848	The chatroom choice, which I'm stepping aside for, is that that song can continue to stay in Cage Match until it gets voted out.
6367288	6369529	That's Larkin Seal with Ready Steady Go.
6369609	6373990	And so let's get into tonight's two challengers that will be battling that song.
6374971	6377311	Well, I just have to make one comment since I wasn't here last week.
6377371	6377552	Yes.
6378432	6380473	I do really like Larkin Seal.
6381573	6384274	I don't like that as the opening theme for SMA.
6385814	6386975	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6413996	6416756	So, chat room did okay on that one, so I'm not going to complain.
6417037	6417357	Alright.
6418297	6418757	Here we go.
6418977	6421517	Song number two tonight is going to come to us from Loki.
6421877	6423298	And, Loki, what are you picking tonight?
6424538	6427218	I'm picking a... First, I found the remix album.
6427258	6429279	Then I found the original CD.
6429299	6442781	But this is from a group that's calling themselves ProdigyRemix.com And it's actually a group of about four different remixers that completely remixed the brand new album from Prodigy, which is
6443911	6445732	Always Outnumbered and Never Outgunned
6787705	6792046	Okay, I just want to preface, before we judge the song, I want to preface with this.
6792646	6795887	We've been doing the cage match for about two years now.
6796707	6800027	I have been waiting that entire two years for a moment like this.
6801788	6805168	That being said, Jamie, what did you think of that?
6806228	6807109	It stopped!
6808469	6809069	Zero!
6811149	6812630	Islander, negative two.
6813630	6815070	Jazz, girl.
6817606	6818366	You don't like girls.
6819267	6819647	Zero.
6822069	6822790	Guana Girl.
6824451	6826493	That was something from Prodigy?
6832478	6834139	Oh, I was waiting for a number, I'm sorry.
6835541	6835881	Zero.
6836181	6836461	Oh, okay.
6837662	6838043	Loki!
6839984	6840365	You know...
6841528	6845251	What's sad is that this remix version was better than the original.
6846051	6847592	That's the worst part of it.
6848413	6848873	You know what?
6849193	6850774	I just picked this song because I had nothing else.
6851134	6853216	And next week is when I'll have the good song.
6853476	6854937	That's what I was trying to download.
6855537	6859240	But, you know, I just found it too late.
6859260	6860180	So, it's alright.
6860941	6862822	But I give it a zero just to go with everyone else.
6867045	6867585	You know what?
6868931	6875693	Loki, after all the shitty songs I've put in the cage match, because there's been a few, I'm really glad that it's not just me.
6875873	6876253	Zero.
6876993	6877274	Angel?
6879034	6880454	Negative 999, that's all.
6880995	6882955	Oh my god, she didn't do something nice.
6884156	6887076	Holy crap, you've given the 10 to some really bad stuff.
6891298	6894999	I mean, I'm not meaning this in a mean way, but I'm surprised.
6898420	6898720	I don't know.
6901416	6908140	We'll remind you though, your singing actually did get voted in for the weekly pick.
6909040	6911682	Yeah, I think your singing is better than girls.
6911862	6913042	I would like to point this out.
6913063	6915424	Girls, girls, girls, girls.
6916164	6917705	Loki now can attest to this.
6918225	6926990	This is the first time a song has ever been put in the cage match and gotten zeros from every single judge, including the one who put it in.
6930146	6933347	We have our show's history tonight.
6933467	6939069	I think we've had one where I put it in and everybody else gave it a zero, but I gave it a hundred to balance it out.
6939669	6941870	I don't remember what song it was, but I know I've been there.
6942490	6943571	But remember, you know what?
6943991	6945011	Our opinion sucks.
6945692	6948132	Will the chat room vote it in just to be funny?
6948292	6949913	And let me tell you, that would not be funny.
6951013	6953014	We'll find out because it's really up to the chat room.
6954269	6955009	Jamie... Jamie...
6978638	6990466	I forgot who it is that did this again, but there was a song, and I think, I really do think that this is one that I had on a tape that I bought at the Limited back when I was in my senior year of high school, taking French.
6990926	6993028	And I bought the tape because it was all in French.
6993048	6996610	I was like, oh, cool, I can use it to, you know, practice.
6997511	7000713	It's a song called Jolitaxi that I really liked.
7000833	7007878	I mean, it was a cute song, and I was looking for it and found a remix of it, and this has actually been sort of edging me back into trance, believe it or not.
7008479	7011261	So this is a trance mix of Jolitaxi.
7011841	7015244	Alright, now the full name of this is huge, so I'm only going to read it once, kids.
7015304	7015684	Here it is.
7016165	7023450	The artist, Aria Posey, and the song, Jolitaxi, and it's the Jan Wayne remix radio cut.
7024851	7025171	Okay?
7025671	7026512	Wow, that's pretty damn long.
7026572	7027393	Alright, here it is.
7027773	7028373	Song number three.
7028433	7028814	Enjoy.
7031336	7032897	Jolitaxi Jolitaxi
7039470	7054024	In your yellow castle, you know all the streets by heart In your quest, the goal is four days It's the game, the game, the game, the game
7168280	7171745	Sake, La Musica Jo, C'est La Rumba, Le Duroc au Mambo
7248152	7250894	All right, let's see what everybody thought about song number three.
7250954	7253356	We'll just call it Joe LaTaxi for short.
7253977	7254237	Jamie?
7255178	7257279	I've just been listening to that song on repeat.
7257480	7264085	I mean, actually, it was... I was listening to it earlier today just trying to keep myself in a good mood, and I give it a nine.
7264406	7264646	I mean...
7265351	7266932	I'm still not quite in my trance minute.
7266952	7273434	It does have a couple of slightly overly trance-y annoying things in it, but overall it's such a good song and I like the original.
7274495	7275935	Did you want to get your thought in before you head off?
7275975	7277136	Okay, alright.
7277216	7277556	Jazz?
7278456	7279437	I thought it was okay.
7280077	7284759	It seems very kind of J-trance-y to me, like something Ayumi would do a lot to me.
7285319	7290361	And that's okay, but I don't know, it got a little too trance-y for me, just generic trance-y for me.
7290401	7291942	But it was still good, so I'd give it like a 7.
7293022	7293363	Alright.
7293983	7294263	Islander?
7295407	7297568	You know, that was actually the same score I was going to give it myself.
7298369	7301690	I did like it a lot, and I liked it a lot better than some of the other stuff that was played.
7303652	7305372	That being said, yes, a good solid 7.
7305412	7308574	That sounds very good.
7309034	7312496	You know, that song was kind of odd, but it was odd in a good way.
7312616	7315758	Like, it was kind of one of those songs I just go, huh, that's kind of neat.
7316739	7319980	So, and honestly, this week it better win, so I give it a 9.
7322728	7323028	I like it.
7323048	7323509	It's bouncy.
7323609	7323869	It's happy.
7323909	7324109	It's an 8.
7339275	7343057	Alright, you've heard what we have to say, now let's hear what you have to say.
7343157	7348500	You will pick the winner by placing your vote right after this recap of the three songs you can vote for tonight.
7348580	7351502	Song number one, Larkin Seal, Ready Steady Go.
7359206	7363709	Song number two, ProdigyRemix.com, Girls, the Idiotex Remix.
7365109	7367851	Song number three, Girls...
7371253	7373313	Song number three, Jolitaxi.
7376254	7376774	Girls.
7382975	7383416	All right.
7383976	7385396	Loki's crying foul.
7385756	7386776	Loki's crying foul.
7386816	7388157	Here's a little bit longer.
7394058	7394458	Girls.
7394598	7395219	All right, there it is.
7395419	7395739	All right.
7397895	7398795	I don't know what I'm going to do.
7398815	7399775	I might change my F.U.
7399795	7400416	music to that.
7400436	7401216	Alright, fine.
7427601	7428842	Place your vote now, guys.
7429262	7437745	Hopefully somebody will remind you there in the chat room how you can place your vote if you haven't done so yet.
7442647	7442967	All right.
7443948	7444428	Moving on.
7445788	7450350	I was going to take a call on the Skype line, but I'm going to hold off on that for just a minute because I just remembered something.
7450370	7452851	I was like, oh yeah, let's wait on it for a minute.
7452951	7455812	So we'll do that Skype line thing in a little bit.
7455832	7458352	We're going to go to a quick break, I think, and then come back.
7459093	7466095	Before we go to the break, though, I thought I'd scan around, see if there's any big news going on here we should talk about.
7468616	7469957	What about the, oh yeah, tell me about this.
7469997	7472037	This is another game I got to play for the first time this week.
7472097	7472918	The Guy Game.
7472958	7473978	Tell us about what's going on there.
7474637	7474837	Lovely.
7474877	7475698	Lovely, lovely, lovely.
7504329	7506230	Dun, dun, dun.
7507210	7508571	So now the game's getting recalled.
7508631	7508991	Oh, yeah.
7509031	7511072	So it's being yanked off store shelves with the quickness.
7512432	7518474	I was able to snag an Xbox copy for my cousin for Christmas, and I told him, if you ever sell this thing, I will fucking kill you.
7519455	7521776	You could eBay this probably in about a year for some big cash.
7521796	7522116	Who knows?
7522516	7522916	Seriously.
7522956	7523857	It's a collector's item now.
7524117	7526157	It's right up there with, like, Custer's Revenge now at this point.
7526358	7526658	Oh, yeah.
7526698	7527078	Seriously.
7527338	7527738	Oh, yeah.
7527938	7528258	Definitely.
7528919	7529239	All right.
7529939	7530039	Um...
7531343	7534045	We're going to go to a break now.
7534065	7538727	And when we come back from this break, we'll go to the Skype line and we'll hear who won tonight's cage match.
7539348	7541269	And we're going to get into the FUs of the week.
7542690	7543790	Busy show still ahead.
7544131	7545151	So don't go anywhere.
7545211	7546892	We will be back after this break.
7546912	7549674	And I haven't even really thought about what kind of theme we should do this break.
7549754	7553236	Maybe... No, we're not going to play girls again.
7556141	7557343	Let's play... I don't know.
7557403	7559485	I want to play a song we don't usually play.
7559906	7561588	How about some Beatmania 5-key stuff?
7561628	7562929	We haven't heard some 5-key stuff in a while.
7563210	7564832	Here's something from Beatmania Final.
7564872	7565773	This is Fellows.
7565993	7567115	We'll be back after this.
7607563	7608905	Thank you for watching!
7672453	7685523	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma

7958147	7962970	We are back here at Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 125.
7963831	7965892	And let's find out who won tonight's cage match.
7965992	7967853	I know you boys and girls are really excited.
7968854	7969734	Alright, let's find out.
7971475	7975358	By one vote, this song won.
7978786	7984027	I can't say, I'm sworn to secrecy.
8007322	8008984	One vote over song number two.
8011226	8012167	Some folks trying to be funny.
8012187	8013929	The chat room is full of fun cards.
8013949	8015911	Song number one, not forgotten about.
8016071	8020475	Not forgotten about by any means, but a little bit left in the dust there with the rest of the controversy.
8020555	8021556	So, sorry guys.
8022257	8027162	But maybe we'll do the chat room choice again sometime at a later date.
8027302	8027602	Girls.
8029404	8029824	Girls.
8031406	8031686	All right.
8034901	8056696	I think what we're going to do is we're going to go to the Skype line in a minute here We're going to do that and also we're going to be doing the FUs of the week momentarily So send those FUs over to Sky via private message and we'll take those In the meantime, let's go to the Skype line Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio Is this me?
8057617	8061079	No, this is me Hi, how are you?
8061399	8062180	Good, who's this?
8062873	8063653	I'm on the air.
8063933	8065174	Hi on the air, how are you?
8065794	8067255	I'm, I'm, I'm moist.
8069395	8070115	Aren't you always?
8071636	8073176	Well, when I think of you, yes.
8075117	8077338	And the minute I hear Rob's voice, it shrinks up.
8078818	8080419	Tell him who you are, asshole.
8081779	8082680	I'm the asshole.
8085161	8086421	Don't you want to be my friend?
8086441	8089162	Asshole formerly known as the asshole of the dance.
8091024	8092125	Don't make me come back there.
8094446	8098868	The one and only and never replaceable asshole.
8101350	8104251	Yeah, come on, say it, say it.
8105011	8111135	Travis from UnderSedationLive.org Oh, you like that, don't you?
8111235	8111515	Yes.
8112155	8113396	Oh, you like that bitch, don't you, huh?
8114611	8115652	What do you want, Travis?
8115672	8117393	Did you just call in to taunt us?
8118093	8120675	Well, actually, I had a rant, but I'm going to get to that in a second.
8120795	8121095	Okay.
8121115	8124637	You guys were talking about, obviously, you had an annoying song on earlier.
8124817	8125318	Yes, we did.
8125338	8128439	I guess it was something that was catastrophically annoying.
8128560	8129160	Yes, it was.
8130000	8131121	Well, I found something worse.
8131441	8131741	Okay.
8131761	8135724	Isn't this annoying?
8136885	8137085	Okay.
8143337	8144397	Sounds like a game, doesn't it?
8144738	8145098	Yeah.
8146218	8146979	Can you even hear it?
8147579	8148039	Yes, I can.
8148079	8148439	I can hear it.
8148759	8148999	Good.
8153321	8153941	That's worse.
8154702	8155322	What is that?
8156102	8158203	That's from The Life Aquatic.
8160564	8162465	Oh, so that's the trailer in the movie The Life Aquatic?
8163145	8165266	Yeah, that's from the movie The Life Aquatic.
8165286	8167647	Is that supposed to be going under the sea music?
8168187	8168467	That is.
8168487	8169668	That's going under the sea music.
8170939	8173061	That's the music that's playing in Bill Murray's helmet.
8173921	8174862	It was kind of funky.
8174882	8176823	That's right, that was on the trailer.
8177364	8179125	Yeah, and he starts doing that little butt shake.
8179926	8180986	I need to see that movie.
8181127	8184509	It was, I don't know, the girl's song, not funky.
8184609	8185550	That song, funky.
8185810	8186150	I don't know.
8186190	8187171	Dude, that one's kind of groovy.
8188072	8188692	If annoying.
8189433	8192555	But I'm amazed Rod didn't play this when that song was on.
8193075	8196398	In my opinion, and I have an opinion on this show, they are losers.
8198816	8201999	Rob, your man is back in what, two weeks, three weeks?
8202039	8203880	Yes, Simon, my idol, yes, he's back.
8205701	8207563	I'm actually going to try and watch American Idol this year.
8208383	8209304	I didn't watch it last year.
8210805	8213167	But I do, I have an FU.
8213487	8218931	Okay, we're going to be getting into that soon, so why not give us a preemptive FU here?
8219871	8221052	Oh, a preemptive FU?
8221072	8227437	Whatever, a pre, pre, pre, I don't know, fine, we'll call it a foreplay FU, how's that?
8228888	8230409	Okay, well let me transition.
8230609	8230849	Okay.
8233171	8233371	Okay.
8234312	8237694	I had to transition into FU mode.
8237794	8241517	Because you're like the only outlet I can go to when it comes to video games, is you guys.
8242217	8243918	Well, that's what we're here for, okay.
8244499	8250103	Okay, so I thought I'd get this out in my, you know, out in the open now.
8250623	8254145	I'm fucking, can I say that on this show?
8254245	8255066	Yes, you fucking can.
8255686	8256467	Oh, thank you fucking much.
8258064	8265270	I'm sick and fucking tired of all these jack-ons on Halo 2 who are fucking cheating out the ass with standbys on their cable modems.
8266471	8267932	How do you cheat in Halo 2?
8268873	8274598	You put your cable modem on standby in multiplayer games like Capture the Flag, Assault, and all that shit.
8275842	8280047	So while everyone else goes into reconnection oblivion, you're still playing your game.
8280387	8289137	You got the bomb, you got the flag, you go right to the goal point, set the bomb off or capture the flag, take your modem out of standby, and boom, you've suddenly got a point.
8289737	8290158	Genius.
8292526	8294867	Thank you for telling all our listeners how to cheat at Halo.
8294907	8297088	I'm sure they're all going to go do it right now.
8297148	8306811	What everybody needs to do is go to Bungie.net, the people behind Halo 2, get on their forum boards, report people that do this shit, and get these people banned off Xbox Live.
8306931	8311873	Notice also, Graves, those people that mod their controllers for burst firing in Halo 2.
8312533	8313413	I've seen that also.
8313473	8314714	That's ridiculous.
8315414	8316114	That's not cheating.
8316354	8317815	That's just competitive play.
8320049	8320549	I see.
8320629	8321610	Meaning that Travis does it.
8322030	8323370	I see, okay.
8323390	8325551	That's called taking advantage of the scenario.
8326632	8328472	Just like grabbing the flag through the wall.
8328672	8329693	That's fun as hell.
8331874	8335455	Is it true that Bungie erased everybody's data sometime in the past couple days?
8335495	8337876	Like all the Rumble Slayer stuff went bye-bye?
8338336	8338856	I heard this.
8339237	8342358	If they haven't already done it, they are in the process of doing this.
8342378	8345119	Because I've talked to a couple people in the community and...
8345848	8361722	Bungie, they're even trying to find a way to work around the standby mode and all of us who play Halo 2 Online thought that was the neatest thing in the world was when your game goes into lag and you disconnect you don't lose the game entirely you just pick up where you left off everything's fine and you just keep on playing
8362202	8377255	Well, unfortunately, these little, you know, 14-year-old asswipes who, you know, get off on gushing on pictures of Lindsay Lohan in Entertainment Weekly, who have no life but drinking Yahoo and eating Ding Dongs, have found this little loophole through their cable modems.
8378976	8388745	So, you know... These, by the way, being the same 14-year-olds that get on Xbox Live and while you're playing them go, Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga!
8389446	8391188	And they're as white as you, Rob.
8391968	8392829	Exactly, they are.
8392929	8394391	Whiter, in fact, if you can believe it.
8394411	8395932	Yeah, and you can hear it in their voice.
8395952	8407382	And what's funny is when I'm playing with one of my friends, who happens to be a man of color, listening to him crack up, listening to these guys go, Oh, you nigga this, you nigga, oh, I got you, nigga.
8407723	8413688	You know, and he just, he takes great pride and pleasure in coming behind them during the game and just beating them down.
8414963	8415684	Jack Black, NotFunny
8439186	8468165	stuff like that I mean, us white people, we got Jack Black and unfortunately, the African American community has Dave Chappelle alright wait, wait, wait hang on you have to go back a little bit with the Jack Black stuff and you have to go back to Mr. Show he ruined every episode he was in no way, no way, I'm sorry don't put your dick in these holes that's classic
8468786	8470627	Jeepers Creepers, he ruined that one.
8471828	8473489	He ruined the farmer bit.
8474449	8474809	No.
8475350	8476410	He's ruined all the shit.
8476450	8477751	I just, I don't like him.
8478391	8478972	I hated him.
8479392	8483835	I can't stand Tenacious D. Have you even bothered to see School of Rock?
8484495	8485195	Yes, I have.
8485275	8490458	Unfortunately, my place has a habit of showing it multiple times on the electronics section.
8491019	8494561	So, I unfortunately am cursed with seeing that movie.
8496122	8498603	So, how are you doing, Jeff?
8499693	8500273	I'm in pain.
8500893	8501053	Why?
8501094	8502554	What's wrong, hun?
8502714	8504455	My left side hurts for no apparent reason.
8504875	8506775	And it has been since, like, Friday.
8508616	8511297	So I'm trying to determine if it's because of working out too much or not.
8512457	8514418	Well, you know what it could be.
8515658	8516399	Now that I think about it.
8516499	8517399	I'm not pregnant.
8517919	8518920	No, no, no.
8518980	8520000	I don't have AIDS.
8521120	8521981	It could be a tumor.
8522881	8524121	It's not a tumor.
8524141	8525122	It's not a tumor.
8525322	8525542	Okay.
8525562	8525722	Okay.
8529315	8529876	I could play.
8530916	8532237	I envy your soundboard.
8532297	8532937	What can I say?
8532997	8535278	We don't have anything that fancy.
8535398	8539701	This is why I came up with the other idea, which I'm emailing you all.
8539861	8544563	I've set a date tentatively, and I hope you all are capable of participating.
8544583	8545624	I'll have to pencil it in.
8546464	8546704	Yes.
8547144	8549085	Just pencil in the 29th of January.
8549806	8551947	Wow, that happens to be my birthday weekend.
8552327	8553048	Hi.
8553788	8556449	Good planning on my part, huh?
8556509	8557790	Potentially bad, but we'll see.
8559651	8560171	Oh, I see.
8560372	8561332	Your birthday's more important.
8561352	8561472	Okay.
8561512	8564494	Well, I'll remember that.
8564514	8570718	At least, you know, I'm only turning 28, you old fart, but it's still important.
8576022	8579264	I think Travis just shot himself, ladies and gentlemen, live on air.
8579724	8580004	No.
8580565	8581045	Oh, darn.
8581505	8584728	No, have you even told... No, it's just Texas.
8584748	8586389	You get all sorts of gun noises out there.
8586589	8586829	Oh, yeah.
8588127	8589768	You forget, we live in shit-kicking Texas.
8592189	8593210	Have we even told them what?
8594690	8597472	Well, I mean, I know Jess knows, I know you know, I know Jamie knows.
8597972	8600213	Anybody else around knows about the little thing?
8601674	8605675	Yeah, I... Angel says yes, she does.
8606196	8606916	Okay, alright.
8607356	8609617	And Ross knows, but he doesn't realize he knows.
8609677	8610598	People know, they know.
8610678	8610978	Anyway...
8612133	8616837	I don't want to steer too off track here, but I do want to say some folks in the chat room think you're pretty funny, Travis.
8617217	8618899	You have some fans in the chat room already.
8620480	8621180	Yeah, exactly.
8622341	8623522	That's what I said when I read it.
8625123	8628546	If you guys think Travis is funny, then you know what?
8629056	8630037	Scream me along!
8633819	8635361	You can listen to Travis' show.
8635421	8636521	It's Under Sedation Live.
8637522	8645308	www.undersedationlive.org It's where Iguana Girl and I got our start on the internet radio and DarkSakura to some extent as well.
8645748	8647689	I was the number one most often guest.
8647749	8648250	I know you were.
8648410	8648610	Yes.
8648650	8649130	Hey, Rob.
8649170	8649371	Yes.
8650952	8651992	Hey, I just got one thing to say.
8652993	8655255	You really think you can do all that bullshit you just said?
8658671	8659891	I'm just trying to help you out, buddy.
8661472	8662432	What the hell are you doing?
8662752	8664432	It was a weird echo.
8664592	8664812	Go.
8666612	8667113	Stop that.
8669073	8670093	I'm hanging up on you.
8670333	8670893	No, you're not.
8671093	8674674	Use the force.
8675874	8678014	Do you honestly want to get into that type of war with me?
8679675	8680615	You know you'll lose.
8683675	8685376	You're going to be in the process, too.
8685396	8685636	What?
8688154	8689895	You're being in the front.
8689915	8691856	Turn your goddamn echo thing off.
8693616	8694317	Hey, Rob.
8694617	8694897	What?
8699639	8701039	I can make everybody sound like chipmunks.
8702700	8703820	I hate you.
8704121	8709023	And then I can do 3D effects.
8711163	8717266	See, this is what happens when I waste my money on toys that I don't need instead of, you know, getting stuff that my daughter really needs, like diapers.
8718284	8720387	It's kind of hard wrapping her up in brown paper bags.
8722309	8724051	Let's say Walmart on the side.
8726254	8727275	Actually, never mind, I won't go there.
8728717	8730199	Anywho.
8731300	8734404	Don't forget, the 29th, if that's a conflict, let me know ahead of time.
8734504	8735825	I will attempt to reschedule.
8736606	8737147	Okay, okay.
8737546	8740687	But we need to test out how it's going to work in sound.
8741087	8745329	Our people will be in touch with your people.
8745409	8747029	Oh, get your people with my people?
8747189	8747409	Yes.
8747769	8748910	I have no people.
8750550	8751791	You have little people.
8755132	8758393	And Rob just has people that come around him going, Ooh, Rob's cool.
8758733	8759233	Want to touch him?
8759453	8759913	I touched him.
8759933	8760533	Want to touch him?
8760673	8761514	Ooh, I touched him.
8763154	8764735	Who hasn't touched Travis?
8764835	8765035	Travis.
8766320	8767901	What the hell is going on on your end?
8767921	8770541	It sounds like you guys are pushing some weird button.
8770561	8772062	No, you've got the echo thing on.
8772742	8773342	No, I don't.
8775203	8776803	I turned off all my echo shit.
8777503	8780424	I don't know what's going on.
8780464	8781345	You scare me, man.
8781625	8783725	Alright, thanks for calling in, Travis.
8784045	8784946	I gotta go.
8784986	8785286	Later.
8785846	8786526	Bye.
8788627	8789567	That was not on my end.
8791580	8792840	Oh look, it's gone!
8793480	8794220	Magically!
8794381	8795801	I wonder how that happened.
8797081	8797581	Oh no.
8798261	8800001	I swear he does that just to piss us off.
8800442	8800942	Yeah, I know.
8801462	8806183	Alright, again, if you thought that was funny, I don't know why, but, no, I'm kidding.
8806763	8809423	Understationlive.org, we do love Travis, and of course Jenna.
8809463	8810463	We love Jenna even more.
8810603	8811123	I mean, honestly.
8811143	8812124	Because Jenna is hot.
8812264	8813544	It's all about Jenna, really.
8814044	8814804	Jenna is hot.
8815424	8816324	Jenna is a hottie.
8816764	8817184	Totally.
8817524	8818505	It's all about Kira.
8818765	8819065	Alright.
8819645	8820585	And Kira's a cutie.
8822645	8828888	If you want to find out what we were talking about there with the 29th, just head on over to understationlive.org and there'll be more information soon.
8829168	8830029	And it involves us.
8830789	8832190	So, you'll see.
8834090	8834611	Exactly.
8834711	8835091	Alright.
8835691	8843835	Oh, I'm so glad that we get to go from that phone call into this next segment because this next segment is a good one to follow that up with and it's the FUs of the week.
8844655	8849117	It's our chance to rant a little bit about the things that have been pissing us off today or all week long.
8849598	8850298	And Jamie...
8851053	8854234	Why is it that we have to do these FUs of the week every single week?
8854775	8856375	Because of girls.
8872182	8874022	My first FU of the week goes to your dryer.
8875123	8877564	My second FU of the week goes toward the fatigue flu.
8879195	8880476	for making me feel like crap.
8880516	8882917	Another one goes to stress.
8884999	8888801	SD goes to distance, money.
8890142	8895605	But I am very glad, though, that I am getting a raise with my new job, which is probably going to go to pay for bills.
8896192	8899014	Humongous F you goes to GameStop Incorporated.
8900515	8906079	F you goes toward the holidays in general for screwing with my head.
8908040	8914064	And F you goes toward stupid fuckers who drive really stupidly in the rain.
8914765	8922149	Like, let's go... You know, it's one thing to drive five miles under the speed limit when you're, you know, in the rain.
8923250	8924291	Five to ten speed, you know...
8924881	8927543	You know, miles, depending on the conditions, is smart.
8927563	8930645	30 miles under the goddamn speed limit!
8930665	8931166	Someone was going 20!
8932827	8941873	And, like, unless you, you know, if your car is so bad to the point where you cannot drive in the rain, you need to either get a new car or take the damn bus.
8942274	8942654	Okay?
8943775	8948258	Um... It's... It was just one thing after another.
8948298	8953682	I'm a very easily frustrated driver, though, so that could just be it, but... And another one goes toward...
8954375	8959137	People who have 20 items when it says 15 items or less in the damn express line.
8960238	8960718	Okay, I'm done.
8964400	8969322	Sorry about that, I got a little bit of Loki's music in there because I ran into the other room for a second there to try and fix that out of the situation.
8969803	8971864	But now we will get to Loki's FUs of the Week.
8971904	8972264	Here we go.
8973845	8978127	Um... Yeah, I'm... God damn it, I don't have enough cord.
8978247	8979767	Okay, I'll make this really quick because I'm cooking stuff.
8980248	8980348	Um...
8981728	8982249	Let's see here.
8982369	8983389	Fuck you, stupid drivers.
8983430	8986412	Fuck you to the fact that I don't feel good right now.
8987112	8988453	I think I caught someone's cold.
8991456	8993877	Fuck you to work because they're not paying me enough so I have to get a new job.
8996379	8997200	I'm sure there's some other stuff.
8997240	8998221	I can't remember right now.
8998241	9000462	I had a lot of stuff earlier, but hey, we're going to keep it short.
9000823	9001743	That's my gift to you.
9003285	9003745	All right.
9010595	9038244	I like to give an F you to people that try to drive in the rain because it's obvious that nobody knows how to do it because whenever I get out there and I try to drive and it's been raining just nobody knows what they're doing so I just what's wrong with people what is it about rain oh my god water falling from the sky I need to start cutting more people off and driving 25 under the speed limit or 25 over the speed limit and coming up on your ass and you know refusing to pass you I hate people and I hate parking lots
9039133	9043155	A big F you to Roseville and this place that I call Whitey Plaza.
9045536	9047357	Because, damn, what a bunch of yuppies.
9047477	9048738	I just, oh, I hate that place.
9048878	9050418	Anyway, that's pretty much it.
9050819	9052459	Otherwise, everything's pretty good.
9052980	9054440	And I can't really complain a whole lot.
9054500	9055501	So we're going to move on.
9056401	9059103	And going around, let's start it off with, who's got a mic over there?
9059123	9059263	Jazz!
9062259	9065341	F you to people who do not signal when they merge.
9066242	9071025	Holy crap, I have never seen so many people do that here and try to cut you off.
9071526	9072587	It is ridiculous.
9073267	9073747	Damn.
9074888	9080873	Also, F you to people who don't signal when they're making a left turn that isn't protected.
9081693	9082374	Oh my god.
9082814	9084775	People in Milpitas do this all the time.
9084835	9088478	I'm trying to get out of a shopping center and it's raining, so it's hard enough to see what's going on.
9088838	9090980	And people keep turning and turning and I...
9091776	9117283	and I can either go straight or left and I'm assuming they can too I'm like oh my god what are they gonna do no one's signaling but oh my god they're all turning so I'm like oh no oh no and finally they all go through and they all turn and I'm like fuck you all and I'm just going my merry way uh I'll do FU to Taiken 5 because I suck at it uh yeah that's about it alright Islander
9118271	9123637	The only FU I can think of really is FU to my car doors for not closing all the way and letting rainwater in.
9123937	9128142	I have to keep a stack of newspapers on both seats to keep it dry.
9128542	9129543	It's really annoying.
9131385	9131806	I want a girl.
9133492	9135434	F you to my side for hurting right now.
9136854	9142358	I don't know what caused it, but it's really, really, really, really annoying and it's painful and I want it to go away.
9142378	9146320	F you to my butt muscles for tweaking out.
9147721	9151764	F you to body sculpting class because it was extremely evil and...
9152584	9156506	and Awful and I have to do it again on Tuesday and it sucks.
9158567	9160907	FU to Size 20 Pants That Don't Fit.
9164289	9166990	FU to Lane Bryant for carrying Size 20 Pants That Don't Fit.
9168871	9172092	FU to Lane Bryant for charging $52 for four bras on sale.
9172152	9172252	And...
9179404	9184107	FU to my vacation time coming to an end soon from school.
9185668	9188109	And that's about it.
9189070	9190491	I need to second the school FU.
9191571	9194533	Alright, let's see what DDR Angel has to rant about tonight.
9196214	9197235	Third about the school thing.
9197275	9199236	Okay, no, fourth because Jazz just said third.
9199396	9200156	Okay, never mind.
9201697	9207761	FU to the spare TV in my parents' house not working because then I couldn't play 2DX and stuff at my parents' house.
9208897	9235315	FU to the internet going down while I was at my parents house because then I couldn't do anything of that so I was like bored and stuff and that sucks aside from going to people's houses and whatever but yeah okay and I suddenly forgot everything yeah FU to school starting in two weeks and that's about it let's go on over to the chat room and see what they're pissed off about tonight
9238174	9243800	Uh, let's see, um, Misty says, F you to my grandpa.
9244781	9246202	I don't want to learn to drive from you.
9246302	9251167	Your skills may be leet, in your opinion, but your temper sucks too much for me to put up with you at times already.
9251347	9254310	I don't want to put up with your shit when I have to put up with the other retards on the road.
9255030	9255951	F you to Stepmania.
9256412	9259174	Alpha 24 was the most recent one that actually worked for me.
9259615	9262858	Now it won't load at all, and I can't find any older alphas to download.
9265014	9268055	Dork says, F you goes to work for cutting my hours.
9268295	9270195	I so can't wait till school starts again.
9270315	9273256	Also, F you them for not giving me my Christmas bonus.
9273896	9277197	F you to myself again for having a girl over and not doing anything about it again.
9279897	9280977	You just need to touch her boobie.
9283338	9283738	Just kidding.
9284498	9289239	MPQ says, F you to feel the magic on Hell Mode.
9289579	9292420	Those of you who have played know exactly what I'm talking about.
9294525	9298807	Allusion says F you to Bill O'Reilly for being a douchey blubbering vagina.
9299468	9306732	F you to the new Tilt Arcade that opened up and turned out sucking with its fabulous arcade games such as Skee-Ball and generic racing game number one.
9307252	9312575	Also F you to Going Back to School Tomorrow and sorry to Iguana Girl for saying community college sucks.
9312775	9313075	Heart.
9316417	9319759	DJ Ranma... You better apologize to Miss Dark Sakura also.
9320800	9321080	Better?
9321807	9323188	You can send those cards and letters.
9323328	9324029	And me too.
9325790	9327111	You're just fucked all around.
9327471	9327871	Alright.
9328752	9332935	DJ Ranma S says, F you to my job for fucking me over, you bastards.
9332975	9334096	I will have my revenge.
9335937	9340140	Misty says, Oh yeah, F you to school starting January 10th.
9340400	9341561	I'm going to refrain from comment.
9341961	9344763	Raym says, F you MS, depression, and ADD.
9346965	9350567	K-Dash says, F you to New Year's, cause I was all alone.
9350728	9351248	Oh, I'm sorry.
9352669	9359954	Well, next time tune in to see what's going on with the internet radio, because we're around sometimes on New Year's, so I know, what little concession.
9362795	9367879	Jaded2005 says, F you to people who think I know everything about computers when they can't work them.
9369419	9377284	And lastly, BlackDevilerX says, F you to going back to school tomorrow, and F you to being jet lagged.
9379466	9379886	All right.
9383359	9384220	Thank you for watching!
9408991	9418857	We were talking about home versions a little earlier, so I thought maybe we could play some good songs that were on home version stuff.
9422159	9423660	I'll see if I can find it.
9423780	9428103	Alright, Loki says I have to play a certain song from 2DX, so maybe we'll squeeze that in somewhere too.
9429323	9430804	We will be back after this.
9430864	9434046	We're going to start it off with a very popular track from DDR Extreme USA.
9434106	9435247	We'll be back.
9453921	9454282	DarkSakura.com
9477099	9479243	Thank you for watching!
9500171	9526232	Simply being loved, yeah, yeah Simply being loved, yeah, yeah Simply being loved, yeah, yeah Simply being loved, yeah Simply being loved, yeah Simply being loved It's more than enough Simply being loved
9528267	9536651	It's more than enough Simply be loved It's more than enough
9659751	9662394	Thank you for watching!
9685709	9689912	I heard you were in love, but I knew we were meant to be
9814421	9818585	Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
9818805	9820527	Do you want to be staffed by Hollywood?
9821047	9823230	No!
9823330	9824691	Do we care what people think of us?
9825332	9826993	No!
9827153	9828655	Do we want people to kiss our ass?
9829115	9832058	Yes!
9833199	9835101	Extreme Bomani Radio.
9835301	9835922	That's us.
9836482	9838024	Orange Lounge Radio.
9840595	9843056	Alright, we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
9843096	9844696	We're kind of getting into the home stretch.
9844776	9849858	But, you know, some folks in the chat room were kind of asking tonight if we were going to do an Ask Orange Lounge segment.
9849878	9851058	And I said, you know what, sure.
9851559	9853399	It's been a few weeks since we've done Ask Orange Lounge.
9853579	9854780	We did Listless a couple weeks ago.
9854800	9855740	We did Match Game and stuff.
9855760	9857821	So, we haven't done Ask Orange Lounge in a little while.
9857921	9860922	And this is a segment where you can just basically ask us whatever you want.
9861342	9865263	This is a great way to get us to actually talk about DDR, if you want.
9866143	9867624	or you could go out of left field.
9867664	9870065	Maybe you have a relationship problem you want to ask us about.
9870525	9872826	And Jamie will give you straight up advice, really.
9873286	9874266	Well, I ever.
9874586	9877427	You may not want to hear it, but she'll give you the honest answer.
9877607	9879068	But remember, we love you.
9879408	9880248	That's why we're honest.
9880368	9880828	For dinner.
9881249	9881609	All right.
9882909	9885170	So that being said, let's get into it.
9885330	9889492	And we kick it off with me making an ass out of myself with a little opening theme song.
9895976	9898937	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid questions.
9899398	9902639	What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
9903159	9906301	Is someone bound to ask a stupid dating question?
9906901	9910023	I really hope not, because DarkSakura will tear him a new butthole.
9911824	9912284	Girls.
9918707	9919987	What are you cooking over there, Loki?
9920028	9920708	I have to ask.
9920848	9921808	Loki's garlicky.
9921908	9925070	Loki's cooking, it smells like garlic, and now all of a sudden I'm like, garlic.
9928041	9929242	Oh, you're doing the fried rice thing?
9930283	9931964	Oh, his fried rice.
9933025	9933425	Beautiful.
9933585	9934806	He learned from the Benihana chefs.
9935307	9935627	All right.
9940571	9943053	Let's move on to question number one.
9943734	9944214	Illusion.
9944234	9945395	This is a question from Illusion.
9945515	9946035	Brace yourself.
9947537	9948678	You knew this would be random.
9949838	9955263	If you throw a blender off of the Leaning Tower of Pisa and it lands in the Gulf of Mexico...
9955993	9958935	Who did the rapping in that one Paranoia remix Loki did?
9958995	9961256	I think it was Paranoia Revolution or something.
9961657	9963958	He said it would be the last one, if that helps any.
9964919	9972103	So, Loki did this remix of Paranoia Revolution, and I guess as... I remember this remix that Loki did a while back.
9972163	9975025	It was, um... What the hell was the name of this, Loki?
9975045	9977366	Can we tear you away from the kitchen for just a minute to ask you about this?
9977506	9978007	The rapping?
9978707	9980368	Yeah, what was the rapping in it from?
9981649	9983970	That was from a song actually called Revolution.
9984030	9984651	It's by BT.
9984671	9984931	Okay.
9986031	9990134	I forget who he has that does rapping, but he's on a bunch of different albums.
9990994	9994877	I think it said who his name was in... I don't remember.
9995457	9999379	Scotty D. It's not Scotty D. That's retarded.
10000180	10001281	I can't remember.
10001301	10003422	Let me see here.
10004503	10011647	While you look for that, let me play a clip from Paranoia Revolution.
10011947	10013128	The rapping was towards the end, right?
10013903	10016905	Okay, here's a little clip of Paranoia Revolution so you know what the hell we're talking about.
10016925	10021749	This is a Loki remix that you can find on his website, which is what, LokiFusion.tk still?
10022249	10022770	Alright, here it is.
10062498	10065399	Ooh, very sexy clip there from Paranoia Revolution.
10065439	10067839	If you want to download the whole thing, it's LokiFusion.tk.
10068419	10071160	And I've heard that clip, the revolution will be televised.
10071180	10072640	I think I saw that on a bumper sticker once.
10072660	10075080	That's what the guy said in one part there.
10075520	10075780	All right.
10076821	10077301	All right, all right.
10078321	10083002	While Loki does some more research on that, I'm going to go ahead and move on, and you can come back to this question a little later.
10083342	10086963	But it's from BT, basically, the short answer to your question.
10087363	10089143	And Illusion would also like to add...
10090587	10096973	On a note, and I'm going to play some apologetic music to match his mood here on this note here.
10097054	10100517	So I'll play some very solemn apologetic music here.
10101398	10102659	Oh, no, Loki found it.
10104875	10106436	God damn, who the fuck is this?
10106956	10130967	It's, it was in the song, uh, Mad Skills, uh, Mike Cheka is the name of the song that was, um, on his album, Movement and Still Life, and they actually, I think, in the song, he says who it is, because, you know, they do that stupid, you know, shout out crap in it, so, um, I don't remember who he's partnered with, but it's the same guy that's on, like, all these albums, and, uh, Movement and Still Life would be a good one, the
10134979	10144023	Alright, let me get to another note from Illusion here.
10145384	10149046	He would like to offer a formal apology.
10150486	10152687	He says, I'm sorry.
10153267	10156029	And I'm adding the crying noises because I know he's making them up.
10157669	10161251	I'm sorry to everyone that I pissed off
10162897	10170745	I too will be going to community college, though I'm not too excited about it, nor would I be excited about any college.
10171346	10172387	So, there you have it.
10174189	10176071	A formal apology courtesy of Illusion.
10177432	10180795	And there will be a replay of that apology next week on DDO Freak Radio.
10182757	10184579	In case you missed it or you want to tell your friends.
10185100	10185420	All right.
10189291	10191632	K-Dash has a question about Beatmania 2DX.
10192153	10202698	I'm planning on buying 2DX and I would like to know if anyone has any tips for me concerning whether I should get a flip top or just a Japanese PlayStation 2 and the best place that I can purchase them from.
10203119	10203519	Thank you.
10203719	10205420	Japanese PS2 and CSX.
10206668	10208209	I would also go with the Japanese PlayStation 2.
10208429	10217874	The flip tops are becoming a little more... Like, you know, if you'd asked us this two years ago, we would have said straight up, do not trust the mods, go for a Japanese PlayStation 2.
10218555	10222417	They're a little better now, and I think there's more out there that you can kind of trust, but...
10223061	10223221	Islander
10245453	10250798	Yeah, no, I second the whole, you know, getting the Japanese PS2 wholeheartedly.
10251138	10252600	I don't trust the flip-top still.
10253020	10253541	I don't know why.
10254682	10262088	And make sure when you buy it, you buy a Japanese PS2, not an Asian PS2.
10262589	10264150	There is a difference.
10264451	10264851	Thank you.
10266167	10280210	Even though it is cheaper and it looks like it's going to be a good deal for you, you actually have to use a converter because it is different power than the Japanese PS2, American PS2 voltage.
10280310	10287491	So you end up putting that amount of money back into a good converter that you don't fry your PS2 with.
10288331	10289071	Very good tip.
10289111	10291252	A lot of something people don't think about sometimes.
10292112	10292352	All right.
10292719	10298281	So, as far as that goes, it sounds like we kind of give the consensus, you know what, just go and get the Japanese PlayStation 2.
10299061	10300402	It's cheap, and you won't regret it later.
10301422	10307344	And, was she asking what style, too, or did she just ask other tips, or he, I'm sorry, I don't know if it's he or she, sorry.
10309685	10311625	I'm not sure, so we'll just move on.
10312386	10316367	I would say as far as styles are concerned, because usually that's another question that goes along with it, is what style should I get?
10316847	10320428	You really just have to evaluate the song lists and look at the one that has the songs you want.
10320508	10322069	As far as beginners go, though...
10322449	10327411	I wouldn't go with 3rd or 4th if you're a beginner just because 5th and later had more beginner-friendly modes in it.
10328551	10338174	Overall, I would say as far as song selection, actually 8th style doesn't really have too many beginner-friendly songs, even in Light 7.
10341455	10343636	I would actually point people to 5th style.
10344156	10346136	I'd say if you're going to start anywhere, start with 5th style.
10346156	10350918	It has a lot more beginner-friendly songs, except that 6th style does have the beginner mode in it.
10352432	10354415	So, it really depends.
10354775	10357539	I mean, as far as song selection, 8th style's got a bajillion.
10358560	10360283	You know, 7th style has a whole bunch.
10361264	10363127	But I think overall you're best starting with 5th or 6th.
10364946	10365506	A goal for 2005.
10365567	10367268	Do you have any goals that you'd like to share?
10392108	10393009	I'll start it off.
10394189	10396431	I really want to get to Maniac Mode this year.
10396491	10396871	That's it.
10397632	10398192	I gotta do it.
10398993	10406157	And probably get better at 2DX as well, although I don't really know where I'm going with that, but let's just stick to DDR first.
10408138	10413402	My goals for this year are very simple, and actually I met one before the year began, because my goal was to be in a new job.
10413482	10418065	One of my resolutions I put in my live journal was to have a new job, and I actually got that right before...
10419037	10423082	Goal number one is to lose 50 pounds.
10423563	10427668	Goal number two is to be enlisted in the Air Force or Army Reserves by the end of the year.
10428209	10430532	At least to get my man over his anti-military thing.
10433415	10434837	Anything you guys on the couch want to share?
10435506	10436387	I have three of them.
10437787	10441409	Two of them are most definitely going to happen and the third one is going to take a lot more work.
10442689	10446070	Goal number one, I'm going to graduate again this year.
10447211	10459456	So basically my goal is to pass my last class that I have to take in order to graduate and hopefully convince my teacher that I don't have to be there for the day of the final because otherwise I'll be stuck here instead of at E3.
10460916	10461437	Painful.
10461877	10462677	Yeah.
10463258	10470142	Second one is, this is the year that I'm going to be getting out of debt, thankfully, so I have to finish that out.
10470382	10480309	I would anticipate it probably will be done by about August, so I'll actually be 28 years old and completely debt-free, which is not something that most 28-year-olds can say.
10480329	10480849	Exactly.
10481449	10482590	And I'll own my own car.
10483451	10485412	No making payments or anything like that, and that's
10485892	10488354	Coming up in about two months.
10488874	10498841	And then my third, and probably the most important, and the one that's been the biggest problem for me, I'd like to lose another 80 pounds.
10498921	10506146	Even if I don't lose the weight, and just get down into size 12 or 14, I'd be ecstatic at that.
10506506	10515432	But I have been working my butt off to try to lose the weight, and it's hard, especially with my conditions and everything.
10516152	10516953	But I'm going to do it.
10518154	10518614	Good luck to you.
10518634	10519455	We're here to support you.
10519675	10529163	Orange Launch Radio, anybody that is trying to do that right now, your friends are the best support you've got for things like that, I think, sometimes.
10529963	10531264	And you can look to for encouragement.
10531404	10540572	And we definitely encourage those of you guys that want to be more fit, and especially Jamie is always telling you guys to go outside once in a while, even though you do have to sit indoors to listen to this show.
10540632	10541412	It's Sunday night.
10541532	10544695	Okay, that was the Lord's Day to rest, so that's fine.
10545175	10545596	www.DarkSakura.com
10564159	10564439	DarkSakura.com
10582014	10588157	For anyone who uses LiveJournal, I've made, and I actually am thinking of making this just a big support group.
10588697	10596120	I made a community called GeekFit on LiveJournal, and I just made it this afternoon.
10596800	10604283	But just for anyone who wants tips, advice, just to share what you're doing, what's working for you.
10604323	10610266	You don't even have to post every day, but I would encourage people to make use of this that I've opened up for everybody.
10611128	10615424	LiveJournal.com slash community slash geekfit G-E-E-K-F-I-T
10615968	10617949	GeekFit, I love the name, that's going to be cool.
10618789	10620249	So LiveJournal is a great way of support.
10620369	10625670	Also, a lot of folks in our chat room are bringing up GetUpMove.com, of course, the DDR fitness site.
10626150	10633452	Although GetUpMove.com, a little bit commercial because it's kind of a red octane thing, but I have kind of looked at, I've lurked on the forums a little bit.
10633512	10634752	I think the forums are really cool.
10635133	10644555	So I think if you want to find people in the same boat that are kind of using DDR as a way to get more active and lose weight, I think the forums are really great help over there on GetUpMove.com.
10644575	10645235	So check those out.
10645675	10646055	Definitely.
10648196	10649077	Boy, okay.
10649577	10652698	I guess we should move on or else we're going to run out of show time and not get to everybody's questions.
10652718	10654439	We've got to breeze through these last few questions here.
10654479	10655059	Any other goals?
10655079	10657160	Anybody want to get out there?
10657320	10669365	I do have some other goals and that would probably be just I want to... I'm kind of looking forward to 2006 where I want to buy a house in 2006 and not be a renter anymore.
10669426	10672127	So I want to do one more year of renting something and then I want to try and buy in 2006.
10672987	10676789	That's going to take establishing more credit and things like that and being a good boy and things like that.
10677449	10679530	And we'll see what happens with that.
10679731	10681592	And then, of course, there's relationship goals, too.
10681632	10687154	But at the same time, I don't think you can really set those kind of goals because then you'll have these expectations that may not be met.
10687174	10688695	You're just setting yourself up for disappointment.
10689316	10692277	So while the wish is there, it's not really a goal.
10692637	10693097	What can you say?
10693798	10694098	All right.
10696483	10702747	Moving on, MPQ wants to know, why did it take my Poppin' Music 5 soundtrack so long to arrive?
10704127	10710271	Well, I imagine the mix is several, or it's a couple years old now, so it's probably just hard to find.
10710831	10711751	It's the holidays.
10712872	10713252	That too?
10713312	10714113	Makes sense to me.
10714233	10715053	There, there you go.
10715513	10716294	That'll take a while.
10716314	10718315	Bad weather, holding up packages.
10718515	10718995	Exactly.
10719375	10720316	Tsunamis.
10720776	10722397	Everybody knows it's Al-Qaeda.
10723318	10724738	Loki's ranting about Al-Qaeda?
10724758	10725759	All right.
10730509	10735270	DJ Ranma S wants to know, did you all get everything that you wanted for Christmas?
10738950	10744111	No, I did not, and I don't care because I can work on it this year if I really want to.
10746992	10747292	Anybody else?
10748392	10751373	There were a couple of things I wanted, but I for the most part got what I wanted.
10753385	10755407	Me personally, I didn't really have a list of demands.
10755587	10757949	I just said I wanted to hang out with people more, and I did.
10757989	10761953	I went to some pretty cool parties in December, so, you know, it's all good.
10762053	10767457	I don't really have... The one material thing I wanted, I went out and I bought myself.
10767798	10769139	I got it, so, the end.
10769780	10772062	My raw plutonium's still in the mail, they tell me.
10775204	10776686	You didn't get your portal to hell, did you?
10777366	10778387	I haven't started it yet.
10778647	10779388	I haven't really leaked
10779980	10782460	Final Fantasy has kept me away from contacting the dead.
10782500	10783021	I'm sorry.
10784921	10785661	Actually, it's funny.
10785801	10800024	I was watching something on TV where I don't remember the show it was because I just happened to pass it while Dan was watching where they were talking about your experiment as going to be something that they were doing a news report on.
10802844	10803504	Yeah, that was it.
10803544	10806265	It was a movie and they were talking about the movie.
10807423	10808043	That was it.
10808324	10811365	And I was like, oh, that's Loki's portal to hell.
10815207	10816348	I just want to be like you.
10816588	10817468	You cool guy, you.
10818229	10821731	Alright, I gotta wrap this up, so I'm sorry because I'm cutting a few people's questions off.
10821771	10822571	I'm really sorry to you guys.
10822591	10823872	We're going to have to make this the last question.
10824392	10827594	Vidpower wants to know, I recently picked up Tycho Drummaster.
10827934	10829294	What do you guys think of this game?
10829495	10830075	Any advice?
10830095	10830735	Real quick.
10830755	10831716	It makes my hands hurt.
10832956	10833917	Freaking badass.
10834017	10834517	I love the game.
10835258	10835758	I love it too.
10837512	10839793	I still can't get over Katamari on the Rock, so you know what?
10840073	10840634	Deal with it!
10844716	10853101	I have yet to check out the US version, but my advice to you would be, if you like the US version, there's about five of them in Japan that are just waiting for you to pick them up.
10853421	10854161	Take breaks.
10855282	10856843	Otherwise you're going to kill your forearms.
10858112	10862114	I had a friend, my friend that got Donkey Konga complained of the same thing from playing it too much.
10862134	10869738	And even though it's a little bit different style still, I mean, as with any game that requires you to move motion, even DDR, take breaks.
10869878	10870978	You know, take breaks once in a while.
10871358	10873979	That's why you get a break stage on workout mode and things like that.
10875660	10876200	Any other advice?
10877361	10877581	Okay.
10878121	10880342	Well, that's going to bring that segment to a close.
10880362	10882343	Thank you guys for the good questions tonight.
10882383	10883103	We appreciate that.
10883624	10883744	And...
10885612	10886612	DarkSakura, PumpUpTheVolume
10913049	10924837	and also this Tuesday I will be playing the repeat yes, the one chance to catch the repeat on Orange Lounge Radio you'll catch that this Tuesday your one and only shot but DDR Freak Radio
10925723	10926403	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10953650	10956211	Alright, and what else?
10957871	10959832	You'll actually see a lot of faces two years ago.
10959852	10962793	I mean, you're one of the few people that was here two years ago that's still here.
10962833	10965374	A lot of folks that were here two years ago aren't here anymore, which is kind of sad.
10966054	10967034	Except Loki, he's still here.
10967714	10968915	He smooched his way onto the show.
10969935	10972596	And see, when I was on the show, he was sitting on the floor.
10972716	10973816	Now he's sitting on the floor!
10975517	10976097	Alright, alright.
10976377	10977337	Because it's his apartment now.
10978358	10978618	Anyway...
10979853	10984475	Anyway, also Thursday night, Outside the Box has been hitting some road bumps lately.
10984515	10985175	I'm sorry, you guys.
10985236	10987617	It's just that Rice Princess and Lanky Stahl have had other commitments.
10988417	10990618	So we're going to try and maybe play with that a little bit.
10990678	10992559	Hopefully we can bring Outside the Box back this week.
10992779	10995880	If not, we might kind of change the format a little bit and try something else.
10997121	10998882	Keep your eyes on OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
11000097	11002459	Something exciting is coming very soon.
11002879	11003439	Very soon.
11003699	11004700	That's all I can say right now.
11005120	11011144	Friday nights, DDR Freak Radio, working together with us to bring you the Orange Launch Radio Rewind, 6 o'clock.
11011184	11017408	If you missed this show, any part of it, or a previous week's show, tune in over at The Freak, 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.
11018248	11021910	I think that's about all the whoring I needed to do tonight for all the various stuff we're involved with.
11021950	11022170	Yes?
11023431	11024932	Anything else?
11025733	11027233	Any of our guests have anything they want to plug?
11028514	11028694	No?
11028894	11029495	Think we hit it all?
11029515	11029735	Cool.
11030447	11031869	Alright, Gwana Girl?
11032890	11036314	When you're not listening to Orange Lounge, go listen to DDR Freak Radio, that is all.
11037215	11037395	Yes.
11038416	11038796	You know what?
11039097	11040859	Honestly, just support internet radio in general.
11042236	11071003	just turn off your regular corporate commercially fed and I know a lot of people bitch that Life 365 plays too many commercials but you know what guys it is nothing compared to corporate radio turn on your FCC regulated censored airwaves sometime and take a listen to the crap they have on there and then tell me Life 365 sucks I have some great news for everybody too also G4 Tech TV or G4 TV the two girls on G4TechTV.com promised that they wouldn't suck this year
11072361	11077304	I know everybody's so enthusiastic because the channel's not going to suck anymore because they said so.
11077564	11079245	But what if you're one of their boyfriends?
11079605	11082167	But they also promised to do some lesbian action on there.
11083287	11084108	That was their promise.
11086249	11089031	Well, I will one-up that.
11089111	11094554	This year we will continue to not suck and we will bring you a hot lesbian action at some point during the year.
11095454	11097456	That gives us 360 days to work with here.
11099557	11101478	At some point we will bring you hot lesbian action.
11102003	11106104	and maybe some hot gay action too for you folks that are into that.
11108285	11111846	We'll not only give you one instance of lesbian action, we'll give you two!
11112646	11113307	How's that?
11113667	11115807	How do you like them apples, G4TV?
11116047	11116268	Huh?
11116408	11116648	Huh?
11118228	11118588	Alright.
11119008	11121649	Anyway, also the email boxes are open.
11121669	11122249	We have email.
11122269	11125811	If you ever want to say hi to us in email, you have a suggestion, comment, send us email.
11125871	11129932	It's rob at orangelongerator.com or jamie at orangelongerator.com
11130829	11132890	or loki.com.
11133510	11147333	Now folks, I know that you guys like to tell me that my penis is small and that my breasts need enlarging, but I'd like some actual male too, other than these other things.
11148133	11154075	I don't have any problem with my sexual performance, so I don't need any of those pills either, but thanks for the offers anyways.
11154861	11155521	All right, we got to go.
11155561	11156022	I'm sorry, guys.
11156042	11156502	We're running over.
11156562	11157163	Final thoughts.
11157843	11158323	Let's hear it.
11158623	11160144	We'll start with Islander since he has a mic.
11160325	11160865	Final thoughts.
11162166	11162366	I know.
11162386	11162986	It's all you, buddy.
11164127	11164988	None at the time.
11165268	11166308	I can't think of one.
11167049	11167349	Hmm.
11167529	11167929	Come back to me.
11169030	11169490	I want a girl.
11169691	11170091	Final thought.
11170411	11171392	My side hurts.
11171992	11172372	Feel better.
11172993	11173453	Take drugs.
11174354	11174674	Jazz.
11175634	11177155	I do not understand.
11179477	11179757	Angel.
11181038	11182559	The addiction helped not.
11185379	11185719	Islander.
11186179	11186500	Girls.
11189161	11189501	Jamie.
11191202	11192302	Go out and play a real game.
11193623	11194043	No!
11194644	11195004	Loki.
11195804	11201467	Playing 10 minute long marathon courses in Stepmania may hinder your ability for masturbation.
11204148	11208710	My final thought is I still got to work in my 20 minutes of DDR today so let's call it a wrap, shall we?
11209131	11210251	Final word of the show.
11210451	11212532	One word to sum up the whole damn show.
11212952	11213893	In one word...
11215168	11216169	Jazz, don't let me down.
11217990	11218410	Girls.
11219671	11224534	That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

11389197	11397123	Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
11429586	11433630	Alright guys, this is the part of the show called the Afterbirth.
11433810	11442579	Now what I have to kind of put out there is that our Afterbirth segments are going to be changing a little bit in the future because of something else that we're doing and I can't...
11442998	11446401	Spill the beans just yet, but trust me, you'll be cool with this once you find out.
11446441	11448022	So our afterbursts are going to be a little bit shorter.
11448623	11456830	And just so you guys know, when our shows are over, you're going to be going back straight to the Orange Lounge Radio Bomani Music and More program.
11456870	11458171	That does mean you get dumped from the stream.
11458191	11459913	You're going to have to reconnect in 30 seconds.
11460313	11461554	But it's no big deal, right?
11461614	11464577	You guys still love Orange Lounge and will listen to it, right?
11464997	11466178	No, they hate us.
11466238	11466999	I know, they hate us.
11468340	11469421	I thought that was a good show tonight.
11469461	11470141	It was a very good show.
11470942	11480188	I love it when Iguana Girl and Jazz comes in from out of town and Islander's here and Angel's here, of course, and Loki has food so he's happy.
11480748	11482769	Loki, you look pretty pissed off at the beginning of the show.
11483230	11486372	I think you tripped on something and I saw you just go into anger mode.
11486392	11486812	What happened?
11487679	11489560	I tripped on two sets of cords.
11489660	11493022	First, set number one going from the cabinet to the chair.
11493443	11499346	And set number two going from the table next to the cabinet to somewhere towards the wall.
11499366	11501087	It's like two trip wires that we have in here.
11501367	11502128	And I hit them both.
11502968	11504749	And that and I had a fucking headache.
11504809	11507051	And it seems to be going away now that I have food.
11507171	11511233	I think it's probably because I didn't eat since 11.
11511654	11515616	And when I did eat at 11, it was four day old twists.
11516471	11516851	Ew!
11517812	11521735	Literally, my jaw was sore from chewing those twists.
11521796	11527080	It's like, you know, if you work out, you know, while you can't move your arm, well, that was like my jaw.
11527220	11527780	It sucked.
11528241	11533245	But, so I made my fried rice thing, and I have enough now for the whole week, so I'm gonna eat it.
11534816	11536177	I'd like to comment in the chat room.
11536197	11539399	There's still a few people in there over at www.orange.com and chat.
11539959	11542240	Dark Knight says, dang, the studio cleared out fast, didn't it?
11542280	11548483	Well, yeah, this is very typical where most of our guests take off during the closing credits there, just like a lot of our listeners do.
11548844	11551965	Well, we understand it's kind of late for you guys out there, especially on the East Coast.
11552005	11554567	It's, what, 12.30 your time out there, so pretty late.
11555627	11560410	But, you know, obviously, Iguana Girl is kind of hurting there a little bit, and Jazz...
11561178	11589883	Jazz had to drive back to the bay tonight so it's very typical where people have just got to get somewhere else so it's kind of interesting with radio though sometimes you can't always tell people will run into the studio sometimes while the opening is playing and be in their seat right in time for the show to start and you know live TV and other live radio programs work this exact same way so it's just kind of funny the illusion that it sometimes gives that we've been sitting here for a half hour waiting for the show to start no I don't think so
11591656	11592116	We love you!
11592136	11592436	We love you!
11618666	11620068	Thank you for watching!
