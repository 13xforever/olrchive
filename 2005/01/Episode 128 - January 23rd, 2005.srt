[SPEAKER_19]: I know a whole bunch of crap about him that I'm not at liberty to speak of.

151
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:13,579
[SPEAKER_19]: But it involves legal action.

152
00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:14,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Make up your own story.

153
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:17,062
[SPEAKER_09]: That could be a contest, maybe.

154
00:18:17,102 --> 00:18:17,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Write your fanfic.

155
00:18:17,923 --> 00:18:18,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, maybe not.

156
00:18:19,024 --> 00:18:21,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

157
00:18:22,488 --> 00:18:32,018
[SPEAKER_07]: He was abducted by aliens and went up with Richard Dreyfuss, and then they flew away while Steven Spielberg got rich.

158
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,420
[SPEAKER_44]: Yes, that's it.

159
00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:40,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, usually we start off the show playing a little bit of how was your week, how was your day, and we're going to get into that in a little bit.

160
00:18:40,462 --> 00:18:43,924
[SPEAKER_09]: However, I did want to kind of make an exception tonight for this.

161
00:18:45,164 --> 00:18:49,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie and I were talking about this a little bit before tonight's show and we thought we wanted to take a minute to acknowledge this.

162
00:18:50,285 --> 00:19:16,662
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have had the television on at all today, I'm sure you've heard about this, so we're probably not the first ones to break this news to you, but Johnny Carson, you know, the late night guy that was on for many, many, many years, he passed away today, and we just wanted to take a minute to kind of offer up a moment of silence, because I don't know about you guys, but for me, I think Johnny Carson is an inspiration to any sort of talk program ever.

163
00:19:16,762 --> 00:19:18,603
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the guy was absolutely hilarious.

164
00:19:18,663 --> 00:19:19,604
[SPEAKER_09]: He was a comic genius.

165
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:26,173
[SPEAKER_09]: So many people on his show, so many careers of celebrities that we know today got started all thanks to his help.

166
00:19:26,673 --> 00:19:31,036
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just want to take a minute to acknowledge Mr. Johnny Carson.

167
00:19:31,577 --> 00:19:32,537
[SPEAKER_09]: A moment of silence, please.

168
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:38,061
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, thank you very much.

169
00:19:39,222 --> 00:19:40,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything you want to add to that, Jamie?

170
00:19:41,323 --> 00:19:43,285
[SPEAKER_19]: I remember that weird curtain he had.

171
00:19:44,445 --> 00:19:47,888
[SPEAKER_19]: I remember the curtain reappearing in Mallrats.

172
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:49,909
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember Ed McMahon.

173
00:19:51,459 --> 00:19:52,520
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

174
00:20:24,904 --> 00:20:27,765
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very little bit cold outside, isn't it?

175
00:20:29,266 --> 00:20:31,887
[SPEAKER_19]: Excuse me for a second.

176
00:20:31,927 --> 00:20:37,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Just so you guys know what's going on, we're just... Oh, say hello, Mr. Man, who just picked up the microphone, who's getting glomped right now.

177
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:42,852
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, yeah, it's... Yeah, that guy called Floatwalk, and he's got something to say later.

178
00:20:43,592 --> 00:20:44,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay, all right.

179
00:20:45,513 --> 00:20:45,673
[SPEAKER_09]: And?

180
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,014
[SPEAKER_16]: And his faithful traveling companion, Sharkskrull.

181
00:20:48,074 --> 00:20:49,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, Sharkskrull.

182
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:50,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, how are you?

183
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:50,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello!

184
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:52,540
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello, I have presents for you.

185
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,142
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for making me feel special.

186
00:20:54,162 --> 00:21:00,067
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta let DarkSakura finish her thought that she was starting with.

187
00:21:14,426 --> 00:21:19,791
[SPEAKER_19]: My week was, well, it started off really good because I started my new position at work on Tuesday.

188
00:21:20,431 --> 00:21:24,434
[SPEAKER_19]: Making more money, doing cooler stuff, and not talking to people on the phone.

189
00:21:25,816 --> 00:21:32,061
[SPEAKER_19]: And then as of Wednesday, I was single for about most of the day.

190
00:21:33,522 --> 00:21:35,283
[SPEAKER_19]: As Lynn literally dumped that day.

191
00:21:36,825 --> 00:21:37,025
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

192
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:37,125
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

193
00:21:38,292 --> 00:21:40,013
[SPEAKER_19]: and things have since been repaired.

194
00:21:41,754 --> 00:21:50,558
[SPEAKER_19]: Although it's been a very, very, I'm not, of course, it's nobody's real business what happened, but I've been very much on edge for this entire week.

195
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:55,100
[SPEAKER_19]: And today has been the first good day of my entire week.

196
00:22:00,243 --> 00:22:00,543
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just,

197
00:22:04,794 --> 00:22:05,754
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not really going to go into it.

198
00:22:05,794 --> 00:22:06,975
[SPEAKER_19]: It was really, really hard.

199
00:22:08,335 --> 00:22:08,795
[SPEAKER_09]: It's personal.

200
00:22:08,835 --> 00:22:09,195
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fine.

201
00:22:09,835 --> 00:22:17,177
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, but that's really been the entire focus of my week, although I've played a whole crapload of Castlevania today.

202
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:19,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Which one?

203
00:22:19,818 --> 00:22:20,498
[SPEAKER_19]: Symphony of the Night.

204
00:22:20,818 --> 00:22:21,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Right on.

205
00:22:22,778 --> 00:22:29,640
[SPEAKER_19]: And I had two class orientations, spent $118 on art supplies, and I still need to buy another 60 more.

206
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeez.

207
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,461
[SPEAKER_19]: What kind of class is this for?

208
00:22:33,321 --> 00:22:33,381
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh,

209
00:22:33,999 --> 00:22:35,020
[SPEAKER_19]: Concept of art design.

210
00:22:37,763 --> 00:22:41,487
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I have to buy paint next, like watercolors and crap.

211
00:22:43,088 --> 00:22:47,232
[SPEAKER_19]: So, that's really it for this week.

212
00:22:48,073 --> 00:22:49,214
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's why I'm full of angst.

213
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:50,616
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, well.

214
00:22:50,656 --> 00:22:54,820
[SPEAKER_19]: However, I have rediscovered the joys of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches made with pineapple jelly.

215
00:22:55,706 --> 00:22:56,727
[SPEAKER_09]: I figured you'd like the picture.

216
00:23:19,781 --> 00:23:20,762
[SPEAKER_09]: I rejoined that too.

217
00:23:44,884 --> 00:23:46,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh.

218
00:23:46,445 --> 00:23:46,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Addict!

219
00:23:47,105 --> 00:23:47,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Addict!

220
00:23:48,045 --> 00:23:48,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you're not an addict.

221
00:23:48,986 --> 00:23:49,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, sure.

222
00:23:49,606 --> 00:23:50,846
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll cover that later.

223
00:23:51,246 --> 00:23:52,127
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm not an addict.

224
00:23:52,907 --> 00:24:03,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, then I was working on the Orange Box at the moment, and for those who don't know what the Orange Box is, that's the Xbox case that's going to have a PC in it.

225
00:24:04,271 --> 00:24:11,514
[SPEAKER_07]: And I spent lots of time dremeling today, and now the case is, you know, kind of a,

226
00:24:12,814 --> 00:24:15,135
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

227
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,520
[SPEAKER_07]: That will be replacing it.

228
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:46,602
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know why I need a 160 gig hard drive considering that this... I don't really know what the hell I'm going to put on it.

229
00:24:46,722 --> 00:24:47,122
[SPEAKER_07]: ROMs.

230
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:49,622
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't think I can fit 160 gigs of ROMs.

231
00:24:49,662 --> 00:24:50,542
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a lot.

232
00:24:52,743 --> 00:24:54,723
[SPEAKER_07]: And then... What else?

233
00:24:54,863 --> 00:24:54,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh!

234
00:24:55,683 --> 00:24:58,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than that, I had a migraine yesterday and that was lots of fun.

235
00:24:59,144 --> 00:25:04,165
[SPEAKER_07]: And then... No, that's pretty much it.

236
00:25:06,185 --> 00:25:06,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

237
00:25:08,826 --> 00:25:13,288
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I did not plan how to rape Robin in the sleep, but there was a sketch... What?

238
00:25:14,568 --> 00:25:14,828
[SPEAKER_26]: What?

239
00:25:15,128 --> 00:25:18,450
[SPEAKER_07]: But Nellie said she would try for $100, but she... $50.

240
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:32,235
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to ask, because I was sitting here the other night, we were all sitting around, and Nellie, who is Loki's other half, was just coming up with all these random hypothetical questions, and they all had to do with raping me.

241
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:38,080
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, we're going to get that kid named Jagermeister eventually.

242
00:25:40,901 --> 00:25:42,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you rape him in a boat?

243
00:25:42,242 --> 00:25:43,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you rape him on a float?

244
00:25:43,683 --> 00:25:45,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you rape him near or far?

245
00:25:45,183 --> 00:25:46,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you rape him in a car?

246
00:25:47,444 --> 00:25:51,886
[SPEAKER_20]: But it would be really easy to rape you in your sleep because you sleep a lot on the couch on your back.

247
00:25:52,687 --> 00:26:00,530
[SPEAKER_20]: And since 70% of male sleep is spent with an erection, I was thinking I'd just sneak up on him and pull his pants down.

248
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:04,192
[SPEAKER_20]: And insertion equals rape, so that's like an easy 50 bucks.

249
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:08,378
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but the minute you sit on me, I'm going to go, Ah!

250
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,220
[SPEAKER_20]: It's in already, so it doesn't matter.

251
00:26:12,081 --> 00:26:12,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my God.

252
00:26:14,143 --> 00:26:15,284
[SPEAKER_09]: You're a sick woman.

253
00:26:15,304 --> 00:26:20,548
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to steal my... This is the first time we've gotten Nellie to really talk on this show, and it's about raping me.

254
00:26:23,551 --> 00:26:24,651
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what I do best.

255
00:26:25,232 --> 00:26:29,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Then she's sitting around trying to get Loki, Would you rape Rob for a million dollars?

256
00:26:31,017 --> 00:26:33,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you rape Rob for a hundred thousand dollars?

257
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:36,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you rape him for 20 bucks?

258
00:26:37,052 --> 00:26:37,552
[SPEAKER_09]: And a smile.

259
00:26:37,572 --> 00:26:39,494
[SPEAKER_09]: I love her.

260
00:26:39,554 --> 00:26:41,156
[SPEAKER_19]: Would you rape Rob for a Klondike bar?

261
00:26:43,899 --> 00:26:45,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, Klondike bar.

262
00:26:46,201 --> 00:26:49,264
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Klondike bars, but no, no, no.

263
00:26:53,909 --> 00:26:56,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Now the chat room is having their own rhyming contest here.

264
00:26:56,811 --> 00:26:58,413
[SPEAKER_09]: OrangeLawnsRadio.com, click on chat.

265
00:26:58,713 --> 00:26:59,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Now blaze.

266
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:02,731
[SPEAKER_09]: about me for a question for Loki here.

267
00:27:02,971 --> 00:27:04,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you rape him in the face?

268
00:27:04,591 --> 00:27:05,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you rape him anyplace?

269
00:27:10,313 --> 00:27:12,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Somewhere, Dr. Seuss is crying.

270
00:27:12,834 --> 00:27:14,435
[SPEAKER_20]: But I offered to split the money with you.

271
00:27:15,655 --> 00:27:16,015
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, gee.

272
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:19,476
[SPEAKER_20]: That's why it's $100, because I was going to give $50 to you.

273
00:27:19,516 --> 00:27:19,716
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

274
00:27:20,857 --> 00:27:21,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Never mind.

275
00:27:21,297 --> 00:27:23,817
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to get technical and ask, technically, what is rape?

276
00:27:23,837 --> 00:27:24,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Does oral sex count as rape?

277
00:27:25,098 --> 00:27:25,258
No.

278
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:26,298
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

279
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:28,899
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, move on.

280
00:27:29,511 --> 00:27:32,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on to non-raping subjects, at least I hope.

281
00:27:32,894 --> 00:27:33,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Mel B, how was your week?

282
00:27:33,915 --> 00:27:34,495
[SPEAKER_09]: How was your day?

283
00:27:35,536 --> 00:27:36,257
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, dear.

284
00:27:36,957 --> 00:27:41,421
[SPEAKER_35]: Week was a lot of monotony, but then again, when you're working in video games, you wait.

285
00:27:41,461 --> 00:27:42,742
[SPEAKER_35]: That's really how it goes.

286
00:27:43,383 --> 00:27:46,906
[SPEAKER_35]: For those who may or may not know, I actually did not work at Konami at the time.

287
00:27:50,229 --> 00:27:51,450
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay, just reading these lines.

288
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:51,830
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

289
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Chat room, stop being funny.

290
00:27:54,132 --> 00:27:54,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop.

291
00:27:55,694 --> 00:27:57,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop being... Okay, I'll say it.

292
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:02,672
[SPEAKER_09]: For those that are not into chat, Blaze, the comic genius of Blaze again.

293
00:28:02,992 --> 00:28:04,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you rape him in the ear?

294
00:28:04,552 --> 00:28:05,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you rape him for a beer?

295
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:10,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you rape him like a duck?

296
00:28:11,015 --> 00:28:12,095
[SPEAKER_09]: Would anyone give a fuck?

297
00:28:12,955 --> 00:28:14,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you rape him for five bucks?

298
00:28:14,556 --> 00:28:15,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you rape him like a duck?

299
00:28:16,116 --> 00:28:17,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, jeez, forget it.

300
00:28:17,317 --> 00:28:18,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Chat room, stop being funny.

301
00:28:18,637 --> 00:28:18,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop.

302
00:28:19,718 --> 00:28:20,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop.

303
00:28:21,698 --> 00:28:22,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, Mel.

304
00:28:22,579 --> 00:28:26,620
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah, I'm actually, instead of being at Konami right now, I'm actually working at Namco.

305
00:28:27,276 --> 00:28:34,899
[SPEAKER_35]: of all places, which means it's a lot of Pac-Man and Pac-Man and Tekken 5.

306
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:38,180
[SPEAKER_35]: But it's just kind of going along.

307
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:38,620
[SPEAKER_35]: It's a job.

308
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,681
[SPEAKER_35]: Everything is kind of interesting.

309
00:28:41,021 --> 00:28:47,944
[SPEAKER_35]: And of course, as with any place I go to, there's that one person who watches me play either DDO or 2DX at work.

310
00:28:48,004 --> 00:28:50,965
[SPEAKER_35]: I usually bring my stuff on break and play user debug stations.

311
00:28:51,065 --> 00:28:51,145
[SPEAKER_35]: And

312
00:28:52,043 --> 00:28:54,284
[SPEAKER_35]: They say, wow, did you work at Konami or test this game?

313
00:28:54,324 --> 00:28:57,225
[SPEAKER_35]: Like, I didn't test this game, but, you know, I played before and stuff.

314
00:28:57,465 --> 00:28:58,846
[SPEAKER_35]: Like, wow, you must feel like DDR, too.

315
00:28:58,866 --> 00:29:00,907
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm like, yeah, I played, you know, I played DDR for a couple years.

316
00:29:00,927 --> 00:29:03,888
[SPEAKER_35]: And he goes, wait a minute, weren't you at that first Metreon tournament?

317
00:29:03,928 --> 00:29:04,749
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm like, yeah.

318
00:29:04,969 --> 00:29:06,009
[SPEAKER_35]: Wait a minute, what's your name again?

319
00:29:06,489 --> 00:29:06,970
[SPEAKER_35]: Uh, Mel.

320
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:10,151
[SPEAKER_35]: They're like, no way, you're not Mel B. I'm like, yeah.

321
00:29:10,471 --> 00:29:11,812
[SPEAKER_35]: Like, dude, let me see your name badge.

322
00:29:11,992 --> 00:29:14,113
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm like, this is at work?

323
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:15,273
[SPEAKER_35]: This is at work.

324
00:29:16,114 --> 00:29:21,496
[SPEAKER_35]: Here, guys, like, other testers come up to me and, like, know me through this stuff and... Don't you...

325
00:29:22,176 --> 00:29:24,538
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have time to be fraternizing on your breaks.

326
00:29:24,678 --> 00:29:28,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't there a new Katamari Damacy game to be testing and Tekken 5 and all that stuff?

327
00:29:29,002 --> 00:29:30,443
[SPEAKER_35]: That'll be later this year.

328
00:29:31,784 --> 00:29:32,364
[SPEAKER_35]: How it goes.

329
00:29:32,845 --> 00:29:36,047
[SPEAKER_35]: But yeah, we have all sorts of goodies over there right now.

330
00:29:36,087 --> 00:29:38,269
[SPEAKER_35]: We get to see a lot of PSP action out there, actually.

331
00:29:38,429 --> 00:29:39,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, very hot.

332
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:41,992
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah, so those things look pretty sexy, I must say.

333
00:29:42,092 --> 00:29:43,613
[SPEAKER_35]: They look a lot better than what I remember at E3.

334
00:29:43,633 --> 00:29:44,894
[SPEAKER_35]: I remember that much.

335
00:29:45,835 --> 00:29:47,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Is Namco going to be putting anything out on the DS?

336
00:29:48,677 --> 00:29:50,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Because damn, the DS needs some games.

337
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:51,620
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes, there is.

338
00:29:52,298 --> 00:29:53,519
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, the Pac-Pix thing.

339
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:54,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course.

340
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:57,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Namco has to whore Pac-Man wherever they can.

341
00:29:57,781 --> 00:29:58,101
[SPEAKER_35]: Mm-hmm.

342
00:29:58,501 --> 00:30:12,107
[SPEAKER_35]: I mean, yeah, basically, the two main sounds you hear out of Namco are waka-waka and... Seriously, that's just what I feel like when I walk around the whole... When you walk around the Namco building, do you actually do a... Do they have dots on the floor?

343
00:30:18,447 --> 00:30:25,793
[SPEAKER_35]: I think in one of the old rooms, because they just moved buildings, but at the old building, yes, there was a room that actually had, like, a Pac-Man mic.

344
00:30:26,154 --> 00:30:29,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, at Namco, can you have drag days, and you just all come to work with a bow in your hair?

345
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:37,904
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, man, they just instituted a dress code out there, so we can't even, like, you know, come in our normal does.

346
00:30:37,924 --> 00:30:40,806
[SPEAKER_35]: We gotta have, like, collared shirts, and we gotta be all prim and proper.

347
00:30:41,567 --> 00:30:45,190
[SPEAKER_09]: I would, so, if I worked at Namco, thank God I don't, because they couldn't handle me.

348
00:30:45,558 --> 00:30:50,321
[SPEAKER_09]: But if I were Dinamco, man, I'd come to work with a bow in my hair one day and be all, yes, I miss Roberts.

349
00:30:54,304 --> 00:30:55,004
[SPEAKER_35]: Forget it.

350
00:30:55,385 --> 00:30:57,386
[SPEAKER_35]: So, yeah, just getting used to the new gig.

351
00:30:57,486 --> 00:30:58,467
[SPEAKER_35]: It's, you know, pretty cool.

352
00:30:58,807 --> 00:31:03,830
[SPEAKER_35]: Although, you know, after playing a fighting game for eight hours straight, it can be tiresome.

353
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:09,194
[SPEAKER_35]: Or, you know, when they do something genius like have me play a two-player mode all by myself for eight hours.

354
00:31:09,314 --> 00:31:11,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I was reading about that in the LJ.

355
00:31:11,175 --> 00:31:11,856
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up with that?

356
00:31:11,876 --> 00:31:13,617
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't know, man.

357
00:31:13,717 --> 00:31:14,978
[SPEAKER_35]: They're just geniuses out there.

358
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:15,418
[SPEAKER_35]: What can I say?

359
00:31:15,945 --> 00:31:23,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I've played two-player versus in fighting games by myself before, but that was, like, to see all the fatalities in Mortal Kombat, okay?

360
00:31:23,847 --> 00:31:24,067
[SPEAKER_35]: Right.

361
00:31:24,187 --> 00:31:27,227
[SPEAKER_35]: I mean, if I want to do something like that, just put me on practice mode.

362
00:31:27,267 --> 00:31:30,488
[SPEAKER_35]: At least there's some kind of, you know, indicator of what you're doing in there.

363
00:31:30,508 --> 00:31:35,689
[SPEAKER_35]: You can actually, like, practice stuff in practice mode, but if you play versus, it's kind of pointless.

364
00:31:36,869 --> 00:31:38,430
[SPEAKER_35]: But, yeah, for that.

365
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:40,550
[SPEAKER_35]: And then the weekend's been pretty, you know, chill.

366
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:44,331
[SPEAKER_35]: I mean, yesterday was a pretty horrible day because I was going to go to work,

367
00:31:45,323 --> 00:31:47,124
[SPEAKER_35]: I wake up and I realize I can't find my car keys.

368
00:31:47,164 --> 00:31:49,005
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm like, hmm, what could be going on?

369
00:31:49,565 --> 00:31:50,986
[SPEAKER_35]: And so I'm just kind of worried.

370
00:31:51,006 --> 00:31:53,167
[SPEAKER_35]: So I start turning my place upside down and I don't find it.

371
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:56,188
[SPEAKER_35]: And I couldn't find my phone because it was locked in my car.

372
00:31:56,688 --> 00:32:01,610
[SPEAKER_35]: And so, you know, my phone was in my car and I didn't have my car keys.

373
00:32:02,031 --> 00:32:03,411
[SPEAKER_35]: And so I'm just like really tripping.

374
00:32:03,511 --> 00:32:07,433
[SPEAKER_35]: And then, so I don't know how to, you know, contact anyone or anything.

375
00:32:07,553 --> 00:32:11,675
[SPEAKER_35]: And it's like, first I didn't want to, you know, tell anyone.

376
00:32:12,536 --> 00:32:16,118
[SPEAKER_35]: Sharks girl over here because she knows I'm like the most forgetful person in the world.

377
00:32:16,438 --> 00:32:20,159
[SPEAKER_35]: Last thing I needed was more, you know, fuel for her fire and etc.

378
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:25,742
[SPEAKER_35]: And then it kind of got to the point where I just kind of said, okay, screw it.

379
00:32:25,762 --> 00:32:29,083
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm just going to call mobile locksmith and yeah, I'm just going to bite the bullet, etc.

380
00:32:29,563 --> 00:32:31,284
[SPEAKER_35]: And so what happens is I called a locksmith and

381
00:32:32,094 --> 00:32:59,405
[SPEAKER_35]: he comes on over and he pops my door open and it was going to cost about like damn near 300 bucks to get a new key because I have like a computer chip in my key that's you know certain to the Camaro series of that year and right when he pops my door open my cell phone goes off and it starts going and she calls me and says hey I just found your keys right now in my handbag I'm like no way so it was all about impeccable timing that night but I was on edge pretty much that rest of the day and

382
00:33:00,239 --> 00:33:06,043
[SPEAKER_35]: Everything else has been pretty chill and today's been just coming up here and of course Orange Lounge is where I be.

383
00:33:07,564 --> 00:33:09,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, and Pixie?

384
00:33:13,547 --> 00:33:22,953
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, to say the least, I spent the majority of my week on vacation in Hayward doing butt-ass nothing, driving a truck all day long.

385
00:33:24,134 --> 00:33:29,177
[SPEAKER_13]: And, let's see, came back on Thursday night in like dense-ass fog.

386
00:33:30,697 --> 00:33:31,157
[SPEAKER_13]: What else do we do?

387
00:33:31,658 --> 00:33:32,378
[SPEAKER_13]: What else do we do?

388
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,461
[SPEAKER_13]: Stop bringing goddamn books!

389
00:33:36,502 --> 00:33:36,902
[SPEAKER_13]: Bitch!

390
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:40,024
[SPEAKER_13]: Now he won't talk to me.

391
00:33:40,044 --> 00:33:40,925
[SPEAKER_13]: But anyways, yeah.

392
00:33:41,025 --> 00:33:41,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that the new one?

393
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:43,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that the new one?

394
00:33:44,107 --> 00:33:46,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the one with the Chains of Prometheus stuff in it?

395
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:48,311
I'm sorry.

396
00:33:48,891 --> 00:33:49,552
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I had that one.

397
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:49,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Never mind.

398
00:33:50,172 --> 00:33:51,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, anyways, continue.

399
00:33:52,834 --> 00:33:54,295
[SPEAKER_19]: And, let's see, Saturday.

400
00:33:54,315 --> 00:33:57,358
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I've been boring.

401
00:33:57,378 --> 00:33:58,839
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't been here very often.

402
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:00,423
Alright Frank, give it to Victor.

403
00:34:07,248 --> 00:34:08,168
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm right here.

404
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:14,693
[SPEAKER_13]: Buy me a bottle of Jager and give me five bucks in five minutes.

405
00:34:17,235 --> 00:34:19,016
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, Rob, you can open your gift now.

406
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:21,418
[SPEAKER_13]: This was Angel's idea to get this.

407
00:34:21,758 --> 00:34:22,379
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes it was.

408
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:27,182
[SPEAKER_13]: So I could redeem myself because I flaked twice on you when I said I was going to come by.

409
00:34:27,763 --> 00:34:29,204
[SPEAKER_13]: But you have to read the card first.

410
00:34:31,926 --> 00:34:32,867
[SPEAKER_09]: I love GIFs.

411
00:34:33,007 --> 00:34:33,707
[SPEAKER_09]: This is great.

412
00:34:33,787 --> 00:34:36,488
[SPEAKER_09]: I think every week should be Bring Sky GIFs Week on Orange Lounge.

413
00:34:36,709 --> 00:34:38,870
[SPEAKER_18]: Next week will be Bring Sky GIFs Day.

414
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:42,191
[SPEAKER_19]: I was like, it wasn't my... Yeah, it was her idea.

415
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:43,072
[SPEAKER_19]: She spotted it.

416
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:43,872
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, fine.

417
00:34:43,892 --> 00:34:46,674
[SPEAKER_18]: Where's the card?

418
00:34:46,714 --> 00:34:47,514
[SPEAKER_13]: Where's the card?

419
00:34:47,934 --> 00:34:49,335
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, go through the double wrap.

420
00:34:50,356 --> 00:34:52,757
[SPEAKER_13]: The double ghetto wrap that I call Winko Plastic Bag.

421
00:34:52,777 --> 00:34:53,677
[SPEAKER_09]: I love present time.

422
00:34:54,758 --> 00:34:55,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Aw, it's kisses.

423
00:34:55,979 --> 00:34:57,239
[SPEAKER_09]: It has a little pig on it.

424
00:34:57,259 --> 00:34:58,360
[SPEAKER_09]: It says, kiss you.

425
00:35:00,572 --> 00:35:01,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Make me squeal.

426
00:35:01,753 --> 00:35:05,236
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it says inside, it says, Will you marry me?

427
00:35:07,057 --> 00:35:08,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Janae just proposed to me.

428
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:09,379
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

429
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:10,900
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, bitch, I'll marry you.

430
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,143
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, your ring's in the bag, too.

431
00:35:14,243 --> 00:35:16,144
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, your ring's in the bag.

432
00:35:16,164 --> 00:35:17,265
[SPEAKER_13]: Your ring's in the bag, too.

433
00:35:19,947 --> 00:35:20,748
[SPEAKER_26]: What the shit?

434
00:35:24,091 --> 00:35:24,231
[SPEAKER_10]: It's...

435
00:35:25,231 --> 00:35:27,454
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a rainbow dessert parfait.

436
00:35:27,975 --> 00:35:28,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Get it?

437
00:35:28,556 --> 00:35:29,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'm a big fag?

438
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,219
[SPEAKER_09]: It's rainbow?

439
00:35:34,564 --> 00:35:36,226
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll go put this on cam.

440
00:35:38,529 --> 00:35:39,871
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's shaped like a hole.

441
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:44,731
[SPEAKER_05]: A bag of mayonnaise.

442
00:35:46,532 --> 00:35:47,873
[SPEAKER_05]: What the fuck, lady?

443
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:51,415
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't mean it with a bag of mayonnaise.

444
00:35:51,435 --> 00:35:57,639
[SPEAKER_13]: That was for my sandwich.

445
00:35:57,739 --> 00:35:59,040
[SPEAKER_05]: I will remember this forever.

446
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:08,466
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go with my mom and say, Mama, I got proposed to with a bag of mayonnaise and a Froot Loop.

447
00:36:11,118 --> 00:36:13,799
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought $2 would be enough to spend on you, you know?

448
00:36:19,482 --> 00:36:22,043
[SPEAKER_19]: Other than Frozen and Rob, that's been my week.

449
00:36:23,384 --> 00:36:23,744
Victor?

450
00:36:24,965 --> 00:36:27,166
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, my week, or the week before, which was more exciting.

451
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:27,806
[SPEAKER_32]: Actually, just kidding.

452
00:36:27,846 --> 00:36:29,667
[SPEAKER_32]: This week was fun with my girlfriend.

453
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:30,828
[SPEAKER_32]: We had a lot of sex!

454
00:36:31,328 --> 00:36:32,749
[SPEAKER_32]: No, we had no sex.

455
00:36:32,769 --> 00:36:34,529
[SPEAKER_32]: What the hell is that tuna smell?

456
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,171
[SPEAKER_32]: Sorry, I had a sandwich in there.

457
00:36:38,691 --> 00:36:39,692
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, ugh.

458
00:36:41,035 --> 00:36:45,916
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, anyways, playing Final Fantasy Online and Rank 6.

459
00:36:47,617 --> 00:36:50,917
[SPEAKER_32]: Have a whole bunch of plus one gear and leaping lizards and all that crap.

460
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:56,739
[SPEAKER_32]: Other than that, this week with my girlfriend was exciting.

461
00:36:57,399 --> 00:36:57,879
[SPEAKER_32]: I loved it.

462
00:36:58,679 --> 00:36:59,099
[SPEAKER_32]: And that was it.

463
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:01,120
[SPEAKER_42]: Aww.

464
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:05,621
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, by the way, you can double the ring mold as something to put your dick in.

465
00:37:07,721 --> 00:37:08,422
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, my God.

466
00:37:12,725 --> 00:37:12,965
[SPEAKER_26]: You.

467
00:37:20,008 --> 00:37:21,108
[SPEAKER_07]: It's safe sex.

468
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:25,710
[SPEAKER_07]: That mayonnaise does not have a spermicide in it.

469
00:37:29,871 --> 00:37:31,032
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the new microphones.

470
00:37:31,512 --> 00:37:33,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I can't wait to go fuck my new rainbow pussy.

471
00:37:33,893 --> 00:37:34,793
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so excited.

472
00:37:38,515 --> 00:37:38,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Bitch.

473
00:37:41,773 --> 00:37:42,914
[SPEAKER_38]: I love you!

474
00:37:44,815 --> 00:37:48,458
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just too hardcore for G4 TV, that's why we'd never be on there.

475
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, anyways.

476
00:37:54,862 --> 00:37:58,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Our chat room is so lost right now because they're not getting half these references, but that's alright.

477
00:37:59,685 --> 00:38:01,566
[SPEAKER_09]: NoStylin, were you done talking about your week and your day?

478
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:04,208
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm rank 6.

479
00:38:04,428 --> 00:38:05,829
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you waving your hand in the air?

480
00:38:06,109 --> 00:38:07,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Waving it like you just don't care?

481
00:38:08,831 --> 00:38:11,393
[SPEAKER_07]: You might get those girls parapairing.

482
00:38:13,366 --> 00:38:14,726
[SPEAKER_09]: You got ranked 6th on Final Fantasy.

483
00:38:14,746 --> 00:38:16,407
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so proud of you.

484
00:38:16,447 --> 00:38:17,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Your internet penis is huge!

485
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:22,269
[SPEAKER_32]: I have 90 days playing Acquired.

486
00:38:22,349 --> 00:38:24,050
[SPEAKER_32]: I have wasted my life.

487
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:24,770
[SPEAKER_32]: Jamie?

488
00:38:26,511 --> 00:38:26,931
[SPEAKER_09]: If you would.

489
00:38:27,411 --> 00:38:27,691
[SPEAKER_19]: Addict?

490
00:38:30,832 --> 00:38:32,373
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what?

491
00:38:33,233 --> 00:38:37,195
[SPEAKER_19]: I plan on addicting myself because Ragnarok Online 2 is not yet out.

492
00:38:38,194 --> 00:38:42,655
[SPEAKER_19]: and I need something to play because I miss Ragnarok so much but I'm so pissed off at Gravity right now.

493
00:38:43,716 --> 00:38:49,858
[SPEAKER_19]: I actually spent a whole ten minutes on Final Fantasy XI yesterday waiting on Rob.

494
00:38:53,499 --> 00:38:53,819
[SPEAKER_44]: Alright.

495
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Shark Skrull.

496
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:02,761
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, I had to revel in the moment there about Jamie actually playing Final Fantasy XI.

497
00:39:02,801 --> 00:39:03,902
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to think about it for a minute.

498
00:39:05,422 --> 00:39:06,242
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, you're done now.

499
00:39:06,322 --> 00:39:06,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, Shark Skrull.

500
00:39:07,143 --> 00:39:07,583
[SPEAKER_09]: How was your week?

501
00:39:07,603 --> 00:39:07,983
[SPEAKER_09]: How was your day?

502
00:39:08,393 --> 00:39:09,053
[SPEAKER_16]: That'd be awesome.

503
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:44,781
[SPEAKER_07]: that would be kind of a different change I forgot to mention I had big news my job well

504
00:39:46,109 --> 00:40:11,746
[SPEAKER_07]: technically it's not been announced yet but since no one really listens to the station anyways of any importance I thought I would go ahead and mention it well our company has decided to get back into the games business so now they're going to be doing game distribution and I've been told by the CEO and by my boss that I'll be a part of it somehow but you have to rape them I do not have to rape them

505
00:40:16,801 --> 00:40:18,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Rape them at a medium pace.

506
00:40:19,923 --> 00:40:21,344
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to rape them at the mall.

507
00:40:21,404 --> 00:40:22,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Then you have to rape them all.

508
00:40:23,506 --> 00:40:23,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

509
00:40:23,806 --> 00:40:26,748
[SPEAKER_19]: Why do you rape them for a PSP?

510
00:40:26,808 --> 00:40:32,552
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like this slogan they used to have for the mall back in Mobile.

511
00:40:32,973 --> 00:40:35,574
[SPEAKER_19]: It was, you know, shop the mall, shop them all.

512
00:40:36,315 --> 00:40:38,116
[SPEAKER_19]: It's rape the mall, rape them all.

513
00:40:38,997 --> 00:40:40,358
[SPEAKER_19]: Gotta rape them all.

514
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,040
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyways...

515
00:40:45,649 --> 00:40:47,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, remember that word, piss?

516
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:49,071
[SPEAKER_07]: How funny that was last week?

517
00:40:49,512 --> 00:40:49,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

518
00:40:52,093 --> 00:41:03,721
[SPEAKER_07]: No, so anyways, games... We're going to be getting in the games business, so that means I can get an E3 using VPD now, and also hopefully get some free demos.

519
00:41:04,942 --> 00:41:05,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, demos!

520
00:41:08,304 --> 00:41:11,606
[SPEAKER_09]: SharkStroll, were you done with your thought before Loki so rudely interrupted you?

521
00:41:12,587 --> 00:41:14,148
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm boring this week, so...

522
00:41:20,821 --> 00:41:26,725
[SPEAKER_16]: I interviewed for the job I'm at now on Monday on the phone.

523
00:41:26,825 --> 00:41:28,807
[SPEAKER_16]: I interviewed in person on Wednesday at 9.

524
00:41:28,907 --> 00:41:31,789
[SPEAKER_16]: I found out I had the job at 1 and got in a car accident at 1.20.

525
00:41:32,149 --> 00:41:38,654
[SPEAKER_16]: You have this insane luck with car accidents when you do new exciting things.

526
00:41:38,674 --> 00:41:41,636
[SPEAKER_16]: $1,584 to fix a bumper and a back quarter panel.

527
00:41:42,136 --> 00:41:43,077
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crap.

528
00:41:43,657 --> 00:41:44,658
[SPEAKER_16]: That sucks.

529
00:41:45,354 --> 00:41:47,595
[SPEAKER_16]: Luckily, my insurance covered all but $250 of it.

530
00:41:48,215 --> 00:41:48,795
[SPEAKER_16]: That's decent.

531
00:41:49,115 --> 00:41:57,978
[SPEAKER_16]: And I might get $125 back if I can convince Geico that because I'm backing out doesn't mean that I have a greater duty of care to watch that I don't hit him considering he was backing out too.

532
00:41:59,119 --> 00:41:59,939
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't get that one.

533
00:42:00,339 --> 00:42:01,840
[SPEAKER_16]: Why it's more my fault, but okay.

534
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,320
[SPEAKER_20]: Because you're a woman.

535
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:04,921
[SPEAKER_20]: What, Nellie?

536
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:05,901
[SPEAKER_20]: Because you're a woman.

537
00:42:07,762 --> 00:42:10,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Which proves the point that women can't drive.

538
00:42:11,323 --> 00:42:11,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop.

539
00:42:12,427 --> 00:42:15,908
[SPEAKER_16]: I have some really nice videotapes I could throw at your head right now.

540
00:42:15,968 --> 00:42:18,309
[SPEAKER_16]: They're nice and heavy.

541
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:19,170
[SPEAKER_16]: That's hot.

542
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:19,590
[SPEAKER_16]: Flavor Flav!

543
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:19,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Flavor Flav!

544
00:42:38,035 --> 00:42:46,881
[SPEAKER_16]: Flava Flav, and Dave Coulee, and Brigitte Nielsen, and Charo, and Brian Starr.

545
00:42:47,561 --> 00:42:50,083
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, and Jordan Knight.

546
00:42:50,583 --> 00:42:50,963
Whatever.

547
00:42:51,544 --> 00:42:52,004
[SPEAKER_09]: What else is there?

548
00:42:52,084 --> 00:42:55,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, so you've been doing nothing but playing on your sidekick at work this week.

549
00:42:55,346 --> 00:42:55,706
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, pretty much.

550
00:42:56,107 --> 00:42:57,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Does Snoop do his own laundry?

551
00:42:57,888 --> 00:42:58,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Huh?

552
00:42:58,268 --> 00:42:59,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Does Snoop do his own laundry?

553
00:43:00,489 --> 00:43:01,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

554
00:43:03,051 --> 00:43:03,311
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

555
00:43:03,391 --> 00:43:04,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you have a comment?

556
00:43:04,672 --> 00:43:05,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Or are you just waving at the camera?

557
00:43:05,993 --> 00:43:06,473
[SPEAKER_09]: No styling?

558
00:43:06,493 --> 00:43:07,514
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

559
00:43:07,987 --> 00:43:13,350
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to see the webcam, www.orangeonstrider.com Moving on, it's my turn, dammit!

560
00:43:14,151 --> 00:43:16,152
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to take a turn, I know we still got Angel left to go.

561
00:43:16,212 --> 00:43:16,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on, bitch!

562
00:43:17,433 --> 00:43:19,754
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got something to say!

563
00:43:19,894 --> 00:43:20,955
[SPEAKER_13]: I've got something to say!

564
00:43:21,115 --> 00:43:23,957
[SPEAKER_13]: My boyfriend's retarded, so don't look at him on the camera, please.

565
00:43:24,337 --> 00:43:25,158
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't encourage him.

566
00:43:26,058 --> 00:43:29,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, my week and my day was okay.

567
00:43:30,061 --> 00:43:32,542
[SPEAKER_09]: I did a whole lot of nothing this week, really.

568
00:43:32,562 --> 00:43:35,004
[SPEAKER_09]: I played a lot of Final Fantasy XI, just like, you know, my...

569
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:37,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

570
00:43:53,412 --> 00:43:55,595
[SPEAKER_09]: and you guys know what a freaking lightweight I am.

571
00:43:55,635 --> 00:43:57,518
[SPEAKER_09]: You've heard the drunk shows we've done on Orange Islands Radio.

572
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:02,825
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how I was able to hold down that many shots without completely passing.

573
00:44:02,885 --> 00:44:07,911
[SPEAKER_09]: I did eventually pass out, but I was quite proud of myself considering I hadn't drank in a long time.

574
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:08,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Pixie Dust.

575
00:44:10,123 --> 00:44:15,467
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, did you pass out and they put a funnel in your mouth and then they shot the shot down for you?

576
00:44:15,747 --> 00:44:19,190
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I kept going... You were always falling asleep on the floor.

577
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:21,971
[SPEAKER_19]: I fell asleep on the floor like three times in my house.

578
00:44:22,052 --> 00:44:23,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody was doing shots together.

579
00:44:23,913 --> 00:44:26,575
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just the biggest pussy with the lowest alcohol tolerance.

580
00:44:27,295 --> 00:44:28,916
[SPEAKER_09]: And so everybody else was still coherent.

581
00:44:28,936 --> 00:44:33,640
[SPEAKER_09]: But then I'd be kind of like slumping on the table going, I need to cut myself off.

582
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:37,142
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they'll put another one in front of me and I'll be all, okay, drink it.

583
00:44:37,222 --> 00:44:37,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

584
00:44:46,983 --> 00:44:51,166
[SPEAKER_09]: No, thankfully Pixie Dust was not at the party, so nobody was putting makeup on me and making me look pretty.

585
00:44:51,366 --> 00:44:57,610
[SPEAKER_16]: At least you weren't like Verne Troyer in the first episode of Surreal Life Season 4, because he was naked and pissing in the corner of the weight room.

586
00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:06,937
[SPEAKER_16]: I was, however, going, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

587
00:45:09,238 --> 00:45:11,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, enough talking about VH1 shows.

588
00:45:13,066 --> 00:45:18,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at that, they're sitting there in the chat room right now, and one of my buddies that was there last night says, yeah, we shaved his ass.

589
00:45:20,151 --> 00:45:20,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Huh.

590
00:45:21,012 --> 00:45:21,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

591
00:45:21,613 --> 00:45:22,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I check it this morning?

592
00:45:24,795 --> 00:45:26,616
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to come inspect it, Pacey Dust?

593
00:45:27,497 --> 00:45:29,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Get the flashlight, it's pretty cavernous.

594
00:45:29,619 --> 00:45:29,899
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

595
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,282
[SPEAKER_09]: DDR Angel, last but certainly not least.

596
00:45:33,302 --> 00:45:34,142
[SPEAKER_09]: How was your week, how was your day?

597
00:45:35,403 --> 00:45:36,084
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, let's see.

598
00:45:36,524 --> 00:45:42,909
[SPEAKER_19]: Classes started this week, and normally I'd probably be going, uh, but

599
00:45:43,729 --> 00:45:47,852
[SPEAKER_19]: No, actually, scarily enough, I enjoyed myself this week.

600
00:45:48,533 --> 00:45:49,514
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a little scary.

601
00:45:49,594 --> 00:45:51,075
[SPEAKER_19]: School being enjoyable.

602
00:45:52,075 --> 00:45:53,497
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, anyway.

603
00:45:54,497 --> 00:46:04,365
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, yeah, other than that, uh, just like everyone else, Final Fantasy XI, Jamie, waiting, waiting, waiting.

604
00:46:06,141 --> 00:46:07,102
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not going to say it anymore.

605
00:46:07,362 --> 00:46:09,423
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

606
00:46:09,803 --> 00:46:13,625
[SPEAKER_19]: And actually, I actually split myself between three games now.

607
00:46:13,826 --> 00:46:19,949
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's now Final Fantasy XI there, and I've gotten back into Myst.

608
00:46:20,269 --> 00:46:20,670
[SPEAKER_19]: Help.

609
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:23,071
[SPEAKER_19]: Ah, Myst.

610
00:46:23,511 --> 00:46:25,372
[SPEAKER_19]: Nobody cares about that in this area.

611
00:46:25,813 --> 00:46:28,134
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't Myst like 15 years old, that game?

612
00:46:28,194 --> 00:46:29,615
[SPEAKER_09]: It's older than God.

613
00:46:30,069 --> 00:46:37,312
[SPEAKER_19]: Of course, but I had to start... I'm not going to comment that I have it for Saturn.

614
00:46:38,372 --> 00:46:39,272
[SPEAKER_19]: Cool.

615
00:46:40,293 --> 00:46:57,338
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I never got to really get to play that game, so they came out with a DVD version a little while back, so I have all three of those, the first three in the series, and then I got the Complete Chronicles, which is like a little offshoot of the...

616
00:47:00,106 --> 00:47:05,889
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I have too many games to play and school to deal with.

617
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:08,190
[SPEAKER_19]: That's okay.

618
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:09,311
[SPEAKER_19]: Final Fantasy XI tomorrow.

619
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:09,671
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

620
00:47:10,731 --> 00:47:11,151
[SPEAKER_32]: Or tonight.

621
00:47:11,572 --> 00:47:12,552
[SPEAKER_32]: I beat it last week.

622
00:47:14,433 --> 00:47:15,534
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't beat Final Fantasy XI.

623
00:47:15,574 --> 00:47:16,094
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, you can.

624
00:47:16,114 --> 00:47:17,394
[SPEAKER_32]: The original Final Fantasy XI.

625
00:47:17,414 --> 00:47:18,475
[SPEAKER_32]: You can beat the storyline.

626
00:47:18,515 --> 00:47:19,435
[SPEAKER_32]: I played the storyline.

627
00:47:19,475 --> 00:47:20,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay, okay.

628
00:47:20,276 --> 00:47:20,756
[SPEAKER_09]: That was fun.

629
00:47:21,597 --> 00:47:21,977
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotcha.

630
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on.

631
00:47:27,179 --> 00:47:28,140
[SPEAKER_09]: They can't hear you, dear.

632
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:28,680
[SPEAKER_09]: They can't hear you.

633
00:47:29,352 --> 00:47:32,934
[SPEAKER_19]: I spent it laying on the bed watching my boyfriend play Final Fantasy XI.

634
00:47:33,194 --> 00:47:35,175
[SPEAKER_19]: How depressing is that?

635
00:47:37,497 --> 00:47:38,757
[SPEAKER_19]: For my vacation.

636
00:47:38,857 --> 00:47:39,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Were you at least giving him head?

637
00:47:39,938 --> 00:47:43,880
[SPEAKER_13]: The majority of my vacation was sucked into Final Fantasy XI.

638
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:45,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Were you giving him head while he was doing it?

639
00:47:46,021 --> 00:47:47,122
[SPEAKER_13]: Nah, the table's too small.

640
00:47:47,222 --> 00:47:48,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, whoa, hey.

641
00:47:48,483 --> 00:47:49,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Ho, ho, ho.

642
00:47:49,183 --> 00:47:49,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

643
00:47:49,724 --> 00:47:49,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

644
00:47:50,064 --> 00:47:50,384
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

645
00:47:50,504 --> 00:47:50,924
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

646
00:47:51,104 --> 00:47:51,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

647
00:47:51,365 --> 00:47:51,625
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

648
00:47:58,235 --> 00:48:00,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on, we're going to go to a break, I think.

649
00:48:00,897 --> 00:48:08,583
[SPEAKER_09]: And in this break, now when we were in that last break there, the chat room was starting to go, you guys play these songs all the time.

650
00:48:08,683 --> 00:48:11,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't you play some songs we don't ever hear?

651
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:12,886
[SPEAKER_09]: What's wrong with you guys?

652
00:48:13,046 --> 00:48:14,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Play some new songs.

653
00:48:14,508 --> 00:48:14,748
[SPEAKER_09]: Fine.

654
00:48:15,128 --> 00:48:23,034
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm digging into the obscure stuff, the stuff we don't really play a whole lot, and I'm going to try and play some new stuff that we don't play on Orange Launch Radio a whole lot.

655
00:48:24,744 --> 00:48:26,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, but see, we play that one a bit.

656
00:48:27,366 --> 00:48:31,708
[SPEAKER_09]: I can do that in a later break, but I gotta do stuff that jumps out at me saying we don't really play this.

657
00:48:31,728 --> 00:48:34,250
[SPEAKER_19]: Dig into the bowels of 2DX Substream.

658
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:42,315
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna dig into the bowels here, but what I have queued up right now, I have the bonus stage from the newest Taiko no Tatooine in Japan.

659
00:48:42,375 --> 00:48:44,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I know we've never played that one, because Navi just sent it to me this week.

660
00:48:45,376 --> 00:48:45,857
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called...

661
00:48:46,437 --> 00:49:12,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Koi Bumi 2000, we're going to play that and then we have from 2DX Red, I know a lot of folks have heard this but we haven't played this song on Orange Lounge Radio and it has the word fuck in it, so I have to play it, so listen carefully but it goes, you have to listen carefully because it goes, fuck me and it's called Injection of Love and then we're going to play something, I'm going to play some like old ass 5 key song as well so we will be back after this

662
00:49:13,203 --> 00:49:17,772
[SPEAKER_09]: with some rare music stuff, and we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio after this.

663
00:49:37,743 --> 00:49:38,184
[SPEAKER_26]: DarkSakura

664
00:49:54,284 --> 00:49:55,365
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you for watching!

665
00:50:39,364 --> 00:50:40,428
Thanks for watching!

666
00:51:56,301 --> 00:51:57,462
Thank you for watching!

667
00:52:46,677 --> 00:52:47,326
DarkSakura

668
00:53:31,858 --> 00:53:33,278
Thanks for watching!

669
00:54:32,907 --> 00:54:43,573
[SPEAKER_26]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio and oh my lord, there's a gazillion people in the house now.

670
00:54:53,729 --> 00:55:02,731
[SPEAKER_09]: I think somewhere during that break, Explicit showed up, and RicePrincess and LankyStyle from Thursday Nights Outside the Box showed up as well.

671
00:55:03,391 --> 00:55:05,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Holy crap, there's a lot of people here.

672
00:55:05,931 --> 00:55:10,012
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess we might as well continue with the how was your week, how was your day bit real fast for the people that just got here.

673
00:55:12,233 --> 00:55:13,513
[SPEAKER_09]: LankyStyle, how was your week, how was your day?

674
00:55:14,813 --> 00:55:19,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Same as always, just work, slaved over the phone, working for the devil.

675
00:55:21,075 --> 00:55:21,575
[SPEAKER_09]: I hear that.

676
00:55:21,835 --> 00:55:23,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Rice Princess, how was your week, how was your day?

677
00:55:24,896 --> 00:55:25,797
[SPEAKER_09]: She just said pretty good.

678
00:55:27,898 --> 00:55:28,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Explicit?

679
00:55:31,239 --> 00:55:31,939
[SPEAKER_31]: It's pretty good.

680
00:55:32,519 --> 00:55:40,062
[SPEAKER_31]: Just getting some more replies with Determine and actually I'm sending applications on PI for those who cannot pre-register online and stuff.

681
00:55:41,183 --> 00:55:44,564
[SPEAKER_31]: And just got off of CCL to see what new arcades they have gotten.

682
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:47,941
[SPEAKER_31]: Of course, everyone knows they have 6th style there.

683
00:55:48,901 --> 00:55:53,382
[SPEAKER_31]: And they're replacing one of the DDR machines with the In The Groove machine.

684
00:55:53,402 --> 00:55:54,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, what?

685
00:55:54,162 --> 00:55:54,362
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

686
00:55:55,222 --> 00:55:56,542
[SPEAKER_09]: They have 6th style at CCL?

687
00:55:57,382 --> 00:55:59,383
[SPEAKER_31]: No, it's just B-Mania 3.

688
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:00,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, B-Mania 3.

689
00:56:00,503 --> 00:56:01,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'd heard about that.

690
00:56:01,583 --> 00:56:02,263
[SPEAKER_31]: Not 2DX.

691
00:56:03,284 --> 00:56:03,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

692
00:56:04,384 --> 00:56:04,804
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotcha.

693
00:56:04,964 --> 00:56:06,804
[SPEAKER_31]: You know how crowded that's going to be in CCL.

694
00:56:09,305 --> 00:56:09,625
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

695
00:56:11,005 --> 00:56:12,746
[SPEAKER_31]: The rest will be held in my FUs.

696
00:56:12,926 --> 00:56:13,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, goody, goody.

697
00:56:13,906 --> 00:56:14,206
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

698
00:56:15,017 --> 00:56:15,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on.

699
00:56:16,157 --> 00:56:16,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, guys.

700
00:56:16,857 --> 00:56:18,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what can I say in studio here?

701
00:56:18,658 --> 00:56:19,778
[SPEAKER_09]: There's, what, like 11 people here?

702
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:20,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Pull up a floor.

703
00:56:22,898 --> 00:56:24,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Please try not to fart in studio.

704
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:25,919
[SPEAKER_09]: We'd appreciate that.

705
00:56:27,639 --> 00:56:28,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on.

706
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:34,921
[SPEAKER_09]: I noticed Loki's over on our webcam there at www.orangeentrader.com and he's holding up pieces of this modified Xbox.

707
00:56:35,241 --> 00:56:41,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell us, for the listeners that haven't heard about what you're doing here with this Xbox, tell us about this little project that you've picked up, Loki, about modifying an Xbox.

708
00:56:42,611 --> 00:56:43,292
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

709
00:56:58,419 --> 00:57:18,506
[SPEAKER_07]: No, um, usually they're fanless, but this one being a 1 gigahertz processor is not fanless, but they're really fucking small, so you're, you know, able to put them in the really small, um, cases, like the Xbox case here, so it's actually gonna have, the way I have it working right now is it's actually gonna run all off a battery.

710
00:57:19,656 --> 00:57:21,457
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's going to be 100% portable.

711
00:57:21,577 --> 00:57:30,023
[SPEAKER_07]: For a monitor, I'm actually using a portable PlayStation PS1 LCD screen that's 5 inches.

712
00:57:31,724 --> 00:57:32,945
[SPEAKER_07]: All going to be portable, though.

713
00:57:33,165 --> 00:57:33,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Completely 100%.

714
00:57:33,685 --> 00:57:36,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Nerd!

715
00:57:37,388 --> 00:57:44,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, it's us four, so we can, you know, do our, you know, Orange Lounge Radio To Go editions from the road, from E3.

716
00:57:46,286 --> 00:57:46,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Nerds!

717
00:58:09,454 --> 00:58:13,158
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, I'm pictochatting with someone sitting right next to me.

718
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:14,520
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

719
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:17,183
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd be playing DS2, but I left it at my buddy's house.

720
00:58:17,463 --> 00:58:18,404
[SPEAKER_09]: Whoops, in my jacket.

721
00:58:18,485 --> 00:58:19,145
[SPEAKER_32]: Shame on you.

722
00:58:22,449 --> 00:58:22,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well.

723
00:58:23,691 --> 00:58:24,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, um...

724
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:29,323
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to get to some actual DDR news, you guys.

725
00:58:29,984 --> 00:58:33,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Actual news about a really big rhythm music game going on right now.

726
00:58:34,688 --> 00:58:41,414
[SPEAKER_09]: As we talked about a couple weeks ago, there's going to be a brand new DDR game coming out on the GameCube, and it's called DDR with Mario.

727
00:58:42,255 --> 00:58:50,342
[SPEAKER_09]: And we knew that we were going to be getting some more information on this game after the Tokyo, what was it, the Tokyo Hobby Fair or something like that that just took place very recently?

728
00:58:51,583 --> 00:58:52,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I screw up the name?

729
00:58:52,404 --> 00:58:52,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably.

730
00:58:53,459 --> 00:59:00,242
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyway, this Tokyo Fair just happened, and not only did we get a lot more information about this game, we got videos.

731
00:59:00,945 --> 00:59:10,713
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to show some videos in studio right now, and for those of you on stream, I know this makes for really great radio, but for those of you on stream, you can actually listen to this over the stream.

732
00:59:10,733 --> 00:59:17,239
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be playing this for you guys, and what's really cool is that you can actually hear some of the music that's going to be in DDR Mario through this.

733
00:59:17,619 --> 00:59:24,185
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to play this, and this first video should be a song that you guys really recognize, at least I hope so.

734
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:36,228
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you want to check out these videos for yourself, just head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on the news story that we posted earlier about this.

735
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:39,451
[SPEAKER_19]: By the way, thank Dan for those.

736
00:59:40,172 --> 00:59:40,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, did he find those?

737
00:59:41,032 --> 00:59:42,413
[SPEAKER_19]: Dan found those for me last night.

738
00:59:42,774 --> 00:59:43,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Very nice.

739
00:59:44,155 --> 00:59:51,761
[SPEAKER_19]: By the way, if anybody happens to have an IGN Insider account, please let us know because we need your assistance.

740
00:59:52,842 --> 00:59:53,182
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

741
00:59:53,587 --> 00:59:57,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, here's one video, and listen carefully for the song that's playing in the background.

742
00:59:57,691 --> 00:59:58,752
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds very familiar.

743
01:00:14,393 --> 01:00:15,454
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

744
01:00:56,210 --> 01:00:57,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I want to point this out in the video.

745
01:00:57,731 --> 01:00:59,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me turn this down a little bit.

746
01:00:59,592 --> 01:01:00,793
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you guys can hear the song.

747
01:01:01,354 --> 01:01:05,998
[SPEAKER_09]: In the video, you'll notice that some of the arrows are actually pictures of Boo.

748
01:01:06,638 --> 01:01:07,239
[SPEAKER_09]: The little Boo.

749
01:01:08,192 --> 01:01:13,976
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you step on that, it makes this giant ghost appear on your opponent's side that blocks the arrows.

750
01:01:14,496 --> 01:01:17,078
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're incorporating some of the Versus Mode stuff in it.

751
01:01:25,944 --> 01:01:30,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Very interesting there, because you notice that the DDR Max announcer was in that.

752
01:01:30,887 --> 01:01:31,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Perfect!

753
01:01:31,887 --> 01:01:32,768
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, all that stuff.

754
01:01:33,448 --> 01:01:36,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Very... I don't know if it's Thomas Howard, I don't know.

755
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:37,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

756
01:01:37,191 --> 01:01:37,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

757
01:01:38,455 --> 01:01:42,416
[SPEAKER_09]: The lady's voice in the background, we think, is just at the show.

758
01:01:42,476 --> 01:01:43,857
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't think it's actually a part of the game.

759
01:01:43,897 --> 01:01:44,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, she's just a part of the show.

760
01:01:45,437 --> 01:01:48,078
[SPEAKER_09]: But you could probably hear it in the background, that medley that's playing.

761
01:01:48,358 --> 01:01:50,419
[SPEAKER_09]: You knew that this would happen in a DDR Mario game.

762
01:01:50,459 --> 01:01:51,819
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a dance version of the Mario Bros.

763
01:01:51,839 --> 01:01:51,939
[SPEAKER_09]: theme.

764
01:01:51,959 --> 01:01:54,920
[SPEAKER_09]: From Super Mario 2, or USA, first stage.

765
01:02:01,226 --> 01:02:02,608
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, so very interesting there.

766
01:02:02,989 --> 01:02:05,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, this next one is very interesting.

767
01:02:05,152 --> 01:02:07,495
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to show you this one, the last clip.

768
01:02:07,535 --> 01:02:08,396
[SPEAKER_09]: It's clip number four.

769
01:02:08,817 --> 01:02:12,642
[SPEAKER_09]: This is one of my favorites because they actually have Mario and Luigi dancing in it.

770
01:02:13,022 --> 01:02:15,546
[SPEAKER_09]: But this will allow you to hear one of the other songs that's in the game.

771
01:02:16,187 --> 01:02:16,627
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um...

772
01:02:17,469 --> 01:02:25,331
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to get a little hint of the gameplay, because you'll notice the arrows aren't only just replaced with the boos, but they also have the Goombas and the Koopa Troopas.

773
01:02:25,771 --> 01:02:26,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Very interesting.

774
01:02:26,572 --> 01:02:27,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Very Nintendo-fied, this game.

775
01:02:27,832 --> 01:02:29,432
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to talk about it a little more here in a minute.

776
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:38,915
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me get this other clip queued up here, and we'll watch it in studio, and you guys can hear a clip of the song that's going to be in DDR with Mario. ...

777
01:02:46,229 --> 01:02:50,516
[SPEAKER_09]: and in this video they have para para girls doing a routine to the song

778
01:03:09,318 --> 01:03:13,881
[SPEAKER_09]: And they have girls paraparrying to a basic song on DDR Mario here.

779
01:03:20,506 --> 01:03:24,749
[SPEAKER_09]: And male DDR fans everywhere have a new masturbatory video to watch.

780
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:29,032
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to point out though, look how Mario dances.

781
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:31,891
[SPEAKER_26]: Look at Luigi!

782
01:03:32,011 --> 01:03:32,771
[SPEAKER_26]: He's making waves!

783
01:03:32,811 --> 01:03:33,592
[SPEAKER_26]: He's doing the Watusi!

784
01:03:33,612 --> 01:03:35,553
[SPEAKER_26]: See, there's a Koopa Troopa that just went up.

785
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:55,172
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm rather impressed that they can patapata in there too

786
01:04:21,815 --> 01:04:22,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Very interesting.

787
01:04:23,876 --> 01:04:30,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I realize you guys at home listening right now can't really see what we're watching, but you can get the videos on the website.

788
01:04:30,641 --> 01:04:36,785
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got to be interesting also to hear the songs there, but what do you guys think now that you've seen a little bit of DDR Mario in action?

789
01:04:36,985 --> 01:04:40,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on, let me tell you guys a little bit more information about this game going on.

790
01:04:40,888 --> 01:04:49,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, what's going on is that they only were able to check out a demo version, of course, naturally, at the Tokyo...

791
01:04:52,709 --> 01:04:54,265
[SPEAKER_09]: The World Hobby Fair, that's it.

792
01:04:54,751 --> 01:04:55,511
[SPEAKER_09]: The World Hobby Fair.

793
01:04:55,531 --> 01:04:58,692
[SPEAKER_09]: They were only able to have a little mini version of the game.

794
01:04:58,732 --> 01:05:00,233
[SPEAKER_09]: And here's what the mini version featured.

795
01:05:00,693 --> 01:05:03,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that it kind of featured only the two-player mode.

796
01:05:03,734 --> 01:05:06,295
[SPEAKER_09]: And Mario and Luigi were the only playable characters in it.

797
01:05:06,595 --> 01:05:08,435
[SPEAKER_09]: And there were only about seven songs.

798
01:05:08,735 --> 01:05:12,877
[SPEAKER_09]: And it does talk about that Goomba and Koopa show up as special icons.

799
01:05:13,237 --> 01:05:17,578
[SPEAKER_09]: When you see a Goomba icon, if you tap the appropriate space on the dance pad, it smashes it.

800
01:05:17,918 --> 01:05:21,999
[SPEAKER_09]: If you smash a Koopa twice, you'll send it flying back down the column.

801
01:05:22,099 --> 01:05:23,640
[SPEAKER_09]: And it'll knock out all the other arrows.

802
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:24,640
[SPEAKER_09]: in the column.

803
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:29,781
[SPEAKER_09]: So they've come up with all these interesting little, very Nintendo-like things.

804
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:33,622
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the boo, if you step on the boo, it makes the ghost bigger on the other side and it hides the arrows.

805
01:05:33,882 --> 01:05:36,202
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, of course, there's a little picture of the dance mat here.

806
01:05:37,843 --> 01:05:38,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Very interesting.

807
01:05:40,503 --> 01:05:46,284
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to head on over to DDR Freak because I know on the thread there over DDR Freak they were talking about some of the songs that are actually going to be in it.

808
01:05:46,524 --> 01:05:49,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, you heard there the song from Super Mario Bros.

809
01:05:49,205 --> 01:05:50,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Part 2, Stage 1 in it.

810
01:05:51,388 --> 01:05:53,089
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you guys think after seeing some of those videos?

811
01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:55,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, you were the one that showed me these videos in the first place.

812
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:55,631
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think?

813
01:05:56,371 --> 01:05:57,472
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's adorable.

814
01:05:59,013 --> 01:06:02,435
[SPEAKER_19]: I just think it's cool watching them do the cute little dances and turning around.

815
01:06:02,695 --> 01:06:03,475
[SPEAKER_19]: And then the big boo.

816
01:06:04,136 --> 01:06:04,936
[SPEAKER_19]: It had the big boo.

817
01:06:05,237 --> 01:06:06,377
[SPEAKER_19]: And I love the big boo.

818
01:06:08,639 --> 01:06:12,501
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm quoting from a post here from Unknown Gamer over on DDR Freak.

819
01:06:12,541 --> 01:06:15,343
[SPEAKER_09]: It's post number 202 in the GameCube DDR thread.

820
01:06:15,723 --> 01:06:18,024
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're saying some of the songs that they've translated...

821
01:06:19,432 --> 01:06:23,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see, we have Here We Go from Super Mario Bros., Hoppin' Choppin' from Super Mario Bros.

822
01:06:24,013 --> 01:06:28,775
[SPEAKER_09]: USA, and then look at this, Para Para Carmen, like the opera Carmen.

823
01:06:29,355 --> 01:06:29,715
[SPEAKER_09]: That's wrong.

824
01:06:29,735 --> 01:06:30,736
[SPEAKER_09]: A Para Para version.

825
01:06:31,316 --> 01:06:37,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Mozart in the Pipe, Then Go the You, A Small Night's Music.

826
01:06:37,798 --> 01:06:40,079
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the name of the song, Then Go the Pipe.

827
01:06:42,879 --> 01:06:47,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Credit there to Unknown Gamer over at DDR Freak for translating some of those and putting them in a post there.

828
01:06:48,374 --> 01:06:50,155
[SPEAKER_09]: You know my thoughts on this?

829
01:06:50,315 --> 01:06:51,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'll get to my thoughts.

830
01:06:51,075 --> 01:06:51,815
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to hear you guys.

831
01:06:51,835 --> 01:06:52,395
[SPEAKER_09]: I've talked enough.

832
01:06:53,196 --> 01:06:56,557
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to know if there's going to be a mushroom icon.

833
01:06:56,577 --> 01:07:00,038
[SPEAKER_02]: If you step on that, it gives a hallucinogenic effect to the other player or something.

834
01:07:02,859 --> 01:07:05,500
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole game seems like a big hallucinogenic effect.

835
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:08,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what would you expect, though, from this?

836
01:07:08,641 --> 01:07:10,121
[SPEAKER_09]: DDR with Mario, honestly.

837
01:07:13,603 --> 01:07:13,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

838
01:07:14,763 --> 01:07:14,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

839
01:07:15,296 --> 01:07:16,436
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it looks fun.

840
01:07:16,796 --> 01:07:22,658
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it'd be interesting to, I think mainly the big thing for me is just the music, you know, see what they're going to do with the Nintendo tunes.

841
01:07:24,478 --> 01:07:28,539
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they should have a secret, like, other Nintendo characters thing in there too, though.

842
01:07:28,579 --> 01:07:32,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, you got Samus, and you get Samus music.

843
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:35,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude, the Samus shuffle, I don't know.

844
01:07:38,482 --> 01:07:40,682
[SPEAKER_09]: The Morph Ball slide, I don't know.

845
01:07:41,383 --> 01:07:42,763
[SPEAKER_09]: How about Mel, Mel B?

846
01:07:44,191 --> 01:07:44,772
[SPEAKER_35]: Um, gosh.

847
01:07:44,812 --> 01:07:46,933
[SPEAKER_09]: You gotta admit, that Power Par Freestyle was pretty hot.

848
01:07:47,513 --> 01:07:55,178
[SPEAKER_35]: Um, yeah, I must say, it reinforces my belief that, pretty much, Power Par is a female thing, and it only looks good that way.

849
01:07:56,219 --> 01:08:00,662
[SPEAKER_35]: But, um, that said, I mean, looking at the gameplay and stuff, it reminds me a lot of basically just...

850
01:08:01,252 --> 01:08:04,335
[SPEAKER_35]: Disney Rave Magic on Crack, which, you know, is a cool thing.

851
01:08:04,415 --> 01:08:10,019
[SPEAKER_35]: It's like one of those concepts that Ultramix 2, you know, kind of tried to do with its battle mode and like other gimmicks.

852
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:14,783
[SPEAKER_35]: This one kind of takes into a more, I guess, recognizable form, which is kind of cool.

853
01:08:15,464 --> 01:08:27,594
[SPEAKER_35]: It's kind of neat to see the music that seems to hear, you know, what I heard as far as music-wise, but hypothetically, if this comes out, say, you know, to a stateside release, I can't see it doing a whole lot better, you know.

854
01:08:27,834 --> 01:08:28,435
[SPEAKER_35]: It's sort of like

855
01:08:29,096 --> 01:08:30,177
[SPEAKER_35]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

856
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:50,911
[SPEAKER_35]: DDR Ultramix 1

857
01:09:13,362 --> 01:09:14,022
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so other comments?

858
01:09:14,062 --> 01:09:14,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Angel.

859
01:09:14,202 --> 01:09:16,403
[SPEAKER_09]: It does have potential, though, so you never know.

860
01:09:41,576 --> 01:09:43,337
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I thought it was really cool.

861
01:09:43,457 --> 01:09:46,438
[SPEAKER_19]: I would probably be one of those people to be like, oh, I'm still getting that.

862
01:09:47,178 --> 01:09:50,320
[SPEAKER_19]: Just because it's DDR and it's cute and whatever.

863
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:53,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you say one of the songs called Mozart on the Pipe?

864
01:09:54,282 --> 01:09:55,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like that.

865
01:09:55,402 --> 01:09:56,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Stoner DDR is right, yeah.

866
01:09:57,543 --> 01:09:59,364
[SPEAKER_35]: I didn't know Mary and Barry was Mozart.

867
01:10:01,945 --> 01:10:05,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other thoughts from those of you guys on the couch or over at Sharks Girl?

868
01:10:05,426 --> 01:10:06,387
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know anybody.

869
01:10:07,067 --> 01:10:08,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to pick up DDR Mario Sharks Girl?

870
01:10:08,808 --> 01:10:08,848
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

871
01:10:10,572 --> 01:10:12,113
[SPEAKER_09]: What is it about this game that looks so cool?

872
01:10:12,513 --> 01:10:15,334
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know, it's just, it's something different for once.

873
01:10:15,715 --> 01:10:19,496
[SPEAKER_10]: I think, it's just, it's so gay.

874
01:10:22,438 --> 01:10:23,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, whoa.

875
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:27,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch your language, Rob.

876
01:10:29,261 --> 01:10:34,183
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't mean gay as in butt sex, I mean gay as in happy.

877
01:10:34,263 --> 01:10:34,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, Eminem.

878
01:10:39,457 --> 01:10:42,038
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, look at Disney Rave, especially like the U.S.

879
01:10:42,278 --> 01:10:43,039
[SPEAKER_16]: one, Disney Mix.

880
01:10:43,499 --> 01:10:46,360
[SPEAKER_16]: Dude, you can't pick that up anywhere for under like $130.

881
01:10:47,041 --> 01:10:47,841
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, my God.

882
01:10:47,861 --> 01:10:49,282
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, check eBay.

883
01:10:49,922 --> 01:10:51,883
[SPEAKER_19]: I found it at Network Video for cheap.

884
01:10:52,603 --> 01:10:54,124
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you get the Japanese or the American one?

885
01:10:54,964 --> 01:10:59,006
[SPEAKER_19]: The American one is the one that's going for... Oh, I'm talking about the one on the Nintendo 64.

886
01:10:59,066 --> 01:10:59,767
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, that one.

887
01:11:01,187 --> 01:11:02,748
[SPEAKER_19]: But I have both of them anyway.

888
01:11:03,008 --> 01:11:03,949
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, well, so does Mel.

889
01:11:04,009 --> 01:11:04,829
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, it's no big deal.

890
01:11:04,889 --> 01:11:06,470
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know, it's like people like...

891
01:11:07,842 --> 01:11:09,483
[SPEAKER_16]: I really hope Princess Peach is an unlockable character.

892
01:11:09,503 --> 01:11:09,544
[SPEAKER_16]: If...

893
01:11:35,655 --> 01:11:37,656
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, this is my letter to Nintendo.

894
01:11:38,276 --> 01:11:46,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear Nintendo, In the upcoming game, DDR with Mario, I hereby request that Princess Peach be a playable character.

895
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:50,722
[SPEAKER_09]: If this is to be the case, I will play your game every day.

896
01:11:51,323 --> 01:11:52,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Drunk off my ass.

897
01:11:52,964 --> 01:11:53,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Naked.

898
01:11:54,584 --> 01:12:00,107
[SPEAKER_02]: You know they're gonna pull the whole, was it, um, was it the ME and Ultramix 2 thing?

899
01:12:00,327 --> 01:12:00,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that what it was?

900
01:12:01,008 --> 01:12:01,868
[SPEAKER_02]: From Ultramix 2 or whatever?

901
01:12:02,588 --> 01:12:03,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the Coochie Cutters?

902
01:12:03,749 --> 01:12:09,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, like, uh, with, uh, they'll do that with Princess Peach, she'll be all, like, whored out and stuff, the Daisy Dukes, and it's like, woo!

903
01:12:10,094 --> 01:12:10,775
[SPEAKER_33]: That'd be beautiful.

904
01:12:10,835 --> 01:12:11,515
[SPEAKER_33]: Or not.

905
01:12:12,736 --> 01:12:16,599
[SPEAKER_16]: If you're a girl, you're with me, it sucks trying to play DDR in a skirt, okay?

906
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:20,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they better put her in, like, hot pants or something, I don't know.

907
01:12:22,564 --> 01:12:26,307
[SPEAKER_09]: If the only reason you want Princess Peach in DDR is for an upskirt cam...

908
01:12:27,353 --> 01:12:28,754
[SPEAKER_09]: You get that in Super Smash Bros.

909
01:12:28,795 --> 01:12:29,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Melee, my friend.

910
01:12:30,176 --> 01:12:33,459
[SPEAKER_16]: And may I also say it sucks trying to play DDR in platform boots.

911
01:12:33,559 --> 01:12:38,083
[SPEAKER_16]: Been there, done that, failed.

912
01:12:38,223 --> 01:12:42,066
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, my first time on a DDR machine was in somebody else's Broken in Combat boots.

913
01:12:43,407 --> 01:12:49,232
[SPEAKER_19]: I was cosplaying as Jill Valentine from Resident Evil.

914
01:12:50,093 --> 01:12:50,954
[SPEAKER_19]: That was pain.

915
01:12:51,815 --> 01:12:52,996
[SPEAKER_19]: Utter and complete pain.

916
01:12:54,068 --> 01:13:02,371
[SPEAKER_16]: One of my first times on a DDR machine, especially alone, I was wearing four-inch heels with two-and-a-half-inch platform boots, and I failed Butterfly Basic.

917
01:13:02,692 --> 01:13:03,392
[SPEAKER_16]: I sucked.

918
01:13:04,973 --> 01:13:06,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't say I've ever played with platform shoes.

919
01:13:07,594 --> 01:13:08,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Or high heels.

920
01:13:08,414 --> 01:13:08,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank goodness.

921
01:13:10,675 --> 01:13:12,516
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish I could say the same, but no, I'm kidding.

922
01:13:12,696 --> 01:13:13,056
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't.

923
01:13:13,236 --> 01:13:13,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, wait.

924
01:13:13,636 --> 01:13:14,416
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Dick, huh?

925
01:13:15,757 --> 01:13:16,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Aha!

926
01:13:16,677 --> 01:13:17,278
[SPEAKER_09]: You funny.

927
01:13:17,698 --> 01:13:18,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Failed.

928
01:13:18,058 --> 01:13:19,458
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, Rob, I can lend you the boots.

929
01:13:19,478 --> 01:13:20,039
[SPEAKER_16]: I still got them.

930
01:13:20,099 --> 01:13:20,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey!

931
01:13:20,299 --> 01:13:20,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

932
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:23,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

933
01:13:23,544 --> 01:13:24,745
[SPEAKER_31]: Are you guys still doing comments?

934
01:13:26,346 --> 01:13:28,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Mario, what do you want to say about DDR Mario?

935
01:13:29,408 --> 01:13:30,910
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, I think it's a very good concept.

936
01:13:30,970 --> 01:13:35,613
[SPEAKER_31]: Of course, like everyone says, anything with Mario and Luigi would sell, in a way.

937
01:13:35,993 --> 01:13:40,917
[SPEAKER_31]: And with the new DDR pads for the GameCube, who knows what they'll do with Mario Party 7, maybe.

938
01:13:43,599 --> 01:13:44,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, God.

939
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:46,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Mario Party 7, I didn't even think about that.

940
01:13:46,882 --> 01:13:50,324
[SPEAKER_09]: What's going to be the asinine peripheral that's going to go with Mario Party 7?

941
01:13:50,404 --> 01:13:51,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably this.

942
01:13:53,266 --> 01:13:56,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you seriously played Mario Party 6 with a microphone?

943
01:13:56,808 --> 01:13:57,149
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

944
01:13:57,889 --> 01:13:58,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Move up.

945
01:14:00,230 --> 01:14:01,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Goomba.

946
01:14:01,391 --> 01:14:01,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Goomba.

947
01:14:02,192 --> 01:14:03,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Mario Party!

948
01:14:07,675 --> 01:14:11,998
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you have to go faster, faster, faster, faster, faster, faster, faster, faster!

949
01:14:12,178 --> 01:14:12,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Mario Party!

950
01:14:13,159 --> 01:14:13,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Mario Party!

951
01:14:14,119 --> 01:14:14,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Mario Party!

952
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:18,422
[SPEAKER_09]: This is seriously what playing Mario Party 6 sounds like.

953
01:14:21,144 --> 01:14:21,364
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay.

954
01:14:23,286 --> 01:14:24,067
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh my gosh.

955
01:14:24,087 --> 01:14:30,212
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my gosh.

956
01:14:31,513 --> 01:14:40,300
[SPEAKER_31]: Anyways, but since how like Donkey Kong became like a good, a pretty decent success seller, I think this would sell pretty well.

957
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:50,008
[SPEAKER_31]: I wonder what it's going to do with like some of the features, maybe a Koopa Shell while playing the game, and if you touch it you lose health, maybe, sort of like mines, fucking set mania in a way.

958
01:14:51,630 --> 01:14:55,631
[SPEAKER_31]: or if they play a damn hard song, they actually consider pipe raping or so.

959
01:14:57,591 --> 01:14:57,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Pipe.

960
01:14:58,832 --> 01:14:59,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Pipe raping.

961
01:14:59,732 --> 01:15:00,352
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell?

962
01:15:04,193 --> 01:15:04,593
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

963
01:15:06,713 --> 01:15:07,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on.

964
01:15:07,513 --> 01:15:08,814
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we're going to go to a break.

965
01:15:08,914 --> 01:15:13,955
[SPEAKER_09]: When we come back from this break, we're going to do a little more news and then the Orange Lounge Radio cage match when we come back.

966
01:15:15,726 --> 01:15:16,126
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

967
01:15:16,206 --> 01:15:22,270
[SPEAKER_09]: I just realized I lost all my Poppin' Music 9 consumer tracks when I got my new hard drive, so I don't have that song you wanted.

968
01:15:22,290 --> 01:15:22,891
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crappy.

969
01:15:22,911 --> 01:15:23,191
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

970
01:15:23,211 --> 01:15:24,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there something else you wanted to hear, darling?

971
01:15:25,152 --> 01:15:25,892
[SPEAKER_00]: The Safari.

972
01:15:26,413 --> 01:15:27,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, you got it.

973
01:15:27,533 --> 01:15:28,154
[SPEAKER_09]: The Safari.

974
01:15:29,214 --> 01:15:36,719
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be back after this break featuring starting it off with The Safari, and we'll be back with the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, etc., etc.

975
01:15:36,819 --> 01:15:43,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember, if you want to participate in tonight's Cage Match, you've got to be in the chat room, or else it just sucks to be you.

976
01:15:43,103 --> 01:15:44,504
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio.

977
01:16:05,343 --> 01:16:06,124
Thanks for watching!

978
01:17:46,053 --> 01:17:48,014
Thanks for watching!

979
01:19:19,617 --> 01:19:20,619
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you for watching!

980
01:20:36,651 --> 01:20:38,113
[SPEAKER_26]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

981
01:21:03,928 --> 01:21:04,890
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you for watching!

982
01:21:37,502 --> 01:21:39,083
[SPEAKER_26]: Gaming Radio, so uncensored.

983
01:22:07,177 --> 01:22:11,720
[SPEAKER_09]: and even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

984
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:13,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio.

985
01:22:17,584 --> 01:22:19,965
[SPEAKER_09]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

986
01:22:21,046 --> 01:22:22,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for tuning in tonight, boys and girls.

987
01:22:23,507 --> 01:22:24,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Great turnout.

988
01:22:24,288 --> 01:22:24,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, guys.

989
01:22:25,028 --> 01:22:27,430
[SPEAKER_09]: We love it when our ratings get whored up.

990
01:22:27,850 --> 01:22:29,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Not only in studio, but online as well.

991
01:22:30,352 --> 01:22:33,934
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we broke a record in the chat room with well over 40 people in chat.

992
01:22:34,014 --> 01:22:34,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty crazy.

993
01:22:35,255 --> 01:22:35,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

994
01:22:36,875 --> 01:22:39,762
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we got more people in here than I've seen in a long time.

995
01:22:39,802 --> 01:22:40,443
[SPEAKER_09]: This is great.

996
01:22:41,004 --> 01:22:41,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you guys very much.

997
01:22:43,416 --> 01:22:47,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead and open up the Skype line right now if you want to call into the show.

998
01:22:47,498 --> 01:22:53,021
[SPEAKER_09]: If you are curious about how you use the Skype line, head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com.

999
01:22:53,341 --> 01:22:57,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Click on Interact With Us, and that will show you how you can interact with the show.

1000
01:22:57,363 --> 01:22:58,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I've got to warn you guys, though.

1001
01:22:58,963 --> 01:23:04,566
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there might be some issues with the Skype line tonight, so we're going to kind of play it on the fly.

1002
01:23:04,966 --> 01:23:10,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I did make some changes to my computer this week, I think there might be some echoes when you guys are talking on Skype.

1003
01:23:11,289 --> 01:23:12,669
[SPEAKER_09]: And if there is, I apologize.

1004
01:23:12,749 --> 01:23:13,830
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll just see what happens.

1005
01:23:14,810 --> 01:23:17,191
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just going to wing it and try taking a call and see what happens.

1006
01:23:17,231 --> 01:23:18,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1007
01:23:19,491 --> 01:23:20,752
[SPEAKER_23]: It's me, Legend of Zaku.

1008
01:23:21,132 --> 01:23:23,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, it's me, Legend of Zaku.

1009
01:23:23,072 --> 01:23:23,532
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you?

1010
01:23:24,413 --> 01:23:24,793
[SPEAKER_23]: Fine.

1011
01:23:26,153 --> 01:23:26,773
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know.

1012
01:23:26,933 --> 01:23:30,134
[SPEAKER_23]: In two days, we're about to see the new Dancing Stage Fusion.

1013
01:23:30,194 --> 01:23:33,455
[SPEAKER_23]: So I wonder how big is the coverage on that going to be?

1014
01:23:33,475 --> 01:23:36,956
[SPEAKER_23]: Because we're going to find out this new hardware and everything about it.

1015
01:23:37,364 --> 01:23:40,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Dancing Stage Fusion... Well, you know, very good point you're bringing up.

1016
01:23:40,485 --> 01:23:43,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Dancing Stage Fusion is supposedly going to be out this week.

1017
01:23:44,226 --> 01:23:47,808
[SPEAKER_09]: So, or we're supposed to... No, it's not that it's out, but we get to see it at some extra.

1018
01:23:47,828 --> 01:23:48,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Two more days.

1019
01:23:48,928 --> 01:23:52,689
[SPEAKER_23]: Tuesday should be... It's going to be debuted on Tuesday in London.

1020
01:23:52,969 --> 01:23:54,610
[SPEAKER_23]: Right, it's going to be at that show, right?

1021
01:23:55,447 --> 01:24:01,851
[SPEAKER_23]: I was just checking out the boards, I mean, I was just checking out the Freak right there, and there's only like a few people that are actually going.

1022
01:24:02,391 --> 01:24:05,633
[SPEAKER_23]: I know one of the mods basically couldn't go that day, but, you know, that's about it.

1023
01:24:05,653 --> 01:24:10,035
[SPEAKER_23]: You know what... I don't know if it's coverage-wise, how... Here's how it works, though, Zaku, seriously.

1024
01:24:10,376 --> 01:24:17,300
[SPEAKER_09]: If one person goes, and one person goes, and one person takes a camera with them, that's all it takes for this to get all over the internet.

1025
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:19,561
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know some of the big gaming sites are going to be there.

1026
01:24:20,561 --> 01:24:21,082
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say...

1027
01:24:22,963 --> 01:24:25,804
[SPEAKER_23]: I doubt Mist and DDRUK would know.

1028
01:24:26,384 --> 01:24:31,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, DDRUK is in a bit of trouble right now.

1029
01:24:31,506 --> 01:24:34,667
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to say you're not going to hear anything from them because I really don't know.

1030
01:24:34,727 --> 01:24:35,508
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't run that site.

1031
01:24:35,548 --> 01:24:36,488
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what they've got planned.

1032
01:24:36,508 --> 01:24:38,989
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know if Mist is going to send people from his site.

1033
01:24:39,893 --> 01:24:43,455
[SPEAKER_23]: and post on the Freak, but we'll just wait and see.

1034
01:24:44,175 --> 01:24:48,797
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hoping, you know what, DDR Freak is usually the hub of all the DDR information.

1035
01:24:49,257 --> 01:24:54,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if it gets posted to another site, like Aaron in Japan usually has a lot of news breaks over there.

1036
01:24:55,020 --> 01:24:58,301
[SPEAKER_09]: If they break it, it's going to be posted on DDR Freak.

1037
01:24:58,361 --> 01:24:59,622
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the beauty of the internet.

1038
01:24:59,762 --> 01:25:02,763
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the information superhighway and we all share the information.

1039
01:25:03,323 --> 01:25:06,505
[SPEAKER_09]: You will not be left out in the cold with the information, Zaku.

1040
01:25:06,985 --> 01:25:09,246
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything we find out, Zaku, I assure you we'll bring you.

1041
01:25:09,971 --> 01:25:12,892
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, that's cool.

1042
01:25:13,212 --> 01:25:13,773
[SPEAKER_23]: Let me see.

1043
01:25:14,293 --> 01:25:15,013
[SPEAKER_23]: Anything else?

1044
01:25:15,653 --> 01:25:22,796
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, I got money for buying 2DX products and basically starting to get into that thing.

1045
01:25:22,836 --> 01:25:28,258
[SPEAKER_23]: I just need a great deal on a 2DX controller and at least one style that could be affordable.

1046
01:25:28,698 --> 01:25:30,098
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm going to spend about $100.

1047
01:25:30,358 --> 01:25:31,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me poll the chat room right now.

1048
01:25:32,219 --> 01:25:34,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Most affordable 2DX controller you've seen lately?

1049
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:36,161
[SPEAKER_19]: None of them.

1050
01:25:38,007 --> 01:25:40,088
[SPEAKER_19]: Whatever you do, don't buy the triangular looking one.

1051
01:25:40,208 --> 01:25:41,469
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, don't buy the cheap one.

1052
01:25:41,509 --> 01:25:42,009
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what?

1053
01:25:42,029 --> 01:25:42,550
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what?

1054
01:25:43,690 --> 01:25:45,551
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't buy anything but the official stuff.

1055
01:25:46,212 --> 01:25:47,753
[SPEAKER_19]: You'll be wasting your money otherwise.

1056
01:25:48,793 --> 01:25:49,954
[SPEAKER_19]: You get what you pay for.

1057
01:25:50,034 --> 01:25:51,615
[SPEAKER_19]: If you pay for cheap, you get cheap.

1058
01:25:51,895 --> 01:25:53,196
[SPEAKER_19]: And it breaks in five days.

1059
01:25:55,314 --> 01:25:56,895
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not getting the Rave Discman.

1060
01:25:56,955 --> 01:25:58,996
[SPEAKER_23]: I know that I'm not getting the Rave Discman.

1061
01:25:59,016 --> 01:26:02,559
[SPEAKER_23]: There's no way I'm getting the damn Rave Discman.

1062
01:26:02,599 --> 01:26:03,840
[SPEAKER_19]: Just buy a real controller.

1063
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:05,081
[SPEAKER_19]: Go to Toys and Joys.

1064
01:26:05,221 --> 01:26:06,142
[SPEAKER_19]: What the?

1065
01:26:06,342 --> 01:26:09,245
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know how they still charge different prices depending on the size.

1066
01:26:09,325 --> 01:26:11,066
[SPEAKER_23]: I know, but you know, they're 80 bucks.

1067
01:26:12,647 --> 01:26:14,809
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how much these puppies cost.

1068
01:26:14,849 --> 01:26:16,670
[SPEAKER_19]: That's cheaper than what I paid for mine.

1069
01:26:16,690 --> 01:26:17,891
[SPEAKER_19]: Shipping's like 40 bucks.

1070
01:26:18,632 --> 01:26:20,273
[SPEAKER_19]: I paid 120 for mine.

1071
01:26:20,894 --> 01:26:22,275
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't complain about 80 dollars.

1072
01:26:23,924 --> 01:26:27,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, all I can say, shop around, Zaku.

1073
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:29,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Go to Toys and Joys, Hameya.

1074
01:26:29,971 --> 01:26:31,834
[SPEAKER_19]: But never order from Byright.

1075
01:26:32,014 --> 01:26:36,679
[SPEAKER_19]: Never, ever, ever, ever order from Byright because they will screw you.

1076
01:26:37,821 --> 01:26:38,481
[SPEAKER_09]: Without lube.

1077
01:26:39,062 --> 01:26:40,043
[SPEAKER_19]: It will be painful.

1078
01:26:41,044 --> 01:26:42,526
[SPEAKER_09]: Shop around, Zaku.

1079
01:26:42,546 --> 01:26:43,247
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the best you can do.

1080
01:26:44,672 --> 01:26:46,393
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, bud, I'm going to let you go so we can take another call.

1081
01:26:46,593 --> 01:26:47,494
[SPEAKER_09]: But thanks for calling in, as always.

1082
01:26:47,514 --> 01:26:48,354
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, thanks a lot, man.

1083
01:26:48,394 --> 01:26:48,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care, Zach.

1084
01:26:49,755 --> 01:26:50,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to the next call.

1085
01:26:50,776 --> 01:26:52,317
[SPEAKER_09]: I see another line ringing here.

1086
01:26:52,657 --> 01:26:55,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

1087
01:26:56,299 --> 01:26:56,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, what's up?

1088
01:26:56,879 --> 01:26:58,840
[SPEAKER_09]: This is DJ Ranma S from the East Coast.

1089
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:00,801
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a box full of snow for you guys.

1090
01:27:01,081 --> 01:27:04,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, hooray, snow, because we don't get that here, seriously.

1091
01:27:05,264 --> 01:27:06,064
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of figured.

1092
01:27:06,525 --> 01:27:07,705
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind, Ranma S?

1093
01:27:09,046 --> 01:27:09,766
[SPEAKER_09]: Ranma.

1094
01:27:10,107 --> 01:27:10,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Ranma.

1095
01:27:12,541 --> 01:27:16,742
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know, if you wanted to be literal, you could just call him Wild Horse S, because that's what Ranma means.

1096
01:27:16,762 --> 01:27:17,703
[SPEAKER_09]: How about Ranmask?

1097
01:27:17,743 --> 01:27:19,243
[SPEAKER_09]: You want me to start calling you Ranmask?

1098
01:27:20,183 --> 01:27:22,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, Sky, you can call me whatever you like.

1099
01:27:22,324 --> 01:27:23,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Call me through the phone.

1100
01:27:24,004 --> 01:27:24,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, George.

1101
01:27:25,105 --> 01:27:25,245
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1102
01:27:25,585 --> 01:27:26,185
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind?

1103
01:27:27,005 --> 01:27:28,766
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't much want to know how you guys are doing over there.

1104
01:27:28,806 --> 01:27:30,906
[SPEAKER_06]: I want some of that warm weather, because I'm freezing here.

1105
01:27:31,246 --> 01:27:33,627
[SPEAKER_09]: We will put some warm weather in a box and send it to you.

1106
01:27:33,747 --> 01:27:34,287
[SPEAKER_09]: How does that sound?

1107
01:27:35,147 --> 01:27:35,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Even trade?

1108
01:27:36,428 --> 01:27:36,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, why not?

1109
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:38,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, that works for me, boys.

1110
01:27:38,979 --> 01:27:39,999
[SPEAKER_06]: That works great for me.

1111
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:42,180
[SPEAKER_09]: What's going on on the East Coast scene right now?

1112
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:43,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, not much.

1113
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:46,261
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been... Everybody's just dealing with the snow.

1114
01:27:46,281 --> 01:27:48,601
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, we got like two feet over here.

1115
01:27:48,641 --> 01:27:50,382
[SPEAKER_06]: People complaining about the weather, you know.

1116
01:27:51,162 --> 01:27:51,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Work sucks.

1117
01:27:51,942 --> 01:27:55,323
[SPEAKER_06]: People complain that we closed early yesterday, but we were in the middle of a snowstorm.

1118
01:27:55,343 --> 01:27:56,203
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you expect us to do?

1119
01:27:56,503 --> 01:28:00,404
[SPEAKER_09]: I could not imagine anything closing due to snow.

1120
01:28:01,064 --> 01:28:02,624
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm spoiled by California.

1121
01:28:02,644 --> 01:28:03,104
[SPEAKER_09]: What can I say?

1122
01:28:04,484 --> 01:28:07,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Right or not, I would love to be in California for about a good two weeks.

1123
01:28:07,926 --> 01:28:18,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, didn't you come out here for the expo, or am I getting my... No, no, no, no, I'm not coming out for Anime Expo, but I am coming out there for Anime Vegas sometime in September.

1124
01:28:18,475 --> 01:28:19,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, I want to go to Vegas.

1125
01:28:19,595 --> 01:28:21,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever you do, never go to AX, because it sucks.

1126
01:28:22,378 --> 01:28:23,779
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to Anime this year.

1127
01:28:24,559 --> 01:28:26,121
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no plans to go to AX.

1128
01:28:26,761 --> 01:28:32,025
[SPEAKER_06]: I sent some friends of mine out there from the Econ Reports, they said it sucked, so I have no plans to go.

1129
01:28:32,826 --> 01:28:35,688
[SPEAKER_19]: Someone, I was cosplaying Mad Hatter.

1130
01:28:36,297 --> 01:28:38,738
[SPEAKER_19]: I said, did you snap their neck or send somebody after them to hurt them?

1131
01:28:39,038 --> 01:28:42,779
[SPEAKER_19]: I still didn't hear Did you snap their neck or send somebody after them to hurt them?

1132
01:29:06,353 --> 01:29:09,375
[SPEAKER_19]: I did step on somebody's foot in the 4-inch boots.

1133
01:29:10,296 --> 01:29:11,036
[SPEAKER_06]: That works for me.

1134
01:29:11,116 --> 01:29:11,636
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

1135
01:29:12,817 --> 01:29:13,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else on your mind?

1136
01:29:14,578 --> 01:29:15,178
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's it.

1137
01:29:15,198 --> 01:29:16,539
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to hear you guys.

1138
01:29:16,559 --> 01:29:17,400
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all, basically.

1139
01:29:17,420 --> 01:29:18,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Love the show.

1140
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:20,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Thoughts on DDR Mario, real quick.

1141
01:29:22,003 --> 01:29:24,244
[SPEAKER_06]: I already have it pre-reserved at my store.

1142
01:29:24,824 --> 01:29:25,625
[SPEAKER_09]: Then there you have it.

1143
01:29:25,765 --> 01:29:26,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, thanks for calling.

1144
01:29:28,246 --> 01:29:28,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Laters.

1145
01:29:28,747 --> 01:29:29,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good one, buddy.

1146
01:29:30,407 --> 01:29:31,608
[SPEAKER_09]: We're hearing from all sorts of people.

1147
01:29:31,628 --> 01:29:33,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do one more call, then we'll get to the cage match.

1148
01:29:33,429 --> 01:29:34,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1149
01:29:35,478 --> 01:29:36,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey Sky, it's El Mullet.

1150
01:29:36,939 --> 01:29:38,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello El Mullet!

1151
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:39,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello Sky!

1152
01:29:39,820 --> 01:29:42,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, he with my favorite nickname on the internet.

1153
01:29:42,082 --> 01:29:42,482
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up?

1154
01:29:44,383 --> 01:29:45,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Today's a pretty big day for me.

1155
01:29:46,084 --> 01:29:47,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to move back into school.

1156
01:29:47,564 --> 01:29:48,825
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in the dorm room right now.

1157
01:29:49,546 --> 01:29:50,506
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, dorm life.

1158
01:29:50,626 --> 01:29:51,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Duh, duh, duh.

1159
01:29:51,987 --> 01:29:52,867
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, man.

1160
01:29:53,428 --> 01:29:53,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1161
01:29:53,868 --> 01:29:55,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Bad internet connections and all.

1162
01:29:55,649 --> 01:29:56,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Quick poll in the studio.

1163
01:29:56,809 --> 01:29:58,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Who here has lived in a college dorm?

1164
01:29:59,591 --> 01:30:00,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Just me and Jamie?

1165
01:30:01,272 --> 01:30:01,652
[SPEAKER_21]: That's it?

1166
01:30:02,017 --> 01:30:02,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, oh my god.

1167
01:30:03,057 --> 01:30:03,718
[SPEAKER_09]: College dorm life.

1168
01:30:03,738 --> 01:30:05,278
[SPEAKER_21]: Living in the dorm was the best.

1169
01:30:05,558 --> 01:30:07,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Living in the dorm was horrible, horrible, horrible.

1170
01:30:07,999 --> 01:30:09,259
[SPEAKER_09]: I would never wish that upon anybody.

1171
01:30:09,639 --> 01:30:17,122
[SPEAKER_19]: My dorm was so awesome because, first of all, our person who watched us never really cared what we did.

1172
01:30:17,582 --> 01:30:18,702
[SPEAKER_19]: So my friend had durables.

1173
01:30:19,022 --> 01:30:19,983
[SPEAKER_19]: They were the VCRs.

1174
01:30:21,823 --> 01:30:30,506
[SPEAKER_19]: And then I also lived within walking distance of a bar slash deli slash arcade that would get imports and pirate kits.

1175
01:30:31,434 --> 01:30:32,015
[SPEAKER_19]: All the time.

1176
01:30:33,136 --> 01:30:34,658
[SPEAKER_19]: And they were open 24 hours.

1177
01:30:35,519 --> 01:30:36,019
[SPEAKER_09]: Dang.

1178
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:37,301
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty nice.

1179
01:30:38,302 --> 01:30:43,608
[SPEAKER_09]: The only good thing about living in the dorms for me was that I was the only one that had a Super Nintendo.

1180
01:30:44,089 --> 01:30:46,712
[SPEAKER_09]: So all the boys would come over and play Mario Kart.

1181
01:30:47,205 --> 01:30:51,027
[SPEAKER_19]: My roommate actually had a Playstation when it came out and I had a TV and she didn't.

1182
01:30:51,447 --> 01:30:53,648
[SPEAKER_19]: So we had it hooked up at a VCR.

1183
01:30:53,688 --> 01:30:55,548
[SPEAKER_19]: I would skip my witchcraft class.

1184
01:30:56,249 --> 01:30:57,269
[SPEAKER_19]: I took History of Witchcraft.

1185
01:30:57,569 --> 01:30:58,009
[SPEAKER_09]: I did too.

1186
01:30:58,469 --> 01:30:59,710
[SPEAKER_19]: To watch Sailor Moon.

1187
01:31:00,650 --> 01:31:02,391
[SPEAKER_19]: It just dates when I lived in the dorms.

1188
01:31:02,935 --> 01:31:07,339
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you're guaranteed college popularity if you have something very obscure.

1189
01:31:07,939 --> 01:31:11,262
[SPEAKER_09]: See, I didn't quite get to the second half of my story.

1190
01:31:11,322 --> 01:31:19,609
[SPEAKER_09]: See, I was popular when I had the Super Nintendo, but then when the upstairs guys got the Nintendo 64, nobody loved Rob anymore.

1191
01:31:20,029 --> 01:31:21,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody loved Rob anymore.

1192
01:31:22,931 --> 01:31:27,055
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, the other thing that was cool about me living on campus is I had a job on campus.

1193
01:31:27,575 --> 01:31:29,457
[SPEAKER_19]: I worked in our pool hall slash arcade.

1194
01:31:30,257 --> 01:31:30,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's cool.

1195
01:31:31,352 --> 01:31:35,835
[SPEAKER_19]: and I ran our tournaments and my first time playing a Saturn was playing Japanese games.

1196
01:31:36,135 --> 01:31:36,876
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1197
01:31:37,436 --> 01:31:40,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Our college built an arcade the year after I left.

1198
01:31:41,299 --> 01:31:41,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Those cocks.

1199
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:42,820
[SPEAKER_22]: Sucky.

1200
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:43,341
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

1201
01:31:43,641 --> 01:31:45,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, I'm sorry, Elmo, we got sidetracked.

1202
01:31:45,302 --> 01:31:46,763
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you call in to talk to us about tonight?

1203
01:31:47,483 --> 01:31:50,446
[SPEAKER_09]: I called to talk about various things.

1204
01:31:50,786 --> 01:31:51,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1205
01:31:52,227 --> 01:31:53,888
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR Mario, for example.

1206
01:31:53,948 --> 01:31:55,209
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really looking forward to it.

1207
01:31:56,330 --> 01:31:58,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I want to know your thoughts on DDR Mario.

1208
01:31:59,178 --> 01:32:06,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, first of all, considering it's a joint project between Konami and Nintendo, I mean, how can that possibly go wrong?

1209
01:32:07,962 --> 01:32:14,545
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, I'm just a giddy little fanboy thinking about the possibilities when Konami and Nintendo join forces.

1210
01:32:14,665 --> 01:32:15,885
[SPEAKER_09]: This game's going to rock.

1211
01:32:16,265 --> 01:32:20,207
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be really nauseously cute, but it's going to rock.

1212
01:32:20,971 --> 01:32:22,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, wait a minute, I'm a Nintendo fanboy!

1213
01:32:50,681 --> 01:32:53,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Any wishes, things you want to see in DDR Mario?

1214
01:32:54,523 --> 01:33:01,525
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see a crapload of Konami original remixes of Nintendo songs.

1215
01:33:01,545 --> 01:33:02,305
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be incredible.

1216
01:33:02,325 --> 01:33:03,325
[SPEAKER_09]: I need lots of Taku.

1217
01:33:14,685 --> 01:33:16,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Jamie wants Taku to come over and remix and stuff.

1218
01:33:16,887 --> 01:33:20,410
[SPEAKER_19]: Imagine Taku doing, like, the dungeon one from the first Super Mario Bros.

1219
01:33:20,550 --> 01:33:24,854
[SPEAKER_19]: Seriously, could you imagine it?

1220
01:33:25,474 --> 01:33:26,175
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be pretty hot.

1221
01:33:26,635 --> 01:33:31,159
[SPEAKER_04]: If I had one wish, I want a dance remix of the Zelda 2 dungeon theme.

1222
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:40,327
[SPEAKER_44]: Oh, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-

1223
01:33:44,474 --> 01:33:46,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and then we have a comment in the chat room.

1224
01:33:46,474 --> 01:33:50,095
[SPEAKER_09]: Miklatov, Akira Yamaoka better fucking be in it remixing anything.

1225
01:33:51,035 --> 01:33:51,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Amen to that.

1226
01:33:51,415 --> 01:33:54,296
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a great Mario happy joy go lucky mix.

1227
01:33:54,316 --> 01:33:55,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Winner is you.

1228
01:33:55,376 --> 01:34:00,337
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, seriously, if he can do like Bitmania and all that stuff, imagine him remixing like a Mario theme.

1229
01:34:01,177 --> 01:34:01,937
[SPEAKER_09]: I just got a boner.

1230
01:34:02,377 --> 01:34:02,677
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

1231
01:34:03,497 --> 01:34:03,697
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

1232
01:34:03,857 --> 01:34:04,237
[SPEAKER_19]: Kidding.

1233
01:34:04,377 --> 01:34:04,697
[SPEAKER_19]: Kidding.

1234
01:34:04,757 --> 01:34:08,398
[SPEAKER_19]: No, Akira Yamaoka remixing music from Luigi's Mansion.

1235
01:34:10,198 --> 01:34:11,979
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we want music that people have actually heard.

1236
01:34:13,059 --> 01:34:13,339
What?

1237
01:34:14,858 --> 01:34:18,139
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you think Luigi's Mansion was kind of fun, spooky?

1238
01:34:18,199 --> 01:34:19,639
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, but the game was kind of not.

1239
01:34:19,659 --> 01:34:20,600
[SPEAKER_19]: The game was cute.

1240
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:24,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Luigi's Mansion was a great YouTube tech demo.

1241
01:34:25,161 --> 01:34:25,981
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty much it.

1242
01:34:26,001 --> 01:34:28,842
[SPEAKER_04]: If it came with the system, it would have been a hell of a lot better.

1243
01:34:29,022 --> 01:34:31,102
[SPEAKER_04]: But we had to pay $50 for it, so.

1244
01:34:32,483 --> 01:34:35,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Personally, I think it sucked.

1245
01:34:36,184 --> 01:34:36,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it?

1246
01:34:37,539 --> 01:34:40,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Luigi had a vacuum.

1247
01:34:41,463 --> 01:34:43,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, why did I call him?

1248
01:34:43,525 --> 01:34:44,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Loser!

1249
01:34:45,968 --> 01:34:51,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, any other thoughts on your mind, Elmullet, on this lovely Sunday evening?

1250
01:34:51,653 --> 01:34:52,854
[SPEAKER_03]: There are many, many thoughts.

1251
01:34:52,954 --> 01:34:54,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Which one would you like me to share?

1252
01:34:55,137 --> 01:34:55,697
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1253
01:34:56,898 --> 01:34:57,539
[SPEAKER_04]: The third one.

1254
01:34:58,325 --> 01:34:59,185
[SPEAKER_04]: The third one?

1255
01:35:00,286 --> 01:35:00,846
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1256
01:35:00,906 --> 01:35:01,966
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little risque.

1257
01:35:02,867 --> 01:35:05,548
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll just skip to the fourth one and chill out my side again.

1258
01:35:06,968 --> 01:35:07,148
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1259
01:35:07,168 --> 01:35:07,449
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1260
01:35:07,489 --> 01:35:07,849
[SPEAKER_09]: I missed that.

1261
01:35:08,569 --> 01:35:10,910
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just skip to the fourth one and chill out my side again.

1262
01:35:11,490 --> 01:35:11,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1263
01:35:12,090 --> 01:35:12,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

1264
01:35:12,510 --> 01:35:12,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Go for it.

1265
01:35:13,851 --> 01:35:20,594
[SPEAKER_04]: www.insidepulse.com Go to the game section and read me specifically and other people because they're awesome.

1266
01:35:21,594 --> 01:35:25,015
[SPEAKER_09]: We only let him whore out that because he whores us out all the time.

1267
01:35:25,615 --> 01:35:26,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week.

1268
01:35:26,756 --> 01:35:26,976
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

1269
01:35:27,438 --> 01:35:28,859
[SPEAKER_09]: We appreciate the whoring out, buddy.

1270
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:30,140
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.

1271
01:35:30,220 --> 01:35:35,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we're looking forward to more information on DDR Mario showing up on Inside Pulse as it comes out.

1272
01:35:35,644 --> 01:35:35,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1273
01:35:36,064 --> 01:35:36,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, take care, bud.

1274
01:35:37,866 --> 01:35:38,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

1275
01:35:38,446 --> 01:35:38,726
[SPEAKER_09]: Later.

1276
01:35:39,527 --> 01:35:40,968
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura has an announcement.

1277
01:35:41,368 --> 01:35:41,969
[SPEAKER_19]: In local news.

1278
01:35:42,629 --> 01:35:43,350
[SPEAKER_09]: In local news.

1279
01:35:44,411 --> 01:35:47,593
[SPEAKER_19]: I put the final nail in the coffin on Sackbimani today.

1280
01:35:49,134 --> 01:35:51,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Aww, Sackbimani is dead and gone and is no more.

1281
01:35:51,776 --> 01:35:54,038
[SPEAKER_19]: Is making way for Deathcake.com.

1282
01:35:56,491 --> 01:35:59,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Since you're not going to say it anymore, Addict!

1283
01:36:00,514 --> 01:36:01,555
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know we love you.

1284
01:36:01,975 --> 01:36:03,977
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not doing this for myself, I'm doing it for you guys.

1285
01:36:04,257 --> 01:36:04,537
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

1286
01:36:04,578 --> 01:36:09,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'm still probably not going to play more than a couple... It's group addiction therapy for you.

1287
01:36:10,983 --> 01:36:12,624
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm still going to be too busy with school.

1288
01:36:12,644 --> 01:36:13,865
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, it's all good.

1289
01:36:15,137 --> 01:36:18,859
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we're going to... Is that all you wanted to say about... You know what, though?

1290
01:36:18,979 --> 01:36:24,261
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta say, though, it is kind of sad to see Sakpamani go bye-bye, because it was kind of, you know... Not my fault it died.

1291
01:36:24,482 --> 01:36:25,262
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, I know.

1292
01:36:25,322 --> 01:36:42,010
[SPEAKER_09]: It was kind of the way we all got to know each other, and I think LiveJournal kind of... Not everyone would rather post in the crappy RBGL thread on... Well, the cool thing about the Sakpamani forums was that they had, like, the masturbation thread and things like that, and now people use their LiveJournals for that stuff, so... Still have a community.

1293
01:36:42,728 --> 01:36:45,429
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, I'm going to go start a masturbation thread on my life journal right now.

1294
01:36:47,189 --> 01:36:49,030
[SPEAKER_19]: I can post it on my life journal right now.

1295
01:36:49,050 --> 01:36:49,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Just kidding.

1296
01:36:50,530 --> 01:36:51,011
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kidding.

1297
01:36:51,031 --> 01:36:51,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Gross.

1298
01:36:52,691 --> 01:36:54,091
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, wait a minute.

1299
01:36:54,191 --> 01:36:54,672
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm hot.

1300
01:36:57,552 --> 01:37:00,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, if you get defriended by me in the next couple of days, you know why.

1301
01:37:04,535 --> 01:37:06,015
[SPEAKER_19]: You need to play with the mouse a little bit.

1302
01:37:07,195 --> 01:37:07,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait a minute.

1303
01:37:07,696 --> 01:37:09,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Is Jamie telling Brad to click the mouse over there?

1304
01:37:09,776 --> 01:37:11,497
[SPEAKER_17]: No, but we do need to be focused on the chat room.

1305
01:37:12,357 --> 01:37:12,617
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1306
01:37:13,047 --> 01:37:16,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, let's get to the Orange Lounge Radio cage match, shall we?

1307
01:37:18,011 --> 01:37:22,974
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though I'm totally not ready to do the cage match tonight.

1308
01:37:24,595 --> 01:37:27,557
[SPEAKER_09]: I need some more time filler here while I set up for cage match.

1309
01:37:27,597 --> 01:37:27,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Help!

1310
01:37:32,241 --> 01:37:33,662
[SPEAKER_09]: What is going on over there in the kitchen?

1311
01:37:36,183 --> 01:37:37,344
[SPEAKER_09]: They're having an orgy in the kitchen.

1312
01:37:41,547 --> 01:37:42,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, boy.

1313
01:37:42,148 --> 01:37:42,568
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1314
01:37:46,256 --> 01:37:49,798
[SPEAKER_09]: The Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match Boys and Girls

1315
01:38:07,569 --> 01:38:08,930
[SPEAKER_09]: and you can make a vote, okay?

1316
01:38:09,470 --> 01:38:18,954
[SPEAKER_09]: The winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music & More program which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on this station when we're not live.

1317
01:38:19,314 --> 01:38:21,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so it's your chance to pick a song.

1318
01:38:22,056 --> 01:38:25,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, first off, you get to hear a clip of last week's winner.

1319
01:38:25,257 --> 01:38:30,159
[SPEAKER_09]: You only get to hear a clip because it was the winner, so you already heard it because you listen to the show every week, right?

1320
01:38:30,680 --> 01:38:31,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, here it is.

1321
01:38:31,901 --> 01:38:33,022
[SPEAKER_09]: A clip of song number one.

1322
01:38:33,082 --> 01:38:37,023
[SPEAKER_09]: And remember guys, you cannot vote until all three songs have played in their entirety.

1323
01:38:37,043 --> 01:38:38,443
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we'll tell you how to vote in the chat.

1324
01:38:38,744 --> 01:38:39,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, here it is.

1325
01:38:39,624 --> 01:38:42,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Last week in the Orange Lounge Cage Match, we had a brand new winner.

1326
01:38:42,385 --> 01:38:44,466
[SPEAKER_09]: An old favorite, Echo Image.

1327
01:38:44,826 --> 01:38:47,927
[SPEAKER_09]: And here it is, song number one, Echo Image with Endless Day.

1328
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:26,288
DarkSakura

1329
01:40:40,366 --> 01:40:44,530
They used to make much sense, but I was wrong

1330
01:41:00,757 --> 01:41:05,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Challenger number one comes to us from DarkSakura, and you get to hear these songs in their entirety.

1331
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:07,541
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, what's challenger number one tonight?

1332
01:41:07,642 --> 01:41:09,923
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, it's DJ Bobo, I believe.

1333
01:41:11,024 --> 01:41:17,208
[SPEAKER_19]: I was at Tapioca Express last night, and they put in a DVD, and this song was on it, and the video was just really awesome.

1334
01:41:17,868 --> 01:41:23,392
[SPEAKER_19]: And I instantly fell for this song, so I at least have an opportunity now to share it with everybody.

1335
01:41:24,232 --> 01:41:24,532
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1336
01:41:25,333 --> 01:41:25,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else?

1337
01:41:26,334 --> 01:41:26,514
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

1338
01:41:26,534 --> 01:41:26,914
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1339
01:41:27,349 --> 01:41:29,090
[SPEAKER_19]: Does there have to always be something?

1340
01:41:29,370 --> 01:41:31,290
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but I just liked your description of the video.

1341
01:41:31,970 --> 01:41:53,077
[SPEAKER_19]: The video was, okay, the video had this one guy getting onto a subway car, and there was, you know, just people of all types sitting around, just minding their own business, being singular, and then he starts handing out beer to everybody, to a nun, to this old man, to this kid, and also to everyone's own, oh, we're unified and we like beer.

1342
01:41:54,557 --> 01:41:54,977
[SPEAKER_19]: Singing.

1343
01:41:55,558 --> 01:41:56,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool.

1344
01:41:56,078 --> 01:41:56,478
[SPEAKER_19]: Over beer.

1345
01:41:57,168 --> 01:41:58,569
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1346
01:42:17,717 --> 01:42:19,118
[SPEAKER_09]: The orgy's going somewhere else.

1347
01:42:19,138 --> 01:42:19,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thanks for coming.

1348
01:42:19,718 --> 01:42:20,958
[SPEAKER_16]: We're relocating to the wild.

1349
01:42:21,238 --> 01:42:24,720
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's amazingly funny that we have the longest drive of all, and we're staying to the end.

1350
01:42:24,820 --> 01:42:25,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you're troopers.

1351
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:30,582
[SPEAKER_09]: You're real fans, Shark Skrull, Mel B. We are hardcore like the Peach Pits.

1352
01:42:31,783 --> 01:42:33,604
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, let's get to Jamie's song.

1353
01:42:33,644 --> 01:42:33,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Here it is.

1354
01:42:34,324 --> 01:42:37,265
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Bobo with... I Believe.

1355
01:42:37,425 --> 01:42:37,825
[SPEAKER_09]: I Believe.

1356
01:42:37,845 --> 01:42:38,946
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Bobo, I Believe.

1357
01:42:38,986 --> 01:42:40,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Song number two in tonight's cage match.

1358
01:42:40,246 --> 01:42:40,486
[SPEAKER_09]: Enjoy.

1359
01:42:51,523 --> 01:42:52,683
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on, small glitch there.

1360
01:42:52,743 --> 01:42:53,244
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, guys.

1361
01:42:53,384 --> 01:42:55,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me start it over here.

1362
01:42:55,184 --> 01:42:55,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry about that.

1363
01:42:55,845 --> 01:42:57,185
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got to bring up the audio levels.

1364
01:42:57,225 --> 01:42:59,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Here it is, song number two, DJ Bobo, I Believe.

1365
01:43:07,090 --> 01:43:08,971
[SPEAKER_28]: I believe in magic

1366
01:43:17,883 --> 01:43:22,808
[SPEAKER_28]: I believe in freedom I believe in dreams I believe in

1367
01:43:51,991 --> 01:43:55,991
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm afraid we've placed our life in another piece

1368
01:44:37,903 --> 01:44:40,052
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for watching!

1369
01:45:38,897 --> 01:45:52,198
[SPEAKER_28]: I believe I believe my dream can be reality I believe my time on earth is destiny

1370
01:46:10,035 --> 01:46:14,538
I believe in love, I believe in magic, this is not enough, we are strong enough

1371
01:46:42,333 --> 01:46:43,093
[SPEAKER_09]: All righty, guys.

1372
01:46:43,113 --> 01:46:44,655
[SPEAKER_09]: That was song number two.

1373
01:46:44,675 --> 01:46:47,917
[SPEAKER_09]: That was DJ Bobo with I Believe.

1374
01:46:48,018 --> 01:46:49,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we believe in this song?

1375
01:46:50,019 --> 01:46:50,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's find out.

1376
01:46:50,620 --> 01:46:50,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie.

1377
01:46:51,140 --> 01:46:52,842
[SPEAKER_19]: I was just transfixed by this video.

1378
01:46:54,203 --> 01:46:57,166
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sitting there eating my tater tots and curry at CapEx.

1379
01:46:57,926 --> 01:46:59,027
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm like, ooh.

1380
01:46:59,448 --> 01:47:00,208
[SPEAKER_19]: So I give it a ten.

1381
01:47:01,029 --> 01:47:01,369
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1382
01:47:02,210 --> 01:47:02,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's got the mic?

1383
01:47:02,731 --> 01:47:03,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Shark Skrull.

1384
01:47:04,768 --> 01:47:05,649
[SPEAKER_16]: 8.395 from Shark Scroll.

1385
01:47:05,669 --> 01:47:06,009
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, Explicit.

1386
01:47:06,029 --> 01:47:06,730
[SPEAKER_16]: 8.5 from Explicit.

1387
01:47:06,990 --> 01:47:07,411
[SPEAKER_16]: Mel B.

1388
01:47:31,654 --> 01:47:36,775
[SPEAKER_35]: Um, kind of throws me back to like the late 90s type of club techno type stuff.

1389
01:47:37,175 --> 01:47:40,416
[SPEAKER_35]: Kind of sounds like No Mercy except a lot less whistled.

1390
01:47:41,236 --> 01:47:42,777
[SPEAKER_35]: Um, I'll give it a 7.92.

1391
01:47:43,917 --> 01:47:49,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, um, for me personally, I definitely agree.

1392
01:47:49,679 --> 01:47:51,439
[SPEAKER_09]: I was thinking the mid 90s thing as well.

1393
01:47:51,859 --> 01:47:54,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Like an inspirational, I can do anything.

1394
01:47:56,340 --> 01:47:58,002
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe I can fly like this.

1395
01:47:58,062 --> 01:47:58,362
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1396
01:47:58,402 --> 01:47:59,103
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like an inspirational.

1397
01:47:59,403 --> 01:48:06,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is why I'm thinking about Jamie describing the video a little bit before and I'm like, that totally goes against that song.

1398
01:48:07,171 --> 01:48:08,432
[SPEAKER_19]: No, it was about...

1399
01:48:10,003 --> 01:48:11,084
[SPEAKER_19]: It was like a unity thing.

1400
01:48:11,104 --> 01:48:11,784
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe in beer.

1401
01:48:11,824 --> 01:48:13,264
[SPEAKER_19]: Everybody getting together over beer.

1402
01:48:13,425 --> 01:48:17,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, I'm not supposed, we're not supposed to take the videos into account during these Caged Vegetables.

1403
01:48:17,286 --> 01:48:26,510
[SPEAKER_09]: So the song, Strictly Yourself, it was, I like the throwback aspect of it and it left me, it left me feeling hopeful and inspirational and making me want to pray.

1404
01:48:26,691 --> 01:48:28,731
[SPEAKER_09]: So I give it a 6.66.

1405
01:48:29,212 --> 01:48:30,532
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I gotta give it something higher than that.

1406
01:48:30,732 --> 01:48:31,353
[SPEAKER_09]: An 8.666.

1407
01:48:31,893 --> 01:48:36,215
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe I was bored, so I get the 7.

1408
01:48:39,167 --> 01:48:42,093
[SPEAKER_09]: You know he's got to have his lame pun or it's just not a show.

1409
01:48:42,594 --> 01:48:43,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, here we go.

1410
01:48:43,596 --> 01:48:45,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Song number three from Loki.

1411
01:48:47,049 --> 01:48:49,971
[SPEAKER_07]: I was gonna put in the girls remix.

1412
01:48:50,572 --> 01:48:58,057
[SPEAKER_07]: I was told in the chatroom to do it, I was told by Jamie to do it, but my judgment, you know, said no, that would be wrong.

1413
01:48:58,218 --> 01:48:59,579
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll do it next week if this doesn't win.

1414
01:48:59,859 --> 01:49:04,923
[SPEAKER_07]: This is, um, I don't know for how many of you out there have seen the Sin City trailer.

1415
01:49:05,603 --> 01:49:08,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, this is a song playing in the background, except that's the instrumental version.

1416
01:49:08,625 --> 01:49:11,668
[SPEAKER_07]: This is The Cells by a group called The Servant.

1417
01:49:13,609 --> 01:49:16,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, song number three, The Cells by The Servant.

1418
01:49:17,096 --> 01:49:42,715
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll all click when the mortgage clears All our fears will disappear Now you go to bed

1419
01:49:45,576 --> 01:49:46,957
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1420
01:50:13,275 --> 01:50:27,818
I look for each other in the TV screen The sun goes up and the sun goes down I drag myself into the sand All I do, all I do is dance with you Every day I'm at my dad's And my dad's got right there All I do, all I do

1421
01:50:47,236 --> 01:50:51,382
[SPEAKER_29]: on the back of a manky cat now in I go like a

1422
01:51:02,617 --> 01:51:18,320
[SPEAKER_39]: I watch them, watch me, I watch them too Across the street, across the room I dress myself like a charcoal sketch My eyes are brown and my hair's a mess They annoy me, they do employ me They could destroy me, they should enjoy me We Chinese are funny We look for each other in the TV screen

1423
01:51:37,288 --> 01:51:50,417
The sun goes up and the sun goes down, DarkSakura tells me to look down, All I do, all I wanna do is... Every day is not my day, Can I take a break from this?

1424
01:51:50,517 --> 01:51:51,538
All I do...

1425
01:52:04,885 --> 01:52:11,912
The sales I am at the moment will soon die, but I will be here

1426
01:52:31,798 --> 01:52:46,329
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, I'll still be here Just as I am at the moment We'll soon die But I won't be here Oh, I'll still be

1427
01:53:09,302 --> 01:53:10,224
Thanks for watching!

1428
01:54:12,741 --> 01:54:16,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, that was song number three, The Servant with the Cells.

1429
01:54:17,123 --> 01:54:20,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see if that was good cells or bad cells.

1430
01:54:20,864 --> 01:54:21,184
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie?

1431
01:54:21,784 --> 01:54:22,764
[SPEAKER_19]: Mitochondria.

1432
01:54:22,784 --> 01:54:23,985
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like parasites.

1433
01:54:24,585 --> 01:54:26,646
[SPEAKER_19]: Um... And...

1434
01:54:28,976 --> 01:54:30,477
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura.com

1435
01:54:49,790 --> 01:54:50,050
[SPEAKER_16]: 6.8 Mel B

1436
01:55:14,720 --> 01:55:17,381
[SPEAKER_35]: Um, it's quite a pretty good ambiance, actually.

1437
01:55:17,581 --> 01:55:24,902
[SPEAKER_35]: I mean, not something I would bump in my system or nothing like that, but it kind of has a very, kind of a dark theme to it, obviously.

1438
01:55:25,042 --> 01:55:29,063
[SPEAKER_35]: Kind of throws me to the, uh, Silent Hill 4 type, uh, music.

1439
01:55:29,123 --> 01:55:31,043
[SPEAKER_35]: I was digging it, actually.

1440
01:55:31,163 --> 01:55:39,325
[SPEAKER_35]: I'd give it a... But, although, when, you know, Loki was talking about Wildcard, I was expecting something wild, but it's all good.

1441
01:55:39,345 --> 01:55:40,585
[SPEAKER_35]: I'll give it an 8.12.

1442
01:55:41,285 --> 01:55:43,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, my thoughts, personally, um, I would say...

1443
01:55:46,134 --> 01:55:48,355
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the song, actually, quite a bit.

1444
01:55:48,375 --> 01:55:49,335
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd probably give it like an 8.

1445
01:55:50,136 --> 01:55:54,438
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just don't see it in an Orange Launch Radio cage match.

1446
01:55:54,558 --> 01:55:56,259
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't gel right.

1447
01:55:56,299 --> 01:55:57,100
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't click for me.

1448
01:55:58,220 --> 01:56:00,942
[SPEAKER_09]: So I give it a... I would have given that even less score.

1449
01:56:02,283 --> 01:56:04,084
[SPEAKER_09]: I give it like a 6.5.

1450
01:56:06,125 --> 01:56:08,086
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to see this with the trailer.

1451
01:56:08,386 --> 01:56:09,847
[SPEAKER_07]: It is goddamn sexy.

1452
01:56:09,927 --> 01:56:10,967
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I have to say.

1453
01:56:11,428 --> 01:56:11,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Because...

1454
01:56:12,358 --> 01:56:41,490
[SPEAKER_07]: now the instrumental version is going to be in the movie I think actually the guy's voice kind of takes away from the song because you missed all the cool guitar riffs but um I was looking hard for that instrumental version but I couldn't find it because the soundtrack's not out yet so but god damn it go see Sin City it's going to be fucking awesome coming out April 1st April 1st see Sin City the only movie you'll need to see the entire year screw Star Wars and King Kong this is the best movie ever

1455
01:56:42,748 --> 01:56:43,228
[SPEAKER_07]: and I give it a 10.

1456
01:56:45,529 --> 01:56:48,591
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, it's not up to us to decide, it's up to you to decide.

1457
01:56:48,611 --> 01:56:50,732
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to place your vote for one of these three songs.

1458
01:56:51,152 --> 01:56:53,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Song number one, Echo Image, Endless Day.

1459
01:57:03,338 --> 01:57:08,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Song number two is DJ Bobo with a song called I Believe.

1460
01:57:22,132 --> 01:57:26,113
[SPEAKER_09]: And song number three, The Servant, with a song called The Cells.

1461
01:57:34,215 --> 01:57:36,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Place vote now.

1462
01:57:36,535 --> 01:57:40,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

1463
01:57:40,096 --> 01:57:43,477
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you don't understand what I'm saying there, I'll type it in chat for you guys right now.

1464
01:57:44,397 --> 01:57:45,917
[SPEAKER_09]: OrangeNotesRadio.com, click on chat.

1465
01:57:46,277 --> 01:57:49,738
[SPEAKER_09]: In the meantime, Loki, how about that Sim scene?

1466
01:57:50,757 --> 01:57:51,679
[SPEAKER_07]: DDR UK was shut down

1467
01:57:59,605 --> 01:58:00,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Why it was shut down?

1468
01:58:00,646 --> 01:58:01,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Voluntarily.

1469
01:58:01,847 --> 01:58:03,669
[SPEAKER_07]: And here is why voluntarily.

1470
01:58:04,070 --> 01:58:15,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the UK equivalent of the RIAA came after them and says, Currently the site has been placed into a temporary state of closure.

1471
01:58:15,481 --> 01:58:23,409
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a direct response to communication from the IFPI in regards to a variety of links and files that were available from the site.

1472
01:58:23,829 --> 01:58:28,676
[SPEAKER_07]: No direct legal action is being raised and this action has been voluntarily undertaken.

1473
01:58:29,116 --> 01:58:31,419
[SPEAKER_07]: We hope for normal service to resume soon.

1474
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:34,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, there's a little bit more to go along with that.

1475
01:58:35,725 --> 01:58:38,208
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently this was posted in...

1476
01:58:39,623 --> 01:58:41,745
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1477
01:58:59,239 --> 01:59:02,341
[SPEAKER_07]: I do know, well, the site was taken down voluntarily.

1478
01:59:02,421 --> 01:59:03,802
[SPEAKER_07]: They haven't, you know, pressed charges.

1479
01:59:03,862 --> 01:59:08,484
[SPEAKER_07]: It's due to response for the official files that were on there.

1480
01:59:08,864 --> 01:59:12,046
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, obviously they got in trouble for that.

1481
01:59:12,866 --> 01:59:14,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's the link here?

1482
01:59:17,149 --> 01:59:17,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

1483
01:59:20,110 --> 01:59:21,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, there were some other interesting things on that.

1484
01:59:22,391 --> 01:59:24,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I wish I could really find this.

1485
01:59:26,533 --> 01:59:27,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Where is it?

1486
01:59:31,147 --> 01:59:36,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, it's basically they got the logs of everyone that downloaded that crap.

1487
01:59:36,873 --> 01:59:42,859
[SPEAKER_07]: So they don't know what exactly that's going to entail as far as all the people that downloaded this stuff.

1488
01:59:45,161 --> 01:59:47,063
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, whether they're going to get in trouble or whatnot.

1489
01:59:47,443 --> 01:59:49,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Lucky for me, I don't download off that site.

1490
01:59:49,225 --> 01:59:51,968
[SPEAKER_07]: At least none of the official stuff and not from there.

1491
01:59:53,149 --> 01:59:54,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Now the other thing though, which was interesting...

1492
01:59:56,356 --> 02:00:03,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and this is in regards to, um, but my style, they're talking about taking down their sim file, um, I think too.

1493
02:00:03,939 --> 02:00:04,339
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.

1494
02:00:04,799 --> 02:00:06,020
[SPEAKER_07]: I, no, that's not it.

1495
02:00:07,060 --> 02:00:11,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and basically, you know, the same reasons, oh, okay, here we go.

1496
02:00:11,542 --> 02:00:13,863
[SPEAKER_07]: The DDRUK legal proceedings fact.

1497
02:00:14,363 --> 02:00:15,443
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, what happened to the site?

1498
02:00:15,463 --> 02:00:21,866
[SPEAKER_07]: DDRUK was recently contacted by the IFPI regarding legally held music recordings being distributed on the site.

1499
02:00:22,026 --> 02:00:24,987
[SPEAKER_07]: The recordings in question were the official sim files from Konami's

1500
02:00:25,627 --> 02:00:26,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Dance Dance Revolution Game.

1501
02:00:27,028 --> 02:00:27,768
[SPEAKER_07]: How'd they find out?

1502
02:00:27,808 --> 02:00:29,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Officially, we do not know.

1503
02:00:30,270 --> 02:00:35,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Unofficially, the AFPI website allows anonymous reporting of copyright infringement.

1504
02:00:35,093 --> 02:00:44,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Since the downloads are only accessible by registered members, it is likely a DDRUK site member contacted the AFPI and gave them details of the files being stored.

1505
02:00:45,859 --> 02:00:48,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh, they must have banned somebody and they didn't like that.

1506
02:00:50,566 --> 02:00:52,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, what's going to happen to the site?

1507
02:00:52,187 --> 02:00:53,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now we do not know.

1508
02:00:53,367 --> 02:00:57,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Myst is currently unreachable and is currently in discussions.

1509
02:00:58,709 --> 02:01:02,530
[SPEAKER_07]: The site is down for the moment and is likely to remain that way until a later date.

1510
02:01:03,191 --> 02:01:04,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Currently unconfirmed.

1511
02:01:04,911 --> 02:01:07,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Is Myst facing a fine or jail time?

1512
02:01:07,952 --> 02:01:09,073
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the guy that runs the site.

1513
02:01:09,853 --> 02:01:13,515
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Myst has given full cooperation with the authorities.

1514
02:01:13,575 --> 02:01:14,615
[SPEAKER_07]: They have requested that...

1515
02:01:15,442 --> 02:01:16,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching.

1516
02:01:35,185 --> 02:01:36,747
[SPEAKER_07]: He is avoiding any punitive action.

1517
02:01:37,167 --> 02:01:38,508
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what will happen to the users.

1518
02:01:38,848 --> 02:01:43,352
[SPEAKER_07]: This we do not know, aside from the fact that Myst has complied with the request.

1519
02:01:43,772 --> 02:01:47,835
[SPEAKER_07]: We do not know what action, if any, the AFPI intend to take.

1520
02:01:49,056 --> 02:01:51,638
[SPEAKER_07]: And this will be updated as they know more.

1521
02:01:53,400 --> 02:01:57,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Comment from the chatroom, coming from Same, says that fact is fake.

1522
02:01:58,092 --> 02:02:03,813
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm sorry, but I tend to agree, because I wouldn't believe a goddamn thing I would read on the GameFAQs message boards.

1523
02:02:05,133 --> 02:02:05,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, whatever.

1524
02:02:05,673 --> 02:02:12,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, all we know... Well, here's the thing that also was suspicious of me, is the BitTorrent files, they aren't on that server.

1525
02:02:12,895 --> 02:02:18,796
[SPEAKER_07]: They're on DRAmerica.com, which also got shut down, but that's another thing entirely.

1526
02:02:19,536 --> 02:02:21,736
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is just a scare tactic, honestly.

1527
02:02:21,916 --> 02:02:24,037
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't... I mean, come on, people.

1528
02:02:24,617 --> 02:02:25,357
[SPEAKER_09]: It's freaking...

1529
02:02:26,061 --> 02:02:27,802
[SPEAKER_09]: DDR SIM files.

1530
02:02:28,162 --> 02:02:30,342
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not even often the full songs.

1531
02:02:30,402 --> 02:02:32,663
[SPEAKER_09]: They're little cut-down versions of these full songs.

1532
02:02:33,483 --> 02:02:42,987
[SPEAKER_09]: If they were really going to do lawsuits against the users of DDR UK, don't you think everybody that's ever used Supernova would be extremely fucked right about now?

1533
02:02:43,567 --> 02:02:47,608
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, seriously, you could have downloaded way more stuff.

1534
02:02:47,688 --> 02:02:49,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Full CDs off Supernova.

1535
02:02:49,409 --> 02:02:49,809
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.

1536
02:02:50,205 --> 02:02:54,106
[SPEAKER_19]: Some of us still download full CDs off of ByTorrent.com

1537
02:03:11,457 --> 02:03:20,955
[SPEAKER_31]: But even if they're trying to catch us or anything like that, we can always file back a counter-lawsuit for invading our privacy and stuff.

1538
02:03:22,978 --> 02:03:27,141
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why... I think you're more just getting into international messiness.

1539
02:03:27,161 --> 02:03:27,921
[SPEAKER_31]: Bullshit, though.

1540
02:03:27,961 --> 02:03:28,402
[SPEAKER_31]: Seriously.

1541
02:03:28,562 --> 02:03:29,963
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's just international messiness.

1542
02:03:30,103 --> 02:03:32,044
[SPEAKER_09]: I think somebody's pulling your leg over on GameFAQs.

1543
02:03:32,124 --> 02:03:32,785
[SPEAKER_09]: I honestly do.

1544
02:03:32,825 --> 02:03:33,865
[SPEAKER_31]: RIAA crap.

1545
02:03:33,885 --> 02:03:45,894
[SPEAKER_09]: They lost the lawsuit with the MP3s and shit, so... I mean, because when you get into the international stuff, because Canada was upheld in court that the people sharing files were protected in Canada.

1546
02:03:46,314 --> 02:03:50,056
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you're a Canadian user that downloaded off of DDRUK, you'll get off scot-free.

1547
02:03:50,076 --> 02:03:52,338
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you're an American user, hey, you're going to be screwed.

1548
02:03:52,955 --> 02:03:53,235
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1549
02:03:53,396 --> 02:03:53,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

1550
02:03:55,478 --> 02:03:57,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's the IPA, it's not the RIA.

1551
02:03:58,060 --> 02:04:02,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, as I was mentioning, dancing character, I have to show Rob.

1552
02:04:02,444 --> 02:04:04,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously this is not good radio because you can't see it.

1553
02:04:05,087 --> 02:04:07,910
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is something you would think I would have made.

1554
02:04:08,170 --> 02:04:15,177
[SPEAKER_07]: But I didn't make it, so... So anyways...

1555
02:04:18,092 --> 02:04:18,552
[SPEAKER_26]: Lovely.

1556
02:04:18,732 --> 02:04:20,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, a description for those at home.

1557
02:04:20,713 --> 02:04:25,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, somebody has created a DDR character for Stepmania that is a naked girl.

1558
02:04:25,754 --> 02:04:26,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, a topless girl.

1559
02:04:27,514 --> 02:04:33,415
[SPEAKER_09]: And her boobs in full glory, and wearing tight little panty bottoms or something she's got there.

1560
02:04:33,735 --> 02:04:34,575
[SPEAKER_09]: Little skirt bottom.

1561
02:04:34,935 --> 02:04:38,496
[SPEAKER_09]: What is the name of this character, and where can the little boys who want to masturbate to it down?

1562
02:04:38,776 --> 02:04:39,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I love that!

1563
02:04:39,596 --> 02:04:41,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you see on the upskirt cam, you could see her little...

1564
02:04:42,987 --> 02:04:45,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Poonani on the little obscure cam, did you see that?

1565
02:04:45,369 --> 02:04:48,012
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a little dark spot in the shape of a triangle.

1566
02:04:48,272 --> 02:04:50,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, where can the boys get this?

1567
02:04:51,615 --> 02:04:57,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's been taken down due to, I guess, bandwidth issues.

1568
02:04:58,342 --> 02:05:04,048
[SPEAKER_07]: But, it can be found...

1569
02:05:05,317 --> 02:05:10,519
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a thread on DDR Freak in the sim file section that you could find this.

1570
02:05:11,100 --> 02:05:28,287
[SPEAKER_07]: I luckily searched Google and in a cache page I found the link here, which I will later post to, I'll post the link in OrangeLodgeRadio.com where you can find it, which I'll upload to my site or something.

1571
02:05:29,454 --> 02:05:35,377
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the first thing I noticed is that you could see her cootie box when it was going up the skirt there.

1572
02:05:37,018 --> 02:05:39,239
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't believe you guys missed it.

1573
02:05:39,779 --> 02:05:41,940
[SPEAKER_09]: Now Jamie's even got that curious look on her face.

1574
02:05:46,663 --> 02:05:47,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

1575
02:05:48,064 --> 02:05:48,904
[SPEAKER_19]: That's ridiculous.

1576
02:05:49,744 --> 02:05:51,465
[SPEAKER_18]: Where is my pantsless rage?

1577
02:05:52,506 --> 02:05:53,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously.

1578
02:05:53,726 --> 02:05:55,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's our pantsless rage?

1579
02:05:55,267 --> 02:05:56,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Our boy dancers.

1580
02:05:58,209 --> 02:05:58,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Pervs.

1581
02:06:00,168 --> 02:06:01,549
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, enough of that.

1582
02:06:02,470 --> 02:06:04,971
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember where I got it, but some guy made it.

1583
02:06:05,332 --> 02:06:18,201
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm sure if you look over in, if you search for like black, oh is it Stepmania character, or it's like, I don't remember, it's just whatever they posted in the one thread.

1584
02:06:18,881 --> 02:06:28,848
[SPEAKER_07]: I found it pretty easy, but I will post a link, it will be in our forums to where you can find the wonderful Stepmania character.

1585
02:06:30,879 --> 02:06:34,782
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1586
02:07:00,134 --> 02:07:00,974
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what else to say.

1587
02:07:01,495 --> 02:07:03,355
[SPEAKER_09]: You're still giggling over there, Explicit.

1588
02:07:03,715 --> 02:07:08,317
[SPEAKER_09]: You're like a little 12-year-old boy who just saw boobies on the TV for the first time on HBO.

1589
02:07:09,838 --> 02:07:11,038
[SPEAKER_16]: Dude, change to Channel 9.

1590
02:07:11,079 --> 02:07:12,159
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a breast exam, girl.

1591
02:07:16,421 --> 02:07:17,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, this brings up a good topic.

1592
02:07:18,201 --> 02:07:19,482
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to go around the room.

1593
02:07:21,163 --> 02:07:24,224
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have to participate if you don't want to.

1594
02:07:24,844 --> 02:07:28,986
[SPEAKER_09]: But I want to talk about the first time you ever saw the naughty bits of the opposite gender.

1595
02:07:35,913 --> 02:07:36,634
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura?

1596
02:07:42,339 --> 02:07:48,304
[SPEAKER_19]: This is kind of embarrassing, but there was a kid I played with in my neighborhood and I was nine.

1597
02:07:48,964 --> 02:07:51,747
[SPEAKER_18]: And he thought that one day it would be funny to pull down his pants.

1598
02:07:53,688 --> 02:07:55,630
[SPEAKER_18]: And I told his mommy and got him spanked.

1599
02:08:00,919 --> 02:08:01,439
[SPEAKER_19]: That's hot.

1600
02:08:01,600 --> 02:08:02,941
[SPEAKER_19]: It was our next door neighbor.

1601
02:08:04,402 --> 02:08:08,045
[SPEAKER_19]: This is when I used to run around carrying my gizmo everywhere.

1602
02:08:08,305 --> 02:08:09,266
[SPEAKER_19]: My little gremlins doll.

1603
02:08:10,226 --> 02:08:10,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Gizmo, huh?

1604
02:08:11,307 --> 02:08:13,289
[SPEAKER_19]: You need to shut up, okay?

1605
02:08:14,250 --> 02:08:20,455
[SPEAKER_19]: But seriously, that was my first exposure and I thought it was incredibly stupid.

1606
02:08:23,617 --> 02:08:23,937
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright.

1607
02:08:24,078 --> 02:08:28,221
[SPEAKER_19]: My mommy... My mom had no idea how to explain to me.

1608
02:08:28,241 --> 02:08:29,382
[SPEAKER_19]: I was...

1609
02:08:31,948 --> 02:08:36,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, Mel B. You guys don't have to participate.

1610
02:08:36,832 --> 02:08:38,093
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just talking to whoever's got the mic.

1611
02:08:38,313 --> 02:08:40,575
[SPEAKER_35]: First time seeing live Naughty Bits, man.

1612
02:08:41,556 --> 02:08:43,937
[SPEAKER_35]: I mean, okay, like, all media aside.

1613
02:08:45,118 --> 02:08:45,559
[SPEAKER_35]: Gosh.

1614
02:08:47,060 --> 02:08:47,440
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't know.

1615
02:08:47,500 --> 02:08:54,826
[SPEAKER_35]: I think by the time I had, like, seen live ones, I'd been so desensitized by all the porn that my dad, like, hid underneath his bed and, like, in the cabinets.

1616
02:08:55,366 --> 02:08:58,028
[SPEAKER_35]: It really wasn't anything new to me other than, like,

1617
02:08:58,593 --> 02:09:00,133
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay, it's about time I saw this live.

1618
02:09:00,153 --> 02:09:01,374
[SPEAKER_35]: You know, it's 3D and...

1619
02:09:02,054 --> 02:09:02,134
[SPEAKER_09]: 3D?!

1620
02:09:02,154 --> 02:09:08,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, it was like... They didn't have any of that rad 70s porn with the glasses?

1621
02:09:09,836 --> 02:09:14,638
[SPEAKER_35]: No, and there weren't any cool, like, you know, rainbows in the background or, like, you know, little stars flying around.

1622
02:09:14,658 --> 02:09:26,221
[SPEAKER_35]: I mean, but... I guess it was a treat to see, like, you know, nice little shadows and, like, things just... Wow, there's texture to them and... Whoa, they're cold or... Wow, it's... It was...

1623
02:09:27,959 --> 02:09:33,262
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah, the first time I ever seen him was in my truck and it was in the back of the cab and it was a very cold night.

1624
02:09:34,403 --> 02:09:35,763
[SPEAKER_35]: We had to keep each other warm somehow.

1625
02:09:38,505 --> 02:09:39,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Anybody else care to go explicit?

1626
02:09:40,626 --> 02:09:47,349
[SPEAKER_31]: If coming out of your mom's vagina counts... Not quite there, buddy.

1627
02:09:47,369 --> 02:09:52,752
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, I was one years old.

1628
02:09:53,487 --> 02:09:56,990
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, I don't even remember what the hell happened when I was one.

1629
02:09:57,130 --> 02:09:59,511
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, let's go the year when I was three years old.

1630
02:10:01,593 --> 02:10:06,717
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, I come to the bathroom, someone rushes to the shower, naked.

1631
02:10:06,737 --> 02:10:10,359
[SPEAKER_31]: I was like, holy shit, what is this?

1632
02:10:10,599 --> 02:10:11,560
[SPEAKER_31]: And what does hair grow down there?

1633
02:10:11,580 --> 02:10:12,561
[SPEAKER_31]: Wow, this is getting interesting.

1634
02:10:12,581 --> 02:10:14,182
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay.

1635
02:10:23,410 --> 02:10:24,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I really want to bring up this topic?

1636
02:10:24,891 --> 02:10:25,231
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1637
02:10:25,271 --> 02:10:27,593
[SPEAKER_31]: Hey, you're the one who brought it.

1638
02:10:27,633 --> 02:10:28,013
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1639
02:10:28,473 --> 02:10:31,135
[SPEAKER_09]: I dated girls in high school, and that's how I saw boobs.

1640
02:10:31,515 --> 02:10:33,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Really, it wasn't any surprise.

1641
02:10:34,057 --> 02:10:36,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Mel, you'd seen it on TV enough times.

1642
02:10:36,379 --> 02:10:38,420
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just like, oh, now I've got them live and in person.

1643
02:10:39,140 --> 02:10:40,501
[SPEAKER_09]: But really, sad enough.

1644
02:10:41,482 --> 02:10:44,264
[SPEAKER_09]: But now, remember, ladies, I'm gay.

1645
02:10:45,384 --> 02:10:50,628
[SPEAKER_09]: But the first time I saw the lower equator was actually at a strip bar.

1646
02:10:52,318 --> 02:10:52,838
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1647
02:11:13,120 --> 02:11:13,640
[SPEAKER_07]: This is easy.

1648
02:11:15,562 --> 02:11:18,184
[SPEAKER_07]: I assume this is the first time live.

1649
02:11:18,645 --> 02:11:20,286
[SPEAKER_07]: It was 6th grade.

1650
02:11:20,366 --> 02:11:31,095
[SPEAKER_07]: They were doing presentations in my class for... We were studying Roman history or something like that.

1651
02:11:31,175 --> 02:11:32,116
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it wasn't Roman history.

1652
02:11:32,136 --> 02:11:32,677
[SPEAKER_07]: We were reading...

1653
02:11:34,969 --> 02:11:40,753
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we were reading, like, I want to say it was like, not Julius Caesar, no.

1654
02:11:42,834 --> 02:11:43,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Something to do with Greek and Romans.

1655
02:11:43,995 --> 02:11:45,635
[SPEAKER_07]: We were studying, like, history or something.

1656
02:11:46,296 --> 02:11:51,639
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was a presentation being done in the class, and, you know, people were dressing up for the part.

1657
02:11:51,739 --> 02:12:04,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this one chick, she wasn't too smart, so she didn't wear anything underneath it, and she was up on a chair, like, reciting something, and she got down off the chair, stepped on her toga, and the whole thing just came off.

1658
02:12:09,105 --> 02:12:10,106
[SPEAKER_07]: All in front of the class.

1659
02:12:12,848 --> 02:12:13,748
[SPEAKER_19]: How educational.

1660
02:12:14,269 --> 02:12:14,649
[SPEAKER_08]: It was.

1661
02:12:18,952 --> 02:12:19,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

1662
02:12:20,353 --> 02:12:20,733
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1663
02:12:21,874 --> 02:12:24,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, we're supposed to talk about games on this show.

1664
02:12:24,195 --> 02:12:25,036
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1665
02:12:25,136 --> 02:12:25,776
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so sorry.

1666
02:12:27,818 --> 02:12:29,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Games that little kids play.

1667
02:12:31,921 --> 02:12:32,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1668
02:12:32,614 --> 02:12:33,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to a break, guys.

1669
02:12:34,014 --> 02:12:36,095
[SPEAKER_09]: When we come back from the break, we're going to do the FUs of the week.

1670
02:12:36,115 --> 02:12:40,316
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to talk about who won the cage match and who knows, whatever else we feel like.

1671
02:12:40,877 --> 02:12:44,058
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to do whatever the hell we please, basically, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1672
02:12:44,518 --> 02:12:45,758
[SPEAKER_09]: So you just be ready for it.

1673
02:12:46,919 --> 02:12:48,539
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be back after this.

1674
02:12:49,379 --> 02:12:53,621
[SPEAKER_09]: I decided we'd do a break of some DDR songs, some pretty well-known DDR songs.

1675
02:12:53,961 --> 02:12:57,382
[SPEAKER_09]: And just for Jamie, I made the first song by Taku.

1676
02:12:58,478 --> 02:12:59,821
[SPEAKER_09]: and it's one we haven't played in a while.

1677
02:13:00,182 --> 02:13:02,587
[SPEAKER_09]: So starting it off we have Era starting off this mix.

1678
02:13:03,028 --> 02:13:03,429
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be back.

1679
02:13:52,456 --> 02:13:53,417
Thanks for watching!

1680
02:14:43,696 --> 02:14:45,058
Thanks for watching!

1681
02:16:36,449 --> 02:16:37,770
Thanks for watching!

1682
02:18:19,659 --> 02:18:28,285
[SPEAKER_12]: Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.

1683
02:18:34,189 --> 02:18:36,550
[SPEAKER_09]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1684
02:18:36,590 --> 02:18:37,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you guys for sticking with us.

1685
02:18:37,911 --> 02:18:39,612
[SPEAKER_09]: We're getting into the last hour of the show here.

1686
02:18:39,652 --> 02:18:43,815
[SPEAKER_09]: We have plenty of stuff coming up, including some favorite segments you've come to know and love.

1687
02:18:44,355 --> 02:18:48,078
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got to get one of those segments taken care of, though, and that would be the cage match.

1688
02:18:48,138 --> 02:18:49,719
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys want to know who won tonight's cage match?

1689
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:53,101
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to give props to the chat room.

1690
02:18:53,121 --> 02:18:55,362
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people voting tonight's cage match.

1691
02:18:55,463 --> 02:18:58,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Very pleased to see a lot of participation from the chat room tonight.

1692
02:18:58,344 --> 02:18:59,065
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what?

1693
02:18:59,385 --> 02:19:06,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Once again, one vote separating not only the winner from the second place song, but from the third place song as well.

1694
02:19:06,910 --> 02:19:09,132
[SPEAKER_09]: It was that freaking close tonight.

1695
02:19:09,592 --> 02:19:10,272
[SPEAKER_09]: So here it is.

1696
02:19:10,633 --> 02:19:13,875
[SPEAKER_09]: The winning song of tonight's cage match is...

1697
02:19:18,276 --> 02:19:20,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Echo Image with Endless Day.

1698
02:19:22,117 --> 02:19:23,197
[SPEAKER_09]: One more time.

1699
02:19:24,738 --> 02:19:26,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Very, very close.

1700
02:19:26,218 --> 02:19:28,799
[SPEAKER_09]: One vote, any other direction would have made all the difference.

1701
02:19:29,059 --> 02:19:30,379
[SPEAKER_09]: So, very nice.

1702
02:19:30,819 --> 02:19:32,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for participating, you guys.

1703
02:19:33,020 --> 02:19:34,300
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll do it again next week.

1704
02:19:35,060 --> 02:19:35,380
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1705
02:19:36,781 --> 02:19:37,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on.

1706
02:19:39,161 --> 02:19:41,682
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we're kind of getting into the last hour of the show.

1707
02:19:41,722 --> 02:19:45,524
[SPEAKER_09]: We really only have, what, FUs, Ask Orange Lounge, Left to Go, right?

1708
02:19:45,544 --> 02:19:46,604
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the usual bits.

1709
02:19:47,024 --> 02:19:59,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we get bored and we're looking for things to talk about on the show because, you know, if we don't talk about DDR, there'll be people out there that go, Man, that Orange Lounge Radio sucks!

1710
02:20:01,360 --> 02:20:03,722
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't ever talk about DDR.

1711
02:20:03,762 --> 02:20:07,304
[SPEAKER_11]: They talk about the first time they saw boobs or penises.

1712
02:20:08,084 --> 02:20:09,205
[SPEAKER_11]: They're all gay.

1713
02:20:10,085 --> 02:20:11,106
[SPEAKER_11]: What's wrong with them?

1714
02:20:11,426 --> 02:20:15,488
[SPEAKER_16]: And you know, chat room, you're really missing something without being able to see Rob's face while he does this.

1715
02:20:17,049 --> 02:20:18,370
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, I can talk about both at once.

1716
02:20:18,710 --> 02:20:21,071
[SPEAKER_11]: Man, everybody at Orange Lounge Radio is gay.

1717
02:20:21,391 --> 02:20:23,212
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a big gay station.

1718
02:20:23,272 --> 02:20:24,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything about it is gay.

1719
02:20:25,794 --> 02:20:26,574
[SPEAKER_31]: You mean unhappy?

1720
02:20:26,594 --> 02:20:26,674
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah.

1721
02:20:31,368 --> 02:20:32,829
[SPEAKER_09]: Where is that rainbow cake, man?

1722
02:20:33,450 --> 02:20:35,472
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, how fruity.

1723
02:20:35,812 --> 02:20:43,839
[SPEAKER_09]: In an effort to warm ourselves up more to the DDR community, we seek inspiration from posts from DDR Freak.

1724
02:20:46,060 --> 02:20:47,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, God, no.

1725
02:20:48,943 --> 02:20:49,663
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

1726
02:20:50,604 --> 02:20:53,647
[SPEAKER_10]: It's time for the DDR Chit Chat Post of the Week.

1727
02:20:54,027 --> 02:20:54,768
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, my God.

1728
02:20:58,280 --> 02:21:05,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Since we are syndicated now on DDR Freak Radio, we've got to give a shout out to our fellow friends over at DDR Freak.

1729
02:21:06,565 --> 02:21:11,908
[SPEAKER_09]: We're working together with the Freak by stealing one of their topics for one of our own.

1730
02:21:11,968 --> 02:21:15,330
[SPEAKER_10]: So here it is, the DDR topic of the week.

1731
02:21:16,951 --> 02:21:19,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Here it is, guys, and you all are going to have to answer this.

1732
02:21:20,012 --> 02:21:20,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Here it is.

1733
02:21:21,673 --> 02:21:23,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Subject of message.

1734
02:21:24,215 --> 02:21:26,276
[SPEAKER_09]: What are tournaments like?

1735
02:21:28,311 --> 02:21:33,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell on Earth Hell on Earth And you don't eat all day Now we're talking about DDR tournaments

1736
02:21:48,911 --> 02:21:50,412
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm talking about DDR tournaments too.

1737
02:21:51,533 --> 02:21:52,134
[SPEAKER_09]: Now wait a minute though.

1738
02:21:52,154 --> 02:21:57,979
[SPEAKER_09]: There was the one tournament we had in Sacramento where Lanky Style and Rice Princess were running the kitchen with deep fried Twinkies.

1739
02:21:59,200 --> 02:22:00,041
[SPEAKER_19]: I had half of one.

1740
02:22:00,421 --> 02:22:01,642
[SPEAKER_09]: So you did get to eat that day.

1741
02:22:02,263 --> 02:22:03,684
[SPEAKER_19]: That's all I needed to eat all day.

1742
02:22:06,246 --> 02:22:06,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Explicit.

1743
02:22:07,347 --> 02:22:08,768
[SPEAKER_09]: What are DDR tournaments like?

1744
02:22:09,269 --> 02:22:12,071
[SPEAKER_31]: Heaven or hell.

1745
02:22:12,091 --> 02:22:15,314
[SPEAKER_31]: The good thing about tournaments is of course you get to meet with a lot of people.

1746
02:22:16,320 --> 02:22:21,883
[SPEAKER_31]: Chitchat and compete so you can feel welcome to see how your skills match up with others.

1747
02:22:22,523 --> 02:22:24,885
[SPEAKER_31]: Are you better than everybody else or not?

1748
02:22:25,845 --> 02:22:27,866
[SPEAKER_31]: Some tournaments actually serve food.

1749
02:22:28,347 --> 02:22:31,368
[SPEAKER_31]: The upcoming tournament I'm organizing called Sacktown Smackdown.

1750
02:22:31,588 --> 02:22:32,429
[SPEAKER_31]: Not piss!

1751
02:22:33,489 --> 02:22:34,450
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't need to go back there.

1752
02:22:35,450 --> 02:22:36,271
[SPEAKER_31]: I'll talk to you about that.

1753
02:22:37,031 --> 02:22:38,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Talk to Mel about it another time.

1754
02:22:38,332 --> 02:22:39,993
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not bringing that subject back up this week.

1755
02:22:41,554 --> 02:22:42,354
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, okay.

1756
02:22:42,374 --> 02:22:43,074
[SPEAKER_31]: Back on topic.

1757
02:22:43,735 --> 02:22:45,796
[SPEAKER_31]: The tournament is to meet the organizers

1758
02:22:48,071 --> 02:22:52,893
[SPEAKER_31]: and for those who are lonely, they can visit the opposite sex if that's possible.

1759
02:22:54,293 --> 02:22:57,034
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, as for the hell part, this is where I get cranky.

1760
02:22:57,694 --> 02:23:00,075
[SPEAKER_31]: People bitch about the fucking pads.

1761
02:23:00,615 --> 02:23:02,516
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh wow, a pair doesn't work.

1762
02:23:04,076 --> 02:23:05,757
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, that's too bad.

1763
02:23:06,698 --> 02:23:09,120
[SPEAKER_31]: We only say that if it doesn't work immediately.

1764
02:23:09,160 --> 02:23:12,922
[SPEAKER_31]: You can't have it step up no matter how many pounds of pressure you put on it.

1765
02:23:13,723 --> 02:23:17,566
[SPEAKER_31]: But I've seen people complain because they tap it very loudly and get a miss.

1766
02:23:18,186 --> 02:23:19,187
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh wow, you got a miss.

1767
02:23:19,307 --> 02:23:19,727
[SPEAKER_31]: So what?

1768
02:23:20,067 --> 02:23:20,748
[SPEAKER_31]: Focus more.

1769
02:23:20,788 --> 02:23:21,568
[SPEAKER_31]: Don't give up.

1770
02:23:22,849 --> 02:23:25,571
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh my god, you screwed me over on the fucking tournament.

1771
02:23:25,831 --> 02:23:26,972
[SPEAKER_31]: Or complain about the rules.

1772
02:23:28,193 --> 02:23:32,056
[SPEAKER_31]: And of course, you get the butt-raping drama that's been going around and shit.

1773
02:23:32,981 --> 02:23:34,662
[SPEAKER_31]: Ooh, NorCal versus SoCal.

1774
02:23:35,442 --> 02:23:37,763
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh wow, what big of a deal is this?

1775
02:23:37,783 --> 02:23:39,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Seattle versus everybody.

1776
02:23:39,644 --> 02:23:41,605
[SPEAKER_35]: NorCal versus SoCal ain't no rivalry, man.

1777
02:23:41,625 --> 02:23:42,646
[SPEAKER_35]: Especially in freestyle.

1778
02:23:42,886 --> 02:23:44,307
[SPEAKER_35]: That's a one-sided ass-whooping.

1779
02:23:44,327 --> 02:23:45,107
[SPEAKER_35]: That ain't a rivalry.

1780
02:23:45,667 --> 02:23:47,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh dear, oh dear, he's starting something.

1781
02:23:47,809 --> 02:23:50,390
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, that's what I'm getting to in the freestyle section.

1782
02:23:50,430 --> 02:23:53,391
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, freestyle is always about the opinions.

1783
02:23:53,852 --> 02:24:01,295
[SPEAKER_31]: You can't complain and say you deserve first place or second place unless you've got something that's determined that's favoring one side or the other.

1784
02:24:01,715 --> 02:24:02,576
[SPEAKER_31]: If that is the case...

1785
02:24:03,069 --> 02:24:04,270
[SPEAKER_31]: They shouldn't even be judges.

1786
02:24:04,690 --> 02:24:07,873
[SPEAKER_31]: Of course, Mel B knows what kind of tournaments those have been.

1787
02:24:09,554 --> 02:24:11,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, Mel B. I gotta ask Mel B, though.

1788
02:24:12,076 --> 02:24:18,442
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll continue to address to Mel B. Okay, Mel B, because you've won a couple tournaments, and you've had a hand in judging and putting together some.

1789
02:24:18,982 --> 02:24:19,903
[SPEAKER_10]: What are tournaments like?

1790
02:24:20,163 --> 02:24:20,664
[SPEAKER_10]: Payday.

1791
02:24:25,287 --> 02:24:27,950
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Mel Ego B, everybody!

1792
02:24:28,770 --> 02:24:31,973
[SPEAKER_35]: As far as I'm concerned, there's two things that I know when I have a good tourney.

1793
02:24:32,372 --> 02:24:35,474
[SPEAKER_35]: I come out paid, and when I'm done back home, there are panties on my drawer.

1794
02:24:39,516 --> 02:24:42,437
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't know, it's kind of hard to say.

1795
02:24:42,837 --> 02:24:47,940
[SPEAKER_35]: Obviously, if we're going back about five years ago, tournaments were a big thing.

1796
02:24:48,560 --> 02:24:52,703
[SPEAKER_35]: We were trying to promote the game, we were trying to get people aware of this.

1797
02:24:54,472 --> 02:24:55,973
[SPEAKER_35]: No, I mean, we took tournaments seriously.

1798
02:24:56,013 --> 02:25:02,576
[SPEAKER_35]: We figured, you know, we had to put our best foot forward to make this game look good and say like, hey, this is something everyone can enjoy and all that good stuff.

1799
02:25:02,776 --> 02:25:04,677
[SPEAKER_35]: And so it was sort of fun.

1800
02:25:04,717 --> 02:25:06,798
[SPEAKER_35]: But when I got to my first tournament, I won.

1801
02:25:06,838 --> 02:25:10,320
[SPEAKER_35]: And like by that, I think that just kind of like maybe see tournaments a whole different way.

1802
02:25:10,340 --> 02:25:11,780
[SPEAKER_35]: Like I had to go out there and I had to win.

1803
02:25:11,840 --> 02:25:16,082
[SPEAKER_35]: I wasn't out there to, I mean, yeah, I was out there to have fun and, you know, socialize and promote it.

1804
02:25:16,122 --> 02:25:22,285
[SPEAKER_35]: But when all was said and done, I didn't drive down five hours to LA to be second place or to be, you know, to have a good show.

1805
02:25:22,485 --> 02:25:23,066
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, snap.

1806
02:25:23,086 --> 02:25:23,666
[SPEAKER_35]: Screw that.

1807
02:25:24,093 --> 02:25:48,637
[SPEAKER_35]: but um so yeah after all you know tourneys you know yeah I got bigger prizes got my solo machine got my poppin music controller at the last tourney which is pretty dope by the way thank you desktop arcade um I would say as far as organizing a tourney those things are not fun yeah organizers are not that great I think perfect tech tourneys are fucking boring as hell because it's I mean it's

1808
02:25:50,227 --> 02:26:19,431
[SPEAKER_35]: yeah there's just basically nothing new you can put to PA I mean yeah you can put on different modifiers but then it's like you're not really gauging someone's perfect attack ability you're gauging their improv you know their sight reading more or less which is not a bad thing I mean it's something that should be tested but at the same time it's kind of just kind of gone to the wayside it's boring in my opinion at least with freestyle there's that chance you can see something new and something cool but tournaments are pretty fun if you just don't hang around the venue too long

1809
02:26:21,496 --> 02:26:31,240
[SPEAKER_09]: DDR Tournaments for me, DDR Tournaments for me are about bringing a lot of Febreze and a super soaker to give some of these kids a bath.

1810
02:26:32,300 --> 02:26:32,820
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm kidding.

1811
02:26:33,320 --> 02:26:33,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I'm not.

1812
02:26:33,861 --> 02:26:42,584
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, DDR Tournaments, it's all about community to me, and I could give a shit about who's winning the tournament, and I've participated in tournaments, and I've lost big.

1813
02:26:42,904 --> 02:26:45,465
[SPEAKER_09]: I've done decent in some as well, but...

1814
02:26:46,337 --> 02:26:51,919
[SPEAKER_09]: To me, yes, to me it's about making people know who I am.

1815
02:26:54,280 --> 02:27:01,683
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll tell you what, after the March Madness where we had DDR Idol, you know who I am.

1816
02:27:05,806 --> 02:27:08,249
[SPEAKER_09]: It's about making your DDR penis as big as possible.

1817
02:27:08,269 --> 02:27:10,872
[SPEAKER_31]: We need to do DDR Idol again.

1818
02:27:10,912 --> 02:27:14,856
[SPEAKER_31]: Are you actually going to come back?

1819
02:27:14,896 --> 02:27:16,318
[SPEAKER_09]: The good doctor's thinking about it.

1820
02:27:16,338 --> 02:27:19,001
[SPEAKER_09]: You just need something to get him out of the closet again.

1821
02:27:20,242 --> 02:27:25,548
[SPEAKER_31]: Remember in my tournament, you get to improv with a prop.

1822
02:27:27,672 --> 02:27:28,092
[SPEAKER_31]: Think about it.

1823
02:27:28,252 --> 02:27:30,593
[SPEAKER_31]: That's a new thing I'm putting up for freestyle.

1824
02:27:30,673 --> 02:27:31,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds pretty hot.

1825
02:27:31,353 --> 02:27:33,213
[SPEAKER_31]: Improvision with a prop.

1826
02:27:33,793 --> 02:27:35,114
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll talk to the good doctor about it.

1827
02:27:35,134 --> 02:27:35,954
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see what he comes up with.

1828
02:27:36,054 --> 02:27:43,215
[SPEAKER_35]: Or you're probably saving up for DDR History X. I don't want to beat the Dr. Dick thing into the ground, though.

1829
02:27:44,116 --> 02:27:45,416
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm only going to use him on a rainy day.

1830
02:27:45,916 --> 02:27:47,356
[SPEAKER_31]: How can you not?

1831
02:27:49,257 --> 02:27:49,637
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

1832
02:27:49,697 --> 02:27:50,037
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

1833
02:27:50,617 --> 02:27:50,897
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1834
02:27:51,617 --> 02:27:53,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Shark Scroll, anything you wanted to add to this discussion?

1835
02:27:54,218 --> 02:27:55,298
[SPEAKER_16]: What is a tournament like?

1836
02:27:55,888 --> 02:27:56,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1837
02:27:56,308 --> 02:27:56,769
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1838
02:27:57,169 --> 02:27:58,010
[SPEAKER_16]: Find my friends.

1839
02:27:58,110 --> 02:27:59,110
[SPEAKER_16]: Jabber, jabber, jabber.

1840
02:27:59,170 --> 02:28:00,051
[SPEAKER_16]: Have they started yet?

1841
02:28:00,491 --> 02:28:01,212
[SPEAKER_16]: Jabber, jabber, jabber.

1842
02:28:01,252 --> 02:28:01,652
[SPEAKER_16]: Another hour.

1843
02:28:01,692 --> 02:28:02,653
[SPEAKER_16]: Have they started yet?

1844
02:28:02,773 --> 02:28:03,634
[SPEAKER_16]: Jabber, jabber, jabber.

1845
02:28:04,254 --> 02:28:05,095
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, there's a routine.

1846
02:28:05,135 --> 02:28:05,655
[SPEAKER_16]: Who's on?

1847
02:28:06,336 --> 02:28:07,437
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, we just missed the entire thing.

1848
02:28:07,517 --> 02:28:07,737
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, well.

1849
02:28:08,718 --> 02:28:09,078
[SPEAKER_16]: That's it.

1850
02:28:10,579 --> 02:28:14,302
[SPEAKER_16]: And most of the time it involves doing something completely unrelated to DDR, like actually mini-golfing.

1851
02:28:14,482 --> 02:28:18,084
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, SharkScroll and I met for the first time at a DDR tournament.

1852
02:28:19,365 --> 02:28:20,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Just jabber, jabber, jabber.

1853
02:28:20,766 --> 02:28:21,207
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

1854
02:28:21,227 --> 02:28:24,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Because DarkSakura and I were pissed that we screwed up on PA.

1855
02:28:24,759 --> 02:28:28,140
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I met you before the PA, because I remember you guys went to go get the bats.

1856
02:28:28,921 --> 02:28:30,381
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah!

1857
02:28:30,481 --> 02:28:31,401
[SPEAKER_09]: And the toy horns.

1858
02:28:31,501 --> 02:28:36,043
[SPEAKER_09]: But I remember we screwed up on PA so bad, and we got your input on what we should do for the freestyle.

1859
02:28:36,063 --> 02:28:45,046
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, like, me, DarkSakura, IguanaGirl, I remember we all went to the Rite Aid, and we got the bats, and we did the Stomp to My Beat routine, which was the best routine I was ever a part of, by the way.

1860
02:28:46,387 --> 02:28:50,708
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, the funny thing is, I remember when I met you, and I know I've told you this, but I'll tell the entire world this.

1861
02:28:51,008 --> 02:28:52,889
[SPEAKER_16]: My first two thoughts when I met Rob...

1862
02:28:53,416 --> 02:28:54,337
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow, he's hot.

1863
02:28:54,637 --> 02:28:55,578
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow, he's gay.

1864
02:28:56,478 --> 02:28:58,700
[SPEAKER_16]: In that order, at that speed.

1865
02:28:58,800 --> 02:28:59,240
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1866
02:29:00,141 --> 02:29:00,761
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, honey.

1867
02:29:06,005 --> 02:29:06,605
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm blushing.

1868
02:29:07,706 --> 02:29:08,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop, girl.

1869
02:29:08,567 --> 02:29:10,828
[SPEAKER_09]: See, this is about tournaments being good for my ego.

1870
02:29:11,289 --> 02:29:13,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, Loki, anything you want to add about DDR tournaments?

1871
02:29:17,893 --> 02:29:21,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they're long and boring.

1872
02:29:23,638 --> 02:29:24,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's my take on them.

1873
02:29:25,819 --> 02:29:29,440
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, um, watching Titanic.

1874
02:29:31,580 --> 02:29:46,765
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like you keep expecting something, you keep expecting something cool to happen, and someone says that there's something really good about it, but you just don't see it no matter how long you watch it, and after you're done, you want your three hours back.

1875
02:29:46,865 --> 02:29:49,146
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's pretty much, you know...

1876
02:29:51,480 --> 02:30:00,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and you know, you expect something major to happen, like Leonardo DiCaprio to die, but then you find out he just was acting, so.

1877
02:30:02,923 --> 02:30:05,103
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, you know, we're all shocked to find out the boat sinks.

1878
02:30:05,864 --> 02:30:06,404
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh my!

1879
02:30:07,744 --> 02:30:09,244
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for ruining it for me, Rob!

1880
02:30:09,264 --> 02:30:14,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Something completely unexpected happens, like the same people winning the tournaments all the time.

1881
02:30:14,826 --> 02:30:16,066
[SPEAKER_07]: That's wonderful.

1882
02:30:18,527 --> 02:30:19,027
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all right.

1883
02:30:20,188 --> 02:30:21,528
[SPEAKER_09]: The doctor's going to make a comeback.

1884
02:30:21,568 --> 02:30:22,149
[SPEAKER_09]: Just you wait.

1885
02:30:23,549 --> 02:30:23,870
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1886
02:30:23,950 --> 02:30:25,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, let's move on.

1887
02:30:26,051 --> 02:30:28,532
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was our DDR Freak post of the week.

1888
02:30:28,752 --> 02:30:29,252
[SPEAKER_09]: There you have it.

1889
02:30:29,352 --> 02:30:31,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Our DDR Chit Chat post of the week.

1890
02:30:31,973 --> 02:30:34,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep posting over in DDR Freak on the DDR Chit Chat boards.

1891
02:30:34,975 --> 02:30:41,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Your post, if it's interesting enough, could be fodder for this show.

1892
02:30:41,378 --> 02:30:41,638
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1893
02:30:42,096 --> 02:30:47,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on, let's get into the FUs of the week.

1894
02:30:47,618 --> 02:30:51,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, why is it that we have to do these FUs every single week?

1895
02:30:51,480 --> 02:30:54,000
[SPEAKER_19]: Because life is a big stinking pile of shit.

1896
02:30:55,121 --> 02:31:00,463
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, this is bad.

1897
02:31:02,184 --> 02:31:02,964
[SPEAKER_28]: Here is justice.

1898
02:31:10,365 --> 02:31:14,328
[SPEAKER_19]: An FU goes toward the entirety of my week since Wednesday.

1899
02:31:15,168 --> 02:31:18,310
[SPEAKER_19]: For getting three hours of sleep in as many days.

1900
02:31:20,671 --> 02:31:23,633
[SPEAKER_19]: For being an emotional wreck for the past few days.

1901
02:31:25,094 --> 02:31:29,477
[SPEAKER_19]: An FU to basically almost having to go find my own damn apartment.

1902
02:31:31,878 --> 02:31:37,262
[SPEAKER_19]: To being harassed by the cops at Denny's over an open confrontation.

1903
02:31:37,282 --> 02:31:39,143
[SPEAKER_17]: To your wife.

1904
02:31:41,185 --> 02:31:41,725
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not funny.

1905
02:31:42,365 --> 02:31:43,065
[SPEAKER_19]: It's really serious.

1906
02:31:44,386 --> 02:31:53,030
[SPEAKER_19]: Um... Just F you to all that, and having to compromise for a worthy cause.

1907
02:31:54,431 --> 02:31:55,491
[SPEAKER_19]: That's it, that's all I'm gonna say.

1908
02:31:56,972 --> 02:32:00,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, then we'll move on to... Loki!

1909
02:32:03,355 --> 02:32:07,997
[SPEAKER_07]: First off, thank you to myself for having to buy another fucking hard drive for this goddamn computer.

1910
02:32:08,615 --> 02:32:18,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I didn't calculate the voltage needed for these things, so... You know, one rail of the power supply would've been maxed out if I bought these other things.

1911
02:32:18,684 --> 02:32:23,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, you plug in a USB anything and the computer crashes, so that would've sucked.

1912
02:32:24,208 --> 02:32:30,934
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I got a larger hard drive out of it, now I have this really small 30 gig laptop hard drive that... I have no fucking clue what I'm gonna do with.

1913
02:32:31,735 --> 02:32:36,879
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, fuck you, those goddamn slow people in front of me today while I was coming home.

1914
02:32:37,628 --> 02:32:42,671
[SPEAKER_07]: You were literally driving like 20 miles an hour in 50 mile an hour area.

1915
02:32:43,432 --> 02:32:44,773
[SPEAKER_07]: I drive by you and guess what?

1916
02:32:44,793 --> 02:32:45,273
[SPEAKER_07]: You're old.

1917
02:32:45,733 --> 02:32:46,534
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a shocker.

1918
02:32:47,935 --> 02:32:55,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, honestly, driving slower will not get you, will not let you live longer, basically.

1919
02:32:55,640 --> 02:32:57,241
[SPEAKER_07]: You cannot slow down time.

1920
02:32:58,101 --> 02:33:00,903
[SPEAKER_07]: So please, drive the speed limit or faster.

1921
02:33:01,464 --> 02:33:02,164
[SPEAKER_19]: May I add one?

1922
02:33:03,185 --> 02:33:03,345
[SPEAKER_19]: F.U.

1923
02:33:03,385 --> 02:33:04,886
[SPEAKER_19]: people with halogen headlights, thank you.

1924
02:33:05,493 --> 02:33:07,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yes, I'd like to second that.

1925
02:33:07,515 --> 02:33:12,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing that I like more than having the sun staring at me through my back window.

1926
02:33:13,440 --> 02:33:21,647
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, because I'm glad you can see five miles in front of you, but I can't even see two feet in front of me because your lights are burning my retinas.

1927
02:33:22,227 --> 02:33:26,671
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, but, you know, I fucking hate all these trucks with, like, fog lamps and shit on them.

1928
02:33:27,192 --> 02:33:30,715
[SPEAKER_07]: They have so much, you know, fucking light coming out of them, I literally...

1929
02:33:31,596 --> 02:33:36,762
[SPEAKER_07]: I can see them cutting a hole in the fog, you know, literally just evaporating right in front of them.

1930
02:33:38,124 --> 02:33:38,744
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just nuts.

1931
02:33:39,065 --> 02:33:42,969
[SPEAKER_07]: No wonder deers fucking, you know, get hit by cars because they stare through the headlights.

1932
02:33:43,250 --> 02:33:44,591
[SPEAKER_07]: They, like, literally go blind.

1933
02:33:45,032 --> 02:33:46,854
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just, like, brain shocked.

1934
02:33:48,513 --> 02:33:49,554
[SPEAKER_07]: So that fucking sucked.

1935
02:33:50,355 --> 02:33:55,819
[SPEAKER_07]: And just basically, you know, fuck you to this stupid Dremel attachment that I have.

1936
02:33:55,859 --> 02:34:04,146
[SPEAKER_07]: This little flex shaft thing that supposedly allows you to use a Dremel tool in really tight places and stuff.

1937
02:34:04,386 --> 02:34:11,633
[SPEAKER_07]: But the goddamn thing, you know, I put the bit inside of it and it threw the goddamn saw blade out at me, so that sucked.

1938
02:34:15,103 --> 02:34:18,926
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to hear any of your giggling over a flex shaft in tight places.

1939
02:34:22,108 --> 02:34:23,109
[SPEAKER_07]: The hell with you people.

1940
02:34:24,751 --> 02:34:28,774
[SPEAKER_19]: You're saying about talking about putting things in tight places in this crowd.

1941
02:34:31,701 --> 02:34:32,061
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

1942
02:34:32,101 --> 02:34:33,722
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds like fun, girl.

1943
02:34:35,242 --> 02:34:44,105
[SPEAKER_07]: And a Final Fantasy-related FU to this guy named Warchief, who is a complete moron, who I literally think is retarded and doesn't speak English.

1944
02:34:44,905 --> 02:34:47,766
[SPEAKER_07]: So, way to go, retarded people.

1945
02:34:48,046 --> 02:34:48,566
[SPEAKER_37]: Dark!

1946
02:34:48,886 --> 02:34:50,386
[SPEAKER_37]: Final Fantasy fun!

1947
02:34:51,047 --> 02:34:54,828
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um... Yay.

1948
02:34:55,688 --> 02:34:56,988
[SPEAKER_07]: So, to hell with all that.

1949
02:34:57,528 --> 02:34:59,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, really, it's been a pretty decent week, though.

1950
02:35:01,721 --> 02:35:02,021
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm done.

1951
02:35:10,268 --> 02:35:17,513
[SPEAKER_09]: An FU to my mouse that just decided to die on me so I can't control the show right now except with the keyboard.

1952
02:35:17,913 --> 02:35:20,355
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is going to be an interesting second half of the show.

1953
02:35:20,675 --> 02:35:24,098
[SPEAKER_09]: I've just got to go run and get the spare battery so I've got to keep my FUs kind of short.

1954
02:35:25,459 --> 02:35:27,781
[SPEAKER_09]: FU to the Valero that just opened up.

1955
02:35:28,882 --> 02:35:30,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Literally across the street.

1956
02:35:30,142 --> 02:35:32,724
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you noticed, they've been building a gas station across the street.

1957
02:35:33,144 --> 02:35:37,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to set this up, the Orange Lounge Studios are in the middle of fucking nowhere, okay?

1958
02:35:37,567 --> 02:35:40,628
[SPEAKER_09]: And they just finally built a gas station, like, literally right across the street from us.

1959
02:35:40,969 --> 02:35:42,289
[SPEAKER_09]: But now it has a mini-mart.

1960
02:35:42,630 --> 02:35:46,032
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course these mini-marts are gonna be freaking marked up to all hell.

1961
02:35:46,492 --> 02:35:47,893
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's so convenient!

1962
02:35:48,393 --> 02:35:53,716
[SPEAKER_09]: So now I'm gonna end up paying, like, $5 for a 12-pack of Pepsi because, well, shit, it's right across the street.

1963
02:35:54,196 --> 02:35:54,857
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm lazy.

1964
02:35:56,894 --> 02:35:57,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, alright.

1965
02:35:57,695 --> 02:36:00,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Continue from the previous weeks that I've not been saying FU's.

1966
02:36:18,997 --> 02:36:23,922
[SPEAKER_31]: A big F you goes to almost everybody who keeps calling my god damn tournament Piss.

1967
02:36:25,504 --> 02:36:29,908
[SPEAKER_31]: Just cause some people spelled it Paradise Island, Sacktown, Smackdown.

1968
02:36:31,050 --> 02:36:32,671
[SPEAKER_31]: It doesn't mean it is called Piss.

1969
02:36:32,731 --> 02:36:34,373
[SPEAKER_31]: Just call it Sacktown Smackdown.

1970
02:36:36,775 --> 02:36:38,637
[SPEAKER_31]: Since when did we have a Piss attack?

1971
02:36:40,319 --> 02:36:41,000
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm on a perfect...

1972
02:36:41,696 --> 02:36:47,681
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't know, the first Sacramento attorney I remember was called Scat, so... That was not my idea.

1973
02:36:49,944 --> 02:37:00,333
[SPEAKER_19]: But, on an odd enough note, I actually found two of the Scat t-shirts in my closet while looking for stuff, so maybe we'll throw it out as a prize.

1974
02:37:03,035 --> 02:37:04,437
[SPEAKER_19]: T-shirts from the bottom of my closet.

1975
02:37:04,477 --> 02:37:05,798
[SPEAKER_12]: The mouse is fixed, thank you.

1976
02:37:07,799 --> 02:37:15,105
[SPEAKER_31]: Another F he goes to, someone's throwing a fucking glass, a fucking, um, slowly bottle in the fucking road again.

1977
02:37:15,625 --> 02:37:16,626
[SPEAKER_31]: What am I supposed to do?

1978
02:37:19,488 --> 02:37:26,213
[SPEAKER_31]: Don't fucking F. I drive, I drive back and forth every day and I see someone throw a damn bottle out of nowhere.

1979
02:37:26,854 --> 02:37:28,295
[SPEAKER_31]: Who the hell do you think you are?

1980
02:37:28,615 --> 02:37:31,617
[SPEAKER_31]: This is $1,000 fine if you throw anything out the window.

1981
02:37:31,657 --> 02:37:32,178
[SPEAKER_31]: If you get caught.

1982
02:37:36,997 --> 02:37:44,421
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, if you get caught, but it's because the cops are so lazy eating their fucking 12 donuts or Krispy Kreme donuts.

1983
02:37:46,142 --> 02:37:50,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, now, don't be getting mad at cops for eating donuts.

1984
02:37:50,585 --> 02:37:52,726
[SPEAKER_07]: They have to have breakfast just like you and me.

1985
02:37:53,146 --> 02:37:58,710
[SPEAKER_07]: And goddammit, if they decide to frequent a donut place, then that's their god-given right.

1986
02:38:02,510 --> 02:38:05,815
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm not going to go with the freaking donut issue.

1987
02:38:05,895 --> 02:38:09,821
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen a cop... It's donut's fault for being so goddamn delicious.

1988
02:38:11,043 --> 02:38:12,725
[SPEAKER_31]: And it's too damn round as well.

1989
02:38:14,535 --> 02:38:39,015
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm not gonna go, okay, uh, let me see, another F he goes to DDRUK for shutting down, of course, he's got people trying to spy over MP3s and shit, but like I stated earlier, I said, we can always find our counter lawsuit for, for bargaining our privacy and shit, so, all is forgiven, and if not really, we beat that shit out of him,

1990
02:38:40,714 --> 02:38:40,934
[SPEAKER_31]: Mel B!

1991
02:38:56,630 --> 02:39:08,359
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh gosh, well, after you go to my, uh, workplace over at Navco, real smooth to have a QA department of about, oh, about maybe 60 strong or so, and have, like, six computers for all of us to use.

1992
02:39:08,459 --> 02:39:12,242
[SPEAKER_35]: Especially when we're trying to bug, like, a really, uh, big project here.

1993
02:39:12,842 --> 02:39:14,223
[SPEAKER_35]: Do you have Katamari Stress Balls?

1994
02:39:14,243 --> 02:39:14,363
[SPEAKER_35]: Maybe...

1995
02:39:44,093 --> 02:39:53,658
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah, I'm actually, funny enough, one of the people who I know at Namco, just transferred from Konami, works in the marketing division, so I'm going to try to see if she can be my hookup for stuff.

1996
02:39:54,139 --> 02:39:57,580
[SPEAKER_35]: And she's Japanese, too, so that's a double-plot.

1997
02:39:58,321 --> 02:40:03,544
[SPEAKER_17]: I did find out that for the LucasArts people, they get thermal nuclear detonator shuffles.

1998
02:40:04,264 --> 02:40:08,226
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, yeah, so, yeah, happy to them.

1999
02:40:08,486 --> 02:40:09,087
[SPEAKER_35]: Happy to...

2000
02:40:09,980 --> 02:40:12,921
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you to myself for losing my damn keys on Friday night.

2001
02:40:13,141 --> 02:40:17,202
[SPEAKER_35]: Apparently what happened was it ended up in Shark's girl's handbag somehow.

2002
02:40:17,222 --> 02:40:19,603
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't know if she had a hand in this.

2003
02:40:19,883 --> 02:40:21,923
[SPEAKER_15]: I swear to you, I had the bag on your chair.

2004
02:40:21,943 --> 02:40:25,404
[SPEAKER_15]: You threw the keys on the chair when you walked in the door and it fell in my bag.

2005
02:40:25,424 --> 02:40:27,745
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait, you're the responsible one.

2006
02:40:27,765 --> 02:40:30,246
[SPEAKER_15]: You should know what you're saying.

2007
02:40:30,326 --> 02:40:34,047
[SPEAKER_35]: So yeah, thank you to myself for just losing my keys like I always do.

2008
02:40:34,087 --> 02:40:35,767
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank God I actually found it.

2009
02:40:36,267 --> 02:40:38,028
[SPEAKER_35]: But that's about it.

2010
02:40:38,655 --> 02:40:40,196
[SPEAKER_35]: Life is actually alright otherwise.

2011
02:40:41,557 --> 02:40:42,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Sharksgirl.

2012
02:40:43,438 --> 02:40:44,979
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't really have anything.

2013
02:40:45,059 --> 02:40:46,120
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm feeling pretty mellow.

2014
02:40:47,841 --> 02:40:49,001
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to not being happy.

2015
02:40:49,161 --> 02:40:50,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Or not being angsty.

2016
02:40:50,242 --> 02:40:51,563
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to being happy and not being angsty.

2017
02:40:52,724 --> 02:40:56,086
[SPEAKER_15]: F you to you for giving me an F you.

2018
02:40:56,646 --> 02:40:57,506
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I was looking for.

2019
02:40:59,127 --> 02:41:00,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Nelly, any F yous?

2020
02:41:01,226 --> 02:41:03,747
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for ruining an entire continuity that I grew up with.

2021
02:41:03,967 --> 02:41:04,827
[SPEAKER_20]: I want my $8 back.

2022
02:41:04,867 --> 02:41:05,287
[SPEAKER_20]: Exactly.

2023
02:41:31,634 --> 02:41:33,735
[SPEAKER_19]: Star Wars was my first movie ever.

2024
02:41:34,476 --> 02:41:37,837
[SPEAKER_19]: I was one and my mom drug me screaming to the movie theater.

2025
02:41:38,197 --> 02:41:40,639
[SPEAKER_19]: However, I would be quiet whenever Darth Vader was on the screen.

2026
02:41:40,779 --> 02:41:44,901
[SPEAKER_19]: That would show that I was meant to have a life of evil.

2027
02:41:48,443 --> 02:41:49,903
[SPEAKER_19]: Just screw him.

2028
02:41:50,904 --> 02:41:53,265
[SPEAKER_19]: He's messed with my childhood.

2029
02:41:54,365 --> 02:41:56,286
[SPEAKER_09]: But he did cast Natalie Portman in his movies.

2030
02:41:58,327 --> 02:41:59,328
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gay and I'd hit that.

2031
02:42:01,226 --> 02:42:04,067
[SPEAKER_19]: And she's one of five people in that movie who have any talent.

2032
02:42:06,227 --> 02:42:06,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Very true.

2033
02:42:08,208 --> 02:42:08,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2034
02:42:09,068 --> 02:42:09,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, now, man.

2035
02:42:09,848 --> 02:42:10,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Chewbacca.

2036
02:42:11,669 --> 02:42:12,009
[SPEAKER_07]: That's Oscar.

2037
02:42:12,049 --> 02:42:13,909
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm looking forward to seeing the Wookiee planet, though.

2038
02:42:15,470 --> 02:42:15,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, God.

2039
02:42:16,190 --> 02:42:17,670
[SPEAKER_08]: They get out of the ship.

2040
02:42:18,271 --> 02:42:19,471
[SPEAKER_08]: What the hell's going on?

2041
02:42:19,491 --> 02:42:19,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh!

2042
02:42:21,004 --> 02:42:25,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Dark Knight says, F you to cold weather and ice.

2043
02:42:52,045 --> 02:42:57,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Peralta says, F you to the people who hate my little Euro car with the bright halogen lights.

2044
02:42:57,810 --> 02:42:58,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, he didn't say halogen lights.

2045
02:42:58,971 --> 02:43:00,973

[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2081
02:45:26,095 --> 02:45:32,917

2089
02:46:04,779 --> 02:46:08,920

02:46:38,462 --> 02:46:39,722
[SPEAKER_09]: Like serious, but Zerious.

02:46:40,922 --> 02:46:41,562
[SPEAKER_09]: My bad.

2105
02:46:41,862 --> 02:46:42,382
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm white.

2106
02:46:42,482 --> 02:46:42,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

2107
02:46:43,363 --> 02:46:44,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Dork says, F you to work.

2108
02:46:44,883 --> 02:46:46,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Because of it, I almost got shot.

2109
02:46:48,464 --> 02:46:49,484
[SPEAKER_09]: And Zaku says...

2110
02:46:51,091 --> 02:46:55,233
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to the sky taking a shit on the east coast in the form of snow this weekend.

2111
02:46:55,293 --> 02:46:56,254
[SPEAKER_09]: At least it's not yellow snow.

2112
02:46:56,794 --> 02:46:59,575
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to the current school semester with a shitty GPA.

2113
02:47:00,096 --> 02:47:02,877
[SPEAKER_09]: And F you to being laid off from my current job on Friday.

2114
02:47:03,157 --> 02:47:03,497
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up?

2115
02:47:08,660 --> 02:47:10,941
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't pronounce this guy's name right no matter what.

2116
02:47:12,602 --> 02:47:13,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Zyrus.

2117
02:47:16,966 --> 02:47:17,748
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm getting yelled at.

2118
02:47:20,113 --> 02:47:22,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Flynn says, F you to PCs, Max Rock.

2119
02:47:24,703 --> 02:47:25,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you got a cheer there from...

2120
02:47:27,282 --> 02:47:32,464
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, I do have to say that I'm considering getting a Mac after they get cheaper for one reason.

2121
02:47:32,804 --> 02:47:33,285
[SPEAKER_19]: Mac Mini.

2122
02:47:33,325 --> 02:47:37,326
[SPEAKER_19]: I want the Mac Mini to build a countertop main machine out of.

2123
02:47:37,346 --> 02:47:40,188
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a lot of people that are considering using Mac Minis for other things.

2124
02:47:40,488 --> 02:47:40,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2125
02:47:41,048 --> 02:47:44,049
[SPEAKER_19]: I wouldn't use it to actually, you know, use it for a computer.

2126
02:47:45,030 --> 02:47:47,131
[SPEAKER_09]: I want the laptops to come down to those kinds of prices.

2127
02:47:47,511 --> 02:47:51,113
[SPEAKER_19]: Except since a lot of my major is now graphic arts and taught in the Mac Lab.

2128
02:47:53,734 --> 02:47:54,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

2129
02:47:55,735 --> 02:47:56,615
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's

2130
02:47:57,456 --> 02:48:02,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you guys for participating in tonight's FUs of the Week.

2131
02:48:11,381 --> 02:48:14,983
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to my cable modem and CD DVD drives for being out.

2132
02:48:15,243 --> 02:48:17,404
[SPEAKER_09]: Can still get on AIM via my cell at least.

2133
02:48:17,844 --> 02:48:19,224
[SPEAKER_09]: But she's unable to listen to the show.

2134
02:48:19,385 --> 02:48:20,745
[SPEAKER_19]: I actually had another one to add.

2135
02:48:20,765 --> 02:48:21,906
[SPEAKER_19]: This is just laughable.

2136
02:48:22,326 --> 02:48:28,248
[SPEAKER_19]: How many people, my orientation for my Photoshop class was, it's an online class, was taught in the Mac Lab.

2137
02:48:28,829 --> 02:48:32,890
[SPEAKER_19]: And it was amazing that half the people were saying, how do I get on to the blackboard?

2138
02:48:33,150 --> 02:48:35,271
[SPEAKER_19]: Because they didn't know where to find Internet Explorer.

2139
02:48:37,032 --> 02:48:38,333
[SPEAKER_19]: I just laughed.

2140
02:48:42,033 --> 02:48:44,735
[SPEAKER_19]: I laughed for a very long time.

2141
02:48:44,795 --> 02:48:50,441
[SPEAKER_19]: My first computer was one of those old Apple 2E tall ones.

2142
02:48:51,161 --> 02:48:54,104
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like, this thing's taller than my head.

2143
02:48:55,245 --> 02:48:59,209
[SPEAKER_17]: Along the playing, where in the world is Carmen Sandiego on those things?

2144
02:49:00,611 --> 02:49:07,175
[SPEAKER_07]: As I was going to say before about the retarded people at the Chinese food place, there was actually someone that was more retarded than the sample lady.

2145
02:49:07,675 --> 02:49:20,121
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was this person, I don't even know who she was, she wasn't even Asian, but I was like, I want the large rice plate, as advertised in this little thing here where it's $4.99.

2146
02:49:20,601 --> 02:49:22,241
[SPEAKER_07]: So what she does, she starts going for the chow mein.

2147
02:49:22,262 --> 02:49:25,263
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, large rice plate, not chow mein!

2148
02:49:26,184 --> 02:49:27,685
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and so she's like, oh!

2149
02:49:28,186 --> 02:49:37,514
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so she gets the rice, and then she doesn't know what she's doing, she keeps asking the Asian people, and they're just like, looking at her funny, like, you don't understand?

2150
02:49:38,314 --> 02:49:39,174
[SPEAKER_07]: You stupid!

2151
02:49:39,835 --> 02:49:42,796
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyways, I finally got my stuff, but man, she was a retard.

2152
02:49:44,156 --> 02:50:06,905
[SPEAKER_07]: And the other thing I was going to mention, which is kind of cool, in two weeks I get to go see the Kings play, even though I'm not a Kings fan, but I won floor tickets to the Kings, and I honestly, I hate the Kings, but we're watching them play the Knicks, and I'm taking my mom because she likes the Kings, and whatever, so...

2153
02:50:07,546 --> 02:50:08,748
[SPEAKER_07]: I get to go sit on the floor.

2154
02:50:10,830 --> 02:50:14,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I hope something cool happens like a meteor hits them and kills them all.

2155
02:50:15,156 --> 02:50:16,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that'd be cool.

2156
02:50:16,778 --> 02:50:18,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Or if one of them has a heart attack or something.

2157
02:50:18,560 --> 02:50:20,482
[SPEAKER_07]: I should bring marbles.

2158
02:50:22,345 --> 02:50:26,530
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if I want to die...

2159
02:50:28,789 --> 02:50:33,170
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we're going to go to a quick break, and when we come back, a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge.

2160
02:50:33,230 --> 02:50:37,111
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a little bit of time for Ask Orange Lounge, or you could ask Mel B, Shark's Girl, or Explicit.

2161
02:50:37,951 --> 02:50:39,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you could ask Nellie.

2162
02:50:39,111 --> 02:50:40,051
[SPEAKER_09]: That doesn't mean she'll answer you.

2163
02:50:40,492 --> 02:50:44,653
[SPEAKER_09]: You can ask... I'm going to ask Nellie.

2164
02:50:45,093 --> 02:50:45,693
[SPEAKER_07]: No, never mind.

2165
02:50:46,673 --> 02:50:47,273
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, anyway.

2166
02:50:47,653 --> 02:50:49,894
[SPEAKER_20]: How much money would it take for you to rape Robin?

2167
02:50:50,714 --> 02:50:51,234
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2168
02:50:51,956 --> 02:50:55,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Ask Orange Lounge when we come back for a little bit, and then we're going to put the nail in the coffin of this show.

2169
02:50:55,821 --> 02:51:01,948
[SPEAKER_09]: In this break, we're going to do a two-song break featuring some requests, some songs that you guys have been requesting all night long.

2170
02:51:01,988 --> 02:51:02,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Here you go.

2171
02:51:02,688 --> 02:51:04,571
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to start it off with a little bit of a ballad.

2172
02:51:05,552 --> 02:51:08,415
[SPEAKER_09]: So get out the lighters and slow dance to this one.

2173
02:51:22,934 --> 02:51:23,635
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2174
02:51:23,655 --> 02:51:24,095
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2175
02:51:47,967 --> 02:51:48,668
Thanks for watching!

2176
02:52:28,924 --> 02:52:29,587
Thanks for watching!

2177
02:53:03,001 --> 02:53:04,122
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

2178
02:54:21,445 --> 02:54:27,251
[SPEAKER_34]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

2179
02:54:32,015 --> 02:54:34,898
[SPEAKER_09]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2180
02:54:38,061 --> 02:54:42,606
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was going to do Ask Orange Lounge, but nobody submitted a question yet.

2181
02:54:42,966 --> 02:54:44,167
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a question.

2182
02:54:44,227 --> 02:54:45,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on, we've got to do the music.

2183
02:54:45,628 --> 02:54:46,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a minute here.

2184
02:54:52,506 --> 02:54:56,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I just put it there in chat, a reminder of how to ask Orange Lounge if you would like.

2185
02:54:56,208 --> 02:54:58,509
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, ask us a question, bitches.

2186
02:54:58,569 --> 02:55:05,072
[SPEAKER_09]: But since we don't have any questions yet, what we'll do is we'll allow somebody in the room to ask other folks in the room a question.

2187
02:55:05,152 --> 02:55:07,353
[SPEAKER_09]: So let me get the theme music so we can play.

2188
02:55:10,094 --> 02:55:10,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go.

2189
02:55:14,076 --> 02:55:14,516
Here we go.

2190
02:55:17,731 --> 02:55:20,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

2191
02:55:21,173 --> 02:55:24,395
[SPEAKER_09]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

2192
02:55:24,815 --> 02:55:26,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Will you rape me in a bus?

2193
02:55:26,676 --> 02:55:28,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Will you rape me in a car?

2194
02:55:28,557 --> 02:55:30,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Will you... Fuck it.

2195
02:55:40,003 --> 02:55:41,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Peralta has a question.

2196
02:55:41,984 --> 02:55:44,806
[SPEAKER_09]: When will you report on Tony Hawk's latest game?

2197
02:55:46,730 --> 02:55:48,571
[SPEAKER_19]: When monkeys fly out of my ass.

2198
02:55:48,591 --> 02:55:52,454
[SPEAKER_09]: When one magically appears on the hard drive of my HD loader.

2199
02:55:52,774 --> 02:55:59,018
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to play The Punisher because you can kill people in hundreds of different ways.

2200
02:56:11,761 --> 02:56:21,223
[SPEAKER_07]: including like taking their jaw, opening it up on a curb and smashing their skull down or throwing them through wood chippers or drill presses or like many other ways.

2201
02:56:21,283 --> 02:56:28,045
[SPEAKER_07]: You can interrogate them over a roof by dangling them by their feet and then you can let them go and like a bunch of other fun stuff like that.

2202
02:56:28,465 --> 02:56:29,865
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like super violent and stuff.

2203
02:56:31,446 --> 02:56:32,826
[SPEAKER_19]: Someone's played my favorite game already.

2204
02:56:33,226 --> 02:56:34,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Peralta has a follow-up question.

2205
02:56:35,707 --> 02:56:37,727
[SPEAKER_09]: When will monkeys be flying out of Jamie's ass?

2206
02:56:39,328 --> 02:56:40,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully never.

2207
02:56:42,475 --> 02:56:50,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, uh, Zerus says, why do so many people hate on my baby, insert parent figure here, my baby mama or my baby daddy?

2208
02:56:51,780 --> 02:56:57,123
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't hate it, I just think we do play that song an awful lot, we're supposed to, you know, that's supposed to be a rainy day song.

2209
02:56:57,403 --> 02:57:04,527
[SPEAKER_19]: We need to do the more politically correct version, you know, uh, my baby non-gender specific parental unit.

2210
02:57:06,409 --> 02:57:07,349
[SPEAKER_09]: My baby parent.

2211
02:57:08,190 --> 02:57:08,990
[SPEAKER_07]: My baby guardian.

2212
02:57:10,638 --> 02:57:14,420
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been reading a lot of those politically correct bedtime stories, those little books.

2213
02:57:16,181 --> 02:57:21,883
[SPEAKER_19]: And so, I was actually spending the other day trying to filk songs to do them politically correct.

2214
02:57:22,783 --> 02:57:23,184
[SPEAKER_16]: It didn't work.

2215
02:57:23,204 --> 02:57:25,004
[SPEAKER_16]: Why does my baby have two mamas?

2216
02:57:25,785 --> 02:57:28,466
[SPEAKER_16]: My baby mamas?

2217
02:57:29,403 --> 02:57:30,243
[SPEAKER_09]: My baby mamas.

2218
02:57:31,183 --> 02:57:31,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

2219
02:57:32,264 --> 02:57:35,704
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to kind of tear through these because suddenly we're getting like eight questions.

2220
02:57:35,764 --> 02:57:36,204
[SPEAKER_09]: It's crazy.

2221
02:57:36,224 --> 02:57:38,485
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've got to burn through these because we've only got a little show left here.

2222
02:57:38,965 --> 02:57:42,045
[SPEAKER_09]: K- wants to know, what is the best way to pick up chicks?

2223
02:57:43,546 --> 02:57:44,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Show them your wallet.

2224
02:57:45,666 --> 02:57:47,046
[SPEAKER_16]: Lift them by the shoulders.

2225
02:57:47,346 --> 02:57:47,926
[SPEAKER_09]: A backhoe.

2226
02:57:49,887 --> 02:57:51,467
[SPEAKER_35]: Tell them you're a great freestyler.

2227
02:57:51,647 --> 02:57:55,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, when he says chicks, he means chicks at DDR Tourneys.

2228
02:57:55,648 --> 02:57:56,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, show them your wallet.

2229
02:57:57,890 --> 02:58:00,772
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, unless they're competing, they're usually there to watch their boyfriends.

2230
02:58:01,652 --> 02:58:03,353
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a barnyard at tournaments?

2231
02:58:03,413 --> 02:58:04,133
[SPEAKER_16]: Little chicks?

2232
02:58:04,494 --> 02:58:06,615
[SPEAKER_16]: Cheep, cheep, cheep, ha, ha, ha.

2233
02:58:06,695 --> 02:58:07,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Boo!

2234
02:58:08,095 --> 02:58:10,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Just kidding.

2235
02:58:11,617 --> 02:58:12,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Do I have any serious advice?

2236
02:58:13,198 --> 02:58:13,678
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

2237
02:58:15,960 --> 02:58:17,040
[SPEAKER_09]: Just go up and say hi.

2238
02:58:17,260 --> 02:58:18,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Girls are impressed with a guy with balls.

2239
02:58:19,121 --> 02:58:19,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Just go up and say hi.

2240
02:58:20,842 --> 02:58:22,283
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't say hi repeatedly.

2241
02:58:22,343 --> 02:58:24,444
[SPEAKER_00]: If she walks away, don't follow her.

2242
02:58:24,464 --> 02:58:25,404
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's stalking.

2243
02:58:27,981 --> 02:58:28,401
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura?

2244
02:58:29,201 --> 02:58:36,644
[SPEAKER_19]: Well... If she just doesn't say anything to you, but doesn't move, maybe she didn't hear you.

2245
02:58:37,484 --> 02:58:38,005
[SPEAKER_09]: That could be.

2246
02:58:38,285 --> 02:58:39,645
[SPEAKER_19]: Or she's pointedly ignoring you.

2247
02:58:39,765 --> 02:58:40,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Or she's deaf.

2248
02:58:40,625 --> 02:58:41,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Or dead.

2249
02:58:41,606 --> 02:58:43,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Or dead.

2250
02:58:43,246 --> 02:58:47,568
[SPEAKER_07]: A DDR tournament is not a good place to talk to women because it's so fucking loud there.

2251
02:58:47,788 --> 02:58:49,369
[SPEAKER_19]: Wait until they go outside.

2252
02:58:50,049 --> 02:58:53,130
[SPEAKER_19]: Casually stand there and go, Oh, hi, I saw you inside.

2253
02:58:53,430 --> 02:58:54,070
[SPEAKER_20]: Whip it out!

2254
02:58:56,914 --> 02:58:57,474
[SPEAKER_19]: Go planet!

2255
02:58:57,554 --> 02:58:58,255
[SPEAKER_19]: Illusion says...

2256
02:59:26,513 --> 02:59:26,953
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell?

2257
02:59:28,655 --> 02:59:33,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Read any good books lately that aren't of the homoerotic variety, a.k.a.

2258
02:59:33,159 --> 02:59:33,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Anne Rice novels?

2259
02:59:34,741 --> 02:59:35,461
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, it's funny.

2260
02:59:35,641 --> 02:59:40,866
[SPEAKER_19]: My bathroom reading right now is an Anne Rice novel.

2261
02:59:40,946 --> 02:59:42,968
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm reading the sequel to Blackwood Farm.

2262
02:59:51,692 --> 02:59:54,975
[SPEAKER_19]: But it's all from Lestat's point of view, which I think he's absolutely hilarious.

2263
02:59:55,635 --> 03:00:02,861
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to know why people are busting up laughing, it's because somebody in chat said, DER attorneys are not a good place to talk to girls because they are probably underage.

2264
03:00:04,142 --> 03:00:07,184
[SPEAKER_09]: Anybody else reading any books they want to share?

2265
03:00:07,504 --> 03:00:09,005
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm reading a book on how to start your own business.

2266
03:00:09,966 --> 03:00:11,627
[SPEAKER_16]: Will Wheaton, just a geek.

2267
03:00:11,727 --> 03:00:14,710
[SPEAKER_16]: He's an awesome author and he's even funnier live.

2268
03:00:14,870 --> 03:00:15,310
[SPEAKER_35]: That's hot.

2269
03:00:16,384 --> 03:00:26,008
[SPEAKER_35]: Dark Knight says, about Mario DDR, if they had no choice but to put a Max 300 style song in it using a Nintendo game song, what would it be?

2270
03:00:26,028 --> 03:00:27,109
[SPEAKER_35]: The Legend of Zelda!

2271
03:00:27,169 --> 03:00:27,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Duh!

2272
03:00:27,249 --> 03:00:27,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Duh!

2273
03:00:47,199 --> 03:00:56,567
[SPEAKER_09]: If real radio makes Captain Jack cry, do pay-based podcasts make Politary make another bad song?

2274
03:00:59,289 --> 03:01:00,690
[SPEAKER_09]: Pay-based podcasts?

2275
03:01:00,810 --> 03:01:01,931
[SPEAKER_09]: That makes me sick.

2276
03:01:02,551 --> 03:01:07,295
[SPEAKER_16]: If a tree falls in the middle of the forest and nobody's around, nobody's still listening to internet radio.

2277
03:01:14,266 --> 03:01:16,068
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember that in Family Guy.

2278
03:01:16,148 --> 03:01:19,752
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, yeah, Phil fell down last week and he hasn't stopped talking about it.

2279
03:01:21,734 --> 03:01:23,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Mikulatov has a question for Loki.

2280
03:01:24,116 --> 03:01:28,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, why did you not include Strangers with Candy, the movie, as one of the must-see movies of the year?

2281
03:01:30,475 --> 03:01:57,295
[SPEAKER_09]: because I had to pick one and you know Sin City was over Strangers with Candy I still want to see Constantine over Sin City I will make Strangers with Candy my must-see movie of the year there you have it I still want to see Constantine Legend of Zaku says out of all the acts from last Tuesday's and Wednesday's American Idol which do you think was the worst act and why?

2282
03:01:57,796 --> 03:01:59,237
[SPEAKER_09]: did anybody actually watch it?

2283
03:02:00,352 --> 03:02:01,672
[SPEAKER_19]: Who in here doesn't watch TV?

2284
03:02:02,533 --> 03:02:03,873
[SPEAKER_09]: My hand is raised.

2285
03:02:04,473 --> 03:02:05,513
[SPEAKER_19]: I watched it.

2286
03:02:06,054 --> 03:02:07,594
[SPEAKER_07]: I was here watching it, remember?

2287
03:02:08,714 --> 03:02:10,235
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the last chick was cool.

2288
03:02:10,815 --> 03:02:12,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Because she was insane.

2289
03:02:13,535 --> 03:02:15,596
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say the guy that was related to Toni Braxton.

2290
03:02:16,156 --> 03:02:16,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Supposedly.

2291
03:02:20,457 --> 03:02:22,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Who was the worst singer on American Idol Tuesday or Wednesday?

2292
03:02:23,178 --> 03:02:27,659
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, it was the crazy girl who had multiple personalities and she had different voices talking to her.

2293
03:02:27,699 --> 03:02:28,379
[SPEAKER_20]: That was hilarious.

2294
03:02:29,847 --> 03:02:33,408
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100 Matt says, Why do only gay guys and not hot girls get turned on by guys playing DDR?

2295
03:02:56,943 --> 03:02:57,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's my answer to that.

2296
03:02:58,023 --> 03:03:03,665
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Murphy's Law in action, because I, being a gay man, I only attract women playing DDR.

2297
03:03:04,605 --> 03:03:06,386
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's just the way life works, buddy.

2298
03:03:06,926 --> 03:03:07,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

2299
03:03:07,926 --> 03:03:10,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Your non-preferred gender is the one that'll start hitting on you.

2300
03:03:10,387 --> 03:03:11,567
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just, life's funny.

2301
03:03:13,247 --> 03:03:15,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it says, Shark's Girl says on the contrary.

2302
03:03:15,868 --> 03:03:17,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if you're a girl, it's different.

2303
03:03:17,709 --> 03:03:22,490
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, if you're a girl and you're playing any video game and you're any good at it, yeah, you get some attention most of the time.

2304
03:03:22,970 --> 03:03:26,091
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh my God, when I worked for Cyber Station...

2305
03:03:27,714 --> 03:03:31,935
[SPEAKER_19]: Walking around with the Pac-Man shirt, playing Tekken 3 back in the day.

2306
03:03:32,395 --> 03:03:34,655
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got boobs and you're good at games!

2307
03:03:34,976 --> 03:03:35,956
[SPEAKER_16]: Marry me now!

2308
03:03:35,976 --> 03:03:37,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and I just kicked your ass.

2309
03:03:38,276 --> 03:03:46,498
[SPEAKER_16]: When I worked at the shark store, wearing a hockey jersey, spouting facts and knowing more than the guys around, um, oh dear god, it was crazy.

2310
03:03:47,358 --> 03:03:52,899
[SPEAKER_19]: What would get to people is when I would accurately predict the next character to come out, because I would follow the Japanese machines.

2311
03:03:53,879 --> 03:03:56,260
[SPEAKER_19]: And actually, they did three characters out of order.

2312
03:03:57,205 --> 03:04:03,590
[SPEAKER_16]: I was playing Star Wars once and I had 10 year old boys that looked like they were about ready to propose marriage to me because I was so good at it.

2313
03:04:04,391 --> 03:04:08,334
[SPEAKER_16]: I would put the cursor where characters were before they were there because I had memorized all the patterns.

2314
03:04:09,214 --> 03:04:11,436
[SPEAKER_20]: Boys don't like it when girls are smarter than they are.

2315
03:04:11,536 --> 03:04:13,157
[SPEAKER_20]: I try to pretend like I'm stupid.

2316
03:04:19,640 --> 03:04:23,262
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's a line that you hit depending on what type of group.

2317
03:04:25,624 --> 03:04:30,567
[SPEAKER_19]: You get the worship in some groups and then you get the other way around in other groups.

2318
03:04:30,587 --> 03:04:31,948
[SPEAKER_19]: It was really bad in Alabama.

2319
03:04:32,788 --> 03:04:39,032
[SPEAKER_19]: I was just glad that my boyfriend at the time was as big of a nerd as I was and liked to drink just as much as I did.

2320
03:04:43,752 --> 03:04:54,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we gotta wrap it up, so one more question, and then we're gonna put the nail in the coffin on Ask Orange Lounge, and I apologize to those of you that were cutting off, we just did the questions in the order we received them, so you were towards the end, sorry guys.

2321
03:04:54,999 --> 03:05:04,144
[SPEAKER_09]: DDR Angel wants to know, if Myst is like 20 years old and still very popular, what do you think DDR or Bramante in general will be at its 20 year old birthday?

2322
03:05:05,265 --> 03:05:05,665
[SPEAKER_35]: 20 years old.

2323
03:05:06,696 --> 03:05:16,845
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it'll be the thing that's going to be on VH1's I Love the Zeros and Hal Sparks is sitting there going, those crazy kids were playing that game with the flashing seizure lights.

2324
03:05:16,985 --> 03:05:19,788
[SPEAKER_16]: And somewhere someone's still going to be raping the bar.

2325
03:05:21,770 --> 03:05:22,150
[SPEAKER_09]: Word.

2326
03:05:22,470 --> 03:05:22,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Word.

2327
03:05:23,760 --> 03:05:26,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, I think that definitely sums it up.

2328
03:05:27,201 --> 03:05:27,801
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura?

2329
03:05:27,821 --> 03:05:31,282
[SPEAKER_19]: I just had this vision of this person 20 years from now.

2330
03:05:32,222 --> 03:05:37,503
[SPEAKER_19]: Waiting until everybody's gone, the lights are out, reaching into their closet and pulling out one of those bars.

2331
03:05:38,223 --> 03:05:45,285
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Orange Lounge Radio Live, this is episode 1048, and you're... And I need a job!

2332
03:05:46,865 --> 03:05:47,225
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2333
03:05:47,625 --> 03:05:48,986
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, our contract just ended for G5.

2334
03:05:51,661 --> 03:05:54,032
[SPEAKER_19]: And you know, we've decided that we're going to go off on our own.

2335
03:05:54,173 --> 03:05:54,936
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to expand.

2336
03:05:55,976 --> 03:06:01,437
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, we just got done buying out 50 companies, and this one we're all uber successful and elitist.

2337
03:06:01,477 --> 03:06:03,818
[SPEAKER_19]: We have people to pretend to be us.

2338
03:06:04,498 --> 03:06:12,660
[SPEAKER_09]: And in the latest ratings book, we just got the latest ratings book, and look, Orange Lounge Radio has beaten G4 Television in the ratings book.

2339
03:06:13,180 --> 03:06:18,402
[SPEAKER_09]: And, oh, it looks like the two guys tickling each other channel on Live 365 also beat G4.

2340
03:06:22,443 --> 03:06:24,063
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, it looks like

2341
03:06:24,699 --> 03:06:31,020
[SPEAKER_10]: G4 came in next to last place and in last place the microphone up a donkey's butt station.

2342
03:06:31,040 --> 03:06:34,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I like that station.

2343
03:06:35,101 --> 03:06:38,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't be dissing the microphone up ass ass station.

2344
03:06:40,542 --> 03:06:40,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

2345
03:06:41,602 --> 03:06:43,403
[SPEAKER_09]: We gotta go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2346
03:06:43,423 --> 03:06:44,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry to those questions we didn't get to.

2347
03:06:45,163 --> 03:06:50,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Explicit, your final thought.

2348
03:06:53,625 --> 03:06:54,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Mel B, your final thought.

2349
03:06:55,208 --> 03:06:56,729
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh man, it's good to be back up in here.

2350
03:06:56,749 --> 03:06:58,610
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so boring, I don't have one.

2351
03:06:58,650 --> 03:06:59,970
[SPEAKER_16]: How much money would it take?

2352
03:06:59,990 --> 03:07:02,852
[SPEAKER_16]: I kid you not, I have seen pictures of a baby soup.

2353
03:07:20,129 --> 03:07:27,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Go to superzooi.com, that's S-U-P-E-R-Z-O-O-I dot com.

2354
03:07:27,455 --> 03:07:33,800
[SPEAKER_07]: In the left-hand column, there will be a picture thing, and click on the one that says Baby Soup, and it actually shows it.

2355
03:07:35,181 --> 03:07:37,382
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is, why is he a co-host?

2356
03:07:38,824 --> 03:07:39,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

2357
03:07:39,684 --> 03:07:40,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Why, why, why?

2358
03:07:40,385 --> 03:07:40,645
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie?

2359
03:07:40,925 --> 03:07:44,088
[SPEAKER_19]: My final thought was because he sat on the floor long enough to yearn to spot...

2360
03:07:46,786 --> 03:07:48,527

03:11:00,097 --> 03:11:09,084
The power to hold the operatic dead inside my mind.

2380
03:12:45,891 --> 03:12:57,979
