1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And as we wind down I-95, yeah, our shadow's taller than our soul.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Hey, there's that lady we all know, she's shining white light and wants to show.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And if you listen very hard That tune will come to you at last

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,000
All for one, one for all Baby, you're rockin' the tune

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I said, roll, roll, roll.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I said, roll.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:01:05,640
And, she's, buying, a stairway!

8
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,140
Agh!

9
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:15,820
Kevin!

10
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,360
And I'm sailing!

11
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,320
Should've been, could've been, would've been dead

12
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,320
If I didn't get the message going to my head

13
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,000
I am what I am

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Most motherfuckers don't give a damn

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,500
Oh baby, think you can

16
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,300
Be my girl, I'll be your man

17
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,200
Someone full of fun, do be tellin' well done

18
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Little woe, keep comin' for my stun gun

19
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,700
Beware, take care

20
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,700
Most motherfuckers have a cold ass snare

21
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,300
Oh baby, please be there

22
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,700
Suck my kiss, cut me my share

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,200
Hit me, you can't hurt me

24
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,700
Suck my kiss

25
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,700
Kiss me, please, pervert me

26
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,200
Stick with this

27
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,200
Is she talking dirty?

28
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,200
Give to me sweet sacred bliss, your milk was made to suck my kiss!

29
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,200
I took her out, it was a Friday night

30
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,200
I walk alone to get the feeling right

31
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,200
We started making out, and she took off my pants

32
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,200
But then I turned on the TV

33
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,200
And that's about the time she walked away from me

34
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,200
Nobody likes you when you're 23

35
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,200
And I'm still more amused by TV shows

36
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,200
What the hell is ad?

37
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,200
My friends say I should act my age

38
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,200
What's my age again?

39
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,200
What's my age again?

40
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:06,600
Then later on, on the drive home, I called her mom from a payphone

41
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,800
I said, I want the cops, and your husband's in jail

42
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:15,080
The state looks down on sodomy And that's about the time that bitch hung

43
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,720
up on me Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three

44
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,320
And I'm still more amused by bank phone calls What the heck is call ID?

45
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,320
My friends say I shit at my age, what's my age again?

46
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,320
What's my age again?

47
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:49,320
Look at those stars, see how they shine for boo

48
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,320
And all the things you do

49
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,320

177
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:33,780
Can I please have your first name only and your birthdate, please?

178
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:38,780
Uh, well, no, I actually just wanted to know what you thought of Orange Lounge Radio.

179
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,780
Alright, go ahead.

180
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:43,780
Well, what do you think of Loki, one of the three hosts of Orange Lounge Radio?

181
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,780
Is he incarcerated?

182
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:48,780
Uh, actually, no he's not, but what do you think of the ever-ranty Dark Sakura?

183
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,780
Hi, dear, how are you?

184
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,780
I love you.

185
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,780
I see you two must know each other. Well, what do you think of Sky?

186
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,780
Did he used to play football when he was in high school?

187
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,780
Well, actually, no he didn't.

188
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,780
Ha ha ha ha!

189
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,780
Well, what do you think of Intern Zero?

190
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:05,780
I want you to really remember the pill, alright?

191
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:11,780
I'm seeing some forgetting, possibly, and I'm seeing a new baby in the next three months.

192
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,780
Right. Okay, well, thanks for being on Orange Lounge Radio today.

193
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:20,780
Um, I don't mean to sidetrack your question here, but who are all of these nosy people,

194
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,780
outside influences I'm seeing around you by the moon card?

195
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,780
Get away from me.

196
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:32,780
Orange Lounge Radio, helping to free your mind and spirit.

197
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:38,080
spirit. I'm Miss Cleo, I love you.

198
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:44,980
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio. Thank you for joining us on this lovely Sunday night.

199
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:50,540
We're here of course every Sunday night for you guys. 6.30 Pacific Standard Time to 9.30

200
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:55,820
Pacific Standard Time. All that discussion on rhythm and music video gaming and video

201
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:02,740
video games that don't suck, and some that do. Join us in our chat room, www.orangelauntrader.com,

202
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:07,060
click on chat. Whatever happened to Intern Zero by the way?

203
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:12,900
I know a whole bunch of crap about him, that I'm not at liberty to speak of, but it involves

204
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,900
legal action.

205
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:19,180
Make up your own story. That could be a contest maybe, right? Your fanfic. Okay, maybe not.

206
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:32,180
He was abducted by aliens and went up with Richard Dreyfuss and then they flew away while Steven Spielberg got rich.

207
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:39,180
Yes, that's it. Anyway, usually we start off the show playing a little bit of how was your week, how was your day.

208
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:44,180
And we're going to get into that in a little bit. However, I did want to kind of make an exception tonight for this.

209
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:48,020
Jamie and I were talking about this a little bit before tonight's show, and we thought

210
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,340
we wanted to take a minute to acknowledge this.

211
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:56,060
If you have had the television on at all today, I'm sure you've heard about this, so we're

212
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:00,300
probably not the first ones to break this news to you, but Johnny Carson, you know,

213
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:05,660
the late night guy that was on for many, many, many years, he passed away today.

214
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:09,140
And we just wanted to take a minute to kind of offer up a moment of silence, because I

215
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:13,940
don't know about you guys, but for me, I think Johnny Carson is an inspiration to any

216
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:20,460
sort of talk program ever. I mean, the guy was absolutely hilarious. He was a comic genius.

217
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:25,180
So many people on his show, so many careers of celebrities that we know today got started

218
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:31,520
all thanks to his help. And I just want to take a minute to acknowledge Mr. Johnny Carson.

219
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:40,520
A moment of silence, please. All right, thank you very much. Anything you want to add to

220
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:48,520
I remember that weird curtain he had. I remember the curtain reappearing in Mallrats.

221
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:54,520
I remember Ed McMahon. I mean, he's still around, but you know, with the chemistry they had.

222
00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:02,520
Anyway, let's move on and onto the usual stuff we have going on on the show here.

223
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:07,520
Dick and fart jokes all night long. No, Jamie, how was your week? How was your day?

224
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,640
My week was absolutely shit.

225
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,360
Not for any type of happy fun reason either.

226
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,960
Um...

227
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,080
Oh, our special guest just arrived!

228
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,840
Hello!

229
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:29,160
It is very a little bit cold outside, isn't it?

230
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,680
Excuse me for a second.

231
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,120
Just so you guys know what's going on, we're just... Oh, say hello!

232
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,760
Mr. Man just picked up the microphone who's getting glomped right now.

233
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:43,440
Oh yeah, it's that guy called Float Walk and he's got something to say later.

234
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,920
Oh, okay. All right. And?

235
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,080
And his faithful traveling companion, Sharks Girl, who always rides.

236
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,200
Hello, Sharks Girl. Hello, how are you?

237
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,120
Hello, hello. I have presents for you.

238
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,640
Yay!

239
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,220
All right. Woohoo. I'm so excited. Anyway.

240
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:06,860
I'm sorry, DarkSakura, we'll get to Mel B and SharksGirl in a minute, but I just wanted

241
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,860
to let you...

242
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,860
Thank you for making me feel special!

243
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:14,460
Well, no, no, no, I just gotta let DarkSakura finish her thought that she was starting with.

244
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:19,260
My week was, well, it started off really good because I started my new position at work

245
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:27,340
on Tuesday, making more money, doing cooler stuff, and not talking to people on the phone.

246
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:34,840
And then, as of Wednesday, I was single for about most of the day, as Lynn literally dumped

247
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,460
that day, yeah.

248
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:44,580
And things have since been repaired, although it's been a very, very, I'm not, of course,

249
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:50,260
it's nobody's real business what happened, but I've been very much on edge for this entire

250
00:21:50,260 --> 00:22:05,180
week. And today has been the first good day of my entire week. It's just... I'm not really

251
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,420
going to go into it. It was really, really hard.

252
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:14,400
It's personal. That's fine. Yeah, but that's really been the entire focus

253
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,120
of my week, although I've played a whole crapload of Castlevania today.

254
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:26,720
one symphony of the night right on and I had two class orientations spent $118 on

255
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,840
art supplies and I still need to buy another 60 more geez what kind of class

256
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:40,320
is this for a concept of art design so yeah I have to buy paint next like

257
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:48,720
watercolors and crap so that's really it for this week so that's why I'm full of

258
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,880
of angst. However, I have rediscovered the joys of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches

259
00:22:53,880 --> 00:23:01,520
made with pineapple jelly.

260
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,180
Shark Scroll is handing out presents. This is awesome. Shark Scroll is giving me her

261
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:14,320
old Queer Eye for the Straight Guy calendar so I can just turn to April and just hang

262
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:21,240
up that picture of Jay. I figured you'd like the picture. Anyway, and then also she brought

263
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,840
me a new Xbox Live headset because my other one broke and it's in pieces, so I can play

264
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,800
Halo again. No one's used to not play Halo with me. We'll have a kill Rob Knight on Halo,

265
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:35,560
that'll be fun. Alright, anyway, moving on. Let's see, Loki, how was your week, how was

266
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:44,800
today. My week involved lots of Final Fantasy XI, and working on... I rejoined that too.

267
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:49,760
Oh yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh. Addict! Addict! Oh, you're not an addict. Oh yeah, sure. We'll

268
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:56,720
cover that later. I'm not an addict. Anyways, then I was working on the orange box at the

269
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,080
moment, and for those who don't know what the orange box is, that's the Xbox case that's

270
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:08,840
going to have a PC in it. And I spent lots of time dremeling today, and now the case

271
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:16,960
is, you know, kind of a shell of an old Xbox now. Most of the parts have been ripped out

272
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,400
of it, and I'm just kind of piecing this together. I bought the rest of the parts today because

273
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:28,120
the hard drive that I had was a laptop hard drive, and it took too much power on the...

274
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:32,180
I don't want to get too technical, but it took too much power than it needed to, so

275
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:39,900
I bought a 160 gig hard drive that's a lot faster that will be replacing it, and I don't

276
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:45,940
know why I need a 160 gig hard drive considering that this, I don't really know what the hell

277
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:50,060
I'm going to put on it, ROMs, but I don't think it can fit 160 gigs of ROMs, that's

278
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,840
a lot.

279
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:58,120
And then, um, what else? Oh! Other than that, um, I had a migraine yesterday and that was

280
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:05,120
lots of fun, and, um, then, oh, that was pretty much it. Yeah.

281
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:15,560
No, I did not plan how the rape Robin was asleep, but there was this guy, but Nellie

282
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:22,140
Nellie said she would try for $100, but she- $50.

283
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:26,460
I was sitting here the other night, we were all sitting around, and Nellie, who is Loki's

284
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:31,020
other half, was just coming up with all these random hypothetical questions, and they all

285
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,420
had to do with raping me.

286
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:41,020
Hey, we're going to get that kid named Jagermeister eventually.

287
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,340
Would you rape him in a boat?

288
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,780
Would you rape him on a float?

289
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,260
Would you rape him near or far?

290
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,540
Would you rape him in a car?

291
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:50,780
But it would be really easy to rape you in your sleep because you sleep a lot on the

292
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,780
couch on your back.

293
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:57,660
And since 70% of male sleep is spent with an erection, I was thinking I'd just like

294
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:01,180
sneak up on him and pull his pants down.

295
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:05,020
And insertion equals rape, so that's like an easy fishing book.

296
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:08,740
Yeah, but the minute you sit on me, I'm gonna go, AHHH!

297
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:12,060
It's in already, so it doesn't matter.

298
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:16,360
Oh my God. You're a sick woman. You're gonna steal my...

299
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,540
I kept... This is the first time we've gotten Nellie to really talk on this show and it's

300
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,620
about raping me.

301
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,460
That's what I do best.

302
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:28,540
And then she's sitting around trying to get Loki. Would you rape Rob

303
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:32,340
for a million dollars? Would you rape Rob

304
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:36,980
for a hundred thousand dollars? Would you rape him for twenty bucks?

305
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:41,180
And a smile. I love her. Would you rape Rob for a Klondike bar?

306
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:49,180
Ooh, Klondike Bar. I love Klondike Bars, but no, no, no.

307
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:56,180
Now the chat room is having their own rhyming contest here.

308
00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:02,180
OrangeLonsRady.com, click on chat. Now Blaze, about me, for a question for Loki here.

309
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:06,180
Would you rape him in the face? Would you rape him any place?

310
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:10,180
Laughter

311
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:14,180
Somewhere Dr. Seuss is crying.

312
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:18,180
But I offered to split the money with you.

313
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:22,180
Because I was going to give 50 to you.

314
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:26,180
Never mind, I was going to get technical and ask, technically what is rape? Does oral sex count as rape?

315
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:30,180
No.

316
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:34,180
Moving on to non-raping subjects, at least I hope. Mel B, how was your week?

317
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:42,180
Uh, there, um, week was a lot of monotony, but then again, when you're working in video games your way, that's really how it goes.

318
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:46,180
Uh, for those who may or may not know, I actually did not work at Konami at the time.

319
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,180
Okay, just reading these ones.

320
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:57,180
I'm sorry. Chat room, stop being funny. Stop. Stop being... Okay, I'll say it.

321
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:06,180
For those that are not into chat, Blaze, the comic genius of Blaze again, can you rape him in the ear? Would you rape him for a beer?

322
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:20,180
Would you rape him like a duck? Would anyone give a fuck? Would you rape him for five bucks? Would you rape him like a duck? Oh jeez, forget it. Chat room, stop being funny! Stop! Stop!

323
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,180
Okay. Sorry, Mel.

324
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:28,180
Yeah, actually instead of being at Konami right now, I'm actually working at Namco, of all places.

325
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:35,180
Which means it's a lot of Pac-Man, and Pac-Man, and Tekken 5.

326
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:40,180
But it's kind of going along, it's a job, everything is kind of interesting.

327
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:47,180
And of course, as with any place I go to, there's that one person who watches me play either DDR or 2DX at work.

328
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:52,420
2DX at work, I usually bring my stuff on break and play user debug stations, and they say,

329
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:56,220
wow, did you work at Konami or test this game? Like, I didn't test this game, but you know,

330
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:00,060
I played before and stuff. Like, wow, you must have played DDR2. I'm like, yeah, I played

331
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:03,420
DDR for a couple years. And he goes, wait a minute, weren't you at that first Metreon

332
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:07,860
tournament? I'm like, yeah. Wait a minute, what's your name again? Uh, Mel. They're like,

333
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:12,500
no way, you're not Mel B. I'm like, yeah. Like, dude, let me see your name badge. I'm

334
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,500
This is at work?

335
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,500
This is at work.

336
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:20,500
Here, guys, like other testers come up to me and like, know me through this stuff and...

337
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,500
Don't you...

338
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,500
You don't have time to be fraternizing on your breaks.

339
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:28,500
Isn't there a new Katamari Damacy game to be testing in Tekken 5 and all that stuff?

340
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,500
Uh, that'll be later this year.

341
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,500
Alright.

342
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,500
How it goes.

343
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,500
But yeah, we have all sorts of goodies over there right now.

344
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,500
We get to see a lot of PSP action out there, actually.

345
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,500
Ooh, very hot.

346
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,500
Yeah, so it's, uh, those things look pretty sexy, I must say.

347
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,500
They look a lot better than what I remember at E3. I remember that much.

348
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:50,500
Is Namco going to be putting anything out on the DS? Because damn the DS needs some games.

349
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,500
Uh, yes there is.

350
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:57,500
Oh yeah, the Pac-Pix thing. Of course. Namco has to whore Pac-Man wherever they can.

351
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:05,500
Mm-hmm. I mean, yeah, basically the two main sounds you hear out of Namco are waka-waka and ee-ree-ree-wak-wak.

352
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,500
Seriously, that's just what I feel like when I walk around like the whole-

353
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,880
When you walk around the Namco building do you actually do a waka waka waka waka waka waka waka?

354
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,060
What?

355
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,060
Do they have dots on the floor?

356
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,260
I think in one of the old rooms that

357
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,860
Because they just moved buildings, but the old building yes

358
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:26,240
There was a room that actually had like a Pac-Man light.

359
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,940
Now at Namco can you have drag days?

360
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,940
And you just all come to work with a bow in your hair?

361
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:37,880
Oh man, they just instituted a dress code out there, so we can't even like you know come in our normal does

362
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,880
Cause we gotta have like collared shirts and we gotta be all prim and proper and...

363
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,880
But yeah.

364
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,880
So yeah, just getting used to the new gig. It's, you know, pretty cool.

365
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,880
Although, you know, after playing a fighting game for eight hours straight it can be tiresome.

366
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,260
or you know when they do something genius like

367
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:10,100
have me play a two-player mode all by myself for eight hours. Yeah I was reading about

368
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,780
that in the LJ, what's up with that?

369
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:16,500
I don't know man, they're just geniuses up there, what can I say?

370
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:20,500
Now I've played two-player versus in fighting games by myself before

371
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:25,940
but that was like to see all the fatalities in Mortal Kombat, okay? Right, I mean if I want to do something like that

372
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:28,740
just put me on practice mode, at least there's some kind of

373
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:33,460
you know, indicator of what you're doing in there, you can actually like practice stuff in practice mode, but

374
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,820
papers

375
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,840
point

376
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,980
but uh... yeah

377
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:41,280
uh... then then the weekend's been pretty you know it's not yesterday was a

378
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,380
pretty horrible day because

379
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,060
i was going to go to work

380
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:48,060
now wake up now because i can't find my car keys on mike

381
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:51,540
but to be going you know i've been so i can just kind of words are searching

382
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,980
replace upside down i'll find it

383
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,580
i can't find my phone to do locked in my car

384
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,700
and so you know

385
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,940
my phone with my car and i didn't have my car keys

386
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:05,100
and so I'm just like really trippin' and then

387
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:09,660
so I don't know how to you know contact anyone or anything and it's like

388
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,180
first I didn't want to you know tell

389
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:16,380
uh... sharks go over here because she knows I'm like the most forgetful person in the world

390
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:20,580
last thing I needed was more you know amp for fuel for her fire and etcetera

391
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,040
and then uh...

392
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,500
it kinda got to the point where

393
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,460
I

394
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:28,580
just kinda said okay screw it I'm just gonna call mobile locksmith and yeah I'm just gonna bite the bullet

395
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,500
etcetera

396
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:34,820
And so what happens is I call the locksmith and he comes on over and he pops my door open

397
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:38,580
and it was gonna cost about like damn near 300 bucks to get a new key because I have

398
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:43,060
like a computer chip in my key that's you know certain to the Camaro series of that

399
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:48,140
year and right when he pops my door open my cell phone goes off and the sharks go and

400
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:53,940
she calls me and says hey I just found your keys right now in my handbag I'm like no way

401
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:58,700
so it was all about impeccable timing that night but I was on edge pretty much that rest

402
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:04,180
of the day and everything else has been pretty chill and today's been just coming up here

403
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:07,580
and of course Orange Lounge is where I be.

404
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,580
Alright and Pixie?

405
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:20,740
Well, to say the least, I spent the majority of my week on vacation in Hayward doing butt

406
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:27,740
ass nothing and driving a truck all day long and, let's see, came back on Thursday night

407
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:34,740
like, dumb ass bogs. What else do we do? Stop bringing goddamn books! Bitch! Now I won't

408
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:44,440
talk to you. But anyways, yeah. Is that the new one? Is that the new one? Like, the one

409
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:50,440
with the Chains of Prometheus stuff in it? I'm sorry. No, I have that one. Nevermind.

410
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:57,440
And, let's see, Saturday... I mean, I've been boring. We haven't been here very often

411
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,440
just because...

412
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,440
Alright fine, give it the victor.

413
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,440
I'm right here!

414
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:14,440
Buy me a bottle of Jagger and give me five bucks in five minutes.

415
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:22,440
Well, Rob, you can open your gift now. This was Angel's idea to give this. Yes, it was.

416
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:29,440
So I could redeem myself because I flaked twice on you when I said I was going to come by. But you have to read the card first.

417
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:36,440
I love gifts. This is great. I think every week should be Bring Sky Gifts Week on Orange Lawn.

418
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,440
It wasn't my okay was. I was like, it wasn't my...

419
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,440
Yeah, it was her idea. She spotted it.

420
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:56,840
spotted it okay fine I love present time oh it's kisses it has a little pig

421
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:04,540

422
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:07,060
You marry me.

423
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,940
Janae just proposed to me.

424
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,940
Yes.

425
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,940
Yes, bitch, I'll marry you.

426
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,940

00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,940
Your ring's in the bag, too.

429
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:25,360

433
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,500
It's rainbow.

00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:47,020

Aww.

446
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:06,020
Oh, by the way, you can double the ring mold as something to put your dick in.

447
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:12,020
Oh, my God.

It's safe sex.

453
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:26,860
That mayonnaise does not have spermicide in it.

454
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:31,060
I like the new microphones.

455
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,900
Oh, I can't wait to go fuck my new rainbow pussy.

I love you.

460
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:48,940
We're just too hardcore for G4TV. That's why we'd never be on there.

461
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:53,940
Okay, anyways.

462
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,940
Our chat room is so lost right now because they're not getting half these references.

463
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:01,940
But that's alright. No styling. Were you done talking about your week and your day?

464
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:04,940
I'm rank six.

465
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:07,940
Are you waving your hand in the air? Waving it like you just don't care?

466
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:11,940
You might get those girls para-pairing.

467
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:15,940
I'll get to that in a minute. You got ranked 6 on Final Fantasy, I'm so proud of you.

468
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:19,940
Oh my, your internet penis is huge!

469
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:23,940
I have 90 days playing in choirs, I have wasted my life.

470
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,940
Jamie, if you would.

471
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:31,940
Addict?

472
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:35,940
You know what, I plan on addicting myself because Ragnarok on Line 2

473
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:39,940
is not yet out, and I need something to play because I miss Ragnarok

474
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:44,660
gonna rock so much but I'm so pissed off at gravity right now I actually spent a

475
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:55,740
whole ten minutes on Final Fantasy 11 yesterday waiting on Rob all right

476
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:01,340
sharks girl I I just I'm sorry I had to revel in the moment there about Jamie

477
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:06,380
actually playing Final Fantasy 11 I had to think about that for a minute all

478
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,380
How was your week? How was your day?

479
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,380
Incredibly boring.

480
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:15,380
I got a new job. I gave my old job two days notice, which made me insanely happy.

481
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:18,380
Because it was very fun watching them all flip out.

482
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:25,380
And then I got a contract at Cisco Systems and they have not come to the realization that,

483
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:28,380
oh, it takes forever for all your passwords to clear and everything.

484
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:34,380
So I've been sitting there chatting online and playing on my sidekick all week and getting paid for it.

485
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:39,380
Maybe tomorrow I'll actually do something. That would be kind of a different change.

486
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:10,440

00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:58,620
we're gonna be getting in the games business, so that means I can get an E3 using VPD now

493
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,240
and uh...

494
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,340
also um...

495
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,880
hopefully get some free demos

496
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,200
yay demos

497
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:12,200
shark stroll were you done with your thought before loki so rudely interrupted you

498
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:16,120
I'm boring this week so

499
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,240
the week before was the more entertaining one but

500
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,040
yeah I'm bored

501
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,400
any highlights you want to share from that week?

502
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,040
I interviewed for the job I'm at now on monday

503
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:30,600
on the phone. I interviewed in person on Wednesday at 9. I found out I had the job at 1

504
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:35,720
and got in a car accident at 120. You have this insane luck with car accidents

505
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:39,160
when you do new exciting things. $1,584 fucking dollars

506
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:43,120
to fix a bumper and a back quarter panel. That's crap.

507
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:47,640
That sucks. Luckily, my insurance covered all but 250 of it.

508
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:51,520
That's decent. And I might get 125 back if I can convince

509
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:55,080
Geico that because I'm backing out doesn't mean that I have a greater duty of

510
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:58,160
care to watch that I don't hit him considering he was backing out too I

511
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:07,880
don't get that one why it's more my fault because you're a woman which

512
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:12,800
improves the point that a new women can't run stop you're gonna get in

513
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:22,480
trouble thank you by the way sharks girl for all these tapes I'm getting this is

514
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,960
the entire surreal life season three I got on tape and then the entire first

515
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:31,000
part of I love the 90s and I just tivo the entire second part of I love the

516
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,640
90s and you'll be getting that and probably that's hot season three flavor

517
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:47,940
Flava Flav and Dave Couleé and Brigitte Nielsen and Charo and Brian Starr. Oh, and Jordan

518
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:48,940
Knight.

519
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:54,720
What else is there? Oh, so you've been doing nothing but playing on your sidekick at work

520
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,320
this week. Does Snoop do his own laundry?

521
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,320
Huh?

522
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,480
Does Snoop do his own laundry?

523
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,480
Yeah.

524
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,960
yeah

525
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,640
all right did you have a comment

526
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,940
are you just waiting at the camera no style

527
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:11,160
if you want to see the webcam dubbed up dot or is already dot com

528
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,040
uh... moving on it's my turn damage

529
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,280
i want to take a turn i know we still got angel left to go but

530
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,440
uh...

531
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:25,960
i've got something to say

532
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,620
anyway

533
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:32,500
My week of my day was okay. I did a whole lot of nothing this week, really.

534
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:38,060
I played a lot of Final Fantasy XI, just like, you know, my buddy Loki here and

535
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:41,420
no styling. Last night, though, was very cool. Last night, my buddy,

536
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:44,340
and they're listening right now, actually, my buddy and his roommate threw a little

537
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:50,480
dinner party, and I got really drunk. No kidding. I did 20 shots last night,

538
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:55,580
about. And you guys know what a freaking lightweight I am.

539
00:43:55,580 --> 00:44:15,580
Did you pass out and they put a funnel in your mouth and then they shot the shots down for you?

540
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:16,580
Did that happen?

541
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:19,580
You were always falling asleep on the floor.

542
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,580
I fell asleep on the floor like three times in my house.

543
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:25,700
everybody was doing shots together I was just the biggest pussy with the lowest

544
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:29,660
alcohol tolerance and so everybody else is still coherent but then like I'd be

545
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:30,580
like kinda like

546
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:33,740
slumping on the table going I need to cut myself off

547
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:40,740
and then they'll put another one in front of me and I'll be all okay and drink it

548
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:50,460
no thankfully pixie dust is not at the party so nobody was putting makeup on me

549
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:51,260
make me look pretty

550
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:54,900
at least you weren't like Vern Troyer in the first episode of surreal life season 4, because

551
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,600
he was naked and pissing in the corner of the weight room.

552
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,420
I was however going, egh, egh, egh, egh, egh, egh, egh, egh.

553
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:07,380
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

554
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:11,780
Alright, enough talking about VH1's shows.

555
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:15,780
Look at that, they're sitting there in the chat room right now and one of my buddies

556
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:19,160
that was there last night says, yeah, we shaved his ass.

557
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,160
Huh.

558
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,160
Interesting.

559
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:24,840
Do I check it this morning?

560
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,580
You want to come inspect it?

561
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:28,580
Get the flashlight.

562
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:29,580
It's pretty cavernous.

563
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:30,580
Alright.

564
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:31,580
Uh.

565
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:32,580
DDR Angel.

566
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:33,580
Last but certainly not least.

567
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:34,580
How was your week?

568
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:35,580
How was your day?

569
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:36,580
Well let's see.

570
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:37,580
Uh.

571
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:44,540
Classes started this week and normally I'd probably be going uhhh but no.

572
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:48,760
Actually I, scarily enough I enjoyed myself this week.

573
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:49,760
That's a little scary.

574
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:58,880
being enjoyable okay anyway um yeah other than that uh just like everyone

575
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:06,760
else Final Fantasy 11 and Jamie waiting waiting wait no I'm not gonna say it

576
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:13,960
anymore okay um and actually I actually split myself between three games now so

577
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:25,960
So, it's now Final Fantasy XI there, and I've gotten back into Myst. Help. Ah, Myst. Nobody cares about that in this area.

578
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:29,960
Isn't Myst like 15 years old that game? It's older than God.

579
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,960
Of course, but I had to start-

580
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,960
Yeah, God 16.

581
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,960
I'm not going to comment that I have it for Saturn.

582
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:45,400
cool um yeah I never got to really like get to play that game so they came out

583
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:50,760
with a DVD version a little while back so I have all three of those there you

584
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:55,120
know the first three in the series and then I got the complete Chronicles which

585
00:46:55,120 --> 00:47:04,560
is like a little offshoot of the series as well so I have too many games to play

586
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:11,560
play and school to deal with, and that's okay. Final Fantasy XI tomorrow, yeah. Or tonight.

587
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:15,920
I beat it last week. What? What? You can't beat Final Fantasy XI, the game is unbeatable.

588
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,000
At least you can, the original Final Fantasy XI. You can beat the storyline, I played the

589
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,320
storyline. Oh, okay, okay. That was fun. I gotcha. And I watched all of it. Uh-huh. On

590
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:28,560
the dayward, laying on the bed. Moving on, they can't hear you dear, they can't hear

591
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:34,200
you. I spent it laying on the bed watching my boyfriend play Final Fantasy XI. How depressing

592
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,480
is that

593
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:41,760
for my vacation. Were you at least giving him head? The majority of my vacation was

594
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,680
sucked into Final Fantasy 11. Were you giving him head while he was doing it?

595
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:50,200
Nah, the table's too small. Oh, whoa, hey, ho, ho, hello.

596
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,040
I hit my head. I know. Alright.

597
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:57,600
Alright. Wow.

598
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:01,760
Moving on, we're going to go to a break, I think, and in this break,

599
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,880
Now, when we were in that last break there, the chat room was starting to go,

600
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:09,320
you guys play these songs all the time, can't you play,

601
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,960
play some songs we don't ever hear, what, what's wrong with you guys?

602
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,560
Play some new songs! Fine. So I'm digging into the

603
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,120
obscure stuff, the stuff we don't really play a whole lot, and I'm gonna try and

604
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:20,920
play some

605
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:25,120
new stuff that we don't play on Orange Longest Radio a whole lot. Okay.

606
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:28,920
What we do, but see, we play that one a bit. I, I, I can do that in a later break, but I gotta do

607
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:29,920
stuff we like, I, I,

608
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,560
that jumps out at me saying we don't really play this. Dig into the bowels of like 2DX substreams.

609
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:38,480
I'm gonna dig into the bowels here, but what I have queued up right now, I have

610
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,840
the bonus stage from the newest Taiko no Tatujin in Japan. Now I know we've never

611
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,040
played that one because Navi just sent it to me this week.

612
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,960
It's called Koibumi 2000. We're gonna play that.

613
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,320
And then we have from 2DX Red. I know a lot of folks have heard this, but we

614
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,240
haven't played this song on Orange Lounge Radio,

615
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:58,600
and it has the word fuck in it, so I have to play it. So listen carefully.

616
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:02,600
But it goes, you have to listen carefully because it goes fook me.

617
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:06,600
And it's called Injection of Love. And then we're going to play something,

618
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,600
I'm going to play some like old ass Five Key song as well.

619
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:14,600
So we will be back after this with some rare music

620
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:18,600
stuff and we'll be back with more Orange Launch Radio after this.

621
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:28,600
This is the end of the video, thank you for watching and see you in the next video.

622
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:25,600
What are you telling me, me to let you go You want it, you want it, you want it

623
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:52,400
Don't fear, since you're running out.

624
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,700
They will kill you

625
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:58,380
But I won't child.

626
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:04,680
I won't take you anymore.

627
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:07,960
hearts

628
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,840
words

629
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:13,900
family

630
00:52:13,900 --> 00:51:58,480
and

631
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:16,240
special

632
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,240
Oh

633
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,240
Oh

634
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:44,240
So that's why the orange paddle, this video stops, hollers, stop, stop, stop, stop, hollers,

635
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:52,560
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio and oh my lord there's a gazillion people in the

636
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:59,500
house now. I think somewhere during that break explicit showed up and Rice Princess and Lanky

637
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:04,760
Style from Thursday Nights Outside the Box showed up as well. Holy crap there's a lot

638
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:08,200
of people here. So I guess we might as well continue with the how was your week, how was

639
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:13,040
your day bit real fast for the people that just got here. Lanky Style, how was your week,

640
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:21,000
how was your day? Same as always. Worked, slaved over the phone. Working for the devil.

641
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:26,600
I hear that. Rice Princess, how was your week, how was your day? She said pretty good. That's

642
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:34,080
a nod off. Uhh, explicit? It's pretty good. Just getting some more replies with the tournament

643
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:41,320
and actually sending applications on PI for those who cannot pre-register online and stuff.

644
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:45,320
I just got off of CCL to see what new arcades they have gotten.

645
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:49,320
Of course, everyone knows they have 6-style there.

646
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:53,320
And they're replacing one of the DDR machines with the In The Groove machine.

647
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:57,320
Wait, what? What? They have 6-style at CCL?

648
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:01,320
No, it's just B-Mania 3. Oh, B-Mania 3. Yeah, I'd heard about that.

649
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:05,320
Not 2DX.

650
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:09,320
You know how crowded that's going to be in CCL.

651
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,320
Alright.

652
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:13,320
The rest will be held in my FUs.

653
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,320
Oh goody goody. Alright.

654
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:21,320
Moving on. Um, wow guys. Well what can I say in studio here. There's what, like 11 people here? Pull up a floor.

655
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:25,320
Please try not to fart in studio. We'd appreciate that.

656
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:35,320
Moving on, I noticed Loki's over on our webcam there at www.orangelandtray.com and he's holding up pieces of this modified Xbox.

657
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:38,600
Tell us, for the listeners that haven't heard about what you're doing here with this Xbox,

658
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,880
tell us about this little project that you've picked up low-key about modifying an Xbox.

659
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:46,280
Well, it's not really modifying an Xbox. It's merely just a PC that's going inside of an

660
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:52,240
Xbox case. It's a micro-ITX PC, which, for those who don't know what those are, they're

661
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:59,840
really small form factor PC motherboards. They're 17 centimeters by 17 centimeters.

662
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:04,080
Usually they're fanless, but this one being a 1 gigahertz processor is not fanless, but

663
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:10,280
They're really fucking small, so you're able to put them in the really small cases, like

664
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:16,400
the Xbox case here, so it's actually going to have, the way I have it working right now

665
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:22,080
is it's actually going to run all off a battery. So it's going to be 100% portable. For a monitor,

666
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:32,080
I'm actually using a portable PlayStation PS1 LCD screen that's 5 inches. All going

667
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:39,040
gonna be portable though completely 100% nerd hey it's this force so we can you

668
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:45,600
know do our you know Orange Lawn's radio to go editions from the road from e3 oh

00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:49,000
I'm so glad you brought up Orange Lawn's radio to go it's a brand new thing on

671
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:57,880
very special show that we do every week just for you guys speaking of nerd I

672
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:03,640
I want to point this out. I'm looking in studio right now and I see one, two, three, four

673
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:12,720
people playing Nintendo DS. Nerds! Hey, I'm pictochatting with someone sitting right next

674
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:17,440
to me. Nerds! You know what, I'd be playing DS too, but I left it at my buddy's house.

675
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:27,400
Whoops, in my jacket. Shame on you. Oh well. Anyway, um, moving on, I want to get to some

676
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:33,680
actual DDR news, you guys. Actual news about a really big rhythm music game going on right

677
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:37,780
now. As we talked about a couple weeks ago, there's going to be a brand new DDR game coming

678
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:43,380
out on the GameCube and it's called DDR with Mario. And we knew that we were going to be

679
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:47,600
getting some more information on this game after the Tokyo, what was it, the Tokyo Hobby

680
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:52,280
Fair or something like that that just took place very recently. I screwed up the name

681
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:57,720
probably. So anyway, this Tokyo Fair just happened, and not only did we get a lot more

682
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:03,060
information about this game, we got videos. So I'm gonna show some videos in studio right

683
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:06,880
now, and for those of you on stream, I know this makes for really great radio, but for

684
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:11,200
those of you on stream, you can actually listen to this over the stream. We'll be playing

685
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:15,000
this for you guys, and what's really cool is that you can actually hear some of the

686
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:21,000
music that's gonna be in DDR Mario through this. So I'm gonna play this, and this first

687
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:26,000
This video should be a song that you guys really recognize, at least I hope so.

688
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:32,000
And if you want to check out these videos for yourself, just head on over to www.orangelaungeradio.com

689
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:37,000
and click on the news story that we posted earlier about this.

690
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
By the way, thank Dan for those.

691
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Oh, did he find those?

692
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Dan found those for me last night.

693
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Very nice.

694
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:52,000
By the way, if anybody happens to have an IGN insider account, please let us know because we need your assistance.

695
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Alright, okay here's one video and listen carefully for the song that's playing in the background. It sounds very familiar.

696
01:00:52,000 --> 01:01:00,040
Now, I want to point this out in the video. Let me turn this down a little bit, so you

697
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:04,640
guys can hear the song. In the video, you'll notice that some of the arrows are actually

698
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:11,440
pictures of Boo, the little Boo. And when you step on that, it makes this giant ghost

699
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:15,720
appear on your opponent's side that blocks the arrows. So they're incorporating some

700
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:26,240
of the versus mode stuff in it.

701
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:32,080
Very interesting there, because you notice that the DDR Max announcer was in that perfect,

702
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:38,520
you know, all that stuff, very, I don't know if it's Thomas Howard, I don't know, maybe.

703
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:43,240
The lady's voice in the background we think is just at the show, we don't think it's actually

704
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,240
a part of the game.

705
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:47,720
the show but that you could probably hear it in the background that medley

706
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:50,920
displaying you knew that this would happen in a DDR Mario game it's a dance

707
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:59,920
version of the Mario Brothers theme from Super Mario 2 or USA first

708
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:05,400
stage yep so very interesting there now this next one is very interesting I want

709
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:09,520
to show you this one the last clip it's clip number four this is one of my

710
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:13,400
favorites because they actually have Mario and Luigi dancing in it but this

711
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:17,920
This will allow you to hear one of the other songs that's in the game, and kind of get

712
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:21,900
a little hint of the gameplay, because you'll notice the arrows aren't only just replaced

713
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:25,980
with the boos, but they also have the Goombas and the Koopa Troopas.

714
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:26,980
Very interesting.

715
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:27,980
Very Nintendo-fied, this game.

716
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:30,040
We're going to talk about it a little more here in a minute.

717
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:35,560
Let me get this other clip cued up here, and we'll watch it in studio, and you guys can

718
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:42,560
hear a clip of the song that's going to be in DDR with Mario.

719
01:02:42,560 --> 01:03:09,400
And in this video they have Para Para girls doing a routine to the song.

720
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:20,600
And they have girls caraparing to a basic song on DDR Mario here.

721
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:26,960
And male DDR fans everywhere have a new masturbatory video to watch.

722
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:37,280
I just want to point out though, look how Mario dances.

723
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:49,280
Look at Luigi, he's making waves, he's doing the Watusi.

724
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:51,280
See, there's a Koopa Troopa that just went up.

725
01:03:51,280 --> 01:04:20,960
I'm rather impressed that they can pat-a-pat on this too.

726
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:26,960
very interesting now I realize you guys at home listening right now can't really

727
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:31,120
see what we're watching but you can get the videos on the website it's got to be

728
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:34,800
interesting also to hear the songs there but what do you guys think now that

729
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:38,000
you've seen a little bit of DDR Mario in action hold on let me tell you guys a

730
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,840
little bit more information about this game going on basically what's going on

731
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:47,360
is that they only were able to check out a demo version of course naturally at

732
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:58,680
at the Tokyo World Hobby Fair, they were only able to have a little mini version of the

733
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:03,120
game, and here's what the mini version featured, is that it kind of featured only the two player

734
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:07,680
mode, and Mario and Luigi were the only playable characters in it, and there were only about

735
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:08,680
seven songs.

736
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:13,320
And it does talk about that Goomba and Koopa show up as special icons.

737
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:17,540
When you see a Goomba icon, if you tap the appropriate space on the dance pad, it smashes

738
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:18,540
it.

739
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:22,560
If you smash a Koopa twice, you'll send it flying back down the column, and it'll knock

740
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:25,540
out all the other arrows in the column.

741
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:30,020
So they've come up with all these interesting little, very Nintendo-like things, and then

742
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:33,220
the boo, if you step on the boo, it makes the ghost bigger on the other side, and it

743
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:34,220
hides the arrows.

744
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:38,020
And then of course, there's a little picture of the dance mat here.

745
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:39,020
Very interesting.

746
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:44,140
I'm going to head on over to DDRFreak because I know on the thread there over DDRFreak they

747
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:46,540
were talking about some of the songs that are actually going to be in it.

748
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:51,460
Of course, you heard there the song from Super Mario Brothers Part II, Stage 1 in it.

749
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:53,140
What do you guys think after seeing some of those videos?

750
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:56,260
Jamie, you were the one that showed me these videos in the first place, what do you think?

751
01:05:56,260 --> 01:05:58,940
I think it's adorable.

752
01:05:58,940 --> 01:06:02,780
I think it's cool watching them do the cute little dances and turning around.

753
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:03,780
And then the big boo.

754
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:08,340
It had the big boo, and I love the big boo.

755
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:12,620
I'm quoting from a post here from Unknown Gamer over on DDR Freak.

756
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:15,800
It's post number 202 in the GameCube DDR thread.

757
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:19,580
And they're saying some of the songs that they've translated.

758
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:23,580
Let's see, we have Here We Go from Super Mario Brothers, Hoppin' Choppin' from Super Mario

759
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:29,540
Brothers USA, and then look at this, Para Para Carmen, like the opera Carmen.

760
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:30,540
That's wrong.

761
01:06:30,540 --> 01:06:31,540
A Para Para version.

762
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:38,020
Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Mozart in the Pipe, Then Go the U, A Small Night's Music.

763
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:43,180
That's the name of the song, then go the pipe.

764
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:47,060
Credit there to Unknown Gamer over at DDRFreak for translating some of those and putting

765
01:06:47,060 --> 01:06:48,440
them in a post there.

766
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:50,180
You know my thoughts on this?

767
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:51,180
Well, I'll get to my thoughts.

768
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:52,180
I want to hear you guys.

769
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:53,180
I've talked enough.

770
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:54,180
Likey style.

771
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:56,460
I just want to know if there's going to be like a mushroom icon.

772
01:06:56,460 --> 01:07:00,140
If you step on that, it gives like a hallucinogenic effect to the other player or something, you

773
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:01,140
know?

774
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:05,660
I think the whole game seems like a big hallucinogenic effect.

775
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:10,660
Well, what would you expect, though, from this DDR with Mario, honestly?

776
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:19,660
I think it looks fun. I mean, it'd be interesting to, I think mainly the big thing for me is

777
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:24,660
just the music, you know, see what they're going to do with the Nintendo tunes. I think

778
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:28,660
they should have, like, a secret, like, other Nintendo characters thing in there, too, though.

779
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:31,660
Like, you know, you got Samus, and you get Samus music.

780
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:32,660
Samus Samus music?

781
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:36,660
Yeah dude, the Samus Shuffle, I don't know.

782
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:38,660
Oh dude, the Morph Ball.

783
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:41,660
The Morph Ball Slide, I don't know.

784
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:44,660
How about Mel, Mel B?

785
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:47,660
You've got to admit that Power Power Freestyle was pretty hot.

786
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:56,660
Yeah, I must say it reinforces my belief that pretty much Power Power is a female thing and it only looks good that way.

787
01:07:56,660 --> 01:08:02,660
That said, I mean, looking at the gameplay and stuff, it reminds me a lot of basically just Disney Rave magic on crack.

788
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:09,660
Which, you know, is a cool thing. It's like, one of those concepts that Ultramix 2, you know, kind of tried to do with its battle mode and like other gimmicks.

789
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:14,660
This one kind of takes it to a more, I guess, recognizable form, which is kind of cool.

790
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:19,660
I, it's kind of neat to see the music that, even to hear, you know, what I heard as far as music-wise.

791
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:27,660
But, hypothetically, if this comes out to say, you know, to a stateside release, I can't see it doing a whole lot better, you know.

792
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:34,660
It's sort of like, you know, just the GameCube phenomenon, they just came a couple years way too late for something like this.

793
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:42,660
You know, I don't know though, me personally, I will buy this thing in a heartbeat, because it's total, it's total the stoner DDR, as somebody said in the chat room, no.

794
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:51,660
I mean, if you're into DDR and you just want to see something different, you're going to buy it just on that principle, but once you get past that...

795
01:08:51,660 --> 01:09:00,660
That's what I think is so cool, because there's been a lot of talk, and this got a lot of resistance in the DDR scene at first, when UltraMix 1 first came out.

796
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:06,660
It was really trying to separate itself from the rest of DDR, from the Japanese import DDR that we know.

797
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:12,100
And then so now you've got these real distinct separations between PlayStation 2, you've got itoy,

798
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:17,700
full screen videos, and a lot of that stuff that you see. And then you move over to Ultramix,

799
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:25,100
you've got the synth pop music, you've got downloadable packs, online play, and now GameCube has its own version of DDR. It's

800
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:30,660
Mario Horde, basically, but no, you know this is going to be the minigame king.

801
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:41,660
It does have potential though, so, hey, you never know.

802
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:45,660
Yeah, I thought it was really cool. I would probably be one of those people that would be like,

803
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:50,660
Ooh, I'm still getting that. Just because it's DDR and it's cute and whatever.

804
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:54,660
Did you say one of the songs was called Moats? Moats are on the pipe?

805
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:55,660
Something like that.

806
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:57,660
Stoner DDR is right, yeah.

807
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:59,660
I didn't know Marion Barry was Mozart.

808
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:34,660
I don't mean gayest in butt sex, I mean gayest in happy!

809
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:39,340
Okay Eminem.

810
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:43,020
I mean look at Disney Rave, especially like the U.S. one, Disney Mix.

811
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:46,700
Dude, you can't pick that up anywhere for under like a hundred and thirty bucks.

812
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:49,420
Oh my god. Yeah, check eBay.

813
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:54,140
I found it at Network Video for cheap. Did you get the Japanese or the American one?

814
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:56,140
The American one is the one that's going from-

815
01:10:56,140 --> 01:11:00,140
Oh, I'm talking about the one on the Nintendo 64.

816
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:01,140
Oh, that one.

817
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:03,140
But I have both of them, anyway.

818
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:05,140
Yeah, well, so does Mel. You know, it's no big deal.

819
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:10,140
But, you know, it's like, people like different things, and they like the cute Mario Luigi.

820
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:12,140
It'll sell. Plus, it's a good way-

821
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:14,140
Everyone's always complaining about the exercise factor.

822
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:17,140
All the kids in America are so fat and everything.

823
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:20,140
This is a good way to get the younger ones playing DDR, which we all know is great exercise.

824
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:23,140
Because we all know the kids of America want to be just like Mario.

825
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:30,140
That's right! It's the me!

826
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:34,140
I just, I really hope Princess Peach is an unlockable character.

827
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:38,140
If, in fact, this is my letter to Nintendo.

828
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:41,140
Dear Nintendo,

829
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:47,140
In the upcoming game, DDR with Mario, I hereby request that Princess Peach be a playable character.

830
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:51,140
If this is to be the case, I will play your game every day.

831
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,140
Drunk off my ass. Naked.

832
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:30,140
If the only reason you want Princess Peach in DDR is for an upskirt cam, you get that in Super Smash Brothers Melee, my friend.

833
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:37,140
And may I also say it sucks trying to play DDR in platform boots. Been there, done that, failed.

834
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:43,140
Actually, my first time on a DDR machine was in somebody else's broken in combat boots.

835
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:46,120
Was it I was cosplaying as Jill Valentine from Resident Evil

836
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:52,900
That was that was pain utter and complete pain

837
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:56,660
One of my first times on a DDR machine, especially alone

838
01:12:56,660 --> 01:13:03,260
I was wearing four inch heels with two and a half inch platform booth and I failed butterfly basic I sucked

839
01:13:04,660 --> 01:13:09,100
Can't say I've ever played with platform shoes or high heels. Thank goodness. I

840
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:13,100
I wish I could say the same, but no, I'm kidding, I haven't.

841
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:15,100
Oh wait, Dr. Dick, huh?

842
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:17,100
Aha! You funny.

843
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:20,100
Hey Rob, I can lend you the boots, I still got them.

844
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:21,100
Hey!

845
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:22,100
Rob?

846
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:23,100
Yes?

847
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:25,100
Are you guys still doing comments?

848
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:29,100
Yes, Mario, what do you want to say about DDR Mario exclusive?

849
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:35,100
Well, I think it's a very good concept. Of course, like everyone says, anything Mario and Luigi would sell, in a way.

850
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:41,100
in a way. And with the new DDR pads for like, the GameCube, who knows what they'll do with Mario Party 7, maybe?

851
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:51,100
Oh, God. Mario Party 7, I didn't even think about that. What's gonna be the asinine peripheral that's gonna go with Mario Party 7? Probably this.

852
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:56,100
Have you seriously played Mario Party 6 with a microphone?

853
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,100
Yes.

854
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:59,100
Move up.

855
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:01,100
Goomba.

856
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:03,100
Goomba, Mario Party!

857
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:12,100
And then you have to go faster, faster, faster, faster, faster, faster, faster!

858
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:15,100
Mario Party! Mario Party! Mario Party!

859
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:19,100
This is seriously what playing Mario Party 6 sounds like.

860
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:25,100
Oh my gosh.

861
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:36,780
I know anyways but since I like doggy Konga became like a good a pretty decent

862
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:41,060
success seller I think it would this would sell pretty well I wonder whether

863
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:44,180
I could do with like some of the features maybe a Cooper's shell during

864
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:48,080
while playing the game and potentially lose health maybe sort of like mines

865
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:53,180
but it's that mania in a way or if they play a damn hard song they actually

866
01:14:53,180 --> 01:15:07,540
consider pipe raping or so pipe raping what the hell all right moving on I

867
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:10,500
think we're gonna go to a break when we come back from this break we're gonna do

868
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:13,720
a little more news and then the orange lounge radio cage match when we come

869
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:19,100
back um you know what I just realized I don't I lost all my pop music nine

870
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:22,040
consumer tracks so I got my new hard drive so I don't have that song you

871
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:23,040
That's crappy.

872
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:25,200
I'm sorry, is there something else you wanted to hear, darling?

873
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:26,200
The safari.

874
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:27,560
Okay, you got it.

875
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,280
The safari.

876
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:33,920
We'll be back after this break, featuring, starting it off with the safari, and we'll

877
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:36,720
be back with the Orange Launch Radio cage match, etc., etc.

878
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:41,560
Remember, if you want to participate in tonight's cage match, you gotta be in the chat room,

879
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:43,160
or else it just sucks to be you.

880
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:50,160
We'll be back with more Orange Laundrio.

881
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:41,160
Here's the latest, here's the greatest Here's the meaning for the world

882
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:44,240
Surf on Fire Ghosts on Fire

883
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:47,240
Surf to death the magic words

884
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:50,120
You can do it today

885
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:52,820
you can do it, you can do it the wrong way

886
01:17:53,780 --> 01:17:55,480
Even if you will say

887
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:58,420
Even if you decide to play the game

888
01:17:58,420 --> 01:17:59,740
Go on to Heaven

889
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:01,980
Burn the repeating

890
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:03,840
WWW

891
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:04,860
Dot Dev Dot work

892
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:07,260
Dot go

893
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:08,880
Dog my name

894
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,460
And you'll be as one of there for you

895
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:12,960
I'll never feel alone

896
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:15,960
W-W-W

897
01:18:16,460 --> 01:18:18,960
Got-got-got-got-got

898
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:21,960
Probably I'll be-come to you

899
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:23,960
Oh

900
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:23,960
Oh

901
01:21:51,960 --> 01:22:17,640
So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us at Mookawky Orange Lounge Radio.

902
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:21,240
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

903
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:30,240
Thanks for tuning in tonight boys and girls. Great turnout. Thank you guys. We love it when our ratings get hoarded up. Not only in studio but online as well.

904
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:42,240
I think we broke a record in the chat room with well over 40 people in chat. Pretty crazy. And then we got more people in here than I've seen in a long time. This is great. Thank you guys very much.

905
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:46,720
We're going to go ahead and open up the Skype line right now if you want to call in to the

906
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:47,720
show.

907
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:53,360
If you are curious about how you use the Skype line, head on over to www.orangelaungeradio.com,

908
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:57,400
click on interact with us, and that'll show you how you can interact with the show.

909
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:02,360
Now I gotta warn you guys though, I think there might be some issues with the Skype

910
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:05,240
line tonight, so we're going to kind of play it on the fly.

911
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:09,400
Because I did make some changes to my computer this week, I think there might be some echoes

912
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:13,320
when you guys are talking on Skype, and if there is, I apologize, we'll just see what

913
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:17,520
happens. We're just going to wing it and try taking a call and see what happens. Hi, you're

914
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:23,100
on Orange Launch Radio! It's me, Legend of Zaku. Hello, it's me, Legend of Zaku, how

915
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:29,320
are you? Fine, uh, I don't know, in two days we're about to see the new, the new Dancing

916
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:33,100
Stage Fusion, so I wonder how, how big is the, you know, the coverage on that going

917
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:37,680
to be, because we're going to find out this new hardware and everything about it. Well,

918
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:41,560
Dancing Stage Fusion, well you know, very good point you're bringing up, Dancing Stage Fusion is

919
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:45,280
supposedly gonna be out this week, so, or we're supposed to get,

920
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:48,480
or, no, it's not that it's out, but we get to see it at some expo.

921
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:52,760
Tuesday should be, is gonna be, you know, is gonna be debuted in Tuesday in London.

922
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:56,920
Right, it's gonna be at that show, right? I was just checking out the boards,

923
01:23:56,920 --> 01:24:00,520
I mean, I was just checking out the Freak right there, and there's only like a few

924
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:01,960
people that are actually going.

925
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:05,880
I know one of the mods basically couldn't go that day, but, you know, that's about it.

926
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:10,160
You know what? Here's how it works though, Zaku, seriously.

927
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:15,040
If one person goes, and one person goes, and one person takes a camera with them,

928
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:18,000
that's all it takes for this to get all over the internet. And you know some of

929
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,720
the big gaming sites are going to be there.

930
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:22,840
I would say any news...

931
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:25,880
I doubt Myst and DDR UK would know it would be...

932
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:31,000
Well, DDR UK is in a bit of trouble right now, so you're not going to be...

933
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,880
I'm not going to say you're not going to hear anything from them because I

934
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:36,440
I really don't know. I don't run that site. I don't know what they've got planned.

935
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:40,840
I don't know if this is going to set people from, you know, from his site and do, you

936
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:43,680
know, and post on The Freak, but, you know, we'll just wait and see.

937
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:49,480
I'm hoping, you know what, DDR Freak is usually the hub of all the DDR information. Even if

938
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:53,760
it gets posted to another site, like, Aaron in Japan usually has a lot of news breaks

939
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:54,760
over there.

940
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:55,760
Oh, right. I've got to check that too.

941
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:59,640
If they break it, it's going to be posted on DDR Freak. That's the beauty of the Internet.

942
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:03,240
It's the information superhighway, and we all share the information.

943
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:06,280
You will not be left out in the cold with the information, Zaku.

944
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:11,640
And anything we find out, Zaku, I assure you we'll bring you next Sunday.

945
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:14,200
All right, that's cool. All right. Let me see.

946
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:15,600
Anything else?

947
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:19,400
Well, I got money for, you know, for buying 2DX, you know, products and basically

948
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:20,920
starting to, like,

949
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:25,320
you know, start to get into that thing. I just need a great deal on a 2DX controller

950
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:28,440
and at least, you know, one style that could be affordable.

951
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:31,920
I'm gonna spend about a hundred bucks on hold. Let me poll the chat room right now.

952
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:34,720
most affordable 2DX controller you've seen lately?

953
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:40,120
None of them. Whatever you do, don't buy the triangular looking one.

954
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:45,560
Yeah, don't buy the cheap one. You know what? You know what? Don't buy anything but the official stuff.

955
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:50,080
I know. You'll be wasting your money otherwise. You get what you pay for.

956
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:53,280
If you pay for cheap, you get cheap. And it breaks in five days.

957
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:59,480
I'm not getting the rave disc man. I know that I'm not getting the rave disc man.

958
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:02,560
I've heard there's no way I'm getting the damn read this man

959
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:05,660
by a real controller good at toys and joys what the

960
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:08,840
well I get but but you know how they still charge different price I know

961
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:13,080
what I am but you know they're 80 bucks I tell my

962
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:16,720
no he's not the cost that's cheaper than what I paid for my

963
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:20,400
things like 40 bucks I paid a hundred and twenty for mine

964
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:23,860
don't complain about eighty dollars so

965
01:26:23,860 --> 01:26:27,160
well I all I can say shop around exactly

966
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:30,160
Go to Toys and Joys, Ha-Mea, Japan Video Games.

967
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:37,160
But never order from BuyRight. Never, ever, ever, ever order from BuyRight because they will screw you.

968
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:39,160
Without lube.

969
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:41,160
It will be painful.

970
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:44,160
Shop around, Zaku. That's the best you can do.

971
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:47,160
Alright, bud. I'm gonna let you go so we can take another call. But thanks for calling in, as always.

972
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:48,160
Alright, thanks a lot, man.

973
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:49,160
Take care, Zaku.

974
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:52,160
Let's go to the next call. I see another line ringing here.

975
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:56,160
Hi! You are on Orange Lounge Radio.

976
01:26:56,160 --> 01:27:00,800
Hey, what's up? This is DJ Rama S from the East Coast. I have a box full of snow for you guys.

977
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:04,520
Oh, hooray, snow! Because we don't get that here, seriously.

978
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:07,840
I kind of figured. What's on your mind, Rama S?

979
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:10,960
Ron Ma. Ron Ma.

980
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:15,560
I don't know, if you want it to be literal, you can just call him Wild Horse S.

981
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:19,280
Because that's what Rama means. How about Rand Mask? You want me to start calling you Rand Mask?

982
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:22,280
Sure, Sky. You can call me whatever you like.

983
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:26,280
Okay George, no. What's on your mind?

984
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:30,280
Not much. I want to know how you guys are doing over there. I want some of that warm weather because I'm freezing here.

985
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:34,280
We will put some warm weather in a box and send it to you. How's that sound?

986
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:38,280
Even great. Sure, why not? Hey, that works for me boys.

987
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:42,280
That works great for me. What's going on on the East Coast scene right now?

988
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:46,280
Not much. The average is dealing with the snow.

989
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:50,280
We've got like two feet over here. People complaining about the weather, you know.

990
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:56,280
Work sucks. People complained that we closed early yesterday, but we were in the middle of a snowstorm. What do you expect us to do?

991
01:27:56,280 --> 01:28:03,280
I could not imagine anything closing due to snow, but I'm spoiled by California. What can I say?

992
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:07,280
Right? Well, no. I would love to be in California for about a good two weeks.

993
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:12,280
Now, didn't you come out here for the expo, or am I getting my...

994
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:18,280
No, no, no, no. I'm not coming out for Anime Expo, but I am coming out there for Anime Vegas sometime in September.

995
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:22,280
Whatever you do, never go to AX because it sucks.

996
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:26,280
I have no plans to go to AX.

997
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:30,280
I sent some friends of mine out there from the econ reports.

998
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:34,280
They said it sucked, so I have no plans to go.

999
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:38,280
I was cosplaying Mad Hatter, the last one I went to, walking around in these

1000
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:42,280
4 inch platform boots that were scary. It made me tall

1001
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:46,280
though. That was cool. But I was in pain for the whole

1002
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:56,460
days of the con and then someone tried to break one of my wings one more time

1003
01:28:56,460 --> 01:29:01,940
he didn't hear you I said did you snap their neck or send somebody after them I

1004
01:29:01,940 --> 01:29:05,300
still didn't hear did you snap their neck or send somebody after him to hurt

1005
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:10,980
him um I did step on somebody's foot in the four inch boots that works for me

1006
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:15,740
there you go any other thing anything else on your mind no that's it yeah

1007
01:29:15,740 --> 01:29:17,740
Not here you guys, that's all, basically.

1008
01:29:17,740 --> 01:29:19,740
Love the show.

1009
01:29:21,740 --> 01:29:24,740
I already have it pre-reserved at my store.

1010
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:25,740
Then there you have it.

1011
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:27,740
Alright, thanks for calling.

1012
01:29:27,740 --> 01:29:28,740
Cheaters.

1013
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:29,740
Have a good one, buddy.

1014
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:31,740
We're hearing from all sorts of people.

1015
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:33,740
Let's do one more call, then we'll get to the cage bench.

1016
01:29:33,740 --> 01:29:35,740
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1017
01:29:35,740 --> 01:29:36,740
Hey, Sky, it's El Mullet.

1018
01:29:36,740 --> 01:29:38,740
Hello, El Mullet.

1019
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:39,740
Hello, Sky.

1020
01:29:39,740 --> 01:29:41,740
Oh, he with my favorite nickname on the internet.

1021
01:29:41,740 --> 01:29:43,740
What's up?

1022
01:29:43,740 --> 01:29:48,740
Today's a pretty big day for me. Got to move back into school. I'm in the dorm room right now.

1023
01:29:48,740 --> 01:29:52,740
Ah, dorm life. Duh duh duh. I'm sorry, man.

1024
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:55,740
I know bad internet connections and all.

1025
01:29:55,740 --> 01:29:58,740
Quick poll in the studio. Who here has lived in a college dorm?

1026
01:29:58,740 --> 01:29:59,740
Just one.

1027
01:29:59,740 --> 01:30:01,740
Me and Jamie? That's it?

1028
01:30:01,740 --> 01:30:03,740
Wow. Oh my God. College dorm.

1029
01:30:03,740 --> 01:30:05,740
Living in the dorm was the best.

1030
01:30:05,740 --> 01:30:09,740
Living in the dorm was horrible. Horrible. I would never wish that upon anybody.

1031
01:30:09,740 --> 01:30:16,660
My dorm was so awesome because, first of all, our person who watched us never really cared

1032
01:30:16,660 --> 01:30:17,660
what we did.

1033
01:30:17,660 --> 01:30:19,080
So my friend had durables.

1034
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:21,940
They were the VCRs.

1035
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:28,460
And then I also lived within walking distance of a bar slash deli slash arcade that would

1036
01:30:28,460 --> 01:30:33,340
get imports and pirate kits all the time.

1037
01:30:33,340 --> 01:30:35,540
And they were open 24 hours.

1038
01:30:35,540 --> 01:30:36,540
Dang.

1039
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:38,340
That's pretty nice.

1040
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:42,740
The only good thing about living in the dorms for me was that I was the only one that had

1041
01:30:42,740 --> 01:30:47,260
a Super Nintendo, so all the boys would come over and play Mario Kart.

1042
01:30:47,260 --> 01:30:51,180
My roommate actually had a Playstation when it came out, and I had a TV and she didn't,

1043
01:30:51,180 --> 01:30:53,660
so we had it hooked up out of VCR.

1044
01:30:53,660 --> 01:30:55,660
I would skip my witchcraft class.

1045
01:30:55,660 --> 01:30:57,500
I took History of Witchcraft.

1046
01:30:57,500 --> 01:30:58,740
I did too in junior college.

1047
01:30:58,740 --> 01:31:03,000
To watch Sailor Moon, as this dates when I lived in the dorms.

1048
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:08,020
You know, you're guaranteed college popularity if you have something very obscure.

1049
01:31:08,020 --> 01:31:12,860
I used to, but I didn't quite get to the second half of my story. See, I was popular when

1050
01:31:12,860 --> 01:31:17,740
I had the Super Nintendo, but then when the upstairs guys got the Nintendo 64, nobody

1051
01:31:17,740 --> 01:31:24,560
loved Rob anymore. Nobody loved Rob anymore. Well, the other thing that was cool about

1052
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:30,500
me living on campus is I had a job on campus. I worked in our pool hall slash arcade. Oh,

1053
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:34,820
that's cool. And I ran our tournaments and I got, my first time playing as Saturn was

1054
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:40,220
playing Japanese games. You know what, we, our college built an arcade the year after

1055
01:31:40,220 --> 01:31:45,400
I left. Those cocks. Sucky. I know. Anyway, I'm sorry Elmo, we got sidetracked. What'd

1056
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:52,280
you call in to talk to us about tonight? I'd call in to talk about various things. Alright.

1057
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:57,340
DDR Mario, for example. I'm really looking forward to it. Yes, I want to know your thoughts

1058
01:31:57,340 --> 01:32:04,560
on DDR Mario. Well, first of all, considering it's a joint project between Konami and Nintendo,

1059
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:07,320
I mean, how can that possibly go wrong?

1060
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:12,980
I know, I'm just a giddy little fanboy thinking about the possibilities when Konami and Nintendo

1061
01:32:12,980 --> 01:32:14,760
join forces.

1062
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:16,360
This game's going to rock.

1063
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:21,360
It's going to be really nauseously cute, but it's going to rock.

1064
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:25,740
It's not going to be your traditional Dance Dance Revolution game, but it's not going

1065
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:26,840
to be crap either.

1066
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:31,560
It's going to cater to two different types of niche audiences, and when you bring them

1067
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:35,720
together, it's only going to branch them both out.

1068
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:41,680
And those two niche audiences would be kids and Nintendo fanboys? You think?

1069
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:44,400
Well, that's pretty much the same group, but...

1070
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:49,520
Well, hey, wait a minute! I'm a Nintendo fanboy!

1071
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:50,520
Still.

1072
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:54,440
Alright, any wishes, things you want to see in DDR Mario?

1073
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:59,440
I want to see a crapload of Konami original

1074
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:01,440
remixes of Nintendo songs.

1075
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:06,440
Ooh, you want to see Konami artists remixing Nintendo songs?

1076
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:10,440
That would rock, like, Soda remixing the Zelda theme or something?

1077
01:33:10,440 --> 01:33:11,440
That would be incredible.

1078
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:14,440
I need lots of Taku.

1079
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:16,440
Oh, Jamie wants Taku to come over and remix some stuff.

1080
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:20,440
Imagine Taku doing, like, the dungeon one from the first Super Mario Brothers.

1081
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:23,440
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

1082
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:25,380
Seriously, could you imagine it?

1083
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:26,520
It'd be pretty hot.

1084
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:32,180
If I had one wish, I want a dance remix of the Zelda II dungeon theme.

1085
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:32,880
Oh...

1086
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:37,500
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do...

1087
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:38,720
The remake of Super Smash-

1088
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:39,320
A-a-a-a-a-a

1089
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:40,020
...

1090
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:41,360
Jeez!

1091
01:33:41,660 --> 01:33:42,940
Whoa!

1092
01:33:42,940 --> 01:33:44,360
Hahaha!

1093
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:47,040
Oh, and then we have a comment in the chat room, Miklotov,

1094
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:50,840
Akira Yumoka better f***ing be in it remixing anything.

1095
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:51,440
Amen to that...

1096
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:56,780
Mario happy joy go lucky mix winner is you I mean seriously if he can do like

1097
01:33:56,780 --> 01:34:01,600
bit mania and all that stuff imagine him remixing like a Mario theme I just got a

1098
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:10,280
boner no no kidding no a kiri amoko remixing music from Luigi's mansion no

1099
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:16,360
we want music that people have actually heard the music in Luigi's mansion was

1100
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:19,840
kind of kind of fun spooky yeah but the game was kind of not

1101
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:24,840
Luigi's Mansion was a great kiddie-tube tech demo.

1102
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:28,840
That's pretty much it. If it came with the system, it would have been a hell of a lot better.

1103
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:31,840
But we had to pay $50 for it, so...

1104
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:34,840
Personally, I think it sucked.

1105
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:36,840
Duh-dun... get it?

1106
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:38,840
Oh, okay, because Luigi had a vacuum.

1107
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:44,840
Oh, my God, why did I call it... LOSER!

1108
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:51,840
Anyway, um, any other thoughts on your mind, El Mullet, on this lovely sunny evening?

1109
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:54,840
There are many, many thoughts. Which one would you like me to share?

1110
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:58,840
Uh, I don't know, um, the third one.

1111
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:02,840
The third one? I don't know, it's a little risque.

1112
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:06,840
So I'll just skip to the fourth one and chill out my sight again.

1113
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:08,840
What? I'm sorry, I missed that.

1114
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:11,840
I'll just skip to the fourth one and chill out my sight again.

1115
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,840
Okay. Oh, okay, go for it.

1116
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:20,560
www.insidepulse.com go to the game section and read me specifically and other people because they're awesome

1117
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:26,060
We only let him whore out that because he whores us out all the time. So we every week

1118
01:35:26,060 --> 01:35:30,480
We I know we appreciate the whoring out buddy. No problem. All right

1119
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:36,720
We're looking forward to more information on DDR Mario showing up on inside pulse as it comes out. All right. All right. Take care, bud

1120
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:39,200
Bye later

1121
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:43,520
Dark sakura has an announcement in local news in local news. I

1122
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:47,760
Put the final nail in the coffin on sack the money today. Oh

1123
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:52,160
Sack the money is dead and gone and is no more making

1124
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:58,960
Since you're not gonna say it anymore addict

1125
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:03,880
But indicate, you know, we love you. I'm not doing this for myself. I'm doing it for you guys

1126
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:07,880
I know. Because I'm still probably not going to play more than a couple...

1127
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:10,880
It's group addiction therapy for you.

1128
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:12,880
I'm still going to be too busy with school.

1129
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:14,880
I know, it's all good.

1130
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:17,880
Alright, we're going to... Is that all you wanted to say about it?

1131
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:22,880
You know what though? I gotta say though, it is kind of sad to see SACBOMANI go bye-bye because it was kind of, you know...

1132
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:23,880
Not my fault it died.

1133
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:28,880
I know, I know. It was kind of the way we all got to know each other and I think LiveJournal kind of...

1134
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:32,880
Not everyone would rather post in the crappy RVGL thread on...

1135
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:40,880
The cool thing about the Sackbomani forums was that they had like the masturbation thread and things like that, and now people use their live journals for that stuff, so...

1136
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:42,880
Still have a community.

1137
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:45,880
In fact, I'm gonna go start a masturbation thread on my live journal right now.

1138
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:49,880
I can post in my live journal right now, but it just says...

1139
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:51,880
Just kidding. No, I'm kidding! Gross!

1140
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:53,880
I'm posting in my live...

1141
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:55,880
Hey, wait a minute! I'm hot!

1142
01:36:55,880 --> 01:37:00,880
Okay, if you get befriended by me in the next couple days, you know why.

1143
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:09,880
Wait a minute, is Jamie telling Brad to click the mouse over there?

1144
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:11,880
No, but we do need to be focused on the chat room.

1145
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:16,880
Alright, anyway, let's get to the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, shall we?

1146
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:21,880
Even though I'm totally not ready to do the cage match tonight.

1147
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:27,040
I need some, I need some more time filler here while I set up for

1148
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:32,160
Cagematch. Help!

1149
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:36,240
What is going on over there in the kitchen?

1150
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:40,720
They're having an orgy in the kitchen.

1151
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:45,760
Oh boy, alright.

1152
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:50,040
Okay, I'm ready. Here we go. The Orange Lounge Radio Cagematch, boys and girls.

1153
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:58,600
The way the cage match works is that we're going to play three songs for you guys.

1154
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:03,520
You get to vote on your favorite, but you have to be in the chat room in order to vote.

1155
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:09,540
www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat, and you can make a vote, okay?

1156
01:38:09,540 --> 01:38:14,280
The winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music

1157
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:18,360
& More program, which plays 24 hours a day, seven days a week on this station when we're

1158
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:19,360
not live.

1159
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:22,060
All right, so it's your chance to pick a song.

1160
01:38:22,060 --> 01:38:25,300
Now first off, you get to hear a clip of last week's winner.

1161
01:38:25,300 --> 01:38:27,660
You only get to hear a clip because it was the winner,

1162
01:38:27,660 --> 01:38:28,500
so you already heard it

1163
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:30,720
because you listen to the show every week, right?

1164
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:31,700
All right, here it is.

1165
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:33,100
A clip of song number one.

1166
01:38:33,100 --> 01:38:34,620
And remember guys, you cannot vote

1167
01:38:34,620 --> 01:38:37,100
until all three songs have played in their entirety

1168
01:38:37,100 --> 01:38:38,760
and then we'll tell you how to vote in the chat.

1169
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:39,600
All right, here it is.

1170
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:41,080
Last week in the Orange Lounge Cage Match,

1171
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:44,820
we had a brand new winner, an old favorite, Echo Image.

1172
01:38:44,820 --> 01:38:46,360
And here it is, song number one,

1173
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:48,280
Echo Image with Endless Day.

1174
01:38:48,280 --> 01:39:14,280
Bring me back inside so we can try Cross an ocean of a mountain, say goodbye

1175
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:22,280
Reversed while I was sad I could be wrong

1176
01:39:22,280 --> 01:39:31,280
Yes, I had my reasons after all

1177
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:38,280
Can't find the evidence we're yelling back in time

1178
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:46,280
This girl is what we always thought of as fun

1179
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:52,280
Maybe she'll think that we'll find some other way

1180
01:39:52,280 --> 01:40:01,280
Maybe she'll think that we'll find some other way

1181
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:06,280
And we fall

1182
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:22,280
In love

1183
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:47,160
They used to make much sense, but I was wrong

1184
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:57,660
All right, that was a clip of song number one, Echo Image, Endless Day.

1185
01:40:57,660 --> 01:41:01,120
And now we're going to put it up against two challengers.

1186
01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:04,540
Challenger number one comes to us from Dark Sakura, and you get to hear these songs in

1187
01:41:04,540 --> 01:41:05,540
their entirety.

1188
01:41:05,540 --> 01:41:07,680
Dark Sakura, what's challenger number one tonight?

1189
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:10,880
Well, it's DJ Bobo, I believe.

1190
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:15,000
I was at Tapioca Express last night, and they put in a DVD.

1191
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,960
And the song was on it, and the video was just really awesome.

1192
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:22,760
And I instantly fell for this song, so I at least have an opportunity now to share it

1193
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:23,760
with everybody.

1194
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:24,760
Alright.

1195
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:25,760
Anything else?

1196
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:26,760
No.

1197
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:27,760
Alright.

1198
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:28,760
Does there have to always be something?

1199
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:31,240
No, but I just liked your description of the video.

1200
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:33,240
Did the video was right?

1201
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:34,240
Okay.

1202
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:39,360
The video had this one guy getting onto a subway car, and there was just people of all

1203
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:42,880
types sitting around, just minding their business, being singular.

1204
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:49,780
And then he starts handing out beer to everybody, to a nun, to this old man, to this kid.

1205
01:41:49,780 --> 01:41:53,760
And also to everyone's all, oh, we're unified and we like beer.

1206
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:54,760
Singing.

1207
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:55,760
Very cool.

1208
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:56,760
Over beer.

1209
01:41:56,760 --> 01:41:57,760
Very cool.

1210
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:01,040
I want to see the video at some point, no matter how, I haven't really heard the song,

1211
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:04,000
so no matter how good or how bad the song is, I still want to see the video.

1212
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:08,040
I need to, I'm going to actually go back and ask them what the name of the DVD is because

1213
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:09,040
I want to buy it.

1214
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:10,040
Very cool.

1215
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:14,720
Bye to Angel, Pixie Dust, No Stylin, Rice Princess, and Lanky Stylin are all leaving.

1216
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:17,720
It's emptying out in here!

1217
01:42:17,720 --> 01:42:19,640
The Orgy's going somewhere else, well thanks for coming guys.

1218
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:21,160
They're relocating to the wild.

1219
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:24,280
I think it's amazingly funny that we have the longest drive of all and we're staying

1220
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:25,280
to the end.

1221
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:27,680
Cause you're troopers, you're real fans, Sharkscroll Mel B.

1222
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:31,760
We are hardcore like the Peach Pits.

1223
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:34,360
Alright let's get to Jamie's song, here it is.

1224
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:37,280
DJ Bobo with I Believe.

1225
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:41,280
I believe. DJ Bobo, I believe. Song number two in tonight's cage match. Enjoy.

1226
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:55,780
Hold on. Small glitch there. Sorry guys. Let me start it over here. Sorry about that.

1227
01:42:55,780 --> 01:43:02,780
We've got to bring up the audio levels. Here it is, song number two, DJ Bobo, I Believe.

1228
01:43:25,780 --> 01:43:28,780
I believe in dreams

1229
01:43:28,780 --> 01:43:31,780
I believe in heroes

1230
01:43:31,780 --> 01:43:36,780
And this is not a gun

1231
01:43:36,780 --> 01:43:43,780
I believe in faith in knowledge I can learn

1232
01:43:43,780 --> 01:43:51,780
I believe all what you give you can return

1233
01:43:51,780 --> 01:43:57,780
And I'm afraid we place our life in other people's hands

1234
01:43:58,780 --> 01:44:04,780
I'll realize on earth we're all the same, we need a chance

1235
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:07,780
I believe in visions

1236
01:44:08,780 --> 01:44:10,780
I believe in love

1237
01:44:12,780 --> 01:44:14,780
I believe in magic

1238
01:44:15,780 --> 01:44:17,780
But this is not enough

1239
01:44:17,780 --> 01:44:39,620
I believe in life there's more than wrong or right

1240
01:44:39,620 --> 01:44:49,620
I believe in colors, there's no black or white

1241
01:44:49,620 --> 01:44:56,620
And you don't know what you have got until you say goodbye

1242
01:44:56,620 --> 01:45:02,620
But in my dreams one day I spread my wings and I will fly

1243
01:45:02,620 --> 01:45:27,620
I believe in visions. I believe in love. I believe in magic. This is not enough. I believe in freedom. I believe in dreams. I believe in heroes.

1244
01:45:27,620 --> 01:45:34,620
But this is not enough, this is not enough

1245
01:45:37,620 --> 01:45:45,620
I believe, I believe my dream can be reality

1246
01:45:47,620 --> 01:45:52,620
I believe my time on earth is destiny

1247
01:45:52,620 --> 01:45:55,460
Oh I believe

1248
01:45:55,460 --> 01:45:57,940
Oh I believe

1249
01:45:59,540 --> 01:46:02,540
That we are strong and us

1250
01:46:02,540 --> 01:46:04,060
Oh I..

1251
01:46:04,060 --> 01:46:06,460
I believe

1252
01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:08,900
We are strong

1253
01:46:08,900 --> 01:46:11,320
and me as a nation

1254
01:46:11,320 --> 01:46:13,620
I believe

1255
01:46:13,620 --> 01:46:16,220
That we are strong

1256
01:46:16,220 --> 01:46:18,500
I believe

1257
01:46:18,500 --> 01:46:19,700
I believe

1258
01:46:19,700 --> 01:46:21,320
This life is.

1259
01:46:21,320 --> 01:46:33,320
We are strong and I believe in freedom We are strong and I believe in heroes

1260
01:46:33,320 --> 01:46:48,660
All righty guys, that was song number two. That was DJ Bobo with I Believe. Do we believe

1261
01:46:48,660 --> 01:46:51,060
in this song? Let's find out. Jamie.

1262
01:46:51,060 --> 01:46:56,100
I was just transfixed by this video. So, I'm sitting there eating my tater tots and curry

1263
01:46:56,100 --> 01:47:01,100
at Tab X and I'm like, ooh, so I give it a ten.

1264
01:47:01,100 --> 01:47:03,100
Alright, who's got the mic? Sharks Girl!

1265
01:47:04,100 --> 01:47:07,100
I grabbed the mic to send it to other people, okay!

1266
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:11,100
Actually I liked it, it was pretty messy. I kinda want to see the video actually.

1267
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:18,100
It was happy, yay, I have to give it a number, huh? 8.395

1268
01:47:19,100 --> 01:47:20,100
8.395 from Sharks Girl.

1269
01:47:21,100 --> 01:47:22,100
Explicit.

1270
01:47:23,100 --> 01:47:28,100
I actually dig the music. It's still pretty smooth. I would say 8.5.

1271
01:47:28,100 --> 01:47:37,100
Kind of throws me back to the late 90s type stuff, techno type stuff.

1272
01:47:37,100 --> 01:47:41,100
Kind of sounds like No Mercy except a lot less falsified.

1273
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:45,300
Um, I'll give it a 7.92.

1274
01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:51,300
Alright, um, for me personally, I definitely grew up singing the mid-90s thing as well,

1275
01:47:51,300 --> 01:47:57,940
like an inspirational, I can do anything type, like, yeah, I believe I can fly, like dance,

1276
01:47:57,940 --> 01:48:02,380
I don't know, it's like an inspirational, which is why I'm thinking about Jamie describing

1277
01:48:02,380 --> 01:48:06,980
the video a little bit before and I'm like, that totally goes against that song.

1278
01:48:06,980 --> 01:48:12,960
no it was about it was like a unity I believe everybody getting together over

1279
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:13,360
beer

1280
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:15,880
all right well I'm not supposed to we're not supposed to take the videos into

1281
01:48:15,880 --> 01:48:16,440
account

1282
01:48:16,440 --> 01:48:20,980
during this case also the song strictly so it was I like the throwback aspect of

1283
01:48:20,980 --> 01:48:21,940
it and it left me

1284
01:48:21,940 --> 01:48:26,620
it left me feeling hopeful and inspirational and making me wanna pray

1285
01:48:26,620 --> 01:48:30,620
so I give it a 6.66 no I gotta get something higher than that

1286
01:48:30,620 --> 01:48:35,540
an 8.666 I believe I was bored

1287
01:48:35,540 --> 01:48:43,060
so I get to seven. You know he's got to have his lame pun or it's just not a show. Alright,

1288
01:48:43,060 --> 01:48:50,860
here we go. Song number three from Loki. I was going to put in the girls remix. I was

1289
01:48:50,860 --> 01:48:56,020
told in the chat room to do it, I was told by Jamie to do it, but my judgment, you know,

1290
01:48:56,020 --> 01:49:01,180
said no, that would be wrong. So I'll do it next week if this doesn't win. This is, um,

1291
01:49:01,180 --> 01:49:05,360
I don't know for how many of you out there have seen the Sin City trailer.

1292
01:49:05,360 --> 01:49:08,680
This is a song playing in the background except that's the instrumental version.

1293
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:13,560
This is The Cells by a group called The Servant.

1294
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:16,600
Alright, song number three, The Cells by The Servant.

1295
01:49:16,600 --> 01:49:23,600
Sounds goth-y. We'll see. Enjoy!

1296
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:53,600
My skin feels like orange peel My eyes are peed, my vacuum sealed

1297
01:49:53,600 --> 01:50:01,600
My organs move like a swarm of eels We should be more adventurous the way they

1298
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:07,600
feel They annoy me, they'll still employ me

1299
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:10,600
They could destroy me, they should destroy me

1300
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:13,600
We ain't Chinese, I'm funny

1301
01:50:13,600 --> 01:50:18,600
Look for each other in the TV screen

1302
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:22,600
I'm your self and it's time to stand

1303
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:25,600
I'm your self and it's time to stand

1304
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:31,600
All I do, I wanna do is you

1305
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:35,600
Every day and that's my day

1306
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:38,600
That's my day and that's my little risk

1307
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:44,600
All I do, all I wanna do

1308
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:53,600
Sissy skin, they move on mass

1309
01:50:53,600 --> 01:50:56,600
Like a rash on the back of a manky cat

1310
01:50:56,600 --> 01:50:59,600
Now in I go, like a fool

1311
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:04,600
I can't resist dipping in the pool

1312
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:07,600
Watch them, watch me, watch them too

1313
01:51:07,600 --> 01:51:11,600
Across the street, across the realm

1314
01:51:11,600 --> 01:51:14,600
I dress myself like a charcoal sketch

1315
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:18,600
My eyes are brown and my head's red

1316
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:22,600
They annoy me, they'll soon employ me

1317
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:25,600
They could destroy me, they should enjoy me

1318
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:28,600
We ain't Chinese, up on me

1319
01:51:28,600 --> 01:51:34,600
To live for each other and to see me scream

1320
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:41,600
The sun goes up and the sun goes down

1321
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:44,600
The day has come and soon will come

1322
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:49,600
For us to all understand

1323
01:51:50,600 --> 01:51:53,600
Every day and every night day

1324
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:55,600
Every day and every night day

1325
01:51:55,600 --> 01:52:04,080
Come right here, all I do, I wanna see you

1326
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:07,280
I don't trust that it's time to tell

1327
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:10,640
I drag myself into the town

1328
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:16,320
All I do, I wanna see you

1329
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:35,320
The sales I am at the moment will soon die But I will be here, oh I'll still be here

1330
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:41,320
The sales I am at the moment will soon die

1331
01:52:41,320 --> 01:52:43,320
But I will be here

1332
01:52:44,460 --> 01:52:48,460
Oh, I'll still be here

1333
01:52:50,940 --> 01:52:53,940
Oh, you're the one who's out there

1334
01:52:53,940 --> 01:52:55,940
The sun will tell

1335
01:52:55,940 --> 01:52:58,940
Let myself into the shadows

1336
01:52:58,940 --> 01:53:04,940
All I do, I wanna be here

1337
01:54:04,940 --> 01:54:17,260
Alright, that was song number three, The Servant with the Cells.

1338
01:54:17,260 --> 01:54:20,820
Let's see if that was Good Cells or Bad Cells.

1339
01:54:20,820 --> 01:54:21,820
Jamie.

1340
01:54:21,820 --> 01:54:22,820
Mitochondria.

1341
01:54:22,820 --> 01:54:23,820
It's like Parasites.

1342
01:54:23,820 --> 01:54:24,820
I don't know.

1343
01:54:24,820 --> 01:54:33,820
I don't know if I liked it or not.

1344
01:54:33,820 --> 01:54:40,820
I would listen to it if I were doing something else, but I wouldn't just listen to it and it definitely wouldn't go in my car.

1345
01:54:40,820 --> 01:54:42,820
So it gets 5.

1346
01:54:49,820 --> 01:54:53,820
It made me very mellow and I kind of liked it. I think I'd like to listen to it a little bit.

1347
01:54:53,820 --> 01:54:55,820
Um...

1348
01:54:55,820 --> 01:54:59,320
I want to say a 7.12398.

1349
01:55:03,820 --> 01:55:06,320
I don't know, I just didn't feel the music too much.

1350
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:10,320
I mean, it's a good song, but I just didn't feel it in a way.

1351
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:11,820
I'd say 6.8.

1352
01:55:15,320 --> 01:55:17,320
It's quite a pretty good ambiance, actually.

1353
01:55:17,320 --> 01:55:20,820
I mean, it's not something I would bump in my system or nothing like that,

1354
01:55:20,820 --> 01:55:24,820
but it kind of has a very, kind of a dark theme to it, obviously.

1355
01:55:24,820 --> 01:55:31,820
It kind of throws me to the Silent Hill 4 type music. I was thinking it actually. I'd give it a...

1356
01:55:31,820 --> 01:55:40,820
Although when you talk about wild products expecting something wild, I'll give it an 8.12.

1357
01:56:01,820 --> 01:56:09,100
I give it like a six and a half you have to see this with the trailer it is goddamn

1358
01:56:09,100 --> 01:56:13,980
sexy that's all I have to say cuz now the instrumental version is gonna be in

1359
01:56:13,980 --> 01:56:18,020
the movie I think actually guys boys can't takes away from the song cuz you

1360
01:56:18,020 --> 01:56:23,820
missed all the cool guitar riffs but I was looking hard for that instrumental

1361
01:56:23,820 --> 01:56:28,420
version but I couldn't find it because the soundtracks not yet so but goddamn

1362
01:56:28,420 --> 01:56:34,800
at Go See Sin City. It's gonna be fucking awesome coming out April 1st. April 1st, See

1363
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:39,840
Sin City, the only movie you'll need to see the entire year. Screw Star Wars and King

1364
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:46,840
Kong. This is the best movie ever. And I give it a 10. Alright, it's not up to us to decide,

1365
01:56:47,720 --> 01:56:51,320
it's up to you to decide. You're gonna place your vote for one of these three songs. Song

1366
01:56:51,320 --> 01:56:53,640
number one, Echo Image, Endless Day.

1367
01:56:53,640 --> 01:57:00,640
I

1368
01:57:03,320 --> 01:57:07,280
song number two is DJ Bobo with a song called

1369
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:14,280
I believe

1370
01:57:14,280 --> 01:57:26,580
And song number three, The Servant, with a song called The Cells.

1371
01:57:26,580 --> 01:57:40,220
Please vote now, send a private message to Skye in the chat room with your vote, and

1372
01:57:40,220 --> 01:57:43,940
if you don't understand what I'm saying there, I'll type it in chat for you guys right now.

1373
01:57:43,940 --> 01:57:47,440
uh... or is already dot com click on chat in the meantime

1374
01:57:47,440 --> 01:57:48,500
low-key

1375
01:57:48,500 --> 01:57:50,640
how about that sim scene

1376
01:57:50,640 --> 01:57:54,220
how about it's not going around for much longer that's for sure

1377
01:57:54,220 --> 01:57:57,260
uh... so the big news this week was

1378
01:57:57,260 --> 01:57:59,500
ddr uk was shut down

1379
01:57:59,500 --> 01:58:05,080
why was shut down voluntarily and here is why voluntarily because

1380
01:58:05,080 --> 01:58:06,660
the uh...

1381
01:58:06,660 --> 01:58:12,140
uk equivalent of the r-i-a-a came after them and says

1382
01:58:12,140 --> 01:58:16,100
Currently, the site has been placed into a temporary state of closure. This is a direct

1383
01:58:16,100 --> 01:58:22,000
response to communication from the IFPI in regards to a variety of links and files that

1384
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:27,120
were available from the site. No direct legal action is being raised and this action has

1385
01:58:27,120 --> 01:58:32,540
been voluntarily undertaken. We hope for normal service to resume soon. Now, there's a little

1386
01:58:32,540 --> 01:58:41,080
bit more to go along with that. And apparently, this was posted in, it was posted on my cell,

1387
01:58:41,080 --> 01:58:48,080
but it was actually posted from the Game Facts boards. Let's see if I can find this real quick here.

1388
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:57,080
It's basically a run down, kind of a quick little fact of what's going on in regards to why the site was closed and yada yada.

1389
01:58:57,080 --> 01:59:08,080
I do know, well, the site was taken down voluntarily. They haven't pressed charges. It's due to the response for the official files that were on there.

1390
01:59:08,080 --> 01:59:13,680
on there. So, you know, obviously they got in trouble for that. Where's the link here?

1391
01:59:13,680 --> 01:59:24,200
Let's see. Now there were some other interesting things on that, like, I wish I could really

1392
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:36,000
find this. Where is it? Anyways, it's basically, they got the logs of everyone that downloaded

1393
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:40,920
that crap so they don't know what exactly that's gonna entail as far as

1394
01:59:40,920 --> 01:59:45,760
you know all the people have downloaded this stuff you know whether they're

1395
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:49,240
gonna get in trouble or whatnot lucky for me I don't download off that site at

1396
01:59:49,240 --> 01:59:53,840
least none of the official stuff and not from there now the other thing though

1397
01:59:53,840 --> 02:00:00,280
which was interesting and this is in regards to but my cell they're talking

1398
02:00:00,280 --> 02:00:08,920
about taking down their sim file thing, too. Here we go. No, that's not it. And basically,

1399
02:00:08,920 --> 02:00:14,520
no, the same reasons. Oh, okay, here we go. The DDRUK legal proceedings fact. It says,

1400
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:19,360
what happened to the site? DDRUK was recently contacted by the IFPI regarding legally held

1401
02:00:19,360 --> 02:00:23,400
music recordings being distributed on the site. The recordings in question were the

1402
02:00:23,400 --> 02:00:28,160
official sim files from Konami's Dance Dance Revolution game. How'd they find out? Officially,

1403
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:35,160
Unfortunately, we do not know. Unfortunately, unofficially, the AFPI website allows anonymous reporting of copyright infringement.

1404
02:00:35,160 --> 02:00:45,160
Since the downloads are only accessible by registered members, it is likely a DDRUK site member contacted the IFPI and gave them details of the files being stored.

1405
02:00:45,160 --> 02:00:49,160
Uh oh, they must have banned somebody and they didn't like that.

1406
02:00:49,160 --> 02:01:02,160
Anyways, what's going to happen to the site? Right now we do not know. Miss is currently unreachable and is currently in discussions. The site is down for the moment and is likely to remain that way until later dates.

1407
02:01:02,160 --> 02:01:09,160
Currently unconfirmed. Is Miss facing a fine or jail time? This is the guy that runs the site.

1408
02:01:09,160 --> 02:01:13,580
No, Ms. has given full cooperation with the authorities.

1409
02:01:13,580 --> 02:01:20,640
They have requested that, requested the BitTorrent tracker statistics from his site logs.

1410
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:26,560
Whilst recent database errors have erased most recent data, it is understood that a

1411
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:31,400
log of all uploading and downloading has been done through the site, including user names,

1412
02:01:31,400 --> 02:01:32,640
profiles, and IP addresses.

1413
02:01:32,640 --> 02:01:38,920
In return, he has, he is avoiding any punitive action and says, what will happen to the users?

1414
02:01:38,920 --> 02:01:44,120
this we do not know, aside from the fact that Ms. has complied with the request, we do not

1415
02:01:44,120 --> 02:01:51,120
know what action, if any, the AFPI intends to take and this will be updated as, you know,

1416
02:01:51,120 --> 02:01:53,640
they know more.

1417
02:01:53,640 --> 02:01:59,600
Comment from the chat room, coming from same, says that fact is fake and I'm sorry but I

1418
02:01:59,600 --> 02:02:03,220
tend to agree because I wouldn't believe that goddamn thing I would read on the game facts

1419
02:02:03,220 --> 02:02:04,220
message boards.

1420
02:02:04,220 --> 02:02:19,220
Well, whatever. Okay, all we know... I... Well, here's the thing that also was suspicious of me, is the BitTorrent files, they aren't on that server. They're on ddramerica.com, which also got shut down, but that's another thing entirely.

1421
02:02:19,220 --> 02:02:24,220
I think this is just a scare tactic, honestly. I don't... I mean, come on, people!

1422
02:02:24,220 --> 02:02:33,220
It's frickin' DDR sim files. They're not even often the full songs. They're little cut-down versions of these full songs.

1423
02:02:33,220 --> 02:02:43,220
If they were really gonna do lawsuits against the users of DDR UK, don't you think everybody that's ever used Supernova would be extremely fucked right about now?

1424
02:02:43,220 --> 02:02:50,220
I mean, seriously, you can download, you could have downloaded way more stuff, full CDs off Supernova, Dark Sakura.

1425
02:02:50,220 --> 02:02:55,220
Some of us still download full CDs off of Bytor.com.

1426
02:02:55,220 --> 02:02:59,220
Yeah, they really shut down Supernova there, it's like a completely, anyway.

1427
02:02:59,220 --> 02:03:00,220
Besides the Supernova here.

1428
02:03:00,220 --> 02:03:06,220
So basically, yeah, the whole scare thing's going on right now, everyone's, you know, in pandemonium or whatever.

1429
02:03:06,220 --> 02:03:11,220
Now the other thing that happened this week is there's yet another character created, and this character...

1430
02:03:11,220 --> 02:03:21,220
But even if they're trying to catch us or anything like that, we can always file back a counter lawsuit for invading our privacy and stuff.

1431
02:03:21,220 --> 02:03:24,220
That's why...

1432
02:03:24,220 --> 02:03:27,220
I think you're more just getting into international messiness.

1433
02:03:27,220 --> 02:03:32,220
I think it's just international messiness. I think somebody's pulling your leg over on GameFAQs, I honestly do.

1434
02:03:32,220 --> 02:03:37,220
Like it's RIAA crap, they lost the lawsuit with the MP3s and shit, so...

1435
02:03:37,220 --> 02:03:46,220
I mean, because when you get into the international stuff, because Canada frickin' was upheld in court that the people sharing files were protected in Canada.

1436
02:03:46,220 --> 02:03:52,220
So, if you're a Canadian user that downloaded off of DDRUK, you'll get off scot free, but if you're an American user, hey, you're going to be screwed.

1437
02:03:52,220 --> 02:03:54,220
I don't know. Anyway.

1438
02:03:54,220 --> 02:03:58,220
Because it's the IPI, it's not the RIA.

1439
02:03:58,220 --> 02:04:15,220
As I was mentioning, dancing character, I have to show Rob, obviously this is not good radio because you can't see it, but this is something you would think I would have made. But I didn't make it, so anyways.

1440
02:04:15,220 --> 02:04:23,920
Okay, a description for those at home. Basically, somebody has created a DDR character for StepMania

1441
02:04:23,920 --> 02:04:30,880
that is a naked girl, well, a topless girl, and her boobs in full glory and wearing tight

1442
02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:35,480
little panty bottoms or something she's got there, little skirt bottom. What is the name

1443
02:04:35,480 --> 02:04:39,240
of this character and where can the little boys who want to masturbate to it? Oh, I love

1444
02:04:39,240 --> 02:04:44,360
that! Did you see on the upskirt cam? You can see her little punani on the little upskirt

1445
02:04:44,360 --> 02:04:49,760
did you see that? It was a little dark spot in the shape of a triangle. Okay, where can

1446
02:04:49,760 --> 02:05:03,120
the boys get this? Well, it's been taken down due to, I guess, bandwidth issues. But, it

1447
02:05:03,120 --> 02:05:10,320
can be found, there was a thread on DDR Freak in the sim file section that you could find

1448
02:05:10,320 --> 02:05:19,880
this. I luckily searched Google and in a cache page I found the link here, which I will later

1449
02:05:19,880 --> 02:05:27,420
post to, I'll post the link in OrangeLaunchRadio.com where you can find it, which I'll upload to

1450
02:05:27,420 --> 02:05:33,440
my site or something. That was the first thing I noticed is that you could see her cootie

1451
02:05:33,440 --> 02:05:39,200
box when it was going up the skirt there. I can't believe you guys missed it. Jamie's

1452
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:48,200
kind of, now Jamie's even got that curious look on her face. Oh. Anyway.

1453
02:05:48,200 --> 02:05:55,320
That's ridiculous. Where is my pantsless rage? Seriously, where's our pantsless rage, our

1454
02:05:55,320 --> 02:06:03,960
boydancers pervs so yeah enough of that I I don't remember where I got it but is

1455
02:06:03,960 --> 02:06:10,680
some guy made it and I'm sure if you look over in if you search for like

1456
02:06:10,680 --> 02:06:15,840
black and oh is it step mania character or or it's like I'll remember it's just

1457
02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:21,480
whatever they posted in the one thread I found it pretty easy but I will post it

1458
02:06:21,480 --> 02:06:28,480
a link, um, it will be in our forums to where you can find the wonderful StepMania, um,

1459
02:06:28,480 --> 02:06:36,920
character. Yeah. Anyways. Um, so that's pretty much all that's going on right now. Just a

1460
02:06:36,920 --> 02:06:43,680
whole bunch of scaring, you know, scared people and that kind of thing. But, I should mention,

1461
02:06:43,680 --> 02:06:48,960
because we haven't mentioned it yet, um, big news will be coming this week regarding Dancing

1462
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:54,080
Stage Fusion, the 25th through the 27th. We're going to be finding out all about that. So,

1463
02:06:54,080 --> 02:07:02,680
couple things. Exciting. I don't know what else to say. You're still giggling over there,

1464
02:07:02,680 --> 02:07:06,760
explicit. You're like a little 12-year-old boy who just saw boobies on the TV for the

1465
02:07:06,760 --> 02:07:16,740
first time on HBO. Dude, change of channel 9, it's the breast exam girl. Actually, this

1466
02:07:16,740 --> 02:07:23,620
This brings up a good topic. I would like to go around the room. You don't have to participate

1467
02:07:23,620 --> 02:07:28,060
if you don't want to. But I want to talk about the first time you ever saw the naughty bits

1468
02:07:28,060 --> 02:07:42,420
of the opposite gender. Dark Sakura.

1469
02:07:42,420 --> 02:07:46,620
is kind of embarrassing mm-hmm but there was this little there was a kid I played

1470
02:07:46,620 --> 02:07:50,140
with in my neighborhood and I was nine and he thought that one day it would be

1471
02:07:50,140 --> 02:08:01,300
funny to pull down his pants and I told his mommy and got him spanked that's hot

1472
02:08:01,300 --> 02:08:06,580
it was our next-door neighbor this is when I used to run around carrying my

1473
02:08:06,580 --> 02:08:16,660
gizmo everywhere my little gremlins doll gizmo huh but seriously that was my

1474
02:08:16,660 --> 02:08:22,220
first exposure and I thought it was incredibly stupid

1475
02:08:22,660 --> 02:08:34,700
all right my mommy my mom had no idea how to explain to me anyway anyway Mel B

1476
02:08:34,700 --> 02:08:38,700
You guys don't have to participate, I'm just talking to whoever's got the mic.

1477
02:08:38,700 --> 02:08:41,700
First time seeing live naughty bits, man.

1478
02:08:41,700 --> 02:08:46,700
I mean, okay, like all media aside, gosh.

1479
02:08:46,700 --> 02:08:54,700
I don't know, I think by the time I had seen live ones, I had been so desensitized by all the porn that my dad hid underneath his bed in the cab.

1480
02:08:54,700 --> 02:09:01,700
It really wasn't anything new to me other than like, okay, it's about time I saw this live, you know, it's 3D and...

1481
02:09:01,700 --> 02:09:03,700
3D?

1482
02:09:03,700 --> 02:09:07,940
yeah I mean it was like they didn't have any of that rad 70s porn with the glasses

1483
02:09:10,020 --> 02:09:13,780
and there weren't any cool like you know rainbows in the background or like you know little stars

1484
02:09:13,780 --> 02:09:19,700
flying around I mean but I guess it was a treat to see like you know nice little shadows and like

1485
02:09:19,700 --> 02:09:26,100
things just wow there's texture to them and oh they're cold or wow it's it was

1486
02:09:27,060 --> 02:09:31,300
yeah yeah the first time I've ever seen them was in my it was in my truck and it was in the back

1487
02:09:31,300 --> 02:09:38,300
of the cab, and it was a very cold night. We had to keep each other warm somehow.

1488
02:09:38,740 --> 02:09:41,620
Anybody else care to go, explicit?

1489
02:09:41,620 --> 02:09:45,660
If coming out of your mom's vagina is a cow.

1490
02:09:45,660 --> 02:09:48,900
Not quite there, buddy.

1491
02:09:48,900 --> 02:09:55,900
Alright, okay, I was one years old. Okay, actually I don't even remember what the hell

1492
02:09:56,260 --> 02:10:01,260
happened when I was one. Okay, let's go the year when I was three years old.

1493
02:10:01,260 --> 02:10:09,900
Okay, I come to the bathroom, someone rushes to the shower, naked, I was like, holy shit,

1494
02:10:09,900 --> 02:10:14,180
what is this?

1495
02:10:14,180 --> 02:10:19,940
And what, and what, and what is head growth your, and what is head growth down there?

1496
02:10:19,940 --> 02:10:22,580
Wow, this is getting interesting.

1497
02:10:22,580 --> 02:10:24,860
Did I really want to bring up this topic?

1498
02:10:24,860 --> 02:10:25,860
I don't know.

1499
02:10:25,860 --> 02:10:27,700
Hey, you're the one who brought it.

1500
02:10:27,700 --> 02:10:35,100
You know what? I dated girls in high school and that's how I saw boobs. Like Mel, you'd

1501
02:10:35,100 --> 02:10:39,260
seen it on TV enough times, it was just like, oh, now I've got them live and in person.

1502
02:10:39,260 --> 02:10:46,700
But really, you know, sad enough. But now, remember ladies, I'm gay. But the first time

1503
02:10:46,700 --> 02:10:54,940
I saw the lower equator was actually at a strip bar. My girlfriends were always virginal

1504
02:10:54,940 --> 02:10:59,940
and peer and, you know, didn't want to show that, you know, so.

1505
02:10:59,940 --> 02:11:02,940
I see.

1506
02:11:02,940 --> 02:11:07,940
Well, boobs are one thing though. I mean, hell, if you're in Europe, hey, boobs are just nothing else, you know.

1507
02:11:07,940 --> 02:11:12,940
Anybody else want to go? Low key.

1508
02:11:12,940 --> 02:11:17,940
This is easy. I assume this is the first time in live.

1509
02:11:17,940 --> 02:11:22,940
It was sixth grade. They were doing presentations in my class

1510
02:11:22,940 --> 02:11:31,640
for, um, before, um, we were studying Roman history or something like that. No, it wasn't

1511
02:11:31,640 --> 02:11:39,720
Roman history, we were reading, um, no, we were reading, um, I want to say it was like,

1512
02:11:39,720 --> 02:11:45,140
not Julius Caesar, no, um, something to do with Greek and Romans, we were studying history

1513
02:11:45,140 --> 02:11:50,520
or something, and there was a presentation being done in the class, and, you know, people

1514
02:11:50,520 --> 02:12:14,520
All in front of the class.

1515
02:12:14,520 --> 02:12:28,120
Oh yeah, we're supposed to talk about games on this show. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. Games

1516
02:12:28,120 --> 02:12:35,000
that little kids play. Alright, let's go to a break guys. When we come back from the break

1517
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,760
we're going to do the FUs of the week, we're going to talk about who won the cage match

1518
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:42,660
and who knows, whatever else we feel like. We're going to do whatever the hell we please,

1519
02:12:42,660 --> 02:12:46,900
basically here on Orange Lounge Radio. So you just be ready for it.

1520
02:12:46,900 --> 02:12:49,340
We'll be back after this.

1521
02:12:49,340 --> 02:12:53,900
I decided we'd do a break of some DDR songs, some pretty well-known DDR songs.

1522
02:12:53,900 --> 02:12:58,140
And just for Jamie, I made the first song by Taku.

1523
02:12:58,140 --> 02:13:01,780
And it's one we haven't played in a while. So starting off, we have Era

1524
02:13:01,780 --> 02:13:02,960
Starting off the mix.

1525
02:13:02,960 --> 02:13:09,960
we'll be back

1526
02:18:02,960 --> 02:18:24,840
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

1527
02:18:24,840 --> 02:18:29,140
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

1528
02:18:29,140 --> 02:18:34,140
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

1529
02:18:34,140 --> 02:18:37,840
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio. Thank you guys for sticking with us.

1530
02:18:37,840 --> 02:18:41,440
We're getting into the last hour of the show here. We have plenty of stuff coming up,

1531
02:18:41,440 --> 02:18:44,240
including some favorite segments you've come to know and love.

1532
02:18:44,240 --> 02:18:48,040
We gotta get one of those segments taken care of, though, and that would be the cage match.

1533
02:18:48,040 --> 02:18:49,740
You guys wanna know who won tonight's cage match?

1534
02:18:49,740 --> 02:18:51,040
Uh-huh.

1535
02:18:51,040 --> 02:18:54,560
I have to give props to the chat room. Lot of people voting

1536
02:18:54,560 --> 02:18:58,120
tonight's cage match. Very pleased to see a lot of participation from the chat room tonight

1537
02:18:58,120 --> 02:19:01,600
and you know what? Once again, one vote

1538
02:19:01,600 --> 02:19:04,680
separating not only the winner from the second place song

1539
02:19:04,680 --> 02:19:07,720
but from the third place song as well. It was that

1540
02:19:07,720 --> 02:19:12,760
freaking close tonight. So here it is. The winning song of tonight's cage match

1541
02:19:12,760 --> 02:19:18,160
is...

1542
02:19:18,160 --> 02:19:27,760
Echo Image with Endless Day, one more time, very, very close, one vote, any other direction

1543
02:19:27,760 --> 02:19:32,980
would have made all the difference, so very nice, thank you for participating you guys,

1544
02:19:32,980 --> 02:19:40,440
and we'll do it again next week. Alright, moving on, you know, we're kind of, you know,

1545
02:19:40,440 --> 02:19:44,680
getting into the last hour of the show, we really only have what, FUs, Ask Orange, Lounge,

1546
02:19:44,680 --> 02:19:49,460
left to go, right? You know the usual bits. Well, we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we get

1547
02:19:49,460 --> 02:19:53,040
bored and we're looking for things to talk about on the show because, you know, if we

1548
02:19:53,040 --> 02:19:57,920
don't talk about DDR, there'll be people out there that go, man, that Orange Lounge

1549
02:19:57,920 --> 02:20:06,920
Radio sucks. They don't ever talk about DDR. They talk about the first time they saw boobs

1550
02:20:06,920 --> 02:20:11,720
or penises. They're all gay. What's wrong with them?

1551
02:20:11,720 --> 02:20:15,720
You know chat room, you're really missing something without being able to see Rob's face while he does this.

1552
02:20:15,720 --> 02:20:20,720
Well, I can talk about both at once. Man, everybody at Orange Lounge Radio is gay.

1553
02:20:20,720 --> 02:20:25,720
It's a big gay station. Everything about it is gay.

1554
02:20:25,720 --> 02:20:29,720
You mean unhappy?

1555
02:20:29,720 --> 02:20:34,720
So, in an effort... Where is that rainbow cake, man? What kind of hug is this?

1556
02:20:34,720 --> 02:20:39,720
Oh, how fruity. In an effort to, you know, warm ourselves up more to the DDR community,

1557
02:20:39,720 --> 02:20:45,840
we seek inspiration from posts from ddrfreak

1558
02:20:45,840 --> 02:20:48,960
oh god no

1559
02:20:48,960 --> 02:20:50,520
that's right

1560
02:20:50,520 --> 02:20:57,520
it's time for the ddr chit chat post of the week

1561
02:20:58,320 --> 02:21:01,880
since you know we are syndicated now on ddrfreak radio you know we gotta give a

1562
02:21:01,880 --> 02:21:03,700
shout out to our

1563
02:21:03,700 --> 02:21:06,600
our fellow friends over at ddrfreak so

1564
02:21:06,600 --> 02:21:08,200
we're working together

1565
02:21:08,200 --> 02:21:14,600
with the Freak by stealing one of their topics for one of our own. So here it is, the DDR

1566
02:21:14,600 --> 02:21:20,000
topic of the week. Here it is guys, and we, y'all are going to have to answer this, okay,

1567
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:29,560
here it is. Subject of message, what are tournaments like? And that's the entire message right

1568
02:21:29,560 --> 02:21:34,280
there. It says C title in the message. So, Jamie, what are tournaments like? Hell on

1569
02:21:34,280 --> 02:21:41,200
earth oh come on the thing is how the past ones I've been to I've had a hand

1570
02:21:41,200 --> 02:21:48,080
in running hell on earth and you don't eat all day now we're talking about DDR

1571
02:21:48,080 --> 02:21:52,280
tournaments I didn't talk about DDR turn now well now wait a minute though there

1572
02:21:52,280 --> 02:21:55,480
was the one tournament we had in Sacramento where a lanky style and rice

1573
02:21:55,480 --> 02:22:00,520
princess were running the kitchen with deep-fried Twinkies I had half of one so

1574
02:22:00,520 --> 02:22:02,520
So you did get to eat that day.

1575
02:22:02,520 --> 02:22:04,520
That's all I needed to eat all day.

1576
02:22:06,520 --> 02:22:09,520
Explicit, what are DDR tournaments like?

1577
02:22:09,520 --> 02:22:11,520
Heaven or hell.

1578
02:22:11,520 --> 02:22:22,520
The good thing about tournaments is, of course, you get to meet with a lot of people, chit-chat, and compete so you can feel welcome to see how your skills match up with others.

1579
02:22:22,520 --> 02:22:25,520
Are you better than everybody else or not?

1580
02:22:25,520 --> 02:22:31,520
Some tournaments actually serve food, but I'm currently in a tournament I'm organizing called Sacktown Smackdown

1581
02:22:31,520 --> 02:22:33,520
Not piss!

1582
02:22:33,520 --> 02:22:35,520
We don't need to go back there

1583
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:37,520
I'll talk to you about that

1584
02:22:37,520 --> 02:22:41,520
Talk to Mel about it another time, I'm not bringing that subject back up this week

1585
02:22:41,520 --> 02:22:43,520
Okay, okay, back on topic

1586
02:22:43,520 --> 02:22:47,520
And the tournament is just to meet the organizers

1587
02:22:47,520 --> 02:22:53,520
And for those who are lonely they can visit the opposite sex if that's possible

1588
02:22:53,520 --> 02:22:57,520
Okay, as for the hell part, this is where I get cranky.

1589
02:22:57,520 --> 02:23:00,520
People bitch about the fucking pads.

1590
02:23:00,520 --> 02:23:03,520
Oh, wow, the up-air doesn't work.

1591
02:23:03,520 --> 02:23:06,520
Well, that's too bad. If it doesn't...

1592
02:23:06,520 --> 02:23:09,520
We only say that if it doesn't work immediately.

1593
02:23:09,520 --> 02:23:13,520
You gotta have a step up. No matter how many pounds of pressure put on it.

1594
02:23:13,520 --> 02:23:17,520
But I've seen people complain because they tap it very lightly and you get a miss.

1595
02:23:17,520 --> 02:23:21,520
Oh, wow, you got a miss. So what? Focus more. Don't give up.

1596
02:23:21,520 --> 02:23:25,840
saying what oh my god you screwed me over on the fucking tournament or

1597
02:23:25,840 --> 02:23:29,880
complaining about the rules and of course you get the butt-raping drama

1598
02:23:29,880 --> 02:23:36,240
that's been going around and shit Oh NorCal versus SoCal oh wow what's that

1599
02:23:36,240 --> 02:23:41,560
what that what what big of a deal is it? Seattle versus everybody! NorCal versus SoCal ain't no rivalry man

1600
02:23:41,560 --> 02:23:45,400
especially Freestyle that's a one-sided ass whooping that ain't a rivalry oh

1601
02:23:45,400 --> 02:23:49,520
dear oh dear he's starting something okay that's what I'm getting to in the

1602
02:23:49,520 --> 02:23:54,520
freestyle section. You know, freestyle is always about opinions. You can't complain

1603
02:23:54,520 --> 02:23:59,440
saying you deserve first place or second place. Unless you got something that's a tournament

1604
02:23:59,440 --> 02:24:04,680
that's favoring one side or the other. If that is the case, they shouldn't even be judges.

1605
02:24:04,680 --> 02:24:09,600
Of course Mel B knows what kind of tournaments those have been.

1606
02:24:09,600 --> 02:24:12,440
Alright Mel B, I gotta ask Mel B though. Oh I'm sorry.

1607
02:24:12,440 --> 02:24:15,720
I'll continue the address to Mel B. Okay, Mel B, because you've won a couple

1608
02:24:15,720 --> 02:24:19,080
tournaments and you've had a hand in judging and putting together some what

1609
02:24:19,080 --> 02:24:29,600
are tournaments like? Payday. It's Mel Ego B everybody. As far as I'm concerned

1610
02:24:29,600 --> 02:24:33,400
there's two things that I know when I have a good tourney. I come out paid and

1611
02:24:33,400 --> 02:24:41,720
when I'm done back home there are panties on my drawer. I don't know it's

1612
02:24:41,720 --> 02:24:46,200
kind of hard to say if obviously if we're going back about five years ago

1613
02:24:46,200 --> 02:24:50,320
tournaments were like a big thing because like you know we were trying to

1614
02:24:50,320 --> 02:24:54,520
promote the game we were trying to like get people aware of this and so like no

1615
02:24:54,520 --> 02:24:57,320
I mean we took tournaments seriously we figured you know we had to put our best

1616
02:24:57,320 --> 02:25:00,840
foot forward to make this game look good and say like hey this is something

1617
02:25:00,840 --> 02:25:05,320
everyone can enjoy and all that good stuff and so it was sort of fun but when

1618
02:25:05,320 --> 02:25:08,160
I got to my first tournament I won and like by that I think that just kind of

1619
02:25:08,160 --> 02:25:11,040
like maybe see tournaments a whole different way like I had to go out there

1620
02:25:11,040 --> 02:25:13,400
and I had to win, I wasn't out there to,

1621
02:25:13,400 --> 02:25:14,760
I mean, yeah, I was out there to have fun

1622
02:25:14,760 --> 02:25:16,120
and, you know, socialize and promote it,

1623
02:25:16,120 --> 02:25:17,520
but when all was said and done,

1624
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:20,080
I didn't drive down five hours to LA to be second place

1625
02:25:20,080 --> 02:25:22,460
or to be, you know, to have a good show.

1626
02:25:22,460 --> 02:25:23,300
Oh, snap.

1627
02:25:23,300 --> 02:25:24,120
You know, screw that.

1628
02:25:24,120 --> 02:25:27,960
But, so yeah, after all, you know, tourneys,

1629
02:25:27,960 --> 02:25:29,240
you know, yeah, I got bigger prizes,

1630
02:25:29,240 --> 02:25:31,680
got my solo machine, got my popping music controller

1631
02:25:31,680 --> 02:25:34,060
at the last tourney, which is pretty dope, by the way.

1632
02:25:34,060 --> 02:25:35,420
Thank you, desktop arcade.

1633
02:25:36,800 --> 02:25:38,440
I would say as far as organizing a tourney,

1634
02:25:38,440 --> 02:25:40,200
those things are not fun.

1635
02:25:40,200 --> 02:25:45,560
Yeah, organizers are not that great. I think perfect attack attorneys are fucking boring as hell

1636
02:25:46,680 --> 02:25:48,680
because it's I it's

1637
02:25:49,800 --> 02:25:52,560
Yeah, there's just basically nothing new you can put to PA

1638
02:25:52,560 --> 02:25:58,280
I mean, yeah, you could put on different modifiers, but then it's like you're not really gauging someone's perfect attack ability

1639
02:25:58,280 --> 02:26:02,880
You're gauging their improv, you know, they're they're sight reading more or less, which is not a bad thing

1640
02:26:02,880 --> 02:26:05,480
I mean, it's something that should be tested at the same time

1641
02:26:05,480 --> 02:26:13,480
It's kind of just kind of gone to the wayside. It's boring in my opinion. At least with freestyle, there's that chance you can see something new and something cool.

1642
02:26:13,480 --> 02:26:19,480
But tournaments are pretty fun if you just don't hang around the venue too long.

1643
02:26:19,480 --> 02:26:31,480
DDR tournaments for me are about bringing a lot of Febreze and a Super Soaker to give some of these kids a bath.

1644
02:26:31,480 --> 02:26:52,480
No, I'm kidding. Actually, I'm not. But, you know, DDR tournaments, it's all about community to me, and I could give a shit about who's winning the tournament, and I've participated in tournaments, and I've lost big. I've done decent in some as well, but to me, yes, to me it's about making people know who I am.

1645
02:26:52,480 --> 02:27:02,480
And I'll tell you what, after the March Madness where we had DDR Idol, you know who I am.

1646
02:27:02,480 --> 02:27:08,480
It's about making your DDR penis as big as possible.

1647
02:27:08,480 --> 02:27:10,480
We need to do DDR Idol again.

1648
02:27:10,480 --> 02:27:14,480
Are you actually going to come back or is Dr. Forrest going to come back?

1649
02:27:14,480 --> 02:27:19,480
The good doctor is thinking about it. You just need something to get him out of the closet again.

1650
02:27:19,480 --> 02:27:32,480
Remember that in my tournament, you guys do improv with a prop, that's a new thing I'm putting up for freestyle. Improvision with a prop.

1651
02:27:32,480 --> 02:27:35,480
I'll talk to the good doctor about it, we'll see what he comes up with.

1652
02:27:35,480 --> 02:27:38,480
Or you're probably saving up for DDR History X.

1653
02:27:38,480 --> 02:27:45,480
I don't want to beat the Dr. Dick thing into the ground though, I'm only going to use him on a rainy day.

1654
02:27:45,480 --> 02:27:48,480
How can you not?

1655
02:27:48,480 --> 02:27:53,480
We'll see, we'll see. Alright, uh, SharkSkrull, anything you wanted to add to this discussion?

1656
02:27:53,480 --> 02:28:03,480
What is a tournament like? Yes. Okay, find my friends, jabber jabber jabber, have they started yet? Jabber jabber jabber, another hour. Have they started yet? Jabber jabber jabber.

1657
02:28:03,480 --> 02:28:09,480
Oh, there's a routine, who's on? Oh, we just missed the entire thing, oh well. That's it.

1658
02:28:09,480 --> 02:28:14,480
And most of the time it involves doing something completely unrelated to DDR, like actually mini-golfing.

1659
02:28:14,480 --> 02:28:19,500
By the way, SharkSkrull and I met for the first time at a DDR tournament.

1660
02:28:19,500 --> 02:28:20,900
Just jabber jabber jabber.

1661
02:28:20,900 --> 02:28:21,900
That's right.

1662
02:28:21,900 --> 02:28:24,800
Cause DarkSakura and I were pissed that we screwed up on PA.

1663
02:28:24,800 --> 02:28:25,800
So we talked...

1664
02:28:25,800 --> 02:28:26,800
No, I met you before the PA.

1665
02:28:26,800 --> 02:28:28,080
Cause I remember you guys went to go get the bats.

1666
02:28:28,080 --> 02:28:29,080
That's...

1667
02:28:29,080 --> 02:28:30,080
Yeah!

1668
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:31,080
Remember?

1669
02:28:31,080 --> 02:28:32,080
And the toy horns.

1670
02:28:32,080 --> 02:28:35,320
But I remember we screwed up on PA so bad and we got your input on what we should do

1671
02:28:35,320 --> 02:28:36,320
for the freestyle.

1672
02:28:36,320 --> 02:28:40,840
And then like, me, DarkSakura, IguanaGirl, I remember we all went to the Rite Aid and

1673
02:28:40,840 --> 02:28:43,940
we got the bats and we did the Stomp to My Beat routine, which was the best routine I

1674
02:28:43,940 --> 02:28:48,500
was ever a part of by the way. Now the funny thing is I remember when I met you, and I

1675
02:28:48,500 --> 02:28:52,100
know I've told you this, but I'll tell the entire world this, my first two thoughts when

1676
02:28:52,100 --> 02:29:00,340
I met Rob. Wow, he's hot. Wow, he's gay. In that order, at that speed. Thank you. Thank

1677
02:29:00,340 --> 02:29:09,820
you, honey. I'm blushing. Stop, girl. See, you know what I'm talking about? Tournaments

1678
02:29:09,820 --> 02:29:13,900
being good for my ego. Anyway, uh, Loki, anything you want to add about DDR tournaments?

1679
02:29:13,900 --> 02:29:28,500
The, um, well, they're long and boring. Yeah, that's my take on them. They're like, um,

1680
02:29:28,500 --> 02:29:36,740
watching Titanic. It's like you keep expecting something, you keep expecting something cool

1681
02:29:36,740 --> 02:29:41,500
to happen, and someone says that there's something really good about it, but you just don't see

1682
02:29:41,500 --> 02:29:46,820
it no matter how long you watch it, and after you're done, you want your three hours back,

1683
02:29:46,820 --> 02:29:55,360
so that's pretty much, you know, pretty much how it is. Oh, and you know, you expect something

1684
02:29:55,360 --> 02:29:58,460
major to happen, like, you know, Leonardo DiCaprio to die, but then you find out he

1685
02:29:58,460 --> 02:30:04,500
just was acting, so, so it's like... And then, you know, we're all shocked to find out the

1686
02:30:04,500 --> 02:30:05,500
The boat sinks.

1687
02:30:05,500 --> 02:30:06,500
Oh my!

1688
02:30:06,500 --> 02:30:09,500
Thank you for ruining it for me, Rob!

1689
02:30:09,500 --> 02:30:13,760
Something completely unexpected happens, like the same people winning the tournaments all

1690
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:14,760
the time.

1691
02:30:14,760 --> 02:30:15,760
That's wonderful.

1692
02:30:15,760 --> 02:30:16,760
It's alright.

1693
02:30:16,760 --> 02:30:21,720
The doctor's going to make a comeback.

1694
02:30:21,720 --> 02:30:22,720
Just you wait.

1695
02:30:22,720 --> 02:30:26,100
Alright, anyway, let's move on.

1696
02:30:26,100 --> 02:30:28,860
So that was our DDR Freak post of the week.

1697
02:30:28,860 --> 02:30:29,860
There you have it.

1698
02:30:29,860 --> 02:30:31,780
Our DDR chit-chat post of the week.

1699
02:30:31,780 --> 02:30:41,780
If you keep posting over in DDR Freak on the DDR chit-chat boards, your post, if it's interesting enough, could be fodder for the show.

1700
02:30:41,780 --> 02:30:42,780
Alright, moving on.

1701
02:30:42,780 --> 02:30:44,780
Fodder for our ridicule.

1702
02:30:44,780 --> 02:30:47,780
Let's get into the FUs of the week.

1703
02:30:47,780 --> 02:30:51,780
Jamie, why is it that we have to do these FUs every single week?

1704
02:30:51,780 --> 02:30:54,780
Because life is a big stinking pile of shit.

1705
02:30:54,780 --> 02:31:17,200
An F.U. goes toward the entirety of my week since Wednesday for getting 3 hours of sleep

1706
02:31:17,200 --> 02:31:20,060
in as many days

1707
02:31:20,060 --> 02:31:24,380
uh... for being an emotional wreck for the past few days

1708
02:31:24,380 --> 02:31:26,680
uh... and if you too

1709
02:31:26,680 --> 02:31:30,880
uh... basically almost having to go find my own damn apartment

1710
02:31:30,880 --> 02:31:36,040
uh... to being harassed by the cops at Denny's

1711
02:31:36,040 --> 02:31:41,480
over an open confrontation

1712
02:31:41,480 --> 02:31:42,300
it's not funny

1713
02:31:42,300 --> 02:31:44,080
it's really serious

1714
02:31:44,080 --> 02:31:46,540
uh...

1715
02:31:46,540 --> 02:31:48,820
just F you to all that

1716
02:31:48,820 --> 02:31:52,260
and having to compromise

1717
02:31:52,260 --> 02:31:54,420
for a worthy cause

1718
02:31:54,420 --> 02:31:56,860
that's it, that's all I'm gonna say

1719
02:31:56,860 --> 02:31:58,940
alright then we'll move on to

1720
02:31:58,940 --> 02:32:03,340
Loki

1721
02:32:03,340 --> 02:32:06,820
first off, thank you to myself for having to buy another fucking hard drive for

1722
02:32:06,820 --> 02:32:08,580
this god damn computer

1723
02:32:08,580 --> 02:32:12,020
because I didn't calculate the voltage

1724
02:32:12,020 --> 02:32:14,380
needed for these things so

1725
02:32:14,380 --> 02:32:17,980
you know one rail of the power supply would have been maxed out if I bought

1726
02:32:17,980 --> 02:32:22,540
this other things basically you plug in a USB anything and the computer crashes

1727
02:32:22,540 --> 02:32:26,320
so that would have sucked but I got a larger hard drive out of it now I have

1728
02:32:26,320 --> 02:32:30,420
this really small 30 gig laptop hard drive that I have no fucking clue I'm

1729
02:32:30,420 --> 02:32:35,820
gonna do it and fuck you this goddamn slow people in front of me today while I

1730
02:32:35,820 --> 02:32:41,020
was coming home you were literally driving like 20 miles an hour and 50

1731
02:32:41,020 --> 02:32:45,380
mile an hour area. I drive by you and guess what, you're old.

1732
02:32:45,380 --> 02:32:48,460
There's a shocker. Seriously,

1733
02:32:48,460 --> 02:32:52,140
honestly, driving slower will not get you...

1734
02:32:52,140 --> 02:32:55,380
will not let you live longer, basically.

1735
02:32:55,380 --> 02:32:58,620
You cannot slow down time. So please,

1736
02:32:58,620 --> 02:33:02,180
drive the speed limit or faster. May I add one?

1737
02:33:02,180 --> 02:33:06,020
A few people with halogen headlights, thank you. Oh yes,

1738
02:33:06,020 --> 02:33:10,140
I'd like to second that. Nothing that I like more than having the sun

1739
02:33:10,140 --> 02:33:15,840
staring at me through my back window you know cuz I'm glad you can see five miles

1740
02:33:15,840 --> 02:33:19,840
in front of you but I can't even see two feet in front of me because your lights

1741
02:33:19,840 --> 02:33:25,020
are burning my retinas I'm sorry but you know I fucking hate all these trucks

1742
02:33:25,020 --> 02:33:29,280
with like fog lamps and shit on them they have so much you know fucking light

1743
02:33:29,280 --> 02:33:34,360
coming out of them I literally I could see them cutting a hole in the fog you

1744
02:33:34,360 --> 02:33:39,440
know literally just evaporating right in front of them it's just nuts no wonder

1745
02:33:39,440 --> 02:33:43,300
their tears fucking, you know, get hit by cars because they stare into the headlights.

1746
02:33:43,300 --> 02:33:50,300
They like literally go blind. They're just like brain shocked. So that fucking sucks.

1747
02:33:51,900 --> 02:33:55,820
And just basically, you know, fuck you do, this stupid Dremel attachment that I have,

1748
02:33:55,820 --> 02:34:02,820
this little flex shaft thing that supposedly allows you to use a Dremel tool in like really

1749
02:34:02,940 --> 02:34:09,220
tight places and stuff. But the goddamn thing, you know, I put the bit inside of it and it

1750
02:34:09,220 --> 02:34:15,040
threw the god damn saw blade out at me so that sucked

1751
02:34:15,040 --> 02:34:22,040
I don't want to hear any of your giggling over a flex shaft in tight places

1752
02:34:22,040 --> 02:34:24,720
the hell with you people

1753
02:34:24,720 --> 02:34:31,560
you're saying about talking about putting things in tight places in this crowd

1754
02:34:31,560 --> 02:34:34,960
I know, that sounds like fun girl

1755
02:34:34,960 --> 02:34:40,960
And a Final Fantasy-related, um, F.U. to this guy named Warchief, who is a complete moron,

1756
02:34:40,960 --> 02:34:43,960
who I literally think is retarded, and doesn't speak English.

1757
02:34:43,960 --> 02:34:47,960
So... Way to go, retarded people.

1758
02:34:47,960 --> 02:34:50,960
D'oh! Final Fantasy fun!

1759
02:34:50,960 --> 02:34:53,960
So, um...

1760
02:34:53,960 --> 02:34:54,960
Yay.

1761
02:34:54,960 --> 02:34:56,960
So, the hell with all that.

1762
02:34:56,960 --> 02:34:59,960
Um, yeah, really, it's been a pretty, um, decent week, though.

1763
02:34:59,960 --> 02:35:06,960
I'm done.

1764
02:35:09,960 --> 02:35:15,360
Uh, an F.U. to my mouse that just decided to die on me while, uh, so I can't control the

1765
02:35:15,360 --> 02:35:19,800
show right now except with the keyboard. So this is gonna be an interesting, uh, second

1766
02:35:19,800 --> 02:35:22,940
half of the show. I, I've just gotta go run and get the spare battery, so I gotta keep

1767
02:35:22,940 --> 02:35:29,560
my F.U.s kinda short. Um, F.U. to the Valero that just opened up, uh, uh, literally across

1768
02:35:29,560 --> 02:35:32,160
the street I don't know if you notice they've been building a gas station

1769
02:35:32,160 --> 02:35:35,440
across the street just to set this up the orange lounge studios are in the

1770
02:35:35,440 --> 02:35:39,360
middle of fucking nowhere okay and they just finally built a gas station like

1771
02:35:39,360 --> 02:35:42,780
literally right across the street from us but now it has a mini-mart and of

1772
02:35:42,780 --> 02:35:46,740
course these mini-marts are gonna be freaking marked up to all hell but it's

1773
02:35:46,740 --> 02:35:51,000
so convenient so now I'm gonna end up paying like five dollars for 12 pack of

1774
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:57,740
Pepsi because well shit it's right across the street and I'm lazy also an

1775
02:35:57,740 --> 02:36:02,980
FU to my low alcohol tolerance but you know I think I think I did pretty good

1776
02:36:02,980 --> 02:36:06,300
this week all things considered and that's all I'm gonna say we're gonna

1777
02:36:06,300 --> 02:36:09,620
move on moving on who's got the mic over there yeah I guess we might as well

1778
02:36:09,620 --> 02:36:14,180
start it off with explicit remember it's a three-hour show buddy all right good

1779
02:36:14,180 --> 02:36:20,300
did it from the previous weeks have not been saying F use a big F you goes to

1780
02:36:20,300 --> 02:36:26,060
almost everybody who keeps calling that my goddamn term it's pissed just cuz it

1781
02:36:26,060 --> 02:36:30,060
Just cuz some people spell this Paradise Island, Sacktown Smackdown.

1782
02:36:31,060 --> 02:36:35,060
Doesn't mean it is called piss, just called Sacktown Smackdown.

1783
02:36:36,060 --> 02:36:39,060
Since when did we have a piss attack?

1784
02:36:40,060 --> 02:36:41,060
Ooh, I'm on a perfect...

1785
02:36:41,060 --> 02:36:45,060
I don't know, the first Sacramento attorney I remember was called Scat, so...

1786
02:36:46,060 --> 02:36:48,060
That was not my idea.

1787
02:36:48,060 --> 02:36:56,300
But on an odd enough note, I actually found two of the scat t-shirts in my closet while

1788
02:36:56,300 --> 02:37:00,860
looking for stuff, so maybe we'll fill it out as a surprise.

1789
02:37:00,860 --> 02:37:04,460
T-shirts from the bottom of my closet.

1790
02:37:04,460 --> 02:37:05,460
The mouse is fixed.

1791
02:37:05,460 --> 02:37:06,460
Thank you.

1792
02:37:06,460 --> 02:37:14,300
Another F.D. ghost is someone putting a fucking glass, a fucking, um, snowy ball on the fucking

1793
02:37:14,300 --> 02:37:15,300
road again.

1794
02:37:15,300 --> 02:37:17,300
What am I supposed to do, rush?

1795
02:37:19,300 --> 02:37:26,300
Don't fucking ask. I drive back and forth every day and I see someone throw a damn bottle out of nowhere.

1796
02:37:26,300 --> 02:37:28,300
Who the hell do you think you are?

1797
02:37:28,300 --> 02:37:34,300
This used to be the rush of $1,000 fine if you throw anything out the window.

1798
02:37:34,300 --> 02:37:36,300
If you get caught.

1799
02:37:36,300 --> 02:37:42,300
Yeah, if you get caught, but it's because the cops are so lazy eating their fucking 12 donuts.

1800
02:37:42,300 --> 02:37:45,820
It doesn't- oh, Krispy Kreme donuts, ooh! The middle!

1801
02:37:45,820 --> 02:37:50,460
Hey, now, now, now, don't be getting, you know, mad at cops for eating donuts.

1802
02:37:50,460 --> 02:37:52,860
They have to have breakfast just like you and me.

1803
02:37:52,860 --> 02:37:58,780
And, goddammit, if they decide to, you know, frequent a donut place, then that's their god-given right.

1804
02:37:58,780 --> 02:38:01,260
Ha ha ha! Yeah...

1805
02:38:01,260 --> 02:38:06,940
Yeah, I'm not gonna- I'm not gonna go with the friggin' donut issue of seeing a cop-

1806
02:38:06,940 --> 02:38:09,900
It's donuts' faults for being so goddamn delicious!

1807
02:38:09,900 --> 02:38:13,900
They have two damn rounds as well.

1808
02:38:13,900 --> 02:38:16,900
I'm not gonna go...

1809
02:38:16,900 --> 02:38:20,900
Let me see, another FD goes to GDR UK for shutting down, of course.

1810
02:38:20,900 --> 02:38:24,900
He's got people trying to spy over MP3s and shit.

1811
02:38:24,900 --> 02:38:32,900
But like I stated earlier, I said, you can always file a calendar to lawsuit for barging in our privacy and shit.

1812
02:38:32,900 --> 02:38:36,900
Always forgiving.

1813
02:38:36,900 --> 02:38:39,300
And if not, really, we'll beat that shit out of him.

1814
02:38:40,300 --> 02:38:41,900
Problem solved.

1815
02:38:42,900 --> 02:38:44,900
Or just kill him if we can't beat him up.

1816
02:38:45,900 --> 02:38:50,900
Uh, yeah, to be continued, because I wanted to keep doing a short show.

1817
02:38:50,900 --> 02:38:54,900
Oh, good, okay, good. Only ten minutes this week, explicit. Appreciate it, I'm kidding.

1818
02:38:54,900 --> 02:38:55,900
Mel B!

1819
02:38:55,900 --> 02:39:00,900
Oh, gosh, uh, after you go to my, uh, workplace over at NAMCO,

1820
02:39:00,900 --> 02:39:04,900
real smooth to have a QA department of about, oh, maybe 60 strong or so,

1821
02:39:04,900 --> 02:39:08,900
and have like six computers for all of us to use.

1822
02:39:08,900 --> 02:39:12,900
Especially more for the bug, like a really big project here.

1823
02:39:12,900 --> 02:39:16,900
And there's just so many crashes that they kind of wonder why there's like ten duplicate bugs

1824
02:39:16,900 --> 02:39:20,900
in like the system. Because no one can go to their own computer,

1825
02:39:20,900 --> 02:39:24,900
look up the PC, see if it's been written already, and just everything is so chaotic.

1826
02:39:24,900 --> 02:39:28,900
So uh yeah, they just need to get their act together and uh, you know, they need to just

1827
02:39:28,900 --> 02:39:32,900
redevelop the place and make it even more Pac-Man-ish. Or you know, at least

1828
02:39:32,900 --> 02:39:37,900
They give us, you know, like Friday, I think Friday, Katamari days, we can like roll our boxes up or something, that'd be pretty nice.

1829
02:39:37,900 --> 02:39:39,900
Do you have Katamari stress balls?

1830
02:39:39,900 --> 02:39:41,900
Maybe.

1831
02:39:43,900 --> 02:39:53,900
Yeah, there's, I'm actually, um, funny enough, one of the people who I know at Namco just granted some Konami work in the marketing division, so I'm gonna try to see if she can do my hookups and stuff.

1832
02:39:53,900 --> 02:39:57,900
And she's Japanese too, so that's a double quad.

1833
02:39:57,900 --> 02:40:03,900
I did find out that, for the LucasArts people, they get thermal nuclear detonator truffles.

1834
02:40:05,900 --> 02:40:12,900
Ah yeah, so yeah, happy to them. Happy to, um, happy to myself for losing my damn keys on Friday night.

1835
02:40:12,900 --> 02:40:18,900
Apparently what happened was, it ended up in Sharp's girl's handbag somehow. I don't know if she had a hand in this.

1836
02:40:18,900 --> 02:40:25,900
I swear to you, I had the bag on your chair. You threw the keys on the chair when you walked in the door and it fell on my bag.

1837
02:40:25,900 --> 02:40:29,900
But you're the responsible one, you should know what you think.

1838
02:40:29,900 --> 02:40:33,900
So yeah, thank you to myself for just losing my keys like I always do.

1839
02:40:33,900 --> 02:40:35,900
Thank God I actually found it.

1840
02:40:35,900 --> 02:40:37,900
But uh, that's about it.

1841
02:40:37,900 --> 02:40:40,900
Life is actually alright otherwise, this week.

1842
02:40:40,900 --> 02:40:42,900
Sharks, girl.

1843
02:40:42,900 --> 02:40:46,900
I don't really have anything, I'm feeling pretty mellow.

1844
02:40:46,900 --> 02:40:49,900
F you to not being happy, or not being angsty.

1845
02:40:49,900 --> 02:40:51,900
F you to being happy and not being angsty.

1846
02:40:51,900 --> 02:40:55,900
Well, F.U. to you for giving me an F.U. to her.

1847
02:40:55,900 --> 02:40:59,900
That's what I was looking for. All right. Nellie, any F.U.s?

1848
02:40:59,900 --> 02:41:04,900
I see you just putting the mic in my face. I don't know if that's really what you're doing.

1849
02:41:04,900 --> 02:41:05,900
I have one to add.

1850
02:41:05,900 --> 02:41:08,900
Ooh, she's getting snippy with me. All right.

1851
02:41:08,900 --> 02:41:10,900
I have one to add, actually.

1852
02:41:10,900 --> 02:41:16,900
An F.U. to LucasArts for ending my friend's assignment so I can't go to the Skywalker Ranch anymore.

1853
02:41:16,900 --> 02:41:20,100
he heard the show and heard that you were gonna fling meatloaf at him

1854
02:41:20,100 --> 02:41:23,780
or whatever it was you were eating that yeah well fuck you George Lucas

1855
02:41:23,780 --> 02:41:27,820
thank you for ruining an entire continuity that I grew up with

1856
02:41:27,820 --> 02:41:33,900
exactly okay Star Wars was my first movie ever

1857
02:41:33,900 --> 02:41:37,940
I was one and my mom drug me screaming to the movie theater

1858
02:41:37,940 --> 02:41:41,140
however I would be quiet whenever Darth Vader was on the screen that would show

1859
02:41:41,140 --> 02:41:43,020
that I was meant to have a life of evil

1860
02:41:43,020 --> 02:41:54,020
Um, but uh, just, screw him, you know? He's, he's messed with my childhood.

1861
02:41:54,020 --> 02:42:01,020
But he did cast Natalie Portman in his movies. I'm gay and I'd hit that.

1862
02:42:01,020 --> 02:42:06,020
And she's one of five people in that movie who have any talent.

1863
02:42:06,020 --> 02:42:08,020
Very true.

1864
02:42:08,020 --> 02:42:12,020
Alright, now now man, that Chewbacca, that's awesome.

1865
02:42:12,020 --> 02:42:14,020
I am looking forward to seeing the Wookie planet though.

1866
02:42:15,020 --> 02:42:18,020
Oh god, they get out of the ship, they're all,

1867
02:42:18,020 --> 02:42:19,020
they're all, what the hell's going on?

1868
02:42:21,020 --> 02:42:22,020
It's just all that.

1869
02:42:24,020 --> 02:42:25,020
Go back, it's too loud.

1870
02:42:29,020 --> 02:42:31,020
It's all it is, it's just so annoying.

1871
02:42:33,020 --> 02:42:35,020
It's like even more annoying than Jar Jar Binks,

1872
02:42:35,020 --> 02:42:42,800
are being. It just sounds like one giant plant of retards. Alright, let's move on to the

1873
02:42:42,800 --> 02:42:48,560
chatroom FUs because we've got quite a few tonight. Darkknight says, F you to cold weather

1874
02:42:48,560 --> 02:42:56,800
and ice. Peralta says, F you to the people who hate my little Euro car with the bright

1875
02:42:56,800 --> 02:43:00,080

02:47:47,740 --> 02:47:51,740
Since a lot of my major is now graphic arts and taught in the Mac Lab.

02:47:51,740 --> 02:47:55,740
Alright.

1926
02:47:55,740 --> 02:47:59,740
And I think that's it.

1927
02:47:59,740 --> 02:48:03,740
Thank you guys for participating in tonight's FUs of the Week. Oh no wait! I had one more!

1928
02:48:03,740 --> 02:48:07,740
There was one more that came in over email. I forgot about that because it came from

1929
02:48:07,740 --> 02:48:11,740
Misty. She sent it on her cell phone to my email address.

1930
02:48:11,740 --> 02:48:15,740

1935
02:48:31,860 --> 02:48:37,340
the blackboard because they didn't know where to find Internet Explorer I just

1936
02:48:37,340 --> 02:48:39,340
I laughed.

1937
02:48:39,340 --> 02:48:41,340
Silly PC people.

1938
02:48:41,340 --> 02:48:43,340
I laughed.

1939
02:48:43,340 --> 02:48:48,340
For a very long time. My first computer was one of those old Apple IIe.

1940
02:48:48,340 --> 02:48:50,340
Tall, tall ones.

1941
02:48:50,340 --> 02:48:52,340
It's like, this thing's taller than my head.

1942
02:48:52,340 --> 02:48:54,340
I love Oregon Trail.

1943
02:48:54,340 --> 02:48:55,340
Anyways...

1944
02:48:55,340 --> 02:48:59,340
As long as we're playing Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego on those things.

1945
02:48:59,340 --> 02:49:04,340
As I was going to say before about the retarded people at the Chinese food place,

1946
02:49:04,340 --> 02:49:07,560
there was actually some of those more retarded than the sample lady

1947
02:49:07,560 --> 02:49:11,820
and that was this person i don't even know who she was she wasn't even asian but

1948
02:49:11,820 --> 02:49:14,040
i was like i'm all i want ace

1949
02:49:14,040 --> 02:49:18,060

1956
02:49:31,640 --> 02:49:37,480

1960
02:49:59,960 --> 02:50:24,960
Where are Laker's Jordan?

1961
02:50:29,960 --> 02:50:34,000
a break, and when we come back, a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge. We have a little bit

1962
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:37,400
of time for Ask Orange Lounge, or you could ask Mel B, Sharks Girl, or Explicit. You could

1963
02:50:37,400 --> 02:50:44,400
ask, maybe you could ask Nellie, that doesn't mean she'll answer you. You can ask, no, never

1964
02:50:45,400 --> 02:50:52,120
mind. Alright, anyway. How much money would it take for you to rape Robin? Alright. Ask

1965
02:50:52,120 --> 02:50:54,720
Orange Lounge when we come back for a little bit, and then we're gonna put the nail in

1966
02:50:54,720 --> 02:50:59,600
the coffin of the show. In this break, we're gonna do a two-song break featuring some requests,

1967
02:50:59,600 --> 02:51:03,240
some song that you guys have been requesting all night long. Here you go. We're gonna start

1968
02:51:03,240 --> 02:51:08,200
it off with a little bit of a ballad. So, get out the lighters and slow dance to this

1969
02:51:08,200 --> 02:51:09,200
one.

1970
02:51:09,200 --> 02:51:26,200
Love you baby, the place is true, just give me a chance to prove I'm leaving you

1971
02:51:26,200 --> 02:51:32,200
Oh baby, I'm never gonna end up to cry

1972
02:51:32,200 --> 02:51:36,200
All I want to do is tell you please

1973
02:51:36,200 --> 02:51:41,200
Love is the magic bird for us to see

1974
02:51:41,200 --> 02:51:47,200
Together we can see the night

1975
02:51:47,200 --> 02:51:51,200
The moon doesn't last that big

1976
02:51:51,200 --> 02:51:55,200
The only earth can know

1977
02:51:55,200 --> 02:51:59,200
The moon doesn't last that big

1978
02:51:59,200 --> 02:52:12,200
When you tell me you love me, you can be my love again

1979
02:52:12,200 --> 02:52:20,200
Come and join me, come and join me

1980
02:52:20,200 --> 02:52:24,200
I will tell you how I feel

1981
02:52:24,200 --> 02:52:27,200
You're in my mind every day

1982
02:52:27,200 --> 02:52:37,200
I will tell you how I feel

1983
02:52:37,200 --> 02:52:40,200
When, when, when you say hello

1984
02:52:40,200 --> 02:52:43,200
Tell me, girl, don't you know

1985
02:52:47,200 --> 02:52:48,200
Now who that is?

1986
02:52:48,200 --> 02:52:49,200
That my baby mama

1987
02:53:49,200 --> 02:53:51,760
If I catch disease, round town sources like a farmer

1988
02:53:51,760 --> 02:53:53,720
You better beware your baby mama

1989
02:53:53,720 --> 02:53:54,460
Who that is?

1990
02:53:54,460 --> 02:53:55,200
My baby momma

1991
02:53:55,200 --> 02:53:56,200
No, who that is?

1992
02:53:56,200 --> 02:53:57,000
My baby momma

1993
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:58,100
Now who that is?

1994
02:53:58,100 --> 02:53:58,600
Baby momma

1995
02:53:58,600 --> 02:53:59,560
No, who that is?

1996
02:53:59,560 --> 02:54:00,400
My baby momma

1997
02:54:00,400 --> 02:54:01,280
Now who that is?

1998
02:54:01,280 --> 02:54:02,100
My baby momma

1999
02:54:02,100 --> 02:54:02,960
No, who that is?

2000
02:54:02,960 --> 02:54:03,900
My baby momma

2001
02:54:03,900 --> 02:54:04,800
Now who that is?

2002
02:54:04,800 --> 02:54:05,680
My baby momma

2003
02:54:05,680 --> 02:54:06,540
No, who that is?

2004
02:54:06,540 --> 02:54:07,900
My baby momma

2005
02:54:07,900 --> 02:54:32,080
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

2006
02:54:32,080 --> 02:54:41,440
We are back here on Orange Lounge radio, and I was going to do Ask Orange Lounge, but nobody

2007
02:54:41,440 --> 02:54:43,440
submitted a question yet, so I don't know what we're going to do.

2008
02:54:43,440 --> 02:54:44,440
I have a question.

2009
02:54:44,440 --> 02:54:45,440
Well, hold on.

2010
02:54:45,440 --> 02:54:46,440
We've got to do the music.

2011
02:54:46,440 --> 02:54:47,440
Just a minute here.

2012
02:54:47,440 --> 02:54:56,000
Okay, I just put it there in chat, a reminder of how to Ask Orange Lounge, if you would

2013
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:57,000
like.

2014
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:58,720
Yeah, ask us a question, bitches.

2015
02:54:58,720 --> 02:55:04,720
Since we don't have any questions yet, what we'll do is we'll allow somebody in the room to ask other folks in the room a question.

2016
02:55:04,720 --> 02:55:07,720
So, let me get the theme music so we can play.

2017
02:55:09,720 --> 02:55:10,720
Here we go.

2018
02:55:17,720 --> 02:55:20,720
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

2019
02:55:20,720 --> 02:55:24,720
What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

2020
02:55:24,720 --> 02:55:28,720
Will you rape me in a bus? Will you rape me in a car? Will you r-

2021
02:55:28,720 --> 02:55:30,720
Fuck it.

2022
02:55:38,720 --> 02:55:41,720
Uhh, Peralta has a question.

2023
02:55:41,720 --> 02:55:44,720
When will you report on Tony Hawk's latest game?

2024
02:55:46,720 --> 02:55:48,720
When monkeys fly out of my ass.

2025
02:55:48,720 --> 02:55:56,640
No, I, well, I like the Tony Hawk games, but they're just, they're too, um, heterosexual for this show.

2026
02:55:56,640 --> 02:55:57,920
I don't know, no, I'm kidding, I don't know.

2027
02:55:58,920 --> 02:56:02,520
When one magically appears on the hard drive of my HD loader.

2028
02:56:03,220 --> 02:56:07,120
When I magically get a chance to play it, I'll let you guys know what I think, I guess.

2029
02:56:07,120 --> 02:56:10,620
I need to play the Punisher, because you can kill people in, like, hundreds of different ways.

2030
02:56:11,620 --> 02:56:16,020
Including, like, taking their jaw, opening it up on a curb, and then smashing their skull down.

2031
02:56:16,020 --> 02:56:19,380
or throwing them through wood chippers or drill presses

2032
02:56:19,380 --> 02:56:23,700
or like many other ways. You can interrogate them over a roof by dangling

2033
02:56:23,700 --> 02:56:25,740
them by their feet and then you can let them go

2034
02:56:25,740 --> 02:56:29,900
and like a bunch of other fun stuff like that. It's like super violent and stuff.

2035
02:56:29,900 --> 02:56:32,940
I'm playing my favorite game already.

2036
02:56:32,940 --> 02:56:37,860
Peralta has a follow-up question. When will monkeys be flying out of Jamie's ass?

2037
02:56:37,860 --> 02:56:41,260
Hopefully never.

2038
02:56:41,260 --> 02:56:49,460
Alright, uh, Zerus says, why do so many people hate on My Baby, insert parent figure here,

2039
02:56:49,460 --> 02:56:51,700
My Baby Mama or My Baby Daddy?

2040
02:56:51,700 --> 02:56:55,500
I don't hate it, I just think we do play that song an awful lot, we're supposed to, you

2041
02:56:55,500 --> 02:56:57,480
know, that's supposed to be a rainy day song.

2042
02:56:57,480 --> 02:57:03,340
We need to do the more politically correct version, you know, uh, My Baby Non-Gender

2043
02:57:03,340 --> 02:57:06,440
Specific Parental Unit.

2044
02:57:06,440 --> 02:57:10,580
My Baby Parent, not...

2045
02:57:10,580 --> 02:57:16,300
I've been reading a lot of those politically correct bedtime stories, those little books.

2046
02:57:16,300 --> 02:57:21,540
And so, I was actually spending the other day trying to filk songs to do them politically

2047
02:57:21,540 --> 02:57:22,540
correct.

2048
02:57:22,540 --> 02:57:23,540
It didn't work.

2049
02:57:23,540 --> 02:57:29,500
Why does my baby have two mamas?

2050
02:57:29,500 --> 02:57:30,500
My baby mamas.

2051
02:57:30,500 --> 02:57:31,500
My baby mamas.

2052
02:57:31,500 --> 02:57:32,500
Alright.

2053
02:57:32,500 --> 02:57:35,860
I'm going to kind of tear through these because suddenly we're getting like eight questions.

2054
02:57:35,860 --> 02:57:36,860
It's crazy.

2055
02:57:36,860 --> 02:57:39,060
So I've got to burn through these because we've only got a little show left here.

2056
02:57:39,060 --> 02:57:43,640
K-Dash wants to know, what is the best way to pick up chicks?

2057
02:57:43,640 --> 02:57:44,640
Show him your wallet.

2058
02:57:44,640 --> 02:57:47,320
Lift them by the shoulders.

2059
02:57:47,320 --> 02:57:48,320
A backhoe.

2060
02:57:48,320 --> 02:57:49,320
Oh.

2061
02:57:49,320 --> 02:57:51,780
Tell him you're a great freestyler.

2062
02:57:51,780 --> 02:57:55,760
When he, well, when he says chicks, he means chicks at DDR attorneys.

2063
02:57:55,760 --> 02:57:57,360
Again, show him your wallet.

2064
02:57:57,360 --> 02:58:01,720
Okay, unless they're competing, they're usually there to watch their boyfriends.

2065
02:58:01,720 --> 02:58:03,560
Is there a barnyard at tournaments?

2066
02:58:03,560 --> 02:58:04,560
Little chicks?

2067
02:58:04,560 --> 02:58:07,320
Cheep, cheep, cheep, ha, ha, ha.

2068
02:58:07,320 --> 02:58:08,320
Boo!

2069
02:58:08,320 --> 02:58:20,320
Do I have any serious advice? You know what? Just go up and say hi. Girls are impressed with a guy with balls. Just go up and say hi.

2070
02:58:20,320 --> 02:58:26,320
Don't say hi repeatedly. If she walks away, don't follow her, because that's stalking.

2071
02:58:26,320 --> 02:58:36,560
Well, if she just doesn't say anything to you, but doesn't move, maybe she didn't hear

2072
02:58:36,560 --> 02:58:37,560
you.

2073
02:58:37,560 --> 02:58:38,560
That could be.

2074
02:58:38,560 --> 02:58:39,800
Or she's pointedly ignoring you.

2075
02:58:39,800 --> 02:58:40,800
Or she's deaf.

2076
02:58:40,800 --> 02:58:41,800
Or dead.

2077
02:58:41,800 --> 02:58:42,800
Or dead.

2078
02:58:42,800 --> 02:58:47,960
A DDR tournament is not a good place to talk to women because it's so fucking loud there.

2079
02:58:47,960 --> 02:58:50,080
Wait until they go outside.

2080
02:58:50,080 --> 02:58:57,680
casually stand there and go, oh hi, I saw you inside. Whip it out! If she walks up to

2081
02:58:57,680 --> 02:59:01,440
you and does the Margaret Cho pick up line, you know you've got it made. Whip it out and

2082
02:59:01,440 --> 02:59:08,120
tell her to suck it, it works every time. You know what line I'm referring to. Stick

2083
02:59:08,120 --> 02:59:16,860
it in! I didn't order this pizza with SUFFAGE! Phoenix says, who are the people on the couch?

2084
02:59:16,860 --> 02:59:23,500
From left to right, Explicit, Mel B, and Sharks Girl.

2085
02:59:23,500 --> 02:59:31,860
Illusion says, what the hell, read any good books lately that aren't of the homoerotic

2086
02:59:31,860 --> 02:59:34,980
variety aka Anne Rice novels?

2087
02:59:34,980 --> 02:59:40,540
Actually it's funny, my bathroom reading right now isn't an Anne Rice novel.

2088
02:59:40,540 --> 02:59:47,540
I'm reading the sequel to Blackwood Farm.

2089
02:59:51,140 --> 02:59:54,380
But it's all from Lestat's point of view, which I think he's absolutely

2090
02:59:54,380 --> 02:59:55,020
hilarious.

2091
02:59:55,020 --> 02:59:58,580
If you want to know why people are busting up laughing, it's because somebody in chat said

2092
02:59:58,580 --> 03:00:01,860
DER attorneys are not a good place to talk to girls because they're

2093
03:00:01,860 --> 03:00:03,020
probably underage.

2094
03:00:03,020 --> 03:00:07,260
Anybody else reading any books you want to share?

2095
03:00:07,260 --> 03:00:09,760
I'm reading a book on how to start your own business.

2096
03:00:09,760 --> 03:00:14,760
Will Wheaton, just a geek. He's an awesome author and he's even funnier live.

2097
03:00:14,760 --> 03:00:15,760
That's hot.

2098
03:00:15,760 --> 03:00:18,760
And I'm actually reading Yao Ming's autobiography right now.

2099
03:00:18,760 --> 03:00:22,760
It's quite, quite interesting I must say, even if you're not a basketball fan.

2100
03:00:24,760 --> 03:00:25,760
Alright.

2101
03:00:25,760 --> 03:00:26,760
Part two.

2102
03:00:26,760 --> 03:00:28,760
Nelly says, Penthouse part two.

2103
03:00:28,760 --> 03:00:31,260
Darkknight says, about Mario DDR.

2104
03:00:31,260 --> 03:00:35,760
If they had no choice but to put a Max 300 style song in it using a Nintendo game song,

2105
03:00:35,760 --> 03:00:42,760
If a tree falls in the forest and no one's around, just admit it.

2106
03:01:05,760 --> 03:01:07,760
Does anyone care?

2107
03:01:07,760 --> 03:01:12,760
If a tree falls in the middle of the forest and nobody's around, nobody's still listening to internet radio.

2108
03:01:12,760 --> 03:01:19,760
I remember that in Family Guy. He's like, yeah, Phil fell down last week and he hasn't stopped talking about it.

2109
03:01:19,760 --> 03:01:28,760
Mikolatov has a question for Loki. Loki, why did you not include Strangers with Candy, the movie, as one of the must-see movies of the year?

2110
03:01:28,760 --> 03:01:36,560
year? Because I had to pick one, and, you know, Sin City was over Strangers with Candy.

2111
03:01:36,560 --> 03:01:40,960
I still want to see Constantine over Sin City. I will make Strangers with Candy my must-see

2112
03:01:40,960 --> 03:01:50,080
movie of the year. There you have it. I still want to see Constantine.

2113
03:01:50,080 --> 03:01:55,040
Legend of Zaku says, out of all the acts from last Tuesday's and Wednesday's American Idol,

2114
03:01:55,040 --> 03:01:59,180
Which do you think was the worst act and why? Did anybody actually watch it?

2115
03:01:59,920 --> 03:02:01,920
Who in here doesn't watch TV?

2116
03:02:02,100 --> 03:02:03,800
My hand is raised.

2117
03:02:03,800 --> 03:02:07,560
I watched it. I was here watching it, remember?

2118
03:02:07,980 --> 03:02:12,380
I think the last chick was cool because she was insane.

2119
03:02:13,180 --> 03:02:16,620
I would say the guy that was related to Toni Braxton, supposedly.

2120
03:02:20,040 --> 03:02:22,520
Who was the worst singer on American Idol on Tuesday or Wednesday?

2121
03:02:22,520 --> 03:02:27,040
Oh, it was the crazy girl who had multiple personalities and she had different voices

2122
03:02:27,040 --> 03:02:31,920
talking to her. That was hilarious. My favorite one, and Rob will agree with me,

2123
03:02:31,920 --> 03:02:37,640
is the one that she's like, Jesus gave me, or God gave me the sound of voice, or like

2124
03:02:37,640 --> 03:02:44,640
the gift of voice, and she's all, God wants me to sing for you, and then Simon's like,

2125
03:02:44,640 --> 03:02:49,760
God does not want you to win this competition.

2126
03:02:49,760 --> 03:02:53,200
SSJ100Matt says, why do only gay guys

2127
03:02:53,200 --> 03:02:56,520
and not hot girls get turned on by guys playing DDR?

2128
03:02:56,520 --> 03:03:00,680
Here's my answer to that. This is Murphy's Law in action because I, being a

2129
03:03:00,680 --> 03:03:01,360
gay man,

2130
03:03:01,360 --> 03:03:06,520
I only attract women playing DDR. So that's just the way life works, buddy.

2131
03:03:06,520 --> 03:03:10,720
Sorry, your non-preferred gender is the one that'll start hitting on you. It's just

2132
03:03:10,720 --> 03:03:13,800
life's funny. Oh, it says

2133
03:03:13,800 --> 03:03:17,120
sharks girl says on the contrary with your girl it's different

2134
03:03:17,120 --> 03:03:20,800
yes if you're a girl and you're playing any video game and you're any good at it

2135
03:03:20,800 --> 03:03:24,760
yeah you get some attention most of the time. Oh my god when I worked for

2136
03:03:24,760 --> 03:03:29,440
um cyber station. Walking around with the Pac-Man shirt

2137
03:03:29,440 --> 03:03:34,880
playing Tekken 3 back in the day. You've got boobs and you're good at games.

2138
03:03:34,880 --> 03:03:40,640
Marry me now. Yeah and I just kicked your ass. When I worked at the shark store wearing a hockey jersey

2139
03:03:40,640 --> 03:03:43,520
spouting facts and knowing more than the guys around

2140
03:03:43,520 --> 03:03:46,600
Oh dear God, it was crazy.

2141
03:03:46,600 --> 03:03:49,960
What would get the people is when I would accurately predict the next

2142
03:03:49,960 --> 03:03:52,920
character to come out because I would follow the Japanese machine

2143
03:03:52,920 --> 03:03:56,360
and actually they did three characters out of order.

2144
03:03:56,360 --> 03:04:02,720
I was playing Star Wars once and I had ten-year-olds boys that looked like they were about ready to propose marriage to me

2145
03:04:02,720 --> 03:04:06,920
because I was so good at it. I would put the cursor where characters were before they were there

2146
03:04:06,920 --> 03:04:10,120
because I had memorized all the patterns.

2147
03:04:10,120 --> 03:04:26,040
I think it's like a line that you hit depending on what type of group because you get the

2148
03:04:26,040 --> 03:04:30,920
worship in some groups and then you get the other way around in other groups is really

2149
03:04:30,920 --> 03:04:32,680
bad in Alabama.

2150
03:04:32,680 --> 03:04:37,760
I was just glad that my boyfriend at the time was as big of a nerd as I was and liked to

2151
03:04:37,760 --> 03:04:43,760
drink just as much as I did.

2152
03:04:43,760 --> 03:04:48,000
Alright we gotta wrap it up so one more question and then we're gonna put the nail in the coffin

2153
03:04:48,000 --> 03:04:49,000
on Ask Orange Lounge.

2154
03:04:49,000 --> 03:04:52,280
I apologize to those of you that were cutting off, we just did the questions in the order

2155
03:04:52,280 --> 03:04:54,120
we received them so you were towards the end.

2156
03:04:54,120 --> 03:04:55,120
Sorry guys.

2157
03:04:55,120 --> 03:05:00,360
DDR Angel wants to know, if MIST is like 20 years old and still very popular, what do

2158
03:05:00,360 --> 03:05:04,320
you think DDR or Bramani in general will be at its 20 year old birthday?

2159
03:05:04,320 --> 03:05:06,580
20 years old.

2160
03:05:06,580 --> 03:05:11,140
I think it'll be the thing that's going to be on VH1's I love the zeroes

2161
03:05:11,140 --> 03:05:13,140
and how Sparks is sitting there going

2162
03:05:13,140 --> 03:05:17,500
those crazy kids were playing that game with the flashing seizure lights and

2163
03:05:17,500 --> 03:05:21,300
and somewhere someone's still going to be raping the bar

2164
03:05:21,300 --> 03:05:23,640
uh... word

2165
03:05:23,640 --> 03:05:27,160
all right i think that uh... definitely sums it up

2166
03:05:27,160 --> 03:05:29,660
dark saccharine? I just had this vision of

2167
03:05:29,660 --> 03:05:32,180
this person twenty years from now

2168
03:05:32,180 --> 03:05:34,020
wait until everybody's gone

2169
03:05:34,020 --> 03:05:35,100
the lights are out

2170
03:05:35,100 --> 03:05:38,220
reached into their closet, pulling out one of those bars.

2171
03:05:38,220 --> 03:05:44,260
This is Orange Lounge Radio Live, this is episode 1048, and you're...

2172
03:05:44,260 --> 03:05:46,820
And I need a job!

2173
03:05:46,820 --> 03:05:47,580
Alright.

2174
03:05:47,580 --> 03:05:51,560
Well, our contract just ended for G5.

2175
03:05:51,560 --> 03:05:54,180
And you know, we've decided that we're going to go off on our own.

2176
03:05:54,180 --> 03:05:55,880
We're going to expand.

2177
03:05:55,880 --> 03:05:59,980
And you know, we just got done buying out 50 companies, and this one we're all

2178
03:05:59,980 --> 03:06:03,620
super successful and elitist we have people to do to you know pretend to be

2179
03:06:03,620 --> 03:06:08,220
us and in the latest ratings book we just got the latest ratings book and

2180
03:06:08,220 --> 03:06:13,860
look orange lounge radio has beaten g4 television in the ratings book and oh it

2181
03:06:13,860 --> 03:06:20,300
looks like the two guys tickling each other channel on live 365 also beat g4

2182
03:06:21,300 --> 03:06:28,620
in fact it looks like g4 came in next to last place and in last place the

2183
03:06:28,620 --> 03:06:36,180
microphone up a donkey's butt station. Hey, I like that station. Don't be dissing the

2184
03:06:36,180 --> 03:06:43,100
microphone up ass ass station. All right. We got to go around and get everybody's final

2185
03:06:43,100 --> 03:06:46,220
thoughts. Sorry to those questions we didn't get to. Explicit, your final thought.

2186
03:06:46,220 --> 03:06:54,580
There's nothing really, so. Mel B., your final thought.

2187
03:06:54,580 --> 03:06:57,580
Oh man, it's good to be back up in here.

2188
03:06:58,580 --> 03:07:01,580
I'm so boring, I don't have one.

2189
03:07:01,580 --> 03:07:03,580
Nellie, your final thought?

2190
03:07:03,580 --> 03:07:06,580
How much money would it take?

2191
03:07:06,580 --> 03:07:09,580
Yeah. Loki, your final thought?

2192
03:07:09,580 --> 03:07:15,580
Do you realize that on the internet, there are actually pictures of people eating babies?

2193
03:07:15,580 --> 03:07:19,580
I kid you not. I have seen pictures of a baby's soup.

2194
03:07:19,580 --> 03:07:34,580
Go to superzooie.com, that's S-U-P-E-R-Z-O-O-I.com. In the left-hand column there will be a picture thing, and click on the one that says Baby Soup, and it actually shows it.

2195
03:07:34,580 --> 03:07:40,580
My final thought is, why is he a co-host? Why? Why, why, why? Jamie?

2196
03:07:40,580 --> 03:07:46,580
My final thought was because he sat on the floor long enough to earn his spot.

2197
03:07:46,580 --> 03:07:50,580
Alright, final word of the show. Thank you guys very much for tuning in tonight.

And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

2206
03:09:09,380 --> 03:09:14,380
In dreams he came

2207
03:09:14,380 --> 03:09:18,380
That voice which calls to me

2208
03:09:18,380 --> 03:09:22,380
And speaks my name

2209
03:09:22,380 --> 03:09:26,380
And do I dream again

2210
03:09:26,380 --> 03:09:31,380
For now I find

2211
03:09:31,380 --> 03:09:38,380
The phantom of the opera is there

2212
03:09:38,380 --> 03:09:43,380
Inside my heart

2213
03:09:50,380 --> 03:09:54,380
Sing once again with me

2214
03:09:54,380 --> 03:09:58,380
Our screams duet

2215
03:09:58,380 --> 03:10:02,380
My power over you

2216
03:10:02,380 --> 03:10:06,380
Grows stronger yet

2217
03:10:06,380 --> 03:10:15,380
And though you turn from me to glance behind,

2218
03:10:15,380 --> 03:10:27,380
The time come of the opera is there inside your mind.

2219
03:10:27,380 --> 03:10:42,380
Those who have seen your face draw back in fear

2220
03:10:42,380 --> 03:10:46,380
I am the moth you wear

2221
03:10:46,380 --> 03:10:50,380
It's me they hear

2222
03:10:50,380 --> 03:10:59,380
My spirit and my voice in one combine

2223
03:10:59,380 --> 03:11:06,380
The circle of the operated

2224
03:11:06,380 --> 03:11:15,380
Inside my heart

2225
03:11:15,380 --> 03:11:23,380
Y vez do nando lo mio para

2226
03:11:30,380 --> 03:11:33,380
Hail, my angel of union

2227
03:11:33,380 --> 03:11:40,380
Sing for me!

2228
03:11:40,380 --> 03:11:49,380
Sing for me!

2229
03:11:49,380 --> 03:12:02,380
Sing my angels!

2230
03:12:02,380 --> 03:12:28,260
I have brought you to this seat of sweet music's throne to this kingdom where all must pay

2231
03:12:28,260 --> 03:12:33,260
pay homage to music.

2232
03:12:33,260 --> 03:12:40,260
Music, you have come here

2233
03:12:40,260 --> 03:12:45,260
for one purpose and one alone.

2234
03:12:45,260 --> 03:12:49,260
Since the moment I first had you sing

2235
03:12:49,260 --> 03:12:55,260
I have needed you with me to serve me to sing

2236
03:12:55,260 --> 03:12:59,260
For my music

2237
03:13:01,260 --> 03:13:05,260
My music

2238
03:13:05,260 --> 03:13:35,020
Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.

2239
03:13:35,020 --> 03:13:38,780
Alright guys, that's it for tonight's broadcast to Orange Launch Radio. You know, I totally

2240
03:13:38,780 --> 03:13:43,940
forgot to get into the DDR Freak Idol thing. You know they're doing a DDR Freak Idol competition

2241
03:13:43,940 --> 03:13:45,020
in random chat right now?

2242
03:13:45,020 --> 03:13:46,020
Oh, lovely.

2243
03:13:46,020 --> 03:13:49,700
And I, I, I'm gonna, I'm gonna volunteer us to get involved somehow. I think it might

2244
03:13:49,700 --> 03:13:50,700
be fun.

2245
03:13:50,700 --> 03:13:51,700
What?

2246
03:13:51,700 --> 03:13:56,260
We'll see. Cause the DDR Freak users, you know, they wanna sing. So, we, why not? We've

2247
03:13:56,260 --> 03:14:01,660
got bandwidth. We'll let them sing on our bandwidth maybe. We'll see. We'll see. We'll

2248
03:14:01,660 --> 03:14:04,500
see. It depends what goes on with that contest.

2249
03:14:04,500 --> 03:14:06,340
I'm frightened.

2250
03:14:06,340 --> 03:14:09,580
Why not? I mean, if we let Loki sing on this station...

2251
03:14:09,580 --> 03:14:10,860
But that was comedy.

2252
03:14:10,860 --> 03:14:14,000
You made me do it, and I didn't want to. Anyways, hey,

2253
03:14:14,000 --> 03:14:17,260
check out that show on Tuesday nights, you know,

2254
03:14:17,260 --> 03:14:19,980
after listening to our wonderful programming.

2255
03:14:19,980 --> 03:14:21,880
It's called Distraction.

2256
03:14:21,880 --> 03:14:23,140
It's awesome.

2257
03:14:23,140 --> 03:14:27,740
They have, um, you know, basically they torture these people on the game show,

2258
03:14:27,740 --> 03:14:29,600
and they let them win cars,

2259
03:14:29,600 --> 03:14:33,380
and then when they get the car, they have to answer more questions or else they destroy the

2260
03:14:33,380 --> 03:14:43,060
the car it was great now this question is for your windshield and the guy got

2261
03:14:43,060 --> 03:14:48,000
it wrong so the losing contestants are there with like shit so the guy had a

2262
03:14:48,000 --> 03:14:52,600
sledgehammer smashed it once of the sledgehammer smashed it again the smash

2263
03:14:52,600 --> 03:14:59,220
of the third time the sledgehammer went through the windshield it was great

2264
03:14:59,220 --> 03:15:03,220
Alright, that's it. We're going to go now because we've got a podcast to tape.
