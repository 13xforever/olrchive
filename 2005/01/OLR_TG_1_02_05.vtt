00:00.000 --> 00:06.280
And now, the Orange Lounge Radio to Go Edition, your internet radio home for discussion on

00:06.280 --> 00:10.760
rhythm and music gaming and all the news on video games that don't suck.

00:10.760 --> 00:15.360
And now, here are your hosts, Dark Sakura, Skye, and Loki.

00:15.360 --> 00:21.600
Hello, everybody, and welcome to the very first Orange Lounge Radio podcast.

00:21.600 --> 00:26.120
I'm your host, Rob Roberts, along with my other host.

00:26.120 --> 00:29.800
Dark Sakura, the great and terrible.

00:29.800 --> 00:33.600
And then, of course, we have one more host you guys have all come to know and love.

00:33.600 --> 00:34.600
And I'm hungry.

00:34.600 --> 00:36.600
No, I'm looking.

00:36.600 --> 00:43.040
All right, so, Orange Launch Radio, this is going to be the first edition of our podcast.

00:43.040 --> 00:44.360
So what is this all about?

00:44.360 --> 00:48.760
The Orange Launch Radio podcast, the idea behind this is this great new technology that's

00:48.760 --> 00:53.480
out there on the internet that's basically, you can kind of think of it as an audio blog.

00:53.480 --> 00:55.300
But it's something that you can subscribe to.

00:55.300 --> 00:58.560
So if you're hearing this, you've figured out via our website how to subscribe to our

00:58.560 --> 01:03.360
podcast and now what you're going to be able to do is that you stay subscribed to our podcast

01:03.360 --> 01:07.520
and about every week or so you're going to get a brand new episode of Orange Lounge Radio

01:07.520 --> 01:12.560
and this is not just rehashed, re-edited stuff that's on our normal 3 hour live talk program.

01:12.560 --> 01:19.120
This is an all new program that's made specifically for you to take with you in your pocket everywhere

01:19.120 --> 01:20.920
you go.

01:20.920 --> 01:23.000
Just promise to treat us gently.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.800
So in the end you can basically say, hey I win at the internet.

01:26.800 --> 01:27.800
Exactly.

01:27.800 --> 01:32.360
than all your friends, basically. No, but podcasting is an awesome technology. It

01:32.360 --> 01:37.040
really just allows everybody to have a shot at creating all this unique content

01:37.040 --> 01:40.680
out there. So we want to muck it up with our stuff too. So what is

01:40.680 --> 01:43.880
Orange Lounge Radio all about? For those of you guys that may have never heard of

01:43.880 --> 01:47.080
us before, you're hearing about us for the first time due to podcasting.

01:47.080 --> 01:52.840
Basically, we are an internet radio station that broadcasts via www.orangeloungeradio.com.

01:52.840 --> 01:56.560
We've been doing this for a couple of years now, and our radio station, which

01:56.560 --> 02:01.500
originally founded behind the concept of rhythm and music video games.

02:01.500 --> 02:05.600
Most common ones everybody thinks about are Konami's Bamani series.

02:05.600 --> 02:11.140
That's Beatmania, Bamani, that was the first game in Konami's series of beat matching games.

02:11.140 --> 02:15.340
There was Beatmania, then we had Dance Dance Revolution, that's the one you guys have all

02:15.340 --> 02:17.220
heard about, certainly.

02:17.220 --> 02:22.380
And then we have other games that came out in that series, Guitar Freaks, Drummania,

02:22.380 --> 02:25.140
Para Para Paradise, all these types of games, right?

02:25.140 --> 02:28.620
And then in the meantime, other folks notice what Konami's doing, and they come out with

02:28.620 --> 02:30.620
their own music games that are pretty good.

02:30.620 --> 02:36.300
You've got Amplitude, you've got Frequency, and then you've got Donkey Konga, Taiko Drum

02:36.300 --> 02:37.300
Master now.

02:37.300 --> 02:41.780
And then of course you had the granddaddies of them all, the very first games we saw like

02:41.780 --> 02:44.620
this, one of your favorites.

02:44.620 --> 02:45.620
Right Jamie?

02:45.620 --> 02:46.940
Yeah, my Bust a Move.

02:46.940 --> 02:47.940
Bust a Move.

02:47.940 --> 02:52.780
Now, you get annoyed when people call this Bust a Groove though, right?

02:52.780 --> 02:58.900
because best move the only reason why it's best to groove over here is because

02:58.900 --> 03:03.220
Taito has best to move licensed for puzzle bobble which puzzle bobble is a

03:03.220 --> 03:06.780
lot cuter name for the little bubble game because it was bubble bobble and

03:06.780 --> 03:12.280
yet puzzle bobble best to move I'm sorry how do you bust a groove what do you do

03:12.280 --> 03:15.860
just like fill it with something and then hit it with a jackhammer I don't

03:15.860 --> 03:20.780
know how can you serve someone I mean it's just in the same same category

03:20.780 --> 03:23.780
Corey right there doesn't make any sense. Whatever.

03:23.780 --> 03:28.300
Alright so of course we have this love for music video games because it's how

03:28.300 --> 03:32.420
we all kinda came together because you'll notice if you visit huge websites

03:32.420 --> 03:35.860
dedicated to these games out there things such as ddrfreak.com

03:35.860 --> 03:40.100
things such as BamaniStyle, DDR spot and of course OrangeLawnsRadio.com you

03:40.100 --> 03:42.180
notice there's quite a little following to these games

03:42.180 --> 03:46.100
however OrangeLawnsRadio we kinda want to expand we notice that

03:46.100 --> 03:49.780
video gaming while it's addressed out there in the internet radio world

03:49.780 --> 03:54.260
it's just not covered quite the way we think we can do it so we like to call

03:54.260 --> 03:54.900
ourselves

03:54.900 --> 03:59.660
also video game news about games that don't suck.

03:59.660 --> 04:03.020
Which sometimes get fewer and fewer.

04:03.020 --> 04:05.940
You'd be surprised. So there's just so many great new games out there we want

04:05.940 --> 04:06.820
to talk about as well

04:06.820 --> 04:10.460
and you know what, even when a game sometimes does suck, we gotta let you

04:10.460 --> 04:11.820
know about it so you don't buy it.

04:11.820 --> 04:15.300
Like Driver 3.

04:15.300 --> 04:19.500
Alright so getting into it, what we want to do here in this episode, let's talk about

04:19.500 --> 04:22.580
about what's going on this week because we want this to be a weekly thing so we're

04:22.580 --> 04:25.820
always going to give you kind of the top stories what's going on. So let's talk

04:25.820 --> 04:28.500
about what's going on in the music gaming world this week. What I want to

04:28.500 --> 04:32.700
talk about is a story that was on ddrfreak.com actually just recently

04:32.700 --> 04:36.700
posted this week and what they're talking about is that Konami is going to

04:36.700 --> 04:42.060
showcase over at the Consumer Electronics Show 2005 and Konami is going

04:42.060 --> 04:45.500
to actually feature Dance Dance Revolution at the show from January 6th

04:45.500 --> 04:49.180
through the 9th and they're going to be doing this thing called the cardio play

04:49.180 --> 04:52.900
zone so now of course the Consumer Electronics Show this is something that takes place in

04:52.900 --> 04:57.760
America they're probably going to be selling games such as you know well I mean not literally

04:57.760 --> 05:02.080
selling there at the show but they're going to be pushing games such as DDR Ultra Mix

05:02.080 --> 05:07.300
2, DDR Extreme, things that came out this year but what a really good time to be pushing

05:07.300 --> 05:09.940
this get fit envelope right at the beginning of the year huh?

05:09.940 --> 05:15.260
Because everyone's going to be making their new year's resolutions and of course everyone's

05:15.260 --> 05:18.720
going to get in a big frenzy to buy it right there at the beginning of the year so even

05:18.720 --> 05:23.000
And if they lose their momentum later on, they've already made the purchase.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Exactly.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.580
And now you are somebody that actually goes to a gym on a regular basis.

05:27.580 --> 05:31.760
You play DDR for a workout sometimes, but you get your real workout at the gym, right?

05:31.760 --> 05:35.360
Tell me about what happens in January versus what happens in June.

05:35.360 --> 05:41.520
The gym fills up with so many stupid people, like, we're going to work out five million

05:41.520 --> 05:45.000
days a week, and we're going to get fit, and then, of course, a month later, it's back

05:45.000 --> 05:46.400
to business as usual.

05:46.400 --> 05:51.680
Maybe a couple of them will stay, but you know, that's why for anyone, I say if anyone's

05:51.680 --> 05:56.360
ever going to make that resolution to get fit, start light because you will burn yourself

05:56.360 --> 05:59.800
out, like just about all those other people do at the gym.

05:59.800 --> 06:00.800
Absolutely.

06:00.800 --> 06:04.000
And if you're going to play DDR to get fit, you know, we've talked a lot about on our

06:04.000 --> 06:09.520
three hour program, we've talked a lot about how, you know, folks use DDR in their diet

06:09.520 --> 06:10.680
and things like that.

06:10.680 --> 06:13.200
Just remember to stick with it, okay?

06:13.200 --> 06:16.920
If you're going to play, play on a regular basis and stick with it because I'm speaking

06:16.920 --> 06:18.280
from experience here.

06:18.280 --> 06:20.800
If you stop playing for a while, you lose it.

06:20.800 --> 06:24.640
It's not just the skill you lose, but you lose your stamina and it sucks.

06:24.640 --> 06:26.960
Oh yeah, I can attest to that.

06:26.960 --> 06:33.240
See right now I'm working on the first stage of our coverage of the aerobic aspects of

06:33.240 --> 06:34.240
DDR.

06:34.240 --> 06:36.600
I'm working on the fattening up stage, okay?

06:36.600 --> 06:38.640
And then we'll get into the actual gameplay.

06:38.640 --> 06:42.760
I can't say when but at some point we'll start playing again

06:42.760 --> 06:46.760
or at least I'll start playing again and become sexy again

06:46.760 --> 06:49.880
but right now it's just like quasi-sexy

06:49.880 --> 06:54.440
so I can't win.

06:54.440 --> 06:59.060
Also what I want to talk about is going on in Bomani News right now this has to do

06:59.060 --> 07:01.120
with DDR UltraMix 2

07:01.120 --> 07:04.840
awesome mix that's out there for the Xbox. They

07:04.840 --> 07:08.400
partnered up with a different drum.com the label there and

07:08.400 --> 07:12.020
just gave a whole new style of music to it. Well,

07:12.020 --> 07:15.580
through the DDR Freak forums, we actually know some of the new songs that are going to be

07:15.580 --> 07:17.580
in downloadable Song Pack 8.

07:17.580 --> 07:21.820
So you guys can look forward to these songs. We have Cosmic Cowgirl is going to be in

07:21.820 --> 07:24.820
Song Pack 8. That was the song that was in Guitar Freak. Do you remember that song?

07:24.820 --> 07:28.300
I love that song.

07:28.300 --> 07:33.200
Exactly. That was my Drummania song. Cosmic Cowgirl. We have a remix of Kind Lady. We

07:33.200 --> 07:36.480
don't know exactly what the remix title is yet, but there will be a remix of Kind

07:36.480 --> 07:37.100
Lady in the

07:37.100 --> 07:41.620
in the song pack. Another remix of In My Eyes was going to be happening as well

07:41.620 --> 07:44.620
and the Togo project featuring Sana

07:44.620 --> 07:48.860
More Deep version 2.1. This song you might remember was a hidden song in the

07:48.860 --> 07:51.700
Max 2 USA so now it's going to cross over to the Xbox

07:51.700 --> 07:54.940
and this is a really interesting one I thought.

07:54.940 --> 07:59.580
If I can even pronounce this right, it's a song from Guitar Freak 6

07:59.580 --> 08:02.740
and Drummania 5 and it's crossing over into DDR. It's

08:02.740 --> 08:08.260
Balalakia, Carried with the Wind. You know this one? It's kinda, it's kinda

08:08.260 --> 08:11.740
an interesting one. Alright. If you wanna hear those songs in their entirety, we'll

08:11.740 --> 08:14.420
be playing them on Orange Launch Radio at some point,

08:14.420 --> 08:19.700
a little bit of a later date. Alright. Now as you know, on Orange Launch Radio, the

08:19.700 --> 08:22.980
program which we have Sunday night, 6.30 Pacific Standard Time, we have this little

08:22.980 --> 08:25.460
segment we like to do called the FUs of the Week.

08:25.460 --> 08:29.220
Well, what we've decided to do for this portable version is,

08:29.220 --> 08:34.840
You know, Jamie still has a little bit of anger, maybe a little bit, but she's going

08:34.840 --> 08:38.740
to use that anger for the forces of good.

08:38.740 --> 08:45.020
And she's going to have her own, so now she's going to have her advice column.

08:45.020 --> 08:48.880
So Jamie, if you would, please tell us your advice column for this week.

08:48.880 --> 08:57.260
My first piece of advice for this first podcast is if you have to sign a contract, read the

08:57.260 --> 09:02.620
damn thing first don't just sign your name to it and then call customer

09:02.620 --> 09:05.500
service when you don't understand what you've just signed when they bill you

09:05.500 --> 09:09.300
for something and when something goes wrong because you were a big retard and

09:09.300 --> 09:14.500
didn't read it always read before you sign I don't care how many damn pages is

09:14.500 --> 09:20.100
or if it's in Swahili if it's a contract they have to pay for you to read it you

09:20.100 --> 09:24.820
can get a lawyer just read it first understand what you are signing your

09:24.820 --> 09:28.660
name too cuz the contract is binding and legal unless you're under the age of

09:28.660 --> 09:31.300
majority within your state and then that's another story correct me if I'm

09:31.300 --> 09:35.780
wrong though but if everybody actually read their contracts wouldn't customer

09:35.780 --> 09:39.460
service employees be without a job no because people are still fundamentally

09:39.460 --> 09:44.820
retarded okay just checking and really now why would you be signing the

09:44.820 --> 09:50.580
contract in Swahili I mean that's just retarded what if you're from Africa but

09:50.580 --> 09:57.580
it

09:58.260 --> 09:59.540
alright alright

09:59.540 --> 10:03.060
uh... low key tell us what's going on in the sim seen this week for those guys

10:03.060 --> 10:07.020
that like to emulate their favorite music games on the computer or i'm sorry

10:07.020 --> 10:10.120
emilate versus simulate i'll get yelled at by somebody for that

10:10.120 --> 10:11.740
simile

10:11.740 --> 10:17.140
well really the one big thing because a lot of websites are down because of uh...

10:17.140 --> 10:18.840
different reasons that anyways

10:18.840 --> 10:27.340
The big thing that come out this week would be Technofeend 3, which is the brand new StepMania skin, for those who might not know.

10:27.340 --> 10:37.340
It was just released, actually, on Bmifestyle.com. You can find it in their downloadable sim file section.

10:37.340 --> 10:43.340
It should be, uh, just search for Technofeend Volume 3, or 3.0, and you'll find it there.

10:43.340 --> 10:46.900
there they've included this time around a brand new completely reworked

10:46.900 --> 10:52.100
interface it's just so well done it's very professional they even have a note

10:52.100 --> 10:57.540
skin to go with it that's pretty sexy but definitely I highly recommend you

10:57.540 --> 11:05.960
download it you will need however step mania 3.9 release candidate to release

11:05.960 --> 11:11.220
can to a I think it's the one it's on step mania.com you can download it there

11:11.220 --> 11:16.980
just get the new upgrade download that skin and it's heaven right there that's

11:16.980 --> 11:22.980
all you need to know and again since this is the first podcast there might be

11:22.980 --> 11:26.100
people listening to this have no idea what you just said which is possible

11:26.100 --> 11:30.240
again sometimes folks have taken the concept of DDR and built these

11:30.240 --> 11:35.180
simulators around it and Loki he's our man in the scene he knows about what's

11:35.180 --> 11:38.860
going on so he's always going to bring you those kinds of updates again step

11:38.860 --> 11:42.540
Step Mania is the most popular Dance Dance Revolution simulator, it's available over

11:42.540 --> 11:45.620
at www.stepmania.com.

11:45.620 --> 11:49.700
But simulators being built for games other than DDR, right?

11:49.700 --> 11:54.380
There's other types of simulators out there, any popular recommendations?

11:54.380 --> 11:58.080
There's some for Guitar Freaks, that's DTX Mania.

11:58.080 --> 12:04.260
Now remember that Step Mania is trying to be an all-in-one simulator someday.

12:04.260 --> 12:12.120
still working on StepMania 4.0, which is supposed to include game types for BeatMania, BeatMania

12:12.120 --> 12:20.280
2DX, Guitar Freaks, DrumMania, Dance Maniacs, Para Para Para, then even some of the ones

12:20.280 --> 12:29.320
that aren't even in the Bomani series, like, what was it, I can't remember, Techno something

12:29.320 --> 12:32.680
or other it's it's some eight panel nine panel thing that there's like a motion

12:32.680 --> 12:35.960
second emotion there's like what three of those in the entire world or

12:35.960 --> 12:39.400
something I don't know like two of them are in Las Vegas yeah two of them are in

12:39.400 --> 12:45.800
Vegas I mean whatever so there's those they're coming tons of you know games

12:45.800 --> 12:49.400
that no one really plays anymore but you know they're gonna be coming to

12:49.400 --> 12:53.640
simulator stuff right now though if you want to play right now DTX mania which

12:53.640 --> 12:57.480
would be one for drum mania you can find tons of information on all these other

12:57.480 --> 13:02.140
simulator stuff on the Bhumani-style forms. They actually have whole sections dedicated

13:02.140 --> 13:05.980
to these simulators. I don't really play much Guitar Freaks because I don't have any good

13:05.980 --> 13:10.900
controllers for them or anything like that. As far as Beatmania goes, Delight Delight

13:10.900 --> 13:17.940
Reduplication, and there's Bhumani, or Bemania DX is the other good one. So check those out,

13:17.940 --> 13:23.340
or BM98, that's another good one to find out. And that's pretty much all that's simulated

13:23.340 --> 13:28.780
out there. I know there's also Feeling Pomo, which is the popping music one, which is supposed

13:28.780 --> 13:33.940
to be pretty good. But, like I said, StepMania 4.0 is supposed to have them all together

13:33.940 --> 13:37.500
and it would be a lot easier than having six different programs. So, look for that.

13:37.500 --> 13:43.300
Alright, we'll see what happens there. Alright, let's move on to what's going on in the rest

13:43.300 --> 13:47.000
of the gaming world. Now, the gaming world is kind of quiet right now because it's the

13:47.000 --> 13:50.700
holidays. We're just coming, you know, it's the first week of 2005, so we're just coming

13:50.700 --> 13:56.220
off the holidays so there's not a whole lot kind of new going on exciting and

13:56.220 --> 13:59.340
I'm sure we're going to start as the new year comes back we're going to start

13:59.340 --> 14:02.460
hearing a whole lot of stuff right up until e3 because they're going to start

14:02.460 --> 14:04.900
dropping little hints here and there so we'll do our best to keep you guys on

14:04.900 --> 14:09.380
top of that but in the meantime there are sometimes news that you can't

14:09.380 --> 14:14.340
control and that is the news one of the oldest American ways of business the

14:14.340 --> 14:17.980
lawsuit but this was kind of amusing if you think about it you guys remember

14:17.980 --> 14:21.120
Remember this game that came out this year called The Guy Game?

14:21.120 --> 14:25.480
And it was basically Girls Gone Wild in game form.

14:25.480 --> 14:28.240
You must love this concept, Loki.

14:28.240 --> 14:31.640
This has actually been done by Howard Stern and The Man Show.

14:31.640 --> 14:33.320
I know it's been done before.

14:33.320 --> 14:37.880
They basically kind of ripped it off and tried to come up with it.

14:37.880 --> 14:42.560
It's almost like you don't know Jack with naked chicks.

14:42.560 --> 14:52.680
It would be a good idea, but unfortunately there was one little thing these guys forgot

14:52.680 --> 14:58.000
to check, and now what's happened is that Cox News Service last week reported that a

14:58.000 --> 15:02.160
young woman, and they're not giving out her name, they're calling her Jane Doe.

15:02.160 --> 15:07.180
She has filed suit against Take-Two, Sony, and Microsoft, because this game was out on

15:07.180 --> 15:09.180
PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

15:09.180 --> 15:10.760
Take-Two are the folks that made the game there.

15:10.760 --> 15:16.380
have filed suit because it has footage of her topless and this was taken during

15:16.380 --> 15:21.180
the annual spring break on Texas South Padre Island well okay that's where they

15:21.180 --> 15:26.180
get a lot of these girls to show their assets so to speak is that these events

15:26.180 --> 15:30.980
by getting them inebriated but there was one little teeny problem the girl was

15:30.980 --> 15:40.780
only 17 oops dough no Jane Jane Doe oopsie Jamie what he as as a girl a gamer

15:40.780 --> 15:45.820
girl what do you think of this first of all I think that showing your boobs for

15:45.820 --> 15:49.740
anybody is about the most retarded thing you can do well being from the south

15:49.740 --> 15:53.820
from where Mardi Gras originated I think that all those stupid tourists that go

15:53.820 --> 15:59.020
to New Orleans to flash their tits for you know boom pies are retarded and so

15:59.020 --> 16:04.400
are all the ones who do the Girls Gone Wild thing. They're sluts. They're easy. They obviously

16:04.400 --> 16:08.500
have a poor self-image because they feel the need to show their boobies to make themselves

16:08.500 --> 16:09.500
be appreciated.

16:09.500 --> 16:12.180
and we appreciate them now

16:12.180 --> 16:16.840
I know it's great though is I love they have like other lawsuits similar to

16:16.840 --> 16:19.960
this type of thing that's not necessarily video game related but

16:19.960 --> 16:25.960
if like do like I know that they were filming for this video at this party

16:25.960 --> 16:29.560
oh you didn't know by going to the girls gone wild party

16:29.560 --> 16:33.640
that they're gonna be filling for the video

16:33.640 --> 16:37.200
what you think is going on there seriously it's retarded

16:37.200 --> 16:41.280
I mean it was spring break okay so they're flat she's flashing your tits

16:41.280 --> 16:41.920
out there

16:41.920 --> 16:45.400
oh my god guess what they recorded it og

16:45.400 --> 16:48.920
well she must be really concerned about that when she went out in front of like

16:48.920 --> 16:50.040
thousands of people

16:50.040 --> 16:54.000
flasher tits you know what I think your parents should pay for this station

16:54.000 --> 16:58.440
you know maker parents pay for this can think this guess what she was a

16:58.440 --> 17:02.560
I don't know I'm sure there's laws against that though I know there's laws

17:02.560 --> 17:04.020
against that her parents should pay

17:04.020 --> 17:11.020
Goddamnit, ruining our entertainment. Always these stupid little hang-ups.

17:11.020 --> 17:13.020
Jamie, any response to this?

17:13.020 --> 17:19.020
Uh, I actually agree with that. Stupid, she knew where she was going.

17:19.020 --> 17:22.020
She probably did it just to make the lawsuit.

17:22.020 --> 17:29.020
Who knows, but would you ever let a guy that you were dating, what would you think if they were, of course you, you know,

17:29.020 --> 17:32.020
folks that listen to Orange on this Radio know that you've been in a long-term relationship for some time,

17:32.020 --> 17:34.660
time. Would you let the boyfriend play the guy game?

17:34.660 --> 17:41.300
Why not? I think they're fucking hilarious. I told Dan to buy BMX XXX just because I wanted

17:41.300 --> 17:44.500
to see what all the crap was in it. No, I did buy that game and that game is

17:44.500 --> 17:49.920
quite nice. But here's my thing, okay? With everything that has to do with putting people

17:49.920 --> 17:55.220
on film and everything, there's a little thing called a release agreement. Where was that

17:55.220 --> 18:01.060
in this, okay? What, they just filmed it and didn't sign a release? Shame on take two.

18:01.060 --> 18:04.540
I'm sure she signed a release but the problem is you can't if you're under 18

18:04.540 --> 18:07.260
you can't sign the contract so she probably said she was 18

18:07.260 --> 18:11.740
they just didn't check her ID but of course if all you're wearing is panties

18:11.740 --> 18:14.460
and nothing else then you probably don't have your ID on you

18:14.460 --> 18:17.780
there still is a thing even if there was a

18:17.780 --> 18:23.180
contract having taken business law a contract against a minor is not a

18:23.180 --> 18:25.980
binding contract it is avoided contract

18:25.980 --> 18:29.100
and so legally yes she does have the right to sue

18:29.100 --> 18:34.460
But, damn girl, just keep your clothes on.

18:34.460 --> 18:37.540
Don't be a slut, it's that easy.

18:37.540 --> 18:42.300
All I gotta say is, we have the game already and so ha, nothing you can do from me seeing

18:42.300 --> 18:43.300
your boobies.

18:43.300 --> 18:45.340
I will see them!

18:45.340 --> 18:47.860
And I will laugh at my victory.

18:47.860 --> 18:49.220
You're a sick man, Loki.

18:49.220 --> 18:53.820
Honestly though, the interesting news that comes out of this in the end, this is going

18:53.820 --> 18:55.100
to be a collector's game.

18:55.100 --> 19:00.860
This will be that original version of Tetris that was on the Nintendo.

19:00.860 --> 19:02.620
This would be your first release of Custer's Revenge.

19:02.620 --> 19:04.320
This will be Custer's Revenge.

19:04.320 --> 19:05.860
This will be that game.

19:05.860 --> 19:06.860
This would be X-Man.

19:06.860 --> 19:14.020
Yes, you know the game I'm talking about, where it looks like Scissors in a Maze except

19:14.020 --> 19:18.020
one of those is really his cock.

19:18.020 --> 19:22.440
On that note, that's going to do it for this edition, our very first edition of the Orange

19:22.440 --> 19:42.880
Thank you guys for downloading us, and we'll see you next time.
