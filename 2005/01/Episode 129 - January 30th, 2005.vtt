You're tuned in to the B-Money Scene's most repaired radio station of all things, B-Money.

05:45.580 --> 05:48.620
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

05:48.620 --> 05:54.620
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts, in this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm,

05:54.620 --> 05:58.620
Miss Jamie Summers, AKA, DarkSakura.

05:58.620 --> 06:02.620
I hate my nose. I hate allergies.

06:02.620 --> 06:05.120
Oh, are you allergic to me?

06:05.120 --> 06:06.620
I've been like this all day.

06:06.620 --> 06:08.620
Oh, I'm sorry. What is it that you're allergic to?

06:08.620 --> 06:09.620
Everything.

06:09.620 --> 06:13.620
Oh, I'm sorry. It's not gay people, is it?

06:13.620 --> 06:15.620
Yes, Rob, it's gay people. I'm sorry.

06:15.620 --> 06:21.620
Also joining us, say hello to Tech Massa, Loki!

06:21.620 --> 06:23.620
I found my knife.

06:23.620 --> 06:26.620
Please, don't run around the house with it.

06:26.620 --> 06:30.620
Promise me you will not chase DDR Angel around with your knife again this week.

06:30.620 --> 06:35.620
Okay, I'll have to see about that, but sure.

06:35.620 --> 06:39.620
Speaking of DDR Angels, say hello to our special guest.

06:39.620 --> 06:41.620
Hello.

06:41.620 --> 06:43.620
You're always here.

06:43.620 --> 06:47.620
Yeah, now what are you going to call me? Uh-oh.

06:47.620 --> 06:51.620
I'm going to call you Al. I don't know, I just was thinking of the old...

06:51.620 --> 06:55.620
forget it. Anyway, um, that's it.

06:55.620 --> 06:59.620
Angel's the only special guest here tonight. She's not really that special anymore either, because she's

06:59.620 --> 07:03.620
always here, so she's just, she's just, you know, your standard guest. She's more of a standard guest

07:03.620 --> 07:07.620
than a special guest. I'm just your pest.

07:07.620 --> 07:11.620
No, no, no, you wouldn't be a pest, because then when I sprayed

07:11.620 --> 07:14.620
the raid on you, it would have gotten rid of you.

07:14.620 --> 07:15.620
Raid?

07:15.620 --> 07:16.620
Ah!

07:16.620 --> 07:17.620
I'm just kidding.

07:17.620 --> 07:18.620
Alright.

07:18.620 --> 07:23.140
Um, but it's just us, you know, feeling the love here in the Orange Launch Radio Studio,

07:23.140 --> 07:24.780
especially after a chaotic week last week.

07:24.780 --> 07:26.740
I wish I felt the love from my allergy medicine.

07:26.740 --> 07:29.060
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

07:29.060 --> 07:32.300
Well, this should be a lovely night.

07:32.300 --> 07:34.740
Jamie's extra sassy because of her allergies.

07:34.740 --> 07:38.300
Loki's got a knife.

07:38.300 --> 07:39.500
This should be an interesting show.

07:39.500 --> 07:48.400
I'm just trying to turn this into a round cable, but I think I just broke it.

07:48.400 --> 07:51.020
So basically you've got a square cable over there and you're trying to turn it into a

07:51.020 --> 07:52.020
round cable.

07:52.020 --> 07:53.020
It's a ribbon cable.

07:53.020 --> 07:59.420
I thought, at least in theory, that I could split these down here, however they're a little

07:59.420 --> 08:04.180
thinner than I thought, so when I poked this knife through, instead of actually splitting

08:04.180 --> 08:08.740
it, it stripped all the covering on this one wire here.

08:38.740 --> 08:40.740
I don't fucking care.

08:40.740 --> 08:42.740
Tonight is definitely one of those nights.

08:43.740 --> 08:45.740
I want the world to die.

08:45.740 --> 08:53.740
Everything and everything in this world needs to wither and die and stop spreading your goddamn pollen.

08:54.740 --> 08:55.740
Please!

08:55.740 --> 08:58.740
And the person in the chatroom named come as you are.

08:58.740 --> 09:00.740
No script. Bad.

09:00.740 --> 09:02.740
Go ahead and boot their ass.

09:03.740 --> 09:05.740
What the hell?

09:05.740 --> 09:08.740
That calls for insta-ban.

09:35.740 --> 09:42.740
let that die already. No! Alright, we'll be back after this with more Orange Launch Radio,

09:45.180 --> 09:49.740
maybe some Bamani news, some random video game stuff. Jamie wants to take this show

09:49.740 --> 09:54.740
tonight in a really random video game direction, but I don't care, we're going to do it. So

09:54.740 --> 10:01.740
So stay tuned, we'll be back after this with Don't Stop!

10:24.740 --> 10:28.740
But you know our love will always stay the same

10:28.740 --> 10:30.740
Don't ever stop

10:30.740 --> 10:32.740
Don't ever quit

10:32.740 --> 10:34.740
Don't ever take it up

10:34.740 --> 10:36.740
You're my man

10:36.740 --> 10:38.740
Yes, it's our friend

10:38.740 --> 10:40.740
You are my friend

10:40.740 --> 10:44.740
You are the best thing that ever happened to me

10:44.740 --> 10:47.740
No one could ever come between

10:47.740 --> 10:50.740
You and me, baby

10:50.740 --> 10:57.740
Because we are what friends should be

10:57.740 --> 11:05.740
I guess you should go, I'll pick you up, oh sweet baby

11:05.740 --> 11:14.740
As years go by, you'll always have me

11:14.740 --> 11:22.740
Don't ever stop, don't ever quit Don't ever take your love from me

11:22.740 --> 11:29.740
Yes it's my win, you are my friend You are the best thing ever happened to me

11:29.740 --> 11:37.740
Don't ever stop, don't ever quit Don't ever take your love from me

11:37.740 --> 11:44.740
Don't ever stop, don't ever quit, don't ever take your love from me

13:07.740 --> 13:11.740
Is

13:11.740 --> 13:15.740

You

16:30.740 --> 16:51.380
How do I look?

16:51.380 --> 17:11.820
I love that promo because it's the only one we have where I get to hear Jamie click like

17:11.820 --> 17:15.860
a chicken.

17:15.860 --> 17:18.100
I can't do any imitations right now.

17:18.100 --> 17:19.100
Aww.

17:19.100 --> 17:20.100
It says one.

17:20.100 --> 17:21.100

Aaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

Especially when the sequel comes out. They know. They have the right to do it again.

17:35.600 --> 17:37.600
They are making a sequel right, they have to do it again.

17:37.600 --> 17:38.600
I've already been out in Japan.

17:38.600 --> 17:41.560
Yeah, they're working on a sequel.

17:38.100 --> 17:40.600
They did a TV series too.

17:40.600 --> 17:44.600
Really? What was the TV series called?

17:44.600 --> 17:45.100

18:05.600 --> 18:09.600
Another week is upon us here at the Orange Lounge radio headquarters.

18:09.600 --> 18:11.600
Hope you guys had a lovely week.

18:11.600 --> 18:13.600
You know, I'm having one of those nights where

18:13.600 --> 18:15.600
I'm not even supposed to be here today.

18:15.600 --> 18:19.680
here today like I was secretly planning to try and take tonight off but it

18:19.680 --> 18:24.520
didn't happen because I was trying to go to a concert I really really want to go

18:24.520 --> 18:29.280
to concert because I haven't been to a concert in a long time God Jamie's gonna

18:29.280 --> 18:37.480
die are you gonna die Jamie don't die Oh Jamie's give me the grudge look anyway I

18:37.480 --> 18:40.840
was trying to go to a concert tonight I wanted to go see Scissor Sisters tonight

18:40.840 --> 18:42.840
because they're playing in San Francisco and I know a lot of you guys probably

18:42.840 --> 18:45.360
don't even know who this band is although they did play on Saturday Night

18:45.360 --> 18:55.360
I love watching when it became unfunny back in the 90s.

19:15.360 --> 19:20.640
back row like it was row like double y in the second balcony okay it was that far back

19:20.640 --> 19:25.120
and I was like fuck that I'm not gonna get tickets if I have to sit that far back so

19:25.120 --> 19:29.440
I'm gonna wait because usually with concerts this is a trick a lot of people don't know

19:29.440 --> 19:34.440
they'll open up better tickets like a week before or you know sometimes you can get general

19:34.440 --> 19:38.800
admission so we were trying to get floor seats but it never opened up I kept checking every

19:38.800 --> 19:43.720
day and I was not able to get better tickets so therefore I'm here tonight where somewhere

19:43.720 --> 19:45.800
in the city by the bay

19:45.800 --> 19:49.440
scissors sisters taking the stage right now and i'm not there

19:49.440 --> 19:51.320
therefore i'm a little bit better tonight

19:51.320 --> 19:53.080
the sound a little bit better

19:53.080 --> 19:57.360
because i could be somewhere else

19:57.360 --> 19:58.980
we're gonna stop tonight show

19:58.980 --> 20:01.640
as we do every week playing a little bit how was your week how was your day jamie

20:01.640 --> 20:05.440

20:09.720 --> 20:12.100

20:12.100 --> 20:17.420
Fucking game. Also known as Final Fantasy XI.

20:17.420 --> 20:22.180
Yeah. Been going to school. My teacher's an asshole.

20:22.180 --> 20:26.060
More like an elitist snob, but eh.

20:26.060 --> 20:29.900
Just stuff, really.

20:29.900 --> 20:33.900
I went bowling yesterday

20:33.900 --> 20:39.220
with Iguana Girl and Islander. You went bowling? I went bowling. I scored five strikes my second game.

20:39.220 --> 20:40.660
Nice.

20:40.660 --> 20:44.260
Do you do the strike dance? Strike!

20:44.260 --> 20:47.140
Did you do that?

20:47.140 --> 20:49.660
Um, then we went to Mikuni.

20:49.660 --> 20:51.140
Oh my god, Jamie.

20:51.140 --> 20:54.180
We should start an orange lounge bowling league.

20:54.180 --> 20:55.140
Um, no.

20:55.140 --> 20:56.760
No.

20:56.760 --> 20:58.300
Come on!

20:58.300 --> 21:01.660
We could all have orange bowling balls.

21:01.660 --> 21:07.660
Come on. It'd be cute. And we could all have this... Rob. Rob. Rob. Rob.

21:07.660 --> 21:08.160
Rob.

21:08.160 --> 21:08.660
What?

21:08.660 --> 21:09.160
Uhh...

21:09.160 --> 21:09.660
What?

21:09.660 --> 21:11.160
No.

21:12.160 --> 21:13.160
Sorry to interrupt.

21:13.160 --> 21:16.160
Hey, Rob, once I had a really good idea just like that...

21:16.160 --> 21:16.660
Uh-huh.

21:16.660 --> 21:20.660
You know, it was to put a Russian space station around, you know, orbit.

21:20.660 --> 21:21.160
Mm-hmm.

21:21.160 --> 21:22.160
Around Earth.

21:22.160 --> 21:23.660
Yeah, that didn't turn out very well.

21:23.660 --> 21:25.660
Why don't you let me finish your week?

21:25.660 --> 21:28.660
Uhh...

21:28.660 --> 21:30.160
I've been sneezing all day.

21:30.160 --> 21:32.160
Woke up with a cat on my head.

21:33.660 --> 21:34.660
Umm...

21:34.660 --> 21:38.660
I just... I'm done.

21:38.660 --> 21:42.660
It's not very often that Jamie wakes up with pussy in her face.

21:42.660 --> 21:46.660
You know what? That wasn't funny.

21:46.660 --> 21:50.660
I thought it was funny and I didn't even hear the... I was laughing before the joke.

21:50.660 --> 21:54.660
The reaction we got in studio when I said that, just Jamie

21:54.660 --> 21:58.660
she's got this very dead look on her face, like you know kind of like

21:58.660 --> 22:02.660
you know she's got that look on her face right now, she's kind of leaning back, she's staring off

22:02.660 --> 22:06.800
into space staring at the ceiling going you know I don't want to be here type

22:06.800 --> 22:10.820
thing and then when I said that you know and she doesn't often get pussy on her

22:10.820 --> 22:18.640
face she just kind of reaches over and grabs the mic and goes you know what no

22:18.640 --> 22:24.740
my cat didn't poop that's sick sometimes I wish we were a TV show I really do I

22:24.740 --> 22:35.420
I've taken two doses of Advil cold sinus, a dose of Benadryl, and two doses of Tylenol

22:35.420 --> 22:37.780
allergy sinus.

22:37.780 --> 22:45.620
I'm drugged, upset, I ate three lindered chocolate balls on the way here.

22:45.620 --> 22:46.940
Were they salty chocolate balls?

22:46.940 --> 22:50.780
Oh hush, they were dark chocolate.

22:50.780 --> 22:56.840
And then I go look at my friends list to see freakin' sluts on my friends list on my live

22:56.840 --> 22:57.840
journal.

22:57.840 --> 22:58.840
Guys-

22:58.840 --> 23:01.680
I got sluts on my friends list too, but that's just how they-

23:01.680 --> 23:02.680
But I need pictures of sluts!

23:02.680 --> 23:06.680
Oh, I'm like, these are actual people, I just have to accept them, that's the way they are.

23:06.680 --> 23:08.880
I never get sluts on my friends list.

23:08.880 --> 23:11.560
Oh, my life is miserable.

23:11.560 --> 23:14.440
Join a couple gay live journal communities, you can get tons of sluts on your friends

23:14.440 --> 23:15.440
page.

23:15.440 --> 23:19.440
No. I mean...

23:19.440 --> 23:23.440
That is...

23:27.440 --> 23:31.440
Wow. Wow.

23:31.440 --> 23:35.440
Uh, Loki, how was your week? How was your day?

23:35.440 --> 23:39.440
Um, well, my week was okay.

23:39.440 --> 23:43.440
Didn't really do too much.

23:43.440 --> 23:52.440
See, Friday Christopher brought over the parts for his PC, so I built that, and that was fun, until I couldn't figure out why I wasn't booting.

23:52.440 --> 24:04.440
Because, now, the motherboard I bought has actually two different chipsets on it, you know, so you can run the older, um, Athlon processors, and you can run the new 64-bit ones.

24:04.440 --> 24:09.440
The ones beside, you know, above, uh, 3.2 gigahertz or whatever.

24:09.440 --> 24:19.440
So, anyways, I had the processor in the right one, but I had the RAM in the wrong set of slots there, so it wasn't booting up.

24:19.440 --> 24:27.440
Finally figured that out after about six hours, and then loaded that all up. It looks really cool.

24:27.440 --> 24:35.440
Christopher's computer is very purdy. It glows purple and, like, black light, purple and pink. It's very nice.

24:35.440 --> 24:41.980
I think Christopher put it best actually, he said his computer looks like Metroid Prime.

24:41.980 --> 24:46.500
And then, on my computer, which is sitting in the middle of the room right now, I installed

24:46.500 --> 24:51.800
the motherboard in that and cut the rest of the case. So I'm pretty much ready to go with

24:51.800 --> 25:02.220
that. I probably should set it up to install everything. So I was messing around with that.

25:02.220 --> 25:07.220
And then play lots of Final Fantasy. And...

25:07.220 --> 25:16.220
We didn't do too much else other than that. Oh, I've been, well, like, the first night when Christopher brought his computer over at Friday, I stayed up till six in the morning.

25:16.220 --> 25:24.220
And then, last night, I stayed up till six in the morning playing Final Fantasy. So, I'm kinda like my, um...

25:24.220 --> 25:30.220
Whole, like, schedule's messed up right now. It's been staying up way too late.

25:30.220 --> 25:35.020
and you have to work tomorrow huh yeah sucks to be you gonna be great though

25:35.020 --> 25:40.860
because my co-workers quitting so now they're gonna be panicking it's great

25:40.860 --> 25:45.980
because I am in like I'm just an observer and they're panic so be fun

25:45.980 --> 25:52.420
then this week I have to go see the Kings in floor seats I hate the Kings

25:52.420 --> 25:57.900
but I'm taking my mom because whatever I couldn't really do much of these tickets

25:57.900 --> 26:06.660
So, okay, DT says I should invest in a Mac Mini. No, I'm sorry, I already have a toaster.

26:06.660 --> 26:10.020
I don't need a piece of shit computer that's small.

26:10.020 --> 26:14.340
Why do you hate Apple computers so much? I mean, I remember the day I brought home my

26:14.340 --> 26:15.340
iPod, you were like...

26:15.340 --> 26:23.220
Okay, I'll tell you why. Back in the day when I had to do fucking school assignments at

26:23.220 --> 26:27.260
the Mac Lab at our school, okay, I'll tell you what, those things are a piece of shit.

26:27.260 --> 26:32.340
you put the disc in, the whole thing explodes. That is pretty much how reliable Macintosh

26:32.340 --> 26:34.840
computers are. They're computers for idiots!

26:34.840 --> 26:39.880
But I remember in the computer school lab, the Macs, when you turn them on, you'd see

26:39.880 --> 26:42.300
the little picture of the computer, and it had the little happy face.

26:42.300 --> 26:46.760
You don't buy computers because they're cute! You buy them because they work, and they're

26:46.760 --> 26:52.640
functionable! You don't buy fucking cute computers! You shouldn't choose a computer because, oh,

26:52.640 --> 26:56.120
it'll match my curtains! Fuck that!

26:56.120 --> 27:01.240
okay but it'll still get on the internet and the fact that it matches the

27:01.240 --> 27:01.880
curtains

27:01.880 --> 27:05.760
yeah you know an old 386 computer will get on the internet too but you know what I'm not

27:05.760 --> 27:06.800
going to be using that

27:06.800 --> 27:10.920
they're good if you're a graphic artist

27:10.920 --> 27:14.980
aha good graphic and actually you can

27:14.980 --> 27:18.320
link for every Mac you have linked up

27:18.320 --> 27:22.500
it will increase the entire processing power of the entire unit because the

27:22.500 --> 27:23.640
dual processing system

27:23.640 --> 27:26.880
You can actually get more power out of a Mac than you can out of a PC.

27:26.880 --> 27:27.960
You can do that with anything.

27:27.960 --> 27:30.320
And they do the video-editing really easy.

27:30.320 --> 27:31.080
Really easy.

27:31.680 --> 27:32.800
You can do that with anything.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.840
You can film the kitty.

27:34.840 --> 27:36.000
You can film your kitty-cat.

27:36.000 --> 27:36.640
Ooh.

27:36.640 --> 27:38.320
And then really easily put it on your Mac.

27:38.320 --> 27:40.140
And you can make little videos, like,

27:40.140 --> 27:40.720
My kitty.

27:40.720 --> 27:42.820
And, you know, string it all together, and then you put, like,

27:42.820 --> 27:44.100
music in the background.

27:44.100 --> 27:45.940
So cute and so easy on a Mac.

27:46.240 --> 27:47.860
You can do that with Windows, too.

27:47.860 --> 27:49.480
Yeah, but everything crashes in Windows.

27:49.740 --> 27:52.040
No, not everything crashes in Windows.

27:52.040 --> 27:52.620
Everything crashes in Windows.

27:52.620 --> 27:53.460
It's more like a fucking Mac.

27:53.460 --> 27:56.460
Now, don't get... Hey, you know what? Don't get me wrong. I love Windows.

27:56.460 --> 28:00.460
You want to hear about Macs? They're powerful gaming machines. Look at all those fucking games for the Macs.

28:00.460 --> 28:04.460
Oh, wait! No, there isn't! That's right, because they suck!

28:04.460 --> 28:07.460
Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Okay.

28:07.460 --> 28:12.460
I'll tell you what's cool about Macs are the laptops, the little iBooks.

28:12.460 --> 28:16.460
The little apple, when you use it on the back, it glows.

28:16.460 --> 28:21.460
So, let's say you ever have to be in the dark.

28:21.460 --> 28:30.820
the Apple will glow and it gives shut up stop but it's not you have you ever

28:30.820 --> 28:34.580
been to the Apple Store at the mall they actually have here here blinding here at

28:34.580 --> 28:38.420
the local mall yeah they have an Apple Store and I don't know how they light

28:38.420 --> 28:42.860
that thing I think they actually took a little chunk of the Sun and put it inside

28:42.860 --> 28:50.220
the Apple Store because it is so freaking bright in there yeah it's like

28:50.220 --> 28:57.280
you know no no I'm sorry I am I will never ever ever I'm going down the

28:57.280 --> 29:03.520
record stance I will never own anything that's made by Apple nothing I'm not

29:03.520 --> 29:07.760
buying an iPod I'm not buying a computer I will not buy a laptop made by them

29:07.760 --> 29:13.640
nothing of course Apple is a fully in subsidiary of Microsoft you know what

29:13.640 --> 29:22.800
did I say Microsoft I said Apple hey you know what you should hold your tongue

29:22.800 --> 29:34.480
and say Apple it's really funny yeah Apple you know elementary school a while

29:34.480 --> 29:42.320
ago this is coming from someone who said that the chair was not green the chair's

29:42.320 --> 29:44.320
The chair's green. I think the chair's green.

29:44.320 --> 29:45.320
It's mostly black, okay?

29:45.320 --> 29:46.320
It's green!

29:46.320 --> 29:52.320
If you take green, or black, and add a little bit of green to that, okay? That is mainly black.

29:52.320 --> 29:55.320
It's a night green.

29:55.320 --> 29:58.320
You know what? It's black, okay?

29:58.320 --> 30:02.320
I will take a piece of that chair into a paint match store and we will settle this debate.

30:02.320 --> 30:07.320
It's fucking black. Just like my trench coat. My trench coat's blue, but it's fucking black.

30:07.320 --> 30:13.820
It looks black, therefore it's black, okay? I don't care if it has a hint of green in it. It's still black.

30:13.820 --> 30:14.820
Hold on, hold on a minute.

30:15.620 --> 30:16.820
That actually is more green.

30:16.820 --> 30:17.820
Hold on a minute.

30:20.820 --> 30:21.320
Whatever.

30:21.320 --> 30:25.820
Hold on, hold on, I'm working. No wait, I want you to rant a little more here. I'm just, you know, finding some music here.

30:31.820 --> 30:33.820
The chair is green.

30:34.820 --> 30:35.320
Black.

30:35.320 --> 30:36.320
Green.

30:36.320 --> 30:36.820
Black.

30:36.820 --> 30:44.020
green black it's a goddamn chair if Justin Timberlake can be black that

30:44.020 --> 30:53.580
chair can be black okay are you finished yes angel how was your week how was your

30:53.580 --> 30:58.500
day Rob made my tongue numb ah I don't even

30:58.500 --> 31:01.660
want to know how that happened sorry I won't bite so hard next time what are

31:01.660 --> 31:12.380
you talking about? Stupid Altoids. AHHH! And that was your week and your day? No. Um, jeez,

31:12.380 --> 31:18.580
smilefancy11, eh. Um, unfortunately when I was on you guys weren't, because you guys

31:18.580 --> 31:25.700
had to work, so, but then again I had school, so, eh. Not much happened, and I'm supposed

31:25.700 --> 31:30.780
to say hi to Mikey. So, hi Mikey! Otherwise known as BRP Ohio Baloney.

31:30.780 --> 31:38.520
That's quick. My week and my day, uh, really not a whole lot going on. I did play a little

31:38.520 --> 31:41.960
bit of Final Fantasy. I had days off actually this week. I took Monday and Tuesday off of

31:41.960 --> 31:45.840
work and oh my god, I had this big list of things I was gonna do. I was gonna go to the

31:45.840 --> 31:50.000
mall and I was gonna go shopping and I was gonna, like there was all this stuff I wanted

31:50.000 --> 31:53.720
to buy, like new socks and underwear and things. I was gonna buy all this stuff at the mall

31:53.720 --> 31:59.720
And then, let's see, I was gonna go to Ikea one day, and then I was gonna clean my room

31:59.720 --> 32:00.720
from top to bottom.

32:00.720 --> 32:04.600
I had this big project where I was gonna, like, totally redo my room and clean it, and

32:04.600 --> 32:14.080
I didn't get any of that done because I was leveling in Final Fantasy all day both days.

32:14.080 --> 32:20.240
I think I'm just gonna uninstall it, and I won't be tempted to play it anymore.

32:20.240 --> 32:24.240
I'm seriously wondering how much would I get done if Final Fantasy XI wasn't installing it.

32:24.240 --> 32:27.240
You know what though, seriously, if it wasn't that, it would be some other game.

32:27.240 --> 32:30.240
I'd go right back to playing Final Fantasy X, or something.

32:30.240 --> 32:35.240
Look, he says, at least I'd finished the damn game.

32:35.240 --> 32:38.240
Alright, whatever.

32:38.240 --> 32:42.240
And now they're yelling at me, I can't uninstall the game.

32:42.240 --> 32:47.240
Let's see, what else? What else is going on in Rob's World?

32:47.240 --> 32:51.760
yesterday we went out to sushi that was cool we went to wasabi which is cool

32:51.760 --> 32:54.760
because when you actually when you walk in the door they all yell at you from

32:54.760 --> 33:04.680
behind the bar when you walk in and it always scares me it always scares me

33:04.680 --> 33:07.880
when I walk in there it's like you know I walk in doo doo doo doo I'm gonna walk

33:07.880 --> 33:15.360
into a nice little sushi restaurant I don't know it always sounds like wasabi

33:15.360 --> 33:18.200
I always thought they were saying the name of the restaurant.

33:18.200 --> 33:22.080
Oh, cause I know, well, Makuni does it, so like, any time you go into

33:22.080 --> 33:25.660
an establishment, they're supposed to go to Ashima Se, which is like, welcome.

33:25.660 --> 33:30.760
Oh. Very polite one. But see, we'll see the thing about, like, Makuni and other sushi

33:30.760 --> 33:32.680
places, they're very quiet, they're very low-key,

33:32.680 --> 33:36.880
they're very nice little places, but Wasabi's a frickin' sports bar, okay? They play, like,

33:36.880 --> 33:40.880
basketball games on the TV and stuff, and then it just so happens that you have

33:40.880 --> 33:42.360
sushi there. It's a sushi bar.

33:42.360 --> 33:46.360
And I mean bar. Like, emphasis on the bar. It just has sushi. It's pretty good.

33:47.360 --> 33:49.360
But they're loud. It's very loud and noisy.

33:54.360 --> 33:56.360
Uhh, what else?

33:57.360 --> 34:02.360
I have this whole list of things I was going to talk about, but I can't think of any, so I guess we'll just have to move on.

34:03.360 --> 34:06.360
I wish I had some exciting DDR story to tell, but I really don't.

34:06.360 --> 34:09.360
I haven't been to the arcade in a while. I'm still waiting for them to set up 2DX.

34:09.360 --> 34:12.380
2DX. We're supposed to be getting 2DX here locally. That was supposed to happen, what,

34:12.380 --> 34:18.040
four weeks ago? I guess they're waiting on a part, so we'll see. Loki. Loki has a comment.

34:18.040 --> 34:25.800
It'll never happen. They'll just keep talking and hinting at it. The monitor will constantly

34:25.800 --> 34:29.120
be in trend to us. It'll never happen. The machine's been...

34:29.120 --> 34:35.800
I've been taking pictures of it. But there's no monitor. The monitor's gone.

34:35.800 --> 34:45.800
Okay, you know, I don't know, they should like ghetto rig it.

34:45.800 --> 34:49.800
Pimp my 2DX machine.

34:49.800 --> 34:53.800
Hey, what was that idea for a TV show you were talking about earlier this week? I thought it was kind of cool.

34:53.800 --> 34:56.800
Pimp my rig.

34:56.800 --> 34:58.800
And what would happen on this show?

34:58.800 --> 35:04.800
They would take someone's piece of shit computer and they'd make it pretty. And they'd case mod it.

35:04.800 --> 35:25.360
kostjamrh Our show's come to a halt because we're trying to give Jamie chocolate right

35:25.360 --> 35:26.360
now.

35:27.360 --> 35:29.360
Gotta get your priorities in straight.

35:31.360 --> 35:32.360
Chocolate first.

35:33.360 --> 35:36.360
Legend of Zaku says he needs someone to pimp his PA skills.

35:38.360 --> 35:39.360
Practice, practice.

35:39.360 --> 35:40.360
That's what it takes.

35:41.360 --> 35:45.360

35:53.360 --> 35:55.360
L. Mullet made it funny.

35:55.360 --> 35:59.360
He says once they pimp it, they can call it an apple.

36:02.360 --> 36:06.360
Oh, I'm sorry. They're not removing all functionality out of it.

36:06.360 --> 36:09.360
Or replacing the innards with a toaster.

36:10.360 --> 36:14.360
I remember the old G4s, the transparent toasters. Those are great.

36:17.360 --> 36:22.360
Alright, we're gonna go to a break. When we come back from this break, I guess we'll talk about some DDR stuff.

36:22.360 --> 36:26.360
There's some stuff going on in the Bevani scene this week, and I suppose we can talk about it.

36:26.360 --> 36:28.360
Might as well.

36:28.360 --> 36:31.360
In this break, what?

36:31.360 --> 36:37.360
Oh yeah, and Jamie has this really random Castlevania thing she wants to share with you guys, so we'll hook that up for later.

36:37.360 --> 36:44.360
In this break, we're going to play some PlayStation 2DX songs, because I want to hear Cracker.

36:44.360 --> 36:47.840
So we'll be back after this with more orange lounge radio

37:44.360 --> 37:47.360
Taki no mienu tenka ni basen itto nai

38:11.960 --> 38:13.660
Nari o miru nari o mo

39:13.660 --> 39:28.660
Looking for the light of night in the world and I see where there is light gone

39:28.660 --> 39:36.660
Look inside you came on between the world and the sea

39:36.660 --> 39:40.660
Not past my future

39:40.660 --> 39:43.660
Where it goes

39:43.660 --> 39:46.660
Where the birds are going

39:46.660 --> 39:53.660
The sunshine in a black dark forest

39:53.660 --> 39:59.660
Hold your lies, don't you cry, cry, cry

39:59.660 --> 40:05.660
There's a light on my tooth

40:05.660 --> 40:11.660
Hold your lies, don't you smile, smile, smile

40:11.660 --> 40:14.660
Yes, I can't listen

40:14.660 --> 40:16.660
I want you

40:46.660 --> 40:50.660
Let me show you what you can do with your life.

42:16.660 --> 42:20.660
Oh,

42:20.660 --> 42:24.660
oh

42:24.660 --> 42:28.660
oh

42:28.660 --> 42:32.660
oh

42:32.660 --> 42:36.660
oh

42:36.660 --> 42:40.660
oh

42:40.660 --> 42:44.660
oh

44:14.660 --> 44:41.660
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

44:41.660 --> 44:47.900
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and Jamie wants to do something for you guys here.

44:47.900 --> 44:52.380
This is a little bit random, it doesn't really have to do with Momani per se, but turn on

44:52.380 --> 44:53.380
the satanic music.

44:53.380 --> 44:54.380
What do we got there in the background?

44:54.380 --> 44:56.180
It sounds satanic, it's churchy.

44:56.180 --> 44:57.180
Sounds satanic to me.

44:57.180 --> 44:58.820
I'm actually feeling better now that I stand up.

44:58.820 --> 44:59.820
Oh, that's good.

44:59.820 --> 45:03.580
But you know, we've always made fun of Castlevania Symphony the night before the bad voice acting.

45:03.580 --> 45:06.100
Right, and this has to do with the podcast from last week.

45:06.100 --> 45:07.740
This kind of relates into the podcast.

45:07.740 --> 45:10.580
And if you listen to it, you know what we were talking about.

45:10.580 --> 45:17.580
Thank you. That's the plug I was going to make. If you haven't checked out the podcast yet, do it! www.orangeloungeradio.com

45:17.580 --> 45:23.580
Click on Orange Lounge Radio to go. There's a whole extra 20 minute show that we do, and we talk about random shit like this.

45:23.580 --> 45:30.580
Such as the voice acting in Castlevania Symphony of the Night. And a lot of you guys have played this game. God, this song scares the shit out of me.

45:30.580 --> 45:39.580
Um, a lot of you...listen to Orange Lounge Radio. It is holy.

45:39.580 --> 45:40.580
Oh, I didn't know it was going through.

45:40.580 --> 45:45.580
Yeah, it's already going through. They can hear it. The holiest of internet radio. No, anyway.

45:45.580 --> 45:46.580
I'm gonna go ahead and start playing.

45:46.580 --> 45:50.580
Okay. So, you know the bad boys acting in Symphony of the Night is like,

45:50.580 --> 45:55.580
Die, monster. You don't belong in this world. You know, it's really lame.

45:55.580 --> 46:01.040
So anyway, Jamie said she wanted to play for you all how much better the Japanese voice

46:01.040 --> 46:02.460
acting is.

46:02.460 --> 46:04.340
So she's going to do that for you guys.

46:04.340 --> 46:10.460
Now this is the cool thing, if you're listening live on Sunday night, which I know obviously

46:10.460 --> 46:14.980
right now you are, but some of you guys hear this show on the rebroadcast over on DDR Freak

46:14.980 --> 46:19.580
Radio and all that stuff, you can actually see it on our webcam, www.orangetonsradio.com.

46:19.580 --> 46:28.580
I would appreciate however those people sent copies of them, I will put this up on somewhere for people to see the images.

46:28.580 --> 46:34.580
Now Missy is our usual webcam whore and she's not here tonight, so hopefully somebody else is saving pictures.

46:34.580 --> 46:38.580
Save the pictures and after the show I'll give you my email address.

46:38.580 --> 46:52.580
One gay man, one angsty woman, and one angry man. Orange Lounge Radio, coming to a theater near you.

46:52.580 --> 46:57.580
I have a story on here. You know how they give you the whole story? It actually is different, but it's still written in English.

46:57.580 --> 47:00.580
But they say it as your...

47:00.580 --> 47:06.580
Okay. So now you actually have to play the game for a little bit to get to the opening.

47:06.580 --> 47:09.080
You just wanted to play games on Orange Lawn's radio.

47:12.080 --> 47:13.580
Isn't this in a Kiriyamoka track?

47:15.080 --> 47:15.580
I don't know.

47:22.580 --> 47:30.580
Isn't this great? You guys are tuned into an internet radio station, and you're not even watching somebody play games.

47:30.580 --> 47:32.580
Oh, here we go.

48:00.580 --> 48:04.580
If you don't like having fun with your friends,

48:05.580 --> 48:09.580
then help each other out in search of great partner to meet a number of Xi.

48:10.580 --> 48:13.580
If you love it, let's cheer on each other.

48:14.580 --> 48:13.480
Otherwise,...?

48:13.580 --> 48:15.580
What are you thinking of?

48:15.580 --> 48:20.580
Are you comparing small with old entanglements?

48:20.940 --> 48:22.580
Very large.

48:22.580 --> 48:24.080
But you're over it.

48:54.080 --> 48:56.080
That was what?

48:56.080 --> 48:58.080
Hydro storm.

48:58.080 --> 49:24.000
That was very hot.

49:24.000 --> 49:33.000
I know this isn't Symphony of the Night, but I'm used to Symphony of the Night. It has the sexiest music. God, the music is so good.

49:54.000 --> 49:58.880
intervened. Castlevania, the castle of Dracula, which is rumored to appear only once every

49:58.880 --> 50:03.080
century, suddenly and mysteriously materialized. More text.

50:03.080 --> 50:07.240
Meanwhile, powerful forces were at work in the lives of a man named Alucard, the very

50:07.240 --> 50:12.840
same Alucard who had previously teamed up with Ralph C. Belmont to destroy his immortal

50:12.840 --> 50:18.080
father Vlad Tepes, aka Count Dracula. Alucard, in order to rid the world of his own first

50:18.080 --> 50:23.960
bloodline, sealed off his powers and entered into what was supposed to be an eternal slumber.

50:23.960 --> 50:26.960
At the end of this is the line that they pissed off that they changed.

50:26.960 --> 50:32.960
But now that sleep had been disturbed, now a card is aware of the evil that is once again arisen in this homeland.

50:32.960 --> 50:36.960
The time has come once more for the forces of good and evil to engage in their ancient battles.

50:36.960 --> 50:38.960
Jekyll's castle beckons for you.

50:38.960 --> 50:42.960
And perhaps none but that bright and glaring moon can say who will triumph.

50:42.960 --> 50:45.960
They changed that line. That pissed me off. That was so awesome.

50:45.960 --> 50:47.960
This is just like watching Iron Chef.

50:50.960 --> 50:51.960
Are those secret ingredients?

50:51.960 --> 50:53.960
POTATO!

50:53.960 --> 50:55.960
Let me bite this pepper.

50:57.960 --> 51:00.960
And it says, JACULA X. That's so awesome.

51:03.960 --> 51:07.960
This is actually supposed to be on the 32X.

51:09.960 --> 51:10.960
You know?

51:10.960 --> 51:12.960
Alright. Lovely.

51:13.960 --> 51:14.960
You know...

51:14.960 --> 51:16.960
All I gotta say is, uh...

51:21.960 --> 51:24.960
Who's the man that resurrected Dracula?

51:25.960 --> 51:26.960
Shit!

51:28.960 --> 51:29.960
Can you dig it?

51:29.960 --> 51:30.960
Oh yeah.

51:33.960 --> 51:35.960
You're a dumbass.

51:36.960 --> 51:37.960
Alright, alright.

51:38.960 --> 51:39.960
Anyway...

51:39.960 --> 51:54.960
Anyway, gave me just one excuse to play video games during the show. Alright. That was pretty cool though, I'd actually never heard that, the Japanese version. I think maybe you sent me bits and pieces, like on Wave.

51:54.960 --> 51:59.960
I had a file of Alucard though, because I figured we wouldn't be getting to the part with Alucard, so I brought a file with him.

51:59.960 --> 52:02.960
Did you want me to play that Little Wave sample?

52:02.960 --> 52:03.960
In just a sec.

52:03.960 --> 52:26.960
kostjamrh We'll be talking about Bobanis at some point this evening too, but let's face it, you know, there hasn't been a new game lately. Well, actually, there was a big new game this week. We don't really have an excuse to not be talking Bobani. We'll get to it, though. We will, we will.

52:26.960 --> 52:35.960
Of course, Castlevania. I mean, a lot of you guys that play DDR, I know a lot of you guys are into Castlevania, too, and if you're not, you should be, because the music's good, the gameplay's good. Oh, yes, Jamie.

52:35.960 --> 52:36.960
The file of Alucard?

52:36.960 --> 52:38.960
Yes. You want it now?

52:38.960 --> 52:39.960
Yeah.

52:39.960 --> 52:40.960
Here it is.

52:51.960 --> 52:52.960
That's it.

52:52.960 --> 52:55.960
Yeah, but see, isn't the voice acting better?

52:55.960 --> 53:00.460
But see, there's something about the American voice acting that's very charming.

53:00.460 --> 53:03.460
Die, monster! You don't belong in this world!

53:03.460 --> 53:04.460
It's cute!

53:04.460 --> 53:05.960
Excuse me, Richter.

53:05.960 --> 53:07.460
Hahahaha!

53:10.960 --> 53:13.460
Ahhh, boy oh boy.

53:13.960 --> 53:14.960
Alright.

53:15.460 --> 53:18.460
Loki's gonna hook the webcam back up so you can stare at the couch again.

53:18.460 --> 53:19.960
I'm gonna check on my laundry.

53:19.960 --> 53:22.960
Alright, meanwhile, uh, we're gonna talk a little bit about some Bimani news.

53:22.960 --> 53:26.960
There actually was a little bit of news this week, and we can talk about that.

53:26.960 --> 53:30.960
This isn't Bomani. Okay, I'll talk about the Castlevania thing real fast.

53:30.960 --> 53:34.960
But you know that Konami was making this big announcement on Thursday?

53:34.960 --> 53:38.960
They were going to make a big announcement on January 27th, right?

53:38.960 --> 53:42.960
Well, it turned out that the big announcement was just their 2005 lineup.

53:42.960 --> 53:46.960
So, you know, you can see all the new Konami games that are coming out in 2005.

53:46.960 --> 53:50.960
And of course, as suspected, and if you were paying attention to OrangeLawrenceRadio.com throughout the week,

53:50.960 --> 53:54.580
the week you already knew this, but one of the games they announced was Castlevania Curse

53:54.580 --> 53:59.260
of Darkness, which is going to be a brand new PlayStation 2 title. Very cool. And that's

53:59.260 --> 54:03.260
in addition to the DS Castlevania game. So it's going to be a big year for Castlevania.

54:03.260 --> 54:06.540
That's going to be cool. And then they announced some other games. A Ninja Turtles game is

54:06.540 --> 54:13.880
in there. What else was there? There was a new Frogger game. Oh, and of course Metal

54:13.880 --> 54:18.980
Gear Acid for the PSP. We all knew that was coming. So they announced all these games.

54:18.980 --> 54:24.840
And then what was weird is that the same day, the exact same day, in unrelated news, but

54:24.840 --> 54:29.620
they put out a press release on this, they did not announce any new DDR titles.

54:29.620 --> 54:34.980
They did not announce any Xtreme 2, they did not announce UltraMix 3, they didn't announce

54:34.980 --> 54:38.980
DDR with Mario for the US, they didn't announce any of that stuff.

54:38.980 --> 54:44.580
But what they did do is that they published this press release saying, hey, guess what

54:44.580 --> 54:54.980
kids, Dance Dance Revolution sold 1.2 million copies in North America in 2004. Now, that's

54:54.980 --> 55:00.780
across all titles, so we're talking Extreme and Ultramix 2 combined, along with, you know,

55:00.780 --> 55:07.580
Ultramix 1 and Max 2. All those combined, all those sales totaled 1.2 million, but really,

55:07.580 --> 55:12.380
for a game that requires an additional peripheral to play, not too shabby. Certainly higher

55:12.380 --> 55:16.820
sales than any power pad game ever got right so that was 1.2 million copies in

55:16.820 --> 55:23.460
2004 since DDR debuted in 2001 all the way back on Dance Dance Revolution on

55:23.460 --> 55:30.100
the PlayStation 2.5 million copies of DDR games for the home consoles in the

55:30.100 --> 55:37.080
US sold not too shabby right but then they didn't announce a new DDR game to

55:37.080 --> 55:41.500
go along with that they just said gee isn't DDR great but honestly think

55:41.500 --> 55:45.060
Think about it people, are they going to submit this press release and then say,

55:45.060 --> 55:50.000
oh and by the way, because of DDR's great success, no more DDR games in the U.S.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.000
It's done.

55:51.000 --> 55:52.000
We're pulling the plug on DDR.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
We're going out on the top.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
That's right.

55:55.000 --> 55:59.340
We're like, you know, we're like a TV sitcom like Friends or something.

55:59.340 --> 56:02.500
We're going to go out while we're still on top.

56:02.500 --> 56:05.640
I don't think so boys and girls, that's not quite how it works.

56:05.640 --> 56:11.460
You can bet your sweet ass that we will see new games on PlayStation and Xbox this year

56:11.460 --> 56:16.700
And we will probably see that GameCube game as well. I think it's just a foregone conclusion.

56:16.700 --> 56:20.340
We just have to sit here and twiddle our thumbs until the details are announced, which probably

56:20.340 --> 56:27.260
won't be until E3. Honestly. And that's that. Anything you want to add to that, Loki?

56:27.260 --> 56:33.740
What's a GameCube? Smartass.

56:33.740 --> 56:37.940
Jamie, anything you want to add to that?

56:37.940 --> 56:39.940
Now, aren't you excited about new DDR on the console?

56:39.940 --> 56:42.940
I am if I... Yeah, I am.

56:42.940 --> 56:49.940
Now, this is what I'm thinking. How many copies of a video game do you think it would take to sell to call it a success?

56:49.940 --> 56:53.940
A successful... How many copies does a successful video game sell?

56:53.940 --> 56:54.940
Two.

56:54.940 --> 56:57.940
Come on. Like a hundred thousand?

56:57.940 --> 56:58.940
That's decent.

56:58.940 --> 57:00.940
A hundred thousand would be really decent, right?

57:00.940 --> 57:09.940
Now, if one out of every ten people that bought DDR in 2004 were to support a, I don't know,

57:09.940 --> 57:17.420
another music game that Konami would put out, say Beatmania 2DX. If you could convince one

57:17.420 --> 57:21.300
out of every ten people that bought DDR that Beatmania 2DX is a good idea, one out of every

57:21.300 --> 57:24.620
ten, you'd have a successful game on your hands.

57:24.620 --> 57:37.620
If you could say, convince those same one out of ten people to, I don't know, say support an online music game related radio show, we would be rich.

57:40.620 --> 57:43.620
Yeah, I know, I know. Man can dream.

57:43.620 --> 57:53.620
Whereas the figure is actually more like one out of every million actually support that internet, because that would make it what, two? Yeah, that's about how many listeners we have, two.

57:53.620 --> 58:03.860
to. All right. And everyone else is expecting to hear, you know, Tomosuke and the rest of,

58:03.860 --> 58:09.100
you know, the Orange Lounge radio band because they think that this shows... You know, there's

58:09.100 --> 58:12.700
been so many people out there that have actually thought that Orange Lounge radio is related

58:12.700 --> 58:17.020
to Orange Lounge that we finally put a disclaimer on the website at the very, very bottom in

58:17.020 --> 58:22.100
little text. Note, Orange Lounge radio is not affiliated with Orange Lounge the band

58:22.100 --> 58:31.020
from DDR and 2DX and all that. Sorry. Tomosuke does have his own site. It's out there. We

58:31.020 --> 58:36.100
had a link to it once. Just put Orange Lounge into Google and it's the site that comes up

58:36.100 --> 58:43.260
before Orange Lounge Radio? Yes. Before I let my pet peeve bug me anymore, it's Tomosuke.

58:43.260 --> 58:54.140
Sorry. I'm white. Alright. I just, I don't know why. I know a lot of people fear, have

58:54.140 --> 58:59.380
this fear that if they bring out 2DX in America it's gonna be fucked up, but I kinda don't

58:59.380 --> 59:06.160
care. I just really want them to do it. Even if it isn't as good as 2DX's seventh, eighth,

59:06.160 --> 59:10.780
ninth style that's coming out soon, even if it's not that good, give us some new songs.

59:10.780 --> 59:15.580
give us something, something to make it US and I'd be happy. A lot of people would be

59:15.580 --> 59:25.940
very, very happy if you do it. That's my plea. What can you do? Alright. Any other comments

59:25.940 --> 59:32.340
on BeatMania 2DX USA and the hopes and dreams of seeing it happen? We wish, we wish. I know.

59:32.340 --> 59:37.520
Not going to happen, but whatever. See, now Jamie, listen up pessimists. Jamie, you usually

59:37.520 --> 59:43.280
prefer the Japanese mixes to American mixes, usually the games and stuff, but you still

59:43.280 --> 59:45.600
would want to see a 2DX U.S. mix.

59:45.600 --> 59:46.600
Absolutely.

59:46.600 --> 59:47.600
Why?

59:47.600 --> 59:49.280
Just to have it out here.

59:49.280 --> 59:51.320
Another 2DX game to waste my money on, exactly.

59:51.320 --> 59:52.320
Seriously.

59:52.320 --> 59:58.460
I still have to find a copy of Fourth Style somewhere.

59:58.460 --> 01:00:00.720
And I understand what they're saying in the chat room there, they're saying if you were

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:05.220
to bring 2DX to the U.S. it would have to appeal to the U.S. gamers.

01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:09.340
You only have to appeal to one out of every ten people that bought DDR last year to make

01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:15.260
this game a success. That's all I'm saying. One out of every ten should not be that hard.

01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:23.700
If Donkey Konga can be a success, 2DX can be a success. You know it. I know this in

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:28.340
my heart. A lot of 2DX elitists, I'm not saying everybody that plays 2DX is a 2DX elitist,

01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:32.680
but a lot of 2DX elitists out there would have you believe that the masses don't want

01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:38.760
to eat up a game like 2DX. But whenever I play 2DX in the arcades, there's always these

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:43.840
people that stand around kind of watching going, ooh, ah, just like with DDR. It's got

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:52.500
a lot of that same appeal to it. I don't know. We'll see. We're going to take a break. We'll

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:56.800
be back. And I guess we'll open up the Skype line. I'm sure some of you guys out there

01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:00.400
want to make a comment on this, I'm sure. So if you want to know what the Skype line

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:05.720
is all about, go to www.orangelaundraider.com and click on interact with us and it has all

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:11.320
the information you need there in order to interact with the program via the Skype line.

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:17.240
Meanwhile we're going to play some music and in this break I want to do some Para Para

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:23.080
music so we're going to do that and we're going to start it off with some Ali Japan.

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:30.080
Sounds Like Fun, and we'll be back after this.

01:01:53.080 --> 01:02:05.080
This is meant to be together, a wish upon a dream forever

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:15.080
Now our heroes will play the game, and we will see you in front of us

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:18.080
Are you ready for this fight tonight?

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:26.080
Who is that who's trying to see you will play me your part?

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:30.080
I need your plan

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:31.080
We're gonna sing for you

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:33.080
O-re-o-re

01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:36.080
I need your plan

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:38.080
Come be the jersey, yo

01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:39.080
O-re-o-re

01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:43.080
I need your plan

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:44.580
We're gonna sing for you

01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:49.080
O-le-o-le, A-le-ja-la-n

01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:51.080
You'll be the champion

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:55.580
O-le-o-le, A-le-ja-la-n

01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:32.580
A bad body to the music sound down A bad body to the music sound through

01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:35.580
A bad body to the music sound through

01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:38.580
I'm still alive, I've got fucking soul to cast down

01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:40.580
I'm still alive

01:03:40.580 --> 01:04:04.580
Come on baby, come on boy Won't you really be the only one in Tokyo?

01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:37.580
A bad fight is the future coming

01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:38.580
You're all mine

01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:40.580
A bad fun, 2000, calm down

01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:42.580
Come down, let's do it

01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:17.580
He's gonna listen to my word

01:07:40.580 --> 01:08:01.940
Whoops, forgot to queue up a promo there that says we're coming back, my bad.

01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:03.940
Let me, uh, put something up there.

01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:19.940
Hi-ho! Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:25.940
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:28.940
There we go! Now we can come back.

01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:29.940
Hello boys and girls.

01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:37.940
You know the DDR Freak was down earlier this evening, but it's back up now. I guess they were having some server problems.

01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:42.940
DDR Freak was down and then didn't you try to get on Bamani style and they were down too? Everybody's broken!

01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:44.940
They all broke!

01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:47.940
What can you do?

01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:49.940
But now the DDR Freak is...

01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:56.940
Now the DDR Freak is back up, I went over to the Mod of the Month thread and I voted for Jamie.

01:08:56.940 --> 01:08:57.940
I voted for you for Mod of the Month.

01:08:57.940 --> 01:09:01.540
of the month. Thank you. I'm not gonna win. I know you're not, because a bunch of people

01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:04.500
went in there and flooded for somebody else. But that's okay, you should still vote for

01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:15.340
Jamie. Do it! Do it! Alright. Anyway, I was asked to pass along, our buddy explicit, who's

01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:19.660
usually here at the show, you know, he has a lot of FUs, he sent along a little private

01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:23.720
message to me over on Orange Lounge Radio, and he wanted me to share some stuff with

01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:29.960
you guys about the upcoming tournament that's happening on what Saturday this

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:33.680
Saturday Saturday February 5th piss is happening this Saturday so excited

01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:40.360
Paradise Island Smacktown sack down or smack sack Smacktown sack down if I have

01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:46.680
a lot to drink tonight piss might happen even earlier the Paradise Island

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:52.280
sacktown Smackdown is happening this Saturday February 5th and they're gonna

01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:58.280
They're going to have the P.A. pneumonia, like pan pneumonia. Get it? P.A. and pneumonia. Pan pneumonia.

01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:00.280
That's their version of perfect attack.

01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:04.280
And they're going to have a showstopper freestyle contest. That should be fun.

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:09.280
And, get your ice rockets ready, an initial D grand prix.

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:12.280
Joy and joy. That should be fun.

01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:13.280
Golden shower sprawl.

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:14.280
Shut up.

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:23.640
explicit asked me to pass along some updates to the tournament they've

01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:27.480
actually lowered some of the prices which is nice so if you were thinking

01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:33.000
about it they've actually lowered the price to get into freestyle and try to

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:40.400
pull up the latest update and let's see freestyle price has been reduced to $10

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:43.420
There's only eight if you're pre-registered.

01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:47.540
So if you want to pre-register, go to DDR Freak, now that it's back up.

01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:51.860
Go to DDR Tournament Chat, or whatever that forum's called, and look for the Paradise

01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:52.860
Island thread.

01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:55.520
And yes, I know that's a local tournament, so those of you guys on the East Coast probably

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:59.760
are not feasibly going to be going to this, but I did promise we would put that little

01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:01.720
local plug.

01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:06.680
And at some point during the tournament, I do plan on making a cameo.

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:09.040
I'm going to dabble in the piss for a little bit.

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:11.220
Are you going to get your hands wet?

01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:14.620
I'm going to go get my hands wet at piss.

01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:15.620
Okay we'll stop.

01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:16.620
Seriously.

01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:22.100
Oh, damn.

01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:23.100
Looking forward to piss.

01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:24.740
It'll be fun.

01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:28.460
But don't call it that in front of him because he'll get really mad.

01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:32.340
He was a really good sport here at the show the other week.

01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:34.940
We'll get you the full piss rundown next Sunday on the show.

01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:36.180
Hey, he should have not mentioned it.

01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:37.180
We would have never thought about it.

01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:41.180
I would have never thought, and I'm kind of stupid.

01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:43.180
It's all his fault. He can only go to himself.

01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:46.180
I know, I know. All right.

01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:48.180
Let's see, moving on.

01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:51.180
Loki, I know you've been following this a little better than I have,

01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:56.180
but I know there was some big news in the Europe DDR scene this week.

01:11:56.180 --> 01:12:01.180
Yeah, they announced their new Dancing Stage game,

01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:04.180
which I remember had a really dumb name to it.

01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:09.180
It's like Dancing Stage Fusion. It's like Dancing Stage Happy Fun Time.

01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:12.180
I don't know what the hell it's called, but it's like something.

01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:15.180
Anyways, and it's got all the crap that was in...

01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:17.180
It's Dancing Stage Fusion.

01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:20.180
No, it's not Dancing Stage Fusion. It's called something else.

01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:22.180
Hold on. I'm going to look at these pictures here.

01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:24.180
Oh, Dancing Stage Day Glow Mix. Was that it?

01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:26.180
Day Glow Mix. That's what it was.

01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:29.180
No, no, no. That was what somebody said they should call it.

01:12:29.180 --> 01:12:31.180
That's not what they really call it.

01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:37.260
at the pictures of the cabinet. Let's see, it's Dancing Stage Fusion. That's what somebody

01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:41.660
on Freaks said it should be called because of the way it looked. See, Dancing Stage,

01:12:41.660 --> 01:12:46.040
not Dayquil. Whatever. Anyway, so yeah, Dancing Stage Fusion. It's got all the same stuff

01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:52.160
as the home version. Plus, a few other licensed songs I saw were on there, which you can read

01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:57.000
off for me since I don't have the list in front of me. Well now, okay, this is what's

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.120
interesting is that imagine if you took Extreme USA and put it in a cabinet and

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:04.760
change the song list a little bit that's pretty much what you got with this mix

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:10.360
yes what sounds like anyway here's the song list three two one stars a a stupid

01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:16.340
barber across the nightmare am3p be lovin believe can't stop falling in love

01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:22.920
speed mix candy star colors for extreme destiny lovers dive dynamite rave soda

01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:28.560
mix firefly familiar feeling whatever that is healing vision angelic mix

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:32.280
heaven and earth which i think is a licensed song it's raining men you know

01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:38.240
that one kakumei keep on moving kids in america ladies night la senorita and la

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:42.520

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:48.120
better make it better so real mix Mickey Orion 7-8 sieve mix paranoia max dirty

01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:58.360
The Rage Mix, Rapper's Delight, A Hip Hop, A Hip It To The Hop, Still In My Heart, Sink,

01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:08.920
Tomorrow Perfume, Tough Enough, Trip Machine, Try To Love You, Une De Toi, Waiting For Tonight,

01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:12.820
You're Not Here, and Your Rain, The Rage Mix.

01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:16.720
And that's not all of them, that's just what was on the demo cabinet that they had.

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:21.420
not everything that's gonna be on this mix. Not everything that's gonna be in there, there's a lot more stuff.

01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:26.220
So, um, it looks pretty good so far, but, I mean, granted, it's just exactly like

01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:29.580
Dancy Stage Fusion, or DDR Extreme,

01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:32.180
you know, the home versions.

01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:35.900
But hey, it's something new, so, yay!

01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:38.800
I wonder if they're gonna bring anything over here. Probably not.

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:42.840
Who knows, you might get lucky, some of them might import it, I don't see why not, I mean,

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:49.080
People import stuff from, you know, Korea and, you know, China and Japan and stuff.

01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:50.320
Why not from Europe?

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:53.400
I mean, it makes sense to me.

01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:55.940
But that's what's going on.

01:14:55.940 --> 01:15:06.120
And I don't think they really announced when they're going to be releasing that, but we're

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:09.480
thinking probably the end of this year.

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:12.920
I think it'll be sooner than that.

01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:16.760
Whatever. You know they were showing In the Groove at this show too.

01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:20.720
Yeah, that was right. The In the Groove was being shown by,

01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:24.320
I forget what company it was, Bingoist. They had boasted that

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:27.440
their, um, what was it?

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:30.920
They have, um, at the show they had gotten

01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:34.560
200 orders for In the Groove for the UK.

01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:38.000
So that was kinda interesting. And they, um, officially announced

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.560
in the group to that was the other thing surprise which they

01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:44.920
I mean didn't really give any details on it they said yeah we're gonna make one

01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:49.640
so

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:53.280
I don't have another in the group debate on the show maybe they'll fix some of

01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:54.880
the problems with one in two

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:59.240
but I don't know I'm I them the longer longer this goes on

01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:02.520
the more and more I'm buying into the theory of Konami that's what you get

01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:06.080
for not putting out any more arcade mixes honestly

01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:10.520
they deserve in the groove to be out there at this point I just I don't know

01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:14.560
but I still think if they try to release in the groove on a home console there's

01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:19.320
gonna be issues I still say that and you can argue all you want but I'm welcome

01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:24.560
to my opinion so I can't wait for him to try I I really hope I hope I hope they

01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:28.200
do try to release on a home console so we can have this debate and get it over

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:37.600
with. Seriously. If anything, to watch a show like X play Rip It Apart. Well, I don't know.

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:44.880
I don't know if they would. I mean, a lot of, the casual gamer doesn't give a shit.

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:50.600
Right? True. That's how, you know, pieces of crap like Britney's Dance Beat get out

01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:57.040
there and get played. I mean, people call Pump It Up that dance game and don't realize

01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:02.040
You know what ever happened to fucking Pump It Up coming to the Japanese PlayStation 2?

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:05.040
That's a game that should be, you know, fucking brought over here.

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:11.040
I mean, it's doing well in, like, all these other countries, but, you know, no one wants to bring it over here, obviously, because of the lawsuits and shit.

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:22.040
But yet, stuff like, you know, fucking In The Groove gets out there, I don't understand how, you know, one can be okay and the other one can't.

01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:24.040
You see what I'm saying?

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:32.760
don't know so I don't get it but nothing's going on all right I promised

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:36.540
that we would open up the Skype line so that's exactly what I'm gonna do if you

01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:41.540
want to call into the show head on over to www.orangelanosradio.com and click

01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:48.440
on interact with us I do request Skype actually upgraded to version 1.1 earlier

01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:51.500
this week or no I'm sorry actually was earlier this month it was a little while

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:56.380
ago and they have some new features in it so make sure you're upgrade the

01:17:56.380 --> 01:18:02.060
latest version hi you're on orange ons radio like Dennis Aku here hello Zaku

01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:08.080
how are you fine what's on your mind well I'm just looking over you know now

01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:12.540
that DDR frequent went back up again I was looking over the Dancing States thread

01:18:12.540 --> 01:18:17.460
and apparently to my surprise during them for some reason during it during

01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:35.460
During the whole event, I looked at, you know, I saw two pictures, one of a person, you know, one of the, you know, Konami's area where they had Fusion, there was only one girl playing, and another one with the Pump It Up Exceed 2 section, where there's like, what, uh, ten, like thirty, like about forty people right there carding up.

01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:38.460
Yeah, it's one of the most recent posts on the thread, I know what you're talking about.

01:18:38.460 --> 01:18:46.460
Yes, and I'm surprised, I thought we were supposed to be behind something like this 100%. I don't get it.

01:18:46.460 --> 01:19:00.460
Well, from the looks of it, it looks like that there was some type of event going on at the Pump It Up booth, and so all those people were there, and whereas Dancing Stage just kind of had the machine out there.

01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:11.460
Hmm, I don't know, I guess I don't know if I should accept that as an excuse. Anyways, now that we have, now that DDR itself already hit at least 1.2 billion last year...

01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:20.460
Zach, I just want to say, for all you know, I mean, we don't know because we weren't there, but for all we know, there was a topless girl playing Pump It Up at that moment.

01:19:20.460 --> 01:19:22.460
Really? Not just...

01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:27.460
For all you know, so you don't know why all those people were there, but that's one possible reason.

01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:31.460
If you look at the picture, they all kind of have that, ooh, boobies look on their face.

01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:47.460
Right. Anyways, now that DDR has already sold 1.2 million last year, totaling up to 2.5 million, which, if I'm not mistaken, should almost count for a quarter of all DDR sales worldwide.

01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:50.460
I'm going on fuzzy math right now.

01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:52.460
I don't have the latest figures.

01:19:52.460 --> 01:20:00.460
This should be the perfect opportunity to justify a new arcade mix.

01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:05.460
We already have the evidence that this game is profitable in this country.

01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:10.460
And so, I don't know, there has to be something done, some sort of action.

01:20:10.460 --> 01:20:14.460
We already know people who can make it happen.

01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:24.380
If that doesn't happen, we just got to push, you know, we got to basically, you know, we just got to stay on top of this 110%, you know what I'm saying?

01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:34.140
Well, I hear what you're saying, honestly, you're preaching to the choir here, you're preaching to the choir here, I'm not going to disagree with you, you are absolutely right, I think that we need to be doing a new USA mix.

01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:36.140
We got proof, we have just...

01:20:36.140 --> 01:20:39.140
But, I think that the people who...

01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:41.140
Yeah, we got to get a new arcade mix.

01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:45.620
People who have made it happen previously are trying to make it happen again.

01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:48.260
I don't know this for a fact, but I would assume.

01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:51.540
I know that there's people that love DDR trying to make it happen.

01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:56.860
I don't doubt that they're trying again, but you know, sometimes it's a matter of it's

01:20:56.860 --> 01:20:58.340
just got to be the right time.

01:20:58.340 --> 01:21:00.400
You got to get the people to say the right thing.

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:03.340
I don't know what it's going to take.

01:21:03.340 --> 01:21:10.100
But you don't see silent scope websites out there.

01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:14.860
You don't see Silent Scope websites out there with 50,000 dedicated members.

01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:20.020
To my knowledge, there is no internet radio station dedicated to the game Silent Scope.

01:21:20.020 --> 01:21:21.220
And there's two for DDR.

01:21:21.220 --> 01:21:22.540
We can definitely start.

01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:23.540
We could start one.

01:21:23.540 --> 01:21:24.680
This is a cult following.

01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:28.660
You have a game here that...

01:21:28.660 --> 01:21:29.660
That's the thing.

01:21:29.660 --> 01:21:30.660
You have a cult following.

01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:36.700
You have people who love this game to the point that it consumes their lives to an extent.

01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:42.700
They basically, you know, they have purpose to make something happen.

01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:46.700
And in this case, we could go after a new arcade mix.

01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:55.700
The thing is, we gotta make sure we gotta preach to the choir, to people who have seen the sites.

01:21:55.700 --> 01:22:02.700
That way we start some sort of movement that could be legitimate and aiming towards a common goal.

01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:07.760
Okay, your voice is fading out a little bit here. We had some weird connection issues in your last statement there.

01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:14.100
But I got the gist of what you're saying there. You just, you would like to see the masses get together and do something.

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:17.360
Basically.

01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:23.240
I think... I doubt I would, you know, I doubt to see something that perfect, but you know, it's worth a shot.

01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:25.840
I think the most we can do as fans right now,

01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:31.440
continue to support the games. When the home mixes come out, buy the new home mixes as they come out,

01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:36.480
support the arcade mixes that are already out there and you know just keep

01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:41.760
showing that there's a demand out there for dance games and I hate to say it but

01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:46.360
maybe supporting in the groove god I can't believe I just said that would

01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:50.840
show folks that there's still a demand out there for dance games although I

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:56.960
don't know I mean I still have mixed feelings on in the groove yeah all right

01:22:56.960 --> 01:23:07.960
Well, I'm going to let you go, buddy, because we've got connection issues, but I understand what you're saying, and I hope we can all band together in one happy Bamani Rainbow family.

01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:10.960
Take care, Zaku. Have a good one.

01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:18.960
I think he was behind. I think he, like, it was weird. I think he was hearing us about five seconds after we said something. Maybe that's a weird Skype thing, I don't know.

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:21.960
Anything you guys want to add to that?

01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:25.960
No? All right.

01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:28.920
well skype lines open again if somebody else wants to give us a call

01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:32.240
we certainly would love to hear what you have to say

01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:35.300
otherwise I guess we're gonna go ahead and get into the orange launch radio cage

01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:37.080
match next so it'd be something exciting

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:41.200
I'm checking out what's going on in the chat room there

01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:45.720
I'm

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:48.700
basically the chat room just kinda saying didn't so-and-so say that there

01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:50.000
was going to be a new mix

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:55.480
didn't so-and-so say this now honestly until Konami puts out the press release

01:23:55.480 --> 01:24:03.640
it's all hearsay all right I guess what we'll do is we're going to close down

01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:06.840
the skyline for right now and what we'll do is we'll go into the Orange Andreo

01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:09.880
cage match and we'll open it back up again after the cage match so if you

01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:14.700
were thinking about calling in and you want to later then oh actually we're

01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:18.360
getting a call right now I'll go ahead and take this one hi you're on Orange

01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:20.360
Hey, what's going on? This is Phoenix.

01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:22.360
Hello Phoenix, how are you?

01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:25.360
Hey.

01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:26.360
What's on your mind?

01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:31.360
Hello? What's on your mind?

01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:35.360
Can you hear me, buddy? What's on your mind?

01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:36.360
Hey, what's going on?

01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:41.360
Not much, just, uh, I wanted to say hey to Jamie. Hope she's feeling better.

01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:45.360
I don't know. Just chilling out, you know? Listening to the show.

01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:48.920
show. Jamie's in the kitchen getting herself a drink so she can feel a little

01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:56.720
better there. Yeah. Anything on your mind, any comments, response to things

01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:00.680
we've been talking about in the show so far, such as the new Europe DDR mix or

01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:07.440
you know? I don't know, there just needs to be a new DDR for the US. It's just bogus

01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:12.200
that they would just drop it like that. Well there will be a new US mix, it's

01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:16.520
just the home it's kind of focused on home right now it is kind of weird well

01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:21.240
if you think about it though the US arcade mix has stopped a long long time

01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:25.600
ago they really did we only ever had one true US arcade mix and it was kind of a

01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:29.760
mediocre game at best but it's the Japanese ones that have really stopped

01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:34.880
yeah it was sort of shaky there but I don't know I think they could do if they

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:37.800
really wanted to they could do what they wanted they could come out with a good

01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:41.620
one yeah I know I know and it's you know what's interesting though is that you

01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:45.320
I don't see Konami of Japan putting out this press release going,

01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:49.080
ooh, DDR Festival sold 1.2 million copies this year.

01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:51.240
You didn't see that press release.

01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:52.240
Yeah, that is true.

01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:55.120
I mean, I don't know.

01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:56.240
I don't know.

01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:58.640
It just seems like a lot of this stuff is going down.

01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:03.280
Like, those websites that got shut down the other night, what was it?

01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:06.120
DDR UK and stuff?

01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:06.920
Well, I don't know.

01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:09.680
Are you talking about like DDR UK getting shut down?

01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:11.680
Yeah, those websites getting shut down.

01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:18.680
Yeah, but we know that it has nothing to do with Konami. That was more of the MP3s in the song pack, at least assumably.

01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:23.680
Now, we're making a lot of assumptions here, but assumably, it was the MP3s that were inside the song packs.

01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:30.680
And remember that, if I'm not mistaken, Loki, correct me if I'm wrong, I wasn't a big DDRUK user, but they didn't just have the official song packs.

01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:36.680
They had fan ones too, right? Am I correct? Because they did contests and stuff, right?

01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:47.680
They didn't have those, but they had links to, like, the shoey, whatever, his little, like, museum, symphile museum stuff, which I'm sure had a lot of crap in it.

01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:59.680
Yeah, well, I don't know. I would just, I think StepMania and stuff like that, people are gonna get into that more and move that way, you know, because that's customizable to how you want it.

01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:09.680
And I agree, and I think a lot of the cult scene is kind of in there as it is, but until Stepmania is something that's over the counter, I don't think it's a real threat.

01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:11.680
Yeah, that is true, though.

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:16.680
It just kind of keeps the cult thing going, and I think that's why Konami hasn't stepped in and done anything about it.

01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:20.680
But I think if Stepmania were to be something that was sold over the counter, well, then there'd be an issue.

01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:25.680
But then again, what is in the groove? In the groove is Stepmania, basically.

01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:26.680
That is, yeah.

01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:32.120
so I don't know, but until, and that's why I say that I don't think Konami's gonna do

01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:36.920
anything about In the Groove unless they try to invade on the home market, but of course,

01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:40.000
you know, In the Groove says they have the patents, okay, whatever, fine, I'm not gonna

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:44.680
dispute that, but I do think if they try to go to the home route, there's gonna be a bit

01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:49.920
of, uh, clashing heads there, because that's Konami's baby right now, it's obviously, they're

01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:52.920
putting out press releases on it, you know it's their baby, so.

01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:56.920
I mean, they have to be planning to do something to put out a press release.

01:27:56.920 --> 01:28:01.920
I mean, that would just be silly to be like, we sold a million copies and then drop it.

01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:05.920
I was just a little disappointed that they didn't announce anything the same day.

01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:08.920
We all know that DDR Mario is in the making in Japan.

01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:13.920
So, why not tell us U.S. folks who are going to get it? Because we better be getting it.

01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:17.920
I'm not liking the DDR Mario. I think that's going to be a little bogus.

01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:21.240
I think Mario's a little played out. That was sorta

01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:24.960
in the 90s. Regardless, love or hate Mario,

01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:29.120
it's more DDR. Yeah, that is true. So, I don't know.

01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:33.560
Alright, any other comments you got for us? No, that's pretty much about it.

01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:38.360
Just wanted to call in. It's my first time. Well, thank you for calling in. It's your virgin

01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:39.640
phone call. We appreciate it.

01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:43.240
We're glad to initiate you into Orange Lounge. Ha, ha, ha, ha.

01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:46.280
And Jamie, he did say, you may have missed it because you were in the kitchen, but he did say he

01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:47.160
hopes you feel better.

01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:49.160
Thank you, I do too.

01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:27.160
Remember boys and girls, in order to participate in the cage match, you must be in our chat room. www.orangelaungeradio.com, click on chat.

01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:33.160
The way the cage match works, we play three songs for your listening pleasure or listening displeasure.

01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:44.160
You pick your favorite. The winning song per the chat room goes into rotation all week long here on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music and More program.

01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:48.560
Which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week when we're not live?

01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:52.520
You get to hear a clip of last week's winner because

01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:56.120
supposedly you were already listening last week or the week before, so you've heard

01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:57.200
the whole song already.

01:29:57.200 --> 01:30:00.880
So here's a clip of last week's winner. It's a group called

01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:04.680
Echo Image. They did the song Skulk in UltraMix 2, you know,

01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:07.800
and they have a new song. It's called Endless Day.

01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:12.400
So it's last week's winner. It's been winning two weeks in a row now, so if it

01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:16.560
wins tonight that'll be week number three halfway to retirement let's see if

01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:23.560
we can do it. Here's a clip. Song number one, Echo Image, Endless Day.

01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:52.560
But I once said I could be wrong

01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:59.560
Yes, I have my reasons after all

01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:07.560
Can't find the way to come, we're going back in time

01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:16.560
This girl is one of the only ones lost in her mind

01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:22.560
Make no mistake, you're gonna find another way

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:31.560
Left behind, there's another and that's it

01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:37.560
And we fall

01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:52.560
And we fall

01:31:52.560 --> 01:32:18.560
Depending on those words that once belonged They used to make much sense but I was wrong

01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:25.560
Embracing my events of yesterday

01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:32.560
Yes, I should see you walking my own way

01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:36.560
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:42.560
To everyone we've done and back and done

01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:55.840
All right, though, song number one in tonight's cage match, Echo Image, Endless Day, a clip

01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:56.840
of that there.

01:32:56.840 --> 01:33:01.640
All right, let's see if it does it again tonight, but we've got to get the challengers in.

01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:03.960
First up is DarkSakurasPick.

01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:04.960
What'd you pick for us tonight?

01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:05.960
Some Eurobeat song.

01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:11.160
It's been a while since we've had some Eurobeat in the cage match.

01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:17.660
It's Dream, um, different version of Night of Fire, but it's a different mix of the sort of rock mix. I don't remember the name of it.

01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:19.660
Now Dream originally did Night of Fire.

01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:20.160
No.

01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:21.660
No, I thought they did. I'm sorry.

01:33:21.660 --> 01:33:24.160
No, that was the guy who did Night of Fire.

01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:24.660
Oh, my bad.

01:33:24.660 --> 01:33:26.160
And then Dream, I think, redid it.

01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:32.660
Okay, so we got Dream, and then they did Night of Fire, which you might know as a 2DX song or a Para Para song.

01:33:32.660 --> 01:33:34.660
This isn't necessarily a Eurobeat version of it.

01:33:34.660 --> 01:33:39.660
Right, this is a different version. It's Dream of Dream mix. Hmm.

01:33:39.660 --> 01:33:42.660
So we shall see. Anything else you want to say about it?

01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:43.660
No.

01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:45.660
Alright, here it is. Song number two.

01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:48.660
Night of Fire, Dream of Dream Mix. Enjoy!

01:34:15.660 --> 01:34:17.660
Don't go away

01:34:21.660 --> 01:34:23.660
Don't go away

01:37:23.660 --> 01:37:35.660
Night of fire!

01:37:35.660 --> 01:37:43.660
Night of fire!

01:37:43.660 --> 01:37:51.500
Alrighty, that was song number two, Dream with Night of Fire, the dream of dream mix.

01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:55.220
Did we here in the studio find that song to be dreamy?

01:37:55.220 --> 01:37:56.220
Or not?

01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:57.220
Jamie.

01:37:57.220 --> 01:37:58.220
I don't care.

01:37:58.220 --> 01:38:02.460
I guess that's her final word on the matter.

01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:03.460
Uh, Loki.

01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:04.460
No.

01:38:04.460 --> 01:38:05.460
No, no, no.

01:38:05.460 --> 01:38:06.460
No, no.

01:38:06.460 --> 01:38:12.780
I was too listening to it, it's Night of Fire, what else do I need to know?

01:38:12.780 --> 01:38:13.780
Weren't fucking listening to it.

01:38:13.780 --> 01:38:14.780
Get your headphones on.

01:38:14.780 --> 01:38:16.900
On one side of my head.

01:38:16.900 --> 01:38:18.900
Just like DJ's do.

01:38:18.900 --> 01:38:24.340
no I'm sorry I did listen to it and you know what it's still night of fire so it

01:38:24.340 --> 01:38:29.700
gets like a seven that's about it though no more because it is eurobeat the

01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:40.380
eurobeat part of it you know really I I had a lot of fear going into that but it

01:38:40.380 --> 01:38:43.740
actually was pretty neat I actually thought it would be more eurobeat than

01:38:43.740 --> 01:38:47.700
it ended up being it wasn't too bad it was kind of catchy I give it like an

01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:58.700
Angel. I like it. It's your beat. Your beat is fun. Um, eight and a half. Whatever. Close enough.

01:38:58.700 --> 01:39:04.700
Alright, let's get into Loki's pick. Loki, what did you pick tonight?

01:39:04.700 --> 01:39:11.700
Um, my song is from a group called Osiris, and it's Oneness with the Universe, is what it's called.

01:39:11.700 --> 01:39:13.860
off of them trans compilation I got a while back.

01:39:16.260 --> 01:39:17.260
It's good. I don't know.

01:39:19.660 --> 01:39:20.460
Alright, let's...

01:39:21.260 --> 01:39:23.660
It's only because you don't wanna fuckin' hear Girls again.

01:39:23.660 --> 01:39:27.100
And goddamnit, if this doesn't go in, you can expect Girls next week.

01:39:27.100 --> 01:39:27.600
Got it?

01:39:30.100 --> 01:39:33.860
We will see. Osiris. Oneness with the universe.

01:39:33.860 --> 01:39:40.860
let's check it out song number three

01:40:03.860 --> 01:40:09.860
And they do, don't they do, don't they do...

01:40:11.860 --> 01:40:13.860
Oh, well done, y'all.

01:40:14.860 --> 01:40:17.860
How can I stop you?

01:40:17.860 --> 01:40:25.860
We can make it through, we can do, can do, can do

01:41:17.860 --> 01:41:19.860
Oh

01:43:47.860 --> 01:44:12.860
Let's see what folks thought of Osiris, Oneness with the Universe.

01:44:12.860 --> 01:44:16.860
Were we oneness with that song or were we better off without that song?

01:44:16.860 --> 01:44:24.860
uh, i'm drugged, and it was enhancing my drugged state of mind, so it gets a 7.

01:44:24.860 --> 01:44:26.860
alright, uh, loki!

01:44:28.860 --> 01:44:36.860
i don't know, the clip i listened to was good, but no, the whole song was just eh, why did i put it in there? fucking a, i should've put girls in there again.

01:44:36.860 --> 01:44:38.860
that's right, next week.

01:44:39.860 --> 01:44:40.860
score?

01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:49.700
I get the four because it sounded too much like you know and yeah that song

01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:54.060
you know what with that song I could really picture myself at a rave taking a

01:44:54.060 --> 01:45:01.340
nap boring five angel it was okay but you know how those type of songs are

01:45:01.340 --> 01:45:06.700
they get kind of repetitive so I was semi zoning out at the end of it so I'll

01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:08.700
I'll be nice and give it a six.

01:45:10.700 --> 01:45:14.700
Wow. Angel usually doesn't give anything below a nine. That's pretty harsh.

01:45:14.700 --> 01:45:19.700
Alright, let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight.

01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:24.700
Song number one, Endless Day with, I'm sorry, Echo Image with Endless Day.

01:45:24.700 --> 01:45:47.060
Song number two, Dream with Night of Fire, the Dream of Dream mix.

01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:52.060
This is song number three, Osiris, Oneness with the Universe.

01:45:52.060 --> 01:46:07.060
Alright, place vote now, send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

01:46:07.060 --> 01:46:10.060
You know he's right, when you listen to a little clip of that song it sounds pretty cool.

01:46:10.060 --> 01:46:16.060
Alright, if I were to just play the clips, I probably would have given that song like a nine.

01:46:16.060 --> 01:46:18.060
Alright.

01:46:18.060 --> 01:46:23.060
Maybe we'll do that for the cage match one night. It'll just be a clip match.

01:46:23.060 --> 01:46:26.060
Then we can put like 30 songs in it would be awesome.

01:46:26.060 --> 01:46:27.060
Alright, we'll see.

01:46:27.060 --> 01:46:31.060
Uh, so send a private, remember private message.

01:46:31.060 --> 01:46:34.060
Some folks are yelling out their votes in the chat room.

01:46:34.060 --> 01:46:38.060
Doesn't work that way. Send a private message. If you don't know how to do that, ask.

01:46:38.060 --> 01:46:40.060
All I gotta do is ask.

01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:46.060
Hi Bugd, I noticed Bugd walked into the room while we were doing the cage match there.

01:46:46.060 --> 01:46:53.060
Another local Techmaster type person, not THE Techmassa of Orange Lawns Radio, but A Techmassa.

01:46:53.060 --> 01:47:00.060
Wait, get a mic, we can't hear you. He says get a mic.

01:47:00.060 --> 01:47:06.060
That's the best shirt ever.

01:47:06.060 --> 01:47:10.060
Bugs is wearing a shirt that says, will work for bandwidth.

01:47:10.060 --> 01:47:14.060
And it's true. I have.

01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:18.060
Unfortunately, you are not THE Tecmasa of Oranzons Radio.

01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:22.060
Who do I have to kill? Loki. And then probably you'd have to kill VXJs

01:47:22.060 --> 01:47:26.060
and XV2, because really, he's a big tech guy for this station too.

01:47:26.060 --> 01:47:30.060
He's more of the web god slash internet penis.

01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:34.060
Then Loki's a Tecmasa, you're just

01:47:34.060 --> 01:47:36.060
A Techmaster.

01:47:36.060 --> 01:47:37.060
Okay, I can live with A.

01:47:37.060 --> 01:47:39.060
Like, you're from another department.

01:47:41.060 --> 01:47:43.060
I'll take Techmaster Overlord.

01:47:45.060 --> 01:47:47.060
That might work, we'll see.

01:47:48.060 --> 01:47:51.060
You were a Techmaster before being a Techmaster was cool, really.

01:47:51.060 --> 01:47:52.060
This is very true.

01:47:54.060 --> 01:47:57.060
Bugden and I went to not only high school together, but junior high school together.

01:47:57.060 --> 01:48:00.060
A long time ago. I know Bugden a long fucking time.

01:48:00.060 --> 01:48:02.060
And I know Rob's real name. It's Robert.

01:48:30.060 --> 01:48:34.500
gets for not putting out a new arcade mix lately. Well now, In the Groove is

01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:39.240
going to have some competition. It's a game called Dance Tracks and it's

01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:43.080
another new game being put out by some folks. Loki, have you heard about this one

01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:50.480
at all? No, I don't keep my finger on the pulse of crap. Well, here we go. You can

01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:58.120
actually look at this website if you want to. dtx.pulsenetwork.net. I will be

01:48:58.120 --> 01:49:03.760
be so kind as to post a link in the chatroom there, if you want. Now, there really isn't

01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:09.260
a whole lot there besides a lot of blue, but they do have some screenshots from the game,

01:49:09.260 --> 01:49:14.560
except the screenshots they have are not from the in-game mode. It is the select play mode

01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:22.920
screen, which, woo! I'm so, woo, I'm so excited. But what they do post in here is they post

01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:29.420
a partial song list. So you look at the track list here, and I notice that L.M.K. is on

01:49:29.420 --> 01:49:34.000
the track list. Now, hmm, that's interesting. And let's see, I noticed this, this I thought

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:41.000
was interesting. Ace of Bass with Cruel Summer, Bad Religion with Inner Logic, Mindless Self-Indulgence,

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:47.500
yeah. Mindless Self-Indulgence has a couple tracks on there. Jenny Rom. What precisely

01:49:47.500 --> 01:49:51.220
are you to do to these songs? There's other few ones though that these are a little bit

01:49:51.220 --> 01:49:54.720
more important a beat drop with phase one beat drop would be the guy that did

01:49:54.720 --> 01:50:00.580
days and destroy the remix of hysteria DM Ashura with neon rush so I mean at

01:50:00.580 --> 01:50:04.100
least it got some pretty decent people

01:50:05.500 --> 01:50:09.260
yeah so it looks pretty good at least they've got some good musicians behind

01:50:09.260 --> 01:50:13.620
it and if I remember correctly I do remember hearing this way the hell back

01:50:13.620 --> 01:50:18.380
in the day because they were actually going in the Bamai style music

01:50:18.380 --> 01:50:26.380
Um, production thread, and they were asking people to help them out with, um, game music and stuff, and so I know these people, like, signed on there.

01:50:26.380 --> 01:50:32.380
So that's where I remember this from, at least. But, hey, you know, at least they got better people making music.

01:50:32.380 --> 01:50:42.380
So, I see what they have to, you know, show first, you know, can't really go by much of this, uh, menu graphics crap, so...

01:50:42.380 --> 01:50:44.380
I dunno. Watch it.

01:50:44.380 --> 01:50:46.380
It's coming soon. Here's the staff.

01:51:14.380 --> 01:51:25.780
that many of his stuff. Hm. It's kinda neat. We'll see. We'll see. There's really nothing

01:51:25.780 --> 01:51:31.020
here for me. Yet. We'll see. I'll keep my eye on this and we'll see. That's about all

01:51:31.020 --> 01:51:41.020
I can say. Don't fuck it up, guys! Alright, uh, let's see. Do they really? I totally missed

01:51:41.020 --> 01:51:46.720
that. Al Mullet says Queen of Love is on there. Oh my God, they're right. Wildside with Queen

01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:50.780
of Love is on there. That's awesome. That's like an English version of Bequia, although

01:51:50.780 --> 01:51:54.900
it's not really because it's not actually the lyrics in English. It's just the melody.

01:51:54.900 --> 01:51:59.220
But that's kind of neat. Okay, so they have a pretty decent track list so far. It's very

01:51:59.220 --> 01:52:09.900
DDR Chibi-ish with a little bit of American flavor in there. We'll see. Interesting. More

01:52:09.900 --> 01:52:15.960
as it develops. Skypline's open again. If you would like to send us a call, you can

01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:20.460
just head on over to www.orangelaungeradio.com and click on interact with us, and you can

01:52:20.460 --> 01:52:24.140
call us on the Skypline. I notice not a lot of people on the Skypline tonight, so I'm

01:52:24.140 --> 01:52:27.600
thinking we might not get a whole lot of calls, but it is open. If you do want to give us

01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:33.780
a call, again, please make sure you have the latest version. I'm going to be tallying up

01:52:33.780 --> 01:52:37.460
those votes for Cagematch pretty soon. What else is in the news this week? I had another

01:52:37.460 --> 01:52:44.460
Another article I wanted to talk about, and then I got sidetracked with this DTX thing.

01:52:44.460 --> 01:52:49.500
Loki, how about what's going on in the sim scene? Why not? We'll get your sim update

01:52:49.500 --> 01:52:50.500
done.

01:52:50.500 --> 01:52:57.380
What's not going on in the sim scene is more like it. Still, DDRUK is still down. Same

01:52:57.380 --> 01:53:01.900
with DDR Maniacs. It's not looking good for DDR Maniacs. They've been down for months,

01:53:01.900 --> 01:53:04.780
So, say goodbye to them probably.

01:53:04.780 --> 01:53:07.420
Uhm, DDRUK still down for a while.

01:53:07.420 --> 01:53:10.620
I'm gonna bet that they're not coming back either.

01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:14.220
Uhm, and then you've got Bamai style.

01:53:14.220 --> 01:53:17.300
Uhm, nothing really too much going on there.

01:53:17.300 --> 01:53:22.340
Uh, pretty much the only other thing, like I mentioned last week, there's, uhm, a bunch

01:53:22.340 --> 01:53:28.660
of different, like, food mix type stuff that's coming out actually.

01:53:28.660 --> 01:53:32.780
a bunch of different ones that I was testing out a while back

01:53:32.780 --> 01:53:34.260
like last week or so

01:53:34.260 --> 01:53:35.620
that are uh...

01:53:35.620 --> 01:53:41.820
in the works

01:53:41.820 --> 01:53:45.220
let me see here

01:53:45.220 --> 01:53:47.100
okay

01:53:47.100 --> 01:53:49.940
we've got

01:53:49.940 --> 01:53:53.660
let me pulse up real quick here

01:53:53.660 --> 01:53:55.100
well we are getting a call

01:53:55.100 --> 01:53:57.300
okay take that call

01:53:57.300 --> 01:54:01.060
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

01:54:01.060 --> 01:54:02.860
Hello?

01:54:02.860 --> 01:54:06.980
Hello, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

01:54:06.980 --> 01:54:10.580
Can you hear us? Ah, there we go. There you go. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

01:54:10.580 --> 01:54:14.100
Who is this? This is Rai-Chan. Hi Rai-Chan, how are you?

01:54:14.100 --> 01:54:18.380
It's been a while since I've called you guys. I thought I'd just call and say hi.

01:54:18.380 --> 01:54:23.020
It has been a little while. Hello to you, my friend.

01:54:23.020 --> 01:54:27.620
Yes, um, Joyce is sitting over here working on my katamari hat again.

01:54:27.620 --> 01:54:29.620
She's doing the last little bit.

01:54:29.620 --> 01:54:32.620
Hello, Joyce, as well. Hope you're doing well.

01:54:32.620 --> 01:54:36.120
Yeah, he says hello, Joyce, saying he hopes you're doing well. She waves.

01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:37.920
Alright, so...

01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:39.820
Because I've got the headphones on, so...

01:54:39.820 --> 01:54:42.320
Now, you guys are making hats together?

01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:47.720
Yeah, well, she hasn't taught me how to crochet yet, which is the next project.

01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:51.320
Teaching me how to do it. She's working on a katamari hat for me,

01:54:51.320 --> 01:54:53.960
and then she's going to do one for Jason too.

01:54:53.960 --> 01:54:57.000
What exactly is a katamari hat?

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:01.880
There was a girl that sold a hat on eBay recently for $130

01:55:01.880 --> 01:55:06.160
that was a crocheted hat that was like a katamari ball.

01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:11.440
It had the little bumps on it like the katamari have.

01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:12.440
And the little hearts.

01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:15.280
I noticed on the little hat it had little hearts in the bumps.

01:55:15.280 --> 01:55:16.440
So cute.

01:55:16.440 --> 01:55:17.200
Virgo one.

01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:20.200
Mine's the one with all the hearts and the pink

01:55:20.200 --> 01:55:26.440
and all that sort of stuff. I don't have a really good one in my journal, but I did post

01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:31.720
one in Dimashie Loving. So, if you want to see a picture of this, go to the live journal

01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:36.880
and look up Dimashie Loving and there's a picture of it. Here, let me see if I can find

01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:41.600
that one real quick and I'll post a link in the chat room. Awesome. Chat room again over

01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:46.360
at www.orangehontrader.com, click on chat. So, you're going to be learning how to crochet

01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:52.280
and you'll be doing a hat as well for yourself or for, or no, the one being made now is for

01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:53.280
you.

01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:54.600
The one being made now is for me.

01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:56.400
And then you're going to make one for Jason.

01:55:56.400 --> 01:55:59.040
Well, she's actually got one started for Jason.

01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:00.040
Oh, okay.

01:56:00.040 --> 01:56:03.280
But you're going to learn how to crochet because it's fun.

01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:04.280
Yeah.

01:56:04.280 --> 01:56:05.280
Right on, right on.

01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:07.560
Well, how about, how about that DDR?

01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:09.320
Any DDR news you want to share?

01:56:09.320 --> 01:56:13.200
Um, well I started talking to Midihead last night.

01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:14.200
Oh yeah?

01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:34.200
He was saying something, because I started a step file for House of Joy, and recently just got things set up for Maxim, and I posted in his forum about it, and he sounds really interested. He might actually do some remixes specifically for StepMania.

01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:39.200
Wow, that's kind of neat. That guy is so cool.

01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:56.200
Minnie Head is the guy we had on the show, it was about a month ago now, it was a little while ago, it was awesome, he's a great guy and he's really, he loves this because he knows it's making him some new fans, he's made a lot of fans thanks to DDR, and that's cool, so you actually made some step files and he's cool with it, he thinks it's a neat idea, huh?

01:56:56.200 --> 01:57:02.200
Yeah, he had absolutely no problem with me even sharing them around.

01:57:02.200 --> 01:57:08.200
I was talking to him about maybe we can just take and put him up in the VIP area for his site.

01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:12.200
He was like, no, it might be pretty cool with you just sharing them around.

01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:16.200
Wow, very cool. Where can folks download this? Do you have it up on the web somewhere?

01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:22.200
No, actually I don't because I recently recut the MP3 for it.

01:57:22.200 --> 01:57:27.200
And then I need to give it back to Jason, because he was working on the heavy steps for it.

01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:31.200
Maybe once you guys are done, maybe we can work something out on orangelongstreet.com.

01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:32.200
Yeah.

01:57:32.200 --> 01:57:33.200
Maybe we can help you out.

01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:34.200
That'd be cool.

01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:36.200
All right, right on. Cool.

01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:38.200
So, anything else you want to share?

01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:40.200
No, not really.

01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:46.200
I got StepMania set up for hooking it up to my TV downstairs in the basement.

01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:47.200
Ah, that's fun.

01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:53.200
That's because I've got Joyce started playing DDR.

01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:57.200
She's only really been playing for about a month, seriously.

01:57:57.200 --> 01:57:59.200
And how's she doing after a month?

01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:02.200
She's actually just starting to get into heavy.

01:58:02.200 --> 01:58:04.200
She can do some six foot, some seven.

01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:06.200
Hmm. Not bad for a month. God.

01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:09.200
After a month, I think I was graduating to threes.

01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:10.200
So very nice stuff.

01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:13.200
You know, she's got those Asian genes in her.

01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:18.120
She's half Korean, so she's got it working for her.

01:58:18.120 --> 01:58:19.120
Very good.

01:58:19.120 --> 01:58:20.120
Very cool.

01:58:20.120 --> 01:58:21.120
Good job.

01:58:21.120 --> 01:58:22.120
Hey, Jamie just got back in the room.

01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:23.120
I've got to share this with Jamie.

01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:27.240
Did you know that Rai Chan and her friend Joyce, they're making Katamari hats from

01:58:27.240 --> 01:58:28.240
Katamari Damacy?

01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:29.240
And yeah.

01:58:29.240 --> 01:58:32.240
Yeah, you read the journals, so you probably know, but isn't that so cool?

01:58:32.240 --> 01:58:33.240
Yeah.

01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:34.240
Yeah.

01:58:34.240 --> 01:58:38.360
Yeah, right now, Joyce is the only one making them, so.

01:58:38.360 --> 01:58:39.360
Okay.

01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:41.840
But your moral support, and that counts for something.

01:58:41.840 --> 01:58:42.840
Yes.

01:58:42.840 --> 01:58:48.340
Very cool. Alright, Raichan, I'm gonna say goodbye, but thanks so much for calling in, and we hope to hear from you again sometime.

01:58:48.340 --> 01:58:49.140
Yeah.

01:58:49.140 --> 01:58:50.340
Alright, have a good one, buddy.

01:58:50.340 --> 01:58:51.040
Alright, goodbye.

01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:51.540
Bye.

01:58:52.740 --> 01:58:55.940
Okay, alright. Loki is gonna finish his sim file thought.

01:58:55.940 --> 01:59:03.540
As I was mentioning before, there's a whole bunch of stuff for, you know, those people out there that were looking for life after FoodMix.

01:59:03.540 --> 01:59:32.540
Um, starting off, um, there's a thread that was in, um, Bimani style on their DDR simulation stuff, and it's the, um, Japanese DDR fan mix watch, um, thread, and basically they have a few listed on here that you can go check out, starting with DDR XX mix, which is, um, they said they're currently testing it this week, and the song list so far, um, it's a lot of, like,

01:59:32.540 --> 01:59:38.540
Like, DMS stuff. It's kind of, um, I don't know how to really describe it.

01:59:38.540 --> 01:59:45.540
But, um, they've got... Let's see here. No, they kind of reverted back. It was...

01:59:45.540 --> 01:59:47.540
Nothing.

01:59:47.540 --> 01:59:52.540
Okay. Anyways, um, so I played it a little earlier this week. It's pretty decent.

01:59:52.540 --> 01:59:56.540
They've got some decent files for that, um, with videos in the background, that kind of thing.

01:59:56.540 --> 02:00:02.460
Then we have DDR D3 Mix, which is, um, they only have really one song done on it so far,

02:00:02.460 --> 02:00:07.140
the song called J2-19, uh, by Cranky, which is interesting.

02:00:07.140 --> 02:00:13.220
Uh, DDR E-Mix, which is all, um, anime J-pop, if you like that kind of stuff.

02:00:13.220 --> 02:00:18.260
Um, then we have Strawberry Steps, which is kind of more like an event, not really a mix,

02:00:18.260 --> 02:00:21.460
but, um, interesting stuff anyways.

02:00:21.460 --> 02:00:28.460
There was another one I found too, something about like pop candy or something mixed, but I don't have the link for that.

02:00:28.460 --> 02:00:39.460
Then there's a new theme also that's on the same thread, Stepmania Siberia style, which is basically it looks just like Techno Fiend, it's pretty cool to check it out.

02:00:39.460 --> 02:00:45.460
So yeah, that was pretty much what was going on in the sim scene, not really much.

02:00:45.460 --> 02:00:54.460
Of course, I mentioned last week that one bondage chick thing that was retarded, but yeah, that's everything.

02:00:55.460 --> 02:00:57.460
That was someone with too much free time.

02:00:58.460 --> 02:00:59.460
Agreed.

02:00:59.460 --> 02:01:00.460
And he wasn't getting laid.

02:01:01.460 --> 02:01:04.460
Alright, you guys want to hear who won tonight's cage match?

02:01:06.460 --> 02:01:07.460
Jamie says mmm.

02:01:08.460 --> 02:01:10.460
Alright, let's find out who won tonight's cage match.

02:01:10.460 --> 02:01:15.460
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new champion in the cage match this week, and it is...

02:01:19.460 --> 02:01:21.460
I don't fucking believe it.

02:01:21.460 --> 02:01:26.460
Night of Fire by a landslide, even. By a landslide.

02:01:26.460 --> 02:01:30.460
The other two songs combined did not take that one out.

02:01:30.460 --> 02:01:34.460
Wow. I'm surprised, because I just sort of threw it in.

02:01:34.460 --> 02:01:37.460
Well, there you have it. It's in there now. The winner...

02:01:37.460 --> 02:01:48.100
Dream. Night of Fire. I need to be sick more often. Tune in next week to see if Loki makes

02:01:48.100 --> 02:01:58.300
good on his promise. And maybe I'm gonna make a mean pic next week, too. We'll see. Alright.

02:01:58.300 --> 02:02:02.060
Let's go to a break, boys and girls. When we come back from this break, I think it's

02:02:02.060 --> 02:02:06.480
high time we got into the FUs of the week

02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:10.620
because damn it we're getting angsty

02:02:10.620 --> 02:02:12.840
in this break

02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:17.120
I'm doing fourth mix songs because I'm playing Hypnotic Crisis

02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:20.640
and if you were here with me the B4za mix because those songs are cool

02:02:20.640 --> 02:02:23.800
oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, we need Saints Go Marching

02:02:23.800 --> 02:02:27.600
yes we do, we're gonna do Saints Go Marching and we'll do Ninzabro

02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:31.960
hell with it it's a four song break damn you we'll be back after this

02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:38.960
get your fourth mix on. We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio.

02:03:01.960 --> 02:03:02.960
Hey!

02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:03.960
Hey!

02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:04.960
Hey!

02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:05.960
Hey!

02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:06.960
Hey!

02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:07.960
Hey!

02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:08.960
Hey!

02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:09.960
Hey!

02:03:09.960 --> 02:03:10.960
Hey!

02:03:40.960 --> 02:04:08.960
If you were here with me If you were here with me

02:04:08.960 --> 02:04:26.960
This ain't Sean and I am standing alone I think of you and wonder if you think of me too

02:04:26.960 --> 02:04:31.960
I'm back to the town that I was born in To think of my life and to start it over with you

02:04:31.960 --> 02:04:37.960
Cause you know we've been in a maze of love And we are losing control to get away

02:04:37.960 --> 02:04:40.960
Here I am walking on a hill in the south

02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:43.960
Life in my childhood, that seems like yesterday

02:04:43.960 --> 02:04:46.960
If you were here with me

02:04:46.960 --> 02:04:49.960
You could feel the way I do now

02:04:49.960 --> 02:04:52.960
If you were here with me

02:04:52.960 --> 02:04:54.960
You could see what I am looking for now

02:04:54.960 --> 02:05:11.960
Cause you know we've been in a maze of love, and we are losing control to get away.

02:05:11.960 --> 02:05:17.960
Here I am walking on the hill in this town, like in my childhood that seems like yesterday.

02:05:17.960 --> 02:05:23.460
If you were here with me, you could feel the way I do now

02:05:23.460 --> 02:05:28.960
If you were here with me, you could see what I am looking for now

02:05:28.960 --> 02:05:33.760
If you were here with me

02:05:58.960 --> 02:06:00.960
Oh

02:06:58.960 --> 02:07:00.960
Thanks for watching!

02:07:28.960 --> 02:07:56.960
I feel the heat, the vibrations on the streets No situation, it's got great complications

02:07:56.960 --> 02:07:58.760
She's part of people living life

02:07:58.760 --> 02:07:59.960
But it's always in the fast lane

02:07:59.960 --> 02:08:01.560
Like the yellow UK, I'm the Daphne

02:08:01.560 --> 02:08:02.960
I see too many blood stains

02:08:02.960 --> 02:08:04.360
Too many cars with these rings

02:08:04.360 --> 02:08:05.760
She's part of people seeing what's high

02:08:05.760 --> 02:08:07.160
I'm saving off like the sky

02:08:07.160 --> 02:08:08.560
Keep it real, I'm raking lies

02:08:08.560 --> 02:08:10.160
And I'm part of people at five

02:08:10.160 --> 02:08:11.360
This is your life, Lukey

02:08:11.360 --> 02:08:13.360
Gang, listen up, and stay with the pain

02:08:13.360 --> 02:08:15.360
Look at this! Yeah!

02:08:33.360 --> 02:08:37.360
Gaming radio, so uncensored

02:08:37.360 --> 02:08:40.360
that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:44.360
Uh, buch- uh, bukkake, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:08:44.360 --> 02:08:46.360
Pack's done.

02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:52.360
We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio. Did you miss us?

02:08:52.360 --> 02:08:54.360
I hope so.

02:08:54.360 --> 02:08:55.360
Sounds like their aim's improving.

02:08:55.360 --> 02:08:57.360
Yeah, I know. Hopefully your aim is improving.

02:08:57.360 --> 02:08:59.360
Are your allergies improving yet?

02:08:59.360 --> 02:09:00.360
When I lay down.

02:09:00.360 --> 02:09:02.360
Okay, well I hope you feel better.

02:09:02.360 --> 02:09:08.360
It's okay, I'm just laying- um, um, actually, this- this chair is so huge that I can lay across it.

02:09:08.360 --> 02:09:11.520
and I love that chair pretty comfortable

02:09:11.520 --> 02:09:14.840
I wanna make love to that chair just kidding I don't I won't

02:09:14.840 --> 02:09:17.800
I have to sit here not while you're laying in it anyway

02:09:17.800 --> 02:09:23.480
so I'm pissed off about something I know nobody cares

02:09:23.480 --> 02:09:27.440
where the fuck is Ultramix 2 song pack 8

02:09:27.440 --> 02:09:31.160
what the fuck it was announced like

02:09:31.160 --> 02:09:34.600
forever ago now I know

02:09:34.600 --> 02:09:39.240
from what I understand Konami submitted it and it's Microsoft's fault they're

02:09:39.240 --> 02:09:40.800
sitting on it or whatever

02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:44.820
god dammit release it already listen to these songs that are going to be an

02:09:44.820 --> 02:09:46.480
Ultramix 2 song pack number 8

02:09:46.480 --> 02:09:49.760
Cosmic Cowgirl love that song from D

02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:53.160
do I have clips of some of these songs I hope I do

02:09:53.160 --> 02:09:56.320
let me see if I got a little clip of Cowgirl or Cosmic Cowgirl

02:09:56.320 --> 02:09:59.960
we all know Cowgirl I'm thinking Cosmic Cowgirl

02:09:59.960 --> 02:10:06.520
this is like all the way from guitar freaks like what third mix?

02:10:06.520 --> 02:10:09.520
cosmic cowgirl was like my favorite song to play on drumania

02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:16.520
here it is

02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:24.160
that song rocks! I want that damn song

02:10:24.160 --> 02:10:29.800
and then this one I can't even pronounce but it's a fun song to play

02:10:29.800 --> 02:10:36.600
Ballalakya, Carried with the Wind by Julianne Frost in song pack eight.

02:10:36.600 --> 02:10:40.600
More Deep version 2.1, well we already have that one, I'm not so

02:10:40.600 --> 02:10:44.080
concerned with that one. In My Eyes, the Neuromix

02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:48.680
by Neuropa. That is so cool. Neuropa did like one of the coolest songs in UltraMix 2.

02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:51.120
They did Standing Still in Time and they sound like Erasure.

02:10:51.120 --> 02:10:54.920
I can't wait to see what they do to In My Eyes, it's gonna rock. And then Kind Lady,

02:10:54.920 --> 02:10:55.960
The Interlude.

02:10:55.960 --> 02:10:58.960
Notice about this song pack

02:10:58.960 --> 02:11:03.260
What a lot of people were bitching about with the Konami song packs is that they

02:11:03.260 --> 02:11:05.820
were recycling a lot of old garbage.

02:11:05.820 --> 02:11:09.500
Only one old song in this pack

02:11:09.500 --> 02:11:15.180
and really it's not even that old. It's only shown up in like

02:11:15.180 --> 02:11:19.020
what, two other releases? One in Japan, one in the US on PS2?

02:11:19.020 --> 02:11:22.140
So, more Deep version 2.1. Okay, you've seen it before.

02:11:22.140 --> 02:11:25.940
But the other four are all new. What a deal!

02:11:25.940 --> 02:11:29.940
Five bucks! Microsoft, get up off your ass, put this on the site. I want to download it.

02:11:29.940 --> 02:11:33.940
It's new! Damn it!

02:11:33.940 --> 02:11:37.940
What's wrong with you people?

02:11:37.940 --> 02:11:41.940
I'm just really upset about this.

02:11:41.940 --> 02:11:45.940
Maybe I have a little clip of the Kind Lady interlude, too. I was kind of hoping I would have one of those.

02:11:45.940 --> 02:11:49.940
I don't know, though. Maybe, uh...

02:11:49.940 --> 02:11:56.940
Well, I only have the... I have the Japanese v-rare at some point, but I think I moved it into a deep dark directory I'm not going to find any time soon.

02:11:57.940 --> 02:12:03.940
Um... yeah. Oh well, maybe another time. It's alright.

02:12:04.940 --> 02:12:09.940
I guess it's time for us to get into the FUs of the week?

02:12:11.940 --> 02:12:16.940
Sound good? We don't have to. I mean, we could just, you know, end the show.

02:12:16.940 --> 02:12:18.940
Promise?

02:12:18.940 --> 02:12:20.940
Alright, you guys can send your FUs of the Week

02:12:20.940 --> 02:12:22.940
over to Sky in the chatroom.

02:12:22.940 --> 02:12:26.560
Let's start it off. Here we go, FUs of the Week.

02:12:26.560 --> 02:12:28.560
Oh! I'm sorry.

02:12:28.560 --> 02:12:30.940
Jamie, why do we have to do the FUs every week?

02:12:30.940 --> 02:12:34.000
Uh...

02:12:35.640 --> 02:12:37.920
Very good. Now use your mouth.

02:12:37.920 --> 02:12:39.920
Fall with the bag.

02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:41.920
Here is justice.

02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:43.920
Here is punishment.

02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:45.920
Here is...

02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:51.920
Fuck you to my allergies, I hate them.

02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:54.920
And my cat for sleeping on my head.

02:12:54.920 --> 02:13:01.920
I hate my allergies, I'm on all kinds of drugs right now, they're not doing shit to make me feel better.

02:13:01.920 --> 02:13:06.920
Also, F you to sneezing messily in my car.

02:13:06.920 --> 02:13:09.920
And then to stupid drivers.

02:13:09.920 --> 02:13:14.920
And then to my Photoshop teacher, because Photoshop sucks, but he's an elitist.

02:13:14.920 --> 02:13:22.920
Um, F you to the seven goblins that followed my ass through the tomb in Final Fantasy 11.

02:13:22.920 --> 02:13:24.920
Now you're talking.

02:13:24.920 --> 02:13:27.920
Some paladin came by and owned all your asses.

02:13:27.920 --> 02:13:31.920
Because you suck.

02:13:31.920 --> 02:13:35.920
Um, F you to how slow leveling in that game is.

02:13:35.920 --> 02:13:43.800
But it is a very blessed thing that there's not so much of the Ragnarok style newbie talk, which really sucks a whole bunch of ass

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
F you to

02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:55.720
Not having any real concentration other situations that I can't really do anything about

02:13:55.720 --> 02:14:02.720
about. Um, F.U. to GameStop, just for the situation involving my fiance. Um, and, that's

02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:17.760
really it. Alright then, let's go over to our buddy, Loki, with his F.Us of the week.

02:14:17.760 --> 02:14:40.760
Fucking A, okay? First off, fucking Abit for creating a stupid motherboard with five different places to put RAM, and for confusing me for hours because I put the RAM in the wrong spot.

02:14:40.760 --> 02:14:52.000
spot don't and see also basically just um looking using my crazy sleep schedule

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:55.920
because I'm gonna be so tired tomorrow not that I really care because it'll be

02:14:55.920 --> 02:15:04.560
fun to be getting mad at Erica sleeping for my work and lucky to my goddamn case

02:15:04.560 --> 02:15:09.960
because I had to get another hard drive which I'm not even sure I need now just

02:15:09.960 --> 02:15:16.440
to get the stupid thing to work with power supply. So that sucks. And that's pretty much

02:15:16.440 --> 02:15:31.440
it. I had a pretty good week I think. Well then it's my turn. No they don't, they get

02:15:31.440 --> 02:15:39.680
worse. I'd like to give an F you to the government for getting one of my high school friends

02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:45.800
killed in Iraq. That kind of sucks. So, F you to the government. F you to Bush while

02:15:45.800 --> 02:15:50.880
I'm at it, because I don't like him. I never did. And, F you to the fact that I have to

02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:57.460
get up and go to work early tomorrow. That sucks. I don't like that. F you to me being

02:15:57.460 --> 02:16:01.520
lazy and not getting anything accomplished, but that's my own damn fault. F you to myself.

02:16:01.520 --> 02:16:03.480
and uh...

02:16:03.480 --> 02:16:05.480
at the end

02:16:05.480 --> 02:16:07.540
i've had a lot of it lately

02:16:07.540 --> 02:16:10.100
but i hide it really good on this show

02:16:10.100 --> 02:16:14.620
but secretly i'm plotting to kill each and every one of you

02:16:14.620 --> 02:16:16.260
thanks for the morning welcome

02:16:16.260 --> 02:16:20.300
let's see what the other folks in studio have to say starting with bug

02:16:20.300 --> 02:16:23.700
yes double F you to the government

02:16:23.700 --> 02:16:26.100
and uh... i've heard from various

02:16:26.100 --> 02:16:33.100
people that I haven't heard it from in ten years.

02:16:33.340 --> 02:16:40.340
Yeah, it was a very strange phone call today, because this person was very close to the stranger who died, and it was kind of strange.

02:16:45.840 --> 02:16:49.520
F-you the diesel prices, as always.

02:16:49.520 --> 02:16:53.700
Not F-you the running diesel prices.

02:16:53.700 --> 02:17:00.700
we still get way good miles to the gallon so shut up

02:17:00.840 --> 02:17:02.720
oh that sucked too

02:17:02.720 --> 02:17:06.720
We did a memorial last week, but that still sucks.

02:17:06.720 --> 02:17:07.720
I wasn't wrong.

02:17:07.720 --> 02:17:08.720
That's right.

02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:10.720
And, uh, let's do that.

02:17:10.720 --> 02:17:11.720
Pretty good deal.

02:17:11.720 --> 02:17:14.720
I need computer hard drives for my iMacs.

02:17:14.720 --> 02:17:18.720
I saved a laptop by pulling a hard drive out,

02:17:18.720 --> 02:17:22.720
moving files over for a UC Davis college student.

02:17:22.720 --> 02:17:23.720
Putting them on my elder iMac.

02:17:23.720 --> 02:17:25.720
I have the rules.

02:17:25.720 --> 02:17:26.720
She was happy.

02:17:26.720 --> 02:17:28.720
She had a computer that worked.

02:17:28.720 --> 02:17:33.720
Okay, now I get it.

02:17:33.720 --> 02:17:35.720
Yeah, yeah, there you go.

02:17:35.720 --> 02:17:37.720
I don't want to.

02:17:37.720 --> 02:17:38.720
Anything else?

02:17:38.720 --> 02:17:39.720
Uh, not really.

02:17:39.720 --> 02:17:40.720
Alright.

02:17:40.720 --> 02:17:41.720
Angel!

02:17:41.720 --> 02:17:48.720
A few to people who have a problem with me and won't come to me and come to my friends instead. That's all I have to say.

02:17:48.720 --> 02:17:50.720
Alright.

02:17:50.720 --> 02:17:52.720
And now we're going to get to the FUs from the chat room.

02:17:52.720 --> 02:17:56.200
from the chat room. However, before we get to the FUs from the chat room, I would like

02:17:56.200 --> 02:18:02.440
to offer a little bit of a reminder about the FUs of the Week segment here on this program.

02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:14.440
Let me get my reminder music up if I could do this here. Boys and girls, we do, we here

02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:20.160
at Orange Tons Radio do the FUs of the Week as a service to you and ourselves because

02:18:20.160 --> 02:18:24.680
we certainly get a load off of our chest. Now, luckily, we're a small program and nobody

02:18:24.680 --> 02:18:28.540
listens to us, so pretty much anybody who submits their FUs will get it read on the

02:18:28.540 --> 02:18:34.240
air. One day, we will be bigger than God, and we're not going to read your FUs anymore

02:18:34.240 --> 02:18:37.120
because we won't have the time. We'll have a little dark corner of the website where

02:18:37.120 --> 02:18:41.720
you can post them. But for now, we read your FUs on the air. However, there are some exceptions

02:18:41.720 --> 02:18:47.040
to this rule. We do not read FUs of a personal nature. In other words, if you're going to

02:18:47.040 --> 02:18:51.020
rant about somebody else, we're not gonna read that F.U on the air and of course there's

02:18:51.020 --> 02:18:55.180
an exception to every rule. If you're gonna rant about your teacher, we'll read that F.U

02:18:55.180 --> 02:19:00.860
because your teacher doesn't like you either, fine we'll read that F.U. F.Us to your parents,

02:19:00.860 --> 02:19:04.600
yeah everybody has F.Us about their parents once in a while. You know you love your parents

02:19:04.600 --> 02:19:09.220
but some days you wanna kill them. Guess what? They feel the same way about you. They love

02:19:09.220 --> 02:19:13.620
you most days but some days they wanna kill you. And wish you never been born. So we will

02:19:13.620 --> 02:19:17.900
allowed the FUs to teachers and parents and bosses. We all hate our boss. Actually, I

02:19:17.900 --> 02:19:22.220
love my boss. I'm very, I love my boss. I love people I work with. But I know a lot

02:19:22.220 --> 02:19:27.780
of you work in retail, so you don't. So that's fine. You can give an FU to your boss. Those

02:19:27.780 --> 02:19:33.080
types of FUs are fine. However, if you're going to give an FU to like an ex-boyfriend

02:19:33.080 --> 02:19:40.100
or an ex-girlfriend or an ex-best friend or an ex-what? Ex-wife. Well, some exceptions.

02:19:40.100 --> 02:19:46.120
I still let some exceptions even with that, but for the most part, if you want to give

02:19:46.120 --> 02:19:54.620
an F.U. about those types of things, let me give you a phone number, 1-800-96-GERRY.

02:19:54.620 --> 02:19:56.740
That is where you can go to handle your problems.

02:19:56.740 --> 02:19:59.420
Please do not send them care of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:19:59.420 --> 02:20:01.620
We don't want to get caught in the middle of your bullshit.

02:20:01.620 --> 02:20:03.980
Thank you.

02:20:03.980 --> 02:20:08.980
And now, the chat room FUs of the week.

02:20:08.980 --> 02:20:15.740
Ah, let's see, VX JasonXV says, F you to Tifa, that's all.

02:20:15.740 --> 02:20:19.580
Ry Chan says, oh Joyce first, she's sending Joyce's.

02:20:19.580 --> 02:20:23.460
Joyce says F you to sick demented fruit cakes that feel they can abuse animals and then

02:20:23.460 --> 02:20:28.980
don't even bother taking them to a shelter and leave them to fend for themselves.

02:20:28.980 --> 02:20:32.700

Lovely. Thank you guys for sharing your FUs with us.

02:22:12.400 --> 02:22:15.400
We feel you're angst.

02:22:15.400 --> 02:22:18.400
Oh, Jamie has another one. Let me get your song.

02:22:18.400 --> 02:22:20.400
No, you don't. Me too. Just to myself.

02:22:20.400 --> 02:22:26.760
Okay, why why but we love you Jamie

02:22:36.520 --> 02:22:38.520
When in doubt all right

02:22:41.260 --> 02:22:43.260
Here here

02:22:43.960 --> 02:22:45.960
Let's see a stalker I

02:22:45.960 --> 02:22:49.960
I think you have a couple in our chat room. I think I think Phoenix

02:22:49.960 --> 02:22:54.320
well Phoenix said he was a fanboy. I think he's more of a fanboy than a stalker.

02:22:54.320 --> 02:22:57.600
You want a stalker? I do just because

02:22:57.600 --> 02:23:01.320
it would be fun and interesting. Alright well. And then I could like

02:23:01.320 --> 02:23:08.320
hunt them down and kill them as revenge and then get on the news.

02:23:09.200 --> 02:23:13.720
Alright if you want to stalk Jamie send those emails to jamie at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:23:13.720 --> 02:23:19.720
And did you know it'll also work for Rob at orangeslauncherider.com or Loki at orangeslauncherider.com?

02:23:19.720 --> 02:23:26.720
Yeah, I agree. If anyone puts a personal F-you in again, we stick a Nevada-ton on them.

02:23:29.720 --> 02:23:31.720
She can go after them with a box cutter.

02:23:34.720 --> 02:23:37.720
Hey, did you know that the Dance Mania folks updated their website?

02:23:37.720 --> 02:23:41.720
Dance Mania, you know, being the series that DDR got a lot of its music from in Japan.

02:23:41.720 --> 02:23:50.240
Japan. They've got a new album coming out soon. It's Disco Viking. No, it's a lot of

02:23:50.240 --> 02:23:54.520
really interesting old songs. Listen to some of these songs that are on the CD. Call Me

02:23:54.520 --> 02:24:03.000
by Blondie, The Reflex by Duran Duran, David Bowie with Let's Dance, Sheena Easton with

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:08.740
Modern Girl, Heaven is a Place on Earth by Belinda Carlisle. A lot of these songs show

02:24:08.740 --> 02:24:13.420
up on a lot of DanceMania albums. Belinda Carlisle. An Upside Down by Cuckoo. Okay,

02:24:13.420 --> 02:24:20.980
that song is on like... Raichan is my official stalker now. Who is? Raichan. Cool. Never

02:24:20.980 --> 02:24:27.420
Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley. Oh, get this. Vacation by the Go-Go's. Love that song.

02:24:27.420 --> 02:24:32.380
Telephone Operator by Pete Shelley. I think that song's been in just about every other

02:24:32.380 --> 02:24:46.600
The

02:24:46.600 --> 02:24:55.040
Steve Miller band, Abracadabra.

02:24:55.040 --> 02:24:58.540
We gotta go to a break, cause Jamie's foaming at the mouth, she wants to get into the chat

02:24:58.540 --> 02:25:03.680
room, or she's gonna, she's gonna regulate, so we have to log out on the main screen so

02:25:03.680 --> 02:25:04.800
we can get her in.

02:25:04.800 --> 02:25:07.440
She wants to be cyber-stalked by those of you guys, so we gotta...

02:25:07.440 --> 02:25:11.000
Yes, apparently we're not doing a good enough job for her in person.

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:15.360
Alright, we're gonna play some Euromix songs in this break, because I wanna hear Video

02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:17.120
Kill the Radio Star.

02:25:17.120 --> 02:25:22.440
So we're gonna do some Euro- some varying Euromix tracks.

02:25:22.440 --> 02:25:28.100
then we'll be back. Oh, and Jamie wants to hear Kids in America, so I guess we can pull

02:25:28.100 --> 02:25:35.100
that song in there too. We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

02:25:58.100 --> 02:26:01.100
The video killed the radio star

02:26:01.100 --> 02:26:05.100
Pictures came and broke your heart

02:26:09.100 --> 02:26:12.100
And now we meet in an abandoned studio

02:26:12.100 --> 02:26:16.100
We hear the playback and it seems so long ago

02:26:16.100 --> 02:26:20.100
And you remember the jingles used to go

02:26:22.100 --> 02:26:24.100
You were the first one

02:26:25.100 --> 02:26:27.100
You were the last one

02:26:27.100 --> 02:26:34.100
Video killed the radio star

02:26:34.100 --> 02:26:38.100
In my mind and in my car

02:26:38.100 --> 02:26:42.100
We can't rewind, we've gone too far

02:27:12.100 --> 02:27:33.100
I sit here alone and I wonder why, Friday night and everyone, I can feel the heat but it's soothing, heading down, I search for the beat in this steady town.

02:27:33.100 --> 02:27:36.300
Steady down, down the yard with our growing

02:27:36.300 --> 02:27:39.300
Down, down the yard with our growing

02:27:39.300 --> 02:27:42.300
We're the kids in America

02:27:42.300 --> 02:27:45.300
We're the kids in America

02:27:45.300 --> 02:27:49.300
Everybody lives for the music around

02:28:45.300 --> 02:29:09.300
I thought that I was wounded, yeah Just after one of these days, yeah

02:29:09.300 --> 02:29:13.300
You didn't know what to do

02:29:13.300 --> 02:29:16.300
Then there was you

02:29:16.300 --> 02:29:20.300
And everything went so wrong tonight

02:29:20.300 --> 02:29:24.300
And the story might have been a concern

02:29:24.300 --> 02:29:27.300
And the music you were playing really blew my mind

02:29:27.300 --> 02:29:29.300
And the love

02:29:29.300 --> 02:29:31.300
It broke tight

02:29:31.300 --> 02:29:35.300
Cause baby when I

02:29:35.300 --> 02:29:40.300
When you fall in love for that I do

02:29:40.300 --> 02:29:46.300
We warm up to be a star

02:29:46.300 --> 02:29:50.300
We see and I see and I see

02:29:50.300 --> 02:29:55.300
When you fall in love for that I do

02:29:55.300 --> 02:30:04.300
We are one, we are one

02:30:25.300 --> 02:30:28.300
Do you feel the same?

02:30:38.300 --> 02:30:43.300
I want you to want me for all that I am

02:30:43.300 --> 02:30:47.300
And I'll never leave you behind

02:30:47.300 --> 02:30:54.300
I want you to be by my side, you're always on my mind

02:30:54.300 --> 02:31:02.300
Baby, am I the only reason to stop this game?

02:31:02.300 --> 02:31:06.300
Tell me, do you feel the same?

02:31:06.300 --> 02:31:10.300
I want you to want me for all that I am

02:31:10.300 --> 02:31:16.300
I hope that you will try to understand

02:31:16.300 --> 02:31:20.300
Do you feel the same?

02:31:20.300 --> 02:31:24.300
Do you feel the same?

02:31:24.300 --> 02:31:28.300
Or would you have warned me for all that I am?

02:31:28.300 --> 02:31:34.300
I hope that you will try to understand

02:31:34.300 --> 02:31:36.300
Do you feel the same?

02:31:36.300 --> 02:31:38.300
Do you feel the same?

02:31:38.300 --> 02:31:40.300
Do you feel the same?

02:31:40.300 --> 02:31:47.300
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and we want to get into some Ask Orange Lounge

But first, I want to give some plugs, we got a few plugs we want to give out.

02:32:39.560 --> 02:32:43.760
As we mentioned earlier in the show, the Orange Lounge Radio Podcast, it's a downloadable

02:32:43.760 --> 02:32:47.560
version of our show, about, what, 15-20 minutes?

02:32:47.560 --> 02:32:48.560
Very cool.

02:32:48.560 --> 02:32:50.560
No, you do not need an iPod to listen.

02:32:50.560 --> 02:32:55.440
It's developed for any type of MP3 player, including your computer.

02:32:55.440 --> 02:32:57.640
You can just listen to the show on your computer if you want.

02:32:57.640 --> 02:33:01.640
But the really cool thing is that if you happen to have some type of portable device, the

02:33:01.640 --> 02:33:05.120
show is really designed to be something that you listen to on the go.

02:33:05.120 --> 02:33:08.560

It's really awesome and normally I don't

02:33:42.020 --> 02:33:47.500

02:33:47.500 --> 02:33:51.140

02:35:28.860 --> 02:35:32.100
We're gonna go into ask orange lounge hey dark night

02:35:32.100 --> 02:35:37.460
Send me a private message with more information on what you're saying in chat room. I'm too lazy to type right now. This is great

02:35:37.460 --> 02:35:39.460
I'm just gonna talk to the chat room

02:35:40.100 --> 02:35:42.100
tonight

02:35:42.100 --> 02:35:50.580
Alright, forget it. But Dark Knight, send me a private message with a link to more information

02:35:50.580 --> 02:35:57.400
and I will do so. Alright, let's get into Ask Orange Lounge. This is your opportunity

02:35:57.400 --> 02:36:11.580
to ask us some stuff. Let's Ask Orange Lounge. Some stupid question. What will we find out

02:36:11.580 --> 02:36:18.340
this week on Orange Lounge Radio. Will we find a cure to Jamie's allergies or will we

02:36:18.340 --> 02:36:31.340
find a cure for Matt's big angst? There's no cure, no cure. Question number one from

02:36:31.340 --> 02:36:41.540
BRP Ohio Bamani. The podcast has potential for much more. Are you guys considering any

02:36:41.540 --> 02:36:47.020
podcast-only segments? The easy answer I have to that is yes.

02:36:47.020 --> 02:36:51.340
We already have a podcast-only segment. Yeah, we do have some podcast-only segments.

02:36:51.340 --> 02:36:56.260
We have Dark Sakura's advice column, which is a podcast-only segment. We're hoping to

02:36:56.260 --> 02:37:01.740
have more segments in the future. It's still in its infancy. I mean, what, tonight we're

02:37:01.740 --> 02:37:07.000
going to do episode number five, I think? Episode five or six of the program? The show

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:13.080
was still in his infancy. This show sucked when it first started too. Remember, the cage

02:37:13.080 --> 02:37:16.880
match didn't show up until episode 20, and some of the segments, you know, it didn't

02:37:16.880 --> 02:37:20.840
show up until later on. And now we whore them out. I mean, if we didn't have these segments,

02:37:20.840 --> 02:37:25.340
we wouldn't have a show. The podcast would do the same thing. The other cool thing about

02:37:25.340 --> 02:37:32.140
the podcast is that it's very flexible, is that we could, if we wanted to, if we were

02:37:32.140 --> 02:37:36.820
on the road somewhere, Loki's trying to build us an on the road computer that's

02:37:36.820 --> 02:37:39.900
going to be inside an Xbox. In fact, if you look on cam, you can kind of see

02:37:39.900 --> 02:37:43.660
Loki's head. That's what he's working on right now. He's working on the Xbox PC. We

02:37:43.660 --> 02:37:47.800
have a plan that this year from E3, we're going to be giving you updates via the

02:37:47.800 --> 02:37:53.580
podcast every day on what we've seen at E3. Honestly, if you were to watch this

02:37:53.580 --> 02:37:58.380
coverage on television on one of the tech stations on TV, you'd be waiting a

02:37:58.380 --> 02:38:02.440
a couple weeks to a month to be seeing these sorts of updates. If you were to be reading

02:38:02.440 --> 02:38:06.180
about it in a magazine, you'd be waiting like six to eight weeks to see this stuff. Even

02:38:06.180 --> 02:38:14.860
other websites take a couple days sometimes. We will have live audio from E3 the same damn

02:38:14.860 --> 02:38:19.240
day. It's going to rock. That's the kind of cool stuff the podcast is going to present.

02:38:19.240 --> 02:38:24.440
That's what we're planning to do. So, all those sorts of things. So thank you very much.

02:38:24.440 --> 02:38:32.880
hugs and kisses. Alright. Let's get to some more questions here. What else do you guys

02:38:32.880 --> 02:38:40.320
think could be done with the podcast? Anything you guys want to add to that?

02:38:40.320 --> 02:38:45.960
We could even do other podcasts for some of our spin-off shows.

02:38:45.960 --> 02:38:50.960
Yeah, we do have that ability, honestly. So, we shall see.

02:38:50.960 --> 02:38:55.960
Alright.

02:38:55.960 --> 02:39:00.960
Dead air, dead air. Sorry, I'm posting a link in our chat room right now

02:39:00.960 --> 02:39:05.960
on how folks can help pour us up.

02:39:05.960 --> 02:39:10.960
I can make the grudge sound again.

02:39:10.960 --> 02:39:11.960
That's fun.

02:39:11.960 --> 02:39:12.960
What?

02:39:12.960 --> 02:39:13.960
This is really creepy.

02:39:13.960 --> 02:39:15.480
I said I just took apart a laptop battery.

02:39:15.480 --> 02:39:16.480
That's fun.

02:39:16.480 --> 02:39:17.480
Fun.

02:39:17.480 --> 02:39:18.480
What's inside?

02:39:18.480 --> 02:39:19.480
Batteries.

02:39:19.480 --> 02:39:23.080
Scary stuff that could hurt me.

02:39:23.080 --> 02:39:24.960
Legend of Zaku has a question.

02:39:24.960 --> 02:39:32.160
What licensed songs would you like to see on an American 2DX mix, if it happens?

02:39:32.160 --> 02:39:35.480
Any requests for an im- Shaft.

02:39:35.480 --> 02:39:36.840
The theme from Shaft.

02:39:36.840 --> 02:39:38.840
Jamie says Temple of Butt.

02:39:38.840 --> 02:39:40.200
She's yelling from the laundry room.

02:39:40.200 --> 02:39:44.640
Angel, anything you want to say?

02:39:44.640 --> 02:39:46.760
I don't know, all of a sudden I

02:39:46.760 --> 02:39:50.080
thought of the BT song from

02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:53.640
Extreme. I don't know why, I just kind of thought of it, I don't know.

02:39:53.640 --> 02:39:55.000
Simply being loved.

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:58.180
Yeah, I was going to say that, but I don't know.

02:39:58.180 --> 02:40:02.240
Either that or just something different, I don't know.

02:40:02.240 --> 02:40:06.920
Dude, Skulk would be actually kind of fun to play. Oh my god, yes.

02:40:06.920 --> 02:40:15.280
any echo image. Just honestly, team up with a different drum. Let Konami Hawaii do it.

02:40:15.280 --> 02:40:21.280
And team up with a different drum. Because that would be so hot. So that and what other

02:40:21.280 --> 02:40:26.160
songs would be good? Actually a lot of the crossovers they've had in DDR might be fun

02:40:26.160 --> 02:40:31.000
like Dirty Vegas would be kind of cute. What else would be fun? I'm trying to think of

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:35.480
songs that haven't really been in DDR yet. Or 2DX. Actually, you know what, even though

02:40:35.480 --> 02:40:39.840
the song's already been in 2DX, and it's a really horrid song, I really want to see it

02:40:39.840 --> 02:40:52.180
in 2DX USA, Deadline. I love Deadline. Love it. Honestly, just go to like Robin's Entertainment

02:40:52.180 --> 02:40:58.360
and just put anything from those dance compilations. Just give us some Lasko, some Ian Vandal,

02:40:58.360 --> 02:41:03.620
I don't care. All that stuff would be cool. I want that Come Into My Dream song by Froggy.

02:41:03.620 --> 02:41:08.580
come into my address, because that has a really cool beat to it, so. Ooh, definitely, do that.

02:41:08.580 --> 02:41:18.740
Do that. All right, let's see. Illusion has a question. Illusion wants to know, okay,

02:41:18.740 --> 02:41:23.260
he's done a lot of soul searching here, and he's wanted to ask this question for the longest

02:41:23.260 --> 02:41:29.540
time. Weeks have gone by, sleepless nights because I couldn't ask this question, he says.

02:41:29.540 --> 02:41:34.540
Here is his question. Is Jem truly outrageous?

02:41:34.540 --> 02:41:37.540
Truly, truly outrageous.

02:41:37.540 --> 02:41:43.540
Jem is adventure. Jem is excitement. Jem is lame. Jem is not lame!

02:41:43.540 --> 02:41:46.540
She is not, but the dolls have really huge heads.

02:41:46.540 --> 02:41:51.540
But the Misfits? Their songs are better. And they're gonna get her.

02:41:51.540 --> 02:41:56.540
It was all about later in the series when Jetta showed up and played that black saxophone.

02:41:56.540 --> 02:42:03.540
phone. I was like, my hero forever.

02:42:26.540 --> 02:42:31.540
They got other songs. But one of the songs they do is so cool. You've got to hear this.

02:42:31.540 --> 02:42:36.540
I've got to find the directory it's in though. My computer is a big fat mess right now.

02:42:36.540 --> 02:42:42.540
It is actually a cover. You're not going to believe this. It's a cover of the Gem theme song.

02:42:42.540 --> 02:42:44.540
That is awesome. Play it.

02:42:44.540 --> 02:42:48.120
I'm gonna play a little clip of it. Okay, I'm only gonna play like the first verse.

02:42:48.120 --> 02:42:50.120
Here it is.

02:43:18.120 --> 02:43:20.560
Truly truly truly outraging

02:43:20.560 --> 02:43:40.460
Whoa, tramp

02:43:46.400 --> 02:43:47.480
Come on

02:43:47.480 --> 02:43:49.720
They're the misfits, they're gonna get her.

02:43:49.720 --> 02:43:51.360
Isn't that cool?

02:43:51.360 --> 02:43:53.720
Yeah, I have to tell a little story about Freeze Pop.

02:43:53.720 --> 02:43:55.040
Alright, tell a story about Freeze Pop.

02:43:55.040 --> 02:43:59.060
Freeze Pop is from Boston. I have a bunch of friends in Boston.

02:43:59.060 --> 02:44:00.280
They were...

02:44:00.280 --> 02:44:02.520
My friends were at a club, and

02:44:02.520 --> 02:44:05.000
this guy was going off about how he hates

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.700
and hates Freeze Pop because they sound so fake.

02:44:07.700 --> 02:44:11.960
Meanwhile, the lead singer of Freeze Pop was standing behind him, just fuming.

02:44:11.960 --> 02:44:14.600
Yeah.

02:44:14.600 --> 02:44:16.760
And apparently she could really kick ass.

02:44:16.760 --> 02:44:20.180
Did she I don't believe so freeze-pop is so awesome

02:44:20.180 --> 02:44:25.900
It was pointed out that the elite singer that he really hates the sound of was standing right behind him and he I guess he left

02:44:27.020 --> 02:44:31.480
Much to his own behest. Oh my god. We need to get freeze-pop on this show. I

02:44:33.540 --> 02:44:38.880
Doubt that's even possible, but I would try to stick around Boston. No, I don't have to be here

02:44:38.880 --> 02:44:40.880
We get we do have the phone thing

02:44:40.880 --> 02:44:45.880
Yeah, see? We got Midihead on this show, dammit! Anything's possible.

02:44:45.880 --> 02:44:47.880
I'll see what my contacts can do.

02:44:47.880 --> 02:44:54.880
Ooh! Have your, yeah, have your people talk to their people, and then have their people contact my people. And we'll have a people party.

02:44:54.880 --> 02:44:57.880
Yay people party. Or did you get the ender before?

02:44:57.880 --> 02:45:00.880
Awesome. All the time. Non-stop.

02:45:00.880 --> 02:45:04.880
DarkSakura, I know you're a big Gem fan, and a FreezePop fan, what'd you think of that?

02:45:04.880 --> 02:45:05.880
That was pretty neat.

02:45:05.880 --> 02:45:08.880
I love the Misfits part. That's like the best part of this song.

02:45:08.880 --> 02:45:11.880
We are the Misfits. Our songs are better.

02:45:11.880 --> 02:45:14.880
Have you heard this song? Okay, you know what?

02:45:14.880 --> 02:45:17.880
I don't care. I'm going to play another little clip of a Freezepop song.

02:45:17.880 --> 02:45:19.880
I don't care that we're kind of off on a tangent right now.

02:45:19.880 --> 02:45:21.880
It's our show. We can do whatever we want.

02:45:21.880 --> 02:45:25.880
But you have to hear this song because they talk about video games in it.

02:45:25.880 --> 02:45:27.880
I'm only going to play a little clip of it.

02:45:27.880 --> 02:45:31.880
But you have to listen because in the beginning they sample a Speak and Spell.

02:45:31.880 --> 02:45:33.880
It is so awesome. Listen to this.

02:45:33.880 --> 02:45:40.880
and it spells out freeze poop. Listen, listen, I'm not even kidding, it's awesome.

02:45:40.880 --> 02:45:48.880
F-R-E-E-Z-E-P-O-O-P.

02:45:48.880 --> 02:45:57.880
Wrong, try again. F-R-E-E-Z-E-P-O-P.

02:45:57.880 --> 02:45:59.880
You are correct.

02:46:27.880 --> 02:46:45.600
I don't have new headbands Asteroids are Donkey Kong

02:46:45.600 --> 02:46:49.920
Don't look here for Tetris Even Super Wario

02:46:49.920 --> 02:46:54.480
Don't ask me I told you though Don't play with me

02:46:54.480 --> 02:47:00.480
I am not your choice. Oh, can't you see? I am the perfect one.

02:47:00.480 --> 02:47:04.680
tell me that song is not cool pretty cool

02:47:04.680 --> 02:47:09.500
I'm gonna play that song in its entirety later just you wait alright enough

02:47:09.500 --> 02:47:13.180
freeze pop thank you illusion for sending me all those songs is awesome

02:47:13.180 --> 02:47:20.820
let's see uh moving on right Chan and Joyce are sending this question will

02:47:20.820 --> 02:47:26.860
orange lounge radio ever get a studio pet if they make ferrets legal you guys

02:47:26.860 --> 02:47:32.860
I was going to say, I thought the ferrets were the pets. I was wondering where they disappeared to.

02:47:32.860 --> 02:47:38.860
We haven't had the ferrets in the show in a long time. I think the ferrets got buried under crap.

02:47:38.860 --> 02:47:42.860
I don't know where the ferrets are. They're around somewhere. Look around. They're somewhere.

02:47:42.860 --> 02:47:46.860
There might be some next to your chair. Don't you usually have them during the show?

02:47:46.860 --> 02:47:49.860
If I bend over, my nose is going to start draining again.

02:47:49.860 --> 02:47:57.100
We got the ferrets around somewhere. Basically, the reason why we don't have an actual pet

02:47:57.100 --> 02:48:01.420
is that, I don't know about Loki, but I am far too irresponsible to have a pet. I will

02:48:01.420 --> 02:48:05.580
kill it. I'm the type of person that will come home and say, oh shit, I forgot to feed

02:48:05.580 --> 02:48:06.580
a cat this week.

02:48:06.580 --> 02:48:10.380
It's not about caring for the pet. It's about the $500 deposit for the pet.

02:48:10.380 --> 02:48:11.380
Oh yeah, that's part of it too.

02:48:11.380 --> 02:48:12.380
Fuck that.

02:48:12.380 --> 02:48:13.380
Yeah.

02:48:13.380 --> 02:48:16.700
There's a lot I could do with $500. Like piss it away on some computer that I won't use.

02:48:16.700 --> 02:48:21.140
exactly so um... you know i just don't have the desire to get a pet

02:48:21.140 --> 02:48:23.380
uh... as far as ferret and besides

02:48:23.380 --> 02:48:25.020
besides like um...

02:48:25.020 --> 02:48:26.360
brp said

02:48:26.360 --> 02:48:29.900
they already have a studio pet, his name is loki

02:48:29.900 --> 02:48:33.700
and ferrets actually smell very bad even if you do that

02:48:33.700 --> 02:48:35.780
i want a penthouse pet

02:48:35.780 --> 02:48:39.000
ferrets are mean little shits too seriously

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:42.440
ferrets are evil because they bite things and they bite

02:48:42.440 --> 02:48:43.540
through your finger

02:48:43.540 --> 02:48:45.040
Only if you raise them wrong.

02:48:45.040 --> 02:48:49.580
And at night, and after midnight, if you feed it, they turn into rabid little creatures

02:48:49.580 --> 02:48:50.580
and...

02:48:50.580 --> 02:48:51.580
Dude, no.

02:48:51.580 --> 02:48:52.580
So is Loki.

02:48:52.580 --> 02:48:53.580
Why do you keep him around?

02:48:53.580 --> 02:48:54.580
Because he actually pays rent.

02:48:54.580 --> 02:48:55.580
But that's funny.

02:48:55.580 --> 02:48:57.980
We can tape him and put him on the internet, yeah, and he pays rent.

02:48:57.980 --> 02:49:00.060
Would a ferret go out and get a job and pay rent?

02:49:00.060 --> 02:49:01.060
I don't think so.

02:49:01.060 --> 02:49:03.060
My friend's ferrets were cool.

02:49:03.060 --> 02:49:07.460
He named them Koto and Poto and then he was going to give them to me before I moved out

02:49:07.460 --> 02:49:08.460
here.

02:49:08.460 --> 02:49:11.500
And then I found out that I couldn't have ferrets out here.

02:49:11.500 --> 02:49:17.620
I would just like to add that Joyce is saying Joyce has a pair of really sweet ferrets, and she says ferrets

02:49:17.620 --> 02:49:20.320
You don't because they are like a large hamster

02:49:21.060 --> 02:49:23.540
Well, they're like a really small cat mixed with a hamster

02:49:25.300 --> 02:49:31.140
Just what I need a giant hamster think of all the gay jokes I'd hear of with that one

02:49:31.820 --> 02:49:33.820
What'd you sit on exactly?

02:49:33.820 --> 02:49:46.820
I'm getting told by Joyce. Don't get me started. I know how to take care of ferrets. Do not underestimate ferrets.

02:49:46.820 --> 02:49:55.820
They're illegal in California. California says no to ferrets. They will terminate the ferrets.

02:49:55.820 --> 02:50:01.820
That's got to be one of the worst Arnold impressions.

02:50:01.820 --> 02:50:09.260
paid to impersonate Arnold yeah what about what about that can't hear you put

02:50:09.260 --> 02:50:14.700
the microphone next to your mouth we can actually hear you did you see much that

02:50:14.700 --> 02:50:20.580
movie that they're doing about the governor no what about it it has this

02:50:20.580 --> 02:50:25.340
old guy that doesn't look or sound like Arnold but it's supposed to be him it

02:50:25.340 --> 02:50:27.340
It sucks.

02:50:31.340 --> 02:50:32.340
That is all.

02:50:32.340 --> 02:50:34.340
So that would be like me playing Arnold.

02:50:34.340 --> 02:50:35.340
Yes.

02:50:35.340 --> 02:50:37.340
California!

02:50:40.340 --> 02:50:41.340
I crack me up.

02:50:42.340 --> 02:50:43.340
Alright.

02:50:47.340 --> 02:50:49.340
You crack you up or you're on crack?

02:50:49.340 --> 02:50:50.340
Both.

02:50:50.340 --> 02:50:51.340
Difference?

02:50:52.340 --> 02:50:53.340
Let's see.

02:50:53.340 --> 02:50:58.180
Dark Knight is sending a question, hey, quick question thinking about the Capcom and Namco

02:50:58.180 --> 02:50:59.180
thing.

02:50:59.180 --> 02:51:02.360
This was posted to our website, they're doing a Capcom cross Namco game, it's going to be

02:51:02.360 --> 02:51:04.660
like an RPG featuring both characters.

02:51:04.660 --> 02:51:10.580
I was wondering if Namco and Sega will finally do a Tekken vs Virtua Fighter game for real.

02:51:10.580 --> 02:51:13.660
God I hope not because I hate Virtua Fighter.

02:51:13.660 --> 02:51:20.680
Honestly we are really not the people to be asking on that subject.

02:51:20.680 --> 02:51:22.980
Write letters, show love, maybe it'll happen.

02:51:22.980 --> 02:51:26.980
I just want Tekken 5 to be out now.

02:51:26.980 --> 02:51:27.980
On console?

02:51:27.980 --> 02:51:28.980
Yes.

02:51:28.980 --> 02:51:29.980
That'd be pretty hot.

02:51:29.980 --> 02:51:34.980
Dan's saving a Tekken 5 poster for me to go in my cubicle.

02:51:34.980 --> 02:51:37.980
When is that supposed to come out? Do we have a release?

02:51:37.980 --> 02:51:38.980
I don't know.

02:51:38.980 --> 02:51:40.980
Not right now.

02:51:40.980 --> 02:51:45.980
I honestly don't know. That would be neat. Crossover games can be neat, but we don't know.

02:51:45.980 --> 02:51:48.980
Here's a question maybe we can help with.

02:51:48.980 --> 02:52:07.980
Let's see. Darkknight says, another question I need your help on. Choosing an anime character to dress up as when I go to a local convention in June. Should I dress up as a character from B-Blade, or land from Mega Man and T-Series?

02:52:07.980 --> 02:52:10.980
Go with the second one.

02:52:10.980 --> 02:52:14.980
I think you should dress up as a milkmaid.

02:52:14.980 --> 02:52:15.980
Super milk child?

02:52:15.980 --> 02:52:21.620
Yes. Go as Ranma because it's one of the only animes I've actually seen.

02:52:21.620 --> 02:52:25.860
Okay. Ranma cosplay

02:52:25.860 --> 02:52:30.860
should have been buried five years ago. What about Sailor Menshi?

02:52:30.860 --> 02:52:36.700
That really killed everyone right there.

02:52:36.700 --> 02:52:41.260
The last AX I went to though had an Utena cosplayer

02:52:41.260 --> 02:52:44.620
who went as Utena in the boys uniform.

02:52:44.620 --> 02:52:53.140
and it was a guy cosplaying her who looked very female but it was it was

02:52:53.140 --> 02:52:56.520
really good cosplay and then he went around later in the the girl style with

02:52:56.520 --> 02:53:01.740
the shorts and everything and then there was the Umi cosplayer who was a guy at

02:53:01.740 --> 02:53:05.820
Fana Mae 2001

02:53:06.820 --> 02:53:13.460
what's it the mob ass I don't know what I didn't I don't even know how to

02:53:13.460 --> 02:53:21.020
to pronounce that. It's Dumubas. No, it's Dumas. Mr. Dumas. I love it when people make

02:53:21.020 --> 02:53:27.940
typos and everybody jumps on them. Haha, you said Dumubas. Let's start internet trend now.

02:53:27.940 --> 02:53:35.180
Whenever you say dumbass or type dumbass, always spell it like that. Dumubas. Just like

02:53:35.180 --> 02:53:44.440
pwned you heard it here first to move ass to move ass shut up you do move ass

02:53:44.440 --> 02:53:52.760
all right let's see Joyce wanted to clarify a few things about the pet

02:53:52.760 --> 02:54:00.320
ferret they're tasty she's getting that is not what she's saying you sure as I'm

02:54:00.320 --> 02:54:07.080
sure. It became illegal because of wrong scientific information in the 1930s that they are wild

02:54:07.080 --> 02:54:11.980
animals and non-domesticated. They've been domesticated for so long that they couldn't

02:54:11.980 --> 02:54:18.380
survive in the wild. The AFA is working on getting them legalized in California. But

02:54:18.380 --> 02:54:23.580
in the meantime, you know what? I don't want to go to jail over a ferret. You know, I don't

02:54:23.580 --> 02:54:28.100
want to be sitting next to Bubba. You're just going to slap a fine on you. What are you

02:54:28.100 --> 02:54:34.320
here for? You know, I asked Bubba, Bubba, what are you in here for? I'm in here for

02:54:34.320 --> 02:54:41.100
committing murder. I murdered a guy over drugs. What are you in here for, gay boy? I owned

02:54:41.100 --> 02:54:46.000
a ferret. Okay, you're not going to go to jail for owning a ferret, but that would be

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:52.500
funny. That would be a great sitcom. Another big guy. I'm in here for ripping the tag off

02:54:52.500 --> 02:54:59.500
a pillow. It's another episode of Bubba and the Gay. Oh my god, this ferret was like tearing

02:55:04.420 --> 02:55:11.180
apart my curtains. I was so mad. I just had an image of like a little Korean lady in the

02:55:11.180 --> 02:55:18.180
background going, are you the gay? Are you the gay? The Korean lady can be like the warden.

02:55:18.180 --> 02:55:22.540
I think it would be very funny to put

02:55:22.540 --> 02:55:26.700
gay man and Bubba in the same cell. What is that accent? I don't even know what I'm doing.

02:55:26.700 --> 02:55:32.700
Forget it. Korean Italian?

02:55:32.700 --> 02:55:34.100
Really spicy spaghetti I guess?

02:55:34.100 --> 02:55:38.900
Ry Chan says Bubba might like me though.

02:55:38.900 --> 02:55:43.380
You got a purty mouth.

02:55:43.380 --> 02:55:47.420
My ferret had a purty mouth.

02:55:47.420 --> 02:55:50.260
Jaded2005 has a question.

02:55:50.260 --> 02:55:53.580
Why doesn't someone change the webcam

02:55:53.580 --> 02:55:57.220
so people don't look at the couch the whole time?

02:55:57.220 --> 02:56:00.260
You need to come here more often.

02:56:00.260 --> 02:56:04.820
Yes, yes I know. So people, let me finish the question. Why doesn't someone change the

02:56:04.820 --> 02:56:07.980
webcam so people don't look at the couch the whole time?

02:56:07.980 --> 02:56:12.380
Because it's not going to be pointed at me. Yeah, we have a ban.

02:56:12.380 --> 02:56:17.380
Alright, I'll get on the fucking cam.

02:56:17.380 --> 02:56:30.380
Alright, Jamie's inching her way towards the cam so that you can see something new.

02:56:30.380 --> 02:56:33.380
Uh, basically, what are you doing?

02:56:34.380 --> 02:56:37.380
Jamie's made her way to the c- okay, Jamie's on the cam right now, a little piece of-

02:56:37.380 --> 02:56:38.380
JAMIE!

02:56:38.380 --> 02:56:40.380
A little piece of Jamie, for you guys, on the cam.

02:56:43.380 --> 02:56:51.380
Basically, the way the cam is set up, it's actually inside that massive arcade cabinet that Loki has set up,

02:56:51.380 --> 02:56:56.380
and it's a real bitch to take the iToy out of it and put it somewhere else.

02:56:56.380 --> 02:57:01.340
else. Now, there have been previous episodes. There was an episode not that long ago where

02:57:01.340 --> 02:57:03.620
we actually had the IToyCam pointed over this way.

02:57:03.620 --> 02:57:09.820
Well, it's not really that much of a bitch to take it. Okay. Yes, it's a huge bitch to

02:57:09.820 --> 02:57:13.200
take out of the cabinet. Oh my God, the-

02:57:13.200 --> 02:57:14.700
Painted in mumbass.

02:57:14.700 --> 02:57:23.120
Yeah, exactly. What? Yes. Painted in mumbass. We're gonna make this catch on. You're gonna

02:57:23.120 --> 02:57:24.900
like it. It's just like Death Cake.

02:57:24.900 --> 02:57:31.460
The chat room has a request for you to do your grudge face on cam.

02:57:31.460 --> 02:57:32.460
She's gonna do it.

02:57:32.460 --> 02:57:33.460
I don't have a grudge face.

02:57:33.460 --> 02:57:39.220
It's just me with my mouth open.

02:57:39.220 --> 02:57:40.220
Think fish.

02:57:40.220 --> 02:57:41.220
No.

02:57:41.220 --> 02:57:47.060
All right, illusion as a question.

02:57:47.060 --> 02:57:50.500
Since you've got ten minutes of no questions, I suppose I'll ask another.

02:57:50.500 --> 02:57:51.500
Hey.

02:57:51.500 --> 02:57:54.420
What's your favorite freeze pop song?

02:57:54.420 --> 02:57:59.260
Obviously I'm having an orgasm over them recently.

02:57:59.260 --> 02:58:01.420
Science Genius Girl remix.

02:58:01.420 --> 02:58:03.020
The live one.

02:58:03.020 --> 02:58:09.020
Dude, you know what Science Genius Girl remix rocks?

02:58:09.020 --> 02:58:12.460
No, Loki, none of them is not the correct answer.

02:58:12.460 --> 02:58:15.580
We're gonna kick you in the demub ass now.

02:58:15.580 --> 02:58:18.500
Don't be such a demub ass.

02:58:18.500 --> 02:58:21.700
It's the Science Genius Girl mix that sounds like it was done on a Game Boy.

02:58:21.700 --> 02:58:23.700
Oh boy, listen to this, it's so cool.

02:58:23.700 --> 02:58:53.140
One times two times three

02:58:53.140 --> 02:58:56.140
When I clone a human being

02:59:23.140 --> 02:59:25.140
Oh, boy, oh, boy.

02:59:28.140 --> 02:59:35.140
Yeah, think about it this way, Dark Knight. You are on the cutting edge of a new internet trend.

02:59:41.140 --> 02:59:47.140
My favorite, my favorite, uh, freeze-pop song for the record would be the, um, um...

02:59:47.140 --> 02:59:50.140
Oh, God, I forgot the, I forgot the name of it.

02:59:50.140 --> 02:59:52.140
What a fan I am.

02:59:52.140 --> 03:00:00.140
shit meanwhile listen to Jamie just choke over there or whatever she's doing

03:00:00.140 --> 03:00:04.940
what's this about stakeout that's the name of the song stakeouts my favorite

03:00:04.940 --> 03:00:15.260
free swap song all right let's see I think we're about wrapping up the show

03:00:15.260 --> 03:00:19.420
we're pretty much done boys and girls but we have to get everybody's final

03:00:19.420 --> 03:00:28.260
thought before this show can be over. Bug, your final thought. Angel, your final thought.

03:00:28.260 --> 03:00:45.060
Online games are addicting. Dark Sacra. Loki, your final thought. My final thought is I

03:00:45.060 --> 03:00:48.420
I made a mess and didn't do anything.

03:00:48.420 --> 03:00:52.700
Now I'm back to square one. You made a mess, now clean it up. I did clean it up, that's what I'm doing right now.

03:00:52.700 --> 03:00:56.160
But uh...

03:00:56.160 --> 03:00:57.200
I hate this stupid thing.

03:00:57.200 --> 03:01:02.620
You know what? I could have bought a laptop for the money. I built this damn thing and it would have been more powerful too.

03:01:02.620 --> 03:01:03.540
Probably.

03:01:03.540 --> 03:01:05.920
Go fake. But not as leet.

03:01:05.920 --> 03:01:07.860
I guess, whatever.

03:01:07.860 --> 03:01:09.820
Um, let's see.

03:01:09.820 --> 03:01:12.600
Um...

03:01:12.600 --> 03:01:22.600
And then, um, my final thought would be, um, 1-800-96-JERRY. That's my final thought.

03:01:22.600 --> 03:01:27.380
The final word of tonight's show, bugged, I'm gonna give it to you, buddy. One word

03:01:27.380 --> 03:01:32.620
to sum it all up, this show. What is it, my friend? See you next week, guys.

03:01:32.620 --> 03:01:35.300
DUMB-UM-ASS.

03:01:35.300 --> 03:01:40.600

Alright guys, we're gonna go back to our Bomani Music and More program, featuring all your favorite DDR2DX and DanceMania favorites.

03:03:12.220 --> 03:03:16.720
Did you know our show is being bootlegged? I just found a bootleg site.

03:03:16.720 --> 03:03:21.720
Somebody's posting episodes of this show up on a bootleg page. We should sue them.

03:03:21.720 --> 03:03:25.720
We're gonna sue! No, I'm just kidding, we're not gonna sue. That's kinda cool.

03:03:25.720 --> 03:03:28.720
Orange House Radio's being bootlegged, that's so cool.

03:03:28.720 --> 03:03:33.220
I didn't do it. I am innocent. Thank you.

03:03:33.220 --> 03:03:36.500
I know you didn't do it. I know who did it! They signed their name on the page!

03:03:36.500 --> 03:03:40.580
I know damn well who did it! That's alright.

03:03:40.580 --> 03:03:44.540
We think it's cute. That's my official word on the matter, it's cute.

03:03:44.540 --> 03:03:48.380
Alright, have a good one you guys, we'll see you next time.
