341142	343804	We are live!
344824	346445	And this is episode number 126 for this
349651	352152	January the 9th of 2005.
352713	359877	You're tuned into the B... Money Scenes.
360877	362878	Most minty station of all things money.
363939	365099	My name is Rob Roberts.
365139	366680	You might know me as Sky.
367521	369782	Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts.
369962	371823	In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm.
371923	373644	Say hello to DarkSakura.
373664	375325	You know her maybe as Jamie Summers.
376385	376786	I like fire.
378550	379751	Fire is very cool.
379811	380432	I do like fire.
380512	382694	I watched Mr. Show today.
383834	386216	What have you set on fire this week, Jamie?
386257	386977	Just out of curiosity.
386997	387417	Candles.
387898	388138	Oh, okay.
388378	389399	They smelled like pears.
389519	390140	That's something.
391501	393282	I played Sunday Money this week.
393643	396845	Oh, we're going to get into that definitely when we get into How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.
396986	398227	You should light a pear on fire.
398267	399047	I wonder what that would do.
400048	403791	It wouldn't catch fire because of the moisture in the pear.
404512	405753	You catch the stem on fire, maybe.
406283	411206	Well, if you threw it in the fireplace, that might be like a lot of fire where the moisture would put it out.
411266	413467	But not enough.
413528	419951	It would still... Seriously?
421132	422693	I'm full of good ideas here.
422733	425455	Okay, we're going to have roasted pears with butter and cinnamon.
426275	427256	Stay on Iron Chef.
427276	427876	We're a battle.
427916	428577	I'm a genius.
429677	433580	Also joining us, the other co-host, you know him...
434485	437426	The angry, the bitter, the tech massa, Loki!
439627	439827	Alright.
443368	447270	And we never say his stage name, but it's Matt Blackman, by the way.
447630	448670	Just in case you were curious.
448730	449010	Alright.
450811	453232	Also joining us tonight, we have one special guest.
453632	456993	Well, actually we have two, but one of them never talks, so we just don't acknowledge her.
458170	458590	DDRAngel
486363	486663	Hello.
486964	487104	Ah.
489566	490927	I almost killed myself with the cord.
491147	491268	Ah!
491928	495712	Those that know her pretty well, though, know that she's actually DDR Devil.
496993	497934	Bastard, I am not.
500476	501057	Oh, great.
501617	504079	There's the devil right there in ferret form.
504820	505921	So, do I have a name yet?
508483	508864	Do you?
509024	509364	I don't know.
509424	510045	Do you have a name?
511963	512384	Tell me.
512484	513186	Just Angel.
513526	514428	Okay, it's just Angel.
514468	514729	Fine.
515089	515971	I don't have a label anymore.
516011	516973	Angel of the morning.
517133	518376	I like Angel Devilman.
520340	521141	Or Deviled Angel.
521181	523285	I like those paradoxes.
523345	523546	Anyway.
524600	528944	Alright, we got a fun show for you tonight.
529024	529724	Actually, we don't.
529744	532446	We have a mediocre show, but it's packaged as a good show.
532527	535509	No, it's going to be a good show as always.
536169	537230	Lots of things to talk about.
537871	543115	As Jamie mentioned there, she's actually played some Bomani this week, so we got to talk about that, among other Bomani things.
543896	546338	Huge Bomani news going on in the scene this week.
546358	547479	We got to talk about this.
547499	548479	You know this is going to be big.
549100	552823	Also, we want to talk about the brand new...
553800	555341	Orange Lounge Radio Production.
555361	556781	There's a brand new show.
557221	558722	You may not have even heard of this yet.
558742	560002	We're going to tell you guys all about it.
560062	560723	It's so cool.
561583	562803	All of that when we get back from this break.
562823	563824	It's called Fun With Butter.
565844	566365	That's right.
566525	567545	It's Fun With Butter.
568085	573127	And we just take DDR Angel and we just douse her in butter and then cook her.
574948	575428	Ah, shit.
575468	576728	Are you going to light me on fire?
578369	578549	Yes.
580060	583022	Let's have DDR Angel hold pears and then set it on fire.
583042	584383	We're being very random tonight.
585803	587784	Let my blackmates light you on fire.
588625	589005	All right.
589485	591646	It's going to be one of those shows, folks.
591807	593267	One of those shows.
593948	594268	All right.
595008	598310	We'll talk about all that fun stuff when we come back from this break.
598954	607918	In this break, we're going to feature music from 2DX, but Jamie requested that we play some 2DX songs that you don't normally hear us play.
608338	611079	So these are underappreciated 2DX songs.
611400	615821	And we're going to start it off with a little ditty from Slake called I'm For Real.
615861	616782	We'll be back after this.
618663	619103	I'm For Real
712543	714165	Thanks for watching!
804733	805219	Thanks for watching!
872245	873167	Thanks for watching!
959631	962912	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
962972	967074	Rhythm and music gaming and video games that don't suck.
967174	967975	And some that do.
982148	983449	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1004500	1007282	Is it just me, or I kind of feel what they're saying.
1007302	1010465	There's a lot of real elitist 2DX players out there.
1010745	1014008	I mean, now, I've always been one that says, you know, just play the damn game.
1014248	1015229	Just have fun with the game.
1015790	1017031	That's why they make it for the home.
1017071	1018592	You can play in the privacy of your own home.
1018652	1023356	Mostly arcades don't even have the game anyway, so you don't have to be intimidated or worry about anything.
1023416	1024717	But what's up with that?
1024757	1026579	Why do people get elitist over 2DX?
1026839	1027379	Any ideas?
1029621	1029801	No?
1030101	1030842	Jamie, any thoughts?
1031683	1031903	This is...
1032230	1038334	Because people have to have something to feel good about themselves, and if they suck at everything else in life, they have to at least be good at 2DX, I don't know.
1039414	1052662	Well, no, I know some good 2DX players that don't suck at life, they're very good at life, and they just happen to be good at 2DX too, but some people, man, it's like, I don't know, instead of having a humongous internet penis, they feel the need to have a humongous 2DX penis.
1053663	1055944	And this, you know, this could be a girl too, don't, you know.
1056772	1059493	Although I actually don't know a whole lot of girls that play 2DX.
1059533	1062453	I know some, and some that are quite good, like Jamie.
1062793	1063713	Jamie plays 2DX.
1064274	1065314	Angel plays a little 2DX.
1067194	1067814	I am not good.
1067854	1073655	But see, that's the whole thing right there, is that you feel like you're not good compared to what?
1075756	1077216	Compared to other people in general?
1077316	1084098	You know what, but any old person walking up the street, if you were to play 2DX for that person, they'd probably go, wow, she's hitting a lot of buttons.
1084398	1085418	It's relative, but I'm...
1086365	1091289	You know, my skill has depreciated a bit at the game, just with lack of practice.
1091930	1093151	So has mine, oh my gosh.
1093591	1099115	Tell you what, if you don't keep practicing these music games, these rhythm beat games, you'll lose it.
1099556	1100396	Boy, do you ever.
1100757	1101217	It's sad.
1101958	1111165	Alright, anyway, let's not get too off topic because we've got to start off tonight's show as we start off every week's show playing a little game, and that game is How was your week?
1111385	1112046	How was your day?
1112967	1114088	Dark Sakura, how was your week?
1114108	1114468	How was your day?
1114781	1115742	I played some 2DX.
1116903	1119205	Well, then you can't beat that out of practice.
1119225	1128753	Well, just a little, but my week's been, it's been a really fucked up week because this is my second to last week at my job.
1129434	1132357	Because I got promoted, going back to where I was before.
1132477	1133197	Congratulations.
1133297	1133638	Thank you.
1133898	1135019	Get a nice raise out of it, too.
1135159	1136280	Alright, raises rock.
1138627	1142010	Now you can buy more useless video game garbage you'll only play one time.
1142170	1143812	This money is getting saved up for my house.
1144632	1148576	So you can have more places to keep all your useless video games.
1148856	1149877	Precisely.
1150177	1151798	None of your stuff is useless though, Jamie.
1151818	1152779	I'm talking in general.
1153039	1157743	I would never make fun of the DarkSakura Museum of Video Gaming.
1158264	1161686	Museum is right, although it's all in boxes most of the places.
1162067	1163568	We're going to be getting rid of a lot of our toys soon.
1164829	1165790	Are you going to put it on eBay?
1166169	1168511	No, we're probably just going to give them away to some charity or something.
1168631	1169112	I'm charity.
1170713	1173636	Okay, do you want a bunch of Ronin Warriors and Exo Squad toys?
1173816	1174796	I would never.
1174837	1179360	They re-released a bunch of the Macross toys as Exo Squad toys, and we have them.
1181642	1183544	We should give them away as prizes on the show.
1183564	1185005	Oh, I did!
1185145	1188548	I did manage to get more V-Rares.
1189189	1192732	More copies of the EX and Ultra Mix V-Rares.
1193840	1202122	So I have three of each, and maybe doing something with those as far as prize-related things.
1203262	1203462	Alright.
1203902	1205682	Excuse me.
1206122	1213284	I've also had this burning spot at the back of my throat, just like a little rough spot, so my voice has been kind of, uh, all day.
1213944	1214884	I saw The Grudge again.
1215664	1216044	How was that?
1216104	1216524	In the theater.
1217244	1220065	Well, it would have been great, except for the morons talking behind us, so...
1220618	1225220	My friend turns around, this is at the Sunrise Theater, she turns around and says, do you want me to beat you in the head?
1226581	1228582	That was almost like my experience when I went and saw The Grudge.
1228702	1230282	This was right at the beginning of the movie.
1230622	1232403	Oh no, this was towards the end when I saw it.
1233544	1242448	And there was this guy, this like jock guy sitting in the back going, and I turn around and go, well the guy with the little penis in the back row, please shut up.
1243783	1246965	Well, there was this one kid that just started belching in the last half of the movie.
1247485	1250808	I'm like, wow, it must be special to be able to burp in a movie.
1250828	1251948	Only retards do that.
1252809	1254130	And so he stopped.
1255170	1258353	It was just a little... His mom was there, too.
1259593	1262755	So I felt like making a comment about how she raised her children.
1262815	1264196	Isn't your mother proud of you now?
1266838	1267599	But anyway...
1268897	1270698	It's just been a very weird week.
1270758	1277843	And like Friday was also my boss's boss, who is the AVP in our department, her last day.
1278744	1283828	And we just ended up talking about stuff in general about... How last days rock.
1284628	1288271	About our opinion of certain people, you know.
1288731	1290873	And just in general, and I hardly touched the phone.
1290913	1292033	I took like 20 calls all day.
1292934	1293955	I ate carrot cake.
1296096	1298358	And I did body sculpting for the first time on Tuesday.
1299190	1302391	And I was so sore, but I was like, Mom, I'm going to go spin the next day.
1302411	1304731	I'm going to be a good little workoutaholic.
1305671	1307212	Oh my God, I was in such pain.
1307672	1308372	I didn't go Thursday.
1308692	1309372	I didn't go Friday.
1309552	1310712	I didn't go yesterday.
1311333	1312193	I did crap.
1312533	1313813	That's like my DDR diet.
1313873	1316294	I played like four days in a row, and then I didn't play for five.
1316454	1317354	And then I played yesterday.
1318394	1319674	I played PSO last night.
1320474	1321295	And on the internet.
1321975	1322815	And went to TapX.
1324135	1327616	I went to the new TapX on... There's a new TapX?
1328095	1329396	Hell, no, on Hell.
1332397	1334899	It intersects with Hell off of Fair Oaks.
1334979	1335919	Off Fair Oaks, actually.
1336699	1337760	Oh, I didn't even know there was a new one.
1337800	1339681	It's tucked away back there, but they have fish balls on the menu.
1340121	1344924	And they have real spring rolls, like the Vietnamese-style spring rolls, with the thin wraps.
1345084	1348786	For those that don't have Tap-X, what's Tap-X, for those that may not know?
1348826	1349426	Tapioca Express.
1349786	1355409	It's basically, you can get all kinds of tea, juices, and milk tea, coffee...
1355854	1356434	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1384727	1387988	In fact, Angel's got some balls... Kind of sticky and squishy.
1388108	1389948	Angel's got some balls mints with her right now.
1389968	1391088	I'll have to put these on cam.
1392849	1395949	So I can put Angel's balls in my mouth, which I think I'm going to do right now.
1396910	1400110	I'm going to look politely in the other direction.
1400290	1401230	Hey, look, ferret!
1404671	1406292	Anything else you want to share about your week and your day?
1407292	1408332	Um, no.
1408572	1408752	Bye.
1411513	1412813	Alrighty, let's move on to Loki!
1412853	1413233	Loki!
1414332	1415693	Logi, how was your week?
1415713	1416333	How was your day, Logi?
1417794	1418674	My week was alright.
1419074	1420755	I've been buying stuff.
1421996	1425037	Stuff for my project, my other project.
1425337	1428639	Because, you know, all the other projects I start without finishing the other ones.
1429659	1432180	But this one should be done pretty quick, though, because it's a small one.
1433641	1438543	But everything to build my micro-ITX PC that's going to be inside of an Xbox.
1439664	1441285	That's going to be for our roadshows.
1442586	1443207	So I have it all.
1443367	1445450	Right now most of it is stacked on that table right there.
1447714	1449637	But everything else is still coming in for it.
1449777	1451640	The only thing I have left to purchase on is Ram.
1452100	1452501	And then...
1454085	1482380	Any other peripherals that plug into it And then, you know, any other miscellaneous case modding crap I want to do to it So I have that And then, this week I've been playing a lot of Final Fantasy That type of stuff Also been playing a lot of the Guy game, actually Which is quite funny Because it's a fun trivia game with boobies in it And, let's see what else Oh, just, you know, watched a few movies And that kind of thing
1483576	1484856	Overall, pretty easy week.
1486077	1490538	And, um... Yeah, that's all that's pretty much been going on.
1490958	1491698	Just that kind of stuff.
1498680	1504621	Alright, and my week and my day was, um... Okay, I guess I had a very lazy day.
1504741	1506582	I've had a very lazy weekend, come to think of it.
1506922	1508322	I really done crap this weekend.
1508342	1510262	I played a lot of Final Fantasy, that's for sure.
1511343	1511863	Addict!
1512003	1512363	Whatever.
1514913	1519977	That's alright, we've sucked DDR Angel into our little addiction and soon you will be next.
1519997	1523240	Okay, I tried that little addiction, you know what?
1523780	1525481	It was crap, so I stopped playing.
1525581	1527703	As long as you didn't ditch us for World of Warcraft.
1528504	1530385	Should we tell her about the character problem?
1530645	1530905	Oops.
1533687	1536970	Anyway, let's see, what else was I going to say?
1536990	1537070	Okay.
1538024	1538985	Death's the best part
1566816	1568554	well, not when you're the one that's dying
1569431	1575533	When you're killing other people, it's okay, but I was the one that kept dying, so... I don't know, I just went back into Final Fantasy XI where I don't die as much.
1576794	1581915	But I got to play Halo 2 last night, and I forgot that it actually can be a lot of fun when you're killing your friends.
1582536	1596901	So, I need to, like, have a Halo 2 night or something, where I set aside a night and play Halo 2, because it's much more fun to play with your friends than it is to play strangers on Xbox Live, who are, like, a gazillion times better than you are, and just get on there and say...
1598021	1600423	I'm gonna shoot you down, faggot.
1600523	1601503	I'm gonna kill you.
1603145	1605126	Nigga, I'm the best one at this game.
1607087	1609849	And I swear, people on Xbox Live, they talk just like that.
1609889	1611010	I'm not even exaggerating.
1611070	1614112	So if you're offended by what I said, just go on Xbox Live.
1614152	1614573	It's worse.
1617455	1620357	Anyway, what else is going on?
1620657	1620977	I don't know.
1621017	1623919	I was kind of hoping to do a little bit of traveling this weekend, but that didn't happen.
1623959	1626501	But next weekend is a three-day weekend.
1627316	1631819	So I don't know if it's going to be a drunk show Sunday night or if I'm going to go out after the show next Sunday.
1632819	1634220	I'll drink if someone can get me home.
1634981	1635401	Let's see.
1635421	1636241	We'll have to see what we can do.
1636361	1637662	But it's a three-day weekend for me next week.
1637702	1638683	I'm playing hooky on Friday, too.
1638963	1640664	Our work celebrates Martin Luther King Day.
1641104	1642065	So we get it off.
1642425	1642905	It's pretty cool.
1644226	1646067	Actually, speaking of that, if I can add one more thing.
1646487	1646808	Sure.
1647028	1649029	I'm going to the Skywalker Ranch on Friday.
1649869	1650390	What for?
1650890	1652371	My friend works for LucasArts.
1653843	1655264	So I'm going to do school stuff that morning.
1655284	1657704	I'm playing hooky anyway on Friday, on my last day.
1658345	1660305	And we're going to the Skywalker Ranch for lunch.
1661226	1663667	You should take some business cards.
1664927	1665687	Give me some business cards.
1665707	1666168	We can find some.
1666208	1666888	Alright, anyway.
1666908	1668509	Sorry, I just wanted to throw that in.
1668529	1670989	Whoring out Orange Lounge Radio everywhere we can.
1672690	1675531	I guess that's all I really have to say about my week and my day, and not a whole lot.
1675651	1676552	I did see some movies.
1677232	1681053	I saw that movie Finding Neverland, which is kind of like an artsy film that's up for Golden Globes.
1681533	1681994	Very good.
1682474	1682994	Very good film.
1683447	1684807	If you like Johnny Depp, you'll like this movie.
1685748	1686288	Alright, that's it.
1687228	1688068	Enough of me, I'm boring.
1688629	1689349	Angel, how was your week?
1689389	1689749	How was your day?
1690649	1691950	I'm even more boring, so there.
1692290	1694530	Excuse me.
1695070	1695431	Let's see.
1696971	1703353	Well, I guess for the gaggy part of my week, because I know you guys are all going to gag and go, oh, not.
1704913	1707774	Magus and I celebrated our two year anniversary, so yay.
1709935	1710035	Oh!
1711584	1712224	See, he told you.
1712645	1715987	Anyway, I also played a lot of Final Fantasy XI.
1716027	1717148	Thank you, Rob.
1717828	1718228	Hey!
1721350	1723512	And, yeah, signed up for school.
1724092	1725313	Ow, that was expensive.
1725513	1725933	Oh well.
1726634	1728635	Not as expensive as Jamie's, I'm sure, but still.
1731037	1732838	Because she's taking a lot more classes than I am.
1733018	1734919	How many classes are you taking?
1735220	1735440	Three.
1736340	1736861	How many units?
1737301	1739382	Three, because there are only one unit classes each.
1739522	1740323	Oh, okay.
1740836	1742477	I'm taking four three-unit classes.
1742957	1744218	Well, no one's a two.
1744478	1746279	Well, yeah, it's not my full-time.
1746439	1748239	I'm working full-time.
1748840	1750701	Yeah, I got that too, so.
1751581	1751801	Hmm?
1752702	1753462	I got that too.
1754622	1758164	Yeah, well, I've got work too and all that stuff, so.
1759565	1762226	Other than that, I didn't really do much this week.
1762906	1765067	So, I'm more boring than Rob is.
1767248	1768449	As if that's possible.
1769857	1776903	I forgot to say, one other thing I did is that I went to the bookstore, Borders Books, and I got a book about starting your own business.
1776923	1777463	You can read?
1778224	1779765	Amazingly enough, I can.
1781587	1785350	I thought that if you were a corporate trainer, you couldn't read and had bad grammar.
1785370	1786911	Very funny, very funny.
1789269	1795251	You know, well, I have horrible handwriting, so whenever I write on the board, for those who don't know, my day job is I'm a corporate trainer.
1795771	1797472	And when I write on the board, it's very yucky.
1797512	1798753	That's why I like to use PowerPoint.
1799773	1805735	It was very much a tease because I have known some where I work who have the worst grammar ever.
1806155	1808056	I am the best corporate trainer you'll ever have.
1808096	1808856	You are the best.
1808876	1811057	You should come work where I work.
1811737	1815399	If you give me a job making what I'm going to be making in my new position, sure.
1817225	1819027	Everybody should come work where I work.
1819207	1821689	Except I'm not going to tell you where I work because I don't need any more stalkers.
1823971	1824312	Anyway.
1825192	1827014	Oh yeah, so I got the book on starting your own business.
1827074	1830257	So that, you know, because we're thinking about it with Orange Launch Radio.
1830277	1830938	We're thinking about it.
1831939	1832519	We're thinking about it.
1833820	1835222	Actually making this legit.
1835282	1837083	We've been doing it for, what, two and a half years now?
1837124	1838465	I think it's about time to make this legit.
1839526	1841688	We've always been in the business to sex you up.
1847382	1849171	on that note I think we're going to go to a break
1850934	1880318	and when we come back from this break I know we got a list list we want to do tonight I know we've got something that new project we want to plug for those that haven't figured it out we got a cage match we want to do we got big DDR news very full plate for us when we come back in this break I thought we could do some poppy DDR music like some DDR poppy music starting it off with one of the most poppy songs of all Dark Knight wanted to dedicate this to his friend who's having a rough week so I'm gonna do that for him because we here at Orange Lounge Radio we care
1881417	1881718	We care.
1882620	1884564	We'll be back after this with more Orange Launch Radio.
1975925	1977086	I made a My Bad there.
1977166	1981127	That was actually for DJ Ranma S's friend, not Dark Knight's friend.
1981167	1983167	Although maybe Dark Knight wanted to hear it too, I have no idea.
1983267	1987709	But as you can tell, I usually get too many private messages during the show, so I screwed up.
1987809	1988189	My Bad!
1990930	1995851	My Bad
2041729	2042653	Thank you for watching
2078488	2083170	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
2113012	2114294	Thank you for watching!
2146298	2147820	Thank you for watching!
2231008	2235312	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2261272	2277166	Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.
2283251	2286534	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 126.
2289008	2291049	Yeah, I know, I can't believe we've been doing it that long either.
2291910	2300775	Anyway, we have been doing this quite a while, but there's always new stuff cooking up over at Orange Lounge Radio, and we have a brand new thing.
2301195	2307938	It just launched earlier this week, but we know a lot of you guys don't really pay attention to anything we do outside of this Sunday show, so we want to let you guys know.
2308479	2317684	There's actually a brand new show, and one of the most common requests we get here on Orange Lounge Radio is, can we download your show?
2318363	2320344	and to that we say, no, you can't.
2320644	2322665	The files are too big.
2322705	2323865	How does it feel to want?
2324786	2326506	Basically, A, the files are too big.
2326606	2329668	B, we want people to listen live and it hoards up our ratings.
2329728	2332329	And C, you can always catch the rewinds on DDR-free radio Fridays at 6.
2333029	2333349	Whatever.
2333449	2336411	So that is just not happening right now anyway.
2336451	2339312	I can't say it's never going to happen, but just right at this time it's not happening.
2339412	2344214	But we decided, we thought, well, let's give them something they can download.
2344234	2347175	And there's this new technology out there called podcasting.
2347759	2347959	P.O.D.D.E.R.
2368464	2370405	Do you have to have an iPod to hear this show?
2370845	2371125	No.
2371565	2376287	Do you have to have a live 365 account or do you have to listen to the station live to hear this show?
2376507	2376727	No.
2376867	2379148	It's something you download onto your computer.
2379168	2380669	Do you have to have broadband to hear this show?
2380809	2380969	No.
2381029	2382370	It's just going to be a little slower for you.
2382890	2385011	So check out on our website.
2385091	2386952	There's a new feature over on the left side.
2387032	2389132	It's called Orange Lounge Radio To Go.
2389653	2394154	And it's basically a brand new, I don't know, 15 to 25 minute show.
2394495	2395155	It's a mini show.
2395856	2398861	But it's something that's intended for you to download every week.
2398941	2408939	And for those of you guys that do have some type of portable media player such as an iPod, the whole reason it's called podcasting is because iPod is the most popular form of this.
2409737	2417980	But if you have any portable media player, really, what this is designed to do is that you can subscribe to the Orange Launch Radio podcast and then just keep checking it.
2418240	2422381	Have your iPod or program check every week or so, or check every day.
2422861	2426402	And every Monday or so, you're going to see a new show from us.
2426683	2432444	And if you have a media player, it'll hook right up to your media player so that you'll have a new show to listen to for that week.
2432644	2433365	So it's pretty cool.
2433705	2434705	You've got to check it out.
2435105	2437226	There's already an episode up there for grabs.
2437786	2441848	If you want to subscribe, I know a few of you guys have been having problems getting the most recent episode.
2442168	2445210	We're hoping that when we put up a new episode, it's going to fix all that.
2445610	2446671	So just stay tuned.
2447451	2449712	Go ahead, subscribe to it, and keep checking.
2449752	2454334	There should be a new episode up tomorrow, if not late, late tonight, possibly.
2455135	2456576	But there is one already there.
2456636	2458937	We taped a show last week, and it got put up there.
2459893	2461614	and a lot of folks have already been downloading it.
2461674	2470781	In fact, I think we might have some new folks listening to this show who actually heard the podcast first because the podcast is such a huge new technology that's out there.
2470821	2473443	A lot of people are just downloading new shows as they can find it.
2474023	2477165	And if you came all this way to listen to our live show, hey, thanks a bunch.
2477826	2480067	Stop on in the chat room and let us know you enjoyed it.
2480888	2483930	www.OrangeLaunchRadio.com Click on chat.
2485043	2488724	And yes, it is a show we plan to do every week, if not more.
2489104	2497826	We might actually, I mean, when we go on the road, such as, oh, I don't know, E3, we might be able to use this technology to do updates every day.
2497906	2499746	Little shows, little interviews from E3.
2499826	2501407	So, stay tuned.
2501607	2501987	It's very cool.
2502007	2503207	I also have the Infernal Machine.
2504047	2504327	Mm-hmm.
2505848	2506988	So, yeah, that...
2509417	2510557	So, wow.
2511298	2512079	Lots of stuff there.
2512119	2513620	The podcast is an exciting feature.
2513680	2516982	Remember, all you've got to do is subscribe and you're set.
2518510	2531100	Now, of course, all the chat room is saying the next step is Orange Lounge Radio Television and I want my OLR TV, which is kind of funny because when you think about it, I don't know if you knew this, but do you know who one of the driving forces behind podcasting was?
2531200	2533942	One of the people that kind of came up with the idea with some friends?
2534523	2538085	Adam Curry, the MTV VJ from years ago.
2538366	2539146	Dude, he was cool.
2539366	2540187	He was awesome.
2540307	2544730	And now he's got this thing, which just makes him even more cool.
2544831	2546592	So, you know, it's awesome.
2547116	2551798	You know, it would be, like, ultimately cool if, like, it were also sponsored by Martha Quinn.
2552378	2553118	Then I would be happy.
2553158	2555059	Because she has nice hair.
2555519	2560141	Instead of being hosted by us, we'll just have Julie Brown and... You know what we need?
2560341	2560562	What?
2560802	2565644	We need to do something... When we have our TV show, we need, like, the remote control segment.
2566524	2567544	Complete with those chairs.
2567985	2569185	Seriously, remote control.
2569425	2572927	That could be, like, our game show, the match game segment or something.
2573327	2574367	If you get the answer wrong.
2574927	2576108	Nah, nah, nah, nah.
2578122	2579423	I remember when MTV was cool.
2579744	2581145	I know, now they suck on ice.
2581185	2584848	But the weird thing is, how old were we when MTV was cool?
2584928	2587070	Maybe 12, around that age?
2587511	2592115	I think the tale of when MTV was cool was when I was a senior in high school, so I was 18.
2592835	2597399	Was probably when these guys like Adam Curry and Martha Quinn and them were still on the air.
2597860	2599061	We're showing our age a little bit.
2599517	2600117	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2620502	2631892	Back when Mike Myers and Dana Carvey and all them were on... Now, some would argue with you that this old 75 cast with Bill Murray... Well, they were great too, but I mean as far as the more modern era of Saturday Night Live.
2632392	2635295	And then I would probably turn on 120 Minutes and Headbangers Ball.
2636716	2637517	My God, look at this!
2638012	2641473	Our chat room right now, you've got to see this over in OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on chat.
2641673	2647094	They're practically creating this whole treatment for an Orange Lounge Radio TV show that could be on MTV.
2647134	2653336	They're saying, oh, the cage match could have videos on it, people could vote, and it's crazy.
2653476	2654036	That's awesome.
2654096	2654756	You guys rock.
2656257	2656577	I don't know.
2656657	2657637	I don't know what to tell you guys.
2657977	2664839	I'd love to see it happen someday, but at the same time, got to pay the rent, so I can't quit my J-Dub yet until somebody...
2666235	2667516	Here, Rob, here's some money.
2667936	2668616	Come do a show.
2668916	2670317	Then I'd be all, fuck yeah, I quit.
2671037	2671377	We'll see.
2671657	2675458	And I'm sure you're the same, right?
2676098	2678219	Get paid to do Wayne's World?
2678679	2680860	Shut up.
2682841	2685782	That's like my dream right there is Wayne's World, the movie.
2685802	2687422	Except don't they get kind of screwed in the end?
2688062	2688322	Oh well.
2689343	2689763	Who cares?
2691246	2702963	We'll see, maybe someday But I think the podcast is a really exciting technology because it allows people like Adam Curry to hear us Anyway, we'll see what happens
2704241	2704581	All right.
2705242	2707063	Anyway, so there's the podcast.
2707163	2711007	Again, I urge you guys to check this out on the website over at orangelaunchradio.com.
2711027	2711867	Just look in the upper left.
2711907	2713308	It says Orange Launch Radio to go.
2713829	2715390	It's really easy to set up.
2715490	2722856	Honestly, if you were able to listen to this show, if you were able to sign up for Live 365 and get this show to play, you can do this podcast thing.
2722916	2723797	It's super easy.
2724097	2725899	And again, you don't have to have a portable player.
2726199	2730963	You can just have it download the MP3 and you listen to it in Winamp or iTunes or whatever later.
2731423	2742045	And just an FYI, for those of you guys that do listen to this, that show is actually encoded in MP3 Pro, which doesn't do you any good if you have an iPod, because iPods don't decode it.
2742085	2745905	But if you're using Winamp, you can actually listen to that show in MP3 Pro, and it sounds great.
2746966	2747706	So, just a thought.
2748446	2748706	Alright.
2749566	2749846	Anyway.
2751086	2752387	On to some actual gaming news.
2752427	2754027	Let's talk gaming news that's going on right now.
2754627	2755787	Huge... No, this is huge.
2755827	2756567	This is really huge.
2759288	2759588	Alright.
2760328	2760408	In...
2761541	2763783	The DDR scene this week, there was huge news.
2764443	2770007	What has been one thing that people in the DDR scene have been begging for for the longest time?
2770888	2771708	Other than to get laid.
2773189	2774910	A 62 foot long cigar?
2776411	2777993	No, not a 62 foot long cigar.
2778013	2778353	What else?
2782335	2783997	They want more Mambo and Go-Go.
2785478	2790281	They want a DDR game featuring characters from other games that have nothing to do with DDR whatsoever.
2791257	2792259	That's absolutely right.
2792319	2794943	No, actually, I'll tell you, since you obviously don't know.
2795364	2797909	They want a DDR game on the GameCube.
2798850	2800233	Because GameCube doesn't have a DDR game.
2800253	2801214	There was one on the Nintendo 64.
2801735	2802697	Well, not the GameCube.
2804446	2809010	So, GameCube announced this week is getting its own DDR game.
2809811	2814896	Does this fulfill my fantasy for having to buy yet another peripheral for another game system to play DDR?
2815076	2817458	You can never have too many specialty controllers, dammit.
2817558	2818339	It absolutely does.
2818599	2821742	And if you think about it, Nintendo is really the granddaddy of DDR.
2821782	2823464	The granddaddy, granddaddy, granddaddy.
2823484	2826206	Like, the great, great granddaddy of DDR is Dance Aerobics.
2827307	2829029	If you think about it, with the power pad.
2829649	2830150	So, um...
2831187	2835670	It makes sense that it's going back to its roots and DDR is going to be showing up on the GameCube.
2836210	2838231	Details are very sketchy at this time.
2838331	2839112	This is what we know.
2839552	2842434	It's DDR featuring Mario.
2844455	2848678	We can urge to refer to old cartoon Rising.
2849318	2850439	I know, I know, seriously.
2851219	2853421	Absolutely the first thing I thought of when I heard this.
2853521	2858404	I read this story and it was very... Earlier this week the rain was keeping me up at like 4 in the morning.
2858965	2876816	and I ended up getting online and I read about this and just instantly I couldn't help but when I read that DDR and Mario were teaming up to do this I couldn't help but think about this Hey Paisanos, it's the Super Mario Brothers Super Show
2877560	2879462	Thank you late 80s early 90s
2930429	2933892	Oh, you gotta love that echo at the end.
2934152	2936274	Hooked on the brothers, brothers, brothers.
2937295	2940598	I am petitioning Nintendo myself to have that song included.
2941499	2942420	It needs to be there.
2942560	2944622	It absolutely needs to be there in DDR Mario.
2945223	2947145	Or the one with Lou Albano singing it at the end.
2947385	2949587	Let's all do some Mario.
2949647	2950188	Remember that one?
2950928	2952670	I wish we had an MP3 of that we could play too, but...
2953832	2966140	So, here it is, Nintendo is going to be doing this DDR game, but Konami, it's some kind of partnership, and we don't really know in what capacity, if Nintendo is making the game with Konami's blessing, or what's going on.
2966380	2975807	I have a feeling it's going to be very similar to Donkey Konga, because when you look at Donkey Konga, it's basically Taiko Drum Master, but with Donkey Konga.
2976787	2977568	Stupid clapping!
2978607	2980148	But it had Namco's blessing.
2980349	2982070	Namco actually helped him out with the game.
2982110	2983872	So I think it's going to be very similar to that.
2983892	2984792	That's just speculation.
2984812	2985133	We'll see.
2985273	2985513	Loki?
2986654	2987615	There's one thing for sure.
2987655	2988936	It's going to have awesome minigames.
2988956	2992579	Because if there's one thing that Nintendo's good at, it's making minigames for games.
2993760	3002547	So that would be a lot better than that crappy, what, feed the oddly shaped animal heads or whatever, you know?
3003168	3006871	Or the frustrating, hit the ball around the maze thing.
3007571	3009174	That's a lot better than that.
3013564	3014185	I just can't.
3014465	3015648	No, I can't buy this game.
3017952	3019593	It's alright, because I'm definitely going to buy it.
3019633	3020354	I have to buy this game.
3020814	3026359	If you actually look at our website, orangelawnradio.com, we actually posted a story about this earlier this week.
3026419	3027660	It's like the second story down.
3027720	3033885	It says, DDR teaming up with Mario, and if you actually click on the read more, you can see some screenshots from the game.
3034405	3040550	And the first two screenshots look like your standard DDR setup, although the two-player mode is interesting.
3040610	3041111	It looks like
3042074	3043634	Some of the dancing characters you can have.
3043654	3048095	You have a little Mario, and then it looks like a little... Either that's a Hammer Brother, or it's a Koopa Troopa.
3048115	3050176	I can't really tell, because it's from the Skyview.
3050196	3052276	I think it's a Hammer Brother, because I see a hammer in the picture.
3052837	3056577	So it looks like those are some of the, maybe, dancing characters that might be available.
3056617	3056978	Who knows?
3057738	3064119	But then the third picture in there, it shows Mario running from snowballs, and there are no arrows on the screen.
3064539	3066760	So it makes you think that it's some kind of minigame.
3066840	3071561	So I think it's definite that there's got to be a minigame that's going to turn up in here somewhere.
3072702	3077265	All it really is, is it comes down to... Look, Konami made a DDR pad.
3077466	3080868	Okay, now we don't have to make another power pad, so let's make another power pad game.
3081929	3082469	That's what it is.
3084991	3088194	I just... Nintendo, I think, is finally realizing they missed the boat on DDR.
3088214	3089314	They should have had this a long time ago.
3089695	3090916	And that Mad Catz game?
3090956	3091536	What the hell was that?
3091676	3092597	MC Groove thing?
3093798	3094038	Okay.
3094904	3095964	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3120268	3128434	or you can play Parents Don't Understand for like five minutes because they don't cut their songs down and then the arrows don't make any sense at all and they come from the middle of the screen.
3128534	3129194	What the hell?
3129915	3130775	Oh, you can play In the Groove.
3132457	3136379	I would play In the Groove for three days straight before I would ever touch that other game.
3137500	3137900	Yes, Angel?
3138721	3139481	You look like you have a comment.
3139501	3143925	I feel a little scared because you were just talking about the whole Mario thing and what shirt am I wearing?
3144145	3144485	Oops!
3145566	3146046	There you go.
3146066	3146626	You're in the mood.
3146646	3147427	You're being festive.
3148528	3148808	All right.
3149338	3151060	I'm wearing my DDR Freak shirt.
3151160	3152401	Yay!
3152521	3152902	Wow.
3153482	3156085	Now, if you two merged your shirts, you'd have this new game.
3157286	3159889	Very true, in a weird sort of way, yeah.
3159909	3160290	Scary.
3160430	3164234	The working title of this game is Dance Dance Revolution with Mario.
3166297	3167939	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3186956	3210233	Many games, it looks like it's going to come out summer of 2005 is when this game is scheduled to come out We're going to get the first peek at the game at the 2005 World Hobby Fair And that happens in Tokyo on January 16th So by this time next week, we ought to know some more details on this game So we'll definitely pass it along to you as soon as we know
3213371	3213671	Alright.
3214993	3217316	Any wishes you guys hope to see with this game?
3217396	3219859	The Dance Dance Revolution with Mario game?
3220660	3221601	Anything on your wish list?
3223616	3227537	I want the swimming music to be in there.
3230698	3232899	Don't make me break out my cell phone.
3232999	3235879	I don't know how they would... No, you know what has to be in there?
3235899	3236640	Speaking of cell phones.
3237180	3237500	Uh-oh.
3237660	3237980	Okay.
3238260	3238980	Let me get out my cell phone.
3239420	3240141	All right.
3240161	3243621	Meantime, while she's digging for that, Angel, wish list for this dance set?
3243661	3251484	Yeah, I was going to say a remix of the water music myself, but if we can't have that, then I guess the... What is it?
3251544	3252264	Level 2 music?
3252344	3252524	The...
3253044	3255105	You know, the blue level.
3255826	3256526	After the first one.
3256546	3257227	The blue level.
3257987	3258688	No, the... Here we go.
3262910	3263210	Yes!
3264011	3264871	Super Mario World!
3265031	3265532	Yay!
3267353	3268774	Can you really dance to that?
3269254	3269574	Yes.
3270175	3271435	In a really messed up sort of way?
3271475	3271776	Sure.
3271796	3273196	It'd be kind of hard.
3276699	3280501	I want the Campfire medley from Donkey Konga.
3280521	3281161	Okay.
3283331	3284171	I love my phone.
3284911	3286592	It's a medley of all these campfire songs.
3286672	3287872	That's pretty good quality.
3289213	3291933	Loki, your wish list for Dance Dance Revolution with Mario?
3293814	3298175	That that be the only game they release on the GameCube for DDR.
3299895	3300876	Why you gotta hate?
3300976	3302476	Why you being such a hater with this?
3302536	3303156	I've gotta know.
3304557	3306197	It's gonna suck just like Donkey Konga.
3307563	3309525	I didn't think Donkey Konga sucked.
3309545	3310546	There could have been more to it.
3310566	3311508	Okay, we get the idea, Jimmy.
3311708	3312308	Seriously, we get it.
3312889	3316933	I was wondering when you'd say something.
3320718	3324502	Donkey Konga, there could have been more to it, but it wasn't a bad game.
3324522	3326624	Yeah, it was.
3327754	3328174	Whatever.
3328695	3329035	All right.
3330936	3338700	My wish list, I want to see Princess Peach as a dancing character, and whenever the stage is over, she'll go, Peach is the winner!
3339461	3340121	Just like at Mario Party.
3340141	3341282	Hopefully they don't hooch her all up.
3342202	3349947	Dude, they should have Princess Peach in the Emmy costume that was shown at the Ultimix 2 demo at E3 when Emmy was all hoochified.
3350407	3351808	They need that, but Princess Peach.
3351828	3352508	It would be awesome.
3355723	3357484	I can't wait to find out more information about this game.
3357904	3365248	I actually think this game has the potential to be very cool, because Nintendo, they've just got such classic songs, and it's going to be so cute.
3365528	3370531	It's probably going to be geared for kids, and it'll probably end up being like OHA DDR, but I don't care.
3370851	3373493	Or Disney's Rave, Disney's Mix, whatever you call it.
3376054	3379336	By the way, we need more kiddie DDR.
3379716	3382057	We need to get them hooked young, like crack.
3383447	3384107	Jungle Book or something?
3413017	3413598	Oh, God.
3413658	3416421	The game that got me a dance pad for the first time.
3416441	3417181	You had that tiny thing.
3417242	3417582	I did.
3417722	3418483	It was... Okay.
3419013	3421034	And I had to bring you Third Mix to fix that.
3421114	3425796	This was, it was the very first US release of a dancing game.
3425836	3428257	This was out before Dance Dance Revolution USA.
3428677	3430738	And it was the Jungle Book dance game.
3430778	3434380	It was put out by, I don't remember what the game, it was Jungle Groove.
3434540	3435720	Yeah, I think it was called Jungle Groove.
3436281	3440762	And it actually came with a little dance mat, but the dance mat was made for like a five year old.
3441163	3443504	But I bought it because I wanted a dance mat.
3444904	3447645	And it was this... I remember that Lou Bega was in it.
3448125	3453007	Because, like, he did a cover of that song that went, I wanna walk like you, talk like you, too.
3453147	3454267	Remember that song from the Jungle Book?
3454667	3457368	And that was, like, the big song you could unlock if you played it enough.
3458188	3458649	What, Loki?
3458669	3461189	You're giving EDS, Evil's Death, stare over here.
3462710	3469152	Like I said before, this is why they do not need to make any more games for the GameCube that feature DDR.
3469352	3471793	Or, I know this was, like, for the Nintendo 64.
3471833	3472613	It still sucked.
3473106	3474387	Still, a Nintendo game sucked.
3474948	3476490	This game actually was PlayStation.
3476530	3477911	This was a PlayStation game that I bought.
3478171	3478672	Still sucked.
3479952	3484196	And I remember that this was right when I was starting to get into DDR.
3484496	3488419	And I finally remember that Jamie and some other folks all came to my apartment.
3488880	3493964	And Jamie actually brought a little plug, a mod plug that would plug into the back of the PlayStation.
3494124	3494965	The game killer.
3495085	3495745	The game killer.
3496126	3499749	And then she brought a copy of Third Mix.
3500469	3505634	And we played DDR Third Mix on my little Jungle Book dance mat that's made for five-year-olds.
3506278	3510599	and I don't remember, I think it was LankyStyle was dancing to Graduizic Cyber.
3511679	3514560	Funny stuff on that little five-year-old dance pad.
3516821	3517221	Memories.
3518961	3519962	Finally the damn thing broke.
3519982	3521302	That was a long-ass time ago.
3521402	3523703	The down arrow broke on that thing after like a week.
3524043	3524943	This was what?
3526029	3526890	4 years ago.
3526910	3527530	5 years ago.
3548423	3550825	and we found the Golf Land Machine December of 2000.
3550985	3552466	That's when we really started getting into it.
3552486	3553127	So it was early 2001 then.
3553167	3553547	It was early 2001.
3553587	3554648	But it was in the winter time.
3555328	3564435	I didn't even know we had machines in town until like September of 2000 when I would go play the 1.5.
3566276	3566657	Oh yes.
3567037	3568958	And play Boom Boom Dollar over and over again.
3570299	3571841	Do you remember what the trick code was?
3571921	3572861	I don't even remember what it was.
3573502	3575423	It was like left, left, down, down, right, right or something.
3575463	3575904	I don't remember.
3576424	3577545	No, it was the running steps.
3578433	3579473	Was it left, down, right, down, left?
3579654	3580714	Left, down, right, down, left.
3580734	3583635	I thought there was, you had to hit one of them twice.
3584876	3587037	It was, that was for Maniac.
3588217	3593259	Back in my day, you didn't get to just push the little button and be on Maniac steps.
3593279	3596320	You had to do the little... We didn't have Vivid.
3596941	3599242	We had, they were all one color and we liked it.
3599442	3601783	And it wasn't called Heavy, it was called Maniac.
3601803	3602123	Maniac.
3602683	3604344	Because you had to be one to play on it.
3605284	3607505	And we had one paranoia mix.
3609787	3610327	Absolutely.
3610767	3611348	So bad.
3611428	3612068	Preach on.
3613809	3616250	Now I'm all in the mood for some nostalgic DDR music.
3618131	3619111	So I think we're going to take a break.
3619751	3624053	And when we come back from this break, more stuff, including tonight's cage match.
3624553	3628035	We're going to do a list list tonight at some point, and who knows what else.
3628135	3629716	So we'll be back after this.
3630556	3630816	Enjoy.

4034926	4036648	Some people are already saying, it's going to suck.
4037088	4037789	Game's going to suck.
4037869	4038529	It's going to be horrible.
4038669	4039570	Worst game ever.
4041832	4042552	We shall see.
4042993	4043793	We shall soon see.
4044894	4050739	Somebody was talking about, then somehow the chat in the chatroom went on to playing DDR with a light gun.
4052512	4052912	DarkSakura.com
4072278	4074339	The screw.
4074359	4078282	Yes, there's a screw.
4078502	4079343	That's right, that's key.
4079463	4079843	That's right.
4080444	4083646	But, yeah, that's what it reminded me of when you said light gun and DDR heroes.
4083666	4084727	No one going, no!
4084747	4088849	Oh, boy.
4089150	4089550	All right.
4091171	4094413	I hope this... You know, we don't know for sure if DDR Mario is even going to come to America.
4096015	4099357	It's so far, you know, all the writings in Japanese, so... But I would...
4101791	4104912	Loki says no plans, but I say it's gotta happen.
4105052	4106993	They would be idiots not to port this to the US.
4107013	4107413	Freeloader.
4108874	4109514	Not even that.
4109694	4110914	All you need is Freeloader.
4110994	4113895	I know, but I don't even... I want to play a US mix.
4114976	4118757	Nintendo would be absolute morons to not bring this game to the US.
4119097	4120018	Absolute morons.
4123739	4124159	Yeah.
4125920	4126860	No, actually, no, they wouldn't.
4126900	4128241	Keep it far away from the States.
4128401	4129181	Far, far away.
4130017	4130538	Don't hate!
4130778	4131218	Don't hate!
4145560	4146541	Thanks for watching!
4161571	4163573	Anyways, he does some really kick-ass sim files.
4163613	4175021	He's done one for Ecstasy, the 14 Hours Club mix, the Gravity, DarkSakura, Burn Nation mix, and Legend of Tak on there.
4175542	4181206	And he's also done some other cool songs, so go check those out on Bomani Style.
4181246	4188972	And if I'm nice, I might go and link them in the LiveJournal community for Orange Lounge Radio, which you can find on LiveJournal.com.
4191124	4193025	I'm so glad you took the opportunity to whore that out.
4193085	4194807	Yes, check out our LiveJournal community.
4194847	4195767	Just go to orangezontrade.com.
4195807	4197548	You're being immortalized in the sim file.
4197769	4198109	Exactly.
4198129	4198669	That's rad.
4198729	4199169	That is pretty.
4199550	4201871	And one of them is your song.
4201911	4202652	Yeah, I know.
4202712	4204693	And your name's on the background and everything.
4204893	4205394	It's pretty cool.
4205774	4207295	God damn, I feel important.
4208408	4216969	So yeah, that's pretty much all that's happened other than that DDRUK suffered a server crash.
4217410	4225351	But they say that they're pretty much done with the Ultramix 2 sim files and they should be released in a week or so, I think.
4225391	4226131	That's what I heard.
4227151	4232452	Because they're just finishing up the last bits of the beginner steps and that was pretty much all that was left.
4232812	4236953	So those should be coming out soon and DDR Maniacs is still down and
4239446	4240487	Yeah, I think that's pretty much it.
4241307	4243629	So, nothing really ain't going on.
4244129	4248371	Just a dead... Everyone's still kind of coming off the holiday.
4250753	4251113	So, yeah.
4253334	4253615	Angel?
4255176	4255776	Yeah, I can talk.
4255936	4256576	Okay, my bad.
4258477	4272441	Um, actually, that new skin thing, the Technofiend skin, the third one, uh, Mikey and I, uh, BigRedPimp in the chat room, uh, we decided to try playing that online mode this week.
4272481	4273262	That was pretty weird.
4274002	4275282	He kicked my butt twice.
4275382	4276102	How does that work?
4276162	4278483	I haven't really, um, tried the online mode.
4278543	4281244	Is it... You have to, like... Is it laggy, or does it... No.
4281284	4281504	Oh, really?
4281524	4281604	Yeah.
4282102	4283082	No, it's pretty good.
4284603	4290086	You have to put your own IP in it, and then you set up the server that way.
4290966	4295849	And then when people try to connect to it, they just put in your IP, and then it just works from there.
4296109	4296709	It's pretty cool.
4297469	4300391	There is a front end for all this, just so people know.
4300451	4300911	It's out there.
4300951	4305313	I can't remember the website, but there is a front end and an actual community base around it.
4305373	4307494	So if you search, you'll find it.
4309741	4310561	Yeah, it's in options.
4310701	4314183	Just go down to network and then, yeah.
4314223	4315663	It's pretty self-explanatory from there.
4316964	4317304	All right.
4319205	4322646	If that's it for the sim news, then I think we're going to have ourselves a cage match.
4322686	4323266	How's that sound?
4323286	4324167	Cage match.
4324287	4325247	All right, let's have a cage match.
4328160	4340725	Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, Loki put in the most panned song ever in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, getting a zero from every single person in the room, including himself.
4342106	4344027	Will he have his revenge this week?
4344187	4345227	We shall soon see.
4346928	4351990	The chatroom pick is now out because it got bumped out last week by Jamie's pick.
4352927	4362818	Which is a little song called Joe La Taxi And who knew that anybody liked anything French But our chat room apparently dug it It's like it's French as sung by a Japanese girl
4363174	4364735	Yeah, it's a cute song.
4364775	4365556	I'm kind of glad it won.
4365576	4366156	It was a cute one.
4366396	4366797	I like it.
4367097	4371480	And since the chatroom choice is out, it may come back.
4371600	4373962	That option may come back in a later week, but not tonight.
4374502	4377385	I'm coming back in with a choice of my own, and we shall see.
4377845	4392576	And I've decided just now, after seeing what all the songs are in Cage Match tonight, I've decided just now, I took a poll in the room about which song they wanted to see me put in Cage Match tonight, and I've decided to go against that and do what I feel like doing.
4393681	4399092	Well, I took a poll, too, to see what song I should put in Cage Match, and you picked this one, so... Ah!
4400074	4400515	I laughed.
4402475	4403255	Very interesting.
4403335	4407958	Alright, let's start off with a clip of last week's... Oh yes, a reminder on the way the cage match works.
4408438	4414180	It used to be songs that we think would be good in a DDR or other Bomani game, but now it's just kind of turned into whatever's cool.
4414621	4417842	Three songs, each host picks a song, puts it in the cage match.
4418362	4423505	You guys in the chat room, you have to be in the chat room to participate, www.orangehoundsradio.com, click on chat.
4424105	4436586	You guys in the chat room, vote for your favorite, and your favorite goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's 24-hour day, 7 days a week, Bomani Music and More program.
4438618	4439338	So let's have it.
4439739	4443241	First, you get a clip of last week's winner because you've already been hearing it all week long.
4443321	4443821	Here it is.
4444101	4445822	This is, and this is a long name.
4445862	4446943	I'm only going to say it once.
4447303	4451985	This is Aria Posey with Joe LaTaxi, the Jan Wayne remix radio cut.
4452045	4452866	It's last week's winner.
4453246	4454347	Joe LaTaxi for short.
4454807	4455047	Enjoy.
4548954	4550339	Thanks for watching!
4592501	4593782	Alright, that was song number one.
4594843	4597825	And I'm only going to read this one more time because somebody missed the name.
4598165	4598806	Pay attention.
4599486	4604269	Aurea Posey with Joe LaTaxi, the Jan Wayne remix radio cut.
4605370	4605871	There you go.
4606411	4607692	Let's move into song number two.
4607812	4609974	Song number two is Loki's pick tonight.
4611515	4612515	What did you pick, Loki?
4615297	4620081	Well, everyone in the studio here voted for the wild card song and
4620874	4621414	Guess what?
4622435	4631122	You see, last week I put in a song by a group called ProdigyRemix.com that's the Girls' Ideotech remix.
4631722	4634885	Well, you didn't like that too much.
4635265	4635866	So you know what?
4636066	4637146	I said, fuck it.
4637587	4639008	I don't give a shit what you like.
4639548	4640109	So you know what?
4640269	4641290	I put in the original.
4641370	4643231	So fucking, you get Girls again.
4643411	4647394	And if I can find a goddamn another remix of this song, I will put it in next week too.
4648275	4648815	So suck it.
4648915	4649436	Here's Girls.
4654887	4659190	Song number two, Prodigy with Girls and Joy.
4799108	4799809	Thank you for watching!
4885383	4886288	Thanks for watching!
4919493	4922074	Jamie, your thoughts?
4923815	4925275	I guess it didn't make it on the air.
4925556	4930677	So that last part, I'm like, if you'd like to take a phone call, please sign up and try it again.
4930997	4931818	Or deposit 25 cents.
4931918	4936059	I actually like that one a whole lot better.
4937440	4939381	But it has some annoying parts, so it gets like a 6.
4940881	4941261	Alright, 6.
4941421	4942382	It's not a 0.
4942942	4943442	6 from Jamie.
4943482	4944342	I'm actually surprised.
4944582	4945103	6 from Jamie.
4945863	4946163	Angel.
4946183	4946283	Angel.
4947771	4949352	I'm gonna be nice and give it a four.
4949412	4951674	It wasn't as bad as last week, so whatever.
4952815	4953335	Yeah, I know.
4953675	4953976	Shit.
4954276	4958099	Angel gives everything like a nine or a ten, and she gave that a four.
4958359	4959259	That's not nice.
4960740	4961941	It's better than zero.
4961961	4963002	Yeah, you got a point.
4963082	4963723	Alright, Loki.
4965124	4966865	It gets a girls, because...
4967529	4996026	I want everyone every time they hear the word girls to think of this song and it will be foreverly imprinted on your brain you'll never be able to forget the song no matter how bad it sucks it will just stick with you like the goddamn ketchup song and milkshake song it's just gonna it's just everybody's gonna hear girls and just think of that so it's gonna be brainwashed into your head anyways I give it a hundred because it's awesome
4996770	4999132	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5016562	5031135	and you put it in a nice shoebox and you put that shoebox in nice wrapping and then you paint it with glitter and then you tie it up in a nice little bow and then you put a little ribbon on it and it's a little sparkling and then you put, you know, you plate it in gold and then you cover it in money.
5031676	5034318	You still have dog shit!
5036720	5038802	But it wasn't as bad as last week so I give it a one.
5039543	5040924	That's more like a dog fart.
5041985	5042365	Alright.
5045131	5045591	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5063326	5064566	I'm going to go with this one.
5065107	5068628	I cannot let Prodigy win, so I've got to bring out the big guns.
5069248	5071288	And I truly think this is the better song.
5071348	5073209	It's one I've been listening to in my car all week.
5073629	5076730	It's a group called Flower Power is the name of the group.
5077230	5078891	And they have a guest singer on this one.
5079391	5080151	It's Danny Minow.
5080911	5081372	No!
5081632	5081872	Yes.
5082732	5082892	Yes.
5083254	5085095	Again, another Mario reference.
5085175	5086096	Please kill me.
5086516	5087056	Here we go.
5087476	5088697	This is Danny Minow.
5088837	5092999	I'm sorry, it's Flower Power featuring Danny Minow with a song called You Won't Forget About Me.
5093279	5093559	Enjoy.
5138728	5148683	I'm breathing in deep, let it go, now I don't know It's good to know, yeah it's good to know that you
5188744	5189505	Thank you.
5249251	5251113	Thanks for watching!
5321067	5321347	Oops.
5322668	5324188	You got a little bit of my next song in there.
5325469	5326249	That's for next week.
5326309	5326809	No, I'm kidding.
5328330	5331391	All right, that was Danny Minow with You Won't Forget About Me.
5332051	5336233	Let's see if we won't be able to forget that song or if we'd rather would forget it.
5336473	5336753	Jamie.
5337453	5338133	It wasn't bad.
5338193	5338734	It didn't suck.
5338774	5339314	It gets an eight.
5340294	5340614	Angel.
5342855	5343535	Ow.
5344156	5344736	It's Danny.
5345196	5346836	Nine.
5347717	5347997	Loki.
5350017	5351218	I forgot about the song.
5351638	5353200	I'm sorry, Danny Minow sucks.
5353960	5356022	It's just a fucking clone of Kylie Minow.
5356242	5357083	So, you know what?
5357904	5358364	I don't like it.
5358905	5359225	I'm sorry.
5359365	5359845	It's a four.
5362828	5364710	I like that song because it's very disco.
5365010	5366451	And it has a very catchy hook.
5366491	5369354	And I don't care if you didn't like it tonight, which most of you in the chatroom didn't.
5370034	5371716	You won't be able to forget that song come tomorrow.
5371736	5372897	You'll be thinking about that hook.
5374018	5375239	I promise you this.
5375739	5376440	I promise you...
5379110	5380971	We'll see, we'll see what they remember come tomorrow.
5381452	5383253	Alright guys, it's time to vote.
5385314	5391779	But after this quick recap of the songs you can vote for tonight, song number one, Joe LaTaxi.
5402727	5405289	Song number two, Prodigy with Girls.
5413780	5420125	And song number three you can vote for tonight is Flower Power featuring Danny Minow, You Won't Forget About Me.
5429431	5432474	Place, vote, now.
5432614	5441160	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote for either song number one, song number two, or song number three.
5442566	5443408	Don't vote for song number two.
5455450	5459951	and if this doesn't win, I have more girls to go in for next week.
5460731	5463392	Jamie, we need to institute some new rule against that.
5464512	5469473	Jamie, help me come up with a rule so Loki cannot put in another remix of Girls next week if he loses.
5470534	5472254	The other veto power.
5472974	5473635	The veto power?
5473655	5474255	The veto power.
5474335	5477615	Alright, veto power's in.
5478356	5479156	And let's take a vote.
5479216	5480976	Who votes that we do the veto power next week?
5481837	5483597	And who votes we don't do the veto power next week?
5484244	5484985	Oh shit!
5485005	5487547	Sucks to be you.
5489388	5493251	Although I actually kind of liked the original.
5494192	5497815	To Loki's credit, the original wasn't as bad as the one last week.
5498055	5498896	But it was still pretty bad.
5500231	5500491	All right.
5501052	5504454	I just... We've got to encourage Loki to expand his horizons.
5504834	5507196	But then he's just going to go and put echo image in or something.
5509158	5509558	We'll see.
5510879	5512340	We'll see what... Oh, and look at the chat room.
5512360	5513941	They're all raising their hands as well.
5514301	5515022	Too bad they don't get a vote.
5515402	5515722	All right.
5517304	5518104	We'll see what happens.
5518304	5518484	What?
5519205	5519825	They get a vote?
5520866	5521987	Yeah, they get their vote right now.
5522047	5523588	They're voting for their favorite song.
5523688	5526971	Either Joe LaTaxi or Girls or Danny.
5527031	5527451	We'll see.
5528332	5528632	All right.
5529463	5533045	Moving on, what else is going on in the gaming world right now?
5533365	5535886	You talked about that you'd actually played some Bomani this week, Jamie?
5536586	5537526	Just 2DX.
5538107	5540148	Oh, I thought you'd actually gone out to the arcade or something.
5540888	5541108	No.
5542909	5543749	I haven't had time.
5544209	5549211	You know, I want to go out to the arcade, but I can't get my motivation.
5549571	5552213	I've actually been tempted to re-download BM98.
5552993	5553413	Why's that?
5553673	5554654	Just because I miss it.
5554794	5555494	It feels fun.
5556912	5558212	What was so great about it?
5558232	5562813	Just the fact that you could... It was the Metal Gear song, but it had the whole first level of Metal Gear.
5565574	5565894	Alright.
5569535	5572036	I need to go out to the arcade sometime this week and play some DDR.
5572056	5573636	We should have like a DDR night or something.
5574996	5575816	I know, I know.
5577437	5577977	Alright, well...
5578991	5580912	G, I guess we're going to take a break.
5580992	5583894	And when we come back from the break, we'll find out who won Cage Match.
5584214	5587276	And we will have ourselves a list list for this evening.
5587356	5588396	So be thinking about that.
5590317	5590537	Rob.
5590717	5590898	Yes.
5591098	5591278	Rob.
5591378	5591538	Yes.
5591838	5591998	What?
5592098	5592238	Rob.
5592278	5592418	What?
5592438	5592578	Rob.
5592638	5592739	Hi.
5592759	5592939	Hi.
5592999	5593459	All right.
5603877	5606958	We're going to take a break when we come back to tonight's version of Listless.
5607418	5619660	And if you guys would like to start making suggestions for tonight's Listless, tonight's Listless topic is video game we would most like to see in 2005.
5620860	5625181	Now that doesn't mean it has to actually be a game that has been announced, although it could be.
5625761	5626661	You could make something up.
5626961	5631002	But just video game I most want to see so I can buy it in 2005.
5631042	5631902	That's tonight's topic.
5632719	5639708	When we come back from this break of music featuring songs from DDR Solo, because I just want an excuse to play Temple of Love.
5641310	5643393	So we'll be back after this.
5644054	5644375	Enjoy.
5646237	5647679	And don't forget, vote on tonight's cage match.
5655442	5668859	You hear the priest that's trying to keep his god asleep Love's shining eternally, love will make you feel so free Come on girl, it's okay for satisfaction You must break the flame of passion In the blood that's shining in the temple of love
5698300	5699181	Thank you for watching!
5763479	5764220	Thanks for watching!
5838367	5842482	Let's dream a dream together A dream that is real
5969223	5969944	I wanna rock!
6008570	6009531	Gaming Radio.
6009751	6017055	So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
6017215	6018555	Orange Lounge Radio.
6023758	6025739	We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
6028161	6029061	Tom Brokaw, our buddy.
6029882	6031082	We miss him already, don't we?
6031122	6032443	That other guy is not quite as cool.
6032963	6033263	Yeah.
6033604	6036025	Alright, you guys ready to hear who won tonight's cage match?
6036045	6037726	Sure.
6037746	6037926	Alright.
6037946	6038026	Sure.
6038424	6041746	I'll tell you what guys, it was a landslide vote.
6042387	6048090	Every song got a couple of votes, but tonight's winner was an absolute landslide.
6048190	6051312	Getting twice as many votes as the other two songs combined.
6052413	6053694	What do you think?
6053934	6055395	All that being said, who do you think won it?
6057436	6058377	Loki says my song.
6058397	6059037	What do you think, Jamie?
6059577	6060238	I think I don't care.
6060598	6061138	I think you don't care.
6061158	6061759	What do you think, Loki?
6062639	6063700	I already told you I thought.
6063820	6064440	Oh yeah, just kidding.
6064540	6065201	Angel, what do you think?
6067226	6068406	I already know, so I can't say.
6070108	6073350	I guess I'll say... Oh, God.
6073750	6076252	It's either a toss-up between Jamie's or yours.
6076593	6077433	Alright, well, let's see.
6077533	6081816	Tonight's cage match winner is... Dome of Taxi!
6081917	6083218	Holy shit!
6083398	6083858	Cool!
6085439	6087160	I actually kind of thought it would be yours.
6087461	6089983	Blew the other two songs out of the freaking water.
6091784	6093205	Got two more where that came from, baby.
6093584	6094786	Well, thank you, chat room.
6094806	6095627	You really love me.
6096027	6096989	Alright.
6097389	6101374	Actually, I'm not so sure if it's that they love you as they hated the other two songs.
6101394	6102836	Well, I know your song was kind of cool.
6102916	6103517	I liked it.
6103637	6103958	Alright.
6105219	6107783	Alright, so Jolitaxi wins it two weeks in a row.
6109048	6109408	Alright.
6110029	6111250	Loki's going to keep trying, though.
6111290	6114152	He wants to put girls up again next week, so we'll see what happens.
6114612	6116333	I'm going to tell you, you're going to keep losing, too.
6117254	6119435	Yet another week I don't have to pick a song.
6119615	6120596	Thank you, everybody.
6121717	6126560	We haven't had a two-week winner since, well, Gwen Stefani wasn't that long ago, I suppose.
6127180	6128661	That was the last song we had to retire.
6130390	6130890	Alright, alright.
6131531	6134272	Let's get into tonight's list list.
6134352	6148300	Now, let's explain the way list list works, because I know a lot of you guys are new to Orange Lounge Radio, whether it be through the DDR Freak repeats, which are on Friday nights at 6 o'clock, if you ever miss this show, by the way, on DDR Freak Radio, or through the podcast.
6148700	6150981	So it's very possible you haven't heard list list before.
6151041	6151862	Basically what we do...
6152617	6154458	Thank you for watching!
6171678	6177759	So tonight's list is going to be video game you most want to see in 2005.
6178099	6180079	And this can be something that's already been announced.
6180620	6184960	This could be something that you just dream about.
6185660	6186901	It could be just about anything.
6186921	6188541	We're really not setting any limits on this.
6188601	6190241	So let's see what everybody comes up with.
6191041	6196042	But in order to do list list properly, we have to bring in our game show announcer and our game show music.
6196082	6197382	So you guys ready to do some list list?
6197802	6198022	What?
6198323	6198663	Sure.
6199123	6199603	What was that?
6199743	6200143	Nothing.
6200583	6201103	All right, here we go.
6201670	6203211	Let's bring in our game show announcer.
6222825	6224266	That's right, everybody.
6224806	6227348	It's time to play Listless.
6228129	6233212	Remember, in order to participate in the listless segment, you have to be in our chat room!
6234033	6246181	www.orangelearnradio.com Tonight, we're going to come up with the definitive list for a video game we most want to see in 2005!
6247161	6252225	Helping us come up with tonight's list, say hello to DarkSakura!
6253145	6253746	Hi!
6255172	6259135	And say hello to the inventor of Rice-A-Roni, Loki!
6260756	6261616	Uh, no.
6263357	6267040	Also helping us out, say hello to DDRangel!
6267300	6267740	Hello.
6269641	6271442	And say hello to Skye!
6271943	6272243	Hi.
6273384	6274544	Hey, Mr. Announcer!
6274825	6276446	Yes, DarkSakura!
6277206	6279748	Did you ever get this shoe removed from your butt?
6280914	6283136	I have no idea what you're talking about!
6305788	6306808	Why the hell not?
6306848	6308989	You always start off these segments, so why not?
6309049	6309709	Why the hell not?
6309749	6311710	You're number three pick.
6312370	6313691	Pimp My Ride the game.
6314931	6323894	After all, you know, and all of those racing games they have where you can customize your car and everything, they just need a game of nothing but that, because that's the most fun.
6324954	6326275	Pimp My Ride the game.
6326335	6327895	Pimp My Ride the game.
6327955	6328916	That's pretty creative.
6328936	6329716	I've got to give that to you.
6329736	6330216	That's good.
6330716	6331096	All right.
6331656	6333077	Loki, you're number three pick.
6335492	6337933	This one just came to me now, just like an epiphany.
6339433	6349657	This one is going to have similar gameplay to Katamari Damacy.
6351237	6356819	I think it would be very popular because everybody has these, they can identify with them.
6357739	6360480	It's Roll My SUV The Game.
6364704	6366866	Because, you know, those SUVs, they like to roll.
6368727	6370889	I don't get it or something.
6370909	6374552	Can you explain the joke, please, for the mentally challenged such as myself?
6375673	6386643	Giant fucking vehicles that have no point in being on a road, and people drive them around like they're race cars, and well, since they have a high center of balance, they tend to roll.
6387424	6391467	Like, as in flip over, as in crash, explode, people die.
6391687	6392288	Sounds like Burnout 3.
6393902	6394682	Sounds like Driver 3.
6395643	6397923	Angel, your number three pick, please.
6398083	6407806	I was going to say Actraiser DS just because I was being serious, but I think I need to steal K-Dash's suggestion, which was DDR Dimash.
6409487	6410407	Because it sounded funny.
6411447	6413928	And how exactly does DDR Dimash work?
6415029	6417509	I have no idea, but it sounded funny at the time.
6417629	6418230	So you know what?
6418270	6419550	He gets a cookie for that one.
6421084	6421964	Alright, fair enough.
6422524	6426286	My number three pick, I actually went with a serious one, heaven forbid.
6426846	6429646	This is a game that has needed to come out for about the past ten years.
6430527	6431227	Kid Icarus 2005.
6431447	6433348	Holy shit, yeah.
6437149	6439489	I seriously, seriously don't get it.
6439829	6448212	Nintendo has this character, many people still know this character and love this character, and yet this character is yet to turn up in any type of Super Smash Bros.
6448232	6448952	game or anything.
6449617	6450177	What the hell?
6450297	6452498	They could do a kick-ass game with Kid Icarus.
6452738	6454378	Maybe the next Animal Crossing?
6456098	6456438	I don't know.
6456478	6456919	We'll see.
6457199	6458139	We will see what happens.
6459119	6459539	Alright.
6461019	6461600	Moving on.
6462380	6463500	Number two pick time.
6464160	6465440	Jamie, your number two pick, please.
6466561	6468001	The Sims, Sims in the Hood.
6468961	6470582	The Sims, Sims in the Hood.
6471502	6472702	I'm not meaning like the herbs.
6472882	6476683	I mean like we have ghetto Sims that have to go pick up their cheese.
6479821	6485125	And I'm going to spell that Sims with a Z. Oh, I did too.
6485665	6486146	Okay, good.
6486226	6486566	All right.
6487687	6488568	Sims in the hood.
6490229	6491570	Loki, your number two pick, please.
6492390	6494152	This one's a request by Nelly.
6494232	6496373	She wants the girl game.
6497334	6501617	Much like the guy game, but, you know, no breasts and more cock shots.
6503018	6507081	You know, funny you should mention this, because something similar is going to come up on my list, but we'll see.
6508082	6509303	Angel, your number two pick.
6510127	6515892	You know, I was just looking at the poster over there and I just had to giggle at myself because I just picked something completely at random.
6517033	6519275	Except I don't know if I want to call it one thing or the other.
6519395	6525740	Okay, I was either going to say Kill Bill Online or something just because I was just being completely random.
6525860	6527801	So Kill Bill the game or Kill Bill Online?
6530083	6530303	Oops.
6530664	6531824	Uh oh.
6531925	6533626	I'm sorry.
6533646	6534847	I have to think of something new now.
6535027	6535968	I had Kill Bill the RPG.
6536974	6538274	That would have been cooler, see?
6538394	6539535	You still would have gotten props from me.
6539555	6541355	So do you want Kill Bill the RPG Angel?
6541835	6542056	Yeah.
6542616	6545217	Alright, and she just stole Jamie's just like that.
6545837	6546457	What a bitch.
6546477	6547257	I hate you.
6547377	6547797	Alright.
6549458	6551879	My number two pick is another serious one.
6553099	6553839	Heaven forbid.
6554599	6559141	I would like to see a true sequel to Castlevania Symphony of the Night.
6559561	6561421	And I'm not talking those 3D bullshit.
6561561	6561982	I want a 2D...
6564028	6571569	Beautiful, I don't care what they do, I want a 2D Castlevania game that just fucking sleeps with me, it's that good.
6572750	6574870	So I'm going to call it Castlevania Symphony of the Night 2.
6576750	6578111	I'm done, actually.
6578291	6579011	Announce for the DC.
6580651	6580891	Yes.
6581931	6586092	Then that is the game I most, no, okay, then I'm going to be specific.
6586712	6588132	On PS2.
6588592	6590273	I'm sick of this handheld bullshit.
6590353	6591353	I want one on a console.
6592673	6594374	Put it on a good system and put it on the Xbox.
6594614	6595735	So it'll actually look good.
6596435	6597036	I don't give a shit.
6597116	6597616	I just want it.
6597836	6599617	I don't want it on a freaking handheld.
6599657	6606201	I want it on the big TV so I can turn up the speakers and blast the shit out of the Castlevania music.
6608762	6609422	Anyway, moving on.
6611083	6612924	Jamie, did you manage to find a new number one?
6613265	6614065	Yeah, I guess so.
6614145	6615246	Okay, what is your new number one?
6615806	6617087	Console Ragnarok Online.
6618327	6619328	Fully customizable.
6623027	6625048	Ragnarok Online to your console.
6625328	6625728	Beautiful.
6626989	6627969	Angel, you're number one.
6628869	6629390	You don't have one.
6629490	6630750	Oh, sorry, Loki, you're number one.
6632531	6633071	Oh, man.
6635252	6635772	Let's see.
6635812	6637233	What would be a good game?
6640314	6641334	I know, I know, I know.
6641955	6643395	Well, let's... No, actually, that's going to suck.
6643415	6645536	You're supposed to prep these.
6646316	6646876	You know what?
6647597	6648117	God damn it.
6648641	6649281	How about this?
6649341	6650441	This is going to be my game.
6650481	6653302	It's called Get Off Your Ass and Get a Job, the game.
6655483	6661184	This will teach those fat fuckers that play games all the time to fucking get off their ass, go outside and get a job.
6661244	6663705	And provide for your family.
6666105	6670026	It's not about leveling your fucking character, it's about getting a goddamn job.
6670466	6671226	That's what it's about.
6671967	6675167	Seriously, who gives a shit if you're a level 50 monk?
6675707	6677988	You need to be earning some fucking cash.
6679711	6684815	You're going to have a family out there and just because you can slay dragons doesn't mean you can fucking provide.
6685416	6686657	So get a fucking job.
6686737	6687217	That's it.
6688338	6688779	That's my game.
6690300	6691321	Get out and get a job.
6691361	6691821	The game.
6692222	6692582	Lovely.
6694203	6697166	I wrote it down as get out and get a job.
6697206	6698687	You want get out and get a fucking job?
6700288	6701990	There are plenty of people who would like a job fucking.
6702030	6702330	Thank you.
6704452	6706674	Now the ESRB may have problems with this.
6708635	6718183	That's why they put it out on Xbox Alright, get up off your ass and get a fucking job the game, alright Uh, Angel, did you come up with the new number one over there?
6718983	6737918	Alright, Angel's number one Yeah, except I can't think of a city that I wanted to put in the name Happy Bunny Kills Everything, insert city name here Happy Bunny Kills Everything, the game Yes, I was trying to be random, leave me alone We're just gonna call it Happy Bunny Kills Everything, how's that?
6739238	6743481	And Angel, for those that may not know, what is Happy Bunny?
6744462	6745143	What is Happy Bunny?
6745383	6746264	My personal avatar.
6747384	6749066	Let Jamie do it because Jamie's cooler.
6749766	6750067	Jamie?
6751728	6758193	I believe that my favorite Happy Bunny line is this cute little bunny you see just looking all happy, all sweet and everything.
6758573	6762456	My favorite one is, school prepares you for the real world, which also sucks.
6763857	6768361	Or my other favorite one is, you icky people are nice, but you gotta go.
6769548	6773051	Don't you think that Happy Bunny sold out a little bit thanks to Hot Topic?
6773872	6775653	A little, but Happy Bunny's still cool.
6775753	6777695	All right, all right.
6777895	6784701	And the last one is my number one pick, and it's very similar to one that Loki put in earlier, but I had a different idea.
6785461	6787083	You guys know the guy game, right?
6787463	6793768	Well, we need a game that caters to the other percentage of the male population, the gay guy game, and that is my number one pick.
6797612	6797932	All right.
6799364	6801786	Now it's time for the elimination round.
6802586	6804728	Let's read the list that we have so far.
6804888	6810412	Each host will have to eliminate one song forever off of this list.
6810452	6810872	Here we go.
6810992	6813374	We have... What?
6814054	6814775	Not a song.
6814835	6815255	No, you're right.
6815275	6815896	It's not a song.
6815936	6817577	It's an item from the list.
6817617	6818097	Here we go.
6819878	6820519	Number one.
6821179	6823501	I'm sorry, not number one, but first item on the list.
6823621	6825182	Pimp My Ride, the game.
6826103	6827604	Roll My SUV, the game.
6828365	6851155	DDR Dimashy, Kid Icarus 2005, The Sims, Sims and the Hood, The Girl Game, Kill Bill, the RPG, Castlevania Symphony of the Night 2, console please, Console Ragnarok Online, Get Up Off Your Ass and Get a Fucking Job, the game, Happy Bunny Kills Everything, and the Gay Guy game.
6852776	6853756	Alright, Jamie?
6853776	6853876	Jamie?
6854901	6856422	You get the first elimination.
6856462	6863367	What's coming off the list?
6863747	6873614	I think that I'm going to have to kick off... Goddamn.
6873654	6875436	Get off your ass and get a fucking job at the game.
6875636	6876136	Really?
6877357	6878938	Oh, I would have thought this would have been your anthem.
6879018	6881140	It's sort of defeating the purpose.
6882714	6886417	You could play about getting a fucking job, but you could get a fucking job.
6888679	6890180	So, yeah, defeat the purpose.
6890280	6891101	Alright, Loki.
6893563	6899408	I'm going to have to take off Ragnarok Online, the console game, because that game sucks and doesn't deserve to be on console.
6900068	6901469	It's made by Koreans.
6901589	6904972	Oh, the same can be said about Final Fantasy XI, which also sucks.
6906213	6907714	Yeah, but that's on a console already.
6907874	6908395	D'oh!
6908951	6909772	Yeah, and it still sucks.
6909812	6911493	Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.
6911933	6913094	Ooh, take it outside.
6913134	6914194	Let's put it on webcam.
6914395	6915415	Kick the shit out of each other.
6915775	6917397	I don't go on webcam, and I would win.
6917617	6919858	All right.
6920058	6920719	Angel, your turn.
6920799	6921279	One's got to go.
6923941	6925382	I was going to pick my own, but never mind.
6925562	6927143	I'll just do Roll My SUV, the game.
6927163	6928604	Sorry, Loki.
6928624	6929845	Roll My SUV, the game.
6929865	6930185	You know what?
6930225	6932106	I was looking at that one, too, because I didn't get the joke either.
6932726	6936289	And I'm going to... I know, I get it.
6936469	6936489	I...
6937362	6946208	I will eliminate DDR Dimashy with respect to our chatroom because I know it was their idea, but I'm just not sure how to spell Dimashy, and I'm not going to make an ass out of myself.
6946969	6947989	It's okay, Rob.
6951012	6954874	All right, so we have a final list here, and you guys get to place your vote.
6955214	6960238	Let's bring back our own version of Don Pardo to read the choices you have to pick from.
6964199	6965000	That's right!
6965381	6971350	Here are the choices that you get to vote from tonight for video game you most want to see in 2005!
6971670	6972892	Pimp My Ride!
6972912	6974194	The Game!
6976949	6995319	Kid Icarus 2005, The Sims, Sims Into Hood, The Girl Game, Kill Bill, The RPG, Castlevania Symphony of the Night 2, Happy Bunny Kills Everything, and The Gay Guy Game!
6998100	6998700	Alright!
6999921	7001242	Thank you for playing!
7003363	7003643	Alright.
7004457	7005117	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7033226	7034447	and allow folks to call in.
7035367	7039469	And we'll also get into... What else were we going to do?
7039509	7040729	Oh, we have to do the FUs of the week.
7040989	7042150	But don't send those in just yet.
7042190	7043930	I want votes for listless first.
7044571	7046612	And then, I don't know.
7046992	7047632	We'll see what else.
7047792	7051894	But we're going to let you guys call in the Skype line when we come back about whatever you want.
7052494	7055995	If you don't know what the Skype line is all about, www.orangeonstrider.com.
7056015	7057196	Click on Interact With Us.
7057896	7062298	Meanwhile, we're going to go to a break featuring Utter Randomness from Bomani.
7062776	7063296	We'll be back.
7071542	7072263	We'll be back.
7086795	7087816	DarkSakura.com

7375492	7383788	Close your eyes Close your eyes and let us fly You and I
7385714	7411546	Together we can touch the sky I was walking down the street You came like a summer breeze Sweeping my breath away It doesn't happen every day You and I together in the sky Forever young, we can never die DarkSakura
7416138	7417861	Thank you for watching!
7441550	7448474	Close your eyes and let us fly, you and I, together we can touch the sky.
7481916	7491267	And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.
7492015	7496097	Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.
7496118	7497078	Can we talk about that?
7497358	7499700	No subject will ever be taboo.
7500000	7503642	Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.
7504162	7506684	Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.
7507204	7512547	Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?
7513107	7514388	I collect your fucking head.
7516337	7517858	Just like this fucker here.
7518938	7522621	Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?
7522901	7526283	The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!
7527223	7533667	Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!
7534867	7538669	Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.
7542892	7544953	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and...
7545615	7551398	We're about ready to reveal the winners of tonight's list list, the definitive list of games we most want to see in 2005.
7552318	7558241	It's very funny, though, because the chat room was just going off on these ideas about Orange Lounge Radio, the game.
7559541	7562402	Phoenix in the chat room says, Orange Lounge Radio, the game.
7562442	7572627	You could be one of the broadcasters, and then if Loki says something retarded or votes for a bad song, he would promptly be shot with an RPG or a large rifle.
7572707	7574208	Failure to do so will cause you to lose.
7574248	7575008	Hey, I like that idea.
7577168	7579029	And let's see, what else is it?
7579129	7584891	Jaded2005 says, make it an RPG where you guide the Orange Lawns Radio guys to the studio before the show starts.
7585291	7587292	K-Dash says, make sure they get there before 6.
7588092	7588312	Ha!
7589073	7594655	More like real life, make it before they get here by 6.32, because that's about what time they usually get here.
7595475	7596035	Hardy har.
7597696	7598396	Ah, funny stuff.
7599710	7603832	BlackDevilerX says, Orange Lens Radio, the game definitely belongs on the PlayStation 2.
7604532	7608434	Yes, so we can be badly anti-alias just like all the rest of the games on PS2.
7608474	7609055	That'd be great.
7609255	7610975	We could look very pixelated on the edges.
7611236	7611676	Be hot.
7612396	7612836	Can't wait.
7614317	7616678	DarkSakura, what do you think of Orange Lens Radio, the game?
7616718	7617639	I don't care.
7617679	7618339	Get with the show.
7621260	7625582	I think that I would have to go around with hammers hitting people in the head with them in the game.
7626403	7626703	Love you.
7627773	7629054	Okay, you can go back to the wedding talk now.
7629074	7629634	Girl talk.
7630475	7631655	With the silent Nelly.
7632396	7632616	Angel?
7632776	7634497	Does that mean I can kill everybody with halos?
7634537	7635317	Oops, did I say that?
7636818	7637579	And stuff.
7638699	7639400	Yeah, I'm not funny.
7639720	7640200	Okay, bye.
7641521	7647605	Alright, let's get into tonight's winners from Listless.
7650787	7651627	Alright!
7652948	7656230	And now it's time to reveal the top three...
7657515	7686703	Games we most want to see in 2005 Number 3 Kid Icarus 2005 Number 2 Happy Bunny Kills Everything And the number 1 game we most want to see in 2005 Kill Bill The RPG I'm taking half credit for that, you know You should, you should
7687558	7690019	Go ahead.
7690059	7690779	There it is.
7691559	7693260	The definitive list.
7694280	7701582	As pissed off as this chat room is that I took off DDR Dimashy, and they're saying, Sky's an idiot if he can't spell Dimashy.
7701642	7703502	He's an idiot for taking us off the list.
7703522	7704363	You idiot!
7705443	7706583	Well, you know what?
7706823	7707583	I just didn't get it.
7707663	7707964	Sorry.
7707984	7711244	Katamari Dimashy 2 coming out this year, so shut up.
7711745	7712405	Exactly.
7712685	7714645	You're getting Katamari Dimashy 2, so shut up.
7715426	7715766	Alright.
7719557	7723199	As I promised, we're going to go over and open up the Skype line.
7723479	7728321	So if you want to call in on the Skype line, we will basically take your calls about just about anything.
7729041	7734023	www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on interact with us.
7734103	7735804	And look, the chat room is going off again.
7735864	7737465	It says, you didn't get it?
7737845	7739065	What's wrong with you?
7739625	7741646	I think they're just making fun of me.
7741686	7742026	I don't know.
7743167	7743807	All right, let's see.
7743827	7744688	We're going to take a call.
7746068	7747869	Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
7749093	7750795	Hello Sky, it's Elmullet again.
7750895	7752817	Hello Elmullet, how are you my friend?
7753397	7755419	I am doing good Sky, how about yourself?
7755559	7756780	Good, long time no talk?
7757561	7762506	Yeah, long time no listen, I just got... As with most people, it's alright.
7763987	7766409	I take my sabbaticals from things every now and then.
7766710	7767891	It's okay, it's alright.
7767931	7770133	Well, what's new in the Elmullet world?
7772008	7776131	Well, in the Elmullet world, I've recently restarted Encore Extra Stage.
7776151	7778332	You will be receiving your weekly plug as always.
7778573	7778913	Hot!
7780814	7784757	And I've been, I've actually gone a bit mainstream.
7784817	7788980	I can't stop playing Grand Theft Auto 3, I mean, San Andreas for some reason.
7789800	7791161	Because you like the N-word?
7791221	7793703	Because that's about the only reason I can see to keep playing that game.
7794403	7794704	No, I'm kidding.
7794724	7796045	Yes, the N-word is funny.
7796285	7797746	I can't quote half the game.
7798346	7802649	Alright, Loki, you were playing San Andreas for a while, but you stopped.
7802689	7803429	What happened, Loki?
7804390	7804810	Oh, fancy.
7806151	7808153	Exactly, exactly.
7809533	7813396	No, seriously, in all seriousness, what is it about San Andreas that's drawing you to that game?
7814364	7815725	I really don't know what it is.
7815925	7819508	I mean, for some reason, I like the Grand Theft Auto formula.
7819708	7821510	I like the basic gameplay about it.
7821930	7826674	And this one actually has a good story that goes along with it.
7827675	7829136	It's a very compelling one.
7829316	7833219	It relies mostly on gang warfare than mob warfare.
7834881	7836302	And the story is pretty well done.
7837017	7842818	You know what I like about the Grand Theft Auto games is the fact that you can kind of just go around anywhere and do anything.
7843178	7846419	You don't really have to go and follow along the story if you want.
7846539	7848479	I mean, sure, it'll open up new areas and new stuff.
7849199	7855200	But hell, put in the cheat codes and you can do whatever the hell you want and you can start blowing away people with rockets and start running from the police.
7855501	7857761	That's my favorite part of the game is running away from the police.
7858881	7859501	Me personally.
7861082	7863222	So what did you think of the list there that we came up with?
7864344	7864845	I liked it.
7864865	7866447	I liked the list.
7866627	7867808	Kid Icarus made it on there.
7867968	7870251	Any particular game you think should have been on the list that wasn't?
7872133	7875738	I can't really think of any one specifically.
7876756	7883398	I had Beatmania 2DX USA on there because I do think that they should come out with a 2DX USA.
7885699	7900123	Truthfully, it looks as though an American release of a 2DX or something along those lines is a bit more realized than it would be, say, like a year ago because all of a sudden we see all these music games coming out in the U.S.,
7900683	7916890	With their various controllers, we have a Donkey Konga, we have Taiko, Notatsujin, and it seems as though that if these things are really taking off, it would give Konami more incentive to look into porting some of their other Bimani over here.
7917702	7918262	I hope so.
7918482	7919723	I hope it's being incentive for them.
7919763	7920643	I guess we'll find out.
7920723	7924745	I'm hoping that we're in for a treat at E3 this year, but I'm not going to hold my breath either.
7925145	7931648	I'm expecting to see Karaoke Revolution 4, Extreme 2, and Ultramix 3, which honestly wouldn't be a bad lineup.
7931688	7932308	Don't get me wrong.
7932388	7934649	I mean, they have to do an Ultramix 3.
7934749	7935129	Have to.
7935350	7935790	No choice.
7937430	7938631	Ultramix 2 is the best.
7938691	7938951	Do you?
7940172	7940892	I highly agree.
7941851	7944912	So you were mentioning your column, which is Encore Extra Stage.
7944972	7948933	I will give you a chance to plug it, since you plug us so kindly in your column.
7949093	7950853	Let the listeners know where they can read your column.
7951733	7965896	Go to www.insidepulse.com or to go directly to my section, games.insidepulse.com I have a Friday column, Encore Extra Stage.
7966877	7968017	It's numbered and everything.
7970261	7971582	And it's a pretty good read.
7971722	7972762	Pretty good read indeed.
7972902	7973823	It's a mediocre read.
7973883	7974403	No, I'm kidding.
7974423	7975103	It's a very good read.
7975163	7977284	Thank you, Scott.
7977584	7978224	Anytime.
7978284	7978664	Anytime.
7978904	7979645	It's okay.
7980065	7986187	I mean, I guess if I'm done looking at porn, it's something I can go look at, you know, while I'm kind of coming down.
7986207	7987228	That's the majority of my fan base.
7987428	7988608	Stinky-fingered porn watchers.
7991649	7992430	Hey, same thing.
7992610	7993150	Hey, you know what?
7993170	7995771	We have people that listen to this show while looking at porn.
7995851	7996471	So, you know...
7999167	8014957	I don't know how people could listen to this show while looking at porn, because I think listening to this show would just be... I can just see them, all of a sudden, Loki's face appearing on a girl's body.
8015838	8016939	What else was I going to say?
8017139	8019900	Over on Inside Pulse, you guys do a lot of game reviews, right?
8020141	8021822	Not just you, but the other folks over there, right?
8022362	8023863	Oh, yeah.
8024063	8025684	Did you guys do any sort of top 2004 list?
8028002	8030703	We did a 2004 awards segment, actually.
8030843	8033864	And what was the best game of 2004?
8035244	8036644	Best game of 2004?
8037485	8038905	Give me a second, let me look it up.
8039005	8041226	It's been a tiny bit since I started.
8044267	8045987	How about you personally, while you're looking?
8047207	8048028	Me personally?
8048108	8053809	I guess it would be a tie in between Katamari Damacy and Pokemon FireRedLeafGreen.
8054449	8054770	Really?
8054790	8056410	You liked Pokemon that much, huh?
8057173	8060535	I'm a Pokemon fan, to be brutally honest with you.
8061336	8063337	I've been a fan since the Red Blue days.
8063778	8065299	It's a very engrossing game.
8066099	8071984	I love the fact that it's freeform after you go through all the main quests.
8072604	8076227	I thought it was good, but I don't know if I could name it Best of 2004.
8077067	8078448	To each their own.
8078688	8079069	Loki!
8079749	8081010	I have my nomination for Best of 2004.
8081050	8084573	Actually, I guess it would be kind of Best of 2005, but it started in 2004.
8085751	8089213	It would be Gary's Mod, version 5 for Half-Life 2.
8090914	8091314	Why?
8092055	8092435	Why?
8093135	8095977	Because you can pose people and make funny pictures.
8096237	8102701	For instance, they have, and you can find this all at www.gary.tv slash Gary's Mod.
8103562	8105122	Oh, the one with the baby launcher.
8105743	8106743	Yes, exactly.
8107224	8111066	It says you can string up a combine soldier and fire dead babies at him.
8112072	8113233	And there's the dead babies.
8113573	8118857	And there's also one that says, position ragdolls so they look like they've had a baby.
8121659	8122580	It's just so much fun.
8122680	8124721	This is like, this is what we need.
8126002	8128884	Only you would vote for the game with the dead baby launcher.
8129164	8130946	I'd vote for a game with a dead baby launcher.
8130966	8131906	That's pretty cool.
8132207	8133568	Post that link in our chat if you can.
8133588	8134528	I can't get it.
8134648	8135449	All right, all right, all right.
8136334	8137955	I'm sorry, Mullet, we forgot all about you.
8138095	8140916	And that game that you guys, you were looking at there?
8142237	8144838	Best of 2004, according to the Inside Pulse, folks?
8144918	8147279	Inside Pulse, it was Katamari Damacy.
8147719	8148540	I'm not surprised.
8149240	8151821	With GTA SA following up as runner-up.
8152381	8153422	I'm also not surprised.
8153762	8160365	Now, wait, I'm kind of surprised that Halo 2 isn't mentioned there somewhere, but you're a very anti-Halo kind of guy, if I remember right, right?
8161365	8164427	Yeah, mostly because of the fucking hype.
8164447	8164667	Yeah.
8165163	8166624	The hype killed the game.
8166644	8167044	Wait, what?
8167104	8167745	I don't have Halo 2 yet.
8167765	8170667	I don't even play it, but I have a character made for it.
8188917	8190018	I just think it's kind of interesting.
8190459	8192160	What about the hype ruined the game?
8192220	8198486	Just the fact that, you know, it was the overnight people waiting out in line or just the... Oh, not even that.
8198526	8200107	We're talking about a year ago.
8200247	8204651	It was named best game on the Xbox without anybody playing it.
8204972	8205212	Yeah.
8205932	8206113	You know...
8207240	8211102	I'll tell you what bugged me about Halo 2 was the fact... I mean, I love Halo 2.
8211402	8212162	It's an awesome game.
8212182	8213383	Me, personally, I love it.
8214063	8215964	I do agree the hype was a little bit much.
8216024	8217545	Here's my biggest problem with Halo 2.
8218225	8224888	It was Halo 1 with Xbox Live and a kind of better story mode, a more theatric story mode.
8225169	8225529	No way.
8225589	8227850	It had the flying things, but...
8228720	8229440	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8248069	8249329	with his Inviso armor.
8249690	8255912	No, I don't want the Halo fans sending me a nasty gram going, you faggot, why don't you like the Halo games?
8255932	8256672	What is wrong with you?
8257012	8258253	Okay, I bought Halo.
8258453	8259493	I like Halo.
8259813	8260233	Like.
8260894	8261274	Like.
8261614	8262614	I just don't love it.
8263855	8271397	The Arbiter's level, though, is really aggravating because you don't know who you're trying to kill because they're all freaking Covenant guys.
8272018	8272258	I know.
8272438	8272978	It's confusing.
8273618	8273878	All right.
8274879	8275699	And then I get motion sick.
8277258	8279580	Any other thoughts, Mullet, on gaming?
8279680	8281401	What's going on right now or anything in general?
8281421	8290148	Well, actually, going on to gaming cults and people emailing you going, you're an idiot if you don't like this, that, and the other thing.
8290548	8294651	I got my first In The Groove fanboy email.
8294991	8295612	Ooh, goody!
8296232	8297674	I haven't gotten any of those yet.
8298034	8299975	Rob at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
8301084	8302605	In the Groove is not that great.
8302865	8304305	Send your emails away, okay?
8304525	8305065	There you go.
8305265	8305686	I said it.
8306406	8312208	I personally can't comment on the game because there is no machine within a 500 mile radius of my house.
8312328	8312628	Yikes.
8313548	8320951	But the guy emails my cookie column, which I wrote five months ago, and takes it completely out of context.
8321191	8325332	Oh boy, you think they put in Moonlight Shadow because of your suggestion?
8325412	8326473	You are selfish.
8326613	8327653	In the Groove rocks.
8330215	8331936	Are you going to respond to it in your next column?
8332816	8337977	I've already responded it to him, and I'm going to print it up front and center in the next column, pretty much.
8338137	8338957	Can't wait!
8339857	8340297	Can't wait.
8342418	8343278	Silly fanboys.
8343458	8352880	Alright, but if you do want to send fanboy or fangirl mail to Orange Lounge Radio, you can send it to either Rob at Orange Lounge Radio, Jamie at Orange Lounge Radio, or Loki at Orange Lounge Radio.
8352920	8355301	We all have those addresses, so have fun.
8356581	8356861	Alright.
8357502	8359302	Anything else you want to share, Al Mullet, before I hang up on you?
8360270	8361772	You can go ahead and hang up now.
8361852	8362493	All right.
8362633	8363294	Have a good one, Mullen.
8363314	8363814	Thanks for calling.
8365832	8366432	I cut him off.
8366472	8367132	I'm so rude.
8367812	8368453	I didn't mean to.
8368673	8369073	I'm sorry.
8369413	8373494	Alright, we're going to keep the Skype line open if anybody else wants to call in.
8373834	8378775	As much as we enjoy El Mullet and talking to him on the show, I had to let him go because I wanted to see if anybody else wanted to call.
8379315	8381255	I've got to give other folks an opportunity here.
8381755	8382575	What are you looking at now?
8382615	8388137	You're still on this Gary's Mod thing for Half-Life 2, which, by the way, is a game I really want to play.
8388597	8389257	I just haven't.
8389497	8390637	I don't know.
8392217	8394718	Loki, I'm working on acquiring it.
8395393	8396194	I have my means.
8396794	8409025	Anyways, the other thing that I should note that was posted, Jason, you know, in our chat room there, he posted a link to a port for Duke Nukem 3D for Windows.
8409345	8410186	That's pretty sweet.
8411387	8416071	But this Gary's Mod thing is so cool because just people, like, make the weirdest things.
8416291	8418133	It's like they have one with a pole dancer.
8418943	8439254	which is great, I don't even know why, it's just so funny, or this one, it's like, look ma, no hands, it's some guy riding a bike, then all of a sudden, it's just like, smacked into a tree, I mean, just like, funny shit, but this is the best part about it, is you can make like, your own webcomics, just doing little screen captures and putting stuff on there, it's genius, it's fun.
8440942	8451608	You know, it kind of reminds me of Duke Nukem 3D, when you could make your own maps, and you could just have, like, the strippers out in the middle of the street, just doing nothing, but just sitting there on the poles, and you can blow them all away with rocket launchers.
8454129	8457211	I've made some of the most kick-ass Duke Nukem 3D maps ever.
8457251	8460493	I'd spend, like, months on these maps, and then...
8461328	8475080	Literally, I'd run out of space, because in the build engine, which is the whole engine based around Duke Nukem 3D, you're given a limited amount of map that you can basically build in, and I would literally fill up everything.
8475280	8476822	Just completely fill it up.
8477302	8479344	Alright, we're going to go back to the Skype line, because we actually got a phone call.
8479384	8480805	Oh wait, Jamie, you have a quick comment before we go?
8481710	8485772	I'm just actually having a flashback to, on emulators, the Metroid level builder.
8487113	8489214	A guy built his own version of Metroid.
8489434	8491035	Metroid and the Zelda one, too?
8491235	8491695	Great stuff.
8491735	8493176	Man, people got too much free time.
8493716	8494677	Get out and get a job.
8495217	8495698	Get a real job.
8495778	8496398	Alright.
8496738	8498379	I gotta go to the caller, because he's hanging here.
8498419	8499740	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8500340	8501721	What's going on?
8502181	8503362	Hey, Big Red Pimp, what's up?
8503402	8503922	What's on your mind?
8503962	8505643	Not too much.
8506823	8507424	Any particular...
8508024	8512228	I'm just thinking about all that first person shooter crap you guys are talking over there.
8512388	8514250	Alright, what about the first person shooter crap?
8515391	8520175	I think that first person shooter players just rank up there with people who post on forums.
8520375	8521657	They are the scourge of the earth.
8523038	8527862	Now wait a minute, you mean to tell me there is not a single first person shooter game that you kind of like?
8528723	8531686	I have not played a first person shooter that I like since GoldenEye.
8532352	8533032	Since Goldeneye.
8533073	8535094	So at least there's one, okay?
8535114	8535354	Yeah.
8535874	8538516	And there's not a single web forum out there you like either?
8539837	8540017	No.
8540938	8542639	After reading GameFAQs, forget it.
8543620	8544800	Okay, well that I could go with.
8545181	8548023	But not even OrangeLoungeRadio.com forums?
8548383	8549203	You make me sad.
8549383	8550744	I'm not much of a forum whore.
8551065	8551385	Alright.
8551445	8553246	Well, what do you do on the internet then?
8553266	8560611	Because as far as I know, the internet's all about forum whore, live journal, and chat rooms pretending to be people you're not.
8561360	8562661	You're forgetting the porn junkies.
8562921	8563081	Oh!
8564002	8564322	Shit!
8564482	8566363	How could I forget the porn junkies?
8566504	8567664	Alright.
8567764	8571647	So you, instead of posting on forums, you have amassed a collection of pornography?
8572388	8572628	No.
8573348	8574990	Oh.
8575110	8575630	No.
8576210	8576410	What?
8576611	8578052	Well then what is it you do on the internet?
8579293	8580053	Make fun of others.
8580533	8580894	Oh, okay.
8581594	8583876	That's pretty much the same thing as what forum posters do.
8584096	8584756	Very similar.
8585677	8586137	Cousins.
8586518	8586818	I don't know.
8587919	8589880	I have nothing better to do than orient anyway.
8590669	8590909	All right.
8590929	8592451	Well, ranting is for live journals.
8592491	8596775	You should get one of those, I don't know, what, live journal or what are the other things?
8596835	8599458	Zongas or I don't know what the hell else there is.
8599618	8600119	Blogger.
8601019	8602501	I rant enough in my live journal.
8602901	8603942	Oh, so you do have a live journal.
8603962	8604463	So there you go.
8604483	8605364	There's something for the Internet.
8606024	8606325	All right.
8609428	8609708	All right.
8609728	8612631	Anything else you want to share with us, BigRedPimp, before we hang up on you?
8612671	8613452	Anything you want to plug?
8614269	8620813	Not really, except for the fact that Loki, the song should not be referenced as girls because girls do not suck that badly.
8620913	8622213	And I'm going to end it as that.
8622914	8625935	Loki is actually not in the room right now, but we'll relay the message to him.
8625955	8626836	Okay.
8627016	8627336	All right.
8627576	8628116	Have a good one.
8628837	8629257	You too.
8629457	8629777	Bye.
8630738	8632159	Actually, I hope he heard it from the other room.
8632179	8632879	That would be hilarious.
8633339	8637301	Okay, we'll keep the Skype line open for one more call, maybe, possibly.
8637341	8637762	We'll see.
8639302	8640323	We'll see what happens there.
8643890	8646031	Just reading our chat room, some random folks there.
8646511	8648491	www.orangeonline.com, click on chat.
8649072	8652573	Jaded2005 says, First person shooters are too much for me.
8652633	8654793	People play that for like 15 hours straight.
8655193	8657094	I have seen people that play that stuff for 15 hours straight.
8657454	8660495	Me personally, I can play it a little bit.
8660675	8664656	I like playing my friends, maybe in an hour long session on a weekend, but that's about it.
8664776	8665917	I can't stand much more than that.
8666297	8667437	Alright, we're getting another call.
8667497	8670838	Let's go back to the Skype line and say, Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8672248	8672888	Hey, it's Misty.
8673208	8674349	Hi, Misty, how are you?
8675169	8676010	Misty, doing good.
8676850	8678051	What's on your mind, Misty?
8679591	8683533	I just really wanted to say, not all the torrents are porn.
8684213	8687375	I know not all the torrents out there are porn, but a good majority.
8690196	8692857	What kind of torrents do you like to download, then, if it's not porn?
8694398	8694478	Um...
8696061	8697983	My main downloads are anime, of course.
8698563	8701245	I haven't been much in a torrent mood right now.
8702166	8706549	I know, it's kind of, ever since Supernova went down, it's been kind of hard to stay on top of torrents.
8707010	8715156	I know that one thing I'm going to end up torrenting is probably the new season of 24, which was on tonight, and I completely forgot about it, so I'm going to have to download the first episode.
8717788	8719749	It's not really into 24 yet.
8720690	8721510	I think it's a good show.
8721871	8723892	I kind of missed most of last season, but I think it's a good show.
8724172	8725653	What kind of anime do you download?
8725913	8728435	What kind of anime is good stuff out there right now on Torrent?
8730076	8733618	Last major thing I downloaded is a series called Psychic Academy.
8734719	8738181	Doesn't seem likely to get released in the US from what I've seen of the series.
8742363	8744905	No, I just wanted to hold the microphone.
8746079	8748561	I thought maybe you had a question for Misty or something.
8749141	8751003	Anything you want to plug, Misty, while you're here on the air?
8752324	8754105	Don't really have anything to plug.
8754485	8756026	Alright, well, fair enough.
8756266	8757487	Download the Parappa anime.
8758428	8758848	Is that on?
8758988	8761450	I found it on animesuki.com.
8763992	8765293	Alright, download the Parappa torrent.
8765313	8766293	You gotta let us know what you think.
8767114	8767754	Alright, I will.
8767895	8768215	Alright.
8768435	8772418	Hey, video game you're most looking forward to seeing in 2005?
8772758	8773178	Anything?
8775160	8775440	Anything?
8777365	8780867	Nothing I can really think of right now, but I haven't been paying much attention.
8781247	8781747	That's alright.
8781787	8783528	It's hard to pay attention to this show sometimes.
8785288	8786129	I'm just messing with you.
8786389	8787429	Thanks for calling in, Misty.
8787449	8788350	You have a wonderful week.
8788970	8789330	You too.
8789490	8790370	Alright, bye-bye.
8791471	8792131	I like Misty.
8792151	8792891	She's so sweet.
8793352	8794792	She's always there for the show.
8794812	8800615	She's always there in chat to say... When newbies come in throughout the week going, Is this Orange Louse Radio's chat room?
8800895	8802275	Misty's always there to say something.
8802315	8802635	Hello.
8802936	8804856	If she's around, she'll say... No, you dumb shits.
8804896	8805357	This is DDR.
8807142	8808463	That's what I'm going to say in the next one.
8808503	8809244	No, you dumb shits.
8809264	8810265	This is DDR Freak.
8813287	8817311	Although, ironically enough, this show is going to be played on DDR Freak Radio, so for some reason, anyway.
8818031	8819973	It's the Bomani Sims chat room.
8822295	8824417	This is Bomani-style chat, actually.
8825898	8826859	Pimp my dance pad.
8827539	8830762	Yes, this is Pimp My Dance Pad, exactly.
8832283	8832743	Oh, boy.
8833044	8833344	All right.
8834341	8835701	That's it for the Skype line for now.
8835741	8838662	We might open it up again a little bit later there, but I think three's enough for now.
8838982	8843904	We're going to go to a break, and when we come back from this break, we've got to get ranty.
8844684	8846744	We're upset, and we're going to get ranty.
8847645	8850465	In this break, we're going to feature some superstar.
8850525	8851726	I wanted to hear... Oh, no, wait, no.
8851966	8852846	We're not going to hear superstar.
8852866	8857167	We're going to hear Osama Kubota songs, because I promised Jamie we could hear some.
8858528	8858948	I'm sorry.
8858988	8860248	I almost forgot there for a minute.
8860288	8863449	Because I will go postal if I don't hear Presto.
8863962	8867324	Alright, we're going to queue that up so Jamie does not go postal.
8868385	8870366	She has so many reasons to go postal, though, honestly.
8872388	8875090	Alright, we'll start it off with Presto, Osama Kubota music.
8875490	8882795	We will be back with the FUs of the week, which you can send in, by the way, right now over private message to Sky if you have something you want to say after this.
8950624	8951529	Thanks for watching!
9001355	9002235	Thanks for watching!
9060031	9060518	Thank you.
9120610	9121570	Thanks for watching!
9162828	9164009	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9197626	9198326	and many more.
9198346	9198667	Thank you.
9225382	9226502	Thank you for watching!
9263789	9265030	Orange Lounge Radio.
9265370	9272574	We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.
9274735	9275575	Son of a bitch.
9275595	9276676	We need to make new promos.
9276716	9278997	We need to put that on our list of things to do.
9279257	9279897	New promos.
9280758	9281458	Goddamn.
9281678	9282599	We need new promos.
9282699	9283319	Really badly.
9284742	9285423	Hey, hey, hey, hey!
9313379	9314540	Let's try that again.
9316481	9321343	Why is it that we have to do these... Rob, you are a bitch.
9321423	9323284	Minor technical glitch there.
9324044	9324985	You are a bitch.
9325525	9329807	I thought we could do Switcheroo Night or something, and I'd give Loki the gay song or something.
9330328	9330828	I'm just kidding.
9330988	9331268	All right.
9331468	9332229	No, you don't get girls.
9333569	9333949	I'm sorry.
9333989	9334910	Let's try that from the top.
9335590	9336150	Rewind.
9336911	9337391	Start over.
9337471	9337931	Take two.
9338592	9338932	Jamie...
9340273	9343736	Jamie, why is it that we have to do these FUs of the week every single week?
9343896	9344396	Fuck you.
9347879	9349420	My first FU was to go to Rob.
9361210	9367015	No, my first FU of the night is just to the torrential downpour we had.
9368412	9369253	It was pretty vicious.
9369373	9376919	Another F you goes to the HR guy I was dealing with for basically trying to pull the same crap he pulled on one of my other co-workers.
9377640	9386607	Basically, whenever we brought up a legitimate concern, he was trying to pull the company this, and I basically turned it right back around on him because if there's one thing I'm good at, it's point and counterpoint.
9388369	9394854	So finally, I got him to say that he was going to turn over our VP to our business partner over here, so...
9395424	9397406	Gonna have some investigation going on.
9398566	9405512	FU goes to the VP for always wanting to put his goddamn hand on my shoulder whenever he talks to me.
9405572	9410756	And I'm like, you know, I should have just said, you know, I would rather you not do that.
9410856	9412677	But the whole thing is that this is a VP.
9413938	9422745	And until I report him to HR, I don't know what's going to be used as, you know, a retaliatory action.
9423165	9425167	Because I think he's petty enough to do it.
9425902	9429324	So, um... Yeah, Big Effie goes to him.
9429424	9430844	He keeps begging me to stay.
9431525	9435847	And then, on top of this, he's trying to get me to stay there through the end of the month, forcing me to stay.
9436587	9440989	By some weird... We have to hold her to release her some type of bullshit.
9441729	9444611	And my change date's already set with HR.
9444931	9448112	He can't freaking do it, so I get to rub it in his face Monday.
9448132	9448913	That's gonna be awesome.
9451254	9454035	Um... Effie goes to, uh...
9454491	9458374	You know, I really don't have much else to F you about except for maybe my lack of time.
9459075	9465820	And also, an F you goes toward my lack of funds and ability to travel to places that I want to go and see people I want to see.
9467301	9470984	Other than that, I'm fairly happy because I don't have to be there anymore after this week.
9471444	9474227	I don't have to look at that man after this week.
9474307	9475568	It's going to be so awesome.
9477449	9477709	Yeah.
9481352	9483033	She put the mic down, so I'm thinking she's done.
9483053	9483254	Done.
9483574	9483794	All right.
9484471	9485832	Loki, it's your turn.
9487694	9492578	Uh, first off, fuck you, you stupid people.
9493399	9496501	You can't seem to figure out how, you know, online games work.
9496962	9501025	You don't go looking for a party if you're not your keyboard for hours at end.
9501846	9506790	And then, like, give me a tell later on, you know, saying, oh, hi, I'm ready to party.
9507010	9508211	Yeah, oh, that was half an hour ago.
9508371	9508872	Where were you?
9509392	9510553	Oh, well, I was just taking a nap.
9511714	9512855	What the fuck are you doing?
9513286	9515507	Or people that do that while you're partying.
9516047	9517348	Oh yeah, I'm going AFK for a second.
9518068	9519289	And they're gone for half an hour.
9520109	9520689	No, fuck that.
9521630	9522330	That's stupid.
9522370	9526332	If you have things that, you know, you have to do, don't play the game.
9527412	9528493	Get the set-aside time.
9529934	9531314	Anyways, so fuck you to that.
9531594	9538878	Fuck you to online websites that don't really correspond with you when you order products with them.
9539038	9540098	You just kind of have to wait.
9540838	9541159	And wait.
9541799	9542099	And wait.
9542737	9545319	and hope that they sent it and didn't just take your money.
9547501	9554207	And, um... Yeah, that's pretty much all I have right now.
9555888	9556508	Yep, that's it.
9557009	9558270	I don't have anything else I can think of.
9559951	9561793	Anna, by the way, is suggesting a Warp 2.
9565596	9566577	What?
9567117	9568338	Oh, yeah, we did do that.
9571926	9572286	My turn.
9579870	9582371	I would like to give a big fat F you to The Rain.
9583363	9586765	On Thursday night, the rain was so bad.
9587125	9591607	Like, we here on the West Coast, we're really big pussies when it comes to the rain, okay?
9592267	9593408	If it starts... God, you are.
9593608	9594048	Seriously.
9594588	9598090	Like, I've been on the East Coast and I've seen how it rains back there.
9598110	9599790	When it rains on the East Coast, it rains.
9600431	9603432	When it rains like that here, people freak out, okay?
9603452	9608074	But you have to remember, it's not built around here to handle rain like that.
9608154	9608814	It's really not.
9609075	9611276	It rains like that out here too long, it floods.
9611916	9611996	And...
9612950	9618051	I hate to interject on this, but Rob, you remember seeing me one of the first times I was out here for a big rain, right?
9618791	9619912	I believe so.
9619952	9622572	Were you just going, what the fuck, at everybody else?
9623613	9624693	Because it was nothing?
9625653	9626593	But here's the problem.
9626993	9628914	I don't have a problem with heavy rain like that.
9629234	9640217	I have a problem when that heavy rain starts causing so much drainage to fall from the top of the roof and it's falling outside my window on the bush that it's keeping me awake and I can't freaking sleep.
9640577	9641077	So I have to...
9641815	9643456	Get up at 4.30 in the morning.
9643516	9645356	No, 4 in the morning because I can't sleep.
9646337	9649458	And I get on the computer and read about freaking DDR and Mario.
9650839	9651979	I just, I don't know.
9653700	9654560	I was sad.
9656921	9658562	That's it, so I give an FU to the rain.
9659827	9662629	Otherwise, I really don't have a lot to be pissed off about.
9663569	9667091	F you to people that... F you to slow service at restaurants.
9667152	9669513	Oh my god, I had the slowest service the other day.
9669533	9670273	It made me scream.
9670974	9671554	I think that's it.
9672054	9672795	I'm good otherwise.
9673275	9674496	Let's hear from DDR Angel.
9675517	9681860	F you to being sick earlier this week because I was afraid I wasn't going to be able to come to show today, but I'm here, so yay.
9683161	9684522	F you to people that can't run a party.
9684702	9689265	You're not supposed to have somebody that's four levels higher than you.
9690049	9692711	Thank you to Anna for stealing me away from that party.
9692991	9694792	Good God.
9695032	9696393	Yeah, that sucked.
9697134	9699655	And F you to White Mage, because oh my God.
9700136	9701857	Oh wait, Rob helped me do that.
9703218	9703938	Go sub job.
9704379	9705279	Oh well, I'm almost done.
9705339	9707421	I can go back to Black Mage, so yay.
9708321	9709002	Okay, I'm done.
9709222	9709882	See, I'm boring.
9710963	9711223	Alright.
9711624	9712444	I actually thought of one.
9712484	9713845	Oh my God, Loki reminded me of one.
9713865	9714365	I gotta go back.
9715426	9715986	Okay, go back.
9716187	9716547	Rewind.
9719588	9720849	That's the theme of tonight, is rewind.
9721129	9722110	Okay, here it is.
9723050	9725572	We had a party yesterday in Final Fantasy XI.
9726393	9726713	Jamie?
9728114	9733878	We had a party yesterday in Final Fantasy XI.
9733998	9734878	Yes.
9734938	9741563	You know how in Final Fantasy XI you have Japanese and English players playing together, that's kind of the draw, you know, it's kind of cool.
9742301	9743502	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9771764	9776668	OMG, JP, do they even speak American?
9777328	9779990	I will leave unless they understand what I'm saying.
9780431	9784674	I will not die because of some JP player who can't communicate with me.
9786135	9789638	Okay, first off, bitch, it's called English, not American.
9789658	9790939	Okay?
9791579	9795962	Second off, the game was designed so that Japanese and English players can play together.
9796003	9798544	That's why you have something called the auto-translate function.
9798885	9800366	I suggest you learn how to use it.
9801502	9803643	Third off, you are a stupid bitch!
9804484	9806265	Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid bitch!
9808106	9808707	Yes, Angel.
9809727	9811048	Angel's gonna laugh at this.
9811609	9814070	Blizzard, bio, see ya, bye!
9814090	9815431	Yeah.
9815851	9817833	Anyway, that's it.
9817913	9819193	So, Sniper Kitten, F you.
9819574	9819874	Alright.
9823806	9852414	Jaded2005 moving on in the chatroom Jaded2005 would like to say F you to the postal service for not delivering my Dance Mania CD sooner Phoenix says I want to say F you Loki because he puts girls in the cage match which sucked and I would like to say F you to the creator of DDR with Mario Mario is dead and he just wants to add yeah Loki sucked tonight he must be a friend of yours or something whatever girls is going in next week
9854351	9880474	K-Dash says F you to dumb co-workers that you wish would go away Dark Knight says F you to my arm for being in so much pain after I went go-kart racing last night and F you to myself for having a nightmare of a birthday being late for work on Thursday BRP Ohio Bomani says F you to parents and grandparents that don't give the respect to their children and grandchildren that they would expect back
9881467	9887239	F you to Viz for holding on to Hikaru no Go anime license and not doing anything with it since they got it.
9887720	9890506	And F you to the ice storms that hit the east coast last week.
9892483	9897786	El Mullet says, F you to any mission in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas that involves aircraft of any kind.
9898206	9907370	The controls are way too sensitive, causing the plane to fly in weird directions when I thought I was going straight and doing barrel rolls and slightly leaning on the analog stick the wrong way.
9907731	9912573	Whoever was in charge of designing the plane controls must have been drunk, high, or both.
9914460	9918162	VXJasonXV says, F you to being so freaking tired.
9918222	9919623	Yes, I'm freaking tired.
9920103	9923466	F you to my manager for being a lying, pessimistic ass.
9923966	9924506	Guess what?
9924546	9926527	It's all coming around to bite you in the ass now.
9926908	9928268	And someone important has proof.
9929029	9929669	Sounds scandalous.
9930750	9934032	BlackDevilerX says, F you to the idiot who wrote to El Mullet.
9934092	9935253	He doesn't sound very bright.
9935653	9939575	I hope El Mullet dishes out his cool logic against that guy in his next column.
9939915	9940676	He deserves it.
9942953	9948437	Arcadian 42, who usually is here, he says, fuck you to the cold I've had all fucking week.
9948557	9949057	That sucks.
9950058	9955522	Illusion says, F you to Sunflakes and Joe LaTaxi being so hard to find on Morpheus.
9958084	9960706	F you to finals coming up and F you all the goddamn rain.
9962007	9964248	Jamie, he's looking for Joe LaTaxi.
9965869	9966530	Where should he look?
9968022	9972803	I don't remember where I found it, but I'll send it to you later.
9972863	9975704	Just shoot, I'm not even in there.
9976264	9976684	Email me.
9977585	9979785	Bat your eyelashes and look pretty at DarkSakura.
9979825	9980605	Maybe she'll help you out.
9982986	9987507	And Misty said, this isn't the best one I've ever had, but yeah, F you not having money.
9987527	9989008	You know, that does kind of suck.
9989748	9990408	And lastly...
9991198	9994319	Dork says, F you to no one cooking me food.
9994339	9996719	I need a freaking girlfriend, dammit.
9997239	9999340	So now instead of listening to the show, I'm cooking.
9999480	10000480	Boo freaking hoo.
10002940	10003581	I like that.
10003781	10006841	I like how he says, F you to no one cooking me food.
10006961	10008222	I need a freaking girlfriend.
10009782	10011342	Oh, and Anna Kitty has one too.
10011362	10014063	F you to the lag I get while trying to listen to Orange Launch Radio.
10014423	10017043	Tell the boyfriend, or actually husband, right?
10017503	10017964	I don't remember.
10018024	10018544	Is it husband?
10019644	10020124	Fiancee?
10020894	10021514	I can't remember.
10021795	10023636	Just tell him to quit playing Final Fantasy XI.
10023796	10025056	Tell the other guy in your house.
10026077	10026898	We'll call him that.
10027378	10028959	Tell the guy in your house to quit playing it.
10030760	10031200	Alright.
10033401	10033942	There you have it.
10035623	10041746	Again, you can email the lovely DarkSakura by emailing jamie at orangelawnsradio.com and it will forward to her usual address.
10042567	10042987	Yes, it will.
10043407	10044588	I verified it was set up this week.
10046529	10047589	Unless you want to give your other one.
10048110	10048410	I don't care.
10050607	10060712	Um, actually, you can either do it there or, um, this one time only I'm going to give, um, an email I can check from work.
10061773	10066775	It's, uh, DarkSakura at DelBiter, D-E-L-B-I-T-E-R dot com.
10067515	10069036	This is the only time I'm giving this one out.
10069736	10070417	Ooh, okay.
10071477	10073218	Quick, stalker fans, write that down.
10074519	10074759	Alright.
10075939	10078261	Anna did verify that yes, it is indeed husband.
10078301	10079181	My bad, my bad.
10080100	10080620	What can I do?
10084223	10085884	I like the other guy that lives in your house.
10085924	10087184	Come on, you have to admit, that was a good one.
10088405	10088725	Alright.
10089926	10096050	I got a file from DJ Ranma S, who was so kind to find this file for me.
10096490	10099952	Remember earlier when we were talking about DDR featuring Mario?
10100873	10104035	Well, here's another song that needs to be in the game.
10107993	10109035	Do the Mario!
10109055	10113322	Swing your arms from side to side, come on, it's time to go!
10113362	10114424	Do the Mario!
10114484	10118731	Take one step, and then again, let's do the Mario!
10118851	10119872	All together now!
10124247	10125327	It's the Mario!
10126948	10127968	Do the Mario!
10128008	10130629	Swing your arms from side to side.
10130689	10132249	Come on, it's time to go!
10132289	10133350	Do the Mario!
10133430	10135990	Take one step, and then again.
10136050	10138891	Let's do the Mario all together now!
10140532	10143513	Come on now, just like that!
10145013	10147094	Just like that!
10147414	10150215	He sounds like a cross between Cookie Monster and Cat and Lou.
10150335	10151495	Oh god, he was awesome.
10151880	10157984	And he was Cyndi Lauper's dad in the videos.
10158004	10158484	The 80s.
10161006	10161406	Anyway.
10163907	10168931	It's so funny looking at the chat room and some people that freaking hate that song and some people that really love it.
10170652	10172233	Yeah, I like how El Mullet puts it.
10172553	10175114	Cookie, cookie, I'm not doing the Mario!
10178877	10179317	Alright.
10180257	10180878	We're going to...
10182599	10186202	If I didn't read your FU, I didn't get one, so resend it, I guess.
10186562	10188584	So we'll read those when we come back.
10189945	10191606	In the meantime, we're going to do one more break.
10191626	10195789	We're going to do a quick break, a couple songs, and then we're going to come back and wrap up the show.
10195949	10197810	That's right, it's time to wrap up the show.
10198591	10201073	So I thought I'd play something a little up-tempo for you guys.
10201153	10206016	I thought we'd play a little bit of something from Guitar Freaks, and then we'll come back and get ready to wrap up the show.
10206277	10206677	We'll be back.
10282434	10283235	It's great, man.
10373950	10376371	Listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
10376411	10380253	Because Bongo demands it.
10398191	10398671	You know what?
10398711	10401993	I think our chat room tonight has turned into Jamie's personal hell.
10402353	10405594	Because, like, everybody from our Final Fantasy XI link shell is coming in.
10406755	10408496	I wouldn't call it my own personal hell, you know.
10408516	10413878	I wouldn't have had a problem with Final Fantasy XI had I received the support I needed.
10416019	10416739	It's a tough game.
10417039	10417460	It's tough.
10417940	10418980	I'm not saying it was tough.
10419160	10422082	It's just, you know, on Ragnarok, there were always people playing.
10423802	10426924	I could easily go and level completely by myself.
10428294	10434918	But anytime I ever came on and asked for help, sorry, we're busy doing some dumbass crap.
10434958	10435538	Hey, I tried.
10435778	10436278	I tried.
10438319	10439120	So I said forget it.
10441401	10441841	Let's see.
10442922	10443822	What else was I going to say?
10444243	10444643	I don't know.
10444703	10446043	I had something else I was going to say.
10446144	10448045	Oh, I wanted to do some late FUs that came in.
10450240	10457062	MPQ had some FUs he was trying to send me, but MIRC sucks for some reason, so FU to MIRC, says MPQ.
10457563	10460123	But he says, here's the in a nutshell version of it.
10460544	10466205	Illusions never fixes their babani, smokers poison me, and Bill Masterman doesn't know much about how 2DX actually costs.
10466506	10467426	Those are all his FUs.
10471587	10472888	And let's see, what was last here?
10473228	10477009	DJ Ranma S says, I'm putting in my FU still late, I don't care.
10477309	10479450	FU to people returning iPods that work.
10480936	10483038	You retards, and F you to my computer for crashing.
10485400	10485780	All right.
10487462	10487762	Wow.
10488142	10488643	Where'd it go?
10489203	10490404	We're just about done with the show here.
10490745	10495189	Any other Bomani news that you can think of that went on this week that I'm completely missing?
10495229	10496029	I can't think of anything.
10496069	10497971	You've been reading the boards, though, Loki.
10497991	10498712	Anything you can think of?
10501814	10501994	No.
10503396	10503956	Nothing really.
10504096	10507079	Actually, I've been paying more attention to building my computer.
10507588	10508348	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10530642	10533103	All the people that used to make good sim files stopped doing it.
10533183	10544085	It's just like, it's going to be a whole new resurgence of, you know, I guess before, I mean, it wasn't exactly, he wasn't exactly good or anything, but, you know, there was, you know, Bomani Ruler, and everyone was like, oh, I've got to get that stuff.
10544845	10545506	No, then he left.
10545806	10548626	And then it was UtterDude, and then everyone was like, oh, I've got to get his stuff.
10548886	10549427	Then he's gone.
10549907	10555468	And now there's new people stepping in to take their place, and so it's just the whole thing all over again.
10556048	10565715	But, um, really, I think the problem is, is because DDR Maniacs is down, and so you don't have any, like, Step Mania updates, that's where all your theme stuff was, everything.
10565815	10572159	So, that's probably why you're missing out on that stuff, and DDR UK is just not quite up to, you know, that stuff.
10572199	10577243	I mean, they're working hard on those official sim files, so that'll be fun once that comes out, but, um...
10578936	10579797	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10594626	10603915	I've thought of some other things, but I don't want to commit to anything because I hate starting projects after I haven't finished other projects.
10605276	10605677	We'll see.
10606037	10606377	I don't know.
10607458	10608900	No news until there is news, I guess.
10611402	10616146	I'm hoping the rumors are true that there's going to be some type of new DDR game this year.
10616166	10617968	I mean, besides the Europe thing we already heard about.
10618008	10618969	I mean, obviously there's that.
10619650	10621173	How about that pretty soon, actually?
10621493	10624479	That should be by the end of next week?
10625228	10629952	I'm hoping it's a sign of things to come from not only Japan, but the US as well.
10630593	10631454	At least something.
10631714	10632675	It's been too long.
10632735	10634376	DDR Extreme, we've been sitting on it too long.
10634396	10635237	We need something new.
10635877	10637179	We're foaming at the mouth here, people.
10637199	10637939	We need something new.
10638640	10641142	Otherwise, people are going to have to start importing machines from Europe.
10641182	10641843	What's with that?
10642583	10644425	Well, here is, I think, what the problem was before.
10644445	10647428	It wasn't a matter of, you know, oh, we just don't want to release another mix.
10647908	10652172	It was they hit the limits of their previous mix, and they had to develop something.
10652987	10660130	Kind of like, I'm not really sure with 9th style and 8th style if there was a lull between those, but it's like that.
10660170	10663452	They just have to, you know, they have to kind of redesign everything from the ground up.
10663612	10666553	That's why probably having gotten anything.
10666573	10675437	I mean, since, you know, their arcade division kind of fizzled out, you know, you have to design the hardware for it, and it's a little more difficult than just throwing a PC in there.
10675698	10677478	So, I don't know.
10677859	10678839	That's the only thing I can think of.
10680305	10685731	DarkLionXVI sent me this link, and I thought we had talked about this on a previous show, but maybe we missed it.
10685771	10686252	I don't remember.
10686312	10687633	I think we brought it up briefly.
10687914	10690717	But the website has been updated here and there a little bit.
10690997	10694701	It's Karaoke Revolution Bamani Edition, and this is coming out in Japan.
10695102	10698065	And you can sing to poppin' music hits and things like that.
10698946	10702207	I don't know if there is new stuff that they're putting in here.
10702287	10703947	It looks like there might be a few new songs in here.
10704327	10709248	Yeah, because I don't think like Mobomogo was in there before and KCK and songs like that.
10710628	10713149	Looks like some new Desro songs are going to be put in there.
10713909	10717869	Very interesting, these songs that they've decided to put in Karaoke Revolution Bomani.
10718770	10721430	One thing I noticed on the site, is that I might rave on there?
10721470	10722330	You've got to be kidding me.
10723350	10725191	Oh, Loki says that would be cool though.
10725231	10726231	I don't think I see it on there.
10727048	10729710	Just a lot of poppin' music type songs are in there.
10730170	10730891	Not just that, though.
10730931	10733733	You can check out the website over at KonamiStyle.com.
10734133	10738756	You notice, though, that Karaoke Revolution in Japan looks a lot different.
10739236	10744580	It's not the whole person singing on the stage thing or anything like that.
10744700	10747562	It looks like basically a karaoke machine would.
10748311	10750153	Kind of not quite as flashy, I don't know.
10750213	10750953	Or maybe it is flashy.
10750973	10752374	I've got to see this game in motion, really.
10752414	10755397	But it doesn't look anything like Karaoke Revolution USA.
10755777	10761182	But if you like to sing, you can get on that.
10761302	10761602	I don't know.
10762503	10767107	They should port over their DDR karaoke mix.
10767267	10777215	Another thing that came out recently, which I have to actually update on our game here, is Karaoke Revolution 3, which we have.
10777877	10781259	Um, cheat codes came out, so we can unlock all the songs, including Snake Eater.
10782140	10782840	Alright!
10782941	10785402	Snake Eater is the most ridiculous damn song in that game!
10786123	10787984	You can feast on a tree frog.
10789565	10790626	Best lyrics ever.
10792087	10795349	Oh, and, um, I hate Metal Gear Solid 3, cause...
10796862	10803707	Us nerds were not meant to be in the jungle, therefore putting us in the jungle does not work.
10804207	10807149	I went into the jungle and I knew nothing of what I was doing.
10807209	10808910	I was like, oh my god, I'm gonna die.
10808930	10811412	You're supposed to feast on a tree frog.
10811692	10815955	Well, an alligator feasted on me, so yeah.
10816415	10817256	That was the end of that.
10818857	10820678	Because my fucking cheat codes wouldn't work.
10820718	10823100	I wanted to Rambo my way through it, but it wouldn't let me.
10824001	10824641	Those bastards.
10827580	10830422	Alright, it's getting down towards the end of the show, guys.
10830442	10831223	We've got to wrap it up.
10832084	10832784	Final thoughts.
10833025	10833985	We'll start off with Angel.
10834106	10834706	Your final thought.
10837428	10839410	I want to go play Final Fantasy XI again.
10839730	10840151	Addict.
10840451	10841191	Hey, wait a minute.
10841232	10842493	You're the one who's going to meet me tonight.
10844734	10845675	Final thought, Loki.
10846796	10848237	I hope more of my computer stuff comes in.
10848297	10850059	Actually, I hope all of it comes in this week.
10850643	10851904	DarkSakura, your final thought?
10851924	10852625	I freaking hate IRC.
10852645	10856247	And my final thought is please tune in to Orange Launch Radio's other programming throughout the week.
10879232	10883436	Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Wednesday even, and then Friday over on DDR Freak.
10883476	10884037	Listen to it!
10885378	10885919	Or I'll cry.
10887320	10888722	Alright, um, that's it.
10889362	10894067	The final word of tonight's show, one word to sum up everything.
10895589	10897451	Nellie, do you want, oh, you want it, Jamie?
10897791	10898992	Alright, Jamie, what's the final word?
10900414	10900654	Addict.
10901844	10906689	That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.
10907530	10911734	Orange Lounge Radio Live is an Orange Lounge Radio production.

10920543	10924507	And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.
10954225	10955531	Thanks for watching!
10986468	10987449	Thanks for watching!
11021760	11023081	Thanks for watching!
11052777	11053798	Thank you for watching!
11091630	11095142	Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
11115792	11119096	Alright guys, we're back here, Orange Lounge Radio.
11119616	11135271	As a reminder, because I know a lot of you guys were off for the past couple weeks, we are phasing out the afterbirth segment of the show, just because we have other things we have to take care of after the show is now, so the afterbirths aren't going to be around a whole lot longer, and plus there will be no more post-show.
11136092	11140076	We'll go right back into the Bomani Music & More program featuring all your favorite DDR bands,
11141677	11147882	I know you guys might be sad about the loss of the afterbirth, but remember, this is how we bring you these other projects that we're doing, like the podcast and things like that.
11147902	11148563	So don't cry!
11149103	11150264	Don't cry for me, Argentina!
11150924	11151205	Alright.
11152626	11153466	Did you just think that?
11153947	11154387	Alright.
11154567	11156629	Nellie's finally saying something, even though the show's over.
11157269	11157509	What?
11158110	11158550	Exactly.
11159011	11159351	Alright.
11160612	11161272	So that's it.
11161793	11165876	We're now going to go back to Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music and
